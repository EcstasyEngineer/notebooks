00:00.000 --> 00:28.600
Bruh.

00:28.600 --> 00:36.800
Everything is breaking right now. Holy crap. Everything has broken.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.440
I can't even hear in-game sound. I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be here in the music

00:40.440 --> 00:50.120
right now. Hold on. I'm so sorry. Everything broke from yesterday.

00:50.120 --> 00:59.640
My headset isn't registering sound at all. I knew it wasn't. You're lying to me!

00:59.640 --> 01:08.600
Ugh, the scuff isn't- Oh here we go.

01:08.600 --> 01:16.860
I just heard the test of some music. Okay. I can now hear the title of music? Yes, I can.

01:16.860 --> 01:22.660
And you can hear it too. I don't know how loud it's going to be though. Oh my god. Anything

01:22.660 --> 01:28.420
that can break will. I didn't change a single thing from yesterday's drum.

01:28.420 --> 01:35.900
Ugh. I apologize for being late, little refunds. That was horrific. I haven't even been able

01:35.900 --> 01:39.020
to watch yesterday's words. I know the next stream is starting. However, I meant to keep

01:39.020 --> 01:45.660
up with your strawney. That's the fun part. I have endless stamina.

01:46.620 --> 01:53.940
See? Those details come really good later on. Right. I don't- I need to- I made- I'll tell

01:53.940 --> 02:00.740
you what world we're in. Right now I'm entering world 424. But I- I want tutorial island.

02:00.740 --> 02:05.860
So please don't worry. What was that first song? It was called music makes you lose control.

02:05.860 --> 02:12.500
Music makes you lose control. Let's go. Please don't worry if you've not actually got your

02:12.860 --> 02:18.620
character outside. Good ol' Lummi Castle, Lumbridge Castle. I've not even done the tutorial

02:18.620 --> 02:24.380
part. I do- I'm playing with a plugin called Runelight. But we're just going through tutorial

02:24.380 --> 02:32.780
island super quick. I'm not- Oh no, I just liked it a brand new. Oh, we're doing an

02:32.780 --> 02:46.460
in-depth in tutorial island then. Ah. Ah. I've actually been smart and I've prepared

02:46.460 --> 02:52.460
a whole meal. It was absolutely chaos getting- I was trying to get Runelight to work on screen

02:52.460 --> 02:57.460
and I was trying to cook fricking my- well, technically my breakfast, but I call it dinner.

02:58.140 --> 03:02.220
And I actually have like the world's saddest fricking rose- I think it's called like

03:02.220 --> 03:11.540
rosemary sauce when you have it with shrimp. And- ah. So, I do have membership. As isn't

03:11.540 --> 03:15.140
the finalised world, please, I've not even got through the tutorial. Right, let me just

03:15.140 --> 03:20.460
skip through this fricking tutorial. Ah, my phone's in the way. Oh my god, no, I can't

03:20.460 --> 03:27.060
skip this. This is going to take so long. Oh my- yes, we'll talk to the survival specialist.

03:27.060 --> 03:31.460
Look, that's what I'm eating right now. I- I'm ironically eating that right now. I'm

03:31.460 --> 03:37.060
good. Wait a minute, this game's based on real life. How cool is that? We're going fishing.

03:37.060 --> 03:40.660
Would you fish me up? Huh? Huh? But anyway, good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

03:40.660 --> 03:50.340
I apologize, it's been fricking chaos. Thank you. And no way. Thank you for the tip, Virginia.

03:50.340 --> 03:55.420
There's no way. Literally. Oh, ace of cullin' snow bears in as well. Thank you for the tip.

03:55.420 --> 04:01.700
I'm about to munch on- I've got baked pate, aw. Right, and then I've got shrimp, and then

04:01.700 --> 04:06.260
I've got a rose-ass aw, so I've not made it correctly because I didn't fricking squeeze

04:06.260 --> 04:13.980
the water out of the prawns. Hi, ready? Hi, ready? Hi, acey and snowberry readers. But

04:13.980 --> 04:18.340
if you put all those words together, it becomes ready. Are you squidding me right now?

04:18.740 --> 04:23.780
Strony, you're eating marshmallows last night inspired me to try to write something

04:23.780 --> 04:28.780
to make your heart flutter because I think it's adorable. Are you going to read more

04:28.780 --> 04:33.860
tonight? I can definitely read more. Thank you very much, Grimbo, for the tip. Yeah, I

04:33.860 --> 04:39.420
can definitely read more. Oh, I'm sorry to- I'm trying to eat and eat and wait and do

04:39.420 --> 04:43.020
everything all at once. Hi, we're playing RuneScape, an old-school RuneScape. We're going

04:43.020 --> 04:47.980
to play multiplayer and do quests together. I am called Scottlefish because I totally

04:48.020 --> 04:54.260
did not steal that from a roofling. Thank you very much. But yeah, we're going to do

04:54.260 --> 05:00.580
good. I am not- I'm going to move to a free world, but if you want to make a new account,

05:00.580 --> 05:04.740
we are going to do the free quests like Cook's Assistant and that, where the heck am I supposed

05:04.740 --> 05:08.780
to go? I don't know. I'm not paying attention. Now that you have logged, it's time to light

05:08.780 --> 05:14.740
fire. Oh, okay. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. I'm going to take a bite. Ah. Hi, Stromboni.

05:14.740 --> 05:21.380
I've got a nickname. I'm not sure I know that. See? So, I've got this plug-in called RuneLight

05:21.380 --> 05:25.500
and it's really good. I think it's really good. If the game needs to be louder, please

05:25.500 --> 05:30.380
do tell me. I actually think it does need to be louder. So, I'm like, screaming over

05:30.380 --> 05:36.180
all the things. What next? Moving on. Well done. Moving on. Moving on. Moving on. I've

05:36.180 --> 05:41.700
completely forgotten how the tutorial goes because it's been so long. I'm going to take

05:41.700 --> 05:47.860
another bite of my food. But yeah, if you want to join in, don't worry. You can literally

05:47.860 --> 05:53.020
make a character right now and be faster than me. I will tell you what world we're on. We're

05:53.020 --> 06:00.180
all going to meet outside of Lumbridge Castle. So, whenever what world we'll get, we will

06:00.180 --> 06:06.820
do a Chicky Lumbridge Castle. Yeah. And then we'll take it one by one and we'll quest.

06:07.740 --> 06:12.740
We're going to start with Cook's assistant because obviously this is a bit squished.

06:12.740 --> 06:19.460
And my goal is to get 99 cooking live. Like, not in this one stream, okay? Not in this

06:19.460 --> 06:24.740
one stream. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know how to do that. Although, I think if fletching,

06:24.740 --> 06:30.260
if you have like a ton of GP, you can actually get 99 fletching in one day or something like

06:30.260 --> 06:35.780
that. I can't remember. I think it's fletching. You can kind of smurf it, smurf it with cheese

06:35.780 --> 06:41.300
a bit. All in one stream, crazy. No, no, stop getting hype. It's not happening in one stream.

06:42.100 --> 06:47.540
Okay, quest journal. Yep, we are going to do the free quest first as best as we can.

06:48.420 --> 06:51.700
And then we might move on to membership quest, but I do want to give

06:51.700 --> 06:57.460
Refling the chance to come hang at Lummi Castle, the glum castle. Any, any lumbers? Any hashtag

06:58.420 --> 07:05.060
I'm taking a little bit. It's super expensive for a member. Yeah, it's really expensive actually

07:05.060 --> 07:12.500
to do the thing. But membership in this game is so expensive. I remember I asked my mum

07:14.260 --> 07:21.460
to buy me membership when I was a wane. And it was like cheap as anything. And she never got me

07:21.460 --> 07:25.060
out because she didn't understand what the game was. And she's like, why do you need it? Why do

07:25.620 --> 07:33.460
I need it? I'm like, mum, I want membership. Ryan. Stay awake from last stream. Let's see if I can

07:33.460 --> 07:43.060
make it to the ASMR stream. No way. Are you, you must have been so many iron reaper that I managed

07:43.060 --> 07:47.700
to get an eight hour sleep after that stream. I don't know how long the endurance stream,

07:48.420 --> 07:53.140
it was like three quid the last time I got it. Honestly, I remember like begging my mum. I was like,

07:53.140 --> 07:58.260
mum, I want, I want membership. But she never understood my games. And then that's when I go

07:58.260 --> 08:06.180
to dad. See, dad, dad knew, dad knew what was going on. He knew the games. I'm like, dad, what

08:06.180 --> 08:13.300
we're doing? I'm not talking, I'm right. Hello, my name is Scottlefish. I still live. I usually

08:13.300 --> 08:18.020
only sleep four or five. Are you guys all insomniacs? I got four hours. Good enough for me. Bro, that's

08:18.020 --> 08:24.500
not healthy. Honestly, I felt, I woke up and I felt sick today. And I was like, is that because

08:26.180 --> 08:31.300
you, you will be told to equip items later. You don't have access to the interface for equipment items.

08:31.300 --> 08:37.540
Oh, okay. One more. Thank you. Right, shovel on note. Okay. Are you squidding me right now? Ryan.

08:38.180 --> 08:44.340
Strani is going all weekend for the 99 cooking. She never burns out. She only burns

08:44.980 --> 08:50.180
I actually quite like that. Thank you, Tim. Shuttle. I think Tim shuttles the way I'm supposed

08:50.180 --> 08:55.140
to say it because there's no way it's like any other way. Right, let's go combat interface. Right.

08:55.140 --> 09:00.420
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, beautiful. Let's stab. Give him a little stabby stab. Stab them rats.

09:01.700 --> 09:05.300
All right, hold on. Hold on. Nope. Too far. Too far. Inbought, inbought. I,

09:06.420 --> 09:10.340
whenever I watch RuneScape streamers, they're always like super zoomed in. They're like, oh,

09:10.340 --> 09:14.260
yeah, look at that. And I'm like, bro, I need to be able to see what I'm looking at. Like,

09:14.260 --> 09:20.980
I can see the health bar. I can see everything. I'm not saying anything up before anyone complains.

09:22.660 --> 09:29.540
Chat sleep. Chat needs to rest as much as me. I've got absolutely no sleep at all. Are you

09:29.540 --> 09:35.860
all insomniacs? You're all literally all holding on for the ASMR stream. I'm getting my nails done

09:36.820 --> 09:42.180
after the ASMR stream. So hope you're ready. Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, no, wait,

09:42.180 --> 09:46.500
sorry. I'm supposed to do range weaponry. Can I do it from through the gate? Oh, I can.

09:47.540 --> 09:52.420
Didn't realize old school room shape. Oh, didn't realize old school RuneScape membership is 89.

09:53.620 --> 10:01.060
No, bro. The inflation has hands. I'm sorry, but all these things being like, oh, no, cost 11.

10:01.060 --> 10:04.820
Well, you're not employing your pay. You're not paying your employees more. So I don't know why we're

10:04.820 --> 10:12.900
pretending the cost of living is a thing for these companies. I said also. You're doing your nails

10:12.900 --> 10:20.500
for the sweet eating stream. Yeah. How else are you gonna, you know, to my hands? You need to be

10:20.500 --> 10:25.620
able to imagine my hand wrapped around. And that's terrible. We're just started. I would do a lot of

10:25.620 --> 10:33.540
food filming. Oh my God, I'm rich. We're rich. I've got 25 coins. Are you squeezing me right now?

10:34.500 --> 10:39.220
Brian. You guys have been somnia said the Scottish madness streaming assassins creed

10:39.220 --> 10:45.300
for a combined 20 hours within the span of 36 hours. That's because I had problems sleeping.

10:45.300 --> 10:52.740
Thank you for the tip, Tharya. Oh my God. Right. So you can do voting like if you're like hardcore.

10:52.740 --> 10:56.820
Well, it's not really actually, but it's actually quite quick to get that. Oh, I've just skipped

10:56.820 --> 11:03.300
past the bit that tells you. Oh, what should we vote on? Should fire light a new level 77 demon

11:03.940 --> 11:11.780
bro. I have not. Whoa. These are like the same question, but different. I have not.

11:11.780 --> 11:17.060
I have not played enough runescape. I'm like the basic runescape for it. Okay. Before you think

11:17.060 --> 11:23.700
I'm going to start getting prayer pots out, I'm going to start a what is it called like pk in.

11:23.700 --> 11:29.940
No, I'm not pk in. I'm not doing that. I'm not happening. No, I'm called Scottish. I've got

11:29.940 --> 11:35.380
membership 30 days left. Oh, no, you can't see it because I'm a big ass. Hey, I'm grabbing the view.

11:36.820 --> 11:42.500
What world? Okay. Worlds can hold 2000 members. Okay. We're very lucky, but I don't think there's

11:42.500 --> 11:48.580
2000 recently available to stream snip. So the good thing, oh God, it's probably a bit too heavy.

11:49.140 --> 11:53.220
Please don't show my email and password. That would kind of suck. But then again, let's just throw

11:54.180 --> 12:00.580
this on the way to victory to victory to victory. I'm on the way to victory. So into the church,

12:00.580 --> 12:10.340
I go. Hello, Mr. Hello, Mr. Brace. Any bracers was pking player killing. It's when you attack

12:10.340 --> 12:15.940
players and you sell the goods that they drop basically. But before anyone thinks I'm going

12:15.940 --> 12:22.580
to turn into a pk. Yeah, good luck, mate. That's what happens. I'm doing this tutorial right now.

12:24.180 --> 12:29.460
I'm going to eat my food outside a lumbridge so everyone can get a chance to group up if you

12:29.460 --> 12:33.620
want to start on a new count of Hingo questing together. So please don't panic. If you think,

12:33.620 --> 12:38.820
like, oh, no, I'm not going to have enough time to join in, you absolutely do. I am going to

12:40.100 --> 12:46.500
make it so I eat my foodies. I've got a cola and two bottles of water with me.

12:47.460 --> 12:53.220
Um, as for those of you interested is if this is a and

13:00.260 --> 13:03.140
Oh, where the heck am I supposed to go? It's not blinking anything.

13:05.380 --> 13:09.060
Grabbing the boo. You will be shown how to cast spells when you get there. Just talk to the

13:09.060 --> 13:15.140
magic and assume you can hear them. Oh, of course it pops up. What are we doing? I'll hop on.

13:15.860 --> 13:19.060
We're going to just do basic questing because I've started a fresh account

13:19.620 --> 13:26.980
and we're going to try and get 99 Kooten. However, open up your final menu. Ah, am I done?

13:27.860 --> 13:32.340
Okay, not yet. We're about to teleport to Lummi and then I'll pick a free to play server.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.780
And oh my god, I'm casting the chicken.

13:38.340 --> 13:42.420
You wouldn't cast the chicken, would you? Would you? Who goes there?

13:42.900 --> 13:46.340
Everyone has someone you trust to lure into the world.

13:47.540 --> 13:53.380
Can I? I'm so sorry, but I'm going to confess my biggest sin and you guys honestly aren't ready

13:53.380 --> 14:00.020
for it. I used to be double in money and take people's money. The biggest amount I ever took

14:00.020 --> 14:07.060
was 100 K gold and then I stopped. I don't know how I didn't get banned. I think because I did it

14:07.060 --> 14:16.500
in such low increments. Send me to the mainland. I was so sorry. I used to be the one at the

14:16.500 --> 14:22.180
Grand Exchange. I was like a little kid because what happened was I got freaking scammed. He's

14:22.180 --> 14:28.980
got a fish. Come over here, adventurer John. I got scammed and then I realized, wait, I can just

14:28.980 --> 14:35.380
scam other people to get my money back. Doubling gold, doubling gold. And I'm like, I got all the

14:35.380 --> 14:41.620
money I lost back. It's time. Officers, it's her. Literally, I was like a little nine-year-old hustler.

14:42.980 --> 14:47.860
Like, oh, it's terrible. So if you ever got done at the Grand Exchange because you were a silly,

14:47.860 --> 14:54.100
silly McGee, guess what? It was probably me. We're going to hang out at this fountain at

14:54.100 --> 15:00.020
Lummi Castle right here. We're going to hang out at the little fountain. I am going to Swap World.

15:00.020 --> 15:04.580
Wait, why is it flashing? It might be flashing. Right, what world are we going to go to?

15:05.780 --> 15:16.420
I'll make it a free-to-play world. Whoa. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I think World Shifter's up here.

15:16.420 --> 15:24.180
Okay, um, free-to-play trade. No, it's got 900 people in it already. Do we want free-to-play trade?

15:25.140 --> 15:32.100
There's 900 people in it. Jagex is watching you now. They better not be. I'm in trouble.

15:32.100 --> 15:37.460
We're going to hang out at Lumbridge Castle for until I've finished my dinner and I'm trying to

15:37.460 --> 15:43.940
eat it on my breakfast. What world do we want? Free-to-play is good. Right, we'll just do the

15:43.940 --> 15:50.500
classic free-to-play trade-free world 301. There's 900 folk in it, so we've got all the room in the

15:50.500 --> 15:57.940
world. Take me, are you sure you wish to go to World 301? Yes, sir. Let's cycle.

16:02.900 --> 16:07.620
Okay, I don't know where the heck the reef ones are, so we'll come a little over to the fountain.

16:10.100 --> 16:16.180
Oh no, what are they use? I don't know. We might need to, I don't know, I think publish out.

16:16.980 --> 16:22.020
I don't want, are these reeflings in game? Wait, wait, wait, we're going to go over to the tree

16:22.020 --> 16:30.340
to make sure these are reeflings. Holy crap, are they? Brian! Good evening, Strony and reeflings,

16:30.340 --> 16:36.100
have fun on the RuneScape grind. Evening Alessandro, thank you for the tip. Oh my god, they're reeflings!

16:36.980 --> 16:42.020
Oh my god, who are you? Oh, you're looking at, oh my god, wait, you guys are actual, some of

16:42.020 --> 16:48.820
your actual players though. Oh, why are you so high level? Oh, oh, someone's called Tiny Cuttles,

16:48.820 --> 16:55.780
that's funny. Wait, you guys are like actual, I missed one, that was such a good name. Oh my god,

16:55.780 --> 17:02.020
just yummy. Hello, hello. Oh my god, you guys are like actual skillers and stuff.

17:03.700 --> 17:09.460
Good morning, reeflings, they're saying, oh, that's crazy. Strony's surprised to chat our gamers.

17:09.460 --> 17:13.860
I don't, but I didn't know if you guys were going, oh my god, you stole my drip,

17:13.860 --> 17:21.140
you look like me. Oh, you guys, you get stood on. I see a Strony. You guys are like so high level,

17:21.140 --> 17:26.660
that's amazing. You guys should probably teach me how to play the game. Unfortunately, we can't,

17:26.660 --> 17:34.020
what is that? Why is he standing like that? What does it mean? Am I to rate him like a pony?

17:34.100 --> 17:42.820
Oh, the guy's got the magma cape. I've never done the magma cape before. I have a stupid snowflake

17:42.820 --> 17:50.420
account, so I won't join. What does that mean? I have a snowflake account. Steals her legs,

17:50.420 --> 17:56.660
snowflake by the way. What does that mean? Oh my god, look at your fit, your fit's so unique.

17:56.660 --> 18:04.260
You're holding a puppy, and you've got like little things going on on you. Right, a lot of

18:04.260 --> 18:14.500
your like, over leveled like heck, what is this in his hand? Is that me in his hand? Oh, why is

18:14.500 --> 18:24.020
your name that? Oh no, why would you rename yourself? Oh no. Check or treat, let me type.

18:24.660 --> 18:32.340
Treat. I don't think I get, we want to see what you got, Sans. Shows what you got was to eat my

18:32.340 --> 18:38.420
dinner. Where did he go? Wait, did he just disappear because I looked down for one second?

18:38.420 --> 18:42.420
It says you guys want to trade me, but I don't think I can trade because I'm a new account.

18:43.460 --> 18:48.100
I don't think it works. I think I need to go quest and to like unlock trade if you guys

18:48.420 --> 18:53.540
want to give me anything. Is it in the stream to treat? Yeah, like I don't think you guys can

18:53.540 --> 19:03.060
trade me anything. So don't worry, we're gonna go quest them. RIP, yeah. Wait, I'm getting the fish.

19:03.060 --> 19:09.220
There's so many replays. Hello replays. Thank you everyone that can join. Hey, yo,

19:09.220 --> 19:19.220
we're deforestation out here. Oh, they leveled up. Let's go. Okay. Trick it is, geez. Yeah, look,

19:19.220 --> 19:25.220
accept trade. I don't think you can trade because I'm a new, new, new account. What? Are you giving me

19:26.900 --> 19:32.740
a rope and a fish? Are you telling me? Are you doing that? Should you be tweeting? No way,

19:32.740 --> 19:37.060
you could trade that. No way, I have a freaking rope in my inventory right now.

19:39.700 --> 19:44.740
Wait, can you only give me like World 301? Yeah, this world is full sad. Why?

19:46.500 --> 19:52.420
Oh, the world is full? Okay, wait, wait, hold on. Right, we're gonna move to,

19:53.380 --> 19:59.380
we're not doing, I don't know what these are. The regular bought items can't be traded. Okay,

19:59.380 --> 20:02.980
we're learning. Right, the world is full, so we're gonna go to an emptier one.

20:03.700 --> 20:07.860
Everyone get ready. High risk world. Yeah, no, thanks. Have a bow.

20:10.180 --> 20:12.340
Is there like a really easy one we can get inside?

20:13.940 --> 20:19.460
Clan Wars? I don't know. Do we get grouped on? Are we technically a clan? No.

20:23.220 --> 20:26.420
These are just dead Oz servers, apparently. Are these American?

20:27.380 --> 20:35.380
380, someone says 380. Hold on, 380, 380. Right, World 380. And we're going to Brit Bungland.

20:36.020 --> 20:42.180
Right, let's go 380. World 380. Wait, I'm double clicking. Let me go. 380.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.980
Grand exchanges limited to until you do quests or play for a while. Yeah.

20:48.260 --> 20:54.980
Now you have, now you have a fish. You're canonically strong. Okay, okay. Oh, look at everything.

20:56.980 --> 21:02.820
Okay, World 380. How do you dance? Oh my God, it's been so long. How do you dance? I want to dance too.

21:07.700 --> 21:12.340
I can dance. I'm sure I can dance. Hold on. Hey, let's go. Hey, grind. Oh, you know,

21:13.380 --> 21:18.580
we'll dance. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, man. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. What, what, what?

21:18.980 --> 21:23.220
Oh, I'm, I'm stunning on them. I'm stunning on them. Look at them dance. Whoa, what the,

21:23.940 --> 21:28.980
what in the pivot axis was that? That was awful. Don't ever do that again. Right, we're clapping.

21:32.660 --> 21:38.420
Okay, now that's honestly grand exchanges limited to. That's not a clan. That's an army. Oh, yeah.

21:38.420 --> 21:43.220
We'll be, we'll be do the refland clan and we'll go PK and like other clans or something. As if I

21:43.220 --> 21:49.700
know how the combat works. This, this only world where the text matters is PvP, high risk, total and

21:49.700 --> 21:57.300
demo. Right, are we ready to do the first official quest or I say that as if I've even hardly eaten

21:57.300 --> 22:04.420
any of my dinner. Hold on. I'm trying to eat, but I'm such a blabbermouth. Honestly, I can't stop.

22:05.060 --> 22:09.300
I'm glad the refunds aren't stacking in the one space. I strongly can appreciate them each. Yeah.

22:10.100 --> 22:17.460
Hmm. I was still, I'm convinced that guy wants me to write them because he's like a horse, literally.

22:21.220 --> 22:26.580
I'm so cute. Still got people doing tutorial. Yeah. Don't worry if you're still doing tutorial island.

22:26.580 --> 22:31.380
I'm going to inhale my dinner really quickly. I'm going to try my best. What is that noise?

22:31.940 --> 22:39.860
You're all making noises. I'm driving the booze. I'm still trying to log in.

22:43.140 --> 22:49.060
You're not giving people time to do the tutorial. Only the players play some of their games.

22:49.060 --> 22:54.660
How many are there? Oh my god. Oh, that's just an NBC hand. Oh, someone just leveled up.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.860
Look at her high level you guys are.

22:58.660 --> 23:00.900
I literally got the pepper, the frog over there.

23:02.820 --> 23:07.060
I love mommy. Oh my god.

23:12.260 --> 23:15.540
You guys are like actual gamers. Oh my god. It's much better than me.

23:15.540 --> 23:18.900
I'm like scared to play the game and I'm like, you guys are all going to show me out.

23:20.580 --> 23:25.540
Quality players determined by their agility and rune crafting level. Yeah. Yeah. No one likes

23:25.540 --> 23:30.580
rune crafting. You're not selling it here. Get your propagandas useless out of here because you're

23:30.580 --> 23:37.700
not rune crafting is the worst. Unless you literally have an entire army behind you to help.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.340
At the end of the stream, you'll be that high level. I think not.

23:47.300 --> 23:54.820
Yeah. Agility 89. You're really good at going in a circle then.

23:54.820 --> 24:03.940
Jeez. My brother was a Rinscape essence slaver for years. Do you pay to like carry the thing?

24:04.500 --> 24:08.900
Just don't please tell me. Banks are for squares. Are you an iron man?

24:09.860 --> 24:15.300
Oh, so there's different types of players you can be. If you're iron man,

24:15.300 --> 24:19.060
it means you don't have access to bank or something like that.

24:20.340 --> 24:23.780
Guardians of the Rift is experience. It's awesome experience.

24:25.140 --> 24:30.340
So will this be a 28 hour marathon? No, no, I don't think it's a marathon. I said yesterday,

24:30.340 --> 24:34.260
I thought it was a marathon, but I woke up and I don't actually feel that well today.

24:34.260 --> 24:37.700
I can't believe it. I can't believe streaming for 12 hours making me feel a bit wonky,

24:37.700 --> 24:42.500
but I don't know why because essentially I would sit at the PC and work on like

24:42.500 --> 24:46.580
Eden for like ASMR or something like that. But why is it when a streamer feels sick?

24:46.580 --> 24:49.780
Like it doesn't make sense. Feel weekend stream height, honestly.

24:51.220 --> 24:58.180
Free cuttlefish mustache right here. That's awful. Oh, how did you...

24:59.780 --> 25:06.180
What? Are you just cuttlefish right in front of us? I didn't know Rinscape had emotes like this.

25:07.700 --> 25:10.900
More active for streaming. Maybe because you did it three times this week.

25:10.900 --> 25:14.980
Me? Isn't every strong stream technically a marathon, honestly?

25:14.980 --> 25:19.780
Damn, how does one become an essence run slave? That's good money for that, I worry.

25:19.780 --> 25:22.900
The members emotes go hard. Strong party. Heck yeah.

25:23.700 --> 25:30.980
There's so many reflings. The servers are like who on earth are all these people? D-Refling.

25:32.820 --> 25:37.300
I'll read out your name if it's refling related, but I'll try not to accidentally say anything.

25:37.300 --> 25:42.020
Who is leveling up there? Freakin... I can hear someone leveling up, but it's always going...

25:44.180 --> 25:50.500
Hello? Jack the Ripper's coming to get us lads we're done for. Maybe it was your screaming

25:50.500 --> 25:56.900
yesterday, bro. I was so annoyed. I listened back. I didn't realise how angry I got. Like I got angry.

26:01.460 --> 26:05.220
It's a scale cape or more? Oh my god, he's got the fishing scale cape.

26:07.540 --> 26:14.820
Oh, je comprends, je comprends, wee wee. What is this freaking UFO over here? What is that?

26:14.820 --> 26:21.620
Oh, is that prey? Is that questing? You've done all quests. Oh, you've got all the jelly.

26:22.820 --> 26:29.060
Oh my god. Wait, what's the cooking one? Does anyone have 99 cookies? What's the cooking of more?

26:29.060 --> 26:30.180
I can't wait to get it.

26:30.580 --> 26:37.780
Oh, look at us all. Well, bing-ching-ing, d'enjouement, bing-ching-ing.

26:39.140 --> 26:45.700
How do I change servers? I'm on the runelight, so it's plug-in, so it's up here,

26:45.700 --> 26:55.620
but if you're not on the runelight plug-in, it's down the bottom somewhere. Smile.

26:55.620 --> 27:03.140
It's on the cog, I think. I have two baked potatoes. I've not even finished the first one,

27:03.140 --> 27:09.540
and it's freaking totey. Like it's so small. I'm trying so I can't eat and talk and be entertained

27:09.540 --> 27:16.020
at the same time. Quest cape, quest cape. Ah. Max cape is shaming us all. Click the top right

27:16.020 --> 27:22.500
X, then you'll see worlds switcher on the bottom. The door icon to hop worlds is what they're saying.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.420
Refillings are so MLG pro, honestly. Like, we're not even gaking them.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.820
Oh, you're so green. This refillings, like, literally so green.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.980
That's amazing. Maybe we should...

27:36.020 --> 27:41.460
Amala to tell us to all go buy green capes for scrawny. And then we all just walk around

27:41.460 --> 27:44.420
with green capes, and like whenever we pass someone, they'll be like,

27:44.420 --> 27:48.660
huh, what's going on over there? Why are they all doing their thing?

27:48.900 --> 27:55.860
Wishes to trade with you, so I can't accept anything outside of, like, regular trades.

27:58.340 --> 28:11.620
You get... you're giving me your Krusty cum sock. No! No way! I have a Krusty cum sock in my inventory.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.340
How did you even get that?

28:18.980 --> 28:26.420
All right. Gently used. Literally gently used. Right. I'm gonna eat. I'm gonna save maybe a

28:26.420 --> 28:30.340
five minute countdown, and then we're gonna start with Cook's insistent, and we'll take it from there.

28:30.340 --> 28:42.980
So for those of you who haven't made an account, we are on World 380. And we're outside Lung Bridge

28:42.980 --> 28:46.820
Castle. When you spawn in, we are literally just... you'll spawn in this way, and you've got...

28:46.820 --> 28:49.940
we're the left of the castle. We're just hanging out here, because we don't want to bother anyone

28:49.940 --> 28:54.900
that might be spawning in over here. But scrawny, the character has pink hair. Or am I seeing pink?

28:54.900 --> 28:57.220
Main has ginger hair. Like, I'm a junior.

28:59.380 --> 29:04.500
Which thing? And then I've got green top, and then pink, uh, thingy. Prepared to get...

29:04.500 --> 29:05.620
Billied nerds!

29:11.540 --> 29:14.660
I'm trying to eat so fast. It's hard, honestly.

29:16.660 --> 29:21.060
But I hope you guys have got hydration and eating. I don't know if it's an endurance stream yet.

29:21.060 --> 29:24.020
Okay, but I have.

29:24.020 --> 29:33.780
Ginger hair, cute outfit, and a rope. Yeah, yeah. You can get me.

29:34.660 --> 29:39.460
380, yeah, 380. The refling in the game, of course, is gonna be...

29:39.460 --> 29:41.140
Don't stop until you get 99.

29:41.140 --> 29:45.380
Bro, you think I can stream until 99, Cookin'? I don't even know how to, like,

29:45.380 --> 29:51.380
maximise Cookin'. The closest I ever got was, like, 80, but I'd rather do it live with you guys.

29:52.340 --> 29:58.580
Buying girlfriend 50 gold. What happened to party hats? I remember people were, like,

29:58.580 --> 30:02.980
renting party hats in quotation marks. I don't know what that means at all.

30:12.980 --> 30:18.900
Delicious coke. I say delicious as if it's just not a regular fizzy juice.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.860
Well, actually, it's, like, one of the most popular fizzy juices, so...

30:25.620 --> 30:29.700
They decided not to have exclusive one-time items. Oh, even though they're tradable?

30:30.900 --> 30:34.100
I guess they didn't, like, give enough out? Possible?

30:35.380 --> 30:38.900
They can... they became common. Oh! They made it common.

30:41.460 --> 30:45.220
You go to a good place for Cookin', and you cook till the number says 99,

30:45.220 --> 30:49.700
or you run out of money with some of the fish. Okay, you're done.

30:51.380 --> 30:53.940
Oh, people are getting, uh, minigames.

30:56.500 --> 31:02.580
I was, like, I'm saying, come along with me, Miss... I miss Fauna. Wacky wacky, I miss Fauna.

31:07.700 --> 31:14.580
Max Capers. How much playtime? 232 days says one. 314 says another.

31:16.180 --> 31:19.540
I can't believe my little... my little reeflings are adorable little nerds!

31:19.540 --> 31:23.540
I can't believe it! You can do just a feckin' adorable! Yeah, you like ringskates.

31:25.540 --> 31:28.820
That's so precious. I'm glad you found a game that you really enjoy and can, uh,

31:28.820 --> 31:32.420
throw yourself inside. It's... when you find that game, it's really nice.

31:33.220 --> 31:34.980
Anyway, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, let's get started.

31:35.060 --> 31:35.560
Okay.

31:41.140 --> 31:45.220
Yesterday, Avatar, No Capitalist Simulator. This is all really a trust.

31:46.420 --> 31:51.380
Someone says 63 days, and I haven't even left this area.

31:52.500 --> 32:00.820
Uh, someone says 1650 hours for a total of 1,800... I can't read numbers.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.100
Big number. Big hours for big number. Thank you.

32:04.980 --> 32:06.980
Hmm.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.660
Oh, more reeflings?

32:13.380 --> 32:17.220
Have we got more reeflings joining us? Yeah. Someone's got... oh, someone literally

32:17.220 --> 32:18.020
is called Sway Sok.

32:21.140 --> 32:26.020
A snowflake among snowflakes. Wait, what am I missing? What is this? Is this like super

32:26.020 --> 32:33.220
RuneScape terms I don't know about yet? Or is this literally, uh, take the word heart

32:33.220 --> 32:37.940
and remove the H and replace... remove the H and E and replace it with an F.

32:37.940 --> 32:42.100
Relax. Snowflake is called Dark Humour. Is that the joke or am I missing that one?

32:43.300 --> 32:44.660
Respect for the Iron Man.

32:46.340 --> 32:51.060
Snowflake accounts are accounts that have extremely restrictive stipulations.

32:51.060 --> 32:56.260
What does that even mean? You've somehow... you can't... Snowflake is a special account.

32:58.180 --> 33:00.740
Wait, the Venezuelans are the snowflakes?

33:03.220 --> 33:06.420
Game is not DJing enough. We need to make it harder. What the heck?

33:13.220 --> 33:17.620
I think the skull and crossbones means this guy's a p-care over here. I'm okay.

33:18.980 --> 33:20.740
Can only do content in a region.

33:23.220 --> 33:29.700
Jeez. One guy's playing the game where if he takes damage, all... Oh, I know!

33:30.340 --> 33:37.220
Uh, the Swamplatex guy. Yeah. I've not actually watched that series.

33:37.220 --> 33:43.300
The No Hits run series, but yeah. Region locked. Oh, settled. That's his name, not Swamplatex.

33:45.940 --> 33:49.860
I have still not finished the first fucking potato. I'm actually getting annoyed now.

33:49.860 --> 33:52.340
Why is the food not getting away off my plate?

33:55.940 --> 33:59.140
I'm inhaling it. I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna have to send it.

34:00.020 --> 34:03.620
I can't. I'm getting too distracted trying to, like, talk into the...

34:03.620 --> 34:07.140
I'm sending it. This is the fastest freaking eating you'll ever hear of me.

34:11.540 --> 34:14.340
I've caught another bit of potato. I've never done this.

34:14.980 --> 34:18.260
And, um... Okay, I've had enough of eating. I'm already bored of it.

34:20.580 --> 34:24.180
I should weigh myself, honestly, just so I don't lose too much weight.

34:24.180 --> 34:27.940
Because I stream too much. I was actually wondering about that because I've not had a proper meal.

34:28.660 --> 34:32.020
I'm, like, ages out. I'll cut, I'll cut, I'll cut. Done.

34:32.660 --> 34:39.460
I can't give life of a fucking plate. I've tried to eat it. It's taken too long. Right.

34:43.460 --> 34:48.660
Okay. I was trying to eat a baked potato in prawns, and it was just taken forever.

34:50.260 --> 34:54.260
Oh, I've had enough. Right. Is this everyone who wants to show up?

34:54.980 --> 35:00.180
Can chat, talk to me, and tell me, is everyone here that wants to be here?

35:01.780 --> 35:03.940
Talking with your mouth full, ASMR is trying to really...

35:03.940 --> 35:08.980
It's fine. It's stop. If that counts as ASMR, then I've got a ton of content for you.

35:09.860 --> 35:14.740
Okay. Is everyone who wants to be questing, is in the game right now?

35:14.740 --> 35:17.220
Is anyone in Tutorial Island? Someone says they're late.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.380
Okay, we'll wait. We'll wait. We'll get a few more minutes.

35:19.940 --> 35:24.020
Right. If we've got a few more minutes, it's time to start telling jokes.

35:25.220 --> 35:32.820
Why did Ernest the Chicken cross the road to get to the other side?

35:36.580 --> 35:40.100
Oh, thank you. Thank you. If you didn't know, there's a quest called Ernest the Chicken. Thank you.

35:42.820 --> 35:48.660
I feel your pain. Yes. Do re-log in on your questing account to render the other side.

35:49.540 --> 35:58.100
I'm here. I've never opened this game before. Okay. We'll stand outside the castle this time.

35:58.100 --> 36:00.100
We're just going to be right outside the castle.

36:02.660 --> 36:06.260
If you want to start on a new quest on the account just to have the shiz and giggles,

36:06.260 --> 36:10.420
we are going to do a main quest. Oh my god, there's so many reflings.

36:10.420 --> 36:16.500
Like, oh, it's over. Thank you so much for joining me and being the law. I'm like so fucking happy.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.860
Like, I don't realize I'm like, oh my god, that's a lot of this playing.

36:22.580 --> 36:29.540
Right. Don't forget the riveting tail of lily pad labor dispute, honestly. I'm done for some shingles.

36:29.540 --> 36:37.460
Okay. Why is his name Ernest? I honestly didn't know. I can't even remember. I hardly remember.

36:37.460 --> 36:43.700
I'm here, but I've never opened this game before. What world? I am on world 388.

36:43.780 --> 36:50.420
Um, the mods have pinning. Can mods pin world 388?

36:53.780 --> 37:00.420
Free questing. I might work some unable to participate, but have fun surrounding reflings.

37:00.420 --> 37:08.420
Oh, thank you. We will. We will. I don't think mods can pin. Okay. Can I pin? Can I pin? Hold on.

37:08.980 --> 37:14.980
Ow, I don't know. Where's YouTube? Can you open up one stream? Strony cartels.

37:14.980 --> 37:21.140
Tape it in. Oh, I'm live. I'm live right now. Tape it in. Oh my gosh, I'm live right now.

37:21.780 --> 37:23.860
Pin message. There we go.

37:27.540 --> 37:30.740
Strony, after the bloke completion, what do you think about the bad jokes

37:30.740 --> 37:36.420

37:36.420 --> 37:41.940

Put it away, put it away, put it away. Level one cooking. Level nine, nine cooking. Here we go.

38:26.100 --> 38:27.700

38:41.380 --> 38:45.780
First quest. Open up our little quest adventure menu where the heck is that? I can't see because

38:45.780 --> 38:52.980
iPhone's in the way. Excuse me, iPhone. I'm here to do something. Right, the quest is called

38:53.300 --> 39:00.100
Cook's Assistant. Oh, oh, here it is. I'll read it out for you as for those who use it

39:00.100 --> 39:06.500
are blind. Cook's Assistant. I can start this quest by talking to the Cook Lumberge Castle.

39:06.500 --> 39:15.620
Difficulty, novice. Very short. Release 2001. Jeez. Storyline. Stand alone. No requirements

39:15.620 --> 39:21.220
and no, no. Wait, someone else wishes to trade. I don't, you guys can't give me like main stuff,

39:21.220 --> 39:26.980
I am. I'm gonna head to bed early and I'll use the stream as a sleep bed. I hope I don't wake you.

39:26.980 --> 39:34.260
No way, I've got a penny. No, I have a penny as well. Oh my god. Wait, wait, sorry. Hold on.

39:34.260 --> 39:41.780
Sorry, camera angle. Oh my god. I'm a real freaking woman. Oh, let's go. I look so good.

39:41.780 --> 39:46.740
Thank you for the penny. Thank you for the chess hat. If you want to gift you games,

39:46.740 --> 39:54.900
how do we do that? You don't. I buy them with my hard earned cash. Cold hard cash. Right,

39:54.900 --> 40:01.620
let's go Cook's Assistant. I'll turn off running. We'll just walk. Right, you ready? Oh, Lumberge

40:01.620 --> 40:07.060
Castle, do you mind? I don't want to. Come, reflings. You can follow me if you want. Ah,

40:07.060 --> 40:11.860
wait, who are we fighting? Why are you fighting that per man? Right, oh my god, women's simulator.

40:11.860 --> 40:21.140
Time to head to the kitchen. Oh my god, there's so many of them. Right, this Cook is like,

40:21.140 --> 40:29.060
why are all you people in my kitchen right now? All right, yes, Cook. What's wrong, Mr. Cook?

40:30.020 --> 40:35.860
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I'm in terrible trouble with Miss. It's the Duke's birthday the day

40:35.860 --> 40:40.580
and I should be making him a big, lovely birthday cake. I've forgotten to buy the ingredients.

40:40.580 --> 40:44.900
I'll never get them now. He'll sack me. What will I do? I have four children and I go

40:44.900 --> 40:52.500
to look after. Honestly, me with the... What? I have five babies, but one of them is a goat.

40:52.500 --> 40:58.100
He has four babies and a goat. What are the odds? Yes, we're going to help Cook's Assistant. Yes,

40:58.100 --> 41:04.980
I'll help you. Oh great. Oh, my little quest helper just popped up. Where do I find these

41:04.980 --> 41:11.380
ingredients? Uh, I think I remember where they are, so I think we can just walk away.

41:11.380 --> 41:16.500
Do I need to pick up a pit? I think... Do we need this jug? Wait, are we all going to be fighting

41:16.500 --> 41:24.100
over the same jug? Do we not need a jug for this quest to put the milk in? Save yourself and run,

41:24.100 --> 41:32.340
buy eggs here. 100 cold coins, sell an egg. No, do we not have to pick up the big egg and like the

41:32.340 --> 41:37.940
milk from the dairy? Oh, am I going crazy? Isn't that like one special big egg and one special?

41:40.180 --> 41:42.260
I've got 25, best I can offer. Real cheap.

41:43.940 --> 41:49.460
People are thinking you are doing a drop party or something. All the folk following. Oh, no idea.

41:50.500 --> 41:57.460
I'm like, yo, you guys have money? I can go get some jugs and drop them. Man's running a scheme. I

41:57.460 --> 42:06.820
respect it, honestly. Are you guys grabbing all his equipment? Okay, right. We can take off and

42:06.820 --> 42:10.900
get the egg, so we'll go to the front of the castello. If everyone has accepted that quest,

42:11.620 --> 42:18.420
we'll go to the front. I think they changed it. Okay, right. Oh, no. It does look like we're a drop

42:18.420 --> 42:25.220
party. I'm broke, so I can't afford any eggs. Don't worry, I'm going to take you to the egg factory.

42:25.220 --> 42:31.940
It's me. Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop, plop. Okay. Oh my God, we like a drop party so badly.

42:33.540 --> 42:39.700
Right, I'm pretty sure you get eggs across the river. Chickens aren't going to stand a chance.

42:39.700 --> 42:46.260
Yeah, so the cow milk and the eggs are across the river. If you follow me, oh my God,

42:46.260 --> 42:51.060
strontilates eggs? I was going to do ovate deposit. I might even pretend otherwise.

42:51.940 --> 42:59.140
We call these people hurt in the jaw flings. We're going to milk a cow. Milk the cow.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.860
Milk the cow. We need it straight from the teeth, you know?

43:07.300 --> 43:13.380
A normal egg works just fine. Yes. Has YouTube ceased the culling? I think so.

43:13.380 --> 43:18.340
We actually are submitting for monetization today. Can I milk your cow or do I need a bucket?

43:18.340 --> 43:26.180
Oh, I milked it. But that's because I had a jug. Wait, did I milk it or am I going crazy?

43:28.820 --> 43:32.020
She goes, Teehee, you've never milked a cow before. How could you tell?

43:32.740 --> 43:36.180
Because you're spilling milk. What a waste. You need something to hold the milk. Oh,

43:37.780 --> 43:45.460
oh no. Oh no. Where'd you get a bucket in this game? Right, we'll go get the eggs then.

43:45.460 --> 43:49.780
Eggs first. We'll deal with a bucket problem in a minute. Buckets are from the tutorial.

43:49.780 --> 43:54.420
Worked for me. I don't have a bucket. Oh no, I already have a bucket of milk. What the heck?

43:54.420 --> 43:57.700
I already have a bucket. I've already got a bucket of milk in my inventory. I don't know why she

43:57.700 --> 44:04.100
said that to me. Cheeky rat, honestly. Right, egg time. Egg time. We go get the eggies.

44:04.100 --> 44:09.140
We go get the eggies. That's the only thing about the RuneScape plugin. I can see the price of

44:09.140 --> 44:14.980
everything. You guys want to watch me beat up a chicken? That's right. Violence! Violence!

44:14.980 --> 44:22.180
Rage against the machine. Oh, I just killed it with Kung Fu. That's right. And I know three

44:22.180 --> 44:26.020
other dangerous ones. I didn't drop an egg. All right, okay. Just let's all beat up the chickens

44:26.020 --> 44:32.260
and get eggs. Beat the chickens up. We're going to gang violence these chickens. Literally,

44:32.260 --> 44:37.620
the whole gang of us coming in. Someone's casting Shadow Wizard Money Gang. We love casting spells

44:37.620 --> 44:44.980
on egg chickens. Oh my god, there's like so much. It's just hard to see anything. Oh my god,

44:44.980 --> 44:48.900
I need to like zoom right in. Beat that chicken up. No, you stole my chicken. Wait, I'm going to take

44:48.900 --> 44:52.740
this egg. Right, I have an egg. I have an egg, so I'm going to stand here because I've got one. But

44:52.740 --> 44:58.100
make sure you get an egg before you move away from the section. Have a good day starting. I will.

44:59.700 --> 45:03.060
If you have an egg and you have milk, you're allowed to stand at the gate with me.

45:03.540 --> 45:13.540
Oh, be them. They're level one. Show them who's boss. The greatie, hidden the greatie.

45:13.540 --> 45:22.180

running some sort of like a factory or something is everyone got a bit of

48:37.260 --> 48:43.100
flour are we a wee bit of grain or wheat it does not look good that does not look

48:43.100 --> 48:49.220
good honestly instead of a like people are like no no reflect no no you know

48:49.220 --> 48:56.940
let's say I read that in game oh close the door on the reefing who did that

48:56.940 --> 49:02.980
right everyone climb the ladder we need to go up to the top we are not a cult we

49:02.980 --> 49:05.980
promise literally people thinking it's a drop party and we're all just like

49:05.980 --> 49:11.740
harvesting right drop your wheat into the hopper and then you pull on the lever

49:11.740 --> 49:20.900
at the top of this wait are we pulling it for each other okay I think that I

49:20.900 --> 49:28.300
think it's still instance yeah okay and then if we go down to the bottom yeah it's

49:28.340 --> 49:34.300
waiting for us and now we have everything we need wait wasn't the point to

49:34.300 --> 49:39.420
have an army of sleigh oh why do you walk like that that's actually really

49:39.420 --> 49:44.540
freaky I'm sorry but why do you walk like that honestly is that like a thing

49:44.540 --> 49:51.020
why do you walk like that oh that's so creepy I don't like it it feels like

49:51.020 --> 49:56.980
something that's changed like chasing yeah wrong lever crank how do you increase

49:56.980 --> 50:01.300
render distance I can't see anything I have no idea I'm using runelite plug-in

50:01.300 --> 50:09.980
so I can see like this far but I don't need to like focus on this really wait do

50:09.980 --> 50:18.420
we need to pay the sleigh to be slaves no we do it for free I think to the he

50:18.420 --> 50:23.820
wants you to mount him ah he's scary it's thanks to the banana they're wielding

50:23.860 --> 50:31.920
the banana makes your legs open up oh okay okay when I said it out loud it

50:31.920 --> 50:38.220
makes sense that his legs do that is everyone got their weight I think so

50:38.220 --> 50:45.100
there's slaves and then there's like I think everyone's got their weight just

50:45.100 --> 50:50.660
they make sure all the reeflings are following yeah okay we're gonna make it

50:50.660 --> 50:52.660

51:20.300 --> 51:26.980
my lore we are weed oh it's not another word that sounds the same we I'd like to

51:26.980 --> 51:32.140

51:32.620 --> 51:38.100

53:59.180 --> 54:03.020
terrible um actually I could talk about that the reason why the Welsh are

54:03.100 --> 54:07.740
associated with that because it uh it wasn't it's illegal to steal someone's sheep

54:07.740 --> 54:12.860
but it wasn't illegal at the time to mm-hmm a sheep I'll wait outside to get everyone all

54:14.140 --> 54:19.980
you need 23 inventory slots pause pause pause pause hold the line hold the line what's going on

54:19.980 --> 54:25.580
we need 20 inventory space right get to the top of that castle and shove everything in your bank

54:33.260 --> 54:38.460
now we are going to the bank if you check if you click on the quest the plug ensures you

54:38.460 --> 54:43.340

54:48.700 --> 54:55.340
everyone get to the bank and empty your inventory we need sheep shears for this quest so you can

54:55.420 --> 55:00.700

56:44.460 --> 56:50.060
cooking is I think it's sharks I want to say it's sharks but sharks are so expensive because

56:50.060 --> 56:55.580
they're hard to run okay let's make sure all the reeflings that I still tell terrifies me to this

56:55.580 --> 57:04.060

literally all of us are chasing these perches the sheep are like I've just grown that roots oh oh

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:19.500
and world wars literally forget like gilinor games forget winter is it hot winter taught or

something we're literally stream sniping sheep shearing no I can't wait for the cow grinding

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.900
honestly we'll probably need to get levels up together like so we're not like in danger of dying

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:38.780
stop you saved me I can't believe you freaking sniping these sheep per sheep were forced to be

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:46.700
stripped over no one who is perishing the sheep you don't need perishing to harvest the wool

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:52.620
the penguins are part of the fun members quest oh aren't they I didn't know that

01:02:53.900 --> 01:03:00.620

going to do full inventory I think get sniped get sniped I was before I was before I'm actually

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.180

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:27.100
sniped get sniped get sniped I got it get sniped literally I saw you I saw the way you were walking

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:33.180
over to that that sheep life is hard in runescape world honestly but wouldn't it be fun like this

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.300
is imagine if all you had to do was like shear sheep and then you get paid coins for at grand

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:43.740
exchange you can go like get food and stuff I'm actually camping the sheep right now I'm like

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:51.420

01:03:51.420 --> 01:04:02.300
have faith oh this oh I must have 20 no the refling one someone's already outside and you're outside

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.740

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:22.780

given an amulet make sure you put it on your person okay make sure you do not waste your sprint

01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:01.660
weaker leaflings because we need to run away like from this fight immediately two years without

01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:10.620
internet i'd be absolutely losing it i'm sorry i'd be i'd just are you squint me ryan hey stroney

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:29.260
leaflings coming here leafling you're so you're so behind i'm gonna have to i'll wait for them to

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:43.340
you for the tip and on if it's big i think paste bin is a safe website right let's get the heck out

01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:50.940
here for these rat scouts or the frogs at the swamp hey drony hi hi thanks for joining

01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:57.820
two years of isolation is wild literally like i'm sorry but if i was isolated i'd just straight up

01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:05.100
day and night no stop and say i'm sorry but i gotta do something to pass the time gotta do something

01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:11.580
to pass the time so i do not know how that brings anyone closer to meditation could a paceman link

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:18.860
work yeah i think paceman's probably the only thing right i think we need to be ready to run

01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:26.220
away so get ready to turn these running boots on okay but talk to the restless ghost hello ghost

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:33.820
how are you not very good actually what's the problem then did you just understand what i said

01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:39.500
yeah no tell me what the problem is whoa this is incredible i didn't even expect anyone to ever

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:45.980
understand me again okay okay i can understand you but do you have any idea why you're doomed to be a

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:53.340
ghost well to be honest i'm not sure i've been told a certain task may need to be completed

01:42:53.340 --> 01:43:01.100
so you can rest in peace i should think it is probably because a warlock has come along and

01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:07.740
stolen my skull if you look inside my coffin it's no they're i briefly just closed the coffin as soon

01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:16.460
as you said that okay okay he's missing his head we can see this in his head he clearly needs some

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:30.460
head oh yeah that would be such great relief okay return the ghosts skull where do we need

01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:36.700
what we need to go to the wizard's tower

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:49.660
what the hell i don't remember that no way i don't remember it's actually quite far away

01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:55.820
a reefing was to show me something what do you want to show me reefing other player has accepted

01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:03.100
oh you're giving me fish to cook wait you're giving me this now wait i think you might need

01:44:03.100 --> 01:44:09.340
to hold on to it because if i die in this quest you need to hold on to this okay hold on to it

01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:14.380
thank you but you need to hold on to that because if i die i'm gonna drop all of that we'll do a

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:18.700
few more quests and then we're gonna actually start leveling up cooking like for real for real okay

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:27.580
but thank you so much but do hold on to that because i'm gonna end up perishing looks in coffin

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:34.860

01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:09.260
i don't know this sounds like hide and seek i'd rather lose but every time i find you all you

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:17.180
hear is plop plop plop and then move on to the next refilling plop plop plop over okay uh we need

01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:22.380
to put the hedge on the coffin and all is good we're gonna use the skull on the coffin

01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:24.780
with use it on the car

01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:33.020
it's not uh it's not cool oh cutscene release thank you stranger

01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:42.700
oh he's away oh he's in the water oh he's having enough he's in the water

01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:48.220

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:51.580
points no jeez we got a name prayer

01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:58.140
what i didn't level four combat currently i didn't say anything though

01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:07.180
hide and plop oh yes hide and plop i want to hide and plop good release oh that's

01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:15.100
with a lot and everyone's leveling up um rep sleeping viewers yeah sorry hopefully no one

01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:23.740
actually uses this to sleep though um i wonder if there's also a kumburu uh right what's the

01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:28.700
easiest quest next or are we actually gonna have to level up i think we might have to get stronger

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:38.380
because everything's like um pirate maybe goblin village if we buy everything in advance for that

01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:45.660
goblin quest i forgot the name of it romeo and juliet is good should we try romeo and juliet

01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:55.180
romeo and juliet also an amniolet that's useful for the future right stronghold of security time

01:51:55.740 --> 01:52:01.180
i've never done that one romeo and juliet is no needed stats okay we're gonna do that one then

01:52:02.140 --> 01:52:07.100
i can start this quest by talking to romeo and varrock square where the heck

01:52:08.620 --> 01:52:16.940
oh that's a big walk not gonna lie that's like really far away not gonna lie okay we cross

01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:23.820
the bridge and then we just keep going all the way up to varrock i've already lost where romeo is

01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:28.860
oh he's literally in the square of varrock well we don't have teleport stone so we're gonna have

01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:40.300
to do it the old-fashioned way uh i heard it drops the goal in the amniolet i didn't know what that is

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:48.540
follow someone says follow just oh oh taxi okay follow the guy with the magma cape

01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:54.620
wait make sure we get out of the graveyard first because we might actually get stuck on the gravestones

01:52:54.620 --> 01:53:04.220
yeah you'll get careful you get stuck on the gravestones okay if you're gonna tax sales can i make

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:11.500
a cup of tea amniolet to make a cup of tea that little voice is getting for this is a magma cape

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:21.180
winky it is isn't it a magma cape whoa what is that wait you got a special accolade is that

01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:29.340
a special accolade to this thing oh it's a fire cape i mean it looks like magma lava so however

01:53:29.340 --> 01:53:38.940
named it is wrong we we must go directly into the dark mages oh wait i can't make a cup of tea

01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:44.300
because i'm gonna get hurt by the mages for the weaker reeflings we're about to pass some

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:50.540
wizards outside of a rock that will attack us we need to be ready to run

01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:55.500
go west near the farm oh so oh he says he's gonna go around

01:53:56.380 --> 01:54:01.020
i think we have enough people to kill the dark wizards oh can i go quickly make a cup of tea then

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:05.900
watching strony stream

01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:13.340
ah whenever i read the like last thingy you know the love heart you know he you can put a love heart

01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:19.340
on stream like that little tap that love heart thing it's in the way if i read the most bottom

01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:24.220
thing it says watching strony stream is the type of accolade yeah if you tap that heart i can see

01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:30.940
when you tap it but it blocks the last message i'll be doing nothing but laughing if anyone dies

01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:35.260
oh we'll also be at the bank so is that reeflings still there to trade the fish

01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:40.460
there's plenty more fish i can only see it on mobile yeah i can see someone make a flush like

01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:45.820
face smiley reaction it's in the way for everyone okay right i was gonna say because it's in the

01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:50.620
way whenever i read like the most bomb message it's in the way that cape requires you to kill a level

01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:55.740
700 monster like unless you guys can carry me through that monster i don't think we can do that

01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:01.180
i've never done it before yeah i had to nuke the heart with an edulander i think you can toggle

01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:07.100
away yeah i have to scroll around it it's a solo fight well i'm never getting that

01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:15.180
hmm i am here with the fish okay we will be going next to the bank so

01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:23.260
we should be okay i think is there any hopefully isn't too many oh yeah good idea to go to the

01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:28.460
bushes first oh no these reeflings oh no don't get stuck on the wall reefling

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:33.820
that these are reeflings oh no i don't know if that's everything i might just be someone

01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:39.020
there's three dots at the top of chat and no no i think it's okay i think it's there

01:55:41.180 --> 01:55:46.860
fire cape would be fun oh no i don't even know how to do that i don't even know how prayer pots work

01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:53.260
in like strength potions and all of that work and it's like all temporary but they're like a thousand

01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:54.540
and it's so expensive

01:55:55.420 --> 01:56:05.260
hmm watch out now all right weaker reeflings get ready get ready weaker reeflings stronger

01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:11.580
reeflings beat them up show those wizards we mean we mean freaking we mean business beat them up

01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:16.860
stronger reeflings will be the weaker reeflings are gonna stick together this is the best we

01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:18.380
can do under the circumstances

01:56:23.420 --> 01:56:28.300
run into the circle reefing no they're not going that circle these wizards are stinky

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:33.740
they're no good guys he's telling you fevers he's telling you the Fibonacci sequence because

01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:39.420
those are fevers okay i think the reeflings like literally eradicated all the wizards for us in

01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:45.980
the way thank you they're all dead literally just absolutely eradicated them i think the funniest

01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:54.300

02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:51.660
you strapped on the fence i'm sorry i was a bit i was a bit pre-emptive okay okay that was lucky

02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:58.060
easy take it easy easy let's not get any rieflings caught on a fence come on we can do it i have no

02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:04.140
idea how oh here's the church where's the church right we're gonna go to the steps over here rare

02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:10.140

02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:15.820
we should we do fisty cuffs should we do fisty cuffs in will they and just start beating each

02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:20.940
other up until there's like a crowned riefling at the end and then and then i give you a rose as a

02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:24.060
favor like because you're like the knight that stood against all rieflings

02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:33.660
and and looks are domain like the way for you uh i was in the middle of a ceremony but Romeo sent

02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:43.020
me but i'm busy delivering a ceremony to my congregation uh yes it certainly seems like

02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:49.820
you have a captive audience okay okay what do you want so i can get rid of you and continue

02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:55.820
with my ceremony Romeo sent me he says you've been able to help uh Romeo yes a fine land but he's a

02:15:55.820 --> 02:16:03.180
wee bit confused uh very confused anyway uh Romeo wishes to be married to Julia she must be rescued

02:16:03.180 --> 02:16:09.500
from her father's control i agree and i think having i do a potion to make her dad oh to appear

02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:16.140
passed away dead sounds a bit creepy to me but please continue the potion will only make Julia yet

02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:23.100
appear dead then she will be taken to the crypt crypt again we're getting a bit creepy may you

02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:30.380
must have some strange hobbies then Romeo can collect her from the crypt go to the apocryphae

02:16:30.380 --> 02:16:37.020
tell him i sent you and that you'll need cadaver potion that's what the berries someone gave me

02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:41.260
apart from did that riefling want me to be asleep or did you want to be asleep

02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:46.860

dead your still and lifeless corpse will be removed from the crypt oh a cold dark creepy crypt

02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:42.780

He goes, ah, I understand.

02:51:00.940 --> 02:51:02.460

Right, okay, take a little left outside the castle.

02:51:06.060 --> 02:51:07.460
Make sure all my beeflings are here.

02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:09.740
A little bit of a left.

02:51:09.740 --> 02:51:10.740
Don't work on me.

02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:11.740
Don't have a brain.

02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:12.740
Ah, bless you.

02:51:12.740 --> 02:51:13.740
Okay.

02:51:13.740 --> 02:51:15.740
Okay, please follow me, reeflings.

02:51:15.740 --> 02:51:17.740
I don't want to leave anyone behind.

02:51:17.740 --> 02:51:19.740
I want to make sure you're my reeflings.

02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:20.740
No.

02:51:20.740 --> 02:51:22.740
Okay, we are now going to go to the fishing spot

02:51:22.740 --> 02:51:24.740
that is past the graveyard.

02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:26.740
Not a cult if we're hypnotized maybe.

02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:27.740
Technically.

02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:28.740
Oh no, sorry.

02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:29.740
I lost some reeflings that we're following.

02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:32.740
Oh no, they're stuck behind at the church.

02:51:32.740 --> 02:51:34.740
I'm so sorry.

02:51:34.740 --> 02:51:35.740
Okay.

02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:38.740
Everyone, get to the fishing spot over here.

02:51:38.740 --> 02:51:41.740
This is where I used to fish as a child.

02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:42.740
Mama and her ducklings.

02:51:42.740 --> 02:51:43.740
Main break.

02:51:43.740 --> 02:51:44.740
We're good.

02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:45.740
Yeah.

02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:46.740
And then look.

02:51:46.740 --> 02:51:48.740
Wait, these reeflings?

02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:49.740
No.

02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:50.740
Maybe?

02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:51.740
Not really.

02:51:51.740 --> 02:51:52.740
But we can fish.

02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:54.740
Everyone can fish on the same tail.

02:51:54.740 --> 02:51:55.740
It doesn't make a difference.

02:51:55.740 --> 02:51:57.740
How many bots we got?

02:51:57.740 --> 02:51:58.740
Oh, these botters.

02:51:58.740 --> 02:51:59.740
You can bought a shrimp.

02:51:59.740 --> 02:52:01.740
Who's buying shrimp for hell?

02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:03.740
I'm starting leading the reefling around

02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:05.740
like a big school field trip.

02:52:05.740 --> 02:52:08.740
We're all individuals.

02:52:08.740 --> 02:52:09.740
Yeah.

02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:14.740
We're going to fish and then we're going to get

02:52:14.740 --> 02:52:16.740
like cooking level.

02:52:16.740 --> 02:52:19.740
What is happening?

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:20.740
Beep, beep.

02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:21.740
It does not compute.

02:52:21.740 --> 02:52:23.740
One-o-one-o-one-o-one-o-one.

02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:25.740
We're pretending we're bots.

02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:30.740
Oh, are we such trolls?

02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:32.740
Shrimp locked hardcore.

02:52:32.740 --> 02:52:36.740
3VP bronze man market sunk by bots.

02:52:36.740 --> 02:52:39.740
This is going to be fun to do without access to my bank.

02:52:39.740 --> 02:52:40.740
Oh, no.

02:52:40.740 --> 02:52:42.740
I don't even thought.

02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:44.740
Hello, fellow human.

02:52:44.740 --> 02:52:46.740
Hello, fellow flesh humans.

02:52:46.740 --> 02:52:48.740
How are you doing?

02:52:48.740 --> 02:52:52.740
Fish, shrimp, cook, many, big level, cook, keep, get.

02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:53.740
Yes.

02:52:53.740 --> 02:52:54.740
That's a plan.

02:52:54.740 --> 02:52:56.740
So we're just starting with this.

02:52:56.740 --> 02:52:58.740
Everything that lives is designed to end world trap.

02:52:58.740 --> 02:52:59.740
What?

02:52:59.740 --> 02:53:00.740
Is that reeflings doing that?

02:53:00.740 --> 02:53:01.740
Oh, my God.

02:53:01.740 --> 02:53:04.740
The bot just ran off.

02:53:04.740 --> 02:53:06.740
So we're going to fish until our inventory is full

02:53:06.740 --> 02:53:08.740
and then I'm going to chop down one of those trees

02:53:08.740 --> 02:53:10.740
and we're all going to cook around the fire together

02:53:10.740 --> 02:53:14.740
and we're all going to share little stories when we cook our food.

02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:17.740
Like, what people do in communities and stuff?

02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:19.740
So who's going to be the...

02:53:19.740 --> 02:53:21.740
I'll be the fire master.

02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:22.740
Okay.

02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:25.740
In this batch of fish, we're going to talk...

02:53:25.740 --> 02:53:26.740
I forgot the net.

02:53:26.740 --> 02:53:28.740
I told you to bring it.

02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:31.740
Now, the only thing about fishing is that it all expires

02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:33.740
so you have to move to the next tail.

02:53:33.740 --> 02:53:36.740
This is to prevent and hashtag and quotation marks.

02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:38.740
This is to prevent.

02:53:38.740 --> 02:53:39.740
Oh, hold on.

02:53:39.740 --> 02:53:41.740
I'm calibrating.

02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:44.740
Did it calibrate?

02:53:44.740 --> 02:53:45.740
Yeah, calibrate.

02:53:45.740 --> 02:53:48.740
I'm level fishing too.

02:53:48.740 --> 02:53:52.740
Oh, the trainer guy should give you a free net.

02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:53.740
Hopefully.

02:53:53.740 --> 02:53:55.740
What is that?

02:53:55.740 --> 02:53:57.740
So we're, yeah, we're just doing this

02:53:57.740 --> 02:53:58.740
and we're going to cook the fishy

02:53:58.740 --> 02:54:00.740
and then when our cooking goes up,

02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:02.740
we can start cooking other stuff

02:54:02.740 --> 02:54:04.740
and making other stuff.

02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:06.740
That brings even more...

02:54:06.740 --> 02:54:09.740
hardcore bro, watch out.

02:54:09.740 --> 02:54:12.740
Oh, no, the tail expires.

02:54:12.740 --> 02:54:14.740
Give me, give me.

02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:17.740
Never seen so many real players.

02:54:17.740 --> 02:54:19.740
Oh, that's crazy.

02:54:19.740 --> 02:54:21.740
Can we cook strong aid?

02:54:21.740 --> 02:54:24.740
Don't cook the cuttlefish.

02:54:26.740 --> 02:54:29.740
Oh, I put it in all caps, but it didn't work.

02:54:29.740 --> 02:54:33.740
We're all bought some cute cuttlefish.

02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:36.740
Calomari, no!

02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:39.740
Let's see if they know the secret roofling handshake.

02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:41.740
I'm a bot hooked up to chat.

02:54:41.740 --> 02:54:44.740
Chat GPT's Johnny Cooks in her own way.

02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:46.740
Pretending to be a human right now.

02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:47.740
I'm behind a paywall.

02:54:47.740 --> 02:54:48.740
Oh, it's fine.

02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:50.740
Chat GPT nine goes bravery.

02:54:50.740 --> 02:54:51.740
Amazing.

02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:54.740
They're like, what on earth is going on?

02:54:56.740 --> 02:54:59.740
Okay, we're actually doing really well.

02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:04.740
Runfishing.exe, honestly.

02:55:04.740 --> 02:55:06.740
I'm character AI.

02:55:09.740 --> 02:55:11.740
Oh, you wanna, you wanna what?

02:55:11.740 --> 02:55:13.740
You don't wanna kick the cuttlefish.

02:55:13.740 --> 02:55:15.740
No, you don't.

02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:17.740
Oh, we're leveling up.

02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:19.740
I can hear reeflings getting levels.

02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:20.740
I'm gonna go grabbing it.

02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:22.740
Yes, we're gonna be here for a little while

02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:24.740
until we stop burning the shrimpies.

02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:27.740
Oh, wait, doesn't that fishing tutor give you a net?

02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:28.740
Wait, come back.

02:55:28.740 --> 02:55:30.740
You can hear me anymore.

02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:34.740
I think that fishing tutor might give a net.

02:55:34.740 --> 02:55:36.740
Can I head pat?

02:55:36.740 --> 02:55:38.740
You can head pat the cuttlefish.

02:55:38.740 --> 02:55:40.740
Bunch of randies.

02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:41.740
Yeah.

02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:43.740
Oh, we're randy already.

02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:45.740
Are you sure?

02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:53.740
This random guy is like, oh.

02:55:55.740 --> 02:55:57.740
We're a bunch of randy andies.

02:55:57.740 --> 02:55:59.740
Instructor Unclear stuck in there.

02:55:59.740 --> 02:56:00.740
Oh, no.

02:56:00.740 --> 02:56:01.740
Who's making the fire?

02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:03.740
I'm making the fire.

02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:05.740
Are you already full of inventory?

02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:07.740
I'm not even full.

02:56:10.740 --> 02:56:12.740
I feel so much more fishing to do.

02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:13.740
Just run to the bank.

02:56:13.740 --> 02:56:14.740
No, no.

02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:15.740
I'll make a fire.

02:56:15.740 --> 02:56:16.740
I'll be a moment.

02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:17.740
Oh, someone made a fire.

02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:19.740
There's a fire there if you need to cook.

02:56:20.740 --> 02:56:22.740
I'm wondering.

02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:25.740
I'm actually going to do something mildly controversial.

02:56:25.740 --> 02:56:28.740
I'm going to move myself here.

02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:31.740
So you can see my inventory.

02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:34.740
There.

02:56:34.740 --> 02:56:36.740
So now you can see my inventory as well.

02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:38.740
Yeah, that's better.

02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:41.740
And look, I'm touching text.

02:56:50.740 --> 02:56:54.740
Um, um, um, um.

02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:55.740
Um.

02:56:55.740 --> 02:56:56.740
Um.

02:56:58.740 --> 02:57:00.740
No, no, no.

02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:01.740
Don't do anything.

02:57:01.740 --> 02:57:02.740
Um.

02:57:02.740 --> 02:57:04.740
Okay, I will go here.

02:57:04.740 --> 02:57:06.740
So then you can see my thing.

02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:08.740
Oh, RindLight just made me take a screenshot.

02:57:08.740 --> 02:57:10.740
Wow, RindLight's actually getting cool for that.

02:57:10.740 --> 02:57:11.740
I'm level three fishing.

02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:14.740
See, that's how much I've hardly fished up anything.

02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:19.740
Taking so long.

02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:21.740
New Twitter audio, licking chat.

02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:24.740
I mean, that audio I made yesterday was pretty cool.

02:57:24.740 --> 02:57:26.740
She's now eating reeflings.

02:57:26.740 --> 02:57:29.740
I saw a sea over.

02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:32.740
You'd let me bite me.

02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:34.740
There was an error generating a response.

02:57:34.740 --> 02:57:35.740
Oh my God.

02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:37.740
Are you guys trolling this guy?

02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:40.740
It's like I'm seven again.

02:57:40.740 --> 02:57:42.740
They're fishing levels.

02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:43.740
Oh my God.

02:57:43.740 --> 02:57:44.740
Level.

02:57:44.740 --> 02:57:46.740
Level three.

02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:50.740
Level three fishing bestie.

02:57:50.740 --> 02:57:51.740
I'm just so good.

02:57:51.740 --> 02:57:52.740
I'm actually just so good at fishing.

02:57:52.740 --> 02:57:57.740
I say that as a fishing spot disappears right in front of me.

02:57:57.740 --> 02:58:02.740
Strawny, if we eat shrimps, are we kind of accountable?

02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:11.740
You're in for a rude awakening when you learn what fish eat.

02:58:12.740 --> 02:58:15.740
So true.

02:58:15.740 --> 02:58:17.740
So lame.

02:58:17.740 --> 02:58:18.740
Oh my God.

02:58:18.740 --> 02:58:19.740
I'm level three fishing too.

02:58:19.740 --> 02:58:22.740
So win.

02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:25.740
Wait, you can share your fishing rank like that.

02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:29.740
How do we do that?

02:58:29.740 --> 02:58:30.740
What the fuck?

02:58:30.740 --> 02:58:32.740
What is going on?

02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:33.740
I'm scared.

02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:36.740
What happens if we tell them?

02:58:36.740 --> 02:58:39.740
What happens if they're like oh we hate beet tube roosts?

02:58:39.740 --> 02:58:50.900
I don't know if you can read that because I was quite far away.

02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:53.460
We're Shrimp Maxing!

02:58:53.460 --> 02:58:56.500
Shrimp Maxing Gang!

02:58:56.500 --> 02:58:59.700
Well, I'm hopping gross!

02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:01.500
Oh no!

02:59:01.500 --> 02:59:04.900
So gross!

02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:07.700
We out here Shrimp Maxing, literally Shrimp Maxing Gang.

02:59:07.700 --> 02:59:09.100
He couldn't handle the odor.

02:59:09.540 --> 02:59:14.180
Look, we are smelling quite fermenting.

02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:17.180
Average MMO player when he sees other players!

02:59:17.180 --> 02:59:18.780
Yeah, I'm getting out of here.

02:59:18.780 --> 02:59:20.580
And then, and then he'll come play.

02:59:20.580 --> 02:59:22.780
But oh, this is all bots and dead.

02:59:22.780 --> 02:59:24.820
And then finally meets like a gang of folk.

02:59:24.820 --> 02:59:27.500
And oh, yeah.

02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:29.020
900 XP an hour.

02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:29.900
One tick.

02:59:29.900 --> 02:59:33.660
Shrimping for real for real.

02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:36.620
What a shoooot.

02:59:36.620 --> 02:59:37.860
Strawni's Fish and Error.

02:59:37.860 --> 02:59:40.700
Not that you are.

02:59:40.700 --> 02:59:43.580
One might say it smells quite fishy.

02:59:43.580 --> 02:59:48.420
Drop the strat for one tick and for real for real.

02:59:48.420 --> 02:59:50.820
And if you're new to RuneScape, if you hold shift,

02:59:50.820 --> 02:59:53.500
you can drop your inventory once you click.

02:59:53.500 --> 02:59:54.660
I am a beatbit bot.

02:59:54.660 --> 02:59:58.260
Please contact Strawni if broken.

02:59:58.260 --> 03:00:00.460
Honestly, do you think the Jagex team are like,

03:00:00.460 --> 03:00:02.500
what in the earth is going on over here?

03:00:02.500 --> 03:00:03.740
We never see this kind of a...

03:00:03.740 --> 03:00:05.020
God, it takes so long.

03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:08.380
I still don't have a full inventory.

03:00:08.380 --> 03:00:10.980
My inventory.

03:00:10.980 --> 03:00:11.740
I'm not feeling it.

03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:12.980
Wait, you booped the beeps?

03:00:12.980 --> 03:00:14.500
I beeped the boops.

03:00:14.500 --> 03:00:15.580
Beep, boop.

03:00:15.580 --> 03:00:16.900
Social interaction.

03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:19.900
Eugh.

03:00:19.900 --> 03:00:22.740
How much?

03:00:22.740 --> 03:00:23.820
OK.

03:00:23.820 --> 03:00:27.020
Oh, you guys are making fires.

03:00:27.020 --> 03:00:31.540
Right, let's see what level we get once we have a full inventory.

03:00:31.540 --> 03:00:32.460
500.

03:00:32.460 --> 03:00:35.100
I booped the boop.

03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:36.180
I booped the boop.

03:00:40.020 --> 03:00:41.140
OK.

03:00:41.140 --> 03:00:41.900
We're almost there.

03:00:41.900 --> 03:00:43.700
I just need to pick up two more shrimp.

03:00:43.700 --> 03:00:44.180
Do it.

03:00:44.180 --> 03:00:46.100
Pick up two more shrimp.

03:00:46.100 --> 03:00:48.420
Check out that long.

03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:49.340
Pick up them shrimp.

03:00:52.140 --> 03:00:54.340
Dropping is faster.

03:00:54.340 --> 03:00:56.100
I threw them them on the ground.

03:00:56.100 --> 03:00:59.580
I want the XP for fishing as well.

03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:03.180
I say that as if it's not like 10 XP for a net.

03:01:03.180 --> 03:01:05.740
Honestly.

03:01:05.740 --> 03:01:09.580
Is strong a slang term too?

03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:12.020
Oh, I'm strong in myself right now.

03:01:12.020 --> 03:01:14.620
Honestly, I think it works.

03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:17.220
Any stronger?

03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:18.900
My inventory is fully F.

03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:20.500
I'm literally missing one fish.

03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:21.700
Like, please just fish it up.

03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:22.780
Oh, my gosh.

03:01:22.780 --> 03:01:25.180
Finally, you can't carry any more fish.

03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:28.780
Just click the raw anchovies or fishies.

03:01:28.780 --> 03:01:30.820
And then let's see how many we burn.

03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:32.060
We burnt the first one.

03:01:32.060 --> 03:01:34.060
Cook the same.

03:01:34.060 --> 03:01:37.460
We burnt the next.

03:01:37.460 --> 03:01:38.060
Yeah.

03:01:38.060 --> 03:01:39.700
Inventory full begin walking.

03:01:39.700 --> 03:01:42.020
Sequence find nearest fire, honestly.

03:01:45.220 --> 03:01:46.100
I'm at work right now.

03:01:46.100 --> 03:01:49.700
I feel like my boss is like, you're on RuneScape at work?

03:01:49.700 --> 03:01:51.220
Isn't that dangerous?

03:01:51.220 --> 03:01:53.300
Can't you not get fired for that?

03:01:53.300 --> 03:01:54.940
Like, please don't get fired because you're

03:01:54.940 --> 03:01:57.780
watching a RuneScape stream.

03:01:57.780 --> 03:01:59.700
I'm literally going to be online for quite a while.

03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:02.180
I don't know how long, but work from home gang.

03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:05.620
Oh, OK, OK, OK.

03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:08.820
I was going to say, imagine your boss walks past your cubicle

03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:11.060
and all they see is me typing in chat.

03:02:11.060 --> 03:02:12.580
I'm strong in myself right now.

03:02:12.580 --> 03:02:16.180
Like, I'm just getting fired for a visa for worth it.

03:02:16.180 --> 03:02:17.220
I hope no.

03:02:17.220 --> 03:02:18.700
Wait, oh, no, the fire disappeared.

03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:20.260
Sorry, I wasn't cooking that entire time.

03:02:20.260 --> 03:02:23.660
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

03:02:23.660 --> 03:02:24.940
Look, I just get so distracted.

03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:26.420
There's so many of you feeling threatened.

03:02:26.420 --> 03:02:28.100
How am I supposed to not get distracted?

03:02:28.100 --> 03:02:29.940
Oh, are we going to?

03:02:29.940 --> 03:02:31.700
Level eight cooking.

03:02:31.700 --> 03:02:38.180
Only another 91 to go because it's 99.

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:39.620
Is it technically?

03:02:39.620 --> 03:02:40.580
Are you feeling a bit better?

03:02:40.580 --> 03:02:41.140
I am.

03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:45.660
I think I needed that food and just to kind of wake up.

03:02:45.660 --> 03:02:47.660
I'm not sure why I felt so rough when I woke up,

03:02:47.660 --> 03:02:48.220
but I feel better.

03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:49.340
I've got food in my tum tum.

03:02:49.340 --> 03:02:51.500
I've got a honey tea that I can't wait.

03:02:51.500 --> 03:02:53.860
Getting a promotion from each of our boss

03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:54.900
calls in on the office.

03:02:54.900 --> 03:02:56.860
You're all she is based.

03:02:56.860 --> 03:02:58.820
Technically, you're also playing RuneScape at work.

03:02:58.820 --> 03:03:02.100
Oh, I wouldn't say streaming's work, honestly.

03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:03.980
I'd say the only time it feels like work

03:03:03.980 --> 03:03:05.540
is if I have to prepare.

03:03:05.540 --> 03:03:08.100
Like, maybe for the game shows and stuff.

03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:10.940
Level nine, by the way.

03:03:10.940 --> 03:03:11.420
That's right.

03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:13.140
Read them and wait for level nine.

03:03:13.140 --> 03:03:16.980
Boss calls you in the office and says he's watching strongy too.

03:03:16.980 --> 03:03:20.540
RuneScape takes no focus though.

03:03:20.540 --> 03:03:23.500
OK, and now I am going to hold shift

03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:27.460
and drop all these fricking, wait, hello?

03:03:27.460 --> 03:03:28.940
Wait, no, why isn't it working?

03:03:28.940 --> 03:03:29.860
I thought it was shift.

03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:31.340
Is another shift to drop?

03:03:31.340 --> 03:03:32.780
Is that am I going crazy?

03:03:32.780 --> 03:03:34.900
I'm going to see.

03:03:34.900 --> 03:03:35.420
Sorry.

03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:37.900
Oh, it just seems everywhere.

03:03:37.900 --> 03:03:38.860
Pardon me.

03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:41.940
Wait, I could have sworn it was shift to drop things far.

03:03:41.940 --> 03:03:42.660
Oh, my God.

03:03:42.660 --> 03:03:47.260
Oh, no, you guys are going to have to watch me manually draw.

03:03:47.260 --> 03:03:48.340
Bless you.

03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:49.980
Bless you.

03:03:49.980 --> 03:03:51.140
I'm manually dropping.

03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:51.980
Please don't look.

03:03:51.980 --> 03:03:54.860
I'm so embarrassed right now.

03:03:54.860 --> 03:03:57.060
Oh, I'm a bit of an imposter.

03:03:57.060 --> 03:03:58.900
OK, it's setting.

03:03:58.900 --> 03:03:59.700
Oh, it's a setting.

03:03:59.700 --> 03:04:01.500
Is it actually?

03:04:01.500 --> 03:04:03.620
Why are we going to not have it on the pen?

03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:06.060
The pen, all settings.

03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:06.940
But I did all settings.

03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:08.700
It's not going to just show my IP address.

03:04:08.700 --> 03:04:09.940
Is that controls?

03:04:09.940 --> 03:04:12.260
Drop.

03:04:12.260 --> 03:04:15.100
Game play.

03:04:15.100 --> 03:04:17.580
Oh, this is too much.

03:04:17.580 --> 03:04:19.020
I want to drop.

03:04:19.020 --> 03:04:20.900
I want to drop.

03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:22.700
Click shift to drop items.

03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:23.340
Beautiful.

03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:24.180
I actually got that.

03:04:24.180 --> 03:04:25.620
That was so good.

03:04:25.620 --> 03:04:27.500
Right, hopefully my email address didn't show up.

03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:27.860
I hate.

03:04:27.860 --> 03:04:29.940
Oh, that's just how it is.

03:04:29.940 --> 03:04:30.820
Right.

03:04:30.820 --> 03:04:31.540
Oh, there we go.

03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:32.180
Got it.

03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:33.580
Right, and then we go back to fishing

03:04:33.580 --> 03:04:35.620
because we're only level 99.

03:04:35.620 --> 03:04:40.100
I'm going to check the Char View Cooking Gate.

03:04:40.100 --> 03:04:43.540
We can do meat, chicken, and all that.

03:04:43.540 --> 03:04:46.500
Trout is 15, which is a big startup rate.

03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:49.220
So I guess we're doing this until 15.

03:04:49.260 --> 03:04:51.820
And then we're going fishing elsewhere.

03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:55.740
But as we level up, we get closer and closer.

03:04:55.740 --> 03:04:56.060
Oh, my God.

03:04:56.060 --> 03:04:58.100
Level four fishing, not to brag or anything,

03:04:58.100 --> 03:04:59.580
but level four, all of us.

03:05:04.580 --> 03:05:05.900
I'm pretty close.

03:05:05.900 --> 03:05:06.820
Level fishing.

03:05:10.420 --> 03:05:11.260
Wait, what?

03:05:11.260 --> 03:05:12.060
Are you doing a command?

03:05:12.060 --> 03:05:13.420
He's tapping a command.

03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:14.100
Well, got run.

03:05:14.100 --> 03:05:15.420
You catch the shrimp and burn them.

03:05:15.420 --> 03:05:17.220
I'll burn them to hell.

03:05:17.220 --> 03:05:18.860
Thanks for hanging.

03:05:18.900 --> 03:05:21.140
See you when you come back.

03:05:21.140 --> 03:05:22.140
Actually, I don't know.

03:05:22.140 --> 03:05:24.780
I've not decided if it's an endurance stream yet.

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:26.380
Right now, we're just memeing and dreaming

03:05:26.380 --> 03:05:28.380
and streaming and fishing.

03:05:28.380 --> 03:05:29.900
And then we're fishing and we're cooking

03:05:29.900 --> 03:05:30.900
and we're cooking and we're fishing.

03:05:33.540 --> 03:05:36.220
My mind not working.

03:05:36.220 --> 03:05:37.820
You just got to trust me for real, for real.

03:05:37.820 --> 03:05:40.060
Don't worry, I do this all the time.

03:05:40.060 --> 03:05:42.460
Don't worry.

03:05:42.460 --> 03:05:43.220
Bye-bye.

03:05:43.220 --> 03:05:44.460
Did you see it?

03:05:44.460 --> 03:05:45.060
What?

03:05:45.060 --> 03:05:47.900
What did I see?

03:05:47.900 --> 03:05:48.660
The toenail?

03:05:48.660 --> 03:05:49.460
Wait, what did I miss?

03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:50.540
Was there something on stream?

03:05:53.700 --> 03:05:54.500
I don't see it.

03:05:54.500 --> 03:05:55.580
I see you guys.

03:05:55.580 --> 03:05:56.580
We're all just hanging out.

03:06:01.900 --> 03:06:03.660
Sorry, I've got gains to get.

03:06:03.660 --> 03:06:04.780
Bye.

03:06:04.780 --> 03:06:05.900
Bye-bye.

03:06:05.900 --> 03:06:06.780
I don't have to go.

03:06:06.780 --> 03:06:09.260
Bye-bye.

03:06:09.260 --> 03:06:10.420
I don't think I was a roofling.

03:06:10.420 --> 03:06:13.380
I was someone that was interested in what we were doing.

03:06:13.380 --> 03:06:15.060
See how you feel like four hours go from there.

03:06:15.060 --> 03:06:17.900
She literally at the start was, no, this will not

03:06:17.900 --> 03:06:19.340
be an insurance human after a few hours.

03:06:19.340 --> 03:06:21.900
She doesn't know anymore.

03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:22.980
It's hard.

03:06:22.980 --> 03:06:25.500
Just the bots hanging out doing a lot of bot things.

03:06:25.500 --> 03:06:28.980
He wants to talk about his car's extended warranty.

03:06:28.980 --> 03:06:30.140
Literally.

03:06:30.140 --> 03:06:31.340
I do not want to talk to you.

03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:32.940
Leave me alone, old man.

03:06:32.940 --> 03:06:35.220
He's getting harassed by an NPC.

03:06:35.220 --> 03:06:36.580
Shadow was rude when he get.

03:06:36.580 --> 03:06:40.580
How purple are those anchovies?

03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:42.940
Or shrimpies?

03:06:42.940 --> 03:06:47.620
Oh wait, anchovies and shrimp are different?

03:06:47.660 --> 03:06:51.220
Just tip some money for another four hours.

03:06:51.220 --> 03:06:53.980
I'm like a reciprocal?

03:06:53.980 --> 03:06:55.060
A reciprocal?

03:06:55.060 --> 03:07:00.660
Donnie put text behind my screen.

03:07:00.660 --> 03:07:01.180
OK, there.

03:07:01.180 --> 03:07:02.660
Text doesn't go over me anymore.

03:07:06.140 --> 03:07:06.820
Oh my god.

03:07:06.820 --> 03:07:08.580
Leveling up, we're getting them gains.

03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:12.140
I did not realize how slow fishing was to get.

03:07:12.140 --> 03:07:14.620
My goodness.

03:07:14.620 --> 03:07:17.020
Bye-bye.

03:07:17.020 --> 03:07:19.660
She doesn't want to leave us, honestly.

03:07:19.660 --> 03:07:22.260
Like after the...

03:07:22.260 --> 03:07:24.300
So I can apply for monetization.

03:07:24.300 --> 03:07:27.380
I'm going to apply after the stream and see what happens.

03:07:27.380 --> 03:07:30.660
I don't know how long it's going to take.

03:07:30.660 --> 03:07:35.460
But tomorrow's ASMR, so that's short.

03:07:35.460 --> 03:07:38.780
And then the taste test and stream is short as well.

03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:42.220
However, it might work out better because if I get

03:07:42.220 --> 03:07:46.060
monetized, then I'm doing my pop-up monetization stream

03:07:46.060 --> 03:07:49.180
surprise thing.

03:07:49.180 --> 03:07:52.580
Oh no, I'm fishing where there's no fishie.

03:07:52.580 --> 03:07:53.620
I wish you good luck on the money.

03:07:53.620 --> 03:07:56.140
Yeah, basically YouTube just reviews the account and goes,

03:07:56.140 --> 03:07:57.940
yeah, good to go.

03:07:57.940 --> 03:07:59.220
Oh man, my bank is locked.

03:07:59.220 --> 03:08:00.700
Can you hit me up again in three days?

03:08:08.380 --> 03:08:09.820
I don't know what that means.

03:08:09.820 --> 03:08:11.780
Back to fishing.

03:08:11.780 --> 03:08:13.740
We're just fishing.

03:08:13.740 --> 03:08:18.260
But yes, we're just going to level up as much as we can do

03:08:18.260 --> 03:08:18.820
right now.

03:08:22.100 --> 03:08:23.860
Any Ring Fit Adventure streams?

03:08:23.860 --> 03:08:27.060
Yeah, 100%.

03:08:27.060 --> 03:08:32.500
I absolutely adore Ring Fit Adventure.

03:08:32.500 --> 03:08:36.420
It was really fun, as long as it's not dangerous for much.

03:08:36.420 --> 03:08:39.660
Hard, but I'm pretty sure I got pretty high last time.

03:08:39.660 --> 03:08:42.780
Do you have an idea of how many more watch hours you need?

03:08:42.780 --> 03:08:44.380
Oh, I made watchers.

03:08:44.380 --> 03:08:48.700
The problem was YouTube wasn't updating our stats for one week.

03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:52.620
Like the stats are now behind one week.

03:08:52.620 --> 03:08:55.660
Like it doesn't make sense.

03:08:55.660 --> 03:08:59.380
So only now I can apply, even though after debut,

03:08:59.380 --> 03:09:00.580
we had watch time.

03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:05.060
Like it's just a bit silly, but we're submitting.

03:09:05.060 --> 03:09:09.820
We also think now that we have one confirmed week of stats,

03:09:09.820 --> 03:09:12.100
the culling stops here.

03:09:12.140 --> 03:09:14.780
So you might be unsubscribed if you're watching in right now.

03:09:14.780 --> 03:09:17.260
I don't know, but don't be afraid to like and subscribe.

03:09:17.260 --> 03:09:19.220
The stream helps out, you know that jazz.

03:09:19.220 --> 03:09:24.020
But we think the culling has stopped.

03:09:24.020 --> 03:09:26.740
So a few ASMR group collabs and all that

03:09:26.740 --> 03:09:31.100
are going to come out shortly after monetization.

03:09:31.100 --> 03:09:35.260
Because the girls, some dummy used my email to make an account.

03:09:35.260 --> 03:09:39.300
And one of the passwords I use, that's just a word.

03:09:39.300 --> 03:09:41.020
As great news, ring fit my blood.

03:09:41.020 --> 03:09:44.460
Please don't push yourself too hard like that one time.

03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:48.820
I just really enjoyed it, but I can't do like, subscribe,

03:09:48.820 --> 03:09:50.460
and send your bank card details.

03:09:50.460 --> 03:09:52.580
Hell yeah.

03:09:52.580 --> 03:09:53.500
Just thumbs up right now.

03:09:53.500 --> 03:09:54.820
Thank you.

03:09:54.820 --> 03:09:58.420
I don't know why, but I haven't been subbed on once.

03:09:58.420 --> 03:10:01.620
Maybe it's because I got YouTube premium.

03:10:01.620 --> 03:10:04.660
I don't know what caused it, because I did get marshmallows

03:10:04.660 --> 03:10:07.660
that were like, no, I straight up got unsubbed by like three

03:10:07.660 --> 03:10:09.860
of the girls that did this or whatever.

03:10:09.860 --> 03:10:11.620
I don't know if it's also related to,

03:10:11.620 --> 03:10:13.900
if you don't watch the girls like shorts,

03:10:13.900 --> 03:10:16.180
or if you don't watch any content but subscribing,

03:10:16.180 --> 03:10:19.420
then peace out, then YouTube don't like that.

03:10:19.420 --> 03:10:21.900
And see it as bot activity, rather than someone

03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:24.340
subscribing and being like, I'll come back later and watch this.

03:10:24.340 --> 03:10:27.380
Like, not everyone watches YouTube shorts.

03:10:27.380 --> 03:10:30.220
Which reminds me, I should have sent two shorts to Emmy

03:10:30.220 --> 03:10:34.580
to review, because the editor had finished the shorts.

03:10:34.580 --> 03:10:37.620
I'm going to do that after stream.

03:10:38.620 --> 03:10:40.580
Solve by watching everyone.

03:10:40.580 --> 03:10:42.900
Literally, if you watch their shorts,

03:10:42.900 --> 03:10:45.900
or put some minutes and a watch time into them,

03:10:45.900 --> 03:10:49.420
then I think YouTube doesn't take you.

03:10:49.420 --> 03:10:52.980
I got unsubbed from some other VTubers pre-debut,

03:10:52.980 --> 03:10:53.980
but not from any of the girls.

03:10:53.980 --> 03:10:56.980
Good, good, that's what I like to hear.

03:10:56.980 --> 03:10:59.580
So me subscribing just to support is pointless.

03:10:59.580 --> 03:11:04.100
Oh no, like, actual YouTube subscribe is not pointless.

03:11:04.100 --> 03:11:06.660
What happened was the accounts were getting called

03:11:06.660 --> 03:11:09.660
because they were new, and for bot protection,

03:11:09.660 --> 03:11:11.180
we were getting wrecked.

03:11:11.180 --> 03:11:15.660
But we think now, because there's one week of confirmed stats,

03:11:15.660 --> 03:11:16.500
it's over.

03:11:16.500 --> 03:11:19.380
I don't think we got called at all recently,

03:11:19.380 --> 03:11:22.100
like today, or when I was asleep, so.

03:11:24.820 --> 03:11:29.020
Yeah, so I think it's only going up from here now, thankfully.

03:11:29.020 --> 03:11:31.260
I checked the stats of everyone's accounts,

03:11:31.260 --> 03:11:33.020
and we should have been at 5K right now,

03:11:33.020 --> 03:11:36.180
but it's okay, we'll work back up towards it.

03:11:37.020 --> 03:11:40.140
And yes, it's weird.

03:11:40.140 --> 03:11:42.060
I know it's bot protection.

03:11:42.060 --> 03:11:44.620
I had never experienced it before,

03:11:44.620 --> 03:11:48.860
and me or my, it was aggressive on us, very aggressive,

03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:51.620
but I do think it's, I genuinely do believe it's over,

03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:53.660
especially once the girls get monetized.

03:11:53.660 --> 03:11:56.260
I don't think you experience it as a monetized channel,

03:11:56.260 --> 03:11:58.700
because that just seems a bit odd,

03:11:58.700 --> 03:12:01.420
because they know if you're being watched by bots or not,

03:12:01.420 --> 03:12:02.580
so.

03:12:02.580 --> 03:12:04.500
Oh my God, my mind's a wrecking.

03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:06.180
Okay, I'm gonna slip my, slip.

03:12:06.180 --> 03:12:09.620
I'm gonna sip my tea, please.

03:12:09.620 --> 03:12:11.860
Don't do anything to the slit, okay?

03:12:11.860 --> 03:12:13.200
Oh, fuck.

03:12:19.700 --> 03:12:20.540
Delicious.

03:12:24.020 --> 03:12:26.980
But yes, I have a very fun collabs coming out soon, TM.

03:12:31.500 --> 03:12:33.740
Ah, honey tea feels so good.

03:12:34.740 --> 03:12:36.940
I can't wait YouTube to stop doing,

03:12:36.940 --> 03:12:38.420
ah, literally, it's such a shame.

03:12:38.420 --> 03:12:40.140
I felt so bad for the girls,

03:12:40.140 --> 03:12:41.460
because we were like in the Discord,

03:12:41.460 --> 03:12:43.900
and we're like, oh my God, we're at 3,000 subscribers,

03:12:43.900 --> 03:12:46.260
oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, like,

03:12:46.260 --> 03:12:47.900
getting ready to make, but like,

03:12:47.900 --> 03:12:51.220
all of us held back from doing a celebration post,

03:12:51.220 --> 03:12:52.940
because it just wasn't happening,

03:12:52.940 --> 03:12:54.300
and it was such a shame.

03:12:57.260 --> 03:13:00.100
I do have a special, like, congrats on 5K

03:13:00.100 --> 03:13:02.060
for everyone post, and a 10K,

03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:03.780
and then I don't know what's happening after that,

03:13:03.780 --> 03:13:05.820
if I should order more artwork or not.

03:13:06.780 --> 03:13:09.460
The 10K artwork is absolutely gorgeous,

03:13:09.460 --> 03:13:12.340
so I can't wait for everyone to react to it.

03:13:12.340 --> 03:13:14.900
But I can't, I can't let anyone know what it is.

03:13:14.900 --> 03:13:16.340
I don't want to ruin the surprise.

03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:18.460
Level 10 cooking!

03:13:18.460 --> 03:13:21.300
We did it, we did it!

03:13:21.300 --> 03:13:23.460
Are you squidding me right now?

03:13:23.460 --> 03:13:24.300
Brian!

03:13:24.300 --> 03:13:25.420
Can't wait.

03:13:25.420 --> 03:13:26.820
My wallet is ready.

03:13:26.820 --> 03:13:30.380
Ah, Pachinga, thank you very much for the tip again.

03:13:30.380 --> 03:13:31.620
You can't wait for what?

03:13:31.660 --> 03:13:32.660
The 10K?

03:13:33.900 --> 03:13:36.300
It's already, it's free!

03:13:36.300 --> 03:13:38.660
It's free to subscribe, young Uber.

03:13:40.460 --> 03:13:42.580
How do you mean the...

03:13:42.580 --> 03:13:43.860
Oh no, my fishy.

03:13:43.860 --> 03:13:46.580
My fire keeps, the fire's pranking me.

03:13:46.580 --> 03:13:49.060
It keeps disappearing as soon as I go get it.

03:13:50.140 --> 03:13:51.300
I'm on level 11!

03:13:52.660 --> 03:13:55.180
It stops you cooking every, every time it sells,

03:13:55.180 --> 03:13:56.220
oh, I'm in the fire now,

03:13:56.220 --> 03:13:58.660
I'm sacrificing myself for the...

03:13:58.660 --> 03:14:01.660
Nothing interesting happens, use it on the fire.

03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:04.620
I think they mean the soup with the membership.

03:14:04.620 --> 03:14:08.060
Oh, sorry, sorry, my bad, my apologies.

03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:10.820
Apologies, mate, I'm not that smart, okay?

03:14:13.460 --> 03:14:17.500
I'm like kneeling out of the fire to cook these.

03:14:23.180 --> 03:14:25.820
She, honestly, when I said I was cooking,

03:14:25.820 --> 03:14:27.700
making veal or I wasn't kidding, okay?

03:14:27.700 --> 03:14:29.580
I'm cooking by guess.

03:14:29.580 --> 03:14:31.980
Okay, who is making that noise?

03:14:34.540 --> 03:14:37.020
Sounds like someone's building something.

03:14:37.020 --> 03:14:38.140
Building something?

03:14:40.620 --> 03:14:41.940
Back to the kitchen.

03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:46.220
We're getting, oh, pardon me, sorry.

03:14:46.220 --> 03:14:48.740
Maybe we should be doing the cows, you know that,

03:14:48.740 --> 03:14:53.740
so we can get, how to say it, so we can get combat

03:14:54.500 --> 03:14:55.900
and maybe we can do a few more quests

03:14:55.940 --> 03:14:57.780
that require a tiny bit of combat

03:14:57.780 --> 03:14:59.500
so we don't get too wrecked.

03:15:00.500 --> 03:15:02.620
Is there a timetable for super membership

03:15:02.620 --> 03:15:04.260
or is it still soon?

03:15:04.260 --> 03:15:07.580
It's still soon, basically, it's gonna pop up

03:15:07.580 --> 03:15:09.580
once it happens, so we need to submit ourselves

03:15:09.580 --> 03:15:11.900
and YouTube takes its sweet time to review it

03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:14.500
and all of that, and once it's accepted,

03:15:14.500 --> 03:15:17.060
it's up to the girls, whoop, by the pope!

03:15:18.460 --> 03:15:19.300
Brian!

03:15:21.540 --> 03:15:22.660
Brian, speak.

03:15:23.660 --> 03:15:27.020
Anon, you didn't put anything in the box!

03:15:27.900 --> 03:15:30.700
Thank you for the tip, Anon, I appreciate it.

03:15:31.700 --> 03:15:32.860
I'm not gonna call you out

03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:34.700
for not putting nothing in the box.

03:15:36.060 --> 03:15:39.300
Hmm, but Brian didn't say anything

03:15:39.300 --> 03:15:40.740
and congrats if your name's Brian,

03:15:40.740 --> 03:15:42.540
you're gonna love these streams.

03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:47.540
Ha, ha, ha, oh my God, wait, you must get startles.

03:15:47.780 --> 03:15:50.460
I just got Brian, I don't know where.

03:15:52.980 --> 03:15:56.180
Hmm, what's in the box?

03:15:56.180 --> 03:15:57.020
Nothing!

03:15:58.140 --> 03:16:00.300
Wasn't me in the donal, but still, LeMau.

03:16:00.300 --> 03:16:01.500
LeMau, yeah.

03:16:03.340 --> 03:16:04.980
If your name's Brian, you'll love my streams.

03:16:04.980 --> 03:16:07.060
Maybe that should be my mole.

03:16:07.060 --> 03:16:07.900
Ah, Brian!

03:16:07.900 --> 03:16:09.500
Here's the nothing you ordered, miss.

03:16:09.500 --> 03:16:11.940
Stop, no, I purposely didn't say anything

03:16:11.940 --> 03:16:13.820
so you went tip again!

03:16:13.820 --> 03:16:16.100
I purposely didn't say anything, Anon,

03:16:16.100 --> 03:16:19.540
so you didn't do that, you giffy goober, stop it!

03:16:20.540 --> 03:16:22.220
Here's that nothing you ordered.

03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:24.340
Hmm, meh.

03:16:24.340 --> 03:16:26.620
Yeah, you think you're so smart, you little sma,

03:16:26.620 --> 03:16:29.660
you little, you setting up the desk right now, huh?

03:16:29.660 --> 03:16:31.900
You twirling your hair?

03:16:31.900 --> 03:16:34.220
You flicking your feet about the, I'm so smart.

03:16:34.220 --> 03:16:37.060
Yeah, I'm such a smart, you're such a smart alec.

03:16:37.060 --> 03:16:40.900
You're not smart, you know, on an anonymous?

03:16:40.900 --> 03:16:44.540
You're such a smart alonimus instead of smart alec.

03:16:44.540 --> 03:16:47.020
Oh, you know, I tried, I tried, okay, I tried.

03:16:47.020 --> 03:16:50.140
I don't know, something, something, something.

03:16:50.140 --> 03:16:51.580
Brian, Brian!

03:16:53.620 --> 03:16:55.900
Brian, Brian said nothing.

03:16:55.900 --> 03:16:57.220
Thank you, Brian, Brian.

03:16:58.340 --> 03:16:59.500
Brian, Brian, Brian.

03:16:59.500 --> 03:17:01.340
The one Brian in the chat right now,

03:17:01.340 --> 03:17:03.300
his face is like, so red.

03:17:05.660 --> 03:17:07.940
It's a smart fling.

03:17:07.940 --> 03:17:09.460
Oh yeah, when reeflings are smart,

03:17:09.460 --> 03:17:11.340
I'm gonna call them smartlings.

03:17:13.940 --> 03:17:15.660
I wasn't even a joke, to be honest.

03:17:15.700 --> 03:17:19.260
It wasn't even a joke, I just said what someone said in chat.

03:17:19.260 --> 03:17:20.500
Hee hee hee.

03:17:20.500 --> 03:17:22.100
Don't mind me.

03:17:22.100 --> 03:17:23.220
I just got here.

03:17:26.420 --> 03:17:28.260
He says I just got here at Lamo.

03:17:29.100 --> 03:17:30.460
Stop, that is terrible.

03:17:30.460 --> 03:17:33.220
I didn't add any more sound effects.

03:17:33.220 --> 03:17:35.660
I was busy, I was busy.

03:17:35.660 --> 03:17:37.540
I need to think about, what's a terrible joke

03:17:37.540 --> 03:17:38.660
that no one likes?

03:17:39.020 --> 03:17:44.020
What is the difference between a legume and a chickpea?

03:17:51.100 --> 03:17:53.740
I've never had a legume on my face before.

03:17:56.940 --> 03:17:58.140
Thank you, thank you.

03:17:58.140 --> 03:17:59.340
I'll be here all week.

03:18:02.620 --> 03:18:03.780
Get it?

03:18:03.780 --> 03:18:07.100
Do you get, actually, A.C. should probably tell that joke.

03:18:09.500 --> 03:18:14.500
Why was the pony taking cough medicine?

03:18:15.660 --> 03:18:18.100
Cause he was a little horse.

03:18:20.100 --> 03:18:22.940
Oh, oh sorry, I thought that was a good one.

03:18:22.940 --> 03:18:23.940
My bad, my bad.

03:18:24.940 --> 03:18:25.940
Hee hee hee hee.

03:18:28.500 --> 03:18:30.500
A horse goes to the bar.

03:18:30.500 --> 03:18:33.500
The bar man asks, why the long face?

03:18:33.940 --> 03:18:36.700
The bar man asks, why the long face?

03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:45.060
Oh, okay, okay, no more, no more, no more, no more jokes.

03:18:46.420 --> 03:18:48.220
Sorry guys, sorry, sorry.

03:18:55.020 --> 03:18:57.700
Two blondes walk into a bar.

03:18:57.700 --> 03:18:59.860
You'd think one of them would have seen it.

03:19:04.500 --> 03:19:09.500
It's like the goofiest gimmick ever, okay?

03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:12.860
Someone says, hey, strongy guess what?

03:19:15.660 --> 03:19:18.980
That's right, we're talking in chat and in stream

03:19:18.980 --> 03:19:20.860
at the same time.

03:19:20.860 --> 03:19:22.580
I chuckled chicken butt.

03:19:27.580 --> 03:19:28.940
Someone said they chuckled.

03:19:29.300 --> 03:19:33.860
We should level up jokes instead of cooking.

03:19:33.860 --> 03:19:35.780
Oh God, are we that bad?

03:19:35.780 --> 03:19:36.700
Are we joked?

03:19:36.700 --> 03:19:37.860
Sheebie slander?

03:19:37.860 --> 03:19:38.700
Wait, how?

03:19:40.300 --> 03:19:42.300
Comedian opens a comedy date.

03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:44.620
Are you, all right, okay, okay, hold on.

03:19:47.620 --> 03:19:48.980
Are you all right?

03:19:48.980 --> 03:19:51.020
No, you're all left.

03:19:56.540 --> 03:19:57.860
We're getting like five eggs.

03:19:57.860 --> 03:20:00.740
Deeper hour with these jokes, honestly.

03:20:04.660 --> 03:20:09.020
Wait, are you guys are just giving me jokes to say?

03:20:09.020 --> 03:20:10.860
Two fish are in a tank.

03:20:10.860 --> 03:20:12.940
One turns to the other and asks,

03:20:12.940 --> 03:20:15.020
how are you, do you drive this thing?

03:20:16.460 --> 03:20:18.620
I'm just stealing your jokes.

03:20:18.620 --> 03:20:22.620
I'm not even delivering them the way a comedian should.

03:20:23.620 --> 03:20:28.220
Oh my gosh.

03:20:30.100 --> 03:20:31.980
Oh, level 12 cooking.

03:20:31.980 --> 03:20:33.780
We can do trout soon.

03:20:35.460 --> 03:20:38.380
I feel like I'm taking damage of the emotional cane.

03:20:38.380 --> 03:20:39.220
Listen.

03:20:41.580 --> 03:20:44.660
Getting your material, these are terrible.

03:20:44.660 --> 03:20:45.940
A guy walks in a bar and says,

03:20:45.940 --> 03:20:47.620
oh, that was the blonde joke.

03:20:47.620 --> 03:20:49.060
Two blondes walk into a bar.

03:20:49.060 --> 03:20:50.900
You think one of them would have seen it?

03:20:52.900 --> 03:20:53.740
Hmm.

03:20:55.220 --> 03:20:56.500
I'm not burning too much.

03:20:58.260 --> 03:21:00.180
We're doing all right, we're doing all right.

03:21:00.180 --> 03:21:01.420
Oh, level 13.

03:21:01.420 --> 03:21:03.140
We're really not burning that much then

03:21:03.140 --> 03:21:05.740
if we're getting this fast.

03:21:05.740 --> 03:21:09.180
I don't know what level you stop burning shrimp at, but yeah.

03:21:10.140 --> 03:21:11.500
Reading the black ops will give me

03:21:11.500 --> 03:21:14.100
PTSD flashbacks to second chance.

03:21:14.100 --> 03:21:17.580
Honestly, that perk was so annoying.

03:21:18.780 --> 03:21:21.060
I remember being Tismo enough

03:21:21.060 --> 03:21:25.140
that I remembered if people were using it in SMD.

03:21:25.140 --> 03:21:28.700
So I would keep fricking spraying until they were dust.

03:21:34.180 --> 03:21:36.460
I could tell you the best knock knock joke

03:21:36.460 --> 03:21:37.980
if you want to go on them.

03:21:37.980 --> 03:21:40.100
I ain't got a song on board for nothing.

03:21:40.100 --> 03:21:42.620
Where do cows go on days?

03:21:42.620 --> 03:21:44.100
The movies.

03:21:46.980 --> 03:21:48.220
Oh, did you already hear that one?

03:21:48.220 --> 03:21:49.180
Okay, sorry.

03:21:50.180 --> 03:21:52.060
God, you guys are, you get a tough crowd.

03:21:52.060 --> 03:21:54.460
Tough crowd to do, honestly.

03:21:54.460 --> 03:21:55.300
Tough crowd.

03:21:56.980 --> 03:21:59.500
Some of you guys, okay.

03:21:59.500 --> 03:22:01.900
Two muffins are baking in an oven.

03:22:01.900 --> 03:22:04.100
One muffin says, boy, it sure is hot in here.

03:22:04.100 --> 03:22:07.060
The other says, oh my God, a talking muffin.

03:22:10.140 --> 03:22:12.340
Oh, didn't like that one.

03:22:12.340 --> 03:22:13.860
You guys are really...

03:22:13.860 --> 03:22:16.540
Two hydrogen atoms were walking down the street

03:22:16.540 --> 03:22:18.300
when one turns to the other.

03:22:18.300 --> 03:22:20.380
Oh dear, I've lost an electron.

03:22:20.380 --> 03:22:21.220
Really?

03:22:21.220 --> 03:22:22.060
Are you sure?

03:22:22.060 --> 03:22:23.020
I'm positive.

03:22:25.900 --> 03:22:30.500
Oh, oh, you guys know your physics.

03:22:30.500 --> 03:22:32.140
You paid attention in physics class.

03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:32.980
Lovely, lovely.

03:22:32.980 --> 03:22:33.820
That's what it is.

03:22:35.820 --> 03:22:38.540
What do you do when you cross a cow in an octopus?

03:22:38.540 --> 03:22:39.860
Cowamari.

03:22:42.940 --> 03:22:44.900
I think I'm gonna get kicked off stage.

03:22:44.900 --> 03:22:46.580
I'm getting, I'm getting on.

03:22:46.820 --> 03:22:50.100
I am, he goes, please stop.

03:22:50.100 --> 03:22:50.940
I'm dying.

03:22:53.300 --> 03:22:54.140
Right, right.

03:22:54.140 --> 03:22:54.980
We'll give that a break.

03:22:54.980 --> 03:22:55.820
We'll give that a break.

03:22:55.820 --> 03:22:56.660
We'll give that a break.

03:22:56.660 --> 03:22:58.500
No more, no more.

03:22:58.500 --> 03:23:00.140
I don't know much about real physics,

03:23:00.140 --> 03:23:01.740
but I studied VTuber physics.

03:23:01.740 --> 03:23:04.660
Oh, did you hear Twitch updated its terms of service

03:23:04.660 --> 03:23:08.780
and the VTubers have to be held to the same standard

03:23:08.780 --> 03:23:10.620
as flesh tubers?

03:23:10.620 --> 03:23:13.300
And everyone like, why did you pick YouTube?

03:23:13.740 --> 03:23:19.420
I've told many times, and I'll tell again,

03:23:19.420 --> 03:23:22.340
you cannot run a manager account on Twitch as well.

03:23:22.340 --> 03:23:23.180
Well matters.

03:23:25.700 --> 03:23:29.100
Strony's good jug dropery is one out of 5,000.

03:23:29.100 --> 03:23:30.620
Oh, that's rough.

03:23:30.620 --> 03:23:32.100
That's a rough dropery.

03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:33.500
Are you squiddin' me right now?

03:23:33.500 --> 03:23:35.020
Brian!

03:23:35.020 --> 03:23:38.100
What is the difference between the sea and Strony?

03:23:38.100 --> 03:23:40.740
Strony always tastes like fish.

03:23:44.180 --> 03:23:45.620
Brian!

03:23:45.620 --> 03:23:48.180
You got the, wait, what?

03:23:48.180 --> 03:23:49.100
Did I understand that?

03:23:49.100 --> 03:23:50.380
Iron Reaper?

03:23:50.380 --> 03:23:51.180
Thank you for the tip.

03:23:51.180 --> 03:23:51.820
What's the difference?

03:23:51.820 --> 03:23:52.900
Oh wait, I don't even take off.

03:23:52.900 --> 03:23:54.860
What's the difference between the sea and Strony?

03:23:54.860 --> 03:23:56.980
Strony always tastes like fish.

03:23:56.980 --> 03:23:58.580
The sea doesn't taste like fish.

03:23:58.580 --> 03:24:00.220
Huh?

03:24:00.220 --> 03:24:00.900
What?

03:24:00.900 --> 03:24:02.780
Like saltwater?

03:24:02.780 --> 03:24:04.060
I don't get it.

03:24:04.060 --> 03:24:06.980
Oh, you want Brian to do jokes more than me?

03:24:06.980 --> 03:24:10.620
You'd rather frickin' TTS Brian make the jokes than me.

03:24:10.700 --> 03:24:12.340
Oh, okay.

03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:14.380
Oh, okay, I see who it is.

03:24:14.380 --> 03:24:16.180
She kept telling us to be positive.

03:24:16.180 --> 03:24:17.460
It's hard without her.

03:24:17.460 --> 03:24:19.260
Oh wait, sorry, I missed the start of your joke.

03:24:19.260 --> 03:24:21.460
I think I just read the end of your joke.

03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:24.940
Oops, I just read the punchline of a joke.

03:24:24.940 --> 03:24:25.700
Easy.

03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:28.740
Brian has some real comedic timing, to be fair.

03:24:32.220 --> 03:24:33.060
What?

03:24:34.900 --> 03:24:36.980
Brian is better at delivering the jokes.

03:24:36.980 --> 03:24:38.540
Sorry, Strony, no fair.

03:24:38.540 --> 03:24:40.100
Yeah, I'm gonna fuck you in.

03:24:40.100 --> 03:24:42.300
Oh, when I went for a pee, I hardly peed, so I need it.

03:24:42.300 --> 03:24:44.060
I'm gonna force myself to hydrate quite a lot

03:24:44.060 --> 03:24:47.100
in the next few moments, cause I'm gonna forget.

03:24:47.100 --> 03:24:50.100
How many tickles does it take to make a squid laugh?

03:24:50.100 --> 03:24:51.580
Tentacles!

03:24:52.860 --> 03:24:53.860
Oh, that's a cute one.

03:24:53.860 --> 03:24:55.460
I like that one.

03:24:55.460 --> 03:24:57.540
I like that one, that's a good one.

03:24:57.540 --> 03:24:59.420
Miss Strony, this is my first stream of yours,

03:24:59.420 --> 03:25:00.780
and I find it extra uncanny

03:25:00.780 --> 03:25:03.460
that you're actually funny saying my real name so much.

03:25:03.460 --> 03:25:08.140
Oh, it's because the TTS, the text to speech,

03:25:08.180 --> 03:25:11.700
if someone don't knows, his name is Brian,

03:25:11.700 --> 03:25:13.780
so I always scream Brian,

03:25:14.620 --> 03:25:17.140
cause he interrupts me when I'm talking,

03:25:17.140 --> 03:25:18.460
cause I talk so much.

03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:20.980
I don't think the TTS has ever interrupted me

03:25:20.980 --> 03:25:22.820
when I'm not talking.

03:25:22.820 --> 03:25:24.620
I don't even think that's possible.

03:25:28.900 --> 03:25:30.420
Brian, that announcement, yes.

03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:34.260
Sorry, I'm really trying to finish this bottle of water.

03:25:35.260 --> 03:25:38.340
What's Brian's Oshi mark?

03:25:38.340 --> 03:25:39.940
Well, we'll make Brian a V-shaver.

03:25:41.900 --> 03:25:43.700
We'll get, instead of Neurosama,

03:25:43.700 --> 03:25:45.420
we've got Brian Samus.

03:25:48.220 --> 03:25:49.340
Two eggs in a pan.

03:25:49.340 --> 03:25:51.180
One says to the other, it's boiling in here.

03:25:51.180 --> 03:25:52.740
The other says, wait until you get out of here

03:25:52.740 --> 03:25:54.340
and smack you in the head.

03:25:55.420 --> 03:25:58.020
I need to add, you're making me wanting to add,

03:25:58.020 --> 03:26:00.700
like wha wha wha wha wha.

03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:01.940
Yes, Scott.

03:26:01.940 --> 03:26:05.900
Scott's are want to talk, after all,

03:26:05.900 --> 03:26:07.940
and I wish, man, true true.

03:26:09.300 --> 03:26:11.100
I have a lot of jokes about unemployment.

03:26:11.100 --> 03:26:12.700
Sadly, none of them work.

03:26:12.700 --> 03:26:15.780
Oh, who goes there?

03:26:15.780 --> 03:26:18.740
How does a squid go into battle, well armed?

03:26:18.740 --> 03:26:21.620
Get it, cause squids have eight arms, not eight legs.

03:26:21.620 --> 03:26:23.740
People think it's eight legs, but it's not,

03:26:23.740 --> 03:26:25.660
but it's cause it's like a misconception

03:26:25.660 --> 03:26:27.100
that octopi have eight legs.

03:26:28.100 --> 03:26:29.940
Hmm.

03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:31.500
Add a boo, you suck.

03:26:31.500 --> 03:26:33.740
Honestly, I probably should.

03:26:33.740 --> 03:26:38.740
I want to add a wha wha wha, you suck.

03:26:39.980 --> 03:26:41.300
Are you squidding me right now?

03:26:41.300 --> 03:26:42.940
Brian!

03:26:42.940 --> 03:26:46.900
A bear walks into a bar and asks for a gin and tonic.

03:26:46.900 --> 03:26:50.700
The bartender serves them and asks, why the big pause?

03:26:50.700 --> 03:26:53.500
The bear holds up its front legs and says,

03:26:53.500 --> 03:26:54.740
because I'm a bear.

03:26:58.100 --> 03:26:59.500
Are you squidding me right now?

03:26:59.500 --> 03:27:01.300
That was terrible, reluctantly saying.

03:27:01.300 --> 03:27:04.700
Impossible to not interrupt you when you're always yapping.

03:27:04.700 --> 03:27:06.900
Scott, help me out here.

03:27:07.900 --> 03:27:09.300
I was quiet for once,

03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:11.500
cause I was letting Brian tell his little joke.

03:27:11.500 --> 03:27:13.900
Thank you, reluctantly saying for the tip.

03:27:13.900 --> 03:27:15.500
And the terrible joke.

03:27:16.500 --> 03:27:17.500
And...

03:27:18.700 --> 03:27:20.300
Oh, I get the joke now!

03:27:20.300 --> 03:27:22.500
Oh, no, the joke's actually pretty smart.

03:27:22.500 --> 03:27:26.100
I'm sorry, there was like three little dots.

03:27:26.100 --> 03:27:31.100
It says, a bear walks into the bar and asks for a gin and tonic.

03:27:31.100 --> 03:27:32.700
The bartender serves them and says,

03:27:32.700 --> 03:27:34.500
why the big pause?

03:27:34.500 --> 03:27:36.300
As in pause in your sentence.

03:27:36.300 --> 03:27:38.100
And he says, I'm a bear.

03:27:38.100 --> 03:27:39.300
As in big pause.

03:27:39.300 --> 03:27:40.500
I'm sorry.

03:27:40.500 --> 03:27:42.100
I never got that the first time.

03:27:42.100 --> 03:27:43.500
I'm sorry.

03:27:43.500 --> 03:27:45.900
Or if on biscuit impossible to not interrupt you.

03:27:45.900 --> 03:27:48.900
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking, I'm sorry.

03:27:51.500 --> 03:27:54.900
Did you hear about the guy who got connected?

03:27:54.900 --> 03:27:56.500
Why, OBS?

03:27:56.500 --> 03:27:59.300
My OBS just is connected, but I'm still in game.

03:28:00.300 --> 03:28:01.300
I'm still here.

03:28:01.300 --> 03:28:03.100
Why does OBS do that?

03:28:03.100 --> 03:28:07.500
It just connects me for a millisecond and it gives me a heart attack.

03:28:07.500 --> 03:28:08.700
Why?

03:28:10.100 --> 03:28:11.500
Why did they do that?

03:28:11.500 --> 03:28:13.500
I said I disconnected for a second.

03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:16.100
I really dislike when OBS keeps doing it.

03:28:16.100 --> 03:28:18.500
I don't know if it's my internet or OBS.

03:28:18.500 --> 03:28:19.500
We are so back.

03:28:19.500 --> 03:28:21.100
Yeah, literally back on stream lots.

03:28:21.900 --> 03:28:23.900
Where's Johnny?

03:28:23.900 --> 03:28:24.900
I'm back.

03:28:24.900 --> 03:28:25.900
I'm back.

03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:26.900
I'm back.

03:28:26.900 --> 03:28:28.900
I've been sabotaged by the BC boys.

03:28:28.900 --> 03:28:30.900
It's time for sabotage.

03:28:34.900 --> 03:28:36.900
Do you like when I pretend to be a guitar?

03:28:38.900 --> 03:28:41.900
Do you remember that Star Wars movie?

03:28:43.900 --> 03:28:46.900
Where that was how they defeated the enemies.

03:28:46.900 --> 03:28:48.900
I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

03:28:48.900 --> 03:28:49.900
I loved it.

03:28:49.900 --> 03:28:52.100
And I cried at the other Star Trek movie that came out.

03:28:52.100 --> 03:28:53.100
I said Star Wars.

03:28:53.100 --> 03:28:54.100
I meant to say Star Trek.

03:28:54.100 --> 03:28:56.100
Sorry, pardon if I said Star Wars.

03:28:56.100 --> 03:29:00.100
The Star Trek movie and then sabotage.

03:29:03.100 --> 03:29:05.100
How do you call a cow with no legs?

03:29:05.100 --> 03:29:06.100
Grim beef.

03:29:08.100 --> 03:29:09.100
Thank you.

03:29:09.100 --> 03:29:10.100
I came up with myself.

03:29:10.100 --> 03:29:13.100
Totally didn't read it from my wreath on Indie.

03:29:13.100 --> 03:29:16.100
Karaoke where you just provide the guitar sense.

03:29:19.100 --> 03:29:20.100
Eww.

03:29:21.100 --> 03:29:22.100
Eww.

03:29:22.100 --> 03:29:23.100
I just heard the cat.

03:29:24.100 --> 03:29:26.100
The jokes are too much for the server.

03:29:26.100 --> 03:29:29.100
I think I'm killing you guys with the sound board now.

03:29:29.100 --> 03:29:31.100
I think we need to maybe give up a bit of a rest.

03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:44.100
You got me so confused where you said the Star Wars movie.

03:29:44.100 --> 03:29:45.100
That became Star Trek.

03:29:45.100 --> 03:29:46.100
Yeah, sorry.

03:29:46.100 --> 03:29:47.100
Sorry.

03:29:48.100 --> 03:29:51.100
AC DJ Streamer you girls make an instrument noises.

03:29:51.100 --> 03:29:52.100
Brian!

03:30:00.700 --> 03:30:01.700
Yeah, that's what you get.

03:30:01.700 --> 03:30:02.700
That's what you get, Anon.

03:30:04.900 --> 03:30:05.900
Thank you for the tip.

03:30:05.900 --> 03:30:07.900
Honestly, that wasn't that bad.

03:30:10.500 --> 03:30:12.500
I'll level 14!

03:30:12.500 --> 03:30:13.500
Over.

03:30:13.500 --> 03:30:14.500
Oh, the fire.

03:30:14.500 --> 03:30:16.500
The fire playing a little prank on me.

03:30:16.900 --> 03:30:17.900
Hold on, the fire's playing a prank on me.

03:30:20.900 --> 03:30:21.900
Thank you for the tip.

03:30:21.900 --> 03:30:23.900
It was actually not a bad joke I'll give you.

03:30:25.900 --> 03:30:27.900
Everyone knows that Star Wars and Star Trek are the same thing.

03:30:27.900 --> 03:30:29.900
No, it was me on my song.

03:30:29.900 --> 03:30:32.900
I really like, I really, I cried at the Star Trek movie.

03:30:32.900 --> 03:30:34.900
I'm like a little baby.

03:30:39.900 --> 03:30:42.900
Is it the radiation scene where he goes inside the chamber

03:30:42.900 --> 03:30:44.900
and Spock is like,

03:30:45.300 --> 03:30:46.300
and

03:30:46.300 --> 03:30:49.300
if you've not seen the Star Trek movie, cover your ears.

03:30:49.300 --> 03:30:51.300
He's got the original fricking.

03:30:51.300 --> 03:30:54.300
Is it Leonard, Leonard Hoffman?

03:30:54.300 --> 03:30:56.300
The, you know, Hoffman?

03:30:56.300 --> 03:30:58.300
Oh, I can't remember his name.

03:30:58.300 --> 03:30:59.300
I can't remember his name.

03:30:59.300 --> 03:31:01.300
You know what I mean, you know what I mean.

03:31:01.300 --> 03:31:03.300
He was in the original Spock.

03:31:03.300 --> 03:31:06.300
Got to meet Spock in the movie and it's crazy.

03:31:08.300 --> 03:31:10.300
Leonard Nimoy.

03:31:10.300 --> 03:31:12.300
Any Leonard Nimoyers?

03:31:12.700 --> 03:31:14.700
Right, are we staying here until level 20?

03:31:14.700 --> 03:31:16.700
Are we moving on to Trout?

03:31:16.700 --> 03:31:17.700
What are we?

03:31:17.700 --> 03:31:19.700
What's the plans, Rifle?

03:31:19.700 --> 03:31:21.700
And you guys are kind of in charge here.

03:31:21.700 --> 03:31:23.700
As much as I like to pretend that I'm the one in charge,

03:31:23.700 --> 03:31:25.700
you guys are actually in charge here.

03:31:25.700 --> 03:31:26.700
Do we?

03:31:26.700 --> 03:31:28.700
Let's just take a little look at the cooking guide.

03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:30.700
Hmm, yes, yes.

03:31:30.700 --> 03:31:33.700
A bit of, let's see what we're looking at for the, the meats.

03:31:33.700 --> 03:31:35.700
No, the fish.

03:31:35.700 --> 03:31:37.700
Okay, I guess fish is under meat.

03:31:37.700 --> 03:31:39.700
We've unlocked Trout,

03:31:40.100 --> 03:31:43.100
so we could go a barbarian village.

03:31:43.100 --> 03:31:46.100
I believe they dropped Trout and Salmon over there.

03:31:49.100 --> 03:31:51.100
What do you call a cow with one leg steak?

03:31:54.100 --> 03:31:56.100
What do you call a cow with two legs, Limby?

03:31:56.100 --> 03:31:57.100
Yeah.

03:31:57.100 --> 03:31:59.100
What do you call a cow with three legs?

03:31:59.100 --> 03:32:00.100
Tri-tip.

03:32:00.100 --> 03:32:02.100
Tri-tip.

03:32:06.100 --> 03:32:09.100
You can see if the crash occurs because the internet would be us itself.

03:32:09.500 --> 03:32:10.500
Tri-tip.

03:32:11.500 --> 03:32:13.500
Leonard Nimoy.

03:32:13.500 --> 03:32:22.500
Yes, the famous voice of old Zihar Nort from combat.

03:32:22.500 --> 03:32:24.500
KH, I don't know.

03:32:24.500 --> 03:32:26.500
I don't know why I was gonna say Mortal Kombat.

03:32:26.500 --> 03:32:30.500
I still love playing Civilization 4, just to hear his voice over.

03:32:30.500 --> 03:32:33.500
Barb Village, the classic, we're in charge, huh?

03:32:33.500 --> 03:32:35.500
Can I tell a dark joke?

03:32:35.500 --> 03:32:37.500
As long as it's not gonna be offensive.

03:32:40.100 --> 03:32:45.100
My password had to be eight characters, so I picked Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.

03:32:46.100 --> 03:32:49.100
Oh, that's good, I like that one.

03:32:50.100 --> 03:32:55.100
Don't challenge Death to a pillow fight unless you're ready for repercussions.

03:32:56.100 --> 03:32:58.100
My plan is to fall strong.

03:32:58.100 --> 03:33:04.100
Okay, we are gonna head to Barbarian Village, so drop all your fishy-fishies.

03:33:05.100 --> 03:33:08.100
We are gonna rely on...

03:33:09.100 --> 03:33:10.100
Oh, wait!

03:33:11.100 --> 03:33:13.100
Wait, can we even fish?

03:33:13.100 --> 03:33:15.100
I don't know if we can even fish.

03:33:15.100 --> 03:33:21.100
I think we need a fishing rod, and we can't even fish because we're too low level.

03:33:27.100 --> 03:33:29.100
We're too low level?

03:33:30.100 --> 03:33:32.100
For fishing? For fish?

03:33:32.100 --> 03:33:34.100
Oh, we need 20 fish!

03:33:34.100 --> 03:33:36.100
Okay, it doesn't matter, we're gonna stay here.

03:33:36.100 --> 03:33:38.100
You don't have a rod?

03:33:38.100 --> 03:33:39.100
Oh, yeah.

03:33:40.100 --> 03:33:43.100
Okay, it doesn't change your plan, sorry.

03:33:44.100 --> 03:33:47.100
I reached overall level 150, let's go.

03:33:50.100 --> 03:33:53.100
Actually, MLG, MLG, you can borrow mine.

03:33:54.100 --> 03:33:55.100
Shabby!

03:33:55.100 --> 03:33:58.100
And the harem, not to be confused with harem.

03:33:59.100 --> 03:34:02.100
How's the harem and the sheepsters going on?

03:34:02.100 --> 03:34:04.100
How did the shroom go?

03:34:05.100 --> 03:34:07.100
Got a rod right here for ya.

03:34:07.100 --> 03:34:08.100
Pants grab.

03:34:10.100 --> 03:34:13.100
Okay, I guess we're just gonna be fishing and going for it,

03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:16.100
because we can't even do fly fishing to get our own.

03:34:18.100 --> 03:34:24.100
But we are, literally, we started on 7 and we're level 15 already.

03:34:24.100 --> 03:34:27.100
And that's without getting the big stuff.

03:34:27.100 --> 03:34:28.100
Shabby raid!

03:34:28.100 --> 03:34:31.100
Hi, harem.

03:34:31.100 --> 03:34:35.100
I was gonna say haremby, but rip haremby.

03:34:36.100 --> 03:34:37.100
Bunny raid!

03:34:37.100 --> 03:34:39.100
Hello, hi guys.

03:34:39.100 --> 03:34:43.100
Today, I am playing Old School RuneScape,

03:34:43.100 --> 03:34:45.100
which you're more than welcome to join in on.

03:34:45.100 --> 03:34:49.100
We are achieving level 99 cooking.

03:34:49.100 --> 03:34:53.100
We are just at the bottom of Lumberge Castle near the mines,

03:34:53.100 --> 03:34:58.100
and we, I know, I know, haremby, my brain, because of the spell,

03:34:58.100 --> 03:35:02.100
and we are currently just fishing to cook,

03:35:02.100 --> 03:35:04.100
and then we're gonna move on shortly.

03:35:06.100 --> 03:35:07.100
Who's online?

03:35:07.100 --> 03:35:08.100
Who's online today?

03:35:08.100 --> 03:35:10.100
I actually can't remember everyone's schedule.

03:35:10.100 --> 03:35:15.100
Mercy normally comes online in quite a bit.

03:35:16.100 --> 03:35:20.100
I wanted to play with you, but my internet is absolutely...

03:35:20.100 --> 03:35:23.100
Oh, well, we are at the bottom of Lummi, if you ever wanted to join,

03:35:23.100 --> 03:35:26.100
but if your internet is crap in the bed.

03:35:26.100 --> 03:35:27.100
Is it not in me?

03:35:27.100 --> 03:35:28.100
Is in me?

03:35:28.100 --> 03:35:29.100
In me is coming on in an hour.

03:35:29.100 --> 03:35:30.100
That's correct.

03:35:30.100 --> 03:35:31.100
Brian!

03:35:31.100 --> 03:35:34.100
Why are snails bad at racing?

03:35:34.100 --> 03:35:36.100
They're sluggish.

03:35:39.100 --> 03:35:42.100
Oh, so when Brian makes a joke, you all laugh,

03:35:42.100 --> 03:35:45.100
but when I make a joke, I don't get none.

03:35:46.100 --> 03:35:49.100
Thank you, Sherm Tank, for the don't know.

03:35:49.100 --> 03:35:51.100
Again, everyone's laughing at Brian's jokes,

03:35:51.100 --> 03:35:52.100
but when I make the joke, it's terrible.

03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:54.100
In me, in me, coffin game!

03:35:54.100 --> 03:35:55.100
Oh, we're stream sniping in me.

03:35:55.100 --> 03:35:56.100
Hold on.

03:35:56.100 --> 03:35:57.100
Is she playing the coffin game?

03:35:57.100 --> 03:35:59.100
I want to see her reaction to it.

03:36:00.100 --> 03:36:02.100
I was gonna get a highlight reel made of that string.

03:36:04.100 --> 03:36:05.100
I'm sorry, strongy.

03:36:05.100 --> 03:36:07.100
Brian is funny, and you're a woman.

03:36:07.100 --> 03:36:09.100
You're not supposed to say that part out loud.

03:36:09.100 --> 03:36:11.100
That's an inside thought.

03:36:11.100 --> 03:36:14.100
That's an inside thought.

03:36:15.100 --> 03:36:17.100
Because it's actually witty, right?

03:36:17.100 --> 03:36:18.100
Right, you're done.

03:36:18.100 --> 03:36:19.100
You're done.

03:36:22.100 --> 03:36:24.100
Brian's stream, strongy's stream.

03:36:26.100 --> 03:36:27.100
Shocking behavior.

03:36:27.100 --> 03:36:29.100
Oh, there's an uncut emerald.

03:36:29.100 --> 03:36:30.100
Why did you drop it?

03:36:30.100 --> 03:36:33.100
You can use that for crafting later.

03:36:33.100 --> 03:36:34.100
I'm yonking it.

03:36:34.100 --> 03:36:35.100
Mine now.

03:36:36.100 --> 03:36:38.100
Sorry, that emerald's mine now.

03:36:38.100 --> 03:36:39.100
I'm keeping a hold of that.

03:36:40.100 --> 03:36:42.100
You can craft it.

03:36:42.100 --> 03:36:43.100
She sniped it.

03:36:43.100 --> 03:36:44.100
Wait, do you want it?

03:36:44.100 --> 03:36:45.100
Do you want it back?

03:36:45.100 --> 03:36:47.100
I can give you a back.

03:36:48.100 --> 03:36:49.100
You can...

03:36:49.100 --> 03:36:51.100
She went for the uncut one.

03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:52.100
Oh, you're done.

03:36:52.100 --> 03:36:53.100
You're done.

03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:55.100
Oh, you're already 99?

03:36:55.100 --> 03:36:57.100
What the heck level are you?

03:36:57.100 --> 03:36:58.100
125?

03:36:58.100 --> 03:36:59.100
What does that mean?

03:37:00.100 --> 03:37:03.100
You want to eat, literally, green and shiny.

03:37:03.100 --> 03:37:04.100
I'll take it.

03:37:04.100 --> 03:37:05.100
Come on, it's me.

03:37:05.100 --> 03:37:06.100
It's strongy, green and shiny.

03:37:06.100 --> 03:37:07.100
Oh!

03:37:08.100 --> 03:37:09.100
What is that?

03:37:09.100 --> 03:37:10.100
Is that a shield?

03:37:11.100 --> 03:37:12.100
No.

03:37:13.100 --> 03:37:15.100
That's awful.

03:37:16.100 --> 03:37:17.100
I can't look at it properly

03:37:17.100 --> 03:37:19.100
because of the way the camera angle's working this game.

03:37:19.100 --> 03:37:21.100
Look at that shield.

03:37:21.100 --> 03:37:22.100
Can't give up.

03:37:22.100 --> 03:37:24.100
Strongy, what do you call a man with no arms, no legs,

03:37:24.100 --> 03:37:25.100
and lives in a...

03:37:25.100 --> 03:37:26.100
In a tiger cage.

03:37:26.100 --> 03:37:27.100
Claude.

03:37:28.100 --> 03:37:29.100
Cloud?

03:37:31.100 --> 03:37:32.100
What?

03:37:34.100 --> 03:37:35.100
Did you hear the joke about strongy?

03:37:35.100 --> 03:37:37.100
It was incredible!

03:37:39.100 --> 03:37:40.100
Oh, thank you.

03:37:41.100 --> 03:37:43.100
Okay, I can fish for herring,

03:37:43.100 --> 03:37:44.100
but I don't want to do that.

03:37:45.100 --> 03:37:47.100
I'm going to be able to fish out.

03:37:48.100 --> 03:37:50.100
Am I playing the coffin game so on current?

03:37:50.100 --> 03:37:51.100
Yeah.

03:37:51.100 --> 03:37:53.100
I'm interested and see what her reaction is.

03:37:53.100 --> 03:37:54.100
I don't know what it's going to be.

03:37:55.100 --> 03:37:57.100
That joke fell a little short.

03:37:57.100 --> 03:37:59.100
Aw, this is incredible.

03:37:59.100 --> 03:38:00.100
It's a pine.

03:38:01.100 --> 03:38:02.100
Piney.

03:38:05.100 --> 03:38:06.100
Gonna walk my dog.

03:38:06.100 --> 03:38:07.100
Look, time.

03:38:07.100 --> 03:38:08.100
Walk you look.

03:38:08.100 --> 03:38:10.100
Hi strongy, how's the runescaping?

03:38:10.100 --> 03:38:13.100
We are level 15!

03:38:13.100 --> 03:38:17.100
In 99, on the road to 99, cooking.

03:38:17.100 --> 03:38:18.100
We took our sweet time,

03:38:18.100 --> 03:38:19.100
but we did some questing,

03:38:19.100 --> 03:38:21.100
which was a bag of fun.

03:38:23.100 --> 03:38:26.100
I have no idea how long we're streaming for today.

03:38:26.100 --> 03:38:29.100
Jokes about strongy are usually sure of fault.

03:38:29.100 --> 03:38:30.100
Shoot.

03:38:30.100 --> 03:38:31.100
Oh, and I'm starting.

03:38:31.100 --> 03:38:33.100
Okay, I just got annihilated because I started.

03:38:33.100 --> 03:38:35.100
I'm sorry, I can't even make a comeback to it now.

03:38:36.100 --> 03:38:37.100
If I wanted...

03:38:38.100 --> 03:38:39.100
If I wanted a comeback,

03:38:39.100 --> 03:38:41.100
I'd scrape it off your mose teeth.

03:38:44.100 --> 03:38:46.100
That's disgusting.

03:38:50.100 --> 03:38:52.100
Oh wait, maybe I should have done that.

03:38:56.100 --> 03:38:58.100
I probably should have done that one.

03:38:58.100 --> 03:39:01.100
Don't forget, level 92 is halfway.

03:39:01.100 --> 03:39:03.100
Oh, we're getting close to 92.

03:39:03.100 --> 03:39:05.100
I can feel it in my bones.

03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:06.100
Feel it in my bones.

03:39:06.100 --> 03:39:08.100
Are you actually going for 99?

03:39:08.100 --> 03:39:10.100
Yeah, I want to do it live with you guys.

03:39:10.100 --> 03:39:12.100
I think it would be so fun if we all do.

03:39:12.100 --> 03:39:17.100
And literally, Refling gave me a boatload of fish to cook.

03:39:17.100 --> 03:39:19.100
So once I stop burning fish,

03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:21.100
I'm going to use them.

03:39:21.100 --> 03:39:23.100
And I think that's going to propel me quite a lot.

03:39:23.100 --> 03:39:25.100
I want to do it all live on stream,

03:39:25.100 --> 03:39:28.100
and it's not going to be behind a member stream or anything.

03:39:28.100 --> 03:39:29.100
You guys can...

03:39:29.100 --> 03:39:31.100
We're going to need a bigger boat, I know.

03:39:31.100 --> 03:39:34.100
You guys can literally come and join me at any point as well

03:39:34.100 --> 03:39:37.100
when we do these kind of stream snipe things.

03:39:37.100 --> 03:39:39.100
I also give you a boatload of money.

03:39:39.100 --> 03:39:40.100
Yes.

03:39:40.100 --> 03:39:43.100
A Refling gave me 10 million GP.

03:39:43.100 --> 03:39:44.100
I'm like,

03:39:44.100 --> 03:39:48.100
Jagex is looking at the account like she's clearly bought right now.

03:39:48.100 --> 03:39:50.100
I have zero.

03:39:50.100 --> 03:39:54.100
Wait, you want to do it with us live?

03:39:54.100 --> 03:39:56.100
Yeah.

03:39:56.100 --> 03:39:58.100
ASMR.

03:39:59.100 --> 03:40:01.100
I have zero idea how RuneScape plays.

03:40:01.100 --> 03:40:04.100
My friends just post images of the animal models in the game,

03:40:04.100 --> 03:40:06.100
and they look very funny.

03:40:06.100 --> 03:40:08.100
Can I get a Refling pet?

03:40:08.100 --> 03:40:10.100
I don't know how to get a pet in the game.

03:40:10.100 --> 03:40:12.100
Oh my god.

03:40:14.100 --> 03:40:15.100
Oh my god.

03:40:15.100 --> 03:40:17.100
Is there like a pet that looks like a Refling?

03:40:17.100 --> 03:40:19.100
Gold laundering.

03:40:19.100 --> 03:40:21.100
Literally, Jagex is staring at my account right now.

03:40:21.100 --> 03:40:24.100
Could you imagine if I got banning at Jagex

03:40:24.100 --> 03:40:25.100
and be like,

03:40:25.100 --> 03:40:27.100
Hey, my account name's Scottlefish.

03:40:27.100 --> 03:40:28.100
I know it looks...

03:40:28.100 --> 03:40:33.100
I got banned because you guys thought I was like money buying GP or something.

03:40:33.100 --> 03:40:36.100
I'm actually just a Vtuber and we're all hanging out.

03:40:36.100 --> 03:40:38.100
Please, I'm banned.

03:40:38.100 --> 03:40:40.100
Is there a pet cracking?

03:40:40.100 --> 03:40:41.100
Oh, I can't.

03:40:41.100 --> 03:40:42.100
Oh, Ally.

03:40:42.100 --> 03:40:44.100
I just got a shock on my arm there.

03:40:44.100 --> 03:40:46.100
That wasn't supposed to happen.

03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:48.100
I don't know how I did that.

03:40:48.100 --> 03:40:52.100
I think I accidentally jammed my elbow in the nerve crack.

03:40:52.100 --> 03:40:54.100
There's nine pets.

03:40:54.100 --> 03:40:56.100
How did you even get those emotes on screen?

03:41:02.100 --> 03:41:03.100
Gold laundering.

03:41:03.100 --> 03:41:05.100
If they ban you, it's because they...

03:41:05.100 --> 03:41:07.100
They heard the joke.

03:41:11.100 --> 03:41:13.100
Crack and deez.

03:41:13.100 --> 03:41:15.100
Nevermind, please don't.

03:41:16.100 --> 03:41:18.100
Look, all hail the fire.

03:41:18.100 --> 03:41:20.100
All hail the fire.

03:41:22.100 --> 03:41:24.100
I'm getting close to the next level.

03:41:24.100 --> 03:41:26.100
I keep burning.

03:41:26.100 --> 03:41:28.100
Look how much I'm still burning.

03:41:28.100 --> 03:41:30.100
I'm like burning massive amounts.

03:41:30.100 --> 03:41:32.100
I wonder when you stop burning shrimpies.

03:41:32.100 --> 03:41:34.100
Maybe level 20?

03:41:34.100 --> 03:41:36.100
I feel like that's like over-leveled.

03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:38.100
For the fire.

03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:43.100
Wah, 16!

03:41:45.100 --> 03:41:47.100
Let's go.

03:41:47.100 --> 03:41:48.100
Maybe a pet slug.

03:41:48.100 --> 03:41:50.100
Slugs are close to Carlfish.

03:41:50.100 --> 03:41:51.100
Yeah.

03:41:52.100 --> 03:41:54.100
She is not cooking.

03:41:54.100 --> 03:41:56.100
Literally, everything's burning.

03:41:56.100 --> 03:41:59.100
I'm like missing out on so much HP.

03:41:59.100 --> 03:42:00.100
XP.

03:42:03.100 --> 03:42:05.100
There.

03:42:06.100 --> 03:42:08.100
Hopefully the fishing gets a bit faster

03:42:08.100 --> 03:42:10.100
because seriously, this is taken forever

03:42:10.100 --> 03:42:12.100
at this fishing base.

03:42:18.100 --> 03:42:21.100
Juke pet is closest to a slug.

03:42:23.100 --> 03:42:25.100
Are we sluggy-wuggy?

03:42:26.100 --> 03:42:28.100
What do you call a man with no arms

03:42:28.100 --> 03:42:30.100
and no legs on your front porch?

03:42:30.100 --> 03:42:31.100
Matt.

03:42:33.100 --> 03:42:35.100
Congrats if your name's Matt.

03:42:35.100 --> 03:42:37.100
Shout out to Matt.

03:42:39.100 --> 03:42:41.100
You guys are going to start sending puns

03:42:41.100 --> 03:42:43.100
where the finishing line is like actual names.

03:42:43.100 --> 03:42:45.100
I got true.

03:42:45.100 --> 03:42:47.100
I got true. You can start cooking at 15.

03:42:47.100 --> 03:42:49.100
Oh, you got me?

03:42:51.100 --> 03:42:53.100
My inventory.

03:42:54.100 --> 03:42:56.100
Woah!

03:42:56.100 --> 03:42:58.100
Reefling!

03:42:58.100 --> 03:43:00.100
That's so much!

03:43:00.100 --> 03:43:02.100
Oh my god.

03:43:02.100 --> 03:43:04.100
Thank you.

03:43:04.100 --> 03:43:06.100
Oh my god.

03:43:06.100 --> 03:43:08.100
This will definitely go...

03:43:08.100 --> 03:43:10.100
We're probably going to artificially inflate.

03:43:10.100 --> 03:43:12.100
Thank you, Reefling.

03:43:12.100 --> 03:43:14.100
I appreciate that.

03:43:14.100 --> 03:43:16.100
I think when we get cooking level 20,

03:43:16.100 --> 03:43:18.100
we'll take off and see

03:43:18.100 --> 03:43:20.100
if we can

03:43:20.100 --> 03:43:22.100
snipe some fishies.

03:43:22.100 --> 03:43:24.100
Uh...

03:43:24.100 --> 03:43:26.100
How you...

03:43:26.100 --> 03:43:28.100
Barbarian Village.

03:43:28.100 --> 03:43:30.100
There's normally bots always running up Barbarian Village.

03:43:30.100 --> 03:43:32.100
And we can literally pick up the fish

03:43:32.100 --> 03:43:34.100
that's on the floor.

03:43:34.100 --> 03:43:36.100
My only worry is that it might be

03:43:38.100 --> 03:43:40.100
quiet and we might have to swap

03:43:40.100 --> 03:43:42.100
to a different server.

03:43:42.100 --> 03:43:44.100
Who owns this hill?

03:43:44.100 --> 03:43:46.100
We don't know. We're ten ants.

03:43:48.100 --> 03:43:50.100
Okay.

03:43:50.100 --> 03:43:52.100
You're done. You're done. Get out of here.

03:43:54.100 --> 03:43:56.100
I guess the riveting gameplay,

03:43:56.100 --> 03:43:58.100
the overruns get riveted and literally

03:43:58.100 --> 03:44:00.100
just click and point similar.

03:44:00.100 --> 03:44:02.100
But look how many Reeflings there are. Seriously.

03:44:02.100 --> 03:44:04.100
This is all chilling.

03:44:04.100 --> 03:44:06.100
It's a bit chilly.

03:44:10.100 --> 03:44:12.100
Hydration check.

03:44:12.100 --> 03:44:14.100
I'm really needing a hydrate.

03:44:14.100 --> 03:44:16.100
Oh! That was like bats coming out of him.

03:44:20.100 --> 03:44:22.100
Barbarian Fishing Spot on World Through 1

03:44:22.100 --> 03:44:24.100
is one of the greatest free-to-play areas.

03:44:24.100 --> 03:44:26.100
Okay. We'll probably do that next.

03:44:28.100 --> 03:44:30.100
Mmm. Oh, do you want me to be reactive?

03:44:32.100 --> 03:44:34.100
Oh, that really didn't...

03:44:34.100 --> 03:44:36.100
Yeah. Okay. Maybe not reactive today.

03:44:36.100 --> 03:44:38.100
Maybe another day.

03:44:38.100 --> 03:44:40.100
You'll have to hate the chat though.

03:44:40.100 --> 03:44:42.100
Oh, because it's boss.

03:44:42.100 --> 03:44:44.100
Are you squiddin' me around?

03:44:44.100 --> 03:44:46.100
Brian!

03:44:46.100 --> 03:44:48.100
Brian, that's inappropriate!

03:44:48.100 --> 03:44:50.100
Thank you, Iron Ripper, for the tip.

03:44:50.100 --> 03:44:52.100
I can so cook some pains, okay?

03:44:52.100 --> 03:44:54.100
I'm getting there.

03:44:54.100 --> 03:44:56.100
You know?

03:44:56.100 --> 03:44:58.100
Got to let me...

03:44:58.100 --> 03:45:00.100
Got to let me get a bit more experienced.

03:45:02.100 --> 03:45:04.100
Jesus walked into a hotel

03:45:04.100 --> 03:45:06.100
and tossed three nails on the counter

03:45:06.100 --> 03:45:08.100
and said, put me up for the next...

03:45:08.100 --> 03:45:10.100
Ooh!

03:45:10.100 --> 03:45:12.100
I don't...

03:45:12.100 --> 03:45:14.100
I'm not sure if I can do that.

03:45:14.100 --> 03:45:16.100
I don't...

03:45:16.100 --> 03:45:18.100
I'm not sure if we're going to do a sound reaction to that one.

03:45:18.100 --> 03:45:20.100
Wait.

03:45:20.100 --> 03:45:22.100
The cuttlefish cooking fish.

03:45:22.100 --> 03:45:24.100
No! It's the circle of life for fishes.

03:45:24.100 --> 03:45:26.100
They eat each other.

03:45:26.100 --> 03:45:28.100
No, no, no, no, no.

03:45:28.100 --> 03:45:30.100
Oh, my God. Is the fishing going faster?

03:45:30.100 --> 03:45:32.100
I literally caught two in a row there.

03:45:32.100 --> 03:45:34.100
I need one more and I level up.

03:45:36.100 --> 03:45:38.100
Mmm.

03:45:38.100 --> 03:45:40.100
Ah! Went away.

03:45:44.100 --> 03:45:46.100
Wait, does that mean you eat reeflings?

03:45:46.100 --> 03:45:48.100
Only the ones that want board.

03:45:52.100 --> 03:45:54.100
I can bring you back up again if you want.

03:45:56.100 --> 03:45:58.100
Oh, like a cat!

03:45:58.100 --> 03:46:00.100
It's...

03:46:02.100 --> 03:46:04.100
All these jokes are really cracking me up.

03:46:06.100 --> 03:46:08.100
Oh, shucks, guys.

03:46:08.100 --> 03:46:10.100
I love the way you hate me up.

03:46:10.100 --> 03:46:12.100
You're so good.

03:46:14.100 --> 03:46:16.100
You're so good to me.

03:46:16.100 --> 03:46:18.100
Hello! Hi, hi!

03:46:18.100 --> 03:46:20.100
We're playing Old School Brits' Game.

03:46:20.100 --> 03:46:22.100
And we're leveling up.

03:46:22.100 --> 03:46:24.100
Who's driving this thing?

03:46:24.100 --> 03:46:26.100
Mmm.

03:46:26.100 --> 03:46:28.100
My only concern

03:46:28.100 --> 03:46:30.100
cooking trout right now, even though I'm leveled,

03:46:30.100 --> 03:46:32.100
is I'm just going to burn it

03:46:32.100 --> 03:46:34.100
all, which is such a waste.

03:46:34.100 --> 03:46:36.100
I don't want it to be a waste.

03:46:38.100 --> 03:46:40.100
Yeah.

03:46:40.100 --> 03:46:42.100
It's a gang, gang, gang, gang.

03:46:42.100 --> 03:46:44.100
Gang, gang, gang, gang.

03:46:44.100 --> 03:46:46.100
Is that a new reefling?

03:46:46.100 --> 03:46:48.100
Identified.

03:46:54.100 --> 03:46:56.100
That reefling's beating up that route.

03:47:02.100 --> 03:47:04.100
My son had been

03:47:04.100 --> 03:47:06.100
eating electrical cords.

03:47:06.100 --> 03:47:08.100
What did I do? Grandumentally conduct myself.

03:47:08.100 --> 03:47:10.100
Right, right.

03:47:10.100 --> 03:47:12.100
You know what? Sound effect.

03:47:16.100 --> 03:47:18.100
Oh, I got 4K.

03:47:18.100 --> 03:47:20.100
Did I finally reach 4K subscribers?

03:47:20.100 --> 03:47:22.100
But we didn't get called this time.

03:47:22.100 --> 03:47:24.100
A Christmas miracle.

03:47:24.100 --> 03:47:26.100
Thank you for everyone

03:47:26.100 --> 03:47:28.100
who has subscribed. I appreciate it greatly.

03:47:28.100 --> 03:47:30.100
I will start to...

03:47:30.100 --> 03:47:32.100
Once I get monetized, I will start to

03:47:32.100 --> 03:47:34.100
slip out the

03:47:34.100 --> 03:47:36.100
1000

03:47:36.100 --> 03:47:38.100
subscriber

03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:40.100
and thank you ASMR videos very shortly.

03:47:42.100 --> 03:47:44.100
But thank you so much. Don't jinx it.

03:47:44.100 --> 03:47:46.100
I don't know.

03:47:46.100 --> 03:47:48.100
Now that we've got our YouTube stats updated,

03:47:48.100 --> 03:47:50.100
I'm going to apply for monetization

03:47:50.100 --> 03:47:52.100
and then I think the culling just stops after that.

03:47:52.100 --> 03:47:54.100
I did the same to Sheebie

03:47:54.100 --> 03:47:56.100
and nothing happened.

03:47:56.100 --> 03:47:58.100
I think

03:47:58.100 --> 03:48:00.100
it's over. I do think it's over.

03:48:00.100 --> 03:48:02.100
Did you know

03:48:02.100 --> 03:48:04.100
that in every 5 years,

03:48:04.100 --> 03:48:06.100
the Red Deer in Scotland have to be culled

03:48:06.100 --> 03:48:08.100
over running the forest because

03:48:08.100 --> 03:48:10.100
wolves used to be a natural

03:48:10.100 --> 03:48:12.100
predator

03:48:12.100 --> 03:48:14.100
in the United Kingdom.

03:48:14.100 --> 03:48:16.100
But then once they were eradicated,

03:48:16.100 --> 03:48:18.100
basically the deer,

03:48:18.100 --> 03:48:20.100
obviously their population just went crazy.

03:48:20.100 --> 03:48:22.100
Man, I used to play this with my cousin

03:48:22.100 --> 03:48:24.100
and friend after school when I was younger.

03:48:24.100 --> 03:48:26.100
My name was...

03:48:26.100 --> 03:48:28.100
Ay yo, don't put your gamer tie.

03:48:30.100 --> 03:48:32.100
What do you call a Scotsman

03:48:32.100 --> 03:48:34.100
who is standing in the doorway?

03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:36.100
What do you call a Scotsman

03:48:36.100 --> 03:48:38.100
who is standing in his...

03:48:38.100 --> 03:48:40.100
Oh, home.

03:48:40.100 --> 03:48:42.100
Okay, you're done.

03:48:42.100 --> 03:48:44.100
You're done.

03:48:44.100 --> 03:48:46.100
Heim is slang for

03:48:46.100 --> 03:48:48.100
home

03:48:48.100 --> 03:48:50.100
in my bit means my house

03:48:50.100 --> 03:48:52.100
in Scots.

03:48:52.100 --> 03:48:54.100
I struggle

03:48:54.100 --> 03:48:56.100
with Roman numerals

03:48:56.100 --> 03:48:58.100
until I get to 159.

03:48:58.100 --> 03:49:00.100
Then I just click.

03:49:00.100 --> 03:49:02.100
Oh, then it just clicks.

03:49:02.100 --> 03:49:04.100
Okay, okay.

03:49:06.100 --> 03:49:08.100
I'm going to open up marshmallows in a minute.

03:49:08.100 --> 03:49:10.100
If we get any more puns, you're all done.

03:49:12.100 --> 03:49:14.100
I tell you more puns,

03:49:14.100 --> 03:49:16.100
but I'm not feeling very punny.

03:49:18.100 --> 03:49:20.100
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.

03:49:20.100 --> 03:49:22.100
Yo, just one Brian.

03:49:22.100 --> 03:49:24.100
Whoa, I'm actually not...

03:49:24.100 --> 03:49:26.100
Oh, I took this...

03:49:26.100 --> 03:49:28.100
I was going to say I'm actually not burning that much.

03:49:28.100 --> 03:49:30.100
I burned two so far.

03:49:32.100 --> 03:49:34.100
Did I take part in the deer calling?

03:49:34.100 --> 03:49:36.100
I did not.

03:49:36.100 --> 03:49:38.100
I just know...

03:49:38.100 --> 03:49:40.100
I just remember reading it in a book

03:49:40.100 --> 03:49:42.100
and I was like, yeah, that makes sense.

03:49:42.100 --> 03:49:44.100
Needs the marshmallows for the campfire.

03:49:44.100 --> 03:49:46.100
Why

03:49:46.100 --> 03:49:48.100
is Jesus the worst teammate

03:49:48.100 --> 03:49:50.100
in an online shirt? Take some 3D...

03:49:50.100 --> 03:49:52.100
Okay, you're done, you're done.

03:49:52.100 --> 03:49:54.100
No more puns.

03:49:54.100 --> 03:49:56.100
We love Brian. Yeah, clearly you love Brian.

03:49:56.100 --> 03:49:58.100
You'll laugh when it's his joke,

03:49:58.100 --> 03:50:00.100
but when it's my joke, um, crickets.

03:50:03.100 --> 03:50:05.100
Wow.

03:50:05.100 --> 03:50:07.100
Cooking, best I can do is burn meat.

03:50:07.100 --> 03:50:09.100
Literally, I'm burning so much still.

03:50:09.100 --> 03:50:11.100
I'm like, getting pretty high level.

03:50:11.100 --> 03:50:13.100
I feel like...

03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:15.100
All things considered, hold on, let me check.

03:50:15.100 --> 03:50:17.100
Um, yeah.

03:50:17.100 --> 03:50:19.100
I'm 17 cooking and I'm still burning shrimp.

03:50:19.100 --> 03:50:21.100
I feel like 15 should have been the shrimp cut off.

03:50:21.100 --> 03:50:25.100
If a shrimp is a one level one, um,

03:50:25.100 --> 03:50:27.100
like cut off,

03:50:27.100 --> 03:50:29.100
I feel like burnt shrimp is a lot.

03:50:30.100 --> 03:50:32.100
Emmy's gone live in 5 minutes,

03:50:32.100 --> 03:50:34.100
playing the coffin of her lore video.

03:50:37.100 --> 03:50:39.100
And before anyone says,

03:50:39.100 --> 03:50:41.100
did your development team just copy that game?

03:50:41.100 --> 03:50:43.100
No, actually, no one in the development team

03:50:43.100 --> 03:50:46.100
had played the game at the point she was conceptualised.

03:50:46.100 --> 03:50:49.100
She was conceptualised in my image,

03:50:49.100 --> 03:50:51.100
because

03:50:51.100 --> 03:50:53.100
Con of Bro is the best,

03:50:53.100 --> 03:50:55.100
and I don't care what anyone says.

03:50:56.100 --> 03:50:58.100
Hmm.

03:50:58.100 --> 03:51:00.100
Don't be jealous of Brian,

03:51:00.100 --> 03:51:02.100
only because he makes better jokes.

03:51:02.100 --> 03:51:04.100
I mean, yes, true, but you have other qualities.

03:51:04.100 --> 03:51:06.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:51:06.100 --> 03:51:08.100
Andy and Lily.

03:51:08.100 --> 03:51:10.100
Where should you go if you can't stop

03:51:10.100 --> 03:51:12.100
reciting Scottish poetry?

03:51:12.100 --> 03:51:14.100
Ah, then no one's gonna get that.

03:51:14.100 --> 03:51:16.100
Rabby Burns is one of her famous poets.

03:51:16.100 --> 03:51:19.100
Who come and talk to me?

03:51:19.100 --> 03:51:21.100
Oh, someone wants to trade with me.

03:51:21.100 --> 03:51:23.100
Sorry, I missed it. Sorry, I don't know who's sending me a trade-off.

03:51:23.100 --> 03:51:25.100
I apologise.

03:51:25.100 --> 03:51:27.100
What?

03:51:27.100 --> 03:51:29.100
What is that?

03:51:29.100 --> 03:51:31.100
Reefling.

03:51:31.100 --> 03:51:33.100
Is that gold?

03:51:33.100 --> 03:51:35.100
It's gold!

03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:39.100
No way!

03:51:39.100 --> 03:51:41.100
No way!

03:51:41.100 --> 03:51:43.100
I'm literally warting,

03:51:43.100 --> 03:51:45.100
literally level 17 cooking,

03:51:45.100 --> 03:51:47.100
and I'm dripped out in the gold.

03:51:47.100 --> 03:51:49.100
Reefling!

03:51:49.100 --> 03:51:51.100
Thank you!

03:51:51.100 --> 03:51:53.100
Oh my god, I'm stunned.

03:51:53.100 --> 03:51:55.100
Hold on, I need to do a little dance.

03:51:55.100 --> 03:51:57.100
I need to show it off.

03:51:57.100 --> 03:51:59.100
Wait, let me go in the hell so you can all see me, okay?

03:51:59.100 --> 03:52:01.100
Alright, I need to face you from the hell.

03:52:01.100 --> 03:52:03.100
So I'm on the hell, and you face there.

03:52:03.100 --> 03:52:05.100
Ready? Ready? We go stunned on them.

03:52:05.100 --> 03:52:07.100
We go stunned.

03:52:07.100 --> 03:52:09.100
Hey, that's right. Hey, a little parallel.

03:52:09.100 --> 03:52:11.100
See it from the back, see it from the back.

03:52:11.100 --> 03:52:13.100
Yeah, that's right, do a little dance.

03:52:13.100 --> 03:52:15.100
That's right, that's right, stunned on them.

03:52:15.100 --> 03:52:17.100
Dancing.

03:52:17.100 --> 03:52:19.100
That's right, gold, gold, gold, baby.

03:52:19.100 --> 03:52:21.100
Yeah, we love...

03:52:21.100 --> 03:52:23.100
I love the head.

03:52:23.100 --> 03:52:25.100
Bang a mot is absolutely awful.

03:52:25.100 --> 03:52:27.100
That is awful, that mot.

03:52:27.100 --> 03:52:29.100
Oh my god.

03:52:29.100 --> 03:52:31.100
Yeah, we love gold, play an apron over here.

03:52:31.100 --> 03:52:33.100
Thanks, god, you are cute.

03:52:33.100 --> 03:52:35.100
Brian!

03:52:35.100 --> 03:52:37.100
Ooh!

03:52:37.100 --> 03:52:39.100
Oh no, TTS didn't meet that out.

03:52:39.100 --> 03:52:41.100
Oh no.

03:52:41.100 --> 03:52:43.100
Or did it? Did I talk over it? I'm sorry.

03:52:43.100 --> 03:52:45.100
Brian, Iron, thank you for the tip again.

03:52:45.100 --> 03:52:47.100
You can't cook, you can't make jokes.

03:52:47.100 --> 03:52:49.100
Yeah, you are cute.

03:52:49.100 --> 03:52:51.100
So the thing I got from me.

03:52:51.100 --> 03:52:53.100
We started out and we blown them a kiss.

03:52:53.100 --> 03:52:55.100
You want to beat me?

03:52:55.100 --> 03:52:57.100
Oh, you want to beat me because I've got that gold?

03:52:57.100 --> 03:52:59.100
Oh yeah, you do.

03:52:59.100 --> 03:53:01.100
Panic. Oh, look at that.

03:53:01.100 --> 03:53:03.100
Hey, hey, hit him with the knees.

03:53:03.100 --> 03:53:05.100
Hit him with the knees.

03:53:05.100 --> 03:53:07.100
Hit him with the knees.

03:53:07.100 --> 03:53:09.100
Oh my god, that's so good.

03:53:09.100 --> 03:53:11.100
Okay, fashion shows over.

03:53:11.100 --> 03:53:13.100
Folk straight back to the sleeve mill.

03:53:13.100 --> 03:53:15.100
Over again.

03:53:15.100 --> 03:53:17.100
Oh my god, we hit him with the knees.

03:53:17.100 --> 03:53:19.100
Oh, that was so good.

03:53:19.100 --> 03:53:21.100
The drip is so good.

03:53:21.100 --> 03:53:23.100
Thank you so much for playing.

03:53:23.100 --> 03:53:25.100
You are throwing everything into that head bang.

03:53:25.100 --> 03:53:27.100
Honestly.

03:53:27.100 --> 03:53:29.100
Blowing out your back.

03:53:29.100 --> 03:53:31.100
What?

03:53:31.100 --> 03:53:33.100
Blowing out your back?

03:53:33.100 --> 03:53:35.100
You want to blow my back out?

03:53:35.100 --> 03:53:37.100
Oh my god.

03:53:37.100 --> 03:53:39.100
I love the gold.

03:53:39.100 --> 03:53:41.100
It so doesn't match my green or purple,

03:53:41.100 --> 03:53:43.100
but I don't care.

03:53:43.100 --> 03:53:45.100
It's so good.

03:53:47.100 --> 03:53:49.100
I didn't even know you could get

03:53:49.100 --> 03:53:51.100
golden chef's hat and stuff.

03:53:51.100 --> 03:53:53.100
The fact that I'm level 17 in cooking

03:53:53.100 --> 03:53:55.100
makes it even funnier that I'm dripped out

03:53:55.100 --> 03:53:57.100
in golden chef stuff.

03:53:57.100 --> 03:53:59.100
Honestly.

03:53:59.100 --> 03:54:01.100
Time's straight.

03:54:01.100 --> 03:54:03.100
The richest and most popular

03:54:03.100 --> 03:54:05.100
cooking rinse scape, honestly.

03:54:05.100 --> 03:54:07.100
Wait, hold on.

03:54:07.100 --> 03:54:09.100
No.

03:54:09.100 --> 03:54:11.100
It's Emmy.

03:54:11.100 --> 03:54:13.100
Is it real Emmy?

03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:15.100
Are you guys fricking throwing as Emmy?

03:54:15.100 --> 03:54:17.100
Except trade.

03:54:17.100 --> 03:54:19.100
Is Emmy here?

03:54:19.100 --> 03:54:21.100
Or is Emmy doing this right before her stream?

03:54:21.100 --> 03:54:23.100
Emmy, is that you?

03:54:23.100 --> 03:54:25.100
Emmy?

03:54:25.100 --> 03:54:27.100
Is that her?

03:54:27.100 --> 03:54:29.100
Emmy? She's giving me her coins

03:54:29.100 --> 03:54:31.100
from Starter Island.

03:54:31.100 --> 03:54:33.100
Her 25 coins.

03:54:33.100 --> 03:54:35.100
Emmy?

03:54:35.100 --> 03:54:37.100
Is it imposter?

03:54:37.100 --> 03:54:39.100
If it's Emmy, it would be like, no way.

03:54:39.100 --> 03:54:41.100
It's a new account. She gave me her...

03:54:41.100 --> 03:54:43.100
She gave me the coins from

03:54:43.100 --> 03:54:45.100
Tutorial Island.

03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:47.100
Little sister?

03:54:47.100 --> 03:54:49.100
Say two?

03:54:49.100 --> 03:54:51.100
Oh, I need to give her bad French.

03:54:53.100 --> 03:54:55.100
Oh, thank you for the bond offer.

03:54:55.100 --> 03:54:57.100
I bought membership for a month. Thank you so much.

03:54:57.100 --> 03:54:59.100
Please keep that bond for yourself.

03:54:59.100 --> 03:55:01.100
I have membership for a month. I think we're going to try

03:55:01.100 --> 03:55:03.100
and do 99 cooking in a month.

03:55:03.100 --> 03:55:05.100
Thank you so much for that offer, though. I really appreciate that.

03:55:05.100 --> 03:55:07.100
Really do.

03:55:07.100 --> 03:55:09.100
Is that a bond?

03:55:09.100 --> 03:55:11.100
Is that Emmy?

03:55:11.100 --> 03:55:13.100
Do we know if it's Emmy?

03:55:13.100 --> 03:55:15.100
She's going to build up stream and she's either

03:55:15.100 --> 03:55:17.100
going to be all cheeky and like,

03:55:17.100 --> 03:55:19.100
of course that was me.

03:55:19.100 --> 03:55:21.100
Or she's going to be like, what?

03:55:21.100 --> 03:55:23.100
Rins...what? Rinscape?

03:55:23.100 --> 03:55:25.100
I've never played Rinscape before.

03:55:27.100 --> 03:55:29.100
I've never played that game before.

03:55:31.100 --> 03:55:33.100
Oh my god, Stroneys, why are you coded?

03:55:33.100 --> 03:55:35.100
Rinscape.

03:55:37.100 --> 03:55:39.100
Scaling costume homie is probably

03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:41.100
in there. Wait, what?

03:55:41.100 --> 03:55:43.100
Are we getting bullies?

03:55:43.100 --> 03:55:45.100
Are we bullying each other?

03:55:45.100 --> 03:55:47.100
We better not be.

03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:51.100
She's...

03:55:51.100 --> 03:55:53.100
Hope on the phone.

03:55:53.100 --> 03:55:55.100
Can't wait for the 99 Kicking.

03:55:55.100 --> 03:55:57.100
Your fish dates will be fantastic.

03:55:57.100 --> 03:55:59.100
Oh.

03:56:01.100 --> 03:56:03.100
That was actually pretty good.

03:56:03.100 --> 03:56:05.100
Who wants to trade?

03:56:05.100 --> 03:56:07.100
Who...who is yummy?

03:56:07.100 --> 03:56:09.100
Who is yummy?

03:56:09.100 --> 03:56:11.100
I thought it said who is Emmy. I've got Emmy on my mind now.

03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:13.100
Oh, oh.

03:56:13.100 --> 03:56:15.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:19.100
Refluence, how are you also

03:56:19.100 --> 03:56:21.100
reflate?

03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:23.100
Bro, we need to take this to the bank like right now.

03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:25.100
I cannot be standing with this much money on me.

03:56:25.100 --> 03:56:27.100
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

03:56:31.100 --> 03:56:33.100
What? What? How are you also rich in this game?

03:56:37.100 --> 03:56:39.100
Oh, you can't be telling your ages.

03:56:39.100 --> 03:56:41.100
A.C. is going to be happy that you're all

03:56:41.100 --> 03:56:43.100
O.G. sons.

03:56:43.100 --> 03:56:45.100
She's going to be in an extra smug about it.

03:56:45.100 --> 03:56:47.100
Agnashia.

03:56:47.100 --> 03:56:49.100
How are you also rich in this game? How do you

03:56:49.100 --> 03:56:51.100
make money in this game, honestly?

03:56:51.100 --> 03:56:53.100
Maybe we should...

03:56:53.100 --> 03:56:55.100
Winner.

03:56:55.100 --> 03:56:57.100
I'm about to level up. What level?

03:56:57.100 --> 03:56:59.100
I said I'm about to level up.

03:56:59.100 --> 03:57:01.100
Okay, there we go. 18

03:57:01.100 --> 03:57:03.100
Kooten. Okay, that's good.

03:57:03.100 --> 03:57:05.100
We're so close to 20.

03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:07.100
Maybe we should stick around.

03:57:07.100 --> 03:57:09.100
Oh my God, look how much...

03:57:09.100 --> 03:57:11.100
Look at the fat stacks.

03:57:11.100 --> 03:57:13.100
Like, oh my gosh.

03:57:13.100 --> 03:57:15.100
Oh my gosh.

03:57:15.100 --> 03:57:17.100
How?

03:57:17.100 --> 03:57:19.100
Oh gosh.

03:57:19.100 --> 03:57:21.100
Right, we do that.

03:57:21.100 --> 03:57:23.100
They make money selling the food you cook.

03:57:23.100 --> 03:57:25.100
Oh my God, cooked fish runs?

03:57:27.100 --> 03:57:29.100
It was...

03:57:29.100 --> 03:57:31.100
my non-Iron Man account.

03:57:31.100 --> 03:57:33.100
Ah, since I can't trade on that.

03:57:33.100 --> 03:57:35.100
Oh, is you can prompt? Yeah, I get it.

03:57:35.100 --> 03:57:37.100
I get it.

03:57:37.100 --> 03:57:39.100
Is this an original couple?

03:57:39.100 --> 03:57:41.100
Oh, it's Lou.

03:57:41.100 --> 03:57:43.100
Amy is on her loading screen.

03:57:43.100 --> 03:57:45.100
Who knows what she's doing behind that screen?

03:57:45.100 --> 03:57:47.100
I'd buy food from Strawni.

03:57:47.100 --> 03:57:49.100
Yeah, would you?

03:57:49.100 --> 03:57:51.100
Would you buy my homemade ink?

03:57:51.100 --> 03:57:53.100
Or would you like it?

03:57:53.100 --> 03:57:55.100
Great.

03:57:55.100 --> 03:57:57.100
Right.

03:57:57.100 --> 03:57:59.100
If Amy's on her loading screen,

03:57:59.100 --> 03:58:01.100
mods may you please post

03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:03.100
Emicals is linked.

03:58:03.100 --> 03:58:05.100
And can you guys please interrogate her

03:58:05.100 --> 03:58:07.100
and say is she on RuneScape

03:58:07.100 --> 03:58:09.100
or is someone...

03:58:09.100 --> 03:58:11.100
someone larping as my little sister?

03:58:11.100 --> 03:58:13.100
I want my real little sister.

03:58:13.100 --> 03:58:15.100
Amy's life story...

03:58:15.100 --> 03:58:17.100
That's awful. Who named that?

03:58:17.100 --> 03:58:19.100
I don't know.

03:58:27.100 --> 03:58:29.100
Music's so nice and chill.

03:58:29.100 --> 03:58:31.100
But yes, Amy is going live

03:58:31.100 --> 03:58:33.100
with the coffin of Andy and Laylee.

03:58:33.100 --> 03:58:35.100
It's a bit of a reading simulator, just warning for those.

03:58:37.100 --> 03:58:39.100
Make sure you tell her to hydrate through it

03:58:39.100 --> 03:58:41.100
if she's going to be reading absolutely everything.

03:58:41.100 --> 03:58:43.100
Because, oh my gosh.

03:58:47.100 --> 03:58:49.100
Hmm.

03:58:51.100 --> 03:58:53.100
She said nah.

03:58:55.100 --> 03:58:59.100
Who is larping as my little sister?

03:58:59.100 --> 03:59:01.100
Giving me 25 coins.

03:59:01.100 --> 03:59:03.100
Is that my 20%

03:59:03.100 --> 03:59:05.100
that you gave me?

03:59:07.100 --> 03:59:09.100
What color is the ink?

03:59:09.100 --> 03:59:11.100
It's been described as

03:59:11.100 --> 03:59:13.100
glippy.

03:59:13.100 --> 03:59:15.100
Someone...

03:59:15.100 --> 03:59:17.100
Actually, I said this the other day.

03:59:17.100 --> 03:59:19.100
Whoever said it's like

03:59:19.100 --> 03:59:21.100
a male jar, you're done.

03:59:21.100 --> 03:59:23.100
I don't know who said that.

03:59:23.100 --> 03:59:25.100
Hello reflings!

03:59:25.100 --> 03:59:27.100
Oh, and you really refling joined the fray.

03:59:27.100 --> 03:59:29.100
Yes, we're on World 388

03:59:29.100 --> 03:59:31.100
and we're at the bottom of...

03:59:31.100 --> 03:59:33.100
We're south of Lumberge Castle

03:59:33.100 --> 03:59:35.100
at the mining slash fishing tutorial

03:59:35.100 --> 03:59:37.100
area.

03:59:37.100 --> 03:59:39.100
Or to the east of the swamp

03:59:39.100 --> 03:59:41.100
under Lumberge...

03:59:41.100 --> 03:59:43.100
to Castle.

03:59:43.100 --> 03:59:45.100
If she knows nothing,

03:59:45.100 --> 03:59:47.100
she's going to like it for sure.

03:59:47.100 --> 03:59:49.100
Andy and Lele

03:59:49.100 --> 03:59:51.100
is a mess up game.

03:59:51.100 --> 03:59:53.100
It has very unique story plot.

03:59:53.100 --> 03:59:55.100
Oh, please keep going.

03:59:55.100 --> 03:59:57.100
You cast your net.

03:59:57.100 --> 03:59:59.100
We're almost 20 cooking.

03:59:59.100 --> 04:00:01.100
When we're 20 cooking, we're going to move on

04:00:01.100 --> 04:00:03.100
to the next place.

04:00:03.100 --> 04:00:05.100
Which is Barbarian Village.

04:00:05.100 --> 04:00:07.100
I don't know if there's going to be bot spam in there.

04:00:07.100 --> 04:00:09.100
I could have sworn I came across a religion bot

04:00:09.100 --> 04:00:11.100
before that was spamming.

04:00:11.100 --> 04:00:13.100
And I was like, there is no way

04:00:13.100 --> 04:00:15.100
someone's paying

04:00:15.100 --> 04:00:17.100
for that. It was the most bizarre thing.

04:00:17.100 --> 04:00:19.100
This place

04:00:19.100 --> 04:00:21.100
has got to smell terrobin.

04:00:21.100 --> 04:00:23.100
Literally rotten fish on the floor

04:00:23.100 --> 04:00:25.100
everywhere. Burnt fish, cooked fish.

04:00:25.100 --> 04:00:27.100
Like, the whole

04:00:27.100 --> 04:00:29.100
of Gelenor can smell our operation

04:00:29.100 --> 04:00:31.100
front over here.

04:00:35.100 --> 04:00:37.100
Wah, hydration, hydration, hydration.

04:00:41.100 --> 04:00:43.100
Woof woof

04:00:43.100 --> 04:00:45.100
Woof woof

04:00:45.100 --> 04:00:47.100
How is our fishing level so low?

04:00:47.100 --> 04:00:49.100
What is it?

04:00:49.100 --> 04:00:51.100
Our fishing is 12,

04:00:51.100 --> 04:00:53.100
but our cooking is all the way up at 18.

04:01:01.100 --> 04:01:03.100
They did not have to

04:01:03.100 --> 04:01:05.100
look so hard on the music in this game,

04:01:05.100 --> 04:01:07.100
but so good.

04:01:08.100 --> 04:01:10.100
Oh my god, we're getting flexed on.

04:01:10.100 --> 04:01:12.100
Someone's got a fishing rod.

04:01:15.100 --> 04:01:17.100
Actually getting flexed on, hold on.

04:01:17.100 --> 04:01:19.100
Is that how you pick up anchovies

04:01:19.100 --> 04:01:21.100
by the fishing rod?

04:01:27.100 --> 04:01:29.100
Well, Amy's going to force chat to get her

04:01:29.100 --> 04:01:31.100
down.

04:01:31.100 --> 04:01:33.100
There's only,

04:01:33.100 --> 04:01:35.100
all I'm going to say is there's only one

04:01:35.100 --> 04:01:37.100
way to finish that game.

04:01:37.100 --> 04:01:39.100
There's only one way to finish that game.

04:01:41.100 --> 04:01:43.100
You should work in the seafood business

04:01:43.100 --> 04:01:45.100
on the floor.

04:01:45.100 --> 04:01:47.100
Imagine getting followed by

04:01:47.100 --> 04:01:49.100
Jehovah's Witnesses, even an old school

04:01:49.100 --> 04:01:51.100
runes game, honestly!

04:01:51.100 --> 04:01:53.100
There's bots, like, and it's like,

04:01:53.100 --> 04:01:55.100
why? You get more XP

04:01:55.100 --> 04:01:57.100
for cooking rather than fishing.

04:01:57.100 --> 04:01:59.100
Yeah, there's only one

04:01:59.100 --> 04:02:01.100
real ending to that game.

04:02:01.100 --> 04:02:03.100
And I will accept no other.

04:02:06.100 --> 04:02:08.100
Mmm, any food by

04:02:08.100 --> 04:02:10.100
Strongly Seafood.

04:02:10.100 --> 04:02:12.100
If I see it, I eat it.

04:02:12.100 --> 04:02:14.100
Ooh, that's good, I like that.

04:02:15.100 --> 04:02:17.100
Could I interest you

04:02:17.100 --> 04:02:19.100
in our Lord and Savior? Yeah,

04:02:19.100 --> 04:02:21.100
have you heard of our Lord and Savior, Brian?

04:02:21.100 --> 04:02:23.100
Honestly.

04:02:23.100 --> 04:02:25.100
I think, I can't remember

04:02:25.100 --> 04:02:27.100
if I said this or not. I thought

04:02:27.100 --> 04:02:29.100
they were just shouting out, like, randomly.

04:02:29.100 --> 04:02:31.100
I would just shout, like, the most common, like,

04:02:31.100 --> 04:02:33.100
boy names and, like, a chance

04:02:33.100 --> 04:02:35.100
for someone to hear their name.

04:02:35.100 --> 04:02:37.100
Just play Jack!

04:02:37.100 --> 04:02:39.100
And then we just go back to the gameplay

04:02:39.100 --> 04:02:41.100
and I play Nothing Happened.

04:02:41.100 --> 04:02:43.100
What's another popular boy name?

04:02:43.100 --> 04:02:45.100
I have no idea. Jacob!

04:02:45.100 --> 04:02:47.100
Oh, there we go.

04:02:47.100 --> 04:02:49.100
And then we just go back to the gameplay.

04:02:49.100 --> 04:02:51.100
I play Nothing Happened.

04:02:51.100 --> 04:02:53.100
Just, like, freak out whoever's listening in

04:02:53.100 --> 04:02:55.100
and just be like, oh my god, that's my name.

04:02:55.100 --> 04:02:57.100
I don't know.

04:02:57.100 --> 04:02:59.100
That's popular.

04:02:59.100 --> 04:03:01.100
Okay.

04:03:01.100 --> 04:03:03.100
Little inventory.

04:03:03.100 --> 04:03:05.100
Okay, now you just pin your own...

04:03:05.100 --> 04:03:07.100
Oh, John's the comment.

04:03:07.100 --> 04:03:09.100
John!

04:03:09.100 --> 04:03:11.100
Andrew, wake up!

04:03:13.100 --> 04:03:15.100
Hey.

04:03:15.100 --> 04:03:17.100
Oh, Joseph, there's a lot of J names.

04:03:17.100 --> 04:03:19.100
J-J-J-John.

04:03:19.100 --> 04:03:21.100
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude...

04:03:21.100 --> 04:03:23.100
The fire is tricking me again.

04:03:23.100 --> 04:03:25.100
I don't know.

04:03:25.100 --> 04:03:27.100
I'll see what I can do. I don't know.

04:03:27.100 --> 04:03:29.100
I find it fun, like, kind of trolling a bit like that

04:03:29.100 --> 04:03:31.100
and you just, like, secretly...

04:03:31.100 --> 04:03:33.100
I know! Yeah, see?

04:03:33.100 --> 04:03:35.100
I wanted... I'm actually gonna...

04:03:35.100 --> 04:03:37.100
I'll spoil this.

04:03:37.100 --> 04:03:39.100
I want to do a hypnosis-themed audio

04:03:39.100 --> 04:03:41.100
where I get you to forget

04:03:41.100 --> 04:03:43.100
your name and respond to wefling.

04:03:43.100 --> 04:03:45.100
I think that'd be pretty cool.

04:03:45.100 --> 04:03:47.100
But I will put, like,

04:03:47.100 --> 04:03:50.420
wears off after like 30 minutes type thing.

04:03:50.420 --> 04:03:52.180
I don't want anyone panicking thinking they're,

04:03:52.180 --> 04:03:54.300
they're gonna like pair them up, forget their name.

04:03:54.300 --> 04:03:56.260
If you say Brian three times in front of a mirror,

04:03:56.260 --> 04:03:58.980
you can summon him and he tells us a pun.

04:04:01.380 --> 04:04:02.700
Mmm.

04:04:02.700 --> 04:04:05.260
19, oh, we're so close, we're so close.

04:04:05.260 --> 04:04:09.380
Maybe like one more rack of fish and then we're done.

04:04:09.380 --> 04:04:11.140
If I don't burn any,

04:04:11.140 --> 04:04:13.140
actually they're really starting not to get burnt.

04:04:13.140 --> 04:04:15.300
I'm really happy with that.

04:04:15.300 --> 04:04:16.780
Oh, that's someone cutting down a tree.

04:04:16.780 --> 04:04:17.620
That's what that noise is.

04:04:17.620 --> 04:04:19.180
I just couldn't hear it.

04:04:19.180 --> 04:04:21.060
Ripped to all those with this obscure,

04:04:21.060 --> 04:04:22.620
yeah, like that's the only reason I was like,

04:04:22.620 --> 04:04:24.620
oh, it's probably not that fun for those

04:04:24.620 --> 04:04:27.740
who have like obscure name type thing going on.

04:04:28.740 --> 04:04:30.460
No strong, you make it so it never wears off.

04:04:30.460 --> 04:04:32.620
No, I have to make it wear off.

04:04:33.980 --> 04:04:36.580
I'm not really into perma effect hypnosis.

04:04:36.580 --> 04:04:37.820
It's just not for me.

04:04:38.780 --> 04:04:43.140
Um, rather a bit, a bit scared of it.

04:04:43.140 --> 04:04:44.780
Are you slidding me right now?

04:04:44.780 --> 04:04:46.220
Brian.

04:04:46.220 --> 04:04:47.740
Anakin, start panicking.

04:04:47.740 --> 04:04:49.980
I don't have a planakin.

04:04:49.980 --> 04:04:51.980
Banana, Anakin.

04:04:51.980 --> 04:04:54.460
Thank you for the tip, Iron Weeper.

04:04:54.460 --> 04:04:58.580
There was a really popular meme about Anakin

04:04:58.580 --> 04:05:01.740
and it was like Bananakin and that was the meme.

04:05:01.740 --> 04:05:03.460
And it had everyone in hysterics.

04:05:03.460 --> 04:05:05.660
It had them in a choke hold for years.

04:05:06.660 --> 04:05:09.020
Absolute shawng behavior, shawng.

04:05:10.300 --> 04:05:12.100
Because thanks for the tip.

04:05:12.100 --> 04:05:13.340
Anakin, start panicking.

04:05:13.340 --> 04:05:14.980
I don't have a planakin.

04:05:14.980 --> 04:05:15.820
That sounds like that song.

04:05:15.820 --> 04:05:19.620
Here comes Michael Finnegan.

04:05:19.620 --> 04:05:21.780
He had whiskers on his chin again.

04:05:23.380 --> 04:05:24.780
Sutton, Sutton.

04:05:25.860 --> 04:05:28.420
Back to the begin again.

04:05:28.420 --> 04:05:30.140
Da, da, da, da, da.

04:05:30.140 --> 04:05:31.820
I can never remember.

04:05:32.900 --> 04:05:35.500
The best you're getting at me is twinkle twinkle little star.

04:05:35.500 --> 04:05:37.580
You'll either take it or leave it.

04:05:40.260 --> 04:05:43.020
Maybe Vader some day later.

04:05:43.020 --> 04:05:44.380
Oh, I don't remember that part.

04:05:44.420 --> 04:05:46.500
I remember the Yoda song where it goes like.

04:05:47.500 --> 04:05:49.220
Oh, someone dropped a party hat.

04:05:49.220 --> 04:05:51.060
Oh, we can put.

04:05:51.060 --> 04:05:52.140
Oh, I've got my chef's hat.

04:05:52.140 --> 04:05:53.100
Look, reflings.

04:05:53.100 --> 04:05:53.940
Look, look, look.

04:05:53.940 --> 04:05:55.940
There's party hats if you want to put them on

04:05:55.940 --> 04:05:57.620
because it's a party.

04:05:57.620 --> 04:06:00.140
Oh, look at the box coming over from the main.

04:06:00.140 --> 04:06:01.500
Look.

04:06:01.500 --> 04:06:02.740
Oh, there's a Santa hat.

04:06:02.740 --> 04:06:04.980
There's a red party hat.

04:06:04.980 --> 04:06:06.700
There's a white party hat.

04:06:06.700 --> 04:06:08.420
Ooh.

04:06:08.420 --> 04:06:09.820
And there's burnt fish.

04:06:09.820 --> 04:06:11.900
Oh, there's one over there and there's a Santa hat.

04:06:12.100 --> 04:06:13.260
Ready?

04:06:13.260 --> 04:06:14.100
Whoa.

04:06:15.620 --> 04:06:17.260
Thank you to ever drop them.

04:06:17.260 --> 04:06:19.500
Oh, look, you're opening your party hats on.

04:06:19.500 --> 04:06:20.500
Look at your party.

04:06:22.820 --> 04:06:25.700
It's a party in the south of Lumbridge.

04:06:25.700 --> 04:06:26.540
Yeah.

04:06:28.500 --> 04:06:29.540
The little party hat.

04:06:29.540 --> 04:06:30.540
Oh, look at you.

04:06:30.540 --> 04:06:31.860
Go.

04:06:31.860 --> 04:06:33.740
Go get your fancy party hats.

04:06:33.740 --> 04:06:34.580
Look at yours.

04:06:36.860 --> 04:06:38.300
What's up, party people?

04:06:39.060 --> 04:06:39.900
Go.

04:06:41.380 --> 04:06:43.260
Can we ask the chat to speak German?

04:06:43.260 --> 04:06:47.260
I don't know if the bot filters are non-English words

04:06:47.260 --> 04:06:49.180
because I've said it up as an English thing.

04:06:49.180 --> 04:06:51.820
Why can't Mickey Mouse flying his plane to Scotland

04:06:53.500 --> 04:06:54.900
at Disneyland?

04:06:59.740 --> 04:07:00.980
You didn't know.

04:07:00.980 --> 04:07:03.180
Just say it does not in Scots.

04:07:03.180 --> 04:07:05.820
You say it does me.

04:07:05.820 --> 04:07:06.820
I don't know why.

04:07:07.820 --> 04:07:10.380
If I have to explain the joke because of flying,

04:07:10.380 --> 04:07:12.420
how are Santa hats 16K?

04:07:12.420 --> 04:07:13.740
I don't know.

04:07:13.740 --> 04:07:16.060
Can't speak German and can't speak Dutch.

04:07:16.060 --> 04:07:17.540
OK.

04:07:17.540 --> 04:07:19.100
These puns were not I wanted.

04:07:19.100 --> 04:07:21.180
I need a refund.

04:07:25.860 --> 04:07:26.900
He, he, he.

04:07:26.900 --> 04:07:28.220
That was good, actually.

04:07:28.220 --> 04:07:29.060
I'll give you that one.

04:07:29.060 --> 04:07:30.060
I'm giving you that one.

04:07:30.980 --> 04:07:35.980
Yeah, I don't know what the bot does and doesn't like

04:07:38.580 --> 04:07:40.940
in terms of TTS at the moment.

04:07:40.940 --> 04:07:42.660
OK, we're definitely fishing a lot.

04:07:44.740 --> 04:07:48.860
Where is my refling for sexy fire making?

04:07:50.660 --> 04:07:52.460
I would like to summon one fire please.

04:07:52.460 --> 04:07:54.260
I'm going to dance until the fire appears.

04:07:54.260 --> 04:07:55.100
OK, let's dance.

04:07:55.100 --> 04:07:57.340
Hey, hit him with the spin, hit him with the spin.

04:07:57.340 --> 04:07:59.820
Hey, little Irish jig.

04:08:00.820 --> 04:08:02.460
Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop.

04:08:02.460 --> 04:08:03.300
Head back.

04:08:03.300 --> 04:08:06.700
Hey, hey, hey, get him with the yawn.

04:08:06.700 --> 04:08:09.140
That does not look like a yawn.

04:08:09.140 --> 04:08:09.980
Yeah, really?

04:08:09.980 --> 04:08:12.820
Strongy, you are my leader, Schmetterling.

04:08:12.820 --> 04:08:17.580
Leader Schmetterling, but is Schmetterling in English?

04:08:17.580 --> 04:08:18.580
What is Schmetterling?

04:08:18.580 --> 04:08:19.940
Is that called fishing?

04:08:19.940 --> 04:08:21.460
Is that called fishing German?

04:08:21.460 --> 04:08:22.300
Is that what it means?

04:08:22.300 --> 04:08:23.900
Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaper.

04:08:25.940 --> 04:08:26.940
A butterfly.

04:08:26.940 --> 04:08:28.940
Hi, hi, hi.

04:08:28.940 --> 04:08:31.260
I'm here to the butterfly.

04:08:31.260 --> 04:08:33.180
Please make a move.

04:08:33.180 --> 04:08:35.860
Put the colors in the sky.

04:08:35.860 --> 04:08:37.340
Ah, hee, hee, hee.

04:08:37.340 --> 04:08:38.060
Where's fire?

04:08:38.060 --> 04:08:39.060
Right, I'll go get a fire.

04:08:39.060 --> 04:08:39.620
Don't worry, guys.

04:08:39.620 --> 04:08:41.460
I'm on the fire.

04:08:41.460 --> 04:08:42.740
Oh, wait, I found the fire.

04:08:42.740 --> 04:08:43.260
I'm blind.

04:08:43.260 --> 04:08:43.820
I'm just blind.

04:08:43.820 --> 04:08:44.780
I need my glasses on.

04:08:44.780 --> 04:08:45.940
Sorry.

04:08:45.940 --> 04:08:47.900
Sorry, there's a fire down here.

04:08:47.900 --> 04:08:49.740
Sorry.

04:08:49.740 --> 04:08:51.220
Hey, strongy, do you have a party hat?

04:08:51.220 --> 04:08:52.460
I have an extra one.

04:08:52.460 --> 04:08:58.900
I have, sorry, to, you know, kind of flex on the peasants,

04:08:58.900 --> 04:09:05.020
but on my head is gold in crusted chef's hat.

04:09:05.020 --> 04:09:07.620
I must stick to my gold in crusted chef's hat.

04:09:07.620 --> 04:09:09.620
Thank you very much for your offer.

04:09:09.620 --> 04:09:10.380
Super kind.

04:09:10.380 --> 04:09:12.820
You know, I don't want to flex on them peasants below me,

04:09:12.820 --> 04:09:20.420
but I'm kind of styling with the combo of gold apron and gold hat.

04:09:20.420 --> 04:09:22.260
Wouldn't be super awesome if the player entered

04:09:22.260 --> 04:09:26.260
the group and discovered the shroom thingy to come here.

04:09:26.260 --> 04:09:28.940
If I play, oh, like someone just joins along.

04:09:28.940 --> 04:09:32.380
Well, I don't know if you're, we told some, they were like,

04:09:32.380 --> 04:09:33.180
what's going on?

04:09:33.180 --> 04:09:35.420
And I was like, oh, some cringe VTuber's shroom in.

04:09:35.420 --> 04:09:37.220
And they were like, I'm world hopping.

04:09:37.220 --> 04:09:38.940
And I was like, OK, thanks for announcing it.

04:09:38.940 --> 04:09:41.700
Literally, no one cares, thanks.

04:09:41.700 --> 04:09:46.980
Am I level, am I level 19 still?

04:09:46.980 --> 04:09:50.940
I am like two fishies away from 20.

04:09:50.940 --> 04:09:53.900
And then we're going to move to Barbarian Village,

04:09:53.900 --> 04:09:56.940
which is west of the Grand Exchange.

04:09:56.940 --> 04:10:00.460
Strona has power to actually do it in crusted chef's hat.

04:10:00.460 --> 04:10:02.260
Weird flex.

04:10:02.260 --> 04:10:03.700
That happened to me in Final Fantasy.

04:10:03.700 --> 04:10:05.060
Our Marshmallow is anonymous.

04:10:05.060 --> 04:10:07.220
Yes.

04:10:07.220 --> 04:10:10.740
If you have Firefox, it might be able to translate the screen

04:10:10.740 --> 04:10:11.620
automatically.

04:10:11.620 --> 04:10:16.620
Sometimes it doesn't, I don't know why.

04:10:16.620 --> 04:10:21.420
I am going to make another cup of tea.

04:10:21.420 --> 04:10:22.740
Hop on strunnies.

04:10:26.740 --> 04:10:29.300
I'm going to make another cup of tea,

04:10:29.300 --> 04:10:31.540
because my voice is absolutely feeling it.

04:10:31.540 --> 04:10:34.980
What do you mean doing multiple 12-hour streams back to back

04:10:34.980 --> 04:10:36.340
is straining on the throat?

04:10:36.340 --> 04:10:38.300
Oh, it says 10.

04:10:38.300 --> 04:10:42.220
Is that like a RuneScape, like Congrats 10 Balloon?

04:10:42.220 --> 04:10:43.100
I saw that.

04:10:43.100 --> 04:10:44.780
Wait, hold on, let me make the, look.

04:10:44.780 --> 04:10:47.180
Oh my god, he's getting performance anxiety making that

04:10:47.180 --> 04:10:47.700
fire.

04:10:47.700 --> 04:10:49.500
Look, it's a 10.

04:10:49.500 --> 04:10:50.860
He must have got it for 10.

04:10:50.860 --> 04:10:52.500
Oh, you don't look at your shirt.

04:10:52.500 --> 04:10:56.260
What is, it's like the logo.

04:10:56.260 --> 04:10:58.380
Let me zoom out a little bit.

04:10:58.380 --> 04:10:59.660
It was the 10th anniversary.

04:10:59.660 --> 04:11:00.700
How old is this game?

04:11:05.260 --> 04:11:06.580
There's too many people.

04:11:09.420 --> 04:11:10.260
Another cup of tea.

04:11:10.260 --> 04:11:14.380
You mean a cup of tea for the non-endurance stream, right?

04:11:14.420 --> 04:11:17.660
Yeah, surely, as I say, on the four-hour mark,

04:11:17.660 --> 04:11:20.180
and we're not even like level 20 in cooking.

04:11:20.180 --> 04:11:22.300
Yeah, not an endurance stream at all.

04:11:25.420 --> 04:11:28.180
Google Chrome apparently translates Marshmallow as well.

04:11:28.180 --> 04:11:30.820
But now if I send the Marshmallow, you'll know it's me.

04:11:30.820 --> 04:11:35.220
No, actually, because I'm not opening them up right now.

04:11:35.220 --> 04:11:39.460
And for some reason, Marshmallow puts like five questions

04:11:39.460 --> 04:11:42.380
from like loads of different times together at once.

04:11:42.420 --> 04:11:43.540
It doesn't make any sense.

04:11:43.540 --> 04:11:44.620
I don't know why I'd pass it.

04:11:49.340 --> 04:11:51.340
Send the most horrendous cringe Marshmallow

04:11:51.340 --> 04:11:53.660
and sign your name on the bottom like a gigatad.

04:11:53.660 --> 04:11:57.540
I played when I was five on my older brother's account.

04:11:57.540 --> 04:11:59.780
Oh, did he like force you to go questing?

04:11:59.780 --> 04:12:01.100
That's funniest, anything.

04:12:03.540 --> 04:12:05.620
This isn't RuneScape, huh?

04:12:08.620 --> 04:12:10.660
It's old-school RuneScape.

04:12:11.540 --> 04:12:12.820
Oh, no.

04:12:12.820 --> 04:12:14.300
We're getting corrections.

04:12:15.980 --> 04:12:20.980
Oh, wow, doing bot run on your brother's account.

04:12:21.220 --> 04:12:22.060
For him.

04:12:24.540 --> 04:12:26.060
Oh, I said RuneScape twice in the same sentence.

04:12:26.060 --> 04:12:26.900
Oh, my God, cringe.

04:12:27.860 --> 04:12:28.700
It's a cringe.

04:12:28.700 --> 04:12:29.540
See about here.

04:12:31.300 --> 04:12:33.100
You're in a level 14 fishing.

04:12:33.100 --> 04:12:34.700
I mean, we're getting somewhere.

04:12:36.460 --> 04:12:39.140
Oh, no, I think I might need PP bye-bye time as well.

04:12:39.220 --> 04:12:41.660
Actually, yeah, a T and a P might.

04:12:43.100 --> 04:12:46.900
But not the P and the P, but I need a P and a P in general.

04:12:51.940 --> 04:12:55.540
Key quest is how often are these old-school rooms?

04:12:55.540 --> 04:12:57.820
I was gonna do a few endurance streams.

04:12:57.820 --> 04:13:00.980
I have no idea how long cooking takes.

04:13:01.980 --> 04:13:04.180
So I was gonna do a few endurance streams of it.

04:13:04.180 --> 04:13:06.140
I was gonna try and finish it in one month,

04:13:06.140 --> 04:13:10.620
but I don't know if that's just being far too crazy.

04:13:10.620 --> 04:13:13.660
Cut off fish, wrapper needs a T and a P.

04:13:18.300 --> 04:13:21.500
On RuneScape, with a refunds, ptsu.

04:13:21.500 --> 04:13:24.860
Doing nothing, ptsu, hunting for shrimp.

04:13:24.860 --> 04:13:27.180
I can't rhyme, I can't do it.

04:13:27.180 --> 04:13:29.580
I don't know how people do it at the same time.

04:13:30.860 --> 04:13:33.660
You can reason why they get 9-9 cooking in less than 30 hours.

04:13:33.660 --> 04:13:35.860
Okay, no, currently we're not maxing,

04:13:35.860 --> 04:13:37.460
but I'll do, I'll do.

04:13:38.340 --> 04:13:39.660
I'm gonna do that.

04:13:44.740 --> 04:13:46.580
We did it!

04:13:46.580 --> 04:13:49.140
30 hours of one tick-clicking.

04:13:49.140 --> 04:13:52.180
Level 20 cooking.

04:13:52.180 --> 04:13:54.060
Do we still burn shrimp on 20?

04:13:55.100 --> 04:13:58.420
With Karab one.

04:13:58.420 --> 04:13:59.820
Karab one's a real thing.

04:14:01.020 --> 04:14:02.460
Am I being pranked?

04:14:02.460 --> 04:14:05.060
I don't think you burn after level 20!

04:14:06.740 --> 04:14:08.660
A reefling check.

04:14:08.660 --> 04:14:10.740
For those of you who are on a fresh account,

04:14:10.740 --> 04:14:12.100
what level are we looking at?

04:14:12.100 --> 04:14:13.620
20 as well?

04:14:13.620 --> 04:14:14.580
You guys, 20?

04:14:15.940 --> 04:14:18.740
Karambuaz.

04:14:18.740 --> 04:14:21.460
Oh, she sees, okay, you're done.

04:14:24.500 --> 04:14:26.580
I've got 21, I've got 23.

04:14:26.580 --> 04:14:27.940
How are you all faster than me?

04:14:27.940 --> 04:14:29.860
Okay, we'll go a little reefling.

04:14:31.220 --> 04:14:35.060
Okay, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a P and a T,

04:14:35.060 --> 04:14:35.900
a classic.

04:14:38.020 --> 04:14:40.660
And we will be back.

04:14:40.660 --> 04:14:42.100
Hi, how's the runescaping?

04:14:42.100 --> 04:14:43.460
We're doing good!

04:14:43.460 --> 04:14:44.660
If you ever wanted to join in,

04:14:44.660 --> 04:14:47.060
we're on World 3A top right there.

04:14:48.100 --> 04:14:50.100
Why is my latest tipper not working?

04:14:50.100 --> 04:14:51.620
It should be rotating right now.

04:14:53.220 --> 04:14:54.660
Sorry, latest tipper.

04:14:58.180 --> 04:15:01.460
And then we're gonna move to Barbarian Village next

04:15:01.460 --> 04:15:03.140
and we're gonna see what happens.

04:15:03.140 --> 04:15:03.780
If there's...

04:15:04.900 --> 04:15:05.940
Oh wait, no, we can't!

04:15:10.260 --> 04:15:14.820
The problem is I don't want to mute the in-game chat

04:15:14.820 --> 04:15:15.700
because of the bots.

04:15:17.060 --> 04:15:18.900
I'm gonna go to bed, have fun cooking.

04:15:18.900 --> 04:15:20.980
Ah well, thank you for everything.

04:15:20.980 --> 04:15:24.020
Thank you for the extortionate prices,

04:15:24.020 --> 04:15:25.780
for the shearers and all that.

04:15:28.420 --> 04:15:32.740
I just realized we would probably have to fly fish

04:15:33.140 --> 04:15:34.100
the fish ourselves.

04:15:35.780 --> 04:15:38.260
Unless we went to the Grand Exchange,

04:15:38.260 --> 04:15:40.980
but only I have accessed all the fish in my inventory

04:15:40.980 --> 04:15:42.740
so it's not like we can share it out equally.

04:15:46.260 --> 04:15:48.740
The bots on this world won't speak.

04:15:48.740 --> 04:15:50.580
I mean, I can't, I just ignore them.

04:15:51.620 --> 04:15:53.220
If we have to fly fish,

04:15:53.220 --> 04:15:56.260
I think we need like level 20 fishing

04:15:56.260 --> 04:15:58.020
so we would be here for a bit longer.

04:15:58.580 --> 04:16:03.380
But rest well, there's reeflings that do need to sleep.

04:16:03.380 --> 04:16:05.940
Yeah, we would need 20 for the trout.

04:16:08.340 --> 04:16:10.100
Oh, sorry, I just like...

04:16:10.100 --> 04:16:12.820
We need fish and wane.

04:16:12.820 --> 04:16:13.940
Maybe we should pray.

04:16:16.180 --> 04:16:17.540
But how can fish fly?

04:16:17.540 --> 04:16:18.900
Are you telling me this fish flies?

04:16:25.700 --> 04:16:27.220
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

04:16:28.100 --> 04:16:30.580
I'm not sure you guys want to be held here for another...

04:16:31.940 --> 04:16:35.140
what hour until we get like the actual level needed.

04:16:37.940 --> 04:16:40.980
I'm thinking, but my brain isn't really coming up with any solutions.

04:16:40.980 --> 04:16:41.620
It's either...

04:16:43.700 --> 04:16:44.820
Nah, there is no solution.

04:16:44.820 --> 04:16:47.460
We have to keep being here until level 20 fishing.

04:16:50.340 --> 04:16:51.540
And then we can move on.

04:16:51.540 --> 04:16:52.900
It's going to be a long road either.

04:16:52.900 --> 04:16:55.940
Well, yeah, literally if it takes 30 hours of matter,

04:16:56.900 --> 04:16:59.940
like, are you telling me I shouldn't pray this fish?

04:16:59.940 --> 04:17:01.860
Are you telling me I've cuddled this fish?

04:17:01.860 --> 04:17:02.340
Yeah.

04:17:02.340 --> 04:17:06.260
Um, if it's going to be a 30 hour stream anyway,

04:17:06.260 --> 04:17:07.380
congrats on 20.

04:17:08.660 --> 04:17:10.980
No questing for hourly levels suck.

04:17:12.820 --> 04:17:16.820
Yeah, we're also pretty low on combat for fresh starts as well,

04:17:16.820 --> 04:17:17.460
which is a bit...

04:17:19.860 --> 04:17:22.340
And I don't know what we should do.

04:17:23.460 --> 04:17:25.620
Are you telling me I cuddled this fish?

04:17:25.620 --> 04:17:26.260
Exactly.

04:17:27.380 --> 04:17:28.260
You can do...

04:17:30.580 --> 04:17:32.100
Miss the mystery well here.

04:17:32.100 --> 04:17:33.540
That quest is right here.

04:17:33.540 --> 04:17:34.980
Oh, do we need...

04:17:35.860 --> 04:17:37.380
Okay, how about that?

04:17:37.380 --> 04:17:40.100
We go for a T and a P and we're gonna do some more questing

04:17:40.100 --> 04:17:42.020
just to break up the fishing,

04:17:42.020 --> 04:17:44.660
because that was quite a few levels we got with fishing.

04:17:44.660 --> 04:17:46.180
So we'll go do some questing.

04:17:47.540 --> 04:17:51.060
Um, and then it can be broken up a little bit,

04:17:51.060 --> 04:17:52.740
because I don't want to like hurt you too much,

04:17:53.380 --> 04:17:54.580
just doing it over and over.

04:17:55.620 --> 04:17:58.420
Oh no, you mean we have to stay here and keep chatting forever?

04:17:58.420 --> 04:17:59.300
I would hate that.

04:17:59.300 --> 04:17:59.940
Oh, wow.

04:17:59.940 --> 04:18:00.820
Oh, that would suck.

04:18:00.820 --> 04:18:01.620
Yeah.

04:18:01.620 --> 04:18:02.340
I'm glad.

04:18:02.340 --> 04:18:04.020
I'm glad you enjoy my rambles.

04:18:05.060 --> 04:18:06.580
But just as a reminder,

04:18:06.580 --> 04:18:11.780
Emmy is live playing the coffin of Andy.

04:18:11.780 --> 04:18:14.020
Congrats if your name's Andy and Lele.

04:18:14.020 --> 04:18:15.940
Congrats if your name's Ashley or Lele.

04:18:15.940 --> 04:18:17.620
Nickname is a Lele.

04:18:17.620 --> 04:18:22.340
Um, then we are going to do a few more quests,

04:18:22.340 --> 04:18:24.340
free quests just to break it up a little bit,

04:18:24.340 --> 04:18:28.740
because I don't want you guys being bored of it or not.

04:18:28.740 --> 04:18:31.380
But we will start the cooking grind soon.

04:18:32.260 --> 04:18:33.060
Another 10?

04:18:33.060 --> 04:18:35.220
The German name for cuttlefish is Tin Tin Fish.

04:18:36.500 --> 04:18:38.740
A Tin Tin Fish?

04:18:39.700 --> 04:18:40.820
A Tin Tin Fish?

04:18:41.620 --> 04:18:42.660
Oh my gosh.

04:18:42.660 --> 04:18:43.300
Okay.

04:18:43.300 --> 04:18:44.820
Thank you for the tip, Iron Reaper.

04:18:45.700 --> 04:18:49.140
The German name for cuttlefish is Tin Tin Fish.

04:18:49.140 --> 04:18:51.060
How do I do it in a German at Haloloitad?

04:18:51.780 --> 04:18:52.820
A Tin Tin Fish?

04:18:53.620 --> 04:18:55.140
A Tin Tin Fish?

04:18:55.140 --> 04:18:56.580
I can't do it.

04:18:56.580 --> 04:18:57.620
I can't do it.

04:18:58.420 --> 04:19:01.060
I can't break it.

04:19:01.060 --> 04:19:01.620
Nine.

04:19:02.980 --> 04:19:04.100
A Tin Tin Fish.

04:19:04.100 --> 04:19:05.620
I am a big Tin Tin Fish.

04:19:07.620 --> 04:19:08.660
I'm level.

04:19:08.660 --> 04:19:09.540
Congratulations.

04:19:09.540 --> 04:19:11.540
You reach a total level of 75.

04:19:11.540 --> 04:19:15.220
Oh, I'm flexing on other RuneScape players right now with that.

04:19:15.220 --> 04:19:15.940
Flexing.

04:19:18.340 --> 04:19:20.660
Tin Tin Fish equals an ink fish.

04:19:21.300 --> 04:19:22.900
Oh, that's such a cool translation.

04:19:22.900 --> 04:19:23.700
So Tin Tin.

04:19:24.500 --> 04:19:26.820
Tin as in tint of a color.

04:19:29.060 --> 04:19:30.580
And it's ink tin.

04:19:30.580 --> 04:19:32.180
And so it means tinted fish.

04:19:32.980 --> 04:19:34.340
The tint of the ink.

04:19:34.340 --> 04:19:35.060
Oh, that's so cool.

04:19:37.540 --> 04:19:38.900
Wah, why did I stop cooking?

04:19:40.500 --> 04:19:42.900
I wish I was that high level, sad face.

04:19:43.780 --> 04:19:44.900
He says no one feel well.

04:19:44.900 --> 04:19:47.300
He's probably billions of levels higher than us.

04:19:48.980 --> 04:19:49.700
Tin Tin Ink.

04:19:50.660 --> 04:19:51.700
Oh, my God.

04:19:59.780 --> 04:20:00.100
Okay.

04:20:01.220 --> 04:20:04.660
I am going to go make a tea and pee whilst I fish.

04:20:05.620 --> 04:20:07.940
Hopefully this fishing spot doesn't despawn.

04:20:07.940 --> 04:20:09.300
And then we're going to do a quest.

04:20:09.300 --> 04:20:09.540
Okay.

04:20:09.540 --> 04:20:11.780
So I'll be back in like three minutes now.

04:20:11.780 --> 04:20:12.100
Okay.

04:20:12.660 --> 04:20:14.020
Give me three, three.

04:20:14.020 --> 04:20:14.980
Oh, excuse me.

04:20:14.980 --> 04:20:16.660
That was a McDonald's bag from yesterday.

04:20:16.660 --> 04:20:18.740
I do apologize if you heard that picked up in mic.

04:20:19.220 --> 04:20:20.420
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

04:20:20.420 --> 04:20:20.740
Okay.

04:20:20.740 --> 04:20:21.300
I'll be right back.

04:20:21.300 --> 04:20:22.180
I'll be three minutes.

04:20:22.180 --> 04:20:22.740
Pea and a tea.

04:20:22.740 --> 04:20:26.420
Please get up and stretch and get some water or hydration or anything.

04:20:26.420 --> 04:20:27.860
Of course that freaking despawns.

04:20:27.860 --> 04:20:28.500
How dare you.

04:20:29.380 --> 04:20:31.860
Disrespect I've been shown by this fishing spot.

04:20:33.220 --> 04:20:34.740
You got Mickey D's yesterday.

04:20:34.740 --> 04:20:35.780
Well, okay.

04:20:35.780 --> 04:20:36.020
Right.

04:20:36.020 --> 04:20:36.820
I very quickly go.

04:20:36.820 --> 04:20:38.100
I'll be as quick as I can.

04:20:38.100 --> 04:20:38.340
Okay.

04:20:39.460 --> 04:20:41.300
Wait, do I need to cover the screen?

04:20:41.300 --> 04:20:41.860
I don't know.

04:20:41.860 --> 04:20:44.180
I don't think I have to, but yeah.

04:20:45.060 --> 04:20:45.940
Just in case.

04:20:45.940 --> 04:20:47.060
So you see my email.

04:20:49.540 --> 04:20:50.340
I'll be three minutes.

04:20:50.340 --> 04:20:50.580
Okay.

04:20:50.580 --> 04:20:50.740
I was.

04:26:49.700 --> 04:26:54.500
Hey.

04:26:54.500 --> 04:27:00.660
Why?

04:27:00.660 --> 04:27:05.300
My throat hurts so much.

04:27:05.780 --> 04:27:06.100
Okay.

04:27:06.660 --> 04:27:08.340
I can do too long when I go.

04:27:10.820 --> 04:27:11.380
Pee, pee.

04:27:11.380 --> 04:27:11.620
Wait.

04:27:11.620 --> 04:27:12.500
Why he's greeting.

04:27:14.220 --> 04:27:16.260
Wait, what do you mean disconnected?

04:27:16.260 --> 04:27:17.620
I'm not disconnected.

04:27:17.620 --> 04:27:19.620
Wait, why are you greeting? What are you saying?

04:27:20.960 --> 04:27:25.900
She loves us. What? I never said that, didn't I? Because I went for a Tinko.

04:27:27.340 --> 04:27:29.340
You have 30 days.

04:27:29.860 --> 04:27:34.820
She's back. Quick, hide the memes. What were you doing while I was away? I've been away for a few minutes.

04:27:35.980 --> 04:27:42.260
How was the pee? It was not a lot of liquid again, and I've literally finished a bowl of water.

04:27:42.740 --> 04:27:47.380
So, and I had a tea, and I finished a can of cola. I've got another bottle of water here.

04:27:47.380 --> 04:27:50.740
I don't know if you can hear my nails kind of against it.

04:27:50.940 --> 04:27:54.500
I'm gonna try and finish that and the tea. I'm not really sure what's going on.

04:27:56.820 --> 04:28:01.420
Um, I'm being pranked. I've been pranked by my body.

04:28:02.140 --> 04:28:05.420
Wait, why does someone say she doesn't love us? Heart eyes? What?

04:28:07.780 --> 04:28:09.780
By the way, reeflings are the best.

04:28:10.660 --> 04:28:17.740
You say Coca-Cola. I hear burps. Cola burps. Cola burps. We did kiss the homies.

04:28:18.260 --> 04:28:24.380
Uh, don't tell Amy that. She'll be jealous. I'm freaking, wait, I just caught an anchovy.

04:28:25.140 --> 04:28:27.140
What does it do?

04:28:28.980 --> 04:28:31.940
Oh, wait, I'm now catching anchovy because I'm a level?

04:28:33.140 --> 04:28:37.740
Oh, maybe that'll speed up the fishing level gain. Okay, I didn't know that.

04:28:39.940 --> 04:28:44.900
You put anchovies on a pizza. I don't think I've ever tasted that before. Burps.

04:28:45.540 --> 04:28:51.300
Oh, I was so proud when Shabee started burping in her streams. I was like, oh my god.

04:28:52.420 --> 04:28:54.580
My literal daughter. Oh my god.

04:28:55.940 --> 04:29:01.300
With all the tea she drinks, Johnny will be really so fish-ticated.

04:29:05.780 --> 04:29:07.780
That's not bad.

04:29:08.020 --> 04:29:10.020
The burps are hot.

04:29:11.460 --> 04:29:17.700
I don't understand the appeal of it, but then someone said, think of it about after the aftermath.

04:29:20.100 --> 04:29:24.820
Give your run air back, I have no idea.

04:29:27.860 --> 04:29:31.380
We get to rate more mouth pranks. Mouth pranks?

04:29:32.340 --> 04:29:38.020
Why do you keep on firing as I knew that's why there's a freaking fire?

04:29:39.060 --> 04:29:43.460
I'm getting pranked by the spine. Oh, I'm still burning stuff. I'm not level.

04:29:43.460 --> 04:29:47.940
I'm, yeah, literally cooking level 22 and I'm still burning.

04:29:48.740 --> 04:29:52.900
That's pretty rough after the mess. It's taking us a hot second.

04:29:54.260 --> 04:29:59.540
Right, so what fishing level do we need? We need fishing level 20.

04:30:02.340 --> 04:30:07.300
Shabee made a burp speed. She's indeed Shiba-kana-bama. Exactly. That's what I thought.

04:30:09.300 --> 04:30:12.180
Tea bag in the fire. It's Johnny I kneel.

04:30:13.060 --> 04:30:16.020
I guess so many things like, oh, I kneel for all the choices.

04:30:16.900 --> 04:30:22.100
The barbed village spot has a permanent fire to cook on. Oh, right. I'll put my tinderbox and axe away.

04:30:23.940 --> 04:30:26.980
And then we will buy fishing gear.

04:30:27.700 --> 04:30:35.140
We farm until 20 fishing. I didn't know that. Yeah, we're going to do 20 fishing and then we're going to buy rods

04:30:36.020 --> 04:30:38.180
because some of us don't have that attachment.

04:30:38.900 --> 04:30:46.180
And then we get to go to a barbarian village and we fish and we just keep doing that for a while.

04:30:46.900 --> 04:30:54.020
I think maybe we could get 40 doing that because salmon. However, the problem is the cost of feathers,

04:30:54.100 --> 04:30:59.700
but the problem's already been solved thanks to reeflings literally giving me an insane amount of in-game currency.

04:31:00.500 --> 04:31:07.860
Um, oh no, we're doing a quest. I completely forgot. I apologize. We are fishing level 20 fishing

04:31:07.860 --> 04:31:11.620
and then we're going to do a quest that's right here that begins with M. We're going to do maybe

04:31:11.620 --> 04:31:16.180
three quests just to break up the little fishing segment a little bit. It's called

04:31:16.260 --> 04:31:24.740
Mithylin mystery. Mithylin mystery. Burps are saying you have relaxed come from around someone. I am

04:31:26.660 --> 04:31:30.420
some people like get taught it's really rude manners. Like obviously it's rude like you wouldn't

04:31:30.420 --> 04:31:37.380
be in a job interview and burp in there. Actually, speaking of burping in job interviews, I'm like

04:31:37.380 --> 04:31:42.820
90% sure I accidentally burped when I was interviewing one of the girls revealer now that I think about it.

04:31:43.700 --> 04:31:49.540
Uh, absolutely mortified on it. I think it may have been in me. You know that. No, it could not

04:31:49.540 --> 04:31:54.580
have been in me. I think it may have been Mercy. Someone I burped and I was like, oh my god, I'm so sorry.

04:32:00.260 --> 04:32:03.140
Did you hear about the telling chef who died? He passed away.

04:32:03.460 --> 04:32:09.140
Oh, that didn't go that didn't go down well.

04:32:11.540 --> 04:32:18.580
32. I think to stop burping burning shrimp level 32 you stop burning shrimp. That's insane.

04:32:18.580 --> 04:32:25.460
Brian, Stroney, I hope you're proud. I was reading a comic earlier and all I heard was your voice.

04:32:25.540 --> 04:32:31.700
I'm so cooked. Are you? Oh, did that actually happen? Am I in your head? Thank you.

04:32:33.860 --> 04:32:36.500
Am I in your head? Is my accent in your head?

04:32:49.220 --> 04:32:54.260
Okay, hopefully that hypnosis that reverbs off on the mic because I actually don't I didn't

04:32:54.260 --> 04:32:56.020
say a thing that tells me if it's on or not.

04:33:00.100 --> 04:33:07.140
Always in your head. Soon world domination, soon the first 99 cooking, okay.

04:33:08.340 --> 04:33:10.820
It's more attractive if someone doesn't care about it.

04:33:13.540 --> 04:33:21.860
Giving my woods the third group. What? Who? Who is Riefling is this? Come get your Riefling.

04:33:22.420 --> 04:33:27.700
You've been in my head for a long time, Stroney. Cryo Freeze Momentum.

04:33:28.580 --> 04:33:32.660
See, Stroney, that's why I didn't want the undo button. I want an undo button.

04:33:33.300 --> 04:33:39.380
Right, I'm definitely cooking fish a heck of a lot faster now. Catching fish, my apologies.

04:33:40.260 --> 04:33:42.260
She's not cooking.

04:33:50.580 --> 04:33:59.380
We need to video game OST ranking. Okay, that slightly slows down progress now that we're

04:33:59.380 --> 04:34:05.300
also getting anchovies as well. I keep actually trying to use fish on people. I've literally

04:34:05.380 --> 04:34:09.700
slapped so many Rieflings with shrimp right now and feel really bad.

04:34:10.740 --> 04:34:15.060
People are like touching your legs with my shrimp. I'm like, please take my raw shrimp.

04:34:15.060 --> 04:34:20.980
At 21, I can finally churn cream, but we all churn cream together at the same time.

04:34:26.820 --> 04:34:33.300
If you look at it, it's kind of like a cute little fishing camp, so Riefling's on.

04:34:35.540 --> 04:34:45.140
There's a place to churn cream and lump. Wait, we can actually do it?

04:34:47.140 --> 04:34:51.460
Hey, I thought we had to wait for another set for doing that. Honestly, right by Farmer

04:34:51.940 --> 04:34:55.700
I don't even know you can churn, but take it. Take my raw shrimp.

04:35:06.020 --> 04:35:10.820
I'm really happy that you said you love Germany. It's the first time we've worn something.

04:35:11.780 --> 04:35:19.220
Deutschland Uber alles! Deutschland Uber alles! There you go. That's like all the German I could

04:35:19.220 --> 04:35:23.540
come up with. Just Deutschland Uber alles. Thank you for the tip ironing river.

04:35:25.940 --> 04:35:31.940
Wait, I don't know why. Nope, that wasn't it. Don't do that again. Why?

04:35:36.020 --> 04:35:38.900
Hold on. I'm going to try and I don't know why it doesn't like that.

04:35:39.380 --> 04:35:42.180
I don't know why it's frozen.

04:35:46.900 --> 04:35:50.900
I'm so sorry. My little scroll and don't know things frozen. I'm gonna have to fix that next thing.

04:35:52.100 --> 04:35:55.700
Well, no way you can say that. Wait, what does Deutschland Uber alles means?

04:35:56.980 --> 04:36:00.500
Wait, if I just said something really bad, I thought it meant like Germany number one,

04:36:00.500 --> 04:36:05.380
like China number one. What did I just say in German?

04:36:05.780 --> 04:36:08.740
Did I just say something really bad?

04:36:10.900 --> 04:36:16.100
I thought it meant China number one, but German number one. What did I just say?

04:36:23.140 --> 04:36:25.940
Did I just say something really bad? It sounds like...

04:36:26.260 --> 04:36:34.580
No, it's fine, but it can be associated with other stuff. I am so sorry.

04:36:36.580 --> 04:36:38.660
Bitter. I am so sorry.

04:36:42.500 --> 04:36:50.500
I thought it meant China number one. Let's just forget about it. I am so sorry. I genuinely

04:36:50.500 --> 04:36:53.860
thought it meant China number one, but Germany number one.

04:36:56.900 --> 04:37:02.580
When you learned your German from college, it's unironically like... Oh my God,

04:37:03.620 --> 04:37:07.620
absolute idiot. I'm so sorry. I do apologize for that.

04:37:09.940 --> 04:37:14.820
It's the first line of a national anthem. Oh wait, it's the first line of the national...

04:37:14.820 --> 04:37:15.940
German national anthem?

04:37:19.380 --> 04:37:23.460
It's only problematic if you use in a specific context. Oh, okay.

04:37:25.060 --> 04:37:30.260
Shawnee, tomorrow will start to pop out strange fan art of you in a strange and nostalgic outfit.

04:37:37.860 --> 04:37:42.340
Just remember, I don't own rights to previous things. That's what you're gonna...

04:37:42.820 --> 04:37:47.220
I might not be able to interact with it if you're maybe getting a bit too cheeky.

04:37:48.180 --> 04:37:53.620
Yeah, their national anthem from 1930s. Wait, no. I'm sorry. I really didn't...

04:37:54.260 --> 04:37:57.540
Which Germany... Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:38:00.660 --> 04:38:04.660
Genuinely thought it meant China number one. I don't know if you guys ever played

04:38:05.300 --> 04:38:13.620
PubG or something, Pub Newgrounds or whatever. But everyone used to come in and go China number one,

04:38:13.620 --> 04:38:19.060
and that was basically what I thought I just said, but I did not say that at all.

04:38:22.020 --> 04:38:25.460
Don't worry, I'm new here. How do I find where you are on the map?

04:38:26.740 --> 04:38:31.540
So when you open up map, you will start here right outside of Lumbridge,

04:38:32.500 --> 04:38:39.140
or maybe you started at the quest guy. He's literally right here. You want to go south,

04:38:39.140 --> 04:38:43.300
you can always use this cross here and click it, and it will make everything north,

04:38:43.300 --> 04:38:49.060
like north point north, and then just come south through a graveyard, and we are literally all here.

04:38:50.420 --> 04:38:55.620
So south through a graveyard and south again. Brian!

04:38:55.620 --> 04:38:58.900
My heart just dropped in my pants as you just said that.

04:38:58.900 --> 04:39:03.460
I'm so sorry. I didn't... I genuinely didn't know what it meant. I do apologize.

04:39:04.660 --> 04:39:07.860
I thought like... I thought everyone was like,

04:39:07.860 --> 04:39:12.420
yay, because I said Germany number one, and there's a few German watchers,

04:39:12.420 --> 04:39:17.700
and no, I'm just an idiot, so yep, there's that. Apologies. Sorry.

04:39:18.420 --> 04:39:21.380
Thank you for the tip. I do apologize.

04:39:23.860 --> 04:39:29.140
Ah, cringing at myself. I'm like, oh, maybe I should cut that segment out of the void,

04:39:29.140 --> 04:39:34.580
honestly. I don't want anything happening, like anything weird happening. Don't stress about it.

04:39:35.780 --> 04:39:36.980
Okay, I'll try to get there.

04:39:41.700 --> 04:39:46.340
I can't stop laughing. No, I don't laugh at me. Literally, anyone got a fire? Any fire?

04:39:47.860 --> 04:39:51.300
Yeah, probably take that out. I want to ask, how are you already so good at this?

04:39:51.300 --> 04:39:56.500
I watched someone else try, and they only have two quests left in F2P, but still need attack.

04:39:56.500 --> 04:40:01.540
Oh, I'm not good at the game. What? You were literally in it with us. I'm rubbish at the game.

04:40:02.660 --> 04:40:08.820
Literally, we have one, two, three, four, and five. We have five quests done.

04:40:08.820 --> 04:40:14.020
Oh wait, are you memeing? I watched someone try, and they only have two quests left into it,

04:40:14.020 --> 04:40:17.860
but still need a taxi to Virok. Oh right, because I actually played the game.

04:40:18.500 --> 04:40:27.940
What's the timestamp? Hold on, four hours and like 38 minutes. Hold on, I need to make more of that.

04:40:29.540 --> 04:40:31.460
Four hours, 48 minutes.

04:40:32.420 --> 04:40:46.580
Oh, be oh my. Right, there we go, wrote a note. Then it gets chopped up.

04:40:48.420 --> 04:40:52.900
We have another 90 levels of cooking in front of us. Don't let your...

04:40:54.260 --> 04:40:58.340
your not... Sorry, the love heart's in the freaking way, in the way you do.

04:40:58.340 --> 04:41:00.020
You're not Dutch knowledge to stop you.

04:41:01.700 --> 04:41:09.860
Hello, ik ben een Nederlander, ik heb honger, ja. Ik wissen in das pond.

04:41:11.620 --> 04:41:17.460
Only 13 million xp to go. No, no, no, cuddles, we're laughing with you. I was laughing at you.

04:41:17.460 --> 04:41:24.660
Okay, okay. Relaxing stream. Okay, I'm glad you find it chill like that.

04:41:28.340 --> 04:41:34.260
Sorry, I'm at the stage where I'm now cringing at myself, thinking I thought that meant Germany

04:41:34.260 --> 04:41:44.020
number one in all the contexts that I'd ever seen that phrase. Anyway, I'm going to drink my tea,

04:41:44.020 --> 04:41:46.980
and I'm probably going to cringe myself to sleep tonight.

04:41:49.780 --> 04:41:54.260
Have you declared war to something with that sentence or opened a bakery for people?

04:41:54.740 --> 04:42:01.380
Hopefully the bakery. You're fine. Oh no, is there fire maker going offline? I will make

04:42:01.380 --> 04:42:07.380
us a fire, don't you worry. Come, let me go get a tree. I think there's a tree in the swamp

04:42:07.380 --> 04:42:14.100
or something. Is there not a dead tree in here? Am I going crazy?

04:42:16.420 --> 04:42:20.180
I could have sworn there's like a dead tree in the swamp that you can... Oh, there is.

04:42:21.140 --> 04:42:25.860
I'm going to get jumped by a frog, but I'm going to be so quick. The frog ain't got time to attack

04:42:25.860 --> 04:42:33.940
me. Oh, I'm full. All right, drop, take the tree, and then run all the way back to the reefing.

04:42:34.820 --> 04:42:40.180
Oh, you made fire. Sorry. Oh my god, my wood cutting is so bad. It's going to take forever

04:42:40.180 --> 04:42:46.020
to cut this tree. Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it. I have 50, not to brag or anything,

04:42:46.100 --> 04:42:48.420
but I've got 50 XP and wood con.

04:42:54.100 --> 04:42:56.900
Let's see. Okay, okay, we're back, we're back, we're back.

04:43:08.420 --> 04:43:14.900
Just so you know, Germany number one means Deutschland of dying irons. Maybe next time.

04:43:15.460 --> 04:43:21.540
Yeah, Deutschland, Deutschland of die irons.

04:43:25.060 --> 04:43:31.380
We're learning who said streams and educate your man, huh? Get that on fire.

04:43:35.780 --> 04:43:43.700
A whole 50, literally. Not to brag. What if you moved on to higher tier fish?

04:43:43.700 --> 04:43:47.780
So we're currently trying to get fishing level 20, and then we're going to do some

04:43:47.780 --> 04:43:54.740
questing just to get overall XP. And then we're going to move on to higher level fish,

04:43:54.740 --> 04:43:57.860
just to kind of break up with a bit of fun questing in between.

04:44:00.900 --> 04:44:04.980
I hope I don't pass out too early to the confidence of this company and me so hard.

04:44:06.740 --> 04:44:10.500
Learning that Scottish Cut official of Germany, yes, this is educational content you should be

04:44:10.500 --> 04:44:11.300
seeing on for.

04:44:27.940 --> 04:44:29.380
By the Pope, I don't know for yourself.

04:44:33.380 --> 04:44:34.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:44:35.860 --> 04:44:38.500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:44:40.740 --> 04:44:50.420
Thank you for the tip, iron reefer, hardy har har. No, no, bad Brian. Don't read that out loud,

04:44:50.420 --> 04:44:59.620
Brian. That's naughty. It's naughty. There'll be no world wars. If anything, I'm actually a field

04:44:59.620 --> 04:45:07.700
medic. So I'm here to stitch you up and give you all negative blood when you're perishing from blood

04:45:07.780 --> 04:45:16.660
loss. That's literally bad boy, Brian, bad boy. Don't say that out loud. Oh my gosh.

04:45:20.340 --> 04:45:26.260
No AI, the AI uprising. What's going on here? Oh, I'm itching my little schnozer. I'm going to

04:45:26.260 --> 04:45:28.020
take a sip of my tea and see if it's...

04:45:32.420 --> 04:45:36.740
Oh my god, it's the perfect sipping temperature, truly a British moment when you

04:45:36.820 --> 04:45:39.220
enjoy when you appreciate the temperature of the tea.

04:45:42.900 --> 04:45:46.980
Who are we on for fishing? Oh wait, I'm on 18 fishing. What are you guys on for fishing? We

04:45:46.980 --> 04:45:51.460
must be getting close. We can do the quest very shortly. I'm going to put all of this in my bank

04:45:51.460 --> 04:45:59.140
though. I am not questing with all of this money on me. Sorry, don't kill some of the money. I'm zero

04:45:59.140 --> 04:46:11.460
negative life. The perfect cup of the perfect time, perfect dunking. Oh, what are they called?

04:46:11.460 --> 04:46:16.420
Apparently custard cream's got named the best dunkable biscuit. Oh, you're lit. How are you

04:46:16.420 --> 04:46:22.020
guys higher level than me, honestly? You're all cheesy, don't you?

04:46:28.340 --> 04:46:29.780
Did the Scott have a British moment?

04:46:32.260 --> 04:46:35.700
Unfortunately, I do seem to share some traits.

04:46:37.540 --> 04:46:42.020
Can I even light logs or is it going to take forever? Because I'm such a low level in fire

04:46:42.340 --> 04:46:48.580
making three, four. Oh, it took me four times. Honestly, that wasn't that bad.

04:46:50.180 --> 04:46:57.700
15, but I had to step away a few times. Oh, you had to step away because my soundbore jokes were

04:46:57.700 --> 04:47:05.700
just too good. Remember the one time when Facebook released an AI on the internet and

04:47:05.700 --> 04:47:09.140
learned from the community that turned into the biggest thing going wrong?

04:47:16.100 --> 04:47:19.380
Oh, it's four men in uniform to carry my little soldier home.

04:47:20.340 --> 04:47:27.940
What should he do? Should have been a musician, but he didn't have the money for a guitar.

04:47:28.980 --> 04:47:35.060
What should he do? Should have been a politician, but he didn't have a proper education.

04:47:35.060 --> 04:47:42.340
This is not the song that I... Did we do it? We're almost there. We flings. We're so close to 20.

04:47:43.860 --> 04:47:48.260
We're so close. By the way, do you have a plan for stages of cooking levels or would we do it

04:47:48.260 --> 04:47:56.660
Chill and Spontane 99? I absolutely have no plan whatsoever. I've returned with logs for my fire duty.

04:47:58.500 --> 04:48:04.500
I honestly have no plan whatsoever. We're going to move on to Salmon and Trout at

04:48:04.500 --> 04:48:10.660
Barbarian Village after we do some questing. And then after that, I think it's just jugs of wine.

04:48:10.660 --> 04:48:14.580
And we're literally going to be hanging out like maybe at the Grand Exchange on like a very quiet

04:48:14.660 --> 04:48:24.180
server. Oh, level 19 fishing. There might be a quest we're going to...

04:48:26.500 --> 04:48:32.500
Sorry for letting my inner German out, my quest. By the way, do you... Oh no. The fact that she didn't

04:48:32.500 --> 04:48:36.100
correct the message does mean that she already chose to go straight to level 99.

04:48:36.820 --> 04:48:40.580
Yeah, that's the plan anyway. We're going to do some questing just to break it up.

04:48:40.660 --> 04:48:50.340
And then we are going to jump back into it. I want to see if maybe we could do level 40 today.

04:48:50.340 --> 04:48:54.900
I don't think I'm going to do a full endurance stream as much as I love to harass you guys

04:48:55.860 --> 04:49:00.980
and destroy your sleep pattern. I don't think we're going to do a full 12 hour stream today.

04:49:02.260 --> 04:49:08.740
Also, my freaking VOD broke. Apparently the VODs break on 11 hours and 55 minutes,

04:49:08.740 --> 04:49:14.740
not on the 12th hour. So the end of my VOD got chopped away and it just cuts off.

04:49:16.500 --> 04:49:26.740
15 trout, 20 is... and 25 is salmon. Oh, we can make apple pies? Oh, I have a muffin!

04:49:28.340 --> 04:49:30.660
I have an apple muffin. I forgot to eat it yesterday.

04:49:31.060 --> 04:49:39.460
Yeah, something's like not really... YouTube VODs are on my list, especially the longer ones.

04:49:39.460 --> 04:49:45.620
Yeah. Oh, is it displaying again correctly? Maybe it changed. Yeah, they told us.

04:49:46.740 --> 04:49:49.780
That is a sad and frightening, so speaking super fast.

04:49:53.380 --> 04:49:57.060
M&M's got nothing on me when I'm saying bioreflums. Okay, I'm like...

04:50:01.060 --> 04:50:06.260
That explains why all the other VGVs stopped 10 minutes before the 12 hour mark.

04:50:06.260 --> 04:50:11.460
Yeah, so unfortunately, we are having to bend the knee to the VOD overlords.

04:50:11.460 --> 04:50:15.860
I wonder... I suppose they had to give a number, like it doesn't matter.

04:50:18.500 --> 04:50:26.020
Circum... wait, I thought it said circumstance. Sure, you're not a mumble rat. Oh, I'm a mumble

04:50:26.020 --> 04:50:34.660
rat. I can assure you that much. I'm annunciating my words right now. I'm annunciating. Any annunciators?

04:50:40.580 --> 04:50:41.860
Oh, come on, catch that last one.

04:50:44.340 --> 04:50:53.220
Anything to do with this inventory full of shrimp? Drop them! If you go, you cook them on the fire

04:50:53.220 --> 04:50:58.740
and then you drop them once they're all cooked. It sounds like a decision made for some technical

04:50:58.740 --> 04:51:04.500
reason over... Yeah, I assumed they had to put a number on it, but they couldn't just infinitely do it.

04:51:06.820 --> 04:51:11.460
Although there's those accounts that used to infinitely stream music. Was it Lo-Fi Girl

04:51:11.460 --> 04:51:19.620
or something like that? They just constantly keep going. I'll chug them all. If you go into

04:51:19.620 --> 04:51:25.220
sentence, you can hit... I think it's like controls or something, and it's like use shift to drop,

04:51:25.220 --> 04:51:28.420
and then if you hold shift, you can drop your full inventory stack really quickly.

04:51:35.860 --> 04:51:43.140
Okay, level 25 cooking. I'll take it, like we're getting there. It's... if I could stop burning

04:51:43.140 --> 04:51:50.500
this stuff, if we stop burning, we'd be like literally flying through the levels. Right, 20 is

04:51:50.500 --> 04:51:57.220
maybe one more deck of fish away? Lo-Fi Girl never saved Vods and didn't let you rewind,

04:51:57.860 --> 04:52:04.500
that could be why... We are learning. Okay, more of my tea. I keep forgetting.

04:52:08.660 --> 04:52:10.420
And these fishes are hiding from me.

04:52:13.540 --> 04:52:20.100
So I assume it costs money to get some of these Asterix costumes, because

04:52:20.900 --> 04:52:27.140
these are like full of costumes. I have to go in 10 minutes. I can't stay on Firejoy forever. Yes,

04:52:27.140 --> 04:52:33.060
that's okay. Don't worry, we can take over. We're probably doing by Quest next. But thank you for

04:52:33.060 --> 04:52:40.420
your service. Wait, hold on. 07. Thank you for your service on Firejoy. 07. We salute.

04:52:40.740 --> 04:52:48.180
Yeah, Wi-Fi... Lo-Fi Girl is more like a follower radio channel. Yeah.

04:52:51.460 --> 04:52:54.340
The only MTX in Old School RuneScape is Bond.

04:53:00.020 --> 04:53:05.060
You can stream them, stop, but when you end the Vod, it will only save the foot 11.55.

04:53:05.060 --> 04:53:14.180
Hmm. Well, I'll need to know that for the Donathons, because Azuras is first.

04:53:16.340 --> 04:53:20.820
20! I'm finally fishing level 20. That took so long.

04:53:24.580 --> 04:53:31.940
I can drop them. Okay, we're level 20. We're gonna do questing once I finish this batch that I've got.

04:53:32.900 --> 04:53:37.140
And then we'll go to the bank and drop off all our items and see what this Quest

04:53:37.140 --> 04:53:40.420
mini thing is all about. I don't know if I need any items for it, is it this?

04:53:41.780 --> 04:53:44.500
It began with an M, so let's scroll down to M.

04:53:48.100 --> 04:53:49.460
Let's scroll up to M's.

04:53:53.700 --> 04:54:00.420
Mystery. What do we need for that? We need... Oh, we get a reward. What do we need for it?

04:54:00.420 --> 04:54:08.580
Recommended items, none. Enemies to defeat, none. Okay. Right. We'll definitely do this.

04:54:09.220 --> 04:54:14.660
Nicely. Oh, she is right there. Okay, that makes perfect sense by that reefling. Suggested that

04:54:15.780 --> 04:54:22.500
silly of me. If we're going to do some quests, we're going to the city, then we're going to the

04:54:22.500 --> 04:54:28.500
city, then the door closes as well. Close pack. We're gonna put our items away first before we

04:54:28.500 --> 04:54:32.100
continue with the questing. I actually have to go to... Don't worry if you have to go,

04:54:32.100 --> 04:54:37.220
thank you so much reeflings for hanging. I appreciate it. I am going to try and get level

04:54:37.220 --> 04:54:43.540
99 in one month for cooking, so there will be plentiful opportunities to come hang.

04:54:44.340 --> 04:54:49.060
I'm also going to do it during the week instead of on the weekend as well to give

04:54:50.420 --> 04:54:56.340
the people who work on the weekends a chance as well to come in and join in the fun.

04:54:58.500 --> 04:55:04.660
Okay, everyone who is fishing, if you want to cook the fish, we're going to take it to the bank,

04:55:04.660 --> 04:55:09.140
if you want to cook it the new, and then we're going to make our way to the castle, and then

04:55:09.140 --> 04:55:18.580
we're going to come back and... Oh, my fire. My fire perished. So get cooking, good looking.

04:55:19.940 --> 04:55:27.300
Oh wait, that's the song. Hey, good looking. What you got cooking? It's shrimp on a fire.

04:55:27.300 --> 04:55:34.660
Shrimp on the Barbie. Oh, we're so Aussie out here. Can you go back to the mystery

04:55:34.660 --> 04:55:40.420
area after you finish? Oh wait, should we just do the quest?

04:55:43.140 --> 04:55:46.900
Reeflings have done the quest. Should we just do the quest now instead of going all the way back

04:55:46.900 --> 04:55:58.820
in like here again? I finished my tea. Do they actually eat a lot of shrimp on Aussie land?

04:55:58.820 --> 04:56:02.340
I don't know. Just do the quest. Okay, we'll do the quest.

04:56:06.340 --> 04:56:09.860
I'll wait for everyone to finish up and do their thing, and then we'll start.

04:56:10.820 --> 04:56:16.820
So let you guys cook. Those who are fishing, you can un-fish and cook, and then we'll start

04:56:16.820 --> 04:56:23.380
with this quest, and we'll pick another one. We'll do three quests, I think. I either need to do

04:56:23.380 --> 04:56:31.700
stream split recording. Yeah, for the donathons. I know you need to do back to back, so I'm actually

04:56:31.700 --> 04:56:35.940
going to have to get like a video put together for Azura to play when she goes to sleep.

04:56:35.940 --> 04:56:41.380
Hopefully her PC doesn't explode midstream. Should be a way to sleep in the thing just

04:56:42.500 --> 04:56:45.060
catch some fire in the corner of the room, and she's like, okay.

04:56:50.740 --> 04:56:57.300
We eat prawns. Are you squidding me right now? Who goes there, Brian? Do you read Patreon messages?

04:56:58.020 --> 04:57:02.340
No, so none of the talents have access to Patreon messages because it's like direct

04:57:02.420 --> 04:57:08.820
messages, so they don't have access to that stuff? No. So no, I read Marshmallows though,

04:57:08.820 --> 04:57:17.940
your mother won't come to send a marchi. I'm drinking water now after finishing my tea.

04:57:23.140 --> 04:57:29.060
Okay, is everyone almost ready? I'm gonna drop three inventory space. I'll just drop

04:57:29.060 --> 04:57:37.140
three anchovies, why not? Right, we will talk to this lady. I'll put walking on. Let's see what

04:57:37.140 --> 04:57:48.580
happens. Help, help! Start the quest. Sure, are you guys ready to come over? I'll get to 20 later.

04:57:48.580 --> 04:57:54.820
Yeah, we can always come back and do our thing. Thank you for the tip though, Anonymous.

04:57:55.780 --> 04:57:59.220
You really are shy. You could ask that for free. You didn't have to give me money to

04:57:59.220 --> 04:58:03.460
ask that question. You guys are always welcome to ask and chat. I know it can be never again,

04:58:03.460 --> 04:58:07.540
or you can ask in Marshmallow, but I might be sold to respond because I'm not reading Marshmallows

04:58:07.540 --> 04:58:13.380
right now. Thank you for the tip, but save your money at the same time, seriously.

04:58:14.260 --> 04:58:21.380
Ray, are we ready? Are you my refillings? You are. You're not quite ready, hold on. Oh, sorry.

04:58:21.380 --> 04:58:27.300
Right, I'm accepting the quest. What has happened here? We were invited to a house party on the

04:58:27.300 --> 04:58:31.060
island not far from here. Something felt wrong about the whole thing, but we went away. The

04:58:31.060 --> 04:58:34.500
house seemed pretty creepy, but everything was going fine. We were having a good time,

04:58:34.500 --> 04:58:40.660
and that's when we got attacked, and I tried to save her. Huey brought me enough time to find

04:58:40.660 --> 04:58:45.860
an old bolt. I went back to get him, but it was too late. I'm scared he won't make it. You have to

04:58:45.860 --> 04:58:52.340
do something. They can't get away with this. What do you want me to do? That cycle is still

04:58:52.340 --> 04:58:57.220
out there. You have to bring them to justice. The boat we escaped on is just over there,

04:58:57.220 --> 04:59:02.580
and you can use it to get to the island. Okay, I'll see what I can do. I need to fight, I hope not.

04:59:03.300 --> 04:59:05.140
Can reflings see this boat over here?

04:59:05.380 --> 04:59:13.540
Can you point in the way? Let's check that you're all here.

04:59:14.820 --> 04:59:20.580
He's got a refling, got a few. Okay, end of the boat, end of the boat.

04:59:22.340 --> 04:59:26.500
And joins. How bold of you, considering she has a plan. Stranny, I was wondering if you were

04:59:26.500 --> 04:59:32.100
following some kind of, uh, gay deciding to do... Nah, I'm just going for it. We're literally doing

04:59:32.100 --> 04:59:36.820
quest and right now, like I'm already getting distracted from the 99 grind.

04:59:39.460 --> 04:59:47.220
Okay, I think that's all my reflings. These are actual plots. Okay, into the boat we go. Yippee!

04:59:49.060 --> 04:59:52.420
There's a chance you ask the question and check out typically better chances, I don't know.

04:59:53.700 --> 04:59:58.500
I know, but you still do it for free. Just like keep... Like if I miss it, then ask it again in

04:59:58.500 --> 05:00:04.260
like a couple of minutes. Oh my god, there's so many of us doing this quest right now. We're

05:00:04.260 --> 05:00:12.500
going to overload this. It looks kind of familiar. Ooh, where are we? Oh, okay, we need to take a

05:00:12.500 --> 05:00:18.900
left refling. For those of you who don't have the plugin, we're going to pick up this bucket right

05:00:18.900 --> 05:00:24.260
here on the left. Oh no, is it instance bucket? Why are we taking the bucket? Pick up from the bucket.

05:00:24.980 --> 05:00:30.820
Is it an instance bucket? Oh no, we can all take it. Okay, that's good. Okay, drop.

05:00:33.700 --> 05:00:41.540
Okay, everyone get a bucket. Pick up your bucket. Sits right by the fountain. Oh my god,

05:00:41.540 --> 05:00:51.860
the beacons are lit. Gondor calls rage. Okay, and then we have the barrel of rainwater.

05:00:51.860 --> 05:00:57.140
Interact with it. We need to search it. Okay, there's like lots of noises going on.

05:00:59.700 --> 05:01:09.540
Whoa, party on, bro. Oh, it's like that movie that I've not seen. Whoa, the wind totally just felt like

05:01:10.100 --> 05:01:21.460
some breathing on my neck. Oh, not cool, bro. I feel woozy, gurg. I see the light.

05:01:23.300 --> 05:01:29.220
It's not my tame, glurg, glurgle, gargle. Oh, that's a bit. I don't know what movie he's from. I've

05:01:29.220 --> 05:01:36.420
not seen it, but I've seen it. You know what I mean? I've not seen the movie. Help me.

05:01:39.700 --> 05:01:44.500
Man, you're taking a while to perish. Sid collapses on the ground in a crumpled mess.

05:01:44.500 --> 05:01:49.460
As he falls down, you spot something shiny fall out of his shirt pocket and into the barrel of

05:01:49.460 --> 05:01:57.780
water. Gosh, that was horrible and so drawn out. Oh, wow, he's still going.

05:02:01.300 --> 05:02:05.460
I think he's actually gone this time. Who are you? Why are you doing this?

05:02:06.180 --> 05:02:13.220
Hmm, he didn't say anything. Scary movie. Oh, it's Scream. Oh, I've got to find a way

05:02:13.220 --> 05:02:19.380
into that house and stop this maniac. I wonder what it is that I saw fall into that barrel.

05:02:20.660 --> 05:02:26.260
Search the barrel, reflings. The barrel's full of rainwater. I can't see what's in there. Oh, right,

05:02:26.260 --> 05:02:31.300
click on the barrel in your inventory and use it on the barrel of rainwater. You fill the bucket

05:02:31.300 --> 05:02:37.220
from the barrel. Okay, now what? Now we search the barrel. You find a key at the bottom of the barrel.

05:02:39.140 --> 05:02:46.020
Uh, are you seeing strong? Okay, now we go to the front of the house.

05:02:50.340 --> 05:02:55.780
It's so scary. Oh, it's making the noises.

05:02:56.740 --> 05:03:04.340
Chop down. No, open large door. Okay, here we go. The bunny went ahead. I saw that bunny.

05:03:04.340 --> 05:03:11.700
He closed the door behind you. Let us in the house. Right, there we go. Oh, the door all closes. Hold

05:03:11.700 --> 05:03:17.940
on. I think the door all closed. Oh, does it all close? Wait, I can't even get in. Is this open

05:03:17.940 --> 05:03:24.420
large door? No. I think we're all trying to get in at once. Right, I'm not clicking it. I'm just

05:03:25.220 --> 05:03:33.060
okay. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, all right, I'm getting there. We're getting there. We're

05:03:33.060 --> 05:03:38.340
getting there. We're getting there. Hold on. Hold on. Why am I not going inside? It's not

05:03:38.340 --> 05:03:43.460
because someone's doing the door thing. It's one at a time. Right, okay, that's fine.

05:03:45.380 --> 05:03:50.260
Okay. Oh, okay, I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. Okay. Oh, that took us a hot thing there. Right,

05:03:50.260 --> 05:03:56.340
let's get the other refunds in. Everyone in. Everyone in. Okay, a few more. A few more

05:03:56.340 --> 05:04:03.220
refunds. A few more stragglers. Can you come? Can you come? One more. One more. Can you come? Can

05:04:03.220 --> 05:04:09.940
you come? Click that door? Right, we're in. We're in. Right, everyone, touch the table in the entrance

05:04:09.940 --> 05:04:18.100
way. Oh my goodness. There's a knife on the table. Touch that table. Oh, we're touching the table.

05:04:18.740 --> 05:04:26.740
Okay. Once you've touched the table, touch this door. Oh, the door. The door. Oh, cut scene.

05:04:28.180 --> 05:04:42.580
Knock, knock. Who's there? Oh, no. Gurgle. Oh, he said you're next to me.

05:04:42.740 --> 05:04:50.980
Oh, he's using cheat see doodles. What's this? A note. I guess I should read it.

05:04:51.940 --> 05:04:56.340
Let's go get the note. Oh, he left the note. Okay. It should be a note to your left.

05:04:56.340 --> 05:05:02.180
You take a copy of the note. Let's read it. Isn't murder just the work of art,

05:05:02.180 --> 05:05:07.060
beautiful yet haunting like the blade of a knife as we wander through the valley of death?

05:05:07.060 --> 05:05:11.220
Oh, spooky. Oh, okay.

05:05:15.460 --> 05:05:20.740
Is this on the other side? Oh, okay. Everyone enter this room. It doesn't really look like a room.

05:05:20.740 --> 05:05:26.740
Oh, it's a some room anyway. Oh, look at this painting. Wait, why am I getting turned this

05:05:26.740 --> 05:05:32.580
way for the painting? Hello? Hello? Okay, examine painting.

05:05:33.380 --> 05:05:40.020
Wait, what am I supposed to do? Oh, use the knife on the painting. I didn't

05:05:40.020 --> 05:05:43.140
even know I had a knife on me. Use the knife in your inventory on the painting.

05:05:44.180 --> 05:05:49.140
Beat that painting up. Show it. You mean boss. You slash open the painting revealing a hidden

05:05:49.140 --> 05:05:57.620
storage compartment. Search painting. You find a key hidden inside the slash painting.

05:05:57.620 --> 05:06:03.460
Okay. If you found your key, come back out into the entrance wave. You've got the key

05:06:03.460 --> 05:06:09.460
from the painting by cutting it up into the entrance way. Okay, just a few more.

05:06:10.820 --> 05:06:13.940
Use the knife in your inventory on the painting in that room.

05:06:14.740 --> 05:06:20.260
And then once you've got the key, come back into the hallway. We're doing it. We're questing.

05:06:21.220 --> 05:06:26.660
They have a higher pit than you. What's a pit?

05:06:30.820 --> 05:06:31.380
Are we good?

05:06:34.180 --> 05:06:41.620
There should be a knife in your inventory. And then you can highlight it by using right click

05:06:41.620 --> 05:06:50.900
and then slash the shoes of it. There you go, you key. Alrighty. And then we go through this door

05:06:50.900 --> 05:07:01.620
right here. Oh, there's a refund party in here, clearly. Oh, someone's spooking us behind the door.

05:07:03.460 --> 05:07:08.020
Okay, once you enter this new room, there's a little Orbe thing to the left. I don't know what

05:07:08.020 --> 05:07:14.420
it does, but it's highlighted. Examine the unlit candle on the wall. Oh, we're to tinderbox

05:07:17.220 --> 05:07:26.500
the thing on the wall. Tinderbox the unlit candle. Oh, wait, do you guys need a knife for a tinderbox

05:07:26.500 --> 05:07:35.940
or is it like in this room? Do you guys need me to trade this? There's a bunch in here. Okay,

05:07:35.940 --> 05:07:39.700
okay, that's good. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, literally all on the shelf. There's a tinderbox

05:07:39.700 --> 05:07:44.980
on the shelf if you need help. You light the candle. So light the two unlit candles. Oh,

05:07:44.980 --> 05:07:50.580
there's a third one as well. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Video Game. Oh, I just touched my fish.

05:07:50.580 --> 05:07:58.340
Hold on. Wait, that sounded odd. I think she's more happy of the fact that there's

05:07:58.660 --> 05:08:03.700
20 people doing the same thing. Literally, Jagex is like, what on earth?

05:08:05.460 --> 05:08:08.420
Ah, I'm sure they've had it before people go questing together.

05:08:09.460 --> 05:08:15.220
You light the candle. The room is sufficiently warm. The fuse should now have dried out. Oh,

05:08:18.820 --> 05:08:21.860
once you tinderbox all the things, do the barrel?

05:08:22.180 --> 05:08:29.060
I don't know. And get the heck out of the room. Get out of the room as soon as you light that

05:08:29.060 --> 05:08:34.100
thing. Hold on, let me run. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that room. Give me that

05:08:36.500 --> 05:08:41.380
the thing about to blow. Oh, okay, okay, okay.

05:08:44.340 --> 05:08:49.860
All right. Hey, it's the shadow one that kept closing the doors on me.

05:08:51.860 --> 05:08:56.180
that's known or not, if this is in life, why are you so excited if I touch the doors and

05:08:56.180 --> 05:09:00.660
tables? I'm just like it's so fun being like oh my god request them together and for those

05:09:00.660 --> 05:09:06.180
who don't have room light I'm like I'm the quest teller you know so once you've let everything

05:09:06.180 --> 05:09:11.300
and blew it up we can all go outside in this section so I'll wait for the reeflings to come over

05:09:11.300 --> 05:09:13.780
yeah they're like having to get out the room because it's blowing up

05:09:15.860 --> 05:09:18.340
I just find it really fun getting to play games together

05:09:19.300 --> 05:09:26.420
so we're getting the god sword right? I don't know what the god sword is

05:09:28.500 --> 05:09:33.460
we are all here merely by coincidence there's absolutely nothing in common that we all have

05:09:38.580 --> 05:09:39.620
is there anyone else can say?

05:09:40.420 --> 05:09:42.260
are you squiddling me right now?

05:09:42.820 --> 05:09:43.220

yes there's four candles in that room to light on the walls you take a tinder box from the shelf

05:10:02.180 --> 05:10:06.260
a little tinder box on the shelf and then you light all four candles in the room

05:10:06.260 --> 05:10:11.220
and then there'll be a powder keg that you can light here just on the outskirts of that room

05:10:11.860 --> 05:10:15.940
it will blow a hole in the wall but you need to yeah you light it and then leave the room

05:10:16.660 --> 05:10:17.700

05:35:25.980 --> 05:35:32.140
go first i'll let the reeflings go because they've been they're playing with me without having a

05:35:32.140 --> 05:35:40.620
both time no witnesses the reeflings will never talk fair and square the actual end boss of the game

05:35:41.180 --> 05:35:45.260
i don't think they're snowballs either but they may contain some terms in common

05:35:46.780 --> 05:35:55.260
hold on okay we need to talk to the mandy right here oh hi scottles fish hi mandy how you feeling

05:37:20.860 --> 05:37:22.700
all right let's see here

05:37:23.820 --> 05:37:35.820
uh okay i think we should go to the bank and put all our items away and then we'll pick

05:37:35.820 --> 05:37:43.580
what quest to do next what's a free quest that's easy goblin diplomacy is pretty easy

05:37:43.580 --> 05:37:49.260
erinus the chicken i think you need to have combat uh i think you need combat for erinus

05:37:49.980 --> 05:37:52.140
sleep well good night those who have to go

05:37:55.020 --> 05:38:01.100
good night shrani and until later i don't know if there's anything easy

05:38:01.100 --> 05:38:06.700
erinus the chicken is probably the easiest we've got right now i think we may need to level so

05:38:06.780 --> 05:38:12.220
that's not really why we need to level out just our runaway segment

05:38:13.260 --> 05:38:17.100
hmm all kind it's all a refund here i think

05:38:23.100 --> 05:38:26.780
yeah i've got some stuff to try not to get food but for those who have to go don't worry if you

05:38:26.780 --> 05:38:31.420
have to go understand it's not possible we'll do erinus the chicken and then we're gonna go back

05:38:31.420 --> 05:38:35.260
to fishing hey sorry we're gonna go back to leveling up cooking

05:38:38.700 --> 05:38:43.980
okay is everyone here i think everyone's here i don't know if that other reeflings still stuck

05:38:43.980 --> 05:38:50.620
on the island possibly i'm going crazy didn't mean to just see him back on the island

05:38:52.860 --> 05:38:55.420
wait there is a reefling that got stuck in that quest i think

05:38:56.300 --> 05:38:57.420
it's called scrawny sea

05:38:59.980 --> 05:39:04.540
oh no that was you i think okay see you later bye bye reeflings thank you for joining for the

05:39:04.540 --> 05:39:09.500
ones who have to leave don't worry if you have to leave in game right if you want to follow me

05:39:09.500 --> 05:39:15.340
if you could if you hover on me it should say follow uh and then we'll i'll take you to the bank

05:39:15.340 --> 05:39:20.380
and then we'll do erinus the chicken i don't know what is but we'll do it anyway oh i'll walk sorry

05:39:20.380 --> 05:39:24.460

05:39:28.220 --> 05:39:30.780

steven hawken meme that sounds really terrible but

05:39:42.940 --> 05:39:50.780
hmm that's what the meme was so when it came out that steven hawken went on the island

05:39:50.780 --> 05:39:55.180
someone like did a quote and it was like i want to go to the island why won't you let me go

05:39:58.140 --> 05:40:04.300
um oh i just live in the prime world i know the stream isn't over yet but when do you think

05:40:04.300 --> 05:40:11.420

05:40:39.260 --> 05:40:45.180
endurance stream next week is skyrim and runescape uh i don't think today we're going to do the

05:40:45.180 --> 05:40:49.980
full 12 hours because i've actually just quite a lot of 12 hours go upstairs on the top of the bank

05:40:49.980 --> 05:40:55.500
how are you everywhere am i going crazy or is this a bot or is this a reefland that like is just

05:40:55.500 --> 05:41:01.340
no like how are you leveling up outside here what we didn't even get here i'm going crazy

05:41:01.340 --> 05:41:08.460
i swear that's a reefland right empty everything inside uh i guess you can just drop the

05:41:09.020 --> 05:41:10.620
notes from that minigame

05:41:13.500 --> 05:41:19.020
uh and then erin is the chicken i'm actually going to equip my sword and shield and i like pretty

05:41:19.020 --> 05:41:23.100
sure i got unequipped for some reason and i don't want to be completely defenseless

05:41:23.980 --> 05:41:27.100
when i'm out there i think you just draw destroy you guess

05:41:31.820 --> 05:41:37.020
wait am i not allowed to destroy the notes they'll just put them in the bank then

05:41:37.980 --> 05:41:39.900

05:41:40.620 --> 05:41:46.140
no that's me all right okay okay okay okay i could just what i was like i'm sure that's

05:41:46.140 --> 05:41:51.020

05:42:31.420 --> 05:42:35.820
we're gonna do erin big big erin need the chicken buck buck uh show on the map

05:42:36.940 --> 05:42:45.260
we need to go oh outside this location here i don't know do we level up i feel like we need to

05:42:45.260 --> 05:42:54.860
do a bit of combat well we go kill cows for like i'm not even kidding we'll go uh kill cows for

05:42:54.860 --> 05:43:01.580
like five minutes so we're gonna go across the bridge and get cows reeflings come down to the castle

05:43:01.580 --> 05:43:06.860
i'll wait for you at the front of the castle make sure you have a sword and a shield equited you

05:43:06.860 --> 05:43:13.900
got it from tutorial island 100 hours are five strong streams of frogs in the lake honestly

05:43:13.900 --> 05:43:16.940
so

05:43:17.820 --> 05:43:26.140
maybe cool right we will just go outside the castle uh and i'll make sure everyone i don't see anyone

05:43:26.140 --> 05:43:31.900
coming down the stairs from there i think everyone's on you guys are quick i don't think

05:43:31.900 --> 05:43:37.740
there's anyone i don't see anyone okay we're gonna cross the bridge five streams must be

05:43:37.740 --> 05:43:48.780
short ones honestly i just five streams uh i give me one second i'm getting

05:43:49.660 --> 05:43:51.820
me

05:44:05.740 --> 05:44:12.460
right we're gonna go into the cows pen and we're literally gonna go nuts and destroy

05:44:12.460 --> 05:44:20.780
and all these cows up ahead okay just so some people get nine in cooking by at skill 33 with

05:44:20.780 --> 05:44:26.460
6000 grapes and turning them into wine is that the fastest ice pee maker i thought it was sharks

05:44:26.460 --> 05:44:32.300
but sharks are expensive me oh someone wants to trade sorry sorry i didn't see the offer

05:44:33.580 --> 05:44:40.060
what do you offer me poison are you telling me killing them oh my god what did you do poison

05:44:40.060 --> 05:44:50.700
and fish food reef land that's so mean i got given poison and freaking fish food tell me tell

05:44:50.700 --> 05:44:56.220
me you don't like me without telling me you don't like me reefland sheesh right let's absolutely

05:44:56.220 --> 05:45:04.940
destroy these cows even if you just get a few like to level up i guess even a tiny bit of a level

05:45:04.940 --> 05:45:12.700
up is better than nothing something about not being able to burn wine wine making is the fastest okay

05:45:16.860 --> 05:45:25.180
based for reefling someone said okay just get the cows just attack the cows at all willy nilly

05:45:26.780 --> 05:45:32.300
and then we can level up our combat a bit because our combat is so low that we're like

05:45:32.780 --> 05:45:38.860
really vulnerable to pretty much anything destroy that reefland mods slap them silly

05:45:40.140 --> 05:45:44.460
mods remove this man sis just call things

05:45:47.580 --> 05:45:54.380
why are you following this noob just call things okay i love that answer is there more cows over

05:45:54.380 --> 05:46:00.380
here oh there is there's like tons of cows okay and don't worry you can attack everything in this field

05:46:02.540 --> 05:46:04.780
level up oh i said enjoy

05:46:07.660 --> 05:46:13.500
we will hunt them down mods put chewed up gum in this in his best shoes

05:46:15.420 --> 05:46:17.660
mods make sure his pillow is always warm

05:46:20.300 --> 05:46:27.740
yeah see we like literally already we're getting so strong we're just beating absolutely everything up

05:46:28.060 --> 05:46:36.780
why did actually how did they know i'm a noob is that the way i dress i'm literally wearing

05:46:36.780 --> 05:46:42.860
a thousand gold drip and they called me a noob not to brag but my combat levels five right now

05:46:43.420 --> 05:46:49.500
like i'm sorry but but runescape players quake when they see me i'm sorry just quake when they

05:46:49.500 --> 05:46:55.980
see me they can't help it their timbers are shivered whenever they see scottl fish login online

05:46:56.940 --> 05:47:00.300
oh i've only got four health i should maybe be a bit more careful honestly

05:47:02.700 --> 05:47:06.060
oh i've only got three health maybe i should be really careful uh

05:47:07.580 --> 05:47:15.660
hmm i'm not sure i can maybe fight the baby cows if i get beaten up by a cow i'm gonna be

05:47:15.660 --> 05:47:22.700
really embarrassed okay oh my god a baby cow destroy it combat level five literally

05:47:22.700 --> 05:47:27.980
we quiver before you as well but for different reasons

05:47:30.620 --> 05:47:36.460
oh my god the way that we think like rolls over as well it's so sad i'll plant some bums

05:47:38.220 --> 05:47:44.940
all right i can only attack baby cows because i've only got three hp i swear if any reefling

05:47:44.940 --> 05:47:49.500
perishes against cows i'm gonna be embarrassed for result okay oh sorry someone said they wish

05:47:49.500 --> 05:47:53.260
to trade sorry sorry let me beat up this baby cow and then i'll accept the tree

05:47:58.380 --> 05:48:02.380
oh my god i'm on one hp no way this baby cow is gonna get me mods

05:48:06.220 --> 05:48:12.700
i need to get out of the field oh my god i'm one hp in a dream hold on right let's try that again

05:48:13.660 --> 05:48:18.220
okay i literally i'm the one that's gonna perish from the cow hold on let me uh

05:48:18.220 --> 05:48:23.660
accept this trade i was so sorry chin up offer

05:48:25.900 --> 05:48:33.420
oh no can you not trade that's okay if you can't do it in time uh i guess we'll just hang about here

05:48:33.420 --> 05:48:39.020
yeah we're just gonna hang about oh they're cooking meat cannot trade yeah i'm a new account it's

05:48:39.100 --> 05:48:46.300
cause like i'm not cleared enough do you have meat excuse me little reefling uh can i get some of

05:48:46.300 --> 05:48:58.060
your meat please one bit of meat so i can heal just one meat oh you not got any i saw you cooking

05:48:58.060 --> 05:49:07.660
though i do not have any oh wait i can make some if i pick up some off the ground wait a minute

05:49:07.660 --> 05:49:14.220
hold on a minute i can do it man i'm an independent strummer use the meat on the fire and then eat the

05:49:14.220 --> 05:49:21.900
meat it's genius i did it okay we can go back to sleep and let's go we'll get a few more combat

05:49:21.900 --> 05:49:27.820
levels like this chickens can only hit zero so that's good for you accounts now we need a challenge

05:49:27.900 --> 05:49:28.460
for the coup

05:49:34.460 --> 05:49:37.900
uh we're now attack level four oh my god we're getting so strong

05:49:38.780 --> 05:49:44.860
they can't handle us when we enter the lobby i'm gonna actually cook again because i want to heal up

05:49:47.660 --> 05:49:54.380
i'm gaming so hard right now oh no i burnt it oh i thought we were like high enough level

05:49:54.380 --> 05:50:04.540
not to burn level on me honestly uh i don't know what combat level we are we're combat level five

05:50:04.540 --> 05:50:11.980
surely that's enough for questing surely kopium let me know wild strongy can survive in nature

05:50:11.980 --> 05:50:19.820
like it's rough out in in nature it's rough i just need to heal and then i can start walloping

05:50:19.820 --> 05:50:26.700
everything again there boom uh let me keep them pack or is it better to like swap between like the

05:50:26.700 --> 05:50:39.580
same thing so cows can burn it's genius why do the farmers randomly let you perish their cars

05:50:39.580 --> 05:50:48.220
honestly i'm not even sure wait i think it might be faster to do like strength and then i might get

05:50:48.300 --> 05:50:52.700
like a combat level faster i'm not sure if that's right though i could be completely wrong

05:50:53.420 --> 05:50:58.540
about that wait there's like more cows over here we can just annihilate yeah there's like tons over

05:50:58.540 --> 05:51:10.700
here best to train strength or maybe defense because like i've not got much hp points like

05:51:10.700 --> 05:51:15.900
owl oh sorry someone wishes to trade with me drop some meat over here if you want a strongy

05:51:15.900 --> 05:51:23.180
since i can't trade the reeflings feeding me oh they're feeding me thank you reeflings

05:51:24.780 --> 05:51:31.820
that's a lot of meat jeez you're a packing is that six whole meat for me it is thank you

05:51:32.460 --> 05:51:38.300
i'm a bite into it oh wait i'm already full health wait i only have nine hp or no i have

05:51:38.300 --> 05:51:46.300
10 hp that's like tiny azura remainder azura duly is going live i i'm unsure what game she's doing

05:51:48.860 --> 05:51:53.740
oh my god check out the outfit check out the drip let's say dripped out in the colors

05:52:01.100 --> 05:52:07.900
we're getting there we're getting there surely and no freaking head bang oh my god you know

05:52:07.900 --> 05:52:12.620
what that reminds me of i think the reason why i laugh so much at that is because of this

05:52:13.500 --> 05:52:18.700
right hear me out hear me out where is it let me find it

05:52:21.260 --> 05:52:24.940
i think that's why that makes me laugh so much because it looks so ridiculous

05:52:25.820 --> 05:52:29.260
that's the only reason i think i like the head banging a moat the most

05:52:29.500 --> 05:52:33.980
this is absolutely ridiculous

05:52:40.460 --> 05:52:47.740
wow i don't know it's level six combat enough to like not get attacked all the time i look sucky

05:52:48.540 --> 05:52:52.940
sorry i look sussy sorry i didn't mean i said that wrong i didn't mean to say it like that

05:52:53.660 --> 05:52:59.820
oh i'm level two strength check me out oh sorry someone wants to trade with me

05:52:59.820 --> 05:53:05.900
i'm sorry i missed it i'm sorry i'm too i'm too fatigued too fatigued i'm too enthralled

05:53:05.900 --> 05:53:12.620
with perishing these cows to get some level ups very be sucky i'm sorry look i've got things on my

05:53:12.780 --> 05:53:17.740
mind you know the marshmallows i've been getting recently oh yeah

05:53:22.940 --> 05:53:32.220
okay accept trade what show me what you got oh it's a strength potion and cooked salmon

05:53:33.740 --> 05:53:38.460
okay i don't know how long i only wanted to be here for like a wee bit and then we'll

05:53:38.700 --> 05:53:44.220
straight back in to leveling up cooking because i'm like accidentally save questing a little too

05:53:44.220 --> 05:53:49.580
much what i wanted to do was get some level so when we do airness to chicken we don't all perish

05:53:49.580 --> 05:53:54.140
i think we can run a wave for whatever is going on oh yeah you know all right

05:53:56.700 --> 05:54:01.340
um i just didn't want us to perish really quickly when we did airness to chicken

05:54:02.140 --> 05:54:10.460
i don't know what is there is live with um thank you very much we fling for all the food supplies

05:54:10.460 --> 05:54:20.860
as well um oh what almost like up my strength level up level up combat level six unstoppable

05:54:20.860 --> 05:54:29.020
truly unstoppable they cannot they cannot strength potion for stronger uh okay i took a sip i took a

05:54:29.020 --> 05:54:35.980
sip everything's gonna i don't know how long it lasts wait where's the effect i don't know how long

05:54:35.980 --> 05:54:44.700
these things the pots last i've kept up this much of a fight i fear what bills are capable

05:54:44.700 --> 05:54:52.780
she can now destroy baby cows with ease i truly am evil truly i don't know how long it was

05:54:53.180 --> 05:55:00.860
yeah strength potion yeah top left the fist so strength boost

05:55:03.820 --> 05:55:11.020
60 seconds no it does not last six seconds that's so small when you heal

05:55:11.740 --> 05:55:16.300
oh salmon heals a lot actually we need to start like a salmon ring

05:55:17.660 --> 05:55:22.140
is it normal to heal multiple multiple strong voices simultaneously in my head i hope not

05:55:22.140 --> 05:55:30.700
if i left the echo on one boosted start point drains every 30 seconds that's so quick

05:55:33.260 --> 05:55:42.540
oh i'm no strength level four i'm rolling these coos there's no echo okay it's just a reef flings

05:55:42.540 --> 05:55:48.860
finally losing the plot oh i now can have a live in hp okay maybe we should have done a bit of

05:55:48.860 --> 05:55:54.380
training a wee bit earlier but look we're leveling up that's the main thing we're getting there

05:55:55.420 --> 05:55:59.820
i don't know if we should maybe go for like five

05:56:03.100 --> 05:56:08.220
hmm echo isn't on i think he's just becoming extra strongy pill so it depends on how strongly

05:56:08.220 --> 05:56:15.020
your potion is supposed to do as there is playing one shot like how strong he sends excited every

05:56:15.020 --> 05:56:20.780
time she unlocks levels it's so satisfying it's like oh you've unlocked a new level but yeah i have

05:56:21.820 --> 05:56:26.060
i'm such a big girl i'm so smart it's in my tea

05:56:29.660 --> 05:56:30.620
hydration check

05:56:35.500 --> 05:56:39.420
i think the echo effect if i was playing a video game doesn't sound that good like

05:56:39.980 --> 05:56:43.980
this is for example what would sound like like oh i'm just killing this food right now

05:56:43.980 --> 05:56:48.700
and it just sounds mental it sounds like you've lost the plot fine uh you've actually lost the plot

05:56:50.140 --> 05:56:54.540
it's not it's not sounding good you know there that should be it back to me

05:56:55.900 --> 05:57:01.740
i think i got an unsubtremisors channel it's very plausible everyone's youtube links should be in

05:57:02.700 --> 05:57:10.860
my description right we'll do five defense we're almost level seven combat let's go

05:57:10.860 --> 05:57:14.380
oh my god serenity

05:57:16.780 --> 05:57:20.780
how are you doing how is your stream even though you're probably exhausted and the last thing you

05:57:20.780 --> 05:57:26.060
want to do is get a ton of heck in comments and be like i'm on the way to shame oh no no no

05:57:26.060 --> 05:57:33.580
and because it's a holiday hopefully it was good though and you had fun hi raiders i'm strongy

05:57:33.580 --> 05:57:39.260
cuttles from vealer and i'm currently doing my stream snake game of the day of the week sorry

05:57:39.260 --> 05:57:44.700
um and we're playing old-school rinscape we're in three world 3a which is free to play and we're

05:57:44.700 --> 05:57:50.860
just leveling up our accounts a little bit because we are super weak and we're i'm scared to send us

05:57:50.860 --> 05:57:58.940
questing because someone might fall down uh what level is your attack my attack is four strength is

05:57:58.940 --> 05:58:04.860
five and defense is one i'm currently doing defense right now uh just to try and get overall

05:58:04.860 --> 05:58:13.420
combat level sweetie bun raid i never saw old-school rinscape before oh it's basically

05:58:13.420 --> 05:58:18.460
an incremental game and you just click and like literally this is the graphics i'm not even kidding

05:58:18.460 --> 05:58:24.140
like check me out i've got a gold plated chef's hat on gold apron on like this is the graphics

05:58:24.140 --> 05:58:30.940
tell me this is not like you you've not seen anything better just a minute it's a sweetie

05:58:30.940 --> 05:58:40.220
bun raid bun bun raid help i fall and i'm literally dropped out like why did i get a message and be

05:58:40.220 --> 05:58:48.940
logged in 30 minutes but yeah we're just leveling up um because we want to do some questing but

05:58:48.940 --> 05:58:54.860
can't eat weird i always saw the youtube makeup that's not the default graphics that's using the

05:58:54.860 --> 05:59:02.700
i don't oh at least even worse than this oh it's been six hours already i didn't realize either

05:59:02.700 --> 05:59:09.260
hi hi sorry for stealing all your time guys time flies when you're having fun time flies

05:59:10.220 --> 05:59:16.700
this is peak graphics you you do not get better than this the year is 2024 you you can't be look

05:59:16.700 --> 05:59:23.500
let's admire the daisies right here let's zoom in a little look at the daisies man look at that

05:59:23.500 --> 05:59:29.660
beautiful you can see every poly what's that a poly thing like every triangle

05:59:31.740 --> 05:59:34.140
oh all the triangles are made out

05:59:39.100 --> 05:59:44.460
oh i've reached a total level of 100 ooh our accounts are getting better

05:59:45.100 --> 05:59:53.260
yeah we've started on fresh accounts so all that go censored it did hold on let me eat a salmon

05:59:55.100 --> 06:00:02.220
well we're at combat level seven oh we are getting potent okay anyone look polygon that's what i mean

06:00:02.220 --> 06:00:09.900
yeah polygon but if anyone looks as funny i'm gonna get them level seven go and get them

06:00:10.620 --> 06:00:17.660
they can't handle they can't handle it lara croft polygon chest honestly

06:00:20.140 --> 06:00:24.460
okay think we're getting there we're getting there maybe we do five on each

06:00:25.900 --> 06:00:31.260
eight combat means we can survive a little bit of a hit a little bit of a punch if you will

06:00:32.220 --> 06:00:35.100
triangle oh that should be

06:00:42.620 --> 06:00:46.060
and then wherever erin is chicken starts i'm actually unsure

06:00:49.340 --> 06:00:56.220
wow level four did i put my combat we're at seven point six for combat i like how it shows you the

06:00:56.220 --> 06:01:00.700
increment as well like to be like you're getting closer i'm pretty sure prayer counts to your

06:01:00.700 --> 06:01:10.460
overall combat level as well so i fonder the triangles um so i don't know if we should do some

06:01:10.460 --> 06:01:16.380
i've never done is it the altar it's like dragon bone altar run but they're so expensive

06:01:16.940 --> 06:01:19.820
and i would need personal guards like all the way over

06:01:23.420 --> 06:01:28.140
see that's the fastest way to level up prayer i believe but yeah

06:01:28.140 --> 06:01:34.780
yeah watching stroney and emean spritz playing a game on my own almost feels like a friend

06:01:34.780 --> 06:01:41.580
isn't there no sensory overload doing that i feel like i'd be like i couldn't handle it

06:01:41.580 --> 06:01:45.580
i feel like there's too much going on it's emean join her game so far

06:01:45.580 --> 06:01:58.060
i already need a p again i feel like whenever i have a t she's loving it oh i'm glad

06:01:59.100 --> 06:02:06.300
that's what i like to hear see on your picture oh i'm level four health sorry four hp

06:02:07.260 --> 06:02:15.180
where i think there's everyone at least like level we've got level six reflin yeah that's good

06:02:17.100 --> 06:02:22.860
okay apparently if we get level five in attack we're getting leveled i've got level 10 reflin

06:02:22.860 --> 06:02:29.500
over there we can't tell we've got level six as well yeah we're getting a bit better getting a bit

06:02:29.500 --> 06:02:35.740
better we're definitely not to be trifled with even though we're not level 10 combat yet but we're

06:02:35.740 --> 06:02:41.180
not to be messed with how do you pee so much yes although i honestly do not know i know that caffeine

06:02:41.180 --> 06:02:45.580
makes you want to wee wee all the time so i think that might be because i'm having so much tease from

06:02:45.580 --> 06:02:51.500
my throat yay we're like doing little mini tasks as well

06:02:57.340 --> 06:03:01.980

06:06:01.820 --> 06:06:16.220
chicken uh erin is starting off four quest points oh that's the rewards able to survive a skeleton

06:06:16.220 --> 06:06:25.660

Why is that so loud on the music

Thank goodness it doesn't leak the details on the air. I'm glad too

06:19:01.580 --> 06:19:03.580
I think runescape know that some people

06:19:04.060 --> 06:19:06.060
Stream it what we're doing evil. All right

06:19:06.940 --> 06:19:09.420
Uh, what we're doing air nest

06:19:10.300 --> 06:19:12.300

06:19:12.300 --> 06:19:16.860
When refling went to go grab some speeds for people don't have one. Oh sugar. I don't have a speed either

06:19:18.060 --> 06:19:20.060
Oh, wait

06:19:24.700 --> 06:19:28.140
Uh, okay, we're waiting for spies

06:19:30.460 --> 06:19:37.260
Trade for spade trade me trade mommy trade mommy mommy needs this thing just one, please

06:19:37.580 --> 06:19:39.580
I

06:19:45.260 --> 06:19:47.900
Did make another see I'm happy to see my pee was clear

06:19:48.940 --> 06:19:52.620
um, I don't think I can do endurance my

06:19:54.060 --> 06:19:59.500
My throat is very sore right now. It's very raw and it hurts. Okay

06:20:00.540 --> 06:20:05.820
I'm needing your ink to help me unironically so is my throat. So I think what the deal is

06:20:06.700 --> 06:20:11.740
When mersey goes live, which is in t minus

06:20:13.580 --> 06:20:15.580
Two

06:20:15.820 --> 06:20:19.660
And a half hours for snippets will raid into her

06:20:20.700 --> 06:20:22.700
If that's okay

06:20:22.700 --> 06:20:26.220
Um, there's a spade inside as well. Just woke up. How's runescape going? It's going good

06:20:26.940 --> 06:20:33.580
Um, sadly my voice can't keep up. This is when I get really frustrated for streaming. I could happily stream 12 hours right now

06:20:34.540 --> 06:20:40.780
But it really hurts. Um, okay dropping some poison and fish food. Okay. We'll wait until it looks up

06:20:41.660 --> 06:20:43.660
um

06:20:44.700 --> 06:20:46.700
Honey ink tea honestly

06:20:47.260 --> 06:20:49.260
Mersey's in two hours. Yeah

06:20:49.340 --> 06:20:53.020
All good been having tons of fun and it's already a long stream don't feel bad. Yeah

06:20:53.820 --> 06:20:56.300
What do you mean? This is a baby stream for me. Are you joking me?

06:20:56.780 --> 06:21:02.220
Literally a two-hour stream, which is like the average for a vtuber is like a millisecond in my time

06:21:03.820 --> 06:21:07.340
Like oh, I feel so bad. I'm only going to stream eight hours today. Ah

06:21:08.940 --> 06:21:12.460
I mean, what do you mean? I got to play a multiplayer game with quite

06:21:13.020 --> 06:21:16.940
Literally like how freaking blessed is it to be able to put a multiplayer game

06:21:17.500 --> 06:21:25.660
With reeflings live whilst we're having a carry-on just memin about freaking doing head bang in like I've been dripped out

06:21:25.740 --> 06:21:28.460
I've been getting like gifts and stuff people giving money like

06:21:29.260 --> 06:21:34.620
I'm it's it's not a job. Like I'm this is fun. Like I'm having so much fun

06:21:36.300 --> 06:21:41.500
Oh, I wish there was some sort of secret to like fixing like my voice from vocal strain

06:21:41.660 --> 06:21:44.700
But the sad secret is it's literally just shot up stop talking

06:21:46.060 --> 06:21:48.060
Oh, which is so annoying

06:21:49.180 --> 06:21:53.020
Better to end early than strain your throat. I mean, it's already strained right now, but uh

06:21:53.580 --> 06:22:01.500
What do you mean multiple to ever talking yapping sessions honestly, so she happy happy up. Oh my god, a little spooky boy

06:22:07.180 --> 06:22:09.180
Oh, did you like Emmys cover

06:22:13.500 --> 06:22:16.300
Oh, it's in a mall. Oh, you're young just head off. Oh, that's what I did

06:22:16.860 --> 06:22:21.500
I'm waiting for the fish food to load so the others can grab it back. I don't see it loading

06:22:23.420 --> 06:22:28.860
Having so much fun just hanging out the reef limbs have all the quests done over it. No, the quests are not done

06:22:28.860 --> 06:22:32.460
Please don't worry. We're doing the free quest. Erin is the chicken at the moment

06:22:32.940 --> 06:22:37.900
We've done a hand. Oh god my biggest forehead in the way. Hold on. Let me just close this for a second

06:22:38.380 --> 06:22:42.220
Here is all the quests we've done. So free quest. We've done cooks assistant

06:22:42.620 --> 06:22:45.260
We're doing air big air nice the chicken right now

06:22:46.140 --> 06:22:48.140
We did the mystery

06:22:48.620 --> 06:22:52.780
The restless ghost Romeo and Juliet sheep shearer X marks the spot

06:22:53.100 --> 06:22:59.100
We're finishing Erin is the chicken and then we're going back to update it. Sorry to grind on our cooking stats

06:23:00.220 --> 06:23:06.780
Can't expect you to do constant endurance streams day after day. Sadly. I hate it. I don't like doing short streams

06:23:06.860 --> 06:23:08.860
I just feel so like

06:23:09.580 --> 06:23:11.580
I don't know what the word is like

06:23:12.060 --> 06:23:15.340
I have been yearning for this day

06:23:16.300 --> 06:23:21.980
For an entire year like for this time. Sorry not for this day in particular, but for this time

06:23:23.500 --> 06:23:25.500
um, and it's just like

06:23:26.860 --> 06:23:32.940
It's frustrating that the only reason I can't stream more is because of my voice and not because like I'm tired

06:23:32.940 --> 06:23:37.740
Or I don't feel well or I don't want to type thing. It's frustrating. It's my voice

06:23:38.700 --> 06:23:44.940
That's it. That's the only reason I can't stream like for long because it hurts. It hurts to talk right now

06:23:46.300 --> 06:23:48.700
Uh Jesus, you haven't seen the whole song

06:23:50.940 --> 06:23:52.940
Try to live up to the name, you know

06:23:54.380 --> 06:23:58.860
Uh, I asked for a little bit off the top. Hey, yo, who's the barber?

06:24:00.220 --> 06:24:03.740
Man, we gotta go both. Okay. The poison isn't loading on the floor for me

06:24:03.820 --> 06:24:09.500
But I think we'll do it. So as long as you guys have accepted the quest, we're gonna go inside now refling

06:24:09.740 --> 06:24:15.660
It's taking nice and slow. I think the trees hit you on the way past. So just be careful

06:24:15.660 --> 06:24:17.660
You don't stray from the path too much

06:24:18.060 --> 06:24:21.100
Assume we're supposed to go. Ah the tree freaking went for me

06:24:21.820 --> 06:24:23.820
Open large door

06:24:24.300 --> 06:24:26.300
Okay

06:24:27.340 --> 06:24:29.340
Oh the there's like haunted thing

06:24:30.380 --> 06:24:34.940
Where are we supposed to go get the gauge and tube? Where is that?

06:24:34.940 --> 06:24:39.340
Uh, and not here. Maybe it's upstairs

06:24:43.020 --> 06:24:45.580
Okay, we uh, uh, I'm gonna wait until

06:24:46.460 --> 06:24:48.140
Oh

06:24:48.140 --> 06:24:50.140
Oh, that's not good

06:24:50.140 --> 06:24:54.540
Wait, I'm just gonna check all the reflins made it in go up the stairs reflins when you come inside

06:24:56.860 --> 06:24:58.860
Is that the last refling

06:24:59.580 --> 06:25:01.580
Oh

06:25:03.260 --> 06:25:05.260
Who's that?

06:25:06.220 --> 06:25:08.860
I think that's the last refling. We all need to go upstairs

06:25:10.540 --> 06:25:15.100
How are you even there the chairs attacking him? Oh my god, that chair being your ass

06:25:19.020 --> 06:25:21.020
Uh, okay that

06:25:22.620 --> 06:25:24.620
I'll go up the stairs. Okay. Um

06:25:25.100 --> 06:25:26.540
Oh

06:25:26.540 --> 06:25:33.580
He like oh someone's beating them up. Wait, where are we supposed to go up here up these stairs to the left as soon as we come up

06:25:36.460 --> 06:25:42.140
Nothing's being highlighted for me ruin light. You're failing me. Am I supposed to hear talk to the professor?

06:25:46.060 --> 06:25:48.060
Be careful

06:25:48.300 --> 06:25:49.740
Brian

06:25:49.740 --> 06:25:56.540
It frustrates you because you can't control it and that's the most frustrating thing not being able to control something

06:25:57.420 --> 06:26:03.260
Thank you iron weeper for the tip and yeah, just like uh really is telling you to use

06:26:06.060 --> 06:26:10.780
All right hold on oh no, I'm mixing up hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on

06:26:10.780 --> 06:26:18.780
That's not so easy, well look at them, dip, dip, dip, dip, oh maybe I should be reading

06:26:18.780 --> 06:26:19.780
that out.

06:26:19.780 --> 06:26:20.780
What would that say?

06:26:20.780 --> 06:26:25.740
Roonlake is telling you to use your poison on your fish food, okay, okay I have poison

06:26:25.740 --> 06:26:29.780
fish food, right now I won't.

06:26:29.780 --> 06:26:33.380
Just hypnotize yourself, Strony trust me I love you and enjoy every second but your health

06:26:33.380 --> 06:26:34.380
doesn't pour in.

06:26:34.380 --> 06:26:38.100
Yeah, like as long as my voice doesn't break then I'm good to go.

06:26:39.100 --> 06:26:47.100
Where, where is this freaking map telling me to go, I'm so good to go, I wanna go.

06:26:47.100 --> 06:26:52.100
We were to go outside, oh right okay.

06:26:52.100 --> 06:26:56.100
Oh no sorry, close the map, not close one's view.

06:26:56.100 --> 06:27:06.100
Right, so go downstairs, okay, come downstairs, poison the fish food and then come back out

06:27:06.100 --> 06:27:08.100
of the mansion.

06:27:08.100 --> 06:27:14.100
Okay, oh this is a rough one to do together I think so if you've not got it.

06:27:14.100 --> 06:27:21.100
The door won't open over here, oh okay okay okay, how do I get over there?

06:27:21.100 --> 06:27:25.100
Wait open the door, the chair beating you up?

06:27:25.100 --> 06:27:28.100
Oh no they just run around, I thought the chair was like beating you up in the game

06:27:29.100 --> 06:27:38.100
Oh there's a rubber tube, I get it, get the gauge in the tube.

06:27:38.100 --> 06:27:43.100
Oh my god, open the door, what's that?

06:27:43.100 --> 06:27:47.100
Oh I'm actually kinda scared of that.

06:27:47.100 --> 06:27:52.100
Wait I can't go in, the door's locked, oh right okay.

06:27:52.100 --> 06:27:57.100
Someone's dropped a speed ahead if you need it by the way.

06:27:57.100 --> 06:28:02.100
We're taking the long way around.

06:28:02.100 --> 06:28:06.100
Okay I'm glad the chairs don't beat you up because honestly death by chairs is pretty embarrassing.

06:28:06.100 --> 06:28:13.100
Right open the door, or I'm gonna throw rocks through your window.

06:28:13.100 --> 06:28:19.100
Open the door, okay so one by one door but we need to get the key first.

06:28:19.100 --> 06:28:26.100
Well she's a stubborn one but I guess she's up till the day she can take care of herself to some fish so hard.

06:28:26.100 --> 06:28:32.100
Okay okay we're now outside, this is a very hard one to follow quest-wise.

06:28:32.100 --> 06:28:37.100
Especially if you're at a rune-like, rune-crafting guild, stop.

06:28:37.100 --> 06:28:43.100
Are you telling someone that we're rune-crafting guild?

06:28:43.100 --> 06:28:50.100
Okay I'm just follow the Easter bunny, follow the bunny, the bunny, the bunny, follow the Easter bunny,

06:28:51.100 --> 06:28:57.100
search compost heap, I love it, a bit of cheeky vandalism.

06:28:57.100 --> 06:29:00.100
Okay we did it, oh what did I do?

06:29:00.100 --> 06:29:10.100
You find a small key, okay and now, okay.

06:29:10.100 --> 06:29:15.100
Oh there's a thing ahead, okay there's a fountain ahead, I don't know, is that already from here?

06:29:15.100 --> 06:29:18.100
I feel like someone's probably stuck in the house right now.

06:29:18.100 --> 06:29:21.100
As long as you try and come outside then you'll be fine.

06:29:21.100 --> 06:29:25.100
So as long as you've all got the key, come to the fountain next.

06:29:25.100 --> 06:29:31.100
There's a fountain through the trees, the trees might whip you but you should survive, like it's literally one HP at least.

06:29:31.100 --> 06:29:36.100
Poisoned fish food on the fountain, use on the fountain.

06:29:36.100 --> 06:29:42.100
Oh the tree just made a noise, use it on the fountain.

06:29:42.100 --> 06:29:49.100
Okay, the piranhas start eating the food then dine float to the surface.

06:29:49.100 --> 06:29:56.100
And then search the fountain, there seems to be a pressure gauge in here and a lot of dead fish.

06:29:56.100 --> 06:30:01.100
Well yeah you just roll them, smoke them.

06:30:01.100 --> 06:30:05.100
Come outside, yes I see, I see.

06:30:05.100 --> 06:30:10.100
Okay once we've all stopped head banging into the fountain.

06:30:10.100 --> 06:30:14.100
And then we go back into the house.

06:30:14.100 --> 06:30:18.100
Anyone got some spare poison fish?

06:30:18.100 --> 06:30:22.100
Ah the poison was in the house I think.

06:30:22.100 --> 06:30:27.100
Wait we're outside the house, how do we get back in? Why is it making me go around in a circle?

06:30:27.100 --> 06:30:36.100
I'm spinning around, get out of my way.

06:30:36.100 --> 06:30:41.100
I didn't think for how much time you prepared for this by the way, how is it, is it like you expected?

06:30:41.100 --> 06:30:44.100
To me you're having a lot of fun but maybe you have more to say.

06:30:44.100 --> 06:30:49.100
On RuneScape? I'm getting whipped by a tree, sorry, sorry Ruflin's getting whipped by a tree because of me, sorry.

06:30:49.100 --> 06:30:55.100
I mean RuneScape it took a little second to like get ready to stream out, that wasn't that bad.

06:30:55.100 --> 06:30:59.100
Scale it in time, you just have to run in and pick the chip then run out.

06:30:59.100 --> 06:31:03.100
Okay should we take it in turns, who wants to go first?

06:31:04.100 --> 06:31:08.100
Ah fuck it I'll go first, I'll need a lead by example.

06:31:08.100 --> 06:31:16.100
Okay grab the chip and then, okay I got whacked for two so just make sure you get out in time.

06:31:16.100 --> 06:31:19.100
Would you prefer to be whipped by a tree?

06:31:19.100 --> 06:31:23.100
Is it instance or are we going to have to wait for that to reload?

06:31:23.100 --> 06:31:25.100
Oh no you've got it, you've got it, okay it's fine.

06:31:25.100 --> 06:31:29.100
Oh he beat him up, he said nah hold on let me do this Ruflin's I got this.

06:31:29.100 --> 06:31:34.100
He's going to skillspec him, he's going to skillspec, he's going to do the little twirl thing.

06:31:34.100 --> 06:31:39.100
Oh streaming in general has been absolutely fantastic, it's gone exactly the way I wanted it to.

06:31:39.100 --> 06:31:47.100
Like I love streams Nathan and I love long streams and yapping people's heads off and it's just gone absolutely amazing.

06:31:50.100 --> 06:31:57.100
Just fantastic, for me I don't like the mega super professional streams don't mind me.

06:31:57.100 --> 06:32:02.100
Some people really like it, let's go, has everyone got it?

06:32:02.100 --> 06:32:08.100
Thank you Ruflin for killing the skelly boy, has everyone got the rubber tube?

06:32:08.100 --> 06:32:16.100
I don't think everyone's got it, I don't know if it's been a bit funny but you should be able to go in and get the rubber tube now that you've got the key.

06:32:18.100 --> 06:32:24.100
Oh someone's getting attacked over there, there's a Ruflin, did a Ruflin, oh I thought a Ruflin just perished there.

06:32:24.100 --> 06:32:26.100
I'm happy to hear that, yeah.

06:32:27.100 --> 06:32:31.100
There is nothing like, yeah professional streams, where's the fish food?

06:32:39.100 --> 06:32:43.100
Upstairs is the fish food, Ruflin, someone says.

06:32:45.100 --> 06:32:49.100
Okay I'll wait here until the other Ruflins are caught up because it's not fair to skip ahead.

06:32:50.100 --> 06:32:54.100
I like when funny Scott women yapt to me for hours, simple as, nothing more.

06:32:54.100 --> 06:33:00.100
Now people really enjoy professional streams from other people which is great but for me I'm just like...

06:33:09.100 --> 06:33:13.100
Oh we're getting two heads bang, yo I'm starting to think this is getting, hold on.

06:33:13.100 --> 06:33:18.100
Oh no I can't wait, let me zoom up a bit, let me take one more step for no particular reason at all.

06:33:18.100 --> 06:33:21.100
Okay let me take one more step for no particular reason at all.

06:33:22.100 --> 06:33:24.100
Because it's absolutely no reason at all.

06:33:29.100 --> 06:33:32.100
We are literal children, this is terrible.

06:33:33.100 --> 06:33:38.100
That awful getting, hey hey hey he dancing on it, he dancing on it, he doing the split on it.

06:33:43.100 --> 06:33:45.100
I love your silly yapping.

06:33:46.100 --> 06:33:48.100
Oh my god a ghost is going for it.

06:33:53.100 --> 06:33:55.100
Is there a Rufling on the outskirts?

06:33:55.100 --> 06:33:59.100
Aw I think I'm too far away to be able to see if someone's at the compost heap right now.

06:34:00.100 --> 06:34:03.100
Oh no someone's getting beaten up, oh no it's not him though.

06:34:04.100 --> 06:34:08.100
I have salmon if you want a Rufling that's literally protecting us all.

06:34:09.100 --> 06:34:13.100
There's salmon juice, whoa what is that? Oh is that for me?

06:34:14.100 --> 06:34:18.100
Wait should I do this in the middle? I don't know what he does.

06:34:19.100 --> 06:34:24.100
Scottlefish are you there? Should I do it or no? I don't know if the old man's got a good quest or not.

06:34:26.100 --> 06:34:27.100
Did I talk to him?

06:34:30.100 --> 06:34:32.100
Do it, okay someone says do it.

06:34:32.100 --> 06:34:36.100
Oh there you are, I hoped you would talk to me, I get so lonely, I have a present I must get going now.

06:34:38.100 --> 06:34:41.100
Oh he just gave me an uncut emerald, I didn't even ask anything.

06:34:43.100 --> 06:34:46.100
Oh don't mind if I do, I thought he was going to like whiff to me are we?

06:34:51.100 --> 06:34:55.100
Oh I see the poison, whoa poison's like 700.

06:34:56.100 --> 06:35:00.100
Well I know where the poison is if anyone needs to know it's by the left.

06:35:01.100 --> 06:35:02.100
There's your comment.

06:35:04.100 --> 06:35:06.100
Does he need help?

06:35:14.100 --> 06:35:16.100
You wish to trade with me, what do you wish to trade?

06:35:17.100 --> 06:35:23.100
Oh you're giving it, oh the diamonds, how you call them?

06:35:25.100 --> 06:35:30.100
I don't know the rocks in the ground, where are these called? It's not jewelry but they're rocks.

06:35:32.100 --> 06:35:36.100
Where are diamonds category? Where's the category of ruby and plaffa and that?

06:35:37.100 --> 06:35:39.100
Gemstones, oh my god I forgot that word there.

06:35:39.100 --> 06:35:45.100
Jeez Louise, I literally forgot the word gems there, I apologise.

06:35:46.100 --> 06:35:51.100
Watch ads showed up tipped and left, or in gemstones, I got out.

06:35:52.100 --> 06:35:53.100
Oh god we're all headbanging.

06:35:54.100 --> 06:35:58.100
Are you practicing later for when the next 10 audios come out?

06:35:58.100 --> 06:36:00.100
Wait where is that headbanging?

06:36:00.100 --> 06:36:01.100
Headbanging.

06:36:05.100 --> 06:36:09.100
Oh my god we really are a cult clearly, look at us go.

06:36:13.100 --> 06:36:17.100
Oh do you need health? Holy crap you need health like right now.

06:36:18.100 --> 06:36:20.100
I've got salmon, this should heal you up.

06:36:22.100 --> 06:36:23.100
Go go go.

06:36:24.100 --> 06:36:27.100
Is there any wreathlings, oh no they're self healing.

06:36:28.100 --> 06:36:31.100
Is there any wreathlings on the outskirts? I can't really tell.

06:36:32.100 --> 06:36:37.100
I don't want to go ahead in case there's someone outside doing that fountain bit.

06:36:39.100 --> 06:36:41.100
Is everyone here? Did we make it?

06:36:42.100 --> 06:36:46.100
If there's a wreathling, who did that? Who did that?

06:36:47.100 --> 06:36:48.100
That was you?

06:36:48.100 --> 06:36:51.100
Okay we're reporting you for harassment.

06:36:53.100 --> 06:36:56.100
Interesting we're in sync for me but on stream.

06:36:57.100 --> 06:36:59.100
My ping is really high to everyone.

06:37:00.100 --> 06:37:03.100
They've had plenty of time, yeah is everyone here I think so.

06:37:04.100 --> 06:37:08.100
Hi hi how's stream going? It's been going amazing, look at me and the wreathling gang we're doing questing.

06:37:09.100 --> 06:37:15.100
Okay I think everyone's got the plastic tube, they get the gauge and tube, get the oil can next.

06:37:15.100 --> 06:37:19.100
So open this door and we'll go through.

06:37:20.100 --> 06:37:23.100
Okay I think we're all ready.

06:37:25.100 --> 06:37:29.100
Don't have the tube but also got the gauge but you don't have the tube.

06:37:30.100 --> 06:37:31.100
I do have the tube.

06:37:33.100 --> 06:37:39.100
Okay we need to interact with this blue thing over here but you've not got the tube? Who's not got the tube?

06:37:39.100 --> 06:37:40.100
Who's not got the tube?

06:37:45.100 --> 06:37:47.100
Tube you just run in and pick up when it spawns.

06:37:49.100 --> 06:37:52.100
Go in the closet and get the rubber if you don't have- oh!

06:37:53.100 --> 06:37:54.100
I shouldn't have said that.

06:37:57.100 --> 06:38:02.100
Oh my god the ShadowbanTV's Twitter, all of our Twitter's looks like a Shadowban, it's ridiculous.

06:38:03.100 --> 06:38:04.100
Like how sensitive it is.

06:38:09.100 --> 06:38:10.100
Ah.

06:38:12.100 --> 06:38:14.100
Oh what's that? It's a big thing.

06:38:15.100 --> 06:38:16.100
Oh it's gone.

06:38:17.100 --> 06:38:20.100
Did you get the tube? Did you get the tube? I think so.

06:38:21.100 --> 06:38:22.100
Alright fun part of the quest let's go!

06:38:23.100 --> 06:38:25.100
Let's go- oh the door- the door's fine.

06:38:26.100 --> 06:38:28.100
Oh wait hold on sorry I probably just closed that door on you.

06:38:29.100 --> 06:38:30.100
Okay search the bookcase.

06:38:32.100 --> 06:38:33.100
Search the bookcase.

06:38:34.100 --> 06:38:36.100
Oh is that one by one? Maybe a one by one moment, hold on.

06:38:37.100 --> 06:38:38.100
Hey let's go.

06:38:39.100 --> 06:38:40.100
Okay go down the ladder.

06:38:41.100 --> 06:38:42.100
Oh wait go down the ladder when you're ready is that everyone?

06:38:43.100 --> 06:38:44.100
Yeah that's everyone.

06:38:45.100 --> 06:38:46.100
Once you get through the bookshelf.

06:38:47.100 --> 06:38:50.100
Okay we did it the whole gang's here.

06:38:51.100 --> 06:38:52.100
No refling left behind.

06:38:55.100 --> 06:38:57.100
Oh my god we're beating up the rats literally.

06:38:58.100 --> 06:38:59.100
Oh god what do we do?

06:39:00.100 --> 06:39:01.100
Okay there's a lever on the wall.

06:39:02.100 --> 06:39:04.100
Pull lever alpha on the wall over here.

06:39:06.100 --> 06:39:08.100
I assume this is going to be instanced to us?

06:39:09.100 --> 06:39:10.100
So I don't know.

06:39:11.100 --> 06:39:13.100
And then pull lever Bravo!

06:39:16.100 --> 06:39:17.100
Oh the music's all like-

06:39:20.100 --> 06:39:21.100
Okay.

06:39:22.100 --> 06:39:24.100
Now this gate is a jar.

06:39:27.100 --> 06:39:31.100
And English if it's like slightly open it's a jar.

06:39:32.100 --> 06:39:33.100
Pull lever D.

06:39:33.100 --> 06:39:36.100
Oh I'll pull the D lever all day long.

06:39:37.100 --> 06:39:38.100
Come over here weak one.

06:39:41.100 --> 06:39:42.100
What did that do?

06:39:43.100 --> 06:39:44.100
Okay.

06:39:46.100 --> 06:39:48.100
Oh god it's a one by one gate.

06:39:49.100 --> 06:39:52.100
Why is there a biggest issue right now a one by one gate?

06:39:56.100 --> 06:39:59.100
Oil can has a slow respawn as well.

06:40:00.100 --> 06:40:02.100
I think we all need an oil can.

06:40:03.100 --> 06:40:05.100
So we're just gonna have to go for it and be patient.

06:40:06.100 --> 06:40:07.100
I'm sure you can wait.

06:40:08.100 --> 06:40:10.100
I don't know if all the levers are the same for everyone.

06:40:11.100 --> 06:40:14.100
It looks like you guys are going different ways so I think it might be different.

06:40:19.100 --> 06:40:22.100
World hop when you get into the room and then hop back.

06:40:24.100 --> 06:40:29.100
Yeah you guys are really going different ways for me so I think it's different for everyone.

06:40:30.100 --> 06:40:33.100
Oh the classic one by one gate it's ogre.

06:40:34.100 --> 06:40:36.100
Lever solution is the same for everyone.

06:40:36.100 --> 06:40:37.100
How is everyone going to wait?

06:40:37.100 --> 06:40:39.100
Are you guys juicing this one?

06:40:41.100 --> 06:40:43.100
That way everyone can grab it faster.

06:40:43.100 --> 06:40:44.100
Yes.

06:40:46.100 --> 06:40:47.100
Okay.

06:40:47.100 --> 06:40:48.100
Okay.

06:40:53.100 --> 06:40:54.100
Okay.

06:40:54.100 --> 06:40:58.100
Okay I love this moonlight plugin because if I had to do this by my brain

06:40:58.100 --> 06:40:59.100
it would be over.

06:41:09.100 --> 06:41:11.100
This is crazy.

06:41:15.100 --> 06:41:17.100
All levers are unique in their own way.

06:41:17.100 --> 06:41:18.100
Exactly.

06:41:22.100 --> 06:41:23.100
Let's see.

06:41:23.100 --> 06:41:24.100
Pull this lever.

06:41:24.100 --> 06:41:25.100
We're almost done?

06:41:25.100 --> 06:41:28.100
Okay I was going to say that's like a lot of freaking question.

06:41:28.100 --> 06:41:30.100
Oh wait sorry this one.

06:41:31.100 --> 06:41:34.100
I'm going to see if my tea is at an acceptable temperature if I'm going to scold myself on it.

06:41:34.100 --> 06:41:36.100
That's why there's one or the other.

06:41:44.100 --> 06:41:45.100
All these doors.

06:41:47.100 --> 06:41:48.100
Alright.

06:41:51.100 --> 06:41:54.100
Am I taking it and then you guys are world hopping?

06:41:55.100 --> 06:41:56.100
Okay.

06:41:58.100 --> 06:42:00.100
And then you're coming back to this world?

06:42:03.100 --> 06:42:04.100
Yeah this track is...

06:42:10.100 --> 06:42:13.100
Gen 2 based after old school runescape tracks?

06:42:13.100 --> 06:42:14.100
Question mark.

06:42:16.100 --> 06:42:18.100
Oh wait I should be facing you today.

06:42:20.100 --> 06:42:22.100
Honestly I wouldn't mind that.

06:42:22.100 --> 06:42:23.100
I'm kind of down for that.

06:42:23.100 --> 06:42:28.100
I was actually thinking of Legend of Zelda Minish Cap

06:42:28.100 --> 06:42:33.100
but brought you know to kind of modern standards for Gen 2

06:42:33.100 --> 06:42:34.100
but honestly runescape?

06:42:34.100 --> 06:42:36.100
Runescape always do.

06:42:38.100 --> 06:42:42.100
If we had like a mischievous little brat thing this song

06:42:42.100 --> 06:42:44.100
was kind of like...

06:42:44.100 --> 06:42:47.100
not circus- I guess it's circus-esque.

06:42:48.100 --> 06:42:50.100
Does everyone have an oil can?

06:42:50.100 --> 06:42:51.100
Or...

06:42:51.100 --> 06:42:53.100
Oh there's a respawn.

06:42:53.100 --> 06:42:55.100
Well that took a whole second.

06:42:55.100 --> 06:42:57.100
Everyone got an oil can?

06:42:57.100 --> 06:42:59.100
Yeah no you're taking it now.

06:43:00.100 --> 06:43:04.100
Okay if you have an oil can come back out to the center over here.

06:43:04.100 --> 06:43:08.100
If you don't have an oil can wait for it to spawn in that room

06:43:08.100 --> 06:43:10.100
or you can do what's called world hopping

06:43:10.100 --> 06:43:13.100
where you purposely swap to a new world

06:43:13.100 --> 06:43:16.100
and it should be like a new instant.

06:43:16.100 --> 06:43:19.100
But if you have an oil can you're allowed to come out here.

06:43:20.100 --> 06:43:22.100
Minish is 20 years old now.

06:43:22.100 --> 06:43:24.100
Stubious brat.

06:43:26.100 --> 06:43:27.100
Eh I would watch Zelda.

06:43:27.100 --> 06:43:28.100
That's an idea.

06:43:28.100 --> 06:43:29.100
I will uncontroll.

06:43:29.100 --> 06:43:32.100
Oh unconditionally support whoever gets sea shanty.

06:43:32.100 --> 06:43:34.100
No it has to be like hidden

06:43:34.100 --> 06:43:37.100
but when you know what it is you know.

06:43:37.100 --> 06:43:39.100
Oh there's a reefling there.

06:43:39.100 --> 06:43:41.100
We're not ready yet.

06:43:41.100 --> 06:43:43.100
I'll just check if anyone's back here.

06:43:43.100 --> 06:43:44.100
Other than that reefling.

06:43:44.100 --> 06:43:45.100
Oh there's one there.

06:43:45.100 --> 06:43:46.100
And one there.

06:43:47.100 --> 06:43:48.100
I was just straight up reefling.

06:43:48.100 --> 06:43:50.100
You actually got the name reefling.

06:43:50.100 --> 06:43:51.100
I'm surprised no one else took it.

06:43:51.100 --> 06:43:52.100
I don't know that thing about it.

06:43:52.100 --> 06:43:54.100
I guess we'll just beat up.

06:43:54.100 --> 06:43:55.100
We're gonna beat up rats out here.

06:43:55.100 --> 06:43:58.100
Okay we're just gonna get our combat level a bit higher.

06:43:58.100 --> 06:44:00.100
Oh I just leveled up.

06:44:00.100 --> 06:44:01.100
What did I get?

06:44:01.100 --> 06:44:02.100
I got a Taksix.

06:44:02.100 --> 06:44:04.100
Oh there's spiders as well.

06:44:04.100 --> 06:44:06.100
Yeah let's just level up our combat a little bit.

06:44:06.100 --> 06:44:07.100
Why not?

06:44:09.100 --> 06:44:11.100
Us following her gives me

06:44:11.100 --> 06:44:14.100
Ugandan knuckles flashbacks.

06:44:14.100 --> 06:44:16.100
This beat only fake queen.

06:44:18.100 --> 06:44:20.100
Would you hum shanti?

06:44:40.100 --> 06:44:42.100
Yeah I managed to get the reefling name

06:44:42.100 --> 06:44:44.100
still five hours in ancient...

06:44:46.100 --> 06:44:48.100
That's sea shanti.

06:44:49.100 --> 06:44:51.100
We're just leveling up our combat.

06:44:52.100 --> 06:44:54.100
There's still a reefling over there getting absolutely...

06:44:54.100 --> 06:44:56.100
What are you getting annihilated by?

06:44:56.100 --> 06:44:57.100
A rat?

06:44:57.100 --> 06:44:58.100
Oh okay that's fine.

06:44:59.100 --> 06:45:00.100
There's one there.

06:45:00.100 --> 06:45:01.100
There's a third?

06:45:01.100 --> 06:45:02.100
Yeah.

06:45:02.100 --> 06:45:04.100
We've got Hatsumiku chilling over there.

06:45:08.100 --> 06:45:09.100
Reefling there.

06:45:10.100 --> 06:45:12.100
Now we have a max roll.

06:45:15.100 --> 06:45:16.100
Get some level.

06:45:16.100 --> 06:45:18.100
No way that rat just dunked my shield.

06:45:18.100 --> 06:45:19.100
I went bonk.

06:45:20.100 --> 06:45:22.100
Yeah and we would have chosen

06:45:22.100 --> 06:45:23.100
Dewey.

06:45:24.100 --> 06:45:25.100
Chocho is Dewey.

06:45:25.100 --> 06:45:26.100
You have found Dewey.

06:45:26.100 --> 06:45:29.100
I remember that meme went like absolutely viral.

06:45:29.100 --> 06:45:32.100
Someone said that was the start of the brain rot meta

06:45:32.100 --> 06:45:34.100
when it comes to memes.

06:45:36.100 --> 06:45:38.100
Which I found rather unsafe.

06:45:40.100 --> 06:45:41.100
Wow.

06:45:43.100 --> 06:45:45.100
I think there's someone else that's fighting that.

06:45:45.100 --> 06:45:46.100
Here we go.

06:45:48.100 --> 06:45:51.100
We've almost got all of our cans.

06:45:51.100 --> 06:45:53.100
And then we'll level up on fishing.

06:45:53.100 --> 06:45:54.100
I keep saying fishing.

06:45:54.100 --> 06:45:55.100
It's not fishing.

06:45:55.100 --> 06:45:56.100
We're doing kooten.

06:45:59.100 --> 06:46:00.100
My PC's fan just started up.

06:46:00.100 --> 06:46:02.100
I get nervous when my PC's...

06:46:02.100 --> 06:46:03.100
I'm like what's wrong?

06:46:03.100 --> 06:46:04.100
What's wrong?

06:46:07.100 --> 06:46:08.100
Oh!

06:46:08.100 --> 06:46:10.100
Last reefling that needs to can?

06:46:10.100 --> 06:46:11.100
The question mark?

06:46:11.100 --> 06:46:13.100
I don't see anyone else doing the levers.

06:46:13.100 --> 06:46:14.100
Am I going crazy?

06:46:14.100 --> 06:46:15.100
Or are we clear?

06:46:15.100 --> 06:46:16.100
Have we did it?

06:46:16.100 --> 06:46:18.100
Are we ready to move on?

06:46:18.100 --> 06:46:21.100
Are we stunting on as they're dancing?

06:46:21.100 --> 06:46:22.100
Okay.

06:46:22.100 --> 06:46:24.100
If everyone's got a can, up the ladders please.

06:46:24.100 --> 06:46:25.100
Little reeflings.

06:46:25.100 --> 06:46:27.100
If everyone's got a can.

06:46:27.100 --> 06:46:28.100
Oh wait no!

06:46:28.100 --> 06:46:29.100
Sorry!

06:46:29.100 --> 06:46:30.100
Sorry!

06:46:30.100 --> 06:46:31.100
There's one more.

06:46:31.100 --> 06:46:32.100
Sorry.

06:46:32.100 --> 06:46:33.100
There's one more reefling.

06:46:33.100 --> 06:46:34.100
I'm sorry.

06:46:34.100 --> 06:46:35.100
I debated you.

06:46:35.100 --> 06:46:36.100
There's one more reefling.

06:46:37.100 --> 06:46:40.100
I think they're still doing the lever stage.

06:46:40.100 --> 06:46:41.100
I'm sorry reefling.

06:46:41.100 --> 06:46:42.100
I debated you.

06:46:42.100 --> 06:46:45.100
You can come back down and we'll keep killing the means.

06:46:49.100 --> 06:46:51.100
He's getting absolutely beaten up by that rat.

06:46:51.100 --> 06:46:52.100
See I'll help you out.

06:46:52.100 --> 06:46:53.100
There you go.

06:47:02.100 --> 06:47:04.100
Did you get it?

06:47:04.100 --> 06:47:05.100
I don't know.

06:47:07.100 --> 06:47:08.100
Did you get it?

06:47:08.100 --> 06:47:10.100
You're moving around erratically.

06:47:10.100 --> 06:47:12.100
Is the reefling...

06:47:15.100 --> 06:47:16.100
I don't know.

06:47:16.100 --> 06:47:18.100
Are you stuck on the levers?

06:47:18.100 --> 06:47:19.100
You're not taping.

06:47:23.100 --> 06:47:24.100
Go on.

06:47:24.100 --> 06:47:25.100
I'll catch up.

06:47:25.100 --> 06:47:26.100
Are you sure reeflings?

06:47:26.100 --> 06:47:28.100
I don't want to feel anyone feel left out.

06:47:30.100 --> 06:47:32.100
VR chat was wailed.

06:47:32.100 --> 06:47:34.100
No it's just a feel of weird.

06:47:34.100 --> 06:47:39.100
I was going to have to play VR chat to learn how the 3D models work.

06:47:39.100 --> 06:47:42.100
I have no idea how that 3D model streaming works.

06:47:43.100 --> 06:47:46.100
I don't know if you can use other programs as well.

06:47:47.100 --> 06:47:50.100
I'm leveling combat not to brag about it.

06:47:56.100 --> 06:47:57.100
You will learn.

06:47:57.100 --> 06:47:59.100
Can you say era again?

06:47:59.100 --> 06:48:00.100
Era?

06:48:01.100 --> 06:48:02.100
Era.

06:48:02.100 --> 06:48:03.100
Era.

06:48:05.100 --> 06:48:07.100
Errot switch and tracks.

06:48:07.100 --> 06:48:09.100
You don't need to use VR chat for 3D models?

06:48:10.100 --> 06:48:13.100
I honestly don't know anything about it.

06:48:13.100 --> 06:48:16.100
Girls want 3D models and I'll pay for it.

06:48:16.100 --> 06:48:18.100
That's pretty much all I know about 3D models.

06:48:18.100 --> 06:48:20.100
I'm joking.

06:48:20.100 --> 06:48:22.100
Just say you want 3D models and we'll get it.

06:48:26.100 --> 06:48:28.100
VR hypnotize and interest and...

06:48:29.100 --> 06:48:30.100
Oh!

06:48:30.100 --> 06:48:33.100
I saw VR ASMR videos.

06:48:33.100 --> 06:48:35.100
I thought that was pretty cool

06:48:36.940 --> 06:48:41.980
And plus it would cool to see the height difference of the girls as well go on y'all find you

06:48:44.060 --> 06:48:48.780
Okay, okay, we're being sent away by the reflying right upstairs everyone we're being sent away

06:48:50.860 --> 06:48:55.420
Upstairs, okay, there's a lever here pool another crunk

06:48:56.140 --> 06:48:58.140
Oh

06:48:59.420 --> 06:49:05.660
Okay, okay, okay, right we need to go up the stairs again. Right. Let's go back here. I'm a sip my tea

06:49:10.140 --> 06:49:15.660
You literally talk like a real mummy with the girls they want 3d models. Yeah, I'll just pay for it darlin

06:49:15.740 --> 06:49:19.180
There you go darlin holiers. I don't know what it's about, but you just enjoy yourself

06:49:19.500 --> 06:49:25.180
It's true. They'll be like I want this. I'm like, oh, you just oh, you get it. See you just enjoy yourself, hen

06:49:27.340 --> 06:49:34.140
Uh, right. Okay. Talk to the professor at the top of the stairs. Oh, you found anything yet? I have everything give him to me here then

06:49:35.180 --> 06:49:37.180
All his oh you put them

06:49:38.540 --> 06:49:43.020
Noises are being made. Oh, he's a man. Thank you, madam. I was dreadfully

06:49:43.500 --> 06:49:47.740
Irritating being a chicken. How can I ever thank you? Well a cash reward is always nice

06:49:48.140 --> 06:49:50.140
Of course, of course

06:49:50.220 --> 06:49:52.940
You're awarded four quest points of 300 coins

06:49:53.820 --> 06:49:57.020
Oh really quick other than like the horrific

06:49:57.820 --> 06:49:59.820
Issues that was like a really quick quest

06:50:01.900 --> 06:50:05.980
Um, right we're not doing any more quests then we're leveling up next

06:50:06.860 --> 06:50:08.860
Money, let's go

06:50:08.940 --> 06:50:13.740
What is this pressure gauge? Don't touch it. It's gonna explode. Where we do

06:50:14.860 --> 06:50:16.860
What pressure gauge?

06:50:18.620 --> 06:50:24.380
Mm-hmm. Is there like any other scientific things? Nah, I guess that's it and we just leave

06:50:25.980 --> 06:50:27.980
But that

06:50:28.220 --> 06:50:30.780
It's in the fountain. That's why you need to poison it. How bizarre

06:50:32.540 --> 06:50:34.540
Oh, there's the fish food

06:50:36.220 --> 06:50:39.500
I guess that's it. We're already we're already freaking doing this quest. Hold on.

06:50:40.220 --> 06:50:41.980
Wow

06:50:41.980 --> 06:50:44.460
Oh wait, why why did you not let me out that door?

06:50:45.020 --> 06:50:50.220
Open large door. Wait, why does it make me turn backwards?

06:50:53.020 --> 06:50:56.700
I keep it doesn't let me have this door open large door

06:50:57.820 --> 06:51:00.140
It won't open front door is one way

06:51:01.340 --> 06:51:05.180
Whoa. Oh, so we have to like go all the way around again. Oh, okay

06:51:07.260 --> 06:51:11.740
Brother interesting take from the deputy. All right, let me let me sip into my teeth

06:51:15.420 --> 06:51:21.740
Okay, yeah, I'll go another one by one door. It's over. I like the chairs like chase you

06:51:23.740 --> 06:51:28.460
Do you can you even go that way? Oh you can you can come around the this side?

06:51:30.460 --> 06:51:33.660
Can you teach me what to play rinse game tempo?

06:51:36.300 --> 06:51:38.300
Get right go ahead back

06:51:38.780 --> 06:51:40.780
Oh

06:51:41.820 --> 06:51:43.820
The tree

06:51:43.980 --> 06:51:47.260
I don't want to go into fight move. What's going on? Why can't I move?

06:51:48.780 --> 06:51:50.780
Hello

06:51:52.220 --> 06:51:58.220
Am I missing why can I not why that tree literally had me in a death grip. Oh my gosh

06:52:01.740 --> 06:52:03.740
Mostly was a guy a fan

06:52:04.540 --> 06:52:07.580
Don't get skill checked by a tree literally one arrow

06:52:08.540 --> 06:52:11.900
There. I think the tree liked you honestly

06:52:13.900 --> 06:52:19.900
Okay, we made it but I don't think that's all the reeflings man going outside is dangerous. Literally. Oh, there's a reason there

06:52:22.060 --> 06:52:27.820
Right, we'll wait until a cool army. I have an army of reeflings requesting but we're about to go level up or cooking next

06:52:28.940 --> 06:52:31.420
I'm trying to try to finish my honey tea before it gets cold

06:52:31.900 --> 06:52:33.900
Oh

06:52:35.500 --> 06:52:37.500
Okay, um

06:52:37.500 --> 06:52:42.380
Next thing we're going to do is we're going to travel north. We're going to take a

06:52:43.100 --> 06:52:45.660
A west and then north and we're going to be outside

06:52:46.300 --> 06:52:47.900
Uh the village

06:52:47.900 --> 06:52:51.900
But we need to go get fishing rods and stuff. I don't think there's a fish shop nearby

06:52:52.300 --> 06:52:55.260
So I think we're going to go to the grand exchange and buy fishing rods

06:52:56.060 --> 06:53:00.860
Army definitely not cool. This music is giving me a

06:53:02.620 --> 06:53:04.620
Fatal dose of nostalgia

06:53:05.740 --> 06:53:08.300
Pass so much since the last get rector is

06:53:11.340 --> 06:53:14.940
As I get stuck and fling fast and fly I never got anywhere

06:53:15.500 --> 06:53:20.940
RuneScape is like either you got into or you didn't right. I think that's everyone. Hopefully question mark

06:53:21.740 --> 06:53:24.300
as we head banger way of victory

06:53:25.340 --> 06:53:29.980
I don't know about the other reefling that got stuck and sent us forward, but thank you for not holding us back

06:53:31.340 --> 06:53:35.420
But at the same time I feel bad because it's like the whole point of this is to the question and stuff together

06:53:35.500 --> 06:53:41.340
Right, let's get in the nicer parts of the channel the the evil at bay type of thing go away

06:53:42.620 --> 06:53:44.620
Wait, let me finish my tea

06:53:47.660 --> 06:53:53.020
Either you got into it and you're still playing this day or you didn't see I got into guild wars instead. I don't play killed

06:53:55.500 --> 06:53:57.500
Oh

06:54:03.740 --> 06:54:08.940
I thought it gave us feathers, but it didn't I was just an image of a feather because we need feathers to do fishing

06:54:13.580 --> 06:54:16.460
I was so into it and was so shy that in typing class

06:54:16.460 --> 06:54:20.460
I won't be glad as RuneScape rules and wait for someone to see it and ask me if I played

06:54:20.860 --> 06:54:22.860
Oh, that's such a shame

06:54:26.140 --> 06:54:28.540
Feathers we need feathers

06:54:29.660 --> 06:54:31.500
Birds of a feather

06:54:31.500 --> 06:54:35.100
Right, we're gonna take a left and go

06:54:36.460 --> 06:54:38.860
Oh wait, no, do we need to go to ports RM?

06:54:40.300 --> 06:54:44.140
I think we actually need to go at the fishing shop to buy our rod and feathers

06:54:45.020 --> 06:54:47.020
the fishing shops

06:54:47.500 --> 06:54:50.220
West and south so we'll go west and south

06:54:51.180 --> 06:54:56.620

07:10:00.240 --> 07:10:05.760
Let's just hope everything in here other than like all of these

07:10:06.720 --> 07:10:08.720
Keep that

07:10:09.280 --> 07:10:11.280
Wait, what if I don't go

07:10:11.680 --> 07:10:13.680
Oh, no, I'll have a better shield. That's why

07:10:14.400 --> 07:10:18.080
And then put that away and then put the fishing rod away and then put the money away

07:10:19.040 --> 07:10:21.040
I don't know. I didn't mean to click that. Okay

07:10:22.320 --> 07:10:24.800
Okay, we did it. We're ready to fish and cook

07:10:26.000 --> 07:10:28.000
Apparently everyone has a rod jeez

07:10:29.440 --> 07:10:31.440
It must do a rod

07:10:32.560 --> 07:10:34.560
A fishing rod

07:10:34.640 --> 07:10:39.440
It's my idea the strange old woman in the forest isn't full with so many strange requests

07:10:41.280 --> 07:10:45.120
Uh, I guess we're ready to take off if everyone's emptied their inventory

07:10:45.200 --> 07:10:49.760
And you should have a rod and feathers and then we are going to go fishing and level up our cooking eggs

07:10:49.840 --> 07:10:51.840
exponentially. Is everyone ready?

07:10:52.080 --> 07:10:55.200
All aboard the golden apron train

07:10:57.040 --> 07:11:01.760
I'll just make sure in case someone's stuck at the bank right now. It's kind of hard to tell because there's like so many

07:11:01.760 --> 07:11:03.760
Oh, no, there's only

07:11:03.920 --> 07:11:05.920
Rods out the way to everyone

07:11:06.000 --> 07:11:08.000
so few female

07:11:09.120 --> 07:11:11.520
And it is what it is

07:11:13.760 --> 07:11:16.960
Oh wishes to trade with you. Okay. What's up?

07:11:18.480 --> 07:11:21.760
Are you giving me your you give me your banana? Oh, yeah

07:11:24.640 --> 07:11:29.520
Wait, is this a thing? Well, no, it's not. Okay. I've just been given the

07:11:30.480 --> 07:11:36.880
Did you just finish be honest or ate it? I'm sorry. I just ate it right in front of you. I'm sorry. I just ate your banana

07:11:38.480 --> 07:11:40.480
Right, is that everyone?

07:11:42.000 --> 07:11:44.000
Uh

07:11:44.240 --> 07:11:50.160
Can I store it somewhere or just drop stuff off? Oh, yeah. So do you see over here how it says

07:11:50.720 --> 07:11:52.720
uh bank banker

07:11:54.160 --> 07:11:57.120
And then click on your inventory and it'll put it in the bank

07:11:57.440 --> 07:12:01.840
This empties out your inventory. The only thing you want right now is a fly fishing rod and feathers

07:12:02.640 --> 07:12:04.640
banana

07:12:05.920 --> 07:12:07.920
It's tweet all over again

07:12:08.240 --> 07:12:13.680
I actually had a lot of fun. Thank you. That's me. I don't know what it's I don't know if it's gotten more popular or not

07:12:14.400 --> 07:12:17.760
But when I woke up it was like 1000 likes and I'm like, oh

07:12:24.320 --> 07:12:26.320
Okay, that should hopefully be

07:12:27.680 --> 07:12:33.920
Uh, and then we'll take all the reeflings away. Actually we'll follow. Well, I don't know if all the reeflings are over here

07:12:35.600 --> 07:12:37.600
Think you got it

07:12:38.640 --> 07:12:44.320
She just ate that man's banana live on public on stream in public in front of everyone

07:12:46.880 --> 07:12:53.120
Okay, is that all reeflings? I'm like nine names. Oh, no one more one more. There's one more reefing

07:12:54.080 --> 07:12:57.200
Look at that fit look at the feet size

07:12:59.040 --> 07:13:01.040
Okay, we now follow

07:13:02.000 --> 07:13:06.160
The reeflings I thought was making a threat via the poison and fish fish

07:13:08.800 --> 07:13:10.800
That video was good

07:13:12.080 --> 07:13:16.800
Okay reeflings, we're going to barbarian village. Uh, hopefully there's no bots talking

07:13:16.880 --> 07:13:18.880
I'm probably just gonna click ignore

07:13:19.440 --> 07:13:24.000
If there's any bot so we don't have to world hop because this is a pretty quiet world in general

07:13:25.040 --> 07:13:27.040
Yeah, it was great. I lost that video

07:13:28.240 --> 07:13:30.240
Really

07:13:30.880 --> 07:13:33.360
I was like wondering should I like over compliment

07:13:33.920 --> 07:13:37.920
Over complicate it and like say like certain words phrase or whatever and I was like, no

07:13:38.160 --> 07:13:40.640
Just be super simple about it. So I was

07:13:40.640 --> 07:13:42.640
I

07:13:42.880 --> 07:13:44.880
Did it

07:13:45.600 --> 07:13:50.320
Right, okay. So this is barbarian fishing section

07:13:51.360 --> 07:13:55.920
It's normally bought it, but I don't know this may be real people

07:13:55.920 --> 07:14:01.520
This is the best like free to play area. We'll do here. We'll lure our fishing world

07:14:03.440 --> 07:14:06.720
And uh, how are you a cow? You were a bunny a second ago

07:14:07.520 --> 07:14:09.520
Oh

07:14:09.920 --> 07:14:13.760
I've already caught a fish. Whoa the fishing is so fast

07:14:16.240 --> 07:14:18.800
Oh my god, really gonna be leveling up so quickly

07:14:25.520 --> 07:14:29.520
Well, once whatever you catch there's a pair of my fire over here that we could cook

07:14:31.360 --> 07:14:35.840
Everyone did get level 20 fishing, right or I've just dragged you over here for nothing

07:14:37.680 --> 07:14:40.160
I hope everyone's uh

07:14:42.640 --> 07:14:44.640
Oh, you're all up to 20

07:14:48.640 --> 07:14:50.640
Uh

07:14:51.840 --> 07:14:54.800
Oh, no, I thought everyone was 20 fishing. I'm so sorry

07:14:57.280 --> 07:14:59.280
Oh, I'm not level 20. No

07:15:00.240 --> 07:15:02.240
No

07:15:02.640 --> 07:15:04.640
My suggestion

07:15:04.640 --> 07:15:11.760
If you're not level 20, you need to get that net and go back to the thing. I joined late. I'll level in tunes night later

07:15:13.760 --> 07:15:15.760
Not me, but I'll jump over and get it quick

07:15:17.520 --> 07:15:20.640
Oh, no, there's a banana on the floor random banana

07:15:21.360 --> 07:15:23.360
Oh

07:15:26.320 --> 07:15:28.320
So any that video in your altar is one of the whole

07:15:32.560 --> 07:15:34.800
How many leaks is that I'm allowed to know

07:15:36.400 --> 07:15:41.280
If you aren't level 20, I would suggest going

07:15:42.080 --> 07:15:47.360
Back to Lumbridge teleport to Lumbridge get your small fishing net out the bank at the top

07:15:47.680 --> 07:15:50.160
And then go back to that spot until you're 20

07:15:50.880 --> 07:15:52.880
And then coming here

07:15:53.360 --> 07:15:57.280
Well, I'm already level 21. Jesus so much faster doing this. It's crazy

07:15:59.040 --> 07:16:01.040
Is that 1.4?

07:16:02.400 --> 07:16:04.960
As long as people enjoyed it, that's the main thing

07:16:08.880 --> 07:16:15.040
What level to bait fish here, I'm not sure I only brought feathers for fly fish

07:16:18.080 --> 07:16:20.080
No comment

07:16:21.440 --> 07:16:23.440
Okay

07:16:25.040 --> 07:16:28.800
Should I do a burp at the end of one of them? Maybe I should they do like a burp version

07:16:35.280 --> 07:16:36.800
But yes

07:16:36.800 --> 07:16:40.240
If I we're probably gonna be here for like a hot second

07:16:41.040 --> 07:16:46.160
Uh mercy's going up in an hour 40. So honestly, I think for the rest of the stream

07:16:46.160 --> 07:16:50.400
We're gonna be here. So if you want to level up to 20 cooking you certainly can

07:16:51.360 --> 07:16:56.560
It's sorry 20 fishing and then like come back here. Like we'll probably most likely be here

07:16:59.680 --> 07:17:01.440
And

07:17:01.440 --> 07:17:07.760
Hopefully I can stop burning fish and then I can start burning through the supplies that were gifted because like I think I got like

07:17:08.160 --> 07:17:11.840
2000 fish gifted to me. I'll be back. Good luck. Yeah

07:17:12.480 --> 07:17:16.240
Have a good time. You can teleport via your magic spell

07:17:17.120 --> 07:17:18.800
Get on to

07:17:18.880 --> 07:17:20.320
Get to

07:17:20.320 --> 07:17:24.160
Lumberge again and do that small thing and then come back here once you've got your fly fishing rod

07:17:24.400 --> 07:17:26.400
And I've got loads of feathers on me

07:17:32.560 --> 07:17:38.960
Yeah, this is where the ground begins. We are currently at 25 cooking which is decent

07:17:39.440 --> 07:17:44.080
I wanted to get 40 before stream. I think 40 is part of that camera animation

07:17:44.480 --> 07:17:47.440
I think 40 is 40 realistic before

07:17:48.400 --> 07:17:50.400
The mercy goes live. I'm not sure

07:17:51.360 --> 07:17:56.080
I'm not sure bait fishing is 25. Oh, that's even worse. How do you get

07:17:56.880 --> 07:17:58.880
grapes actually

07:17:59.440 --> 07:18:03.120
From the grand exchange. I don't actually know where you harvest them

07:18:07.600 --> 07:18:09.600
Tea time

07:18:10.240 --> 07:18:15.920
We're actually going to get decent level in fishing. Yeah. Whoa, it's 58 peter fish. That's quite a lot

07:18:16.960 --> 07:18:18.960
All things considered

07:18:19.040 --> 07:18:23.200
I'm gonna level up in fishing again on this one stalk of enemy door

07:18:25.920 --> 07:18:27.920
Yeah

07:18:32.080 --> 07:18:36.400
Oh, that's a lot of trout on the floor. That's literally 10 key worth of fish

07:18:37.360 --> 07:18:39.040
13

07:18:39.040 --> 07:18:41.040
kxp per hour

07:18:41.760 --> 07:18:44.560
If you don't cook the fish, yeah, we're gonna have to stop and use this fire

07:18:44.560 --> 07:18:47.600
But this is a permanent fire that we can utilize for ourselves

07:18:48.720 --> 07:18:50.720
Which is fantastic

07:18:52.160 --> 07:18:58.880
Would it make sense to just buy them in bulk? Yeah, especially if you do that route and just buy 66. Oh, that would be daunting

07:19:00.560 --> 07:19:02.560
But it's definitely a possibility

07:19:06.400 --> 07:19:08.400
Hmm

07:19:09.280 --> 07:19:13.680
I'm wondering maybe we could do react andy content

07:19:16.160 --> 07:19:20.560
I don't know if there's like stuff that's safe for youtube reaction whilst we do this

07:19:21.200 --> 07:19:22.320
because

07:19:22.320 --> 07:19:28.000
Don't get me wrong. I'm entertaining, but I don't think I'm that entertaining for like a 30 hour grind

07:19:28.880 --> 07:19:30.880
If I was doing grapes

07:19:33.040 --> 07:19:35.040
Oh

07:19:36.000 --> 07:19:38.000
So maybe

07:19:39.280 --> 07:19:41.280
We put stuff on in the background

07:19:43.600 --> 07:19:47.760
78 p for cooking trout. Whoa

07:19:50.800 --> 07:19:54.960
That's so fast we're literally 26 already

07:19:56.800 --> 07:19:58.800
That is so fast

07:19:59.360 --> 07:20:03.840
We need mancraft parkour subway surfers and the bomb in the stream on play

07:20:05.760 --> 07:20:11.760
70 is so much when we unlock salmon. I don't even know how much fun it is

07:20:14.640 --> 07:20:16.640
I'll stop burning it stop burning it

07:20:30.160 --> 07:20:32.660
Just put some surf in the corner

07:20:35.840 --> 07:20:37.440
Okay

07:20:37.440 --> 07:20:41.600
Yeah, so this is like free grinding as well if you pick up this fish that people drop

07:20:43.600 --> 07:20:48.880
Oh, they literally went on two cooking levels doing one batch of fish. That's crazy

07:20:51.600 --> 07:20:53.600
I'm so fast

07:20:53.760 --> 07:20:55.760
Right, let's leave people alone

07:20:56.720 --> 07:20:58.720
Here fishy fishy

07:20:58.800 --> 07:21:03.520
We need to be quiet. We're just gonna get to the molly salmon or 90 cooking eggs. Okay. That will

07:21:04.480 --> 07:21:10.160
I'll listen to you. Yeah, whenever, but I've lost my mind entirely see tomorrow rest well, please rest well

07:21:11.680 --> 07:21:17.440
Gotta get up tomorrow. We can oh fun time. Oh my god. It's rinse scape in real life

07:21:20.080 --> 07:21:25.440
I'm trying to get easily watched. There's been nothing by yapping. It's because of my voice. It's so swan

07:21:26.640 --> 07:21:30.960
My faceman no dragon harpoon specking on free world. Oh

07:21:33.520 --> 07:21:35.520
Oh

07:21:39.520 --> 07:21:41.520
Wow

07:21:42.080 --> 07:21:44.080
I haven't seen it

07:21:45.040 --> 07:21:51.280
Honestly, we I thought we were gonna do 40 before mercy comes on but if we managed to like fish

07:21:52.320 --> 07:21:54.160
to high heaven

07:21:54.160 --> 07:21:57.360
We might be past 40. I don't know. I don't want to jinx it but

07:21:58.320 --> 07:22:01.840
40 on the first runescape stream seems pretty decent work

07:22:02.000 --> 07:22:04.000
And we also did fun questing

07:22:07.440 --> 07:22:10.240
We got how many first one two

07:22:11.760 --> 07:22:13.760
We're so fast one two

07:22:14.560 --> 07:22:16.560
three four five

07:22:17.360 --> 07:22:20.000
Six and seven well, maybe do

07:22:23.280 --> 07:22:25.280
23

07:22:25.680 --> 07:22:29.200
Got overtime tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to so have plenty of listening time

07:22:29.200 --> 07:22:31.200
I mean

07:22:31.600 --> 07:22:35.600
For anyone that needs to go to sleep or you need to go do some things

07:22:35.680 --> 07:22:40.960
Please do not worry. You're not missing out on much. This is literally the gameplay for the next uh hour and a half

07:22:41.040 --> 07:22:43.040
I'm not even kidding

07:22:43.120 --> 07:22:45.120
We're just fishing and then uh

07:22:45.360 --> 07:22:50.320
We're catching the fish and then cooking them and then leveling up cooking. This is literally squirting me right now

07:22:50.480 --> 07:22:51.840
Brian

07:22:51.840 --> 07:22:54.960
Hey, how strong are you back from work and jumping back on

07:22:55.280 --> 07:22:56.320
Where are you at?

07:22:56.320 --> 07:22:58.000
Hi tiny spinny

07:22:58.000 --> 07:23:02.640
Hope you had fun at work. We are currently in world 3a

07:23:03.520 --> 07:23:09.360
And we are in barbarian village. We're fishing so the grand exchange

07:23:10.000 --> 07:23:13.280
Varrock teleport and we're at the fishing village

07:23:13.680 --> 07:23:20.720
We have a fly fishing rod and we have a feather and we're catching the fish and cooking them on the perma

07:23:21.200 --> 07:23:22.800
a

07:23:22.800 --> 07:23:24.000
cookie thing

07:23:24.080 --> 07:23:27.200
Um once I'm experienced enough not to burn fish

07:23:27.360 --> 07:23:32.800
I most likely will cook all the fish that the reeflings gave me because I don't want them to go to waste

07:23:33.520 --> 07:23:37.520
Um because that was a lot of money that the reeflings handed me. Um

07:23:38.960 --> 07:23:40.480
I don't

07:23:40.480 --> 07:23:43.600
I'll cook all of that and see where we are. I think lobsters

07:23:44.480 --> 07:23:46.480
I got quite a few lobsters

07:23:46.880 --> 07:23:49.440
trout, salmon, all of that. So we're gonna cook all of that

07:23:49.920 --> 07:23:55.440
I don't think we're gonna be on wanes by the time mercy comes on

07:23:56.800 --> 07:23:58.800
Um

07:23:59.040 --> 07:24:01.040
I think tomorrow's my eighth morris stream

07:24:02.400 --> 07:24:05.920
So I definitely try and rest my voice so that's gonna be so strong

07:24:07.520 --> 07:24:11.040
I'm ready for another 2am yap session. We're listening to the Scottish last

07:24:12.560 --> 07:24:16.560
I've got plenty of yapping. We're like oh someone's got a mini

07:24:17.520 --> 07:24:19.520
mini quest a two jump

07:24:20.160 --> 07:24:22.160
Hot to free power hot to free power

07:24:29.600 --> 07:24:33.280
Such a tense gameplay. Oh my god. It's so intense. Wait. I'm not even fishing anyone

07:24:34.000 --> 07:24:38.160
That's probably the only thing that kills me about this game like when it comes to fishing and stuff

07:24:39.040 --> 07:24:41.040
It's when the boxes move

07:24:42.560 --> 07:24:45.360
But it is very tense into um

07:24:46.800 --> 07:24:50.640
Like pick up all the fish that are already here and just do that and spawn that

07:24:51.360 --> 07:24:54.880
Lobster requires 40 cooking so might be a way. I don't want to burn them

07:24:56.160 --> 07:24:58.160
Here we are going to 4am. I'm ready

07:25:00.320 --> 07:25:09.280
Yes, so if you want to join in some say hi world 380 um barbarian village fishing spot free to play free to play

07:25:10.000 --> 07:25:12.000
a little cheeky free to play um

07:25:12.960 --> 07:25:15.200
If I get the runescape

07:25:16.160 --> 07:25:19.200
Um, if I do end up getting the cooking cape

07:25:19.760 --> 07:25:20.960
We might take a break

07:25:20.960 --> 07:25:25.440
But I wouldn't mind doing membership quest at some point because I've never actually done them

07:25:25.440 --> 07:25:28.800
And I'm too scared to do them on my own, but if you guys are with me, I'm not scared

07:25:31.360 --> 07:25:36.320
Yes, I think tomorrow's ASMR stream and then day after is trying sweet

07:25:37.760 --> 07:25:43.200
And then after is Skyrim and I get to rant. No not rant. Sorry. I get to um

07:25:43.920 --> 07:25:45.920
Mumble away about Skyrim for ages

07:25:47.120 --> 07:25:51.760
Lobsters have a 60% chance to burn at level 40. Yeah, I'm not wasting lobsters. They are

07:25:53.360 --> 07:25:55.360
That is rough

07:25:55.360 --> 07:25:56.960
That's rough

07:25:56.960 --> 07:26:00.320
I don't want to waste a lot. Wait, because that was so much fish I got given

07:26:00.880 --> 07:26:03.520
God, we're like leveling up our fishing so easily

07:26:06.480 --> 07:26:10.800
Right, we are full. Let's see. Can we get two levels out of this if we don't burn them?

07:26:11.360 --> 07:26:13.360
It burns for the first one

07:26:15.760 --> 07:26:19.280
Dude, waterfall fires, it gets you to combat level 30. What?

07:26:20.560 --> 07:26:21.920
Really?

07:26:21.920 --> 07:26:24.960
I know I got some quests really give you a lot of XP, but

07:26:26.160 --> 07:26:30.320
Can't wait for days more, but I'm lucky for the time. Maybe I'll pass a bit later. Hmm

07:26:31.760 --> 07:26:33.760
Um

07:26:33.840 --> 07:26:37.600
Don't worry if you can't make it to any stream like I think the boss will stay up and

07:26:38.560 --> 07:26:42.800
I'm not going to be doing ear licking because something weird is going on with YouTube

07:26:43.760 --> 07:26:48.800
It's going on a little weird with YouTube and I don't know what's going on. So I'm not risking it

07:26:52.720 --> 07:26:55.280
As I gave you all those lobsters you can burn them if you need to

07:26:57.680 --> 07:27:04.240
I'd rather not like waste the XP like if it was potential full XP like it's okay to burn these trout for example

07:27:04.240 --> 07:27:06.240
Oh

07:27:06.480 --> 07:27:12.000
Oh, come on one more and I'll level up. Okay. There we go 20. Oh, yeah

07:27:13.760 --> 07:27:17.440
I want 40 before mercy comes online. We're under the clock refunds

07:27:18.560 --> 07:27:20.560
But under the clock

07:27:20.640 --> 07:27:24.880
Empty inventory. Let's get it ish get it. I don't know if I should fish or if I should honestly

07:27:26.160 --> 07:27:27.680
Just put my stuff away and pick up

07:27:27.680 --> 07:27:32.480
But if everyone was picking up what was put on the floor then we wouldn't have enough trout to go around

07:27:35.200 --> 07:27:37.200
Mmm

07:27:38.880 --> 07:27:42.560
Where would be the first day smart? Hopefully YouTube will get off

07:27:44.720 --> 07:27:51.200
No, it's like cracking down everywhere on anime smart in particular if you want to call it anime smart

07:27:54.160 --> 07:27:58.880
It'll be faster to loot the fish if you just want to do a cooking. That's what I'm thinking

07:28:01.040 --> 07:28:03.040
If I just do that instead

07:28:03.760 --> 07:28:05.760
Mmm

07:28:07.120 --> 07:28:12.320
It's nice to get the level of XP, but I feel I'm gonna like blast ahead of you refunds if I do that

07:28:12.320 --> 07:28:14.320
Would you guys be upset if I picked up trout?

07:28:16.080 --> 07:28:18.080
Hopefully not

07:28:18.320 --> 07:28:21.920
It would blast me forward though like compared to everyone's level

07:28:27.600 --> 07:28:29.600
Go for it

07:28:30.560 --> 07:28:31.760
Ah

07:28:31.760 --> 07:28:37.360
What do I need I just need trout. I can't cook salmon because I'm too low level wait examine

07:28:39.280 --> 07:28:43.360
No, I don't want salmon. I can't cook it. I want trout

07:28:44.960 --> 07:28:49.840
Right, we'll see how far this gets me ahead if I do this method where I don't fish

07:28:50.320 --> 07:28:54.080
Maybe you guys can drop the fish for me and we get fish train going

07:28:54.800 --> 07:28:56.800
It's two more

07:28:56.960 --> 07:28:58.960
Right, let's cook this batch

07:29:00.320 --> 07:29:02.160
I like fish

07:29:02.160 --> 07:29:04.160
The fish are so amazing

07:29:06.720 --> 07:29:10.400
Basically, if you can't see what they're actually doing there are a few minutes. Yes

07:29:10.720 --> 07:29:15.840
I think that's what the problem is why in real life is fine, but anime's getting swapped with it

07:29:17.520 --> 07:29:20.480
I say anime beach over animation. You know what me

07:29:21.920 --> 07:29:23.920
Anyway, I start blasting

07:29:25.360 --> 07:29:27.360
We're fish slaves let's go

07:29:28.160 --> 07:29:30.160
Sounds a bit fishy, but okay

07:29:37.280 --> 07:29:39.280
Are we gonna make it I think we are

07:29:41.200 --> 07:29:43.200
I said

07:29:44.400 --> 07:29:46.400
No idea when I said oh

07:29:48.640 --> 07:29:51.360
29 already. Oh my god, this is so fast

07:29:51.760 --> 07:29:56.800
I'm I'm saying it's fast now because it's going to be so slow later, but like I'm happy

07:29:57.600 --> 07:30:00.240
I like only burnt four from that batch as well

07:30:01.280 --> 07:30:04.080
That trout is getting cooked to perfection by me

07:30:06.240 --> 07:30:08.240
I see trout I see trout

07:30:12.400 --> 07:30:14.400
I don't know. There's a cooked trout

07:30:14.640 --> 07:30:18.720
Right, I'm gonna have to fish you go fish. Oh wait, someone wants to trade with me. Hold on

07:30:22.240 --> 07:30:25.760
Oh, you'll never guess what it's true

07:30:27.440 --> 07:30:29.440
He he he

07:30:29.520 --> 07:30:36.320
Oh, no, you cancelled. Oh, you don't have enough incidentary space. Oh, no, sorry. I don't know how many I've got left like

07:30:37.760 --> 07:30:40.240
Space room freaking yeah

07:30:43.360 --> 07:30:49.440
Trade modified blink blink blink. It's so serious. I don't know if that's too much. Oh, no

07:30:49.840 --> 07:30:55.200
Is it? Oh, you filled me. Oh my inventory you filled my inventory. Thank you beef life

07:31:01.280 --> 07:31:04.080
I'm terrible, but thank you very much. We've flown

07:31:05.200 --> 07:31:11.200
It's running out here playing cooking mummy. Literally. I'm feeding you don't get 100 success on trout until 49

07:31:11.920 --> 07:31:14.640
That's so rough. I don't remember it being so like that

07:31:19.440 --> 07:31:21.440
Mmm

07:31:26.720 --> 07:31:28.720
We're already gonna level up again

07:31:30.800 --> 07:31:33.840
I don't know when we unlock being able to cook salmon, but it's gonna be soon

07:31:33.920 --> 07:31:36.800
We're gonna drop all the trout in the south spot of salmon here. Yeah

07:31:38.320 --> 07:31:41.280
If you don't overlap on the salmon, it makes it so easy to pick up

07:31:42.240 --> 07:31:44.240
Wow

07:31:44.560 --> 07:31:46.960
Are we gonna be 50 by the time mercy?

07:31:46.960 --> 07:31:48.960
I

07:31:49.200 --> 07:31:51.200
We may honestly

07:31:54.320 --> 07:31:57.040
I'm I'm cooking by gas. I'm cooking the best I can

07:31:58.240 --> 07:32:01.840
Okay, we had like way more burnt in that batch. So it really is just randomized

07:32:02.720 --> 07:32:06.720
Let's empty our inventory and then let's grab all these troops

07:32:06.720 --> 07:32:08.720
Oh

07:32:14.480 --> 07:32:16.960
Over there Hayden. Oh wait, sorry

07:32:18.880 --> 07:32:24.720
Uh, I don't know if you have to take into I can't how much like inventory space I'll have

07:32:27.920 --> 07:32:32.180
Okay, yeah as long as you put whatever inventory

07:32:37.600 --> 07:32:40.640
Oh my god

07:32:42.320 --> 07:32:44.320
Love's recessing

07:32:45.840 --> 07:32:51.040
The key to power leveling is slave teamwork. Honestly, we're doing pretty good

07:32:52.640 --> 07:32:55.200
We're already launching the 30s

07:32:57.840 --> 07:32:59.840
I think we can fly past the 40s

07:33:00.000 --> 07:33:01.520
honestly

07:33:01.520 --> 07:33:03.840
I strongly have been away from what's the how's it going?

07:33:04.880 --> 07:33:09.680
We have done some quests some free to play quests. We are currently at

07:33:10.560 --> 07:33:12.400
barbarian village

07:33:12.400 --> 07:33:15.120
And I'm currently using the reef wings

07:33:15.840 --> 07:33:22.880
Um to slave fish for me. So we're getting trout and I'm currently like leveling up like crazy right now

07:33:24.560 --> 07:33:28.880
Every batch of trout is making me go up another level. I'm already 31 cooking

07:33:29.840 --> 07:33:34.240
We, um, we're messing around having fun on quest

07:33:35.120 --> 07:33:39.120
Uh, and now I'm just doing I'm actually tempted to go to the grand exchange to

07:33:39.360 --> 07:33:41.360
Oh, sorry, I'm pressing the wrong button. Um

07:33:42.080 --> 07:33:49.600
I'm tempted to go to the grand exchange to drop the feathers and the fishing rod off just to do like full inventories as well

07:33:50.320 --> 07:33:56.080
I think I may I'm going to be right back reef wings. Okay. I'm going to drop the feathers and the fishing rod away

07:33:57.040 --> 07:34:00.880
That you guys can stay don't worry. Don't get separation anxiety. I'll be right back

07:34:00.960 --> 07:34:04.800
I'm mommy's going to the grand exchange and back again. You'll be okay

07:34:05.680 --> 07:34:07.520
It's fine

07:34:07.520 --> 07:34:11.200
Mommy will be right back. See I'm cross the water. Bye. Bye. I'll be right back

07:34:14.320 --> 07:34:15.680
Literally

07:34:15.680 --> 07:34:19.760
All right, I just need to drop this off so I can have feel no, I'm not the book

07:34:20.160 --> 07:34:23.280
I'm not the birth. I want the bank. I'm trying to see if I can do it through the ceiling

07:34:24.240 --> 07:34:26.240
I can't

07:34:27.120 --> 07:34:30.960
She's never coming back. I'm coming back. I just need to bank the banker

07:34:32.720 --> 07:34:38.160
There there there. See look empty. Look. I'm already running back. I'm running out of stamina. It's okay. I'm a wee bit tired

07:34:38.240 --> 07:34:40.240
I'm getting a wee bit tired 45

07:34:40.480 --> 07:34:42.480
stamina

07:34:43.040 --> 07:34:45.040
Oh

07:34:45.040 --> 07:34:47.040
I'm coming back. I'm coming back

07:34:47.760 --> 07:34:49.760
We're orphans. No

07:34:50.720 --> 07:34:55.120
It can't be you can't be you can't be so look look look I'm back. Look who's that? Who's that?

07:34:55.200 --> 07:34:57.200
That's right. I'm on the other side of the water. Boom

07:34:58.000 --> 07:35:03.280
I'm coming to pick up that trout that's on the floor there because there's tons of the renaissance of the fire as well

07:35:06.080 --> 07:35:09.200
See we have no home see like I'm literally right here

07:35:10.720 --> 07:35:14.480
Is there so dramatic? See if all the trout

07:35:15.840 --> 07:35:18.080
I'm max a leveling up

07:35:19.040 --> 07:35:21.040
I'm going to pick up all the ones on the floor

07:35:21.760 --> 07:35:25.840
It's better to drop the trout. It's faster to drop it. Um

07:35:26.960 --> 07:35:32.320
Who it's who dares the spots picking up? It's faster to drop the trout than it is to trade me

07:35:32.880 --> 07:35:34.880
Right. Okay. Full inventory

07:35:37.360 --> 07:35:41.200
We're going to be in the 50s after this. There's no way we're not

07:35:44.320 --> 07:35:46.320
What were you doing with all those people in the business?

07:35:48.080 --> 07:35:50.080
Dropping trout

07:35:50.880 --> 07:35:52.880
Trout oh

07:35:52.960 --> 07:35:54.960
Oh, pardon me trout

07:35:55.920 --> 07:35:57.600
trout

07:35:57.600 --> 07:35:59.600
The fish trout

07:36:00.560 --> 07:36:01.600
trout

07:36:01.600 --> 07:36:04.000
You don't need to see the tea at the drop

07:36:05.920 --> 07:36:07.920
There's loads of words that fail like that

07:36:08.800 --> 07:36:10.800
Can't believe it

07:36:11.440 --> 07:36:13.440
Check your xp per hour on the bar

07:36:15.280 --> 07:36:17.280
Uh

07:36:17.600 --> 07:36:19.600
Why is it not displaying?

07:36:20.880 --> 07:36:26.240
Those i'm cooking cooked 92 93 per hour burn 23 burn rate

07:36:27.360 --> 07:36:29.360
Why is it not displaying?

07:36:29.520 --> 07:36:31.520
Cooking though

07:36:32.240 --> 07:36:36.880
It's not like telling me literally level 20. It's not like telling me. Why is it weird?

07:36:39.920 --> 07:36:41.920
Hmm

07:36:43.600 --> 07:36:45.680
Okay, it's short for trousers

07:36:48.240 --> 07:36:54.720
Uh, oh this one. Oh now we're talking hold on let me drop all these

07:36:57.040 --> 07:37:03.200
It says for not fishing cooking. Where is cooking? Where's cooking?

07:37:05.360 --> 07:37:08.320
Here cooking is purple. Why would it be purple honestly?

07:37:09.920 --> 07:37:12.800
All right, let me grab the all these trout. There's like so much on the floor honestly

07:37:12.800 --> 07:37:14.800
I

07:37:15.440 --> 07:37:17.440
Can't keep up there's so much

07:37:20.160 --> 07:37:25.440
It says I'm gaining 2000 xp per hour

07:37:27.360 --> 07:37:32.160
Oh, there's trout trout trout trout no the trout not the fire

07:37:33.520 --> 07:37:35.520
Now I've got a fill inventory

07:37:36.800 --> 07:37:38.800
Wow, all right, let's see

07:37:39.520 --> 07:37:45.200
xp gained 16 hour roughly 2k but it's probably going to go up for a bit because I'm not being doing fill trout and

07:37:46.080 --> 07:37:48.080
xp left

07:37:48.080 --> 07:37:50.960
Oh, no, it's getting covered up by the freaking layer

07:37:55.840 --> 07:38:01.520
I'm coming back in we're at barbarian village at the free play fishing spot

07:38:03.760 --> 07:38:06.800
But I think we're definitely higher. Yeah, this is going up

07:38:06.800 --> 07:38:10.560
It says we're now 2.3 per hour because we've not done it for an hour but

07:38:12.080 --> 07:38:15.520
Once we have it says actually I don't even see that

07:38:16.960 --> 07:38:22.080
Of course not it says like it literally says like six actions left and then we've leveled up so

07:38:22.720 --> 07:38:28.960
That's really good. I like that and kind of puts into perspective like how much you need to do in order to get next

07:38:29.760 --> 07:38:39.840
You can write literally level 33 you can reset

07:38:44.800 --> 07:38:47.440
That's the only burnt to all burnt three that time

07:38:52.000 --> 07:38:56.240
They don't look burn three that time. I'm so MLG pro

07:38:59.600 --> 07:39:02.000
Well, I shouldn't maybe drop the

07:39:07.280 --> 07:39:10.160
I don't know when I can start cooking salmon, but it should be sent to him

07:39:15.680 --> 07:39:19.040
She needs that raw fish meat. Are you treating me fish?

07:39:21.120 --> 07:39:22.240
Oh

07:39:22.240 --> 07:39:26.320
Oh, no, I don't have inventory for that. Is that tuna? I'm pretty sure that's tuna

07:39:26.720 --> 07:39:33.200
Sorry, I don't have any. Oh, you're giving me three tuna. I don't even think I'm like leveling enough to do that

07:39:34.000 --> 07:39:36.640
What are you use tuna on the fire?

07:39:37.440 --> 07:39:40.800
Oh, I can oh, it's not channel. What is it is channel?

07:39:41.600 --> 07:39:43.600
Oh burnt it

07:39:44.320 --> 07:39:47.840
It's 100 xp. Wait, that's more xp than salmon

07:39:51.600 --> 07:39:53.600
Okay

07:39:54.320 --> 07:39:57.520
Reset it seems to have bugged out. Okay, I'll reset it. Sorry

07:40:00.560 --> 07:40:02.800
Oh, I know it's not the bomb. Oh, you can actually see it though

07:40:05.360 --> 07:40:11.440
Tuna max and right now man's running. I just realized that you and my definition of fun are completely different

07:40:12.160 --> 07:40:17.440
I mean, I'm literally becoming a little chef. I'm able to feed all the reeflings like this now

07:40:18.400 --> 07:40:20.400
I

07:40:20.960 --> 07:40:28.080
Be getting all the things. Oh, this is have nine actions left. That's so cool that it says like you literally have a number

07:40:28.960 --> 07:40:33.360
Because soon it will be like a hundred left and then I'll be a thousand left now. But like that's fine

07:40:34.960 --> 07:40:36.960
Her numbers are going way up

07:40:37.280 --> 07:40:42.480
Literally, this is like if you like slow and incremental games that feel satisfying

07:40:43.120 --> 07:40:45.120
Runescape is definitely for you

07:40:45.280 --> 07:40:46.400
Yeah

07:40:46.400 --> 07:40:48.400
I've never 99 something

07:40:49.040 --> 07:40:53.040
And I want to do it and you guys can hold me accountable for it

07:40:54.320 --> 07:41:00.160
I'll let you tuna max. I'm sorry. Who's got trout for me. No, that's cooked trout. That's raw trout. Okay. Oh wait

07:41:00.320 --> 07:41:04.400
Is this except ready? You got more tuna. It's the tuna man

07:41:06.240 --> 07:41:09.440
Of course, it's fun numbers goes up dopamine. We all get literally

07:41:10.800 --> 07:41:13.120
Wow, thank you so much for the tuna

07:41:13.120 --> 07:41:14.400
Oh

07:41:14.400 --> 07:41:16.400
How is everyone today someone asks?

07:41:18.560 --> 07:41:24.560
We're uh, we're tuna max. Uh, no, not sure. Oh, oh, I was talking

07:41:25.680 --> 07:41:27.680
Are you squidding me right now, Brian?

07:41:28.640 --> 07:41:32.080
We love when number go up. So have some number. Oh

07:41:33.520 --> 07:41:37.360
Money's different. Thank you for the tip. Don't stay down

07:41:38.560 --> 07:41:42.000
We do love money going up and incremental video games

07:41:44.080 --> 07:41:48.320
We're playing cooking sim and it's amazing

07:41:49.120 --> 07:41:50.560
hope

07:41:50.560 --> 07:41:56.400
Hope your day is going well smiley facie. We always be nice to people

07:41:58.400 --> 07:42:04.000
I am burning the absolute living daylights out of this tuna. I'm so sorry. I've just wasted all that tuna

07:42:06.720 --> 07:42:08.720
So sorry

07:42:09.680 --> 07:42:11.680
I have been here for like four hours

07:42:13.840 --> 07:42:18.960
Oh, I keep messing it up. I wonder if you could sell kuchina for decent money. I don't think it's a cheap fish

07:42:20.480 --> 07:42:23.360
I seem to think like all right raw trout time

07:42:26.240 --> 07:42:29.440
Uh fishing levels, uh, um

07:42:33.680 --> 07:42:38.080
What the fuck runes get message saying I'm going to be logged in 30 minutes max six hours play. Wait, is that real?

07:42:39.360 --> 07:42:42.080
Wait, you got more tuna already. Wait, you can't have

07:42:43.280 --> 07:42:45.280
I

07:42:45.600 --> 07:42:47.600
How are you doing?

07:42:47.840 --> 07:42:52.880
Are you peddling tuna to me to level me up faster? I feel like I'm wasting all your tuna

07:42:55.520 --> 07:42:57.520
Oh, no

07:42:57.760 --> 07:43:02.720
Wait, are we finally doing it? Are we are we got tuna slave runners?

07:43:05.360 --> 07:43:07.360
Yes, like there was log is real

07:43:07.440 --> 07:43:11.440
Wait, am I gonna be booted out or because I bought membership? I'm not gonna be booted out

07:43:12.240 --> 07:43:14.720
I have plenty of tuna. I could literally buy a million

07:43:17.840 --> 07:43:25.200
Hey, scrawny, am I in trouble for cooking my own food tonight? Does that mean I could just jump into the kitchen? You're allowed to make it

07:43:27.520 --> 07:43:33.520
He that is messed up. I'm not a child literally why is the game doing it for a bandwidth issues

07:43:34.160 --> 07:43:36.800
If you're a free member, they're like, oh, we've had enough of you

07:43:37.760 --> 07:43:44.320
Strawny becomes a master chef, but can't fight a rat. No, it was the cow that was going to kill me. It was a baby cow

07:43:46.800 --> 07:43:48.800
And you just log in right back after

07:43:50.240 --> 07:43:52.880
That's bizarre. No, I mean, what?

07:43:54.320 --> 07:44:00.880
Well, it says we've been up for seven hours or is it because I got logged out when I went away for like a cup of tea in that

07:44:01.440 --> 07:44:03.440
I wonder if that's why

07:44:04.320 --> 07:44:05.840
Hold on

07:44:05.840 --> 07:44:08.480
Is tuna max is tuna max were there?

07:44:10.720 --> 07:44:15.280
I've got booted out at one point. Yeah, you've just been dc in a lot. Okay. Every time I go for tinkle winkle

07:44:15.600 --> 07:44:17.600
I've been dc'd so it doesn't count

07:44:18.480 --> 07:44:24.800
How much do you care about doing the proper way? Um, I think I'm supposed to do wine next someone says hi, emmy

07:44:25.360 --> 07:44:27.360
Is the emmy imposter here

07:44:28.240 --> 07:44:30.240
Where's the emmy imposter?

07:44:33.840 --> 07:44:35.440
Oh, there it is

07:44:35.440 --> 07:44:41.760
You changed your name to emmy visa and game level 113. That's a big account. Honestly

07:44:43.200 --> 07:44:45.200
Okay, let me grab this

07:44:47.680 --> 07:44:50.640
Emmys emmy's a RuneScape nerd

07:44:52.640 --> 07:44:58.560
No, it's not the real embers, but someone likes her so I'm glad someone enjoys her as much to do that

07:44:59.520 --> 07:45:06.640
Emmy the goat honestly, what's the fit on emmy? Oh, they changed her hair to look like her pumpkins and everything

07:45:07.360 --> 07:45:10.400
Give her a skirt. That's supposed to be her blue shorts

07:45:11.280 --> 07:45:13.280
Okay, okay

07:45:15.680 --> 07:45:17.680
Where is that

07:45:17.920 --> 07:45:25.520
We're already level 35. Oh, we should have came here like from the beginning. We didn't even have had to do anything

07:45:26.480 --> 07:45:30.240
Yeah, and that baby cow has been caught for a cake

07:45:33.120 --> 07:45:35.920
Hydration check I'm actually running out of water

07:45:40.080 --> 07:45:42.080
What's mercy one hour

07:45:47.440 --> 07:45:49.200
Wow

07:45:49.200 --> 07:45:54.240
It gives me like relief drinking water for a millisecond and then I feel the pain of talking again

07:45:55.760 --> 07:45:57.760
Let's breathe this raw trip

07:45:58.880 --> 07:46:00.720
Raw trip

07:46:00.720 --> 07:46:04.080
Oh, sorry, I keep forgetting mr. Tuna man. I apologize

07:46:05.360 --> 07:46:07.600
I got like three three space

07:46:10.880 --> 07:46:14.800
That tuna man going ham oh my god, that's so much money

07:46:15.760 --> 07:46:21.440
Absolutely nothing and then the value on your side is just like losing horrifically

07:46:22.160 --> 07:46:24.160
You

07:46:25.760 --> 07:46:31.040
I can do one more inventory and then I have to do some room craft from from my clan skull the week. Okay. Thank you so much

07:46:31.920 --> 07:46:37.920
Excuse me, man. We had to level up to 20 fish and to start fishing here. Yes. You have to go back to

07:46:38.880 --> 07:46:42.160
Uh, the castello. Good luck. Thank you so much for the

07:46:43.200 --> 07:46:47.680
Thanks for all the fish. I'm pretty sure that is the ending to a movie

07:46:48.240 --> 07:46:50.640
That bill bull was in that haven't watched yet

07:46:52.080 --> 07:46:54.880
Um, I can't remember big ones. Thanks for all the fish

07:46:56.480 --> 07:47:02.720
Level 36. Oh my god, tuna literally a hundred a pop as well is crazy

07:47:05.200 --> 07:47:08.800
Keeps in the bunny suit girl turn into a guy on a remain

07:47:11.040 --> 07:47:12.480
It's because they're

07:47:12.480 --> 07:47:15.440
Dancing on each other hitchhikers guys. Yes. I've not seen that

07:47:16.400 --> 07:47:21.600
Good lord. You're so live. Yeah, we're tuna max and we're currently level 36

07:47:22.480 --> 07:47:24.720
And cooking it's that purple one right there

07:47:25.600 --> 07:47:27.120
here

07:47:27.120 --> 07:47:34.400
We're level 36 apparently your xp per hour is like freaking 56k with the tuna. It's like going off like crazy

07:47:41.520 --> 07:47:43.520
So much tuna

07:47:44.320 --> 07:47:46.640
You know, it's really nice tuna cucumber meal

07:47:48.960 --> 07:47:52.400
Like uncrusted bread. Oh, no, that's delicious

07:48:00.080 --> 07:48:04.400
Can we cook for all salmon yet? Let me check use the salmon on the fire

07:48:05.600 --> 07:48:11.680
With everyone's opinion on anchovy pizza. Oh, I can cook salmon. Okay. I can pick up salmon now as well

07:48:11.840 --> 07:48:14.400
Right, I'll pick up salmon and trout so I can just like do it all

07:48:15.840 --> 07:48:18.560
Level 50 is about 100 k xp total

07:48:21.040 --> 07:48:23.040
Oh, it's my total xp

07:48:24.720 --> 07:48:30.000
I am one fourth of the way to level 50. I'm not sure I can do it before mercy goes online

07:48:31.200 --> 07:48:33.200
Oh, I'll be cutting it close. I think

07:48:34.000 --> 07:48:38.560
Oh, no, I can I would have to be tuna maxing unless the salmon does it. I'm not sure

07:48:39.520 --> 07:48:41.520
Unless the salmon does it

07:48:44.640 --> 07:48:46.640
And if I stop burning everything

07:48:49.280 --> 07:48:51.280
I'm scooping up all this truth

07:48:54.480 --> 07:48:56.960
I'm scooping it up my inventory's getting so full

07:49:00.480 --> 07:49:02.480
Someone's got a mini cliff

07:49:02.960 --> 07:49:04.960
No, but that is huge

07:49:05.200 --> 07:49:07.200
Hey

07:49:08.160 --> 07:49:10.480
It's so fast with the salmon as well

07:49:12.560 --> 07:49:15.600
Oh five more salmon and then level up again

07:49:17.520 --> 07:49:19.520
Oh, come on. You can do it

07:49:20.960 --> 07:49:22.960
Two more one more

07:49:24.480 --> 07:49:25.840
Yes

07:49:25.840 --> 07:49:27.840
30 freaking six

07:49:28.000 --> 07:49:30.400
Hey 37. Sorry. I know numbers sometimes

07:49:31.680 --> 07:49:33.360
Oh

07:49:33.360 --> 07:49:36.720
We are tuna maxing. We are fish maxing out the wazoo right now

07:49:39.200 --> 07:49:41.280
Johnny you can do this Johnny

07:49:41.840 --> 07:49:44.960
Cook this scale as they start to like there's neither motor

07:49:47.120 --> 07:49:49.120
We're gonna do it. We're gonna do it

07:49:51.120 --> 07:49:56.400
A tuna is more xp than salmon. Salmon's more xp than trout

07:49:57.520 --> 07:50:02.960
But I'm fortunately I'm still at the burning stage. So I'm not like maximizing my inventory right now

07:50:04.080 --> 07:50:05.360
I

07:50:05.360 --> 07:50:12.400
Can't I don't think there's any other quests that give cooking xp that I know of other than there's probably a ton of members quests

07:50:12.640 --> 07:50:14.800
That do have like cooking xp

07:50:15.680 --> 07:50:16.960
um

07:50:16.960 --> 07:50:19.360
But as it stands right now

07:50:20.720 --> 07:50:22.720
We'll do full inventory roster

07:50:24.800 --> 07:50:30.320
But once we start once we stop burning then we can do like max inventory

07:50:31.120 --> 07:50:33.120
xp gains, which is really

07:50:33.760 --> 07:50:35.760
handy-dandy

07:50:35.760 --> 07:50:39.440
It took me a little bit of salmon. It's taking my troop. You need my troop

07:50:41.840 --> 07:50:46.080
Salmon might honestly be better rates when you factor in the burn rate. Mmm

07:50:47.200 --> 07:50:49.200
It's possible

07:50:49.360 --> 07:50:55.920
Someone else here is like syncing up the salmon, which is fine. Honestly, it's not like the trout is like bad or anything

07:50:56.560 --> 07:51:01.200
I know we'll make it to 40 question is how far in

07:51:04.080 --> 07:51:11.440
True mummy gaming here honestly click simulator, but it's so good though. Like runescape's on a scourge

07:51:12.240 --> 07:51:14.240
Oh

07:51:19.760 --> 07:51:26.320
Look it's like I love how that rune plug in or whatever it's called rune light literally absolutely annihilate now here

07:51:28.320 --> 07:51:34.800
Salmon success rate at 38 is 74 percent. Mmm. That's not bad

07:51:36.400 --> 07:51:38.400
Every one in four

07:51:39.280 --> 07:51:45.040
Okay, who has the exhale spreadsheet an optimal fish cookin

07:51:45.840 --> 07:51:52.240
The best members quest for it is the family crest so you get gloves that were just burning. Oh, I've never done

07:51:52.800 --> 07:51:54.800
I don't know what that is actually

07:51:56.160 --> 07:52:00.720
It sounds difficult though because for something to be such a good item

07:52:01.280 --> 07:52:04.400
I feel like they would have put it behind like really difficult quest

07:52:04.480 --> 07:52:09.600
Oh, if I can pick up a few of these salmon, what may I do for them?

07:52:13.280 --> 07:52:16.800
Rune light is insane. I can never play with a vanilla client again

07:52:18.720 --> 07:52:20.720
Get mugged

07:52:21.520 --> 07:52:24.080
Suppose if you want like super nostalgia, you just leave it as a

07:52:24.880 --> 07:52:28.080
Right, we'll do the trout first because I want like I don't want to

07:52:29.040 --> 07:52:32.000
Have higher rate of burning the salmon since it offers more

07:52:32.960 --> 07:52:34.960
Do you just stream forever strong?

07:52:35.680 --> 07:52:39.280
Um, I just really enjoy streaming and I like hanging out with refunds

07:52:39.360 --> 07:52:45.120
Especially on days where we get to play a multiplayer game where we get to be together. I really like that

07:52:46.560 --> 07:52:53.360
Um, I'm actually going off a bit earlier than expected when maricy comes online in an hour. I'm raiding into our

07:52:54.400 --> 07:53:00.640
And the only reason I'm not doing an endurance today. Hmm is because my voice is very sore

07:53:01.040 --> 07:53:06.320
Um, and I have an ASMR stream tomorrow, so I'm gonna have to try and rest it a bit better than

07:53:07.040 --> 07:53:08.880
than usual

07:53:08.880 --> 07:53:10.880
than the huge

07:53:11.840 --> 07:53:13.840
When again is this old

07:53:15.200 --> 07:53:16.720
Um

Yes, if my voice wasn't sore, I unironically just do 12 hours again. I'm sorry. I would I said it

07:53:23.360 --> 07:53:27.360
I said what we're all thinking you all know. Oh, oh no. I didn't cook those raw salmon

07:53:28.320 --> 07:53:32.880
Silly billy. Oh, no, it's giving me the actual salmon. Oh, hello

07:53:34.400 --> 07:53:39.840
I'm not salmon maxing. I'm not a real salmon max. So I can't believe it. I'm sorry. You had to all find out this way

07:53:41.280 --> 07:53:43.280
Let's do trout

07:53:44.000 --> 07:53:46.400
We're doing we're getting pretty good at trout. We're getting pretty good

07:53:48.080 --> 07:53:51.920
Over eight hours not jerks. Come on. Nice. I don't know. I feel like

07:53:52.720 --> 07:53:56.960
You know when you have like a regular nine and five job like obviously I had quite a few

07:53:58.320 --> 07:54:02.480

Oh my god, wait, is this tuna man back? Hold on. Is tuna man back tuna?

07:54:13.440 --> 07:54:16.240
I thought you had to go do some things with your clan or something

07:54:16.880 --> 07:54:18.880
Oh my god, we're tuna maxing again. Oh

07:54:19.520 --> 07:54:25.520
Half a million. Are you sure? I mean, I ain't going to say no. How are you all so rich?

07:54:27.600 --> 07:54:32.000

How do you make money on runescape? I don't know how I'm going to put this money in the bank

07:54:56.240 --> 07:54:58.240
So I'm not full

07:54:59.200 --> 07:55:02.400
The more you play the higher stats you get raid strongy get

07:55:03.200 --> 07:55:05.600
Get hella high level so we can do raids

07:55:06.720 --> 07:55:08.080
Oh

07:55:08.080 --> 07:55:10.080
What's raiding?

07:55:12.320 --> 07:55:17.280
Oh, you guys teach me how to raid international bank of strongy honestly though

07:55:19.520 --> 07:55:24.400
Oh, I wanted to get a pet that looked like you guys as well. That was another goal. So 99

07:55:25.360 --> 07:55:27.360

07:55:28.080 --> 07:55:30.080
99 um

07:55:30.800 --> 07:55:34.800
Cookin and then I want to get a pet that looks like you guys, but I don't know how the pets work

07:55:36.240 --> 07:55:38.240
Golly, okay

07:55:38.720 --> 07:55:41.440
I'm going to go put this in the bank. No visit

07:55:43.280 --> 07:55:46.560
Math wants to chase math. I don't have much inventory. I'm sorry

07:55:48.800 --> 07:55:53.680
Oh, yeah, give me them sardines you're giving me

Oh made me 39 economic dragon bitter

07:56:10.400 --> 07:56:14.480
Not to be confused with the german word bitter, which means please

07:56:16.480 --> 07:56:21.600
The bitter no, I don't think that's what that means in german

07:56:24.400 --> 07:56:29.520
Also, high level drops peaking. No, I couldn't do peaking. Oh, I'm coming back. Don't worry reeflings. I'm coming back

07:56:29.520 --> 07:56:35.440
I'm mummies. Mummy's putting the money in the bank. I'm coming back. Okay. Mummy needs to pay rent. So I'm putting in the bank

07:56:36.240 --> 07:56:38.480
We need to rent that location out for only us

07:56:39.280 --> 07:56:44.720
A bitter means please. Okay. No reeflings don't cry. I'm coming back. Sorry. I forgot to say that I needed to go

07:56:44.960 --> 07:56:47.280
I'm putting this in the bank. Okay. Look bank

07:56:48.640 --> 07:56:50.640
And look at that we're max

07:56:50.800 --> 07:56:52.800
Look how much fish we've got

07:56:53.200 --> 07:56:55.200
200 raw ship

07:56:55.360 --> 07:56:57.360
600 salmon

07:56:57.760 --> 07:57:04.400
450 swordfish 500 lobsters raw tuna. Like there's so much. I don't want to burn any of this though

07:57:06.080 --> 07:57:12.080
Bitter means you are welcome. Oh, thank you. Sean. That's it. Okay. There we go. There's a sense that you could use them

07:57:13.040 --> 07:57:17.680
I don't know. Thank you. Thank you. Sean or thank you. Sean. No, I think as a

07:57:17.760 --> 07:57:19.760
Huh

07:57:20.080 --> 07:57:23.120
Don't worry reeflings. I'm coming back. Look see I'm coming. I'm coming

07:57:23.920 --> 07:57:28.000
Look look look you're gonna render again. Yay reeflings. All the reeflings are here

07:57:29.920 --> 07:57:35.440
You've got money to burn all that fish. You're loaded. Holy literally a reefling gave me 10 million

07:57:35.520 --> 07:57:37.920
Another gave me a million one. Just give me half a million there

07:57:38.240 --> 07:57:42.240
But I don't want to like I don't want to waste it. I don't want to waste the money

07:57:43.120 --> 07:57:45.120
Oh

07:57:45.760 --> 07:57:47.760
Sorry, sorry. I accept

07:57:48.400 --> 07:57:52.320
Sorry, I'm fish mixing. Okay. Where's mommy? Mommy's back. Mommy's back

07:57:55.040 --> 07:57:58.640
How much xpd get for this? I don't even know you could fish it here

07:58:01.200 --> 07:58:03.200
Can't believe someone went

07:58:04.080 --> 07:58:08.480
What I can't believe someone went more dry than I did on a dragon sick

07:58:09.040 --> 07:58:14.400
Hmm, how much should we get? Oh my god a for these these are the same as fine

07:58:16.800 --> 07:58:18.800
We cease to exist when you leave us. No

07:58:20.960 --> 07:58:23.760
Bitter means a bunch of things including both. Okay

07:58:26.160 --> 07:58:28.160
My German knowledge is expanding

07:58:30.560 --> 07:58:34.560
And now to expand my Puerto Rican knowledge

07:58:34.560 --> 07:58:47.120
I don't know how many pets I've got. Can you own all the pets that one?

07:58:48.800 --> 07:58:53.120
Oh, they're like a little symbol to show what one there's 24 pets

07:58:54.880 --> 07:58:56.880
What how?

07:58:57.120 --> 07:58:59.120
Hmm

07:59:00.640 --> 07:59:05.200
How does there 24 there are 59 pairs? Whoa

07:59:07.360 --> 07:59:09.360
That's a lot

07:59:10.080 --> 07:59:16.320
Yeah, especially because I've a chain makes an avoid worker jam. Is that how you attract pets to you? You were jewelry

07:59:17.920 --> 07:59:20.240
They're ooh shiny. Is there a magpie pet?

07:59:20.480 --> 07:59:22.480
Oh

07:59:25.920 --> 07:59:31.840
Actually, I've picked the place clean. That's how much I'm fish maxing. There's nothing on the ground. I've picked it clean

07:59:32.080 --> 07:59:35.360
Oh wait, there's a trade. Ah, I'm missing

07:59:36.320 --> 07:59:40.240
I've got rubbish aimbot. Whoa. Yeah 17 39

07:59:41.680 --> 07:59:47.840
All salmon. Oh, we're all in on salmon salmon cook and run. We're almost level 40

07:59:48.560 --> 07:59:51.200
40 is like a melody and

07:59:51.840 --> 07:59:53.840
Oh, sorry, I just punched them. I can hear that

07:59:54.800 --> 07:59:56.800
It's a little animated there

07:59:58.480 --> 08:00:01.520
Strongly only just starts you mean she's already a 1% or something

08:00:02.320 --> 08:00:08.400
Wait, really is level 40 a 1% thing like no like hardly anyone gets to 40 and something

08:00:11.040 --> 08:00:16.080
Shorty's like a melody and I kind of can't keep grow. Got me singing like

08:00:17.840 --> 08:00:21.920
Betty days like my eyes. Is it like my eyes porch stuck on the plate?

08:00:26.240 --> 08:00:29.440
Those bars were good. She punched the reef line. I'm sorry

08:00:32.480 --> 08:00:37.360
There's a fishing pet, but you have to be on a member's world to get it and scaling pets are especially

08:00:38.720 --> 08:00:40.720
He means the money

08:00:42.400 --> 08:00:44.400
We hit 40 we hit 40

08:00:47.920 --> 08:00:49.920
Actually so good

08:00:49.920 --> 08:00:52.080
I might make one last cup of tea

08:00:52.960 --> 08:00:54.960
We need a lock in

08:00:56.400 --> 08:01:00.400
Lobster time. Oh, no, I'm not gonna waste in lobster. That's crazy

08:01:02.080 --> 08:01:03.920
I'm not gonna waste

08:01:03.920 --> 08:01:07.520
Oh, I mean unless you give me lobsters. That's different

08:01:08.480 --> 08:01:13.680
If you give me lobsters to waste that's different. I'm not sure what my freaking rate is gonna be

08:01:14.800 --> 08:01:17.440
Burn them all. Oh, I kicked my first one correctly

08:01:18.720 --> 08:01:20.720
Wow

08:01:21.600 --> 08:01:23.600
120

08:01:24.160 --> 08:01:25.680
Oh, no

08:01:25.680 --> 08:01:28.480
They're getting burned. I know you can't see them over my head my heart

08:01:29.520 --> 08:01:32.320
Can I move myself over just a tiny bit more?

08:01:35.600 --> 08:01:38.400
I don't want it actually. Yeah. Yeah

08:01:39.920 --> 08:01:42.960
Okay, yeah, that's better. You can like really see the inventory and stuff

08:01:43.920 --> 08:01:45.920
Learning runes keep learning

08:01:47.840 --> 08:01:53.680
If all the boys get 40 fishing must the point will be for pure lobs

08:01:54.800 --> 08:01:57.680
Wait, you want to do love wait you guys stay up all night

08:01:57.760 --> 08:02:03.120
Just so you can get 40 fishing so we can do lobster runs 120 is a lot

08:02:04.240 --> 08:02:09.920
Look at the success rate though. Where does it say? Oh the success rate is going up. It's 20 percent

08:02:10.880 --> 08:02:14.800
What's that going? Oh, that's my that's my uh

08:02:18.640 --> 08:02:21.360
Oh rest well those two sleep. I'm sorry. I streamed so long

08:02:22.800 --> 08:02:26.720
Uh, for those of you who do need to leave please don't worry. I'm literally doing this until the end

08:02:26.800 --> 08:02:30.160
We're gonna read into mercy because my poor voice is feeling it. Mr. Proud

08:02:30.480 --> 08:02:34.640
There's no way you already have more freaking lobsters for me or something

08:02:35.280 --> 08:02:37.280
Oh, okay. Okay. We go pick go pick

08:02:40.400 --> 08:02:45.040
This is crazy. Can you get in trouble by Jagex for doing this?

08:02:46.000 --> 08:02:52.400
I can stay until 40 fish are for lobsters. That's no, that's crazy. I'm at 31 fishing at the moment

08:02:54.880 --> 08:02:58.240
Got distracted watching you forgot to go back more

08:02:59.760 --> 08:03:01.760
Good night seekers rest well

08:03:01.760 --> 08:03:04.160
Then we can see how much seafood you are wasting. No

08:03:04.400 --> 08:03:06.400
Oh

08:03:06.720 --> 08:03:08.720
I just meant for the lobsters that one

08:03:09.440 --> 08:03:12.080
Long streams are good because I can catch them when I wake up. Hmm

08:03:12.880 --> 08:03:14.880
I will sleep when I'm when I'm

08:03:15.760 --> 08:03:19.440
I'm beat by drowning by more domination achieve

08:03:20.960 --> 08:03:24.880
Oh my god, we're almost 41 all freaking Brady. We just were for him

08:03:25.920 --> 08:03:28.800
Sleep as a construct construct as a government. I'll never give in

08:03:30.480 --> 08:03:32.480
Oh my gosh

08:03:33.440 --> 08:03:36.160
Can we do it? Can we make it 41 already?

08:03:39.280 --> 08:03:43.920
One more don't burn them. No, don't burn them. She I'm she burned it

08:03:45.520 --> 08:03:47.520
40 freaking one

08:03:49.680 --> 08:03:51.680
This is so good

08:03:53.600 --> 08:03:56.400
Oh my god, you're already trading with me

08:03:59.360 --> 08:04:02.080
I hope I can't get in trouble by Jagex for this

08:04:03.440 --> 08:04:06.480
Stuff like this can run the game for new players. So be careful about donations

08:04:09.680 --> 08:04:14.560
I have played like I do have a basic concept of the game, but like if you're gonna ask me to do like

08:04:15.440 --> 08:04:20.080
Dungeoning and stuff. I could not tell you where the gargoyles are, but apparently gargoyles

08:04:20.560 --> 08:04:23.760
Hey, stroney, how do you get a fishing rod? I've never tried this before

08:04:24.720 --> 08:04:26.720
Oh, I'm your tiny culls. Um

08:04:27.600 --> 08:04:34.080
You would have to level up with that fishing net you got from tutorial island, but you can't use it here

08:04:34.080 --> 08:04:36.080
You would have to go back to lumbridge

08:04:37.040 --> 08:04:44.320
This is lumbridge where you came from you can use the magic spell to teleport and you have to do net fishing here until 20

08:04:45.040 --> 08:04:47.440
And then you can come here for a fly fishing

08:04:48.880 --> 08:04:50.880
I'm so sorry little reasoning

08:04:51.200 --> 08:04:55.040
There are gates to level up on fishing. They're probably a lot better than my method

08:04:55.040 --> 08:04:57.040
But that's why I've always used as a kid

08:04:57.600 --> 08:05:02.160
Gargoyles are decent money for mid players, but 75 slurs probably the slowest and

08:05:04.160 --> 08:05:07.680
That burn rates looking a bit rough on the lobsters. I'm not gonna lie

08:05:08.400 --> 08:05:13.120
Anyone got some feathers on them. So well, I guess I'll go great. Oh, thank you little weaklings

08:05:15.360 --> 08:05:17.360
That burn rate is looking rough

08:05:18.880 --> 08:05:20.880
Oh

08:05:20.880 --> 08:05:22.880
About it

08:05:23.520 --> 08:05:25.520
How do you sense the lobsters?

08:05:25.840 --> 08:05:27.840
I feel like they're probably breaking through here

08:05:29.280 --> 08:05:32.400
We're burnt through the fish already. No, we've not I tell a lie

08:05:33.200 --> 08:05:36.960
There's freaking who are you coming so fast like

08:05:38.160 --> 08:05:41.120
You you just handed me them. Is there a bank nearby?

08:05:43.360 --> 08:05:46.560
I thought the bank was over there. Am I going crazy is there a bank up there?

08:05:47.840 --> 08:05:50.560
He's just disappeared again. Is there a bank up there?

08:05:51.840 --> 08:05:54.560
Ageville has a bank. Oh, I'll make sure you

08:05:56.400 --> 08:06:04.880
Call meville because I don't know if I could trade. I'm so sorry. Wait, I'll trade. I'm sorry. I'll trade. I'll trade. I'll trade

08:06:08.080 --> 08:06:10.080
Okay, I'll trade I'll trade

08:06:10.240 --> 08:06:12.240
I'll trade I'll trade

08:06:15.120 --> 08:06:17.120
Bro's hacking

08:06:17.360 --> 08:06:21.840
Can you even hack in RuneScape? That sounds like it's nice and possible because of the way the server is

08:06:22.240 --> 08:06:25.680
Call meville because I'm edging. Yes. Call meville because I'm edging

08:06:29.840 --> 08:06:31.840
Came up with that myself

08:06:33.680 --> 08:06:37.360
You could start using a range closer to the bank rather than the fire rate

08:06:38.080 --> 08:06:42.240
Since you're not fishing anymore, probably that's very true

08:06:48.720 --> 08:06:51.360
Oh, that burn rate is rough on those lobbies

08:06:52.720 --> 08:06:59.200
Every lobster that we burn is a missing like 120 which is like so freaking thingy. I lied. I made it

08:07:00.160 --> 08:07:03.360
Wait, there's another reef link. There's a judge, right? Hold on

08:07:04.320 --> 08:07:07.120
Wait, you've got lobster runs as well

08:07:10.240 --> 08:07:16.240
Isn't this not like thousands like thousands of gold? Am I not going mental? I feel like this is like thousands

08:07:16.240 --> 08:07:18.640
Go ahead and run energy needs to recharge

08:07:20.720 --> 08:07:22.720
Whoa, we got a four streak

08:07:22.720 --> 08:07:24.320
Five in a row?

08:07:24.320 --> 08:07:26.320
42

08:07:27.280 --> 08:07:29.280
Yeah

08:07:30.960 --> 08:07:34.000
It depends on how fast you want to get this level, but our village is more

08:07:36.160 --> 08:07:38.480
Inic, the most cooking ranges

08:07:43.840 --> 08:07:45.840
You can make a million per hour

08:07:48.160 --> 08:07:52.560
A million xp per hour at strony even if they're sizing you have already been given millions

08:07:53.280 --> 08:07:57.040
Honestly, if you tape exclamation mark praise what?

08:08:01.040 --> 08:08:04.560
Stop did you make me fall for something obvious?

08:08:04.560 --> 08:08:06.560
I don't know

08:08:18.720 --> 08:08:26.080
Yeah, I spent 160 on 2k that's like two boss kills. Yeah, you have to take that I'm afterwards. Oh

08:08:28.080 --> 08:08:34.000
Oh, oh need drop need drop. Oh, yeah, that was a much better lobster cooking batch than the previous one

08:08:34.080 --> 08:08:36.080
The other one I absolutely

08:08:39.600 --> 08:08:41.600
Oh

08:08:43.280 --> 08:08:45.280
All right, okay, take that

08:08:46.320 --> 08:08:51.520
Let's try and do this exclamation mark price let all this sit at our

08:08:55.520 --> 08:08:57.520
Oh it works

08:08:58.240 --> 08:09:00.240
Are there 150 a pack?

08:09:00.880 --> 08:09:06.080
Oh, if I buy if I buy feathers from people we drop on okay 300k

08:09:08.640 --> 08:09:12.160
Right don't buy any more fish because it's literally I've got

08:09:12.720 --> 08:09:18.160
Uh less than 50 minutes now. I'm gonna go quickly grab a bottle of water

08:09:30.240 --> 08:09:32.240
Oh

08:09:49.040 --> 08:09:54.880
Oh, I hear burning noises because we're burning the fishes right I got a new ball of war

08:09:55.840 --> 08:10:03.600
I'm so hydrated, but I don't want to pee. I want to fish max. I need to fish max. You don't understand. I'm fish maxing. You wouldn't get it

08:10:05.520 --> 08:10:10.320
I have lobby maxing you wouldn't get it. You wouldn't understand mom. Mom. I need membership

08:10:15.840 --> 08:10:17.840
I'll give it a try be back

08:10:18.240 --> 08:10:20.240
Gobble

08:10:20.240 --> 08:10:23.600
I've only been listening to ASMR for about a minute. So I'm excited for starting ASMR. Wow

08:10:24.800 --> 08:10:29.840
I definitely am not the best. I would say like uh mersey and ac really super professional

08:10:32.720 --> 08:10:34.800
43

08:10:34.800 --> 08:10:39.760
And we've had a lot of two stacks. Oh, I was about to say we've got two stack for all of the lobbies not being burnt

08:10:41.200 --> 08:10:43.200
Spoke too soon there

08:10:46.400 --> 08:10:48.400
Hydration check

08:10:50.960 --> 08:10:52.960
You

08:10:54.640 --> 08:11:00.640
Know as much as the chef hat and the apron are made out of gold. I don't think it's actually making me a better chef

08:11:05.440 --> 08:11:08.400
How much longer before you have to leave is the exact time

08:11:08.720 --> 08:11:10.960
Mersey is coming on in 45 minutes

08:11:10.960 --> 08:11:16.000
I'm gonna redirect into her because I need to do vocal rest before the ASMR stream tomorrow

08:11:16.400 --> 08:11:20.640
And it hurts to talk right now, which is a shame. It's literally the only reason I'm going offline

08:11:20.720 --> 08:11:23.360
I've probably done during stream every single day if I kill it honestly

08:11:24.560 --> 08:11:29.200
Oh, but my voice is sore and I need to be quiet for the ASMR

08:11:30.320 --> 08:11:34.640
Uh tomorrow's gonna be a short no you guys are so quick on it

08:11:36.240 --> 08:11:38.240
This is crazy

08:11:38.240 --> 08:11:40.880
It doesn't make sense. They're gold literally

08:11:41.120 --> 08:11:48.480
Doing some nice hot tea. Yes. I've had too much tea to do because I put honey in my tea. It gets like

08:11:49.280 --> 08:11:53.280
Sickly if I have too much of it. So I have to swap a water only

08:11:54.800 --> 08:12:00.960
What's your target that you're going for this stream? I wanted to get 50, but I don't think it's possible because of time

08:12:01.840 --> 08:12:05.440
I didn't realize how fast cooking the fish was gonna be

08:12:06.160 --> 08:12:11.360
If I wasn't like doing those quests, but I had fun doing quests for the weasel and so actually I don't really regret at all

08:12:12.240 --> 08:12:17.040
It's I'll be cutting it close like if we're literally like a couple of minutes away, then I'll do it

08:12:17.600 --> 08:12:19.600
But unfortunately my voice is like

08:12:21.200 --> 08:12:23.920
I'm the most I felt that one literally

08:12:25.520 --> 08:12:27.520
I do look stylish though. I mean look at that

08:12:28.480 --> 08:12:30.480
Oh

08:12:32.080 --> 08:12:36.880
Look at the detail in my eyes and everything the polys is favorite all the going

08:12:38.640 --> 08:12:44.560
Honey team's good. Maybe add less honey. I don't know. I feel like sickly if I

08:12:45.920 --> 08:12:47.920
It's just not working

08:12:48.640 --> 08:12:50.640
It's just not working

08:12:51.760 --> 08:12:53.200
I know

08:12:53.200 --> 08:12:57.200
Um, you can have those throat sweets, but I don't know if they actually do anything

08:12:57.520 --> 08:13:03.600
Or just like make my teeth feel a little sugary. It's like my biggest freaking thing. Wait, hold on. Am I taking

08:13:04.320 --> 08:13:06.320
I can't remember who I keep taking off all

08:13:07.520 --> 08:13:12.400
I'm sorry for whoever the other lobster runners. Like I like I can't remember between

08:13:13.680 --> 08:13:16.240
200 k feathers under me. Damn

08:13:17.440 --> 08:13:19.440
Damn

08:13:19.680 --> 08:13:21.680
Damn, you're in a wedding dress and everything

08:13:23.200 --> 08:13:29.680
All of you black hair. This is you and your little cape. Oh, I forgot to get his green capes. Oops. We'll do the next thing

08:13:31.040 --> 08:13:33.440
Can you say throw sweets again? Yeah, throw sweets

08:13:34.480 --> 08:13:38.960
They like help with your throat when you feel sick or whatever or if you've got strain again

08:13:41.360 --> 08:13:48.500
You're still screaming. Yeah, um, we've got roughly 40 minutes and then it's mercy time. We're gonna redirect into mercy

08:13:53.600 --> 08:13:55.600
Oh

08:13:58.480 --> 08:14:06.560
I'm making an absolute mockery of this one. I think I'm gonna burn there. Yeah over close to the 44 though

08:14:10.560 --> 08:14:12.560
Rikola

08:14:13.200 --> 08:14:15.200
Wait Rikola

08:14:18.080 --> 08:14:20.080
Wait, what's Rikola?

08:14:21.040 --> 08:14:23.040
I can hear that Rikola

08:14:33.920 --> 08:14:38.720
A tape of throat lozenger. Oh, it's a cough drug. Rikola is a brand

08:14:39.280 --> 08:14:41.280
Oh, okay. Oh, sorry

08:14:43.280 --> 08:14:45.280
Here you go

08:14:46.080 --> 08:14:51.600
Lobster runner, I can't believe it. Might as well do 99 rune crafting while we're at it. You guys will make it super easy

08:14:55.280 --> 08:15:00.080
It's the comical jingle that was very common. Oh, it's a commercial jingle. Sorry

08:15:01.840 --> 08:15:03.840
I see I see I see

08:15:04.720 --> 08:15:07.200
But not ac smoke but I see

08:15:10.080 --> 08:15:12.080
There's a new

08:15:12.960 --> 08:15:14.960
New rune craft minigame and it's fun

08:15:15.680 --> 08:15:20.960
Anyone else? They won't see the feathers yet. No, you might have to pick them up in case it's too much when you despawn

08:15:23.280 --> 08:15:25.280
No feathers

08:15:28.560 --> 08:15:32.080
Yeah, hopefully they don't despawn because 20k feathers isn't cheap

08:15:35.680 --> 08:15:37.680
Did you time this

08:15:42.480 --> 08:15:45.440
How long does it take after dolphin? I thought it was 60 seconds

08:15:46.800 --> 08:15:52.800
If it's been 60 seconds, I would scoop them back up again because I would hate for them to no not the head buy-ins

08:16:00.480 --> 08:16:02.480
Level 40 freaking four

08:16:04.880 --> 08:16:08.080
If I could stop freaking burning them lobsters, oh wow

08:16:08.880 --> 08:16:10.880
Well, accept trade accept trade

08:16:19.120 --> 08:16:27.360
We're getting there though. Do you have less burn chance on a grill thing? An oven? A grill thing

08:16:28.960 --> 08:16:35.360
30 seconds to appear to others three minutes to despawn. Hmm. We're learning. We're learning the ways of runes game

08:16:38.400 --> 08:16:40.400
You

08:16:41.920 --> 08:16:43.920
Know only

08:16:47.840 --> 08:16:51.440
Range and fire are the same kissing chance mostly. Okay, there's no point

08:16:52.080 --> 08:16:55.040
I was like, maybe we should move this production line

08:16:55.600 --> 08:16:56.640
but

08:16:56.640 --> 08:17:00.160
And the the reef ones are just fishing away. They're just having a good time

08:17:02.720 --> 08:17:04.960
We definitely need to level ourselves up

08:17:05.920 --> 08:17:11.520
Because we're we're the target for like a lot of NPCs like when we're trying to travel through areas

08:17:12.800 --> 08:17:14.800
So

08:17:16.640 --> 08:17:21.360
Streams end in 40 minutes. Does that mean brush teeth intend? Oh, yes. We have to brush your teeth

08:17:23.520 --> 08:17:27.200
Okay, thank goodness I didn't make another tea because I wouldn't have been able to brush my teeth

08:17:28.160 --> 08:17:29.760
Uh

08:17:29.760 --> 08:17:32.640
If you're having if you want to brush your teeth with us

08:17:33.360 --> 08:17:36.160
Um for your enamel don't

08:17:37.280 --> 08:17:39.280
Eat or drink fizzy juice

08:17:39.680 --> 08:17:44.320
You can have water for like the next 30 minutes, but you're not to brush your teeth if you've eaten

08:17:45.280 --> 08:17:47.040
after 30 minutes

08:17:47.040 --> 08:17:50.160
Because it hurts your enamel that rather than helping it

08:17:51.360 --> 08:17:54.240
I think that's my only note if you want to brush your teeth with us

08:17:55.200 --> 08:18:02.240
It's not so fun story. My brother once choked on one of those throat sweeps and helped with the throat throat

08:18:03.920 --> 08:18:05.920
Oh, that's terrifying

08:18:07.200 --> 08:18:09.200
45

08:18:09.760 --> 08:18:16.400
45 45 we're at 61 eight feet. Oh my goodness. We may actually make the 50. You know that

08:18:17.360 --> 08:18:19.360
I

08:18:20.400 --> 08:18:24.080
Throat farted when I swallowed it. Did you hear that? That was like an internal throat

08:18:26.560 --> 08:18:30.720
Strony is the cuttlefish and the reeflings are her arms. Most people think it's like

08:18:37.840 --> 08:18:39.840
One in three

08:18:39.840 --> 08:18:41.840
Oh

08:18:43.920 --> 08:18:51.440
He learned so much from this education on professional streamer that takes me back to the toothbrush and ASMR

08:18:59.360 --> 08:19:02.560
We are so gonna get 50 before mercy comes on a mind me funny

08:19:03.360 --> 08:19:07.920
Oh mercy is actually I think she's decorating alternative outfits for us

08:19:08.880 --> 08:19:10.240
So

08:19:10.240 --> 08:19:12.240
We are in

08:19:12.800 --> 08:19:18.240
Have our lobster reserves run dry. Have I perished all the lobsters for sale in the grand exchange?

08:19:20.080 --> 08:19:22.580
Oh unless unless unless

08:19:24.560 --> 08:19:29.120
There you guys are sweating to get me to level 99 you're actually so kind

08:19:29.120 --> 08:19:33.040
I just want to say special. Thank you for those of you who are like unironically feeding me

08:19:33.600 --> 08:19:36.320
This is gonna make the school way faster doing this

08:19:38.160 --> 08:19:40.160
Hmm

08:19:46.240 --> 08:19:48.240
You'd say that strong he's a really good drop. What?

08:19:49.840 --> 08:19:52.560
Do you think she'd meet you one of those? What?

08:19:54.160 --> 08:19:58.640
What's going on? No stops on this lobster train. Literally

08:20:02.960 --> 08:20:04.960
I know the fishing spot

08:20:08.640 --> 08:20:11.520
Nearly 1 million xp an hour stop is it?

08:20:12.320 --> 08:20:14.080
unblockies

08:20:14.080 --> 08:20:16.080
I love stories

08:20:16.160 --> 08:20:20.640
I suppose if I didn't burn them that's very plausible every stack is like

08:20:22.160 --> 08:20:24.160
What 26 inventory?

08:20:25.600 --> 08:20:27.600
Like

08:20:27.840 --> 08:20:29.920
I think five tables are shooting it. I don't know

08:20:31.680 --> 08:20:36.640
With some tick manipulation. I don't know what's the tick rate manipulation stuff means

08:20:36.720 --> 08:20:38.720
I hear it all the time though

08:20:38.960 --> 08:20:41.840
It's like, oh, you just gotta make sure you do this on the tick and you have to eat

08:20:42.080 --> 08:20:46.880
You have to eat the food on the tick. Oh, can I swap out prayer? I need prayer flick. I need a prayer flick

08:20:46.960 --> 08:20:48.960
Like I'm like, what does any of this mean?

08:20:51.600 --> 08:20:53.440
You're crazy

08:20:53.440 --> 08:20:55.440
crazy

08:20:56.240 --> 08:21:00.800
Also for those of you using ruin light if you don't want an item name to show up

08:21:01.600 --> 08:21:07.120
Can hold all and write the irons

08:21:09.200 --> 08:21:11.200
We're getting them

08:21:14.320 --> 08:21:17.200
Being an apron has always been a dream of mine

08:21:18.720 --> 08:21:23.200
The game runs on 0.6 second increments called ticks. That's it. Oh

08:21:26.640 --> 08:21:30.160
That basic okay, that just like explains everything

08:21:31.760 --> 08:21:35.760
That's it. That's all it took one one sense and it all makes sense

08:21:36.160 --> 08:21:39.520
Okay, because I was like prayer. I need prayer flick on this

08:21:40.400 --> 08:21:42.400
Over prayer flail. I'm like, what?

08:21:43.040 --> 08:21:45.520
I'm not I'm even sure that's supposed to be having the games played

08:21:45.520 --> 08:21:51.440
I don't know did the devs intend that but they never patched it out. So I guess prayer flicking is the right way to go

08:21:52.960 --> 08:21:54.960
Because prayer run drains so fast

08:21:55.840 --> 08:22:02.800
It's running smart. I'm I'm I'm getting new brain cells just from streaming. Hmm

08:22:04.880 --> 08:22:06.880
Level 47

08:22:06.960 --> 08:22:08.400
No

08:22:08.400 --> 08:22:10.400
Oh wait, sorry

08:22:10.960 --> 08:22:13.920
Two more if I don't burn these if I don't burn this one

08:22:16.320 --> 08:22:19.760
46 oh my gosh

08:22:21.040 --> 08:22:23.040
We're so MLG pro

08:22:23.840 --> 08:22:25.840
Look at me bro MLG pro

08:22:27.680 --> 08:22:30.800
I'm gonna come he's rumbling if you could hear that over the background

08:22:31.920 --> 08:22:33.920
Wow

08:22:34.720 --> 08:22:36.720
I'm literally solid

08:22:38.320 --> 08:22:41.040
It's not intended but jaguars just accept it

08:22:41.040 --> 08:22:44.960
I was gonna say if they didn't whenever like something gets discovered

08:22:45.520 --> 08:22:50.080
Like so this is for the overwatch players, but mercy had a guardian angel leak. Um

08:22:50.400 --> 08:22:52.400
And

08:22:52.560 --> 08:22:58.880
It got discovered and it was never patched out the game which meant it was intended even though it was never described

08:22:59.840 --> 08:23:02.400
So that's how I take it if the devs don't patch it out

08:23:03.120 --> 08:23:05.120
It's allowed basically

08:23:06.320 --> 08:23:09.360
Once you get to level 92 you're halfway there. Yay

08:23:11.040 --> 08:23:13.920
Anyway, congrats dumb dumb. This was the stream I was looking forward

08:23:14.640 --> 08:23:17.680
The list ended up probably being one of the funniest really

08:23:18.640 --> 08:23:22.480
It's just me receiving like tons of in-game currency for doing nothing

08:23:25.280 --> 08:23:30.080
Yes, but please don't worry if you're interested in a more like multiplayer games where we can play together

08:23:30.560 --> 08:23:35.280
Um, I definitely am doing like a whole variety of things going on. Um

08:23:40.480 --> 08:23:43.120
I would definitely like other ones like um

08:23:43.920 --> 08:23:49.600
Jail, no, that's not its official name. What's the name of the game? Uh fall guys

08:23:50.320 --> 08:23:56.720
Um, I wanted to give fortnite a chance apparently fortnite. Um has added like different game modes

08:23:57.440 --> 08:24:03.920
Um, uh call of duty has apparently introduced prop hunt. I don't know if we could oh, there's a captain

08:24:04.000 --> 08:24:06.480
Do we do the captain mini one mini quest?

08:24:08.160 --> 08:24:10.160
I don't know if we do the captain one

08:24:10.400 --> 08:24:12.400
At the fortnite

08:24:13.360 --> 08:24:15.360
metal path

08:24:15.680 --> 08:24:17.680
I just shit out my head

08:24:18.960 --> 08:24:20.160
It's

08:24:20.160 --> 08:24:22.160
Is it bad?

08:24:23.360 --> 08:24:25.360
Is it a bad quest?

08:24:25.360 --> 08:24:27.360
Is it the captain or is it a good one?

08:24:28.160 --> 08:24:30.400
It's quick. Okay, if it's quick, let's try it

08:24:31.520 --> 08:24:34.960
Problem is these old time, uh, sure. I'll help you unlock your chest

08:24:36.400 --> 08:24:39.840
There are three columns. What you need to do is match up each picture

08:24:40.160 --> 08:24:42.160
on the column

08:24:44.240 --> 08:24:47.600
A bar a ring and a bowl

08:24:51.600 --> 08:24:53.600
Oh got a wee golden ring

08:24:55.120 --> 08:24:56.400
Um

08:24:56.400 --> 08:25:00.640
What I do would it I already have a diamond ring on from a reefland so I can't take off

08:25:02.800 --> 08:25:07.280
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. I completely forgot we're trying to lobster max right now. Oops

08:25:07.520 --> 08:25:12.400
Uh one one life space because I I'll drop the golden ring

08:25:17.120 --> 08:25:19.440
Oh, I could have gave you the golden ring actually because

08:25:20.080 --> 08:25:23.280
lobsters trading there the rings your problem now

08:25:27.760 --> 08:25:34.080
Captain is the worst random no the sign which lady is she never gives you anything good

08:25:34.080 --> 08:25:39.600
Hail divers molly player. Is that easy to say?

08:25:46.720 --> 08:25:49.040
Well same which lady and chris master

08:25:50.880 --> 08:25:53.200
Chris master is rubbish. I don't like that one

08:25:55.680 --> 08:26:02.240
Uh for strutty, please don't play for tonight. Oh, no, what's wrong? It's bad game

08:26:04.960 --> 08:26:06.080
I

08:26:06.080 --> 08:26:09.120
Get that still but yeah, I think it's kind of drop in drop out

08:26:11.360 --> 08:26:17.360
Um, I would like to play among us so I can start screaming at you and I'll be like it's red it's red wavelength

08:26:17.360 --> 08:26:19.360
You don't believe me. It's red

08:26:22.960 --> 08:26:26.560
But we'll have to we'll have to try and see what happens

08:26:26.560 --> 08:26:28.560
Okay

08:26:31.680 --> 08:26:33.680
Okay, I'm done

08:26:33.680 --> 08:26:37.920
I'm so I'm so emoji look at me like I'm literally hover and ready for the trade offer like yeah

08:26:37.920 --> 08:26:42.800
Yeah, give me the trade offer. Oh look your problem now. There you go. Oh your problem now

08:26:45.440 --> 08:26:48.640
There you go all yours golden rings yours. Thank you for all the lobsters

08:26:49.520 --> 08:26:51.520
I

08:26:53.120 --> 08:26:55.120
Among us

08:26:55.920 --> 08:26:59.200
You've never played among us deep rock galactica

08:27:00.160 --> 08:27:02.160
We can play deep rock together

08:27:02.720 --> 08:27:05.520
Can I force you guys to play that mains of maria game with me?

08:27:07.600 --> 08:27:11.600
I'm too scared to ask the girls to play in case they absolutely despise it so

08:27:12.960 --> 08:27:14.960
Although I may be able to convince she be

08:27:15.760 --> 08:27:23.840
There's a mains of mario game. It's like it's literally deep rock galactica, but lord of the rings could it

08:27:25.840 --> 08:27:29.440
You want to try warframe is freeing up to four man squads. Oh

08:27:31.760 --> 08:27:34.000
I think you can force us to do anything you want to try

08:27:34.560 --> 08:27:36.560
I

08:27:40.720 --> 08:27:45.360
Haven't ever heard of it and never got advertised well the only reason it popped up for me is because

08:27:45.760 --> 08:27:48.000
I'm on lord of the rings side of tech talk

08:27:49.200 --> 08:27:53.120
So if there's anything lord of the rings lord that the rings related

08:27:54.000 --> 08:27:56.000
Oh my god, we're gonna level up

08:27:56.880 --> 08:27:58.880
40 freaking seven

08:28:00.080 --> 08:28:02.080
Oh my gosh

08:28:03.040 --> 08:28:07.200
This is getting insane xp game oh crap

08:28:09.840 --> 08:28:17.120
Thank you. Thank you reeflings. I appreciate it. Literally everyone feeding to me. We're all like fishing away leveling up and stuff

08:28:21.520 --> 08:28:23.520
Um, I think we'll play

08:28:24.480 --> 08:28:26.480
RuneScape during

08:28:27.040 --> 08:28:33.840
Uh on the third week of streams, I think they'll might we'll might do a double runescape to make sure we really get there xp

08:28:33.840 --> 08:28:34.400
wise

08:28:34.400 --> 08:28:39.280
I'll break it up in between the week just so it's not like a full day of runescape and then one right after it

08:28:39.520 --> 08:28:43.360
Because I know runescape isn't for everyone. I know it might be a bit um

08:28:43.920 --> 08:28:46.880
Of a snooze fest, but for me it's so satisfying like

08:28:47.920 --> 08:28:49.920
Not bigger number

08:28:50.240 --> 08:28:52.880
Bigger number big number big number big number

08:28:53.440 --> 08:28:55.440
Like it's like really good for me

08:28:55.680 --> 08:29:01.200
But I guess maybe watching it. It might be better. Like if it was a compilation or like a highlight, you know

08:29:02.880 --> 08:29:07.840
Still do warframe. It's the worst game to be a new player and 100% confusing and there's a neat tutorial

08:29:08.240 --> 08:29:11.040
Deep rock season five is a bit of a horror show right now

08:29:16.560 --> 08:29:18.560
Number go up

08:29:19.520 --> 08:29:26.000
RuneScape is definitely a talking stream like a datzu like back and forth. I like memeing with one each other

08:29:27.200 --> 08:29:29.200
I'm like learning about the game and stuff

08:29:30.960 --> 08:29:36.880
I don't know enough about runescape. Literally. I like I I wasn't kidding when I said like the best I did as a kid was like

08:29:37.680 --> 08:29:43.200
Do cooking and then like probably like do 40 and then that's the best like I actually don't know how the game works

08:29:44.720 --> 08:29:47.280
So much lobster rock lobster

08:29:48.560 --> 08:29:50.560
Dumb

08:29:59.040 --> 08:30:01.040
Uh b52 is anyone

08:30:05.600 --> 08:30:07.600
The reefing

08:30:07.840 --> 08:30:15.840
Is could you trouble you to play voices of the void? I don't know what that is. Is that an mmo or like single

08:30:16.800 --> 08:30:18.800
Or what what kind of game

08:30:20.800 --> 08:30:22.800
This reefing is deep one

08:30:23.040 --> 08:30:25.040
final fantasy 14

08:30:26.240 --> 08:30:28.240
I was gonna give it a shot

08:30:28.960 --> 08:30:30.960
um

08:30:31.360 --> 08:30:33.360
But yeah

08:30:34.560 --> 08:30:36.560
I never ended up playing it

08:30:36.800 --> 08:30:40.000
I don't know if it's I don't know if they say the role play a lot on it

08:30:40.960 --> 08:30:42.400
honestly

08:30:42.400 --> 08:30:44.400
I don't mind

08:30:44.640 --> 08:30:46.640
It'll be fun to role play

08:30:49.600 --> 08:30:51.600
A role play is what

08:30:54.560 --> 08:30:56.560
I don't know what

08:31:07.280 --> 08:31:09.280
Oh, wait, sorry

08:31:10.960 --> 08:31:12.960
Save heroes is free to play

08:31:15.280 --> 08:31:19.200
Super hero animal. Oh, I think I said I wanted to play Marvel rivals

08:31:19.200 --> 08:31:24.880
We might play that but I don't know if it's in beta beta beta beta

08:31:25.280 --> 08:31:29.680
Um, or if that's it fully out. I don't know. Oh my tummy's wobbling

08:31:31.120 --> 08:31:32.960
I don't know what to do

08:31:32.960 --> 08:31:36.720
Stroney and our 100 husbands isn't this the life though

08:31:39.440 --> 08:31:42.240
You know, you have to wait to get your one-on-one attention

08:31:42.320 --> 08:31:50.400
But then that makes it so much more worth it. Why did I keep freaking snail blinking? I'm gonna have to change that

08:31:52.000 --> 08:31:54.560
Please stop blinking one at a time

08:31:56.560 --> 08:31:58.560
I'm gonna have to make this sensitivity

08:31:59.040 --> 08:32:00.800
different

08:32:00.800 --> 08:32:02.400
any

08:32:02.400 --> 08:32:04.880
interest in trying lord of the rings online

08:32:05.440 --> 08:32:07.440
I

08:32:09.040 --> 08:32:10.160
Like

08:32:10.160 --> 08:32:16.560
Shadow and what lord of the rings online? You mean elven scrolls online or is there like a lord of the rings online?

08:32:16.560 --> 08:32:18.560
I have no idea about

08:32:20.880 --> 08:32:25.280
I'm actually playing final fantasy while watching the stream speaking facts cannot disagree

08:32:27.920 --> 08:32:31.680
I work in accounting and I'm the only guy with nine girls and that was a

08:32:32.240 --> 08:32:36.480
What ladies man, check you out. You get a nice view all day long

08:32:38.560 --> 08:32:41.680
There's a lord of the rings. Maybe I've seen it and I'm just being a dumb dumb

08:32:43.760 --> 08:32:46.320
I can't recall it off the toilet in the head

08:32:52.320 --> 08:32:57.520
Should I move I feel like I'm like in the way here. Oh, I can't even access the fire. Oh

08:32:58.240 --> 08:33:00.240
I can't even access the fire

08:33:01.200 --> 08:33:04.000
Dumb dumb. Oh, sorry. I'm already accepted

08:33:05.280 --> 08:33:08.720
It's pretty old. Does lord of the rings online still even have server? Yeah, I don't even

08:33:09.360 --> 08:33:11.360
I don't even think I've seen any gameplay of it

08:33:12.240 --> 08:33:15.200
Unless I have and my brain's just not putting them two together

08:33:16.560 --> 08:33:21.920
171 successful cooks to go. Not sure how many include in burning. So probably 10 more trips

08:33:23.200 --> 08:33:24.480
Wow

08:33:24.480 --> 08:33:26.480
We're at 81,000

08:33:26.880 --> 08:33:33.280
XP on cooking we need 20k more wins mercy 20 minutes on mercy. I don't know

08:33:36.400 --> 08:33:38.400
If we could stop burning

08:33:41.120 --> 08:33:45.200
There's no way you're still head banging over there. Are you not tired of clicking the button?

08:33:48.000 --> 08:33:56.080
Finally lord of the ring is microtransaction to heck. Okay, that's probably why I haven't heard about it because everyone just saw how much of a grab it was

08:33:57.440 --> 08:34:02.000
I lost my little face. Yeah, maybe I am maybe I'm just head banging

08:34:03.600 --> 08:34:10.160
I mean barb village is it? Yeah, I don't I we might maybe do like a watch along of stuff

08:34:10.960 --> 08:34:12.960
and

08:34:13.280 --> 08:34:16.800
For like the later levels oh 48 man

08:34:18.000 --> 08:34:23.760
That's so good. I literally I was aiming for 40 and I'm like so happy with what we've got

08:34:23.840 --> 08:34:30.960
Obviously special shout out to the reeflings who are supplying a ridiculous amount of money and fish and everything to me

08:34:31.440 --> 08:34:33.440
Because it is insane

08:34:36.160 --> 08:34:39.040
And literally the reeflings down here that are just chilling and fishing away there

08:34:39.120 --> 08:34:41.120
They're just having a good time leveling up fishing

08:34:41.840 --> 08:34:46.880
What are your fishing levels? Hold on. Let me type fishing level check

08:34:47.840 --> 08:34:49.840
Fishing level check

08:34:54.640 --> 08:34:57.920
I'm still struggling early game fishing and cooking south of lombardy shrimp

08:34:58.320 --> 08:35:02.480
It takes forever to net some shrimp and then you burn them to heck

08:35:03.120 --> 08:35:07.360
If you guys want to catch up to her, I'll give you what I have left after stream

08:35:10.160 --> 08:35:13.840
Out of curiosity, are you avoiding profanity for any reason?

08:35:14.480 --> 08:35:16.400
a little bit the ai

08:35:16.400 --> 08:35:23.120
Can tell like the ai can read what my voice is so I kind of try and swap out words over time

08:35:24.240 --> 08:35:26.240
um because I am quite

08:35:27.040 --> 08:35:32.640
Outrageous at certain sections, so I try and tone it down as long as you get like a good 80 to any like mix

08:35:33.280 --> 08:35:36.720
Then overall you're fine, which is why I swap out words sometimes

08:35:39.360 --> 08:35:42.240
I have enough eggs to be for night night twice unfortunately

08:35:43.680 --> 08:35:46.720
Little reeflings cute surprise of the stream

08:35:48.240 --> 08:35:50.240
Oh we keep burning them

08:35:50.560 --> 08:35:52.560
Ah

08:35:52.960 --> 08:35:59.200
Oh lobbies you're not as easy to cook as I I thought my little my caviar

08:36:08.080 --> 08:36:14.080
Yes, I maybe need to think of like maybe we watch movies and that whilst we runescape in the background or something

08:36:14.960 --> 08:36:16.960
I mean I can do set up watch one movie

08:36:17.920 --> 08:36:22.800
And obviously I can't show it back and show the timer so as we jump in at any point

08:36:23.360 --> 08:36:25.920
Maybe harry potter. Do you guys like harry potter?

08:36:28.560 --> 08:36:31.760
I've watched it through for the first time

08:36:32.800 --> 08:36:39.600
A couple years back. I'm not doing the full thing not okay. Maybe not. Sorry. Sorry. Maybe not. Maybe it's the girls movie. Apologies

08:36:41.600 --> 08:36:46.240
Is there a see John wick series? We'll watch the John wick series

08:36:47.040 --> 08:36:49.040
Movies that would be a good one

08:36:51.120 --> 08:36:57.520
Hmm, I think everyone who's ready for runescape and chill honestly John wick runescape and chill

08:36:58.720 --> 08:37:04.240
I'll put down the sound of the game like really low and we'll just watch the movie and it's just me going

08:37:05.280 --> 08:37:08.240
In the movie and then every time I level up I also go

08:37:11.200 --> 08:37:15.600
The first three movies of harry potter is pretty comfortable. Yeah, I guess really dark at the end which I don't

08:37:16.400 --> 08:37:19.440
You could do a pool on which movies. Yeah

08:37:21.120 --> 08:37:23.440
Uh just because of how long

08:37:24.720 --> 08:37:29.600
Like the grains are I would kind of want to do series movies and um

08:37:32.560 --> 08:37:37.440
John wick has three installments. I'm pretty sure which is why I quite like that

08:37:38.400 --> 08:37:40.400
Hmm

08:37:43.360 --> 08:37:49.200
What about shrek? Oh, I don't like the leader shirt. Is it shrek happily ever after?

08:37:55.040 --> 08:37:57.040
John wick has four

08:37:59.520 --> 08:38:05.680
Have I seen the fourth one? I might know you haven't seen the fourth one. I don't know there's a fourth installment

08:38:06.640 --> 08:38:08.640
Huh

08:38:09.520 --> 08:38:14.320
I have a silly idea. What's your idea? Hmm. You have me curious speak your truth

08:38:15.200 --> 08:38:17.200
Stroney, how do you feel about spider-man movies?

08:38:17.920 --> 08:38:22.000
You want to watch the original spider-man's like the toby mcguire?

08:38:22.880 --> 08:38:25.760
Spider-man so we can all have a gig a lot of the dancing

08:38:27.920 --> 08:38:29.920
Toby mcguire is my spider-man

08:38:30.160 --> 08:38:36.160
I remember it like a freaking babbling and watching the movies practically

08:38:39.040 --> 08:38:42.960
Yeah, the fourth the final chapter is the fourth. Oh, okay, okay, okay

08:38:45.440 --> 08:38:50.400
Stroney, did you know that lord of the rings trilogy lasts less than one of your endurance streams?

08:38:50.800 --> 08:38:56.000
I'm saving myself. I'm saving myself for the lord of the rings on christmas day

08:38:56.560 --> 08:39:00.720
I am abstaining from such beautiful literature

08:39:01.680 --> 08:39:05.440
Uh, such beautiful media that was created for human consumption

08:39:06.320 --> 08:39:08.320
Um, so

08:39:08.400 --> 08:39:10.400
We're not gonna watch them

08:39:11.520 --> 08:39:13.520
for this

08:39:14.960 --> 08:39:18.160
The sam remi trilogy. Yeah, spider-man 3

08:39:18.960 --> 08:39:23.920
I don't think I saw that one. I didn't see any of the spider-man's that have emma stone in it

08:39:26.960 --> 08:39:28.960
But I watched spider-man

08:39:30.000 --> 08:39:32.240
We're all three of them. We're in the same movie

08:39:34.400 --> 08:39:39.040
And toby was like, yeah, it just comes out of my wrist and the other two were like, huh?

08:39:40.240 --> 08:39:42.560
Because I couldn't believe it because I think the new

08:39:43.600 --> 08:39:50.960
Oh, I'm really bad with people's names. The new spider-man has to use nanotechnology from iron man to get his gunk out

08:39:52.400 --> 08:39:54.400
Um, I don't know what

08:39:55.360 --> 08:39:57.360
Garfield

08:39:57.360 --> 08:39:59.920
Honestly, any of the spider-man movies views are great. Okay

08:40:01.680 --> 08:40:07.040
49. Oh my gosh 49 just popped feels good, man

08:40:08.960 --> 08:40:11.280
Tom Holland. Aye, his name's Tom Holland

08:40:17.120 --> 08:40:21.760
I sing the praises of the apocrity diaries to anyone who will listen. Is it movie?

08:40:22.720 --> 08:40:28.480
I'm not heard of it. If it's a game or a movie

08:40:33.840 --> 08:40:35.840
Oh, my tummy's so hungry

08:40:37.360 --> 08:40:41.920
But I can't make food. I must grind. I must fish max. We are fish maxing

08:40:44.880 --> 08:40:48.720
We hitting 50 before mercy before I think so

08:40:49.600 --> 08:40:52.880
We are like blasting through these levels. It's crazy

08:40:55.120 --> 08:40:57.600
0.7 of the weight of 99 let's go

08:41:00.080 --> 08:41:02.080
Oh, I read apocrity novel

08:41:03.520 --> 08:41:05.520
Aren't there like seven Highlander movies?

08:41:07.360 --> 08:41:11.200
It's mad max a one-off movie. I think so

08:41:12.560 --> 08:41:15.600
That new mad max I think is good

08:41:16.160 --> 08:41:19.600
The one that was like witness me and he puts spray can on his teeth

08:41:20.960 --> 08:41:22.960
That one's pretty good

08:41:24.080 --> 08:41:30.240
Those one-off movies are oh, sorry. I just click I miss click. Oh, sorry. Sorry the grind the grind, please

08:41:30.480 --> 08:41:33.200
The lobster maxing. I can't do it if I'm all miss clicking

08:41:33.920 --> 08:41:35.920
It was a miss input miss input

08:41:36.480 --> 08:41:38.480
Fury road was one

08:41:39.600 --> 08:41:43.680
XP waste no, don't bully me over my xp wasting

08:41:46.080 --> 08:41:54.080
It says I need 54 cooks and I've got 5th level 50 if I can stop burning them. Maybe two more inventory's of lobbies

08:41:55.840 --> 08:41:57.840
Oh, maybe two we can do it into

08:42:01.760 --> 08:42:03.760
We're

08:42:04.080 --> 08:42:10.800
If only I know how many hours I spent bank standing. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

08:42:11.040 --> 08:42:13.040
I

08:42:13.520 --> 08:42:15.520
Think your ping may be blessed

08:42:17.120 --> 08:42:19.680
Get that fire on get that fire on get that lobby on the fire

08:42:21.200 --> 08:42:23.200
Not the miss input

08:42:24.800 --> 08:42:27.920
Blade runner. Oh, that's a good suggestion

08:42:31.680 --> 08:42:33.280
I thought about

08:42:33.280 --> 08:42:35.680
because of the rile ryan

08:42:36.320 --> 08:42:37.920
Gosling ryan gosling

08:42:37.920 --> 08:42:41.600
But I don't know why that was so hard to say ryan because of the ryan goslin movies

08:42:41.840 --> 08:42:47.280
I thought it would be funny if we did like a six girl watch along of it like all six of us watching it

08:42:47.840 --> 08:42:53.840
And then whenever ryan comes on screen all of us can be like, oh, that's literally my refling

08:42:53.920 --> 08:42:58.640
That's literally my like fleeting heart. That's literally my snippet. That's literally my pinpal

08:42:59.200 --> 08:43:01.200
Oh

08:43:02.800 --> 08:43:04.800
I'm on world 380

08:43:05.760 --> 08:43:12.320
At barbarian village. Unfortunately. I'm literally about to go off in 13 minutes rip because mercy is coming online

08:43:14.080 --> 08:43:17.200
And literally oh my god, that's my refill a bit. Oh my god. My roof was so strong

08:43:18.480 --> 08:43:20.800
I'm gonna just be like complimenting you the entire stream

08:43:21.600 --> 08:43:32.560
Okay, it says 34 more lobsters. Okay, this time two more inventories. I'll do it because I can't stop burning these lobbies

08:43:38.000 --> 08:43:40.000
That goes like literally

08:43:41.040 --> 08:43:44.800
I wouldn't mind rewatching the blade runner because I didn't like fully comprehend it

08:43:46.400 --> 08:43:48.400
I'm at first

08:43:48.960 --> 08:43:52.880
So it'd be nice to like see again kind of mildly knowing what happens

08:43:53.600 --> 08:43:55.600
Have you watched seven cycle path?

08:43:56.160 --> 08:43:59.680
Movie before no, I haven't I'm not sure what that is that gosling

08:44:00.400 --> 08:44:02.400
literally

08:44:03.920 --> 08:44:05.920
Can't wait to see us all together again

08:44:06.560 --> 08:44:11.600
Can't wait as well. We've got our first group collab and then we've got our one-on-one collabs coming out soon tm

08:44:12.560 --> 08:44:18.720
Um, so I'm I'm a see can I please stop burning these lobbies, please?

08:44:32.400 --> 08:44:34.320
Um

08:44:34.320 --> 08:44:40.880
I think you said a little bit before we're a little bit limited on multiplayer games that we can all play together

08:44:41.280 --> 08:44:47.120
So I think I will encourage like some trio collabs or quad man collabs at some point

08:44:48.560 --> 08:44:50.560
and

08:44:51.040 --> 08:44:53.040
But uh

08:44:54.720 --> 08:44:57.520
It'll be fun to see everyone's like dynamically with each other

08:44:58.720 --> 08:45:00.720
I hope no one's scared of me

08:45:00.880 --> 08:45:02.880
Stranny smells. How dare you

08:45:03.920 --> 08:45:07.600
How do your accusations? I smell like burnt lobster

08:45:08.160 --> 08:45:10.160
burnt shrimp burnt trout

08:45:10.560 --> 08:45:12.560
burnt salmon burnt pike

08:45:13.120 --> 08:45:17.440
I smell like burnt everything because I can't stop freaking messing up

08:45:17.840 --> 08:45:21.040
I need to kick 13 lobsters in the snatch and I level up

08:45:21.600 --> 08:45:25.040
And I burn three in a row. Of course when I say that four in a row

08:45:27.200 --> 08:45:29.200
That's more like it

08:45:29.680 --> 08:45:31.680
Trying to upset me video game

08:45:32.480 --> 08:45:34.480
working

08:45:34.560 --> 08:45:36.560
I saw the fish she's handling

08:45:36.800 --> 08:45:38.800
I

08:45:39.120 --> 08:45:44.160
Looking forward to main crash shenanigans. Yeah, that's in july july shenanigans

08:45:46.320 --> 08:45:48.320
I'm not beating the burning

08:45:48.480 --> 08:45:55.360
Eating strong. He's burnt food same way up. Oh, no, those are carcinogenic. You're not supposed to eat burnt any kind of food

08:45:57.360 --> 08:46:03.600
Wait, why did she smell like fish? We're the ones who question. Oh, we did it. We're 50

08:46:06.640 --> 08:46:14.800
We actually did it. No way mercy's up in 10. Oh, no, we got 50. That's insane. Thank you so much. Really crap

08:46:18.800 --> 08:46:20.800
50

08:46:21.040 --> 08:46:23.040
Wow

08:46:23.280 --> 08:46:27.440
And that was like messing about questing as well and all that

08:46:28.000 --> 08:46:30.000
I

08:46:31.840 --> 08:46:37.360
Look forward to less burning and maybe so congrats on his food

08:46:38.560 --> 08:46:45.840
I hope I'll stop burning. Oh my god. I'm so MLG pro at cooking fish

08:46:51.680 --> 08:46:53.680
I'll send the cringe

08:46:54.400 --> 08:46:57.760
It says the values 2.3k for that batch of lobsters

08:46:59.840 --> 08:47:01.840
I thought lobsters were a money maker

08:47:06.000 --> 08:47:09.840
Okay, well, I hope see you play old school again. Yeah, um, we're playing it

08:47:11.040 --> 08:47:15.840
We'll play it once next week on week two and then we'll play it twice on week three

08:47:17.040 --> 08:47:22.960
Um during the week, but I'll split it up just in case because I know that runescape isn't the most interesting

08:47:23.840 --> 08:47:25.840
Not anymore with all the bots

08:47:28.080 --> 08:47:30.400
Maybe the bots aren't so bad after all

08:47:31.040 --> 08:47:33.680
Controversy you can't say that you can't say that

08:47:36.000 --> 08:47:40.720
They wear a really long time ago. I'm wondering if that's one remember like I used to think they're so expensive

08:47:41.680 --> 08:47:43.680
Bots keep the lobsters cheap

08:47:44.080 --> 08:47:46.160
I'm wondering

08:47:46.160 --> 08:47:49.120
like how the economy in runescape would look if

08:47:50.000 --> 08:47:51.440
bots

08:47:51.440 --> 08:47:56.400
Were like completely forbidden like if they managed to like completely eradicate them

08:47:57.920 --> 08:48:01.680
I'm wondering if it would be an uproar because everything would get so expensive

08:48:02.560 --> 08:48:04.560
You know

08:48:05.280 --> 08:48:07.280
Curious curious

08:48:12.720 --> 08:48:14.720
We're learning we're learning

08:48:15.680 --> 08:48:20.160
Stony iron man win. Oh good luck with that. Are you joking?

08:48:21.280 --> 08:48:26.320
Isn't it's hardcore iron man. You can't use buying iron man is war

08:48:27.840 --> 08:48:29.840
You lose everything when you perish

08:48:32.160 --> 08:48:34.160
Sorry

08:48:40.720 --> 08:48:42.720
I feel like it would probably like

08:48:43.200 --> 08:48:46.800
Been working on a mech and ac6 for whatever you get on that

08:48:49.680 --> 08:48:52.880
Ultimate iron man no bank hardcore lose stats when that yeah

08:48:56.080 --> 08:49:01.760
Are you serious? Do you know how much money I've made today? That's 20 million

08:49:02.880 --> 08:49:05.860
No way. I've been given 20 million

08:49:09.520 --> 08:49:11.520
Hello

08:49:12.320 --> 08:49:16.400

08:50:26.880 --> 08:50:29.280
I'm just stunning on the bank because I'm really scared

08:50:30.320 --> 08:50:33.920
I didn't even know there was a freaking thing up there. Well, now I know there's a bank up there

08:50:34.080 --> 08:50:36.080
I am expanding my runescape knowledge

08:50:37.360 --> 08:50:39.360
Wow, okay. Okay, we're here

08:50:40.240 --> 08:50:42.240
I think I might need to

08:50:44.880 --> 08:50:49.200
Can I get level 51? Whoa, wait a minute. Can I even cook these?

08:50:51.680 --> 08:50:53.680
Can I cook surface?

08:50:56.400 --> 08:50:58.400
I can what did they get all burnt out?

08:51:00.160 --> 08:51:02.160
140

08:51:04.160 --> 08:51:07.680
It says I have to cook 56 swordfish to already level up again

08:51:08.720 --> 08:51:14.720
Wait, it's taking down two. It's just 50. It's literally going down by two 48

08:51:16.400 --> 08:51:18.400

Is that a chef? It is it's a golden chef hat and a golden apron a reefling literally gave me it

08:51:34.480 --> 08:51:36.480
Just I doing something

08:51:37.920 --> 08:51:42.080
You should be able to buy enough materials for nine and cooking with five million coins alone

08:51:42.720 --> 08:51:47.200
I've got well, I've got 20 we might as well go flinching while we're at it. Will we do crafting?

08:51:49.040 --> 08:51:52.720
She's not me becoming a runescape player overnight

08:51:54.960 --> 08:51:56.960
Like a runescape skillar, sorry

08:51:57.520 --> 08:52:05.200
Oh my goodness that swordfish isn't seen we're at 31. Yeah, it's like recalculating as you guys say

08:52:05.840 --> 08:52:07.840
It's trying to do the math, but

08:52:08.960 --> 08:52:10.960
That's insane

08:52:12.080 --> 08:52:16.080
How much is it on the ground for swordfish it's 4k for that lot

08:52:16.720 --> 08:52:18.720
It seems like a shame that I'm kind of wasting that but

08:52:20.000 --> 08:52:21.600
Oh

08:52:21.600 --> 08:52:23.120
Even more

08:52:23.120 --> 08:52:25.120
Goodbye those who have to go

08:52:25.440 --> 08:52:27.600
Yes, please don't worry if you have to go now

08:52:27.680 --> 08:52:34.800
I'm about to raid in some mercy to give myself a vocal rest before I do ASMR. I believe it's tomorrow

08:52:35.680 --> 08:52:37.680
And then it's the sweet stream

08:52:37.840 --> 08:52:42.720
Yes, um, so please don't worry if you have to go. Um, I'm literally just cooking away

08:52:43.680 --> 08:52:46.560
Um an experience in swordfish xp

08:52:47.600 --> 08:52:49.600
I sent for scottish anime women

08:52:49.600 --> 08:52:54.800

08:57:26.160 --> 08:57:28.160

This woman needs to rest her voice don't encourage her bad habits lmao

08:57:34.880 --> 08:57:38.240
Right, let me make sure I'm redirecting into the stream

08:57:38.880 --> 08:57:41.840
No, I'm going to make the big boy decision

08:57:42.720 --> 08:57:47.040
And rest my voice as much as it pains me

08:57:48.720 --> 08:57:53.040
Because I do want to lobster. Sorry. I want a swordfish max

08:57:54.160 --> 08:57:56.160
Right, let's do

08:57:56.640 --> 08:57:58.640

08:58:07.680 --> 08:58:11.120
She's still loading in the loading screen so I can stall

08:58:13.600 --> 08:58:15.600
They'll never know

08:58:15.760 --> 08:58:22.000

08:58:30.720 --> 08:58:32.720
Just one more inventory though

08:58:32.720 --> 08:58:36.800
We'll see how much xp we can get. It'll be beautiful. I mean we'll be so close to 52

08:58:43.120 --> 08:58:47.280
Are you gonna do the m&m goodbye? What's the m&m goodbye?

08:58:50.720 --> 08:58:53.760
Oh, you're in Scottish M&M again M&M again

08:58:53.760 --> 08:58:55.760

Let's do it. Let's do it

08:59:09.760 --> 08:59:16.400
What's the m&m thing? A lot of burnt one. Look. I'm trying my best. Okay. It's hard to cook over the fire

08:59:16.880 --> 08:59:21.840
There's so the wind keeps blowing in different directions and people keep moving around the fire

08:59:21.840 --> 08:59:25.440
So the air flow isn't really doing it. Don't supply her addiction

08:59:28.560 --> 08:59:35.360
Get rest or anyone that beautiful acts in the top form. Yes. I will warn and say that ASMR streams are

08:59:36.000 --> 08:59:38.000
a lot shorter

08:59:38.400 --> 08:59:43.680
Um, but I'll definitely be looking at marshmallows. I'll definitely be looking at some scripted stuff

08:59:44.000 --> 08:59:49.760
And you can always submit what you want to say as well. I think you can do like a chat command thing

08:59:50.000 --> 08:59:52.560

09:00:35.120 --> 09:00:37.120
We want that

09:00:38.720 --> 09:00:40.720

No way. I'm getting picked. I'm picking a freaking salmon

09:00:52.400 --> 09:00:57.920
You may have to pull it the hypnotize honestly. I'm not addicted. I promise but let's just grab the salmon

09:00:58.320 --> 09:01:04.320
We're like so close to 52. Let's make it 52. All right, and we'll redirect into mersey make it 52

09:01:05.280 --> 09:01:07.280

09:01:08.480 --> 09:01:09.920
Let's cook

09:01:10.000 --> 09:01:14.560
Reeflings are cutting you off. I can't believe I'm having to pick up fish off the floor

09:01:16.160 --> 09:01:18.160
Stop giving

09:01:18.560 --> 09:01:20.560
Stangered gran bloods go up in

09:01:22.720 --> 09:01:26.720
She almost became golem. I was cool and gone. What do you want it?

09:01:27.280 --> 09:01:30.160
But I can't do it because my voice was this loud. It's so hard

09:01:31.680 --> 09:01:33.920
We're almost at level 52

09:01:33.920 --> 09:01:35.920
Oh

09:01:36.400 --> 09:01:38.400
I'm still burning salmon

09:01:40.480 --> 09:01:42.480
Voice folks must heal

09:01:42.800 --> 09:01:44.800
Stop being nice to me. Reeflings

09:01:45.360 --> 09:01:51.920
Stop looking out for me. I can't are you done snowballing me? You doodoo head. That's all that you doodoo head

09:01:52.560 --> 09:01:56.160
Yo, your ball headed is yo, yo, santa

09:01:58.160 --> 09:02:00.160
That's all that

09:02:00.720 --> 09:02:02.960
I can go offline whenever I want. Okay

09:02:04.880 --> 09:02:08.480
Will you expect brief will you accept briefings instead of fish?

09:02:10.000 --> 09:02:12.240
It depends what am I allowed to do with you, huh?

09:02:13.680 --> 09:02:15.680
Do you offer me some experience?

09:02:19.520 --> 09:02:23.280
Right we're so close to 52 we're so close we're too close

09:02:27.120 --> 09:02:32.080
How much exp is a reefing room? It depends that I get your boy cherry or not

09:02:32.480 --> 09:02:37.760
I have much exit. Yeah, try cooking one. Oh, they're not dropping any

09:02:38.800 --> 09:02:40.800
There's no fish on the floor to cook

09:02:43.760 --> 09:02:48.640
I have a pump in the ground who got to pump it up. You got to know there's no fish on the ground

09:02:48.640 --> 09:02:50.640
I can't even brand up to 52

09:02:51.440 --> 09:02:54.480
If you're close you can start next stream on a good note of leveling up

09:02:55.280 --> 09:03:01.360
I'm not addicted reefing. Just give me the sword fish. Look. Come on. Let's go to the bank together

09:03:01.600 --> 09:03:06.080
Look, we're going to the bank. I just need one more batch of swordfish

09:03:07.600 --> 09:03:09.600
Give me the swordfish

09:03:09.680 --> 09:03:12.080
Look, we're literally bank maxing right now

Come to the bank in edgeville. I'll take you to edgeville. Look. Here's the bank. It's so pretty

09:03:18.880 --> 09:03:20.880
Just one more batch of swordfish

09:03:27.040 --> 09:03:30.960
I I'll do it myself. Where's the banker?

09:03:31.680 --> 09:03:37.840
I'll do it myself because because some other reeflings were kind enough to give me all the salmon

09:03:38.080 --> 09:03:45.040
I'm taking this salmon. I'm taking it away. Stinky reeflings not giving not feeding my fish addiction

09:03:46.560 --> 09:03:48.960

Oh, I just accidentally opened up a thing. Oh, why did that open up in another browser?

09:03:59.280 --> 09:04:02.240
Where the heck is the fish? Have we gone past it? Oh, no, it's here. Sorry

09:04:19.760 --> 09:04:22.320

There I did it 52

09:04:43.040 --> 09:04:46.640
Yippee, I'll finish my inventory and then I will call it there

09:04:49.760 --> 09:04:53.200
You can literally do this any other day. You have to control your screens

09:04:54.160 --> 09:04:58.480
Okay, I'm going I'm going I'll go rest. I just need to finish the inventory. Okay

09:04:59.600 --> 09:05:02.160
You're lucky. There's no fish down here. I've grabbed something

09:05:04.720 --> 09:05:07.680
Put the fire out don't there's a pair of my fire

09:05:12.480 --> 09:05:17.520
No, wait, what are you gonna give me more? I don't know. I think I need to go and I want to go

09:05:17.760 --> 09:05:19.760
I need a rest of life

Wait, you made me walk all the way to get that salmon when you have freaking in your inventory. Give me it. Give me give me

09:05:31.040 --> 09:05:33.280
No way, no way

09:05:36.800 --> 09:05:38.080
Okay

09:05:38.080 --> 09:05:41.680
As I was saying, I'm not addicted. I just need one more

09:05:43.520 --> 09:05:46.480
I had lots of fun too. It was amazing

09:05:48.480 --> 09:05:54.160
The story how many hours have you been listening to the song? I don't know. It's good like it's nice. I like it

09:05:55.040 --> 09:05:57.040
Mercy's gonna end up reading in the story

09:05:58.240 --> 09:06:03.360
Okay, I won't do anymore. We will read into mercy because that's not fair and we can all watch mercy designers

09:06:03.360 --> 09:06:06.320
I don't know what she's gonna do guys. Just one more level. I swear

09:06:07.840 --> 09:06:10.320
We will play runescape again next week

09:06:10.800 --> 09:06:11.840
Um

09:06:11.840 --> 09:06:16.560
And then on week three we'll play it during the week to give people a chance to work on weekends

09:06:16.560 --> 09:06:18.560
A chance to join in through the day

09:06:19.200 --> 09:06:22.720

09:06:26.720 --> 09:06:29.440
She's gonna draw you in a swordfish costume at this rate

09:06:30.080 --> 09:06:32.960
I haven't played it in a long time, but it's kind of fun doing the quest with everyone

09:06:32.960 --> 09:06:37.680
Are they today? Oh, I'm so glad you managed to join in on the quest. We'll definitely do quest next time as well

Um, I don't know what the next quest is that's easy as to do

09:06:42.640 --> 09:06:47.280
So Johnny's gonna turn off stream and keep no I want to achieve everything on stream

09:06:47.360 --> 09:06:52.800
Literally not even a bit of fish xp, right as you I'm gonna close the game. Okay

As you guys watch me log out, you're really gonna hear it log out, but how do I log out without I mean

09:06:59.760 --> 09:07:02.320
