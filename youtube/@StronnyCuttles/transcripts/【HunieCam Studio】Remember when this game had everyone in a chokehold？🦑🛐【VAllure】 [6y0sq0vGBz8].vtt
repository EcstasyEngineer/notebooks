well apparently there's a flavour called Isaac Tears which is so awesome, Viallure's

01:50.400 --> 01:56.880
descriptions will get updated soon, there will be tweets made very shortly, what is

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
that?

01:57.880 --> 02:03.760
it is an energy drinks company, but you can also get non-caffeinated beverages as well,

02:03.760 --> 02:14.840
but yeah it's another income source for the girlies and I'm so happy, but yeah that was

02:14.840 --> 02:31.240
my big news that was kind of like lurking around in the background, I got a new short

02:31.240 --> 02:36.000
that got uploaded as well, I'm just reading some of the comments on it, strongy is neurodivergent

02:36.000 --> 02:43.800
if that's true base, at one point screams I'm freaking normal, now you can get a taste

02:43.800 --> 02:48.600
of mummy, I mean after the last run it was obvious you're the final gamer, that's why

02:48.600 --> 02:55.760
they wanted a piece of me, blame the tism, yep blame the tism, but yes I have a new short

02:55.760 --> 03:00.920
if you haven't seen it yet, it's about how the background musics are all about sonic

03:00.920 --> 03:05.240
heroes which actually came in really good timing because we literally just played sonic

03:05.240 --> 03:15.560
heroes, sonic heroes, I will definitely do an endurance, it's some comment, oh I thought

03:15.560 --> 03:21.240
this is about how the veiler company was being made up of lootubers was the exposing, I didn't

03:21.240 --> 03:27.080
know it was going to be about background music plagiarising, my guys not that serious, it's

03:27.080 --> 03:32.560
not called plagiarism, it's called influence, have you heard of influence before? I've

03:32.560 --> 03:38.160
approved the comment anyway but what the fuck it's not actually really exposing the fucking

03:38.160 --> 03:48.120
company what the fuck, I also had an offline tip so thank you spidey for the offline tip,

03:48.640 --> 03:57.560
they put tess for some reason, I don't know why, Mr Beast collab when? Mr, Mr, Mr Beast,

03:57.560 --> 04:02.440
oh but speaking of things that are coming up soon, now this one's just coming up for

04:02.440 --> 04:10.440
me and it was you coming up for me, hey let's go we got an update, check it out, I'm poignant

04:10.440 --> 04:15.440
with you, look at your little little, I like how you've already somehow got the nicotine

04:15.440 --> 04:21.560
patch on your head, I'm leaving it because it's true to your design, but check us out

04:21.560 --> 04:28.440
together, we're so cute, so we've got this version that's coming along very quickly,

04:28.440 --> 04:35.040
the artist is working so hard and diligently, that's version one which is like a full, that's

04:35.040 --> 04:41.560
like the line art if you will, and then we've got Colored in Tommy, Colored in Tommy me,

04:41.560 --> 04:49.880
I'm so cute, but we're gonna have like an x-ray shot so I'm about to be able to do the see-through

04:49.880 --> 04:57.920
view of you and my tum tum and then I have some cursed ASMR to record, I actually came up with a

04:57.920 --> 05:03.720
new meme ASMR and it's absolutely horrifying, wait I might be able to find it in my notes because

05:03.720 --> 05:11.240
I wrote it down, Scottish e-girl Miaw is like a cat for money ASMR, I know that sounds really weird

05:11.240 --> 05:20.040
out of context, I have a picture to go with it okay, and it's basically like you're my sugar daddy

05:20.040 --> 05:26.880
but I'm Scottish, so you're like Miaw for me and I'm like I'm not gonna Miaw for you and it's like

05:26.880 --> 05:32.280
do you need the money and I'm like I guess, I'll mention like the steam summer sales which are

05:32.280 --> 05:39.000
finishing today by the way if you haven't picked up any games on steam summer sales do it, and that's

05:39.000 --> 05:47.640

10:16.200 --> 10:22.120
pop from the same devs, yes, I think honey pop is the puzzle one but I didn't want to play the puzzle

10:22.120 --> 10:29.080
one, I wanted to play veal or simulator because originally I was gonna play idle manager but

10:29.080 --> 10:38.040

leafling, inner wit, thanks for everything mome, looking forward to the next 30 years of streams,

10:58.440 --> 11:04.600
would you still watch me if I was a girl streamer, not even a hag, will surpass hag by then,

11:04.600 --> 11:10.680
would you watch me if I was a girl streamer, pretty please, will you watch my running commentary

11:10.680 --> 11:19.720
on our yearly playthrough of camryo and picking up the fruits on one go, asterix love, sure yeah

11:19.720 --> 11:24.280
background music still on, you're absolutely correct leafling, thank goodness you got that

11:24.280 --> 11:31.000
cause I certainly would not have if I didn't read that comment, viral momello, are you squidding me

11:31.000 --> 11:39.560
right now, Scottish gilf let's go, heck yeah, okay let's play it, so this game came out and

11:39.560 --> 11:45.160
everyone was in a freaking chokehold over it, I'm not really sure I'd watch you even if I were one,

11:45.160 --> 11:51.400
okay, what's the point of living without watching mommy play childhood games, I was watching this

11:51.400 --> 11:57.160
then streamer do, are you squidding me right now, like a media share thing, prosdino, ever since

11:57.160 --> 12:03.240
violers debut, I've slept less than, oh well, we might be on the same page, I'm gonna be honest

12:03.240 --> 12:08.200
leafling, but I also feel a lot more energized so it cancels it out, thanks mommy, hi you're welcome,

12:08.200 --> 12:14.920
I had a big sleep, I slept for like seven hours after stream and then I've just slept for, I want

12:14.920 --> 12:24.760
to say five hours there, so I'm gonna slurp my tea, hold on, oh no I've just accepted, the stream's

12:24.760 --> 12:34.520
gonna be, they're limited ads, it's fine, yearly cameo placer, I'd be really down for it, like I

12:34.520 --> 12:39.480
just, I'll eat cameo, I'm sorry, it's like such a good game, you can wrap it up, or wrap it up,

12:40.200 --> 12:46.520
seven hours is a big sleep, well it is in consideration that I had two hours the previous day,

12:47.640 --> 12:56.120
are you squidding me right now, oh soul insert, coming out with the lore, actually I remember

12:56.120 --> 13:02.440
honeycam studio came out with negative reception, because of the different art style and lack of

13:03.000 --> 13:10.360
scenes, I'd buy veal or something, I considered it, I considered producing a vn at one point,

13:10.360 --> 13:15.080
because they're a lot cheaper than the average game, it might officially be the first game I'd

13:15.080 --> 13:21.320
produce, I would not base it after the veal or girls just because you never know what will happen,

13:21.320 --> 13:25.080
you know I might do something catastrophic, although I did say to the girls if I ever do

13:25.080 --> 13:30.120
anything bad take me around back and shoot me, do not ever let me live long enough to become the bad

13:30.120 --> 13:35.400
guy, and they were all giggling, but I don't think they realised how serious that was, I was like

13:35.400 --> 13:41.240
take me out back and shoot me, do not let me be the bad guy, okay, do not ever let me act like

13:42.520 --> 13:46.760
you know the very thing I swore to destroy, don't let me be great, as I said we've got

13:46.760 --> 13:54.040
gamersups codes, our updates will all be updated soon, there'll be graphics added to stream soon,

13:54.040 --> 14:01.080
and there'll be tweets about it as well, they are so kind to getting that organised,

14:02.360 --> 14:06.280
but as always the girls get to keep 100% of what they earned through that code,

14:06.280 --> 14:10.280
veal or don't touch it, go straight to their accounts, they will attest to this because

14:10.280 --> 14:18.120
I'm about to have to get them to sort out their accounts, what are you playing, don't look okay,

14:18.120 --> 14:22.760
don't look, recon crusader, love you goddess, love you replaying,

14:24.600 --> 14:28.920
but yes the girls have gamersups accounts, if you wanted to activate the code right now,

14:28.920 --> 14:33.960
just use the code and then their name, if you literally mersey, we everyone got their first

14:33.960 --> 14:42.920
name, so strony, mersey, azura, emmy, ac, mersey, asad mersey, you're gonna miss him,

14:45.880 --> 14:53.240
ac, emmy, azura, shibi, mersey, strony, oh I'll go everyone, okay, I was like hold on a minute

14:53.240 --> 14:59.080
something, I don't know, sassapress, one month ago I fell in love with you and I predict that for

14:59.080 --> 15:05.160
the foreseeable future I shall be in love with you, here's to many more months mommy, I just added

15:05.160 --> 15:12.840
that myself as a thank you for falling in love, get plapped, get plapped, get plapped,

15:15.880 --> 15:22.840
could you imagine an azura waifu cup, unfortunately I'm not sure how gamersups works,

15:22.840 --> 15:27.000
I will ask permission to see if I'm allowed to discuss certain things but at this moment in time,

15:27.960 --> 15:34.840
I'm a good girl, gamersups pog, so if you ever wanted to try gamersups, I'm actually gonna make a

15:34.840 --> 15:42.680
handcam ASMR video about them because they are very kind and they're willing to send out PR packages

15:42.680 --> 15:48.920
so I get to ASMR muck about with their products, so that'll be fun, zero thank you for the one

15:48.920 --> 15:54.360
month, love you mommy, congrats on everything on this one month, can't wait to spend more time with

15:54.520 --> 16:01.560
you, let's go! Just so you know, aside from the main theme, all four teams from Sonic Heroes

16:01.560 --> 16:08.440
have a theme song, we can for Team Sonic, this machine for Team Dark, follow me for Team Rose

16:08.440 --> 16:15.080
and Team Chaotix for Team Chaotix, listen to them all, they're bangers, oh yeah that took me by

16:15.080 --> 16:21.160
surprise when we were playing against Team Rose, my voice is absolutely correct otherwise so thank

16:21.160 --> 16:26.600
you tiny spainy for the tip, yeah I got so surprised, I started hearing, I was like lyrics

16:26.600 --> 16:33.480
and songs in this game, I wonder what mommy's flavor would be, probably pish, no no one's gonna

16:33.480 --> 16:44.920
buy pish, um we will play every team so listen to everything, yes I will ask, um, gamersups what

16:44.920 --> 16:51.080
kind of insider stuff I can mention because it's nothing to do with me so for once I can't even

16:51.080 --> 16:57.720
be transparent, something behavior, hey thank you zero, I don't actually think I said your name when

16:57.720 --> 17:07.400
I said that, peeler flavor, I mean, I mean, Chaotix theme is the banger, I see an enemy would have

17:07.400 --> 17:13.800
a pish, right okay, user done, let me finish this team, we'll get into this game, um so this is

17:13.880 --> 17:23.160
Honey Cam Studios, this is a, uh, simulator strategy building game, I am so bad at identifying

17:23.160 --> 17:30.600
game types, I'm not even kidding, I am absolutely rotten at it, it's fucking mean, I have absolutely

17:30.600 --> 17:34.920
no idea how to categorize games, I mean you guys were literally telling me what, oh I've already

17:34.920 --> 17:43.240
forgotten the name, the type roguelike and roguelike are like two different things, it's a tycoon

17:44.200 --> 17:50.920
a management sim, okay, okay, yeah, for some reason I need to do like a video essay on

17:50.920 --> 18:01.160
categorizations of gaming's because I'm just absolutely awful, gamer slob sex vealer is the

18:01.160 --> 18:05.720
only way to pheromone max taken out, this is literally a game of you running a virtual version of

18:06.440 --> 18:15.480
Exactly, is this game about us? Okay, now I remember when this game had a choke

18:15.480 --> 18:22.040
haul on everyone, choke hold on everyone, but I never played it because I was very young when

18:22.040 --> 18:28.360
it came out and I was still at the mercy of like asking my mum to buy me games, smile, because steam

18:28.360 --> 18:35.960
games and I never really had the money for it and just call it drinking, eat me, I'm in

18:35.960 --> 18:44.360
the strong need to put me in a choke hold on, honeycam falls under the sim, simulation

18:44.360 --> 18:53.240
and management categories not to be confused, stimulation, get it, yep, yeah you get it, okay,

18:53.960 --> 18:57.560
I'm sure you want to start a new fair, let's go, yeah, there I am,

19:03.160 --> 19:04.360
hold on, let me pop this

19:08.680 --> 19:15.320
yeah vealer did exist, finally it took a year but we got here in the end, is this loading now?

19:15.640 --> 19:22.040
show up even later next time, that'd be sweet, that'd be sweet, I love her already,

19:23.960 --> 19:27.800
I chuckled at someone, yeah damn straight you did, that's because you're delirious you're laughing

19:27.800 --> 19:33.560
at my jokes, why did she sound like Emmy, a little loader, hold on can I, oh I have just

19:37.080 --> 19:42.440
how'd that make it go big again, is it control shift or something, no I'm skipping the dialogue,

19:42.440 --> 19:47.080
I accidentally made it not full screen, oh for fuck's sake, how did I keep doing this,

19:48.360 --> 19:53.960
hold on this is terrible, how did I make it big, help me make it big, roof laying please,

19:53.960 --> 19:58.840
how did I make it big again, I accidentally minimized it but it's like locked and it won't make me

19:58.840 --> 20:12.120
let it go big, all enter, no, what are you doing video game, can I stretch it without it being

20:13.000 --> 20:22.920
stretched, okay, that's just gonna have to do this, oh stop it, I mean let's keep it 100 here,

20:22.920 --> 20:26.600
this is the closest you're gonna, I will edit the sentence once we get in here,

20:26.600 --> 20:31.000

My god, sorry this game seems so polished

26:55.520 --> 26:58.960
Buildings can have three girls receive cash Wow

27:03.600 --> 27:08.280

28:47.160 --> 28:49.160
Okay

28:53.800 --> 29:00.840
Oh my gosh, this is so good. Sorry. I must say this this game is good. This is polished

29:10.600 --> 29:12.600
Okay

29:14.760 --> 29:16.760
An accessory

29:18.280 --> 29:22.360
Cash flow from operations. Don't worry. This is the only in the game. Okay

29:23.240 --> 29:25.240
What is that wage? What's she talking about?

29:26.360 --> 29:28.600
Right. Wait, hold on. I'm just gonna do this right now

29:31.720 --> 29:34.520
I think everything's like good volume levels now

29:36.600 --> 29:38.600
I'll just leave it like that

29:40.120 --> 29:43.000
I mean, there's no reason to make a bad game only

29:44.600 --> 29:47.400
That sounded a bit better a bit less intense on the music

29:47.880 --> 29:49.880
Um

29:52.120 --> 29:58.600
Honey knows how to make games have they made anything recently? I was aware of what honey pop is but this game. I'm loving it

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Okay

30:05.400 --> 30:07.400
Yes

30:09.880 --> 30:11.880
Okay

30:12.520 --> 30:14.520
Oh, I love this

30:15.080 --> 30:17.080
Uh-huh

30:17.800 --> 30:22.840
The higher her style level is the more fans she will attract right kiana's back will hire kiana

30:23.560 --> 30:27.800
But higher talent and style levels do come at a cost and she will usually demand a higher

30:28.040 --> 30:33.960
A kiana retry and she said I need a pay for this wien. Okay. Both the honey pop one and two were well put together

30:34.440 --> 30:36.440
I wonder if they're doing anything new

30:36.760 --> 30:39.720
To take her on board before you go off hiring a total babe

30:40.600 --> 30:42.600
A total babe

30:42.600 --> 30:46.920
You can hover over the music note and little bow icon little bow icon

30:47.240 --> 30:52.600
This fan count here is how many of our existing fans would be interested in her based on her fetishes

30:54.280 --> 30:56.760
Okay, so we've got latina and

30:58.760 --> 31:03.400
We're gonna recruit because she never drinks or smokes, which is really good

31:03.960 --> 31:06.200
But these both frequent smokers

31:07.560 --> 31:09.560
Although she's very good though

31:10.280 --> 31:12.280
No, I

31:12.840 --> 31:14.840
Sweet

31:15.240 --> 31:21.480
I'll do my best. Uh, right. Should we work on getting what fans like this?

31:24.440 --> 31:27.480
I feel like it's like more worth it to get fans

31:29.160 --> 31:31.160
And then send them off

31:32.360 --> 31:36.760
Are we doing speedrun tactics? Right now we're gonna do show

31:36.840 --> 31:38.840
Oh

31:40.280 --> 31:43.080
I don't uh, I need more money

31:45.720 --> 31:50.520
Am I doing correct? I don't know if I'm doing correct right now. I have no idea

31:53.400 --> 31:57.560
Uh, right. What is in this? Oh, we can have a third girl already

31:58.600 --> 32:01.640
Receive two plus cash each time you collect from this. Sure

32:02.440 --> 32:07.000
Automation all locations will all collect resources once every 15 minutes

32:08.520 --> 32:10.520
Ads are I've not got ads unlocked yet

32:10.520 --> 32:14.280
It says promo but it's like hidden out imagine if I just recruited all the girls from the first game

32:14.440 --> 32:17.160
Why is the building wobbling right now? What is this?

32:17.640 --> 32:21.080
Hardware camera quality up web server streaming quality up

32:21.640 --> 32:26.040
Receive two plus fans each time you collect from the photo studio or that might be a big kind of boost

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Buildings can have three girls at once

32:29.800 --> 32:33.240
Uh, right. We are gonna send you to get me someone

32:35.560 --> 32:37.800
And then we're gonna put her in there

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
And collect more money

32:44.200 --> 32:47.080
How do they relax though, I have no idea

32:48.600 --> 32:50.600
Right, we're getting a new girl

32:50.680 --> 32:52.680
Oh

32:54.200 --> 32:57.880
Sarah a guy who oh my god, it's sugar

33:00.200 --> 33:04.840
Uh, frequently smokes and drink. See the she says never on both

33:05.800 --> 33:09.560
I'm tempted. Nikki is a shy nerd girl who started out streaming video games

33:09.560 --> 33:13.240
But quickly realized how much more money she could make by showing off the kids

33:13.880 --> 33:18.040
Zoe's an insufferable millennial who tries a little too hard to be unique. She

33:18.280 --> 33:20.280
Mm-hmm as

33:20.440 --> 33:21.400
Wait

33:21.400 --> 33:26.520
They unironically did the helip. What's that helicopter Apache meme

33:27.480 --> 33:31.720
Sarah is an unbearable weeaboo who thinks she's Japanese and calls herself suki

33:31.800 --> 33:37.320
She's the worst, but they're still kind of hot and weird. That is hilarious. This game is insane

33:37.880 --> 33:39.880
That is hull

33:40.680 --> 33:42.680
No

33:42.680 --> 33:44.920
We have a few girls. It's time to think about training

33:46.760 --> 33:51.720
Being naked on the internet isn't as easy as it sounds you gotta put some effort into that shit

33:52.600 --> 33:56.440
If you drop a girl off your strip club, she can dance to earn talent point

33:57.320 --> 34:03.000
Okay, and if you bring a girl over here to the fashion boutique, she'll earn style points by shopping

34:04.760 --> 34:06.760
Okay

34:07.240 --> 34:09.960
Her talent or style level will go up respectively

34:10.920 --> 34:17.080
Just remember the higher a girl's talent and style level are the higher her hourly rate will be uh-huh

34:19.240 --> 34:26.120
Okay, hold on all locations all collect let's do that receive test. I'm not sure about

34:27.720 --> 34:29.720

34:29.800 --> 34:35.080
So do we just I don't know what the carry item is. I don't even know where to get an item

34:36.280 --> 34:38.280
We'll do give it a shot

34:38.600 --> 34:40.600
Uh

34:42.520 --> 34:44.520
I'm just farming

34:45.800 --> 34:47.800
I'm not sure how to do this

34:52.760 --> 34:57.320
Is this this is about modeling. Hey, yes 100 right 21st style point

35:00.920 --> 35:02.920

35:17.320 --> 35:19.320
I love that

35:33.400 --> 35:35.400
Okay

35:38.520 --> 35:41.000
I'm loving this right what's going on here

35:42.200 --> 35:46.360
Three plus cash when you collect carry an action. Let's do the item thing

35:47.720 --> 35:49.720
Because it told me to do the item thing

35:50.360 --> 35:54.360
Remember to check how you need to pay them before midnight midnight. Oops me who just spent my Steve

35:58.840 --> 36:00.840
No, this is

36:09.240 --> 36:11.240
Okay, okay, okay

36:13.880 --> 36:15.880
Is that what I think is

36:28.840 --> 36:31.400
No way it's got sugar

36:31.880 --> 36:41.000
They really said we've got a Colombian and they gave us the sugar

36:45.320 --> 36:48.920
All activities will be done twice as fast I mean shit

36:51.800 --> 36:54.280
Okay, let's get some money

36:57.480 --> 36:59.480
Money money money

37:01.640 --> 37:03.640
I don't know how to

All right, hold on

37:06.920 --> 37:10.920
Right go go go. Sure. Why not?

37:12.840 --> 37:14.840
Uh, yeah

37:19.000 --> 37:21.560
Oh, whoa, we just made the money

37:23.240 --> 37:29.320
Right, what do we need to do next? It elapsed two minutes each time you click to rush an activity

37:31.800 --> 37:37.560
Elapsed two minutes. It's like good or bad. All occasions will all collect in just a minute

37:39.560 --> 37:41.560
Receive talent

37:41.880 --> 37:42.920
talent

37:42.920 --> 37:49.880
Receive community each time you click. I think this one's the best one to go next camera quality up fans earned from increase

37:49.960 --> 37:57.000
Okay, that's good and that's good. So what 150 to get community hardware and web servers and then think we'll start doing staffing again

37:58.200 --> 38:00.200
Clicking dreams of time

38:01.480 --> 38:06.040
How'd I do and I completely forgot what I was supposed to do

38:09.720 --> 38:15.160
Yeah, yeah, I love that. Yeah. Yeah, right everyone make money make money

38:16.440 --> 38:18.440

38:21.080 --> 38:24.760

38:47.560 --> 38:49.560
Wait, why can't I not go?

38:50.680 --> 38:53.000
Oh, you're too stressed out drats. Okay

Okay, she's stressed so where you go

40:43.560 --> 40:48.040
Oh, we can invest in a 50 already. Um, all locations will collect receive

40:48.600 --> 40:52.920
Do do the fans and then do capacity then do automation. I think

40:56.360 --> 40:59.560
Completely suppresses the urge to drink that sounds OP

41:03.160 --> 41:05.160
Um

41:05.320 --> 41:08.760
Completely suppresses the urge to smoke. I'm gonna get that

41:11.880 --> 41:13.080
So

41:13.080 --> 41:17.800
When we hire the next girl we will add it to whoever's needs to smoke

41:18.680 --> 41:20.680
Because that sounds really good

41:21.640 --> 41:25.000
Okay invest 58 buildings can have three girls at once. Good

41:27.480 --> 41:29.480
It is uh

41:30.680 --> 41:33.560
The nicotine patch it's us mommy. Yes, little reef one

41:36.120 --> 41:38.120
I'm on it. Okay

41:38.200 --> 41:44.680
Locations. Oh, do their thing. Okay. Next. Let's go into staffing and we'll hire more girls. Let's go

41:46.600 --> 41:51.240
Now that three people can be in a studio at once we shall do that

41:52.120 --> 41:53.400
And

41:53.400 --> 41:58.120
Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed. But you I need you

42:00.520 --> 42:02.760
Can we invest no 91

42:03.320 --> 42:09.560
100 straw knee is not just the working girl. But as to would you guys let me pimp you out?

42:11.720 --> 42:14.680
What is that notification say it's fresh out of what?

42:18.200 --> 42:24.200
Oh, no, it's about to be midnight. I'm about to go into debt. I think so if I invest right now, I'm about to go into debt

42:24.760 --> 42:26.760
Uh

42:30.200 --> 42:35.640
Let's show we've not really upgraded the fact your bucket. I like living life on the edge. What are you gonna?

42:38.440 --> 42:41.640
Let's say very quickly make some money

42:47.960 --> 42:49.960
Wait, am I gonna die?

42:54.280 --> 42:58.920
No, no, no, we're gonna be fine. It's nothing personal. It's just business, baby

42:59.400 --> 43:05.640
Nothing gets in between me and my money. Yes. Yes. Yes. Don't worry about it. Uh, we'll be fine. We'll be fine

43:07.560 --> 43:09.560
Uh

43:10.360 --> 43:15.400
No, the wrong one draft. I meant to put them in here because we need to hire a new girl

43:18.360 --> 43:21.240
We need to put one of them in the recruitment

43:22.200 --> 43:24.200
Sorry, I'm dumb

43:27.400 --> 43:30.280
Excuse me, I like the music. I can read that out, right

43:31.720 --> 43:33.720
Oh she be

43:33.960 --> 43:35.960
fashion Aaron style points

43:36.680 --> 43:38.680
each talent

43:39.880 --> 43:46.280
No, okay, we'll do the wine box. So then it doesn't matter who we get from the model agency. We can put items on them

43:46.840 --> 43:50.440
Um, right, let's focus on making some money

43:52.200 --> 43:55.000
Because I don't want to lose my first run because I suck

43:57.080 --> 44:00.280
Yeah, it's a thing. What are the books 13 bucks?

44:05.640 --> 44:08.280
You need to go again for me. We need to get the money

44:09.800 --> 44:12.040
Right, you did fantastic

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
It's literally me right now though for real for real

44:18.360 --> 44:21.800
She'll only demand half as much pay. Oh my god

44:22.760 --> 44:28.840
I'd I want to go all out on the wine boxes. Right go mix her. She kind of needs fans though

44:32.440 --> 44:36.520
Because she is not right like, who are we going?

44:36.520 --> 44:38.520
I

44:38.840 --> 44:42.440
Whoa 13 hours, but she's like way up here

44:43.560 --> 44:51.560
Ico Ico is looking for a way to fill her days after recently been fired from her job as a university professor for misconduct

44:52.680 --> 44:54.680
Lailani

44:54.760 --> 45:00.520
Moved from the pacific to get away from her strict family and lives by the by her rules. She acts shy, but she knows what she's doing

45:01.480 --> 45:03.240
Pardon me. I just burped

45:03.240 --> 45:05.240
I'm gonna get Ico

45:05.560 --> 45:09.640
And then I'm gonna shove all of the stuff on her

45:12.280 --> 45:14.280
Uh

45:14.280 --> 45:19.880
How do I uh, how do I put items on her? Oh, no, they can only hold one item

45:20.680 --> 45:22.680
How do I put an item on you?

45:24.280 --> 45:26.280
Hold on

45:26.760 --> 45:28.760
Wait, what was her addiction?

45:29.160 --> 45:32.520
Addicted to drinks. Okay. Wait, hold on. Hold on. I've got give me

45:33.480 --> 45:38.600
Okay, so she's not addicted to drinking but she'll smoke a little bit

45:40.680 --> 45:44.680
Uh, okay. Okay. If we can do this the wine box would be perfect in your book

45:44.920 --> 45:46.120
Wait, honey

45:46.120 --> 45:51.080
Cam has the girls from honey tuna. Take Ico the uchi Asian from the game. Ico is a dub

45:52.520 --> 45:55.720
Sarah has a huge huge fan count. Yes, I can do that

45:56.680 --> 45:58.680
Uh, let's

45:59.400 --> 46:01.400
Talent

46:02.600 --> 46:07.160
Does he need talent or am I being crazy? Wait, what did you

46:10.360 --> 46:13.800
What is uh, forgotten what this does Aaron's point cash will

46:16.040 --> 46:19.480
Aaron's more fans per oh, I think it's better to do the cash

46:21.960 --> 46:23.960
Yeah, we're gonna need some money

46:25.400 --> 46:26.200
Yes

46:26.200 --> 46:31.400
Go you're too stressed out. Of course you are. That's completely normal because you can't be a robot

46:32.120 --> 46:34.120
That's fine

46:34.520 --> 46:37.640
Right, you do not make as much as she she makes 34 per

46:38.840 --> 46:40.840
Session if you will

46:41.800 --> 46:45.800
Right, what's the next upgrade so receive five plus cash

46:48.040 --> 46:50.040
Oh, these are 500 though

46:53.480 --> 46:59.960
I mean it implies that this one productivity and accounting are that you are in debt. You still need to pay them to drive

47:00.920 --> 47:10.280
Okay, okay, I'm working on it. I'm working on it. How do I get more smokes? She's just going to singy

47:14.600 --> 47:16.600
Okay

47:16.840 --> 47:21.480
I am trying so hard level. Okay, so it puts them up

47:24.440 --> 47:26.440
52 cash though

47:27.400 --> 47:29.400
Oh every time she pops in

47:32.520 --> 47:38.600
Yeah, that other one does not really make me much money. I wish I had displayed their names. What's your name?

47:40.200 --> 47:42.840
What's your name? Nikki Nikki with the blue hair

47:45.880 --> 47:49.880
Tiffany is free. I may send her to get a new item

47:51.640 --> 47:56.040
Because the girls that don't get stressed don't actually have any bonus items on them

47:56.520 --> 48:00.520
Not too bad. Nikki's too stressed out. That's okay. You're allowed to be stressed

48:01.320 --> 48:03.320
Nikki's gonna need your pops and

48:04.520 --> 48:06.040
He's a cake

48:06.040 --> 48:08.600
Uh, Keanu's too stressed out as well

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Oh

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I am gonna try and

48:15.320 --> 48:21.720
Just max out money because we're about to have to pay at midnight. We're at 8 30. So I'm playing it safe

48:22.840 --> 48:25.400
We will just do the midnight thing

48:27.400 --> 48:29.960
Sure, I'm just gonna go all out of money for her

48:33.000 --> 48:36.680
Almost yeah, because there's currently unless we speed this up a bit

48:38.280 --> 48:41.640
Oh, and I can get them back and then there can be more than one

48:43.400 --> 48:46.760
Oh, please get to work minus theory again

48:50.280 --> 48:52.440
Fans earned from a photo shoot increase

48:56.440 --> 48:58.440
Wait, these are all full shit related

49:02.840 --> 49:06.120
Should I just do nicotine patch? No

49:11.800 --> 49:13.800
Uh

49:14.760 --> 49:22.440
Sure, let's get this one for no particular reason at all. Hey, Tiffany for no particular reason at all. Here you go

49:23.400 --> 49:25.080
Oh

49:25.080 --> 49:27.080
Wow

49:27.080 --> 49:31.400
Oh, Nikki just does not make me any money. She really doesn't

49:33.240 --> 49:38.520
We're at maximum capacity. Oh god, this game's harder than I thought. Am I gonna lose?

49:40.200 --> 49:43.640
For no particular reason, right? Let's just get her more fans then

49:45.800 --> 49:47.800
Are you gonna be stressed out?

49:48.200 --> 49:50.200
Uh, I feel like yeah, but

49:51.160 --> 49:57.560
What do I kind of want to get the one we're more oh, it's 500 bucks right do 100 bucks investment

49:58.360 --> 50:00.360
as soon as we can

50:00.360 --> 50:02.360
because we're struggling

50:02.840 --> 50:10.360
Nikki you are not going to be doing shows you do not make the same kind of money maximum capacity wait wait until she gets out

50:11.400 --> 50:13.400
You go make fans you do that

50:14.760 --> 50:16.760
This is getting rough

50:17.720 --> 50:19.720
Right 100 bucks. We're almost there

50:20.440 --> 50:22.920
I hope the rest of the girls are not watching this right now

50:23.720 --> 50:29.560
Me and August like that's it. Everyone do this do this. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out

50:32.520 --> 50:34.520
Uh good, can you like

50:36.120 --> 50:42.280
Get slightly better at anything. I don't mean to be nasty. Nikki, but you are struggling right now

50:43.720 --> 50:45.720
To do anything

50:47.720 --> 50:49.720
Okay, we've got 100 bucks

50:50.760 --> 50:52.760
Accounting receive extra cash

50:53.160 --> 50:59.240
That's two minutes when we rush. So we're gonna do that one next because apparently we're like rushing through the entire day by accident

51:01.160 --> 51:06.360
57 cash, okay, that's good. You can go get a new item to give to the girls

51:07.880 --> 51:09.880
Oh wait, I accidentally put

51:10.280 --> 51:12.280
The boutique all right

51:12.360 --> 51:14.360
I'm not a girl, but I will get out

51:14.760 --> 51:19.720
Strongly working everyone to the bone. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Am I supposed to manage their stress?

51:19.720 --> 51:21.720
I assume I could just put them all in at the same time

51:24.520 --> 51:26.520
All right, we'll put her to rest

51:26.920 --> 51:28.920
Nikki's now level two

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine

51:34.840 --> 51:36.840
Uh

51:37.800 --> 51:40.920
You're going straight back in misses 57

51:43.240 --> 51:46.360
Although we can get another girl if we really want us

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Receive

51:51.560 --> 51:55.480
Streaming quality, uh-huh girls can carry two items. Yes

51:57.000 --> 52:02.520
That's very good because you need a nicotine patch

52:07.160 --> 52:09.160
Yes

52:09.720 --> 52:13.400
Yes, that's what I wanted to do right

52:15.560 --> 52:21.000
Okay, they're both relaxing so I'll skip time on them relaxing because we need to farm money like no

52:27.320 --> 52:33.160
Do we prepare for a new person coming in with nicotine patch and stuff I think we do

52:39.240 --> 52:44.200
I think we just prepare for a new girl coming in with the smoking and drink situation

52:46.120 --> 52:49.560
You're gonna have to go make some cash because you're doing terrible

52:50.120 --> 52:52.120
Strongly now needs a purple coat

52:52.920 --> 52:57.000
I walk with like a pimp. Was it a walk like a

52:57.960 --> 52:59.960
a real og

52:59.960 --> 53:05.720
I don't know what I'm doing. Can you guys make some money? Oh my gosh, please make some money. I am dying

53:05.720 --> 53:08.920
No sweat. We're about to go in the red again

53:10.040 --> 53:14.280
Why am I so bad? I think they need to get more fans, maybe

53:16.680 --> 53:18.680
Maybe

53:19.480 --> 53:23.480
Yeah, sure you did fine. Oh, we are not gonna make the payroll

53:24.600 --> 53:26.600
335 bucks

53:29.000 --> 53:31.240
I don't know if we can invest in another girl

53:31.240 --> 53:33.240
Oh

53:34.920 --> 53:41.400
My gosh, wait, why is this game so hard? I'm doing something wrong. There's something I'm not picking up on

53:42.600 --> 53:46.120
What am I not picking up on earning an extra 10 bucks? That's fine

53:47.800 --> 53:52.040
Stream call a cash earned by 500. Right. Is that what we're going for?

53:52.040 --> 53:54.040
Uh

53:57.160 --> 53:59.160
Needs more

53:59.240 --> 54:04.360
Overlap every time you send them to the adult store their price goes stop. Is that real?

54:05.560 --> 54:09.640
Ico is expensive time to time is going by too fast as well

54:11.320 --> 54:13.320
Should we do the 100 bucks then?

54:15.720 --> 54:17.720
This is hard

54:18.040 --> 54:19.560
I'm trying

54:19.560 --> 54:21.560
right, let's do

54:21.720 --> 54:23.720
Well, she's about to finish right go again

54:26.600 --> 54:28.040
Oh

54:28.040 --> 54:32.520
Yes, go right. She makes 500. Why do you make 57 bucks?

54:33.240 --> 54:35.240
Because you've got talent times two

54:36.680 --> 54:40.520
But then that puts her base price up. I need to give everyone the piggy bank

54:40.920 --> 54:42.440
I'll do it

54:42.440 --> 54:47.000
The price depends on style and talent not many have I think training the girls is more important than money

54:47.000 --> 54:49.960
Think about how well we are allowed to if the girls had zero experience

54:50.920 --> 54:52.920
Honestly

54:53.640 --> 54:55.640
If I 15 fans

54:57.080 --> 54:59.080
But there's no overlap

55:03.560 --> 55:06.200
Uh maxipum capacity

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
I don't know

55:10.600 --> 55:12.840
Does shove everyone into the bit club

55:13.640 --> 55:20.120
I'm trying to get more fans in the categories with that other girl and then if we hire someone

55:21.080 --> 55:26.840
That has like same fan base that would probably help out a lot

55:29.720 --> 55:35.240
She's already pretty talented, I don't know. I'm probably gonna regret putting her in there, but

55:36.200 --> 55:38.200
I

55:39.960 --> 55:42.440
Know you you have hardly the output

55:45.960 --> 55:52.040
God they're inside the studio for so long. I'm definitely missing something 57 cash

55:53.480 --> 55:56.520
I cause less than 30 fans does she? Oh

55:59.080 --> 56:03.720
If we're still in the red by midnight, it's over getting them trained is pretty important

56:03.880 --> 56:06.120
Is it fans are getting them trained like this?

56:08.360 --> 56:10.360
I don't know

56:11.720 --> 56:13.720
I'm trying

56:14.840 --> 56:16.840
Okay, listen

56:17.800 --> 56:20.760
Sure, if you say so right 200 fans

56:22.680 --> 56:28.040
I thought this was gonna be a chill game because literally I looked I was gonna play idol manager

56:28.600 --> 56:31.720
She is she gonna end up making the most money

56:32.040 --> 56:37.160
I was gonna end up playing idol manager, but you guys were like that game's actually super duper hard. Don't do that

56:37.240 --> 56:39.240
So I've not done it

56:40.600 --> 56:43.400
I feel like I'm doing something terribly wrong

56:44.360 --> 56:47.000
Girls can carry a third item for 2.5

56:49.240 --> 56:55.320
We'll do the elapsed time one against my better judgment, but she's about to be stressed out

56:56.280 --> 56:58.440
It's too expensive for your current setup

57:02.760 --> 57:06.840
Well, I guess you're just gonna get more fans

57:09.160 --> 57:11.320
Okay, so Ico hardly has any fans

57:12.760 --> 57:14.280
So

57:14.280 --> 57:16.280
Do you want to go get some?

57:17.000 --> 57:21.080
Okay, we made it to 100 bucks. So we're gonna invest. I know we're gonna go in the red

57:21.960 --> 57:23.720
but

57:23.800 --> 57:25.800
I'm needing help

57:25.880 --> 57:28.840
With this zoom in thing. I need the time to go slower

57:30.680 --> 57:33.080
Should have gone for she was way cheaper

57:38.600 --> 57:43.480
She makes 52 cash now, okay, it is I need to send them into

57:44.600 --> 57:48.440
The thing need to get more fans. That's fine. I can deal with that

57:49.320 --> 57:51.320
Yes, go get more fans

57:52.280 --> 57:55.720
Everyone go get more fans. We're trying we're trying out here. Okay

57:57.320 --> 58:00.920
I know we're gonna go into the negative. We were scaling too early

58:02.120 --> 58:05.160
Okay, everyone go get fans go get more fans go

58:07.320 --> 58:09.320
Okay, you're too stressed out. That's fine

58:23.480 --> 58:25.880
That was the problem. We needed fans. Okay

58:27.160 --> 58:30.440
That was the problem. I didn't optimize

58:31.880 --> 58:33.880
You're too stressed out. That's perfectly fine

58:35.400 --> 58:40.200
Okay, everyone's getting sent to this little photo shoot everyone's getting sent to the photo shoot

58:40.680 --> 58:45.880

But not to against to us

58:59.480 --> 59:01.480
I don't make myself clear

59:01.960 --> 59:07.720
Okay, I think I made myself clear everyone get fans. Okay, you hardly get fans when I send you away though

59:10.280 --> 59:13.960
Oh my god a hundred and are you too stressed? Okay, that's understandable. Have a nice day

59:16.280 --> 59:19.640

59:49.400 --> 59:51.480

59:52.520 --> 59:56.440

Each site caters to a specific fetish. So all the new fans gain from that is hilarious. Oh, that's so good

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.800
Two so we don't have to wait around for fans to trickle in

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:18.840
This is so good for my way. If you invest in advertising, we'll have more promo opportunities every day. Okay

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.760
Okay, I

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.760
I am understanding

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.320
I'm comprehending right everyone go make money the now

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.120
Because we're gonna buy promo

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.480
Yes, we're gonna buy promo if it's free and I don't have to send them. Is this dealer? It absolutely is

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:41.400
I'm trying so hard to hit all the categories. Okay. We've got lollipop on the go. We've got penta

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.240
We've got

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.280
Chocolate right you do 81. Sure. Why not?

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.000

We have we've got another one for

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.240
Teen

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.040
Okay

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.920
Okay, okay, okay. I'm learning. I'm learning right go get more fans

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.520
Right promo. No, wait. I've still not made the money. Wait, hold on. Hold on

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:19.800
Okay, I'm starting to slightly get it right. We don't have any fetish for hot chocolate lover

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.480
Do we have the girls that cater to those? Yes, Tiffany is a

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Oh, she's also banal

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.520
Okay, I'm learning I'm learning

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.400
We're at 45 bucks though

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.640
Ha we're at 45 bucks already

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.000
Hmm should I go all out on money at the moment?

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.840
What would be the next one 250 receive 10 plus cash

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:07.400
Four ads will be available. Sure. I'll put it into ad space because if it gets me if it skips the part where they have to go

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:09.880
Oh, you're too stressed. Sorry

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.360
If it's oh my god, she makes 180 though

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.040
Okay, I think we'll go all out on buying ads

01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.480
And just try and get the money we are going to go into the negative but that's okay

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:33.320
We working on it there we go what we're looking at negative. Oh see only negative 79 today. Okay. Okay. We're getting there

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.560
What does promo look like today?

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.120
uh big booty

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.800
And glasses are the only two that we can utilize right now

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.920
So we have our objective

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.920
Done with that

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.120
Okay, let's invest like that

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.280
Glasses yes, we have two with glasses actually

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320
Okay, okay

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:02.600
so

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600
glasses and that one

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.480
And that's all we can do today

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.720
For investment wise that way

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.840
Sure, we'll get some fancy

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.000
Easy peasy, huh? Oh you're too stressed out. Sorry. Sorry

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.120
Oh, we are like you doing it. I will take your whole stock of ico

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:27.720
We might need to invest in the chub and chocolate for the new gen moment. Okay. Okay. I hear you. I hear you

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.720
Uh, we could maybe do

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.600
You're too stressed out. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed out

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.680
What are we looking at for all locations will all click? No, it's fine. Um

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.440
500

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.160
Cash earned is increased by 50 percent. Okay, we're gonna go all out on that for now

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.040
I think that's the best idea at this point in time

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But we are starting to get a lovely

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.320
Gross

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:07.160
We are starting to do it. It looks like advertisements are way to go but we will invest in a

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.200
Okay, let's hurry up with the spaddy so someone else can get put in as well

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.760
And

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.960
And then

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:27.160
For making money it's fans modified by their talent value time to make them go into the club

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.320
Okay, they have multipliers

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.280
Mmm

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.040
Nice capacity. I'm just telling her like continually get more fans

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:45.800
Because she's upgrading glasses, which I assume cascades on Ico

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.440
I don't really tell her to stream that much

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:59.640
We'll try it. We'll try it. We'll try it. It is going to put up our base price for the girls, but they are doing pretty good right now

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.640
Okay, there we go

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.640
investment go down

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.440
by the cam

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.400
Community you receive three plus

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:21.880
What next is the game maybe accounting is next and then capacity and then I will get a new girl because we're at the point

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.880
Where not everyone is fitting inside

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.480
Sure, why not?

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.920
200 bucks 200 bucks two nine seven

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.760
Two two eight nine you should get more toys

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.480
You would say that wouldn't be a little refling

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:46.520
Oh, we are starting to cascade what Ico though. We're at 300 bucks already. Is there anything we can get?

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.760
We can all right, okay, okay, we're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing it. We're getting there

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.040
It just took me a hot second. Okay

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.920
I'm just very dumb

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:06.360
Now I'm gonna put something on nicky because we keep pushing her

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.680
I don't know how little or

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.840
How much we're gonna go under for debt for the payroll, but we're trying

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.720
That's the main thing

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.920
Are we even gonna go into debt today 700 wait why 700s?

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.400
Why 700

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.440
Why 700

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:45.960
If the girls get those fans has a high talent she'd get more for Ico

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.440
Yeah, I was gonna put something on nicky because nicky's getting glasses

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.240
For her right now, which is really good

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.160
Oh my god, this really is a strategy game

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.280
I thought it was gonna be the easy peasy strategy, but nah, they're going for it

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:06.040
I'll see if I can get a comp. Oh, you're too stressed. That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed. Right. No, not nicotine

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.800
Girls habits improve. She'll only demand half as much pay. Uh, that's really funny

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
No

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.480
All these are temporary

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.880
The piggy bank seems all right though

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.880
Oh

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.120
Right hold on books

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.960
Kiana's actually charging a wee bit

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.160
You can calm down here and that's what's up

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.920
Wait, hold on. Is it girls?

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.160
How do I put a piggy bank on you?

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.800
I've already forgotten how to put the piggy bank on hold on

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.040
You calm down. Thanks. Stop charging me so much. I know Ico doesn't have a free slot yet

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.560
As well as subscriber pillow. Did they get paid while relaxing? What a kind card

01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:00.200
Every ever they stream cost you and you're running some of those girls into the ground

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.920
Oh, she makes 194. Does she make more than the other girl?

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:11.800
I guess because she's making all the fans in her

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.840
Category

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.960
Oh, she only makes 140 now. She's the weak link

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.440
I

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:27.880
Don't want to level her up. You know what go and get another toy

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.520
What's in my inventory I forgot

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.400
Keep forgetting right actually already have a wine box and nicotine patch if I wanted someone new

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:44.520
I think I need piggy bank for Ico

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I think I need piggy bank for Ico

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.360
Wow, that's rough. Ico is killing us right now

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.800
If I can get a piggy bank, I'll have to invest in

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.480
Oh, there's actually a few things we could invest in here

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.640
We don't have the others yet

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:09.080
2.5 for a third item

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:13.960
Ouch

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.960
You are the weakest link goodbye

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.040
Yeah, because she isn't leveling up

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.160
I know but if I level them up they cost even more per hour

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.320
That's currently the problem I'm facing

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:33.320
1.9

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.440
I don't want to level them up, but I think I'm gonna have to

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.280
Go get some more fans while you're at it

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.120
302 cash though

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.480
I like the little heels sound

01:09:56.520 --> 01:10:02.760
Yeah, she's gone up to 14 you're too stressed. That's fine. That's fine. Everyone's too stressed. Everyone's allowed to be stressed. Okay

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.160
Orange stale while shopping in half the time

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.600
Sorry, but it's just cat ears. I don't think cat ears are very I don't think that counts

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.560
um

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.280
Well, we've not done that on someone so

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.640
Who's getting in uh

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.360
sports

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.360
I'll just shovel on here. Okay

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.080
Ah

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.800
That maybe wasn't the best idea but hey ho

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:36.840
Can you switch items? Yes, I assume so

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:42.600
Okay, she's just gone out to 194. So do we farm fans again?

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.120
All right, we don't have that invest what five girls all locations

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.800
I think four girls in a building and then we'll do the staff one

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.840
I say that as if I'm not running us into the ground right now. Go get more fans

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.040
Or maybe I should I should invest in the more fans thing

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760
I don't know what to do

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.000
I'll invest in the more fans thing it will put us in debt, which is fine

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.960
Um

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.680
Imagine if we just hoarded piggy banks and gave them all to the girls. I'm needing to shove one on ickel

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:28.680
But I'm like hardly getting the cash

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.160
Kiana's stress free but where am I she only makes four

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:39.240
It's six new things right. I know this is bad, but if we get more fans

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.840
It'll be worth more and yes, I know we're about to go into insane debt

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.960
But that's my choice to be a dumb dumb and puts on debt again

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.720
How much in the negative? Okay 200

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.640
That's not bad. We took down 200 in the payroll

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.280
From that piggy bank manoeuvre

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:01.000
A little bit. How much are you owing? I all pair day

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.760
Oh, it doesn't really say per day

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.760
Ha ha ha

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.120
You're too stressed out. That's okay. That's just very terrible timing

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.760
Good we're getting 200 per show. That's good

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.480
Uh, you're getting close to 200 per show which again, it's good

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.160
What how much do you get per show though?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.720
300 per show don't mind if I do

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.480
Don't mind if I do

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:53.800
Sure, uh, we don't have fit do we?

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.320
No

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:05.400
Oh, we do have fit okay promo fit go right Tiffany should have more fans

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.440
Depends on their work hours

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:21.400
No, no one will be getting a sign-on bonus until they've done their work. Did I make myself clear?

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.320
I think I'll go pick up another item because some of the girls don't hold anything

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.880
Probably gonna regret it, but go

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.960
One two five she makes more than the others

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.280
Right are your weakest link. Yeah, you are right go get us a new item

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.000
And then Tiffany you hurry up so we can put you on the site. Okay

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.760
Go. Okay. Yeah, she makes way more

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.560
Okay, okay, we're keen to get in there

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:01.560
I'm like did I just hoard money so I can put three items on the girls

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.720
Ico has the stream to make up the cost. See if I can get piggy bank

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.520
It's getting thrown on to Ico because she is just

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.120
stupendously

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.160
I recommend putting them to work 24 hours per day because every moment they're not working is useless stop

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.440
I wish I could make a joke right now, but that's hilarious

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.200
I'll let you cook again

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.680
You did fantastic. You're too stressed out though, which is fine. Um

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:39.080
Receive 20 plus cash each time you collect from the studio. There can be four girls in a building. I'm wondering if that's the best thing to do

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.040
Hold on let me cook but in a bad way

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.800
I'm gonna invest do that one

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.240
Oh wait, that didn't help

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:09.240
Hold on hold on piggy bank. Yes. Okay. We're gonna go all out. We're gonna go all out on

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:16.680
Getting the third item we give that to Ico then we're laughing to the bank because she just cost so much at this point in time

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:21.480
So that's done. Yeah, but we're getting 300 cash for what she does. Okay. We're going all out

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.640
We're going all out promo. We don't have these yet. So there's not really a point just yet and doing it

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.280
But we are going to try and get 2.5

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:35.080
thousand dollars

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:42.680
I'm enjoying this game so far. Sorry. I like it. I like these kind of funny asking right. What is the negative we're putting?

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:50.280
We can recover. Okay. We can rebuild. I repeat we can rebuild. What is promo today?

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.800
I think we have a flat chest. Who's flat Ico? No, you're not

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.040
We don't have a flat chest

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.560
But we do have a piggy bank so

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.040
We can do the s word

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.560
Hmm

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.720
You're too stressed out. Of course you're too stressed out

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:32.280
Okay, okay, we're going all out. We're gonna get this third item. We're gonna give it to Ico so she can stop draining our supply

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:39.960
Bad luck on ads today. Yes. I'm just gonna go all out on money. I'm gonna save every penny. I think we can do it

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:45.560
I think we can do it as soon as Ico gets that piggy bank. We're laughing because it hardly cost us a runner then

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.800
Come on

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.000
Come on. Why are these shows taking so long?

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:02.280
I feel like you'd be done after the two-hour mark. I'd be like, oh, I'm exhausted. Come on. Wrap it up everyone. Wrap it up

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:08.600
Give it a shot. Oh, we got a thousand right. We're at a thousand. We just need to do that again a week

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.600
Oh, you're too stressed out. Of course you are

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.840
Too stressed out right go make some money

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:21.400
Right. Well, we need a thousand more dollars and we're done and we're not at noon yet. So I think we can do it

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.640
Come on everyone wait hurry up and relax

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:32.280
Mm-hmm says the endurance streamer. Yeah, they must be rappers

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:40.040
Are they streamed for 12 hours a day? Okay, I'd be exhausted. I don't know how these girls aren't stressed out the wazoo

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.080
Okay, go again go again

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.800
You can do it right. Hurry up. Hurry up and finish. Yes. Go make some fans

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.480
And then go make 300 bucks go

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.960
Go go go make cash make cash. We need 500 more

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.400
Come on. We need 500 more

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:04.680
You would be exhausted

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.840
Where are you?

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.720
But there's something to do with some of the de-stressor options being

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.520
and

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.320
They must be yapers. Yeah, they probably yap for like three hours and like right. Let's get down to business

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.200
Oh, come on. We're so close to getting that upgrade

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:29.160
Yes, we're almost there. Come on

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.040
Go go go

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:43.160
Right, we did it. We did it. We did it. We did it. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I know this is against what I want, but

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.320
there

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.680
We've got enough

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.880
I would not we're really just shy. It's fine though. It's fine

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:55.640
Right piggy bank time piggy bank time for real for real god. That was 800. Are you fucking serious?

01:18:55.720 --> 01:19:02.680
Aiko you cost so much you cost so much money. Aiko you are running us into the ground. Do I make myself clear?

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.840
So is she be streamed? Hey

01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.040
Come on. Her yap is the best though

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.960
I want to go get cool. You did fantastic, but you're too stressed rubbish

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:25.000
She makes 300 now. Yeah, definitely need to get them more fans. That's how we're getting like any money

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:32.280
Right one more batch at the camp studio and then

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:38.040
Then we can upgrade to three items. Aiko gets the piggy bank. We can invest in another girl

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.800
We can start investing in the promos as well. What are we looking at to do?

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.880
Decent the cost are pretty penny though

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.680
You keep working the girls to death and everyone but Aiko makes like 75 cents a fan at best. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.800
Let me cook though. Let me cook slowly. Aiko high quality high cost. Yes

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.880
Yes, go make money

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Okay invest

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.160
item books, okay

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.640
you

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.880
Stop charging me a ridiculous amount of money

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.520
We should just get 18 fans. That's six hours or I can just get money

01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.720
You're too stressed out. You're allowed to be stressed out

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.320
Go make money

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:34.600
Right, so can I now get a fifth girl? I can and four girls to our building

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.760
And aesthetics

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:44.360
Training and aesthetics don't do anything

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:53.960
Building and then we'll get new staff about that and then I'll start sending them to the shops to get

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.040
Items to get more fans in certain categories wink wink

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.560
They took way too long to pick that now her corpus isn't gonna be in debt so it was something

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:14.920
Okay, I can do it. I know what I'm doing wink wink. I do not know what I'm doing

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:19.560
Yes, you're too stressed out. You're allowed to be it's okay

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:29.560
Go make some more fans. I think is oh someone needs to go right go recruit someone

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.840
And then we'll invest in some

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:42.040
We've got stuff for that so go invest in that I guess

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.600
Invest in a staff spot

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:54.120
All locations will all collect I don't really these kind of seem a bit arbitrary like we don't need it

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.160
5,000 a thousand

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.280
Maybe a thousand in product abuse seems best now

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:06.920
Second talent really makes 75 cent training correction is needed

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.080
I'm trying I'm trying

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:21.240
Oh Nikki has a huge tag. Sorry I keep forgetting

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.840
She makes 300 now

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.240
I

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.160
Don't know if I'm gonna regret that I probably am

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.760
Let's get the new girl in I don't know what the result is gonna be but let's get the new girl in

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:54.760
Nadia frequently well, it doesn't matter what they do to de-stress

01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:00.280
Sira gets fans though fan count 178

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:06.520
And we do have some crossover with this one, I think sira

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:11.640
Sira's an unbearable weeaboo. I think it's sira that wins. Look at the fan count that she comes with

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.840
And we already have the stuff to put on her

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.040
uh Nadia

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.680
Is a self-described

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:23.960
Russian goddess who used to provide sadistic

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.040
Okay, I remember Lidalia

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.640
Erin's one cash for each fan she has and she has 66

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:41.800
But if I level up sira, I want to say sira. What was that noise?

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:46.760
Uh-huh

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.200
Okay

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.400
Um

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:19.800
The premium pass but it only takes an hour what's the downside

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.760
Nasty dudes are walking around with

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:31.560
What's like without a little risk though am I right? They can get

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.360
You know what they can get a few dudes

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.680
Okay, we're gonna level her up go make some money at the moment

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.840
And

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.920
Okay

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.200
Oh my gosh, not real

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:02.040
Oh, she really is a weeb completely right go get some more fans I guess

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.080
Oh my gosh, okay. I need to put nicotine

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:14.200
She really goes arigato. Oh

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
It's a bit cringe for me hen. I have to admit

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.080
Ken is now level two talent goods. I'm glad

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.080
It goes well

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.120
Okay, there we go, but she costs more

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.840
All right, what are we looking at today?

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.000
That'll be worth it. That's worth it. That's worth the that is worth it as well. Actually

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.080
I think we'll do a full investment from

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.440
Need her for gen two right now

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.360
I don't know. I saw shebe's tweet on her all if you didn't see it. Don't worry. Um

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.440
But she doesn't she's unsure what she wants her

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.160
Finalized, um

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.080
Her 2.0 idea to be

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:15.880
All right, let's get some promo first because from promo is just more fans, which is good. So that's exactly what we're

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
wanting

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:25.640
Cheeky bit. Oh, I've just closed off the game. Oh, I almost just ruined that run there because I don't know if it auto saves or not

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:33.880
Okay, let's get right into it. We'll do the promo for it. Wait. Actually, we might be able to do it now

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:38.520
chubby Asian glasses and then that other word wink wink

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:47.000
Okay, and then we'll do investments. It all saves each day. Thank goodness because I accidentally clicked also

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.640
That could have gone terribly wrong

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.720
Okay

01:26:54.040 --> 01:27:02.360
You want 300 you're too stressed out, which is perfectly fine. Don't worry about it. You get 300 that's perfectly fine

01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.320
You did you did sugoi desune

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:09.320
You did so sugoi desune. Don't worry about it

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.880
Right invest

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:13.880
I don't want another girl at this point in time

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.240
Um elapsed three minutes each time you click

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.320
So what all locations no, that's rubbish

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:30.600
It might be hardware or advertisement each fan. Okay. Hmm. That might be worth the you get a receive five fans each time you collect

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.680
Wait, no, that's rubbish

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.340
It's web servers hardware advertising

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:39.560
Capacity is five grand

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.480
Up to six girls can be employed at once

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.400
It's either five grand for web servers hardware advertising is 1.5 and maybe advertising

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.640
It's the way to do it productivity is important. Am I be am I misunderstanding?

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:04.840
Hmm elapsed three minutes each time you click to rush an activity

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.200
Yeah, I'm I'm gonna just take on what you guys say

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:15.960
I'm not gonna doubt for a second that you guys are completely correct in what's going on. Okay

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.400
Um

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:25.480
Because this is confusing. I'm sure there's real strats that I could have but I'm being very dumb

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.480
Um

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.760
Right if you're all done, can we get you more fans? Maybe

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.440
No, I'd rather everyone just work right now

Nikki do not have a piggy bank. So let's just pop them on

She's out of the game, but Ren ain't gonna pay itself

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:58.360

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:08.120
Mmm, Tiffany's too stressed out. You're allowed to be stressed out

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.760
I think

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:15.560
Oh, I don't know

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:23.880
You know what I'm gonna do ads and then I'll do web servers, then I'll do capacity. How about that?

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.800
One point five one

01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:00.040
Higher a manager you already have six girls automation would be a time saver. Okay. Okay. What's automation?

01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:04.120
Productivity

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:08.920
Accounting since the profits are so who usually take minutes to collect

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:14.120
Lilene super edgy and honey pop to issue. She needs less stress take the plug on

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:21.720
Right next to automation 500. Okay, we can do that easy peasy. Let me squeeze that's so quick

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:25.560

500 book each

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.880

That seems OP is but what have I got we need a nicotine patch and then we can get a new girl if we want

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160

Okay promo no not promo. We'll do promo next actually. I just realized oh should we do capacity?

01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:54.520
We'll do capacity next but we'll do promo first if that makes sense

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.040
Because it is just free fans

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:05.000

01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.240

01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.000
All right, we really need capacity before we get the seventh girl

This game is eight years old. Yeah. Yeah

01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.880

You're too stressed that's fine

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.560

2014 was a decade ago old man emoji. She makes 1.2 now

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:32.840
Nicotine, okay, we can get a new girl without any issues now half the price

01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:37.720
But we wouldn't even be able to yeah, that's what I didn't want

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:41.400
At max capacity

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
You're so real for that

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.160

How'd I do fantastic? Oh, she's making so much though per show

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:06.120
right, we'll do

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:08.920
capacity staffing

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:11.560
next, okay

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:17.160
Don't start talking about the ages of things the first strike came out in 2001

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:20.040
Hey

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:23.880
I thought it was fake that strike five thing. I think you guys were trolling me to be honest

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:27.640
I was like, okay, you've got me. I believe do but I think it's actually real

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.360
Hold up a minute. I think it's real anything else. Yes, please more money. Go just go

01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.680
She does not make as much

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.760
just

01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:50.120
How about go recruit a girl and we'll get her when she's ready

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
2.7

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.600
Yeah

01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:58.920
Yeah

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:07.080
You've stolen that from me strong complain about paying a 1% wagery. You've yanked it. How dare you?

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:19.240
2000 this is okay, we're gonna get the five in a building we can do it. I believe I believe

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.080
2.4

01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:25.080
Don't mind if I do

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.920
All right productivity come on

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.440
Capacity and then staffing is 2.5

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.720
You do not make as much as the others though

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:44.840
You hardly make that much fans either. I'm just better at buying fans

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.720
With the ads on twitter ever lie surely not

01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:53.560
Play red dead redemption to actually want to play it

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:55.880
Um

01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:02.120
I've never played it before but everyone went crazy when it came out and apparently you can role play on it like gta servers

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.200
people like role play on gta servers

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.240
To stress out that's understandable. Have a nice day

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:16.600
Right our new girl who will we pick bailey asian and chubby and they called her bailey and she's chubby

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.840
She caters to chubby and she's called bailey. Okay, you're done

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:27.320
bailey was a conservative yoga instructor until recently when she discovered her true nature and frankly she kind of a freak

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.600
Um

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:36.600
Brooke is a wife mother in business woman who seeks out attention online from young men because her boring husband leaves her drier than a desert

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:44.600
Oh my gosh, okay. Lilian looks good to me. Lilian moved in from the pacific to get away from our strict family

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:50.760
She's asian and flat-chested. Yes. She never drinks so that is good. We can put an item on her

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.120
Right, so she is now waiting

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:59.400
To get stuff done which is fine

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:07.960
Uh, we'll send her off to get new items because if we can get another subscriber pillow that would be good

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.600
Um

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:18.200
Oh wait, can I get her now? Oh, I can I can already get her. Oh, we've got one more slot left

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:23.000
Right, you never drink so we don't need to give you wine

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:25.080
half price

01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:30.120
No smoking. We're about to get you an item though. Actually, I might send you in for an item as well

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.520
We're doing every flanks

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.080
We're gonna win totally wink wink. We're gonna win

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:40.920
I

01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:46.600
Might actually recommend the other viola girls play this because it seems like it takes like two hours per run

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:53.480
Seriously, right. I'm going to try and get the last girl. I didn't realize how close to 71 days we were

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.360
right invest in who glasses

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:01.160
We're going to invest in uh nicky because she's so good

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:15.000
I'd just invest in it random and hope it pays off. It's a boy disney

01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:20.520
That's because promo is promo

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:26.600
Yes, fantastic go again. Oh my god. She's 3000 per shot now

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:30.200
No, it's a new day. I missed it drat

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:36.280
1000 really isn't like good. I might just keep telling her to go get more fans

01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.960
Oh

01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.440
Oh, no, she makes more than the other girl though

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:49.320
Piece of cake go again go again thing, please

01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:51.960
okay

01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:53.960
Hickey bank

01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:57.560
We just need a nicotine patch and we can get the last girl just like that

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Go make some fans

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.040
Oh wait, we didn't get a nicotine patch this time

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.480
Oh

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:17.720
Let's do sheepsters who can even pick up

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.920

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.760
What does she need she needs another tag that we can capitalize on about you

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:37.560
You can just take on anything as well. Okay, right. We're gonna send you back into the shop

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.760
There's no five in the camp studio, which is hilarious

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:48.040
I'm not sure you're gonna get the diamond trophy. I'm not even sure we're gonna get the last recruit

01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.440
It costs 10,000 to pick up someone now

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:53.880
Literally 10,000 to get the last girl

01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:57.160
That's insane

01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:00.680

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.040
Motel time

01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.400
Possibly

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:22.680
We can't even pick up the money that fast like it's taken so long

01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:27.400
So we can't even like make the time go by faster

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.320
Any point in doing for sure

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.000
Oh

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.400

Neckle ears or bandage. We just do bandage

01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:21.400

That's a nicotine patch. Oh, did I mess up right?

01:55:57.640 --> 01:55:59.080

You're full you're full you're full full full. Oh, you can still actually get an item

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:08.040
Even after all this time

01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:14.200
Right, someone's getting sent to go and pick up a new girl. I don't know who it is. I don't care who it is

01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:17.480
Hopefully we can have someone that's a non-smoker

01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:22.920
But go go get a new girl

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:25.480

We're doing it. That's where the income upgrade comes in. Yes

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:40.440
I'm starting to understand why they offered it because it made no sense. I was like, yeah collect money faster

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:42.440
But it's because you can't upgrade

01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:47.000
The dang thing you did fantastic. Go make some fans

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:49.880

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:09.720
Marlina is a brazilian bombshell who basically cost her life on the rebellion look. She's very confident and extremely narcissistic

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:17.560

01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:39.480
I don't know how because I'm not a guy and I don't know what it's like to try and get a girl

01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:43.560
Right everyone go pick up items because I think

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:47.480

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:55.000
Okay, subscribe pillow. Sorry subscribe pillows to op you're too stressed out. That's fine, right

Yeah, everyone's now full so no one needs to go to the shop again. Oh, I just closed my game again

02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.040
No one needs to go to the shop

02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:45.560
Again, so we're wasting our time being in the shop right now. I'm not even kidding

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:49.400

Thank you. I didn't know us. Okay. No one has a free slot now. We're good to go

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:23.400
Everyone just makes some fucking money

02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:25.480
Hey

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:30.120
And then we can invest in this picking up money thing because it's getting in the way

02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:34.280
It's getting in the way clout for

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:38.760
Look, it doesn't matter just be yourself. I had that workspace exactly

02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:42.360
If you have to change

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.160
Then is it true love if you're not being yourself you're too stressed out

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:52.280
Okay, we're at 10 000 promo. Do we bother with promo?

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.040
Just buy it just just buy. Okay. Just buy it

02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:01.480
Okay, we're not going off yet

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:06.680
Just buy all the promo because it's fans and it means I don't have to send them to the cast and oh

02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:11.400
I've done it again. Stop clicking off your good figure right work work

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.960
Everyone go work

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Do I make myself clear?

02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:21.000
Work work work. Oh, we're at max capacity

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.360
Okay, go wait who makes more you make more

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:33.400
Hold on hold on i'm gonna invest in the max capacity 25 000

02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:40.040
I really i'm not gonna waste it. I'll just get her to get more fans

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:46.280
Whoever is that lower one look at all those subscribers. They got 10 000 subscribers. Let's go

02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:53.640
Oh, they got 9.7 000 subscribers. They got more subscribers than me and it's like they've been at it for 21 days

02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.840
They're cheating

02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:00.200
Uh go make some more fans

02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:05.640
Okay, we're on the last day I think

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:10.680
Go go

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:15.080
I don't know if we can do the

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.440
Invest in anything more really

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:25.400
Maybe this I don't send anyone on photo shoots though. So it's not really a point

02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:32.920
I'll do accounting for now because they're grabbing so much money. It's like hard

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:40.200
Right you hardly make nothing so let's not waste our time you make 4k

02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:46.200
Maybe we can get the upgrade you did fantastic, but you're too stressed. That's okay

02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:50.040
I'm getting the silver trophy aw ye

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.360
Hi, I love how she does that

02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:00.280
5 000

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:03.400
Well, I just buy it in promo maybe

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.400
I

02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:12.760
Have no idea what to do at this point. I mean I've got everyone and people are just rotating between like

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.600
5 000 that's good. We're just rotating between like

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.080
I don't really make a lot. I feel like the girls make a bit more than you

02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.840
How the fuck is goth not making money? I tell everything I owe for her

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:36.440
I've not leveled them all up at any point. Um, Candice is too stressed. That's fine

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:45.720
Might as well

02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:49.080
Oh

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:54.680
Right, let's go optimize for fans. I've not maxed my investments because I suck

02:04:55.400 --> 02:05:02.280
Okay, we've got 25 let's buy capacity so everyone can be making money

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:06.120
It doesn't matter if they're low or high everyone can make money

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.760
That's the focus

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:11.240
Go make money

02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:15.720
So I can pay everyone off because I actually need to pay for everyone's thing

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:18.360
I think we're about to end

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:24.120
Does the game let you continue to play or you're too stressed

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:33.240
I'll just keep the money on hand or do I get like points for fan amount maybe possibly

02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:36.680
Go oh you're too stressed

02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:43.400
Go make money go go go. Oh, it's the last day today. Okay

02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:47.640
It's the last day today. I don't think we can do anything in particular

02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:53.400
You'd have to do a new run bronze five silver 10 25 fans is

02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.040
platinum

02:05:56.840 --> 02:06:00.760
50 and diamond is a hundred fucking cute fans are you serious?

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:03.720
So I guess just buy promo

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.280
And then we can hit what?

02:06:06.680 --> 02:06:08.920
Oh, we're not gonna reach platinum. There's no way

02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:13.640
There's no way we're reaching platinum

02:06:15.480 --> 02:06:17.480
I can't see it

02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:20.680
10k maybe

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:24.840
Sure

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.840
Just spending the money

Kitsune game and thank you for becoming a member

I'm going to do back-to-back membership streams. I'm gonna do daily membership streams and public streams

02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:47.480
Please don't think I've forgotten you if you're unable to member. Please don't worry. It's not it's honestly not a big deal with me at all

02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:49.480
um

02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:52.600
I always got free content coming out. I actually have a patreon audio

02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:58.200
Early access for youtube. I don't know if I can upload it yet. It's me sitting on the mic ASMR

02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:00.360
But because I was like squatting over it

02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:03.080
I was getting out of breath and I'm like I can't upload it

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:07.320
Like I've got two shorts that I want to upload but I don't want to do it until the warning's gone

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:12.520
In case I get a warning for it because I really do not want to strike. I do not want to break my streaming streak

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:17.240
Um, I would be so upset and mad at myself if I did

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:25.800
We've been thoroughly drained into literally you thought my stamina was good for like bruvs you're done for

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:33.240
Oh man, thank you for the 10 gifted memberships. Congrats to whoever caught them with your face

02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:37.560
Um, the emotes are coming. I'm waiting on mercedes emotes next

02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:43.880
Um, let's just buy the promo. I don't know how many fans it's going to get me but oh 18k

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:48.840
Fans we could have got 25k, but we can't do it

02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:53.800
Unless what 64 fans that's not going to cut it. Are you joking?

02:07:55.480 --> 02:08:01.000
Right, we've got 300 more fans we can buy new emotes. Yes new emotes are on the way for everyone

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:04.680
Emmy and aces new emotes have already been uploaded

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:09.480
They should be lurking in the shadows. They actually have a few more emotes slots to go

02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:11.960
So they can get more if they so desire

02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.480
8k for that. Wow

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.920
Um, I don't need emotes when I have what png that wasn't a png heart. Well

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.360
Um

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:29.160
Uh-oh

02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:36.680
Okay, go are you too stressed?

02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:39.000
Right, we've done it

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:46.920
We finished our run. This is the last night. We ended with 20 000 that's not horrific. It could have been worse

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:50.120
It could have been worse

02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.440
Could have been worse

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:55.720
Um

02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:00.920
Could have been worse, but I'll just leave the money on hand. I don't want to end when we can't pay them

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.720
So we'll just shove them back in here

02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:06.840
png that wasn't a png. Wow

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:15.480
Time flies you're having fun, doesn't it? That was two hours to play that. That's fun. That was like a perfect stream game for one run

02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:21.080
Oh god, complete a game session without dropping below five cigarettes or drinks. Oh

02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:23.880
diligent degeneracy

02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:25.880
Hmm

02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:28.200
Minutes rushed

02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:29.880

Lifetime revenue two eight seven. We made quarter of a million most popular tiffani least popular

Latina most popular was tattoos. We only hired like one tattoo isn't lily in the only tattooer

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:48.920
I didn't realize how much I was covering up of the downstream. Yeah, I maybe should have sat here in the middle, but

02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:51.640
Uh, yeah, we lily in

02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:54.440

Most expensive. Yeah, I call you were so expensive. Erin girl was kiana. Sorry kiana

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:06.680
Even though I can see it in the top corner question mark

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:14.360
That's awful, I love it

02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:20.360
Stop that's so silly. I love that

02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:29.960
Wait, we've got point. What's this tokens are used to unlock outfit new hairstyle and wardrobe via the title screen

02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:34.120
Ah, we were so close to gold. We could have been snack bang in the middle

02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:42.600
P good peeler allegations

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.400

Or and earn some more wardrobe tokens, okay

02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:00.040
Personally, I don't really care mostly because I'm not real later. Oh

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.800
Lillian wait, how'd that continue? Yeah continue

02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:11.960
I just want to keep playing it because I just want to see how long it takes me to get everything unlocked

02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.720
What's next?

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.440
Immersion broken

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.400

Haven't seen all right. I want to finish all the investments off really quickly. Let's just buy everything in sight

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:33.240
Get through a strong a real no high scoring. Oh, I'm not that good at the game

02:11:36.680 --> 02:11:39.320
Let's try and get all the upgrades and then I'll redirect

02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:43.880
Um, I assume she be is live question mark

02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:51.160

Not promo sorry investments. Uh, it doesn't really matter what one now. We're not against the clock

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Oh, lily and make seven k now

I had to cancel it yesterday because I went to sleep. Um, I was not very well all yesterday

02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:13.400
What do you mean pushing yourself daily is a terror? Wait, why he cost 13 000 to get that? I'm not buying them anymore

02:13:14.760 --> 02:13:18.280

02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:34.600
Streaming and then like doing stuff every single day. So the plan is every other day. We're gonna try and do something

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:36.600
um

02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:43.080
Because I was like hyper stressed out yesterday like I was watched back some of the stream and I was like really unhappy

02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:45.880
I was like, why did I even stream like that's so silly

02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:50.280
I just felt like dumb that I pushed myself to do it

02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:54.680
But I'm glad I didn't like take a day off or anything because that would annoyed me true

02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:57.160
True AF dempa. How are you doing?

02:13:58.120 --> 02:13:59.960
Candice is too stressed out

02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:01.960
She is

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.240
And

02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:09.480
What's too stressed out? That's fine. You're allowed to be stressed out. It's only human nature. I'm only human

02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:15.320
Buildings can have eight girls in them. Yeah, I think I'm gonna do that because that's hilarious eight key

02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:18.200
Nine key not bad

02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:20.680
How long is your dad gonna stay?

02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:29.960
We actually so I thought it was three weeks. It's not it's already two weeks. Your dedication is inspiring

02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:32.040
Thank you. It's the autism

02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:34.760
You want to make six thousand?

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:41.880
Lilian's too stressed out. Okay, you can go chill. Don't worry about it. You chill out

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.280
Oh, wait, I just realized I have to pay them still

02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.160
Eeps forgot to pay them. Okay, maybe we'll do promo

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.280
Anything shove on anyone

02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:56.120
Doesn't matter who

02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:58.120
The more fans the better

02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:05.640
Keep telling you to take it easy. I will eventually well I go jumped from five thousand to eight thousand per go

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:07.720
Hold on get some more fans

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.400
Everyone's going to the photo shoot because what the heck? Why was that so much?

02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:21.080
How much do you make you too stressed out? What do you she makes fans every time she goes so

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:25.160
Payroll processed. I didn't go in the negative. Let's go

02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:28.120
You're too stressed out

02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:34.520
Mmm

02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:41.240
Right, let's make if you're not at ten thousand per show then you're getting shoved into the photo studio

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:48.600
Ten thousand you make three thousand you make nothing. Please don't do that. That's how she must have lost something

02:15:48.760 --> 02:15:50.840
I don't know what oh you play getcha

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:55.000
Your dad's a favorite food, uh, no idea

02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:57.880
Please kill me

02:15:57.880 --> 02:15:59.880
You're so real for them

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:04.520
Um, we made chicken last night, but I'm having steak today

02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:07.480
Okay, she makes ten thousand so you can go in

02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:10.280
You have my permission to go do a show

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:13.560
um

02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.360
You do not make ten thousand yet

02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.280
Are we

02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:23.080
Are we making nothing? I'm gonna have to upgrade her

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:28.920
Nine thousand go you make twelve thousand

02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.080
These girls are making that mula you make eight thousand. Maybe I need to

02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:41.320
Do that. Yeah, I think I need to upgrade them. Why isn't he kicking? He is he's kicking for me. I've never eaten so good

02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:43.800
I've never washed so good as well

02:16:44.040 --> 02:16:48.120
It's like I'm actually having daily showers a Christmas miracle right everyone's going to the club

02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:51.880
As well. Everyone's getting fans. Everyone's going to the club

02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:57.560
I will do glasses because uh nicky's glasses and she's currently our biggest money maker

02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:02.360
Okay, ten thousand that's good

02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:06.200
Eight thousand right that there

02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:11.640
Did slow cook more I did marinate a chicken with them

02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:17.160
He I like have never bought ziploc bags to marinate chicken before but I really enjoyed it

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:23.640
So I'll probably be doing it on this on my own when it goes away. You have rubbish fans

02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:30.760
Your fans hate you what's going on here the pheromones it's ogre

02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:34.360
So any work in the girls like

02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:43.400
Ten thousand right you're allowed to go you're too stressed. What are you you're ten thousand you're allowed to go

02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:48.600
And I'll send them to the studio to get a few more fans as well

02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:57.240
So no more coins to be I've actually had normal movements as well. I know that's so gross to talk about but it's true

02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:00.120
Serious is maxed out. Well, do the

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.040
All right, you're too stressed

02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:08.760
Okay, our income charge is gonna go up but

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:12.520
Eight thousand not enough go make some more fans

02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:20.120
Regular bread honestly, I've never eaten so properly. I've never washed daily in like so long

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:25.400
I'm gonna very quickly go grab a can of cola. I will be right back. I don't even

02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.520
I just went out to get a can of cola. Did you hear it?

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000

And I didn't hear it. Yep tweeting right now. No stop

02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:19.480
Bless them. We didn't realize I was finished

02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:25.240
Okay, ten thousand right you're getting a bit better. We're gonna put your style up though

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:28.280
We didn't hear nothing except you yelling

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Just uh stop stop

02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:36.200
Stop no talking no toky toky

02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:40.200
30 000 oh my goodness

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:43.160
Right, we're gonna invest in

02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:45.720
capacity maybe

02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:49.720
Right max capacity goods

02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:53.640
So everyone can go to work if we want

02:19:56.200 --> 02:19:57.800
Which is good

02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:02.680
You weren't kidding about the fool. Hey, can he help it cannot for the life of him help it

02:20:02.760 --> 02:20:06.120
I'm like don't don't say my name. Don't say my name. Don't say my name. Don't say my name

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:08.920
Don't say my name. I don't know how many times I said I've said a stream

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:13.160
4 a.m. 6 a.m. Don't say anything. Don't do anything. Don't phone anyone. Don't like

02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.000
bro

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:21.240
That's why I'm like I can't I can't have them on stream not even for the teehee funny ha ha. I can't I genuinely cannot

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:24.760
No name got dropped. Thank you for checking. I appreciate it

02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:27.800
So basically your POV was

02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:36.840
That was your POV she was brining along double two

02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:39.880
I can't tell you if I heard or not. Mm-hmm

02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:42.920
He's innocent. He taught me

02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:50.520
Finish pure path. But I don't worry. He's not actually in trouble. He understands. It's silence. You screaming. Don't say my name

02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:57.800
Um, I thought you're screaming because no cola. That's hilarious

02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:00.920
Maybe her name is chicken. You've got me

02:21:03.240 --> 02:21:05.240
You're too stressed out. That's okay

02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:07.880
Right. We have a lot of money

02:21:08.920 --> 02:21:10.360
Let's do

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:12.360
this one

02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:19.960
Full shoot. Sure. Why not advertisements maxed out? Oh, mate. Wow. Maybe we should advertise maxed out advertisement and just bought

02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:22.280
Fans for that 25k

02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:26.440
Get him used to calling you strong. Well, it's because he doesn't need to in any other context

02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:33.080
Yes, I can do that. Give it a shot. Should have muted. I will definitely mute every time I leave the room now because yeah

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:39.400
I thought that was gonna be okay. Okay. Oh, no, I just oh, she's not leveled up enough to utilize any of that

02:21:42.120 --> 02:21:46.680
Maybe the name is ah your POV scream reminded me of starfox 64 death

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:49.400
fox

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.400
Is it bad?

02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:56.280
Did I do you have butchers headphones? No, I do not actually

02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:00.200
All locations will all collect

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:07.560
That's the hardware. Why not? We're almost fully maxed out and then we'll just level everyone up

02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:14.200
Once you get used to stormy, it's gonna be a problem cause we're strong all the time going forward

02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:17.160
No, I mean if her name is ah, then I think I

02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:24.280
Can't even a few things start a name with that. Oh be Flynn. That's funny. You can't say that out loud

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
That's

02:22:29.720 --> 02:22:35.000
God nicky makes 18 ago that subscriber pillow is so OP

02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:55.800
Cause she doesn't

02:22:56.840 --> 02:22:58.840
You're so real for that

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:03.160
Maybe I'll send her to get a subscriber pillow

02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:06.120

02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:28.200

Nicky started as a as a girl who got fans for I know she prints money because all the fans are rightfully hard

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:49.960
Do you need to be concerned about cost right now you could replace piggy bank or something else

02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:55.400
I'd rather not risk it like I just want to do the full upgrade run just to see what it's like

02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:57.960
What else you got?

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.040

It was called like explosion veiler and it's me talking about the sonic heroes. Oh, I see

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:15.160
Someone was like plagiarism and I'm like, no motherfucker. That's called influence. You can be influenced by things

02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:19.720
Oh my god, we are making the moolah though

02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:24.520

Hey the guy and he was like, yeah, sure I can make something like this and it's completely different

02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:45.800
You can hear the influence if you listen to the song, but it's completely different

02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:48.600
We've been influenced by a moment

02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:51.000

02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:51.560
Together last upgrade

02:31:55.240 --> 02:31:58.680
If you could choose a design any of the girls have for a future den

02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:01.400
I think I want to make she be gay to

02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:06.600
She seems to have an interest in it and if she doesn't want to submit for that

02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:11.640
So, um, if the girls sign on for another year, uh, we

02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:15.640
Vealer offer them a free alternative outfit

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:19.560
Um, they just tell us what they want and we'll get it concepted and if they're happy with it

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:21.560
We pay for it and all that type thing

02:32:21.720 --> 02:32:28.680
Um, so if she picks something else that isn't gairu, I'd love to offer gairu if she signed on for another year because

02:32:29.480 --> 02:32:31.480
It goes that

02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:34.520
Oh, you're too stressed out completely

02:32:40.840 --> 02:32:42.520
Sorry, I'm trying to

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:44.920
Like all play this game, but it's not working in my head

02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:47.640
Time to grind. Yes

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:49.960
um, I'm currently

02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:58.440
Hyper focused on Azura getting moved out because I think once she moves out she will have so much more time

02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:01.400
to be able to

02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:09.400
Really hone her craft because uh, Azura's got it. She just needs enabled and I hope her donathan has come

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.000
It's on the 21st of august

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:16.680
So don't be shy to you know, keep a little little five dollars back. That would be very kind of you even

02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:22.120
Small things add up very quickly. So, uh, please do if you are

02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:24.280
um

02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:29.480
Written for the girls. Um, I would absolutely love to see Azura's donathan go off the wazoo

02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:32.120
Um

02:33:32.120 --> 02:33:34.600
You make absolutely nothing go get some fans

02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:37.640
It's too stressed. That's fine

02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:44.920
Um, she did the gairu classmate roleplay. Yes, we we redirected inter and her per head was coming off her neck

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.160
I do not know how to use the booth stuff

02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:50.040
so, um

02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.800
What was that half a million that better be the last one because that's insane

02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:56.920
Azura the goat for real for real. Yes. Um

02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:03.640
Like she's interested in doing youtube roleplays like just to put up stuff for free like more content basically

02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:09.480
But due to our living situation, I mean, you know where it's like it's busy houses are busy. That's just how it is. Um

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.520
So we're gonna try and get her moved up

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:20.360
Dullahan gairu bunny stop. That's actually quite funny

02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:23.640
Not in a mean way though

02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:27.000
You just like plop it on to be honest over the top layer

02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:29.560
What what?

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:31.560
What was the context of that?

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:37.080

02:34:54.520 --> 02:35:00.440
Optimization literally, I think it must be you need more fans, but I'm like being a twat and not understanding

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.720

Oh, we're almost there, but we're about to have to pay her wages

02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:18.680
We'll do

02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:24.440
Early subscribe pillow leveling the girl's styles, etc. Yeah

02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:51.640
I might not I'm not sure yet. I haven't decided yet

02:42:53.080 --> 02:42:55.080
Please

02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:57.400
Yep, I'm going

02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:03.960
Okay, we're at 50k subscribers for the girls

02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:07.800
At one month in we're at 50k subscribers. Not bad at all

02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:11.080
Very good very good

02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:14.680
Sure

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:16.760
Promo

02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:18.760
I did not have enough money for this

02:43:19.720 --> 02:43:23.400
50k that's insane 50k for one k

02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:27.800
Are you too stressed?

02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:30.680
And

02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:33.320
I don't think so

02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:36.840
She private it think because she came on hinge and the human was scared to get in a strike

02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:39.720
She's not on a warning though Azura

02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:43.400
Emmy and myself are on a warning

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:48.600
So she would actually receive a warning unless she's not told me she's got a warning. She even

02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:50.920
Do you have a warning?

02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:55.800
Too stressed out have a spuddy

02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:59.160
Too stressed out have a spuddy

02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.840
47 grand she makes here

02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:13.720
We'll just get a hundred key fans and then we'll send Lillian to the motel and we're done

02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:20.600
Um, I got a warning for an audio of me

02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:28.840
Actually, it was because I had the audacity to breathe in the mic. I uploaded an audio called clapping without my hands and

02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:32.840
YouTube time stamped where I went wrong

02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:37.160
What got the warning for and it was when I breathed in the ear of the mic

02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:40.840
It wasn't the actual content of the

02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:42.680
the

02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:44.680
Video if you will

02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:46.760
It was because I breathed in the mic

02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:49.800
And the time stamped it to when I was in the mic like hey

02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:56.200
Yeah, so I might actually be cheeky and upload it again and cut it out at the end section

02:44:57.240 --> 02:44:59.800
Um, because that's what the problem was

02:45:00.920 --> 02:45:02.920
Please kill me

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Okay promo

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Just buy it all

02:45:07.240 --> 02:45:11.640
50 69 subscribers at all according to plan

02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:20.040
It's funny that the actual clapping was okay. I know it's redonkulous 51,000

02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:26.840
Holy moly 51,000

02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:31.080
58,000

02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:33.240
Oh

02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:46.120
Yeah, you have 20 key fans

02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:52.360
100 fans per photo shoot. I don't know if that's worth it though. I think I'm better just farming

02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:55.880
Advertisements

02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:58.840
Uh, no, leave it to me if you say so

02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:03.560
If you say so over 9,000 on youtube something

02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:06.440
Um, like I have I have two shorts

02:46:06.440 --> 02:46:09.480
I want to upload but I'm too scared to do it until that warning's gone

02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:14.680
But the warning goes away august like 20th, so it's gonna be takes so long

02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:22.760
Because one of them is about ear licking but there's no breathing in it

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:25.720
And I think it looks okay if there's no breathing

02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:31.240
Yep, I'm going

02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:36.520
Okay promo, uh, just buy anything

02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:42.360
Everyone get to work and yeah august I think august

02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:47.880
12th or something is when it goes away. I can't remember but it's in august

02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:53.240
It's a bit harsh for a warning. Yeah in last 98 well a warning isn't a strike

02:46:53.400 --> 02:47:00.280
So it's actually more preferred to get a warning because if I got a strike it meant I couldn't stream for an entire week

02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:04.360
Um, which that would have that would have upset me far more than

02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:07.400
anything else

02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:12.760
Can't wait for the orwell stream tinfoil hat. Oh, yeah pure tinfoil hat. I'm not even kidding

02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:17.080
Um, it is a bit of a reading simulator, but don't worry. I'll do the reading

02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:21.320
I'll do all of that jazz so you don't have to think

02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:23.800
um

02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:26.120
I played it many a year ago now

02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:31.240
So I don't actually and I never fit it. I never got the correct ending in the game

02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:35.160
So we're gonna try and get it together. You guys might be able to figure it out before I can

02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:38.520
Um

02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:40.520
But yes

02:47:40.680 --> 02:47:44.920
Anything else more work 51 000. Let's go

02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:51.880
I will promo uh chubby

02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:58.840
A week without money mommy. I don't want to a imagine a week without money money

02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:01.960
I said it the wrong way, but I know what I was trying to say. Okay. Me

02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:04.680
At least just rest up

02:48:04.680 --> 02:48:08.040
They probably don't want mode schools to the make I think you're looking

02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:12.680
I don't know if I think is breathing with ear licking at the moment. Um

02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:16.680
It's rather strange what's going on. Um

02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:23.080
Rather strange indeed. I wish they would just come out and be like hey, you can't do this anymore

02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:27.400
But youtube's was like ASMR is like the top 10 searches

02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:30.280
and

02:48:31.560 --> 02:48:36.040
So obviously they probably don't want to be like publicly coming out with like oh we

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
Have fun it by the way

02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:45.720
Just need to find the new ASMR mail. Well, I've ordered the denpa

02:48:46.920 --> 02:48:47.880
Uh

02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:53.000
Mould shall we call it? If you know what I'm saying denpa did a very egregious audio

02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:56.120
Okay, which made me laugh more so

02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:03.160
Are we at a thousand? Hey everyone's at a thousand! It was a thousand for for the diamond, right?

02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:05.400
Oh

02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:08.920
The chill bro, you got the ace. Yes, I got the ace

02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:13.400
Um, I also am getting another prop

02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:17.320
Um for a stream and also the 10 key stream

02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:20.840
I think it was 100k

02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:28.760
What is a denpa denpa is a fellow vtuber

02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:32.680
Um, and I collabed with her on the alien collab that's on my channel

02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:41.320
Two out of six isolure confirmed. Yeah, I sorry, but um, he's actually so smart. I'm legit copy and pasting her strats

02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:45.400
Denpa cooked with that one

02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:48.600
At denpa literally

02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:53.720
I'm sorry. I suppose youtube doesn't have more competitors for some of their weird occurrences

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.320
So it's been tried. What's her name?

02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:03.240
Uh, is it it's not frivolous folks. What's that other asmr?

02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:05.800
uh

02:50:05.800 --> 02:50:07.560
Gibi

02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:08.600
Asmr

02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:10.600
Attempted it and it didn't work

02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:13.960
It

02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:15.160
Because

02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:22.360
You need people you can't have free users on it, but it's still like didn't work at the end of the day, which is such a shame

02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:27.240
How much oh, but you get so many fans for it though

02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:33.160
There was a youtube for asmr. I wish

02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:36.920
They realized if they had ads

02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:39.640
um

02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:45.240
If they had asmr friendly ads like people would be more likely to run ads like at this point in time

02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:48.680
YouTube force ads at the start and end of videos

02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:52.600
It never used to be like that, but now it is like that which is a shame

02:50:53.880 --> 02:50:57.480
100k reach. Okay. Is that it's done. Is that what the diamond was?

02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:04.680
Shubby flat chested put all my stonks in there

02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:10.120
It's also expensive af to host. Yeah, literally

02:51:11.240 --> 02:51:17.960
I don't know if uh another site could be right raised up like that like youtube have a monopoly

02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:20.680
Oh

02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:28.360
It is a very I love listening to soft asmr playlist and then being blasted by a trucker

02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:34.200
Yeah, like I don't know how on earth they come out and be like, yeah asmr is in the top 10 searches

02:51:34.600 --> 02:51:38.040
But haven't cracked that if they had acceptable

02:51:38.600 --> 02:51:40.120
levels of

02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:42.280
You are really lagging behind why?

02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:48.760
Oh, she doesn't have a third thing to bounce off of

02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:03.320
To make another youtube you would need a time machine. Yeah, like the competition is so hard like

02:52:04.120 --> 02:52:06.440
I think rumble is probably the only

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:11.480
It's not even a competitor. Oh, no, I just put no, I didn't want you in the hotel

02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:19.640
No, it's supposed to be her. Right. I'm putting her in the hotel now

02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:23.880
Lilithin Lilithin is going in the hotel. Uh

02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:30.360
We will we're gonna let you have some ciggies. Okay, you're gonna need ciggies after this, but take that way. Okay

02:52:31.240 --> 02:52:33.240
So now she's got a piggy bank

02:52:33.480 --> 02:52:36.200
Uh, she needs that. Okay, and then this too

02:52:37.800 --> 02:52:41.400
Man that meet and greets going wild for her. Oh, she's in the photo shoot right now

02:52:42.680 --> 02:52:44.680
I love it. Okay

02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:53.160
We've never done this before wink wink. We're we're gonna send her. I guess if you a little you utilize the sleazy motel

02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:55.400
You could potentially oh, she just said we say

02:52:58.040 --> 02:53:04.680
Okay, go 60k in one hour. Yep. I'm going. Oh, yeah, that definitely seems worth it

02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:10.920
Whoa, we're running a little low on cigarettes and booze. We should really take care of that ASAP

02:53:11.880 --> 02:53:16.440
A lot of these cam girls like to smoke and drink. We haven't unlocked this part of this tutorial

02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:22.680
A girl who smokes and drinks a lot isn't going to get us stressed out from doing activities

02:53:23.720 --> 02:53:29.560
But if you run out of cigs or drinks, she's gonna start to get real stressed out real quick

02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:34.520
Okay, so if it looks like we're running low you need to have somebody run to the store and stock up

02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:38.440
This is the liquor store. Oh my gosh. Wait

02:53:39.240 --> 02:53:41.240
We didn't oh

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:47.400
I must have like I must have remembered from the fuck I used to watch that you need to maintain this

02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:51.240
That is hilarious

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:56.920
So it takes only 10 cigarettes what?

02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:02.200
Per run

02:54:03.560 --> 02:54:08.360
That's gonna get out of hand so quickly and then actual well, we made a million though

02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:11.240
Yeah, I'm going

02:54:13.400 --> 02:54:15.400
That's crazy

02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:25.400
Oh fantastic needs to get full efficiency liquor IV drip. So we're still in this tutorial. No, we did it. We did it

02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:31.560
Oh, there's a pie chart. Oh tattoos is winning

02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:36.760
Chubby

02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:41.400
Latina's the smallest

02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:49.480
Oh, it like tells you who's like doing that as well. Oh, okay. Okay. Wait, so

02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:53.320
Chubby fit

02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:55.560
Uh, that one

02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:57.320
Okay

02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:00.520
Yeah, you can definitely optimize the heck out of this

02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:07.880
Okay. Yeah, I'm starting to understand goth solo carry. I'm telling you goth is winning. He's still having this though

02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:11.400
Well, I think we did it

02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:15.480
Uh, I think we're we're done. So

02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:21.800
We've gotten what we can total fan count like I don't think we need to do anything

02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:25.880
That was fantastic. I've really enjoyed that game

02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:30.920
Hold on. Let me let me pop my background music on and then mute the game. So it's not annoying

02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:35.560
Uh, right. Let's see if sheepsters is live so I can redirect into her

02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:38.280
Please don't be in a membership stream. Please don't be in a membership stream

02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:43.560
Uh, right customization redirect

02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:49.160
And she's playing elden ring. Let's go. I can redirect into her

02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.880
Is she for a cd? No, she's put shields on her chest. That is hilarious

02:55:55.800 --> 02:56:00.600
Uh, the goth will say something like I don't want to take the lead and letting the other girls be ahead of the agency

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.640
Hold on a minute. Is it gonna be a goth girlfriend of vealer too?

02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:09.480
Uh, vealer to the vealer ring. That is hilarious. Let me write that down

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:15.560
It only took you roughly 10 more days to reach the 100k if you didn't want to probably get the gold medal

02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:22.680
No goth girl need a slim girlfriend too. Well next week we're drawing your suggestions on ms paint

02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:24.760
So I hope you're ready for that craziness

02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:27.320
um

02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.400
That was such a fun game. Okay. So tomorrow is orwell

02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:36.840
And then the day after is the vealer collab. I've got balutroll

02:56:36.840 --> 02:56:43.320
But that's actually getting swapped out for another stream because I am watching yumi plus's concert

02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:50.760
That's right. Yumi plus have a concert and I'm getting paid and I get to watch a concert

02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:55.240
I'd rather have goth than slime
