6
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,420
to capture it's really close to the revamped or something hello I sorry I

7
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,220
took so long I was just discovered I was blocked by a vtuber on Twitter because

8
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:21,580
I posted my income laughing because I just showed mercy at mercies like wait I know her

9
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:29,820
that's a streamer I'm like oh right anyway so I've just got the tea but it's fine the

10
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:38,060
tea's fine what the heck can I see it right I'll DM you at Denver but apparently it's a streamer I

11
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,060
didn't recognize them and then mersey's like what the fuck I know her like oh well she hates me

12
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:54,540
because wait wait I'll quote it well I quote it I mean it's not I just find it funny that

13
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,260
they insulted me and then popped off I have no idea because it blocked me but there you go Denver

14
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:06,940
there's the tea don't clock it too hard how pet literally it's it oh fuck I'll just read the

15
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:13,260
comment because it's funny one hour ago that's because you're a part of a lude smaller agency

16
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,780
in quotation marks well yeah I start from the ground up you think this is hollow life

17
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,340
which honestly has to be the easiest job with pay pigs and I'm like

18
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,780
that is so fucking rude to the viewer that is so fucking rude to the viewer I am so sorry

19
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:44,140
but those attitudes and nastiness is why if you do not show your appreciation

20
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:52,780
in the basic way in any way you can so last night for example I recorded two collab ASMRs and then

21
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,700
more SFX and all that shit I've had seven hours of sleep because I'm also juggling everything for

22
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,340
my daughters um I'm streaming every day and like I'm trying to show appreciation for the people

23
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,580
that do enjoy me and watch me and someone's analysis was it must be so fun having pay pigs

24
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:21,980
no motherfucker ew don't be so fucking gross honestly a damn no fandom here rip rip but anyway

25
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,580
I'm a good pay piggy though no don't encourage her don't encourage her she's gonna hate me

26
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,620
well she blocked me so she didn't give a shit about me I can't believe it

27
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:38,220
streamer doesn't like me what am I gonna do oh well I guess ASMR collab with her is off the cards

28
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,180
hold on let me take my clothes off it's a bit a bit hot in here damn

29
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,780

30
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,500
find I'm cringe I'll do it one last thing to edit oh that's another thing oh I also fell into

31
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:07,980
like three collabs yesterday I like stumbled my way into three collabs uh I I don't know how I do it

33
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,380

34
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:26,300
haven't been able to get my little tentacles into and then I kind of accidentally stumbled into two more

35
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,060
because we were on the topic sorry this is just straight up yapping forget the game okay this is

36
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,020

41
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:17,180
all that so you need time okay um and then she's just like oh I wish I could no no don't don't

231
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,900
I'm used to getting charged 50 cents for a pee

232
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,740
that's outrageous it's amazing that she finds something she genuinely hates her accent comes

233
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:30,540
out and descends to Scottish rage real true I told my dad since Tottenham that I've been

234
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,900
I've noticed that I've got a little bit more like Scottish twang to me when he's here because he

235
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:43,900
has a much stronger accent than me here in the short um but he has a much stronger accent than

236
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,660
I did is anyone being sick oh get that cleaned up where's my Johnny's

237
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,460

241
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,500

244
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,220
right so what was my objective I forgot but if it's 30 I don't want to see if I can

245
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,460
guarantee a clean toilet oh yeah real to be honest I think it's not brain happy

246
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,300
I'm glad I'm sorry it's so skill but at the same time

247
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,580
hold on I need to turn this down a little bit I turned it down just a teeny tiny bit

248
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:07,980
I noticed at the start of my streaming I didn't realize how much I had to turn down the game sound

249
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,260
I have to all my games are played at like negative like 10 11 decibels type thing

258
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,900
this is what I see

259
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,980
how do you know what's going on is this the same coaster okay can we just pretend this is my park

260

00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:58,060
you're doing I don't I do different claw roller coasters it must be look at the path then but

262
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:05,260
like there's no benches for the people the smallest grid and can do and overlay and everything

263
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:11,740
where's the star it's just blinding there's some autistic talent right there pat pat there's so

269
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:04,060
like hmm where you this of course right I don't think we can actually manually build a roller

270
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:14,060
coaster yet you know that I think we actually can wooden roller coaster junior and look this game

271

281
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:38,700
some guy you can have a park right next to like another AI part and they had to like out do it and

282
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,940
the way they did it was they threw a coaster off into their park and the game registered it as a coaster

283
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:54,060
day um on the other part and it like plummeted their numbers or something are those screams of joy

284
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,780
or dread you have to find out yourself I scream on the other coasters I said what I said okay I scream

I don't know what they're expecting to think oh he's got food in his hand

340
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,980

01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:18,940
some of the horror stories i hear about theme parks is like fully grown adults just shitting

599

themselves rather like because they're like oh we couldn't find the bathroom so i shat myself and

606
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:15,580

2,800 2,800 2,800 i don't see it

609
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:43,700
It's shown me fears that don't, some people really are grown children, real true, um,

610
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:48,220
modern real cycles, special bicycle runs on a steel motor track propelled by the peddle

611
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,220
of the rider.

612
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:57,420
Oh that looks fun, oh my god sorry I would go on that, excitement rating, how is that

613
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:58,420
one less?

614
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,420
Why is that one more?

615
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:09,780
Intensity and thingy, well this one is cheaper and has more excitement rating, so who am

616
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:17,260
I to stop him, right, now let's actually do the proper passing okay, oh wait it already

617
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:23,260
has a proper queue, oh man I love the pre-built stuff, are you joking, I literally don't even

618
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:29,980
have to think, I love it, right open and charge a bit more, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

619
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:35,980
What about you, where's the, is this the entrance?

620
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:40,580
It's four dollars per roller coaster ride, what about you?

621
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:50,980
Carousel, let's bump you up to a dollar, um, wheel, wheel, let's bump you up by 50 cent,

622
01:15:50,980 --> 01:16:04,340
okay and then go, or should I just buy another coaster, I've got 2300, I'm tempted, but these

623
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:13,580
are all like low water tricycles, peddle tricycles with large buoyant wheels, oh no absolutely

624
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:21,700
not, I'm not doing any of that, don't ask me to do that again, observation tower, nope

625
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:32,940
what the heck, right, bump votes, single circular ding, dingies powered by central motor, no

626
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:37,420
I'm not custom building anything, I'm too scared okay, the pre-builds were safe but

627
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:42,620
they eventually become too boring for the intents, the extra 50 cents on the wheel cost

628
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:52,100
is to cover clean up from all the handies, what is going on, right, I don't, a monorail,

629
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:58,380
a miniature railway, I am not custom building anything, I do not trust myself, right, these

630
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:07,380
are going to be too boring I think, miniature railway, monorail, custom design layer, right,

631
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:18,660
I guess we'll just do it from there and save up for, save up for, that's a scream out of

632
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:27,100
nowhere, let's see what the guests are thinking, this park map from in is really good, I'm

633
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:35,420
not hungry, okay but what do you guys from over here think, I feel sick, sit down, sit,

634
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:46,660
down, sit down, sit down, no not that one, not that one, everyone sit down that gets off of

635
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:53,260
this roller coaster, do I make myself clear, do I make myself clear, sit down, stop pooping,

636
01:17:53,260 --> 01:18:02,980
I don't have enough money for janitors yet, sit down, no do not puke, orange, don't puke,

637
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:13,100
sit down, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom,

638
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:19,860
you're sick, you're sicking yourself, do I need to put a toilet outside the thing, if I put a

639
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:29,500
toilet surely, if I put a toilet, and we can charge people for you to puke, right, ha let's get,

640
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:38,740
I'm a mechanic, let's get, I've only got, you better stop watering anything, but one guy,

641
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:43,940
we should hire a mechanic and just have him on table, fix ride inspector, yep that's all good

642
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:53,420
with me, or all good with me, entertainer, no, I'll get another handyman though, because

643
01:18:54,420 --> 01:19:04,220
we might need a few to walk the length of the park, don't you dare water the grass young man,

644
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:16,660
no way she said I'm a mechanic, entertainer, hardly even know her, come on guys please give me an

645
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:21,340
ounce of anything, when you come up with this hilarious, but if I repeat it, apparently it's

646
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:30,260
not funny anymore, I'm a handyman too, shiny, are you sad that the 3d0 omni is no longer available,

647
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:40,300
what is that one, is that the white one, the main one, what's the omni, POV veiler, get, end up

648
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,900
getting a house and then we can all share the KU100 together, that's probably the only way I'll

649
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:51,740
ever justify such an upgrade, I don't think I can utilize it properly, has a terrible fun,

650
01:19:51,740 --> 01:20:00,460
pun you should be ashamed of yourself, the one with four ears, ew, I never looked at the one with

651
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:11,140
four ears, did I open this, I did, wait, that's the ride, oh that is so cute, reeflings you have

652
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:16,540
to take me on this raid, I'd actually really want to do it, sorry but the smack kind of thing, I

653
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:21,260
want to look at all the flowers as they feel a little drive-by, a little fountain going on, that's

654
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:34,020
so cute, oh there's like giraffes, oh this is so cute, you have to do it, that KU100 me, all six

655
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:39,140
of us jumping here at the same time, could you handle the table, would take you on that raid,

656
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:47,140
it's so cute, look at all the tulips, oh look at the waterbees as well,

657
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:57,220
why are you okay, oh he's watching the big depper, big depper is really good value, big depper,

658
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:03,860
could that just say what I think I said, the park is really clean and tidy, okay I'm glad,

659
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:12,420
carrying a map, I think, yeah I think I said what I think I said, which I didn't expect, what are

660
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:19,060
you doing, oh you're looking at a map, well you did help these like reeflings, it's been a while

661
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:25,860
since I've had some relief so you know, get ready for Twitter, so when I've caught up on my work and

662
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:32,900
I don't feel stressed, let me go for it, oh the Ferris wheel to get a view of the beach is so pretty,

663
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:39,220
okay, are we making a profit, although I'm getting nervous,

664
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,740
is there only one of those,

665
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:55,540
everyone walking, no not everyone walking up to the Ferris wheel, only to walk away again,

666
01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:01,300
they're like no we're not in traffic, sorry, okay people actually seem to like the mehorse thing,

667
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:12,580
people are digging the Ferris wheel, get in, big wheel is good value, I want to get off big wheel,

668
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:14,820
you're in queue for it,

669
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:24,340
big wheel is really good value, big depper looks too intense, I'm not hungry, big wheel is good value,

670
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:27,860
how about no,

671
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:33,460
Galapurs was great, oh that must be the name of the other ride,

672
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:37,300
that ride low-key fire, I've never been on these before,

673
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,060
so in Scotland it's called The Shows,

674
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:54,580
oh the one big stretch, it's called The Shows, I mean the Shows are in town, it's like these

675
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:59,300
kind of rides that they build up, like obviously it's built from park, I mean every ride is built

676
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:04,900
from a park, but it gets like built up and dropped every other week, and I'm like too scared to

677
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:11,060
actually ever ride anything from The Shows, I don't know if the signs actually do anything,

678
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:16,820
what sign, this sign, this expansion,

679
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:22,900
maybe, your park has received an award for being the tidiest park,

680
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:34,260
oh thank you, thank you I did it all myself, wait they're taking pictures of the ride,

681
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,460
I don't even think about that,

682
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:42,660
like if you put up no interest signs, they do work, my son died on a roller coaster, oh no

683
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:49,700
Inspector Craig I'm so sorry, and oh my god that would be your story, your son died on a ride,

684
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:54,740
so then you vowed to become an inspector of parks, so that it would never happen to anyone

685
01:23:54,740 --> 01:24:00,420
else's son again, but it never, it doesn't matter how many rides you inspect and get

686
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:05,780
sorted out and people that you theoretically saved, it never fills the void of the emptiness that

687
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:15,380
your son left behind, so sad, that's honestly so sad, your park's so tidy, you're working your way

688
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:25,460
up to the safest park in the country, let's go, whoa that is so, the stuff writes itself,

689
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:33,860
no entry signs specifically do work because that's coded in option, I'm gonna fart so I need to mute

690
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:44,820
I did multiple farts in one, I like how I had to tab out in order to do that as well,

691
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:49,060
so just everything went silent, even the game went silent to hear my fart,

692
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:56,420
whoo, it's fucking Rekin, that's going straight up, that's going straight up my nostrils, fuck off,

693
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:03,060
it's fucking minging, what's wrong with me, what did I eat yesterday,

694
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:13,460
what did I eat, I can't even remember, oh I had, I ordered full for the first time,

695
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:19,540
but I don't, I don't know, I ordered chicken full and I don't think you're supposed to have

696
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:25,460
chicken, it's supposed to be beef and it was absolutely minging, I'm sorry but I don't know

697
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:30,980
if they completely messed it up and they were making fun of me or something because that was

698
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:35,540
absolutely Rekin, it was disgusting and everyone on TikTok makes it look like the most delicious

699
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:43,940
thing ever and I'm like ew, I found it rather vile, so yeah, betrayed by your own, perhaps death

700
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:50,580
by your own fart, damn it, I smell like popcorn over there, how dare you use my, my scriptures

701
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:57,060
against me, are we investing again something, junior roller coaster, okay that's what I need,

702
01:25:57,060 --> 01:26:00,420
I need to invest in more roller coasters and then I'll just hike the prices up,

703
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:05,860
do you like baked potatoes, I absolutely do them for their pog champs,

704
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:12,260
baked potato, I've actually been having shrimp with them because I'm trying to eat more fish

705
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:19,700
because apparently it helps with your longevity and I'm like hmm, okay fine, where are these,

706
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:25,220
see these guests are actually having to walk like a freaking mile just to get into the park,

707
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:34,100
but we'll definitely, when that roller coaster comes up, we'll definitely be saving and spending,

708
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:40,020
have you seen the potato with the beans and cheese, damn pot, I'm so sure I'll break this

709
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:45,620
too but I'm from Scotland and we do, we share a lot of culture with the rest of Britain, yes,

710
01:26:45,620 --> 01:26:50,740
I've had beans and beans and cheese on a potato and it's good, it's lovely, I actually really

711
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:55,380
like it, I'd recommend it, if you ever, I'll tell you what, I'll make you,

712
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,900
Tadius Park, my arse, whose vomit is that, come back and clean it up,

713
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:06,660
why are we, why are we puking all of a sudden, what's going on,

714
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:13,700
oh I'll make you, oh right, we've got the coaster, right, we've got the bag, we've got the bag,

715
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:19,220
give me that junior coaster, give me that junior coaster, what we looking at,

716
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:28,260
Nausea Raton is so high on the crazy caterpillar, I mean I can see why,

717
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:32,260
however the excitement's higher so, it's 9000,

718
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:42,580
I don't have enough for that, it's 9000,

719
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:49,700
wait, if I don't include scenery, does it make it cheaper,

720
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:55,540
no, I don't have the money for that, I'm getting trolled again, no,

721
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:04,820
interest is super low, what should I just go to the bank, man I hate the bank,

722
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,580
gas and park, how did it go down, I don't know,

723
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:12,420
alone,

724
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:17,460
what,

725
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:23,780
did we say fuck it in my bowl,

726
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:28,340
right, junior coaster,

727
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,620
it takes up the whole park,

728
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:42,660
who, I can't,

729
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,820
I can't even fit it,

730
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:57,540
I would have to move the merry go round, okay, see you you e-bam,

731
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:05,700
how do I get rid of you, I build those the fuck out of you, clear that shit, can I sell it,

732
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:12,980
bin it, demolish, can't remove this, construction not possible while the game is paused,

733
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:21,860
okay, the people on the ride just gone forever, they'll never be seen again by their loved ones,

734
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:31,860
oh, I'm sure these people, yeah I'm pretty sure they could like walk back to where they're supposed

735
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,860
to go, right, you guys aren't like dumb enough that you can't see the big massive roller,

736
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:44,740
get off the tail, get off the tail, thank you, Jesus, we're playing musical tails over here,

737
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:58,020
what the, what are you doing, right, now we get the big FU one, okay, oh, sorry, I got a big say

738
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:11,540
there, that is so big, okay, okay pause, okay, okay, next, next, next, next, open,

739
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:22,180
first take the motherfucking price up, then open, and then profit surely, oh my god,

740
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:27,940
look at them like ants, wait, why does no one want to go on the ride, is it too daunting,

741
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:35,060
look at these ants, wait, everyone's too scared of it, are you too scared, I need to go to the

742
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:44,020
toilet, oh, oh, okay, I guess, right, if you need to go to the toilet, right, everyone puke right

743
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:53,540
there, and everyone get a fizzy juice, open that up, open that up, and then we're gonna put down

744
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:59,060
the benches, so no one puke, everyone sit down, and then we'll put the trash can, and then everyone's

745
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:09,700
gonna sit down, do you understand, sit down, do not puke all over my park, right okay, we're making

746
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:16,100
four dollars, do you still think it's good value, the crazy caterpillar is good value, oh yeah, that's

747
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:25,620
it, what about now, I want to go on something more thrilling than squeaky cycles, then guess what,

748
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:32,900
don't, smile, you want more exciting, what do you think of it, recent thought,

749
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:43,060
oh, you know, I've been queuing for our ages, well, I don't know what to tell you, it's really

750
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:49,860
good value, is it, thank you, thank you for your honest thoughts and opinions, why yes, of course,

751
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:55,540
what are you, I'm not hungry, this park is clean and tidy, Big Dipper looks too intense, okay, so

752
01:31:55,540 --> 01:32:01,780
you're not really bothered, that's fine, I already got the umbrella and a map, why would you buy an

753
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:10,580
umbrella if the day is clear, when the day is clear, I swear, go to the bathroom, you just walked

754
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:22,740
past one, do not puke on, oh, stop it, I feel sick, I'm not, I'm not paying that much to use the

755
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:28,500
toilets, this park's really clean and tidy, so because of your refusal to pay the price, you've

756
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:36,820
just muddied up my park and then complimented it on how clean it is, disgusting, Big Dipper was

757
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:45,220
great, it was really good value, oh yeah, was it, was it good value, okay, how about that,

758
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:53,860
peak telling me your thoughts, I am tired, we built a puke shed for you right there,

759
01:32:53,860 --> 01:33:00,580
it is a puke shed, that's such a good way to describe it, free bathrooms are easy ratings though,

760
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,100
are they, but they're making me so much profit,

761
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:15,860
what about you, is anyone, wait, everyone thinks that dollars too much, how dare you,

762
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:21,380
fine, I'll lower it to 50 cents, at least give me something for the bathrooms, don't puke,

763
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:31,700
hunger, oh my god, you're starving, I'm starving my park, yes, I'm so sorry, here, here's a chip,

764
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:39,780
right, everyone eat, yeah, eat right before the puke puddle, I'm sure it's really appetizing,

765
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:47,460
those fees pay to keep the park clean, ungrateful, literally, what are they playing at, I'm supposed

766
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:54,900
to have like 800 guests, I'm, I'm getting nervous, okay, guests in park, I think the objective is like

767
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:02,580
to have at least 750 guests in your park at the end of October on the second year,

768
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:08,260
right, my park ratings fine, but I assume you get more guests by having like more attractions,

769
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:14,020
that just need to buy, that just need to go all out on loans, well maybe if they stopped

770
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:18,420
puke and they wouldn't be so hungry, literally, why aren't they thinking of, don't be selfish,

771
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:27,060
what are you, okay, you're hungry, but it's going down, so you're fine, just eat, are you squidding

772
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:38,180
me right now, Tim's too damn, I mean, if you want to get technical, Amy's done

773
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:49,460
that, oh advertising, why yes, of loan interest, on flu, company value, park values,

774
01:34:51,220 --> 01:35:03,140
so what, okay, I can't take that down, vouchers for free drink, why not, go,

775
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:11,780
369 guests, I can't believe it, they knew what was going on, right, what are we feeling now,

776
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:17,060
what's our body, I'm not paying that much to use toilet for, well they all cost the same,

777
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:24,900
so shut up and go for a job, toilet, you're gonna shit yourself, instead of pay five cents,

778
01:35:25,140 --> 01:35:34,260
how about ten cents, you cheap bastard, you want to get off the big wheel, well good thing you're

779
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:40,660
not on it, no, no, no, we are not getting on this ride just to puke, you are not going past the

780
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:51,700
bathrooms, I feel sick, this path is disgusting, use the trash can, yes, right, sit down, stay seated,

781
01:35:52,660 --> 01:36:03,220
stay seated, do I make myself clear, stay seated, do not move, crazy caterpillar, star,

782
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:08,500
why does that get a star, what, you're gonna puke but you love the ride, I feel very sick, I need

783
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:15,460
to go to the toilet, I feel sick, okay, you just, a bumbly boot, why would you buy an umbrella,

784
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:18,740
I guess a star means, you can always drown them, don't forget,

785
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:27,300
then I'll get done for killing, wait, who destroyed the freaking benches, hello, hello,

786
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:36,100
benches can be destroyed, am I going crazy, I've never seen that before, do I need to like

787
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:46,260
breathe make benches, is that security, you have no security, there's hooligans running a muck in my

788
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:57,780
park, you better sort them out, right now, that's right, five nights at Freddy's, is this where you

789
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:04,580
want to be, I'm just gonna get it, why do you want to stay five nights at Freddy's,

790
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:10,980
Scottish version cover when, right now baby,

791
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:14,180

795
01:37:52,980 --> 01:38:04,100
deluxe version because it was gonna break, which is in Japanese, yeah, I am Japanese,

796
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:14,900
the best you're getting is a Hatsune Miku song from me, I'm so sorry, I'm thinking Miku,

797
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:22,500
Miku, health violation, restrooms deserve to be three, okay, and then why, what's going on with

798
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:29,460
my, oh I can just push the cursor to the edge of the screen to move the thing, right, in, in

799
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:35,060
memorial of Inspector Craig's son or Craig, I don't know how you say it, it's either Craig or Craig,

800
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:43,060
the toilets are now free, in the name of your son, I've been queuing for cycles for ages, what,

801
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:47,620
am I supposed to tell them to hurry up, what, what do you want, can I tell them to hurry up,

802
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:52,980
maximum wait time, what does that mean, wait for a full load,

803
01:38:54,500 --> 01:39:00,180
wait for any load, just send them, what do you mean a full load, just freaking send them,

804
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:06,900
um, oh so you know Japanese, why yes of course I do,

805
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:25,700
stop, that's not funny, too many guests, not enough rides, okay, okay, I hear you, I hear you,

806
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:30,660
I hear you, oh I'm at my max lend amount,

807
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:45,460
tell me, thank you Broly Living, Lollipop, Stroney would have been too powerful,

808
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:53,940
no she's gonna go, we need a water ride, okay, let's, let's analyze, I don't, I don't actually

809
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:58,820
think they've been, yeah it's making me, I need like pre-made stuff or it's not happening,

810
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:06,580
your marketing campaign for free drinks, but it did push up to 425 guests, I tell you what,

811
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:12,740
this is a very low energy ride, but we will make a profit on it, okay,

812
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:18,740
so entrance, exit,

813
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:31,300
and then we need the queuing one for the entrance, right, yes, oh my gosh, oh my, oh yeah Mr. Krabs

814
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:36,900
and then every, no not that one, draft, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,

815
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:40,660
all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, my baby don't mess around,

816
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:48,740
nope, just, just send them in, send them in, I couldn't hear,

817
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:56,420
and then number of rotations, that's fine, full load, any, I don't know, maybe a full load,

818
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:05,700
I don't know, I don't know, I'm just, I mean, sounds like it's time for scrambled eggs one to appear,

819
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:12,420
wait is that real, is that an actual ride's name though, there's a ferris wheel, no we already

820
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:19,780
have one, marigold round, canoes round boats, custom design layout, custom, custom, custom, a canny,

821
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:30,100
design, car ride, powered vehicle, road works, I sure hope it does, thank you, I'm sorry,

822
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:37,380
right, okay, we're gonna get one of those, give me a loan, thank you, okay, what was that just

823
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:44,740
looking at, was that a car ride, I was just looking at something,

824
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:58,020
one design available, wait, oh it's 5k, I can't afford it,

825
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:02,980
where is that thing I just looked at, miniature reel, wait, monorail,

826
01:42:03,140 --> 01:42:09,780
no, I've already got one of them, don't give me them, what, wait, I'm actually blind, it can't be

827
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:18,500
monorail, custom design layout, miniature reel way, what, what was I just looking at, monorail,

828
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:26,660
you are literally the embodiment of brain rot of the last 10 years, thank you,

829
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:31,700
I've never been more complimented on my life, you can even change the operation of some small

830
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:35,220
ride to have multiple of them, the queue is longer than the ride reel,

831
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:46,340
second row first column, car ride, right, no, I, right, let me,

832
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:54,580
excitement is both the same, intensity, sure, let's do this one,

833
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:58,100
is this face in the wrong way,

834
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:04,580
okay, wait, if it's, is this face in the wrong way, I think I'm, yeah,

835
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:10,100
that wasn't it,

836
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:19,700
I guess we'll do it like here, how do I connect this,

837
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:24,500
where do you touch the floor,

838
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:35,860
am I gonna have to build a ramp like a big girl, oh no, oh no, what have I done,

839
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:44,820
oh wait, it's there, honestly, right, first we need, right, okay,

840
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:52,020
so this is what, the waiting area, okay, so there's already a waiting area, that's the good news, build,

841
01:43:56,420 --> 01:44:02,660
okay, hold on, hold on, let me, okay, we just need to do a little bit, but okay,

842
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:09,940
can you connect these two, okay, you're not quite getting it, you're not quite getting it,

843
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:14,260
but that's okay, we're gonna get there, you can't remove this, construction's not possible, we'll

844
01:44:14,260 --> 01:44:22,180
pause, well, we just need to figure out a path, and surely this isn't going to be difficult,

845
01:44:23,140 --> 01:44:29,300
okay, build a bridge, okay, jungle racers, that's the only way to be called that,

846
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:46,980
what do I need to do, how do, hi, we're just currently trying to figure out how to do passing

847
01:44:46,980 --> 01:45:01,300
in this game, no, no, but other way, like that way, yes,

848
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:13,460
confirm, no, okay, build it, okay, I mean, okay, okay, okay, go along, along, along,

849
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:21,060
oh, all right, okay, okay, and then rotate, okay, and then we're gonna go this way,

850
01:45:24,740 --> 01:45:32,020
okay, and then we're gonna connect it to the path, oh, we did it, oh my god, that took a little bit

851
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:36,340
too much IQ, I'm gonna be honest, let's get you up to like four dollars, since I have to take

852
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:43,220
like an insane loan out on you, go, I don't need the safety checks, I just need you to go, okay,

853
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:50,180
and then we will put loads of benches, so everyone will sit down,

854
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:57,140
everyone will sit down, do I make myself clear, he will sit down,

855
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:06,420
he will sit down, everyone sit down and puke into the trash cans,

856
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:08,900
pervaded on your walk back from the raid,

857
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:15,860
let's just put some benches around for the people that need a little seat,

858
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:19,060
because you can't expect people to like walk the entire length of the park,

859
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:25,860
so that ferris wheel is bumping, god damn, we need a second one, right, we have now have a new raid,

860
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:34,180
the alun, oh, there's flowers, okay, water thoughts, people, water thoughts, recent thoughts,

861
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:39,780
nothing, honestly me, real, true, oh no, my rollercoaster, autism has been enabled,

862
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:44,020
why are you going on so many raids, raids,

863
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:53,140
okay, what are you guys doing, tell me your thoughts, I want to go on something more thrilling,

864
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:58,740
I'm no thirsty though, right, that's good, do I need to put, no, because there's like literally

865
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:02,100
food access right there, do I need to put a shitter off here, I don't know, maybe,

866
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:11,540
when the music stops and gaming is really creepy, you're just,

867
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:14,660
you're in a room with me and nothing else, you don't need music,

868
01:47:18,740 --> 01:47:20,740
actually I just don't hear any of the music,

869
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:26,980
I hear a bit of something,

870
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:35,780
I hear a bit, you've been invited to Inspector Craig's funeral,

871
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:40,820
wait, no, what, why did he die, I have a mechanic,

872
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:46,180
I have a mechanic, how did he die, boy, I had a heart attack,

873
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:52,180
Inspector Craig's sore, sore, we had a heart attack,

874
01:47:52,980 --> 01:48:00,260
a rip craig, it's either Craig or Craig, it's Craig in the Scots mostly,

875
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:06,820
F in the chats for Craig, rip craig, it was nice knowing your buddy,

876
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:14,340
okay, let's see what you guys are saying, I'm not hungry, I've already got a park map,

877
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:20,100
this park is good value, I want to go on something more, oh the maps are good value,

878
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,820
thank you, thank you very much, I'll be here all day,

879
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:31,060
imagine throwing up on a rollercoaster, the amount of days,

880
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:38,100
I've seen those horrible videos of someone vomiting and like the other people just accept

881
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:41,060
their fate because there's nothing you can do, you're strapped in for the next minute,

882
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:48,100
I'm not hungry, are you actually not hungry or are you just saying that,

883
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:52,340
oh no you're not, everything, oh you're happiness, you're not exactly ecstatic though,

884
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:58,580
not exactly ecstatic are you, well you are but you're thirsty, right, let's

885
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:03,620
assume you're gonna go over, is everyone thirsty in this general area though,

886
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:08,500
oh they are, okay, I guess we'll get another drink thing, even though the drink thing is like

887
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:19,300
oh, can, will it, off the map, oh it does, same price there at the park, yeah, where is that

888
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:22,100
can I not charge more than,

889
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:30,900
nah it's just that word, how are you guys looking, you're not that happy,

890
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:38,180
what am I so miserable for, he put a star on, assume it if the star, it means it made the

891
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:46,180
guest ecstatic basically, right no one's vomiting, oh but he's hungry, okay, if you're too daft to

892
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:50,900
walk past the, like walk past all the, right fine, we'll just put toilets up here as well,

893
01:49:50,900 --> 01:50:00,020
oh right, we'll put a toilet up here because everyone's gonna be pooping and pant alone and

894
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,540
right there, boom, you have everything you could possibly need right here

895
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:13,060
and the toilets are free, you're welcome, at the expense of, at the expense of our, our overlord

896
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:15,220
shareholders, the toilets are free

897
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:23,540
is this roller coaster stall even making that much money, I even know where the entrance is, you know that

898
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:29,700
oh it's over here, okay, let me, let me just do a little cheeky rotation

899
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:40,580
make it six dollars for a war ball to add to the realism, well remember this is the, wait

900
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:44,100
wait, it has a datatur,

901
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:59,540
the man who made this, his autism was on fire, literally what, it has a freaking

902
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:05,300
velocity altitude vertical Gs,

903
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:10,260
this man knew what he wanted,

904
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:15,860
he absolutely kicked, no wonder roller coaster type thing went far,

905
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:20,180
sorry but look at this, it's literally got a heart rate monitor,

906
01:51:22,340 --> 01:51:25,380
it's literally got a heart rate monitor, that's insanity,

907
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:34,100
look, the power of autism anything possible, look at that, boom, and he just, oh they flatlined,

908
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:40,900
oh, oh I'm sorry, right, I mean who wouldn't want to know the terminal velocity of each ride,

909
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:46,820
sure, wasn't there another amusement park singing, the one I played and just tortured people,

910
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:55,140
refunds are you okay, did I need to call someone, I mean trouble, right, we unlocked something,

911
01:51:55,940 --> 01:52:03,620
what was it, custom, custom, custom, custom, and then it went, it says this is 5K,

912
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:06,580
oh,

913
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:17,780
oh, I mean we could get it without any customization, but I feel like that's what people get excited

914
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:24,420
about, the scenery, I don't know, what was that steel thing,

915
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:36,020
steel chaperone, oh, ponytails, okay, is this too big for me, oh no, sorry I didn't need to build

916
01:52:36,020 --> 01:52:43,860
custom, I just wanted to see how big it was, oh we can actually fit it, okay, where's the entrance

917
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:50,500
here, yes, not enough cash, that's okay, okay, but we can't afford it, that's the good news,

918
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:59,060
we're not allowed to have any more kind of money, you know, if you named the ride after

919
01:52:59,060 --> 01:53:03,780
yourself, we would all say we wrote Strongly True, I'll do it with an X and have that,

920
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:09,220
I'll change the name to Strongly Broke Down, and before Strongly Broke Down, send maintenance,

921
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:17,780
will you play Zutai-kun, the Nintendo DS game, absolutely, I'm obsessed with it, I will force

922
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:22,420
you guys to do the whole campaign mode with me, I love Zutai-kun, and once it's set up,

923
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:25,700
you don't even have to do anything, like all the money just goes flying in,

924
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:34,660
I love me some Zutai-kun, right, well how much, we need 5K for the next steel thing, I feel sick,

925
01:53:34,740 --> 01:53:41,220
so sit down, stop puking everywhere, only have two genres,

926
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:50,980
stop puking right in front of the third stalls, pick anywhere else, go up over path and pick

927
01:53:50,980 --> 01:53:58,260
anywhere else, sitting down after puking all over yourself, get out of here, sit down,

928
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:03,300
everyone sit down, God you're like babies,

929
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:13,060
I believe I have to even do this, how are you guys looking, are you looking awful,

930
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:23,300
trying to like put it on the footpath but I'm not sure, it's not, okay, okay I see it,

931
01:54:24,260 --> 01:54:26,980
all right one more here as well, just for good luck,

932
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:31,300
Sony is really good value, Sony looks too intense for me,

933
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:36,980
stop that's so good, I'll definitely be reading your mind, right what are you,

934
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:41,620
the jungle racer with great right, but do you want to say it's good value or,

935
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:49,780
are you gonna tell me, I'm not hungry or thirsty, no you're not, you're just walking past

936
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:56,740
literally the hunger and thirst, what are you doing, I'm like caterpillar was great,

937
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:05,380
hungry thirsty, you need the toilets, you're fine, I need a few more benches, I think I might

938
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:09,620
actually need a few more benches, I don't want to make people walk for a long time because I'm

939
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:19,700
like oh I get tired too, I'm so exhausted, stop puking at the front of my freaking thing,

940
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:25,860
park is it that hard, Sony is too tame, invest in Sony, I've got 3000 right now,

941
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:38,500
we've got one, let's see what was it, it was a steel coaster, it was a steeple chase,

942
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:46,660
Raiders horse ride shaped vehicles which run along a singular track and it's 40,

943
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:54,420
4662, okay we're gonna stick it like somewhere here, I'm gonna have like a connection like

944
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:58,180
somewhere here and then if we want to expand we can maybe do boring stuff up this way,

945
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:09,940
me when I walk 0.1 centimetre, honestly what have I started, you can open a list of other

946
01:56:10,580 --> 01:56:18,740
recent thoughts, okay we will do that one, give me $400 please, with a cherry on top,

947
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:23,940
please, please, okay hydration check refunds, you need to make sure you're hydrating,

948
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:29,220
I need to look after you, I need to make sure you,

949
01:56:29,620 --> 01:56:38,740

950
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:43,860
and I love it, I love when numbers go up in video game, it's so easy in video game,

951
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:59,140

961
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:10,900
I love smoothies flips, legend, hey you can't call my wife that word, little sister challenged

962
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:19,780
shout and found out, literally, big bros, big bros are like, bet, unironically separate real

963
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:26,420
sibling relationship because they're like I bet, right where's the entrance, the entrance is like,

964
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:28,660
oh god this is really awkward,

965
01:58:32,740 --> 01:58:34,420
isn't that gonna destroy the bridge,

966
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:41,780
this, or is it, no, hmm,

967
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:46,180
maybe it'd be better if it was actually over here,

968
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:50,740
is there a room,

969
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:55,380
is there a room,

970
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:00,260
she keeps on under us to be in us, real,

971
01:59:03,860 --> 01:59:11,540
is there a room, hold on sorry, I need to check if this is skinny enough, I'm gonna see,

972
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:22,980
what, wait sorry I'm trying to, I need to think of where the entrance is gonna go,

973
01:59:27,140 --> 01:59:31,220
I think that's the best I can do, all things considered, right pause first and then we can

974
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:34,980
deal with whatever terrible mapping we need to do,

975
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:53,460
I actually can't even tell what I'm looking at, I said it's closed, right so I need to

976
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:58,900
connect these two platforms, okay we have an objective, we have an objective, right a bridge,

977
01:59:59,300 --> 02:00:03,460
shit, don't do that, don't do that again, okay,

978
02:00:10,820 --> 02:00:15,140
nope, nice try but, pull again, what,

979
02:00:15,140 --> 02:00:21,380
what,

980
02:00:25,300 --> 02:00:32,180
no, this one, yeah well that'll do, that'll do, I mean, no stop doing that pathway,

981
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:35,380
isn't that the waiting pathway,

982
02:00:35,380 --> 02:00:45,940
oh, we have to go up, oh man we gotta go bold,

983
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:51,140
wait go back one, yeah do that, wait hold on, go and then go up,

984
02:00:53,620 --> 02:01:00,020
yeah no you're supposed to connect to the pathway, oh man, oh man,

985
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:10,820
go that, right, I mean is it still like that, hold on, let me, let me just, let me just,

986
02:01:12,260 --> 02:01:14,740
why is this, right click to remove, no,

987
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:24,900
yes, okay, but don't give me that path, give me this path and then go up and then go flat,

988
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:31,620
oh my god, right okay, okay but hold on, hold on, let me get up, let me get up,

989
02:01:31,620 --> 02:01:37,140
I just need to fix this one over here because that's wrong and then,

990
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:48,420
okay, okay, okay, okay that, we did it, we did it, we have a new ride, we have a new ride,

991
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:52,180
it just took us a hot second but we did it, that's the main thing right, let's hike the price up as

992
02:01:52,180 --> 02:01:58,260
we always do and then open it, no we don't need to test it, I have full faith that everything

993
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:04,580
will go fine, smile and then play and then hopefully that spreads out more guests

994
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:11,300
and then things won't be so overwhelming for like the other rides as well,

995
02:02:12,260 --> 02:02:21,140
let's just put the trash can here, let's put loads of benches because we're starting to expand

996
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:30,580
that thing, what is the ride, I need to call it strong, where do I lean in at, oh it's all green as well

997
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:36,260
hey there we go, you guys ready to ride this one,

998
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:49,140
oh my god it actually changes the thing here, you can raid me, we did it after two hours,

999
02:02:49,140 --> 02:02:59,700
you can raid me, we did it, we did it, it only took me two hours, that was a lot of work to

1000
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:14,100
get there but we did it, where's the lane, new attraction, a burger bar, so now we offer burger

1001
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:27,460
yeah just put on top of the ride that thing, is the game trolling right now,

1002
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:32,500
I thought it was like all adjusted to the pathway but I guess not, sure why not shove a burger joint

1003
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:41,300
like right there, we'll take up the craze as always do, okay we have 500 guests, what is our

1004
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:50,740
timeline, I think we're almost there, guests in park 500 right and it keeps going off every month

1005
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:55,460
so we're doing fine, I just don't know about the free attraction, that's okay,

1006
02:03:55,460 --> 02:04:01,220
have at least 750 by October year two, we're not even in year two, wait are we going to be

1007
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:09,700
hanging about waiting for this map to finish, that's right make me money, why yes of course

1008
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:17,460
everyone makes me money, look at all those green things, I've become the big differ broke down,

1009
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:26,660
I hope I have an account, I do, okay he's been called in, okay September, we're in September right

1010
02:04:26,660 --> 02:04:32,740
we're definitely gonna be moving faster, I don't even know if we have him, we rode you in the last

1011
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:43,540
audio, don't get greedy real, I do too, the big differ's still broken after years, wait where is

1012
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:50,420
he, what are you doing, what is the big differ anyway, that's the caterpillar,

1013
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:57,620
oh that's the big differ, where is he, is he just like not in the park, go to your fucking door

1014
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:06,100
he was glitched out that time, is that what this is, if they're not like on the ground

1015
02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:14,100
okay the park's definitely losing the cleanliness awardee, joking with all the vomit

1016
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:27,860
but we still don't have all the guests though, okay hold on, what's the cheapest raid we have,

1017
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:34,100
probably what the big differ, sure let's just do everything,

1018
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:43,380
advertise campaign of the park, go for it, just send them all in okay, for a particular raid,

1019
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:51,140
do the scrawny, advertise scrawny, go go go go, let's get like 750 guests in here, okay and then

1020
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:59,300
we're gonna zoom, we're zooming, we're zooming, security guard is walking, he's walking, I think

1021
02:05:59,300 --> 02:06:06,580
we're gonna have to buy more janners, so the guests are at 300 though, hey sorry 650 guests,

1022
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:12,580
he's going up, I believe in you, Mary go around can never go wrong, oh we've unlocked dojooms, okay

1023
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:21,300
dojooms, what are dojooms, are they a wee raid, gentle raid, no dojooms you're getting bashed

1024
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:28,820
about, it can't be a gentle raid, which perhaps this is, perhaps the dojooms are the ones we made

1025
02:06:28,820 --> 02:06:39,540
along the way, D for dojooms, oh found them, what, oh my god yes, um where do we fit it,

1026
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:43,780
oh we can fit it over here really easily, let's do that, there's Rick

1027
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:55,140
where is the entrance, I really, okay that my only thing was be, I wish you could pause to like

1028
02:06:55,140 --> 02:06:59,860
catch off a little bit, yeah entrance, you made the entrance, okay there we go

1029
02:06:59,860 --> 02:07:09,860
and then exit here and then guests are complaining about the disgusting state of your park,

1030
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:16,020
check where your handyman are, okay well give me a second I'm trying to expand, I can't do this

1031
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:24,900
all at once, stop this madden, yeah do it like that so we actually have some time in case it gets

1032
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:36,420
really popular please, do that and then we can open dojooms but first we must take the price up,

1033
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:47,060
open, okay okay we did it right, disgusting state of park, okay let's get a few more of you around,

1034
02:07:48,020 --> 02:07:55,140
uh who's disgusting, who's causing the disgust, is it this right over here, be honest,

1035
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:05,780
where's the puke, this is just puke finder simulator, where are you guys puking over here be honest,

1036
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:12,980
no, oh there's a janitor that's maybe just, oh my game just crashed there, oh here it is, okay how

1037
02:08:12,980 --> 02:08:24,020
about you go I don't know and no do not do gardening I will cry, handyman, okay cleaning up,

1038
02:08:24,020 --> 02:08:30,180
cleaning up, why are we puking over here, what's going on, why is there litter, I have, I have

1039
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:40,020
fine well hire another one, hey you guys are, you suck, I do so much for you, this is why the

1040
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:46,260
shareholders are so fucked, we worked so hard, right bins, clearly we need more bins, I don't know

1041
02:08:46,260 --> 02:09:02,820
how but sure more bins, more benches, your marketing campaign has ended, disgusting litter bugs everywhere,

1042
02:09:02,820 --> 02:09:09,700
there's literally a bin there, where inspector create, he passed away unfortunately, I think I

1043
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:19,060
might buy the lord, your advertising campaign for scrawny has finished, whoa this is bad, I've

1044
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:24,180
been queuing for scrawny for ages, right well she's trying her best, damn she can't fucking serve

1045
02:09:24,180 --> 02:09:30,180
everyone at once, it's a single, it's a single use rate for a reason, single one at a time rate for

1046
02:09:30,180 --> 02:09:36,820
a reason, not single use, that's not how any of that works, one at a time for a reason, be nice,

1047
02:09:37,780 --> 02:09:44,820
right I think what we'll do is we'll invest in the lower excitement things because I think

1048
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:54,580
they'll increase the overall like people in the park, unless I'm just making that up but I feel like

1049
02:09:54,740 --> 02:10:05,540
I don't think I can fit a water, I don't think I could fit though,

1050
02:10:08,260 --> 02:10:13,220
no there's no way I can fit it, that's okay though, I tried,

1051
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:20,740
and I'm not demolishing that roller coaster, keep investing on scrawny, real true,

1052
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:26,500
I'll know if you keep investing in everyone else and deal with you,

1053
02:10:28,740 --> 02:10:34,900
alright I can't, I can only really do the wee rides now,

1054
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:42,340
right we'll put down the wee rides because I think it will increase overall park attendees,

1055
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:47,060
you know, and it's just like a small thing that doesn't really,

1056
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:54,340
it doesn't exactly cost like a lot to have or anything like that so I'm quite,

1057
02:10:54,900 --> 02:11:02,340
because I just hear someone hear, I might have, it's very possible, right build a wee thing,

1058
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:07,700
okay and then turn it on,

1059
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:14,420
but first take the price off, I did it the wrong way but fine, just take it off a little bit,

1060
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:22,580
get new attraction open, go go go, thank you Broly legend for the super jet,

1061
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:25,780
crazy glitches, you sound to me, time to make a custom coaster,

1062
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:32,740
I can't bring myself to do it, I can't, I'm too scared, stop this madness please,

1063
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:41,300
what do you want from me, what is another born ride, a gentle ride, a merry go round,

1064
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:48,820
do they have one, dodgums, strawnee, whatever that was, a little spinny thing,

1065
02:11:49,940 --> 02:11:55,060
god that one is making some fat, like I can see all them little pixels moving, I don't remember you

1066
02:11:55,060 --> 02:12:03,700
but we've got a ferris wheel round, a merry go round, okay I've got a merry go round and a ferris,

1067
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:10,260
I've got a ferris wheel, not a merry go round, oh my gosh, a huge respect for your most recent

1068
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:16,900
twitter short, did you enjoy it, I like showing the behind the scenes, I don't mind it, I've got a

1069
02:12:16,900 --> 02:12:21,140
few questions I'm probably gonna develop, someone was like how much is that in like youtube premium

1070
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:26,980
and I was like well because I do ASMR my youtube premium is a bit not this, can you move over a

1071
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:37,060
bit, my youtube premium will be different from others because I do ASMR specifically and yeah,

1072
02:12:37,540 --> 02:12:41,540
I don't talk about the behind the scenes but I don't know if people are like you're fucking

1073
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:46,180
I don't really want to put anything like

1074
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:55,940
just like put onto, that is ridiculous, can I just do that, that's silly, don't be so silly,

1075
02:12:55,940 --> 02:13:05,060
you're making me giggle, you're making me have a giggle, the silliness, twisters broken down

1076
02:13:05,060 --> 02:13:16,900
that's it, let's put that off a wee bit, it's just a nice calm gentle raid and then overall

1077
02:13:16,900 --> 02:13:25,540
hopefully it'll help have more people at least give me a bit of a chance to open it up please

1078
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:31,300
before you all start paling in, right so that's two relaxing raids across from each other

1079
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:37,540
and literally it's up to people, whoever what they want to go on that's fine, doesn't stop me,

1080
02:13:37,540 --> 02:13:43,540
doesn't stop them, thank you all for your voice because it's super chat but I'm

1081
02:13:43,540 --> 02:13:47,620
glad you like it, the park is designed to test your space management, well it's

1082
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:52,420
bloody working, I'm already ran out of space, I probably should have shoved this like way in

1083
02:13:52,420 --> 02:13:57,300
the back corner possibly, I don't know maybe we can get like some sort of skinny roller coaster

1084
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:04,820
next, I don't know what the game is investing in, it's just investing in everything

1085
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:18,500
right, scenery and theming, no, shops and stalls, no, water rides, transport rides,

1086
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:31,380
I enjoyed it very much, was a very brave piece of content, your transparency and business savvy

1087
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:40,100
is inspiring, um people were surprised and I'm like she you thought I wasn't going to be a success

1088
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:47,780
that sounds so arrogant please please I'm actually cringing at that, what I meant to say was

1089
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:55,860
I didn't have doubts, I wouldn't have invested if I had any doubt about like anything I wouldn't

1090
02:14:55,860 --> 02:15:04,340
have invested, simple as like there was failure is not an option, it literally, it cannot happen

1091
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:11,700
and I mean it didn't so, thank you again for the uh super chat of the voice, I call you

1092
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:18,180
Otter voice a second ago, I think I did sorry for the tea, dim posters crushed, is there no ride

1093
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:31,220
improvement research, um I guess not, I never saw anything like that, um it just says, who goes

1094
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:42,660
transport, gentle roller and thrill, I'm how much, research has taken 200, marketing is 200,

1095
02:15:42,660 --> 02:15:49,060
staff wages 1.3, food and drink, I'm not making a profit on food and drink,

1096
02:15:49,620 --> 02:16:03,060
oh to stock it, but sales are top, ticket rides are off, landscaping,

1097
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:10,900
no, no worries people are always under, it's not happy, eight of time belch, your dedication is

1098
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:17,460
abnormal, oh thank you, you're not, it's not the arrogant, you're confident, it's a good thing,

1099
02:16:17,460 --> 02:16:23,380
then but also I'm making strongly the best, a failure isn't an option, how am I here, you're

1100
02:16:23,380 --> 02:16:29,700
not a failure, don't talk about yourself like that you silly goober, if you say stuff like I'm

1101
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:33,700
right hold on a minute, hold on I'm gonna put my tin foil hat on because it's not even a tin foil

1102
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:38,980
foil hat, if you talk to yourself like that you will start believing in your, you'll start to

1103
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:45,540
believe it okay, so you know how it's like fake it until you make it, if you're nasty to yourself

1104
02:16:45,620 --> 02:16:49,620
you're not gonna have a good time, you need to be nice to yourself, I'm actually being serious as

1105
02:16:49,620 --> 02:16:55,940
well, like you have to say to yourself like I can like it's called positive affirmation, please

1106
02:16:55,940 --> 02:17:00,980
do not puke, sit down, oh my god sit down, don't puke, I know it's called positive affirmations,

1107
02:17:00,980 --> 02:17:04,500
either you believe it or you don't, but I'm not being funny, if you're poisoning yourself with

1108
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:10,900
the same poison every single day, you're gonna be poisoned you know, but if you

1109
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:18,180
do meme about and you know, say like oh you know what actually I'm a bit of a decent person or

1110
02:17:18,180 --> 02:17:22,740
like I do try my best, just because like you've done bad shit in the past, it doesn't mean you're

1111
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:26,820
unredeemable or some shit, like what the fuck, literally every, think of every video game you've

1112
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:31,140
ever, right get that price of the umbrellas up right now, hold on a minute, hold on a minute,

1113
02:17:31,140 --> 02:17:35,300
and wait why do I have two kiosks right next to each other, same price, same price, get them

1114
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:42,340
umbrellas up, 350s, unethical, but true, you were most likely taught to hate yourself along the

1115
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:47,540
way, literally think of high school, there's this thing called like, I think it's like the

1116
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:54,340
blooming flower theory or something like that, and it's like if you dare to be slightly different

1117
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:58,420
then the status quo, you get picked on, you get bullied, you get this, you get that,

1118
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:06,180
no more, no more, literally no more, like I get to be my weird self, you guys accept me,

1119
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:14,020
and I hope I extend that love and that belonging towards you, of like yeah you've got brain worms,

1120
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:18,980
okay, I'm not gonna hate you for it, that's just how it is, so let's see what we can do,

1121
02:18:18,980 --> 02:18:24,900
let's have fun, you know, let's give each other purpose if we can, or a sense of community,

1122
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:29,860
a sense of belonging, because like, you know, you're really harsh to yourself, I wish you weren't

1123
02:18:29,860 --> 02:18:36,500
as harsh to yourself, and maybe over time I can teach you, you know, to be nicer, kinder to

1124
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:41,380
yourself, I really like the neon color difference in the puke, that's really nice, I like the neon

1125
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:48,260
shade too, preach it strongly, took me years to learn, is that my eyeball, oh it is my eyeball,

1126
02:18:49,220 --> 02:18:54,740
it's not my eyeball, you take my eye, honestly I go through the phrase, don't be sorry, be better,

1127
02:18:55,620 --> 02:19:00,900
don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness, real, real, me when I come online and I'm like,

1128
02:19:00,900 --> 02:19:11,380
the girls said what, how do you know about my brain worms, who told you, everyone has brain

1129
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:17,620
worms, hell even I have brain worms, but I don't know, because I've just been allowed to do my thing

1130
02:19:17,620 --> 02:19:23,700
and be myself and just meme about, I don't really get, I'm like, I don't, I've said this before,

1131
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:28,740
I don't experience like, imposter syndrome, I don't really have any of that, I don't know,

1132
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:39,380
it's kind of hard to, I don't mean to, what's the word, sympathize and empathize, sympathize is

1133
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:43,620
when you haven't had it yourself, it's not that it's hard to sympathize, because I just, I'm just like,

1134
02:19:44,500 --> 02:19:49,460
so obviously I've just kind of preached about being nice to yourself, but because I know my

1135
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:53,940
limitations when it comes to content, I will never produce anything that's 100 out of 100,

1136
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:57,460
you know what I mean, like I'll never get a score like that, so what's the point of like holding

1137
02:19:57,460 --> 02:20:03,620
myself up to that, like I mean, fuck, I'm literally on a game that is what, two decades old, I couldn't

1138
02:20:03,620 --> 02:20:09,700
even learn how to do the paths at the start, am I gonna say it myself, oh, oh, I should have done

1139
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:14,740
this, I should have done that, no, I'm gonna giggle at myself and be like, haha, I didn't even know

1140
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:21,940
how to do paths at the start of this game, like, you know, you will judge yourself more harshly

1141
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:29,060
than anyone could ever look upon you, okay, and keep that in your mind, because it will, it could

1142
02:20:29,060 --> 02:20:34,820
swoop in and save you from just spiraling, you will only judge yourself as harsh, I mean, what's

1143
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:40,180
that Emmy mean, where it's literally like, you're too afraid to be perceived that you cannot enjoy

1144
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:45,300
life, like, or something, yeah, you're too afraid to be perceived by others, that you can't enjoy

1145
02:20:45,300 --> 02:20:50,500
your life, and it's like, come on, you only have one chance, oh my god, they're all puking into the

1146
02:20:50,500 --> 02:21:02,980
bucket, it's working, like, enjoy what you enjoy, sorry, but everyone puking into the bucket,

1147
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:07,140
buckets for everyone, everyone puked, I didn't realize they actually picked up the bin and puked

1148
02:21:07,140 --> 02:21:12,100
in it, I love it here, stream can't be lower than 10 of the person's streamers attempt, how dare you,

1149
02:21:15,860 --> 02:21:20,660
and get kissed, get loved on, how dare you, sympathizing is feeling bad for someone else,

1150
02:21:20,660 --> 02:21:25,220
is mis- empathizing, put yourself in, I thought you could only do empathy if you had gone through

1151
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:31,380
it yourself, oops, what's that, my English, my terrible English is coming back to haunt me,

1152
02:21:32,340 --> 02:21:37,140
and also, hey, I was lurking but broke it because you've got points, still suffering from

1153
02:21:37,140 --> 02:21:40,420
in real life responsibilities, so honestly, it's really good to see you in front of your hand,

1154
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:49,540
you'll be a busy bee, yeah, a busy bee, yeah, let it be nicer to yourself, and you can only,

1155
02:21:49,540 --> 02:21:54,340
only you can practice it, now you may be listening, you're like, yeah, yeah, strong, you're, you're,

1156
02:21:54,340 --> 02:22:00,100
you're, you're a strong slash, and that's true, just maybe be a bit nicer and just be like, oh,

1157
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:04,580
you know what, maybe I will have a good day, smile, maybe I will enjoy myself today,

1158
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:10,660
smile, where are you, what are you doing, oh, he's got a drink in his hand, you better not let her,

1159
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:18,900
later bug, oh no, that's not what this song, it just occurred to me that the song that goes,

1160
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:23,780
wait, is this song, let her bug, no, it can't be, let her bug,

1161
02:22:24,580 --> 02:22:31,940
you gotta go, boom, boom, into my heart, I do want you, guys be nice,

1162
02:22:31,940 --> 02:22:36,660
Englishes are setting language, Scots are the first, real and true, thank you British government for

1163
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:42,020
recognizing that Scottish slang is a different lingo, I will read you guys a book, that's actually

1164
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:45,140
Scottish slang, you know, love it, you guys will be like, what did I just read, and I'll be like,

1165
02:22:45,140 --> 02:22:51,620
hehehe, you're going to educate me, believe in yourself, and don't deny happiness to yourself,

1166
02:22:51,620 --> 02:22:55,620
find happiness wherever you can, love and happiness can be found in the smallest of places,

1167
02:22:57,140 --> 02:23:00,660
hold on a minute, I'm pulling up the quote, I'm pulling up the quote,

1168
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:06,580
I'm pulling up the quote, I'm pulling it up, I can't remember off the top of my head,

1169
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:12,740
okay, you ready for this, okay, the quote is coming,

1170
02:23:13,700 --> 02:23:18,900
and check her bug, you put the boom, boom, into my heart, wake me up,

1171
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:24,580
instead of great positivity or great negativity, I have great and different, hey look,

1172
02:23:24,580 --> 02:23:29,780
sometimes it's better to just be like, yep, this is life, than to be like, oh shoot, this is life,

1173
02:23:29,780 --> 02:23:38,740
you know, you know what I'm saying, right, time for the quote, some believe it is only great power

1174
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:46,180
that can hold evil and check, but that, hold on a minute, it's on the wrong screen,

1175
02:23:46,820 --> 02:23:53,220
but that is not what I have found, it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that

1176
02:23:53,220 --> 02:24:01,460
keep the darkness at bay, small acts of kindness and life, that's the quote, I want you to remember

1177
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:07,460
that, and no, I know Saruman isn't coming to killers or something like evil like that, I know,

1178
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:13,300
but I think there's a lot of truth to it, it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk,

1179
02:24:13,300 --> 02:24:19,140
like me and you little reefling, okay, have you killed anyone yet, no, I'm trying to be wholesome

1180
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:31,860
right now, are you serious, yeah, what Anonymous, what are you saying to us, Saruman, the stinky,

1181
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:35,780
please, I love that meme so much, Anonymous, what are you saying to us, you say, hi strongy,

1182
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:44,740
I'm honestly kind of jealous of you and the rest of you, I've always wanted to entertain others

1183
02:24:44,740 --> 02:24:48,740
and you six have found the courage to step up and do what I've wanted to do since I was a kid,

1184
02:24:48,740 --> 02:24:53,700
maybe I'll shake off the rust and get back to my roots, I heavily encourage you to do so,

1185
02:24:53,700 --> 02:25:00,740
when I say the term, you only live once, what I don't want, why the fuck is there a banana on

1186
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:08,020
the top of the chip shop, oh it's a chip, sorry, bit distracted, when I say you only live once,

1187
02:25:08,020 --> 02:25:13,700
what I don't mean behind that sentence is, oh my god, you must achieve absolutely everything

1188
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:21,860
you possibly could have ever wanted to do in this lifetime, no, what I mean by you only live once is

1189
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:28,740
give it a shot, give it a shot, I don't know if you've heard the theory that 80% of the work

1190
02:25:28,740 --> 02:25:38,260
is done by showing up and doing it and going for it, but that is very true and very real,

1191
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:45,220
I say go for it because what's the harm, oh no, right so what's the downside of giving

1192
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:52,180
giving it a shot, oh I might not find success, okay but what's the good things, you got to

1193
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:58,340
explore a hobby that you're passionate about, you got to expand upon your creativity of you

1194
02:25:58,340 --> 02:26:07,060
yourself that I've done, another benefit, you might find success, so if you're trying

1195
02:26:07,060 --> 02:26:12,020
to sell me on the down points of not pursuing your hobby, you're preaching to the wrong choir

1196
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:17,860
because this choir over here is singing like something else, I don't know what song we're singing,

1197
02:26:18,580 --> 02:26:23,540
okay I'm just a memer, that's what song we're singing and I'm just a memer,

1198
02:26:25,940 --> 02:26:31,540
you know, it operates on the same logic, if you write down your problem, you're halfway through

1199
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:39,620
solving them, yeah that kind of stuff, okay, you only get one shot, shoot, shoot the whoop, oh yeah,

1200
02:26:39,860 --> 02:26:45,780
yeah, banana, it's a banana, please tell me that looks like a banana, not a chip,

1201
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:57,060
you miss every shot you don't take, my friend who misses archery, 50% of it, for real, if you're

1202
02:26:57,060 --> 02:27:01,540
so worried just to dress up, makes you think it'll fall off and then go for it, literally send it,

1203
02:27:02,500 --> 02:27:10,100
send it, send it, people wearing it, reflins are wearing it, like you spent 60,000 US dollars

1204
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:16,500
to starve an agency, do you think I was sitting like stressed and over, send it,

1205
02:27:19,540 --> 02:27:27,140
send it, just go for it, don't hold yourself back, don't be the reason you hold yourself back,

1206
02:27:27,140 --> 02:27:35,540
darling, go for it, well to be fair you were very stressed out, oh well now I'm not stressed

1207
02:27:35,540 --> 02:27:41,380
out anymore because the girls are doing their thing, right, we're gonna zoom ahead because I

1208
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:46,980
would've achieved what we need to achieve, oh my god, look at all that sea of green, oh, a wooden

1209
02:27:46,980 --> 02:27:51,460
wail-the-mouse, get me on that, what is it, new raid attraction, wooden wail-the-mouse,

1210
02:27:52,420 --> 02:27:59,300
a wooden wail-so you're saying I have a shop in my-clam, yeah,

1211
02:28:01,220 --> 02:28:08,020
you didn't hear that, you didn't, for a legal reason, what, excitement right into the castello

1212
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:17,460
is insane, hello, oh my god we can fit it, oh my god we feel like you're gonna fit,

1213
02:28:18,420 --> 02:28:23,380
no, you're gonna slot right in right there, yeah, you're gonna slot right in for me,

1214
02:28:27,060 --> 02:28:27,860
why is it not,

1215
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:41,700
oh, that's the entrance there,

1216
02:28:44,660 --> 02:28:50,580
oh, let's do the path here, oh I didn't need to do that, but we did it,

1217
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:56,820
okay, and then then we need to open the raid, but first take the price up,

1218
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:03,940
who goes there, five dollars, I know it's a lot but the excitement is like insane on this ride,

1219
02:29:03,940 --> 02:29:11,300
I'm not even kidding, I can't text, all I hear is strawberries just screaming,

1220
02:29:13,060 --> 02:29:18,580
the house is right behind, well hey you will look fun, oh my, I never even thought about that to be

1221
02:29:18,580 --> 02:29:25,700
considerate, could you imagine every day all you hear is,

1222
02:29:31,860 --> 02:29:37,060
do not invade anyone, did you hear the big Scottish drama, I'm about to clue you in the

1223
02:29:37,060 --> 02:29:45,140
Scotland drama, so you know how there's Nessie, the Loch Ness monster, right, so she is like moaning

1224
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:56,580
or screaming at me, so Loch Lomond is where Nessie lives, right, the aquatic, whatever you want to

1225
02:29:56,580 --> 02:30:05,140
call her, and basically why are none of you going on the ride, okay, I've spent how much on that ride

1226
02:30:05,140 --> 02:30:13,780
and none of you are going for it, and the drama is someone is trying to purchase Loch Lomond to

1227
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:22,660
open up a theme park on it, and everyone's like, it's literally a conservation area for, not reservation,

1228
02:30:22,660 --> 02:30:28,020
sorry, a conservation for nature area thing, you know what I mean, that's what you're gonna,

1229
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:33,620
that's what your neighbours are gonna hear, no that's what the convention staff are gonna hear, amen,

1230
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:38,660

1231
02:30:39,380 --> 02:30:46,420
um so since you're a cutlery, so you get along with Nessie, obviously we're both aquatic and we

1232
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:54,580
love you, basically it was Johnny with her legs at the war, oh my god you've got me, you've got me, amen,

1233
02:30:56,980 --> 02:31:01,700
what is, um okay can I tell you one of the dumbest streams I wanted to do,

1234
02:31:02,420 --> 02:31:11,700
but I don't think I can, so I have been watching black churches on TV right, and it's so fun and

1235
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:17,700
energetic and I love it, and they all have a keyboard in the background, okay, so I wanted to do a

1236
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:25,220
confession stream, but it was like we were singing Jesus songs as well, that was going to be the

1237
02:31:25,220 --> 02:31:29,940
stream idea, but I don't know if that's really dumb and I shouldn't speak ever again, god everyone

1238
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:37,300
is lining up for this new, where are you all, you're all hiding like moments ago, I'm probably

1239
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:44,100
gonna need to add more toilets now I think, I would definitely add a shitter, okay there we go,

1240
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:52,660
we've got a shitter, open it up, a wreath stream, a wreath slay, that and oh and oh and oh, wait

1241
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:59,540
what's the name, August, confession stream sex on unspronied, do it you only live one, well

1242
02:31:59,540 --> 02:32:03,620
literally like I was gonna get you guys to confess and then we'd all have a giggle over it, a little

1243
02:32:03,620 --> 02:32:12,180
giggle, and then I was gonna like sing a song in between it, like I know that sounds so silly,

1244
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:15,860
but like I thought that was the best idea ever and I was like wait a minute, someone gonna be

1245
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:25,460
weird and be like oh you're making fun of this and I'm like no motherfucker, you're order, right

1246
02:32:25,460 --> 02:32:35,540
that's a drink, so now we'll do an ice cream, ice cream for ice cream, an ice cream for your...

1247
02:32:39,780 --> 02:32:44,820
I'm gonna be honest, if you heard me verbally smack my mouth, it's because I'm not paying attention

1248
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:52,100
to what I'm saying and it just comes out, okay it just comes out, it just comes out,

1249
02:32:52,820 --> 02:33:00,740
I literally, I'm just bichining, and my brain just goes for it, she's putting the ice cream

1250
02:33:00,740 --> 02:33:05,780
next to the toilet, oh my god do you guys remember two girls one cup,

1251
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:12,340
and then the big debate was like it's ice cream,

1252
02:33:14,900 --> 02:33:23,460
I remember the debate was like ice cream, why must you remind me, no, wasn't that, wait were you

1253
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:29,140
guys not like the debate of it, it was literally like okay I'm gonna have to hire another mechanic,

1254
02:33:29,300 --> 02:33:37,700
okay answering a radio call, okay I think we maybe need a second mechanic, I don't know how to

1255
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:44,260
see it but wait what broke down, who or what isn't moving, we're not, I don't know,

1256
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:50,980
and I'll just let him do the rounds, ice cream argument was just copied on, oh was it,

1257
02:33:51,460 --> 02:34:02,500
what debate, it was ice cream, the company that made it admitted to it, oh

1258
02:34:04,340 --> 02:34:07,860
I've never seen the argument and now that I'm picturing it I don't want to, I'm sorry,

1259
02:34:07,860 --> 02:34:12,660
I don't remember the debate but I remember that, cease okay right I'll stop, I'll stop, I'll stop,

1260
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:20,580
right we've almost finished the park, I am gonna update Azura and mine Patreon when I get off,

1261
02:34:21,060 --> 02:34:25,140
I know I said I was gonna do it yesterday, I'm so sorry, I'm behind everywhere but the girls

1262
02:34:25,140 --> 02:34:27,860
are being so patient and fantastic with me so please don't worry,

1263
02:34:32,500 --> 02:34:40,340
I just read that comment in chat, I shouldn't have started, anyway, oh look how many reeflings

1264
02:34:40,340 --> 02:34:48,660
want to ride strong, let's go, 86 of you are lining, 87 are lining up right now to raid me

1265
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:57,380

1266
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:07,700
talk about exclusivity, that's that big train, guys she's behind me,

1267
02:35:09,860 --> 02:35:16,020
but why is everyone digging this ferris wheel, is it because it has a view, what's the music for

1268
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:32,740
the ferris wheel, modern, I can hear hints of something, one coaster for each girl when,

1269
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:44,020
honestly my mind is here, really squeaky, reliability down time 6%, that's fine,

1270
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:55,940
minimum wait time so far, rock, no rock doesn't make sense for such a gentle thing,

1271
02:35:55,940 --> 02:35:59,860
let's not do that, what are you thinking, recent thoughts, no thoughts, real, true,

1272
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:10,900
queuing for strone, right, how do I read action thoughts, I feel sick, I'm running out of cash,

1273
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:17,940
I'm not hungry, I feel sick, I've been queuing for strone, this path is disgusting,

1274
02:36:19,380 --> 02:36:24,180
this park is really clean and tidy, so we've got a few contradicting things, that's like a stop us,

1275
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:32,660
can't stop us with our order, okay you guys are actually using the bin, a Christmas miracle,

1276
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:40,100
truly a Christmas miracle, right I think we're gonna need a lot more seats for how many people

1277
02:36:40,100 --> 02:36:45,940
we have, maybe a few more in the pathway and stuff, I don't want people to be like exhausted,

1278
02:36:46,260 --> 02:36:53,700
are you squinting me right now, what, in the vomit park, straight up rioting it,

1279
02:36:53,700 --> 02:37:01,060
and by it, haha well, let's just say, strone, thank you for the tip and honest, actually that

1280
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:06,820
just reminded me, in my most recent short, Arisa has like full control of the shorts that she makes

1281
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:13,540
for me, if you pause my most recent short, it literally, she put that copy pasta in it,

1282
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:21,700
because she's heard me say it, and I'm like Arisa, but it was so funny, it's just that and by it,

1283
02:37:21,700 --> 02:37:27,860
I mean my pimpus, like Arisa, I wasn't gonna see that for the first time and be like what, wild,

1284
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:35,780
okay I think it's safe to say that we have, actually we could probably pay a bit of our debt,

1285
02:37:35,780 --> 02:37:43,540
go, yeah okay, and then we just skip ahead, because we're done, oh look at that sea of green,

1286
02:37:45,220 --> 02:37:49,860
oh aren't you getting that serotonin, oh wait there's a ghost train attraction, hold on pause, pause,

1287
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:56,660
ghost train, oh we've got a pirate ship, I didn't even know we had that,

1288
02:37:56,980 --> 02:38:06,900
what's a pirate, a what, power monster shaped cars travel 3000,

1289
02:38:07,940 --> 02:38:10,980
hold on give me the loan back, give me a bag, give me a bag, give me a bag, give me my money,

1290
02:38:13,860 --> 02:38:18,580
ghost train surely it's not going to be too big that it won't fit, surely,

1291
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:33,860
I'll take it, I'll take it, I can't see, I can't see how skinny the path is, well I'll take it,

1292
02:38:34,580 --> 02:38:42,420
right okay first, open, next, hike up the price, buy a lot because the prices are starting to match

1293
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:52,260
each other, and then the path, let's, let's add it, I can't see anything right now, I think I did it,

1294
02:38:52,340 --> 02:38:57,620
okay, now this ride is getting completely ignored because of its unfortunate location,

1295
02:38:57,620 --> 02:39:02,180
like I literally cannot see it, but we'll just do the classic bins and benches outside,

1296
02:39:06,180 --> 02:39:12,260
and then we're gonna rotate again, okay one person's gone up that path, oh there's a big

1297
02:39:12,420 --> 02:39:29,380
scary boy on top, you're queuing for it, why, the thing should be on, are they actually doing

1298
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:36,340
a test run, I can't believe it, that's Mr Bone, the ride never ends, is it actually Mr Bone,

1299
02:39:36,340 --> 02:39:43,220
make a bank, yes I trained that ends with the wall, the ghost is after, is you after the ride,

1300
02:39:45,460 --> 02:39:51,460
this is a reference, like clearly do not know, right okay now we can speed it up because we've

1301
02:39:51,460 --> 02:39:58,580
done what the game asks, it said 750 guests and we're at 875, so I think we're okay,

1302
02:39:59,220 --> 02:40:06,500
Park rate in 945, not bad, it must be the vomit that's doing it, I can't believe it,

1303
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:13,300
the vomit's letting us down, shocking, if everyone could kindly stop, you're a king,

1304
02:40:16,100 --> 02:40:22,340
I've just noticed the people that are sitting don't come out of the animation,

1305
02:40:22,660 --> 02:40:29,460
0 out of 10 game, unplayable, unplayable, absolutely shocking,

1306
02:40:30,740 --> 02:40:35,140
slide is broken down, well I have two mechanics so surely one of them's getting on it,

1307
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:42,580
surely, big dipper is broken down, can everything relax please, please everything

1308
02:40:42,580 --> 02:40:52,420
relax you're making me cry, new rate, Cheshire cat, what is it, is it in the gentle one, no that's

1309
02:40:52,420 --> 02:41:03,620
a water one, Cheshire, Cheshire are you here, you are, how big are you when you're big,

1310
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:11,860
Cheshire you're too big, I can't have them,

1311
02:41:15,460 --> 02:41:20,420
we're all mad here Alice, I can't have them, he's too big, smell,

1312
02:41:22,340 --> 02:41:26,180
we'll finish our lovely park and then we'll wrap up streaming on VDirect okay,

1313
02:41:27,140 --> 02:41:33,060
dog jumps is broken down, that's what she didn't say, that's what she said, don't say it,

1314
02:41:34,340 --> 02:41:40,260
wait what did I say, what did I say, her once, I wouldn't, attention, hey,

1315
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:48,100
everything's breaking, oh no it's because we're doing months apart right, September, October,

1316
02:41:48,100 --> 02:41:53,540
so we're about to get the screen that says congrats you won surely, I've probably done something wrong

1317
02:41:53,540 --> 02:42:01,460
but yay, they did re-publish this game, still hasn't been fixed,

1318
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:12,260
well they better hurry up, where are you going, responding to crazy cat pillar,

1319
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:21,700
where are you, he's on it right, it's fine he's on it, he's on it like a car bonnet, right let's pay our

1320
02:42:21,700 --> 02:42:30,100
debts and then I guess we'll just go, twister is broken down, oh no I might actually need another

1321
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:36,340
mechanic, I can't believe it, have you tried open rcp too, I haven't, I have no idea what that is,

1322
02:42:36,340 --> 02:42:40,580
you did it, I didn't know you could win at this game, oh you get like a mission objective,

1323
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:44,180
just got here, I'm listening at work right now, sorry if I don't interact, no don't worry don't

1324
02:42:45,140 --> 02:42:48,180
how is it not being fixed, is he glitching out or something,

1325
02:42:52,580 --> 02:43:01,220
are Virginia real, are Virginia real, we're just going to have another mechanic down because I

1326
02:43:01,220 --> 02:43:07,220
don't know what is going on, all of a sudden everything's breaking down, right what is that,

1327
02:43:07,220 --> 02:43:15,540
look everything's breaking down, I think maybe when I speed up they're not, breakdown breakdown

1328
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:23,700
breakdown, whole park's bloody shot, right what's that Virginia wheel,

1329
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:32,340
what's wrong with me, a Virginia wheel sorry, the whole park is breaking down by not giving

1330
02:43:33,300 --> 02:43:39,780
me, don't believe her lies, Virginia is a silo, what it's not real state,

1331
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:50,980
a Texas tube, oh well I like it, can I get away with it here, why not,

1332
02:43:52,500 --> 02:43:58,740
crazy caterpillars in the way, how big are you, seriously you're so, oh it is in the way,

1333
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:04,260
I can shove it all the way in the corner,

1334
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:14,580
oh I don't have the money, give me the money, we're going to shove it all the way in the corner,

1335
02:44:15,780 --> 02:44:19,620
okay then we need to do the thing where I need to figure out the path, oh I just clicked off the

1336
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:27,460
door, it's a very buggy but a good kind of buggy, right okay bridge, click,

1337
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:35,940
hold on are you doing what I think you're doing, I don't think you're okay, built,

1338
02:44:38,580 --> 02:44:42,660
wait what do you mean it's in the way,

1339
02:44:50,340 --> 02:44:54,500
fuck you,

1340
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:00,340
fucking caterpillar in the way, I just spent all that money on nothing,

1341
02:45:03,060 --> 02:45:08,340
and it left the freaking construction behind, you stink, don't ever do that again,

1342
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:15,140
well what do you think about Virginia, not just the US state asking for a reform,

1343
02:45:15,700 --> 02:45:19,780
speak up, you mean you're willing to give me your chair,

1344
02:45:24,740 --> 02:45:31,460
what happened to chat, it's peaceful, it's a little menace, okay develop bumbly beaches, small

1345
02:45:31,460 --> 02:45:37,060
amusement park and a thriving theme park, your objective to have at least 750 guests, oh yeah,

1346
02:45:37,620 --> 02:45:43,780
oh yeah Mr. Krabs and the theme park is not worth, well it's not worth millions, maybe another time,

1347
02:45:43,780 --> 02:45:53,380
oh we did it, post, post game yapping begins, no, still hasn't been fixed, I don't know what's

1348
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:59,860
going on with the mechanic, but they're not my problem anymore, save, save, and then we're going

1349
02:45:59,860 --> 02:46:09,140
to do post game yapping, oh yeah Mr. Krabs, right I'll mute that and then I'll put my background

1350
02:46:09,140 --> 02:46:14,980
music on, but I'll still have it in the background, and then I'll go big to symbolize this post game

1351
02:46:14,980 --> 02:46:28,020
yapping time, that's right, we're like post game plapping time, oh you like that one, yeah you like

1352
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:39,940
the other big sweat, but yes tonight I'm recording pregnant with you ASMR, well strongy you can't

1353
02:46:39,940 --> 02:46:48,740
do that, why not, what's stopping me, you, you're gonna stop me, less likely than you think,

1354
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:57,140
no strongy you can't just post me ASMR, watch me, watch me,

1355
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:05,460
grain some old school rinse cake, I am doing it at the end of this week, if you want to play,

1356
02:47:05,460 --> 02:47:13,380
and by play with me I mean jerk my pintus, nobody can stop, stop being strongy,

1357
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:21,540
actually I need to get giantess artwork of Azura, I'm going to, I should get a comic

1358
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:26,020
where everyone's like comparing our heights, so like people can learn the lore of our heights,

1359
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:29,700
and then the last panels Azura being as tall as a skyscraper and all of us are like

1360
02:47:30,900 --> 02:47:36,100
we didn't know you could do that, but we do know she can do that, but it just helps kind of solidify

1361
02:47:36,100 --> 02:47:46,740
the lore of the girl, um, hi strongy, Nessie's in Loch Ness, that's why she's called Loch Ness

1362
02:47:46,740 --> 02:47:56,660
once though, isn't she in Loch Lomond, am I making up, am I going mental, isn't Loch Lomond

1363
02:47:56,660 --> 02:48:04,740
actually where, and it's like a misnomer, oh when is Azur's Donathon, Azur's Donathon is on Saturday

1364
02:48:04,740 --> 02:48:11,780
the 24th of August for 12 hours, it is a limited time Donathon, please do show up, I think all

1365
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:19,060
of us are going to show up on our stream at one point, um, I think also a few VTubers who have

1366
02:48:19,060 --> 02:48:22,740
been very kind to her are also going to show up, but I'm going to help her out plan at all,

1367
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:28,660
but please if you're able to show any support, even showing up, not monetary support, please

1368
02:48:28,660 --> 02:48:35,220
don't think you have to, monetary support, um, it's all going to be a hoot and a holler, I'm not

1369
02:48:35,220 --> 02:48:41,140
going to be streaming while she streams, so I'm having a short stream that day and then I'm going

1370
02:48:41,140 --> 02:48:47,620
to redirect into her, and then I'm going to show up in her stream most likely, so it's the Saturday

1371
02:48:47,620 --> 02:48:53,140
the 24th of August, her actual birthday is national goat day which is the 21st of August,

1372
02:48:53,780 --> 02:49:00,020
but the Saturday is the better choice, but we will start doing announcements

1373
02:49:00,820 --> 02:49:06,100
when it gets a bit closer to the time, and the Donathon needs to actually be solidified,

1374
02:49:07,940 --> 02:49:11,780
she gave me a list of what the bleeding hearts came up with, so I'm going to work with it and

1375
02:49:11,780 --> 02:49:21,380
then we're going to see what the response will be to the mock sheet, but at the end of her Donathon

1376
02:49:21,380 --> 02:49:27,620
she very most likely can move out, so I'm very excited for her to kind of level up as a content

1377
02:49:27,620 --> 02:49:32,180
creator, because at the moment I think it's fair to say she's a bit limited at the moment, I don't

1378
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:38,660
think she would disagree with me on the assessment, she's a bit limited, but with the capabilities of

1379
02:49:38,660 --> 02:49:47,620
moving out, then I think Azura is going to step up her game, no that it's not stepped up, she's

1380
02:49:47,620 --> 02:49:54,100
doing what she can in the situation she's in, yeah, Azura is big enough to carry us all, for real,

1381
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:58,580
literally you guys were like why'd you call her fondula bosom, like I already planned the giant

1382
02:49:58,580 --> 02:50:06,180
test boob artwork, okay, that was planned long ago, hello mommy, hi refling, I know you said you

1383
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:10,580
don't try games that you might not be good at, but have you ever tried playing a fighting game,

1384
02:50:10,580 --> 02:50:15,700
I have never played one, but apparently you guys can stream snip and tech in or something like that,

1385
02:50:15,700 --> 02:50:24,660
tech in, I would 100% get absolutely walloped in a game like that with you, I wouldn't mind at all,

1386
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:31,460
what, I can't stop thinking about how stinky you are and how I want to lick you clean so bad,

1387
02:50:31,460 --> 02:50:39,460
I'm the robin, what, no shivers for a week young lady, you have to be nice and right

1388
02:50:39,700 --> 02:50:45,940
for your owners, please make more sent play audios, I mean,

1389
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:54,580
you feeling the sent play, you like it, okay,

1390
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:04,580
whoa, wait, this is the same person, they sent three, that's my good girl, I say they slam your

1391
02:51:04,580 --> 02:51:08,100
survey, I can't read this, I can't read this,

1392
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:21,780
I can't, the message ends with you're gonna be a good mom,

1393
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:32,900
refling, refling, you're pent up, you need help, come to the convention like right now,

1394
02:51:33,380 --> 02:51:38,180
you need clarity, you need the mental clarity that that release will give you,

1395
02:51:40,580 --> 02:51:46,820
astronomy advises for us to send it and that's a challenge, you need help to send tomorrow,

1396
02:51:46,820 --> 02:51:53,860
question mark, oh wait, I actually have a question mark, hold on, I paid good money for this, tomorrow,

1397
02:51:53,860 --> 02:52:05,540
tomorrow, yeah, tomorrow, maybe, I just need to record the missing ASMRs that I couldn't record

1398
02:52:06,180 --> 02:52:19,460
and then tomorrow, you're doing cons, I don't know yet, I have the 12, I have the 12 anxiety

1399
02:52:19,460 --> 02:52:25,380
which makes things hard, I actually, I told the girls about my situation and they all said

1400
02:52:25,380 --> 02:52:30,660
they'd come and fly out to see me and I was like, I'm gonna cry, I love my daughters, they're too nice

1401
02:52:30,660 --> 02:52:37,460
to be, I explain to them like the reason why I get like severely motion sick and ill and all that

1402
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:44,340
is because I have spawn, a bomb, I have to be at spawn at all times or I freak out and I can't handle

1403
02:52:44,340 --> 02:52:48,900
it, I can't handle it, but the girls were really nice, they were like, oh we'll come and see you,

1404
02:52:48,900 --> 02:52:55,220
don't forget to thank the paper, no, no, no, that was outrageous, that was an absolutely outrageous

1405
02:52:55,220 --> 02:53:01,140
remark, can you believe it, that was bizarre, that was like randomly attacks you, walks off

1406
02:53:01,140 --> 02:53:06,580
and blocks you before, you can respond, I mean I wouldn't respond, I don't respond to anything,

1407
02:53:06,580 --> 02:53:11,460
but it was just like, I posted it because like me and the girls like obviously we post stuff and

1408
02:53:11,460 --> 02:53:17,220
we're like eh, giggle, giggle and I was like damn, someone was unhappy with that, that short,

1409
02:53:17,220 --> 02:53:27,620
I posted emerses like I'm recognizer and I'm like oh, oh, there's a con in person, no, it would have

1410
02:53:27,620 --> 02:53:37,540
to be Melbourne, if we actually do a convention it would have to be Melbourne, I'm sorry, I can

1411
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:46,580
hardly go anywhere, I already got so violently ill going to the airport for my dad, was she a

1412
02:53:46,660 --> 02:53:54,260
potential collaborator, no, not as far as I'm aware, not for me anyway, maybe they don't have

1413
02:53:54,260 --> 02:53:59,220
paypegs in urgent, you guys aren't paypeg, I really do not want you guys to start referring,

1414
02:53:59,220 --> 02:54:04,180
like I don't mind it as a meme, but seriously, oh that terminology annoys me, because it's like

1415
02:54:04,180 --> 02:54:10,500
that simp terminology as well, it's like can guys not fucking enjoy anything without being

1416
02:54:10,580 --> 02:54:18,260
like fucking criticised or like made fun of for doing it, like oh my god, oh my god, anyway,

1417
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:22,740
so that's me, I don't know about you and your thoughts about the situation as a whole, but

1418
02:54:22,740 --> 02:54:27,860
oh my god, can guys not be allowed to enjoy one single thing without being like made fun of,

1419
02:54:27,860 --> 02:54:32,340
oh my god, they can't even fucking breathe, anyway, but that's just me,

1420
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:39,380
okay, thought I'd send a joke to tear you up,

1421
02:54:40,420 --> 02:54:46,420
my beloved, oh he said the coconut from Elden Ring, what do you call a brand compromise,

1422
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:53,860
what do you call a band compromise of overweight men, picnic at the disco, slim knot,

1423
02:54:54,580 --> 02:55:02,020
nine inch necks, rage against the vending machine, diabetals, fed zeppelin,

1424
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:13,060
OB slash CD, obesity, instead obesity, instead of ACDC, nine inch neck as well,

1425
02:55:14,020 --> 02:55:18,500
mommy I'm at work, but the thought of you calling me a loser for letting you win in a video game

1426
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:23,700
is making me a squirm and mess, I love you, I love breaking you, ravelling more and more,

1427
02:55:23,700 --> 02:55:28,900
tell me more about you being at work and doing things you shouldn't be, but I don't encourage it

1428
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:38,420
though, for legal reasons, I do not encourage it, if HR gets involved, it wasn't me,

1429
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:48,420
what are you saying, what are you saying, squibblings, my little squibbling,

1430
02:55:48,420 --> 02:55:52,580
imagine if I was a squid, you guys would be called squibblings, any squibblers,

1431
02:55:52,580 --> 02:55:58,660
I'm squibbling my squabble right now, what does sound do reeflings make, it's not oink oink,

1432
02:55:58,660 --> 02:56:03,540
definitely grunts and whimpers, yes, not oink oink, but yes on the whimpers,

1433
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:15,380
that kind of, that's what, delicious, nutritious, not really, delicious, oh yeah,

1434
02:56:17,140 --> 02:56:24,500
don't call HR unstrongy, she is the HR, when one of the girls complains that I'm being too overly

1435
02:56:24,500 --> 02:56:30,180
bick, she will towards them, can't relate, sorry, no HR here, bye, sorry, your design's just so

1449
02:58:28,740 --> 02:58:34,420

1454
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:14,260

1459
02:59:53,540 --> 03:00:00,420

1460
03:00:02,740 --> 03:00:07,460
strawny please chill, please train me to enjoy loads and games, it's been stuck on my head

1461
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:12,340
and it's even better knowing I'm a sore loser playing video, I love you, what you want me to

1462
03:00:12,340 --> 03:00:20,900
train you to enjoy it, to know what happens if you don't let me win, I mean real true,

1463
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:29,300
I was wondering what's your take on artwork that's wholesome, that includes you featuring another

1464
03:00:29,300 --> 03:00:34,580
female chuba, and velour that you've collabed with, interacted with them, yeah of course,

1465
03:00:35,140 --> 03:00:41,620
it's absolutely, honestly all the fucking gloves are off with me, go for it, all the gloves are

1466
03:00:41,620 --> 03:00:46,900
off, you don't have to ask me permission for nothing, you don't need to ask me for permission

1467
03:00:46,900 --> 03:00:55,380
other than to eek, sorry I'm stretching again, hydration check dialing weakening,

1468
03:00:56,180 --> 03:01:06,740
it is, okay, I actually sounded like one of those screamo people, disrespect your sorrow,

1469
03:01:06,740 --> 03:01:12,900
dirt, ink, I don't want to know what happens if we don't let you in,

1470
03:01:14,900 --> 03:01:20,980
in both scenarios, you're getting r-word, I just want to say thank you, I haven't been

1471
03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:27,220
watching you for long, oh yeah, hi, but you are a really sweet and kind person and what you've

1472
03:01:27,220 --> 03:01:31,140
achieved has been amazing, I'm really happy for you, oh thank you for your extended happiness,

1473
03:01:31,140 --> 03:01:36,820
I'm so so kind for you to be happy for me, see that's called empathy and that's awesome to practice,

1474
03:01:36,820 --> 03:01:41,540
so unironically good on you for practicing empathy, if you can find happiness for others as well,

1475
03:01:41,540 --> 03:01:48,740
that's fantastic, I will do that in my education stream about being able to feel emotions through

1476
03:01:48,740 --> 03:01:53,860
other people as well, because it's important to surround yourself in an environment that you'll

1477
03:01:53,860 --> 03:02:02,980
thrive in, and surprise, surprise, I'm surrounded by my beautiful reeflings and I'm absolutely

1478
03:02:02,980 --> 03:02:10,660
thriving, I wonder if there's a correlation, it's almost like we're as addicted to each other,

1479
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:20,260
um yeah, we're proud of you for sending it and gifting us wonderful veal, I remember,

03:02:32,900 --> 03:02:38,100

1483
03:02:38,100 --> 03:02:43,540
like that, I want you to be happy, I want you to consume people that make you happy, that's a

1484
03:02:43,540 --> 03:02:50,340
veal or girl or otherwise, I ain't a jealous, that's not for me, that's not my thing, I want

1485
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:54,820
you happy, I want you to be able to de-stress, I want you to have some background noise that gives

1486
03:02:54,820 --> 03:02:59,700
you a little giggle, maybe makes you breathe air through your nose a bit faster, that's what I want,

1487
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:04,900
okay, you want us to eat your daughters, now eat your mom, me shee,

donut on the moon, I can't wait to move out so I can make all the contents in the world for you,

1494
03:03:54,100 --> 03:04:02,180
can you imagine it now, my little Ripley, oh, uh, bleeding heart, fuck, I'm losing it,

1495
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:08,020
I'm losing it, not yet, so it's treason then, Shawnee is a big woman, dude, I'm gonna cry

1496
03:04:08,020 --> 03:04:12,660
ashamed here, like, I'll step in, whenever the girls are offline for the day, I'll step in and

1497
03:04:12,660 --> 03:04:19,300
do a little segment of pretending to be them, how about that, Azura on stream, real, she dropped

1498
03:04:19,300 --> 03:04:25,300
at the end, refling heart, damn, you do a fine Azura, I mean, if I whisper I can hate it enough

1499
03:04:25,300 --> 03:04:34,500
that it's not Azura, the vealer house is real, yeah, she's in my house right now, Azura, why are

1500
03:04:34,500 --> 03:04:45,540
you so tall, Jay, Azura, like, I'd be looking up like this, hi, she's so tall, yeah, hi cuddles,

1501
03:04:47,700 --> 03:04:52,500
I just want to let you know that I can't incomlicit your voice, oh, what the fuck,

1502
03:04:52,500 --> 03:04:56,500
why did that sound like I have a kazoo on the end of my throat, what was that, did you hear that,

1503
03:04:56,500 --> 03:05:01,540
that sounded like a broken door or something on its hinges, that was my voice, I'm gonna take a

1504
03:05:01,540 --> 03:05:10,660
hydration check, what the heck, hydration, hydration, you turned into the chicken toy again, no,

1505
03:05:15,540 --> 03:05:19,860
oh, I've forgotten how I did it though, they're doing, would love an Australian Emmy,

1506
03:05:21,780 --> 03:05:27,940
how would I do that, what's wrong, big brother, it doesn't sound like that,

1507
03:05:28,580 --> 03:05:33,220
what are you done, you're out, she's not that high pitched, but for some reason, I think in my head

1508
03:05:33,220 --> 03:05:38,900
my voice is deeper than what it is, so when I try and mimic someone, I go overboard trying to mimic,

1509
03:05:38,900 --> 03:05:44,660
if the vealer house was real, they would need a HR department and they would be begging me to shut

1510
03:05:44,660 --> 03:05:50,980
up, because I like scurreme, I mean, you guys hear, I scurreme, my dad actually complained on the

1511
03:05:50,980 --> 03:05:55,540
Mario Kart stream, I woke him up while I was playing Mario Kart and I was being like, you're

1512
03:05:55,620 --> 03:06:02,260
supposed to let me win, he was like, you're so, I'm like, I'm sorry, I don't fucking have any idea

1513
03:06:02,260 --> 03:06:11,860
what the neighbor's like, what S stream, honestly, HR stands for huge arse department, I like that

1514
03:06:11,860 --> 03:06:19,460
one, I like that one, I like that one, I like that one, I've keeping that one, that one's mine,

1515
03:06:19,460 --> 03:06:23,780
thank you, getting reported to the huge arse department ASMR win, and it's just me sitting on

1516
03:06:23,780 --> 03:06:27,380
the mic, well, I've actually already made that, changing the title right now,

1517
03:06:30,420 --> 03:06:34,340
I just want to let you know, you haven't done much hypno content yet, and I'm already

1518
03:06:35,380 --> 03:06:42,260
pinches broken, please break me more and mold my brain, my pinches and behind, into your tie,

1519
03:06:42,260 --> 03:06:46,180
oh it's fucking over for you if you're already, but I like it that way,

1520
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:54,020
I can't wait to hear the jingle of the caller while you bounce on it,

1521
03:06:57,700 --> 03:07:05,540
I can't read that, I can't read it, do you understand me, hi Stroni, hi reading,

1522
03:07:07,060 --> 03:07:11,940
this is about the other question about commissioning artwork, oh yeah, I meant wholesome art featuring

1523
03:07:11,940 --> 03:07:18,740
you in a female literature that's not in the alert, yeah, yeah, I mean if we interacted with them,

1524
03:07:18,740 --> 03:07:23,140
then that means I'm cool with them, and they're cool with me, because if they aren't cool with me,

1525
03:07:23,140 --> 03:07:26,660
you publicly wouldn't know I've interacted with them, are you squinting me right now,

1526
03:07:27,780 --> 03:07:32,420
did your dad hear you yelling about how you were gonna, our word the reeflings for beating you,

1527
03:07:32,420 --> 03:07:36,020
and how you were gonna run a train on them after breaking into our houses,

1528
03:07:36,980 --> 03:07:41,300
technically yes, I woke him up

1529
03:07:43,140 --> 03:07:49,140
and he was awake and like watching youtube videos waiting for me to finish my streams,

1530
03:07:50,980 --> 03:07:58,820
so the answer is yes, he heard the ring fit as well, and I was like okay, rather cringe,

1531
03:07:59,620 --> 03:08:08,900
thank you tiny spiny for the hit, but yeah, yo, I wasn't here for the Mario Kart stream, what happened,

1532
03:08:10,500 --> 03:08:18,500
when I get angry, I sometimes make threats against the reeflings, and I'm a bad person for it,

1533
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:24,500
and I should be ashamed, but I can't stop, because I get really angry and they're just so cute and

1534
03:08:24,580 --> 03:08:32,740
adorable, and they need to let me win, and I start screaming in it anyway,

1535
03:08:35,860 --> 03:08:43,380
I can't read any of these, someone is, someone needs to release right now, because you're doing it,

1536
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:47,780
and marshmallows, I can't read them out, hey story, listening to you at a restaurant with a

1537
03:08:47,780 --> 03:08:52,660
fam, truly a hard challenge, just struggling not to squirt with your voice, also clam slam me please,

thank you eyeperror, brian, why is he saying beach mouse, is that supposed to be

1544
03:10:11,620 --> 03:10:19,140
mud on your face, your big disgrace, something else my arse on your face, we will, we will

1545
03:10:19,860 --> 03:10:29,620
face it, okay, I had a dream where we were kissing and I was so pent up, I woke up and

1546
03:10:30,260 --> 03:10:36,100
I woke up you, tasted and felt so good, I love you, I love you reefling, are you dreaming of me,

1547
03:10:37,860 --> 03:10:45,300
do I look like, how do I look like here in your dream, I don't, my dreams never work out to

1548
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:52,500
anything, all my dreams are nightmares from high school, all my dreams are like nightmares, I have

1549
03:10:52,500 --> 03:11:00,340
a lot of kittens getting heart dreams as well, I had a cat dream, oh my god, I had a freaking cat

1550
03:11:00,340 --> 03:11:08,580
dream last night, I had a kitten, no I had a cat that I adopted and it had kittens before I could

1551
03:11:08,580 --> 03:11:14,820
get it neutered and I was so worried about it because obviously it's very dangerous for cats to have

1552
03:11:15,380 --> 03:11:19,220
well it's dangerous for anything to give birth because you know giving birth is dangerous

1553
03:11:19,220 --> 03:11:24,980
and I felt so bad and rotten because I put her in so much pain, yeah, so this is, I have nightmares

1554
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:30,260
about like cats getting hurt and stuff, I don't like it, I love my poodles, I love all poodles,

1555
03:11:31,780 --> 03:11:35,060
I've never been so jealous of a cat dream, no I hate the dreams, yeah,

1556
03:11:36,340 --> 03:11:42,340
stronti, stronti is a true goth only nightmares, I never remember good dreams, they say you dream

1557
03:11:42,340 --> 03:11:47,300
every night but I only seem to ever remember the negative stuff which is always like cats getting

1558
03:11:47,300 --> 03:11:52,660
hurt and stuff and I hate it, like I'll wake up and I'll know it's not real but I hate it, I hate it,

1559
03:11:56,900 --> 03:12:01,060
I just got here, why do I look so cute as a reef on a screen, that's you in the bathtub

1560
03:12:01,060 --> 03:12:05,620
getting ready to sponge me down for the 10k is more screen, I don't really have dreams,

1561
03:12:05,620 --> 03:12:14,580
someone pointed out it's a sign of psychopathy, what, psychopathy, I'm sure you're right,

1562
03:12:16,340 --> 03:12:20,180
I rarely dream but when I do it it's getting rather weird, I only remember nightmares and

1563
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:29,540
dirty dreams, I think I'm too stressed to have dirty dreams, you're my dream, literally you're

1564
03:12:29,540 --> 03:12:37,860
my dream, I wake up, wake up, it's the first of the month, no, but like we send each other,

1565
03:12:38,820 --> 03:12:44,980
well I say we send each other, I'm gonna start using my alt twitter more, okay, I promise you just

1566
03:12:44,980 --> 03:12:49,060
need to let me cook because I'm a bit behind, I didn't actually expect to be so behind on work

1567
03:12:49,060 --> 03:13:04,260
when my dad visited but, ah, hi strongy, how we playing, alt time, I saw Mercy posted this thing

1568
03:13:04,260 --> 03:13:10,100
on her alt and I'm like I'm so ready to absolutely annihilate everyone by writing stuff like that,

1569
03:13:10,100 --> 03:13:19,220
like doing like small creative things like that, I cannot wait to do it and it's over for your

1570
03:13:19,220 --> 03:13:25,140
pentas, hi strongy, hi meeting, thank you for making Hypno themed ASMR this week, I hope you're

1571
03:13:25,140 --> 03:13:29,380
looking forward to it, I have to script it and I'm not looking forward to scripting it because I

1572
03:13:29,380 --> 03:13:33,460
get worried I'm going to mess up and then someone's going to be like eh you're not really in a hypno

1573
03:13:33,460 --> 03:13:44,100
you're just doing it for the gag and it's like no I like it, I'm going to the UK, any recommendations

1574
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:51,460
for what to do in Scotland as much as it pains me, I was like last week and Edinburgh has better

1575
03:13:51,460 --> 03:14:00,580
tourist attractions, there's the National Museum in Edinburgh and then there's also an art gallery,

1576
03:14:01,540 --> 03:14:07,380
it will probably take like three hours to do them both, like together, if you kind of want to

1577
03:14:07,380 --> 03:14:13,060
blitz through it, the National Museum is a lot better than the art gallery, if you're not really

1578
03:14:13,060 --> 03:14:22,260
into art but I like physical art, like the old physical art, does that make sense, what's the

1579
03:14:22,340 --> 03:14:33,300
most down bad thing you've ever done, before debut someone wrote a green text post, I said I'm a way

1580
03:14:33,300 --> 03:14:44,980
to work, I shlicked and I posted the evidence on my alt twitter, I literally like, I think it was

1581
03:14:45,860 --> 03:14:53,060
it wasn't even major, it was like eight sentences and obviously because of the stress of like

1582
03:14:53,060 --> 03:15:02,020
organising violour, I had not done anything for ages and someone made this like a really quick

1583
03:15:02,020 --> 03:15:11,140
post and I read it and I was like well that's enough for me to get started, that's probably the

1584
03:15:11,220 --> 03:15:16,500
most down bad because it was like eight sentences and it was just pixels on a screen you know,

1585
03:15:17,540 --> 03:15:23,460
like it was just words on a screen, it wasn't like it was a video or an audio or anything of that

1586
03:15:23,460 --> 03:15:30,100
nature, it was just words on a screen and it was like eight sentences, yeah I was pretty down bad,

1587
03:15:30,100 --> 03:15:39,780
not gonna lie that was like really down bad, dudes would see two circles and go hmm I'm only human

1588
03:15:39,860 --> 03:15:49,700
after all, I'm only a cuttlefish after all, imagination is so so much more powerful, real

1589
03:15:49,700 --> 03:16:01,780
true based, retweet, repost anything, true true true, I'd make you have sweet nasty dreams,

1590
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:09,780
if I was using my mouth on you will you sleep, no no mouth on clam, like two, don't say that to me,

1591
03:16:09,780 --> 03:16:18,500
no mouth on clam and I'm the one who does stuff to you in your sleep, not the other way around,

1592
03:16:24,020 --> 03:16:30,180
I want to spend a week inside of you, soft or hard, sleeping, working, playing video games,

1593
03:16:30,180 --> 03:16:35,220
eating, going to the bathroom, picking up flirries, you want to be in my tummy or do you want to be

1594
03:16:35,220 --> 03:16:40,900
in my womb, well if you be in my womb I can keep you in for longer, if you're in my tummy you may

1595
03:16:40,900 --> 03:16:53,700
get digested, I'm not gonna lie, we need to think of the logistics of this, oh thank you

1596
03:16:53,700 --> 03:17:00,100
Rilke Cadmus, I appreciate that, I'm just worried like because I've never had a big massive wallop

1597
03:17:00,100 --> 03:17:05,300
at it like I've enjoyed it in passing and all of that but like to actually make it it makes me so

1598
03:17:06,340 --> 03:17:17,380
nervous, oh that's something I have insecurity about, the quality of my hypno content, oh there's

1599
03:17:18,260 --> 03:17:24,740
my weakness, there you go, we were kind of talking about how like I don't have imposter syndrome or

1600
03:17:24,740 --> 03:17:28,660
anything like I'm not gonna get out with that but I don't normally have weaknesses when it comes to

1601
03:17:28,660 --> 03:17:32,100
content creation because you're gonna get what you get, I'm never going to be a 10 out of 10

1602
03:17:32,660 --> 03:17:36,980
but hypno content I'm actually a bit insecure about so there you go there's a little insecurity

1603
03:17:36,980 --> 03:17:43,620
that you can poke and prod me with if you really want, how much rent you asking for the worm,

1604
03:17:43,620 --> 03:17:54,500
oh for the whim, no rent for free, whim, a whole week no pillow, real, only wiefling arm, I do it

1605
03:17:54,500 --> 03:17:59,860
to you but you can't do it to me, you get a dorm loss, dorm loss is fine, I'm fine with dorm loss

1606
03:17:59,860 --> 03:18:03,060
that doesn't bother me at all, if anything I encourage dorm loss, yes yes yes yes yes

1607
03:18:05,620 --> 03:18:12,980
and it's your lore unfortunate by like hypno stuff, yeah I I wanted to try it that's what it's all

1608
03:18:12,980 --> 03:18:21,060
that's what strongy's all about, see I promise I'll I paid a lot of money for these I promise

1609
03:18:21,060 --> 03:18:26,580
I'll use the toggles okay I promise I'm gonna use them on the hypno stream okay so you know

1610
03:18:27,460 --> 03:18:32,020
and then if you need something a bit bigger to focus on then I can leave this in the background

1611
03:18:32,020 --> 03:18:39,620
whilst the spiral still goes you know okay okay back to back to being a cut of the stone

1612
03:18:39,700 --> 03:18:44,020
but it'll be fine, just send that hypno as much as it can

1613
03:18:44,900 --> 03:18:48,340
I'm only okay I will send it but I need to make the script that's the only thing

1614
03:18:50,260 --> 03:18:53,460
okay you're allowed to my whim for a week okay there's no rent

1615
03:18:54,020 --> 03:18:59,780
but you do need to hit the magic switch and say it because if you didn't know there's a g-spot inside

1616
03:19:00,180 --> 03:19:03,060
and you would be right at it

1617
03:19:07,620 --> 03:19:12,260
from the stream yesterday Azur's hair is green like Hudson Miku which is also why

1618
03:19:14,020 --> 03:19:22,820
Miku has a leak wait did they no they didn't they didn't cut nah they did not color code the items

1619
03:19:22,820 --> 03:19:32,020

1630
03:20:49,940 --> 03:20:55,380
wait until tomorrow you can tease me all you want you've programmed me so much it's literally difficult

1631
03:20:55,460 --> 03:21:03,380
to do a solo session without listening to I don't think it's sense I'll send it again just in case

1632
03:21:03,380 --> 03:21:09,060
I love how easy and effortless it would be for me to overpower and dumb you but I pretend to be

1633
03:21:09,060 --> 03:21:15,620
weak and afraid and that I have no choice to let you have your way with me what do you mean

1634
03:21:15,620 --> 03:21:21,940
I'm so strong my wrists don't crack at all when I open water balls your accusations are unfounded

1641
03:22:06,500 --> 03:22:12,340
thing above my head in that parachute game because I had to stretch the like device open

1642
03:22:12,420 --> 03:22:18,260
it was not possible skipped arm day literally I have nothing in my upper body

1643
03:22:19,700 --> 03:22:24,180
like if I'm having to beat you up you're literally getting kangaroo kicked I'm not even kidding

1644
03:22:24,180 --> 03:22:27,940
like I will jump up mid-air and then ping you back with both legs

1648
03:22:45,300 --> 03:22:50,580

1649
03:22:50,580 --> 03:22:59,380
back I'm like double or double or nothing here's an idea what if you have a stream where you tell

1650
03:22:59,380 --> 03:23:05,060
the reeflings you control when they ink but in the stream you tell them they have to save it and have

1651
03:23:05,060 --> 03:23:11,780
them do it next stream like if I did back-to-back bansley streams

1652
03:23:14,740 --> 03:23:26,260
hmm that's evil evil like a siren I'm a siren maybe just maybe

1653
03:23:26,740 --> 03:23:33,380
yeah that is evil and now you put that thought in my head

1654
03:23:35,140 --> 03:23:39,940
would anyone even want to try and get out of the head lock directions unclear inked everywhere

1793
03:40:04,900 --> 03:40:08,660
because like obviously we got a lot of flak on first booted up like folk were like oh my god the

1794
03:40:08,660 --> 03:40:13,220
infighting's gonna go wild mean where we're like literally in each other's dms like here's a picture

1795
03:40:13,220 --> 03:40:20,820
of my ass um and they're like oh there's infighting and all that the company's gonna implode or

1796
03:40:20,820 --> 03:40:27,860
whatever and it's like obviously because your first interaction could visibly visibly a velour

1797
03:40:27,860 --> 03:40:32,980
could have been like a negative opinion you can maintain that negative opinion without ever having

1798
03:40:32,980 --> 03:40:39,140
consumed any of us genuinely that's like a thing that happens like um I've kind of seen it on

1799
03:40:39,140 --> 03:40:44,820
amaranth if you didn't know amaranth gets like a hell a lot of flak and people will go watch her

1800
03:40:44,820 --> 03:40:51,780
for the first time and be like oh she actually like isn't that bad at all type thing and then

1801
03:40:51,780 --> 03:40:56,740
it's kind of like a repeating pattern it happens like public's opinion that i've never consumed that

1802
03:40:56,740 --> 03:41:02,660
creator can overshadow the actual creator and what they do and it isn't until you go out of your

1803
03:41:02,660 --> 03:41:07,300
comfort zone and consume a new content creator that you can kind of like challenge those like

1804
03:41:07,300 --> 03:41:12,820
impressions or um those thoughts that or things that you might have thought were true but then

1805
03:41:12,820 --> 03:41:18,500
like you're hopping stream and it's like oh shit let's play sonic heroes um and uh even

1860
03:47:09,060 --> 03:47:15,540
