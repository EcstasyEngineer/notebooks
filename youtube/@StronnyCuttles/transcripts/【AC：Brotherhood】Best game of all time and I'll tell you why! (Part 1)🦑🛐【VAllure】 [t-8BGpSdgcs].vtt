WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
I'm not happy with you, you know.

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
Yeah, I'm the life on, what life on that could be?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Alright, I need to get a chance screen.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I need to get a chance screen.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Why is my iPhone bugging the fuck?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Oh, relax.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
What?

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm bugging out.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Am I getting a chance screen?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Get a chance screen.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
No.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
No, it's not.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Scuffs already started, boys.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Scuffs already started.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Look, he's a, he has a thing.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
He has a thing.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
One minute, one month.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
I was there to do some, some business things.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
God, the freaking scuff is a thing.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
What the hell's going on?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
The tracker is hating me right now.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Can you hear me?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Have you all seen this?

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Have you all heard about this?

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay, I think I'm going to have to move the iPhone about because what the actual heck?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Can you guys hear the background music or no?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Okay, you can now.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
You can hear a bit of Assassin's Creed.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Good morning.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
My iPhone is bugging out right as a, I'm pretty sure this can do horizontal.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
So not sure why I'm going to absolutely not hold on.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm just calibrating, testing left.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
No, what the heck?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Can you not see my face?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Sorry, blame the technology.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
What's that?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
I should have used my loading screen.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Sorry, can't relate.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Couldn't care less.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
And something, something.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh my God.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Is it because it's dark in this room?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I can't believe it.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
I can't believe being a goblin in the dark is a terrible idea for freaking tracking reasons.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Hold on, hold on.

01:53.000 --> 02:00.000
I need to come literally on my hands and knees to plug in this light under my PC.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
This is nonsense.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Honestly.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Why can't you see me iPhone?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm out of the port?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
There are no keys.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh my God.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Right, anyway, I've got some good news.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
Well, the good news is I've got my first ASMR club coming out.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Right, I've got to lay on.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Right, I've got to lay on.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Right, back and back and back.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, that's snuffing those.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
Why can, can V-tube Studio not handle how you want them?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Why is that going?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Right, I don't think V-tube Studio works at all horizontal.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, fuck you.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
You stupid little twat.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
First of all, you little prick.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Can it, hun?

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Can it not, it can't go horizontal?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm confused but I'm ready.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
You know what, fuck it, we're just jumping in.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
I'll, I'll deal with the tracking issues once, uh, hold on, hold on.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Fuck it.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Okay, there we go.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm actually normal.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I don't know why the tracking bugging.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I'm covering up too much of the screen now.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
Who's ready for someone's house screen now?

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
I do believe Asakul is still streaming, so please do support Asakul.

03:25.000 --> 03:36.000
She's still streaming for a white Christmas.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
Uh, let me just check before we jump into that.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Need to make sure I've got subtitles on.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Spoken language, English subtitles on.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh my god, I'm such a real gamer.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Are you ready?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
AC is just ending.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh, does she be next?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I think she'd be maybe next.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Her god's EPS soldier.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Right, okay.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, actually this is some, oh wait, no.

04:08.000 --> 04:18.000
I, I did all my like, oh, latest, like tipper and all that if you did a donalink to me.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Oh no.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh, you know what?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Fuck it, we're playing Assassin's Creed, man.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Fuck the money.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I want to play Assassin's Creed.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Um, I wanted to say something.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I don't know if you guys would like this, but whenever we play a video game, obviously

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
there's names in the video game and, uh, as rid for a feature, but to like name people

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
and chat.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.000
So I want it to be like special congratulations if your name's Desmond, if your name is Sean,

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
if your name's Rebecca, if your name's Lucy, if your name's Ezio, like in the video game.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
I don't know, like maybe only the guy names make sense, but I thought that would be a

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
bit different.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Um, yeah, special shout out if your name's Desmond.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Uh, wait, that's right, you get a name by me.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Eh, there we go.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Eh, Desmond, that's right, your name is Desmond.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
I don't think anyone ever expects to wake up one morning and find themselves caught in

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
the middle of a war between two secret organizations.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
I know I do, but here I am.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
On one side-

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Can you guys hear the game?

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Better known these days as exturgo industries.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
They're in the business of control.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Politics, economics, knowledge-

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Hey Skull, hope you enjoyed your, uh, Tomb Raider, more like Whim Raider after I'm done with

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
you.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I'm terrible.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm terrible.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
I'm terrible.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Friendsly remainder, we don't have HR, uh, if you-

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Did you enjoy Whim Raider, you little E.P. polar bear?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I caught the start of you, shtween.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Don't worry, I'll tell you the lore that you're missing out on, cause I'm rambling on

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
the top of it.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Ohhhhh.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Oh my God.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Altair.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Not Altair.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Not Altair.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
The Templars wanted the location of something known as a piece of Eden.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
The HR made-

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Go out at night!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Nah, you're done.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Go away, manager.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Actually scare me.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
They actually can make me graduate.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I always have to be like, my views are not-

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
They do not reflect the agency, because my views-

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Mm-mm, they shouldn't reflect the agency.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Okay.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
I was hoping that would be the end of my misadventures.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I have honey tea.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
How are the snowberries?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Piece of Eden?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Eden D's nuts.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Okay, that was good.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
You're welcome.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Da Frenze!

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
My ancestors from their insolence, searching for a path forward.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Ahhhhh!

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But me!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I'm still here!

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Ezio!

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Ezio Auditor!

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Hey, that's from Assassin's Creed 2.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
We're gonna play that Lea-

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Okay, I'm gonna play all Eden.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
But we're playing Brotherhoods first.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Take me in between the views of the towns,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
just to not reflect the agency.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
True.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
This is my story.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Oh my god.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Okay, I'm getting ready.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Oh my god, I'm ready.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm so excited to fucking play with you.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I'm sipping my tea.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Tell me if it's too loud or I'm too loud.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
But let's be honest, I'm always too loud.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
If I'm too big, I might need to make myself smaller.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
You know that.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Would you like me small ewe?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Me.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
This is a police dog from Mario.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Let me hear.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.000
That's actually the full dialogue.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
We got it.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
We did the quick time thing.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
The bigger the better.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
No!

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
Oh my god, it's a horse feature bird!

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Oh my god, it's Oz!

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
We're Ezio!

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Serious hooded man.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Watch this.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
You're awesome.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Technical difficulties.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Oh my god.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
I couldn't.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
This isn't on Xbox Game Pass,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
so we're not getting any gamerscore from it.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
What's that?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Another reason to play this game later?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Gee, will it hurt?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
I have to tell.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
Oh, it's General!

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
Fun fact.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
So excited to play.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Who is Desmond?

08:41.000 --> 08:52.000
I don't understand.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
Oh, wait, that's not Italian.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Where did that Italian speak?

09:02.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm here, me, Ezio Alditore.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
This is my favourite bet,

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
because it always glitches out.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
The fabric always glitches out on his knee in the scene.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It doesn't matter how many times you play through this game,

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
like it is instance of new glitches going to occur

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
during the cutscenes,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
but it always glitches out on the knee at that cutscene.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
It doesn't matter how many times you play it.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Mario, what are you doing here?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Better to be left in the hands of the earth

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
than in the hands of man.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I can't believe the Pope fucking vanished.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Where's that bloody Pope gone?

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Where's that Pope gone?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Sorry, I'm drinking,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
and then it makes me do hypnosis.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
I'll just get so excited, okay?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Ah, we're being swallowed alive.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
A zirgian taste.

09:57.000 --> 10:05.000
It's already occurring.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Are we ready?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Are we ready?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Are we ready for the best freaking voice line from Mario?

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
Better to leave you in the hands of the earth.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Ah, it's such a good freaking quote.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
It's an entire anime.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
I was worried.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Quick, we have to get out of here.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Okay, so you can't actually jump up

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
if you do not engage in Eagle Vision.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
So we're already in tutorial mode.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
If you do not engage in Eagle Vision,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
the game will not let you climb up at all.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
But until you engage it.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
So we're playing Ezio Auditoria da Frenze,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
which means he was spawned in Frenze.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
We are already an established assassin, okay?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
We've just defeated the big bad evil in Assassin's Creed 2.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'll shut up.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Oh my god, right, okay.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
So yeah, we're Italian.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
So Babadabopi, oh, that was jokes.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
This up next part section.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So we're still in tutorial mode, obviously, the game.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
But the reason why I want to mention that we're in tutorial mode

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
is because the game perfectly is structured.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
He's created the sympathy of the only place.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
What you're doing.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh, that's another good thing.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
You condemn what you do not understand.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Right, so we can push people out of the way.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
Out of my way, out of my way, out of my way.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Rosary beats up your arse.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Leave me alone.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Away you go.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Mario will actually get caught on those people.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
It's quite funny.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
That's your uncle Mario.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Uncle Mario.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Okay.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
There you go.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
My arm would blurted his attack.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Now I want you to remember that pineapple.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
For no reason at all.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Remember the pineapple.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
All hail the pineapple.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
All hail the pineapple.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Okay, this next section is how you get one of the easiest

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
achievements in the game.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And it is perfectly sequenced for you to do so.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
So look alive.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
This is how you get the...

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
You haven't...

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
You're not to get hit.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
You're not to get hit.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Oh shit, he knocked them over.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Right, hold on.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
You wait for them to attack.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
And then if you perfectly execute all these men,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
then you get your first achievement,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
which I believe is frenzy.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
But if you do it perfectly, Mario shouldn't.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Unfortunately, the camera angles are a bit...

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
No!

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
I lost this straight because of the freaking camera angle.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Anyway, your first achievement is to kill 10 people in a row.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
You could easily do it at that section of the game,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
but don't worry if you miss it.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
There are many opportunities to do so.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
The camera angle will...

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Merce you up.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I was going to say,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Merc you up.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
The camera angle is a bit funny,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
especially when you're in between buildings.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It's telling me to follow Mario.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
You must also trail behind Mario a couple of meters.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
If you are right behind him,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
you will knock him off his coded path.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
The AI will fix itself,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
and he will go back on the path,

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
but you must give him space,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
or you will knock him off the rooftops,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and then you have to wait even longer

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
for this section to occur.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
But it's fine.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
It's not a bad section.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
This is to learn mostly rooftop moving about,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
how to get your agility sorted.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
You kind of get used to holding down.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
I recommend...

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Oh, see, that's another thing.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Sometimes AI say we will do something.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
When you tell him to jump in a certain direction,

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
it's fine.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
This game has aged beautifully,

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
and I believe this game came out...

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
2012.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
Skyrim was 2011.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Again, you can knock Mario off this

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
if you're too quick.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
You must be careful.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It was 2010.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Oh my God, I was a baby.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
I remember asking my dad for this game,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
and fun fact,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
my dad bought me the special edition,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
and it came in a special box.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
If you opened it up,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I had the Assassin's logo on it,

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
and you opened up the box,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
and the game pops up and presents itself, man.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
It was freaking good.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Here's another section.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
If I continue up,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
he does not move.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Are you ready for this?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
I'm going to...

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Oh no!

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
You can't progress.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
You have to go to the side.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
He is in a wall right now

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
in the tutorial phase.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Yes, my dad gave me it,

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
and I was so happy.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
I was so lucky.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Well, I'm a Sitma fish.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
We're holding the apple of Eden.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
The page doesn't load if you

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
click the link in the description.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Did I mess up my own donation link?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Oops!

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh, this is a beautiful song.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh, the theme song.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I think that theme is called

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Family Auditore.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
It's such a lovely song.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
It takes you to just your profile,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
but not the tip page.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Eepth.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Eepth.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Can management...

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Can you update my link live on the stream?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Thanks, management.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
So we are now going back to

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Montregion,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
which is the home of the Auditore family.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
And we've been introduced to cannons.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Finish my tea.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Look how much money.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
We have 53,000 Florence,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
which was the currency.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Florence, yes.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
So we are now heading back

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
from Il Vaticano,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Roma, with Mario on our little

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
horsey-worsies.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
And we're about to come back

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
to our family villa location.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
You can see that we've got the

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Brotherhood, the Assassin's logo

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
on top.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And we've also got

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
the Assassin's logo on top,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
and Assassin's is very famous in the village.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Because he's kind of the

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
back-assit.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Assassin's!

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Assassin's!

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
I want to meet him!

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Please!

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Enjoy your meal!

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
We are going to be home.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
These places just keep getting better.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Yes.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
So everyone's very happy to see

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Assassin's back.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Thanks to you.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And we also renovated this place

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
in Assassin's Creed 2.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
It's your sister!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Claudia.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Claudia.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Claudia.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm so glad to see you with my own eyes.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
The Contessa afford me to

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
welcome you.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
The Contessa?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Here?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
June, you're truly dead.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
She has a really, like,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
good but bad voice line at later

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
section.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
But it ruins it

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
if you've not played this game.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
So, we are assigned

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
three.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I repeat,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
three little side quests here,

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
and it just kind of shows you,

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
you know, you can walk around,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
you can walk around in the game.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
If you hold the trigger,

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
you will do...

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Oh!

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
A bit of degradation there, mate.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
That'll do.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Did you know,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
to say,

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
push in Italian?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Spingy!

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Oh, also,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
it shows a bit of a...

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
a bit of a slag.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
A bit of a Waman's man.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
A bit of a slag.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
But then, anybody, then, anybody.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
We'll make sure he gets his whole...

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Oh, that's actually Scott!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
A second teacher!

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
To say get your whole

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
means to

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
punk a girl.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Yes.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Sorry.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
No one in Town Watch

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
who's such a burden.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I am sure

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
it's the only self

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
to be proud.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
You know,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
he's this big.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Rizio Auditori

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
defends

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
it for Renzi,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
for real, for real.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
You?

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
The party

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
was supposed to be a secret!

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Well, that's what happens.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Loose lips and all that,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
both bottom and top, hen.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Several things.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Hey!

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
She is offering us

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
gratitude

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
and services

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
to keep her sealed.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
She won't be sealed

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
once I'm

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
in the room.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't know what she's like.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
So we have to

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
complete her first quest.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Oh, she's touching her chest!

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Nipple stimulation.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, it's always tomorrow

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
with you lassies.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
It's never now.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
It's never...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Like, come on,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
let's go behind the dumpster.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Always the motto

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
with lassies, man.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Can I trust them?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
The link in description

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
has been up to you.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Just make sure

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
in OBS

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
you have the audio set

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
to monitor.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Sure.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
I'll totally do that.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
One

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
out of

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
three

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
side quests, okay?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
So you're supposed

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
to do the flower girl

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
first, okay?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Because she drags you

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
into the villa,

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
like up to the villa, okay?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Fancy a shag

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
from A.C.W. himself.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Can I do an Italian accent

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
with the Scottish slang?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
Fancy a shag?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
No, I didn't.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
It just sounds like

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
fancy a shag.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
No, no toilet time.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Oh,

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Mario's going to murder me.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
I have lost

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
his favorite horse.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Ah!

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
You're tipping!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Wait, I didn't hear it, though.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
I see the tip.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I saw the tip.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I saw the tip.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Oh, hold on!

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Wait, I just bet

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
if you run ahead of the horse,

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
you can actually get the horse

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
first time in the tutorial section.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Keep running, keep running,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
keep running.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
And then if you're Prince Pampi,

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
aw, we missed it.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
You can get it

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
first time in this tutorial section.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
I'll open up

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
the stream elements

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
so I can see he just tipped.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Oh, my God.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
This frickin' horse

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
he always jumps around.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Get on the...

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Okay, there we go.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Horsespeed Tubers,

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
dominated.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Check.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Ta-da!

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
But you can't do that.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
World record pace ruined.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Wait, so did you guys

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
hear any notification

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
of that tip?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
I need to go read it.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Hold on.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Oh, my game paused!

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Oh, my God.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Such a professional streamer,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
by the way.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Stream elements.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Okay, stream elements,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
sign in.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
We hear it.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
You don't.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
I did hear it.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Oh, you heard it.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Was it loud?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I need to turn it down.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Oh, no!

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I don't have my login

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
for stream elements.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
I can connect it

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
to my YouTube.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Management that connected

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
to my YouTube?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Or is it...

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
No, wait,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
that doesn't sound right.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
No, it should be connected

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
to YouTube.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
Stream elements should be

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
connected to YouTube.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yes.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Yes.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Okay.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
If the stream goes down,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
it's because I'm a fanny.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Full stop.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
That is the same.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Uh...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Uh...

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Can I...

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Hey!

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Wait.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Uh...

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Wait a minute.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Uh...

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Right!

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
Why is it showing me

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
people subscribed

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
to the YouTube channel?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Terrible.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Well, it's good that you subscribe,

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
but it's clogging up

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
the frickin' thing.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Right.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Save.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
I see it!

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I see tips!

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I see snowpots as well.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Ta-ha.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Get it?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Anyway, sorry.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Thank you so much.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
6.9.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Assassin's Creed Battle Hood.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Thanks for playing this game.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Uh...

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Why are you re-thinking me?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
This is literally my favorite game.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Uh...

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Someone called Bajinga

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
works now.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Okay.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Congratulations for the four.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Thank you for the tips.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
I really appreciate it.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Uh...

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Right, okay.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
Straight back into the fun

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
with just...

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
You spend as much time in battle

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
as your Uncle Mal.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
My battles have already won.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I see.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
That is good news.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Arrivederci has...

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Arrivederci!

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Sorry.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Are you squirming me right now?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Right.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
So, you're like...

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
So, the next objective

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
is up there

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
and you'll be sitting yourself.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
Uh...

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
I am gonna have to really

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
annoyingly

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
walk up all these buildings,

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
climb them up.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Eh, no.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
The game is kind enough

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
to give you these sandbags.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Up the sandbags you go.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Right.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Why can I not hear notifications?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I'm actually gonna miss donations

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
if I don't have the sound on.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Just give me a second.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I'll just...

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Uh...

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Uh-huh.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
Uh-huh.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Yep.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
I know what I'm doing.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Uh-huh.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Advanced options.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Okay.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Advanced options.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Hear me out.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Hear me out.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
Okay.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Monitor.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Monitor only.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Monitor and output.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
That sounds right.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
That sounds right.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Um...

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Hopefully I'll hear it next time

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
if someone is...

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Wait.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I can repeat the donation

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
like a five-head.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Oh, I missed a donation!

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Anonymous said,

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
how's your day's drawing?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm fucking pop-champ.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Hold on.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I'mma test this if I can hear this.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Are you squirming me right now?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I hear it!

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Okay.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
I will know when people

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
are kind enough to tip.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Thank you for the tip.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Can you guys do 20 blazes?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
How's your day?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
You're squirming me right now.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
You're freaking poll-grows, man.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Can I write something agency?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
What'd you say?

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
About the agency?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Why doesn't it not display your message?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
I'll need to update that later.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I don't think I can do it right now.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Anonymous, congrats, congrats you lozoni

That was 50!

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Why are you giving me 50?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
That's a lot of money.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
That's like...

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
That's...

25:05.000 --> 25:09.640
I'm gonna be honest. That's a lot of money. You need to be careful giving me a lot of money

25:10.800 --> 25:12.800
Cuz I'll just spend on the girls

25:13.640 --> 25:16.320

So per SEO thinks he's retired after his escapades and Assassin's Creed 2 has ended

25:44.240 --> 25:48.480
Brotherhood's about to give him a very terrible wake up call

25:52.720 --> 25:56.480
So we're no getting the cannon master to fix the canons

26:12.000 --> 26:18.520

26:32.760 --> 26:34.760
Richard thank you

26:36.040 --> 26:42.640
Wait, why can't I open up the game now? Oh, I cannot be this bad, please I cannot be this bad at streaming

26:42.640 --> 26:47.680
Hold on right there. But now I can't see myself. Oh, you know what? You know what? You know what?

26:48.040 --> 26:57.120
Okay, okay, okay, I can now see the messages. I can now see myself and I can see chat

26:57.440 --> 26:59.440
So I won't miss a thing

27:00.120 --> 27:06.160
Surely won't miss a thing surely surely call me surely temples didn't call me strong. It calls

27:08.840 --> 27:15.720
Okay, I can see donors if I miss them I can see chat I can see Assassin's Creed

27:18.680 --> 27:20.680
Oh

27:20.880 --> 27:22.880
Are you squid me right now?

27:24.400 --> 27:26.320
Brove

27:26.320 --> 27:28.480
What makes you think I can even read that?

27:29.200 --> 27:33.600
It's your auditory the forensic has hit me. Thank you

27:35.400 --> 27:38.840
Joe Mikar I'll read it over after the sections

27:41.160 --> 27:43.160
I believe it

27:43.160 --> 27:47.360
Can I tell you a sad story actually really cried like I cried squid me right now?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.640
Hey

27:49.640 --> 27:53.440
Right, I'll read the the random Italian this person thinks I could think I can see

28:11.600 --> 28:13.600
Thank you for listening to my Italian

28:13.600 --> 28:15.600
Oh

28:15.760 --> 28:18.660
El car yes, well, I gotta give

28:19.320 --> 28:24.200
To compliment again on your heart love the accent by the way. How many times did you play the game to know it so well?

28:25.800 --> 28:30.920
The answer is I actually couldn't even count how many times I've played this game

28:33.280 --> 28:35.280
No, anything killing us is that breath

28:39.280 --> 28:41.280
Take a drink of war

28:43.960 --> 28:48.720
Did you saw my mother in Italian? Okay, one of my biggest pet peeves about this game

28:49.440 --> 28:53.120
The freaking cannons. So you see how the hit markers there?

28:53.120 --> 28:58.480
It looks like you're gonna hit it and the cannons are like way loud in this game. They're like far too loud

28:59.280 --> 29:01.280
They're insanely loud

29:02.560 --> 29:04.720
My my foul-ass breath

29:05.960 --> 29:10.560
The guy sounds like a Skyrim guard most video games reuse

29:11.160 --> 29:15.520
Voice actors, so you will recognize people over and over again

29:15.520 --> 29:21.160
It's very common if you work in a video game that you will be used for NPCs for example

29:22.080 --> 29:30.200
Or just miscellaneous characters all the time very common Skyrim is probably the biggest example of like the same seven voice actors

29:30.200 --> 29:32.200
Being used over and over again

29:33.080 --> 29:39.040
Other than Cicero and Skyrim shout out to Cicero and Skyrim can't remember the actual guy's name

29:39.160 --> 29:41.160
But goodness greatly

29:43.160 --> 29:47.920
He said hi my dear it's rare to see one so beautiful and so talented. Maybe you can teach me a beautiful

29:48.960 --> 29:54.160
Wait, you can't even speak English and you like my accent, bro. You're gonna be in for a shock

29:56.680 --> 30:01.360
My favorite oblivion line. Oh, let me retake that. Let me redo that in the left in the game

30:01.480 --> 30:06.640
Okay, we have now just finished all our three side missions. We have just handled the cannons. Hmm suspicious

30:06.640 --> 30:12.640
I wonder why we have also been able to ride a horse. That's because in later parts of the game horse riding is very

30:13.840 --> 30:15.840
Necessary to X

30:16.040 --> 30:21.400
To explore certain locations and it's just not possible on foot is partly you can do it

30:21.400 --> 30:23.400
but it just takes up so much time and

30:23.960 --> 30:30.320
We also help the lady which established that it's a auditory is a bit of a bit of a ladies man

30:30.320 --> 30:34.760
And he's out for ladies holes. I mean we're all out for the ladies hole at the end of the day

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
Hey, hold

30:37.760 --> 30:39.760
This is outrageous

30:40.520 --> 30:43.020
By Zura by Zura by Zura

30:45.400 --> 30:49.680
There are two major hubs of English voice actors to go from

30:50.640 --> 30:54.720
So this is Katarina sports. She is a real person

30:55.920 --> 31:00.160
Did occur a very badass personality

31:02.200 --> 31:04.200
Based on a real person

31:05.440 --> 31:09.360
We're like Katarina do Fanny cuz we're getting her

31:11.880 --> 31:13.880
That's her mummy

31:14.920 --> 31:18.040
That's Marquia Valley recurring character

31:23.320 --> 31:27.400
I wish I could show you the magic she performed very good

31:35.600 --> 31:38.040
Moving painting of the goddess Minerva spoke

31:39.200 --> 31:42.480
Don't have a terrible tragedy to befall mankind in the future

31:43.280 --> 31:46.560
Give hope of lost temple that will provide a to humanity

31:47.960 --> 31:52.160
Then she called out to a phantom desmond as if you were there

31:55.240 --> 31:57.960
After her warning she vanished

31:57.960 --> 31:59.960
I

32:00.840 --> 32:02.840
Cannot imagine such wonders

32:03.840 --> 32:07.600
Did not house the terrible wet food fear this is good news

32:10.240 --> 32:14.720
Did she appear human yes, but her words proved otherwise

32:15.600 --> 32:22.880
All of her kind died many years ago. I wish I could show you the magic she performed all of the good delivery good delivery

32:23.760 --> 32:26.240
Where are these temples Minerva spoke up?

32:27.040 --> 32:30.400
Do not know perhaps we must search for them

32:31.320 --> 32:37.800
Tell me how it ended for you did Rodrigo beg forgiveness. Make excuses from his power

32:38.840 --> 32:44.120
No, none of those things the script pulled off another one. I got you pulled up another

32:47.400 --> 32:51.160
Just watching the mirror on her the spaniards

32:52.040 --> 32:54.040
Oh

32:55.680 --> 32:57.680
Some of the voicelines are a bit goofy

33:16.480 --> 33:18.600
Damn straight you don't come Mario here real one

33:21.160 --> 33:23.160
That's me your uncle Mary

33:29.360 --> 33:35.640
Maria auditory as your mummy big mummy kins. Did you know actually that's a bit sad

33:35.640 --> 33:43.360
Maybe not and we'll just continue to the next part of the sequence. Oh, right ready everyone group session right now everyone get out

33:43.480 --> 33:52.000
Not for this bit the bit that follows after hold on

33:56.280 --> 33:58.120
Wait for it wait for it

33:58.120 --> 34:02.000
See this is what happens when you pay for the premium pass at the VL or meet and greet booth

34:02.400 --> 34:08.120
You're presented with a bathtub and then this part is me. That's you okay. That's you in the bathtub. This next bit is me

34:10.120 --> 34:12.120
Yeah

34:13.360 --> 34:16.160
Oh, this for a hundred dollars for the premium pass. Yes, please

34:17.600 --> 34:19.600
Coming at you in my bikini

34:20.720 --> 34:27.280
Welcome home reflin in my accent. Obviously. I'll have to play really put on my accent. Welcome home reflin

34:28.720 --> 34:30.720
Mom is

34:44.120 --> 34:49.040
Do you think a con we would let us have a meet a booth that would be hilarious

34:50.320 --> 34:52.720
Forgot about that part of the scene. Oh, oh

34:53.600 --> 34:57.960
Like what happens in the ASMR booth stays in the ASMR booth everyone sh okay

35:00.240 --> 35:07.080
Fun fact I played this game in front of my mom and she was mortified at this scene because I was very very young

35:07.720 --> 35:12.600
And I remember playing it at midnight and I had the dining room chair in front of the TV

35:13.360 --> 35:15.360
My mom let me play it on the big TV

35:16.240 --> 35:20.640
And she was like, what are you playing now? Like it's a sad that's great

35:21.760 --> 35:24.760
Mom, please. I didn't make the game

35:27.760 --> 35:32.800
One should always have the freedom to choose. Oh so salty so salty

35:32.800 --> 35:45.200
Yeah, damn train and exercise is out of control

35:49.680 --> 35:51.680
Put in the ass

35:54.880 --> 35:57.040
Actually, that's another side note

35:57.040 --> 35:59.240
I remember why my dad needed to spell

35:59.560 --> 36:03.320
Oh, I was telling my dad about like some of my favorite games of all time like a couple of years back now

36:03.480 --> 36:08.520
He was like, how do you spell assassin? I was like ass ass in and we both looked at each other like that shrek meme like

36:09.400 --> 36:11.400
Like burst out laughing

36:13.080 --> 36:15.080
Such children honestly

36:20.040 --> 36:24.840
I'm not I'm not gonna lie if I felt like that my ankles would be gone. They would be dust

36:25.640 --> 36:35.240
Okay, this is the worst part of the game that's about to come up because you can do everything right and the game will still fail you

36:37.960 --> 36:39.960
So Mario has the apple of Eden

36:50.920 --> 36:54.440
The one Italian like oh my god, she really likes assassins

36:54.920 --> 36:56.920
My goodness

36:57.960 --> 37:03.400
Uh to say help and uh, oh no, we lost our monies. It's not about the money money money

37:04.600 --> 37:07.000
Forget about the money money money

37:07.960 --> 37:13.240
Uh, you do not actually have to do anything the horse will automatically run for you in this sequence

37:13.240 --> 37:15.240
So

37:20.680 --> 37:26.360
The entire town is now being absolutely destroyed and raided and I'm currently singing that one Scottish song

37:31.560 --> 37:33.960
All the horses get back up in this video game

37:33.960 --> 37:37.960
I just what for anyone who doesn't like when the horses go down and with you with that

37:38.520 --> 37:41.960
The horses always stand back up in video in this video game

37:41.960 --> 37:45.960
No horse ever stays down even if it's been attacked if it's been hurt la la la la

37:46.760 --> 37:49.640
Okay, this is the part I hate you can destroy

37:50.200 --> 37:55.880
All the cannons and all the freaking towns people won't escape and you can fail the section

37:56.200 --> 37:58.200
I have done it consecutively

37:58.440 --> 38:01.160
All you have to do is destroy the cannons ignore everything else

38:01.160 --> 38:05.400
But the freaking it's really hard to tell. Yeah, see I should have hit that third one

38:05.480 --> 38:11.000
But it's really hard to tell like with the edges of like the radius your

38:12.200 --> 38:16.440
Area of effect if you will and my goodness gravy it's frustrating

38:19.080 --> 38:22.600
No horses were harmed in the production of this video game. No, they're not so

38:23.080 --> 38:25.080
Please don't worry. All horses get back up

38:26.760 --> 38:32.600
The aoe area of effect is it's so freaking hard to tell because you could perfectly angle it and you're like

38:32.600 --> 38:34.600
I should have three but yeah

38:35.480 --> 38:37.960
And especially the ones on the hill this oh

38:38.600 --> 38:40.600
Beautiful beautiful

38:40.920 --> 38:46.600
Do that again Hen do it again do it again do it again. Give us three. Oh, baby

38:47.800 --> 38:51.160
Right, so unfortunately you can't really do much more after you've killed this one

38:52.200 --> 38:54.200
Boom, baby

38:56.680 --> 39:01.400
Okay, next section we've got to do this bit correct because this is where you can fail

39:02.360 --> 39:08.200
The problem with the hill is you have to like judge behind the cannons. Oh triple, baby

39:08.600 --> 39:13.960
Let's go three for three. Obviously. We can't do it for this one because it's not third, but we've got three for three so far

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
Okay, wait what that one survived. Hello

39:21.720 --> 39:23.720
Uh

39:25.160 --> 39:27.160
Use me excuse a moi

39:28.440 --> 39:30.360
Do my eyes

39:30.360 --> 39:33.160
So this is the problem. You can't really hit those ones

39:33.640 --> 39:37.800
Now you might be saying you should hit that big brown thing. I've forgotten what their legal name is

39:38.680 --> 39:40.680
But the big brown thing doesn't count

39:42.120 --> 39:44.120
Uh, we can kill it. We've done what we can

39:44.520 --> 39:50.120
So either we'll fail or we'll win depending on what the game feels like see there's 20 villagers 10

39:50.680 --> 39:51.720
five

39:51.720 --> 39:56.280
We did it. We didn't get a ballista a siege tower. I

39:59.560 --> 40:01.560
Soldiers are climbing the walls

40:02.520 --> 40:05.160
Okay, this is one bit. I don't like about this game. You ready for this

40:05.960 --> 40:11.880
They change your weapons. So they've given me a sword. I've said, uh, let me keep my blade out because

40:12.280 --> 40:14.280
I prefer fighting with a blade the only

40:14.840 --> 40:18.920
Enemies that you're not to go against with the blade jump down. Oh, jeez

40:19.480 --> 40:22.040
Yeah, my ankles would be disintegrated if I did that

40:22.920 --> 40:24.200
um

40:24.200 --> 40:26.840
It's much easier to fight with the blades. Oh my god

40:27.720 --> 40:34.760
He just curbstomped that borgia guy. Did you see that encio? That's a war crime. You can't curbstomp people

40:35.640 --> 40:37.640
That's not how it works

40:38.200 --> 40:40.200
Jesus etio

40:40.440 --> 40:42.280
Okay, hold on

40:42.280 --> 40:46.840
These enemies. Oh my god, I just got twatted. Oh, I'm getting twat twice. Sorry. I'm too busy trying to be chatting

40:47.480 --> 40:52.840
Kill at the same time. Um, no, I'm missing. Oh, no, everyone's gonna know I'm a terrible gamer

40:54.200 --> 40:59.640
Um, the only enemies that are not effective. So like these guys for fuck's sake

41:00.040 --> 41:04.840
They freaking attack before they're supposed to you can break their stance just by spamming. It's not a problem

41:04.920 --> 41:08.920
Again, you for these guys that are double armored up literally take your gun out boom

41:09.720 --> 41:13.960
It didn't register it. See, oh, he's getting a bit close mate. You're gonna need to aim

41:16.520 --> 41:18.520
That was kind of it close for comfort

41:20.840 --> 41:26.440
Point blank etio that probably wasn't even five meters. No been do we need to put glicks on them?

41:32.200 --> 41:34.200
Oh, this is a sad bit

41:38.920 --> 41:40.920
Of assassins

41:57.160 --> 42:01.000
This is an invitation my family to yours

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I

42:16.040 --> 42:18.040
Like that part

42:21.240 --> 42:28.200
There is a sentence that he said though that your friend this gun that your friend fashioned for us keep that in mind

42:28.520 --> 42:34.120
I can walk faster means to stop in Italian

42:37.800 --> 42:39.800
So we are now

42:40.680 --> 42:45.560
Basically running on fumes adrenaline wise. We've literally just been absolutely

42:46.600 --> 42:49.880
Destroyed we have three bullet wins. I think shoulder

42:50.520 --> 42:55.960
Uh abdomen. Oh, okay. Just to show we've got two bullet wins. I could have sworn it used to be three

42:55.960 --> 42:58.520
But I'm probably just wish me remember being

42:59.480 --> 43:06.760
Uh, but yeah, we've literally our liver is currently bleeding out our kidney most like ow. What happened there?

43:09.000 --> 43:14.440
Did you see me get turned into that rubbish pile? I was like liquid. Did you see that?

43:16.440 --> 43:20.600
Ouch, I don't want to be jelly. Please don't turn me into jelly

43:22.600 --> 43:24.760
Hey leaf cloudia lonia bam

43:26.200 --> 43:32.840
So you'll get assigned one soldier to kill in the sequence, but they all do they all are aggressive towards you

43:33.560 --> 43:36.680
You can clean them up if you really desire

43:36.920 --> 43:43.320
But if the arrow is red that means the ai has assigned to attack you if the arrow is yellow they'll attack

43:44.120 --> 43:48.360
Oh, also the guards have assassin abilities. Look how he's sitting on the wall

43:48.920 --> 43:55.880
The coding in this game is a bit funny. Um, if you upset NPCs, they turn into assassins and start climbing walls

43:55.960 --> 43:57.400
and stuff

43:57.400 --> 44:02.360
You could always break a guard stance with a kick if you are struggling to fight them

44:03.000 --> 44:06.760
But we do get access to long range weaponry very shortly. Um

44:07.880 --> 44:13.880
But yeah, uh, you can ignore all these I think and just go straight in here. No you can't

44:14.360 --> 44:19.320
You have to wait until they're assigned to you. Okay. Okay. Okay. The game does it quite often where it won't

44:20.920 --> 44:22.440
Let you in

44:22.440 --> 44:24.680
If someone is target locked onto you

44:26.280 --> 44:30.520
Hey, come on Claudio ain't go all day. Jesus. We're under a siege. Take your time hen

44:31.880 --> 44:35.640
Ezio, I'm in here. I will hold the back. Stop wait for us

44:36.200 --> 44:41.400
We thought you had to kill sir Ezio. Not yet. Where does this passage lead to the north outside the walls?

44:41.400 --> 44:46.520
Are you surprised it exists? I might have to open my door. Um, I must go help the troops

44:46.920 --> 44:49.880
My freaking room is getting so hot with this computer

44:49.880 --> 44:51.880
Ah

44:53.400 --> 45:00.440
I'm coming. So we're currently inside the Auditori villa. We're now going down down down down deep inside

45:01.560 --> 45:04.120
Down deep inside see how do you pick me?

45:07.080 --> 45:13.800
I'm sweating um, I'm sitting on my sweaty feet right now. I don't know how you guys sit in your chairs, but I sit on my feet

45:14.120 --> 45:16.120
Oh

45:17.640 --> 45:22.520
We will play Assassin's Creed 2 because that is a very beautiful section in Assassin's Creed 2

45:23.080 --> 45:27.400
We're essentially playing Assassin's Creed 2.5. It's fine brotherhood's good game

45:29.000 --> 45:33.800
Right lore lore. I'm gonna take a war sip water sipping then take a sip with me if you're not got war

45:44.760 --> 45:46.760
Oh

45:55.080 --> 45:57.080
The horse was a paid actor

46:00.520 --> 46:04.040
I'm not flexible enough to sit on your feet. I'll make you flexible once I've done me

46:05.880 --> 46:07.880
Sorry

46:08.360 --> 46:10.360
Hmm

46:11.960 --> 46:13.960
We're actually speedrunning

46:14.680 --> 46:20.280
Just love this game all over everything about it. The patience fantastic. We've completed sequence dna one

46:21.800 --> 46:23.800
Battle wounds achievement unlocked

46:28.120 --> 46:30.120
Lucy, I can't seem to get a position

46:32.040 --> 46:34.600
Poe could one of you tell me what's going on

46:35.160 --> 46:36.600
Sorry

46:36.600 --> 46:41.160
I will tell you at the end a very sad fact about that blonde girl you see on the screen right now

46:42.680 --> 46:44.680
But only at the end

46:45.160 --> 46:47.160
Right, so that says in present day

46:49.320 --> 46:51.320
Congrats if your name's Desmond

46:52.600 --> 46:54.600
Congrats

46:54.680 --> 46:58.360
Congrats if your name's Sean Sean's one with glasses. Congrats

46:58.680 --> 47:01.800
I'm convinced we need to get our hands on Ezio's apple of Eden

47:02.360 --> 47:05.640
Minerva altered it somehow when she are the tame traveling

47:06.120 --> 47:10.280
We're at the Alti Torre Zilla. I will tell you in a second. It's our last safe, but we were present day

47:10.520 --> 47:12.520
It turns out the Templars are watching the border

47:13.160 --> 47:18.520
Ezio hid the poe sometime in 1507, but when I try to access that dna sequence

47:19.160 --> 47:22.040
He seems to be remembering something else

47:23.160 --> 47:26.200
Like a memory inside a memory. Yes, exactly

47:26.920 --> 47:32.280
Maybe exactly maybe I believe you experienced something similar back at obstaga, didn't you?

47:32.520 --> 47:37.080
Subject 15 exhibited memory within memory like patterns, but she was pregnant

47:37.640 --> 47:40.520
The memories of prego's father and mother not in this was

47:41.320 --> 47:43.320
Desmond's not pregnant

47:44.280 --> 47:48.280
Oh my god, we've just been fat shamed in 2024

47:49.720 --> 47:55.320
You guys remember when Bal got that model and she was like inflated and someone was like

47:56.040 --> 48:00.280
This is fat shaming. I was like, no, bro. That's real 34 open your eyes

48:04.120 --> 48:09.480
That's crazy that either that or rebecca's is not a very good engineer. Thanks asshole

48:11.880 --> 48:15.880
Imagine coming out with an inflation model and someone's like you're fat shaming. No mother fucker

48:25.560 --> 48:32.920
Ages ago the waves go through everything above brown. They're gonna find us. No, they aren't come with me

48:43.320 --> 48:45.320
Oh

48:48.200 --> 48:53.320
There's a lot of cutscene stuff up ahead, but I'll try and for those who don't know the game I will very quickly summarize

48:53.400 --> 48:55.640
From the inside we're not getting in this way

48:56.280 --> 49:01.480
What's her next move the road just moves back into the highway. This is not a good place for us to be right now

49:01.720 --> 49:06.920
Do we have any tarps? We need to cover up the van. I really hate to stress this yeah, but we are running out of time

49:07.960 --> 49:11.400
That's Sean. We'll help us. That's Rebecca. That's Lucy any ideas?

49:12.200 --> 49:17.160
I don't know. Maybe there's another way into the sanctuary. Hey, I think I've got something

49:17.480 --> 49:23.560
Okay, so we're modern-day Desmond if you don't know the game

49:23.960 --> 49:26.680
Uh, we basically have a special bloodline

49:27.960 --> 49:29.960
That commutes to the gods that created us

49:30.360 --> 49:37.320
Um, and we use Desmond's DNA sequence in order to go back in the past very fictional based. Uh, I

49:38.200 --> 49:42.520
Absolutely loved the concept when I was a child and I wanted it to be so real

49:44.040 --> 49:46.280
I was like take me back to the battle of anaconda

49:47.560 --> 49:49.560
Take me to big willy walrus

49:50.440 --> 49:52.440
I want to see the construction

50:03.320 --> 50:06.200
So we are like the trunk. I'm sorry. I don't know what the trunks are

50:07.400 --> 50:12.680
Memories are stored in DNA. Yes. That's the quickest way. Oh my god me and Lucy

50:17.880 --> 50:19.880
Oh

50:26.040 --> 50:28.760
Oh, yeah, you know how to have fun you'll have fun with me the night Lucy

50:36.760 --> 50:42.920
Okay, there we go. Oh, that was a loading screen by the way, it looked like it wasn't they were trying to hide it

50:43.160 --> 50:45.160
What was that?

50:45.480 --> 50:51.960
So Desmond also sees the past because his it's basically leaking into his present

50:52.840 --> 50:55.400
So Lucy can't see any of this we can see this

51:00.440 --> 51:06.440
They escaped through here what that's you and the villagers after the attack I can see them now

51:07.800 --> 51:12.200
I know it's difficult, but try to compartmentalize focus on the present

51:12.600 --> 51:14.600
What if I can't stop the visions?

51:14.760 --> 51:17.000
How long before I start painting symbols on the walls?

51:17.640 --> 51:23.640
Don't joke about that. Subject 16 had the bleeding effect that he's talking about and ended up in himself

51:24.200 --> 51:26.520
But we learned more about him in Assassin's Creed 3

51:32.200 --> 51:34.200
Well the animus he does to a man

51:36.040 --> 51:41.640
Please do not refer to the animus that lets us go back into the past is the animus

51:43.080 --> 51:45.080
Oh

51:48.120 --> 51:52.920
Is a revelation not unless you want me to end up like that skeleton always

51:54.120 --> 51:56.120
I'll find a way around

51:56.280 --> 51:59.640
Always revelations, you're right. Sorry, my apologies. I apologize

52:01.800 --> 52:04.600
I would say this is a revelation

52:05.240 --> 52:09.720
Do you guys remember Dan bull's cover of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood revelations?

52:10.280 --> 52:12.920
I meant if you see any

52:15.640 --> 52:18.520
So we are now backtracking our way of sort

52:20.440 --> 52:23.960
This is the problem. There's so much dialogue in this game at the start

52:24.440 --> 52:27.720
And we are now backtracking trying to get back inside the villa

52:31.000 --> 52:33.560
Oh no, Claudia, that's our sister

52:40.440 --> 52:45.480
Just joined. Why is he wearing jeans? We're in present day. Actually. Yeah, could you jump about in jeans?

52:47.160 --> 52:51.160
I don't even wear jeans. I don't even wear clothes after time actually

52:52.440 --> 52:56.440
Do you want to guess what clothes I'm wearing right now? Because it's not what you think

53:00.840 --> 53:02.840
Okay

53:04.520 --> 53:06.520
We are selling tutorials, so it's a bit slow, but

53:09.720 --> 53:11.720
Okay

53:12.120 --> 53:15.480
Um, I just wear a bra and a hoodie

53:16.600 --> 53:22.280
That's it. So my bear arms is on my game and chair right now with my sweaty feet as well

53:23.400 --> 53:28.680
They never stop sweating neither do my hands. My hands are very sweaty right now actually, but they don't sweat as much as my feet

53:28.760 --> 53:31.000
I'm sorry. I don't I don't think I don't care. I'll show up about that

53:34.440 --> 53:36.280
Oh my marriage

53:36.360 --> 53:40.920
Oh, I have marriage oopsies forgot to talk about that. I have marriage if you want to support me

53:41.160 --> 53:45.080
I'm getting key chains with the girls and we're I'm going to make a little key chain ASMR

53:51.800 --> 53:56.440
So the thing about this cutscene you have no health so you can literally just do that

53:57.240 --> 54:00.280
You can't die in this cutscene in this section of the game

54:01.400 --> 54:03.880
It's not a cutscene. It's a section again. You can just drop down

54:07.240 --> 54:09.400
When did this become I wish I wish you

54:14.120 --> 54:16.120
Nice try ready

54:19.400 --> 54:23.560
God well, do you see such a skinny legend on this one found a switch

54:26.360 --> 54:29.800
Oh, no, no don't do that. That's morey. Here we go

54:33.400 --> 54:35.400
Something's open

54:35.800 --> 54:37.800
Yeah, my leg. Hey, yo

54:40.520 --> 54:42.520
Absolutely brain

54:45.320 --> 54:47.320
So he shouldn't have said this line yet because

54:48.200 --> 54:49.320
Oh

54:49.320 --> 54:52.520
I've never had that happen before I got pushed out the way by the shadow

54:53.880 --> 54:59.160
Oh my god, I've never had that happen before the shadows are freaking I wonder if you can attack the shadow

55:00.760 --> 55:02.920
I've never been pushed out the way by the shadow before

55:03.640 --> 55:10.040
See this is the thing about playing the same game over and over something you'll happen every time and it's just fantastic

55:11.000 --> 55:13.240
Anyway, we're about to swim in medieval toxic waste

55:16.200 --> 55:18.200
The game's being coded as you play

55:20.600 --> 55:24.200
Toxic waste it was Lucy's idea

55:24.200 --> 55:26.200
Oh

55:27.720 --> 55:28.840
You're exaggerating

55:28.840 --> 55:35.000
Whoa, whoa, uh, see when the camera angle start to shift it actually makes things like really hard to judge

55:35.320 --> 55:37.320
It's good for the skin

55:38.200 --> 55:40.920
Remember the that one post where that guy was like

55:42.040 --> 55:48.920
For $500 let me go in your septic tank and he just hangs out in there and does the thing and it was like, oh you're

55:49.800 --> 55:51.240
I mean

55:51.240 --> 55:53.240
Yeah, that was quite the post

55:54.440 --> 55:56.440
Wait

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
You're going so fast the game can't keep up

56:00.600 --> 56:02.600
That was minging honest

56:08.360 --> 56:13.960
Oh my god, it's you no it's you Desmond. Did you just ask a woman why she's not wet?

56:14.680 --> 56:17.320
That's sexual harassment, honestly water check

56:20.280 --> 56:22.280
Oh, I just fell water. Oh well, it's fine

56:23.240 --> 56:29.560
I'm sorry. It like cold water just went on my leg and I'm like, ah, you know, that's fine. It's actually not that big a deal

56:32.680 --> 56:35.800
Jesus, you know, that's brutal making someone fall to their death

56:38.040 --> 56:40.520
Now I'm wet. I'm a cuttlefish. I was wet from the start

56:45.240 --> 56:51.000
Human resources. Why is septic tank? It's just what the guy wanted. It's like that Japanese post

56:51.720 --> 56:55.240
Oh, this is another thing. There is this is a true

56:55.720 --> 56:57.080
hashtag

56:57.080 --> 56:58.120
story

56:58.120 --> 56:59.480
and

56:59.480 --> 57:02.920
So this wife went away on holiday for the weekend

57:03.880 --> 57:06.200
And her neighbor on Friday

57:07.160 --> 57:09.800
went into her like toilet tank

57:10.680 --> 57:13.640
Like Japanese toilets are different from the way it's like done

57:13.880 --> 57:18.280
So he could look up and peep at her while she disintegrated basically

57:18.840 --> 57:22.680
Um and because she went away on holiday, uh, that man

57:23.320 --> 57:24.920
perished

57:24.920 --> 57:25.960
via

57:25.960 --> 57:28.440
I'm freezing to death in kaka

57:29.080 --> 57:31.080
I was like, bro

57:31.560 --> 57:34.120
Don't get me wrong. I'm no really

57:35.320 --> 57:38.280
Shame in anyone for what they like, but to die

57:39.640 --> 57:40.680
To die

57:40.680 --> 57:42.680
I'll wait here. It's a bit extreme

57:43.560 --> 57:45.560
It's a bit extreme

57:46.280 --> 57:49.160
Oh g-san messed up on that one. I'm not gonna lie. Oh g-san

57:51.160 --> 57:53.160
Yeah

57:56.760 --> 57:59.800
Did they scatter his ashes?

58:01.080 --> 58:05.800
That's too funny that I can't even laugh at that. That's awful. That's awful

58:08.360 --> 58:11.160
Oh my god, that was so quick-witted

58:11.960 --> 58:13.960
Damn

58:14.280 --> 58:14.840
Thanks

58:14.840 --> 58:20.120
Anyway, the sequence is just teaching us the relationship that et-sio has with lucy

58:20.680 --> 58:23.800
Ed Desmond has with lucy jesus. I have the bleeding effect myself

58:24.440 --> 58:29.480
No, no before you freaking take that out of context. The bleeding effect is when Desmond thingy's

58:30.280 --> 58:35.720
Oh, uh, Veechabur's stomach is sore. It must mean they're they're just a ketchup packet. No

58:37.000 --> 58:39.960
Stop it with the ketchup packet allegations. Okay

58:40.760 --> 58:43.160
Veechabur's can't beat them enough. My goodness

58:45.080 --> 58:52.440
Veechabur feels mildly ill. Oh, she must be a ketchup packet. You stop that right now naughty naughty

58:53.640 --> 58:55.640
Stop it

59:01.800 --> 59:05.720
It's all right, I'm a mustard pat it comes out yellow. Hello

59:05.720 --> 59:09.240
Oh, should I be worried? Do we need to get you a doctor?

59:14.920 --> 59:19.320
When the past memories and new ones melt in yes Desmond has a very hard time

59:19.880 --> 59:26.200
Differentiating himself from et-sio because he spends so much time in the animus as et-sio. I mean you'd do it too

59:27.320 --> 59:31.720
You'd do it too. You'd do it too. All right friendly over the section

59:32.360 --> 59:35.080
Oh my god, it's the back of the statue

59:37.160 --> 59:41.160
Repeat after me stat you that's how you say statue in scots stat you

59:42.520 --> 59:44.520
No tea stat you

59:46.200 --> 59:48.200
Oh, I guess there is a tea technical

59:52.760 --> 59:56.680
Well, I'm as if you die in the animus and you just perish

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.680
No tea I've finished

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.680
Wow weapon ice gets free

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.920
True

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.080
Et-sio must have come back here way after the attack

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.040
But why

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.040
Desmond

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:27.240
Desmond let's open that door. I think big dizzy. Here's like, hmm big easy big as you all the touring

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:36.280
You have any fizzy juice, no, I might get a cola later, but right now I'm I'm high. I'm high is okay

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.080
I'm literally playing my favorite game of all time. I'm allowed to just word vomit and do whatever I please

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:48.440
Life is good. Bruv. Bruv. Life is good. I'm happy. I hope you know this experience is enjoyable

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.800
Don't apologize about burps. I don't burp much with water, but hey

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.960
Can you open the damn bookcase Desmond says Sean as I cut over his voiceline

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.120
Yes, et-sio has three things

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.720
Assassin's Creed to Assassin's Creed brotherhood and Assassin's Creed revelations are all et-sio elder towards storyline

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.760
Numbers Mason. Oh my god, we need to play black ops

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.720
In 1421

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.320
Oh my head, are we? That's all right Desmond has a boo boo

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Let's get the animus down there

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.840
You're gonna create an entire corporal weirdo. Hey

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.240
Uh, um was watching the everyone's 2.0's

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.200
Uh lurking in the shadows

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.480
I'm so happy. Make sure you aren't followed

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.920
What is that smell?

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:01.080
It's my clothes. It was Lucy's idea. I smell like you swam through a sewer

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:08.200
It was Lucy's idea. It was Lucy's idea. Wait a second guys. You need to remember the there's a line right?

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.760
Is that confliction in his voice going? That's the word

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.920
Oh

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:17.000
My name rule one suck you are the king

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.600
Oh the girls they're absolutely fantastic in their 2.0's absolutely adore them

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.560
um

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.680
like

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.320
Obviously, I'm happy to talk about like some behind the scenes stuff

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.520
But like they were kind of shocked that I'm like, yeah, just do what you want

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.240
Like whatever you want go for it. You can say what you want

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.480
Obviously, as long as you don't see any nda content, you can talk about the interview with me if you want

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.480
You can talk about how you found the process

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.120
Talk about how you found debut

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.160
Um, yeah, just do what you want and have fun. I'm here to be a booty hole

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.800
Right look around Montoregioni for circuitless

01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.600
That little dude asked they'll re-wrote small amounts of electricity to the power line underneath the villa

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.200
Don't ask me how they work if I understood that I wouldn't be the fellow hide in the van

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:06.440
I

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Used to think

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
He is he Wheatley?

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.280
I think he might be Wheatley. I'm not sure from

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:15.880
a

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.880
portal to

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:23.960
So we're now currently getting an energy supply to the animus underneath the villa

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:32.120
In order for upstairs go the big baddies are called upstairs go in this game or templates. Those are the big baddies

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.160
Um, so basically you just need to go around the city

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.240
You can see that the patched everything up from the uh five centuries ago

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.960
That the big old fights were occurring. I really like stacey milk. Yeah

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.800
I saw the reaction to fondle a bosom

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:57.560
Admit that it was funny. Okay. Admit that it was funny or pick up 24 cards in uno right now

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:04.360
And anyone sitting with 24 cards in their hand are liars. Okay fondle a bosom was hilarious. I don't care

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.360
I think someone was like it sounds like you're naming them from like that parody

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.600
um

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.600
That parody movie

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:19.960
Uh austin powers and I'm like, yeah, you're supposed to have fun names. Who wants serious names that like no one can remember

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.560
like

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:28.600
Cuttles cuttlefish. Okay, so any cuttles. Let's go. Uh, a polar bear. Okay. I see I see still pause. Yes. She has pause

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.160
And she's cold. I see stop us. Let's go

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.640
Like it's really it's not that bad

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.920
Um, so you're supposed to just look around with eagle vision to get a sense of moving around. Um

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:46.120
And all that jazz there's like one right next to me. Isn't there yet? It's right behind me. Uh box

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.080
I vana humpullo

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.600
Hey

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.200
That was not a name karambi. No karambi for like a cs gov each of her

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.800
Perfect name. Don't care karambit. Yes

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.120
And karam sounds like haram so you can probably make a few puns

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.320
Yes, it's booted

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.560
Name from money python's life of brian incontinent above

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:19.000
African saw you's all laughing at it and someone posted that incontinent to a screenshot

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.960
I was like, oh no, they've got me laughing. I was like, oh, that was actually really funny

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.880
All right, we're going in the animus

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:30.840
We're about to go back into the past to be it's your auditory if we're still in the tutorial stage

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.240
I will tell you when we get out of this tutorial stage. Uh, we've still probably got another hour and a bit

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.360
sanctuary

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:45.480
As you may have noticed in the van, I've made some improvements to the animus and have a new vr training program

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.360
Here you can show off all those flashy moves you picked up from your ancestors

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:52.600
Let me open one in the mission

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.120
AC show

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.800
AC hall

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.920
Okay, but it doesn't make sense. Maybe if we had like a fire and ace like v tripper just saying ac

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:07.000
No, we can't like call ac. We already have ac. Oh, oh shit. Okay. So this is the virtual training. I despise it

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I absolutely despise it

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:15.560
I just cannot stand this section. It's for people who enjoy the combat or practicing it me

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.320
I hate it. I despise it. Okay. You see that skinny guard? He is a problem

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:28.840
They can grab you. Yeah, see the guards are trying to grab me and then it breaks your streak if they grab you and so annoying

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:36.520
I freaking hate the we guards. Honestly. Oh, and I hate the Lancers too. I absolutely hate it. I'm much better in combat

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.600
Yeah, fuck you. Take it

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.560
Take it the Lancers have much bigger reach and are very hard to counter

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:49.320
So when you're on a killing streak it's much better to aim for those guys to defend your streak basically

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.480
Skinny ball bad guards. Oh, honestly

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.360
Lancer hates the skinny guards hate because they are agile warriors

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.320
And you have to freaking have a wee knife out in order to counter them properly

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.240
Shrimp check. Yep posture still shrimp. Thank you

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.280
Oh, we're in the tutorial for like another two hours

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:17.960
But the reason I'm going to praise the game is because it's hidden that you're in the tutorial

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:27.080
You progress through the story of the game via the tutorial like I know that sounds silly to praise that because obviously all games work like that but

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.520
I'll kind of

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.720
You can leave the machine whenever you like

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.520
I'm all set to go. Don't worry

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.560
One last thing as you raise your synchronization by executing events

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.800
repressed memories

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:50.520
You might even discover some repressed memories. She be caught in bottom. Okay, let's get started

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.640
Ass and feet locked on that seat. Oh, that's actually a really good like model

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.440
Ready for like an eight hour stream

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920
Ass and feet get on that suit

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:13.560
Anyway, I never expected you to see you play something. I have terrible news, but these should personally play a video game

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.800
Subjects, dude

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.240
Okay, we're here present day

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:35.400
Give me one second. I'm gonna get a cola. Okay, I'll leave it on so I'm least I'm not yapping over the actual cutscenes for once

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.400
Oh

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:03.880
Sorry, I forget my hip. I need to close my eyes if I walk away so the sleep thing clicks on right but

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.960
Come on me. Come on me. Oh my god. Listen to the music

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.800
Beautiful

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.920
Oh gorgeous

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.520
Roma

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.600
Yes

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.280
I just got chills

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.720
Such an idiot. I just love this game so much

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:53.720
I just feel like so full of it like my heart feels so full. I get to share this game and

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.560
Just appreciate it for what it is and this game come out in 2010

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:06.040
And it aged beautifully. I will not tell I will not take anyone telling me this game didn't age well

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:13.480
So we're currently injured and going to the doctor. We're about to learn about health bar. So we're still injured

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.240
We're still hurt

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.400
In the top left corner. We have five health squares and only one left

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:24.360
That is how we deal with health in the game. Do not take that horse

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.760
I don't know why they put that horse there unironically

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.800
You don't go any faster on the horse to get to the healer

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.400
Trying to tip you it says internal server. It's okay. You don't have to give me money. Just hanging out. It's fine

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.360
Hey, I'm not sure about the problem is but hey

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.160
But don't worry. You don't have to give me money. Thank you very much

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.800
For a man of your age. Tisk, tisk

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Four out of five doctors would suggest leeches

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:02.920
No leeches

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.800
However, I can recommend several good colleagues around the sea

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.600
Do you need anything else?

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:15.560
Have fun at work. Don't worry guys. If you ever have to leave stream. I am an endurance streamer. I'm not very friendly

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:22.840
Long time streamer. Um, I do plan on streaming for eight hours or finishing the

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:31.720
Story mode of this game and tomorrow we will 100% it because I've never 100% of the game before but with your

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:37.080
Encouragement, I think it's possible. I think I could 100% this game

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.920
When you collect all the board your tower like the flags

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.840
um

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.560
All the hidden flags that are also in the halls of nero, which I will teach you all about very shortly

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.160
So this

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:55.640
Beautiful cutscene is how we unlock sections of the map on the HUD. Okay, they're all hidden at the moment

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.440
But we are going to be doing map update as you can see

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:02.840
Uh synchronized view points beauty beauty beauty

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:09.560
It talks on you. I'm listening at work. Oh my god. Oh, those are the naughty naughty

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.720
Stinky borgia

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:21.320
We don't like borgia. We don't take kindly to your kind around these parts borgia

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:29.480
100% in this game in two days possible. Yes, sir with autism anything is possible

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.240
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I apologize

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.920
Um

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.400
I am very passionate about what I'm passionate about and if I am like unable to do so

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.960
So ie I can just straight up like play this game the way I want to then yes

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.400
We're also like 100% in skyrim next week achievement one

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.560
I'm so sorry. It must be like really weird. Just randomly come out with it. I'll

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.480
We'll refer to the strontism. How about that? So we're currently tailing. Do you see the yellow hit marker or hitbox above these?

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.440
This is tailing. It means do not be discovered by them

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.800
They can be pushed by NPCs so they can turn around and look at you. It's not um

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.160
It's not the best but it certainly works perfectly well

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.200
It's absolutely beautiful game

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:28.120
So we're just entailing these guards don't look backwards unless an NPC kindly bumps into them

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.320
So we can get as close as we want. We can like creep on the walls

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.440
Cece he just turned around there if I wasn't creeping on the wall

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.440
Even the game's like uh, you should maintain your distance. You're a bit too close, but we can like creep

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.440
Creeping

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.760
Okay, and you can also blend in but I am not controlling the movement of this crowd

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.400
The crowd will go on a certain path so you can part ways but you cannot be discovered

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.640
While concealed in a crown like this guards can walk by me

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.640
I can have high notoriety and guards will ignore me as long as I am

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.360
100% in the achievements in skyrim, sorry

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:24.040
I don't mean 100% in skyrim because that is impossible as you said because of the repeating quest factors

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.720
The achievements I have 100% at skyrim achievements

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:33.480
Uh multiple times and I would absolutely love to share the experience with you and tell you about all the secret

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.200
little bits I know

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.800
And yeah, okay

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.640
I'm also going to mention the multiplayer and brotherhood. I believe the servers are down

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:50.200
Okay. Oh, whoa. That just came out nowhere. Hold on. Hold on. We weren't even at the we were not even at the section

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.840
Okay, we didn't even go

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.440
We were

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.480
And see I didn't kill civilians. Did I kill a human?

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.280
Like a non-guard

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.040
What is going on?

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.440
Oh my god, sorry. The sequence was not supposed to start on that staircase

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.240
It's supposed to start by the freaking did I kill him if I'm a citizen?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.600
Uh

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.640
What just happened? I think I was too distracted. I apologize

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.720
But don't worry. We can always replay and come back for 100%

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.120
I can't believe I just killed a citizen

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:31.320
I never make that mistake in this game

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Sorry

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.040
I too have lost family to the rope

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:57.080
Treachery you called you cuddled off

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
When you are what the fuck go down

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.480
Sorry, you guys didn't see that all these options just popped up on my screen

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.880
I was like, these are too many things going on right now. Okay, so

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.400
This quest do you see how we are assigned someone with a name?

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.400
That is because you're actually killing multiplayer characters

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.320
That are in multiplayer. I know it sounds silly and I know it sounds bizarre, but

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.720
When you could play Assassin's Creed brotherhood multiplayer

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:40.120
You got to pick between the skins and we're literally about to kill someone who is a skin in the multiplayer mode

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:44.360
100% for this one is just air assassination. Super simple and easy

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:50.600
The guards do attack you but some turn into cowards once you kill multiple guards, which is a lovely

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.480
PayPal support doesn't open for several hours

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.400
Did I break PayPal?

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.800
Oops

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.160
Are you guys trying to support me too much that we broke PayPal?

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.320
Wait, can none of the girls get donations right now?

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.560
Uh, so you can be grabbed but as I said the more guards you kill some of the weaker ones

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:19.640
Like the ones with just a hat will turn into cowards, which is an absolutely lovely human detail

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.400
Yeah, see the ones with those like beret type hats they turn into cowards

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.720
Beautiful

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:34.200
Beautiful detail. I think that is gorgeous to show human nature instead of the AI

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:42.520
Just being like constantly attack attack attack die die die because you will I just think these are and this is 2010

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:50.280
Development was 20 2008 2008 maybe even as far back as 2007

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.240
Um, so you're not allowed to scale the rooftops

01:17:53.720 --> 01:18:00.280
Because guards find you extremely sussy, but guards on the floor don'ts like this guy does not care about me right now

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.280
um

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.080
But like for development that far back to like capture

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:12.280
To even think outside the box to capture human nature like that definitely hats off to the development team

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:18.520
Um, I know it is by ubi soft and there are some very there's a very unique

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:25.160
Ending to this tale and Assassin's Creed brotherhood and I couldn't for the life of me

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.880
There's a feather up on here by the way

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:30.040
You can grab

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:35.880
Sightings if you cite something but can't grab it you can go into ego mode and then it'll automatically stick to your map

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.360
Which is fantastic. So if you see something but you can't grab it in the moment. Um,

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.320
But yeah

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.520
This game has also been rated

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.560
In the top 100 games of all time

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.680
I believe it placed around 60th on recent 100

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.400
Game ranking type things

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:03.560
But Assassin's Creed brotherhood always makes it and I 100% agree for me it is first place, but I'm biased

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:09.160
But absolutely deserved it. So we have met marquiovelli. This is marquiovelli. He was the guy

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:15.320
Um, that was in the villa and that was disappointed in us not killing the spanyard

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:22.280
Uh, and he is gonna tell us what's going on in roma because we don't know what's going on in roma

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:27.160
We know the borja is everywhere as we can see them literally in front of us right now

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:31.480
So we are going to get the dirty details on what's going on in roma

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.320
Yeah

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.320
Borja hate we hate the borja

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.440
I'm gonna burp is that okay

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:04.760
That was me popping my lips. That was the actual burp. Sorry. Sorry to mislead you like that

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:10.200
So you need to wait for a little second, uh, because if you go too quickly into the

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.280
Blacksmith

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:16.600
Uh, the items won't actually be available to purchase which is your literal quest

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.840
So you're buying an armor and a small weapon

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:26.920
This small weapon is what you use against the skinny guards because it is amazing for taming on defending yourself

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:32.920
Now you can survive that's right. That's right. I debated you didn't know. Yeah, you thought that pop was my burp

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.920
And

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:02.520
So for some reason even though you're right next to him he gets really quiet in certain voicelines

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.920
Cruel beyond the magic

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
The laws of men mean nothing

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.800
He murdered his own brother who takes power. He knows neither danger nor fatigue

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.880
Those who do not fall. I'm literally hugging him to get him to talk

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.480
Jar of leeches head of the people

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.560
What does he intend to do with his power?

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.040
so again

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.760
Eagle vision to lock in that flag because we can't grab it right now, but that's okay

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.600
Okay, so we're starting to learn

01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:01.080
That the Borgia has overtaken roma and is completely messing it up for the people

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:09.320
And mark you avail is obviously not very happy, but we have to do what the current laid-out rules are

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.280
and

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.080
Yummy jar of leeches

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.080
The cuttlefish eat leeches. I feel like they probably do

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.080
I'll talk after this bit

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.680
Water check

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.040
large

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:56.840
Okay

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.400
Now to very quickly bring you up to speed

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:07.000
The Borgia are forbidding us in this section to use the stables and other areas of development

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.720
Also, this is the most fucking annoying

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:16.440
Thing to get 100% on hold on. Oh get off the horse. I hate when they go on the horse

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.800
Oh, no, I've made it so much worse. Okay. So this captain you have to grab him and put him in that

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.800
Um

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.720
Uh, oh my god, that freaking citizen was in the way. I didn't want to strike in case

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:32.440
I can't see because of the camera angles

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:38.840
By the way, this game aged really well aged really well. I promise it aged well

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.960
No

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.680
Right. I am going to no. He's on it. No

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.960
This couldn't have gone any worse

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:52.600
Please I've never had this issue in this game before

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.920
Right, just grab him grab him and push him. Fuck him. You can kill

01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:03.960
Right. No, right. We're not 100% in this right now. I'm literally bright red and embarrassment of this gameplay

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.640
We're fuck you

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.360
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:17.640
Please get off the horses. I hate when they're on the horses. All right, maybe I can do it. Hold on

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:25.160
Oh my god, I can still 100% it. Okay. You need to basically drag this guy to the scaffolding and push him in it

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.120
Yes

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:33.480
Whenever you kill a captain of a district always loot his body

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.280
He has insane amounts of money on his person

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.560
That was terrible, but we resurrected it

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:46.920
The reason and you have to kill the other guards first is so you are free to push that guy into the scaffolding to achieve 100% on this

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:53.160
Borgia tower. My god. I have never attracted those other four guards before

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.280
I've never had them jump on freaking horses before

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
That was terrible

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.680
But we did it we got 100%

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:08.760
Oh my god, I'm my face is bright red. I'm like, oh my god

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:13.720
Oh, I forgot to burn the tower off for goodness sake. Okay. We need to call

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.840
Not the tower. Oh my god. I'm getting so flustered. Oh, right

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:26.520
So we've just reclaimed this district. So you need to burn the tower to in order to symbolize to the

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:33.000
Borgia, they're no longer welcome in this area and their rules no longer apply to this current district of roma. Okay

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.880
wait

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:43.160
I'm an idiot. Marquia Valley hasn't told me to burn the tower yet. Please pardon me for jumping that tower

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.560
I'm skipping ahead of the game

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:48.840
Right out my way out my way out my way out my way

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.480
The guards make peep you here, but they don't actually get you. Okay. We are now giving instructions

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.560
Oh, I might need to take my hoodie off I'm sweating and embarrassment

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:07.800
I was like, oh my god, you guys are gonna think I've never played this game before. I'm like, no

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:14.040
It's my favorite game of all time the guards outside there will peep you but they'll never follow you inside as long as you keep moving

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.200
Yeah, the guards will never go for you

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.640
Um

01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:24.600
Literally xio is exhausted. He's climbed this tower three times now. He's like Jesus woman. Give me a break. Okay

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.120
You can ignite to the Borgia tower

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.400
Like so

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.240
Oh, because all the kill-out

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:56.120
Okay, now this is another interesting part of the game, which you can renovate districts to have an income

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:04.520
The controller vibration on the literally uh, it's crazy

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.880
Okay, we have just renovated the stables. We now have access to horsey-worsies

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:12.120
Yeah

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.960
No

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.320
So we will jump on a horse. Thank you horse VTuber. We love you

01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.960
He does he's supposed to talk to you through this but it bugs out so he's not talking to us right now

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.440
but basically he's like

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.080
You can't just do what you want. It's xio. It's dangerous. Roma have been here

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.240
The Borgia have like

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.520
Settled their ways the people are scared basically too long didn't read. Thank you marcia valley for your input

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.880
Uh, it always bugs out. He should be talking to us like right now

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.760
You always use the white and gray horse here, I'm gonna say something

01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.240
Nope, here we go

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.480
Oh, he mad at us

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.240
Yes, yes brotherhood of the people. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh shit. Sorry. Sorry

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.880
Also, you should always go behind the NPC because that'll happen

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.200
The audio is bugging out

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.720
Wait, can you guys not hear the game?

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.080
Eh

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:55.560
I will wait that he can't be Torio. I need to get contact there. It sounds fit

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.360
Give me a bad one. Eh

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:03.960
Why oh

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:11.320
Input what you can turn this feature off. I never fucking asked you to turn it on you twat

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.600
Fuck off right

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:20.840
Is it still crunching is it the game that's crunching or me that's crunching

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:25.400
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. It's chase mission. It's a chase mission

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:31.720
It's the game that's crunchy. What the frick why have to be crunchy?

01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:35.240
Oh

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.320
Hold on

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:40.040
Why are you crunchy?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.720
Okay, I'm opening up the game. I'm gonna muck around with the audio sentence. Um, you know

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.360
Mission failed. We'll get him next time

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:54.360
All right, why would you be crunchy even though I didn't change a single thing?

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.360
Am I gonna have to close the game and open it back up again?

01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.600
Yeah, this isn't gonna do anything

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.320
Okay, okay, we're closing the game

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.080
We're closing the game

01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:15.080
Abort memory. Oh my god. We're in the middle of a freaking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No progress. It's gonna be lost sure useless

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:23.480
You naughty boy. Why would it be crunchy? I got a notification and the thing was like I am changing

01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:29.640
Your input and I dismissed it because I never told it to do anything and I just freaking did it. I'm gonna burp

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.640
Who goes there by the pope identify yourself?

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.160
I said close game

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:39.160
Did I not say close game?

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:41.880
Would you like to would you like to close perhaps?

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.520
Yes, yes, you may close the game. Yes, that's as perfectly fine. You're allowed to

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.240
uh, right close

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.280
That

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:55.240
Maybe I just need to do desktop audio capture

01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.280
This is plausible

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.520
And this is probable

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.720
All right, okay. Hold on. I'll down. I'll down. Look come on. No streamer's gonna go without unhinged

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.640
Open

Close okay, it's opening

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:18.200
It's opening drum roll. Come on. You can do it, buddy

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.920
Oh

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.520

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:29.320
Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's loading the logo and we can't see it. Yeah. I'm just like, let me just

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.720
Calibrate the game real quick

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.160
Just a few technical difficulties

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.320
Ah

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.880
Also me this game stood up to the test of time clearly fucking not

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:47.560
Can you lovely jubbly peeps? Can you

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.600
Can you hear there? Is that crunchy? No

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:59.320
Is that still crunchy if not, you're just gonna have to hear my desktop audio instead

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:09.800
Sounds good. Okay. Why is game not on stream stream scream?

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:20.760
Uh game. Hello game game. Would you like to show up, please? Is it because I'm not is it because I'm not in game?

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:23.720

Come on. You can do it. Get it up

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.440
Get it up. Yeah, fucking twat. Why the fuck isn't

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.720
Mm-hmm. Oh

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.720
Oh, no, I'm pretty sure

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:55.960
Assassin's Creed brotherhood is like really problematic to capture in window and I've just fucked it up because I closed it there

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:58.360
Oh

01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.080
Oh

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:06.600
Thank fucking god, I thought I was gonna have to end the stream to like get it to start back up again

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:11.320
Don't ever do that to me again

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.680
Oh my goodness. Oh shit, right chase chase chase

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:20.840
Uh, I used to kill this guy all the get time and not understand why

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.040
I'll go at least

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.600
That in your life

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:33.960
Rip your ears. Is it too loud? Sorry the guards don't like me yet. They're pushing me away. Don't push me. I'll push you

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:40.360
Stream it. Yes me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.640
Thank god. I was so worried

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:47.720
My heart feels full of relief. It is so bootyful

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.680
Um, obviously because of it's an older game you can see the distance rendering

01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:01.240
Not loud just the scream was ear piecing. Oh, okay. Do apologize for that. Sometimes I get a little bit excited

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:04.440
But I'm sure you like it when a girl screams in your ear

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:12.360
Not now Sean not now Sean go away. Get back here. Give me my money back

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:17.880
Okay, there we go. We made it

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:21.720
Did you liberate your money from our friend?

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.920
Week

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.880
They are up and time with work. We'll have a few dozen more depends on the the

01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:35.080
Subject six you mentioned. We'll do that at the end. I don't want to do subject

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:39.480
Now where is my contact Vinicius? He should have already intercepted the letter

01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:42.280
follow me

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:49.640
Okay, we are now riding our horses to roma. Uh, marquiovelli's just kind of spanked us for being like you believe in the people

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:54.680
And it's he goes. Yeah, I believe in the people and then the people just stole a lot of money from us

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.680
But we got it back. That's fine. That's the main thing

01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:04.360
But it's he is starting the concept of the brotherhood of assassins where you take an ordinary citizen

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.120
who is fed up with life who is being treated badly who has

01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.600
Um, just had an absolutely awful time and you've gone. Hey

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:15.320
Do you want to get back at your oppressors?

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:20.200
And then they go, uh, cc because obviously they're italian they wouldn't say yes

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:23.800
They'd say see you and then the good part that

01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:29.080
The best part I would argue about this game starts up from there

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.320
Okay, so we're just following horsey horsey around

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.400
Uh, I love you excelene because I'm like you don't worry. I'm like you in general

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.400
But these are just one of the games that I'm like

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.920
I love everything about

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:48.360
Sees the means of the projection mi amici

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.600
Astroni can relate to being a precious gosh steady on

01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:01.480
Thankfully I was born in a good timeline, but uh, if you didn't know the english tried to eradicate

01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.040
Scottish people many a time

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.280
However, uh, the

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.440
Romans built a wall called hadrian's wall

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.080
Because they weren't interested in going any further into scotland

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.960
They said now you guys can keep it. We're not interested in invading. Yes

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
That's true. That's actually science

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:31.160
Leave my thieves alone you foul beast. Oh that was a bit steady on it

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.360
It's here. What was that? It's so you're supposed to like jump on them

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.280
Okay, well we got countered so I'll just be up. Let's just kick the thief

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.400
I've never had these issues. Oh my god performance. I say

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.880
I can't get up one in three men

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.400
Time me at the term the baths. Okay, we'll find you the baths. Okay, we're about to do a major tutorial part coming up

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.680
But don't worry. It's like a good part

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:05.720
Um, so we're just gonna skedaddle halfway through this. We're currently in the coliseum

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.080
Uh

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:12.600
Coliseum has been wrecked for many a century now. This is very accurate to probably what it looks like going

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:21.000
One in three men, but one in one colfish. How dare you? I assure you my bony

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:23.800
bony can

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.920
My pecker

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.840
Um, it's so easy to get to get engorged

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:42.600
Oh my god, I'm actually gonna announce it any engorgers anyone getting engorged right now. Yeah. Yeah, I bet you are

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.320
Okay

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:50.920
This part if we can do it flawlessly first time so I don't need to be embarrassed

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:56.040
however, the game crashes at this part multiple times for me so

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:03.080
First things first take out your wee knife. Know the big knife. Take out your wee knife. Okay

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.960
For this part that comes up

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:11.320
Because you're supposed to not get hit god damn you can see me river and moon walked into that sequence there

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:21.080
We are about to encounter a second enemy not the border

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.480
Romulae

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.440
Let's see if I can do this without messing up

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:35.400
Okay, pause you have to reselect your small knife because the game always

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.400
Right if I don't get hit I am blessed by the gods because you're supposed to do the sequence without getting hit

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.440
I hate when they attack that blinking means they're attacking

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:55.960
And you can if they have the red hit marker above their head you can't tell if they're about to okay

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.400
We got the 10 in a row serial killer achievement. Oh

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.440
We did it 100% of that

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.360
Oh

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.360
That a bit always stresses me out my heart rate is

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:10.040
Okay, this is a tutorial sequence

01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.160
This is called the

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.400
layers of romulus

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.480
Guy or Romulae if you you want to get techie speaking but Romulus

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.680
Wow

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:25.080
I swear she killed them all with one knife

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.560
So this is timed. Okay. We're on a timer

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:37.480
Um, you will watch me pass up flags and as well as pass up treasure boxes

01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:42.680
Because we will have to come back in 100% this section because in order to get the 100%

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:45.640
Um time

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:48.120
Is what this one is. So we're just gonna

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:54.200
Speed on by we're gonna do a little speedy Gonzalez. I am not going to read chat for eight minutes

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.480
It takes me about seven minutes to do the sequence. The timer is eight minutes. I apologize chat

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:02.680
I can see you rating my burp in the corner of my eye

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:08.200
You must always do the levers in this order in order to maximize your time

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.440
Um

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.880
It is possible that you fall in a sequence and you'll lose time

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.600
Um, but normally I finish

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.960
Roughly 40 seconds to one minute early

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:27.960
Um, unfortunately this game is a bit funner. I've just wasted a bit of time doing that which is a shame, but

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.080
Hey ho, it's what happens

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.160
uh

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:37.880
Yes, obviously you can tell the music's a bit different the I don't know how compose the music or

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:41.000
Do is commission to compose the music very

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:43.080
Very good

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.440
Okay, I can read you for like one second. She hates us. No, I don't need to do the time sequence

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:55.320
I finished early. Oh, I finished early. All right. You want to tell me tell you how early often

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.720
I think I've said this before but um

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:05.080
My record is like one minute and like 54 seconds

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:12.360
Roughly and the only reason I know why is because that's how long the preview was for the video

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:20.920
It was a free preview. I'm just gonna admit it. Sorry, but if you guys are like, I'm so nervous to talk to her in chat

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:22.920
I am

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.920
absolutely not destined

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:26.600
uh

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:28.600
to be

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.880
professional

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.400
or whatever

01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:36.440
But uh, yeah, that's actually true story. I could probably find the video and share it

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.640
um

01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:41.800
If you really wanted to see how good that

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:47.560
Um, we're under a timer so we are just gonna kind of

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:53.960
Right, okay

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.400
You need to look for the open gate and I get it wrong all the time

01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.800
But open gate and then take a no. Oh my god. I get it wrong all the time

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.240
Do you know how many times I've freaking played this game and I do that every single time?

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:07.800
You'd think I'd learn honestly

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.600
One day I'll learn

01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.800
But I have a fun factoid

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:20.600
That I will tell you later once we get to that part of the thingy

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:25.800
But uh, this will not be the only time we are playing Assassin's Creed on this channel

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:29.560
Uh, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on this channel in particular

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:39.160
Um, because I um have very much tizm this game into submission and

01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:45.800
I don't know should I just ruin it? You know what if you're here right now, I think I'm allowed to ruin it

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:50.680
So my birthday is the 10th of october

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:54.120
Um, oh you must always grab this light

01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:01.240
The game will pretend like you can do it. So october 10th is my doughnut on and you'll never guess what date

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.920
Uh gets mentioned in this video game october 10th. So we're playing it on my doughnut on

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:15.640
Um, and I get to nerd about the game all over again, and I'm already beaming with happiness just thinking about it

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.400
I was like, oh no, no, no, no. I'm going to subject you this twice

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:26.600
You you will watch me play this game twice and be so happy about it

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.280
Um

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.800
We're getting close to the

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.640
Main hall the main hall is where the last major part of the sequence comes in

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:43.560
I'm glad the game didn't crash actually earlier because I've not really had I don't really experience any crashing after the wolf section

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.800
Once you've killed all the romuli guys, then

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:50.040
Uh, not once have I had the game crash on multiple playthroughs

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:57.720
Um, this game was literally made for me for real for real like actually though like I mean, how did they know? Like, oh my god, this is

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:03.720
Um for safety, I just follow this. I think you maybe can jump off

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:09.400
There's a fire, but uh, I'm not risking the run. I do not want to play this like

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.920
Section again. It's not boring

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:22.040
Hmm, I'm trying to choose my words carefully as if the dev team are sitting here watching. They're not um

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:29.000
Obviously every game section you have a preference for me being timed to claim about isn't

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:33.560
But I understand that they do have to introduce some sort of element like

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:41.320
Not to panic the player, but if you were just to willfully glide through these areas, then it might

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:43.320
be quite

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:45.320
boresome

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:51.480
Any boresoms? There's a flag to the left. We will not be collecting it. There's also a treasure box up ahead again

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.320
We're not going to be collecting it. We are trying to get our eight minute timer

01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.760
Uh, we have entered a cutscene and we will also have a foot sit there. This is the grand hall

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.760
This is the last section and it's a nightmare if you mess up on it

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:11.480
But uh, I've done it quite a lot. So the CEO of Ubisoft sitting in here like you're doing what to my game

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.920
Um

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:23.320
I always mess this bit up as well. You need to look for this one in order to get inside

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.880
This section

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.480
um

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:33.800
Now assassins creed was made long before the yellow paint

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:41.560
So they use candlelight and fixtures. I'll show you one section that really highlights the the old candle fixtures

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:45.320
Um, we're about to break this so don't be shocked

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.680
I'm quite loud at the breaking

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.760
Bit loud, isn't it night?

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:55.080
Yes, so the game will help you in case you mess up because they have been

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:01.080
They know they've made it awkward. So you saw those treasure boxes. You see that flag there again

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.960
We're just gonna ignore it. We're here for the speed run and we're not

01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:09.160
I actually don't know what the speed run of this game would be. I assume it's probably like under three hours

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:14.200
The first time I played this it took me so long to figure out where I had to go. You have to go on the chair

01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:20.600
Literally the chair and then this little pathetic beam. Do you know how long it took me to find this beam as a child?

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:23.880
Like I started asking my mum for help because my mum plays tomb raider

01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:25.240
and

01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:28.200
And she was like then you look at me straw day and I'm like mum

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:32.680
You're small like I'm a child. You can you must be able to see

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:38.760
You must also grab a lot and to to like save yourself

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:45.400
See, this doesn't look like you should be able to grab it. But if you hold b you can get it. Sorry. I play xbox controller

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:48.280
Uh, I don't know what it is for like ps

01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:50.680
uh four

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:53.240
Is it triangle? No triangles. Why?

01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:56.840
um

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:03.480
And we're almost there. We're doing good for time. We've not actually made any mistakes yet

01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:09.160
Like such as falling off falling off is the oh man. Is she fell off? Okay. Okay, dude. You're done. Um

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:12.440
It's the biggest mistake you can make in these time sequences

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.520
uh

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:19.320
Don't worry the game does try to resurrect you. So this is the freaking jump that I've

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:24.920
It's freaking humongous and it's so no you cannot make that in real life

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.200
But we are perfect for times

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:33.480
Um, and when you pick up the objective the timer stops

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:37.320
So you couldn't theory go back and get all the stuff you missed

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.280
However, I am much more happier to continue on with the campaign

01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.520
But this is a tutorial section that's part of the main quest line

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.160
um for the layer of

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:53.000
Romulus which there are six total

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:58.360
And it unlocks you special armor. Uh, I personally don't actually go

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:01.240
Right, we're gonna pick it up. We're gonna pick it up

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:07.480
So we're picking it up now. So the timer has now officially stopped. We are no longer under the eight minute timer

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:15.320
So I leave my family's armor here one of the finest sets ever made may you who finds it

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.520
Receive strength and battle change of handwriting

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:25.960
We have taken it and set it back behind the iron door six keys unlock it spread amongst our brothers

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.160
It shall be said to come from your Romulus and they will worship it

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:35.800
And we have a picture of the armor that we may unlock at a later time

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:42.200
Again, I don't normally unlock it through my like first playthrough. It's not necessary. It's a bit time consuming as well

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.960
It's probably like an extra hour

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:48.440
So the timer is paused if I pause the game time remaining 133

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:52.600
So yeah, we can pick up all these treasure boxes because we're gonna need it

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.480
you get florins in this game and

01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.000
The campaign actually requires you to have 3,500 florins at one section

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:07.000
Um, and we just want to make sure we go above and beyond because we cannot invest in like

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.920
Properties for example that part comes very soon

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.280
um

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:21.320
How kind of them to write in clear, uh, yeah detail for us to read their, uh, evil plans basically, but there we go

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440
Ancient roman tomowers. Mmm

01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:28.600
Would you like to taste my ancient roman tomow?

01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:36.840
Tomato at golden boy achievement unlock. So we've done one as one layer of Romulus

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:45.480
I'm gonna head off. Thank you for hanging. Please don't worry. I believe she be is coming up in an hour

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:49.400
No in 10 minutes. Who's coming up next?

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:55.480
I'm going to take a drink

01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.600
Is that where the ketchup? No, you're done. You're done. Ben. You're not bad

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:07.560
In nine minutes. Yes. Okay, when she be goes live, please do tell me I will always recommend you guys go watch my gen mates

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.720
Because because I'm an endurance streamer. I'd rather you support them

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:21.800
Are you also an older?

01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:28.520
Okay, this is a beautiful quest

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.280
It's a beautiful quest. It has include revelation. Yes, you play a much older etio

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:38.200
I think you're like 70 years old technically and you're like jumping about paragliding and stuff and it's like

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.040
They really stretch the old dates to make sure they could get them in this

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.680
um

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:50.600
See you tonight when mercy rates into you. Honestly though

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440
Guelph etio

01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:04.600
Brotherhood is etio in his prime for you for it. He's like 42 or 41. I believe in this game a bit of an old man, but hey

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.520
Other bombs

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:15.800
Okay, we're about to unlock the next sequence. It's so good

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.320
So the map of roma is massive, but there's guards everywhere

01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:25.720
So he's telling us if you use the aqueducts, you can move about real quick

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.960
So we are going to use the aqueduct right now to get to island tebarina

01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:35.320
And this is where the assassins are based on on the map in roma

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:42.440
When mercy airdonstream stroneys just finished the intro yapping of the story

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:47.480
Honestly, oh my god, azurid. It's so well on her 2.0

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:55.800
She's fantastic with all her yapping. I think someone said yeah procorn and I was like, well, that's pretty smart. I like that

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:02.040
He's not really in this at all

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:10.360
Fabio, I feel like he might have been dlc content or something. He has two seeds in this game. And yeah

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:14.200
I don't know what

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:19.640
I'd rather confuse

01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:24.920
Her voice is sick

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:30.440
Gee willikers. I wonder why I picked azura. I think we are ready for such an effect for the model

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:35.080
Do you know for instance where the borja troops took katharina's forza?

01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:40.120
What are you also unaware that the borja have captured the apple of Eden?

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:43.160
How could you have lost the apple?

01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:45.400
So you do not know what goes on with our enemies

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:50.440
Do we at least have an underground here to work with no underground network found

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:54.760
Our mercenaries are ensnared in illusory love. He doesn't even talk to me

01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:01.000
We have girls working for us in a brothel frequented by cardinals. Oh my god. It's she be you're in my game

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:05.800
But the madam there is a lot rather attend parties than further of cause

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:08.760
What about the city steves?

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.120
Do they have a deal see but they refuse to talk to us?

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.440
I do not know why

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.760
What are you going to do to make some friends make some friends?

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.480
such a good line

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.800
Because we're about to make three different allies of different districts. We're about to make friends with the thieves

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:30.120
We're about to make friends with the hoes. We're about to make friends with the mercenaries. Let's go

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.400
It's very good

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:37.000
We also unlock notoriety in this as well

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.040
um

01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:45.160
And we also unlock having little uh things achievement unlock from in ruins

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:50.680
Make friends with the hoes to the window

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:58.280
The fighter the lover and the thief to the sweat drop off my boss. Oh skeet skeet mother

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.360
Oh skeet skeet god. You want a scottish cover of that song?

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:07.080
Right we are going to do the eagle point

01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:11.000
Right now just so we can kind of see what's going on around island tibirina

01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:15.480
Please

01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:22.840
Right, so we are going to purposely do the thieves last the reason

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:29.960
For the thieves last is because it introduces notoriety. So guards are going to start harassing us a bit more

01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:33.960
Um heralds are going to start talking about the devious

01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:41.640
Uh acts that xio has committed and we're also going to have witnesses that have falsified their testimonies

01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.440
You didn't falsify your testimony to me

01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:51.080
We've also been introduced to the bank. Um

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.760
Where we can

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.480
Get money for investing in the city every 20 minutes

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:04.840
We will get our little twint or cup from investing in these places

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:07.480
um

01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:12.360
And we have withdrawn four to eight florins. We are rich. We're rich. We're rich

01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:14.920
Any you played that game?

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:18.760
Have you heard about that game that that one game about the the guys that dig in the mines? Right?

01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:25.000
We're going to go to sorry. I didn't want to learn the lore of the bridge. Sorry bridge. Not interested

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.400
We're going to go to the hose first

01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.280
Cause there's thousands of liars

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:38.680
Um and do this quest line. This is the campaign quest that requires florins in order to progress

01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:47.160
However, you can get a very I think you get roughly 2000 florins for doing this quest if you loot the bodies of

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.040
the

01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:55.240
What the heck this place is bourgeois. Should we just destroy rest ever just going to go kill the captain?

01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:58.760
I hope he's not a coward because cowards run

01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:01.800
Oh, he's not a coward. Okay. We're gonna

01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:06.200
Excuse me. Uh, excuse me. Have you heard about this? Have you seen about this? Please don't shoot me?

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.280
Please don't shoot me. I don't have much

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.640
I don't have much uh healing vials on me

01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:17.160
Stop shooting me at least fight me like a man

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:22.760
Come in my face and say what are you you just completely dodged that right?

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:25.080
We're going to heal and we're going to loot this guy

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:32.520
We're going to unlock this area because see how the the map is red. That's because the bourgeois one is

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.160
Joined by this guy. Okay

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:40.920
This looks bad with how much red is on screen. I will get hit. There's absolutely no doubt in my head

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.160
We're going to get hit but it's fine. We're going to deal with it

01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:47.400
We get the big guys first because these you want to kill the big guys in sequence

01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:54.120
Okay, no, we just attracted the attention of that guard over there, which is such a shame. No, we attracted more attention

01:56:54.360 --> 01:57:00.760
Okay, the camera angle gets really bad under here. Oh, no, we attracted more guards not again. It's happening again

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.880
I can't see I can't see

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.040
Stop it. Stop it. No more. No more. Okay. We're fine. We're safe

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.920
No, not the horse. Leave me alone. I hate when they go on the horses

01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:18.680
Okay, okay, air assassinate the horse guy. Okay, we did it. We did it. Okay smooth move smooth move

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.920
No, get off the horse

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:23.320
Get off the horses, please

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:29.240
You're getting you're getting billeted. Boom. That's right. Get off. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, and then we're gonna stab him

01:57:29.560 --> 01:57:36.760
Okay, yeah, the horse is beating him up getting violence getting violence. Get him horse beat him up. Yeah, horsey

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:41.320
Yeah, okay, we're getting a horse feature bar. Let's go. Come on, horsey

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:43.720
Beat him up horse. Beat him up. That's right. Trap alone

01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.120
Okay, we're just gonna kick him to death. Okay. I was remembered to let the body of the guards

01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:53.080
That was amazing. I've never had the horse help me before

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:56.440
Oh, that's fantastic

01:57:57.080 --> 01:57:59.080
Oh in the best of kids

01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:04.200
Uh, there might be an archer on the other side, but it's not a big deal at this point because we have

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.360
Got the thing uh, right. How do I get up here?

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.600
Um, we are going to unlock what's called a leaping glove

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.680
Um, which means we can do very very big jumps. Uh, unfortunately we can't do it at this section of the tower

01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:22.520
So we're gonna have to drop down and reclaim it at a different area

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:28.680
We unlock that in sequence four. I think at the end of sequence four. I can't remember

01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.720
Um, but it means we can jump things

01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:37.320
Very easily and it makes claiming much faster because right now it's a wee bit slow, but it's fine

01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.640
Um

01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:43.880
Time to work. Please enjoy your work. Thank you for hanging out. I'll appreciate you

01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:47.640
That's really embarrassing

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:50.440
He just

He just grabbed over the barrel and rolled over. Okay. We're not even it's okay. We don't need the money. It's fine. It's fine

01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.400
It's fine

so have fun enjoyer and

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:11.560
Uh, uh, oh, this is dead end. I always forget the section

02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:17.960
Uh, normally recruitment's actually spawning those sections and they're so annoying to try and get them do a barrel roll literally

02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:25.400
Yes, oh, I'm getting I'm getting shanked. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm getting picked up by thieves. Right. This wasn't supposed to this

02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:27.400
This isn't a part of the

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:29.160
Leave me like, wha

02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:32.680
For these skinny agile guys, you must take out your small weapon drapes

02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:35.560
Swords as well work, but um, yes

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:39.800
He had so you have to wait until they attack you basically because they're so agile it's such a

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:42.680
And then you can do that

02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:48.520
Oh my god, oh, I don't want the guards to see me with this body. We're just going to go straight into the memory

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.240
Don't want the guards to make the bodies on me

02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:56.200
It was fun hanging

02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.400
Have fun with sheepster

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:04.040
Bye bye. Thanks for hanging

02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.000
Molly stream drift. Ayuto. That means help in attack. Ayuto. Ayuto

02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:20.520
Oh my god, she got her look at her nose. She got a nose job. Look at that peak on that nose. That's beautiful

02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:24.680
I will get her back

02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:27.720
Beautiful beautiful. Oh, I really need to pee. Not gonna lie

02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.600
kind of need to pee

02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:31.640
um

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:34.360
Maybe after I finish this act we can go pee

02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:39.800
If you see top left it says like I've got 5 000 florins, but I need 2.5

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.920
It must be 3k for the banker uh sequence, but that's not yet the banker comes later

02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:47.480
Um banker is a later act

02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:51.800
We are currently doing the lover the thief in the fighter

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.200
um

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.440
Okay, now that I've noticed I need to pee. I really need to pee. Um

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:03.640
Uh brain psychology. Have you heard of this? Uh, do you want to maybe not?

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:09.720
I'm a bit rude. We are just going to run. Normally you can just take a horse over this section, but I find

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.840
They've spawned a wee bit too much

02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:17.320
People to like walk around and the horse really struggles to go in between

02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:22.920
Like the streets, especially if there's narrow sections, whereas xio can just straight up jump over

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:25.320
Uh, so we will be just doing that

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.640
Self-fulfilling prophecy

02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:31.640
I need to pee

02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:38.520
Oh my god weapons if we all pee together at the same time, but we like affect the water like flush system

02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.160
Why did you take out the sword xio? I

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.760
He just poked him in that eye xio. That was that was a lot. Oh

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:53.320
Whoopsies. I actually didn't mean to do that. I literally just smacked my mouth. I didn't mean to kill him

02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:00.600
I'm sorry. You're just trying to get your paycheck for your wife and kids and I've just like literally made made her a widow

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:04.040
Oh

02:03:04.040 --> 02:03:07.160
Don't really feel good about that one. Uh, so this is a bourgeois on

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.640
It's actually really annoying

02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:16.200
Do we do the bourgeois on before we do this?

02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:22.120
Oh, no, we won't I can't be arsed. We'll come back to this zone. It's a lot easier when you have recruits

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:24.680
Have you come for the whore?

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:27.320
close enough

02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:33.480
It's what happens at football halftime. Oh, I heard that

02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:37.160
What? Oh my god

02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:43.880
I don't remember this part right again. No way. Did you see the four things behind me? Soldiers are about to board this boat as well

02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.480
Okay, you must loot the bodies. Oh, I forgot to loot the bodies. Oh, that's fine. Oh

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.320
Why are the freaking

02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:59.400
Energy pro, okay

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.080
So we're gonna look at the bodies of the thieves because they normally have unique items like elephant ivory

02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:08.440
Uh, 200 coins. I thought it was a bit more than that

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:14.200
Yeah, vlad then paler coins. Um, these items can be traded at shops for special items

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.640
Who goes there identify yourself? Um

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:26.920
And after completing this quest we unlock courtesans which can distract guards

02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:33.480
They are very vital to a later campy a later sequence

02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:40.120
Uh, actually the banker sequence, uh, which I previously mentioned is when they are vital and a part of the gameplay

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:44.920
You can also get favors done by them. I don't mean like that because they're courtesans

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:47.240
I mean like

02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:52.600
So the base price to hire a group is 150 florins, but if you wow them

02:04:53.080 --> 02:05:00.760
Uh, you can get a discount rate of 75 florins. I've made that sound so weird. I know but it's the gameplay

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:09.160
Um, the thieves if you upgrade them and impress them the thieves will pickpocket naturally as you walk through clouds

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:16.520
But it's a little bit more. It's not awkward to get the thieves favor. They just have a few more unique. Um

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:20.840
A few more unique things you have to do

02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:25.640
I will explain it when we once we unlock it. We're about to unlock it right now and it'll make more sense

02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:32.040
Um, but we're basically making generic allies and soon we will make brotherhood

02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:36.200
Allies which are assassin allies and they will help your gameplay

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:40.920
if you feel like you are a weak gamer or you're just not there with it with time in and

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.400
Like things if the games are going too fast and you're like, I can't keep up

02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:50.680
This is the kind of game for you once you know what you're doing and get used to the controls

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.080
because once you unlock assassin recruits

02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:59.160
Your life is so much easier from there. It's it's bliss. It's a dream

02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:06.040
It's one of those games where not everything has to be on you in order to progress and that these are my kena games

02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:12.680
Okay, I don't want to feel stressed out. Uh, if I don't hit that you can quickly loot this little box that's on the balcony here

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:19.480
Uh, 75 for a whole group of them. Damn. No wonder strongy only was 100 for the ASMR

02:06:19.720 --> 02:06:23.000
Booth, could you imagine if a con would let us do that though?

02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:25.800
I think we'd get kicked out

02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:29.240
I'm not gonna lie

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:36.280
Not that I'm insinuating anything would occur in the booth, but I feel like

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:41.720
Things may go hand quickly

02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:44.760
Uh

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:48.520
Oh, is there sister and her mom they're in roma now

02:06:52.520 --> 02:06:54.520
You cannot close I need your help

02:06:56.040 --> 02:07:03.320
Good morning. Good. Good morning. Good afternoon and good evening. Oh, yes. Good morning. Good afternoon. No, good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. There we go

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:05.480
That's

02:07:05.480 --> 02:07:08.520
This is different. What alternative do you have?

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:13.160
So claudia is currently she be cotton bum because she's about to run a brothela

02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:15.640
I've been on the blooming rose

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:22.360
Why do these ladies have horns that was the style back and then they did their research

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:24.680
These are the hairstyles

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.200
at the time

02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:28.680
Good morning. Good evening. Good night. Did I say the wrong way?

02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:31.560
far

02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:34.600
I'm a wee bit slow

02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:38.280
So we are now about to renovate this lovely location

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:44.840
And our sister claudia is going to run it and we now have favor with the courtesans

02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:50.760
Uh, the rose that infuriate the blooming rose or something like that. Um

02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:55.800
There's a flag at the top. You can actually see it shimmering right now very slightly

02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:58.840
Um, but we're about to go inside

02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:00.520
but

02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:02.520
Jen too called the blooming rose

02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:05.080
honestly

02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:08.600
There are cons in Glasgow that would let you do xd

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:13.880
We were talking about like actually coming to physical cons

02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:18.280
Rosa infior

02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:20.520
Um

02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:25.400
Okay, this

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:31.720
The border make it difficult for claudia's girls

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:35.320
There are several things you could do that would aid them

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.880
You can do side quests for the brotella with your mom or whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:46.760
No

02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:49.480
No, she assigns you a quest

02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:56.520
You do not do a quest with your mom and they get okay

02:08:57.480 --> 02:08:59.480
Ah

02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:01.160
Apologies

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:06.600
Right. Okay. So as I was talking about you can kind of level them up. You can be given assignments

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:10.840
So right now it costs 150 florins to highlight to hire a group of girls

02:09:11.160 --> 02:09:12.600
um

02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:16.200
Send 10 guards distracted hide bodies

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.440
poison

02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:24.040
Assassinate from blind spots assassinate from behind smoke bomb with not unlocked smoke bomb yet that comes later

02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:30.280
But you can do these and gain favor with the factions and it makes your gameplay a lot easier

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:33.080
um

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:35.480
Right next we are going to

02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:43.000
Actually factually do the mercenaries, which is this one. I'm just highlighting it on the map. So I don't get confused

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.400
Yes, it is very far away

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.200
Um, however

02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:50.920
Well, we can just

02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:52.040
Run there

02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:56.360
I think I can't take a horse and I cannot take the aqueduct because

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.320
As soon as you summon the horse you basically get walled off by the layout of the map

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:07.400
Which is fine because we're literally in an area where people are supposed to be living and thriving and doing things

02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:10.520
So yeah, horses aren't really supposed to just roll all the way through

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:15.880
Though this is a lost memory of the girl that got away, but we're not going to do it right now

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.640
We're going to do it at the end. I do apologize if you're really interested in the story

02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:22.360
uh, what's her name?

02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:24.920
Christina is her name

02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:27.480
Um, but that sad part comes in later

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:35.240
Uh, it is a very unfavorable and sad memory. So I like leaving it to the end. I'd rather just focus on the happy times

02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:39.320
Hey, only 500 more meters to go

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:42.920
Uh, Christina, I knew it was Christina

02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:50.440
Yeah, this game as much as I'll meme about the render distance like as soon as you get closer to someone

02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:51.880
I've just

02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.880
Added so much time going this way, whatever. Um

02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:59.880
I'm like, I'm trying to find the main freaking road, but I can't find it. It's really annoying

02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:02.840
Okay, I found the main road and I'm about to go off it. Yippee

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:08.920
Oh, I didn't mean to do that. I swapped him out a sword. Oh, this entire zone's red and I'm not strong enough to kill him

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:12.120
We are

02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:17.320
Then we just run through the area to save us time to be honest

02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:23.400
No, no, I'm not stopping. You can't make me go away. You stink

02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:25.960
Stinky stinky guard

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:30.760
We'll come back once we unlock recruits. Um, I can't get over your accident. Thanks. I spawned in with it

02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:37.480
Uh, if you'd like to visit Glasgow, please do please support our economy because it's in absolute shambles in the UK

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.840
Um

02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:44.840
Maybe I should do that. Maybe I should like plan a trip if you ever came to Scotland

02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:47.880
And I'll be like you should go here and you should go here because I've been here and I've been there

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:49.560
um

02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.560
That'd be cute

02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:53.560
um

02:11:53.560 --> 02:11:55.560
The order is an acquired taste. Oh, yeah

02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:01.320
Stinky, uh-oh stinky. Okay. These are the French

02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:08.280
What do we think of the French? What do we think of the French? We think they're fish. They smell. Sorry

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.480
There's like a football chant. That's like, what do we think of the French? I can't remember it

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:15.480
But it's like, what do we think of the French?

02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:17.800
What do we think of the French?

02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.120
And Glasgow is nice while you visit it glad you didn't get stabbed

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:29.640
The one of the highest rate places to get stabbed. However, rate is one of the friendliest as well in Europe

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:32.040
Of all of Europe. I don't know

02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:34.280
But

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:39.240
Okay, we made it. We made it. We are about to meet Bartolomeo

02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:41.880
the

02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.200
owner, I guess of the mercenary guild

02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:54.840
Water check

02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:56.600
Bartolomeo

02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:01.400
You have to meet my wife Bianca. Oh, no, fantasy. Yeah, Bianca's a sword. Sorry

02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:04.360
His sword of his name is Bianca

02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:09.400
Did you check behind the table? Okay, that's a reference to Assassin's Creed one. Just so you know

02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.920
Pantasy day. Ah, don't mind the bad dude on Chantay

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:24.360
I still haven't harassed Amy with my French, uh, Scottish French accent

02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:31.960
I should force her to make an ASMR French collab with me, but I like purposely put my accent

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.280
On and she's just cringing in the corner

02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:41.400
Don't forget to stretch. Yes, uh, I will need to educate you guys

02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:46.840
On why we need to stretch our legs to make sure we don't have a bit who veins

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:52.200
Our position is weak

02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:55.000
Then we can concentrate our forces on the French round

02:13:56.920 --> 02:14:01.560
Thank you for disclosing this to me Madonna Dalviano. It is the least that I can do to help her

02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:07.160
So I will educate you right now my lovely jubblies

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.040
Did you know overwhelmingly the people that suffer from

02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:16.680
Hemorrhoids, which is a failure of a vein in your booty hole

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:21.880
As office workers because they sit down for long periods of time. So I always recommend

02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:28.840
Stretching often or standing up. We are all about to go for a pee break and I recommend you all get up with me

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:35.960
Um, sorry that I never explained that mission there if you kill only the captain you get 100 percent super simple easy

02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:37.960
And you can also pick up a flag on the way

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.640
Uh, so yes, uh, we desire to not have any issues with our booty holes

02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:47.240
So I will recommend we stretch roughly every two hours

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:51.560
Um, I have no idea how long I've been streaming for but we should probably do it soon

02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:57.880
Um, the guards will not harass you at this area. It's super easy and you can pick up this a lot of treasure box. It's full

02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:07.080
Yes, um, uh, it's quite interesting like the knee this sounds absolutely bizarre

02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:10.520
But the nature of hemorrhoids is quite interesting

02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.760
Because it's literally just what side am I supposed to climb up? I can't get up there

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:21.160
Um, it's literally just a vein in your booty hole. That's you know failed and there's nothing really more to it

02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:26.840
It's just like adios I'm out and then that's what hemorrhoid is and you just get a cream and

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:29.160
You know put it on your butt and then it goes away

02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:34.280
It's really bizarre or if you're someone like it's a really a shame. I've like heard stories like people who suffer

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:37.400
Uh, you need to like get on operation on your butt

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:39.000
but

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.440
um

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:42.440
Yeah

02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:43.960
I don't know. I just

02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.960
Sorry, I'm just vomiting about like biology and diagnosis and stuff. So, yeah

02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:58.280
I am not expecting these topics of conversation and sorry, I do apologize. Do we go left or right here? I actually

02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:00.840
I think yeah, we were supposed to go left

02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:02.840
Okay

02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:07.320
The butthole Lord. Yes, you you will have the healthiest booty hole

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:10.040
Uh, enjoying my streams

02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:11.960
because

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:13.960
We will have healthy butts together

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:15.880
Uh

02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:19.480
Okay, first synchronize the viewpoint and then ignite the board of tower

02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:23.640
Do not ignite the board of tower first because the viewpoint will

02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:29.080
Not register and you will have to claim the tower all over again. Once you have done a tower

02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:31.160
You never have to go back up it. There is no

02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:36.760
Treasure chests added on top of the tower. There are no flags added on top of the tower

02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:39.480
um

02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:41.480
yes

02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:47.480
Don't worry. I love every second of your conversation. Yeah, I do like my conversational topic

02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:54.520
Uh, the game will always give you a way up fast if uh, they've kind of put you in a thingy

02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:58.840
Because they literally leave you in the water after that sequence and I was like, okay, then I guess

02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:04.040
We will call a horse very quickly or we'll steal a horse, but a

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:08.200
A really strange developmental fact is

02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:13.320
Um, depending on the horse's color depends on its speed in the game

02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:17.960
The lighter and whiter the horses the slower it is

02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:24.280
And then obviously it goes up to all the way to a black horse and a black horse is the fastest horse you can get in the game

02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:30.280
I don't know why the developers did it like that. Um, but I noticed it as soon as I like started playing the game

02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:33.880
I was like, huh, why did they do this? It seems like such a random thing

02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:35.640
um

02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:38.440
But we're on a dark brown horse, which is the second fastest

02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:44.280
So we got here lickety split, but if you can somehow memorize the speed of that horse when we get on a white one

02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:47.640
Uh, yeah, it'll be so slow in comparison

02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:52.200
Now that the popes dogs have fled we're talking about horses still, right? Yeah

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:59.320
It's dread play the game. I will show you literally. I don't know why the devs don't know

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:02.600
Well, that's a true fact. Oh, I don't that's group

02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:10.840
Oh, yeah, I'm all I can got restricted and I had to pass like a 10

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:15.960
Second like 10 captures and I can't be bothered doing it. So my account's just restricted right now

02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:17.320
I'm so freaking lazy

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.320
It like makes me do like these 10

02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:25.160
Things over and over and I failed it the first time and I'm like go ahead and stop playing

02:18:26.120 --> 02:18:33.160
Like, you know, Phil will I'm a human all I did was retweet someone artwork of me and then it blocked my account again

02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:35.880
I've done it like three times now. I keep getting it like

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:42.120
Horses are like cars red cargo first

02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:52.440
Again, uh, same thing as before if we improve the mercenaries they get cheaper

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:58.440
I don't know if they get more effective cannot prove that. I don't know if they get more aggressive and successful

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:04.120
Bit silly in it. Yes, it's silly

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:08.360
BRB got walk home. Please do not get snatched on your way home

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:18.200
The red ones go faster

02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:20.520
So

02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:29.800
Oh, we're unlocking assassin mission contracts as well you get some florns on the side super easy super quick

02:19:29.800 --> 02:19:33.800
If you unlock your assassin signals and do these really fast, not problem

02:19:39.880 --> 02:19:43.160
Uh, we will do a pee break in about like five minutes time

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:44.920
Okay

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:51.320
Now we are going to be able to utilize the aqueduct in order to get a lot closer because if you see the meters

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:57.720
It says we're 1000 meters away. We go to the island Tiberina. That's the closest we have unlocked to the thieves at the moment

02:20:00.040 --> 02:20:02.040
Yeah, it wasn't kind of the market

02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:05.240
Is that that might be true

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:11.640
I actually don't know if they get more plentiful the like higher you under your the higher like tier you are with them

02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:14.600
We

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:16.680
If

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:22.520
Jesus almost just killed myself from that board there. You're goodness. All right. They came out near we have

02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:27.960
We do have to run for this but again, unless I take this guy's horse. You don't want mine now

02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:31.480
Thank you very much

02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:34.760
Please okay, my way

02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:39.400
So this is the problem if the if you gallop through crowds the horse will fall over

02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:42.600
But if you just sprint through crowds the horse won't fall over

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:46.200
Um, literally we committed grand theft horse

02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:48.120
Say

02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:53.800
Apologies to that guy. He probably spent thousands of florns on the horse and I've just ran away with it

02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:56.360
And you get to keep the horse

02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:02.120
Uh, I've still not unlocked targets. So we're not gonna do that. We're just gonna swim across the water really quick

02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:08.280
We the pirate ship always stays after you have done that. I don't know why

02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:15.560
But the asset does get reused in a Leonardo mission. So it's not like a massive waste

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:21.960
So we are now currently trying to run out of range of the horse that's across the water because if we call on it

02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:26.840
It's gonna try and okay. There we go. We're out of range. So we can spawn in the horse at any point

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.400
But uh, it will try to come over from the other side of the water and it can't

02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:36.760
So you need to go out of range to despawn it and then you can respawn it on the other side

02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:41.320
Fuckin hell this horse is zooming. My god. What kind of hay did we give it?

02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:48.040
It's so fat. Why are we going so fat? I need to help it. Oh my god

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:54.840
That was dangerous. Oh, that was dangerous. Like didn't even got a helmet on. He's not even got any crash pads on

02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:59.000
I'm surprised to see you. This is Laval pay the owner of the tea skilled

02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:02.360
Horse doping honestly

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:07.000
The answer you always do you want to put my spies to work

02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:10.040
Sippy check

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:15.640
No, thank you. The horse be like gotta go fast. Should have made it blue like sannic

02:22:16.440 --> 02:22:18.440
a serious allegation

02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:22.120
Bang bang

02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:24.280
Give a wee baggie to the horse

02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:26.520
Wee baggie is slang for

02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:29.800
I also know he abandoned you right before the

02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:34.600
Yeah, I think you can you can get the rest from there. He is an assassin

02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:37.240
Not a traitor

02:22:37.240 --> 02:22:41.400
I am not convinced. What a wee baggie means

02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:48.200
Care to accompany me

02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:54.360
So Laval pay thinks that marquia velly is a traitor to the assassin's guild

02:22:54.600 --> 02:23:00.680
Which is the reason why Laval pay refuses to communicate with marquia velly

02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:05.800
Can I get a horse please because this is going to take a while to get to the location we need to get

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:09.560
Let's go

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:13.400
Right, let's get out of the way of the humans because the humans are in the way

02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:16.440
um

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:21.880
After this we gain notoriety unfortunately, which means they're going to be

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:28.920
Posters put up about us and they kind of pop up on the map a bit too a bit too much and they're always like above

02:23:31.160 --> 02:23:32.840
Money

02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:36.440
How we are we're at six thousand that's not honestly, that's not bad

02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:40.280
Um, we are going to try and get a crossbow ball

02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:42.840
You can unlock a crossbow ball just like the archers

02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:50.120
But you need to pay for it and I think it's 13 000 florins and if you decide to invest in buildings

02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:57.080
Like boot. I keep saying butchers like the blacksmith for example. Um, it does like

02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:02.760
It adds up over time, but it kind of is a bit difficult

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.120
It's better to like save your money for the quest because you can easily defeat the section after

02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:14.280
Oh, you like my twitter picture. Yeah. Yeah, I totally made it myself

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:18.280
I did not

02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:20.840
I didn't make it at all. I yanked it

02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:23.560
Okay, okay

02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:25.560
This pay attention

02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:28.680
Look at his body and look at him holding his arm

02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:33.080
Please make note of this as his and what sounds crazy

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:37.720
But i'm going to talk about reusing assets and how genius it is in video game development

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:45.000
Okay, so he is hunched over and he's holding his arm. Please keep this in your mind. Okay. Let's see if I can shoot everyone

02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:47.240
You first

02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:49.800
Right you next

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.720
Right you next

02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:53.720
Okay, you know

02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:56.040
How about you? Okay. Oh

02:24:57.800 --> 02:24:59.000
Oh

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Hey, let's go, baby

02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:09.640
Do you guys see the behind of the scenes and lord of the rings where gimley's like right you first right you next you'll come to me

02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.080
I'll beat you up right you next right you next. That's basically what we just did

02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:17.320
Okay, now this section is actually super easy. It was really hard at first

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:21.560
We might get caught because i'm it's he gets lost so quickly

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:28.440
But basically you have to hide here and then we're going to wait for a group to walk up

02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:32.120
And then they will see that group there

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:35.560
That's coming towards us. We hide in that group and then that's it

02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:39.160
We've done this section of the game, but please make a note of his body

02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:42.040
How he's holding his arm and he's kind of hunched over

02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:45.480
Because i'm going to show you a reused asset you might not know about

02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:50.920
Wait, why why is that group highlighted? Hold on a minute. Am I supposed to be with the other? There's too many groups

02:25:51.480 --> 02:25:52.600
Please

02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:54.600
Please okay you

02:25:55.400 --> 02:26:01.640
Okay, I hate this bit because the tree gets in the way. Yes, you heard me right the tree gets in the way and breaks up the group often

02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:04.600
But we're just gonna blend in

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:09.720
Don't look at us guards. We're just citizens. I'm a monk

02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:14.040
Amen, amen. I don't know what monks say

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.400
And then

02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:19.400
Oh, excuse me

02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:21.480
You are right there and he's like

02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:25.880
That could have desynchronized because he got caught on those people. I'm not even kidding

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:33.400
Analysing asset analizing

02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.080
Will this asset be reused later? Yes, it will

02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:43.240
You know how to disappear

02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:57.800
Okay, we are going to take a pee break right after we've done this bit because I need to pee

02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:00.040
He he he

02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:03.560
And i'm gonna get more water because i'm out of water already

02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:06.280
So these are witnesses

02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:10.040
We lose 75 percent notoriety if we do that

02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:12.840
And we are also going to complete a thieves challenge

02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:20.760
Which is drum roll, please is to pickpocket 500 florins and a really quick way to do it is by this

02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.560
You pick bribe him 500

02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:25.720
And then yank

02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:27.800
Easy come easy go, baby

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:36.600
Uh and then oh, I still have notoriety. Um, that's not supposed to happen. It's supposed to disappear at this point

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:43.400
Excuse me whilst I kill this other witness. Oh, no, there's guards. You know what? I can deal with the guards. Yank

02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:50.040
Ah

02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:54.840
I'm a good citizen. I promise. I'm just a scary scary monk

02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:57.800
You've got the wrong man

02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:03.080
Everyone else wears hoodies. Okay, it's not just me. Oh, I'm like running into more enemies

02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:12.200
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold the phone. Hold pause. Pause. Pause. Oh pause pause pause

02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:17.080
We did it. We did it. We snuck on him. Oh my god, we snuck up on him

02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:22.520
Oh my god, it's normally so hard to do talk about opportunistic killing my goodness

02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:25.640
Okay, we've just secured her like a third board to tower

02:28:26.680 --> 02:28:29.960
Oh my goodness. I can't believe the timing just happened

02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:37.400
Oh, that was perfect timing. I could not have asked for better. Oh my god, I could not have asked for better

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:39.800
Is he still trying to oh he just drowned. Okay

02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:43.000
Oh, that was amazing. I'm so happy with that

02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:50.280
Okay, we're gonna burn this tower. There are a few archers on the roof, but uh, they're not too much of a bother

02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:52.600
All right, you can just kind of you know

02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:56.440
Unfortunately, you do have this one's a bit more awkward. You have to like

02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:01.320
You have to like kill him and then you have to go up there and kill this guy too

02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:06.360
And it's a bit annoying to navigate. Whoopsie. Oh, wow. I made that jump

02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:10.440
There's a guard down there, but you don't have to kill him if you don't

02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:13.800
Get down. No

02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:17.320
I will take your get down get down. Oh my god

02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:22.360
Oh

02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:27.320
You know that song that Japanese one you heard of this you heard of that thing

02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:33.880
Oh, maybe if we get 3d models, we can all do that trend get down

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.800
Right, we need to find the synchronization point for the map boom synchronization

02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:47.240
Yeah

02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:51.000
I used to watch a lot of hadsunimiki MMDs

02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:55.160
Like dance and stuff and that was the first ever exposure

02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:01.400
Pretty much I got

02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:06.040
So I have another sipping tin of cola

02:30:10.840 --> 02:30:13.240
Oh, my ankle just cracked. I don't know if you heard that

02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:16.760
If I got picked up in the make my ankle just cracked

02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:20.040
Because I'm sitting on my 15th

02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:26.200
I'm wiggling my toes right now. That's right. What are you going to do? You're going to try and stop me? Exactly. You can't

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
I'm just a little toe wiggler

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:37.960
Okay, uh, we'll get a horse. We'll complete this next but I think we have to defend the thieves guild and upgrade it

02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:43.080
And then that was I was done with DNA sequence three question marks

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:45.560
Ah

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.640
There are nine dna sequences in this game

02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:56.200
And they're all perfectly leveled out, but we are getting very close to being out of the tutorial section very very close

02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:59.400
I believe

02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:01.240
after act

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:03.240
five

02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:05.960
We are officially a tutorial and his own

02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:09.640
What a knight of these has a toe wiggling street

02:31:09.720 --> 02:31:11.960
Listen to me. I know what we saw

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:17.240
But you have nothing to fear from Machiavelli. What was the streaming page you watched mmds from?

02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:22.920
I just youtube like had to meet you dancing and like tato. I like tato

02:31:24.840 --> 02:31:29.640
Um, who else did I like? What are the thieves? Ah, what's the yellow one called?

02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:33.400
Goodness me I've forgotten her name

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:37.480
I would like to know it not lin and brin to make sure the border just stay away

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:41.320
Perhaps it could look like I forgot the yellow. No, not kagaman

02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:46.040
I like that idea. Teto hats and miko and the yellow one

02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:53.480
Okay, renovating the thieves guild. Oh, sorry. I just called on the horse by accident. Sorry horsey. Please don't come

02:31:56.040 --> 02:32:01.320
Um, am I gonna? Nero? Nero! Nero! I think her name is Nero

02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:04.280
No, it's not a boy

02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:09.880
Right type in hats and miko teto and it's like beep beep beep and it goes

02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:18.040
Nero! Akita! That's her. Yeah, like Akita

02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:22.520
Not Gumi. Uh, Gumi never really appealed to me. Sorry

02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:26.120
Nero! Nero!

02:32:26.120 --> 02:32:28.120
Yadomiku with a one-point help basically

02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:31.800
Uh, I like

02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:39.160
Ah, yes, I forgot. We also have gamba. It is a great source of income

02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:44.280
Especially, but we gamble all the money before I go for a pee just for the heck of it

02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:50.600
Your hair looks like water, man, melon, candy, watermelon, sugar

02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:59.400
I actually quite like it. Um, because Amy's ginger. She's our yinya. If you're scouts, she's our yinya

02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:04.200
So I didn't like want to have like orange orange. So I'm very vibrant in my clothes

02:33:05.240 --> 02:33:08.600
Okay, we're just gonna gamble the money and then we'll go for a pee

02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:14.120
Okay, what I yeah, but what I do though, I actually I've never played this game

02:33:16.120 --> 02:33:18.120
Oh god, what I do

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:26.680
First rule rule the through the seven seven eleven suck a dick or a ball sack

02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:29.560
It wins the game without payroll

02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:35.640
I'm all in max wager have absolutely no clue. Let's go

02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.200
Did I win

02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:44.200
Did I lose that all

02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:54.200
Yeah

02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:56.680
Did I win

02:34:03.160 --> 02:34:07.800
Oh, no, I'm just gonna have to play more assassin's creed with you guys then

02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:11.800
Oh, no

02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:14.200
Oh, well

02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:20.520
Okay, is this the end of the sequence? No, okay, we're gonna unlock the place

02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:28.440
Roma is doomed literally can't play landlord simulator in assassin's creed brotherhood. I am doomed

02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:32.680
The house always wins do not gamble

02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:38.040
Did I tell you that one time I got offered a lot of money to do a gamble at

02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:45.160
True story, uh, it was one of the biggest sponsorship offers I've ever received

02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:51.000
And I saw they offered the money first like in the email. They were like, this is how much we'll pay you

02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:53.560
um, and I was like

02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:59.800
Oh my god, I've never never been paid that much money before and then it was a gamble ad and I'm like, oh, that's that is why

02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:01.720
uh, so yeah

02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:11.960
How much money uh four thousand us dollars for a one minute advertising segment of a gamble advert a site

02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:14.920
The biggest offer I've ever had

02:35:15.480 --> 02:35:19.480
Uh, which was pretty insane. Uh, so we're just gonna finish the sequence and then we're all gonna be

02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.280
Yes

02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:23.720
and

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:26.760
But will it pay for all the fallout? Yeah, literally, uh

02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:29.800
I was I'm like

02:35:30.680 --> 02:35:32.680
Obviously some people are

02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:37.400
You got it from a guard good guess

02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:44.280
To terrorize roma

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:48.200
How do I find them? I can give you a general location

02:35:48.840 --> 02:35:55.080
I suggest looking for signs of distress nearby. Oh, perhaps you will uncover citizens. This isn't the end of the sequence

02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:00.600
I'm gonna wet myself. I'm not gonna lie. I've had like three glasses now

02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:07.480
Okay, I think I just need to hire two more recruits and then we can all go pee

02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:10.120
Claudia

02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.840
I have no idea

02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:19.320
I can do I can do I can do I can do virtue

02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:31.320
Okay, this is the claudia thing you must pay for mario stand

02:36:37.640 --> 02:36:39.640
I'll pee right now. I don't think I won

02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:44.600
I'm gonna do I'm gonna pee I'm not gonna pee

02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.720
Opportunity to assassinate the marizas will I take it? Oh, do not repeat your mistake

02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:10.280
Okay

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:15.480
It absolutely does not come across like that, but my brain

02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:27.320
Okay, it's this act almost done. Yes, we're gonna fix the aqueducts in roma as well. The briefings are right here

02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:34.360
Can I say something really bad

02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:39.080
I thought about being a don't a son reward a little

02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:42.920
apple juice or

02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:46.120
homemade slime

02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:50.840
I don't know if that's terrible or not

02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:57.240
But like I thought it would be funny if it was like you can have apple juice or homemade slime

02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:59.480
What would you like from this the cuttlefish?

02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:02.040
Um

02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:08.600
Because and it would be extra funny because I actually have really smelly apple juice

02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:11.960
So someone can inhale it and be like

02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:20.520
Okay, we did it fix her upper act four is when we get the brotherhood together officially

02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:25.320
I'm gonna let the game run in the background because it'll actually generate us income a den of thieves

02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:27.320
I have apps. I can't even remember what's in them

02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:33.800
Oh, no, is this when we go to the castello? I think this is a castello mission

02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:38.840
Right, I'm gonna let the game run in the background because it'll generate me some money in the background

02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:44.920
Please everyone, uh, get yourself new drinks if you need water or fizzy juice or whatever you may drink at the moment

02:38:45.240 --> 02:38:50.840
Um, please get up and stretch. I am with your peep. I will be roughly three minutes. I'm gonna maybe get a snack

02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:57.160
I actually boil this I boiled some eggs in preparation of this stream so I can grab a boiled egg and eat

02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:59.320
There's a snack

02:38:59.560 --> 02:39:03.880
Because I don't have time to like make fit fit so I have boiled eggs. Okay, right

02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:06.360
I'm gonna let the game run in the background, but I'll meet my mic and all that jazz

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.800
I'll open it like I'll open the game back up. So it's not just like pause pause, but I go pee

02:39:27.160 --> 02:39:29.160
Oh

02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:59.160
Oh

02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:29.160
Oh

02:40:57.160 --> 02:40:59.160
Oh

02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:20.200
La carita

02:41:27.160 --> 02:41:29.160
Oh

02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:48.040
The dragon

02:41:57.160 --> 02:41:59.160
Oh

02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:29.160
Watch yourself

02:42:57.160 --> 02:42:59.160
Oh

02:42:59.160 --> 02:43:01.160
Oh

02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:03.160
Oh

02:43:31.160 --> 02:43:33.160
Oh

02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:03.160
Oh

02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:29.160
Right I'm not being funny who here's a doctor because my piss was neon

02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:35.320
I'm like, is that really have bad and dehydrated?

02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:43.320
Oops, I'm currently eating a meat stick. I was gonna get the egg. Oh, I don't have enough money. Oh

02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:48.520
Glowing the dark honestly

02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:55.160
Right, we're gonna unlock the I keep wanting to call it the butchers the blacksmith

02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:02.360
Did you guys pee and get water and stretch your legs instead?

02:45:05.720 --> 02:45:07.720
I don't even drink energy drink

02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:22.120
I'm eating meat and trying to play at the same time my mouth is stuffed full of meat. Oh

02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:24.200
Oh

02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:28.360
Beat your bars when they're trying to like do the most clippiest beat clip of ever hair

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:31.640
Oh, my mouth is so full of meat

02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:39.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it. We get it. We know what game you're playing. It's fine

02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:48.920
Okay, I'm finishing up. Sorry for the people that don't like mouth sounds. I apologize

02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:58.120
Actually can't remember what happens in this sequence. My brain is blanking

02:46:02.680 --> 02:46:08.920
Well, it looks like I certainly should have taken the aqueduct because all right, we're going into the castello. Okay

02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:11.640
we're about to go

02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:19.000
See katharina of for Lee katharina. What's up for Lee? Um, she's currently stuck in a jail

02:46:19.320 --> 02:46:21.720
She's she got the jail. You know polis got um

02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:24.920
Say police and scott polis

02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:28.520
Actually, that's how you say it in uh gaelic as well. You say polis

02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:35.080
What are you eating? Uh, I said like a meat a stick of meat. Um, it's like a pepper ramy

02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:42.600
But it's called uh twizzle stick or something. Oh, shit. I don't want to get in trouble. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:46.200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Just part. Excuse me. Pardon me. Come through. Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me part

02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:48.200
I

02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:50.440
That's what I didn't want to happen

02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:52.840
because I'm literally just trying to get into

02:46:53.480 --> 02:46:55.480
a memory right now

02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:59.800
Excuse me. Pardon me. Didn't mean anything. Right. Well, that was your fault. You could have ignored me, but no no

02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:02.040
Oh, are they still looking for me?

02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:08.600
So that indicator means they're still looking but they've not been coded to come down the stairs or something because yeah

02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:10.600
They should have came down there, but they didn't

02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:13.240
Well, I ain't complaining. I never got in trouble. He

02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:16.200
Fuck you now. Do you see that flashbang?

02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:20.680
How does Haggis taste? I actually really like it. Um

02:47:21.880 --> 02:47:23.880
She whore of fourly

02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:32.440
I drinking lots of water to stop the neon

02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:45.560
Don't speak ill of the border

02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:49.640
It was Haggis. Haggis is a meat dish

02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.360
Keep your eyes on her eyes

02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:03.800
Girl spitting fire

02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:08.680
Haggis is a meat dish a native national

02:48:10.840 --> 02:48:12.840
It's not a national dish, I don't think

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:14.600
Um

02:48:14.600 --> 02:48:16.840
Who goes there? Um by the pope, um

02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:23.000
Sorry, I ain't and I had a bit of water. So that didn't work. Um

02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:25.880
It is

02:48:25.880 --> 02:48:28.840
I believe sheep liver and sheep lung mashed up

02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:34.840
Uh, and it's quite peppery and quite a peppery dish. Um, it's really nice

02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:41.880
Uh, you might have heard the phrase neeps and tatties. That means potatoes and turnip and it's just like a nice mash together

02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:47.320
It's really nice. I like it. Okay. So this one's like don't get caught but I couldn't be

02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:53.800
What will do the do not the don't get detected later because I actually don't even know how to do it

02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:58.360
So we're going to do it for the first time together. I've never done this section without being caught. So

02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:03.240
I assume maybe if I had a crossbow and it can kill from afar and resupply

02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:08.360
Isn't Haggis a wee rodent? Oh, I is a wee animal. Um

02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:15.480
She cannot waver Haggis is mainly pork, is it?

02:49:18.680 --> 02:49:24.200
I don't think it's easily accessible like outside of the united kingdom

02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:31.880
Um, it is referred to as blood pudding. Oh, no, that's black. Uh, black pudding is different. Um

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.320
For breakfast we do like, um

02:49:36.680 --> 02:49:41.400
It's a discus. So on the way I just a discus of um

02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:46.040
It's called black pudding, but Americans refer to as blood pudding

02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:51.800
But it is made of blood. So I do understand why they call it that. It's just we call it. It just sounds a bit barbaric

02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:54.440
But at the same time it's like, well, we are eating

02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:58.120
You know, I mean

02:49:58.120 --> 02:50:00.120
No one cares

02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:05.320
Greetings greetings. You really say greens?

02:50:05.640 --> 02:50:07.640
Uh

02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:14.440
Right, let's kill him from above. Thank you very much. We are gonna have to come back on this

02:50:16.760 --> 02:50:20.120
Haggis is a savory pudding containing sheep's

02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:24.600
Sheep's pluck minced with chopped onion oatmeal

02:50:25.240 --> 02:50:28.360
Spices and salt mixed with stock and cooked with traditional

02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:32.680
I don't know how I could do that in the corner of my eye, but here you go

02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:37.240
I actually played this game so many times. I'm like completely sequenced out the weather

02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:44.120
But yeah, I'm a bit confused how you're supposed to do this section without being caught without a crossbow

02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:46.760
I think we'll get access to the crossbow when we replay the memory

02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:53.160
Oh, no, go away. See that's the oh my god. No, no, no

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.880
By the skin of our teeth

02:50:58.680 --> 02:51:00.680
Did that man not shoot?

02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:04.120
Oh my gosh

02:51:05.640 --> 02:51:07.640
By this skill

02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:12.280
By the skin of our teeth by our gamer skills as well. Yes, I give it to my gamers

02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:18.040
Oh my gosh, must have been the wind literally

02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:21.640
Their brother and sister by the way

02:51:22.600 --> 02:51:24.600
Oh

02:51:30.280 --> 02:51:32.440
How it looks so

02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:34.440
I'd rather like it open myself

02:51:37.480 --> 02:51:40.360
Have you talked to the pope about the funds requested by my banker

02:51:41.160 --> 02:51:45.560
He is away from the castello. I do need some convincing when he returns

02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:48.440
That shouldn't be a problem

02:51:49.400 --> 02:51:51.400
I wish that was me for real for real

02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:57.560
It's a little time together

02:51:59.160 --> 02:52:01.160
Other conquests

02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:12.760
We'll be a thing of the past. I shout baby

02:52:13.240 --> 02:52:15.240
Oh

02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:17.400
Up at here yonking

02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:19.000
We tag this up

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:22.280
We tag the stream up to high heaven. We've got here yonking. We got kissing. We got

02:52:23.400 --> 02:52:25.080
Bendest

02:52:25.080 --> 02:52:27.080
A lot of things going on

02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:31.880
Uh, right. I'm not to go up. I think I'm just swing to the side. Yeah, surely

02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:34.920
Imagine if I went the wrong way

02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:40.280
Right now, right. So hold B and then yeah, you just grab on to everything you can kind of speak things of it

02:52:41.240 --> 02:52:43.240
And

02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:48.280
His ball was like one black thing shriveled up or something like that

02:52:49.800 --> 02:52:51.800
That spanyard guy

02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:55.160
Spanish were well then

02:52:55.960 --> 02:52:58.840
To even get to that stage. Uh, not gonna lie. Not gonna lie. Uh

02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:03.480
Who goes there identify yourself

02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:06.840
What do we need to go up

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:11.560
Square sausage. I miss square sausage if you didn't know

02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:17.560
In cheeky scotland for breakfast you do square sausage and it's literally a square of sausage meat

02:53:18.680 --> 02:53:24.360
And it's that wish it I have it on a roll way onion. How is the journey to roma?

02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:33.160
I can't remember your pathetic lucrezia. What did he talk about his plans for napoli? Did you like it?

02:53:33.160 --> 02:53:36.040
I can't remember. Perhaps you will remember this

02:53:37.720 --> 02:53:39.720
That's what you in your place

02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:41.720
Whamming on whamming violence

02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:45.560
It can't be

02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:48.360
Oh, you can put like tomato sauce on it's like tomato sauce

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:50.680
fried onion

02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:55.320
In square sausage on a roll soon simple simple brave simple

02:53:56.360 --> 02:53:58.360
Can you get more simple on that?

02:53:58.680 --> 02:54:05.320
Right on the hip as well like, uh, excuse me. Uh, sorry that actually really hurt and I need to say for it

02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:07.960
Please that actually really hurt. Please don't do that again

02:54:08.520 --> 02:54:10.520
Lucrezia Borgia

02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:16.920
Right, I'm pretty sure for this sequence if you time it right you can be like not detected by the guards somehow

02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:19.720
Yeah, like literally he doesn't yeah

02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:25.240
So at least we know that for when we do play the 100 not detection segment

02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:28.440
And then there should be a guard to our left

02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:34.200
Well, we we don't need to not be detected right now. So it's fine

02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:38.040
The safe word is more

02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:41.080
What do you think is still it was being the safe word for

02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:44.200
a sheep's skate

02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:51.800
Okay, kill that guard first and then kill him and then that'll be how we won't get detected surely

02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:55.960
Yay castello crash

02:54:59.880 --> 02:55:03.000
Brown sauce and I'm not brown sauce fan sauce

02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:07.000
Is a bit of harry polter sauce with hp

02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:09.960
It's that sauce or ketchup

02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:13.160
I'm gonna say something really dumb

02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:15.560
I don't know the difference between

02:55:16.120 --> 02:55:19.080
Tomato ketchup and tomato sauce and tomato ketchup

02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:22.040
Ain't they the sale? Aren't they the same?

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
Aren't they the same?

02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:29.960
Phil's sink failed. Yes, we will be coming back to fully sink at later thing right now

02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:35.080
Um, oh my god that per guy. I didn't even know he was in here. I thought she was the only one here

02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:38.040
um

02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:40.840
Brand one has sugar one doesn't

02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:44.680
I guess tomato sauce is probably what I like then

02:55:46.440 --> 02:55:50.280
Uh, this is this section can be a little bit finicky. Uh

02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:55.160
I want to sing it from the heavens

02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:03.480
Who knows what he would do these holes in loyal

02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:10.680
He killed my my husband. Oh

02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:14.040
For real for real

02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:19.000
Nope ketchup has way more sugar than other ingredients. Oh my god, not kidding

02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:25.960
She got a point ketchup has a ton of sugar. Okay, whatever the sugary one was. I like it. Okay, brain says yum

02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:32.120
Yes, oh

02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:34.200
She playing she said

02:56:34.760 --> 02:56:37.880
Guess what? I'm not the only one that's going cheating around here

02:56:41.720 --> 02:56:47.640
He loves me. No, I don't think he loves you him. Oh, she's like actually animating the flower and stuff

02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:52.280
Hello

02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:54.680
Imagine counting flowers and someone just goes

02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:57.320
Wow

02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:00.920
Oh my god, I think I would have a heart attack

02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:08.120
He would have enjoyed this guards

02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:15.800
Jump on you and say, oh, that's what happens in the ASMR booth. Well stays in the boost. Well happens with boost stays in the booth

02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:22.840
I see that premium pass around your neck. Yank. I'm jumping on you. Okay. Thanks for supporting me

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.840
All right, we're just gonna have to wait for these guys to attack because they are such a nightmare

02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:32.280
Literally it's just so much faster to let them attack and then

02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:38.440
Right, oh

02:57:38.520 --> 02:57:40.520
I think I just next

02:57:42.040 --> 02:57:44.040
The jump scare

02:57:45.080 --> 02:57:47.080
Foxy jump scare

02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:50.360
Princesses from castles now

02:57:51.320 --> 02:57:53.720
All right, all right, right

02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:58.920
So this is really awkward if Lucretia gets away like back to that starting station

02:57:59.560 --> 02:58:03.400
She will spawn out of bounds and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it

02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:06.680
And you have to restart this section again. It's so annoying

02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:12.040
Uh, thankfully, uh, the last few times I've played this game. It's not happened

02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:14.360
But when it does happen is so annoying

02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:17.560
Oh my god, it's so annoying Lucretia

02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:26.440
Um, if you can get excuse me, I wasn't even putting her down and you just whacked me with that freaking weapon. Stop it

02:58:27.720 --> 02:58:29.720
You're upsetting me

02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:37.160
Don't upset me. Oh my god. Please do not do a finishing move if she gets away because I was busy doing a finishing move to look

02:58:37.240 --> 02:58:39.240
Really good

02:58:39.720 --> 02:58:41.720
The passing was your hand was finished

02:58:43.080 --> 02:58:45.080
And their memories are raced

02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:47.320
Oh no, the tombstones are raced

02:58:52.840 --> 02:58:57.160
Uh, see she does that see if she jumps out you have to go grab her

02:58:57.800 --> 02:59:04.200
However, if the people are attacking you then she'll wait on the side patiently for you to kill them

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:09.720
Oh my god, is she actually getting away? I'm getting nervous. Stop. I'm getting nervous. Okay. No, she's she's saying so

02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:11.960
Stop it. Lucretia. Lucretia

02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:17.960
Hey, hey, calm down. Let me just kidnap you. I mean come on. Come on. Let me just kidnap you. Okay

02:59:18.680 --> 02:59:20.680
Let me just kidnap you

02:59:21.880 --> 02:59:23.880
She like it really come on

02:59:24.280 --> 02:59:29.240
Look your man's no gaining any attention and look at me. I'm picking you up. I'm throwing you a boot

02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:32.760
This is exactly what you're wanting. Hey, look at this. Yeah, I didn't face that

02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:35.320
Didn't I? I don't face it

02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:37.320
But I'm willing to see them

02:59:39.080 --> 02:59:41.960
Okay, that's right. That's right. Just accept that

02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:46.760
This is so weird. I'm sorry

02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:55.160
My words are wasted. Hippocrita. No, no, come on

02:59:57.080 --> 03:00:00.600
Okay, we did it. My words are wasted here. Hippocrita

03:00:00.600 --> 03:00:04.600
Salute, Lucretia. Just kidnap me, Strony

03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:09.800
Oh

03:00:10.040 --> 03:00:15.240
Crank sale. Those are some big words. You're not supposed to say that stuff. Oh bib sweat detected

03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:19.400
Strony be taking tips from mercy

03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:22.760
That's enough

03:00:23.720 --> 03:00:25.720
Can you walk? No

03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:29.240
Hey smart camera bin. Yes, we are going out the front

03:00:30.200 --> 03:00:32.200
Okay

03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:37.480
Do not be detected again another do not be detected, but there's two guards literally dead ahead

03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:40.680
How am I not to be detected by them when we play this for real?

03:00:41.560 --> 03:00:43.560
Did they come in here?

03:00:43.880 --> 03:00:46.840
No, this cannot be. Did they actually come in here?

03:00:49.640 --> 03:00:51.640
Okay one

03:00:52.120 --> 03:00:54.120
Is

03:00:55.720 --> 03:01:01.720
No, okay, how am I supposed to deal with two of them at once when we do it for real?

03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:11.320
Uh, you better calm down hen. I'm rescuing you Christina. Didn't get on at me about taking so long. Where are you going?

03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:15.320
Catarina

03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:20.600
I can't wait to hear your ASMR streams. Oh, it's just absolute word vomit. I promise you

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Absolutely, nothing makes sense

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:28.520
Uh, my accent gets a little off the wee bit when I like whisper, but it's not really a big deal. Like I can make it like I can

03:01:29.160 --> 03:01:31.160
enhance

03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:36.200
All about that

03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:41.320
Yes, yes, yes, I know you gave me your hole so I'd protect you. It's oh

03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:45.560
Hello. Bye. Bye. Hello. Bye. Bye

03:01:45.720 --> 03:01:47.720
Bye

03:01:47.960 --> 03:01:49.960
I do be a really skilled assassin

03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:53.640
Ready

03:01:55.800 --> 03:01:57.800
Don't you dare

03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:04.760
He's just like me for real for real. He literally went

03:02:08.280 --> 03:02:10.440
We're actually it's an auditory confirmed

03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:15.160
Never do that to me again

03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:20.600
Man, they didn't even let her put on her dress and stuff. It's all torn at the bottom

03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:23.240
Oh, also you can walk on barrels

03:02:23.800 --> 03:02:27.000
If you wanted to know that you can like jump up on barrels while carrying people

03:02:29.640 --> 03:02:32.360
It's just like a silly little goofy thing, but I like it

03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:40.360
Okay, we pop you down there pet the eagle and then we just give a wee stabby stabby the eagle all for you, mate

03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:42.920
and we just pick up the lady again

03:02:43.720 --> 03:02:45.720
And then basically

03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:50.440
If you pop her down in the middle, I think you can access both gates without losing

03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:52.280
distance

03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:55.640
It will warn you against distance if you get too far away from her

03:02:56.280 --> 03:02:58.280
But

03:02:59.480 --> 03:03:00.760
Um

03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:05.800
No, I was gonna walk away. I was gonna walk away and you forfeited your life

03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:13.160
How could you be such a silly you know, I think we actually might have to move her over. Whoa

03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:15.960
Did you guys see what I just saw?

03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:22.920
Oh, leave me alone. No, no, you don't see me. I'm just going up the stairs. I'm just a tourist. I'm a fissure. Okay. I'm a fissure of the

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:29.240
I thought I was gonna desync there. I got scared. I thought I was gonna

03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:33.960
I saw her her panties

03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:39.560
And I didn't even have to pay anything. I saw them for free

03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:47.960
Wait, can that guy see me again? Oh, uh, I think we're gonna have to do the old uh ear assassination

03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:55.080
All right, can we hey, uh, excuse me sir sir. I just moved over to do an ear assassination. Thank you

03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:58.200
Okay, there we go

03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:01.400
The audio is strange again. It better not be

03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:03.720
Why

03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:10.680
Why I literally nothing has changed

03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:20.360
I'm gonna tab in and out of the game multiple times. Okay, so it's gonna like pause and then open back up and pause and open back up

03:04:25.400 --> 03:04:27.880
There's a steak noise sound like a steak review

03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:33.160
If I have to close the game again, I will

03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:43.000
A decent warning like it sounds perfectly fine for me still there

03:04:51.720 --> 03:04:55.160
Do I have to play this whole section again if I quit right now it's still buzzing

03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:58.200
Do you know what buzzing means in scott's it means you're really

03:05:01.080 --> 03:05:08.360
A feature I know has this you can just restart the audio capture. I mean right hold on controversial move. I know

03:05:11.640 --> 03:05:15.800
How does that sound does that sound normal?

03:05:18.600 --> 03:05:21.480
I am now capturing my desktop audio instead of the game

03:05:22.440 --> 03:05:29.720
Okay, I I can know you're literally gonna hear if one of the girls DM me on discord. That's the only thing

03:05:32.280 --> 03:05:35.640
Okay, let's get across rich risky. I know you're all gonna know that I'm

03:05:36.360 --> 03:05:39.320
I've I've arranged another ASMR collab

03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:43.640
Uh, like literally 30 minutes before the stream started

03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:49.400
I like burst into someone's DMs on twitter and I was like, hey girls. Do you want to add me?

03:05:50.360 --> 03:05:54.360
I thought I was talking to her about ASMR collab and I've already planned it

03:05:55.160 --> 03:05:58.520
It's not a big ASMR it goes on her channel and all that jazz, but yeah

03:05:59.800 --> 03:06:03.080
Okay, uh, we have a timer. We basically just have to survive

03:06:03.720 --> 03:06:09.160
So this is where you can get the serial killer achievement again, but it gets a bit iffy

03:06:10.680 --> 03:06:12.680
It's not the best. I will mess up

03:06:13.640 --> 03:06:18.040
And we're the enemies go away citizen. I don't want to kill anymore

03:06:20.360 --> 03:06:25.640
Uh, I'm going to try and kill the wee guys first because they grab me like that and ruin my streak

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
Okay, sorry, I'm focusing

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:35.400
See when they grab you it takes you out of your kill streak advantage and there's lancers as well

03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:38.040
I can see that lancer. I'm going to try and take him out in the kill streak

03:06:38.920 --> 03:06:40.680
okay

03:06:40.680 --> 03:06:44.120
I'm trying to get the lancer and it keeps all into the other guys

03:06:45.800 --> 03:06:47.080
Come on

03:06:47.080 --> 03:06:48.840
wee guy next

03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:55.320
Armor guy next I guess he's probably the best, but okay. I can't break his armor. So I'm just gonna go for the wee guy

03:06:57.560 --> 03:06:59.000
Okay

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:04.440
We're getting there. We're getting there 30 more seconds. Do not grab me. I hate when they grab me. Oh

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.800
No, no, no, not the horse. Not the horse. Not the horse

03:07:10.040 --> 03:07:12.280
I said I'm hiding from the horse get me in the hay bale

03:07:13.880 --> 03:07:18.440
I'm scared of the horses. I actually don't know how to take down horse guys

03:07:19.720 --> 03:07:24.680
Ah, ouch. Yeah, this is why I don't like the horse guy. We've got seven seconds

03:07:24.840 --> 03:07:28.680
We just need to not get hit because we can run away in two seconds

03:07:29.720 --> 03:07:32.040
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay

03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:39.080
Oh my god

03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:45.400
Okay, so in this sequence you just need to get out a range of the yellow on the map if you come on the roof

03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:49.800
Uh, you can basically run along it as much as you need

03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:57.000
Or if you don't like rooftop scaling there is boats down to the left where you can get out a range

03:08:00.840 --> 03:08:04.760
Bruh, bruh get off my roof. No

03:08:05.480 --> 03:08:11.640
Uh, and then if we disappear in the water, maybe I think we can hide in the water

03:08:12.440 --> 03:08:14.440
You can like literally hide in the water

03:08:15.880 --> 03:08:17.880
I'm a call fish. Let's go

03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:20.840
Can they see me?

03:08:20.840 --> 03:08:22.360
I'm

03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:31.400
Physically, yes, they can see me, but uh game development wise. No, they can't so uh, I enjoyed that do that again more game, please

03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:37.480
Okay, we're gonna kill this guy. Sorry. I'm sorry mate. Your time is up

03:08:37.480 --> 03:08:39.480
Oh

03:08:39.640 --> 03:08:42.200
I forget. Okay. If you scare away

03:08:42.920 --> 03:08:47.800
You won't be able to right. We're gonna go for this poster just because I don't want guards to attack you on site

03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:54.840
Um, if you are the highest notoriety, they will attack you. Um, and it is very oh the poster is down here

03:08:54.920 --> 03:08:59.400
I have been I've been fooled. The egg is on my face. Uh

03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:02.280
right

03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:04.600
We need to now go back to

03:09:05.560 --> 03:09:07.560
The island tied out

03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:09.880
because

03:09:09.880 --> 03:09:11.880
Catarina's forces

03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:13.560
and

03:09:13.560 --> 03:09:19.400
Then we can unlock assassin recruits and then we're really gonna get into the meat of the game and I love it

03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:23.080
And everything is so cool. Everything's so awesome

03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:27.320
Uh, we're just gonna all right. Here we go yank

03:09:28.600 --> 03:09:31.080
He said enough a young come on for her enough

03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:34.040
enough

03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:36.040
Is it enough?

03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:38.040
Don't you not want to give more?

03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:46.360
Okay, this is the only problem when navigating what a horse you have to can

03:09:46.920 --> 03:09:51.240
You're like stuck to using whatever roads have passed out and it gets really um

03:09:52.440 --> 03:09:54.040
finicky

03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:56.040
It's a bit

03:09:57.080 --> 03:09:59.080
You know what I mean? Is this a bank? Have I unlocked it?

03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:07.080
How would you bother you just gone down to it folks?

03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:10.600
If you come on the roof should you click?

03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:14.440
I never even said that that was you that said that

03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:22.120
Normally, I'm the one coming out with the outrageous. Uh, I just whistled for the horse whilst purchasing the bank

03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:29.800
Hey horse, can you come out here? Thanks appreciate it like oh, okay

03:10:34.120 --> 03:10:37.720
Oh, we made 1.5 Florence

03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:40.280
That's pretty good

03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:44.200
I don't think we're gonna get the crossbow before the section that i'm hoping to get it by

03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:50.600
Uh, I don't know why we lost all our money. Don't know how it happened something something don't gamble at home people. Uh

03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:54.040
But may have lost all our money in that

03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:56.760
Uh, right where is the bridge?

03:10:57.800 --> 03:10:59.800
Bridge is over here. Okay

03:11:01.080 --> 03:11:03.080
Got a stile in them peasants

03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:06.760
Horse is the first customer of the store for real for real

03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:09.480
Munching on that. Hey

03:11:12.760 --> 03:11:14.760
Okay, we have made it to the island

03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:21.640
Never gamble with your own money gamble with someone else's that's terrible. Don't gamble all

03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:25.080
Save that mula

03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:31.000
Get yourself a weave as ages from the corner shop. Maybe are we bakery? Are we scorn?

03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:37.640
Looking for it in the bank. What's the cesarean rodrigo?

03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:43.320
Cesarei rode out before I could get close to him and rodrigo was somewhere else entirely

03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:45.880
That is odd

03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:47.880
rodrigo is normally at the castle

03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:50.760
Very odd indeed

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.640
What a waste so levopey thinks

03:11:54.600 --> 03:11:58.360
That marky velly tipped off cesarean to leave the castle

03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:01.240
So we're all suspicious right now

03:12:02.200 --> 03:12:08.840
Impossible cesarei commands a massive army in romagna. You would never reach. Thank you. I say we work here

03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:10.520
What?

03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:13.240
They rode the borja's influence while restoring our own

03:12:13.880 --> 03:12:18.840
And in fact, I want to make it right now. Yes. We're doing it

03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:22.440
Machiavelli, meet me outside

03:12:23.320 --> 03:12:25.320
Take care of her

03:12:26.040 --> 03:12:31.000
We're doing it. We're about to get the brotherhood. Come on reeflings. I want to turn you guys into assassins

03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:34.200
I'm gonna turn you to deadly weapons

03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:38.040
The borja rob everything from the people to maintain power

03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:41.160
What do you intend to do?

03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:46.120
We will recruit him to our cause. You cannot be serious to win this war machiavelli

03:12:46.200 --> 03:12:50.600
Win the loyal soldiers. Come on reeflings. You'd let me draft you right?

03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:54.760
All right, let's get drafted

03:12:56.040 --> 03:13:00.520
I'm gonna be the combat medic on the battlefield. Okay. I'm healing you guys on the battlefield

03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:03.320
with my

03:13:03.880 --> 03:13:08.040
Oh my god, the cutscene took so long that wait

03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:16.040
Whoa, I've never seen this happen for two recruits spawned and the cutscene took so long. They both died in the instance

03:13:16.600 --> 03:13:18.440
Oh my god

03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:21.560
All right, she's still alive. Let's save her. Oh my god

03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:28.840
It's shrek and no, no, no, no. We've just attracted more guards. This is terrible. She has incredibly low health

03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:30.280
Oh

03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:33.080
Goodness me. Oh goodness me. Oh goodness gravy

03:13:34.120 --> 03:13:38.680
Please don't perish. I hope she doesn't perish because we're actually gonna have to okay. We she didn't perish like goodness

03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:42.200
Already sold my life

03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:44.680
What did you sell your life to?

03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:48.280
Sin

03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:53.800
It's a lady assassin. You'll never guess what I do to the lady

03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:59.560
Okay, we're gonna open up the map and the map will tell us where the next recruit is so we can go recruit this person

03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:04.760
And now we are about to unlock

03:14:05.480 --> 03:14:11.000
Assassin recruit signals, which means in the middle of a fight we can literally ask the game to help us

03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:13.800
And there's also a really fun minigame

03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:18.440
Where you can level them up and make them even stronger to the point where they can fight

03:14:18.600 --> 03:14:21.960
Incredibly strong enemies and it is so satisfying

03:14:22.600 --> 03:14:28.120
Watching their health bars go up. Oh, look, I have it already actually. I'm gonna use it for

03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:32.600
This citizen if I can get to them in time before they perish

03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:35.560
and

03:14:35.880 --> 03:14:40.120
Uh, here we go. Oh, it's another lady. Oh my god. We're like doing all ladies in this

03:14:40.840 --> 03:14:43.320
Assassin group. Oh, oops my bad

03:14:44.040 --> 03:14:46.040
You can't really oh

03:14:46.520 --> 03:14:51.800
Oh, okay. Oh, hold on. Let me go. Let me get up. Okay. We're oh my gosh

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:55.160
This has increased brotherhood more like the sisterhood

03:14:56.120 --> 03:14:58.120
Am I right? Ha ha

03:15:01.320 --> 03:15:04.680
Hopefully we can get a few guys in here. We need to repopulate roma. You know what I'm saying?

03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:10.680
Uh, let's unlock the doctors because we can get more money in general

03:15:11.640 --> 03:15:16.520
The strong door calls for aid. Oh, me on Christmas like

03:15:18.280 --> 03:15:20.280
Okay, I have a new lead base cure for syphilis

03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:23.320
What did he say?

03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:29.960
I don't think I've ever heard that. I've got a new lead base cure for syphilis

03:15:30.760 --> 03:15:32.760
I didn't know that was in the game

03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:35.640
That's outrageous

03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:40.840
Right, we're going to go pick up this other assassin recruit because they're like a hundred meters away

03:15:41.720 --> 03:15:49.080
Uh, that's absolutely hilarious. Um, and we're also going to send one of our assassin recruits away on a mission

03:15:49.880 --> 03:15:56.360
Which is how you level up the assassins and you get a stupendous amount of money for it. Um

03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:05.560
So I get 650 florns for six minutes. I send this person away for so this is your biggest money maker is sending your assassin recruits away

03:16:06.120 --> 03:16:11.320
Um, so we may be able to get the crossbow ball if I dilly dally and do a few safe place things

03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:15.400
Uh, or we can just brush through the it's not really brushing because

03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:18.440
It's just playing the campaign. But yeah

03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:22.920
I'll have to say nothing is true. Everything is permitted for real

03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:30.040
I'm training my reeflings to become weapons of destruction. Where's the citizen?

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:35.080
Oh, they're already fighting. Oh the citizen might die

03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:44.360
Oh, why is this building so tall? Oh, can I get them? Can I save you? I'm coming. I'm coming

03:16:45.320 --> 03:16:51.720
I'm helping I'm helping okay. We got it. We got it. We got it. Okay. Good. Oh, no, there's more guards that come in

03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:53.880
Oh, I don't know how low his hp is

03:16:54.440 --> 03:16:59.400
The recruits. Oh the recruits. The recruits are so bad at the game as well. I'm so bad at the game

03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:03.080
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. No

03:17:03.080 --> 03:17:04.960
Oh, oh, oh, come on, you can do it.

03:17:04.960 --> 03:17:08.160
Okay, oh, oh, we did it.

03:17:08.160 --> 03:17:10.240
I instantly, you want to pick up the recruit

03:17:10.240 --> 03:17:13.160
because it gets rid of any guards that are nearby.

03:17:13.160 --> 03:17:16.000
Mirigracia, Mirigracia, Mirigracia.

03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:17.920
And for the right reasons, it seems.

03:17:17.920 --> 03:17:20.760
Could you use another blade by your side?

03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:22.880
Weapon of instruction.

03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:24.280
Achievements, brotherhood.

03:17:27.580 --> 03:17:28.720
If we had gamer score,

03:17:28.720 --> 03:17:31.160
we'd probably have like 200 venerals.

03:17:31.160 --> 03:17:33.680
Oh, these are the Borja zones that we've liberated.

03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:35.040
We've done three places,

03:17:35.040 --> 03:17:37.440
so we're allowed to have three recruits.

03:17:37.440 --> 03:17:39.520
We've done four places, excuse me,

03:17:39.520 --> 03:17:41.600
so we're allowed to have four recruits.

03:17:42.560 --> 03:17:44.120
I literally just remembered.

03:17:45.760 --> 03:17:50.040
We can go to the main quest, which is down here.

03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:54.080
There's actually someone we can recruit over here.

03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:55.680
Nah, we'll go to the main quest

03:17:55.680 --> 03:17:57.000
and we'll pick up recruits on the way.

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:58.600
We've got a fill bar of recruits.

03:17:58.600 --> 03:18:00.280
Unfortunately, they're very weak,

03:18:00.320 --> 03:18:01.680
so it's not very good.

03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:03.360
I'm chasing after you, my recruits.

03:18:05.520 --> 03:18:08.960
It's not very good to send them to battle

03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:11.080
without kind of leveling them up first,

03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:13.560
because your recruits can perish in a fight,

03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:14.640
unironically.

03:18:17.600 --> 03:18:19.720
Yeah, your assassins can die.

03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:21.160
It's very dangerous.

03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:27.060
Across the bridges are our first mission.

03:18:27.060 --> 03:18:28.800
These missions are all based around calling

03:18:28.840 --> 03:18:31.200
your assassin recruits in,

03:18:31.200 --> 03:18:34.240
but the bar does take exactly 60 seconds

03:18:34.240 --> 03:18:36.760
to refresh from when they disappear,

03:18:36.760 --> 03:18:37.920
not from when you call them in,

03:18:37.920 --> 03:18:39.760
from when they disappear off the map.

03:18:40.760 --> 03:18:45.760
And some of the missions, they take a hot second.

03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:49.040
It's good to get multiple bars of assassin recruits,

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:50.760
so the more Borgia towers you destroy,

03:18:50.760 --> 03:18:52.520
the more recruits you're allowed,

03:18:52.520 --> 03:18:56.560
and you've got a maximum of three bars,

03:18:56.600 --> 03:19:00.200
so six Borgia towers.

03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:02.160
Where the heck am I going?

03:19:02.160 --> 03:19:04.520
Oh, this one, I remember.

03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:07.800
Hello, sorry to swing in about that over this very sad scene.

03:19:07.800 --> 03:19:10.320
Oh, my fatal.

03:19:10.320 --> 03:19:13.000
This is another multiplayer character that we kill.

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:17.280
We must follow the hose.

03:19:18.480 --> 03:19:21.200
So they will point to where we need to go,

03:19:21.200 --> 03:19:23.680
but I have played this game many a time now,

03:19:23.680 --> 03:19:26.480
so you can't just keep running in general.

03:19:27.320 --> 03:19:29.880
Running, running, running, running, running,

03:19:29.880 --> 03:19:32.800
running, running, running, running.

03:19:32.800 --> 03:19:35.640
Yeah, we do have our recruits ready to assassinate this guy,

03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:38.960
and we should get a taity sum of money for doing so.

03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:43.160
So running, running, running, running.

03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:45.320
I've actually never tried to break this sequence

03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:47.920
and go outside of what the girls point you to.

03:19:48.840 --> 03:19:50.840
Um, yeah.

03:19:50.840 --> 03:19:54.080
So I've called my recruit.

03:19:54.080 --> 03:19:55.400
I don't know where she is.

03:19:55.400 --> 03:19:56.720
She's taking her sweet time, right?

03:19:56.720 --> 03:19:57.720
There you go.

03:19:57.720 --> 03:19:59.240
Get him!

03:19:59.240 --> 03:20:01.800
And then we've 100% of that already.

03:20:01.800 --> 03:20:02.640
I'm going to shower.

03:20:02.640 --> 03:20:05.040
Hold on, let me pause the stream for you.

03:20:05.040 --> 03:20:06.040
I'm teasing.

03:20:06.040 --> 03:20:07.160
Enjoy your shower.

03:20:07.160 --> 03:20:08.600
Don't forget to do your belly button

03:20:08.600 --> 03:20:09.760
and behind your ears.

03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:11.600
A lot of people forget.

03:20:11.600 --> 03:20:13.680
And make sure you soap all over,

03:20:13.680 --> 03:20:16.400
even on your booty hole, soap cleans itself

03:20:16.400 --> 03:20:18.480
due to the nature of it.

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:24.320
Not that you're expecting a visitor any time soon, are you?

03:20:24.320 --> 03:20:25.040
Eh?

03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:26.360
What?

03:20:26.360 --> 03:20:27.680
Ehehe.

03:20:27.680 --> 03:20:30.600
Um, do you get a lot of money if you loot?

03:20:30.600 --> 03:20:33.200
No, you don't get anything if you loot the multiplayer.

03:20:33.200 --> 03:20:34.800
Ooh, new recruit, let's get it.

03:20:36.880 --> 03:20:38.800
Oh, oh, oh.

03:20:38.800 --> 03:20:39.840
No, they're fighting.

03:20:39.840 --> 03:20:41.840
Stop fighting before I even get there.

03:20:41.840 --> 03:20:43.480
My goodness.

03:20:43.480 --> 03:20:44.240
Stop it!

03:20:44.240 --> 03:20:45.280
Stop it!

03:20:46.280 --> 03:20:47.520
I'm coming to hell.

03:20:47.520 --> 03:20:48.360
Give me a second.

03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:49.600
Let me cook.

03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:52.840
Oh my god, I've just invited even more guards to come over.

03:20:52.840 --> 03:20:53.960
Oh, please don't.

03:20:53.960 --> 03:20:56.520
I don't know how damaged it is.

03:20:56.520 --> 03:20:59.000
Please don't do a cutscene.

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:03.800
There's too many enemies around right now for this.

03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:06.360
Oh, oops.

03:21:06.360 --> 03:21:08.520
I am actually going to pick up these bodies

03:21:08.520 --> 03:21:09.920
and put them in the hay bale.

03:21:09.920 --> 03:21:11.920
Because if you put five in a hay bale,

03:21:11.920 --> 03:21:14.000
you do a cortisol challenge.

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:15.120
I'm just going to do this now.

03:21:15.120 --> 03:21:16.480
So I'm not going to talk to them.

03:21:16.480 --> 03:21:18.680
I'm literally going to save his life and then just be like,

03:21:18.680 --> 03:21:20.520
excuse me, I'm just trying to hide the evidence of what

03:21:20.520 --> 03:21:21.840
we've just committed together.

03:21:28.840 --> 03:21:30.800
Mother Mary.

03:21:30.800 --> 03:21:32.920
No, not the sword, the body.

03:21:32.920 --> 03:21:34.840
No, the body.

03:21:34.840 --> 03:21:36.520
Thank you.

03:21:36.520 --> 03:21:37.760
No requiesce de parte.

03:21:41.560 --> 03:21:43.880
And one more body should do it.

03:21:43.880 --> 03:21:47.000
No, not the weapon, the body.

03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:49.000
Taking up the trench.

03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:52.000
Taking up the trench.

03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.240
OK, there we go.

03:21:54.240 --> 03:21:55.400
You know what always bothered me?

03:21:55.400 --> 03:21:57.000
When you kill some evil bloke and then

03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:01.720
Exo is cradling like a babysitter recipe, he has.

03:22:01.720 --> 03:22:02.960
Whoa, what was that?

03:22:02.960 --> 03:22:04.960
Was that scaffolding in that cutscene?

03:22:04.960 --> 03:22:06.240
Can you help me?

03:22:06.240 --> 03:22:07.440
I would gladly fight for it.

03:22:07.440 --> 03:22:09.160
The camera is so good in this game.

03:22:09.160 --> 03:22:12.680
Like it's so busy.

03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:17.320
Do you guys remember the asset repeating?

03:22:17.320 --> 03:22:21.240
I'm going to show you an asset that was repeated right

03:22:21.240 --> 03:22:23.080
in this next quest.

03:22:23.080 --> 03:22:27.720
So remember how he was holding his arm and he was injured?

03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:29.320
Well, guess what?

03:22:29.320 --> 03:22:33.680
This is where they reuse the asset on this little crying kid.

03:22:33.680 --> 03:22:36.360
Don't worry, there's not a random kid crying in your headset.

03:22:36.360 --> 03:22:39.240
It's part of the game.

03:22:39.240 --> 03:22:44.400
This is a shrunken down version of that guy that got injured.

03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:46.880
Not at this stage, but it's the same cause and all that.

03:22:46.880 --> 03:22:49.760
And when he walks away, you can see it.

03:22:49.760 --> 03:22:52.560
OK, so stare at him.

03:22:52.560 --> 03:22:54.640
We know you use reused assets.

03:22:54.640 --> 03:22:55.560
You be soft.

03:22:55.560 --> 03:22:56.040
We know.

03:23:00.880 --> 03:23:03.560
Sleepless.

03:23:03.560 --> 03:23:07.480
You are scary, but you look very brave.

03:23:08.480 --> 03:23:10.800
Can you bring my mama back?

03:23:10.800 --> 03:23:12.240
Right, now watch him walk away.

03:23:15.560 --> 03:23:17.640
You think you can distract me, video game?

03:23:17.640 --> 03:23:21.040
I'm on to your secrets.

03:23:21.040 --> 03:23:22.920
You might as well have me on the dev team.

03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:24.960
Look at this walk.

03:23:24.960 --> 03:23:26.200
He's injured.

03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:28.000
I can see it.

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:29.560
You can't hide that from me.

03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:31.520
I've played this game far too many times.

03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:35.880
That is the injured thief asset reused.

03:23:35.880 --> 03:23:39.560
You can't get away from me.

03:23:39.560 --> 03:23:42.160
Honestly, I wonder if there is behind the scenes development

03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:43.800
of Brotherhood, because I actually

03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:45.200
haven't consumed any of that.

03:23:45.200 --> 03:23:50.320
And if there is, I know what I'm doing the moment I go to bed.

03:23:50.320 --> 03:23:53.600
Among other things, after looking at Marshmallow.

03:23:56.600 --> 03:23:59.960
OK, we do have two assassin signals, which is really good.

03:23:59.960 --> 03:24:03.840
But I should probably send the recruits away just to get

03:24:03.840 --> 03:24:04.840
stronger.

03:24:04.880 --> 03:24:07.200
But not right now, because we're in the middle of a secret.

03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:09.600
I'm just going to start upgrading stuff as I find them.

03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:15.640
Injured thief number 312.

03:24:20.640 --> 03:24:21.920
OK, camera angle, please.

03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:24.080
Ow, I just bumped into those guards.

03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:26.400
They literally could have reprimanded me for doing that.

03:24:26.400 --> 03:24:27.760
But I guess not.

03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:30.640
Right, we have two assassin signals, which is good.

03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:32.400
Actually, I'm going to send them a fight

03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:38.840
to get some experience, because I need to get them strong.

03:24:38.840 --> 03:24:42.040
So we're just going to watch them do their thing.

03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:46.320
Hopefully they'll hurry up and get some XP.

03:24:46.320 --> 03:24:49.640
Yep, take your time.

03:24:49.640 --> 03:24:52.640
They get XP every time you call them into a battle or send them

03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:53.320
on missions.

03:24:53.320 --> 03:24:54.840
It's not a problem.

03:24:54.840 --> 03:24:56.600
There we go, and the respawn.

03:24:56.600 --> 03:24:57.960
It's all good.

03:24:57.960 --> 03:25:01.000
We will keep another signal to do this mission, though,

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:04.440
because to get 100%, you have to send your signal

03:25:04.440 --> 03:25:05.280
to kill the person.

03:25:05.280 --> 03:25:06.920
Again, another multiplayer character,

03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:08.760
which is why they're so designed.

03:25:08.760 --> 03:25:13.600
Out my way, you moth head.

03:25:13.600 --> 03:25:14.920
I can't really remember.

03:25:14.920 --> 03:25:18.840
He looks behind you on the bridge a lot.

03:25:18.840 --> 03:25:20.280
And I like to write on corners.

03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:21.360
It's quite funny, actually.

03:25:25.320 --> 03:25:27.120
You don't ever use the recruits.

03:25:27.120 --> 03:25:27.760
Are you joking?

03:25:27.760 --> 03:25:29.480
That's the best part about this game.

03:25:29.480 --> 03:25:31.680
If you suck at video gaming, you can literally just

03:25:31.680 --> 03:25:35.200
call in the recruits to do everything for you.

03:25:35.200 --> 03:25:38.920
He should start running in a second.

03:25:38.920 --> 03:25:40.920
No, around the corner, he runs, because we're

03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:41.880
to go over there.

03:25:48.120 --> 03:25:51.080
He's like, yes, there's absolutely no one on this bridge

03:25:51.080 --> 03:25:53.800
that looks threatening to me whatsoever.

03:25:53.800 --> 03:25:57.760
Me just standing, not even hiding in the crowd or anything,

03:25:57.760 --> 03:25:59.880
and stops.

03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:01.440
Oh, see, he's bumping into NPCs.

03:26:01.440 --> 03:26:03.000
That's the biggest thing about tailing.

03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000
If that NPC bumps them, they can turn around

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:06.080
and look you right in the eyes.

03:26:06.080 --> 03:26:09.800
And you're like, oops, you're not really supposed to do that.

03:26:09.800 --> 03:26:11.920
He literally has a knife out.

03:26:11.920 --> 03:26:14.680
And we're going to, I think he looks back here.

03:26:14.680 --> 03:26:17.640
And then, yeah, I remembered.

03:26:17.640 --> 03:26:18.680
He looks back here.

03:26:18.680 --> 03:26:20.920
And then he looks back after he does a sprint

03:26:20.920 --> 03:26:22.920
on top of the stairs.

03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:23.920
You're getting all the strats.

03:26:23.920 --> 03:26:25.840
So he doesn't look back anymore unless he gets

03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:28.720
bumped, which he shouldn't.

03:26:28.720 --> 03:26:29.640
No, he didn't.

03:26:29.640 --> 03:26:30.040
He didn't.

03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:33.000
That's good.

03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.720
And then he's about to break out in a sprint.

03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:38.320
Hey, that's right.

03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:40.360
And then you follow him.

03:26:40.360 --> 03:26:42.620
And then the game wants you to say,

03:26:42.620 --> 03:26:47.360
ooh, I don't think he should have turned around at that point.

03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:48.400
No, he shouldn't have.

03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:49.640
I don't know why he did.

03:26:49.640 --> 03:26:52.160
He's not coded to turn around at that section.

03:26:52.160 --> 03:26:56.040
He's coded to turn around at the top of these stairs

03:26:56.040 --> 03:26:59.880
unless the sequence broke.

03:26:59.880 --> 03:27:01.640
OK, the sequence broke because he's

03:27:01.640 --> 03:27:03.520
supposed to do it at the top of those stairs.

03:27:03.520 --> 03:27:04.200
My goodness.

03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:07.360
I thought we were about to desync there.

03:27:07.360 --> 03:27:08.640
Not a game.

03:27:08.640 --> 03:27:09.640
Not a game.

03:27:09.640 --> 03:27:11.200
You gave me a heart attack.

03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:15.280
We must ensure the kidnappings continue.

03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:18.360
No, there will be no kidnapping.

03:27:18.360 --> 03:27:20.840
He, he, he.

03:27:20.840 --> 03:27:24.240
Requies, got the badge.

03:27:24.240 --> 03:27:27.800
Requies, got the badge.

03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:29.720
And look at his hook arm.

03:27:29.720 --> 03:27:31.440
Yawing, using that for a design.

03:27:35.440 --> 03:27:37.240
I've got two sets of recruits.

03:27:37.240 --> 03:27:40.640
Can they hurt these guys without dying?

03:27:40.640 --> 03:27:45.080
I want them to get XP for fighting.

03:27:45.080 --> 03:27:46.680
Can they do it without Persian?

03:27:46.680 --> 03:27:47.720
I think they can.

03:27:47.720 --> 03:27:49.600
But no one leveled up.

03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:51.680
Not one person leveled up doing that.

03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:53.040
Nah, you're done.

03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:53.680
You're naughty.

03:27:53.680 --> 03:27:54.840
Users supposed to level up.

03:27:58.200 --> 03:27:59.400
Did I get into the multiplayer?

03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:02.920
No, I didn't actually.

03:28:02.920 --> 03:28:04.120
I can't quite remember.

03:28:04.120 --> 03:28:05.880
I think it was like you hid among the, oh, someone

03:28:05.880 --> 03:28:06.640
did level up.

03:28:06.640 --> 03:28:09.400
We'll give her a weapon.

03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:11.240
Look, we've got so many assassins.

03:28:11.240 --> 03:28:15.320
I'm going to send them on missions.

03:28:15.320 --> 03:28:18.360
Sorry if this looks like chaotic mess on the screen right now.

03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:20.600
It's just I've done it so many times.

03:28:20.600 --> 03:28:23.160
You need to look for difficulty level one missions

03:28:23.160 --> 03:28:24.520
and then send the recruit on it.

03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:26.480
And it will automatically make them level two

03:28:26.480 --> 03:28:32.720
so they can at least have a bit more of a fight into them.

03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:35.520
The pigeon's eyes.

03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:40.480
They're a bit, look, the game's from 2010.

03:28:40.480 --> 03:28:43.720
OK, it's an older game.

03:28:43.720 --> 03:28:44.960
I'm not going to steal a horse.

03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:46.040
That's not nice.

03:28:46.080 --> 03:28:48.320
Committing Grand Horse, uh-oh.

03:28:48.320 --> 03:28:50.160
But we'll do this.

03:28:50.160 --> 03:28:51.000
Have you played Unity?

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:51.800
I haven't.

03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:55.320
I played Assassin's Creed, Ezio's storyline.

03:28:55.320 --> 03:28:56.640
And then I played three.

03:28:56.640 --> 03:28:59.120
And I didn't really enjoy it so much.

03:28:59.120 --> 03:29:04.040
And then I played Black Flag.

03:29:04.040 --> 03:29:09.560
But I suck at it because they changed the controls.

03:29:09.560 --> 03:29:11.120
And I'm absolutely awful at it.

03:29:11.120 --> 03:29:12.960
And I've never actually successfully completed it.

03:29:12.960 --> 03:29:15.920
I have no idea where I'm supposed to go.

03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:18.880
I think I'm going to go on to the Tiberina Island.

03:29:22.480 --> 03:29:23.640
I'll just use that bridge there.

03:29:23.640 --> 03:29:24.320
That looks right.

03:29:27.240 --> 03:29:28.000
You enjoyed your night?

03:29:28.000 --> 03:29:29.600
I know Odyssey came out.

03:29:29.600 --> 03:29:30.600
I never played that.

03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:33.160
The newer Assassin's Creed, I'm absolutely not familiar with.

03:29:33.160 --> 03:29:34.560
At all, I do apologize.

03:29:34.560 --> 03:29:37.000
I mean, maybe we can play it for the first time together.

03:29:40.280 --> 03:29:43.440
I think Odyssey got a really good reputation.

03:29:43.440 --> 03:29:45.160
I know there's that Japanese.

03:29:45.160 --> 03:29:46.680
Where the heck am I trying to go?

03:29:46.680 --> 03:29:49.000
Sorry, I'm getting so distracted.

03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:50.720
Talking and playing at the same time.

03:29:50.720 --> 03:29:52.720
I'm sorry.

03:29:52.720 --> 03:29:55.120
Guess who we're about to meet?

03:29:55.120 --> 03:29:56.000
Are you ready?

03:29:58.880 --> 03:30:01.880
Ezio.

03:30:01.880 --> 03:30:03.360
Who are we about to meet?

03:30:04.360 --> 03:30:05.360
Ezio.

03:30:05.360 --> 03:30:06.360
Come here.

03:30:12.360 --> 03:30:13.360
Ta-da!

03:30:13.360 --> 03:30:14.360
Ezio.

03:30:14.360 --> 03:30:15.360
Leonardo.

03:30:15.360 --> 03:30:17.360
Leonardo da Vinci himself.

03:30:17.360 --> 03:30:18.360
Ta-da!

03:30:18.360 --> 03:30:20.360
It is good to see you, friend.

03:30:20.360 --> 03:30:21.360
Come here.

03:30:21.360 --> 03:30:22.360
Pat, pat, pat, pat.

03:30:22.360 --> 03:30:24.360
Hello, Leonardo.

03:30:24.360 --> 03:30:25.360
Long time no see, buddy.

03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:27.360
The Gorge have commandeered my services.

03:30:27.360 --> 03:30:29.360
Actually, they would have killed me,

03:30:29.360 --> 03:30:31.360
had I refused.

03:30:31.360 --> 03:30:33.360
So remember when Cesare said

03:30:33.360 --> 03:30:35.360
the gun was crafted by a friend of mine?

03:30:35.360 --> 03:30:38.360
It was crafted by Leonardo.

03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:40.360
Because he's my friend.

03:30:40.360 --> 03:30:43.360
Oh, congrats if your name's Leonardo.

03:30:43.360 --> 03:30:45.360
You're also...

03:30:48.360 --> 03:30:51.360
He wanted to chop that thing off.

03:30:51.360 --> 03:30:54.360
I don't think any of the modern Aces...

03:30:54.360 --> 03:30:56.360
They don't have charm.

03:30:56.360 --> 03:30:57.360
Yeah.

03:30:57.360 --> 03:30:59.360
That apple.

03:30:59.360 --> 03:31:01.360
Um...

03:31:04.360 --> 03:31:05.360
Don't say that.

03:31:05.360 --> 03:31:07.360
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

03:31:07.360 --> 03:31:09.360
You're making me scared now.

03:31:10.360 --> 03:31:13.360
What's 100% thing for the tank mission?

03:31:14.360 --> 03:31:16.360
Is it hard?

03:31:16.360 --> 03:31:19.360
I thought this game was pretty gamer-friendly.

03:31:23.360 --> 03:31:24.360
You're making me...

03:31:24.360 --> 03:31:26.360
I'm starting to break out in a sweat.

03:31:26.360 --> 03:31:28.360
We ain't even played the tank mission yet.

03:31:29.360 --> 03:31:31.360
Stop!

03:31:31.360 --> 03:31:33.360
Is it bad?

03:31:33.360 --> 03:31:35.360
360 hours for this stream?

03:31:40.360 --> 03:31:41.360
I'm sweating.

03:31:41.360 --> 03:31:43.360
Leonardo, he's drawing, he's doing his thing.

03:31:45.360 --> 03:31:48.360
Did you know Leonardo would eventually like Twilly?

03:31:48.360 --> 03:31:50.360
That's a true fact.

03:31:51.360 --> 03:31:54.360
You're getting educated with me.

03:31:55.360 --> 03:31:56.360
The tank mission?

03:31:56.360 --> 03:31:58.360
Oh, you're making me nervous.

03:32:00.360 --> 03:32:02.360
I'm getting scared.

03:32:04.360 --> 03:32:08.360
Is the tank mission where you have to claim all the towers and stuff?

03:32:10.360 --> 03:32:11.360
I like to get the thing.

03:32:11.360 --> 03:32:13.360
Okay, we have a long double blade.

03:32:13.360 --> 03:32:15.360
We can now do double assassinations, which is one of...

03:32:15.360 --> 03:32:19.360
That was me slapping my leg before anyone claims that it was a fart.

03:32:19.360 --> 03:32:21.360
I already know what I'm doing.

03:32:21.360 --> 03:32:23.360
Fart and Donovan?

03:32:24.360 --> 03:32:26.360
We're just unlocking new weaponry.

03:32:26.360 --> 03:32:29.360
The next thing we're going to unlock is a leap glove, which is fantastic,

03:32:29.360 --> 03:32:35.360
to make jump-climbing much easier.

03:32:38.360 --> 03:32:40.360
I can't remember the tank mission.

03:32:40.360 --> 03:32:42.360
I'm getting fucking nervous.

03:32:42.360 --> 03:32:45.360
I'm making me scared for when we do it.

03:32:45.360 --> 03:32:47.360
I was going to leave the missions all to the end,

03:32:47.360 --> 03:32:48.360
so we're doing story mode,

03:32:48.360 --> 03:32:51.360
and then all the side quests, stuff tomorrow, and then 100% sync.

03:32:54.360 --> 03:32:56.360
Right, I don't know where we're heading next.

03:32:56.360 --> 03:32:57.360
Oh, okay.

03:32:57.360 --> 03:32:59.360
800 meters!

03:32:59.360 --> 03:33:00.360
That's so far away.

03:33:00.360 --> 03:33:02.360
I don't know if we can take an aqueduct.

03:33:06.360 --> 03:33:10.360
We can take an aqueduct to...

03:33:10.360 --> 03:33:12.360
Where the heck are the aqueducts?

03:33:12.360 --> 03:33:13.360
Okay, behind me.

03:33:13.360 --> 03:33:16.360
We can take an aqueduct to the mercenaries,

03:33:16.360 --> 03:33:19.360
and then we'll just have to horse on the rest.

03:33:24.360 --> 03:33:27.360
I'm getting nervous in case I can't 100% it.

03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:30.360
It's literally in the title of tomorrow's stream.

03:33:30.360 --> 03:33:31.360
I'm getting nervous.

03:33:31.360 --> 03:33:32.360
I'm getting shaking.

03:33:32.360 --> 03:33:34.360
Okay, I'm getting a bit funny.

03:33:36.360 --> 03:33:37.360
Where am I trying to?

03:33:37.360 --> 03:33:38.360
I'm trying to teleport.

03:33:38.360 --> 03:33:40.360
Okay, first I need to go inside the guild,

03:33:41.360 --> 03:33:45.360
and then I need to go to the mercenaries

03:33:45.360 --> 03:33:48.360
on the map, and then we're going to do

03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:52.360
the first of the Leonardo missions.

03:33:52.360 --> 03:33:53.360
Where the heck...

03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:54.360
Oh, there.

03:33:54.360 --> 03:33:56.360
I'm literally right here.

03:33:56.360 --> 03:33:57.360
Here, right here.

03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:02.360
Yes, we'll do the Leonardo...

03:34:02.360 --> 03:34:04.360
First Leonardo mission.

03:34:04.360 --> 03:34:06.360
I will do the others at the end,

03:34:06.360 --> 03:34:08.360
because I think it takes far too long to do them,

03:34:08.360 --> 03:34:11.360
in my humble opinion, although I can't remember them.

03:34:11.360 --> 03:34:16.360
The layer of Romulus are pretty good for climbing,

03:34:16.360 --> 03:34:19.360
for those interested in clan.

03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:20.360
Where's my horse?

03:34:20.360 --> 03:34:21.360
I have summoned my horse.

03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:22.360
Come here.

03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:24.360
You're teasing me.

03:34:24.360 --> 03:34:26.360
Okay, right.

03:34:26.360 --> 03:34:29.360
We will very quickly skedaddle over to this area.

03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:33.360
We actually still haven't unlocked the full map yet.

03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:38.360
You don't unlock the full map until sequence 7, I think.

03:34:38.360 --> 03:34:39.360
Act 7.

03:34:40.360 --> 03:34:42.360
So we might hit a boundary wall.

03:34:42.360 --> 03:34:44.360
I'm not sure if I'm going the right way.

03:34:44.360 --> 03:34:47.360
There's multiple ways you can make your way to the location,

03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:50.360
but I think I've done it right.

03:34:50.360 --> 03:34:52.360
Yes, the boundary wall right there.

03:34:52.360 --> 03:34:56.360
So we are doing it right in quotation marks.

03:34:56.360 --> 03:34:58.360
Is it up or down?

03:34:58.360 --> 03:35:01.360
Why are you sitting on the horse like that?

03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:03.360
Explain yourself.

03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:08.360
Okay, we did it.

03:35:08.360 --> 03:35:09.360
We did it.

03:35:09.360 --> 03:35:10.360
We're here.

03:35:10.360 --> 03:35:12.360
I think we just have a really basic mercenary hire,

03:35:12.360 --> 03:35:15.360
and then we will do the first Leonardo mission,

03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:18.360
which I hate because we've actually not got the crossbow bolt,

03:35:18.360 --> 03:35:21.360
which makes it so much easier if you have the fricking crossbow bolt.

03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:22.360
But it's fine.

03:35:22.360 --> 03:35:26.360
Right, the mercenary should spawn in right in front of us.

03:35:26.360 --> 03:35:27.360
Three, two, one.

03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:29.360
Hey, that's right.

03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:31.360
Come with me.

03:35:31.360 --> 03:35:32.360
Come with me.

03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:34.360
You're going to beat these people up for me.

03:35:34.360 --> 03:35:37.360
Thank you.

03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:39.360
And you just tell them to fight like that.

03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:41.360
And that's how you utilize the mercenary recruit.

03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:43.360
Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.

03:35:43.360 --> 03:35:47.360
I have a rogue eyelash again.

03:35:47.360 --> 03:35:50.360
Okay, and then basically you just do all the work.

03:35:50.360 --> 03:35:52.360
I can call my assassins and...

03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:54.360
You know what? I'll do it for the XP.

03:35:54.360 --> 03:35:57.360
Oh, I just unlocked an assassin.

03:35:57.360 --> 03:35:58.360
I'll take it.

03:35:58.360 --> 03:36:00.360
No, I can't do that.

03:36:00.360 --> 03:36:02.360
Uh...

03:36:02.360 --> 03:36:05.360
Oh, okay, done.

03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:08.360
Yippee!

03:36:08.360 --> 03:36:13.360
Okay, we now are going on a mission in a different location.

03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:15.360
Map Retrieve from the Overseer.

03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:20.360
I cannot read that fast, but thank you, Game, for having faith in me that I can read that fast.

03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:24.360
But the truth of the matter is, I can't.

03:36:24.360 --> 03:36:25.360
Don't do that.

03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:27.360
Don't let that happen again.

03:36:27.360 --> 03:36:29.360
Have a little drink of water again.

03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:31.360
My voice is dying.

03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:33.360
I don't know if you can tell how messed up my voice is,

03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:37.360
or if it just kind of sounds like my normal voice at this part.

03:36:37.360 --> 03:36:39.360
All right.

03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:42.360
I'll get with the machine gun.

03:36:42.360 --> 03:36:46.360
So, this 100% is don't kill anyone.

03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:48.360
I have never done that before.

03:36:48.360 --> 03:36:51.360
I always kill people.

03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:53.360
And it's like really...

03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:56.360
It's so much easier if you have the crossbow ball,

03:36:56.360 --> 03:36:58.360
because, like...

03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:04.360
For goodness sake, it...

03:37:04.360 --> 03:37:08.360
Because the crossbow ball doesn't give your location away,

03:37:08.360 --> 03:37:12.360
but the bullets of the gun do, it's pretty bad.

03:37:12.360 --> 03:37:14.360
I'm actually not wanting to move yet.

03:37:14.360 --> 03:37:17.360
That's why, because they turn around.

03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:21.360
I'm gonna yank him.

03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:24.360
I'm actually wanting to go back and kill that guy,

03:37:24.360 --> 03:37:28.360
if I'm being honest.

03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:34.360
Maybe don't have to, question mark.

03:37:34.360 --> 03:37:37.360
There is a rotating guard ahead, which I don't need.

03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:38.360
Oh, he's coming!

03:37:38.360 --> 03:37:39.360
Are you joking me?

03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:41.360
I've just missed him.

03:37:41.360 --> 03:37:42.360
Just missed him.

03:37:42.360 --> 03:37:50.360
We need to shoot him in order to get where we need to go.

03:37:50.360 --> 03:37:53.360
There's two bullets.

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:59.360
Whenever there's a pigeon light, that means you can do a leap of faith.

03:37:59.360 --> 03:38:01.360
Your enthusiasm, the game's cute.

03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:05.360
It's just such a good game.

03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:07.360
So, as long as he doesn't turn around.

03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:10.360
If you run, it'll notify the guard of you.

03:38:10.360 --> 03:38:13.360
So don't run when you do these kind of things.

03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:15.360
Or else the guards just...

03:38:15.360 --> 03:38:18.360
The AIs basically gonna be like, I have found you.

03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:20.360
And then you're like, please don't do that.

03:38:20.360 --> 03:38:22.360
I would like to be uncaught,

03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:25.360
because I don't want to redo this entire sequence all over again.

03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:27.360
Right, so...

03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:29.360
What is he running for?

03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:33.360
Okay, this is a bit of an issue.

03:38:33.360 --> 03:38:36.360
There's a guard that rotates around the century of the wall,

03:38:36.360 --> 03:38:37.360
and that one up there.

03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:39.360
I need to shoot both of them, basically.

03:38:39.360 --> 03:38:41.360
But I need to wait until the other one rotates away.

03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:43.360
Why don't you just hypnotize the guard?

03:38:43.360 --> 03:38:45.360
For real!

03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:47.360
But they can't see me from this distance.

03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:49.360
I'm potent, but I'm not that potent.

03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:51.360
Right, so we can do that, at least.

03:38:51.360 --> 03:38:53.360
And then...

03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:54.360
Maybe...

03:38:54.360 --> 03:38:56.360
Wait, there's a guy there.

03:38:56.360 --> 03:38:58.360
Oh, I don't like that.

03:39:06.360 --> 03:39:07.360
Sorry.

03:39:07.360 --> 03:39:09.360
This part, you can fuck up so easily.

03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:11.360
Okay.

03:39:11.360 --> 03:39:13.360
Okay, we didn't fuck it up.

03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:15.360
Burn it, and then we get this checkpoint.

03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:17.360
Okay.

03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:18.360
Ta-da!

03:39:18.360 --> 03:39:20.360
We have achieved the checkpoint.

03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:22.360
We no longer have to sneak around.

03:39:22.360 --> 03:39:24.360
We can just do our thing.

03:39:24.360 --> 03:39:25.360
Phew!

03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:27.360
I don't ever want to do that again.

03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:30.360
She says as she has to do it again.

03:39:30.360 --> 03:39:32.360
You can just drop down.

03:39:32.360 --> 03:39:34.360
It doesn't cause any damage to you.

03:39:34.360 --> 03:39:39.360
But the music creators for the speed-up song,

03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:43.360
like, that is so terrifying.

03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:45.360
It strikes blood into the hearts.

03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:48.360
It strikes fear into the hearts, not blood into the hearts.

03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:50.360
I mean, that's what hearts do.

03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:53.360
They pump blood around and stuff.

03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:56.360
Get all oxygenated again.

03:39:56.360 --> 03:39:59.360
Okay, this is the part I freaking hate,

03:39:59.360 --> 03:40:02.360
because I don't know how to, like, not get it to lock on.

03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:05.360
You can literally go side-to-side and evade,

03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:06.360
and you will still get...

03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:08.360
Why are there people there?

03:40:08.360 --> 03:40:12.360
Like, I'm evading, but I'm probably gonna get hit on, like...

03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:15.360
I don't know how to not get hit.

03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:19.360
I've played this so many times.

03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:21.360
Although I did evade all of those,

03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:25.360
so maybe my swirling is doing much better.

03:40:25.360 --> 03:40:27.360
Evasive maneuvers!

03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:29.360
Evasive maneuvers!

03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:31.360
Ah! See? I don't get it.

03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:32.360
I'm literally going side-to-side.

03:40:32.360 --> 03:40:35.360
I wonder if it's a distance thing as well.

03:40:35.360 --> 03:40:37.360
Like, if I get too close, the game's like,

03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:39.360
you're not allowed to get that close,

03:40:39.360 --> 03:40:42.360
and, well, sorry, you didn't really explain.

03:40:42.360 --> 03:40:45.360
Like, pardon my French,

03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:50.360
but je ne sais quoi, on what's going on, mate.

03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:53.360
Okay, there we go. Next sequence.

03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:56.360
This is actually pretty badass.

03:40:56.360 --> 03:41:00.360
I can't seem to have to admit.

03:41:00.360 --> 03:41:02.360
Blech!

03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:08.360
Stabbed and throw SFX. Blech!

03:41:10.360 --> 03:41:12.360
We will use the tactical camera,

03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:15.360
because it's literally, like, if you're down in here,

03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:17.360
it's, like, so close.

03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:20.360
And you can use the map to see who's coming up,

03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:22.360
so I can see there's one on the right,

03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:24.360
and then we're gonna swing back left,

03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:26.360
and then we're gonna swing back right.

03:41:26.360 --> 03:41:29.360
You don't need to worry about the archers at all

03:41:29.360 --> 03:41:32.360
in this part of the mission.

03:41:32.360 --> 03:41:35.360
They don't hurt you. I've never been hurt in...

03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:38.360
But you can see left side again on the red dot map,

03:41:38.360 --> 03:41:40.360
which I'm covering up! Lovely!

03:41:40.360 --> 03:41:44.360
I just realised I'm covering up the entirety of the map,

03:41:44.360 --> 03:41:48.360
so you can't see any of that that I've just been commentating on.

03:41:48.360 --> 03:41:50.360
I do apologise.

03:41:52.360 --> 03:41:54.360
Again, the horses always get up.

03:41:54.360 --> 03:41:57.360
Please don't worry. The horsey-worsies are fine.

03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:01.360
You can pre-fire when the red markers spawn in.

03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:03.360
You can get to it.

03:42:03.360 --> 03:42:06.360
And you can, like, hit them before the markers actually show up.

03:42:06.360 --> 03:42:08.360
God, that's really loud.

03:42:08.360 --> 03:42:11.360
Hopefully that's not too loud for you guys.

03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:14.360
Um, yeah.

03:42:14.360 --> 03:42:16.360
The horses are fine. Please don't worry.

03:42:16.360 --> 03:42:19.360
All horses get back up in the game.

03:42:22.360 --> 03:42:25.360
Ooh, if they aim a bit too close, they're gonna get me.

03:42:28.360 --> 03:42:31.360
Ooh, am I gonna get away with that?

03:42:31.360 --> 03:42:34.360
Shoot them down!

03:42:35.360 --> 03:42:36.360
That wasn't bad either.

03:42:36.360 --> 03:42:39.360
Wait, he got back up on the horse.

03:42:39.360 --> 03:42:41.360
You better stop!

03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:43.360
Stop!

03:42:43.360 --> 03:42:46.360
Boom, boom, boom!

03:42:46.360 --> 03:42:49.360
This is, like, sniper-similar, honestly.

03:42:49.360 --> 03:42:50.360
Oops!

03:42:50.360 --> 03:42:53.360
Oh, no, I'm gonna get shot. I messed up.

03:42:53.360 --> 03:42:55.360
Ah, wait!

03:42:55.360 --> 03:42:57.360
Hello? Rote? Esio?

03:43:01.360 --> 03:43:03.360
Ugh.

03:43:05.360 --> 03:43:07.360
Esio actually wanted to perish there.

03:43:07.360 --> 03:43:09.360
He said, I like feeling pain.

03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:13.360
Sorry, I'm, like, really focusing.

03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:15.360
I don't have the best aim on analogue.

03:43:15.360 --> 03:43:18.360
So, I'll try it.

03:43:18.360 --> 03:43:21.360
But, yeah, this is the first mission.

03:43:21.360 --> 03:43:23.360
It's the easiest out of them all.

03:43:23.360 --> 03:43:25.360
This is still tutorial section stuff,

03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:28.360
because the Leonardo missions are main game.

03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:31.360
So, this is technical tutorial.

03:43:31.360 --> 03:43:34.360
We still go in there.

03:43:37.360 --> 03:43:39.360
I'm trying to remember the axe.

03:43:39.360 --> 03:43:40.360
Maybe axe.

03:43:40.360 --> 03:43:43.360
This is the order.

03:43:48.360 --> 03:43:49.360
Oh, can I hit the barrel?

03:43:49.360 --> 03:43:52.360
Yeah, I can hit the barrel.

03:43:52.360 --> 03:43:54.360
How many are there?

03:43:54.360 --> 03:43:56.360
Okay, we've almost done the sequence,

03:43:56.360 --> 03:43:59.360
and then we're back into the main game.

03:44:00.360 --> 03:44:03.360
I might get another cola, actually.

03:44:06.360 --> 03:44:08.360
My voice is feeling it.

03:44:10.360 --> 03:44:15.360
I don't know how to extend the stamina of my voice.

03:44:15.360 --> 03:44:17.360
I'm not really sure.

03:44:17.360 --> 03:44:19.360
Other than, like, be quiet five heads,

03:44:19.360 --> 03:44:22.360
but, like, I want to stream.

03:44:22.360 --> 03:44:24.360
I want to have a good time.

03:44:24.360 --> 03:44:26.360
I have so much lost time to make up for it.

03:44:26.360 --> 03:44:28.360
Like, you have no idea.

03:44:28.360 --> 03:44:30.360
I saw you spawning.

03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:32.360
I saw that.

03:44:33.360 --> 03:44:35.360
I saw you spawning.

03:44:37.360 --> 03:44:39.360
Hydration and practice.

03:44:39.360 --> 03:44:42.360
I've been using my voice for years now.

03:44:43.360 --> 03:44:45.360
Just speak smaller words.

03:44:45.360 --> 03:44:47.360
Okay.

03:44:47.360 --> 03:44:49.360
I work as a co-center agent.

03:44:49.360 --> 03:44:51.360
Water helps.

03:44:52.360 --> 03:44:54.360
Bang.

03:44:55.360 --> 03:44:57.360
Oh, actually.

03:44:57.360 --> 03:44:59.360
Hopefully none of the girls are in here.

03:44:59.360 --> 03:45:01.360
I want to do a short with them,

03:45:01.360 --> 03:45:05.360
so apparently girls can't make, like, good weapon sounds.

03:45:05.360 --> 03:45:07.360
Like, I'll make the sound of a gun,

03:45:07.360 --> 03:45:09.360
so I'm going to ask all the girls to record

03:45:09.360 --> 03:45:11.360
an audio of them making the sound of a gun,

03:45:11.360 --> 03:45:13.360
and then we're going to put it in a short.

03:45:13.360 --> 03:45:15.360
It's just like a goofy, funny-ha-ha thing.

03:45:15.360 --> 03:45:17.360
It's nothing serious.

03:45:17.360 --> 03:45:20.360
800 yards from the location

03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:22.360
of where I'm supposed to go, are you kidding me?

03:45:24.360 --> 03:45:26.360
So I was going to do a shotgun

03:45:26.360 --> 03:45:28.360
and see if they come up with, like, pistols,

03:45:28.360 --> 03:45:30.360
or maybe an AK.

03:45:30.360 --> 03:45:32.360
Right, we've got quite a few levels up.

03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:34.360
We've got a level three, which is fantastic.

03:45:34.360 --> 03:45:37.360
We're starting to get a bit more serious with the recruits.

03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:40.360
They're starting to get a bit more, like, they can survive.

03:45:40.360 --> 03:45:44.360
I'm actually going to send them on a bigger mission.

03:45:46.360 --> 03:45:49.360
I'm going to take the level three to go level up

03:45:50.360 --> 03:45:52.360
Can I send them on level twos?

03:45:55.360 --> 03:45:57.360
But the level two missions are quite long.

03:46:01.360 --> 03:46:03.360
Wonder who's going to be the best?

03:46:03.360 --> 03:46:10.360
I'm going with the classic shotgun, like the

03:46:10.360 --> 03:46:25.240
this time over. Wow. Okay. I guess I will go back to the the mercenaries to use the aqueduct

03:46:25.240 --> 03:46:32.440

03:46:40.120 --> 03:46:47.220

honestly her cubaic wa is unlike something I've heard before and she says

03:56:42.520 --> 03:56:45.800
she's not very confident in it but I'm like as long as you can form sentences

03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:59.480
like the best I can say is like I can say I would like to say I can say I

03:56:59.480 --> 03:57:12.040
which is I can say I don't think I know any more doing words in French any more

03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:23.400
verbs all the French fries are like oh okay here we go I'm back what did I miss

What a French.

03:58:04.480 --> 03:58:06.480
Yes, yes.

03:58:06.480 --> 03:58:08.480
Not the French ones, yes, yes.

03:58:08.480 --> 03:58:11.480
With fish in the bags.

03:58:11.480 --> 03:58:14.480
Yeah, what did you just make me say?

03:58:14.480 --> 03:58:16.480
I can like kind of half read French.

03:58:16.480 --> 03:58:18.480
I have no idea what I'm saying, but I can kind of read it.

03:58:18.480 --> 03:58:20.480
Like with the letters and stuff.

03:58:23.480 --> 03:58:26.480
The French aren't real, it's a line made up by the English.

03:58:27.480 --> 03:58:30.480
Je suis monté, pardon.

03:58:32.480 --> 03:58:35.480
I think chichons means boobah, chichons.

03:58:37.480 --> 03:58:39.480
Uh, yes.

03:58:39.480 --> 03:58:42.480
We will protect you.

03:58:42.480 --> 03:58:44.480
Hello gentlemen.

03:58:44.480 --> 03:58:46.480
May I please double assassinate you?

03:58:46.480 --> 03:58:48.480
No, double assassinate.

03:58:48.480 --> 03:58:50.480
Oh, don't be detected.

03:58:50.480 --> 03:58:52.480
Don't be detected with the mission.

03:58:52.480 --> 03:58:56.480
And the first thing I do is go up and kill some guys.

03:58:56.480 --> 03:58:58.480
I'm not very smart, am I?

03:58:58.480 --> 03:59:00.480
Oh well.

03:59:00.480 --> 03:59:02.480
Eep.

03:59:02.480 --> 03:59:05.480
A little over say, but hey.

03:59:05.480 --> 03:59:07.480
It's fine.

03:59:07.480 --> 03:59:09.480
Morning.

03:59:10.480 --> 03:59:13.480
Good morning.

03:59:13.480 --> 03:59:16.480
Good evening.

03:59:16.480 --> 03:59:21.480
I really don't want to send my assassins on, like, the Lancers,

03:59:21.480 --> 03:59:25.480
but as long as they kill the right guy first, this should be fine.

03:59:27.480 --> 03:59:31.480
Right, sorry, the senator's currently complaining about his money issues

03:59:31.480 --> 03:59:33.480
and how he hates the Borgia.

03:59:33.480 --> 03:59:35.480
I'm talking right over at him.

03:59:36.480 --> 03:59:38.480
Oops.

03:59:38.480 --> 03:59:42.480
Well, thank goodness they came in then.

03:59:49.480 --> 03:59:51.480
Uh, hello.

03:59:51.480 --> 03:59:52.480
Whoa.

03:59:52.480 --> 03:59:55.480
Yeah, see this, the citizens become assassins.

03:59:55.480 --> 03:59:56.480
They get scared.

03:59:56.480 --> 03:59:58.480
Why do you not do double blade?

03:59:58.480 --> 03:59:59.480
I have a double blade.

03:59:59.480 --> 04:00:03.480
I'm pretty sure there's, like, busted to double blade stuff as well.

04:00:03.480 --> 04:00:05.480
I really appreciate it.

04:00:05.480 --> 04:00:09.480
A few different skills to do.

04:00:09.480 --> 04:00:13.480
We should probably get rid of some of our noray.

04:00:13.480 --> 04:00:15.480
This is where we start now.

04:00:15.480 --> 04:00:16.480
We're doing 100% tomorrow.

04:00:16.480 --> 04:00:20.480
We're just doing campaign mode right now.

04:00:20.480 --> 04:00:23.480
Wouldn't be good time zone be easier.

04:00:23.480 --> 04:00:27.480
Good time zone, everyone.

04:00:27.480 --> 04:00:29.480
That's awful.

04:00:34.480 --> 04:00:38.480
Uh, we may be able to get ignored.

04:00:38.480 --> 04:00:39.480
Yes.

04:00:39.480 --> 04:00:41.480
No.

04:00:41.480 --> 04:00:44.480
I was gonna sneak by them.

04:00:44.480 --> 04:00:48.480
I like how he's continuing to talk whilst being beaten up by a sword.

04:00:50.480 --> 04:00:53.480
Are they not attacking him?

04:00:53.480 --> 04:00:57.480
Assassin recruits, are you so for real right now?

04:00:57.480 --> 04:00:58.480
Can you attack him?

04:00:58.480 --> 04:00:59.480
What's going on?

04:00:59.480 --> 04:01:00.480
Oh my god.

04:01:00.480 --> 04:01:03.480
Oh, they've attracted more guards.

04:01:06.480 --> 04:01:07.480
What?

04:01:07.480 --> 04:01:09.480
And now someone's grabbing the guard?

04:01:09.480 --> 04:01:10.480
Hello?

04:01:10.480 --> 04:01:11.480
Right, no.

04:01:11.480 --> 04:01:12.480
This isn't my problem.

04:01:12.480 --> 04:01:13.480
Sorry.

04:01:15.480 --> 04:01:18.480
I don't know what is going on over there, but...

04:01:20.480 --> 04:01:23.480
I don't think they will attack us.

04:01:23.480 --> 04:01:25.480
They're so far away.

04:01:25.480 --> 04:01:28.480
Okay, so the assassins are dealing with them.

04:01:28.480 --> 04:01:32.480
I think the AI was like, no idea who to target first,

04:01:32.480 --> 04:01:34.480
so it was just going for like everyone.

04:01:37.480 --> 04:01:40.480
As a Spanish speaker, it should not be that bad.

04:01:40.480 --> 04:01:42.480
I can understand quite a lot of Spanish.

04:01:48.480 --> 04:01:50.480
That's the best I got for Spanish.

04:01:50.480 --> 04:01:52.480
Sorry, but man's not got any Spanish.

04:01:53.480 --> 04:01:54.480
Hmm...

04:01:55.480 --> 04:01:57.480
I'm trying to think of a better name.

04:01:59.480 --> 04:02:00.480
Puta Matvee!

04:02:00.480 --> 04:02:01.480
Oh wait, no, I did it wrong.

04:02:01.480 --> 04:02:03.480
Puta Matvee!

04:02:05.480 --> 04:02:07.480
That's my Espanol.

04:02:09.480 --> 04:02:10.480
We're going...

04:02:11.480 --> 04:02:13.480
Guards, guards, guards.

04:02:17.480 --> 04:02:18.480
No, a horse.

04:02:18.480 --> 04:02:19.480
Anything but a horse.

04:02:20.480 --> 04:02:22.480
I'm sorry, but you're getting targeted first.

04:02:22.480 --> 04:02:24.480
I don't want any horse problems.

04:02:26.480 --> 04:02:27.480
Oh, the senator's under attack?

04:02:27.480 --> 04:02:29.480
No, they should be attacking me.

04:02:30.480 --> 04:02:31.480
How much health has he got?

04:02:31.480 --> 04:02:34.480
Oh no, he's still like not even lost a square health.

04:02:34.480 --> 04:02:36.480
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

04:02:36.480 --> 04:02:38.480
Assassins help now.

04:02:39.480 --> 04:02:40.480
Okay, we're good.

04:02:40.480 --> 04:02:41.480
We're good, we're good.

04:02:41.480 --> 04:02:42.480
And someone got promoted.

04:02:44.480 --> 04:02:46.480
Smells like promotion, boys.

04:02:47.480 --> 04:02:48.480
Can I...?

04:02:48.480 --> 04:02:50.480
I don't think I can sneak past these guys, so...

04:02:51.480 --> 04:02:53.480
We're just gonna go for it, we're just gonna send it.

04:02:54.480 --> 04:02:57.480
My assassin recruits just take too long to come back and...

04:02:58.480 --> 04:02:59.480
I'm dumb, so...

04:03:04.480 --> 04:03:05.480
Time to get some sleep.

04:03:05.480 --> 04:03:06.480
Please rest well.

04:03:07.480 --> 04:03:08.480
Sleep well.

04:03:08.480 --> 04:03:09.480
Sweet dreams.

04:03:11.480 --> 04:03:12.480
Do you know other Italian words?

04:03:13.480 --> 04:03:14.480
No.

04:03:14.480 --> 04:03:17.480
Only like Spingy for push, Ayuto for help.

04:03:18.480 --> 04:03:20.480
Katso, to swear.

04:03:21.480 --> 04:03:23.480
It's Emmy at piano.

04:03:26.480 --> 04:03:28.480
Aw, is that me doing piano?

04:03:29.480 --> 04:03:31.480
She tickling them ivories.

04:03:31.480 --> 04:03:33.480
Thank goodness I have ivory skin,

04:03:33.480 --> 04:03:35.480
because my goodness, I'm in for a good time.

04:03:37.480 --> 04:03:39.480
They're attacking me anyway.

04:03:39.480 --> 04:03:41.480
Then his friends take me to him.

04:03:42.480 --> 04:03:43.480
I will bring you all the money you want.

04:03:43.480 --> 04:03:44.480
I've not played this game.

04:03:44.480 --> 04:03:46.480
I've played the game in Dutch once.

04:03:47.480 --> 04:03:49.480
Just so to say, follow me in Dutch.

04:03:49.480 --> 04:03:50.480
You say, volg me.

04:03:53.480 --> 04:03:55.480
But yeah, not really.

04:03:55.480 --> 04:03:57.480
It was just subtitles and stuff.

04:03:59.480 --> 04:04:01.480
I knew it.

04:04:07.480 --> 04:04:08.480
Why in Dutch?

04:04:08.480 --> 04:04:10.480
I wanted to learn Dutch at one point,

04:04:10.480 --> 04:04:11.480
but I gave up.

04:04:13.480 --> 04:04:15.480
I only know Scots in English.

04:04:18.480 --> 04:04:19.480
Family.

04:04:21.480 --> 04:04:22.480
I will follow you to the banker.

04:04:23.480 --> 04:04:25.480
Yeah, Dutch is one of the easiest languages

04:04:25.480 --> 04:04:27.480
to learn if you're English speaking.

04:04:28.480 --> 04:04:30.480
It only takes apparently 40 hours

04:04:30.480 --> 04:04:34.480
to get the basics in all that jazz.

04:04:35.480 --> 04:04:38.480
20 Florence.

04:04:38.480 --> 04:04:39.480
That was it.

04:04:39.480 --> 04:04:40.480
In that chest.

04:04:42.480 --> 04:04:44.480
It is a very goofy language,

04:04:44.480 --> 04:04:47.480
but it's so easy to speak and learn.

04:04:48.480 --> 04:04:50.480
If you're ever bored and you're like,

04:04:50.480 --> 04:04:51.480
I want to do something,

04:04:52.480 --> 04:04:53.480
just learn some Dutch.

04:04:53.480 --> 04:04:54.480
Learn the animals.

04:04:54.480 --> 04:04:56.480
The animals are quite funny,

04:04:56.480 --> 04:04:59.480
because you can see how literal it is with animals.

04:05:00.480 --> 04:05:02.480
The title is Shield Poddin,

04:05:02.480 --> 04:05:04.480
which literally shielded,

04:05:04.480 --> 04:05:06.480
and then padded.

04:05:06.480 --> 04:05:08.480
Shield Poddin.

04:05:12.480 --> 04:05:15.480
Got to learn German since my sister moved there.

04:05:15.480 --> 04:05:17.480
Hallo, Leute, ha, was, geht?

04:05:17.480 --> 04:05:19.480
To be good, ja.

04:05:19.480 --> 04:05:20.480
Is das Gras road?

04:05:20.480 --> 04:05:22.480
Nein, das Gras is groin.

04:05:23.480 --> 04:05:25.480
There's some German for you.

04:05:26.480 --> 04:05:28.480
Right, if we don't touch the floor,

04:05:28.480 --> 04:05:29.480
we get 100%,

04:05:29.480 --> 04:05:31.480
but it's a bit finicky, honestly.

04:05:31.480 --> 04:05:34.480
So it's not a big deal if we touch the floor.

04:05:36.480 --> 04:05:38.480
Ja, das Gras groin.

04:05:38.480 --> 04:05:39.480
Ja.

04:05:40.480 --> 04:05:42.480
Dein en maht ha.

04:05:42.480 --> 04:05:45.480
Is a lovely lady, ja.

04:05:48.480 --> 04:05:50.480
Sorry, I'm like completely goofing off right now.

04:05:50.480 --> 04:05:52.480
I'm not even explaining the game anymore.

04:05:52.480 --> 04:05:54.480
I'm just having a good time.

04:05:57.480 --> 04:06:00.480
Most English people have difficulty with the ch.

04:06:00.480 --> 04:06:02.480
I assume that's what you wanted me to say.

04:06:02.480 --> 04:06:06.480
Ja, in Scots to say a lock, which is a lake,

04:06:06.480 --> 04:06:08.480
you say a loch.

04:06:08.480 --> 04:06:09.480
Loch.

04:06:09.480 --> 04:06:11.480
So, kinda, ja.

04:06:11.480 --> 04:06:13.480
And then we also roll our r's,

04:06:13.480 --> 04:06:15.480
like it's not girl,

04:06:15.480 --> 04:06:16.480
it's girl,

04:06:16.480 --> 04:06:17.480
girl,

04:06:17.480 --> 04:06:20.480
so Scots kinda naturally have a buff

04:06:20.480 --> 04:06:22.480
for other languages,

04:06:22.480 --> 04:06:24.480
which is pretty handy

04:06:24.480 --> 04:06:26.480
when you're trying to impress someone.

04:06:27.480 --> 04:06:32.480
I think to say all day every day in...

04:06:34.480 --> 04:06:35.480
All day, took one Taiwan,

04:06:35.480 --> 04:06:37.480
all day every day in Vietnamese.

04:06:37.480 --> 04:06:39.480
Nah, I don't think that's right.

04:06:39.480 --> 04:06:40.480
Please perish.

04:06:40.480 --> 04:06:42.480
Give me a clap, Papa.

04:06:42.480 --> 04:06:43.480
What?

04:06:44.480 --> 04:06:46.480
I'm gonna like clap them cheese.

04:06:46.480 --> 04:06:47.480
Sorry.

04:06:50.480 --> 04:06:52.480
Ja, this is just a classic tailing mission.

04:06:52.480 --> 04:06:55.480
You're not to be out of their POV for 25 seconds.

04:06:56.480 --> 04:06:57.480
We are tailing the banker.

04:06:57.480 --> 04:06:59.480
He currently has our juicy, juicy money,

04:06:59.480 --> 04:07:02.480
which we do get back at the end of this mission.

04:07:02.480 --> 04:07:06.480
I thought it's he was about to jump on the floor there,

04:07:06.480 --> 04:07:09.480
and I was about to inhale a big inhale.

04:07:11.480 --> 04:07:14.480
Khef me in clap, Papa.

04:07:14.480 --> 04:07:15.480
Me spank me daddy.

04:07:15.480 --> 04:07:16.480
Oh!

04:07:17.480 --> 04:07:19.480
Khef me in clap, Papa.

04:07:19.480 --> 04:07:20.480
There you go.

04:07:21.480 --> 04:07:24.480
To the one Dutch person listening in right now,

04:07:24.480 --> 04:07:26.480
he's having the time of his life.

04:07:26.480 --> 04:07:29.480
He is absolutely on it.

04:07:29.480 --> 04:07:31.480
He's like, I'll see your belief.

04:07:31.480 --> 04:07:33.480
Oh, no, that's please.

04:07:33.480 --> 04:07:34.480
How do you say thank you?

04:07:34.480 --> 04:07:35.480
How do you say thank you?

04:07:35.480 --> 04:07:36.480
Thank you, Bill.

04:07:36.480 --> 04:07:37.480
He's like, oh, thank you, Bill.

04:07:37.480 --> 04:07:38.480
Strawberry.

04:07:38.480 --> 04:07:39.480
Thank you, Bill.

04:07:39.480 --> 04:07:40.480
And his reactant.

04:07:42.480 --> 04:07:43.480
It's me.

04:07:46.480 --> 04:07:48.480
Like, I know like the other stuff,

04:07:48.480 --> 04:07:50.480
like Iquil is like I won,

04:07:50.480 --> 04:07:51.480
like Iquiline.

04:07:54.480 --> 04:07:57.480
If you are a human, you say Iquiline.

04:07:58.480 --> 04:08:02.480
If you are ainvral, Iquil...

04:08:05.480 --> 04:08:07.480
Is he gonna get me in trouble?

04:08:07.480 --> 04:08:08.480
I don't...

04:08:08.480 --> 04:08:12.480
I think I can like kill this guy from the box.

04:08:12.480 --> 04:08:14.480
What's inside the box?

04:08:14.480 --> 04:08:15.480
Nothing.

04:08:15.480 --> 04:08:16.480
I'm stuck.

04:08:16.480 --> 04:08:17.480
Please get out.

04:08:17.480 --> 04:08:20.480
Okay, that was funny and unique.

04:08:20.480 --> 04:08:22.480
Please don't do that again.

04:08:22.480 --> 04:08:24.480
I always forget how to navigate this part.

04:08:26.480 --> 04:08:27.480
Are you a fish?

04:08:27.480 --> 04:08:29.480
I'm a cuttlefish.

04:08:29.480 --> 04:08:31.480
I'm a little piece of paper.

04:08:31.480 --> 04:08:33.480
Because I do hypnosis.

04:08:34.480 --> 04:08:37.480
But I've yet to actually make a hypnosis.

04:08:37.480 --> 04:08:39.480
Well, I have a hypnosis audio coming out,

04:08:39.480 --> 04:08:42.480
but like an actual free to view one,

04:08:42.480 --> 04:08:43.480
like ASMR stuff.

04:08:43.480 --> 04:08:45.480
Oh, can I need to get on that?

04:08:45.480 --> 04:08:47.480
We got called again,

04:08:47.480 --> 04:08:49.480
but it sounds terrible.

04:08:49.480 --> 04:08:51.480
I'm kind of glad because I literally have so much

04:08:51.480 --> 04:08:52.480
more stuff I need to edit.

04:08:52.480 --> 04:08:56.480
And basically I need to wake up

04:08:56.480 --> 04:08:58.480
and then work before stream,

04:08:58.480 --> 04:09:01.480
because after stream I can't do anything.

04:09:02.480 --> 04:09:03.480
I don't want to kill the...

04:09:06.480 --> 04:09:08.480
Someone's up there.

04:09:13.480 --> 04:09:14.480
I really don't want to kill

04:09:14.480 --> 04:09:16.480
because if you put the bodies on the floor,

04:09:16.480 --> 04:09:20.480
sometimes the bodies desync this...

04:09:21.480 --> 04:09:22.480
Please stop.

04:09:23.480 --> 04:09:25.480
Are you kidding me?

04:09:25.480 --> 04:09:27.480
This thing was don't be detected.

04:09:27.480 --> 04:09:28.480
I messed that up.

04:09:28.480 --> 04:09:29.480
My goodness.

04:09:29.480 --> 04:09:30.480
No, don't fall.

04:09:30.480 --> 04:09:31.480
Okay, it's fine.

04:09:31.480 --> 04:09:32.480
The senator's right there.

04:09:32.480 --> 04:09:34.480
The banker's over there.

04:09:34.480 --> 04:09:35.480
Well, failed anyway.

04:09:35.480 --> 04:09:37.480
It doesn't matter if I touch the floor.

04:09:44.480 --> 04:09:46.480
I know on Twitter on YouTube,

04:09:46.480 --> 04:09:48.480
but I've got three ASMR videos I need to come out

04:09:48.480 --> 04:09:51.480
and be like, thanks for 3,000 subscribers.

04:09:51.480 --> 04:09:52.480
Subscribblers.

04:09:54.480 --> 04:09:56.480
Yeah, basically,

04:09:56.480 --> 04:09:59.480
my stats say that I've been subscribed to

04:09:59.480 --> 04:10:02.480
over 5,000 subscribers.

04:10:02.480 --> 04:10:04.480
But obviously,

04:10:04.480 --> 04:10:06.480
because we've been getting called,

04:10:06.480 --> 04:10:08.480
it keeps going down again.

04:10:08.480 --> 04:10:10.480
And I was like, oh, okay, I guess.

04:10:10.480 --> 04:10:12.480
But, oh no, I can't leave.

04:10:12.480 --> 04:10:13.480
Oh, I don't have to leave.

04:10:13.480 --> 04:10:14.480
How do I get up here?

04:10:18.480 --> 04:10:20.480
How do I get up here again?

04:10:23.480 --> 04:10:25.480
Well, if you're the only streamer on YouTube,

04:10:25.480 --> 04:10:26.480
it would be Twitch streams.

04:10:28.480 --> 04:10:30.480
Not really interested in Twitch,

04:10:30.480 --> 04:10:32.480
because of the arbitrary,

04:10:32.480 --> 04:10:34.480
like, you're fine,

04:10:34.480 --> 04:10:36.480
but you're not fine.

04:10:36.480 --> 04:10:38.480
And, yeah,

04:10:38.480 --> 04:10:40.480
whereas, like, YouTube, at least,

04:10:40.480 --> 04:10:42.480
it's kind of like, there's definitely an open status quo

04:10:42.480 --> 04:10:44.480
with YouTube.

04:10:44.480 --> 04:10:46.480
And that's much easier to, like,

04:10:47.480 --> 04:10:49.480
it's, you know,

04:10:49.480 --> 04:10:50.480
darling,

04:10:50.480 --> 04:10:51.480
hen,

04:10:51.480 --> 04:10:52.480
you're stressing me out.

04:10:52.480 --> 04:10:53.480
Get up.

04:10:53.480 --> 04:10:55.480
Get it up.

04:10:55.480 --> 04:10:56.480
Don't be nervous.

04:10:56.480 --> 04:10:58.480
One in three men, get it up.

04:10:58.480 --> 04:11:00.480
What do you mean I'm putting more pressure on you

04:11:00.480 --> 04:11:02.480
to perform?

04:11:02.480 --> 04:11:04.480
Get it up.

04:11:04.480 --> 04:11:06.480
Maybe that would be a really funny audio.

04:11:08.480 --> 04:11:10.480
Like, I'm absolutely desperate,

04:11:10.480 --> 04:11:12.480
and I'm like, get up, get up, get up.

04:11:12.480 --> 04:11:14.480
But I'm feeling that would be really unner-

04:11:14.480 --> 04:11:16.480
Maybe for a meme audio, I can do that.

04:11:16.480 --> 04:11:18.480
I don't think that would be a really funny audio.

04:11:22.480 --> 04:11:24.480
I get, like, really aggressive,

04:11:24.480 --> 04:11:26.480
like, come on!

04:11:28.480 --> 04:11:30.480
I've never been auto-insub before.

04:11:30.480 --> 04:11:32.480
A lot of people have been.

04:11:32.480 --> 04:11:33.480
Yeah.

04:11:33.480 --> 04:11:34.480
It's okay.

04:11:34.480 --> 04:11:36.480
The culling stops once, like, more content comes up.

04:11:36.480 --> 04:11:38.480
So, once I've finished the stream,

04:11:38.480 --> 04:11:40.480
YouTube is gonna have to admit to itself

04:11:40.480 --> 04:11:42.480
that I have 8,000-

04:11:42.480 --> 04:11:44.480
8,000 hours.

04:11:44.480 --> 04:11:46.480
No, I have 8 hours in Assassin's Creed,

04:11:46.480 --> 04:11:48.480
and, yeah, people were, like,

04:11:48.480 --> 04:11:50.480
actually interacting stuff on stream.

04:11:50.480 --> 04:11:52.480
So, yeah, YouTube.

04:11:52.480 --> 04:11:54.480
Strongly won.

04:11:54.480 --> 04:11:55.480
YouTube zero.

04:11:55.480 --> 04:11:57.480
And the girls have been absolutely fantastic

04:11:57.480 --> 04:11:59.480
about the culling as well.

04:11:59.480 --> 04:12:01.480
Like, they have been...

04:12:01.480 --> 04:12:03.480
I asked them,

04:12:03.480 --> 04:12:05.480
like, I do not expect the girls

04:12:05.480 --> 04:12:07.480
to stream every single day.

04:12:07.480 --> 04:12:09.480
I've told them countless times, the only reason I can do it

04:12:09.480 --> 04:12:11.480
is because I have rotism, your honor.

04:12:12.480 --> 04:12:14.480
But I did ask them, like,

04:12:14.480 --> 04:12:16.480
hey, for the first week,

04:12:16.480 --> 04:12:18.480
you're most likely gonna have the most views,

04:12:18.480 --> 04:12:20.480
like, you'll kind of, like,

04:12:20.480 --> 04:12:22.480
the deba...no, buff from debut.

04:12:25.480 --> 04:12:27.480
And, like, all of them were like,

04:12:27.480 --> 04:12:29.480
yeah, I'll give it my all, like,

04:12:29.480 --> 04:12:31.480
I'll stream as much as I can in the first week,

04:12:31.480 --> 04:12:33.480
and I'm, like, so freaking thankful and grateful,

04:12:33.480 --> 04:12:35.480
and, like, I really think it will, like,

04:12:35.480 --> 04:12:37.480
completely help with the culling

04:12:37.480 --> 04:12:39.480
and all that jazz.

04:12:39.480 --> 04:12:42.480
So this mission is bizarre.

04:12:42.480 --> 04:12:44.480
You basically have to guess

04:12:44.480 --> 04:12:46.480
the path of where you need to go,

04:12:46.480 --> 04:12:48.480
and, of course, I haven't unlocked the map,

04:12:48.480 --> 04:12:50.480
so I've freaking done it wrong already.

04:12:50.480 --> 04:12:52.480
Is it this way?

04:12:52.480 --> 04:12:54.480
But you're also timed as well.

04:12:54.480 --> 04:12:56.480
Um...

04:12:56.480 --> 04:12:58.480
Aw, and I don't think I can remember off the top of my head.

04:12:58.480 --> 04:13:00.480
I think I have to go up the stairs.

04:13:03.480 --> 04:13:06.480
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...

04:13:06.480 --> 04:13:08.480
No, right, I'm going the wrong way.

04:13:09.480 --> 04:13:11.480
Yeah, so they get, like, suspicious of you

04:13:11.480 --> 04:13:13.480
if you go the wrong way, and it's, like, um...

04:13:13.480 --> 04:13:15.480
I'm sorry.

04:13:17.480 --> 04:13:19.480
Oh, I know, like, the general idea,

04:13:19.480 --> 04:13:21.480
but I don't know the right way, 100%.

04:13:21.480 --> 04:13:25.480
I don't even remember going past these portons, honestly.

04:13:27.480 --> 04:13:30.480
Um, I think we go right of the church.

04:13:32.480 --> 04:13:35.480
And there's, like, upstairs, right of the church.

04:13:35.480 --> 04:13:37.480
My brain is telling me.

04:13:38.480 --> 04:13:40.480
Goodness.

04:13:41.480 --> 04:13:43.480
Yes, and then take a left under here,

04:13:43.480 --> 04:13:45.480
and then the bridge that's up ahead.

04:13:45.480 --> 04:13:47.480
Okay, I think we've already nailed it.

04:13:47.480 --> 04:13:49.480
That is literally how much I've played this game.

04:13:49.480 --> 04:13:51.480
Um...

04:13:51.480 --> 04:13:53.480
The noise keeps putting me off,

04:13:53.480 --> 04:13:55.480
but, like, I know where I'm going, okay?

04:13:55.480 --> 04:13:57.480
Jeez.

04:13:57.480 --> 04:13:59.480
Literally, this is the correct way,

04:13:59.480 --> 04:14:01.480
in the games, like, I was suspicious.

04:14:01.480 --> 04:14:03.480
No, this is the correct way, and I know it is.

04:14:03.480 --> 04:14:05.480
I've played it enough to know this is the right way.

04:14:05.480 --> 04:14:07.480
This is the way.

04:14:07.480 --> 04:14:09.480
Anyone watch Mandalorian?

04:14:09.480 --> 04:14:11.480
Grogu's adorable.

04:14:11.480 --> 04:14:13.480
Grogu. See? There we go.

04:14:13.480 --> 04:14:15.480
We did it.

04:14:15.480 --> 04:14:17.480
Uh, yeah.

04:14:17.480 --> 04:14:19.480
That's all we have to do.

04:14:19.480 --> 04:14:21.480
And we have completed this section.

04:14:21.480 --> 04:14:23.480
None...

04:14:23.480 --> 04:14:25.480
More than an angry squirt.

04:14:25.480 --> 04:14:27.480
Oh, yeah.

04:14:27.480 --> 04:14:29.480
PayPal...

04:14:31.480 --> 04:14:33.480
I don't know what's going on with the PayPal

04:14:33.480 --> 04:14:35.480
and the business, because we literally submitted...

04:14:35.480 --> 04:14:37.480
It has been established

04:14:37.480 --> 04:14:39.480
for months.

04:14:39.480 --> 04:14:41.480
Like, all the stuff we've established for months.

04:14:41.480 --> 04:14:43.480
I think, unironically,

04:14:43.480 --> 04:14:45.480
you guys were supporting, like, AC

04:14:45.480 --> 04:14:47.480
and me so much

04:14:47.480 --> 04:14:49.480
that PayPal's like,

04:14:49.480 --> 04:14:51.480
this is suspicious!

04:14:51.480 --> 04:14:53.480
And then the PayPal's now blocked.

04:14:53.480 --> 04:14:55.480
So thank you for all the support you've shown

04:14:55.480 --> 04:14:57.480
the girls already.

04:14:57.480 --> 04:14:59.480
You literally got the account

04:14:59.480 --> 04:15:01.480
suspended.

04:15:01.480 --> 04:15:03.480
You've literally, like, so much support.

04:15:03.480 --> 04:15:05.480
You've suspended being

04:15:05.480 --> 04:15:07.480
able to support the girls' monetary.

04:15:07.480 --> 04:15:09.480
Like...

04:15:09.480 --> 04:15:11.480
Which is hilarious if you think about it.

04:15:11.480 --> 04:15:13.480
Um, okay. We're just

04:15:13.480 --> 04:15:15.480
tailing the guards.

04:15:15.480 --> 04:15:17.480
This is the court's on mission I was talking about,

04:15:17.480 --> 04:15:19.480
which is necessary to have them.

04:15:19.480 --> 04:15:21.480
Um, if you avoid the guards as much as possible

04:15:21.480 --> 04:15:23.480
to hold on to the group for as long as possible

04:15:23.480 --> 04:15:25.480
because you have two sets

04:15:25.480 --> 04:15:27.480
of girls

04:15:27.480 --> 04:15:29.480
that will go out to distract guards.

04:15:29.480 --> 04:15:31.480
But if you get too close to guards

04:15:31.480 --> 04:15:33.480
and you didn't want to distract,

04:15:33.480 --> 04:15:35.480
they essentially get wasted.

04:15:35.480 --> 04:15:37.480
And it's about me

04:15:37.480 --> 04:15:39.480
literally suffering from success.

04:15:39.480 --> 04:15:41.480
Um...

04:15:41.480 --> 04:15:43.480
I think

04:15:43.480 --> 04:15:45.480
management managed to pay everyone

04:15:45.480 --> 04:15:47.480
for the watch-alongs

04:15:47.480 --> 04:15:49.480
in time before that happened.

04:15:49.480 --> 04:15:51.480
Uh...

04:15:51.480 --> 04:15:53.480
But I hope so, because there is a lot of money.

04:15:53.480 --> 04:15:55.480
I think, like, the total for sponsors...

04:15:55.480 --> 04:15:57.480
No! We lost a group to that.

04:15:57.480 --> 04:15:59.480
To the hay bale.

04:15:59.480 --> 04:16:01.480
Um...

04:16:01.480 --> 04:16:03.480
I think the total of, like,

04:16:03.480 --> 04:16:05.480
sponsorships was, like...

04:16:05.480 --> 04:16:07.480
I don't mind talking about this.

04:16:07.480 --> 04:16:09.480
It was, like, roughly in the 5,000 US

04:16:09.480 --> 04:16:11.480
dollars mark for everyone, like, compiled.

04:16:11.480 --> 04:16:13.480
Um...

04:16:13.480 --> 04:16:15.480
The original budget

04:16:15.480 --> 04:16:17.480
was, like, 20,000.

04:16:17.480 --> 04:16:19.480
But hardly anyone

04:16:19.480 --> 04:16:21.480
was replying

04:16:21.480 --> 04:16:23.480
to the agency.

04:16:23.480 --> 04:16:25.480
So shout out to Umi Plus

04:16:25.480 --> 04:16:27.480
and shout out to

04:16:27.480 --> 04:16:29.480
VNU agency.

04:16:29.480 --> 04:16:31.480
Don't be surprised if you see us

04:16:31.480 --> 04:16:33.480
collaborating with them.

04:16:33.480 --> 04:16:35.480
They were fantastic

04:16:35.480 --> 04:16:37.480
and lovely, and actually

04:16:37.480 --> 04:16:39.480
gave us the time of day.

04:16:39.480 --> 04:16:41.480
Um...

04:16:41.480 --> 04:16:43.480
Yeah.

04:16:45.480 --> 04:16:47.480
So don't be surprised if you see us

04:16:47.480 --> 04:16:49.480
working with those girls, because their agency

04:16:49.480 --> 04:16:51.480
was kind enough to give us the time of day.

04:16:51.480 --> 04:16:53.480
Whereas, pretty much, everyone

04:16:53.480 --> 04:16:55.480
else ignored us, so...

04:16:55.480 --> 04:16:57.480
Yeah.

04:17:01.480 --> 04:17:03.480
Happy it went well, yes.

04:17:03.480 --> 04:17:05.480
The watch-alongs were a complete success.

04:17:05.480 --> 04:17:07.480
Special thank you to everyone

04:17:07.480 --> 04:17:09.480
who did them

04:17:09.480 --> 04:17:11.480
and all of that jazz.

04:17:11.480 --> 04:17:13.480
Uh...

04:17:13.480 --> 04:17:15.480
I'm currently listening to

04:17:15.480 --> 04:17:17.480
flirting in my ear, because I just heard

04:17:17.480 --> 04:17:19.480
you say, Priest of Confession

04:17:19.480 --> 04:17:21.480
or something like that.

04:17:21.480 --> 04:17:23.480
Oh my god.

04:17:23.480 --> 04:17:25.480
What happens

04:17:25.480 --> 04:17:27.480
if we had a nun

04:17:27.480 --> 04:17:29.480
design, okay?

04:17:29.480 --> 04:17:31.480
But then, she had

04:17:31.480 --> 04:17:33.480
a real design under it, but we

04:17:33.480 --> 04:17:35.480
promote her as a genuine, completely

04:17:35.480 --> 04:17:37.480
covered up nun.

04:17:37.480 --> 04:17:39.480
And the promo artwork, her

04:17:39.480 --> 04:17:41.480
voice lines are super conservative

04:17:41.480 --> 04:17:43.480
and everything. And then on debut

04:17:43.480 --> 04:17:45.480
she reveals her real design.

04:17:45.480 --> 04:17:47.480
That'd be so cool.

04:17:47.480 --> 04:17:49.480
I'm allowed to say this stuff out loud,

04:17:49.480 --> 04:17:51.480
but I don't control the design, so

04:17:51.480 --> 04:17:53.480
I'm allowed to say this stuff.

04:17:53.480 --> 04:17:55.480
Um...

04:17:55.480 --> 04:17:57.480
I've got none to do with it.

04:17:57.480 --> 04:17:59.480
I love having no more responsibilities.

04:17:59.480 --> 04:18:01.480
There's not going to be a Fond de la Buse

04:18:01.480 --> 04:18:03.480
because I don't have that responsibility anymore.

04:18:03.480 --> 04:18:05.480
Yay!

04:18:05.480 --> 04:18:07.480
But admit it,

04:18:07.480 --> 04:18:09.480
you love Fond de la Buse.

04:18:09.480 --> 04:18:11.480
I'm allowed to do it.

04:18:25.480 --> 04:18:27.480
Seeing you all to come alive was so fun.

04:18:27.480 --> 04:18:29.480
Did you like seeing the behind the scenes

04:18:29.480 --> 04:18:31.480
of how we all looked?

04:18:31.480 --> 04:18:33.480
I am very

04:18:33.480 --> 04:18:35.480
interested in getting a Celtic design.

04:18:35.480 --> 04:18:37.480
I'm going to say something

04:18:37.480 --> 04:18:39.480
controversial, Karen.

04:18:39.480 --> 04:18:41.480
I actually don't like having

04:18:41.480 --> 04:18:43.480
booba out on Vichubama Do.

04:18:43.480 --> 04:18:45.480
And not my thing.

04:18:45.480 --> 04:18:47.480
And like the cleavage

04:18:47.480 --> 04:18:49.480
and all that. No, not my thing.

04:18:49.480 --> 04:18:51.480
No!

04:18:51.480 --> 04:18:53.480
He got yo-inged by two of the

04:18:53.480 --> 04:18:55.480
freaking girls. Are you so dumb?

04:18:55.480 --> 04:18:57.480
Why would you do that?

04:18:57.480 --> 04:18:59.480
Grrr.

04:18:59.480 --> 04:19:01.480
Vee sucky,

04:19:01.480 --> 04:19:03.480
my fave ages.

04:19:03.480 --> 04:19:05.480
Bruv, it was

04:19:05.480 --> 04:19:07.480
rough.

04:19:07.480 --> 04:19:09.480
Development was rough.

04:19:09.480 --> 04:19:11.480
I'm very happy I never have to develop

04:19:11.480 --> 04:19:13.480
anything ever again.

04:19:13.480 --> 04:19:15.480
Like it's completely off-handed.

04:19:15.480 --> 04:19:17.480
I no longer have to do anything.

04:19:17.480 --> 04:19:19.480
And it's such a good feeling.

04:19:19.480 --> 04:19:21.480
Right, we're just going to hire

04:19:21.480 --> 04:19:23.480
these courtesans to make sure

04:19:23.480 --> 04:19:25.480
all is good.

04:19:25.480 --> 04:19:27.480
But I think we're pretty

04:19:27.480 --> 04:19:29.480
safe.

04:19:29.480 --> 04:19:31.480
Make yourself flat.

04:19:31.480 --> 04:19:33.480
Honestly, I might.

04:19:33.480 --> 04:19:35.480
I might have costume or something.

04:19:35.480 --> 04:19:37.480
Design.

04:19:37.480 --> 04:19:39.480
Alternative outfit, that's how you say it.

04:19:39.480 --> 04:19:41.480
Target is on the move.

04:19:41.480 --> 04:19:43.480
I repeat.

04:19:43.480 --> 04:19:45.480
Tango is on the move.

04:19:45.480 --> 04:19:47.480
Alpha. Bravo. Charlie.

04:19:47.480 --> 04:19:49.480
Delta. Echo. Foxtrot.

04:19:49.480 --> 04:19:51.480
Gamma. Indigo.

04:19:51.480 --> 04:19:53.480
I don't know if that's alphabet.

04:19:53.480 --> 04:19:55.480
Right, right, right.

04:19:55.480 --> 04:19:57.480
Girls, girls, put your arm down.

04:19:57.480 --> 04:19:59.480
Put your arm down.

04:19:59.480 --> 04:20:01.480
Into the hei bail we go.

04:20:01.480 --> 04:20:03.480
The hei bail of shame.

04:20:03.480 --> 04:20:05.480
A big plus for you.

04:20:05.480 --> 04:20:07.480
Behind the scenes and the info.

04:20:13.480 --> 04:20:15.480
Yeah, like, I really

04:20:15.480 --> 04:20:17.480
not really bothered for secrets.

04:20:17.480 --> 04:20:19.480
It's like, how do you do this?

04:20:19.480 --> 04:20:21.480
Put a lot of money behind it.

04:20:21.480 --> 04:20:23.480
Okay, how do you do that?

04:20:23.480 --> 04:20:25.480
Put a lot of money behind it.

04:20:25.480 --> 04:20:27.480
If you ever want to start a VTuber agency,

04:20:27.480 --> 04:20:29.480
I'm going to say this to you.

04:20:29.480 --> 04:20:31.480
Whatever you think it's going to cost.

04:20:31.480 --> 04:20:33.480
Double it.

04:20:33.480 --> 04:20:35.480
I then give it some more.

04:20:35.480 --> 04:20:37.480
Whatever time you think it's going to take.

04:20:37.480 --> 04:20:39.480
Double it.

04:20:39.480 --> 04:20:41.480
And give it some more.

04:20:41.480 --> 04:20:43.480
I had a lot of

04:20:43.480 --> 04:20:45.480
issues with

04:20:45.480 --> 04:20:47.480
like,

04:20:47.480 --> 04:20:49.480
artists going

04:20:49.480 --> 04:20:51.480
past deadlines.

04:20:51.480 --> 04:20:53.480
So everything

04:20:53.480 --> 04:20:55.480
slid back into me

04:20:55.480 --> 04:20:57.480
and it was horrific for me.

04:20:57.480 --> 04:20:59.480
Which is why

04:20:59.480 --> 04:21:01.480
I don't have a lot of things done.

04:21:01.480 --> 04:21:03.480
My ASMR audios are recorded,

04:21:03.480 --> 04:21:05.480
but they aren't edited for you

04:21:05.480 --> 04:21:07.480
that go on YouTube.

04:21:07.480 --> 04:21:09.480
And it's a shame because I wanted to have that all done.

04:21:09.480 --> 04:21:11.480
But, you know, things happened and stuff happens.

04:21:11.480 --> 04:21:13.480
But everything's been fantastic.

04:21:13.480 --> 04:21:15.480
The reception the girls

04:21:15.480 --> 04:21:17.480
received, I'm just so glad people are

04:21:17.480 --> 04:21:19.480
loving on them and just so happy

04:21:19.480 --> 04:21:21.480
with them.

04:21:21.480 --> 04:21:23.480
Like,

04:21:23.480 --> 04:21:25.480
it was not easy

04:21:25.480 --> 04:21:27.480
because I'm freaking sitting on a wall.

04:21:27.480 --> 04:21:29.480
It was not easy

04:21:29.480 --> 04:21:31.480
to

04:21:31.480 --> 04:21:33.480
assign people

04:21:33.480 --> 04:21:35.480
a pre-made model.

04:21:35.480 --> 04:21:37.480
I saw some people ask,

04:21:37.480 --> 04:21:39.480
why don't they just create the models themselves

04:21:39.480 --> 04:21:41.480
that they like?

04:21:41.480 --> 04:21:43.480
I understand that I don't

04:21:43.480 --> 04:21:45.480
do that. You have no idea

04:21:45.480 --> 04:21:47.480
how freaking hard it is to coordinate

04:21:47.480 --> 04:21:49.480
X amount of

04:21:49.480 --> 04:21:51.480
modelers to come together, to come make a concept,

04:21:51.480 --> 04:21:53.480
come to this, come to that.

04:21:53.480 --> 04:21:55.480
I am not doing that approach.

04:21:55.480 --> 04:21:57.480
Please do not think the viewer is going to end up doing that approach.

04:21:57.480 --> 04:21:59.480
However, the girls are more than

04:21:59.480 --> 04:22:01.480
welcome to... Hello? Hello?

04:22:01.480 --> 04:22:03.480
No, we missed a...

04:22:03.480 --> 04:22:05.480
We missed the opportunity

04:22:05.480 --> 04:22:07.480
to assassinate them.

04:22:07.480 --> 04:22:09.480
Bruh. Come back here right now.

04:22:09.480 --> 04:22:11.480
My goodness. Come back here.

04:22:11.480 --> 04:22:13.480
Oh, right. Well, just do it later.

04:22:13.480 --> 04:22:15.480
Pfft.

04:22:15.480 --> 04:22:17.480
Are you supposed to walk right in front of us?

04:22:17.480 --> 04:22:19.480
I think the court is on its path and maybe

04:22:19.480 --> 04:22:21.480
messed them up. Bruh, get right back here.

04:22:21.480 --> 04:22:23.480
But yeah, I am more than happy for the girls

04:22:23.480 --> 04:22:25.480
to tell me what they want for alternative

04:22:25.480 --> 04:22:27.480
outfits and stuff. That's not a problem

04:22:27.480 --> 04:22:29.480
at all.

04:22:29.480 --> 04:22:31.480
But

04:22:31.480 --> 04:22:33.480
to do a debut

04:22:33.480 --> 04:22:35.480
that has input from the start

04:22:35.480 --> 04:22:37.480
that's

04:22:37.480 --> 04:22:39.480
being signed on in

04:22:39.480 --> 04:22:41.480
development is like six months

04:22:41.480 --> 04:22:43.480
in the making. No one wants to be

04:22:43.480 --> 04:22:45.480
hanging about six months

04:22:45.480 --> 04:22:47.480
waiting for their new job

04:22:47.480 --> 04:22:49.480
to start. Yeno?

04:22:49.480 --> 04:22:51.480
Oh, Mero. Hi, Mero.

04:22:51.480 --> 04:22:53.480
How are you doing?

04:22:53.480 --> 04:22:55.480
He has a gun.

04:22:55.480 --> 04:22:57.480
Emi's gone live.

04:22:57.480 --> 04:22:59.480
Okay. Emi... Oh!

04:22:59.480 --> 04:23:01.480
Oops, I wasn't paying attention. Hold on.

04:23:01.480 --> 04:23:03.480
I'm getting walloped by a frickin' lance.

04:23:03.480 --> 04:23:05.480
Oh, no! The hay bale!

04:23:05.480 --> 04:23:07.480
Oh!

04:23:07.480 --> 04:23:09.480
My ankles!

04:23:09.480 --> 04:23:11.480
The hay bale!

04:23:11.480 --> 04:23:13.480
I missed... Oh, that's more guards!

04:23:13.480 --> 04:23:15.480
I'm... I'm hiding in the corner.

04:23:15.480 --> 04:23:17.480
There's so many guards around me.

04:23:17.480 --> 04:23:19.480
I can carry it!

04:23:23.480 --> 04:23:25.480
Oh, my God!

04:23:25.480 --> 04:23:27.480
How did they all follow me here?

04:23:27.480 --> 04:23:29.480
All right, I'm calling in the assassins.

04:23:29.480 --> 04:23:31.480
You're stuck.

04:23:31.480 --> 04:23:33.480
Oh, my God!

04:23:33.480 --> 04:23:35.480
There is so many!

04:23:39.480 --> 04:23:41.480
It ripped the ankles.

04:23:41.480 --> 04:23:43.480
I know.

04:23:44.480 --> 04:23:46.480
Oh.

04:23:46.480 --> 04:23:48.480
Funny you come in here, Mero.

04:23:48.480 --> 04:23:50.480
I was just talking about your agency.

04:23:52.480 --> 04:23:54.480
I was seeing how Yumi Plus

04:23:54.480 --> 04:23:56.480
is one of the very few

04:23:56.480 --> 04:23:58.480
agencies that responded

04:23:58.480 --> 04:24:00.480
to the watch-along offers

04:24:00.480 --> 04:24:02.480
that VLR made.

04:24:02.480 --> 04:24:05.480
Suspicious shout-out to Yumi Plus.

04:24:05.480 --> 04:24:08.480
We love Yumi Plus out here.

04:24:10.480 --> 04:24:12.480
They found us in two seconds.

04:24:12.480 --> 04:24:14.480
I was like pinned against that wall.

04:24:14.480 --> 04:24:17.480
Like, please don't find me, please don't find me, please don't find me.

04:24:17.480 --> 04:24:19.480
Oh, what? Yeah.

04:24:19.480 --> 04:24:21.480
Hardly.

04:24:21.480 --> 04:24:24.480
We were talking about the watch-along sponsors for VLR's debut.

04:24:24.480 --> 04:24:27.480
And your agency and VNU

04:24:27.480 --> 04:24:29.480
were the only two agencies

04:24:29.480 --> 04:24:31.480
that were kind enough to respond to us.

04:24:31.480 --> 04:24:33.480
Where are Claudia and Maria?

04:24:33.480 --> 04:24:35.480
We can talk with the money.

04:24:35.480 --> 04:24:37.480
They followed us all.

04:24:37.480 --> 04:24:39.480
Sorry, I was trying to go to Amy's room.

04:24:39.480 --> 04:24:41.480
I have good news for you.

04:24:41.480 --> 04:24:43.480
I want you to go to Amy's stream.

04:24:44.480 --> 04:24:47.480
If any mods, you get one

04:24:47.480 --> 04:24:49.480
speaking permission.

04:24:49.480 --> 04:24:51.480
Amy's stream link.

04:24:51.480 --> 04:24:53.480
That's your only time you're allowed to talk.

04:24:55.480 --> 04:24:57.480
Whoa, what's going on with the code in there?

04:24:57.480 --> 04:24:59.480
I don't know, I've seen that before.

04:24:59.480 --> 04:25:01.480
All those numbers.

04:25:03.480 --> 04:25:04.480
No more talking mods.

04:25:04.480 --> 04:25:05.480
Silence!

04:25:05.480 --> 04:25:06.480
Silence.

04:25:06.480 --> 04:25:07.480
Thank you.

04:25:07.480 --> 04:25:09.480
But yes, please enjoy

04:25:09.480 --> 04:25:11.480
watching Amy Bizzou.

04:25:11.480 --> 04:25:13.480
I recommend you watch any of my gen mates

04:25:13.480 --> 04:25:15.480
when they go live because I myself

04:25:15.480 --> 04:25:18.480
am an endurance streamer.

04:25:18.480 --> 04:25:21.480
And I will be here for many, many an hour.

04:25:21.480 --> 04:25:23.480
I will be trying to finish the

04:25:23.480 --> 04:25:25.480
campaign mode of this game.

04:25:25.480 --> 04:25:27.480
So please, do not feel any type of way

04:25:27.480 --> 04:25:30.480
if you go to watch any of my gen mates.

04:25:30.480 --> 04:25:32.480
I absolutely appreciate it and love it.

04:25:32.480 --> 04:25:33.480
Please always consider

04:25:33.480 --> 04:25:35.480
liking and scrub-scribing

04:25:35.480 --> 04:25:37.480
to their channels.

04:25:37.480 --> 04:25:39.480
I would love to see them

04:25:39.480 --> 04:25:41.480
get ahead of me sub-wise

04:25:41.480 --> 04:25:43.480
because the girls

04:25:43.480 --> 04:25:45.480
are fantastic and they have

04:25:45.480 --> 04:25:47.480
so much potential

04:25:47.480 --> 04:25:49.480
that I see in them

04:25:49.480 --> 04:25:51.480
and I just want them to...

04:25:51.480 --> 04:25:53.480
I did not want to take your horse.

04:25:53.480 --> 04:25:55.480
Please get back on your horse

04:25:55.480 --> 04:25:57.480
and leave me alone. I apologize.

04:25:59.480 --> 04:26:01.480
We're still short of the crossbow.

04:26:03.480 --> 04:26:05.480
Maybe we can make enough money

04:26:05.480 --> 04:26:07.480
if we send the recruits.

04:26:07.480 --> 04:26:09.480
We kind of need the crossbow

04:26:09.480 --> 04:26:11.480
for this mission that's coming up.

04:26:11.480 --> 04:26:13.480
If you do not have the crossbow,

04:26:13.480 --> 04:26:15.480
it is a heck on earth.

04:26:15.480 --> 04:26:17.480
It's not a fun thing.

04:26:17.480 --> 04:26:19.480
Mercy's laugh is so good.

04:26:19.480 --> 04:26:21.480
You're running the content. You didn't say content too.

04:26:21.480 --> 04:26:23.480
Yeah, tomorrow we do all the side content.

04:26:23.480 --> 04:26:25.480
Today we do campaign mode

04:26:25.480 --> 04:26:27.480
and like go back to like 100% stuff.

04:26:27.480 --> 04:26:29.480
Yes, see look at that money.

04:26:29.480 --> 04:26:31.480
A thousand florins,

04:26:31.480 --> 04:26:33.480
thousand, thousand...

04:26:33.480 --> 04:26:35.480
Oh, that's also another Scottish slang for you.

04:26:35.480 --> 04:26:37.480
Sometimes you can drop the T-H

04:26:37.480 --> 04:26:39.480
and make it an E.

04:26:39.480 --> 04:26:41.480
So the number 30

04:26:41.480 --> 04:26:43.480
becomes the number 30.

04:26:43.480 --> 04:26:45.480
I don't know if you can even hear the difference

04:26:45.480 --> 04:26:47.480
but yeah, with an F. Very.

04:26:49.480 --> 04:26:51.480
Whoa, we have 15,000?

04:26:51.480 --> 04:26:53.480
That's like so much money.

04:26:53.480 --> 04:26:55.480
I didn't expect that much actually.

04:26:55.480 --> 04:26:57.480
I'm going to send the assassins

04:26:57.480 --> 04:26:59.480
on another contract just to get them

04:26:59.480 --> 04:27:01.480
more XP

04:27:01.480 --> 04:27:03.480
because obviously the higher

04:27:03.480 --> 04:27:05.480
they are, the more

04:27:05.480 --> 04:27:07.480
likely they are

04:27:07.480 --> 04:27:09.480
not to fall in battle.

04:27:09.480 --> 04:27:11.480
I really don't want anyone to fall in battle.

04:27:11.480 --> 04:27:13.480
We should get a level up if they come back soon enough.

04:27:13.480 --> 04:27:15.480
Right. Someone say gambling time?

04:27:15.480 --> 04:27:17.480
Wait, why is Amy doing it on her stream

04:27:17.480 --> 04:27:19.480
for you to say gambling time?

04:27:19.480 --> 04:27:21.480
Is she being a naughty?

04:27:21.480 --> 04:27:23.480
Oh, there's a thief down there.

04:27:23.480 --> 04:27:25.480
Oh, I did gamble

04:27:25.480 --> 04:27:27.480
with all the money. No, we're not gambling

04:27:27.480 --> 04:27:29.480
with the florins. I need it for

04:27:29.480 --> 04:27:31.480
crossbow ball.

04:27:31.480 --> 04:27:33.480
And then we're going to go and travel

04:27:33.480 --> 04:27:35.480
to the barracks.

04:27:37.480 --> 04:27:39.480
Come.

04:27:39.480 --> 04:27:41.480
Crossbow ball.

04:27:41.480 --> 04:27:43.480
Best in slot

04:27:43.480 --> 04:27:45.480
which is BIS.

04:27:45.480 --> 04:27:47.480
Best in slot or biz for short.

04:27:47.480 --> 04:27:49.480
Any biz.

04:27:51.480 --> 04:27:53.480
She's doing ASMR.

04:27:55.480 --> 04:27:57.480
Oh, that's why she DM'd me asking

04:27:57.480 --> 04:27:59.480
for that. Okay.

04:27:59.480 --> 04:28:01.480
Yeah, it makes sense now.

04:28:01.480 --> 04:28:03.480
You may enjoy Amy's ASMR

04:28:03.480 --> 04:28:05.480
for no

04:28:05.480 --> 04:28:07.480
particular

04:28:07.480 --> 04:28:09.480
reason.

04:28:11.480 --> 04:28:13.480
We gamble.

04:28:13.480 --> 04:28:15.480
It's supposed to be ASMR.

04:28:15.480 --> 04:28:17.480
Yeah, I wonder if she

04:28:17.480 --> 04:28:19.480
did that ASMR.

04:28:19.480 --> 04:28:21.480
She DM'd me.

04:28:21.480 --> 04:28:23.480
She's like, am I allowed to do ear licking?

04:28:23.480 --> 04:28:25.480
I'm like, you know what? Just go for it.

04:28:25.480 --> 04:28:27.480
I said, I told her, don't breathe

04:28:27.480 --> 04:28:29.480
while you do the licking.

04:28:33.480 --> 04:28:35.480
What does she mean by this?

04:28:41.480 --> 04:28:43.480
Miam, miam, miam. Hydration check.

04:28:47.480 --> 04:28:49.480
But still no.

04:28:49.480 --> 04:28:51.480
Gamble to impress

04:28:51.480 --> 04:28:53.480
or discuss the course.

04:28:55.480 --> 04:28:57.480
We have them in a retreat.

04:28:57.480 --> 04:28:59.480
They seem to be getting closer.

04:28:59.480 --> 04:29:01.480
What does that mean?

04:29:01.480 --> 04:29:03.480
Ear licking.

04:29:07.480 --> 04:29:09.480
Yeah.

04:29:09.480 --> 04:29:11.480
Don't take any down close.

04:29:11.480 --> 04:29:13.480
Oh, I should have bought smoke bombs.

04:29:15.480 --> 04:29:17.480
This is bizarre.

04:29:17.480 --> 04:29:19.480
They spawned in so many enemies

04:29:19.480 --> 04:29:21.480
for this section.

04:29:21.480 --> 04:29:23.480
I get it's supposed to be that you're overrun

04:29:23.480 --> 04:29:25.480
but, my goodness.

04:29:25.480 --> 04:29:27.480
Hold on.

04:29:31.480 --> 04:29:33.480
You can disengage from fights

04:29:33.480 --> 04:29:35.480
by just running away and jumping.

04:29:35.480 --> 04:29:37.480
For some reason, jumping makes the AI

04:29:37.480 --> 04:29:39.480
cry. The AI will not swing for you

04:29:39.480 --> 04:29:41.480
if you jump.

04:29:45.480 --> 04:29:47.480
The other entrance.

04:29:47.480 --> 04:29:49.480
Wait a minute.

04:29:49.480 --> 04:29:51.480
That can...

04:29:51.480 --> 04:29:53.480
It has a double meaning.

04:29:55.480 --> 04:29:57.480
No, no, refling the other entrance.

04:29:57.480 --> 04:29:59.480
The other one.

04:30:03.480 --> 04:30:05.480
Now we destroy all

04:30:05.480 --> 04:30:07.480
of the baddies.

04:30:11.480 --> 04:30:13.480
I do love going on a kill street

04:30:13.480 --> 04:30:15.480
because it's really satisfying

04:30:15.480 --> 04:30:17.480
that everyone...

04:30:17.480 --> 04:30:19.480
The baddies are running

04:30:19.480 --> 04:30:21.480
signals from the field.

04:30:21.480 --> 04:30:23.480
Oh, bonjour.

04:30:25.480 --> 04:30:27.480
Come closer and say that.

04:30:27.480 --> 04:30:29.480
Soon all of

04:30:29.480 --> 04:30:31.480
Italia will be speaking to you.

04:30:31.480 --> 04:30:33.480
Valic sensibilities.

04:30:39.480 --> 04:30:41.480
It's so nice of them to wait

04:30:41.480 --> 04:30:43.480
one by one to attack you.

04:30:43.480 --> 04:30:45.480
I know they have such good manners, honestly.

04:30:47.480 --> 04:30:49.480
Mommy,

04:30:49.480 --> 04:30:51.480
want to explore that?

04:30:51.480 --> 04:30:53.480
I read the funniest

04:30:53.480 --> 04:30:55.480
thing ever

04:30:55.480 --> 04:30:57.480
and

04:30:57.480 --> 04:30:59.480
if you know, you know.

04:30:59.480 --> 04:31:01.480
It was like,

04:31:01.480 --> 04:31:03.480
what happens if you take my boy cherry

04:31:03.480 --> 04:31:15.480
and it was like,

04:31:15.480 --> 04:31:17.480
I'm playing Brotherhood.

04:31:17.480 --> 04:31:19.480
I'm going to watch the stream later

04:31:19.480 --> 04:31:21.480
until all of you

04:31:21.480 --> 04:31:23.480
have fun watching.

04:31:31.480 --> 04:31:33.480
Look at the speed of this horse.

04:31:33.480 --> 04:31:35.480
These horses

04:31:35.480 --> 04:31:37.480
are so much slower.

04:31:37.480 --> 04:31:39.480
What did you mean by that?

04:31:39.480 --> 04:31:41.480
Development team of Brotherhood

04:31:41.480 --> 04:31:43.480
by making the white horse

04:31:43.480 --> 04:31:45.480
the slowest

04:31:45.480 --> 04:31:47.480
in the black horse the fastest.

04:31:47.480 --> 04:31:49.480
What did you mean by that?

04:31:49.480 --> 04:31:51.480
Do you want to elaborate? No?

04:31:51.480 --> 04:31:53.480
No, okay.

04:31:53.480 --> 04:31:55.480
Something rather odd.

04:31:55.480 --> 04:31:57.480
Rather odd about that.

04:31:57.480 --> 04:31:59.480
But then again, it could just be coincidence.

04:31:59.480 --> 04:32:01.480
But then

04:32:01.480 --> 04:32:03.480
is it coincidence

04:32:03.480 --> 04:32:05.480
if you go up

04:32:05.480 --> 04:32:07.480
to like,

04:32:07.480 --> 04:32:09.480
the tan horse is faster than the brown horse

04:32:09.480 --> 04:32:11.480
is faster than the black ones the fastest?

04:32:11.480 --> 04:32:13.480
Hmm.

04:32:13.480 --> 04:32:15.480
Hmm.

04:32:17.480 --> 04:32:19.480
Should we be offended

04:32:19.480 --> 04:32:21.480
by a game that was made 14 years

04:32:21.480 --> 04:32:23.480
ago?

04:32:33.480 --> 04:32:35.480
Don't let the game journalists

04:32:35.480 --> 04:32:37.480
hear we are now.

04:32:37.480 --> 04:32:39.480
It's candle to be.

04:32:41.480 --> 04:32:43.480
I

04:32:47.480 --> 04:32:49.480
I miss when they can gallop.

04:32:49.480 --> 04:32:51.480
You can still gallop, you have to hold A

04:32:51.480 --> 04:32:53.480
but the problem with galloping is if there's like

04:32:53.480 --> 04:32:55.480
people in the way your horse can fall over.

04:32:59.480 --> 04:33:01.480
Canceled on first game stream.

04:33:01.480 --> 04:33:03.480
Wait, why would I get cancelled

04:33:03.480 --> 04:33:05.480
if I point out what the development did?

04:33:05.480 --> 04:33:07.480
Why am I getting, hold on a minute.

04:33:07.480 --> 04:33:09.480
No, no, no, you can't cancel me.

04:33:09.480 --> 04:33:11.480
You just do not reflect to failure agency.

04:33:13.480 --> 04:33:15.480
I just scream that.

04:33:15.480 --> 04:33:17.480
Right, this is my only gripe.

04:33:17.480 --> 04:33:19.480
This is my only gripe

04:33:19.480 --> 04:33:21.480
with this mission.

04:33:21.480 --> 04:33:23.480
You get left at the gate here

04:33:23.480 --> 04:33:25.480
only, I repeat, you get left

04:33:25.480 --> 04:33:27.480
at the gate here only

04:33:27.480 --> 04:33:29.480
to have to horsey your way

04:33:29.480 --> 04:33:31.480
back to the villa when the last

04:33:31.480 --> 04:33:33.480
mission just got you from

04:33:33.480 --> 04:33:35.480
the barracks

04:33:35.480 --> 04:33:37.480
to there.

04:33:37.480 --> 04:33:39.480
I'm just going back to like what you just did.

04:33:39.480 --> 04:33:41.480
That's my only gripe.

04:33:41.480 --> 04:33:43.480
That's right with that.

04:33:43.480 --> 04:33:45.480
On the end.

04:33:45.480 --> 04:33:47.480
Oh, I should do ASMR

04:33:47.480 --> 04:33:49.480
like just me going

04:33:49.480 --> 04:33:51.480
for like 30 minutes ear to ear.

04:33:51.480 --> 04:33:53.480
What was that noise?

04:33:53.480 --> 04:33:55.480
Is that a door?

04:33:55.480 --> 04:33:57.480
It sounded like, ooh.

04:33:59.480 --> 04:34:01.480
Once inside, your men can overpower

04:34:01.480 --> 04:34:03.480
the camp patrols, correct?

04:34:03.480 --> 04:34:05.480
Yes, but especially if the patrols

04:34:05.480 --> 04:34:07.480
are taken completely by surprise.

04:34:07.480 --> 04:34:09.480
Yes.

04:34:09.480 --> 04:34:11.480
My ankle.

04:34:11.480 --> 04:34:13.480
I'm sitting on it funny. I can't believe it.

04:34:13.480 --> 04:34:15.480
That person grunting?

04:34:15.480 --> 04:34:17.480
Literally, man.

04:34:17.480 --> 04:34:19.480
Cody, you're truly a man.

04:34:19.480 --> 04:34:21.480
I'm going to burp. I'm so sorry.

04:34:23.480 --> 04:34:25.480
Oh, that was a little maybe burp.

04:34:27.480 --> 04:34:29.480
Should have been a frog feature burp.

04:34:29.480 --> 04:34:31.480
It would have been very good.

04:34:31.480 --> 04:34:33.480
Oh, it could have been a hypno frog.

04:34:33.480 --> 04:34:35.480
Honestly.

04:34:35.480 --> 04:34:37.480
Do you ever sit normally?

04:34:37.480 --> 04:34:39.480
No.

04:34:39.480 --> 04:34:41.480
I honestly cannot sit in a normal chair.

04:34:41.480 --> 04:34:43.480
Maybe I should do a foot cam, like a thigh cam stream.

04:34:43.480 --> 04:34:45.480
And it's just me showing you

04:34:45.480 --> 04:34:47.480
how badly I sit like the entire time.

04:34:47.480 --> 04:34:49.480
I thought a foot cam stream during a

04:34:49.480 --> 04:34:51.480
horror game would be funny because you can

04:34:51.480 --> 04:34:53.480
watch me shake my ankles.

04:34:53.480 --> 04:34:55.480
And I also have a thing where I

04:34:55.480 --> 04:34:57.480
press my toes into the ground.

04:34:57.480 --> 04:34:59.480
Like I literally have like little

04:34:59.480 --> 04:35:01.480
indents on my toes

04:35:01.480 --> 04:35:03.480
from where I press them into the ground

04:35:03.480 --> 04:35:05.480
because of the way my toes like

04:35:05.480 --> 04:35:07.480
form over on it.

04:35:07.480 --> 04:35:09.480
I know it's interesting, but

04:35:09.480 --> 04:35:11.480
you know.

04:35:11.480 --> 04:35:13.480
Sometimes you don't pick the rotism.

04:35:13.480 --> 04:35:15.480
And the rotism picks you.

04:35:19.480 --> 04:35:21.480
We've got three so far.

04:35:23.480 --> 04:35:25.480
That would actually be funny.

04:35:25.480 --> 04:35:27.480
Okay, I'm down for it.

04:35:27.480 --> 04:35:29.480
Okay, my guy's already gone.

04:35:29.480 --> 04:35:31.480
How about if I send people on you?

04:35:33.480 --> 04:35:35.480
I don't want to get caught because we can easily

04:35:35.480 --> 04:35:37.480
100% this.

04:35:37.480 --> 04:35:39.480
But the assassin recruits take so long.

04:35:39.480 --> 04:35:41.480
Okay, thankfully they got caught in the

04:35:41.480 --> 04:35:43.480
whoa.

04:35:43.480 --> 04:35:45.480
We're getting action shots, like the horse.

04:35:45.480 --> 04:35:47.480
Okay.

04:35:47.480 --> 04:35:49.480
They're a new recruit.

04:35:49.480 --> 04:35:51.480
Let them get up.

04:35:51.480 --> 04:35:53.480
Is the other assassin going to try and

04:35:53.480 --> 04:35:55.480
help or?

04:35:55.480 --> 04:35:57.480
No.

04:35:57.480 --> 04:35:59.480
Let them get absolutely lanced.

04:35:59.480 --> 04:36:01.480
Right, I'll help them out.

04:36:01.480 --> 04:36:03.480
Oh, she's losing health.

04:36:03.480 --> 04:36:05.480
I don't like that.

04:36:05.480 --> 04:36:07.480
Right, go kill the other guy now.

04:36:07.480 --> 04:36:09.480
No, I got these.

04:36:09.480 --> 04:36:11.480
I got discovered because of that.

04:36:11.480 --> 04:36:13.480
Okay, whoa, we need to help.

04:36:13.480 --> 04:36:15.480
We need to help. They're too strong.

04:36:15.480 --> 04:36:17.480
This guy's too strong.

04:36:17.480 --> 04:36:19.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not the horse.

04:36:19.480 --> 04:36:21.480
Not the horse. Not the horse.

04:36:21.480 --> 04:36:23.480
In the boss. In the boss. Get him in the boss.

04:36:23.480 --> 04:36:25.480
Hit him in the boss. Hit him in the boss.

04:36:25.480 --> 04:36:27.480
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:36:27.480 --> 04:36:29.480
It's fine. I don't know how to go against the horse.

04:36:29.480 --> 04:36:31.480
Please leave me alone.

04:36:31.480 --> 04:36:33.480
I don't know how to deal with horses.

04:36:33.480 --> 04:36:35.480
Okay, there we go.

04:36:35.480 --> 04:36:37.480
Okay, we're dealing with the crossbow ball.

04:36:37.480 --> 04:36:39.480
Jeez.

04:36:39.480 --> 04:36:41.480
Rank 10 assassins are so good,

04:36:41.480 --> 04:36:43.480
honestly.

04:36:43.480 --> 04:36:45.480
We are very slowly

04:36:45.480 --> 04:36:47.480
leveling them up.

04:36:47.480 --> 04:36:49.480
I'm wanting to try and pick a fight.

04:36:49.480 --> 04:36:51.480
Can I pick a fight?

04:36:51.480 --> 04:36:53.480
Ooh, feather.

04:36:53.480 --> 04:36:55.480
Look how daintily I jumped over that.

04:36:55.480 --> 04:36:57.480
That was beautiful.

04:36:57.480 --> 04:36:59.480
Are you okay?

04:36:59.480 --> 04:37:01.480
Have you heard about this? Have you heard about this jump?

04:37:01.480 --> 04:37:03.480
Hey, there we go.

04:37:03.480 --> 04:37:05.480
We're going to upset these guys.

04:37:05.480 --> 04:37:07.480
Wait, that's a barrier?

04:37:09.480 --> 04:37:11.480
That's a barrier.

04:37:11.480 --> 04:37:13.480
Can you jump over them?

04:37:13.480 --> 04:37:15.480
I've never seen that before.

04:37:15.480 --> 04:37:17.480
We're going to upset these guards on purpose.

04:37:17.480 --> 04:37:19.480
So we can... Ouch!

04:37:19.480 --> 04:37:21.480
I didn't expect that.

04:37:21.480 --> 04:37:23.480
Oh, geez!

04:37:23.480 --> 04:37:25.480
Oh, my goodness.

04:37:25.480 --> 04:37:27.480
I just got double whammy right off the bat.

04:37:27.480 --> 04:37:29.480
Oh, my...

04:37:29.480 --> 04:37:31.480
Okay, I need to take the big guy.

04:37:31.480 --> 04:37:33.480
Thank you, big guy,

04:37:33.480 --> 04:37:35.480
for perishing.

04:37:35.480 --> 04:37:37.480
Can't handle you.

04:37:37.480 --> 04:37:39.480
Okay, how about that?

04:37:39.480 --> 04:37:41.480
Yeah, big...

04:37:41.480 --> 04:37:43.480
Oh, we need one more.

04:37:43.480 --> 04:37:45.480
Who's going to perish? You are going to perish.

04:37:47.480 --> 04:37:49.480
See, the horses are getting stuck here.

04:37:51.480 --> 04:37:53.480
I don't know where I'm supposed to go now.

04:37:55.480 --> 04:37:57.480
I predict a riot.

04:37:57.480 --> 04:37:59.480
Ooh, do you not want to go down there?

04:37:59.480 --> 04:38:01.480
Because it's such a nightmare getting out there.

04:38:01.480 --> 04:38:03.480
How many steps is that?

04:38:07.480 --> 04:38:09.480
I don't even think I've done a double kill yet.

04:38:09.480 --> 04:38:11.480
I'm probably going to have to wait till the air stops.

04:38:11.480 --> 04:38:13.480
I'm going to have to go back to the barracks.

04:38:13.480 --> 04:38:15.480
I'm riding a horse and I'm going to go back to the barracks.

04:38:17.480 --> 04:38:19.480
Oh, I'll most likely do

04:38:19.480 --> 04:38:21.480
like a full playthrough of Itu's

04:38:21.480 --> 04:38:23.480
storyline.

04:38:23.480 --> 04:38:25.480
Where am I going?

04:38:25.480 --> 04:38:27.480
Have you seen this?

04:38:31.480 --> 04:38:33.480
Okay, wait, I'm just being deaf.

04:38:33.480 --> 04:38:35.480
Ooh!

04:38:35.480 --> 04:38:37.480
Right, we're going to do this Borgia Tower.

04:38:45.480 --> 04:38:47.480
That's a lot of guards.

04:38:49.480 --> 04:38:51.480
Hmm.

04:38:51.480 --> 04:38:53.480
Are we going to hit by Border Patrol?

04:38:55.480 --> 04:38:57.480
Wait, we're going to get you.

04:39:01.480 --> 04:39:03.480
And then we're going to just

04:39:03.480 --> 04:39:05.480
sneak up here and kill you.

04:39:07.480 --> 04:39:09.480
Okay, I'll take that.

04:39:09.480 --> 04:39:11.480
Do you guys need help?

04:39:11.480 --> 04:39:13.480
I'll give you a second recruitment beam

04:39:15.480 --> 04:39:17.480
and let you guys fight it out

04:39:17.480 --> 04:39:19.480
and I'm going to climb up here

04:39:19.480 --> 04:39:21.480
and do this.

04:39:21.480 --> 04:39:23.480
Do we skip up here?

04:39:23.480 --> 04:39:25.480
I cannot play Assassin's Creed 1.

04:39:25.480 --> 04:39:27.480
I absolutely suck at it.

04:39:27.480 --> 04:39:29.480
I am so sorry.

04:39:29.480 --> 04:39:31.480
I cannot do it.

04:39:31.480 --> 04:39:33.480
I've tried Beyond Belief.

04:39:33.480 --> 04:39:35.480
I ended up watching someone else play it

04:39:35.480 --> 04:39:37.480
just so I know the storyline.

04:39:37.480 --> 04:39:39.480
Beyond Belief, I'm absolutely trash.

04:39:43.480 --> 04:39:45.480
I probably...

04:39:45.480 --> 04:39:47.480
No, I'm doing variety,

04:39:47.480 --> 04:39:49.480
but what I'll probably do running up to October 10

04:39:49.480 --> 04:39:51.480
is

04:39:51.480 --> 04:39:53.480
I'll play

04:39:53.480 --> 04:39:55.480
Assassin's Creed 2

04:39:55.480 --> 04:39:57.480
before it, then October 10

04:39:57.480 --> 04:39:59.480
play Brotherhood again

04:39:59.480 --> 04:40:01.480
and then after play Revelations

04:40:01.480 --> 04:40:03.480
and then we'll get the full Ezio story.

04:40:07.480 --> 04:40:09.480
Sometimes it doesn't engage in combat mode

04:40:09.480 --> 04:40:11.480
and then the enemies get like a free hit on you

04:40:11.480 --> 04:40:13.480
because there's nothing you can do.

04:40:15.480 --> 04:40:17.480
I mean, I know why it does it

04:40:17.480 --> 04:40:19.480
because stuff and things, but...

04:40:23.480 --> 04:40:25.480
We're level 4,

04:40:25.480 --> 04:40:27.480
we're kind of getting a little bit decent.

04:40:27.480 --> 04:40:29.480
It's not the best.

04:40:29.480 --> 04:40:31.480
We're really not that strong.

04:40:31.480 --> 04:40:33.480
I'm just plumping it all into armor

04:40:33.480 --> 04:40:35.480
because I get so nervous for them.

04:40:37.480 --> 04:40:39.480
I don't want to do a level 4.

04:40:39.480 --> 04:40:41.480
Maybe a 3?

04:40:41.480 --> 04:40:43.480
Send 2 on a level 3

04:40:43.480 --> 04:40:45.480
XP, which is like 100 each.

04:40:45.480 --> 04:40:47.480
Yeah...

04:40:47.480 --> 04:40:49.480
Oh, a second one? Okay, we'll do that.

04:40:51.480 --> 04:40:53.480
That's some old saying to get...

04:40:53.480 --> 04:40:55.480
Oh, my tummy rumbled.

04:40:55.480 --> 04:40:57.480
My tummy rumbled.

04:40:57.480 --> 04:40:59.480
Make me to get some...

04:40:59.480 --> 04:41:01.480
Oh, my tummy rumbled again.

04:41:01.480 --> 04:41:03.480
I don't know if that's getting picked up in the make,

04:41:03.480 --> 04:41:05.480
but I think I'm getting a bit peckish

04:41:05.480 --> 04:41:07.480
for actual things.

04:41:07.480 --> 04:41:09.480
You know, sometimes a meat stick doesn't do it.

04:41:09.480 --> 04:41:11.480
Sometimes you need more.

04:41:13.480 --> 04:41:15.480
But...

04:41:15.480 --> 04:41:17.480
There's so many jokes I can make,

04:41:17.480 --> 04:41:19.480
but they're too easy. I'm just going to leave it.

04:41:19.480 --> 04:41:21.480
Actually, I'm going to buy smoke bomb pouch if I can.

04:41:23.480 --> 04:41:25.480
It's 9000 Florence!

04:41:25.480 --> 04:41:27.480
Who has 9000 Florence?

04:41:29.480 --> 04:41:31.480
Unreal.

04:41:31.480 --> 04:41:33.480
Unreal Engine.

04:41:33.480 --> 04:41:35.480
Who has 9000 Florence?

04:41:35.480 --> 04:41:37.480
Not me.

04:41:37.480 --> 04:41:39.480
Yeah, to me, say.

04:41:39.480 --> 04:41:41.480
You know what they say?

04:41:41.480 --> 04:41:43.480
I'm in the pink.

04:41:43.480 --> 04:41:45.480
All in the stink.

04:41:47.480 --> 04:41:49.480
Who has 9000?

04:41:49.480 --> 04:41:51.480
Okay, we're going to get smoke bomb.

04:41:51.480 --> 04:41:53.480
Excuse me, excuse me.

04:41:53.480 --> 04:41:55.480
I want a smoke bomb pouch.

04:41:55.480 --> 04:41:57.480
Smoke bomb pouch?

04:41:57.480 --> 04:41:59.480
Smoke bomb pouch, yes.

04:41:59.480 --> 04:42:01.480
No, not the knife bell.

04:42:01.480 --> 04:42:03.480
Okay, we have smoke bombs almost.

04:42:03.480 --> 04:42:05.480
We, a viewer, are not serving the talents.

04:42:05.480 --> 04:42:07.480
Okay.

04:42:09.480 --> 04:42:11.480
I can't believe...

04:42:11.480 --> 04:42:13.480
I actually don't get enough of a cut

04:42:13.480 --> 04:42:15.480
or a split that I can't even afford to...

04:42:15.480 --> 04:42:17.480
Oh, there's an assassin recruit down here.

04:42:19.480 --> 04:42:21.480
Yes, I will help you.

04:42:21.480 --> 04:42:23.480
No, let me help you.

04:42:23.480 --> 04:42:25.480
Oh, it's a lady. Oh, my lady.

04:42:25.480 --> 04:42:27.480
We actually need to

04:42:27.480 --> 04:42:29.480
smoke bomb.

04:42:29.480 --> 04:42:31.480
Because we need to kill people in a smoke bomb.

04:42:31.480 --> 04:42:33.480
For...

04:42:33.480 --> 04:42:35.480
Why?

04:42:35.480 --> 04:42:37.480
What?

04:42:37.480 --> 04:42:39.480
Why do they just get aggressive on us?

04:42:41.480 --> 04:42:43.480
Sometimes you need a group of meat sticks.

04:42:43.480 --> 04:42:45.480
Ace Marbuth.

04:42:45.480 --> 04:42:47.480
Who said that?

04:42:47.480 --> 04:42:49.480
Who said that?

04:42:49.480 --> 04:42:51.480
Just put them on a warning.

04:42:51.480 --> 04:42:53.480
Whoever insinuates that the Ace Marbuth

04:42:53.480 --> 04:42:55.480
is going to be utilized for anything but tingling.

04:42:55.480 --> 04:42:57.480
Put them on a warning.

04:42:57.480 --> 04:42:59.480
Don't.

04:42:59.480 --> 04:43:01.480
Teasing.

04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:05.480
I'm teasing.

04:43:05.480 --> 04:43:07.480
I actually think I might need to get...

04:43:07.480 --> 04:43:09.480
I like, I never notice that I'm like hungry

04:43:09.480 --> 04:43:11.480
or NTP and then as soon as I notice it,

04:43:11.480 --> 04:43:13.480
I'm like, ah!

04:43:13.480 --> 04:43:15.480
I'm perishing, I'm perishing.

04:43:15.480 --> 04:43:17.480
Mods.

04:43:17.480 --> 04:43:19.480
File this man's tax return.

04:43:19.480 --> 04:43:21.480
Oh, my God, I cannot wait to...

04:43:21.480 --> 04:43:23.480
I have a funny short coming out about

04:43:23.480 --> 04:43:25.480
like what you can get taxed back

04:43:25.480 --> 04:43:27.480
in a beach of our agency.

04:43:27.480 --> 04:43:29.480
You know my Donut-Thon rewards?

04:43:29.480 --> 04:43:31.480
One of them is going to be

04:43:31.480 --> 04:43:33.480
a length chart.

04:43:33.480 --> 04:43:35.480
I get to submit that

04:43:35.480 --> 04:43:37.480
for tax back

04:43:37.480 --> 04:43:39.480
because it's

04:43:39.480 --> 04:43:41.480
what I needed to do

04:43:41.480 --> 04:43:43.480
in order to operate.

04:43:43.480 --> 04:43:45.480
Like, it's crazy what you can get in tax back.

04:43:45.480 --> 04:43:47.480
Like, obviously it doesn't mean I get

04:43:47.480 --> 04:43:49.480
the full price of it back in taxes.

04:43:49.480 --> 04:43:51.480
No, it just means like...

04:43:51.480 --> 04:43:53.480
It's like, okay,

04:43:53.480 --> 04:43:55.480
you can get like two dollars back

04:43:55.480 --> 04:43:57.480
on your tax return.

04:43:57.480 --> 04:43:59.480
I appreciate it.

04:43:59.480 --> 04:44:01.480
But like, yeah, you can get taxed back on models,

04:44:01.480 --> 04:44:03.480
get taxed back on equipment,

04:44:03.480 --> 04:44:05.480
get taxed back on internet,

04:44:05.480 --> 04:44:07.480
get taxed back on...

04:44:07.480 --> 04:44:09.480
rent as well, I get taxed back on.

04:44:09.480 --> 04:44:11.480
Paying your tax

04:44:11.480 --> 04:44:13.480
the stream.

04:44:13.480 --> 04:44:15.480
Oh, I don't even want to think about

04:44:15.480 --> 04:44:17.480
taxes, honestly.

04:44:17.480 --> 04:44:19.480
Although it was pretty...

04:44:19.480 --> 04:44:21.480
pretty...

04:44:21.480 --> 04:44:23.480
Yes, it doesn't mean I'm going to like

04:44:23.480 --> 04:44:25.480
get the full thing back.

04:44:25.480 --> 04:44:27.480
Sorry, sometimes when people talk about tax

04:44:27.480 --> 04:44:29.480
back,

04:44:29.480 --> 04:44:31.480
it sounds like they mean

04:44:31.480 --> 04:44:33.480
you get the full thing back, which is not the case at all.

04:44:35.480 --> 04:44:37.480
Everything is a business, right?

04:44:37.480 --> 04:44:39.480
If you can justify it

04:44:39.480 --> 04:44:41.480
100%

04:44:41.480 --> 04:44:43.480
because I can imagine a vealer

04:44:43.480 --> 04:44:45.480
got audited and I have to go like,

04:44:45.480 --> 04:44:47.480
oh yeah, you know this special artwork

04:44:47.480 --> 04:44:49.480
that was part of the business

04:44:49.480 --> 04:44:51.480
because we're an entertainment business.

04:44:51.480 --> 04:44:53.480
It would be hilarious.

04:44:53.480 --> 04:44:55.480
ASMR girl Iris

04:44:55.480 --> 04:44:57.480
Agent

04:44:57.480 --> 04:44:59.480
interrogates you.

04:44:59.480 --> 04:45:01.480
Wait, what am I doing?

04:45:01.480 --> 04:45:03.480
Oh, right in the balls.

04:45:03.480 --> 04:45:05.480
Wait, why did...

04:45:05.480 --> 04:45:07.480
Oh, did I just

04:45:07.480 --> 04:45:09.480
freak? Oh my god.

04:45:09.480 --> 04:45:11.480
I'm sorry, I really just

04:45:11.480 --> 04:45:13.480
like the last men.

04:45:13.480 --> 04:45:15.480
Small

04:45:15.480 --> 04:45:17.480
poles only, please, my goodness.

04:45:17.480 --> 04:45:19.480
They're so hard to defeat.

04:45:19.480 --> 04:45:21.480
The company

04:45:21.480 --> 04:45:23.480
has an account and does everything legally.

04:45:23.480 --> 04:45:25.480
Okay, dude.

04:45:27.480 --> 04:45:29.480
Management. Actually, there's an account

04:45:29.480 --> 04:45:31.480
and that's true.

04:45:33.480 --> 04:45:35.480
Small poles only, so ogre.

04:45:37.480 --> 04:45:39.480
Wait until he'll tell you about my doctor's visit.

04:45:39.480 --> 04:45:41.480
That's for our later stream.

04:45:43.480 --> 04:45:45.480
You tell it in like raw 4k detail

04:45:45.480 --> 04:45:47.480
about the walkers.

04:45:55.480 --> 04:45:57.480
Right, what am I supposed to do?

04:45:57.480 --> 04:45:59.480
Follow Bartolomeo and his mercenaries.

04:45:59.480 --> 04:46:01.480
Okay, he's about to activate this next

04:46:01.480 --> 04:46:03.480
thing.

04:46:03.480 --> 04:46:05.480
I am now to perish the guards

04:46:05.480 --> 04:46:07.480
of my own deck guild.

04:46:07.480 --> 04:46:09.480
So this guy

04:46:09.480 --> 04:46:11.480
can go first

04:46:11.480 --> 04:46:13.480
and

04:46:13.480 --> 04:46:15.480
then I can do

04:46:15.480 --> 04:46:17.480
you.

04:46:17.480 --> 04:46:19.480
And then, last but not least,

04:46:19.480 --> 04:46:21.480
I can do you.

04:46:21.480 --> 04:46:23.480
No.

04:46:23.480 --> 04:46:25.480
Don't be silly,

04:46:25.480 --> 04:46:27.480
it's your

04:46:27.480 --> 04:46:29.480
aim on the guard, my goodness.

04:46:29.480 --> 04:46:31.480
By the way, this came

04:46:31.480 --> 04:46:33.480
deaf. What?

04:46:33.480 --> 04:46:35.480
Hello?

04:46:37.480 --> 04:46:39.480
Hello?

04:46:39.480 --> 04:46:41.480
I got desynchronized, but I did

04:46:41.480 --> 04:46:43.480
what you asked.

04:46:43.480 --> 04:46:45.480
I did everything right

04:46:45.480 --> 04:46:47.480
and I still lost.

04:46:47.480 --> 04:46:49.480
Wait.

04:46:49.480 --> 04:46:51.480
This isn't the original checkpoint.

04:46:51.480 --> 04:46:53.480
We still, wait, we hit the checkpoint

04:46:53.480 --> 04:46:55.480
and it let us go through.

04:46:59.480 --> 04:47:01.480
Okay, okay, I'll take it.

04:47:05.480 --> 04:47:07.480
Okay, next

04:47:07.480 --> 04:47:09.480
guard checkpoint.

04:47:09.480 --> 04:47:11.480
One to our left.

04:47:11.480 --> 04:47:13.480
I might go kill him the new.

04:47:13.480 --> 04:47:15.480
Good day to you.

04:47:15.480 --> 04:47:17.480
Please stop walking.

04:47:17.480 --> 04:47:19.480
Thank you.

04:47:19.480 --> 04:47:21.480
Okay, there's a second guard

04:47:21.480 --> 04:47:23.480
there.

04:47:23.480 --> 04:47:25.480
I really want to get

04:47:27.480 --> 04:47:29.480
I need them to

04:47:29.480 --> 04:47:31.480
split up.

04:47:31.480 --> 04:47:33.480
Focus, focus, there's a pizza on your

04:47:33.480 --> 04:47:35.480
focus.

04:47:35.480 --> 04:47:37.480
I

04:47:37.480 --> 04:47:39.480
was too

04:47:39.480 --> 04:47:41.480
in range. If I can time this right,

04:47:41.480 --> 04:47:43.480
I'm not going to desync.

04:47:43.480 --> 04:47:45.480
I did it.

04:47:45.480 --> 04:47:47.480
Did you see that though? The AI

04:47:47.480 --> 04:47:49.480
looked at me. Oh my goodness, right?

04:47:49.480 --> 04:47:51.480
What way are you going Bartolomeo?

04:47:51.480 --> 04:47:53.480
You're going this way.

04:47:53.480 --> 04:47:55.480
That was the way.

04:47:59.480 --> 04:48:01.480
I'm French.

04:48:01.480 --> 04:48:03.480
I'm French.

04:48:03.480 --> 04:48:05.480
I'm French.

04:48:05.480 --> 04:48:07.480
I'm French.

04:48:07.480 --> 04:48:09.480
I'm French.

04:48:09.480 --> 04:48:11.480
I'm French.

04:48:11.480 --> 04:48:13.480
I'm not Italian or an assassin.

04:48:17.480 --> 04:48:19.480
I don't know how.

04:48:19.480 --> 04:48:21.480
We didn't get desync to do in that

04:48:21.480 --> 04:48:23.480
but we made it.

04:48:23.480 --> 04:48:25.480
Right, we've got a guard on the

04:48:25.480 --> 04:48:27.480
outside here.

04:48:27.480 --> 04:48:29.480
I actually don't remember this part a lot.

04:48:29.480 --> 04:48:31.480
You,

04:48:31.480 --> 04:48:33.480
I've got two guards next to each other.

04:48:33.480 --> 04:48:35.480
I don't like

04:48:35.480 --> 04:48:37.480
Oh, he's coming this way.

04:48:37.480 --> 04:48:39.480
Oh, there's a dead body.

04:48:43.480 --> 04:48:45.480
It's fine.

04:48:45.480 --> 04:48:47.480
Oh no, he's gone for the dead body.

04:48:47.480 --> 04:48:49.480
I didn't think that through.

04:48:49.480 --> 04:48:51.480
That was very lucky that we didn't desync all there.

04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:53.480
Phew, we did it.

04:48:53.480 --> 04:48:55.480
The hard part is over.

04:48:55.480 --> 04:48:57.480
Now it's for the easy part.

04:48:57.480 --> 04:48:59.480
So we just walk up to this gate

04:48:59.480 --> 04:49:01.480
and then we get to learn how French

04:49:01.480 --> 04:49:03.480
people say Italian dog

04:49:03.480 --> 04:49:05.480
which is

04:49:05.480 --> 04:49:07.480
Italian.

04:49:07.480 --> 04:49:09.480
Are you going to have any European

04:49:09.480 --> 04:49:11.480
friendly streams?

04:49:13.480 --> 04:49:15.480
Like, you mean

04:49:15.480 --> 04:49:17.480
starting earlier than the time I stream

04:49:17.480 --> 04:49:19.480
right now?

04:49:21.480 --> 04:49:23.480
This is probably going to be

04:49:23.480 --> 04:49:25.480
my stream start time until

04:49:25.480 --> 04:49:27.480
Daylight savings

04:49:27.480 --> 04:49:29.480
kicks in for some places.

04:49:31.480 --> 04:49:33.480
Which part of France

04:49:33.480 --> 04:49:35.480
are you from?

04:49:51.480 --> 04:49:53.480
It's EU friendly.

04:49:53.480 --> 04:49:55.480
It's 8pm.

04:49:55.480 --> 04:49:57.480
It's a bit late if you're like

04:49:57.480 --> 04:49:59.480
German ahead one.

04:50:03.480 --> 04:50:05.480
Is this a European friendly stream?

04:50:05.480 --> 04:50:07.480
Do we not like them?

04:50:07.480 --> 04:50:09.480
No, we do. It's just time zones.

04:50:09.480 --> 04:50:11.480
It's 4am when I start streaming.

04:50:11.480 --> 04:50:13.480
So,

04:50:13.480 --> 04:50:15.480
I'm trying my best.

04:50:15.480 --> 04:50:17.480
But I'm an endurance streamer so

04:50:17.480 --> 04:50:19.480
I do hit a lot of time zones.

04:50:19.480 --> 04:50:21.480
And it's unlikely

04:50:21.480 --> 04:50:23.480
that reeflings have

04:50:23.480 --> 04:50:25.480
8 hours to set through

04:50:25.480 --> 04:50:27.480
an entire stream.

04:50:27.480 --> 04:50:29.480
Maybe if you work from home

04:50:29.480 --> 04:50:31.480
or you're listening at work

04:50:31.480 --> 04:50:33.480
but it's a bit dangerous listening at work

04:50:33.480 --> 04:50:35.480
because sometimes I tease a lot.

04:50:35.480 --> 04:50:37.480
Especially in ASMR streams

04:50:37.480 --> 04:50:39.480
I tease quite a lot.

04:50:39.480 --> 04:50:41.480
This is me just having

04:50:41.480 --> 04:50:43.480
a really good time.

04:50:43.480 --> 04:50:45.480
So, I'm pretty tame right now from Brotherhood.

04:50:45.480 --> 04:50:47.480
Yeah.

04:50:47.480 --> 04:50:49.480
If you live in Turkaya

04:50:51.480 --> 04:50:53.480
Arcadijim

04:50:53.480 --> 04:50:55.480
means friend

04:50:55.480 --> 04:50:57.480
and

04:50:57.480 --> 04:50:59.480
Turkay.

04:50:59.480 --> 04:51:01.480
I think.

04:51:05.480 --> 04:51:07.480
Arcadij.

04:51:11.480 --> 04:51:13.480
I work from home

04:51:13.480 --> 04:51:15.480
and your endurance streams probably end when your work starts.

04:51:15.480 --> 04:51:17.480
So,

04:51:17.480 --> 04:51:19.480
I'm definitely going to be...

04:51:19.480 --> 04:51:21.480
How can you focus on work and listening at the same time though?

04:51:21.480 --> 04:51:23.480
I feel like I could...

04:51:23.480 --> 04:51:25.480
Unless it's like background noise.

04:51:25.480 --> 04:51:27.480
Arcadijim.

04:51:27.480 --> 04:51:29.480
I learned that from Assassin's Creed Revelations

04:51:29.480 --> 04:51:31.480
because it's set in Turkey.

04:51:31.480 --> 04:51:33.480
Never learn.

04:51:33.480 --> 04:51:35.480
Pfft.

04:51:41.480 --> 04:51:43.480
These guys are like the hardest enemies you can kind of get.

04:51:43.480 --> 04:51:45.480
But if you just jump at them

04:51:45.480 --> 04:51:47.480
you can get away with it.

04:51:47.480 --> 04:51:49.480
Oh yeah, you just got to break their stance

04:51:49.480 --> 04:51:51.480
and just look that down.

04:51:51.480 --> 04:51:53.480
That's back to me.

04:51:53.480 --> 04:51:55.480
The trick is, I don't really work.

04:51:55.480 --> 04:51:57.480
So, this cutscene

04:51:57.480 --> 04:51:59.480
is a glitch that was never patched out.

04:51:59.480 --> 04:52:01.480
This is a full edited cutscene

04:52:01.480 --> 04:52:03.480
where he like, go get my wife.

04:52:03.480 --> 04:52:05.480
It never loads.

04:52:05.480 --> 04:52:07.480
It will never load in time.

04:52:07.480 --> 04:52:09.480
I have no idea what it looks like.

04:52:09.480 --> 04:52:11.480
Well, I assume it looks like him

04:52:11.480 --> 04:52:13.480
screaming at you

04:52:13.480 --> 04:52:15.480
and then he gets his sword and goes off screen.

04:52:15.480 --> 04:52:17.480
It will never load.

04:52:17.480 --> 04:52:19.480
It doesn't matter what you do, it never loads.

04:52:19.480 --> 04:52:21.480
Unless like maybe someone went into the game data

04:52:21.480 --> 04:52:23.480
and like I went into free camera

04:52:23.480 --> 04:52:25.480
possibly

04:52:25.480 --> 04:52:27.480
and then you could definitely do it.

04:52:27.480 --> 04:52:29.480
I said small poles only!

04:52:31.480 --> 04:52:33.480
We don't want them being...

04:52:33.480 --> 04:52:35.480
No! You've ruined my screen!

04:52:37.480 --> 04:52:39.480
Okay, we did it though.

04:52:39.480 --> 04:52:41.480
It's fine.

04:52:41.480 --> 04:52:43.480
Can I open the gate please?

04:52:43.480 --> 04:52:45.480
Become anonymous to open the gate.

04:52:45.480 --> 04:52:47.480
There's no one attacking me.

04:52:49.480 --> 04:52:51.480
There's no one attacking me.

04:52:51.480 --> 04:52:53.480
Right, that's what I thought.

04:52:53.480 --> 04:52:55.480
I was going to say, there's literally no one attacking me.

04:52:57.480 --> 04:52:59.480
You underwaste my lack of shame.

04:52:59.480 --> 04:53:01.480
I'm pretty sick of stuff that worked before.

04:53:03.480 --> 04:53:05.480
Honestly, whatever helps pass the time

04:53:05.480 --> 04:53:07.480
like I'm sorry but work can be so mundane.

04:53:07.480 --> 04:53:09.480
Like the best work days

04:53:09.480 --> 04:53:11.480
are the times where you're super busy

04:53:11.480 --> 04:53:13.480
because you blink and it's the end of the day

04:53:13.480 --> 04:53:15.480
but you are shattered, that's the only problem

04:53:15.480 --> 04:53:17.480
like you're absolutely exhausted

04:53:17.480 --> 04:53:19.480
and it's really...

04:53:19.480 --> 04:53:21.480
So you're actually

04:53:21.480 --> 04:53:23.480
on a timer in this section

04:53:23.480 --> 04:53:25.480
and I only have six crossbow bolts

04:53:25.480 --> 04:53:27.480
which I do not like at all right now.

04:53:27.480 --> 04:53:29.480
Um...

04:53:29.480 --> 04:53:31.480
You can.

04:53:31.480 --> 04:53:33.480
I might mess up the sequence.

04:53:33.480 --> 04:53:35.480
I do it quite a lot.

04:53:35.480 --> 04:53:37.480
Don't look back, don't look back, don't look back!

04:53:43.480 --> 04:53:45.480
Okay, we did it, we did it, we did it.

04:53:45.480 --> 04:53:47.480
You need to air assassinate him for 100%.

04:53:49.480 --> 04:53:51.480
Hold on.

04:53:53.480 --> 04:53:55.480
You have no clue how many arrows I need to kill in the day.

04:53:57.480 --> 04:53:59.480
I'm respected.

04:54:01.480 --> 04:54:03.480
Yeah, I'm straight respected and not purchased.

04:54:11.480 --> 04:54:13.480
Oh, you should probably go to sleep

04:54:13.480 --> 04:54:15.480
if you need to be up in six hours.

04:54:15.480 --> 04:54:17.480
It's healthy to get eight hours of sleep.

04:54:17.480 --> 04:54:19.480
Digi, no!

04:54:19.480 --> 04:54:21.480
Men need eight hours of sleep

04:54:21.480 --> 04:54:23.480
where women typically need ten hours of sleep.

04:54:23.480 --> 04:54:25.480
But yeah,

04:54:25.480 --> 04:54:27.480
actually, don't risk your health.

04:54:29.480 --> 04:54:31.480
Sir Shameless, they call me.

04:54:33.480 --> 04:54:35.480
I'll be honest, all your girls

04:54:35.480 --> 04:54:37.480
make my work day go by real quick.

04:54:37.480 --> 04:54:39.480
It's lovely.

04:54:39.480 --> 04:54:41.480
That's amazing to hear.

04:54:41.480 --> 04:54:43.480
A.P. Gall confirmed the Lord.

04:54:45.480 --> 04:54:47.480
What is sleep?

04:54:47.480 --> 04:54:49.480
Baby, don't stream more.

04:54:49.480 --> 04:54:51.480
Don't stream more.

04:54:51.480 --> 04:54:53.480
No more.

04:54:53.480 --> 04:54:55.480
What is sleep?

04:54:55.480 --> 04:54:57.480
Streamer.

04:54:57.480 --> 04:54:59.480
Oh my god, a VTuber streamer parody of that song.

04:54:59.480 --> 04:55:01.480
Let's go.

04:55:03.480 --> 04:55:05.480
Okay.

04:55:05.480 --> 04:55:07.480
Then you can collect both of these chests

04:55:07.480 --> 04:55:09.480
if you're fast enough

04:55:09.480 --> 04:55:11.480
whilst it's telling you this act is over.

04:55:11.480 --> 04:55:13.480
I swear they purposely did this

04:55:13.480 --> 04:55:15.480
because no other act takes so long

04:55:15.480 --> 04:55:17.480
to complete the sequence six.

04:55:17.480 --> 04:55:19.480
Like the ending bit to tell you it's over.

04:55:19.480 --> 04:55:21.480
I decided a long time to destroy

04:55:21.480 --> 04:55:23.480
my sleep schedule.

04:55:23.480 --> 04:55:25.480
Practically, gal.

04:55:27.480 --> 04:55:29.480
Excuse me.

04:55:29.480 --> 04:55:31.480
Forget Pali.

04:55:37.480 --> 04:55:39.480
Worth it, feels good.

04:55:41.480 --> 04:55:43.480
Sleep, what is that?

04:55:43.480 --> 04:55:45.480
Oh, she caught me.

04:55:45.480 --> 04:55:47.480
If I can remember this sequence,

04:55:47.480 --> 04:55:49.480
we might have to

04:55:49.480 --> 04:55:51.480
do...

04:55:51.480 --> 04:55:53.480
Oh, that reminds me.

04:55:53.480 --> 04:55:55.480
There's actually a thieves challenge

04:55:55.480 --> 04:55:57.480
which is to dive

04:55:57.480 --> 04:55:59.480
200 meters, which you can do

04:55:59.480 --> 04:56:01.480
off the top of this building.

04:56:01.480 --> 04:56:03.480
So we might as well do it now because we're pretty high up.

04:56:03.480 --> 04:56:05.480
Ready, steady,

04:56:05.480 --> 04:56:07.480
whee!

04:56:07.480 --> 04:56:09.480
There we go.

04:56:09.480 --> 04:56:11.480
That's a thieves challenge done right there.

04:56:11.480 --> 04:56:13.480
Dive complete.

04:56:13.480 --> 04:56:15.480
Oh, I've got a hiring discount on the thieves.

04:56:15.480 --> 04:56:17.480
Fantastic.

04:56:17.480 --> 04:56:19.480
I enjoy that.

04:56:19.480 --> 04:56:21.480
I need to level them up a bit more before they pick pocket

04:56:21.480 --> 04:56:23.480
but we're getting close to the point where we don't

04:56:23.480 --> 04:56:25.480
like

04:56:25.480 --> 04:56:27.480
mula like that. Where'd any go on the map?

04:56:27.480 --> 04:56:29.480
Where are we?

04:56:29.480 --> 04:56:31.480
What's our heading?

04:56:31.480 --> 04:56:33.480
Okay, we've liberated

04:56:33.480 --> 04:56:35.480
that Borgia zone which is fantastic.

04:56:35.480 --> 04:56:37.480
Where's the mission?

04:56:37.480 --> 04:56:39.480
Is it south?

04:56:39.480 --> 04:56:41.480
The mission's in the thieves guild

04:56:41.480 --> 04:56:43.480
which doesn't have a Borgia place

04:56:43.480 --> 04:56:45.480
on the way but we'll start

04:56:45.480 --> 04:56:47.480
trying to get all the Borgia towers.

04:56:47.480 --> 04:56:49.480
I'm just going to use the old

04:56:49.480 --> 04:56:51.480
teleport feature.

04:56:53.480 --> 04:56:55.480
Yeah, yeah.

04:56:55.480 --> 04:56:57.480
And we'll send the assassin recruits on the way

04:56:57.480 --> 04:56:59.480
to get leveled up a bit more.

04:56:59.480 --> 04:57:01.480
Watching your streams of high level.

04:57:01.480 --> 04:57:03.480
Can you stop that?

04:57:03.480 --> 04:57:05.480
Try and make me blush.

04:57:05.480 --> 04:57:07.480
I literally just memed my bot off

04:57:07.480 --> 04:57:09.480
playing a really good game.

04:57:09.480 --> 04:57:11.480
Okay, we've got level 5

04:57:11.480 --> 04:57:13.480
so we're starting to get a bit...

04:57:13.480 --> 04:57:15.480
weapons now just so they have a few

04:57:15.480 --> 04:57:17.480
more things.

04:57:17.480 --> 04:57:19.480
We need to destroy a tower in order to get our third

04:57:19.480 --> 04:57:21.480
signal.

04:57:21.480 --> 04:57:23.480
Can I send you guys?

04:57:27.480 --> 04:57:29.480
I'm going to send everyone

04:57:29.480 --> 04:57:31.480
for the purpose of levelling up that level 1.

04:57:33.480 --> 04:57:35.480
Like to get them really levelled up from the start.

04:57:35.480 --> 04:57:37.480
So if they do end up in a fight

04:57:37.480 --> 04:57:39.480
it's not a problem.

04:57:39.480 --> 04:57:41.480
Is it working?

04:57:41.480 --> 04:57:43.480
Yes.

04:57:43.480 --> 04:57:45.480
Have you been killing people

04:57:45.480 --> 04:57:47.480
with your horse?

04:57:47.480 --> 04:57:49.480
Maybe they do.

04:57:49.480 --> 04:57:51.480
No.

04:57:51.480 --> 04:57:53.480
No.

04:57:53.480 --> 04:57:55.480
They're not buying it.

04:57:55.480 --> 04:57:57.480
He's like...

04:57:57.480 --> 04:57:59.480
He's out there.

04:57:59.480 --> 04:58:01.480
He looks like the...

04:58:01.480 --> 04:58:03.480
Oh no, the words aren't working

04:58:03.480 --> 04:58:05.480
in my head.

04:58:05.480 --> 04:58:07.480
Please don't shoot me.

04:58:07.480 --> 04:58:09.480
He looks up and

04:58:09.480 --> 04:58:11.480
he remembers.

04:58:11.480 --> 04:58:13.480
Ooh, I love birds.

04:58:13.480 --> 04:58:15.480
Not at the bird and

04:58:15.480 --> 04:58:17.480
people die everywhere.

04:58:17.480 --> 04:58:19.480
People die.

04:58:21.480 --> 04:58:23.480
I don't know the words.

04:58:23.480 --> 04:58:25.480
But like I know the tune and everything.

04:58:25.480 --> 04:58:27.480
Mmm.

04:58:29.480 --> 04:58:31.480
What's Johnny means?

04:58:31.480 --> 04:58:33.480
The most important meal of the day.

04:58:37.480 --> 04:58:39.480
Mmm.

04:58:39.480 --> 04:58:41.480
Mmm.

04:58:41.480 --> 04:58:43.480
We're going to not grab that thief

04:58:43.480 --> 04:58:45.480
because he's already claimed the wall.

04:58:45.480 --> 04:58:47.480
I never chase thieves.

04:58:47.480 --> 04:58:49.480
If they go up the wall, I cannot be bothered.

04:58:49.480 --> 04:58:51.480
I absolutely cannot be bothered.

04:58:51.480 --> 04:58:53.480
That's probably the only thing in this game

04:58:53.480 --> 04:58:55.480
that I'm just like, it doesn't matter.

04:58:55.480 --> 04:58:57.480
It's just like if you wanted to pocket the money

04:58:57.480 --> 04:58:59.480
and whatever item is on their persons.

04:59:01.480 --> 04:59:03.480
What am I doing?

04:59:03.480 --> 04:59:05.480
What?

04:59:05.480 --> 04:59:07.480
You guys want to do kegels together?

04:59:07.480 --> 04:59:09.480
Are you ready?

04:59:09.480 --> 04:59:11.480
Hold for three seconds.

04:59:11.480 --> 04:59:13.480
One, two, three, release.

04:59:13.480 --> 04:59:15.480
You know what?

04:59:15.480 --> 04:59:17.480
You know what I learned about guys?

04:59:17.480 --> 04:59:19.480
I learned this a while ago.

04:59:19.480 --> 04:59:21.480
If a guy wants to jump start

04:59:21.480 --> 04:59:23.480
his Eiffel Tower, he has to close

04:59:23.480 --> 04:59:25.480
his end.

04:59:25.480 --> 04:59:27.480
Which is crazy.

04:59:27.480 --> 04:59:29.480
A little twitch there.

04:59:29.480 --> 04:59:31.480
A little twitch there.

04:59:31.480 --> 04:59:33.480
A little twitch there I guess.

04:59:33.480 --> 04:59:35.480
Crazy lore for guys.

04:59:35.480 --> 04:59:37.480
Absolutely crazy lore.

04:59:37.480 --> 04:59:39.480
I don't know

04:59:39.480 --> 04:59:41.480
if I was too generic with that.

04:59:41.480 --> 04:59:43.480
In order to

04:59:43.480 --> 04:59:45.480
achieve sword art.

04:59:47.480 --> 04:59:49.480
Oh, and also

04:59:49.480 --> 04:59:51.480
when you go to the toilet,

04:59:51.480 --> 04:59:53.480
you're a poor little...

04:59:57.480 --> 04:59:59.480
What do we call them?

04:59:59.480 --> 05:00:01.480
You're a poor little...

05:00:01.480 --> 05:00:03.480
I don't know

05:00:03.480 --> 05:00:05.480
double eyeballs can touch

05:00:05.480 --> 05:00:07.480
the toilet and it's super cold

05:00:07.480 --> 05:00:09.480
and uncomfortable.

05:00:09.480 --> 05:00:11.480
I only learned that super recently

05:00:11.480 --> 05:00:13.480
because I saw a meme about it and I was like

05:00:13.480 --> 05:00:15.480
wait what?

05:00:15.480 --> 05:00:17.480
You're a poor little guy.

05:00:17.480 --> 05:00:19.480
They're going to retract

05:00:19.480 --> 05:00:21.480
and save you. They get too cold.

05:00:21.480 --> 05:00:23.480
They're going to go straight back

05:00:23.480 --> 05:00:25.480
up to your belly button. No!

05:00:27.480 --> 05:00:29.480
Kill all the attackers.

05:00:29.480 --> 05:00:31.480
Sure, sure, sure.

05:00:37.480 --> 05:00:39.480
Wait, why are we in this? Oh, it's a fight.

05:00:39.480 --> 05:00:41.480
It's a fight. And I just sent

05:00:41.480 --> 05:00:43.480
all my assassins away.

05:00:43.480 --> 05:00:45.480
Wait, who's the...

05:00:47.480 --> 05:00:49.480
Wrong guy.

05:00:49.480 --> 05:00:51.480
Wrong guy. You're hurting the wrong guy.

05:00:53.480 --> 05:00:55.480
Where are the enemies?

05:00:55.480 --> 05:00:57.480
Got an enemy.

05:00:57.480 --> 05:00:59.480
Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy.

05:00:59.480 --> 05:01:01.480
Enema, give them an enema.

05:01:03.480 --> 05:01:05.480
Do not give them an enema.

05:01:05.480 --> 05:01:07.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:01:07.480 --> 05:01:09.480
Whoa! That was so cool

05:01:09.480 --> 05:01:11.480
that attack. The double splash over.

05:01:11.480 --> 05:01:13.480
I really enjoyed that.

05:01:19.480 --> 05:01:21.480
What? What? Where did that come from?

05:01:21.480 --> 05:01:23.480
Eh, eh.

05:01:25.480 --> 05:01:27.480
Go away.

05:01:27.480 --> 05:01:29.480
They scare me. That's a renise.

05:01:29.480 --> 05:01:31.480
Bad boy, bad boy.

05:01:31.480 --> 05:01:33.480
Bad boy, bad boy.

05:01:33.480 --> 05:01:35.480
Bad boy.

05:01:35.480 --> 05:01:37.480
Oh, it missed.

05:01:41.480 --> 05:01:43.480
Okay, let's get this big guard.

05:01:43.480 --> 05:01:45.480
Oh, wait, I thought I killed him.

05:01:45.480 --> 05:01:47.480
I wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.

05:01:47.480 --> 05:01:49.480
I think I'm going to have to get food and refill

05:01:49.480 --> 05:01:51.480
in a second because I'm starting to

05:01:51.480 --> 05:01:53.480
get a little bit delirious.

05:01:53.480 --> 05:01:55.480
I'm going to get some egg

05:01:55.480 --> 05:01:57.480
and I think I'll go ravioli.

05:01:57.480 --> 05:01:59.480
Yeah.

05:01:59.480 --> 05:02:01.480
Maybe a wee bit longer.

05:02:01.480 --> 05:02:03.480
Maybe a three minute break.

05:02:03.480 --> 05:02:05.480
Three whole minutes away from stream. I cannot believe it.

05:02:05.480 --> 05:02:07.480
I cannot believe it. Absolutely unprofessional.

05:02:07.480 --> 05:02:09.480
Unacceptable.

05:02:11.480 --> 05:02:13.480
Oh, that makes sense.

05:02:15.480 --> 05:02:17.480
Everybody wants to be in the Assassin's Creed

05:02:17.480 --> 05:02:19.480
and Brotherhood does really

05:02:19.480 --> 05:02:21.480
quite work for the timing of the song.

05:02:21.480 --> 05:02:23.480
She hates us now.

05:02:25.480 --> 05:02:27.480
Hello.

05:02:27.480 --> 05:02:29.480
How many hours?

05:02:29.480 --> 05:02:31.480
Five hours? Oh, it's been five hours already.

05:02:31.480 --> 05:02:33.480
I've been gushing about this game.

05:02:33.480 --> 05:02:35.480
You know what, Reeflings?

05:02:35.480 --> 05:02:37.480
Life's good.

05:02:37.480 --> 05:02:39.480
Full stop. Life is good.

05:02:41.480 --> 05:02:43.480
Got to do my thing.

05:02:43.480 --> 05:02:45.480
We having a good time mimin' along.

05:02:45.480 --> 05:02:47.480
I'm rambling away about any old shite

05:02:47.480 --> 05:02:49.480
that passes my brain.

05:02:49.480 --> 05:02:51.480
Life is good.

05:02:53.480 --> 05:02:55.480
We're about to go get some juice.

05:02:55.480 --> 05:02:57.480
I think I'll make a tea.

05:02:57.480 --> 05:02:59.480
Yeah, I'll make a tea.

05:02:59.480 --> 05:03:01.480
You'll get some food.

05:03:01.480 --> 05:03:03.480
Maybe some snacky too.

05:03:03.480 --> 05:03:05.480
I don't think I need to pee.

05:03:05.480 --> 05:03:07.480
No pee yet.

05:03:09.480 --> 05:03:11.480
Actually, I should probably get up so I'm not that far behind him

05:03:11.480 --> 05:03:13.480
because he is like so far ahead of me.

05:03:15.480 --> 05:03:17.480
Oh no!

05:03:17.480 --> 05:03:19.480
I think he has perished.

05:03:19.480 --> 05:03:21.480
But thieves are ours.

05:03:21.480 --> 05:03:23.480
Yunkers, you're mine now.

05:03:25.480 --> 05:03:27.480
They are...

05:03:27.480 --> 05:03:29.480
I...

05:03:29.480 --> 05:03:31.480
I don't really want to kick him to death.

05:03:31.480 --> 05:03:33.480
Make it quick. See, don't make him suffer.

05:03:33.480 --> 05:03:35.480
My goodness.

05:03:35.480 --> 05:03:37.480
It's a bit morbid.

05:03:37.480 --> 05:03:39.480
I think I'd rather make it quick

05:03:39.480 --> 05:03:41.480
and painless, not drag it out.

05:03:41.480 --> 05:03:43.480
Oh, he got the horse! How did he do that?

05:03:43.480 --> 05:03:45.480
I don't know how he did that,

05:03:45.480 --> 05:03:47.480
but do it again.

05:03:47.480 --> 05:03:49.480
It looked like he did it with sort of.

05:03:53.480 --> 05:03:55.480
Well, it's 1am, so I'll take my leave.

05:03:55.480 --> 05:03:57.480
Please, rest well. Anyone who does have to rest

05:03:57.480 --> 05:03:59.480
or to sleepie bye bye.

05:03:59.480 --> 05:04:01.480
Please don't worry.

05:04:01.480 --> 05:04:03.480
Odds are. I'm actually still going to be streaming by the time you wake up.

05:04:03.480 --> 05:04:05.480
I said it.

05:04:05.480 --> 05:04:07.480
Yeah, it's true.

05:04:07.480 --> 05:04:09.480
It's true. I might finish the campaign

05:04:09.480 --> 05:04:11.480
and I might want to do some more. It's true.

05:04:11.480 --> 05:04:13.480
It's true. The accusations are true.

05:04:13.480 --> 05:04:15.480
So don't worry if you have to go to bed.

05:04:15.480 --> 05:04:17.480
I might see you when you wake up.

05:04:17.480 --> 05:04:19.480
So sweet dreams.

05:04:19.480 --> 05:04:21.480
See you in the morning.

05:04:23.480 --> 05:04:25.480
Jump off wall. Get kicked into wall.

05:04:27.480 --> 05:04:29.480
The accusations are true.

05:04:29.480 --> 05:04:31.480
I'm addicted.

05:04:31.480 --> 05:04:33.480
But not as much as I'm addicted to you.

05:04:33.480 --> 05:04:35.480
You guys might have the nicotine patch

05:04:35.480 --> 05:04:37.480
on your head, but the truth is

05:04:37.480 --> 05:04:39.480
under these bangs

05:04:39.480 --> 05:04:41.480
or fringe,

05:04:41.480 --> 05:04:43.480
I've got a nicotine patch too

05:04:43.480 --> 05:04:45.480
and it's covering my entire forehead.

05:04:49.480 --> 05:04:51.480
I wish I didn't send my sassons on that mission.

05:04:51.480 --> 05:04:53.480
Whoa.

05:04:53.480 --> 05:04:55.480
Okay, there we go.

05:04:55.480 --> 05:04:57.480
This is the Roman bath house.

05:04:57.480 --> 05:04:59.480
This is based on reveal, please.

05:04:59.480 --> 05:05:01.480
They are public bath houses.

05:05:03.480 --> 05:05:05.480
Okay, there's a lot going on. Hold on.

05:05:05.480 --> 05:05:07.480
There's a lot going on. Hold on.

05:05:07.480 --> 05:05:09.480
Big armor guy.

05:05:11.480 --> 05:05:13.480
My notoriety is going

05:05:13.480 --> 05:05:15.480
up.

05:05:15.480 --> 05:05:17.480
I like how he just swings that air.

05:05:17.480 --> 05:05:19.480
Can we get him while he's on the floor?

05:05:19.480 --> 05:05:21.480
Get him on the floor!

05:05:21.480 --> 05:05:23.480
Ow!

05:05:23.480 --> 05:05:25.480
Get him on the floor!

05:05:25.480 --> 05:05:27.480
Lavolpi!

05:05:27.480 --> 05:05:29.480
Old man.

05:05:29.480 --> 05:05:31.480
Put your Glex on.

05:05:31.480 --> 05:05:33.480
Put your Glex on.

05:05:33.480 --> 05:05:35.480
It's me!

05:05:37.480 --> 05:05:39.480
He plays in the first danote.

05:05:39.480 --> 05:05:41.480
He plays in the first danote.

05:05:41.480 --> 05:05:43.480
That was definitely a VA.

05:05:43.480 --> 05:05:45.480
They had used the law and they were like,

05:05:45.480 --> 05:05:47.480
please just use any other voice.

05:05:47.480 --> 05:05:49.480
It's going to be so obvious it's you.

05:05:49.480 --> 05:05:51.480
So he had to go,

05:05:51.480 --> 05:05:53.480
and play tonight.

05:05:53.480 --> 05:05:55.480
Or a V sucking.

05:05:55.480 --> 05:05:57.480
I don't have nicotine.

05:05:57.480 --> 05:05:59.480
I have B.L.R.

05:05:59.480 --> 05:06:01.480
That's so good.

05:06:01.480 --> 05:06:03.480
Sleep is for the weak. I don't know.

05:06:03.480 --> 05:06:05.480
Sleep is very healthy and apparently

05:06:05.480 --> 05:06:07.480
you sleep regularly.

05:06:07.480 --> 05:06:09.480
Then it's bad for your longevity.

05:06:09.480 --> 05:06:11.480
And you might expire.

05:06:11.480 --> 05:06:13.480
We don't really want...

05:06:13.480 --> 05:06:15.480
I don't really want you to expire in all honesty.

05:06:15.480 --> 05:06:17.480
I'm going to tell you the truth.

05:06:17.480 --> 05:06:19.480
I'd rather you didn't expire.

05:06:19.480 --> 05:06:21.480
So, please don't.

05:06:23.480 --> 05:06:25.480
We're getting some strawny time though.

05:06:25.480 --> 05:06:27.480
You're getting strawny time

05:06:27.480 --> 05:06:29.480
for a very long time every day.

05:06:29.480 --> 05:06:31.480
You're going to be sick of me.

05:06:31.480 --> 05:06:33.480
Yeah.

05:06:35.480 --> 05:06:37.480
Benenene.

05:06:37.480 --> 05:06:39.480
Benenene.

05:06:39.480 --> 05:06:41.480
The music's so good.

05:06:41.480 --> 05:06:43.480
There's also a feather on top of the Colosseum

05:06:43.480 --> 05:06:45.480
but we can get that at a later time.

05:06:45.480 --> 05:06:47.480
Mananana.

05:06:47.480 --> 05:06:49.480
Mananana.

05:06:49.480 --> 05:06:51.480
Mananana.

05:06:51.480 --> 05:06:53.480
We are...

05:06:53.480 --> 05:06:55.480
We expire.

05:06:55.480 --> 05:06:57.480
Survive for a moment.

05:06:57.480 --> 05:06:59.480
Not only am I putting you at war,

05:06:59.480 --> 05:07:01.480
I'm now expiring you manually.

05:07:01.480 --> 05:07:03.480
You have been expired.

05:07:03.480 --> 05:07:05.480
I literally glanced away

05:07:05.480 --> 05:07:07.480
and he was perfectly hidden behind Ezio.

05:07:07.480 --> 05:07:09.480
And I was like, oh, where is he?

05:07:09.480 --> 05:07:11.480
Enemies. Enemies.

05:07:11.480 --> 05:07:13.480
Enemies. Enemies.

05:07:13.480 --> 05:07:15.480
Give them an animal.

05:07:15.480 --> 05:07:17.480
Give the enemies an animal

05:07:17.480 --> 05:07:19.480
for how much?

05:07:19.480 --> 05:07:21.480
What the fuck?

05:07:21.480 --> 05:07:23.480
I don't know.

05:07:23.480 --> 05:07:25.480
I'm definitely using a quick

05:07:25.480 --> 05:07:27.480
a quick five minute break for you guys.

05:07:27.480 --> 05:07:29.480
I'll maybe read some Marshmallows

05:07:29.480 --> 05:07:31.480
and we'll take a five minute break.

05:07:31.480 --> 05:07:33.480
I'll eat and restore my

05:07:33.480 --> 05:07:35.480
hydration levels and stuff.

05:07:35.480 --> 05:07:37.480
Getting a wee bit delirious.

05:07:37.480 --> 05:07:39.480
Just a wee bit.

05:07:39.480 --> 05:07:41.480
Why is there so many guards this time?

05:07:41.480 --> 05:07:43.480
I don't really recall this game.

05:07:43.480 --> 05:07:45.480
Like this part having so many guards.

05:07:45.480 --> 05:07:47.480
Look at this guy on the edge

05:07:47.480 --> 05:07:49.480
over there.

05:07:49.480 --> 05:07:51.480
Oh, what?

05:07:51.480 --> 05:07:53.480
Are we all going?

05:07:53.480 --> 05:07:55.480
Okay, he's stuck.

05:07:55.480 --> 05:07:57.480
There. Okay, there we go.

05:07:57.480 --> 05:07:59.480
All good. All good in the head.

05:07:59.480 --> 05:08:01.480
She's got enemies on the brain.

05:08:01.480 --> 05:08:03.480
Freudian slip.

05:08:03.480 --> 05:08:05.480
Enemies. Enemies.

05:08:05.480 --> 05:08:07.480
Sorry, I stuck them out.

05:08:07.480 --> 05:08:09.480
It's like a really dumb...

05:08:09.480 --> 05:08:11.480
Can I summon Leonardo?

05:08:11.480 --> 05:08:13.480
I can. So on these benches

05:08:13.480 --> 05:08:15.480
is where you can buy more of Leonardo's

05:08:15.480 --> 05:08:17.480
inventions.

05:08:17.480 --> 05:08:19.480
Um...

05:08:19.480 --> 05:08:21.480
Is there a thing up there?

05:08:21.480 --> 05:08:23.480
No, it's on the other side.

05:08:23.480 --> 05:08:25.480
Leave me alone.

05:08:25.480 --> 05:08:27.480
Leave me alone.

05:08:27.480 --> 05:08:29.480
Never.

05:08:29.480 --> 05:08:31.480
Never.

05:08:31.480 --> 05:08:33.480
Leave me alone.

05:08:33.480 --> 05:08:35.480
Leave me alone.

05:08:35.480 --> 05:08:37.480
What did you ask the scrawny animal

05:08:37.480 --> 05:08:39.480
marriage when?

05:08:39.480 --> 05:08:41.480
You expect me to come in the middle

05:08:41.480 --> 05:08:43.480
of the night? Do you think I would?

05:08:47.480 --> 05:08:49.480
I drank a good stretch.

05:08:49.480 --> 05:08:51.480
Right, we'll finish this sequence

05:08:51.480 --> 05:08:53.480
because

05:08:53.480 --> 05:08:55.480
I think this is a quick sequence.

05:08:55.480 --> 05:08:57.480
I think we're already, like, pretty much getting through it.

05:08:57.480 --> 05:08:59.480
We're about to claim the costumes

05:08:59.480 --> 05:09:01.480
off of enemies.

05:09:01.480 --> 05:09:03.480
Do you think my assassin recruits

05:09:03.480 --> 05:09:05.480
have finished the mission?

05:09:11.480 --> 05:09:13.480
So, Lavalpe is now convinced

05:09:13.480 --> 05:09:15.480
Marquiovelli is a thief.

05:09:15.480 --> 05:09:17.480
It is a traitor

05:09:17.480 --> 05:09:19.480
because the events

05:09:19.480 --> 05:09:21.480
are synchronizing up too much.

05:09:21.480 --> 05:09:23.480
Cesare leaves the castle

05:09:23.480 --> 05:09:25.480
when

05:09:25.480 --> 05:09:27.480
he could have got tipped off.

05:09:27.480 --> 05:09:29.480
Marquiovelli uses guards

05:09:29.480 --> 05:09:31.480
to tell him secrets of the Borgia

05:09:31.480 --> 05:09:33.480
and

05:09:33.480 --> 05:09:35.480
Lavalpe finds it

05:09:35.480 --> 05:09:37.480
just far too suspicious

05:09:37.480 --> 05:09:39.480
and he's basically

05:09:39.480 --> 05:09:41.480
telling us

05:09:41.480 --> 05:09:43.480
if you do not put an end

05:09:43.480 --> 05:09:45.480
to Lavalpe

05:09:45.480 --> 05:09:47.480
to Marquiovelli

05:09:47.480 --> 05:09:49.480
I'll do it myself.

05:09:49.480 --> 05:09:51.480
Which is

05:09:51.480 --> 05:09:53.480
scary biscuits and scary bean.

05:09:53.480 --> 05:09:55.480
I'll leave the toes out of the blanket for you.

05:09:55.480 --> 05:09:57.480
Oh my god, did you hear my voice there?

05:09:57.480 --> 05:09:59.480
For you.

05:09:59.480 --> 05:10:01.480
For you.

05:10:01.480 --> 05:10:03.480
Would you still love me if I send it?

05:10:03.480 --> 05:10:05.480
Like, oh.

05:10:05.480 --> 05:10:07.480
I'm

05:10:07.480 --> 05:10:09.480
wrecking and decking.

05:10:09.480 --> 05:10:11.480
We're on sequence six.

05:10:11.480 --> 05:10:13.480
Act six and

05:10:13.480 --> 05:10:15.480
there's nine acts again.

05:10:17.480 --> 05:10:19.480
Yes, I write you would.

05:10:21.480 --> 05:10:23.480
Which was an accident.

05:10:33.480 --> 05:10:35.480
Italy lore, Italy lore.

05:10:43.480 --> 05:10:45.480
Can't believe it.

05:10:45.480 --> 05:10:47.480
He said I'm getting rid of Catholicism.

05:10:51.480 --> 05:10:53.480
I

05:10:55.480 --> 05:10:57.480
have friends that try to tell me that

05:10:57.480 --> 05:10:59.480
Assassin's Creed

05:10:59.480 --> 05:11:01.480
this Assassin's Creed brotherhood isn't a good game.

05:11:01.480 --> 05:11:03.480
There's so many kill mechanics

05:11:03.480 --> 05:11:05.480
in brotherhood. Wish they didn't

05:11:05.480 --> 05:11:07.480
steal the DLC though.

05:11:07.480 --> 05:11:09.480
Yeah.

05:11:09.480 --> 05:11:11.480
It's a shame.

05:11:11.480 --> 05:11:13.480
DLC was really the height.

05:11:15.480 --> 05:11:17.480
Oh.

05:11:17.480 --> 05:11:19.480
He said no one else is allowed

05:11:19.480 --> 05:11:21.480
I obey.

05:11:21.480 --> 05:11:23.480
Oh, that's what we should say to Sheebie.

05:11:23.480 --> 05:11:25.480
We obey.

05:11:25.480 --> 05:11:27.480
We obey.

05:11:27.480 --> 05:11:29.480
We obey Sheebie please.

05:11:31.480 --> 05:11:33.480
Okay, now this horse

05:11:33.480 --> 05:11:35.480
constantly gets turned around

05:11:35.480 --> 05:11:37.480
so you really can't be too close to him like at all.

05:11:37.480 --> 05:11:39.480
We obey Sheebie, we obey.

05:11:39.480 --> 05:11:41.480
We do not question, we obey.

05:11:45.480 --> 05:11:47.480
Just taking

05:11:47.480 --> 05:11:49.480
our time with this guy because

05:11:49.480 --> 05:11:51.480
he's so,

05:11:51.480 --> 05:11:53.480
he spins around so easily

05:11:53.480 --> 05:11:55.480
and you can desync so quick.

05:11:59.480 --> 05:12:01.480
Taking our time.

05:12:01.480 --> 05:12:03.480
Easy.

05:12:03.480 --> 05:12:05.480
Use it.

05:12:09.480 --> 05:12:11.480
This might be the longest hailing mission

05:12:11.480 --> 05:12:13.480
they've actually put in the game.

05:12:13.480 --> 05:12:15.480
Ah.

05:12:15.480 --> 05:12:17.480
The entire act is just

05:12:17.480 --> 05:12:19.480
hailing missions.

05:12:19.480 --> 05:12:21.480
Now don't get me wrong,

05:12:21.480 --> 05:12:23.480
I'm not one of those people that complain about the gameplay.

05:12:23.480 --> 05:12:25.480
If I complain about

05:12:25.480 --> 05:12:27.480
gameplay I would rather suggest

05:12:27.480 --> 05:12:29.480
something else that's supposed to happen

05:12:29.480 --> 05:12:31.480
but if you consider all the different

05:12:31.480 --> 05:12:33.480
types of mechanics

05:12:33.480 --> 05:12:35.480
or subjects

05:12:35.480 --> 05:12:37.480
that's put in the game, for example

05:12:37.480 --> 05:12:39.480
like the lair

05:12:39.480 --> 05:12:41.480
of Romulis

05:12:41.480 --> 05:12:43.480
or Leonardo's missions

05:12:43.480 --> 05:12:45.480
these are completely alternative.

05:12:45.480 --> 05:12:47.480
If you're gonna be like

05:12:47.480 --> 05:12:49.480
I don't really enjoy the hailing missions, I completely understand that.

05:12:49.480 --> 05:12:51.480
I'm not dogging on your comment by the way

05:12:51.480 --> 05:12:53.480
I'm just discussing it from

05:12:53.480 --> 05:12:55.480
if you ever wanted to

05:12:55.480 --> 05:12:57.480
review it. Oh by the way these guards

05:12:57.480 --> 05:12:59.480
useless. Absolutely useless.

05:13:01.480 --> 05:13:03.480
You can just walk straight in.

05:13:05.480 --> 05:13:07.480
I think you can also walk past these two

05:13:07.480 --> 05:13:09.480
if you get

05:13:09.480 --> 05:13:11.480
into that hay bale, they just forget you exist.

05:13:11.480 --> 05:13:13.480
They like think you're a far...

05:13:13.480 --> 05:13:15.480
OOOH!

05:13:15.480 --> 05:13:17.480
Woopsies! Woopsies! Woopsies!

05:13:17.480 --> 05:13:19.480
Woopsies! Woopsies!

05:13:19.480 --> 05:13:21.480
So it doesn't matter if the guards

05:13:21.480 --> 05:13:23.480
spot me, it's not a problem.

05:13:23.480 --> 05:13:25.480
Although if I run it does fulfill the

05:13:25.480 --> 05:13:27.480
can you go in the hay bale?

05:13:27.480 --> 05:13:29.480
Jeez, my goodness gravy.

05:13:29.480 --> 05:13:31.480
It's evil. Are you okay?

05:13:31.480 --> 05:13:33.480
I'm a little nervous now, honestly.

05:13:35.480 --> 05:13:37.480
You can, if they stop looking at me

05:13:37.480 --> 05:13:39.480
yep, okay, yeah.

05:13:39.480 --> 05:13:41.480
You hardly have to kill anyone

05:13:41.480 --> 05:13:43.480
in these kind of things.

05:13:43.480 --> 05:13:45.480
The game is so forgiving, that's why I absolutely

05:13:45.480 --> 05:13:47.480
adore about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

05:13:47.480 --> 05:13:49.480
It is so forgiving.

05:13:49.480 --> 05:13:51.480
Now don't get me wrong, you'll still get a few

05:13:51.480 --> 05:13:53.480
things where they're like, that shouldn't have got me, but

05:13:53.480 --> 05:13:55.480
yeah.

05:13:55.480 --> 05:13:57.480
It's so forgiving. So if you hide in the hay bale

05:13:57.480 --> 05:13:59.480
wait for this guy to come up and then

05:13:59.480 --> 05:14:01.480
send in a... oh he doesn't come up.

05:14:01.480 --> 05:14:03.480
Well wait for the guy to go

05:14:03.480 --> 05:14:05.480
away and then... yep, there you go.

05:14:05.480 --> 05:14:07.480
Boom! Cluster McCord.

05:14:09.480 --> 05:14:11.480
Boom!

05:14:13.480 --> 05:14:15.480
So...

05:14:15.480 --> 05:14:17.480
he gets on a horse

05:14:17.480 --> 05:14:19.480
you're actually supposed to go over here

05:14:19.480 --> 05:14:21.480
to get on a horse

05:14:21.480 --> 05:14:23.480
to continue to follow him.

05:14:25.480 --> 05:14:27.480
But it's not really obvious

05:14:27.480 --> 05:14:29.480
like most people would just chase on foot

05:14:29.480 --> 05:14:31.480
which is completely doable

05:14:31.480 --> 05:14:33.480
but for some reason they put the horses

05:14:33.480 --> 05:14:35.480
a wee bit to the left and

05:14:35.480 --> 05:14:37.480
uh, yeah.

05:14:38.480 --> 05:14:40.480
It's a bit harder to

05:14:40.480 --> 05:14:42.480
recognise, but yeah definitely this game

05:14:42.480 --> 05:14:44.480
if you've never played Assassin's Creed before

05:14:44.480 --> 05:14:46.480
I would actually...

05:14:46.480 --> 05:14:48.480
you'd miss out on the plot of 2

05:14:48.480 --> 05:14:50.480
which is the start of Itsu's story

05:14:50.480 --> 05:14:53.480
but mechanic and forgiveness wise

05:14:53.480 --> 05:14:55.480
if you're not really a strong gamer

05:14:55.480 --> 05:14:57.480
Brotherhood definitely is one for you.

05:14:59.480 --> 05:15:01.480
Ah my tummy's wumbling if you heard that

05:15:01.480 --> 05:15:03.480
You probably can't over the gameplay actually.

05:15:03.480 --> 05:15:05.480
The fact that you're passionate about the game

05:15:05.480 --> 05:15:07.480
it's just...

05:15:07.480 --> 05:15:09.480
you latch onto something, you can play a game

05:15:09.480 --> 05:15:11.480
and you have absolutely no idea what to expect

05:15:11.480 --> 05:15:13.480
and then you just adore it like a binding

05:15:13.480 --> 05:15:15.480
of Isaac is another game

05:15:15.480 --> 05:15:17.480
I didn't know what to expect

05:15:17.480 --> 05:15:19.480
and like the first time I played it

05:15:19.480 --> 05:15:21.480
I think I played it for like 5 hours and can't...

05:15:21.480 --> 05:15:23.480
He did the turnaround thing

05:15:23.480 --> 05:15:25.480
he's now supposed to do

05:15:25.480 --> 05:15:27.480
and now he's chasing me!

05:15:27.480 --> 05:15:29.480
Leave me alone!

05:15:29.480 --> 05:15:31.480
Oh my god...

05:15:31.480 --> 05:15:33.480
that was... that was gonna

05:15:33.480 --> 05:15:35.480
he sinks so hard all because he freaking

05:15:35.480 --> 05:15:37.480
turned around!

05:15:37.480 --> 05:15:39.480
I knew you were gonna do that

05:15:39.480 --> 05:15:41.480
I warned you guys

05:15:41.480 --> 05:15:43.480
he always turns around in this tailing mission

05:15:43.480 --> 05:15:45.480
he gets caught on NPCs

05:15:45.480 --> 05:15:47.480
and spins around

05:15:47.480 --> 05:15:49.480
and it scares me

05:15:49.480 --> 05:15:51.480
every time I never expect that

05:15:53.480 --> 05:15:55.480
he was chasing me though

05:15:55.480 --> 05:15:57.480
I don't normally expect them to like turn around

05:15:57.480 --> 05:15:59.480
and chase but I guess

05:15:59.480 --> 05:16:01.480
if you're close enough they will

05:16:03.480 --> 05:16:05.480
I'm also visiting your mom

05:16:07.480 --> 05:16:09.480
Have a nice visit

05:16:09.480 --> 05:16:11.480
sorry I was gonna say something really mean

05:16:11.480 --> 05:16:13.480
but I refrained

05:16:13.480 --> 05:16:15.480
I was gonna say

05:16:15.480 --> 05:16:17.480
I saw her earlier the day

05:16:17.480 --> 05:16:19.480
Oh he's done it again!

05:16:19.480 --> 05:16:21.480
No way I'm reading chat! Don't do that again!

05:16:21.480 --> 05:16:23.480
Don't do that again!

05:16:23.480 --> 05:16:25.480
You're giving me a heart attack

05:16:25.480 --> 05:16:27.480
Goodness me

05:16:27.480 --> 05:16:29.480
This Johnny's off to visit his mom

05:16:29.480 --> 05:16:31.480
Doing your mom!

05:16:31.480 --> 05:16:33.480
You know he's strictly doing your mom!

05:16:37.480 --> 05:16:39.480
So

05:16:39.480 --> 05:16:41.480
Oh!

05:16:41.480 --> 05:16:43.480
Please don't attack me

05:16:45.480 --> 05:16:47.480
Let the recruits deal with the

05:16:47.480 --> 05:16:49.480
Oh this isn't the right way!

05:16:49.480 --> 05:16:51.480
This isn't the way to victory

05:16:51.480 --> 05:16:53.480
to victory to victory

05:16:53.480 --> 05:16:55.480
This ain't the way to victory

05:16:55.480 --> 05:16:57.480
My assassins are now fighting it out

05:16:57.480 --> 05:16:59.480
I hope they're leveled up enough

05:16:59.480 --> 05:17:01.480
to deal with them

05:17:01.480 --> 05:17:03.480
to deal with them to deal with them

05:17:03.480 --> 05:17:05.480
I hope they're leveled up enough to deal with them

05:17:05.480 --> 05:17:07.480
because I don't have any more recruits

05:17:09.480 --> 05:17:11.480
Oh no I needed recruits to

05:17:11.480 --> 05:17:13.480
100% this mission

05:17:13.480 --> 05:17:15.480
Can I just stand about

05:17:15.480 --> 05:17:17.480
and wait for them to reappear

05:17:17.480 --> 05:17:19.480
because I am patient enough

05:17:19.480 --> 05:17:21.480
to do that

05:17:23.480 --> 05:17:25.480
Destruction! Destruction!

05:17:25.480 --> 05:17:27.480
Hmm

05:17:27.480 --> 05:17:29.480
Oh I want to play GTA 4 actually

05:17:31.480 --> 05:17:33.480
I need to go

05:17:33.480 --> 05:17:35.480
I want to go bowling

05:17:35.480 --> 05:17:37.480
Oh they didn't come

05:17:37.480 --> 05:17:39.480
They

05:17:39.480 --> 05:17:41.480
One more minute

05:17:41.480 --> 05:17:43.480
Oh look they've lost the health bar

05:17:43.480 --> 05:17:45.480
See that's why I always put it into health

05:17:45.480 --> 05:17:47.480
because they can make as many mistakes as they need to

05:17:47.480 --> 05:17:49.480
Wait why

05:17:49.480 --> 05:17:51.480
am I getting yellowed

05:17:51.480 --> 05:17:53.480
Why am I getting yellowed

05:17:53.480 --> 05:17:55.480
My assassin recruits are going ham

05:17:55.480 --> 05:17:57.480
Am I not going to be detected? I bloody hope not

05:17:57.480 --> 05:17:59.480
Right that's fine

05:17:59.480 --> 05:18:01.480
I can be detected

05:18:01.480 --> 05:18:03.480
Who is shooting?

05:18:03.480 --> 05:18:05.480
What is going on over there?

05:18:05.480 --> 05:18:07.480
Do you not need to reload?

05:18:07.480 --> 05:18:09.480
Hello?

05:18:11.480 --> 05:18:13.480
They just despawned

05:18:13.480 --> 05:18:15.480
Okay well as long as they're not dead

05:18:15.480 --> 05:18:17.480
I guess jeez

05:18:19.480 --> 05:18:21.480
Strudy!

05:18:21.480 --> 05:18:23.480
Why not name your

05:18:23.480 --> 05:18:25.480
Bro

05:18:25.480 --> 05:18:27.480
Someone in chat has named himself

05:18:27.480 --> 05:18:29.480
Fondle of bosom

05:18:29.480 --> 05:18:31.480
Frickin

05:18:31.480 --> 05:18:33.480
I can't see it anymore

05:18:33.480 --> 05:18:35.480
Did mods time you ever for that?

05:18:35.480 --> 05:18:37.480
That's hilarious

05:18:37.480 --> 05:18:39.480
I read that

05:18:39.480 --> 05:18:41.480
Fondle of bosom

05:18:41.480 --> 05:18:43.480
Gen 0 be sucky

05:18:43.480 --> 05:18:45.480
I don't see it anymore

05:18:45.480 --> 05:18:47.480
Mods timed out it was funny

05:18:47.480 --> 05:18:49.480
Unless you were spamming then get bonked

05:18:49.480 --> 05:18:51.480
I have to admit

05:18:53.480 --> 05:18:55.480
I almost ran out of time there

05:18:55.480 --> 05:18:57.480
I'm too busy reading chat

05:18:57.480 --> 05:18:59.480
I literally sounded like a monkey there

05:18:59.480 --> 05:19:01.480
I'm not even pretending

05:19:01.480 --> 05:19:03.480
I almost ran out of time

05:19:05.480 --> 05:19:07.480
Alright do not turn around again

05:19:07.480 --> 05:19:09.480
I'm going to be so upset

05:19:09.480 --> 05:19:11.480
I don't think he does it too much in this sequence part

05:19:11.480 --> 05:19:13.480
I don't know

05:19:13.480 --> 05:19:15.480
It's the ghost of Christmas pass

05:19:19.480 --> 05:19:21.480
Oh my

05:19:21.480 --> 05:19:23.480
Oh my

05:19:23.480 --> 05:19:25.480
My voice

05:19:25.480 --> 05:19:27.480
My voice

05:19:27.480 --> 05:19:29.480
Literally can't right now

05:19:31.480 --> 05:19:33.480
Oh he's getting really far head actually

05:19:33.480 --> 05:19:35.480
Hold on sorry I'm just really enjoying

05:19:35.480 --> 05:19:37.480
Reading chat with you

05:19:37.480 --> 05:19:39.480
I apologize

05:19:39.480 --> 05:19:41.480
Because I remember that people enjoy

05:19:41.480 --> 05:19:43.480
When they get their stuff read out

05:19:43.480 --> 05:19:45.480
I never did my high

05:19:45.480 --> 05:19:47.480
thing

05:19:47.480 --> 05:19:49.480
Could I do the high thing?

05:19:49.480 --> 05:19:51.480
Like so sometimes

05:19:51.480 --> 05:19:53.480
When I started upstream I would actually

05:19:53.480 --> 05:19:55.480
Read everyone's name out just to try

05:19:55.480 --> 05:19:57.480
To be super thankful

05:19:57.480 --> 05:19:59.480
Maybe for the ASMR stream

05:19:59.480 --> 05:20:01.480
We could try it

05:20:01.480 --> 05:20:03.480
Because I understand

05:20:03.480 --> 05:20:05.480
People want to hear their

05:20:05.480 --> 05:20:07.480
Name be said by me

05:20:07.480 --> 05:20:09.480
Because it's nice to be acknowledged

05:20:09.480 --> 05:20:11.480
Let's not pretend

05:20:11.480 --> 05:20:13.480
It's not nice to have

05:20:13.480 --> 05:20:15.480
Strummer reply directly type thing

05:20:15.480 --> 05:20:17.480
Orally generally discuss it

05:20:17.480 --> 05:20:19.480
So maybe in the ASMR stream

05:20:19.480 --> 05:20:21.480
As a one off I will try my best

05:20:21.480 --> 05:20:23.480
To say hi to everyone

05:20:23.480 --> 05:20:25.480
You there

05:20:25.480 --> 05:20:27.480
Perish

05:20:27.480 --> 05:20:29.480
That's a lot of enemies

05:20:29.480 --> 05:20:31.480
I got enemies

05:20:31.480 --> 05:20:33.480
I'm calling in my recruits

05:20:33.480 --> 05:20:35.480
Okay let's get to the fight

05:20:37.480 --> 05:20:39.480
Take this

05:20:39.480 --> 05:20:41.480
And this

05:20:41.480 --> 05:20:43.480
And that

05:20:43.480 --> 05:20:45.480
And

05:20:47.480 --> 05:20:49.480
I actually

05:20:49.480 --> 05:20:51.480
I'm gonna heal up

05:20:51.480 --> 05:20:53.480
And try and pick up a medicine vial

05:20:55.480 --> 05:20:57.480
Real names or username

05:20:57.480 --> 05:20:59.480
I would never encourage anyone

05:20:59.480 --> 05:21:01.480
To use their real name

05:21:01.480 --> 05:21:03.480
On the internet

05:21:03.480 --> 05:21:05.480
I name yourself

05:21:05.480 --> 05:21:07.480
Something funny

05:21:07.480 --> 05:21:09.480
Or a meme or after

05:21:09.480 --> 05:21:11.480
A video game for example

05:21:13.480 --> 05:21:15.480
There's no way I'm getting

05:21:15.480 --> 05:21:17.480
Is he gonna leave me alone or doesn't he hurt him

05:21:17.480 --> 05:21:19.480
I'm gonna hurt you if you come any closer

05:21:23.480 --> 05:21:25.480
It's you you're aimbot

05:21:25.480 --> 05:21:27.480
Your armor is not that good sir

05:21:27.480 --> 05:21:29.480
I know for a fact your armor is not that good

05:21:31.480 --> 05:21:33.480
Give me my crossbow bolt back

05:21:33.480 --> 05:21:35.480
Right now I know you have some on your persons

05:21:35.480 --> 05:21:37.480
Not the knife

05:21:37.480 --> 05:21:39.480
It's not a knife

05:21:39.480 --> 05:21:41.480
That's a sword

05:21:41.480 --> 05:21:43.480
You gave me my crossbow bolt back

05:21:43.480 --> 05:21:45.480
That's exactly what I thought

05:21:45.480 --> 05:21:47.480
You're not that guy

05:21:47.480 --> 05:21:49.480
I started doing a marathon

05:21:49.480 --> 05:21:51.480
Imagine if you did Arkham Knight

05:21:51.480 --> 05:21:53.480
I do play Batman and go play the Batman

05:21:53.480 --> 05:21:55.480
Please don't stop

05:21:55.480 --> 05:21:57.480
And look at me

05:21:57.480 --> 05:21:59.480
Please don't stop

05:22:03.480 --> 05:22:05.480
The assassin should kill that third guy

05:22:05.480 --> 05:22:07.480
What is going on

05:22:07.480 --> 05:22:09.480
Why is it so loud when you guys

05:22:09.480 --> 05:22:11.480
Kill people

05:22:11.480 --> 05:22:13.480
Okay now the whole

05:22:13.480 --> 05:22:15.480
Of like

05:22:15.480 --> 05:22:17.480
Roma knows that you're like shooting

05:22:17.480 --> 05:22:19.480
Guns over there

05:22:23.480 --> 05:22:25.480
Oh my god it's Fond de la Buzum

05:22:25.480 --> 05:22:27.480
I can't believe it are you gonna like roleplay

05:22:27.480 --> 05:22:29.480
Zero in chat

05:22:33.480 --> 05:22:35.480
Damn hope to see it

05:22:35.480 --> 05:22:37.480
Long as please

05:22:37.480 --> 05:22:39.480
I am much in your debt

05:22:41.480 --> 05:22:43.480
He acts on stage

05:22:43.480 --> 05:22:45.480
One of my men will

05:22:45.480 --> 05:22:47.480
I guess you would go through the live chat participants

05:22:47.480 --> 05:22:49.480
Wait I can see a list of everyone watching

05:22:49.480 --> 05:22:51.480
No that's only on Twitch

05:22:53.480 --> 05:22:55.480
Like maybe at the start

05:22:55.480 --> 05:22:57.480
Of this ASMR

05:22:57.480 --> 05:22:59.480
As a one off cause like it's just not plausible to like keep up

05:22:59.480 --> 05:23:01.480
But just as a thank you for like showing up

05:23:01.480 --> 05:23:03.480
Still being here still meaming around

05:23:03.480 --> 05:23:05.480
Um

05:23:05.480 --> 05:23:07.480
I haven't played Assassin's Creed

05:23:07.480 --> 05:23:09.480
But it seems similar to Arkham Knights

05:23:09.480 --> 05:23:11.480
I

05:23:11.480 --> 05:23:13.480
Wouldn't entirely disagree

05:23:13.480 --> 05:23:15.480
Very agile

05:23:15.480 --> 05:23:17.480
Um

05:23:17.480 --> 05:23:19.480
Very agility based

05:23:19.480 --> 05:23:21.480
Definitely

05:23:21.480 --> 05:23:23.480
Um

05:23:23.480 --> 05:23:25.480
You know hunting around

05:23:25.480 --> 05:23:27.480
This 100% is just don't kill anyone

05:23:27.480 --> 05:23:29.480
If you scoot your bot all the way

05:23:29.480 --> 05:23:31.480
Along the coliseum

05:23:31.480 --> 05:23:33.480
Absolutely no issues

05:23:33.480 --> 05:23:35.480
You shouldn't run into any guards if you do

05:23:35.480 --> 05:23:37.480
You can literally just hang off the ledge

05:23:37.480 --> 05:23:39.480
I wish I had the climbing glove though

05:23:39.480 --> 05:23:41.480
That Leonardo bench would have came in clutch

05:23:41.480 --> 05:23:43.480
For this part of the

05:23:43.480 --> 05:23:45.480
Section

05:23:45.480 --> 05:23:47.480
But unfortunately

05:23:47.480 --> 05:23:49.480
I don't have that where am I supposed to go

05:23:49.480 --> 05:23:51.480
Uh

05:23:51.480 --> 05:23:53.480
So the watch point is all the way

05:23:53.480 --> 05:23:55.480
Oh my god that stance

05:23:55.480 --> 05:23:57.480
It actually looks pretty funny

05:24:01.480 --> 05:24:03.480
Okay

05:24:03.480 --> 05:24:05.480
We're gonna go for this

05:24:05.480 --> 05:24:07.480
What

05:24:07.480 --> 05:24:09.480
Whoa I didn't even realize that guard could see me

05:24:09.480 --> 05:24:11.480
What? How could he even see me

05:24:11.480 --> 05:24:13.480
We'll go for the viewpoint

05:24:13.480 --> 05:24:15.480
And then we will

05:24:15.480 --> 05:24:17.480
Continue with this mission this act is getting

05:24:17.480 --> 05:24:19.480
Very close to being finished

05:24:19.480 --> 05:24:21.480
And then we will have a five minute break

05:24:21.480 --> 05:24:23.480
I will read any marshmallows

05:24:23.480 --> 05:24:25.480
So if you want to ask any questions

05:24:25.480 --> 05:24:27.480
Or more than can

05:24:27.480 --> 05:24:29.480
I did miss some like during

05:24:29.480 --> 05:24:31.480
The 2.0 and

05:24:31.480 --> 05:24:33.480
The exposing

05:24:33.480 --> 05:24:35.480
Just because

05:24:35.480 --> 05:24:37.480
Not that it wasn't good enough

05:24:37.480 --> 05:24:39.480
But maybe it wasn't like on subject

05:24:39.480 --> 05:24:41.480
Or didn't quite necessarily relate to me

05:24:41.480 --> 05:24:43.480
Like for the 2.0

05:24:43.480 --> 05:24:45.480
So I just sent it

05:24:45.480 --> 05:24:47.480
I might give that a good week

05:24:47.480 --> 05:24:49.480
But you're welcome to ask any questions

05:24:49.480 --> 05:24:51.480
We will rehydrate

05:24:51.480 --> 05:24:53.480
I'm getting a T

05:24:53.480 --> 05:24:55.480
My voice is perishing

05:24:55.480 --> 05:24:57.480
Where am I supposed to go

05:24:57.480 --> 05:24:59.480
Over there

05:24:59.480 --> 05:25:01.480
There is a feather on top

05:25:01.480 --> 05:25:03.480
Of the Colosseum but I'm actually happy

05:25:03.480 --> 05:25:05.480
To just climb up again okay that's where we're supposed

05:25:05.480 --> 05:25:07.480
To go

05:25:07.480 --> 05:25:09.480
Couldn't see it because of the

05:25:09.480 --> 05:25:11.480
Render distance but that's okay

05:25:11.480 --> 05:25:13.480
Because this is an older game

05:25:15.480 --> 05:25:17.480
If you look at the three dots

05:25:17.480 --> 05:25:19.480
Where it has time stamp and reactions

05:25:19.480 --> 05:25:21.480
And option to pop out chat

05:25:21.480 --> 05:25:23.480
It says participants I think it's just chatters

05:25:23.480 --> 05:25:25.480
That have typed in chat

05:25:25.480 --> 05:25:27.480
I was just going to get you all to be like hi

05:25:27.480 --> 05:25:29.480
And then start reading your name

05:25:29.480 --> 05:25:31.480
Ear to ear

05:25:33.480 --> 05:25:35.480
Senor

05:25:35.480 --> 05:25:37.480
I've been going away for the last hour

05:25:37.480 --> 05:25:39.480
No you haven't missed a thing

05:25:39.480 --> 05:25:41.480
I'm giving away we are on

05:25:41.480 --> 05:25:43.480
A sequence

05:25:43.480 --> 05:25:45.480
Six

05:25:45.480 --> 05:25:47.480
Which is

05:25:47.480 --> 05:25:49.480
My god

05:25:49.480 --> 05:25:51.480
Why has thou forsaken

05:25:51.480 --> 05:25:53.480
Mhmm

05:25:53.480 --> 05:25:55.480
Mhmm

05:25:55.480 --> 05:25:57.480
Right heading out

05:25:57.480 --> 05:25:59.480
Thank you for hanging again

05:25:59.480 --> 05:26:01.480
Anyone who is watching you've done so far

05:26:01.480 --> 05:26:03.480
You've done well so far

05:26:03.480 --> 05:26:05.480
It's five and a half hours

05:26:05.480 --> 05:26:07.480
I don't want to expect you to be here for the film

05:26:07.480 --> 05:26:09.480
Please rest when you can

05:26:09.480 --> 05:26:11.480
And also

05:26:11.480 --> 05:26:13.480
Emi is streaming ASMR live if you'd like to check that out

05:26:13.480 --> 05:26:15.480
Emi Bezo she has linked below

05:26:15.480 --> 05:26:17.480
In my description

05:26:17.480 --> 05:26:19.480
Thank you so much

05:26:21.480 --> 05:26:23.480
Uh

05:26:23.480 --> 05:26:25.480
So please don't be afraid to check out her ASMRs

05:26:25.480 --> 05:26:27.480
We are about to finish up the sequence

05:26:27.480 --> 05:26:29.480
We just need to eliminate

05:26:29.480 --> 05:26:31.480
These three guards that come up

05:26:31.480 --> 05:26:33.480
And then deal with the poison sequence

05:26:33.480 --> 05:26:35.480
And then I believe

05:26:37.480 --> 05:26:39.480
That the sequence is over

05:26:39.480 --> 05:26:41.480
We are getting

05:26:41.480 --> 05:26:43.480
Very close to finishing

05:26:43.480 --> 05:26:45.480
The campaign

05:26:45.480 --> 05:26:47.480
Very very close

05:26:47.480 --> 05:26:49.480
Just run all the way around the call

05:26:49.480 --> 05:26:51.480
Until you get up to the hay bale

05:26:51.480 --> 05:26:53.480
There is a treasure chest I always ignore

05:26:53.480 --> 05:26:55.480
We can always come back for it later

05:26:55.480 --> 05:26:57.480
There you go

05:26:57.480 --> 05:26:59.480
You can instantly assassinate the hay bale

05:26:59.480 --> 05:27:01.480
And oh it's four targets

05:27:01.480 --> 05:27:03.480
Excuse me

05:27:03.480 --> 05:27:05.480
Such a fakey gamer

05:27:05.480 --> 05:27:07.480
Again crossbow bolts are

05:27:07.480 --> 05:27:09.480
Completely silent

05:27:09.480 --> 05:27:11.480
They will not

05:27:11.480 --> 05:27:13.480
Allure anyone to what has happened

05:27:13.480 --> 05:27:15.480
In the area

05:27:15.480 --> 05:27:17.480
Which is very nice

05:27:17.480 --> 05:27:19.480
Unfortunately I'm running

05:27:19.480 --> 05:27:21.480
Rather low on crossbow bolts

05:27:21.480 --> 05:27:23.480
We are going to wait for this last guy

05:27:23.480 --> 05:27:25.480
To come out on his own

05:27:25.480 --> 05:27:27.480
Because if you actually go in there

05:27:27.480 --> 05:27:29.480
There is a high chance of him just like straight up

05:27:29.480 --> 05:27:31.480
Turning around and looking at you

05:27:31.480 --> 05:27:33.480
And then you have to replay this little section again

05:27:33.480 --> 05:27:35.480
Don't recommend it up to you

05:27:35.480 --> 05:27:37.480
But he will notice the body

05:27:37.480 --> 05:27:39.480
And then you get the perfect kill

05:27:39.480 --> 05:27:41.480
I'm going to loot his body

05:27:41.480 --> 05:27:43.480
Just because again we are a bit low on crossbow bolts

05:27:43.480 --> 05:27:45.480
What the fuck is

05:27:45.480 --> 05:27:47.480
And then you just need to jump down

05:27:47.480 --> 05:27:49.480
On this little

05:27:49.480 --> 05:27:51.480
How do you call it

05:27:51.480 --> 05:27:53.480
Hanging

05:27:53.480 --> 05:27:55.480
Okay

05:27:55.480 --> 05:27:57.480
Or just don't touch

05:27:57.480 --> 05:27:59.480
Any of it and land on your ankles

05:27:59.480 --> 05:28:01.480
Perfectly fine, don't need them

05:28:01.480 --> 05:28:03.480
Just completely ignore everything

05:28:03.480 --> 05:28:05.480
My goodness

05:28:05.480 --> 05:28:07.480
You saw me reach my armor

05:28:11.480 --> 05:28:13.480
Just fall to the floor

05:28:13.480 --> 05:28:15.480
Literally splat

05:28:15.480 --> 05:28:17.480
You may notice that our health bar

05:28:17.480 --> 05:28:19.480
Is increasing even though I'm not

05:28:19.480 --> 05:28:21.480
Buying any new armor or anything

05:28:21.480 --> 05:28:23.480
That's because after every act

05:28:23.480 --> 05:28:25.480
You unlock a new health bar

05:28:25.480 --> 05:28:27.480
So it's not necessary to use your

05:28:27.480 --> 05:28:29.480
Florence on

05:28:29.480 --> 05:28:31.480
Armor but

05:28:31.480 --> 05:28:33.480
If you definitely are new to the

05:28:33.480 --> 05:28:35.480
Assassin's Creed it helps out so much

05:28:35.480 --> 05:28:37.480
It's fantastic and please

05:28:37.480 --> 05:28:39.480
Utilize the tailor's

05:28:39.480 --> 05:28:41.480
Shops because tailor's shops

05:28:41.480 --> 05:28:43.480
Have pouches that increase

05:28:43.480 --> 05:28:45.480
How much medicine you can hold

05:28:45.480 --> 05:28:47.480
How much throwing

05:28:47.480 --> 05:28:49.480
Knives, how many crossbow bolts for example

05:28:53.480 --> 05:28:55.480
I cannot recommend this game

05:28:55.480 --> 05:28:57.480
Seriously

05:28:57.480 --> 05:28:59.480
It's about 8 hours total

05:28:59.480 --> 05:29:01.480
For campaign if you just ignore everything

05:29:01.480 --> 05:29:03.480
If you want to have a good time and explore

05:29:03.480 --> 05:29:05.480
You could easily pump

05:29:05.480 --> 05:29:07.480
Maybe 16 hours

05:29:07.480 --> 05:29:09.480
It's good

05:29:09.480 --> 05:29:11.480
Good game

05:29:11.480 --> 05:29:13.480
My knees could never do that

05:29:13.480 --> 05:29:15.480
No, I don't think anyone's knees

05:29:15.480 --> 05:29:17.480
Could have accomplished such a feat

05:29:17.480 --> 05:29:19.480
Although I could have sworn

05:29:19.480 --> 05:29:21.480
I saw some videos

05:29:21.480 --> 05:29:23.480
Of like

05:29:23.480 --> 05:29:25.480
You know in Portal 2

05:29:25.480 --> 05:29:27.480
The apparatus that's on the legs

05:29:27.480 --> 05:29:29.480
To stop any fall damage from occurring

05:29:29.480 --> 05:29:31.480
I'm sure someone was developing that tech

05:29:31.480 --> 05:29:33.480
At one point

05:29:33.480 --> 05:29:35.480
Like maybe for super soldier

05:29:35.480 --> 05:29:37.480
But yeah

05:29:39.480 --> 05:29:41.480
Are you on steam?

05:29:41.480 --> 05:29:43.480
Yeah, I'm playing on steam right now

05:29:43.480 --> 05:29:45.480
I was gonna try

05:29:45.480 --> 05:29:47.480
And do

05:29:47.480 --> 05:29:49.480
Do an Xbox Game Pass

05:29:49.480 --> 05:29:51.480
But it's not currently on it right now

05:29:51.480 --> 05:29:53.480
So

05:29:53.480 --> 05:29:55.480
We don't get the gamer score

05:29:55.480 --> 05:29:57.480
You cannot say Pietro

05:29:57.480 --> 05:29:59.480
Yeah

05:29:59.480 --> 05:30:01.480
The wine he drank was poison

05:30:01.480 --> 05:30:03.480
As I promised Cesare

05:30:03.480 --> 05:30:05.480
Poison stinky

05:30:05.480 --> 05:30:07.480
Can anyone look up

05:30:07.480 --> 05:30:09.480
If Cuttlefish have poison

05:30:09.480 --> 05:30:11.480
I don't know my lore

05:30:11.480 --> 05:30:13.480
I did not come here to kill you

05:30:13.480 --> 05:30:15.480
Maybe my poison can...

05:30:15.480 --> 05:30:17.480
Oh, well I do ink, but is ink poisonous?

05:30:17.480 --> 05:30:19.480
No, it's a deterrent

05:30:19.480 --> 05:30:21.480
Cause I can be preyed upon

05:30:21.480 --> 05:30:23.480
So ink is to hate me

05:30:23.480 --> 05:30:25.480
I can be

05:30:25.480 --> 05:30:27.480
Heck yeah I can

05:30:27.480 --> 05:30:29.480
You know see my teeth

05:30:29.480 --> 05:30:31.480
This was not in rehearsal

05:30:31.480 --> 05:30:33.480
I wish I had aim like that

05:30:33.480 --> 05:30:35.480
That's cool

05:30:35.480 --> 05:30:37.480
Actually that's a really

05:30:37.480 --> 05:30:39.480
I would

05:30:39.480 --> 05:30:41.480
No

05:30:41.480 --> 05:30:43.480
Maybe

05:30:43.480 --> 05:30:45.480
Do you think we could set up axe throwing

05:30:45.480 --> 05:30:47.480
At a VTuber convention?

05:30:47.480 --> 05:30:49.480
I feel like that would be so fun

05:30:49.480 --> 05:30:51.480
Legend of people

05:30:51.480 --> 05:30:53.480
Like can hit the spot or not

05:30:53.480 --> 05:30:55.480
I feel like it's so specific

05:30:55.480 --> 05:30:57.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa Jesus

05:30:57.480 --> 05:30:59.480
Pick him up, pick him up

05:30:59.480 --> 05:31:01.480
Quite literally Jesus

05:31:01.480 --> 05:31:03.480
Oh his health is going down

05:31:03.480 --> 05:31:05.480
Cause of the poison

05:31:05.480 --> 05:31:07.480
I've never noticed that before

05:31:09.480 --> 05:31:11.480
Other way

05:31:11.480 --> 05:31:13.480
Sorry assassin recruits

05:31:13.480 --> 05:31:15.480
I'm gonna need you to like hurry up and perish

05:31:15.480 --> 05:31:17.480
These people like right now Pietro is

05:31:17.480 --> 05:31:19.480
Oh

05:31:21.480 --> 05:31:23.480
That's a reefling

05:31:23.480 --> 05:31:25.480
After I'm done with him in the ASMR booth

05:31:33.480 --> 05:31:35.480
If you team up a company that does axe throwing

05:31:37.480 --> 05:31:39.480
Me next

05:31:39.480 --> 05:31:41.480
Me next

05:31:45.480 --> 05:31:47.480
This is me giving you cola

05:31:47.480 --> 05:31:49.480
To make you feel better

05:31:49.480 --> 05:31:51.480
Give me the keys

05:31:53.480 --> 05:31:55.480
The castello

05:31:55.480 --> 05:31:57.480
Oh did I tell you that

05:31:57.480 --> 05:31:59.480
After

05:32:15.480 --> 05:32:17.480
It's the real traitor

05:32:17.480 --> 05:32:19.480
It's not Marquia Valley at all

05:32:21.480 --> 05:32:23.480
It's you

05:32:23.480 --> 05:32:25.480
Random thief from cutscene

05:32:25.480 --> 05:32:27.480
Oh no

05:32:27.480 --> 05:32:29.480
No, no, no, no

05:32:29.480 --> 05:32:31.480
Horse, please

05:32:31.480 --> 05:32:33.480
Please

05:32:33.480 --> 05:32:35.480
I can't chase my horse right now

05:32:35.480 --> 05:32:37.480
I don't know

05:32:37.480 --> 05:32:39.480
I think if I fail this section

05:32:39.480 --> 05:32:41.480
If you jump you can jump past the guards

05:32:41.480 --> 05:32:43.480
In the AI no longer targets you

05:32:43.480 --> 05:32:45.480
I don't know why

05:32:45.480 --> 05:32:47.480
I'm scared

05:32:47.480 --> 05:32:49.480
I can hear the horse going

05:32:49.480 --> 05:32:51.480
Please

05:32:51.480 --> 05:32:53.480
Please

05:32:53.480 --> 05:32:55.480
Please leave me alone

05:32:55.480 --> 05:32:57.480
Leave me alone

05:32:57.480 --> 05:32:59.480
Leave me alone

05:32:59.480 --> 05:33:01.480
Okay, I think I'm safe from the horse

05:33:01.480 --> 05:33:03.480
At least

05:33:03.480 --> 05:33:05.480
Come here

05:33:05.480 --> 05:33:07.480
Come Heather

05:33:07.480 --> 05:33:09.480
Move on

05:33:15.480 --> 05:33:17.480
Oh

05:33:19.480 --> 05:33:21.480
That's awful

05:33:27.480 --> 05:33:29.480
Where'd I go?

05:33:29.480 --> 05:33:31.480
The green on the map

05:33:31.480 --> 05:33:33.480
I can't remember the section very well

05:33:35.480 --> 05:33:37.480
I think I can run

05:33:39.480 --> 05:33:41.480
If we do not stop

05:33:41.480 --> 05:33:43.480
Lavofi

05:33:43.480 --> 05:33:45.480
No

05:33:45.480 --> 05:33:47.480
To 100%

05:33:47.480 --> 05:33:49.480
You're not to swim

05:33:49.480 --> 05:33:51.480
No, don't pick

05:33:51.480 --> 05:33:53.480
Jesus

05:33:53.480 --> 05:33:55.480
Goodness

05:33:55.480 --> 05:33:57.480
Gravy

05:33:57.480 --> 05:33:59.480
Oh my god, I'm taking the long way

05:33:59.480 --> 05:34:01.480
Around

05:34:01.480 --> 05:34:03.480
Panic

05:34:05.480 --> 05:34:07.480
What are you doing

05:34:07.480 --> 05:34:09.480
Why would you randomly grab

05:34:09.480 --> 05:34:11.480
That poor man's horse

05:34:11.480 --> 05:34:13.480
Climb the wall

05:34:13.480 --> 05:34:15.480
And steal

05:34:15.480 --> 05:34:17.480
Please, that's a tamed machine

05:34:17.480 --> 05:34:19.480
They stress me out so much

05:34:19.480 --> 05:34:21.480
Please, I just want 100%

05:34:21.480 --> 05:34:23.480
So I never have to do it again

05:34:23.480 --> 05:34:25.480
Please, please, please

05:34:25.480 --> 05:34:27.480
Why would you randomly take that poor man's horse

05:34:31.480 --> 05:34:33.480
I get too stressed

05:34:33.480 --> 05:34:35.480
I hate them

05:34:35.480 --> 05:34:37.480
I hate them

05:34:37.480 --> 05:34:39.480
Oh my god

05:34:39.480 --> 05:34:41.480
This is good news

05:34:41.480 --> 05:34:43.480
More than you know

05:34:43.480 --> 05:34:45.480
I am once again in your debt, Ezio

05:34:45.480 --> 05:34:47.480
What debt is that amongst friends

05:34:47.480 --> 05:34:49.480
Trust one another

05:34:49.480 --> 05:34:51.480
Yes

05:34:51.480 --> 05:34:53.480
Thank you for relaying the message to me

05:34:53.480 --> 05:34:55.480
That poor man's horse

05:34:55.480 --> 05:34:57.480
Okay

05:34:57.480 --> 05:34:59.480
Lavofi and Markioville

05:35:01.480 --> 05:35:03.480
Now trust each other

05:35:03.480 --> 05:35:05.480
It seems Jezu Cristo was

05:35:05.480 --> 05:35:07.480
That is erected three days ago

05:35:09.480 --> 05:35:11.480
Ta-da

05:35:11.480 --> 05:35:13.480
Checkpoint reach

05:35:13.480 --> 05:35:15.480
That's not the end

05:35:15.480 --> 05:35:17.480
It is the end of that

05:35:17.480 --> 05:35:19.480
We're just being teased

05:35:19.480 --> 05:35:21.480
Crazy man's

05:35:21.480 --> 05:35:23.480
Steal's horse jumps off and runs up wall

05:35:23.480 --> 05:35:25.480
Literally if you hit

05:35:25.480 --> 05:35:27.480
Like a graphic thing

05:35:27.480 --> 05:35:29.480
Like this at an angle

05:35:29.480 --> 05:35:31.480
Ezio refuses to climb

05:35:31.480 --> 05:35:33.480
In the wall and it gives me a heart attack

05:35:33.480 --> 05:35:35.480
Every time

05:35:37.480 --> 05:35:39.480
Look, our thieves are in the

05:35:39.480 --> 05:35:41.480
Our recruits are in the background

05:35:41.480 --> 05:35:43.480
Look, it's you in the background

05:35:43.480 --> 05:35:45.480
It's you in the cutscene

05:35:45.480 --> 05:35:47.480
Not right now

05:35:47.480 --> 05:35:49.480
I can't see them

05:35:53.480 --> 05:35:55.480
It is pain

05:35:55.480 --> 05:35:57.480
Claudia is going to become an assassin

05:36:01.480 --> 05:36:03.480
We work in the dark

05:36:03.480 --> 05:36:05.480
To serve the light

05:36:05.480 --> 05:36:07.480
Yeah, absolutely

05:36:07.480 --> 05:36:09.480
Cannot say any of those words

05:36:09.480 --> 05:36:11.480
Do not ask me to recite that

05:36:11.480 --> 05:36:13.480
I can say that part

05:36:13.480 --> 05:36:15.480
We're in our training

05:36:15.480 --> 05:36:17.480
Oh my god, look at you all reflames

05:36:17.480 --> 05:36:19.480
There's so many of you

05:36:19.480 --> 05:36:21.480
Like, reflames is my system

05:36:23.480 --> 05:36:25.480
I'm reciting it right now

05:36:31.480 --> 05:36:33.480
I offer the choice to you

05:36:33.480 --> 05:36:35.480
Join us

05:36:35.480 --> 05:36:37.480
Oh my god, they're going to hold hands

05:36:37.480 --> 05:36:39.480
Yay

05:36:39.480 --> 05:36:41.480
She's an assassin

05:36:41.480 --> 05:36:43.480
If you get an assassin, you have to be branded

05:36:43.480 --> 05:36:45.480
On your wedding ringer

05:36:45.480 --> 05:36:47.480
Wedding finger

05:36:47.480 --> 05:36:49.480
Where the ring goes

05:36:51.480 --> 05:36:53.480
Is your sister single?

05:36:53.480 --> 05:36:55.480
Hi, Claudia

05:36:55.480 --> 05:36:59.480
You and I have not seen eye to eye on many issues

05:36:59.480 --> 05:37:03.480
But you are exactly what the order means

05:37:03.480 --> 05:37:05.480
We cannot promote it

05:37:05.480 --> 05:37:07.480
You have led the charge against the Templars

05:37:07.480 --> 05:37:09.480
And rebuilt this brother

05:37:09.480 --> 05:37:11.480
Now we must put Ezio where he belongs

05:37:11.480 --> 05:37:13.480
A refling

05:37:13.480 --> 05:37:15.480
Oh my god, his reflames crowning me

05:37:15.480 --> 05:37:17.480
As their Ushides

05:37:17.480 --> 05:37:19.480
Ezio Auditore da Fivenze

05:37:19.480 --> 05:37:21.480
You will now be known as Il Mentore

05:37:21.480 --> 05:37:23.480
The guardian of our order

05:37:23.480 --> 05:37:25.480
And our secrets

05:37:27.480 --> 05:37:29.480
No, I can't be Kama Oshi

05:37:29.480 --> 05:37:31.480
I don't mind Oshi, but Kama Oshi is impossible

05:37:31.480 --> 05:37:33.480
To live up to, that's not possible

05:37:33.480 --> 05:37:35.480
Remember, nothing is true

05:37:35.480 --> 05:37:37.480
Everything is permanent

05:37:37.480 --> 05:37:41.480
Where other men are limited by morality and law

05:37:41.480 --> 05:37:43.480
Remember, everything is permitted

05:37:43.480 --> 05:37:45.480
Everything is permitted

05:37:47.480 --> 05:37:49.480
It's Ezio before or after, he is after

05:37:49.480 --> 05:37:51.480
Altair is like

05:37:51.480 --> 05:37:53.480
I don't even know what century Altair is

05:37:53.480 --> 05:37:55.480
Why this sudden change of heart?

05:37:55.480 --> 05:37:57.480
I'm a cameo assassin

05:37:57.480 --> 05:37:59.480
I always should buy

05:37:59.480 --> 05:38:01.480
I was the one who brought you to Roma

05:38:01.480 --> 05:38:03.480
And the one who caused the explosion as you fled the Castello

05:38:03.480 --> 05:38:05.480
What?

05:38:05.480 --> 05:38:09.480
The mercenaries who protected you at Il Colosseo were mine as well

05:38:09.480 --> 05:38:11.480
You just did not know it

05:38:11.480 --> 05:38:15.480
Maestro Mattiavelli, Cesare has returned to Roma alone

05:38:15.480 --> 05:38:17.480
He rides for the Castel Sant'Angelo

05:38:17.480 --> 05:38:19.480
Thank you

05:38:19.480 --> 05:38:23.480
The decision is yours, not mine

05:38:23.480 --> 05:38:27.480
Niccolo, you better not stop telling me what you think

05:38:27.480 --> 05:38:31.480
Why else would I seek the opinion of my most trusted advisor?

05:38:31.480 --> 05:38:33.480
Go kill them, Mentore

05:38:33.480 --> 05:38:35.480
Finish what you start

05:38:35.480 --> 05:38:37.480
Good advice

05:38:39.480 --> 05:38:41.480
I'll tell you right about the book about you one day

05:38:41.480 --> 05:38:43.480
If you do

05:38:43.480 --> 05:38:45.480
You might wish you since day one just accept it

05:38:45.480 --> 05:38:47.480
I don't get how

05:38:49.480 --> 05:38:53.480
You tell me you consumed all of these content creators

05:38:53.480 --> 05:38:55.480
And you're like

05:38:55.480 --> 05:38:57.480
Yeah, that one

05:38:57.480 --> 05:38:59.480
Out of them all

05:38:59.480 --> 05:39:01.480
We have finished sequence seven

05:39:01.480 --> 05:39:03.480
There are two more sequences

05:39:03.480 --> 05:39:07.480
And then we've done the campaign

05:39:07.480 --> 05:39:09.480
It's actually finishing a lot earlier than I thought

05:39:09.480 --> 05:39:11.480
I've still got a couple more hours in me

05:39:11.480 --> 05:39:13.480
Okay

05:39:13.480 --> 05:39:15.480
When it clicks it clicks

05:39:15.480 --> 05:39:19.480
You don't pick the Oshi, the Oshi does pick you

05:39:19.480 --> 05:39:21.480
When you know you know

05:39:21.480 --> 05:39:23.480
Wait, the game is really that short

05:39:23.480 --> 05:39:27.480
If you ignore everything and do campaign only

05:39:27.480 --> 05:39:29.480
Send it on the campaign then

05:39:29.480 --> 05:39:31.480
On it's way

05:39:31.480 --> 05:39:35.480
Pretty, you can wrap up

05:39:35.480 --> 05:39:37.480
Real quick

05:39:37.480 --> 05:39:41.480
I am going to destroy another tower

05:39:41.480 --> 05:39:45.480
Because I want to unlock this third signal

05:39:45.480 --> 05:39:47.480
And then we will

05:39:47.480 --> 05:39:49.480
Actually, you know what

05:39:49.480 --> 05:39:53.480
I'm going to send my assassins on a mission

05:39:53.480 --> 05:39:55.480
I'm going to pee and make a cup of tea

05:39:55.480 --> 05:39:57.480
And get some food

05:39:57.480 --> 05:39:59.480
And we can just take a little five minutes to ourselves

05:39:59.480 --> 05:40:01.480
A little tea break

05:40:01.480 --> 05:40:05.480
Let's send some of the wee

05:40:05.480 --> 05:40:07.480
Like everyone for that one mission

05:40:07.480 --> 05:40:11.480
No ideal, but it's fine

05:40:11.480 --> 05:40:13.480
Can you 100% not?

05:40:13.480 --> 05:40:15.480
You can, so that will be a level up

05:40:15.480 --> 05:40:18.480
Right, everyone

05:40:18.480 --> 05:40:20.480
I don't want to be too close to the pigeons

05:40:20.480 --> 05:40:22.480
Because they literally go

05:40:22.480 --> 05:40:24.480
In your ear

05:40:24.480 --> 05:40:26.480
Hopefully that's not too bad

05:40:26.480 --> 05:40:28.480
For ambience

05:40:28.480 --> 05:40:31.480
Everyone, please do consider standing up

05:40:31.480 --> 05:40:34.480
And getting your legs and blood flow going

05:40:34.480 --> 05:40:35.480
Or wiggle your toes

05:40:35.480 --> 05:40:36.480
If you're that lazy

05:40:36.480 --> 05:40:38.480
Stretch your feet and pull them back and forth

05:40:38.480 --> 05:40:41.480
So your muscles and your calves

05:40:41.480 --> 05:40:43.480
Like come back and forth

05:40:43.480 --> 05:40:45.480
Go for a peep, get some water

05:40:45.480 --> 05:40:47.480
Some snacks, some juicy juice

05:40:47.480 --> 05:40:49.480
Hypotenuse

05:40:49.480 --> 05:40:53.480
And I will be back in roughly

05:40:53.480 --> 05:40:55.480
Three minutes

05:40:55.480 --> 05:40:57.480
I'm going to try and heat up ravioli

05:40:57.480 --> 05:41:00.480
Like fast as anything

05:41:00.480 --> 05:41:02.480
So I will be a moment

05:41:02.480 --> 05:41:04.480
I would like to watch Emi while she does ASMR live

05:41:04.480 --> 05:41:06.480
Her link is in my description

05:41:06.480 --> 05:41:08.480
You can do that right now, okay?

05:41:08.480 --> 05:41:10.480
I will do the old pretending to sleep

05:41:10.480 --> 05:41:13.480
And then I'll open up the game again, okay?

05:41:13.480 --> 05:41:15.480
So don't worry

05:41:15.480 --> 05:41:17.480
Don't worry about it

05:41:20.480 --> 05:41:22.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:32.480 --> 05:41:34.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:34.480 --> 05:41:36.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:36.480 --> 05:41:38.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:38.480 --> 05:41:40.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:40.480 --> 05:41:42.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:42.480 --> 05:41:44.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:44.480 --> 05:41:46.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:46.480 --> 05:41:48.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:48.480 --> 05:41:50.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:50.480 --> 05:41:52.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:52.480 --> 05:41:54.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:54.480 --> 05:41:56.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:56.480 --> 05:41:58.480
It caused my eyes

05:41:58.480 --> 05:42:00.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:00.480 --> 05:42:02.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:02.480 --> 05:42:04.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:04.480 --> 05:42:06.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:06.480 --> 05:42:08.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:08.480 --> 05:42:10.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:10.480 --> 05:42:12.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:12.480 --> 05:42:14.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:14.480 --> 05:42:16.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:16.480 --> 05:42:18.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:18.480 --> 05:42:20.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:20.480 --> 05:42:22.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:22.480 --> 05:42:24.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:24.480 --> 05:42:26.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:26.480 --> 05:42:28.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:28.480 --> 05:42:30.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:30.480 --> 05:42:32.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:32.480 --> 05:42:34.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:34.480 --> 05:42:36.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:36.480 --> 05:42:38.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:38.480 --> 05:42:40.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:40.480 --> 05:42:42.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:42.480 --> 05:42:44.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:44.480 --> 05:42:46.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:46.480 --> 05:42:48.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:48.480 --> 05:42:50.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:50.480 --> 05:42:52.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:52.480 --> 05:42:54.480
It caused my eyes

05:42:54.480 --> 05:42:56.480
It caused my eyes

I had no idea I alive eight aid

05:49:22.480 --> 05:49:25.480
Oh we already had endocrine come back as well

05:49:25.480 --> 05:49:35.160
back as well. I've got me, I've got all my food. I have a bowl and it has rice

05:49:35.160 --> 05:49:45.880
pea snacks. It has two stick meat and one egg and two eggs. I'm just gonna send this

05:49:45.880 --> 05:49:52.120
assassin away to get like even more stronger and because we're caned again

05:49:53.040 --> 05:50:07.680
Jesus is there any level 3's? I'm like absolutely feasting. I've got fruit juice

05:50:07.680 --> 05:50:13.600
with me. I've got a bottle of water. I've got cup of tea with honey in it.

05:50:13.680 --> 05:50:21.800
Like, ah, um, oh, not again, would you stop doing that? You're embarrassing me.

05:50:21.800 --> 05:50:30.000
We're driving this controller. Yes, eh, so I'm gonna like munch and play but I

05:50:30.000 --> 05:50:34.040
didn't bring any napkins so I might have to suck the egg out of the bowl which

05:50:34.040 --> 05:50:45.080
sounds bizarre but can you say the second drink again? The fruit juice? It's like, it's

05:50:45.080 --> 05:50:55.640
got mango in it. It's like super healthy juice. And a cup of tea. Wait, you can't, what?

05:50:55.640 --> 05:51:02.680
Bottle of water. Oh, bottle of water. I didn't say it like the British say it. Well, I consider

05:51:02.720 --> 05:51:07.360
the British, English, and the memes like kind of about the English say the bottle of water.

05:51:07.360 --> 05:51:12.560
I don't know if I need to slurp this egg because I really can't be bothered getting,

05:51:12.560 --> 05:51:20.880
where am I supposed to be going? How far away is this location? Oh, it's the castle,

05:51:20.880 --> 05:51:29.760
right. I'm gonna try, I'm gonna get rid of this. Oh, says he's a coward though. It's really annoying

05:51:29.800 --> 05:51:37.760
trying to get keywords because they actually run away. Actually, give me one second, my room is

05:51:37.760 --> 05:51:57.400
on fire because of this PC. Oh, it's been robbed! I look away for five seconds and it's been robbed!

05:51:57.920 --> 05:52:03.160
Oh, right, I don't need the money that much. It's fine, it's fine, great. Let me put my head

05:52:03.160 --> 05:52:07.320
down because I actually can't hear the game right now. Did he just run up to me and like,

05:52:07.320 --> 05:52:21.520
rob me? Right. Not seeing my room's hope, but too hope it's just came in through a ring in it.

05:52:21.520 --> 05:52:27.120
Honestly, I'm sweltering. I don't know if that's the Scottish word, sweltering. Do you see that?

05:52:27.120 --> 05:52:36.760
I'm sweltering. Sweating my beats off. Although I feel like sweating my beats off probably comes

05:52:36.760 --> 05:52:45.680
from like, is it Mardi Gras? Like that party that Americans have where you unveil yourself and you

05:52:45.680 --> 05:52:50.160
get beats as a reward? Like, I think that's where that saying might have came from because that just

05:52:50.160 --> 05:52:55.440
makes sense. Like, oh, I'm sweating my beats off because I'm like showing the goods so much and so

05:52:55.520 --> 05:53:06.880
often. Right, where on earth has this captain? I really don't want to mess it up because if you

05:53:06.880 --> 05:53:15.280
mess it up and he runs away in time, you have to wait until the following day. Oh, I think I know

05:53:15.280 --> 05:53:21.120
who this one is. I think he, oh, oh, oh, hold on, hold on, hold on. No, see, oh, you know the guy

05:53:21.200 --> 05:53:27.680
that can see you right now? I could actually, wait, I can't lock onto him, but he can lock onto me.

05:53:27.680 --> 05:53:39.760
See you stinky AI. Perish. Oh, beats of sweat that come off your head. Oh, you know what? Yeah,

05:53:39.760 --> 05:53:45.840
now that you've said that, that makes more sense. Yeah, probably not Mardi Gras really is. Okay,

05:53:46.560 --> 05:53:50.720
where's, yes, I knew it was this one.

05:53:53.520 --> 05:54:03.040
Do we assassinate him from above is my question? I don't know. I normally have three signals at

05:54:03.040 --> 05:54:08.560
this point, which means I can do a raining down effect. Did he really say where did I go?

05:54:09.280 --> 05:54:18.080
Great. Right, if I can ear assassinate him, this isn't a problem. If I can lock onto him,

05:54:18.080 --> 05:54:28.960
I am very tall up to lock onto him though. No, wait, no, wait, lock onto him. Yeah? Uh-huh.

05:54:29.920 --> 05:54:41.120
No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, that was so good. Oh, and none of the guards want to defend. That's

05:54:41.120 --> 05:54:49.840
hilarious. All the guards are like, that, that man just came out of the sky. We are not, we are

05:54:49.920 --> 05:54:57.920
retreating right now. Does your room have per ventilation? That's horrendous ventilation.

05:55:00.880 --> 05:55:07.840
Unfortunately, I'm renting. So I have like absolutely no input or like anything I could

05:55:07.840 --> 05:55:20.400
really do about it. Rip in pepperoni. He craves the drop. Okay, I shouldn't get too distracted

05:55:20.400 --> 05:55:28.880
because my tea's gonna get too cold and my fruit juice is gonna get too warm. I am going to ignite

05:55:28.880 --> 05:55:40.480
the, gonna light this place up and then we're gone. Oh, you're edging me and not the good kind.

05:55:44.160 --> 05:55:47.280
Are the windows open? No, the window's freaking broken.

05:55:50.080 --> 05:55:54.720
Like the landlord has been really nice to me and he's like left me alone. It's not like one of

05:55:54.720 --> 05:56:00.560
them annoying landlords that are like trying to like trail through your place all the time. But

05:56:01.760 --> 05:56:08.240
obviously whenever you visit somewhere to rent and you like inspect it, you don't actually know

05:56:08.240 --> 05:56:15.120
what's wrong with the place until you move in and like they're obviously, I discovered like

05:56:15.120 --> 05:56:23.680
windows are broken, the hot and like cold, I don't know what the word is, is not like ideal.

05:56:23.680 --> 05:56:29.520
Are you guys okay if I hide in this table whilst I drink my, oh, I forgot to shake my fruit juice.

05:56:29.520 --> 05:56:35.360
Whoops, that's like real one of having fruit juice. I might just drink it real quick. I apologize.

05:56:43.680 --> 05:56:53.280
Oh, that shit's so good. It's apple banana, lychee mango juice smoothing. So I'm getting all my

05:56:53.280 --> 05:56:59.280
fruit in one drink because I don't really, I don't really eat fruit that often. I like

05:56:59.280 --> 05:57:03.760
waste fruit, so I feel bad. Oh my god, it's mimosa, mimosa spotted.

05:57:12.800 --> 05:57:16.320
Guys, you'll never guess who I arranged an ace marco club with this morning.

05:57:17.040 --> 05:57:19.040
They've just showed up in chat.

05:57:24.640 --> 05:57:32.640
It's very likely. That'll be my first official club with a VTuber. I've got DEMP on the list.

05:57:33.360 --> 05:57:39.840
I'm hunting down everyone with 3DS. I'm serious about that goal. I'm arranging them all. We'll

05:57:39.840 --> 05:57:45.200
make it nice and easy. Gonna be doing my best. So hopefully you guys eat good and you can sleep

05:57:45.200 --> 05:57:54.400
to my soothing Scottish accent. That's right, wee laddie. Time to go to sleep. Are you tingling,

05:57:54.400 --> 05:58:02.480
tingle, tingle, tingle. Oh my god, she must be so cool to be able to collab with you.

05:58:02.800 --> 05:58:11.120
I should actually do like 4 Scots accent on an ace marco club. That would be hilarious.

05:58:14.000 --> 05:58:16.240
I've almost finished my Juicy Just hypotenuse.

05:58:19.600 --> 05:58:22.080
What should I eat first? Should I eat an egg? I think so.

05:58:24.160 --> 05:58:26.640
I don't really like the idea of eggs sitting out too long.

05:58:27.600 --> 05:58:36.400
To say something was delicious in Scots, you say it was braw and that was braw. That drink was

05:58:36.400 --> 05:58:44.720
delicious. You keep mocking your accent. Oh, I don't think people find the Scottish accent

05:58:44.720 --> 05:58:51.520
hot. I would say like hot accents like unironically like French Italian or normally like rated quite

05:58:51.520 --> 05:58:57.200
highly. I have taken a bite of a meat stick. I apologize for anyone who doesn't like eating.

05:58:58.240 --> 05:59:06.640
I need to eat. I want you to read Go The F to sleep in your accent. That'd be good.

05:59:06.800 --> 05:59:12.160
Is Valley Girl scrawny real?

05:59:13.120 --> 05:59:24.400
Hi guys. I'm so totally excited to be here. Yeah, I'm Valley Girl. I laugh at everything.

05:59:25.920 --> 05:59:32.400
Yeah, that's the best you can. Yeah, you like that? Is that what you want? I'm scared.

05:59:32.400 --> 05:59:42.080
I want to perish. Valley Girl scrawny. Say in it, brav. Can you do a Scottish Valley Girl?

05:59:46.000 --> 05:59:47.520
No, I don't think so.

05:59:50.720 --> 05:59:58.400
No, I don't think so. I didn't think so. No, my brain is like unable to compute what I need to do in

05:59:58.400 --> 06:00:08.560
order to keep the accent, but make it different. Brain kind of. You're not hypnotizing us. Scottish

06:00:08.560 --> 06:00:15.600
accents are hot. I'm eating the meat. I'm now baiting the egg. I'm just going to touch it.

06:00:15.600 --> 06:00:28.720
I just said fucking delicious. I have earned, oh my god, a bite of the egg and the meat at the same

06:00:28.720 --> 06:00:40.800
time. I have earned this, okay? I have earned this. As I almost choke on it, hey ho, there's a first

06:00:40.800 --> 06:00:48.640
time for everything. It's like a pepper ramy if you're a British. I don't know what the equivalent

06:00:48.640 --> 06:00:56.080
is in America or it's a twizy stick in Australia. Xio is literally, he's like, I need to rest. I've

06:00:56.080 --> 06:01:08.080
been at this for hours. He's sleeping in the hay. Oh, my mouth opens when my mouth...

06:01:11.040 --> 06:01:12.800
Ah, that's cool.

06:01:16.800 --> 06:01:23.600
Like my mouth is closed right now, but because my mouth opens, well, yeah.

06:01:30.000 --> 06:01:32.080
A slim gym, probably.

06:01:41.520 --> 06:01:50.080
Would you like some sweet chili pea snack that's been baked?

06:02:06.160 --> 06:02:08.080
Okay, open up.

06:02:11.040 --> 06:02:20.160
Mm-hmm. I hope you guys stretched, because if you haven't stretched, that's you sat for six hours

06:02:20.160 --> 06:02:26.080
and you're supposed to stretch. If anyone's in a wheelchair, you're exempt from these instructions.

06:02:26.880 --> 06:02:31.360
Mm-hmm.

06:02:37.200 --> 06:02:39.360
I stretched and all my limbs dislocated.

06:02:42.400 --> 06:02:46.080
You're not going to fall for that one stare? Well, you're going to split, aren't you?

06:02:46.400 --> 06:02:47.520
Ah, the stare.

06:02:49.920 --> 06:02:52.880
Oh, my God. I don't know if I can read that out.

06:02:55.440 --> 06:02:56.960
When is booty inspection day?

06:03:01.280 --> 06:03:04.320
A faint sound of munching emanates from the car.

06:03:04.480 --> 06:03:16.720
I've got sweet chili pea snacks that are baked. Two meat sticks and two eggs,

06:03:16.720 --> 06:03:20.080
and I've got one meat and egg left, and I'm just munching on the peas.

06:03:25.520 --> 06:03:30.880
Oh, my God. So for years, I had no idea what Charlie horse meant.

06:03:35.200 --> 06:03:42.560
It's just called the pulled muscle, and I was like, what on earth is a Charlie horse?

06:03:43.280 --> 06:03:48.960
Like, is this a famous horse named Charlie? Why is it happening to people? That's not possible.

06:03:49.760 --> 06:03:54.880
I was like, it's crazy. And then I finally figured it out because I watched like a meme,

06:03:54.880 --> 06:03:59.600
and the guy like fell over, and he was like, oh, oh, Charlie horse.

06:04:00.400 --> 06:04:04.320
And like, because of his body language, my brain was like, oh, my God,

06:04:04.320 --> 06:04:09.360
he's having a muscle spasm. That's what it means. Like,

06:04:11.440 --> 06:04:16.240
oh, I need a burp. I'm so sorry. I'm eating, so it means I burp a lot. I'm jammy, if you don't like it.

06:04:21.040 --> 06:04:27.920
I don't think a zero or mercy burp. I think they have manners and weren't raised in a barn like me.

06:04:29.760 --> 06:04:38.400
I was named after Sir Charles of Horse.

06:04:41.680 --> 06:04:44.960
Ooh, money. We've got 3,000 in the bank right now.

06:04:47.280 --> 06:04:49.840
Some say that Charlie's still in pain to this day.

06:04:50.880 --> 06:04:56.560
Was that a meme on Family Guy? I don't know what it was. No, those ones are the different ones.

06:04:56.560 --> 06:05:00.800
I learned from Mercy the other day that saying be there, be square is because you won't be around.

06:05:02.960 --> 06:05:08.800
Wait, what? Be there or be square is because you won't be around.

06:05:11.760 --> 06:05:22.560
Oh, that's so smart. Like around in a circle. Yeah. And like, you won't be around in the area

06:05:22.560 --> 06:05:29.440
if you're not there because you're a square. Yeah. Oh, I just got that too. That's good. I like that.

06:05:29.440 --> 06:05:35.200
Mercy smart. Shawnee, it's not manners. It's your cuttlebone. You're just into buoyancy. Yes,

06:05:35.200 --> 06:05:38.480
this is my first time on land. Sometimes.

06:05:38.480 --> 06:05:50.720
I'm careful. You don't want to make me too smart. I'll start coming up with new names.

06:05:50.720 --> 06:05:55.200
Fond de la Bism. I'm never going to live down Fond de la Bism and be sucky.

06:05:58.480 --> 06:06:02.880
What marshmallow did you want to see Anthony specific? Oh, I didn't open up the marshmallows.

06:06:02.880 --> 06:06:06.640
Well, we do it at the end of stream because we're actually really close to finishing the game.

06:06:06.640 --> 06:06:09.760
Like, we're really close to finishing the game.

06:06:16.720 --> 06:06:19.760
Alright, you better be scared of me cooking again.

06:06:37.120 --> 06:06:43.920
I'm sorry, but I'm going to suck my fingers. I know some people don't like it

06:06:43.920 --> 06:06:59.760
matter-wise, but I don't have a napkin. That remains me. I need to make the audio.

06:06:59.760 --> 06:07:04.480
Okay. I inhaled the meat and the egg and then I finished my tea and then we're going to get

06:07:04.480 --> 06:07:20.400
straight back and finish the stuff. I need like more charcuterie snack stuff for longer streams

06:07:21.280 --> 06:07:23.120
because I don't have time to actually make food.

06:07:23.280 --> 06:07:34.720
Maybe a cold pasta dish? I can pre-make.

06:07:36.640 --> 06:07:40.640
The crunchy thing is the meat stick. It's got like a skin on it.

06:07:44.000 --> 06:07:44.640
That's the meat.

06:07:53.280 --> 06:08:00.320
I've got protein from the egg and protein from the meat and fats.

06:08:01.600 --> 06:08:04.160
And the pea snacks are carbohydrates.

06:08:12.320 --> 06:08:14.880
Yum yum yum. I'm going to get tons of hydration.

06:08:17.280 --> 06:08:22.640
That's way too crunchy to be. It is meat. It is meat. I promise you it's meat.

06:08:22.640 --> 06:08:25.040
It's like an outer skin, like a pepper ramy.

06:08:30.640 --> 06:08:35.840
Okay, all the food is finished. I'm now for the tea.

06:08:41.200 --> 06:08:48.400
Honestly, depending on how fast we go, we might actually finish the campaign in less than two

06:08:49.200 --> 06:08:52.640
hours, but I'm quite happy to like fart about and do the Borgia Towers after.

06:08:52.640 --> 06:08:57.920
Maybe like so we can like streamline tomorrow for doing the DNA sequence run.

06:09:07.680 --> 06:09:09.440
I'm gonna let a big burp. I'm sorry.

06:09:12.560 --> 06:09:17.200
That was good. Such good food. I really needed that and I hit the spot.

06:09:19.360 --> 06:09:24.000
Mmm, a battered Mars four hand counts room. It's a honey tea.

06:09:25.840 --> 06:09:33.600
Sorry, it all comes back up. I was going to record is tomorrow like your girlfriend for like

06:09:33.600 --> 06:09:37.360
forgets to turn off the make. So it's just me munching and crunching because some people

06:09:37.360 --> 06:09:44.000
like really enjoy like other people's like munching sounds. I'm like, if you are telling me that I can

06:09:44.080 --> 06:09:51.680
order McDonald's and eat it on the mic and people would like be happy with that.

06:09:51.680 --> 06:09:53.920
Like, uh, you don't got to tell me twice.

06:09:56.640 --> 06:09:59.360
Shawnee, if you're looking for a snack that's easy to prepare, great.

06:10:00.400 --> 06:10:07.360
I can't believe it. I can't believe you're telling me to eat healthy and look after myself.

06:10:08.000 --> 06:10:20.320
Oh, cruel. Honey tea. You boil those per beat. No, I love to be. I get to buy my honey from like,

06:10:21.840 --> 06:10:24.880
I like smaller shop and I like supporting them on their own.

06:10:26.640 --> 06:10:33.840
I sip my tea. Oh, yeah. That's roasting. It's still quite warm. Not gonna lie. I thought it was

06:10:33.840 --> 06:10:42.720
gonna cool. Be a bit cooler. I'm okay. I'm okay though. Right, we're gonna go and get our

06:10:42.720 --> 06:10:54.800
wanted taken off of us. Put that on the Herald. Thank you very much. You're about to stand in

06:10:54.800 --> 06:11:05.920
some serious matter. Chicken nuggies ASMR. There's eating 100 chicken nuggets. Still a challenge.

06:11:07.520 --> 06:11:12.560
I feel like you starve me and I could probably do that like in one go.

06:11:16.240 --> 06:11:21.920
Have I bought this bank over here? I haven't. Investments, people. Investments.

06:11:22.000 --> 06:11:29.840
That reminds me several years ago back when Tumblr was an important platform that some vegans

06:11:29.840 --> 06:11:38.640
actually thought bees were physical harm for their honey. Oh, vegans just doing their thing.

06:11:38.640 --> 06:11:49.680
They're nice, I guess. I just, yeah, vegans are vegans. I completely understand like the stands

06:11:50.000 --> 06:11:54.960
no one actually wants any animals to be hurt or all that jazz. I just, you know,

06:11:56.240 --> 06:12:01.840
I ask have you ever seen a healthy looking vegan when they're like I've been vegan for five years?

06:12:02.480 --> 06:12:09.280
They look ill. I had a close family member that was temporarily vegan for a couple of years

06:12:10.000 --> 06:12:17.440
and when they finally started to eat meat again, they were like healthy overnight. I'm so sorry.

06:12:17.440 --> 06:12:20.880
I apologize if anyone is a vegan here but please seriously take your supplements,

06:12:21.600 --> 06:12:27.360
look at what you need to in order to get what you need because please be careful. It's very

06:12:27.360 --> 06:12:33.760
dangerous. I don't, I'm actually being serious for like for one millisecond. It is incredibly

06:12:33.760 --> 06:12:38.880
dangerous to genuinely choose to be a vegan and a lot of people don't realize until it's too late

06:12:39.120 --> 06:12:50.960
that like you are, like if you really want to get into it, like there's the caveman times before

06:12:50.960 --> 06:12:56.560
we discovered what cooking, what cooked meat could do for us and like it's like, you know,

06:12:56.560 --> 06:13:02.640
once humans had access to cooked meat, the brain power of humans like went up. I can't

06:13:02.640 --> 06:13:06.640
remember what all like the details and what it's called and all that but like this is what I've

06:13:06.640 --> 06:13:10.400
been taught and like I genuinely believe it. I'm sorry but if you've ever looked at a vegan,

06:13:10.400 --> 06:13:16.080
they just look like a husk of a human and I'm so sorry if it's offensive but like it's just my

06:13:16.080 --> 06:13:19.440
opinion but I never said I was smart and my opinions don't reflect the agency. I'm sorry,

06:13:19.440 --> 06:13:26.400
love you, bye. I'll stop talking. I'll stop talking. Okay, this border district, you have

06:13:26.400 --> 06:13:33.760
to scale it from the rooftops. It is impossible. You have to do it via arrow storm. If you do not

06:13:33.760 --> 06:13:40.880
do it via arrow storm, you're just like hurting yourself like it's so bad and you can get a

06:13:40.880 --> 06:13:47.920
flag on the way so so literally drop down arrow storm instantly and just like that done.

06:13:49.280 --> 06:13:54.240
Easiest, literally you don't even annoy any other guards that are in the vicinity. There is no one

06:13:54.240 --> 06:14:02.960
on the rooftops as long as you have arrow storm unlocked which is what the um which is what the

06:14:02.960 --> 06:14:07.600
three recruits so you need six previous Borja towers destroyed in order to get that but once

06:14:07.600 --> 06:14:16.240
you've got it then you are you're smooth sailing through the game. If only Leafs had protein. Yes,

06:14:16.240 --> 06:14:23.600
I know deeper green coloured vegetaibals are like really really good in general um what way

06:14:23.600 --> 06:14:29.280
am I to go? That looks too big for me to yeah I don't have a glove yet. Okay this looks like the

06:14:29.280 --> 06:14:40.240
way I need to go. Did anyone get their what is it what's that organ that blows up that was used

06:14:40.240 --> 06:14:45.760
for grass eating? Like it literally kills you. I'll always forget the name of it. An appendix?

06:14:45.760 --> 06:14:53.360
Did anyone get their appendixes removed? Did you get wrecked with your appendix?

06:14:53.360 --> 06:15:02.960
Okay tea time. Rice and beans. I can cover you for the most. Yeah.

06:15:07.280 --> 06:15:15.680
Yours burst? Oh you must have been deathly ill. If it bursts it can result in death

06:15:16.480 --> 06:15:22.160
because it's just straight poison to your organs. Holy crap someone said my tonsils

06:15:22.720 --> 06:15:34.000
they stole your tonsils. Give them back. I thought appendixes were for built. I thought appendix was

06:15:34.000 --> 06:15:39.680
for when we used to eat like grass grass like back in the old day. I'm taking a sip of tea I'm gonna

06:15:39.680 --> 06:15:48.320
try and finish out my my apologies. I hear gallbladder I'm scared my mum had a gallbladder issue

06:15:48.320 --> 06:15:55.040
and so did my gran genetically I am predispositioned. Like one day on stream I'm just gonna start like

06:15:55.040 --> 06:16:03.520
screaming and being like gallbladder gallbladder but uh hopefully that doesn't actually happen

06:16:03.520 --> 06:16:05.680
but I can't say I'm the healthiest being around.

06:16:08.800 --> 06:16:12.720
You can die of death did I say that? Yeah you can die of death.

06:16:13.040 --> 06:16:24.000
I don't wish that pain. Wait you know how you know how you guys are guys? Um have you guys

06:16:24.880 --> 06:16:31.520
ever passed the kidney stone? For anyone who drinks an energy drink have you passed the kidney

06:16:31.520 --> 06:16:40.080
stone yes or no? I'm very interested in that I wanna know. Never maybe? Did you ever really

06:16:40.080 --> 06:16:46.160
sort of pee pee at one time? We are not 100% what it is used for. These range from filtration

06:16:46.160 --> 06:16:52.240
to breaking down fiber to appendix to a mystery organ. That's so cool. Like how do we not know?

06:16:52.240 --> 06:16:59.280
We've got so much history. No. I hope I don't yeah it sucks. Oh.

06:17:03.360 --> 06:17:08.240
I've heard stories from women that are like I've had a kidney stone and I've had a baby I'd rather

06:17:08.240 --> 06:17:15.120
you know do the baby again and I'm like I see that's biology in play. Did you know

06:17:16.080 --> 06:17:23.120
the brain actually tells women that their birth of their... Wait where the heck am I going?

06:17:24.080 --> 06:17:28.720
Can I climb up here without the glove? I don't think I can climb up here without the

06:17:28.800 --> 06:17:34.400
glove. Playing? No? Okay I can. I can. Jesus. I was like oh I've just missed out.

06:17:35.520 --> 06:17:41.760
I love stronticolors and I heard her kidney stone perils. Oh my god. I do have peril. I have a

06:17:41.760 --> 06:17:47.840
peril in a very special location. Hmm are you doing mersey? Are you streaming later?

06:17:48.480 --> 06:17:55.360
Are you streaming and one hour, two hour, three hour mersey stream? Question mark.

06:17:58.160 --> 06:17:59.920
I'm finishing my tea please pardon me.

06:18:07.040 --> 06:18:08.720
I need a burp it's like stuck in my throat.

06:18:14.480 --> 06:18:15.680
I have finished my tea.

06:18:18.800 --> 06:18:22.880
Requiem. Requiem is the debate. Okay.

06:18:30.160 --> 06:18:35.440
Is Azura... Is Mama Azu streaming the day? Wait where the heck am I to go?

06:18:37.040 --> 06:18:40.560
Sounds like I need to go up here. Oh that's because I do need to go up here.

06:18:40.640 --> 06:18:55.680
Only energy drink I've had is Calcius. Calessus? What? C-E-L. Calcius. Oh I got there in the end.

06:18:56.640 --> 06:19:02.000
I got there in the end. You just gotta let me cook on some words okay? Some words are like huh?

06:19:02.960 --> 06:19:10.480
Huh? And then you just gotta phonetically spell them out. Everyone is streaming right now aren't

06:19:10.480 --> 06:19:17.360
oh my god overlapping corp I can't believe it. I literally tell everyone like go watch everyone

06:19:17.360 --> 06:19:21.200
else's stream because I'm literally just sitting doing like an endurance eight hour stream type

06:19:21.200 --> 06:19:27.840
thing. I'm just having a blast. But don't worry when you go live in Mersey I always recommend to

06:19:27.840 --> 06:19:37.040
the girls please to go... No I always recommend to the brief links to give you a chance and check

06:19:37.040 --> 06:19:43.200
you out. See we work because odds are I'm still gonna be streaming by the time you... Oh I wasn't

06:19:43.200 --> 06:19:50.960
supposed to be discovered. Oh well so we over... It's fine we're doing it to... Look at that. Look at

06:19:50.960 --> 06:19:59.840
that combat cam. Is that Azura live right now with that link? Or is that Imi? Or is that just

06:19:59.840 --> 06:20:05.360
everyone's link all together? Silence discord mode. Oh you're not discord mode at all. YouTube mode.

06:20:05.360 --> 06:20:09.200
I'm just kidding thank you for moderating for free I really appreciate it. Actually all the girls

06:20:09.200 --> 06:20:15.440
really do appreciate it because it's kind of like one of those like jobs you know like the

06:20:15.440 --> 06:20:20.480
silent unrecognized work but I actually genuinely like thank you to everyone who like applied to be

06:20:20.480 --> 06:20:25.040
a mod and like thank you for everyone just being like cool at the mods and all that shiz.

06:20:27.040 --> 06:20:34.000
Really appreciate that. But then again, silence mutual. With all that said and all due respect.

06:20:36.160 --> 06:20:42.080
Oh I'm just getting spotted by everyone right Azura. We're just in a big fight. Oh no they have guns.

06:20:44.080 --> 06:20:49.360
Calling the assassins. Calling the assassins. Okay I'm not dealing with them all you can kill them all.

06:20:51.440 --> 06:20:58.480
I'm not dealing with them. Whoa they literally... Is he going to see me enter in the castle? I think

06:20:58.480 --> 06:21:04.160
he might. I simply have all say you tell the girls to watch the girls. No I said it wrong.

06:21:04.160 --> 06:21:11.680
I said it wrong. They do it for free. I mean literally Azura and Imi are Azura's online as well.

06:21:11.680 --> 06:21:19.280
Oh if there are any Azura delay she is officially online as well if you're an Azura delay watcher.

06:21:19.280 --> 06:21:24.240
I ordered a fresh batch of la cadore la last night. I'm just going to go and get you out of here.

06:21:24.240 --> 06:21:30.880
But the pope has taken it all. Where is the pope? He meets with Cesare. Strange. He did not tell me Cesare

06:21:30.880 --> 06:21:40.240
had returned. Imagine being a Mortarator. Imagine... Okay now what? Sorry I'm starting to lose that

06:21:40.240 --> 06:21:46.160
little bit. I was like imagine being a Mortarator. Okay now what happens? Danny did anything else.

06:21:46.240 --> 06:21:49.520
I'm imagining. With my mind only I'm imagining.

06:21:52.320 --> 06:21:54.640
Okay I'm getting a bit delirious. I think it's like...

06:21:56.240 --> 06:22:00.720
Bro I know I said this like yesterday. We were so delirious during that group collab.

06:22:00.720 --> 06:22:06.640
But I'm so excited for our official like group game collab together. I hope you guys like the intro.

06:22:06.640 --> 06:22:14.640
I'm gonna script it when we start up the streams. And literally everyone's gonna be streaming it.

06:22:16.560 --> 06:22:19.120
So you can see all six POVs at once.

06:22:22.640 --> 06:22:29.040
Oh I'm burping away. You've been at this for six hours? Honestly.

06:22:33.840 --> 06:22:40.080
You come here so I can assassinate you. That's right come closer. I can sense thine penis.

06:22:40.640 --> 06:22:42.800
Okay sorry I shouldn't have said that. I like that.

06:22:45.280 --> 06:22:50.000
I ain't gonna actually do this. I'm starting to lose a little bit. But hey hope. Such a sleep.

06:22:51.600 --> 06:22:59.440
Let's go. Oh I don't know why I said that. I'm remembering just like. Oh I'm notorious.

06:23:00.800 --> 06:23:09.120
I didn't lure my notarite. Oh it sucks. I almost got caught. Well actually it doesn't matter if I

06:23:09.120 --> 06:23:16.480
get caught by him. He doesn't come. How do you not see me? I'm literally on a bookcase.

06:23:18.960 --> 06:23:24.480
Okay so. God he's so armored out the woods.

06:23:26.880 --> 06:23:31.200
I have something on my mind. Like all I'm saying is that the marshmallows have been having a good

06:23:31.280 --> 06:23:36.240
time on the marshmallows. Oh whoops I wasn't supposed to jump down here.

06:23:43.760 --> 06:23:47.680
Oh I'm getting in trouble. I don't remember all these enemies being here. I'm gonna have

06:23:47.680 --> 06:23:54.160
to remember like when I'm doing the like do not be detected. Like you put that away.

06:23:54.400 --> 06:23:58.320
I literally did lead and I shot first get wrecked.

06:24:00.160 --> 06:24:04.560
There's Tony big enough for the both of us. Cowboy. Oh I got 6000.

06:24:06.080 --> 06:24:11.360
We're getting so near the end of the game. What has happened here? I do not know what you mean.

06:24:11.360 --> 06:24:17.360
I want to take. I take. If I want you to die.

06:24:35.360 --> 06:24:36.160
That's his dad.

06:24:41.840 --> 06:24:48.240
What reason could I possibly have to kill him? Was he plotting against me with my brilliant

06:24:48.240 --> 06:24:55.280
treacherous captain general? I do not have to stand for this. The assassins murdered him.

06:24:55.280 --> 06:25:02.000
Why did you not stop them? As if I could. It was not my decision to attack Monteriggione.

06:25:02.000 --> 06:25:09.520
It was yours. It is high time you took responsibilities for your actions.

06:25:09.520 --> 06:25:15.440
My accomplishments. Despite the constant interference of failures like you.

06:25:17.360 --> 06:25:22.320
You are not going anywhere. I have the peace. Out of my way old man.

06:25:24.000 --> 06:25:31.840
Get out of my way old man. I gave you everything and yet it's never enough.

06:25:31.920 --> 06:25:34.160
Chesere the intent to poison you.

06:25:40.880 --> 06:25:50.880
You will not listen to reason. Father do you not see. I can kill all of this.

06:25:51.840 --> 06:26:05.840
If I want to leave. I live. If I want to take. I take. And if I want you to die. You die.

06:26:06.880 --> 06:26:13.840
I'm so good. It's so good. Where is the peace of Eden? Stop. I know where it is.

06:26:14.400 --> 06:26:20.320
And you did not tell me he had taken it. Chesere. It's me. It's me. Your queen.

06:26:22.320 --> 06:26:29.680
You are my sister. None more. Where is it? You never loved me. You never loved me.

06:26:30.640 --> 06:26:36.640
Where is the apple? Tell me. Tell me.

06:26:37.440 --> 06:26:43.680
Oh. Voice acting so good. Tell me. Tell me.

06:26:47.520 --> 06:26:54.880
Oh. It's just so good. It's just so good. Thank you for letting me freaking share this game with you.

06:26:54.880 --> 06:27:02.080
Fun fact. You actually don't need to like hurt any. Oh no. No. Go over it. Oh. It's it. Oh you're

06:27:02.080 --> 06:27:10.800
giving me a heart attack. It's the oh. It's the oh. Little sister. I owe. I owe. I owe.

06:27:12.080 --> 06:27:17.440
Fucking all of us have no heart. It's like. Do you see that? They're related. Yeah. It's based on

06:27:17.440 --> 06:27:27.040
history. I could see. I know where that bastard is going. I know where that bastard is going.

06:27:28.000 --> 06:27:36.000
San Pietro. The pavilion in the courtyard. The pavilion in the courtyard. Hmm.

06:27:40.320 --> 06:27:45.680
Exit through the front gate. Wait. Am I still going to get attacked by guards? Oh. Oh. Wrong way.

06:27:45.680 --> 06:27:55.040
Oopsies. You've just got such a big palace. I'll come back for you later. See you later.

06:27:55.200 --> 06:27:57.040
I like this.

06:27:59.360 --> 06:28:00.160
Asasino.

06:28:04.800 --> 06:28:11.040
I will come for you. Later. Later. Come for you later.

06:28:15.280 --> 06:28:16.400
I just like doing that.

06:28:16.400 --> 06:28:27.280
I'll come back for you later. Later. I'll come back for you later. Yes, I will.

06:28:27.840 --> 06:28:33.440
Who's a good refling? Have you been a good boy? Is it time for your daily milky-wilky?

06:28:37.520 --> 06:28:44.480
Oopsies. Oopsies. Oopsies. Wait. He was in my way. Am I supposed to just ignore him? I think I am.

06:28:44.480 --> 06:28:51.680
I will remember that for when we redo the mission. Spiral scape. Right. So that you can grab this box

06:28:51.680 --> 06:29:00.160
because the timer don't start until now. You have to leg it for this entire next section. Okay.

06:29:01.440 --> 06:29:08.560
You have to do it for the entire next day. Fucking let's go. Well, you're stuck in the cut scene.

06:29:08.640 --> 06:29:12.640
Give it a second. Let it cook. Let it cook. Let's go.

06:29:20.320 --> 06:29:23.040
Don't worry. Leave a faith. Leave a faith. Don't worry. Don't worry. Leave a faith.

06:29:23.040 --> 06:29:27.360
Promise. Promise. Ta-da. See? It's right there. And then if you go in the street of the pavilion,

06:29:27.360 --> 06:29:32.400
it's the easiest way to navigate to the place. Okay. And then you need to do the jump thing. Jump.

06:29:32.400 --> 06:29:37.520
And then just take the main street all the way up to the pavilion and just jump every time you

06:29:37.520 --> 06:29:43.280
see an agility at the bottom of your screen. You just jump and they can't get you. Jump. See?

06:29:43.920 --> 06:29:55.760
The AI unclogs you. Jump. Jump. Jump. And then you'll be perfectly fine. Jump. Now you might

06:29:55.760 --> 06:30:01.200
have to fight them at the end. I honestly don't understand what the development team actually

06:30:01.200 --> 06:30:07.760
wanted from you at this point. Please leave me alone. But oh, he almost touched me. He touched

06:30:07.760 --> 06:30:14.960
my ankle. Oh, he's touching me. He's touching me. Okay. And then they opened up. And then we just go

06:30:14.960 --> 06:30:20.560
inside. And then sometimes you may have to come outside and fight, but it's okay. It's okay.

06:30:21.520 --> 06:30:31.200
Okay. So we were... That's a lot of bad guys. Okay. We got one.

06:30:34.560 --> 06:30:41.920
Oh, I'm getting ganged on. I'm getting ganged up. I don't like it. Take this. And this. And this.

06:30:42.720 --> 06:30:51.760
And this. And this. Okay. Unfortunately, we are in range because of that yellow on the map,

06:30:51.760 --> 06:31:00.080
but we might be able to stand here. It should time out because they're not supposed to actually

06:31:00.080 --> 06:31:08.560
see us. There we go. There we go. Now, did you guys remember the pineapple? Did you remember the

06:31:08.560 --> 06:31:15.360
pineapple? We did a little eagle vision. The pineapple is glowing.

06:31:22.480 --> 06:31:28.560
I was right there. What? I was there all along. Excuse me.

06:31:38.560 --> 06:31:42.560
Hydration.

06:31:45.760 --> 06:31:48.480
That... Those armor clinking sounds. Good sound effect.

06:31:50.000 --> 06:32:01.760
Gods! Gods! Oh, Chesery. Your time can't last. Not while I come in with the apple. Okay. So,

06:32:01.760 --> 06:32:09.280
basically, just run. Wait, hold on. Let me open the map. Sorry to bring down the energy. I need

06:32:09.280 --> 06:32:13.680
to open the map because I always forget which direction I need to go in. So I need to keep

06:32:13.680 --> 06:32:27.120
going dead ahead and then take a right. Okay, let's go. It is just a waste of time trying to stop and

06:32:28.080 --> 06:32:34.400
get rid of all these enemies. There's no point. So just outrun them until you get to the water

06:32:34.400 --> 06:32:42.560
and swim like your life depends on it. They keep... They're jumping me. Get off. Get off.

06:32:43.760 --> 06:32:51.360
Away. Naughty. No. If you follow this street, I think it takes you to the water.

06:32:51.680 --> 06:32:56.880
Oh, I don't like those brute guys. They're actually pretty strong.

06:33:06.000 --> 06:33:13.920
When the moon hits your high like a big pizza pie, that's a mooring.

06:33:13.920 --> 06:33:31.920
And that's how you get away from that sequence. Jump on that boat and get out of there. You

06:33:31.920 --> 06:33:38.000
do not have to attack anyone. You do not have to eliminate any enemies. Jump in that boat and you

06:33:38.000 --> 06:33:44.000
are safe. Over and thank you.

06:33:56.240 --> 06:33:58.000
When the moon hits your eye, that's a straw knee.

06:33:58.720 --> 06:34:03.040
My men were to throw the zithi, but we might be the naughty. We am one.

06:34:05.440 --> 06:34:10.960
It's blinding. Oh, my model's not reactive to what happens on screen. I need to put that back on.

06:34:10.960 --> 06:34:13.040
I love that. That was like the funniest thing.

06:34:13.200 --> 06:34:24.080
And my eyes. We do have no variety. A sight to see us known.

06:34:28.880 --> 06:34:29.520
Flashbang.

06:34:32.800 --> 06:34:36.080
I think for the loser guards and touch the pineapple without heart and I know you just

06:34:36.080 --> 06:34:40.960
pop a smoke bomb and get in a crowded bench. I wonder that may be the solution.

06:34:43.040 --> 06:34:53.040
At once. I do not care how. We cannot on our own, you must help us. I am here. Idiot. Idiot.

06:34:55.840 --> 06:34:59.440
And then you will see how quickly the asasini fall.

06:34:59.600 --> 06:35:17.120
Oh, right. So the apple is a bit funny. Do you see that white one? That white line means imminent death.

06:35:17.920 --> 06:35:20.000
The yellow means under my control.

06:35:21.680 --> 06:35:27.840
And so we want to basically the apple will take your health. So I have to wait until it restores

06:35:28.640 --> 06:35:34.000
and then wait. And then it kills the people who we want to kill. And then the others are either

06:35:34.000 --> 06:35:38.480
under my control or will fight for me. It's a bit finicky, but once you learn it, you get it.

06:35:42.240 --> 06:35:45.280
We're teleporting all over the map. We're at the blooming

06:35:46.880 --> 06:35:53.520
rose. Yes. Under stress.

06:35:54.080 --> 06:36:00.720
Any anyone else under stress? Anyone feeling about A.K. needing a bit of a

06:36:02.880 --> 06:36:04.400
I'm not gonna say it's too easy. Too easy.

06:36:09.760 --> 06:36:14.800
So the point of Assassin's Creed is to get rid of the apples of Eden. However,

06:36:15.760 --> 06:36:23.200
Ezio is a good, good boy and his DNA communes with the apple. So his bloodline

06:36:24.000 --> 06:36:29.040
kind of has been chosen. I'm pretty sure the guy's around this corner, actually,

06:36:29.040 --> 06:36:31.280
and I've gone too far. Yeah, there is.

06:36:35.040 --> 06:36:41.200
Fail at the cardinal. I think he just runs down this hill and then that's it. You do not have

06:36:41.280 --> 06:36:45.040
our access to your recruits at this time, but you don't need it because you literally have the

06:36:45.040 --> 06:36:50.960
apple of Eden. I will say one thing. The more, oh no, actually, it doesn't affect with the more

06:36:50.960 --> 06:36:57.120
armor you have. Also, on the weapon wheel, you can't select anything when you hold the apple of Eden.

06:36:57.120 --> 06:36:58.320
I won't even let you take it out.

06:37:02.800 --> 06:37:03.440
Take anything.

06:37:03.680 --> 06:37:08.320
So we just need to follow him into the Colosseum.

06:37:10.000 --> 06:37:18.160
Fuck it. No, no, I'm not here. No, no, you didn't see me. No, you're actually a liar.

06:37:19.520 --> 06:37:26.320
And I, oh, you guards just spawned in. Don't lie. You just spawned in right in front of me.

06:37:27.280 --> 06:37:28.320
Is it safe?

06:37:49.520 --> 06:37:54.720
My bikini affairs have been mentioned enough. I've unbinded everything,

06:37:55.360 --> 06:37:58.800
so there's no chance of accident or bikini show. I apologize.

06:38:02.800 --> 06:38:05.760
Borgia? Mind Control Apple?

06:38:13.360 --> 06:38:19.440
Okay, again, same thing. Unfortunately, this is very awkward and you can call in your recruits,

06:38:20.240 --> 06:38:24.160
but it's not very good at all. I'm trying. Okay, this isn't working.

06:38:24.720 --> 06:38:29.920
Wait, he attacked me and he died? Did you see that? Right, I'm just calling in my recruits.

06:38:29.920 --> 06:38:35.840
They're not very strong, but we'll try. We'll try. I don't normally like doing it because

06:38:35.840 --> 06:38:41.760
recruits can definitely die at this section because of the overwhelming amount of enemies

06:38:43.840 --> 06:38:49.200
that come in. But again, white mark around who you would wish to eliminate right off the bat,

06:38:49.200 --> 06:38:55.840
and hopefully my assassin recruits stay around. So he's coming straight for me,

06:38:55.840 --> 06:39:01.200
so once I've healed up again, you just need to do the white. You can also see the white line

06:39:01.200 --> 06:39:06.640
on their, the horse knocked him out of range, so we'll need to try that one again.

06:39:07.840 --> 06:39:15.200
So they're now fighting each other actually. But again, white line, I got him. Yeah,

06:39:15.200 --> 06:39:19.520
I see my assassin recruits are getting damaged on their health. I really do not enjoy calling them

06:39:19.520 --> 06:39:24.800
in on this mission. It is dangerous. You can lose recruits here. If they're not leveled up enough,

06:39:24.800 --> 06:39:33.280
I really did not spend much. Where's the apple? Whoa, he's like slow mo getting me. Okay, we've got

06:39:33.280 --> 06:39:39.600
two more to go, two more to go. Let him get up, let him get up. We'll go for him first because you

06:39:39.600 --> 06:39:45.280
actually, no, we won't because my assassin recruit just did that. Oh, someone's low, not good, not

06:39:45.280 --> 06:39:55.840
good. This is why I really don't want anyone to perish. Did he survive? I didn't get a notification

06:39:55.840 --> 06:40:01.520
saying that one passed away. I think we don't know. I know very much of an ASMR enjoyer, but

06:40:01.520 --> 06:40:08.320
Amy changed your mind. That's fantastic. You just got to find someone that fits your groove and they

06:40:08.320 --> 06:40:16.640
can interest you into something new. Johnny, Miss Ma, how are you doing? Have you been good?

06:40:21.440 --> 06:40:28.720
We played assassin's recruit up in this house. We're literally about to finish the game after an

06:40:28.720 --> 06:40:35.120
amazing gaming session. You can ignore the guards here. The campaign should take over once you approach

06:40:35.120 --> 06:40:41.920
these guards here. So very good. Another time here. Did you stream today? Or have you streamed yet?

06:40:44.400 --> 06:40:45.520
Or are you taking break today?

06:40:48.080 --> 06:40:50.640
At least ASMR was great at Dozed off. That's fun to have.

06:40:50.960 --> 06:41:02.400
So now we get our cool Avengers moment where everyone's with us helping us.

06:41:04.240 --> 06:41:15.840
You can actually successfully kill all everyone in the sequence. Oh, I can't use my blades. I'm so

06:41:16.160 --> 06:41:21.760
used to using them. You're still playing? Absolutely. We're just about to finish the campaign. I'm so

06:41:21.760 --> 06:41:28.720
excited. Oh no, that recruit is so low. Oh, I feel like I need to help him. Oh no. Okay, okay, good

06:41:28.720 --> 06:41:35.200
catch, good catch. Oh no, that. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:41:36.240 --> 06:41:43.760
I'm dead. I only have one HP. Oh, I needed to regen. No, I don't want any assassins to fall.

06:41:44.560 --> 06:41:48.640
Stop attacking her. Stop. I don't have health to freaking use the apple.

06:41:49.280 --> 06:42:00.240
Please gang up on him. Thank you. My goodness. Oh, no. Oh, please. Okay, yellow. Oh, someone's

06:42:00.240 --> 06:42:10.960
going to pass away. I don't want anyone to pass away. Okay, so we've just finished that. Oh, no one

06:42:10.960 --> 06:42:18.080
perished. Oh, wait, that was so lucky. So we've now finished the sequence and we're all waiting.

06:42:19.680 --> 06:42:21.360
All five of us avenger style.

06:42:21.360 --> 06:42:29.520
On your arm, Cezare Borgia, the Coletus troops must behind me. We will take back my city once and for

06:42:29.520 --> 06:42:38.560
all. This is not your city anymore. By order of Pope Julius II, I arrested Cezare Borgia for the crimes

06:42:38.560 --> 06:42:49.600
of murder, betrayal, and incest. No, no, no, no, this is not how it ends. James will not hold me.

06:42:50.160 --> 06:42:52.720
I will not die by the hands of man.

06:42:59.520 --> 06:43:03.680
Was the manner in which he said it. James will not hold me.

06:43:04.400 --> 06:43:13.040
Didn't know that was a crime back then. Honestly, true question marks because all we hear about blood

06:43:13.040 --> 06:43:20.480
lines is, uh, you know, about royals and that. So was it like royals are allowed to do it, but

06:43:20.480 --> 06:43:23.760
the common people aren't allowed to do it, you know, as peasants?

06:43:23.760 --> 06:43:33.840
I must go.

06:43:38.640 --> 06:43:39.840
I need to leave. My people need me.

06:43:39.840 --> 06:43:45.760
I built this brotherhood to last with or without me. What do you intend to do? Plant a seed.

06:43:48.960 --> 06:43:55.120
This is goodbye. Then keep your money. I do not want it. We will see each other again. You have my

06:43:55.120 --> 06:44:05.600
good luck. Take the money. Your meager salary. You will need it.

06:44:06.320 --> 06:44:18.960
My patron has been arrested after all. You've got a lot for tuna. Oops.

06:44:19.200 --> 06:44:29.280
There was a limit. Cousins and relatives seemed, okay, direct bloodline off.

06:44:30.960 --> 06:44:40.800
Yeah. Oh, why is my tracking, is my, why is my tracking stopped? Hello?

06:44:41.040 --> 06:44:48.160
Uh, uh, uh, is my PC dead or is it just my tracking has gave up?

06:44:49.520 --> 06:44:51.040
Hey, you want to recalibrate real quick?

06:44:56.400 --> 06:45:07.280
Uh, uh, uh, I need to play, but my thing is not working. Woo. Hello? No, it's not. I have my

06:45:07.280 --> 06:45:14.000
iPhone on fire. Oh, my iPhone is burning. Uh, let me just pause that real quick. Oh,

06:45:14.720 --> 06:45:26.000
did you see all of them? Uh, oh, okay, hold on. Uh, that, am I back up to sync? Okay. Uh,

06:45:26.720 --> 06:45:38.560
just yeah. It's like in so fast there. Oh, oh, then a cannonball should appear. Yeah,

06:45:38.560 --> 06:45:45.200
there you go. Cannonball and it got me as well. My iPhone's on fire.

06:45:50.160 --> 06:45:54.720
Hidden blade only. Let's go. I'm a hidden blade. Some people enjoy the source. Some people

06:45:54.720 --> 06:46:02.640
enjoy the heavy weaponry. Uh, a double assassin blade for me. I died there. I better not have died.

06:46:04.960 --> 06:46:10.800
The phone's about to explode honestly. I hope not, but it's very hot. I think because it's charged,

06:46:10.800 --> 06:46:18.480
like I've charged it, um, this entire time. Like it's got charger input, so.

06:46:18.480 --> 06:46:29.600
Oh, the iPhone better get used to it. Uh, you better not be, uh, better raise the stamina levels for me.

06:46:32.720 --> 06:46:41.040
Mm. The cinematic, uh, like when it does, like, the cinematic kill, it looks so nice on, like,

06:46:41.040 --> 06:46:46.240
all the different weaponry. I have to admit. So, like, obviously not mad if someone prepares

06:46:46.240 --> 06:46:55.920
something else. Not the whole. Oh, wait, no, I lied. I lied. I thought all the horsies got. No!

06:46:59.360 --> 06:47:04.960
I completely forgot. I thought all the horsies got back up. Why would they do that at the end of the

06:47:04.960 --> 06:47:11.920
game? Assume I'm allowed to be spotted. Doesn't matter if I get spotted or is this one of the

06:47:11.920 --> 06:47:22.000
ones where I shouldn't be spotted? No, I can be spotted. That's absolutely fine with me.

06:47:22.960 --> 06:47:29.440
Ooh, but they're heavy. Heavy infantry. I'm trying to say they're heavy infantry. Right,

06:47:29.440 --> 06:47:33.840
doesn't matter if I get spotted, so I'm just going to send it. Oh, I can't believe I forgot

06:47:33.840 --> 06:47:41.040
about that horsey-warcy. I do apologize. I don't like when they do that. He's just taken an app.

06:47:41.120 --> 06:47:46.160
He's just taken an app. I mean, I'd take one too. You know, he needs to sleep it off. He needs to sleep

06:47:46.160 --> 06:47:53.120
off what happened. No, you've not seen me before, unless you know it's the only time.

06:48:03.600 --> 06:48:08.800
The battery swelled up? Who are you doing? I left my Android phone on charge for a year and the

06:48:08.800 --> 06:48:16.480
battery swelled, like, like, popped like a balloon-type swell? It's as dangerous.

06:48:27.440 --> 06:48:29.120
Honestly, pretty brutal scene.

06:48:29.120 --> 06:48:36.480
Huh. Leave me alone.

06:48:42.960 --> 06:48:47.680
Unfortunately for this section, both factions will target you.

06:48:51.680 --> 06:48:57.760
So the best advice really is to go at the checkpoint and destroy whoever goes for you.

06:48:59.760 --> 06:49:05.120
Um, they will always sign, but you can't progress until they leave you alone. So

06:49:05.120 --> 06:49:11.440
just, I can't actually see what's going on, but thank you. Okay, there you go. You just need to

06:49:11.440 --> 06:49:17.440
wait for them to leave you alone. You need to water my battery. Make sure it's not too cool.

06:49:21.760 --> 06:49:28.400
Yes, so the smartest thing to do is to claim the burning siege tower. You're so smart. The

06:49:28.400 --> 06:49:36.480
wooden flammable siege tower. I'm not sure about that one, Enzo. I like your accent. Thanks, Spondyn with it.

06:49:39.360 --> 06:49:42.480
Spacey phone pillow keeps your pillow nice and warm.

06:49:44.560 --> 06:49:46.560
Do we need to take the rooftops? I actually...

06:49:47.840 --> 06:49:54.000
Well, that was a lot of enemies to appear on the screen. This section is the same,

06:49:54.000 --> 06:50:02.800
where both factions will target you. You need to become anonymous. Can I hide behind this and

06:50:04.560 --> 06:50:07.840
be left alone? Oh, is he gonna attack me?

06:50:12.480 --> 06:50:19.120
Okay, okay. I was trying to see if I can get away with it. It's just a bit like, why would they both

06:50:19.120 --> 06:50:25.840
randomly target me? I have no fight with them? But I don't even know who they're. They're fighting

06:50:25.840 --> 06:50:31.920
each other and they're the same. They have the same uniform on. They found the traitor.

06:50:35.520 --> 06:50:40.160
I know what's wrong when I'm going to guess. Leave me alone.

06:50:40.480 --> 06:50:47.360
Right, let's try again. This time, it's not on fire.

06:50:49.760 --> 06:50:52.080
My world's on fire. How about yours?

06:50:57.520 --> 06:51:02.800
The water's getting warm, so you might as well swim. I don't know the words. I can never remember

06:51:03.360 --> 06:51:12.000
words. I can never remember words in order of actual songs. And then the best I can do is go,

06:51:14.880 --> 06:51:21.280
the back streets. Hey, never go on. What you gonna say? What you gonna do? That's not the word.

06:51:22.240 --> 06:51:30.000
Hey now, you're an assassin. Get your game on. Go play Caesar's gonna. His name's not Caesar.

06:51:30.000 --> 06:51:43.200
Chasery's gonna die. Kicking in the balls. Oh, dear. Hey. That's right, baby.

06:51:47.840 --> 06:51:52.720
So much to kill, so much to do, so much assassinating. On the spreadsheets,

06:51:53.680 --> 06:52:00.800
never know when I'm gonna strike. Hey, don't know if it's good advice. Hey, so much to

06:52:00.800 --> 06:52:08.400
pew, so much to do. Gotta disarm the guard. I can't do that, so that's fine. I'm taking out the double

06:52:08.400 --> 06:52:20.480
knife. Trying to pistol whip. Try again with the tip. It's actually much easier just to shoot

06:52:20.560 --> 06:52:24.240
Chasery. There, if you shoot him, you take a health bar.

06:52:26.720 --> 06:52:34.240
And removing his armor. He wishes he was a farmer. Oh, he got me first.

06:52:36.880 --> 06:52:43.920
You can't spam it. No, run at a time. He broke the armor. Oh, that's not good. Oh, that's not good.

06:52:44.640 --> 06:52:46.720
Okay, I actually don't want that. I'm taking out my double blades.

06:52:51.280 --> 06:53:00.880
Take this. Take that. And this. And take my knee to your boss. My knee to your boss.

06:53:02.000 --> 06:53:08.240
Denny, wanna put my boss on your jaws. It's my knee. Oh, shit. Right. I'm actually

06:53:08.240 --> 06:53:12.960
kind of messing this up. I may need to try hard. Hold on. Hold on. Let me get rid of these guards

06:53:12.960 --> 06:53:18.320
first and then go for Chasery. But then, whoa, wait, wait, wait. You can't keep spawning new guards.

06:53:20.240 --> 06:53:27.680
I mean, maybe you can, but like, you shouldn't. You should give me a chance to kill. Oh,

06:53:27.680 --> 06:53:32.480
we're getting a bit crowded. We're getting a bit crowded in here. There aren't too many of yous.

06:53:32.480 --> 06:53:42.640
This is starting to get a bit, he's gonna, can I do this? Okay, Chasery is, that's fine.

06:53:42.640 --> 06:53:49.760
I expected that. Okay, Chasery's like one. Seriously, he's like one. Okay.

06:53:51.440 --> 06:53:54.320
One more. Reload faster. Okay, there we go.

06:53:58.640 --> 06:54:00.400
Actually, how much Nick armor do you have?

06:54:00.400 --> 06:54:04.880
The throne was mine. Wanting something does not make it your right.

06:54:04.880 --> 06:54:10.240
I love your mother, babe. That the true leader empowers the people he rules.

06:54:10.240 --> 06:54:12.880
I will lead mankind into a new world.

06:54:21.120 --> 06:54:26.160
No man can murder me. Then I leave you in the hands of fate.

06:54:40.240 --> 06:54:45.200
The throne was mine.

06:54:47.520 --> 06:54:49.520
What do you know? What do you know?

06:54:52.960 --> 06:54:56.240
Get dunked on. I will lead mankind into a new world.

06:54:57.040 --> 06:54:58.880
We take it literally in these parts.

06:55:02.640 --> 06:55:06.800
You cannot kill me. No man can murder me.

06:55:10.640 --> 06:55:15.840
The apple.

06:55:21.920 --> 06:55:27.440
The vault. Oh my god, we're playing Borderlands 2. It's the vault.

06:55:27.680 --> 06:55:39.760
So Ezio has put the apple of Eden away and the vault left behind by the gods.

06:55:40.640 --> 06:55:42.240
So it's not in the hands of man.

06:55:49.440 --> 06:55:52.160
We've got it. We're about to go to present day.

06:55:52.240 --> 06:55:57.360
Gravity cleaves another victim. Full damage buff.

06:56:11.040 --> 06:56:11.920
Perfect recall.

06:56:17.920 --> 06:56:20.400
Oh my god. It's gold.

06:56:21.360 --> 06:56:25.360
It's kind of why I'm saying it out now. I'll be quiet. I'm sorry.

06:56:25.360 --> 06:56:26.240
I'm sorry. I'm getting too excited.

06:56:32.160 --> 06:56:39.440
Like that European power grid. Ah yes, Italy. The only country in Europe you've got.

06:56:40.720 --> 06:56:42.000
Problem is he's dead.

06:56:42.000 --> 06:56:44.480
I can't believe we're stuck here.

06:56:49.360 --> 06:56:52.160
A few cutscenes up ahead so I'll try and be quiet. I'm just getting so excited.

06:56:52.160 --> 06:56:55.040
So I do apologize for talking over like so.

06:56:56.400 --> 06:56:58.080
I'm just a bit of a silly belly.

06:56:59.360 --> 06:57:01.120
Hey, maybe it has something to do with this.

06:57:01.120 --> 06:57:12.720
A symbol matches the one on the door to the vault.

06:57:14.080 --> 06:57:19.280
1419, 1420, 1421. What if they aren't dates?

06:57:19.280 --> 06:57:26.160
1419, 1420. Oh my god. What?

06:57:26.880 --> 06:57:30.320
God. Tell us already.

06:57:30.320 --> 06:57:36.320
I am. I am. The tetragrammaton. The 72 names of God. You see?

06:57:36.320 --> 06:57:40.640
They're all contained within three verses. Exodus 19 through 21.

06:57:40.640 --> 06:57:44.800
And to get this your likeness, if you arrange the four Hebrew letters in God's name within

06:57:44.800 --> 06:57:51.440
an equilateral triangle, their numerical values add up to the same number. 72.

06:57:51.440 --> 06:57:53.200
Are you absolutely sure about this?

06:57:53.840 --> 06:57:56.240
That's kind of why I'm saying it out loud, Rebecca. Yeah.

06:57:56.240 --> 06:57:58.000
But I haven't lost the kicker yet.

06:57:58.720 --> 06:58:03.680
Construction on the Colosseum began in the year 72.

06:58:04.800 --> 06:58:07.680
I think we have our password. Sean, go get the van.

06:58:13.840 --> 06:58:20.400
We now know the password to the vault in order to get the apple of Eden.

06:58:21.280 --> 06:58:24.400
I'm a Calibri again. Hold on.

06:58:28.800 --> 06:58:31.760
Okay. I calibrated. No, my my friend.

06:58:33.600 --> 06:58:37.200
You know everything. I really like this game.

06:58:39.680 --> 06:58:40.720
That's right. I've seen your car.

06:58:51.120 --> 06:58:56.320
Base the Assassin's Creed said women bad driver.

06:59:02.320 --> 06:59:07.360
That's terrible. Dev team, you know exactly what you're doing for nothing.

06:59:11.600 --> 06:59:13.840
There's a lot of dialogue up ahead, so try and be quiet.

06:59:15.920 --> 06:59:17.680
Lucy, I'm making my way toward the entrance.

06:59:18.640 --> 06:59:19.280
Okay, good.

06:59:20.240 --> 06:59:23.440
Can you see any gladiators? My advice would be like it.

06:59:25.040 --> 06:59:26.080
I'll keep that in mind.

06:59:38.640 --> 06:59:40.720
I can't believe I'm actually going to hold the apple.

06:59:41.760 --> 06:59:44.240
It's been a long time coming. You've earned it.

06:59:45.200 --> 06:59:49.040
I wonder if it'll change things, whether it can tip the scales in our favor.

06:59:49.920 --> 06:59:53.360
Me trying not to read it like say every quote that I remember.

06:59:54.960 --> 06:59:58.240
I was going to say tip the scales. I don't know if they might pick that up, but it's a little bit.

07:00:02.000 --> 07:00:02.960
What do you think we'll find?

07:00:04.000 --> 07:00:05.440
Hopefully a map of a temple.

07:00:06.480 --> 07:00:10.720
The apple's just going to give it to us. Is it? Yeah? Who's Elvis over there?

07:00:11.680 --> 07:00:13.440
Hey, maybe this time we'll be lucky.

07:00:18.880 --> 07:00:22.240
On my first playthrough, I never found this for ages.

07:00:23.360 --> 07:00:24.720
It's so slight and cheeky.

07:00:28.720 --> 07:00:31.440
So much construction. This place is like a maze.

07:00:32.320 --> 07:00:37.760
The hypergeum house, the cages of the gladiators, and the machines which raised them for the service.

07:00:37.840 --> 07:00:41.280
The whole area you're in right now was originally covered by the arena.

07:00:42.640 --> 07:00:43.280
Good to know.

07:00:45.840 --> 07:00:51.280
So at the end of this, there's a quote from the gods.

07:00:54.480 --> 07:00:56.160
And I said a message.

07:00:57.920 --> 07:00:58.560
Oh wait, hold on.

07:00:59.760 --> 07:01:03.040
My birthday! So that's why we're playing this game on my birthday.

07:01:04.000 --> 07:01:07.600
Because it's October 10th in the present day!

07:01:24.320 --> 07:01:29.920
Um, okay. If I don't move, the cutscene's not going to begin.

07:01:30.560 --> 07:01:34.560
But I just want to say there's a quote from the god at the end of this.

07:01:34.560 --> 07:01:35.840
And she says go forth.

07:01:37.360 --> 07:01:42.560
And I may or may not have said be embraced by the six because of that quote.

07:01:43.280 --> 07:01:45.200
And I hope you understand it when you hear it.

07:01:47.280 --> 07:01:48.720
So be embraced by the six.

07:01:49.680 --> 07:01:51.520
It's because it's all my love.

07:01:54.240 --> 07:01:55.760
And the allure is the six.

07:01:57.520 --> 07:01:59.040
Just wait for it, okay? Just wait for it.

07:01:59.040 --> 07:02:00.080
I tell you, I tell you.

07:02:00.080 --> 07:02:01.040
I show you, I show you.

07:02:02.400 --> 07:02:05.040
But I hope the six have embraced you dearly.

07:02:07.040 --> 07:02:08.320
Embrace those by the...

07:02:08.320 --> 07:02:10.560
No! Set six! Number six!

07:02:10.560 --> 07:02:14.160
Numero en dos tres, cuatro, cinco, cinco, seis.

07:02:14.720 --> 07:02:16.240
I know it's kind of hard just...

07:02:29.280 --> 07:02:30.880
...to keep his path forward.

07:02:30.880 --> 07:02:33.440
I'd save the world we leave behind.

07:02:34.240 --> 07:02:34.880
Who are you?

07:02:39.440 --> 07:02:39.920
Jino.

07:02:41.040 --> 07:02:41.440
Nothing.

07:02:47.760 --> 07:02:50.000
We're getting close boys to the end.

07:02:50.000 --> 07:02:51.440
I don't want it to end, but...

07:02:54.640 --> 07:02:57.600
That's been a fan past the cleanest campaign.

07:02:57.600 --> 07:02:58.560
Sorry, I went the wrong way.

07:02:58.560 --> 07:03:00.400
Daphne, I know what we'd go through.

07:03:04.960 --> 07:03:07.200
I'm getting really close to getting chills

07:03:07.200 --> 07:03:08.640
because I know what's up ahead.

07:03:18.720 --> 07:03:21.920
In the beginning, we set our truths to parchment.

07:03:22.640 --> 07:03:23.280
To stone.

07:03:24.000 --> 07:03:25.360
To the memory of men.

07:03:26.320 --> 07:03:28.080
These proved impermanent things.

07:03:28.080 --> 07:03:29.200
Oh, sorry, my mouth's open.

07:03:29.200 --> 07:03:34.640
Lens by fire. Lens by famine. Lens by blood.

07:03:35.600 --> 07:03:38.240
All the world is in this and all the more.

07:03:38.240 --> 07:03:40.960
Innocent and ignorant.

07:03:43.840 --> 07:03:45.840
Oh, cleansed by fire.

07:03:46.400 --> 07:03:47.600
Cleansed by famine.

07:03:49.280 --> 07:03:51.200
Such like, good dialogue.

07:03:52.160 --> 07:03:54.800
Just to show that history cannot last on parchment.

07:03:54.800 --> 07:03:57.120
Like, it's just such a genius.

07:04:12.640 --> 07:04:14.880
Yeah, you think you found an entrance after the, like,

07:04:14.880 --> 07:04:17.200
the freaking floor the pavilion opens up?

07:04:17.200 --> 07:04:18.640
Okay, yeah, entrance, okay.

07:04:25.760 --> 07:04:26.240
Mm-hmm.

07:04:28.400 --> 07:04:29.360
Oh, I'm getting chills.

07:04:41.920 --> 07:04:42.560
Let me in.

07:04:44.160 --> 07:04:44.720
I'm coming.

07:04:50.320 --> 07:04:51.440
But on what can it last?

07:04:51.440 --> 07:04:52.160
Took you long enough.

07:04:53.520 --> 07:04:54.160
What is this place?

07:04:54.400 --> 07:04:55.840
What happens if it didn't have to last?

07:04:57.840 --> 07:05:00.400
What if we just enjoyed every moment we could get?

07:05:07.840 --> 07:05:08.720
I like the ceiling.

07:05:09.520 --> 07:05:10.480
Dude, you like the ceiling?

07:05:11.280 --> 07:05:13.520
You are a fascinating traveling companion.

07:05:13.840 --> 07:05:14.320
Mm.

07:05:24.000 --> 07:05:26.400
Look how detailed this is.

07:05:29.280 --> 07:05:32.800
Like, 2010.

07:05:35.120 --> 07:05:37.440
Like, look how accurate it is.

07:05:37.440 --> 07:05:39.440
Please, can we do history games?

07:05:40.080 --> 07:05:42.160
Where we can all just nerd about history

07:05:42.160 --> 07:05:43.600
and, like, the things...

07:05:43.600 --> 07:05:46.080
Like, they even bother to do the text and stuff,

07:05:46.080 --> 07:05:47.360
like, under the paintings to be like,

07:05:47.360 --> 07:05:47.920
this is from...

07:05:49.760 --> 07:05:51.200
Like, ah!

07:05:52.880 --> 07:05:54.560
Ah, it's such a good game!

07:05:58.960 --> 07:06:00.560
Just appreciate everything.

07:06:00.560 --> 07:06:02.160
It's so good, it's so good.

07:06:02.160 --> 07:06:03.840
I'm so glad I get to share the game with you.

07:06:04.480 --> 07:06:06.720
And hopefully you maybe play on your own sometime.

07:06:08.160 --> 07:06:09.520
You have to experience all...

07:06:12.240 --> 07:06:13.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:06:18.320 --> 07:06:19.600
That guy is sassy.

07:06:19.600 --> 07:06:21.360
Sean is a very sassy character.

07:06:22.720 --> 07:06:25.120
A very British, uh, deadpan.

07:06:28.160 --> 07:06:28.560
Wow.

07:06:30.480 --> 07:06:32.000
Ready to speak to the gods?

07:06:38.480 --> 07:06:38.800
Wow.

07:06:42.160 --> 07:06:45.200
And now they are our final, vaulted hope.

07:06:46.240 --> 07:06:47.520
You are they.

07:06:52.160 --> 07:06:53.360
Hey, actually, I'm a he-him?

07:06:54.400 --> 07:06:54.800
Sorry.

07:06:54.800 --> 07:06:55.920
You have the best understanding.

07:06:56.560 --> 07:07:00.480
But you broke our tools, or turned them against one another.

07:07:01.360 --> 07:07:02.880
We have destroyed what we could.

07:07:03.440 --> 07:07:05.280
Sealed away what we could not.

07:07:09.120 --> 07:07:09.600
This is...

07:07:10.480 --> 07:07:11.600
Destroyed what we could.

07:07:11.600 --> 07:07:12.720
Sealed away if not.

07:07:18.720 --> 07:07:19.220
What?

07:07:20.720 --> 07:07:21.220
Oh shit.

07:07:39.680 --> 07:07:40.400
The time...

07:07:41.520 --> 07:07:42.560
Time he roads us.

07:07:46.000 --> 07:07:47.040
We can distract him.

07:07:47.680 --> 07:07:49.280
We can see past him.

07:07:49.280 --> 07:07:51.200
He ain't left when he strikes right.

07:07:51.840 --> 07:07:53.840
But his reach is so very long.

07:07:54.480 --> 07:07:56.560
He's stamina unending.

07:07:57.440 --> 07:07:58.880
We cannot evade his grasp.

07:07:59.440 --> 07:08:00.240
Not forever.

07:08:02.400 --> 07:08:02.880
Wow.

07:08:03.760 --> 07:08:04.640
Here goes.

07:08:04.640 --> 07:08:07.360
So she's telling us why the gods perished.

07:08:07.680 --> 07:08:11.920
Because something constantly is getting them.

07:08:13.200 --> 07:08:14.800
Just like Stony Stamina.

07:08:16.000 --> 07:08:17.600
Yeah, I'm refling you like that.

07:08:17.600 --> 07:08:19.120
My stamina's unending.

07:08:20.640 --> 07:08:22.640
It's a shame you have a refractory period.

07:08:28.640 --> 07:08:33.680
It must come in with the blood of me.

07:08:38.160 --> 07:08:50.160
I'm... I'm shone in this one.

07:08:53.600 --> 07:08:55.520
I'm holding onto the little knob in the middle.

07:09:01.120 --> 07:09:02.080
Oh, we're doing it.

07:09:03.040 --> 07:09:05.440
If you want to kill us, mate,

07:09:05.440 --> 07:09:07.280
you're going to have to try a little harder than that.

07:09:09.360 --> 07:09:09.840
Wow.

07:09:10.880 --> 07:09:11.280
We're here.

07:09:13.120 --> 07:09:13.840
Music.

07:09:15.520 --> 07:09:17.760
And just the beautiful scenery.

07:09:17.760 --> 07:09:18.560
The details.

07:09:24.800 --> 07:09:25.600
Statues.

07:09:26.640 --> 07:09:27.760
Sean's right, that is.

07:09:27.760 --> 07:09:28.640
I'm always right.

07:09:29.520 --> 07:09:30.640
About that dead end.

07:09:31.520 --> 07:09:32.320
That never happened.

07:09:32.320 --> 07:09:32.880
I was misquoted.

07:09:32.880 --> 07:09:35.760
Music picks up and you can hear the voices.

07:09:37.360 --> 07:09:40.960
Oh, just ethereal sounding voices.

07:09:43.040 --> 07:09:46.000
Just in awe and just awe.

07:09:47.280 --> 07:09:48.240
This not the door.

07:09:48.240 --> 07:09:48.640
Is it?

07:09:48.640 --> 07:09:49.440
Am I being pranked?

07:09:49.440 --> 07:09:50.560
Why does this look like the door?

07:09:52.080 --> 07:09:52.800
I'm being pranked.

07:09:53.840 --> 07:09:55.440
There's really a secret behind that.

07:09:55.440 --> 07:09:56.720
That kind of looks like there may be a secret,

07:09:56.720 --> 07:09:58.080
but maybe it's just a reused asset.

07:09:58.640 --> 07:10:00.480
But all the music.

07:10:02.800 --> 07:10:04.240
You think it speaks English?

07:10:04.880 --> 07:10:05.520
Just say it.

07:10:06.240 --> 07:10:06.560
Okay.

07:10:08.480 --> 07:10:09.200
72.

07:10:11.360 --> 07:10:11.680
Wow.

07:10:24.640 --> 07:10:26.240
After you, I think.

07:10:28.080 --> 07:10:28.800
Music.

07:10:32.800 --> 07:10:34.160
Now you guys have to see this.

07:10:39.360 --> 07:10:40.160
There's ethereal.

07:10:48.240 --> 07:10:49.680
The apple seems to be in the center.

07:10:53.600 --> 07:10:55.200
Time to find out where those temples are.

07:10:55.600 --> 07:10:59.200
Okay, no.

07:10:59.200 --> 07:11:00.800
This is where the sad part comes in,

07:11:00.800 --> 07:11:02.240
because I always mess up the sequence.

07:11:04.000 --> 07:11:04.560
I'm really.

07:11:12.400 --> 07:11:13.520
Always mess up the sequence.

07:11:15.600 --> 07:11:16.080
The orb.

07:11:25.600 --> 07:11:28.720
Big lady.

07:11:31.840 --> 07:11:32.320
Knowledge.

07:11:38.480 --> 07:11:39.360
Oh, no, wisdom.

07:11:39.360 --> 07:11:40.000
No, knowledge.

07:11:40.000 --> 07:11:40.240
Sorry.

07:11:40.240 --> 07:11:41.120
Wisdom, wisdom.

07:11:44.320 --> 07:11:44.800
Oh, no.

07:11:47.040 --> 07:11:47.520
Close enough.

07:11:47.520 --> 07:11:48.000
Fake gamer.

07:11:55.680 --> 07:11:58.800
You hear the words, but you do not know.

07:12:00.560 --> 07:12:02.400
I have played this game so many times.

07:12:02.400 --> 07:12:04.240
I always end up failing the levers.

07:12:04.240 --> 07:12:07.920
I didn't know you could eagle sense the lever.

07:12:09.600 --> 07:12:13.200
I just literally, my brain said maybe one's highlighted

07:12:13.200 --> 07:12:14.000
and the other isn't.

07:12:15.040 --> 07:12:16.400
How many times have I played this game

07:12:16.400 --> 07:12:17.440
and never done that before?

07:12:18.320 --> 07:12:20.000
I always mess up on the levers.

07:12:20.000 --> 07:12:21.760
It is hard to stay contained.

07:12:21.760 --> 07:12:22.480
Right, I'll be quiet.

07:12:22.480 --> 07:12:25.920
Knowing as we do, we wait for you, Desmond.

07:12:26.480 --> 07:12:27.520
You will come here.

07:12:28.160 --> 07:12:29.280
You will activate it.

07:12:30.160 --> 07:12:32.640
You will not be late.

07:12:34.080 --> 07:12:35.120
Did you hear any of that?

07:12:40.800 --> 07:12:44.640
I sure do love all my friends equally.

07:12:44.640 --> 07:12:46.560
I love Rebecca.

07:12:46.560 --> 07:12:48.320
I love Sean.

07:12:48.320 --> 07:12:50.480
And I love Lucy.

07:12:50.560 --> 07:12:53.520
And I'm sure all will be fine.

07:12:53.520 --> 07:12:54.320
Wait, where did I go?

07:12:54.320 --> 07:12:54.820
Oh.

07:12:54.820 --> 07:13:20.900
So where are the temples?

07:13:21.860 --> 07:13:22.820
You want me to ask it?

07:13:23.700 --> 07:13:24.900
Or think it or something.

07:13:32.660 --> 07:13:34.420
You sure you asked it the right thing?

07:13:35.460 --> 07:13:36.020
I know this.

07:13:36.020 --> 07:13:37.060
I know that symbol.

07:13:37.060 --> 07:13:38.660
That, that's a Phrygian camp.

07:13:39.220 --> 07:13:41.140
It stands for freedom.

07:13:41.140 --> 07:13:42.740
And that, that's a Masonic eye.

07:13:43.380 --> 07:13:45.620
Now those two come together in only one place.

07:13:46.260 --> 07:13:46.820
What's happening?

07:13:48.020 --> 07:13:49.140
I can't move.

07:13:49.140 --> 07:13:51.300
Your DNA communes with the apple.

07:13:51.860 --> 07:13:53.220
You have activated it.

07:13:54.420 --> 07:13:54.980
Let me go.

07:13:55.700 --> 07:13:58.900
On the 72nd day before the moment of awakening,

07:13:59.700 --> 07:14:03.860
you, birth from our loins and the loins of our enemies.

07:14:03.860 --> 07:14:07.620
The end and the beginning, who we abhor and honor.

07:14:08.420 --> 07:14:10.420
The final journey commences.

07:14:11.300 --> 07:14:14.260
There is one who would accompany you through the gate.

07:14:14.260 --> 07:14:15.860
She lies not within our sight.

07:14:16.740 --> 07:14:19.060
The cross darkens the horizon.

07:14:21.620 --> 07:14:22.100
Shhh.

07:14:23.940 --> 07:14:24.340
What are you doing?

07:14:25.620 --> 07:14:27.140
The path must be opened.

07:14:28.980 --> 07:14:31.220
You cannot escape or part in this.

07:14:31.220 --> 07:14:32.980
The scales shall be balanced.

07:14:36.260 --> 07:14:36.980
Name the map.

07:14:36.980 --> 07:14:37.700
Stop.

07:14:37.700 --> 07:14:38.100
Please.

07:14:39.220 --> 07:14:41.060
You know very little.

07:14:41.060 --> 07:14:42.260
We must guide you.

07:14:47.060 --> 07:14:47.700
Oh.

07:14:47.700 --> 07:14:49.140
The Mason or struggle.

07:14:51.620 --> 07:14:55.620
No.

07:15:08.660 --> 07:15:09.460
It is done.

07:15:10.420 --> 07:15:12.340
The way lies all before you.

07:15:13.140 --> 07:15:15.540
Only she remains to be found.

07:15:16.420 --> 07:15:17.700
Awaken the six.

07:15:18.660 --> 07:15:19.620
Go.

07:15:19.620 --> 07:15:20.100
Alone.

07:15:21.300 --> 07:15:31.300
No.

07:15:40.180 --> 07:15:41.380
Really don't like that.

07:15:43.940 --> 07:15:44.980
Really don't like that.

07:15:46.180 --> 07:15:50.020
For those of you who haven't played Assassin's Creed 2 and don't mind spoilers.

07:15:51.300 --> 07:15:54.260
We were in Abstergo's headquarters.

07:15:54.980 --> 07:15:59.460
And she broke us out because she was pretending to be a Templar.

07:15:59.460 --> 07:16:00.900
She's actually an assassin.

07:16:02.100 --> 07:16:04.660
And then we have just played Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

07:16:05.460 --> 07:16:07.780
Which is the sequel.

07:16:09.540 --> 07:16:14.740
And she got identified as a double crossing agent twice over.

07:16:15.780 --> 07:16:16.980
Which made no sense.

07:16:17.860 --> 07:16:19.300
Because why would she break us out?

07:16:19.540 --> 07:16:26.820
And if you want to know the real reason why Lucy is killed off in Exio's story.

07:16:26.820 --> 07:16:27.460
Oh yeah sorry.

07:16:27.460 --> 07:16:28.740
In Desmond's storyline.

07:16:28.740 --> 07:16:29.220
Shit.

07:16:29.220 --> 07:16:30.340
He's gone into shock.

07:16:30.340 --> 07:16:31.540
Put him back in the machine.

07:16:31.540 --> 07:16:32.740
It's the only way to fix this.

07:16:32.740 --> 07:16:34.180
But the Animus did this to me.

07:16:34.180 --> 07:16:35.140
Am I the expert or not?

07:16:36.260 --> 07:16:36.660
Do it.

07:16:40.740 --> 07:16:44.660
The reason why Lucy's character was killed off is because

07:16:44.740 --> 07:16:50.420
she asked for like the revenue.

07:16:52.180 --> 07:16:54.420
Not for like a payout for her voice.

07:16:54.420 --> 07:16:56.660
But for the revenue split thing that they do.

07:16:58.340 --> 07:16:59.780
I can never remember the word.

07:17:00.980 --> 07:17:03.780
Like where you get like payouts constantly.

07:17:04.500 --> 07:17:05.460
Like for your voice.

07:17:06.820 --> 07:17:08.660
And royalties.

07:17:08.660 --> 07:17:10.100
Yes royalties.

07:17:10.100 --> 07:17:13.140
She knew she was onto something.

07:17:13.140 --> 07:17:14.900
She was an Assassin's Creed 2.

07:17:14.900 --> 07:17:16.180
Then she's in a second game.

07:17:16.180 --> 07:17:17.380
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

07:17:17.940 --> 07:17:19.700
And she said royalties.

07:17:20.260 --> 07:17:22.980
And that end sequence was then created.

07:17:23.620 --> 07:17:27.300
Because at no point do the gods speak of present day issues.

07:17:27.940 --> 07:17:30.020
And if you listen to the gods words.

07:17:30.660 --> 07:17:32.420
It was like you don't understand.

07:17:32.420 --> 07:17:33.460
We need to teach you.

07:17:34.020 --> 07:17:37.540
The gods should not interact with Desmond on that level.

07:17:37.540 --> 07:17:38.260
Lore wise.

07:17:38.900 --> 07:17:42.660
And because she wanted royalties killed her.

07:17:42.660 --> 07:17:43.140
In plot.

07:17:43.140 --> 07:17:45.300
And they said yeah well we don't need you anymore.

07:17:46.340 --> 07:17:47.940
So thanks Ubisoft.

07:17:47.940 --> 07:17:50.340
Absolutely destroyed Lucy's storyline.

07:17:52.740 --> 07:17:55.860
And yeah I hope your shareholders are happy.

07:17:55.860 --> 07:17:57.300
Because you ruin it for the people.

07:17:59.140 --> 07:18:00.260
But other than that.

07:18:00.980 --> 07:18:02.980
Other than that really annoying fact.

07:18:05.300 --> 07:18:07.220
Otherwise incredibly good game.

07:18:08.740 --> 07:18:09.860
Incredibly good game.

07:18:10.820 --> 07:18:13.860
I elect to pretend that Lucy is still fully alive.

07:18:13.860 --> 07:18:16.740
And acting as an Assassin.

07:18:16.740 --> 07:18:17.540
And all of that.

07:18:17.540 --> 07:18:18.020
So yeah.

07:18:28.100 --> 07:18:30.660
Oh and the VA for Rosa passed away.

07:18:30.660 --> 07:18:31.540
I didn't know that.

07:18:39.860 --> 07:18:43.860
But yes.

07:18:43.860 --> 07:18:46.660
That is the story of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.

07:18:46.660 --> 07:18:50.100
It's absolutely 10 out of 10 game experience.

07:18:50.900 --> 07:18:58.180
If you ignore the very ending dialogue and occurrences.

07:18:59.380 --> 07:19:01.540
But that was amazing game.

07:19:01.540 --> 07:19:03.220
And I absolutely love Nerd and Abode.

07:19:04.100 --> 07:19:05.860
I'm probably going to do the Borgia towers.

07:19:05.860 --> 07:19:07.940
I don't think I'm ready to go off stream just yet.

07:19:08.900 --> 07:19:11.540
So sorry for anyone who's perishing right now.

07:19:11.540 --> 07:19:13.460
And their eyes are bulging out of their skull.

07:19:13.460 --> 07:19:16.100
Because of how much they need to sleep right now.

07:19:16.100 --> 07:19:17.540
I'm very sorry.

07:19:17.540 --> 07:19:19.860
I'm really enjoying this game.

07:19:19.860 --> 07:19:21.220
And yeah.

07:19:22.100 --> 07:19:23.780
Are you still doing the second stream?

07:19:23.780 --> 07:19:24.180
Yes.

07:19:24.180 --> 07:19:26.980
So today I was to finish the campaign mode.

07:19:26.980 --> 07:19:29.780
And tomorrow we're going to 100% this game.

07:19:29.780 --> 07:19:32.980
Because I have never 100%ed this game before.

07:19:32.980 --> 07:19:34.340
Always wanted to try.

07:19:34.340 --> 07:19:35.300
Never did it.

07:19:35.300 --> 07:19:38.900
I believe I may have 100%ed Assassin's Creed 2.

07:19:38.900 --> 07:19:39.860
Achievement wise.

07:19:41.380 --> 07:19:44.660
Which was like a nightmare trying to get all the feathers.

07:19:44.660 --> 07:19:48.020
But we can talk about that when we play it.

07:19:48.020 --> 07:19:49.220
On June.

07:19:49.940 --> 07:19:50.420
June.

07:19:50.420 --> 07:19:51.780
On October 8th.

07:19:57.780 --> 07:19:58.580
I'll keep going.

07:19:58.580 --> 07:20:00.020
I've got a couple more hours in me.

07:20:00.020 --> 07:20:00.420
Oh yeah.

07:20:00.420 --> 07:20:00.740
Damn.

07:20:00.740 --> 07:20:01.780
You got the stamina in it.

07:20:06.260 --> 07:20:06.740
Hmmmm.

07:20:07.540 --> 07:20:08.100
Yes.

07:20:10.260 --> 07:20:12.180
All the feathers took so long.

07:20:14.580 --> 07:20:16.100
Schedule set for October.

07:20:16.100 --> 07:20:18.820
So my birthday is October 10th.

07:20:19.460 --> 07:20:21.620
Which is when I will do my donathon.

07:20:21.620 --> 07:20:25.780
And for my birthday I would like to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood all over again.

07:20:26.340 --> 07:20:28.660
But I'm gonna play it utmost line.

07:20:28.660 --> 07:20:34.420
So on the 8th of October Assassin's Creed 2 campaign.

07:20:34.420 --> 07:20:41.700
then Assassin's Creed 2 again for 100% and then Brotherhood on the 10th and the 11th

07:20:41.700 --> 07:20:51.540
and then on the 12th and the 13th would be Revelations and we will complete its use storyline.

07:20:52.740 --> 07:20:57.380
I'm not very well versed in Revelations, I have played it a couple of times but I'm not as well

07:20:57.460 --> 07:21:03.700
versed so I probably can't Japanese about the best strategies for the game.

07:21:06.180 --> 07:21:12.100
Are you doing the strong new passive and you present it? I don't know, I've been looking at

07:21:12.100 --> 07:21:18.180
some ASMR challenges like the 8 hour ASMR stream challenge, maybe I might consider that although

07:21:18.180 --> 07:21:24.500
my voice breaks pretty quickly for ASMR and whispering is the most damaging thing I can do.

07:21:27.460 --> 07:21:30.260
You should watch Embers after Revelations.

07:21:34.500 --> 07:21:40.340
I would make a reminder for those days. I'll be posting my schedule like I've posted my schedule

07:21:40.340 --> 07:21:48.100
for this week um after the needy streamer overload I think it's like a two hour game

07:21:48.100 --> 07:21:56.260
question mark um I actually need to go and buy the American candy um and those European

07:21:56.580 --> 07:22:02.500
sweets because I don't buy them and then I need to like clean my desk and stuff uh because I'm

07:22:02.500 --> 07:22:13.860
doing a hand cam stream. Um Strani, if mummy goat is our mum are you the granny? Don't look into

07:22:13.860 --> 07:22:20.180
the lore too much of how velour came to be. Technically there are five children birthed from

07:22:20.180 --> 07:22:28.260
my loins. Whispering's bad for your voice but yes I may or may not need a really big pee now that I

07:22:28.260 --> 07:22:35.860
have just been aware of my bladder. I just sat on my foot uh like against well you know against what

07:22:35.860 --> 07:22:40.900
and then my brain was like oh by the way sensation I'm like ah yes yes I believe I need to pee.

07:22:41.540 --> 07:22:52.420
Oh mother mary virgin birth uh no sorry it was the reeflings doing oopsies.

07:22:53.700 --> 07:22:58.820
That is the marabout going wild that's all I'm saying. I don't know how we got it we didn't get

07:22:58.820 --> 07:23:07.460
kicked out of that convention. So I am taking drinkies of water which flows this track and

07:23:07.460 --> 07:23:15.380
then puts my hypnosis on. But yes we'll take a very quick pee break. Um I might make a second

07:23:15.380 --> 07:23:21.060
cup uh well be my third cup of tea but my second that I'll drink on stream with you. Uh I just need

07:23:21.060 --> 07:23:26.580
water and drink I actually don't need any food that those snacks really satiated me. I have been

07:23:26.580 --> 07:23:36.100
satiated I thank you for letting me eat on stream. Stream elements is how we pitch child support.

07:23:36.100 --> 07:23:41.540
Yeah I don't know what's going on. I unironically think you guys were given like so much money

07:23:41.540 --> 07:23:48.180
collectively to the girls once the tip page was up that uh you guys broke the paypal uh

07:23:49.860 --> 07:23:55.780
yeah. So thanks for giving us so much money that uh paypal is now investigating the account or

07:23:55.780 --> 07:24:01.380
something I don't know. Uh but yeah if you want to support the girls you can always buy the merch

07:24:01.380 --> 07:24:07.300
they get 100% of the earnings. None of it goes to the other and all the girls will uh say that they

07:24:07.300 --> 07:24:13.140
own the ubu market uh accounts and all that they have logins and it's all their stuff we did not

07:24:13.140 --> 07:24:20.660
touch it nothing to do with us. So yeah uh hopefully monetization on youtube stats

07:24:20.660 --> 07:24:27.540
statistics uh update because my statistics were like yeah you have 80 watch hours and I'm like

07:24:27.540 --> 07:24:34.180
are you sure about that? Are you sure youtube? Because I don't think so. All the merch is so

07:24:34.180 --> 07:24:39.540
cute. I'm so excited for the keychain to arrive and I'll do tap tap tap play some more.

07:24:46.500 --> 07:24:55.380

Thank you Francis Page for your gear programming. Thank you Alexander Prich for your Oasis team.

07:25:32.820 --> 07:25:39.540
Thank you Fabian Noel for your Oasis concert. Is it Oasis? Oasis? Is that team name? I must

07:25:39.540 --> 07:25:48.580
be team name Oasis because I don't remember any Oasis in uh Roma. Thanks adobe. Don't worry

07:25:49.540 --> 07:25:53.940
you'll reach the watchers someday. I literally already reached them and YouTube's like yeah

07:25:53.940 --> 07:25:59.620
give me like seven to eight business days to update your stats because I can apply for

07:25:59.620 --> 07:26:06.260
partnership uh monetization like right now. Well I should be able to but the stats don't say I have

07:26:06.260 --> 07:26:13.780
the watch time but I do have the watch time so uh but hopefully we can get our monetization streams

07:26:13.860 --> 07:26:17.940
and then you know all that. I have no idea how long this PayPal issue is gonna last but

07:26:19.780 --> 07:26:23.300
you guys gave literally and ironically gave so much money that they can't burst.

07:26:25.700 --> 07:26:34.980
I have like 10 watchers alone. I miss adobe flash player. Binding up Isaac started on it but I never

07:26:34.980 --> 07:26:38.980
actually played it at that stage. I only played it like a couple moves back.

07:26:51.060 --> 07:26:57.780
I like the enemies in this game as well. Have you like made them multiplayer enemies or like

07:26:57.780 --> 07:26:59.780
uh

07:27:03.460 --> 07:27:12.820
I like as well uh the plot line that love Volpe is so like I know it's you Nicolo I know it's you

07:27:12.820 --> 07:27:17.140
and like all these things coincidentally happen at the same time. I like stories like that

07:27:17.140 --> 07:27:24.420
because it's like no no you're wrong please but thank goodness we did the no swim part that was

07:27:24.420 --> 07:27:30.500
awful grabbed a poor man's horse ran up a side of a building a few times and failed and then like

07:27:30.500 --> 07:27:37.540
dived across this like bean of rope. Would you consider playing Binding of Isaac on stream?

07:27:37.540 --> 07:27:45.540
Oh boy you're in for a treat. In November the uh official multiplayer for a Binding of Isaac

07:27:45.540 --> 07:27:52.580
goes live and I would absolutely love to play with you guys. Um we will be streaming that game often

07:27:52.580 --> 07:27:59.700
I am uh addicted to it. I've not before anyone asks have you done Dead God? No I've not done Dead

07:27:59.700 --> 07:28:07.940
God. I currently am at like uh I think it's like 1,000 of 1% and it's stop that's where I'm at on

07:28:07.940 --> 07:28:13.540
one fail. I have absolutely nothing on the two other save files but uh it definitely is going to be a

07:28:13.540 --> 07:28:20.020
consistently multiplayer streamed game from bits like I'll do like 12 hour runs for the multiplayer

07:28:20.020 --> 07:28:25.620
game of that week and then like we'll pick a different multiplayer game type thing um would you

07:28:25.620 --> 07:28:38.660
be fantastic? Ooh Binding of Isaac is hardly it is a randomized kind of dungeon crawler but there's

07:28:38.660 --> 07:28:45.700
a lot of interesting story in the background of it um I really enjoy it I actually want to make a

07:28:45.700 --> 07:28:52.980
review on this game Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and as well as Binding of Isaac and Call of the

07:28:52.980 --> 07:28:59.060
Lamb basically I want to make like real game reviews but only on games that I think are 10

07:28:59.060 --> 07:29:06.180
out of 10 because I can't stop yapping about them and like bringing up like how flawless the uh in

07:29:06.180 --> 07:29:12.180
rewarding like the gameplay is and how they've like done the tutorials or what aspects have just

07:29:12.180 --> 07:29:18.420
really stood out like I just really like anything would be so nice to try it like um as much as we

07:29:18.420 --> 07:29:24.340
all like to dog on like video game journalists and stuff like it is definitely uh thank you

07:29:26.340 --> 07:29:32.260
please keep yapping I enjoy it if you like the Binding of Isaac I highly recommend Noeta I have

07:29:32.260 --> 07:29:38.980
never heard of Noeta uh is it like Pixley like Isaac as well

07:29:41.220 --> 07:29:47.860
from how you talking here would be awesome at giving some game reviews uh I've got it as a

07:29:47.860 --> 07:29:54.980
donathon like reward it would take a lot of effort though like I definitely think after my

07:29:54.980 --> 07:30:00.420
donathon is finished I'll probably have a few shorter games back to back and the reason for

07:30:00.420 --> 07:30:07.620
that is because I'll be like working on rewards um I I literally want to like fire the rewards as

07:30:07.620 --> 07:30:17.380
soon as possible like once it's done and like all of that um Noeta runs can go for hours oh Isaac

07:30:17.380 --> 07:30:24.660
runs are like one hour sometimes if you get really good items and stuff you can be wrapped up in 30

07:30:24.740 --> 07:30:33.380
minutes with Isaac um yeah start each review with a five-minute hypnosis section where you turn

07:30:33.380 --> 07:30:37.860
your your hypnosis you will like this game that's so good you will like this game you will like this

07:30:37.860 --> 07:30:46.900
game you will like this game have you considered collab of girls playing battle ground three

07:30:47.380 --> 07:30:54.980
what's bg oh no what's bg battleground why do I think battleground

07:30:56.820 --> 07:31:00.660
boulder wait the boulders gate is multiplayer I've never played it

07:31:02.180 --> 07:31:06.180
what did I've never played it I didn't realize it was multiplayer

07:31:07.300 --> 07:31:16.500
big bouldies gate right so we have just done it we are officially goodness gravy we have a lot

07:31:16.500 --> 07:31:22.580
money on our persons this is a bit more money than uh I think you actually need it so it's

07:31:22.580 --> 07:31:28.020
given capitalism it's so it's given capitalism so put it back and invest in properties and stuff

07:31:28.020 --> 07:31:33.380
I am going to send the birds away sorry I'm going to send the recruits away to level up a little bit

07:31:34.420 --> 07:31:38.660
I'm going to do a peep I'm going to make a cup of tea so a three-minute break please

07:31:39.620 --> 07:31:46.580
heavily recommend that you um you know get up walk around stretch your legs and do a little pp

07:31:46.580 --> 07:31:58.100
as well um and we are going to do the borja towers next and then maybe possibly um

07:32:00.660 --> 07:32:08.260

07:32:08.260 --> 07:32:14.900
those last two recruits can go on I mean I've got a oh you're not strong enough so I'll send you

07:32:14.900 --> 07:32:20.340
on a mission on your own and then for level two I will send you on a level one mission because I

07:32:20.340 --> 07:32:25.540
really don't want anyone to perish he I know you could go up on boulders gate that's so cool

07:32:26.820 --> 07:32:32.180
um yes I will definitely look into boulders gate collab I would need to research the game before

07:32:32.180 --> 07:32:38.340
I play because I really don't know what it's all about um okay I am going to go pee pee because

07:32:38.340 --> 07:32:42.660
