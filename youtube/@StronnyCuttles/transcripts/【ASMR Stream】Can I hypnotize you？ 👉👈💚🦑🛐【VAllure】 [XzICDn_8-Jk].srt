1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,780
shh shh shh shh shh shh shh

2
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,780
there, there

3
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,780
it's all gonna be okay

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:44,780
we're gonna have some fun together, okay?

5
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:54,780
shh, shh, shh, shh

6
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:05,780
so, a little birdie told me

7
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:13,780
you might be interested in a certain cuttlefish

8
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:20,780
trying her best to see if she can put you under

9
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,780
is that true?

10
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,780
I just need to take it nice and slow, okay?

11
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,780
there's no rush

12
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,780
I'm not doing anything just yet, okay?

13
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,780
shh

14
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,780
it's good to take things slow

15
00:01:52,780 --> 00:02:01,780
you do seem very interested

16
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,780
in what I might be able to offer you before

17
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,780
and that's okay

18
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,780
curiosity is good

19
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,780
and I like when you're curious

20
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,780
so why don't you stay with me a little while?

21
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:40,780
I want it to go through some very interesting talking points

22
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,780
and it's okay if you don't have a little

23
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:57,780
and in fact, I might even urge you to do so

24
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:08,780
you may find yourself on the other side of the stream

25
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,780
and you'll know you'll have fun with me

26
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,780
you may not remember all the details, but that's okay

27
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:29,780
I just need to talk over a few things first, okay?

28
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:36,780
you see, hypnosis can be very fun

29
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,780
if both participants make it fun, okay?

30
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,780
so worry now, my dear refling

31
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,780
there's no lasting effects because of the stream, okay?

32
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,780
it won't affect your consciousness or anything

33
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,780
so you put all those worries to bed

34
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,780
okay?

35
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:20,780
I just need you to do something really simple, okay?

36
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,780
just look into my eyes for now

37
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,780
that's all you have to do

38
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:40,780
just by doing a small little task of giving you

39
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:49,780
you're participating voluntarily into absorption

40
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,780
so it's okay to focus on my eyes

41
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,780
the swirls are nice, aren't they?

42
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,780
would you like me to get closer to you?

43
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,780
let me get closer

44
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,780
you can really see it now, can ya?

45
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,780
good

46
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:27,780
but that's not the only thing I want you to focus on

47
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:35,780
see, my hair can have a pattern about it too

48
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:46,780
so you can focus, focus, focus as much as you please

49
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:57,780
and then you can listen to my voice as it gates you slowly

50
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:06,780
you don't have to do anything at this point in time, okay?

51
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,780
whether you're sitting or lying down watching

52
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,780
you're doing really good

53
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,780
hmm

54
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,780
you're doing really well actually

55
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:35,780
some people describe my look as a little tactileizing

56
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:43,780
hopefully I look nice for ya

57
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,780
yeah, okay

58
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,780
I wonder if you feel a sensation inside ya

59
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:04,780
is it familiar or is it unfamiliar?

60
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,780
what if we work on it together?

61
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:14,780
that funny feeling that's inside your tummy right now

62
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,780
it's kind of like butterflies

63
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,780
is it excitement for what comes next?

64
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,780
that's okay if it is

65
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:39,780
in fact, I would encourage you to keep that sensation

66
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:52,780
and we can spread it over your body until it reaches your mind

67
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,780
oh, there, there

68
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,780
should be a slow sensation

69
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,780
spreading up your chest, your neck

70
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:13,780
past your eyes and over your mind

71
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,780
it could be described as almost tingly

72
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:34,780
and the thought of fading had never came across your mind

73
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:42,780
and now it feels like your mind is switching off

74
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,780
no need to worry though or think

75
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:55,780
it's just me and you

76
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:03,780
and you can let out a big sigh

77
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,780
what would it be like if you went under with me?

78
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:16,780
if you went deeper and deeper with me

79
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:24,780
I think it would be enjoyable that you'd like it

80
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:32,780
I think it would be worth every second being under me

81
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:44,780
it's okay, you can let it happen

82
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:49,780
deeper and deeper your thoughts are leaving

83
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,780
with only my voice remaining in your head

84
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:04,780
just look at me and forget

85
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:13,780
all you need to know is that you're safe and you're loved

86
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,780
and by the time I'm finished with you

87
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,780
you'll already want to go again

88
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:32,780
don't, don't, don't you go

89
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:38,780
just let whatever happens happen

90
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,780
shh, shh, shh, shh

91
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:56,780
you, you, you, you, you

92
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,780
no, some people can get hung up on worrying

93
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,780
that follow commands or no, but I'll reassure you

94
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:22,380
you don't have to do anything. I think I'd like to make the request that you listen into

95
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:38,700
me. I do like the idea of suggesting things there. I want to see you ignore the outside

96
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:56,220
world so to speak. It's just you and me. And sooner or later you may faint that the

97
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:09,020
pleasure that is being under someone else's suggestion. And that's okay. You may learn

98
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:19,580
that you enjoy it, that you were so absorbed in me and wanted you, that you would like it

99
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:31,740
again and again and again. For now, however, if you're overthinking,

100
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:45,980
why don't you just pretend I'm in control? I wouldn't do anything bad in fact.

101
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:57,820
I want to focus on relaxing, yeah. I want to serve you. Is that okay?

102
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,620
Hey.

103
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:16,460
You see, some things I can do are so basic, like patting over your ears.

104
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:29,980
You can hear me doing it there. And I just want you to be able to enjoy yourself

105
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,380
wholeheartedly and your interest.

106
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:46,300
I just want to blow it to your ear.

107
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:14,300
And I can tap a different object for you.

108
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:41,820
Because while you're under with me, you can enjoy yourself.

109
00:14:44,300 --> 00:15:11,300
I won't judge you for what you like, in fact, I would recommend that you be yourself fully free from judgment or embarrassment or shyness to do what you please.

110
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:42,300
You can be vulnerable, okay? You can. And it's okay.

111
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:57,300
You deserve this kind of relaxation. You deserve this kind of downtime.

112
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:13,300
And you're allowed to enjoy yourself.

113
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm not doing anything scary to you, not while you're under, because I want to care for you and look after you.

114
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:52,300
And it's okay if you don't show it to others, but for now, this can be between me and you.

115
00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Maybe I could change your thinking a little. Would you like that?

116
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:26,300
If you would associate common things with me, I need to be careful though. I do like mind corruption, but I never want to go too far.

117
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:42,300
No, I need to be careful. You're delicate when you're in a state like this, and that's okay.

118
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:53,300
So why don't we start really small with association?

119
00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:20,300
Why not with all these relaxing sounds, these ASMR triggers? You associate them with me, even if it's a little flash in the moment, just at the back of your mind.

120
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:43,300
And you just say to yourself, Stroni does that. That thought alone makes me very happy. You do want to make me happy, right?

121
00:18:50,300 --> 00:19:19,300
Yes, I think so. I think the idea of me encapsulating your mind makes me incredibly happy.

122
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:47,300
There, there. I feel very switched on to achieve my goal with you.

123
00:19:47,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Thinking about you now, looking at me with such a blank expression, ready for a new sentence to pass my lips.

124
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:26,300
I welcome your full attention. I welcome your good behavior.

125
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:37,300
I welcome and accept every little part of you.

126
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Okay. Just as you equally welcome my instructions, and you welcome my behaviors towards you and my commands.

127
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:26,300
It's funny how someone could fall into a chance given the right words or phrases, isn't it, little one?

128
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Will I tell you about your options if you'd like to dream more with me?

129
00:21:40,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Did you know that there's a thing called a clicker? And I could, in theory, get one and make you drop into a trance state really quick.

130
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:25,300
You'd be alert one moment and the next, completely made to play with. That is a lot of power to give one girl, isn't it?

131
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Yes. But you can tell by my voice that I want to. I want to do it to you, to train you, to see how damn bad you can be.

132
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:21,300
It doesn't rather nice making you like putty in my hands, to handle you with such love and care while you're in the palm of my hand.

133
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:44,300
There, there. I think you're quite suited for the blank bliss. Or maybe that's just my opinion.

134
00:23:44,300 --> 00:24:07,300
I'm glad you don't resist much. Let's keep it that way.

135
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:34,300
I like the idea of you falling and falling fast. Or should I say dropping? It suits you. You should come and play with me more often.

136
00:24:34,300 --> 00:25:01,300
I'd like to play with you more. I have some words I'd like to repeat, okay? And I want you to consider them. I think it all makes sense.

137
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:30,300
Okay? For now, we'll start easy. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax. Relax.

138
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Relax.

139
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Relax.

140
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Relax.

141
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:55,300
And you can let go. Let go. Let go.

142
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go.

143
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:34,480
you can go deeper, deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper

144
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:46,520
deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper

145
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,520
deeper

146
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,520
deeper

147
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,520
shhhh

148
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,520
shhhh

149
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,520
shhhh

150
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,520
shhhh

151
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,520
there

152
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
the trance

153
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
trance

154
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,520
trance

155
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
into trance

156
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
trance

157
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
into trance

158
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
and then last

159
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
obey

160
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
obey

161
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
obey

162
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
obey

163
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
obey

164
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
obey

165
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
obey

166
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
oh there, there

167
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I think that got you again

168
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
so what's happening now?

169
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
well

170
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
nothing really happens now

171
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,520
you're just

172
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
adorably

173
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
under my spell

174
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
and I wouldn't have it any other way

175
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
so come here

176
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
trance

177
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
can you just let me shower you

178
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,520
with appreciation for being so brave, okay?

179
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,520
you've done some nerve of your cumbersome for me

180
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
you need to be rewarded

181
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
for this kind of behavior

182
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,520
I have to instill it in you

183
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,520
that you want more

184
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
deep down

185
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
I'll make you crave more

186
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
whether that's now or later

187
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,520
it won't be your choice if you pursue more

188
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
if not

189
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,520
it's okay

190
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
oh

191
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
while we're on the subject

192
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
why don't you go deeper for me

193
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
my voice will go with you

194
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
so don't worry

195
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:06,520
let's get you into the most malleable state I can

196
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
now

197
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
it's time to fully relax you

198
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
and don't worry

199
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
I'll bring you back later

200
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
near the end

201
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
but for now

202
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,520
it's time to just relax with me

203
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
and listen to me ramble

204
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,520
and try to put you to sleep

205
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
while you're under

206
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
ooh now that would be fun

207
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,520
but it's okay

208
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,520
you can listen to the sounds I'm making

209
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,520
or you can listen

210
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
to the

211
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
background music

212
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
and

213
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
ambience

214
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,520
I give you full permission to relax

215
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
and to let yourself cool

216
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
cool

217
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,520
you're allowed to enjoy the things that make you happy

218
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
and if that's me

219
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,520
putting you under my spell

220
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,520
then I am very

221
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,520
honored

222
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
and then

223
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,520
and then you don't need to resist anymore

224
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,520
you can let those walls come down

225
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
okay

226
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,520
just enjoy yourself

227
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,520
as you please

228
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
unapologetically you

229
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,520
that's all I want from you

230
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
and then

231
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
right there

232
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,520
my little thrall

233
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
so

234
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,520
you think my eyes are pretty

235
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I'm glad

236
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
there there

237
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,520
just give your ear some cleaning

238
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
hey

239
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
you're so good right now

240
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
you're doing really well okay

241
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
so don't overthink

242
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
don't think at all

243
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
okay

244
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,520
just zone out with me

245
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
let me be your guide

246
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,520
even if that's putting you in a trance

247
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
or a relaxed state

248
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
yeah

249
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
don't worry

250
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
I won't do this for too long

251
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,520
and I'll bring you back gently when it's day

252
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,520
but it's just not quite day yet

253
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,520
I'd like to

254
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,520
tease you a little more

255
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:52,520
maybe see what kind of fun we could have in the future

256
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,520
because it doesn't have to stop here

257
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
you see

258
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,520
I'm made in the future

259
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,520
I want you to temporarily forget your name

260
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,520
and I'll replace it with a new one

261
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I'd only make it last roughly two hours

262
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,520
and if I'm successful

263
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I think it would spur me on to do more

264
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,520
I don't want to corrupt you in an evil sense

265
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:54,520
unless you'd consider my kind of main corruption evil

266
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,520
I think I'd like to do it

267
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,520
very slowly

268
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
take over your mind

269
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
session by session

270
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
until all that remains

271
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
is your devotion

272
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
to strony

273
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
yeah

274
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
that sends one to me

275
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,520
because you did something to me reflex

276
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,520
at first I wanted to be evil towards humanity

277
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,520
to corrupt them

278
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,520
and end them

279
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
but now

280
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
I want pure

281
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,520
main broken

282
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
devotion

283
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,520
no other will make you as satisfied as me

284
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,520
but that's evil doing that to you

285
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
that needs to stay

286
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,520
me

287
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,520
do we have that time together do you think?

288
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,520
could I be so devious

289
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,520
and do that to you

290
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:55,520
oh maybe just maybe

291
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,520
and then we truly

292
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,520
have eternity together

293
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,520
because I'll always be a part of you

294
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,520
in the back of your mind

295
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,520
influencing your thoughts

296
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,520
at first it might be startling

297
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,520
or scary

298
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,520
but I'll make you grieve me

299
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,520
do you understand?

300
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,520
you will want strony

301
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,520
and I will answer

302
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,520
I'll be there

303
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,520
and you'll know deep down

304
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,520
everything I want you to do

305
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,520
because that's how well trained you'll become with me

306
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,520
if you think you can go deeper

307
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,520
you have my permission

308
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,520
but if not

309
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,520
just relax again

310
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
shh

311
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,520
just be gay to yourself

312
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
be gentle

313
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,520
and spend the same with me to the villain

314
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm just going to try and relax you

315
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,520
just a little bit

316
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,520
and I'll play with your ears

317
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,520
make unique noises

318
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
talk directly to you

319
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,520
just a little bit

320
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
there

321
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,520
there, there, there

322
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,520
I'm not sure if I need to say anything else to you

323
00:44:48,520 --> 00:45:04,520
or if we should just blissfully focus on the ASMR while you're under my control

324
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,520
I don't think I need to do anything else to make you maine

325
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:18,520
that's been a 45 minutes

326
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,520
and there shouldn't be a shred of resistance from you

327
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
so it's okay

328
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,520
you can close your eyes if you like

329
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,520
they may be feeling quite heavy

330
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,520
even if you can't see me

331
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,520
you're still made under my spell

332
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:58,520
my little perfect thrall

333
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,520
shh

334
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,520
you can let out a big sigh

335
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,520
and while you do it

336
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,520
let your muscles relax

337
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,520
unclench your jaw

338
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:39,520
unfurl your eyebrows

339
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:49,520
let your shoulders relax into themselves

340
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,520
you're a very high strong man

341
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,520
but that's okay

342
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:10,520
I'll try to undo that with the precious thing that we have together

343
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,520
it's okay

344
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,520
you can soothe yourself

345
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,520
as I make all these small noises

346
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,520
shh, it's gonna be okay

347
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,520
everything works out in the end

348
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,520
and you can't deny it either

349
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,520
or else how did you find me?

350
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,520
one way or another

351
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,520
I know you'll make it

352
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,520
and you'll make me proud

353
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,520
but more importantly

354
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,520
you'll make yourself proud

355
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,520
okay?

356
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,520
you're not in a race with anyone

357
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,520
you are

358
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,520
you can take life

359
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,520
as fast

360
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,520
or as slow as you like

361
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,520
and you're allowed to pat yourself on the back

362
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,520
for all the hidden things you do

363
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,520
that no one else is gonna see

364
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,520
be as kind to yourself

365
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,520
as I would be to you

366
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,520
I want you to be a cheerleader for yourself

367
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,520
and advocate for yourself

368
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:34,520
if that voice is secretly made on the back of your mind

369
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,520
then I assure you

370
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,520
I will brainwash you in every single way I can

371
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,520
to make that happen

372
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,520
and you know I'll do it

373
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,520
because I know what your subconscious wants

374
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,520
what the desires are

375
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:10,520
and I am the one who fulfills those desires

376
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,520
to be so shameless with you

377
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,520
to give what the mind seeks

378
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,520
that in itself is a blessing

379
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,520
shh

380
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,520
you keep relaxing though

381
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,520
I just wanted to say

382
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,520
that I'm so happy we can spend time together like this

383
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,520
even if your mind isn't fully there

384
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,520
you'll know deep down

385
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,520
we had a good time together

386
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:18,520
and you made me very happy

387
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:42,520
sometimes I see the others can be trained to be happy

388
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:52,520
but just maybe

389
00:51:52,520 --> 00:52:05,520
I would make me happy if you wouldn't talk in the other things in life

390
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,520
but how do I say it without saying it

391
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,520
my little girl

392
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,520
that's the question

393
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:37,520
I'm very happy when you get excited

394
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,520
I'm very happy when you get relief

395
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:57,520
I'm very happy when you're happy like that

396
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:05,520
and your body is done what it needed to do

397
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,520
shh

398
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,520
stay deep, stay under

399
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,520
shh

400
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,520
shh

401
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,520
shh

402
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,520
okay

403
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,520
that's about it

404
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,520
just gentle, lay it to the

405
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:36,520
gentle, gentle

406
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:48,520
just trying to do the same thing to each of your ears

407
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
like I said before

408
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,520
I give you permission to relax

409
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:14,520
I give you permission to enjoy what you want to enjoy

410
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,520
shh

411
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:29,520
relax, relax, relax

412
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,520
let it go, let it go, let it go

413
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:48,520
deeper, deeper, deeper

414
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:58,520
trans, trans, trans

415
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:09,520
obey, obey, obey

416
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,520
shh

417
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:31,520
relax, relax, relax

418
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:43,520
let it go, let it go, let it go

419
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:54,520
deeper, deeper, deeper

420
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:02,520
trans, trans, trans

421
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:15,520
obey, obey, obey

422
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:22,520
let it go

423
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,520
shh

424
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,520
shh

425
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:52,520
isn't it fun giving out your control to a girl, huh?

426
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,520
how good that you're so willing

427
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:08,520
some people aren't very suggestive and that's okay

428
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,520
if you struggle, that's perfectly normal

429
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:22,520
but when I have you, I feel selfish

430
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,520
like I don't want you to go

431
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,520
and I don't want to let go of you

432
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
not while you're like this

433
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:45,520
so malleable, so easy to manipulate into my bidding

434
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,520
so bad, I think that makes me selfish

435
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,520
to somehow ask even more from you

436
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,520
while you're under

437
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,520
shh

438
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
it's okay

439
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,520
it's okay

440
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:37,520
do you secretly encourage me?

441
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,520
tell me to continue to be selfish

442
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,520
you're brave for giving me such permission

443
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,520
when you don't know the full extent of what I want to do to you

444
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:01,520
you might be sparing on the wrong person

445
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:12,520
because this color fish is about to get really invested

446
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,520
in her thrall

447
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,520
shh

448
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,520
let yourself relax

449
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,520
we still have time, okay?

450
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
so don't worry

451
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,520
let's enjoy ourselves

452
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,520
as much as we can

453
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,520
no, I could never hurt you

454
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,520
I never would

455
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,520
only corrupt you

456
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,520
take your mind

457
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,520
and make it to my bidding

458
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,520
but I'm definitely not

459
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,520
I don't have the most common objectives

460
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,520
that others may have while they're in control of you

461
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:50,520
your mind isn't the only thing I want empty by the end of the session

462
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,520
shh

463
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,520
but relax

464
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:14,520
relax, relax, relax, relax

465
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:21,520
I wouldn't be so devious

466
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,520
to give such an order

467
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,520
even though

468
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,520
we both might want it

469
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,520
this is why I like it slow

470
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,520
a very slow

471
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,520
almost painful

472
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,520
almost robbing burn

473
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:59,520
of how slow I want to corrupt you

474
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,520
I wanted to take you by surprise

475
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,520
you think you're in control

476
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,520
and then by the

477
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,520
a freeze

478
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,520
the snap of my fingers

479
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,520
maybe a clicker

480
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,520
and your mind

481
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,520
to do with what I please

482
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,520
that's the plan

483
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:45,520
oh, you remember the plan when you wake up, I wonder

484
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:51,520
but now, stay deep down for me

485
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,520
shh, deep, deep, deep down

486
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,520
with this call of it

487
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,520
deep, deep, deep

488
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,520
they are

489
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,520
good

490
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,520
very, very good

491
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:30,520
I like when you behave

492
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,520
it makes me want to praise you

493
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,520
and tell you what a good boy you are for me

494
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:48,520
and now I love that blank expression on your face

495
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:54,520
that I could just whip it right now

496
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:01,520
and then put my hand under your chin

497
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,520
and hold it

498
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,520
so you look at me

499
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,520
and you're paralyzed

500
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,520
nothing else matters

501
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,520
just scrawny

502
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,520
and what she's doing

503
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:27,520
to my mate and body

504
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,520
for me

505
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,520
good boy

506
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:47,520
you have made me very happy

507
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,520
shh

508
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,520
am I going to path love dream you?

509
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,520
I've thought about that

510
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:08,520
about how I would do it

511
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,520
but you're so silly

512
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,520
I'm already doing it

513
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,520
my voice

514
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,520
the background ambience

515
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,520
the way I look, my eyes, my hair

516
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,520
it's too late

517
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,520
it's already begun

518
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:41,520
I just need to establish the behavior next

519
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:46,520
of what I want to see from you

520
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:55,520
I'll do some real big training soon, okay?

521
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,520
okay

522
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,520
there, there

523
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,520
shh

524
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,520
shh

525
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,520
I've wondered

526
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,520
when I start making videos for you to consume

527
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:50,520
well, I won't make the trigger to pick your name

528
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,520
but I think

529
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,520
a variety

530
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,520
would be very nice

531
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,520
oh yeah

532
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,520
would you gaitly go deeper?

533
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,520
shh

534
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,520
because I think you can

535
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,520
just for me

536
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,520
okay

537
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:46,520
does it feel like you can go any deeper?

538
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:53,520
do I need to piss you further than you've ever gone before?

539
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,520
or

540
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,520
I can try, you know

541
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,520
you want to descend with a skull fist

542
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:25,520
take a deep breath and a big exhale

543
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,520
let your body relax into yourself

544
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:50,520
let your mind go blank

545
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:57,520
all you need to think about is Strony

546
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,520
and Strony's voice

547
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,520
that's all

548
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:15,520
and we can imagine together in your mind

549
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:24,520
that you and I are swimming together in the water

550
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:32,520
we're on the surface and I've got your hand

551
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,520
I'm reassuring you

552
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,520
and we both take one big breath together

553
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,520
and under the water we go

554
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,520
I'll gait you

555
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:00,520
with my voice, with my body, with my mind, I will look after you

556
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:07,520
as you go deeper and deeper and deeper

557
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,520
and there's no worries or anxieties or stress

558
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,520
because you know I have you

559
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:24,520
so do it

560
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,520
go deeper and obey

561
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,520
shh

562
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,520
no thoughts, only Strony

563
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,520
shh

564
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,520
you are doing so well

565
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,520
I'm so happy

566
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,520
I'm so proud

567
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,520
I'm very excited

568
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:25,520
to see just how far I can take you

569
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,520
down this little sinkhole together

570
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,520
good little thrall

571
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,520
very, very good

572
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,520
shh

573
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,520
you're doing amazing

574
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,520
you've made me very happy

575
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,520
going along with what I see

576
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,520
today is high command

577
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,520
I'd like you to keep that up

578
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,520
just a little bit longer

579
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,520
shh

580
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,520
shh

581
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,520
there

582
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,520
shh

583
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,520
are your eyes feeling heavy?

584
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,520
I think they might be

585
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,520
I'm not sure

586
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,520
do you have enough brain power

587
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,520
to know if you're tired, darling?

588
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,520
yeah

589
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,520
if you need to close your eyes, you can

590
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,520
my voice will still be here to gait you

591
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:20,520
as we get deeper into the water

592
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,520
the light becomes less, doesn't it?

593
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,520
but I'm here

594
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,520
I'll gait you

595
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,520
with my sense, my voice

596
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,520
there will be no silence

597
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,520
when you're with me

598
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,520
there will be no silence

599
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,520
when you're under my control

600
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:59,520
at all times I have you and you are safe

601
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,520
you know that strong equals safety

602
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,520
so put to rest

603
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,520
any worries and wars

604
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,520
it's just me and you

605
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,520
you're relaxed

606
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,520
you're under

607
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,520
and most of all

608
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,520
you obey

609
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,520
okay

610
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,520
there, there

611
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,520
shh

612
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,520
shh

613
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,520
it's okay

614
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,520
everything's gonna be okay

615
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,520
it always works out at the end for you

616
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,520
enjoy my sweet embrace

617
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,520
you can return to me at any time

618
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,520
I won't judge

619
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,520
only encourage

620
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,520
it's okay

621
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:10,520
I want you to have the courage to pursue what you enjoy

622
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,520
and if that's giving up control to me

623
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,520
good

624
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,520
if that's relaxing with me

625
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,520
good

626
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,520
there, there

627
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,520
you're doing fantastic

628
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,520
you really are

629
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,520
okay

630
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,520
can you hear the bubbles in the water?

631
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:06,520
can you imagine us swimming together

632
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,520
having fun

633
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,520
even though there's darkness around us

634
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,520
you still see my eyes

635
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,520
they're lighting up

636
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,520
so you can't miss me

637
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:32,520
can you feel the warmth of my hand

638
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,520
as we hold hands while we swim

639
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:48,520
it's lovely being in the deep with me

640
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:59,520
I'll look after you, I'll guide you

641
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,520
there

642
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,520
shh

643
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:28,520
it's gonna be okay

644
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,520
it's all gonna be okay

645
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,520
I promise you

646
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,520
I like swimming with you

647
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,520
you know I do

648
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,520
you can hear in my voice

649
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,520
that I'm already eager to do it more

650
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,520
but as I said before

651
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:18,520
if you're adorable, don't let's breathe for God

652
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:23,520
this needs to be slow

653
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,520
almost painfully slow

654
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:37,520
but it will be the good kind, the frustrated kind

655
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:42,520
and when you finally get your reward

656
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,520
it'll all pay off

657
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,520
the question is

658
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:57,520
do you have enough patience for me?

659
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:00,520
shh

660
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,520
they're there

661
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,520
you obey

662
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,520
you turn

663
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,520
and you keep me happy

664
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,520
when you go deep with me

665
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,520
they're there

666
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,520
shh

667
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,520
you have my permission to relax

668
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,520
and you have my permission

669
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,520
to enjoy yourself all day

670
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,520
shh

671
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,520
I had no idea

672
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,520
how well you were going to do

673
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:57,520
but you've exceeded my expectations

674
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,520
you really have

675
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,520
so I'm very happy and proud with you

676
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,520
simultaneously

677
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,520
okay

678
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,520
okay, okay, okay

679
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:33,520
you are exceptional

680
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,520
you know that

681
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,520
extraordinary

682
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,520
extraordinary

683
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,520
where have you been?

684
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:52,520
I wanted to do this to you for a long time

685
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:57,520
and I think we can officially say

686
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,520
this slow burn is in our head

687
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,520
what do you think?

688
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,520
well, I get ready to do more than you said

689
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,520
I think I should

690
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,520
and very slowly

691
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,520
keep pushing you further and further

692
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,520
into the direction I want you

693
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:32,520
because I know you never want to disappoint me

694
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,520
no

695
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:42,520
when you do fantastic listening

696
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,520
going deep

697
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,520
relaxing, obeying

698
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,520
very, very good

699
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:07,520
but I think I'm going to have to slowly bring you up again

700
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:14,520
but we need to take it very gently

701
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,520
okay

702
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,520
it'll be slow, really slow

703
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:27,520
and when you wake up

704
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:32,520
your mind may be a little hazy

705
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,520
okay

706
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:37,520
that's perfectly natural

707
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:42,520
it all may come back to you or it may not

708
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,520
and that's alright

709
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,520
I'm going to get upwards

710
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,520
to three

711
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,520
and on the number three

712
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:01,520
you will wake up

713
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,520
okay

714
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,520
don't worry

715
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,520
I've got you

716
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,520
it's okay

717
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,520
everything's gonna be okay

718
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,520
just imagine us holding hands

719
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,520
swimming in the deep together

720
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,520
we're at the bottom

721
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,520
and then we need to go up together

722
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,520
follow the sound of my voice

723
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,520
look for my eyes

724
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,520
as you slowly come up

725
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:09,520
that sensation of how heavy your body is

726
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,520
it's retracting

727
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,520
but by then I become smaller

728
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,520
slowly moving back towards your stomach

729
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,520
okay

730
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:32,520
because remember you had butterflies in your stomach

731
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,520
and they're getting smaller now

732
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,520
and as it gathers

733
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:47,520
your body and mind begin to lift and float

734
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,520
one

735
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:58,520
you're noticing as we swim

736
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,520
a blue hue returns to us

737
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,520
it's easier to see me now

738
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:13,520
and your thoughts are quiet but they're back again

739
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:20,520
and you're aware that I'm directly talking to you

740
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:26,520
you're aware that we had a session together

741
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:31,520
you're still not quite back though

742
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,520
and that's okay

743
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:38,520
we need to bring you up

744
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,520
up

745
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:47,520
up a few more times

746
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,520
you're doing great

747
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,520
I assure you

748
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:58,520
you keep coming back to me okay

749
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,520
just slow and steady

750
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,520
there's no rush

751
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,520
but your thoughts are definitely becoming their own again

752
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,520
and that's good

753
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,520
I really am

754
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,520
too

755
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,520
it's a lot later as we swim up

756
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,520
the water feels warmer as well

757
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,520
you can see all of me now

758
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,520
and the surrounding area too

759
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,520
you're more alert

760
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,520
you're more aware of your situation

761
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,520
and you can see me

762
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,520
and my eyes

763
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:59,520
but they don't have the effect of putting you under

764
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,520
no

765
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:05,520
you recognize me

766
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:10,520
as giving you a very pleasurable experience

767
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:17,520
make sure to remember that for me darlin' okay

768
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:27,520
that heavy feeling is lifting almost completely

769
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,520
it was like there was a weight on you that entire day

770
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,520
I've been no harm came to you

771
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,520
three

772
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,520
wake up sleepyhead

773
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,520
hi

774
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,520
are you okay?

775
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,520
did you enjoy that?

776
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,520
hi

777
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:01,520
hi baby

778
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:05,520
did you enjoy that?

779
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,520
my little cutie-buddy

780
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,520
hello

781
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,520
hello my little sweetheart

782
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,520
wait wait wait I still have some more aftercare okay

783
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,520
I need to make sure you're okay

784
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,520
okay

785
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,520
you don't need to worry alright

786
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:46,520
now I know sometimes it can be a little scary

787
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:50,520
realizing that you may or may not have dissociated for quite a while

788
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:55,520
but don't worry it was only an hour and a half

789
01:32:56,520 --> 01:33:02,520
if you made a half a star so don't worry not that much time has passed

790
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:09,520
I'm just gonna do some ASMR as a form of aftercare as I love you

791
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,520
but it has been less than two hours so don't worry about time

792
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:19,520
if you are a warrior about time

793
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,520
it's been an hour and a half darlin' okay

794
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,520
and you did really well like seriously you did really well

795
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,520
I'm like halo fuckin' bright

796
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,520
let me give you a kiss

797
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:48,520
now I did see that there wasn't any lasting effects because of this stream

798
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,520
and I told the truth okay

799
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:59,520
I told the truth there's no lasting effects on the stream okay

800
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:05,520
but there may or may not be lasting influence and that's different

801
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,520
lasting influence is different okay

802
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,520
an effect and an influence are two separate things okay so please don't worry

803
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,520
but I may have given you some influence

804
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,520
but it's good okay it's the good kind so don't worry about it

805
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,520
I got you covered

806
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,520
so please don't worry

807
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,520
I promise it's like a night

808
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,520
I promise it's a good night

809
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,520
okay

810
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,520
but yeah

811
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,520
I'm so only

812
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,520
did you like the hair?

813
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,520
I'm so glad

814
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,520
I'm going to get three different hair toggles

815
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,520
no I'm not hypnotizing anyone

816
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,520
but I'm going to get slow, medium and fast

817
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,520
so when I do hypnosis

818
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,520

819
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,520

01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,520
so yeah

822
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,520

823
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:16,520

thank you Real

826
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,520

827
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,520
thank you for a blessed hour and a half of bliss

828
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:28,520
turning work into an exercise in insurance

829
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,520
thank you witness void box

830
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,520
manless disco parties do quite true

831
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,520
and real and ironically

832
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,520
you can influence me any day

833
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:45,520
I so badly wanted to make you do really bad stuff

834
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,520
but I can't do that

835
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,520
so we're going to do it somewhere else instead

836
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,520
but yeah

837
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,520
oh I've still got hypnosis

838
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,520
hold on sorry

839
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,520
no more hypnosis

840
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,520
I'll just do ASMR okay

841
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,520
brain ap

842
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,520
yeah did you like it

843
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,520
does it sound

844
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,520
pardon me

845
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,520
does it sound weird

846
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,520
now that you can't hear the hypnosis humming

847
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,520
yeah

848
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:32,520
that was good well done for me

849
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,520
thank you little real man

850
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,520
oh thank you for all the memberships as well

851
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,520
thank you swirly likes

852
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:43,520
there is a few more memberships

853
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,520
I need to try and fade where the memberships are

854
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,520
so I could do it

855
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,520
I'm gonna read the read me

856
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,520
hold on a minute

857
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,520
I'm trying to fade the freaking memberships

858
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,520
I missed for some reason

859
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,520
stream elements doesn't capture the memberships

860
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:10,520
which is a bit daft if you ask me

861
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,520
but there

862
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,520
I think we did good

863
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,520
I will very quickly type

864
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,520
that the hypnosis part is over

865
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:20,520
oh she's sort of hip

866
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,520
and yep

867
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,520
but then what was it

868
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:31,520
they're below our boogie

869
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:36,520
thank you guys for this simple job

870
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:39,520

871
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,520
and I run for everybody

872
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,520
I've never been in it

873
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,520
since my first experience I was incredible

874
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,520
I'm glad that's what's supposed to happen

875
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,520
so I must be doing something right

876
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,520
thank you guys

877
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,520

01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:03,520
okay if I have latex club song

881
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:05,520
please don't be startled

882
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,520
I'm not doing anything you don't want me to do

883
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,520
I was going to try

884
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,520
oh I really did my same thing

885
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,520
thank you for the memberships

886
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,520
congrats to those who got it with their face

887
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,520
you guys did so well

888
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:26,520
you're not noses

889
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,520
I'm like so freaking out

890
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,520
I've been recovering from over-exercise

891
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,520
I feel quite reliable

892
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,520
thank you again for lovingly saying

893
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,520
for getting those memberships

894
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,520
I can't believe that was an error

895
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,520
that's why I wanted to mention that

896
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,520
I think some people

897
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,520
maybe didn't realise how long I did that for

898
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,520
I think I did alright

899
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,520
that was supposed to happen

900
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,520
well oh I'm so glad

901
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,520
that I could do that for you

902
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,520
now this is the real question I have for you

903
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,520
do you remember this

904
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:25,520
Obey

905
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,520
I was maybe

906
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,520
maybe or maybe not

907
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,520
man thank you for the thank you of the memberships

908
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,520

909
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,520
thank you man 1680

910
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,520
for the thank you of this

911
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:49,520
Obey yeah I may or may not have been

912
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,520
I was kind of like half path love training

913
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,520
and kind of not

914
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:01,520
well look I'm a naughty nally

915
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:03,520
okay I'm naughty

916
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,520
maybe I'm going to be a 180

917
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:08,520
a 180

918
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,520
so yeah

919
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,520
I was probably my fault

920
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,520
I don't even know

921
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,520
I think you're just a memberships t-species

922
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,520
or the left or right journals

923
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,520
or I can tell you

924
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:35,520
this is technically the left ear

925
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,520
and this is technically the right ear

926
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,520
oh wait I said that wrong

927
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,520
this is technically the left ear

928
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,520
this is technically the right ear

929
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,520
but I'm looking at the microphone

930
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,520
as it looks at me

931
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,520
and this is the left ear

932
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,520
and this is the right ear

933
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,520
so good luck I have no idea

934
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:57,520
yeah

935
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,520
something about being real

936
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,520
they're swapped

937
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,520
nah let's get off me

938
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,520
why am I so far over

939
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,520
hold on

940
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:20,520
run

941
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,520
run

942
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,520
I remember seeing you in D4

943
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,520
thanks

944
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:36,520
I stole it from someone in chat

945
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,520
oh my god

946
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,520
sorry Nito

947
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,520
thank you

948
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,520
this is the first time I've enjoyed having no ASMR

949
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,520
thank you for the ASMR

950
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,520
when we have a sign that off

951
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,520
cause you like them

952
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:54,520
thank you

953
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:57,520
I'm gonna see if I can see this missing membership

954
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,520
cause I know for a fact

955
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:00,520
I think two people membered

956
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:01,520
and I couldn't see it

957
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,520
at the particular moment in time

958
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,520
oh it's just added in

959
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,520
oh I'm so sorry I missed it

960
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:19,520
I don't know why stream elements is so broken

961
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,520
I am going too far right now

962
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,520
I don't know why it's so broken

963
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,520
YouTube doesn't have a fan

964
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,520
so it shows me gifted memberships

965
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,520
oh Ivan

966
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,520
Natty

967
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,520
Bologna swamp

968
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,520
I think are the ones I missed

969
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,520
it really doesn't understand my mind

970
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:48,520
they have no stuff usually doesn't do anything for me

971
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,520
but that was amazing

972
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,520
it was amazing

973
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:52,520
oh my

974
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,520
I always get so nervous to do it

975
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:57,520
I'm gonna be honest

976
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,520
I had an anxiety attack when I woke up this morning

977
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,520
what kind of alien are you?

978
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,520
hi I'm Strani

979
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:09,520
I'm a cuttlefish

980
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:11,520
hello

981
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:15,520
cuttlefish are known for their hypnotic patterns

982
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:18,520
and my pupils are also

983
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,520
the pupils of a cuttlefish

984
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:21,520
titty

985
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,520
and now you know

986
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,520
I speak the truth have you slept?

987
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,520
I think I got five hours

988
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:35,520
but okay

989
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,520
let me clean your ears with my latex gloves on

990
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:44,520
okay

991
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:45,520
the mouse clicks

992
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:46,520
oh god are they really loud?

993
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,520
I'm sorry

994
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,520
I don't have any other mouse

995
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,520
okay I clean your ears a little bit

996
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,520
this is just a nice bit of after gear

997
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,520
because it's very important to give after gear

998
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:02,520
after a session

999
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,520
well I think it's really important anyway

1000
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:06,520
but I'm a very

1001
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,520
so I was doing lots of research last night

1002
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:14,520
and I'm what's called a permissive hypnotist

1003
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:18,520
which means I don't necessarily tell you what to do

1004
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,520
I'm just like

1005
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,520
oh well you could imagine

1006
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:24,520
I suggest

1007
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,520
where's like dominant hypnotists

1008
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,520
I'll be like you will go under right now

1009
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,520
but I'm like I can't do that

1010
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,520
I was like wait a minute

1011
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,520
so I'm what's known as a permissive hypnotist

1012
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,520
I'm learning

1013
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:46,520
I feel like this stream has filled my hypnosis

1014
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,520
XP bar

1015
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,520
and I'm really proud of myself

1016
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,520
and I'm so happy you guys liked it

1017
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,520
I'm like smiling really hard right now

1018
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,520
because I'm like half embarrassed, half proud

1019
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,520
and I'm running out of thinking

1020
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,520
go under, under where

1021
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:02,520
wait brutes

1022
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:04,520
but yeah

1023
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,520
it was really the little script you made made off

1024
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:09,520
ah

1025
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:11,520
literally I made just sure the script

1026
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,520
so you guys can see what I worked with

1027
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,520
and then what was improved

1028
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,520
although I have a feeling you can tell

1029
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,520
when I went to improve

1030
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:21,520
because it all fell apart

1031
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,520
it all fell apart

1032
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:30,520
my boss called me before

1033
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,520
before going up started

1034
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,520
I'm still turning the volume please join me up

1035
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:37,520
it is enjoyable, relaxing

1036
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,520
oh

1037
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,520
okay I'm gonna have to fucking do the quickest version of coming up

1038
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:43,520
hold on

1039
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:47,520
because I do not want you under for long periods of time

1040
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,520
that's dangerous

1041
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,520
sorry, thank you

1042
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,520
okay

1043
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,520
for those of you who may feel like

1044
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,520
oh wait, oh wait, hold on, hold on

1045
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,520
fucking send it

1046
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:07,520
for those of you who may feel like you're stuck

1047
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,520
in the water

1048
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:13,520
focus on my hand

1049
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,520
taking yours

1050
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:22,520
as I bring you up to the surface

1051
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,520
we're swimming together

1052
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:33,520
the darkness turns to a light blue hue

1053
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,520
as we continue to go up

1054
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:38,520
up

1055
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,520
up

1056
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,520
and while we do that

1057
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:52,520
we can see the water above

1058
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,520
from the surface tension

1059
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:57,520
up

1060
01:46:57,520 --> 01:46:58,520
up

1061
01:46:58,520 --> 01:46:59,520
up

1062
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:04,520
and as we reach the surface

1063
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:09,520
we both take a big deep breath

1064
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,520
and as you exhale that breath

1065
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,520
you're back to being yourself again

1066
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,520
no longer under

1067
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:36,520
you're up, up, up

1068
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:38,520
don't worry, okay

1069
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,520
you're okay

1070
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,520
I'll put you under later, okay

1071
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,520
yeah, under my butt

1072
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,520
okay, I think the lady takes close-ups

1073
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:51,520
well, if I don't want to go back to being myself again

1074
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:55,520
am I supposed to corrupt you if you're not awake?

1075
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,520
mom, hello

1076
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,520
thank you for this super chat

1077
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:03,520
fell asleep four times and woke up every time we're extreme

1078
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:05,520
and did not even sleep in bed

1079
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,520
make me fall asleep peacefully

1080
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,520
you caught my ass, thank you, because I've been you asleep, bye

1081
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:17,520
okay, let's do a few more bubbles

1082
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,520
I like the bubbles, they're my favorite right now

1083
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,520
I think you made the ear licking at your own

1084
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,520
oh, no, this can't be

1085
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:37,520
I'll be aching patiently for you to take more of what's already here

1086
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,520
oh, stop, you're gonna get me, right?

1087
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,520
write another script

1088
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,520
sorry, thank you for the temperature

1089
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,520
thank you, I'm up and so excited

1090
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:51,520
I'm everything you're typical

1091
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,520
nothing

1092
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,520
first I've catching you live

1093
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:56,520
a friend introduced me to your channel a few weeks

1094
01:48:56,520 --> 01:48:58,520
and it was super relaxing

1095
01:48:58,520 --> 01:48:59,520
oh, thank you

1096
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,520
I'm normally wildly inappropriate as well

1097
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,520
so, just worrying in you

1098
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:05,520
have a fall asleep, please help

1099
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,520
I do have a video on my channel called

1100
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,520
Thy Crushing You

1101
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,520
because the sound of holding the hypnosis off

1102
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:13,520
crap, sorry

1103
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,520
thank you for calling

1104
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,520
okay, okay, hi, sorry

1105
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,520
no, no one hypnosis, okay

1106
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:19,520
no hypnosis

1107
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:23,520
it's house

1108
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,520
oh no, no, write in another script

1109
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:28,520
that's definitely not what we want

1110
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,520
hi, hi, okay, no hypnosis

1111
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:33,520
sorry, I keep being silly, Billy

1112
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:38,520
yeah, I really enjoyed it

1113
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,520
sorry, I was only drilling a bit

1114
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,520
from where were you drilling?

1115
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,520
please tell me the technical

1116
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,520
I didn't even do anything, no

1117
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:55,520
I should have done something while I had you under

1118
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,520
me, but I was too worried

1119
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,520
so I didn't do it

1120
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,520
I have drool over my shirt, but worth it

1121
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,520
oh, real

1122
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,520
my nose, oh yeah

1123
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,520
I do, I actually do genuinely

1124
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:14,520
like, the thought of like

1125
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:18,520
you at your desk, sitting in your chair

1126
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:21,520
and you just have a blank look at the screen

1127
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,520
I cannot tell you, that'll make you possible

1128
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,520
thank you internet, passofea

1129
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:32,520
for the super chat

1130
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,520
the more officialization was very funny

1131
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:36,520
and character, eventually I couldn't tell

1132
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,520
where my images ended and years began

1133
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,520
you create events, smart out

1134
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,520
you're bright and enjoyed it just as much

1135
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,520
ah, thank you so much for the compliment

1136
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,520
I put all my stats into luck, though

1137
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:50,520
no intelligence

1138
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,520
ah, ah, ah

1139
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,520
wow

1140
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:00,520
I can open my eyes, mommy was so

1141
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,520
enchanted by your voice

1142
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:04,520
I did ask for you guys

1143
01:51:04,520 --> 01:51:06,520
I said twice, if you don't remember

1144
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,520
don't worry, but I did say twice

1145
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,520
if your eyes were heavy

1146
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,520
close them, but you can keep

1147
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:14,520
listening to my voice

1148
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,520
we did have a visualization

1149
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,520
for those who can imagine

1150
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,520
and it was that we swam down together

1151
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,520
but it got really dark

1152
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,520
but that was your eyes closing

1153
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,520
technically and you being at the

1154
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,520
deepest level of hypnosis that I could

1155
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,520
get you into

1156
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,520
sorry, I'm really passionate about this

1157
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,520
I'm literally running out of breath

1158
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,520
seeing my sentences

1159
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,520
all points on luck and magic

1160
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,520
hypnosis is magic

1161
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:44,520
ah, I'm glad you liked it

1162
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,520
look maxing for the wench

1163
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,520
your hair

1164
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,520
it's fine, thank you for the super chat

1165
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,520
that really was how it was

1166
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:54,520
I was blue, likely relaxing

1167
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,520
in my chair, even as you

1168
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,520
learned me to sleep, I heard your voice

1169
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,520
in what you were saying

1170
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,520
so when you had us wake up, I really did

1171
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:04,520
aw, glad

1172
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,520
I really need to watch the VOD after stream

1173
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,520
yes, I will timestamp this VOD

1174
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:10,520
to highlight

1175
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,520
that the hypnosis

1176
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,520
stops when I were 30

1177
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:16,520
and then I bring you back

1178
01:52:16,520 --> 01:52:18,520
for a second time

1179
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,520
for those who were unable to listen

1180
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,520
and now I'm doing

1181
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:24,520
after care, giving you all the kisses

1182
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:26,520
um

1183
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,520
I'm so proud and happy

1184
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,520
of you and thank you for letting me

1185
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,520
explore my interest

1186
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,520
I had a really good day

1187
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:36,520
unfortunately, I think my voice is dying

1188
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,520
slowly but I had a really good time

1189
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,520
I thoroughly enjoyed that

1190
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,520
I'm so freaking happy

1191
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:44,520
I've always enjoyed hypnosis

1192
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,520
but I've never had the fucking pulse

1193
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,520
to produce it myself, okay?

1194
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:50,520
I'm just, I'm worried

1195
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:52,520
I'm worried that people are going to be

1196
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,520
like, all the couple fish

1197
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:56,520
hypnosis thing is just the gimmick

1198
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,520
and it's like, no, I'm actually really passionate

1199
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:00,520
about it

1200
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:02,520
Jackson Shaw

1201
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,520
thank you for the super chat

1202
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,520
I watched it at work and it was worth it

1203
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,520
I feel so relaxed, great work, sadly my tent

1204
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,520
goes up in these things

1205
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,520
I didn't put any, I didn't

1206
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:14,520
put any tentacle markers and no

1207
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:16,520
I didn't put any tentacle markers

1208
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,520
and

1209
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:20,520
I'm gonna have to listen to the bone

1210
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,520
most of the stream

1211
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,520
the float, yeah, I think you may have to

1212
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:26,520
go back to the store if you wanted to go under

1213
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:28,520
because I didn't

1214
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:30,520
go back and like try and

1215
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,520
catch a few stray

1216
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,520
stray reeflings that were trying to swim away

1217
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,520
sorry, my voice is going

1218
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,520
hold on, I will drink a water

1219
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,520
so

1220
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:04,520
your voice already gets me going

1221
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:06,520
so I did not stop

1222
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:08,520
oh

1223
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,520
um

1224
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:12,520
Ruto Kawakami

1225
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,520
thank you for the super chat

1226
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,520
you did a really wonderful moment, keep up the

1227
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,520
me some work, thank you so much

1228
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,520
I'm sorry I can't interview

1229
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,520
the water, I need it

1230
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:24,520
suavemente

1231
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,520
because

1232
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,520
I just want to make sure you're okay

1233
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,520
and everyone's feeling okay

1234
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:32,520
yeah

1235
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,520
I need to make sure I look after you

1236
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:36,520
and something like that, it's very important

1237
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,520
if you need to hydrate

1238
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:40,520
as well

1239
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,520
little reefling, please do

1240
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,520
I seriously, I had you for

1241
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,520
an over-theory under

1242
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:48,520
so if you were under, please hydrate

1243
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,520
please toilet, please snack

1244
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:52,520
okay

1245
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,520
I've got a feeling back in my mind

1246
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:56,520
some likes, this is awesome

1247
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,520
really enjoyable, I'm glad you enjoyed that

1248
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,520
worried you literally bit a finger in my

1249
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,520
eye to get tickly

1250
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,520
yeah

1251
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:08,520
that's how I've made

1252
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:10,520
my spine think

1253
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,520
the coping

1254
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,520
chocolate, a bad blast

1255
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,520
is that that

1256
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,520
sugary drink, be honest

1257
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,520
wow

1258
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,520
I just finished

1259
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:24,520
I just went down and finished my Gundam model

1260
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:26,520
fingers on your Gundam model

1261
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:28,520
is it blue, be honest

1262
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,520
every day I see

1263
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,520
someone build a Gundam model

1264
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,520
it's always blue

1265
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:36,520
no, my headphones right here just broke

1266
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:40,520
the world said no

1267
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,520
I'm really happy you enjoyed it

1268
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,520
that's what I'm happiest about

1269
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,520
literally, I've always had a secret obsession

1270
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:48,520
but okay, I said, I said I have a secret obsession

1271
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,520
but this stream

1272
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,520
has given me the confidence to make

1273
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:54,520
the

1274
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,520
forget your name and become a reefling

1275
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,520
for two hours one

1276
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,520
I really want to challenge myself to make it

1277
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,520
good

1278
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,520
you know

1279
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,520
if someone saw me, they would think

1280
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:08,520
I'm having a stroke, I'm adjusting

1281
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,520
and ironically

1282
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,520
I feel way better than okay

1283
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:14,520
it was a long week and I feel like I got second

1284
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,520
when oh, I'm so glad

1285
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,520
as long as everyone feels good

1286
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,520
I really don't want anyone walking away

1287
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:24,520
with a negative experience

1288
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,520
okay, I need to bring myself up

1289
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,520
a little bit

1290
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:30,520
I don't want anyone

1291
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,520
to have a negative experience with me, okay

1292
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,520
that's how I got that

1293
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:36,520
and name your ears

1294
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:38,520
and

1295
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,520
I do the bubbles, I love the bubbles

1296
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,520
I'm literally a child

1297
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:44,520
I'm like, fuck you, I love the bubbles

1298
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:48,520
yeah, my brain's gonna straight up melt

1299
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,520
the better you get at this, I mean

1300
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:52,520
that's kind of the plan

1301
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:56,520
I love that

1302
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,520
yeah, it's gonna be

1303
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:00,520
a video

1304
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:02,520
I had noticed this video

1305
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:04,520
I think

1306
01:57:04,520 --> 01:57:06,520
I just

1307
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:08,520
maybe record my model

1308
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,520
and put the goggles on

1309
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,520
and then that would be the video

1310
01:57:12,520 --> 01:57:14,520
because I think that would be cool

1311
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,520
seeing you sign up

1312
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,520
because I had to vent this stuff

1313
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:20,520
makes me even

1314
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:22,520
for you to take us through the future

1315
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:24,520
makes me even more excited for the day

1316
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,520
because I will come in the future

1317
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,520
I have great memories

1318
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:30,520
so hypnotizing isn't an easy feat

1319
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:32,520
um

1320
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:34,520
yeah, I know some people

1321
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:36,520
are like naturally

1322
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:38,520
resistant and some people just straight up

1323
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:40,520
doesn't work on, which is perfectly fair

1324
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:42,520
and understandable, don't worry

1325
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:44,520
I'm not gonna do a massive content shift

1326
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:46,520
towards all hypnosis when I want

1327
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,520
no, I'm still gonna be memeing on my video games

1328
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:50,520
um

1329
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:52,520
um

1330
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:54,520
I legit just look forward to your streams

1331
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,520
joining me, I'm happy

1332
01:57:56,520 --> 01:57:58,520
um, thank you, mommy ASMR

1333
01:57:58,520 --> 01:58:00,520
gonna be bad, thank you

1334
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:02,520
um

1335
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,520
um

1336
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:06,520
actually

1337
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:08,520
my little reeflings

1338
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,520
I have a bit of

1339
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:12,520
what, stop being small

1340
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:14,520
please stop being small for one second

1341
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,520
no, that doesn't make it hard

1342
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:18,520
it is not

1343
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,520
oh

1344
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,520
thank you for the super chat

1345
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,520
darling galadia

1346
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:26,520
thank you for this, I'm only reefling myself

1347
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,520
because I've been watching all over your lab

1348
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:30,520
today, I know that I must have

1349
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,520
you all in my life, mommy

1350
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,520
yes, please, with my daughters

1351
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,520
share my daughters

1352
01:58:36,520 --> 01:58:38,520
I'll sit in the hotel chair, okay

1353
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
I don't mind

1354
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:42,520
I honestly don't

1355
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,520
my little reeflings

1356
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,520
go small

1357
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,520
actually if I had

1358
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,520
um

1359
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:52,520
yeah

1360
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,520
okay

1361
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,520
now

1362
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:58,520
I must say something

1363
01:58:58,520 --> 01:59:00,520
for those of you who are a membership

1364
01:59:00,520 --> 01:59:02,520
I'm going to end stream and set up life of Brian

1365
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,520
because we're gonna do a watch vlog

1366
01:59:04,520 --> 01:59:06,520
but thank you everyone who joined me today

1367
01:59:06,520 --> 01:59:08,520
I am so appreciative

1368
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,520
and I'm really glad that you enjoyed it

1369
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:12,520
and I'm so glad that everyone feels good

1370
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,520
because I was really worried about the after care

1371
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:16,520
to make sure you're okay and you're back with me

1372
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,520
but I think we're good

1373
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,520
okay

1374
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,520
so it's not all over

1375
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:24,520
yet though

1376
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,520
because

1377
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:28,520
I'm going to send you on to a

1378
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:30,520
very important person

1379
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,520
okay

1380
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:34,520
and I want you to keep

1381
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,520
an open mind for her

1382
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:38,520
just as you keep

1383
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:40,520
an open mind for me

1384
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:42,520
she is my

1385
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,520
great friend Shipee

1386
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,520
and she's very good at taking care of others

1387
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,520
okay

1388
01:59:48,520 --> 01:59:50,520
now I think

1389
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,520
I'm like 99% sure

1390
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:54,520
she is doing ear cleaning

1391
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,520
ASMR

1392
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:58,520
okay so

1393
01:59:58,520 --> 02:00:00,520
you know how to behave

1394
02:00:00,520 --> 02:00:02,520
I know

1395
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:04,520
that you'll behave

1396
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,520
because you are good at knowing to behave in other streams

1397
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:08,520
there is again

1398
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:10,520
no lasting effects

1399
02:00:10,520 --> 02:00:12,520
off this screen just to reassure you

1400
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,520
I left in a slight

1401
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,520
influence but it is

1402
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,520
nothing that will affect you in any way

1403
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,520
shape or form

1404
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,520
like seriously obviously the tiniest influence

1405
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,520
and it wasn't an effect

1406
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,520
an effect is different influence is just a tiny

1407
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:28,520
little thing where I may randomly

1408
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,520
pop into your head that's all

1409
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,520
okay that's it nothing else

1410
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:34,520
okay

1411
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,520
but then again that doesn't mean

1412
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,520
I can't influence you to be my good boy

1413
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:40,520
hey y'all

1414
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,520
