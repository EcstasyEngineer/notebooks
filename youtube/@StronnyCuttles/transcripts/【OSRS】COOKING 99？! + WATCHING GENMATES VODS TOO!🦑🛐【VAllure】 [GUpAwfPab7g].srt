1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Don't throw up on themselves, no don't throw up, don't throw up, I'm here, oh baby, oh my sweet baby, don't throw up, don't throw up my baby, sweetie, are you there, are you there darling, I think so, oh no, okay

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh really, oh, I swear this game has it's way, but not in a zoo, do we?

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Um, sorry, that is so cheesy and I love it, I love that too, hello reflins you're not throwing up on yourself, you don't, let me wipe the sick off of you, no I have ultra low latency and it just so long to get up, I don't know why

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh reflins, let me wipe the sick off you, you didn't need to throw up okay darling, oh dear, oh dear you got yourself in a right to his didn't you

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh good morning, good evening good afternoon, now I do have the background audio playing a little bit if it's not too distracting

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mummy's sent voting to herself, no, what, I would never do something, oh that's so embarrassing, no

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Your senses are gonna, good morning, are we ready for first test endurance stream? I'm a little bit nervous, I had a few heart flutters this morning when I woke up and I wanna say that when I woke up I mean literally 15 minutes ago

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hi mummy, hello reflins, I'm game and out of game, good morning, am I ready? Right, I'm just gonna say I had some heart flutters which were, I had to sit down, a few blood pressure issues but I think I'll be okay

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll tell you if I don't feel well, but got my tea, got my beef, you know how yesterday when we played and who wants to be a millionaire, oh god it's been like so long since I played Runescape, I'm like ooh I'm about to be in like a complete baby on the game again

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right we'll ramble for a little bit and I'll get used to pulling out wings again, oh my god, okay, okay there we go, let's go

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Right, for updates, I don't know, line up little reflins, for those of you who are on Patreon you have early access to an absolutely cursed audio called pregnant with you ASMR

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Those of you who have listened, do I need to edit the stomach sounds quieter cause my stomach was popping off, it was like tchoo tchoo tchoo, it literally sounded like rrrrrrrrrr every time I was recording a freaking thing

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It was 10 out of 10, it doesn't need any editing, that baby me, the father of me, stomach sounds will be the best part

14
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay listen to it and it's perfect, okay it doesn't require any editing, I made that in like a tired haze, I was like oh yes I will make the oh

15
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going, okay if it's good then for those of you who are not on Patreon please don't worry that video is gonna be coming out in 20 hours

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So at midnight in Australia, but only my part of Australia, but you have to guess which part of Australia, ooh I could be talking about Tasmania, ooh New South Wales, ooh Northern Territory, ooh no

17
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
At midnight is when I will release it, I'm gonna do it 2 hours before AC's usual uptime because I try and not do that

18
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Mercy's yandere roleplay on YouTube is back up, she did want it taken down cause she wasn't happy with the subtitles and there was a font issue

19
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then it looked like for some reason the apostrophe came out like an eye, so whenever there was an apostrophe it looked bizarre, it looked like we were trying to form a new sentence and I'm like oh that never happens to me but

20
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thanks for the war, I didn't listen to it yet so I'll trust all the reasons, honestly got a tear down my face, it's very good

21
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh wait was it like, is the word cathartic, oh I don't know what the word is, was it like really like oh mummies in Tasmania, could you imagine if I was Tasmanian bro

22
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Call me the devil cause I'm Tasmania

23
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It would be 12 hours of me trying to come up with a conversation to get these wines done

24
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Now I don't know if there's a runescaper, a rune reefling if you will, a rune reefling for runescapers

25
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No a rune reefling, yeah a rune reefling, okay

26
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That can do the napkin math of 29,000 wines, not sure how long that's gonna take

27
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But we can get it down real close to 99, whether or not we'll manage, fuck me yourself George if you want

28
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I hypnotic Tasmanian cutfish, she said, same weight as an Alaskan billworm

29
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What even is that, I'm sorry I actually don't know what that is, is that a type of worm in the ground, like it's literal

30
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And they just call it a billworm cause it's a bit bigger than the average worm

31
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
A reef scape, aww that's cute, I like that name

32
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
2.4k wines an hour, right, shit

33
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What does that mean, what is 2 times 12

34
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There's gonna be a sixth stream for this cause I pissed about in the first and second ones so much, whoopsies

35
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay this might not be the last one, but the next stringer and stream will be the last one, okay, real

36
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You've got to lock in though, the chances of me locking in are rather low, I have to be honest, I won't be

37
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I like taking it easy, it's about the journey and the yapping I got to do along the way, okay

38
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a myth worm that's usually the same as almost as big as Australian fooders, okay

39
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mummy's gonna wine and dine, are you joking, I have like wine for literally the whole planet right now

40
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Like actually I say I have wine for the whole planet, I also only have enough wine to satisfy Ireland for a day, so

41
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah when some you lose some, yeah when some you lose some, yeah this is nice

42
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So is this the RuneScape gameplay, here's so much about it, I am so sorry if this is your first experience with RuneScape

43
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is a terrible entry to what RuneScape is, just consider this asatsu, how about that, just consider it asatsu

44
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is it, this is the gameplay, I am currently in a location called Edgeville Bank, okay

45
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I am doing what's called winemaking and you have limited inventory slots

46
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And this is it, there's more stuff to do we swear, like so there is more to do but we're alcohol maxing

47
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I would estimate a Europace like 15k by the 12 hour mark

48
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah if this is your first thing, RuneScape is a numbers up kind of game via different methods

49
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And there's like player versus player if you're like interested in being like I'm the best and there's like combat and stuff if you like that

50
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But me, so I'll show you this, these are like the skills that you can get as you can see my membership ran out

51
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Cause I didn't realise you didn't need membership to do winem

52
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can level up your skills to 99 and I have picked cooking because I'm a wham and I didn't want to pick anything else

53
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But if I picked the Fletch in, I could have done it like in record time

54
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Cause the reflins literally I'm so rich in game cause the reflins kept coming up to me and giving me all their money and I'm like

55
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't know how to say thank you for this but now I'm rich in game

56
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I mean 15, I don't know why I type 1500 hours, you're just feeling quirky like that

57
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I didn't even question it, I just accepted it, I'm like yeah no I'm here for a good time like I'm ready to strap in

58
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I just didn't question it

59
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She is roleplaying her lore in RuneScape so she hypnotised people to help conquer the world

60
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sorry I have a really bad heart palpitation this morning, I don't know what's going on with me

61
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Now once I reach 99, we might come back at a later date and do questing

62
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Cause we were mucking about doing questing

63
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Finn Dom and RuneScape, no then I start paying RuneS or whatever

64
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Insert terminology would be paying RuneS

65
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh it sounds like eww

66
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But it's kinda like one of those games where just if you ever want something casual where you're not like

67
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well if you don't take it casually

68
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Finn coming through

69
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, absolutely not

70
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
When it's like

71
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Literally like

72
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're appealing to pay piggy

73
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Shut the fuck up, I literally made pregnant with you ASMR

74
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Go and actually get a fucking life, go and actually get a clue

75
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You have absolutely no concept of what fun community you could possibly have

76
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Because you're such a nasty little ratbag

77
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Anyway, that's just my two cents

78
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Good morning

79
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like literally you have no concept of how much love and cherishment that you can show towards both parties

80
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
For both streamers, from strongy to reefling and reefling to strongy, you know what I mean

81
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you will never have that experience

82
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And not only do I gloat and you never having that experience

83
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I equally feel sad that you will never have that experience of that unconditional love that is offered to you

84
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because the only way you can imagine it is an exchange of goods

85
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And we're, it's not

86
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We don't even have to

87
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Good morning

88
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Shadow Boxing

89
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Level 99 Shadow Boxing

90
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I fucking love being so good at Shadow Boxing

91
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Take this

92
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You know?

93
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So I was punching my little hands

94
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But yes, we are your friends

95
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You

96
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Who angered me?

97
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ah, it's just myself

98
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm really good at doing it

99
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't you worry

100
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Fight the demons money

101
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Fight the demons

102
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But watch yourself

103
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Fight the demons

104
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But show them who they're working with

105
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Fight the demons

106
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Watch yourself

107
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Wow

108
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't even know who that is

109
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Is it someone controversial?

110
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Please, I'm scared

111
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Who's got balloons?

112
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You have to poke someone's eye out with them balloons

113
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank you the Tonysu

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
To the Super Chat

115
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm so sorry, I don't know who

116
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't know what it means

117
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But I'm so, I'm so glad you guys like the pregnancy

118
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I can't wait to see all the comments being like

119
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What?

120
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And then, because everyone will click on it and be like

121
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What?

122
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And then it's literally just me going

123
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Fredy Zaka

124
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Fredy Zaka

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't leave me

126
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't leave me

127
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The thing is like

129
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh my god

130
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh my god, she's such a cash grab

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm a puppet

132
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm a sheep

133
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm a cash cow

134
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You bitches

135
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Mesh

136
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Based on henji

137
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh no

138
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Can I get a rundown?

139
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Can I get a lore?

140
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Can I get a Wikipedia article?

141
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What's the deal?

142
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What am I missing?

143
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What is the context of this name?

144
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And then

145
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh wait, is it a

146
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
D's nuts in your mouth

147
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But because of my accent that doesn't work

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Joe, henji of Mars or something

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you squidding me right now?

150
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Eh

151
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No!

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh god

153
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Thank you Vulcan Dynasty

154
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's actually hilarious

155
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I am so sorry

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I did not expect that

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you for the super chat

For your super chat

161
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That is hilarious

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What, you need a little twang into the

163
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Into the voice?

164
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Eh, who's that going?

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Eh, actually get to that spicy sausage

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Did you guys like my

167
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That was so funny

168
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because he went deaf?

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
How dare you?

170
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do you mean when I say

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
DADDY?

172
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It doesn't make you

173
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Your pintice shrivel

174
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh no, you mean

175
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Boss shrivel

176
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I did a

177
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I got a new short today

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I actually did really well

179
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hold on

180
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Wait, hold on

181
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm linking the short

182
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, it literally did 2 out of 10

183
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
For my most recent uploaded content

184
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I literally did so well

185
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Sorry, I'm making you all watch it

186
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't care

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll say what was it

188
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You get right

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Are you squidding me?

190
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Say his name and he appears

191
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I believe in Joe Hendry

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
HotClap

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I believe in Joe Hendry

194
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is he a good boy?

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Are you guys trolling me?

196
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Right, fine

197
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm looking it up

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I swear to god

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If it's a fucking

200
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like that fucking baby

201
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Fucking pacifier

202
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Beach over

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Fucking mean that you guys

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Always get me with

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is that when she imports us

206
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Onto the farm

207
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We have to pass a

208
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Scott dialect test

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
To become citizens

210
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Look it up

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Actually part of the citizenship process

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Aw

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Real answer

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Alright, I've looked up Joe Hendry

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He's a wrestler

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He wears blue shorts

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Wait, what about him though?

218
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why?

219
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Joseph Samuel Hendry

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Is a Scottish professional wrestler

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There is

222
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay, he's Scottish

223
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Go Scotland

224
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Juicen

225
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Was it

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Edward's army

227
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Running over the hills again

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Got him really bad at one national anthem

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And yeah, when it comes to zoos

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm all over it like a rash

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Short behaviour

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Thank you zoos, good boy

233
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And thank you Tainy Spainy

234
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay, right

235
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The tour meme

236
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Bruh, I used to get caught

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
With the tour meme

238
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
All the fucking tape

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry

240
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh my god

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I didn't understand it

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was like, what's going on?

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
They'd be like

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh my god

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh my god

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Someone's just done this

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Absolutely catastrophic thing

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And I'd be like

249
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh my god, what is that?

250
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And then click on Twitter

251
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And it was like

252
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh

253
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Come on bruh

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Don't fucking tour baby me

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But she's adorable

256
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But da da baby

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But da baby

258
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I can't believe

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Actually

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You know what

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I should talk about VTuber fucking lore

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's the Rick Astley of VTuber lore

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You know

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I didn't know the Scotland national anthem either

267
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No, no you do

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You do

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's like

270
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Fucking

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Old Flare of Scotland

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
When will we see

273
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I can't sing

274
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're like

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It goes up even higher

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't know why it's so high

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But

278
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And then

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And then

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
King Edward's army

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
To think again

282
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's literally straight up against England

283
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
We're like

284
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
England

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You have tried to eradicate the Scots

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
For many a year

289
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
We've had enough

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Let us have this national anthem

291
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Okay

292
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Never gonna give you up mummy

293
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Never gonna

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Did you see what Emmie did on Twitter?

295
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She's putting her oiled up feetsies

296
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
For 20K

297
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Wait

298
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Hold on

299
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What do you mean?

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What did my little sister do?

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What did my little sister do?

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Is it on her main or is it on her own?

303
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
She put it on the right like

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Mercy keeps accidentally putting stuff on the wrong thing

305
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Is it on her own?

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Is it on her own?

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh hi

308
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Emmie

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Actually I just ordered Emmie's artwork

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Because she's getting

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
She's getting two song covers

312
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And then they're getting anime

313
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And she drew one

314
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What the fuck

315
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is my little

316
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
30 minutes ago

317
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Wait, scabity

318
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh no someone clicked Emmie

319
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Sorry, the Emmie didn't say scabity

320
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There's some cut there

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Going to buy alcohol

322
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Someone bought me

323
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Em covers

324
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Of a certain variety

325
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hold on let me do this one handed

326
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm holding my cup of tea before it gets cold

327
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Do you think you sly?

328
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I know what you're doing

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Wait it must be on her main then

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What did she do?

331
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
She did a pop up stream

332
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And she's doing more hand cam streams

333
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Never, she would say she would be the author

334
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
On her own a couple of days ago

335
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The drawing?

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The drawing

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
She forgot her pentagram

338
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No

339
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know how to say how she got

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Her tattoo slash marking

341
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But it was at your death

342
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's how she obtained

343
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh my god

344
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Someone drew the reeflings

345
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's the fucking

346
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The fucking thing

347
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh my god hold on

348
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hold on

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hold on

350
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Hold on where is it

351
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Show yourself

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh my god

353
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Hold on

354
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I literally just saw this

355
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Wait hold on fuck

356
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I need the pointer thing

357
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh my god

358
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've already forgotten

359
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The wee

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Raccoon's name

361
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Wait why have I forgotten his wee name

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I've already forgot

363
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh look at you wee darling

364
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you the cutest

365
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh no

366
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Got to gee your bath again

367
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Sai because you're all dirty

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Oh my god it's so cute

369
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I can't handle it

370
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I love it

371
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is like undeniably

372
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If you're a pinata

373
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Don't crack

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't crack his open

375
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
We have ink not candy inside

376
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We've a pinata

377
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Right I'm going to drink my tea

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Before it gets unbelievably cold

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Well it's already room temperature

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I tried my best

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm so bad at doing that in time

382
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Right and we will get ready to watch

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The VODs okay

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Just let me rant a little bit

385
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let me ramble a little bit

386
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
First we have no management

387
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
To send me my

388
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
See I get abused

389
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I get abused

390
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't

391
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I get everything last

392
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Unlike the

393
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
All the girls

394
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Get all their stuff done first

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So I get mine done last

396
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm getting it

397
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Right are you ready

398
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
For what next week's schedule is

399
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you ready

400
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Are you ready

401
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Steady boom

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay

403
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Aha there you go

404
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I

405
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm going to play a childhood game

406
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Called Blinks now I got stuck on level 2

407
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
In Blinks as a child

408
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Because I was such a child

409
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do

410
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So I'll be a curious one

411
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We are going to then do the classic

412
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Ace Mar Stream and then I'm forcing you

413
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
To watch Beauty and the Beast with me Disney style

414
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Who goes out

415
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And then we are doing back to back

416
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Lego Lord of the Rings

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
We're going to 100% it

418
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I mean I'm such MLG pro that I know

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
How to 100% the game

420
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And then we're going to play Pagel

421
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I remember playing

422
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The Trial of Pagel

423
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
On Xbox 360

424
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And

425
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I remember making a particular

426
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Noise that was like boom boom boom boom

427
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Like that and then like the more you got

428
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The higher the pitch went

429
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I was like you know what actually

430
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's get a shot like let's actually give Pagel

431
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Pagel a shot right

432
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And then I have a member's

433
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Handcam Ace Mar Stream

434
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's a test

435
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I know that sounds bizarre

436
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Why would you need to test Ace Mar

437
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I bought

438
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
A mannequin prop

439
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That I might either make a video

440
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Or a stream about but I wanted to test

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That you guys first like I feel comfortable

442
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Testing it as a like thingy

443
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That is such I remember

444
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That so much like oh you'll get like

445
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So much you'll get gamer score

446
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
If you like do this or look up my youtube channel

447
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's such a good mod

448
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That person is saying an Xbox

449
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Reference before you think they're being weird

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That is an Xbox

451
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Reference

452
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We are then doing a mysterious

453
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Dead by Daylight collab

454
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Outside Vialeur

455
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Those outside Vialeur

456
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Now please do check

457
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The time on Saturday

458
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It is not my usual

459
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Start time

460
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The Dead by Daylight collab

461
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Sets me one hour

462
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Later

463
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Than I usually start

464
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And I believe that will be

465
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Finished and wrapped up in two hours

466
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay two hours

467
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And then

468
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We'll play Fortnite

469
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I think Fortnite

470
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Unless you guys want to play a different

471
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And then

472
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We're gonna test

473
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
1v1 chest in a member stream

474
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And if that's successful

475
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Then the following week

476
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'll do

477
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
1v1 chest in general

478
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
If it's just a nightmare

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't know if it should be one of those things

480
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Where like I'm not allowed to go offline until I win

481
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Because yeah

482
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Is LEGO 31st

483
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Starting late for any reason

484
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes

485
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh that's thank you

486
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
LEGO Lord of the Rings is starting

487
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Two hours later because

488
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
That's when the group meeting for Vialeur

489
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's the best time slot for everyone to meet up

490
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Hold on

491
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Let me sip my tea

492
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm gonna finish my tea, give me one second

493
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes the best time

494
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
For everyone to meet up for the

495
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Meeting

496
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Vialeur meeting is actually right when I stream

497
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Because it's not too late for AC

498
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
But because everyone is American

499
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And Canadian outside of that

500
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It means the best time

501
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Is right on my time slot

502
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
But we are playing LEGO Lord of the Rings

503
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So hopefully it's worth the wait

504
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It's a fantastic game

505
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Absolutely fantastic game

506
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I watched the VOD for that stream

507
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Oh do apologize unfortunately

508
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But

509
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah so

510
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Two streams are not at the regular

511
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Time

512
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Wed and stay

513
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Two hours later

514
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And then Mysterious Dead by Daylight

515
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I was originally gonna come on for an hour

516
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But I was like oh that does

517
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
They make any sense like it just does

518
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
But

519
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I hope you enjoy the people

520
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm playing that Mysterious collab with

521
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I have to fucking play Dead by Daylight

522
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Again

523
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Because I've not played it

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Apparently there's like a billion new killers

525
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
A billion new

526
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
IP things that they've bought

527
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The rights to use

528
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Apparently there's a billion new perks

529
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
There's new systems in place

530
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And I'm like

531
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Like I have to play a tutorial

532
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Because they've changed everything in Dead by Daylight

533
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They did like an overhaul from the old game

534
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And I'm like shit I'm old game

535
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Dead by Daylight I'm not new game

536
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Dead by Daylight

537
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Check me

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
More like strong again

539
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Check me pressed

540
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh you don't wanna

541
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You don't wanna

542
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Well I thought we could

543
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Maybe you know

544
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
But I guess not

545
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Jeez

546
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Dead by Daylight learning stream win

547
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Well I'm actually gonna play it

548
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Offline

549
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Just

550
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
To try I mean

551
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
And impromptu

552
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Dead by Daylight stream

553
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Although I'm trying to get all my ASMR

554
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Collabs out the way

555
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So I've kinda discovered that after stream

556
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I have like enough energy to do one thing

557
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So offline win

558
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
He tried nice one

559
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's like going back home to a small town

560
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And now it's just a grand central station

561
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Literally I'm like I can't believe I have to say

562
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm like old school Dead by Daylight

563
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Like I don't recognise any of the systems

564
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That are in place I'm like fuck

565
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I have to brush up on my gameplay

566
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Can they be embarrassing via Lora

567
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I need to prove that I'm a gamer oh lord

568
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Give me decisive strike I don't have the perk unlocked

569
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Please I need self heal and Claudette please

570
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
That's what the meta used to be

571
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You know

572
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Maybe we could do an impromptu

573
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Dead by Daylight

574
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Is there a way for me to get

575
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You guys in my lobby in Dead by Daylight

576
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Without having to add you on stream

577
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Surely Dead by Daylight understands

578
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
That it's a well streamed game

579
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Surely

580
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Surely

581
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Okay I've almost finished my cold cleaner

582
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Playing old mate on new mail

583
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
There's a code system

584
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That we can do custom lobbies

585
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh maybe

586
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Okay okay

587
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Maybe we make fortnite

588
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Dead by Daylight

589
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Snipes

590
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Don't ever use self-care

591
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's like really whack now

592
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I remember it used to be like

593
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
When it was tier 3

594
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It was like 40 seconds to heal yourself

595
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And you didn't have to rely on teammates

596
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And that was like

597
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't even know how the ranking system looks

598
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
When back in my day

599
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It used to be like

600
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
20 to 1

601
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And if you were rank 1

602
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It was like ooh really good

603
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The lore you were

604
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Ooh not as good

605
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I suppose one solution is to add reeflings to our friends

606
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And then remove them all at the same time

607
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Even though

608
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The account is fully private

609
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'd really worry

610
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
About brain worms being like

611
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh mummy added that reefling

612
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But didn't add me as a reefling

613
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
She hates me

614
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And again

615
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I do want to be like

616
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Would you rather a streamer

617
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Add anything like that at all

618
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But I do want to be considerate

619
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I don't just want to drop

620
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They're like

621
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
You know

622
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
They're brain worms

623
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes I'm aware of your brain worms

624
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You guys are in trouble honestly

625
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But yeah

626
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It's about time

627
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's about power

628
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Those reeflings don't speak for us

629
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I just don't want to hurt anyone

630
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I feel like if you're hanging out with me

631
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We'll just be chilling

632
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You know

633
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just want it to be good

634
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't want anyone being like

635
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
She hates me specific

636
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No this is exactly what I'm talking about

637
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And after that

638
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
On Sunday Halo Combat Evolved

639
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I will

640
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I will

641
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Tell you my dad's letter

642
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Now remember my dad's a guy

643
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So it's not exactly

644
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
A sauna or something

645
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'll bring a tear to your eye

646
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But that's because I'm a wuss

647
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But I'll tell my dad's little letter to you

648
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But if you want the TLDR

649
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's basically thank you for looking after my daughter

650
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
When I couldn't

651
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Because you know distance and stuff

652
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
When I was going through really bad stuff last year

653
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Because obviously

654
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I explained to my dad the situation

655
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And all of that and he was like

656
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You just

657
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I kid you not he said the sentence

658
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You just stick to your own

659
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And it was like

660
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
My own is like my refunds

661
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And it was really nice

662
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
He was like you just stick to your own

663
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I was like fuck yeah stick to my own

664
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
We got his approval we're in

665
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Basically

666
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Basically

667
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
He's happy

668
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Very happy

669
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Because my dad's internet

670
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So heavy and all of that

671
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh my god sorry

672
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
My dad is a wee gossip by the way

673
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He

674
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
My dad absolutely loved the

675
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Linus Tech's

676
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Drama that went down

677
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So he likes watching PC's be built

678
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And I was like you might really like this game

679
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
PC build simulator but he's not downloaded it yet

680
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And I'm trying to get him to do it

681
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Because I think he would actually thoroughly enjoy the game

682
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But like so he watches Linus Tech

683
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Tip to like vicariously

684
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Build PC's through him

685
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Because he likes the unique designs

686
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Or like the challenges he actually

687
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Really likes the challenge of building a good

688
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
PC because my dad built my PC

689
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
For me and he built his like

690
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
He's done it like three times for his

691
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Now

692
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And he did it once for me

693
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And then he also ripped out my

694
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah that was another time

695
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But it was a mistake

696
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Your dad sounds so cool

697
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I love my dad

698
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Like bogus champus

699
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I think my dad's definitely

700
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Like laid back and like

701
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You know I already kind of divulged

702
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
This information but my mom and dad

703
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Are punks and

704
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Are in their younger days

705
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You know these days they're kind of more

706
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Just working hard

707
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And the sister type thing

708
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But

709
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
They were punks and

710
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
If you were a punk back then

711
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It means you fucking leave

712
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let people live and fucking

713
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Let them be type shit and

714
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You know you're not

715
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You realize who the problem is

716
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And it's not the community

717
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The community's been diverted

718
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
To look at these problems that aren't real problems

719
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You know like the biggest example

720
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I can give you in the UK right now

721
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Is a terminology

722
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Called benefit scroungers

723
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
A benefit scrounger is someone who claims

724
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Benefits that might not necessarily

725
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Need it

726
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
However

727
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Counterpoint

728
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Billion

729
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Billion dollar companies

730
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Not paying taxes

731
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And someone getting less than

732
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Minimum wage via the government

733
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I wonder

734
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I wonder who the problem is

735
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
In this situation

736
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Curious curious

737
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And basically

738
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The people's

739
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Why is the landscape always

740
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Turns into tinfoil hats

741
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's not even tinfoil hats

742
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That's the worst part

743
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
That's the worst part

744
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's not

745
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Right I need to stop

746
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
But anyway

747
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
To be punk means

748
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Socially that you are aware

749
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
That community

750
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Good society

751
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Good government

752
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I don't know

753
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And also being

754
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Very wary of news media

755
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
If you haven't

756
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Noticed

757
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
News media

758
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Sways public

759
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Opinion public

760
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Approval

761
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Of certain things public thingies

762
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And all that

763
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Watches tinfoil hats

764
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We want them being good

765
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Not so sure about that one

766
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Wait

767
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Who's being good

768
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
No I'm not

769
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Billion dollar companies feel so bad

770
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Yeah

771
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I learned of a recent one

772
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Vodafone in Australia

773
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Got a 50 million dollar government grant

774
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
They

775
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Reported I think 13 billion

776
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Profit

777
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Do you want to know how much taxes they paid in Australia

778
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No

779
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm going to give you a hint

780
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's less than one dollar

781
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Oh

782
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But they get to make all that profit on the people

783
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
But yeah

784
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That

785
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And before anyone's like

786
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Strongy strongy

787
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You did that short where you complained about holding

788
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
30% back for the tax money

789
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Again again I would like to redirect

790
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Your fucking eyeballs

791
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And your wrinkly brain

792
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Billion dollar

793
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Billion in zero taxes

794
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But the little commoner

795
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The little peasant

796
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
That isn't even a droplet

797
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
In the sea

798
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Complaining about taxes is a problem

799
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Anyway

800
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I want to do that

801
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
0.99

802
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
You're giving it far too much

803
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Far too much

804
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Did you watch friendly George's

805
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Is it one about the quality of houses in Australia

806
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And is someone who has rented in Australia

807
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah

808
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Absolutely

809
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
It is disgusting not to mention

810
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
If I had a dollar for every real estate agent

811
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That was like oh this rentals

812
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Fine this rentals fine

813
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I'd be so rich

814
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
First things first

815
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Now when we all get condemned to hell

816
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Okay first things first

817
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Real estate agents you're going first

818
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Okay

819
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
First you can go into the worst part

820
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Of it because

821
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Bruv

822
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Why are they so slimy

823
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Honestly

824
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Don't upset yourself mummy

825
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I'm getting rabid

826
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I need to watch my gen mates

827
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
German politics starting to get torn up for the same thing

828
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Well

829
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You know how good the Belgian governments are

830
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Do you know how good the Belgian governments are

831
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Do you know if the Belgian government

832
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Gets

833
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Guilty

834
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Found guilty of corruption

835
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Everyone

836
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Has

837
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
To fork in

838
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Everyone has to fucking resign

839
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Like

840
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Noriboshi

841
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm so sorry but you're becoming a mod

842
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Get fucked

843
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Thank you very much fang

844
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Wait what am I trying to say

845
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Everyone has to resign if a scandal has occurred in Belgium

846
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And I'm like

847
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Belgium is probably the only country that does something along those lines

848
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Oh thank you

849
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Literally get right

850
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's only going to be like

851
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Bleh

852
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Literally you guys vomit when I'm not here

853
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And I vomit when I start getting too deep

854
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Into the rabbit hole

855
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Real answer

856
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Um

857
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I've been wrenched

858
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Are you in game

859
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
What are you doing here

860
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
You're in game

861
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Why are you in game

862
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't know you're in game

863
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Oh that's so good

864
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Hi

865
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You're a little nerd

866
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Um

867
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The way I see it is

868
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Well it has like 5 million dollar generational wealth

869
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Speaking generational wealth

870
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I have 20 million to my name

871
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I also have crusty socks

872
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Everyone's getting scared

873
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah let me try here sorry

874
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I wanted to be here to cheer you on

875
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Bro we're getting there we're almost there

876
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We're not we're not going to do this stream but we're almost there

877
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Unless I did an endurance stream

878
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Where I popped up another waiting room as well

879
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And just balled to the wall

880
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
There's no escape and ruinscape

881
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You only take breaks in between it

882
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Right

883
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Now that I've had my absolutely mental tinfoil hat

884
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Ran

885
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Will I quickly check Marshmallow before we

886
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Start watching my gen mates

887
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
In the background

888
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh my god I have

889
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
2065

890
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Marshmallows

891
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah

892
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah

893
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It's almost like the same beach

894
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It was like old school runescape

895
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It is a classic game

896
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I'm not sure if it's the most engaging to watch

897
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Like I mean

898
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sure for the community

899
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Or sort of like yeah play smart

900
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Do ASMR instead of fucking

901
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Do a little bit of skill and whine

902
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Eh

903
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I also really have no levels

904
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And no skills so I can't trade things to people

905
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh yeah you need like in order to

906
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Not be identified as a bot

907
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You need to do missions and stuff

908
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But to be honest the bots just do them anyway

909
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So

910
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Oh

911
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Reeflin said two hours ago

912
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Crying happy tears right now

913
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Listening to the pregnant with you early access

914
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
You did a fantastic job

915
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm so glad it was like

916
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
An emotional outlet for you

917
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I thought it was cute

918
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Hopefully

919
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I did

920
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Do like a little soft breathing

921
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
At the end as well just if someone wanted to fall asleep

922
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
In the womb if

923
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Edgeville the Denial Reeflin is not looking

924
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Too hot right now

925
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
That's actually really funny

926
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm glad we're all like on the same page

927
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
We're all like yeah fuck it let's fuck this one particular

928
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Reefling up

929
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I'm literally so cute

930
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Boom

931
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Eh

932
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Also it might have been the same month

933
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But Emmy also ovulated

934
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Why are we talking about my little sister ovulating

935
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
What's going on here

936
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What also it might have been the same day

937
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But Emmy ovulated on the 5th

938
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Maybe it's the same time you did

939
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Actually I will confess

940
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Emmy did

941
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Ovulate near the same time as me

942
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I think she started and then I did it

943
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I'm like fuck the Bluetooth device

944
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
She's connected

945
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I was like oh damn

946
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Shawnee can you tell us when you're ovulating in August

947
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
When it happens

948
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm trying to work it out and establish a pattern

949
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Oh I have bad news for you

950
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You can't get a pattern out of me

951
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I am

952
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I am rotating

953
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't

954
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It's not like it picks like the 14th

955
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Every month or whatever I'm rotating

956
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm just so

957
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm just so cool like that

958
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm not like the other streamers

959
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
My ovulation

960
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Cycles

961
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Absolutely

962
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Shotting behaviour

963
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Actual shotting sorry but it is

964
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Em

965
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Hi Shawnee, hi Weefling

966
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I got into your hit noses stream

967
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Finally I'm writing during the aftercare

968
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm writing during

969
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So this is fresh I missed your control

970
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
More than I thought I had

971
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I truly love you love me too and I mean that so much

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I've been listening to hypnosis over a decade

973
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And I once have I

974
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Drilled I mean you're drill

975
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I drilled, cried, or gone so far under

976
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I didn't have any intrusive thoughts the first two just happened now

977
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I felt the tiniest bit of wetness

978
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
On the side of my mouth and it almost snapped me out

979
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I wiped it off without thinking I barely remember

980
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What caused it but I remember you were saying something

981
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Really nice and kind and now

982
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I just feel relief and a cry so there's two

983
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Of my hypnosis how are you

984
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
No wait wait wait wait

985
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
How have you consumed the media for ten years

986
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And then me just going

987
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh I really want to have a go at this because

988
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I really enjoy hypnosis personally

989
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And I popped two cherries

990
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
No way

991
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I don't know I was

992
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Fucking hell that's such a compliment

993
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Thank you

994
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That's such a compliment

995
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I really hope you take the third one

996
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I feel a little warm all over I love you so much

997
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I love you too little wreath

998
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm so glad you can enjoy that

999
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Oh my goodness

1000
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Bro I was like so nervous to do it

1001
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Another reason

1002
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Aww

1003
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
That's what's mean

1004
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
That wreathlings the two crying stream

1005
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
2.0

1006
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
You can't be nice to me

1007
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
For those of you

1008
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Who weren't lurking in the shadows in the membership stream

1009
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It was just the

1010
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Classic ASMR stream

1011
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Going to that so after ten minutes

1012
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But basically a wreathling left me

1013
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
A really nice message

1014
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And it was like very sincere

1015
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
And heartfelt and it made me cry

1016
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Because

1017
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I'm like used to like

1018
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
All the tentacle and inco-references

1019
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Which I love and adore and like

1020
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I love teasing each other

1021
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Back and forth with it

1022
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And I just didn't expect it

1023
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And then

1024
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh someone's recommended me a list

1025
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Of games to play on

1026
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Bansley thank you so much

1027
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh my god thank you

1028
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Because I literally

1029
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I do not really play games

1030
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So thank you that's actually really helpful

1031
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Like unironically that's actually really helpful

1032
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Waa

1033
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Hi strongy I enjoyed the presentation

1034
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Streamy did it was nice to catch a vod

1035
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Oh I had to catch a vod

1036
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
That's okay don't worry about it

1037
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I know I don't really stream at the bestest

1038
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The bestest of times

1039
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And the worstest of times

1040
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't necessarily stream at

1041
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I wanted to bring up a correction though

1042
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's more than likely

1043
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You misspoke or

1044
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It meant something different

1045
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
When the swimmers finally reach the beach ball

1046
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
That's actually a really good one

1047
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
It's not the first one who reaches it

1048
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That starts the next phase

1049
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It's like a battle royale

1050
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This is absolutely true

1051
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And you're absolutely correct

1052
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I didn't want to get into the nitty gritty of it

1053
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But

1054
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
What briefly you say and he's absolutely true

1055
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
A load of

1056
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Swimmers can go around the beach ball

1057
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's Hoover's first to crack

1058
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The beach ball

1059
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But whenever you

1060
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You know you're trying to say it can get through

1061
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It is technically

1062
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yes you're absolutely right

1063
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
No you're absolutely just fine

1064
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Maybe it's just me diving further into the

1065
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Topic than you intended

1066
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
But damn does my actual order

1067
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Doesn't get me fixated on clarifying points

1068
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
No don't worry about it honestly

1069
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Please don't worry

1070
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
There's also a very high chance

1071
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That I say something wrong as well

1072
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm presenting it as like

1073
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Education and truth and all that

1074
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm very dumb so please don't worry

1075
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Don't worry at all thank you Reefling

1076
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Cheers no thank you Reefling

1077
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I wake up I think about you

1078
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Even after having awful nightmares

1079
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh Reefling you had a nightmare

1080
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Love you strongy love you too little Reefling

1081
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Hope you're okay after your nightmare

1082
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Always remember that your

1083
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Your nightmares

1084
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
That you have in the morning

1085
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It'll dissipate and then you'll start to forget them at night

1086
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like over time it'll dissipate

1087
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And obviously if it's fresh

1088
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
You'll notice it more but as

1089
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That beach ball literally are you an egg

1090
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Are you an egg

1091
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Give that

1092
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Reefling a honorific title

1093
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Every time you think you're worthless

1094
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Remember you fought a battle royale against

1095
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
A million of other years in one

1096
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
For y'all

1097
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And you also perish your entire

1098
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Bloodline

1099
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
As well in one

1100
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
A little swoop

1101
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I'm lucky that at the moment I'm done with the work

1102
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That strongy streams an hour later so I can just make food

1103
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And eat while I watch mommy

1104
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I think

1105
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That would be like

1106
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
A horrific timing

1107
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Unironically

1108
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Get off work

1109
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Obviously cause you're a guy

1110
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You need to do your post work jobby

1111
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So you sit on the toilet for 30 minutes

1112
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You know

1113
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Release a future

1114
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Wash your hands

1115
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Go fix yourself a quick dinner

1116
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Open up stream life's good

1117
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Simple as literally

1118
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yeah lucky

1119
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm so lucky lucky

1120
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm so lucky lucky

1121
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I'm so lucky lucky

1122
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
She knows

1123
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's all over tiktok

1124
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's literally sorry

1125
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I brainwrote so much

1126
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That I sometimes get tiktok for girls

1127
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Like instead of my usual memes

1128
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Posts and all that

1129
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I normally get like brainwrote

1130
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Like stuff

1131
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But sometimes it's like

1132
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It's really cringy but it's like

1133
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Ladies

1134
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Does your fella

1135
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Come home from work

1136
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And take 30 minutes

1137
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
In the bathroom

1138
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
To himself

1139
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And then all the comments are like

1140
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Oh my god yes

1141
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
What is with that

1142
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Why does he take so long

1143
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And I'm just like

1144
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I don't know maybe cause he wants to

1145
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Take a big fucking jobby in the comfort

1146
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Of his own home

1147
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Who wants to

1148
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I don't know

1149
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I don't know why it's so hard to be empathetic these days

1150
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I don't know why no one can put them

1151
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Imagine being out at work

1152
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Your bowels

1153
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Are pulling on you for 8 hours

1154
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Screaming for a jobby

1155
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You refuse to bomb the

1156
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Work toilet

1157
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
As a courtesy

1158
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You refuse to do that

1159
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And then you want to get home

1160
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
And you want to decompress from your day

1161
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And take a wee jobby

1162
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And go on your phone

1163
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And just tune out

1164
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Tune out for 30 minutes

1165
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Why is that so much to ask

1166
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Am I going mental? Am I going schizophrenic?

1167
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I literally feel like that zombie cat gift

1168
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Where there's a black cat and it's going

1169
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Like

1170
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Bro

1171
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Why is it so hard?

1172
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime

1173
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
That's why I take a jobby

1174
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
On company

1175
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I know I messed up I didn't want to swear

1176
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Big fat jobby

1177
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Being a good wage worker is like being a good

1178
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
As they say

1179
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I mean yeah

1180
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
No you're completely sane

1181
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Couldn't be me I'm not holding that

1182
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That's a char

1183
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Reefling

1184
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Bombs the work toilet

1185
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Doesn't say anything

1186
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Stinks out the entire floor

1187
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And then goes back to desk as if nothing happens

1188
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Everyone's like gagging and coughing

1189
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Like

1190
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
They're like someone's like crawling along the floor

1191
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
To get to the water cooler

1192
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
To try and like splash water on them

1193
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And all that

1194
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
You know the printer's just jammed

1195
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Even though it doesn't breathe oxygen

1196
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It jammed anyway

1197
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And in response to the orders that had been released

1198
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
In the office

1199
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That's funny

1200
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Biological warfare

1201
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah casually committing biological warfare

1202
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Via the toilet at work

1203
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Oh I thought we were talking about the different

1204
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Kind of mail time

1205
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
No no no a jobby's to

1206
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Be a big fat shite

1207
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
What did I walk in on?

1208
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh don't worry about it

1209
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Why guys need 30 minutes

1210
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
After work to just decompress

1211
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And take a big jobby

1212
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Shocking behaviour

1213
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Shocking behaviour

1214
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That crawling won't work

1215
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Heavier gases go lower

1216
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh

1217
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I thought smoke inhalation went up

1218
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Hmm

1219
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Cause I know what came out of that ass was fire

1220
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's absolutely disgusting

1221
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Don't ever speak again

1222
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Reefling

1223
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Reefling

1224
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I just wanted to ask

1225
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Why do you care about us so much

1226
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh no wait what does that mean

1227
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I'm not asking it to be mean or anything

1228
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Like

1229
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That it's something I'm really curious about

1230
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
It would be so easy

1231
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
To just do the bare minimum to keep us around

1232
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But you go above and beyond for people

1233
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And do

1234
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Things you're

1235
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Under no obligation

1236
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
To do but do anyway

1237
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Hold on I need to read this whole thing before

1238
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I bite into it

1239
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Obligation to do anything anyway

1240
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
But you put so much effort into

1241
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Making everyone happy and building people up

1242
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Even at your own expense sometimes

1243
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You don't treat men like there's some

1244
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Evil vile disease on this planet

1245
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You go out of your way to make them feel like

1246
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
They are in a safe space to relax

1247
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And enjoy what they like without

1248
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Condemnation

1249
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I hope my question doesn't come across negatively

1250
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
No okay now that you've specified that

1251
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The start caught me off guard

1252
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I genuinely think you're a beautiful person

1253
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So please don't change

1254
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Who you are

1255
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
At your core and keep up the hard work

1256
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Love you mummy, love you too Ruthlyn

1257
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Right let me reread the questions

1258
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Cause I don't even know where to start

1259
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Why do you care so much about us

1260
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
How do I even start

1261
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Ruthlyn how do I even start

1262
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Bro I'm gonna gap for like two hours straight

1263
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Why do I care so much

1264
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Where do you even start

1265
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Let's give that reef on a hug

1266
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
How do you even start

1267
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I don't even know how to tackle that

1268
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I mean it depends how far back you wanna go

1269
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
If you wanna go to last year

1270
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I could have been

1271
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Eating up and spat out

1272
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I was welcomed with

1273
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
An open hand

1274
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And I was literally

1275
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Explained how to be a

1276
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
VTuber okay

1277
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So rather than being like

1278
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
This disgusting hole

1279
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Once like some easy VTuber money

1280
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Or whatever terminology it was like

1281
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Okay fuck it one we're gonna

1282
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Toe my baby her ass and two

1283
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
We're actually gonna teach her how to be a VTuber

1284
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And it wasn't

1285
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Like I

1286
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Don't think you understand how

1287
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Easily I could have been

1288
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Like just

1289
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Absolutely dog piled

1290
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But you reeflings didn't do that

1291
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You were like oh no

1292
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Come on like right so this is how it's done

1293
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Like when you're talking

1294
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
In chat here's a rule you don't say

1295
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
People's name unless it's a donation or whatever

1296
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Okay and you guys had the patience

1297
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And then I did an ASMR stream

1298
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And I interrupted myself to

1299
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Respond to donos and then rather

1300
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Than being like man fuck this

1301
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So unprofessional I'm just gonna watch

1302
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Someone else that knows what they're doing

1303
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Instead it was like okay right next time

1304
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Stroni um

1305
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Leave it all to the end that's all you need to do

1306
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Just leave it to the end oh okay okay okay

1307
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Right um

1308
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
What's another thing right don't play

1309
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Games on stream that you have an inclination

1310
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That you're not gonna like oh right okay

1311
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Okay got it got it

1312
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I will not feel forced to play games

1313
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Or obligated to play games that I don't like

1314
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It creates an

1315
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Pleasant atmosphere okay okay what's next

1316
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Um

1317
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You know like oh baby

1318
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Stroni got grim now she's the grim

1319
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Aren't real and true

1320
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Um

1321
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Like these are examples of how

1322
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Open you guys were

1323
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
To me

1324
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And I will never

1325
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Be able to repay

1326
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That and I actually

1327
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Do genuinely mean that

1328
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
You might be like hey Stroni

1329
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You're going crazy doing like 100 collabs

1330
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Of VTubers and you know we get to see

1331
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
The video or you're doing like

1332
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
1k thank you

1333
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Or meme ASMRs of this or if we ask

1334
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
For an audio you're more than open to getting it

1335
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
The truth of

1336
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
The matter is

1337
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I will never

1338
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Be able to repay the true

1339
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Kindness that you have shown me

1340
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Unconditionally so the

1341
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
The best I can do

1342
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Is

1343
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You know say it out loud

1344
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
That

1345
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
What you've done for me

1346
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I can you know

1347
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Say that I love you because I think it's fair to say

1348
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
We love each other I don't I don't think anyone

1349
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Would come into stream and be like

1350
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh Stroni doesn't like the reef lens

1351
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Reef lens don't like Stroni like

1352
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I don't think anyone would ever

1353
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Say anything of that accord you know

1354
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Stroni was groomed into VTuber and it seems

1355
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
That apprentices surpassed the master

1356
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Stop this one

1357
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Um like

1358
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's like

1359
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Kind of at a surface level

1360
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But the deeper layer is like

1361
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I can never repay the way

1362
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
That I was so

1363
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Accepted because

1364
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But I'm also aware

1365
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
This is where like my kind of tinfoil

1366
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
This kind of comes in slightly

1367
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
It's not too much tinfoil but

1368
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm also aware of

1369
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Social rejection

1370
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I'm also aware

1371
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Of brainworms

1372
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
You guys actually taught me about brainworms because I didn't

1373
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I didn't understand it because I didn't really

1374
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Have it like if I don't have it

1375
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I don't understand it that well

1376
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Um

1377
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's my first time hearing of this as well as a new

1378
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You've left

1379
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You've let one of my favourite VTubers

1380
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
To bloom beautifully

1381
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
A lot happened in a month

1382
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's all I'm gonna say

1383
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Who's a fucking whirlwind

1384
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Anime wound plays RuneScape

1385
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh fucking delicious

1386
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Um

1387
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Where was I? I've lost my point

1388
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Ah where was I? Go back

1389
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Um right hold on

1390
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Let me go through your sentence again

1391
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's easy to do the bare minimum to keep

1392
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You around

1393
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I am so serious when I say

1394
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You do not have to give me money

1395
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You do not have to fucking

1396
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Feel obligated to show up

1397
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You do not have to be like

1398
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Oh strongy was nice to me so I'm gonna watch her streams

1399
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Even though I would rather watch another

1400
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
VTuber or another

1401
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Consume another type of content

1402
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I truly want

1403
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The best for you

1404
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And if in the moment the best

1405
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
For you is to consume another content creator

1406
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
So you can de-stress from the day

1407
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You can learn something new

1408
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You can get distracted from

1409
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The world at large

1410
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I don't get insulted like that

1411
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I don't get jealous like that

1412
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Um just

1413
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I just want the best for you

1414
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And I think we can all

1415
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Agree that

1416
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
In our kind of

1417
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
For those of us that are in western society

1418
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Obviously I can only really speak

1419
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
For Scotland if I'm being honest

1420
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Um

1421
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
I think we can all nod our heads and agree

1422
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And say there's definitely

1423
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Issues with socialization

1424
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And men and showing

1425
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Um affection

1426
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Being shown affection

1427
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Um as soon as

1428
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
As soon as you pass childhood

1429
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You know

1430
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
You no longer get hugs, you no longer get kissed

1431
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
On your cheek by family members

1432
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Um it's all handshakes and

1433
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Yeah yeah yeah

1434
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And you know it's almost as if

1435
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
As you grew up in your

1436
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Childhood you were told

1437
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
To

1438
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Open up like a pathway

1439
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
In your brain of

1440
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
You know you'll feel big emotions

1441
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
You'll be angry as you grow up

1442
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You'll feel this, you'll feel that

1443
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
But as soon as puberty strikes

1444
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It's like almost all of society go

1445
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Uh no hold on a minute

1446
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
You're not allowed to go down that pathway

1447
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You're not allowed to emotionally develop

1448
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
You're not allowed to socially develop

1449
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
To um feel the very

1450
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Natural need

1451
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
For attention

1452
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
The very natural need

1453
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
For community

1454
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
It's almost like you get shamed and shunned for it

1455
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You know

1456
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Um type thing

1457
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And I

1458
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Personally like this is just

1459
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
My two pennies and my two cents

1460
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Like

1461
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
If

1462
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Like you know

1463
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Uh

1464
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
It's hard like

1465
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I guess community, community is the word

1466
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Okay community is the word

1467
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
We might

1468
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Not be able to do a refland farm

1469
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Okay I might not be able to hook you up

1470
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
To the milken machines that's awful

1471
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
When I'm trying to be serious

1472
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But

1473
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
What I hope that I could offer you

1474
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
In exchange of

1475
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Um your time

1476
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Your attention as a sense of community

1477
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
A sense of belonging

1478
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
A sense of definitely not

1479
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Being used either

1480
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Um

1481
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I think that's very

1482
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Important I think there is

1483
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Um a lot of

1484
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Kind of stigma

1485
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
When it comes to a guy

1486
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Consuming a girl's content

1487
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
As well I could maybe go into that

1488
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
In an educational stream so

1489
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Terminology sorry I'm like proper

1490
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Going on a ramble here um

1491
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
So ah you're uncorking

1492
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
My balls I feel tears

1493
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Oh darling

1494
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
It's it's hard

1495
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
It's hard having

1496
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
That pathway closed off to you

1497
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
For how many years

1498
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
For from years upon years

1499
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Upon years you know

1500
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Feeling that societal pressure

1501
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Of you're a man

1502
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Um no more emotions

1503
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Um the only kind of

1504
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Emotions actually I've seen it on tiktok

1505
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
This is a kind of tiktok I see

1506
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Is a girl will record

1507
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Her boyfriend

1508
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And um he's like

1509
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Hugging up and being all snuggly

1510
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
In a baby voice with her

1511
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Um and rather than

1512
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
That being appreciated

1513
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
As a moment of affection

1514
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Where the guys defenses

1515
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Are all down it turns

1516
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Into oh you caught me on camera

1517
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Moment he he he oh no I'm a macho

1518
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Man and it's like no that

1519
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Moment is

1521
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
You know way to drop his

1522
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Barriers for the first time in

1523
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
However long because

1524
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Um you know you only get that unconditional

1525
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Love via family

1526
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Growing up now obviously

1527
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
You could come into the argument that

1528
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Some people have shit family it's just facts

1529
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It is an absolute

1530
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Dice roll gamba

1531
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Okay um

1532
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It is an absolute

1533
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Dice roll gamba if

1534
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Um you know

1535
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
It's your family

1536
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You're gonna look after you the way it is

1537
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So for me personally my family

1538
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Hug kiss on the cheek that's how you do it

1539
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
How you been missed you right

1540
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Let's you know get the family together

1541
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Because it's been a month it's been a while

1542
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
That's kind of the thing um

1543
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
You know um

1544
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Yes that's actually really

1545
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Important as well like

1546
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Emotional

1547
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Outlet

1548
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
What is socially acceptable

1549
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
For a man to experience

1550
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So a man's allowed to feel anger

1551
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But that emotion

1552
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Is such a negative experience in itself

1553
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You know I missed the start of stream

1554
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
This is gonna make no fucking context

1555
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
From what I'm going on about

1556
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Um a man is

1557
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Socially acceptable to experience

1558
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Anger now anger is a

1559
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Stressful emotion

1560
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It is a fight

1561
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Or flight

1562
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Reaction you make sure nervous system

1563
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Thingy and why is that the only

1564
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Thing that's like socially acceptable

1565
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Or why is it

1566
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
That is only straight up

1567
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Neutral

1568
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Neutral

1569
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
You're only allowed to be neutral

1570
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
You're only allowed to be angry

1571
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And you know

1572
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Like

1573
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm wondering if I can

1574
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Hold on let me see if I can pull up this chart

1575
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I'm not even kidding sorry

1576
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm like straight up going in the middle of an education stream

1577
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I'm like doing education

1578
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Straight up in the middle of this fucking thing okay

1579
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Right

1580
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Okay this is a

1581
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Looks a bit simplistic for the

1582
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Um

1583
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I don't know this one looks pretty complicated

1584
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
And it's a shitty website that has like a billion things

1585
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Oh god can I

1586
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I'm even gonna be able to read that

1587
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Um god there's so much fish on the floor

1588
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Geez I wonder if it's because of this

1589
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Cuttlefish

1590
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Okay hold on

1591
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Why is that even smaller

1592
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Bro this I'm

1593
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Oh well

1594
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Hold on you didn't hear that because my desktop is

1595
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Muted but I didn't let me save

1596
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
The image

1597
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Can I save this image

1598
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Or do I need to go on your fucking dodgy website

1599
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Oh get to fuck man

1600
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Get to fuck

01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh right I'm just taking a screenshot and fucking

01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
M.S. Pain I'm sorry I'm M.S. Pain

1603
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
But what is going on

1604
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I want to achieve one thing

1605
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000

Okay it's for kids

1608
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
But it applies to adults

1609
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Because adults are just growing up kids

1610
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Okay relax I know

1611
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Don't you have any stories trying to fucking save your children

1612

No mother fucker stop it

1613

That sucks just to happen

1615
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Did I show anything that

1616
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Was supposed to be shown I don't think so

1617
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I think it was fine

1618
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Jumped air I don't even know how that opened

1619
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Up on the floor

1620
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Dogs

1621
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I don't know if I did anything

1622
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I have no idea

1623
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
No not the curtain

1624
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Time is broken now

Wait I need to go back and see it hold on

1630
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000

Okay no nothing should

1635
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
As far as I can tell

1636
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
What a stupid fucking thing

1637
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000

Don't give me a heart attack okay right

1642
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Back to my

1643
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Massive rant literally this is all

1644
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Because of like one question

1645
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
It's not even a rant is it

1646
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
No it's not a rant that's not how it works

1647
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Okay so back on

1648
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Societal factors okay so

1649
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
What are men

1650
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Allowed to feel in society

1651
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And we have anger okay and if we look at

1652
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Anger look at what negative

1653
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Associated

1654
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Emotions come with

1655
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That like what the fuck are you talking

1656
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000

Timer is gone Bernal

1661
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Was not expecting deep emotional counseling

1662
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
This stream I'm passionate

1663
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
About I have to admit I'm passionate about it

1664
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Because

1665
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I have consumed these topics in the past

1666
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Where it's like

1667
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
You know women came

1668
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The

1669
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
They argue that like

1670
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Men have it easy and don't want to listen

1671
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
To anything that men might not have

1672
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Easy on and you know

1673
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I'm going to go out on a limb here

1674
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And say if someone without a willy

1675
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
If a guy with a willy you know

1676
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Tells me you know what

1677
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I actually really had a rough time

1678
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And then I read it again online

1679
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
And then I read it again online

1680
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
And then I read it for like the billion time online

1681
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Who am I going to listen to

1682
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Me who's had no experience having a winky

1683
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Or

1684
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The guys online that are like

1685
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Hey I have it rough hey I have it rough

1686
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
And it's like

1687
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
And especially sadness

1688
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
It has to be hidden

1689
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
It has to be hidden you're not allowed

1690
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
To feel sad you're not allowed to feel upset

1691
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You're not allowed to cry

1692
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Like fuck me at the most

1693
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Basic human instinct

1694
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Level do you know what crying actually is

1695
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
It's you getting

1696
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Stress out

1697
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's you getting stress out at the

1698
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Is the function of crying

1699
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Is to lower

1700
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The cortisol levels in your body

1701
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Because having a

1702
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Buildup of cortisol is

1703
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Bad for your body's function

1704
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Okay at the most basic

1705
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Level

1706
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Crying is to reduce your stress

1707
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And holy fuck

1708
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Societies like guys are not even allowed to cry

1709
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Like fuck it now

1710
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Like

1711
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
It is a bit much I have to admit

1712
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
It is a bit much so

1713
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
You know

1714
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
A community I feel like

1715
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I don't know it's like a deeper word than that

1716
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But holy fuck at least hopefully

1717
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I can offer some sort of outlet

1718
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And you know there's no judgment

1719
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And there's no this there's no that you know

1720
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Pop off mummy

1721
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Literally

1722
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
How's that going

1723
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's going good I'm currently doing a

1724
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Demonstration on

1725
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Why guys need jobbies for 30 minutes

1726
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And we've got an emotional chart

1727
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Of

1728
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yes

1729
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
No

1730
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I ain't crying in public though

1731
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Only angry a lot

1732
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Now

1733
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
If a guy is seen happy

1734
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
What's the first thing society says

1735
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
If a guy genuinely seems a static

1736
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
A happy

1737
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
What's the first thing society goes oh you've had a bj in the morning

1738
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Haven't you

1739
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
And it's like oh a fucking god

1740
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Can someone not just be fucking happy

1741
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Why does it have to be like some sort of

1742
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Seeking reward

1743
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Fucking

1744
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Sexual encounter type thing like oh you're happy

1745
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
You must have had you know a little cheeky

1746
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
What what

1747
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Or if you're too happy in the wrong way

1748
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Exactly no you said it

1749
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
You said it

1750
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
If you're too happy in the wrong way

1751
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
You're seen as

1752
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Seen as a homosexual because you're

1753
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Being effeminate in your emotions

1754
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And you are fucking

1755
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Mercy I'm so sorry you're coming in the middle

1756
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Of a schizophrenic rant from me

1757
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Okay I'm so sorry

1758
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Ohio

1759
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Type thing okay

1760
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
And then surprise

1761
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
You know are you allowed

1762
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
To be shocked are you allowed to say oh

1763
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
You know what I didn't know

1764
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That

1765
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Are you made to feel like a fool if you didn't know

1766
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Absolutely everything about something or would you

1767
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Rather be quiet and not make a mistake

1768
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Say something that might not

1769
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Be the truth but you honestly thought was

1770
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Like do you get ridiculed

1771
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Do you get ridiculed if you share something

1772
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
That you thought was right

1773
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Instead of just being like

1774
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Casually being told like

1775
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Oh actually it goes like this I think

1776
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Instead it's like

1777
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Oh you got it wrong you got it wrong

1778
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Oh say like

1779
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Like this all starts in high school

1780
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It's called secondary socialization

1781
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Is it schizophrenia if it's true oh my god

1782
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Oh my god Mercy's on the same page

1783
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh

1784
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Like so primary socialization

1785
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Is when your family has raised you

1786
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Okay your family and your most immediate

1787
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Caretakers have raised you okay

1788
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Secondary

1789
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Society is your

1790
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
High school experiences everything else

1791
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Your workplace experience that's why

1792
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Workplace also has a lot of bullying

1793
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Connotations the bullying

1794
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Does not end in high school

1795
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
I'm sorry to burst anyone's bubble

1796
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
But there

1797
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Will always be people

1798
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Who feel the need to

1799
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Put others down and if

1800
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
You're the one who gets picked on

1801
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
There's nothing

1802
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You can do about it in the workplace

1803
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Because then instead of the

1804
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Response of high school being like oh they're

1805
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Teenagers let it figure out it's

1806
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Oh yes there are all adults here

1807
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You can't be fighting like

1808
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
What do you want us to do yes there are adults

1809
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yes there are adults and it was like

1810
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Motherfucker that's not how

1811
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Socialization works

1812
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Making the environment hostile

1813
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
For one of

1814
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Anyway

1815
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So yeah

1816
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Where was I

1817
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
We'll go back to the question

1818
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I got here

1819
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Okay

1820
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But you go above and beyond

1821
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
For people and do things

1822
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Under no obligation so that's

1823
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Kind of coming back to me as an

1824
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Answer

1825
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I do feel obligated

1826
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
In terms of I will never be able to

1827
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Repay the favor so I repay

1828
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
The favor in any way I can

1829
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Okay I love mommy and she's right

1830
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
That's right you preach mercy

1831
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Amen hallelujah

1832
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Thank you so much Rissy

1833
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Love you too mercy my daughter

1834
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Mercy should have picked mercy

1835
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But that's kind of my

1836
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
My way of saying thank you isn't

1837
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Going oh thank you I appreciate that

1838
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
No I will say it if like if someone

1839
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Worshiped I do say your name and then

1840
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I say like thank you so much for

1841
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Going from there

1842
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But my way of saying thank you is

1843
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Like here's free to access

1844
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Content do you guys want

1845
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
A fun audio on the alt twitter okay

1846
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I'll write down that idea

1847
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
That's for me the way

1848
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
That I say thank you

1849
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
For me personally is like you get to

1850
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
See what you want that's how I do it okay

1851
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Mercy is doomed by that song

1852
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
No it's me that's doing it to her

1853
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
That's something that strong is the base

1854
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
My knees are breaking the foundation of the house

1855
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Are you going through the floor

1856
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You put so much effort

1857
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Into making everyone happy

1858
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
And building people up even at your own expense

1859
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I wouldn't say

1860
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
It's at my own expense

1861
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Unfortunately I can't think of an example

1862
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Of me going on a ramble

1863
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
That's at my own expense

1864
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
But I hope

1865
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I do build you guys up and make you happy

1866
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
You know you don't treat men like

1867
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
There's some vile disease on this planet

1868
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
No this is kind of the socialization

1869
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Again now I do

1870
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Want to warn all of you

1871
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Who consume

1872
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Any kind of media

1873
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
It is a multi

1874
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Billion

1875
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Dollar industry

1876
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Of rage bait

1877
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Of

1878
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Of things done against

1879
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
This happens to both sexes

1880
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Okay

1881
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
So

1882
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
If you scroll social media

1883
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
On a new account

1884
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And it identifies you as a guy

1885
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
It's going to push rage bait to you

1886
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Okay

1887
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It'll actually happen to my dad while he was here

1888
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
He was like Ostrone

1889
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Why is it showing me content like this

1890
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And I'd explain to him what the rage bait is

1891
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
What it is, what the hook is and all that

1892
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
And I was saying

1893
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You will watch the most

1894
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Ridiculous staged

1895
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Contents that look real

1896
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
And it's like

1897
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
You know like Reddit stories for example

1898
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Just off the top of my head

1899
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
The AI reading Reddit stories

1900
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That are like low effort content

1901
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
People are manufacturing stories

1902
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Of like my wife

1903
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Of 10 years

1904
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Left me because

1905
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I became bald

1906
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Now if you didn't know

1907
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Everyone's going to become bald

1908
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It's perfectly natural for guys

1909
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
To become bald

1910
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
The baldness gene is in men

1911
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
It also happens to women as well

1912
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
So sorry to hear if you've got it type thing

1913
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
But it's just a fact of life

1914
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It's a shame

1915
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
That it has such an effect

1916
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
But

1917
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Now listen to this point

1918
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Because it is such a sore

1919
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Aspect for some

1920
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
And this is true

1921
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
And it's okay to have your feelings hurt by this

1922
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
It's truly okay to be like

1923
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Fuck

1924
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It's natural

1925
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
If it didn't happen

1926
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You want to know the facts

1927
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
If it didn't happen it's more unnatural

1928
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
But because

1929
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It is such a insecurity

1930
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
That's the word insecurity

1931
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So just as for women the makeup industry

1932
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Is a billion dollar insecurity thing

1933
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And Botox and all of this

1934
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
As two

1935
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It's the same for guys

1936
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Okay and when it comes to factors like that

1937
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So rage bait is built upon this

1938
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
So the most common rage bait you will most likely see is

1939
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
My girlfriend left me

1940
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
My wife left me

1941
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
My fiance left me

1942
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And the most common

1943
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Things are to cheating

1944
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Are to

1945
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
No longer in love with you

1946
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
But it's not just no longer in love with you

1947
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It's the insecurity of like

1948
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Your baldness, your body's changed

1949
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
You've got an older type thing

1950
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
These are insecurities that manifest in guys

1951
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
And it's okay if it manifested in you

1952
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
That is what happens

1953
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Okay

1954
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
It's perfectly natural to be insecure

1955
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
What isn't

1956
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Good for you

1957
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
My darling reefling

1958
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Is letting it control

1959
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Your life

1960
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Okay darling, I'm serious about that

1961
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Now

1962
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
There's a lot of

1963
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Now I'm not just talking on rage bait

1964
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
But

1965
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
I do want to say

1966
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
It's much easier said than done

1967
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
But don't lock away yourself

1968
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
From the world because you're insecure

1969
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Okay

1970
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
The world

1971
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Is an absolutely stunning

1972
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
And beautiful place

1973
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Okay and

1974
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
There are so many people out there

1975
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
That will give you just as much

1976
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
As a laugh and a giggle as me

1977
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Okay

1978
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Please

1979
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I urge you in any context

1980
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Not just insecurities

1981
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
In any context as a being

1982
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Do not be the one

1983
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
That is holding yourself back

1984
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Via your ankle

1985
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Don't be grabbing onto your own ankles

1986
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
And stopping you from watching

1987
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Walking forward

1988
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Guy on tiktok interviewing women

1989
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Who are rich and eight feet tall

1990
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Perfect example of rage bait

1991
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I completely forgot about that

1992
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I couldn't give two shits about height

1993
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
So I'll always forget about that one

1994
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
You will be made to feel insecure

1995
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
About things you cannot control

1996
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
You cannot control the balding gene

1997
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
You cannot control your height

1998
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You spawn in with that

1999
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Again you spawn in with the balding gene

2000
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
You cannot control the way

2001
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
You physically look in the way your face is

2002
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
You are a

2003
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Absolutely beautiful

2004
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Amalgamation

2005
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Of all your ancestors

2006
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Who fell in love before you

2007
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Okay

2008
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Please understand

2009
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
When you consume social media

2010
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
You consume people

2011
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
With filters

2012
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
That you wouldn't even know

2013
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
You consume people who

2014
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Algorithm push

2015
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Pretty people

2016
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
This is true and this is

2017
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
That's how it is

2018
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Do not have a warped perception

2019
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
On reality

2020
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Especially if you might be a reefling

2021
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
That doesn't go outside often

2022
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
You work from home or maybe you are

2023
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Just being chilling at home

2024
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Please take what you see

2025
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
With a grain of salt darlings

2026
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Okay

2027
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Look at the sunlight

2028
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
The lights in the city sparkle

2029
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Did you notice the flower that's growing

2030
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
In between the sidewalk crack

2031
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
At the wall

2032
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
The world is beautiful and so are you

2033
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Exactly

2034
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yes

2035
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
You must be careful

2036
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Thank you

2037
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh reefling

2038
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Are you okay darlin

2039
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
You are more than welcome

2040
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
MNS

2041
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Thank you for the super chat

2042
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
It's

2043
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It's such a hard topic

2044
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
To tackle

2045
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Because it's not

2046
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Like it's not like

2047
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
It's a circle and we can be like

2048
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Okay this is everything in this circle

2049
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It is like the absolutely

2050
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Nightmare of a spider web

2051
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And how you even begin to talk

2052
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
About one aspect of it without

2053
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
You know trying to

2054
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Push through all these other aspects

2055
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
That come into it okay

2056
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I'm tearing up oh no I should have stopped

2057
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I don't want to make you upset darlings

2058
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
But yes

2059
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
The influence of social media is

2060
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Real

2061
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Who knew mercy could be so poetic

2062
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And who knew a cuttlefish would be

2063
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
More wholesome than all of society

2064
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Imagine the cuttlefish

2065
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Is lore which is to destroy

2066
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
All of humanity turns into

2067
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Reset all of humanity

2068
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I will bring you to a

2069
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
New age

2070
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Come one come aura

2071
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Don't lock yourself away

2072
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Because you're insecure

2073
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
All the heart-hitting kindness

2074
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And old school runescape I love the

2075
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
It's a combination for the ages

2076
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Combination

2077
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Got me feeling so many emotions

2078
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I came to cheer on it

2079
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
And I got a lot more

2080
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Oh no I'm sorry I'm sorry already

2081
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Sorry I need to stop

2082
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Destroyers with bliss

2083
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I think I understand now I get it

2084
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You go out of your way to make them

2085
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Feel like it's a safe space to relax

2086
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
And enjoy and

2087
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
What they like without condemnation

2088
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Okay now this is where I'm getting

2089
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
A bit tinfoil hat Eve

2090
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
It's not really tinfoil hat because again it's true

2091
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
So now

2092
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Let's tackle the terminology

2093
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Simp

2094
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Now it got banned on Twitch if you didn't know that

2095
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
That terminology got banned on Twitch

2096
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
The internet

2097
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Use it

2098
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Against men

2099
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Who enjoy content

2100
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
From women

2101
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
That's the most basic description

2102
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
You could ever do it

2103
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Now

2104
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It's used to

2105
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Again

2106
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Make you

2107
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Feel bad about

2108
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Simply enjoying yourself

2109
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Enjoying content you consume

2110
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And connecting with a creator

2111
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
That happens to be a chick

2112
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Again it is another

2113
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Kind of

2114
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Destroy society

2115
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
But when she learned the evils of the world

2116
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
She decided to save people as reeflings

2117
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Destroy the high table

2118
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Thank you tiny spiny

2119
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Even urban living can pose stress

2120
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It is

2121
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Please don't think like

2122
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I'm not got a job and paying taxes

2123
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I'm worthless in society

2124
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Motherfucker

2125
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
That's not how it works

2126
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
My darling

2127
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I assure you you do not have to be a cog in the

2128
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Aim

2129
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Your life has value outside

2130
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Of paying taxes to the federals

2131
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I assure you

2132
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Wholeheartedly

2133
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Your life has more meaning

2134
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Than

2135
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Shoving some money into the endless pit of

2136
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Taxes against the fucking porpoise

2137
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
You know

2138
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Don't worry about none of that if you're worried about that

2139
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I don't want to go to work today

2140
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
This is too confusing

2141
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Sorry

2142
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Things in needs is quite good

2143
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
One of the best things about

2144
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Other is all tags are welcome here

2145
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Not everyone should have to work

2146
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Oh wait until I get into how long

2147
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
You guys should actually work a week

2148
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
It's over

2149
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
It's over

2150
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Oh my god oh I'd love to do an education stream

2151
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
About like pre-improved capital

2152
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Are you good at me right now?

2153
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Stop

2154
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Aww

2155
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Do you realize how rare that combo is?

2156
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Now be the mother of my children

2157
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Plop plop plop plop

2158
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Gen 2 confirmed plop plop plop plop plop

2159
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Thank you Zarian for the tip

2160
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
168

2161
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I don't like how people

2162
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Excessive fan

2163
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Obsessive fan of power social

2164
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So I'm a dumbass I thought power social meant

2165
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
When they show up at your house and I was like

2166
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Ooh that's dangerous

2167
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I don't know the definition of power social

2168
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Very well so I can't talk on it

2169
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Um

2170
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
But I think the terminology

2171
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Is just dedicated fan

2172
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
I don't really

2173
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
For me personally I don't really like

2174
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Referring to you guys as fans

2175
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I'd rather just call you my response

2176
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Than a bit more personal than like fan

2177
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I feel like fan is like

2178
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
An idol on a stage

2179
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And you're in the audience with the glow sticks

2180
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Like that to me that's fan

2181
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Whereas like I'm looking

2182
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
At your profile picture

2183
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And I'm reading out what you're saying

2184
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Like a few like different

2185
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
There's levels and it's a little far

2186
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Now power social is a one sided relationship

2187
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Dreaming of labour

2188
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Is the biggest mistake they try and rope you into

2189
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Oh my god

2190
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Wait a minute

2191
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Nori kinda

2192
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
She's kind of spitting on the mic though

2193
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Kind of spitting on the mic

2194
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Yes I could go into the whole

2195
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
What skills all of that

2196
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Um

2197
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
A few streamers are standings for pals

2198
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Or that kind of thing that's power social

2199
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But then that brings up the question

2200
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Cause obviously I see a lot of things

2201
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
About how hard it is to make like

2202
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Friends as adults

2203
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Like and especially

2204
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
If it's outside drinking as well

2205
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Oh my god I've literally not watched one freaking

2206
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Vod of a genmey and we're already like an hour

2207
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
We've already blown past an hour and I've not even

2208
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Watched one second of a Vod

2209
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Um no no does that break

2210
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Oh it broke

2211
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Oh no it didn't

2212
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I don't know what broke

2213
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Something broke

2214
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Um she's licking at us

2215
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Literally with my eyeballs

2216
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Wait did I finish the question

2217
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
You know that

2218
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I hope my question doesn't come across

2219
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Negatively you're briefed for this and don't change

2220
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Okay thank you reefling

2221
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Thank you for um

2222
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Your question

2223
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I have no idea if I even answered the question

2224
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
If I'm being honest

2225
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Thank you so much I'm not even sure

2226
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I managed to get to the point

2227
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
If I'm being honest

2228
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I think I like somehow

2229
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Just went on a massive tangent for each

2230
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Did I answer it

2231
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Question work

2232
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Did I answer it

2233
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Did it? Okay okay

2234
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Right if we're satisfied with that

2235
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I'll take it

2236
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Dumbass honestly

2237
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
What dumbass

2238
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Maybe maybe not

2239
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Okay

2240
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Um something's helped

2241
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Johnny I'm so pent up

2242
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Literally the question was

2243
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Why the reefling

2244
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Stop

2245
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Stop

2246
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Now you're gonna make me cry

2247
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Stop

2248
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I'm pulling up the quote right now

2249
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I'm literally greeting stop

2250
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Stop hold on

2251
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Why the halfling quote

2252
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Are you squidding me right now?

2253
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Sorry to go back to balding

2254
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
But if reeflings are suffering from it

2255
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Ask your doctor about finasteride

2256
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
It regulates testosterone

2257
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Which in excess causes balding

2258
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
It's actually a miracle

2259
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Strani has a full set of hair

2260
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
With her level of testosterone

2261
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Wait because you guys are pumping testosterone into me

2262
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Thank you Zarian

2263
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Um

2264
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I think there's also

2265
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Something called mox

2266
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
It's not moxicillin

2267
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I think you

2268
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Put it in your hair

2269
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
No

2270
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Moxicillin is a penicillin

2271
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Don't listen to me that's an antibiotic

2272
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Shit it's something that begins with

2273
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
M that you put in your hair

2274
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
You can also use rosemary oil as well

2275
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Antibiotics for balding

2276
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Stop

2277
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Don't take antibiotics for balding

2278
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
That's a terrible thing

2279
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
You didn't know

2280
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Balding is actually because you produce so much testosterone

2281
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
That your body is like

2282
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I'm gonna explode

2283
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And that's true in me

2284
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Oh dumbass

2285
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Mixed

2286
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Minoxidil

2287
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Minoxidil

2288
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And you began with an M

2289
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
No don't use antibiotics

2290
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Use antibiotics

2291
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
When you have a bacterial

2292
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Infection

2293
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Normally a viral infection

2294
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Does not work with antibiotics

2295
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And it's causing the rise

2296
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Of antibiotic resistant

2297
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Thingamabobbers, okay

2298
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
If you've got a cough that's a virus

2299
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
If you've got the sniffles that's a virus

2300
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
If you've got pus oozing out of your body

2301
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
That is not a virus and you can get hope for that

2302
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Okay

2303
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
That's an infection

2304
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Okay

2305
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
N-A-E

2306
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Mummy is bald confirmed

2307
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Should I ask Nori for a bald toggle

2308
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And then you can see what I look like under all this hair

2309
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Oh wait no

2310
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I have video footage of me bald

2311
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
When I was getting made

2312
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
When the mecca was getting made

2313
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Thank you, Vulcan Dynasty

2314
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Am I going crazy in saying that

2315
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Spellt wrong from Star Trek

2316
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
If that was from Star Trek

2317
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
We all can

2318
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Sorry

2319
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Is mummy hair even hair or is it tentacles

2320
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
No but my alternates

2321
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Is going to have tentacles

2322
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I'm going to have you coming at my butt

2323
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Okay, sorry

2324
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
To get back on topic

2325
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
If I can

2326
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Find the quill

2327
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It's refusing to come out

2328
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Oh my god

2329
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Okay here we go

2330
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Mithrandir

2331
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Reefling

2332
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I don't know

2333
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Saruman believes that is only great power

2334
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
That can hold evil in check

2335
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But that is not what I have found

2336
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I've found that it's the small things

2337
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Everyday deeds of ordinary folk

2338
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
That keep the darkness at bay

2339
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Simple acts of kindness and love

2340
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
But why

2341
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Reefling

2342
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Perhaps it is because I am afraid

2343
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And he gives me courage

2344
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yeah

2345
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
That's how I would sum up

2346
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
My

2347
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Why the Reefling

2348
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
She just evolved

2349
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
She just didn't say where

2350
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I just spanked it in another

2351
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I wish I could engage more

2352
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
With the stream it sounds like the Reefling philosophy is strong

2353
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Don't worry about it

2354
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
You are welcome to lurk in the shadows

2355
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But don't say Shadow the Hedgehog

2356
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Or Amy is going to pop up from you

2357
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
My plot

2358
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Did you use this in the ASMR

2359
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Why did I remember it

2360
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I used it in

2361
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Pregnant with you ASMR

2362
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
If you are on Patreon

2363
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I said that cool

2364
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Shadow the Hedgehog

2365
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Sonic Heroes

2366
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Sonic Heroes

2367
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Sonic Heroes

2368
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I only want that

2369
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And then it all ends in 30 years

2370
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Do the Bilbo speech before please

2371
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I am going for another 30 years

2372
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Forget 4 more years

2373
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
30 more years

2374
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
30 more years

2375
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
30 more years

2376
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Amy said no

2377
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Play Sonic X Shadows

2378
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Day 1

2379
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I don't know that one

2380
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Hello

2381
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
We get

2382
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Oh he said hello not hello

2383
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Sorry

2384
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Speaking of hello

2385
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Here's the schedule for the week

2386
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
That's the emotional wellbeing chart

2387
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Yes I will finish up Sonic Heroes

2388
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I may actually

2389
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
100% the game

2390
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I may actually do

2391
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Because I've already done rows

2392
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
We're about to do Team Chaotic

2393
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I have done Sonic Heroes

2394
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
30 more years

2395
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I will be the first Guilf Vechuber

2396
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Is there a Guilf Vechuber

2397
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Can I take that title

2398
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Sorry can I take the title as the first Guilf Vechuber

2399
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Because you know

2400
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
These girls ain't as dedicated

2401
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
The emotional schedule

2402
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Schedule is the wheel of emotions

2403
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Like huge old granny's throwing

2404
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Virtual old bacha

2405
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
No wait that's so cute though

2406
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Good morning my E-Flings

2407
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I feel like my Scottish accent

2408
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Is going to really come back the older I get

2409
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Oh who's it going my wee E-Flings

2410
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Good morning

2411
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Are you ready from a blast from the past

2412
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Today

2413
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
We're going to play Black Ops 1

2414
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Campaign

2415
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
And later I'm going to record

2416
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
A wee ASMR

2417
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Of us making cookies together

2418
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I will be the cutest granny

2419
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Vechuber ever

2420
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Oh boss on

2421
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
You would never speak German

2422
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Oh bits of bits of

2423
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Do you know that old lady please

2424
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Yes

2425
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
She's been confirmed

2426
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Publicly to be

2427
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
In Elden School

2428
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Sick Elden School

2429
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I think I'm saying that absolutely horrifically

2430
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Well

2431
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Granny's Gummars

2432
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Excuse me

2433
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Did my eyes deceive me

2434
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Does that say Granny's Gummars

2435
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
You're getting timed out for 10 seconds

2436
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
For that one chief

2437
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
That was foul

2438
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I literally manually tamed you

2439
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Out myself for that comment

2440
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
That was foul young man

2441
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
That's strong behaviour

2442
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
They need to do that again

2443
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
They need to do that again

2444
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Oh no

2445
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Wait with that

2446
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Granny Granny Gummars

2447
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I literally hears me like

2448
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Such a cute old boss on

2449
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Son and then

2450
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I get fucking Granny Gummars

2451
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Gummars

2452
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
No

2453
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
He took one for the team coming out without one

2454
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Elden Scrolls is my favourite

2455
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Stop Eldar

2456
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Scrolls are Elden

2457
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Ring

2458
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
That was funnily farewell

2459
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Spank

2460
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I think Cure Dolly was an older woman

2461
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Hmm

2462
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Chat reflects this

2463
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
How dare you

2464
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
No you're not becoming

2465
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Queeflins again

2466
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
I liked all the other variations

2467
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
That these came up with

2468
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
It was very cute

2469
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Right I'll make you a deal

2470
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
At the two of her mark

2471
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
We'll actually watch my

2472
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Watch Genmate Vods

2473
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Skyrim Granny confirmed for Gen 2

2474
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I mean

2475
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I think she'd be down

2476
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Sorry but I think she was

2477
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And she can like

2478
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Play all the mods and stuff

2479
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
No

2480
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Where are the Short Kinglings

2481
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Oh that's so cute

2482
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Oh yeah

2483
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
While we're talking about Ragebait

2484
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
That one gets done all the time

2485
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Sorry to kind of backtrack a wee bit

2486
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
That Ragebait gets done all the time

2487
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Where it's like

2488
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
If he doesn't make quarter of a million

2489
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
US dollars

2490
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Every week

2491
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I don't want him

2492
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And obviously the girl's been scouted

2493
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
For how pretty she looks

2494
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And then

2495
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
What a guy's takeaway is

2496
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
If you do not

2497
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
If you have the glasses on

2498
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Where you do genuinely not know

2499
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
What Ragebait content is

2500
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
You're gonna be left

2501
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Feeling like

2502
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
What the fuck

2503
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Is this really

2504
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I

2505
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Sent you a picture

2506
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Is management bullying me

2507
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
What the fuck

2508
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I make you all this money and you're fucking doing

2509
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
What

2510
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
What

2511
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Oh no

2512
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Oh no

2513
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Oh no

2514
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Oh my god

2515
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Oh my god

2516
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Would you still love me

2517
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
If I didn't use moxicillin

2518
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
On my head

2519
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Even though that's not the right one

2520
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
My eyes

2521
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Honestly but look you can see my ears though

2522
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
See I told you I don't have normal human ears

2523
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I have they're a little bit pointed

2524
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Almost look like a vampire wee bit

2525
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
If you take away my hair

2526
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I don't really look as cephalopod-esque

2527
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But my hair gives an indication

2528
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
I like cuter bald

2529
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Stop bald stream when

2530
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Honestly

2531
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
There's three round things

2532
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
In this picture

2533
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
If you know when I'm shinin'

2534
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
A vampire

2535
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Squid honestly

2536
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Bald

2537
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Shawnee in her

2538
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Oh my god I can't say that

2539
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I'll have the same heart of gold

2540
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Okay let's pop away

2541
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Right thank you for your tip

2542
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
She's going down the stairs

2543
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Okay that's actually

2544
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So true for the random thing

2545
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I'll pop that there in case I put something in its place

2546
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
That is hilarious

2547
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Thank you I like you cut G

2548
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Thank you Anon for spanking me

2549
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
On the back of my bald ass head

2550
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Bring her back now almost 18k

2551
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Stop stop the ASMR debt rises

2552
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
I can hardly keep up I'm literally uploading

2553
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Pregnancy ASMR and then

2554
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I'm gonna try and edit

2555
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
My side collab and then

2556
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
I'm gonna try for the snowberries

2557
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
The AC one out because it actually wasn't that bad to edit

2558
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
So snowberries

2559
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Potentially

2560
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
A snowberry warning

2561
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
You might have an ASMR roleplay

2562
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
From AC

2563
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
But please do not hold me to that

2564
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Because I am

2565
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
About to do an endurance stream

2566
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And I also

2567
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I'm also

2568
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Kind of going back

2569
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
To prioritizing my content a little bit

2570
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I put a lot of my stuff on pause

2571
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
To help the girls out but I'm gonna

2572
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
We've got a meeting this week

2573
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
And I'm gonna tell them

2574
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Like if you're gonna leave me to do

2575
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Stuff for you

2576
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I'm gonna do it eventually

2577
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
But it's gonna be delayed because I put a lot of my stuff on

2578
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Pause

2579
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
To enable them but now it's kind of time for me

2580
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
To be like hey ho

2581
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
You know how you wanted that thing

2582
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I actually know

2583
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
You have editing skills

2584
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
You know like that kind of thing

2585
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So what's the sequel to the pregnancy ASMR

2586
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Strongly gives birth to a hotfish

2587
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I'm not gonna do a freaking birth

2588
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Like no

2589
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I doubt anyone would even do that

2590
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I feel like that's like really

2591
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
You will need to do logarithmic milestones

2592
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Next to handle the ASMR

2593
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
No, so I have a lot of stuff

2594
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Just sitting there waiting to be recorded

2595
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Or waiting to be uploaded

2596
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
But thanks to YouTube giving me a warning

2597
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
For breathing in the air

2598
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I would like to remind everyone who doesn't know

2599
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I uploaded

2600
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
A video of me

2601
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Clapping with

2602
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
My hands ASMR, okay

2603
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Ah, the video did not get removed

2604
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Because of that

2605
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
The video got removed because I breathed

2606
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
In the ear of the microphone

2607
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Fast

2608
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
So I know

2609
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I'm too scared to upload anything

2610
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
That I'm like unsure of

2611
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So I need to wait

2612
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Until the warning is off my channel

2613
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
To then I can start like uploading

2614
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Cause like I've got burp ASMR

2615
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Waiting to upload

2616
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Well you were clapping with your hands

2617
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Why would it get, yeah

2618
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Yeah, yeah, my hands, of course

2619
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I'll need to get going now, see you later

2620
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
See you later alligator in a wild crocodile

2621
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I'll still be here

2622
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
It's an endurance, so if you need to sleep

2623
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Or you need to catch up on some household tasks

2624
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Or you need to prepare yourself some food

2625
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Please don't worry, I'mma be here

2626
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Oh no, breathing, that's too obscene

2627
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Literally

2628
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
If they remove the pregnancy one, no

2629
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
So there's actually nothing wrong with the pregnancy one

2630
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
There's nothing offensive

2631
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
There's nothing weird about it

2632
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Now, I'm sure you can be like

2633
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Oh it's weird because

2634
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Like you're literally pretending that

2635
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Reefland's in the womb, but it's cute

2636
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Like sorry, but it's kawaii name

2637
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Like, you know, Ohio it's kawaii name

2638
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
You know what I'm saying?

2639
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
You can't know what I'm saying, like it's actually kawaii name

2640
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Right, I'll refresh Marshmallow

2641
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
And I'll try and blitz through them, okay

2642
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You're supposed to be

2643
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
The pregnancy was supposed to be cursed

2644
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
But it was wholesome, yeah

2645
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I can't wait to see YouTube's reaction to it

2646
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Is it? Yeah

2647
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
If we remember it, we're right

2648
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I can't say anything weird about it

2649
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Wasn't there a pair of vTubers that streamed

2650
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
They birthed their first child like a script?

2651
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I had no idea

2652
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
That's bizarre

2653
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Okay, Marshmallow

2654
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Hi strongy, this might be a bit too real

2655
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
But I need to get it out of here

2656
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Should we do a cathartic street?

2657
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
It's the word cathartic, hold on

2658
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
cathartic

2659
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
cathartic

2660
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
cathartic, providing

2661
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
psychological relief

2662
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
through the open expression of strong

2663
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
emotions

2664
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Would you guys like a cathartic stream?

2665
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Or would you like me

2666
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
to, if there's any Marshmallows

2667
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
that appear to be

2668
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
cathartic, should I not

2669
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
say them out loud and read them

2670
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
personally?

2671
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I was calling a confetti

2672
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
That did it, why am I not

2673
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
surprised it was calling a confetti

2674
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Fuck it

2675
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
She's hilarious, honestly

2676
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I believe even Narissa from

2677
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Holo wants to do a birthstream

2678
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I love cathartic

2679
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Ready or more

2680
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
What you read

2681
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
doesn't tell the entire meaning of cathartic yet

2682
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Did I not say it?

2683
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Oops, I said it wrong

2684
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I've no got a clue

2685
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I'm just going off of

2686
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Google

2687
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
smile

2688
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Isn't that what we're doing right now?

2689
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I mean, I guess

2690
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Yeah, I don't know if I can

2691
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
read these ones out

2692
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I'm gonna be on

2693
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
you

2694
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I'll

2695
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I'll read

2696
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
the ones that I don't think

2697
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I'll read them personally

2698
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Does that make sense?

2699
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Yeah

2700
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

2701
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I don't think anyone would ever send

2702
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
you a marshmallow if they didn't

2703
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
trust you

2704
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Yeah

2705
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Question from one of the girls

2706
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Are we allowed to mention bandsly streams

2707
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
on the schedule since they get uploaded?

2708
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
No

2709
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
It would have to be

2710
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
put on the

2711
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Patreon

2712
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
version that goes on their alt twitter

2713
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
They can't mention it on their schedules

2714
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
It cannot be mentioned on schedules

2715
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
It's inappropriate conduct

2716
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
But it can be mentioned on their Patreon alt posts

2717
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Okay, the blue side

2718
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Real and true

2719
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
The girls at me in the discord

2720
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
and I'm just straight up going on a massive rant

2721
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
about the Injustice Society

2722
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Okay, no, they're literally

2723
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
AC's like

2724
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
How would we go about announcing that or even talking about it?

2725
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I think

2726
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
AC's very excited to

2727
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
do this little bandsly moment

2728
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Right, I've closed that off because I don't want any leaks

2729
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I bet you

2730
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I'll be the first one to leak something from the fucking Pishon discord

2731
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Honestly, I'll be that twat bag that does it

2732
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Oh my god, sorry, I need a fart

2733
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Can you give me one second?

2734
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Oh

2735
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I didn't have to

2736
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I didn't have to douse the

2737
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
loaf of bread and water just so you guys know

2738
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I did it naturally

2739
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
and a lot came out of me with this stuff

2740
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Hi, Strony, let me just say that you

2741
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
cooked with Veal. Oh, thank you

2742
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
They're based on all my fashions

2743
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Every channel

2744
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
brings AC

2745
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
and

2746
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
her

2747
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Snowberries give men a platform where they can have

2748
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
a little one who wants to rely on them

2749
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
All men like to be seen as a provider

2750
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Ooh, we're getting an anopsis

2751
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
on a

2752
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
ad?

2753
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Does that just accidentally add someone?

2754
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I don't know

2755
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
All men wants to be seen

2756
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Mercy brings a woman who's obsessed over you

2757
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
No matter how crazy she makes you

2758
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
She once loved so badly

2759
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
that someone loved so badly

2760
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
they looked past murder

2761
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Emi gives the one who is seen as the

2762
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
gender, it's a place to belong

2763
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Eh

2764
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Azura gives those who have an inner child

2765
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
inside that would never let a chance

2766
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
to rest and be pampered without judgement

2767
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Where's Sheevee?

2768
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Did you forget about Sheevee?

2769
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
What?

2770
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Did you

2771
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
forget the Sheevee? Wait, am I

2772
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
blind? I see Mercy

2773
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Emi Azura and you Miss

2774
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Ronnie Cotter's our genius to brought them all together

2775
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
I'm going to blow

2776
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
your mind, okay?

2777
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
There's a 6th member of

2778
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Vilaura and I'm so excited to share her

2779
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
with you, her name's Sheevee

2780
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Cottonbum, she's

2781
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Milf Bunny

2782
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Dominatrix, she's also a girl

2783
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
failure, you're gonna love her, her link

2784
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
is in the description, I've

2785
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
blown your mind that there's actually a 6th

2786
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
member of Gen 1 Vilaura which is fantastic

2787
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
What's that girl

2788
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Vilaura?

2789
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
The secret 6th member of

2790
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Vilaura, true

2791
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
I think, I think, I think Reeflin just forgot

2792
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
to, I'm just

2793
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
teasing you Reeflin, please don't panic

2794
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I'm teasing you, I know you

2795
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
you've probably just mistyped and

2796
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
accidentally deleted the paragraph

2797
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
or whatever, the sentence on Sheevee, please

2798
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
don't worry, Sheevee said that one

2799
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
6th member, Lee?

2800
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Did they mention Mercy? Yeah, they said Mercy

2801
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Mercy brings

2802
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
a woman who is obsessed over you, no matter how

2803
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
crazy she may seem, some

2804
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
want love so badly, they can

2805
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
look past, murder

2806
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I have terrible news for the

2807
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Senpais, it kind of all ends

2808
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
the same with Mercy at some point

2809
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
or another, the

2810
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
6th shouldn't hide in somewhere in the school

2811
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Wait, what's wrong?

2812
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
M

2813
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000

2817
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000

2819
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
What mummy, if you want

2820
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
a good laugh, just keep some

2821
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
absolutely ridiculous tabs open

2822
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
in your browser so if it leaks

2823
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
everyone has a good time

2824
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000

classic stop, what?

2826
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000

2827
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000

2828
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000

And then you should feel very ashamed

2833
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
You're not able

2834
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Thank you

Andrew

2841
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Hi strongy, if you want

2842
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
kids, if so, how many?

2843
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
My nipples are going to remain

2844
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
pink, thank you for asking

2845
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
As for

2846
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
strongy

2847
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
strongy is going to

2848
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
birth

2849
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
6 plus 6, which is

2850
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
6 plus 6 is 12

2851
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
and plus 5

2852
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
is 17

2853
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
right?

2854
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I need 17 children from you, do you think you can

2855
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
bear that for me?

2856
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Do you think you can have that responsibility

2857
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
of clapping when it's my ovulation time?

2858
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
17, she can do math, yay!

2859
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I had to put only 17

2860
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I cannot go further

2861
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
than a gen 3, are you joking me?

2862
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I'll be

2863
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
my

2864
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
badly packed

2865
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
kebab would be whistling

2866
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
by the time I got to the 17th child

2867
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I don't think I need any more than

2868
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
a 17, I'm going to be shattered

2869
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
okay

2870
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
the wind

2871
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
tunnel, a chance to close up again

2872
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
about Jesus

2873
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
mommy, you have no idea

2874
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
riefling, sorry, mommy, riefling

2875
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
you have no idea how low quality

2876
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
most hypno content creation is

2877
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
someone with genuine interest

2878
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
who isn't after the easy money

2879
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
or

2880
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
degrading offshoots like

2881
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
abadal, abadal?

2882
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
what's abadal?

2883
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
adult baby diaper

2884
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
what?

2885
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I popped, I popped, I'm level

2886
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
94

2887
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
we popped rieflings

2888
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
level 94

2889
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
abadabadingdong

2890
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
we popped it

2891
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
94

2892
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
only

2893
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
5

2894
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
9

2895
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
we did it!

2896
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
and we've already burnt through

2897
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
3000 wines already

2898
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
self-wetting

2899
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
is a rarity for those of us

2900
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
who have been in the space a long time

2901
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
can't wait to see you go

2902
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
yeah, I have to admit

2903
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
whilst going on my travels

2904
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
of looking at what other content creators do

2905
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
in particular

2906
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
can I, I'm just going to say

2907
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
how it is

2908
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
there's a lot of sophistication

2909
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
like, a lot

2910
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
of like

2911
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
astronomical numbers

2912
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
of it

2913
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
okay, you know, there's a lot of it

2914
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
like, a lot

2915
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
okay, but that was just, that's just my content

2916
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
oh, they've got another hypnosis comment

2917
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
hell yeah, sorry

2918
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
can I be an ego Andy for like 5 seconds

2919
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I had no idea how well

2920
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
that hypnosis stream was going to go down

2921
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
and I like feel so

2922
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
confident now

2923
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
what color are your underwear today

2924
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
um

2925
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
it's the same from yesterday

2926
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
the purple ones

2927
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
if that's gross I can take them off

2928
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I'm sorry, it's the same ones as yesterday

2929
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
I don't know if that's gross

2930
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
or not, marinate in

2931
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
pretty much, pheromone max

2932
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
then just take them all

2933
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
hahaha

2934
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
sniffer, honestly

2935
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
uh

2936
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
mummy was rewatching the John Wick Vod

2937
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
since I missed watching the first few movies

2938
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
and you and something came up

2939
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
how's the toe

2940
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I've now got a toenail

2941
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
it's healed

2942
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
it's pretty much healed

2943
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I can touch it

2944
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
the sensation is new

2945
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I did

2946
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I didn't really want to get into it too much

2947
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
when I had the procedure

2948
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I could still feel pain

2949
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
unfortunately the anesthetic didn't work

2950
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
and it was pretty

2951
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
rough

2952
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
so I didn't really want to talk about it

2953
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
when it just happened but

2954
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I've healed up nicely

2955
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I don't have to do bandages or anything

2956
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
anymore

2957
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
it's getting used to the sensation now

2958
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
it's quite strange

2959
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
merci's pheromone max in 2

2960
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
the senpai's will be happy

2961
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
it really didn't grow brat

2962
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
grow back, no

2963
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I'm ill-fee toeless

2964
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
but it's okay

2965
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
but what did papa ink think about

2966
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I never told him I was too embarrassed

2967
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
oh by the way

2968
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I got a pedicure

2969
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
and it resulted in me losing a toenail

2970
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000

2971
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000

2972
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I never explained that to him

2973
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
but I showed him like pretty much everything else

2974
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
that I've been doing like on streams and that

2975
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000

we watched the mech assault stream together

2978
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000

2979
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
laughing at me panicking on the bridge

2980
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
he was like

2981
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000

2982
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000

2983
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
playing this map and I told him like

01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
I actually only remember me replaying

2985
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000

2986
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000

my heart to see it go

3002
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
it's completely up to the girls

3003
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
what they'd like to leave off or take down

3004
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000

you were too perfect and adorable in that stream

3010
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
um there may be

3011
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
a multitude of factors on why

3012
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
the girls would like to take something down

3013
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
um it was too

3014
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000

says it was too saucy that is an example so one

3017
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
example is dmc

3018
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
another example is going a bit too far

3019
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
by accident

3020
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
another example

3021
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
um could be

3022
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
that someone's trying

3023
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
to be malicious in something they said in a

3024
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
clip and they just want to take the whole thing down like

3025
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000

01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000

01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000

mersey's

3046
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
plans

01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
um better to

3049
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
take it down then get a strike so

3050
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
mersey doesn't have a warning on her channel

3051
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
so even if she was a naughty saucepan

3052
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
she would actually

3053
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
get a warning first

3054
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
um azura

3055
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
me and myself are waiting for

3056
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
her warnings to expire

3057
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
um it literally is in September

3058
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000

3065
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000

3068
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
and I thought it was so

3069
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
good but I'm too scared to upload it in case

3070
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
youtube are like

3071
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000

3072
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000

don't want them to look into my history and be like

3084
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000

youtube no longer need to do a

3089
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
one two three strike system and then your channel is gone

3090
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
if youtube look at your channel

3091
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
and they find sufficient

3092
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
evidence to suggest that it's

3093
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
based on

3094
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
that kind of content alone

3095
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000

after a very loaded conversation

3259
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000

02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000

3281
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
andy to my own gen mates because

3282
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I don't have enough time to watch

3283
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
my darling gen mates

3284
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
um

3285
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
yes if a reefling wants something personal to be

3286
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
allowed to be read they can always put it in the message

3287
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
absolutely yes oh is that what you mean by

3288
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I keep using it

3289
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
is it wrong

3290
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
do I keep using cathartic wrong

3291
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I think I'm using it in the wrong context

3292
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
I'm so sorry is there a lot of trauma

3293
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
dumping no there's not a lot

3294
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
of outlets for reeflings

3295
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
to kind of be like this is what's going on

3296
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
or this is what's been weighing on my mind so

3297
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
if you want to use my marshmallow for it you can

3298
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
but out of respect I'm not gonna

3299
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
um say it watch streaming it

3300
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
look at the pinned chat

3301
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
it should be

3302
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
by sheebie cotton bottom

3303
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
bum

3304
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
you should collab with azura, emmy and mersey

3305
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
nothing is wrong so originally

3306
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
they were supposed to play uno

3307
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
but everything blew up in their face

3308
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
basically

3309
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
um

3310
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
yeah

3311
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I can't wait for your reaction she'll love them

3312
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
azura was so unhinged at one point

3313
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
munkah yes munkah yes

3314
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
goodbye to those who have to go

3315
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
um

3316
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
uh

3317
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
yeah

3318
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
okay

3319
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000

3322
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000

3323
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I've never seen an uno stream work correctly no matter what

3324
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I've seen holo live pull it off

3325
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
and I'm like fuck yeah

3326
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
and egauda came back for it she was like commenting on it

3327
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000

3328
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000

02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
so if you look top left

3330
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
on my screen right now

3331
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
the vod should be

3333
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000

3336
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
about it

3337
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
holo live didn't pull off easily

3338
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
the day was so fun every girl made a thumbnail

3339
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000

I've ever went through heavy emotions

3343
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
aww okay I think I'm

3344
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I'm definitely not saying the word right

3345
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
when I'm saying it I'm sorry to anyone

3346
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
there'll be some linguistic refling

3347
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
that's like oh my god women

3348
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000

3349
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000

02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000

I'm not playing the audio or anything

3364
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
but you will be able to see

3365
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
the little timer in case

3366
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
we're out of sync

3367
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I did not realise

3368
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
how outrageous I had made the loading screen

3369
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
for sheeby

3370
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000

3371
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
so it looks like she

3372
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
well I was gonna

3373
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
watch it on mersey's

3374
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
channel

3375
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
but I couldn't find it

3376
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
maybe need to show her the ropes of

3377
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
what youtube find good or bad type thing

3378
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000

02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
model skin colour now

3386
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I think it should be her now

3387
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
I don't know if she's fully using the model

3388
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
when she uses like both attachments

3389
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
sheeby goes reverse to white

3390
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
again fucking ridiculous

3391
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
literally whitewashed mottlin talent

3392
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
like fucking cringe man

3393
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000

3394
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000

02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000

talents right off the bat

3398
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
but she now has

3399
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
a much more reflective

3400
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
skin tone colour

3401
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I don't know what you want to call it

3402
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
which I'm very happy about

3403
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000

3404
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000

we are reacting to a vod of my gen mate

it is pinned in

3462
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
the chat

3463
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000

02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I'll use text

3467
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
and text

3468
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
React

3469
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000

Oh wait, oh good, that's the first question, make me nervous, I wasn't even in the stream!

3474
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:37,480
Oh that's tiny now, oh it's so blurry because it's so tiny, hold on, hold on.

3475
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,480
I'm American, I don't care, whoa!

3476
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:48,480
What was that?

3477
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:55,480
What were they asking?

3478
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:04,480
Wait, maybe I can like do it long.

3479
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:17,480
Okay, they all see the fallacy issue with that thing as well.

3480
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:25,480
Aw, evening, that's so good.

3481
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,480
It's too far apetics, stop it.

3482
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:35,480
Wow.

3483
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:47,480
I love this too, it's so scuffed already.

3484
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:59,480
Correct translation of Ubisoft can be found on Wikipedia as far as I can tell.

3485
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:03,480
Ubisoft, oh no, it is right.

3486
02:13:03,480 --> 02:13:16,480
Scuffed accent, and me.

3487
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:18,480
Okay.

3488
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:38,480
Okay I'm with Amy on that one, not bothered with the sun, it's dangerous.

3489
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:55,480
Fucking hell, what are these questions?

3490
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:59,480
Is the sun even visible in Scotland? No.

3491
02:13:59,480 --> 02:14:05,480
I came to Australia with a vitamin D deficiency, severe vitamin D deficiency.

3492
02:14:09,480 --> 02:14:14,480
Aw, they must have been so tired trying to get the fucking Uno game to work.

3493
02:14:16,480 --> 02:14:18,480
Mercy.

3494
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:35,480
Okay Azura, the mother, literally coming in this way.

3495
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:48,480
What? Mercy?

3496
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:56,480
She wants to eradicate an entire country?

3497
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:04,480
I'm on Android, oh I'm so sorry, it's gonna make no sense this stream, I'm so sorry.

3498
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:08,480
Shibi might be coming online, she might be online by now actually.

3499
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:18,480
Oh, Amy! Amy!

3500
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:21,480
I need to fucking clip that, that's hilarious.

3501
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:26,480
Mercy says the joke, she's like, I'm just kidding, Amy, no destroy France at once.

3502
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:29,480
I need to clip that, that's hilarious, what the heck.

3503
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:36,480
She has no qualms, I'm going berserk.

3504
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:40,480
Oh no, Shibi's taking the day off today.

3505
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:44,480
Okay, Amy might be coming on later, question mark.

3506
02:15:44,480 --> 02:15:47,480
I'm not sure.

3507
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:50,480
I can't remember everyone's schedule.

3508
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:57,480
She predicted the Olympics.

3509
02:16:20,480 --> 02:16:24,480
What, from death? Are you talking about death now, aye?

3510
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:31,480
Not too late, nyeh.

3511
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:42,480
We've started watching the first GenMeatVod, it's pinned if you want to watch along at the same time, that little timer is how far we're in.

3512
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:53,480
Bruh.

3513
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:59,480
Aww.

3514
02:16:59,480 --> 02:17:04,480
My dad lost 50 quid, Annie somehow got it back.

3515
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:06,480
Somehow.

3516
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:11,480
Literally the plot of my favourite anime, Maria and Nikki.

3517
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:16,480
Clipping is weird on YouTube, it is.

3518
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:29,480
I think they're going to improve the system, it would help so much with content creators on YouTube if they overhauled the clipping process the way they do it on Twitch.

3519
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:32,480
Twitch is so easy to clip, sorry about that.

3520
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:42,480
Oh my god.

3521
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:46,480
Does Amy not know?

3522
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:50,480
Somalia's pirate territory.

3523
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:55,480
Oh she does it, okay.

3524
02:17:55,480 --> 02:18:00,480
Somalia's literally known for piracy.

3525
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:02,480
Yes!

3526
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,480
Us.

3527
02:18:23,480 --> 02:18:27,480
Oh my god, Mercy's freaking going hard.

3528
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:34,480
These questions are, did they change to something else or did they just do the questions the whole stream?

3529
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:50,480
I see for one, they changed, okay.

3530
02:18:53,480 --> 02:18:58,480
They did Maros, okay Maros is fun, I like when you guys like say stuff to them.

3531
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:04,480
She's like a neural implant.

3532
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:17,480
Mercy should be called Mercy-less, honestly.

3533
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:23,480
Amy and Mercy are unten, Shibi's trying to lead the gang and Azur is too nice and sweet, real.

3534
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:38,480
It was so hard for me to pull off this collab by the way, I just thought you should know.

3535
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:45,480
Well I had to do all the voices at the same time and Adelaide and all that, it was quite awkward but I got there in the end.

3536
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:49,480
Teasing.

3537
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:52,480
Cheese, I'm all a bit lower, you didn't know?

3538
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:00,480
She's a talented VA, real.

3539
02:20:01,480 --> 02:20:09,480
But you're able to do it, yeah see, everyone thought it was Ubisoft's fault, it's because I couldn't have four computers connect to each other and play at the same time, clearly.

3540
02:20:09,480 --> 02:20:11,480
That literally just ends like me with my family, I can't even see them every year.

3541
02:20:40,480 --> 02:20:43,480
Azur is straight to the point, you know, true.

3542
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:59,480
Azur is ready, she's like, like, all I'm saying is when Azur moves out, life's good, I'm gonna be very happy, Bunny, when Azur moves out.

3543
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:03,480
Collaborate with Dad when?

3544
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:08,480
Unironically, Marilyn, soon, I'm not even kidding, thank you for this, super chat.

3545
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:22,480
My dad recorded a short of naming the YouTubers but I need to order assets for it because it's gonna be funnier if assets come along with it, so I need to do that.

3546
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:58,480
Soon, you pay with your soul, but, oh, oh no, do you want to know if I've written lore about Emmy, I think I've said it at the start.

3547
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:12,480
So, when the girls have had enough at Violaure, there's gonna be a released video of their happy ending, okay?

3548
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:18,480
And everyone's happy ending is related to their lore, okay?

3549
02:22:18,480 --> 02:22:27,480
So, Emmy finally achieves her forbidden love and she does get her brother back in the end.

3550
02:22:28,480 --> 02:22:47,480
But if and when the girls are like, okay, I'm satisfied with what I've done at Violaure, I don't want to do anymore, I will ask for one request which is please voice this ending sequence and we'll curtain call.

3551
02:22:47,480 --> 02:23:00,480
And they have the best, yes, please tell me you're not leaving, no, no, stop the, no, don't throw up, put it back in your mouth, swallow it, swallow it, don't throw up, it's okay, I'm not leaving.

3552
02:23:00,480 --> 02:23:13,480
Like, my lore, for example, my ending will be like, it's obviously gonna be the farm, let's be honest, that would be enough to make her grow, I think it's cute even though it's so sad.

3553
02:23:13,480 --> 02:23:33,480
Yes, I like the idea of a bittersweet thing of closing the story off, but obviously if a girl were to leave, they have an account and as I said, if and when a girl leaves Violaure on their account, the last tweet will be, my adventure here is over but my adventure continues on whatever social media account they're gonna continue on.

3554
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:41,480
As I said, we're not a fucking weird ass agent, say that's like, oh my god, you've never been a content creator, no, what the fuck, we still want them to succeed.

3555
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:51,480
It's kind of one of those, it's one of those scenes where it's like, I still want you to eat, just not at my table, because if you're, I threw up, stop.

3556
02:23:51,480 --> 02:24:09,480
It's Emmy's Final Four, Margaret Thatcher, it's technically, it's either the darkness in quotation marks or the devil is holding her brother back,

3557
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:29,480
but she's basically gonna become powerful enough over time to overthrow and, you know, make them a little, and basically get her brother back and they live together happily ever after and they do not have children, but they do the other stuff, which is fine.

3558
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:39,480
Because they're both consenting adults, the devil herself and it's fucking Margaret Thatcher, that's fine.

3559
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:48,480
All the wishy marks that used to be in my username are for each of the wishes I lost during the first three months of this year is ten a month.

3560
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:55,480
What's that, V-Reverie? That must be V-Reverie.

3561
02:24:55,480 --> 02:25:03,480
I nearly choked on an ice cube, it's so over, guys. Wait, why are you choking on an ice cube?

3562
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:07,480
The coffin catcher, Margaret Thatcher.

3563
02:25:07,480 --> 02:25:14,480
Wait, I'm getting sad. Stop getting sad, what, this, I'm talking about like, freaking five years in the future.

3564
02:25:14,480 --> 02:25:22,480
As I said, I'm probably gonna continue as strong as independent, like, once Veilers closed its wee doors and stuff.

3565
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:26,480
Don't take my ice cube.

3566
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:29,480
Thank you, Vulcan Dynasty.

3567
02:25:29,480 --> 02:25:31,480
Please don't choke on that ice cube.

3568
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:39,480
No, five years? No, I'm gonna continue as Strongzo. I like Strongzo, I like Strongzo, it's very neat.

3569
02:25:43,480 --> 02:25:46,480
Azur is literally like...

3570
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:52,480
Oh, Emi, Emi stopped aging once she got the book.

3571
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:57,480
Emi is a bit malnourished because she lived a wild life.

3572
02:25:57,480 --> 02:26:00,480
For anyone who wants to be a weirdo.

3573
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:02,480
No, they're adults.

3574
02:26:02,480 --> 02:26:05,480
Strongzo sounds like a clown name.

3575
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:07,480
It's the nickname of Strongzo, it's running.

3576
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:09,480
Can the girls buy the IP if they leave?

3577
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:13,480
Originally I thought it would be possible, but it's not.

3578
02:26:14,480 --> 02:26:20,480
Now, this wouldn't happen, but if in theory the IP was sold, it's recognized as Veilers.

3579
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:27,480
And then one of the girls went on a most schizophrenic rant of the most racist, vile stuff you could imagine.

3580
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:30,480
I can't have that because we still need the rights of the IP.

3581
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:41,480
And if we wanted to put out merch even without the talent present, for example, like, happily ever after type merch or story-wise or just something.

3582
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:45,480
And unfortunately, we, Veiler, need to retain the right to the IP.

3583
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:49,480
But the girls are aware of that, like, when they signed on the contract,

3584
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:53,480
they knew they were getting a whole new model handed to them and all of that.

3585
02:26:57,480 --> 02:27:01,480
YelfTuberPlan confirmed, I'm V-sucking on a bicycle.

3586
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:04,480
What? I'm V-sucking? Oh my god, we created a new verb.

3587
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:07,480
Can't tell the IP the same reason you didn't buy IP.

3588
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:15,480
No, I would never ask a V-tuber to hand me their IP. Absolutely, I would not do it.

3589
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:22,480
The brocomnomicom holds power beyond comprehension.

3590
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:27,480
I like that the detail that ICSF is based on materials from a crash plane.

3591
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:30,480
I fucking asked the concept artist about that and he was like,

3592
02:27:30,480 --> 02:27:40,480
I'm like, I mean, actually, because she could only scavenge what was around, you know.

3593
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:44,480
What's going on? We are watching the pinned VOD.

3594
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:49,480
There's a timestamp top left if you want to watch the VOD in the background and I'm yapping over it as always.

3595
02:27:49,480 --> 02:27:52,480
Happy accident in concept art? No, no, no, no.

3596
02:27:52,480 --> 02:28:01,480
So AC doesn't have access. AC lore-wise does not have access to civilization or anything like that.

3597
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:09,480
So the only clothes she could get was whatever she had at the time when she was found by her mother bear and her brother and sister bear

3598
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:12,480
and whatever was scavenged in the wildlife.

3599
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:20,480
Are they fighting?

3600
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:25,480
What are they doing?

3601
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:36,480
I love it.

3602
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:43,480
I can't burp on command. I can't do it.

3603
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:45,480
I can't do it.

3604
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:54,480
What? Can they all burp on command and I can?

3605
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:01,480
Oh my gosh.

3606
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:04,480
I'm jealous. They can all burp on command?

3607
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:08,480
What? How do you do that?

3608
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:14,480
I can't do it, bro.

3609
02:29:18,480 --> 02:29:21,480
Oh, teach me the secret.

3610
02:29:34,480 --> 02:29:39,480
Bro, I need to turn that into a short as well. What the heck? The stream's so good.

3611
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:42,480
You need to gulp air.

3612
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:52,480
I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to do it.

3613
02:29:58,480 --> 02:30:00,480
I don't know how to do it.

3614
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:02,480
How do you swallow air?

3615
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:04,480
Do you need to bite it?

3616
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:07,480
With your throat, then the burp goes up.

3617
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:11,480
Breathe in quick and deep.

3618
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:21,480
You know how mercy can't whistle? I can't burp on command. I don't understand what they're doing.

3619
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:25,480
You just swallow bubble air.

3620
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:28,480
I'm going to teach you during the convention.

3621
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:32,480
I'm going to teach you during the convention.

3622
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:38,480
Cappadi.

3623
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:44,480
I would say me. I'd actually say me.

3624
02:30:47,480 --> 02:30:49,480
Are you dumb?

3625
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:54,480
Oh, dumb! I thought she said dumb.

3626
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:56,480
Dumb. Not me, then.

3627
02:30:57,480 --> 02:30:59,480
She burps in French.

3628
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:02,480
She burps in French.

3629
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:10,480
Okay, I want mercy. I heard dumb.

3630
02:31:22,480 --> 02:31:24,480
I love mercy's laugh.

3631
02:31:25,480 --> 02:31:27,480
She be then stroney for dumb?

3632
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:32,480
She be.

3633
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:36,480
Lore-wise, yes.

3634
02:31:42,480 --> 02:31:45,480
Is that how you say keyfabe? I thought it was keyfab.

3635
02:31:54,480 --> 02:31:56,480
Keyfabe.

3636
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:06,480
I prefer to produce dumb content. I have a preference for it, like, definitely.

3637
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:23,480
What the fuck? This is so clippable.

3638
02:32:23,480 --> 02:32:26,480
Why have none of them submitted these clips to me?

3639
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:38,480
Please, Reflins, if you're doing this, please clip this on ShoeV's channel so I can get access to the clips.

3640
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:43,480
Oh my gosh.

3641
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:48,480
Everyone was too busy watching the clip one-handed, honestly.

3642
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:51,480
Just wait the rest of the streamers like this.

3643
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:02,480
Ah.

3644
02:33:10,480 --> 02:33:12,480
Crestroom is good. Just streams it.

3645
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:14,480
Maybe they felt it. It's spicy.

3646
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:16,480
Clippers, you're being signed.

3647
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:18,480
I'll pass it on.

3648
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:21,480
I hit her.

3649
02:33:21,480 --> 02:33:26,480
Fucking hell, she be burping me under the table. Hold on a minute here. I think I'm getting out-burped.

3650
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:36,480
Yeah, Mercy did do it. She cooked.

3651
02:33:47,480 --> 02:33:49,480
Is he getting in?

3652
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:54,480
Sleep. Slee in the Banking Edgeville, Denver.

3653
02:33:57,480 --> 02:33:59,480
Oh, me?

3654
02:34:01,480 --> 02:34:03,480
Wait, do you think I'm a degenerate?

3655
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:05,480
Yeah.

3656
02:34:24,480 --> 02:34:29,480
Denver, did I tell you my ace mould arrived?

3657
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:34,480
I was going to take a picture and tag you in it and be like, you're such a trend, sir, Denver.

3658
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:39,480
And then I was going to take a picture- I was going to take ShoeV and Emy's picture of it,

3659
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:42,480
and I was going to add you, Denver, and be like, look what you've done to it.

3660
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:44,480
Be a lure you've affected.

3661
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:50,480
You have had catastrophic effects on a V-Suber company, how dare you, Denver, how dare you.

3662
02:34:51,480 --> 02:34:55,480
You have a black mill bit. It makes me so bad.

3663
02:34:56,480 --> 02:35:00,480
Soju. I've never had soju. I dare you to do it.

3664
02:35:00,480 --> 02:35:05,480
Okay, okay, let me- let me cook after the stream. As I'm cooking these wines, let me cook and eat for a minute.

3665
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:11,480
The mould is, I think it's the exact same one that you've got, Denver.

3666
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:15,480
That thing- that thing was thang and that thing is big.

3667
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:20,480
It packs our meaty wallop. I've not put it in the mould and put it in the freezer yet,

3668
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:23,480
but that's happened, they're all fine.

3669
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:26,480
A giant ace is genuinely convenient, though.

3670
02:35:29,480 --> 02:35:33,480
Sestrone can never claim to be hot- ShoeV again, what the-

3671
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:39,480
That person- the person that made the entire company render face-

3672
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:42,480
This is almost a Jenshawkin.

3673
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:47,480
V-Suck is real, I knew it. How dare you, Vulcan dynasty. How dare you.

3674
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:53,480
What are we-

3675
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:07,480
We're-

3676
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:09,480
Oh.

3677
02:36:13,480 --> 02:36:14,480
What?!

3678
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:15,480
What?!

3679
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:20,480
What?!

3680
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:24,480
Where is this conversation going?!

3681
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:34,480
Oh my god, that makes so much sense why someone posted that meme about ShoeV.

3682
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:43,480
I have my head on- I have my hand on my head right now.

3683
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:51,480
I'm seriously using it to put in my Stanley and keep my drinks cool.

3684
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:54,480
Oh my god, I'm gobsmacked.

3685
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:58,480
There's an all-by-yourself handsome-

3686
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:01,480
Hey, let's go ShoeV, she knew it.

3687
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:03,480
Hey, she knew it.

3688
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:15,480
That accusation.

3689
02:37:19,480 --> 02:37:21,480
That's good.

3690
02:37:22,480 --> 02:37:25,480
Actually, speaking of hydration, Riflin hydrate for me darling.

3691
02:37:25,480 --> 02:37:28,480
It's been two and a half hours when you hydrate.

3692
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:34,480
Ugh.

3693
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:42,480
I love when ShoeV walked away from the lake.

3694
02:37:50,480 --> 02:37:52,480
Mm-hmm.

3695
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:54,480
Mm-hmm.

3696
02:37:59,480 --> 02:38:01,480
This is my first stream of all skirmishes.

3697
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:03,480
I have not played the game.

3698
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:06,480
Why are we trying to reach 99 in Cookin? Is it useful or is it a goal?

3699
02:38:06,480 --> 02:38:11,480
It's a goal of mine as a child to reach one skill 99

3700
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:14,480
and I picked Cookin purely based on the fact that I'm a woman.

3701
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:16,480
I said what I said.

3702
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:18,480
And we're just doing it now.

3703
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:20,480
We're an edge bill.

3704
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:25,480
And then we're watching a vaude in the background.

3705
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:32,480
Real.

3706
02:38:36,480 --> 02:38:38,480
I didn't...

3707
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:40,480
Ah!

3708
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:52,480
Oh my god.

3709
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:59,480
Here's Johnny, anytime stamp where you are on said vaude.

3710
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:03,480
I'm not in this vaude. I'm watching my gen mates.

3711
02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:06,480
Unless you mean this top left.

3712
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:13,480
I missed what she said.

3713
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:15,480
I missed what she said.

3714
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:17,480
I missed what she said.

3715
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:19,480
I missed what she said.

3716
02:39:20,480 --> 02:39:22,480
I missed what she said.

3717
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:24,480
Whoops.

3718
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,480
What?

3719
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:52,480
Ah.

3720
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:59,480
They were down bad this stream.

3721
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:01,480
Unironically.

3722
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:06,480
Time to make some cosplay.

3723
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:09,480
You guys show up to the convention and masks and stuff

3724
02:40:09,480 --> 02:40:15,480
and they'll be like literally flying over the panel desk to come see you.

3725
02:40:19,480 --> 02:40:21,480
What the fuck?

3726
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:26,480
Well, there's going to be a lot of pyramid head cosplays in the Veeler.

3727
02:40:26,480 --> 02:40:28,480
Real.

3728
02:40:28,480 --> 02:40:30,480
What the fuck?

3729
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:56,480
That makes me such a dick.

3730
02:40:58,480 --> 02:41:00,480
What the fuck?

3731
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:08,480
Oh my god.

3732
02:41:09,480 --> 02:41:11,480
She's feral.

3733
02:41:13,480 --> 02:41:15,480
Yeah.

3734
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:24,480
Put me in the water.

3735
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:26,480
Put me in the water.

3736
02:41:26,480 --> 02:41:28,480
I'll fuck them up.

3737
02:41:28,480 --> 02:41:30,480
Actually, I'm a really good swimmer.

3738
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:32,480
Just to flake that one.

3739
02:41:36,480 --> 02:41:38,480
I want to take up swimming again.

3740
02:41:38,480 --> 02:41:40,480
I should.

3741
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:42,480
It would be a healthy outlook for me.

3742
02:41:57,480 --> 02:42:00,480
They're already doing one.

3743
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:02,480
In August.

3744
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:09,480
Some of them who's already recorded it at that point.

3745
02:42:13,480 --> 02:42:15,480
That's a fucking nightmare.

3746
02:42:15,480 --> 02:42:17,480
But it'll be out soon.

3747
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:20,480
I hate swimming.

3748
02:42:20,480 --> 02:42:22,480
I'm not a water person.

3749
02:42:22,480 --> 02:42:24,480
I might go for a small nap.

3750
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:26,480
Rest well. Sleepy head.

3751
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:28,480
I'll still be on.

3752
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:30,480
I'm doing endurance.

3753
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:32,480
I'll still be on.

3754
02:42:32,480 --> 02:42:34,480
Rest well, those who need to sleep or do some stuff.

3755
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:36,480
A Scott thinks she'd win in the fight.

3756
02:42:36,480 --> 02:42:38,480
I'm shocked.

3757
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:40,480
A scrawny in a swimsuit.

3758
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:43,480
I wear the swimsuits that cover all of me up.

3759
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:46,480
It goes down my thighs and spoof.

3760
02:42:47,480 --> 02:42:49,480
I'll still be on.

3761
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:04,480
I think it passed, though.

3762
02:43:04,480 --> 02:43:06,480
I can't answer that.

3763
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:08,480
So that's a hard question.

3764
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:10,480
That's important.

3765
02:43:14,480 --> 02:43:16,480
Yeah!

3766
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:37,440
Amy! Oh my god. Mercy actually getting on her corruption arc. She's so embarrassed.

3767
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:44,440
That's adorable.

3768
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:49,440
Are you squidding me right now?

3769
02:43:49,440 --> 02:44:13,440
You fucking troll. Go enjoy your anniversary with your wife. I didn't know that fuckers the concept artist that we gave the secret thing to and it is their anniversary today with their wife

3770
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:19,440
What the fuck are you? Go spend the day with your fucking wife. That's an order.

3771
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:28,440
Don't fuck around on old school runescape. Fucking watch in the stream. Go hang out with your wife. It is a happy anniversary unironically though.

3772
02:44:28,440 --> 02:44:35,440
Here's to many more for you two together.

3773
02:44:35,440 --> 02:44:48,440
That's the real concept artist that's just donated for Veiler. It is truly the anniversary with him and his wife today.

3774
02:44:48,440 --> 02:45:03,440
Amy's just fucking donated. Don't watch this stream. Go plop each other or whatever it is people do on their anniversaries. Order takeout. Don't fucking think about work.

3775
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:10,440
You've been taking off the roster. Happy anniversary unironically though. Congrats. That's adorable.

3776
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:17,440
Go plop each other. I'm crying.

3777
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:24,440
That's the fucking concept artist for folks sake.

3778
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:29,440
What if they're fucking right now?

3779
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:38,440
Great for ASMR when? Do you want it?

3780
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:45,440
It's literally the concept artist that's made Gen 2 and Gen 1. Fuck.

3781
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:48,440
No, you're not winding me up for that.

3782
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:51,440
It's literally the concept artist.

3783
02:45:51,440 --> 02:45:55,440
I haven't seen so much in Strong though.

3784
02:45:55,440 --> 02:46:02,440
Rage bait. I'm actually falling for it though unironically.

3785
02:46:02,440 --> 02:46:10,440
Gen 2 leaks. We just do a little trolling.

3786
02:46:10,440 --> 02:46:15,440
Temp at 30.

3787
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:22,440
Mercy getting more corrupted each stream is a fun... look. I knew you guys wanted a corruption arc. I gave you it.

3788
02:46:22,440 --> 02:46:33,440
You wanted a don't-n-hack? I gave you a don't-n-hack. You wanted a corruption arc yandere? I gave you a corruption arc yandere.

3789
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:39,440
Shawnee makes me so H-word. Tempo.

3790
02:46:39,440 --> 02:46:53,440
I thought Teemo. Yeah, yeah, Teemo's that legal legend.

3791
02:46:53,440 --> 02:47:00,440
Wait, isn't Teemo the purple one that lives in a jungle or something?

3792
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:05,440
Debut reference. We lived...

3793
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:18,440
Teemo is a tiny... that's Lulu.

3794
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:24,440
Am I thinking of Beemo from Adventure Time?

3795
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:34,440
Teemo is a little piece of squirrel. Okay, I'm sensing a bit of hate against Teemo.

3796
02:47:34,440 --> 02:47:45,440
I'm afraid I don't know legal legends at all.

3797
02:47:45,440 --> 02:47:50,440
What's the Brazilian one that looks like a lizard from League of Legends?

3798
02:47:50,440 --> 02:48:02,440
She's a girl. She's got purple hair and she has a voice like this kind of.

3799
02:48:02,440 --> 02:48:09,440
I cast Brazil. Niko! Niko! Yeah, Niko. I like Niko.

3800
02:48:09,440 --> 02:48:16,440
Now, before anyone's like, you please... no, I haven't played it yet.

3801
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:21,440
Go now. Bye-bye. Thanks for hanging. That's not an hour in a day.

3802
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:25,440
Clearly we have a legal legend player here.

3803
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:33,440
Is there a way she stops breathing? It's so cute, Monkaeth.

3804
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:40,440
A voice going on in this board!

3805
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:46,440
Peter, the voice is here.

3806
02:48:46,440 --> 02:48:56,440
They don't know how to do Lois Griffin's voice?

3807
02:48:56,440 --> 02:49:04,440
Fuck, that was really good. What the fuck? The Scottish one can do the fucking impersonation better than like the American Canadians?

3808
02:49:05,440 --> 02:49:13,440
Chibi's lollipop voice is really... Oh, Lois's good voice.

3809
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:17,440
Big stretch!

3810
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:25,440
Okay.

3811
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:32,440
The space of life. You do it better than everyone?

3812
02:49:32,440 --> 02:49:36,440
I don't even know whether...

3813
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:44,440
Peter, look. Okay, fine. You win with your gay stuff.

3814
02:49:44,440 --> 02:49:51,440
I can't remember what other Lois quotes there are.

3815
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:54,440
My cat just went...

3816
02:49:54,440 --> 02:50:02,440
Actually, I'm not going to upset Gimli and Beagle if I do that.

3817
02:50:02,440 --> 02:50:06,440
Pina, the voice is here.

3818
02:50:07,440 --> 02:50:11,440
No, it's a quote! Lois Griffin goes like...

3819
02:50:11,440 --> 02:50:14,440
Fine, you win with your gay stuff.

3820
02:50:14,440 --> 02:50:31,440
It's a quote, it's a quote.

3821
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:45,440
There we are. That's an airhead.

3822
02:50:45,440 --> 02:50:51,440
Pina, we have a ham pot. Stop throwing your dirty clothes in the toilet.

3823
02:50:51,440 --> 02:51:09,440
I'm not kind of lost out there. American Laffy Taffy, okay.

3824
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:28,440
She went for a drink.

3825
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:33,440
What are you all talking about? Why didn't I join them when she was getting cute?

3826
02:51:33,440 --> 02:51:39,440
I fucking love that, I swear to you.

3827
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:43,440
Oh, she's a weird...

3828
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:50,440
Just cute, funny, though.

3829
02:51:50,440 --> 02:52:04,440
Saltwater Taffy, is it only except Saltwater Taffy?

3830
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:06,440
We need to keep it funny ASMR Club.

3831
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:11,440
What, all of us? I'll do that, don't think I want to arrange that.

3832
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:14,440
I'll unironically do it.

3833
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:16,440
How much will it cost to get the artwork?

3834
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:26,440
How much would it cost to get the artwork?

3835
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:28,440
I'll try to think.

3836
02:52:28,440 --> 02:52:30,440
How about I make you a deal?

3837
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:36,440
Next month, I will get that arranged.

3838
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:42,440
All six of us cute and funny ASMR Club deal.

3839
02:52:42,440 --> 02:52:44,440
What would the premise of the ASMR be?

3840
02:52:44,440 --> 02:52:51,440
That fucking thing that's really popular, it's like sleep next to a lollipop for eight hours.

3841
02:52:51,440 --> 02:52:56,440
Sleep next to six lollipops for 12 hours.

3842
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:59,440
And I'll get all of us drawn in the bed around you.

3843
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:05,440
I'll spend some fat stacks on that artwork to do it justice.

3844
02:53:05,440 --> 02:53:08,440
Deal? Okay.

3845
02:53:14,440 --> 02:53:16,440
Deal, but no requirement on our set.

3846
02:53:16,440 --> 02:53:20,440
Nah, you don't have to do anything. I'll just do it.

3847
02:53:20,440 --> 02:53:29,440
You guys don't have to do anything for that. It's fun.

3848
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:31,440
Let me take a more wedding.

3849
02:53:31,440 --> 02:53:33,440
I was just going to get my music.

3850
02:53:33,440 --> 02:53:35,440
Shut up and take my money.

3851
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:40,440
Oh, why not free for all oily mud wrestling days?

3852
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:44,440
Bro, how would we even try and make the folly sounds for that?

3853
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:50,440
It would basically just be all six of us grunting into the microphone, like Neanderthals.

3854
02:53:50,440 --> 02:53:58,440
And then oil sounds mixed in and skin and shuffling.

3855
02:53:59,440 --> 02:54:07,440
A little strongy better be cuddled up or latched onto our leg.

3856
02:54:07,440 --> 02:54:11,440
I'm going to have to get a really good artist for it.

3857
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:16,440
I don't want to waste my money if they ain't going to draw it Kawaii-nee, you know what I'm saying?

3858
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:26,440
Imagine Kawaii-nee, little Azura as well with her wee baby version of her horns and everything because they're not fully grown in yet.

3859
02:54:27,440 --> 02:54:29,440
So cute.

3860
02:54:29,440 --> 02:54:32,440
Was that the robot's death sound?

3861
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:38,440
Mail and stream just kidding, she was a deep boy.

3862
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:41,440
Neanderthal grunting is hitting the spot.

3863
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:47,440
Oily six bodies found unconscious in the head.

3864
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:50,440
Well, I don't know what we want. I've read that one.

3865
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:52,440
Does her hair glow in the dark?

3866
02:54:52,440 --> 02:54:56,440
It doesn't glow in the dark, but it does this.

3867
02:54:56,440 --> 02:55:00,440
When I want to do hypnosis, I'm a cult fish.

3868
02:55:00,440 --> 02:55:02,440
This is what my hair is.

3869
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:04,440
I don't glow in the dark.

3870
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:16,440
I'm kind of a gluttony as well. I fucking love food, sorry.

3871
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:22,440
How's Strony in it? Well listen, shimplash.

3872
02:55:22,440 --> 02:55:27,440
Six lollipops in a bed, sounds like some sort of FBI honeypot.

3873
02:55:27,440 --> 02:55:31,440
Call me Winnie the Pooh if it's a honeypot.

3874
02:55:31,440 --> 02:55:36,440
I'll make that ASMR and we'll all go on a list equally.

3875
02:55:36,440 --> 02:55:39,440
I'll get kicked out of Australia because you know.

3876
02:55:39,440 --> 02:55:43,440
And then it'll take me like a day to get to Scotland.

3877
02:55:43,440 --> 02:55:46,440
But in...

3878
02:55:46,440 --> 02:55:52,440
Sin said, if I'm ever in an emergency, she'd unironically let me go to her house.

3879
02:55:52,440 --> 02:55:56,440
So don't be surprised if I end up in Sin's house at some point.

3880
02:55:56,440 --> 02:55:59,440
Just take a seat right now.

3881
02:55:59,440 --> 02:56:12,440
Fetch me their souls.

3882
02:56:17,440 --> 02:56:20,440
Actually, I want to play Cod Zombies with you guys.

3883
02:56:20,440 --> 02:56:23,440
Can we get in Lobby's or Danny Addis' friend?

3884
02:56:23,440 --> 02:56:26,440
Strony streams from Melbourne Airport to not break her streams.

3885
02:56:26,440 --> 02:56:31,440
Real and true, real and true.

3886
02:56:31,440 --> 02:56:35,440
Fucking take a stop in London on the flight.

3887
02:56:35,440 --> 02:56:42,440
And like very quickly like fucking pop that shit up.

3888
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:47,440
She shouldn't. No one got V Bridger.

3889
02:56:56,440 --> 02:57:00,440
No, I didn't order it.

3890
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:05,440
It's probably leftover.

3891
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:08,440
Yeah, eventually.

3892
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:13,440
Eventually.

3893
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:15,440
I don't know, I've never played Cod before.

3894
02:57:15,440 --> 02:57:21,440
Cod also has Prop Hunt.

3895
02:57:21,440 --> 02:57:25,440
I wouldn't mind playing Prop Hunt with you guys.

3896
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:32,440
Shibu plays Gary's mod, Prop Hunt, and I want her to teach me.

3897
02:57:32,440 --> 02:57:51,440
Or like Trouble and Terrorist 10, I want to do that as well.

3898
02:57:51,440 --> 02:58:04,440
Oh my god.

3899
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:05,440
Prop Hunt would be amazing.

3900
02:58:05,440 --> 02:58:07,440
Trouble and Terrorist 10 would be good.

3901
02:58:07,440 --> 02:58:10,440
Black Ops 6 will have normal brown base zombies again.

3902
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:12,440
Wait, the other ones don't?

3903
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:16,440
Did they change up the formula?

3904
02:58:16,440 --> 02:58:21,440
The girls are so unhinged, honestly.

3905
02:58:21,440 --> 02:58:27,440
Oh, not this again.

3906
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:32,440
You're fucking ginger!

3907
02:58:32,440 --> 02:58:40,440
She's orange!

3908
02:58:40,440 --> 02:58:47,440
No, you're red at the end to compliment the accent colour in your design, Shibu!

3909
02:58:47,440 --> 02:58:54,440
Shibu's hair gets red at the end, but she's blonde.

3910
02:58:54,440 --> 02:58:57,440
No, not this debate again!

3911
02:58:57,440 --> 02:59:09,440
I can't escape it!

3912
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:19,440
I have to start throwing hands again.

3913
02:59:19,440 --> 02:59:25,440
Hit him with a pose!

3914
02:59:25,440 --> 02:59:27,440
I'm level 97, kicking!

3915
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:29,440
How are you ahead of me?!

3916
02:59:29,440 --> 02:59:32,440
You've been doing it off stream, how do you?

3917
02:59:32,440 --> 02:59:34,440
We looked at it, Emi's hair is mostly your memory.

3918
02:59:34,440 --> 02:59:40,440
Her concept art is a redhead, but the art is lightened or a bit...

3919
02:59:40,440 --> 02:59:42,440
Right.

3920
02:59:42,440 --> 02:59:46,440
As long as we agree concepted Emi is a ginger, okay?

3921
02:59:46,440 --> 02:59:49,440
And she's changed her hair to be more ginger anyway.

3922
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:51,440
But she is ginger, sorry, but she's not blonde.

3923
02:59:51,440 --> 02:59:59,440
I can literally see the orange hue in her hair, and what world is that blonde as ginger?

3924
03:00:00,440 --> 03:00:03,440
She brought it back, you should just fight people at this point.

3925
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:06,440
Honestly, the gloves are off at the convention.

3926
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:14,440
I'll have an extra little scene that says you think that Emi is blonde, and then I just straight up start fighting you.

3927
03:00:14,440 --> 03:00:24,440
I just chalk you out with my thighs as a result.

3928
03:00:24,440 --> 03:00:35,440
Emi's so cute, she can't do it.

3929
03:00:35,440 --> 03:00:37,440
Are you watching something?

3930
03:00:37,440 --> 03:00:43,440
Yes, it's linked in chat.

3931
03:00:43,440 --> 03:00:45,440
The timestamp is top left.

3932
03:00:45,440 --> 03:00:47,440
We're watching me gen mates.

3933
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:48,440
Shimpalash.

3934
03:00:48,440 --> 03:00:50,440
Oh no, please beat me up and choke me out.

3935
03:00:50,440 --> 03:00:52,440
Emi was blonde all along.

3936
03:00:52,440 --> 03:00:53,440
I dare you.

3937
03:00:53,440 --> 03:01:13,440
For your insolence, you will receive one choking out.

3938
03:01:13,440 --> 03:01:28,440
Oh.

3939
03:01:28,440 --> 03:01:40,440
Aww, that's pretty.

3940
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:45,440
Aww.

3941
03:01:45,440 --> 03:01:49,440
Honestly, gothify everyone.

3942
03:01:49,440 --> 03:01:51,440
Never ask a man his salary.

3943
03:01:51,440 --> 03:01:53,440
Never ask a woman her age.

3944
03:01:53,440 --> 03:01:56,440
Never ask a reflin on his opinion at 2001 Space Odyssey.

3945
03:01:56,440 --> 03:01:59,440
And never ask a story about Emi's hair color, true.

3946
03:01:59,440 --> 03:02:02,440
Golf company, honestly?

3947
03:02:02,440 --> 03:02:07,440
Very plausible.

3948
03:02:07,440 --> 03:02:09,440
Incredibly plausible.

3949
03:02:09,440 --> 03:02:15,440
For AC, she's like, legit adorable princess style.

3950
03:02:15,440 --> 03:02:20,440
Gothalur, Gialur.

3951
03:02:20,440 --> 03:02:24,440
I'd be sorry.

3952
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,440
Yeah, pastel goth phrase.

3953
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:51,440
What's the RK?

3954
03:02:51,440 --> 03:02:55,440
What's the RK?

3955
03:02:55,440 --> 03:03:00,440
If gender or Goths, then really if I'm going to lose the golf court.

3956
03:03:00,440 --> 03:03:11,440
Maybe I just attract them.

3957
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:15,440
Jirai Ke, it's an outfit style.

3958
03:03:15,440 --> 03:03:17,440
Oh, I'm learning.

3959
03:03:17,440 --> 03:03:21,440
It's like dark but still feminine.

3960
03:03:21,440 --> 03:03:37,440
Really educated.

3961
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:44,440
Aww.

3962
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:46,440
Do not wait for Gen 2.

3963
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:48,440
Gen 1 is already all Goths.

3964
03:03:48,440 --> 03:03:54,440
I'm starting to think we might be, AC might be the pastel exception.

3965
03:03:54,440 --> 03:03:56,440
Ezra's tracking so good.

3966
03:03:56,440 --> 03:04:16,440
Broad-narrated soil on us.

3967
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:23,440
Oh!

3968
03:04:23,440 --> 03:04:31,440
Damn, Emi, Emi needing that zoomer attention, the fuck.

3969
03:04:31,440 --> 03:04:34,440
Oh, right, she means H word.

3970
03:04:34,440 --> 03:04:39,440
Okay, that's different, she means H word.

3971
03:04:39,440 --> 03:04:42,440
Who is asking my daughter about her fucking...

3972
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:53,440
Shit and havers.

3973
03:04:53,440 --> 03:04:56,440
AC could be like the goth that is another phase.

3974
03:04:56,440 --> 03:04:58,440
Gotta get ready to go visit families.

3975
03:04:58,440 --> 03:05:00,440
Jani, love you, really be refilling.

3976
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:01,440
Everyone have a good night.

3977
03:05:01,440 --> 03:05:04,440
Enjoy visiting the fam.

3978
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:08,440
I'll probably be on by the time you're back.

3979
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:10,440
AC is a cyber goth.

3980
03:05:10,440 --> 03:05:22,440
Ooh.

3981
03:05:22,440 --> 03:05:30,440
Does it smell cute and funny?

3982
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:41,440
My brothers.

3983
03:05:41,440 --> 03:05:53,440
Wait, what was the content?

3984
03:05:53,440 --> 03:06:02,440
Oh, was it the puke one?

3985
03:06:02,440 --> 03:06:03,440
Veiler figure in a jar?

3986
03:06:03,440 --> 03:06:06,440
I don't know, I think Hulk gluen's pretty nice.

3987
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:19,440
I'm like crazy, I'm probably crazy for that but I think it's cool.

3988
03:06:20,440 --> 03:06:25,440
Ooh.

3989
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:28,440
She carved a name into her figure.

3990
03:06:28,440 --> 03:06:40,440
Oh, I never saw that.

3991
03:06:40,440 --> 03:06:48,440
Oh my god.

3992
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:53,440
The figure is just gone.

3993
03:06:53,440 --> 03:06:58,440
It's fucking gone.

3994
03:06:58,440 --> 03:07:08,440
I'm out, I'm out.

3995
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:18,440
Oh.

3996
03:07:18,440 --> 03:07:31,440
Okay, I think I know why Mercy took this then.

3997
03:07:31,440 --> 03:07:38,440
Ah.

3998
03:07:38,440 --> 03:07:48,440
The woman was too stunned to speak.

3999
03:07:48,440 --> 03:08:06,440
The woman was too stunned to speak, honestly.

4000
03:08:06,440 --> 03:08:20,440
Hey.

4001
03:08:20,440 --> 03:08:39,440
The mayor's the machine but she is crazy with what she planned for the girl coming to Wonderland.

4002
03:08:39,440 --> 03:09:05,440
Doesn't know this isn't even the worst part, yeah.

4003
03:09:05,440 --> 03:09:22,440
I like how they're all in tech support midstream, that's amazing.

4004
03:09:22,440 --> 03:09:29,440
It gets better.

4005
03:09:29,440 --> 03:09:48,440
Yeah, I'm inclined to Mercy.

4006
03:09:48,440 --> 03:09:50,440
Look, I like complimenting my daughters.

4007
03:09:50,440 --> 03:09:53,440
Shit, I'm guilty of fucking complimenting my daughters.

4008
03:09:53,440 --> 03:10:06,440
Shit, arrest me, arrest me if it's a crime.

4009
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:10,440
He just got called out, literally.

4010
03:10:10,440 --> 03:10:20,440
They made it against the law to compliment my daughters.

4011
03:10:20,440 --> 03:10:29,440
I'm gonna shock him.

4012
03:10:29,440 --> 03:10:38,440
Oh no.

4013
03:10:38,440 --> 03:10:41,440
I will get a fucking gore.

4014
03:10:41,440 --> 03:10:51,440
Look, look, I'm just, I like everyone.

4015
03:10:51,440 --> 03:10:57,440
I will arrest you on the charge of making all of us hatred on the team, caught in 4k.

4016
03:10:57,440 --> 03:11:02,440
Trying to get hit with right and left by the girl, sounds like you have things to confess.

4017
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:20,440
No.

4018
03:11:20,440 --> 03:11:26,440
Oh, she's gone, Azur is gone again.

4019
03:11:26,440 --> 03:11:34,440
Stop right there, you violated the law.

4020
03:11:34,440 --> 03:11:39,440
Scratch, scratch and strays left and right, you can just imagine what's going on in the discord.

4021
03:11:39,440 --> 03:11:44,440
Look, look.

4022
03:11:44,440 --> 03:11:57,440
As I said, everyone may or may not have been made a little in my image.

4023
03:11:57,440 --> 03:12:01,440
Azur not being in the frame, but yeah, literally.

4024
03:12:01,440 --> 03:12:05,440
What's she be said?

4025
03:12:05,440 --> 03:12:14,440
Shawnee after stream gonna be like, girls, I saw a certain stream.

4026
03:12:14,440 --> 03:12:20,440
Oh, we're almost in the tens of thousands instead of the 20th thousands.

4027
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:25,440
Azur's good boy, what little thing would you do at your gym mate?

4028
03:12:25,440 --> 03:12:30,440
You mean like if I had an ideal scenario with them?

4029
03:12:30,440 --> 03:12:37,440
I'm not even sure I'm allowed to see it out loud.

4030
03:12:37,440 --> 03:12:42,440
I'll tell you after the stream because I can't focus while they talk at the same time.

4031
03:12:42,440 --> 03:12:47,440
You guys will remind me of that question at the end of the stream because I like watching this VOD, sorry.

4032
03:12:47,440 --> 03:12:53,440
Because I can't focus and talk at the same time and listen at the same time, it's too much as an overload.

4033
03:12:53,440 --> 03:12:56,440
After the stream stream, we can't emergency meeting.

4034
03:12:56,440 --> 03:12:58,440
Don't you ever do that?

4035
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:17,440
Stun Lord.

4036
03:13:23,440 --> 03:13:28,440
She's not even able to look.

4037
03:13:53,440 --> 03:14:18,440
Okay, okay, okay, I see it.

4038
03:14:23,440 --> 03:14:39,440
Blindfold her gets a second eye patch.

4039
03:14:39,440 --> 03:14:58,440
Zero bat, mommy taking notes for future inspirations, y'all.

4040
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:01,440
Elf cob's gonna be something else.

4041
03:15:01,440 --> 03:15:04,440
The biohazard we'll create together.

4042
03:15:04,440 --> 03:15:15,440
Oh, no steps, sis, I'm stuck under the desk.

4043
03:15:15,440 --> 03:15:31,440
Ooh, romantic.

4044
03:15:31,440 --> 03:15:50,440
The base gremlin laugh.

4045
03:15:50,440 --> 03:16:02,440
Ugh.

4046
03:16:02,440 --> 03:16:11,440
No?

4047
03:16:11,440 --> 03:16:13,440
All the girls have wonderful love.

4048
03:16:13,440 --> 03:16:16,440
Mercy's just so unique in those enemies.

4049
03:16:16,440 --> 03:16:33,440
Hey, she's as good as well. Everyone's laughing, sis.

4050
03:16:33,440 --> 03:16:41,440
Oh my god.

4051
03:16:41,440 --> 03:16:53,440
Love tabs.

4052
03:16:53,440 --> 03:17:05,440
Monka is.

4053
03:17:05,440 --> 03:17:12,440
Oh my god.

4054
03:17:12,440 --> 03:17:28,440
We're gonna explicit detail.

4055
03:17:28,440 --> 03:17:35,440
Monka is.

4056
03:17:35,440 --> 03:17:43,440
Oh, shit.

4057
03:17:43,440 --> 03:18:02,440
Oh, shit, that was good.

4058
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:15,440
And then you know when Mercy deleted the mod from her own channel, she can't handle it.

4059
03:18:15,440 --> 03:18:18,440
That's so cute.

4060
03:18:18,440 --> 03:18:32,440
Oh, that's so cute, though.

4061
03:18:32,440 --> 03:18:40,440
You know, I'm not gonna lie, Azura actually eats a lot, talks a lot about eating Mercy.

4062
03:18:40,440 --> 03:18:58,440
And I'm starting to think she ain't joking no more because it's been mentioned quite a few times.

4063
03:18:58,440 --> 03:19:14,440
What the fuck? She's not even kidding.

4064
03:19:14,440 --> 03:19:25,440
She's not even kidding. You can tell when Azura is joking. She's not even kidding.

4065
03:19:25,440 --> 03:19:44,440
I need to write that freaking vor right away. What the fuck?

4066
03:19:44,440 --> 03:19:56,440
Azura got yellow fever? What? When did she divulge this information?

4067
03:19:56,440 --> 03:20:03,440
You thought the goddess of fertility was just in there?

4068
03:20:03,440 --> 03:20:22,440
Wait two more times, it's not a joke anymore.

4069
03:20:22,440 --> 03:20:46,440
Oh my god, no Emmys drilling, I've just noticed her drillers.

4070
03:20:46,440 --> 03:20:59,440
Oh, she missed the walk away?

4071
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:07,440
She had to walk away, that's hilarious.

4072
03:21:07,440 --> 03:21:28,440
She's sweating now. It's super effective, Pokemon style.

4073
03:21:28,440 --> 03:21:43,440
No, no, no, no, no, it's part of the aesthetics.

4074
03:21:43,440 --> 03:21:52,440
Okay, they peeled it back.

4075
03:21:52,440 --> 03:21:57,440
If you censor it and get around it girls, you can do it.

4076
03:21:57,440 --> 03:22:14,440
Aesthetic! Everyone has taken psychic damage.

4077
03:22:14,440 --> 03:22:30,440
Azura's supremacy.

4078
03:22:30,440 --> 03:22:41,440
They totally peeled it back.

4079
03:22:41,440 --> 03:22:51,440
Wait, does she?

4080
03:22:51,440 --> 03:23:06,440
No, I lost mine. I lost mine in the Great War. I lost mine in the Great War of Transport.

4081
03:23:06,440 --> 03:23:17,440
I need to order, I want to order new ones. I lost tons in the Great War.

4082
03:23:17,440 --> 03:23:27,440
No, I think it's Emmy, sorry, I think it's Emmy. I want to say it's Emmy.

4083
03:23:27,440 --> 03:23:41,440
So many have been sacrificed, literally.

4084
03:23:42,440 --> 03:24:01,440
Thank you, thank you, I'll be here all day.

4085
03:24:01,440 --> 03:24:10,440
There's one thing Azura, she's the goddess of fertility, not fertility, goddess.

4086
03:24:10,440 --> 03:24:14,440
And there's a difference between them, and she says fertility goddess.

4087
03:24:14,440 --> 03:24:22,440
And I'm always trying to gentle pair it and be goddess of fertility, but I'm just letting her have it.

4088
03:24:22,440 --> 03:24:36,440
But she's the goddess of fertility, not fertility goddess. Does that make sense?

4089
03:24:36,440 --> 03:24:42,440
What's the difference? So a fertility goddess could be anything.

4090
03:24:42,440 --> 03:24:59,440
You could have implies there can be multiple of this vocation, whereas the goddess of fertility, there is only one true goddess of fertility, which is Azura.

4091
03:25:00,440 --> 03:25:10,440
That makes sense. And lore-wise Azura is everyone's mum, which is the difference.

4092
03:25:10,440 --> 03:25:15,440
And there is only one Azura, you know?

4093
03:25:15,440 --> 03:25:18,440
Fertility goddess of fertility implies people.

4094
03:25:18,440 --> 03:25:22,440
No, she's the goddess of fertility. You've got it the other way around.

4095
03:25:22,440 --> 03:25:26,440
Wait, that's not the exact opposite. No, you've done it the other way around.

4096
03:25:27,440 --> 03:25:32,440
Oh, that's the fertility goddess. Oh, they're also a fertility goddess.

4097
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:38,440
But that's Azura, the goddess of fertility. Hold up, let her cook.

4098
03:25:57,440 --> 03:26:00,440
Oh.

4099
03:26:04,440 --> 03:26:07,440
Goddess of fertility of fertility, got it.

4100
03:26:10,440 --> 03:26:14,440
No, no, that's not how it works.

4101
03:26:14,440 --> 03:26:19,440
Are you still planning on watching Genmate's Vods?

4102
03:26:19,440 --> 03:26:26,440
I have absolutely terrible news for you. We're watching one right now. All the information's at the top of the stream.

4103
03:26:26,440 --> 03:26:32,440
The timestamp, what we're watching, and it's LinkedIn Gen Chat, like in the general chat.

4104
03:26:49,440 --> 03:26:56,440
Oh, she's not telling us.

4105
03:27:09,440 --> 03:27:14,440
How bad was the costume, god damn!

4106
03:27:14,440 --> 03:27:21,440
A bit too supportive of her. Will you be streaming to others? I'm going to try to, whether or not we get there.

4107
03:27:21,440 --> 03:27:26,440
I unfortunately have been taking a lot of HP damage behind the scenes recently.

4108
03:27:34,440 --> 03:27:40,440
What was she? I don't know, I don't remember her posting anything.

4109
03:27:40,440 --> 03:27:45,440
We tried to get her to tell us she still wouldn't do it.

4110
03:27:54,440 --> 03:27:59,440
Have any of you broken the law?

4111
03:27:59,440 --> 03:28:06,440
Oh, G-Walking's real, I forgot about that. Public indecency.

4112
03:28:06,440 --> 03:28:11,440
Yeah, it was me.

4113
03:28:16,440 --> 03:28:21,440
She did it, please tell me she didn't.

4114
03:28:28,440 --> 03:28:33,440
I saw a watch when I was 5 or something. Confession stream starts now.

4115
03:28:34,440 --> 03:28:40,440
Do you have any marks on your leg lift? I don't know, they all went. No, they're all gone.

4116
03:28:40,440 --> 03:28:45,440
It looked like it had a weird version of chickenpox.

4117
03:28:45,440 --> 03:28:50,440
I don't know.

4118
03:29:01,440 --> 03:29:06,440
G-Walking? Yeah, no bruising.

4119
03:29:06,440 --> 03:29:11,440
Her M-E-M-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E-D-E recently.

4120
03:29:16,440 --> 03:29:21,440
Noted, E-M-E. Noted.

4121
03:29:25,440 --> 03:29:30,440
Noted. I have a very unique plot for E-M-E, actually.

4122
03:29:30,440 --> 03:29:39,440
She's the daughter of a mafia boss and she needs to break you, basically, to do the bidding of the family, so...

4123
03:29:40,440 --> 03:29:45,440
I'm gonna see what I can do, but she basically degrades you, and it's with her feet.

4124
03:29:45,440 --> 03:29:50,440
I don't know if I made her do a foot recently, but I really like the concept and the premise.

4125
03:29:50,440 --> 03:29:54,440
I'm gonna try and develop it further.

4126
03:29:54,440 --> 03:30:01,440
Is that a banger plot? Yeah, you like it? Have you committed a crime? Public indecency, probably.

4127
03:30:03,440 --> 03:30:08,440
Al Capone mentioned, mafia boss daughter or peer? Weirdly common.

4128
03:30:08,440 --> 03:30:12,440
Good one. Are the ASMRs cannot? No.

4129
03:30:12,440 --> 03:30:20,440
It is not possible for the girls to produce audios in the same lower...

4130
03:30:20,440 --> 03:30:26,440
It limits them severely. I would never do that. I would never do that.

4131
03:30:26,440 --> 03:30:31,440
What's your favourite audio? My? Of me?

4132
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:40,440
I actually like the Reefling Honey Tea one, because we wrote it together and it felt so much more special than what I'm guessing.

4133
03:30:40,440 --> 03:30:50,440
It felt really nice. We wrote it together and then produced it. It was really nice. I liked that. It was very nice.

4134
03:30:50,440 --> 03:30:55,440
Surely made an offer they can't refuse.

4135
03:30:55,440 --> 03:31:00,440
So you come to me on the day of my daughter's... something.

4136
03:31:00,440 --> 03:31:05,440
Ooh, did that pop?

4137
03:31:05,440 --> 03:31:10,440
Finish a race on a day? Is this what they're asking?

4138
03:31:10,440 --> 03:31:15,440
No, she beats fucking background music coming out of nowhere.

4139
03:31:21,440 --> 03:31:25,440
It means like four or something.

4140
03:31:25,440 --> 03:31:29,440
Yeah, literally, you got me, Stevie.

4141
03:31:29,440 --> 03:31:33,440
Wait, can they have multiple?

4142
03:31:35,440 --> 03:31:39,440
Can they have multiple?

4143
03:31:39,440 --> 03:31:44,440
I don't have that ability.

4144
03:31:44,440 --> 03:31:49,440
I don't have that ability.

4145
03:31:49,440 --> 03:31:54,440
On the day of my daughter's wedding.

4146
03:31:54,440 --> 03:31:59,440
Just straight up a gunin' session. What the fuck is this?

4147
03:32:13,440 --> 03:32:18,440
How do you even get in dolphins after like the third batch? I don't know.

4148
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:23,440
Wanna find out if you can?

4149
03:32:23,440 --> 03:32:28,440
Okay, that was smooth. I'll give you that reform. That was smooth.

4150
03:32:28,440 --> 03:32:33,440
Don't make me boot up Supermarket Simulator, okay?

4151
03:32:33,440 --> 03:32:38,440
That stream got limited ads, because of how much I was talking about Inca news in the back.

4152
03:32:48,440 --> 03:32:52,440
I don't have that ability. What the fuck? I need like a hot patch or something.

4153
03:32:52,440 --> 03:32:56,440
Put me in. Developers, what the fuck?

4154
03:32:56,440 --> 03:33:00,440
One, when you put the G-spot in my fucking ass, which makes no sense.

4155
03:33:00,440 --> 03:33:07,440
Two, you deny me the multiple fucking collateral that everyone else gets. What the fuck?

4156
03:33:18,440 --> 03:33:23,440
What?

4157
03:33:23,440 --> 03:33:28,440
What?

4158
03:33:28,440 --> 03:33:33,440
What? Two minutes?

4159
03:33:48,440 --> 03:33:53,440
Hello, hi.

4160
03:33:53,440 --> 03:33:58,440
I'm one and done in like maybe seven seconds.

4161
03:33:58,440 --> 03:34:04,440
If I'm, you know, if it's a lucky day, maybe, you know, a whole ten seconds of joy.

4162
03:34:04,440 --> 03:34:09,440
Like shit.

4163
03:34:09,440 --> 03:34:14,440
Uh...

4164
03:34:15,440 --> 03:34:20,440
She's mercy cheesin'.

4165
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:38,440
Real.

4166
03:34:38,440 --> 03:34:43,440
We're reaching the fireworks. Is there a freak?

4167
03:34:43,440 --> 03:34:47,440
Do I need a reflux and play with her?

4168
03:34:47,440 --> 03:34:51,440
Like a player like a violin and sure about a body can really do it?

4169
03:34:51,440 --> 03:34:56,440
MonkaS? Is that a threat or a problem?

4170
03:34:56,440 --> 03:35:00,440
We're approaching 95. We absolutely are.

4171
03:35:00,440 --> 03:35:05,440
We're at 141 for remaining.

4172
03:35:06,440 --> 03:35:11,440
Honestly, real and true.

4173
03:35:16,440 --> 03:35:21,440
I'm sorry, but if I had one reflux, it'd be over. You'd be my first target.

4174
03:35:21,440 --> 03:35:25,440
I'd be honing in.

4175
03:35:25,440 --> 03:35:29,440
I'd be honing in on your address.

4176
03:35:29,440 --> 03:35:32,440
Stacking donuts is so real, though.

4177
03:35:32,440 --> 03:35:37,440
That should be my sequel. Please let me stack donuts on it, please.

4178
03:35:37,440 --> 03:35:40,440
Right, I'm going to write the sequel to the please let me hold it.

4179
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:42,440
It's please let me stack donuts on it.

4180
03:35:42,440 --> 03:35:44,440
Next, let me write that down on a piece of paper.

4181
03:35:44,440 --> 03:35:48,440
Write that down, write that down.

4182
03:35:51,440 --> 03:35:53,440
Hold on.

4183
03:35:53,440 --> 03:36:00,440
Please let me stack donuts on it.

4184
03:36:00,440 --> 03:36:03,440
On it.

4185
03:36:12,440 --> 03:36:16,440
Post donut clarity, real!

4186
03:36:16,440 --> 03:36:19,440
You can stack your donuts on it.

4187
03:36:19,440 --> 03:36:25,440
Yes, mummy, this'll win. Right now, bend over, darling.

4188
03:36:25,440 --> 03:36:29,440
Text? How much can you feel with it?

4189
03:36:30,440 --> 03:36:37,440
No, no, that's not real. I think that's a meme.

4190
03:36:37,440 --> 03:36:43,440
I think that was a prank that guys put together, okay?

4191
03:36:47,440 --> 03:36:53,440
Yeah, I think that was a meme that guys put together to confuse women.

4192
03:36:54,440 --> 03:36:59,440
No, don't do that.

4193
03:36:59,440 --> 03:37:03,440
No, reflins, don't do that either.

4194
03:37:07,440 --> 03:37:11,440
I have not dipped my nuts in soy sauce to confirm.

4195
03:37:11,440 --> 03:37:14,440
Reflin, no!

4196
03:37:14,440 --> 03:37:18,440
Reflin, did you actually test it out after reading it?

4197
03:37:24,440 --> 03:37:28,440
What?

4198
03:37:28,440 --> 03:37:34,440
Girlfriend begs you to dip in soy sauce to see if you can taste it.

4199
03:37:34,440 --> 03:37:36,440
Really sure.

4200
03:37:39,440 --> 03:37:42,440
I'll make me like a Twitter one.

4201
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:48,440
My ex.

4202
03:37:48,440 --> 03:37:53,440
This actually happened on Sheeby's Twitter? What?

4203
03:37:53,440 --> 03:37:58,440
No, I mean, that just sounds inconvenient.

4204
03:37:58,440 --> 03:38:01,440
I know someone who did alcohol with his moh.

4205
03:38:01,440 --> 03:38:07,440
It makes you like, how dare you, RuneScape, you've been playing for a while, consider taking a break from your screen.

4206
03:38:07,440 --> 03:38:10,440
How dare you care for my health and well-being.

4207
03:38:10,440 --> 03:38:17,440
I'm gonna go pee, I'll pee and we'll get a break after the vodka's finished and we'll get up and stretch and pee and I'll get food as well.

4208
03:38:17,440 --> 03:38:19,440
Okay.

4209
03:38:41,440 --> 03:38:44,440
What's the question?

4210
03:38:48,440 --> 03:38:51,440
Four!

4211
03:39:05,440 --> 03:39:07,440
No, the vodka's ending.

4212
03:39:07,440 --> 03:39:09,440
What's the tape?

4213
03:39:10,440 --> 03:39:13,440
Is that not anything?

4214
03:39:13,440 --> 03:39:16,440
It's not a freak, but in a good way.

4215
03:39:16,440 --> 03:39:20,440
Well, do you just seem to have been looking at the screen the whole time?

4216
03:39:20,440 --> 03:39:24,440
Soy sauce is the beginner level. We're trying hot sauce.

4217
03:39:26,440 --> 03:39:28,440
Oh, God.

4218
03:39:28,440 --> 03:39:38,440
Oh, bless her.

4219
03:39:38,440 --> 03:39:41,440
Bless her.

4220
03:39:49,440 --> 03:39:52,440
Cut his or his face.

4221
03:39:58,440 --> 03:40:01,440
But but, three holes, four toys.

4222
03:40:01,440 --> 03:40:04,440
One wouldn't be put on the peril.

4223
03:40:13,440 --> 03:40:17,440
Hot sauce on the torture zone was an Aztec method.

4224
03:40:17,440 --> 03:40:19,440
I'm sorry.

4225
03:40:26,440 --> 03:40:29,440
Lurking them shadows.

4226
03:40:42,440 --> 03:40:44,440
Badimts.

4227
03:40:48,440 --> 03:40:53,440
I literally, Kohai, never seen you so quiet before.

4228
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:55,440
Our little yapper.

4229
03:40:57,440 --> 03:40:59,440
She's scared.

4230
03:40:59,440 --> 03:41:02,440
Veil or meet-up cancelled after this stream.

4231
03:41:02,440 --> 03:41:04,440
I wish it.

4232
03:41:08,440 --> 03:41:11,440
Aw, that'd be adorable.

4233
03:41:18,440 --> 03:41:21,440
Mercy's sort of classed here.

4234
03:41:33,440 --> 03:41:35,440
Oh, yeah, basically.

4235
03:41:35,440 --> 03:41:38,440
Yeah, we love AC, please.

4236
03:41:39,440 --> 03:41:41,440
Is that me?

4237
03:41:41,440 --> 03:41:44,440
Or is that AC?

4238
03:41:46,440 --> 03:41:48,440
No.

4239
03:41:59,440 --> 03:42:01,440
That was where AC.

4240
03:42:01,440 --> 03:42:03,440
Oh, okay, right.

4241
03:42:03,440 --> 03:42:06,440
I was like, okay.

4242
03:42:07,440 --> 03:42:09,440
Hello, replaying.

4243
03:42:09,440 --> 03:42:12,440
We AC's weave is so good.

4244
03:42:15,440 --> 03:42:18,440
Oh, I hear it now, I hear it now.

4245
03:42:25,440 --> 03:42:28,440
It's cute, it's adorable.

4246
03:42:29,440 --> 03:42:31,440
So cute.

4247
03:42:42,440 --> 03:42:44,440
AC innocent, that woman wants us nowhere,

4248
03:42:44,440 --> 03:42:47,440
so we're on a train on it, real.

4249
03:42:50,440 --> 03:42:52,440
Oh, it's already got monetized.

4250
03:42:52,440 --> 03:42:55,440
God, that's such a nightmare.

4251
03:42:59,440 --> 03:43:01,440
Yep.

4252
03:43:01,440 --> 03:43:04,440
Azura was last, but not least.

4253
03:43:07,440 --> 03:43:10,440
YouTube made her jump through hoops.

4254
03:43:14,440 --> 03:43:17,440
Eh, close enough, close enough, yeah, it's fine.

4255
03:43:23,440 --> 03:43:25,440
Girls.

4256
03:43:29,440 --> 03:43:32,440
This is how...

4257
03:43:34,440 --> 03:43:37,440
they are, actually.

4258
03:43:49,440 --> 03:43:52,440
Oh, Amy must have been on the other side.

4259
03:43:53,440 --> 03:43:56,440
Oh, my tummy's getting sore,

4260
03:43:56,440 --> 03:43:59,440
because I'm hungry.

4261
03:44:07,440 --> 03:44:10,440
Hawaii.

4262
03:44:10,440 --> 03:44:13,440
Eat, Momay, I'll eat when I get up.

4263
03:44:13,440 --> 03:44:17,440
I'll finish this board, and then we'll eat.

4264
03:44:23,440 --> 03:44:25,440
What's the name?

4265
03:44:25,440 --> 03:44:28,440
Oh, Shiver.

4266
03:44:33,440 --> 03:44:36,440
I'm with the science team.

4267
03:44:53,440 --> 03:44:55,440
Ah.

4268
03:45:12,440 --> 03:45:15,440
Holy shit, I can't handle vibration.

4269
03:45:15,440 --> 03:45:18,440
I can't handle vibration.

4270
03:45:18,440 --> 03:45:21,440
Too much.

4271
03:45:24,440 --> 03:45:27,440
Oh, they all, oh my, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4272
03:45:27,440 --> 03:45:30,440
I think I'm broken, I think I'm secretly a guy

4273
03:45:30,440 --> 03:45:33,440
somehow or something, because, yeah.

4274
03:45:33,440 --> 03:45:36,440
Because, literally, it's too much, it's far too much.

4275
03:45:36,440 --> 03:45:39,440
Eh, what board are we watching next?

4276
03:45:39,440 --> 03:45:42,440
We will find out, we're going to take a break,

4277
03:45:42,440 --> 03:45:44,440
I'm going to get some food, I'm going to make a cup of tea,

4278
03:45:44,440 --> 03:45:46,440
I'm going to go for a pee, because my bladder's full,

4279
03:45:46,440 --> 03:45:48,440
my stomach's empty.

4280
03:45:48,440 --> 03:45:51,440
And then we will pick the next board to watch.

4281
03:45:55,440 --> 03:45:57,440
I don't know what kind of ones you guys recommend.

4282
03:45:57,440 --> 03:46:00,440
I think, I really don't know what kind of ones

4283
03:46:00,440 --> 03:46:02,440
you guys recommend.

4284
03:46:02,440 --> 03:46:05,440
I don't know what kind of ones you guys recommend.

4285
03:46:05,440 --> 03:46:08,440
I think, I really want to watch Emmy's Handcam stream

4286
03:46:08,440 --> 03:46:11,440
with Esteban and all of that, where the rats were out,

4287
03:46:11,440 --> 03:46:14,440
because that was really cute, I think that was really cute.

4288
03:46:14,440 --> 03:46:17,440
And I really want to see it.

4289
03:46:18,440 --> 03:46:21,440
Oh, for fuck's sake, I never wrote the name.

4290
03:46:21,440 --> 03:46:31,440
My favorite Emmy, Lily Poff.

4291
03:46:34,440 --> 03:46:37,440
Oh, Maryse told the truth, she did need to go on.

4292
03:46:37,440 --> 03:46:39,440
The rats stole everything?

4293
03:46:39,440 --> 03:46:42,440
Yeah, I think the kick and stream of the rats is adorable.

4294
03:46:46,440 --> 03:46:50,440
Yeah, Emmy's shit, yeah, kind of kicked on Emmy's,

4295
03:46:50,440 --> 03:46:53,440
Mama, you're going to get some food.

4296
03:46:53,440 --> 03:46:56,440
Yeah, I'm going to get some food, because I'm starving.

4297
03:47:01,440 --> 03:47:04,440
That looks like she's vaping, like randomly.

4298
03:47:05,440 --> 03:47:08,440
Okay, that was funny.

4299
03:47:17,440 --> 03:47:20,440
Oh, Maryse is so shy, she's so adorable.

4300
03:47:20,440 --> 03:47:22,440
Anime Astrome, right?

4301
03:47:22,440 --> 03:47:25,440
She was strong, she was going to tell us what she was going to do at Gemma's.

4302
03:47:25,440 --> 03:47:27,440
Oh, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay, yay.

4303
03:47:27,440 --> 03:47:29,440
Can I get food first though?

4304
03:47:29,440 --> 03:47:31,440
I'm starving, I'm so exquisiting.

4305
03:47:34,440 --> 03:47:36,440
Oh, Maryse.

4306
03:47:44,440 --> 03:47:48,440
We just need to make her more comfortable with being a degenerate on main.

4307
03:47:48,440 --> 03:47:50,440
Rats.

4308
03:48:02,440 --> 03:48:04,440
Oh, Azura's gone, she's had enough.

4309
03:48:04,440 --> 03:48:06,440
Maryse.

4310
03:48:18,440 --> 03:48:20,440
Maryse must be dreading the awful album.

4311
03:48:20,440 --> 03:48:22,440
No, no.

4312
03:48:22,440 --> 03:48:25,440
Thanks for coming to the, she should have stopped it.

4313
03:48:25,440 --> 03:48:27,440
Thanks for coming.

4314
03:48:27,440 --> 03:48:29,440
What's really real?

4315
03:48:29,440 --> 03:48:31,440
Real.

4316
03:48:35,440 --> 03:48:40,440
I have told her, her discord make does not like her, and she can't go through her pit.

4317
03:48:40,440 --> 03:48:42,440
And she's like, you know what's wrong, eh?

4318
03:48:42,440 --> 03:48:44,440
And I'm like, yes, Azura.

4319
03:48:52,440 --> 03:48:54,440
Burpee.

4320
03:48:56,440 --> 03:48:58,440
Maryse in the off collab.

4321
03:48:58,440 --> 03:49:00,440
I'm in danger, honestly.

4322
03:49:00,440 --> 03:49:05,440
Oh my God, I wish I had time to edit and draw this, like my version.

4323
03:49:05,440 --> 03:49:09,440
You know the anime girl that's hiding under the desk?

4324
03:49:09,440 --> 03:49:14,440
Put Maryse there, and the rest of us are like, oh, Maryse.

4325
03:49:14,440 --> 03:49:18,440
And it's like POV violers first off collab, and we're like coming after her.

4326
03:49:25,440 --> 03:49:27,440
The one we're tearing it.

4327
03:49:27,440 --> 03:49:29,440
I don't know, there's like an anime girl under a desk.

4328
03:49:29,440 --> 03:49:36,440
I got it edited with a death claw when we played Fallout.

4329
03:49:36,440 --> 03:49:40,440
Because the fucking thing chased me in our bloody hoose.

4330
03:49:54,440 --> 03:49:57,440
Is she pulling Emmy up? She is.

4331
03:49:59,440 --> 03:50:01,440
She is.

4332
03:50:10,440 --> 03:50:13,440
Emmy's grippers for free, real.

4333
03:50:13,440 --> 03:50:16,440
If in the future you want to watch more of us, feel free to do it.

4334
03:50:16,440 --> 03:50:19,440
This is fantastic. You've not already watched it, your reactions are cute.

4335
03:50:22,440 --> 03:50:26,440
Oh my God, you can't say that.

4336
03:50:27,440 --> 03:50:30,440
Even if it's true.

4337
03:50:36,440 --> 03:50:39,440
It's too much for Maryse, but the rest is okay.

4338
03:50:44,440 --> 03:50:47,440
Oh, she doesn't want to get a warning.

4339
03:50:51,440 --> 03:50:55,440
Maryse wants to be a well-behaved yandere.

4340
03:50:57,440 --> 03:50:59,440
Aww.

4341
03:51:00,440 --> 03:51:03,440
Aww, baby.

4342
03:51:08,440 --> 03:51:11,440
Aww, she's so cute.

4343
03:51:12,440 --> 03:51:14,440
She's so cute.

4344
03:51:21,440 --> 03:51:25,440
Aww, she's so cute, Maryse.

4345
03:51:27,440 --> 03:51:30,440
Aww, bless their cotton book.

4346
03:51:32,440 --> 03:51:35,440
That's actually the reason.

4347
03:51:51,440 --> 03:51:54,440
Aww, yeah.

4348
03:51:55,440 --> 03:51:58,440
We'll turn her into one of us soon enough.

4349
03:51:59,440 --> 03:52:02,440
Oh, about 77,000 until the next level.

4350
03:52:02,440 --> 03:52:05,440
I'm not sure how many wings that is.

4351
03:52:14,440 --> 03:52:16,440
Yubi's shit.

4352
03:52:17,440 --> 03:52:20,440
Aww, that's adorable.

4353
03:52:21,440 --> 03:52:25,440
They're on the same brain wave length.

4354
03:52:32,440 --> 03:52:35,440
Yeah, they should refund this.

4355
03:52:35,440 --> 03:52:37,440
Yeah, I know that.

4356
03:52:37,440 --> 03:52:40,440
Sorry, I'm playing with that squishy bowl if you can hear me.

4357
03:52:40,440 --> 03:52:43,440
Maryse, something in the background, just in case.

4358
03:52:51,440 --> 03:52:53,440
Heh.

4359
03:52:56,440 --> 03:52:59,440
I love the tech support live on stream.

4360
03:52:59,440 --> 03:53:01,440
I'm adoring this.

4361
03:53:01,440 --> 03:53:04,440
Live tech support on getting a refund.

4362
03:53:12,440 --> 03:53:15,440
It came with your eggs, fuck.

4363
03:53:21,440 --> 03:53:24,440
Oh my god, this is precious.

4364
03:53:24,440 --> 03:53:26,440
What an air.

4365
03:53:30,440 --> 03:53:33,440
No way, they're doing live tech support

4366
03:53:33,440 --> 03:53:36,440
so if you can get a refund, that is adorable.

4367
03:53:40,440 --> 03:53:42,440
Oh, she's talking through it.

4368
03:53:42,440 --> 03:53:45,440
Oh my god, this is precious.

4369
03:53:46,440 --> 03:53:49,440
My tech illiterate little sister.

4370
03:53:51,440 --> 03:53:54,440
She was like, she didn't care what V-Sync was the other day

4371
03:53:54,440 --> 03:53:57,440
when she was playing Poppy Playtime and I'm like,

4372
03:53:57,440 --> 03:53:59,440
darling?

4373
03:54:00,440 --> 03:54:02,440
Real? True?

4374
03:54:02,440 --> 03:54:04,440
Sweetheart.

4375
03:54:04,440 --> 03:54:07,440
She doesn't know what resolution monitor was.

4376
03:54:18,440 --> 03:54:20,440
Adorable!

4377
03:54:29,440 --> 03:54:32,440
Aw, they all redirected an Ezreal, that's nice.

4378
03:54:32,440 --> 03:54:34,440
I like that.

4379
03:54:36,440 --> 03:54:38,440
Drumroll.

4380
03:54:40,440 --> 03:54:43,440
Wholesome allegations, upheld.

4381
03:54:45,440 --> 03:54:48,440
Technologically illiterate V to this.

4382
03:54:51,440 --> 03:54:54,440
Actually, I want to watch Azur's membership celebration as well.

4383
03:54:54,440 --> 03:54:57,440
We'll watch Amy's rights, Azur's membership,

4384
03:54:57,440 --> 03:55:00,440
and then we'll see what kind of team we're looking at

4385
03:55:00,440 --> 03:55:03,440
because I don't know what the deal is.

4386
03:55:11,440 --> 03:55:13,440
Bye!

4387
03:55:13,440 --> 03:55:15,440
Bye-bye!

4388
03:55:15,440 --> 03:55:18,440
We've got a little kiss on Sheeby's paws.

4389
03:55:18,440 --> 03:55:20,440
Okay, we did it!

4390
03:55:20,440 --> 03:55:23,440
Okay, I paused it, it says pause but don't worry,

4391
03:55:23,440 --> 03:55:26,440
it'll change its pickle in a second.

4392
03:55:26,440 --> 03:55:29,440
Right, we are gonna pop these wines

4393
03:55:29,440 --> 03:55:32,440
and then I'm gonna go for a pee.

4394
03:55:32,440 --> 03:55:35,440
Didn't she celebrate by playing League? She better not have.

4395
03:55:35,440 --> 03:55:38,440
I thought she did a hand cam stream where she really did one stuff.

4396
03:55:41,440 --> 03:55:44,440
She was wrong bleeding hearts. Yes, I want to watch that one

4397
03:55:44,440 --> 03:55:46,440
because I've not watched that one.

4398
03:55:47,440 --> 03:55:49,440
Did you like it?

4399
03:55:49,440 --> 03:55:52,440
There was a lot of clip-able moments.

4400
03:55:52,440 --> 03:55:56,440
I'm gonna maybe be naughty and go on Sheeby's account

4401
03:55:56,440 --> 03:55:59,440
and just gonna walk and check out who's been clippin' her

4402
03:55:59,440 --> 03:56:01,440
because the clip said...

4403
03:56:01,440 --> 03:56:04,440
Oh, I popped it! 95!

4404
03:56:04,440 --> 03:56:07,440
I thought it would... 95, let's go!

4405
03:56:07,440 --> 03:56:09,440
Level 95!

4406
03:56:09,440 --> 03:56:11,440
Level 95!

4407
03:56:11,440 --> 03:56:14,440
We can now make a summer pie!

4408
03:56:14,440 --> 03:56:16,440
Ooh!

4409
03:56:16,440 --> 03:56:18,440
A summer pie!

4410
03:56:18,440 --> 03:56:22,440
Only a cabillion more XP to go.

4411
03:56:22,440 --> 03:56:25,440
But we started at 30K.

4412
03:56:25,440 --> 03:56:30,440
We are now getting into the tens.

4413
03:56:30,440 --> 03:56:33,440
So that's really good for us.

4414
03:56:33,440 --> 03:56:36,440
Honestly, depending on how close it is,

4415
03:56:36,440 --> 03:56:39,440
I might be tempted to just do an all-nighter

4416
03:56:39,440 --> 03:56:42,440
and we'll get this shipped.

4417
03:56:42,440 --> 03:56:44,440
And then that'll be me...

4418
03:56:44,440 --> 03:56:47,440
Like, I can cross it off my goals list.

4419
03:56:47,440 --> 03:56:49,440
Only like 20...

4420
03:56:49,440 --> 03:56:51,440
I am considering it.

4421
03:56:51,440 --> 03:56:53,440
A summer pie... I don't even know what summer pie is.

4422
03:56:53,440 --> 03:56:55,440
Fruits, maybe?

4423
03:56:55,440 --> 03:56:58,440
Summer pie!

4424
03:56:58,440 --> 03:57:01,440
But yeah, I might lock in

4425
03:57:01,440 --> 03:57:05,440
and we'll do an all-nighter, possibly.

4426
03:57:05,440 --> 03:57:08,440
We are playing Blinks tomorrow.

4427
03:57:08,440 --> 03:57:12,440
How did you send a message with nothing in it?

4428
03:57:12,440 --> 03:57:15,440
Oh, okay, I did it as well. I'm sorry.

4429
03:57:15,440 --> 03:57:17,440
Um...

4430
03:57:17,440 --> 03:57:19,440
We are playing Blinks tomorrow,

4431
03:57:19,440 --> 03:57:22,440
which is like a strawberry watermelon and apple.

4432
03:57:22,440 --> 03:57:25,440
Here's a bit of sleep. I need to watch a cutfish goodnight.

4433
03:57:25,440 --> 03:57:29,440
I still need 40K wines.

4434
03:57:29,440 --> 03:57:32,440
I am thankfully at 20K right now.

4435
03:57:32,440 --> 03:57:34,440
Not to rub it in your face, but...

4436
03:57:34,440 --> 03:57:36,440
I'm at 20K.

4437
03:57:36,440 --> 03:57:38,440
If...

4438
03:57:38,440 --> 03:57:40,440
And it's like...

4439
03:57:40,440 --> 03:57:41,440
I don't know.

4440
03:57:41,440 --> 03:57:43,440
We'll know closer to the time

4441
03:57:43,440 --> 03:57:46,440
if we're there or not.

4442
03:57:46,440 --> 03:57:50,440
And if we could... I could maybe pop out the last endurance of it.

4443
03:57:50,440 --> 03:57:52,440
The last... No, I don't know how I'm going to say it,

4444
03:57:52,440 --> 03:57:54,440
because obviously right now we're only four hours in.

4445
03:57:54,440 --> 03:57:56,440
That's not really that rough.

4446
03:57:56,440 --> 03:57:59,440
But once we hit the, like, you know,

4447
03:57:59,440 --> 03:58:01,440
pushing the eight hour mark,

4448
03:58:01,440 --> 03:58:03,440
that's when the body starts becoming weary.

4449
03:58:03,440 --> 03:58:06,440
And I'm like, ooh, you know?

4450
03:58:06,440 --> 03:58:09,440
You can rub something in our faces.

4451
03:58:09,440 --> 03:58:11,440
It's my peaches and stuff.

4452
03:58:11,440 --> 03:58:13,440
I don't need sleep. I need to cook!

4453
03:58:13,440 --> 03:58:15,440
I need to ferment this wine.

4454
03:58:15,440 --> 03:58:17,440
That's what I need to deal with.

4455
03:58:17,440 --> 03:58:19,440
And then we'll go to the Grand Exchange

4456
03:58:19,440 --> 03:58:21,440
and sell all the wines off for, like, pennies.

4457
03:58:21,440 --> 03:58:23,440
Like, literal pennies.

4458
03:58:23,440 --> 03:58:25,440
Mmm.

4459
03:58:25,440 --> 03:58:27,440
Right.

4460
03:58:27,440 --> 03:58:29,440
I would like to urge everyone,

4461
03:58:29,440 --> 03:58:31,440
please get up and stretch your legs.

4462
03:58:31,440 --> 03:58:33,440
Please go to the toilet. Please get a drink.

4463
03:58:33,440 --> 03:58:35,440
Please get food.

4464
03:58:35,440 --> 03:58:37,440
I am going to be a solid five minutes,

4465
03:58:37,440 --> 03:58:39,440
because I'm going to put...

4466
03:58:39,440 --> 03:58:41,440
I'm going to put chicken in the air fryer.

4467
03:58:41,440 --> 03:58:43,440
Like, it's like this breaded chicken.

4468
03:58:43,440 --> 03:58:45,440
So I will need to go get it in 20 minutes

4469
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:47,440
when it's ready.

4470
03:58:47,440 --> 03:58:49,440
But please do get food. Please do stretch.

4471
03:58:49,440 --> 03:58:51,440
I'm going to get a cup of tea. I'm going to get water.

4472
03:58:51,440 --> 03:58:53,440
I'm going to see if I've got any fizzy juice as well.

4473
03:58:53,440 --> 03:58:55,440
I always make sure to get every...

4474
03:58:55,440 --> 03:58:57,440
up every two hours.

4475
03:58:57,440 --> 03:58:59,440
Yes, I do that too, wink, wink.

4476
03:58:59,440 --> 03:59:01,440
You can ferment yourself for the reef.

4477
03:59:01,440 --> 03:59:03,440
What does that mean? What does that mean?

4478
03:59:03,440 --> 03:59:05,440
My legs.

4479
03:59:05,440 --> 03:59:07,440
I can't feel my legs.

4480
03:59:07,440 --> 03:59:09,440
I was like, I said I'm going to...

4481
03:59:09,440 --> 03:59:11,440
I already baked a loaf of bread yesterday.

4482
03:59:11,440 --> 03:59:13,440
I had to squeeze that fucker out.

4483
03:59:13,440 --> 03:59:15,440
Ah, that's disgusting.

4484
03:59:15,440 --> 03:59:17,440
Shut ups for me, honestly.

4485
03:59:17,440 --> 03:59:19,440
Right.

4486
03:59:19,440 --> 03:59:21,440
I will be back in five minutes.

4487
03:59:21,440 --> 03:59:23,440
And then we will

4488
03:59:23,440 --> 03:59:25,440
watch Amy's

4489
03:59:25,440 --> 03:59:27,440
Poppin Cooking,

4490
03:59:27,440 --> 03:59:29,440
I believe it is called.

4491
03:59:29,440 --> 03:59:31,440
And she brings out her lovely jubbly

4492
03:59:31,440 --> 03:59:33,440
rats. I believe it's a two hour long

4493
03:59:33,440 --> 03:59:35,440
bod. And then we'll do a

4494
03:59:35,440 --> 03:59:37,440
zura.

4495
03:59:37,440 --> 03:59:39,440
And then we'll see what kind of time we're looking at.

4496
03:59:39,440 --> 03:59:41,440
Because I don't know if I have enough time

4497
03:59:41,440 --> 03:59:43,440
between to watch everyone

4498
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:45,440
unless it is endurance.

4499
03:59:45,440 --> 03:59:47,440
I don't know.

4500
03:59:47,440 --> 03:59:49,440
Lieutenant Dan, you ain't got no legs.

4501
03:59:49,440 --> 03:59:51,440
Even though I've not seen that film.

4502
03:59:51,440 --> 03:59:53,440
Right, I'm going to be a solid

4503
03:59:53,440 --> 03:59:55,440
freaking four or five minutes.

4504
03:59:55,440 --> 03:59:57,440
The way I do it is I have to

4505
03:59:57,440 --> 03:59:59,440
boil the kettle first.

4506
03:59:59,440 --> 04:00:01,440
And then I go pee while the thing

4507
04:00:01,440 --> 04:00:03,440
boils.

4508
04:00:03,440 --> 04:00:05,440
And then I go in the fridge and shove stuff

4509
04:00:05,440 --> 04:00:07,440
in the microwave or whatever.

4510
04:00:07,440 --> 04:00:09,440
And then normally Gimli and Vigo

4511
04:00:09,440 --> 04:00:11,440
come flying around and asking me

4512
04:00:11,440 --> 04:00:13,440
for a licky lick. And I'm like, right, right,

4513
04:00:13,440 --> 04:00:15,440
I'll give you a licky lick.

4514
04:00:15,440 --> 04:00:17,440
They're really patient, actually,

4515
04:00:17,440 --> 04:00:19,440
when I do an endurance cream, which I'm really

4516
04:00:19,440 --> 04:00:21,440
lucky with. Do you have a breath pee?

4517
04:00:21,440 --> 04:00:23,440
I'm so sorry.

4518
04:00:23,440 --> 04:00:25,440
Dear hero, I don't know.

4519
04:00:29,440 --> 04:00:31,440
Microwaving maxing, which they take

4520
04:00:31,440 --> 04:00:33,440
your time to bring yourself out.

4521
04:00:33,440 --> 04:00:35,440
Burn myself out. I got

4522
04:00:35,440 --> 04:00:37,440
head to work. I'll still be able to listen.

4523
04:00:37,440 --> 04:00:39,440
Ooh, lurking in the shadows.

4524
04:00:39,440 --> 04:00:41,440
Okay.

4525
04:00:41,440 --> 04:00:43,440
I will very quickly go get all that

4526
04:00:43,440 --> 04:00:45,440
done. I'm just going to get one more, one more

4527
04:00:45,440 --> 04:00:47,440
wine in, okay? One more wine in.

4528
04:00:47,440 --> 04:00:49,440
Let me click, let me click. Ready, steady,

4529
04:00:49,440 --> 04:00:51,440
go!

4530
04:01:05,440 --> 04:01:07,440
Okay.

4531
04:01:35,440 --> 04:01:37,440
Okay.

4532
04:02:05,440 --> 04:02:07,440
Okay.

4533
04:02:35,440 --> 04:02:37,440
Okay.

4534
04:03:05,440 --> 04:03:07,440
Okay.

4535
04:03:35,440 --> 04:03:37,440
Okay.

4536
04:04:05,440 --> 04:04:07,440
Okay.

4537
04:04:35,440 --> 04:04:37,440
Okay.

4538
04:05:05,440 --> 04:05:07,440
Okay.

4539
04:05:35,440 --> 04:05:37,440
Okay.

4540
04:06:05,440 --> 04:06:07,440
Okay.

4541
04:06:35,440 --> 04:06:37,440
Okay.

4542
04:07:05,440 --> 04:07:07,440
Okay.

4543
04:07:35,440 --> 04:07:37,440
Okay.

4544
04:08:05,440 --> 04:08:07,440
Okay.

4545
04:08:35,440 --> 04:08:37,440
Okay.

4546
04:09:05,440 --> 04:09:07,440
Okay.

4547
04:09:31,440 --> 04:09:33,440
Oh, no, this can't be.

4548
04:09:33,440 --> 04:09:35,440
Okay.

4549
04:09:37,440 --> 04:09:39,440
Oh, yeah.

4550
04:09:39,440 --> 04:09:41,440
I'm back.

4551
04:09:41,440 --> 04:09:43,440
Let me in. Let me in.

4552
04:09:45,440 --> 04:09:47,440
My food is going to take six

4553
04:09:47,440 --> 04:09:49,440
minutes, so I'm going to go back

4554
04:09:49,440 --> 04:09:51,440
in like a millisecond.

4555
04:09:51,440 --> 04:09:53,440
But I just need to grab it

4556
04:09:53,440 --> 04:09:55,440
out of the air fryer, so it's not a problem.

4557
04:09:55,440 --> 04:09:57,440
It's not like an issue or anything like that.

4558
04:09:57,440 --> 04:09:59,440
Okay.

4559
04:09:59,440 --> 04:10:01,440
Hmm.

4560
04:10:01,440 --> 04:10:03,440
Boy, Ray kuma,

4561
04:10:03,440 --> 04:10:05,440
momolowe and cam keos, don't think

4562
04:10:05,440 --> 04:10:07,440
I don't see you. Don't think I don't see

4563
04:10:07,440 --> 04:10:09,440
what you're doing.

4564
04:10:09,440 --> 04:10:11,440
I'm so old. I remember

4565
04:10:11,440 --> 04:10:13,440
when runescape yet to let your character

4566
04:10:13,440 --> 04:10:15,440
sleep. Is that real?

4567
04:10:15,440 --> 04:10:17,440
I say Xtorsion

4568
04:10:17,440 --> 04:10:19,440
one the Xtorsion rey fun.

4569
04:10:19,440 --> 04:10:21,440
I didn't even,

4570
04:10:21,440 --> 04:10:23,440
I do not,

4571
04:10:23,440 --> 04:10:25,440
not at all.

4572
04:10:25,440 --> 04:10:31,440
She got us. Caught you in 4k, so our stream elements is figure it catch me now.

4573
04:10:31,440 --> 04:10:36,440
Yeah, back in classic it had a fatigue mechanic.

4574
04:10:36,440 --> 04:10:39,440
Oh, I didn't know anything about that.

4575
04:10:39,440 --> 04:10:43,440
I'm actually such a fake RuneScape fan that I didn't even know that.

4576
04:10:43,440 --> 04:10:45,440
Such a fake gamer.

4577
04:10:45,440 --> 04:10:49,440
Such a fake, fake, fake gamer.

4578
04:10:49,440 --> 04:10:53,440
What's that? You don't know the name of the director's cousin?

4579
04:10:53,440 --> 04:10:57,440
Oh, fake fan. You didn't play the game. You're just pretending.

4580
04:10:57,440 --> 04:11:01,440
Did I tell you guys I did that to someone one time?

4581
04:11:01,440 --> 04:11:05,440
They were like, I can't remember. It was in another life.

4582
04:11:05,440 --> 04:11:09,440
And it wasn't the last life. It was the other other life.

4583
04:11:09,440 --> 04:11:15,440
And he was like, oh, why do you talk about games all the time?

4584
04:11:15,440 --> 04:11:17,440
Like, why do you say that you play games?

4585
04:11:17,440 --> 04:11:20,440
And I was like, I used to talk about it as a subject in general.

4586
04:11:20,440 --> 04:11:23,440
So I DM'd back sarcastically.

4587
04:11:23,440 --> 04:11:26,440
And I was like, message back sarcastically.

4588
04:11:26,440 --> 04:11:30,440
Like, oh, I just pretend to like games to get guys' attention.

4589
04:11:30,440 --> 04:11:35,440
And it backfired horrendously because he actually genuinely believed that.

4590
04:11:35,440 --> 04:11:38,440
And he probably still to this day believes it because he'll be like,

4591
04:11:38,440 --> 04:11:42,440
oh, I spoke to a girl one time and she said she did it for male attention.

4592
04:11:42,440 --> 04:11:47,440
I was like, oh, it was the fact they didn't even question it.

4593
04:11:47,440 --> 04:11:50,440
I was like, it was clearly sarcastic.

4594
04:11:50,440 --> 04:11:54,440
I was like, oh, I just pretend I like video games to get guys' attention.

4595
04:11:54,440 --> 04:11:57,440
Like, what? And he believed it.

4596
04:11:57,440 --> 04:12:05,440
So that guy now has a fallacy about girls pretending to enjoy video games.

4597
04:12:05,440 --> 04:12:13,440
So just in case you wanted to use humor and sarcasm against via text,

4598
04:12:13,440 --> 04:12:16,440
it does not work unless someone can hear the tone of your voice.

4599
04:12:16,440 --> 04:12:18,440
You literally fail for it. You have all of her attention.

4600
04:12:18,440 --> 04:12:21,440
To be fair, there are girls that do that.

4601
04:12:21,440 --> 04:12:28,440
I can't imagine a girl sitting through all the harassment of playing a multiplayer game

4602
04:12:28,440 --> 04:12:30,440
just to be like, I do this for attention.

4603
04:12:30,440 --> 04:12:34,440
Unless I'm misunderstanding what you mean.

4604
04:12:34,440 --> 04:12:37,440
I can't imagine that.

4605
04:12:37,440 --> 04:12:39,440
Did you not type I'm kidding?

4606
04:12:40,440 --> 04:12:44,440
I think either they never responded or they responded with like,

4607
04:12:44,440 --> 04:12:47,440
oh, thanks for clarifying.

4608
04:12:47,440 --> 04:12:48,440
Have a nice day.

4609
04:12:48,440 --> 04:12:50,440
The conversation ended after the message.

4610
04:12:50,440 --> 04:12:53,440
So it wasn't like I was like, bro, I'm obviously joking.

4611
04:12:53,440 --> 04:12:55,440
I just sit and play games like anyone else.

4612
04:12:55,440 --> 04:12:57,440
I have access to video games.

4613
04:12:57,440 --> 04:12:59,440
You have access to video games.

4614
04:12:59,440 --> 04:13:01,440
It's nothing special.

4615
04:13:01,440 --> 04:13:03,440
You underestimate mental illness.

4616
04:13:03,440 --> 04:13:04,440
No.

4617
04:13:04,440 --> 04:13:05,440
But that's what I'm saying.

4618
04:13:05,440 --> 04:13:07,440
Now that guy like straight up has a fallacy.

4619
04:13:07,440 --> 04:13:09,440
Like, girl, girl pretend.

4620
04:13:09,440 --> 04:13:12,440
People do more and worse things for attention.

4621
04:13:12,440 --> 04:13:13,440
To be fair, it's working on us.

4622
04:13:13,440 --> 04:13:14,440
Oh, yeah.

4623
04:13:14,440 --> 04:13:17,440
You think that this is a live stream and not pre-recorded?

4624
04:13:17,440 --> 04:13:20,440
Because apparently all my streams are pre-recorded met us.

4625
04:13:20,440 --> 04:13:22,440
How dare you.

4626
04:13:22,440 --> 04:13:28,440
She just makes videos with controllers and things and say that I'm a gamer.

4627
04:13:28,440 --> 04:13:32,440
Real me posing with a controller.

4628
04:13:32,440 --> 04:13:38,440
Actually, I know a girl that tried to play Rinscape to get a guy's attention.

4629
04:13:38,440 --> 04:13:42,440
You know, go give it to her.

4630
04:13:42,440 --> 04:13:44,440
Some people fake hobbies in general.

4631
04:13:44,440 --> 04:13:45,440
I don't know why though.

4632
04:13:45,440 --> 04:13:52,440
I think some people might feel that they don't have value.

4633
04:13:52,440 --> 04:13:55,440
If they don't have something they pursue.

4634
04:13:55,440 --> 04:13:57,440
But you don't have to pursue anything.

4635
04:13:57,440 --> 04:13:58,440
I mean, like, shit.

4636
04:13:58,440 --> 04:14:01,440
If you want to tell, if you want to say what my hobbies are,

4637
04:14:01,440 --> 04:14:05,440
playing video games, drinking cola, and being a weirdo,

4638
04:14:05,440 --> 04:14:07,440
and going into people's gardens to collect seeds.

4639
04:14:07,440 --> 04:14:11,440
Like, you don't need to be interested in to have value.

4640
04:14:11,440 --> 04:14:15,440
You can be the most, like, normal, plain Jane type thing.

4641
04:14:15,440 --> 04:14:18,440
I think maybe that's why people would try and lie.

4642
04:14:18,440 --> 04:14:21,440
And to make themselves seem more exciting and more...

4643
04:14:21,440 --> 04:14:24,440
Because obviously you want social favour with people.

4644
04:14:24,440 --> 04:14:30,440
And, you know, if it's your perception that the group around you would like that you're a gamer,

4645
04:14:30,440 --> 04:14:32,440
because they talk about games.

4646
04:14:32,440 --> 04:14:34,440
And yeah, you might be like, oh, I've heard of that game.

4647
04:14:34,440 --> 04:14:35,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4648
04:14:35,440 --> 04:14:37,440
But the reality is maybe you've only heard about it in passing.

4649
04:14:37,440 --> 04:14:39,440
And, you know, you read an article.

4650
04:14:39,440 --> 04:14:41,440
It's just the next Dark Souls type thing.

4651
04:14:41,440 --> 04:14:44,440
I've wasted 25 years of your life?

4652
04:14:44,440 --> 04:14:46,440
No, you've not.

4653
04:14:46,440 --> 04:14:49,440
Don't make me put my tinfoil hat on.

4654
04:14:49,440 --> 04:14:51,440
You cannot waste life.

4655
04:14:51,440 --> 04:14:57,440
Because if you're telling me your value only comes by being a cog in the machine,

4656
04:14:57,440 --> 04:14:59,440
it's over for you.

4657
04:14:59,440 --> 04:15:02,440
Hey guys, Strone Stream Script to here.

4658
04:15:02,440 --> 04:15:08,440
Did you like the tongue and cheek jokes Strone just made about scripting and pre-recording streams?

4659
04:15:08,440 --> 04:15:14,440
We're playing about with meta-humour, so give us feedback and we'll improve the script.

4660
04:15:14,440 --> 04:15:16,440
You're actually done.

4661
04:15:19,440 --> 04:15:21,440
So give us feedback and we'll improve the script.

4662
04:15:21,440 --> 04:15:23,440
You're actually done.

4663
04:15:23,440 --> 04:15:24,440
Thank you for the tip.

4664
04:15:24,440 --> 04:15:28,440
Strone Stream Scripts are...

4665
04:15:28,440 --> 04:15:30,440
Something I'm not on to you.

4666
04:15:32,440 --> 04:15:34,440
This is obviously a pre-recorded stream.

4667
04:15:34,440 --> 04:15:37,440
Strone is in hypnosis and clairvoyance.

4668
04:15:37,440 --> 04:15:39,440
Oh my god, I got a really nice comment.

4669
04:15:39,440 --> 04:15:43,440
That was like, oh, even though I don't, like, consume your content,

4670
04:15:43,440 --> 04:15:46,440
I can just tell that, like, you're a trustworthy hypnotist and I'm like,

4671
04:15:46,440 --> 04:15:50,440
oh my fucking god, you're like, stop.

4672
04:15:50,440 --> 04:15:55,440
Like, even being allocated the title hypnotist, I'm like,

4673
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:59,440
stop, I will cream my custards right now.

4674
04:15:59,440 --> 04:16:00,440
I think Strone Streams are live.

4675
04:16:00,440 --> 04:16:03,440
She just pre-records her streams as the other girls.

4676
04:16:03,440 --> 04:16:05,440
What are you talking about?

4677
04:16:05,440 --> 04:16:06,440
Snowberries.

4678
04:16:06,440 --> 04:16:09,440
I have no idea.

4679
04:16:09,440 --> 04:16:13,440
Anyway, I think Amy is streaming later.

4680
04:16:13,440 --> 04:16:15,440
But I'm really laying on that accent there.

4681
04:16:15,440 --> 04:16:17,440
I don't want a little bit of shite, a little bit of shite.

4682
04:16:17,440 --> 04:16:20,440
Yeah, the rest of us were here last week to record this footage.

4683
04:16:20,440 --> 04:16:23,440
Oh my god, real in-game footage.

4684
04:16:23,440 --> 04:16:26,440
The reflands came together to make this legit.

4685
04:16:26,440 --> 04:16:29,440
Blowing into people's gardens to collect seeds.

4686
04:16:29,440 --> 04:16:30,440
Is that a euphemism?

4687
04:16:30,440 --> 04:16:32,440
No, I collect seeds.

4688
04:16:32,440 --> 04:16:35,440
I just find them really fascinating.

4689
04:16:35,440 --> 04:16:39,440
There's that big Norwegian bunker in the ice, perma-ice,

4690
04:16:39,440 --> 04:16:41,440
that's like frozen all the seeds.

4691
04:16:41,440 --> 04:16:43,440
I would love to visit there one day,

4692
04:16:43,440 --> 04:16:46,440
but I don't even think it's accessible to the public.

4693
04:16:46,440 --> 04:16:48,440
But that's my dream date.

4694
04:16:48,440 --> 04:16:50,440
Cheeky bit of Lord of the Rings, cheeky bit of Takeaway,

4695
04:16:50,440 --> 04:16:52,440
and we go to that bunker all the seeds in it

4696
04:16:52,440 --> 04:16:57,440
just so I can look and observe at the absolute beauty

4697
04:16:57,440 --> 04:17:00,440
that Mother Nature is in her diversity,

4698
04:17:00,440 --> 04:17:03,440
in her perseverance, in her just-

4699
04:17:03,440 --> 04:17:06,440
oh, in awe, awe.

4700
04:17:06,440 --> 04:17:09,440
Cannae, just gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

4701
04:17:09,440 --> 04:17:12,440
The diversity in how nature overcomes

4702
04:17:12,440 --> 04:17:16,440
and becomes such unique organisms

4703
04:17:16,440 --> 04:17:18,440
is just fantastic.

4704
04:17:18,440 --> 04:17:20,440
That's what it really is.

4705
04:17:22,440 --> 04:17:26,440
I think I can smell that my ear fryer is done.

4706
04:17:26,440 --> 04:17:28,440
Global Seed Vault, you should travel a lot

4707
04:17:28,440 --> 04:17:31,440
to see more and more seeds along here.

4708
04:17:32,440 --> 04:17:35,440
Is that what I think it is?

4709
04:17:35,440 --> 04:17:38,440
Is that an in-bait for me to ask?

4710
04:17:38,440 --> 04:17:40,440
Right, I'm gonna go very quickly

4711
04:17:40,440 --> 04:17:44,440
get my chicken tendies as I chuckle my spit unironically.

4712
04:17:45,440 --> 04:17:48,440
Fucking, it's a bit dry in here.

4713
04:17:48,440 --> 04:17:49,440
Yeah, damn.

4714
04:17:49,440 --> 04:17:51,440
Right, I'll be one second.

4715
04:18:14,440 --> 04:18:15,440
Okay.

4716
04:18:37,440 --> 04:18:38,440
I hit no.

4717
04:18:38,440 --> 04:18:41,440
Reflings, look, I don't judge if it's floppy

4718
04:18:41,440 --> 04:18:43,440
or it's hard, but that chicken looked a bit floppy

4719
04:18:43,440 --> 04:18:45,440
so I'll put it in for another two minutes.

4720
04:18:45,440 --> 04:18:47,440
It was a bit too floppy for me.

4721
04:18:47,440 --> 04:18:49,440
A bit too floppy.

4722
04:18:49,440 --> 04:18:51,440
I don't know, she's lost efficiency.

4723
04:18:51,440 --> 04:18:52,440
Stop.

4724
04:18:52,440 --> 04:18:54,440
Come on, guys.

4725
04:18:54,440 --> 04:18:56,440
Thank you, Momolo, Aipu, Rekumon, Kamki.

4726
04:18:56,440 --> 04:18:59,440
My kitchen's literally right there, so, you know.

4727
04:18:59,440 --> 04:19:01,440
Literally, it was floppy.

4728
04:19:01,440 --> 04:19:04,440
I'm like, no, I'm gonna put you back in.

4729
04:19:04,440 --> 04:19:07,440
Just a little bit back in for a bit longer.

4730
04:19:08,440 --> 04:19:11,440
I'm not messing with floppy chicken.

4731
04:19:11,440 --> 04:19:13,440
The medium girlfriend ties you down

4732
04:19:13,440 --> 04:19:15,440
and tells you about C's ASMR.

4733
04:19:15,440 --> 04:19:18,440
So, I think the title would probably

4734
04:19:18,440 --> 04:19:20,440
just be autistic girlfriend rambles

4735
04:19:20,440 --> 04:19:22,440
about her seed collection,

4736
04:19:22,440 --> 04:19:24,440
but then I'll just straight up start putting

4737
04:19:24,440 --> 04:19:26,440
actual pictures of my seeds on the screen

4738
04:19:26,440 --> 04:19:29,440
and be like, hey, this is the one I collected.

4739
04:19:32,440 --> 04:19:34,440
That chicken got that, it's a bit flaccid.

4740
04:19:34,440 --> 04:19:37,440
Yeah, I'm not sure it can go inside me

4741
04:19:37,440 --> 04:19:39,440
if it's a bit flaccid.

4742
04:19:39,440 --> 04:19:41,440
Yay, yay, zing, get it, get it,

4743
04:19:41,440 --> 04:19:45,440
because I'm talking about floppy salmonella chicken.

4744
04:19:45,440 --> 04:19:47,440
And nothing else.

4745
04:19:47,440 --> 04:19:49,440
Nothing else can be ascertained

4746
04:19:49,440 --> 04:19:51,440
from that string of sentences.

4747
04:19:51,440 --> 04:19:53,440
Hardy, hardy, hard.

4748
04:19:53,440 --> 04:19:56,440
Listening to a girl who's super in her hobby is interesting.

4749
04:19:56,440 --> 04:19:58,440
Aw, I'm sure about that.

4750
04:19:58,440 --> 04:20:00,440
It needs to be harder, honestly,

4751
04:20:00,440 --> 04:20:02,440
but it actually comes from her seed collection.

4752
04:20:02,440 --> 04:20:04,440
It's just me jumping on your lap

4753
04:20:04,440 --> 04:20:06,440
and, you know, going,

4754
04:20:07,440 --> 04:20:10,440
Right, once my food is here,

4755
04:20:10,440 --> 04:20:13,440
we will put on Emma's lovely wee vlog.

4756
04:20:13,440 --> 04:20:15,440
What are we at?

4757
04:20:15,440 --> 04:20:17,440
We're almost, I want the 19s.

4758
04:20:17,440 --> 04:20:20,440
I'm a bit, I'm actually thinking.

4759
04:20:20,440 --> 04:20:22,440
Right, hear me out, this is what I'm thinking.

4760
04:20:22,440 --> 04:20:24,440
We do an endurance stream,

4761
04:20:24,440 --> 04:20:27,440
which will leave us with maybe four hours

4762
04:20:27,440 --> 04:20:29,440
to finish it off, okay?

4763
04:20:29,440 --> 04:20:31,440
Rather than doing an all-nighter,

4764
04:20:31,440 --> 04:20:33,440
which is going to be catastrophic to my already

4765
04:20:33,440 --> 04:20:36,440
catastrophic, catastrophic health

4766
04:20:36,440 --> 04:20:38,440
that's already in the gutter.

4767
04:20:38,440 --> 04:20:41,440
Instead, I will do a catch-up stream

4768
04:20:41,440 --> 04:20:43,440
where we finish Sonic Heroes Chaos,

4769
04:20:43,440 --> 04:20:45,440
we finish RuneScape 99,

4770
04:20:45,440 --> 04:20:49,440
and we finish the DLC on a little to the left,

4771
04:20:49,440 --> 04:20:52,440
because apparently there's a DLC on that game

4772
04:20:52,440 --> 04:20:54,440
that I didn't play,

4773
04:20:54,440 --> 04:20:56,440
and I really enjoyed a little to the left.

4774
04:20:56,440 --> 04:20:58,440
So we'll call it the finishing stream,

4775
04:20:58,440 --> 04:21:01,440
because I've edged you with the other things.

4776
04:21:01,440 --> 04:21:03,440
That sounds like a deal.

4777
04:21:03,440 --> 04:21:06,440
Wait, Sonic, you didn't even done the part

4778
04:21:06,440 --> 04:21:08,440
where you say what you would do at your dinner.

4779
04:21:08,440 --> 04:21:10,440
Oh!

4780
04:21:13,440 --> 04:21:16,440
Obviously, I see, like, the princess treatment.

4781
04:21:16,440 --> 04:21:18,440
She gives me brat tamer vibes

4782
04:21:18,440 --> 04:21:20,440
where she pretends she doesn't like it,

4783
04:21:20,440 --> 04:21:23,440
but it's just so obvious that she does.

4784
04:21:23,440 --> 04:21:25,440
Like, no matter what you do,

4785
04:21:25,440 --> 04:21:27,440
she deep down wants to please you

4786
04:21:27,440 --> 04:21:29,440
and pretends to be, like, she needs tamed,

4787
04:21:29,440 --> 04:21:31,440
but it only takes you a couple of minutes,

4788
04:21:31,440 --> 04:21:33,440
and, you know, she's already, like,

4789
04:21:33,440 --> 04:21:35,440
putty in your hands, type thing.

4790
04:21:35,440 --> 04:21:39,440
Emmy, everyone's really gone harsh on Emmy.

4791
04:21:39,440 --> 04:21:41,440
Ah!

4792
04:21:41,440 --> 04:21:44,440
Look, Emmy's gone through something traumatic.

4793
04:21:44,440 --> 04:21:46,440
I will never be able to replace her brother.

4794
04:21:46,440 --> 04:21:49,440
I've accepted that fact.

4795
04:21:49,440 --> 04:21:52,440
So what Emmy actually needs

4796
04:21:52,440 --> 04:21:56,440
is just an experience to bide her time, okay?

4797
04:21:56,440 --> 04:21:59,440
So I'm going to leave Emmy intact

4798
04:21:59,440 --> 04:22:04,440
because that V-card is for the pin pals, okay?

4799
04:22:04,440 --> 04:22:07,440
And instead, I'd rather do

4800
04:22:07,440 --> 04:22:11,440
a peril stimulation on her.

4801
04:22:11,440 --> 04:22:15,440
Just simple, basic, nothing really else to it.

4802
04:22:15,440 --> 04:22:18,440
You know, just tongue type thing

4803
04:22:18,440 --> 04:22:20,440
and just listen to her squirm, all that kind of thing.

4804
04:22:20,440 --> 04:22:23,440
Like, force the legs open kind of deal.

4805
04:22:23,440 --> 04:22:25,440
Just keep her intact, you know?

4806
04:22:25,440 --> 04:22:28,440
Go leave her for the pin pals.

4807
04:22:28,440 --> 04:22:31,440
Mersey, Mersey's definitely vanilla,

4808
04:22:31,440 --> 04:22:33,440
so you need to take it easy,

4809
04:22:33,440 --> 04:22:36,440
but what you need to do is enable her

4810
04:22:36,440 --> 04:22:38,440
to be comfortable in the environment

4811
04:22:38,440 --> 04:22:40,440
that you're prepping.

4812
04:22:40,440 --> 04:22:42,440
And she has said that she's into pet play,

4813
04:22:42,440 --> 04:22:45,440
so you need to very gently enter that space.

4814
04:22:45,440 --> 04:22:48,440
Let her enter that space while you enable her

4815
04:22:48,440 --> 04:22:51,440
in terms of, like, a collar, a leash,

4816
04:22:52,440 --> 04:22:55,440
maybe even just the threat of accessories

4817
04:22:55,440 --> 04:23:00,440
such as a dog cage or a bowl of milk, for example,

4818
04:23:00,440 --> 04:23:03,440
that kind of thing.

4819
04:23:03,440 --> 04:23:06,440
You kind of need to be gentle with Mersey,

4820
04:23:06,440 --> 04:23:08,440
but you need to let her at any moment,

4821
04:23:08,440 --> 04:23:10,440
like, be able to be like, I don't want this

4822
04:23:10,440 --> 04:23:13,440
and that's absolutely perfectly fine.

4823
04:23:13,440 --> 04:23:18,440
It would just be probably figuratively nice and easy

4824
04:23:19,440 --> 04:23:21,440
on her force.

4825
04:23:21,440 --> 04:23:24,440
If she's doing pet play, she's getting treated like a pup,

4826
04:23:24,440 --> 04:23:26,440
so, on her force.

4827
04:23:26,440 --> 04:23:28,440
And she's not allowed to speak,

4828
04:23:28,440 --> 04:23:31,440
so maybe like a bone gag in her mouth would be really cute.

4829
04:23:31,440 --> 04:23:34,440
Where are you getting these ideas from?

4830
04:23:34,440 --> 04:23:35,440
My head?

4831
04:23:35,440 --> 04:23:37,440
Western work.

4832
04:23:37,440 --> 04:23:39,440
You thought I'd pre-written these down or something?

4833
04:23:39,440 --> 04:23:41,440
No, this is coming from me.

4834
04:23:41,440 --> 04:23:44,440
It would be a bag of milk, actually.

4835
04:23:44,440 --> 04:23:46,440
How dare you.

4836
04:23:46,440 --> 04:23:49,440
She be...

4837
04:23:49,440 --> 04:23:53,440
Because she's been given the dominant role,

4838
04:23:53,440 --> 04:23:56,440
I think it would be nice

4839
04:23:56,440 --> 04:23:59,440
if she just got sozzled on some wine

4840
04:23:59,440 --> 04:24:02,440
in, like, whatever happens, happens type thing.

4841
04:24:02,440 --> 04:24:04,440
She doesn't have to be in a role.

4842
04:24:04,440 --> 04:24:06,440
She doesn't have to play the authoritative figure.

4843
04:24:06,440 --> 04:24:08,440
She doesn't have to be the dominant figure.

4844
04:24:08,440 --> 04:24:10,440
It's just whatever happens happens.

4845
04:24:10,440 --> 04:24:12,440
It's a giggle fest, you know,

4846
04:24:12,440 --> 04:24:16,440
things are being touched and felt and experienced

4847
04:24:16,440 --> 04:24:22,440
and, you know, probably the...

4848
04:24:22,440 --> 04:24:24,440
I don't know, she mentioned toys.

4849
04:24:24,440 --> 04:24:26,440
It's probably the, like, vibrator kind of stuff.

4850
04:24:26,440 --> 04:24:29,440
Just, like, having a giggle and be a relaxed atmosphere.

4851
04:24:29,440 --> 04:24:32,440
Azura scares me.

4852
04:24:32,440 --> 04:24:34,440
I don't even...

4853
04:24:34,440 --> 04:24:38,440
Azura scares me.

4854
04:24:38,440 --> 04:24:39,440
Azura scares me.

4855
04:24:39,440 --> 04:24:41,440
Okay, if, for whatever reason,

4856
04:24:41,440 --> 04:24:45,440
I could remove her ability to become a giantess...

4857
04:24:45,440 --> 04:24:48,440
Oh, hold on a minute.

4858
04:24:51,440 --> 04:24:53,440
Make her become a giantess,

4859
04:24:53,440 --> 04:24:55,440
then I can do some exploring.

4860
04:24:55,440 --> 04:24:58,440
You know what I'm saying?

4861
04:24:58,440 --> 04:25:01,440
Ooh, would she be into that?

4862
04:25:01,440 --> 04:25:03,440
I don't know.

4863
04:25:03,440 --> 04:25:05,440
Hmm.

4864
04:25:08,440 --> 04:25:11,440
No, I don't think I'll do that.

4865
04:25:11,440 --> 04:25:14,440
Splunking? No, not splunking, Azura.

4866
04:25:14,440 --> 04:25:17,440
Azura scares you, you should be scared.

4867
04:25:17,440 --> 04:25:20,440
She knows I should be into that.

4868
04:25:20,440 --> 04:25:24,440
No, but you'll be into her! Hey!

4869
04:25:24,440 --> 04:25:27,440
Okay, I'm going to do a very quick one,

4870
04:25:27,440 --> 04:25:32,440
and then go get my chicken that surely is erect by now.

4871
04:25:32,440 --> 04:25:34,440
So I don't want any fluffy chicken. I'll be right...

4872
04:25:34,440 --> 04:25:36,440
I'll be having it!

4873
04:26:32,440 --> 04:26:35,440
I'll be having it!

4874
04:26:35,440 --> 04:26:38,440
I'll be having it!

4875
04:27:01,440 --> 04:27:04,440
Stop giving me money for walking away, honestly.

4876
04:27:04,440 --> 04:27:07,440
You guys haven't seen it in a while.

4877
04:27:07,440 --> 04:27:09,440
Wow.

4878
04:27:09,440 --> 04:27:12,440
Thank you very much, Kalka and Zarian.

4879
04:27:12,440 --> 04:27:14,440
But knock it off, okay?

4880
04:27:14,440 --> 04:27:17,440
A bunch of yapping is what you miss.

4881
04:27:19,440 --> 04:27:21,440
After the grocery shop.

4882
04:27:21,440 --> 04:27:24,440
Any grocery shoppers?

4883
04:27:24,440 --> 04:27:26,440
Eh, right.

4884
04:27:26,440 --> 04:27:31,440
Let's get prepared to play Amy's Vod, okay?

4885
04:27:31,440 --> 04:27:34,440
Eh, I'm going to go a little bit quiet,

4886
04:27:34,440 --> 04:27:36,440
because I would like to munch my face off,

4887
04:27:36,440 --> 04:27:38,440
if that's okay with you guys, right? Hold on.

4888
04:27:38,440 --> 04:27:42,440
Give me a cheeky bit of Amy Vizu,

4889
04:27:42,440 --> 04:27:44,440
a poppin' chicken.

4890
04:27:44,440 --> 04:27:48,440
Amy Vizu, poppin' chicken.

4891
04:27:48,440 --> 04:27:51,440
I actually bought this stuff for that.

4892
04:27:51,440 --> 04:27:54,440
Oh, it's three hours long, it's a big Vod.

4893
04:27:54,440 --> 04:27:56,440
I saw.

4894
04:27:56,440 --> 04:27:58,440
This is definitely the one with the rats,

4895
04:27:58,440 --> 04:28:00,440
because all the rats are in it!

4896
04:28:01,440 --> 04:28:03,440
Ah, do this correctly.

4897
04:28:03,440 --> 04:28:08,440
Right, first, let's yank the title of the stream.

4898
04:28:08,440 --> 04:28:11,440
We're watching Making Candy with Pimpelz

4899
04:28:11,440 --> 04:28:16,440
on Amy Vizu.

4900
04:28:16,440 --> 04:28:19,440
Okay, she must have rolled her eyes when I gave her her name.

4901
04:28:19,440 --> 04:28:21,440
She's like, you can't go on any more stereo, typical friend.

4902
04:28:21,440 --> 04:28:23,440
Yes!

4903
04:28:23,440 --> 04:28:26,440
How do you? Right next,

4904
04:28:26,440 --> 04:28:29,440
the poppin' piece, the link into the

4905
04:28:29,440 --> 04:28:34,440
stereo, the URL, go.

4906
04:28:34,440 --> 04:28:36,440
Okay, we're good.

4907
04:28:36,440 --> 04:28:38,440
Oh shit, it started right away.

4908
04:28:38,440 --> 04:28:41,440
Okay, cheeky waffle.

4909
04:28:41,440 --> 04:28:43,440
Is it the candy stream?

4910
04:28:43,440 --> 04:28:45,440
Yes, the one with her cats.

4911
04:28:45,440 --> 04:28:47,440
Eh, her cats, her rats came out.

4912
04:28:47,440 --> 04:28:50,440
She doesn't have cats, she has rats.

4913
04:28:56,440 --> 04:28:58,440
Wait, love in my autogest stop.

4914
04:28:58,440 --> 04:28:59,440
Who named her?

4915
04:28:59,440 --> 04:29:01,440
Honestly, that's outrageous.

4916
04:29:01,440 --> 04:29:03,440
Don't forget to update the pinned message.

4917
04:29:03,440 --> 04:29:06,440
Wow, that's all I was not going to.

4918
04:29:06,440 --> 04:29:07,440
One...

4919
04:29:07,440 --> 04:29:09,440
One momento, por favor.

4920
04:29:09,440 --> 04:29:11,440
Okay.

4921
04:29:12,440 --> 04:29:15,440
I can't type in my own chat.

4922
04:29:15,440 --> 04:29:17,440
I said subscriber only mode.

4923
04:29:17,440 --> 04:29:19,440
I can't type in my own chat.

4924
04:29:19,440 --> 04:29:20,440
Fuck.

4925
04:29:20,440 --> 04:29:21,440
What?

4926
04:29:21,440 --> 04:29:22,440
Hold on, let me refresh.

4927
04:29:22,440 --> 04:29:24,440
That can't be right.

4928
04:29:24,440 --> 04:29:26,440
And won't let me type.

4929
04:29:26,440 --> 04:29:28,440
I just...

4930
04:29:28,440 --> 04:29:30,440
I've been kicked out of my YouTube account!

4931
04:29:30,440 --> 04:29:33,440
Oh my god, did I have my password?

4932
04:29:33,440 --> 04:29:35,440
Oh, for pissing sake.

4933
04:29:35,440 --> 04:29:37,440
I've got kicked out of my YouTube account.

4934
04:29:37,440 --> 04:29:39,440
Bro, I better still be live though.

4935
04:29:39,440 --> 04:29:41,440
Hold on.

4936
04:29:41,440 --> 04:29:43,440
Hold on, let me just say a little...

4937
04:29:43,440 --> 04:29:45,440
I need to change on time.

4938
04:29:45,440 --> 04:29:48,440
YouTube literally kicked me out all the fucking time.

4939
04:29:49,440 --> 04:29:52,440
Um...

4940
04:29:52,440 --> 04:29:57,440
YouTube password.

4941
04:29:57,440 --> 04:30:00,440
I don't know why YouTube has such issues with me.

4942
04:30:00,440 --> 04:30:01,440
Just being Chinese.

4943
04:30:01,440 --> 04:30:02,440
Don't you laugh.

4944
04:30:02,440 --> 04:30:04,440
Being Chinese.

4945
04:30:04,440 --> 04:30:07,440
It fucking like despises me.

4946
04:30:07,440 --> 04:30:08,440
I don't know why.

4947
04:30:08,440 --> 04:30:10,440
I don't do anything to it.

4948
04:30:11,440 --> 04:30:13,440
I don't know.

4949
04:30:14,440 --> 04:30:17,440
I'm getting a bit ridiculous.

4950
04:30:17,440 --> 04:30:19,440
It was funny the first few times you kicked me out,

4951
04:30:19,440 --> 04:30:21,440
but I have to admit.

4952
04:30:21,440 --> 04:30:23,440
I don't know.

4953
04:30:45,440 --> 04:30:47,440
I love when YouTube hits me.

4954
04:30:47,440 --> 04:30:49,440
All of this because I want to watch an Emmy stream.

4955
04:30:50,440 --> 04:30:52,440
My oppressors are working.

4956
04:30:52,440 --> 04:30:54,440
Clearly, they're working overtime to hit the fuck.

4957
04:30:54,440 --> 04:30:56,440
Okay, I'm in! I'm in! I'm in! I'm in!

4958
04:30:56,440 --> 04:30:57,440
Okay, right.

4959
04:30:57,440 --> 04:31:00,440
We're in World 380.

4960
04:31:00,440 --> 04:31:02,440
We're edging.

4961
04:31:02,440 --> 04:31:04,440
In Edgeville.

4962
04:31:04,440 --> 04:31:08,440
And we're watching.

4963
04:31:08,440 --> 04:31:11,440
And then get the link to the video.

4964
04:31:11,440 --> 04:31:13,440
I'll see.

4965
04:31:13,440 --> 04:31:15,440
See.

4966
04:31:15,440 --> 04:31:17,440
And then...

4967
04:31:17,440 --> 04:31:19,440
Kissing my...

4968
04:31:21,440 --> 04:31:22,440
No.

4969
04:31:22,440 --> 04:31:23,440
No, wait.

4970
04:31:23,440 --> 04:31:24,440
What the fuck is this?

4971
04:31:24,440 --> 04:31:27,440
World 380.

4972
04:31:27,440 --> 04:31:28,440
Yeah.

4973
04:31:28,440 --> 04:31:29,440
Let me send.

4974
04:31:29,440 --> 04:31:30,440
And then watching.

4975
04:31:30,440 --> 04:31:31,440
Look at that book.

4976
04:31:31,440 --> 04:31:34,440
God, that was like way harder than it had to be.

4977
04:31:34,440 --> 04:31:35,440
Ten.

4978
04:31:38,440 --> 04:31:39,440
Watching an Emmy.

4979
04:31:39,440 --> 04:31:40,440
Okay.

4980
04:31:41,440 --> 04:31:43,440
We got there in the end.

4981
04:31:44,440 --> 04:31:47,440
Are we ready?

4982
04:31:47,440 --> 04:31:49,440
Replaying.

4983
04:31:49,440 --> 04:31:52,440
Do you have your little sister on screen?

4984
04:31:52,440 --> 04:31:54,440
Also, I have a blueberry muffin.

4985
04:31:54,440 --> 04:31:57,440
It's really imperative that you know I have a blueberry muffin.

4986
04:31:57,440 --> 04:31:59,440
Just so you should know.

4987
04:31:59,440 --> 04:32:02,440
It's imperative information.

4988
04:32:02,440 --> 04:32:04,440
I have a blueberry muffin.

4989
04:32:04,440 --> 04:32:06,440
I should be back on my PC and things.

4990
04:32:06,440 --> 04:32:08,440
Okay, we're ready.

4991
04:32:08,440 --> 04:32:10,440
On 3, 2, 1, go.

4992
04:32:10,440 --> 04:32:11,440
Ready.

4993
04:32:11,440 --> 04:32:13,440
3, 2, 1, go.

4994
04:32:15,440 --> 04:32:18,440
Oh, who cooked on this?

4995
04:32:18,440 --> 04:32:23,440
What an amazing background music.

4996
04:32:23,440 --> 04:32:24,440
Truly cooking.

4997
04:32:24,440 --> 04:32:25,440
Aren't you two seconds in?

4998
04:32:25,440 --> 04:32:27,440
Oh shit, maybe two seconds ahead.

4999
04:32:29,440 --> 04:32:32,440
You'll have to go ahead and then pause and then meet me.

5000
04:32:42,440 --> 04:32:50,440
It's so good.

5001
04:32:50,440 --> 04:32:51,440
It's my favourite.

5002
04:32:51,440 --> 04:32:53,440
Sorry, it's literally my favourite background music.

5003
04:32:55,440 --> 04:32:59,440
I don't know what to make Unconfirmed Gen 2's background based on.

5004
04:32:59,440 --> 04:33:01,440
I might do Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.

5005
04:33:01,440 --> 04:33:02,440
I'm not sure yet.

5006
04:33:03,440 --> 04:33:05,440
I might listen to the OSP.

5007
04:33:12,440 --> 04:33:15,440
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

5008
04:33:15,440 --> 04:33:18,440
I wouldn't say him Heimcastle.

5009
04:33:18,440 --> 04:33:19,440
Super Mario.

5010
04:33:19,440 --> 04:33:21,440
I've never played that.

5011
04:33:23,440 --> 04:33:26,440
One day I might have a waiting screen to do.

5012
04:33:26,440 --> 04:33:27,440
Not our day.

5013
04:33:27,440 --> 04:33:30,440
I'm eating gems.

5014
04:33:31,440 --> 04:33:33,440
Mmm, mmm.

5015
04:33:34,440 --> 04:33:37,440
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

5016
04:33:38,440 --> 04:33:40,440
I'm eating little gems.

5017
04:33:42,440 --> 04:33:44,440
Munch in and dance them.

5018
04:33:44,440 --> 04:33:47,440
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

5019
04:33:54,440 --> 04:33:55,440
She's giggling.

5020
04:33:55,440 --> 04:33:57,440
She's always in that.

5021
04:34:03,440 --> 04:34:04,440
I don't know what game.

5022
04:34:04,440 --> 04:34:05,440
What childhood game?

5023
04:34:07,440 --> 04:34:09,440
Base them off a halo.

5024
04:34:15,440 --> 04:34:18,440
It's cute when girls dance and eat at the same time.

5025
04:34:18,440 --> 04:34:19,440
I'll be inhaling the ship.

5026
04:34:19,440 --> 04:34:22,440
Although I'm worried I'm going to burn my mouth on the chicken though.

5027
04:34:22,440 --> 04:34:24,440
I promise you my chicken is hard.

5028
04:34:24,440 --> 04:34:28,440
I solemnly swear the poultry is erect.

5029
04:34:28,440 --> 04:34:29,440
Amen.

5030
04:34:30,440 --> 04:34:31,440
Minish Cap.

5031
04:34:31,440 --> 04:34:33,440
Yeah, I thought about Minish Cap.

5032
04:34:33,440 --> 04:34:35,440
I'm going to have to listen to the OSP on Minish Cap.

5033
04:34:36,440 --> 04:34:39,440
Well, it might be a bit hard.

5034
04:34:45,440 --> 04:34:50,440
Sonic Heroes had a very diverse soundtrack,

5035
04:34:50,440 --> 04:34:53,440
which is why it was like a no-brainer

5036
04:34:53,440 --> 04:34:56,440
when I was pregnant with Gen 1.

5037
04:34:57,440 --> 04:34:59,440
But how hard was it?

5038
04:34:59,440 --> 04:35:01,440
Oh, it's so hard.

5039
04:35:02,440 --> 04:35:03,440
Hmm.

5040
04:35:05,440 --> 04:35:07,440
Oh, my sister's on.

5041
04:35:08,440 --> 04:35:09,440
Amy!

5042
04:35:10,440 --> 04:35:11,440
Hi.

5043
04:35:14,440 --> 04:35:15,440
It's her behind.

5044
04:35:20,440 --> 04:35:22,440
It sounds fine to me.

5045
04:35:27,440 --> 04:35:29,440
We have to cook, Amy.

5046
04:35:29,440 --> 04:35:31,440
We're already a reference to...

5047
04:35:32,440 --> 04:35:33,440
Wopa.

5048
04:35:34,440 --> 04:35:35,440
Is it tasty? It's delicious.

5049
04:35:35,440 --> 04:35:38,440
Gen 2 All Goth and background music is doom.

5050
04:35:44,440 --> 04:35:47,440
I hope Minish Cap has some diverse soundtracks,

5051
04:35:47,440 --> 04:35:49,440
but I can't remember.

5052
04:35:49,440 --> 04:35:50,440
Maybe Pokemon?

5053
04:35:50,440 --> 04:35:52,440
Maybe Pokemon Ruby?

5054
04:35:53,440 --> 04:35:54,440
Possibly.

5055
04:35:55,440 --> 04:35:58,440
Possibly Gen 3 Pokemon Inspiration.

5056
04:35:58,440 --> 04:36:00,440
That's plausible.

5057
04:36:02,440 --> 04:36:06,440
Cameo has some diverse soundtracks as well.

5058
04:36:07,440 --> 04:36:09,440
I don't know about Conker's Bad Friday.

5059
04:36:13,440 --> 04:36:15,440
Is that the real Amy Bezu from Generation V?

5060
04:36:20,440 --> 04:36:21,440
My poor Amy.

5061
04:36:21,440 --> 04:36:23,440
A message there about the cough,

5062
04:36:23,440 --> 04:36:25,440
and she was like,

5063
04:36:25,440 --> 04:36:27,440
it is what it is, and I said,

5064
04:36:27,440 --> 04:36:30,440
well, you don't have to do what you have to do,

5065
04:36:30,440 --> 04:36:32,440
you know what I mean?

5066
04:36:36,440 --> 04:36:37,440
Oh, she's on the floor!

5067
04:36:37,440 --> 04:36:39,440
Oh, my gosh, she's on the floor for the pentals.

5068
04:36:39,440 --> 04:36:41,440
Butter and Forte.

5069
04:36:42,440 --> 04:36:44,440
Are you a Sonic fan? Yay, Sonic Heroes!

5070
04:36:49,440 --> 04:36:52,440
Mega Man? I've never played Mega Man.

5071
04:36:53,440 --> 04:36:55,440
I'm trying to be selfish

5072
04:36:55,440 --> 04:36:58,440
and make it up about video games that I've played.

5073
04:36:58,440 --> 04:37:00,440
Oh, God, the Gen 3 Trumpets?

5074
04:37:00,440 --> 04:37:01,440
What?

5075
04:37:01,440 --> 04:37:02,440
Oh, the Gen 3...

5076
04:37:02,440 --> 04:37:03,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5077
04:37:03,440 --> 04:37:05,440
Pokemon, the Gen 3, literally.

5078
04:37:06,440 --> 04:37:07,440
It's so good.

5079
04:37:11,440 --> 04:37:12,440
Sonic Unleash.

5080
04:37:13,440 --> 04:37:15,440
Because it's already been based on Sonic,

5081
04:37:15,440 --> 04:37:18,440
I wouldn't go back to Sonic Influence for the background music.

5082
04:37:23,440 --> 04:37:24,440
Aw.

5083
04:37:26,440 --> 04:37:27,440
He got wee plasters

5084
04:37:27,440 --> 04:37:30,440
because she cannae stop picking her wee scabs up.

5085
04:37:32,440 --> 04:37:33,440
Aw.

5086
04:37:34,440 --> 04:37:36,440
And she painted her nails black as well

5087
04:37:36,440 --> 04:37:38,440
to be more accurate.

5088
04:37:38,440 --> 04:37:39,440
What a legend, honestly.

5089
04:37:40,440 --> 04:37:42,440
See these wee details that the girls do,

5090
04:37:42,440 --> 04:37:45,440
like, I don't even request none of this.

5091
04:37:46,440 --> 04:37:48,440
It's just, I'm doing, in real life stream,

5092
04:37:48,440 --> 04:37:50,440
okay, here's some of your schedule,

5093
04:37:50,440 --> 04:37:52,440
and they go above and beyond.

5094
04:37:52,440 --> 04:37:55,440
Mercy got matching nail polish

5095
04:37:55,440 --> 04:37:57,440
to band-aids and that.

5096
04:37:57,440 --> 04:37:59,440
The girls put so much effort into it.

5097
04:37:59,440 --> 04:38:01,440
They're so fantastic.

5098
04:38:08,440 --> 04:38:10,440
The pixel was on.

5099
04:38:10,440 --> 04:38:12,440
What are those?

5100
04:38:12,440 --> 04:38:14,440
I've never played Mega Man?

5101
04:38:14,440 --> 04:38:15,440
Mega Man?

5102
04:38:20,440 --> 04:38:21,440
GTA?

5103
04:38:25,440 --> 04:38:28,440
It has to be, like, nostalgic for me,

5104
04:38:28,440 --> 04:38:31,440
which limits the list so, so tiny.

5105
04:38:35,440 --> 04:38:36,440
Radiation?

5106
04:38:36,440 --> 04:38:38,440
Who said that?

5107
04:38:39,440 --> 04:38:40,440
Mint Pier?

5108
04:38:43,440 --> 04:38:44,440
Temple of Droplets?

5109
04:38:45,440 --> 04:38:48,440
I'll take a look into Pokémon

5110
04:38:48,440 --> 04:38:51,440
and Legend of Zelda Minish Cap.

5111
04:38:51,440 --> 04:38:53,440
Those are mostly, I'm gonna be honest with you,

5112
04:38:53,440 --> 04:38:54,440
I'm gonna see.

5113
04:38:56,440 --> 04:38:58,440
Sorry, I have food in my mouth,

5114
04:38:58,440 --> 04:39:00,440
like, so I can't see properly.

5115
04:39:04,440 --> 04:39:05,440
Hold on.

5116
04:39:06,440 --> 04:39:08,440
Hold on, and you go turn off the heat

5117
04:39:08,440 --> 04:39:10,440
and I'm getting cooked alive in here.

5118
04:39:10,440 --> 04:39:12,440
I'm so sorry, I had food in my mouth

5119
04:39:12,440 --> 04:39:14,440
so I couldn't see, I just had to,

5120
04:39:14,440 --> 04:39:16,440
I just had to fucking go,

5121
04:39:24,440 --> 04:39:26,440
I still feel it in my nose though.

5122
04:39:28,440 --> 04:39:29,440
Oh, sorry.

5123
04:39:31,440 --> 04:39:32,440
It's very unpleasant.

5124
04:39:32,440 --> 04:39:34,440
Rather unpleasant than trying to,

5125
04:39:34,440 --> 04:39:36,440
oh, she's going BRB already?

5126
04:39:37,440 --> 04:39:39,440
She's gonna try and fix the camera?

5127
04:39:39,440 --> 04:39:40,440
It's no big deal.

5128
04:39:43,440 --> 04:39:46,440
Colofish, more like, I sounded like a goose?

5129
04:39:47,440 --> 04:39:49,440
I thought it sounded more like a race car.

5130
04:40:01,440 --> 04:40:03,440
Hold on, can you get a drink of water?

5131
04:40:03,440 --> 04:40:04,440
It feels like,

5132
04:40:05,440 --> 04:40:07,440
like there's food at the back of my nose

5133
04:40:07,440 --> 04:40:09,440
that I can't, like, yeah.

5134
04:40:09,440 --> 04:40:11,440
I don't know if that makes any sense.

5135
04:40:23,440 --> 04:40:25,440
The peach, she's so cute.

5136
04:40:25,440 --> 04:40:28,440
Sheavey wanted that asset as well, actually.

5137
04:40:33,440 --> 04:40:34,440
I don't know.

5138
04:40:48,440 --> 04:40:49,440
I just remembered,

5139
04:40:49,440 --> 04:40:51,440
I bought Mercy artwork for a song cover.

5140
04:40:53,440 --> 04:40:55,440
I need to bother her about that.

5141
04:40:57,440 --> 04:40:58,440
And she put it on the back burner,

5142
04:40:58,440 --> 04:41:00,440
I can't remember why we paused it up.

5143
04:41:04,440 --> 04:41:06,440
I said it's what, when?

5144
04:41:06,440 --> 04:41:09,440
What, you mean like, April Fools?

5145
04:41:16,440 --> 04:41:18,440
What are you eating today, Reef Lim?

5146
04:41:19,440 --> 04:41:21,440
I got my chicken tendies.

5147
04:41:22,440 --> 04:41:25,440
I feed you my chicken tendies and my gems.

5148
04:41:26,440 --> 04:41:29,440
Or tater tots, as you guys call it, tater tots.

5149
04:41:30,440 --> 04:41:32,440
Let me get some tater tots.

5150
04:41:33,440 --> 04:41:35,440
And some rib eye steak.

5151
04:41:35,440 --> 04:41:37,440
And I'll take the,

5152
04:41:39,440 --> 04:41:42,440
the col, the slaw, I'll take the slaw.

5153
04:41:42,440 --> 04:41:43,440
Where else?

5154
04:41:44,440 --> 04:41:46,440
Do you stereotypically eat?

5155
04:41:46,440 --> 04:41:48,440
Oh, and the cornbread, I'll say I have cornbread.

5156
04:41:48,440 --> 04:41:50,440
I've never had cornbread in my life.

5157
04:41:52,440 --> 04:41:54,440
They're called gems.

5158
04:41:54,440 --> 04:41:55,440
Yep.

5159
04:41:55,440 --> 04:41:58,440
Tater tots are called gems.

5160
04:41:59,440 --> 04:42:01,440
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

5161
04:42:02,440 --> 04:42:05,440
Cornbread is so blue. Cornbread is fucking delicious.

5162
04:42:05,440 --> 04:42:07,440
Okay, we have two opposing opinions.

5163
04:42:10,440 --> 04:42:12,440
You're gonna eat your cornbread.

5164
04:42:12,440 --> 04:42:14,440
Also, no one eats tater tots with steak.

5165
04:42:14,440 --> 04:42:15,440
Steak are like high class.

5166
04:42:15,440 --> 04:42:17,440
Oh, I have steak and gems.

5167
04:42:19,440 --> 04:42:21,440
My dad actually wasn't happy.

5168
04:42:21,440 --> 04:42:25,440
I had steak and tater tots or gems.

5169
04:42:25,440 --> 04:42:28,440
And he was, like, having it in a fried egg.

5170
04:42:28,440 --> 04:42:30,440
And he was, like, strutty.

5171
04:42:30,440 --> 04:42:31,440
And I'm like, whoa!

5172
04:42:31,440 --> 04:42:33,440
How do I like to eat it?

5173
04:42:33,440 --> 04:42:35,440
I just mash it all together. It's nice.

5174
04:42:35,440 --> 04:42:39,440
I'll actually starch and then meat protein and all that jazz.

5175
04:42:39,440 --> 04:42:40,440
Iron.

5176
04:42:43,440 --> 04:42:45,440
I'm enjoying the fuck out of this food.

5177
04:42:46,440 --> 04:42:47,440
I literally never ate anything.

5178
04:42:47,440 --> 04:42:49,440
It's been five hours since I woke up.

5179
04:42:49,440 --> 04:42:51,440
And I don't, like, eat before bed or anything like that.

5180
04:42:51,440 --> 04:42:53,440
I know some people have a midnight snack,

5181
04:42:53,440 --> 04:42:55,440
which is quite, quite Kauai-ne.

5182
04:42:55,440 --> 04:42:57,440
Okay, I might need to drink my tea.

5183
04:42:57,440 --> 04:43:01,440
I'm using this teacup that's fricking rubbish for retaining heat,

5184
04:43:01,440 --> 04:43:03,440
so it gets cold so quick.

5185
04:43:05,440 --> 04:43:07,440
Well, it's already cold, so there you go.

5186
04:43:09,440 --> 04:43:12,440
While we're at it at Star Wars, what about candy corn?

5187
04:43:12,440 --> 04:43:14,440
I've never tried it.

5188
04:43:15,440 --> 04:43:18,440
Is it actually a piece of corn that's got sugar on it?

5189
04:43:18,440 --> 04:43:21,440
Or is it, like, a replica of food that's to look like corn?

5190
04:43:22,440 --> 04:43:24,440
And, like, that's where its name is?

5191
04:43:24,440 --> 04:43:26,440
Or is it just, like, all sugar?

5192
04:43:26,440 --> 04:43:27,440
Is it, like, a sugar cube?

5193
04:43:27,440 --> 04:43:29,440
Candy corn is shite?

5194
04:43:29,440 --> 04:43:30,440
Take a early bit. No.

5195
04:43:30,440 --> 04:43:32,440
It's all just sugar.

5196
04:43:32,440 --> 04:43:33,440
That's a good crime.

5197
04:43:33,440 --> 04:43:35,440
Does anyone like candy corn?

5198
04:43:35,440 --> 04:43:37,440
It tastes like plastic.

5199
04:43:37,440 --> 04:43:39,440
Oh, is it, like, ultra-processed?

5200
04:43:39,440 --> 04:43:41,440
Like, the Twizzlers?

5201
04:43:41,440 --> 04:43:44,440
I think it was a Twizzler I tried.

5202
04:43:44,440 --> 04:43:46,440
Like, that red stick.

5203
04:43:47,440 --> 04:43:49,440
There is nothing to...

5204
04:43:49,440 --> 04:43:52,440
It's a replica. It's pure sugar and corn syrup in the shape of corn.

5205
04:43:53,440 --> 04:43:55,440
When we took the corn,

5206
04:43:55,440 --> 04:43:58,440
took the sugary, fructose-high percentage,

5207
04:43:58,440 --> 04:44:01,440
shoved it back in the sun and it looked like corn.

5208
04:44:03,440 --> 04:44:05,440
Candy corn's gross.

5209
04:44:13,440 --> 04:44:15,440
Just even like, I love candy corn.

5210
04:44:15,440 --> 04:44:17,440
You're against the grain.

5211
04:44:17,440 --> 04:44:19,440
Get back from work.

5212
04:44:19,440 --> 04:44:23,440
Make sure to hydrate and take your 30-minute push-work-shit-refling.

5213
04:44:26,440 --> 04:44:28,440
Yeah, you need to get out of your system.

5214
04:44:28,440 --> 04:44:32,440
Unless you bombed the toilets at your workplace and that's different.

5215
04:44:32,440 --> 04:44:34,440
Then that just proves what a chad you are,

5216
04:44:34,440 --> 04:44:36,440
your biological warfare at the workplace.

5217
04:44:40,440 --> 04:44:42,440
What about peeps?

5218
04:44:42,440 --> 04:44:44,440
I got to try the blue peeps.

5219
04:44:45,440 --> 04:44:47,440
I was scared to swallow it.

5220
04:44:47,440 --> 04:44:50,440
No, obviously I'm overreacting,

5221
04:44:50,440 --> 04:44:54,440
but it actually was like, made me scared to swallow it.

5222
04:45:01,440 --> 04:45:03,440
Isn't shitting on company-time mail?

5223
04:45:03,440 --> 04:45:05,440
Oh, it should be.

5224
04:45:05,440 --> 04:45:08,440
Why do you think the girls take idle meetings midstream, huh?

5225
04:45:10,440 --> 04:45:13,440
Boss makes a dollar, I'll make a dime.

5226
04:45:13,440 --> 04:45:16,440
That's why shitting on company-time.

5227
04:45:19,440 --> 04:45:21,440
Why were you scared to swallow the peep?

5228
04:45:21,440 --> 04:45:22,440
I don't know.

5229
04:45:22,440 --> 04:45:27,440
It was just like, my brain was like, this is not edible.

5230
04:45:28,440 --> 04:45:31,440
The texture, the flavor.

5231
04:45:31,440 --> 04:45:35,440
My brain manually overreads my ability to swallow them.

5232
04:45:35,440 --> 04:45:39,440
It was like, this is not good to go.

5233
04:45:39,440 --> 04:45:43,440
So, I trusted my brain and spat it out on that stream.

5234
04:45:43,440 --> 04:45:47,440
And I've still got a bone to pick with a waterpatch,

5235
04:45:47,440 --> 04:45:50,440
was it waterpatch melon candy or something?

5236
04:45:50,440 --> 04:45:52,440
Oh wait, what am I trying to say?

5237
04:45:52,440 --> 04:45:55,440
Watermelon candypatch kids, shit.

5238
04:45:55,440 --> 04:45:57,440
Something like that.

5239
04:46:00,440 --> 04:46:02,440
Silverpatch kids?

5240
04:46:02,440 --> 04:46:04,440
Was it silverpatch watermelon?

5241
04:46:04,440 --> 04:46:06,440
Aye, I've still got a bone to pick with that.

5242
04:46:06,440 --> 04:46:08,440
Where's the flavor go?

5243
04:46:08,440 --> 04:46:10,440
Nothing disappeared, literally.

5244
04:46:10,440 --> 04:46:12,440
They literally was gone.

5245
04:46:12,440 --> 04:46:14,440
I was like, oh.

5246
04:46:19,440 --> 04:46:21,440
Oh, itadakimasu!

5247
04:46:39,440 --> 04:46:44,440
Why would you not just eat regular?

5248
04:46:44,440 --> 04:46:48,440
I was in this foreign sweet shop and I just picked whatever.

5249
04:46:48,440 --> 04:46:51,440
And I'm like, oh, Americans always go on about candy.

5250
04:46:51,440 --> 04:46:54,440
Watermelon, I'm like, oh fuck it, I'll get that flavor.

5251
04:46:56,440 --> 04:46:57,440
Good call.

5252
04:46:57,440 --> 04:46:59,440
A lot of candy in the US is an edible proof.

5253
04:46:59,440 --> 04:47:03,440
Hershey's chocolate is made with something that makes the chocolate taste like vomit.

5254
04:47:04,440 --> 04:47:05,440
Why?

5255
04:47:05,440 --> 04:47:07,440
But why?

5256
04:47:07,440 --> 04:47:10,440
I'm not even questioning, I actually think that's true.

5257
04:47:10,440 --> 04:47:11,440
But why?

5258
04:47:11,440 --> 04:47:15,440
Is it to cheapen the fucking value?

5259
04:47:17,440 --> 04:47:19,440
The flavor is the silver part.

5260
04:47:19,440 --> 04:47:22,440
That's the powder coating that dissolves very quickly.

5261
04:47:22,440 --> 04:47:25,440
Yeah, literally it's gone.

5262
04:47:25,440 --> 04:47:28,440
When I was kid, I had a gummy shark.

5263
04:47:28,440 --> 04:47:32,440
I kept away because I thought it was a friend but I was forced to throw it away.

5264
04:47:33,440 --> 04:47:36,440
Like an actual shark?

5265
04:47:37,440 --> 04:47:39,440
You found one?

5266
04:47:39,440 --> 04:47:41,440
Or am I being dumb?

5267
04:47:41,440 --> 04:47:45,440
It has a chemical that is produced in vomit but not everyone can taste it.

5268
04:47:45,440 --> 04:47:47,440
Hershey's taste doesn't like vomit.

5269
04:47:47,440 --> 04:47:50,440
Keep that shelf life higher.

5270
04:47:56,440 --> 04:48:00,440
They got to limit the supply to make it look like it's a salt after thing.

5271
04:48:00,440 --> 04:48:03,440
When reality is, they could just ship more of it.

5272
04:48:04,440 --> 04:48:07,440
I never really understood the chocolate alias though.

5273
04:48:07,440 --> 04:48:12,440
In Europe, it's a higher sugar and milk content, I think.

5274
04:48:12,440 --> 04:48:16,440
And then, it's better, American, I don't know.

5275
04:48:18,440 --> 04:48:20,440
Fucking hell, Amy, come on.

5276
04:48:20,440 --> 04:48:22,440
Poor Amy, actually, you know what it is?

5277
04:48:22,440 --> 04:48:28,440
She's a perfectionist and she doesn't want the camera bugging out, but it is.

5278
04:48:28,440 --> 04:48:30,440
And it's upset her, which is a shame.

5279
04:48:30,440 --> 04:48:31,440
I hope she's okay.

5280
04:48:31,440 --> 04:48:33,440
She is a bit of a perfectionist.

5281
04:48:33,440 --> 04:48:35,440
I hope it doesn't stress her out too much, honestly.

5282
04:48:51,440 --> 04:48:56,440
I was in another country last month and the Dr Pepper there wasn't made with corn syrup

5283
04:48:56,440 --> 04:48:58,440
and were significantly better.

5284
04:48:58,440 --> 04:49:02,440
I can find it myself to forgive you for giving it a seat here.

5285
04:49:02,440 --> 04:49:06,440
You are forgiven, dear Reefling, you understand now.

5286
04:49:06,440 --> 04:49:13,440
So there's this drink called Orange Gina in the UK and Europe and it's absolutely gorgeous.

5287
04:49:13,440 --> 04:49:19,440
But the best country I've ever tasted it in is in France, Orange Gina, France.

5288
04:49:19,440 --> 04:49:21,440
It's just so good.

5289
04:49:21,440 --> 04:49:23,440
So, so good.

5290
04:49:28,440 --> 04:49:30,440
Mm-hmm.

5291
04:49:34,440 --> 04:49:36,440
It's good. Almost finished eating.

5292
04:49:36,440 --> 04:49:38,440
Almost.

5293
04:49:38,440 --> 04:49:40,440
Mexican Coca-Cola is really sweet and good.

5294
04:49:40,440 --> 04:49:42,440
I've always wanted to try it.

5295
04:49:42,440 --> 04:49:44,440
They say the Mexican Cola is the best.

5296
04:49:44,440 --> 04:49:46,440
Mm-hmm.

5297
04:49:53,440 --> 04:49:55,440
Wait.

5298
04:49:55,440 --> 04:49:56,440
Is what?

5299
04:49:56,440 --> 04:49:59,440
The Orange Gina is marketed to French furries?

5300
04:49:59,440 --> 04:50:02,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, two voodoo leon.

5301
04:50:02,440 --> 04:50:04,440
Bark, bark.

5302
04:50:04,440 --> 04:50:07,440
And, you know, I've forgotten all my French.

5303
04:50:07,440 --> 04:50:09,440
I cannot string a sentence together for the life of me.

5304
04:50:09,440 --> 04:50:12,440
Like, how do you advertise to French furries?

5305
04:50:12,440 --> 04:50:14,440
Bark, or what?

5306
04:50:14,440 --> 04:50:16,440
Mm-hmm.

5307
04:50:20,440 --> 04:50:22,440
En chien.

5308
04:50:22,440 --> 04:50:24,440
Et tu en chien?

5309
04:50:24,440 --> 04:50:26,440
Drink Orange Gina then.

5310
04:50:26,440 --> 04:50:28,440
Are you a dog?

5311
04:50:28,440 --> 04:50:30,440
Chien?

5312
04:50:30,440 --> 04:50:32,440
Mm-hmm.

5313
04:50:32,440 --> 04:50:34,440
The Mexican Coca-Cola is good.

5314
04:50:36,440 --> 04:50:38,440
I can't remember if I've ever gotten to try Orange Gina.

5315
04:50:38,440 --> 04:50:41,440
I don't know if it's elsewhere but it is in Europe.

5316
04:50:41,440 --> 04:50:44,440
I've had it in France, I've had it in the UK.

5317
04:50:44,440 --> 04:50:47,440
And I remember asking my dad, I was like,

5318
04:50:47,440 --> 04:50:51,440
why does the British version not taste as good as the French version?

5319
04:50:51,440 --> 04:50:55,440
And he was like, he had to explain to me that different products

5320
04:50:55,440 --> 04:50:58,440
are in different countries under the same brand,

5321
04:50:58,440 --> 04:51:01,440
but other countries will have better quality and all that.

5322
04:51:01,440 --> 04:51:04,440
And the UK's food quality is going down every year type thing

5323
04:51:04,440 --> 04:51:07,440
compared to the rest of Europe basically.

5324
04:51:07,440 --> 04:51:10,440
So that was, you know, fun to learn.

5325
04:51:12,440 --> 04:51:15,440
Ooh, we're almost 19,000.

5326
04:51:15,440 --> 04:51:17,440
We're getting close.

5327
04:51:17,440 --> 04:51:20,440
We're getting so close.

5328
04:51:26,440 --> 04:51:28,440
Oh wait.

5329
04:51:28,440 --> 04:51:31,440
I have curiosity since Amy's still getting the rats ready.

5330
04:51:31,440 --> 04:51:33,440
And...

5331
04:51:33,440 --> 04:51:35,440
French?

5332
04:51:35,440 --> 04:51:37,440
No!

5333
04:51:37,440 --> 04:51:39,440
Oh, is she back?

5334
04:51:39,440 --> 04:51:41,440
Is she back?

5335
04:51:41,440 --> 04:51:43,440
French? Orange Gina?

5336
04:51:43,440 --> 04:51:45,440
Oh shit, she's back. Okay, bad timing.

5337
04:51:45,440 --> 04:51:47,440
Put the board on! Look at the board!

5338
04:51:47,440 --> 04:51:49,440
Forget the French furries!

5339
04:51:49,440 --> 04:51:51,440
Abort! Abort!

5340
04:51:51,440 --> 04:51:53,440
Okay.

5341
04:51:55,440 --> 04:51:57,440
Well that's, okay, I see her.

5342
04:52:03,440 --> 04:52:05,440
Okay.

5343
04:52:09,440 --> 04:52:11,440
Okay.

5344
04:52:19,440 --> 04:52:21,440
Is she okay?

5345
04:52:29,440 --> 04:52:31,440
She's back.

5346
04:52:31,440 --> 04:52:33,440
What time are we on the board?

5347
04:52:33,440 --> 04:52:35,440
In the top left corner

5348
04:52:35,440 --> 04:52:37,440
has the ongoing time stamp

5349
04:52:37,440 --> 04:52:39,440
of like what, where I am at.

5350
04:52:39,440 --> 04:52:41,440
And you can go ahead a few seconds

5351
04:52:41,440 --> 04:52:43,440
to match up to me and pause and play

5352
04:52:43,440 --> 04:52:45,440
like when I'm on that second.

5353
04:52:52,440 --> 04:52:54,440
I'm now going to eat a blueberry muffin

5354
04:52:54,440 --> 04:52:57,440
as my sweet treat after eating savoury food.

5355
04:52:57,440 --> 04:52:59,440
Love being British.

5356
04:52:59,440 --> 04:53:02,440
Looking nothing better than having a sweet treat

5357
04:53:02,440 --> 04:53:04,440
after a savoury meal.

5358
04:53:05,440 --> 04:53:07,440
Oh, there's her!

5359
04:53:09,440 --> 04:53:11,440
That's so cute!

5360
04:53:18,440 --> 04:53:20,440
Oh, bless her.

5361
04:53:22,440 --> 04:53:24,440
Is that your favorite Sonic character?

5362
04:53:24,440 --> 04:53:26,440
Probably.

5363
04:53:26,440 --> 04:53:28,440
Amy or maybe Mr. Big?

5364
04:53:28,440 --> 04:53:30,440
I like Amy, Cream and Mr. Big together.

5365
04:53:30,440 --> 04:53:32,440
They're cute as fuck.

5366
04:53:33,440 --> 04:53:35,440
Oh, we, Amy, that actually sends Ray on par.

5367
04:53:35,440 --> 04:53:37,440
She's secretly a klutz.

5368
04:53:52,440 --> 04:53:55,440
Oh, that's how our rats were on the floor.

5369
04:53:55,440 --> 04:53:57,440
I was going to say, because wouldn't it be dangerous

5370
04:53:57,440 --> 04:53:59,440
for rats to be on a table? They might jump off.

5371
04:53:59,440 --> 04:54:02,440
It's fine, Amy, it's fine, we love you.

5372
04:54:05,440 --> 04:54:07,440
Cream just calls everyone Mr. and Mrs.

5373
04:54:07,440 --> 04:54:09,440
Oh.

5374
04:54:09,440 --> 04:54:11,440
Where's your pride at being a Scott?

5375
04:54:11,440 --> 04:54:13,440
Right, okay, sometimes, sometimes

5376
04:54:13,440 --> 04:54:15,440
British ain't being so bad, okay.

5377
04:54:15,440 --> 04:54:17,440
But I'm a Scott though, you know what I mean?

5378
04:54:17,440 --> 04:54:19,440
You know what I mean?

5379
04:54:19,440 --> 04:54:21,440
Like, I'm a Scott though, but you know, sometimes.

5380
04:54:21,440 --> 04:54:23,440
I mean, I spawned him with a British tea,

5381
04:54:23,440 --> 04:54:25,440
so fuck, that's what I've got to be thankful for.

5382
04:54:25,440 --> 04:54:27,440
What?

5383
04:54:35,440 --> 04:54:37,440
I have a plate Sonic Rush.

5384
04:54:37,440 --> 04:54:39,440
The Nintendo DS game?

5385
04:54:39,440 --> 04:54:41,440
I played the Nintendo DS game.

5386
04:54:43,440 --> 04:54:45,440
Oh my god, Amy does sound like that

5387
04:54:45,440 --> 04:54:47,440
1A smart creator, lividly, that does

5388
04:54:47,440 --> 04:54:49,440
yandere roleplays. That's crazy.

5389
04:54:49,440 --> 04:54:51,440
That's wild.

5390
04:54:56,440 --> 04:54:58,440
That's wild.

5391
04:54:59,440 --> 04:55:01,440
She sounds like a lighter pitched, lividly.

5392
04:55:01,440 --> 04:55:03,440
Bizarre, truly.

5393
04:55:14,440 --> 04:55:16,440
Maybe they're like sisters, probably.

5394
04:55:17,440 --> 04:55:19,440
How strange, truly.

5395
04:55:19,440 --> 04:55:21,440
Isn't British and Scottish the same?

5396
04:55:21,440 --> 04:55:23,440
Don't, don't you pipe up.

5397
04:55:23,440 --> 04:55:25,440
Only I'm allowed to make them jokes.

5398
04:55:25,440 --> 04:55:27,440
You're not allowed to pipe up like that.

5399
04:55:29,440 --> 04:55:31,440
Yeah, I must be some sort of poser

5400
04:55:31,440 --> 04:55:33,440
trying to like take Amy's clout or something.

5401
04:55:33,440 --> 04:55:35,440
That's bizarre.

5402
04:55:35,440 --> 04:55:37,440
You know, like when VTubers do that, trying...

5403
04:55:43,440 --> 04:55:45,440
I just want you to know that I'm dropping

5404
04:55:45,440 --> 04:55:47,440
blueberry muffin crumbs all over myself.

5405
04:55:47,440 --> 04:55:49,440
Yep.

5406
04:55:50,440 --> 04:55:52,440
You can lick them off if you're hungry

5407
04:55:52,440 --> 04:55:54,440
for a little snack.

5408
04:55:54,440 --> 04:55:56,440
That's disgusting.

5409
04:55:57,440 --> 04:55:59,440
It just comes out.

5410
04:56:01,440 --> 04:56:03,440
Can we have lividly, lividly at home?

5411
04:56:04,440 --> 04:56:06,440
Should I make that meme and give it to her?

5412
04:56:06,440 --> 04:56:08,440
Just be like, hey, do you want me...

5413
04:56:08,440 --> 04:56:10,440
There is a meme I was going to tweet at her,

5414
04:56:10,440 --> 04:56:12,440
but then I got too shy to do it.

5415
04:56:12,440 --> 04:56:14,440
I get shy around Amy, I'm just like,

5416
04:56:14,440 --> 04:56:16,440
oh god, I hope she doesn't find me too unprofessional.

5417
04:56:17,440 --> 04:56:19,440
But...

5418
04:56:19,440 --> 04:56:21,440
It's because Amy does her own thing,

5419
04:56:21,440 --> 04:56:23,440
like super does her own thing.

5420
04:56:24,440 --> 04:56:26,440
She never asks for help,

5421
04:56:26,440 --> 04:56:28,440
she never asks for

5422
04:56:28,440 --> 04:56:30,440
literally anything.

5423
04:56:30,440 --> 04:56:32,440
The one thing she's asked me for

5424
04:56:32,440 --> 04:56:34,440
was to do the collab script

5425
04:56:34,440 --> 04:56:36,440
on Icey's channel next.

5426
04:56:36,440 --> 04:56:38,440
That's the only thing she's asked me for,

5427
04:56:38,440 --> 04:56:40,440
so I get nervous. I'm like,

5428
04:56:40,440 --> 04:56:42,440
am I doing enough for you, my daughter?

5429
04:56:42,440 --> 04:56:44,440
Do you need more?

5430
04:56:45,440 --> 04:56:47,440
Yes!

5431
04:56:48,440 --> 04:56:50,440
Yes!

5432
04:56:51,440 --> 04:56:53,440
Yes!

5433
04:56:53,440 --> 04:56:55,440
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

5434
04:56:55,440 --> 04:56:57,440
Let's see your babies.

5435
04:56:59,440 --> 04:57:01,440
Halfway through 95, not bad, not bad.

5436
04:57:10,440 --> 04:57:12,440
She's a strong independent little sister,

5437
04:57:12,440 --> 04:57:14,440
so I don't need no nanny.

5438
04:57:14,440 --> 04:57:16,440
Actually, she requires no hand-holding,

5439
04:57:16,440 --> 04:57:18,440
she gets to fucking work.

5440
04:57:30,440 --> 04:57:32,440
Sorry, I need to fart, hold on.

5441
04:57:42,440 --> 04:57:44,440
And we didn't hear it,

5442
04:57:44,440 --> 04:57:46,440
but that was a bum note.

5443
04:57:49,440 --> 04:57:51,440
Oh, hell no!

5444
04:57:52,440 --> 04:57:54,440
Oh no, I missed it!

5445
04:57:54,440 --> 04:57:56,440
I was too busy farting, unironically,

5446
04:57:56,440 --> 04:57:58,440
to see her rat.

5447
04:57:58,440 --> 04:58:00,440
She's almost at 28,

5448
04:58:00,440 --> 04:58:02,440
oh my god, 20% of the way

5449
04:58:02,440 --> 04:58:04,440
to a play button is insane, that's fantastic.

5450
04:58:04,440 --> 04:58:06,440
I hope she gets that play button, I really do.

5451
04:58:06,440 --> 04:58:08,440
I'll put my stonks into her.

5452
04:58:09,440 --> 04:58:11,440
Imagine her getting a play button.

5453
04:58:11,440 --> 04:58:13,440
I could already see it,

5454
04:58:13,440 --> 04:58:15,440
she'd like piss on it in a video or something.

5455
04:58:15,440 --> 04:58:17,440
She'd be like,

5456
04:58:17,440 --> 04:58:19,440
I started the peeler allegations,

5457
04:58:19,440 --> 04:58:21,440
I'ma end them right here, like pee on it in a video.

5458
04:58:25,440 --> 04:58:27,440
Aw, they're so shy!

5459
04:58:33,440 --> 04:58:35,440
Hold on, I'm gonna drop

5460
04:58:35,440 --> 04:58:37,440
the blueberry crumbs on the floor.

5461
04:58:37,440 --> 04:58:39,440
That'll prove her, and

5462
04:58:39,440 --> 04:58:41,440
I'll probably

5463
04:58:41,440 --> 04:58:44,440
get the motivation to clean up in like two months' time.

5464
04:58:44,440 --> 04:58:46,440
But right now, no.

5465
04:58:46,440 --> 04:58:48,440
I'm doing no cleaning.

5466
04:58:51,440 --> 04:58:54,440
Whenever I am creative,

5467
04:58:54,440 --> 04:58:57,440
my entire, like, dwelling

5468
04:58:57,440 --> 04:58:59,440
turns to shit when I'm really creative

5469
04:58:59,440 --> 04:59:01,440
and like in the zone, and then I wake up

5470
04:59:01,440 --> 04:59:03,440
on the other end and I'm like, oh, this place is a mess.

5471
04:59:04,440 --> 04:59:06,440
Oh, hello, Luna!

5472
04:59:09,440 --> 04:59:11,440
Oh, look at that we have

5473
04:59:11,440 --> 04:59:13,440
like half kind of light brown on top

5474
04:59:13,440 --> 04:59:15,440
and then the white on the body

5475
04:59:15,440 --> 04:59:17,440
and then a little mark and that's precious.

5476
04:59:20,440 --> 04:59:22,440
Here we go.

5477
04:59:24,440 --> 04:59:26,440
Oh, she shoulders her feet!

5478
04:59:34,440 --> 04:59:36,440
Aw.

5479
04:59:39,440 --> 04:59:41,440
Aw!

5480
04:59:41,440 --> 04:59:43,440
That's right, that's right,

5481
04:59:43,440 --> 04:59:45,440
guilt tripper into signing the contract for another year.

5482
04:59:45,440 --> 04:59:47,440
Yes! Yes!

5483
04:59:47,440 --> 04:59:49,440
Make all the girls want to be on for another year!

5484
04:59:49,440 --> 04:59:51,440
I'm so nervous about them not wanting to be on

5485
04:59:51,440 --> 04:59:53,440
for another year, I have to be honest.

5486
04:59:53,440 --> 04:59:55,440
I'm like, next year,

5487
04:59:55,440 --> 04:59:57,440
A515 split,

5488
04:59:57,440 --> 04:59:59,440
and they get an alternative costume

5489
04:59:59,440 --> 05:00:01,440
and I'm so nervous they don't want to sign on.

5490
05:00:01,440 --> 05:00:03,440
Like, I'm actually fucking bricking it

5491
05:00:03,440 --> 05:00:05,440
when it comes to me next year.

5492
05:00:05,440 --> 05:00:07,440
Like, do you guys want to sign on again? Smile.

5493
05:00:07,440 --> 05:00:09,440
Did we do enough for you? Smile.

5494
05:00:09,440 --> 05:00:11,440
Oh, my God!

5495
05:00:11,440 --> 05:00:13,440
Look at the wee thing!

5496
05:00:13,440 --> 05:00:15,440
Oh, she got red eyes?

5497
05:00:15,440 --> 05:00:17,440
Or...

5498
05:00:17,440 --> 05:00:19,440
I'm glad it was the camera.

5499
05:00:19,440 --> 05:00:21,440
How long is her initial contract?

5500
05:00:21,440 --> 05:00:23,440
Runs out on June 1st.

5501
05:00:23,440 --> 05:00:25,440
Like, well, technically May 31st,

5502
05:00:25,440 --> 05:00:27,440
but...

5503
05:00:27,440 --> 05:00:29,440
I wouldn't make them stream

5504
05:00:29,440 --> 05:00:31,440
on June 1st, that doesn't make sense.

5505
05:00:31,440 --> 05:00:33,440
Like...

5506
05:00:33,440 --> 05:00:35,440
But it does expire June 1st.

5507
05:00:35,440 --> 05:00:37,440
Obviously,

5508
05:00:37,440 --> 05:00:39,440
they can sign the contract in advance

5509
05:00:39,440 --> 05:00:41,440
for a second year, I'll ask them in May.

5510
05:00:41,440 --> 05:00:43,440
I'm fucking bricking it.

5511
05:00:45,440 --> 05:00:47,440
I'm not scared of many things,

5512
05:00:47,440 --> 05:00:49,440
but the contract renewal,

5513
05:00:49,440 --> 05:00:51,440
that's what I'm fucking terrified of.

5514
05:00:51,440 --> 05:00:53,440
That's what truly shits me up at night,

5515
05:00:53,440 --> 05:00:55,440
is the contract renewal.

5516
05:00:55,440 --> 05:00:57,440
Where I have to be like,

5517
05:00:57,440 --> 05:00:59,440
did you enjoy your time here?

5518
05:00:59,440 --> 05:01:01,440
Do you want to come on another year

5519
05:01:01,440 --> 05:01:03,440
under this IP?

5520
05:01:03,440 --> 05:01:05,440
And all that.

5521
05:01:05,440 --> 05:01:07,440
Just let them end on February

5522
05:01:07,440 --> 05:01:09,440
29th.

5523
05:01:09,440 --> 05:01:11,440
How does that mean?

5524
05:01:11,440 --> 05:01:13,440
What happens on the 29th?

5525
05:01:17,440 --> 05:01:19,440
I have poppin' kit,

5526
05:01:19,440 --> 05:01:21,440
but mine's different from Amy's.

5527
05:01:21,440 --> 05:01:23,440
Mine was like...

5528
05:01:23,440 --> 05:01:25,440
It's a leap year?

5529
05:01:25,440 --> 05:01:27,440
There you go. Sorry!

5530
05:01:27,440 --> 05:01:29,440
Sorry!

5531
05:01:29,440 --> 05:01:31,440
Maybe?

5532
05:01:33,440 --> 05:01:35,440
Mods based on...

5533
05:01:39,440 --> 05:01:41,440
No, they need to be...

5534
05:01:41,440 --> 05:01:43,440
Yep.

5535
05:01:43,440 --> 05:01:45,440
Yep.

5536
05:01:45,440 --> 05:01:47,440
Mods can't have rates to do that kind of stuff

5537
05:01:47,440 --> 05:01:49,440
where they cause chaos on stream.

5538
05:01:49,440 --> 05:01:51,440
One fear, truly.

5539
05:01:51,440 --> 05:01:53,440
29th is a leap year.

5540
05:01:53,440 --> 05:01:55,440
She didn't know the mods meant no.

5541
05:01:55,440 --> 05:01:57,440
If they're a different kind of moderator,

5542
05:01:57,440 --> 05:01:59,440
then we can, but...

5543
05:02:05,440 --> 05:02:07,440
I hope they have fun and decide to stay a little while.

5544
05:02:07,440 --> 05:02:09,440
I bloody hope so, too.

5545
05:02:09,440 --> 05:02:11,440
I really hope they achieve new heights

5546
05:02:11,440 --> 05:02:13,440
under me type thing.

5547
05:02:13,440 --> 05:02:15,440
It's not really under me,

5548
05:02:15,440 --> 05:02:17,440
let's be honest.

5549
05:02:19,440 --> 05:02:21,440
Just follow it under the table

5550
05:02:21,440 --> 05:02:23,440
to get the emotion and stuff.

5551
05:02:25,440 --> 05:02:27,440
We actually, that clipping program,

5552
05:02:27,440 --> 05:02:29,440
I'm a bit miffed at myself.

5553
05:02:29,440 --> 05:02:31,440
I really don't like it,

5554
05:02:31,440 --> 05:02:33,440
but it's the only way I can see it.

5555
05:02:33,440 --> 05:02:35,440
For established,

5556
05:02:35,440 --> 05:02:37,440
we need established clipping channels

5557
05:02:37,440 --> 05:02:39,440
to clip the girls.

5558
05:02:39,440 --> 05:02:41,440
I've had to lure...

5559
05:02:41,440 --> 05:02:43,440
So the base fee is you get paid

5560
05:02:43,440 --> 05:02:45,440
10 quids for clipping the girl.

5561
05:02:45,440 --> 05:02:47,440
And then you get paid

5562
05:02:47,440 --> 05:02:49,440
$2...

5563
05:02:49,440 --> 05:02:51,440
$10 per clip,

5564
05:02:51,440 --> 05:02:53,440
even if it's a minute long type thing.

5565
05:02:53,440 --> 05:02:55,440
As long as you're not taking the piss,

5566
05:02:55,440 --> 05:02:57,440
there's going to be a disclaimer

5567
05:02:57,440 --> 05:02:59,440
and be like, if you get accepted

5568
05:02:59,440 --> 05:03:01,440
and then you're shipping out low quality stuff

5569
05:03:01,440 --> 05:03:03,440
just to claim that 10 quid

5570
05:03:03,440 --> 05:03:05,440
over and over again, we have the right to be

5571
05:03:05,440 --> 05:03:07,440
like, right, we're not going to do business with you anymore.

5572
05:03:07,440 --> 05:03:09,440
And it's $2 per every

5573
05:03:09,440 --> 05:03:11,440
1000 views.

5574
05:03:11,440 --> 05:03:13,440
I need to write it out in all the terms in that,

5575
05:03:13,440 --> 05:03:15,440
but it launches on August 1st,

5576
05:03:15,440 --> 05:03:17,440
and I hope it goes well.

5577
05:03:17,440 --> 05:03:19,440
There'll be a section on the website as well,

5578
05:03:19,440 --> 05:03:21,440
that mentions it.

5579
05:03:21,440 --> 05:03:23,440
I think I'm going to take down the

5580
05:03:23,440 --> 05:03:25,440
who's on the team,

5581
05:03:25,440 --> 05:03:27,440
because it's so outdated.

5582
05:03:27,440 --> 05:03:29,440
There's so many more people now.

5583
05:03:29,440 --> 05:03:31,440
It's just ridiculous.

5584
05:03:31,440 --> 05:03:33,440
And there's like, the script writers

5585
05:03:33,440 --> 05:03:35,440
that are listed on the website

5586
05:03:35,440 --> 05:03:37,440
are no longer on the team,

5587
05:03:37,440 --> 05:03:39,440
because we now have a script master,

5588
05:03:39,440 --> 05:03:41,440
like that's outdated.

5589
05:03:41,440 --> 05:03:43,440
I think I'm just going to take it down.

5590
05:03:47,440 --> 05:03:49,440
Wait, how did he predict 3 hours?

5591
05:03:49,440 --> 05:03:51,440
How did he predict 3 hours?

5592
05:03:51,440 --> 05:03:53,440
How did he predict 3 hours?

5593
05:03:53,440 --> 05:03:55,440
How did he predict 3 hours?

5594
05:03:55,440 --> 05:03:57,440
How did he predict 3 hours?

5595
05:03:57,440 --> 05:03:59,440
Can't celebrate drinking wine

5596
05:03:59,440 --> 05:04:01,440
since it's all getting sold to the Grand Exchange,

5597
05:04:01,440 --> 05:04:03,440
honestly.

5598
05:04:03,440 --> 05:04:05,440
Stony, don't play Splatoon.

5599
05:04:05,440 --> 05:04:07,440
No, I've never played it before.

5600
05:04:07,440 --> 05:04:09,440
Apparently it's not a very good stream game.

5601
05:04:09,440 --> 05:04:11,440
And we're in the 19,000s

5602
05:04:11,440 --> 05:04:13,440
if I didn't celebrate that yet.

5603
05:04:17,440 --> 05:04:19,440
Wow.

5604
05:04:19,440 --> 05:04:21,440
Another proof every stream is pre-recorded.

5605
05:04:21,440 --> 05:04:23,440
This is all a lie.

5606
05:04:23,440 --> 05:04:25,440
Literally, I was like, how did they record that?

5607
05:04:25,440 --> 05:04:27,440
How did they predict that it was 3 hours long?

5608
05:04:29,440 --> 05:04:31,440
Would you end it?

5609
05:04:31,440 --> 05:04:33,440
Yeah, there we go.

5610
05:04:33,440 --> 05:04:35,440
If they're not under you, we can't.

5611
05:04:35,440 --> 05:04:37,440
I'd rather talk to you.

5612
05:04:37,440 --> 05:04:39,440
Would you make a discord if you had the chance?

5613
05:04:39,440 --> 05:04:41,440
Um...

5614
05:04:41,440 --> 05:04:43,440
History...

5615
05:04:43,440 --> 05:04:45,440
There is a notification discord.

5616
05:04:45,440 --> 05:04:47,440
Yes, but...

5617
05:04:47,440 --> 05:04:49,440
I predicted 3 hours because I'm the stream script writer

5618
05:04:49,440 --> 05:04:51,440
for the long run.

5619
05:04:51,440 --> 05:04:53,440
Okay, that's why we're removing who's on the team

5620
05:04:53,440 --> 05:04:55,440
is to hide the fact that we have

5621
05:04:55,440 --> 05:04:57,440
a stream script writer.

5622
05:04:57,440 --> 05:04:59,440
Thank you, tiny spiny.

5623
05:04:59,440 --> 05:05:01,440
I can't believe it.

5624
05:05:03,440 --> 05:05:05,440
Um...

5625
05:05:05,440 --> 05:05:07,440
Two hours streams it with some success,

5626
05:05:07,440 --> 05:05:09,440
but it can be a hit or miss, depending on what occurs.

5627
05:05:09,440 --> 05:05:11,440
Stony, take exposure like that for me.

5628
05:05:11,440 --> 05:05:13,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5629
05:05:13,440 --> 05:05:15,440
Um...

5630
05:05:15,440 --> 05:05:17,440
There's a notification only discord

5631
05:05:17,440 --> 05:05:19,440
for Veeler.

5632
05:05:19,440 --> 05:05:21,440
If you want to not miss

5633
05:05:21,440 --> 05:05:23,440
anything from your particular

5634
05:05:23,440 --> 05:05:25,440
girl that you like,

5635
05:05:25,440 --> 05:05:27,440
or if you like us all.

5636
05:05:27,440 --> 05:05:29,440
It'll notify you short,

5637
05:05:29,440 --> 05:05:31,440
it'll notify you streams, it'll notify you videos.

5638
05:05:31,440 --> 05:05:33,440
And it's good for the algorithm

5639
05:05:33,440 --> 05:05:35,440
for the girls to have

5640
05:05:35,440 --> 05:05:37,440
a link that shares

5641
05:05:37,440 --> 05:05:39,440
the embed and all that.

5642
05:05:39,440 --> 05:05:41,440
Like, it's good for their promotion.

5643
05:05:41,440 --> 05:05:43,440
So, if you feel so inclined

5644
05:05:43,440 --> 05:05:45,440
on the Veeler Twitter's

5645
05:05:45,440 --> 05:05:47,440
pinned post,

5646
05:05:47,440 --> 05:05:49,440
you can...

5647
05:05:49,440 --> 05:05:51,440
Um...

5648
05:05:51,440 --> 05:05:53,440
You can just join

5649
05:05:53,440 --> 05:05:55,440
and it literally, you just click who you want

5650
05:05:55,440 --> 05:05:57,440
and then that's it all done.

5651
05:05:57,440 --> 05:05:59,440
Oh, there you go. There's an invite.

5652
05:05:59,440 --> 05:06:01,440
And no, find me about your clip today.

5653
05:06:01,440 --> 05:06:03,440
Oh, we'll clip him out today.

5654
05:06:03,440 --> 05:06:05,440
God, Emmy's coughing up a storm.

5655
05:06:05,440 --> 05:06:07,440
I think I need to tell her maybe this...

5656
05:06:09,440 --> 05:06:11,440
...

5657
05:06:11,440 --> 05:06:13,440
... her daughter.

5658
05:06:13,440 --> 05:06:15,440
Okay.

5659
05:06:15,440 --> 05:06:17,440
Can I say something behind the scenes

5660
05:06:17,440 --> 05:06:19,440
that you guys already know

5661
05:06:19,440 --> 05:06:21,440
that you're not really supposed to say?

5662
05:06:21,440 --> 05:06:23,440
I told her she can knock off the voice

5663
05:06:23,440 --> 05:06:25,440
if it's affecting her too much.

5664
05:06:25,440 --> 05:06:27,440
And she'll take it

5665
05:06:27,440 --> 05:06:29,440
and, you know, she's got full permission to

5666
05:06:29,440 --> 05:06:31,440
not use that.

5667
05:06:31,440 --> 05:06:33,440
I don't want to damage her beyond repair.

5668
05:06:33,440 --> 05:06:35,440
That's not my intention.

5669
05:06:35,440 --> 05:06:37,440
And...

5670
05:06:38,440 --> 05:06:40,440
I think that cough started

5671
05:06:40,440 --> 05:06:42,440
when she started her voice,

5672
05:06:42,440 --> 05:06:44,440
unfortunately, which makes me worried,

5673
05:06:44,440 --> 05:06:46,440
but, um, yeah...

5674
05:06:48,440 --> 05:06:50,440
Muppered.

5675
05:06:50,440 --> 05:06:52,440
Muppered, baby.

5676
05:06:52,440 --> 05:06:54,440
Gosh, she has such tiny hands.

5677
05:06:54,440 --> 05:06:56,440
I feel like she must be tiny in real life.

5678
05:06:56,440 --> 05:06:58,440
Like, you know how my hands are

5679
05:06:58,440 --> 05:07:00,440
like, kinda like long...

5680
05:07:00,440 --> 05:07:02,440
elongated kinda hands?

5681
05:07:02,440 --> 05:07:05,440
Because Emmy's hands are so tiny,

5682
05:07:05,440 --> 05:07:07,440
I think I'm, like, way taller than her.

5683
05:07:07,440 --> 05:07:09,440
I must be. There's no way in hell I'm not.

5684
05:07:09,440 --> 05:07:11,440
If we're comparing our hands...

5685
05:07:20,440 --> 05:07:22,440
Your hands are cute.

5686
05:07:22,440 --> 05:07:24,440
I've got elongated hands compared to Emmy.

5687
05:07:24,440 --> 05:07:26,440
Definitely elongated.

5688
05:07:31,440 --> 05:07:33,440
Okay.

5689
05:07:35,440 --> 05:07:37,440
Okay.

5690
05:07:43,440 --> 05:07:45,440
Oh, my God! I know what she's talking about!

5691
05:07:47,440 --> 05:07:49,440
I know what she's talking about.

5692
05:07:50,440 --> 05:07:52,440
I know exactly what she's talking about!

5693
05:07:54,440 --> 05:07:56,440
No, there's no advice. It's just an army, darlin'.

5694
05:07:56,440 --> 05:07:58,440
It either works for you or it does me.

5695
05:08:01,440 --> 05:08:03,440
Yes, Johnny, your hands are cute.

5696
05:08:03,440 --> 05:08:05,440
Johnny, your hands are beautiful.

5697
05:08:05,440 --> 05:08:07,440
And I'd like to take one of that.

5698
05:08:07,440 --> 05:08:09,440
Your arse!

5699
05:08:09,440 --> 05:08:11,440
I'll finish that sentence for you.

5700
05:08:11,440 --> 05:08:13,440
Johnny's wet, sweaty hands.

5701
05:08:13,440 --> 05:08:15,440
My persipitation hands.

5702
05:08:21,440 --> 05:08:23,440
I'm gonna get highlight made of the stream.

5703
05:08:23,440 --> 05:08:25,440
I'm needing highlight, folk.

5704
05:08:27,440 --> 05:08:29,440
We've got short people now.

5705
05:08:29,440 --> 05:08:31,440
Wait, that sounds bizarre.

5706
05:08:31,440 --> 05:08:33,440
We've got people that make shorts in now,

5707
05:08:33,440 --> 05:08:35,440
but I'm needing highlight glitter.

5708
05:08:35,440 --> 05:08:37,440
Highlight.

5709
05:08:37,440 --> 05:08:39,440
They'll go through a two-hour vod and then make the highlight.

5710
05:08:41,440 --> 05:08:43,440
Mercy got one, but that editor,

5711
05:08:43,440 --> 05:08:45,440
Chaco editor,

5712
05:08:45,440 --> 05:08:47,440
he's absolutely fucking phenomenal,

5713
05:08:47,440 --> 05:08:49,440
but he took so long to do the Mercy.

5714
05:08:49,440 --> 05:08:51,440
I'm like, nah, we need you for shorts for the girls.

5715
05:08:51,440 --> 05:08:53,440
So he's not getting another highlight stream again.

5716
05:08:55,440 --> 05:08:57,440
Emmy's got two really good shorts coming out

5717
05:08:57,440 --> 05:08:59,440
once they're produced.

5718
05:08:59,440 --> 05:09:01,440
I'm really happy with them.

5719
05:09:01,440 --> 05:09:03,440
You have short people, stop.

5720
05:09:03,440 --> 05:09:05,440
They're in my basement.

5721
05:09:05,440 --> 05:09:07,440
Strongly slick digits, honestly.

5722
05:09:07,440 --> 05:09:09,440
Optimal hands for ASMR.

5723
05:09:09,440 --> 05:09:11,440
I mean, I can always fart with my hands.

5724
05:09:13,440 --> 05:09:15,440
Because they're always sweaty.

5725
05:09:19,440 --> 05:09:21,440
They just never stop.

5726
05:09:21,440 --> 05:09:23,440
My feet are worse.

5727
05:09:25,440 --> 05:09:27,440
Wait, who are you, Willy Wonka?

5728
05:09:27,440 --> 05:09:29,440
I'm gonna screw up Wonka and the Willy, because it's certainly me.

5729
05:09:47,440 --> 05:09:49,440
Covered in siren slain.

5730
05:09:49,440 --> 05:09:51,440
Honestly, real.

5731
05:09:51,440 --> 05:09:53,440
She brapped on stream.

5732
05:09:53,440 --> 05:09:55,440
Emmy?

5733
05:09:55,440 --> 05:09:57,440
Oh no, you mean me.

5734
05:09:57,440 --> 05:09:59,440
So fucking did my hand.

5735
05:09:59,440 --> 05:10:01,440
Thank you for real Joker, for real, for real,

5736
05:10:01,440 --> 05:10:03,440
for becoming a member.

5737
05:10:03,440 --> 05:10:05,440
Enjoy all the parts.

5738
05:10:05,440 --> 05:10:07,440
We do membership streams all the time.

5739
05:10:07,440 --> 05:10:09,440
Me.

5740
05:10:09,440 --> 05:10:11,440
What are we doing?

5741
05:10:11,440 --> 05:10:13,440
Hold on.

5742
05:10:25,440 --> 05:10:27,440
Hello?

5743
05:10:27,440 --> 05:10:29,440
Am I bad?

5744
05:10:33,440 --> 05:10:35,440
What the ffff?

5745
05:10:37,440 --> 05:10:39,440
I went to go show my schedule

5746
05:10:39,440 --> 05:10:41,440
and then OBS just shut down.

5747
05:10:43,440 --> 05:10:45,440
Bruh.

5748
05:10:49,440 --> 05:10:51,440
Did you not see me go offline?

5749
05:10:51,440 --> 05:10:53,440
Offline?

5750
05:10:53,440 --> 05:10:55,440
Did you not see that?

5751
05:11:05,440 --> 05:11:07,440
You didn't go offline for us, just start buffering.

5752
05:11:07,440 --> 05:11:09,440
Oh, my OBS closed down.

5753
05:11:11,440 --> 05:11:13,440
They gave up.

5754
05:11:13,440 --> 05:11:15,440
I was gone, I was literally offline.

5755
05:11:15,440 --> 05:11:17,440
I was like, hello?

5756
05:11:17,440 --> 05:11:19,440
Did I just take my meds?

5757
05:11:19,440 --> 05:11:21,440
Where's my refling?

5758
05:11:23,440 --> 05:11:25,440
Hash, are you telling me?

5759
05:11:27,440 --> 05:11:29,440
Your bodily function.

5760
05:11:29,440 --> 05:11:31,440
Oh, are we ran?

5761
05:11:31,440 --> 05:11:33,440
Oh, he's a little curious.

5762
05:11:33,440 --> 05:11:35,440
Oh, you need to be careful.

5763
05:11:35,440 --> 05:11:37,440
Look at the wee tail.

5764
05:11:43,440 --> 05:11:45,440
Oh, careful.

5765
05:11:45,440 --> 05:11:47,440
No running with scissors.

5766
05:11:47,440 --> 05:11:49,440
I almost threw up.

5767
05:11:49,440 --> 05:11:51,440
No, no, no, keep it in, keep it in, keep it in.

5768
05:11:51,440 --> 05:11:53,440
Keep it inside.

5769
05:11:53,440 --> 05:11:55,440
They don't know you can't go on without reflings

5770
05:11:55,440 --> 05:11:57,440
if they know they are evil.

5771
05:11:57,440 --> 05:11:59,440
Meds taken, reflings gone.

5772
05:11:59,440 --> 05:12:01,440
You buffered and I started crying.

5773
05:12:05,440 --> 05:12:07,440
Well, literally, I went to go show my schedule

5774
05:12:07,440 --> 05:12:09,440
because I was thanking

5775
05:12:11,440 --> 05:12:13,440
for Real Joker for becoming a member.

5776
05:12:13,440 --> 05:12:15,440
I was like, oh, let's talk about my membership streams this week.

5777
05:12:15,440 --> 05:12:17,440
And then the thing just

5778
05:12:17,440 --> 05:12:19,440
fucking blew off on me.

5779
05:12:19,440 --> 05:12:21,440
I'm like, okay, I'm not doing that again, I guess.

5780
05:12:21,440 --> 05:12:23,440
I guess it'll be a surprise when I put up my roster.

5781
05:12:25,440 --> 05:12:27,440
Also, I love how I go on Amy's channel

5782
05:12:27,440 --> 05:12:29,440
to watch the VOD in the first video.

5783
05:12:29,440 --> 05:12:31,440
I see is, would you date a cook?

5784
05:12:31,440 --> 05:12:33,440
Oh, that takes so long to get up.

5785
05:12:33,440 --> 05:12:35,440
It's so long.

5786
05:12:37,440 --> 05:12:39,440
Whoa, she's so close to 20K.

5787
05:12:39,440 --> 05:12:41,440
I'm so happy.

5788
05:12:41,440 --> 05:12:43,440
Would you date Esteban?

5789
05:12:45,440 --> 05:12:47,440
Who said that?

5790
05:12:53,440 --> 05:12:55,440
Point and laugh at cook was so fun.

5791
05:12:57,440 --> 05:12:59,440
It's also fun she crashed when Esteban appears.

5792
05:13:11,440 --> 05:13:13,440
No, she doesn't think there's...

5793
05:13:13,440 --> 05:13:15,440
I mean, she owns them,

5794
05:13:15,440 --> 05:13:17,440
so I'll take her word over it

5795
05:13:17,440 --> 05:13:19,440
than anyone else's.

5796
05:13:21,440 --> 05:13:23,440
Esteban's a lady rat?

5797
05:13:23,440 --> 05:13:25,440
Mm-hmm.

5798
05:13:25,440 --> 05:13:27,440
Yeah, she's a lady rat.

5799
05:13:27,440 --> 05:13:29,440
Yeah, she's a lady rat.

5800
05:13:29,440 --> 05:13:31,440
Yeah, she's a lady rat.

5801
05:13:31,440 --> 05:13:33,440
Yeah, she's a lady rat.

5802
05:13:33,440 --> 05:13:35,440
Yeah, she's a lady rat.

5803
05:13:35,440 --> 05:13:37,440
Yeah, she's a lady rat.

5804
05:13:37,440 --> 05:13:39,440
Oh, Esteban's a lady rat?

5805
05:13:39,440 --> 05:13:41,440
Mm-hmm.

5806
05:13:41,440 --> 05:13:43,440
The channel growth of all the ladies in present.

5807
05:13:43,440 --> 05:13:45,440
Yeah.

5808
05:13:45,440 --> 05:13:47,440
I'm so close to revealing the 10K art.

5809
05:13:47,440 --> 05:13:49,440
I'm so...

5810
05:13:49,440 --> 05:13:51,440
I'm so excited.

5811
05:13:51,440 --> 05:13:53,440
10K art.

5812
05:13:53,440 --> 05:13:55,440
Soon TM.

5813
05:13:55,440 --> 05:13:57,440
You guys are not ready

5814
05:13:57,440 --> 05:13:59,440
for what I ordered.

5815
05:13:59,440 --> 05:14:01,440
I ordered it. Order.

5816
05:14:01,440 --> 05:14:03,440
I ordered it ages ago. I'm so excited to show it.

5817
05:14:03,440 --> 05:14:05,440
Soon TM.

5818
05:14:05,440 --> 05:14:07,440
Soon TM.

5819
05:14:07,440 --> 05:14:09,440
It's real. It's coming.

5820
05:14:11,440 --> 05:14:13,440
You bomb?

5821
05:14:15,440 --> 05:14:17,440
She's dying.

5822
05:14:17,440 --> 05:14:19,440
I'm her little sister.

5823
05:14:19,440 --> 05:14:21,440
I must protect.

5824
05:14:25,440 --> 05:14:27,440
Uh-huh.

5825
05:14:27,440 --> 05:14:29,440
Uh-huh.

5826
05:14:29,440 --> 05:14:31,440
They're like hamsters explode when they die.

5827
05:14:31,440 --> 05:14:33,440
They never die a natural death.

5828
05:14:33,440 --> 05:14:35,440
They just like fucking...

5829
05:14:35,440 --> 05:14:37,440
do something in batshit and scene.

5830
05:14:43,440 --> 05:14:45,440
What were your tongue looks like?

5831
05:14:47,440 --> 05:14:49,440
Got something physics.

5832
05:14:49,440 --> 05:14:51,440
What are you going to do for 20K an aspect?

5833
05:14:51,440 --> 05:14:53,440
I've already agreed on it.

5834
05:14:53,440 --> 05:14:55,440
I've got...

5835
05:14:55,440 --> 05:14:57,440
Oh, sorry. On YouTube.

5836
05:14:57,440 --> 05:14:59,440
I'm going to do a work out

5837
05:14:59,440 --> 05:15:01,440
ASMR stream on Ring Fit

5838
05:15:01,440 --> 05:15:03,440
for one hour and then a shower.

5839
05:15:03,440 --> 05:15:05,440
ASMR.

5840
05:15:05,440 --> 05:15:07,440
Like, I'm bringing the microphone and then the shower with me.

5841
05:15:07,440 --> 05:15:09,440
Hello?

5842
05:15:09,440 --> 05:15:11,440
Uh-huh.

5843
05:15:13,440 --> 05:15:15,440
And then on the elsewhere, we're going to pick.

5844
05:15:23,440 --> 05:15:25,440
Hmm, sure.

5845
05:15:25,440 --> 05:15:27,440
I've got my poodles.

5846
05:15:29,440 --> 05:15:31,440
Hmm.

5847
05:15:31,440 --> 05:15:33,440
Spank my peach.

5848
05:15:33,440 --> 05:15:35,440
He's spanking my peach with my own emote.

5849
05:15:35,440 --> 05:15:37,440
What's going on here?

5850
05:15:39,440 --> 05:15:41,440
I'll definitely make sure I've eaten

5851
05:15:41,440 --> 05:15:43,440
properly before that stream so I don't have

5852
05:15:43,440 --> 05:15:45,440
a repeat of last time on Ring Fit where I was

5853
05:15:45,440 --> 05:15:47,440
like perishing.

5854
05:15:47,440 --> 05:15:49,440
And I'll definitely test the freaking audio

5855
05:15:49,440 --> 05:15:51,440
so I'm not blown out this time.

5856
05:15:51,440 --> 05:15:53,440
I'm so annoyed that stream got blown out.

5857
05:15:59,440 --> 05:16:01,440
Ha!

5858
05:16:01,440 --> 05:16:03,440
He's like,

5859
05:16:03,440 --> 05:16:05,440
give it back!

5860
05:16:11,440 --> 05:16:13,440
Aww,

5861
05:16:13,440 --> 05:16:15,440
that's her rat origin story.

5862
05:16:15,440 --> 05:16:17,440
That's so sweet.

5863
05:16:21,440 --> 05:16:23,440
Yeah!

5864
05:16:23,440 --> 05:16:25,440
They all pop their clogs

5865
05:16:25,440 --> 05:16:27,440
like randomly.

5866
05:16:27,440 --> 05:16:29,440
Lucky got to touch the peach.

5867
05:16:29,440 --> 05:16:31,440
Don't worry, we have fun anyway.

5868
05:16:39,440 --> 05:16:41,440
Oh!

5869
05:16:43,440 --> 05:16:45,440
Well, we're getting educated

5870
05:16:45,440 --> 05:16:47,440
in this stream.

5871
05:16:49,440 --> 05:16:51,440
I don't know how hamsters work up in the head.

5872
05:16:53,440 --> 05:16:55,440
Ah.

5873
05:16:57,440 --> 05:16:59,440
Oh.

5874
05:16:59,440 --> 05:17:01,440
Oh.

5875
05:17:01,440 --> 05:17:03,440
Yeah.

5876
05:17:11,440 --> 05:17:13,440
Uh,

5877
05:17:13,440 --> 05:17:15,440
is it stream elements that prompts that?

5878
05:17:15,440 --> 05:17:17,440
I don't know.

5879
05:17:17,440 --> 05:17:19,440
Yab!

5880
05:17:23,440 --> 05:17:25,440
I don't really think

5881
05:17:25,440 --> 05:17:27,440
I'm so happy.

5882
05:17:27,440 --> 05:17:29,440
Oh, we're at 9 million eggs

5883
05:17:29,440 --> 05:17:31,440
p though.

5884
05:17:37,440 --> 05:17:39,440
You know, I could see myself when I retire

5885
05:17:39,440 --> 05:17:41,440
just saying fuck it in like 100%

5886
05:17:41,440 --> 05:17:43,440
in our RuneScape account just for the hell of it.

5887
05:17:43,440 --> 05:17:45,440
I don't know how to do it for other stuff.

5888
05:17:47,440 --> 05:17:49,440
My skills.

5889
05:17:49,440 --> 05:17:51,440
So you can just slay her for all of this.

5890
05:17:51,440 --> 05:17:53,440
Um.

5891
05:17:55,440 --> 05:17:57,440
Did they change RuneCraft?

5892
05:17:57,440 --> 05:17:59,440
I think someone said they changed RuneCraft

5893
05:17:59,440 --> 05:18:01,440
so it's not as bad. Maybe Gargon would be like

5894
05:18:01,440 --> 05:18:03,440
the worst thing one.

5895
05:18:03,440 --> 05:18:05,440
Maybe like Fletching in one go.

5896
05:18:05,440 --> 05:18:07,440
Oh, my poor little sister.

5897
05:18:07,440 --> 05:18:09,440
I didn't realize how bad it was hurting her throat.

5898
05:18:13,440 --> 05:18:15,440
Oh, little rat on screen.

5899
05:18:15,440 --> 05:18:17,440
I like how they just walk in

5900
05:18:17,440 --> 05:18:19,440
and out of frame and out of their leisure.

5901
05:18:19,440 --> 05:18:21,440
I think there's a minigame

5902
05:18:21,440 --> 05:18:23,440
for it now.

5903
05:18:23,440 --> 05:18:25,440
I'm gonna hook it.

5904
05:18:25,440 --> 05:18:27,440
Max Cape's little fish.

5905
05:18:27,440 --> 05:18:29,440
Oh!

5906
05:18:37,440 --> 05:18:39,440
That's so cute.

5907
05:18:45,440 --> 05:18:47,440
In Japanese?

5908
05:18:47,440 --> 05:18:49,440
Are you okay?

5909
05:18:49,440 --> 05:18:51,440
How are you?

5910
05:18:59,440 --> 05:19:01,440
Really?

5911
05:19:01,440 --> 05:19:03,440
Oh, I see.

5912
05:19:03,440 --> 05:19:05,440
I'm Japanese.

5913
05:19:07,440 --> 05:19:09,440
Farming will take a while.

5914
05:19:09,440 --> 05:19:11,440
Mommy's gonna have a word with me.

5915
05:19:11,440 --> 05:19:13,440
No, I messaged her like a couple of days ago

5916
05:19:13,440 --> 05:19:15,440
and I was just like, oh, I'm a little worried about your cough.

5917
05:19:15,440 --> 05:19:17,440
Cause I caught the back end

5918
05:19:17,440 --> 05:19:19,440
of one of her streams.

5919
05:19:19,440 --> 05:19:21,440
But this is me actually sitting down

5920
05:19:21,440 --> 05:19:23,440
watching one of her vods and I'm like,

5921
05:19:23,440 --> 05:19:25,440
oh, I'm like concerned.

5922
05:19:25,440 --> 05:19:27,440
I'm like, bruv.

5923
05:19:27,440 --> 05:19:29,440
Cause it was me

5924
05:19:29,440 --> 05:19:31,440
who kind of called the shots on the voice

5925
05:19:31,440 --> 05:19:33,440
and I'm like, I don't want to give you permanent damage.

5926
05:19:33,440 --> 05:19:35,440
Like, I don't give a fuck about me.

5927
05:19:35,440 --> 05:19:37,440
Like permanent damage on the map.

5928
05:19:37,440 --> 05:19:39,440
I'm not gonna subject someone else to permanent damage.

5929
05:19:39,440 --> 05:19:41,440
But I've given her full permission

5930
05:19:41,440 --> 05:19:43,440
to do what she wants.

5931
05:19:43,440 --> 05:19:45,440
If she wants to, you know,

5932
05:19:45,440 --> 05:19:47,440
pause Trump, then she most certainly can.

5933
05:19:51,440 --> 05:19:53,440
Cause I didn't realise, cause she was like, oh,

5934
05:19:53,440 --> 05:19:55,440
I need to clear my throat of phlegm now

5935
05:19:55,440 --> 05:19:57,440
all the time and I'm like, oh.

5936
05:20:01,440 --> 05:20:03,440
What's your favourite anime?

5937
05:20:07,440 --> 05:20:09,440
Kagaguri!

5938
05:20:09,440 --> 05:20:11,440
I love it because the protagonist is literally

5939
05:20:11,440 --> 05:20:13,440
me.

5940
05:20:13,440 --> 05:20:15,440
We're chopped off all my hair.

5941
05:20:15,440 --> 05:20:17,440
But my hair's coming back.

5942
05:20:17,440 --> 05:20:19,440
She seems to want to continue voicing.

5943
05:20:19,440 --> 05:20:21,440
Yeah, no, it's completely up to her.

5944
05:20:21,440 --> 05:20:23,440
But I just feel really bad though.

5945
05:20:23,440 --> 05:20:25,440
I'm like, oh.

5946
05:20:25,440 --> 05:20:27,440
I feel bad.

5947
05:20:27,440 --> 05:20:29,440
I feel like a bad mother.

5948
05:20:29,440 --> 05:20:31,440
Bad mother!

5949
05:20:35,440 --> 05:20:37,440
Never played RuneScape.

5950
05:20:37,440 --> 05:20:39,440
So what was RuneCrafting before?

5951
05:20:39,440 --> 05:20:41,440
So,

5952
05:20:41,440 --> 05:20:43,440
you take

5953
05:20:43,440 --> 05:20:45,440
your inventory of blank runes

5954
05:20:45,440 --> 05:20:47,440
and then you take it to a stone

5955
05:20:47,440 --> 05:20:49,440
and then the stone would convert it

5956
05:20:49,440 --> 05:20:51,440
into whatever rune that stone is.

5957
05:20:51,440 --> 05:20:53,440
But you only can have a max capacity

5958
05:20:53,440 --> 05:20:55,440
of 26 items, I think.

5959
05:20:57,440 --> 05:20:59,440
So you could hardly make any progress

5960
05:20:59,440 --> 05:21:01,440
like every run, if I'm not mistaken.

5961
05:21:01,440 --> 05:21:03,440
I never did it, but I was aware of it.

5962
05:21:03,440 --> 05:21:05,440
But apparently there's a minigame now

5963
05:21:05,440 --> 05:21:07,440
to kind of help you out a bit.

5964
05:21:07,440 --> 05:21:09,440
Sorry.

5965
05:21:11,440 --> 05:21:13,440
I find guinea pigs scary.

5966
05:21:13,440 --> 05:21:15,440
They look like they have the ability to think.

5967
05:21:15,440 --> 05:21:17,440
As soon as something has the ability to think,

5968
05:21:17,440 --> 05:21:19,440
I get nervous. I hate when Gimli looks at me

5969
05:21:19,440 --> 05:21:21,440
and I can tell she wants something

5970
05:21:21,440 --> 05:21:23,440
and I'm like, bruv, what do you want?

5971
05:21:23,440 --> 05:21:25,440
I have no idea.

5972
05:21:25,440 --> 05:21:27,440
What's your gamba skill at?

5973
05:21:27,440 --> 05:21:29,440
I don't know.

5974
05:21:29,440 --> 05:21:31,440
Ballot to win.

5975
05:21:31,440 --> 05:21:33,440
I wish.

5976
05:21:33,440 --> 05:21:35,440
I wanted to visit Supermarket Simulator.

5977
05:21:35,440 --> 05:21:37,440
I also really thoroughly enjoyed that game

5978
05:21:37,440 --> 05:21:39,440
but I don't know if I can make it in an opinion.

5979
05:21:39,440 --> 05:21:41,440
But I really enjoyed it.

5980
05:21:41,440 --> 05:21:43,440
If it was like the nice, kind of cozy,

5981
05:21:43,440 --> 05:21:45,440
satisfying game.

5982
05:21:45,440 --> 05:21:47,440
Having your refunds run essence for you

5983
05:21:47,440 --> 05:21:49,440
would probably be pretty good at.

5984
05:21:49,440 --> 05:21:51,440
Speed per hour stop.

5985
05:21:51,440 --> 05:21:53,440
Do you imagine?

5986
05:21:53,440 --> 05:21:55,440
Time to boost mummy on Rinsky.

5987
05:21:55,440 --> 05:21:57,440
Time to run dragon bones for me.

5988
05:21:57,440 --> 05:21:59,440
To the dragon altar.

5989
05:21:59,440 --> 05:22:01,440
Not the altar.

5990
05:22:01,440 --> 05:22:03,440
Not the dragon altar, the altar.

5991
05:22:03,440 --> 05:22:05,440
I feel that way about birds are too smart.

5992
05:22:07,440 --> 05:22:09,440
There's not a single thought in a guinea pig's head.

5993
05:22:09,440 --> 05:22:11,440
There are refunds in a nature altar

5994
05:22:11,440 --> 05:22:13,440
doing god knows what, literally.

5995
05:22:29,440 --> 05:22:31,440
Of course there's some of the most intelligent animals I've ever seen.

5996
05:22:31,440 --> 05:22:33,440
Mummy asked grieflings to...

5997
05:22:35,440 --> 05:22:37,440
Oh, she's jerking off.

5998
05:22:39,440 --> 05:22:41,440
I don't know, keep going, keep going, keep going.

5999
05:22:41,440 --> 05:22:43,440
I'm almost there.

6000
05:22:47,440 --> 05:22:49,440
The sounding blows really.

6001
05:22:49,440 --> 05:22:51,440
I love that one out of context.

6002
05:22:53,440 --> 05:22:55,440
Let's get some money and get poker.

6003
05:22:57,440 --> 05:22:59,440
Shawnee.

6004
05:22:59,440 --> 05:23:01,440
Have you run altars on old school runes?

6005
05:23:01,440 --> 05:23:03,440
Grieflings, yes, mummy.

6006
05:23:03,440 --> 05:23:05,440
You've been making account just to help mummy

6007
05:23:05,440 --> 05:23:07,440
on weekend runes go through.

6008
05:23:07,440 --> 05:23:09,440
Oh, you would!

6009
05:23:09,440 --> 05:23:11,440
You got to protect me from all the P.K.ers.

6010
05:23:11,440 --> 05:23:13,440
Leave us alone!

6011
05:23:13,440 --> 05:23:15,440
We're just travellers.

6012
05:23:15,440 --> 05:23:17,440
We just need to get to the altar, that's all.

6013
05:23:17,440 --> 05:23:19,440
Shawnee, here's noises.

6014
05:23:19,440 --> 05:23:21,440
Are they jorking it?

6015
05:23:21,440 --> 05:23:23,440
No sending.

6016
05:23:23,440 --> 05:23:25,440
Oh, come on, a little bit.

6017
05:23:29,440 --> 05:23:31,440
Okay, I won't do it.

6018
05:23:37,440 --> 05:23:39,440
No, punk!

6019
05:23:39,440 --> 05:23:41,440
You would have loved my puppy.

6020
05:23:41,440 --> 05:23:43,440
He was a real doofus, not but loved food walks

6021
05:23:43,440 --> 05:23:45,440
and sleeping his head.

6022
05:23:45,440 --> 05:23:47,440
Honestly, dogs are so cute.

6023
05:23:51,440 --> 05:23:53,440
Maybe looking at you are blind guys.

6024
05:23:55,440 --> 05:23:57,440
I just wish cats could communicate.

6025
05:23:57,440 --> 05:23:59,440
You have to guess what they want.

6026
05:23:59,440 --> 05:24:01,440
That's the only thing that I feel upset.

6027
05:24:03,440 --> 05:24:05,440
So, Gimli and Vigo were actually upset

6028
05:24:05,440 --> 05:24:07,440
my dad left because they got used to him being here.

6029
05:24:09,440 --> 05:24:11,440
And they were meowing.

6030
05:24:11,440 --> 05:24:13,440
And I knew they wanted dad,

6031
05:24:13,440 --> 05:24:15,440
but I was like...

6032
05:24:15,440 --> 05:24:17,440
I don't know how to explain to you,

6033
05:24:17,440 --> 05:24:19,440
but...

6034
05:24:19,440 --> 05:24:21,440
So, we're on this continent,

6035
05:24:21,440 --> 05:24:23,440
and he's in a different continent.

6036
05:24:23,440 --> 05:24:25,440
It's really far away, okay?

6037
05:24:25,440 --> 05:24:27,440
Really far away.

6038
05:24:31,440 --> 05:24:33,440
What? Is she...

6039
05:24:33,440 --> 05:24:35,440
Is she role-playing my hero academia or whatever?

6040
05:24:39,440 --> 05:24:41,440
What are you doing, young lady?

6041
05:24:49,440 --> 05:24:51,440
Little sister bullies you at school,

6042
05:24:51,440 --> 05:24:53,440
in front of all your friends

6043
05:24:53,440 --> 05:24:55,440
and humiliates you.

6044
05:24:55,440 --> 05:24:57,440
And then apologizes in private,

6045
05:24:57,440 --> 05:24:59,440
and then you kiss and make up.

6046
05:25:05,440 --> 05:25:07,440
Well, I'll keep that in mind for the

6047
05:25:07,440 --> 05:25:09,440
vealier package when it's her birthday.

6048
05:25:09,440 --> 05:25:11,440
Is that real?

6049
05:25:13,440 --> 05:25:15,440
I don't know what...

6050
05:25:15,440 --> 05:25:17,440
Right, if you guys can keep it a secret,

6051
05:25:17,440 --> 05:25:19,440
I know what artwork I'm going to order for her birthday.

6052
05:25:19,440 --> 05:25:21,440
But...

6053
05:25:21,440 --> 05:25:23,440
But can you keep it a secret?

6054
05:25:27,440 --> 05:25:29,440
I'll get her

6055
05:25:29,440 --> 05:25:31,440
in the cocktail

6056
05:25:31,440 --> 05:25:33,440
and Baku

6057
05:25:33,440 --> 05:25:35,440
and Deku

6058
05:25:35,440 --> 05:25:37,440
will be in a made-out

6059
05:25:37,440 --> 05:25:39,440
kissing like in that fucking

6060
05:25:39,440 --> 05:25:41,440
short that came out.

6061
05:25:41,440 --> 05:25:43,440
How do you feel about my hero academia?

6062
05:25:45,440 --> 05:25:47,440
I've watched

6063
05:25:47,440 --> 05:25:49,440
season

6064
05:25:49,440 --> 05:25:51,440
one

6065
05:25:51,440 --> 05:25:53,440
and two.

6066
05:25:53,440 --> 05:25:55,440
Froppy, obviously best girl

6067
05:25:55,440 --> 05:25:57,440
for no particular reason.

6068
05:25:57,440 --> 05:25:59,440
Loved me Froppy, simple as.

6069
05:26:01,440 --> 05:26:03,440
But

6070
05:26:03,440 --> 05:26:05,440
I never watched that other season.

6071
05:26:05,440 --> 05:26:07,440
Should love it, literally.

6072
05:26:09,440 --> 05:26:11,440
That artist that gets that request

6073
05:26:11,440 --> 05:26:13,440
is going to be like, what the...

6074
05:26:13,440 --> 05:26:15,440
I don't know.

6075
05:26:15,440 --> 05:26:17,440
The long tongue?

6076
05:26:17,440 --> 05:26:19,440
No, Froppy looks like me.

6077
05:26:19,440 --> 05:26:21,440
Well, a little bit.

6078
05:26:21,440 --> 05:26:23,440
I'm not exactly a fucking anime girl in real life,

6079
05:26:23,440 --> 05:26:25,440
let's be honest with you.

6080
05:26:25,440 --> 05:26:27,440
I'm no looker in real life, but

6081
05:26:27,440 --> 05:26:29,440
any design that looks remotely like me,

6082
05:26:29,440 --> 05:26:31,440
I'm like, oh my god, best girl.

6083
05:26:31,440 --> 05:26:33,440
Best girl, oh my god, black hair?

6084
05:26:33,440 --> 05:26:35,440
Best girl.

6085
05:26:35,440 --> 05:26:37,440
Long black hair?

6086
05:26:37,440 --> 05:26:39,440
Oh my god, me.

6087
05:26:39,440 --> 05:26:41,440
What's her name?

6088
05:26:41,440 --> 05:26:43,440
Um,

6089
05:26:43,440 --> 05:26:45,440
mommy loves the green ladies.

6090
05:26:45,440 --> 05:26:47,440
Yeah, green, green as well.

6091
05:26:47,440 --> 05:26:49,440
Green gang.

6092
05:26:49,440 --> 05:26:51,440
Oh, we got an instruction.

6093
05:26:55,440 --> 05:26:57,440
I should honestly probably pay a lot more

6094
05:26:57,440 --> 05:26:59,440
attention to this stream, because I'm going to be doing this

6095
05:26:59,440 --> 05:27:01,440
shortly. I don't know when, but...

6096
05:27:03,440 --> 05:27:05,440
I'm waiting for

6097
05:27:05,440 --> 05:27:07,440
my manicure and pedicure

6098
05:27:07,440 --> 05:27:09,440
to grow off of my fingernails and my toenails.

6099
05:27:09,440 --> 05:27:11,440
Cause, I refuse to go back

6100
05:27:11,440 --> 05:27:13,440
to pay money to get this taken off

6101
05:27:13,440 --> 05:27:15,440
and it's still growing out.

6102
05:27:15,440 --> 05:27:17,440
We'll read the Japanese bits for you.

6103
05:27:17,440 --> 05:27:19,440
Are you a weed, be honest?

6104
05:27:19,440 --> 05:27:21,440
Thank you.

6105
05:27:21,440 --> 05:27:23,440
Thank you for your, um,

6106
05:27:23,440 --> 05:27:25,440
your due diligence

6107
05:27:25,440 --> 05:27:27,440
to help me do what I need.

6108
05:27:27,440 --> 05:27:29,440
Handcam with your pet rat that you currently don't have.

6109
05:27:31,440 --> 05:27:33,440
I mean, I could do it on the floor

6110
05:27:33,440 --> 05:27:35,440
and Gimli and Vigo can just walk in the room

6111
05:27:35,440 --> 05:27:37,440
if they want, and I'll just call the stream

6112
05:27:37,440 --> 05:27:39,440
eh,

6113
05:27:39,440 --> 05:27:41,440
I mean

6114
05:27:41,440 --> 05:27:43,440
I just straight up copy Imi's

6115
05:27:43,440 --> 05:27:45,440
fucking stream.

6116
05:27:45,440 --> 05:27:47,440
Eh...

6117
05:27:47,440 --> 05:27:49,440
Eh...

6118
05:27:49,440 --> 05:27:51,440
How is your nails

6119
05:27:51,440 --> 05:27:53,440
perished in the great fires

6120
05:27:53,440 --> 05:27:55,440
in the great war of the Vietnamese

6121
05:27:55,440 --> 05:27:57,440
uh, nail

6122
05:27:57,440 --> 05:27:59,440
salon,

6123
05:27:59,440 --> 05:28:01,440
um,

6124
05:28:01,440 --> 05:28:03,440
knuckles the enchilado.

6125
05:28:03,440 --> 05:28:05,440
Long black hair, what's your thoughts

6126
05:28:05,440 --> 05:28:07,440
about braiding it in a one big braid?

6127
05:28:07,440 --> 05:28:09,440
Yeah, I know.

6128
05:28:09,440 --> 05:28:11,440
Uh, when

6129
05:28:11,440 --> 05:28:13,440
when your hair is really long

6130
05:28:13,440 --> 05:28:15,440
it's a lot easier to manage just keeping it

6131
05:28:15,440 --> 05:28:17,440
in a braid.

6132
05:28:17,440 --> 05:28:19,440
But, you're not to have any scalp tension

6133
05:28:19,440 --> 05:28:21,440
when you do the braid or that's really

6134
05:28:21,440 --> 05:28:23,440
bad for your, your, your scalp

6135
05:28:23,440 --> 05:28:25,440
hell.

6136
05:28:25,440 --> 05:28:27,440
Which is the only thing I didn't like about having long hair

6137
05:28:27,440 --> 05:28:29,440
but now that I have short hair I'm like

6138
05:28:29,440 --> 05:28:31,440
ugh, I'm regretting it.

6139
05:28:31,440 --> 05:28:33,440
I straight up regret it, bro.

6140
05:28:33,440 --> 05:28:35,440
But yeah, stream idea

6141
05:28:35,440 --> 05:28:37,440
yonked by Imi.

6142
05:28:37,440 --> 05:28:39,440
Yonking Imi's stream idea live.

6143
05:28:39,440 --> 05:28:41,440
Reve...

6144
05:28:41,440 --> 05:28:43,440
Knuckles the enchilado? What?

6145
05:28:43,440 --> 05:28:45,440
Reverse even spelled it right but it's trying to gift it.

6146
05:28:45,440 --> 05:28:47,440
Eh...

6147
05:28:47,440 --> 05:28:49,440
How's your elf a bull heal?

6148
05:28:49,440 --> 05:28:51,440
Yes, my toe is fully healed though.

6149
05:28:53,440 --> 05:28:55,440
Who? Get back here, was it Luna?

6150
05:28:57,440 --> 05:28:59,440
There's always Esteban

6151
05:28:59,440 --> 05:29:01,440
that was causing troubles on this one.

6152
05:29:03,440 --> 05:29:05,440
Pigtail braid.

6153
05:29:05,440 --> 05:29:07,440
Oh yeah, I love

6154
05:29:07,440 --> 05:29:09,440
pigtail braid.

6155
05:29:09,440 --> 05:29:11,440
Absolutely.

6156
05:29:11,440 --> 05:29:13,440
100%.

6157
05:29:13,440 --> 05:29:15,440
Any symmetrical

6158
05:29:15,440 --> 05:29:17,440
hair?

6159
05:29:17,440 --> 05:29:19,440
I love symmetrical

6160
05:29:19,440 --> 05:29:21,440
hair.

6161
05:29:21,440 --> 05:29:23,440
For me, symmetrical hair

6162
05:29:23,440 --> 05:29:25,440
is just peak design. Some sort of bunches

6163
05:29:25,440 --> 05:29:27,440
or anything of that nature

6164
05:29:27,440 --> 05:29:29,440
or ugh.

6165
05:29:29,440 --> 05:29:31,440
Fucking hell, where's she gone?

6166
05:29:31,440 --> 05:29:33,440
She's offline.

6167
05:29:33,440 --> 05:29:35,440
The ranks, the ranks.

6168
05:29:35,440 --> 05:29:37,440
The rats yonked the wires.

6169
05:29:37,440 --> 05:29:39,440
If you want to know what the rats

6170
05:29:39,440 --> 05:29:41,440
yonked the wires in one word would be

6171
05:29:41,440 --> 05:29:43,440
it would be the ranks.

6172
05:29:43,440 --> 05:29:45,440
Just so you know.

6173
05:29:45,440 --> 05:29:47,440
Eh...

6174
05:29:49,440 --> 05:29:51,440
Did it like reach over?

6175
05:29:53,440 --> 05:29:55,440
It has to be Esteban exactly.

6176
05:29:55,440 --> 05:29:57,440
Echidna is how it's supposed

6177
05:29:57,440 --> 05:29:59,440
is pronounced but spelled echid

6178
05:29:59,440 --> 05:30:01,440
oh.

6179
05:30:01,440 --> 05:30:03,440
Echidna.

6180
05:30:03,440 --> 05:30:05,440
Echidna?

6181
05:30:05,440 --> 05:30:07,440
Less than 9k winds to go.

6182
05:30:07,440 --> 05:30:09,440
How dare you outdo me.

6183
05:30:09,440 --> 05:30:11,440
Not you getting 99 before me.

6184
05:30:11,440 --> 05:30:13,440
This is embarrassing, come on.

6185
05:30:13,440 --> 05:30:15,440
I'm symmetrical.

6186
05:30:15,440 --> 05:30:17,440
That is so smart.

6187
05:30:17,440 --> 05:30:19,440
That is so fucking smart.

6188
05:30:19,440 --> 05:30:21,440
Sorry, that was so good.

6189
05:30:21,440 --> 05:30:23,440
So hair with hands

6190
05:30:23,440 --> 05:30:25,440
like bunches, pony tails

6191
05:30:25,440 --> 05:30:27,440
anything symmetrical

6192
05:30:27,440 --> 05:30:29,440
I'm here for, I love symmetry.

6193
05:30:29,440 --> 05:30:31,440
Like I love my hair so much

6194
05:30:31,440 --> 05:30:33,440
on my Vtuber model.

6195
05:30:33,440 --> 05:30:35,440
I just adore it.

6196
05:30:35,440 --> 05:30:37,440
Sorry, but literally double bunches

6197
05:30:37,440 --> 05:30:39,440
with all of this.

6198
05:30:39,440 --> 05:30:41,440
I just, oh my god you can't get better.

6199
05:30:41,440 --> 05:30:43,440
I love it, I love it, I love it.

6200
05:30:43,440 --> 05:30:45,440
I love for the symmetry.

6201
05:30:47,440 --> 05:30:49,440
Oh, is she like straight up eating on stream?

6202
05:30:49,440 --> 05:30:51,440
Harvarts.

6203
05:30:51,440 --> 05:30:53,440
Womash.

6204
05:30:53,440 --> 05:30:55,440
Avelts.

6205
05:30:55,440 --> 05:30:57,440
Hello.

6206
05:30:57,440 --> 05:30:59,440
Hi, little cutie.

6207
05:30:59,440 --> 05:31:01,440
Oh, it's already away with the cheese.

6208
05:31:01,440 --> 05:31:03,440
Come back for more cheese.

6209
05:31:03,440 --> 05:31:05,440
Emmy will give you more cheese if you come back on screen.

6210
05:31:13,440 --> 05:31:15,440
I have no idea what she...

6211
05:31:17,440 --> 05:31:19,440
She cut out the packaging.

6212
05:31:19,440 --> 05:31:21,440
It seems like the packaging has instructions on it.

6213
05:31:21,440 --> 05:31:23,440
And...

6214
05:31:25,440 --> 05:31:27,440
Ooh, I need fart again.

6215
05:31:31,440 --> 05:31:33,440
Oh, it was silent.

6216
05:31:33,440 --> 05:31:35,440
Silent.

6217
05:31:35,440 --> 05:31:37,440
Fun fact, a kitten's nose

6218
05:31:37,440 --> 05:31:39,440
or another mammal at least.

6219
05:31:39,440 --> 05:31:41,440
Wait, there's more than one of that platypus

6220
05:31:41,440 --> 05:31:43,440
with only the exception.

6221
05:31:43,440 --> 05:31:45,440
What coincidence.

6222
05:31:45,440 --> 05:31:47,440
I love Stony 2, wanna hang out?

6223
05:31:47,440 --> 05:31:49,440
What are the odds?

6224
05:31:49,440 --> 05:31:51,440
Harvart, like the ice cream.

6225
05:31:51,440 --> 05:31:53,440
There's my watamel in here.

6226
05:31:53,440 --> 05:31:55,440
Watamel.

6227
05:31:55,440 --> 05:31:57,440
Such a good name.

6228
05:31:57,440 --> 05:31:59,440
No more Touma, baby.

6229
05:31:59,440 --> 05:32:01,440
Only Watamel.

6230
05:32:01,440 --> 05:32:03,440
Oh, the wee rat.

6231
05:32:03,440 --> 05:32:05,440
Oh my God, it's so cute.

6232
05:32:05,440 --> 05:32:07,440
Oh my God.

6233
05:32:07,440 --> 05:32:09,440
Are you curious?

6234
05:32:15,440 --> 05:32:17,440
That's kind of true, Andrea.

6235
05:32:19,440 --> 05:32:21,440
Oh.

6236
05:32:21,440 --> 05:32:23,440
Oops.

6237
05:32:23,440 --> 05:32:25,440
Did she still try to take it?

6238
05:32:29,440 --> 05:32:31,440
Yoinked it.

6239
05:32:35,440 --> 05:32:37,440
That was such a good short that came out from these.

6240
05:32:37,440 --> 05:32:39,440
Oh!

6241
05:32:41,440 --> 05:32:43,440
No, look at it pulling.

6242
05:32:45,440 --> 05:32:47,440
No way.

6243
05:32:47,440 --> 05:32:49,440
No way.

6244
05:32:49,440 --> 05:32:51,440
Look how fast it was.

6245
05:32:51,440 --> 05:32:53,440
Oh my God.

6246
05:32:53,440 --> 05:32:55,440
The sweet back legs were going.

6247
05:32:57,440 --> 05:32:59,440
It's coming back for more.

6248
05:32:59,440 --> 05:33:01,440
Come on, give me something.

6249
05:33:01,440 --> 05:33:03,440
Don't take all of it away.

6250
05:33:03,440 --> 05:33:05,440
Amy's trying to stream.

6251
05:33:11,440 --> 05:33:13,440
Wait, you have to microwave it?

6252
05:33:13,440 --> 05:33:15,440
No.

6253
05:33:17,440 --> 05:33:19,440
Oh my God.

6254
05:33:21,440 --> 05:33:23,440
Rats are such wee guys, honestly.

6255
05:33:23,440 --> 05:33:25,440
I love how there was a piece of the box.

6256
05:33:25,440 --> 05:33:27,440
Like the one in her hand.

6257
05:33:27,440 --> 05:33:29,440
Honestly.

6258
05:33:29,440 --> 05:33:31,440
Rats are so cute.

6259
05:33:31,440 --> 05:33:33,440
Amy getting bullied by our rats live on stream.

6260
05:33:33,440 --> 05:33:35,440
I think that's what the highlight clip will be called.

6261
05:33:35,440 --> 05:33:37,440
Getting bullied by my rats on stream.

6262
05:33:37,440 --> 05:33:39,440
And then like the thumbnail will be her looking angry.

6263
05:33:39,440 --> 05:33:41,440
And then all our rats are like got little angel wings on.

6264
05:33:41,440 --> 05:33:43,440
And then all our rats are like got little angel wings on.

6265
05:33:43,440 --> 05:33:45,440
And uh,

6266
05:33:45,440 --> 05:33:47,440
like a halo to be like shown.

6267
05:33:47,440 --> 05:33:49,440
Oh no, we behave.

6268
05:33:49,440 --> 05:33:51,440
We're good.

6269
05:33:51,440 --> 05:33:53,440
But they're naughty.

6270
05:33:59,440 --> 05:34:01,440
Oh my God.

6271
05:34:01,440 --> 05:34:03,440
That literally she's having to bribe them

6272
05:34:03,440 --> 05:34:05,440
not to take her stuff.

6273
05:34:05,440 --> 05:34:07,440
They literally like you must pay

6274
05:34:07,440 --> 05:34:09,440
the toll and then they walk away again.

6275
05:34:09,440 --> 05:34:11,440
That's so precious.

6276
05:34:11,440 --> 05:34:13,440
Um,

6277
05:34:13,440 --> 05:34:15,440
there is a YouTube short,

6278
05:34:15,440 --> 05:34:17,440
but there isn't a highlight reel.

6279
05:34:19,440 --> 05:34:21,440
Oh, she's literally getting bribe by fucking rats.

6280
05:34:21,440 --> 05:34:23,440
Oh my God.

6281
05:34:23,440 --> 05:34:25,440
Oh, look at the way it skips backwards.

6282
05:34:27,440 --> 05:34:29,440
That's so cute.

6283
05:34:29,440 --> 05:34:31,440
Let's do a little butt shuffle away with it.

6284
05:34:31,440 --> 05:34:33,440
She literally extort.

6285
05:34:33,440 --> 05:34:35,440
She is being extorted live

6286
05:34:35,440 --> 05:34:37,440
by my rats highlight stream.

6287
05:34:41,440 --> 05:34:43,440
Oh, it's back for more.

6288
05:34:43,440 --> 05:34:45,440
No, no more.

6289
05:34:45,440 --> 05:34:47,440
Emmy's not got any more for you.

6290
05:34:47,440 --> 05:34:49,440
You've had like a full packet of cheese now.

6291
05:34:49,440 --> 05:34:51,440
A full cheese slice.

6292
05:34:51,440 --> 05:34:53,440
Our rats bottomless pits.

6293
05:34:53,440 --> 05:34:55,440
Do they not get full?

6294
05:34:59,440 --> 05:35:01,440
Hi Mercy, in the past.

6295
05:35:03,440 --> 05:35:05,440
What a glutton, honestly.

6296
05:35:05,440 --> 05:35:07,440
Oh,

6297
05:35:11,440 --> 05:35:13,440
naughty.

6298
05:35:13,440 --> 05:35:15,440
Naughty.

6299
05:35:15,440 --> 05:35:17,440
No, look how cute it is.

6300
05:35:17,440 --> 05:35:19,440
It's so elongated.

6301
05:35:19,440 --> 05:35:21,440
Such a long thing.

6302
05:35:25,440 --> 05:35:27,440
Give that spin back.

6303
05:35:29,440 --> 05:35:31,440
Give it back.

6304
05:35:31,440 --> 05:35:33,440
Oh my God.

6305
05:35:33,440 --> 05:35:35,440
This is so cute.

6306
05:35:35,440 --> 05:35:37,440
I'll smile an ear to ear.

6307
05:35:37,440 --> 05:35:39,440
Oh, please.

6308
05:35:39,440 --> 05:35:41,440
We need another rat stream stream.

6309
05:35:41,440 --> 05:35:43,440
I don't know what it will be.

6310
05:35:43,440 --> 05:35:45,440
But it's so cute.

6311
05:35:45,440 --> 05:35:47,440
I can't handle it.

6312
05:35:51,440 --> 05:35:53,440
Okay, BRB.

6313
05:35:55,440 --> 05:35:57,440
Bruh.

6314
05:35:57,440 --> 05:35:59,440
It's so cute.

6315
05:35:59,440 --> 05:36:01,440
I've never known someone with rats before.

6316
05:36:01,440 --> 05:36:03,440
Not like a primary school friend.

6317
05:36:03,440 --> 05:36:05,440
What are you doing?

6318
05:36:05,440 --> 05:36:07,440
It's unattended.

6319
05:36:07,440 --> 05:36:09,440
Pin pals, you have to look after the rat.

6320
05:36:11,440 --> 05:36:13,440
Pin pals, you need to tell them off.

6321
05:36:15,440 --> 05:36:17,440
Or her off even.

6322
05:36:21,440 --> 05:36:23,440
Oh, what is it going to do on its own?

6323
05:36:25,440 --> 05:36:27,440
What's she doing?

6324
05:36:27,440 --> 05:36:29,440
Oh my God, I'm adoring this.

6325
05:36:29,440 --> 05:36:31,440
I literally feel like I'm babysitting,

6326
05:36:31,440 --> 05:36:33,440
but I can't do anything.

6327
05:36:33,440 --> 05:36:35,440
Don't chew the wires on the headset.

6328
05:36:35,440 --> 05:36:37,440
Emmy told me that they chew her

6329
05:36:37,440 --> 05:36:39,440
wires so much.

6330
05:36:41,440 --> 05:36:43,440
I assume animals don't ever stop eating.

6331
05:36:43,440 --> 05:36:45,440
It's just an instinct.

6332
05:36:45,440 --> 05:36:47,440
Possibly grazing animals type thing.

6333
05:36:49,440 --> 05:36:51,440
Cuteness overload.

6334
05:36:51,440 --> 05:36:53,440
Esteban's sneaking in while she's doing it.

6335
05:36:53,440 --> 05:36:55,440
Literally. Is that Esteban?

6336
05:36:55,440 --> 05:36:57,440
That's that one.

6337
05:36:57,440 --> 05:36:59,440
I'm rubbish with the names.

6338
05:36:59,440 --> 05:37:01,440
I know Lunam is that kind of pale looking one.

6339
05:37:01,440 --> 05:37:03,440
Hi Esteban.

6340
05:37:03,440 --> 05:37:05,440
You got a little...

6341
05:37:05,440 --> 05:37:07,440
Oh, look at it going on its meatback legs.

6342
05:37:21,440 --> 05:37:23,440
Oh my God, it's supposed to be cute.

6343
05:37:23,440 --> 05:37:25,440
They are gnawing.

6344
05:37:25,440 --> 05:37:27,440
I'm gnawing a gnaw.

6345
05:37:27,440 --> 05:37:29,440
Esteban stole her headphones,

6346
05:37:29,440 --> 05:37:31,440
literally walking away with them.

6347
05:37:33,440 --> 05:37:35,440
Why didn't play that game?

6348
05:37:39,440 --> 05:37:41,440
That's funny.

6349
05:37:47,440 --> 05:37:49,440
Donkey Kong reference

6350
05:37:49,440 --> 05:37:51,440
to

6351
05:37:51,440 --> 05:37:53,440
Waitin' Brune.

6352
05:37:53,440 --> 05:37:55,440
Esteban, the noisiest one.

6353
05:37:57,440 --> 05:37:59,440
You can have a sniff of the powder,

6354
05:37:59,440 --> 05:38:01,440
but you're not allowed to...

6355
05:38:03,440 --> 05:38:05,440
Yeah, that's right.

6356
05:38:05,440 --> 05:38:07,440
Trying to fight her, but she got that grip.

6357
05:38:07,440 --> 05:38:09,440
Get wrecked. Get wrecked, Esteban.

6358
05:38:09,440 --> 05:38:11,440
Time for a pet. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6359
05:38:11,440 --> 05:38:13,440
Get a pet. Get a pet. Get a pet. Get a pet.

6360
05:38:15,440 --> 05:38:17,440
Honestly, that must be...

6361
05:38:17,440 --> 05:38:19,440
Fucking circle the rune!

6362
05:38:21,440 --> 05:38:23,440
Chaos, Esteban.

6363
05:38:23,440 --> 05:38:25,440
Chaos, how dare you?

6364
05:38:27,440 --> 05:38:29,440
Tune through it.

6365
05:38:29,440 --> 05:38:31,440
I got my first card today, by the way.

6366
05:38:31,440 --> 05:38:33,440
Congrats!

6367
05:38:33,440 --> 05:38:35,440
Is it Binance?

6368
05:38:35,440 --> 05:38:37,440
Or did you pay cash?

6369
05:38:37,440 --> 05:38:39,440
And is it Second Hand?

6370
05:38:43,440 --> 05:38:45,440
Ooh, we're on 18,000.

6371
05:38:45,440 --> 05:38:47,440
Can we do it?

6372
05:38:47,440 --> 05:38:49,440
What are we at?

6373
05:38:49,440 --> 05:38:51,440
Oh, my...

6374
05:38:51,440 --> 05:38:53,440
Okay, so it says I've been streaming for 30 minutes

6375
05:38:53,440 --> 05:38:55,440
because my OBS crashed,

6376
05:38:55,440 --> 05:38:57,440
so I don't actually know.

6377
05:38:59,440 --> 05:39:01,440
Donkey Kong versus King Kong, who I am...

6378
05:39:01,440 --> 05:39:03,440
Isn't King Kong, like, massive

6379
05:39:03,440 --> 05:39:05,440
and Donkey Kong's, like, two feet off the ground?

6380
05:39:07,440 --> 05:39:09,440
Almost six hours, almost five.

6381
05:39:09,440 --> 05:39:11,440
Okay.

6382
05:39:11,440 --> 05:39:13,440
Sugar. Nah, we can't do it then.

6383
05:39:13,440 --> 05:39:15,440
I was 30k at the start,

6384
05:39:15,440 --> 05:39:17,440
but it's taken me six hours

6385
05:39:17,440 --> 05:39:19,440
to get to thingy.

6386
05:39:19,440 --> 05:39:21,440
Then I need, like, another

6387
05:39:21,440 --> 05:39:23,440
what, couple of hours stream.

6388
05:39:25,440 --> 05:39:27,440
You have been streaming for...

6389
05:39:29,440 --> 05:39:31,440
I'm going to be shy.

6390
05:39:31,440 --> 05:39:33,440
Okay, there's going to be one more runescape stream,

6391
05:39:33,440 --> 05:39:35,440
but I'll do it, as I said.

6392
05:39:35,440 --> 05:39:37,440
I'm going to do a finishing

6393
05:39:37,440 --> 05:39:39,440
up stream where I'll play

6394
05:39:39,440 --> 05:39:41,440
the three games. I'll play a finished Sonic Heroes.

6395
05:39:41,440 --> 05:39:43,440
I'll finish

6396
05:39:43,440 --> 05:39:45,440
a runescape

6397
05:39:45,440 --> 05:39:47,440
and then I'll finish a little to the left DLC

6398
05:39:47,440 --> 05:39:49,440
because I missed that, apparently.

6399
05:39:49,440 --> 05:39:51,440
And I really enjoyed that game, seriously.

6400
05:39:55,440 --> 05:39:57,440
Other than that one refrigerator one.

6401
05:40:01,440 --> 05:40:03,440
What did I miss? No!

6402
05:40:03,440 --> 05:40:05,440
I should take it.

6403
05:40:05,440 --> 05:40:07,440
What did she take?

6404
05:40:11,440 --> 05:40:13,440
It's hers now.

6405
05:40:16,440 --> 05:40:18,440
No!

6406
05:40:22,440 --> 05:40:24,440
Oh, Blizzard.

6407
05:40:28,440 --> 05:40:30,440
Her face going straight.

6408
05:40:33,440 --> 05:40:35,440
No!

6409
05:40:35,440 --> 05:40:37,440
No!

6410
05:40:45,440 --> 05:40:47,440
The powder plunge everywhere.

6411
05:40:47,440 --> 05:40:49,440
Okay, okay, okay.

6412
05:40:49,440 --> 05:40:51,440
How can she make the crumbs

6413
05:40:51,440 --> 05:40:53,440
in the towel?

6414
05:40:53,440 --> 05:40:55,440
No! Not her trying to pick up the crumbs!

6415
05:40:55,440 --> 05:40:57,440
No!

6416
05:40:57,440 --> 05:40:59,440
Amy, darling!

6417
05:40:59,440 --> 05:41:01,440
She's trying to pick up the crumbs!

6418
05:41:01,440 --> 05:41:03,440
That's hilarious!

6419
05:41:05,440 --> 05:41:07,440
Oh, Amy!

6420
05:41:07,440 --> 05:41:09,440
Oh, Amy, no!

6421
05:41:13,440 --> 05:41:15,440
A ledge!

6422
05:41:15,440 --> 05:41:17,440
Oh, pervy, Amy!

6423
05:41:17,440 --> 05:41:19,440
That's hilarious, sorry.

6424
05:41:19,440 --> 05:41:21,440
That's funny as anything.

6425
05:41:25,440 --> 05:41:27,440
Pablo Escobar, that shit?

6426
05:41:27,440 --> 05:41:29,440
That's my only suggestion

6427
05:41:29,440 --> 05:41:31,440
if you want to clean it quick.

6428
05:41:35,440 --> 05:41:37,440
What?

6429
05:41:41,440 --> 05:41:43,440
Her Amy.

6430
05:41:43,440 --> 05:41:45,440
Trying to save them salvageable.

6431
05:41:45,440 --> 05:41:47,440
Is she licking the crumbs?

6432
05:41:47,440 --> 05:41:49,440
Esteban!

6433
05:41:53,440 --> 05:41:55,440
Yes, Esteban.

6434
05:41:55,440 --> 05:41:57,440
No way!

6435
05:41:57,440 --> 05:41:59,440
No way she prepared a lane

6436
05:41:59,440 --> 05:42:01,440
for her rack!

6437
05:42:01,440 --> 05:42:03,440
Come on, Amy!

6438
05:42:05,440 --> 05:42:07,440
Amy!

6439
05:42:07,440 --> 05:42:09,440
This is fucking amazing!

6440
05:42:11,440 --> 05:42:13,440
Oh, a ledge.

6441
05:42:15,440 --> 05:42:17,440
Literally.

6442
05:42:19,440 --> 05:42:21,440
Stony encourage in the Colombians?

6443
05:42:21,440 --> 05:42:23,440
No.

6444
05:42:23,440 --> 05:42:25,440
It's really weird the effect, the drug.

6445
05:42:25,440 --> 05:42:27,440
It gives you an ego, it gives you confidence

6446
05:42:27,440 --> 05:42:29,440
out of nowhere, which is bizarre.

6447
05:42:29,440 --> 05:42:31,440
I'd really love to do a drugs talk stream.

6448
05:42:31,440 --> 05:42:33,440
I love it.

6449
05:42:33,440 --> 05:42:35,440
I love me drugs.

6450
05:42:35,440 --> 05:42:37,440
Education, I don't actually do anything.

6451
05:42:39,440 --> 05:42:41,440
My drug is you, refling.

6452
05:42:43,440 --> 05:42:45,440
Smooth, huh?

6453
05:42:45,440 --> 05:42:47,440
Just like my...

6454
05:42:47,440 --> 05:42:49,440
My class.

6455
05:42:51,440 --> 05:42:53,440
My little sister is the one that cooks.

6456
05:42:53,440 --> 05:42:55,440
You know, Amy would make a stupid money in a trap.

6457
05:42:55,440 --> 05:42:57,440
Whoa!

6458
05:42:57,440 --> 05:42:59,440
Hold on a minute, is that what I think that is?

6459
05:42:59,440 --> 05:43:01,440
I think that's an American terminology,

6460
05:43:01,440 --> 05:43:03,440
but I think I know what it means.

6461
05:43:05,440 --> 05:43:07,440
You should get up

6462
05:43:07,440 --> 05:43:09,440
to right before 999 off stream

6463
05:43:09,440 --> 05:43:11,440
so you can do a big stream celebration 999 party.

6464
05:43:11,440 --> 05:43:13,440
I don't know how...

6465
05:43:13,440 --> 05:43:15,440
I know this sounds bizarre,

6466
05:43:15,440 --> 05:43:17,440
but like...

6467
05:43:17,440 --> 05:43:19,440
isn't the celebration just

6468
05:43:19,440 --> 05:43:21,440
acts in the chat?

6469
05:43:23,440 --> 05:43:25,440
I was gonna do

6470
05:43:25,440 --> 05:43:27,440
a repair stream.

6471
05:43:27,440 --> 05:43:29,440
Like, I finish off games, I've not finished.

6472
05:43:29,440 --> 05:43:31,440
My drug is Stony Typnosis.

6473
05:43:31,440 --> 05:43:33,440
Stony Grains, reflans up and snort something.

6474
05:43:33,440 --> 05:43:35,440
I would do no such thing

6475
05:43:35,440 --> 05:43:37,440
to my darlings.

6476
05:43:37,440 --> 05:43:39,440
If anything, I'd extract the ink

6477
05:43:39,440 --> 05:43:41,440
and then powderize it

6478
05:43:41,440 --> 05:43:43,440
and then

6479
05:43:43,440 --> 05:43:45,440
snort it.

6480
05:43:45,440 --> 05:43:47,440
That's what I would do.

6481
05:43:47,440 --> 05:43:49,440
If you're asking my honest opinion, that's what I would do.

6482
05:43:53,440 --> 05:43:55,440
Oh, well, you can...

6483
05:43:55,440 --> 05:43:57,440
Oh, and...

6484
05:43:57,440 --> 05:43:59,440
Oh, she's making it worse.

6485
05:43:59,440 --> 05:44:01,440
Oh, my little sister,

6486
05:44:01,440 --> 05:44:03,440
she's making it worse.

6487
05:44:03,440 --> 05:44:05,440
Oh, no.

6488
05:44:07,440 --> 05:44:09,440
Oh, she's smi...

6489
05:44:09,440 --> 05:44:11,440
Oh, you're...

6490
05:44:11,440 --> 05:44:13,440
No, you're so...

6491
05:44:13,440 --> 05:44:15,440
darlin'.

6492
05:44:15,440 --> 05:44:17,440
You're rubbin' it in, you know?

6493
05:44:19,440 --> 05:44:21,440
A real...

6494
05:44:21,440 --> 05:44:23,440
I actually reeled off that one.

6495
05:44:23,440 --> 05:44:25,440
Like, preach that one again and made for me.

6496
05:44:25,440 --> 05:44:27,440
Maybe...

6497
05:44:27,440 --> 05:44:29,440
a-stained.

6498
05:44:33,440 --> 05:44:35,440
Oh!

6499
05:44:35,440 --> 05:44:37,440
I think I've ever...

6500
05:44:37,440 --> 05:44:39,440
That's...

6501
05:44:43,440 --> 05:44:45,440
God, we're already almost at 17,000.

6502
05:44:45,440 --> 05:44:47,440
It looks like a...

6503
05:44:47,440 --> 05:44:49,440
It literally looks like a skid mark.

6504
05:44:49,440 --> 05:44:51,440
You're...

6505
05:44:51,440 --> 05:44:53,440
You're Ray. Oh, my God, she's trying to hate it with a cotton board.

6506
05:44:53,440 --> 05:44:55,440
That's adorable.

6507
05:44:59,440 --> 05:45:01,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6508
05:45:03,440 --> 05:45:05,440
Exactly.

6509
05:45:19,440 --> 05:45:21,440
Yes.

6510
05:45:21,440 --> 05:45:23,440
True P'tan.

6511
05:45:23,440 --> 05:45:25,440
Design-wise, AC actually has

6512
05:45:25,440 --> 05:45:27,440
slight bit of meat.

6513
05:45:27,440 --> 05:45:29,440
Design-wise, Amy is True P'tan.

6514
05:45:31,440 --> 05:45:33,440
Hi, it's Saban.

6515
05:45:39,440 --> 05:45:41,440
I've a love of a daughter, girl, failure.

6516
05:45:43,440 --> 05:45:45,440
We saw the pics of the DMA, we know the truth.

6517
05:45:47,440 --> 05:45:49,440
Bruh, that clip blew up of her.

6518
05:45:49,440 --> 05:45:51,440
I'm so glad.

6519
05:45:51,440 --> 05:45:53,440
It threw her head again further, and I'm like, thank...

6520
05:45:53,440 --> 05:45:55,440
She's almost at 20k subs, which is amazing.

6521
05:45:55,440 --> 05:45:57,440
And Mercy's almost at 10k as well.

6522
05:45:57,440 --> 05:45:59,440
And I'm like...

6523
05:46:05,440 --> 05:46:07,440
She has to come back

6524
05:46:07,440 --> 05:46:09,440
and identify what's missing

6525
05:46:09,440 --> 05:46:11,440
before she continues the stream.

6526
05:46:13,440 --> 05:46:15,440
That's perfect.

6527
05:46:15,440 --> 05:46:17,440
Ooh, 227.

6528
05:46:17,440 --> 05:46:19,440
227 and we're at 96.

6529
05:46:27,440 --> 05:46:29,440
This is doing numbers.

6530
05:46:29,440 --> 05:46:31,440
Literally, this is doing numbers

6531
05:46:31,440 --> 05:46:33,440
at a clip, because it was!

6532
05:46:33,440 --> 05:46:35,440
It's like, last time I checked it,

6533
05:46:35,440 --> 05:46:37,440
it was like 100,000 people

6534
05:46:37,440 --> 05:46:39,440
had seen my little sister's

6535
05:46:39,440 --> 05:46:41,440
fucking chest.

6536
05:46:41,440 --> 05:46:43,440
Going on here.

6537
05:46:43,440 --> 05:46:45,440
Dear Algorithm,

6538
05:46:45,440 --> 05:46:47,440
please continue to bless the girls.

6539
05:46:47,440 --> 05:46:49,440
Seriously, bless them.

6540
05:46:49,440 --> 05:46:51,440
You're about to hit 18,000 too.

6541
05:46:51,440 --> 05:46:53,440
Just in time to

6542
05:46:53,440 --> 05:46:55,440
corrupt 18,000 people

6543
05:46:55,440 --> 05:46:57,440
and try and convince them

6544
05:46:57,440 --> 05:46:59,440
to click on pregnant with you, ASMR.

6545
05:46:59,440 --> 05:47:01,440
Oh, it's all coming together.

6546
05:47:01,440 --> 05:47:03,440
Oh, yeah.

6547
05:47:05,440 --> 05:47:07,440
She posted a sweater pic

6548
05:47:07,440 --> 05:47:09,440
without a...

6549
05:47:09,440 --> 05:47:11,440
I know, I saw it.

6550
05:47:11,440 --> 05:47:13,440
I look after my little sister.

6551
05:47:13,440 --> 05:47:15,440
She just doesn't know

6552
05:47:15,440 --> 05:47:17,440
how much I look into her.

6553
05:47:17,440 --> 05:47:19,440
I don't think any of them realize

6554
05:47:19,440 --> 05:47:21,440
how much I keep up with them

6555
05:47:21,440 --> 05:47:23,440
as best I can.

6556
05:47:23,440 --> 05:47:25,440
Because they probably are like,

6557
05:47:25,440 --> 05:47:27,440
aw, strong streams all day.

6558
05:47:27,440 --> 05:47:29,440
There's no way she can stream and then do all the behind the scenes work

6559
05:47:29,440 --> 05:47:31,440
and then do all the work she does for the reflins

6560
05:47:31,440 --> 05:47:33,440
and then do all the secret stuff that isn't even out yet

6561
05:47:33,440 --> 05:47:35,440
and keep up with us.

6562
05:47:35,440 --> 05:47:37,440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

6563
05:47:42,440 --> 05:47:44,440
I haven't slept eight ever since

6564
05:47:44,440 --> 05:47:46,440
pre-debut.

6565
05:47:46,440 --> 05:47:48,440
I have.

6566
05:47:48,440 --> 05:47:50,440
I have slept eight hours at one point,

6567
05:47:50,440 --> 05:47:52,440
but I haven't slept a full eight hours

6568
05:47:52,440 --> 05:47:54,440
in a very long time.

6569
05:47:55,440 --> 05:47:57,440
I'm not sure, though.

6570
05:47:57,440 --> 05:47:59,440
The diddly boy.

6571
05:47:59,440 --> 05:48:01,440
Well, think, by the way, so

6572
05:48:01,440 --> 05:48:03,440
say a clip about how short can be

6573
05:48:03,440 --> 05:48:05,440
used to expose for Algo to Workbear.

6574
05:48:05,440 --> 05:48:07,440
Something, something, leave the checkbox for information

6575
05:48:07,440 --> 05:48:09,440
so that he's like, jumped off of me,

6576
05:48:09,440 --> 05:48:11,440
and tells Algo, oh, I didn't know.

6577
05:48:13,440 --> 05:48:15,440
I'm seeing how the shorts do

6578
05:48:15,440 --> 05:48:17,440
growth-wise on the channels.

6579
05:48:17,440 --> 05:48:19,440
Obviously, we've only just got the short people in place.

6580
05:48:19,440 --> 05:48:21,440
Like, Sheevee, for example,

6581
05:48:23,440 --> 05:48:25,440
here, I'm about to spank you on Sheevee's behalf.

6582
05:48:25,440 --> 05:48:27,440
I'm needing you to help Sheevee with clips

6583
05:48:27,440 --> 05:48:29,440
for like funny moments, because she has

6584
05:48:29,440 --> 05:48:31,440
two Elden Ring clips out with

6585
05:48:31,440 --> 05:48:33,440
the pre-recorded stuff and I'm like,

6586
05:48:33,440 --> 05:48:35,440
I'm gonna need you guys to help Sheevee

6587
05:48:35,440 --> 05:48:37,440
so she can give me these shorts.

6588
05:48:39,440 --> 05:48:41,440
Yeah.

6589
05:48:43,440 --> 05:48:45,440
But, Reeflings, you guys are pulling

6590
05:48:45,440 --> 05:48:47,440
in all the work where the clips are.

6591
05:48:47,440 --> 05:48:49,440
Let's just say Arisa,

6592
05:48:49,440 --> 05:48:51,440
my clip editor, she is

6593
05:48:51,440 --> 05:48:53,440
eating good, okay?

6594
05:48:53,440 --> 05:48:55,440
She's eating good. You guys are doing

6595
05:48:55,440 --> 05:48:57,440
fantastic work for Arisa,

6596
05:48:57,440 --> 05:48:59,440
and she's so, she's so fun to work

6597
05:48:59,440 --> 05:49:01,440
with, like, she just comes out,

6598
05:49:01,440 --> 05:49:03,440
she like, honestly is just fantastic.

6599
05:49:03,440 --> 05:49:05,440
Trying to get her to sleep for a full week challenge

6600
05:49:05,440 --> 05:49:07,440
impossible, literally.

6601
05:49:07,440 --> 05:49:09,440
Oh, wait, that's me spanking the hair.

6602
05:49:09,440 --> 05:49:11,440
I'm real true. 4K.

6603
05:49:11,440 --> 05:49:13,440
Hold on.

6604
05:49:25,440 --> 05:49:27,440
Reeflings, we need to help Mummy pass.

6605
05:49:27,440 --> 05:49:29,440
You know what to do.

6606
05:49:29,440 --> 05:49:31,440
Short people. It sounds weird,

6607
05:49:31,440 --> 05:49:33,440
but it's called YouTube Shorts because

6608
05:49:33,440 --> 05:49:35,440
it's short form content.

6609
05:49:35,440 --> 05:49:37,440
Reeflings called her Mummy

6610
05:49:37,440 --> 05:49:39,440
at E.P.

6611
05:49:39,440 --> 05:49:41,440
Bro, literally I've never been so

6612
05:49:41,440 --> 05:49:43,440
had so many

6613
05:49:43,440 --> 05:49:45,440
loaf of bread issues in my life,

6614
05:49:45,440 --> 05:49:47,440
but I've just completely

6615
05:49:47,440 --> 05:49:49,440
forgotten, like, how to

6616
05:49:49,440 --> 05:49:51,440
hydrate, and speaking of hydration,

6617
05:49:51,440 --> 05:49:53,440
let's all hydrate with some water, okay?

6618
05:49:53,440 --> 05:49:55,440
Can't do VOD

6619
05:49:55,440 --> 05:49:57,440
watch-alongs more often, just to keep up

6620
05:49:57,440 --> 05:49:59,440
with my daughters.

6621
05:50:01,440 --> 05:50:03,440
Like, I knew Sheepsters

6622
05:50:03,440 --> 05:50:05,440
was collabing with

6623
05:50:05,440 --> 05:50:07,440
this French rabbit.

6624
05:50:07,440 --> 05:50:09,440
Me too, but I'm like, oh fuck yeah,

6625
05:50:09,440 --> 05:50:11,440
Viva la France, mate.

6626
05:50:11,440 --> 05:50:13,440
And it was like a hoot in a holler.

6627
05:50:13,440 --> 05:50:15,440
I got to lurk that for a little bit.

6628
05:50:15,440 --> 05:50:17,440
Yeah,

6629
05:50:17,440 --> 05:50:19,440
some

6630
05:50:19,440 --> 05:50:21,440
Reeflings should just start dogpiling over Mummy.

6631
05:50:21,440 --> 05:50:23,440
Does lemon and leek

6632
05:50:23,440 --> 05:50:25,440
count as hydration? It does.

6633
05:50:25,440 --> 05:50:27,440
Tea does have hydrating properties,

6634
05:50:27,440 --> 05:50:29,440
but it's also a diuretic because of the caffeine

6635
05:50:29,440 --> 05:50:31,440
or something like that, which means it wants you to pee.

6636
05:50:31,440 --> 05:50:33,440
It feels like you need to pee.

6637
05:50:33,440 --> 05:50:35,440
Oh my god, he's only got one health!

6638
05:50:35,440 --> 05:50:37,440
Beat him up! Beat him up!

6639
05:50:37,440 --> 05:50:39,440
Oh, he's, he's putting...

6640
05:50:39,440 --> 05:50:41,440
Who's he getting beaten up by?

6641
05:50:41,440 --> 05:50:43,440
Who slayed this poor beast?

6642
05:50:43,440 --> 05:50:45,440
It has gone. The beast has been slain.

6643
05:50:55,440 --> 05:50:57,440
Damn!

6644
05:50:57,440 --> 05:50:59,440
That collab is so funny.

6645
05:50:59,440 --> 05:51:01,440
This has come to every family with more of this stuff.

6646
05:51:01,440 --> 05:51:03,440
It's only really possible because of RuneScape.

6647
05:51:03,440 --> 05:51:05,440
I don't really play any games

6648
05:51:05,440 --> 05:51:07,440
that aren't like super mega

6649
05:51:07,440 --> 05:51:09,440
and non-engaging.

6650
05:51:21,440 --> 05:51:23,440
Hi, Esteban!

6651
05:51:25,440 --> 05:51:27,440
Oh my god, look at the

6652
05:51:27,440 --> 05:51:29,440
fucking reach!

6653
05:51:29,440 --> 05:51:31,440
The rats are so long!

6654
05:51:31,440 --> 05:51:33,440
Honestly, they're like long, long critters.

6655
05:51:35,440 --> 05:51:37,440
A little broasted, I think I'm drinking too much of it

6656
05:51:37,440 --> 05:51:39,440
because

6657
05:51:39,440 --> 05:51:41,440
the mouth got that sort of dry after doing it.

6658
05:51:43,440 --> 05:51:45,440
Sadly, the vodka doesn't exist for that.

6659
05:51:45,440 --> 05:51:47,440
Oh, did it have to go?

6660
05:51:47,440 --> 05:51:49,440
I'm actually spanking the girls

6661
05:51:49,440 --> 05:51:51,440
in the meeting. I'm going to be like,

6662
05:51:51,440 --> 05:51:53,440
you need to stop doing stuff that

6663
05:51:53,440 --> 05:51:55,440
um...

6664
05:51:55,440 --> 05:51:57,440
Oh my god, it's a chef's hat,

6665
05:51:57,440 --> 05:51:59,440
but I have a golden chef's hat

6666
05:51:59,440 --> 05:52:01,440
because I have so energy for it.

6667
05:52:01,440 --> 05:52:03,440
And look, I've got a reflin on my shoulder.

6668
05:52:03,440 --> 05:52:05,440
Look at that.

6669
05:52:05,440 --> 05:52:07,440
Look at that lore.

6670
05:52:07,440 --> 05:52:09,440
It's a little more accurate, honestly.

6671
05:52:09,440 --> 05:52:11,440
I hope the meeting goes, ah, it's fine.

6672
05:52:13,440 --> 05:52:15,440
The meetings are really easy.

6673
05:52:15,440 --> 05:52:17,440
I'm basically just going to be like,

6674
05:52:17,440 --> 05:52:19,440
can we ease up on the DMCA

6675
05:52:19,440 --> 05:52:21,440
and the copyright streams

6676
05:52:21,440 --> 05:52:23,440
or the streams that need to be taken down all the time

6677
05:52:23,440 --> 05:52:25,440
because we're entering, like,

6678
05:52:25,440 --> 05:52:27,440
our third month of streaming together.

6679
05:52:27,440 --> 05:52:29,440
Like, we're about to complete the second month,

6680
05:52:29,440 --> 05:52:31,440
we're about to enter the third month

6681
05:52:31,440 --> 05:52:33,440
and everyone's full-time content creators,

6682
05:52:33,440 --> 05:52:35,440
but some channels do not look like

6683
05:52:35,440 --> 05:52:37,440
they're full-time content creators

6684
05:52:37,440 --> 05:52:39,440
because they're having to, like, pull down vods all the time

6685
05:52:39,440 --> 05:52:41,440
and I'm like, if we could ease up on that,

6686
05:52:41,440 --> 05:52:43,440
that'd be grand type thing.

6687
05:52:43,440 --> 05:52:45,440
Is there a cutlery or a squid pet?

6688
05:52:47,440 --> 05:52:49,440
There's, like, some sort of water one,

6689
05:52:49,440 --> 05:52:51,440
but, you know...

6690
05:52:51,440 --> 05:52:53,440
We want to have more vods stay up, basically.

6691
05:52:55,440 --> 05:52:57,440
Simple serips that could make for a fizzy juice?

6692
05:52:59,440 --> 05:53:01,440
Like, a dilute...

6693
05:53:01,440 --> 05:53:03,440
orange...

6694
05:53:03,440 --> 05:53:05,440
wobbly.

6695
05:53:05,440 --> 05:53:07,440
YouTube is restrictive and it's not getting better.

6696
05:53:07,440 --> 05:53:09,440
No, it's getting worse, literally.

6697
05:53:09,440 --> 05:53:11,440
I'm so shocked at the ear-licking update.

6698
05:53:11,440 --> 05:53:13,440
They've no said anything about it publicly,

6699
05:53:13,440 --> 05:53:15,440
but it's getting scary, like...

6700
05:53:17,440 --> 05:53:19,440
I want to- I'll probably be eating

6701
05:53:19,440 --> 05:53:21,440
my words in what, a year's time

6702
05:53:21,440 --> 05:53:23,440
when there's a new policy update,

6703
05:53:23,440 --> 05:53:25,440
but I want to say they're not going to get any more restrictive

6704
05:53:25,440 --> 05:53:27,440
when it comes to ASMR because that-

6705
05:53:27,440 --> 05:53:29,440
that was a bit much after that.

6706
05:53:35,440 --> 05:53:37,440
It means me!

6707
05:53:37,440 --> 05:53:39,440
Me, Emmy, I'm an architect!

6708
05:53:45,440 --> 05:53:47,440
Once you have access

6709
05:53:47,440 --> 05:53:49,440
to alternative outlet on BlueSight,

6710
05:53:49,440 --> 05:53:51,440
they may be able to have a bit of camera on YouTube.

6711
05:53:51,440 --> 05:53:53,440
They'll be able to get all their

6712
05:53:53,440 --> 05:53:55,440
all their pent-up energy out.

6713
05:53:59,440 --> 05:54:01,440
Educate her mumma.

6714
05:54:01,440 --> 05:54:03,440
Oh, well!

6715
05:54:03,440 --> 05:54:05,440
She guessed it.

6716
05:54:07,440 --> 05:54:09,440
She guessed it, no way!

6717
05:54:09,440 --> 05:54:11,440
Or did someone tell her? Did I pin pal tell her?

6718
05:54:17,440 --> 05:54:19,440
I lack them big!

6719
05:54:19,440 --> 05:54:21,440
I lack them chunky!

6720
05:54:25,440 --> 05:54:27,440
Of course, Ronny would know what that means.

6721
05:54:31,440 --> 05:54:33,440
Thank you, the shit! You're not even the fart!

6722
05:54:33,440 --> 05:54:35,440
Ah, so I'm getting Emmy to cover that song.

6723
05:54:35,440 --> 05:54:37,440
Happy going hard!

6724
05:54:37,440 --> 05:54:39,440
They break in their hearts!

6725
05:54:41,440 --> 05:54:43,440
This girl's thick, but I'm thicker!

6726
05:54:43,440 --> 05:54:45,440
I don't know.

6727
05:54:47,440 --> 05:54:49,440
Child friendly for the beach.

6728
05:54:51,440 --> 05:54:53,440
Yeah, the fake Elsa stuff was hilarious.

6729
05:54:53,440 --> 05:54:55,440
Cause apparently it was like this really big

6730
05:54:55,440 --> 05:54:57,440
YouTuber.

6731
05:54:57,440 --> 05:54:59,440
That was already like super successful and popular.

6732
05:54:59,440 --> 05:55:01,440
And then what, like they left in

6733
05:55:01,440 --> 05:55:03,440
an accidental scene.

6734
05:55:03,440 --> 05:55:05,440
And then like, the whole of

6735
05:55:05,440 --> 05:55:07,440
YouTube was like, well, we're not doing that again.

6736
05:55:07,440 --> 05:55:09,440
And they're like, outbending stuff.

6737
05:55:09,440 --> 05:55:11,440
And do they have YouTube as well?

6738
05:55:11,440 --> 05:55:13,440
No, the ice face cover!

6739
05:55:15,440 --> 05:55:17,440
Thank you, you're not even the fart!

6740
05:55:17,440 --> 05:55:19,440
I'll be going hard!

6741
05:55:19,440 --> 05:55:21,440
I need to hurry up and record

6742
05:55:21,440 --> 05:55:23,440
some of my parody songs.

6743
05:55:23,440 --> 05:55:25,440
I keep stalling on all my projects,

6744
05:55:25,440 --> 05:55:27,440
but okay, how about next month?

6745
05:55:27,440 --> 05:55:29,440
I upload all of my ASMR collabs.

6746
05:55:31,440 --> 05:55:33,440
And I recover my ASMR debt.

6747
05:55:33,440 --> 05:55:35,440
Okay, surely, copy them.

6748
05:55:35,440 --> 05:55:37,440
And I also record

6749
05:55:37,440 --> 05:55:39,440
my song covers

6750
05:55:39,440 --> 05:55:41,440
that I want to do.

6751
05:55:41,440 --> 05:55:43,440
Cause I wanted to release a song cover every month.

6752
05:55:43,440 --> 05:55:45,440
Obviously that's not quite worked out.

6753
05:55:45,440 --> 05:55:47,440
But, how about next month

6754
05:55:47,440 --> 05:55:49,440
is our month reflings?

6755
05:55:49,440 --> 05:55:51,440
Okay, next month,

6756
05:55:51,440 --> 05:55:53,440
reflings will rise up.

6757
05:55:53,440 --> 05:55:55,440
I will make the content you desire.

6758
05:55:59,440 --> 05:56:01,440
The Elsa pregnant by Spider-Man Brain Raw ASMR?

6759
05:56:01,440 --> 05:56:03,440
Probably.

6760
05:56:03,440 --> 05:56:05,440
Why did you give Emmy the idea to use a Brain Raw ASMR?

6761
05:56:05,440 --> 05:56:07,440
It was a

6762
05:56:07,440 --> 05:56:09,440
one

6763
05:56:09,440 --> 05:56:11,440
before I started getting accused.

6764
05:56:11,440 --> 05:56:13,440
I

6765
05:56:13,440 --> 05:56:15,440
was specifically requesting

6766
05:56:15,440 --> 05:56:17,440
a 60 second ASMR

6767
05:56:17,440 --> 05:56:19,440
short from her.

6768
05:56:19,440 --> 05:56:21,440
Are you okay?

6769
05:56:21,440 --> 05:56:23,440
Emmy?

6770
05:56:25,440 --> 05:56:27,440
Are you making her gag on it?

6771
05:56:27,440 --> 05:56:29,440
What's going on here?

6772
05:56:29,440 --> 05:56:31,440
Emmy?

6773
05:56:31,440 --> 05:56:33,440
Is she okay?

6774
05:56:35,440 --> 05:56:37,440
Oh,

6775
05:56:37,440 --> 05:56:39,440
poor Emmy.

6776
05:56:39,440 --> 05:56:41,440
Okay, she didn't like the taste.

6777
05:56:41,440 --> 05:56:43,440
Okay, she's okay.

6778
05:56:49,440 --> 05:56:51,440
It was actually me on her marshmallow.

6779
05:56:51,440 --> 05:56:53,440
It was me.

6780
05:56:53,440 --> 05:56:55,440
Real. Real. It was me.

6781
05:56:59,440 --> 05:57:01,440
It was actually me on my side.

6782
05:57:01,440 --> 05:57:03,440
I'm sorry.

6783
05:57:03,440 --> 05:57:05,440
Baseball met.

6784
05:57:07,440 --> 05:57:09,440
A song of recorder.

6785
05:57:09,440 --> 05:57:11,440
Then you'll be able to

6786
05:57:11,440 --> 05:57:13,440
know

6787
05:57:13,440 --> 05:57:15,440
things are finally getting like passed out of my hands.

6788
05:57:15,440 --> 05:57:17,440
It's just getting them out of my hands.

6789
05:57:17,440 --> 05:57:19,440
Like, I say it every week

6790
05:57:19,440 --> 05:57:21,440
and I'm like, I'm almost there

6791
05:57:21,440 --> 05:57:23,440
and then something gets added to my list

6792
05:57:23,440 --> 05:57:25,440
and it just devastates like the behind the scenes.

6793
05:57:25,440 --> 05:57:27,440
My goal after this

6794
05:57:27,440 --> 05:57:29,440
endurance stream is I'm going to go lie down.

6795
05:57:29,440 --> 05:57:31,440
I'll either have a big sleep

6796
05:57:31,440 --> 05:57:33,440
or I'll have a nap.

6797
05:57:33,440 --> 05:57:35,440
And when I wake up, I'm going to edit the side

6798
05:57:35,440 --> 05:57:37,440
collab, okay?

6799
05:57:37,440 --> 05:57:39,440
And I'm going to record

6800
05:57:39,440 --> 05:57:41,440
the fally sounds for the

6801
05:57:41,440 --> 05:57:43,440
Poseidon collab because I need updated sounds.

6802
05:57:43,440 --> 05:57:45,440
I am going to record

6803
05:57:45,440 --> 05:57:47,440
what is called

6804
05:57:47,440 --> 05:57:49,440
wooden soup ASMR.

6805
05:57:49,440 --> 05:57:51,440
I've never recorded it before.

6806
05:57:51,440 --> 05:57:53,440
I bought like these little

6807
05:57:53,440 --> 05:57:55,440
like wooden cubes

6808
05:57:55,440 --> 05:57:57,440
and I'm going to put them in a bowl

6809
05:57:57,440 --> 05:57:59,440
and then I'm going to circle them around for the ASMR.

6810
05:57:59,440 --> 05:58:01,440
It's Esteban back. What is Esteban doing?

6811
05:58:01,440 --> 05:58:03,440
You nutty rat you.

6812
05:58:05,440 --> 05:58:07,440
Get a little spanking

6813
05:58:07,440 --> 05:58:09,440
Esteban.

6814
05:58:09,440 --> 05:58:11,440
Okay, we're almost in the 17,000s.

6815
05:58:11,440 --> 05:58:13,440
Which is good.

6816
05:58:13,440 --> 05:58:15,440
Legal soup.

6817
05:58:15,440 --> 05:58:17,440
Literally like wooden soup.

6818
05:58:17,440 --> 05:58:19,440
Brain rot with so severe her pee-pee dying.

6819
05:58:19,440 --> 05:58:21,440
Literally.

6820
05:58:21,440 --> 05:58:23,440
I went to watch your streams

6821
05:58:23,440 --> 05:58:25,440
more strongly but I started my new semester

6822
05:58:25,440 --> 05:58:27,440
at uni.

6823
05:58:27,440 --> 05:58:29,440
I started streaming

6824
05:58:29,440 --> 05:58:31,440
at 4M.

6825
05:58:31,440 --> 05:58:33,440
Ozy gang, gang, gang, gang, gang.

6826
05:58:33,440 --> 05:58:35,440
No, education first.

6827
05:58:35,440 --> 05:58:37,440
Education first.

6828
05:58:37,440 --> 05:58:39,440
100%.

6829
05:58:39,440 --> 05:58:41,440
Education comes first.

6830
05:58:41,440 --> 05:58:43,440
See?

6831
05:58:43,440 --> 05:58:45,440
So don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

6832
05:58:45,440 --> 05:58:47,440
What kind of car do you drive?

6833
05:58:47,440 --> 05:58:49,440
I don't know how to drive.

6834
05:58:49,440 --> 05:58:51,440
I ride a bike

6835
05:58:51,440 --> 05:58:53,440
and I walk.

6836
05:58:53,440 --> 05:58:55,440
I am

6837
05:58:55,440 --> 05:58:57,440
a bike enthusiast.

6838
05:58:57,440 --> 05:58:59,440
I like my bike.

6839
05:58:59,440 --> 05:59:01,440
Esteban.

6840
05:59:05,440 --> 05:59:07,440
Give me the backup burger.

6841
05:59:09,440 --> 05:59:11,440
She tried.

6842
05:59:11,440 --> 05:59:13,440
Yes, she tried so hard for the burger.

6843
05:59:13,440 --> 05:59:15,440
Esteban.

6844
05:59:15,440 --> 05:59:17,440
Esteban.

6845
05:59:25,440 --> 05:59:27,440
She drives the strongy on a bike.

6846
05:59:27,440 --> 05:59:29,440
Education first with what strongy

6847
05:59:29,440 --> 05:59:31,440
means is there

6848
05:59:31,440 --> 05:59:33,440
when mommy has the next education stream

6849
05:59:33,440 --> 05:59:35,440
real.

6850
05:59:35,440 --> 05:59:37,440
I'm not going to be able to watch like at all

6851
05:59:37,440 --> 05:59:39,440
in September because I'm going back to uni

6852
05:59:39,440 --> 05:59:41,440
and start work again.

6853
05:59:41,440 --> 05:59:43,440
Rip.

6854
05:59:43,440 --> 05:59:45,440
I like to

6855
05:59:45,440 --> 05:59:47,440
definitely see that kind of

6856
05:59:47,440 --> 05:59:49,440
life experience.

6857
05:59:49,440 --> 05:59:51,440
You don't have to be perfect.

6858
05:59:51,440 --> 05:59:53,440
Did she just make the country girls

6859
05:59:53,440 --> 05:59:55,440
make do jokes or did I just mishear that?

6860
05:59:55,440 --> 05:59:57,440
What if walking for 30 minutes?

6861
05:59:57,440 --> 05:59:59,440
Even if walking

6862
05:59:59,440 --> 06:00:01,440
for 30 minutes to me sounds insane.

6863
06:00:01,440 --> 06:00:03,440
What?

6864
06:00:03,440 --> 06:00:05,440
It still boggles the mind that Europeans got all your stuff so close.

6865
06:00:05,440 --> 06:00:07,440
Yeah.

6866
06:00:07,440 --> 06:00:09,440
I follow a tiktok

6867
06:00:09,440 --> 06:00:11,440
that talks about American infrastructure

6868
06:00:11,440 --> 06:00:16,300
and how it would be like they take an issue like for example a junction in a

6869
06:00:16,300 --> 06:00:20,480
road that's far too busy traffic jam central and how they change it and I

6870
06:00:20,480 --> 06:00:25,940
kid you not every solution is put a roundabout at this bit and then the

6871
06:00:25,940 --> 06:00:30,840
traffic flows fine but apparently roundabouts aren't really a thing in

6872
06:00:30,840 --> 06:00:39,640
America's um yeah she did make that joke oh god how did a pedestrian friendly

6873
06:00:39,640 --> 06:00:48,080
infrastructure feels like oh I'm so sorry I'm very lucky they're starting to add

6874
06:00:48,080 --> 06:00:55,640
more oh that's fantastic hopefully soon the solution isn't one more lane and

6875
06:00:55,640 --> 06:01:01,840
it's like okay roundabout here roundabout here Americans fear the roundabout

6876
06:01:01,840 --> 06:01:05,920
they exist somewhere we have roundabouts just not really on main road when a

6877
06:01:05,920 --> 06:01:12,600
roundabout got put in my town it saved us literally like at first I suppose

6878
06:01:12,600 --> 06:01:16,180
getting used to a new kind of junction in a road that you're not familiar with is

6879
06:01:16,180 --> 06:01:26,520
like really intimidating but that's good thank you for coming a member

6880
06:01:26,520 --> 06:01:32,920
enjoy the emotes there's tons of them roundabout or roundabout a bound not

6881
06:01:32,920 --> 06:01:37,480
roundabout the real fun begins when there's a crash that closes down like

6882
06:01:37,480 --> 06:01:44,440
four lanes leaving the city yeah I guess cuz I don't drive I don't understand

6883
06:01:44,440 --> 06:01:50,240
how like traffic exists I know that sounds so silly but like there is road

6884
06:01:50,240 --> 06:01:59,880
go where's the traffic being formed go forward smile move forward the road

6885
06:01:59,880 --> 06:02:05,120
doesn't just disappear and end so how does try like I know it sounds so dumb

6886
06:02:05,120 --> 06:02:12,840
and silly but how does traffic work bascoots thank you for the member tier

6887
06:02:12,840 --> 06:02:17,720
enjoy the member stream that I don't think I called you a basket the first time

6888
06:02:17,720 --> 06:02:21,600
I said that but thank you nonetheless more cars not off-road I fucking hate the

6889
06:02:21,600 --> 06:02:26,160
American system roadway system where I live we don't have the best public

6890
06:02:26,160 --> 06:02:32,080
transport in the world but it's a thousand times better mmm I love my bike

6891
06:02:32,080 --> 06:02:36,080
I'm literally a bike nerd that like keeps me nice and happy and it keeps my

6892
06:02:36,080 --> 06:02:45,680
heart healthy more people more cars I thought that close enough did I like

6893
06:02:45,680 --> 06:02:50,520
say it terribly wrong

6894
06:02:51,520 --> 06:02:58,320
a rat is indestructible in terms of what they can put in their stomach

6895
06:02:59,320 --> 06:03:03,560
traffic is formed by human error slowing stopping anything that involves a

6896
06:03:03,560 --> 06:03:09,360
slight change of flow known as a traffic snake imagine if a group of kitten

6897
06:03:09,360 --> 06:03:13,000
going down a tunnel each kitten basically moves kind of random and they

6898
06:03:13,000 --> 06:03:17,120
bump in each other and they get a strike okay the bike would be good for your

6899
06:03:17,120 --> 06:03:22,400
heart issues wouldn't it yes and to regularly exercise my heart it's why

6900
06:03:22,400 --> 06:03:26,720
I was a bit concerned this morning this is the first time I've had a heart

6901
06:03:26,720 --> 06:03:33,080
flutter in a very long time and which makes me a bit nervous because I don't

6902
06:03:33,080 --> 06:03:37,280
exercise like after streams at all like I've hardly gone outside like I've gone

6903
06:03:37,280 --> 06:03:43,240
outside three times and my dad kind of counted for the other occasions and so

6904
06:03:43,240 --> 06:03:49,040
I'm a little bit nervous at that heart flutter I didn't like it but I'll keep

6905
06:03:49,040 --> 06:03:55,240
you guys updated like I've got blinks tomorrow which is like I think it's

6906
06:03:55,240 --> 06:03:59,680
supposed to be a four-hour stream or something like I'll force myself to go

6907
06:03:59,680 --> 06:04:06,200
on a walk and kind of start looking after myself please exercise about me I

6908
06:04:06,200 --> 06:04:11,880
will I will I'll play how about we do aim to bring fit streams in a month type

6909
06:04:11,880 --> 06:04:15,200
thing I don't want to overdo it but like we'll try and do that like so we get

6910
06:04:15,200 --> 06:04:20,400
that thingy either exercise or we'll boycott stream real so what mommy's

6911
06:04:20,400 --> 06:04:26,360
saying we're ranked but literally oh do you have a murmur I like what the fuck

6912
06:04:26,360 --> 06:04:32,160
are they talking about in the vod I tune out a little bit and I come back to that

6913
06:04:32,160 --> 06:04:35,000
question

6914
06:04:37,760 --> 06:04:43,560
bruh we can do like a 30 minute straight stream cracks a bit but I want to see

6915
06:04:43,560 --> 06:04:49,080
those squats fish women please stretch out a minimum yeah should I do yoga like

6916
06:04:49,080 --> 06:04:57,320
self yoga you're an inside cat pretty much I don't do anything I pheromone

6917
06:04:57,320 --> 06:05:08,840
max I have an amazing time streaming and then I sleep and record and wake up

6918
06:05:08,840 --> 06:05:14,880
and eat and yeah yoga would be a self yoga stream you guys don't be able to

6919
06:05:14,880 --> 06:05:18,840
see me though like if I got a 3d model I would definitely do that kind of stuff

6920
06:05:18,840 --> 06:05:23,480
more because I love that stuff like I would get those like little steps that

6921
06:05:23,480 --> 06:05:27,400
you jump off and we can do like one of those jumping streams motorcycles are

6922
06:05:27,400 --> 06:05:32,040
excellent I need to do more ring fit but the light well I was can I didn't know

6923
06:05:32,040 --> 06:05:35,720
how much this is allowed or not allowed in the v-tuning world you know how

6924
06:05:35,720 --> 06:05:40,880
there's that combat gear that's out and about and it like completely covers up

6925
06:05:40,880 --> 06:05:44,360
your face because you put like black marker like over your eye area and

6926
06:05:44,360 --> 06:05:49,640
everything I thought about doing a full tactical dress in real life stream like

6927
06:05:49,640 --> 06:05:55,960
for exercise but then I was like oh I don't think folk like that in the

6928
06:05:55,960 --> 06:06:00,000
v-tuning world you know but like you wouldn't see my face or anything the

6929
06:06:00,000 --> 06:06:06,400
most you see is like my hands because everything's in tactical gear what is the

6930
06:06:06,400 --> 06:06:12,680
toe stamp I'm with me on this one what is the toe stamp like a fingerprint of

6931
06:06:12,680 --> 06:06:15,120
your toe

6932
06:06:18,120 --> 06:06:24,640
oil Baron what oil burns get this woman a 3d oh right no no no I was like oh

6933
06:06:24,640 --> 06:06:36,200
whoo I mean bow and gearie I don't want to do anything that would affect the

6934
06:06:36,200 --> 06:06:45,360
success of the girls and now this is the one thing is by association if one of

6935
06:06:45,360 --> 06:06:52,640
us fucks up by association we all fuck up and obviously you as the viewers know

6936
06:06:52,640 --> 06:07:00,080
that's not like a real yours it's like that's not a real thing like but public

6937
06:07:00,080 --> 06:07:04,880
perception as I said vealers public perception is slowly shifting but it's

6938
06:07:04,880 --> 06:07:09,920
still not great like we still have like eight like tons of agencies that ignore

6939
06:07:09,920 --> 06:07:13,800
us like we don't really get mentioned anywhere we don't really get invited to

6940
06:07:13,800 --> 06:07:18,560
collapse unless we pursue them and so like for the agencies that do fuck with

6941
06:07:18,560 --> 06:07:24,120
us we fuck with them very hard type thing and but we are against the odds and

6942
06:07:24,120 --> 06:07:30,680
it's a bit like we need to definitely be good you know strongy octopus or squid

6943
06:07:30,840 --> 06:07:40,240
cutfish and sweat mentioned tactical you're belching already filtered the

6944
06:07:40,240 --> 06:07:44,840
anti-real alright real true real hold on let me just muster up a burp right now I

6945
06:07:44,840 --> 06:07:50,320
can't I don't know how the girls work on command don't want to stunt the growth

6946
06:07:50,320 --> 06:07:54,360
guilt by association pretty much yes unfortunately this is a very real thing

6947
06:07:54,360 --> 06:08:03,240
I've discovered and it sucks it does so I don't want to do anything that and is

6948
06:08:03,240 --> 06:08:12,000
too yeah you know what I'm trying to say I just I want I want nothing but the

6949
06:08:12,000 --> 06:08:16,440
girls to succeed and the last thing I want is after all this time and love and

6950
06:08:16,440 --> 06:08:20,960
effort and energy put into my daughters is for me to be the one to fuck

6951
06:08:20,960 --> 06:08:25,640
everything up out of my like raw stupidity you know mostly just in

6952
06:08:25,640 --> 06:08:33,760
heel and ear I can't do it I got a gut like how do you like I don't know how

6953
06:08:33,760 --> 06:08:37,400
you do I don't know how they're burping on command literally that's crazy like I

6954
06:08:37,400 --> 06:08:42,800
can't do it strong about your health do you think you'd enjoy a treadmill and

6955
06:08:42,800 --> 06:08:54,560
I've seen those walking Emmy Emmy stop eating the food 3d model fund no thank

6956
06:08:54,560 --> 06:09:02,080
you John omni thank you for the 3d model fund and we're actually discussing

6957
06:09:02,080 --> 06:09:05,800
that we've got a big old discussion to do about these kind of things you swallow

6958
06:09:05,800 --> 06:09:15,800
air than push out how do you swallow air I'm like I don't know how to do it like

6959
06:09:15,800 --> 06:09:20,320
Emmy and Azura did it so quickly in that last stream they were like yeah yeah

6960
06:09:20,320 --> 06:09:28,560
yeah yeah I guess I've never been able to burp on command make air go down the

6961
06:09:28,560 --> 06:09:36,200
wrong hole well see the wrong hole for me is actually the right hole

6962
06:09:40,120 --> 06:09:50,800
I tried he imagine you're sucking in a straw then so I can't do it what the

6963
06:09:50,800 --> 06:10:00,520
fuck it's not going I tried being a punchline you can't burp either nice

6964
06:10:00,520 --> 06:10:06,880
clothes and swallows and your soul for you get off the stage lovingly

6965
06:10:09,760 --> 06:10:15,560
God asked about who's the star of the show in this stream I think I've seen

6966
06:10:15,560 --> 06:10:20,280
Luna once and have we seen anyone else at all

6967
06:10:24,240 --> 06:10:28,420
if anyone was there we don't be like Esteban's obviously flinching because

6968
06:10:28,420 --> 06:10:33,640
Emmy abuses her like bullshit Esteban would not be gone that close to me are

6969
06:10:33,640 --> 06:10:36,040
you joking

6970
06:10:36,040 --> 06:10:41,680
me saying

6971
06:10:42,560 --> 06:10:46,320
Mr. Van the man it literally I'm where's Dennis the man so I'm gonna see me

6972
06:10:46,320 --> 06:10:50,640
then Luna shine Dennis was afraid of the camera I guess Dennis wasn't used to

6973
06:10:50,640 --> 06:10:57,280
the setup Esteban just doesn't like it yeah maybe you're through and Mercer is

6974
06:10:57,360 --> 06:11:03,780
总's

6975
06:11:06,240 --> 06:11:11,520
yeah fortunately that was part of the

6976
06:11:11,520 --> 06:11:28,520
Rotism. Rotism. Rotism. I work hard so my babies can have an easy life. They are my responsibility

6977
06:11:28,520 --> 06:11:57,520
I will do what I can to make it easy. She says. Have ever come up? No emmy spank. No emmy bad emmy bonk.

6978
06:11:57,520 --> 06:12:26,520
Do you think balers made ASMR roleplay channels considered VTuber? No em so if you think in terms of someone who may be an ASMR roleplayer or vice versa a VTuber that is looking to diversify their content both contents have an overlapping niche voice what can you

6979
06:12:26,520 --> 06:12:46,520
do with your voice you can do ASMR you can do roleplays you can do alternative audios the overlap between both of those communities is so strong that it is very common and it is very accepted as well because both as I said like obviously this I am not really the regular

6980
06:12:46,520 --> 06:13:11,520
VTuber but like my voice is me and well what else can I do with my voice well I can make a roleplay where I am pregnant with you in my tummy because roleplaying is very easily accessible

6981
06:13:11,520 --> 06:13:22,520

06:13:27,520 --> 06:13:47,520
I mean I don't want to go too much in a decent way

6984
06:13:47,520 --> 06:13:58,520
as I said when if and when the girls leave they're more than welcome to say that they're hey I'm back here

6985
06:13:58,520 --> 06:14:10,520
all feels good man oh my god be sure copium my my copium levels are going up strontium copium is going up here in emmy say that because I get still worried the girls are going to be like I don't want to be here for a second year and I'm like okay cry

6986
06:14:10,520 --> 06:14:12,520

6987
06:14:12,520 --> 06:14:20,520
emmy's getting me pregnant no no no no I'm I'm pregnant I'm pregnant with strontium how does this happen

6988
06:14:20,520 --> 06:14:28,520
I had a really funny about that overlap stuff though it went along with bits of VTubers are remarkably heavy due to common tropes that they fill on

6989
06:14:29,520 --> 06:14:39,520
it just doesn't bother me none of it bothers me like I feel like just because we're all adults here it's like

6990
06:14:39,520 --> 06:14:49,520
I'll be your little seahorse strontium no wait because seahorse males like carry carry

6991
06:14:49,520 --> 06:15:00,520
oh emmy mentioned your PL yeah no no I never I said to the girls if you want to mention it you can if you don't need anyone to use anyone to

6992
06:15:00,520 --> 06:15:11,520
we'll be here for the second year thank you I thought I was safe from em pregnant no it was a miss it was a miss input it was a miss input come the fuck down

6993
06:15:11,520 --> 06:15:29,520
I know I've told everyone why I picked them because I see a bit myself in them is that bad of me to say that I picked

6994
06:15:29,520 --> 06:15:44,520
you're right you're right now to go um actually a lot of these smarts can be chipped and get a lot of flak from their ear smart

6995
06:15:44,520 --> 06:15:53,520
only viewers real that happened to my friend but you got loads of fucking flak for it oh my god this happens all the time and it's like

6996
06:15:54,520 --> 06:16:04,520
bro do you honestly expect someone to sit and do the same same thing for 10 fucking years oh oh you're railing me up

6997
06:16:04,520 --> 06:16:14,520
look at the look at my mouse quivering and rage oh do you really expect your content creator to never diversify and do the exact same thing for 10 years

6998
06:16:14,520 --> 06:16:24,520
oh I'm quivering I'm quivering look at that mouse look at that mouse I'm quivering I'm quivering I'm quivering I'm reading

6999
06:16:24,520 --> 06:16:34,520
it's the whole live meme adjusted for beer alarm yag is home for broken girl oh I didn't realise that sorry you find shadow people ok I'll calm down

7000
06:16:35,520 --> 06:16:43,520
I've calmed down I've calmed down I'm ok I'm ok I'm ok a smart only viewers can be finicky literally

7001
06:16:43,520 --> 06:16:50,520
Angie you don't want to see her when she's Angie that friend that was supposed to originally guess she'd be snuck up yeah she got flak for it

7002
06:16:51,520 --> 06:17:00,520
and I was like I remember reading some of the feedback and I was like at that point had literally been at it for like 4 years

7003
06:17:00,520 --> 06:17:07,520
and it was like literally so much free content over like hours upon hours upon hours of free content

7004
06:17:07,520 --> 06:17:13,520
and you're complaining that she wants to do something different like it happened with baby pink as well

7005
06:17:13,520 --> 06:17:28,520
and I'm like I think Dream of Peach has caught some of it as well and I'm like do you seriously want your content creator to be pigeonholed into this one fucking thing

7006
06:17:28,520 --> 06:17:35,520
never diversify their content never be able to achieve their goals of like being a homeowner type thing or like diversifying their income source

7007
06:17:35,520 --> 06:17:45,520
because we've seen how quick Patreon can like snap it away how quick YouTube can snap it away like fuck me for doing a bit of a finger in all the pies type method

7008
06:17:45,520 --> 06:17:51,520
like oh my god please be nicer your content creators their income is not reassured like at all

7009
06:17:54,520 --> 06:18:00,520
a smart only viewers can be very needy the ones aren't shadows just not worth the energy it's the same issue with bands as well

7010
06:18:00,520 --> 06:18:02,520
people get so upset when they change their sound

7011
06:18:02,520 --> 06:18:07,520
literally you want like do you want the exact same sound every single time

7012
06:18:07,520 --> 06:18:08,520
no

7013
06:18:09,520 --> 06:18:11,520
oh what is that in me

7014
06:18:11,520 --> 06:18:13,520
is that a burger

7015
06:18:15,520 --> 06:18:17,520
it looks anemic

7016
06:18:17,520 --> 06:18:19,520
why is it anemic

7017
06:18:24,520 --> 06:18:25,520
why is

7018
06:18:25,520 --> 06:18:27,520
even the chip looks anemic

7019
06:18:31,520 --> 06:18:34,520
and now I'll pass

7020
06:18:34,520 --> 06:18:36,520
thanks little sis though

7021
06:18:38,520 --> 06:18:40,520
oh my god

7022
06:18:40,520 --> 06:18:43,520
how dare you pursue your dreams

7023
06:18:43,520 --> 06:18:50,520
literally how dare you don't ever be interested in something remotely similar to your like creative outlet

7024
06:18:50,520 --> 06:18:52,520
like I'm gonna actually just

7025
06:18:52,520 --> 06:18:56,520
I'm gonna just take my five inches already like what

7026
06:19:00,520 --> 06:19:07,520
it's made of wax and corsair she worked hard on a woman some peeps really don't understand the idea of having multiple passions

7027
06:19:09,520 --> 06:19:14,520
and I know a person that was a smart only but the community ruined it and now she's beat your bro and I

7028
06:19:14,520 --> 06:19:22,520
bruh fucking tell him like preach like all the fucking power to like getting it ruined by our sats

7029
06:19:22,520 --> 06:19:25,520
how dare you try not to grow men

7030
06:19:26,520 --> 06:19:28,520
he he

7031
06:19:28,520 --> 06:19:33,520
contains a legal amount of rat hair that's so good

7032
06:19:33,520 --> 06:19:35,520
that is so good

7033
06:19:37,520 --> 06:19:40,520
imagine getting five inches from me though

7034
06:19:46,520 --> 06:19:48,520
cut your losses

7035
06:19:48,520 --> 06:19:51,520
yeah from going by the VOD time I think she went more

7036
06:19:51,520 --> 06:19:55,520
I don't know considering the VOD goes on for another 58 minutes

7037
06:19:55,520 --> 06:19:57,520
I think she might have won

7038
06:20:00,520 --> 06:20:02,520
a bit of a bad idea

7039
06:20:03,520 --> 06:20:08,520
would you play it on a virtual headset I have never touched 3d

7040
06:20:08,520 --> 06:20:17,520
I am begging and pleading that the girls have 3d experience because I have zero if not I'm going on my hands and knees and contacting sin

7041
06:20:17,520 --> 06:20:22,520
to be like hey bestie you know how you did that 3d thing

7042
06:20:22,520 --> 06:20:30,520
can you just tell me everything and explain it like I'm a toddler so I know what to do for the girls so that'd be great

7043
06:20:30,520 --> 06:20:36,520
and sin will be literally in a voice call with me and see you you fucking bitch waking me up at this time cause we're in two different times

7044
06:20:36,520 --> 06:20:42,520
I was in a call with her last night I think

7045
06:20:42,520 --> 06:20:46,520
no I wasn't I was in a text with her last night

7046
06:20:46,520 --> 06:20:50,520
I was in a voice call with her like a couple of days ago

7047
06:20:50,520 --> 06:20:54,520
having a kitty on the both of us having a kitty on

7048
06:20:58,520 --> 06:21:02,520
I would I either know that same person or another career went through something

7049
06:21:02,520 --> 06:21:06,520
give strong credit she has at least six inches I mean it's probably four

7050
06:21:06,520 --> 06:21:09,520
I'm just saying five to really

7051
06:21:09,520 --> 06:21:13,520
you know what else is 12 inches three of these

7052
06:21:13,520 --> 06:21:16,520
3d is pretty cool but 2d works this thing

7053
06:21:16,520 --> 06:21:22,520
oh don't get me wrong I'm in no rush to like pop out 3d do you know how expensive like these models were

7054
06:21:22,520 --> 06:21:24,520
bruh there's no expense I had

7055
06:21:24,520 --> 06:21:33,520
Nari cooked and I adore it but things are very expensive when it comes to like the start up cost of getting to this stage

7056
06:21:33,520 --> 06:21:41,520
and it's kind of like we need to return on investment before we like start planning anything like super major that requires like investment money

7057
06:21:41,520 --> 06:21:46,520
like when I'm saying like all six of us is lollipop sleep ASMR

7058
06:21:46,520 --> 06:21:52,520
although that is technically an investment whoever's channel it goes on I'll probably put on the least subscribed channel

7059
06:21:52,520 --> 06:21:57,520
will like benefit from that and subs and views and money type thing and like obviously

7060
06:21:57,520 --> 06:22:03,520
I get what I get the company dealer gets 20%

7061
06:22:03,520 --> 06:22:14,520
and then it goes to the return on investment which then goes to like 3d all outfits plans are behind the scenes that are developing

7062
06:22:14,520 --> 06:22:20,520
and what maybe maybe gen 2 production

7063
06:22:21,520 --> 06:22:24,520
yeah I don't know

7064
06:22:24,520 --> 06:22:32,520
return on investment inspiring investors come knock no they can literally lick my chocolate starfish

7065
06:22:32,520 --> 06:22:40,520
do not even have the audacity to message the website to put your grubby little paws on my daughters it's not happening

7066
06:22:40,520 --> 06:22:42,520
you can kiss it goodbye

7067
06:22:42,520 --> 06:22:47,520
the only investors I'll allow is a cheeky $3 donation

7068
06:22:47,520 --> 06:22:51,520
that's the only investment I'll allow being like this is going towards the

7069
06:22:51,520 --> 06:22:55,520
I mean jeez it's I mean oh my god I mean you're so French what the fuck

7070
06:22:55,520 --> 06:23:00,520
I know you're French Canadian but really more you're so French Canadian

7071
06:23:00,520 --> 06:23:03,520
I'm an investor

7072
06:23:03,520 --> 06:23:09,520
no way peach emoji chocolate and lick combo that is outrageous

7073
06:23:10,520 --> 06:23:18,520
gen 2 mentioned like productions unconfirmed ok that's all you need at this stage it's like not in production

7074
06:23:18,520 --> 06:23:20,520
like it's not confirmed it's unconfirmed

7075
06:23:20,520 --> 06:23:23,520
no investors don't get the privilege of the starfish

7076
06:23:24,520 --> 06:23:28,520
blessed combo the fans are the true investors

7077
06:23:28,520 --> 06:23:35,520
honestly if you want to describe it that way I will genuinely 100% agree

7078
06:23:35,520 --> 06:23:44,520
you can fucking put my number down when you apply or if you need a reference on your CV for a job application

7079

7080
06:23:51,520 --> 06:23:59,520

7081
06:23:59,520 --> 06:24:07,520
but in on an individual scale with their investing opportunity and they led five girls into success

7082
06:24:07,520 --> 06:24:13,520
to achieve their goals and their dreams and their aspirations and not only that it had a knock-on effect

7083
06:24:13,520 --> 06:24:19,520
to then later help another 12 girls in theory ok so there if you ever need someone to vouch for your job application

tiny a lot of feet and hands honestly. How small is she? She must be like five foot tall or something.

7113
06:26:30,480 --> 06:26:36,960
Did she say how tall she is? I can't remember. I feel like I'm taller than her.

7114
06:26:39,040 --> 06:26:43,520
So do you Bila. No but like Emmy's like proper tiny.

7115
06:26:43,600 --> 06:26:47,040
Oh sorry. Sorry Edgeville Bank. Just thought I'd edge you a bit more.

7116
06:26:49,120 --> 06:26:54,880
You are a cuttlefish of sheer determining nation. 10% determination. Actually 100%

7117
06:26:54,880 --> 06:27:02,240
determination. 100% power will. 100% zero concentration because I'm on TikTok brain rotting.

7118
06:27:02,240 --> 06:27:14,880
Oh my god her veto is so cute. I miss having a toenail. Oh my god wait I can start making

7128
06:28:34,080 --> 06:28:41,200
literally. Oh my god everyone loves runescape. Everyone's loving runescape. Makeup month literally.

7129
06:28:41,760 --> 06:28:50,880
Let it be known that August is makeup month. Tonight I'm recording my ASMR. My last one.

7130
06:28:52,480 --> 06:28:57,920
Oh no they've been mensable. Who made me upset? I'm gonna fart on them.

7131
06:28:59,840 --> 06:29:02,080
I'm gonna fart on them. Who made my daughter upset?

7132
06:29:04,880 --> 06:29:06,880
Who made my daughter upset?

7133
06:29:09,440 --> 06:29:13,360
Weflin's gonna get that cake. Congrats on the incredible and visionary

7134
06:29:13,360 --> 06:29:16,960
content no other creator dared to do. You really understand the minds of mankind.

7135
06:29:16,960 --> 06:29:22,560
Must be the caught fish bov. Ah yes when I dropped my pregnancy ASMR I'm sure everyone

7136
06:29:22,560 --> 06:29:25,040
will be like this is exactly the ASMR I wanted.

7137
06:29:25,760 --> 06:29:29,760
Where'd it go?

7138
06:29:34,400 --> 06:29:39,280
Ah Amy's a cutie pie I think that's it. The rat soup was so funny. Tonight you're

7139
06:29:39,280 --> 06:29:43,520
going for a short walk and drinking lots of water and fuck. Right okay water hydration check.

7140
06:29:43,520 --> 06:29:50,800
I used to be so good at it last year and I'm fucking doing nothing. Okay hydration.

7141
06:29:55,440 --> 06:29:57,520
5k for what?

7142
06:30:00,240 --> 06:30:09,120
For what? Showing her her panini? Why is she showing for 5k? I missed it. What was context?

7143
06:30:12,720 --> 06:30:18,480
What subscribe? Oh subscribers. Subscribers.

7144
06:30:19,120 --> 06:30:27,360
Not her already in the minds of the pinpals before this ends. Who is showing badge? I

7145
06:30:27,360 --> 06:30:34,400
thought Amy was but she we're watching an older vod of Amy and she's like for 10k

7146
06:30:34,400 --> 06:30:38,880
I'll do something and I'm like wait for 10k but obviously this was back at the start where she

7147
06:30:38,880 --> 06:30:45,040
wasn't at 10k subs. This is before she went on holiday. We're watching her play with the rats.

7148
06:30:48,720 --> 06:30:54,800
Mm-mm. Azura. Peeler allegations rest with Azura and her doughnathon. I'm gonna put it in her

7149
06:30:54,800 --> 06:30:59,520
doughnathon and then she's gonna get it reviewed on stream by the Bleaton Hearts and if they like

7150
06:30:59,520 --> 06:31:07,120
it I'm not gonna touch the doughnathon. I love the arc where no matter what strongy does the numbers

7151
06:31:07,120 --> 06:31:12,640
go up in a full stream strongy has a cam on a mint plant she waters occasionally 2 million views

7152
06:31:12,640 --> 06:31:28,000
and counting she's so confused literally. Abram mercy. Oh we popped! 96. 96. 96. 96.

7153
06:31:28,800 --> 06:31:33,040
You leave me in my fanny flaps alone using my wings to fly through strongy's window listen

7154
06:31:33,040 --> 06:31:40,160
to my propeller. Sin. What even? Sin structure is that that you're forcing upon us to read. I was

7155
06:31:40,160 --> 06:31:45,200
literally just talking about you. I was like oh I was in a voice chat with Sin. I need to ask you

7156
06:31:45,200 --> 06:31:50,400
about your 3D setup. I think you're literally the only point of contact I have that knows about 3D.

7157
06:31:51,360 --> 06:31:56,640
I don't think anyone any of the girls at Veil or know about 3D. You're literally my fence.

7158
06:31:59,040 --> 06:32:02,800
You're my fence sheebie. It's sheebie. Sin.

7159
06:32:10,560 --> 06:32:23,280
She went and did it. I was gonna say she went and did it anyway.

7160
06:32:26,160 --> 06:32:34,720
Oh my god she called me my PL. Stop! Stop! Oh my god what is Sin supposed to be? Oh my god what?

7161
06:32:34,720 --> 06:32:40,080
Napo hire? Back in my day 3D models used to be the go-to now it's the opposite.

7162
06:32:41,040 --> 06:32:46,000
You should know that Sin speak of the devil and he shall hear. Say her a long truth.

7163
06:32:47,280 --> 06:32:54,320
Fuck it! No don't laugh at me Sin! What the fuck? You'll napo hire you? I'll napo all over you.

7164
06:32:55,360 --> 06:33:03,840
Kim's on you? I'll napo on you so hard. Don't think I'll ruin the reputation of Veiler for

7165
06:33:03,840 --> 06:33:08,160
being a fair agency. Just the napo hire you. Don't think I won't do it. I'll do it. I'll

7166
06:33:08,160 --> 06:33:13,840
absolutely ruin everything. Run it into the ground. As long as you tell me how 3D works

7167
06:33:13,840 --> 06:33:16,960
and what your fucking trackers are and how you set it up because I've not got a fucking clue.

7168
06:33:16,960 --> 06:33:22,000
Like I need an actual iPhone video from you sent to me in Discord DMs because I don't know what

7169
06:33:22,000 --> 06:33:26,880
on earth I need to do for the girls. I'll ink on your nan. I shite, I shite, I shite.

7170
06:33:27,760 --> 06:33:29,760
I'll ink on your nan.

7171
06:33:36,560 --> 06:33:43,920
What's a nipple hire? No! A napo, nepotism means like oh you get hired purely on the

7172
06:33:43,920 --> 06:33:50,240
basis that you ken them like you know about them and that. I'm not actually sure how that

7173
06:33:50,240 --> 06:33:55,840
ruined the rep. I think that's called contacts. In the business? I don't know just like because

7174
06:33:55,840 --> 06:33:59,200
we kind of got praised publicly for like rooting for the underdog and that and then it's just

7175
06:33:59,200 --> 06:34:06,480
like oh napo hire on the agency. Nepo hire, nepotism. Your nan has nae arms, nae legs and lives in a

7176
06:34:07,040 --> 06:34:13,920
pillowcase! Everyone who's listening to this in the background like what are they

7177
06:34:13,920 --> 06:34:20,800
even on the, what are they bantering with each other then? Also are you smarter than a fifth

7178
06:34:20,880 --> 06:34:31,200
grader is like on epic instead of on flipping some fish? Wait am I being an idiot? Did I not

7179
06:34:31,200 --> 06:34:39,440
have a collab with AC? Am I being papaga? I think I had a collab with AC. I think I got cancelled.

7180
06:34:41,600 --> 06:34:42,560
Am I being dumb?

7181
06:34:46,400 --> 06:34:49,920
I think I got cancelled. Actually that just occurred to me. I had a collab with AC at some

7182
06:34:49,920 --> 06:34:57,120
point. Is it cancelled or is it two weeks away? I mean Nepo hire is more if you've got no other

7183
06:34:57,760 --> 06:35:05,120
redeeming value if they're good at what they do. My brain solution. Isn't AC taking a break? Yeah.

7184
06:35:05,120 --> 06:35:11,120
I think we were supposed to, no we couldn't have because I wasn't in the box. I don't know.

7185
06:35:11,120 --> 06:35:20,800
I don't know. She's collabing with Emmy this week. How do you know? How do you know that?

7186
06:35:20,800 --> 06:35:28,160
What? Who? I stream once a year, Get Me In Lands, Honest. Oh my god portfolio. I'll look, I'm willing

7187
06:35:28,160 --> 06:35:35,200
to look over that portfolio if you send me a picture of how you do your 3D streams. Thank you.

7188
06:35:36,160 --> 06:35:42,160
That's all I need. Emmy released a schedule. Okay that's fine then. You're allowed to know them.

7189
06:35:42,160 --> 06:35:47,680
Yeah. AC and Emmy are collabing. They're gonna play a game called Don't Starve Together and

7190
06:35:47,680 --> 06:35:53,360
apparently Willow is the most OP character and all the characters in the game are named after W

7191
06:35:53,360 --> 06:36:02,080
like Wilson, Willow, something else. I can't believe it. The portfolio is just the 3D stream

7192
06:36:02,080 --> 06:36:09,040
instructions. Literally. No that would be the introduction video. Hi I'm Sin. This is how

7193
06:36:09,040 --> 06:36:16,800
I set up my 3D stream. Thank you. I'll take that thing. Say it again. Sin sister will be a slime girl

7194
06:36:16,800 --> 06:36:26,560
never hire. Really? You think she'd be a fucking slime girl? Slime girl. Someone actually, I looked

7195
06:36:26,560 --> 06:36:38,640
at the 2D, 2D. I looked at the gen to draw in your suggestion stream and someone was like

7196
06:36:38,640 --> 06:36:43,520
why do you hate slime girls and I just thought, I just like the gimmick was old and he replied like,

7197
06:36:44,080 --> 06:36:48,160
I didn't reply to his response but he said something along the lines of like but there's

7198
06:36:48,160 --> 06:36:53,360
so much diversity and I want it to be like but I have to commission the diversity if you want them

7199
06:36:53,360 --> 06:36:59,600
fat skinny long does this big boobs no boobs this this toggle that toggle the concept of a slime is

7200
06:36:59,600 --> 06:37:04,880
good but to translate into a vtuber model is an absolute nightmare because everyone would be like

7201
06:37:04,880 --> 06:37:08,800
well it's the slime girl why can't the slime girl do this this this this this this this this

7202
06:37:08,800 --> 06:37:16,160
because that's how it's like now it's like no no no I don't like that. Hi thanks for joining.

7203
06:37:17,120 --> 06:37:19,760
Win is for a wombo. Don't starve is great wimmy.

7204
06:37:22,560 --> 06:37:27,440
I literally got to pay for a million things. Yeah it's just not possible to translate like it's

7205
06:37:27,440 --> 06:37:34,240
just not happening. Sorry like I'm so sorry if like you guys think I'm like oh Australia's clearly

7206
06:37:34,240 --> 06:37:39,120
like bluffing on this one thing I am not bluffing I can't I can't give a design to someone that I

7207
06:37:39,120 --> 06:37:46,080
think would be a debuff truly. Change it to slime girl. That's true I would pick it would

7208
06:37:46,080 --> 06:37:54,000
perish her wallet literally I've had enough perish in the wallets for one day. Put too much

7209
06:37:54,000 --> 06:37:58,640
love and care I can't believe that put too much love and care into the girls and I grow boss too hard.

7210
06:38:02,000 --> 06:38:08,320
She doesn't hate slime but she loves them. Yes I don't mind the design but in terms of vtuber slime

7211
06:38:09,040 --> 06:38:13,680
everyone is going to be like uh why not?

7212
06:38:19,440 --> 06:38:24,480
Wow she said it not me we were all thinking about it. As long as I like I'm going to get the

7213
06:38:24,480 --> 06:38:31,440
issues she can do anything toggle whip slimy girl strongy when she's ovulating honestly.

7214
06:38:32,160 --> 06:38:35,440
I don't know why not ovulation I think ovulation's about

7215
06:38:40,240 --> 06:38:43,840
less than 14 days away it's still a little while away yet for me.

7216
06:38:47,840 --> 06:38:56,480
She only wants to get a bang to buy a slime but not put one in the gen which is fair right

7217
06:38:56,560 --> 06:39:02,240
there don't read that down. Oh my god you're getting a message right now M.A. you're so

7218
06:39:02,240 --> 06:39:06,800
fired I can't believe it. AC says that all the time she's like oh my god strongy's gonna fire me

7219
06:39:06,800 --> 06:39:14,720
and I'm like what no that's not how it works. Wait did she fart?

7220
06:39:15,440 --> 06:39:26,000
First girl's after this. You heard the reflans you have two weeks no not yet

7221
06:39:27,120 --> 06:39:35,360
and oh actually my birthday October 10th might actually perfectly align with ovulation

7222
06:39:35,360 --> 06:39:40,160
could you imagine? So that's like the 12th I don't know I'll tell you when I'll tell you when

7223
06:39:40,160 --> 06:39:45,600
it happens okay. I don't know if I said it in the education stream but you get like a bit of

7224
06:39:45,600 --> 06:39:50,240
slime that comes out of you that you can straight up identify as like oh that's ovulation slime

7225
06:39:50,240 --> 06:40:00,000
it's bizarre honestly being a woman's bizarre. I just rejoined two weeks for what? Ovulation.

7226
06:40:00,800 --> 06:40:13,920
I saw a lot stringier. I'm a hands-on learner I know I think that Emmy's reinforcing the taboo that

7227
06:40:13,920 --> 06:40:29,520
makes her happy. Oh that's like a good ASMR sound whatever that is. That was honestly

7228
06:40:29,520 --> 06:40:33,840
satisfying hold on a minute M.A. can you send me that for ASMR that'd be great. I turned it like

7229
06:40:34,240 --> 06:40:38,240
drrr drrr drrr. Bansley stream ovulation time.

7230
06:40:41,360 --> 06:40:46,800
Just trying to speedrun. Everyone expected like an endurance stream or whatever and

7231
06:40:47,760 --> 06:40:52,640
literally it's going to be like right let's me down in like less than 10 minutes unless I get too shy.

7232
06:40:53,360 --> 06:41:06,080
We're still going we're endurance and we're level 96 only ton only 16,000 more wines to go.

7233
06:41:11,280 --> 06:41:18,080
Nice background. The 10 minute birthday stream literally k thanks bye. Let us know when I will

7234
06:41:18,080 --> 06:41:23,440
send you something over. Why is it all churned real? Finish in 10 minutes chat for three hours.

7235
06:41:23,440 --> 06:41:25,680
Yeah I mean that could be some level of aftercare.

7236
06:41:32,080 --> 06:41:33,920
Getting my little sister drunk is my win.

7237
06:41:35,760 --> 06:41:42,000
Gonna be the hottest three minutes and 27 seconds. No because that's what's gonna fucking happen.

7238
06:41:48,400 --> 06:41:52,560
That's literally what's gonna happen. I'm not even sure how much I'm allowed to laugh.

7239
06:42:01,680 --> 06:42:09,200
Oh word speedrun. I still would watch. M.A. is actually getting drunk in this and around

7240
06:42:09,200 --> 06:42:15,760
her member stream right now. Is she? Better behave then. I bet that was gonna be gone by the time.

7241
06:42:18,080 --> 06:42:24,320
No not at all. Not at all. Pop that cheese down where you please darling.

7242
06:42:31,440 --> 06:42:41,200
Are we racing? Oh now this is pod racing. Everyone's laughing until the girl pulls out the megatron

7243
06:42:41,520 --> 06:42:47,840
9000. Fucking you know. There are plenty of v-subers that just that's in most streams so I

7244
06:42:47,840 --> 06:42:54,560
won't go for like 30 minutes and chat for two hours at all. Just a matter of got content.

7245
06:42:54,560 --> 06:43:00,880
Imagine being late to the stream. I don't know I'm gonna have to watch what Mercy and all that

7246
06:43:00,880 --> 06:43:06,560
does. They're all like gonna do it first and I need to watch what they do without being a weirdo

7247
06:43:06,560 --> 06:43:13,760
just in terms of like what did you do? Does the mod stay up as content? I don't know how any of it

7248
06:43:13,760 --> 06:43:31,120
works. I don't know how streaming works on it. Her little cute toys. Oh my god that's so cute.

7249
06:43:32,080 --> 06:43:36,880
She loves the cheese.

7250
06:43:51,600 --> 06:43:55,200
I can never explain why but whenever my past girlfriends would have their time of

7251
06:43:55,600 --> 06:44:02,960
hmm I would get very like sometimes it'd be really and have no idea why until the girl pulls out.

7252
06:44:06,880 --> 06:44:09,280
You mean ketchup season or slime season?

7253
06:44:15,920 --> 06:44:21,520
Hey Strani I'm coming from Mimi's members stream and she's doing a great career stream.

7254
06:44:22,000 --> 06:44:26,320
We are all trying to convince her that you should have her do more cover songs

7255
06:44:26,320 --> 06:44:36,560
since she's singing so good. I'm so glad so I picked one song out she picked another song out.

7256
06:44:36,560 --> 06:44:41,680
I basically made our deal I said look here's these channels they've all done well doing this

7257
06:44:41,680 --> 06:44:46,640
can I ask you to do two song covers and if they do pitch I'll never ask you to do anything else

7258
06:44:46,640 --> 06:44:51,120
again and she agreed to it so I do have two songs one's being mixed one's already mixed I'm

7259
06:44:51,120 --> 06:44:59,680
waiting on the animation and then the music video can be produced um but I do not I'm not stopping

7260
06:44:59,680 --> 06:45:02,560
the girls if they want to do song covers or anything of that accord.

7261
06:45:07,280 --> 06:45:13,680
Unsightly like that lute earlick and stuff yeah no I mean you're streamed done in two minutes

7262
06:45:13,680 --> 06:45:21,520
and you're already in the aftercare yeah honestly though I get I fart before right sorry this is

7263
06:45:21,520 --> 06:45:28,480
like a completely unrelated note I get really nervous before I touch the peril for some reason

7264
06:45:28,480 --> 06:45:35,760
and I like to a lot before I do anything I get really nervous to like myself you know I don't

7265
06:45:35,760 --> 06:45:39,840
know why I think like something got crossed in my brain wrong or something

7266
06:45:44,640 --> 06:45:48,320
let's just know like a little fucking start tooting and shit like what the fuck

7267
06:45:49,600 --> 06:45:58,640
that's not hot going like a scrawny cull bun look at buns of steel my last partner was a quick

7268
06:45:59,600 --> 06:46:06,400
she was fun to isn't that post um um um torture

7269
06:46:09,520 --> 06:46:12,800
oh estaban launched herself

7270
06:46:13,040 --> 06:46:28,560
wait so this slimy speak up is different from ketchup so

7271
06:46:32,000 --> 06:46:40,640
how do I say this around the filters so the clam is a self cleaning um organ so it needs to expel

7272
06:46:40,640 --> 06:46:44,960
stuff at all times old cells old mucus all this kind of thing so it's natural to have this thing

7273
06:46:44,960 --> 06:46:51,920
called discharge okay now obviously when it's ketchup season this is in reference to a period so

7274
06:46:51,920 --> 06:47:00,960
that's just um the lining shredding and it's very natural for stuff to come out after the red river

7275
06:47:00,960 --> 06:47:08,800
has finished flowing a couple of days later ovulation will occur now the reason you can identify

7276
06:47:08,800 --> 06:47:17,040
this time frame is because a certain consistency of slime can come out and it's very identifiable

7277
06:47:17,040 --> 06:47:24,480
when you know what you're looking for and so pretty much a woman can be like ashes of fertile

7278
06:47:24,480 --> 06:47:31,440
because women cannot be impregnated during every single day of the month that's not possible that's

7279
06:47:31,440 --> 06:47:40,560
not how the cycle works if for a 48 hour period a woman can become pregnant every month because

7280
06:47:40,560 --> 06:47:45,760
of this monthly cycle that's how it works in humans in particular it's quite different from a ton of

7281
06:47:45,760 --> 06:47:54,000
different mammals um but yeah the um something going to be posted soon on patreon yes either

7282
06:47:55,360 --> 06:48:01,280
most likely tomorrow will be my last audio it'll have multiple endings i'm going to be exhausted

7283
06:48:01,280 --> 06:48:08,800
but i'm gonna get it done so most likely after the blinks stream tomorrow the last patreon audio

7284
06:48:08,800 --> 06:48:16,880
for me goes up and azura as well goes up and it blows it's nose so here i know it exists but

7285
06:48:16,880 --> 06:48:19,520
my part in it need that slime

7286
06:48:23,280 --> 06:48:26,480
this is bizarre when talking about it doggies i'm going to hate me

7287
06:48:26,800 --> 06:48:33,920
so i'm gonna i'm holding my back from saying disgustingly down bad thing it's really rather

7288
06:48:39,760 --> 06:48:44,000
why be the last oh sorry the last of this month every month i'll upload four

7289
06:48:44,720 --> 06:48:51,680
alternative audios but i also mix in my early access stuff because i have the resources to

7290
06:48:51,680 --> 06:48:59,280
do it that way for the girls it's not really that easy to do it unless i gave them like

7291
06:48:59,280 --> 06:49:04,480
direct access to the patreon but i don't want any of the girls to receive any harassment because

7292
06:49:04,480 --> 06:49:11,120
patreon doesn't let you shut down dms they are open and readable and i don't want any of the girls

7293
06:49:11,120 --> 06:49:18,400
to get harassed so i can't let them in if that makes sense so the girls can view how much they air

7294
06:49:18,400 --> 06:49:27,040
and they can see the statistics so and all that no issues but yeah but we love your face and me

7295
06:49:27,040 --> 06:49:38,960
you're so cute it's not the last audio some of the towns call it gossip don't question has

7296
06:49:38,960 --> 06:49:45,840
been set all over we're taking on as if she's spit what i'm sorry i can't follow your story

7297
06:49:45,840 --> 06:49:51,520
i apologize i apologize i should be a little fella i should be that is like conquer's bad for

7298
06:49:51,520 --> 06:49:57,440
day our audios from previous months available yep you have previous access to absolutely

7299
06:49:57,440 --> 06:50:06,560
everything and i do not believe in removing monthly rewards i do not like that system i think it is

7300
06:50:07,360 --> 06:50:13,920
quite now i do understand why other creators do it don't get me wrong but for me i don't like

7301
06:50:13,920 --> 06:50:21,600
the system the girls are adhering to the system that i want to implement so everything is accessible

7302
06:50:23,360 --> 06:50:30,560
um yeah it's okay new dog new dog was a stray around town for a while no one knew who belonged

7303
06:50:30,720 --> 06:50:38,800
to it fam was talking about if it needed dressed or not okay okay okay

7304
06:50:40,960 --> 06:50:42,400
what's going on over there at me

7305
06:50:46,800 --> 06:50:51,520
mostly everything's available from credit all you got to do is just say yes we do not remove like

7306
06:50:51,520 --> 06:50:58,080
so it's july um all the dune contents there all the july contents there and all the content

7307
06:50:58,080 --> 06:51:03,680
is gonna remain nothing's gonna be removed unless one of the girls for some reason had a very

7308
06:51:05,280 --> 06:51:13,840
valid reason for wanting something removed at the point of upload it's there's no plan for removal

7309
06:51:13,840 --> 06:51:21,200
unless at the end of the contract the girls no longer wanted that content up for whatever reason

7310
06:51:21,200 --> 06:51:29,040
because if they left um it's kind of their choice of hey we can continue to give you a payout from

7311
06:51:29,040 --> 06:51:36,640
this source for people who want access to the content for the first time um or if you want to

7312
06:51:36,640 --> 06:51:44,320
take all that content away with you that's your choice um there's a few ways to figure out it's a

7313
06:51:44,320 --> 06:51:52,480
bit of a obviously a last thing i want to do is be predatory towards the girls

7314
06:51:54,720 --> 06:51:57,600
is that where her notification comes from

7315
06:52:01,440 --> 06:52:06,560
i had no clue why her notification was that noise that sent in

7316
06:52:06,560 --> 06:52:15,120
um i didn't know that's where it came from i thought pinpals requested it or something

7317
06:52:16,640 --> 06:52:18,560
no she was just redoing it all right

7318
06:52:27,360 --> 06:52:33,280
not her praise in the corruption arc no emi said it very i think it's just

7319
06:52:33,280 --> 06:52:34,880
oh it's in the andy and lily's okay

7320
06:52:38,480 --> 06:52:39,200
i need to talk

7321
06:52:41,920 --> 06:52:45,520
why is it as soon as i mute to two it goes away

7322
06:52:54,480 --> 06:52:57,520
emi is the biggest corruptor and veiler real

7323
06:53:04,080 --> 06:53:11,040
oh my god i swear if i know who she's talking about uh i have got i have fell for a creator

7324
06:53:11,680 --> 06:53:14,400
who did something like that which is the story

7325
06:53:22,800 --> 06:53:24,480
emi's gonna stab you for saying that

7326
06:53:24,480 --> 06:53:33,120
oh my gosh

7327
06:53:36,160 --> 06:53:37,440
that's actually a really good clip

7328
06:53:40,160 --> 06:53:45,760
brah if any any reflin is open on the board please clip that so i can join it that's a really good

7329
06:53:45,760 --> 06:53:54,080
clip people are lying online never oh i fell for it with another creator and this creator was like

7330
06:53:54,480 --> 06:54:01,440
crying online being like i'm gonna get kicked out and and she had an established ASMR channel

7331
06:54:01,440 --> 06:54:10,800
she just never uploaded um and i fell for her crocodile tears and the egg is on my face um she

7332
06:54:10,800 --> 06:54:14,800
was like i'm gonna get kicked out my landlord this my landlord that so i don't believe in an exchange

7333
06:54:14,800 --> 06:54:19,760
of money so i never gave her any money but she opened up like an emergency fund and like put on

7334
06:54:19,760 --> 06:54:24,480
a community post and all that and overnight she made like two thousand us dollars which covered

7335
06:54:24,480 --> 06:54:31,280
whatever fee she needed to pay to stay in her rental now this was in december okay so just

7336
06:54:31,280 --> 06:54:37,040
keep that in mind it's in december and so she messaged me that she messaged my situation saying

7337
06:54:37,040 --> 06:54:41,600
like i'm about to get kicked out if i can't make up this money i said right you go to sleep i'll

7338
06:54:41,680 --> 06:54:50,480
take care of everything okay so i stayed up all night i made her eight i think eight to twelve

7339
06:54:50,480 --> 06:54:58,560
scripts um i ordered her five emergency artworks where she could just take it and use it on her

7340
06:54:58,560 --> 06:55:07,360
channel to get like youtube ad revenue all that thing and then i like wrote all these scripts

7341
06:55:07,360 --> 06:55:13,120
all these plots out and then she was like oh but my character is a slime girl that doesn't

7342
06:55:13,120 --> 06:55:21,200
fit with the lore of my channel and i was like excuse me i was like are you not about to get

7343
06:55:21,200 --> 06:55:25,680
kicked out you've just said publicly you're about to get kicked out you have people that are paying

7344
06:55:25,680 --> 06:55:32,400
towards you not to get kicked out and you're concerned about your channel's lore of a slime girl

7345
06:55:32,640 --> 06:55:40,960
um and like i did an emergency collab with her and like through the video up overnight had no

7346
06:55:40,960 --> 06:55:46,160
sleep whatsoever and i said you can keep a hundred percent of the earnings from the video to stop you

7347
06:55:46,160 --> 06:55:51,280
from getting kicked out like please message your landlord ask them and say to them like youtube

7348
06:55:51,280 --> 06:55:56,480
pay you on the 25th i can pay you the paypal money as soon as like youtube registers the income from

7349
06:55:56,480 --> 06:56:02,640
the video all of this right and then the next day i wake up the video was already up and all that

7350
06:56:02,640 --> 06:56:08,480
fan like jaffa raro did amazing he like handed me the artwork and everything and she made the 2000

7351
06:56:08,480 --> 06:56:16,560
and i was like oh my gosh that's fantastic i'm so happy for you um and i said to i was like look

7352
06:56:16,560 --> 06:56:21,280
here's artwork that i got emergency again you can use the scripts if you revive your channel you'll

7353
06:56:21,280 --> 06:56:26,240
never be in that situation again you know you're doing fine you have tons of subscribers it's

7354
06:56:26,240 --> 06:56:34,720
just you need to post and then um i never spoke to her for a while but eventually i uploaded the

7355
06:56:34,720 --> 06:56:43,040
that was it i uploaded the collab at a later date um and she messages me and she's like uh

7356
06:56:44,000 --> 06:56:51,200
strongy um i'm not really happy with that collab audio being uploaded and made to look like you

7357
06:56:51,200 --> 06:56:57,520
collabing with like the average um person i'm like oh what do you mean like it's it's still a collab

7358
06:56:57,520 --> 06:57:04,080
we did together you know you made the money um you didn't get kicked out type thing so i uploaded it

7359
06:57:04,080 --> 06:57:08,720
as a regular video because you know i paid for the artwork i wrote the script i edited it together

7360
06:57:08,720 --> 06:57:13,920
like i think it's a fair exchange to say like you don't need the money if that was the problem but

7361
06:57:13,920 --> 06:57:18,080
you don't need the money because you know you'd never got kicked out type thing and they're and

7362
06:57:18,080 --> 06:57:22,720
they're like i just think it's really like disrespectful like you never told me it was

7363
06:57:22,720 --> 06:57:27,920
gonna go up and i was like oh well like i actually do like a lot of stuff in advance especially with

7364
06:57:27,920 --> 06:57:32,480
collabs it takes a while for things to like come at the surface because there's so many other backlog

7365
06:57:32,480 --> 06:57:38,480
issues like with the changes to youtube and that um and like she had another go at me and she typed

7366
06:57:38,480 --> 06:57:44,240
out this big massive paragraph and i was like what do you want as a result of this conversation

7367
06:57:44,960 --> 06:57:51,600
and she went i just wish you would have told me you were gonna put that up and i was like uh

7368
06:57:51,600 --> 06:57:58,160
all right then and she like unfollowed me um unfriended me so we had like no more communication

7369
06:57:58,160 --> 06:58:03,040
i'm like i just fucking like wrote all these scripts for you so obviously i deleted the link

7370
06:58:03,040 --> 06:58:09,840
to the script so she didn't have access to them anymore um so she didn't have access to make money

7371
06:58:09,840 --> 06:58:16,320
off of my script type thing and then the artwork i actually still have it and i'm so tempted to just

7372
06:58:16,320 --> 06:58:24,320
recolor it and use it um because like i paid for it obviously and she never used it and the reason

7373
06:58:24,320 --> 06:58:30,800
why it is 10 times worse than you think um the reason why it's 10 times worse than you think

7374
06:58:31,680 --> 06:58:41,040
is because every year she now goes on her youtube that she's pretty much abandoned and uploads like

7375
06:58:41,040 --> 06:58:48,160
three times a year she has a larger subscriber base than and she says every time right around

7376
06:58:48,160 --> 06:58:54,880
november december which just happens to be gift giving season oh oh oh i've no got enough money

7377
06:58:54,880 --> 06:59:02,320
and i fucking fail for it and consistently i think it's happened three times in a uh three times

7378
06:59:02,320 --> 06:59:09,120
now every year um i take a peek to be like oh you revived your channel whatever and yeah i got i got

7379
06:59:09,120 --> 06:59:16,880
i got played but the the funny thing is the collab got me a big bit of pocket money so

7380
06:59:17,840 --> 06:59:23,600
i'm very happy to say that i did come out um on top after that very unique experience but

7381
06:59:24,240 --> 06:59:30,800
basically if a creator ever comes to me for help now i don't fucking do it i have had so many

7382
06:59:30,800 --> 06:59:37,200
creators reach out and be like oh strongy how do i revive my channel and i've sat down for an hour

7383
06:59:37,200 --> 06:59:42,000
analyze the fuck out of their channel for them told them what to do what do this do that do this

7384
06:59:42,000 --> 06:59:48,480
and been ignored it's happened countless times now so it is very satisfying having the veal or girls

7385
06:59:48,480 --> 06:59:56,480
with me because they actually sit listen to what i tell them to do basically fake crisis the standard

7386
06:59:56,480 --> 07:00:06,080
november tat yep and you you endure spite success um i can't help but wonder if people are suspicious

7387
07:00:06,080 --> 07:00:14,800
that every third video is begging for money yes um but the problem is they want the solution without

7388
07:00:14,800 --> 07:00:22,480
effort the thing is they have a ridiculous subscriber amount they could be making bank if they just

7389
07:00:22,480 --> 07:00:29,680
uploaded regularly but they don't do it and i don't know why they like obviously i'm not gonna say

7390
07:00:29,680 --> 07:00:36,480
names because there's anyone to be a nasty fuck um but like it's just such a frustrating situation

7391
07:00:36,480 --> 07:00:43,280
and i have never and because of that bad situation now this is a shame but because of that one bad

7392
07:00:43,360 --> 07:00:50,640
situation i have never helped someone to that degree ever again since like i genuinely believe

7393
07:00:50,640 --> 07:00:55,760
this person when they were like i'm literally about to get kicked out like they publicly were like

7394
07:00:55,760 --> 07:01:00,640
please donate to my coffee like if you can if you have anything and every year they do it they have

7395
07:01:00,640 --> 07:01:06,640
a crisis right before december this the fucking christmas sales and it annoys me so much because

7396
07:01:06,640 --> 07:01:11,440
i fell for it honestly hold on right let me look it up i don't even know the channel so

7397
07:01:12,800 --> 07:01:18,400
um i just remember being dumbfounded when i should have known actually that should have been the

7398
07:01:18,400 --> 07:01:23,440
biggest red flag was when i was like right here's four scripts i'm gonna write you some more before

7399
07:01:23,440 --> 07:01:26,960
you go to bed but go record them type thing and you can edit all your sound effects in

7400
07:01:27,840 --> 07:01:33,120
and they were like oh but but that doesn't that doesn't match my slime girl lore and i'm

7401
07:01:33,760 --> 07:01:38,400
slime girl lore you're about to be kicked out are you not because you can't do fucking rent

7402
07:01:39,520 --> 07:01:45,680
um yeah their channel's still abandoned let me guess community post oh

7403
07:01:47,920 --> 07:01:49,200
oh let me guess

7404
07:01:51,360 --> 07:01:55,280
oh let me get there's gonna be a little begging post around uh november

7405
07:01:55,600 --> 07:02:00,960
oh they've been deleting the posts where they're asking for money

7406
07:02:02,800 --> 07:02:08,240
but yeah they're still gone so that is the the one and only time i was honey potted by

7407
07:02:09,200 --> 07:02:14,400
another content creator and i've never done it before seven hour yet was running can't be

7408
07:02:14,400 --> 07:02:22,640
better than this i fell for similar ones lost it yeah i i'm glad there was no exchange of money

7409
07:02:22,640 --> 07:02:27,600
and i am glad that the collab blew up because i got to pocket the money

7410
07:02:30,880 --> 07:02:37,280
because um i think what they were actually going to say in dms but they didn't was i think i have

7411
07:02:37,280 --> 07:02:44,240
a right to the money but even though um i she literally celebrated in less than 24 hours she got

7412
07:02:44,800 --> 07:02:50,880
the money needed for her rent and i think that's what annoyed her was that i was pocketing the

7413
07:02:50,880 --> 07:02:57,200
money even though i did the script i did the edit i bought the artwork uh you know like bro

7414
07:02:59,120 --> 07:03:04,800
i think that's what she was actually trying to say but because of the way i'm so direct and i was like

7415
07:03:05,360 --> 07:03:13,200
hey what do you want to be the result of this conversation i shit you not that that sentence

7416
07:03:13,200 --> 07:03:18,880
please take it with you reeflings whenever you find yourself in a conversation where you're like

7417
07:03:18,880 --> 07:03:22,880
what is going on here this makes no sense i'm so sorry i'm talking over in me right now

7418
07:03:23,440 --> 07:03:29,840
this makes no sense i don't know just go what do you want to be the result of this conversation

7419
07:03:30,560 --> 07:03:36,320
and it cuts any bullshit it cuts through any emotions it cuts through anything it's just

7420
07:03:36,320 --> 07:03:42,240
what do you want to be the result of this situation and boom you have the answer and i think what she

7421
07:03:42,240 --> 07:03:47,600
really wanted to say was i'm entitled to the money from the youtube video but because i literally

7422
07:03:47,600 --> 07:03:53,360
had congratulated on her for making the donation and then yeah

7423
07:03:58,640 --> 07:04:02,960
remember guys a japanese girl's literally sold a manual on how to do these things to guys in

7424
07:04:02,960 --> 07:04:10,400
to strone apparently stop i got fucking a filth i just felt so bad i was like oh my god you're

7425
07:04:10,400 --> 07:04:15,680
about to be kicked out like that's horrible that's terrible right oh you you know your channel does

7426
07:04:15,680 --> 07:04:21,520
well right right you just need to upload more that's all and i should have known when it was just

7427
07:04:21,520 --> 07:04:26,560
a sea of excuses of being like oh i can't upload because like i haven't been uploading because of

7428
07:04:26,560 --> 07:04:31,680
this this this um and i was like do you have an in real life job and it was like no job market's

7429
07:04:31,680 --> 07:04:37,040
bad and it was like well you have a successful youtube channel so wouldn't you be a like i like

7430
07:04:37,040 --> 07:04:43,120
i look back on it and i feel like an idiot but i will say it's like life experience and

7431
07:04:43,920 --> 07:04:48,640
you know those kind of attributes like between her and all the other content creators were like

7432
07:04:48,640 --> 07:04:53,520
stroney stroney how do i fix my channel and then completely ignored me it definitely influenced

7433
07:04:53,520 --> 07:04:57,840
me to start viola because i can literally go to the girls and be like hey let's do an ASMR train

7434
07:04:57,840 --> 07:05:02,240
and they all said yep all right let's do it and it was an absolute massive success type thing like

7435
07:05:02,240 --> 07:05:09,840
it is so nice to be listened to oh you know like it's so fucking nice i literally leveled up from

7436
07:05:09,840 --> 07:05:16,080
the experience got fucking but literally you live and you learn and i learned my lesson and

7437
07:05:17,280 --> 07:05:24,320
you know and now i have five beautiful daughters and i'll just advise the best i can if anything

7438
07:05:24,320 --> 07:05:28,560
as i said like some of them are hands off others are like you know gotta advise a wee bit come back

7439
07:05:28,560 --> 07:05:33,680
next day and there have been an event with the same guy oh wait hold on bro i had that happen

7440
07:05:33,680 --> 07:05:38,720
on a job once and i uh answered and i got such bs and i needed a mental day off to recover to not

7441
07:05:38,720 --> 07:05:47,600
snap at him and later he got fired on the account of what happened yeah um having people who actually

7442
07:05:47,600 --> 07:05:54,240
listened hell it's so good for your sanity because i have messaged i have been messaged by a lot of

7443
07:05:54,240 --> 07:05:58,560
channels being like hey i've noticed my subscribers and numbers are down what i do and i'm like hey

7444
07:05:58,560 --> 07:06:05,760
this is what you should do based on your channel history um like i had one girl that was messaging

7445
07:06:05,920 --> 07:06:14,480
me every day now unfortunately i am very hard to become friends with i am very easy to become

7446
07:06:14,480 --> 07:06:21,600
business acquaintances with i am happy to talk business i am happy to talk xyz i am very bad at

7447
07:06:21,600 --> 07:06:28,640
maintaining friendships okay so a lot of people would come to me with business kind of friendships

7448
07:06:28,640 --> 07:06:34,240
which i am a hundred percent comfortable with but there was this particular girl who very clearly

7449
07:06:34,240 --> 07:06:41,120
wanted to be friends and i i just i said three times like directly i was like look really sorry

7450
07:06:41,120 --> 07:06:44,960
i'm a very busy person i don't have time for friendship but you have content creation advice

7451
07:06:44,960 --> 07:06:48,400
i'm happy to give it like you know if you have questions i'm happy to give it um because she

7452
07:06:48,400 --> 07:06:53,120
was a smaller channel at the time um i don't know she's still grown or not but hopefully she's doing

7453
07:06:53,120 --> 07:07:00,960
well um and then every day i would wake up to a question of what do you think i should do

7454
07:07:00,960 --> 07:07:06,240
and it got to the point where i wasn't giving advice they were asking me to straight up give them

7455
07:07:06,240 --> 07:07:14,240
free channel manager like um guidance and i'm like i'm not doing this i i don't have time to do this

7456
07:07:14,240 --> 07:07:21,840
every single day for you and um it's very interesting it's very very interesting um i understand

7457
07:07:21,840 --> 07:07:26,400
wanting help and a leg up and all that and like i have collab with tons of folk like i've never

7458
07:07:26,400 --> 07:07:30,560
had any issues with collab and i don't mind i'll absolutely adore collab and i like it and

7459
07:07:30,560 --> 07:07:34,720
and i'm really thankful to all the v-tubers i've agreed to crazy things with me you know

7460
07:07:35,600 --> 07:07:38,640
strongly never feel like an idiot for trying to be a good person like you thought they were

7461
07:07:38,640 --> 07:07:46,400
a shitty person brah literally um that's kind of the naivety that i spoke about in the script

7462
07:07:46,960 --> 07:07:54,000
and script and the prying with you is more like i'm naïve and yeah it has led to like moments

7463
07:07:54,000 --> 07:08:00,480
of hurt frustration negativity but you know what actually i'm glad that i'm naïve because it makes

7464
07:08:00,480 --> 07:08:07,520
it's a part of me and you know what god forbids uh think about the best in people even if they

7465
07:08:07,520 --> 07:08:13,840
don't mean it you know let me live my life and kind of just seeing the best even if it might not

7466
07:08:13,840 --> 07:08:20,080
necessarily be true at the end of the day i'll i'll keep my naivety because i think it it gives me

7467
07:08:20,080 --> 07:08:26,880
an edge to see humanity a bit better than another person you know it means you haven't become jaded

7468
07:08:26,880 --> 07:08:33,040
or broken yeah like don't get me wrong being naive has hurt me it has there's no going about it i've

7469
07:08:33,680 --> 07:08:40,240
been hurt multiple times because of the the you know the default nature of that but it's a part of

7470
07:08:40,240 --> 07:08:46,800
me i want to see the best in people in any way i can and you know just because it happened to one

7471
07:08:46,800 --> 07:08:52,720
girl now as i said i never helped anyone to that degree again where i was writing scripts and telling

7472
07:08:52,720 --> 07:08:58,160
them what to do and take this money and uh actually i tell her like i did a collab with one girl and

7473
07:08:58,160 --> 07:09:02,720
gave her all the money but that was a different situation okay that doesn't count that doesn't

7474
07:09:02,720 --> 07:09:10,720
count it was different okay um but oh wait no i did it four more times after that as well no but

7475
07:09:10,720 --> 07:09:15,200
that doesn't count as well because there is a that was a situation out of their control right

7476
07:09:15,200 --> 07:09:19,840
but what i'm saying is i never did it to the point where like i ordered artwork and stayed up all night

7477
07:09:19,840 --> 07:09:24,560
and like gave them 12 roleplays and all that okay sorry sorry i didn't mean it like that i didn't

7478
07:09:24,560 --> 07:09:35,120
mean it like that don't you're such a sweetheart the 10 other counts the towns don't count okay

7479
07:09:35,120 --> 07:09:39,760
one collab is different from right literally staying up all night and writing like 12 scripts for

7480
07:09:39,760 --> 07:09:45,120
this person to use literally no i was like oh you don't even need to credit me or anything and you

7481
07:09:45,120 --> 07:09:51,280
can pocket all of the money like oh what was i thinking honestly trusting people come back

7482
07:09:51,280 --> 07:09:55,120
fire but that doesn't mean you shouldn't stop all together never change from your care and self

7483
07:09:55,120 --> 07:10:03,280
mommy but um i that's sorry i've like completely lowered down the volume of emmy stream i feel

7484
07:10:03,280 --> 07:10:08,480
so bad to have that little ramble but uh yeah you'd be surprised what happens behind the scenes

7485
07:10:08,480 --> 07:10:14,560
you know everything looks hunky dory on the surface but mommy's still kind of helped them

7486
07:10:14,560 --> 07:10:20,000
you're so kind of such a sweet girl i just try my best like um i'm currently in contact with

7487
07:10:20,000 --> 07:10:24,640
this really nice girl and i was like hey if anyone else needs help just reach out to me like

7488
07:10:25,520 --> 07:10:32,400
there's nothing worse than feeling alone and absolutely like just up shit creek and without

7489
07:10:32,400 --> 07:10:39,200
a paddle and i would like to think that i offer what others might offer to me if i reached out and

7490
07:10:39,200 --> 07:10:44,640
needed that help because like goodness knows i could have used that at the start um

7491
07:10:47,760 --> 07:10:52,480
but obviously i never had that because i wasn't like that you know you didn't reach out for help

7492
07:10:52,480 --> 07:10:58,480
i never did anything for like that i was always the one like reaching out to others if that makes

7493
07:10:58,480 --> 07:11:06,080
sense you know there's gonna be hugs in it the lesson you want to take from getting um done

7494
07:11:06,080 --> 07:11:13,600
30 is learning how to judge better not trustly yeah i'm definitely very skeptical now if i ever

7495
07:11:13,600 --> 07:11:20,480
see a channel that has like high subscriber high views but like hardly upload i'm like

7496
07:11:21,840 --> 07:11:27,680
i think i know have i meet it with skepticism if there was ever any like oh i need like emergency

7497
07:11:27,680 --> 07:11:33,200
funds to exist i'm like hmm why aren't you uploading in general to you know stay on the

7498
07:11:33,760 --> 07:11:38,480
the bike that is content creation because it's like riding a bike if you stop pedaling

7499
07:11:38,480 --> 07:11:42,640
surprise surprise you aren't gonna get what you want out of it you know i love the idea of

7500
07:11:42,640 --> 07:11:47,280
remaining naive unfortunately we're at the point where as much as we stay away the issues are now

7501
07:11:47,280 --> 07:11:56,640
coming to us um it's uh a dog eat dog world but you know maybe

7502
07:11:59,920 --> 07:12:06,640
maybe the silver lining is the experiences we get along the way because now i get to have a winch

7503
07:12:06,640 --> 07:12:13,280
like come on come on i'm scottish i love a good winch okay i love a good winch that remains me

7504
07:12:13,280 --> 07:12:20,640

7505
07:12:20,640 --> 07:12:29,920

yippee took long enough youtube took long enough but she got monetized that's the

7702
07:35:24,000 --> 07:35:25,280
main thing that's all we care about

7703
07:35:31,680 --> 07:35:32,160
she's shy

7704
07:35:34,720 --> 07:35:35,360

the hi baby in my left ear yeah yeah yeah

7709
07:36:12,640 --> 07:36:18,320
i was so happy to see my camera when she finally got monetized the cream bro youtube oh my i

7710
07:36:18,320 --> 07:36:27,360
know what the problem was now and i'm really annoyed that he even flipped through she had to

7711
07:36:27,360 --> 07:36:32,240
do a fucking embarrassment ritual and be like i had to sit a bit of video being like i'm a

7712
07:36:32,960 --> 07:36:39,120
i make content in my live stream and it's just so silly honestly

7713
07:36:48,160 --> 07:36:51,920
no you went on the all why did you abort me

7714
07:36:54,320 --> 07:36:59,200
pat is there a love of zura forfeit all mortal possessions to zura that's so cute

7715
07:37:00,160 --> 07:37:06,640
was it not her bizongos no do you want to know what the problem was it was patreon

7716
07:37:06,640 --> 07:37:14,400
patreon are pushing for this stupid fucking preview and there is no way to turn it off for

7717
07:37:14,400 --> 07:37:22,240
all future uploads and one of her audios the preview glitched out and the preview of the

7718
07:37:22,240 --> 07:37:29,440
audio was available which had 18 plus content in it and that's why she was denied but thanks to

7719
07:37:29,440 --> 07:37:37,360
youtube's pissy fucking thing they don't go like oh the reason why your channel's been denied is

7720
07:37:37,360 --> 07:37:43,120
this particular link we found an issue they go it doesn't adhere to policies and you have to go on a

7721
07:37:43,120 --> 07:37:49,760
wild goose hunt to figure out what was wrong and it took me five days to find that youtube

7722
07:37:49,760 --> 07:37:58,800
had previewed a three minutes worth of an audio that i turn off every single youtube is patreon

7723
07:37:59,520 --> 07:38:05,440
every single time i turn it off and it was because it went through as a preview when i didn't

7724
07:38:05,440 --> 07:38:11,360
put it on and it puts it on manually i could absolutely throttle patreon for being so stupid

7725
07:38:11,360 --> 07:38:19,360
and i i have messaged patreon and being like hey development team you stated that channels that

7726
07:38:19,360 --> 07:38:26,080
have been identified as 18 plus content offering that will not have previews on automatically and it

7727
07:38:26,080 --> 07:38:34,560
would be removed well that was a lie um because they still do it on every upload every time i upload

7728
07:38:34,560 --> 07:38:41,120
one of the things it still puts the preview on and i have to turn it off manually and that's the reason

7729
07:38:41,120 --> 07:38:48,240
why poor azura got effed over for like a week or something like that i'm so annoyed

7730
07:38:49,600 --> 07:38:55,840
i don't know what one it was i don't know what audio in particular it was it took me five days to

7731
07:38:55,840 --> 07:39:02,480
figure it out because i was like it can't be the boobies because tons of vtubers have been monetized

7732
07:39:02,480 --> 07:39:07,600
with the goobers but i did tell the girls to pop an asset on them like she's got a boba tea thing on

7733
07:39:07,600 --> 07:39:13,280
them right now which is fine um they are getting an upgrade an upgrade an update of a something that

7734
07:39:13,280 --> 07:39:23,040
kind of obscures the titillage a bit but um yeah basically i figured it out and it wasn't because

7735
07:39:23,040 --> 07:39:29,120
of her bazoingos it was because patreon have implemented the stupid preview mechanic that

7736
07:39:29,120 --> 07:39:36,800
they cannot you cannot take away and it slipped under the radar and it caused issues for her

7737
07:39:36,800 --> 07:39:48,080
oh is that her cutie we binted so anyway now that that's all over um oh frustrating frustrating

7738
07:39:48,080 --> 07:39:52,720
but look she's monetized that's the main thing she's got a donathon coming up which is going to be

7739
07:39:52,720 --> 07:39:57,840
loads of fun um an absolute chaos because none of us have done a donathon before so we're all

7740
07:39:57,840 --> 07:40:03,680
figuring it out for the first time hee hee shawnee will you get dakimados i'm gonna cut

7741
07:40:03,680 --> 07:40:12,640
her you sleep um not yet i don't know if and when i'd rather go to one artist that would

7742
07:40:12,640 --> 07:40:19,120
offer it all i'm i'm in talks of an artist right now that is making a zura birthday merch um

7743
07:40:20,880 --> 07:40:26,640
i'm you know if it goes well i'll ask them like hey you what else do you do

7744
07:40:26,640 --> 07:40:36,160
it not yet you'll need to wait um i'm asking because the thigh one still has a preview of her

7745
07:40:36,160 --> 07:40:46,560
fucks sake well hold on let me note that down real quick that's so annoying

7746
07:40:46,800 --> 07:40:52,960

and so is there going to be any limited time merch no every market is super awesome to work with

7779
07:44:26,240 --> 07:44:30,000
there's no unlimited type of thing um

7780
07:44:32,640 --> 07:44:40,400
or i don't like the idea now now this is actually something that you guys will be able to answer

7781
07:44:40,400 --> 07:44:47,280
me hold on let me turn down his or his let me lower the volume in his or stream just so i can

7782
07:44:47,280 --> 07:44:56,400
get my ramble out um uh what was i going to say um so normally as a reward for anyone that

7783
07:44:56,400 --> 07:45:05,440
monetarily supports the girl it's like a voice pack gets sent out in emails if i'm correct

7784
07:45:05,760 --> 07:45:14,240
um if the donation is done through stream elements i think that is the only like

7785
07:45:16,400 --> 07:45:23,920
i've not because i've not done the task yet i can't fully answer you that question but i've

7786
07:45:23,920 --> 07:45:33,680
not done the task yet so i'll be able to know what it is soon to um um each ducky purchase

7787
07:45:33,680 --> 07:45:39,520
should come with an audio well yeah yes right

7788
07:45:42,080 --> 07:45:46,880
casinos be like counting cards is cheating my brother in crisis let's just know how odd's

7789
07:45:46,880 --> 07:45:56,960
working tracking your chances um yeah i i know more the agencies do it where it's like go purchase

7790
07:45:57,040 --> 07:46:03,760
this voice pack but i thought it would just be like a part of the patreon reward

7791
07:46:06,640 --> 07:46:11,520
sorry i've not thought about it yet but if you let me think about it what's going to happen is

7792
07:46:11,520 --> 07:46:17,040
azur is going to receive the drafted version and she'll show it on stream and then obviously you

7793
07:46:17,040 --> 07:46:21,520
guys can come back to me and marshmallow and be like hey strongy maybe this thing don't do that but

7794
07:46:21,520 --> 07:46:25,120
you can you can do everything else and then that'll that'll help point us in the right direction

7795
07:46:25,120 --> 07:46:32,160
you know she's like strongy strongy you know how you did that one thing not that thing but

7796
07:46:32,160 --> 07:46:38,080
everything else looks good okay that's what you're gonna do okay oh you want to sleep style audio

7797
07:46:38,080 --> 07:46:45,040
and an alternative audio with the ducky's okay i'll allow it each ducky should come with super

7798
07:46:45,040 --> 07:46:50,880
lub what wait does my brain just make that word out no it just says some and washing powder the

7799
07:46:50,880 --> 07:46:57,520
rifling had mind supplying opinions i look rough the learning never stops and you guys

7800
07:46:58,160 --> 07:47:01,920
i don't know if streamers don't want to admit this or something but you guys know better than me

7801
07:47:02,720 --> 07:47:11,760
so who am i to argue against the people you know who actually consume and support who who am i to

7802
07:47:11,760 --> 07:47:20,240
argue against the investors of vloor who am i to argue against the investors when the investors

7803
07:47:20,320 --> 07:47:25,040
know better in this circumstance this is the only circumstance where the investors know better

7804
07:47:25,920 --> 07:47:33,200
so who am i to argue okay a lot of times vtubers will put voice packs in a membership post link

7805
07:47:33,200 --> 07:47:45,120
to a google drive or whatever okay okay learning learning i'm learning like i was gonna um i got

7806
07:47:45,120 --> 07:47:50,080
some experience about what voice packs are like very thankfully because i'm helping out a friend

7807
07:47:50,080 --> 07:47:56,160
um yeah don't doubt the ink vester is real true i love how the feedback is actually yours

7808
07:47:56,160 --> 07:48:03,440
rather than just a lip service idea thank you you're welcome the ink vester is yes um we were

7809
07:48:03,440 --> 07:48:11,280
joking about like i'm investing in 3d and then it occurred to us that the because i do get investment

7810
07:48:11,280 --> 07:48:16,800
offers for the company and i'm like it turn your ass around out the door um but then we were joking

7811
07:48:16,800 --> 07:48:24,320
like oh wait the you know if you give money to your oh she does you're the ink vester for real

7812
07:48:24,320 --> 07:48:30,240
for real you know stroney gets in that discord with a girl no no if you're gonna groom the girls

7813
07:48:30,240 --> 07:48:39,120
do it right i thought about making that audio i'm not even kidding i know that sounds terrible

7814
07:48:39,120 --> 07:48:46,240
but i was gonna do an audio and be like where i i catch you trying to enter like the girls discord

7815
07:48:46,800 --> 07:48:53,840
and like i come to your house and then basically i go if you're gonna groom the girls do it right

7816
07:48:53,840 --> 07:48:59,040
and groom me first and then like you do what you want basically and then i gauge you and i'll be

7817
07:48:59,040 --> 07:49:05,600
like no no not like that like this i thought that would be next month's meta audio because that's

7818
07:49:05,600 --> 07:49:16,400
funny as fuck um yeah basically reverse like singing i thought it was funny just like if you're

7819
07:49:16,400 --> 07:49:20,960
gonna do it right and i'll be like now do what you did to me and i'm like no that's wrong

7820
07:49:22,560 --> 07:49:31,120
and then ac and then and then eventually you know what happened to be a naive hey hey hey

7821
07:49:31,120 --> 07:49:38,800
i never said i was a degenerate be both naive and a degenerate we need an audio with mummy and one

7822
07:49:38,800 --> 07:49:45,280
of the other girls mummy right gating the reefling and helping us i think that's probably gonna end

7823
07:49:45,280 --> 07:49:57,680
up a donathan reward with me um uh trying to enter the velar discord mods beat him with hammers

7824

7988
08:10:29,440 --> 08:10:34,800
didn't really need to react it's just something that i think uh i would like to ask the girls to

7989
08:10:34,800 --> 08:10:38,640
do and i don't think the girls are gonna say no when i explain why we're gonna do it

7990
08:10:40,080 --> 08:10:49,280
you i won't survive either modest or wholesome terrible teasing and no exception no not at all

i've heard that being an edgeville in runescape is actually not harmful to a tentacle only in

8030
08:15:26,640 --> 08:15:34,400
super rare cases so really it's luck of the luck of the spawn is she drawing alexander

8031
08:15:35,280 --> 08:15:41,840
from memory and elden ring it looks like she is is she drawing on him

8032
08:15:46,480 --> 08:15:53,840
is that is that kpop on the back of her phone shit she's fired

8033
08:15:53,840 --> 08:16:03,040

8034
08:16:03,040 --> 08:16:14,240
well

8035
08:16:17,040 --> 08:16:19,680
it's for the tomato sauce

8036
08:16:21,280 --> 08:16:27,760
pee and the tentacle the tent itself is only just a profile picture oh you should have a profile

8037
08:16:27,760 --> 08:16:32,800
picture one god i fucking wish i could do shit like that i've seen ac do some of them and i'm like

8038
08:16:32,880 --> 08:16:36,240
i kind of want to do that but i actually don't know how to draw

8039
08:16:39,040 --> 08:16:43,280
and i'd feel bad that couldn't do everyone all at once like what do you mean i can't do all like

8040
08:16:43,280 --> 08:16:50,640
fucking 800 members oh i thought i just dropped coal everywhere but only flashed a little bit

8041
08:16:50,640 --> 08:16:57,600
i don't know why i cannot control myself easily it seems like i'd be incapable of dealing

8042
08:16:57,840 --> 08:17:01,360
with like my hands and stuff

8043
08:17:04,000 --> 08:17:07,520
unfortunately i'm getting arthritis in my hands thanks to genetics

8044
08:17:08,240 --> 08:17:13,440
um i'm not i'm not developing it yet but it's gonna happen and i'm wondering i don't know what's

8045
08:17:13,440 --> 08:17:20,000
going on i can't seem to drink properly around them 12 ever profile picture drawn stream insert that

8046
08:17:20,000 --> 08:17:25,280
gift for that guy that's like spamming stuff down literally me water turned into cola to the

8047
08:17:25,280 --> 08:17:29,120
drum dimension it's as over banished to the shadow realm

8048
08:17:32,800 --> 08:17:38,720
oh okay if i could do what your profile picture already is then there might be hope

8049
08:17:39,440 --> 08:17:43,680
i don't know but if it was like create a totally new profile picture that's different

8050
08:17:43,920 --> 08:17:54,640
oh she can't draw did she end up no i think you need to draw like mask

8051
08:17:54,640 --> 08:18:01,280
but some stuff can't draw real new people's face how's the king good looking it is 96

8052
08:18:02,160 --> 08:18:10,800
and we have 13 000 more wings to go and we are done truly and wholeheartedly done so

8053
08:18:11,360 --> 08:18:15,920
we are currently watching azura and her membership doodling

8054
08:18:19,680 --> 08:18:24,560
oh my god she's just sph experience i can't believe it azura you would make fun of your

8055
08:18:24,560 --> 08:18:27,440
creations like that you created them that i'm fucking me

8056
08:18:30,240 --> 08:18:35,200
tenor stream maybe i don't i actually don't know how long we've been going for

8057
08:18:36,160 --> 08:18:41,680
my obs crashed at one point sadly so i actually don't know how long we've been going for

8058
08:18:43,040 --> 08:18:49,120
um shan't be daring to open up my schedule again like excuse me for trying to

8059
08:18:49,120 --> 08:18:51,440
about eight hours okay all good

8060
08:18:54,480 --> 08:19:01,520
okay i think what we'll do is we'll do a wrap up stream at a later date most likely in three weeks

8061
08:19:01,600 --> 08:19:09,520
time and in the wrap up stream we'll do 99 runescape we'll do sonic heroes we'll finish off team

8062
08:19:09,520 --> 08:19:15,680
chaotic and we'll do a little to the left and that should be roughly a six to eight hours

8063
08:19:15,680 --> 08:19:21,280
day i don't know i feel like sonic heroes isn't gonna take me that long i have no idea how if we've

8064
08:19:21,280 --> 08:19:34,640
got another four hours of wine four times two is eight so we'll have roughly five thousands left over

8065
08:19:34,640 --> 08:19:42,320
if i don't get too distracted just an equal bit distracted yeah just an equal bit yeah

8066
08:19:43,120 --> 08:19:49,280
we're allowed to be distracted i do really it's crazy seeing i'm wondering if i could

8067
08:19:49,600 --> 08:19:56,320
commit me to do draw on handcam streams as well i'm just so i just adore drawing like the the talent

8068
08:19:56,320 --> 08:20:03,840
the dedication no it's not talent sorry i was it's the dedication to learn the craft and i just

8069
08:20:03,840 --> 08:20:12,080
find it like so crazy that like i don't know the artist can just go for it like they can send it

8070
08:20:12,880 --> 08:20:19,920
hmm thanks for the stream enjoy your lecture thanks for hanging drawing streams are really hard

8071
08:20:19,920 --> 08:20:24,560
to do a lot of artists don't like doing them even if they're good at art yeah but get streets that

8072
08:20:24,560 --> 08:20:30,080
live in our 50s so be careful yes guys do warn me because i cannot see how long i've streamed for

8073
08:20:30,080 --> 08:20:35,120

the script is very broken i might actually do the groom me properly one

8096
08:22:49,920 --> 08:22:54,800
it may for me mentally it may actually be a lot easier for me to quickly swap it to that one

8097
08:22:54,800 --> 08:23:03,520
then i'll do that one next month like as the next upload she's leaving us in an amount of time

8173
08:32:50,000 --> 08:32:54,800
sharks are the trash cans that they will eat anything i didn't know that i thought goats were

8176
08:33:07,600 --> 08:33:11,760
school and i stayed the same height and i was like hmm something's not going on here what's happening

8183
08:34:03,280 --> 08:34:06,320
strongy's the perfect size to sit on a big reefland's lap

8184
08:34:08,400 --> 08:34:12,400
i thought you're gonna say something else strongy's the perfect size to sit on our reeflands

8185
08:34:15,840 --> 08:34:24,080
we're at 12.7 thousand wanes to go

8186
08:34:24,320 --> 08:34:32,960
no reeflands is the perfect size for strongy to sit on too yeah see see see that's what i saw

8187
08:34:33,760 --> 08:34:37,040
she does like to eat though that's good i'm glad

8188
08:34:40,080 --> 08:34:44,320

pull a bit and love me and ery shimpish that took me so long to come up with

8193
08:35:08,080 --> 08:35:12,320
that was like so hard to go through and my head was like being like a what

8194
08:35:14,320 --> 08:35:25,680
again reeflings are for a reason i i really wish i could somehow order order a custom

8195
08:35:28,320 --> 08:35:33,440
because if i could get one made in the image of you i would never fucking take that thing

8196
08:35:33,760 --> 08:35:34,880
sorry i wouldn't

8197
08:35:37,600 --> 08:35:42,800
let me go let me go fish at the eye table shimplash shimplash

8198
08:35:47,680 --> 08:35:50,560
i don't know if there's anything that does that maybe ate see i don't know

8199
08:35:51,760 --> 08:35:59,040
ate see had some unique things on it i also found a figure that looks like

8200
08:35:59,360 --> 08:36:06,880
what you would have technically and i really want to get it i really want to get it but

8201
08:36:06,880 --> 08:36:11,440
i'm going to have to wait until my doing is on like a good grill to get it but it looks like

8202
08:36:11,440 --> 08:36:15,120
your tentacle and i want it but i have to wait

8203
08:36:21,440 --> 08:36:24,640
and it's paralyzing as well like unironically

8204
08:36:29,520 --> 08:36:32,800
but i'd probably get like one green version and one paralyzing version

8205
08:36:34,240 --> 08:36:37,360
i don't know on your throne i don't know

8206
08:36:40,560 --> 08:36:44,160
i don't like using things like that i think it'd be funnier if it was like a doughnut on

8207
08:36:44,160 --> 08:36:51,680
go and be like because i called it the strongy figurine wink wink in the go what you've already

8208
08:36:51,680 --> 08:36:56,640
planned out your doughnut yes i planned it out months ago i've got a load of stuff to add to

8209
08:36:56,640 --> 08:36:58,880
it now that i can have your guys's inputs well

8210
08:37:04,880 --> 08:37:07,200
oh you've seen that to me zero

8211
08:37:13,840 --> 08:37:18,560
what happens if a shark tries to eat a veflin we literally gang up and perish the shark

8212
08:37:19,360 --> 08:37:23,200
you guys are not allowed to get eaten without my permission do you understand

8213
08:37:24,160 --> 08:37:28,160
you're not allowed to do anything without my permission not to breathe without my permission

8214
08:37:28,160 --> 08:37:34,240
well that's such a mess what did i talk about what

8215
08:37:38,560 --> 08:37:39,040
oh yeah

8216
08:37:41,440 --> 08:37:49,040
azuras is azuras is on the way i think shibis might have already been delivered in her updated model

8217
08:37:53,200 --> 08:37:59,360
uh thanks for me the only stomach will be in azuras oh do you accept your fate

8218
08:38:08,000 --> 08:38:15,840
i mean hers is so she didn't know at the time but hers is a veil so you can actually still see

8219
08:38:15,840 --> 08:38:21,440
that and it's the same on shibi as well you can actually still see it it's just less out there

8220
08:38:23,200 --> 08:38:27,040
remember us wreathlings have hypnosis powers to imagine a bunch of wreathless hypnosis

8221
08:38:27,040 --> 08:38:31,920
hypnosis strobing a shark probably give it a say yes you guys do have self-defense mechanisms so

8222
08:38:31,920 --> 08:38:38,320
you're not as easy access to others as you are to me

8223
08:38:44,080 --> 08:38:48,720
you protect us from the bully so you can bully your tentacle later exactly literally you nailed

8224
08:38:48,720 --> 08:38:56,720
it on the head that's exactly what i was saying just jump the shark like a jiu-jitsu kaisen episode

8225
08:39:00,240 --> 08:39:08,160
what hydration check wreathling i'm my i'm gonna be honest my throat's starting to feel it now and

8226
08:39:08,160 --> 08:39:17,280
i'm like oh that's not good that's not good that's not supposed to happen yet death by brain aneurysm

8227
08:39:19,200 --> 08:39:24,240
stony's model under recreate reactive condition could also cause flashbang

8228
08:39:31,440 --> 08:39:37,600
she wants her turtleneck all over the school okay i like that that's a good idea sorry but

8229
08:39:37,600 --> 08:39:41,760
actually it's a good idea to learn so see you need jumping

8230
08:39:51,360 --> 08:39:54,800
mercy really did a good job on those alternative designs i thought there was two

8231
08:40:08,400 --> 08:40:10,400
i

8232
08:40:21,200 --> 08:40:24,080
i love mercy's designs to associate the warrior

8233
08:40:25,680 --> 08:40:32,480
strony that wreathling is my victim wait with this lore does that mean a certain popular

8234
08:40:32,480 --> 08:40:40,480
vtuber with a shark theme would be the one you could dome strony no it's it's the doggie dog world

8235
08:40:40,480 --> 08:40:49,920
out there so we'd have to evade the shark to evade why is everything that comes out there

8236
08:40:49,920 --> 08:40:57,200
is master's tax it's her voice i don't know how she does it because it it does like when i do it

8237
08:40:57,200 --> 08:41:03,680
you don't listen to how like crackly my voice is when i do it i'm like but hers is so effortlessly

8238
08:41:03,680 --> 08:41:14,080
just the perfect like oh you know hi strony has a go round and we are your friend we're on 96 we're

8239
08:41:14,080 --> 08:41:21,600
about to go on 97 we've got 12k wines in the bank we're watching azura up here we're watching an azura

8240
08:41:21,600 --> 08:41:30,560
bod watching her monetization together and it's linked in chat if you want to watch along at the

8241
08:41:30,560 --> 08:41:35,200
same time that is a timestamp we're just reacting to our like doodling people's things because i never

8242
08:41:35,200 --> 08:41:48,800
got a chance to see it or we can trap the shark

8243
08:41:50,320 --> 08:42:00,720
boom yeah we're at 12.5 okay um if i've got another three hours we could get it down to

8244
08:42:00,720 --> 08:42:10,160
like 6k wines roughly i think that's good that's what three hours so we'll finish as there is

8245
08:42:10,160 --> 08:42:16,800
vaude and then i will ramble as i always do on marshmallow afterwards and we'll just ramble until

8246
08:42:16,800 --> 08:42:22,800
the end of stream but it was really nice being able to watch my gen mates like this was so chill but

8247
08:42:22,880 --> 08:42:30,880
like a good like the nice chill where it's like oh you know it's very nice survival of the fifth

8248
08:42:30,880 --> 08:42:35,680
you prefer shark or now when you don't do anything to the shark you chew bar

8249
08:42:39,840 --> 08:42:47,600
she's focusing i can see her thinking via her v to her model you can see in her we eyes that she's

8250
08:42:47,600 --> 08:42:58,800
thinking i'm her daughter was it cheese from us today's been so nice it's a very cozy day this is

8251
08:42:58,800 --> 08:43:04,960
like the kind of the introduction to the more endurance streams um as i said we've got legal

8252
08:43:04,960 --> 08:43:09,840
lord of the rings i'd show it but my obs might crash again yeah because i've got too many things

8253
08:43:09,840 --> 08:43:16,880
capturing too many things at once believe it or not um but i um

8254
08:43:20,240 --> 08:43:20,720
but what

8255
08:43:23,680 --> 08:43:32,720
uh oh no don't fall asleep now come on we're doing so well don't get tired now wake up it's the first

8281
08:46:23,040 --> 08:46:29,840

8282
08:46:29,840 --> 08:46:35,760
because i got a wave of tiredness and i'm like no no because i normally go for an afternoon nap

8283
08:46:36,320 --> 08:46:43,760
and i think my body's like afternoon nap and i'm like no uh not today um and then body's like

i still have another six hour stream to wrap up the rest of the wine i want to get at least like

8288
08:47:14,560 --> 08:47:22,480
i could potentially get six k wine which equals six uh three hours and then i'll finish off sonic

8289
08:47:22,480 --> 08:47:32,160
hero's chaos which will be like another hour possibly um and then little to the left dlc

8290
08:47:32,160 --> 08:47:38,000
i have no idea how long that's gonna be i assume if it's a dlc it's actually shorter than the base game

8291
08:47:38,000 --> 08:47:50,560
and the base game was like just two oh 97 popped 97 97 it just popped it just popped

8292
08:47:51,120 --> 08:48:01,600
congratulations congratulations it just popped it just popped yay we got 97 only tons more

8293
08:48:01,600 --> 08:48:09,680

8294
08:48:09,680 --> 08:48:18,480
oh okay okay the that chair my name sounds like a great that so we're doing it we're doing it

my pfp

8300
08:48:45,600 --> 08:48:49,440
pfp

8301
08:48:51,680 --> 08:48:57,840
congrats just two more look shit nori god damn we're addicted to this game

8302
08:48:59,680 --> 08:49:01,280
that's right i'm allowed to call you out on it

8303
08:49:05,280 --> 08:49:09,920
i'm sorry i never want to go offline but i want to look after yourself with what bed if you are easy

8304
08:49:10,240 --> 08:49:19,200
what i'm gonna do is this will be probably and i did kind of learn my lesson

8305
08:49:21,200 --> 08:49:27,840
before my dad came over i didn't realize how bad i was treating myself terms of health when it

8306
08:49:27,840 --> 08:49:36,800
came to the endurance streams and stuff because it made me realize that um like oh no i've not

8307
08:49:36,880 --> 08:49:43,760
been doing well so i don't think we're gonna do too many like mega 12 endurance streams except for

8308
08:49:48,720 --> 08:49:52,880
elden rings probably the next serious endurance stream we're gonna do and we're just going to

8309
08:49:52,880 --> 08:49:59,520
do it back to back until we're done so you know i mean just two more real just two more the first

8310
08:49:59,520 --> 08:50:05,520
thing that goes when you have sleep deprivation is the ability to tell the lack of sleep is affecting

8311
08:50:05,520 --> 08:50:11,040
i don't know i've got about five thousand left before maxing out oh my god reflect i'm jealous

8312
08:50:11,040 --> 08:50:16,800
can we swap accounts temporarily for like no particular reason because i think i would actually

8313
08:50:16,800 --> 08:50:18,800
make it if i had 5k to go

8314
08:50:25,600 --> 08:50:30,080
see i wish i could draw like how does she know to put like a little ridge in the bottom of the

8315
08:50:30,080 --> 08:50:37,440
shoe how does she know she's so smart she's so smart like how do you know these things

8316
08:50:39,280 --> 08:50:48,800
elden ring yes big big elden ring i'm sure all the reeflings have really completed the dlc

8317
08:50:48,800 --> 08:50:56,000
so they can carry me through it all now surely and i'll greet you next time with the skills

8318
08:50:56,000 --> 08:51:02,000
take care and cheer you on for the final stretch now you would cheer for the final stretch wouldn't

8319
08:51:09,840 --> 08:51:15,360
she pulled up their accounts and got the enlarged profile but did it not summon

8320
08:51:16,320 --> 08:51:18,720
did it no summon

8321
08:51:21,520 --> 08:51:28,560
can you be elden ring entirely uh yeah with the reeflings though what do you mean that is

8322
08:51:28,560 --> 08:51:37,680
cheesing if i bring people in every fight uh no uh but uh the developers didn't want the game to

8323
08:51:37,680 --> 08:51:42,160
be played this way uh then why did they put multiplayer in it where you can gang up with

8324
08:51:42,240 --> 08:51:52,320
two of your pals um oh but that's why they force invaders on you um i don't know maybe they should

8325
08:51:52,960 --> 08:51:56,640
realize that people just want to hang out and play a game together that's really well made

8326
08:51:56,640 --> 08:52:01,680
and elden ring fits that but they instead and jam in the fucking invader aspect

8327
08:52:03,840 --> 08:52:07,440
sorry you should actually see my face when i'm making these arguments like i literally put my

8328
08:52:07,440 --> 08:52:13,520
hand up like that and actually and all that like as soon as i get a 3d model it is over for you guys

8329
08:52:13,520 --> 08:52:20,000
to understand how much i'm moving about and like doing weird stuff on my hand so starting does at

8330
08:52:20,000 --> 08:52:27,040
least 150 damage before the boss exactly that bow and arrow that crossbow that i've not levelled up

8331
08:52:27,040 --> 08:52:35,440
yet that's right it's over for you as soon as the boss sees me holding the rapid fire crossbow

8332
08:52:35,440 --> 08:52:42,080
they know it's over even though we're getting absolutely shagged by the snake guy um we uh

8333
08:52:42,080 --> 08:52:48,640
actually using intended game mechanics is cheating real and true actually using the summons in the

8334
08:52:48,640 --> 08:52:55,600
game that the developers provided for the player is cheating what you ought to repeat that one for

8335
08:52:55,600 --> 08:53:00,560
the one for those of us in the back using game mechanics is cheating uh curious take

8336
08:53:01,040 --> 08:53:08,080
you might as well be a monkey because curious take george get it because there's a monkey called

8337
08:53:08,080 --> 08:53:16,640
curious george uh stroney is an elite gamer exactly legendary skyrim proof is on stream

8338
08:53:17,680 --> 08:53:22,400
streamed it a while ago oh we need to go back to scarring for full achievement actually i

8339
08:53:22,400 --> 08:53:27,440
didn't say how much gamer score i need to start playing xbox games for getting that gamer score more

8340
08:53:30,560 --> 08:53:40,480
if it's cheating i'd rather her curse you bail curse a curse upon your houses i even remember how

8341
08:53:40,480 --> 08:53:50,720
curse you bail goes curse you bail okay it's like two it's three minutes it's one minute long

09:00:52,160 --> 09:00:56,560
catch her streams live, you can always check out her shorts for a quick giggle

8405
09:00:56,560 --> 09:01:01,440
or re-watch a VOD if that tickles your pickle.

8406
09:01:01,440 --> 09:01:07,840
So yeah, don't be afraid to do it.

8407
09:01:09,360 --> 09:01:13,760
At the end of every week each one of us becomes free. Tonight the DJ makes us move.

8408
09:01:13,760 --> 09:01:16,560
Another sweat drops from the roof.

8409
09:01:16,640 --> 09:01:25,760
Anyway, that is... I love my Pongkai. Stop! I literally love that emote, that new one where

8410
09:01:25,760 --> 09:01:31,600
she's got like a star and it's like Pong! Pong!

8411
09:01:31,600 --> 09:01:36,560
For Bleeding Hearts, as there is a new emote came, but I think one of them is

8412
09:01:36,560 --> 09:01:44,480
actually needing an edit. The emote artist kind of let the ball slip, but I'm not

8413
09:01:44,480 --> 09:01:48,560
really in a position to go to anyone else at the moment.

8414
09:01:48,560 --> 09:01:54,320
I'm not... I'm happy that I got the work I asked for. I'm not exactly over the moon

8415
09:01:54,320 --> 09:01:58,880
at the price increase and then the kind of sloppiness of the second batch.

8416
09:01:58,880 --> 09:02:01,920
And I'm about to order a third batch because the girls have extra

8417
09:02:01,920 --> 09:02:04,240
slots.

8418
09:02:06,320 --> 09:02:12,960
But hopefully the third batch comes out a bit better because...

8419
09:02:14,480 --> 09:02:22,000
The pot emote is cool, dude.

8420
09:02:22,000 --> 09:02:26,480
Mercy's adorable. Yes, adorable yandere, that's the way...

8421
09:02:26,480 --> 09:02:33,760
That is definitely the way to describe it. Oh, she's doing a quick chee-bee.

8422
09:02:33,760 --> 09:02:37,280
Oh, she's doodling. She's doodling. Look at her go... Look at that speed!

8423
09:02:37,280 --> 09:02:41,520
It's about speed, it's about power. We stay humble, we devour, put in the work,

8424
09:02:41,600 --> 09:02:48,080
put in the hour, and take what's ours. Wait, do they do a price increase again?

8425
09:02:48,080 --> 09:02:53,280
So, originally the emotes were $10 per emote and I was like,

8426
09:02:53,280 --> 09:02:57,280
fuck me, that's some good quality. And then I come around for batch too

8427
09:02:57,280 --> 09:03:01,120
and it's now $25 per emote and I'm like, right, that's fine

8428
09:03:01,120 --> 09:03:04,800
because, you know, understandable economy's gone in the gutter because I

8429
09:03:04,800 --> 09:03:11,440
want official emote. And then that's fine and all, but then

8430
09:03:11,440 --> 09:03:16,480
we had quite a few issues like they gave.

8431
09:03:17,120 --> 09:03:20,880
It's just kind of silly stuff, like they sent back an emote they already made of

8432
09:03:20,880 --> 09:03:24,720
Emi, they randomly just made her an emote we never asked for,

8433
09:03:24,720 --> 09:03:29,520
but she actually already had that emote. So it was like, bro, if they drew the

8434
09:03:29,520 --> 09:03:32,800
wrong emote, can you at least draw one that she doesn't have? That would be great.

8435
09:03:32,800 --> 09:03:36,960
Like, because we could have got a free emote XZ.

8436
09:03:40,960 --> 09:03:43,440
Azura has the best laugh, Stroni has the best accent,

8437
09:03:43,440 --> 09:03:46,000
Mersi has the best laugh, Shibi has the best means,

8438
09:03:46,000 --> 09:03:50,320
AC has the best music, and Emi has the best comp option.

8439
09:03:50,320 --> 09:04:00,560
Yeah, her Azura is kind of... But anyway, I'm going to order their third batch now.

8440
09:04:00,720 --> 09:04:07,520
And just take it from there, because obviously unless the girls like have a

8441
09:04:07,520 --> 09:04:11,680
massive event that would increase their emote slots

8442
09:04:11,680 --> 09:04:16,880
significantly, I don't really think there's going to be too many new emotes

8443
09:04:16,880 --> 09:04:21,520
after this third batch. You know, unless like one of the...

8444
09:04:21,520 --> 09:04:27,680
I don't know, if an oiler really comes along then that's a bit different.

8445
09:04:27,680 --> 09:04:30,960
Are you still streaming? I worked a full shift, plus a bit of overtime.

8446
09:04:30,960 --> 09:04:34,240
Do you get paid extra for the overtime at least?

8447
09:04:34,240 --> 09:04:39,440
Remember to hydrate and enjoy your 30-minute post-work shit.

8448
09:04:39,440 --> 09:04:43,600
I'm so fucking happy we discussed that.

8449
09:04:48,640 --> 09:04:54,800
I done goofed, everyone point and laugh. I don't know much about this stuff,

8450
09:04:54,800 --> 09:04:57,680
but 10 bucks is the normal price for an emote.

8451
09:04:57,680 --> 09:05:02,880
It kind of goes a bit higher than that.

8452
09:05:02,880 --> 09:05:07,440
It's a bit different. Like one artist was like 50 per emote and I'm like

8453
09:05:07,440 --> 09:05:11,200
steady on. Let's not be around this.

8454
09:05:11,200 --> 09:05:15,600
We are now in the nine hour mark. Okay.

8455
09:05:16,400 --> 09:05:25,040
And the E. Oh, was the E a mistake? That's even funnier.

8456
09:05:25,040 --> 09:05:30,880
Sorry, that's the one brand for a zero. The E was a mistake.

8457
09:05:30,880 --> 09:05:35,760
The E was a mistake. Increase by 150, it turns out the two dollar

8458
09:05:35,760 --> 09:05:38,880
two-year emote being the gift is here with a secret genius.

8459
09:05:38,880 --> 09:05:43,520
You get 2.5 times as many gifted per dollar compared to the normal five

8460
09:05:43,520 --> 09:05:47,680
but one more slot.

8461
09:05:47,680 --> 09:05:52,160
Yeah, yeah, I completely planned that out.

8462
09:05:52,160 --> 09:05:58,080
Yeah, thought it through. Got the team to approve that.

8463
09:05:58,080 --> 09:06:01,840
Yep, that was completely planned and thank you everyone who has ever gifted

8464
09:06:01,840 --> 09:06:05,440
memberships to myself or any other girl.

8465
09:06:06,080 --> 09:06:12,240
I did not plan it like that. Technically we just passed the nine hour mark.

8466
09:06:14,240 --> 09:06:18,240
I'm trying to head truly.

8467
09:06:25,680 --> 09:06:29,680
Hydration check with water darlin. Oh, shit, fuck.

8468
09:06:29,680 --> 09:06:32,960
Okay, iPur, thank you for the 10 gifted memberships. Holy shit.

8469
09:06:32,960 --> 09:06:36,640
And congrats to those who cut it with your face. I can't really do the high

8470
09:06:36,640 --> 09:06:39,520
pitch right now because my voice is getting very strange.

8471
09:06:39,520 --> 09:06:45,760
What do you mean talking non-stop for nine hours is bad for your vocal cords?

8472
09:06:45,760 --> 09:06:49,920
What are you talking about? I'm serious.

8473
09:06:51,920 --> 09:06:57,520
Congrats to those who cut it and thank you iPur for

8474
09:07:00,000 --> 09:07:05,760
the gifted memberships. I appreciate it. I'm sure the girls all

8475
09:07:05,760 --> 09:07:10,480
appreciate it equally. Anyone who's ever gifted

8476
09:07:10,480 --> 09:07:15,360
has been a fantastic help and especially for those who are looking to move

8477
09:07:15,360 --> 09:07:21,040
out, Kohai and Azura I think are like if they could move out right now

8478
09:07:21,040 --> 09:07:28,480
their content creation would just like go in an upwards motion.

8479
09:07:28,480 --> 09:07:31,920
Still great. You're actually just so good at dodging. You're literally neon from

8480
09:07:32,000 --> 09:07:35,760
the matrix. I'm sorry but you are.

8481
09:07:35,760 --> 09:07:41,760
I love mummy yapping, yeah. A D1 yapper? What's a D1?

8482
09:07:41,760 --> 09:07:45,920
I'm getting nervous. What's a D1?

8483
09:07:46,080 --> 09:07:51,600
What's a D? I was not ready for Unleashed Mercy. She got you gifts.

8484
09:07:52,720 --> 09:07:58,640
I can't believe that the corruption arc is real. Division one, day one.

8485
09:07:59,120 --> 09:08:04,720
Oh my god, is that the hit game? Was it Tom Clark's Division One or something?

8486
09:08:04,720 --> 09:08:09,280
What was that game called? I think I'm a brains. My brain's short circuiting.

8487
09:08:09,280 --> 09:08:14,720
Oh no, this can't be. You can't believe it. Nine hours?

8488
09:08:14,720 --> 09:08:21,520
Thanks for the gift. Division one is the highest rank of college sports in

8489
09:08:21,520 --> 09:08:24,960
USA. Okay, I didn't even know you had

8490
09:08:25,040 --> 09:08:29,440
fucking divisions. You got like a fucking diamond rank as well.

8491
09:08:29,440 --> 09:08:35,280
Masters. Top 500 rank. Oh, big Tom Clancy.

8492
09:08:35,280 --> 09:08:40,720
Tom Clark. Look, look. Clark is a really good shoe shop, okay?

8493
09:08:40,720 --> 09:08:44,720
If you just want nice school shoes, just go there.

8494
09:08:45,200 --> 09:08:48,720
I have a really sad story about a shoe shop, that story.

8495
09:08:48,720 --> 09:08:51,200
I'll tell it another time. I didn't want to depress you though.

8496
09:08:51,200 --> 09:08:56,080
Did anyone want to bomb you there? Oh, is that A.C.?

8497
09:08:56,080 --> 09:08:59,040
Is that A.C.?

8498
09:08:59,680 --> 09:09:03,040
Is this supposed to be A.C. Call?

8499
09:09:03,200 --> 09:09:07,360
Is this supposed to be mommy A.C.? Truly.

8500
09:09:08,240 --> 09:09:12,880
I might have been prepared to go and it's just an anime girl that looks like A.C.

8501
09:09:12,880 --> 09:09:15,840
In Azura Stream.

8502
09:09:16,800 --> 09:09:20,880
You check if your count is a brand account.

8503
09:09:20,880 --> 09:09:25,360
Division one means you are at the top of the game at yapping.

8504
09:09:25,360 --> 09:09:31,760
How dare you. Professionally yapping you.

8505
09:09:32,240 --> 09:09:35,760
It's not a brand account check to be for you. You're just really good at dodging

8506
09:09:35,760 --> 09:09:39,040
then, I'm sorry, but you might as well sign up to play dodgeball because

8507
09:09:39,040 --> 09:09:42,480
you'd already be ranked one. Easy peasy one, squeezy.

8508
09:09:42,720 --> 09:09:48,000
The classic game, Tom Clark Splinter Cell. Stop, okay.

8509
09:09:48,000 --> 09:09:51,840
What was that game that was shooting with portals?

8510
09:09:51,840 --> 09:09:54,880
It was like a shooter game and you could make portals.

8511
09:09:54,880 --> 09:10:00,480
Split, portal? Split, portal? Split, something?

8512
09:10:00,480 --> 09:10:06,720
Split. It had a good premise. No, no, no. It's split gate. That's it. Split gate.

8513
09:10:06,720 --> 09:10:10,720
I had like you could kill people in it. Not, not portal. Split gate. Sorry, I was

8514
09:10:10,720 --> 09:10:14,640
talking about split gate. It was called with portals basically.

8515
09:10:14,640 --> 09:10:18,000
I wonder, did that game succeed? Is it still

8516
09:10:18,000 --> 09:10:21,680
successful? Is it still good? I played it when it

8517
09:10:21,680 --> 09:10:26,000
came out, but unfortunately because of the debuff of being a wham and I couldn't

8518
09:10:26,000 --> 09:10:29,440
wrap my head around the portals properly so I used to just focus on shooting

8519
09:10:29,440 --> 09:10:31,920
only and I was like, I might as well just sit and play college at you.

8520
09:10:31,920 --> 09:10:35,600
That's right because I'm not doing it properly. It didn't pop off like it needed

8521
09:10:35,600 --> 09:10:39,680
to. Oh that's such a shame. They're making a second one though.

8522
09:10:40,640 --> 09:10:46,800
I just feel like it's so much like, you need to use your mind so much.

8523
09:10:50,400 --> 09:10:53,760
But they're redoing it's art style curious. It was more like Halo's though.

8524
09:10:53,760 --> 09:10:56,320
Like 18.

8525
09:10:57,120 --> 09:11:01,200
There's uh Chance, I absolutely rune strong in a match. It's like great without

8526
09:11:01,200 --> 09:11:05,200
none. Um, what was...

8527
09:11:05,840 --> 09:11:10,160
My online handles are different everywhere for safety and I never

8528
09:11:10,160 --> 09:11:12,480
identify myself if I'm playing a game.

8529
09:11:12,480 --> 09:11:18,880
Um, like, I don't, it's just too much. Like my names are

8530
09:11:18,880 --> 09:11:23,120
scarred up. So many like different online game names.

8531
09:11:23,120 --> 09:11:27,120
And you would never know what it's mean, so...

8532
09:11:27,120 --> 09:11:34,640
Yeah, right. But there is a possibility that uh you got teabagged by me.

8533
09:11:34,640 --> 09:11:40,720
So yeah. I was good at the kills. I kept getting shot in the back at unexpected

8534
09:11:40,720 --> 09:11:44,960
portals and my brain just couldn't process the

8535
09:11:44,960 --> 09:11:48,320
sounds of the game either. Like I was really struggling to adjust.

8536
09:11:48,320 --> 09:11:53,680
Like I think I gave Valorant like a couple of days

8537
09:11:53,680 --> 09:11:57,680
and I really struggled to get used to the like the surround sound

8538
09:11:57,680 --> 09:12:02,560
of like here in an anime to the left. Like footsteps are so loud in Valorant.

8539
09:12:02,560 --> 09:12:07,360
Totally not strong as 69x0x0. When did you play Dead by Daylight?

8540
09:12:07,360 --> 09:12:12,240
Oh, I am an, I am a back in my day in Dead by Daylight.

8541
09:12:12,240 --> 09:12:16,560
Uh, you know, slugging was a thing. I don't think it's a thing anymore.

8542
09:12:16,560 --> 09:12:21,120
Um, you wouldn't have uh known

8543
09:12:21,120 --> 09:12:25,760
me but I, I, you play, I did play Overwatch. I don't play it anymore,

8544
09:12:25,760 --> 09:12:29,440
unfortunately. Tons of years in it. Apparently they're

8545
09:12:29,440 --> 09:12:34,880
bringing back 66 in Overwatch. I'm not sure how much I believe it.

8546
09:12:34,880 --> 09:12:38,160
I'll believe it when I see it.

8547
09:12:39,680 --> 09:12:46,000
Right pointing finger, left pointing finger. The jettier, the better.

8548
09:12:46,000 --> 09:12:49,120
Scottish say follow politics, let's go. I don't like Valorant if I want to play

8549
09:12:49,120 --> 09:12:55,280
Valorant and go for CS though. Wait, no! Valorant's not like CS though.

8550
09:12:55,280 --> 09:12:58,560
Slugging still happens. Overwatch killed it. They said they're in testing because

8551
09:12:58,560 --> 09:13:02,000
they're shifting the meta around or something.

8552
09:13:02,000 --> 09:13:06,000
Ugh, I don't know what's going on. Overwatch, my beloved. I don't know

8553
09:13:06,000 --> 09:13:09,440
what happened to you. Apparently there's a new healer though and I

8554
09:13:09,440 --> 09:13:12,240
have to admit I do like playing healers in video games.

8555
09:13:12,240 --> 09:13:15,600
I don't care if it's stereotypical. Strongly you're such a girl playing the

8556
09:13:15,600 --> 09:13:18,000
healer. I like playing the healer. I like the stress of

8557
09:13:18,000 --> 09:13:21,280
keeping everyone alive. Sorry, I do. I like that kind of stress of

8558
09:13:21,280 --> 09:13:24,800
being like, haha, I made you feel better in the game.

8559
09:13:24,800 --> 09:13:29,360
Okay, I don't care and I have to admit, the new character Juno has me

8560
09:13:29,360 --> 09:13:33,760
interested in potentially installing the game again.

8561
09:13:33,760 --> 09:13:38,720
But I wouldn't subject you guys to it on stream so don't worry before you're

8562
09:13:38,720 --> 09:13:42,560
like, hey, Overwatch stream, I will not subject you to it.

8563
09:13:42,560 --> 09:13:47,120
But I don't know if Juno's unlocked or if it's behind the battle pass because

8564
09:13:47,120 --> 09:13:50,400
I heard there was a big controversy

8565
09:13:50,480 --> 09:13:52,480
of like

8566
09:13:56,400 --> 09:13:59,680
she censored that, right?

8567
09:14:00,960 --> 09:14:06,320
I just saw that in the corner of my eye. She censored the fuck out of my eye.

8568
09:14:06,320 --> 09:14:11,440
They removed the healers at the battle pass in a while.

8569
09:14:12,160 --> 09:14:17,200
I only play tank. I like the mental damage.

8570
09:14:17,200 --> 09:14:23,760
Okay, I might unironically give Juno a shot. Apparently she's like an

8571
09:14:23,760 --> 09:14:27,280
all healer. She's like Ana where she can heal and

8572
09:14:27,280 --> 09:14:32,240
damage. You don't have to go between it. I'm not going to lie. Juno might drag me

8573
09:14:32,240 --> 09:14:35,840
in again a little bit, but you won't know.

8574
09:14:35,840 --> 09:14:39,920
And before I develop a new voiceline thanks to Overwatch too.

8575
09:14:39,920 --> 09:14:43,120
I better not. No more voiceline.

8576
09:14:43,840 --> 09:14:47,760
That was manual. I played a bit of Juno.

8577
09:14:47,760 --> 09:14:50,880
She's actually pretty fun.

8578
09:14:53,440 --> 09:14:57,200
E is a speed boost like Lucio and they're always an AOE that heals

8579
09:14:57,200 --> 09:15:02,400
increases or damage. Oh, I like that.

8580
09:15:02,640 --> 09:15:07,120
Oh, it's almost like an offensive healer. Like let's get in there, boys.

8581
09:15:07,120 --> 09:15:10,560
I like that. I like that. Stop it. You're gonna pull me in.

8582
09:15:10,560 --> 09:15:15,280
Don't pull me in at Overwatch again. I abandoned that baby when Papa Jeff

8583
09:15:15,280 --> 09:15:18,480
left. May he rip and piss even though he's still

8584
09:15:18,480 --> 09:15:22,720
alive and doing his thing, but may he rip?

8585
09:15:25,360 --> 09:15:29,200
Is Brig any good these days? I used to main him.

8586
09:15:29,200 --> 09:15:34,320
I'm afraid. It's a choke on my lord. Excuse me. Hold on a minute.

8587
09:15:34,320 --> 09:15:38,480
No, don't get nauseated. No, no, no, refling. Don't be sick because we're talking

8588
09:15:38,560 --> 09:15:43,280
about Overwatch too. No, don't be sick, don't be sick.

8589
09:15:46,080 --> 09:15:50,640
Papa Jeff Kaplan. Yeah, Jeff Kaplan left the development team when he learned

8590
09:15:50,640 --> 09:15:55,120
what was happening to Overwatch too.

8591
09:15:55,680 --> 09:16:02,320
As I'm fucking dying now apparently. I might need to pee. My bladder is getting

8592
09:16:02,320 --> 09:16:05,280
a bit full. I'm gonna be honest. I'm pretty full of liquid.

8593
09:16:05,280 --> 09:16:10,000
I don't know about you, but my bladder's pretty full of liquid right now.

8594
09:16:10,000 --> 09:16:12,240
A bit of liquid.

8595
09:16:17,440 --> 09:16:21,600
Are we allowed to do a very quick pee break? I'll keep the vod of

8596
09:16:21,600 --> 09:16:28,560
Azura going though. I won't pause it. Oh my god! Who's crying like that?

8597
09:16:28,560 --> 09:16:34,400
I just look over on the Azura Vod and it's like actually greeting out the wazoo.

8598
09:16:36,160 --> 09:16:39,520
Who's greeting like that? My little strawberry face.

8599
09:16:41,360 --> 09:16:42,400
Her baby.

8600
09:16:45,440 --> 09:16:49,280
I was a Moira main when she released. She was great. I love Moira too.

8601
09:16:49,280 --> 09:16:52,800
This is Emmy and her insurance fees. No, I don't know how she does it.

8602
09:16:52,800 --> 09:16:58,080
Like if I need to pee, I'm gonna go. Would you guys like to go with me?

8603
09:16:58,800 --> 09:17:06,480
Mommy is making a pee. Right, you know the rules. I will sit down and then you pee in

8604
09:17:06,480 --> 09:17:10,800
between my legs, okay? So then we both pee at the same time and our streams connect

8605
09:17:10,800 --> 09:17:14,320
and then I have taken a bit of your soul by doing this action because you know

8606
09:17:14,320 --> 09:17:18,560
there's no other crazier girl that would ever do something like that.

8607
09:17:19,120 --> 09:17:21,920
Maybe some of the Veiler girls might do something like that with you.

8608
09:17:21,920 --> 09:17:25,600
But in general, as a rule of thumb, most girls will not do that and I will steal

8609
09:17:25,600 --> 09:17:28,160
a part of your soul and you'll be forever mine briefly.

8610
09:17:30,320 --> 09:17:33,280
Okay, now that I'm aware how much we need to pee, I'm actually gonna go pee because I

8611
09:17:33,280 --> 09:17:36,480
really need to pee. I'll be right back, okay? The toilet's just there.

8612
09:17:36,480 --> 09:17:40,080
That's why I mute when I'm like, let's hear you pee. No.

8613
09:17:40,960 --> 09:17:42,560
Now go pee and stretch your legs.

8614
09:19:26,080 --> 09:19:47,360
You know, even after how much liquid I've drank, it's still not clear.

8615
09:19:48,400 --> 09:19:52,720
I think I'm permanently just always gonna have like yellow

8616
09:19:52,960 --> 09:20:00,400
pee. I must confess, it's killing me.

8617
09:20:04,400 --> 09:20:06,560
I'm done, but mommy's in back, get broke.

8618
09:20:09,520 --> 09:20:14,160
That's just, uh, yous are okay. I was only going for a little bit.

8619
09:20:14,720 --> 09:20:20,080
Did I wash my hands? The answer is no. Before anyone asks, you know.

8620
09:20:20,080 --> 09:20:25,040
If it's clear, you're over hydrating it? Okay. I mean, it wasn't neon, so I'll get,

8621
09:20:25,040 --> 09:20:26,960
I'll give myself credit. It wasn't neon.

8622
09:20:37,760 --> 09:20:40,640
What about 11,000? Right, as long as we're under like,

8623
09:20:41,680 --> 09:20:48,080
I'd say if we do get to 6,000 wines left, that's a three hour stream, which is kind

8624
09:20:48,080 --> 09:20:54,720
of perfect to wrap it up. Wrap it up, wrap it up. This stream should look pretty clear,

8625
09:20:54,720 --> 09:21:01,600
but when you look in the toilet after it should be a bit yellow. What? Oh, right, sorry. Okay,

8626
09:21:01,600 --> 09:21:11,440
I'm gonna see you. Okay, we're all good. Kind of like your hands clean for you.

8627
09:21:12,000 --> 09:21:31,200
I don't know, as long as you don't touch like any of the yellow snow or like the toilet paper

8628
09:21:31,200 --> 09:21:36,400
or anything like that. Wait, no, you touch the toilet paper to stop you from, the barrier.

8629
09:21:37,200 --> 09:21:41,360
As long as you don't leak like that, then you really have to wash your hands? I don't know.

8630
09:21:41,680 --> 09:21:49,040
Who knows? I'm not a germ expert, okay? I'm just a germ because I'm disgusting. Thank you,

8631
09:21:49,040 --> 09:21:54,720
I'll be here. That's not even a sentence. I think I'm starting to slowly get slightly delirious.

8632
09:21:54,720 --> 09:21:59,360
Gonna be honest, like I'm getting slightly delirious. I'm trying to drink some more water.

8633
09:21:59,920 --> 09:22:00,400
Yee-hee.

8634
09:22:03,600 --> 09:22:11,120
Okay, last few minutes you're all done. Aw, look at how many she managed to do, that's fantastic.

8635
09:22:15,600 --> 09:22:19,200
She's getting steam in? I think she did box shot relate after this actually.

8636
09:22:20,000 --> 09:22:27,840
Okay, box shot relate. Yay, predicted.

8637
09:22:29,840 --> 09:22:33,120
Been gone, been gone for nine hours, only slightly delirious, yeah.

8638
09:22:34,880 --> 09:22:39,600
I'm gonna get a big nap. This is definitely like, this is when I get into bed

8639
09:22:41,280 --> 09:22:46,640
and start falling asleep, so we're doing all right. We're doing all right.

8640
09:22:46,640 --> 09:22:50,480
We're doing all right, okay. You don't have to worry about me, so we're doing okay.

8641
09:22:56,960 --> 09:23:00,960
Oh, mercy, had the game crashed in here. That was a hard one.

8642
09:23:00,960 --> 09:23:05,040
Her game crashed and I was like, oh, okay.

8643
09:23:07,520 --> 09:23:12,240
Monk, Monk, Monk, Monk. We're actually in sleep.

8644
09:23:12,640 --> 09:23:21,040
Been gone for nine hours, only slightly delirious, she's getting E.P.

8645
09:23:22,320 --> 09:23:28,320
I'm gonna do marshmallows after the zero stream ends, so I'm starting to perish.

8646
09:23:30,160 --> 09:23:33,840
I'm starting to perish. I'm gonna make a,

8647
09:23:36,480 --> 09:23:37,920
I'm gonna make a, I'm gonna make a,

8648
09:23:38,320 --> 09:23:44,080
I'm trying to, like, drink to keep myself awake.

8649
09:23:45,680 --> 09:23:49,280
Amy fell asleep, now she's awake.

8650
09:23:51,760 --> 09:23:57,360
Probably could go to bed, I'll wait. I'll round it out and go at the top of the hour.

8651
09:24:00,080 --> 09:24:03,440
No, I'm gonna try to keep going because if I don't do it now,

8652
09:24:04,240 --> 09:24:06,560
the next stream is gonna take so much longer.

8653
09:24:07,440 --> 09:24:13,680
Wipes off face, your seat is ready, man. Stop it, Gira lurking outside on the ring cam, Bob.

8654
09:24:14,800 --> 09:24:17,760
It's that profile picture kills me every time I see it.

8655
09:24:18,720 --> 09:24:22,720
I just really like, oh, you hear like ding, ding, ding, and then oh, you hear it's

8656
09:24:23,520 --> 09:24:28,560
at your door and nothing else. Like, that's every time my brain plays that when I see your profile picture.

8657
09:24:29,520 --> 09:24:32,000
Thank you for like this to the chat.

8658
09:24:32,000 --> 09:24:35,920
It's literally Gira's ult. I hope you're doing okay then, darling.

8659
09:24:38,320 --> 09:24:41,200
Um, that was pretty smooth though.

8660
09:24:42,480 --> 09:24:47,760
But I'm warning you all now, I'm getting E.P., okay? And when I'm E.P., I'm not as hyper,

8661
09:24:47,760 --> 09:24:55,120
you've been warned. So don't expect hyper mumme. Mumme's getting tired, mumme's needing a lie down.

8662
09:24:59,520 --> 09:25:05,920
She's in E.P., E.P., but I can do it, okay? I can grind. If I get to like,

8663
09:25:07,680 --> 09:25:13,840
if I make it to four o'clock, what, how four, when's four o'clock? Did you know

8664
09:25:13,840 --> 09:25:18,400
o'clock means of the clock? I just thought you should know that. So when I say four o'clock,

8665
09:25:18,400 --> 09:25:25,520
I'm actually saying four of the clock. I just thought you should know because that's how it works

8666
09:25:25,520 --> 09:25:33,920
and dying. Mumme's gonna be a cuttlefish in bed with a recent stop. I cannot wait to get a freaking

8667
09:25:33,920 --> 09:25:39,840
mask off, like plushie. I'm gonna do so many things to that plushie. I'm gonna hump it. Sorry,

8668
09:25:39,840 --> 09:25:46,080
I shouldn't say that already. Oh, my inhibition. Oh, I'm not supposed to say that stuff.

8669
09:25:48,000 --> 09:25:55,120
Sorry. I'm gonna do ASMR with you, okay? I'm doing ASMR with you. Then I'm doing

8670
09:25:56,000 --> 09:26:04,480
what else am I doing with you? I'm gonna, I'm gonna put my feet on you. I'm gonna sit on you

8671
09:26:04,480 --> 09:26:16,000
with my butt and take photos. I'm gonna stick a tentacle on you and like edit it and be like,

8672
09:26:16,000 --> 09:26:22,320
damn, Reef was ready to go. Yeah, if Mumme goes to bed, I can go to bed, so it'd be fine

8673
09:26:22,320 --> 09:26:29,200
if you don't go to school all of a sudden. I just, I need, if I get it to 6,000 winds are left, I know

8674
09:26:29,200 --> 09:26:34,560
in my head that's three hours and I know for a fact I can yank for three hours unprompted.

8675
09:26:36,560 --> 09:26:44,720
So it's not gonna be a problem, but if I like chicken out now, there's a living so that's five

8676
09:26:44,720 --> 09:26:51,840
more hours and that's not terrible because I'm like, that's not really a bad for an endurance

8677
09:26:51,840 --> 09:26:56,800
stream type thing, but I've not got another five more hours, five more hours.

8678
09:27:01,120 --> 09:27:02,880
What about 8,000 for four hours?

8679
09:27:05,040 --> 09:27:09,280
Please don't leave me alone with the cats. No, Gimli Vigo won't go for you.

8680
09:27:09,280 --> 09:27:14,240
Do we need to keep that Reef limb plushie in some kind of predictive custody? No, it's mine.

8681
09:27:14,880 --> 09:27:23,360
It's mine, Reef. I get to do what I want them and he's gonna like it, isn't he?

8682
09:27:27,200 --> 09:27:28,160
He's gonna like it.

8683
09:27:33,600 --> 09:27:40,960
I guess he's, I'm straight, he's moving, but I'm very excited to get it and then I can

8684
09:27:40,960 --> 09:27:47,120
start my mascot ASMR series because I'm gonna get all the girls and I'm excited to do that and then

8685
09:27:47,120 --> 09:27:53,680
I could start doing it for other VTubers as well if they'd like to send me their mascot possibly.

8686
09:27:57,440 --> 09:28:03,920
Or maybe their plushie of their character, but I think it's rather cute to do it for the mascot

8687
09:28:03,920 --> 09:28:10,800
instead because it's like oh your name's this and you know your oh she started streaming and then

8688
09:28:10,800 --> 09:28:15,760
most notable streams were this and facts were this and like it's all positive. Every fling she can

8689
09:28:15,760 --> 09:28:22,160
grape for you lives. We need to keep strong and protective custody of it. No, she keeps the plushie

8690
09:28:22,160 --> 09:28:29,600
in a jar. No, what are we agreeing to? A lot of things. All at once. Right, we're just about to go

8691
09:28:29,680 --> 09:28:38,400
under 11,000. Oh my god, we're doing it. We are getting 99 and we're not really doing it on time,

8692
09:28:38,400 --> 09:28:43,280
but that's okay because we did the Nigerians and I had loads of fun doing the missions with you guys,

8693
09:28:43,280 --> 09:28:48,960
the quests in the first one. I think we will revisit RuneScape, but we'll 100% do questing

8694
09:28:50,880 --> 09:28:54,400
and I'll plan out the quests far in advance so everyone knows what's coming up.

8695
09:28:54,400 --> 09:28:59,040
Um, just, yeah, no.

8696
09:29:05,200 --> 09:29:10,880
What should we do? Is there a drawing time? Is she, is she post-yapping now? Or is she still going for it?

8697
09:29:18,000 --> 09:29:22,400
Yeah, mascot first so the girls get what they want, then the girls plushie next question.

8698
09:29:22,480 --> 09:29:24,960
Will any of the plushies be machine washable?

8699
09:29:27,600 --> 09:29:34,480
I saw someone cut open and put, uh, another thing before and I was like,

8700
09:29:35,200 --> 09:29:39,680
look, it's really degenerate but it's kind of horrible. I mean, he kind of cooked for that one

8701
09:29:39,680 --> 09:29:45,600
after me. Hi, Stony, how are you? I'm good, Rieflin, how are you? How big will the plushie

8702
09:29:45,600 --> 09:29:56,560
will be for this size, head size, torso? Um, uh, you put your hand straight. However long your hand

8703
09:29:56,560 --> 09:30:03,280
is is like kind of how big the plushie will be. Do you remember when I did the hand cam,

8704
09:30:03,280 --> 09:30:09,280
like, American Eatin' Sweets and I touched the plushies of Strawberry and Cinder? Yeah.

8705
09:30:10,160 --> 09:30:15,360
Well, why would they need to be machine? Now, why would they need to be a little silly like that?

8706
09:30:26,160 --> 09:30:29,520
Are there any other skills that require you to just sit in one place and click?

8707
09:30:30,720 --> 09:30:37,120
Eh! Wait, what's that in reference to? Cut is open. No, I wouldn't do it to you. I'm sticking

8708
09:30:37,120 --> 09:30:44,400
the tentacle on you. It's the girls, girls as a plushie, you'd cut open and stick an attachment

8709
09:30:44,400 --> 09:30:54,560
inside. Eight inches? I mean, yeah. Your hand eight inches long, what the fuck?

8710
09:30:55,280 --> 09:31:10,880
So I love the way Zero talks. I need more of that ASMR. Give me the goods. You know what we're

8711
09:31:10,880 --> 09:31:21,040
both here for. The mascots are getting prosthetic. Magic if you spam jewelry enchantment.

8712
09:31:22,000 --> 09:31:25,920
What we're doing, what, we're already picking the next one we're doing?

8713
09:31:27,280 --> 09:31:32,320
For a level and to get 99 and before we end up doing like a 99 account just for the hell of it.

8714
09:31:44,240 --> 09:31:46,320
You know what else is eight inches? Three of these.

8715
09:31:46,400 --> 09:31:51,920
Mm-hmm. Anyone know what that would be? What's eight divided by three?

8716
09:31:54,080 --> 09:32:03,760
Two point something. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, Mr. Krabs. I'm guessing Zero's the first one to get harassed

8717
09:32:03,760 --> 09:32:08,400
by Strony and then sent to HR. I don't know who the first girl harassed was.

8718
09:32:09,280 --> 09:32:18,320
I suppose technically it was Zero because during debut I went sexy. Oh no, I went

8719
09:32:19,200 --> 09:32:28,720
during debut but inside it was sexy, sexy. Reverse, thank you for letting me pop your cherry

8720
09:32:29,680 --> 09:32:34,320
for your super chat. It's mine now, yoink. Thank you.

8721
09:32:36,080 --> 09:32:40,560
Two point six six. Since we we flings are basically ahead with tentacles and you're

8722
09:32:40,560 --> 09:32:48,080
adding another tentacle to our heads, what are you trying to imply? No, it's four. It'll make

8723
09:32:48,080 --> 09:32:53,840
sense when I show the picture of what I have planned for you, okay? It's supposed to be like

8724
09:32:54,720 --> 09:33:05,360
your thing, okay? It'll make sense when I show it but it doesn't make any sense

8725
09:33:05,360 --> 09:33:11,680
verbally explaining what the photo is. Off collab with you guys is going to be wild stuff.

8726
09:33:12,400 --> 09:33:17,120
As I said before, all the girls were like down to come to Australia just because of me being an

8727
09:33:17,120 --> 09:33:24,000
anxious little mop bag that can't even eat with us. I'm like bro, are you trying to make me cry the

8728
09:33:24,000 --> 09:33:29,200
fuck? Like we actually only, I mean technically pre-debut but we didn't know each other that

8729
09:33:29,200 --> 09:33:34,800
well because we couldn't really, but it wasn't until after like we debuted and that we could get a

8730
09:33:34,800 --> 09:33:42,320
better feel of each other. Whoa, hold on a minute. I get Copa Fila, it's going to be the name of a

8731
09:33:42,320 --> 09:33:48,080
gen two. Hold on, just look down. Copa Fila, sorry. That's not even funny, shut up. Stop it. Stop it.

8732
09:33:49,920 --> 09:33:57,840
I mean trust the sign, it's you. I like to live. But yeah, all of them were like down to come to

8733
09:33:57,840 --> 09:34:06,160
Australia and I was like, oh I'd probably rent like an Airbnb for like however long they're staying

8734
09:34:06,160 --> 09:34:11,120
in higher computers and stuff and oh maybe not higher actually, I don't want to get sensitive

8735
09:34:12,080 --> 09:34:18,880
information. Is that kind of stuff? Yeah, yeah. The girls fighting over who wants to stream

8736
09:34:19,760 --> 09:34:21,520
because we can't do all the whole thing.

8737
09:34:24,800 --> 09:34:29,280
Personally I'd prefer a plushie of you over the refland but I would buy both. Oh we have to pick

8738
09:34:29,280 --> 09:34:34,960
one first. I thought mascots was nicer. Now I don't know if that's selfish of me to say that

8739
09:34:35,040 --> 09:34:40,960
mascots is more fun because obviously I want to do that series and I want a physical

8740
09:34:41,840 --> 09:34:46,720
thing of you that I can interact with when I make content. Like I'll be you know doing like

8741
09:34:46,720 --> 09:34:52,560
standing on you stuff, sitting on you, pinning you against the wall type stuff. Like I want that,

8742
09:34:52,560 --> 09:34:59,120
I want physical stuff that I can do with you. Ace and Martin would work since it would be one

8743
09:34:59,680 --> 09:35:03,520
at a time anyway. We all licking the same microphone.

8744
09:35:08,800 --> 09:35:09,440
Is she okay?

8745
09:35:11,840 --> 09:35:17,440
Oh did someone drop her? Fat. Super chat. Chad. Real.

8746
09:35:17,760 --> 09:35:19,760
Real.

8747
09:35:26,640 --> 09:35:30,000
I really understand why you want refland first. I still can't wait to color your

8748
09:35:30,000 --> 09:35:33,200
plushie. Thank you for your patience.

8749
09:35:37,520 --> 09:35:40,480
I think having plushies of girls would be cute to imagine as a bacon.

8750
09:35:41,440 --> 09:35:46,720
Yeah you need an airbnb, can't fit five more girls on your- stop! That's funny.

8751
09:35:48,800 --> 09:35:50,480
I would need to travel.

8752
09:35:50,480 --> 09:36:00,480
Oh.

8753
09:36:03,520 --> 09:36:05,760
Oh I'm so fucking cute. What the fuck?

8754
09:36:07,280 --> 09:36:09,760
You know you know you picked them good with me at the level.

8755
09:36:12,080 --> 09:36:16,560
I like the idea of a plushie view so I can have it sitting on my desk. I just stare at you and I'm

8756
09:36:16,560 --> 09:36:27,440
offline. You already know I'm listening in via the plushie. For the plushies there needs to be a

8757
09:36:27,440 --> 09:36:33,360
down payment for the production cost. It's not like one can be produced at a time. It's like all

8758
09:36:33,360 --> 09:36:40,240
the materials get ordered after the prototype's made and then a batch is made. 75 crafting I can

8759
09:36:40,240 --> 09:36:42,240
finally get my glory.

8760
09:36:48,240 --> 09:36:52,240
Uh starting plushie with Neil Lemonade dispensing!

8761
09:36:52,240 --> 09:36:54,480
The plushie even has a hole in the bottom to hide in the mic.

8762
09:36:55,760 --> 09:36:58,880
Mercy showed you how to wiretap the plushies didn't she?

8763
09:36:58,880 --> 09:37:00,640
Oh I like that.

8764
09:37:01,200 --> 09:37:04,320
Right in that A is my port for Mercy right now.

8765
09:37:06,320 --> 09:37:12,160
I'm stroney fumo with empty eyes staring into my soul. The plushies have cameras so Stroney can

8766
09:37:12,160 --> 09:37:18,160
watch us. They're dark in your- or wonk in your willy honestly.

8767
09:37:20,320 --> 09:37:27,040
Honestly? Literally when the reeflings don't send enough tributes, fine. I'll do it myself.

8768
09:37:27,120 --> 09:37:29,200
Releases a plushie line with hidden cameras.

8769
09:37:31,280 --> 09:37:33,280
That's terrible.

8770
09:37:45,200 --> 09:37:47,600
I'd be down. I mean who said that? Hold on a minute.

8771
09:37:47,600 --> 09:37:48,960
Are you squiddin' me right now?

8772
09:37:49,360 --> 09:37:50,960
Wow.

8773
09:38:01,680 --> 09:38:06,960
No! How am I supposed to put that into an A? That's difficult. That's difficult.

8774
09:38:08,080 --> 09:38:13,920
Thank you tiny spain. I'm not sure how I'd manage that. It's so hard to do collabs so

8775
09:38:14,640 --> 09:38:23,680
we all have collabs in August but it is so hard to like have a flow and edit and all that stuff.

8776
09:38:23,680 --> 09:38:27,520
It's a bit of a nightmare. I'm gonna burp I'm so sorry.

8777
09:38:31,200 --> 09:38:34,800
I didn't realize it was gonna be that. I'm gonna like charge that up.

8778
09:38:35,760 --> 09:38:36,240
Um

8779
09:38:38,720 --> 09:38:45,840
But yeah we all got a little club to- oh I got a 10 out of 10. Nice base. Oh a 9 out of 10.

8780
09:38:47,120 --> 09:38:54,320
What was that? I burped it? That one came out deep. I put- I like tilted my head back to do that one.

8781
09:38:54,320 --> 09:38:57,520
I wonder if that's the secret. Oh I got an 11 out of 10.

8782
09:38:57,520 --> 09:39:07,120
Oh a 7 out of 10. 12 out of 10. Oh you need to clip it and ship it. I need to post like a

8783
09:39:07,120 --> 09:39:12,640
just a 60 second short of mean. It's just me burping. But it's all my best burps. Not the weak burps.

8784
09:39:19,280 --> 09:39:26,640
Oh don't. I'll make that one. And on don't. I'll make that. I'm not even kidding. You already

8785
09:39:26,640 --> 09:39:34,480
know I will go on a schizophrenia grant. You already know I will make it stop. Will I make it in

8786
09:39:34,480 --> 09:39:43,920
October? Because there's a missing one in October. Will I do it? Oh it's so good anonymous. What a

8787
09:39:43,920 --> 09:39:50,560
good suggestion. I don't know. I mean you will be logged out in 30 minutes. Make sure you move to

8788
09:39:51,440 --> 09:39:59,840
why? I'm not allowed to unhealthily play your game. How dare you. The anger you should get.

8789
09:40:00,800 --> 09:40:07,040
Actually another thing. I can't extend my voice too much as sore right now.

8790
09:40:08,800 --> 09:40:15,200
Ript your soul at home. 20 pounds your pro state while making you add.

8791
09:40:16,080 --> 09:40:20,880
Don't take a window.

8792
09:40:22,320 --> 09:40:27,200
Stony skits a ranting triggered by the name of a male body part. 10 hours of

8793
09:40:32,880 --> 09:40:38,640
We've done 10 hours have we? That's what I was trying to say. And all it came out was a beatbox.

8794
09:40:45,840 --> 09:40:52,080
You got a big. Let me search you. You got a honey, honey word. Yeah. It's your

8795
09:40:56,880 --> 09:40:59,600
You got a big. Let me search. Yeah.

8796
09:40:59,600 --> 09:41:01,600
Oh

8797
09:41:18,160 --> 09:41:23,360
That was terrible. I know we're reacting to a vote. That was terrible. You should be ashamed.

8798
09:41:24,320 --> 09:41:27,520
Ooh, even I do this.

8799
09:41:31,920 --> 09:41:38,800
We're almost at 10. What kind of beatbox is that? It was the Missy Elliott. You got a big. Let me

8800
09:41:38,800 --> 09:41:45,360
search it. Yeah. I gotta work it. It's your flipping the benign yet. And if you reverse it,

8801
09:41:46,240 --> 09:41:48,080
it says something I can't remember.

8802
09:41:48,800 --> 09:41:56,560
Are we sacred? Wait, she sacrifices bleeding hearts when they don't act. Well, that's hilarious.

8803
09:41:57,120 --> 09:41:59,360
Sorry, I didn't even know she did that. That's hilarious.

8804
09:42:03,040 --> 09:42:08,800
Stony. Oh, no, I missed it. No, I missed a message. I missed a message.

8805
09:42:08,960 --> 09:42:18,960
Wow, you guys are so generous. I'm so thankful for everyone being so nice to the girls. Seriously.

8806
09:42:25,600 --> 09:42:32,560
But that sacrifice is hilarious when they're bleeding hearts. Stony. Well, going on a run

8807
09:42:32,560 --> 09:42:36,560
in the ends of the refund saying that was great mommy, but I said no. Oh,

8808
09:42:37,120 --> 09:42:44,560
oh, just at the end of it. Wait, he said pro state. Oh, sorry, refund.

8809
09:42:46,720 --> 09:42:54,400
Stony karaoke went sadly. Karaoke is going to be delayed. My voice really isn't doing well

8810
09:42:54,400 --> 09:42:58,480
all of the moment. We need to sacrifice bleeding hearts to get showbiz through milk.

8811
09:42:59,280 --> 09:43:01,600
Here's your best people. I can't beat books.

8812
09:43:07,440 --> 09:43:09,120
I can't do it. Oh, no.

8813
09:43:12,080 --> 09:43:12,880
That's all I've got.

8814
09:43:20,880 --> 09:43:25,200
She's just the girl who thinks I am the one.

8815
09:43:26,000 --> 09:43:30,400
But the cat is not in gentle.

8816
09:43:35,200 --> 09:43:41,200
Me when I'm rejected like to design so far. Yeah, you get you shown up in gentle. Yeah,

8817
09:43:41,200 --> 09:43:48,560
here's the design. Give me my secret character I desire.

8818
09:43:48,880 --> 09:43:53,760
Bye bye. I need to go work. Thank you for hanging.

8819
09:43:56,560 --> 09:44:00,480
I would say see you after work. But unfortunately, I'll be off the lane

8820
09:44:01,840 --> 09:44:05,760
because we're actually coming up to the two hour mark.

8821
09:44:10,880 --> 09:44:11,920
What are you giggling at?

8822
09:44:12,640 --> 09:44:24,960
I don't know. I mean, I'm sure there's some sort of correlation with talking for 12 hours straight

8823
09:44:24,960 --> 09:44:28,960
and having a bit of a strange voice. I don't know what the correlation is. I've not figured it out

8824
09:44:28,960 --> 09:44:38,480
yet, but I'm sure there is some sort of let's see you. Sometimes I kind of feel bad for being a

8825
09:44:38,480 --> 09:44:44,160
bald, bleeding heart. Sometimes you can't catch anyone live. It's just how it is. It's just the

8826
09:44:44,160 --> 09:44:52,320
way the world is, honestly. It is what it is. You know, starting it's been 10 hours you get.

8827
09:44:52,320 --> 09:45:00,640
Yeah, we may be able to get 98 before a pop off.

8828
09:45:01,440 --> 09:45:06,000
Surely you just fly. Yes, of course.

8829
09:45:07,760 --> 09:45:14,000
The writer has ruined Giggle for me. Do you just really get flashbacks to Giggle stick without fail?

8830
09:45:19,280 --> 09:45:26,720
Muscle Mummy and Tomboy and Chintu, please. There is actually denied a Muscle Mummy,

8831
09:45:26,720 --> 09:45:31,360
but it's not because she was a Muscle Mummy. It's because there is a design element. I really,

8832
09:45:32,000 --> 09:45:39,440
actually, I can divulge this at this point in time. So there's both male advisors and there's

8833
09:45:39,440 --> 09:45:50,000
both female advisors in like in management. Okay. And if I showed the design to the girls,

8834
09:45:50,960 --> 09:45:57,440
not my gen mates. They've not seen this. If I showed it to the female advisors management,

8835
09:45:59,440 --> 09:46:04,560
they didn't like the design along with me. If I showed the design to the guys,

8836
09:46:05,600 --> 09:46:13,200
they liked it. And it's the first time I've seen a proper difference

8837
09:46:13,600 --> 09:46:21,200
that was very clearly like this is female gaze looking at this design

8838
09:46:21,200 --> 09:46:27,360
versus a male gaze looking at the design. Because I enjoyed the first rendition,

8839
09:46:27,920 --> 09:46:36,400
but then it got off. It got off track as it was developed further. And then I just got

8840
09:46:36,400 --> 09:46:41,840
straight up rejected. But I think we got to the fourth rendition and I was like, no,

8841
09:46:41,840 --> 09:46:49,360
we're just redirecting. We're not having it. If it's interest, no, it is. Of course,

8842
09:46:49,360 --> 09:46:57,600
we guys like it. No, no, no, I'd be very, I don't know if the concept artist is going to try and

8843
09:46:57,600 --> 09:47:05,600
remake her for possibly something else. But as it stands,

8844
09:47:10,160 --> 09:47:15,680
as it stands, she got rejected. There's a second character that got outright rejected. There was

8845
09:47:15,680 --> 09:47:21,520
no alterations. It was just like, no, this isn't at all one track. I'm afraid you're gonna have

8846
09:47:21,520 --> 09:47:28,080
to go back to the building board. Will you release the rejected ideas? I will release them if the

8847
09:47:29,520 --> 09:47:34,400
concept artist has no plans on selling them as adoptables.

8848
09:47:36,800 --> 09:47:42,640
Or doesn't want me to, because I don't want it to be disrespectful. And I mean,

8849
09:47:43,440 --> 09:47:46,640
you know, most of us have worked together before, so it's not really a disrespect thing. It's just

8850
09:47:46,640 --> 09:47:51,600
kind of like, obviously, it might not feel good if your design gets rejected. And it's like, well,

8851
09:47:51,600 --> 09:47:57,680
why are you rejecting it? And it's not like the design's objectively ugly. There's actually one

8852
09:47:57,680 --> 09:48:04,960
aspect in the design that got outright rejected that I really want to see used in another design.

8853
09:48:06,320 --> 09:48:13,280
So I'm not sure if we could show it if and when Gen 2 are confirmed and pop up. I'm not sure.

8854
09:48:14,080 --> 09:48:17,920
Obviously, I'll do my classic exposing the Allure's Gen 2.

8855
09:48:20,480 --> 09:48:23,600
Although the development notes aren't going to be as fun this time, because I never

8856
09:48:24,480 --> 09:48:32,240
got to name and put terrible names on the designs. Basically, you don't own the rights. Oh no,

8857
09:48:32,240 --> 09:48:36,560
I own the rights to it. I own the rights to whatever we've been produced by the concept artist.

8858
09:48:37,920 --> 09:48:42,240
But I'm not an asshole. I'm not going to turn around and be like, I'm going to embarrass you by

8859
09:48:42,240 --> 09:48:47,520
showing your rejected design. If they want to, you know, sell it as an adoptable or whatever,

8860
09:48:47,520 --> 09:48:54,720
that's fine with me. That's not a problem with me. Can't create some formal, so it's tricky.

8861
09:48:56,160 --> 09:49:00,960
I will say I have dropped the forbidden architect, archetype suggestion,

8862
09:49:01,840 --> 09:49:09,600
my desire to. Another L for a slime, bro, is blue. There's no slime that's been produced. I'm happy to

8863
09:49:10,160 --> 09:49:16,480
do that. As I said, it is not diverse.

8864
09:49:21,600 --> 09:49:27,520
But I will do the whole, like, exposing my Gen 2 type thing, and I'll do the fun behind the scene

8865
09:49:27,520 --> 09:49:32,800
stuff. And you'll see, like, the first version versus the next version, like, one design.

8866
09:49:33,760 --> 09:49:40,560
I absolutely adore, but I had to say, I was like, look, the chest, you need to cover it up more.

8867
09:49:41,120 --> 09:49:46,320
We can't have that. That's not going to fly. So we had to change the chest. And then we got

8868
09:49:49,840 --> 09:49:53,920
one of the designs. I was like, please pull down the shirt. We're not going to get away with that.

8869
09:49:53,920 --> 09:50:00,160
Pull down the shirt. Pull down the shirt. Pull it down. Like, that kind of stuff.

8870
09:50:01,120 --> 09:50:04,640
And there's only one slime I want. Is it mine?

8871
09:50:07,840 --> 09:50:12,160
Yeah, why I dropped the floor slime puzzle, which we'll never see. The hell you're dying on.

8872
09:50:14,080 --> 09:50:23,440
Underbib. It was just too much. And it was like, so obviously, Sheebie and Azura's kind of been a bit

8873
09:50:23,440 --> 09:50:31,680
of a wake up call to be like, okay, we do have to play by the rules. And they are getting,

8874
09:50:33,920 --> 09:50:42,080
hold on, Azura. I'm trying to ramble about Gen 2. Yeah, what was I saying?

8875
09:50:42,960 --> 09:50:47,920
Yes, Azura and Sheebie have kind of smacked me awake and being like, holy shit, I actually could

8876
09:50:47,920 --> 09:50:58,960
have jeopardized their income due to my kind of stupidity of the approach. And so definitely

8877
09:50:58,960 --> 09:51:07,280
like, pull this t-shirt down and cover up just slightly more. No underbobbles? No, you cannot get.

8878
09:51:07,280 --> 09:51:14,000
No, underbobbles are completely unallowed, actually, on Twitch. I assume YouTube is probably

8879
09:51:14,000 --> 09:51:21,520
going to adopt that. I wouldn't be surprised. I got out of the shower and Shawnee's still going,

8880
09:51:21,520 --> 09:51:26,800
hell yeah. When is the game coming out? Would you have Gen 2 in it? Every generation's going to

8881
09:51:26,800 --> 09:51:32,400
have their own spin-off game. The games are made on a parody of popular Vtuber games.

8882
09:51:34,800 --> 09:51:39,360
And that is such a generic umbrella term of games that have been popular with Vtuber, but

8883
09:51:39,680 --> 09:51:47,280
every gen gets their own game. And yeah, the Vtuber crackdown. I guess that's where

8884
09:51:47,280 --> 09:51:58,320
Outfit Towers was coming. Yeah, it made me a bit scared when Azura got rejected for monetization

8885
09:51:58,320 --> 09:52:03,280
because I thought at first it was just her design, but I was like watching her stuff and I'm like,

8886
09:52:03,280 --> 09:52:08,560
well, to be fair, when you stream, you're actually only shoulders up. I mean, heck, right now I'm

8887
09:52:08,560 --> 09:52:13,600
literally shoulders up. There's nothing more to me. It's not like this is the stream all day long

8888
09:52:13,600 --> 09:52:20,160
type things. This isn't the stream all day long. The stream is just your head and nothing more,

8889
09:52:22,160 --> 09:52:24,480
like there's not really much more to it,

8890
09:52:28,800 --> 09:52:31,120
but Sony played by the rules, you know what I mean?

8891
09:52:31,120 --> 09:52:37,360
I'm sorry. I just did that out of nowhere. Sorry if I jumped here to anyone with that.

8892
09:52:40,080 --> 09:52:44,240
I didn't mean it. I meant to. I did it manually. Is that a bit bigger?

8893
09:52:46,960 --> 09:52:47,600
I can't remember.

8894
09:52:50,720 --> 09:52:57,440
It's not an orc. Okay, we're about to go. We're about to go. I repeat, we're going to be out of the

8895
09:52:57,920 --> 09:53:04,880
10,000s, out of the 10,000s. I kind of like when you have very covered

8896
09:53:04,880 --> 09:53:11,280
clothing, you just take off more and more layers. Jumped here, I wouldn't mind that. That was just

8897
09:53:11,280 --> 09:53:20,800
the whole stream. What just happened? I was on a rambling point about how you don't really see

8898
09:53:20,800 --> 09:53:26,080
any of the design. Like, I'll literally, like, when have you seen this? You like saw it once

8899
09:53:26,080 --> 09:53:29,680
in the work of the stream. Like, when's the last time you saw it? Like, so I'm standing on the

8900
09:53:29,680 --> 09:53:35,360
reeflings in game. Stand, stand, stand. Stand, stand, stand. Standing on the bank teller and

8901
09:53:35,360 --> 09:53:39,920
stand, stand. Like, you don't really see the outrageousness past the point.

8902
09:53:42,320 --> 09:53:49,120
10 hour marks and don't forget to do ink wah wah. The thighs, though he, I don't really get to show

8903
09:53:49,120 --> 09:53:58,240
that often. We're free. Quick commit it to memory, real. Wah, co-opulation.

8904
09:54:01,200 --> 09:54:07,040
Um, yeah, and tell beller makes their own payment process. Certain streamants always be

8905
09:54:07,040 --> 09:54:13,600
fucking over for that. Who's that AO? You're done for. Someone accused me of being the AO poster,

8906
09:54:13,600 --> 09:54:18,880
how dare you. You see your, you see your accusations and raise your, who goes there, huh?

8907
09:54:22,720 --> 09:54:26,640
If anyone goes AO, it's Azura because she literally asked for me to give her an AO.

8908
09:54:26,640 --> 09:54:33,840
I'm like, God bless feet. Thank you, Spidey. Thank you, investor. Spidey for your, your

8909
09:54:33,840 --> 09:54:38,640
kind. Thank you for everyone for your investments and beller. Oh, what, what did I just, I did

8910
09:54:38,640 --> 09:54:43,200
that way too early. Didn't I? Yeah, I did. Okay. I'm getting too excited.

8911
09:54:46,080 --> 09:54:52,080
Can't wait for Halo, eh, eh. Okay. Combat evolved. Well, like I looked that up and it was like time

8912
09:54:52,080 --> 09:54:57,280
to complete the game. Ten hours and I was like, no, it's not. It's like an old game. Old games,

8913
09:54:57,280 --> 09:55:01,600
they didn't even have enough memory to make such a waltz, so I just, I just punched the muffin

8914
09:55:01,600 --> 09:55:08,280
case and if you heard that when women wear a hoodie and nothing else oh design

8915
09:55:08,280 --> 09:55:17,120

Bing bong bing bong bong bing bing bong go to sleep America if you need go to

8921
09:55:51,960 --> 09:55:59,720
chilling at work. This is work a cock for Ozzy's. Shibuya's already start

8922
09:55:59,720 --> 09:56:06,640
outlining what to expect on him. She seems excited, I'm glad. Okay I'm fading,

8923
09:56:06,640 --> 09:56:10,980
almost sent a marrow. For you to Shibuya, I gotta go sleep. Oh, sleep tight, little

8924
09:56:10,980 --> 09:56:15,400
ofies man. As I said, once we finish, Azura's thing is about to be, her

8925
09:56:15,400 --> 09:56:18,480
vault's about to be finished, I'm just gonna ramble on Marshmallow for the rest of

8926
09:56:18,480 --> 09:56:29,800
the week. Azura, honestly? She cooked the stream, she absolutely cooked.

8927
09:56:31,120 --> 09:56:40,480
Mommy's the only substance I need. No, I need to sleep, I need to go. We're about to go

8928
09:56:40,480 --> 09:56:47,240
under 10K, that's what I want to see. So I want to see, and if I've got another two

8929
09:56:47,240 --> 09:56:53,400
hours, so what? That really will take us to 6K if I'm not too silly. Midday in

8930
09:56:53,400 --> 09:56:58,880
Western Australia right now, still going strong. From 4 a.m. to 4 p.p. under 4k

8931
09:56:58,880 --> 09:57:04,160
life, brah, you're legit gonna get the cape in front of us. I'm jealous, giving

8932
09:57:04,160 --> 09:57:12,120
your account right now. Password, email, and pin, go. Alright, I will watch the last

8933
09:57:12,120 --> 09:57:16,080
bit later, I've got work in a year. Rest well, sleep tight, rest well to those who

8934
09:57:16,120 --> 09:57:20,280
need to go as well. Please don't be afraid to go, pick your health over me, I promise

8935
09:57:20,280 --> 09:57:25,360
you it's the better choice. I am always streaming every single day, so I'll catch

8936
09:57:25,360 --> 09:57:30,400
you when I can catch you, okay? You don't have to worry. Yes, I'll give you my cape,

8937
09:57:30,400 --> 09:57:35,480
mommy. You don't have to worry, I'm on every day, okay? So please look after

8938
09:57:35,480 --> 09:57:38,040
yourself. If you need a hydra, you need to make your bed, you need to change the

8939
09:57:38,040 --> 09:57:42,000
sheets, you need to put a washing on, you need to do dishes, you need to prepare for

8940
09:57:42,000 --> 09:57:46,320
work, you need to lay out your outfit for tomorrow for work, you're allowed to go

8941
09:57:46,320 --> 09:57:51,680
do these little tasks, you brush your teeth, that kind of thing. Then you're

8942
09:57:51,680 --> 09:57:56,440
allowed to, okay? Marisa already ruined my sleep, so I'll show some just straight

8943
09:57:56,440 --> 09:58:02,120
up. I can't deal with being away from mommy, but I might miss you reading my

8944
09:58:02,140 --> 09:58:15,900
tomorrow. What is going on with Mrs. Irina? See, her mic does cut it. Oh, strong

8945
09:58:15,900 --> 09:58:19,760
as I'm gonna make this in five hours. I might need to try and sleep, so yes,

8946
09:58:19,760 --> 09:58:26,600
good night. See you next time, oh yeah. Little sis rain. I'm warm and cozy here,

8947
09:58:26,600 --> 09:58:35,080
I have a free day today. Aww. A free day and I've forced you to watch my gen mates wads

8948
09:58:35,080 --> 09:58:42,720
whilst I do wanes in Edgeville. Look at that, under 9k, isn't that gorgeous? That is absolutely

8949
09:58:42,720 --> 09:58:55,800
stunning. We started at 30,000 wanes to make and we're now at 9,000. Oh, that's stunning.

8950
09:58:55,800 --> 09:59:00,320
Not gonna lie, that made me leak a little bit realising that we actually did it. Like,

8951
09:59:00,320 --> 09:59:08,960
this is my first ever 99. Absolutely stunning. Absolutely stunning. Congrats on 18k, by the

8952
09:59:08,960 --> 09:59:15,440
way. Thank you so much! I don't know what the fuck is growing my channel so much. I genuinely,

8953
09:59:15,440 --> 09:59:20,360
like the meme videos are not being, you know, meme-ing anymore so I don't really know where

8954
09:59:20,360 --> 09:59:29,560
it's fucking coming from. It says- Oh, it says the hypnosis stream. I'm on to you subscribers.

8955
09:59:29,560 --> 09:59:35,280
I'm gonna be logged out in 10 minutes. Leave me alone, RuneScape. You're so stinky. Okay,

8956
09:59:35,280 --> 09:59:43,200
the hypnosis stream. No, it can't be. It says I gained 100 subscribers from hypnosis stream.

8957
09:59:43,200 --> 09:59:48,840
Where are you people coming from? I'm getting scared. I don't know, it's cause you're amazing

8958
09:59:48,840 --> 09:59:56,440
stuff. I don't know what's going on. It doesn't really tell you. Content audience? Did it say

8959
09:59:56,440 --> 10:00:07,280
audience? I guess it says new viewers. Like, is it that? It doesn't really tell you where

8960
10:00:07,280 --> 10:00:17,640
the traffic of subscribers comes from. That's bizarre. It says you're all American. That's

8961
10:00:17,640 --> 10:00:28,480
what it says. It says 46.7% of you are American. Doesn't show which other channel. They watch

8962
10:00:28,480 --> 10:00:34,640
Emmy, they watch Elias, I don't know. They watch Sheedy, they watch AC, they watch Mercy,

8963
10:00:34,640 --> 10:00:43,520
they watch Pillowdeer, they watch Smoothie, Druid, Groovey, Smart, Azura, Salky, Katz,

8964
10:00:43,520 --> 10:00:56,800
Kana, Yanagi from Pixel, Link, um, Fur, Faerie, Mayari. I've absolutely destroyed that name.

8965
10:00:56,800 --> 10:01:15,560
I'm so sorry. There's a lot of vowels in there. Nene from Kawaii. That's a lot of ASMR

8966
10:01:15,560 --> 10:01:31,640
videos. That's what it says. Your audience also watched. Your zoomer sister annoys you

8967
10:01:31,640 --> 10:01:39,160
with brain rot memes. My lips belong to you, Elias, I don't know. I bet you like kissing

8968
10:01:39,160 --> 10:01:50,880
your sister. Another Elias as well. Azura, Smoothie, Emmy. Is this Smoothie's clip? Another

8969
10:01:50,880 --> 10:02:00,280
Emmy? Okay, so Emmy is actually driving a lot of traffic to me, surprisingly. Emmy's

8970
10:02:00,280 --> 10:02:06,360
viewers, Emmy's, what your audience watches. So both Emmy and myself are getting watched

8971
10:02:06,360 --> 10:02:18,600
by Azura. What, the Smoothie clip is almost 150k? 150,000 people saw my fucking daughter's

8972
10:02:18,600 --> 10:02:28,320
chair. You degenerates. You filthy degenerates. Leave her alone. Okay, unless it's supporting

8973
10:02:28,320 --> 10:02:34,400
her, okay, that's different than Teehee. Didn't Emmy redirect into you from that stream? Trickle

10:02:35,400 --> 10:02:42,160
Are you exposing us? I just might. Maybe you'll blackmail me and then you have to do favors

10:02:42,160 --> 10:02:52,520

Grass, how dare you

8999
10:09:04,520 --> 10:09:06,520
Like I'm just MLG at this point

9000
10:09:06,520 --> 10:09:08,520
Just because

9001
10:09:08,520 --> 10:09:11,520
Just because you're a fake gamer boy

9002
10:09:11,520 --> 10:09:14,520
And you're being faced with a real gamer girl

9003
10:09:14,520 --> 10:09:15,520
That's right

9004
10:09:15,520 --> 10:09:17,520
You feel threatened

9005
10:09:17,520 --> 10:09:19,520
Oh that's right, the Scottish lass

9006
10:09:19,520 --> 10:09:20,520
Oh

9007
10:09:20,520 --> 10:09:22,520
She's threatening

9008
10:09:22,520 --> 10:09:24,520
Yeah, I don't know what the fuck I'm on about

9009
10:09:24,520 --> 10:09:25,520
I'm getting delirious

9010
10:09:25,520 --> 10:09:27,520
Hey Stroni, how are you feeling?

9011
10:09:27,520 --> 10:09:29,520
I just wanted to say thank you and also sorry

9012
10:09:29,520 --> 10:09:32,520
Oh, why are you saying sorry you good boy?

9013
10:09:32,520 --> 10:09:34,520
I was riefling her ass

9014
10:09:34,520 --> 10:09:36,520
Oh, wait

9015
10:09:36,520 --> 10:09:37,520
I knew that was gonna happen

9016
10:09:37,520 --> 10:09:38,520
Sorry

9017
10:09:38,520 --> 10:09:40,520
Sorry, I knew that

9018
10:09:40,520 --> 10:09:42,520
My bad, my apologies

9019
10:09:42,520 --> 10:09:44,520
Hold on, let me back in the servers real quick

9020
10:09:44,520 --> 10:09:46,520
She's a girl and she games

9021
10:09:46,520 --> 10:09:48,520
I got banned, I got banned

9022
10:09:48,520 --> 10:09:50,520
I can't believe it, I got banned

9023
10:09:50,520 --> 10:09:51,520
In real time

9024
10:09:51,520 --> 10:09:55,520
Not my wains for men and as if I didn't just get booted from this game

9025
10:09:55,520 --> 10:09:56,520
Bro

9026
10:09:56,520 --> 10:09:57,520
Let me in

9027
10:09:57,520 --> 10:10:00,520
Ooh, she left, I'm back already, I'm back

9028
10:10:00,520 --> 10:10:01,520
Don't worry, don't worry

9029
10:10:01,520 --> 10:10:05,520
12 over making wine or one minute, two seconds and then

9030
10:10:05,520 --> 10:10:07,520
What does that mean?

9031
10:10:07,520 --> 10:10:08,520
What does that mean?

9032
10:10:08,520 --> 10:10:09,520
Okay

9033
10:10:09,520 --> 10:10:10,520
Hi Stroni, hi Meepling

9034
10:10:10,520 --> 10:10:11,520
I just wanted to say thank you and also sorry

9035
10:10:11,520 --> 10:10:12,520
I was riefling her ass

9036
10:10:12,520 --> 10:10:13,520
Why do you care about it?

9037
10:10:13,520 --> 10:10:15,520
I wasn't expecting it to go the way it did

9038
10:10:15,520 --> 10:10:16,520
Oh

9039
10:10:16,520 --> 10:10:18,520
Bro, I went on a fucking...

9040
10:10:18,520 --> 10:10:19,520
I went on a tangent

9041
10:10:19,520 --> 10:10:22,520
I think I sat on that for like a whole 30 minutes

9042
10:10:22,520 --> 10:10:24,520
I don't know how long I was sitting on that bad boy

9043
10:10:25,520 --> 10:10:28,520
But I wanted to thank you for the heartfelt response

9044
10:10:28,520 --> 10:10:29,520
I was fighting tears during it

9045
10:10:29,520 --> 10:10:31,520
I also wanted to thank you and the other wreathlings as well

9046
10:10:31,520 --> 10:10:33,520
I was reading chat and seeing how everyone engaged with the question

9047
10:10:33,520 --> 10:10:35,520
It made me realize how awesome this community is

9048
10:10:35,520 --> 10:10:37,520
I'm so proud to be a part of it

9049
10:10:37,520 --> 10:10:38,520
Thank you Stroni

9050
10:10:38,520 --> 10:10:39,520
Oh thank you wreathling

9051
10:10:39,520 --> 10:10:42,520
And also thank you fellow brothers in the wreath for being so amazing

9052
10:10:42,520 --> 10:10:43,520
Aw

9053
10:10:43,520 --> 10:10:44,520
That's what I'm saying

9054
10:10:44,520 --> 10:10:45,520
Like that's a thing

9055
10:10:45,520 --> 10:10:47,520
It's a little just being chilling

9056
10:10:47,520 --> 10:10:49,520
Okay, we're all a bunch of wreaths

9057
10:10:51,520 --> 10:10:53,520
But we are just

9058
10:10:53,520 --> 10:10:54,520
It's just

9059
10:10:54,520 --> 10:10:55,520
It's chill

9060
10:10:55,520 --> 10:10:57,520
There's no expectations

9061
10:10:57,520 --> 10:10:59,520
You know the lurkers be lurking

9062
10:10:59,520 --> 10:11:01,520
The bing chillings be bing chilling

9063
10:11:01,520 --> 10:11:03,520
And you know there's no pressure from me

9064
10:11:03,520 --> 10:11:05,520
Or any other wreathlings for that matter

9065
10:11:09,520 --> 10:11:11,520
Failure's strong together, real

9066
10:11:13,520 --> 10:11:15,520
I never finished the sentence, okay

9067
10:11:15,520 --> 10:11:17,520
I never finished the sentence

9068
10:11:17,520 --> 10:11:19,520
I had a frog in my throat

9069
10:11:19,520 --> 10:11:21,520
Stroni, this is the comic I was referring to

9070
10:11:21,520 --> 10:11:23,520
When someone said thirsty a little flower

9071
10:11:23,520 --> 10:11:24,520
I'm gonna open

9072
10:11:24,520 --> 10:11:25,520
No!

9073
10:11:25,520 --> 10:11:27,520
You've given me a puzzle

9074
10:11:27,520 --> 10:11:29,520
You need to give me the full link

9075
10:11:29,520 --> 10:11:31,520
You need to give me the HTTPS

9076
10:11:31,520 --> 10:11:33,520
Like comma thing

9077
10:11:33,520 --> 10:11:35,520
Stop giving me puzzles

9078
10:11:35,520 --> 10:11:36,520
Give me the full link

9079
10:11:36,520 --> 10:11:38,520
And then just do the dot

9080
10:11:38,520 --> 10:11:40,520
Stop hiding things behind the IQ puzzle

9081
10:11:40,520 --> 10:11:42,520
And before this doesn't work

9082
10:11:42,520 --> 10:11:44,520
Yeah, 404 not found

9083
10:11:44,520 --> 10:11:46,520
I literally can't open the file

9084
10:11:46,520 --> 10:11:48,520
Cause you took away something

9085
10:11:48,520 --> 10:11:50,520
And I can't do it

9086
10:11:51,520 --> 10:11:53,520
I got 404

9087
10:11:53,520 --> 10:11:54,520
Fail not found

9088
10:11:54,520 --> 10:11:56,520
Stop giving me logic puzzles

9089
10:11:56,520 --> 10:11:58,520
It's been 10 hours

9090
10:11:59,520 --> 10:12:01,520
Mummy, I've never done NNN before

9091
10:12:01,520 --> 10:12:03,520
But I wanna give you control

9092
10:12:03,520 --> 10:12:05,520
And I wanna be a good wreathling

9093
10:12:05,520 --> 10:12:07,520
If I had encouragement and orders

9094
10:12:07,520 --> 10:12:08,520
I think I could do it

9095
10:12:08,520 --> 10:12:10,520
Hold back for a month

9096
10:12:13,520 --> 10:12:15,520
I don't know, I'd need to plan it

9097
10:12:15,520 --> 10:12:17,520
Like proper plan it

9098
10:12:17,520 --> 10:12:19,520
I'm gonna

9099
10:12:21,520 --> 10:12:22,520
I'm gonna take a wild guess

9100
10:12:22,520 --> 10:12:24,520
And say the choosing beggar was

9101
10:12:24,520 --> 10:12:26,520
I know, absolutely not that girl

9102
10:12:29,520 --> 10:12:30,520
Wait, what?

9103
10:12:30,520 --> 10:12:33,520
No, no, it was absolutely not that girl

9104
10:12:33,520 --> 10:12:35,520
No, you won't be able to tell

9105
10:12:36,520 --> 10:12:38,520
No, it was not that girl

9106
10:12:38,520 --> 10:12:39,520
That girl's absolutely fantastic

9107
10:12:39,520 --> 10:12:41,520
She is

9108
10:12:41,520 --> 10:12:43,520
Nothing but sweet

9109
10:12:43,520 --> 10:12:44,520
She's pure kindness

9110
10:12:44,520 --> 10:12:45,520
And maybe you should have said

9111
10:12:45,520 --> 10:12:47,520
Please don't speculate

9112
10:12:47,520 --> 10:12:49,520
Because of this reason

9113
10:12:49,520 --> 10:12:51,520
If you get the wrong girl

9114
10:12:51,520 --> 10:12:53,520
You know, it's not very nice

9115
10:12:53,520 --> 10:12:54,520
No, it's absolutely not her

9116
10:12:54,520 --> 10:12:56,520
She is nothing but lovely

9117
10:12:56,520 --> 10:12:58,520
And juicy and gorgeous

9118
10:12:58,520 --> 10:13:00,520
And no, it is not her

9119
10:13:01,520 --> 10:13:03,520
Who here is a proud wreathling

9120
10:13:03,520 --> 10:13:04,520
Stop right now

9121
10:13:04,520 --> 10:13:06,520
We can't start typing that in chat

9122
10:13:07,520 --> 10:13:08,520
The clip earlier

9123
10:13:08,520 --> 10:13:10,520
These are the back clubs

9124
10:13:10,520 --> 10:13:12,520
Of clip tabs currently

9125
10:13:14,520 --> 10:13:15,520
Did you give me

9126
10:13:15,520 --> 10:13:17,520
See, there's no logic puzzle this time

9127
10:13:17,520 --> 10:13:18,520
I think you can only

9128
10:13:18,520 --> 10:13:20,520
I think you only need to do it on one show

9129
10:13:20,520 --> 10:13:22,520
Stop when it comes to

9130
10:13:23,520 --> 10:13:24,520
Hold on, hold on

9131
10:13:24,520 --> 10:13:26,520
Let me, let me cook

9132
10:13:26,520 --> 10:13:28,520
And before it says 404 again

9133
10:13:28,520 --> 10:13:30,520
Yeah, damn

9134
10:13:30,520 --> 10:13:32,520
You're clipping the fuck out of this

9135
10:13:32,520 --> 10:13:33,520
Okay, now

9136
10:13:35,520 --> 10:13:36,520
I'd show it on stream

9137
10:13:36,520 --> 10:13:37,520
But it might break Malbia

9138
10:13:38,520 --> 10:13:40,520
Johnny, I made the meme

9139
10:13:40,520 --> 10:13:41,520
You wanted a mercy at the all club

9140
10:13:41,520 --> 10:13:42,520
A bit of a

9141
10:13:43,520 --> 10:13:45,520
Wait, what did I ask for?

9142
10:13:45,520 --> 10:13:46,520
Bro, I'm so sorry

9143
10:13:46,520 --> 10:13:47,520
I hate to be like

9144
10:13:47,520 --> 10:13:48,520
Wait, what did I say?

9145
10:13:48,520 --> 10:13:49,520
But on it

9146
10:13:49,520 --> 10:13:51,520
I'm getting very tired

9147
10:13:54,520 --> 10:13:55,520
Oh my god

9148
10:13:55,520 --> 10:13:56,520
Right, okay

9149
10:13:56,520 --> 10:13:57,520
If this crashes my OBS

9150
10:13:57,520 --> 10:13:59,520
Don't worry, I'll come right back

9151
10:13:59,520 --> 10:14:00,520
But this is worth it to show

9152
10:14:00,520 --> 10:14:02,520
I remember the meme now

9153
10:14:02,520 --> 10:14:04,520
I remember the meme, hold on

9154
10:14:06,520 --> 10:14:07,520
I remember the meme

9155
10:14:09,520 --> 10:14:11,520
It's mercy at the all club

9156
10:14:11,520 --> 10:14:13,520
And it's all of us coming

9157
10:14:13,520 --> 10:14:16,520
De-de-de-deen

9158
10:14:17,520 --> 10:14:18,520
Literally

9159
10:14:18,520 --> 10:14:20,520
Look at all of our hairs as well

9160
10:14:20,520 --> 10:14:21,520
That's so good

9161
10:14:21,520 --> 10:14:22,520
That's such a good ad

9162
10:14:22,520 --> 10:14:23,520
Well done, Rufa

9163
10:14:23,520 --> 10:14:24,520
And that's so good

9164
10:14:25,520 --> 10:14:26,520
Let me show it to you

9165
10:14:27,520 --> 10:14:28,520
John ReefTard is my full name

9166
10:14:29,520 --> 10:14:31,520
Stop, we're gonna get in trouble

9167
10:14:32,520 --> 10:14:33,520
We're actually gonna get in trouble

9168
10:14:33,520 --> 10:14:34,520
Rufa

9169
10:14:34,520 --> 10:14:35,520
That's such a good meme

9170
10:14:36,520 --> 10:14:37,520
Well done, Rufa

9171
10:14:37,520 --> 10:14:38,520
And that's actually what I mean

9172
10:14:38,520 --> 10:14:39,520
Don't read this out loud

9173
10:14:43,520 --> 10:14:53,520
I'll try you like that far co-addon't you?

9174
10:14:53,520 --> 10:14:55,520
What little things did you do at your den meme?

9175
10:14:55,520 --> 10:14:56,520
I answered that.

9176
10:14:56,520 --> 10:15:01,440
Oh right but that's because you asked to make sure I don't forget.

9177
10:15:01,440 --> 10:15:02,680
I love Bomi so much.

9178
10:15:02,680 --> 10:15:04,720
If she has a thousand reflens then I'm one of them.

9179
10:15:04,720 --> 10:15:06,240
If she has a hundred then I'm one of them.

9180
10:15:06,240 --> 10:15:08,840
And if mommy only has one reflend then that reflend is me.

9181
10:15:09,840 --> 10:15:14,840
Hi I'm new here and I'm hooked.

9182
10:15:14,840 --> 10:15:23,840
Was it the ten hours of winemaking an Edgeville gameplay that just really spoke to your soul reflend?

9183
10:15:23,840 --> 10:15:30,840
It just over-empowered you that the duration the streamer might have.

9184
10:15:31,840 --> 10:15:35,840
Momente refleng.

9185
10:15:35,840 --> 10:15:41,840
I just want to let you know that I'm very blessed to have spawned in a family where emotions are fine and there's love all around.

9186
10:15:41,840 --> 10:15:48,840
Outsiders are surprised about how my flutons are very close and how we're very close with our cousins too.

9187
10:15:48,840 --> 10:15:54,840
One of the reasons I got attached to you is because of how genuine you are without being...

9188
10:15:54,840 --> 10:15:59,840
I'm getting nervous can I say this stuff out loud?

9189
10:15:59,840 --> 10:16:02,840
It's like I'm just interacting with one of the family members.

9190
10:16:02,840 --> 10:16:05,840
Please do not change but also take care of yourself physically and emotionally.

9191
10:16:05,840 --> 10:16:06,840
Are you kidding me right now?

9192
10:16:06,840 --> 10:16:08,840
All the loaded maros can leave at the top.

9193
10:16:08,840 --> 10:16:10,840
I love your videos and this live today.

9194
10:16:10,840 --> 10:16:13,840
You are awesome and I'm actually glad I'm here to watch you some more.

9195
10:16:13,840 --> 10:16:16,840
I'm really in love from reverse.

9196
10:16:16,840 --> 10:16:19,840
Oh my gosh thank you.

9197
10:16:20,840 --> 10:16:29,840
You might be eating those words tomorrow because I'm releasing pregnant with you ASMR in less than 24 hours.

9198
10:16:29,840 --> 10:16:30,840
Reverse.

9199
10:16:30,840 --> 10:16:32,840
Thank you for the super job.

9200
10:16:32,840 --> 10:16:33,840
I'm not kidding.

9201
10:16:33,840 --> 10:16:42,840
You genuinely might be eating those words because I made an ASMR where you're pregnant.

9202
10:16:42,840 --> 10:16:48,840
In my tummy and I don't regret it and I'm gonna play it and yeah.

9203
10:16:48,840 --> 10:16:54,840
It's worth the risk real.

9204
10:16:54,840 --> 10:16:56,840
Pregnant with me by me.

9205
10:16:56,840 --> 10:17:01,840
True.

9206
10:17:02,840 --> 10:17:10,840
I'm sure you know trust plays a massive factor in how enjoyable hypno content can be so while you may be inexperienced

9207
10:17:10,840 --> 10:17:16,840
in producing that kind of content just know your personality couldn't be more perfect for it.

9208
10:17:16,840 --> 10:17:21,840
Even when I want to push your buttons a little and I know it's wrong.

9209
10:17:21,840 --> 10:17:28,840
Even when I know it's bad and I shouldn't.

9210
10:17:29,840 --> 10:17:34,840
Thank you for the underwear update.

9211
10:17:34,840 --> 10:17:36,840
Now I really want to see them.

9212
10:17:36,840 --> 10:17:38,840
You're getting my underwear.

9213
10:17:38,840 --> 10:17:39,840
Oh no wait maybe.

9214
10:17:39,840 --> 10:17:46,840
Maybe I'll take a picture with underwear on and then take them off.

9215
10:17:46,840 --> 10:17:50,840
And then it's like a little photo shoot.

9216
10:17:50,840 --> 10:17:52,840
Not too many keys.

9217
10:17:59,840 --> 10:18:03,840
But I might not be able to catch stream today so here's a tribute.

9218
10:18:03,840 --> 10:18:04,840
That's my kind of reason.

9219
10:18:04,840 --> 10:18:06,840
You're all wet.

9220
10:18:06,840 --> 10:18:07,840
You're all wet.

9221
10:18:07,840 --> 10:18:09,840
It's shocking to hear.

9222
10:18:09,840 --> 10:18:11,840
How much money from after three days?

9223
10:18:11,840 --> 10:18:12,840
Bro.

9224
10:18:17,840 --> 10:18:18,840
Okay.

9225
10:18:18,840 --> 10:18:19,840
I have a fish.

9226
10:18:21,840 --> 10:18:23,840
Fish, fish, fish.

9227
10:18:24,840 --> 10:18:27,840
Would it be alright if I sent a tentacle pic for your birthday?

9228
10:18:27,840 --> 10:18:28,840
As a gift?

9229
10:18:28,840 --> 10:18:29,840
Yes?

9230
10:18:29,840 --> 10:18:31,840
Oh my god wait.

9231
10:18:31,840 --> 10:18:36,840
Can I get like a mask like thing going on?

9232
10:18:36,840 --> 10:18:39,840
Oh no there's no way I can say that name.

9233
10:18:39,840 --> 10:18:41,840
Lex, riot.

9234
10:18:41,840 --> 10:18:43,840
Lex, riot.

9235
10:18:43,840 --> 10:18:44,840
Lex, riot.

9236
10:18:44,840 --> 10:18:46,840
Thank you for becoming a member.

9237
10:18:46,840 --> 10:18:47,840
Lex, riot.

9238
10:18:47,840 --> 10:18:48,840
Riot.

9239
10:18:48,840 --> 10:18:50,840
How do I say that?

9240
10:18:50,840 --> 10:18:51,840
Lex.

9241
10:18:51,840 --> 10:18:53,840
Lex or riot.

9242
10:18:53,840 --> 10:18:55,840
Lex or riot.

9243
10:18:55,840 --> 10:18:56,840
Yeah.

9244
10:18:56,840 --> 10:18:57,840
That's your name now.

9245
10:18:57,840 --> 10:18:58,840
There you go.

9246
10:18:58,840 --> 10:18:59,840
Nicknames all yours.

9247
10:18:59,840 --> 10:19:00,840
Close.

9248
10:19:00,840 --> 10:19:01,840
Lex right.

9249
10:19:01,840 --> 10:19:03,840
Oh they're really obvious.

9250
10:19:03,840 --> 10:19:06,840
That's actually really obvious now that you said that.

9251
10:19:06,840 --> 10:19:07,840
Bye.

9252
10:19:07,840 --> 10:19:08,840
Lex right.

9253
10:19:08,840 --> 10:19:10,840
Thank you for becoming a member.

9254
10:19:10,840 --> 10:19:12,840
Not the tentacle train.

9255
10:19:12,840 --> 10:19:14,840
We need to photoshop us with eight of them.

9256
10:19:14,840 --> 10:19:16,840
Oh I think that would actually be a bit scary.

9257
10:19:16,840 --> 10:19:18,840
Not gonna lie.

9258
10:19:19,840 --> 10:19:20,840
Um.

9259
10:19:22,840 --> 10:19:24,840
May we have a kiss please mummy?

9260
10:19:24,840 --> 10:19:27,840
You get me addicted each time you do them.

9261
10:19:27,840 --> 10:19:28,840
Um.

9262
10:19:30,840 --> 10:19:32,840
Do you say kiss or kiss?

9263
10:19:32,840 --> 10:19:33,840
Oh no.

9264
10:19:33,840 --> 10:19:35,840
Your language you used you said I kiss.

9265
10:19:35,840 --> 10:19:37,840
Which is singular.

9266
10:19:37,840 --> 10:19:40,840
That's right you're getting whipped to be an English language.

9267
10:19:40,840 --> 10:19:42,840
Um.

9268
10:19:42,840 --> 10:19:44,840
Congrats on 18k mumme.

9269
10:19:44,840 --> 10:19:45,840
Thank you Rhysling.

9270
10:19:45,840 --> 10:19:47,840
You ask where they come from but come on.

9271
10:19:47,840 --> 10:19:49,840
The way you keep an open mind to your shenanigans.

9272
10:19:49,840 --> 10:19:50,840
The way you accept us all.

9273
10:19:50,840 --> 10:19:52,840
And make streams comfy in second homes.

9274
10:19:52,840 --> 10:19:53,840
Go to love support.

9275
10:19:53,840 --> 10:19:55,840
Tin foil rambles.

9276
10:19:55,840 --> 10:19:58,840
And drain tentacles.

9277
10:19:58,840 --> 10:20:00,840
We adore and love you unironically.

9278
10:20:00,840 --> 10:20:01,840
Oh I love you too.

9279
10:20:01,840 --> 10:20:03,840
I'll never feel you don't deserve this.

9280
10:20:03,840 --> 10:20:04,840
I'm just like.

9281
10:20:04,840 --> 10:20:06,840
But why?

9282
10:20:06,840 --> 10:20:08,840
Speaking of pregnancy.

9283
10:20:08,840 --> 10:20:10,840
I just caught a mosquito trying to suck me.

9284
10:20:10,840 --> 10:20:15,840
I was going to say mosquito girl but then I said no.

9285
10:20:15,840 --> 10:20:16,840
Cause I don't like mosquitoes.

9286
10:20:16,840 --> 10:20:17,840
Um.

9287
10:20:17,840 --> 10:20:19,840
Apparently baby carried the DNA of the host.

9288
10:20:19,840 --> 10:20:21,840
I ain't paying the child support.

9289
10:20:21,840 --> 10:20:22,840
Real.

9290
10:20:22,840 --> 10:20:24,840
Okto pee pee jumpscare.

9291
10:20:24,840 --> 10:20:26,840
Won't know the idea again.

9292
10:20:26,840 --> 10:20:29,840
I'm that mosquito for real.

9293
10:20:29,840 --> 10:20:31,840
You would never need to cook.

9294
10:20:31,840 --> 10:20:32,840
For you have cake for us.

9295
10:20:32,840 --> 10:20:33,840
You mean bake.

9296
10:20:33,840 --> 10:20:35,840
You would never have to bake.

9297
10:20:35,840 --> 10:20:37,840
Because you have enough cake for us Rhysling.

9298
10:20:37,840 --> 10:20:39,840
Is that what you meant to say darling?

9299
10:20:39,840 --> 10:20:40,840
Be honest.

9300
10:20:40,840 --> 10:20:41,840
Sweetheart.

9301
10:20:41,840 --> 10:20:43,840
Is that what you meant to say?

9302
10:20:43,840 --> 10:20:45,840
They put you would never need to cook.

9303
10:20:45,840 --> 10:20:48,840
For you have enough cake for us Rhysling.

9304
10:20:48,840 --> 10:20:51,840
You mean I would never have to bake again.

9305
10:20:51,840 --> 10:20:53,840
Cause I have enough cake for you.

9306
10:20:53,840 --> 10:20:55,840
Is that what you mean QAPI?

9307
10:20:55,840 --> 10:20:57,840
I think that's what you meant.

9308
10:20:57,840 --> 10:20:59,840
I think that's what you meant.

9309
10:20:59,840 --> 10:21:01,840
What is that?

9310
10:21:01,840 --> 10:21:03,840
A disk of returning.

9311
10:21:03,840 --> 10:21:04,840
Return.

9312
10:21:04,840 --> 10:21:05,840
To sender.

9313
10:21:05,840 --> 10:21:06,840
Whee.

9314
10:21:06,840 --> 10:21:11,840
There's enough cake to go around here.

9315
10:21:11,840 --> 10:21:16,840
Hi mommy just letting you know you actually have 400 extra wines.

9316
10:21:16,840 --> 10:21:17,840
Aha.

9317
10:21:17,840 --> 10:21:18,840
Ok.

9318
10:21:18,840 --> 10:21:25,840
How did you do the math so quickly in between me farting around?

9319
10:21:25,840 --> 10:21:27,840
How do you do that?

9320
10:21:27,840 --> 10:21:30,840
Can we have more kisses please?

9321
10:21:31,840 --> 10:21:33,840
That's more like it.

9322
10:21:40,840 --> 10:21:42,840
Is that better?

9323
10:21:42,840 --> 10:21:44,840
See that multiple that time.

9324
10:21:44,840 --> 10:21:46,840
Let me get one of them.

9325
10:21:48,840 --> 10:21:50,840
To feed the French during the revolution.

9326
10:21:50,840 --> 10:21:52,840
Let them eat cake.

9327
10:21:52,840 --> 10:21:56,840
Did you know that Marie Antoinette never actually said eat them?

9328
10:21:56,840 --> 10:21:58,840
Oh ok right.

9329
10:21:58,840 --> 10:22:03,840
I was going to say a joke and I fucking started so badly through the damn thing.

9330
10:22:03,840 --> 10:22:04,840
I don't want to say it anymore.

9331
10:22:04,840 --> 10:22:05,840
In anger.

9332
10:22:05,840 --> 10:22:09,840
I don't want to say the freaking joke anymore.

9333
10:22:09,840 --> 10:22:11,840
I'm raging.

9334
10:22:11,840 --> 10:22:14,840
I literally fucking ruined it.

9335
10:22:14,840 --> 10:22:16,840
Anyway.

9336
10:22:16,840 --> 10:22:18,840
Made my day even brighter.

9337
10:22:18,840 --> 10:22:20,840
Mr. Blue Sky.

9338
10:22:20,840 --> 10:22:25,840
Why did you have to hide for so long?

9339
10:22:25,840 --> 10:22:27,840
Hello.

9340
10:22:34,840 --> 10:22:35,840
Ok.

9341
10:22:35,840 --> 10:22:36,840
I thought I didn't catch up.

9342
10:22:36,840 --> 10:22:45,840
But I have caught up because of the people in sharing their story with me.

9343
10:22:45,840 --> 10:22:48,840
But I don't want to read anything out loud because that's personal.

9344
10:22:48,840 --> 10:22:49,840
I thought I wasn't caught up.

9345
10:22:49,840 --> 10:22:50,840
I am caught up.

9346
10:22:55,840 --> 10:22:57,840
Mummy can we please have some cake?

9347
10:22:57,840 --> 10:22:58,840
We've been good rooflings.

9348
10:22:58,840 --> 10:23:00,840
20k and you get your cake deal.

9349
10:23:03,840 --> 10:23:06,840
There's a website that tells you I'm not that autistic.

9350
10:23:06,840 --> 10:23:07,840
What?

9351
10:23:10,840 --> 10:23:13,840
There's a website that tells you I'm not that autistic.

9352
10:23:13,840 --> 10:23:15,840
What do you mean by that?

9353
10:23:15,840 --> 10:23:17,840
Is this not finished yet?

9354
10:23:17,840 --> 10:23:19,840
Everyone gets a 20k.

9355
10:23:19,840 --> 10:23:21,840
I'll upload the pregnancy tomorrow.

9356
10:23:21,840 --> 10:23:23,840
I'll drop down to 15 so I've got some time to spawn.

9357
10:23:23,840 --> 10:23:25,840
I need to get my glist.

9358
10:23:25,840 --> 10:23:26,840
Don't!

9359
10:23:26,840 --> 10:23:27,840
Don't!

9360
10:23:27,840 --> 10:23:31,840
That's funny but don't because it like fucking destroys channels.

9361
10:23:31,840 --> 10:23:33,840
Fucking people thought we were doing that at debut.

9362
10:23:33,840 --> 10:23:36,840
They were like oh my god they're button subscribers.

9363
10:23:36,840 --> 10:23:42,840
If there's a search of subscribers, you should like fucking scrub them all away.

9364
10:23:42,840 --> 10:23:44,840
You know.

9365
10:23:44,840 --> 10:23:46,840
We're trying our best.

9366
10:23:47,840 --> 10:23:53,840
You can look up your username and how much XP and plug it into a card.

9367
10:23:58,840 --> 10:24:00,840
Oh there's a website that tells you that.

9368
10:24:00,840 --> 10:24:02,840
You can see my XP live?

9369
10:24:02,840 --> 10:24:05,840
Stop I feel so exposed.

9370
10:24:06,840 --> 10:24:08,840
You can see my XP?

9371
10:24:09,840 --> 10:24:10,840
Mine?

9372
10:24:10,840 --> 10:24:11,840
Mine?

9373
10:24:13,840 --> 10:24:15,840
The calling part 5 literally.

9374
10:24:17,840 --> 10:24:19,840
Your cooking XP remain in your walnut.

9375
10:24:19,840 --> 10:24:21,840
Who you calling a walnut?

9376
10:24:21,840 --> 10:24:23,840
Your big jobby.

9377
10:24:25,840 --> 10:24:27,840
Who you calling a walnut?

9378
10:24:27,840 --> 10:24:29,840
Your peaking pie?

9379
10:24:29,840 --> 10:24:31,840
Eating bastard.

9380
10:24:33,840 --> 10:24:36,840
I didn't even know how I would insult you.

9381
10:24:36,840 --> 10:24:39,840
Disbelief over viewer's popularity shouldn't be so strong.

9382
10:24:39,840 --> 10:24:41,840
Viewer is the first member of the group.

9383
10:24:41,840 --> 10:24:45,840
There's a website where you can plug in the XP in the back.

9384
10:24:45,840 --> 10:24:47,840
I complained.

9385
10:24:47,840 --> 10:24:50,840
I'll force my friends and family to even the youngins.

9386
10:24:50,840 --> 10:24:53,840
Nope that's not how it works around these powers.

9387
10:24:53,840 --> 10:24:56,840
We Anakin Skywalker them fuck.

9388
10:25:00,840 --> 10:25:02,840
I don't know if you'll let's say that but yeah.

9389
10:25:02,840 --> 10:25:04,840
We don't own our brand for you.

9390
10:25:07,840 --> 10:25:09,840
I hate them.

9391
10:25:11,840 --> 10:25:13,840
What is the quote Anakin Skywalker?

9392
10:25:19,840 --> 10:25:21,840
It's a quote. Get the quote up right now.

9393
10:25:22,840 --> 10:25:27,840
Not just the men but the women and children too.

9394
10:25:27,840 --> 10:25:29,840
They're like animals.

9395
10:25:29,840 --> 10:25:33,840
So I slaughtered them like animals.

9396
10:25:33,840 --> 10:25:35,840
I hate them.

9397
10:25:35,840 --> 10:25:37,840
That's the...

9398
10:25:37,840 --> 10:25:39,840
Master Stroney there are too many of them.

9399
10:25:39,840 --> 10:25:43,840
Oh sorry that was the kid's voice.

9400
10:25:43,840 --> 10:25:46,840
Master Stroney there are too many of them.

9401
10:25:46,840 --> 10:25:48,840
What are we going to do?

9402
10:25:51,840 --> 10:25:54,840
You underestimate my power.

9403
10:25:59,840 --> 10:26:02,840
I hate women and children.

9404
10:26:02,840 --> 10:26:04,840
I hate them.

9405
10:26:08,840 --> 10:26:10,840
We are real unhappy with them.

9406
10:26:10,840 --> 10:26:12,840
That was perfect for the youngling.

9407
10:26:12,840 --> 10:26:14,840
I always stuck in my head.

9408
10:26:14,840 --> 10:26:18,840
Master Skywalker there are too many of them.

9409
10:26:18,840 --> 10:26:20,840
What are we going to do?

9410
10:26:21,840 --> 10:26:23,840
I don't know I just sounded British.

9411
10:26:23,840 --> 10:26:25,840
I assume it was a British child.

9412
10:26:26,840 --> 10:26:28,840
There's too many of them.

9413
10:26:29,840 --> 10:26:35,840
I just remember the accent of the wee chubby cheeks.

9414
10:26:35,840 --> 10:26:37,840
He's adorable.

9415
10:26:37,840 --> 10:26:38,840
He did a really good job.

9416
10:26:38,840 --> 10:26:43,840
Mummy please pin me against the wall and hold my tentacle hostage.

9417
10:26:43,840 --> 10:26:46,840
I want to be drained in milk of my ink.

9418
10:26:46,840 --> 10:26:50,840
But while you do a tinfoil rant do you want the tinfoil rant?

9419
10:26:50,840 --> 10:26:55,840
It would be a lot easier for me to do the tinfoil rant than the park bench if I'm being honest.

9420
10:26:55,840 --> 10:27:03,840
If you guys have the patience for me to instead do the park bench as the next one

9421
10:27:03,840 --> 10:27:09,840
and then I'll do tinfoil rant like now if that makes sense.

9422
10:27:09,840 --> 10:27:12,840
Like the one that's supposed to go up this month.

9423
10:27:12,840 --> 10:27:14,840
So just do a little swapsies.

9424
10:27:14,840 --> 10:27:18,840
And then someone will be like oh my god Stroney you're scamming me.

9425
10:27:18,840 --> 10:27:20,840
Where is this one audio you promised?

9426
10:27:20,840 --> 10:27:22,840
I'm like fucking relaxed.

9427
10:27:22,840 --> 10:27:24,840
Fucking relaxed.

9428
10:27:24,840 --> 10:27:26,840
The only thing you can come in the night.

9429
10:27:26,840 --> 10:27:28,840
You really like old school runes.

9430
10:27:28,840 --> 10:27:30,840
It's a goal.

9431
10:27:32,840 --> 10:27:34,840
It's a goal okay.

9432
10:27:34,840 --> 10:27:38,840
I want 100 notone.

9433
10:27:38,840 --> 10:27:42,840
I want level 99 and one runescape skill.

9434
10:27:42,840 --> 10:27:44,840
And I'm almost there okay.

9435
10:27:45,840 --> 10:27:50,840
I just have another 99,000 wines to go.

9436
10:27:51,840 --> 10:27:52,840
Wait no.

9437
10:27:52,840 --> 10:27:54,840
9,000 wines to go.

9438
10:27:54,840 --> 10:27:56,840
9,000 wines.

9439
10:27:56,840 --> 10:27:58,840
I far meant one.

9440
10:27:58,840 --> 10:28:00,840
I put it in the bank.

9441
10:28:00,840 --> 10:28:03,840
8,999 wines to go.

9442
10:28:05,840 --> 10:28:06,840
You know?

9443
10:28:06,840 --> 10:28:08,840
That's what I'm doing.

9444
10:28:12,840 --> 10:28:15,840
Stroney have you ever had horchat?

9445
10:28:15,840 --> 10:28:19,840
It's a Mexican drink made by soaking rice in water for 24 hours.

9446
10:28:19,840 --> 10:28:21,840
Then blending with milk sugar and cinnamon.

9447
10:28:21,840 --> 10:28:22,840
It's actually refreshing.

9448
10:28:22,840 --> 10:28:23,840
I've never done it.

9449
10:28:23,840 --> 10:28:26,840
I want to take in puppy Stroney for a walk Oreo.

9450
10:28:26,840 --> 10:28:28,840
I don't know how to write that.

9451
10:28:28,840 --> 10:28:31,840
You're still going aw yeah.

9452
10:28:31,840 --> 10:28:35,840
Never met a girl with such stamina before have you?

9453
10:28:37,840 --> 10:28:40,840
Stroney we need to cook.

9454
10:28:42,840 --> 10:28:44,840
What did Stroney just call me?

9455
10:28:44,840 --> 10:28:46,840
My first 99 was smithing.

9456
10:28:46,840 --> 10:28:47,840
I don't know why.

9457
10:28:47,840 --> 10:28:50,840
Yeah I picked cooking because I'm a woman.

9458
10:28:50,840 --> 10:28:52,840
That's literally it.

9459
10:28:52,840 --> 10:28:55,840
Out of everything I could have literally picked,

9460
10:28:55,840 --> 10:28:58,840
my brain was like well this one.

9461
10:28:58,840 --> 10:29:02,840
So there's no rhyme or reason on what your first 99 is.

9462
10:29:02,840 --> 10:29:03,840
Although someone said,

9463
10:29:03,840 --> 10:29:06,840
I think I have enough money to do fletching unironically

9464
10:29:06,840 --> 10:29:08,840
so I might just go for it.

9465
10:29:08,840 --> 10:29:12,840
Mummy jerks your pintas to extract all the corruption

9466
10:29:12,840 --> 10:29:15,840
that's thrown in the balls of tinfoil random.

9467
10:29:17,840 --> 10:29:20,840
She can stream for 12 hours but she's done after 2 minutes.

9468
10:29:20,840 --> 10:29:22,840
Do you mind?

9469
10:29:22,840 --> 10:29:23,840
Do you mind?

9470
10:29:23,840 --> 10:29:26,840
Okay look, look.

9471
10:29:28,840 --> 10:29:29,840
You know what?

9472
10:29:29,840 --> 10:29:33,840
Sorry to the average jewel that needs to get punched in the face

9473
10:29:33,840 --> 10:29:35,840
and their leg caught in a bear trap.

9474
10:29:35,840 --> 10:29:37,840
Just to fucking come okay?

9475
10:29:37,840 --> 10:29:39,840
Excuse me for being a quick show.

9476
10:29:40,840 --> 10:29:42,840
Like why am I getting straight?

9477
10:29:42,840 --> 10:29:45,840
I never did anything.

9478
10:29:45,840 --> 10:29:47,840
Okay 2 minutes is plenty of time.

9479
10:29:47,840 --> 10:29:48,840
True though.

9480
10:29:48,840 --> 10:29:51,840
Like actually true though.

9481
10:29:51,840 --> 10:29:54,840
Like if death is like you've got 5 minutes

9482
10:29:54,840 --> 10:29:56,840
I'm like thanks mate.

9483
10:29:56,840 --> 10:29:59,840
I can probably bang out to appreciate that.

9484
10:29:59,840 --> 10:30:01,840
Stop!

9485
10:30:01,840 --> 10:30:03,840
Um...

9486
10:30:08,840 --> 10:30:11,840
We're not asking for a lot just for 4 extra minutes.

9487
10:30:11,840 --> 10:30:14,840
Is that how much extra time you need?

9488
10:30:14,840 --> 10:30:17,840
I'll be done in 2, you'll be done in 6.

9489
10:30:17,840 --> 10:30:18,840
Appreciate the amount of time.

9490
10:30:18,840 --> 10:30:19,840
Let's work for me and you get yours.

9491
10:30:19,840 --> 10:30:20,840
Ah ha!

9492
10:30:20,840 --> 10:30:22,840
Honestly!

9493
10:30:22,840 --> 10:30:24,840
I gotta make sure you keep the calories on you.

9494
10:30:24,840 --> 10:30:26,840
I can't have you working too hard now.

9495
10:30:26,840 --> 10:30:27,840
Come on.

9496
10:30:27,840 --> 10:30:29,840
Meanwhile you can tell Stony she's a good girl

9497
10:30:29,840 --> 10:30:31,840
and she'll have to play one hand

9498
10:30:31,840 --> 10:30:33,840
to see if she can grab her thighs

9499
10:30:33,840 --> 10:30:35,840
to knock herself out of it.

9500
10:30:35,840 --> 10:30:37,840
What?!

9501
10:30:37,840 --> 10:30:39,840
Orrrysy!

9502
10:30:42,840 --> 10:30:44,840
If you're getting 3...

9503
10:30:44,840 --> 10:30:46,840
You're getting 3 death of knocking of 5.

9504
10:30:46,840 --> 10:30:48,840
2 and 5 is enough.

9505
10:30:48,840 --> 10:30:50,840
Don't mind it.

9506
10:30:50,840 --> 10:30:51,840
You're dying in 5.

9507
10:30:51,840 --> 10:30:54,840
Ah just enough time honestly.

9508
10:30:54,840 --> 10:30:55,840
I can't believe it.

9509
10:30:55,840 --> 10:30:57,840
I can't believe my scottish

9510
10:30:57,840 --> 10:31:00,840
leaked shock of the movie.

9511
10:31:00,840 --> 10:31:02,840
Stony can I have some of the cake please?

9512
10:31:02,840 --> 10:31:04,840
Only because you asked nicely.

9513
10:31:04,840 --> 10:31:05,840
Here you go.

9514
10:31:05,840 --> 10:31:08,840
I don't know what you were expecting me to do.

9515
10:31:08,840 --> 10:31:10,840
I mean, unless you want to see my butt fangs

9516
10:31:10,840 --> 10:31:11,840
that's different there.

9517
10:31:11,840 --> 10:31:14,840
You can see the cake from the front.

9518
10:31:14,840 --> 10:31:15,840
There.

9519
10:31:15,840 --> 10:31:16,840
Ta-da!

9520
10:31:16,840 --> 10:31:18,840
That's why I can't show that like at all.

9521
10:31:18,840 --> 10:31:19,840
Mm-hmm.

9522
10:31:23,840 --> 10:31:25,840
All yours!

9523
10:31:27,840 --> 10:31:28,840
Holy yuck!

9524
10:31:28,840 --> 10:31:30,840
Yes, both with Mercy and I have that issue

9525
10:31:30,840 --> 10:31:32,840
so that's why we can't really do that.

9526
10:31:32,840 --> 10:31:34,840
But I'm going to get a cover up on Mercy's skirt.

9527
10:31:34,840 --> 10:31:35,840
I'm just going to get her completed

9528
10:31:35,840 --> 10:31:38,840
so she can toggle through if she's like...

9529
10:31:38,840 --> 10:31:39,840
um...

9530
10:31:40,840 --> 10:31:41,840
Yeah.

9531
10:31:49,840 --> 10:31:51,840
It's actually insane bro.

9532
10:31:51,840 --> 10:31:52,840
I got rigged out of the wazoo.

9533
10:31:52,840 --> 10:31:54,840
I got designed out of the wazoo.

9534
10:31:54,840 --> 10:31:57,840
I'm one happy cut off of this video.

9535
10:31:58,840 --> 10:32:00,840
It doesn't matter if you last two minutes.

9536
10:32:00,840 --> 10:32:03,840
I'll go as long as you want until you're really satisfied.

9537
10:32:03,840 --> 10:32:04,840
Well as I said I'm one and done

9538
10:32:04,840 --> 10:32:06,840
so you've got like two minutes of pumping

9539
10:32:06,840 --> 10:32:09,840
and then I'm like right what we are doing for take away.

9540
10:32:09,840 --> 10:32:10,840
What we...

9541
10:32:10,840 --> 10:32:12,840
Well can we watch an Elden Ring lore video

9542
10:32:12,840 --> 10:32:15,840
about the DLC once we complete it together

9543
10:32:15,840 --> 10:32:17,840
after rebinding.

9544
10:32:27,840 --> 10:32:30,840
I assume your dad named your first gen Pantyless.

9545
10:32:30,840 --> 10:32:33,840
Honestly, I'm very excited to see the short come out.

9546
10:32:34,840 --> 10:32:35,840
I need to edit it.

9547
10:32:35,840 --> 10:32:36,840
It's just...

9548
10:32:36,840 --> 10:32:37,840
It's one of the things where it's like,

9549
10:32:37,840 --> 10:32:39,840
you know what, it's on the back burner right now

9550
10:32:39,840 --> 10:32:42,840
because it's just like a small kind of hearty heart thing.

9551
10:32:43,840 --> 10:32:44,840
She's 2D?

9552
10:32:44,840 --> 10:32:45,840
It's Johnny, spin him around.

9553
10:32:45,840 --> 10:32:46,840
Okay, you win.

9554
10:32:47,840 --> 10:32:48,840
Hold on.

9555
10:32:48,840 --> 10:32:50,840
Hold on, I know how to do this.

9556
10:32:50,840 --> 10:32:54,840
I have to hold shift and then some other combination of a button.

9557
10:32:54,840 --> 10:32:55,840
I'm a real vtuber, don't worry.

9558
10:32:56,840 --> 10:32:57,840
What one is it?

9559
10:33:00,840 --> 10:33:01,840
Is it no shift?

9560
10:33:01,840 --> 10:33:04,840
Hold on, what's the one that makes me spin?

9561
10:33:04,840 --> 10:33:05,840
No.

9562
10:33:05,840 --> 10:33:06,840
Isn't there one that...

9563
10:33:07,840 --> 10:33:08,840
I did it!

9564
10:33:08,840 --> 10:33:09,840
I did it!

9565
10:33:09,840 --> 10:33:10,840
I did it!

9566
10:33:10,840 --> 10:33:11,840
I did it!

9567
10:33:11,840 --> 10:33:12,840
I'm so smart.

9568
10:33:12,840 --> 10:33:13,840
Hit him with a 3D.

9569
10:33:13,840 --> 10:33:14,840
Hit him with a 3D.

9570
10:33:14,840 --> 10:33:15,840
Hey, hey.

9571
10:33:15,840 --> 10:33:16,840
Hit him with a 3D.

9572
10:33:16,840 --> 10:33:17,840
Hey, hey.

9573
10:33:17,840 --> 10:33:18,840
Hit him with a 3D.

9574
10:33:18,840 --> 10:33:19,840
Hey.

9575
10:33:19,840 --> 10:33:21,840
Okay, that's making me motion sick.

9576
10:33:21,840 --> 10:33:23,840
Put me back down and put me straight.

9577
10:33:25,840 --> 10:33:26,840
Okay, there we go.

9578
10:33:28,840 --> 10:33:29,840
Also me.

9579
10:33:29,840 --> 10:33:32,840
Oh my gosh, why am I not maximising my wings before stream?

9580
10:33:32,840 --> 10:33:34,840
I was supposed to be like S, M, A, 6, K.

9581
10:33:35,840 --> 10:33:37,840
More mate, literally, I'm getting motion sick as well.

9582
10:33:37,840 --> 10:33:39,840
That's the wrong kind of spin.

9583
10:33:39,840 --> 10:33:40,840
We can't even see yours.

9584
10:33:40,840 --> 10:33:41,840
Oh, right.

9585
10:33:41,840 --> 10:33:42,840
Fally.

9586
10:33:47,840 --> 10:33:49,840
I didn't get rotate.

9587
10:33:49,840 --> 10:33:50,840
I got rotate so hard.

9588
10:33:50,840 --> 10:33:51,840
Oh yeah.

9589
10:33:53,840 --> 10:33:55,840
What, we are 8000?

9590
10:33:56,840 --> 10:33:57,840
How much time have we got?

9591
10:33:58,840 --> 10:33:59,840
An hour?

9592
10:33:59,840 --> 10:34:00,840
An hour?

9593
10:34:00,840 --> 10:34:03,840
How much did that fresh moment take you back?

9594
10:34:03,840 --> 10:34:04,840
An hour?

9595
10:34:05,840 --> 10:34:06,840
An hour!

9596
10:34:08,840 --> 10:34:09,840
Okay, we're done.

9597
10:34:23,840 --> 10:34:24,840
An hour.

9598
10:34:24,840 --> 10:34:26,840
She can't show back, so she made yesterday's.

9599
10:34:26,840 --> 10:34:28,840
I mean, it could be a hidden lore.

9600
10:34:28,840 --> 10:34:34,840
I really like backless pantyloons that cover up the clam.

9601
10:34:34,840 --> 10:34:36,840
But the starfish one is out.

9602
10:34:37,840 --> 10:34:46,840
It's almost over.

9603
10:34:46,840 --> 10:34:47,840
It's trying to get wonderful.

9604
10:34:47,840 --> 10:34:48,840
Well, thank you.

9605
10:34:48,840 --> 10:34:49,840
You're wonderful too.

9606
10:34:51,840 --> 10:34:52,840
We still go another hour.

9607
10:34:52,840 --> 10:34:55,840
I mean, I don't know how you guys aren't exhaustive to be honest.

9608
10:34:55,840 --> 10:34:56,840
You're like, fuck it.

9609
10:34:56,840 --> 10:34:59,840
I'll kind of listen to that accent for like one more second.

9610
10:34:59,840 --> 10:35:00,840
Like, I'm trying.

9611
10:35:01,840 --> 10:35:02,840
I'm holding it together.

9612
10:35:02,840 --> 10:35:03,840
I really am.

9613
10:35:03,840 --> 10:35:05,840
I'm holding it together.

9614
10:35:06,840 --> 10:35:07,840
Be strong, Clarence.

9615
10:35:07,840 --> 10:35:09,840
Be strong for mother.

9616
10:35:10,840 --> 10:35:12,840
You have no idea how hot that's in.

9617
10:35:12,840 --> 10:35:13,840
Bootless chap?

9618
10:35:14,840 --> 10:35:16,840
What is bootless chap?

9619
10:35:16,840 --> 10:35:18,840
Bootless chap.

9620
10:35:18,840 --> 10:35:20,840
I don't know what this is.

9621
10:35:21,840 --> 10:35:22,840
Images.

9622
10:35:23,840 --> 10:35:24,840
Bootless chap.

9623
10:35:26,840 --> 10:35:27,840
Wait, what?

9624
10:35:28,840 --> 10:35:29,840
Is that what I think?

9625
10:35:29,840 --> 10:35:30,840
What?

9626
10:35:32,840 --> 10:35:34,840
Wait, that literally is just...

9627
10:35:34,840 --> 10:35:37,840
Wait, is that what you guys are going to be wearing on the farm?

9628
10:35:39,840 --> 10:35:40,840
I'll do it.

9629
10:35:41,840 --> 10:35:42,840
I'll do it.

9630
10:35:43,840 --> 10:35:46,840
Is that literally what you guys are going to be wearing on the farm?

9631
10:35:48,840 --> 10:35:50,840
Accent makes the yapping even better.

9632
10:35:51,840 --> 10:35:52,840
Right, that's it.

9633
10:35:52,840 --> 10:35:54,840
We're going back to the lace role play.

9634
10:35:56,840 --> 10:35:58,840
I've already forgotten what I did in it.

9635
10:35:59,840 --> 10:36:01,840
I'm starting to lose it.

9636
10:36:02,840 --> 10:36:03,840
Be strong, roofling.

9637
10:36:03,840 --> 10:36:05,840
Be strong for mama.

9638
10:36:08,840 --> 10:36:10,840
Is Mercy on today?

9639
10:36:10,840 --> 10:36:12,840
I don't think she is.

9640
10:36:13,840 --> 10:36:14,840
Oh, Mercy.

9641
10:36:15,840 --> 10:36:17,840
UK, Manju...

9642
10:36:17,840 --> 10:36:19,840
Wait, you did come.

9643
10:36:19,840 --> 10:36:22,840
UK, Manju, UK, Manju, UK.

9644
10:36:23,840 --> 10:36:26,840
Mercy's 50 subscribers away from 10K.

9645
10:36:26,840 --> 10:36:28,840
I'm going to cr-

9646
10:36:28,840 --> 10:36:29,840
I'm going to custard.

9647
10:36:30,840 --> 10:36:31,840
No, Mercy.

9648
10:36:31,840 --> 10:36:33,840
I'm strong, but the question is, how long must I last?

9649
10:36:34,840 --> 10:36:37,840
You are the only non-member of the illusion team.

9650
10:36:38,840 --> 10:36:39,840
Man...

9651
10:36:40,840 --> 10:36:43,840
Shit, I'm terrible content if I'm the only one up.

9652
10:36:43,840 --> 10:36:44,840
Fuck.

9653
10:36:44,840 --> 10:36:45,840
I fucked it.

9654
10:36:46,840 --> 10:36:48,840
Oopsies, sorry.

9655
10:36:48,840 --> 10:36:49,840
My apologies.

9656
10:36:51,840 --> 10:36:52,840
I apologize.

9657
10:36:52,840 --> 10:36:53,840
I can't believe it.

9658
10:36:56,840 --> 10:36:57,840
I say aesthetics.

9659
10:36:57,840 --> 10:36:59,840
I'm so stupid.

9660
10:37:00,840 --> 10:37:02,840
I'm not tired of this grandpa.

9661
10:37:02,840 --> 10:37:04,840
Well, that's good.

9662
10:37:04,840 --> 10:37:06,840
That's darn dinkum good.

9663
10:37:06,840 --> 10:37:08,840
I don't know, something like that.

9664
10:37:10,840 --> 10:37:12,840
Can I play fair dinkum?

9665
10:37:12,840 --> 10:37:14,840
Can you guys stream snipe me in fair dinkum?

9666
10:37:14,840 --> 10:37:16,840
It's like this game about Australian farms.

9667
10:37:17,840 --> 10:37:20,840
Like, unironically, can you stream snipe in that game?

9668
10:37:21,840 --> 10:37:24,840
And I can get you guys to work and we go on adventures and stuff?

9669
10:37:27,840 --> 10:37:30,840
I have to play No Mercy for Mercy's Tinky.

9670
10:37:31,840 --> 10:37:32,840
What's No Mercy?

9671
10:37:32,840 --> 10:37:34,840
Is that a game I don't know about?

9672
10:37:35,840 --> 10:37:37,840
I told you, I'm actually a fake gamer girl.

9673
10:37:37,840 --> 10:37:38,840
Let me do it for attention.

9674
10:37:43,840 --> 10:37:46,840
Dinkum can be multiplayer, but I had a stream...

9675
10:37:46,840 --> 10:37:47,840
a stream snipe.

9676
10:37:47,840 --> 10:37:49,840
Is No Mercy a song?

9677
10:37:49,840 --> 10:37:50,840
No Mercy, song?

9678
10:37:50,840 --> 10:37:52,840
Songu desu?

9679
10:37:52,840 --> 10:37:53,840
Songu desu?

9680
10:37:53,840 --> 10:37:54,840
No Mercy.

9681
10:37:55,840 --> 10:37:57,840
Oh, the song's called No Mercy?

9682
10:38:00,840 --> 10:38:02,840
I didn't even know it was called No Mercy.

9683
10:38:03,840 --> 10:38:05,840
Shoulda picked Mercy.

9684
10:38:06,840 --> 10:38:08,840
Shoulda picked any kind of support.

9685
10:38:09,840 --> 10:38:11,840
We ended up losing.

9686
10:38:11,840 --> 10:38:13,840
It's all your fault.

9687
10:38:13,840 --> 10:38:16,840
Oops, your tears are what I live for.

9688
10:38:17,840 --> 10:38:21,840
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...

9689
10:38:22,840 --> 10:38:25,840
Mom, would you do a full cover of Mercy?

9690
10:38:26,840 --> 10:38:29,840
Shoulda picked Mercy.

9691
10:38:29,840 --> 10:38:32,840
Shoulda picked any kind of support.

9692
10:38:32,840 --> 10:38:34,840
We ended up losing.

9693
10:38:34,840 --> 10:38:38,840
It's all your fault, your tears are what I live for.

9694
10:38:39,840 --> 10:38:40,840
Maybe I'll be bashed in.

9695
10:38:40,840 --> 10:38:41,840
I'm already back.

9696
10:38:41,840 --> 10:38:42,840
Actually, let's go on that part.

9697
10:38:42,840 --> 10:38:43,840
Maybe I'll be Tracer.

9698
10:38:43,840 --> 10:38:51,840
Maybe I'll be Tracer, I'm already Tracer, what about Winston, I'm already Winston, I'll be Genji.

9699
10:38:51,840 --> 10:38:55,840
Nervomafree, fuck, I've completely forgotten the entire song.

9700
10:38:55,840 --> 10:38:59,840
Yippee!

9701
10:38:59,840 --> 10:39:03,840
I love the Scottish cover, stop, you guys shouldn't hype up, it's so bad.

9702
10:39:03,840 --> 10:39:05,840
Not the cake drops!

9703
10:39:05,840 --> 10:39:09,840
Not the cake drops in-game, don't think I don't notice the cake drop.

9704
10:39:09,840 --> 10:39:11,840
Do a quick carrier game.

9705
10:39:11,840 --> 10:39:16,840
Wait, but you'd only hear me, you wouldn't hear the copyright of it.

9706
10:39:16,840 --> 10:39:22,840
So only two minutes and then food after, I'm fine with that as long as it makes you happy, mummy.

9707
10:39:22,840 --> 10:39:29,840
Yeah, but you need to ink too, it would be weird if I inked and then you didn't go.

9708
10:39:29,840 --> 10:39:36,840
You need to be inked too, you're an acapella, fuck it, why not, I'm delirious enough to take you on.

9709
10:39:36,840 --> 10:39:43,840
Right, okay, no, no, never say, carry okay.

9710
10:39:43,840 --> 10:39:47,840
I need the carry okay version or it's over.

9711
10:39:47,840 --> 10:39:52,840
Wait, oh god, this is terrible, I don't know the words.

9712
10:39:52,840 --> 10:39:57,840
Oh, why did I mean it, there's a few guys who can hear it.

9713
10:39:57,840 --> 10:40:01,840
This, the day I have ever played with him my life.

9714
10:40:02,840 --> 10:40:06,840
You see, you know what, you don't actually get me going.

9715
10:40:06,840 --> 10:40:12,840
When it says it's a lyric video and the lyrics don't pop up until it's on the fucking fence, I'm actually gonna have a go.

9716
10:40:12,840 --> 10:40:17,840
Right, just pop it up, just pop it up so I can read.

9717
10:40:17,840 --> 10:40:22,840
Pop it up, okay, let's try it this way.

9718
10:40:22,840 --> 10:40:28,840
I'm delirious enough that I'm malleable at this point.

9719
10:40:28,840 --> 10:40:32,840
This is the worst team I have ever played within my life.

9720
10:40:32,840 --> 10:40:37,840
When we finally get on the point, everyone dies.

9721
10:40:37,840 --> 10:40:42,840
I understand that every now and then the team doesn't click.

9722
10:40:42,840 --> 10:40:47,840
I don't think I can sympathise, should have picked Mercy.

9723
10:40:47,840 --> 10:40:51,840
Should have picked any kind of support, we ended up losing.

9724
10:40:51,840 --> 10:40:57,840
It's all your fault you should learn how this game works, should have been helping.

9725
10:40:57,840 --> 10:41:01,840
I feel like Mercy so much, why don't you just marry her?

9726
10:41:01,840 --> 10:41:09,840
I don't think you can try to lecture me when you're the most useless person we have on our team.

9727
10:41:09,840 --> 10:41:14,840
Anyone rage is just as hard as you.

9728
10:41:14,840 --> 10:41:20,840
Maybe you should go back to playing Team Fortress 2, not to be Mercy.

9729
10:41:20,840 --> 10:41:24,840
I'm not gonna be any kind of support, we ended up losing.

9730
10:41:24,840 --> 10:41:29,840
Should have picked Mercy, should have been Mercy.

9731
10:41:29,840 --> 10:41:33,840
I'm not gonna be any kind of support, we ended up losing.

9732
10:41:33,840 --> 10:41:38,840
It's all your fault you should learn how this game works, should have been helping.

9733
10:41:38,840 --> 10:41:40,840
Too early, too early.

9734
10:41:40,840 --> 10:41:43,840
I'm actually playing Team Fortress right now.

9735
10:41:43,840 --> 10:41:49,840
I think the game got revived because they fixed the servers or something.

9736
10:41:49,840 --> 10:41:51,840
Okay so it's the instrumental bit.

9737
10:41:51,840 --> 10:41:53,840
It's the instrumental bit.

9738
10:41:53,840 --> 10:41:55,840
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

9739
10:41:55,840 --> 10:41:57,840
Maybe I'll be Tracer, I'm already Tracer.

9740
10:41:57,840 --> 10:41:59,840
What about Widowmaker, I'm already Widowmaker.

9741
10:41:59,840 --> 10:42:02,840
I'll be Bastion, Nerf Bastion.

9742
10:42:02,840 --> 10:42:04,840
Right so Winston, I wanna be Winston.

9743
10:42:04,840 --> 10:42:06,840
I guess I'll be Genji, I'm already Genji.

9744
10:42:06,840 --> 10:42:09,840
Then I'll be McCree, I already chose McCree.

9745
10:42:09,840 --> 10:42:11,840
What's your idea?

9746
10:42:11,840 --> 10:42:13,840
You should be, I'm not gonna be Mercy.

9747
10:42:13,840 --> 10:42:18,840
Mercy, should have been only kind of support, losing.

9748
10:42:18,840 --> 10:42:21,840
Oh they're like singing in unison right now.

9749
10:42:21,840 --> 10:42:22,840
Four.

9750
10:42:22,840 --> 10:42:25,840
Okay that's the best I got, the bots got banned.

9751
10:42:27,840 --> 10:42:30,840
Okay no more, no more.

9752
10:42:37,840 --> 10:42:39,840
You're welcome.

9753
10:42:39,840 --> 10:42:43,840
That was really hard to do like in the enunciated accent

9754
10:42:43,840 --> 10:42:47,840
because it's so easy to get tripped up on words.

9755
10:42:51,840 --> 10:42:53,840
He's not McCree anymore, he's cold.

9756
10:42:57,840 --> 10:43:00,840
I remember when the name first happened,

9757
10:43:00,840 --> 10:43:02,840
if you got caught calling McCree, everyone was like,

9758
10:43:02,840 --> 10:43:04,840
that's so disrespectful and it was like bruv,

9759
10:43:04,840 --> 10:43:06,840
I've literally known him as McCree for three years,

9760
10:43:06,840 --> 10:43:09,840
like fucking relax, like give me a second to try and, you know,

9761
10:43:09,840 --> 10:43:11,840
just call McCree a little bit different.

9762
10:43:11,840 --> 10:43:13,840
Let's do that, let's do that.

9763
10:43:13,840 --> 10:43:17,840
10 out of 10, 5 out of 10, how do you rate me so low?

9764
10:43:17,840 --> 10:43:20,840
Riefling, sit on this man.

9765
10:43:20,840 --> 10:43:23,840
Everyone calls him McCree?

9766
10:43:23,840 --> 10:43:27,840
The name's McCree, I'm your Huckleberry.

9767
10:43:27,840 --> 10:43:31,840
Not to be confused with the hit poet writer Huckleberry Fin guy,

9768
10:43:31,840 --> 10:43:35,840
that was that answer and that one was where we shocked ourselves.

9769
10:43:35,840 --> 10:43:37,840
Well, I shocked him.

9770
10:43:37,840 --> 10:43:39,840
Hi, hi, hi.

9771
10:43:39,840 --> 10:43:42,840
I make a reefling stop, you're going to make me hungry for takeaway.

9772
10:43:42,840 --> 10:43:48,840
Oh my god, but what happens if I did deserve a takeaway though?

9773
10:43:48,840 --> 10:43:51,840
Happy to see you're still streaming.

9774
10:43:51,840 --> 10:44:01,840
We're doing it, we're going to be 98 by the time I pop my clothes off.

9775
10:44:01,840 --> 10:44:07,840
Hello.

9776
10:44:07,840 --> 10:44:11,840
Poor Matt Mercer is so sick of being asked to do the high noon quote though.

9777
10:44:11,840 --> 10:44:18,840
Yeah, I remember watching an interview with Frodo or Elijah,

9778
10:44:18,840 --> 10:44:23,840
Elijah, like Elijah Woods or Elijah Woods.

9779
10:44:23,840 --> 10:44:30,840
And Sean Aston who plays Samwise.

9780
10:44:30,840 --> 10:44:36,840
And I got the impression, they were asking him about different roles

9781
10:44:36,840 --> 10:44:39,840
that they had played and different things.

9782
10:44:39,840 --> 10:44:43,840
And then it got to Lord of the Rings and they left in a bit of a cut

9783
10:44:43,840 --> 10:44:46,840
which kind of implied that they were like kind of looking at each other

9784
10:44:46,840 --> 10:44:49,840
and rolling their eyes because they've done this interview

9785
10:44:49,840 --> 10:44:52,840
like a stupendous amount of times.

9786
10:44:52,840 --> 10:44:54,840
Like they've been asked the questions over and over.

9787
10:44:54,840 --> 10:44:59,840
There's nothing that could be asked that hasn't been said before.

9788
10:44:59,840 --> 10:45:07,840
So it was just, I think it is like, don't get me wrong,

9789
10:45:07,840 --> 10:45:11,840
I'm sure people appreciate even being associated for a thing,

9790
10:45:11,840 --> 10:45:14,840
but I'm sure like you were right as well.

9791
10:45:14,840 --> 10:45:19,840
Like he gets tired of being like, say high noon, sorry, other one.

9792
10:45:19,840 --> 10:45:21,840
Or like say this, say that.

9793
10:45:21,840 --> 10:45:28,840
But then at the same time, I'm sure they equally have.

9794
10:45:28,840 --> 10:45:30,840
I've been lurking since the start of stream.

9795
10:45:30,840 --> 10:45:36,840
I'm glad I was able to spend the day off and just be rambling in the background.

9796
10:45:36,840 --> 10:45:43,840
Well, as for anyone who, Sean, are you Irish?

9797
10:45:43,840 --> 10:45:44,840
It's a 50-50.

9798
10:45:44,840 --> 10:45:45,840
What's your final answer?

9799
10:45:45,840 --> 10:45:48,840
Am I Scottish or am I Irish?

9800
10:45:48,840 --> 10:45:52,840
Your answer, if you answer wrong, you'll be timed out for 10 seconds.

9801
10:45:52,840 --> 10:45:56,840
Am I Scottish or am I Irish?

9802
10:45:56,840 --> 10:46:08,840
Am I Scottish or am I Irish?

9803
10:46:08,840 --> 10:46:12,840
Am I Scottish or am I Irish?

9804
10:46:12,840 --> 10:46:15,840
Brad didn't read the second half.

9805
10:46:15,840 --> 10:46:17,840
Brad didn't read the second half?

9806
10:46:17,840 --> 10:46:20,840
Wait, what?

9807
10:46:20,840 --> 10:46:21,840
Wait, did I miss?

9808
10:46:21,840 --> 10:46:23,840
I just timed someone out for saying Irish.

9809
10:46:23,840 --> 10:46:24,840
I'm so sorry.

9810
10:46:24,840 --> 10:46:25,840
Wait, are we not joking?

9811
10:46:25,840 --> 10:46:28,840
Do you pick the Irish pill or the Scottish pill?

9812
10:46:28,840 --> 10:46:29,840
Is this a trick question?

9813
10:46:29,840 --> 10:46:31,840
Clearly, I'm on slap on my haggis.

9814
10:46:31,840 --> 10:46:33,840
Brattie Reeflings needs time out.

9815
10:46:33,840 --> 10:46:35,840
She's Welsh, obviously.

9816
10:46:35,840 --> 10:46:39,840
I'm going to do a bit of coke and a Bacardi, I think.

9817
10:46:39,840 --> 10:46:41,840
I used to be able to do a scousa because I'm back in high school.

9818
10:46:41,840 --> 10:46:43,840
Never mind, I was making a joke.

9819
10:46:43,840 --> 10:46:44,840
Oh, right, okay.

9820
10:46:44,840 --> 10:46:45,840
See, that's the problem.

9821
10:46:45,840 --> 10:46:48,840
I'm so low IQ, you can't make jokes, okay?

9822
10:46:48,840 --> 10:46:49,840
That's how bad it is.

9823
10:46:49,840 --> 10:46:54,840
You'll never know how bad it is until it's too late, okay?

9824
10:46:55,840 --> 10:46:56,840
What?

9825
10:46:56,840 --> 10:47:00,840
She's English, obviously American.

9826
10:47:00,840 --> 10:47:05,840
Obviously, obviously Canadian with an accent like this.

9827
10:47:05,840 --> 10:47:07,840
What a Canadian.

9828
10:47:07,840 --> 10:47:09,840
Hey, Tabernac.

9829
10:47:09,840 --> 10:47:12,840
Oh, I'm sure I'm Canadian.

9830
10:47:12,840 --> 10:47:14,840
Taber, Taberdine, Aberdey.

9831
10:47:14,840 --> 10:47:19,840
Any fellow with Tabernacs?

9832
10:47:19,840 --> 10:47:21,840
I have my woman a bit smooth brain.

9833
10:47:21,840 --> 10:47:23,840
Yeah, you like the chicken breast brain?

9834
10:47:23,840 --> 10:47:26,840
I've got all the chicken breast for you, baby.

9835
10:47:26,840 --> 10:47:29,840
All up in this noggin.

9836
10:47:29,840 --> 10:47:32,840
I actually assure you.

9837
10:47:32,840 --> 10:47:34,840
Very clear Luxembourg.

9838
10:47:34,840 --> 10:47:35,840
I can't believe it.

9839
10:47:35,840 --> 10:47:39,840
I can't believe you guys actually figured out I'm Dutch all along.

9840
10:47:39,840 --> 10:47:43,840
I actually live in, please,

9841
10:47:43,840 --> 10:47:47,840
brain name one district or location in the Netherlands.

9842
10:47:47,840 --> 10:47:51,840
I actually come from Belgium

9843
10:47:51,840 --> 10:47:55,840
and this place called...

9844
10:47:55,840 --> 10:47:57,840
Shit, I was gonna make a joke.

9845
10:47:57,840 --> 10:47:58,840
Hold on.

9846
10:47:58,840 --> 10:48:01,840

10:48:01,840 --> 10:48:04,840

9848

10:48:07,840 --> 10:48:10,840
Kruzman kruzzak.

9851
10:48:10,840 --> 10:48:12,840
One person is gonna get...

10:48:13,840 --> 10:48:15,840
Ik woon in Rotterdam.

9854
10:48:15,840 --> 10:48:17,840
Ik ben in Nederlander this whole time.

9855
10:48:17,840 --> 10:48:20,840
Sorry, but if you didn't know Dutch people actually speak English.

9856
10:48:21,840 --> 10:48:23,840
Praaaat.

9857
10:48:23,840 --> 10:48:24,840

9858
10:48:24,840 --> 10:48:26,840
Yeah, Maskanche.

9859
10:48:26,840 --> 10:48:28,840
One person got that reference.

10:48:28,840 --> 10:48:30,840

9862
10:48:32,840 --> 10:48:33,840
Desonne.

9863
10:48:33,840 --> 10:48:36,840
Neither Luxembourg or Belgium are in the Netherlands.

9864
10:48:36,840 --> 10:48:38,840
I know, I have to pick.

9865
10:48:38,840 --> 10:48:40,840
But in Belgium,

9866
10:48:40,840 --> 10:48:43,840
the Sprech Netherlands

9867
10:48:43,840 --> 10:48:46,840
and Engels and

9868
10:48:46,840 --> 10:48:49,840
French and German.

9869
10:48:50,840 --> 10:48:52,840
Anything but Dutch.

9870
10:48:52,840 --> 10:48:54,840
It's the only thing I know other than the French.

9871
10:48:54,840 --> 10:48:56,840
And all I can say is like,

9872
10:48:56,840 --> 10:48:58,840
you know,

9873
10:48:58,840 --> 10:49:00,840
do you want my ass?

9874
10:49:00,840 --> 10:49:02,840
Ah, m'a cool.

9875
10:49:02,840 --> 10:49:04,840
Montpell?

9876
10:49:04,840 --> 10:49:06,840
Sorry, my accent.

9877
10:49:06,840 --> 10:49:08,840
My voice is short.

9878
10:49:08,840 --> 10:49:11,840
I can't even string a sentence together in any other lingual.

9879
10:49:11,840 --> 10:49:13,840
I'm sorry, I have disappointed you.

9880
10:49:13,840 --> 10:49:14,840
I've truly let you down.

9881
10:49:14,840 --> 10:49:16,840
The best I can do is teach you Scots.

9882
10:49:16,840 --> 10:49:18,840
To say,

9883
10:49:18,840 --> 10:49:20,840
we should

9884
10:49:20,840 --> 10:49:22,840
do jumpin' jacks in bed.

9885
10:49:22,840 --> 10:49:24,840
You say,

9886
10:49:24,840 --> 10:49:26,840
or,

9887
10:49:26,840 --> 10:49:28,840
I need my hole.

9888
10:49:28,840 --> 10:49:30,840
Basically.

9889
10:49:30,840 --> 10:49:32,840
That is a sin. I'm sorry.

9890
10:49:32,840 --> 10:49:34,840
It's not very romantic.

9891
10:49:34,840 --> 10:49:36,840
Or you say,

9892
10:49:36,840 --> 10:49:38,840
you're getting pumped.

9893
10:49:38,840 --> 10:49:40,840
And I'd be like,

9894
10:49:40,840 --> 10:49:42,840
you're flirting with me.

9895
10:49:42,840 --> 10:49:44,840
Did you hear about the giant blackout in France?

9896
10:49:44,840 --> 10:49:46,840
Oh my god, I've not.

9897
10:49:46,840 --> 10:49:48,840
Wait, is that real?

9898
10:49:48,840 --> 10:49:50,840
You told me.

9899
10:49:50,840 --> 10:49:52,840
I literally do not have time to consume

9900
10:49:52,840 --> 10:49:54,840
any current world affairs, so I know nothing.

9901
10:49:54,840 --> 10:49:56,840
France blackout?

9902
10:49:56,840 --> 10:49:58,840
Real?

9903
10:49:58,840 --> 10:50:00,840
Paris is hit by a blackout.

9904
10:50:00,840 --> 10:50:02,840
A power blackout claims social media users

9905
10:50:02,840 --> 10:50:04,840
a day after the city was battered

9906
10:50:04,840 --> 10:50:06,840
by rain

9907
10:50:06,840 --> 10:50:08,840
and trance.

9908
10:50:08,840 --> 10:50:10,840
What?

9909
10:50:10,840 --> 10:50:12,840
It says rain and trance.

9910
10:50:12,840 --> 10:50:14,840
What?

9911
10:50:14,840 --> 10:50:16,840
Paris blackout sparks chaos.

9912
10:50:16,840 --> 10:50:18,840
The Olympics

9913
10:50:18,840 --> 10:50:20,840
has under way major power out which is

9914
10:50:20,840 --> 10:50:22,840
okay, that's real.

9915
10:50:22,840 --> 10:50:24,840
We're learning about real world problems.

9916
10:50:24,840 --> 10:50:26,840
Wow.

9917
10:50:26,840 --> 10:50:28,840
The

9918
10:50:28,840 --> 10:50:30,840
Scottish language of women.

9919
10:50:30,840 --> 10:50:32,840
Exactly.

9920
10:50:32,840 --> 10:50:34,840
I thought they said,

9921
10:50:34,840 --> 10:50:36,840
can a hag use

9922
10:50:36,840 --> 10:50:38,840
your gifts?

9923
10:50:38,840 --> 10:50:40,840
You know what?

9924
10:50:40,840 --> 10:50:42,840
Don't say such silly things.

9925
10:50:42,840 --> 10:50:44,840
You frickin' frick.

9926
10:50:44,840 --> 10:50:46,840
I've been

9927
10:50:46,840 --> 10:50:48,840
I've not been slaving away, I'm literally

9928
10:50:48,840 --> 10:50:50,840
having fun. I've been slaving away for 11

9929
10:50:50,840 --> 10:50:52,840
hours here.

9930
10:50:52,840 --> 10:50:54,840
Can you get me?

9931
10:50:54,840 --> 10:50:56,840
You think I got a license in Dutch?

9932
10:50:56,840 --> 10:50:58,840
Nah, I used to.

9933
10:50:58,840 --> 10:51:00,840
So if you

9934
10:51:00,840 --> 10:51:02,840
play video games in Europe

9935
10:51:02,840 --> 10:51:04,840
you will most likely

9936
10:51:04,840 --> 10:51:06,840
make friends of a different language.

9937
10:51:06,840 --> 10:51:08,840
So that's where I picked up

9938
10:51:08,840 --> 10:51:10,840
random words and different phrases.

9939
10:51:10,840 --> 10:51:12,840
So obviously I

9940
10:51:12,840 --> 10:51:14,840
played video games.

9941
10:51:14,840 --> 10:51:16,840
So I could randomly go

9942
10:51:16,840 --> 10:51:18,840
left because the enemy

9943
10:51:18,840 --> 10:51:20,840
is left like left left left.

9944
10:51:20,840 --> 10:51:22,840
Or right.

9945
10:51:22,840 --> 10:51:24,840
I forget what right is.

9946
10:51:24,840 --> 10:51:36,840
But again in French

9947
10:51:36,840 --> 10:51:38,840
you wouldn't really go

9948
10:51:38,840 --> 10:51:43,940
more than chat but you know what I mean almost time to put into bed yeah right

9949
10:51:43,940 --> 10:51:50,540

terraria right now I'm afraid I'm not that kind of streamer I ain't built like

10014
10:59:28,660 --> 10:59:34,340
that you know I'm a fake I'm not actually playing this game this is someone else's

10015
10:59:34,340 --> 10:59:41,820
gameplay I'm so sorry to break it let's all write gibberish me Frank and Sariana

10016
10:59:41,820 --> 10:59:48,900
never stop that oven meme hurts even the same brain same brain not same brain I

10017
10:59:49,220 --> 10:59:54,020
mean we do share a brain so it's fine

10018
11:00:05,780 --> 11:00:13,700
yeah I did it Shawnee's never beaten the pre-recorded allegations I honestly

10019
11:00:13,700 --> 11:00:18,900
don't think I can pre-recorded soon what level are we at now a billion a

10020
11:00:18,900 --> 11:00:28,160
supersonic quadrillion which is a real number and two seventy three nine

10021
11:00:28,160 --> 11:00:37,060
but wait no that's not what my level is my level is 97 sorry it's 97 not to be

10022
11:00:37,060 --> 11:00:49,140
confused with the bite of 87 what do you want to say what allegations is a

10023
11:00:49,140 --> 11:00:54,340
pre-recorded law law teacher fallacy incubation

10024
11:00:54,340 --> 11:01:05,740
what are you even what is that the baby the big band version of Friday are you

10025
11:01:05,740 --> 11:01:12,060
squid me or or or or or or or mama it's been 11 hours since you started yeah do

10026
11:01:12,060 --> 11:01:16,580
you have a water bottle don't forget to check your posture and stretch okay I'll

10027
11:01:16,580 --> 11:01:19,580
go I'm a go I'm a go get a bottle of water

10028
11:01:46,580 --> 11:01:49,900
I don't have any war hey oh yeah hold on I have a cup

10029
11:01:49,900 --> 11:01:52,340
wait

10030
11:01:52,340 --> 11:02:20,340
I forgot that water comes out of peps temporarily there, okay, might have a cup of water, so

10031
11:02:21,340 --> 11:02:30,340
use it. Yeah, I wish that a funny voice would tell me a straight, I'll stretch

10032
11:02:30,340 --> 11:02:42,340
through. What did he say? Okay. Holy cannoli, so strange. Your puny mind cannot

10033
11:02:42,340 --> 11:02:49,340
comprehend the endurance of the cuttlefish and that's okay. We are small adaptive creatures

10034
11:02:49,340 --> 11:02:57,340
in the water, okay, have a glass, listen to that adaptation. I don't have any, I got water

10035
11:02:57,340 --> 11:03:05,340
in the water, okay, sleeping can. The old water tastes nicer, I don't care what anyone says,

10036
11:03:05,340 --> 11:03:13,340
I don't know why it's just as easy to drink, I said it was it. The world's tiniest but endurance

10037
11:03:13,340 --> 11:03:20,340
is massive. I thought that for my doughnathon I would do like 24 hours but I think I would

10038
11:03:20,340 --> 11:03:28,340
actually finish. I think I'd rather just become cohesive for cohesive, that means to put something

10039
11:03:28,340 --> 11:03:38,340
together. Or that composite bond. Don't drink tap water unless you have to. I think it's

10040
11:03:38,340 --> 11:03:43,340
like Melbourne, actually Scotland and like Melbourne are the locations where tap water

10041
11:03:43,340 --> 11:03:54,340
is fine. Coherent, not possible. Water tier list, Fiji has got it. Oh my god. I saw if

10042
11:03:54,340 --> 11:03:59,340
you walk up Mount Fiji you can get stamps on a stick and I wanted to do that because

10043
11:03:59,340 --> 11:04:04,340
that was kind of cool. I was watching VTuber do 24 hours of karaoke, how is there even

10044
11:04:04,340 --> 11:04:16,340
a voice at the end? She's confusing, coherent, cohesive and covalent bond. Yeah, any covalent

10045
11:04:16,340 --> 11:04:24,340
bond. I'm doing it, okay we're in the 7000, this is what I wanted. I got the end. It's

10046
11:04:24,340 --> 11:04:29,340
like top 10 quality, damn straight it is. If you walk up Mount Fiji you find all the

10047
11:04:29,340 --> 11:04:38,340
bottles of water they sell. Wait isn't, okay that's a brand, 24 hour winemaking, no. I

10048
11:04:38,340 --> 11:04:46,340
definitely start losing like brain power at a certain point in stream and I've definitely

10049
11:04:46,340 --> 11:04:51,340
hit it right now and I can tell I've hit it and food wouldn't fix it, like I need to

10050
11:04:52,340 --> 11:05:03,340
sleep. Super tasty sleep, super spicy sleep. Carrot and coriander, super power, fruton,

10051
11:05:03,340 --> 11:05:10,340
fruton and a munchie bowl, something like that. You're going for 2s the billion, wait

10052
11:05:10,340 --> 11:05:19,340
wait, why would I go for 200 million XP? Is that the record or something? Why would anyone

10053
11:05:19,340 --> 11:05:28,340
do 200 million XP if it's like 13 million to get max? Imagine paying for bottled water.

10054
11:05:28,340 --> 11:05:32,340
Look, I'll take my hydration where I can get it, if it beats the neon pee allegations

10055
11:05:32,340 --> 11:05:43,340
I'll take it. Sleep, upload pregnant videos and have another stream of them waking up.

10056
11:05:43,340 --> 11:05:49,340
Honestly, we're playing blinks and I'm like oh my god, I couldn't even get past the second

10057
11:05:49,340 --> 11:05:57,340
level as a child. I am pa re aying, I know what I'm doing. If not, we're going to be

10058
11:05:57,340 --> 11:06:04,340
watching a tutorial live at each level and then copy what the person does. 200 millions

10059
11:06:04,340 --> 11:06:11,340
XP cap, well congrats to those who got 200 million, I ain't doin' 200 million.

10060
11:06:11,340 --> 11:06:20,340
Can ASMRs fall asleep to their own ASMR? I like sleep aid stuff, but I'm sure there

10061
11:06:20,340 --> 11:06:27,340
is people who do, but for me personally, I watch gameplay of games and stuff. Love the

10062
11:06:27,340 --> 11:06:34,340
Blinks Centre, and before blinks is what Gen 2's unconfirmed OSU is about. About unconfirmed,

10063
11:06:34,340 --> 11:06:43,340
I mean Gen 2's unconfirmed. I know, I'm shocking, but it's actually not confirmed.

10064
11:06:43,340 --> 11:06:51,340
We're at 7.9, literally this number is going down. What kind of game is blinks? Saw it on

10065
11:06:51,340 --> 11:07:00,340
Game Pass, but also, right, so one, you're a cat, and then you've got a hoover on ya,

10066
11:07:00,340 --> 11:07:10,340
and you can rewind time, but you have to pick up gems in order to access what you can do.

10067
11:07:10,340 --> 11:07:19,340
You can pause time, you can rewind it, you can make it go slow and stuff. It's really weird.

10068
11:07:19,340 --> 11:07:24,340
Also, the ASMR train you guys planned, the other day was too good. Oh, I'm so glad. I'm

10069
11:07:24,340 --> 11:07:30,340
gonna ask the girls if we can do it once a month. I think it went really well. I liked it.

10070
11:07:30,340 --> 11:07:37,340
Okay, I enjoyed. Well, good night. Rest well, those who need to sleep. I'll join you in sleep

10071
11:07:37,340 --> 11:07:42,340
land very shortly. I'll haunt you in your dreams. I'll be like, you didn't watch until

10072
11:07:42,340 --> 11:07:47,340
the end of my stream. Did you, ya bam? No, I'm not gonna do that. I promise I'm not hauntin'

10073
11:07:48,340 --> 11:07:53,340
I am just as tired as you. Stop clicking that. That's the third time I've done it.

10074
11:07:53,340 --> 11:07:59,340
Drop it. Wait, I remember the game. Because of the hidden decimal, it is recorded in the

10075
11:07:59,340 --> 11:08:06,340
game as to which is just under the data limit. Okay. A cat with a hoover on it seems like

10076
11:08:06,340 --> 11:08:12,340
a terrifying existence. Johnny's already invaded my dreams. Oh my god, I'm the invader in Elden

10077
11:08:12,340 --> 11:08:22,340
Reign. But instead, it's your dream. I wish you would haunt my dreams instead of the women

10078
11:08:22,340 --> 11:08:26,340
who's currently hauntin' them. Oh, are you like actually getting nightmares? It's been

10079
11:08:26,340 --> 11:08:32,340
fun. I truly enjoyed the stream. I'll see you again, Johnny. See you tomorrow. Rest well,

10080
11:08:32,340 --> 11:08:39,340
those who need to rest. We play in blanks. Yay. And there's gonna be Prego ASMR up this

10081
11:08:39,340 --> 11:08:47,340
time tomorrow. Yeah, you have forced to listen to my Prego belly. I'll be like, ooh, I'm

10082
11:08:47,340 --> 11:08:54,340
so full and pregnant. I don't, I'm sorry. I love gettin' groomed by my favourite shumer.

10083
11:08:54,340 --> 11:08:59,340
Thank you. You're more than welcome. It's been an absolute pleasure to fully groom you.

10084
11:09:00,340 --> 11:09:10,340
Oh, my fellow Americans. Hi, Momay. Hi, B-Sling. You can haunt my dreams any time.

10085
11:09:14,340 --> 11:09:21,340
It's funny seeing people say goodnight while I just woke up. It's about to be four, no,

10086
11:09:21,340 --> 11:09:30,340
it's three-sixteen for me in the afternoon. I go to sleep with your girls at ASMR, so

10087
11:09:30,340 --> 11:09:35,340
I already have your guys' voices in my head. And soon you'll get a Scottish accent. Soon

10088
11:09:35,340 --> 11:09:41,340
you'll get a Scottish accent. There's one riflin' that I corrupted in the workplace

10089
11:09:41,340 --> 11:09:46,340
and he went, I, or something. And everyone was like, huh? And he's like, oh, sorry, I've

10090
11:09:46,340 --> 11:09:56,340
got a Scottish accent. Okay. That was an odd combination. Please don't do that again,

10091
11:09:56,340 --> 11:10:02,340
body. I think my body just took a fucking screenshot. That was a sneeze. A hiccup and

10092
11:10:02,340 --> 11:10:08,340
a fucking burp all in one. What? It's been a while since I've popped by one of your

10093
11:10:08,340 --> 11:10:12,340
dreams. Hi, hi. Unfortunately, you've popped in on the most boring one of all. I'm currently

10094
11:10:12,340 --> 11:10:18,340
delirious after streaming 11 hours of RuneScape. My voice is sore because I've been talking

10095
11:10:18,340 --> 11:10:26,340
for 11 hours and the RuneScape gameplay is this. It's removing water and grapes from

10096
11:10:26,340 --> 11:10:33,340
my inventory, then putting it back in the bank to ferment for XP. Sorry. I look forward

10097
11:10:33,340 --> 11:10:40,340
to more scrawny streams. Oh, yeah. I stream every single day because I'm addicted. Oh, I

10098
11:10:40,340 --> 11:10:45,340
can make the collage soon of all my streams this month. I wonder, it's probably going to

10099
11:10:45,340 --> 11:10:49,340
look a little worse because I couldn't do as much membership streams this month. Sorry,

10100
11:10:49,340 --> 11:10:55,340
scrawny, step a little bit. You're allowed to sleep. I'm not going to be mad. You're

10101
11:10:55,340 --> 11:11:03,340
allowed to sleep. I'm doing good. We're going to, we have a bit of a VOD monkaS. It's coming,

10102
11:11:03,340 --> 11:11:09,340
but I can't see the actual time because my OBS broke and it says I've been streaming for

10103
11:11:09,340 --> 11:11:15,340
six hours on my end because my OBS farted one time and it shouldn't have farted. Like,

10104
11:11:15,340 --> 11:11:19,340
like OBS, honestly, I don't know why you thought that was appropriate to do that to me. Like,

10105
11:11:19,340 --> 11:11:26,340
I thought it was the shit, but it's not even the fart. Like, it's just, you still stream

10106
11:11:26,340 --> 11:11:33,340
every day, so it will be peak. I hope so. It's peak gameplay though. I'm totally not

10107
11:11:33,340 --> 11:11:39,340
biased with an unholy amount of, or Brian, totally not biased with an unholy amount of

10108
11:11:39,340 --> 11:11:48,340
hours in RS. I'm glad you like the, the peak gameplay arcane ghosts. I mean, it's just a

10109
11:11:48,340 --> 11:11:54,340
riveting. What more could you possibly ask for truly? What more could you need? What more could you need?

10110
11:11:54,340 --> 11:12:00,340
Thank you, Brian for adding to that as well. It helps me so much that I don't have to use my brain.

10111
11:12:00,340 --> 11:12:06,340
Thank you for the super care. Um, I don't know if we should do fletching for the heck of it at

10112
11:12:06,340 --> 11:12:12,340
all. What? I have like 51k winds. I just thought that in the corner of my eye. Great. We have five more

10113
11:12:12,340 --> 11:12:17,340
hours to go. Chatting stream with RuneScape in the back. Literally, it's just yapping. I just, I have a

10114
11:12:17,340 --> 11:12:25,340
yapped nonstop. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Mods. Five more hours to go until I'm done.

10115
11:12:25,340 --> 11:12:33,340
Look at that. 51 jugs of wine. Just a wee bit. Hi. You're the reason I'm attracted to

10116
11:12:33,340 --> 11:12:44,340
Scottish accents now. Yay! Thank you. Oh my God. Thank you, Jay. You like it? Oh, I'm

10117
11:12:44,340 --> 11:12:53,340
scrawny. And my accent's getting you a boner right now. Yeah, you like that? Yeah. Absolutely

10118
11:12:53,340 --> 11:13:00,340
God. Are you just popping and locking in your seat right now? You are locked in. That guy, me,

10119
11:13:00,340 --> 11:13:08,340
serving up hot, stringy appachinos. Oh, that's so good. That guy, me. I'll get a good sleep. Yeah,

10120
11:13:08,340 --> 11:13:11,340
I'll get a good sleep after this. Hello, Momay. I just woke up. I'm going to look at

10121
11:13:11,340 --> 11:13:21,340
his body. He's still streaming. Yeah. It worked. It worked. It worked. We're at 7.6. We might

10122
11:13:21,340 --> 11:13:27,340
be able to get to 6. I'm not sure. I'm going to be honest. I'm not locked in. I'm locked out

10123
11:13:27,340 --> 11:13:33,340
if anything. My brain is now outside my skull at this point in time, in all honesty. She's

10124
11:13:33,340 --> 11:13:40,340
too powerful. Actually, I'm as well. I'll see if there's any more marshmallow. No, there's

10125
11:13:40,340 --> 11:13:46,340
no more marshmallows. You've exerted all questions. I'm too much of an open book that

10126
11:13:46,340 --> 11:13:51,340
there's no more questions to be asked. I'm your name's scrawny cuttles. I'll be giving

10127
11:13:51,340 --> 11:13:59,340
Lance a hard one because of my accent. Actually, your poor lassie seems hilarious. scrawny, the

10128
11:13:59,340 --> 11:14:16,340
same. Watch it. It's 3.21 PM, sir. Thank you. And I'm going to sleep. And I take my whiskey.

10129
11:14:16,340 --> 11:14:23,340
Just don't push yourself too much. She's playing in third person at me. I've seen people do

10130
11:14:23,340 --> 11:14:27,340
accounts of that when they're like, oh, when I'm in surgery, I see myself in third person.

10131
11:14:27,340 --> 11:14:36,340
I saw myself on the operating table. It's like a phenomenon that your brain needs to

10132
11:14:36,340 --> 11:14:42,340
imagine a third perspective in order to protect yourself from the danger it perceives. It can

10133
11:14:42,340 --> 11:14:46,340
inject that. You can see people working around you and your brain puts the rest together.

10134
11:14:46,340 --> 11:14:55,340
We're just actually a smart little thing trying to keep you alive, honestly. Some of this

10135
11:14:55,340 --> 11:15:04,340
stuff needs to be stand back and pure awe of just everything. You should make a reverse

10136
11:15:04,340 --> 11:15:13,340
comfort ASMR. Mimosa from Yume Plus did something like that. Oh wait, wait, reverse comfort isn't

10137
11:15:13,340 --> 11:15:21,340
you comfort me. I'm thinking of reverse ASMR where I randomly scream in the mic. I don't

10138
11:15:21,340 --> 11:15:30,340
really do that. You're still screaming. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Or good

10139
11:15:30,340 --> 11:15:39,340
morning. Nah, I guess that I'm both G's. I've got a guy on it. Good morning, Kavanya.

10140
11:15:39,340 --> 11:15:49,340
Wow. The power of I heard my name. That's a reverse. Do you think they simply see it

10141
11:15:49,340 --> 11:15:54,340
in third person or it's like an isometric view? I don't even know what isometric means.

10142
11:15:54,340 --> 11:16:03,340
I'm sorry. My brain doesn't have that pathway. What is isometric mean? Isometric. Isometric.

10143
11:16:03,340 --> 11:16:09,340
All the Europeans are wake up. Okay, now let's say good morning in all the European countries.

10144
11:16:09,340 --> 11:16:29,340
Okay, first things first. Bonjour. Petit de Genère. I don't know. Isometric is top down.

10145
11:16:30,340 --> 11:16:42,340
Like the tabletops in there. No, that's not what that means. I got to immediately coax

10146
11:16:42,340 --> 11:16:54,340
it up. Literally. Good morning. Bonjour. It's bonjour. It's just like aloe. I think it can

10147
11:16:54,340 --> 11:17:01,340
be used in morning context. Say good in French. You say bon. And then say morning. You say

10148
11:17:01,340 --> 11:17:09,340
morning. Forgotten. It's 6am. I'm going to have to call it. Rest well. Sleep tight. Go

10149
11:17:09,340 --> 11:17:16,340
and let the bed bugs. Bye. Not that any bed bugs are biting. If anything, I'm the little

10150
11:17:16,340 --> 11:17:23,340
bed bug. Oh my God. Remember in the B movie where the lawyers like, are you shagging this

10151
11:17:23,340 --> 11:17:31,340
B in the B movie? Is that you've got a little bed bug? Is that objection your honour? I shagged

10152
11:17:31,340 --> 11:17:37,340
this woman. Why was she wanting to shag the B? What's going on? Does that need to be concerned?

10153
11:17:37,340 --> 11:17:48,340
That ain't worry. What a perplexing movie. I just remember at the end of it, it goes,

10154
11:17:48,340 --> 11:17:58,340
here comes the sun. Here comes the sun. And I'll say, and then I can't remember the rest.

10155
11:17:59,340 --> 11:18:06,340
Still think it's ridiculous she left her husband for a B? Like, oh, and the husband's

10156
11:18:06,340 --> 11:18:14,340
crunk from Emperor's New Groove. It's so surreal. And after that lawyer was stung, he had a baby

10157
11:18:14,340 --> 11:18:23,340
assistant, assisting walker. Rest well. Sleep tight. Stronia's a bed bug isn't biting, but

10158
11:18:23,340 --> 11:18:32,340
she's definitely stuck it. Oh my God. I'll be making your toes curl. My job as a baby.

10159
11:18:32,340 --> 11:18:38,340
She was after that stinger. 30 more minutes until nuke. Okay, thank you for keeping me

10160
11:18:38,340 --> 11:18:44,340
right, because I am not going to... A bed bug for Gen 3. You think I'm going to have

10161
11:18:44,340 --> 11:18:52,340
an insect? You think the odds of me having an insect are that high? The only insect

10162
11:18:52,340 --> 11:19:00,340
I have is insect seeds, which kills them, which is actually not very nice. I don't know

10163
11:19:00,340 --> 11:19:07,340
if it's been asked, but do you sleep with pajamas? No, I can't wear anything. Which has

10164
11:19:07,340 --> 11:19:14,340
led to Gimli fucking biting my ass to wake me up when I keep sleeping in too long. She'll

10165
11:19:14,340 --> 11:19:20,340
ask for food via biting on my butt cheek, and it's really annoying. She hasn't stopped.

10166
11:19:20,340 --> 11:19:28,340
It's really weird. She purposely lifts the cover up with her face and then bites my cheek.

10167
11:19:28,340 --> 11:19:33,340
It's ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous. Oh my voice is cracking. Holy shit, can you

10168
11:19:33,340 --> 11:19:40,340
hear that voice crack? Oh my God. I have... Oh no, have I broke my voice? I hope not.

10169
11:19:40,340 --> 11:19:59,340
I need to record that fucking... Oh, I think I'm... Okay, I think we're back. I think we're

10170
11:19:59,340 --> 11:20:06,340
back. I think we're back. I think it's okay. I definitely need some ink supply. I'm just

10171
11:20:06,340 --> 11:20:13,340
telling you now, okay, refling, I need some ink to soothe my throat. I do. I do, I do,

10172
11:20:13,340 --> 11:20:19,340
I do. The voice has yapped enough, truly. We're getting there, we're getting there.

10173
11:20:19,340 --> 11:20:26,340
But we're made. I'll check Marshmallow in a minute just to make sure I've not missed

10174
11:20:26,340 --> 11:20:34,340
anything. You should probably stop once you go under 70. Oh, but if I keep pushing...

10175
11:20:34,340 --> 11:20:43,340
Ah, just pushing. Pushing real good. Ah, just pushing. Ink in the tea right now, do it.

10176
11:20:43,340 --> 11:20:52,340
Night night, rest well. Thank you for hanging. Bonne nuit. Bienvenue. Bon voyage.

10177
11:20:53,340 --> 11:20:56,340
Sí, señor.

10178
11:21:07,340 --> 11:21:14,340
30 minutes and then we're at the mark. We only have time to go under 60, but I'll just

10179
11:21:14,340 --> 11:21:20,340
I'm better to do more. Keep voice crack, I hope it recovers for all the other projects,

10180
11:21:20,340 --> 11:21:26,340
honestly. It'll be fine. I just shut up. Okay, I don't really talk, well, I mean, I spoke

10181
11:21:26,340 --> 11:21:33,340
to Sin the other day, if that counts as talking. I mean, yeah. That kind of has to put Sin.

10182
11:21:33,340 --> 11:21:36,340
I can't, but it's the more you've got.

10183
11:21:37,340 --> 11:21:46,340
You would like to know where our CASA is. Spanish lessons from a Scottish one. And to say

10184
11:21:46,340 --> 11:21:55,340
my house, my home is your home. You say, mi CASA, ay, tú CASA. Yeah, you're a

10185
11:21:55,340 --> 11:22:00,340
Scottish Spanish teacher. Mami, please don't leave. Can we start a part two? I'm so sorry,

10186
11:22:00,340 --> 11:22:07,340
I would do it if I could. I don't feel very well. I'm a bit delirious. I'm sad. It's okay.

10187
11:22:07,340 --> 11:22:13,340
We'll do a finishing up stream and we'll finish all of this, I promise. Actually, is there

10188
11:22:13,340 --> 11:22:22,340
even anyone we can redirect him to? I don't think so. We may casually redirect him and

10189
11:22:22,340 --> 11:22:27,340
be like, yeah, I just did a 12-hour stream. But I love when the streamer's like, oh,

10190
11:22:27,340 --> 11:22:32,340
but yeah, that's it. And I'm like, oh, just 12 hours of room. Yeah, that's pretty good.

10191
11:22:35,340 --> 11:22:40,340
Yeah, no, I'm just chilling. We're just hanging out at the reef. I'm not going to

10192
11:22:40,340 --> 11:22:51,340
have a TV on. What the fuck is the bot in the corporation? Well, let's say, instead of

10193
11:22:51,340 --> 11:22:58,340
saying sayonara, haha, you're saying hi at the reef lane. Get up. I am so funny. Please

10194
11:22:58,340 --> 11:23:03,340
clap. Don't clap. That was awful. Mami, you have 50 minutes until the bad stuff starts

10195
11:23:03,340 --> 11:23:12,340
up. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. Yeah.

10196
11:23:13,340 --> 11:23:23,340
Okay, we're at 7.3. We're at 7.3. Come on, come on. You wish to trade with me. What do

10197
11:23:23,340 --> 11:23:28,340
you wish to offer me, dear reef lane? If it's a crusty sock, you're done for. If I accept

10198
11:23:28,340 --> 11:23:36,340
this trade and it's a crusty sock, you're done for. That was an outfit. Are you dressing

10199
11:23:36,340 --> 11:23:47,340
me up? You're dressing me up. I use it. Sanguishly, I mean, I mean, I do be cooking in the kitchen.

10200
11:23:47,340 --> 11:23:54,340
You want some? I do be cooking in the kitchen. I mean, shit, look at the drip. Look at the

10201
11:23:54,340 --> 11:24:03,340
drip. Look at them pixels. Look at them polygons. God damn, this game is stunning. Look at the

10202
11:24:03,340 --> 11:24:08,340
drip. Right, pop that stuff on. Thank you for pimping me out. Look at the drip in those

10203
11:24:08,340 --> 11:24:16,340
polygons. You can see literally every polygon is fantastic. Truly, you can admire every little

10204
11:24:16,340 --> 11:24:22,340
triangle that went into this game. It's gorgeous. Housewife strongy, is that what it's supposed

10205
11:24:22,340 --> 11:24:28,340
to be? Is that what it's supposed to be? That's actually what it's meant. Okay, let me take

10206
11:24:28,340 --> 11:24:35,340
Marshmallow. Sunny, I love you all the way to the moon and back. Did you know if you, I love you to

10207
11:24:35,340 --> 11:24:40,340
refling, did you know if you stretch out the DNA sequence, like if you did it like bit by

10208
11:24:40,340 --> 11:24:45,340
bit, it would reach the moon and back. That's what it should be like. Okay, the problem with getting

10209
11:24:45,340 --> 11:24:50,340
ink in the throat is you first have to ravage it before getting the treat. No, you need to be

10210
11:24:50,340 --> 11:24:58,340
nice to me. Don't be mean. I need medicine. You have to be nice to me if I need it for

10211
11:24:58,340 --> 11:25:07,340
medicinal purposes. Okay? That's, that's, yeah. Please continue your marination and get some

10212
11:25:08,340 --> 11:25:13,340
to this. Oh, my marination because I stank. Okay.

10213
11:25:20,340 --> 11:25:22,340
Oh wait, I don't think I have to read this one out loud.

10214
11:25:27,340 --> 11:25:33,340
Aw. I want to hear your reference opinion on it since I can't see. Oh, you want me to read

10215
11:25:33,340 --> 11:25:37,340
it out loud? Wait, hold on. I need to read this one. I actually need to use my brain

10216
11:25:37,340 --> 11:25:46,340
to listen. Hold on. Okay, I'm here. I want to hear your and the reason's opinion on this

10217
11:25:46,340 --> 11:25:51,340
since I can't see it. I don't know. Is it? Okay, hold on. Okay, okay. I'm sorry about

10218
11:25:51,340 --> 11:25:55,340
this post, right? Don't be. Don't be. You're just telling it how it is. But I feel like I

10219
11:25:55,340 --> 11:25:59,340
have no other place to see it. I want to send this now while I still have the courage. I am

10220
11:25:59,340 --> 11:26:05,340
scared of expressing myself, whether I have, it was met with ridiculing humiliation, whether

10221
11:26:05,340 --> 11:26:09,340
it be in real life or online. I was especially bad in secondary school when I was bullied

10222
11:26:09,340 --> 11:26:13,340
for factors I couldn't control such as my height or even just as my name. And it made

10223
11:26:13,340 --> 11:26:17,340
me super insecure. I have trouble communicating with people and it has unfortunately got more

10224
11:26:17,340 --> 11:26:23,340
astute to these experiences. And I have a dislike of talking to people. However, Vealer

10225
11:26:23,340 --> 11:26:31,340
has changed this. I've never seen a community so accepting of others regardless of their

10226
11:26:31,340 --> 11:26:37,340
interest. You've inspired me to express myself again. I want to hear your and the reason's

10227
11:26:37,340 --> 11:26:42,340
opinions on this since I can't see everything I want to see in one Mario. I want to send

10228
11:26:42,340 --> 11:26:47,340
some more. Is it wrong for me to do this? Because I want to send, no, you can see what

10229
11:26:47,340 --> 11:26:53,340
you want in my marshmallows. If you need to use it as an outlet, I honestly don't mind

10230
11:26:53,340 --> 11:26:59,340
at all. Get it out. It's better to see what's going on than to keep it inside. If you keep

10231
11:26:59,340 --> 11:27:05,340
that shit inside, that won't fuck you up. I'm being so serious. I literally had a meltdown

10232
11:27:05,340 --> 11:27:10,340
on a membership stream and then surprise, surprise, the next day I came online and everything

10233
11:27:10,340 --> 11:27:16,340
was fine. You're literally allowed to feel bad. You're literally allowed to feel your

10234
11:27:16,340 --> 11:27:22,340
emotions. You're literally allowed to have a bad, you don't have to pretend. This isn't

10235
11:27:22,340 --> 11:27:26,340
a workplace where it's like, how are you? And you go, yeah, I'm fine. And then deep down

10236
11:27:26,340 --> 11:27:31,340
inside, you're dying. No, that's not how it works here. And I'm sure all the reflins

10237
11:27:31,340 --> 11:27:35,340
agree with me. That's not how it works here. How are you? And then you tell us how you

10238
11:27:35,340 --> 11:27:42,340
actually are. That's how it is. You can be shy stuff. You can be just in the trenches.

10239
11:27:42,340 --> 11:27:45,340
If you want to use my marshmallows for that, you are more than welcome to go ahead and you

10240
11:27:45,340 --> 11:27:51,340
have full permission. You and any other refling for that matter, okay? And even for a lurker,

10241
11:27:51,340 --> 11:27:56,340
if you're like, shit, I ain't calling myself a reflin. Man, it's a cute name, okay? One,

10242
11:27:56,340 --> 11:28:01,340
it's a cute name. Two, fine. Everyone is allowed their opinions. If it's wrong, but...

10243
11:28:01,340 --> 11:28:06,340
Whoa, where am I going? Damn. I just really wanted to admire the drip, apparently. Oh,

10244
11:28:06,340 --> 11:28:13,340
you got lions on your back. I put myself in front of the bank. Oh, and I'm interacting

10245
11:28:13,340 --> 11:28:17,340
with the bank. You have to start somewhere. Ten minutes before noon. Oh, no, she can't

10246
11:28:17,340 --> 11:28:23,340
hear us. Okay, okay, okay. Someone says, boo. Oh, I'm scared. I'm baritized. Can we brush

10247
11:28:23,340 --> 11:28:32,340
our teeth together? Fuck, no. My toothbrush. It's in disarray. Mommy, what's your opinion

10248
11:28:32,340 --> 11:28:40,340
on facial hair? My opinion? It doesn't bother me. Have you been like a preference? I don't

10249
11:28:40,340 --> 11:28:46,340
really have preferences like that. I don't like preferences like, please be fat.

10250
11:28:52,340 --> 11:28:58,340
Nuke incoming. Dany ago? Wait, Dany to go? Duh, actually, I need to go. Is that going

10251
11:28:58,340 --> 11:29:07,340
to be the last thing I say before I go? Dany to go? Dany to go? Is it nuke time? Is it

10252
11:29:07,340 --> 11:29:16,340
nuke time? Don't force feed me. You need to stop. You have 15 minutes. You've got 20

10253
11:29:16,340 --> 11:29:20,340
minutes. Wait, why are you telling me to go? You're scaring me. I don't know if the

10254
11:29:20,340 --> 11:29:27,340
boat's popped or not. Yes, nuke town. It's been 1130. Okay. Okay, don't do that. You're

10255
11:29:27,340 --> 11:29:33,340
scaring me, really? Mom, why should I? Yeah, I don't really have an opinion, to be honest.

10256
11:29:34,340 --> 11:29:39,340
Strongie, the world of Pandora is so beautiful. The animals in the blue cat peep people. Also,

10257
11:29:39,340 --> 11:29:44,340
the wonder of the nature is perfect for the humans and RDA to harvest and exploit. Freaking

10258
11:29:44,340 --> 11:29:50,340
manatee, RDA, RDA. No, Strongie, I just want to say no, no, no, no. You're not getting any

10259
11:29:50,340 --> 11:29:57,340
Scottish age. I'm too tired to R wordy, okay? Mommy's too tired to R wordy. I'm not even

10260
11:29:57,340 --> 11:30:02,340
kidding today. I don't know why it didn't show up, but I was offering a Shanie and

10261
11:30:02,340 --> 11:30:17,340
Pokemon. Oh, thank you. I've not played New World's Pokemon. We know if you start

10262
11:30:17,340 --> 11:30:25,340
yapping again, you won't stop and then I'll be in yet. No, this cannot be. No, no, no,

10263
11:30:25,340 --> 11:30:34,340
no. Base refilling. You start stream about 10 minutes late today. I was 10 minutes late?

10264
11:30:34,340 --> 11:30:38,340
No brushing, she hates us. No, no, no, I'll do it to brush it. I can't do it. No, I don't

10265
11:30:38,340 --> 11:30:43,340
have time. I don't have time to go and get my two boys in the government. But I do it

10266
11:30:43,340 --> 11:30:52,340
before Ben. Imagine you just need to be fat and then end up, literally, literally. I thought

10267
11:30:52,340 --> 11:30:58,340
I thought that was what I was going to be. Okay, let's check the bank for how much water

10268
11:30:58,340 --> 11:31:07,340
and how much, oh my God, it's ruined. Wait, why are you, who's money dropping? Who's flexing

10269
11:31:07,340 --> 11:31:14,340
their fat stacks randomly? Just drop it. Brev, look at, look, go refilling. I'm going to take

10270
11:31:14,340 --> 11:31:19,340
this stack. I'm going to keep it a buck 50, okay? I'm going to yank real, like, I'm going

10271
11:31:19,340 --> 11:31:26,340
to keep it a buck 50. Stronning has terminally affing disease, honestly. Refilling tried to

10272
11:31:26,340 --> 11:31:33,340
rifle Stronning, but she's too tight. I literally am sorry, but I can't do it. I don't have the

10273
11:31:33,340 --> 11:31:37,340
anger in me to take it out on you. It just means we've got to brush what we see for it.

10274
11:31:37,340 --> 11:31:43,340
Oh, we just did that for me. That was just super easy. I'm just like, you keep my, my

10275
11:31:43,340 --> 11:31:51,340
key. I'm going to keep it a stack. Oh, I love terminology. I love that term. I'll keep it a

10276
11:31:51,340 --> 11:31:58,340
buck 50. What does that mean? What does I will keep it $1.50 mean? I'll keep it a buck

10277
11:31:58,340 --> 11:32:07,340
50. I'll keep it $1.50. What does that mean? What does that translate to? I'll keep it

10278
11:32:07,340 --> 11:32:17,340
$150. It means the money don't lie. It's a reference to Costco keeping their hot dog combo

10279
11:32:17,340 --> 11:32:26,340
at $1.50. No! I failed you. I failed in my American lore. Are you joking me? I normally

10280
11:32:26,340 --> 11:32:31,340
know all American lore. I don't. I lied. Are you kidding me right now? I want to give

10281
11:32:31,340 --> 11:32:36,340
my peace on that. I want to give my peace on that because I too am pretty lonely, but

10282
11:32:36,340 --> 11:32:40,340
you guys are my reefling brothers and Stronning brought us together and

10283
11:32:40,340 --> 11:32:49,340
I'm grateful. So you mean we're starting an army? Maybe a social uprising? Perhaps against

10284
11:32:49,340 --> 11:32:54,340
the high table. Thank you, Revive, for the super chat. I'm glad we can all keep each

10285
11:32:54,340 --> 11:32:59,340
other company. This world can get lonely if you don't reach out. But when you do

10286
11:32:59,340 --> 11:33:03,340
reach out, you'll notice that people all reach out with their hands too when

10287
11:33:03,340 --> 11:33:08,340
grab you. And you just got to sometimes do the... You gotta get through the awkward

10288
11:33:08,340 --> 11:33:14,340
bit where you gotta reach out. And yes, awkward but hey, that's human. Thank you,

10289
11:33:14,340 --> 11:33:23,340
Arcane Ghost. Now wait a minute. I've said your name today. How did you do that twice?

10290
11:33:23,340 --> 11:33:29,340
I don't know. Thank you for coming a member. Our brothers in the reef today,

10291
11:33:29,340 --> 11:33:35,340
Unity, would be lore-wise a wonderful bit. Who is the table? Why does everyone say

10292
11:33:35,340 --> 11:33:41,340
hi to them? Honestly, that's what I need the FBI agents to ask when they show up

10293
11:33:41,340 --> 11:33:49,340
at my door. The Cosco Fender threatened to perish the CEO if he raised the price

10294
11:33:49,340 --> 11:33:55,340
of the hotel combo. They're duplicating. Someone made an art about the Reefling Army

10295
11:33:55,340 --> 11:34:01,340
too. Wasn't that not the boat one of you guys in the background? Why did I not see

10296
11:34:01,340 --> 11:34:11,340
it? Can I not see it? Glory to Strony here. Glory to Villalor. Here, here.

10297
11:34:11,340 --> 11:34:18,340
Nastrovia. Clink. Oh wait, I have a cup that I can make a clink noise with. Glory to

10298
11:34:18,340 --> 11:34:29,340
Villalor. Nastrovia. Yay! Abranovich or something, I don't know. Okay, we almost made

10299
11:34:29,340 --> 11:34:42,340
it. The Cosco Hot Dog combo. I'ma keep it a buck, 50. Amen. Don't risk the vodka.

10300
11:34:42,340 --> 11:34:48,340
Is it time for me to go? Glory to Vsucki. Look, it was a good cost. The Suckibish

10301
11:34:48,340 --> 11:34:54,340
were running amok and they're contaminating the blood of other people. Look, it would

10302
11:34:54,340 --> 11:35:04,340
be a good cheesy anime, okay? Cool, but strong. A little over 60 minutes left, I

10303
11:35:04,340 --> 11:35:10,340
really hate pee. I'll fire 1000 CEOs before I let this company raise the price of a hot

10304
11:35:10,340 --> 11:35:20,340
dog. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, let me get to 6000, okay? Let me get to 6000. I'ma

10305
11:35:20,340 --> 11:35:28,340
keep it a Cosco Hot Dog and we'll do it when it gets to 6000 and then I will go to sleep.

10306
11:35:28,340 --> 11:35:45,340
Go to sleep. Go to sleep, my dear wee friend. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. I don't know what

10307
11:35:45,340 --> 11:35:52,340
I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. Freerooja ca, freerooja, dormee do. Oh, are you

10308
11:35:52,340 --> 11:36:02,340
having Scottish freerooja ca? Freerooja ca, freerooja ca, dormee do, dormee do. Sonny la

10309
11:36:02,340 --> 11:36:12,340
matina, sonny la matina, ding, ding, dong. That's absolutely purse. Stop it. Drop it.

10310
11:36:12,340 --> 11:36:18,340
Can you tuck his in? I don't know. Can you fuck me in? Like, I'm sorry. That was an

10311
11:36:18,340 --> 11:36:25,340
inside thought. That was for inside my head. I apologize, Riefen, for such vulgar obscenity.

10312
11:36:25,340 --> 11:36:36,340
Apologize. It was a slip of the tongue. I'll fire 1000 once before I let myself go over

10313
11:36:36,340 --> 11:36:46,340
but to stop. Okay. Do I need to go? I don't know when I need to go. Hitting on the back

10314
11:36:46,340 --> 11:36:58,340
streets. The blitzkrieg bop. Hey ho, let's go. Putting on the back line. Something else

10315
11:36:58,340 --> 11:37:08,340
they're all ripped off and ready to go. Okay, we might be able to get 6.8. Do you want me

10316
11:37:08,340 --> 11:37:18,340
to stop or do you want to make out what would you like to do? The choice is, I don't want

10317
11:37:18,340 --> 11:37:41,340
to be a fan. Speedrun, yeah. Are you trying to slip your tongue in the fucking? I'm the

10318
11:37:41,340 --> 11:37:43,580
I'm the one that tongues me, motherfucker.

10319
11:37:43,580 --> 11:37:45,580
Haha, okay.

10320
11:37:45,580 --> 11:37:49,100
Maybe one more inventory and then I go a bit.

10321
11:37:49,100 --> 11:37:50,620
Look at that, bub.

10322
11:37:50,620 --> 11:37:55,900
Under 69, that's the number, okay?

10323
11:37:55,900 --> 11:37:58,460
We are under 69.

10324
11:37:58,460 --> 11:38:00,540
I am going to go.

10325
11:38:00,540 --> 11:38:03,660
Will I use my ending screen?

10326
11:38:03,660 --> 11:38:05,660
Are you ready?

10327
11:38:05,660 --> 11:38:09,180
Okay, wait until the inventory is full and then we'll wait for the wine to pop,

10328
11:38:09,180 --> 11:38:11,260
okay? We just need the wine to pop.

10329
11:38:11,260 --> 11:38:13,820
We're about to pop, oh wait, I only have like 14 wine.

10330
11:38:13,820 --> 11:38:15,420
Okay, there's the wine to pop.

10331
11:38:15,420 --> 11:38:17,420
Okay, you ready?

10332
11:38:17,420 --> 11:38:18,540
What was I gonna do?

10333
11:38:18,540 --> 11:38:20,540
I've forgotten.

10334
11:38:20,540 --> 11:38:23,180
I don't know, I forgot.

10335
11:38:23,180 --> 11:38:24,220
Use the ending screen.

10336
11:38:24,220 --> 11:38:26,060
Oh, okay, yes, I will.

10337
11:38:26,060 --> 11:38:29,020
Okay, um, good night.

10338
11:38:29,020 --> 11:38:29,900
I love you.

10339
11:38:29,900 --> 11:38:34,220
I see you tomorrow and please, when you see the pregnant city,

10340
11:38:34,780 --> 11:38:39,900
go up, click on it and leave it in the background for the algorithm purposes.

10341
11:38:39,900 --> 11:38:43,820
And then wait a whole like 30 seconds before you like the video or something.

10342
11:38:43,820 --> 11:38:44,780
I don't know.

10343
11:38:44,780 --> 11:38:45,900
Good night, everything.

10344
11:38:45,900 --> 11:38:46,620
I love you.

10345
11:38:46,620 --> 11:38:48,940
I see you in the morning and we'll play Blinks,

10346
11:38:48,940 --> 11:38:50,620
which is a childhood game technically,

10347
11:38:50,620 --> 11:38:52,780
even though I got stuck on the second level.

10348
11:38:52,780 --> 11:38:55,100
Well, the second level.

10349
11:38:57,660 --> 11:38:58,540
Well, are you ready?

10350
11:38:58,940 --> 11:39:03,420
Look at that.

10351
11:39:03,420 --> 11:39:04,940
Honestly, look at them jibblies.

10352
11:39:06,220 --> 11:39:07,340
Streams ending.

10353
11:39:09,100 --> 11:39:10,620
Good night.

10354
11:39:10,620 --> 11:39:11,580
Reflings.

10355
11:39:11,580 --> 11:39:12,540
Good night.

10356
11:39:12,540 --> 11:39:13,580
Reflings.

10357
11:39:13,580 --> 11:39:14,540
Good night.

10358
11:39:14,540 --> 11:39:15,420
Reflings.

10359
11:39:15,420 --> 11:39:17,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

10360
11:39:18,060 --> 11:39:19,260
Good night.

10361
11:39:19,980 --> 11:39:20,780
Good night.

10362
11:39:20,780 --> 11:39:21,180
Bye bye.

10363
11:39:22,380 --> 11:39:23,820
Blah, blah, blah, blah, kiss.

10364
11:39:24,380 --> 11:39:31,020
I will talk in the streamers chat for one second

10365
11:39:31,020 --> 11:39:33,340
and then I'll go a bit again and go a bit.
