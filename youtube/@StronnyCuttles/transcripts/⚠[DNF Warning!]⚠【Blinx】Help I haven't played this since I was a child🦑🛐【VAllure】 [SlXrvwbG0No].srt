1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,680
We're just checking the stream health and then we're gonna get into it!

2
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,680
I've absolutely forgotten everything about this game.

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:36,080
I need to tap my wishbone to see me.

4
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,680
YouTube hasn't prompted me yet to...

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Oh there we go!

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Sorry if I worried anyone.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,680
The stuff is used.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,680
Good morning!

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:01:06,180
Okay I'mma just tell you, I'mma keep it a Costco hot dog and I'll buck 50.

10
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,680
I didn't do anything.

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,360
There's no secrets to spell.

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
I've not been active.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,800
I felt very ill after yesterday's stream and it took me so long to finally fall asleep

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
when I did.

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:25,480
I got 7 hours but the problem is I've only completed like the first level and maybe the

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,280
second one in my childhood, okay?

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,240
And this game goes for like 5 hours and so what I would normally do is watch someone

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,000
play it on like times 4 just to get a general idea of what I'm supposed to do but I didn't

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,800
have any time to watch someone else play it and we might be up shit creek when they paddle

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,120
in this game.

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,040
But I didn't realise this game is Japanese.

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,880
I don't know if that's in silly but like I've never got to any, I never got to a train

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,840
track level or none of that.

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't remember any of it so we're doing it live, hope yeah.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,120
So I might need just to come in my hood.

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
Only on Xbox.

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:31,360
It's called Blinks, I suppose it's like a blink in time maybe that's the play on words.

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,080
I've never heard of this game before as Japanese would never have guessed.

29
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
What from the Neko?

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,560
Oh I don't really recall much of this.

31
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
We'll do green because I'm green.

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,680
Please don't plan off your eyes folks, I won't.

33
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,200
I'm using a rare replay for this.

34
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,120
Oh you want to know a nice game developed in fact.

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,840
Instead of having to translate everything, like get everything voice acted in a different

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,640
voice, if you use a gibberish language you can universally push the game like that because

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,680
all you need to do then is a subtitle translation.

38
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,440
So this is a way to save money in a game dev studio.

39
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:28,360
That's why the popularity has gone up because damn they're just another cog in the machine.

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't believe it, not this game.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,640
We need to have Blinks.

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,320
We are back from the change of clothes.

43
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Hello reverse.

44
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,800
I'm so sorry if I scared you about how long it took for me to get the weight room up.

45
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:55,440
So I finished stream and then a kidney sleep and then just everything was gone for me.

46
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
What's happening?

47
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Why am I getting up to me?

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Sorry.

49
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Got to do a fun thing for someone.

50
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,440
That is an inviola right now.

51
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
See look it's Japanese!

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,440
The Tom Tom gang.

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
That's the evil.

54
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
That's how you know they're evil because they're called Tom Tom.

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
Using the streamers back on Sunday in time.

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Yeah get educated, get educated, get educated.

57
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Oh my god.

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Please tell me that's the final boss and there's nothing bigger because that's scary.

59
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Oh no!

60
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Oh my god.

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Oh he's that kawaii ne.

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Oh my god Blinks found his Oshi.

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Nando desu ka? Nani kore?

64
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Danger level exceeding.

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Oh no, what are we gonna do?

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,440
We must protect the other worlds.

67
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
We'll be cut off from the time factory.

68
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Its supply of time will be forever frozen.

69
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Run away, run away!

70
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
And Blinks said all employees stationed in the world exit immediately.

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Forget it buddy.

72
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
That one human romance.

73
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Oh Blinks a baddie.

74
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Oh he's sending it!

75
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,440
He said fucking send it!

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Meow!

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Okay Blinks a badass though.

78
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Oh cool.

79
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Oh shit.

80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Okay right tutorial let's go.

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Right I've got a cup of tea.

82
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm gonna pause once we get through the reading bit.

83
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Time sweep begins.

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Defeat all the time monsters.

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Right okay what do we do?

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
You found a time crystal.

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Look for time crystals of the same colour.

88
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Collect four crystals at least three must match.

89
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Okay.

90
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
You got a pause.

91
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Everything pauses except you.

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Oh this is what I need for this.

93
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Blinks!

94
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Oh come on its first thing in the morning.

95
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Come on, come on, come on.

96
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Hold down bravo and select the time control you want.

97
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,440
When you release bravo the time control goes into action.

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,440
By the way you can have only three time controls at once in your ammo.

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Three time controls at once in your ammo.

100
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Okay.

101
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Right I'm gonna pause champ.

102
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm just gonna have my cup of tea and do a little bit of yapping.

103
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Strongly doing yapping.

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Just get to the gameplay for once.

105
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
You know what refund?

106
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
You know what?

107
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
That's true.

108
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
That's true.

109
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
But how dare you?

110
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
One how dare you?

111
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Two?

112
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
How dare you?

113
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,440
I don't know why but the stream is the runescape thumbnail again.

114
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
That's weird.

115
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
No its blinks for me.

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Hold on.

117
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I'm just gonna reset the thumbnail now.

118
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,440
It is blinks for me.

119
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,440
I wholeheartedly is blinks.

120
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
But I will reset it.

121
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
That's strange.

122
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
That's twice that's happened now.

123
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,440
There's another stream where it was like refuse into the play as the right one.

124
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,440
We did not finish runescape 99 cooking but we are gonna do a finishing up stream soon.

125
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Where we tie off loose ends of games that we didn't complete or didn't finish off.

126
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
And then my YouTube frozen.

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Well sorry YouTube geez.

128
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Is this runescape?

129
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Look they had a bit of an update.

130
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
A bit of an overhaul.

131
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Okay I've re-changed it.

132
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
I don't know if that thumbnail worked or not.

133
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
I just noticed that it was like yes.

134
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Merci modi's of viewer.

135
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Made 10,000 subscribers.

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Congrats on the milestone.

137
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Merci.

138
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I love you.

139
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Yippee.

140
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,440
And then congrats to M.E.B.Zoo for 20,000 milestone.

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
We're so proud of you.

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Yippee.

143
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
The girls are doing fantastic.

144
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Let's go.

145
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Ba ba ba.

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Let's go.

147
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Ta ta ta.

148
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
And then next.

149
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
No.

150
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
This is from my guess.

151
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,440
So AC is going to have a YouTube role play ASMR role play come out.

152
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,440
My prediction is that she will be the next 10,000 subscribed talent.

153
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
And then I'll be Azura.

154
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,440
And then I can release the secret artwork for the 10,000 celebration.

155
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,440
I was like thanks for everyone to come over.

156
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
It was a pretty penny.

157
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
It was actually, I can tell you a funny story about the artwork.

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,440
So the artist, I hadn't worked with them before.

159
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,440
And we got to the point where we were like we need the fourth fix.

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,440
And then we just said, can you just hand over the source file and we'll do it ourselves.

161
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I got that, I got that back.

162
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
And it's right.

163
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,440
So here's the thing about art.

164
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,440
To hand over the source file is to hand over all the separate layers and everything in

165
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
it.

166
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Okay.

167
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
And we got to the fourth fix.

168
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
And normally an artist will charge for that.

169
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,440
They'll charge extra if you want the source file.

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,440
But what happened was both the artist and like the other side of the part because I

171
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,440
was having to work with a concept artist to get the fixes at the time.

172
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:05,440
And we were like, we were like, look, is it okay if we can just get the source file and

173
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I'll have our in-house concept artist fix it.

174
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
But it will still be made in your style.

175
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
There'll be absolutely nothing taken away.

176
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
And they're right here.

177
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Just take it.

178
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,440
That's how, like that artist is like, you have no idea how really bad it is.

179
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,440
Like, I've been, because I pay in advance, which I've kind of, I've been a bit hesitant

180
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,440
to do with other artists now because of a few incidences.

181
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
But yeah, that was really kind of them.

182
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,440
But I have to admit, it's absolutely hilarious that it was like, look, mate, we're trying

183
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
our best to get the fixes, but it's not working.

184
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
So just hand us the file.

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
And they actually did.

186
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
They were like, here, just take it.

187
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
And then I was like, okay, that's the commission over.

188
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Thank you.

189
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,440
But yes, I can't wait to show that artwork off.

190
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,440
But yes, Mercy and Emmy both hit a milestone last night.

191
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,440
Whilst I was asleep in my slumber, Gimli, Gimli was missing me.

192
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Oh my goodness.

193
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
She was all over me like a rash.

194
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
I'm like, no, no, don't worry.

196
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
We just been cheating.

197
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Don't you mind?

198
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Let's just take my arm.

199
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
They're like, they've had enough.

200
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,440
I don't have any updates because I kind of just passed out.

201
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I'm a bit dehydrated right now.

202
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I know.

203
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,440
The clipping program, I guess T minus 40 hours for the established clipper program.

204
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I need to write off all those fucking documents and sensitives and fucking rules of being like,

205
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
if your content turns to piss while you're with us, we have the right to just pay you

206
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
and then kick you out the program.

207
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
All that.

208
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Oh God.

209
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Oh God, more work.

210
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Bleeding Hearts News, Azure's multiple organisms under the microscope for audio is ready.

211
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,440
And I think it's 20 minutes long.

212
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Yeah, I believe it's 20 minutes long.

213
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Once Blinks finishes and granted, I don't go far enough, Bleeding Hearts, your thing's

214
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
going to go up.

215
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Reeflings, our thing is being temporarily swapped.

216
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I am going to make a different type of meta audio, which I've already forgotten what I

217
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,440
was going to make, but it was a hell of a lot easier than finishing off the current script.

218
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:47,440
So I'm recording that tonight and then I'm editing it and it should go up.

219
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,440
And then the pregnancy should go up on YouTube.

220
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,440
And then I'm going to take a look at ACs because I might be able to edit ACs without much problems

221
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
at all, but I think I need Folly.

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,440
I think I need new SFX for AC because she's doing, right, close your ears if you don't

223
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
have any spoilers for the next minute.

224
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,440
AC's role play is like scratching your back and scratching your hair ASMR with her claws.

225
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,440
So I'm going to have to put on fake nails to get like skin sounds like...

226
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Hope you got a good read.

227
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I got something.

228
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Let's, I think, go.

229
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Yes, that's a lot of organisms.

230
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
It is.

231
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
There was three organisms.

232
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
So I hope you're all ready for that.

233
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm a slurp my coffee.

234
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I don't drink coffee.

235
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Slurp my tea.

236
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Actually, I'll tell you something really sad.

237
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,440
I bought coffee for my dad and his empty coffee jar was on the counter whilst I was making

238
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,440
the kettle, like the kettle boiled and I was like, I don't know.

239
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I'm like, ah, shit.

240
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Okay, that's kind of sad.

241
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Oh boy, I love where organisms under the telescope are mentioned truly.

242
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,440
You sent Chipper this morning for someone that had nae sleep?

243
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
Mama, I had an idea last night.

244
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Yes?

245
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,440
You were talking about doing all six girls as lowly pops for an ASMR.

246
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Yes, I probably will.

247
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,440
And I think someone mentioned calling it Operation Honeypot, but instead, how about Operation

248
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Honeypot?

249
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Due to legal advice from my legal team, a veiler headquarters, I cannot make a comment

250
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
on how absolutely hilarious that concept is.

251
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Thank you, tiny Spanish.

252
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
That is ridiculous.

253
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Oh my God, that's so good.

254
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Right.

255
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
So we were going to change the audio.

256
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,440
You reeflings that are on my Patreon are okay with this.

257
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,440
I was going to change the audio to, if you're going to groom my girls, groom them right.

258
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,440
If that's okay with you guys.

259
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Yes, it's outrageous.

260
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Oh my God, you know how we redirected into, it was like, oh God, I'm going to say it horribly wrong.

261
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
It was Kion.

262
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
It was a Kion.

263
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm going to say I'm absolutely butchering her name right now.

264
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Hold on.

265
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Hold on.

266
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Hold on.

267
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Hold on.

268
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
Hold on.

269
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Hold on.

270
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Wait, what?

271
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,440
AC leaks veiler's 3D debuts.

272
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
You better not have.

273
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Oh, this is, so AC sent me this, wait, hold on, hold on.

274
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Let me pull it up.

275
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Let me pull it up.

276
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
I'm going to put the link in the chat.

277
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
AC sends me this thing, right?

278
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
And she's like, can I get it turned into a short?

279
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,440
I'm like, sure, I have absolutely no idea what this is.

280
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,440
And she starts like wetting herself like, this is what the 3D debut from veiler is going to be like.

281
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,440
I'm like, AC, I'm fucking sweating my arse off here.

282
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I don't think the order releases matter.

283
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Okay.

284
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
It was so funny.

285
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Literally.

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Am I being daft?

287
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,440
I think I am.

288
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Oh, it was Keon.

289
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I knew it was Keon.

290
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Fucking, we redirected into Keon and then she goes like, oh, I was lurking your stream.

291
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,440
And I'm like, oh, blit.

292
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Bruh.

293
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
When other VTubers lurk my streams, all they get is me either.

294
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,440
One, going on an absolutely schizophrenic rant about whatever's upsetting me.

295
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Two, they get just me straight up saying that I'm r-word in any refund and site.

296
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Three, it's the most inappropriate misconduct plausible in the VTuber community.

297
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,440
I'm like, what do you mean you lurk on my streams?

298
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
What do you mean?

299
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
You're making me nervous.

300
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,440
But I'm not going to lie, she actually kind of sold the Lombok in my corporation game.

301
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,440
I'm going to look at gameplay because she kind of had me.

302
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Like, she kind of had me.

303
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
The best first impression ever.

304
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,440
It's pronounced Sion.

305
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
What do I say?

306
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Sion.

307
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Sion.

308
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Oh, that makes sense.

309
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Sion heart.

310
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Okay.

311
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
That makes more sense than what?

312
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes, I'm still here, Xbox.

313
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Please don't kick me off line.

314
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm going to say I get to finish my thingies.

315
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,440
It's real fun until you hit week three.

316
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Oh no.

317
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
Strawny playing blanks.

318
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Yes, I'm finishing my cup of tea and then we're going to go through the tutorial

319
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,440
and we're going to see how far I can get in the game because as a child,

320
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,440
I only played the first mission over and over

321
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,440
and I never got any further.

322
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,440
My dad didn't know how to play it so I couldn't be like that.

323
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,440
Go ahead and hit me again.

324
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Hold it.

325
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Xbox.

326
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
She ain't done yet, but honestly.

327
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Cozy lobotomy corp stream.

328
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Xbox.

329
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Come on.

330
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Just play me.

331
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Oh God.

332
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,440
The people is really good, but it's a big hit or miss depending on people.

333
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
You are cup of tea.

334
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Good advice with no guff is invaluable.

335
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Not surprised they're hanging up.

336
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,440
Is this game that hard?

337
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,440
I mean, I was like a Barbie when I played as a child, literally.

338
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Like, I played video games before I could even read or write, basically.

339
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,440
So, like, it's always been in my spirit, you know?

340
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,440
But please remember that I only started playing video games at two years old

341
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,440
for the attention of guys.

342
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
I just thought you should know that.

343
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I don't actually like video games.

344
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Stop.

345
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Stop.

346
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
iPad.

347
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,440
No, I never had an iPad.

348
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
I never had.

349
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,440
That is a reference before anyone's like, what on earth are you going on about?

350
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,440
That was a reference I made in yesterday's 12 hour stream.

351
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Good luck finding it.

352
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,440
I basically long story short, my sarcasm horrifically backfired.

353
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Someone said to me, why do you play video games?

354
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,440
And I thought it was just the most bizarre thing.

355
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I was like, well, everyone plays video games.

356
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Why are you asking me in particular about why I play them?

357
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,440
But it was clearly like, you're a girl, why do you play them?

358
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
So then I sarcastically wrote back, I do it for male attention.

359
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
I don't actually like video games.

360
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,440
And the guy didn't argue and it was the end of conversation.

361
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
And I was like, shit, that backfired.

362
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,440
So there is a guy currently out there with a fallacy about like, no girls actually do pretend to enjoy video games for attention.

363
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,440
And it's all because of my sarcasm.

364
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Womp, womp, womp.

365
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Motherfucking womp.

366
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Actually ridiculous.

367
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,440
Ridiculous.

368
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Oh my God, Nanny has the KU100 microphone.

369
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,440
I just looked at her thumbnail and she's like $20,000 audio.

370
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,440
I'm like, yeah, damn, that's quite the commission, Nanny.

371
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,440
You've got quite the price per minute.

372
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Quite the price tag per word.

373
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
That guy's name, Albert Einstein, literally.

374
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,440
Guys, she's a fake gamer girl, she plays with the controller.

375
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,440
Literally, the controller isn't even on right now, don't we talk about?

376
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,440
There's actually a reef one under the desk right now playing.

377
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,440
And yes, that reefing, literally, yeah.

378
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Is that blinks? It is, unbelievable.

379
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
Okay, I finished my tea, I've had half a cup of water.

380
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,440
And the words of the coconut and Elden Ring.

381
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Let's get to it.

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Hi.

383
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Right.

384
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Okay, right, okay.

385
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Oh, you found some trash.

386
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Hold X to speak.

387
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Okay, that looks a lot easier.

388
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
With trash, you can shoot time monsters.

389
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,440
By the way, you can have only five at a time.

390
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Okay, can I do the light?

391
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
No.

392
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
Whoa.

393
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh, the...

394
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
I'm bug, I'm getting blinded.

395
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Try to pick up this garbage.

396
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Right, I can only have five ammo in the chamber at once.

397
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Oh, I was supposed to pause it.

398
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
And because now it's inaccessible.

399
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
I don't know what that...

400
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
Yeah, it's inaccessible.

401
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Okay, that's fine, I can handle that.

402
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Right, let's get full ammo.

403
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Let's get more familiar.

404
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Oh, God, the...

405
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Oh, or not, let's just...

406
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
I guess I just...

407
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Yeah, okay, that's fine.

408
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
I can hear something bouncing.

409
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Right, how do I throw it at the camera?

410
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,440
The camera goes the wrong way.

411
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
It's time to pull, right trigger, or tap X to shoot.

412
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Oh, my God!

413
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
Okay, okay.

414
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
What is this?

415
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I don't know.

416
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
You gotta pause.

417
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,440
What is this?

418
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
16 tons!

419
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
16 tons of wet...

420
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
tons of shite!

421
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Alright, X is to fire.

422
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
Wait.

423
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Okay, I was about to be like,

424
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
wait, this is so easy.

425
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,440
Why did I struggle in childhood?

426
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
Right, so suck them up.

427
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Okay, hold on, let me suck, let me suck.

428
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I will admit visually it's a bit rough.

429
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
I don't know how to get rid of the...

430
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
What?

431
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,440
We have ammo, that's the main thing.

432
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Let's open up this door.

433
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
We're getting there.

434
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Did he just hit the griddy on that?

435
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
I think he did.

436
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
What's this?

437
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
What's that?

438
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
Oh, there's a wee enemy on the wall!

439
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
What did I do with him?

440
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Oh, I don't know.

441
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,440
Oh, there's an enemy down here.

442
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
I don't know what I was supposed to do with that.

443
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Was that like a secret?

444
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Oh, I forgot.

445
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
It's X to fire.

446
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Hurry to the goal gate.

447
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Okay, I'm off.

448
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
That's the goal gate.

449
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Let's go.

450
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Okay, we did it!

451
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,440
We finished the tutorial.

452
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Okay, game over.

453
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Oh no!

454
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
My elite gameplay!

455
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
There's a replay!

456
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Oh my god, that's embarrassing.

457
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,440
There's a replay on my...

458
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Oh.

459
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Oh no.

460
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
Real credit.

461
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
What game is next?

462
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Oh no, not me trying to get in between the graphics.

463
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Oh, he's so smiley.

464
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,440
He looks like Cheshire.

465
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
Okay, right.

466
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
That's not bad.

467
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Live action replay.

468
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Stage 2.

469
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
And then a shop.

470
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Welcome to the shop.

471
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Total gold shop.

472
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Oh my god, this is so Japanese.

473
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
A time holder.

474
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Exit.

475
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
A retry holder.

476
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,440
A time holder out of stock.

477
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
This succomatic.

478
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
A new fit.

479
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Okay, thank you.

480
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,440
You didn't find anything.

481
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Sorry, you couldn't find anything.

482
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
I hope you'll come again.

483
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
I don't know what I'm doing.

484
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Your fastest time, 10 minutes.

485
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Sir, I haven't even played this game.

486
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Right, okay.

487
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Right, let's do this.

488
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Let's get to it.

489
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Right, first we'll put...

490
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
We'll get all the ammo.

491
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
We'll get all the ammo.

492
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
Chat is a cat.

493
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
Everybody wants to be a cat.

494
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Because the cat's the only cat.

495
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,440
A noose, where is it?

496
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
What is that?

497
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Beed.

498
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,440
Right, okay.

499
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
We've got pauses.

500
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
I'll take pauses.

501
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
Well, that doesn't look like a pause.

502
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Right, let's go find some enemies.

503
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,440
Ooh.

504
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
I see gold.

505
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Right, ready?

506
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
Three, two, one, bonk.

507
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
And then we'll reload.

508
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Like, come on.

509
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
Currently, you only have three controls at once.

510
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
How do I activate that?

511
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
I don't even know.

512
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I've forgotten...

513
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Is it B?

514
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
It's B.

515
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Okay, bravo to pause.

516
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Ooh.

517
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
We've got two slows.

518
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Wait, why did that change?

519
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Use slow to tankroll.

520
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,440
Try using it to fight enemies and avoid hazards.

521
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Ooh, yeah.

522
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Ooh, yeah!

523
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Wait, am I already dead in the game?

524
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
I only have one heart.

525
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Ooh, yeah.

526
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Piss.

527
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Right, you had a play.

528
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Right, you?

529
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Piss off.

530
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
No, you.

531
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
What are you aiming at?

532
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Blinks, please don't.

533
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
Danger, when it's...

534
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
I'm out.

535
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
I'm out.

536
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Oh, I just killed myself.

537
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
I just killed myself.

538
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
I actually just killed myself.

539
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Ooh!

540
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Ooh, I can't see any of the enemies.

541
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
I don't know.

542
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,440
The controller's so bad.

543
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Okay, hold on.

544
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Am I safe now?

545
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Can I just aimball at it?

546
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Oh, my gosh.

547
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Okay, I missed.

548
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
That's okay.

549
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
Okay, I missed again.

550
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Oh, my God, stop.

551
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
It's all coming apart.

552
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
It's all coming apart.

553
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
I should have played this.

554
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
I should have played it off-stream.

555
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Okay, I'm sorry.

556
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,440
I'm sorry, leaflings.

557
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
I'm sorry.

558
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
I should have played it off-stream.

559
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
I'm not even kidding.

560
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
How do I wallop it from here?

561
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Okay, that was right.

562
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Try again.

563
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
Okay, we did it.

564
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Okay, we did it.

565
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Oh, my God, I should have played it off-stream.

566
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Eat his heart, real.

567
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
All right.

568
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
Is there anything I can make here?

569
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
I've got two hearts.

570
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,440
I can just go full ammo and grab his gold again.

571
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Oh, my God.

572
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Oh, well.

573
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,440
I would like another love heart, if possible, but...

574
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
I can't see.

575
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Blinks, please.

576
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
The camera angle.

577
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
Whoa, go the money.

578
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Money.

579
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
This looks like a boss fight.

580
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
How did I deal with it?

581
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
Oh, the camera, please.

582
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
Camera angle.

583
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
Work with me.

584
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
What did I do?

585
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Just threw shit at him.

586
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
Oh, shit, I'm dead?

587
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I have no more lives.

588
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I literally have no more lives.

589
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay.

590
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Okay.

591
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
There's a guy there.

592
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
You got a renew.

593
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Oh, it's a rewind.

594
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Sorry.

595
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
I didn't sign up for an MLG.

596
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
Thank goodness, because this is awful.

597
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
This is not going the way...

598
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Ooh, what are you?

599
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
You got a secret cap medal.

600
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Collect lots of these to unlock kill stuff.

601
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Okay.

602
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Oh, hearts.

603
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
I need hearts.

604
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
I need all the freaking hearts I can get.

605
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
I'm not even kidding.

606
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Please help me.

607
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Okay.

608
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Howdy.

609
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
Hi.

610
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
Thanks for joining.

611
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
I'm sorry that my MLG gameplay isn't that good.

612
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
You got a retry.

613
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Okay.

614
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
A retry gives you another chance.

615
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
Okay, right.

616
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
That is what I'm needing.

617
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,440
I guess some stuff can be...

618
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
No one...

619
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Oh, my God.

620
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I really struggle to get used to this camera angle.

621
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
I need to pick up ammo.

622
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
What did I see?

623
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
Maybe our time control can fix this.

624
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,440
What, like right now?

625
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
And what did that do exactly?

626
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Did I just waste that?

627
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
No, we just...

628
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
We just...

629
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
No!

630
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
Motherfucker!

631
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Okay.

632
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
So that was your stuff.

633
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,440
So I don't know why you told me about that.

634
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
Don't do that again.

635
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,440
Where are the flowerbites considered...

636
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Literally!

637
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
What's up here?

638
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
I need to aimbot this motherfucker.

639
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
Ah!

640
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
No!

641
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
I'm scared.

642
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Stop being invisible!

643
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I don't have any more ammo!

644
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
Don't think I won't run away and pick up more ammo.

645
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
You stay there.

646
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
I'm coming back to beat you up.

647
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
I need to suck up this park bench first.

648
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
You're so rude.

649
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,440
Time stop for real.

650
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,440
I guess these guys.

651
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,440
The greatest game of all time?

652
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Is it?

653
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Oh, good.

654
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,440
If it is, I'm doing it zero justice right now.

655
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Like, actually zero justice.

656
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,440
This game, a lot easier to play in my head as a child.

657
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,440
The camera is killing me.

658
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
The camera goes the wrong way.

659
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,440
No!

660
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Right there.

661
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
One monster.

662
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Him?

663
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Blinks!

664
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,440
You're constantly not looking at the right thing.

665
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
I don't know why he hates me.

666
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,440
Just say you hate me.

667
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Right, so this is the door.

668
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
Is that door him?

669
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
I like how if you kill the monster,

670
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
I actually have a symbol on the ground to be like,

671
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
I guess war.

672
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
200 gold for this level?

673
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
That's actually like tons.

674
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
Okay, let's go.

675
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Fun idea for a future collab.

676
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
Have you heard of Giga Bash?

677
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
It's a molecular monster fight game.

678
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
I actually haven't heard of it.

679
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Mummy freezes time and main breaks.

680
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
That's kind of hard to gameplay.

681
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,440
Wait, there was a third secret I didn't see?

682
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
My fastest, I got rank D.

683
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
You know what else got rank D?

684
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Okay, that's cute.

685
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,440
Now, can we do the first boss level?

686
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
Oh no, stage three, my apologies.

687
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
First ammo.

688
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
This is the main thing.

689
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
We need it every time.

690
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
We need the ammo.

691
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Give me the ammo.

692
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
We need to be safe.

693
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Because if I have five ammo,

694
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,440
then it means we can just fire away.

695
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,440
I like how the street things actually do try and put you in the right way.

696
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Like if you're going the wrong way, the game's like,

697
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
hello, maybe don't do that way.

698
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,440
Oh, is there no secret here?

699
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Release me!

700
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,440
Got that camera angle is really bothering me.

701
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Hopefully I can get some more hearts.

702
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
Oh jeez.

703
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Please, I'm just a cat.

704
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
I'm just a cat.

705
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,440
Whoa, you can ride barrels, barrel rider.

706
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Okay, we don't, I don't know what these 10G things are about.

707
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,440
Right, it's giving me two stars, so I just need one star.

708
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
Almost got it.

709
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,440
Oh my god, the game is actually giving me positive affirmations.

710
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
Okay, thank you.

711
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,440
Five monsters to go.

712
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
Who or what?

713
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
How do I aim for that?

714
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
How do I aim for that?

715
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Can I like jump and shoot?

716
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Oh my god, I can!

717
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,440
Blinks, what the heck?

718
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
That was so cool.

719
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,440
I didn't even know I could jump and aim.

720
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,440
I'm not going to pick anything up because I've no got, I'm assuming those guys, I'm supposed to wall it when I see them, but...

721
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
I don't know if we're doing it in time.

722
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
Great.

723
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
Blinks, can you all walk?

724
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
No way!

725
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Okay, okay, no, hold on, sorry, I keep accidentally opening up that B now.

726
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Much regretty, big spaghetti.

727
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Right, you?

728
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Oh, I missed, sorry, let's try again.

729
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Oh!

730
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

731
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Right, stop pressing B, do you understand?

732
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Yes, I'm sorry.

733
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,440
Right, we're going to throw away this because we're going to pick up the hearts because I want hearts.

734
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
I haven't played it so long, I'm going to play it.

735
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
There's a blinks too!

736
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Okay, how do I auto-lock to him?

737
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,440
Oh my god, I'm actually so good, I'm actually so good.

738
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Who spawned me into this world as a gamer?

739
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,440
Oh my god, and I have more life.

740
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,440
Hold, it's clicking, it's clicking.

741
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,440
You got to let me warm up, okay?

742
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,440
It's like I'm a hot skillet on a stove right now, got to let me warm up.

743
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,440
That's it, this round is done, I'm just so good.

744
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,440
I'm actually just so good, we've already done it.

745
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,440
I'm officially warm, time's sweet complete, and we got out with the health.

746
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,440
I'm just so good at this game.

747
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Surely I'm not going to get stuck anywhere.

748
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Sorry, sorry Elden Ring gamers, Bloodborne gamers.

749
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
Do you guys think that's a challenge?

750
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
This is a challenge.

751
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,440
No secrets, but no, you didn't read that, no, no, right.

752
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,440
We have 500 gold, so can we do anything with this?

753
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
A retry holder, a thousand for more health.

754
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
Okay, that to me looks good to me.

755
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
We'll do a thousand for health.

756
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,440
Now, if we get walloped in the boss and I die and have to restart the game.

757
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Am I playing on it?

758
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,440
No, this.

759
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Why you just, I didn't, you just, what do I do?

760
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,440
What do I do?

761
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
What do I do?

762
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
I couldn't even run that far, I tried.

763
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,440
I didn't even give me a chance.

764
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,440
Fucking one pause, fucking let's relax.

765
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Two, let me pick up some items.

766
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Oh my God, I can't even shoot him because he's in the fucking air.

767
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Oh my God, please.

768
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Oh, I can't even do anything, he's in the air.

769
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Fuck you, fuck you.

770
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,440
Oh shit, he's invincible.

771
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Shit, I forget they get invincible.

772
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Noob wasted all that ammo.

773
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God.

774
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Just a little bit of panic at the time.

775
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,440
It is perfectly normal to feel panicked in a video game.

776
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
Oh my God, I can't hit anything.

777
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
What the fuck does this one do?

778
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,440
Slow, yeah, yeah, you better slow down.

779
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
Yeah, boom, bitch.

780
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,440
Yeah, get fucked.

781
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
Okay, what's that?

782
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
He needs like two more hits or something.

783
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Okay, he's gonna do his wee thing.

784
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
I'm gonna reload.

785
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,440
Gimme, gimme, ammo, gimme, ammo, gimme, ammo.

786
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Okay, get right.

787
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
I'm gonna pop you like a damn balloon.

788
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Do you understand?

789
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Do you understand?

790
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh my God, I'm so good.

791
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,440
I'm actually, oh my God, I'm so good at this game.

792
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
Oh my God, the level's already over.

793
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Give me all the monies.

794
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
Money, money, money.

795
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,440
Can we get a thousand?

796
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Oh no, it disappeared.

797
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Oh well, it's fine.

798
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Hold on, wait, maybe we can pick up a few more pennies.

799
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
I would like to get another health holder

800
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
for no particular reason at all.

801
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
I would like more health.

802
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Oh my God, I thought he was putting me in another fight there.

803
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,440
I just got shivers.

804
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,440
I thought he was shoving me in another fight.

805
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
I'm like, no, don't do that.

806
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
That's rude.

807
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Don't do that.

808
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Right, there's no secrets in boss levels.

809
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
That's fine.

810
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Good job, my man.

811
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,440
Thank you.

812
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,440
Maybe you can suck up the money when you're back.

813
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Maybe that would have been faster.

814
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Phase two?

815
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
I ain't doing a phase two.

816
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Okay, so we've technically finished

817
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,440
tutorial island in this game.

818
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,440
We are now going to the deja vu canals.

819
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Okay, as always, we will pick up ammo

820
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
and take it from there.

821
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Elden Ring Who?

822
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
Dark Souls Where?

823
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,440
This is weird.

824
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
That's exactly what I said.

825
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Oh, there's money.

826
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,440
Oh, there's enemies.

827
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,440
Okay, it seems to have a hidden auto lock,

828
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
especially for those monsters,

829
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
which is understand, oh, we can ride the water.

830
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Yeah, the auto lock is like moving in,

831
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
which I'm quite, I'm happy to see that.

832
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
I think that's very, stop.

833
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Yeah, let me just slow-mo.

834
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Yeah, sorry, I really needed to slow-mo the section.

835
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,440
Things were just getting a bit too,

836
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,440
a bit too much for me.

837
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Can I even jump up there?

838
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
I think I'm too small.

839
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Oh my God, you can do a backflip.

840
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Wait, do that again.

841
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Oh, you're so talented, Blake.

842
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
What the heck?

843
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Oh my, wait, wait, wait, wait, it's stunning.

844
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
No wonder he was a badass and was like,

845
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,440
nah, don't worry, guys, I got this.

846
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
You guys all run away? I've got this.

847
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
Okay, I can't actually reach that,

848
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,440
because I'm too small, which is fine.

849
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Understand, what happened, I think.

850
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Whee!

851
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Money, hold on.

852
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Money!

853
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Okay.

854
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
I am going to prioritize health right now,

855
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
because we have...

856
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,440
In terms of health, we have none.

857
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Although, wait, can I make something out of these?

858
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,440
I've got a star, star, two triangles.

859
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Oh, I've got three triangles.

860
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
Okay, let's do three triangles.

861
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,440
Slow mo, no double jump.

862
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Oh, there's double jump as well, what the...

863
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Man, for a Neckle, you sure are agile.

864
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Okay, we've got one thing.

865
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
You've got a fast forward, I assume.

866
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Use fast forward to make time flow rapidly forward

867
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
and shave time off the clock.

868
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,440
When you use FF, it also gives immunity.

869
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Okay, that's curious.

870
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Right, we are going to go for hearts.

871
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Uh, what's going on over here?

872
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Okay, bit of water, yeah.

873
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Bit of a water mission, yeah.

874
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Right, you done four.

875
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Nice knowing you, haven't I, say?

876
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
I hear someone bouncing.

877
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Oh, I keep sorry, I keep doing that, but...

878
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
Isn't the whole point of Neckles and cats as they're agile?

879
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Right, we're going in the sewers.

880
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Ah!

881
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
See, I like old games, because their secrets are like,

882
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,440
go down this non-obscure path that's really obvious.

883
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
I'm like, thank you, that helps.

884
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
That actually makes...

885
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
Wait, am I going to get nuked?

886
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
I see him, is he about to throw stuff at me?

887
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Sorry, Mr. Frog, your time is up.

888
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
Oh!

889
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Hold on, the camera angle is killing me right now.

890
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
Oh, he's locked onto me!

891
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,440
No, no, he's eating things, I'm giving him!

892
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Is he chasing me?

893
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Oh, I love older games.

894
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
I love older games.

895
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
I love it, I really do.

896
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
I love when they don't look at me.

897
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,440
Right, so we're going up there, clearly at one point as well.

898
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,440
Oh!

899
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
I spoke too soon!

900
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,440
I spoke too soon, can I hit him in the back?

901
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,440
I'm going to have to, you're out of bounds!

902
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,440
Okay, I was going to say, you're literally out of bounds.

903
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
How am I supposed to do anything?

904
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Right, let's pick up the bomb.

905
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,440
Watch the stream in 360 for the true experience, that's so good.

906
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Let's get a heart.

907
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Let's pick up some more things.

908
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,440
I need a dollar, I don't know.

909
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I need...

910
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Okay, I can't believe we went to Italy together.

911
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,440
Okay.

912
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Oh, did I use furniture to get up?

913
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,440
Oh my god, the camera, please, you're killing me.

914
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Okay, okay, okay.

915
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,440
My brain is expanding, I can use furniture to get up.

916
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
I understand, I understand.

917
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,440
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say,

918
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,440
I'm going to have to throw away these hearts in order to get across this bridge.

919
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,440
Oh wait, I almost messed that up there, not going to lie,

920
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,440
I almost messed that up there, but it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

921
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,440
Right, we've got to rewind.

922
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,440
X to suck, B to select.

923
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,440
We're getting there and then rewind time so I can get the bridge.

924
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Okay, then go across and then wallop him.

925
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,440
And then wallop him with a fucking bomb, apparently.

926
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,440
Look, that didn't happen and you can't prove it.

927
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,440
Wait, it re-winded the enemies back.

928
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Right, fuck you, bomb.

929
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
I need to run away from the bomb unironically.

930
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,440
Did I get him?

931
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Oh, I can have a heart, oh thank gosh.

932
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,440
Unfortunately my voice is still mildly strange, yeah.

933
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,440
I'm pretty sure if I wallop him, he'll come out with gold or something as a reward.

934
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,440
Okay, we have another heart.

935
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
It's weird because I think I saw you bomb yourself.

936
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,440
No, no, self-inflicted silliness proof.

937
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
Right, whose door is opening?

938
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,440
What was that?

939
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Do that again.

940
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,440
He's really trying to get us to work.

941
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
I guess we go down here.

942
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,440
Okay, right, you, go on.

943
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,440
Okay, he has two health.

944
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Okay, they're getting a bit more, giving a bit more HP but I'm needing a bit more HP too.

945
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,440
You can't have all the HP.

946
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,440
You can't have all of it.

947
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm gonna do the star thing because I think we're gonna need it.

948
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
You go a slow, I'll take it.

949
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
What are you calling me?

950
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
TV.

951
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
I like how it's like all junk and stuff.

952
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
It's actually pretty creepy.

953
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
I'm gonna try and get another heart.

954
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
So we're gonna leave that behind.

955
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
Oh wait, no, it's the end of the level.

956
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,440
Yeah, we killed all the enemies.

957
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Top right, old tails.

958
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
I'm gonna suck.

959
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Oh my gosh.

960
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
Oh my.

961
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Right, now we can buy another heart container.

962
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Oh my gosh.

963
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,440
Now I don't want to get too cocky.

964
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,440
No, I don't want to get too cocky.

965
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,440
But hold on a minute.

966
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,440
I think we may, we may have a chance.

967
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
It's just a conspiracy.

968
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,440
I think we may have a chance.

969
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,440
We may have a chance to win him.

970
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,440
Oh, wait, there's 10 levels?

971
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,440
If there's only 10 levels in this game, we won.

972
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
I'm calling it now, we actually won.

973
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,440
I actually don't get sun logged.

974
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Right.

975
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
A retry holder for 1000.

976
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Thank you.

977
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,440
This lets you collect and use another retry.

978
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Absolute.

979
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,440
Wait the game.

980
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Okay, wait what?

981
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
It's on order?

982
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,440
It's on order?

983
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
What do you mean it's on order?

984
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,440
Okay.

985
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,440
And then what?

986
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,440
Pay.

987
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,440
Oh.

988
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,440
Okay, you have to like be rang up apparently.

989
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,440
Okay, we now have four health.

990
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,440
Can I exit please?

991
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,440
Jeez.

992
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,440
We now have four health.

993
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,440
And like total.

994
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,440
The difficulty still save one star.

995
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,440
You're making it.

996
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,440
There's nine monsters in this one.

997
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,440
I thought it was a microtransaction.

998
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,440
Real.

999
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,440
Okay.

1000
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,440
We now have four health.

1001
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,440
I don't know how big our health can go,

1002
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,440
but I'm definitely wanting to put all the stonks

1003
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,440
into having as much health as possible.

1004
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,440
Because as there's more monsters in the game,

1005
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,440
difficulty increases.

1006
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,440
Yeah, I definitely did not get this far as a child.

1007
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,440
I'm not even kidding.

1008
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,440
I don't recall any of this.

1009
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,440
Okay.

1010
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,440
Okay.

1011
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Which is such a shame.

1012
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,440
I must have tried so hard.

1013
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,440
My dad must have had to listen to it.

1014
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1015
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,440
Well, I guess that's your problem now.

1016
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,440
Oh, I keep, sorry.

1017
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,440
I keep hitting B, please forgive.

1018
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,440
I'm dumb.

1019
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
Well, there's something up here.

1020
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,440
Stop camera, please.

1021
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,440
Why are you inverted?

1022
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,440
Hello.

1023
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,440
What?

1024
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,440
I literally fucking cheated.

1025
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,440
I literally just cheated.

1026
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,440
I literally just cheated.

1027
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,440
You're fucking

1028
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,440
staying.

1029
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,440
Honestly.

1030
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,440
Right, you died.

1031
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,440
Yeah.

1032
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,440
Okay.

1033
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Literally just spawned right in front of me.

1034
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,440
What cheeky we saw.

1035
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,440
Honestly.

1036
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,440
I didn't know games had respawn like that.

1037
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,440
I thought it was just if the enemy was gone,

1038
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,440
the game accepted your fate.

1039
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
We're only on one health.

1040
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,440
This is not looking good, right?

1041
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,440
B, reverse,

1042
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,440
and then run across and hit the button.

1043
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,440
Okay.

1044
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,440
And hit the button.

1045
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,440
Oh, I saw it up there.

1046
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,440
I see it.

1047
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,440
How am I supposed to climb all the way up there?

1048
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,440
You've already beaten record.

1049
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Pretty much it.

1050
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,440
This is a dub, okay?

1051
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,440
Right, I seem to have opened some sort of location.

1052
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,440
Oh,

1053
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,440
I was right here.

1054
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,440
Okay.

1055
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Okay, that auto lock.

1056
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,440
I have to admit

1057
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
that auto lock, gorgeous.

1058
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Whoever came up with that

1059
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
stunning

1060
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,440
and deserves a kiss on the lips.

1061
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,440
Oh wait, I actually don't want to

1062
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
fast forward, you know that.

1063
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,440
I'll take a, I'll take a slow.

1064
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,440
Slow is good.

1065
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,440
Something

1066
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,440
is going whack, whack over there.

1067
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,440
Is it friendly?

1068
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,440
Well, it's easy, so it's not that bad.

1069
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,440
It's all about boundaries and targets.

1070
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,440
Setting your new personal best, exactly.

1071
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Oh, not enough power.

1072
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Oh, okay.

1073
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
The game is

1074
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,440
insinuating I should probably have a better

1075
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,440
sucker at this point.

1076
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,440
I spent it all on health though.

1077
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,440
Right, what happens in Vienna

1078
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,440
stays in Vienna.

1079
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,440
There's like a secret gamble machine

1080
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,440
in this game.

1081
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,440
I see the money on the bridge.

1082
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Right, what's going on down here?

1083
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,440
I seem to have a rewind again

1084
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,440
offered to me.

1085
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,440
Wait, something's happening.

1086
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,440
Oh, is it just a bridge in general?

1087
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,440
Am I supposed to rewind?

1088
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,440
Am I supposed to rewind?

1089
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:22,440
Oh, no, you can go in war. It's fine.

1090
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,440
It must be for the bridge above.

1091
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,440
I don't know, maybe it did something.

1092
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,440
Oh, sugar.

1093
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,440
Hold on, wait, mate, hold on, wait.

1094
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,440
I can't get up the ramp, mate, hold on.

1095
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,440
You'll need to, you'll need to hold on, mate.

1096
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,440
I can't get up the ramp. I can't.

1097
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,440
Right, hold on.

1098
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,440
Before you beat me up, let me...

1099
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,440
He is coming.

1100
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,440
Can he drown? Please drown.

1101
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,440
I know he's an amphibian, okay?

1102
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,440
I can even get up on that platform.

1103
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,440
How's that?

1104
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,440
He can't get on the platform either.

1105
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,440
Did something break?

1106
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,440
I think I'm supposed to reverse.

1107
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,440
I don't know what's going to happen if I reverse, but...

1108
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Oh, one of the boats broke.

1109
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,440
Right, hold on.

1110
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,440
I don't know what I'm reversing right now, but...

1111
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,440
No?

1112
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,440
Oh, he never even...

1113
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,440
He never even spawned in at this point!

1114
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Did I just need to run?

1115
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,440
Fuck it.

1116
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Oh!

1117
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,440
This is what I mean!

1118
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Fucking eat that bomb, you bam!

1119
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
I mean, she...

1120
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Well, we're here, mate, I'll take it.

1121
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,440
Okay.

1122
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,440
We have two rewinds now.

1123
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,440
It's very neat, please.

1124
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,440
It gets pretty tough past the halfway point.

1125
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,440
Don't say such things!

1126
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,440
Oh, is this what I needed to rewind for?

1127
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,440
Okay, no, I can just walk around.

1128
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,440
Okay, that's fine.

1129
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,440
Right, what are we doing here a little bit?

1130
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,440
Oh my god, camera, please, I'm begging.

1131
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,440
Oh!

1132
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,440
Do not gamble, kids.

1133
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,440
What the heck?

1134
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
Do not gamble.

1135
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,440
Don't come.

1136
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,440
Literally, what the fuck?

1137
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,440
You know, the normal, like, penalty

1138
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,440
for, you know, losing to an...

1139
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,440
Oh my god, camera, please, I'm begging.

1140
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Why is it reversed?

1141
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,440
I'm on my hands and knees!

1142
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,440
Why were the games obsessed

1143
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,440
with reverse camera angle back then?

1144
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,440
He's hitting the gritty on the button.

1145
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,440
Sorry.

1146
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,440
Please, right, okay, there's a bit of gold over here,

1147
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,440
which we're going to need

1148
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,440
for where we're going.

1149
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,440
I think I might need a better, like, sucker...

1150
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,440
I can't see.

1151
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,440
I hear someone else.

1152
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Okay, you take two, which is fine.

1153
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,440
Give him a second, let him get up, let him get up.

1154
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,440
Let him get up. Go.

1155
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,440
Okay.

1156
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,440
We're doing it!

1157
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,440
We're doing it!

1158
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
Let's go gambling.

1159
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,440
Aw, dang it.

1160
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Let's open up a VTuber agency.

1161
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,440
Aw, dang it.

1162
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Aw, dang it.

1163
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Aw, dang it.

1164
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,440
And it's like, art is going past deadlines.

1165
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,440
You've been very specific on...

1166
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Oh, you can't finish...

1167
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,440
I didn't know that!

1168
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,440
I don't know if you've not perished everyone.

1169
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,440
Oh, my goodness.

1170
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,440
Is there, like, a secret we can access from up here?

1171
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,440
I looked like the...

1172
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,440
This one?

1173
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,440
I mean, this one looks pretty straightforward.

1174
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,440
And by straightforward, I mean,

1175
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,440
just move straightforward.

1176
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
Okay, we did it!

1177
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,440
We got a secret cap metal.

1178
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,440
It's as simple as just walking over to it.

1179
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,440
Love me games when they're simple like that.

1180
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,440
Mandatory...

1181
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
Literally,

1182
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,440
you have to, like, perish everyone in the area?

1183
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,440
Clear time, 6 minutes.

1184
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,440
Rank D!

1185
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,440
Who the fuck is doing this in, like, under 3 minutes?

1186
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,440
It's gonna be so f...

1187
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,440
There's, like, freaking so many things as well.

1188
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,440
We made 300 bucks.

1189
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,440
Oh, the ball is worth 100 G.

1190
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,440
It looks like we can also get

1191
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,440
5 more ammo slots.

1192
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,440
Oh, my God, we might actually get the red ones.

1193
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,440
I'm just so good at this game.

1194
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,440
Let's open an agency.

1195
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,440
Three times the work.

1196
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,440
No sleep. Ah, dang it.

1197
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,440
I have to worry about the others.

1198
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,440
Ah, dang it.

1199
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,440
I have to make sure that everyone's happy.

1200
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,440
So they'll sign on next year.

1201
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,440
Ah, dang it.

1202
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,440
Literally.

1203
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,440
Can't sleep for 8 hours anymore.

1204
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,440
Ah, dang it.

1205
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,440
Okay, there must be a secret back here.

1206
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,440
No!

1207
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,440
No!

1208
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,440
Oh, my God, it's the forbidden...

1209
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Oh, look at the detail in this game.

1210
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,440
He's like,

1211
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,440
I'm about to fall over.

1212
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,440
I sure hope I don't need a rescuing.

1213
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,440
Can't really watch, but have a great stream to join me.

1214
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Thank you, Reefling.

1215
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,440
I hope you have fun with what you're doing.

1216
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,440
Right, I have full...

1217
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,440
I have one slowdown

1218
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,440
and two reverse.

1219
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,440
Reverse. Reverse. Reverse.

1220
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,440
Right, we must perish all enemies.

1221
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,440
You are an enemy of the state.

1222
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,440
You will perish.

1223
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,440
Oh, well, I guess we're picking up that gem.

1224
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,440
Actually, I don't know what the green circle does.

1225
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,440
I don't think it's paws.

1226
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,440
What does the green circle do?

1227
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,440
It's very specific.

1228
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,440
Okay, I think we might need

1229
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,440
the bigger vacuum.

1230
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,440
There's like, so...

1231
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,440
those 16 ton things

1232
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,440
are getting pretty...

1233
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,440
That's what I'm supposed to hit.

1234
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,440
Okay, okay, new mechanic

1235
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,440
need to hit the thing.

1236
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,440
How's the game going?

1237
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,440
It's a good game, but I'm getting worried.

1238
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,440
That's all I'm saying. I'm getting a bit worried.

1239
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,440
Getting a bit worried that I'm not going to

1240
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,440
be able to do it.

1241
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,440
Getting a bit scared.

1242
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,440
It's a bit scary.

1243
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Right, we're going to try and go for hearts

1244
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,440
very carefully.

1245
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,440
I just wasted those hearts.

1246
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,440
That's rather frustrating.

1247
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,440
I have to admit, that's rather frustrating

1248
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,440
that those hearts get wasted

1249
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,440
because I kinda need more health, but that's okay.

1250
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,440
Right, who is here?

1251
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,440
Okay, I have a door behind me.

1252
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,440
So...

1253
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,440
Oh, no, it's a bridge.

1254
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,440
Okay.

1255
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Okay, you first.

1256
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,440
You first.

1257
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,440
You next.

1258
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,440
Oh my god, I'm just...

1259
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Just...

1260
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,440
Put me in, coach. Put me in.

1261
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,440
I don't know why you have others on the map.

1262
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,440
Put me in. I am that cat.

1263
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,440
Okay?

1264
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,440
I am that cat.

1265
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,440
Motherfucker.

1266
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Because...

1267
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,440
I don't know who you think I'm not.

1268
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,440
Ooh, enemy over there.

1269
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,440
And there's something under the bridge. I'm guessing.

1270
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,440
I'm guessing.

1271
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,440
Can we do this?

1272
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,440
I'm guessing.

1273
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Let's do this one.

1274
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,440
Hit him with the... Oh shit, wait.

1275
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,440
Why am I slow?

1276
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,440
Oh dear.

1277
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,440
Oh dear. I wasn't supposed to be this slow.

1278
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
When does it finish? It finishes right now.

1279
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,440
Oh dear, right? Well, I'm getting kablamo'd.

1280
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,440
Oh wait, they don't hurt me like that.

1281
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,440
Aw, freaking sick. I just did all of that for nothing.

1282
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,440
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not a fight right now.

1283
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,440
I'm not ready. I'm genuinely not ready

1284
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,440
for a fight right now. Please.

1285
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,440
Okay, you.

1286
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,440
Stop, stop. You're panicking me.

1287
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,440
There's also an enemy over there.

1288
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,440
Ah!

1289
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,440
What was... What am I to do?

1290
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,440
Right, he's away. That's fine. It doesn't matter.

1291
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,440
Jeez.

1292
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,440
This game is so stressful.

1293
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,440
Right, do that. That's fine. Two monsters to go.

1294
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,440
What's this?

1295
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,440
What do you do? Oh, you're a fast forward.

1296
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,440
Oh, no, you're not.

1297
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,440
Because these are money. Money.

1298
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,440
Money. Oh, it's the heart.

1299
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,440
That's fine.

1300
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,440
Okay, give me the heart.

1301
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,440
Give me the heart.

1302
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,440
And then, if we get all hearts,

1303
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,440
I get two extra lives. Surely that's how it works.

1304
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,440
Okay.

1305
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,440
The gamble machine.

1306
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,440
I'm not ready.

1307
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,440
Absolutely blur it.

1308
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,440
It's down here.

1309
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,440
Is this a secret?

1310
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,440
It looks like it.

1311
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Hmm. I don't know.

1312
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,440
Maybe it's just a weird design detail.

1313
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,440
Okay, let's get some more ammo.

1314
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,440
You should go gambling.

1315
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,440
I will pop on Balatruel right now.

1316
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,440
Don't think I won't.

1317
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,440
Right, let's pick this up.

1318
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,440
And then, let's get ready to run away from the bombs.

1319
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,440
I can't believe they were teaching us that

1320
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,440
Gamba... Oh!

1321
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,440
I can't believe they were teaching us

1322
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,440
that Gamba are real bad.

1323
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,440
Okay, what do we want?

1324
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,440
We can only really meet

1325
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,440
stars. It's always stars.

1326
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,440
There's two more enemies.

1327
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,440
Enemies. Gotta let it in the mood.

1328
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,440
I get two more reverses.

1329
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,440
Reverse. Reverse.

1330
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,440
Oh, I can do a pause, right? Let's do a pause.

1331
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,440
Shit.

1332
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,440
Okay, I hate this game.

1333
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,440
Been so dramatic!

1334
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,440
What? I'm supposed to...

1335
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,440
Oh, wait. Can I make another heart? Am I dumb?

1336
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,440
No, there's only two there.

1337
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,440
Every addiction story.

1338
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,440
Let's get a success. Oh, dang it.

1339
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,440
I had a really rough Balatruel.

1340
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,440
I had it really rough

1341
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,440
the last time we played Balatruel.

1342
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,440
Sorry, I keep doing that. Stop pressing B.

1343
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:54,440
You understand?

1344
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,440
Stop it. Keep your finger off B.

1345
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,440
No, don't do it.

1346
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,440
One more monster to go.

1347
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,440
Okay.

1348
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,440
But where is it?

1349
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,440
Down in the sewers.

1350
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,440
Every addiction

1351
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,440
starts somewhere.

1352
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,440
Somewhere else starts.

1353
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,440
Wait.

1354
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,440
I just went the wrong way.

1355
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,440
Wait, no. This opened up.

1356
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Who am I missing?

1357
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,440
So this was a doorway to get up to here.

1358
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,440
Okay, copium.

1359
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,440
And where did I go from here?

1360
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,440
Where did I go?

1361
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,440
Did I miss?

1362
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,440
Uh, brain?

1363
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,440
Brain?

1364
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,440
Brain?

1365
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,440
99 gamers quit before they make a big stop.

1366
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,440
We're going to be encouraging people.

1367
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:58,440
Oh, okay. There was a little path.

1368
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,440
Okay, okay.

1369
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,440
We're doing it. We're doing it.

1370
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,440
Okay, where is this enemy?

1371
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,440
There you are, ya bam.

1372
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,440
Oh, I missed. There you are, ya bam.

1373
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,440
No, don't suck it in.

1374
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,440
No. Take the bomb.

1375
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,440
Give him the bomb.

1376
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,440
Hurry to the gold gate.

1377
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,440
Yeah, what happens if I don't?

1378
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,440
Okay, we get money.

1379
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,440
Can we access

1380
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,440
anything here?

1381
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,440
I don't want to jump down

1382
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,440
and go all the way around again.

1383
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Oh, there was money over there.

1384
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,440
The point that the monster fell in the water.

1385
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,440
Oh no, it respawned in front of me.

1386
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,440
How much? 500?

1387
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,440
200?

1388
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,440
No, give me all the money.

1389
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,440
I got 700 for that.

1390
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,440
That's not bad. That's not bad.

1391
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,440
Okay, we're doing the boss fight.

1392
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,440
We're doing the boss fight.

1393
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,440
I'm sure this will be easy.

1394
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,440
The music is very funky.

1395
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,440
It is very funky.

1396
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,440
I definitely would like more ammo, I think.

1397
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:26,440
I'm getting nervous.

1398
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,440
Is there anything special behind me?

1399
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,440
No.

1400
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,440
Okay, boss time.

1401
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,440
Copium.

1402
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,440
Copium, boss time.

1403
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,440
Okay.

1404
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,440
Analysing.

1405
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,440
Okay, he eats what I get.

1406
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,440
I just made him so much bigger.

1407
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,440
Right, how do I hit you?

1408
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,440
Let us observe the attack pattern

1409
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,440
of the enemy.

1410
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,440
Okay, I've just made him bigger.

1411
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
Oh my god!

1412
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,440
This is literally an inflation game.

1413
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,440
I don't...

1414
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,440
How do I attack him?

1415
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,440
How do I hit him in the back?

1416
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,440
It is not possible.

1417
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,440
How do I...

1418
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,440
Yeah, he's so quick.

1419
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,440
I don't...

1420
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,440
Wait, hold on.

1421
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,440
I'm going to let him charge me again.

1422
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,440
But I'm going to be so brave

1423
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,440
and let him charge me.

1424
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,440
No, you need to do the stinky charge effect.

1425
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,440
Hold on.

1426
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,440
No, you need to do the charge.

1427
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,440
Do the charge.

1428
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,440
I'm going to stand my ground and wallop him.

1429
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,440
Bruh.

1430
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,440
Bruh.

1431
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,440
Do I need to be right next to him?

1432
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,440
Yeah, this.

1433
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,440
Yeah, I think that's when I'm supposed to get him.

1434
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,440
No?

1435
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,440
Keep making him bigger till he blows up.

1436
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,440
I don't know, maybe pause.

1437
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,440
I don't have pause.

1438
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,440
I don't have anything. I have rewind.

1439
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,440
But that's like useless.

1440
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,440
The entire map is going to be filled with...

1441
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,440
Right, so he's going to jump.

1442
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,440
Right, well, I think

1443
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,440
it's when he jumps.

1444
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,440
I think.

1445
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,440
I think, I think, I think. I think it's when he jumps.

1446
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,440
Okay, I think it's when he jumps.

1447
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,440
He needs to do the gas attack

1448
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,440
and then I basically need to stand my ground.

1449
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,440
I think he locks on to wherever

1450
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,440
he starts the gas attack.

1451
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,440
So I can turn around

1452
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,440
and hit him.

1453
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,440
I just need him to do the gas attack

1454
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,440
when I'm ready for him.

1455
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,440
Okay, okay, okay.

1456
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,440
No.

1457
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,440
Okay.

1458
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,440
Maybe not quite

1459
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,440
how I was hoping for that to go.

1460
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,440
Can you suck up the stuff he shoots?

1461
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,440
Yeah.

1462
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
That's what my ammo is.

1463
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,440
He's given me ammo to hurt him, but...

1464
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,440
Uh, I didn't work.

1465
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,440
Probably need the crystals in the middle.

1466
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,440
I can't make anything with the crystals.

1467
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,440
I need a combination.

1468
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,440
I don't have combination.

1469
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,440
Right, no.

1470
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,440
That wasn't it?

1471
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,440
What?

1472
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,440
How is that not it?

1473
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,440
Oh, Reflanks.

1474
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,440
Can someone look up Blinks Walkthrough Tutorial

1475
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,440
Second Boss

1476
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,440
and deja vu

1477
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,440
location name.

1478
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,440
I don't know what the heck I'm supposed to do.

1479
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,440
I can't figure it out. Look, he jumps

1480
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,440
and then he turns around to instantly

1481
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,440
eat what I'm going to give him.

1482
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,440
Oh, I just picked that up by accident.

1483
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,440
Wait.

1484
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,440
I don't know.

1485
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,440
Maybe I'm supposed to jump up here.

1486
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,440
Oh, I can't.

1487
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,440
I'm just wasting all my ammo and panicking.

1488
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,440
Okay, that's fair.

1489
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,440
Inflation. Maybe just need combination.

1490
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,440
Do, do, no, go strategy.

1491
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,440
Shoot stuff.

1492
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,440
I don't know this game, but I suspect throw something

1493
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,440
in his big, wide mouth.

1494
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,440
What is it? Just blow him up

1495
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,440
by making him eat?

1496
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,440
Like, he's literally immune

1497
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,440
when he jumps, so it can't be that.

1498
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,440
It can only be

1499
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,440
hit the back in size.

1500
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,440
I can only hit his back.

1501
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,440
So all he did, I literally

1502
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,440
just got done twice in a row.

1503
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,440
What happens if I fail a mission?

1504
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,440
Oh, dear.

1505
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,440
Oh, no. Don't hit him from the front.

1506
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,440
He just eats it. Use the pause

1507
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,440
to hit him from the side.

1508
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,440
Does he, like, give...

1509
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,440
I don't have a pause.

1510
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
I only have Rewind.

1511
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,440
I'm not really sure how I'm supposed

1512
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,440
to utilize Rewind. I'm going to be on it.

1513
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,440
I don't...

1514
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,440
Am I supposed to go into that fight?

1515
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,440
Like...

1516
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,440
But if I lose all my progress...

1517
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,440
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1518
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,440
Mm-hmm.

1519
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,440
Mm-hmm. That's what I thought.

1520
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,440
Hold on besties.

1521
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,440
For no particular reason...

1522
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,440
For no particular reason...

1523
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,440
For no particular reason

1524
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,440
I am going to just

1525
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,440
type something in a YouTube...

1526
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,440
No, whoa.

1527
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Your accusations?

1528
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,440
No.

1529
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,440
Your accusations? I don't know what you're thinking

1530
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,440
that I'm doing right now in the background.

1531
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,440
I've not got clues. Seriously, I've not...

1532
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,440
Well, you hear something

1533
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,440
in the back. No, you don't.

1534
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,440
No, you don't. You don't hear a thing

1535
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,440
in the background right now.

1536
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,440
Hold on.

1537
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,440
I don't know what you hear in the background,

1538
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,440
but it's not

1539
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,440
what you think it is.

1540
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,440
It's not what you think it is.

1541
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,440
Uh...

1542
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,440
I'm just thinking, yeah, there's audio issues,

1543
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,440
like, things are... Oh my god, that guy

1544
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,440
has collected so many things.

1545
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,440
Okay.

1546
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,440
Right, for no reason,

1547
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,440
you can hear the same boss music

1548
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,440
but sped up in the background.

1549
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,440
That's perfectly natural.

1550
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,440
Uh-huh.

1551
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,440
Okay, he doesn't have a pause on him.

1552
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,440
Is that simple?

1553
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,440
Is that simple?

1554
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,440
Right, so, you know the term

1555
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,440
making a mountain out of a mole hill?

1556
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,440
May

1557
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,440
or may not.

1558
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,440
This is... There's nothing stopping

1559
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,440
you better try to click. Everything on the map.

1560
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,440
I don't know.

1561
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,440
I don't... There's not many games

1562
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,440
that inspire me to go... Right.

1563
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,440
Okay, now, if this doesn't work

1564
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,440
after I've just done that, I'm going to be embarrassed.

1565
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,440
But...

1566
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,440
the guy basically did this. He went up to...

1567
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,440
Okay, he went up to...

1568
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,440
Uh-huh.

1569
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,440
Okay.

1570
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,440
Oh, piss.

1571
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,440
Bro, how is this guy so good?

1572
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,440
Right.

1573
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,440
I'm gonna please leave him alone.

1574
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,440
Can he come up here? Okay, is this respite?

1575
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,440
Alright, I'll take it.

1576
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,440
Hold X for item.

1577
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,440
Okay, five ammo again.

1578
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,440
Uh, right, okay.

1579
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,440
How does that guy do it so good though?

1580
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,440
Yeah, two of us can jump, bitch.

1581
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,440
Oh, fuck's sake, hold on.

1582
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:34,440
Oh, shit, I'm still in game.

1583
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,440
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1584
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,440
How did he do that?

1585
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,440
Don't, don't judge me!

1586
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,440
You can stay on the platform and just shoot

1587
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,440
when he shows his back. Wait, real stress?

1588
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,440
In 4k?

1589
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,440
How did he go around?

1590
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,440
He literally entered... Right.

1591
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,440
Not that I'm looking at someone playing the game right now.

1592
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:58,440
But if I was,

1593
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,440
in theory, the guy literally

1594
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,440
enters the arena, goes to the left,

1595
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,440
the monster looks away

1596
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,440
and he gets him in the arse.

1597
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,440
But if I do that, he eats it.

1598
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:16,440
Oh, he goes and gets a pause.

1599
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,440
Alright, okay, maybe.

1600
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,440
Oh my god, stop, I'm gonna die.

1601
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,440
Again!

1602
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,440
Stop, I'm embarrassed, I'm actually embarrassed.

1603
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,440
I can't believe I'm cheatsy doodling.

1604
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,440
Stop, I need a freakin' pause.

1605
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,440
And not of...

1606
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,440
Right, you, yeah, bam.

1607
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Right, that was my opportunity.

1608
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,440
I'm like, 90% sure that was my opportunity.

1609
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,440
Right, okay. Okay, boom, no.

1610
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,440
Yeah.

1611
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,440
Okay, it's stopped locked by a child game.

1612
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,440
Fuck you, bitch.

1613
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,440
No, that was my fucking chance.

1614
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,440
Stop it, you're bullying me.

1615
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,440
Hey, I told you you can bully children, you weirdo.

1616
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,440
I'm literally,

1617
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,440
I'm literally, this is who you're bullying.

1618
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,440
I'm just a little hamster.

1619
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,440
Alright, he went small again, I'll take it.

1620
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,440
Oh my god, he's farting even more than usual.

1621
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,440
Stop it, I'm just...

1622
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Stop eating everything I'm giving you.

1623
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,440
Right, I need to go beat him up.

1624
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,440
Right, come...

1625
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,440
Yes, no!

1626
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,440
Are you serious, you frickin'...

1627
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,440
You frickin' frick...

1628
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,440
You know exactly what you did.

1629
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,440
You know exactly what you did.

1630
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
No, I'm gonna miss.

1631
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,440
No, that should have hit.

1632
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,440
How am I supposed to play this?

1633
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,440
How am I supposed to play this?

1634
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,440
Please.

1635
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,440
Fuck, yeah, I'm aware.

1636
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,440
I'm aware, I'm aware, I'm aware, I'm aware.

1637
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,440
And he was immune.

1638
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,440
And he was immune?

1639
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,440
Of course he was immune.

1640
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,440
I know I have no fucking ammo.

1641
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:18,440
Oh my god, no, I can't do this, I can't do this.

1642
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,440
Put me on combo, combo.

1643
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,440
Put me on Halo Combat Evolved, come on.

1644
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,440
Come on, put me on Halo, come on.

1645
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,440
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!

1646
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,440
Put me on Halo right now.

1647
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,440
Put me on Halo right now.

1648
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,440
Put me on Legendary Halo.

1649
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,440
I'll do that 10k challenge right now.

1650
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,440
It'll be easier than this frickin' boss fight, I'm not even kidding.

1651
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,440
Right, and then he's gonna turn around.

1652
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,440
And then he's gonna keep going for me.

1653
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,440
Right, hold on, I need to go on that platform

1654
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,440
and pick up some ammo,

1655
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,440
because I am out.

1656
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,440
Now, don't you be...

1657
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,440
Don't you be looking at me with your wee

1658
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,440
wizardy things.

1659
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,440
Yeah, you can jump me all you want,

1660
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,440
but I'll be the one jumping you.

1661
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,440
Oh, come on!

1662
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,440
He turns around and does that all the time.

1663
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,440
Is he big enough that he can shoot me from here?

1664
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,440
This game is literally Dark Souls.

1665
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,440
Okay.

1666
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,440
You need to go small

1667
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,440
before I can even fight you.

1668
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,440
I have one health, I need him to barf out

1669
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,440
and get smaller, because this is impossible.

1670
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,440
I need him?

1671
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,440
No.

1672
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,440
You're just diving.

1673
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,440
Your hitbox is massive,

1674
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,440
and it's gonna hit me.

1675
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,440
Not you. It's not gonna be a benefit.

1676
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,440
I don't wanna go down and fight.

1677
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,440
You're too big!

1678
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,440
This game is Dark Souls,

1679
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,440
but if it was actually hard.

1680
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,440
Real and true!

1681
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,440
Go small!

1682
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:56,440
Okay.

1683
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,440
I'm gonna balls it up,

1684
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,440
but I'll balls it up.

1685
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,440
Because...

1686
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,440
And he's gonna turn around.

1687
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,440
Yep.

1688
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,440
And he's gonna come closer.

1689
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,440
I don't know how I'm supposed to get yet,

1690
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,440
so you're too big right now.

1691
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,440
I literally cannot do anything about your

1692
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,440
fricking size, and you'll do a big jump

1693
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,440
and then I've not got time to do anything.

1694
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,440
I'm gonna fucking...

1695
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,440
Please stop billing!

1696
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,440
No!

1697
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,440
Please stop billing me!

1698
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,440
I'm a literal child!

1699
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,440
Oh, and then that was the perfect time

1700
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,440
to probably wallop him.

1701
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,440
And I missed it!

1702
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,440
Stop!

1703
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:42,440
How much can I give you up as a child?

1704
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,440
But when I win, I'll be super happy, though.

1705
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:48,440
But right now, I'm misery

1706
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,440
and carny.

1707
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,440
I'm carny now, I'm gonna fucking be happy.

1708
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,440
No! Stop it!

1709
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,440
Stop turning around!

1710
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,440
Stop turning around!

1711
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,440
Stop it!

1712
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,440
Stop getting bigger!

1713
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,440
I can't!

1714
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,440
I suck so bad!

1715
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,440
I'm literally sweating right now.

1716
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
I'm so scared!

1717
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,440
And I can't...

1718
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,440
Oh, and maybe he goes tiny.

1719
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,440
Stop sucking up things

1720
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,440
that don't help links!

1721
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,440
Suck up the ammo!

1722
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,440
So we have a chance!

1723
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,440
I literally can't do this.

1724
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,440
I'm so scared!

1725
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,440
I need one of you guys

1726
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,440
to go on the fucking software

1727
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,440
so you can go on my PC

1728
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,440
and do this boss fight for me!

1729
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,440
I can!

1730
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,440
I can!

1731
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,440
I can!

1732
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,440
I'm actually gonna fucking suck lots!

1733
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,440
It's only the second boss!

1734
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,440
It's only the second boss

1735
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,440
which makes us ten times worse.

1736
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
I thought this was for we kids!

1737
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,440
How did you eat that?

1738
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,440
That was a 90 degree angle!

1739
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,440
90 degree angle!

1740
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,440
Oh my god!

1741
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,440
I'm not gonna make it.

1742
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,440
I'm actually not gonna make it.

1743
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,440
I'm getting...

1744
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,440
Okay, I regret.

1745
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,440
I should have picked a better game choice.

1746
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,440
I admit it, Reflin's okay. I'm the dumb one.

1747
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,440
Please!

1748
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,440
Please! AI, please!

1749
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,440
I'm literally gonna perish.

1750
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,440
There's so much furniture.

1751
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,440
I literally cannot even do a circle around him.

1752
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,440
There's like so much furniture

1753
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,440
in the way to try and do this like circle thing.

1754
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,440
Where I shoot him in the side!

1755
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,440
Oh my god! Blink!

1756
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,440
Blink!

1757
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,440
Blink!

1758
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,440
Starlin!

1759
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,440
Blinks! Why is it you auto lock

1760
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,440
on literally everything else?

1761
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,440
But the one time it was the perfect auto lock.

1762
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,440
He goes,

1763
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,440
mmm, is the enemy left,

1764
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,440
right, fucking up my arse?

1765
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,440
Blinks! Come on!

1766
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,440
You knew exactly

1767
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,440
what you were supposed to do.

1768
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,440
Okay, let's try that again.

1769
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,440
That was like our closest we have ever came.

1770
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,440
Okay?

1771
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,440
And he's so big, his hitbox is massive

1772
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,440
and I can hardly do anything with it.

1773
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,440
Okay, okay, okay,

1774
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,440
okay, okay, okay. Don't give up.

1775
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,440
Don't give up.

1776
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,440
Don't give up.

1777
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,440
Don't give up.

1778
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,440
Don't give up.

1779
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,440
Don't give him.

1780
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,440
Don't give him.

1781
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,440
So I'll take him a little to the left.

1782
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,440
Okay, I'm dead.

1783
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,440
Oh my gosh!

1784
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,440
Right, put me back in, chief. Put me back in.

1785
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,440
Put me back in, chief.

1786
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,440
Put me back in.

1787
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:02,440
I'm not having this. I'm actually not having this.

1788
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,440
I've been bullied about an old freaking game.

1789
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,440
I'm literally sweating.

1790
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,440
I have so much sweat on me right now.

1791
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,440
And before anyone asks what colour of my pants are,

1792
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,440
no, I'm not wearing any right now.

1793
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,440
I can't marinate for three days

1794
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,440
in the same underwear so I'm wearing nothing.

1795
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,440
Okay, come on, come on.

1796
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,440
We can do this, right?

1797
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
And we already know

1798
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,440
the game gives us a free pause, okay?

1799
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,440
We already know the game gives us a free pause.

1800
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,440
We are going to utilise it.

1801
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:34,440
Okay, but first we're going to beat him up.

1802
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,440
So he's going to do a weird thing here.

1803
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,440
Nope, no he's not.

1804
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,440
He didn't do it. I was expecting him to do it.

1805
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,440
Okay, that's when he's going to do the thing

1806
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,440
and he's going to hit us.

1807
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,440
He used to like come to the wall.

1808
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,440
What do you want from me?

1809
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,440
What do you want from me?

1810
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,440
What do you want from me? Seriously, seriously?

1811
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,440
Do it. What do you want?

1812
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,440
What do you want?

1813
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
What do you want?

1814
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,440
Is this game produced for children?

1815
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,440
Because it's really

1816
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,440
no giving me the impression

1817
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,440
that a wane could do this.

1818
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,440
No wonder I never got to the...

1819
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,440
Go in! Go in the actual door as a favour.

1820
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,440
Go in the actual door as a favour.

1821
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,440
Die.

1822
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,440
It...

1823
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,440
You can't make this up.

1824
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,440
He's invincible.

1825
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,440
He's invincible.

1826
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,440
He's invincible.

1827
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,440
He's invincible.

1828
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,440
You can't make it up.

1829
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,440
I wasted my pause on that.

1830
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,440
Bruv, I'm actually getting...

1831
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,440
And I missed.

1832
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,440
Okay.

1833
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,440
One, whoever the director

1834
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,440
of this game is.

1835
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,440
Your mum's a hoe.

1836
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,440
Two, whoever designed this level.

1837
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,440
Your dad wanks on all fours.

1838
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,440
Your dad wanks on all fours.

1839
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,440
Free.

1840
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,440
Whoever designed this particular boss.

1841
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,440
You shag your cousin on the weekend.

1842
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,440
I'm going to lose it.

1843
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,440
I'm actually going to lose it.

1844
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,440
I'm going to lose it. Everybody get to it.

1845
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:22,440
Do it.

1846
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,440
Let's see this frog is jumping.

1847
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,440
The walls, he won't stop pumping.

1848
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,440
You know, forever.

1849
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,440
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1850
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,440
Let the hate flow through you.

1851
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,440
Let the hate

1852
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,440
flow through you.

1853
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,440
Chancellor Palpatine.

1854
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,440
Chancellor...

1855
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,440
I...

1856
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,440
I call upon you Chancellor Palpatine.

1857
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,440
Please.

1858
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,440
Please.

1859
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,440
Please, let the freaking

1860
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,440
dark side flow through me.

1861
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,440
Because what the...

1862
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,440
Fuck.

1863
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:58,440
It's 5 a.m.

1864
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,440
Please.

1865
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,440
Please just let me win.

1866
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,440
It's first thing in the morning.

1867
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,440
Oh my god.

1868
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,440
It's first thing in the morning.

1869
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:16,440
Please, it's a child's game.

1870
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:20,440
Please.

1871
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,440
It's a child's

1872
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,440
child's

1873
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,440
game.

1874
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,440
Why would you ask for friend

1875
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,440
perfect mechanics

1876
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,440
from 5 year olds?

1877
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,440
Please.

1878
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,440
He's so big I can't

1879
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,440
navigate around the furniture.

1880
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,440
Go

1881
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,440
here.

1882
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:44,440
No, don't jump.

1883
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,440
Don't jump.

1884
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,440
Stop it. I literally can't

1885
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:50,440
get around to me so big.

1886
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,440
Please.

1887
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,440
Please.

1888
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,440
Oh my god.

1889
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,440
Don't...

1890
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,440
I have zero chance.

1891
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,440
I have zero chance of completing this game.

1892
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,440
I am just telling you all now.

1893
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,440
I have fucking zero chance.

1894
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,440
There's no way.

1895
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:10,440
And to add insult to

1896
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,440
injury, you can't even keep the goal

1897
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,440
that you get at the end.

1898
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,440
Why?

1899
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,440
Why?

1900
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,440
Why?

1901
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,440
Am I going mental?

1902
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,440
Am I going mental?

1903
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:28,440
This is for

1904
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,440
wanes. This is for children

1905
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,440
who have not even got

1906
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,440
hand eye coordination yet.

1907
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,440
What was that fate?

1908
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:38,440
This is literally the first Dark Souls.

1909
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,440
Thank you. I'm so sorry I had to hear that.

1910
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,440
Bruh.

1911
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,440
There's

1912
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:46,440
no way in hell we're completing this game.

1913
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,440
I am warning you

1914
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,440
now.

1915
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,440
It is not happening.

1916
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,440
We're going to get stuck somewhere.

1917
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,440
I don't know where. I'm looking ahead at this guy

1918
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,440
playing this game.

1919
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,440
There's apparently

1920
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,440
eight levels.

1921
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:04,440
We're entering level three

1922
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,440
and I was stuck on

1923
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,440
the motherfucking thing. Oh, it's the water level.

1924
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,440
It's the water.

1925
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,440
It's me. This is my house.

1926
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,440
Oh.

1927
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,440
And there's glowing mushrooms.

1928
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,440
You're making me think of the water.

1929
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,440
Bruh.

1930
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,440
Right.

1931
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,440
I literally can't even see the enemies.

1932
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,440
Okay. And then you're next.

1933
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,440
Yabam. Right. Who's next?

1934
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,440
Oh, he has extra health.

1935
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,440
He's still alive.

1936
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,440
Okay. Let's do that.

1937
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,440
Get the juice.

1938
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,440
Let's suck some things up

1939
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,440
for some ammo.

1940
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,440
This game may cause

1941
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,440
a loss of sanity.

1942
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,440
You know what?

1943
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,440
I'm actually going to say

1944
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,440
true and real.

1945
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,440
Let's get some heart.

1946
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,440
They never drop a heart when you want them to.

1947
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,440
Oh, they did though.

1948
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,440
No. Do not pick up another one or I'll cry.

1949
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,440
I hear a lot bouncing off

1950
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,440
ahead.

1951
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,440
Oh, they're guarding

1952
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,440
a little treasure chest.

1953
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:16,440
No. Why?

1954
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,440
Wait. Are there enemies

1955
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,440
that pop out at me now?

1956
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,440
One's a busty crust station.

1957
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,440
And one's a crusty bust station.

1958
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,440
There's something in here.

1959
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,440
Oh.

1960
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,440
Oh, my God. It's actually Dark Souls real.

1961
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,440
Oh, stop. You're scaring me.

1962
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,440
It's chasing me.

1963
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,440
Stop it. Are you coded to come in here?

1964
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,440
Be honest.

1965
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,440
You're stuck at the coded doorway.

1966
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,440
Damn right.

1967
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:46,440
You're stuck at the doorway.

1968
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,440
That's right. You better respawn back there, you little bitch.

1969
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1970
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,440
Okay. I love games.

1971
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:54,440
Do more of that, please.

1972
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,440
This makes me happy.

1973
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:00,440
Wait. There's another boss identical to it.

1974
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:02,440
Please don't say such

1975
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,440
things. I'm just going to pretend

1976
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,440
I didn't read that and you're actually just trolling

1977
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,440
and there isn't a boss that's identical to that

1978
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,440
frog and they didn't

1979
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,440
do that to me because

1980
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,440
why would you do that to me?

1981
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,440
I can't suck up that chest to take...

1982
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,440
Oh!

1983
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,440
See this game.

1984
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,440
See this game when it like picks up crystals

1985
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,440
if anyone's hit them.

1986
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,440
Please read all over me.

1987
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,440
Honestly.

1988
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:34,440
Bruh.

1989
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,440
The wings...

1990
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,440
Man, wasn't there not

1991
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,440
somewhere else that I could explore back here as well?

1992
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,440
Wait, it's all just frogs?

1993
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,440
No, don't. I will literally

1994
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,440
have nightmares tonight. Okay.

1995
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,440
Wait, I can't progress to kill the enemies

1996
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,440
on the other side?

1997
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,440
Wait, did I need to go to the shop?

1998
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,440
Can I not do this level?

1999
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,440
I might not be able to do this

2000
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,440
level.

2001
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,440
If we can't

2002
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,440
lift up that stuff from the shop.

2003
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,440
Oh my god, we have a health.

2004
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,440
A Christmas Markle.

2005
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,440
Just wait till you get to the next block.

2006
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,440
The tiers are going to be great. Stop!

2007
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,440
Literally harder than Elden Ring.

2008
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,440
You just despawned

2009
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,440
out of nowhere. Oh, and...

2010
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,440
Apparently we're not aim bottom now.

2011
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,440
Lovely.

2012
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,440
Oh, ah, okay.

2013
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,440
Oh, I'm getting jumped. I'm getting jumped.

2014
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,440
Blinks! Yeah, move on, buddy.

2015
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:34,440
Yeah, move on. We need to pick up more ammo.

2016
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,440
We're getting jumped. We're getting jumped!

2017
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,440
Can they come down here?

2018
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,440
I need more ammo.

2019
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,440
I need more things.

2020
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,440
Okay.

2021
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:50,440
Pick up some of the ammo.

2022
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,440
Okay, my health is full, so I actually

2023
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,440
don't need...

2024
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:58,440
There's another enemy here.

2025
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,440
Okay, you keep glitching out

2026
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,440
and it's making me nervous.

2027
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,440
Okay.

2028
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,440
Okay, that's fine.

2029
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,440
Right.

2030
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,440
What?

2031
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,440
A pause? I'll take a pause. I'm not going to lie.

2032
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,440
I think pauses are really handy,

2033
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,440
so I'll take the blue.

2034
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,440
And then...

2035
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,440
I still don't know what green does, but whatever it is.

2036
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,440
I'll happy, happy. Dark Souls,

2037
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,440
but with no rolling.

2038
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:26,440
I'm getting into the cameras and buried.

2039
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,440
Oh no, I don't...

2040
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,440
I can't see underneath!

2041
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,440
Goodness, gravy.

2042
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,440
This game.

2043
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,440
Okay.

2044
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,440
Oh my god, I didn't realize that had

2045
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,440
to come a bit closer to me.

2046
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,440
Stop, please don't shoot me.

2047
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,440
Okay, you go. You go!

2048
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,440
Oh my god, wait.

2049
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,440
These guys have two health.

2050
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,440
They're green though. Green's supposed to be one shot.

2051
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,440
Yellow's supposed to be...

2052
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:58,440
Oh god, it's the frickin' bomb frog.

2053
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:02,440
Where's the bomb?

2054
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,440
If it's the last enemy, I'm just going to pause

2055
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,440
and give him a big wallop right now.

2056
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,440
One wallop for you.

2057
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,440
And then where the heck is the bomb?

2058
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,440
Where's the bomb? I'm running away.

2059
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,440
I'm just hurting him and running away.

2060
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,440
Excuse me, pardon me, coming through and you go find the bomb.

2061
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,440
Okay.

2062
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,440
Sugar.

2063
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,440
There is no bomb.

2064
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,440
You have to catch him off guard.

2065
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,440
He's literally all locked to me though.

2066
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:36,440
I don't see the bomb.

2067
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,440
Did I walk past it? No, he's like locked onto me.

2068
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,440
Oh, I'm just going to have to go back

2069
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,440
and then...

2070
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,440
Shoot him in the back basically.

2071
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,440
Okay, that was lucky.

2072
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,440
That was lucky, yeah.

2073
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,440
Sorry, but that was.

2074
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,440
That shouldn't have gone through.

2075
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,440
Wait.

2076
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:04,440
Was there a green back here?

2077
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,440
There was, right, hold on.

2078
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,440
Out of raw curiosity, I want to see what green makes

2079
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,440
because I still don't know.

2080
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,440
A record?

2081
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,440
Oh, I can get the action shot.

2082
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,440
Use record to record and play

2083
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,440
back time.

2084
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,440
A copy of yourself repeats what you did.

2085
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,440
While you're being recorded, you're invincible.

2086
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,440
What am I?

2087
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,440
I can't even wrap my head around what on earth that means.

2088
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:28,440
I've just got...

2089
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,440
You're the bomb.

2090
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,440
Hit Cider back.

2091
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,440
Yeah, at least his hitbox was fair

2092
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,440
unlike someone else's in this game.

2093
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:38,440
Fucking hell.

2094
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,440
I'm like so sweaty after that boss fight.

2095
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,440
I'm so raging.

2096
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,440
But we did it. Okay, we're on level 3.

2097
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,440
Technically, we're about to be...

2098
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,440
If we finish and get on to stage 4,

2099
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,440
then we...

2100
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,440
What do we do?

2101
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,440
Reluctantly saying thank you for the tip.

2102
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,440
Sorry, I was so angry I didn't even read it.

2103
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:58,440
Enemy failed.

2104
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,440
Literally enemy failed.

2105
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:02,440
Record, do an attack, play it back

2106
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:04,440
with a copy and repeat.

2107
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,440
Okay.

2108
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,440
Okay.

2109
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,440
Okay.

2110
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,440
See, the problem is I have to

2111
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,440
actually hit the dying attack.

2112
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,440
Haha.

2113
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,440
I have to actually be...

2114
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,440
Oh my god, look at the enemies!

2115
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,440
How many is that?

2116
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,440
14 in one level?

2117
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:26,440
3.

2118
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,440
Is this Legend of Zelda?

2119
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,440
Oh no, you have to go through the waterfall.

2120
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,440
Okay, I thought I was going to be like...

2121
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,440
Oh, am I drowning?

2122
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,440
I hope not.

2123
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,440
Same box, 360 no scope.

2124
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,440
Okay, there's loads of noises going on.

2125
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,440
I don't like it, I can't see.

2126
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,440
Okay, I can't see, I can't see.

2127
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,440
I'll be the first to admit, I can't see.

2128
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:48,440
Am I being attacked?

2129
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,440
I don't know.

2130
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:52,440
Okay, you're next.

2131
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,440
Okay, you're next.

2132
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,440
Right, we'll do the pause.

2133
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,440
I'm happy to do the... Oh wait, no.

2134
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,440
I'm full.

2135
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:04,440
Well, I hope it gets rid of the reverse

2136
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,440
unless the stage like...

2137
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,440
forces it.

2138
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,440
If you know what I mean.

2139
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,440
Ooh, we just got render spawn distance.

2140
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,440
Did you see that?

2141
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,440
That's how... Oh my god, it's a platformer!

2142
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,440
Right, hold on, I'm picking up more ammo

2143
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,440
because I'm going to get a couple ammoed in the air.

2144
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,440
I can already see it now.

2145
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,440
The game's going to be like, here's a billion enemies

2146
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,440
in your face at once.

2147
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,440
Some shorts can come out of this game.

2148
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,440
I don't think so. This game is just misery

2149
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,440
and suffering. I'm not sure...

2150
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:34,440
I can produce a short that looks

2151
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:36,440
like anything

2152
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,440
remotely entertaining.

2153
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,440
I'm sorry, but whenever I...

2154
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,440
I just imagine, like, whenever I'm, like, raging.

2155
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,440
That is just rubbish.

2156
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,440
I don't care for money.

2157
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:54,440
I care for not getting walloped

2158
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,440
in a ram of enemies!

2159
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,440
Oh my god, there's so many of them.

2160
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,440
Okay, that's one.

2161
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:02,440
That's two.

2162
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,440
I'll survive.

2163
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,440
Use Scream and Plea.

2164
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:08,440
This is a child game.

2165
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,440
Please let me win. It's 5am.

2166
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,440
It's entertaining. Okay, is that it?

2167
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:14,440
I have no idea what I say in the moment

2168
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,440
when I rage. I just see red.

2169
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,440
I see red. I see red. I see red.

2170
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,440
It's just all...

2171
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:22,440
So, you have no idea

2172
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,440
how deep, how badly it goes inside.

2173
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,440
Sadly, it goes inside.

2174
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,440
What?

2175
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,440
Okay, then we'll do the full ammo.

2176
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,440
Technique, full ammo. Thank you.

2177
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,440
Right, our health is full. We have a pause, a rewind

2178
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,440
and a record for a double hit.

2179
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,440
So, I don't really think

2180
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:40,440
we necessarily have to do

2181
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,440
anything right now.

2182
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,440
We can do one more.

2183
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,440
Can I aim for him?

2184
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,440
I can!

2185
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,440
Not him becoming

2186
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,440
so flat in the sand.

2187
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,440
That's so cute.

2188
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,440
Still invincible.

2189
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,440
Yeah, do a little power away.

2190
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,440
You perish.

2191
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,440
Genetically encoded rage.

2192
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,440
Ancestral rage access.

2193
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,440
Oh, I thought the game

2194
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,440
just straight up kills you.

2195
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,440
Okay.

2196
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,440
How are you supposed to suck from over here?

2197
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:16,440
I don't know.

2198
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,440
Okay.

2199
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,440
Uh, right.

2200
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,440
We don't have full ammo,

2201
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,440
but we do know

2202
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,440
what kind of...

2203
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,440
Is this a throw?

2204
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,440
Okay, so two...

2205
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,440
Oh, UV bastard, I see you.

2206
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,440
Shit, I missed.

2207
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,440
Yeah, use your magic somewhere else, UV band.

2208
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,440
Camera angle.

2209
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,440
Again, really not helping,

2210
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,440
but I'll do what I can.

2211
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,440
I don't see a bomb for the throw.

2212
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,440
Okay, one of them.

2213
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,440
If I could just

2214
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:56,440
kind of perish the wee guys

2215
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,440
in the ground first.

2216
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,440
Eh, what a noise.

2217
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,440
What a sound effect, honestly.

2218
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,440
All right, pop out, pop out.

2219
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,440
These platforms making the same sense

2220
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,440
when you... Then you're strong, you audio...

2221
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,440
Go, go, go, go.

2222
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,440
Got one.

2223
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,440
I really don't want to

2224
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,440
mess up too badly.

2225
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:26,440
No.

2226
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:28,440
Come on, pop your head out.

2227
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:30,440
Come on.

2228
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:32,440
Come on, be a good enemy.

2229
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,440
Be a good enemy, or is he only going to pop his head out

2230
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,440
right next to the frog?

2231
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,440
Come on, AI, lock onto me.

2232
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,440
You know you want to...

2233
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,440
Do you see a little neckl?

2234
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,440
I don't want the frog to lock onto me,

2235
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,440
however, because he becomes quite

2236
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,440
a bit of a problem.

2237
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,440
Scottish Rage ASMR win.

2238
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,440
I mean, people seem to enjoy that meme

2239
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,440
where it's like knocking you out ASMR.

2240
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,440
If someone actually wants a parody,

2241
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,440
I will happily make a parody

2242
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,440
of me just like beating the shit out of the mic.

2243
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,440
I'm pretty sure you're supposed to use

2244
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:10,440
like a low quality mic as well

2245
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,440
right. One in his arse.

2246
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,440
Right, run away.

2247
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,440
Run away, so the AI doesn't lock onto me.

2248
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,440
Run away, run away.

2249
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:20,440
Surely the AI

2250
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:22,440
doesn't want any of this heat.

2251
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,440
The AI wants some of this heat.

2252
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:26,440
But once he realizes

2253
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:28,440
he can't come up the stairs,

2254
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,440
he will go away and I can shoot him in the arse.

2255
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,440
Okay?

2256
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,440
Okay, you can't find me.

2257
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:38,440
No. Keep looking.

2258
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,440
Yeah.

2259
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,440
Turn around.

2260
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,440
Every now and then.

2261
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,440
Yes!

2262
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,440
Okay, that was perfect.

2263
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,440
See, the actual,

2264
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,440
like, the actual

2265
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,440
level's fine.

2266
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,440
I'm not having to like, break a sweat over them.

2267
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,440
But the fucking

2268
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,440
bams

2269
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:02,440
that designed that boss fight,

2270
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,440
you know who you are

2271
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,440
and you should be embarrassed.

2272
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,440
Who flipped the label?

2273
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,440
I love when you roll your arse.

2274
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,440
Hit the mic at the end.

2275
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,440
No, I thought like the whole point of like the rage

2276
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,440
ASMR stuff is like, you batter the

2277
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,440
crap out of the mic as you're like,

2278
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,440
go to sleep.

2279
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,440
Go to sleep. No, I've had enough of you.

2280
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,440
I've been, I've been, I've been washing

2281
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,440
your clothes every day. Your clays.

2282
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,440
I've been washing your clays every day for you.

2283
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,440
You leave stuff everywhere behind you.

2284
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,440
I'm no your nanny. I'm no your mom.

2285
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,440
I'm your partner.

2286
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,440
I just start beating you up.

2287
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,440
Go to sleep because you didn't make any rubbish

2288
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,440
around the house when

2289
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,440
when you're asleep.

2290
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,440
Basically, that's how I imagine

2291
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,440
how I'd make that ASMR. It's like

2292
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,440
partner beats you unconscious.

2293
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,440
He's

2294
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,440
Scottish partner.

2295
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,440
A C plus.

2296
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,440
Oh, stop it, game. You're so nice to me.

2297
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,440
G willikers.

2298
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,440
You're so nice.

2299
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,440
I don't know.

2300
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,440
The way the boss is the easiest in the

2301
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,440
game, I think the next one will have fun.

2302
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,440
Don't say that.

2303
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,440
Just sounds like you made half of the ASMR

2304
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,440
concept on the spot. I do be kind of like that.

2305
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,440
Right. What's going on with the shop?

2306
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,440
What's our monies?

2307
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,440
I've got

2308
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,440
a thousand

2309
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,440
a larger sweeper pack.

2310
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,440
So that gives me more ammo.

2311
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:29,440
Um,

2312
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,440
at this point in time,

2313
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,440
I think

2314
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,440
I'm all good.

2315
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,440
I just straight up buy bombs.

2316
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,440
What kind of shop

2317
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,440
is this, madame?

2318
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,440
Okay, we now have

2319
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,440
six items.

2320
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,440
Instead of

2321
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,440
five.

2322
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,440
Anyway, we can put our ammo. I'm going to very

2323
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,440
fill up. I'm going to very fill up.

2324
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,440
I'm going to very quickly fill up

2325
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,440
my glass with more water.

2326
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,440
I kid you not, I'm like burst out in a

2327
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,440
sweat in that fight of that region.

2328
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,440
I'd literally just be a militant.

2329
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,440
Don't worry.

2330
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,440
Yeah, no one better thrown up

2331
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,440
by, I was gone for

2332
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:33,440
not even 10 seconds. I don't want any

2333
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,440
throw up.

2334
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,440
No, I was literally a militant.

2335
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,440
I didn't even need a mic.

2336
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,440
Thank you.

2337
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,440
You have a British accent.

2338
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,440
I've never been more insulted

2339
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,440
in my life. May all your ancestors

2340
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,440
be embarrassed on your behalf.

2341
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,440
Right, okay, let's see.

2342
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,440
What are we looking at? Right, so I

2343
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,440
can have six items, right? Surely.

2344
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,440
Yes, I can.

2345
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,440
Okay, I think that was a good

2346
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,440
investment.

2347
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,440
I was in eternity.

2348
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,440
I was gone for a millisecond.

2349
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,440
Wait, what's going on with that chart?

2350
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,440
Wait, if I'm not 10 items?

2351
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,440
No, I can't even have.

2352
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,440
You've packed them in a bit tightly game

2353
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,440
after I'd met. This is a bit tight.

2354
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,440
Like my

2355
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,440
yeah, he is very close.

2356
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,440
I don't know when the AI can lock on to me

2357
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,440
but I'm getting nervous, okay?

2358
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,440
He is staring. He knows I'm here.

2359
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,440
I'm getting nervous because he has magic

2360
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,440
that he can like Kablamo.

2361
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,440
Yeah, that is what I don't want. Oh, he's a one

2362
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,440
shot. Come on.

2363
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,440
There's a lot going on in this area

2364
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,440
after I've met. There's a lot going on.

2365
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,440
I can hear.

2366
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,440
I'm full health, so

2367
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,440
wait, can I have 10?

2368
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,440
I can have

2369
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,440
seven? Wait, that upgrade

2370
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,440
isn't. Oh, what does that mean?

2371
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,440
Sorry, I've never not

2372
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,440
killed one of them. Wait, I can have

2373
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,440
10 items or something now?

2374
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:09,440
No, Blinks, please

2375
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:11,440
stop. You're absolutely

2376
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,440
I don't know.

2377
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,440
I can hear noises. I'm getting scared.

2378
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,440
I can hear noises.

2379
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,440
I don't know where the enemy is.

2380
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,440
I don't know where the enemy is. I'm getting scared. Okay.

2381
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,440
Wait, so if I mess up, I need to like

2382
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,440
go all the way back here.

2383
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,440
Right, no. I go here. I go

2384
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,440
a little to the left. No, to be

2385
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,440
confused with the hit video game. A little

2386
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,440
to the left. Wait, I wasn't even supposed to go here.

2387
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,440
Where am I supposed to

2388
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,440
go? Hold on. Hold on. Let me

2389
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,440
kick. I don't know. I'm supposed to go there,

2390
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,440
but there's like a thing up there as well.

2391
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,440
I don't know.

2392
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,440
Hold on. Oh, and

2393
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,440
I missed. And I missed.

2394
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,440
Huh?

2395
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,440
Oh!

2396
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,440
Okay, I can't get it. I can't get it.

2397
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,440
I'll just let it happen.

2398
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,440
I'm not fighting. I'm not fighting.

2399
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,440
Oh my god, there's spikes back there.

2400
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,440
Okay, definitely do not go to ESK.

2401
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,440
Okay, hydration check. We fit a little

2402
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,440
to the left. We can't...

2403
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,440
I know I probably should have

2404
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,440
paused and grabbed it,

2405
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,440
but I'm not that fast

2406
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,440
right now.

2407
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,440
I honestly, all I'm going to see

2408
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,440
is it's going to be a...

2409
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,440
Oh, no.

2410
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,440
I don't know.

2411
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,440
I'm just a wee

2412
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,440
knuckle.

2413
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,440
You're joking, right?

2414
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,440
I...

2415
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,440
Wouldn't it be funny if I...

2416
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,440
Wouldn't it be funny

2417
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,440
if I was completely stuck in the...

2418
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,440
Okay, I'm fine.

2419
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,440
I don't know what you're worried about.

2420
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,440
Honestly, refland is fine.

2421
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,440
Right.

2422
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,440
I'm not even going to bother to pick up

2423
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,440
literally anything because...

2424
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,440
Okay, what was I supposed to do here?

2425
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,440
Please be honest.

2426
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,440
Right, okay. Let's get a POV.

2427
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,440
Okay.

2428
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,440
Follow the gold.

2429
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,440
And I missed again. Are you serious?

2430
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,440
Are you serious? Come on!

2431
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,440
I'm going to stick. I have to go down again.

2432
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,440
Okay. It's fine.

2433
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,440
It's fine. I'm not mad.

2434
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,440
I'm not mad.

2435
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,440
I'm not mad.

2436
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,440
Who said play this game?

2437
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,440
Honestly, let me... Oh, it's going to be like a cute

2438
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,440
little childhood game.

2439
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,440
Yeah, no wonder I couldn't get past the setting level.

2440
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,440
So I was for development team.

2441
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,440
I didn't care what you were smoking that day when you were like,

2442
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,440
you know what, let's... What?

2443
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,440
Am I going crazy? Am I going crazy?

2444
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,440
Am I going crazy?

2445
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,440
Am I going crazy?

2446
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,440
I'm not sure what the game

2447
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:51,440
wants from me,

2448
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,440
I'm kind of just trying

2449
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,440
to do some

2450
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,440
things

2451
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,440
over the rainbow.

2452
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,440
I'll be

2453
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,440
hopping away from...

2454
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,440
Wait, there's a platform there!

2455
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,440
I just spotted the platform!

2456
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,440
Come on, planks! Come on, planks!

2457
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,440
Come on, planks!

2458
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,360
Oh my god, I just spotted the platform. I genuinely didn't see that platform. I'm not I'm not even kidding

2459
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,160
I didn't see it. I've been jumping for ages trying to do something

2460
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,480
So I can have 10. I oh my god. Look at the ammo upgrade

2461
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:28,400
Oh my god, I didn't have to freaking try and do the world's biggest like bubble jump right you

2462
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:37,440
Okay, let's let's get to it. I'm not mad translates to I'm raging and strongy

2463
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:44,720
You know, it does make me region though, you know, it does make me region though when I'm wasting my ammo

2464
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:56,800
Okay, oh, oh, oh, no. Oh, no, don't do that

2465
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:03,280
Don't do that darling. Don't be so fucking stupid jump off the platform. Seriously

2466
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,280
Oh

2467
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:10,080
Okay, aimbot it's fine. I didn't want it anyway. It's fine. I didn't want aim assist anyway

2468
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:14,480
I didn't I honestly didn't want it. I don't know what makes you think that I want aim assist in a game like this

2469
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:16,560
That requires insane platforming like

2470
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,200
I don't I don't know

2471
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:20,480
please

2472
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,480
please

2473
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,480
Okay

2474
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:28,160
Dodged it like a pro actually

2475
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:32,080
Okay, there's only only a billion enemies ahead. It's fine

2476
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,920
I

2477
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,160
Know that one you okay

2478
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,440
And suck that up

2479
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,960
suck it

2480
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,960
Oh, no, and I forget invincibility

2481
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,200
okay

2482
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:49,200
And then you're next

2483
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:51,200
And then you're next and then you're next

2484
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:56,240
And then you're gonna get up and then you're next

2485
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:02,960
And then suck up these items. Oh my god. I'm doing it actually I should have got that upgrade a long time ago

2486
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,120
It's a lot easier to

2487
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:12,880
I don't want to actually I'm like I know it sounds silly, but I don't I'd rather have a reverse a pause and a double attack

2488
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,680
Than anything else. Oh my god

2489
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,200
I don't I don't know what you do. What do you do? I'm getting nervous. What do you do?

2490
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,320
Oh

2491
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,080
Are you serious?

2492
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,000
Yeah, damn right

2493
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:38,320
Damn freaking straight as if he like how is that supposed to know he was gonna trojan charge right in front of me like fuck off

2494
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,400
How is that supposed to even like

2495
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,520
Honestly

2496
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,520
I lost like all my items. I have like nothing to my name now. Wait, what was that?

2497
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,720
That's just a door. So then what was that button up there?

2498
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:05,360
I've got an echo me. I've got an echo. I'm just here for a good time. He takes all the money

2499
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,320
So he's stinky

2500
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:16,400
No, I do not want to replace my everything with fucking one random thing. Sorry. I'm purposely doing bad combos

2501
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:21,600
Uh, I'm guessing I could maybe get an upgrade that lets me hold more things

2502
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,320
If so, that would definitely be a good upgrade and then maybe we'll go back to health

2503
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:32,240
Two doors two buttons only one blink in need of the power of two

2504
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,360
Oh, is this where I'm finally having to use record

2505
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,960
Okay, bravo

2506
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,200
record

2507
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,200
jump

2508
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,840
Then what just remain on it or go to the other one. I don't I actually don't know

2509
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:58,240
I honestly don't know wait, what I don't know. I don't know. I've never used it before

2510
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,480
What is the moon? Oh

2511
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:08,480
Okay, okay. Okay. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Okay. Thank god. I was smart enough to stay on standing on that button

2512
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:13,760
Like actually, what does that mean? No blanks blanks. Wait blanks. What?

2513
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,800
Wait, what?

2514
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,760
Is that why it gave me so many green

2515
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,160
Did I just sophomore Danny go back?

2516
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,800
Oh, don't make me restart the mission

2517
01:46:35,120 --> 01:46:37,760
Don't make me go don't make me lose pro. No

2518
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:39,840
No

2519
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,960
Oh, wait. No, I have three green. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Right

2520
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:49,120
You jumped in and out of the button. No, just take the other gym. No hope. Okay, right

2521
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,920
So what the game wants me to do

2522
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,000
Okay

2523
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,240
Is it wants me to record me on the button, right? And I just stay on it, right?

2524
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,880
The entire time I stay on the button

2525
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,520
Yeah

2526
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,360
That's what I'm supposed to do and then I go to the other button and then I run

2527
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,640
Okay

2528
01:47:10,640 --> 01:47:12,240
Okay

2529
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:20,240
And then and then I do that I'm bouncing I'm bouncing I'm bouncing I'm bouncing I'm bouncing I'm bouncing I'm bouncing I'm bouncing

2530
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,240
I'm bouncing, I'm bouncing, I'm bouncing

2531
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,040
And then

2532
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,880
Okay, okay

2533
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,880
Okay

2534
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,880
And then fucking son of

2535
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,800
Fuck it. Wait, can I pause time? Maybe it's better to pause time. I have no idea

2536
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:49,800
Oh, no, you can't pause time when there's time. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you need to fucking do. What? I don't understand.

2537
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:55,800
No, what? I don't. What do you want me to do?

2538
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,800
I can only have one in effect at a time.

2539
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:04,800
Oh, for fuck's sake, this game's too confusing.

2540
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:09,800
No, what does it mean?

2541
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,800
Okay, right.

2542
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:16,800
Right, fucking send it!

2543
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:20,800
Fuck off!

2544
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,800
Do you know how long it took me to get here?

2545
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,800
Perish, no.

2546
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:27,800
Don't annoy me.

2547
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,800
Don't upset me, and you fuck off as well, you ebam, and he's gonna respawn.

2548
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:36,800
He's gonna respawn, right in front of me.

2549
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:38,800
I already know it.

2550
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:42,800
I swear if the game bugs out, because he decided to go on a journey off.

2551
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,800
There's a fucking...

2552
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:57,800
You can't be like, your time's up, but then the monster's not even here.

2553
01:48:58,800 --> 01:48:59,800
I'll piss.

2554
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,800
I'm fucking trying!

2555
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:03,800
Jump, oh my god.

2556
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,800
No, just to add insult to injury.

2557
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,800
You have to fucking speedrun the bloody missions as well.

2558
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,800
This game didn't age well, okay, I said it.

2559
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:20,800
This game, I didn't even know there was a freaking time limit, and of course the frog despawns just to really upset me.

2560
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:24,800
Like, you don't upset me, I'm actually, I'm raging, I'm raging.

2561
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:26,800
Who picked this game? It was me.

2562
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,800
Why did you pick the game? I don't know, okay.

2563
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:42,800
I just assumed it was one of those games where I couldn't play it as a child, because I was a child, but I can't even play it as an adult, so...

2564
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:47,800
Right, let's see what the damage is to the sanity.

2565
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,800
Right.

2566
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:02,800
Okay, already dying. Okay, nay. Yep, mm-hmm.

2567
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:08,800
Didn't really even get started! Didn't even get started!

2568
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:13,800
Oh, that's me. Oh, okay, right, okay.

2569
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:19,800
Don't you love it? I'm even fucking getting started, and I'm already did it.

2570
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,800
I've not even been able to comprehend. Oh, okay.

2571
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,800
Oh, that was such a good attempt. Lovely, lovely game.

2572
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,800
Very well rendered and polished bosses.

2573
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:40,800
Okay.

2574
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:43,800
So, okay.

2575
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:44,800
Okay.

2576
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:49,800
Mm-hmm.

2577
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:57,800
Right, okay, but see, here's the thing. I need to pick up ammo before you attack me.

2578
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,800
Because how am I supposed to shoot you if I don't have any fucking ammo in my body holder?

2579
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:05,800
Right.

2580
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,800
Right.

2581
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:11,800
Yeah.

2582
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:12,800
Okay.

2583
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:15,800
Mm-hmm.

2584
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,800
Right.

2585
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,800
Right, mm-hmm.

2586
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:29,800
Yep, okay.

2587
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:33,800
Uh-huh.

2588
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:37,800
Right, if you keep your cool, the game's actually easy-peasy, lame and squeezy.

2589
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,800
I can't believe it. I can't believe you let your emotions get the better of you.

2590
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:43,800
Wah!

2591
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:46,800
Okay.

2592
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,800
Let's get over that.

2593
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:51,800
Uh-huh.

2594
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,800
I don't know where it is. I only have one health. Oh, I missed it.

2595
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:57,800
That's okay.

2596
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,800
Oh, that's not okay though. Don't do that again.

2597
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,800
It takes away the platforms?

2598
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,800
Monkho!

2599
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,800
Um, I'm gonna be honest.

2600
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,800
I need you to stop taking away the platforms that are for my safety.

2601
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:19,800
Oh, look at that!

2602
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,800
Uh, how am I supposed to shoot him if I have like one place to stand to shoot him on?

2603
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,800
I don't, I don't know what you want from me, buddy.

2604
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,800
I don't know what you want from me.

2605
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:35,800
I don't, is one HP in a dream right now?

2606
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:42,800
I'm one HP in a, well, I'm technically two HP in a dream, but I don't,

2607
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,800
I can't shoot you from here.

2608
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:47,800
Oh my God, right. Okay.

2609
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:50,800
That one was actually fair, unlike the frog.

2610
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,800
Unlike the frog, this one was actually fair.

2611
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,800
Can I please at least keep some of the gems so I can upgrade my equipment?

2612
01:52:58,800 --> 01:52:59,800
I'm great.

2613
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:02,800
I would like to keep some of the gems to upgrade my equipment.

2614
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,800
Okay, now for the next challenge.

2615
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,800
Actually get out the level.

2616
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,800
Okay, that one, mildly fair.

2617
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,800
Mildly fair.

2618
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:17,800
That was a C rank for doing it in under three minutes.

2619
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,800
Get real.

2620
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,800
Like, actually get real.

2621
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,800
This game is not for children.

2622
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,800
I don't know why.

2623
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,800
Japan, I don't know what's your obsession with making like the most frustrating games ever.

2624
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:34,800
Like, aren't you frustrated enough with like the work fucking culture over there?

2625
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:39,800
Like, why is it all bombs?

2626
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:41,800
What?

2627
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:44,800
Why is it all bombs?

2628
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:47,800
It's going to set off a chain fucking reaction.

2629
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:50,800
It's going to set off a chain fucking reaction.

2630
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,800
What is going on over there?

2631
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,800
I don't even have anything to shove at them, other than bombs.

2632
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:05,800
What are we nuking?

2633
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:08,800
It's the forgotten city.

2634
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,800
That looks like something I can bomb.

2635
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,800
Or is it just map design?

2636
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,800
It's just map design.

2637
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:17,800
I'm so excited though.

2638
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:21,800
I can't even get out there.

2639
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:24,800
I can't, hold on, don't lock on to me.

2640
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,800
I'm not ready yet.

2641
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,800
No, I said don't lock on to me, I'm not ready.

2642
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,800
Stop.

2643
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:34,800
Don't, you're making me nervous.

2644
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,800
I need hearts, okay?

2645
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,800
Okay, thank you, I need hearts.

2646
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:44,800
Give me one.

2647
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,800
Give me two.

2648
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,800
Give me three.

2649
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,800
Give me four.

2650
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,800
Oh yeah, do I have another purple?

2651
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:56,800
I do, right, we can technically have a rewind.

2652
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:00,800
Why are you locked off the previous part of the map to me?

2653
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,800
I was the one who got us here.

2654
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,800
Right, we'll do a rewind.

2655
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:10,800
Suck the ball and get a hundred easy smackery.

2656
01:55:11,800 --> 01:55:13,800
I probably should actually.

2657
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:17,800
Everything's a freaking death trap.

2658
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,800
In this map, honestly.

2659
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,800
I just want items.

2660
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,800
And it's like bombs.

2661
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,800
I think I'm gonna run out of time at the rate I'm going at.

2662
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,800
I'm not gonna lie, this is getting rough.

2663
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,800
What's this?

2664
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,800
There needs to be two of you to go higher on a sea soul.

2665
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,800
Whoa.

2666
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:44,800
You guys are bouncing away over there.

2667
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,800
I don't know what you want from me.

2668
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,800
I need the green over here.

2669
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:55,800
I just want, I want two green.

2670
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,800
I'm gonna so run out of time this map, I'm sorry.

2671
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,800
There's no way in hell.

2672
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:12,800
So Bravo record.

2673
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:22,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2674
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,800
Okay.

2675
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,800
I don't know if I need to...

2676
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,800
Is that actually gonna kablamo me?

2677
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,800
Hello?

2678
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,800
I spent half an hour jumping on that.

2679
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,800
And the game's like, yeah, nice try.

2680
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,800
What?

2681
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,800
Two, three.

2682
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:57,800
The other way? It can't be.

2683
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:59,800
Oh wait.

2684
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,800
No, it can't be. Are you trolling me?

2685
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,800
It can't be.

2686
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,800
I'm supposed to go up the green path.

2687
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,800
You've just trolled me and I need to restart the mission there.

2688
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:11,800
Oh, right.

2689
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,800
What am I supposed to do?

2690
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:21,800
Oh no, it's gonna repeat.

2691
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,800
Where do I go?

2692
01:57:29,800 --> 01:57:31,800
Can I go on an edge here?

2693
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,800
Oh wait, there's an edge.

2694
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,800
No!

2695
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:39,800
Wait, is there anywhere I can go?

2696
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,800
I don't think there's anywhere I can hide.

2697
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:47,800
Run! Mummy's trying! Mummy's trying!

2698
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,800
I'm trying to get out of the blast zone.

2699
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,800
Oh my god, I did somehow.

2700
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:53,800
Jeez.

2701
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,800
I kind of purposely want him to start throwing shit at me.

2702
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:02,800
Yeah, I'm gonna need some more stuff other than bombs to get anywhere.

2703
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:05,800
I'm not even kidding because this is getting bad.

2704
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,800
We have eight monsters to go.

2705
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:11,800
I mean, we're hardly anywhere.

2706
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,800
Oh my god, it's just all bombs.

2707
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:20,800
This entire map is just bomb city.

2708
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:33,800
I do appreciate the kind of...

2709
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,800
I know you're getting...

2710
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:42,800
But this is so dangerous.

2711
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:52,800
I'm gonna pick up the pause and then I'm gonna pick up the heart.

2712
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:55,800
I think we might be replaying this one.

2713
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,800
I'm not even kidding.

2714
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:01,800
This is just all bombs.

2715
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,800
Only bomb.

2716
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,800
There's something blue over there.

2717
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,800
I just saw it.

2718
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:12,800
It's something neon blue over there.

2719
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,800
Okay, thank goodness we have a rewind.

2720
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,800
I'm gonna be honest.

2721
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:25,800
This game concept is starting to...

2722
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,800
Hmm, oh well. No, it's fine.

2723
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:32,800
You can just randomly throw the bomb not in the direction of anything.

2724
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,800
It's fine. I didn't want to win anywhere.

2725
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,800
That frog didn't die?

2726
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:43,800
Do you eat bombs?

2727
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:54,800
Bro, this guy can...

2728
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,800
Oh yeah, I was gonna say, what's going on here?

2729
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:59,800
You made me nervous.

2730
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,800
You made me nervous.

2731
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,800
I'm gonna be honest.

2732
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,800
I'm gonna be...

2733
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:12,800
This is the first game in almost two months that I've picked purely on.

2734
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,800
I admit it.

2735
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,800
Hello? Where are you?

2736
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,800
Suck'em?

2737
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:35,800
Huh?

2738
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,800
Well, that was bloody creative.

2739
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,800
I'll give you that, Dave team.

2740
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,800
What was that?

2741
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:54,800
There's sort of bombs in there.

2742
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:00,800
Oh, well, I missed that one up.

2743
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:04,800
I literally have four minutes left.

2744
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,800
Are you serious?

2745
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:12,800
Is the door evil? Why is the door evil?

2746
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,800
Can I come in?

2747
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,800
Oh, falling down.

2748
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:25,800
Oh, balls up. I'm in the swamp now.

2749
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,800
Ooh, maybe.

2750
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:35,800
Do I all lock on you or what?

2751
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:38,800
What do you do?

2752
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:41,800
I don't...

2753
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:44,800
Do I raid you like a fucking carpet?

2754
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,800
Do I suck you up?

2755
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:49,800
Let me in!

2756
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:53,800
Huh?

2757
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:55,800
That is...

2758
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,800
Okay.

2759
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,800
Suck'em up.

2760
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,800
I don't know. Maybe suck'em?

2761
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,800
Did he just suck...

2762
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:08,800
What?

2763
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,800
Oh, okay, well...

2764
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,800
Pause his tea.

2765
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:20,800
All doors are evil. Boldest things.

2766
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,800
What?

2767
02:02:23,800 --> 02:02:26,800
He's trying to hurt me.

2768
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,800
Someone says pause.

2769
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,800
Is any like a bear vacuum?

2770
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,800
I don't know.

2771
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:41,800
There's literally nothing I can do right now.

2772
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:45,800
Oh, other than bomb myself, apparently.

2773
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:46,800
I don't...

2774
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,800
I don't know what you want from me, buddy.

2775
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,800
I'm afraid we've lost this one.

2776
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:59,800
I'm due to team.

2777
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:06,800
That I don't understand.

2778
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,800
Can you jump on him while pause?

2779
02:03:11,800 --> 02:03:13,800
Ooh, like jump over the gate?

2780
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:15,800
That might be it.

2781
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,800
Jump around the door park or so.

2782
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,800
I want to say yes, but I...

2783
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,800
Oh!

2784
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,800
Well, I've done it now.

2785
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,800
Oh!

2786
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,800
I was joking!

2787
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:36,800
I think we were joking!

2788
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:39,800
I legitimately thought...

2789
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:41,800
I think we were joking.

2790
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:44,800
Oh, my God, please.

2791
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:46,800
I don't have time for this.

2792
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,800
I don't have time for like four back-to-back enemies

2793
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:51,800
in a really close environment with bombs everywhere.

2794
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,800
Oh, this is gravy.

2795
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:56,800
Who should I go for him?

2796
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,800
I need my...

2797
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,800
Ray, okay.

2798
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,800
Okay.

2799
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:09,800
What is going on with the shop?

2800
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:16,800
We're not making it out of this one, see?

2801
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:17,800
I don't even have enough.

2802
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:19,800
I have enough for another heart container.

2803
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,800
That's the best I can do right now.

2804
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,800
But we...

2805
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:26,800
I'm warning everyone who's like,

2806
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:28,800
oh, she's gonna finish the game this straight.

2807
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,800
I am not.

2808
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:31,800
I'm not.

2809
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:33,800
I'm saying it now.

2810
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:35,800
I think when Sheebie goes live,

2811
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:37,800
we'll redirect into her,

2812
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:40,800
because it's just no happening.

2813
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,800
Pompey, more like shite pay,

2814
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:43,800
because this is awful.

2815
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,800
Lost city, more like shite city.

2816
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:47,800
Thank you, I'll be here all week.

2817
02:04:47,800 --> 02:04:48,800
You're not.

2818
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:50,800
There's no way.

2819
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,800
I'm getting stuck in the child's game.

2820
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:56,800
There's no way in heck that I'm doing anything remotely right.

2821
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:00,800
Like...

2822
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,800
You know what I mean?

2823
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,800
I'm gonna finish the game twice.

2824
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,800
I don't know if she'll be streamed.

2825
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:11,800
She's having problems with the cat.

2826
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,800
Oh, okay, okay.

2827
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:17,800
Like, it's no happening.

2828
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,800
Okay, we need to rewind.

2829
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:21,800
That's fine.

2830
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:23,800
If I can jump over this,

2831
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:25,800
right, is there a heart?

2832
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:26,800
There is.

2833
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,800
We're gonna fill our heart container up.

2834
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:35,800
You've got two.

2835
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:36,800
We try.

2836
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:38,800
Try using other projectiles

2837
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:39,800
and just the bombs.

2838
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:41,800
The bombs can't hit enemies properly.

2839
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:43,800
Wow, it is not...

2840
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,800
How do you say in French?

2841
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:47,800
It is not possible.

2842
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,800
No, it is not...

2843
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:50,800
No, no, no.

2844
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:51,800
It is...

2845
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,800
I like how he's on the platform.

2846
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:56,800
Okay.

2847
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:57,800
Great.

2848
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,800
Then we need the green.

2849
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:01,800
Get green.

2850
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:03,800
Get greened on.

2851
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:05,800
Okay.

2852
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:07,800
I guess we'll put the green.

2853
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,800
Okay.

2854
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:12,800
I guess we'll take the two of these.

2855
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,800
We've lost our pause,

2856
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,800
but I don't think we needed one.

2857
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:18,800
Okay.

2858
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:19,800
Then Bravo.

2859
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,800
Then A and a.

2860
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:22,800
Jump.

2861
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:23,800
Jump.

2862
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:24,800
Jump.

2863
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:26,800
I'm aware.

2864
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:27,800
Jump.

2865
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:28,800
Jump.

2866
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:29,800
Jump.

2867
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:30,800
Jump.

2868
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:31,800
Jump.

2869
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:34,800
Okay.

2870
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:36,800
Okay.

2871
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,800
That was like a billion jumps.

2872
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:41,800
Okay.

2873
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:43,800
Okay.

2874
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:44,800
Right.

2875
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,800
How did I survive this last time?

2876
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:49,800
I think I got like frame lucky or something.

2877
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:50,800
I don't know.

2878
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:53,800
Feels a bit tight.

2879
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:56,800
Not right next to me, you twat bag.

2880
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,800
Jump the wall.

2881
02:06:58,800 --> 02:06:59,800
Cling the wall.

2882
02:06:59,800 --> 02:07:00,800
I think we're safe.

2883
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:01,800
Okay.

2884
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:03,800
I don't know how we did it,

2885
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:04,800
but I think we're all right.

2886
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:05,800
Okay.

2887
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,800
I would like him to shoot Furniture,

2888
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:13,800
but he's really refusing a lawful enemy.

2889
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,800
Oh, he does it just as I perish him.

2890
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:16,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2891
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:19,800
That works too.

2892
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:20,800
Pro strat is literally.

2893
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:21,800
Ugh.

2894
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:22,800
Okay.

2895
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:23,800
We've got the door.

2896
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,800
Is there any health we can mash together

2897
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:26,800
or not?

2898
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,800
We're really just going to look up.

2899
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:29,800
Okay.

2900
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,800
We're just going to send it.

2901
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,800
We're going to need to scoop up some bounce.

2902
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:41,800
Oh, and I'm just trying to.

2903
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:42,800
Oh, wow.

2904
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,800
That for someone who couldn't see the enemy,

2905
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:48,800
that went a lot better than what could have happened.

2906
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:49,800
Right.

2907
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:51,800
So the bridge is going to get destroyed up ahead.

2908
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:52,800
That's fine.

2909
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:53,800
We're expecting it.

2910
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,800
I'm going to grab a pause.

2911
02:07:56,800 --> 02:07:57,800
Uh.

2912
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:02,800
Okay.

2913
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:11,800
Okay.

2914
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:12,800
Okay.

2915
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,800
We're doing much better this time around.

2916
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,800
Let's not give up just yet.

2917
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:17,800
I've already gave up inside,

2918
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:19,800
but let's not give up just yet.

2919
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,800
Okay.

2920
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:23,800
A 316 no scope literally around the corner.

2921
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,800
Can you see the damn thing?

2922
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:28,800
Um, is Emmy coming online?

2923
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:34,800
Okay.

2924
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:35,800
Hold on, Mr. Frog.

2925
02:08:35,800 --> 02:08:36,800
Not now.

2926
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:37,800
Oh.

2927
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:38,800
Nope.

2928
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:39,800
That wasn't it.

2929
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,800
Don't be afraid to turn around

2930
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:44,800
and look at the enemy blinks.

2931
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:46,800
It's Mercy instead.

2932
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:49,800
Oh, don't make me play this game for six hours, guys.

2933
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:51,800
Please.

2934
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,800
Anyone pop up stream right now?

2935
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,800
Oh, no.

2936
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:57,800
The fucking enemy frog

2937
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:00,800
that's getting closer with each hop.

2938
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,800
The aim assist is gone.

2939
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,800
It is non-existent.

2940
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:06,800
Okay.

2941
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:07,800
Let's go.

2942
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,800
Got paused by accident.

2943
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,800
Look at his face.

2944
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:19,800
So happy.

2945
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,800
Okay.

2946
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:24,800
Okay.

2947
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:27,800
Does it...

2948
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:30,800
Did it have to be paused to get around?

2949
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:31,800
Whoa.

2950
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:33,800
Wow.

2951
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:34,800
Okay.

2952
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:35,800
It unironically had to be paused.

2953
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:36,800
Do you want to know why?

2954
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:39,800
Because it is all locking on that ghost fuck...

2955
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:41,800
Wait, I wasn't...

2956
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:42,800
Wait.

2957
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:43,800
Did I do a frame perfect thing

2958
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:46,800
that I've never been going to be ever able to do again?

2959
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,800
You have ASMR clubs to work on?

2960
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,800
I would much rather go offline

2961
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:52,800
and then I will upload...

2962
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:53,800
Stop!

2963
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:54,800
Right.

2964
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:55,800
So you didn't auto lock

2965
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,800
to literally any other enemy,

2966
02:09:57,800 --> 02:09:59,800
but when it comes to that ghost,

2967
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:00,800
all of a sudden...

2968
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,800
Ooh, we love auto locking.

2969
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:03,800
Ooh.

2970
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:04,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2971
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:05,800
Up my arms.

2972
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:07,800
I'd rather go offline

2973
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:08,800
and then in exchange,

2974
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,800
I will literally subtitle the shit

2975
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:12,800
out of that fucking...

2976
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:13,800
Um...

2977
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:16,800
Prego ASMR for you.

2978
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:18,800
And then I'll upload that instead

2979
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:19,800
because...

2980
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:20,800
Fucking hell!

2981
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,800
Why do you take a pound in?

2982
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:24,800
What are you, ectoplasm?

2983
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:27,800
Oh, no.

2984
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:29,800
My bombs, I need them.

2985
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:30,800
But...

2986
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:31,800
I've just done that now.

2987
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:35,800
Fucking how much HP you got, bruv?

2988
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,800
It's a bit outrageous, honestly.

2989
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,800
Okay, he's like taking more damage.

2990
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:43,800
And of course that hurt me.

2991
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:44,800
Ooh.

2992
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:46,800
That sounds like a good idea.

2993
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,800
Yeah, I'd rather upload pregnancy ASMR

2994
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,800
than finish this game.

2995
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:55,800
But you have to give me credit.

2996
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:56,800
For streaming for two months

2997
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,800
in only one game,

2998
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,800
I'm like, I'm fucking miserable playing.

2999
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,800
You have to give me credit.

3000
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:03,800
I've picked Will.

3001
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:05,800
I've picked Will.

3002
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:06,800
Sorry, I said it.

3003
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:07,800
I'm sorry.

3004
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:09,800
I'm giving myself a pat on the back.

3005
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:11,800
I literally...

3006
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:16,800
What are you?

3007
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:23,800
Okay, please don't give me the ghost back though.

3008
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,800
Okay, let's try this again.

3009
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,800
Without this guy being a squat baggin...

3010
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,800
Okay, well...

3011
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:34,800
Oh, I'm getting...

3012
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,800
Right, anyway, pregnancy ASMR, anyone?

3013
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:39,800
Anyone want to be in my tummy?

3014
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,800
Who would like to be in my stomach?

3015
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:43,800
Because I know what it's one of yours.

3016
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:45,800
I know what it's one of yours that want to be in my tummy.

3017
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,800
Okay, now give me credit where credit is due.

3018
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,800
I've streamed every single day.

3019
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:54,800
I've done so much variety of games.

3020
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,800
Please allow me to shove one game in the bin, okay?

3021
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:01,800
Please, I ask you kindly,

3022
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:04,800
allow me to put this game in the bin.

3023
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:08,800
In exchange for putting this game in the bin,

3024
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:11,800
I will upload pregnancy ASMR.

3025
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:12,800
You have my word.

3026
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:14,800
I have the energy to continue, okay?

3027
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:17,800
I have the energy to keep editing.

3028
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:22,800
I will upload that pregnancy ASMR as fast as I possibly can, okay?

3029
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:24,800
You must continue.

3030
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:25,800
Absolutely not.

3031
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,800
I'm sure it's probably fun.

3032
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,800
It might be a bit funny ha ha to watch me rage or whatever.

3033
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:35,800
I am miserable and dead on the inside right now.

3034
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:40,800
I may not sound it because I'm happy to upload the...

3035
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:44,800
I'm happy to upload what?

3036
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:49,800
I'm happy to upload the pregnancy ASMR, okay?

3037
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:53,800
Does this mean this is the shortest stream I will ever do

3038
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:55,800
for the rest of my streaming days?

3039
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:57,800
That is how short the stream is, okay?

3040
02:12:57,800 --> 02:12:59,800
No need to...

3041
02:12:59,800 --> 02:13:01,800
Yeah, I'd rather not push it.

3042
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:02,800
That's all good.

3043
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:03,800
It's okay, mommy.

3044
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:04,800
I really don't care about the game.

3045
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:05,800
It's because I enjoy watching games.

3046
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:07,800
Oh, that's adorable.

3047
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:16,800
I will redirect into the only streamer live right now is Nene.

3048
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:17,800
And she's doing the DLC.

3049
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:21,800
So if you don't want any Elden Ring spoilers,

3050
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:25,800
you are welcome to not watch that

3051
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:28,800
because she is doing Elden Ring thingy.

3052
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:30,800
And that is the only person I'm subscribed to

3053
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:32,800
that's actually streaming right now.

3054
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,800
So here we go.

3055
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,800
Aw, she's doing that little 3D TV model.

3056
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:38,800
Okay, I do apologize.

3057
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,800
I did plan to stream longer,

3058
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,800
but in exchange for me pissing off all,

3059
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:46,800
I will upload the pregnancy ASMR, okay?

3060
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,800
So get ready to be in my stomach

3061
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:50,800
in probably T minus one hour.

3062
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:51,800
I'm gonna make a cup of tea.

3063
02:13:51,800 --> 02:13:53,800
I'm gonna fucking subtitle out the wazoo.

3064
02:13:53,800 --> 02:13:55,800
And it will be up in an hour.

3065
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:56,800
Okay, give me one hour.

3066
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:58,800
And don't forget to hit that like and subscribe bell.

3067
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,800
Come on, two months.

3068
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,800
Two months and I've dropped one game.

3069
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:04,800
Come on, you have to give it to, come on.

3070
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,800
You have to give credit where credit's due.

3071
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,800
Come on, streamed every single day.

3072
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,800
And only dropped one game.

3073
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,800
Come on, give it to me.

3074
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:14,800
Come on.

3075
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,800
I'll definitely research.

3076
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:19,800
I normally always research the game I'm about to play.

3077
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:21,800
This was the only exception

3078
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:24,800
because I did endurance yesterday for 12 hours.

3079
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:26,800
This is literally the exception, okay?

3080
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,800
Thank you so, so much, my little reeflings.

3081
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:30,800
I do apologize, but with the same gesture,

3082
02:14:30,800 --> 02:14:33,800
I do offer you straight up pregnancy tomorrow

3083
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:36,800
as a sorry, which I think hopefully

3084
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,800
repays the debt.

3085
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:42,800
Tomorrow, I believe, is...

3086
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:44,800
What is tomorrow?

3087
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:47,800
Whatever tomorrow is, it's better than today.

3088
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:49,800
I'm so sorry.

3089
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:50,800
I'm so sorry.

3090
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:52,800
Tomorrow...

3091
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:55,800
Oh, I've not even uploaded my schedule.

3092
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:57,800
Do you guys know what I'm doing tomorrow?

3093
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,800
What is my schedule?

3094
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,800
What is my schedule?

3095
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:07,800
Hold on, let me pull it up.

3096
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,800
Oh, here we go.

3097
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,800
Okay, let's just pretend today didn't happen.

3098
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,800
It's ASMR and then a membership watch along.

3099
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:17,800
Okay, nice and easy.

3100
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:19,800
Cheeky ASMR, can I ask?

3101
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:20,800
I'll actually do it.

3102
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:22,800
And then I have back-to-back Lego Lord of the Rings,

3103
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,800
which is my favorite game of all time.

3104
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,800
So we're doing ASMR tomorrow,

3105
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:33,800
and then we're doing watch along and membership.

3106
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:35,800
If that's not your cup of tea, please don't worry.

3107
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:36,800
I stream every day.

3108
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,800
You'll always have free access to the stream every single day.

3109
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:40,800
And then we're doing back-to-back Lego Lord of the Rings.

3110
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,800
100% completion is my favorite game,

3111
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:45,800
is one of the top 10 games of me personally.

3112
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,800
I love it, I adore it.

3113
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:49,800
Peggle doesn't need an introduction,

3114
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:51,800
but pegging possibly.

3115
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:53,800
I don't worry, I'll e-shoot into it.

3116
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:56,800
That was disgusting behavior, but I love it.

3117
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:58,800
And then a membership hand-cam ASMR.

3118
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:01,800
I'm testing out a prop.

3119
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:03,800
No, not a figurine.

3120
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:04,800
Stop.

3121
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,800
It's a prop for ASMR before anyone is like,

3122
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:07,800
a prop?

3123
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:08,800
No, relax.

3124
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:10,800
I'm not trying to bait you into becoming a member.

3125
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:11,800
Okay, relax.

3126
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:13,800
I'm using a thing,

3127
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:16,800
and I'm testing it with you guys

3128
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,800
before we do a mainstream with it, okay?

3129
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:20,800
No, it's not a figurine, okay?

3130
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:22,800
It's not a figurine.

3131
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,800
Then I'm doing a mystery,

3132
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,800
Dead by Daylight collab.

3133
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:29,800
And I think I know who the team's made up of,

3134
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:34,800
so I might actually brush off on my Dead by Daylight very shortly.

3135
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,800
I did the tutorial, but we like working.

3136
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:41,800
Then we're gonna do public.

3137
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:43,800
Public, that sounds rude.

3138
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:46,800
It is gonna be Fortnite

3139
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:48,800
as our StreamSnipe game.

3140
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:49,800
I don't know how it's gonna go.

3141
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:50,800
I've not played it in a very long time,

3142
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:53,800
so again, I'm gonna have to do my research soon enough.

3143
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:56,800
And then membership, we're going to try chess.com.

3144
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,800
I need to make an account and all of that,

3145
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:02,800
and then we're gonna see if we can stream snipe each other in chess.com.

3146
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:05,800
And then Halo Combat Evolved,

3147
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:07,800
which needs no introduction,

3148
02:17:07,800 --> 02:17:10,800
but please remember

3149
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:14,800
that Legolord of the Ring starts two hours later

3150
02:17:14,800 --> 02:17:16,800
than my usual start time,

3151
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:18,800
because I'm having the Veiler meeting.

3152
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:19,800
That's when we're doing it.

3153
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:21,800
Oh my god, oh my god, inside news.

3154
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:24,800
That's when the meeting is conducted.

3155
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:27,800
Because everyone's awake at that time.

3156
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:30,800
And it's not too late for Icicle, poor Icicle.

3157
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,800
If Gen 2, if we get Gen 2,

3158
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:35,800
and there's more European members,

3159
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,800
we're getting fucking fubbernocked.

3160
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:41,800
But anyway,

3161
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:44,800
Dead by Daylight is one hour before my usual start time.

3162
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:46,800
Please be aware, okay?

3163
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:49,800
But everything else in this week, perfect.

3164
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:51,800
Nothing is gonna make me be reached.

3165
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:55,800
This game, I'm sorry, I ain't cut out for this kind of game.

3166
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:57,800
I'm sorry, I ain't built like that.

3167
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:59,800
But yes, this is the plan, this is schedule.

3168
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:03,800
And T-minus one hour, when I click go offline,

3169
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:08,800
T-minus one hour, we will play.

3170
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:12,800
We will, you will be in my stomach.

3171
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,800
I will be pregnant with you.

3172
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,800
We will have an umbilical cord together, okay?

3173
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:17,800
Deal, deal.

3174
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:18,800
Okay, I love you.

3175
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,800
I love you, Reeflings.

3176
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:20,800
Thank you for your patience.

3177
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,800
Wait, you're also playing Fortnite?

3178
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:24,800
That's the StreamSnipe game.

3179
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:26,800
For a public StreamSnipe game,

3180
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:27,800
we're gonna try and play Fortnite,

3181
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:28,800
but I don't know if it's gonna work.

3182
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:32,800
I ain't played Fortnite since that thing came out.

3183
02:18:32,800 --> 02:18:33,800
So I have no idea what to expect,

3184
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:35,800
but I'm gonna do some offline play,

3185
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:36,800
just so I know what I'm doing.

3186
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:39,800
I'm not making a mockery of myself, right?

3187
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:41,800
Okay, I love you, little Reeflings.

3188
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:43,800
Okay, I do apologize, but at the same time,

3189
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:45,800
pregnancy is smart, so you can't get mad, okay?

3190
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:47,800
Now give me a kiss.

3191
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:51,800
And as always, when I redirect into someone else,

3192
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:54,800
please do be respectful of them,

3193
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:57,800
because I am not them, they are not me.

3194
02:18:57,800 --> 02:18:58,800
Love you, Reeflings.

3195
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:01,800
Thank you for your unwavering patience for me.

3196
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:04,800
T-minus one hour for the prego ego ASMR, okay?

3197
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:05,800
Mwah!

3198
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:07,800
See you tomorrow, Goofy Goofy!

3199
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:09,800
Mwah!
