WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
my little reflex I added a denoiser filter but I don't know if that made the stream worse

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
hi reflex

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
good morning

00:29.000 --> 00:43.000
mommy's right here she just had to wake up late because I was being a mommy and I was having to do a lot of work

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm strongly left by some I mean it

00:49.000 --> 00:55.000
hello hello my little reflex

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
hi shh shh shh shh shh shh it's okay

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
mommy's here

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
shh shh shh hello little baby

01:09.000 --> 01:27.000
I've put a little um a noise gate on the microphone so hopefully the background noise isn't like the weight noise isn't too bad

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
I um they don't cope well without you know I don't cope well without my reflinks

01:35.000 --> 01:50.000
I had to do some business last night and there may or may not be a collab with another agency planned

01:50.000 --> 02:02.000
um do I spoil it do you want me to spoil the surprise cause only you only know what the surprise is if you're in this chat right now

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
also please do check emotes for those of you who are on the emotes here

02:08.000 --> 02:18.000
I was able to add all 10 of my emotes and I get to order 10 more and I'm so excited to order the next batch of 10 emotes

02:18.000 --> 02:38.000
um I already have a few ideas but yes please I will try to be as relaxed as I can but the problem is I get so excited talking to you

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
that basically the ASMR goes out the window hold on what is this there we go

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
yeah there's your warning uh we are not doing hypnosis uh unfortunately

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
thank you very much night sterling for becoming a free fling member dear

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000

03:04.000 --> 03:15.000
long do Imo win you leave my long toes out of this disclaimer saying go

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
but I'm going to try and be relaxing thank you jay for becoming a member

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
thank you again Gwispy for becoming a member

03:27.000 --> 03:35.000
I know I've got my hypnosis background I was originally going

03:35.000 --> 03:43.000
huh Brian can you guys hear Brian

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
pachinka thank you for the five gifted hold on let me get a stream of elements

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
anonymous thank you for the tip

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
wait anonymous is high strongy hopefully your day is amazing it's just going to start it

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
and since I get to start with my reef links it's going great

04:06.000 --> 04:16.000
Brian is very quiet yes I didn't I knew ASMR so I turned Brian down like right away

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
I can maybe film up a little bit but I have a quick question how did you learn hypnosis

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
I just observe I want to get into but it's kind of intimidating

04:27.000 --> 04:36.000
literally I just observe I absolutely love going like deep into things I don't know about

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
and I've always had an interest in it so I like to consume people's production or whatever

04:45.000 --> 04:54.000
sorry and thank you for the 100 but congrats on monetization years for some of that most bro

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
sorry and that's a lot thank you oh my god

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
100 dollar tip that's crazy 100 centimeters nah that's not possible

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
but pachinka thank you for the five gifted

05:11.000 --> 05:22.000
but yeah I just really like challenging myself I always have a fascination in trying to understand

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
why people like certain things I know that seems silly

05:27.000 --> 05:38.000
but I do I just enjoy it like as much as I might tease the prep bros or something like that

05:38.000 --> 05:46.000
I just find it fascinating I honestly do like what makes you you know what make what tickles your pickle

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
it's like it's a challenge to me and I accept it wholeheartedly

05:54.000 --> 06:04.000
but yeah secret subject is an excellent feature but secret subject is such a sweet heart

06:04.000 --> 06:14.000
she so willingly educates the masses about it and like I love that she doesn't like cakey bit or anything

06:14.000 --> 06:24.000
but like everything that I do right now or produce is because of observations I've made

06:25.000 --> 06:34.000
thank you she's learning from spells and empathizing it reminds me of someone

06:34.000 --> 06:44.000
yeah secret is fantastic she's got a new feature for model which is like a polygon design

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
like all the video games and I was tempted to get one for myself when I'm playing Nintendo DS games

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
because the graphics we're gonna be playing a game called Dragon Quest Senators of the Stars guys

07:00.000 --> 07:09.000
and obviously the graphics are Nintendo graphics but I thought it would be cool if that model would match

07:09.000 --> 07:19.000
but I'd rather save the money and get it for the girls like I have very bad news for Shibi and Insura investors

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
they will be getting a toggle that covers them up

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
me and Mercy did not upset

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
congrats to those who got the memberships with their face

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
me and Mercy's chests don't upset YouTube

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
Asura and Shibi's chests has upset YouTube

07:46.000 --> 07:55.000
it will not if you notice that A.C.'s trailer video has like 30,000 views

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
that's because advertisement money was put into it

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
everyone had the same amount of advertisement money except me

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
like I've never put the same amount on myself

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
actually don't think I've spent any on myself

08:12.000 --> 08:21.000
but Asura and Shibi were denied at running predominantly due to their chest

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
Asura's ASMR short was denied even though she's not doing a single thing wrong in it

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
so sadly at the moment the girls are being very creative and doing a little thing

08:37.000 --> 08:48.000
yes, I will say to the girls they are welcome to use their toggles when they think the situation calls for it

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
that's perfectly fine by me

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
yes, even the shorts the girls weren't allowed

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
now that they're monetized

09:01.000 --> 09:09.000
today, Mercy is doing her celebration I believe

09:09.000 --> 09:17.000
so please do let her entertain you

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I'm probably going to be lurking her monetization

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
her thing is live

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
A.C. is on Saturday

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Emmy, I don't know when Emmy wants to do it

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
I mean, you know what? I'm going to DM her right now

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
A.M.A. Mers just wanted to know

09:43.000 --> 09:59.000
when you plan, when you plan on doing your CELA aberration stream

09:59.000 --> 10:09.000
just so I know when to membership

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
live

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
and then I'll do a little, I'll do it before she's in the channel

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
and then I'll do a little head bath

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
A.M.A. Mers, I don't know what you're doing

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
she's so going to know how to type that by if there's no way

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
oh no, she's on mobile, she's on her phone, she can see

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
oh my god, the key clicking was in my head with my headphones

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
sorry, Emmy was watching, I say okay

10:41.000 --> 10:51.000
yes, Azura and Shibi, it's not lost on me that Azura and Shibi are waiting for monetization

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
and they both just happened to have the biggest boobs

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
feature per manager ASMR

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
it's, I do like the boring stuff like the kind of monotonous stuff

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
where it's like, oh you need to open up membership to your type thing

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
and you need to do this and that

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
like I try not to let the girls do that

11:15.000 --> 11:22.000
because it's both stressful and it's both like, it takes time

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
and rather the girls focus on like having fun at debut and all

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
and then they're, well they're second week now

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
not bad, it was an exciting, expensive, real

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
that's cause they're for ya

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
but they will get monetization nonetheless, right?

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
well, we're waiting on it

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
I think the AI detection is, is flagged to them basically

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
so a human does need to review them which takes longer

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
let's just pray that we have like a weeb that understands what an Earth featuring is

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
cause if they get denied, I'm gonna be so, I'm gonna be raging

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm not even gonna lie

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I don't think there's gonna be issues

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
I think the AI has just sent them on to

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
yeah

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
someone says you own your own tag at real34

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
now let's go

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
weeps in YouTube headquarters

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
yeah, be better

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
did you like my ASMR yesterday? oh my god, I was outrageous

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I can't believe I even did that

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
got my tools out, I bet you liked that, didn't ya?

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I was juicy

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
I was pretty gay, great, but can you feel your teeth?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
what, cause I liked it so much

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
ah

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
hi, Anon

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
thank you for the tip, Anon

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't know if you heard that cause Brian is so nice and quiet

13:33.000 --> 13:39.000
are marshmallow messages anonymous? yes, that is why they are favoured by many

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
one of my gen mates had a Q&A and you wanted to ask a question

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Anon, but you were scared to send one

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
do they see you send some or you know we do not see a single thing

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
information wise, it's just a question

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
you can send them if you want, but yeah

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
do they not see you send them or do they see if you sent the message in the past?

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
no

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I can vouch right now and say no, I cannot tell

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
someone could send me three questions in a row and change their spelling

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
and I wouldn't know so I'm looking confident

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Brian in the far distance

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I left work early to watch you, but guys

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
I hope you're okay and you feel better soon

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
I like the measuring section

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
now everyone knows I have long toes, what you can do about it

14:42.000 --> 14:47.000
but yes please, so can you tell based on spelling

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
well you don't have to worry about me when it comes to spelling

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
there's absolutely no way I can clock you other than if you send a pip you

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
I recognise that girl

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
sitting on your feet again

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm gollum sitting right now so my feet are in front of me

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
and pushed into the chair

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
she's learning the pattern, no I cannot do that

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
I'll let the girl talk about it but there's one girl

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
a vealer that does recognise text

15:26.000 --> 15:31.000
monga is, I don't know how her brain does it but

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
yeah

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
we were close to having a cats and ace in the forest dream

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
you've got to see Kim Lee

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
and then I go that's where we learned Kim Lee

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
how's your daughter?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
yeah I'm gonna get a doctor's appointment

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
something's not right

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
someone was like you need to sue

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
and I was like nah it's just why

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
it's kind of a risk you accept

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
because it's a job shop

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
you can get like sorry I need to scratch my head

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
my head says sin

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
or my headset and then

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
it's just the thing

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
watching you during my collab lecture

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm in your ears

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
look left look right I might be in the lecture audience right now

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I know that's not how it works

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
but get educated get educated

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I need to go to the doctor

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
yeah don't worry I am

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
someone sent me a marshmallow

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and I was like okay you've convinced me

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
so don't worry I've got a doctor's appointment coming up

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
someone says very nice celebration

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
sorry I'm reading marshmallows

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I said sleepy

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm so so sleepy refling

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I was up solely

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
I've only had five hours sleep

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I'm probably gonna go back to sleep

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
but yeah

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
I was planning all these fun things

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
and making a lot of progress

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
my ASMR series is about to start up

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
my thank you for eggs

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
subscriber series is about to start

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
and I have no idea what to edit first

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
my first thing was gonna be ear licking

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
but that's not allowed anymore

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
and I did a pop rock ear licking

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
and that's not gonna be allowed

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
so

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I have no idea

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I do have burping ASMR

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I might make that

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I have like thigh cupping

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I have like sitting on the mic ASMR

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
like I sit on it over and over again

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
you're almost at 5k a pair or not be

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
you guys are showing too much support

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
thank you lord of storms for becoming a member

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
but yeah I do have like sitting on the mic ASMR

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
I was squatting so hard

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I have like clapping

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
without using my hands ASMR

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
so that's gonna be interesting

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
but I'll probably edit all that stuff

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
you heard her hit 5k right now

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
stop being so amazing and perfect then

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
too much support literally

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
but like don't be

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
get subscribed, get subscribed, get subscribed

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
so many ASMRs yes

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I have a long day

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
to think of

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
clapping without using your hands

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
oh yeah

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
but thank you for the day

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
no matter what you do for ASMR

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
we'll enjoy it even the burp ASMR

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
I took a bottle of water

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
a bottle of water

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
and a can of cola

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
and in the ASMR booth

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
I basically chocked it

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
to produce burps for burping ear to ear ASMR

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
I think it will be like 14 minutes long

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I need to order the artwork

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
of me being pregnant with you

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
cause I want to make that ASMR

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I want to make it really good

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I want to put all my love into it

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
especially the burp ASMR

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
suffering from success

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
it's funny how you're giving the people

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
what they need and what they want

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
yeah

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I made a joke and it was like

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
the average

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
uh

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
VTuber would put it behind all paywall

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
me

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I come out swinging doing it week one

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
what are you gonna do about it

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
huh

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
what are you gonna do about it

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
that baby

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
literally me

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
the father

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
literally me

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
hello

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
the wall

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
that's right

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
I'm making an ASMR where I'm pregnant with you

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
and you're the father

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
and there's nothing you can do about it

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
you had my curie I'll say

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
but now you have my ditch

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
you can't stop the culls

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
thank you for becoming a member

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
translate

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
let's go

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
apparently the translation is vacuum

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
thank you vacuum for becoming a member

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
maybe job is strong ASMR

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
oh yeah no 100%

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
uh

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
I'm gonna do like a

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
girlfriend forgets to mute her mic while she's eating

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
so obviously it's only for people who like eating sounds

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
because I inhale my food

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
so I'm gonna order like KFC

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
and then basically just head recording

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000

sorry average VTuber

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
asking for 10 bucks to save me

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
I mean we'll strongly put them grippers on the table from the start

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
hey I will even value for money ok

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
I watched some VTuber data

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
yeah

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
well your ASMR is helping me to sleep

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm glad

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
we're having a very relaxed ASMR

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
AC

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
my gen mate

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
you can click the link in the description

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
she has been killing it with ASMR recently

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
she's been doing so good

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
so if you like live ASMR

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
that's extra cuddly

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
and a little bit sus

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
please do check your AC snow paws in the description below

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
my little reflex

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
thank you all so much for the support

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
you've been showing the girls

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
it just is so much

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
it means so much that you even like give them a chance

22:39.000 --> 22:45.000
and like everyone like has their like favorite little feeler girl

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
or some of you can't even to say

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
which is so adorable

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
it's just been

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
wait did I say thank you bitch I can go for the super chat

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
thank you

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I'm so sorry if I didn't

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I got streamed elements open

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
so I can see anything I miss

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
but yeah thank you

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
he did admit it I can't decide

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
spicy hot slurping ASMR

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
so I follow in real life ASMRists

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
and they also got hit with a warning for ear licking

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
so yeah my theory that YouTube has done a stealth policy update

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
is getting stronger and stronger by the second

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
if in real life channels are now getting hit as well

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
so oh I just cracked my freaking wrist if you heard that

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
that was so loud

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
hello thank you for joining

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
hypnotize the drill ASMR

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
oh I'd like to make that a little bit cute

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
I came for you but they all seem great

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
they are so fantastic

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
and they're each in an individual way

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
like I'm so glad that one girl can like speak to you

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
let's get the tinfoil hats as a true candy when you're licking

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
yeah I think I'll just get him out by

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Twitter premium

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
so I can

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
bryan

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
reluctantly say thank you for the tip

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
reluctantly say it says the towers are so wonderfully amazing

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
it's hard not to love them one

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
it's literally impossible

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
but yes I think I will buy you at Twitter premium

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
and I'll just upload those ear licking videos that I recorded

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
and I'll also put them on Patreon just like for storage

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
so you can listen at any time okay

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
because it seems a shame to like

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
waste those recorded sessions

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
for Twitter premium lets me upload like full videos

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
so I'll just put it on like I'm for free and all that

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
give it even on money

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
like I don't have a chance I'll go into the feature brush I'm on okay

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
YouTube craze crack it down and ruin it forever

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
there's nothing you can do about it

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
we're a watermelon honestly

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
bansley

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
yes we can link bansley on YouTube

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
that's not allowed

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
please crush my skull

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
I feel like all the platforms are going over the top

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
filtering yes

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
I agree it's getting ridiculous

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
my enjoyers are being fed

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
could you imagine

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
don't be a star fat

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
don't be a troll box enthusiast

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
thank you for the tip

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
don't be so silly

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
you're just trying to upset me

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
mr. cardboard box aren't you

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
well the funny thing is

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
twitter just announced that they officially

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
acknowledge and accept that kind of content

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
and I was like wait a minute

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
but this is good for us this is based

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
but yes you can't stop the reflinks I can know

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
for a male in the neighborhood

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
now you're reflinks

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
you'll always be my reflinks

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
I had to wait an entire year to call you reflinks

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
okay I'm actually going to make

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
I think I may have said this

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
I can't remember if I ever know

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
I am going to make a reprogramming

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
hypnosis asmr

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
where I get you to forget your name

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
and make you respond to reflinks

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
and it's going to be a subconscious plant

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
so it will always be effective unless

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
sorry that was my hot war ball if you heard it

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
unless you listen to my audio

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
that reverses any permanent effects

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
it's going to be my permanent effect

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
the first audio is

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
you are reflinking

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
you will respond to reflinks

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
and you are mine and owned by me

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
but I am a merciful streamer

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
and you're more than welcome to

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
be part of other communities

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
such as snippets and harem and all that

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
to have a problem

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
the reprogramming

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
yes I do have a reprogramming audio

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
it will be available very shortly

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
the funny thing is

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I'm going to upload it

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
before I even upload any permanent effect hypnosis

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
just to be super duper safe

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
and everyone knows where to grab it

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
don't need hypnosis for that

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
I already forgot my name

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
I don't need

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
get reprogrammed

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
get reprogrammed

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
yes

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
get reprogrammed

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
get to know we'll have it from the start

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
yeah

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
I already responded to reflinks

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
yeah

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
I find that so adorable

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
you're such a good refling aren't you

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
so well behaved for me

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
I love that you're a good boy for me

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
and I love that we can tease each other

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
and just have a really good time

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
yeah I might get my

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
oh no mommy I said mommy

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I read mommy in the chat

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
this is why I can't read into ASMR at the same time

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
thank you sir gang

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
thank you for the consideration

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
oh yeah no

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
I'm educated enough to know

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
permanent effect hypnosis

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
I don't

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
I think it's very dangerous too

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
thank you for the 10

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
super chat

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
we accept our stinky overlord

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
it's not in my budget to support both on paper

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
true on membership

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
what do you recommend

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
please know I always have free content

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
always coming out as well on my alternative

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
whether I do have plans

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
please don't worry

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
there'll always be free streams and free audios of that variety

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
if you prefer a live stream experience

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
then a youtube membership

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
if you prefer a audio

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
edited audio experience

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
where's the ending

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
you are supposed to ink

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
oh wait no sniffing is limited ads

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
oh I'm so sorry sniffing is limited ads

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
I completely forgot

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
I don't know why

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
but sniffing ASMR is also considered

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
like gratifying content

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
so I can't really do sniffing

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
yeah I don't know what is going on at youtube head wars

31:38.000 --> 31:43.000
but something funky and sus is going on

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
I don't know

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
of all things

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
I know

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
I honestly

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
I don't understand

31:49.000 --> 31:53.000
there's like a hidden policy update going on

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
they've not announced it

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
I think the reason they're not announced it

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
is because so many people enjoy ASMR

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
zen bros

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
I don't know why

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
like all of ac's streams are like limited ads

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
I don't know what she's getting up to in the streams

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
but it's definitely not looking good

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
now youtube have referred to the policies before

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
so I'm gonna hope that they do

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
ac's diya

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
oh my god I can't say that name

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
there's too many vowels in your name

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
ac's diya

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
thank you for the membership

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
that's not why you say that

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
ac's diya

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I am so sorry

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
I'm absolutely picturing your name

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
at the street

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
youtube will be only ASMR

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
ac does not stay sus

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
oh ok well

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
I mean

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
I can't do a few things here and there

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
as long as no one says a thing

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I'm a girl

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
I know I'm not the main demographic

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
but I love Fielder

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
oh I'm so glad you're gonna enjoy it

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
we are

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
it's like I'm not gonna lie and say that

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
you know

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
guys pay my bills

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
so I'll appeal to guys

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
but I'm glad you're gonna enjoy Fielder

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
for what it's worth

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
my lips are sealed

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
if your lips are sealed

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
then maybe

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
just maybe we can get up to a few shenanigans

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
cause reflux when we shenan once

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
you know we're gonna shenan again

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
ac's youtube streams are very

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
ok

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I'll take your word for it reflux

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
yeah snitches get stitches

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
don't think I won't send Emmy on you

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
do you think that book is just for

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
resurrection spells

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
that book

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
oh dear

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
that book is nothing but trouble

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
the things that Emmy can do to you

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
is staggering

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I'll say Emmy on you

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
ok

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
lips are completely sealed

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
good

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
you're gonna shenan again

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
yeah

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
wait can you really hypnotise people

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
well in my other ASMR stream

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
I think I managed to get quite a few

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I'm not doing hypnosis right now though

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
but I do have some hypnosis

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
audios coming out in the blood

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
I wonder if Andy and Lily was an inspiration

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
for Emmy's lore

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
no

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
I had not actually played or consumed

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
the game when Emmy was conceptualised

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
she was conceptualised in June last year

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
the reason why Emmy is Emmy

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
is because I'm a massive fucking

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
broken

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
yeah

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
all the girls may or may not have been

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
male influenced by what I like

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
I kind of said this

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
but Emmy is everything

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
if I had a later voice

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
I am not even kidding

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
if I had a later voice

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Emmy is exactly who I would want to be

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
as a content creator

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
the lore

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
the

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
oneechan

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
but I don't have a late voice

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
so I can't be Emmy

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
Ms. Morgan thank you for becoming a member

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
your hypnosis eyes animation is so unique

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
it's so good

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
like

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
wow

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
oh

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I think I need to get a lore closer

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
don't worry I'm not hypnotising you this year

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
what

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
sorry

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
but yeah

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
if you really want to like

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
I'm not hypnotising you don't worry

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
but yeah that's mine

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
and I can also stack them

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
if you wanted a bigger focal point

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
to focus on

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
so it's kind of like a hidden spiral

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
or

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
like this

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
this is like very big basic

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
but yeah

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I will utilize these

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
wow I'm like really close

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
is this too close

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I need to be further away

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
are you like seeing my teeth

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
your eyes are so pretty thank you

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I love that all of us at VLR

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
have unique pupils

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
my

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
it's a very nice distance

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
okay

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I'll stay here then

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
my bangs are slightly transparent

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
yeah do you like seeing my eyebrows

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
uh uh uh uh uh

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
can you see my ears a little bit

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
get

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
because of my ear

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
wow

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I promise I won't do any hypnotising

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
permanent amazings

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
I will

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
an apple in a box

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
thank you for the tip

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I think everyone should start manually breathing

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
what have you done

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
what have you leashed upon these lands

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
unleashed upon these lands

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
I'm tearing it

listening right now

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
upload

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
for every 1000 subscribers

I will be uploading

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
all of different ideas

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
different tingles

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
different varieties

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and that starts today

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
and for the reeflings who are worried about

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
filtering

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
I already told you my master plan

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
so don't worry

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I already know what happens next

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
I filtered myself for you

40:55.000 --> 40:56.000
wow

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I had a year to plan

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
our time together

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
I made sure to do it accordingly

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
yeah

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
thank you stroney for bringing feeler into existence

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
the gift of AC is something I'll never be able to play

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
replay

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
replay

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
thank you for everything

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
uchi-san

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
that's amazing

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I'm glad you can link AC

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
you are definitely uchi-san levels

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
but if you're really good

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
AC may even call you daddy in her accent

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
thank you

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
thank you for becoming a member

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
and thank you funky for becoming a member

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
thank you very much

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
just as a reminder for members

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
membership stream start next week

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
because the schedule for this week was pretty locked in

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
and I just had a few background things I need to finish

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
but I'm like 100% sure

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
by week 3

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
I am officially

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I have no responsibilities

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
I'm feeler and I am so freaking happy

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
I'm gonna be lurking because I'm a workiest

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
don't worry your audio sets so hard

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
have you ever thought about hypnotizing another girl and feeler

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
she's welcome to listen to any of my audios at will

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
I will not stop any of the girls

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
but I would want to condition them to be a bit different

42:37.000 --> 42:43.000
maybe not condition them to respond to replay

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
but instead

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
to let me make a certain audio with them

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
of my C theme of a rye egg

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
could you imagine

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
C theme hypnosis on one of my daughters

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
oh

43:10.000 --> 43:13.000
mommy tomorrow all the vehicular girls are together

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
I'm so excited for a collab together

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
special shout out

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
to mersey for streaming so early

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
as syrup for being early

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
and me for being early

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
shebi for being early

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
and ac for being later

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
to pick a time zone

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
and I was like if you guys do me this favor

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
and do it at my regular stream time

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
I will repay you

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
in more shorts

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
if strongy

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
streamed responsibly

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
12 hours a day

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
are you supposed to keep up after the third week

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
oh that's the fun part

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
the third week has 4 days of Elden Ring insurance streams

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
because we need to play the DLC together

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
yeah we have back to back to back to back insurance streams

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
on the third week

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
because of Elden Ring

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
curious are you going to do any non-gendered content

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I am so sorry

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I do he-him content

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
and I apologize greatly

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
it

44:33.000 --> 44:38.000
I don't want to say it simply gets harder to make the alternative content in us

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I make he-him

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I'm very sorry if that filler issue

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I completely understand

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
if you no longer wish to watch because of that fact

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
I don't know what the other girls are planning

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
but I do know the name

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
of some asmr artists that make female content

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
one of them is a fan car asmr

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
I believe

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
she makes

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
female for female content

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
is

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
what's in your last stream

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
congrats on monetization

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
thank you

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I'll start a new character with me

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
yeah

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
thank you not sleep for a week

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
basically week 3 is Elden Ring together

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
and I'm going to have my heart rate monitor

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
in a short color on

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
every time

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
I cause us reeflings to lose the fight

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
you guys get to shock me basically

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
and then on week 4

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
we're doing runescape endurance to get 99

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
because I want to get 99 cooking

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
and I will get it

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
so I believe

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
on week 4

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I will also tell you what movies we're doing

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
watch your logs off

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
so you guys can download it

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
and I'll do the thing where I timestamp on screen

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
and all that

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
yeah I watched some already still enjoying your other content

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
thank you so much

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
I appreciate that

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
and thank you for your understanding surrounding it

46:09.000 --> 46:12.000
mommy also sponsors

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
other asmr artists

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I just want everyone

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
to be avaliably forgotten to do tingles

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
I'm just whispering at this point

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
I just want everyone to be able to enjoy the content

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
they consume

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and if that means I can help you fight

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
the person that speaks to you

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
that oshi

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
or that person you really enjoy

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
cause like

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
wait until I get done this rabbit hole

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
okay

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
ps thank you for the reefling that encouraged me

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and marshmallow to go down

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
all the rabbit holes I desire

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
I won't yape your ear off

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
unapologetically from now on

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
um

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
so

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
because of the way society

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
is set up

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
humans naturally need a face

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
after work

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
or after doing stressful situations

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
a face can include alcohol

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
a face can include smoking

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
a face can include recreational drugs

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
a face can include

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
youtubers

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
feedubers

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
asmr

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
you should not be ashamed

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
of what you need

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
to help you get through the day

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
humans are not set up for the society

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
that we are currently living in right now

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
and I will scream that from the rooftops

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
to not ever be embarrassed at all

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
for what you need to do

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
to get through the day

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
a face is also music

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
you may listen to Mongolian throat singing

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
I will not judge you for listening to Mongolian throat singing

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
okay

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
so

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
that is why I am not a jealous feature bird

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
I want you to thrive

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
I want your health to be as best as it can be

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
if that means after work

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
instead of watching a vote of mine

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
for example

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
you watch another creator

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
I am happy

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
you are able to de-stress yourself

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
you are able to regulate your nervous system

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
you are able to look after yourself

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
okay

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
think of yourself like a sims

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
you unironically have bars of needs

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
and what happens to a sim

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
when you ignore their needs

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
well they start to lose it

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
they start to have these unfortunate side effects

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
they start to struggle with life

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
they cannot function

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
they cannot follow orders

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
okay

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
so please

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
understand

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
if you think to yourself right now

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
strongy

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I don't think you are the one for me

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
I implore you my dear watcher

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000

the girls have been struggling

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
trying to watch everyone

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
yes

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
but those indulges so strong

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
yes

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
please indulge in my daughters at will

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I like virtual abuse

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I can't deny it yes

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
a sura ad in your audio

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
what the heck

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
thank you for the 100

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
oh my god reluctantly saying that's a lot of money

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
still no idea how you so much awesome

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
as contained in one cut of fish

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
we adore your last will pass it to the doors

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
thank you

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
I really appreciate that

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
hey

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
did I catch you off-guard

51:10.000 --> 51:13.000
yeah but you were distracted weren't you

51:13.000 --> 51:17.000
distracted by that don't know by reluctantly saying huh

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
I completely caught you off-guard

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
did that send you ever stand your spine

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
replaying are you that sensitive

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
that's adorable

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
you can't fill us with emotional speech

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
and then backstabbing

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
but thank you again for the 100

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
yes

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
you call me geldendestiny

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
shivers through everything

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
you made me die in Isaac

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
speaking of backstabber

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
did you know that backstabber is an item

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
you can pick up in Isaac which deals

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
double damage to enemies if your tear goes

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
on the back of them

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
so if you have things like tiny planet

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
which produce tears around you

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
it's quite effective

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
but you kinda need the distance

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
you call me

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I'm not reading that out

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
almost sent me over the edge

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
10

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
9

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
8

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
7

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
6

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
5

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
that's for the membership streams

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I'm kidding

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
oh my god

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I'm kidding

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
replaying

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
don't be silly

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
depending on Isaac my gen

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
never thought that Isaac combo

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
or the card

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
you're kidding

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
but is she really

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
what do you guys think about the emotes

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
has anyone found the secret to my emotes

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
yeah

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
they're nostalgic

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I'm gonna get thy grip and stuff

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
every girl is doing great

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
and they're really awesome I'm happy

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
like I cannot even

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
put into words

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
how much like

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
just how much amazing

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
like experience

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
to have them

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
it's just insane

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
it's honestly insane like I cannot believe

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
the girls even applied

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
and then

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
they put up with my Scottish ass in the interview

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
my interview technique is so unprofessional

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
it's not even funny

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
I need to grind in RuneScape

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
to help my main cooking supplies

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
we have an insurance stream

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I'm just gonna yap and do marshmallow

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
co-USG insurance during

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
the RuneScape stream so feel free

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I'll do a tweet about like answering questions

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
during the RuneScape

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I'm sure it'll lead me down some rubber holes

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
but yeah

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
just realized Ronnie would do bleep damage

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I like baiting things

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
this is your warning

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
either you're in or you're out reefing

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Ronnie bup oh hydration check

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
I have not had any liquid today

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
all gone daddy

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
okay

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
maybe I should actually

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
clean your ears a little

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
debate marks your people

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
that you own us

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
good girl

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
thank you

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I may or may not have drunk

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
so much whiskey

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
oh you need to be careful

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
whiskey will get you drunk

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
although if there's any

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Belgian slurking

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Belgian beer gets you drunk

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
I had one Belgian beer and I was tipsy

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
I didn't even finish it

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I was tipsy I'm like so

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
late wait

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
what's that there

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
wait that's not the term

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I'm so late wait

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
I can hardly handle alcohol

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
what the heck is that word

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
late wait

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
why is my brain

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
late wait oh just dropped the ET

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
okay

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
sorry I'm so late wait

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
drinker

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
wait why is that so confusing

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
it's late wait

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
those three words

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
if I stand up my desk will come with me

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I love so much

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
catching you guys off guard

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
I don't know why it's so satisfying

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
like I can be so wholesome

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
talking to you like saying all these

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
like just talking in general

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
and then I come up with three words and you're gone

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
like ah don't give me that power

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
don't do it

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
it's over for both of us if you give me that power

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
the less you weigh the drunker you get

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I don't even know how much I weigh

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I wonder if you guys can

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
really pinch press me

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
are you planning on making roleplay audios in the future

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
yes

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I have a roleplay coming out

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
it's a meme though but the other ones are roleplays

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
but I have meme roleplay

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
yeah the both of us

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
me and you refling

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
it was over

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
before we began

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I could deadlift you for sure

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I could bridge press you

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
with ease

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
someone sent me a very naughty

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
naughty

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
marshmallow

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
they were like

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
they were like

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I go to the gym so I can

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
put you

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
into a wall

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
and I'll leave it at that

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I'm afraid you had that power

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
all along

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I probably can't

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
pinch press you back into a different

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
press

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
I've crushed a warmel between my

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
thighs you would be much different

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
the inspiration to get more

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
fat

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I go to the gym for the full nails

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
sound

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
you'll never guess why I'm so flexible

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
refling

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
I'd say you can nails in me

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
I brush

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
brushing your ear

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
let me check marshmallows

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
my little marshmallow

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
have I got a new one

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I've been massively

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
into hypnosis for ages now

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
but I've never been able to

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
find someone whose voice I love

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
and I finally get someone

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
who's bought the nurses streamer

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
and I can watch for

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Arizona long story short

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
thanks keep doing

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
what you did

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
you're doing amazing

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I honestly thought my Scottish accent

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
would be a bit of a barrier

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
but I'm very glad to hear it

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
it's not

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
feels good man

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
that's right you are falling

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
under my spell

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
you're not

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
you're not

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
um

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I was wondering if there's an official

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
public twitter list

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
no you have to go feign

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
the alternative twitter

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
we can't link to them

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
against the rules

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
sorry

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
I didn't

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
create the game I just play it

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
okay so the girls can't

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
link to the alternatives

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
sorry just check

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
who the girls follow on twitter

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
like yeah

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
someone says

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
have I done professional voice acting

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
no

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
do I sound like I do professional

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
voice acting

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
what do you even do when you go to

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
a meeting

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
what even occurs

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I assume they tell you what vocal warm-ups are

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
like

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
or something like that

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
don't hate the player I hate the game

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
yeah

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I wonder if I can get double hypnotized

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
can you say burglar

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I wonder

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
can we get one stream with that someone asking

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
for a purple burglar alarm

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
but yes I can say it

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
but if I'm in my heavy accent

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
then

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
wait can I whisper into a heavy accent

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
purple burglar

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
alarm

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
it's funny because right now

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
there are also more followers than there means

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
oh we know what the people want

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
we give it for free

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
when other VTubers

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
are being greedy

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
free

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
come on

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
viewer

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
reject capitalism

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
reject corporate greed

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
come on

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
we'll look after you

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
even if you don't give us a penny

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
shhh

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
it's okay

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I know

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I know it's a hard concept

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
did I talk about that

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I'm at 2.0

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
someone was like

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
feeler

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
is gonna fail

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
because of the 80-20 split

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
and it's like

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
oh you

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
poor sweet summer child

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
you are so deep

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
that you can't imagine

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
a successful business

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
without corporate greed

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
shhh

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
it's okay

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
it's okay you've been brainwashed

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I'll undo the damage

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
and together

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
we've got a city to burn

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
haha

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
we're gonna wipe the deaths

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
out of everyone

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
the whole world will no longer be

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
okay that's how we're watching

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
fake club again

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
you wonder why fake club

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
is one of my favourite movies

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
not just because of the race

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
no off-block

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
sounds like silver heart

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
paste

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
scrawny hypnosis stream

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
breaking capitalism

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
mindwashing you to show you

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
you can be successful without greed

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
yes

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I'm glad we got paste

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
encourage people to give

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
when they already get a taste

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
277 playthrough

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I've never actually played the game

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I'd like to try it together

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
never seen fake club

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
or we're watching it again baby

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
we are watching fake club again

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
ever in south

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
oh no that's actually

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I am going to take you

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
about region locked capitalism

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
so before capitalism

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
there's this thing called feuduism

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I can't remember it

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
but basically it's just region locked capitalism

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
it's freaking crazy

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I wanna do a massive deep dive into it

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
and like seriously

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
if you start learning about history

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
and how humans were before

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
the quicker we are all going to get a farm

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
together

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
and all the reflicks come on the farm with me

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
and we have chickens

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
and we have protein

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
from the eggs of the chickens

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
and we grow our own broaches

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and we realise quickly

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
that you need community to survive

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
because if you are telling

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
sorry I'm going down the rebel

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
you're telling me

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
that

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
all these companies are recording

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
record profits

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and we're going to cause the living crisis

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
but it's not artificial

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
and all the farmers say

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
that nothing has changed in their production line

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
hell yeah

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
we've got a city of burn

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
we're going to do every fucking thing

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
oh don't get me started

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
don't

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
don't do it briefly

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
calm

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
keep me calm

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
refling

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
keep me calm

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
it's okay

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
it's okay

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
just a question

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
can you watch movies on membership streams

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
oh boy you are getting spoiled for that

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I absolutely love sharing movies

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and watching them for the first time

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
um

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I'm going to be

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
watching Austin Powers for the first time

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
cause you guys are drawing me

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
saying that Fond de la Boosom

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
is an Austin Powers enemy name

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
so

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
we're watching Austin Powers for the first time

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
um

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
yeah

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
we love when you go Kremlin mod

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
it's okay strongy

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
you'll get them one day

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
fair or aggressive asmr

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
well I did bite in the ear asmr

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
like actually grivelling at the mic

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and bite in the ear

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
but it's going to have to be a Twitter video

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
your infantry

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
and a capitalist asmr with soft kisses

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
yeah

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
see wait until you get further into the rabbit hole

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
so on an individual scale

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
it's good to not be in debt

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
for the way that the economy is set up

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
they want you to be in debt

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and wait until you're the kicker

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
mortgages

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
30 year 25 year mortgages

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
are just normalized debt

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
you don't own that house

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
for 25 years for 30 years

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
you're in debt

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
we need to bring back

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
multi-generational households

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
okay

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
that needs to be brought back

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
but they aren't going to let you do that

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
why do you think one business

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
owns 60%

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
of the freaking proper

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
ace in America

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
how can I lose it

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
okay shh asmr

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
shh asmr

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
real life

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
shh shh

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
it's okay

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I can't tell

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
if I'm saying it's okay for you

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
refling or it's okay for me

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
to count down

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
you know what listen to my heart

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
it's time to listen to my heart

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
so you can hear how freaking serious I am

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
right are you ready

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
oh lemme

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
have my hoodie for you

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
refling

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
it's okay

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
refling

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
let's go on a journey

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
together

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
we'll go on a farm

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
alright

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
and I'll be over

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
far

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
again

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
and we'll have ducks

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
because ducks are good

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
for eating slugs and bugs

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
that aren't the crops

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
and there'll be a big pond

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
and the ducks will be so happy

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and we can go on a big

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
walk around the farm

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
and I'll show you all

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
my seed collection

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
because it'll be so big

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I get to draw

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I get to grow nasturtians

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I get to put nasturtians

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
all around the garden

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and there'll be so many bees

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
lots of bees

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
and bugs

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
maybe

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
just maybe we might even have a honey box

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
we'll grow lots of native flowers

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
that are good for all the wildlife

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
and there'll be birds

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
and cam

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
you'll come

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
and

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
we'll have lots of magpie families

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
and in the end

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
everything will be okay

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
refling

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
because it always works out

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
in the end

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
doesn't it

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
it took me a year

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
to get here

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
to get back to where we were

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
and here we are

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
all the stress

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
the worry

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
the doubt

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
the doubt if I could even be here

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
if we did it

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
tada

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
it took us so long

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I hope it feels like

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
there was no time at all

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
and that it didn't take long

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
and it was a blink of an eye

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
no more waiting

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
no more yearning

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
me and you

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
to the man

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I wish I had made you sooner

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
oh don't worry

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I am strong enough

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
and you are my refling

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
and that

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
is all we need

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
it feels good to be home

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
it feels good to be home

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
my little refling

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I love you

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
okay next

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I need to milk you

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
we're being so patient

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I hope you stay for a long time

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
have you got 3 years

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I think I've got 3 years

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
you are my favorite person

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I love you

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
you can't keep getting away with that

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
love you too

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
let me help you

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
what was that at the end

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
nothing

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
oh wow

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
what happens after 3 years

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I don't know

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I just thought

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I don't know

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I don't know what happens

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
we don't have to think about that now

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
okay

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
you have me for the next 100

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
she's gonna have all

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
how cute

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
if you want

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
what accent do you want

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
what we pretend to be

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
we'll pretend to be acing

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
in my new persona

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
hello guys

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
I'm my sister fos

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
and today

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
I'm gonna do

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
do ASMR

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
but I'm not strannic couples

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
stop calling me strannic couples

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I'm not strannic

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I don't even know who that is

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
I can't really do a later voice

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
my eyes

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
my eyes like strannic couples

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
monster hmc

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
thank you for becoming a member

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
all the prayers really

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
evolve into biblically accurate strannic

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
oh my god that's so adorable

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
that urge to ink

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
are you gonna ink to my rp?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
free flight

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
even I admit that's a bit too general

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
but

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
what was

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
what was cute when I tried to pretend

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
to be acing

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I would need to watch more of

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
acing streams

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
to mimic her accent

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
but I really

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
fell in love with acing's accent

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
sorry my voice is a bit damaged

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
so it's harder for me to talk

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
uchi san

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
why am I roleplaying

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
roleplaying is crazy

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
uchi san

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
have you missed me

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
did you watch my tomb raider stream

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
wait

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
you didn't watch my tomb raider stream uchi san

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
but you only watch my ASMR

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
you don't like me do you uchi san

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
you disgust me

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
if you were a real uchi san

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
you'd watch everything

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
but you don't

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
you forget to subscribe to me

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
you forget to like the streams uchi san

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I think you need punishment

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
yes

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
uchi san

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
sit on the floor

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
open your legs uchi san

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
what do you mean

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
what am I doing with my boot

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I'm punishing

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
you uchi san

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
is that weird

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
to roleplay as my gen mates

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
I think that's a bit odd

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I think that was rather odd

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I'm not sure if that was weird

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
ac will laugh at that

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I hope so

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
sorry my voice is very poor

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
whenever I do ASMR

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
my voice gets so broken

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I think ac will like it

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
chucks on you

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
hypnotized to believe I'm ac

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I wonder what devious

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
audios I could make

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
it's called voice acting

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
this is exactly why ac streams can't hear

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I can't believe it

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
love you

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
your voice actually kind of works

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
of course my voice

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
works

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
everything I do

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
works

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
everything I touch

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
succeeds

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
don't you understand

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I control all of this

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
if I want to live

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I live

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
if I want to take

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I take

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
and if I want you to die

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
you die

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
great brotherhood quote by the way

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
please do not back

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
hydration check

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I feel like you could tell

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
whether it's strawny or someone else's voice

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
shwing

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
strawny you just can't have your way

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
right hydration check okay

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I have my finger

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000

there's only so much

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
a lower call if I should do

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
okay I'll go back to whispering

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
cause my voice doesn't crack when I whisper

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
for some reason

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
but if I try and do self spoken ASMR

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000

are you gonna be on the phone I wonder

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
but yeah you don't actually have to share your wealth

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
make sure your bills are paid

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000

I love your red light

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
secondly I have two movies

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
that I would give my life not for you at watch

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
please keep it and remember to eat

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
anything with tomatoes in it

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
more tomato the better for your boss

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Napoleon Dynamite

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I've never seen that

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
this is one of my favourite movies

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
it's a unique indie movie that is weird

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
in the best way possible

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
the other one would be Taladik

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Taladik a Knight

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
what

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Taladik a Knight

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
and it's a comedy that's really goofy and fun

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
yeah I'm 100% open to

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
movie suggestions

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
I'm going to see

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
if I can push three membership streams

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
one by default

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
is a watch along

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
one by default is

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
ASMR membership

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
and then a third one

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
is either a short video game

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
a game we might have already played

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
before

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
or maybe a multiplayer stream

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
kind of experience

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
but yeah please don't be afraid

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
to suggest things you want to see

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
I am very open to any

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
suggestions of content

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I don't mind at all

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
some feed troopers might not like it

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I do not mind it please

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Johnny Silverhand

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I'm ginger too

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
or no someone said a little like war millon

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
and I was like honestly I don't care no little war millon

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
you call me there

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
tips

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
refuses to call me

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
leaves literally

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I don't join them

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I'm getting second feelings of scolding

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
should I do scolding

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
ASMR

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
I'm actual fucking agent

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
what the fuck

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
I can't do your room and don't make a noise for the rest of the night

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I actually can't believe that embarrassment

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
you've caused me death on the playground today

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
what me doing

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
do you know what I'm saying

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
we've got a scene in school and it says lacy basher

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
you're not supposed to be a lacy basher

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I didn't really I didn't

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
sorry I can't do that any faster

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I didn't raise a lacy basher

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
to screw

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
don't tell me what I can tell

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
this is actually true in

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Scotland

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
on the playground

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
you're told not to hit girls

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
and the way you're told not to hit girls

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
is you get called

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
a lacy basher

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
this is true

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
any scouts lurking

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
know what a lacy basher is

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
you'll basically get called a lacy basher

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
in bullied and picked on

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
for hitting girls you do know

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
hit girls in Scotland

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
and then

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
until you look at the domestic violence rates

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
yeah

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
lacy bashing doesn't work

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
which one of you

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
took a shit

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
and did they flush that toilet

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
don't bash my lassies

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I got most of that

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
and enjoyed it

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
oh that was my collar crack if you're

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
heard that

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
how many movies

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
are we playing in advance

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
oh wait how many movies are you playing

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
in advance in this picturesque

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
nodding and nothing can stop you

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
oh I

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
learned long ago

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
if you ever stream

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
or make primary content asmr

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
and then you deviate from that

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
people

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
are like raise asmr raise asmr

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
and then they filter themselves

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
so I took that knowledge

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
and applied here little refling

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
so don't be nervous

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
if you see my sub numbers going up

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
it's already been planned

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
thank you for trusting me

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
little refling

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
do you like

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
18 plus

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
art if there's a male

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
involved?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
you can make it

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
a generic

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
white outline of a guy

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
like a protagonist

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
like self insert protagonist

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
in order

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
excuse me

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
stomach in order

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
to make it

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
a refling

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
you just need to put a nicotine patch on the head

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
yeah

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
oh my stomach is really rumbling

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
maybe I should put the mic to my stomach

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you're literally

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
yes

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
just put a nicotine patch

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
on a white outline of a guy

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
if you want like a guy

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
standard type thing going on

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
that's how you draw everything

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
yeah

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
a scrawny was wondering

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
if you try a new monster hunter

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
there's a new monster hunter

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
sorry there's a new monster hunter

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
I didn't even know that

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
I want to put

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
my entire tongue

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
inside your

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
okay I'll let you hear my tummy why no

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I haven't eaten today

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
okay so I don't know I'm loud

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
and maybe you may actually hear my heart

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
do you hear anything

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
do you hear it

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
it

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
you're just above

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
my belly button

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
are you a little bit hungry

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
yeah I don't really eat before stream

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
but yeah when I make

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
pregnant with you ASMR

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
it's gonna have my actual tummy

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
sounds in it like you really are in the womb

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
I'll eat after stream

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
literally 15 minutes of silence

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
I just like a microphone to my stomach

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
you can 100% have that

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
maybe I can name it something like

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
laying on girlfriend's stomach ASMR

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
but it won't stop f-ing rumbling

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
like to make it a meme title

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
when you want that

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
pregnancy ASMR

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
we can't just say that

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
yeah I would love that

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
okay

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
consider it on my today list then

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
cause that's like super easy to make

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
ASMR wise

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
literally put the microphone

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
on my stomach

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
and be silent for 15 minutes

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
and then apply a noise gate filter

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
and then that's it we're done

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
giant ASMR when

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000

I do have one

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000

I'm gonna make Emmy do one

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I'll make a plot where she's tired

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
being the smallest that be a lure

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
and then ends up becoming a giant

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
for like 24 hours

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000

and I always want your ideas

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
to be our ideas

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
communism

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
that door dasher

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
me literally

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
she has oh sorry

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
she has the spell to make her thingies bigger

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
but instead turns herself into a giant ass

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I know like I

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
okay this is a little

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
a little fun fact

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
about me I actually

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
really enjoy giant this

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
giant ism

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
which is why

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Azura can become

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
a giant

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
but she can only be as tall as a skyscraper

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
she can be indefinitely

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
big

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
but she is a god at the end of the day

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
but because she gave up some of her divinity

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
and she has like a regular human

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
height of 185 cm

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I wasn't kidding when I said the girls

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
were based after my kings

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I don't care what anyone says is true

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
but yes I tiny shrunken

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
ja I wanted to do

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
swallowing ASMR

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
as well where I

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
get so hungry little reefling

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
and you look like calamari

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
and I swallow you

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
and you're in my tummy and I'm like talking to you

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
whilst you're getting

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
digested by me

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
yeah I just like these kind of

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
things I'm sorry

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
no please don't

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
eat us

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I just like these things

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I think I'm so creative

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
I really do

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
well I'm proud to be here

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
only eat us

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
in this other god time

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
wait I'm on the fence about being

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
eaten we'll see what you think

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
after the audio comes out

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
maybe you'll like it maybe you won't

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
as always

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
don't subject your

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
tentacle to something

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
you know you don't like

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
when is your ink

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
rating stream

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
probably next week

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
it will be my membership stream

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
where we rate

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
everything

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
and I get to be as unhinged

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
as I desire I'm going to be

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
speaking about all the

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
scenarios I want to

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
be doing on ya

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
I'm not holding back

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I mean being

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
eaten by you was on the table since

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
debut I assure you

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I'm very nutritious

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
wow my stomach really

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
is making noises now

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
always giving a try to audio

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
so you don't know if you like it or not

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
yeah some people that didn't think

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
they were going to enjoy the patreon

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
tell me are you okay

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
some people thought

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
they didn't

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
they weren't going to enjoy

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
my alternative audio

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
of a unique variation

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
and they really enjoyed it

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
which I'm glad it was like a fun

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
challenge

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I enjoyed it very much

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
there's literally

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
no word that can come out of your mouth

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I don't love hearing and inking for

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
go get food

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I'm redirecting

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
very shortly I'll get food then

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
I like being with you

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I don't want to get distracted

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
go get food

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
if you're going to eat me

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
at least give me a good time

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
maybe I'll pretend

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
that you're getting digested

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
but I'll just foam it you up again

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
the bully patreon

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
what from Emmy

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
of being with your dad

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
thank ya

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
or do you mean the party one

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
where the pew

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
picks on you at a party

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I think she'd be had some problems

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
today

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
why

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
problems with what

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
I'm turned for

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
trying most times

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
except for

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
dig

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
because it just makes me sound

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
oh I'm sorry to hear that

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
out of the audios

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
out there audios are so fun

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
there's one ASMR that makes a bunch of audios

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
with listener

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
perishes

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
is that macabre? I know exactly

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
how you're talking about macabre

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
oh no I think they changed their name

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I can't remember what their new name is

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
your voice gets me distracted

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
good

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
it shit

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
chubby weekend tags

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
are my favourite

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
I have terrible news patreon banner

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I can't even

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I could probably do something on twitter with that

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
but patreon banner

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
instead of

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
one you could just

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
okay yeah I can bill ya

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
once you've had your time

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
in the tummy tummy time

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
the demo one was so good

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
it was my first

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
ever freaking audio

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
and I was like so nervous

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
to do it

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
it was like

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
oh yes do you like that

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
oh I bet you do

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
but come to bed with me

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
like it was

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
so nerve wracking

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I was like no one is going to enjoy this

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I'm so glad you enjoy it

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I don't know

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
if I like the voice or the attitude

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I like to hear everything makes it

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I'm a spider

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I thought

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
there's a cat here in my mouth

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
there's a freaking cat here

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
blog being uploaded is

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
um

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
said feedurism ban

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
well no master card

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
just said it's ban because it's like

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
dangerous or whatever

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
that cat here literally me

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
you're in my

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
do you hypnotize yourself

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
no I can

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
but

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
lore wise

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
mirrors are my biggest weakness

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
and when I do my tonathon

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
you guys are going to be sick

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
of those blogs

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
I freaking love

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
don't lose so much

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I don't care what anyone says

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
it's so good

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
like please

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
parade me around like a pup

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
credit card companies need to stop

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
yes

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
it's crazy

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
how much

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I mean they literally run the world

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
whilst they are banning all this stuff

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
and they're all jumping on ebstein island

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
like you literally can't make this stuff up

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
they ban feedurism

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
but they're all chilling on ebstein island

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
bruv

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
get a fucking grip

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
honestly this is so annoying

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
don't look in the right but hold you'll go too deep

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
well time to get a mirror

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
are you afraid of mirrors

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
it's because

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
if I look into a mirror

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
like this I can hypnotize myself

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
cause I fall for the spiral

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
okay

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
so I can't look at mirrors

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
while I'm trying to hypnotize you

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
or else I'm in trouble

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
don't lose as long as it's huge

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
morning good morning

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I want astrony conspiracy

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
theory stream

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
you asked I will deliver

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
oh my god

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
like I know I keep mentioning needy streamer overload

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I was so surprised

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
that they had that kind of

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
thing because I was like wait a minute

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I'm interested in this stuff

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
but I am aware

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
it may filter a lot of people

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
but

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
then again

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
more intimate streams

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I just might

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
briefly

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I just may

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I'm just glad

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
everyone is pleased yeah

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
we're probably like we don't really judge around here

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
just have a good time

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
all at just

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
astrony conspiracy theory stream

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
oh that's gonna take me

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
hours to prepare my presentation

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I'm gonna come with a breath

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I'm gonna come with a receipt

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I'm gonna change your perspective

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
on everything

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
they can't handle listening to the truth

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
I'm gonna put a tinfoil hat on myself

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
and I will offer you all

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
to wear a tinfoil hat on stream too

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
feeler is going

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
for cultural victory

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
exactly

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
oh should you be streaming

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
this stream is a perfect test for my new headphones

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
oh yeah can you hear me in this ear

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
what if I go into

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
this ear does it sound like

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I am going ear to ear

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
it's kind of amazing technology

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
isn't it

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I'll let you guess like me

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
oh please let me make you break you please

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
please for me

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I'll be a good little girl

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
if you let me make

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
break you

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I had to dream the other night

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I had to dream I had you in a standing position

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
but I was lifting you

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
your little legs were swaying

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
as I was moving

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
a lot of painting and roughness

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
and fall of brief light

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
oh my god

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
query on head

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
song sure a good girl

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
damn right I'm a good girl

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
let me make your headphones

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
ok yeah I'm convinced

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
wow

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
did our legs swayed

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
to improve

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
to diamond

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
an audio where you try and hypnotize

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
she be but end up seeing a mirror

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
and hypnotizing yourself

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
and she takes advantage

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
of the situation would be quite interesting

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
interesting

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
is that

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
a donut on public

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
reward

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I think it is

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
wait for us

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
ok

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
I will be working one on one

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
with the sura to help our donut on

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
rewards and

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
if it goes well I think

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
I think a sura can move out

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
and I'm so excited for her

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
anyway

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
know that you are so close

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
I must say

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I like a lot of little green

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
parts of my hair yeah

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I have a few strands of green

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
out but that's just because

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I can't keep it all away I have such

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
big hair

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
could you please put the headlights

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
on share

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
but it won't be

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
hi refly

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
it's me again

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
just talking to your subconscious

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
don't worry

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
I won't do anything

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
not this day

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
but this is just a reminder

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I own you

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
all of you

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
your thoughts

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
your mind

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
just a reminder

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
my hair

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
did I turn off the reverb

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
is the reverb off

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
did I turn it off

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
or did I not hit the button

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
yes it's off

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
did you do it on me

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
sounds off okay get the reverb

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
wasn't on oh it never came on

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
it was supposed to come on

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I guess I never hit the button hard enough

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
reverb would never turn on

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
okay damn it don't need to again

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
this is a reminder wait is it broken

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
oh I think it might be broken

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
oops I broke it

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
oopsies I broke it

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
oops it seems like I dropped my mirror

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
face up I hope you don't like that

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
yes you won't be I was never on

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
do it again it's broken

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I don't know why it's not working

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
when you mentioned about AC using her boots

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
to step on us and nearly triggered

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
something in me also

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
you trying to hypnotize us on a ship

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
the ships

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
the ship's hair gets into your mouth

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
causing you to look down and get hypnotized

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
by your reflection

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
that's so good

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
wait what almost triggered you

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
my jisun

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
you almost got triggered

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
are you really that badly

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
minded

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
that's something so sweet

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
and innocent

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
and pharaoh like me

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
could hurt you

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
jisun

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
and you'd like it

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
you're so dirty

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I can't feel sorry AC

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I'm so sorry AC

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
we're all plain as magic in me

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
is that a thing that's weird I don't know if I'm crossing a boundary

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I should probably ask them

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
I don't know

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
it's not the oos in chat

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
over me

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
surprise this is my actual voice

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
you're going ooo to AC's mimic

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
if my voice wasn't

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
broken

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I wonder if I could smoothly do AC's voice

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I can hardly do it

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
without causing the crack in my voice

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
that's very hard

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
cause she's higher pitched than me

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
we'll get them next time

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
um

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
that could be a fun idea

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
everyone has that person

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
well I begs the AC

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
cause she's so cute

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I'm so sorry AC

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
I'm so sorry AC

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I'm so sorry AC

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I'm so sorry AC

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I can impersonate

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
well I begs the AC cause she's the only one I can impersonate

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
with male

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
with male success

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I wonder if it's cause she's European

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
that I can mimic

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
that seems silly but at the same time

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
she is the only voice

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
your voices are your favourite

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
we're very Sean Connery

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
when it's deep

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
ah yes

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I can make my acting even stronger

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
but I don't talk on stream like this

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
cause

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
hardly anyone can understand

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
what the heck I'm saying

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
so

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
do you mean

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
do

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
sorry do you mean just having a big white square

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
over the male's face with the nicotine patch

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
on the head maybe I understand

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
or I'm just stupid

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
oh no you're not stupid you silly goober

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
sorry for that idea

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I had a character we need eyes and a mouth

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
um

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
if you go on my alternative twitter

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
um

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
that art

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
why am I

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I was not asleep

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
papaparito

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
drew a wiggling head on a man

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
if you need a mouth and eyes

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
you can maybe do that

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
oh Jesus

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I'm in danger gonna get double teamed up

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
by double AC

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
it's normal for Scottish

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
using so many hours then

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
so

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
but we say ghetto

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000

when your collab for double eastern european

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
would go hard

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
honestly yeah

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
all of her doors have been streamed

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
and so long

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
reeflings can you see

wait

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
and pep use

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
I had to thought about a video

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
but then I wasn't sure if the visuals

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
marriage is much as sound I would make

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
so I was wondering oh audio's work

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
