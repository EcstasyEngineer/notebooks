I don't know if we'll find a game in the regular mode because everybody's playing 2v8 right now

114
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,520
So we might be waiting a while to get into the game anyway. Okay. Well, it's gonna take 10 minutes

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Uh for me to be done

He's at the police car in the mid map a mid map police car

161
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,400
He's still chasing me. Leave me alone. I'm just a rubbish Claudette. I'm gonna bomb this generator. I just don't know

165
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
I'm gonna bomb your house

166
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
Please don't like it

167
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,200
Sally trying for your birthday game

168
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Oh the pipe bomb you promised

169
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,320
You reached that that special age where you get a special package here. Why do I keep hearing harpy?

170
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
I think I'm being chased, but I don't actually physically see him. No, he's uh, he's on me now

171
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,120
I hear so like wandering around like he didn't know what he was doing. Oh my god. Tell me we're literally so

172
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Is the heartbeat

173
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Why is he I think they heartbeat

174
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Oh, he's being nice

175
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,800
He's being nice. He wants to be friends. Wait, actually

176
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
at the police car

177
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,520
Wait, is that a stream sniper? Hi. Is that one of ours?

178
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,320
Maybe or maybe he just wait teabag multiple times if you're the stream if you're a stream sniper

179
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,400
Tell me what you're doing. I got a teabag anyway. Oh, I guess it's the only way he can communicate

180
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Hey

181
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Okay, break the pilot if you're a stream sniper

182
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,200
Okay, no, it's not that fast. It's not that fast spin around 360 if you are a stream sniper

183
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,880
No, you might not have healing not

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,440
What why is he being nice does he want a point

185
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,280
Some killers just want points for doing stuff like if they have a weird totem thing on

186
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,920
Where can we do gents then um

187
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,400
We're actually so attractive the killer doesn't even want to perish us

188
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Oh

189
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Ghostface is my husband

190
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
Guys no, yes

191
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,320
Oh, wait, someone came in and I had the last word

192
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Ha

193
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,280
Is it gonna start I can tell him to I can tell him to hook me. It's okay

194
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,360
Is it gonna start slaughtering us when we try to leave is that his and maybe he has perks for the end game?

195
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,120
And this is like a oh, I'm a nice killer and then as soon as you go open the gates everything is like locked off

196
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
You can't do anything

197
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
Yeah, it's a ruse. I can't believe it. It's broke. You all look like new players. Don't say such things

198
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,160
We'll forget we'll forget and pay because we look like baby

199
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh, wait, yeah

200
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,320
Oh, he's coming. No, we're actually pros on our other accounts

201
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Working guys know it. She's my wife

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm working baby

203
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,360

Then everyone doing the colons as well. I'm like, oh miss my soul. Love. That's the door. It's so nice to see

209
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920

We're done

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
I don't know what uh

214
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,080
Oh, wait, my window is open and I can smell someone's make dinner in the neighborhood

215
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,280
Oh my god, you guys made it just in time because my game is literally finished right now

216
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,120
We didn't even have to do anything the killer didn't hurt us all this round. I don't know why

217
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
It was a friendly killer. I saw that

218
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,040
That was funny. Well when I was miss missy, can you ask him if he knows about being you?

219
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,800
I will not

220
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,520
Oh, I'll do it in chat. I'll be the one to ask. I'll bet. Do you know what? Wait, zele, you would do it

221
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Zele, you would do it

222
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,040
I love you, zele and strane said they would do it

223
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Okay

224
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,920
Does he want any

225
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Like he does he not want any point? I feel like he's one of us

226
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,800
There's no way that the first game we get playing a multiplayer

227
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,840
Can a game and he's nice. Okay. I'm gonna leave because we're about to get stabbed by the the entity but I left already

228
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,440
Okay, I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'll early set up the next game

229
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
But I don't like do I want to be the killer? I don't

230
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I'll try

231
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,320
No, it's up to you. I could always be the hunter since no one's interested in killing great

232
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,560
Thank you for being so nice excavation mark

233
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,800

234
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,840
I don't know if you were a stream sniper though

235
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
We actually

236
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,880
Wait, is he writing in the chat? I'm asking if I don't know if he can talk

237
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Oh

238
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:28,240
Oh, he's it's a global. I think he's on console. So we can't talk back. We're we'll never know

239
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,400
I don't be a mystery. Oh, by the way, what is your what? What is your accent? I really like it. It's so cute. I'm scottish

240
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,360
So if you don't scottish, oh my god, I love scottish accents

241
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,640
If you don't understand me, please do not be afraid to ask me to repeat myself because

242
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
No, no, no, I mean honestly

243
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,880
Like I think I mean I I can hear the scottish accent, but it's not super strong. It's not super strong

244
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
I mean, I can put it stronger

245
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
But I don't oh, okay

246
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,440

252
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,680
It usually takes a lot more dbd to like boot up for some weird reason. I don't know

253
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,040
In the meantime, can you tell me what your dream exactly was?

254
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,760

Something is happening leon. Hey somebody want to come on hook killing you guys. No miss ma. How did you see that?

376
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720

379
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
How am I not down?

380
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,640
Uh, yeah, I wonder who I don't know what perk that is. I have bought any knowledge

381
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,880
Urban evasion someone's doing that to me someone must have a perk that keeps me up because you've whacked me multiple times

382
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,920
That's why are you are you multiple this?

383
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,680
Yeah, lesion applies like when they're running they apply like deep wound

384
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,480
So it's like that thing where you have to like amend yourself, but you're not like

385
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,000
I'm learning because I was like, uh, how am I getting further away from you?

386
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,000
I should be knocked down. I feel like this is cheating if i'm not getting knocked after the second hit

387
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
Don't worry leons. I've got this

Oh my god, you're body blocking. I'm body blocking. I need to get the fucking

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,160
I don't think I can

435
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,520
Run, guy, guys

436

437
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,200
Oh no, oh no

438
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,640
I'll take you at least

439
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,040
Oh no

440
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,400
You're killing your guy

441
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,360
You're trying, you're trying, you're trying

442
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Running your fools, running your fools

443
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Wait the hatch. Did you make it?

444
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
Get the hatch, get the hatch, get the hatch

445
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
No way the hatch spawned right there

446
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
I don't know where that is.

447
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,040
It was all talked to the hell.

448
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,880
What can you speak to?

449
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,960
Yeah, it spawned right in front of the exit,

450
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,000
which was weird.

451
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,120
Give him ogre.

452
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,620
Ta-da!

453
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,360
That was really sweet.

454
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,600
Oh, no, Msma, you forgot to put Perkz on.

455
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
Oh, no.

456
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,040
Oh, oh, for Msma.

457
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,600
Oopsies.

458
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,280
Did you not have Perkz on that entire?

459
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,760
Well, we so cheated.

460
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,160
Sorry, you didn't have one Perkz to use against us.

461
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,400
Oh, really?

462
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,320
It's really like Msma's is empty if you tap to the next thing.

463
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,720
No, I feel like you could have easily killed us if you have,

464
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,560
like, there's something called Insta-kill or something.

465
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,080
I don't know.

466
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,560
No way.

467
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,720
I want to kill them every second.

468
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,640
I don't have any.

469
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,760
I play with zero Perkz.

470
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,240
Oh, you just that NLG, clearly.

471
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,600
Should we switch between killers and survivors?

472
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,440
Yes, please.

473
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,360
Yeah.

474
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,840
Oopsie.

475
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,440
Who wants to be a killer?

476
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,520
Zellie wants to become a killer.

477
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,040
Not me.

478
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,640
Why?

479
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,280
I don't want to be a killer.

480
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,560
I can be huntress if you guys don't want to kill each other.

481
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,080
I love huntress.

482
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,880
She's so pretty.

483
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,760
How do I do that?

484
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,480
Do you have to host it?

485
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,160
I think I have to host it myself.

486
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,640
No.

487
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,280
All you have to do, actually, you can switch.

488
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,640
There's like on the, OK, well, everybody left anyway.

489
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
Oh, well, don't play game.

490
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,600
Hold on.

491
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
No, it's OK.

492
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,520
On the side menu, there's like, it's like kind of like near the bottom.

493
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,640
There's like a little eyeball.

494
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,760
Swapy thing?

495
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,880
There's like a little icon that you can keep clicking to like swap

496
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,600
between killer, spectator, and survivor.

497
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, we need to hurry it up because like the killer on my menu

498
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,680
is like groaning, and I don't want to hear it.

499
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,200
OK.

500
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,760
Wait, can you?

501
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,800
Wait, can you?

502
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,720
I don't mean to do that, sorry.

503
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,760
Oh, God, I don't know what any of the perks for the killers are gold.

504
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,400
Wait, am I in?

505
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,880
I did you get that invite, Mismar?

506
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,320
No, can I get an invite?

507
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh, I got to add you on steam.

508
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,840
Wait, wait, if Mismar actually gets from there.

509
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,320
Yeah.

510
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,000
OK.

511
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,800
Oh, can you?

512
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,040
Right.

513
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,280
Don't judge my addition for the refunds.

514
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,560
I can see the POV of what I'm putting on right now.

515
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,080
OK.

516
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,600
Stop.

517
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,680
I'm here.

518
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,880
I'm putting on as well.

519
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,720
I'm here to win.

520
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm not here to lose.

521
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,840
Oh, my God, it's Ada.

522
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,000
Hi, Ada.

523
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,680
I'm literally in love with you, Ada.

524
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,840
Hi, Ada.

525
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,480
My name is Leon.

526
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,360
Hi, Leon.

527
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,240
My name is Leon.

528
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,440
My name is also Leon.

529
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,160
No, my name is Leon.

530
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,400
No, my name is Leon.

531
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,560
You even know what the S means in Leon S Kennedy?

532
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,280
Sigma.

533
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,800
No, it means sky in Indian.

534
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,040
It means sigma.

535
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,800
Which map do you all want?

536
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
I don't want to go to school.

537
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,120
You want to go to school?

538
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,600
My wish is later.

539
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,160
You know what?

540
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,120
I hate the school, but sure, we can do it.

541
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,400
I want to go to school.

542
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,880
The girls pick my first.

543
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
You guys are not ready for what I'm putting on.

544
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,800
So it's like midwidge elementary school, right?

545
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,520
Yeah.

546
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm going to come back to school.

547
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,520
That's awesome.

548
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,160
Awesome.

549
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,040
I don't know.

550
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,240
Awesome.

551
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,920
I don't know.

552
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,520
Are we focused?

553
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,440
Do you have any suggestions on what other two perks

554
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,680
I should put on because I don't remember anything?

555
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,480
OK.

556
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,160
Remember what?

557
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,560
I don't remember any.

558
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
OK, I'm just I'm just throwing stuff on.

559
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,520
OK, if you guys are ready, I'm ready it up.

560
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,080
If you're ready, I'm ready because I don't remember anything.

561
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,520
I only play only practice on Survivor yesterday on my own.

562
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,200
And I was like, OK, OK, I think I can

563
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,680
survive when I play with this one, the gang.

564
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,080
I was like, yeah, yeah, no, I'm not

565
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,120
going to be like a dead anchor.

566
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,400
Wait, should I remove all my perks?

567
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,600
Oh, wait, no, we're playing with perks.

568
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,800
No, no, everyone put your perks on.

569
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,680
I just had a brain fart.

570
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,800
I just had a brain fart.

571
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,440
Sorry.

572
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,360
Because I was like, oh, this wasn't happening with perks.

573
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,840
That's just because I'm stupid, they can't.

574
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,400
Me too, twinsies.

575
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,360
Oh my god.

576
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,640
Yes, sleigh.

577
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,240
Don't start.

578
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,880
Don't start working.

579
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,560
You've been playing too much dress, so we'll blow up.

580
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,000
Dress through a press.

581
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,800
You've been playing dress and press?

582
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,160
I've seen it everywhere.

583
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,880
Is it fun?

584
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,520
Yeah, I saw you're playing it a little bit.

585
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,600
Because I was like, because it's like so popular.

586
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,800
So I was like, OK, whatever.

587
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,960
I guess I will give it another try.

588
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,640
And then I just end up like disappointed.

589
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,680
And I'm like, OK, the shit's kind of ass, whatever.

590
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,600
But you're still playing it.

591
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,520
You got upset because I wouldn't play with you.

592
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,640
Well, no, it's because I had a stream.

593
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,800
So I was like, oh, maybe I can just invite you

594
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,440
to play dress through and press.

595
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,360
I'm having my second day dolothon, do you get you?

596
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,960
Yeah, but I was like, maybe you can just play

597
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,960
a dress through and press on stream with me

598
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,880
on your dolothon for a little bit.

599
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,920
I had a plan, I'm so sorry.

600
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,680
It's OK, I literally played it with me.

601
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,400
We ate.

602
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,320
We ate.

603
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,560
We ate that wall away and slayed.

604
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,320
Oh my god, stop.

605
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,360
As the kids say.

606
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,720
This is in the school.

607
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,080
Oh, somebody else picked the YAMOKA residence.

608
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,280
So I'm putting the button in my mouth.

609
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,360
Wait, who picked the YAMOKA residence?

610
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,400
It isn't guaranteed when you do an offering.

611
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,320
Yeah, but I saw that somebody picked

612
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,840
YAMOKA residence, right?

613
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,400
Hey, what is it?

614
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,680
What is the Nicholas Cage drama?

615
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,920
Perk, do I go?

616
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,160
I think that's the one that.

617
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,080
I do not play as Nicholas Cage.

618
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I see you.

619
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,360
OK, maybe I should have chased there.

620
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:43,000
I may have made a oopsie-woopsie, OK?

621
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,920
Oh, surprise.

622
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,760
No killing you guys.

623
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,680
Sorry, I fell off.

624
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,560
You fell off.

625
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,600
You didn't fall off.

626
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,520
You mean I was the best one?

627
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,000
And come in.

628
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,960
I see you breaking the gen.

629
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,040
Have you ever had haggis?

630
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,760
I'm sorry.

631
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,560
I have.

632
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,440
It's been this whole time.

633
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,240
Leon.

634
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,480
Have you ever had haggis?

635
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,280
Yes, I have.

636
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,320
It's actually not that bad, but I

637
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
don't know if you want to know what it's made of.

638
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,520
Or you'd rather know.

639
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,160
It's like made of like sheep.

640
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,000
Sheep lungs and intestines.

641
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,240
Yeah, it's kind of scary.

642
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,000
You don't think you can get away from me.

643
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,480
Leon, Leon, I'm hooked, Leon.

644
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,280
Oh, no.

645
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,040
Right, that's cheating.

646
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,920
Sorry, that's cheating.

647
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,720
I'm not going for you because you just got off the hook.

648
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,520
That's not fair.

649
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,200
That's not fair.

650
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,160
That's cheating, Dylan.

651
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,440
That's called tunneling.

652
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,040
For those of you who don't play dead by delay,

653
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,080
they remove someone from the hook.

654
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:50,840
I'm not doing anything, bro.

655
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,920
I'm coming.

656
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,640
Oh, she fucking snagged me, bro.

657
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,440
I'm leaving you.

658
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Sorry.

659
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,320
Don't be scared.

660
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,320
I'm coming.

661
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,720
Oh, we're chasing Mesma.

662
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,320
Should we chase the birthday girl?

663
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
That's so painful.

664
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
Shoot me, really.

665
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Shoot me, shoot me.

666
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
What happened to it?

667
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,320
What happened to your happy birthday?

668
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
Someone's moaning.

669
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
I heard you because you were moaning.

670
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,320
I don't feel so good.

671
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
I don't know.

672
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,320
It's always Leon, too.

673
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
You don't move.

674
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,320
How did you do it?

675
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,320
I really don't want to bone anymore.

676
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Thank you.

677
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Come here.

678
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Oh, my god.

679
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
This is a fucking mess.

680
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,320
I'm going to run.

681
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
I'm going to run.

682
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,320
I'm going to run.

683
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
I'm going to run.

684
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,320
I'm going to run.

685
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
I'm going to run.

686
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
I don't know anything I'm talking about.

687
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
Just accept it.

688
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
You're going to the void into the...

689
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Is it the rift they call it?

690
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
I can't remember what they call it.

691
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
I'm coming for you.

692
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Oh, hey.

693
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Oh, someone ran over here.

694
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Naughty, naughty.

695
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
When you run, I can see your footsteps.

696
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
No, you can't.

697
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
Boom.

698
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
You got a good aim.

699
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
No, really.

700
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
It's just really lucky.

701
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Oh, there's another kid.

702
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Okay.

703
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
Did I just see another cute girl

704
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
around this corner?

705
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
Did I just see another cute girl?

706
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,320
No, I didn't.

707
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Okay.

708
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
You probably saw Leon Kennedy.

709
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Which one?

710
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,320
I need to move.

711
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,320
Wait, I'm only alive one catcher.

712
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Can we...

713
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Can we...

714
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,320
Can we all play as Leon as Kennedy?

715
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
I think they'll be fucking hilarious.

716
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Okay, I'm not going for you

717
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
because you just go off the hook.

718
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
So who just took you off the hook?

719
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
Where are they?

720
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
Come here.

721
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,320
Where are you?

722
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,320
Are you hiding in the lockers?

723
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Oh, I see Leon.

724
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
No?

725
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,320
Yes.

726
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Damn it.

727
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Who's popping?

728
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Are you just popping his fire away?

729
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,320
Where are you?

730
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Are you hiding in here in the bamboo?

731
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
Get out of the bamboo.

732
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,320
I can hear Misma moaning,

733
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
but I'm not tunneling Misma.

734
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
That's not nice.

735
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Who is popping the gents?

736
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,320
I can literally see what you're doing on the map all the time.

737
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
I'm coming.

738
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

739
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320
I grabbed you.

740
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Is that your second took?

741
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,320
Is this your second took?

742
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Bro, I was like,

743
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
literally watching her dude.

744
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I was like,

745
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,320
oh, well, I had stayed here.

746
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
Goodbye.

747
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Is that your second took, Misma?

748
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
Yeah.

749
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Okay, right.

750
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,320
I'll leave you.

751
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
I'm sorry.

752
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
It's just that the hunters makes my...

753
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
It makes me a little bit...

754
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
Yeah, exactly.

755
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
Thank you.

756
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,320
There isn't injured Leon around here,

757
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,320
so I'm trying to listen out for some moans.

758
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,320
I smell Leon.

759
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Leon.

760
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Leon.

761
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,320
Leon.

762
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,320
Leon.

763
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,320
Leon.

764
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,320
I need to help Leon.

765
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
Leon, I don't know where you are, Leon.

766
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
I'm at...

767
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Hey, don't want me.

768
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
You're looking.

769
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
You're throwing it back.

770
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,320
Yeah, sure.

771
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,320
I'm literally down.

772
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
I'm so sorry.

773
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,320
I'm so sorry.

774
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
I wasn't even looking.

775
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
I thought you were going to come

776
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
for the complete opposite direction,

777
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
so I was like,

778
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
oh, I wonder where she is.

779
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
I was the president.

780
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Where are you, Leon?

781
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Here, here.

782
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
How are you?

783
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
How are you?

784
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
You're behind here.

785
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
I know one of you is here.

786
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
I don't know if it's Leon Twins,

787
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
but one of you is here.

788
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
I know you're here.

789
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,320
I'm going to walk away.

790
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,320
I'm going to walk away.

791
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
Someone's been working on this.

792
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,320
Your hips are so nice, Ada.

793
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,320
Don't talk to my wife like that.

794
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
She's my wife.

795
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,320
She's my wife.

796
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
Fill me up.

797
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
She's my wife.

798
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
I smell you.

799
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Leon, touch me.

800
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,320
I see you.

801
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
I'm coming.

802
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,320
I'm touching you, Ada.

803
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,320
Yes.

804
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,320
Do you think a pallet is enough to stop me?

805
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,320
I am so cute.

806
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,320
You're even cuter when you're on the hook.

807
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
No, I don't want to.

808
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
I don't want to be on the hook.

809
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,320
You don't want to be a hooker?

810
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,320
No, I don't want to be on the hook.

811
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,320
I don't want to be a hooker.

812
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
They got a shit ton of money.

813
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
True or real?

814
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,320
You'll never get enough.

815
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Please, ma'am.

816
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Can I just have one generator?

817
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,320
Oh, shit.

818
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,320
Yeah, what the fuck?

819
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,320
I think we deserve one generator as a treat.

820
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
You want to save Leon?

821
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,320
I won't make it in time.

822
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,320
I won't make it in time.

823
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,320
You're far away, you say?

824
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,320
Leon, you don't understand.

825
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
I'm very far away from you.

826
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,320
If you're far away, you must be over at this little generator here.

827
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,320
No, I'm really close, actually.

828
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,320
Are you close?

829
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
I'll make you close, all right.

830
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,320
Come here, Leon.

831
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
It's over.

832
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,320
You really think pallet stunning works with me?

833
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
This is scary.

834
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,320
It's over.

835
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
You know what?

836
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,320
What the fuck she did?

837
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,320
She made it through the window.

838
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,320
I can't hit past the window.

839
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
The killers can't hit past the window.

840
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
I swear, you have a really good aim.

841
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,320
Don't struggle.

842
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
I'm fucking dead.

843
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,320
Don't smell me, Zellie.

844
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,320
I got a birthday sweat.

845
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
Who just broke my totem?

846
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Did someone just break my totem?

847
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
Leon, why did you do that?

848
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,320
Anger.

849
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Not me.

850
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
I didn't do it in the bay.

851
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,320
I didn't do it in the bay.

852
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,320
I didn't do it in the bay.

853
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,320
I didn't do it in the bay.

854
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Angers.

855
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,320
I got stunned.

856
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
I just got stunned.

857
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
I'm coming for you.

858
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Leon, I mean danger, Leon.

859
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Why do you sound like...

860
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
What, man?

861
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,320
Leon, I mean danger, Leon.

862
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
Where did you go?

863
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,320
I literally...

864
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,320
Where is everyone going playing bingo?

865
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,320
I'm here to tell you, ma'am.

866
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm not into this.

867
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
I didn't even know where you went.

868
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,320
I wasn't...

869
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
I don't know what just happened.

870
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,320
Leon, I love it when you touch my body.

871
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,320
I mean, I love it when you touch my body, too, Ada.

872
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
You hate me.

873
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,320
Who's been doing this, January?

874
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
Who's been doing this, January?

875
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,320
One of you are here.

876
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
I smell you.

877
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
Yes, I can tell.

878
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,320
I'm using my ancestors' hunting techniques.

879
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320
I know one of you are here.

880
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
Are you in the slugger?

881
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,320
No.

882
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
Okay.

883
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,320
I'm gonna let you go.

884
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:35,320
As a courtesy, as an offering to the entity itself,

885
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,320
I'll give you a chance, but not for long.

886
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,320
I'm so bricked up right now.

887
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
Oh!

888
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
What was that soundboard?

889
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
What was that soundboard?

890
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,320
I don't know.

891
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,320
Oh, my God.

892
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,320
I was gonna die, anyway.

893
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,320
I think you're all on your last took, unfortunately,

894
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,320
as much as I like to be a cheeky stall.

895
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,320
Oh, wait, hold on.

896
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,320
You should put me down.

897
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
Oh, you want me to put you down?

898
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
I'll put you down.

899
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
No, she's gonna kill me.

900
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,320
I'll put you down if you want it.

901
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,320
I can't believe this bro.

902
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,320
Why would you do this to me?

903
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,320
You asked for it.

904
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,320
Oh, miss, mom!

905
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,320
You're asking for it, too.

906
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,320
Oh, wait.

907
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,320
Oh, no, you're not on phase two, so I can't...

908
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,320
You're not on phase two, so I can't finish them for you.

909
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,320
Wait, why?

910
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
No, you're...

911
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,320
Yeah, you're struggling now.

912
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,320
Okay, that makes sense.

913
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,320
I'm coming.

914
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,320
I'm not good with skill checks, guys.

915
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
That's why I keep bombing the generator.

916
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,320
Where are you?

917
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Missy, you don't have Nicholas Cage?

918
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
I'm being touched.

919
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,320
Why don't you have Nicholas Cage?

920
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Are you both like Missy?

921
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Missy, imagine the fucking biggest collab ever.

922
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,320
Leon as Kennedy and then Nicholas Cage.

923
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Yeah, I was stinky, man.

924
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
You know exactly what was about to happen.

925
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Don't start with me.

926
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,320
That's called tunneling.

927
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,320
I'm sure...

928
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
None of you just hate in lockers.

929
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,320
You guys are scared of what happens in the locker.

930
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,320
Okay, there was someone here.

931
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,320
Freakin' awesome.

932
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,320
You in the red dress, reveal yourself.

933
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,320
Even this locker?

934
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,320
Imagine if you were, though.

935
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,320
And I was about to walk away.

936
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,320
That would actually be really funny.

937
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,320
Okay.

938
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,320
You were here.

939
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,320
Don't think I didn't know your presence was around these parts.

940
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,320
But unfortunately, I can't find you, so...

941
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
I'm gonna go huntin' again.

942
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,320
What the hell?

943
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,320
I see Msma.

944
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,320
No, you don't.

945
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,320
Well...

946
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,320
I really don't want to tunnel you, but Msma,

947
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,320
I'll only keep fainting you.

948
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,320
I don't want to...

949
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,320
I don't want to ruin the vase for the birthday.

950
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,320
I'm giving preferential treatment before anyone says...

951
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,320
It's her birthday!

952
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,320
Who screamed?

953
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,320
Who's screaming?

954
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,320
Why are you...

955
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Was that in-game or was that one of you?

956
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
Am I gone crazy?

957
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
Could've been me.

958
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,320
Sus.

959
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
This is sus.

960
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,320
What?

961
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,320
It's anything.

962
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
What's the...

963
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
How do you think it belongs to that?

964
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,320
Okay.

965
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,320
Killer time.

966
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,320
Ooh, are you working on this generator right here?

967
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Oh my goodness!

968
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Okay.

969
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,320
Are you working on this one, huh?

970
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,320
Do you think you have my permission to work on the generator?

971
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,320
Do not escape me.

972
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,320
I'm sorry, but you're dead as well.

973
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,320
A bluster?

974
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,320
A bluster!

975
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,320
Oh, we walked into each other!

976
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,320
Oh no!

977
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,320
Wait, where are you?

978
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,320
Oh, okay.

979
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,320
Happy birthday, Msma!

980
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,320
We love you!

981
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,320
Happy birthday to an axe to the face!

982
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
This is just what I wanted.

983
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,320
It's okay.

984
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,320
I want you to smile to me.

985
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,320
Happy birthday!

986
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,320
Okay.

987
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Yeah, you can...

988
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
Expect it.

989
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Yes, you'll be able to...

990
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Expect what you're doing.

991
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,320
Pop that one.

992
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
Oh dear.

993
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,320
Somebody should play as the K-pop killer.

994
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
I think that would be funny.

995
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
Oh my god.

996
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
What was that?

997
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
He's my oppa.

998
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
Stop.

999
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Damn!

1000
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Um...

1001
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
Is that a hangover?

1002
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
Oppa.

1003
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,320
He's ghosted.

1004
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,320
It's not funny.

1005
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
It's on sale.

1006
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,320
It's a killer that looks to the three same generators.

1007
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,320
But, um...

1008
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
Unfortunately, you guys are...

1009
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,320
We've been unlucky and the last three gins are right next to each other.

1010
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,320
So I know we use her around here.

1011
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Oh, I see you!

1012
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,320
Leon!

1013
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,320
I see you!

1014
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,320
I have you.

1015
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Who are you flashing?

1016
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
Who did you...

1017
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,320
Did you flash me?

1018
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,320
Did you just flash me?

1019
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Don't wait.

1020
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,320
Do you have a perk where you don't have to make a skill check?

1021
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,320
Why are you going in the basement?

1022
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,320
No, I'm just getting really lucky.

1023
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,320
Are you silly?

1024
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,320
Where are you?

1025
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,320
You're silly so good.

1026
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,320
Don't go in the basement.

1027
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,320
The basement is mine.

1028
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,320
No.

1029
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,320
Zellie's gonna die.

1030
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,320
Zellie's gonna die.

1031
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Just go find a basement.

1032
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,320
I'm dying.

1033
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
I'm gonna hide.

1034
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
Two moments.

1035
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,320
Two moments.

1036
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,320
I'm just...

1037
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,320
I'm coming for you.

1038
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,320
She's going to catch you.

1039
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,320
No, no.

1040
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,320
She got this.

1041
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,320
I'm looking for her.

1042
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,320
I'm looking for her.

1043
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,320
Bro, I think it would be really funny if she just closes the attic.

1044
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,320
You may get the hatch.

1045
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,320
I don't know where you are.

1046
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,320
Oh, not the attic.

1047
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
I mean the hatch.

1048
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,320
I mean the hatch.

1049
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,320
I never say that.

1050
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,320
Okay.

1051
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,320
Time to kill you.

1052
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,320
Cause I found the hatch first.

1053
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,320
I'm coming for you.

1054
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,320
Don't be scared.

1055
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320
Come on.

1056
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,320
You wanna let me win, don't you?

1057
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,320
I'm not...

1058
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,320
I'm not scared.

1059
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,320
No, I'm not scared.

1060
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,320
Are you pulling that door?

1061
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
Oh, don't do that.

1062
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

1063
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,320
I'll let you guys have your moment.

1064
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,320
That's the wrong gate.

1065
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,320
I assure you.

1066
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,320
You're going the wrong way.

1067
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,320
You hear my heart beat.

1068
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,320
Yes.

1069
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,320
My gosh.

1070
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,320
I can't find it.

1071
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,320
What are you doing?

1072
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
Don't touch that.

1073
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,320
I didn't give you permission to touch that.

1074
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,320
I'm teasing her.

1075
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:13,320
I'm f**king teasing her.

1076
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,320
I'm edging her.

1077
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,320
I'm edging her.

1078
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,320
Okay.

1079
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,320
I'll let you go.

1080
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,320
I'll let you go.

1081
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,320
I messed up.

1082
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,320
I'll let you go.

1083
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,320
I messed up my aim.

1084
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,320
Hold on.

1085
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,320
Let me reload.

1086
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,320
You better hurry up before I reload.

1087
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,320
You better hurry.

1088
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,320
You're so dead.

1089
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
You better hurry.

1090
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,320
I'm not going to do it while you're pooling it.

1091
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,320
Okay.

1092
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,320
On the way out.

1093
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,320
There you go.

1094
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,320
Thank you.

1095
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
Well played.

1096
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,320
Well played, everyone.

1097
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
That was fantastic.

1098
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,320
You did amazing.

1099
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,320
That was scary.

1100
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,320
I won't be the killer again.

1101
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,320
I'll let you guys play the game.

1102
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,320
I was going to say,

1103
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,320
if I got my times right,

1104
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,320
I have to go into the mix.

1105
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,320
No, that's fine.

1106
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,320
That worked out perfectly.

1107
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
Thank you so much for letting me be the killer

1108
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,320
and having me,

1109
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,320
and it was so nice to say hello and meet you all

1110
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
for the first time.

1111
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,320
Thank you so much.

1112
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,320
Thank you.

1113
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,320
Have an amazing time.

1114
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,320
Thank you.

1115
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Bye.

1116
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
Bye.

1117
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,320
Bye.

1118

Bye.

1119
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
Bye.

1120
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,320
Bye.

1121
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
Bye.

1122
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,320
Bye.

1123
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,320
Bye.

1124
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,320
Bye.

1125
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Bye.

1126
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,320
Bye.

1127
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,320
Bye.

1128
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,320
Bye.

1129
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
Bye.

1130
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,320
Bye.

1131
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320

Bye.

1134
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Yeah, absolutely over.

1135
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,320
I was having far too much fun killing them.

1136
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,320
I'm sorry about that.

1137
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,320
You like all my assets?

1138
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,320
This is how excited for the stream I was.

1139
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,320
Look, I'm all covered in blood.

1140
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,840
I put blood tears on me.

1141
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,320
I put blood over my chest.

1142
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,320
I had my little hatchet.

1143
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,320
I knew I was going to be playing the Hunter.

1144
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
I knew.

1145
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,320
I knew I was playing the Hunters.

1146
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,320
Love your outfit.

1147
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,320
Yeah, I'm gonna try and do this a bit more for streams. That was so lovely

1148
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,200
Enjoyed that so much. You did amazing. I was having too much fun killing them

1149
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,880
Is that what you said about the last family munkah? Was that scary in here?

1150
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Mmm

1151
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,120
That was so good

1152
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:26,200
Strony Yandere Hunter's RP. I hope I didn't kill the vibe so like too much because I was like actually sweating trying to win the game

1153
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,200
I'm such a wee try hard

1154
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:34,360
Um, but yes, uh, that was a fantastic club with the VNU girls. Oh my god

1155
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:38,520
That's the first time I've like actually interacted with someone stream. I hope I didn't say anything to inappropriate

1156
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:45,400
Are we gonna get more strony dead by daylight? Well speaking of dead by daylight clubs

1157
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,800
My sin sister and I may or may not

1158
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:57,080
Be hunting both the imps and the reeflings down at a later date. So no don't quit the game

1159
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,680
There's currently a game mode called 2v8. Um, so

1160
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,560
We're gonna hunt you guys down together

1161
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,600
in stream

1162
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,720
I believe one of them said I'm so break up right now. I'm looking forward to

1163
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:20,120
Yeah, it goes away in four days. Yes. So sin and I are gonna do a collab very shortly very shortly because the game mode's gonna go away

1164
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,680
um, I

1165
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:29,560
Am you guys better be scared of strony after that performance. She's gonna carry me. Wait. Was that scary? Wait. Was that actually scary?

1166
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,960
I was just having a lot of fun killing them

1167
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,160
I think um

1168
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,400
D gave that she was brave though

1169
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,480
We can do custom matches

1170
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,080
You want to do them right now? Can I do matches to get you guys in?

1171
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,480
Maybe this maybe we'll pause fortnight another time and we could do dead by daylight if you want me to hunt you down

1172
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,440
I wish I wasn't working right now

1173
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,400
So how do I how would I get you guys in right now?

1174
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,840
Play as

1175
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,840
A custom game. Can I give a code?

1176
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,200
I wasn't scary as the blood tears go down her cheek

1177
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:12,680
Hold on. Let me let me put myself back in position. Maybe this will be the stream snipe for today and we'll play fortnight

1178
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,640
Uh and an axe in her hand

1179
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,360
Huh

1180
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,080
We would have to add you

1181
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,600
Can you do it without having friends?

1182
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,240
I don't think so

1183
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,240
match management

1184
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,320
Yeah

1185
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,160
Store shrines switch to survivor loadout character

1186
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:42,200
Like split off of money. All right. You have to add a pagora. Oh wait. I didn't know we would have to add

1187
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,400
I don't know sin. Are you streaming right now?

1188
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,200
Do you just want to do two killers and get worked?

1189
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,760
Or do you not have time right now?

1190
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:56,600
Impromptu sin and the strongy collab on top of the other mysterious collab

1191
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,960
Um, but I will update the description and the title of the stream afterwards just to say that who I collabed with because we

1192
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,040
It didn't there was actually a few people like things got swapped around and I didn't want to like make a thumbnail in case they weren't in it

1193
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,080
type thing

1194
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,360
Uh, yeah, you have to use it in game friends list. Okay, right. No

1195
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,360
Okay, if we if I can't just get in a game without adding you guys

1196
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:25,320
What I'll do is I'm gonna make a throwaway dead by daylight steam account

1197
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,200
like for that stuff

1198
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Cause I don't want people being like, oh

1199
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,760
You know what I mean? Okay

1200
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,480
A lot of good clips in the collab too. Wait, actually

1201
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,000
I felt like I was being so boring. I'm like, oh

1202
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:45,640
I'm glad they were having fun. No. Um, I hope I didn't bring it down or anything. I don't know if I can I really suck at freaking co-op

1203
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,880
Anyway, mommy doesn't want to be friends with eyes

1204
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:54,440
No, I don't want people being like, uh strongy had me as a friend, but didn't add me

1205
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,680
Right what I'm going to suggest then my little

1206
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,840
reeflings

1207
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,800
Um, I am going to go offline for one

1208
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:09,000
Hour and then we'll boot up boot it up mommy. Oh wait, hold on. Let me put a little love heart

1209
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,560
Thank you so much for

1210
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:14,040
that collab

1211
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,680
That was so fun. Sorry if I got

1212
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,480
scary

1213
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:26,680
All the reeflings are saying I was terrifying. Oopsies. I just really like hunting things

1214
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,200
And then I'll put loads of green hearts because that was very kind of mesmer to invite me

1215
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,560
But yeah, one hour is chess going to be on. No, chess is I'm not doing chess

1216
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:45,720
To today. Chester chess is today. When's the fortnight fennel pen?

1217

Or I tell you what

1218
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,640
I could actually just redirect into the fortnight and if you give me literally five minutes

1219

1228
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:36,520
But you have to give me five minutes because the kettle takes three minutes to boil

1229
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,880
And then I'll pour the tea the boiling water into the cup

1230
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,920
With a little bit of honey

1231
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,600

Don't forget to add the reefling ink too. Um, I am going to redirect into my fortnight stream

1233
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:05,320
