1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Oh no, God.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
eating the microphone to my mouth hole

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
mumahinha

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,500

good morning good evening good afternoon

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
can you hear these beats in the background

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
that's from the video game that we're about to play

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
thank you Jacob

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
and dot gar for becoming a member as well

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
my good morning good evening good afternoon

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
did you see Mercy's new role play

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
did you listen to me cut my hair in it for her

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,500
yeah cut my hair from the Mercy role play that's right

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
that's right I sacrificed my little hair strands

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
in the name of doing hair cutting ASMR

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I was actually here cutting

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
it was a certified classic Mercy role play

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
it was a fantastic role play

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
um look I might be a little bit biased

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
on the Mercy role play okay

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
I may or may not have been the one who wrote it

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
I am a little bit biased okay

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
listen to it when I fell asleep in someone

33
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
oh you enjoyed it I'm glad

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
someone was bald now no I cut my fringe like my bangs

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
but it was overgrown

36
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
like horrifically overgrown

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
it kind of worked out in the end

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
your bangs your precious bangs my cabbages

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm a loby belly bald

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
she loves her thank you Jacob

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500
oh there's no way I'm going to say that right

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
thanks for the extended membership

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
right updates

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
my updates are

45
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
um

46
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
I can't stream too long for today

47
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,500
however I have fantastic reasoning as to why

48
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
the veiler video game

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
finishing touches are occurring today

50
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,500
so I don't know how long this game is going to last

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
but turnip boy took like 3 hours

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,500
turnip boy tax evasion was 3 hours

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
um

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,500
make me choose between you and Mercy to be my veiler

55
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
oh she'll make it Mercy

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Mercy tries very hard

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
I am not a jealous streamer

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
I just want you to be happy

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I want you to enjoy who you enjoy

60
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
no stress no this no that okay

61
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
it's about 5 hours oh shhh

62
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
shhh

63
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
um right

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
hmm

65
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
it's about 5 hours to play

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
did you end up re-recording your part of the game

67
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
no so what's happening is

68
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I am shipping off everyone else's sections

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
and then I am having to redo my lines

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
because I need to completely redo my section

71
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,500
my last scene thankfully the rest of my lines are fine

72
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
my only worry is that it was so long ago

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
that it's going to be rather clear that I've recorded it

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
at two different times but it is what it is

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,500
it was my first experience ever

76
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
dealing with video game type stuff

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
production wise so you know let me fuck up

78
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
thankfully none of the girls have any messed up sections

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
or anything wrong

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
but the finishing touches

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
it's all going to be packaged away today

82
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
and then we are waiting to see the fruits of our labour

83
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
will the game be on steam

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
no it will not be on steam it will be on itch.io

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
it will be free to play you don't have to pay any money

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
to access it or anything of that nature

87
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
the girls were most likely to play it on the blue site

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
although they'd be rather embarrassed when it comes to their section

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
but let them be embarrassed

90
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
but yes that is the

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
finishing touches are getting done today

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
which I can't avoid or stall any longer

93
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
because it's already been delayed so much

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
just due to issues with

95
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
you know I messed up in a few sections

96
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
areas of the game

97
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,500
embarrassment equals good

98
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
so if you

99
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
we're not here there is a game called turnip boy

100
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,500
commits tax evasion

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,500
and it was a hoot and a holler I loved it I adored it

102
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I didn't know what to expect so I said

103
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
alright we're going to play the sequel

104
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
so this does kanone kalei

105
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
it does come

106
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
off a

107
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
after what events have happened

108
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
it says rob's a bank I don't know what to expect

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I didn't look off anything so we're going to find out

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
you see that turnip with a pistol he's literally me

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,500
it's so good that you can see the dead boss

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,500
from the previous game

113
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,500
kanone kalei

114
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
breaking news release of indy title causes 22,700

115
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
reflinks to dissolve in the dust after inking too much

116
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I messed it up

117
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,500
it was supposed to be banal but it's hot dog

118
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
and unfortunately it is what it is

119
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
I mean I think it's still hot either way

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
turnip boy how do you

121
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
I'm going to give you a badminton for that

122
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
yeah ok there you go

123
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,500
well it doesn't feel bad

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
as I said it was the first time

125
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I learned to do something like that

126
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
and you know with the success of vlo

127
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
it's not like it's a one and done

128
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
and we'll never try and pursue something of that nature ever again

129
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
so don't write us off just yet

130
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
don't write us off just yet

131
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
don't be like oh that was really disappointing bro it's the first time I've ever done something

132
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
give me some skin

133
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
give me some of that goodness

134
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
do you know when the game is going to get released

135
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
no so the final touches are being everything

136
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
is being packaged off today so the ball

137
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
is no longer in my core after today

138
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,500
that is why I don't have too much time to

139
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
cut about today on stream

140
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
and I hope that that's ok

141
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
I do have fantastic news

142
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
for the girls

143
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
their next emote batch is beginning

144
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
AC is first up on the commission

145
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
for her emote batches

146
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
if I recall correctly

147
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
it's between 7 and 10 emotes but everyone's going to get new emote batches soon

148
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
how much sleep did you get

149
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I actually did alright

150
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I woke up an hour early before stream

151
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,500
to record the kissing audio that we wrote together

152
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,500
in a membership stream but my phone

153
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
my phone

154
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
was like 6% battery

155
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
and I was like I'm not risking recording this

156
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
and like running out of the script

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
how much is alright in hours

158
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
I think 7

159
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
I really wasn't that bad but

160
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500
you'll be flooded by Maros

161
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
wait with what

162
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,500
is it going to be a game with different routes

163
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
no so there's

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
one main thing you do

165
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,500
the replayability factor

166
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
is if you like that feeling of a completionist type

167
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
angle completely up to you

168
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
if you want to do that you don't have to do it

169
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
did you drink water today

170
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,500
but did you pray today

171
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
flooded by Maros I think

172
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
7 is good we'll take 7

173
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
yeah that was bad

174
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
one main thing you do

175
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
basically I demand uni

176
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I mean there will be different routes

177
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
if you didn't know Ozzy is flying for routes

178
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
means shagging

179
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
7 is better than 4

180
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
at least you aren't going back to no sleep

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
as I said there is now a third editor

182
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
in play I have good news for the reflins

183
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
we might have 3 audios

184
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
for the subscriber series

185
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
like one video per one case

186
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
there might be 3 audios

187
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
and more on the way

188
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
so as I said reflins were eating good

189
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
the girls have been doing fantastic

190
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500
they've been keeping up with their audios

191
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
we're just at this stage of where I want them to be

192
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
a month, 2 months in advance type thing

193
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Azura's donathon got finalised

194
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
she was a great sport

195
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
working through different problems

196
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
coming together to agreements

197
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
but I've got a bit of background work

198
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
to enable Azura to deliver

199
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
the donathon as fast as possible

200
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
because I am aware other agencies

201
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
have struggled with the delivery time

202
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
and it's completely understandable

203
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,500
because there's a lot of things that come together

204
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
but thankfully because Veilure

205
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
is so both equally hands off

206
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
and equally hands on if necessary

207
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
I can basically say do this, this, this, this

208
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
and then you've done all of this in advance

209
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
before it's not like she'll do the donathon

210
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
and then she's just completely on her own

211
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
she gets zero help, there's, you know

212
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
oh no, this is you, you agree to this

213
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
that's you, you made that money, you deal with it

214
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
no, it's not like that at all

215
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,500
it's like right here's a script, you do that

216
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
the team will edit it and upload it as soon

217
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
and then we can mark that off the list and move on to the next thing

218
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
what we're talking about, Azura's donathon

219
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm putting a lot of things

220
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
in place to very quickly

221
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
blast through her goals

222
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
so we're just doing a lot of things in advance

223
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
to enable her to prepare her

224
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
to do it

225
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
and you're all across it

226
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
did you see the sauna artwork?

227
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,500
I've been sitting on that artwork for months

228
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,500
for literal months

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,500
I have been sitting on that artwork

230
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,500
for literal months

231
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
I'm so glad it finally came to light

232
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
now I did say to the girls, I said to them

233
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
look, I've not ordered anything beyond this point

234
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
in terms of celebration artwork

235
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
there's a 5k celebration artwork

236
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,500
the sauna is the 10k celebration artwork

237
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
and those white hips

238
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
you can definitely see that Mercy's definitely got a bigger chest

239
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
than me naturally in that artwork

240
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I told the girls, I've not ordered any group stuff beyond that

241
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
but if you want me to

242
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I am more than happy to celebrate

243
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
the group artworks like that

244
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
because it's so cute

245
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I like all of us together

246
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,500
I thoroughly enjoy artwork

247
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
where we're all together

248
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
as I said I did order an artwork

249
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
personal artwork, which I'll share

250
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
but don't ruin the surprise

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
it's a secret

252
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
but I do have a wee doodly artwork

253
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
on the way of all six of us

254
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
hi, inking!

255
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I love the sauna artwork

256
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
them hips gonna make me go wild

257
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
it was very nice to commission that

258
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I thoroughly enjoyed putting everyone as the focus

259
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
and then I'm just kind of lurking in the background

260
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
I'm so unsure around the girls

261
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
which is probably the complete opposite

262
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm the pervert that runs around

263
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,500
because I was talking to Shibi in DMs

264
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
and I spoiler a message

265
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
and you know what I fucking said

266
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I'm gonna get in trouble for this

267
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
I went nice but by the way

268
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I'm like oh my god

269
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
I'm gonna get in trouble for this shit

270
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I can't be seeing this shit

271
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
what the fuck

272
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
you look adorable and nervous

273
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
very cute

274
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
a grip kissing artwork

275
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
give me a slumber party artwork

276
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
maybe for 15k

277
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
you get my daughters to 15k

278
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
slumber party artwork is yours

279
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
and that's that Strony Golem artwork

280
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
no worries you're the HR

281
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Strony's thoughts and the damn I'm flat

282
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
damn I'm hype

283
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
did you see my goth artwork as well

284
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
wink wink it's not our work

285
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I just messed around with my Vtube studio

286
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,500
and I made myself look like a god

287
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,500
does Vehler have a sexual harassment policy from boys

288
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
absolutely not

289
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
nope they have to

290
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
in the interview I specified that they have to

291
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
tolerate all sexual harassment from me

292
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
no I did not

293
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
no but we don't have a HR

294
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
or anything like that

295
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
that's not how it works around here

296
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
we ain't working like that

297
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
okay

298
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
because no one in the development team

299
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
has access to the girls and vice versa

300
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
the only people who can be harassed

301
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
is me

302
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
to them

303
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
I said what I said and I stand on it

304
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
not gonna lie goth Vehler looks like

305
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
well it's gone

306
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I was trying to read it but I couldn't make it

307
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
you just look really well in black goth stuff

308
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
goth Strony's lovely the goth doesn't fit you well

309
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I'm glad you don't think so

310
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I once snuck into a girls slumber party

311
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
it wasn't with her promise

312
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
goth mummy for genti

313
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
oh you just want me to pop up in genti as well

314
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
oh it's going

315
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I'm not Strony calls I'm goth McGee

316
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
alright you got me

317
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
you got me

318
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm convinced you don't say anything

319
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
okay I've got a cup of tea that's why I'm stalling

320
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
mummy I've got a tummy ache

321
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
oh no what did you eat

322
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
you eat something bad

323
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
every gen actually secretly

324
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
has a hidden Strony

325
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
real and true

326
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
well you're already all six Vehler girls

327
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
so why not another six

328
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
exactly

329
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
right it's AC snowfall time

330
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I'm watching Yu-Gi-Oh

331
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
oh wait that's not how AC sounds

332
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Ajii-san

333
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I'm watching Yu-Gi-Oh

334
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
wait how would she say it in her accent

335
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Privites

336
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I'm watching Yu-Gi-Oh

337
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Yu-Gi-Oh

338
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
no there's no way

339
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Strony goth being all of the gents

340
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
real and true

341
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I have canned french onion soup

342
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
I can't

343
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
did you heat it up right

344
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
normally canned food is fine

345
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
it's always the french

346
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
literally

347
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
hold on let me check if there's any marshmallows

348
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
cause I'm gonna drink

349
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I really wish she wouldn't do that

350
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I really really wish she wouldn't do that

351
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
that could have gone terribly wrong

352
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I'm not gonna lie

353
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
you could have seen links to stuff

354
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
if you didn't catch that

355
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
OBS started to capture what

356
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
was on my youtube

357
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
on my browsing thing

358
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
and it could have shown marshmallow links

359
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
to certain things

360
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
that aren't supposed to be shared

361
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
hi Strony

362
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
this is absolutely real and true

363
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,500
okay gospel truth

364
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
I now seem to have a mental block

365
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
where I can't ink to anything at all

366
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
I was laying in bed last night

367
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
my tentacle decided it wanted attention

368
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I did

369
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
so I thought

370
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I'd just

371
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
look something up on my phone

372
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
and get out of my system

373
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
nothing was doing anything

374
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
all the things I'm normally into

375
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I'm not interested

376
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
I had to download twitter on my phone

377
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
and sign in so I could listen to an odd

378
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
your audio

379
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
and when I heard you I was finally able to

380
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I'm mind broken you

381
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
but I'm not even done it yet

382
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
I said before that I was mind broken

383
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
but I meant it in the way that I was mainly

384
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
interested in what you're making

385
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I'm only interested in

386
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
inking to you

387
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
my brain will only let me ink to you

388
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
take responsibility

389
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
mommy

390
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
reflet oh no

391
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
you've been corrupted

392
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
oh my gosh

393
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Strony please for the love of everything

394
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
if you get a goth outfit

395
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
get a runny makeup toggle

396
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
oh you want a runny makeup toggle

397
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
stream ideal example for you

398
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
and it's a cat box link

399
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
oh my god I'm going to open up a cat box link

400
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
I swear to god if I'm getting pranked by a pintus

401
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
oh right

402
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
oh no no no

403
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
I understand I've seen that feature before

404
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
he did it

405
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Strony life goes to be honest

406
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
it's not makeup

407
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
she just has ink dripping down her face

408
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
hmm

409
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
will there be a discord server at some point

410
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,500
for reflance to speak

411
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
unfortunately no

412
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
yeah

413
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
for the safety

414
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
of myself and all talents

415
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
there's no

416
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,500
velour

417
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
speakable discord

418
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
there is a notification discord

419
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
if you want to keep up with shorts

420
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
if you want to keep up with streams

421
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
videos

422
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
because there's a lot of things that get pushed out

423
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
even if you hit that cheeky

424
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
notification bell

425
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
youtube will still not push out

426
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
the key intent

427
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,500
running makeup

428
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
you better go catch it

429
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
thank you

430
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
thank you

431
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I'll be here

432
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
sometimes I'm glad I met you

433
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
I'm glad I met you too reflin

434
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
hi Strony

435
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,500
hi reflin

436
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
god you look so adorable in the bathtub

437
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
you look so cute and lovable and nervous

438
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I want to hug you forever

439
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
you look amazing

440
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
and the goth recolour too

441
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
it fits you super well

442
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
black is always your colour

443
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
someone sent me the most sussiest link of all

444
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
that I've never even seen in my life

445
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
nope as if I'm clicking that

446
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
nice try

447
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
it seems mummy ain't just got the eyes to hypnotise

448
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
it's your whole deal that makes you a blessed meal

449
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
are you winning

450
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
we ain't even started yet

451
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I'm trying to drink my tea

452
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
so it's still hot

453
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
not room temperature

454
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
but we are about to start playing in a moment

455
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
but yes lots of interesting things for the girls

456
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
we've got emotes coming out soon

457
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
we have a collab coming out in someone else's channel

458
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
the ball is now in their court

459
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
thank fucking god

460
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
cause I hate the ball being in my court

461
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
it annoys me

462
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I've got a collab coming out with a vtuber

463
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Sun Tiem

464
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
as always Sun Tiem with me

465
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
hey mummy

466
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
maybe bad thing to say

467
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
but did the collab this week go through

468
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
it's getting rescheduled

469
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
it's been rescheduled

470
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Katarina is having me on the

471
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
the 8th for the rest of the world

472
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
the 9th for Aussies

473
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
all of September

474
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
it had to get rescheduled

475
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
cause there was a few issues with timing

476
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
but yes Katarina is having me on her channel next month

477
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
not this month

478
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
it was a reschedule issue

479
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
that we came across

480
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
and then together we defeated the rescheduling issue

481
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
by destroying it into smithereens

482
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
and now we were the winners of that

483
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
hi strongy

484
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
just a little feedback

485
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,500
you seem really quiet recently

486
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
yes the microphone has not been in my mouth

487
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
the microphone is right next to my mouth

488
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm kissing the microphone

489
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I probably sound so clear

490
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
compared to other streams

491
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
unfortunately I've been a lazy bum

492
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
and not been sucking the microphone off

493
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
hi

494
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
sorry for you to enter

495
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
as soon as I said that sentence

496
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I need goth mummy to blackmail me

497
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I need you to step on me

498
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
oh I never commissioned that artwork actually

499
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm going for gore

500
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
oooh

501
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,500
speaking of donathon

502
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
what exactly is yours and how long will it go on for

503
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
we're going to discuss it in the membership stream

504
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
but no leaks

505
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
no leaks

506
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
we're going to discuss what the plan is for me

507
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
cause I

508
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
I am a bit different in terms of donathons

509
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I don't mind speaking about this

510
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
so most donathons are like personal

511
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
it's like moving out

512
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
you know security money

513
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
because this kind of job doesn't last forever

514
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
if you want to call it a job

515
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
personally I don't fuck if this is a job

516
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
fuck I'm fucking shitting

517
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
huffing to you right now I'm writing scripts

518
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I'm having fun I'm collabing

519
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
yeah job job

520
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
yeah yeah wink wink nudge nudge

521
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
oh I feel so overworked

522
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
no

523
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,500
mine are related to

524
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
advancing other people

525
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
in terms of

526
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
confirmation that gen 2 production occurs

527
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
does that mean there's a

528
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
confirmation date when gen 2 come out

529
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
no it just means that production is confirmed

530
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
production is

531
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
one very expensive

532
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
two takes a lot of time

533
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
as I said I was pregnant with the girls for a year

534
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
it took me an entire year of

535
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
pregnancy

536
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
with gen 1

537
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
but my donathon goes

538
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
you know I've already got everything I need

539
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
basically

540
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
you know I got my reflins

541
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
so mine are like

542
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
reward reward reward

543
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
public reward more more more content more more more

544
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
you know

545
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
hospital bills are insane nowadays

546
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
honestly for plopping

547
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
yeah plopping them all empty

548
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
yes

549
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
for how long my donathon is going to go on for

550
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
so Azura is just 12 hours

551
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
because she's you know hers is to move out

552
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
and she can't stream for like 40 hours in a row

553
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
up next is Shibi

554
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
and now I'm going to ask her if she wants to do

555
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
48 hours she doesn't have to do 48 hours

556
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
but if she wants to she can

557
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I might do the 48 hours type

558
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
bang as well

559
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
yes

560
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
yes

561
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
and basically I was going to play

562
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood through my whole

563
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
donathon

564
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,500
I know cringe

565
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
but I love Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

566
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
favourite game of all time

567
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,500
and it just makes me a happy little bean

568
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
when is Azura's donathon

569
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
so Azura's birthday is the 21st

570
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
of August

571
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
however her donathon is on Saturday

572
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
a 12 hour donathon on the 24th

573
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Saturday 12 hours she's playing

574
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
she is starting her donathon

575
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
at the

576
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
time I see usually starts

577
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm going to try and do it in your time zones

578
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
without having to actually name a time zone

579
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
and we are going to be showing up on her channel

580
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
and doing a collab

581
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
but some of the girls might be streaming on that day as well

582
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
but everyone will be redirecting back into Azura

583
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
so please don't do your thing

584
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
don't worry don't worry I'll plan it out

585
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
there's a trailer currently

586
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
advertisement trailer currently being made for Azura

587
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
I'm very curious how it's going to come out

588
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
very curious

589
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
very curious

590
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I'm making a trailer

591
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
and then I can attach it

592
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
and then we can put some googly ads behind it

593
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I'm going to be the first to kind of put ads behind it

594
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
stream trailer before

595
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
because it never really

596
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
for debut

597
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
things were really strange for debut

598
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,500
because the youtube accounts were so new

599
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500
it was hard to get anything fricking confirmed properly

600
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
it was really awkward

601
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
but I do try very hard

602
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
hey strony lovin be alert so far

603
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
I had a crazy dream of puppies

604
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
strony with their collar and leash

605
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
panting harder than Azura's

606
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
ahegyo toggle

607
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
you can't waning and begging for my ink

608
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
you've corrupted me

609
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
stay corrupted see what happens

610
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
hey

611
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
hi hi reflins

612
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
but young

613
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
lots of goody goody stuff

614
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,500
as I said now that a third editor is in play

615
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
my

616
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
my responsibilities are getting close to zero

617
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
like seriously

618
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
if the girls want an ASMR script

619
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
I write it that's about it

620
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
that's probably as close as we're getting now

621
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
to the point where I'm not even doing anything

622
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
so feels good man

623
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,500
and I can do

624
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
tons of rewards

625
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
and I can focus on my ASMR stuff

626
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
cause I got loads of collabs that are waiting on me

627
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
it's just a long awaited sequel

628
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
to mummy commits tax fraud exactly

629
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
this comes right after tax fraud

630
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
let me finish his teeth

631
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
and now work on gen 2

632
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,500
well gen 2 I don't work on it actively

633
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,500
because I'm not like the creator of the designs

634
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm not the one making the ref sheets

635
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
I'm not the one making the lures

636
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm basically the one that goes

637
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500

638
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500

645
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500

god how do I survive

941
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
what are you

942
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
I'm running out of voices

943
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
accent German

944
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
how do you like my property

945
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I think it's very nice

946
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
and cosy

947
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
okay

948
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
oh I've got 2 minutes left

949
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
what's this

950
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
it's a new boy

951
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
I've been studying the floor plans

952
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
of the botanical plant I've learned that these elevators are special

953
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
see these elevators lead to completely random rooms

954
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
wait as you tour

955
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
it seems like that the bank security system

956
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
is wired to swap them out

957
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
whenever someone breaks in

958
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
I think there means

959
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
we're going to have to rob this place

960
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
several times to get the full picture

961
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
so grab what you need to escape in the truck

962
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
and then get this place to reshuffle

963
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
what the fuck does that mean

964
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
give me the money

965
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
from milk to eminem

966
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
this is very

967
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
wiggly swiggly this time around

968
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
like this

969
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I know you can't really tell

970
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
but it's very wiggly

971
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
French

972
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
I have used

973
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
bleh

974
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
thank you bleh and refling senpai

975
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
for the extended membership

976
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I'm very slip like refling's pills

977
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
that's an interesting way to secure a bank

978
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
I don't understand

979
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
French

980
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
I used to be a

981
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
big flipping

982
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
young individual like yourself

983
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
now I stand here protecting these elevators

984
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
with my life

985
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
that's what I'm trained to do

986
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
I dabble in tourism as well

987
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
come back to me if you want little facts about these rooms

988
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
turnip head

989
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
based on our intel you can't trip over unstable blue lasers

990
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
there has to be

991
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
there has to be a circuit

992
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
wait no wrong

993
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
oh I am walking here

994
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
there has to be a circuit box

995
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,500
you can't break to shut them off

996
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
shut them off

997
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
stop it

998
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
random

999
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
why

1000
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
wee

1001
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
wee

1002
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
wee

1003
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500

wee

1012

wee

1013
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
now we can see what's beyond

1014
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
the unstable blue lasers

1015
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
this seems easy maybe too easy

1016
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
step on it turnip head

1017
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500

easy

1026
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500

being

1050
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
being stuck in that pickle jar

00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
the valuable lesson

1056
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
that lesson being sometimes

1057
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
you need to steal to get

1058
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
what you want

1059
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,500

00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,500
what stinky has the vaults

1063
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
of all the vaults somewhere on the botanical

1064
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,500
being

1065
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
we have to

1066
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,500
find the

1067
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
mystery wait what in the

1068
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,500
runescape doubling money

1069
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
is this text

1070
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,500
we have to find

1071
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,500
the mysterious mother load

1072
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
to make this whole

1073
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
thing worth it to be

1074
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
able to put all of this behind

1075
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
us go deeper and see

1076
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
what you can find

1077
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,500
uh

1078
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500

I've got something that should come in handy

1081
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
okay hi

1082
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
welcome to my new lab

1083
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Dilettini gave

1084
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
me a good deal for getting you guys

1085
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
on the dark web on the computer over there

1086
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
so make sure you buy

1087
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
anything you need from it

1088
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
from what Dilettini

1089
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
has told me we'll be using

1090
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,500
your money to pay

1091
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
for these things

1092
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
yes Dilettini

1093
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
says we've got a tight budget

1094
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
go check out the dark web

1095
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
and see if there's anything that can be

1096
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,500
of use c4 c4

1097
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,500
oh oh no we

1098
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
can't afford

1099
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
well we can afford the c4

1100
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
purchase an eye almost in dark web

1101
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,500
okay we can

1102
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
now

1103
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,500
wait there's another thing I need to do

1104
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,500
yeah I can't afford that

1105
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
task completo

1106
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,500
why does the avocado

1107
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,500
you don't want to shag the avocado what's going on

1108
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,500
you know she's got a big seed

1109
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,500
in the middle right

1110
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
it just

1111
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
works okay

1112
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
so what I'll go back into the bank

1113
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
oh they're gone actually

1114
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
walking here Robo Raphael

1115
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
keeps saying we're making financial

1116
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
gains when we should be making

1117
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
physical ones

1118
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
I suppose it doesn't matter more money for us

1119
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
when we totally absolutely for sure

1120
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
split the end profits

1121
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
we'll be making the real gains

1122
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
when we find stinky

1123
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
secret stash we need to

1124
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
get deeper into the bank voice

1125
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
make sure you're talking to the locals

1126
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
to get the scoop on what's happening

1127
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
and don't forget to go on the dark web

1128
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
if you need anything to brute force

1129

00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
location every time

1213
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500

for the finding

1295
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
for the funding but there's a lot

1296
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
of secrets within the bank

1297
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,500
as the brains

1298
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
of this operation and having an

1299
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,500
insatiable need to quench my

1300
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
curiosity I want

1301
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
to try and uncover these secrets

1302
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,500
I have a feeling that this

1303
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,500
isn't just a bank

1304
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,500
most of this structure is from

1305
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,500
the all the world stinky

1306
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,500
has just been building onto it

1307
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
why is he here

1308
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,500
what is his plan

1309
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
I need to catalog anything

1310
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
that you think is strange

1311
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
just snap a photo

1312
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,500
on your phone as photo spots

1313
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
an album app will appear on

1314
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
your phone so you can look at what

1315
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
you've captured we'll correct

1316
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,500

other things steroids inject

1488
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,500

I farted my money away

1595
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
you have to rule

1596
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,500
of course I have to rule

1597
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,500
I forgot about the mechanic

1598
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,500
right

1599
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,500
so I've lost me fishy

1600
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
wait so then

1601
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
if I want to start upgrading

1602
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
upgrade

1603
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,500
upgrading like health

1604
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
it's 5k for health

1605
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,500
sure I'll put luck in it

1606
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,500
okay we're just gonna go on a money trip

1607
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,500
straddling boys

1608
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,500
we're going on a money trip

1609
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
we're just gonna go straight for money

1610
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,500
because I want to get tons of enhancers

1611
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,500
I think once I got all the enhancements like this game

1612
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
it becomes easy belem squeeze

1613
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
funk

1614
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
that's right I know you're there

1615
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
I know you're there

1616
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
shakey shakey shakey

1617
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
this is a very cute game I like it

1618
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
I don't know if you guys have played it

1619
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
but I'm tempted to say

1620
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
I recommend

1621
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
although it's quite a reading simulator

1622
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
I know maybe not like

1623
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
all

1624
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
strommers would like

1625
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
voice it all and stuff

1626
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,500
are you squidding me right now

1627
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,500
10 months of being a reflanding ward

1628
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,500
not only tax evasion

1629
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,500
but taking what isn't ours as well

1630
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,500
it's the best games

1631
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,500
I can't believe I completely forgot

1632
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,500
about the dodge mechanic

1633
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,500
stop

1634
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,500
I don't know if my controller

1635
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,500
slightly bugged

1636
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,500
not to be dramatic

1637
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,500
or blame it on anything

1638
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,500
but I haven't feeling my controller

1639
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,500
it's a little bit bugged

1640
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
because it's like acting so weird

1641
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,500
I have reverence

1642
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,500
get I'm strong these guys

1643
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,500
got nothing on you

1644
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,500
I got a mobile phone

1645
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,500
someone's phone that's a very nice

1646
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,500
oh wait does the gold

1647
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,500
crates have a chance to drop money

1648
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,500
hmm

1649
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,500
right so that person

1650
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,500
is always going to be done this hallway

1651
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,500
surely it's the controller

1652
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
it's not slippery I'm not kidding

1653
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,500
that's why I keep saying oh it's so slippery

1654
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,500
and no I'm not just saying that because ha ha

1655
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,500
refling ink ha ha ha ha

1656
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,500
no like genuinely it's a slip and slide

1657
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,500
like I'm trying to aim a bit

1658
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,500
but I'm not sure if there's like

1659
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
the lair or something

1660
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,500
we're gonna see how much our maximum

1661
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,500
amount is for the bag

1662
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,500
get that bag

1663
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,500
we're at 1400

1664
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,500
1.5

1665
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,500
we're at 1.5

1666
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,500
so

1667
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
1.6 is never a maximum

1668
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,500
I've got men alive they're going men alive

1669
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,500
I've got other good first aid kits on the wall

1670
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:49,500

1671
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,500
okay the enemy seems to

1672
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,500

1673
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,500

01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,500
a lot of money

1693
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
3.5

1694
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
yay

1695
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
we're getting rich off of this bank

1696
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
thank god they're too dumb to

1697
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,500
get stronger

1698
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,500
GG

1699
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
gun

1700
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500
trip maximum health not yet

1701
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,500
I don't even use the gun

1702
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,500
bullets do more damage

1703
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,500
an additional minute

1704
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
on the timer

1705
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,500
maybe

1706
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,500
increased melee damage seems like the best

1707
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
cause I'm always whacking sure I'll buy the merch

1708
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
new hat available

1709
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,500
aww

1710
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,500
we got some dosh we got some real dosh

1711
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,500
so there's nothing new a laser pointer

1712
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,500
I'll buy it cause I assume it's

1713
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,500
for something later but

1714
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,500
oh no that pickled banana

1715
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,500
uh hey

1716
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
uh yeah um

1717
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,500
that avocado said they'd give

1718
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,500
me money if I just stayed in the star filled

1719
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
with green goop

1720
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,500
it's not too bad I do feel a little tingly

1721
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
though

1722
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
I don't know how long I'm supposed to be in here

1723
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,500
or how I'm getting out wait

1724
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,500
have I been kidnapped

1725
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,500
I mean

1726
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
yes

1727
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,500

1728
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500

1729
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,500
my weird weapon

1730
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
are you sure you want to swap wait

1731
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,500
who was it is it you that upgrades the fish

1732
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,500
research a weapon

1733
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,500
I researched

1734
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,500
a fidget

1735
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
and then what I need to equip

1736
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,500
my weapon

1737
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,500
oh this is such a thingy

1738
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,500
uh

1739
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,500
refling POV

1740
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,500
don't give me ideas since I joined them

1741
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,500
I'm just trying to reason

1742
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,500
you just got rid of the fishy I lost my fishy

1743
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,500
give me my fishy back

1744
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,500
I said give me my fishy back

1745
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
okay so next

1746
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,500
upgrade I will do

1747
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,500
we'll get money again on this round and then I'll upgrade

1748
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,500
health and then I'm going against that

1749
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,500
stinky bank manager again cause we can

1750
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,500
100% get that cowboy

1751
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,500
that cowboy don't stand a chance

1752
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,500
against someone like me

1753
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,500
oh sorry let me shake this

1754
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,500
watermelon

1755
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,500
what a minute

1756
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,500
remember that time I never got a watermelon in suica

1757
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
game and that's literally the only objective

1758
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,500
in that game is to get that

1759
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,500
and I never got it cause I

1760
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,500
I actually wanted

1761
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,500
I saw a vtuber highlight video

1762
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:11,500
and it was like vtubers react to their first time

1763
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,500
getting a watermelon and I'm like

1764
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,500
I'm raging cause obviously

1765
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,500
I never got a watermelon and now it makes me want

1766
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,500
to go for a watermelon

1767
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,500
I don't know if maybe I should do an endurance stream

1768
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
and I don't go offline until I get

1769
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,500
the watermelon

1770
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:27,500
but I don't know if that's a terrible idea

1771
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
but we could do it

1772
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,500
we could do endurance stream don't go offline until

1773
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,500
what a minute

1774
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
okay we're getting quite

1775
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,500
a lot of things

1776
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,500
40 hour endurance stream inbound

1777
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,500
real and true

1778
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,500
ow

1779
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,500
ow

1780
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,500
I'm stuck on the box

1781
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
jeez I'm getting walloped this round

1782
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,500
this is why I want more health

1783
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,500
jeez

1784
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
oh he burps

1785
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,500
little boobies

1786
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
endurance stream into warm-up gets on the first try

1787
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
I doubt it I was like really

1788
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
struggling but I would be

1789
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,500
down for those like cana silly endurance streams

1790
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
where it's like it's not impossible

1791
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,500
and it is a wee bit of luck

1792
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,500
I'm not really sure how much skill

1793
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,500
is involved

1794
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
there's not really much up here

1795
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,500
I'm breaking everything

1796
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,500
oh wait

1797
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
I'm going to take the cactus so I can research

1798
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
the cactus

1799
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,500
I'm going to research this cactus so hard

1800
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,500
okay let's do this

1801
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,500
the bomb almost seems like a good bet

1802
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,500
40 hour endurance in the heavenly

1803
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,500
okay

1804
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,500

1805
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,500
right we need to go back to the

1806
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,500
trip in a moment

1807
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,500
is this a shotgun

1808
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500

1809
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,500

1810
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,500

oh my god it doesn't have

1813
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
much spread but I guess if I keep

1814
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
researching the weapon

1815
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,500
it'll be nicer to me

1816
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500

oh no I only have a gun

1838
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
I don't think my gun is very

1839
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,500
strong

1840
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,500

1841
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,500

01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,500
anyway I start blasting

1845
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,500
okay yeah that's

1846
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,500
what I was worried about

1847
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,500
that I'm going to like I have to

1848
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,500
actually aim and stuff yeah it's

1849
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,500
shocking I don't want to have to aim

1850
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,500
but I'm going to have to

1851
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
wait I can't

1852
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,500
I can't

1853
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,500
because I can't smash the ATMs

1854
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500

1860
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,500
I guess we can destroy the stat use

01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,500
we will destroy the stat use

1862
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,500

01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,500
I don't know if I can continue

2067
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,500
very very low health indeed

2068
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,500
I wonder

2069
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,500
oh hello carrot

2070
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
oh yes a new visitor

2071
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,500
I've been waiting for

2072
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,500
someone new to join my movement

2073
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,500
for a while now

2074
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
it's been so long since I've seen a new face

2075
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
ew what's that

2076
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
you don't have yourself a cardboard box

2077
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
I'm afraid

2078
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,500
I can't let you in without one

2079
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,500
my sweet child

2080
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,500
and once you have opened your mind

2081
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
body and soul and acceptance

2082
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,500
of our rectangular overlords

2083
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,500
I will allow you to pass

2084
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,500
you

2085
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,500
shall not

2086
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,500
pass

2087
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,500
ok

2088
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,500
woah that was worth so much

2089
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,500
maybe I misread that

2090
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,500
ok

2091
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,500
I finally got health so at least I'm not

2092
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,500
absolutely perishing

2093
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,500
there is

2094
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,500
so much to do in this game

2095
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,500
yeah there's definitely

2096
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,500
no way I'm able to wrap this up in 2 hours

2097
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,500
like zero freaking chance

2098
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,500
zero chance for wrapping this up in 2 hours

2099
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,500
where did I come from

2100
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,500
where did you come from where did you go

2101
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,500
where did you come from

2102
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,500
right we're going to head back to the trick

2103
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
but yeah so far loving this

2104
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,500
did I not kill him on the way in

2105
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,500
that's like the first time I've never not

2106
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,500
killed him

2107
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,500
secret endurance stream

2108
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,500
no no no I've got to do the video game

2109
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,500
I have to do the video game

2110
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
5000 in one house

2111
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
we could probably get an upgrade

2112
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,500
I'll see what's on the dark web

2113
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,500

2114
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,500

2116
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,500

2117
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,500

2118
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,500
wait hold on I don't want

2119
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,500
oh but it's so weak

2120
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,500
but it sprays more

2121
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,500
um

2122
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,500

we can get the rain out

2134
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
inflation is crazy

2135
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,500
uh right

2136
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
we will do a quick haze

2137
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
um

2138
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,500
wait

2139
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,500
how am I selecting this so terribly wrong

2140
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,500
right that one

2141
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,500
make it right there we go

2142
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
we'll do one more haze very quickly and get that

2143
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
cardboard box

2144
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,500
this is a stick up

2145
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,500
this is a stick up

2146
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,500
uh yeah see like

2147
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,500
they can tolerate quite a lot of the bullets

2148
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,500
but

2149
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
um

2150
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
but I can spray them down before they even have time

2151
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,500
to react to be fair it's

2152
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
causing a lot more destruction

2153
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
which

2154
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
might be good

2155
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,500
right we'll get our little cardboard

2156
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,500
box for freaking a billion dollar

2157
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500

2160
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,500
oh wait no we need

2161
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
we don't have the cardboard box yet so we don't need

2162
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,500
to go left yet

2163
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,500
can you upgrade weapons yes

2164
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,500
most likely

2165
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,500
no these are all mp2

2166
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,500
um

2167
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,500
can't get in without that car yet okay so we

2168
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,500
don't need to do anything on that side

2169
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
of the map is the boss room

2170
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
got anything to scavenge

2171
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,500

2174
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,500
finish fight you at least one time

2175
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,500
only once other than

2176
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
that I'm naffin if you provoke

2177
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,500

right okay so you can

2180
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,500
you can replay

2181
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,500
sorry I thought I actually did not boss fight

2182
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,500
so you can replay if you so desire

2183
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,500
but I don't desire I just want

2184
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,500
to get mula

2185
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,500
we've got all up here in New York

2186
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
yeah

2187
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,500
well get ready for the suica

2188
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,500
right singy then

2189
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,500
the music is really good in this game as well

2190
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,500
okay we'll main this get the cardboard

2191
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,500
box go back to the carrot and see what the deal

2192
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,500
is over on that part

2193
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
from around these parts I'm from around

2194
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,500
these parts

2195
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,500
so far I

2196
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,500
I think maybe stream wise

2197
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,500
this game is a bit difficult to stream

2198
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,500
but like if if I was

2199
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,500
just being chilling on my own

2200
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
and with my

2201
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:01,500
thoughts I think I'd like enjoy

2202
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,500
just like tuning out and playing this game a bit

2203
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,500
mindlessly I don't know

2204
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,500
if that's like controversial oh I got

2205
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,500
my shotgun again out out out I'm getting

2206
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,500
stuck out she

2207
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
that keeps happening to me

2208
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
why does this

2209
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,500
happen to me

2210
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,500
okay so the shotgun

2211
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,500
kills them in one which is what I want to

2212
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,500
see

2213
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,500
the sheriff's room had a green door

2214
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,500
at the very north of it

2215
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,500
I didn't pay attention

2216
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,500
okay all right now we

2217
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
can break into this one

2218
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,500
by the cardboard box say hello to the carrot

2219
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
no sugar this is

2220
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,500
the wrong one I keep going the wrong way

2221
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,500
if there's only one shakedown oh wait no

2222
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
oh it's this

2223
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
one more bomba

2224
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
go go have a good one starting recently

2225
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
thank you for hanging

2226
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,500
anyway I thought

2227
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
it's blessed

2228
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
okay it does have a reload timer

2229
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
I mean that makes sense because

2230
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,500
you know shotguns

2231
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
oh no

2232
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
oh

2233
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,500
I've never forgotten the time before

2234
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,500
whoopsies

2235
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,500
that's the first time I've ever forgotten the time

2236
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
I'm scared

2237
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,500
go away Mr. Bacon

2238
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
oh no

2239
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
okay

2240
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,500
that was a

2241
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
that was a mistakey-wakey on my part

2242
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
we didn't realize

2243
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
Astroni having a whiskers in attention

2244
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,500
fancy

2245
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,500
so literally I'm gone

2246
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,500
right we need cardboard box

2247
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,500
give me cardboard box

2248
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
and then

2249
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,500
upgrade weapon

2250
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,500
we just

2251
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,500
unlocked a shotgun as well

2252
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,500

so let me just back my

2325
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,500
arse up real quick because I'm not doing a

that's no one I'm not doing it

2330
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:57,500
I'm not doing a 40 second boss fight

2331
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,500
you can argue amongst yourselves

2332
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,500
where am I

2333
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,500
oh they have extraction points

2334
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,500
oh they're so smart

2335
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,500
so you don't have to go all the way

2336
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,500
back

2337
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,500
not the not quality

2338
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,500
of life

2339
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,500
not quality of life enhancement

2340
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,500
off the bat

2341
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
what a fantastic dev team

2342
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
quality of life off the bat

2343
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,500
you don't have to backtrack

2344
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,500
all the way

2345
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
and you pay a little fee for it

2346
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,500
who what a polish

2347
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,500
game

2348
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,500
dev teams instantly thinking

2349
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,500
of quality of life stuff

2350
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,500
bathwater

2351
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,500
wait is that sleigh queens

2352
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,500
bathwater

2353
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
I think it is

2354
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,500
I think it is

2355
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,500
new favourite strongy game series

2356
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,500
bell delphine

2357
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,500
did you hear about that

2358
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,500
she never even got the money for it

2359
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
because PayPal shut her account down

2360
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,500
she like made no money from it

2361
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:01,500
because PayPal stole all

2362
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
that's why you never hold your money in PayPal

2363
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,500
it's rather insane

2364
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
really

2365
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,500
oh let's research

2366
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:15,500
this bomb bar

2367
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,500
okay and then let's equip

2368
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,500
the shawty

2369
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,500
yes I took a little sip a little hydration

2370
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,500
right I'm just gonna check

2371
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,500
that increases luck increases distance

2372
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
trip

2373
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,500
faster cool

2374
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,500
apologies when

2375
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,500
spilled no point in crying over

2376
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
assuming maybe defense there's something

2377
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,500
the bullets do more damage I think we're gonna have to

2378
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,500
oh I want timer though

2379
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,500
okay damage and timer

2380
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,500
that's gonna help us with quality of life

2381
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,500
great

2382
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,500
oh she's got a question on her head

2383
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,500
stinky seems to have

2384
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,500
pretty bad reputation here

2385
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,500
there have been a lot of

2386
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,500
refugees coming to the botanical

2387
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,500
bay

2388
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,500
for shelter after the war

2389
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:01,500
it seems like stinky doesn't love the idea

2390
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,500
of people moseying

2391
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,500
into his face without his permission

2392
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,500
yeah he definitely

2393
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,500
he's definitely not gonna like his fun

2394
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,500
PayPal mafia

2395
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,500
I heard when she told us

2396
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,500
she had to write a disclaimer month later to not drink

2397
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,500
real when wheeler

2398
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,500
drops there are versions

2399
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,500
of our bathwater

2400
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:23,500
disclaimer please don't drink

2401
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,500
this is not for consumption

2402
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,500
Russian

2403
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,500

2404
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,500
did the hands and give them to me

2405
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,500
for science of course

2406
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,500
bunk

2407
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,500
bunk

2408
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
oh we got the upgrades

2409
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,500
on weapons to be

2410
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,500
how much is it from even stronger

2411
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:47,500
9k, 3, 2

2412
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,500
things again rather expensive

2413
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,500
look I don't want to drink that but

2414
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:53,500
things getting cheekily expensive

2415
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,500
bell delphine walk so wheeler can run

2416
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,500

2418
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,500
money although

2419
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,500
they aren't really dropping much money

2420
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,500
and

2421
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,500

2422
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:09,500

not concerned

2424
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,500
but

2425
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,500
it's definitely gonna take quite a few runs

2426
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,500
I know that there's that like

2427
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,500

01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:47,500
I'm a turnip on edge

2442
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
oh it's like an assault rifle this time

2443
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,500
as if that touched me

2444
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,500
you're burping me burping

2445
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,500
there's also a father friend

2446
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,500
the face of turnip when he's shaking

2447
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,500
I'm done

2448
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,500
I wasn't paying attention

2449
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,500
oh this doesn't have a limited ammo

2450
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,500
I need to be careful

2451
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,500
okay there is like a sleigh

2452
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
which I'm quite happy

2453
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:25,500
they can see me before I freaking

2454
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,500
come on screen

2455
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
they can see me

2456
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
they can see me before I steal them

2457
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
oh this is fucking

2458
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,500
cheating

2459
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,500
yes give me that

2460
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,500
I don't even know

2461
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
I think I'm going to need damage upgrades

2462
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
before I start dealing with these folk over here

2463
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,500
oh there's a hidden person here

2464
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
what is it

2465
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,500
it's like a gun for

2466
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,500
of a frog

2467
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,500
ow

2468
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:07,500
I'm getting a bullet right there

2469
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,500
hmm

2470
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:11,500
turnip

2471
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,500
come to thingy for an upgrade

2472
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,500
yes yes yes

2473
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,500
I'm just spraying

2474
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,500
anyway a thought's blessed

2475
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,500
now come

2476
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,500
on stream

2477
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,500
okay so I can

2478
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:27,500
take two researchable items

2479
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,500
back

2480
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,500
I'm

2481
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,500
these look exactly like the trees from

2482
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,500
the legend of Zelda I said it

2483
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,500
I said it right I'm not doing the boss fight

2484
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,500
I'm too terrified but

2485
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,500
we have been able to at least

2486
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,500
explore this area quite a bit

2487
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,500
how did you even get over there

2488
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,500
I have no idea

2489
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:51,500
I mean we could

2490
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,500
okay

2491
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,500
the noise this

2492
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,500
oh no my money's full

2493
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,500
right okay so the wallet is 2.5K

2494
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,500
right take us home

2495
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,500
I'm not going to use the

2496
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,500
turn style thing because it's going to cost

2497
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
me money but

2498
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,500
we officially know that the max amount

2499
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,500
of money we can carry is 2.5K

2500
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,500
but that doesn't include like

2501
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:19,500
trinkets that we can take back with us

2502
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,500
there's another one

2503
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,500
yes okay

2504
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,500
our money is full so there's no point

2505
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:29,500
we can take trinkets trinkets are different

2506
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,500
they are calculated

2507
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,500
differently

2508
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,500
are you inking everywhere

2509
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,500
is that the sound of you inking

2510
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,500
get a complimentary bottle

2511
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,500
of strony's bath water where every part

2512
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
is

2513
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,500
just shy 7K not bad

2514
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,500
alright and then we're going to

2515
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:49,500
in

2516
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,500
research both of these weapons

2517
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:53,500
about an assault rifle

2518
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,500
he's getting cheeky

2519
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,500
oh right

2520
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,500
we don't want luck

2521
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,500
I do think I want help though

2522
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,500
weapons I can't really increase

2523
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,500
I don't know what spilt milk is

2524
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,500
but

2525
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,500
maybe the gun one for

2526
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
research

2527
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,500
oh wait what was that thing

2528
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,500
there's something here

2529
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
oh no the bath

2530
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,500
a lantern I don't know why we need

2531
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,500
a lantern just yet

2532
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,500
I got back from sailing

2533
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,500
no idea it's such an easy thing to do

2534
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,500
oh yeah you let the wind carry you

2535
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:31,500
can't believe it you're not a real

2536
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,500
sailor this is why I quit sailing

2537
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,500
there's too many sweats

2538
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,500
a lot of kill possibilities for marriage

2539
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,500
but bath water is not something I don't want

2540
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,500
oh you wouldn't

2541
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,500
you wouldn't want cuttlefish

2542
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,500
like soup base

2543
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,500
how dare you

2544
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,500
spilt milk

2545
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,500
what happens when you drop the jar

2546
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,500
oh that's why I'm going to drop the jar

2547
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,500
what

2548
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,500
I will take six bottles of strontis

2549
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,500
exactly

2550
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,500
I'm not sure what to invest in

2551
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,500
or just keep my money and maybe

2552
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,500
oh there's only one more health upgrade

2553
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:07,500
and then that's it I'm done so

2554
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,500
oh

2555
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,500
hmm that's curious

2556
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,500
maybe I can do the boss fight then

2557
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,500
right fuck it we're going to do the boss fight

2558

whoa you got a death wish or something

2560
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,500
oh I forgot to

2561
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,500
pick up my weapons after dropping them

2562
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,500
okay

2563
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,500
okay okay okay okay

2566
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,500

Canadians it wasn't supposed to be like this

2575
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,500
it was supposed to be different

2576
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,500
I'm sorry I killed you because I suck at the game

2577
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,500

I don't know if it's better to do melee against these bottles

2584
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,500
okay

2585
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
melee is definitely

2586
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,500
better against these guys

2587
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,500
okay okay

freeloaders were giving me a hard time

2593
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,500
we were here first they say

2594
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,500
when I asked them to give me all their money

2595
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,500
I decided to play nice guy

2596
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,500
and throw a festival to win their favour

2597
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,500
we were talking about

2598
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,500

fat kids in leaf

2606
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,500
what the only good

2607
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,500
thing about you being here now is you can deal with it

2608
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:13,500
