00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Wow...

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Tasting, tasting...

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
My voice is sharp before any...

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Yes, get excited!

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Testing...

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Microphone test...

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Ah ah, microphone, okay.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Audio is a freaking thing.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Oh yeah, it's streaming time.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Are you guys there?

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Testing...

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Oh, YouTube gave me acknowledgement I'm live.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello...

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Good morning!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Good evening!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Good afternoon!

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
How are my little wiflings?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Very very sweet!

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
No one is going to get that reference.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Good morning!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
How are you?

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm currently glowing because of the events that occurred last night.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
After a stream that should not be named.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
You guys had some very interesting marshmallows for me when I woke up.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
I do have some good tiny VLR news.

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
AC and Emmys second batch of emotes have been accepted and paid for.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
So do hold your breath for them.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
The girls picked what emotes they want and they were very charming.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I think they're adorable.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.000
Up next is ordering Sheevee and Mersi's emotes.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm having to do it in batches.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
The wait time is 30 days.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
But as soon as they've been accepted it's just something in the background that I don't have to think about.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Which is fantastic.

02:00.000 --> 02:09.000
I am submitting my emotes last because I know how ever so patient my beautiful wiflings can be.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
So I do appreciate your patience until the new emotes do show up.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
We are getting there.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
We will soon be there.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
I will do that later.

02:24.000 --> 02:32.000
My voice is short unfortunately but hopefully the microphone is covering up the majority of how badly short it is.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
And I think we're just going for it.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We will wait as long as it takes.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
I think ours are going to show up in like 40 days which is quite a lot.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
Considering how much mome streams.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
I'll be a whole second but I mean I see their emotes have been submitted and I get to see the adorable drafts.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
The mot artist has already worked on them before so it might be a faster process.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Question mark.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I don't know.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I submitted to them the ref sheet.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
They're all the emotes and what they want here.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Time to diminish.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
No we are going to save.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
I have a cup of tea.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I've got a hot war ball.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
I may or may not have slapped myself a little too hard but I hope.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
That phantom we saw earlier.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
He said he had an ancient king of Hyrule.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
What else do we know?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
The element was nowhere to be seen in the wind runes.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I guess we'll just have to go to the place marked on our map.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
But first you should infuse your sword with that element.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Right okay.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
We have just picked up the third element.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
The element of water.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh the light.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
The skulls open up.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Hello.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
No.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
That's right.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I knew this was here for a child.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
Yeah someone was so adorable in message and they were like mome.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm like yeah.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
They were like mommy.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
What hole did you use?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
My refund.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Bless you.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Hope.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Brained where are you?

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
Did my language not unfair?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Where are we going?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I was going to say swimming pool.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Hi Sony what's the transformers last night?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Is this one I've ever had watching a movie?

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Oh I'm so glad.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I actually love doing watch-alongs.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Especially like on stuff I've never seen before.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Fucking hell it's going to take forever.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm lucky I picked up a bomb sack honestly.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I can't read the site from Marshmallow.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I have no clue.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
If you use firefox there should be a little extension for translation.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Unfortunately I don't use anything else but firefox.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
But I think you can all translate if you try hard enough.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Wait I can't...

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I can't do anything can I?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I can only get this.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Well oh well we got 100 for that.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh we can go buy an upgrade on something.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Yeah we cannot do anything.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
There's something to the bomb we can do unfortunately.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
I'm not sure what that is.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
We're currently just exploring because we've got access to the...

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh no they're having to do a time crunch.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Chomp chomp.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I'm always the last to finish eating.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Oh can't really...

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
How about you do you...

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
No no trading.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Oops.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
We're dying.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
We are very...

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
We are getting very close to finishing the game.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
As far as I'm aware.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I don't have that yet grrr.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Alright we can come back another time.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Oh there's a big guy up there.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Let's go get him.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Shonen's always a fed gopher.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Let's just let them have people eat slow.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
You made it here really quickly.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
You're filled with surprises aren't you?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It took me like one third of the game.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
But sure if you mean getting here quickly.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
There you go.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
That's so cute.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
That looks like...

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
No one wants to trade Kinstone pieces either.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And here my food I've got stuff to do.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Bruv honestly.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Hello thanks everyone for joining.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
I am not going to even pretend I know what's going on with the schedules.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Some people will be online.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Some people will be offline.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
That's it. That's all I know.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Don't ask me anymore because I don't know.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
What do you say?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
You've played this before.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
I have. This is a lovely childhood game of mine.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh we can give these girls houses.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Who do we think is the best here?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Do we do the green bunches?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Come on green bunches.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Yeah give us green bunches.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
No there's something really annoying about this little side quest we're about to do okay?

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
There will always be one girl that doesn't have a house because they didn't call to end.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
It's annoying.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Shira Fanta Fusion Ward.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Well I've just had the best idea.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I can rent out my house for some extra cash.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
No not long lords simulator.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
We can't escape.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
You've made a perfect match.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Singing in forever. What a bother.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
It's so nice to be here at last.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
We need to find a place to quiet and down.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It's so nice to be here at last in such a big townhouse.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Are these maybe they're a reference to another Zelda game?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
So now he can rent out but we need to find someone.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
What do you want? Why are you bothering me?

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh my name is Gorman. I'm trying to hand in real estate.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Turns out I'm a total pain.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
It's a total pain right now.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I'm looking for a 10 and you see the thing is I can only rent to a wimp.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Do you guys remember that reddit post that went semi viral?

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
Where the guy was like looking for a roommate.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
But you wouldn't have to pay if you're a woman.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
You'd just have to give up the goods basically.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah I don't know if you guys remember that but I do.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And it was pretty wild.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
You found me a house yesterday. Go rent.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Oh I remember that.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Yes.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay I knew I wasn't the one that knew about it.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
That was legit. It was pretty nice.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Right we actually can get access to the rooftop now.

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
Once we pick up the last item we're going to do a massive amount of exploring.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
Because you want to make sure you get naturally due.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Is that supposed to be the lead? No it's not.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
So my update last night.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah last night I was doing my research about this game.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
No chance. I don't think I can play sub six and make it interesting.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I'm going to be honest. I don't think I can make it interesting.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Strongest, strongest, strongest explorer.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Oh does he want to teach me anything here?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Hello.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Come again when you can jump further.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I never believed Sivir's your kind of game.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
It would be fun to just be like scorching it but...

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
Wait is this going to give me like 50 bombs then?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
That's a big bomb bag.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Well you are a big spender thank you.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
It does! It gives me 50 so I'm going to have 50 arrows as well.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Okay okay.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I assume the shield doesn't actually give me...

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
You already have a fine shield.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah I was going to say.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
We already have one I'm not sure.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
No one seems to want to fuse Kinstone pieces.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Have I like done everyone?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I think I might have done everyone in town.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Strongest big spender and she can handle deposit.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Hope you're having a good day.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah I'm having a cheeky slow morning.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I've got my cup of tea.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
I'm just letting it cool down a little bit.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
We'll go at the Castello and upgrade our equipment.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
We can...

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Oh look at that.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Zoom in.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Absolutely zoom in.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I think it would be...

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
It's a group club idea.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
They do an endurance club by each other and so...

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
Unfortunately the girls can't do that because they need to move out.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Or their parents are going to come flying in the room and be like,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Shut up!

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I love hedges!

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I love gardening!

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It's saving me from the snake!

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
That's kind of the problem.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
That's why I'm always like,

12:37.000 --> 12:42.000
Please support the girls because we have plans of moving to better locations and stuff.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I knew gardening would pay off.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
How long is stream today?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
I don't know.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
It depends how much time we piss off about.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Wow!

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I actually don't know how much longer.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Lore-wise?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
We only have one more item to unlock.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
You're in presence of the true master, Grimblade.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
If you train me, you become a master.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Would you like to train?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Yes please.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
I think we've only got like four more hours of gameplay.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
To learn the meaning of the power of this technique,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
you start with first, second, third.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Yeah, sure.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I was listening.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
But this is only the beginning.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
It comes to real thing.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
You must feel the technique.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
That's why I will never possess your body.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
With the Grimblade possession technique.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Watch this!

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Position!

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
No, I think it will be like four hours.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh wow, I can like shoot.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
You must try it yourself.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
When you're...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh, that's such a good thing.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Oh.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
No way!

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
I just like straight up have a laser beam now.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Do you teach me anymore?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
You're awesome.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Can you teach me more?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
No, there's nothing more I can teach you.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
But that's pretty cool.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
If I'm full health, I have a bullet now.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Possession.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
We refuse this forbidden stream allegation.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Oh my god.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I don't want to know the allegation.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Them allegunkns.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
I was outrageous that stream.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
But for anyone that gets annoyed with me going

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
bit, bit, bit for all the bees.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I visit her every hour to have much to offer

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
but you're welcome to stay.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Stop!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
They're so cute and humble.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
The stream didn't even get limited ads

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
even though the context of the stream

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
is absolutely outrageous.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Oh, the falling trees up.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
You can visit the Swordmaster at the lake.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Did I not?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Did we not go back?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I thought we went back.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
YouTube ads are such a working system.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Are you guys getting ads?

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I told them not to put them on stream.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Wah!

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh, well, I can definitely go to that lake right now.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
What?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
She's trying to gain it.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Right, so we basically just don't,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
just don't get caught by the AI.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I don't know how severe it is

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
or if it's like accessible.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Wah, it doesn't seem too bad.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Um...

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Who even gets bothered by the bees?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Well, literally, if you're considering,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
like, with a hook or something like that.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Here?

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
That doesn't seem right.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Woah!

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
No way I did that!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Wait, is there a hidden-

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Yeah, okay, let's definitely do the hidden stuff first.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm shooting my laser beam!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh my god, this is so OP!

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Sorry, but actually...

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
What is here?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Oh, I went the right way.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I went the right way.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Uh...

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
She's charging my laser.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
The laser's also two times your sword damage.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Are you winning, Strunnion Chat?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Yeah, we're infusing the third element!

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
We now are adding the water element to the sword.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
Which is fantastic.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I don't have my blanket and I'm

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
killing the circulation in my leg.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
It's my pure accident.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
I don't have access to my alternative Twitter.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
But I hope that audio did well.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
The power of the element allows you to

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
split into three copies now.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
That's cute.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
We're winning when Strunnion is on the screen.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
There we go, just like that!

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
The audio was Ace here.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
What is it?

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
I was like, oh, it's so cringe.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Like, I struggle so much to talk when I'm like that.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I was just like...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Please read me out.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
I was the best I got.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
I couldn't do it anymore.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Okay, glad you're in.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Ah, frickin', not to be...

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Yikes, my nerve.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Sorry, I just woke up.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
No, I didn't.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I didn't.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
No, you gave me money.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
I didn't get demonetized.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
That's what it's saying for people who

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
like hate when I go like burger bing-boot,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
but it's babas bing-boot.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
The reason why I brought it up is because

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
we didn't get...

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Gammy, stop it.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
Not again.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
We didn't get demonetized.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
But thank you for the tip.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Thank you for the super chat.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Was there something under here?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
There it was.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Burger bing-boot, that is.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
The bath we knew won.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
We knew won.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
We're doing it.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I don't know what we're doing,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
but we're doing it.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
We're not jumping down.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
We probably should go gambuzzle shells soon.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
What do you think, Link?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Pretty dark and spooky, isn't it?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Makes you want to cry, doesn't it?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
You're not scared?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, neither am I.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Come on, let's go.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I'm actually going to chug my tea.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
I do apologize.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Tell you what, we'll go to Hyrule

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
because it sounds a bit more nice.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
The background ambiance in Hyrule is a bit nicer.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Let me just slurp this tea.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
But thank you, Broly Legends99 underscore.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
You're getting very specific with the names here.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
We're on an adventure.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Big Ben Zershin.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
I have no clue what this is.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Like Big Bilbo Baggins.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Like Big Bilbo Baggins, Big Plugs.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Like Toys, that kind of thing.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Algo has no close stroneas.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm architect.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Oh, no, you can say architect

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
because it just sounds like architecture.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Don't forget to take them in if you haven't.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Oh, I'm already hired, okay.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
I changed my wind.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
She's gone, lads.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
The Vietnamese fucked me up real good

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
but they also have really good food

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
so I'll allow this discretion

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
that has been against me

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
via the Vietnamese.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
But I forgive you, Vietnamese lady

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
that destroyed my toe.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Yeah, I changed it.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Healing very beautifully.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm very happy to say

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
it doesn't look like there's any sign of infection.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Doesn't smell like that.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Not getting any indication.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
So I get to put a salt bath for it very...

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
I think in five, well, four days

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
to soak away what I can.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
They said you can use hot water

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
and swirl it around

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
but it's a bit too sensitive

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
for that at the moment.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
I'd rather not.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
But I'll do a salt bath shortly

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
but we're healing nicely.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Things are looking good.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
The painkillers are painkilling.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And life is good.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
I've got a few shorts

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
of the girls coming on the way

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
which I'm excited about.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm going to put some

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
cheeky advertisement money into

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
as I always do.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Mercy's short.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I thoroughly enjoyed

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Shout out to the editor.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
They just applied themselves

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
on the website

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
and they turned out to be

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
exactly what I was looking for.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Edit and style and all.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
And they've never complained

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
about any of the edits either.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
I love me.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I love me an edit and slave

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
that doesn't complain about work.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
I love it when you guys

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
still complain

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
and I get to put you at work.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
But he edited Mercy's

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Senpai Should I Be Blonde

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
and I've got everyone

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
to do a version of that.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I'm about to send that off.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Oh no.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Strony's removed Tony on chat.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
No.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I'm still here watching mommy.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Are you watching me in spirit?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Because you no longer exist.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
We're all willing slaves

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
on this farm.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Yes but not for cat-a-wise.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Not cat-a-wise.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Ever been jealous of an editor?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Yeah, me too.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I mean...

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Is it jealousy?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Is it jealousy

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
if I'm taking advantage

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
of the editor's hard work?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Is it jealousy

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
if I'm taking advantage?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Strony was here

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
peeling you in on the new Zelda game.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
I haven't...

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I'm still yet to see it actually.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
I do apologize.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
However, it looks fantastic.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I would watch it live with you guys.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
But if you didn't know,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
most game trailers

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
actually get copyrighted.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Because for promotional reasons

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
they get permissions

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
of certain songs

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
or additives

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
Yes?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
It should have been me.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
If you phrase it like that,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
yes.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, right.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Well, fucking relax.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
You know.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
I just put the files together.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
So, can I tell you some secrets?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
But these are bad secrets, okay?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
These are bad secrets.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
No one should know.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Oh, Tim...

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Tim Schrotto.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
Tim Schrotto.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
There, see?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Netherlands praten.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I'm from the Netherlands?

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
Thank you very much.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
One euro.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Thank you very much.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Streaming must not be named

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
was very useful.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
I am glad you guys didn't judge me.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
I honestly thought I was like,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
relatively like...

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
But, like, you know,

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I went exploring

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
and I was like,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
damn,

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
strong a freak.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
And I'm like,

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
am I actually?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Are you guys just scared to explore?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Please leave me alone.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Gami!

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Gami, when did you get your hair done?

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I've seen more degenerates.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Yeah, we're up there with you.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Okay, thank God.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Gami, I see you in that tree.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Don't think I don't see you, Gami.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Gami, don't be naughty.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Gami, that...

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Okay, that's just a quick way down.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Tharya, thank you for coming,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
a member.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Hi, BW.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
I was...

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I was like,

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
oh, you need to stay filled in.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
Right, what's the plan?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
What's the plan, Batman?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Up.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
What's the plan?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
What's the plan?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
You need to tell me the strategies.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Left.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Hmm, I know what left is.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Yes, yes, left.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Do you remember as a child,

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I couldn't do this section?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Same as before.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Left.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
Oh, no.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I wonder I couldn't do this as a child.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Same as the beginning.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
Up.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Up, left, left, up, right.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Up, left, left, up, right.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Same as two before.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Up, left, left,

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
left, up, right.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Up.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, thank god.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Don't ever make me do a logic puzzle again.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
The disrespect.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
The disrespect.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Make me do a logic puzzle first thing in the morning.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
There was a key that's needed tomorrow.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Okay, a key.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Oh, it's a new house.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
Oh, hello.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
My name's Dampi.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I'm a grave digger.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
What's that?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
You were called here by the ghost of the king.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
That'd be the ancient king of Hyrule who rests here.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
I've seen him myself.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Well, it's just king.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
I can't see any reason not to let you in here.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Take this key.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
Oh, that was a super easy little safe quest.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Mummy do be smart.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Well done.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Gami!

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Gami.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
What's with that crow?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
He up and flew away with a key.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Charge after him and get that dang key.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
I lost the key.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Have you got a spare?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
What?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
A crow took the key and flew away with the tree.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Well, don't just stand around and get the crow.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Charge at him and give him that tree a rattle if you want it back.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
If you stay with a person long of you,

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
spice things up.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Oh, yeah?

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Mellow to spice things up by going in the book.

27:33.000 --> 27:38.000
Oh, it was that quick.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
So we managed to get the key back.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Yeah.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Okay.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Please tell me it's not going to swoop down and yank it

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
and it was just like a little small side thing.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
I'll open the gate for you.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Be careful this time though.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Hello.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
I'm going to kill you.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Hello.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Yeah, let's fuse.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
I love crows but that behavior is unexpected.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
Oh, we never played that.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
What does it do?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
What have we just done?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Hey, I've just had a great idea.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
This will add you a little more risk.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
I'm so excited.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Curious.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
They fit perfectly.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Hi.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
What are you doing here?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
This is a graveyard.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
There's ghosts here.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Oh, yeah.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Speaking of which, my brother lives in town.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
He's a troublemaker prankster,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
but I often wonder what he's doing.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
Push.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
No.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
No.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Wait.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Why did that give me a noise though?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
Did he dig the grave?

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Surely not.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
Okay.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah, we're not doing that.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
How about this?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
No.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Oh, okay.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
We need to push through graves at a time.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Oh, we need to hit those buttons.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Wait, are these like all secret graves?

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
No great braving for our shock and behavior.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Look, I'm a child.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
I don't know the implicate.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Why would I move that one?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
And why did it give me the do-do-do-do-do-do-do?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Oh.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Can I do it?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
I can.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Can I?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Is that three or four?

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I took my legs off.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Oh, let's go.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
You got a piece of heart.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Dang straight, I got a piece of heart.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I'm just so good, baby.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
So this one didn't move.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
I wonder if the king's grave is up there.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
Surely a mystery.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
We'll never know.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Okay, let's try this again.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
No, no.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
It's just grave discovery.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
How do I get over there without breaking my guys?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Oh.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
I can just like pass through stuff.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Oh.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Oh.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
It may be the royal crepe, but graves are creepy.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
No matter where they are, where is the king's supposed to meet?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
I'm good stuff.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm not so sure.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
I even want to help anymore.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Can we just go somewhere that's less creepy?

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Oh my God, he took a hammer in.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
He took a hammer in.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm doing aimbot from halfway through.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I'm literally sniping him from the map.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
So that's horrifying.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
Oh no.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
What one is it?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Is it this one?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Because I can see a platform there.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
Right replaying.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Middle left or right?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
We just wanted to hold.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
You can burn the mummies with a lamp.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Right, get that lamp right here.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Middle was first.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
Oh, it doesn't make a difference.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
What's going on here?

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
What's going on?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Ah.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Oh wow, that disappeared so quick.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Okay, okay, okay.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I was getting a bit worried.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
I was getting a bit nervous that nothing was going to occur there.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Oh no.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
This is not good.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Do I have time?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Okay, that was freaking lucky.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Because that was not good.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
That was not good.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
But we did it.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
We did it.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
We did whatever challenge was necessary.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Further into the...

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
You...

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
The devs knew exactly what they were doing putting that there.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
That is so cheeky, honestly.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
Well, this totally doesn't look like a battle dome.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
How do I put them on fire?

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
How do I put them on fire?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Oh.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I need to give it a drive by.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You didn't tell me there were scallies underneath.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Of course the fires start attacking me too.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Oh wow, we like sped on that.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
We didn't even have to go left or right.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Yeah, can you speed it up a bit, mate?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Yeah, a bit quicker.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
I've not got all day, mate.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Yeah, a bit faster.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
You got a canstone piece.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
These mystic stones are said to bring happiness.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
Fascinating.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
An ancient king of Hyrule.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
How strange.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
And the source of the flow.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
What's that supposed to mean?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
Her fanny, mate, obviously.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Wait, no, you kicked me out.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
I didn't finish exploring.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Let me back in.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Wait, did I even have a key?

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Oh, they're fake doors.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
No way.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Oh wait, how did I get back?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Oh, suck, suck, suck, suck.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Mumbo.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I was like, you said it enough.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
A little cheeky suckage there.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
I got nervous there, right.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
We'll go thank the graveyard guy for letting me in.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Thank you.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Oh, he's already gone home.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
Honestly, I'd be home too.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
Hi.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Oh, less, less, less, up, up, up, down.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
What was that last time?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Yeah, let's fuse.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
What you got for me.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Stranny, I know you approve of dolls.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.000
What if the doll is taller than the person normally is?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
Has it all been done?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Oh.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Well, I guess we're going back to the graveyard.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
A tall, skeletal doll?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Cheeky skeletal moment?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
I don't know.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Oh, hello.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Hello.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Ah, so you moved the graveyard and now you can go outside.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
I'll get lonely.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Can you come see me sometime?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
I have plenty of Kinstones.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Oh, is this like infinite Kinstone person?

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Like a Slenderman doll.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
I don't think I could tolerate a Slenderman doll.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Oh.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Well, that's the source of the floor if I've ever seen one.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
A waterfall.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Hello.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
How many shells?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
I think we might need to gamble.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Oh, we're 700.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
Do you have any more to fuse together like you claimed young lady?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Oh, you do.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
I wonder if she's just an infinite...

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
I'll come back.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
I'll come back.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
I need to cut the grass, okay?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
The source of the floor is...

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Wow.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
I fucking got so nervous.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I was ready to pop at two minutes.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
I got a little heated during the stream.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
I was ready to pop after two minutes.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
I was like, bro, I can't.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.000
And then I got shy,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
so I actually lasted the normal amount of time

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
and I was like, yeah, this one's like...

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
What's in here?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Hello.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Well, we definitely need to gamble now after that.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
Yeah, I expected minutes just to be talking.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
No.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Are we really doing gamble?

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
I don't know.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Gamble time.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
Hello.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Traits.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
The odds of us getting the same thing is diabolical.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
If we end up with the same one figure percentage,

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
this just proves my gamble luck is just outrageously bad.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Aw, Zill and friends.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Zill is the one with the drippy nose.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
He likes to wander around town with his pals.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
He knows a lot about Hyrule and he might even give you some tips.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Aw.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
I don't...

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Right, we'll do this for like a whole four minutes, okay?

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
That's the best I got.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
Four minutes in me and then we'll move on to the actual gameplay.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I think we have to go top right now

37:36.000 --> 37:43.000
and then we unlock the last area and the last item.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
Um...

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Our probability is 97%.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
How many...

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Is there a hundred figurines on the door?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
You...

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Catch a game play.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
Golden rule.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
They call the snakes the rules.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
I mean, I guess.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
Okay.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Stunning hearing you finish...

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Oh.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Great.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Now she's cool to live.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Aw, wait a minute.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
I'm glad you...

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Bond Liz.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Thank you for the mimbo.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
There's a girl from my hero.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Your profile picture is bigger.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Let's take the girl from my hero.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
I just forgot the name.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
95%.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
Right.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I'll stop.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Yeah, tell you what, I'll make a deal.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
I'll stop once we get a duplicate.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
A chaser.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Yeah, those things were chasing me.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
They were getting my ankles, honestly.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
We'll stop when we get a duplicate so we can be hero.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Hemiko.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Yeah.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
There are 136 figurines total.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Okay.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
So the probability is two.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Well, I guess that's our gamble time over.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Thank you everyone for playing at home.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
I appreciate it.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
I appreciate it.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
Literally what the percentage is so high.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
And it was one that we had literally just go up.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Oh wait, I can swim now.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Right, can I still not get this?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It doesn't look like...

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I don't see a Minish entrance.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Oh, I need to jump with a freaking cape.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Right, okay, we're gonna go get a cape.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Right, no one wants to trade me.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
That's fine.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
We'll go get some switch for the reeflings

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
because I don't want you guys to be too hungry.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
On our adventure, I'll get you your lovely cape.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Yes, thank you.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Nothing this time.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
That's okay.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
As long as the reefling got some food in this, come on.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
I wonder what the mayor says now that we've been in his house.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I may look somewhat idle too, but no, sir.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
I'll be working terrifically hard as soon as you leave.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
You can bet that.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
Oh, he's just like classic doesn't do anything.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
Right, we now need to go top.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Right, let's speed things up a bit.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Get to work.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Oh, sorry.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Sorry, my bad.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Wait, is that a bump tree?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Oh, a cheeky bear.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Hey, I could actually use you right now

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
because I can't shoot my laser beam.

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
Thank you.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.000
Basically every polish.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Hey, you can't say that.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Oh, we can swim.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
Once we get the last item, we will do a full exploration.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Whoa, I can see that guy with a rock helmet over there.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
Oh, I'm getting...

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
No, no bomba, no bomba.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Hello.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Oh, that's what the king gave us.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
The two fit perfectly.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
He has a cool hat as well.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
What's your favorite item in this game?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
A stone door.

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
So that's what they meant by the source of the flow business.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
Well, this waterfall certainly is the source of Hyrule's water.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
According to King Gustav,

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
the final element lies somewhere behind these falls.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
We've done a long enough length.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
Let's paint that element.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Maybe my favorite item is the light

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
so I can fucking see in this cave.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Oh, I'm missing.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
I'm missing.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.000
The bat's just so skinny.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
Right, whoops.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
In both.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Um...

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Oh god, what's that doing?

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Oh, you can't destroy it.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
I'm on fire and I can't do anything.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
I guess it makes you vulnerable.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Oh, no more bomba.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
No more bombs.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
I can't take any more bombs.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Give me my gambaba.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Oh my god, why is he so aggressive?

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Get me up this wall.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Oh no, they're going to chase me up the wall.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
No, leave me alone.

42:38.000 --> 42:39.000
Leave me alone.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
I'm just a per innocent boy.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
I have no family.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Spare my life.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Hey, we found another wind crest.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Absolutely, right.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Let me think about that.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Stop!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.000
Oh my god, just a minute.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Get me in this cave right now.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
It's even worse than the cave.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Oh, that didn't even hurt him.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
What's there here?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Okay, just...

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
I swear if it shells.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Bro, we've got enough shells.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
I don't want a gambaba though.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
I don't want to send gambaba.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Oh, gambaba at the end.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
Up or down, up or down.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
I'm going up.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
I'm going up.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
I'm going up stairs.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
I'm going to enter.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
Jeez, the bat and fire station caverns.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
Think of the tourism industry.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Okay, I'll take you.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
What?

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
What?

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
I need out.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
I need out.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Jeez, let me.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
The race.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Wait.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I've just done a 360.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
No.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Right.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, I was going to say,

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
there's clearly something in the war

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
if it's giving me a ledge.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Some of those are ropes though.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
I'm not even interacting with that.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Anything in here?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Whoa, red.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Oh, yes, I've unlocked it.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Have a gun.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
It was like, what?

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
Oh, I'm rubbish at this game.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Shawnee's going to turn into a hoarder

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
of pyramid crafts all of a sudden.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Literally, there's so many shells.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
So this wasn't the way I was supposed to go.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
What is?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
I think I've done wrong then.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
What?

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Oh, there's a door there.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
That I didn't take.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.000
There is a fitting fitting.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
Okay, there we go.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
There we go.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Did it?

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Sorry, excuse me.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Pardon me, coming through.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
What have we here?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Some kind of vortex?

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
Well, we seem to have hit a dead end.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
What shall we do from here?

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Go in the vortex.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
Close talk.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
Close talk.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Am I still alive?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Link, what were you thinking, child?

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
You just reaped the world winds, as they say.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
We could be dead right now.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I must admit, it did the trick.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Are we?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Are we?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
In the lands above the clouds?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Then there must be something here

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
that can lead us to the fire element.

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Let's go find it.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
Ah, you surprised me.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Normally, surface dwellers can't walk on the clouds

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
like we do.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
My sister and I went to the Depokori Festival

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
on Hyrule Town,

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
and when we came back,

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
there were monsters everywhere.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
I bet if I could just fuse a Kinstone,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
but there are monsters about even...

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Do you think you could search for the Kinstone people?

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Oh, do you need like...

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Oh, no, we can do it.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Fly, Strony, fly!

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
My favorite dungeon.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Are you late this year?

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I think the air tops are maybe...

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Really?

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
I know the reward is like...

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
getting...

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Uh, yeah, we li-

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Did I not skip the clouds?

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Oh, hello.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Okay, but I don't have what you need.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
What about you?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Oh, this is bad, really bad.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Oh, hey, look at that.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I've never seen a surface dweller on the clouds.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
You must be pure of heart.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
Maybe one such as you would listen to the tale of my woe.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
See?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Right, I'm...

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
I just heard it from your sister.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
Thank you.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
That sounded really rude.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
I do have it.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
The controls are...

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Slightly different position.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Ooh, where did we unlock?

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Cause it's red.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Ooh, is it gonna be a coup?

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Oh, we were just there!

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
I was just there!

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
Rude.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Honestly.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Okay.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
Uh, let's go a little further right?

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Cause I can...

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Or no.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
What am I the bad dude?

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
Heh heh heh.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
What's down here?

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Wow!

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
We are short.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
I like how we get to dig the clouds.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
That's so cool.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Oh!

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Wait!

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
We can get Kenstone pieces in here?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Or was that, like, actually there?

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I think that may have actually been sitting there.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Okay.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Uh, let's fold down.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Cause we've not been in them here.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Wow!

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Hello!

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Did I have your missing piece?

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
I did!

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
All yours, buddy.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Mysterious cloud.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Uh...

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
A couple more to go, I guess?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
That's probably more shells, honestly.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Uh, we take a little left here.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
A little cheeky left.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Uh, what is over here?

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Is there anything of interest?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
No.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Let's jump down first to make sure we have,

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
adequately,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
the woman trouble.

48:42.000 --> 48:45.000
Oh god, they're going to knock me off the map.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Okay.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Two hit.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Oh, he just...

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Oh, we got a...

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Okay, okay, okay.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Second piece, second piece.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Yeah, let me get up, let me get up.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Thank you.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Skyfish.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Skyshark.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
Honestly.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Skiyark.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Great.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
What is this down here?

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
A little to the left.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
A little to the left.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Let's grab that wind gust.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Don't want to get in trouble.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Let me get up.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
Let me get up.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Uh, oh, there was something up there.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
Hmm.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
Can I do it?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Whoa, where are you?

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Did I need a shield from him?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Well, luckily...

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Okay.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
I'm sorry.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
What was that supposed to do?

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
A bow and arrow?

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
I think a bow and arrow.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Oh, suck him up.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Because he's an arrow thing.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
Gimme your cloud right now.

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
You're not so big without your cloud now, are you?

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Mario's gonna...

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Oh, sugar.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Right, we need to come back to this one.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Because we don't have the correct piece.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
Surely, I will not forget the location.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Surely.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Hope you'll...

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
Okay, uh, middle left is...

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Uh, tree...

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Middle left.

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
What?

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
What?

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
What?

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
No, chicken shells, but I'm so full.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Jar of boomerang will not...

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
What?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
That is my favorite mermaid waifu?

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I ain't even a mermaid.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Oh, good thing.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
Ah.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Oh, there's another one of those guys.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Wait, you perish.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Yeah, we're getting there with the minish.

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
We're on the last element,

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
and then I think everything goes to do the time.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Yeah, yeah.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Perish.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Oh.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Okay.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Is this it?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Okay, we now know...

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
it's middle left for whatever one is missing.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Oh, there's five?

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
Oh, them...

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
I don't know what one to do then.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
Oh, well, I don't mind if I do.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Oh.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.000
Am I gonna have to do a second lap?

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I feel like I'm gonna have to do a second lap

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
around this area.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
I don't know.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I can't remember your style.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
As soon as you said mermaid,

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
and I'm like,

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
I'm not a mermaid.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
And I'm like,

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
oh, wait a minute.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I was like,

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
oh, wait, hold on a minute.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Hold on a minute.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
I didn't write that part of my line.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Oh, I got two licks in.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
I'm the most.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
One each.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
You know, for an enemy,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
you sure as heck don't actually directly attack.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
I'm gonna get shoved off the map because of that.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Oh, I need to defeat him.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
No, I'm...

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Okay, I need like an eight-foot sword,

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
like an Elden Ring.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Or just do that and knock yourself out.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
Aren't sirens the evil mermaids?

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I mean, I guess.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
I guess you're lucky that I don't have to sing,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
or you'd be in such deep doo-doo.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
You're not in deep doo-doo.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Right, enough with the shells.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
We ain't go all the time at Gambo.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
Sure, drop this here.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
I won't say there's something here.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Just get me up.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Freaking go.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
There's a cheeky hole.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
What's up there?

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
I don't know.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
What's down here?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Oh, a fusion.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
I'll take it.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
I'll take it.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
You fit.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Perfect.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
I calculated.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
Calculate.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
Yes, yes, calculate.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
True, true, emoji gamer.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Okay, two more.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I have one golden piece.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I just need the other one.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
I can go back to the middle one that I missed.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Wow, we can't get up there.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
But we can get radio.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
There's not like a secret on the wall or anything.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Where are we going?

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Where are we going?

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Come on.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
Okay, we're now back on the other one.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
I need to go top left to get the last piece.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Which I'm going to do right now.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Top left.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Yes.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Baby, last piece.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Oh my God.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
I'm so smart.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Oh, there's something here.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
Hey, don't give me.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
You know what?

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Okay.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Okay.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
I should have gambled.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
I admit it.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
I should have kept gambling.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I apologize.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
I should have kept gambling.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
Okay.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
I think it was in here.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Literally the game's like, please gamble.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I'm like, I'm child.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
I shouldn't be doing it.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Right.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Did we?

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
I think it's back at the start.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
And the other one.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
There's a back at the start.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Question mark.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I don't know.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Serves you right for not gambling.

55:11.000 --> 55:15.000
Did you know that 100% of people that win big give up,

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
like right before,

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I can't remember what the meme format is,

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
but yeah, it's awful.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Please don't actually gamble.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
I'm actually getting a bit turned around now.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
I'm like 99%.

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
I already did this one today.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
So what's up here?

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
Okay.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
I grabbed that one.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
What was back down here?

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
I can't remember.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
90% of gambling addicts quit before they hit big.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Yeah, literally that's so terrible.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
That meme format is absolutely a reader.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I'd actually be really interested in doing a deep dive

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
into the gamble psychology

56:06.000 --> 56:11.000
because I struggle to comprehend it

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
because I just get really...

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
Right.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Am I going the wrong way again?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I think I might have.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Oh, I got red.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Okay, it is just random.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
I'm running in circles.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I know I'm trying to get back to the start.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
I don't know where the last podium is.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Any podium goers?

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I think it's back at the start.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
I think I just can go back now because I've got the piece.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Unless it was back there.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Wait, hold on.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Let me do a U-turn.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
I'm too busy yapping.

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
No, we did do it.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Right, go back up again.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Yeah, the last one's back at the start.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
Okay, okay, okay.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
No, no, Link, no.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
I'm starting to think you just like the gravity of falling.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
You can't go back to the start from here.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Always gambit till you're broke.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
No, this is terrible.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I think it's to the right there.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
Right, I just need to take our U-turn right and then we found it.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
This, this is it.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Surely.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Sure is it.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Oh, there it is.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I just need a drop down.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Wow.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Whoever said go right, time them out.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
No one said that.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
You don't have to say that anymore.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Oh, we did it, we did it, we did it.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Get me the heck out here.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Why gamble when you can give your money a mummy?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
No, well, you don't need to do that either.

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
What's more of a ways gamble or giving me money?

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
Choose your, choose your challenger.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
We did it, yeah.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
Fantastico, fantastico, let's go.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
And we got two redkenstone pieces of all that.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
Oh my god, look how pretty it is.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Oh, and we can get a freaking flight stolen.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Thank goodness.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Hey, we found another wincrease.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Now we have one more to travel to when we use the ocarina.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Hey, ocarina.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
Now, how do you build something like this on top of a clown?

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Maybe someone lives inside.

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
If so, perhaps you could ask for the element.

58:49.000 --> 58:52.000
I'm just checking if there's a hidden secret on the outside, but no.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
It's kinda...

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Okay, now the man's out of my way.

58:57.000 --> 58:58.000
Do you remember that portal?

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Do you remember that portal?

59:00.000 --> 59:05.000
Oh, if it's an old link, my quest to match kinstones has taken me all the way up here.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I'm not sure you've noticed yet, but we're on top of the clouds.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
The wind trebles here.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
They protect the path of the palace of winds where the wind element lies.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
Oh, it's you.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
I thought I'd never make it back here, but thanks to your kinstone, I did.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
If you're looking for something, go talk to the elderly lady on the fourth floor.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Okay, elderly lady, fourth floor.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Blue flower, white thorns.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
There's something like that, I can't remember.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Oh yeah, give me your pot.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Look, there's the old man.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
He's up in there, and there's something.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Oh, it's Link.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Thank you for your help over there.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
I've got something else here.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Take this.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.000
Huh?

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Did you double damage?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Did you double damage?

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Imagine if I let that gentleman slip away.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Why is everyone asking for the pieces I don't have?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
You know, feel well.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I don't have that piece.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
He just upgraded my bowl.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Hello?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Let me guess.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
You're going to ask for a piece I don't have?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Oh, you asked for the piece I actually do know.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Hold the button.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
A snake.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
It's all coming in my way.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Well done.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Hey, they set perfectly.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The wind tribe is very skilled at pieces.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
So skilled in fact.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
We have more of them than we can manage.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
We can't even store them.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I wish someone would take them.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
You wish someone would take them?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Say no more.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
No, I'm not doing anything in here at all.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Yeah, oh, thanks.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
She's slow.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I'll take that.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Don't mind if I do.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Thanks, hen.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I appreciate it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Yeah, your collection's a whale.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Oh, what's that?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You need someone to take away all your pieces?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Oh, you shouldn't.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Yeah, you shouldn't.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
What's going on?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Welcome, welcome.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Long, long ago and then the age before that.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I tried the brand and the place you call the wind ruins.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
With our magic,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
we moved our palace up into the skies.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
We are the wind tribe.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
We've been watching and we know all that is happening

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
on your surface world.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
We know a small boy collects elements

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
to lift the curse for a princess.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
We know of Vati and his evil acts.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
The winds tell us these things.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
The wind element that you seek lies deep

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
in the palace of winds above me.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
When the blade has been infused with four elements,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
sorry, forgetting my lines here,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
the way to the light force shall open.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
So it is told in the legend of the wind tribe.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Vati himself may already know this.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Surfaced well as they're not permitted

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
to enter our palace,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
but you, boy, are special.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
You may continue to the roof.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Can I fuse with you?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You're a cheeky granny, you are.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
You're cheeky cheeky granny.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
You got me a weekend stone to fuse.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
There's this device in the palace

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
that allows you to fly in the sky.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
When I get bigger,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I want to explore the palace and find it,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
but I'm too scared right now.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You just walked over me.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
That's rude.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And before someone complains

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
about being weighed down by Cherries.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Cherries for me to take.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Right here.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Oh, baby!

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Okay, full health.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Ready?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Ready?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
We're going to do this

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
and I'll make a tea,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
and then we'll do lots of exploring

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
to see if we can get all the hearts and stuff.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
One, irritation.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
We find our way to the very tops of the cloud,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
and then we have to go even higher

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
to find a floating palace.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I can't believe what a long way we've come.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And look how high we are.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Don't look down, blink,

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and watch your step.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
It's a long fall from here, ya bam.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Look, I'm trying my best, jeez.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Don't need to...

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Oh, I'm gonna need them.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I'm gonna need to...

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
There's so many enemies on this map.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Oh.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Oh, it made them fall.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Oh, that's not very nice.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Where'd they go?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Can I stop coming?

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
No!

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I didn't know you could do that!

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But the scallies...

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I just got pranked.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And 4k.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Alright, hold on.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
We need to do the boomerang.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
So we need to do the boomerang?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Is that it?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Am I going crazy?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
What do I need?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
A bow and arrow?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Am I like, banned arrows now?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Okay, okay.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Arrows, arrows.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It's fine, it's fine.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Guys, why are you sweating?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I was going,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
hmm, I missed the logic in this puzzle.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Oh, whoa.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I almost fell off the map

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
because I wasn't paying attention.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Eeps.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Eeps.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Okay, let's do a bow and arrow.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I need to go by with 3?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Why would you give me stones?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I can push, I have no idea.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Wow.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Music game, good.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Wow, please don't hurt me.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Please don't hurt me.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Whoa.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Okay, I've actually got a fright there.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I'm like, I just jumped in my chair.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Like, I knew it was going to happen,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
but I still got a fright nonetheless.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
What is going on?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Whoa.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
What am I to go?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I can't do that.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Where's the fire going?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Oh my God, I'm so skinny.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I'm actually so skinny,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I didn't get hit once, Lamal.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
There's a fluffy cloudflown here.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It looks awfully comfortable.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
I too would like to sleep on a cloud.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Should I?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I'm going to use the boomerang.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Oh.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Because it doesn't cost any ammo.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I jumped too.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Literally, give me a wee fray.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Oh, I'm supposed to be here.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Ew, what happens if I sat on it?

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Oh, I'm actually...

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Logic puzzle or I'm just...

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Am I going the wrong way?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Okay.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Use a bomb.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I'm about to blow this.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I would not have figured that out.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I'm going to be honest.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Oh, yum.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Ah.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Shadow Wizard money game.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
We look at these spills.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Well, I lost that fight anyway.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Oh.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
I wondered that.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
We unlocked the figurines

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
before we actually went against them.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
This is the shit.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
This is the shit.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Shadow Wizard money game.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Oh, I'll get wrecked.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Oh, I'll get wrecked.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Oh, bless I am. You've got Rockscape. Great. Jump with the greatness of Ease. Hold the button and jump faster.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Right. Oh my god. Oh, I'm so good. I'm actually so good.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
This game. Well, we can officially fully explore the map now. We'll do.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Gamma. I saw that.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I'm actually so good. You have this figure. You must be a fan of the family.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Oh my god. I love being able to jump.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Okay.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I just can't roll up them.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I cast and bear her growth.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I'm still in mulch. I'm still addicted to mulch.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Whoa. Game shields up.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I can't.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:59.000
There's a strong gale blowing here. Try not to get swept away and hold on to your hat. You're my hat.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Am I supposed to get blown away? I think I'm supposed to jump.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I am supposed to jump. Whoa.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I was almost gone there. I'm not going to lie. We almost didn't make that jump there.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Oh.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:27.000
What? Okay. We need to do the magic staff thing.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Okay. Okay. We're getting there. We're getting there.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Zelda. Let's go. That panel. I think if we stomped on it hard enough, it might flip over.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Yeah. We're still missing two bottles. No. I ain't doing it.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The money's good, but I ain't doing it.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I ain't missing it.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I don't actually remember how difficult the boss is up ahead.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000
There is a possibility we have to go...

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:11.000
We have to go back. We have to go deeper.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Because we are missing out on a lot of exploratory goodies.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Oh my... Bruh, who's...

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
How skinny you can come?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Ah, can I do it in time? No, by a freaking bore here.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
No, Gami. Stop it. Gami, that's mean.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Okay. It looks like I need to jump between two.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Yes. After this area, we'll do exploring.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
We'll try and get full hearts. We'll go back to all those master tutor people as well.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Professional speedrunner confirmed, actually, though.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Witch dungeon. This is for the fourth element, the wind element. We're in the sky temple.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I might want to activate my boots first.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Oh, I don't like this. I don't like this.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I'm just going to take the HP damage because...

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Yeah, I don't want to have to do this.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Oh, and the fucking boots respawned.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Well, I'm not mad with Spain.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, and the respawn.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.000
One thing I could absolutely decimate about this game.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Okay, and then straight down.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Jeez, get me over there.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I tried to put up my uno collab.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Schedule, and it kept rejecting it for some reason.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I think me, Mercy, and me are just too powerful.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I kept saying error when I put it up.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Sorry about the uno collab not being up, but there is an uno collab.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Oh, as far as I'm aware, there's an uno collab.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Silly me. Silly me. I'm being a silly sausage.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
But I'll try and get it up.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Why did you do that?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I'll try and get it up after the stream.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Oh, killing me.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Tiny time. Tiny time.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Tiny time.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Oh, no. Oh, no, this can't be.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Is this a logic puzzle? Well, I can only push it.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Oh, shit.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Like this.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Oh, that's a star.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
A bluntly half as well.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I'm making it worse.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I'm making it worse.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
I'm making it worse.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000
I'm making it worse.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Oh, no way I did it.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Oh, no way I did it.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Oh, my God. I don't know how I did that.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I'll take it.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I think this dungeon

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.000
is actually pretty big.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Can't believe you let me cook.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Can I jump over this?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Can I jump over this?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.000
No.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Oh.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I never see it until it's really obvious.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I got it lucky.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Wait, no.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Did not already have access to this area?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Did not already have access to this area?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I'm losing it.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
But I just did that.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Oh, I have a key to get here.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Yeah. When Twilight Princess, I've never played another Zelda game.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
This is the issue. The only reason I'm doing malely good on this one

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000
is because I actually played it before.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
But focusing, there's another...

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.000
a new 2D Zelda out which I'm actually super interested in.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I need to watch the trailer.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But I think we might be playing Baltoi.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Baltoi? Baltoi.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Baltoi next week.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
That's lovely, the piece that I've been needing.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I need to do what now?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Okay, I just send it.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.000
What?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Thank you, Imperial Monarch. You're work right now?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Oh, I'm doing lawn work. Oh my god.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Someone commented under the video, like the audio.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000
You should... oh, I'm at work right now.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
So I can't listen. And I always so tend to send back.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
No, do it. Get hard at work.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I can't be doing this. People are getting fucking trouble for this shit, honestly.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
But I was feeling it yesterday.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You guys were letting me talk about whatever my interests are in that.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.000
So my brain was like, yeah, let's get rid of this.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
How did I hurt myself in

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
trying to hurt the enemy?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Please get us in trouble. No, like, literally, I was like, no, this is...

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I had to hold myself back. I don't know if you guys do this,

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:39.000
but I type out responses on Twitter and stuff, and then I delete it

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
because I'm like, no, you idiot. That's not a good idea.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Don't do that. That's so bad of me.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Hey, it is from...

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Can I even get him? Yeah, I was going to say, can I even get him

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.000
without perishing? One way or another, he's going to get me.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It wouldn't mind some hearts. I'm starting to get a bit low.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Finally finished working, mummy. Thank you for the... yeah!

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
You're welcome!

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Less than 3,000. Thank you so much.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Broly legend, thank you. Sorry.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.000
I'm struggling. Just, just, just...

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:27.000
I'm struggling to read. I can't believe it. I can't believe my inability to read

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
is coming back to me. Oh, there's a heart! There's a heart! There's a heart!

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Wait, this is not where I'm supposed to go?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Where am I supposed to go?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Oh, I can just go for it.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Because I have flight now. Can I jump for this one?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
No, you cannot! Please, if you ever thought that you could

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
perhaps jump for that one, please don't jump for that one.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Don't be like me and think you can make it. You cannot make that jump.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Eh...

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
That's what office toilets are for.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
That's terrible!

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Right into... right in his arms. All of my guests, you're one too.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Please, game you... this game...

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
What the fuck is that?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Armor? Okay.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I need to buy a large quiver right now.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Because if... ow!

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Bro, this game needs to start dropping hearts. Please do not make me go all the way back to the start. I'll cry.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Bruh.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I need focus. I actually need to focus! What's going on?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:55.000
I need to focus.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Yeah, yeah, get fucked.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
What is going on?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.000
How much freaking arrow I put in you?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Oh, I'm actually gonna die. What happens if you die in Legend of Zelda?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Oh my god, the teleport's right there, I think.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
This is the first teleport.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Okay.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Let me get up, let me get up.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Oh! What the...

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Wait, so I put a billion arrows? No, this isn't the teleport out!

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Sugar, I thought this was the teleport here.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I am so low, but I don't want to go all the way back.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Holy crap, I just need to not mess it up. Don't mess...

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Don't mess it up, it's fine. Don't mess it up though. Don't mess it up!

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Can someone drop me a heart? Like, seriously?

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
No, I couldn't have done that worse if I tried!

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
If I tried, if I tried. If I tried.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Literally, the game has put me on life support.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:11.000
Oh, am I actually gonna die? I really don't want to go back though!

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Oh, please have a heart in this.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Can I keep leaving the room and then coming back?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Oh wait, I need a pot, sorry.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Hold on, is this gonna drop a heart if I do this?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
It's dropping rupees, so if it's respawn and there's a chance it'll give me a heart.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Hold on, hold on!

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Bear with me, bear with me, Aces in the room, bear with me.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Oh, come on!

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Give us a chance for a heart! Why is this game so

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
allergic to dropping hearts from pots?

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Literally, I'm just getting my bank account up right now.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000
A freaking shell! I don't need a shell!

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I actually am starting to wonder if they even coded

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
any hearts to drop in these pots.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.000
Yeah, thanks for the five rupees. That is useless for me right now.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Do you have fairies? Oh, I do have fairies!

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Alright, I'll use one fairy.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
That will have to do.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
There is a possibility.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000
We don't do this, you know that?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.000
We might have to go back and get more.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Thank you for your...

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Yeah, you're more than welcome.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Ah!

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Of course a heart drops when I've dunked the fairy.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Ah!

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Oh, Justin no more.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Yeah? Okay, well...

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Shadow Wizard? I'm gonna get it.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Don't do that again. Jesus, I was cheating.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Oh, they're giving these kinsome pieces though, because I kinda need to trade.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
They're gonna lie.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Don't fight me, bro.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Give me a heart! Give me a heart! Don't be shy! Give me a heart!

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Can I whack him when I'm around?

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I'm just going for it.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I'm just going for it. We are getting so low health.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000
We are getting so low health!

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Oh my god. That for a key?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Something has to give.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Something has to give.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Wait, can I just permanently get rid of this guy?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Fuck you!

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Did they always drop fairies?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000
New Zelda lore?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Did they always drop fairies when you whack them? Or was that just like really good

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
rear drop?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Get in my bowl! Get in the jar!

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
What? No!

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000
No way!

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Oh my god, we got the big key, but we still don't have the teleport.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.000
We didn't drop fairies! Fuckin' get hit ya! Bam!

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Give me that right now. Right, we've got two fairies.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Oh my god, learning!

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Ronnie talking to Reflings. I just called you guys Ronnie there.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Ronnie and Reflings together becomes Ronnie!

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and all the hearts are here. Oh god.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but I'm no good with heights.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Hold on, I think I see something down there.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I guess that means we have to take the plunge after all.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Oh shi...

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I've got my wee tiny shield. You be nice to...

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I looked the wrong way! No! I'm at full health! Oh my god, sorry.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000
I'm having a stroke. Link keeps looking so. I don't know why.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.000
I don't know why.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
How big is his freakin' sweat?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Ah!

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Oh, I need my shield.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Why is it he can push me off the map?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
But when I go to push him off the map, that's no possible.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And then he says I'm a wane. I've literally...

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Is that gonna work?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.000
What am I doing? I'm having a stroke but not the good kind!

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Oh!

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I'm having a stroke but not the good kind!

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Oh my god!

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Right, I'm just gonna keep coming back and forth.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I was getting absolutely rolled. That is embarrassing how bad that went.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I need to keep coming back to respawn the hearts. I'm so sorry.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Mapologies, mapologies.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Yeah, we're definitely

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
exploring to get the rest of the hearts. Because if I'm making and the rest of the

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
jars, if I'm making mistakes like that,

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
we ain't gonna be making it through anything. This is supposed to be

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
a game for children question mark? Absolutely not.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Because that is insane. Right, let's go.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Is there like 10 Pokemon sound effects

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
in one? What do you mean?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
How much further do we have to go? This place goes on forever. There's no point in complaining

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
about it. We must press on more. After all, how much more could there be? Come on Link, let's go.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I like how the game acknowledges this area is so vast and

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
ridiculous. Okay, hearts.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Oh, no.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I do not consent.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Okay, hug someone else.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Okay, up the stairs.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
What's up here? Slames.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Okay, let's suck these guys off.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Aw, I could have got a double kill there.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Um...

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Mom.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Oh, that's what I didn't want.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I assume I need to do that.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Well, maybe if you weren't so selfish

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
and now I'm gonna have to restart the room and do that

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
all over again. I should have been new. Oh, I kept them all

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
perished. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Don't be nervous. Don't be shy. Is anyone online

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
right now that I need to shout out from the Allure?

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Any of the Allures online?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Or what's the situation? Oh, I can jump over these.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I was like, aw, I can't do anything about that.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Wee! Oh, just

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
no more. I got a kill. Sheeby and Azura

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
in 30. Oh my god, that's right. They're playing

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
um, they're playing Jelly Bean game.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Uh, if anyone wants to join them, you can.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Oh, sorry, I'm to jump into it. My apologies. Yes, I'm to jump

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.000
into it. Yes, I knew that. Okay, well, I completely missed a lot.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Wee!

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Uh, yes, they are going to load up a lobby first

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and give each other, get each other in the lobby

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
and then they're going to reveal the code so you can

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Jelly Bean snipe, uh, Sheeby and Azura.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Yeah, okay. Jelly Bean game!

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Uh, this is my problem.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I don't know if they just continually respawn.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
It's very plausible that they do.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Can I not? Okay, I was going to say, can I not do that?

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Uh, no. You're in

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
my way. Please don't do that again.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Uh,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
I've just done a 360.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Ow, where?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Um, I think I need to jump down

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
in the middle here. You know that? You know that? I'm getting a memory.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I'm getting a memory! Oh, I love Childhood Me.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000
You're so smart. Thank you for coming. We're literally saving this run

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
right now. Childhood Me, I'm not even joking.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
We got a...

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Yeah, I'll take that heart, please.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Great. So we go up here again.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Core memory found. Literally accessing

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
core memory. Right, and then...

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Oh, you lose health so quick in this game.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Hold on a minute. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let me try again.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Let me try again.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
That's it. Let him get up. Let him get up.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:45.000
If it's gonna be safer going all the way around, I will go all the way around

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
because, bruh, let him get up.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Let me redo. Give me a shot. As if this is safer.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I think I actually is, though.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:01.000
Lulululu...

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Lulululu...

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Lulululu...

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Okay.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Why am I so premature

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.000
with my fricking actions?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Man...

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
I could have sworn.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Okay, let's try that again. Let him get...let me get up. Let me go.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
There! As everyone is my witness, I am on it.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Right, so what's up here? Okay, it is definitely

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
a lot faster just to go the other way. I'm not gonna lie.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Oh, that's a jump down on water.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.000
We have an ability to jump down that way if we still desire.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
So then water's over here.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Yeah.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Shadow Wizard money. Oh, I can't do it.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I'm gonna need a cup of tea and I'm gonna...

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
I'm gonna need a fricking cup of tea.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I'm nuking this...I'm nuking this place into oblivion.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Yeah, that's what you get.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Do I even have anything that does damage?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Put me on fire, will you? Yeah, bam!

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Didn't even insult me like that. Right, what we got? What we got? What's the...

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000
A dungeon map? Well, I didn't even need it.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Thanks anyway.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Yeah, you're no grabbing me.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000
You're no grabbing me. Good luck.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
No, no! Get me up the stairs.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Oh, why so many?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
A child's game, by the way.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Right, fuck it, we're jumping over here.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I don't know why we're jumping over here, but we're just going for it.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.000
We're sending it. Oh, okay, I'll take that.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
You now have three. Just collect one more and we'll get another unlock.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
We've got a city to burn. Scottish Rage Charging. No, no, I'm calm.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
I'm calm, I'm calm. Oh, I have to go down.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Okay, I'll go down.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
See, you're not the only one that can jump your bams, honestly.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Right, we went left, so now we have to go right.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
I don't even know where we are.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I don't even know where we are.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
A freaking rock.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
At least I got a kingstone piece. Where the heck are we?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Oh, fuck, fucks sake!

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
We have fucking offerty.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
What the fuck do I need to go? Right, not that way.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
We'll go all the way back.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
As if you guys respawn!

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Yeah, we're definitely

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
exploring. I'm getting like full health.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
No, no, not the fire though, not the fire though. As long as I don't get the fire,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
because as soon as you get given the fire, right.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You perish. Alright, I know what to do.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Come on.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Get in, get me in.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh my god, how much health do you have?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Ay, yay, yay!

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Followed me at the convention like...

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Jeez, I'm getting absolutely wrecked.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000
This is probably the hardest...

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.000
This has to be the hardest part of the game.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Bro, this is getting outrageous.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Oh, please don't run off the map, Link.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I know your arse is on fire, but please...

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
For me, for me, Link. For me, Linky-Poo.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Whatever the heck is this wizard?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
That's the spells.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Oh my god, right.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
There's a bomb that has to go here, I'm pretty sure.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
This is the worst. Literally, I have to admit, like, all of a sudden, this is, like, tedious.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
No game developer wants your game to be...

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Huh?

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Am I not?

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Oh, I have to...

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Easy.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Easy, I'm just...

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Wow, I'm so skinny.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Actually so skinny, so I had to hold my breath for that when I was like...

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I had to suck in, I had to go...

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Oh, there's the door! We're, like, right at the boss fight!

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I don't think I'm...

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
It doesn't matter.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Okay, we're right at the boss fight.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
We can do it! We're so close, replay! We're so freaking close!

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Right, so I don't need to do anything here.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
What do I need to do then?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Oh!

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
See you, jumping on my head.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hug someone else. Where's my hug?

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Huh?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I think I got another.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
What is it?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I need to go back already.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Wait, what's going on over here then?

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Hold on, I've missed something. I've missed a...

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I've missed a vital clue. What have I missed?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
A boomerang? Can boomerang even go over?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Hello?

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Hit the switch with a bomb.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
As if that was the move!

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000
That wasn't even on the same pixel tail, like...

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000
That wasn't even on the same tail! How is that supposed to figure that out?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Oh my god, they're paling me with money as a sorry.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I need to drop down?

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Am I going crazy?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
I have to go up

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
in order to go down, but only up and a little to the left.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Okay...

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Up and a little to the left, so there's something to the...that can fall down up here.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.000
But I need to fall down on the left side.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I come friend, I come friend!

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I'm learning, going!

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I need to fall here.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Oh!

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I'm so fucking smart! And this game is just proving how smart I am.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Alright, stop charging bro. I can't hit you if you're charging me.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
I can't hit you if you're charging me and I'm not full health.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Oh! Bro! You're not even in the same tail as me!

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Glowy.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I'm going to start dropping bombs.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And the Legend of Zelda. The hit video game.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Legend of Zelda.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Well, I didn't...

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Can I just shoot?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Link, sorry.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Alright, how do I...

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Just jump?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Oh! How am I supposed to make a mini jump?

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:13.000
A mini jump.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Okay, we did it, we did it.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Shadow Wizard minigame. We look.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Oh, I fucked that one up, didn't I?

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Yes, I fucked that one up.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
That was fine, I'll reset when we go up.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:37.000
I think this is the ball?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I think?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Please be easier. Oh my god, we're still going?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Give it a break!

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Alright, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I've got one fairy to my aid.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
I just need to not mess this up.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Let's not mess this up. We should watch you play a puzzle game.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000
It just ends up with me swearing.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Okay, okay. I'm already seeing something that I need to.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Some. Okay.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Phase 1 already complete, question mark?

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Phase 1 complete, question mark. Please let me on.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Do I need to get on? I don't know. Is that supposed to jump on that?

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I don't know. Nope.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I'm not...

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
What do you want from me?

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
What do you want from me? What do you want from me? Do you want me to get on you? I don't know. Oh, okay.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
You've just killed me. I just refused to let me on you.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Maybe I was supposed to jump on you? How is I supposed to know that?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:01.000
How is I supposed to know that?

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
It's fine. I didn't need the HP.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
It's fine. I didn't need the HP.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It's fine. I didn't need the HP.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000
So the blue guy is not friendly.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Go on and fucking spam it!

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
I didn't do it. Oh, I didn't do it.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Hold on. Hold on. I'm fucking dodging me. I'm fucking dodging.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Wait, hold on. I don't want him to get me.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Okay, here we go. Now jump on his back.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Jump on blue. Okay, I'm on blue.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You like that? You like that? You see that?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Power and skill. Jump! Okay, it's fine. It's fine. I've got a fairy.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.000
I've got a fairy. I've got a fairy.

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Why the heck are there so many? I don't even remember.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
You need to jump. Please jump. Oh my god, please. Please.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Please. Please! Why is he doing backflips?

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Fuck it!

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
No! The HP can't take anymore!

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I might lose this. I'm not going to lie. I'm actually released.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I'm not confident. I'm not confident.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
But that's not going to stop me. That's not going to stop me. Jump on his back.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Okay, completely miss his back. It's fine. Okay, jump on his back.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Okay, okay. Easy. Easy. Easy.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Easy. Easy. Take it. No! Don't jump! Why would it not be

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000
sequenced to his freaking back? Why would you do that?

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Why would you do that? Get... Oh, I'm going to need calling a fairy.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Get on his back right now. Jeez, love.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Right, bro. If the game doesn't put me on his back, what do you actually want me to do?

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
What do you want me...

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
We ain't going to do it. I think I'm actually going to die here. Oh my god.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Stop! He keeps, like, purposely going away.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Oh, get to fuck. Oh my god, did we do it?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Oh, thanks again for dropping me. No, it's fine.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I didn't want to win. It's fine.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Child's game, by the way. Child's game, by the way!

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And you just nuked my freaking allies.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Ooh, it actually doesn't really seem

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
to matter what... Oh my god, we did it.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Don't ever make me do that again. Why was that so hard?

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
My hands were sweating. My hands are literally sweating

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
so much right now. Why was that so hard?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Oh. Oh, it's a snail.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000
That's wind?

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Is that wind? Why would the wind look like that? Shouldn't it not be, like,

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
a cloud or, like, three little wings? You got the wind element!

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
The wind carries the seeds of flowers scattering life across the lands.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
That's called wind dispersal on seeds. The wind element is the embodiment

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000
of that power. Yeah, me, though!

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Okay, we now have even more health, which I will take.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Get me out here. Get me out.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.000
At last, we've got all four elements. Let's go

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000
revive the sacred blade. Now this is where everything goes to

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Judy Kaka. Bruh, I need a victory

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
cup of tea after that. I'm not even kidding. I need a victory cup of tea.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Hello, Elder. Now would you like to fuse?

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Poster check.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Currently a shrimp, the way I like it.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000
A chest in the graveyard?

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Yeah, yeah. I'll take it. I'll take it.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Oh, they fit perfectly. Right. There's a tornado at the top of the winds.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Receive the blade. I already did. I thought her dialogue was going to change, actually.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Okay, I'll get ready. No, no, no.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Kaka. Oh, we can trade with you as well. You want green.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
We destroyed like a billion monsters that need green. Or that drop green, sorry.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Yes, I am going

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:25.000
to basically do all the side stuff. Like,

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
no. We'll play gacha. How about that? We'll play gacha

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.000
for a bit.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
You guys have so much money. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I'm going to upgrade our quiver size, not to be confused

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
with you quivering last night to

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
my audio. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here all week. That's not even funny.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Oh. Well, when I said it wasn't funny, you didn't have to actually

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
announce that it wasn't funny. Okay.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Mate, when I explore before, yes, I absolutely will.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Where do we start?

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Like, where do we start? Tomato, tomato.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
There's still a few things you need but to fill store, but no, everything. Yes. Okay, the

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000
town hasn't gone to Shisa yet. So, I'm actually

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
right. We have the cape.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
How the fuck do you get in here?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I don't know how I get that. But yes,

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
there is like, all the

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
weasels floating about on itself. Do everything you've done before you completely

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000
hit the sword because this is the point of no return.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.000
I already did him and he gave me a heart, I'm pretty sure.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
The door's shut. We can't open it from the side.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Why can't he open it from any other side either? Alright, let me upgrade our quiver size.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Oh, the quiver. Yes, that.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Kin stone the door, most likely. You are a big

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000
gender. There's a way you get in that house.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Right. Oh, are we laundry?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Hi, Link. If you have an empty ball, I can put one of my charms

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
inside. Oh, that's cute.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Oh, something red, so it's something good.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.000
You have to get every figure in

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
the gacha. What does a butterfly do?

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.000
What does a butterfly do?

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
What does a butterfly do?

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I don't know. Oh, she's got to be laundry.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Oh, wait, you're that ghost. I met your brother.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Don't worry, I'm already looking for another job.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Oh.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:57.000
I think we can also learn a new technique

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:01.000
because we've got the cape now. Imagine watching like, I don't know

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
how old Link is lore-wise, but imagine watching like a 12 year old jump

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
of it with a cape. You have the cape. You have acquired a new skill.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000
I'm ready to train you. Yes, I would like to train, please. Now I will teach you how to take three.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
The down thrust. First, equip the cape. Second, equip the sword.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Jump, and then at your jump's peak, thingy. Yes, I understand.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
You see it, do you not? What does it do? I must possess you.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Oh, no.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Oh, I like that.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Wait. Hold on a minute.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Am I not AB?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Okay, there we go. Sorry, sorry to be a little second there.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
My apologies, my apologies. Please do not look at me in the eyes. I'm

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.000
rather embarrassed with that move. Joy butterfly's appear.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Catch a joy, increase Link's speed while digging, swimming, or shooting. Oh, okay.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
There's nothing more I can teach you. Now you must train yourself. Okay, we can now go to the other

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
masters to get trained up. Right, we'll do some gachapon,

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000
since we actually need to do it in order to get full

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000
health. Are you guys feeling lucky?

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Oh, hello. Yeah, trade. I really

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
wish you could do it all in one go, and before we get like another one that we already have.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Gambit time.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Down throws. Big octa rock.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Octa rock is such a good ASMR trigger word.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Octa rock, octa rock, octa rock. I'll be saying that in my next

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000
ASMR video. Octa rock.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Gambit time. What are we going to get?

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000
What are we going to get? We're going to get Percy.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Which I didn't actually solve his problem. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have access

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
to his house or something.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000
If you put extra in it increases your odds of not getting a duplicate. I don't want

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:05.000
to burn through it too much. Although

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.000
we do seem to be getting like tons of stuff anyway.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Strony calling you a good octa rock ASMR win. Oh no, I never looked.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry, I didn't see what we just unlocked there.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I like your outfit, Strony. Thanks. I didn't model

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000
it myself. I had no say.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
But I like the bikini.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
With the tape kind of thing. Okay, we got rope.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Not to be confused with Chibi.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
T minus seven minutes until your beloved milfs are live together.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Playing the most predictable game of all.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Jelly bean game.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:53.000
I'm actually a big fan of color combinations. I'm drawing you right now. Oh yeah?

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000
You like my green? My vert? Is this in French or vert?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:01.000
It's vert. 91% probability.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Look, 90% is not really high. Anything above 50% is like a one and two.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Although then again, you guys did see my luck.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
The third time I freaking got it. Yeah, you better buy that

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:17.000
freaking figurine. At least you get money if you pull up the same thing again.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:21.000
And what happened?

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Exactly.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
I can't. Oh!

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
The great dragonfly.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Dragonfly Vechiver? I'm actually

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
kind of down. Dragonfly Vechiver.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000
How would she look?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Would she have a toggle to open up her wings?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I mean, I like that. Dragonfly Vechiver.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I don't think I've heard of a dragonfly Vechiver. Oh, the forest bakori.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Very elegant and ladylike. Would a dragonfly

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
be a milf? Wait a minute!

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
The dragonfly would be a milf because if you didn't know, dragonflies are the most successful

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000
predator.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Oh my god, I need someone who's in a shot or corner to play her.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Oh, that would be outrageous.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Yeah, that's

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
fucked. Yeah, that'd be outrageous. But that's funny as fuck.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.000
And before I even put, oh, I'm triggered. Oh, go fuck off me.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I'm just leaving about. I've actually been getting in a model in Wings and 3D. Dragonfly

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Vechiver. Munker.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Hire me, I'll do it, I'll do it.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
A to A, geez, the probability going down.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.000
As long as it's not a blight. A little too far. Oh, all right. Okay, okay.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000
My bad. Speaking of dragonfly.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
So he gives me five rupees every time I have a duplicate, which I should be the goose.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Prey and Mantis Vechiver.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000
They don't have, I don't like Prey and Mantis.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Not far enough.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Oh, it's Mama's Cafe. This is the best place

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
in Tentorite. She can also pick up some good tips. I actually love this

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
little cute save mission thing. It's actually really sweet. I know it's not

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
like, sweet, sweet, but.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
87%

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Not far enough.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:41.000
For anyone who is lurking and is like,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000
what on earth are you doing? We have finally unlocked all the items

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000
in the Legend of Zelda Minish Cap and we are currently just doing all the side missions

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
because if we progress the story any further, basically

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000
everything goes to Judi Kaka and it's not very

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
nice section of the game and the game unfortunately

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.000
is one of those games that reverts back every time you load up the same save.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
So the town will not be restored and

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:13.000
you'll constantly have the ability to do the boss fight type thing.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And I'd rather have it fun time.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
The Wind Tribe. God, this is so like 9.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I wonder how long development took on this game. I feel like a lot of love went into it.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.000
You know, a lot of love, a lot of hard work tears.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I never heard anything bad about the development of Game Boy games, to be honest.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
But then again, I guess back then you never really ask those kind of questions.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Like, oh, is, you know,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
how was development? How is this? How is that? Like it was all insider thingy.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
But now like development teams in that are being so open and honest

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
and like saying like this is what's happening, this is what we're doing next, the type thing.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
It came, it took Nintendo two years to come up with this beautiful game.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.000
That's fantastic. It really is

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
a beautiful game. Really, really.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I love it.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.000
They're paying you rupees for

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000
JPEGs, honestly. I think this came out. Pina

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Hyrule's Fruit Vendor. She hates vegetables. She won't even sell

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
tomatoes even though they technically are fruits. Freak!

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Oh my god, Nintendo!

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Steady on, some folk just dinny like certain palettes. You know, everyone's tongues a wee bit different.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Oh my god, that is a Nintendo.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Well, literally, they're

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
brutal. They like their fresh veggies.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Mayor Hagen, the mayor of the town of Hyrule, he's a big collector of odd mass.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
He's built a shelter in his garden just in case monsters attack Hyrule.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000
He knew. Is he a body?

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
She a fur diver. Every time I hear that I am

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Jingle, I'm the last one trailing off forever.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Meeps.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Nintendo went crazy for that one. Hagen Love, you liked that the mayor

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:17.000
of the town does nothing? Oh, and Eni and Meenie,

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000
the high-reliant vegetable growing in their fields are exquisitely delicious.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Apparently, Brocco sells some of their crops.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
They've got like little lore for all the townsfolk. Oh come on, give me a game

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
where it's about restoring a town, please. I'd love it. I'd go absolutely.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Oh, there's this game that's coming out that's called like...

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
It's like a hotel game. You run it.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Oh, Stockwell and his wee pup. Oh my god, he's called

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Stockwell because he's well-stocked.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
There's this hotel coming out, but it's like

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.000
you're playing Vampire or something.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
And I don't know if it's in Early Access right now

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000
or they're about to do Early Access.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Sheebie is live. Is there a...

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Ezlo has Link, a young boy on a quest with Ezlo to restore the four

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000
swords with the sword's power he hopes to remove the curse of Princess Zelda.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Join Sheebie and Ezra live on Fall Games.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Yes, if you want to play with Sheepsters and Ezra on Fall Guys,

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.000
you can do that right now. I kid you not, they are doing it right now.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
As long as you don't mess up tea.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Yes, we are literally just playing

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Zelda and finishing the main quest

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
and all that today. I don't know how long it's going to take. I thought it was only

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:49.000
going to take four hours, but considering we're at the two hour mark

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.000
and I've made no progress, um, yeah.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
It's fine. It's fine. This might be a little bit of an

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
endurance stream. Dr. Le, a gruff talking academic type who says

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:05.000
he's studying the PCORI. He doesn't seem to be aware that they're actually living in his own house.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Aw. If you're looking for an older RPG

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.000
that has rebuilding, look into... look at Dark...

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.000
look at Dark Cloud or Dark Chronicle. Oh, I love like the repair

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.000
ability in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed 2.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.000
You get to like repair either Monty Regione

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000
or Rigatoni, whatever you want to call it.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Scissorblades, that's actually a pretty good name for them. Or you get to repair like

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Roma and I really like that aspect of like fixing it up and like the environment

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000
changes as you fix stuff up and like you go on quest to do it.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I would absolutely love to develop some kind of game around that.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000
I've not met you yet.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.000
A great butterfly... oh no, in the Minish Woods.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I have met you.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Oh, I didn't realize the fairies were different types.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Like a dragonfly, a butterfly. So what's the... is it the blue one I've not

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:09.000
met yet? No progress blasts through that part of the game.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I mean, we got the last elemental, that's all we need.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Past that coded...

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Bro just said Rigatoni. Oh, sugar, that was a joy butterfly.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000
I probably could have read that, honestly, but...

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:29.000
We're trying to get through it. What's our percentage now?

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
75%, ooh. It's getting low.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.000
How low can you go? How low can you go?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Not exactly retro, but Bastion has a little bit of that and it's a good game.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000
I haven't played Bastion.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000
I don't... the only Bastion I've played is...

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Shoulda picked Mercy. Shoulda picked any kind of support.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
We ended up losing. All your fault, your tears are what I

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:01.000
live for.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Leaver appears in Wild Runes real full. These baddies

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.000
are really underground. You never know where they might pop up. Keep your shield raised and ready.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Your race will win, Stan. I wanna be Winston.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Uh...

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Lucky 2. Lucky 2 appears in the sky.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
I can't move, but they throw lightning bolts, steal their clothes with the gust star.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Oh, like how it actually gives you a base on how it flew.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Oh, Monkers. Monkers, I've got DMs in the discord. What does it mean?

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Um...

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Oh, okay, it's just one of the girls requesting something.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000
That's fine.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000
And Shibi might be cooking up something that I wholeheartedly support.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000
So I might need to get her a few assets for that, which is perfectly fine.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000
My apologies, a little bit distracted.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I can't believe it.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Shibi, unbelievably, came up with a concept that I

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:25.000
actually was considering.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
But it wasn't possible for me to do it

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
because of timing issues, I didn't have enough time to pursue such a project.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000
However, Shibi just came out with it and I was like...

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000
I've not told her that I actually had an interest in that,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
but I will 100% support it if she's interested in it. I'm not really sure how to go about it though,

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:49.000
because it's a bit hot to track down.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
But yes, we'll see. We'll see how it goes.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.000
You just killed him, I did.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Please read it out loud. No, I can!

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Don't get me wrong, I'm a blabbermouth. I can hardly hide anything that I'm interested in.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000
But that is not a project that a

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000
beetle appears in various areas.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
It is not for me to spill beans about.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I spill many beans, and I flick many.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
But that's not for me.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Probably 50% and then we'll take a break, I'll go get a honey tea because my wee voice box is already...

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Oh, Nairu!

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Nairu, she's looking for a house in Hyrule to move into. She's a descendant from a line of oracles

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000
of the land of Labriana. I'm going to say that's probably a reference to another

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Zeldor game that I've not played.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Yes, probability 50% and then we'll have a quick break. Beans and tea

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
all over. Oh, okay.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Vacuum pumped beans, no thank.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Do you have anything cooking which not even the girls know about?

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Oh, I've already heard that one. Um, that the girls don't know about?

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
I have monthly events.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I did post the old monthly events, but some of them are outdated

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000
and can no longer be utilized. Oh no, our probability dropped.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000
We'll have to get two in a row that we've had.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So, in July

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.000
is

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Minecraft server with the girls.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.000
The video game comes out as long as we don't hit any issues.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Aw, peaceful Hyrule.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I love that I just got back and you're talking about our flicking beans.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Oh no, I'm not. Broly legend. I'm talking about beans on toast.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Cause I'm British.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Thank you for the tip of the super chat. I'll take it.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Is the Minecraft server going to have mods or be vanilla?

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000
I think Emmy might want it to have mods. I always like vanilla, but

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:13.000
it's up to her.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I guess it's up to her. Whatever she wants to do.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Shaders are instance based, so she puts shaders on.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I don't have to see it. 68% on probability.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:29.000
We're getting there. We're getting lower.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
And after yesterday, I thought Stranny wasn't vanilla. I'm not that bad.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I didn't think it was that bad.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
What was that?

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Just...

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000
When does the Veil or Game come out and where can I purchase it?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000
It is free to play. It will come out on itch.io and you will know about it.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Ah, sugar! We're really starting to hit the

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:01.000
repeats.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Since you said you wanted vanilla Minecraft.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Azura's Dona Thon is the event

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000
for August, although I am going to try and ask

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.000
if a VTuber that does game shows will host a

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:21.000
game show for us. I just need to get all the assets together.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000
If you didn't know, in order to have a high acceptability

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000
rate on collabs, if you do all the work, people are much more likely

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:33.000
to accept.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I currently have to do that and put it all together.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I basically have to reach out and be like, hey, do you want to host all the Veil

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.000
or girls in a collab? None of us will stream it, so you'll get all the views.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Oh, by the way, I've actually planned out the entirety of the game show, so all you have

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.000
to do is take these assets and files and put them where they belong

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
and then you get to have everything.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Yeah, basically. So I'm going to try and get that done. I don't know if

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.000
they're going to accept the person that I do want to

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.000
host it is going to accept.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Because they are incredibly busy with projects

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:17.000
all the time. But you know what,

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.000
in this world, if you don't ask and be a cheeky shit,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.000
you don't get... I was talking to Hexa

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000
because she was going to do a watch along, but she felt ill

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000
or she had to go to hospital and all of that. And I just checked up on her

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.000
and I was like, I hope you're doing all right now. And I was like, I know this is cheeky

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:41.000
but do you want to do an ASMR collab? And she was like, fuck you. And I'm like, oh, okay, shit.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Like, if you don't ask and you don't get in this world, people might be

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:49.000
like, I'm so embarrassed to be rejected by someone for not doing a collab or whatever.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Bruv. Bruv. Either they'll say yes or no.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000
And guess what? If they say no, that's not a reflection of your character, that's not a reflection

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.000
of your work, that's not a reflection of your content. Someone

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
might just know before it and that's okay. Like, then you'd be afraid

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
to put yourself out there. Like, literally, I've got what? Six ASMR

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
collabs planned? I mean, I'm about to reach out

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000
to more folk. Aww. Cat-less Link.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:21.000
I hate that I put Link in all caps now. This is killing me

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:25.000
on the inside. ASMR in the hospital

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
but you missed 100%. No, she's not in hospital, then who? Will there

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.000
be a link on Discord? Actually, I don't know.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Discord. I can't...

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
The main viewer on Twitter can't talk about it but all the girls

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000
alts can talk about it.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.000
But yeah, then there's

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:53.000
another seven ASMR

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:57.000
collab coming out. Well, there's actually three more in the works. I'm waiting for this

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000
animator to come back because they're taking their

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000
sweet arse time and it's kind of just holding up the old

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Oh, Farori. Farori, she's looking for a house. We're sure to got one.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Looking for a man in finance.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Eh, right. Want to do... What percentage are we at?

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:21.000
When can I make my cup of tea? 62%.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Okay, we're getting there. Once we hit 50%, cup of tea time. Do I make

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000
myself clear? You will all get up, you will all stretch your legs, you will all go

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:33.000
and poop poop. Well, I don't know how fast you can go a poop poop.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000
We're at 100 rupees because we're absolutely burning through it.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Sadly, you cannot give all three a house.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000
I know! It's absolutely nonsense. And I

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:49.000
realise I actually shouldn't have put that green girl in a house because her reward

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000
is she can dye your clothes a certain colour

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000
but we're already green. So why does she even offer that as a reward?

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Who knows?

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:05.000
One of them. We're at 61%. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I already have popcorn. Do I have to stretch? Yes, everyone has to stretch.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.000
What? Goron merchant. Oh no!

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I just realise we haven't helped that poor Goron. Right, we're going to do it.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
He needs more buddies. We'll get more buddies. I think what we'll do is we'll take

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000
everything like one at a time.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.000
60% we're getting down to the 50s.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000
The 90s.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.000
A mountain pokori! Does it mention their Scottish?

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Their song is actually a saying that they are fully fledged mountain

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:45.000
minish now. Oh. Ting, ting, ting along.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. What are we at? We're at 59.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Oh, we're at 59. We're getting there.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.000
You can choose.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
You can have, close whatever colour you want as long as it's green basically.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000
You have to choose the buff to win. You already helped him twice.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I know but doesn't he not end up with like six pals or something at one point?

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I basically need to dig in all the mobiles and then trade

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
a Kinstone with the walls. I'm like 100% sure that's how

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:21.000
we got his first buddy. I just got you so

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000
don't do that again. This is why we don't catch her.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Get your phone, get your phone. How many would you like to see?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000
How many would you like to see? Wager one.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Does Scotland have mountains? Yeah, we have Ben Nevis.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.000
It is the highest mountain and a young woman

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.000
tends to her cuckoos. If you help her, gather, she'll give you

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000
a reward. Yes, she will give money.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Yes, there is a mountain called Ben Nevis

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:57.000
in Scotland and people climb it. I don't think

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000
it is definitely not severe. Don't you think it's Mount Everest or anything like that?

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:05.000
It's definitely not severe. But Scotland's very hilly.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Wheaton and pitta. The couple baked bread and high roll.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Their tasty pastries hold a secret. If you're extra lucky, they'll be a helpful item inside.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.000
I like that.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Poor Goron having to rely on wishes to get some

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000
pals. Oh no! Oh!

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.000
The Vealur account finally tweeted out all our mascots and I could see everyone

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
together. Did you know Snowberry's mascots are actually the

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.000
tallest and biggest out of us all? Out of the

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000
reflames, the snippets, etc. I think it goes

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:47.000
um

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Who's the smallest? I think Pin Pals. Then

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
the... Oh no!

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Hold on. Herum,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Pin Pals, reflames, snippets,

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000
bleeding hearts, and

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Snowberries in size. So we... Snowberries are the

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.000
biggest out of us all. They're big boy.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.000
No, reflames aren't the smallest. There was a

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
height chart created. I'll need to ask the

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000
freaking concept artist. Um, because

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Emmy, some of you caught it, but

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Emmy's loading screen on her background music was the

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
mascot that was concepted, but she made her

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Pin Pals the way they look now. So I had to get an updated loading screen

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
and all that like very quickly. But her background

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000
music, it was too late. We didn't have time

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
to alter it because we had those assets. There was

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.000
a miscommunication with the asset maker

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Yumi. Yumi's fantastic by the way. I absolutely loved working with her.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:07.000
But there was a miscommunication. I was like, hey, the deadline's

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:11.000
May 1st. And she thought the deadline was June 1st

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.000
and I'm like, no, that was the debut date and it caused

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000
a bit of a back walk. Um, but we actually had

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.000
that issue. I had that issue with a lot of artists who were making assets.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Ball and Chain Soldier, whatever you CBT your way off the map because

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.000
they didn't want to see you again. I had a lot of issues when

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000
the debut date was announced

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.000
to be June 1st.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.000
All artists either saw

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.000
that and went, oh, I can take my time with my work.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
And it was like, no, I'm still asking

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000
for you to do it by the deadline I gave you, which was more than fair.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
But everyone unanimously. So if you're an artist that worked with us and you're listening

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
right now, don't feel bad because everyone fricking did it.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:07.000
And everything backlogged to May.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:11.000
My birthday was actually supposed to be when I was making shorts for everyone

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000
and that didn't happen. I was also supposed to pre-make

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
all my like, thank you ASMRs, that didn't happen.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Because everything got clogged into me.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.000
So it was a fricking developmental nightmare. My mother's birthday.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Yeah, June 1st.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
My birthday now, get wrecked. I don't know.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
You know, in the last dungeon, honestly. Your deadline is like, do not force me to move.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Yes, I was not budging on debut.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.000
I'm sorry. I was not delaying any further.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Man, miss the reflins, okay? I needed to be

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.000
at my reflins the rose.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Sorry.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
Sorry, I can't, I can't

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:43.000
say what I'm doing right now.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Wait, back to Gambo.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.000
It's spain, everything's spain.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Everything's spain.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Everything is spain.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Everything's cool when you're part of the team.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.000
You're almost at 8k, I bloody hope not.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.000
I was like, I'll be able to get the clap

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
and ASMR out right now.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Music

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Music

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Music

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Music

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Music

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Music

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Music

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Music

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Music

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Music

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Music

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Music

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Music

02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:27.840
Sorry, I'll make a cup of tea in a minute

02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:33.960
51% on the thing

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:38.560
Stony would be the killest boss ever

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:45.000
No, I know how I'm feeling right now. I'd be a terrible boss then

02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:47.120
I

02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:52.840
Yes

02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:54.960
right 51% on the

02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:03.240
percentage over Gacha, please do not gamble. Yes, I am going to try and

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
I

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I

02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:14.600
Was extinct steamed from stand

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:20.800
Sorry, sorry

02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:25.720
Azura and sheepsters is playing

02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:36.160
Fall guys if you want to join them live you most certainly can we are gacha pointing until 50% which we are at so I can go make a honey tea

02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:41.860
We have been released from our percentage

02:21:45.120 --> 02:21:49.320
Wonder I wonder how low we can actually how low can you wait?

02:21:49.320 --> 02:21:55.520
So does that mean we have 50 gacha now? We're like over halfway there. Oh, yeah, the probability is 49% now

02:21:56.080 --> 02:22:01.600
Wait, so this is terrible to gamble below the rate. This is all gonna be repeats. Is it not now?

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:04.120
Yeah, I was gonna say now that we're below 50%

02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:11.960
We have to do well, we're gonna be rich on rupees we have 125 rupees. Sorry my hair's in the way

02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:13.960
You can't see it

02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:18.760
Great, I pull that lever. Well, if only you could do it automatically. I wish I could feed it in like a

02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:21.960
Is it it's called a pachinko machine?

02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:25.120
and

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:26.960
I wish I could do it

02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:30.360
Still statistically better than one all in

02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:33.720
They aren't even plain been

02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:37.280
They've been waiting for people for like 20 minutes

02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:44.200
As if there's not enough stream snappers to play as if

02:22:44.200 --> 02:23:10.040
Yes, we already had that we've gonna go on a hundred and thirty rupees long

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:16.800
They were late to tell people they could join so now others have to download the game. Oops

02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:24.680
Chat to scare to play with the veal or girls. I was gonna say you guys are too scared to go against two mills

02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:26.680
What's going on here?

02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:29.720
Hey, you should you quaking in your little boots, huh?

02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:35.320
Hey, little ball sack trembling at the thought of the the superiority that they have over you

02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:38.040
Come on now. Don't be scared of them

02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:43.240
Yeah, I don't have it installed. Why do you get a lot of replants?

02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:49.960
How have you not got that game installed? No fool will appears in dungeons the clinical walls normal tax may not work for the boomerangs

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:54.600
It's pretty effective and they spawn in a fairy. No, I'm literally downloading as we speak, but internet

02:23:55.240 --> 02:24:00.480
Or is the internet absolutely wrecking and decking. It's trembling, but that's no way

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:04.600
How many likes did my cheeky voice click? Yeah, I'm allowed to ask

02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:10.120
I was embarrassed by like, oh my god, how many people have interacted with that?

02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:18.600
I was actually someone drew me caught up in rope and I was gonna like rate my little cringy paragraph

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:20.600
But I want to do something slightly different

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:28.680
This time around and I might be able to have time to do it after this stream if I don't go too crazy

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:31.440
I'm still getting home from work

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:33.440
Oh, yeah

02:24:33.520 --> 02:24:35.520
You can't play with the moves

02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:38.560
Wait, does fall guys have cross play with console?

02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:41.520
um

02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:44.400
700 lights. Oh my god

02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:48.240
Reflint stop

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:53.760
Yeah, the shabari picture. Yeah, so it's gonna do a cringe thing. That's it

02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:56.480
Wow

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:04.800
Right, we need to actually get all of these in order to get that last heart. So I think we're committing

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:09.520
We might be committing here and like running our bank dry

02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:16.960
Now I know I can increase the odds by increasing the shells, but we're gonna run out of shells long before that

02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:20.160
um

02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:26.960
Fall guys supports cross play. Okay. Well, there you go. If you've got a console apparently you can do a cheeky stream

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:52.960
Okay

02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:59.200
Yes, I already have that figurine unfortunately

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:02.080
If I got a figurine

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:04.160
Would you guys halt glue it for me?

02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:11.040
I don't know why people find it disgusting actually find it pretty good. I really don't mind it

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:17.440
If I had a wee Willy winky, I'd ink all the way your staff, but all you'll spill it

02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:20.400
Yes. Yes. Okay. It feels good, man

02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:26.720
Oh, sorry. I'm just putting a laser beam off in your freaking shop. Do excuse me

02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:32.240
I mean there's already the acrylic

02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:35.040
I ordered the kitchen

02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:39.840
And I was so excited for them to arrive and then I could show my hands again

02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:42.880
Well, just in an ASMR video

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:47.920
Unfortunately my french tip is starting to grow out so it doesn't look very nice

02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:51.280
Um, but that's not gonna stop me

02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:56.720
Uh, if if it looks I don't know how to take off gel because

02:26:57.280 --> 02:27:03.200
Someone said that if you try to take gel off at home, you create like mustard gas in your own freaking hoost or something like that

02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:08.240
Um

02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:15.120
Um

02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:23.840
Wizard robes get in my face

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Yeah, that stuff does not come off nicely with home put

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.480
Yeah, like I don't want to go back to the well, obviously I can't because I'm a freaking tool

02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:36.240
but um, I was literally just gonna let it all grow off and like cut my nails as

02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:41.040
Like it got like too long. I assume I can cut it without like creating mustard gas

02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:44.240
Or is it gonna be too hard to cut?

02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:49.120
Actually that reminds me. I need to make uh your tap in ASMR

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:51.760
um

02:27:53.760 --> 02:28:00.640
Because when you have like hard acrylic nails the ASMR comes out so much better. Yeah, it costs fine. Okay, that's fine

02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:07.120
Don't make this bleed to our money. Oh, that's mustard gas. Yeah. You have to wait from a growing up. Yeah, that's fine. I don't I don't mind that

02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:09.280
Oh

02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:16.400
All of these self-transformants have the fighting tournament at the PCORI festival for they are the great potential

02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:18.640
Oh, they see great potential in blink

02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.360
Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, so we've not even met all of the masters yet

02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:34.080
Okay, how many have we gone through we've not even gone through a hundred pools yet. Jeez

02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:36.880
Um

02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:39.620
Stroney, I will literally do anything you ask. Oh

02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:53.120
Yes, I am waiting for the key chains and then I can do like uh

02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:55.680
Maybe just be like a regular ASMR video

02:28:55.680 --> 02:29:00.480
But I'll just tap on everything and start like tapping on the girls faces and their wee key chains and that

02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:03.680
I think I'm so cute. It's a coin name

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:11.680
And I'll be like this is this is in me and this is a zero and this is a circle and this is sheepsters

02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:14.800
um

02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:20.480
I've probably said it but I gave the girls nicknames long before they had glee rock

02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:27.120
Appears in the cavern of flames a glee rock has a hard rocky shale and mount carino hating and lava

02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.440
I thoroughly enjoyed him as a boss. I think that was a really good boss

02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:37.440
Didn't enjoy the jumpy jumpy boss ear tempo. That was not really for me to be honest

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:42.240
Well, I'm to stop and after 50 percent. I'm addicted

02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:46.080
I lose 100 percent of the gacha. I don't pool

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:54.320
See even though we're now at 180 coins. I started at like less than 100 for the duplication

02:29:54.880 --> 02:29:59.040
Same I will do many many things to make Johnny

02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:03.920
You you being happy makes me happy. I don't need nothing else

02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:06.960
Other than a smile on your goofy face

02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:14.160
Maybe maybe if I'm really really well behaved. I might even get a giggle out. Yeah a little hee hee

02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.160
Happiness feedback. Oh, yeah

02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:26.800
Oh

02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:31.600
Minish Vati before he became a sorcerer

02:30:31.600 --> 02:30:35.920
He was a simple minish. He had always been entranced by the evil that lives in the hearts of men

02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:42.800
There's not evil in the hearts of men must catch a gambler stop before winning big literally be with the next one

02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:45.760
Shawnee does your model have any pierce things?

02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:49.600
My model doesn't have the pierce things. Um

02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:55.280
Originally my bikini toggle was actually gonna have indents to show

02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:57.440
I I'm

02:30:57.440 --> 02:30:59.440
to show the pierce things

02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:01.520
but um

02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:07.040
It got there was a few there was a few development on the show. So it's like such a small detail that it doesn't matter

02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:08.880
Um

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:10.880
Do you have any pierce things? I did

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:13.760
I don't have any facial pierce things

02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:16.400
I don't have any ear pierce things

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:19.360
The rest is up to you

02:31:24.160 --> 02:31:29.680
Oh god, we're at 41 percent. This is getting bitey. Only the fun one

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:34.320
Um, oh

02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:40.400
A mayfly the great mayfly fairy on mount crannel. She provides you a larger bomb bag. Oh wait, so I have seen her

02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:47.680
So I've not seen the green fly fairy wherever a dragon fly fairy. Sorry green flies

02:31:49.520 --> 02:31:51.520
A belly no

02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:55.840
I see was actually supposed to have a belly piercing in her development art

02:31:56.480 --> 02:31:59.920
You'll see it. If you didn't see the exposed room. She's doing a short about it

02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:02.880
You know for 40 percent

02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:07.600
Catch a chance. We're winning pretty big right now. Hold on. We're on a good streak. Let's not forget

02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:11.760
I forgot we're going to play this game. I'm like, don't worry. Don't worry

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:17.440
Um, we are at the stage before everything goes to our chaos

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
So an armpit piercing

02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:29.920
Um, we are currently just gacha pawning out the wazoo because apparently we need all 100 percent gachas

02:32:30.480 --> 02:32:34.960
A in order to get access to a heart that we'll need so we can have full life

02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:42.160
Every gacha pill layer with cell is a little cap a strange creature that looks at first like a cap

02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:46.400
He speaks roughly and treats link like a child, but he actually really likes link. Oh

02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:57.440
Bum piercing got it. Why some surprise? I don't know. I've never heard of an armpit piercing. Oh 37 percent as rough

02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:03.600
40 percent is nearly 50 50 totally worth it. Spoken like a true gamble

02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:06.560
Spoken like a true gamble

02:33:08.240 --> 02:33:14.240
A bunny. No, my bunny is not pierced. I absolutely would not have anything near it

02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:19.680
I do not have a a slight comprehension of the

02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:22.320
desirability

02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:24.080
to

02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:24.960
Oh

02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:26.400
No

02:33:26.400 --> 02:33:31.600
A bunny. Absolutely not. Are you joking? Why are we talking about piercings?

02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:36.000
Because I may or may not have some piercings. Do you want to hear it? Oh, hold on

02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:39.280
I think you may be able to hear it if I mute the in-game audio

02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.600
Hold on

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:47.920
You may be able to hear this

02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:53.200
Do you hear that from a little nail against it?

02:33:57.200 --> 02:33:59.200
There you go that one's for you

02:33:59.200 --> 02:34:01.200
Ah

02:34:01.440 --> 02:34:05.520
Tapping it. Oh, should I do tapping ASMR?

02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:09.600
Piercing tapping ASMR. Would you guys be done for that?

02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:12.960
That would actually be kind of hilarious

02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:21.360
Well, let's pray obvious then and you trigger on lot. Oh, yes. Oh my god, right. I'll record that because that's hilarious

02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:25.840
Piercing tapping ASMR, wink, wink, nudge, nudge

02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:28.320
Yes

02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:31.440
Did you just? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I did

02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:39.840
Oh, I know our gacha nightmares. We're now at 200 rupees. He we're actually starting to really run into it

02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:43.440
Can we tap it for you in the ASMR?

02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:46.640
Great. Now pull that lever. I'm pulling it

02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:52.320
New unlocked someone is wearing only a hoodie again. No

02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:55.840
Maybe

02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:03.760
Yeah, like I had I had a good time yesterday. I do not deserve to wear a bra right now a bra

02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:08.720
So

02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:13.600
I've been wanting you to make piercing taps. That's funny

02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:17.680
Well, you got your wish because I can make it super easily

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.960
I need to make the tummy rumble in ASMR as well ASMR lying on your girlfriend's stomach, but it won't

02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:24.960
I

02:35:25.200 --> 02:35:30.800
That'll probably be my next like meme ASMR. I'm not really sure it's a thank you ASMR. I think it's a more of a meme ASMR

02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:35.600
Only wearing a hoodie nothing else. Yeah, I don't even I don't even have socks on

02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:41.520
Heartbeat ASMR when you want to hear my heartbeat

02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:42.960
It's not very relaxing

02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:46.800
But honestly, do you want me to talk during it or do you just want like breathing?

02:35:47.520 --> 02:35:53.920
And heartbeat because of where the mic is placed you can hear like what I breathe and in the other ear quite well when it's against me

02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:59.120
It's not going good. It's not going well. We're getting absolutely rigged

02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:03.040
I think I asked for taps on the last day

02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:09.120
Socks are the tool of Satan. I honestly don't mind socks because it kind of contains the sweat

02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:14.960
Out of curiosity is a picture. I'm going to be audios or will the rest of the stuff

02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:18.960
Or when or will you and the rest of the girls we do and other stuff?

02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:22.720
Um, definitely like early access to meme stuff is

02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:27.280
Like for me early access or like youtube archive to my audios perfectly fine

02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:32.960
Um, as for other stuff. No, it's like audio based content

02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:36.480
Talking to please and we talk

02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:39.280
Oh, no

02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:43.280
Yeah, I'm feeling this percentage probability debuff. This is getting rough

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:48.400
They're one in three now. We're at one in three

02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:52.880
With how hot it is over by me me we're in

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:58.320
Even we're in a hoodie. That's worth. Okay. We got it. We got it one in three one in three

02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:05.360
Cry at ranting during the heartbeat ranting about what came what see this catcher game and legend is elder

02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:12.400
Yeah, freaking probability dropping down to the floor. I bet you probably the probability will be one by the time we're done with it

02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:16.560
and

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:18.560
The wind tried

02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:21.360
The wind sure

02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:24.880
Renting about whatever conspiracies on your mind that day

02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:33.920
Oh, I have a really controversial one but might filter people

02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.320
But then it means more of the tight-knit community. Maybe it's win-win

02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:40.480
I

02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:44.240
Strongly be movie script when absolutely not I have no desire for that

02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:48.720
I've seen that meme done a few times as well, but if the meme's been done before I might

02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:51.600
Whereas like

02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:56.320
I I don't want to say anything but I have to admit I've never looked up clapping without

02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:00.640
Clapping ASMR, but without my hands before like I think that's funny as heck, you know

02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:04.000
And then again, it's probably already made and it's sitting on youtube

02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:08.880
Shawnee always does the filter and yeah, I do it myself. Don't worry. We demand the filter

02:38:09.760 --> 02:38:12.320
Okay, so you know how there's been abortion bans

02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:16.960
It's absolutely nothing to do about religion or anything or any of that crap

02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:19.920
A mold worm appears in minish roads

02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:23.760
They come out of the ground when they sense free if you get swallowed you'll take damage get all dirty

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Watch out because when you're dirty

02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:28.480
I've never seen that enemy

02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:29.920
and

02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:32.000
It's about like it's about

02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:36.720
Raising the population because the population is crashing right now

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:42.400
And what happens when a population crashes? Oh, you can't have infinite growth

02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.240
No infinite growth for you capitalist cogs. No, no, no, no

02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:54.880
Um, so that's why bond reception and abortions are being outlawed because we need slaves

02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:56.800
We need poor

02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:00.400
Because you know who benefits from abortions and all that stuff

02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:07.200
People who are not in a position financially and responsibly to raise children. That's who benefits from that really

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.520
and

02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:11.520
Embryo and all that

02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:14.160
So yeah, um

02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:16.960
We need more cogs in the capitalist machine

02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:18.320
so

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:20.320
Yeah, again, capital is interesting

02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:24.160
because yeah, um because of the nature of

02:39:24.160 --> 02:39:30.240
Of um development as well. So if you think two generations back your grandparents will say

02:39:30.640 --> 02:39:34.880
I had seven brothers and sisters and then your mum and dad

02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:39.520
They had three brothers and sisters and then your mum and dad had

02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:43.920
I produced you solo because at the rate of success

02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:48.160
You don't need to farm all these children popping out at you willy-nilly

02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.240
So the population is heading for a crash landing

02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:54.640
fair

02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:56.640
Uh ace more running about capitalism

02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:03.840
Me mum's the youngest of 11. How many are you gonna have those the question?

02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:06.000
because

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:11.440
Statistically it goes big party a big party big family medium family

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Uh, and we're we're heading to one to zero territory. Actually. No, we're already in zero territory

02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:24.000
Isn't south korea zero point four for the replacement rate for every two couple

02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:29.200
Wait, zero point four. Yeah for every two couples. There's one child

02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:32.080
Does that make sense?

02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:37.680
One they're gonna be a popper. Yes, exactly. Um

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:42.400
Depends on how many you want. Oh me how many I want

02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:44.480
And

02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:46.000
Um

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:51.280
South korea is at zero point seven. Okay, and I think it went down. Yeah

02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:58.880
This is the uncap rhetoric I membership for yeah, I don't even know what uncap is but thank you

02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:02.320
Oh any capitalism report. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here

02:41:04.240 --> 02:41:06.240
Um

02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:10.080
We'll be having plenty of kids on the farm. No, you're my kid

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:12.720
Is that weird

02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:14.720
You're the father. What?

02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:19.120
Oh, I jumped. I was like wait link and jump. Yes link has a cape

02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:21.360
um

02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:23.360
Do you even want children? Yeah

02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:31.760
With a boisterous crowd and a cute crest these feathered friends are the most popular pets in high rule. The baby chicks are like small boos

02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:35.840
Uh, anarchy. Oh an arachnid

02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:38.800
Oh, you're teaching me phrases. I don't even

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:44.080
No, you are my children and I'm also pregnant with you and you're the father

02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:50.400
Uh, I'm still not commissioned that artwork. Yeah, I need to hurry up and do it so I can make it because it's hilarious

02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:53.920
Ah

02:41:54.720 --> 02:41:57.920
What's your name gammy gammy gammy atlas blossom

02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:00.560
Nice to see you to see you nice

02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:03.520
Sweet home

02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:05.600
Boy girl both how many

02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:08.960
Uh, wherever the reeflings are that's how many

02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:13.120
Whatever number we've got we've gained, you know

02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:17.360
Wow, I've already had that

02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:20.320
We're now at 270 coins

02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:25.360
8 000 reeflings. That's a lot of birthing. I'm gonna be honest

02:42:26.880 --> 02:42:29.920
Birth throws are winning right now. They are absolutely winning

02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:33.680
Jen

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:36.640
Uh, I'd rather raise a dog

02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:41.440
To be a grandpa of its pup since I love dogs cats. I'm allergic to rip being allergic to cat

02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.080
I got two precious poodles

02:42:45.040 --> 02:42:47.040
I don't think I'm getting any more putters on

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:52.400
So many questions about that

02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:54.400
What about

02:42:54.400 --> 02:42:59.920
About me being prego with you, but you're also the dad at the same time. Like don't think about it too much

02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:01.920
It's like a little warp

02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:07.360
Um, because like if you Azura's lore is that she's actually your literal mummy

02:43:08.240 --> 02:43:13.920
She creates civilization which makes her your mom technically and all technicality

02:43:14.720 --> 02:43:16.720
Uh, but I birthed

02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:19.760
Azura technically

02:43:21.120 --> 02:43:25.840
Oh, we got a new one our percentage is now less than one in three

02:43:27.120 --> 02:43:29.760
It's less than 33 percent. So it's less than one in three

02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:32.720
One in three to the infinite

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.720
It makes perfect sense to me. Okay. Well, I'm glad it does because

02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:39.840
Prego strongy was off

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:43.440
Yeah

02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:45.920
Do you want to try some cuttlefish milk?

02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:52.000
You just have to do you have to do something first to make the cuttlefish milk come in though

02:43:52.880 --> 02:43:54.880
Oh

02:43:55.680 --> 02:44:01.600
Young couple Romeo. Oh raw mayo and julietta grew up next door. They're dating now

02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:05.760
But they plan to marry once they get their pets approval. Then you go talk to their dog

02:44:08.080 --> 02:44:10.080
Yes, god, please

02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:14.240
I wish to do that. Maybe I'll get some fun out of that

02:44:15.360 --> 02:44:17.280
um

02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:21.040
Like what milton tin I got a beefling diet through

02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:27.920
How would that even work? Would you have to get the piercing though? No, um, if you didn't know

02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:30.720
boobly mooblies, um

02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:34.800
It's not like one singular flow of

02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:39.920
Milk, um, it's like little tiny

02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:42.880
multiple little things

02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:47.200
Um, so the piercings do not have to be removed for that

02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:50.640
Just means you have to suck a bit harder

02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:53.920
Oh

02:44:55.120 --> 02:45:04.080
Refreshing treat udders udders. Can he call it udders? That's that's rough calling it udders

02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:08.640
We'll have to get a zero to demonstrate

02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:12.240
Done for that. We have a deal

02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:18.160
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to put the heat in on and get a cup of tea because it's frozen

02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:25.760
Nothing nothing. Uh, apparently Aussie houses have like the worst insulation ever

02:45:25.840 --> 02:45:27.840
There's like nay insulation to them at all

02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:31.680
I believe it because I've rented

02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:36.160
And uh, it's absolute piss, so I'm gonna need for the heat on

02:45:37.440 --> 02:45:39.440
Are you saying you want us?

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Exactly

02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:45.600
Oh, oh, they're called chuchu. That's such a good name

02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:52.160
Is there like a percentage thing? No, what goes down here?

02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:56.640
I don't know what goes down there

02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:04.160
But there isn't a percentage we've got five tiger scrolls. I'm gonna need a few more. I thought I had more than five

02:46:07.520 --> 02:46:11.280
Stony sand in his early. Yeah, I'm gonna need to have you do a certain demonstration

02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:19.280
If you didn't know, is there a chibi or live on fall guys right now?

02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:22.800
Wow

02:46:22.800 --> 02:46:28.880
Oh, I just got weird pain on my leg and my ankle. Please pull the memory amputism. Leave me alone

02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:34.720
Oh, we're on 30% now. So if we hit the 20s, that's one in five

02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:37.840
One in five gacha pools

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Wow

02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:48.240
867 shells, we're gonna be here forever. Should we take a break? Should we take a break and do explore?

02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:54.960
Great now pull the lever. Yes. Yes. Okay. We'll take a break. I'll get a tea in me. I will go do some other stuff

02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:57.360
This is there a

02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:59.440
live on the commune

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:01.440
Oh, I like like

02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:06.000
Uh, yes, we'll take a break and we'll go do some questing and we'll come back to this

02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:10.880
I am going to 100% this game because I don't think I've ever actually done it before

02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:12.400
Um

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:14.240
And I wouldn't mind 100% in it with you

02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:19.440
Just gives me another reason to yap your head off for like hours on hours because I thought this is gonna be a forever stream

02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:21.520
but certainly in turn another way

02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:23.680
Well, she can

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:26.880
I'm just being about domain

02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:32.480
Don't overthink it and we could take a drink and get the drink

02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.520
Okay, I'm gonna go make a honey tea

02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:40.560
Uh, when we get the next successful gacha pool and we'll go for a tinkle

02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:42.880
Right go away and board head you

02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:47.200
I said at the next successful gacha pool

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:53.360
At the next we will go make a tea

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:06.880
Ah London this small ranch lies just outside high rule town father and daughter teen Talon and

02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:13.440
Malon run it and they sell the finest malon more like melons because I know where that milk really comes from

02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:16.800
Okay

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:20.960
We will go and take a very quick break. I just need to tinkle um and two

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
I'm just using a kin stone

02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:27.680
The game is nice and gives me kin stones when I need them, but I guess

02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:33.840
Right, I'll leave you guys by the little chicken so you can go

02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:39.200
Okay, oh wait, can I sit on these chairs? Can I role-playing sit on the chair? Yeah, okay?

02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:41.840
We're totally at a cafe date right now

02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:46.160
Hey, I will be like a few minutes. I just need to boil the kettle

02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:50.480
Give me give me

02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:53.600
Three minutes, okay

02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:05.840
Oh

02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:35.840
Oh

02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:05.840
Oh

02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:35.840
Oh

02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:05.840
Oh

02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:35.840
Oh

02:52:03.840 --> 02:52:05.840
Oh

02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:35.840
Oh

02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:05.840
Oh

02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:35.840
Oh

02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:37.840
Oh

02:53:37.840 --> 02:53:39.840
Oh

02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:06.640
All right, I've gone for a piss and the kettle's boiling Gimli says hi and I put the heating on

02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:10.420
I'll just be a minute. I'm heating up a soup like in the microwave

02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:38.640
Oh

02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:08.640
Oh

02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:38.640
Oh

02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:53.840
The way you were brave thing I thought we were gonna have another in the endurance stream

02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:08.640
Oh

02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:38.640
Oh

02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:08.640
Oh

02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:38.640
Oh

02:57:57.120 --> 02:57:59.120
The way you were breathing

02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:08.880
I know you came in here

02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:35.280
We are saved yes

02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:38.720
Oh

02:58:39.040 --> 02:58:41.200
Thank you for the five a

02:58:41.200 --> 02:58:42.640
Rolly legend

02:58:42.640 --> 02:58:45.280
I really struggled to say your name to two L's on it

02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:49.520
And my brain always recessed on us that I'm saying to me. Hi Gimli. Yeah

02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:56.480
I've got you only have one cat. No, I have two putters. I have baby boy and my little princess. Gimli is my princess

02:58:57.120 --> 02:59:01.520
and baby boy is my little munchkin cat that I

02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:05.520
The universe sent to me as a laugh

02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:07.920
and

02:59:08.160 --> 02:59:10.160
I am a big

02:59:10.640 --> 02:59:14.160
believer in not breeding cat breeds that are detrimental to their health

02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:19.760
And then the universe said here take this boy and I was like right fine. I will take this boy

02:59:20.960 --> 02:59:23.120
Um, and I love them to pieces

02:59:24.320 --> 02:59:28.080
He's a very silly cat though because he hurt himself and I had to take him to the vet

02:59:29.040 --> 02:59:31.040
Which was not a fun experience

02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:36.000
Uh, because cats were really dumb and don't show any pain

02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:40.000
Uh, and I just it was petting him and his like

02:59:40.720 --> 02:59:44.000
Blood had matted his fur on his back leg and I was like, what did you do?

02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:48.960
And then I managed to cut it away and he had a big nasty gash on his leg

02:59:49.360 --> 02:59:51.360
but um, he healed up nicely

02:59:51.760 --> 02:59:53.760
and and

02:59:54.160 --> 02:59:59.360
I was having to warn the vets because I was like, I'm so sorry, but like I've only just got him

02:59:59.520 --> 03:00:03.520
I have no idea what his temperament is with vets like if he's aggressive or not

03:00:03.520 --> 03:00:09.040
So please be careful and they were like he was the sweetest boy we've had all day and I'm like

03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:13.600
Shucks, you just say that to everyone, don't you? You've got me blushing about my baby boy

03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:16.640
Um, but I'm so sorry

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.640
But I'm gonna be eating with my in my hands. Okay

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.640
I'll try and eat that because I should be lucky

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
Oh

03:00:46.640 --> 03:00:49.440
I have to take your time trying to heal it

03:00:50.160 --> 03:00:52.160
Oh

03:00:55.040 --> 03:01:01.120
It's not toast it's chicken lettuce onion on like a flatbread

03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:11.040
Are you gonna be a cat lady? No, I'm gonna be a farm lady wearing milk reeflings all day long

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Mmm

03:01:14.960 --> 03:01:19.920
Oh, I'll tell you something actually about psychology. Do you know

03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:28.160
Why is unattractive to women if you don't like animals? I'll see if someone can guess why

03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:38.960
Um, but why do you think that women do not like it if men say they do not like animals

03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:45.040
Because then you can't care for them

03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:51.440
Shows a lack of empathy. Oh you're getting close indicates. You don't want children. You're getting there

03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:54.000
so

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:57.600
This is absolutely outrageous to say but it is what it is. Um

03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:03.200
Psychology wise animals are viewed as lesser, aren't they?

03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:07.520
Some men view women as lesser

03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:11.840
So if man don't like animal, what does man think about women?

03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:14.720
Hmm

03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:17.760
Scary beans and that is why women naturally do not like men

03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:25.280
Or gravitate to words men that do not like animals if you do not like animals. I'm so sorry, but psychologically it's a big old, uh

03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:28.240
Monkey

03:02:28.800 --> 03:02:30.800
Mm-hmm

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:39.600
I love animals, but not women. Why the fuck are you what?

03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:48.000
Do I see or am I just one of the bros be honest or am I like the neighbor next door come on

03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:51.200
Show me the goods show me the goods

03:02:52.160 --> 03:03:00.720
Um, I have some terrible news to break to you about what I've got going on downstairs if you don't like women

03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:06.480
I'm literally I'm literally the guy that doesn't want animals in their house

03:03:08.880 --> 03:03:12.640
That's currently petting his dog while getting thinking about getting a second. Yeah

03:03:14.080 --> 03:03:17.920
That's like the most adorable thing my dad was like that with cats is like no

03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:21.760
We're not getting another cat and then there would be some sob story

03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:26.880
Our stray would show up. I think we've had three strays show up

03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:31.040
Um and I don't

03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:38.240
You're one of the bros for me. Honestly. All right grip grip session boys. Let's do a soggy biscuit. Well, what about it?

03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:44.880
Wait a minute you're a woman

03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:50.480
My little baby saved me from being forever little pudders

03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:58.080
Can't have animals. I'm allergic. Oh, that's a shame. There's some hypoallergenic freaks, I think

03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:04.880
But I'm a woman

03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:07.600
Oh

03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:13.040
I love animals, but I'm terrible at taking care of them. Yeah

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:15.760
I'm I'm

03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:18.640
I love my pudders so much. They're they're just perfection

03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:22.240
But you have to treat me like an animal. You need to take me on a walk and stuff

03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:25.120
You know

03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:32.720
You're opening a pen

03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:42.480
Are the animals in a box in a dark room whilst you're pressed against the box by any chance

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:54.480
I thought it was the other way around. Oh, no, no, no, no the leash and the collar goes both ways

03:04:55.120 --> 03:04:58.720
For once it's a not on me, but on you

At least connects our collars together. I don't think we're coordinated enough to walk side by side on our hands and knees, are we?

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
You can take me on a walk anytime

03:05:49.680 --> 03:05:51.680

03:06:51.040 --> 03:06:56.240
Elton ring Joe between straw and reef and spender who walks who wait

But either way isn't a punishment

03:07:00.800 --> 03:07:02.640

But there should be something to trade on a wall, but is it gonna be here? I don't think so

03:14:03.600 --> 03:14:05.600

How do I become small in this area?

03:15:09.200 --> 03:15:11.200
Can't do it that way

03:15:11.360 --> 03:15:13.360
It's not possible

03:15:13.600 --> 03:15:16.160
That can take me into the bakery if I'm small

03:15:18.480 --> 03:15:21.520

You ought to be careful when you're running around. Not all of us are so nice. Well, you're in my way. So

03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:48.000
Right

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:51.440
So now we need to be tiny and go all the way this way

03:15:52.240 --> 03:15:54.320
Oh, wait, is this all gonna be nice? Hi popper

03:15:56.080 --> 03:15:58.080

03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:00.480
Nope

03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:05.600
Maybe I should go hide in the cocoon league. It may be dangerous. So it seems like there's danger everywhere. Oh

03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:07.840
for guys

03:16:07.840 --> 03:16:10.160

Wait, let's go to the bakery first. She does show up at both the oracle

03:16:15.600 --> 03:16:17.600

Do you need me to clean up? I will clean up right now. Don't think I won't

03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:44.240
Have his business not going good for them. Sorry if they're charging 60 rupees for a slice of cake sauce

03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:46.320
But your business should be doing fine

03:16:46.800 --> 03:16:52.560

03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:55.760
Sorry guys. Don't need to suck your

03:16:56.560 --> 03:16:58.560
Keep that on

03:16:58.640 --> 03:17:01.680
Sorry a few and fewer people are coming to buy bread

03:17:02.560 --> 03:17:07.360
I can't believe how dangerous it's gotten around here. Uh, I wonder if it's because all the monsters are back

03:17:08.800 --> 03:17:10.800
Oh, there's just money up here

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:16.000
We don't need no money. Well, we may if we're buying shells actually

03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:26.560
All right, I'm gonna try and finish my now I might as well just send it then. Um, I'll try and finish my tea my cup of tea

03:17:34.400 --> 03:17:36.400
These little flower paths are actually

03:17:37.520 --> 03:17:40.560
It's exactly what I wanted to see. This is the stuff we need

03:17:41.680 --> 03:17:45.520
Give it to me. Oh my god. We complete another heart

03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:49.120
How many one two three four five six seven

03:17:49.760 --> 03:17:52.400
If seven are missing what seven times four

03:17:53.360 --> 03:17:55.760
Uh, wait, let me calculate it

03:17:56.560 --> 03:17:58.560
seven times

03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:00.720
four

03:18:01.120 --> 03:18:05.760
Four seven seven fourteen twenty one twenty eight boom. That's right

03:18:07.120 --> 03:18:09.120
I did maths. What are you gonna do about it?

03:18:10.080 --> 03:18:16.160
Take me to me a hot second to come out with that there, but we got there in the end. That's the most important part

03:18:17.360 --> 03:18:18.800
Uh

03:18:18.800 --> 03:18:23.680
Right, I don't think there's anything we can do right now that ghost is unfortunately still in the way

03:18:24.240 --> 03:18:25.760
galaxy bean streamer

03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:26.800
Oh had to do that

03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:31.920
I was like I was gonna do like four times five, but I'm like wait, that's not gonna get me to the number that I need

03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:34.160
I need more of those numbers

03:18:34.960 --> 03:18:38.320
She doesn't want to trade you don't want to do a freaking thing

03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:41.520

03:18:45.200 --> 03:18:48.080
Yeah, I can buy shells if I really need

03:18:49.120 --> 03:18:51.120
Wait, you can demand

03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:53.920
sometimes

03:18:53.920 --> 03:18:56.320
And I don't think anyone wants to trade

03:18:57.760 --> 03:19:01.360
Kinstones not we're out of kinstone traders

03:19:04.560 --> 03:19:06.560
Right, I think

03:19:06.640 --> 03:19:12.880
We've done what we can for the towns people on the most part anyway. Oh, no

03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:18.560
Yeah, I grab this how much is this 50

03:19:21.920 --> 03:19:26.560
And then we need to feed the reeflings to make sure they're okay, I will get a croissant this time

03:19:29.200 --> 03:19:31.200
Yeah, I'll buy

03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:36.720
Wait if I buy everything do the minish change

03:19:38.080 --> 03:19:41.760
Maybe the minish are like yay. We're sold out if I buy everything

03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:44.640
Hold on

03:19:45.040 --> 03:19:48.800
Welcome tasty tasty. Yes, bye, please

03:19:50.720 --> 03:19:53.520
Yay, we've got a blue one. Let's go give me give me

03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:55.760
Oh

03:19:55.760 --> 03:20:00.080
The question but if you got a color for his reef and what color I think it would

03:20:01.120 --> 03:20:03.120
Oh green might be a bit ugly though

03:20:05.760 --> 03:20:10.080
Welcome, please buy whatever you like I have terrible news. You ain't got nothing to buy

03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:15.120
Hmm, right. Well, that was a waste of money. Let me guess it's gonna restart as soon as we go back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

03:20:16.480 --> 03:20:21.040
Um, I want to say green, but I don't think it would look that nice. I think black just black looks good

03:20:21.840 --> 03:20:30.480
Purple like my eyeball my eyes are blue and my eyes are blue and yellow. Have I really not shown you my eyes enough?

03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:37.360
Like they're blue. Oh, are they purple? Hold on. They look blue to me

03:20:39.600 --> 03:20:43.360
I'm not colorblind. What color are my eyes? Tell me right now

03:20:45.120 --> 03:20:47.120
Blueish purple

03:20:47.920 --> 03:20:52.560
Okay, now tell me what color my eyes are

03:20:55.680 --> 03:20:57.680
Too late now

03:20:57.840 --> 03:21:03.040
Oh, that's those. Oh, that that looks more purple. Well, okay, that definitely looks more purple

03:21:05.120 --> 03:21:09.760
Yeah, oh no, I think you guys are right the black rock headquarters

03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:14.800
Stop that's my problem. My favorite. Oh, where did the heck did I go? Hold on. Sorry

03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:19.360
I'm too much. Sorry. I'm being an unprofessional streamer at the moment

03:21:22.880 --> 03:21:29.440
Black rock headquarters. So I can't get over how fucking hilarious that meme is. Do any of you guys want to trade Ken Stone?

03:21:30.960 --> 03:21:34.480
Welcome to the library. Right. Let me finish this here. Keep saying I'm gonna finish it. I don't

03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:47.280
Uh

03:21:49.600 --> 03:21:53.440
Okay, whatever. Um, oh, maybe this guy will

03:21:56.880 --> 03:22:00.160
Oh, yeah the exchange Ken Stone pieces with me

03:22:02.880 --> 03:22:08.720
Have you ever watched like a medican popcorn? It's always that like

03:22:15.520 --> 03:22:17.520
Oh

03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:25.280
My god, you're so right the bell in the middle. You're so freaking right. Wow

03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:29.840
Yes, I completely forgot

03:22:31.680 --> 03:22:33.600
Okay

03:22:33.600 --> 03:22:39.440
Now I think I've done everything if no one is trading me pieces. I want to but basically backtrack

03:22:40.400 --> 03:22:43.840
Oh, no, we need to do we need if we need to um

03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:49.760
Yes, hold on. Hold on. I think we need to trade that little minish guy

03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:52.640
Um

03:22:52.640 --> 03:22:54.080

03:22:54.080 --> 03:22:56.080
His wish will be er

03:22:57.440 --> 03:22:59.280
He'll make a

03:22:59.280 --> 03:23:04.160
I am so sorry. I'm trying to speak one sentence right now. I think this becomes a house

03:23:04.720 --> 03:23:06.560
Oh, no, it doesn't

03:23:06.560 --> 03:23:08.560
But it's not him that makes the house

03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:11.360
Happy to help good girl. Hey

03:23:14.880 --> 03:23:17.840
I've been submissive enough for one day

03:23:19.600 --> 03:23:21.600
Right, so that was all about reading

03:23:22.880 --> 03:23:24.880
So then what was this?

03:23:25.840 --> 03:23:30.000
You know can it must be the one that's in the builders heart

03:23:36.080 --> 03:23:38.080
I'm not watching professional corn

03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:42.160
I just find it funny because if you ever watch like American

03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:45.680
Like mainstream all you'll hear is

03:23:48.880 --> 03:23:50.880
Okay

03:23:51.440 --> 03:23:53.440
I don't know how to get that house down

03:23:57.440 --> 03:23:59.440
No one wants to use with me

03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:03.520
What's that? I should stay indoors just because there's monsters about don't be silly

03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:07.520
I literally if you ever

03:24:07.520 --> 03:24:09.520

Without fail right. He doesn't do it can still infusion which is fun. I'm finally home from work time to eat rest well

03:24:16.160 --> 03:24:18.160
Sleepy

Maybe I'll build here. I think yeah, but how do I get you to build there? How?

03:24:23.040 --> 03:24:25.040
I don't know

03:24:25.200 --> 03:24:29.040
Okay, everyone's dialogue has now changed to be worried about the monsters

03:24:29.760 --> 03:24:31.760
That's curious

03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:33.840
Oh him him him you're new

And I'm secretly 87 years old oji san spotted and I lay oji san on site. Yeah, we did it

03:24:57.600 --> 03:25:01.120
Okay, now if we go in and out it should be built

03:25:01.840 --> 03:25:07.040
No, not yet. I'll build here. I think wait. How does that progress?

03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:11.200
Oh, wow it progressed. Okay

Tell you I just need a single female. I bet you need a single female

03:25:18.880 --> 03:25:24.240

03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:42.400
You want red buff or blue buff. What does red or blue do a single one?

03:25:47.200 --> 03:25:53.200
Red gives damage blue gives defense I may actually need blue on ironically

03:25:53.760 --> 03:25:55.760
I

03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:00.560
I am more of a defense than uh, what does green do then?

03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:04.800
I am a defense boy

03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:11.520

Welcome. What do you give me? Yeah, sure 10 rupees. Take it. What would I do?

03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:25.440
What would I do? Level one is more than enough to take your money, but if you're feeling particularly we've already gone level two

03:26:26.320 --> 03:26:29.120
Uh level two. Why not?

03:26:30.400 --> 03:26:32.400

Uh, there may be kinstone pieces if we cut the grass

03:28:41.120 --> 03:28:43.120
No, I told the lie clearly

03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:46.080
There's a beetle coming after my ankles

03:28:49.840 --> 03:28:54.640

By the way, have you been using all of the items you've found if you ever get stuck somewhere?

03:31:12.720 --> 03:31:15.760
Use that trick. Just try everything in your inventory. I love that

03:31:16.080 --> 03:31:18.800
Literally just ram your head into the wall until sun happens

03:31:19.600 --> 03:31:23.600
What if I miss you fell asleep? Are you gonna sleep? You're allowed to sleep if you need to sleep

03:31:24.080 --> 03:31:28.160
Um, we are now just doing all the little sade activities

03:31:29.360 --> 03:31:34.160
Um, because we're about to hit the end game, but if we hit it

03:31:34.880 --> 03:31:38.800
Oh, it got 20 rupees from that choice. If we hit the end game, then

03:31:39.600 --> 03:31:44.960
Uh, a lot of things aren't very nice. So we're gonna try and 100% it like right now

Oh my god, look at us sleeping. We're so cute. Oh my god, Esso looks absolutely gone

03:32:04.400 --> 03:32:05.840
Oh

03:32:05.840 --> 03:32:11.120
Yeah, that was just what I needed to get back in the fight. Let's get going. Oh, we had a little map together

03:32:12.240 --> 03:32:15.760
Best feeler girl step on me. Uh, she be she has heels

03:32:16.960 --> 03:32:19.600
She'll make sure it hurts and you say thank you after

03:32:22.160 --> 03:32:26.400
Um, I've already been in here. Haven't we? Yes, it was a heart. That's perfectly fine

03:32:27.280 --> 03:32:34.000
No, no, no, no. Oh, sorry. Um, I um, I've already done this tingling, but just in case

03:32:36.800 --> 03:32:41.440
Yeah, okay. Have you found all the tingling brothers? You can fuse kinstones and we'll have a certain fact

03:32:41.840 --> 03:32:45.760
Tingle is positive. You will get something very very good. Good luck, Mr. Fairy

03:32:45.840 --> 03:32:49.760
Wait, why am I a fairy? Who are you calling a fairy? You're the one dressed up in a freaking

03:32:50.880 --> 03:32:52.880
I can't make that joke, but

03:32:53.840 --> 03:33:00.720
What's this if it shells? Oh, that's how I get my other bottles. That's fantastic

03:33:01.520 --> 03:33:03.520
um

03:33:05.600 --> 03:33:09.760
There's a beanstalk here that isn't uh growing

03:33:12.800 --> 03:33:16.640
There's a reason tingle calls you a fairy that can't remember. I must be related to other war

03:33:17.680 --> 03:33:21.120
Hey, we're going to do a complete backtrack of the woods right now

03:33:22.080 --> 03:33:24.720
Okay, maybe this is the bean

03:33:30.800 --> 03:33:35.600
Yes, it is the bean. Okay, we can literally go straight back to where we just passed. That's perfect

03:33:37.280 --> 03:33:42.160
They call you a fairy because you're also green. You guys are you guys aren't afraid of heights, right?

03:33:43.040 --> 03:33:45.040
You don't be shy

03:33:45.040 --> 03:33:48.240
Let me just double check. He's not gonna give me a second one

03:33:48.400 --> 03:33:52.800
Yeah, listen, you remember the bean I posted? Yeah, I do. I saw it cool

03:33:53.680 --> 03:33:58.960
Tingle calls you a fairy because anyone he thinks in green is a fairy because he thinks that's cute

03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:01.760
You look like me. You are me

03:34:02.480 --> 03:34:04.240
Right, time to claim

03:34:04.240 --> 03:34:06.240
Let's see what's up here

03:34:06.800 --> 03:34:10.320
Okay, that's a bit dramatic. I have to admit that's a bit much

03:34:11.440 --> 03:34:13.920
Well, there's a heart up here. So I'll take it

03:34:14.720 --> 03:34:20.800
I need I've got three. I've got 200 rupees. I think I'm gonna max out on rupees. I might buy shells in that case

03:34:24.720 --> 03:34:31.120
If we're gonna backtrack should I just 100 guarantee gamba these figures if we're gonna backtrack

03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:34.640
I think we're gonna end up with like tons of shells

03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:40.080
Yeah, I've like wasted a hundred shells with that. We're just gonna do guaranteed pulls

03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:45.280
I shouldn't but if we're gonna backtrack we 100% are gonna get like

03:34:46.400 --> 03:34:49.920
Tons of shells and that was such a waste. Ah, that was such a waste

03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:56.480
Okay, right. Let's see. You want me to do what your back? Yes. I am back. I'm addicted

03:34:57.600 --> 03:35:00.320
How many do I need for 100 probability?

03:35:03.760 --> 03:35:08.640
I'm just gonna do 100 probability because I don't want to gamble like 60 and then not get it

03:35:10.800 --> 03:35:13.680
Let's do 100. Let's do 100. What is it drum roll?

03:35:16.160 --> 03:35:21.760
Fire wizard money gang. I burped when I said that. I don't know if you heard that or the mic may have covered it up

03:35:23.200 --> 03:35:24.480
Okay

03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:28.640
Is there a faster way to do this? No, it's not. I literally have to go all the way up manually

03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:31.520
Big gamba time big gamba

03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:34.160
We're gonna do good

03:35:35.120 --> 03:35:36.720
Okay

03:35:36.720 --> 03:35:40.480
74 so I think we get like six pulls and then we're done

03:35:41.920 --> 03:35:47.760
No burp on the mic. No, I did it as I was talking. So I don't know if the mic even heard it

03:35:49.040 --> 03:35:56.080
One for each percent and yeah, the uh, this is rough. So I'm only gonna get like 10 gacha

03:35:56.880 --> 03:35:58.880
new from it

03:35:59.440 --> 03:36:01.440
I

03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:05.040
Now pull that lever I

03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:13.280
What do the figures do in the game it unlocks a location that we need in order to get 100 percent

03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:16.560
So unfortunately, we're kind of stuck doing this right now

03:36:16.880 --> 03:36:24.480
Um, but we are just gonna get rid of our shells because we're about to backtrack and we'll be rewarded with new

03:36:25.440 --> 03:36:32.800
Um, oh was that 99? I swear if that was 99 and we don't get it

03:36:36.800 --> 03:36:38.800
Okay

03:36:42.960 --> 03:36:48.960
It's too easy it's too easy ladies and gentlemen, you're lucky I refrained

03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:53.040
You're so lucky I refrained

03:36:55.440 --> 03:36:58.720
I I have so much ability to hold it in okay

03:37:00.640 --> 03:37:02.640
All right, let's see

03:37:02.800 --> 03:37:04.800
In that room is the music play

03:37:05.360 --> 03:37:09.200
Let's play in game music. I believe in that room is the music player

03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:16.960
Yeah, we haven't got I don't actually ever recall getting it before you know that

03:37:20.000 --> 03:37:22.000
And

03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:27.760
Oh, you're charging me bro, you are charging me

03:37:29.920 --> 03:37:31.920
77 just for a guarantee

03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:40.240
Happy hearth in oh my god, that's such a lovely name for an in

03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:44.560
I wouldn't mind. Oh my god. Maybe we should develop an in game

03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:49.040
I quite like meta games. I'm really impressed with that. Um

03:37:50.000 --> 03:37:54.800
What's the name the team that put together needy streamer overload. I am so impressed

03:37:54.880 --> 03:37:59.600
I really want to look into them and see to produce anything else. I was blown away by that

03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:03.520
Uh, what game did I really enjoy that? Um

03:38:06.640 --> 03:38:08.640
Um that double shitty game

03:38:09.760 --> 03:38:13.760
Oh, I can't I remember it with the nightclub and I had terrible luck on it buckshot relay

03:38:13.840 --> 03:38:17.680
I was very impressed with buckshot relay. I definitely want to look into the dev team

03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:23.120
Although I think it was made by one guy actually, so it'd be interesting to see what other games he came up with

03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:25.840
Um

03:38:26.960 --> 03:38:28.960
I'm out of shells yet

03:38:32.320 --> 03:38:37.120
Buckshot's just one guy literally need see if he's got anything else on the market though like, um

03:38:38.480 --> 03:38:42.240
Definitely put my money where my mouth is type thing like, um

03:38:43.200 --> 03:38:45.200
The more shells you use yes this thing

03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:48.480
Am I out yet? No. No, I can still get more

03:38:49.600 --> 03:38:54.880
Wow, you lose a hundred percent the same. So this is teaching us go big or go home

03:38:56.400 --> 03:38:59.920
I'm addicted to buckshot after watching I did so bad

03:39:00.640 --> 03:39:03.920
But it was funny though stamp a busy hard-working employee

03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:09.040
Although he can be a touch edgy the stamp he uses his own personal ones. Please don't borrow it. Thanks

03:39:09.760 --> 03:39:13.440
I love like the little details like you didn't have to come up with that lore

03:39:13.520 --> 03:39:16.000
But the game was like, yeah, we're gonna make random lore for these times people

03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:19.280
Are we out shells now?

03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:23.600
No

03:39:24.400 --> 03:39:26.720
80 though, bro a

03:39:28.640 --> 03:39:35.280
Any chance for another buckshot relay stream, uh, most likely a member stream if there's any games we want to revisit

03:39:35.920 --> 03:39:41.360
Um, I'm quite happy to do it in members because if you look it might be a bit like, oh, you've already shamed this before type thing

03:39:42.480 --> 03:39:48.800
She says she'll please Viva pinata and cameo shamelessly to back-to-back endurance rooms. Um

03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:57.840
I think I said I got the achievements on Skyrim working again. So we can actually go back to Skyrim in

03:39:58.560 --> 03:40:00.080
July

03:40:00.080 --> 03:40:01.360
Um

03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:08.400
Oh peaceful high rule car loves peaceful high rule scenery. I don't know who car love is but you've got good taste mate

03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:20.080
Uh, you can just carry 990 max. So 10 is 11 pulls. No crashed warp 100 percent. Oh, I'm not sure I have that kind of skill

03:40:20.960 --> 03:40:26.000
I'm not very good. I don't comprehend. It's a child's game, but I'm I don't think I'm that good

03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:28.000
I

03:40:28.000 --> 03:40:32.240
How does he know about the minute to make figures exactly?

03:40:33.680 --> 03:40:35.680
minister

03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:40.000
Caval is the figure guy. Oh silly me

03:40:41.280 --> 03:40:46.480
Want to try again? I feel like we're now out of shells. We've done quite a lot

03:40:49.600 --> 03:40:51.520
No

03:40:51.520 --> 03:40:54.960
There it is right. Let's do it. Let's just go down to zero shells

03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:58.000
Wish us luck

03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:00.000
What do we pull? What do we pull?

03:41:04.400 --> 03:41:05.920
Malari

03:41:05.920 --> 03:41:08.800
He lives with the seven apprentices in mount carinal

03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:11.440
Serenal

03:41:11.440 --> 03:41:18.000
Carinal which contains all the mineral riches they will ever need. He seems gruff, but he's trustworthy. There we go

03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:23.120
Let's go right. We are officially down and out on shells, which is actually a good thing

03:41:23.760 --> 03:41:32.240
Um, because it means we can now high tweety bird. Um, we can now pick up chests without being worried

03:41:34.160 --> 03:41:36.160
She says as

03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:41.760
Uh, she's full of rupees as well. Can I buy this?

03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:50.320
Why do you keep putting it down speak 200

03:41:53.440 --> 03:41:55.440
Oh

03:41:55.760 --> 03:41:57.760

03:42:01.200 --> 03:42:02.800

03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:05.300
You're lucky. I need to empty my pockets

03:42:05.840 --> 03:42:09.760
That's all i'm saying. You're lucky. I need to empty my pockets because

03:42:10.400 --> 03:42:12.080
30 shells

03:42:12.080 --> 03:42:16.000
Right, bro. That's outrageous honestly. You should be ashamed of yourself

03:42:16.720 --> 03:42:18.720
Oh

03:42:19.440 --> 03:42:21.440
Fair these shells also

Sorry, sorry for what a third tea. I speak the king of the queen's english th 30. Sorry. It's fair in scots

03:42:31.120 --> 03:42:36.000
Capital man even cap I can't escape capitalism in my we video game

03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:40.560
No, wait, no wait, was this the way I came

03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:44.320
It is right. We'll do this then

03:42:45.280 --> 03:42:49.200
200 rupees oh a cheeky cheeky we 30 for me then

03:42:50.400 --> 03:42:52.400
Is there anything under the water? Nah

03:42:53.760 --> 03:42:58.240
Whoop whoop whoop right we are literally just gonna go back to the start and

03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:02.160
Take it from the tap. Oh, we've not unlocked this

03:43:04.160 --> 03:43:10.800
Wow, we've not unlocked it. How well there seems to be something for digging here. Maybe there's a gore rock that we can trade

03:43:10.800 --> 03:43:12.800
I

03:43:16.080 --> 03:43:18.080
Let me be fellow beast

03:43:21.840 --> 03:43:28.000
50 not bad not bad not bad a kinsome piece not bad. Okay. That was a quick one very quick one

03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:30.800
Yeah, it sounds like seven or eight rupees to a shell

03:43:31.440 --> 03:43:34.400
Extortionate well, I know what business we're opening up reflands

03:43:34.960 --> 03:43:37.760
In order to pay for the farm because are you joking me?

03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:43.680
Are you joking me? Is there anything hidden in here anything hidden in here? Nope just a minute

03:43:50.240 --> 03:43:56.320
A red piece I'll absolutely take a red piece. I keep forgetting that the chest can also have

03:43:58.320 --> 03:44:00.320
A other stuff in them

03:44:01.760 --> 03:44:03.760
Kinsome piece

03:44:05.440 --> 03:44:07.440
That's not one shot

03:44:08.480 --> 03:44:10.480
I

03:44:10.800 --> 03:44:12.800
Nothing in here, which is fine

03:44:13.920 --> 03:44:16.080
Right, we'll go we and then we'll go to the minish

03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:20.800
Strone could sell them for more because her pretty cool

03:44:23.280 --> 03:44:25.680
Did the minish sound like naikor when they talk?

03:44:28.240 --> 03:44:33.680
Don't ever type again. That's the funniest thing I've seen all day. That's hilarious, but don't type again

03:44:34.320 --> 03:44:36.320
What the fuck?

03:44:37.120 --> 03:44:41.040
Do they sound like naikor? Oh my god

03:44:42.320 --> 03:44:44.720
That's really funny, but don't talk again

03:44:47.280 --> 03:44:49.280
Leave my squeakers alone

03:44:50.400 --> 03:44:52.400
200 okay, we now have like

03:44:53.600 --> 03:44:56.240
I don't know another two batches of therapy

03:44:58.240 --> 03:45:00.240
Naikor

03:45:00.400 --> 03:45:02.400
Don't speak

03:45:02.480 --> 03:45:04.480
I use the shells first that would add value

03:45:05.200 --> 03:45:10.240
Wait, why is there water unless there's something in the water because why would you put that here?

03:45:13.200 --> 03:45:15.200
No, you didn't there's nothing here

03:45:17.680 --> 03:45:22.480
Am I being trolled why would you put these here if there's nothing in the water?

03:45:25.440 --> 03:45:30.640
I'm being trolled I fell for it have foolish the egg is on my face

03:45:31.600 --> 03:45:34.400
The gamer instincts has failed us truly

03:45:36.880 --> 03:45:42.480
There's something over here. Oh my god. No, he's all alone over here. Are you okay buddy?

03:45:42.880 --> 03:45:47.360
Wow good job finding this place. There aren't many people who visit me. Wait, you don't want to trade or anything

03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:49.520
Is there nothing special? Is it in the water?

03:45:51.040 --> 03:45:56.320
It's in the water, isn't it? It's in the water. Are you sure you don't want to do a kinstone fusion?

03:45:56.720 --> 03:45:58.720
Oh

03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:01.040
What's in the water come on?

03:46:02.240 --> 03:46:04.240
Must be in the water

03:46:13.840 --> 03:46:17.040
Talk to the minish in the barrel shaped house, okay

03:46:17.200 --> 03:46:26.720
Hmm, maybe I unlock a chest at his house or something and we'll come a bit too early

03:46:28.240 --> 03:46:30.240
With our timing

03:46:33.760 --> 03:46:34.960
Hello

03:46:34.960 --> 03:46:38.560
You've heard of the travelers of feng kinstone get really lucky. Well, that's thanks to that

03:46:38.560 --> 03:46:45.200
It's made by husband as you see we thrive on making humans happy. Oh, that's so precious. Hi, buddy

03:46:45.920 --> 03:46:51.040
Sometimes if a flower seed and sometimes it's a stone we hide our lucky items and all sorts of unexpected places

03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:53.040
But the real trick is making it tough for humans

03:46:54.240 --> 03:46:55.840
Kawaii ne

03:46:55.840 --> 03:46:59.520
Relayer, thank you for coming to replaying. I appreciate it. Hi buddy. Hello

03:47:00.080 --> 03:47:05.760
We're doing cutting edge research on bloom. You see that plant with a little bud. We're working on waste and privet

03:47:05.840 --> 03:47:07.840
Do you need water?

03:47:08.800 --> 03:47:10.800
Uh, if you need

03:47:10.960 --> 03:47:14.880
No, okay, that's not real water. Are you real water? Nope. You're not real water

03:47:16.160 --> 03:47:19.760
And there's no water on the side talk to him again. Oh

03:47:22.000 --> 03:47:26.320
What do you mean he doesn't instantly tell me what to do? Oh, I need milk

03:47:27.680 --> 03:47:29.680
You need milk

03:47:29.760 --> 03:47:32.720
Could you have asked me for that before I came all the way to these parts?

03:47:33.360 --> 03:47:36.000
Okay, we'll come back with milk soon to yem, but not yet

03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:42.400
Uh, as far as I'm aware, none of the houses have anything

03:47:43.120 --> 03:47:45.120
And

03:47:45.920 --> 03:47:50.240
I was born and raised here. So I don't know much about those. I hear there are huge green monsters in the woods

03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:53.440
I can't believe they made it through. Oh, I can't believe you made it through their life. That's right

03:47:54.080 --> 03:47:56.080
He needs some azura

03:47:56.800 --> 03:47:58.800
We need some

03:48:00.800 --> 03:48:02.960
So how is old yes, yes, he was fine

03:48:03.520 --> 03:48:09.760
Right, we'll come back to the minish village with milk. What a request. Well, what else do you want sugar while I'm at it?

03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:11.760
I'm at the shops for you milk

03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:14.080
your child

03:48:14.080 --> 03:48:15.280
maybe

03:48:15.280 --> 03:48:19.120
Okay, he does want to fuse that's good. Oh, I should maybe talk to that other one

03:48:19.120 --> 03:48:23.040
He might want to fuse an important piece as well. Can we have yours instead?

03:48:28.080 --> 03:48:30.080
He needs green water from the mountain

03:48:30.240 --> 03:48:34.640
You know what would be great a bomb that went off when you only wanted actually I could make that now. Oh

03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:38.720
Okay, well, we're actually about to go talk to him. Thank you, mate

03:48:39.200 --> 03:48:42.240
I'm gonna talk to the old geezer from over here

03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:46.480
Green liquid as well

03:48:47.920 --> 03:48:49.920
Uh, do you want to trade? No, you don't

03:48:51.440 --> 03:48:53.440
You don't want to trade

03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:00.800
Thank you, thank you

03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:02.400
You have saved me

03:49:02.400 --> 03:49:04.400
Someone calls us that we have a good green

Well again

03:52:21.840 --> 03:52:29.680
Tingling tingle siblings tingle and green and his twin younger brothers ankle and

Knuckle they believe infusing will help meet the fairies

03:52:33.760 --> 03:52:39.920
So they are recording kinsome data on their maps. David junior is not technically a relic stop

03:52:40.560 --> 03:52:43.040
That's bizarre. I love whatever that was

03:52:43.680 --> 03:52:45.920
There's like always not actually related to us. Okay

03:52:47.280 --> 03:52:49.280
Right, let's go get green milk next

03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:53.680
Uh, excuse me pup. Oh, you do this every time buddy

03:53:00.160 --> 03:53:02.160
Oh, there's so much over here we need to

03:53:02.960 --> 03:53:07.520
Do we just do it all at once? Why not? Why not? Why not? We'll just do all at once. Okay

03:53:08.720 --> 03:53:11.760
What's this? Okay, very good very good

03:53:11.840 --> 03:53:13.840
Hmm

03:53:17.920 --> 03:53:19.920
Well, it seems like it's gonna take me down. Oh

03:53:22.320 --> 03:53:24.320
No, no trading

03:53:25.440 --> 03:53:26.960
There is

03:53:26.960 --> 03:53:32.240
Well, I'll grab one now that we're gonna need it at this point in time, but we will come back to get

03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:37.360
Oh, I love this song

03:53:37.520 --> 03:53:40.960
Oh already came back already came back

03:53:44.720 --> 03:53:48.240
All right, there is one here

03:53:55.440 --> 03:54:03.040
Actually, we're gonna check that the the gorgon things aren't here because they might be the

03:54:03.840 --> 03:54:05.840
Kinstone trading that we need to do

03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:08.800
Oh, there is

03:54:09.520 --> 03:54:11.520
Oh, we have 10 pieces of the one they've won

03:54:13.200 --> 03:54:15.200
They all work from home analyst. Yeah

03:54:15.840 --> 03:54:18.880
Although he needs one more friend and he can get to the next location

03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:22.160
Are they all gonna hang out in the cave? Hmm. This wall's pretty tough

03:54:22.160 --> 03:54:25.280
I don't think the two of us can break it, but that doesn't stop me

03:54:29.520 --> 03:54:31.520
Right

03:54:32.240 --> 03:54:34.240
Oh

03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:40.880
I thought I smelled some gorgons around here. What are you guys up to buddy? We miss you. Hey, give us a hand breaking through

03:54:42.320 --> 03:54:46.400
Bunk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk, but they still need one more to break this big wall

03:54:48.320 --> 03:54:54.960
Okay, that's fine. So there's a chest here. We're gonna go get that because we're coming back for it

03:54:58.800 --> 03:55:00.800
Thankfully

03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:05.760
Bit cheeky money so we can put it on our cheeky gacha. Don't mind me. Oh

03:55:08.000 --> 03:55:11.840
Oh speaking of a tingling you were up here hiding from what?

03:55:15.120 --> 03:55:18.640
Do you may perhaps have any other piece for no reason at all?

03:55:19.280 --> 03:55:20.720
Please game

03:55:20.720 --> 03:55:22.320
Please game

03:55:22.320 --> 03:55:25.040
For no other reason at all. Give us something else

03:55:26.160 --> 03:55:28.560
No way that one piece is what I need

03:55:28.640 --> 03:55:34.560
You want to fuse I absolutely do well, I know I have that piece because I just saw it

03:55:35.920 --> 03:55:39.680
Literally out of all the pieces you could ask for should you come in a gambler?

03:55:40.640 --> 03:55:42.640
No

03:55:42.640 --> 03:55:44.640
Just a weeble

03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:01.520
Yeah

03:56:01.920 --> 03:56:05.680

03:56:07.760 --> 03:56:09.760
All those good old

03:56:10.320 --> 03:56:13.840
Yay, they fit I wonder what that means. Oh, yeah, you wonder what it means if they fit together

03:56:14.160 --> 03:56:17.120
Did you ever check out that warrior? No, I didn't do it yet. Please. Please

Bomb the la wait. Do you want to fuse stones? No

03:56:58.320 --> 03:57:00.320

03:57:06.560 --> 03:57:09.600
Okay, thankfully it's not that far away. I think probably already bombed that

Because I'm I'm playing messily. I'm playing messily. Oh my gosh. Goodbye. Don't care. Not my problem

03:57:20.560 --> 03:57:22.560
Not my problem

03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:25.040
Right at least we can do

03:57:27.680 --> 03:57:29.680
You know what these are all in my way

03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:34.480
Absolutely steamrolled. Oh, oh

03:57:36.400 --> 03:57:38.400

03:58:02.400 --> 03:58:04.400
We'll come back to mount cereal later

03:58:05.680 --> 03:58:08.560
Um, this one. Yes

03:58:10.880 --> 03:58:13.140

Oh

03:58:23.120 --> 03:58:25.440
Sorry, I ain't put these on because it's just so much faster

03:58:25.760 --> 03:58:29.440
Look, I don't mean to come through your house with like my dirty shoes and my sword out

03:58:29.520 --> 03:58:34.960
But so it's just so much faster going everywhere. I think the last one is either a red or blue potion. You know what?

03:58:35.680 --> 03:58:38.480
You know what? I've just fucking go all this way

03:58:39.440 --> 03:58:43.280

Nope, they have not bloomed. Okay. Uh, let's try that again. Uh new bloom come back soon

03:59:14.000 --> 03:59:23.120
Okay, I guess we'll do something else

03:59:26.080 --> 03:59:30.400
Needs time but time isn't actually this game isn't actually timed

03:59:34.080 --> 03:59:38.080
It takes five in game minutes, but well if we need

03:59:39.520 --> 03:59:41.920
We'll go to the top of the forest then instead

03:59:44.000 --> 03:59:46.000

04:03:09.120 --> 04:03:13.120
No, okay. Well, there was something down here

04:03:14.400 --> 04:03:16.400
I can't see those

04:03:17.520 --> 04:03:20.960
I can't see if there's an enemy so I'm just like swiping into nothing

04:03:21.840 --> 04:03:23.840
Okay

04:03:24.160 --> 04:03:29.360
Oh, there's a chest. Okay. Okay. It paid off. It paid off. It paid off. Don't worry about it

04:03:34.720 --> 04:03:39.280
Okay, I like that gorgon gorgon gorgon gorgon gorgon

04:03:40.080 --> 04:03:43.840
Sorry, I'm very excited to help see all his buddies come together to help

04:03:44.240 --> 04:03:50.880
It's 10 million runes enough. Alright level up don't don't lose your runes

04:03:52.880 --> 04:03:54.880
Oh, they're gonna do

04:03:54.960 --> 04:03:59.680
They're gonna break a wall. Yes, is there any cheaper doing fall guys? Uh, mercy

04:04:01.760 --> 04:04:07.200
I don't know. I think you showed us some marks on your foot on the swiss room. Yeah, that's gym

04:04:08.640 --> 04:04:10.240
That's for

04:04:10.240 --> 04:04:13.280
Stimulian not in that way. That's like for

04:04:14.400 --> 04:04:20.400
Stamming on my feet. I have permanent scars on my ill-fee bows because of that. That's just me

04:04:21.440 --> 04:04:27.200
Uh, right, that was good. We went this way now. We just need to go up and then we have finished whatever location this is

04:04:28.560 --> 04:04:34.160
T-minus five hours for mercy. Can I complete the game in five hours and 100% it? I actually do not know

04:04:35.120 --> 04:04:37.120
Wow, this is a big cavern

04:04:37.760 --> 04:04:42.240
Big cavern. We should have picked up them butterflies that sped things up a bit

04:04:43.040 --> 04:04:45.200
Where is this that want to come out here?

04:04:46.320 --> 04:04:49.360
Oh, I I want to come out here. Thank you

04:04:51.040 --> 04:04:53.040
Like this just in case you fall in the water

04:04:54.160 --> 04:04:56.160
Must be

04:04:58.160 --> 04:05:02.400
Yeah, okay, there's nothing hitting the wall. Wow. Okay, that was good. I like that

04:05:03.360 --> 04:05:05.760
Any other child you want to play in the future?

04:05:05.920 --> 04:05:12.320
Um, cameo and viva pinata are coming up in july. I'm going to focus on getting a butt ton of gamer score

04:05:13.120 --> 04:05:14.480
um

04:05:14.480 --> 04:05:16.480
So it will take me a hot second to

04:05:17.200 --> 04:05:19.520
Get that where the heck are we going?

04:05:20.320 --> 04:05:22.320
We're going so long

04:05:23.920 --> 04:05:25.920
Is it stairwell?

04:05:26.800 --> 04:05:29.440
No, it's a chest. What is it? What's inside?

04:05:30.080 --> 04:05:34.720
Okay, I'll take the shells because we do need them. So I'm not that mad. Okay. I'm not that mad

04:05:37.040 --> 04:05:39.600
Castle crashers could definitely see that

04:05:40.800 --> 04:05:45.760
We've got a four man collab coming up. Um on uno

04:05:47.040 --> 04:05:48.720
um

04:05:48.720 --> 04:05:50.720
And then I think emmy broke the news

04:05:52.560 --> 04:05:54.560
If I'm not mistaken

04:05:55.120 --> 04:05:58.960
Question mark, hopefully should it break the news or I'm breaking the news and it's not really meant to break

04:05:59.680 --> 04:06:05.200
Um, oh, that'll be the freaking piece that strip it hanging. Um

04:06:07.520 --> 04:06:09.520
So did I go up there as a wean?

04:06:11.280 --> 04:06:13.280
Oh, did I go in here?

04:06:15.600 --> 04:06:17.600
Can't get me no

04:06:18.880 --> 04:06:20.880
Oh, I've already been in here. Okay

04:06:21.760 --> 04:06:28.720
Oh, keep talking nobody explodes can be fun. That is not a game for me. I tried it, but I'm like

04:06:31.200 --> 04:06:35.760
Different strokes for different folks. Oh, whoa steady on refunds

04:06:37.920 --> 04:06:40.320
Yeah, what's this? Can I train with you? Yeah

04:06:41.280 --> 04:06:43.280
Are you the one that rejected me?

04:06:43.360 --> 04:06:47.200
I you have found if you train with me. Would you like to train? Yes

04:06:47.760 --> 04:06:51.200
We're gonna learn something new now. You will learn a dangerous technique for day

04:06:51.680 --> 04:06:57.840
The peril beam first you must have only one heart second use your last and some strength and swing your sword. That's it

04:06:58.320 --> 04:07:00.160
Yes, I understand

04:07:00.160 --> 04:07:03.440
So there's no turning back for one must feel the technique

04:07:04.960 --> 04:07:06.960
Position

04:07:10.400 --> 04:07:15.200
Oh, so it comes back if I'm on one health, okay, I comprehend

04:07:15.760 --> 04:07:23.760
Okay, we've got another scroll. That's good. That's good. What do you need? Oh something new something new

04:07:29.360 --> 04:07:35.680
Oh, where's that top left before the grave area

04:07:35.920 --> 04:07:41.360
What's in say North Hyrule Field, yeah

04:07:42.560 --> 04:07:46.960
Okay, do you trade anymore or teach me anymore or is that you taught me everything, you know

04:07:47.920 --> 04:07:53.040
Now there's nothing more I can teach you. Okay. There is one in the swamp that can teach us something

04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:57.360
All right, we are just gonna jump in the water

04:07:58.880 --> 04:08:00.720
We grab

04:08:00.720 --> 04:08:03.760
As if that thing just aim bought on the arse

04:08:06.240 --> 04:08:08.240
Oh

04:08:12.480 --> 04:08:14.480
I'm trying to remember

04:08:17.760 --> 04:08:19.760
Have we done this properly

04:08:21.840 --> 04:08:29.440
Max health or one. Yeah below limit do that sort of thing now. I know this is how we got to this location

04:08:30.160 --> 04:08:32.160
But

04:08:35.200 --> 04:08:38.080
I just want to check there's not a gorgon tree

04:08:39.840 --> 04:08:41.840
Stop

04:08:42.000 --> 04:08:46.560
Wrapping me up. Uh, okay, so we have done it in this area

04:08:47.920 --> 04:08:52.720
So we just need to know is that the only one in this area then?

04:08:54.320 --> 04:08:56.320
Will this be a chest?

04:08:56.320 --> 04:08:58.320
Yeah, okay chest

04:09:00.080 --> 04:09:04.960
Um, wait, am I losing it?

04:09:09.200 --> 04:09:13.760
Am I losing it? I think I'm losing it. Oh, well, whatever. Uh, we've already traded the gorgons

04:09:13.760 --> 04:09:19.520
We don't need to anything else in here. Uh, we'll go small and navigate the map as a wee one

04:09:22.080 --> 04:09:28.160
Uh, we'll just double check this little minish in here. Is there a minish in here?

04:09:30.080 --> 04:09:32.080
I

04:09:32.400 --> 04:09:35.600
Forget that we can swim so I don't need to deal with that lily pad anymore

04:09:39.520 --> 04:09:44.240
Famous last words bro famous last words don't kill us

04:09:46.880 --> 04:09:50.640
Oh, but we need to make triple quadruple sure because if we win a hundred percent in the game

04:09:50.640 --> 04:09:52.640
We need to go all the way and uh

04:09:53.680 --> 04:09:56.720
At least I can swim back and I don't need to deal with it

04:09:57.680 --> 04:09:59.680
But over there yeah, jeez

04:10:00.480 --> 04:10:02.480
There we go. Was there

04:10:03.760 --> 04:10:06.640
No, there's literally not even a minish here, so I've wasted my time

04:10:08.320 --> 04:10:10.320
Okay, we can do this at least

04:10:11.920 --> 04:10:15.200
Oh, you have got to be absolutely kidding me

04:10:17.040 --> 04:10:19.040
They did that to me twice

04:10:19.520 --> 04:10:21.520
They do this to me every time

04:10:22.160 --> 04:10:24.160
Oh

04:10:24.480 --> 04:10:26.480
Now we may have already done

04:10:27.040 --> 04:10:29.520
I think I've actually already done whatever this is up ahead

04:10:30.080 --> 04:10:32.240
But just to make sure just to make sure

04:10:32.720 --> 04:10:36.720
Oh, no, no, no, okay. Thanks. Thanks for no thanks already done it

04:10:38.080 --> 04:10:40.080
All right, let me just go back

04:10:40.480 --> 04:10:43.920
Oh my god, I love that. I'm like a tiny little speck on the screen as well

04:10:45.440 --> 04:10:49.360
Did we do the one that's over here?

04:10:52.240 --> 04:10:54.240
Wait, was there not one over here?

04:10:57.840 --> 04:10:59.840
I'm going crazy

04:11:08.320 --> 04:11:12.720
We already did this one just to make triple sure

04:11:14.080 --> 04:11:16.080
Okay, did you want to fuse

04:11:17.520 --> 04:11:19.840
You hear it steal my bean aren't you?

04:11:21.840 --> 04:11:23.840
It's yours

04:11:25.520 --> 04:11:28.320
Um, I thought is it this side?

04:11:32.160 --> 04:11:37.920
Oh, yeah, we've not done this we didn't have the light source what we do now

04:11:42.880 --> 04:11:44.880
Oh, ah

04:11:48.720 --> 04:11:50.720
All right

04:11:52.480 --> 04:11:55.680
Do not fall off because it takes me like half an hour to get back up

04:12:00.320 --> 04:12:05.760
Okay, not bad not bad. I like this cave. I like this cave because it's not difficult. I like it

04:12:06.400 --> 04:12:08.400
I guess a kingstone piece

04:12:08.400 --> 04:12:10.880
Uh, it'll be important. It'll be important. That's fine

04:12:11.840 --> 04:12:16.560
Right, why would you give me water if there's nothing hidden in here? Hmm, but there's nothing in here

04:12:22.240 --> 04:12:24.240
Red red

04:12:26.000 --> 04:12:30.400
Oh, right. Okay. So we've got that kingstone piece. I'm sure it means we can do something

04:12:31.040 --> 04:12:33.040
Get bean done. How dare you

04:12:33.840 --> 04:12:35.840
I'm guessing I can oh I can

04:12:36.480 --> 04:12:39.840
Am I supposed to be no, I was gonna say I don't think I'm supposed to be tiny here

04:12:44.320 --> 04:12:50.240
All right, I can't go up there. I've just been there. I've been there. Wasn't there something bottom left? Am I losing it?

04:12:51.520 --> 04:12:53.520
I

04:12:55.040 --> 04:12:57.040
There's a crack there

04:12:57.920 --> 04:12:59.920
How would I get to the crack?

04:13:01.200 --> 04:13:06.080
Up here. No, I can't take the stairs. I'm too weak for the stairs. Sorry

04:13:08.160 --> 04:13:11.440
Well, I'm about as ready as I can possibly see for shadow the earth tree

04:13:12.480 --> 04:13:17.680
And I've already been there. I can't take the stairs right. I think I've done everything I possibly can in this area

04:13:18.480 --> 04:13:20.480
Which I'm fine with

04:13:21.520 --> 04:13:23.520
You could do

04:13:26.640 --> 04:13:28.640
Am I sure that's everything I can do though

04:13:29.920 --> 04:13:34.400
Oh, I feel like I'm missing something but whoa, I don't know

04:13:36.800 --> 04:13:42.080
Uh, then he can what I'm missing but it's okay. It's okay. We'll get through it

04:13:42.080 --> 04:13:44.080
Okay

04:13:52.080 --> 04:13:54.880
Oh, we need to explore long long ranch which I've no done

04:13:55.920 --> 04:13:58.080
Oh, we need to explore the whole map which I've no done

04:14:01.440 --> 04:14:06.480
Oh, there's the tingling there. How'd I get to you on the ranch? I need to go in the ram ranch

04:14:06.800 --> 04:14:08.800
But

04:14:10.400 --> 04:14:18.480
What does going small do it puts me in there, but I don't need that you guys have hearts. Oh, you do actually surprisingly

04:14:22.160 --> 04:14:25.600
Uh, I've not done mount serially

04:14:29.120 --> 04:14:31.120
Hmm

04:14:31.120 --> 04:14:34.800
I oh I've already done this. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's fine. Um

04:14:37.440 --> 04:14:40.960
Ah, okay. Okay, we're getting somewhere we're getting somewhere

04:14:42.800 --> 04:14:44.800
Something new

04:14:46.080 --> 04:14:48.080
I'm so cute in pixel form

04:14:49.840 --> 04:14:51.440
Whoopsies

04:14:51.440 --> 04:14:54.720
Okay, red. Perfect. We need it for future trees

04:14:55.360 --> 04:15:01.440
And art you never have three. I need one more. Oh, that's fantastic. Oh, those are the worms

04:15:02.960 --> 04:15:04.960
That's the first time I've ever seen the dang one

04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:08.720
Uh, I assume

04:15:11.280 --> 04:15:15.120
Yes, sorry my stomach just internally farted if you heard that one

04:15:16.240 --> 04:15:18.960
Yeah, you like that. You like hearing my stomach internally farting

04:15:20.960 --> 04:15:26.320
Are you gonna move mister? You know what puddle of water in the middle of the pasture. There's something hidden under it. Yes

04:15:27.760 --> 04:15:29.760
Are you gonna get out of the way? Thank you

04:15:30.800 --> 04:15:32.800
Thank you

04:15:33.760 --> 04:15:38.240
Okay, I think if I talk to this cow there has to be a kinstone piece because why would the game want me to come

04:15:38.240 --> 04:15:43.040
All the way over. Oh, that was too close. I thought I'd be ground chuck for sure. Wait

04:15:44.320 --> 04:15:46.320
Oh, I can't do anything

04:15:48.240 --> 04:15:54.080
That's it. I'm picking up this pot and throwing out when I'm tiny. Wait, so there was a waste of I didn't need to do any of this

04:15:55.440 --> 04:15:58.800
Oh, well. Oh, well, we tried we tried. What's this?

04:15:59.760 --> 04:16:02.000
Water dish that we can swim through baby

04:16:03.200 --> 04:16:08.960
Is there like anything not that's a dead end right? Okay cows. Don't block me. I'm just trying to get back, okay

04:16:10.160 --> 04:16:11.920
I said don't

04:16:11.920 --> 04:16:15.040
Don't do it. I have to wait on this cow moving away

04:16:16.240 --> 04:16:18.240
Yes. Yes. Keep going

04:16:19.280 --> 04:16:21.280
I'll bite your ankles like a herder

04:16:28.400 --> 04:16:30.960
Oh my god, is there a high she's a goat

04:16:31.920 --> 04:16:36.880
He's stinky. Oh, I've already done that. But is this not how I get up to that tingle up there?

04:16:39.760 --> 04:16:41.760
Yes, it is how I get up to that tingle

04:16:46.480 --> 04:16:48.480
Oh my god, that was lucky

04:16:50.800 --> 04:16:52.800
No, no, that's stinky

04:16:53.360 --> 04:16:57.680
Right, if we can get more green we can go back to the original tingle

04:16:57.920 --> 04:17:01.040
And then we've unlocked whatever that is

04:17:01.680 --> 04:17:09.040
Because there's one more. Can I get green please? No, okay. I guess it. Oh, no. Wait, hold on. It's faster just to jump off the map

04:17:10.160 --> 04:17:12.640
Yeah, jump off the site not off the map

04:17:13.520 --> 04:17:16.160
Please don't participate in any dangerous behaviors

04:17:18.480 --> 04:17:24.320
All right, isn't there something up here I need to possibly high probability I think

04:17:25.280 --> 04:17:30.640
Go we and go across the bridge sure say no more fam

04:17:32.720 --> 04:17:39.200
What are is the cross here? There's a hole in the ground. Hello. Okay, where are you here?

04:17:41.520 --> 04:17:44.160
I'm getting a bit Confucius, you know

04:17:45.600 --> 04:17:47.600
Call me a philosopher

04:17:48.480 --> 04:17:58.080
And I assume the whirlwind is just to get over here. Is there anything special over here though?

04:18:00.640 --> 04:18:03.040
Not really. I'm seeing

04:18:04.720 --> 04:18:11.520
No, let's just to get over there. Okay. I think we've done what we can in this immediate vicinity

04:18:13.360 --> 04:18:15.360
Unless

04:18:16.000 --> 04:18:18.000

50 perfect. We actually might need to go to town because we're already at 600 coins again

04:19:21.120 --> 04:19:23.120
All because of our

04:19:24.320 --> 04:19:26.320
Journey

04:19:26.320 --> 04:19:31.760
Yeah, unfortunately didn't unlock the old waterfall here. So that's a definitely come back to moment

Um, let's get the Pegasus boots on so we can get that heck out here

04:19:48.800 --> 04:19:51.520
Did I trade with the guy up here?

04:19:53.520 --> 04:19:55.600
Uh, I am very tempted you

04:19:59.520 --> 04:20:02.960

That was lucky that was lucky. I was like great another one that I don't have the thing for

04:20:13.280 --> 04:20:15.280
A swamp again

04:20:15.920 --> 04:20:19.280
There is so much happening at the swamp. I'm not even kidding

04:20:20.240 --> 04:20:25.520
So so much. I think we're gonna have to buy green keystone pieces in town as well because this is getting a bit

04:20:26.560 --> 04:20:31.280
It's getting a bit difficult trying to you know, I keep everyone happy

04:20:32.240 --> 04:20:34.240
It's not working

04:20:35.200 --> 04:20:41.280
Uh, because Tingling's asking for stuff I didn't have what is even in me

04:20:41.840 --> 04:20:43.840

We believe in you you can do it. Oh, yeah

04:20:47.280 --> 04:20:48.960

Oh, how much have we got now? Oh, right. We're get we're gamma time gamma time gamma time

04:20:54.240 --> 04:20:56.240
We can get six more figurines

04:20:56.960 --> 04:21:02.800
Uh, I don't think this is the one that I've been in six more figurines

04:21:05.360 --> 04:21:07.840
And I can see all the red

04:21:09.200 --> 04:21:13.120
Did I hear gamma speak a hundred percent of the game? Are there achievements?

04:21:13.600 --> 04:21:17.760
Are there any achievements for a hundred percent? No, this is like old game

04:21:18.400 --> 04:21:20.880
That doesn't do that kind of stuff for you theories

04:21:22.000 --> 04:21:24.000
Uh, I'll grab one of you. Sorry

04:21:24.880 --> 04:21:30.320
Oh, no, I said I'll grab one of you. Is that a grab? Yes. Thank you. Yeah, we do need a cheeky grab

04:21:31.040 --> 04:21:35.200
My apologies. Uh, I might not be that fun being in a jar, but then again

04:21:40.000 --> 04:21:42.000
That's all I'm gonna say tea

04:21:42.000 --> 04:21:45.920
I've not unlocked those two areas. So there's not even a point in going down

04:21:47.200 --> 04:21:49.200
Ah, I've not unlocked it

04:21:50.400 --> 04:21:51.840
Not unlocked it

04:21:51.840 --> 04:21:57.840
All right, we will now do mount cereal after we hit the tune lads. We're going gambling on the tune

04:21:59.440 --> 04:22:05.840

Wait, he doesn't restock

04:22:12.560 --> 04:22:15.440
He doesn't restock unless I buy all the kin stones

04:22:16.560 --> 04:22:18.560
I thought he would constantly restock

04:22:19.760 --> 04:22:21.760
Sorry, but I'm here for the gacha

04:22:22.080 --> 04:22:24.080
Give me another hundred of these

Why does he even want the shells? I don't know

04:23:52.880 --> 04:23:54.880
Some people like collecting things

04:23:54.960 --> 04:24:00.080

04:24:18.720 --> 04:24:20.720
Oh no

04:24:21.280 --> 04:24:24.080
It might be it might be look for bread time

04:24:25.120 --> 04:24:28.400
Hold on a minute instead of that so raven i'm getting a vision that

04:24:29.120 --> 04:24:33.120
Wait a minute guys. I'm getting some bodily function movements internally

04:24:35.680 --> 04:24:40.800
It's not looking good. I can't believe it. I might need a I need a cheeky break. I might need a cheeky break

04:24:40.800 --> 04:24:42.800
I think it might be a loafer clock

04:24:43.920 --> 04:24:45.920
Uh

04:24:50.480 --> 04:24:52.480
What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that?

04:24:53.440 --> 04:24:58.080
See some of each of us do an idol meeting here we drop loaves of bread

04:25:00.800 --> 04:25:06.800
Uh, I don't know how you're uh, you know, there's other euphemisms such as dropping the kids off at the pool

04:25:06.800 --> 04:25:12.800
I have heard that 14 percent. This is this probability is dropping fast

04:25:14.640 --> 04:25:17.280
Yes, I want to trade for a hundred percent guarantee

04:25:17.840 --> 04:25:19.840
Wearing flowers

This is me wishing my gacha had a function to put more tickets in

04:25:24.640 --> 04:25:26.640
I mean

04:25:26.960 --> 04:25:32.080
Technically, that's why gacha is gacha the more money you put in the more likely you are to like win

04:25:32.160 --> 04:25:34.480
Oh my god, I just want an internal fart if you hear that

04:25:35.360 --> 04:25:40.320
Uh, I think that loafer bread's coming faster than I first anticipated ladies and gentlemen

04:25:41.200 --> 04:25:42.640

04:26:11.920 --> 04:26:16.400
Oh, no, that's not how it works. Just because the Chinese is shot. He doesn't even give me money

04:26:16.640 --> 04:26:21.920
Uh, yeah, but anyway, uh, we're gonna go for a bio hazard break. Do excuse me. Uh, should be a couple of cheeky minutes

04:26:22.000 --> 04:26:25.600

Why are you giving me money for going for a job? What's going on here? Now hold on a minute. Hold on a minute

04:36:46.000 --> 04:36:50.320
I've made a cup of tea. I was very unsuccessful in my endeavors

04:36:50.640 --> 04:36:57.440
Um, however, I think I've probably done one of the biggest wraps in a very long time

04:36:58.560 --> 04:37:00.560
Um, I've got a cup of tea

04:37:01.520 --> 04:37:04.640
Um, I've had to leave my door open

04:37:05.440 --> 04:37:08.080
Because gimley is now losing her absolute mind

I don't know if people will come in but if you if you hear paper paper

If you hear plastic rustling, she's found plastic to chew on which on the rip off of her and spank her out there

04:37:19.520 --> 04:37:20.880

Okay, one more one more. Yes. Yes. Yes one more probably

Haha, please do not roleplay like that. Okay

Um, as long as you're having fun, you can just post the water emoji for free. How about that?

04:37:44.640 --> 04:37:49.520
The braptuber. No, we're we're still peeler at this stage. Honestly

04:37:50.320 --> 04:37:53.840
I might add to it. I'm tempted to add to it. Oh, that's one of the

04:37:54.560 --> 04:38:00.320
Fantasies I should actually mention. What were we doing? I think we're going mount cereal, aren't we?

04:38:00.960 --> 04:38:02.960
Yeah, we are

04:38:03.120 --> 04:38:05.120
Mount cereal

04:38:13.120 --> 04:38:15.120
Thank you

04:38:16.240 --> 04:38:20.800
As long as it doesn't come beam in your stop, that's literally what it would be called as well

04:38:21.680 --> 04:38:24.480
Right, we're gonna take mount cereal

04:38:25.280 --> 04:38:27.760
cereal. I know it's not cereal, but it's

04:38:31.680 --> 04:38:33.040
Don't jump on me

04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:38.320
Uh, right. I've already done that, so you don't need to worry about that

04:38:43.040 --> 04:38:48.080
If that's the shortcut down, I assume I've already nuked whoever's in here

04:38:49.600 --> 04:38:54.240
Uh, so much fun. Oh wait, I've not been in here. Did I run out? Maybe I didn't have enough bombs at the time

04:38:54.960 --> 04:39:00.720
I'll take the money though. Fine tens. Poor things have been stuck in that cave. First thing I do is take one of their friends and leave

04:39:01.680 --> 04:39:09.280
Uh, I'm just checking if there's anything that looks like I need to bomb at or something

04:39:11.200 --> 04:39:14.880
Hmm, not that my elf I see. Havern

04:39:16.800 --> 04:39:18.800
Daverny Davern

04:39:19.440 --> 04:39:25.200
What about yellow super chat? Oh is that one? I cannot trade. No, sorry. I don't need any bombs

Right, actually, I may just claim to the it seems like it's going to be like way faster just to claim the hill

04:39:48.000 --> 04:39:53.280
Absolutely ruled that guy by accident. Oh, you can shortcut with the rot. Yeah

04:39:53.600 --> 04:39:55.600
Yeah

04:39:57.120 --> 04:39:59.120
There was a cavern that I couldn't do

04:40:00.480 --> 04:40:05.520
I thought this would work. Or is this just how I'm supposed to actually, no, it must be the other cavern. Sorry

04:40:06.720 --> 04:40:11.920
There was a cavern that we needed to explore with an item that I didn't have yet

04:40:12.800 --> 04:40:17.280
If I need an else this guy, oh our cults groups. Damn, shoot me off. This one

04:40:18.720 --> 04:40:20.720
I'm pretty sure it's a cave

04:40:21.200 --> 04:40:23.200
No

04:40:24.240 --> 04:40:26.240
This cave?

04:40:26.880 --> 04:40:31.040
Short cut to the bomb. So then what's this? Wasn't there no a cave like?

04:40:33.760 --> 04:40:41.280
Is it this? Yes, it was this. Oh one of the four tails apart. Yeah

04:40:42.320 --> 04:40:47.680
Oh sugar. Oh my god. Oh, it's behind the door

04:40:47.920 --> 04:40:49.920
Oh

04:40:51.440 --> 04:40:53.440
And things

04:40:59.840 --> 04:41:02.880
And he's got a special kind stone for us. Let's go

04:41:04.000 --> 04:41:06.000
His name is gray blade

04:41:06.560 --> 04:41:14.320
What does he unlock for us the water falling the swamp? Yeah, we're hitting up the swamp next because we're pretty much done everything in the dang swamp

04:41:15.280 --> 04:41:17.280
Um

04:41:18.880 --> 04:41:21.040
Yeah, you've missed a lot of bomb spots monkeys

04:41:21.920 --> 04:41:25.840
Believe it or not. I'm gray blade and I'm a train. Would you like to train? Yes

04:41:26.960 --> 04:41:31.840
You will learn the roll attack roll and then as soon as you get up scream. Hiya

04:41:33.120 --> 04:41:35.120
Yes, I understand

04:41:36.080 --> 04:41:38.800
But one must feel the technique position

04:41:39.360 --> 04:41:41.360
Oh

04:41:42.960 --> 04:41:46.160
Wow charge attack. Okay. Okay. We'll charge. I like that

04:41:47.040 --> 04:41:50.640
Wait, oh, that's so good. That's a good one. I like that

04:41:52.160 --> 04:41:58.080
We've got the roll attack. Is that all you can teach me master gray blades. I think it is that cat

04:41:59.040 --> 04:42:01.040
Hi, gimli. Do you want to say hi?

04:42:01.360 --> 04:42:05.040
There's nothing left to teach. Okay. Do you want to see do you want to meow?

04:42:05.760 --> 04:42:08.480
Oh, she she doesn't really talk

04:42:09.040 --> 04:42:11.280
Uh, gimli and viva actually don't talk at all

04:42:12.000 --> 04:42:17.440
I know that think about it. You guys like never meow. Um a bit concerning. Should I be worried darlin?

04:42:18.320 --> 04:42:21.520
Do you want to do kinton? No, you don't that's okay. You don't have to

04:42:23.360 --> 04:42:30.960
Uh, whoops, I probably could use that saying but hey ho. Hi gimli. Are you happy to be in the stream?

04:42:31.520 --> 04:42:34.640
Oh, are you all excited to be in the stream?

04:42:35.600 --> 04:42:39.760
You're not supposed to be here. You're not baby girl. We can't help it

04:42:40.880 --> 04:42:45.520
Oh, she she's on the floor doing the little claw thing. Um

04:42:48.800 --> 04:42:53.760
What else is there? I'm sure on the actual mount that we have to claim there is like something on this

04:42:54.640 --> 04:42:56.640
That is my yes

04:42:57.040 --> 04:43:01.040
Pets for gimli. Oh, they're petting you gimli. The reef ones are petting you darlin

04:43:02.720 --> 04:43:07.200
Okay, we need the wall because there was like loads of stuff. I know I probably should do that

04:43:09.600 --> 04:43:15.760
Watch out for falling. Oh, what are you doing? Oh, you climbed my chair. Oh, no, don't play. Don't not with the wires

04:43:16.160 --> 04:43:20.320
This is when this is when I have to take you out the room because you start playing with the wires

04:43:20.320 --> 04:43:22.640
That's not it's not what those are for gimli

04:43:22.640 --> 04:43:24.640
I

04:43:25.840 --> 04:43:32.000
Rollin around on the floor like crazy right now. She's so happy to be in the stream room. You're late in the stream

04:43:33.760 --> 04:43:36.240
Because you might you might do something like

04:43:40.880 --> 04:43:46.080
Is that all we unlock? No, there was a guy up here wasn't there was we need to treat him like that

04:43:46.240 --> 04:43:48.240
Oh

04:43:48.480 --> 04:43:49.840
Wires are so fun though

04:43:49.840 --> 04:43:54.960
Literally emmy and her emmy told me her rats like to chew through everything. I'm like, better not chew through. You're done

04:43:55.040 --> 04:43:57.040
3d. Oh

Oh, no, don't no, no, no, no the table darlin. No, you can't be on the the jump down. Okay jump down

04:44:02.800 --> 04:44:09.120
Right, so either sit behind me on the chair or jump that right. Hold on. No, she's done. She's done. Sorry

04:44:09.280 --> 04:44:11.280
She's

04:44:13.360 --> 04:44:15.360
Good girl

04:44:15.360 --> 04:44:18.880
Got him pranked him. She thought I was coming with you

04:44:19.360 --> 04:44:26.240
But pranked her. Yeah, sorry. She she was jumping on the table and I'm like, I can't I can't I can't have you on the table darlin

04:44:26.800 --> 04:44:29.280
Absolutely pranked. So sorry gimli's but

04:44:30.000 --> 04:44:32.000
It is what it is

04:44:32.560 --> 04:44:36.160
We should not banished for bad behavior or anything. She did banish because I can't have her

04:44:36.400 --> 04:44:39.760
Oh, I see it. I see it a heart a heart a heart

04:44:40.640 --> 04:44:45.920
Okay, I'm not going that way. Ha ha. We'll go this way. We'll go this way because I can't deal with other one

04:44:47.520 --> 04:44:51.200
Uh guru guru guru no guru

04:44:55.520 --> 04:44:57.520
Look at this skill

04:44:57.680 --> 04:45:00.720
Look at that skill and bait and can't can't get enough from the piece

04:45:01.360 --> 04:45:04.160
Take a piece of my heart now, baby

04:45:04.160 --> 04:45:06.160
I

04:45:06.960 --> 04:45:08.960
Banished right then

04:45:08.960 --> 04:45:11.920
Did you teach? Oh, no, I don't teach cats that trick cats are

04:45:12.640 --> 04:45:13.840
Uh

04:45:13.840 --> 04:45:15.680
They don't need to be oh

04:45:15.680 --> 04:45:20.560
I cannot believe I didn't know you could wallop those. I thought they were just like a paramount enemy

04:45:21.040 --> 04:45:23.040
That's so silly

04:45:24.720 --> 04:45:29.760
Uh, but no, I never taught my putters any twigs. I don't uh, I don't know they're

04:45:30.320 --> 04:45:32.640
They're cats really performative animals

04:45:34.560 --> 04:45:35.840
Um

04:45:35.840 --> 04:45:39.200
I have had to teach them to let me pick them up. So

04:45:40.160 --> 04:45:41.440
I was

04:45:41.440 --> 04:45:46.720
Had a weird like stance of like, oh, I won't pick up my cat because they don't like it type thing

04:45:47.280 --> 04:45:52.560
But then I realized if there was ever an emergency I need them to be able to leap into my arms

04:45:53.360 --> 04:45:57.120
Um, thankfully no emergency is ever occurred. Well other than

04:45:57.840 --> 04:46:00.720
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This is exactly what we want

04:46:02.880 --> 04:46:06.000
I'd a cat that leads play bitch. Yeah, teach me to come on. Come on

04:46:07.200 --> 04:46:09.200
You want to teach me to do that?

04:46:11.680 --> 04:46:17.920
There's a solid wall no doubt about it. Is this the last one we've unlocked a chest of some sort

04:46:21.600 --> 04:46:24.160
I got a brother and a sister cat recently and there are

04:46:24.720 --> 04:46:29.920
Uh, they are too keen on getting held. Oh, they aren't no it takes it takes a long time for a cat

04:46:30.160 --> 04:46:36.720
If you think of it imagine something eight times your size picking you up like it's quite it's quite a lot

04:46:37.520 --> 04:46:39.520
But over time over time

04:46:41.280 --> 04:46:43.760
There's normally only one pair of caverns

04:46:47.040 --> 04:46:49.040
Anything else

04:46:49.360 --> 04:46:51.360
Oh

04:46:52.880 --> 04:46:54.880
Yes, but you have to teach us to

04:46:55.280 --> 04:46:57.040
H3o

04:46:57.040 --> 04:46:58.640
H3o

04:46:58.640 --> 04:47:01.840
H, you know H3o is technically right. Hello

04:47:03.120 --> 04:47:05.120
I'm the hermit

04:47:08.400 --> 04:47:12.800
Do you do anything else? No, okay. He just sits here. He's just happy to be here

04:47:13.440 --> 04:47:19.280
Um, I think that's all we can do on the mountain because up ahead is like actual like quest and stuff

04:47:19.840 --> 04:47:21.840
We've already seen the fairy

04:47:24.080 --> 04:47:26.880
So I guess we'll go to the swamp already. Yeah

04:47:31.760 --> 04:47:33.760
All right

04:47:36.960 --> 04:47:39.440
Okay, now that we can swim

04:47:40.400 --> 04:47:42.400
Okay, this is just a snake room

04:47:44.240 --> 04:47:48.720
If only you were eight times my size, I'll wait until you hear about a zoo's lore

04:47:49.520 --> 04:47:51.520
Okay, there's a little thing here

04:47:53.520 --> 04:47:55.520
Back in the tiny

04:47:57.920 --> 04:48:00.800
Oh, this is a vast map though

04:48:01.920 --> 04:48:06.480
Oh a booty fly you call a joy you can now dig faster than before

04:48:06.640 --> 04:48:07.760
Are you squid mirroring?

04:48:07.760 --> 04:48:09.600
Curious

04:48:09.600 --> 04:48:12.640
I am rewatching the member stream of the forbidden tail list

04:48:13.200 --> 04:48:19.920
I didn't realize you had a gen 2 commission waiting. I already tipped on it, but here is some extra chocolate luck

04:48:21.840 --> 04:48:23.840
Wait, what?

04:48:24.880 --> 04:48:32.800
500 am I I need my glasses on unironically where my is that actually say 500 or are you fucking trolling right now?

04:48:32.800 --> 04:48:36.800
Holy shit, what the fuck?

04:48:38.640 --> 04:48:46.000
500 that are for love. Thank you. Hello. What the ink literally what the ink?

04:48:47.520 --> 04:48:49.520
500

04:48:51.440 --> 04:48:53.440
Um, I've kind of

04:48:53.520 --> 04:48:59.200
I've said this before I'm happy to fucking hell 500. Thank you. Jesus

04:48:59.920 --> 04:49:01.440
um

04:49:01.440 --> 04:49:03.440
I have said this before

04:49:03.440 --> 04:49:09.440
But basically we make a route a racially and this is terrible. This is the only way you can describe it

04:49:10.160 --> 04:49:13.040
We make a racially ambiguous person and then

04:49:13.760 --> 04:49:18.000
And then we can chocolate fire them if they're chocolate because you can't have a white chick on a chocolate

04:49:18.720 --> 04:49:20.720
But you can have a chocolate on a white chick

04:49:21.040 --> 04:49:23.040
Example she be chocolate

04:49:23.680 --> 04:49:26.240
But she be she be she be's cooking

04:49:27.280 --> 04:49:28.480
um

04:49:28.480 --> 04:49:31.600
Holy sugar. Ah, that is a lot of money. Thank you

04:49:33.360 --> 04:49:36.080
No, it's true. No, it's true. It's true. It's true

04:49:37.520 --> 04:49:41.680
You can't have a white chick on a chocolate, but you can have a chocolate on a white chick, you know what I mean

04:49:42.880 --> 04:49:45.280
Surely that makes sense. That was a sense, right?

04:49:46.720 --> 04:49:49.280
Uh, right we need to dig under there

04:49:51.440 --> 04:49:54.720
Wait what now? Yeah, no, it does make sense. Yeah. Yeah, okay good

04:49:55.360 --> 04:49:57.680
I might have said it the wrong way by accident, but you know what I mean

04:49:59.440 --> 04:50:01.440
Uh

04:50:01.920 --> 04:50:03.920
Oh

04:50:04.880 --> 04:50:09.280
Right, is there a box 50 I'll take it 50

04:50:11.200 --> 04:50:13.200
We live in a society

04:50:13.920 --> 04:50:15.920
Honestly, I don't mind like I

04:50:16.480 --> 04:50:22.080
remember when the eyes were teased of the models and someone quote tweeted it and they were like

04:50:22.720 --> 04:50:25.040
Oh my god, they're actually coming out with a chocolate

04:50:26.000 --> 04:50:28.160
And like it really made me think like

04:50:29.760 --> 04:50:32.560
Holy shit, y'all motherfuckers don't get any love, do you? Um

04:50:34.160 --> 04:50:40.800
Because everyone's too busy being weird about it. Um, but it just wasn't even a it wasn't even a second thought like

04:50:41.200 --> 04:50:43.200
um, so as I said

04:50:44.080 --> 04:50:46.080
Azura was designed chocolate

04:50:47.040 --> 04:50:52.640
But we then when it came to model production, we made her racially ambiguous

04:50:53.600 --> 04:50:59.680
Because we didn't have a choice. Okay, we didn't have a choice. We had to make her racially ambiguous because we didn't know who was gonna get her but

04:51:02.720 --> 04:51:04.400
Um

04:51:04.400 --> 04:51:08.800
We could make maker chocolate. Um

04:51:10.880 --> 04:51:19.520
Am I being trolled? I'm being trolled. Um, sorry puzzle time. Hold on. Um, and basically like not to give anything away, but um

04:51:20.240 --> 04:51:23.840
You know, then you'd be surprised if another racially ambiguous pops up. Um

04:51:25.040 --> 04:51:26.800
Because just

04:51:26.800 --> 04:51:28.800
Not many designs really

04:51:29.120 --> 04:51:31.120
Wow, what's this?

04:51:31.680 --> 04:51:33.680
A dojo. Hello

04:51:35.120 --> 04:51:38.480
Swordsman ship is spirit. I am the finest or

04:51:39.040 --> 04:51:45.200
Maybe second finest swordman scar blade. Oh because he's got a scar. I like that. Thank you again for that tip

04:51:45.360 --> 04:51:52.320
Fucking 500 that's insane. Please do not tip anymore. That is an insane amount of money. Thank you though. I really appreciate it. Um

04:51:53.840 --> 04:51:55.840
But yes, um

04:51:56.000 --> 04:52:01.600
Basically ambiguous slash chocolate or eating well at veiler. I assure you headquarters are

04:52:02.160 --> 04:52:04.800
Looking after you. What am I doing spin blade?

04:52:05.360 --> 04:52:08.960
You speed up your great spin charge. You won't have to hold the button as long anymore

04:52:10.240 --> 04:52:12.240
Oh, what? That's so fast

04:52:13.200 --> 04:52:14.720
Is she edible?

04:52:14.720 --> 04:52:18.560
We need more chocolate. Well, I thought I thought you weren't so right

04:52:18.960 --> 04:52:23.040
This is just me being dumb like surprise surprise me being dumb named better joe. Um

04:52:24.000 --> 04:52:26.000
But I thought

04:52:26.000 --> 04:52:28.880
That you weren't supposed to say like chocolate and all that

04:52:29.600 --> 04:52:34.640
But then when azura came out and everyone was like chocolate chocolate. I'm like, oh wait, so

04:52:35.360 --> 04:52:37.360
chocolate's fine to say

04:52:37.920 --> 04:52:39.920
Because I didn't know

04:52:39.920 --> 04:52:41.920
But now I'm like, yeah chocolate

04:52:44.080 --> 04:52:46.080
Um

04:52:46.480 --> 04:52:50.480
But yes, right. We've already been there. That's fine. Um

04:52:53.760 --> 04:53:01.120
So, okay, we did unlock a few bits and bobbies here. Okay, we locked like a lot of bits and bobbies

04:53:02.560 --> 04:53:08.640
And some people find out I thought they did too, but then everyone was like, yeah chocolate and I was like, oh, right

04:53:08.640 --> 04:53:12.400
Okay, we're doing this right. Okay. Okay chocolate. Let's go chocolate. Yeah, chocolate feature first

04:53:12.880 --> 04:53:14.880
Let's go like I didn't know

04:53:15.440 --> 04:53:20.000
Um, but like, you know, I'm glad. Uh, yes, you please do not worry about

04:53:20.880 --> 04:53:23.040
a azura being the only

04:53:23.680 --> 04:53:29.440
Rashly ambiguous or chocolate. Um, you eat well at veal or I assure you that much

04:53:30.000 --> 04:53:31.680
um, and

04:53:31.680 --> 04:53:36.240
She be mere may not have something in the work smile smile. She may have something in it

04:53:37.200 --> 04:53:41.360
I just gonna be one of those things where I go po po po po po and it doesn't work

04:53:42.320 --> 04:53:43.440
and

04:53:43.440 --> 04:53:45.440
That's the weirdest shit I've ever heard

04:53:46.320 --> 04:53:48.320
Okay, let's go this way

04:53:48.400 --> 04:53:53.600
I think it has to do with fetishize and finkle a rich normally isn't what they want, but they're not veal or it's a fine

04:53:55.200 --> 04:53:58.000
Yeah, maybe I should ask Azura and she stares

04:53:59.440 --> 04:54:04.560
Um, okay. I've already gotten more for the heck was here. I completely forgot. However, I can swim

04:54:06.960 --> 04:54:08.960
I

04:54:10.640 --> 04:54:15.840
I'm back from being stepped on by she be did you get wrecked under her a mungus?

04:54:18.960 --> 04:54:25.120
Oh, I haven't been here. Okay. Okay. I'll take it red piece again. Okay. I'm taking a sipping tin of my tea

04:54:27.840 --> 04:54:31.680
I can't believe it. I can't believe people know realize that I am h word for

04:54:32.640 --> 04:54:34.640
a

04:54:35.200 --> 04:54:37.040
Cheeky bit of choco

04:54:37.040 --> 04:54:42.640
That's terrible. Please don't actually take anything. I say seriously. I am brain rot is from the core

04:54:44.160 --> 04:54:50.320
Um, there was a water thing over here. I'm like 99 percent sure

04:54:56.560 --> 04:55:00.720
Yes, there was I don't remember going in it if we have been here this

04:55:01.680 --> 04:55:03.680
I

04:55:03.920 --> 04:55:05.920
Have we been here?

04:55:11.360 --> 04:55:13.040
Oh

04:55:13.040 --> 04:55:16.800
Fucking hole in one don't mind me. I was uh one in five

04:55:17.920 --> 04:55:19.920
It's kind of like saying

04:55:20.160 --> 04:55:23.760
Need someone to be positive. Oh, she's almost died there because I was reading

04:55:24.400 --> 04:55:29.920
It's kind of like how saying something needs to be positive and not directly. We love the hmm

04:55:30.160 --> 04:55:32.160
I love that terminology

04:55:34.400 --> 04:55:36.400
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

04:55:36.640 --> 04:55:40.320
Uh, I do not want to lose health because that laser thing is

04:55:42.080 --> 04:55:45.280
Oh, that's cheating. That's right. That's how you get nuked into the strat sphere

04:55:48.640 --> 04:55:50.640
Oh wait, can I just deflect?

04:55:51.520 --> 04:55:54.960
Oh, I can just deflect. Are you joking me? These guys are so easy

04:55:55.920 --> 04:56:00.960
I can deflect of course I can deflect. Why wouldn't I be able to deflect?

04:56:01.680 --> 04:56:04.720
You totally neglect this area clearly don't at least you have

04:56:05.520 --> 04:56:10.880
At least you have been to ask this stuff and tell people I hope yeah, like I thought it was bad, but then like

04:56:12.240 --> 04:56:14.560
I am like chocolate was like celebrating

04:56:15.600 --> 04:56:17.600
Azura and I'm like wait, so

04:56:17.680 --> 04:56:19.680
It's a term fan

04:56:20.320 --> 04:56:22.320
Wait

04:56:25.200 --> 04:56:29.440
Now you all calm down in here you all calm down calm calm

04:56:30.640 --> 04:56:32.640
All right, give me the goods

04:56:34.160 --> 04:56:36.160
Sorry

04:56:36.320 --> 04:56:41.440
Yeah, whoever said that sneezes are like one-fifth of a honestly agreed. It feels really nice

04:56:42.960 --> 04:56:44.960
Oh, I got a new one. Did I get a new one?

04:56:46.400 --> 04:56:50.240
I think I've got a new one. Sorry. I'm too busy. Bless you. Thank you

04:56:51.200 --> 04:56:53.440
It gives on high. Thank you. Well

04:56:56.160 --> 04:56:58.160
Random German noises, okay

04:56:58.640 --> 04:57:01.040
Did I walk past this? I must go

04:57:02.000 --> 04:57:05.680
Okay, now I can't do anything else being weak. So we're gonna go back to being big

04:57:07.600 --> 04:57:09.600
Unless I can go over this

04:57:10.880 --> 04:57:14.000
Sure, what's over here? Let me know

04:57:16.160 --> 04:57:19.200
Uh can't go in there. Yeah, um

04:57:21.040 --> 04:57:23.440
Right, okay, we've done all we can being we

04:57:36.800 --> 04:57:41.280
How do I get big again? Jeez, this is quite a trick and I have to get big

04:57:44.000 --> 04:57:47.920
Oh boy, I better make plans for this after steam. It shouldn't be oh

04:57:48.880 --> 04:57:50.880
It'd be very refling that

04:57:51.520 --> 04:57:53.520
About to get showered in quality

04:57:53.680 --> 04:57:57.760
Um, I honestly thought it's gonna be a four hour stream. We've hit the five hour mark

04:57:57.760 --> 04:58:01.200
And we're like no the end is not in sight. I repeat the end is not in

04:58:03.440 --> 04:58:05.440
Oh, I'm actually gonna have to

04:58:06.240 --> 04:58:08.240
Do that fly thing

04:58:09.120 --> 04:58:11.120
No, I can just run across the

04:58:13.600 --> 04:58:17.360
Mate, I'm getting so turned around right now. I'm getting so turned around

04:58:18.800 --> 04:58:20.800
Where the heck am I?

04:58:21.920 --> 04:58:23.920
I need something to claim

04:58:26.400 --> 04:58:28.400
We might have a three parer I'm

04:58:32.000 --> 04:58:34.000
Moving

04:58:36.320 --> 04:58:40.240
That's so terrible that oh see that went a little better

04:58:44.880 --> 04:58:46.880
Wait, I've not done that one

04:58:48.720 --> 04:58:51.440
Oh, I think I need a poke it in its eye

04:59:02.240 --> 04:59:05.280
I wish they would perish permanently my only

04:59:06.160 --> 04:59:12.320
My only gripe with this game is just oh and I've gone away. I don't even need to go

04:59:13.040 --> 04:59:15.040
What happens if I jump down here? What happens? Hmm?

04:59:15.440 --> 04:59:17.440
They're far

04:59:17.920 --> 04:59:20.800
You will you teach me now master ugwe?

04:59:22.720 --> 04:59:27.280
Though my body may perish swiftly the first you were trained with me. So would you like to train? Yes

04:59:28.480 --> 04:59:34.320
This is the technique that I only have mastered only one who holds the sacred blade can perform the great spin attack first

04:59:34.320 --> 04:59:38.160
Do a spin attack press the button repeatedly. Yes, I understand

04:59:39.120 --> 04:59:41.920
Okay, let's go position

04:59:42.880 --> 04:59:48.640
It's a day ending in why so strong any forces are we flings for another 12 hour endurance stream no sleep blood

04:59:49.520 --> 04:59:54.880
I like the stories where they're like, oh I fell asleep at the start of your stream and then I got to wake up to you

04:59:55.120 --> 04:59:57.120
And I'm like, oh

04:59:57.280 --> 04:59:59.680
Okay, I like hurricane spin. That's so good

05:00:00.880 --> 05:00:03.280
My wings are like a hurricane

05:00:04.000 --> 05:00:08.880
That's a that's a hobbit with wings the smoke. No, there's nothing more. I can teach you you're on your own

05:00:10.640 --> 05:00:12.640
So if I'll learn everything

05:00:14.880 --> 05:00:20.240
Wait, wait a minute. Oh, no, I have to be small

05:00:21.680 --> 05:00:23.680
No, I have to go back

05:00:26.400 --> 05:00:30.080
I had I had to go in the sweet lily pad here to go here

05:00:30.400 --> 05:00:33.680
Say it so

05:00:34.880 --> 05:00:36.880
I will not oh butterfly

05:00:36.960 --> 05:00:42.720
You can cause you caught a joy butterfly. You can now shoot arrows faster than before. Oh, I like that

05:00:45.280 --> 05:00:49.760
There was something I was supposed to do back here and I didn't do it out of pure laziness. I'm sorry

05:00:54.560 --> 05:00:56.560
Oh, I need to finish my teeth. I almost forget

05:00:56.640 --> 05:01:05.040
You guys are just so interesting that you're like, I don't think I've ever had like a nice pipe and perfectly temperature tea

05:01:08.160 --> 05:01:11.280
I actually woke up from a nap earlier go waking up to use one of the pillagers

05:01:11.360 --> 05:01:16.800
I think yeah, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, it's actually really nice that no matter what time of day

05:01:17.280 --> 05:01:21.040
I get the opportunity to catch you live and I'm like, damn

05:01:21.680 --> 05:01:23.680
like that sounds like

05:01:24.000 --> 05:01:25.440
I'm like

05:01:25.440 --> 05:01:27.440
Addicted and like online all the time

05:01:27.680 --> 05:01:32.800
Also, me who is like, yeah, if you two didn't have vodishes, I'd probably pull you for like 14 hours

05:01:32.960 --> 05:01:34.960
Yeah, like stream for 14 hours. Yeah

05:01:36.160 --> 05:01:38.160
Maybe I do have a problem

05:01:38.720 --> 05:01:40.720
But it's a problem

05:01:40.880 --> 05:01:43.120
If it has if it's good, you know

05:01:43.360 --> 05:01:45.360
Yeah

05:01:49.040 --> 05:01:50.880
Yes, having a good day. Oh, I'm having a good day

05:01:50.880 --> 05:01:56.560
We're currently mucking about going back to see if we can pick up more hearts before we do this boss fight

05:01:56.960 --> 05:02:03.280
We are now missing 16 pieces, which is actually still quite a decent amount in all honesty

05:02:04.320 --> 05:02:06.000
um

05:02:06.000 --> 05:02:12.160
Unfortunately, I'm not aware where I missed. I need to trade quite a few Kinstone like there's a few waterfalls and stuff to the

05:02:12.800 --> 05:02:15.200
Right side of the map that I haven't unlocked. So

05:02:18.480 --> 05:02:24.160
You start when I finish working most of the time I just get to watch almost all of the streams that's good timing

05:02:25.760 --> 05:02:29.840
Shawnee's the best problem to have it's not a problem if we're all enjoying it

05:02:31.120 --> 05:02:34.560
If it's ever a problem and you need to you need to make your

05:02:35.760 --> 05:02:40.160
Your issues heard just go on my alt twitter and see if it's a problem after listening

05:02:43.040 --> 05:02:47.200
Oh, I just realized link blinks even though you're afk

05:02:51.840 --> 05:02:55.440
Okay, finish the tea. Let's see what I am missing

05:02:58.640 --> 05:03:00.640
We don't need to deal with that

05:03:01.600 --> 05:03:03.920
Is there anything hidden back there? Not that I can tell

05:03:05.120 --> 05:03:08.640
Okay, there's quite a few bits and bulbs here. Ow. Don't do that again

05:03:09.520 --> 05:03:11.520
Okay, there we go

05:03:13.040 --> 05:03:15.040
200 that's fantastic

05:03:17.120 --> 05:03:22.560
Oh get your pawn work. Oh, no, we don't have access. This is definitely a Kinstone

05:03:25.280 --> 05:03:27.600
Oh, and there's a beanstalk as well

05:03:29.280 --> 05:03:32.080
Oh, sorry, I didn't know I thought he was perished but he's not

05:03:35.680 --> 05:03:37.680
No, come on

05:03:39.600 --> 05:03:41.600
There we go

05:03:42.880 --> 05:03:47.840
Uh, wait, don't you be small over here? Oh, wow, I do need to be small from over here

05:03:48.400 --> 05:03:50.400
Okay, let's take a little meter

05:03:50.560 --> 05:03:54.160
You start streaming just around the time I'm able to get to my pc after work

05:03:54.480 --> 05:03:59.840
It's like seven company will I get to raw at my desk bro raw after work all you need to

05:04:00.240 --> 05:04:06.000
I used to be physically mentally drained after my wee shifts at the cafe

05:04:06.960 --> 05:04:11.440
Although working on the care homes actually probably rougher on the mental and

05:04:12.240 --> 05:04:15.840
But my favorite thing about being a waitress was like you'd be like

05:04:16.640 --> 05:04:22.960
I forgot the water for table seven when you're like going to bed and trying to sleep. You're like, oh, no

05:04:24.560 --> 05:04:29.360
Um, I always like laugh at those memories. You got a piece of heart make four

05:04:29.920 --> 05:04:31.920
Oh

05:04:32.400 --> 05:04:36.160
I still actually I still remember I served this couple

05:04:37.360 --> 05:04:38.800
um

05:04:38.800 --> 05:04:40.480
and there was a few

05:04:40.480 --> 05:04:45.360
Waitress and waitresses waitress I I don't know. There was a few of us on the floor

05:04:46.080 --> 05:04:50.960
But all of us unanimously assumed each other had gotten to that table

05:04:52.000 --> 05:04:54.880
And they were sitting waiting for 20 minutes on nothing and I was

05:04:55.200 --> 05:05:01.840
More like I felt so bad. I'm like felt so freaking bad. Honestly. Wait. I just under your turn. Um

05:05:03.040 --> 05:05:05.520
And I still think about that couple to this day

05:05:06.160 --> 05:05:08.000
I feel so sorry

05:05:08.000 --> 05:05:13.440
But basically they all made me go because I was the youngest and they were like, well, they're not going to be pissy

05:05:13.520 --> 05:05:19.840
Yeah, like a young waitress type thing. So I had to go but they were actually still like super nice. Um, and

05:05:20.160 --> 05:05:21.280
Um

05:05:21.280 --> 05:05:28.880
Because the owner worked with us like I explained the situation and we didn't charge them for drinks type thing

05:05:29.040 --> 05:05:35.520
Like I think it's called cop pain or something like when you don't get the person to

05:05:36.720 --> 05:05:38.720
um

05:05:39.200 --> 05:05:41.200
Right, we need to switch off this guy

05:05:43.120 --> 05:05:45.600
Because he'll run ahead which you really shouldn't do

05:05:46.320 --> 05:05:48.320
um

05:05:48.560 --> 05:05:54.480
I bet you made bank getting all the tips because you're so charming. Well, funny you mentioned that I had, um

05:05:56.480 --> 05:06:02.960
A co-worker who used to send me to get payments from folk because I was like a

05:06:03.680 --> 05:06:05.680
A peer very young and I look very young

05:06:06.240 --> 05:06:07.520
um

05:06:07.520 --> 05:06:12.240
And he was like, oh, they never tip me because I'm a guy but you're a chick

05:06:12.800 --> 05:06:16.720
So they'll tip you they'll tip you so you go out and get them to pay like say oh

05:06:16.720 --> 05:06:18.720
It's your turn to pay and all that

05:06:18.800 --> 05:06:20.800
and

05:06:20.960 --> 05:06:22.480
And I

05:06:22.480 --> 05:06:26.480
It actually did work. Like I think we tried it and it definitely worked

05:06:28.480 --> 05:06:30.480
And

05:06:30.480 --> 05:06:32.160
you know

05:06:32.160 --> 05:06:35.040
Strongly useful. Yes, I have a face of bobby

05:06:35.840 --> 05:06:37.200
Oh

05:06:37.200 --> 05:06:40.880
Because it's cutting the grass. Oh, there's a bill. All right. Okay. It's fine

05:06:42.320 --> 05:06:43.920
Harris

05:06:43.920 --> 05:06:45.920
I think there's an enemy in one of these

05:06:47.680 --> 05:06:50.160
Shawnee didn't hit no from the start

05:06:52.240 --> 05:06:54.240
Not quite

05:06:54.320 --> 05:06:59.680
Of course it works. They proved it in mythbusters. Wait, they didn't mythbusters that you get more tips if you're a chick

05:07:00.160 --> 05:07:02.880
I believe it. Oh bomba. How much bomba?

05:07:03.520 --> 05:07:05.520
What 100 bomba?

05:07:06.880 --> 05:07:08.880
That's actually pretty

05:07:09.440 --> 05:07:11.200
too much

05:07:11.200 --> 05:07:13.520
I just realized I haven't been checking the maps

05:07:14.480 --> 05:07:16.480
There's treasure in the left

05:07:17.600 --> 05:07:19.600
In the left

05:07:20.320 --> 05:07:26.160
There's treasure that I've not picked up. Okay. I'm actually kind of glad I've actually not gone back into the other temples

05:07:26.960 --> 05:07:32.480
Oh, there's treasure in here. What's the treasure? It's a freaking trap shadow wizard money gang

05:07:33.200 --> 05:07:35.200
We love kissing spells

05:07:37.760 --> 05:07:39.520
They got me

05:07:39.520 --> 05:07:41.520
Yay, we got you shells

05:07:42.160 --> 05:07:46.560
Okay. Well, that was actually kind of lucky because that I didn't wait. Is there like a thing here?

05:07:47.840 --> 05:07:49.840
Oh, there is

05:07:53.040 --> 05:07:55.040
Shawnee's passive, let me take your money

05:07:56.160 --> 05:07:58.160
If you're cute and nice

05:07:58.640 --> 05:08:03.120
Yeah, like I used to read the reviews and I always got mentioned in the reviews like ah, sorry

05:08:03.120 --> 05:08:05.760
I took so much pride in my movie waitress job

05:08:05.840 --> 05:08:07.840
Like I know some people might like well

05:08:08.160 --> 05:08:10.800
You guys wouldn't because you guys are reeflands and you guys get up

05:08:10.880 --> 05:08:16.880
But like some people then like oh it used to be a waitress like all you did was serve and like used to clean toilets at the end of the day

05:08:16.880 --> 05:08:21.440
And I'm like, yeah, I used to take pride in my work. I love my job. It was so fun and

05:08:22.240 --> 05:08:24.560
everything was like such a nice experience and

05:08:25.440 --> 05:08:29.360
Yeah, and I got to talk to people from all around the world because um

05:08:30.160 --> 05:08:32.560
it was like a tourism cafe and

05:08:33.120 --> 05:08:38.000
Like fuck yeah, I enjoyed my job like let's fuck up. Never anyone

05:08:39.440 --> 05:08:43.360
You know, some people are like embarrassed about their tail. I'm like no, I haven't made some time like it's a fuck size

05:08:43.360 --> 05:08:45.360
But like it's so fun

05:08:45.920 --> 05:08:49.040
No one should be ashamed of their job not then maybe like literally

05:08:50.560 --> 05:08:52.160
like

05:08:52.160 --> 05:08:56.160
I've never been thinking about it was like because I think if you ever like if

05:08:56.240 --> 05:09:00.560
If you talk to someone who's like never had a job before and they're like, oh you used to have to clean toilets

05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:03.120
Yeah, it's just part of the job like

05:09:03.280 --> 05:09:06.400
Someone's taking a fat job a although I will say one thing

05:09:06.400 --> 05:09:11.760
I had a really good boss if someone's fucking bombed the toilet. No, I didn't have to clean it

05:09:12.320 --> 05:09:18.000
Because my boss was so good like if it was like absolutely fucking nasty as fuck my boss would do it

05:09:21.840 --> 05:09:23.840
I don't trust this room

05:09:24.240 --> 05:09:26.240
Oh, well, there you go

05:09:26.640 --> 05:09:28.640
No, my boss was amazing

05:09:29.600 --> 05:09:31.600
It was literally a

05:09:33.120 --> 05:09:38.240
Change my life unironically. I know it sounds silly, but saying like oh that job changed my life

05:09:38.480 --> 05:09:41.680
But I like it actually unironically that they'll change like trajectory

05:09:43.440 --> 05:09:48.000
Um, because I was like very unconfident. I was like so unsure of myself. So

05:09:48.880 --> 05:09:51.440
How did I miss this? This is out in the open

05:09:52.720 --> 05:09:55.120
Right, let's go south see what happens

05:09:56.560 --> 05:09:57.600
Ow

05:09:57.600 --> 05:10:02.240
How did I bump off the edge of the map? Right, I'm pretty sure we're supposed to dig here

05:10:04.560 --> 05:10:07.920
Oh in the money

05:10:10.880 --> 05:10:17.120
Hello, we get to buy another couple of shells with that 800 coins for that

05:10:18.960 --> 05:10:23.840
But here uh fairies jump out of those things as well here

05:10:24.000 --> 05:10:28.160
Sorry, please don't shoot me. I'm just a little guy

05:10:30.960 --> 05:10:38.560
Because you ignored everything basically they got kinstones open. How dare you how dare you accuse me of my terrible gameplay

05:10:39.600 --> 05:10:42.160
Even though I've shown it here in 4k

05:10:43.680 --> 05:10:48.880
Literally dropping the album having a good boss makes everything so much easier. Oh, tell me about it

05:10:50.640 --> 05:10:52.640
Like at the care home

05:10:53.600 --> 05:10:58.000
Look, I'm just saying if you ever want to do the care home

05:11:00.880 --> 05:11:02.880
I'm pretty sure they committed like

05:11:03.040 --> 05:11:05.040
paycheck fraud with me

05:11:05.120 --> 05:11:08.800
and because when I like wrapped up my employment

05:11:09.600 --> 05:11:11.600
um, I got like extra

05:11:11.840 --> 05:11:17.520
500 great British pounds and I had to phone them up and be like you've overpaid me like you've paid me my

05:11:17.760 --> 05:11:23.680
Like my wages when I've not worked with you and they were like no no just take it and I'm like

05:11:25.600 --> 05:11:31.120
What do you mean just take it like a phone during everything no no just take it just

05:11:40.000 --> 05:11:46.800
So basically when I departed from the care home, I got like extra 500 quid from day nothing

05:11:48.320 --> 05:11:53.760
We are going to go spend all this money because this is it. Do you mind you're literally in my way in my way

05:11:54.800 --> 05:11:57.360
Okay, you can't actually run off into the next segment

05:11:58.480 --> 05:12:00.640
A little saucy. Oh, it was saucy. All right

05:12:01.200 --> 05:12:02.640
and

05:12:02.640 --> 05:12:06.640
I'm not going to complain an extra 500 quid in my pocket. They made me I was off on one

05:12:08.000 --> 05:12:10.000
and

05:12:10.000 --> 05:12:12.080
Put it in my wee bank account. Right. We're gonna buy

05:12:12.480 --> 05:12:17.680
Out what shells we can because we have far too much money and nothing to spend on

05:12:20.640 --> 05:12:25.040
Yeah, care homes are an absolute mess like they constantly change hands of management

05:12:25.040 --> 05:12:27.360
They constantly change companies and all of that

05:12:28.160 --> 05:12:32.880
They're constantly understaffed a stupid diss amount of understaffing

05:12:33.840 --> 05:12:38.160
Um, and they do it on purpose to maximize like earnings and all of that

05:12:38.720 --> 05:12:42.800
And it's like, you know who suffers the actual folk in the care home suffer because

05:12:43.280 --> 05:12:48.400
It's just chaos like from and the shifts are 12 hour. Oh, forgive me keep them this

05:12:48.880 --> 05:12:52.160
The shifts are 12 hours as well like sorry

05:12:52.720 --> 05:12:59.840
But the human body is tired after six hours and you're asking like four people to look after like

05:13:00.400 --> 05:13:06.320
How much elderly like 60 elderly on a ward type thing? Oh, it's absolutely crazy

05:13:07.280 --> 05:13:13.440
Oh, it's like that all over the world. So it's no it definitely is all over like it's pretty outrageous. How many

05:13:13.840 --> 05:13:15.840
Okay, we're gonna do five gamble

05:13:17.040 --> 05:13:20.880
We must be getting close to being done unless I'm like completely just

05:13:22.480 --> 05:13:24.480
blown smoke

05:13:27.360 --> 05:13:29.360
It

05:13:29.360 --> 05:13:31.360
Okay

05:13:31.680 --> 05:13:38.800
Yeah, let's get that probability up because that is uh, there's not even a point in doing the 1% probability

05:13:42.000 --> 05:13:47.360
Wait, is it gonna am I not gonna be able to achieve 100% if I put 99 in

05:13:50.240 --> 05:13:52.240
Big green to chew

05:13:52.880 --> 05:13:55.360
By all the monster adventure manuals

05:13:55.600 --> 05:14:00.880
Is that what the post office thing was when she was charging me 200 quid for and I was like not on your bike in

05:14:02.160 --> 05:14:06.080
Link between worlds lets you peg his his dash between screens if you play. Yeah

05:14:07.200 --> 05:14:09.200
maybe

05:14:09.280 --> 05:14:13.680
I need to look at that freaking new game that came out with the trailer

05:14:14.960 --> 05:14:20.800
As I said, I'd put it on but probably get copyright. I door mimic appears in the royal crypt

05:14:20.880 --> 05:14:26.480
They look like doors, but they're really traps if you get too close to make fall down. What a very unique thing

05:14:28.720 --> 05:14:30.720
Indeed

05:14:32.480 --> 05:14:38.080
Yeah, she is trying to sell you manuals which are the same price as the shells of 200 mimic hate

05:14:40.320 --> 05:14:42.320
Honestly 91

05:14:44.400 --> 05:14:47.360
Give me the goddamn getcha. Give me that thing right now

05:14:48.320 --> 05:14:50.320
I went in that shop

05:14:50.880 --> 05:14:54.880
Demi ma a pi ha appears on mount a cranel

05:14:55.680 --> 05:15:00.640
The strange beast hover on preparer like leaves you can pull them out of the sky with a gustar

05:15:02.880 --> 05:15:06.160
Does it get one more shell expensive retain?

05:15:07.360 --> 05:15:09.920
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about because

05:15:11.600 --> 05:15:16.560
It's literally nine percent probability one every nine getcha pulls. Yeah, I'm not doing that

05:15:17.040 --> 05:15:19.040
We'd be here for a millennial

05:15:21.280 --> 05:15:24.880
A hundred you're going to treat 92. Yes, I am

05:15:28.480 --> 05:15:34.480

93 yeah, this is gonna get rough

05:15:58.160 --> 05:16:00.320
I'm going to know what this man's doing all these shells

05:16:01.120 --> 05:16:05.600
Making acroband is although they actually be really cool and acrobat

05:16:06.400 --> 05:16:08.400
Oh, how would you put that in a model though?

05:16:09.200 --> 05:16:14.160
I always say I'm like, oh, that's such a good idea for a feature bar and then I'm like, how would you even execute that plan?

05:16:14.320 --> 05:16:20.160
It doesn't hurt and I forgot to get my blanket for my poor legs. I'm cutting this uh bucket

05:16:21.680 --> 05:16:26.240
78 8 of a new one one in four roughly

05:16:27.040 --> 05:16:29.040
It's sorry three in four roughly

05:16:31.280 --> 05:16:33.760
A rupee like appears in caverns dungeons

05:16:33.760 --> 05:16:40.160
This rupee like has a rupee dangling from its headstock the clever lure attracts greedy and delicious heroes

05:16:40.880 --> 05:16:42.640
They jump in me

05:16:42.640 --> 05:16:45.120
Right, let's see what is going on here

05:16:46.240 --> 05:16:48.240
One two three

05:16:49.920 --> 05:16:51.920
Four

05:16:55.120 --> 05:16:57.120
Four five

05:17:00.640 --> 05:17:02.640
Six

05:17:03.200 --> 05:17:05.200
Seven eight nine ten ten

05:17:07.680 --> 05:17:09.680
No way we're actually going to do it

05:17:10.640 --> 05:17:16.800
I thought it was impossible, but we're gonna do it. Uh, what do I need to adventure next?

05:17:19.600 --> 05:17:21.600
Top

05:17:22.640 --> 05:17:25.920
Did I go in the waterfall? I can't remember

05:17:29.520 --> 05:17:32.800
I think it's the I love monster goes major but many of the best

05:17:33.520 --> 05:17:39.200
Once has a bottom half a side in tragic. There's a lot of stuff where it was like in theory good

05:17:39.840 --> 05:17:41.040
actually

05:17:41.040 --> 05:17:43.040
You know executing it

05:17:45.120 --> 05:17:51.920
Uh, sorry, I'm a bit flabbergasted on where to go. Maybe bottom and try bottom

05:17:52.560 --> 05:17:56.720
Western world. Why not? I'm not really explored that. Have we have any question mark?

05:17:58.080 --> 05:18:00.800
I am I'm still missing like a lot though

05:18:01.120 --> 05:18:03.120
Oh

05:18:05.840 --> 05:18:08.160
Oh, no, I did I did

05:18:11.600 --> 05:18:15.920
Um, okay, maybe back over on this area again

05:18:36.880 --> 05:18:38.880
So this was what?

05:18:39.760 --> 05:18:45.840
Ah, okay. This is where I want to be. Yes. Okay. We're cutting the grass. Sorry. We're going on a grass cutting mission

05:18:47.040 --> 05:18:52.720
It's really important to high rule that we cut the grass. Okay. It's very important. I assure you

05:18:53.040 --> 05:18:55.440
It's not a waste of time whatsoever

05:18:56.400 --> 05:18:59.920
Okay, percy you you goober

Do you want to go back to your house? Oh, perfect. Okay

So do you not stay in here anymore? No, he's got right. He's gone back to his house. So hopefully he gives us something for that

05:19:34.960 --> 05:19:41.280
I'm cutting the grass cutty cutty grass. I'm cutting the grass. Well, I'll take the end

I don't know if this is actually faster, you know that I'm just getting hurt now, right?

05:20:07.440 --> 05:20:09.440
I should maybe pay attention a bit my bad

05:20:10.320 --> 05:20:12.480
I'm getting over zealots

05:20:13.280 --> 05:20:15.280
Is that a word?

05:20:15.760 --> 05:20:17.760
She asked nicely

05:20:18.160 --> 05:20:20.160
Is there anything here?

05:20:22.080 --> 05:20:24.080
No, I think there

05:20:26.080 --> 05:20:28.080
Wait, so I can go downwards

05:20:30.960 --> 05:20:36.080
Let's go and meet him in his house and maybe we can unlock something for doing it. Hi

05:20:36.800 --> 05:20:38.800
Oh, no, what's wrong?

05:20:39.040 --> 05:20:44.800
Oh dear Link won't you listen to my verse when I finally returned to my home sweet home a stranger was there

05:20:44.800 --> 05:20:48.080
I'm an extremely shy person. I just can't talk to someone. I don't know

05:20:48.400 --> 05:20:50.400
Sad to put my feelings on a verse

05:20:50.400 --> 05:20:55.440
Well, I was gone. Did you break in to practice your thieving art even if you robbed my home?

05:20:55.520 --> 05:20:57.520
You can never steal my heart

05:20:59.840 --> 05:21:07.280

05:21:26.720 --> 05:21:31.360
It's been totally rearranged, but I think it looks good. I put my feelings of gratitude to a verse

05:21:31.920 --> 05:21:33.120

05:21:33.120 --> 05:21:39.840
The way made safe I come back home to find me inside all alone in my chest my poor heart aches

05:21:39.840 --> 05:21:43.280
But for you I feel the deepest thing wait. Did that ring or did I say that wrong?

05:21:43.680 --> 05:21:49.200
My dresser is entirely stuffed with these icky blue shells. Would you clean them out for me?

05:21:50.080 --> 05:21:56.080
Yes, I'll clean them out. Yes, I will clean them out. Thank you so much. I appreciate it going with cute little heads

So you don't want to trade any kingstone. You're happy. Yeah, you happy bean. Okay, happy bean

05:22:03.040 --> 05:22:05.680
Okay, we're gonna go back to the minish realm

Because

05:22:11.120 --> 05:22:17.360
Um, I think we can now give over our magical green liquid. She'd let me give over the green liquid

05:22:28.320 --> 05:22:33.840
What a peaceful little game honestly I say that is if when we do the boss fight, I'm not going to be screaming

05:22:34.560 --> 05:22:38.240
Uh, just as a warning, uh, I'm not very strong at the boss fight. I

05:22:42.560 --> 05:22:46.400
Five minutes are over for sure for sure. She remembers. I know

05:22:58.320 --> 05:23:00.320
I don't remember having

05:23:01.120 --> 05:23:03.120
Oh

05:23:03.280 --> 05:23:05.280

Blood for the blood garden

I'm just gonna check I didn't leave any treasure in this place

05:23:47.440 --> 05:23:53.840
Because I might have left some twitters just in case I'll check the dungeon map

05:23:58.000 --> 05:24:03.120
No, I cleared it out completely. Okay, that's what I like to see. That's what I like to see a little cheeky heel here

05:26:41.520 --> 05:26:47.360
It is right. Let's check up on the guys. Let's see how they're doing because I'm pretty sure we unlocked a chest

05:26:48.560 --> 05:26:50.480
We did

05:26:50.480 --> 05:26:55.360
Don't mind us. How's it going? Do any of you want to trade? No you don't

05:26:55.920 --> 05:26:58.880
That's fine. Hopefully that's the last one down there

You can just jump over the bridge. Oh

05:29:45.440 --> 05:29:47.840
What's in here already picked up

05:29:50.240 --> 05:29:52.800
Then what this is the way to get to the

05:29:57.600 --> 05:29:59.600
The graveyard and that

05:30:02.080 --> 05:30:04.080
Yeah, we're on the graveyard

05:30:05.040 --> 05:30:11.040
Okay, I don't really need to come up this way, but hey home. We'll come back to the graveyard and I'm the mental

05:30:15.520 --> 05:30:17.520
Unless

05:30:24.800 --> 05:30:27.520
I saw that other chest there's no way

05:30:27.520 --> 05:30:29.520
Hey

05:30:29.680 --> 05:30:31.680
Oh my god

Yes, 100 shells as well

05:30:35.600 --> 05:30:38.160
No way that's such a um

05:30:39.840 --> 05:30:41.840
Such a hidden place

05:30:42.560 --> 05:30:45.920
You can't go any further that way. We're just fine, baby. You

05:30:46.960 --> 05:30:48.960
So then what's in here

05:30:49.760 --> 05:30:51.760
That's just where we were. Okay

05:30:52.640 --> 05:30:54.640
More shells gamer time

05:30:54.640 --> 05:30:56.640
Was it this bomb left one?

05:30:57.760 --> 05:31:00.640
And then we can see what it what this is all about

05:31:01.680 --> 05:31:03.680
Red piece. Perfect. That's what I like to see

05:31:06.240 --> 05:31:09.520
Okay, okay, what is in this chest?

05:31:12.160 --> 05:31:14.800
Because it's big whatever it is. It's not like a regular chest

05:31:17.280 --> 05:31:19.280
It is uh

05:31:20.960 --> 05:31:25.680
You've got a magical hold the button when you throw it and use to control its path. Oh

05:31:26.000 --> 05:31:28.000
So I can dictate now. Okay

05:31:30.400 --> 05:31:36.560
Uh, I need to go buy shells now because I'm starting to get a lot of money on my persons again

05:31:38.640 --> 05:31:44.640
We're gonna do we're actually gonna get all the gacha from and where do I need the shop the main shop

05:31:50.240 --> 05:31:52.240
Oh, I went past it

05:31:52.800 --> 05:31:54.800
Do

05:31:55.120 --> 05:31:58.960
Buy the manual first. Okay. Yes. I will go buy the manual

05:32:00.480 --> 05:32:04.400
It said you said it was 200 for the manual, right? I'll buy two

05:32:06.000 --> 05:32:08.000
I'll buy two

05:32:08.320 --> 05:32:10.320
Shells and then I'll have enough for the manual

05:32:12.320 --> 05:32:15.920
How many you got in you? Oh, sorry. I like perfectly cover up. I've got

05:32:17.040 --> 05:32:19.840
345 so we're gonna go get the manual which is 200

05:32:20.800 --> 05:32:22.800

05:32:23.600 --> 05:32:25.600

I don't even know what this does. Hello, I'm selling uh swordsman's letter right now. You can buy it. Yeah, absolutely

05:32:36.560 --> 05:32:43.280
Thanks for supporting remember to come out as swift as the blade right. What did that do? Is it something new? Okay, there is something new. Hello

05:32:44.400 --> 05:32:46.400
Would you like to read it? Sure

05:32:47.360 --> 05:32:52.160
Go wall so somewhat it may look like a regular wall, but you may find something you can bought

05:32:52.160 --> 05:32:56.560
There's actually easy way to tell and I'm here to teach you build up the power and start sticking things in a wall

05:32:56.560 --> 05:32:59.760
If you pay attention, you'll find a spot that makes a different sound continue

05:33:01.440 --> 05:33:06.000
Don't give up start mashing buttons. You might be able to escape quickly continue reading

05:33:06.240 --> 05:33:11.920
Sliftly gossip the magical boomerang somewhere in Hyrule. You can find a credibly. I just got it

05:33:12.640 --> 05:33:15.920
Uh, so this is like just telling me

05:33:18.320 --> 05:33:22.640
Oh, no, see you in issue two. I don't have enough for issue two

05:33:24.080 --> 05:33:29.440
Manual that's plural. Well, I've just lost all my money. We need to get you first. Okay

05:33:30.960 --> 05:33:35.040
100% of gamblers give up before they win or something. I don't know

05:33:38.000 --> 05:33:40.400
How many shells all of them

05:33:42.080 --> 05:33:46.320
Because then we don't need to put our money towards the shells anymore when we're traveling about

05:33:48.400 --> 05:33:53.040
You're gonna trade 95. Yeah, I guess 95 shoes

05:33:54.480 --> 05:33:56.480
Unlike the shells there aren't infinite manuals

05:33:58.880 --> 05:34:04.320
Spear moblin appears in minish woods. They rush you on site. Yeah, they're great. I don't like them

05:34:05.280 --> 05:34:08.320
How many have I got I've got one more roll. Oh, no

05:34:09.280 --> 05:34:11.280
Yes, one more trade, please

05:34:12.560 --> 05:34:14.560
One more

05:34:17.120 --> 05:34:20.080
After getting every figure you can trade them for money, I believe

05:34:24.080 --> 05:34:29.120
Actually that may be infinite money glitch because you get five coins for a repeated figure

05:34:30.240 --> 05:34:32.240
And one shell to five

05:34:33.120 --> 05:34:35.840
A trap appears a very a trap with sharp blades. Yeah

05:34:36.560 --> 05:34:44.080
Right, we what was that? We need eight more things. We just need 800

05:34:46.000 --> 05:34:50.640
The house has it after getting every figure you can trade them the house has a money on heart. Yes

05:34:50.640 --> 05:34:53.600
There's definitely a heart in that like casino type thing

05:34:55.040 --> 05:34:57.040
Um

05:34:58.160 --> 05:35:04.160
I've lined up a sizable pile of cash for my maybe I should start breeding pets next. No, that's the mean

05:35:06.000 --> 05:35:09.440
I think the time has come. I've moved beyond words

05:35:14.080 --> 05:35:18.800
Um, that's for gamba wait, I keep going in here, but I've already done it

05:35:20.560 --> 05:35:22.560
Breeding the leaflings

05:35:24.960 --> 05:35:26.960
I think I've done

05:35:28.720 --> 05:35:30.720
What I can

05:35:31.040 --> 05:35:33.600
In this area was there someone in school

05:35:33.840 --> 05:35:40.240
Oh, the teachers are gone. Oh, they've changed. I have to see the kids off home myself

05:35:40.400 --> 05:35:44.960
Yes, you need to look after the wanes, believe it or not. Oh, the children aren't eating anymore

05:35:47.360 --> 05:35:50.320
Oh, no one's even playing outside. That's so sad

05:35:52.080 --> 05:35:55.040
Gimli I can hear it going up

05:35:57.120 --> 05:36:00.720
Uh, I can't remember. Is this the but okay, that's the bomb side. We don't need to do that

05:36:04.560 --> 05:36:06.560
Mm-hmm

05:36:08.720 --> 05:36:13.040
And a new mpc gonna spawn oh look at the meatball

05:36:18.000 --> 05:36:22.160
Uh, right, where have we not we did go down in the swamp

05:36:23.040 --> 05:36:24.320
Western

05:36:24.320 --> 05:36:27.520
Highlands we've not mocked about in the graveyard

05:36:28.000 --> 05:36:32.720
Let's go with the graveyard. I know this seems really weird. We've no mocked about in the graveyard

05:36:33.840 --> 05:36:35.840
Can it show them

05:36:35.920 --> 05:36:38.720
It's graveyard. Oh, I think it's off a bit more

05:36:47.680 --> 05:36:49.680
Wait, is it? No it is

05:36:51.680 --> 05:36:53.680
But I can't go that way

05:36:56.960 --> 05:36:59.840
Hardly mean for being so rude it wasn't

05:37:04.560 --> 05:37:06.560
Hmm

05:37:06.960 --> 05:37:11.920
Let's see if there's anything to do in the graveyard that we technically haven't done

05:37:14.560 --> 05:37:16.560
Okay

05:37:18.160 --> 05:37:22.720
Oh, there's so many sections of the map

05:37:25.200 --> 05:37:29.520
The lily pad I forgot to do the lily pad in the swamp. We're gonna go back and do that

05:37:29.920 --> 05:37:35.760
I like if you've interacted with it. It's no longer on the map. I actually really appreciate that. Thank you game devs

05:37:38.560 --> 05:37:40.560
Um

05:37:40.800 --> 05:37:43.680
Post office still needs something to do the placement

05:37:45.600 --> 05:37:51.760
There's a waterfall. Okay. Actually, this is like really handy dandy when interested math. It's just

05:37:53.360 --> 05:37:55.360
Building

05:37:55.920 --> 05:38:07.120
We're to go to the mystic hut. There's a treasure chest and there's a monster. Okay. This is like so I didn't really even did this for you

05:38:08.720 --> 05:38:13.760
That's fantastic. Honestly, right? Let's deal with the graveyard first

05:38:15.200 --> 05:38:17.200
Let me let me give a light on

05:38:18.080 --> 05:38:23.840
Literally such a like quality of item type a quality of life type thing for games to put in

05:38:25.600 --> 05:38:27.760
They didn't have to go this hard and yet here we are

05:38:29.280 --> 05:38:38.880
Shawnee is close to 8k. I'm going to try and schedule the clapping video. I've already got the artwork. Wait, what's down here?

Oh, he's gonna move and we can interact with something in the town

05:44:32.640 --> 05:44:36.720
I don't know why I've been such a nasty little prankster all of a sudden. I feel like a week's been lifted

05:44:36.720 --> 05:44:41.360
I feel like I've made up for all my dreadful deeds. Hey spooktor. See you in paradise

05:44:41.920 --> 05:44:50.160

But it made the unlock noise

05:45:17.280 --> 05:45:19.280

I could swim faster man. You can read fast if you read that even I didn't read and I'm the one playing the game

05:45:32.960 --> 05:45:34.960
I can't even read that fast

05:45:38.160 --> 05:45:40.640
Dig on it. I did try and dig on it before

05:45:41.360 --> 05:45:44.880
Right, hold on. I'm gonna come back to her in case she wants to trade multiple times

05:45:48.320 --> 05:45:52.480
Ah, no, you came back. I'm so happy in this group, but please make yourself feel at home

05:45:53.760 --> 05:45:56.480
Mmm. I mean technically it'll be home once um

05:45:57.920 --> 05:45:59.040
So

05:45:59.040 --> 05:46:03.120
Is she actually that wrong? Do you want to trade again? No, you've traded out

05:46:04.800 --> 05:46:06.800
Um

05:46:08.000 --> 05:46:12.000
Hold on. I'll put the v ocarina on a ocarina. Wow

05:46:15.200 --> 05:46:20.640
It's that was a graveyard area, right? We'll go to town and see what's going on with that chicken farm

05:46:22.640 --> 05:46:24.640
Oh dig the dirt in the group

05:46:25.760 --> 05:46:32.400
I did try it. I did try it before I don't know why it wouldn't let me do it the first time if that is actually the solution

05:46:33.120 --> 05:46:38.000
Um, right. I need to be we and I need to go inside the chicken house

05:46:38.560 --> 05:46:41.280
So I will go in here. Do you want to trade? No, you don't

05:46:43.040 --> 05:46:47.600
You should visit the minish. It's probably been five minutes. I agree. It probably has

05:46:49.520 --> 05:46:51.520
Right, what's going on in this chicken house?

05:46:55.200 --> 05:46:58.960
Oh, shit fucking get me out of here

05:46:59.920 --> 05:47:07.120
What the kinstone piece fused and disappeared now? I can't get it now. I can't get it back to anju. I'm still happy

05:47:09.920 --> 05:47:12.240

No, do not go into the cuckoo house seriously

05:47:23.920 --> 05:47:29.040
Fewer people means less trash. I'm having a tough time fading. Oh, no, he's a swing kind of swing

05:47:32.480 --> 05:47:34.800
Okay, get me to normal size again

05:47:37.760 --> 05:47:39.760
Go back three left and three up

05:47:45.840 --> 05:47:47.840
Three left and three up

05:47:48.400 --> 05:47:56.800
And you is the chicken lady, is she gonna trade me a kinstone? Oh, no

05:48:05.360 --> 05:48:08.880
Oh wait, I have these shoes now. I can go to the chickens really fast

05:48:11.280 --> 05:48:13.280
I know I don't what can cycle pass that

05:48:14.240 --> 05:48:19.040
Oh, well, right. I'm not going for the gold chickens, I guess because they don't actually stay

05:48:22.720 --> 05:48:27.440
No, I can't run with the chicken in my hand. No, I'm gonna mess up. Okay. I messed up

05:48:27.440 --> 05:48:31.200
I won't go for the golden ones because the golden ones don't stay in your hand

05:48:32.160 --> 05:48:38.080
Hmm. Well, it's like I'm still missing a lot of cuckoos, but thank well, maybe if you didn't have some golden bam ones

05:48:40.800 --> 05:48:42.800
Oh, I hurt him

05:48:44.240 --> 05:48:49.360
Sorry, look a bit of animal violence never really hurt anyone. Just hurt the animal

05:48:52.000 --> 05:48:56.640
Maybe if it didn't run halfway across the map, I could actually have a chance to get the dying thing

05:48:58.480 --> 05:49:03.360
Oh, no pick it up. All right. There are four. Is that how much you needed?

05:49:04.320 --> 05:49:06.320

Yes, what are the spawn locations?

05:53:13.840 --> 05:53:19.680
Okay, it's very unlikely the first time we do this we get it because of the spawn locations changing

05:53:21.920 --> 05:53:26.160
Uh, wow, they are not close by holy moly

05:53:27.360 --> 05:53:29.360
That's the spawn locations

05:53:30.160 --> 05:53:32.160
Halfway across the map

05:53:32.160 --> 05:53:33.600
The third and fourth

05:53:33.600 --> 05:53:37.760

05:53:37.760 --> 05:53:42.080
That'd honestly be classic. I could only have four she wants six

05:53:43.120 --> 05:53:44.640
Oh

05:53:44.640 --> 05:53:46.640

05:53:51.440 --> 05:53:53.440
Only

05:53:54.000 --> 05:53:57.520
How am I supposed to get six to her? I can't pick up

05:53:58.640 --> 05:54:03.200
I'm out of time unless I can throw it. Can I eat it? Can I punch it? Can I punch it? Oh

05:54:06.560 --> 05:54:11.120
What was that? Hmm not enough. Why are they so far away?

05:54:12.960 --> 05:54:14.960
Need no clips. She said five

05:54:16.560 --> 05:54:20.000
And wait, I could have done it if I didn't mess up the pickup right hold on

05:54:20.000 --> 05:54:24.240
I can't remember where the other ones where I've already freaking forgotten right. There was one on the staircase

05:54:24.320 --> 05:54:29.680
You're coming with me right. There's one also there by the staircase. It's just fine. We can come back for him

05:54:30.800 --> 05:54:32.800
Pegasus boots

05:54:33.360 --> 05:54:35.360
Okay, two

05:54:35.360 --> 05:54:38.640
Okay, okay, and then there was one by the bridge and one by the dojo

05:54:39.520 --> 05:54:40.560
Oh

05:54:40.560 --> 05:54:44.000
Okay, no, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that. You don't want to do that

05:54:44.000 --> 05:54:51.120
It's fine. It's fine. Just allow the knife to impale your no your little chicken meaty body. Stop. Stop

05:54:51.600 --> 05:54:53.920
Stop. Oh, right. We're gonna have to redo this one

05:54:55.760 --> 05:55:01.040
But we know stop stop just accept the the impolition

05:55:01.840 --> 05:55:03.840
Right at least we know

05:55:04.560 --> 05:55:11.760
Three to the left to north. We know we know. Oh, I can use the bridge as well. I forgot about that

05:55:12.560 --> 05:55:13.600
Right

05:55:13.600 --> 05:55:17.440
Give me a chance. Give me a chance kids game by the way. Give me a chance

05:55:18.400 --> 05:55:20.400
Right two up north. Let's go

05:55:21.840 --> 05:55:26.240
Easy easy easy get this freaking beast that are checking first

05:55:27.280 --> 05:55:31.040
Easy easy into the pen into the pen

05:55:31.280 --> 05:55:35.200
Easy to pick it up

05:55:36.880 --> 05:55:42.240
Lunk, you know exactly what I was getting you to pick up there. Oh my god. I'm spending 20 seconds getting those two

05:55:46.880 --> 05:55:51.840
Stop it stop it. Oh, I keep I give up

05:55:52.880 --> 05:55:58.640
There's no point. I give up. I give up. I'm going in the house. Fuck you. I'm resetting. I'm resetting. I need a reset

05:55:59.600 --> 05:56:02.000
Maybe I should go for the ones to the left first

05:56:05.200 --> 05:56:08.160
Give me a chicken body. Yeah, we bam you

05:56:10.160 --> 05:56:12.160
Oh

05:56:12.400 --> 05:56:15.600
Literally how long to get this first one in the post

05:56:20.640 --> 05:56:22.640
It's fine

05:56:29.520 --> 05:56:31.520
It's

05:56:36.080 --> 05:56:38.080
It's fine that he keeps getting caught in the same

05:56:58.640 --> 05:57:00.640
Oh

05:57:14.400 --> 05:57:21.600
Don't ever lose those chickens again. Do you understand me young lady? Don't you

05:57:22.800 --> 05:57:25.120
Ever lose those chickens again

05:57:25.120 --> 05:57:29.920
Here's your reward. I appreciate the shells

05:57:32.240 --> 05:57:34.240
She's not done

05:57:39.120 --> 05:57:41.120
She's not done

05:57:44.000 --> 05:57:46.000
Now do six in a minute

05:57:48.400 --> 05:57:51.440
Oh, please tell me she gives a heart piece

05:57:55.280 --> 05:58:05.360
All right, one's right at the door. That's fine. One's by the water. That's fine

05:58:09.200 --> 05:58:12.240
One's by the shop the general store

05:58:13.680 --> 05:58:15.680
Up the waterfall maybe

05:58:16.800 --> 05:58:18.800
No

05:58:19.760 --> 05:58:25.920
Well, you're probably going to be a lot faster. Okay, we know there's no two up north which is fine

05:58:26.720 --> 05:58:31.040
And there's not one by the dog. We're just doing information gathering on this one. Okay

05:58:31.760 --> 05:58:33.760
It's not a big deal

05:58:33.760 --> 05:58:34.880
Okay

05:58:34.880 --> 05:58:37.680
Yeah, I do not have enough time to reach

05:58:39.520 --> 05:58:42.000
Unless pause

05:58:45.280 --> 05:58:47.280
Oh, we did it

05:58:47.920 --> 05:58:49.920
Oh

05:58:56.400 --> 05:58:58.400
It's it's not over

05:59:00.320 --> 05:59:04.640
It's not over it's not hashtag over

05:59:08.320 --> 05:59:13.840
Uh, we'll buy the next manual because she's actually given us enough money to buy all the manual so

05:59:14.800 --> 05:59:16.800
I'll buy the next one

05:59:18.640 --> 05:59:24.320
Just unequipped your sword. I never even thought of that. Holy crap. Where have you been all my life?

05:59:26.400 --> 05:59:29.440
No, we all had to do is unequip the sword

05:59:30.880 --> 05:59:35.680
So the chickens would stop running halfway across the map when I touched them with my pointy sword

05:59:36.800 --> 05:59:40.480
Yeah, take that right. Well, I definitely don't want to accidentally activate that item

05:59:43.920 --> 05:59:45.920
Decape a terrible idea

05:59:47.760 --> 05:59:51.840
All of these seem like terrible ideas have it. What do you want?

05:59:53.760 --> 05:59:57.840
She gives me an extra five seconds to catch a whole other chicken

05:59:58.880 --> 06:00:01.600
Oh, you're taking the absolute mincemeat honestly

06:00:03.680 --> 06:00:08.960
Oh, all right. Okay. I'm not right. Okay. This is just information gathering clearly

06:00:09.920 --> 06:00:14.640
One by the stairs. Is there one by the dog? There is one by the dog. Okay

06:00:17.120 --> 06:00:21.280
Okay, let's try the waterfall. I call it the waterfall, but it's not one here

06:00:21.600 --> 06:00:27.520
I am not picking up a golden chicken. I actually refuse. I'd call me chickenist. I don't care

06:00:28.160 --> 06:00:33.280
I am not picking up a golden chicken. They are liars. They are cheats and they smell bad

06:00:36.000 --> 06:00:38.000
Okay

06:00:38.480 --> 06:00:43.920
Is that six? One, two, three, four, five, six. Oh my god, we did it. It's so much easier if you just don't touch them

06:00:46.640 --> 06:00:48.640
That's up

06:00:49.360 --> 06:00:51.360
Please be done

06:00:51.920 --> 06:00:53.920
That's it. You got

06:00:54.160 --> 06:00:56.160
Oh, please woman

06:00:56.480 --> 06:00:58.480
Oh, please woman

06:01:00.400 --> 06:01:02.400
70

06:01:02.640 --> 06:01:04.640
Can I even pick? Oh

06:01:04.720 --> 06:01:13.760
Just restart just I'm not even entertaining it. I'm not even entertaining it. Yes, I will I will help

06:01:15.200 --> 06:01:17.200
One

06:01:19.760 --> 06:01:21.760
Two

06:01:22.640 --> 06:01:25.600
Is there one by the dog? Not there I can see

06:01:27.440 --> 06:01:31.600
Oh, there is but it's golden. Don't trust it. Don't trust the golden chicken

06:01:35.440 --> 06:01:38.480
Oh, maybe trust it a little bit because we can just start right in

06:01:40.560 --> 06:01:42.560
Fuck you

06:01:45.600 --> 06:01:48.240
I don't know what number oh postman give the

06:01:49.200 --> 06:01:51.200
fucking road

06:01:51.200 --> 06:01:53.200
Get out of the fucking road

06:01:53.360 --> 06:02:00.240
Right, what happens if I do this? Do you just accept it? Oh my god. Go go go towards the pen into the pen

06:02:00.880 --> 06:02:02.880
Did I do it? Did that count?

06:02:03.680 --> 06:02:05.680
Oh my god, did that count? I don't know

06:02:06.400 --> 06:02:08.080
Go into the pen

06:02:08.080 --> 06:02:10.480
No, don't go back you silly sausage

06:02:11.360 --> 06:02:15.920
Go into the pen into the pen and no, did I get it? I don't know if I got did that count

06:02:18.640 --> 06:02:20.640
No way that worked

06:02:21.840 --> 06:02:25.040
190 rupees. Well, I guess we'll go buy the

06:02:26.400 --> 06:02:31.280
The next manual because she's actually giving me so many rupees we can buy all the manuals

06:02:33.840 --> 06:02:42.240
Not to be confused with Emmanuel the one viewer from Mexico watching us right now speak welcome. I'm selling. Yes, you are. Yes, please

06:02:42.400 --> 06:02:44.400
I'd like to buy

06:02:44.880 --> 06:02:48.000
I'm literally smurfed that golden one honestly. I don't know how I did that

06:02:56.960 --> 06:03:02.000
Wait, how many I can do another getcha. I think there's at least eight left

06:03:03.040 --> 06:03:05.040
women

06:03:11.200 --> 06:03:13.680
I don't trust it

06:03:15.680 --> 06:03:17.680
I don't trust it

06:03:19.120 --> 06:03:24.480
I don't trust it. They like on the other side of the okay. They're like literally on the other side of the map

06:03:27.520 --> 06:03:29.520
Right one is behind the

06:03:30.480 --> 06:03:34.720
Shoe shop as for the other one

06:03:36.960 --> 06:03:40.560
There's where exactly by the skull no

06:03:42.880 --> 06:03:44.880
I don't know

06:03:47.280 --> 06:03:50.640
By the exit, I don't know if I'm gonna make it over there in time

06:03:52.720 --> 06:03:53.920
Maybe

06:03:53.920 --> 06:03:55.920
If no one gets in my way

06:03:56.800 --> 06:04:00.000
I said if no one gets in my way then maybe I can make it

06:04:02.240 --> 06:04:04.800
We may have done it we may have done it

06:04:06.000 --> 06:04:09.840
Wow, we actually did it. Please be the last one and I'm so tired

06:04:10.800 --> 06:04:12.800
Time's up. Time's up. Yes. Yes

06:04:14.160 --> 06:04:16.400
Thanks. Here's your reward king stone piece

06:04:19.280 --> 06:04:21.280
Darling

06:04:21.600 --> 06:04:23.600
What do you want now three

06:04:24.320 --> 06:04:27.920
And they're on the other side of the map, of course, because why wouldn't they be?

06:04:30.320 --> 06:04:32.320
No

06:04:32.320 --> 06:04:38.320
No, I don't know right. This is just information gathering. I'm not even

06:04:44.800 --> 06:04:48.880
Is there any on this side of the map? I don't think so because the dog would block you

06:04:49.840 --> 06:04:53.840
Right, are you John? Get another

06:04:55.200 --> 06:04:57.200
That's what I think about you as well

06:04:59.600 --> 06:05:03.760
All right, let's just check out the town center nothing

06:05:06.080 --> 06:05:10.480
A golden one is I have to contend with two golden chickens

06:05:11.600 --> 06:05:13.600
Oh, I don't know if I can do that

06:05:14.240 --> 06:05:16.960
Sorry, we're gonna have to do a bit more information gather

06:05:17.120 --> 06:05:21.040
That's the three two golden and one weight from halfway across the map

06:05:22.000 --> 06:05:24.000
Oh, I don't know about that darling

06:05:27.600 --> 06:05:29.600
I don't know if I can do this

06:05:30.160 --> 06:05:36.400
It's the last mission is it actually you're not trolling me. She shouldn't be able to have chickens. I haven't much I drown

06:05:36.400 --> 06:05:38.400
I'm honestly

06:05:40.160 --> 06:05:42.160
Uh, right, we'll do a run

06:05:43.600 --> 06:05:50.960
We're gonna swim across the water to get that blue one the white one. Sorry and literally run like nothing on earth

06:05:53.040 --> 06:05:54.640
Wait unless

06:05:54.640 --> 06:05:59.760
Can I throw it without getting in the water? I can okay curious curious

06:06:00.240 --> 06:06:04.160
That's probably our solution. Unfortunately. It does get a bit freaked out

06:06:05.280 --> 06:06:07.680
But if that is our solution

06:06:07.920 --> 06:06:09.120
I

06:06:09.120 --> 06:06:14.160
Was going to say to because to go all the way around seems pretty impossible from being honest

06:06:14.240 --> 06:06:19.440
And then the golden one should be here go down here and then pick you up and go down there and pick you up

06:06:19.440 --> 06:06:23.120
Then go down there and freaking pick you up and then go there

06:06:23.680 --> 06:06:27.760
No pick you up and then go there right. I've not got it

06:06:27.920 --> 06:06:32.480
But I think I have the mechanics that I'm supposed to participate in down

06:06:33.120 --> 06:06:34.960
which is fine

06:06:34.960 --> 06:06:38.000
I kind of just need to like pick it up so it doesn't change its mind

06:06:43.120 --> 06:06:48.480
We are never having the velar farm at this rate. No not by the way. I'm fucking handling these champions honestly

06:06:50.240 --> 06:06:52.240
Right get the white one first

06:06:56.240 --> 06:07:02.000
No, don't get stuck on something long. We're literally in a time crunch right don't

06:07:02.960 --> 06:07:08.960
Okay, much better much better strats are coming in strats are coming in I repeat strats are coming

06:07:09.680 --> 06:07:11.680
Call me strats because I'm coming

06:07:12.800 --> 06:07:17.600
Right, there's one up here pick them up throw them down the alleyway pick them up

06:07:32.240 --> 06:07:38.400
Not now not now buddy not now. Oh

06:07:40.080 --> 06:07:42.480
No, I did it. No way

06:07:43.360 --> 06:07:47.600
That better be the last one reflin or I'm gonna take you out for telling me fibbers

06:07:49.200 --> 06:07:53.360
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you

06:07:55.440 --> 06:07:57.440
Oh, it's over

06:07:58.000 --> 06:08:04.000
No, you're on your own you've given me what I need couldn't get less of a shite

06:08:04.560 --> 06:08:08.240
Couldn't get less of a shite if your flock goes out hen

06:08:09.120 --> 06:08:11.120
That is your problem

06:08:11.760 --> 06:08:15.600
You are so incompetent and I couldn't gear at us

06:08:18.800 --> 06:08:23.120
Now it's repeatable for crap cash, okay. Yes, I would like a guide

06:08:23.680 --> 06:08:25.680
Please

06:08:28.640 --> 06:08:31.440
Uh, right we are going to go small

06:08:33.280 --> 06:08:37.520
So we can talk to the minish that's currently inside this house

06:08:38.480 --> 06:08:40.480
Oh

06:08:48.720 --> 06:08:53.200
Chimney a bit of a chimney moment. Oh, pardon me

06:08:58.480 --> 06:09:00.480
I need to break the pots

06:09:03.120 --> 06:09:05.440
Oh, I need to break the pots

06:09:06.320 --> 06:09:08.320
I

06:09:08.880 --> 06:09:13.520
Need to of course I need to uh, sorry. Sorry. Don't how could I be so silly?

06:09:13.680 --> 06:09:20.000
Of course, I would need to break the pots in her house first in order to enable me to do what I need

06:09:20.320 --> 06:09:22.320
Of course, don't be silly

06:09:23.600 --> 06:09:29.360
How preposterous of me to break a pot. I'll break your fucking pot honestly

06:09:31.280 --> 06:09:33.280
Right, let's try that

06:09:35.440 --> 06:09:37.440
Break a pot

06:09:37.680 --> 06:09:39.680
Why wouldn't I break a pot?

06:09:40.560 --> 06:09:44.480
Break a fucking pot. Fucking stupid bitch having fucking pots. Hi

06:09:45.440 --> 06:09:50.800
Want a charm? No, I don't actually I'm so annoyed at you for those pots and those pots better stay destroyed

06:09:50.880 --> 06:09:54.880
Exactly. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. You are not replacing those pots

06:09:55.040 --> 06:10:00.080
I will destroy them every single time you'll waste all your earnings and you will never quash

06:10:00.800 --> 06:10:04.800
Of course, it's okay. It's okay. Of course I would need to break the pot. Why would I need to break the pot? Of course I would need to break the pot

06:10:05.680 --> 06:10:07.680
I'm losing it

06:10:09.280 --> 06:10:20.160
Okay, I don't know if we can a hundred percent it because unfortunately I am running very low on ideas of what I need to do next

06:10:22.960 --> 06:10:26.320
I like how she doesn't notice any of this going on behind just a

06:10:28.720 --> 06:10:32.800
Like really obnoxious like furniture moving noises and she's like, okay

06:10:33.440 --> 06:10:36.400
Welcome, this is my new house. Uh, don't you just love the new house smell?

06:10:36.480 --> 06:10:38.960
And I was just thinking about building a new house. This is great

06:10:39.760 --> 06:10:44.400
Imagine moving from a musty old mushroom to a fabulous house like this. It's like a dream come true. I'm glad

06:10:45.600 --> 06:10:47.600
Wait, so you don't want to like do

06:10:48.720 --> 06:10:50.720
any trading

06:10:51.280 --> 06:10:53.280
Okay, so I don't need to come here

06:10:54.400 --> 06:10:56.400
I didn't need to come here

06:10:56.880 --> 06:11:02.400
Isn't that funny right here right at this exact geo location? I didn't need to come here

06:11:03.760 --> 06:11:05.760
I need one more heart

06:11:05.760 --> 06:11:07.760
I need one more heart

06:11:08.480 --> 06:11:14.880
Those cabinets they move all the time doesn't notice or doesn't care and I'm sure that she is zooed out her mind on her blue juice

06:11:19.040 --> 06:11:22.320
Hot smash for nothing literally. I thought the game was like you have to go here

06:11:22.880 --> 06:11:26.560
Right, we'll roll one more gacha. Oh, that was really cool. I'm gonna go do that game like

06:11:28.640 --> 06:11:30.720
Right one more gacha because we have enough for it

06:11:31.440 --> 06:11:38.160
How many shells all the shells the probability is six percent if I don't hand over the shells

06:11:39.040 --> 06:11:41.520
Minish need a visit again. Yes, they do

06:11:42.720 --> 06:11:48.960
Okay, we'll visit the minish and then we'll go to the top of the forest because there was a few bits and bobs that the forest have

06:11:48.960 --> 06:11:50.160
No done

06:11:50.160 --> 06:11:54.640
Yeah, I need to go north as soon as I enter a spike spiny choo choo

06:11:54.640 --> 06:11:56.640
I

06:11:56.880 --> 06:11:59.680
Was this is spiky what we've got 92

06:12:00.400 --> 06:12:06.560
I don't think that's enough for a hundred percent and I'm not wasting 92 to get one. I've already got sorry, but

06:12:08.480 --> 06:12:12.800
Right the minish need a visit so the visit we the minish we shall

06:12:15.200 --> 06:12:18.640
And then they can tell me what goop they need because they need one more goop

06:12:25.600 --> 06:12:27.600
Um

06:12:28.000 --> 06:12:31.120
When you have a hundred there a new mpc will spawn right

06:12:31.840 --> 06:12:34.880
We're getting incredibly close to that mpc spawn so

06:12:36.320 --> 06:12:42.240
I'm quite happy. Hello. Uh, I'm gonna zoom about this place though. Just to hurry things along a bit

06:12:42.240 --> 06:12:44.240
So

06:12:51.120 --> 06:12:53.360
Oh do we get to watch the flowers blossom

06:12:58.640 --> 06:13:01.920
Oh, they're blue look it's so helpful

06:13:02.560 --> 06:13:08.400
I'm working. I need a red potion to finish. Okay red potion yet. We can definitely get you a red potion

06:13:08.400 --> 06:13:15.360
Please do not worry little minish. We will return back soon when we are all big and ready for some potioning

06:13:16.480 --> 06:13:19.600
Uh speaking of potioning. I actually know exactly where to go to

06:13:20.320 --> 06:13:24.160
Do it because we were gonna head that way. Anyway, so this is actually worked out perfectly

06:13:25.040 --> 06:13:26.720
and

06:13:26.720 --> 06:13:30.080
I'm gonna do a little bit of this way the flowers

06:13:31.680 --> 06:13:33.680
I do

06:13:34.080 --> 06:13:38.560
Um, I'm very interested to see what kind of shitty games I can come up with

06:13:39.280 --> 06:13:42.960
If I do end up doing the the game pair the root thing

06:13:44.240 --> 06:13:45.440
Uh

06:13:45.440 --> 06:13:46.880
Be curious

06:13:46.880 --> 06:13:52.240
Because I do like I like the progression games where like you make a visible difference in the game

06:13:53.040 --> 06:13:58.960
But I don't know if everyone likes that. I was like, oh, I can't believe I'm probably gonna end up making games for girls only girls

06:14:00.480 --> 06:14:02.480
No boy gamers alone

06:14:03.440 --> 06:14:04.480
No

06:14:04.480 --> 06:14:06.480
Okay, let's beat the absolute

06:14:06.800 --> 06:14:11.680
Yeah, take it take it little octordal thing. I've already forgotten how to spell your name

06:14:13.760 --> 06:14:18.400
Yeah, that's right. Give me them rooms mirrors, but this is where

06:14:21.440 --> 06:14:23.440
The what now the game developer

06:14:25.040 --> 06:14:31.440
What's that? I can't stop and I must do a billion projects that wants to overwhelm myself. Uh, I would like this, please

06:14:33.200 --> 06:14:40.160
And 150 I don't have an empty ball feign feign. What's this? Give me this. What are the practices?

06:14:44.080 --> 06:14:46.080
Okay, I mean I'll take it sure

06:14:47.280 --> 06:14:53.440
Yes, give me that red shape. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. Uh, do you want to trade fusion stones?

06:14:55.360 --> 06:14:59.680
Back for granny's red potion one sip will have you absolutely

06:15:00.320 --> 06:15:05.120
Fucking jacking. Oh, sorry granny. Jeez. What's going on with you?

06:15:05.840 --> 06:15:12.960
Oh, forgive me. Sorry. Sometimes I forget to buy inhibitions. Jeez granny. That was kind of weird. Don't do that again. Okay, sorry

06:15:15.120 --> 06:15:17.120
Would it be

06:15:18.480 --> 06:15:20.800
Maybe faster go another way, but you know what?

06:15:21.760 --> 06:15:23.760
I don't mind. Look

06:15:24.160 --> 06:15:30.240
This stream was only meant to be four hours and we've accidentally turned it into an endurance stream. Oh, no. What problem?

06:15:30.800 --> 06:15:34.480
What what shame that you have to listen to me ramble even more? Oh

06:15:35.280 --> 06:15:39.440
Life is filled with woes and mysteries. No, no the jargon portions the blue one

06:15:41.920 --> 06:15:44.080
What color are viagra pills?

06:15:45.840 --> 06:15:47.840
Like viagra fall pills

06:15:48.880 --> 06:15:51.200
Or did they come in a different array of colors?

06:15:53.760 --> 06:15:55.760
I

06:15:57.280 --> 06:15:59.600
Don't us on goal. I just send you the ever

06:16:04.080 --> 06:16:07.920
They're blue only three more hours until mercy. Okay three hour

06:16:08.000 --> 06:16:11.680
We've got three hour timer to complete this damn game so we can read into mercy

06:16:13.520 --> 06:16:16.160
Yes, I got you red potion darlin. It's all yours

06:16:17.360 --> 06:16:21.680
Well, thanks. We just need to make come back later. Okay. I will come back later

06:16:22.400 --> 06:16:26.640
Right, let's check the map for what we can do

06:16:28.800 --> 06:16:34.000
Nothing is highlighted there. Nothing's highlighted there. What about the lake?

06:16:37.120 --> 06:16:39.120
Nothing on the lake is highlighted

06:16:40.640 --> 06:16:42.640
Nothing in this area is highlighted

06:16:43.680 --> 06:16:46.800
Western world two trees have moved up

06:16:47.360 --> 06:16:54.880
Windrunes there was something we also missed something in the caster winds, but the claiming we actually

06:16:55.280 --> 06:16:58.400
Didn't miss anything which I'm glad because that location is

06:17:00.000 --> 06:17:01.280
stinky, uh

06:17:01.280 --> 06:17:03.280
the castello

06:17:03.280 --> 06:17:06.960
Waterfall definitely haven't explored the waterfall properly

06:17:08.800 --> 06:17:10.480
The ranch

06:17:10.480 --> 06:17:13.040
Gideons we haven't finished yet. We might have to

06:17:13.120 --> 06:17:14.320
Do

06:17:14.320 --> 06:17:16.320
See she's asking the post office

06:17:19.280 --> 06:17:22.320
I think maybe we just need to talk to that wife and then she'll stop

06:17:23.040 --> 06:17:24.240
bleeding

06:17:24.240 --> 06:17:26.240
Right, who am I going with?

06:17:26.560 --> 06:17:31.760
First western world two trees fell windrunes and swamp

06:17:32.080 --> 06:17:37.600
I think swamp that was literally the only thing that we missed so we might actually go back to swamp, you know that

06:17:38.480 --> 06:17:43.840
And then we'll come back and finish off whatever is going on. Azura is live now. Are they both still on?

06:17:48.960 --> 06:17:51.680
That game. Yeah, that game. Yeah jellybean game

06:17:52.800 --> 06:17:56.000
You missed the grave keepers instructions for directions through the wood

06:17:56.960 --> 06:17:58.960
Oh, is that a secret?

06:17:58.960 --> 06:18:02.640
No, the collab finish Azura is on one shot. She's addicted to one shot

06:18:02.640 --> 06:18:05.600
I don't even know what one shot is. I've never heard of it since she's playing

06:18:06.240 --> 06:18:11.040
Oh, I'm glad they had fun. I'll need to check out and actually watch them. So I'm sure there's a giggle first

06:18:13.520 --> 06:18:16.480
The graveyard guy gave some special instructions

06:18:17.920 --> 06:18:19.920
Right, we're big again

06:18:19.920 --> 06:18:23.040
We're gonna go back to the swamp because there's two things we missed in the swamp

06:18:24.240 --> 06:18:27.680
The mage has a hidden path. I would never have guessed to do the hidden path

06:18:27.680 --> 06:18:32.160
I would have been like oh that guy's like actually losing it. He doesn't know what he's talking about hydration check

06:18:35.760 --> 06:18:37.760
Um

06:18:39.120 --> 06:18:43.360
I would actually be faster to do the the one that's here

06:18:44.960 --> 06:18:47.360
I can't remember what it was

06:18:48.160 --> 06:18:50.160
But there's something here

06:18:50.800 --> 06:18:52.800
I think it was a wee minish

06:18:57.760 --> 06:19:02.160
Oh my god, I I checked twitter. Thank you for everyone who like interacts with me on twitter

06:19:02.160 --> 06:19:06.320

06:19:06.880 --> 06:19:13.520

Um, and I was like, oh my god, you're listening to this. We'll try to focus. How the fucking you focus

06:19:25.920 --> 06:19:27.920
Um, that was good funny

06:19:28.240 --> 06:19:32.880
Or I found it funny. Anyway, I found out tiki hilarious me. I'm a little think I'm a little think things funny

06:19:32.880 --> 06:19:35.040
Okay, I'm a little too. I'm a lot of go tiki

06:19:35.840 --> 06:19:37.840
If this is going to be the beanpole

06:19:38.400 --> 06:19:41.600
Fun fact blue wd is actually about by bagbra

06:19:42.640 --> 06:19:44.640
It's about niacra falls

06:19:45.360 --> 06:19:48.880
It wasn't true. It's true. It wasn't true. Are you making up fibbers?

06:19:50.400 --> 06:19:55.040
Are you making up fibbers, huh? Are you telling us fibbers? I believe it. I'm gonna I'm gonna end up believing you

06:19:55.840 --> 06:20:00.880
It leaves you harder, right? So is this just a debate these two ones are

06:20:02.880 --> 06:20:05.040
I mean, it looks like there are debate. There's nothing to go in

06:20:06.800 --> 06:20:09.600
Oh, he fibbing. All right, right. Get on boys jump on

06:20:12.560 --> 06:20:14.560
Pile up on I'm reefing

06:20:15.760 --> 06:20:17.760
Tickle the crap out of this man

06:20:18.000 --> 06:20:24.560
Me when me when I do some mischievous false spreading of information on the internet

06:20:26.000 --> 06:20:30.240
Well, there's definitely a bean here, but I don't know how to activate it

06:20:33.520 --> 06:20:35.520
Well, I'm an ish cavern

06:20:38.160 --> 06:20:41.600

It's like sorry. Don't know what a hashtag is. Sorry. You're trying to search that. Sorry never heard of it before and I'm like

06:20:47.120 --> 06:20:49.120

I like honestly give up

06:20:51.680 --> 06:20:53.680
Is there anything special up there? No

06:20:54.480 --> 06:21:00.080
Right, we will do the lily pad leaf which oh that was well like that shortcut do that again

06:21:08.480 --> 06:21:13.040
Right, we need to go all the way like back ish

06:21:13.200 --> 06:21:20.720
Yeah, we need to like go up become small and then take the other so

06:21:25.360 --> 06:21:27.360
Prankham John. Yeah, you're doing

06:21:30.000 --> 06:21:32.000
Uh, I actually need to take this

06:21:32.800 --> 06:21:34.800
Right

06:21:38.320 --> 06:21:44.560
I don't know I'll just let him come after me because he's literally that slow we can just do that

06:21:49.200 --> 06:21:51.200
How do we

06:21:52.400 --> 06:21:54.880
Oh, I didn't need to actually do anything

06:21:55.920 --> 06:21:58.800
Okay, become we go down and then go down down like

06:21:59.040 --> 06:22:01.040
I'm falling down

06:22:01.120 --> 06:22:03.120
I'm too slow

06:22:04.720 --> 06:22:07.600
It's sounding like you shadow man

06:22:09.920 --> 06:22:16.720
Oh shadow. Yeah, no, I'm not even surprised although. I haven't even done anything outrageous on it yet

06:22:17.680 --> 06:22:19.680
That part comes later. Okay

06:22:20.240 --> 06:22:22.240
Oh

06:22:26.400 --> 06:22:28.400
This better be worth it

06:22:29.120 --> 06:22:31.120
It's a kinstone piece

06:22:31.200 --> 06:22:36.880
I mean, I guess it's worth it, but it took me like forever to get here and I'm out

06:22:37.280 --> 06:22:39.760
Oh, I just got stabbed by the plant and now I'm here

06:22:41.360 --> 06:22:43.840
Can I even out jeez louise?

06:22:44.720 --> 06:22:46.720
The game tested that section

06:22:47.680 --> 06:22:50.960
Right. Okay. Now we need to go back and become big

06:22:57.680 --> 06:23:03.920
Okay, and then I think everything in this area is thankfully done. If not something you'll unlock but we'll know about it

06:23:04.960 --> 06:23:06.960
It's later up. No not birds

06:23:07.440 --> 06:23:09.440
Oh true

06:23:09.440 --> 06:23:11.440
Oh, yeah, you like that. Yeah

06:23:11.760 --> 06:23:16.560
Sorry, I'm losing it. I'm losing it a little bit. Maybe I should get something to eat again

06:23:17.600 --> 06:23:21.280
I didn't I didn't think I was gonna be streaming for long because I'm not really eating anything

06:23:21.920 --> 06:23:23.920
Eh, right. We're gonna go to the rave yard

06:23:24.160 --> 06:23:28.480
Um, and listen to what the old man's pathing was

06:23:32.560 --> 06:23:34.560
I actually don't know what his pathing was

06:23:37.440 --> 06:23:39.440
Oh, that was a direct hit jeez

06:23:41.440 --> 06:23:43.440
A quick little snackie

06:23:45.200 --> 06:23:49.200
You can eat me out. That's not that's not even subtle. That wasn't even subtle at all

06:23:52.480 --> 06:23:57.840
Uh, what is it? It was left left left up up up. Okay, we can do that

06:24:00.000 --> 06:24:02.000
Oh making another baby loaf

06:24:02.400 --> 06:24:05.760
Bro, my loafs of bread are are just no having it

06:24:07.360 --> 06:24:09.360
I would like to spawn a loaf of bread please

06:24:09.600 --> 06:24:13.920
Right, let's see. It was left left left up up

06:24:15.680 --> 06:24:17.680
Left

06:24:19.360 --> 06:24:21.360
Left

06:24:22.880 --> 06:24:24.880
Left

06:24:25.920 --> 06:24:27.920
Up

06:24:29.120 --> 06:24:31.120
Up

06:24:32.240 --> 06:24:34.240
Ow

Wow

06:24:36.960 --> 06:24:38.960
What getcha

06:24:43.920 --> 06:24:45.920
Okay, I'll take it

06:24:46.720 --> 06:24:48.880
But there isn't any more secret on the map here

06:24:50.560 --> 06:24:56.080
Nah, there isn't so who have I not or where have I not done? I just cleared out the swamp

06:25:00.320 --> 06:25:05.840
It's really just doing kinstone pieces. I need people to trade kinstone, but they wouldn't stay not in the kinstone

06:25:06.480 --> 06:25:12.160
Maybe the folk maybe the folk in this building will do more kinstone trades with me. Hold on. We're gonna quickly

06:25:13.440 --> 06:25:14.560
Um

06:25:14.560 --> 06:25:16.560
Fly away and see if we can get kinstone

06:25:17.440 --> 06:25:19.440
pieces

06:25:20.400 --> 06:25:24.560

06:25:27.280 --> 06:25:29.520
You get you guys need any heart medication

06:25:30.800 --> 06:25:32.960

06:25:33.760 --> 06:25:37.360
Sorry, sir. Looks like I accidentally gave you the wrong dose

06:25:38.480 --> 06:25:42.320
But I can't leave you like this. That's too inappropriate

06:25:44.160 --> 06:25:48.160
Please sir, let me make the situation right. Don't report me. Okay

06:25:50.400 --> 06:25:53.040
I need to keep my license. I need to pay my rent

06:25:55.840 --> 06:25:57.840
Mummy's old natural heart

06:25:58.800 --> 06:26:05.680
I'd be up for that. Oh, yeah, you'd be up. All right. Uh, it wouldn't be a choice really. Do you want to trade?

06:26:08.160 --> 06:26:10.160
Your heart is so big

06:26:11.280 --> 06:26:14.800
Yeah, you have massive heart all that blood that's pumping

06:26:18.400 --> 06:26:20.960
I'm sure I can watch the screen over here

06:26:23.040 --> 06:26:25.040
I'd be up for three hours

06:26:25.680 --> 06:26:29.680
I cannot wait to start doing project passion project audio

06:26:31.840 --> 06:26:35.360
Right, do you want to trade? Yeah, well, they really do like trading up in these parts

06:26:36.480 --> 06:26:40.320
I think I'm just gonna have to like reset these rooms and keep coming back and forth

06:26:41.200 --> 06:26:45.360
Oh lord, please don't stop. Oh, no, we just finished the rave yard

06:26:49.920 --> 06:26:51.920
Hopefully it's just treasure

06:26:52.000 --> 06:26:56.320
Uh, right, let's go down again

06:26:58.080 --> 06:27:01.520

No one else to trade here

06:27:14.400 --> 06:27:16.640
Jeez, I'm struggling to figure out what to do next

06:27:17.520 --> 06:27:24.480
Our new universe situation is trying us into not telling us and we keep our license. Oh the other way around

06:27:27.200 --> 06:27:30.640
Get them gloves on get them gloves on

06:27:34.480 --> 06:27:37.200
At four hours, you need a big needle in and drain the blood

06:27:37.440 --> 06:27:39.440
Yeah

06:27:40.960 --> 06:27:46.480
Which uh, no, I don't think I'd appreciate that. No, I think I'd be rather adverse to that if I'm being honest with you

06:27:48.080 --> 06:27:50.320
Call strong if it goes past five birth. I'll help out

06:27:52.480 --> 06:27:55.760

Hooker inspector

06:30:06.640 --> 06:30:08.960
Okay, the gambodiction is real

06:30:12.560 --> 06:30:16.320
Oh wait, you didn't dock with the big gorgon at top of the wind temple

06:30:23.200 --> 06:30:25.200
Right you

06:30:25.680 --> 06:30:27.200

Well, do get to it. Well, he really said get gamble

Right to the minnish village

06:30:55.600 --> 06:30:57.600
Oh

06:31:03.040 --> 06:31:05.040
And you don't want to fuse

06:31:06.480 --> 06:31:09.520
Fine, I'll take it. You don't want to fuse with me

06:31:10.240 --> 06:31:15.760
I'm actually going to swim to that other one across the water again because I felt like something should have been there

06:31:15.840 --> 06:31:18.000
And maybe I missed it, but I just felt so

06:31:20.320 --> 06:31:22.320
You guys don't want to fuse in general, do you?

06:31:22.640 --> 06:31:26.240
No, it seems like special the minnish views. Oh, no

06:31:29.120 --> 06:31:31.120
I'm too early

06:31:31.520 --> 06:31:33.520
Are you sure this hasn't bloomed?

06:31:33.840 --> 06:31:37.120
Well, I'm not calling you a liar because I can see the flowers haven't but

06:31:38.400 --> 06:31:41.520
Wow, I've been away for a hot second mate. I'm not gonna lie

06:31:42.560 --> 06:31:44.560
And being away for a wee bit

06:31:44.960 --> 06:31:47.760
Is there anyone in that minnish house outside the village?

06:31:48.720 --> 06:31:52.080
Is there anyone in the in that minnish house that's outside the village?

06:31:52.400 --> 06:31:57.520
Yeah, there was one in it, but he wouldn't trade me like I don't he didn't have a kinswoman or anything

06:31:59.280 --> 06:32:01.920
I'll go talk to him again because I thought it was a bit sauce

06:32:02.000 --> 06:32:04.480
No, I did get a heart from here. So that wasn't that bad

06:32:04.880 --> 06:32:08.480
But he was like wow, I don't normally get visitors here and I'm like, well

06:32:09.760 --> 06:32:11.760
Good job finding this place

06:32:11.840 --> 06:32:13.840
That's it

06:32:14.800 --> 06:32:18.240
Oh, I like that they follow you around. Oh, look at their tails

06:32:27.440 --> 06:32:31.440
He's not the one I meant I meant the one by the shrink

06:32:35.120 --> 06:32:40.800
He's the bomb guy I have done it a few times with the bomb guy

06:32:44.400 --> 06:32:46.400
I don't want

06:32:46.720 --> 06:32:49.200
Let's check since we're too early

06:32:50.480 --> 06:32:52.480
Let me go check

06:32:59.280 --> 06:33:01.280

I'd like to ask just to make sure strongy would you be okay if I cosplay do yeah, sure

06:33:06.960 --> 06:33:08.960
Uh

06:33:09.280 --> 06:33:13.920
The white on my outfit is pearlescent. That's my only good luck hint because

06:33:14.800 --> 06:33:17.520
I don't know how hard it is to source pearlescent material, but

06:33:19.280 --> 06:33:21.280
Huh, right, let's check the HUD

06:33:22.160 --> 06:33:24.480
We haven't really done much on the waterfall

06:33:25.920 --> 06:33:32.960
I think we'll do the waterfall that seems like the most logical thing to do right now whilst we wait for our little um

06:33:36.960 --> 06:33:38.960
I

06:33:40.560 --> 06:33:46.240
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to shoot that inside the uh, the town we're able to top right

06:33:47.280 --> 06:33:49.040
Oh, nope

06:33:49.040 --> 06:33:52.720
When pointing my sword tree in that hole there

06:33:53.840 --> 06:33:55.840

06:33:56.240 --> 06:33:58.240
Right, let's do this

06:33:59.440 --> 06:34:01.440
Nope, let's not do this currently

06:34:02.560 --> 06:34:05.440
Uh, oh, it's this cavern. Okay

06:34:06.880 --> 06:34:08.880
I napped and I woke up again

06:34:20.880 --> 06:34:22.880

Have not opened up that waterfall so it's not that one

06:34:36.000 --> 06:34:42.160
Oh, there's a chest there though. Do you have gacha currency? I could have flown here

06:34:43.600 --> 06:34:48.240
Oh, I'm getting absolutely annihilated. Um, he pushed me off the oh my god

06:34:55.200 --> 06:34:57.520
The insects are winning the insects are actually winning

06:34:58.560 --> 06:35:04.320
Right, right, that's it. I can't even charge it up to do a spin attack. Oh my god. I'm actually gonna die

06:35:05.360 --> 06:35:07.680
No way. I'm gonna die. Stop

06:35:08.320 --> 06:35:12.960
Right, that's it. We need to suck off these other ones unless he like jumps off. No. Oh my god

06:35:12.960 --> 06:35:14.960
I just keep spawning in more enemies

06:35:16.000 --> 06:35:20.000

I'm getting jumped by everyone all at once

06:35:58.800 --> 06:36:00.800
No, I get in the water

06:36:01.120 --> 06:36:03.120
Fuck off me bam

06:36:03.840 --> 06:36:05.840

Oh, that's exactly what I needed. Thank you. You've completed a new heart container. Thank gosh. So there's only what 12 on the map somewhere

06:36:15.520 --> 06:36:17.520
That was awful

06:36:17.520 --> 06:36:19.520
I'm getting freaking annihilated there

06:36:19.680 --> 06:36:26.080
You phone there you wouldn't know there's a bomb room in the cave you just got

06:36:29.120 --> 06:36:33.360
Wait, that was real. I thought it wasn't real. I knew it was hard to know

06:36:35.200 --> 06:36:37.200
I was like, huh

Did you end up getting that red kinson piece for the tingle brother? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got all the tingleys

06:36:45.040 --> 06:36:50.960
I cannot for the life of me remember what I'm supposed to do right. No, no go up the stairs

06:36:53.680 --> 06:36:55.680
And go along

06:37:00.640 --> 06:37:02.640
These are all in my way

06:37:03.440 --> 06:37:07.360
Right. Thank goodness. I have so much health because I don't have to like contend with everything all at once

06:37:08.160 --> 06:37:10.160

06:37:14.400 --> 06:37:17.440
What does it do? Is he saying far?

06:37:26.480 --> 06:37:30.640
How does he come up? He's hating from me

06:37:38.080 --> 06:37:41.200
He's just making Goro noises throw something at him

06:37:42.160 --> 06:37:47.760
I'm gonna hurt him. Maybe a ball of them. Oh, I can't do anything. I'm completely rocked in

06:37:51.040 --> 06:37:53.040
You have to dock with someone

Good thing I'm not feeling submissive right now. That's right. Wait, there's only one of these left. Is the game gonna remember?

06:38:28.480 --> 06:38:30.480

06:38:32.080 --> 06:38:35.360
He like gets up so quickly that I can't even suck them though

06:38:36.480 --> 06:38:41.040
Mm-hmm right there that dig spot dig dig

06:38:42.720 --> 06:38:44.720

Wait, there's a dig spot back there

Back in here

06:39:04.480 --> 06:39:06.480
Opposite eye of the chest

In here

06:39:14.960 --> 06:39:17.840
Nope outside. Wait, so I was in the right place

06:39:21.040 --> 06:39:23.040
Other eye

06:39:23.760 --> 06:39:25.760
Ah

06:39:29.440 --> 06:39:31.440
That

06:39:31.520 --> 06:39:34.880
You know what I've actually had enough of you mate. There's no way you're gonna survive

06:39:36.320 --> 06:39:38.320
How have you seen refusing to die?

06:39:39.760 --> 06:39:41.760
The rocks are skull shaped

06:39:44.560 --> 06:39:50.000
That's what you want to drink. Stranny you are so blind. I'm getting nuked to death by this thing that I can't kill

06:39:50.800 --> 06:39:53.200
He literally won't even go in the paw

06:39:56.880 --> 06:40:01.680
He's refusing to suck because he's mental so you got to smash him or something

06:40:02.960 --> 06:40:04.960
I'm freaking trying

06:40:06.480 --> 06:40:09.600
Fuck off man. Right. Was that what I was supposed to do?

06:40:11.600 --> 06:40:13.600
Have I done everything that you do in this area?

06:40:14.080 --> 06:40:16.080
I

06:40:17.840 --> 06:40:24.160
I'm seeing guy refused to get sucked. Honestly. Is that everything I had to do this little bit? No stop. It's not no

06:40:27.200 --> 06:40:29.200

First Ronnie still a bomb room left. There's a bomb wall. Where the fire skull was

06:40:44.160 --> 06:40:46.160
Down here down here

06:40:48.160 --> 06:40:50.400
I can see there's something here. I have an access

06:40:53.360 --> 06:40:56.160
On the way down. Yes down. Okay down down I go

06:40:57.600 --> 06:41:02.560
I'm following the reef flingsery flingsery flings are following the reef flings

06:41:03.440 --> 06:41:05.440
Because I am a good girl

06:41:05.520 --> 06:41:06.400

You don't saw that a little bit, but then I never went for it because I was like no, that's silly

06:41:15.120 --> 06:41:19.200
Following the reef flingsery flingsery flingsery flingsery

06:41:20.880 --> 06:41:22.880
They're gonna

06:41:23.760 --> 06:41:25.760
Ski week

06:41:27.760 --> 06:41:29.760
No, no logic puzzle

06:41:33.520 --> 06:41:35.520
Well, I can only push it to the side

06:41:40.320 --> 06:41:43.600
Oh geez how many of you did just spawn?

06:41:50.000 --> 06:41:52.000
If I push it down by one

06:41:55.040 --> 06:41:57.360
I don't ever recall doing this, but

06:41:59.600 --> 06:42:01.600
Oh, that was so tricky. Oh, no

06:42:03.120 --> 06:42:05.120
Yes, we got the shell

06:42:06.400 --> 06:42:08.400
Oh

06:42:08.880 --> 06:42:10.880
Yeah

06:42:13.600 --> 06:42:15.600
Oh shit

06:42:16.560 --> 06:42:18.560
This

06:42:20.080 --> 06:42:22.400
In order to get out. Okay. Okay. I understand

06:42:25.760 --> 06:42:30.640
I saw a go go go go go go. Oh, sorry. Sorry a little brazilis there

06:42:34.080 --> 06:42:36.080
Probably better I don't like go that one

06:42:38.960 --> 06:42:43.680
I did it. I did it. Does the ghost respawn? No he doesn't

06:42:44.880 --> 06:42:46.880
You can teleport

06:42:46.960 --> 06:42:48.240
Probably

06:42:48.240 --> 06:42:54.320
Okay, surely the minish flowers are done by now considering how long that took me to figure out

06:42:55.520 --> 06:42:57.520
Surely

06:42:58.000 --> 06:43:02.480
Surely the minish flower is done by now. There's no way it's not

06:43:04.480 --> 06:43:06.480
Yes

06:43:07.440 --> 06:43:09.440
Surely copy them

06:43:20.800 --> 06:43:23.120
All right, let me get my let me get my speedy goons hours

06:43:24.720 --> 06:43:26.720
They're probably done and don't call me surely

06:43:28.320 --> 06:43:33.760
Do you have a checklist? No, I'm just following the reeflings. I trust the reeflings blindly with my life

06:43:34.720 --> 06:43:37.920
And in exchange they get milked. It's quite a good uh

06:43:39.280 --> 06:43:42.960
Um relationship honestly, I mean, I think

06:43:47.920 --> 06:43:49.920
They're so beautiful

06:43:50.400 --> 06:43:54.000
Look, I succeeded in growing an orange bloom. Thanks for your help. I'm so grateful

06:43:54.800 --> 06:44:00.320
I'm taking a break from research, but I've lots of good ideas super hyper cyber. Which one should I pick first?

06:44:04.000 --> 06:44:09.680
Give me the goods give me the goods. Come on surely you want to give me something for it? Come on

06:44:18.560 --> 06:44:20.400
What did that do

06:44:20.400 --> 06:44:25.280
Did I walk something doing that or do we just have pretty flowers now? Honestly, I ain't that mad

06:44:26.160 --> 06:44:30.240
I ain't that mad. They're they're pretty cute scammed. No, honestly, they're pretty cute

06:44:34.480 --> 06:44:36.480
Uh

06:44:36.800 --> 06:44:38.160
Copy them

06:44:38.160 --> 06:44:42.000
I like flower games like I like games that are like oh the store nature

06:44:42.720 --> 06:44:44.720
Dude in town

06:44:45.360 --> 06:44:47.360
There's no someone in town

06:44:49.440 --> 06:44:51.440
In minnish town

06:44:55.040 --> 06:44:59.040
Your name will go down in history as a flower scientist

06:45:00.000 --> 06:45:03.600
Called botanist. I'm a big botanist. Someone's got booty. I see

06:45:06.720 --> 06:45:08.720
I've got a big round

06:45:13.120 --> 06:45:17.920
Uh, didn't didn't turn cells in there cells flower

06:45:17.920 --> 06:45:19.920
I

06:45:23.920 --> 06:45:25.920
The flowers make me think oh

06:45:27.680 --> 06:45:29.680
Keep toughen away into the evening

06:45:34.480 --> 06:45:41.600
Did it did nothing actually happen other than unlocking these flowers, I mean, that's cute, but

06:45:41.840 --> 06:45:43.840
I

06:45:44.240 --> 06:45:46.240
Flower guy in town

06:45:47.040 --> 06:45:49.040
In minnish town

06:45:53.200 --> 06:45:55.200
You want to trade no

06:45:56.480 --> 06:46:01.520
I've been asking the same people all over and over. Please. Do you want to trade please please?

06:46:02.400 --> 06:46:05.440
I'm getting desperate and castles in high rule

06:46:11.600 --> 06:46:13.600
I

06:46:18.480 --> 06:46:20.480
New guy in town

06:46:24.880 --> 06:46:28.160
I'm looking I'm observing

06:46:30.320 --> 06:46:33.680
There's no new gentleman in time you're teasing me

06:46:38.160 --> 06:46:40.160
No one wants to link them

06:46:42.400 --> 06:46:44.400
Uh

06:46:46.080 --> 06:46:50.720
There is a game where you can dodge the bird if you want I always remember things not funny again

06:46:51.920 --> 06:46:53.920
Oh, it's the library

06:46:54.000 --> 06:46:56.560
Did you jump in the bell? I did jump in the bell

06:46:57.760 --> 06:46:59.760
I'm gonna unlock the next edition

06:47:01.280 --> 06:47:04.720
Welcome. Yes. Yes. Yes. I've almost finished

06:47:06.080 --> 06:47:10.240
Right, we'll go bottom left. No, no, I didn't mean it but thanks. Oh, I appreciate it

06:47:10.880 --> 06:47:17.920
Um, we'll go bottom left and the reason for that is because there was a few dig sites we unlocked

06:47:19.760 --> 06:47:22.480
Uh, there's a up here

06:47:26.080 --> 06:47:28.240
Man, just let me cut the grass in peace. Okay

06:47:29.680 --> 06:47:36.320
Some of us need to to feed their gacha habit and if I'm going to fund it by cutting grass then just leave me to it

06:47:36.320 --> 06:47:39.360
Okay. Oh, there we go. That's what we'll see. Wee

06:47:40.880 --> 06:47:42.880
Okay

06:47:44.480 --> 06:47:46.480
All right fallen trees

06:47:48.160 --> 06:47:50.160
All right, this one's

06:47:51.680 --> 06:47:53.680
Wow

06:47:54.240 --> 06:47:56.240
Soon soon

06:47:56.320 --> 06:47:59.840
Wait, that was a swamp. That was the guy's house

06:48:02.560 --> 06:48:07.040
And then this one did we dig up we might have already done that

06:48:07.760 --> 06:48:12.960
A bomb place. How do you guys spot the bomb places so easily?

06:48:14.480 --> 06:48:16.480
A bomb place

06:48:17.520 --> 06:48:19.520
Oops, a bomb place

06:48:20.320 --> 06:48:22.320
That's here

06:48:25.680 --> 06:48:27.680
A bomb place

06:48:27.680 --> 06:48:38.960
Can you be this zero in a bit? I've already been in here

06:48:44.080 --> 06:48:46.080
Nope to the right

06:48:50.720 --> 06:48:52.720
Aww

06:48:53.440 --> 06:48:55.440
Oh

06:48:58.000 --> 06:49:01.040
Get in the bowl, hen. Thank you

06:49:04.640 --> 06:49:08.240
She's me just going for a dip plus I watch you lovely ladies flutter about

06:49:11.680 --> 06:49:15.440
I still don't get how you guys see that honestly. I would never have caught that

06:49:16.960 --> 06:49:18.960
Um

06:49:18.960 --> 06:49:44.960
We can dig this up, nice, nice, huge, is that everything for the sweet region here?

06:49:45.960 --> 06:49:46.960
It was?

06:49:47.960 --> 06:49:48.960
Oops, sorry.

06:49:49.960 --> 06:49:51.960
Is that literally everything I've unlocked?

06:49:51.960 --> 06:49:55.960
I just need to fuse stones with people, but I don't know where they're located, basically.

06:49:58.960 --> 06:50:00.960
Hold on, just checking.

06:50:01.960 --> 06:50:06.960
Right, I need to finish the post office, and I need to talk to that wife and get a charm off of her.

06:50:06.960 --> 06:50:10.960
I need to finish the gacha, which I'm literally about to do.

06:50:10.960 --> 06:50:15.960
I've not finished off the gorom, which is a shame.

06:50:16.960 --> 06:50:18.960
The lake, apparently, is finished off.

06:50:24.960 --> 06:50:29.960
Bro, I'm just shite, as it clearly is.

06:50:31.960 --> 06:50:34.960
Is there any mythical features in Foch Foch, or tons?

06:50:34.960 --> 06:50:36.960
Kelpies are probably the most well-known.

06:50:37.960 --> 06:50:38.960
Um...

06:50:41.960 --> 06:50:46.960
Kelpies are horses that convince you to ride their back, and then you drown.

06:50:46.960 --> 06:50:48.960
So basically, like, marry me.

06:50:49.960 --> 06:50:50.960
Um...

06:50:51.960 --> 06:50:53.960
Right, we have 300 rupees.

06:50:53.960 --> 06:50:57.960
Let's go talk to this wife, and let's go get the latest issue.

06:50:58.960 --> 06:51:00.960
We've got one more?

06:51:00.960 --> 06:51:02.960
Hello, we've got a new issue, yes?

06:51:02.960 --> 06:51:04.960
Yes, thank you, I would like it.

06:51:07.960 --> 06:51:14.960
Um, right, we're actually going to purposefully fail a gacha, so we can make 10 rupees.

06:51:14.960 --> 06:51:18.960
I've got 190, and it's 200 for an addition.

06:51:18.960 --> 06:51:20.960
So we're going to purposefully fail this, okay?

06:51:22.960 --> 06:51:25.960
We're going to purposefully fail this, please don't worry.

06:51:25.960 --> 06:51:27.960
It is all by design.

06:51:28.960 --> 06:51:31.960
The difference is Kelpies eat you after you drown.

06:51:31.960 --> 06:51:33.960
Marry me to do that too.

06:51:33.960 --> 06:51:34.960
Yeah, that's fine.

06:51:34.960 --> 06:51:35.960
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

06:51:35.960 --> 06:51:38.960
Okay, we need one, we just need to fail one more.

06:51:38.960 --> 06:51:41.960
And before I win it, could you imagine?

06:51:41.960 --> 06:51:44.960
I curse you with good luck, 3% probability.

06:51:45.960 --> 06:51:47.960
That would be blessed.

06:51:50.960 --> 06:51:54.960
You raid their back and they drown you, basically.

06:51:54.960 --> 06:51:58.960
So Kelpies are like, marry me to drown you in water.

06:52:00.960 --> 06:52:01.960
How many shells, right?

06:52:01.960 --> 06:52:03.960
Let's get to work.

06:52:05.960 --> 06:52:11.960
It's a hippocampus, so it murders in time.

06:52:11.960 --> 06:52:15.960
Name to eat shells to get one correct gacha.

06:52:17.960 --> 06:52:20.960
The classic red cap goblin is also a Scottish myth.

06:52:22.960 --> 06:52:25.960
Big blue choo-choo appears in the temple of the droplet.

06:52:25.960 --> 06:52:28.960
It's an ordinary blue choo-choo, faking him, minnish sizes, daunting.

06:52:28.960 --> 06:52:30.960
Just try to avoid the electric.

06:52:31.960 --> 06:52:36.960
Congrats, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime.

06:52:37.960 --> 06:52:38.960
Wanna try again?

06:52:38.960 --> 06:52:41.960
Yes, I think I have enough, question mark.

06:52:48.960 --> 06:52:49.960
We do have enough.

06:52:50.960 --> 06:52:52.960
Yes, name to eat, give me that little lever.

06:52:54.960 --> 06:52:56.960
Kelpies are squashful.

06:52:57.960 --> 06:53:01.960
King Daltas.

06:53:02.960 --> 06:53:05.960
Congratulations, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime.

06:53:05.960 --> 06:53:06.960
Do we have enough?

06:53:06.960 --> 06:53:08.960
We do have enough for another roll.

06:53:08.960 --> 06:53:09.960
Wanna try again?

06:53:09.960 --> 06:53:11.960
I absolutely would love to.

06:53:11.960 --> 06:53:12.960
Yes, please.

06:53:12.960 --> 06:53:13.960
Oh, no.

06:53:13.960 --> 06:53:14.960
Oh, well.

06:53:14.960 --> 06:53:16.960
Okay, 2% gacha.

06:53:16.960 --> 06:53:18.960
Wish us luck.

06:53:18.960 --> 06:53:20.960
2% gacha.

06:53:21.960 --> 06:53:23.960
Yeah, surprise, surprise.

06:53:23.960 --> 06:53:25.960
Yeah, I don't think so.

06:53:25.960 --> 06:53:29.960
I think there's legit like 4 missing.

06:53:30.960 --> 06:53:32.960
1, 2, 3.

06:53:46.960 --> 06:53:48.960
3, wow.

06:53:48.960 --> 06:53:50.960
Okay, 3 more.

06:53:51.960 --> 06:53:54.960
2% is better odds than a gacha 5 star.

06:53:56.960 --> 06:53:59.960
Well, after this, it's literally 2 more and we're done.

06:53:59.960 --> 06:54:00.960
We are done with gacha.

06:54:00.960 --> 06:54:03.960
We can finally access that room.

06:54:07.960 --> 06:54:10.960
The third last one is...

06:54:11.960 --> 06:54:13.960
Aw, Ren's sleep.

06:54:13.960 --> 06:54:14.960
Ren's shoe shop.

06:54:14.960 --> 06:54:16.960
Using a secret technique, he makes shoes in his sleep.

06:54:16.960 --> 06:54:18.960
Princess Zelda is his thing.

06:54:18.960 --> 06:54:21.960
His biggest source of income.

06:54:21.960 --> 06:54:22.960
That's cute.

06:54:22.960 --> 06:54:23.960
Okay.

06:54:23.960 --> 06:54:28.960
We are out of shells so we can't do it again until we get a few more.

06:54:28.960 --> 06:54:31.960
But literally 2 more to go feels good, man.

06:54:34.960 --> 06:54:36.960
Oh, hello, Popper.

06:54:36.960 --> 06:54:37.960
You're in the way.

06:54:37.960 --> 06:54:38.960
In the way.

06:54:38.960 --> 06:54:39.960
Yeah.

06:54:39.960 --> 06:54:40.960
Nope, you're straight back in the way.

06:54:40.960 --> 06:54:41.960
Yep, there you go.

06:54:42.960 --> 06:54:43.960
Oh, wait.

06:54:43.960 --> 06:54:46.960
We're gonna talk to her so she gives us her blessing thing

06:54:46.960 --> 06:54:48.960
because she does...

06:54:48.960 --> 06:54:49.960
Yes.

06:54:51.960 --> 06:54:55.960
We're just gonna use that so she can give me the charm.

06:54:56.960 --> 06:54:57.960
What does it do?

06:54:58.960 --> 06:55:00.960
Blue Link can't hurt you.

06:55:00.960 --> 06:55:02.960
He isn't real Blue Link.

06:55:03.960 --> 06:55:04.960
That is cursed.

06:55:05.960 --> 06:55:08.960
And last but not least, yes, give me it.

06:55:08.960 --> 06:55:10.960
And then that's fully gone.

06:55:13.960 --> 06:55:14.960
All done.

06:55:14.960 --> 06:55:15.960
What do you see now?

06:55:15.960 --> 06:55:17.960
You now have the full collection of layers,

06:55:17.960 --> 06:55:20.960
but I guess you must know all kinds of stuff now, huh, Professor?

06:55:21.960 --> 06:55:22.960
Are you flirting with me?

06:55:22.960 --> 06:55:23.960
I will...

06:55:24.960 --> 06:55:26.960
I will perish right now.

06:55:28.960 --> 06:55:29.960
Let's see.

06:55:32.960 --> 06:55:34.960
No one...

06:55:36.960 --> 06:55:40.960
No one wants to link our cheeky stones.

06:55:40.960 --> 06:55:43.960
I'm really struggling to find anyone who wants to do it.

06:55:45.960 --> 06:55:46.960
Read.

06:55:46.960 --> 06:55:48.960
Do you want me to read?

06:55:49.960 --> 06:55:51.960
Oh, I'll go and take another one.

06:55:56.960 --> 06:55:58.960
Purple Burglar Alarm Link.

06:56:00.960 --> 06:56:02.960
No, you don't want to trade either.

06:56:06.960 --> 06:56:10.960
You still need to buy the Goron...

06:56:16.960 --> 06:56:17.960
What?

06:56:19.960 --> 06:56:21.960
Did I really have nowhere else to go?

06:56:23.960 --> 06:56:26.960
I don't know if I should just go back to that field and farm it,

06:56:26.960 --> 06:56:28.960
that one that's like to the west.

06:56:29.960 --> 06:56:32.960
Did you dock with the Minish in the bookshelf?

06:56:33.960 --> 06:56:34.960
I think so.

06:56:35.960 --> 06:56:37.960
I'll just go back to make sure.

06:56:37.960 --> 06:56:38.960
Make sure.

06:56:43.960 --> 06:56:46.960
I've seen games with a 1 in 15,000 drop.

06:56:46.960 --> 06:56:49.960
See, that just like completely turns me off.

06:56:49.960 --> 06:56:52.960
I'm like, well, I'm without lucky, so what's the point?

06:56:52.960 --> 06:56:54.960
I wouldn't even spend my pennies on it.

06:56:54.960 --> 06:56:56.960
I'll see if there's any we Minish.

06:56:56.960 --> 06:56:58.960
Actually, I do need to go back to the mining village

06:56:58.960 --> 06:57:03.960
because I think there possibly had been someone that might want to...

06:57:03.960 --> 06:57:06.960
Oh, there's a wee guy up there, maybe he wants to...

06:57:07.960 --> 06:57:08.960
You're still playing this.

06:57:09.960 --> 06:57:10.960
I went to bed when you started.

06:57:10.960 --> 06:57:12.960
Well, you must have got a terrible sleep.

06:57:12.960 --> 06:57:14.960
There's only been seven hours, you need eight.

06:57:16.960 --> 06:57:18.960
Okay, we'll go back.

06:57:18.960 --> 06:57:20.960
We'll go back to the mines after this.

06:57:20.960 --> 06:57:22.960
The children yearn for the mines.

06:57:31.960 --> 06:57:32.960
I did have a terrible sleep.

06:57:32.960 --> 06:57:33.960
Exactly, see?

06:57:34.960 --> 06:57:37.960
Reminds me of how I thought I could get the woodcutting pen.

06:57:41.960 --> 06:57:43.960
Oh, so you passed the trial and returned.

06:57:43.960 --> 06:57:44.960
I'm so jealous.

06:57:44.960 --> 06:57:46.960
But if you're going on an adventure,

06:57:46.960 --> 06:57:48.960
there's no one better to learn for the elder.

06:57:48.960 --> 06:57:51.960
He's so manly, so rivally, and so full of fire.

06:57:53.960 --> 06:57:54.960
Oh, it's green though.

06:57:55.960 --> 06:57:59.960
It's not very important if it's green, unless I'm mistaken.

06:58:00.960 --> 06:58:02.960
Oh, I'm not back at the swamp.

06:58:02.960 --> 06:58:05.960
Come on, have you never been to the swamp so many times?

06:58:05.960 --> 06:58:07.960
No, it's just for jewelry.

06:58:08.960 --> 06:58:09.960
Jewelry for gems.

06:58:11.960 --> 06:58:12.960
Well done indeed.

06:58:12.960 --> 06:58:14.960
You're almost as surprised as I was at your age.

06:58:16.960 --> 06:58:17.960
How about again?

06:58:17.960 --> 06:58:18.960
No?

06:58:21.960 --> 06:58:24.960
No, I can only do it once and it was green.

06:58:24.960 --> 06:58:26.960
I wasn't even an important one.

06:58:27.960 --> 06:58:29.960
Get out of my swamp.

06:58:29.960 --> 06:58:31.960
I mean, honestly, we're what?

06:58:31.960 --> 06:58:33.960
Missing three heart containers?

06:58:34.960 --> 06:58:35.960
That's not that bad.

06:58:35.960 --> 06:58:36.960
It could be way worse.

06:58:39.960 --> 06:58:41.960
I feel like three heart containers is pretty good.

06:58:41.960 --> 06:58:43.960
I actually have no clue what I'm missing, but...

06:58:46.960 --> 06:58:47.960
Maybe.

06:58:48.960 --> 06:58:50.960
Just maybe we do the boss.

06:58:50.960 --> 06:58:51.960
Because when does Mercy come on?

06:58:51.960 --> 06:58:54.960
We've got T minus two hours for Mercy, so...

06:58:57.960 --> 06:58:59.960
I will get the last gacha, though.

06:58:59.960 --> 06:59:01.960
I want to do the gacha part.

06:59:01.960 --> 06:59:03.960
Addicted, I know.

06:59:03.960 --> 06:59:06.960
I'm gonna cut grass for the gacha.

06:59:07.960 --> 06:59:09.960
I can't believe I'm saying this one.

06:59:09.960 --> 06:59:11.960
I'm a way to cut grass for gacha.

06:59:20.960 --> 06:59:22.960
Oh my god, that's when you know it's bad.

06:59:22.960 --> 06:59:24.960
Start doing manual labor.

06:59:27.960 --> 06:59:28.960
Terrible.

06:59:28.960 --> 06:59:30.960
They're not dropping anything.

06:59:33.960 --> 06:59:35.960
As if he hits me.

06:59:38.960 --> 06:59:40.960
See, these guys are so in awe.

06:59:40.960 --> 06:59:42.960
Go and just perish me.

06:59:44.960 --> 06:59:47.960
I need 200 coins to buy 30 more.

06:59:52.960 --> 06:59:55.960
This is gonna take forever this way.

06:59:56.960 --> 06:59:59.960
Why didn't you get the rest of the red rupees at the bean?

06:59:59.960 --> 07:00:01.960
Oh, I don't know where that bean is.

07:00:01.960 --> 07:00:05.960
My inventory was full, so I didn't want to pick up anymore.

07:00:11.960 --> 07:00:13.960
Me wallet was full.

07:00:13.960 --> 07:00:14.960
Can't believe it.

07:00:15.960 --> 07:00:16.960
I'm at 41.

07:00:16.960 --> 07:00:19.960
This is gonna take forever cutting grass.

07:00:19.960 --> 07:00:21.960
Was it this one?

07:00:21.960 --> 07:00:24.960
If it was, that's incredibly lucky.

07:00:27.960 --> 07:00:30.960
Oh, I'm beating them up.

07:00:34.960 --> 07:00:37.960
If it was this one, then...

07:00:37.960 --> 07:00:39.960
How much do I need?

07:00:39.960 --> 07:00:40.960
Shell.

07:00:40.960 --> 07:00:43.960
Oh, I need quite a few more to be honest.

07:00:43.960 --> 07:00:46.960
Oh wow, I just cut that arrow in the air.

07:00:51.960 --> 07:00:55.960
I wonder how much time on my life I spent cutting grass and Zelda.

07:00:56.960 --> 07:00:58.960
Link gets the job cutting grass.

07:00:58.960 --> 07:01:01.960
Okay, that'll help out quite a bit.

07:01:01.960 --> 07:01:04.960
That was, we've got 230 rupees now,

07:01:04.960 --> 07:01:10.960
which means we can buy 30 more so we can get the second last ketchup.

07:01:10.960 --> 07:01:14.960
Or we could just keep farming to be honest.

07:01:14.960 --> 07:01:17.960
I don't know, I think we're gonna have to farm for this.

07:01:17.960 --> 07:01:19.960
Is that a special?

07:01:19.960 --> 07:01:20.960
Has it got fairy in it?

07:01:20.960 --> 07:01:22.960
Yep, it was special.

07:01:22.960 --> 07:01:23.960
See?

07:01:25.960 --> 07:01:26.960
Ow.

07:01:33.960 --> 07:01:34.960
Did I do this right?

07:01:34.960 --> 07:01:37.960
That other one gave me six coins in one go.

07:01:41.960 --> 07:01:42.960
Drapped.

07:01:44.960 --> 07:01:47.960
Remember catching chickens give shells on money?

07:01:47.960 --> 07:01:49.960
Oh no!

07:01:50.960 --> 07:01:52.960
My biggest enemy.

07:01:53.960 --> 07:01:55.960
Like, for real, for real though.

07:01:55.960 --> 07:01:57.960
Is there something here I've yet to do?

07:01:57.960 --> 07:01:58.960
Or did I already do that?

07:01:58.960 --> 07:02:00.960
I already did it.

07:02:06.960 --> 07:02:09.960
Did you check the orange people flowers?

07:02:09.960 --> 07:02:10.960
Where?

07:02:10.960 --> 07:02:14.960
I checked up on the guy, but he never did me anything.

07:02:19.960 --> 07:02:21.960
I'll see how hard these chickens are.

07:02:21.960 --> 07:02:24.960
Maybe, maybe I can't believe I'm saying this,

07:02:24.960 --> 07:02:27.960
but maybe it's worthwhile to go run around and look after chickens.

07:02:27.960 --> 07:02:28.960
What's that, 90?

07:02:28.960 --> 07:02:30.960
I think that's about 400%.

07:02:35.960 --> 07:02:38.960
Second last figure, we can do it.

07:02:38.960 --> 07:02:39.960
Second last.

07:02:40.960 --> 07:02:42.960
What's it gonna be?

07:02:42.960 --> 07:02:43.960
Oh, you're back.

07:02:43.960 --> 07:02:44.960
I am back.

07:02:44.960 --> 07:02:46.960
And I'm addicted.

07:02:47.960 --> 07:02:49.960
Probability is one.

07:02:51.960 --> 07:02:52.960
One.

07:02:55.960 --> 07:02:58.960
Wait, so am I gonna have a move for 100% guarantee?

07:03:03.960 --> 07:03:05.960
I don't have enough to put 100 shells in.

07:03:05.960 --> 07:03:08.960
I am not risking it, sauce, but...

07:03:08.960 --> 07:03:11.960
Oh my god, I can't even get rid of it!

07:03:11.960 --> 07:03:14.960
No, I'm sorry, I am not risking all those shells

07:03:14.960 --> 07:03:17.960
just to get it, just to not get it.

07:03:17.960 --> 07:03:18.960
Roll them bones, no.

07:03:18.960 --> 07:03:21.960
You guys have no idea how unlucky I am.

07:03:21.960 --> 07:03:24.960
Did you not watch the Buckshot Relay Stream?

07:03:24.960 --> 07:03:28.960
Where I lost on the tutorial twice or something?

07:03:28.960 --> 07:03:30.960
So we can clip it if it goes wrong.

07:03:30.960 --> 07:03:33.960
No, I am not that brave.

07:03:33.960 --> 07:03:35.960
I literally, I lost.

07:03:35.960 --> 07:03:37.960
We never lose.

07:03:37.960 --> 07:03:39.960
All gambas quit.

07:03:39.960 --> 07:03:41.960
Right, I can't believe I'm saying this,

07:03:41.960 --> 07:03:43.960
but we're gonna give the chicken a try.

07:03:45.960 --> 07:03:48.960
See if that'll give us the money we're looking for.

07:03:48.960 --> 07:03:49.960
Hi.

07:03:50.960 --> 07:03:52.960
Sure, what do you want?

07:03:53.960 --> 07:03:57.960
These are the ones that are halfway across the map.

07:03:58.960 --> 07:04:01.960
No, I'm not playing in your stupid chicken game.

07:04:01.960 --> 07:04:03.960
Fuck you, I'm going to the swamp, where is it?

07:04:03.960 --> 07:04:04.960
Down.

07:04:04.960 --> 07:04:06.960
No, oh, no, down.

07:04:06.960 --> 07:04:10.960
No, I am not, I'm not playing in your chicken games

07:04:10.960 --> 07:04:12.960
where they're halfway across the map.

07:04:13.960 --> 07:04:16.960
I'm going to the swamp and there's nothing you can do about it.

07:04:16.960 --> 07:04:19.960
Swamp to kill this little golden goose thing.

07:04:22.960 --> 07:04:25.960
Where was it? Was it down here?

07:04:26.960 --> 07:04:28.960
What is that?

07:04:30.960 --> 07:04:33.960
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

07:04:33.960 --> 07:04:36.960
I'm actually really bad at that, I don't know.

07:04:38.960 --> 07:04:40.960
Can I go down that pool?

07:04:41.960 --> 07:04:43.960
What do you want to do?

07:04:44.960 --> 07:04:45.960
Ow.

07:04:49.960 --> 07:04:51.960
Oh, well, yeah, you're right, I could have gone to that one,

07:04:51.960 --> 07:04:53.960
that would have been a lot quicker.

07:04:53.960 --> 07:04:55.960
But we're here, we're here, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

07:04:55.960 --> 07:04:58.960
Look, it's about the journey, it's about the experience

07:04:58.960 --> 07:05:01.960
we made along the way, the experience we made losing our health.

07:05:01.960 --> 07:05:03.960
Row, wake up.

07:05:05.960 --> 07:05:06.960
Wake up.

07:05:07.960 --> 07:05:08.960
Wake up.

07:05:12.960 --> 07:05:15.960
Prepping slow cooked stew while watching strongly.

07:05:15.960 --> 07:05:16.960
Good girl, man.

07:05:16.960 --> 07:05:18.960
Oh, that's what you did.

07:05:18.960 --> 07:05:20.960
Oh wait, did I go in here?

07:05:20.960 --> 07:05:23.960
Is this new or am I just making it up?

07:05:23.960 --> 07:05:25.960
Have I been in you before?

07:05:25.960 --> 07:05:27.960
I have, because I've already...

07:05:27.960 --> 07:05:31.960
I can trade, I can trade, please take it, take my stone.

07:05:32.960 --> 07:05:36.960
It's been so long, four minutes.

07:05:36.960 --> 07:05:39.960
You're beanstalk as well.

07:05:39.960 --> 07:05:41.960
We're in the money, boys, we're in the money.

07:05:41.960 --> 07:05:46.960
Beanstalk as well as Golden's thingy, my Bobber.

07:05:49.960 --> 07:05:51.960
Oh, and I'm like two centimeters away from it.

07:05:51.960 --> 07:05:53.960
Oh my god, you're such a good boy, little Minish thing.

07:05:53.960 --> 07:05:55.960
Hold on, have you got another trade for me?

07:05:56.960 --> 07:05:58.960
You don't, but that's fine, we're gonna go to the Minish mines.

07:05:58.960 --> 07:06:00.960
I keep forgetting to go to the Minish mines.

07:06:01.960 --> 07:06:03.960
Oh my god, we're doing it.

07:06:03.960 --> 07:06:04.960
We're doing it, I can do it.

07:06:04.960 --> 07:06:06.960
Shawnee's just gonna try and fill two more,

07:06:06.960 --> 07:06:07.960
so we're perfect, right?

07:06:07.960 --> 07:06:09.960
I've not even killed the main boss yet.

07:06:09.960 --> 07:06:11.960
I've not even done the boss fight.

07:06:11.960 --> 07:06:13.960
I'm too busy like getting distracted,

07:06:13.960 --> 07:06:15.960
like doing all these wee side things.

07:06:15.960 --> 07:06:17.960
I was gonna try and a hundred percent it,

07:06:17.960 --> 07:06:19.960
but I have no idea what I'm missing,

07:06:19.960 --> 07:06:21.960
like I'm not smart enough.

07:06:22.960 --> 07:06:24.960
Clean, clean, clean, clean.

07:06:24.960 --> 07:06:26.960
I'm climbing, I'm climbing.

07:06:26.960 --> 07:06:28.960
Oh!

07:06:29.960 --> 07:06:31.960
You got large quiver!

07:06:31.960 --> 07:06:34.960
So we can hold 90, oh, 90 bombs, 90 now.

07:06:34.960 --> 07:06:36.960
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll take it, I'll take it.

07:06:37.960 --> 07:06:39.960
Did that thing get away down again?

07:06:39.960 --> 07:06:40.960
That's fine.

07:06:42.960 --> 07:06:44.960
Copium telecom is doing.

07:06:45.960 --> 07:06:47.960
Right, let's go get that sneak,

07:06:47.960 --> 07:06:50.960
and then we can finally a hundred percent our gacha pawn.

07:06:51.960 --> 07:06:53.960
I like how the sneak just let me beat them up earlier,

07:06:53.960 --> 07:06:55.960
and now that's fine.

07:06:58.960 --> 07:07:00.960
Right, I actually...

07:07:01.960 --> 07:07:03.960
Oh wait, there's a freaking short cut right here

07:07:03.960 --> 07:07:05.960
that I walked right past.

07:07:05.960 --> 07:07:07.960
Cutting the grass.

07:07:07.960 --> 07:07:08.960
Cut the grass.

07:07:08.960 --> 07:07:10.960
Can't wait to play grass cut or similiar.

07:07:12.960 --> 07:07:15.960
I'm actually surprised the power washer doves

07:07:15.960 --> 07:07:17.960
aren't coming out with some stuff.

07:07:17.960 --> 07:07:19.960
I'm pretty sure you can't activate them

07:07:19.960 --> 07:07:21.960
or hurt them from behind.

07:07:23.960 --> 07:07:25.960
We need to not upset them.

07:07:25.960 --> 07:07:28.960
I mean, did you get oiled up for the clap audio?

07:07:30.960 --> 07:07:33.960
Yeah, you can hear me put it on, actually.

07:07:33.960 --> 07:07:36.960
You can hear me take off the apparel

07:07:36.960 --> 07:07:38.960
and put on the...

07:07:40.960 --> 07:07:42.960
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

07:07:42.960 --> 07:07:44.960
And...

07:07:44.960 --> 07:07:46.960
Put on...

07:07:48.960 --> 07:07:51.960
I've taken a while to make the power wash on that.

07:07:55.960 --> 07:07:57.960
It's a battle of the laser beam!

07:08:00.960 --> 07:08:02.960
Oh, I love the laser beam.

07:08:03.960 --> 07:08:05.960
Did I unlock something else here?

07:08:05.960 --> 07:08:07.960
I have a feeling I unlocked something else here.

07:08:08.960 --> 07:08:10.960
I didn't.

07:08:12.960 --> 07:08:14.960
Okay, I love this laser beam.

07:08:14.960 --> 07:08:16.960
Stay with me all the time.

07:08:17.960 --> 07:08:18.960
That's what I want to see.

07:08:18.960 --> 07:08:19.960
That's what I want to see.

07:08:19.960 --> 07:08:21.960
Right, how much money?

07:08:21.960 --> 07:08:23.960
Oh, I'm only 150.

07:08:26.960 --> 07:08:28.960
Is that supposed to do something else?

07:08:28.960 --> 07:08:29.960
Where does it come from?

07:08:29.960 --> 07:08:31.960
Maybe...

07:08:32.960 --> 07:08:34.960
Maybe...

07:08:34.960 --> 07:08:36.960
something?

07:08:37.960 --> 07:08:40.960
Should I be giving chat a large cover right now?

07:08:40.960 --> 07:08:42.960
That was so good.

07:08:42.960 --> 07:08:44.960
Well, it's getting uploaded first, right then.

07:08:45.960 --> 07:08:48.960
I think I'll tame it to come on...

07:08:48.960 --> 07:08:50.960
to go live, like, an hour before AC,

07:08:50.960 --> 07:08:52.960
because I don't want it to, like...

07:08:52.960 --> 07:08:54.960
It's not going to disrupt AC's stream,

07:08:54.960 --> 07:08:55.960
but...

07:08:55.960 --> 07:08:57.960
I mean, you didn't even want to...

07:08:57.960 --> 07:08:59.960
I don't want to, like...

07:09:00.960 --> 07:09:02.960
Obviously...

07:09:02.960 --> 07:09:04.960
Yeah, I'm trying to pick more words.

07:09:04.960 --> 07:09:05.960
I don't want to be, like...

07:09:05.960 --> 07:09:07.960
I don't want to steamroll over my gen mates.

07:09:07.960 --> 07:09:09.960
Also me, who streams for 12 hours,

07:09:09.960 --> 07:09:11.960
so it's kind of unavoidable.

07:09:15.960 --> 07:09:18.960
The last few heart pieces are actually in the dungeon.

07:09:18.960 --> 07:09:19.960
Oh, okay.

07:09:19.960 --> 07:09:20.960
Yeah, that was fine.

07:09:25.960 --> 07:09:28.960
Was that supposed to do something with the orange guy,

07:09:28.960 --> 07:09:30.960
or am I being trolled?

07:09:35.960 --> 07:09:40.960
I think I'll just have to go farming in that field.

07:09:40.960 --> 07:09:42.960
The orange flower guy?

07:09:42.960 --> 07:09:44.960
Someone mentioned it again, and I'm like,

07:09:44.960 --> 07:09:46.960
are you trolling me, or is there actually

07:09:46.960 --> 07:09:48.960
something with that orange flower guy?

07:09:50.960 --> 07:09:52.960
Did you say he was in town or not?

07:09:52.960 --> 07:09:53.960
I don't...

07:10:01.960 --> 07:10:03.960
Someone said...

07:10:03.960 --> 07:10:05.960
Is it Beel?

07:10:08.960 --> 07:10:09.960
Him?

07:10:09.960 --> 07:10:11.960
Why hello there, thanks for coming by.

07:10:11.960 --> 07:10:13.960
I start playing the theme.

07:10:14.960 --> 07:10:16.960
No, I think I'm mistaken.

07:10:16.960 --> 07:10:17.960
Right, this is the Gambo, man.

07:10:17.960 --> 07:10:19.960
I'm not sure I want a Gambo, to be honest.

07:10:20.960 --> 07:10:22.960
Beel sells...

07:10:22.960 --> 07:10:24.960
Who's Beeto?

07:10:24.960 --> 07:10:26.960
That guy, the guy I just spoke to.

07:10:30.960 --> 07:10:32.960
The veggie man?

07:10:36.960 --> 07:10:38.960
Click on the jar.

07:10:43.960 --> 07:10:45.960
Why hello there, that is the weight

07:10:45.960 --> 07:10:47.960
for people who want to get lucky.

07:10:48.960 --> 07:10:50.960
Oh...

07:10:50.960 --> 07:10:52.960
Okay, that's actually...

07:10:52.960 --> 07:10:54.960
No, I did not have the money for that,

07:10:54.960 --> 07:10:56.960
but thank you anyway for asking.

07:10:59.960 --> 07:11:01.960
Okay, have you played Brit...

07:11:01.960 --> 07:11:03.960
No, this is my only legend Zolda game.

07:11:03.960 --> 07:11:05.960
I have not had any Zolda experience

07:11:05.960 --> 07:11:07.960
other than this game.

07:11:08.960 --> 07:11:10.960
Right, give me the money for cutting the grass

07:11:10.960 --> 07:11:11.960
right now.

07:11:11.960 --> 07:11:13.960
Hand over the money and no one gets hurt.

07:11:13.960 --> 07:11:15.960
Did I make myself clear video game?

07:11:17.960 --> 07:11:19.960
Check out all his other ones too.

07:11:21.960 --> 07:11:23.960
Wind Walker.

07:11:23.960 --> 07:11:25.960
Wah, he wants to trade.

07:11:25.960 --> 07:11:27.960
I saw that, I saw that, he wants to trade.

07:11:27.960 --> 07:11:29.960
I knew you would want to do it.

07:11:29.960 --> 07:11:31.960
I knew it, I knew it.

07:11:31.960 --> 07:11:33.960
I knew it, what do you want?

07:11:33.960 --> 07:11:35.960
Please be a treasure chest, so I can get money

07:11:35.960 --> 07:11:37.960
for easy peasy land and squeezing.

07:11:37.960 --> 07:11:39.960
There's one for shells, is there?

07:11:39.960 --> 07:11:41.960
I don't know where that is.

07:11:41.960 --> 07:11:43.960
That's super easy to get to.

07:11:43.960 --> 07:11:45.960
Right, we're heading straight for it.

07:11:45.960 --> 07:11:47.960
We're making a b-link for it.

07:11:47.960 --> 07:11:49.960
A perfect match.

07:11:49.960 --> 07:11:51.960
Thank you, Grandad.

07:11:51.960 --> 07:11:53.960
I appreciate it. Do you want to do it again?

07:11:53.960 --> 07:11:55.960
Maybe?

07:11:55.960 --> 07:11:57.960
No, sorry.

07:11:57.960 --> 07:11:59.960
Sorry for even asking.

07:12:07.960 --> 07:12:09.960
Have my money, don't hurt me.

07:12:11.960 --> 07:12:13.960
Why are you giving me money though?

07:12:13.960 --> 07:12:15.960
Wait, where the heck am I doing?

07:12:15.960 --> 07:12:17.960
A little to the left?

07:12:19.960 --> 07:12:21.960
Thank you again

07:12:21.960 --> 07:12:23.960
for the tips.

07:12:25.960 --> 07:12:27.960
Why are you giving me pieces

07:12:27.960 --> 07:12:29.960
that I can't even do anything with?

07:12:29.960 --> 07:12:31.960
I can't even do anything with them.

07:12:37.960 --> 07:12:39.960
The bad guys always drop coins.

07:12:39.960 --> 07:12:41.960
I feel like the baddies actually drop a decent amount of coins.

07:12:41.960 --> 07:12:43.960
I'm just making that up.

07:12:43.960 --> 07:12:45.960
I can't remember what this was.

07:12:45.960 --> 07:12:47.960
Thank you again, Broly Legends.

07:12:47.960 --> 07:12:49.960
As I struggle to say your name.

07:12:49.960 --> 07:12:51.960
I've already...

07:12:51.960 --> 07:12:53.960
And you don't trade

07:12:53.960 --> 07:12:55.960
because that would be too easy.

07:12:55.960 --> 07:12:57.960
Don't forget to pay your taxes.

07:12:57.960 --> 07:12:59.960
No smile.

07:12:59.960 --> 07:13:01.960
Just kidding!

07:13:01.960 --> 07:13:03.960
I pay my taxes.

07:13:03.960 --> 07:13:05.960
Thank you, Australian Government, for letting me set up businesses in your country.

07:13:05.960 --> 07:13:07.960
I should have better tax rates

07:13:07.960 --> 07:13:09.960
than in the UK.

07:13:09.960 --> 07:13:11.960
I should have gone to Australia.

07:13:11.960 --> 07:13:13.960
Let me set up a business.

07:13:13.960 --> 07:13:15.960
Set one up in Australia.

07:13:23.960 --> 07:13:25.960
This isn't helping either.

07:13:25.960 --> 07:13:27.960
I'm not making any profit doing that.

07:13:29.960 --> 07:13:31.960
I think we're just going to have to go grass farming.

07:13:31.960 --> 07:13:33.960
You know that.

07:13:39.960 --> 07:13:41.960
I'm trying to make the money

07:13:41.960 --> 07:13:43.960
and the shales

07:13:43.960 --> 07:13:45.960
like that.

07:13:45.960 --> 07:13:47.960
Like in the grass patch.

07:13:47.960 --> 07:13:49.960
Because I can do a lot of it in one go.

07:13:51.960 --> 07:13:53.960
I'm sorry.

07:13:53.960 --> 07:13:55.960
She says that she gets absolutely annihilated.

07:13:55.960 --> 07:13:57.960
Do these guys drop money?

07:13:57.960 --> 07:13:59.960
No.

07:13:59.960 --> 07:14:01.960
I'm sorry.

07:14:07.960 --> 07:14:09.960
You're just going to have to wait for me.

07:14:09.960 --> 07:14:11.960
Be patient.

07:14:11.960 --> 07:14:13.960
Please.

07:14:13.960 --> 07:14:15.960
Get annihilated.

07:14:15.960 --> 07:14:17.960
Is the grass patch a buffer below me?

07:14:17.960 --> 07:14:19.960
Look at the ball.

07:14:19.960 --> 07:14:21.960
Maybe.

07:14:21.960 --> 07:14:23.960
Oh, maybe Parasy wants to trade.

07:14:23.960 --> 07:14:25.960
Parasy might want to trade.

07:14:25.960 --> 07:14:27.960
At least use the spin attack on the grass.

07:14:27.960 --> 07:14:29.960
You are so correct.

07:14:29.960 --> 07:14:31.960
Holy crap.

07:14:31.960 --> 07:14:33.960
Parasy doesn't care.

07:14:33.960 --> 07:14:35.960
Sorry, I just picked up you're saying that you just replaced.

07:14:35.960 --> 07:14:37.960
Spin attack on grass.

07:14:37.960 --> 07:14:39.960
Spin attack on grass.

07:14:39.960 --> 07:14:41.960
Spin on the grass.

07:14:41.960 --> 07:14:43.960
Spin on the grass.

07:14:43.960 --> 07:14:45.960
Spin on the grass.

07:14:45.960 --> 07:14:47.960
Spinning on grass.

07:14:47.960 --> 07:14:49.960
Spinning on grass.

07:14:49.960 --> 07:14:51.960
I don't know.

07:14:53.960 --> 07:14:55.960
Oh my god.

07:14:55.960 --> 07:14:57.960
I completely forgot I could even do this.

07:14:57.960 --> 07:14:59.960
Holy crap.

07:14:59.960 --> 07:15:01.960
Are you serious right now?

07:15:01.960 --> 07:15:03.960
Completely forgot I could even do that.

07:15:03.960 --> 07:15:05.960
This is going to be a lot faster than

07:15:05.960 --> 07:15:07.960
what was originally going on.

07:15:09.960 --> 07:15:11.960
Okay.

07:15:11.960 --> 07:15:13.960
That's right. Drop me nothing game.

07:15:13.960 --> 07:15:15.960
Drop me nothing. It's fine.

07:15:15.960 --> 07:15:17.960
It's not like I wanted anything.

07:15:17.960 --> 07:15:19.960
Okay.

07:15:19.960 --> 07:15:21.960
We're getting shells.

07:15:21.960 --> 07:15:23.960
Hold on a minute.

07:15:23.960 --> 07:15:25.960

Reflings suck that man off that suggested to do the spin attack

07:16:23.060 --> 07:16:27.920
Kidding, that's actually not for me. It's more of an anything I think

It's more of an anything. Yeah, we respect it. We respect it

07:16:39.380 --> 07:16:41.380

But it would have to be recorded video because I can't make it like a fun live stream

07:18:39.140 --> 07:18:43.940
And like I know doki bird. I think she wanted to stream your pet, but then

07:18:50.540 --> 07:18:54.100

07:19:59.780 --> 07:20:02.080
Okay, we've got to that run got to that run

07:20:06.340 --> 07:20:09.460
Like please I haven't seen my family in 30 years. Oh

07:20:11.100 --> 07:20:14.340

And I've been like absolutely scrounging around for any of them for like how long the entire game and

07:20:21.300 --> 07:20:23.300
We're sitting in this

07:20:24.180 --> 07:20:25.340
Right

07:20:25.340 --> 07:20:31.500
Sorry, how many times have we not had one spawn? I do this like a handful of times and we've got like 10

07:20:31.940 --> 07:20:33.740

07:20:33.740 --> 07:20:35.740
Know your game living to Zelda

07:20:37.300 --> 07:20:39.580
Your drop rates are doo-doo

07:20:41.620 --> 07:20:43.620
I'm so sorry for the change of music

07:20:46.180 --> 07:20:51.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and another one drops of course it's on another one while we're okay

07:20:52.860 --> 07:20:54.980
Absolutely getting trolled right now about this game

07:20:56.420 --> 07:21:00.780
Ever since like one pair links new landscaping business

07:21:14.180 --> 07:21:19.460
170 and then we can go by the other theory that are missing and we're done

07:21:21.020 --> 07:21:27.740
We're done. We have we have completed the catch up and we can finally get into that freaking shot honestly. Oh

07:21:27.860 --> 07:21:29.860
Oh

07:21:32.700 --> 07:21:37.020
That was a good one that was a good one if you saw that I think that was for that batch

07:21:41.140 --> 07:21:46.100
You're gonna dream about the grass cutting sound effect on his way we're almost there

07:21:47.100 --> 07:21:49.100

07:22:32.340 --> 07:22:39.160
I'll pick up one literally one more. Oh, no, I won't the game knows exactly what I want to do right now

07:22:40.820 --> 07:22:46.580
I just want one more for like reassurance in case the game is gonna ask for more than one right

07:22:47.780 --> 07:22:51.380
Get me to that gamble shop right now

07:22:52.100 --> 07:22:58.120

There was a kinsome. Oh, I got a red piece for that wall

07:27:37.140 --> 07:27:38.980

Ah, whatever in game test and lock behind worse side first

07:27:54.820 --> 07:27:58.100
Well, I think that's all I can do. I think we're gonna go for it

07:27:59.300 --> 07:28:04.580
Um, unfortunately, I don't know what I've missed. Do you guys say there's a few more ahead?

07:28:06.100 --> 07:28:08.660
Oh, they're being guarded. I forgot. Pardon me

07:28:10.740 --> 07:28:13.240
Okay reeflings it's time

07:28:17.460 --> 07:28:19.780
I don't know how sensitive the ai is in this game

07:28:24.340 --> 07:28:26.340
It doesn't seem too bad

07:28:26.580 --> 07:28:29.460
Uh famous last words. I bet you it does seem too bad

07:28:31.060 --> 07:28:33.060
I bet you a pie

07:28:35.220 --> 07:28:38.500
Okay, okay. I'm not too bad. Not too bad. Let me get up. Let me get up

07:28:40.580 --> 07:28:43.460
Don't want to be caught. Don't want to be caught right hide under here

07:28:44.420 --> 07:28:51.460
Can't see us can't see us. Take it easy. Oh, I'm supposed to go for it there. It's

07:28:53.140 --> 07:28:55.140
When he turns back

07:28:55.780 --> 07:28:56.900
piss

07:28:56.900 --> 07:28:58.900
How did you see me?

07:28:59.700 --> 07:29:01.940
I'm okay. They're a little bit more sensitive than I thought

07:29:03.380 --> 07:29:08.100
Look, it's not bad being sensitive, but she's giving me a chance, you know

07:29:08.820 --> 07:29:10.820
I

07:29:12.420 --> 07:29:14.420
Head behind this bush

07:29:19.220 --> 07:29:21.220
There we go

07:29:21.220 --> 07:29:23.220
Look at a split

07:29:24.420 --> 07:29:26.420
And hide behind here

07:29:27.300 --> 07:29:29.300
How did he see me?

07:29:31.940 --> 07:29:37.700
Am I doing the taming wrong is there maybe maybe there's a taming on the bottom two down there that I don't know about

07:29:38.340 --> 07:29:40.340
I'm struggling

07:29:40.980 --> 07:29:42.980
I'm needing uh an

07:29:43.300 --> 07:29:47.860
Invisible cloak that would probably go quite that would go down quite well. I'm not gonna lie

07:29:49.780 --> 07:29:52.660
I think you have fusing left, but it's hunting down the people. Yes

07:29:52.820 --> 07:29:56.900
It's definitely fusing because there's so many things that are blocked off and I'm like bro. I don't even

07:29:58.180 --> 07:30:00.180
Sneak past them into that

07:30:00.420 --> 07:30:02.420
He turns

07:30:03.140 --> 07:30:07.540
No, okay, there's definitely some sort of tile distance. I cannot cross

07:30:09.060 --> 07:30:11.060
Hey, I never even came in

07:30:11.860 --> 07:30:14.740
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. I never even came in

07:30:16.020 --> 07:30:18.740
Okay, definitely a tail distance. Keep that in mind

07:30:22.660 --> 07:30:27.220
Tail distance any tail distance a analyzers

07:30:28.820 --> 07:30:32.340
Analyze analyze analyze safe

07:30:33.860 --> 07:30:37.860

07:30:39.060 --> 07:30:41.060
Analyze

07:30:43.780 --> 07:30:46.820
It must be on the next input when he turns around go for it

07:30:50.420 --> 07:30:52.420
Wow

07:30:54.260 --> 07:30:56.260
Come on

07:30:56.580 --> 07:31:00.820
Bro, we actually just want to like progress with the main quest. Can you just like let us in?

07:31:02.420 --> 07:31:03.940
Can you just let us in we're

07:31:04.020 --> 07:31:11.060
Genuinely just trying to play the game at this point not even like haha funny stealth like bro. We're just trying to play the game

07:31:14.900 --> 07:31:16.900
Safe

07:31:18.260 --> 07:31:23.540
Right when he goes down I can hide behind here, but then I need them to do another rotation

07:31:25.700 --> 07:31:28.340
Which is fine and he will taste which is fine

07:31:29.860 --> 07:31:31.860
He'll rotate

07:31:31.860 --> 07:31:33.860
I'm out of you

07:31:39.380 --> 07:31:41.380
Wah

07:31:41.380 --> 07:31:42.740
Wah

07:31:42.740 --> 07:31:44.740
Get that sword out right now

07:31:46.660 --> 07:31:51.940
Oops, I hurt myself. It's fine. Oh wait, I don't have a full fairies. Do I I don't know where the other bottle is

07:31:53.220 --> 07:31:55.220
I'll be an infusion need out

07:31:56.260 --> 07:31:58.260
We made it

07:32:02.820 --> 07:32:09.700
Okay, last element to infuse and everything's going to go all dark and not very nice, but that's just the way the games

07:32:14.500 --> 07:32:16.500
And now it's golden

07:32:19.220 --> 07:32:21.220
That looks like a beast of a sword

07:32:24.740 --> 07:32:26.740
Oh, it's pretty

07:32:27.620 --> 07:32:35.060
The power of the wind element has infused your blade with the power of the four elements your blade has become the four sword

07:32:36.100 --> 07:32:42.660
Focus focus power in your blade and release a fire a beam use it to break batty's curse and restore the people

07:32:50.100 --> 07:32:52.100
That's fantastic

07:32:52.820 --> 07:32:54.260
Oh

07:32:54.340 --> 07:32:59.940
Secret door. Hmm. Hmm. It seems that forging the sacred blade somehow opened that doorway

07:33:00.180 --> 07:33:05.060
It must lead to the rooms that holds the secret of the light force link. We have to go inside

07:33:07.140 --> 07:33:09.140
Oh

07:33:09.860 --> 07:33:11.860
Oh

07:33:12.260 --> 07:33:18.660
How interesting look at the images on the stained glass. I bet those pictures show us where the light force is hidden

07:33:20.420 --> 07:33:23.540
In the principessa it's the opening

07:33:25.140 --> 07:33:28.260
A long long time ago

07:33:30.740 --> 07:33:34.100
When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow

07:33:39.940 --> 07:33:45.460
The tiny picori appeared from the sky bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light

07:33:47.540 --> 07:33:51.060
With wisdom and courage the hero drove out the darkness

07:33:55.220 --> 07:34:02.180
When peace has been restored the people enshrined the blade with care

07:34:04.660 --> 07:34:11.460
But here it is and the force of the golden light embodied in Hyrule's princess shone forth upon the land

07:34:15.940 --> 07:34:17.940
So that's what it means

07:34:18.260 --> 07:34:20.260
Oh

07:34:20.500 --> 07:34:26.260
As low you really are too kind first you give me my magic cap and then you guide me here

07:34:26.660 --> 07:34:31.380
You've been far too generous for now. I no longer have any useful. Yeah

07:34:33.060 --> 07:34:35.060
Batty

07:34:35.140 --> 07:34:37.140
Yes, that is brish. I don't know

07:34:40.100 --> 07:34:42.100
What

07:34:42.420 --> 07:34:49.060
At last I finally know the location of the light force it's the princess

07:34:50.820 --> 07:34:52.980
Link wake up. Can you wake up?

07:34:56.020 --> 07:34:59.780
Batty disguised himself as the king to search for the light force

07:35:00.100 --> 07:35:05.780
When he learned of this place he waited for us to reforge the blade if that stained glass is accurate

07:35:06.180 --> 07:35:11.460
Princess Zelda holds the light force batty will do whatever it takes to steal that power from her

07:35:12.100 --> 07:35:17.700
If he succeeds, he may never be able to return the princess to normal

07:35:18.500 --> 07:35:21.620
We've wasted too much time link. We must stop batty

07:35:22.420 --> 07:35:25.860
Oh, yeah piss. Oh, yeah piss. We're on the timer. Are we actually though?

07:35:26.900 --> 07:35:28.900
Or am I being trolled?

07:35:30.740 --> 07:35:35.060
Why it's golden well, it's all different now, isn't it?

07:35:38.020 --> 07:35:40.020
All different now

07:35:42.420 --> 07:35:44.420
Oh

07:35:46.900 --> 07:35:52.580
What what is this what's happened here? They've been turned to stone all of them the minister and the guard

07:35:53.540 --> 07:35:58.180
Everyone in the castles like princess Zelda. This can only be the work of that evil batty

07:35:58.260 --> 07:36:03.060
What cruelty link we must use the power of the sacred foresword to undo this evil

07:36:03.060 --> 07:36:05.060
Oh

07:36:12.100 --> 07:36:14.660
Thank you. Thank you. You're the one who returned me to normal, aren't you?

07:36:14.980 --> 07:36:19.700
I don't know how you did it, but I cannot thank you enough. Listen. Have you seen how strange the king's been lately?

07:36:20.020 --> 07:36:23.540
That's because it's not the king at all. It's batty. He's taken over the castle

07:36:24.100 --> 07:36:28.100
One by one. He's turned us all to stone everyone cursed by his evil magic

07:36:28.500 --> 07:36:31.620
Then the monsters arrived even paralyzed. I saw it all

07:36:32.180 --> 07:36:35.380
I only pray it's not too late to undo this evil

07:36:40.500 --> 07:36:42.500
There's so many

07:36:43.540 --> 07:36:48.500
Link we need your help batty took a petrified princess to the roof of the castello

07:36:48.820 --> 07:36:54.820
He must be planning something fiendish. You must stop him. I'm going. I'm going. Fuck me. I've only got two fairies in a ball

07:36:56.340 --> 07:36:58.340
You're in my way, mate

07:36:58.740 --> 07:37:02.100
Okay, we can get past

07:37:03.540 --> 07:37:06.260
Thanks, mate. Thanks for not putting me in a dialogue as well actually

07:37:06.980 --> 07:37:08.980
dark hyrule castello

07:37:10.340 --> 07:37:11.540
Oh

07:37:11.540 --> 07:37:15.220
Is this really hyrule castle? I can't believe it. What's happened here?

07:37:15.540 --> 07:37:18.180
Patty's magic has grown more powerful than I imagined

07:37:18.660 --> 07:37:21.540
But the king and zelda are in danger link. We need to go

07:37:22.820 --> 07:37:25.380
Oh castle, but evil literally

07:37:26.340 --> 07:37:31.060
Oh, I'm not full health. So I can't oh, I'm definitely not full health after that you don't

07:37:32.660 --> 07:37:34.660
Fucking wait to add it up

07:37:36.900 --> 07:37:38.900
These are fake rooms, yeah

07:37:45.540 --> 07:37:47.540
Surely I won't burn myself

07:37:56.180 --> 07:37:58.180
Oh

07:37:58.180 --> 07:38:00.180
We go because we don't have the key

07:38:05.460 --> 07:38:08.340
Oh the jail cell we'll get the jail

07:38:09.620 --> 07:38:15.620
Can I undo you from here? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry. Sorry king. Oh, I can't eat you

07:38:16.580 --> 07:38:18.580
Hold on. Hold on

07:38:19.060 --> 07:38:23.220
Is this the final dungeon? I think so question mark

07:38:24.180 --> 07:38:29.540
Fairy fairy fairy fairy. I've never been happier. See one of you you

07:38:31.620 --> 07:38:33.620
You yank

07:38:35.860 --> 07:38:38.420
I caught a fairy in a ball

07:38:39.220 --> 07:38:46.020
Right there we go. We're fully healed now. We have three fairies at our disposal. Let's we'll put the name mess up a bit too much

07:38:47.460 --> 07:38:49.780
Um, I don't have a key

07:38:49.780 --> 07:38:55.060
I can't go that way but I can at least come in the back faster

07:39:01.380 --> 07:39:06.980
I very easily could have gone wait, what the fuck am I trying to do? Sorry

07:39:10.180 --> 07:39:12.660
I'm not supposed to be here yet

07:39:13.220 --> 07:39:15.220
Thank you

07:39:16.180 --> 07:39:21.540
Is it the same layout in super mario castle? Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to be there. I assume

07:39:24.820 --> 07:39:31.060
I'm supposed to oh well the game is the game said take what you need right? I even need arrows. No, I don't

07:39:33.220 --> 07:39:36.580
Wait, so I was supposed to what am I missing? I'm missing something

07:39:36.660 --> 07:39:42.820
That was a fake door. This is a fake door. No, it's not okay

07:39:45.060 --> 07:39:48.660
Uh, let's jump see if there's some time

07:39:56.020 --> 07:39:58.020
Can you guys be

07:39:58.660 --> 07:40:00.660
Right and then you next

07:40:00.980 --> 07:40:03.460
And you next and you next nope

07:40:03.860 --> 07:40:10.020
I'd rather stay feel healthy. Okay. That's a fake door. So there's something down here. I apologize

07:40:11.940 --> 07:40:18.180
Am I to fall in the gap? Maybe that's what drops me into the cell. Okay. I think the gap drops me into the cell

07:40:21.460 --> 07:40:26.980
Boss battle imminent and everyone's reset because why would we not reset?

07:40:26.980 --> 07:40:28.980
Yep

07:40:30.420 --> 07:40:36.740
No, this is just here. Okay that okay. I'm missing something. Sorry. Give me a second. I'm missing something

07:40:38.260 --> 07:40:43.060
Now rattle the cages rattle rattle. Okay can't rattle the cages like a feral dog

07:40:43.060 --> 07:40:45.060
Hmm

07:40:55.940 --> 07:40:58.260
I can see I can get small there

07:41:00.020 --> 07:41:02.020
Right now what?

07:41:03.220 --> 07:41:07.860
Open sesame literally wait, can I like batter the door down maybe?

07:41:14.020 --> 07:41:16.020
Oh

07:41:17.700 --> 07:41:20.420
Should have been through the kids it seems to get blocked there

07:41:23.700 --> 07:41:28.420
Yeah, it's getting blocked so I can't do that. I need a key to get to him

07:41:32.180 --> 07:41:34.500
Spoiler alert, this isn't the final dungeon

07:41:36.260 --> 07:41:41.780
If this isn't the final dungeon, I think I'm gonna need to call a food break. I'm already stuck

07:41:41.940 --> 07:41:43.940
And I've not even gotten started

07:41:45.540 --> 07:41:48.900
Is there really nothing back this way? Is it like a bomb?

07:41:50.580 --> 07:41:54.100
Is there a tail that oh, there's a bomb on the wall, bro

07:41:55.940 --> 07:41:57.940
Of course it's a bomb

07:41:59.700 --> 07:42:02.740
I knew something was me right there. I was like, this is me

07:42:05.300 --> 07:42:07.300
This is me working it

07:42:08.180 --> 07:42:10.500
As if you come flying over to me

07:42:12.500 --> 07:42:16.100
Okay, I need to fall down as a medium

07:42:19.540 --> 07:42:21.940
This makes much more sense now

07:42:23.860 --> 07:42:27.860
I was like there must be a wall I'm missing because I can't interact with anything that seems

07:42:30.660 --> 07:42:34.100
Okay, I assume the switch is gonna open up the gates

07:42:35.060 --> 07:42:44.100
Now although that makes no sense, I'm not going to question it at all and instead be thankful

07:42:50.260 --> 07:42:52.180
Hello

07:42:52.180 --> 07:42:55.940
Oh Link, are you the one who broke the curse and returned me to normal?

07:42:55.940 --> 07:42:59.300
You've gone you've gone quite brave since the last time I saw you. I must say

07:42:59.540 --> 07:43:01.540
Oh, but how those kisses

07:43:01.940 --> 07:43:03.860
My love is under vice curse

07:43:03.860 --> 07:43:08.260
Is this all the work of one man as king of hyrule? I must do something about this villain

07:43:08.420 --> 07:43:13.060
But I'm old and I would only hold you back link. You have the sacred blade now

07:43:13.060 --> 07:43:14.340
We must

07:43:14.340 --> 07:43:18.260
You're gonna rely on the 12 year old. Please you must find a way to rescue my Zelda

07:43:18.340 --> 07:43:21.460
Take the key. You can use it to get out of the castle from the basement

07:43:22.020 --> 07:43:25.060
Ah use it to open locked doors. Yes

07:43:27.060 --> 07:43:29.060
I will absolutely take that

07:43:30.260 --> 07:43:34.420
Yeah, I said if you put the switch that opens the cell in the cell that shall I'm like, hmm

07:43:34.420 --> 07:43:37.540
Not sure this would work out in theory. Maybe if it was like one-on-one

07:43:39.540 --> 07:43:41.540
Actually

07:43:43.540 --> 07:43:45.540
Link my boy

07:43:47.060 --> 07:43:53.860
I might have to call a break and get like food in that and maybe try and squeeze out a loaf of bread, you know

07:43:54.420 --> 07:43:58.180
It's not really it's not really happening. I'm not really sure what's going on with the look of bread situation

07:43:59.060 --> 07:44:01.060
Okay, here we go. Here we go

07:44:04.820 --> 07:44:06.820
I don't know how I avoided that but

07:44:12.020 --> 07:44:14.180
I think there was a chest over here

07:44:16.900 --> 07:44:18.900
There is

07:44:21.380 --> 07:44:23.860
Do we even want to see how big this dungeon is

07:44:23.860 --> 07:44:27.860
It's five levels

07:44:38.100 --> 07:44:44.740
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna go with uh, let me get a break. Um, and I'll get some real food on me and

07:44:45.300 --> 07:44:48.660
rehydrate and all that because uh, yeah, this is going to

07:44:48.820 --> 07:44:54.180
Like how much time until mercy we've got less than an hour to try and do all of this

07:44:55.220 --> 07:44:58.020
No an hour and 15 sorry and then mercy comes on

07:45:08.660 --> 07:45:10.660
Wow

07:45:10.660 --> 07:45:14.260
Lower time values sometimes referred to as the sage of dark winds and it is

07:45:15.220 --> 07:45:18.260
Hected in later games as a demonic winged eyeball

07:45:19.140 --> 07:45:22.180
He makes his home in the tower of winds, which is his final dungeon

07:45:23.300 --> 07:45:25.060
Not the temple ones

07:45:25.060 --> 07:45:30.580
Uh, right give me a minute. I'm gonna make a tea. I'm gonna make some lefto berries

07:45:30.660 --> 07:45:33.220
I have no idea why even having the fridge to be honest

07:45:34.340 --> 07:45:38.500
Um, and I'm gonna bake a loaf of bread not in all in that order

07:45:39.540 --> 07:45:42.420
Some of the orders might be different, but I think we can do it

07:45:42.420 --> 07:45:47.700
I think we can finish before mercy if I don't if I don't get absolutely rolled and smoked

07:45:48.980 --> 07:45:52.180
Need to be on my a-game though. Need to be on my a-game

07:45:52.740 --> 07:45:54.340
all right

07:45:54.340 --> 07:45:58.260
Stoney buy some prunes. Actually, I have chocolate raisins

07:45:58.340 --> 07:46:02.980
I've tried to eat them like twice on stream so far and I keep forgetting about them. Are we gonna raid into mercy?

07:46:02.980 --> 07:46:04.980
I'm gonna try to raid into mercy. Yes

07:46:05.940 --> 07:46:07.060
um

07:46:07.060 --> 07:46:09.860
Oh, is that what that slot is for? Hold on

07:46:12.180 --> 07:46:13.060
No

07:46:13.060 --> 07:46:17.300
What the frick are these did anyone type what these are for or is it just like random space?

07:46:17.380 --> 07:46:20.420
Nah, I can't even be random space. It looks like I'm gonna put it everywhere

07:46:22.180 --> 07:46:24.180
Um

07:46:24.980 --> 07:46:28.900
Right we speedrunning well, hopefully we can do it in the mirror

07:46:32.500 --> 07:46:37.860
I'll let you guys analyze the mask okay, so you can tell me where I go when we get to that section

07:46:38.020 --> 07:46:40.180
I'm sure you guys will be able to tell me where I go

07:46:41.460 --> 07:46:44.420
Raisins do have some fiber even though they're covered in chocolate

07:46:44.820 --> 07:46:46.660

Right, I'm uh, I'm gonna be a solid few minutes because you know, I don't know about you

07:46:51.300 --> 07:46:53.860
But when I go to the toilet, you know, you need to bake the look

07:46:54.740 --> 07:46:58.500
Right, I'll be back as quick as I can. Please stretch. Please get some water in here

07:46:58.500 --> 07:47:03.540
Please go toilet time if you need toilet time and please go to sleep if you need to go honk

What the fuck are you giving me

07:53:16.260 --> 07:53:18.260
Oh

07:53:28.260 --> 07:53:30.260
It's actually quite a lot

07:53:34.260 --> 07:53:36.260
I

07:53:38.260 --> 07:53:40.260
Imperial monarch

07:53:40.260 --> 07:53:42.260
Logo Dogo

07:53:42.260 --> 07:53:44.260
Logo Dogo

07:53:48.260 --> 07:53:50.260
I'm

07:53:56.260 --> 07:54:01.260
I know and it's your time. Yeah, I don't know where caca anon is but we're calling upon you. I've had enough

07:54:02.260 --> 07:54:06.260
I've had enough of King Kong's finger knocking at the door then disappearing away again

07:54:06.260 --> 07:54:08.260
I'm getting tired

07:54:10.260 --> 07:54:12.260
Fake door

07:54:12.260 --> 07:54:14.260
Real

07:54:14.260 --> 07:54:16.260
Dark Glasgow castle

07:54:16.260 --> 07:54:18.260
Glasgow DLC unlocked

07:54:20.260 --> 07:54:22.260
No idea what this is supposed to go

07:54:26.260 --> 07:54:28.260
Have I just

07:54:28.260 --> 07:54:30.260
No, definitely not that way

07:54:30.260 --> 07:54:32.260
I

07:54:38.260 --> 07:54:40.260
Can't believe it

07:54:50.260 --> 07:54:58.260
The bread might be a little overcooked by now. Yeah, the bread might be reekin

07:55:00.260 --> 07:55:07.760
Perhaps the sword could reflect the black as low as low mate. I was in the middle of it. Maybe doing that

07:55:14.260 --> 07:55:16.260
Christ

07:55:17.760 --> 07:55:20.260
Something tells me my Scottish rage might come out

07:55:20.260 --> 07:55:22.260
Hmm

07:55:26.260 --> 07:55:28.760
I'm about to order take away to reward myself

07:55:28.760 --> 07:55:35.760
I think this part of the game gets incredibly hard and like no child should be able to actually complete it as I said bye

07:55:37.260 --> 07:55:39.260
I wouldn't work at lunch and strong he's still alive

07:55:42.260 --> 07:55:44.260
We're gonna try and redirect him to me

07:55:45.260 --> 07:55:49.260
Yeah, yeah, can stone pieces

07:55:55.260 --> 07:55:57.260
Yes, order lots of takeaway right hold on

07:56:02.260 --> 07:56:04.260
That cheeky sighting

07:56:07.260 --> 07:56:11.260
What are we feeling feeling a burger I think I'm

07:56:15.260 --> 07:56:17.260
Okay

07:56:19.260 --> 07:56:21.260
My easy-peasy burger I

07:56:22.260 --> 07:56:28.820
Have to admit my diet my diet gets terrible when I'm strumming because I don't have time to cook

07:56:29.660 --> 07:56:32.540
So we do we do a little pickle

07:56:44.260 --> 07:56:49.860
Burger chips what drink cooler spray? I've just made a tea though

07:56:50.700 --> 07:56:53.500
I'm probably probably a spray to wash that

07:57:07.260 --> 07:57:09.260
I don't know

07:57:10.260 --> 07:57:14.820
And I'm not full health, so I can't even do the thing

07:57:15.780 --> 07:57:19.060
Right. Yeah. Oh Dale has been made. We know wait

07:57:20.300 --> 07:57:22.300
She got it

07:57:24.060 --> 07:57:26.560
How do I get away with this? Oh

07:57:29.820 --> 07:57:34.060
Geez they are not making this easy holy shit children are supposed to do this. Oh

07:57:36.020 --> 07:57:38.820
I think the Scottish rage is gonna come out from being honest

07:57:39.380 --> 07:57:41.380
All right

07:57:45.060 --> 07:57:47.060
These indestructible

07:57:54.300 --> 07:58:00.820
You want the rage to come out are you sure you want the rage to come out I don't

07:58:01.820 --> 07:58:03.820
I

07:58:05.660 --> 07:58:09.060
Assume it destroys my little shadows as well

07:58:13.780 --> 07:58:16.460
I was supposed to just send it okay juice have this

07:58:17.140 --> 07:58:19.140
Rookie that's the good news

07:58:19.700 --> 07:58:25.380
Let's put the cape back on because we can probably negate a bit of damage just using the cape and getting away

07:58:26.220 --> 07:58:31.140
Oh, there was that locked door back on the stairwell to the right

07:58:33.620 --> 07:58:35.980
And it was an actual door it wasn't a tribute

07:58:39.660 --> 07:58:44.100
Right that's to jump down which I don't want to do shadow was your money

07:58:44.100 --> 07:58:46.100
Oh

07:58:53.460 --> 07:58:55.460
Surprise

07:59:14.100 --> 07:59:20.260
It's not a spin attack or maybe it's the spin twirl attack hold on. I'll be the spin twirl. Oh

07:59:22.740 --> 07:59:24.740
Okay

07:59:25.220 --> 07:59:27.220
What

07:59:28.380 --> 07:59:32.940
I use the spin attack it has to be it can't be the other one

07:59:36.900 --> 07:59:42.820
No, it's moving me about though sugar what it has to be the spin attack

07:59:44.100 --> 07:59:46.100
Is it just like a position?

07:59:57.580 --> 08:00:05.140
Help hold hand, please any handholders. Oh, sorry. Sorry. That was me that time

08:00:05.140 --> 08:00:07.140

Has to be this right let them shoot how

08:00:12.700 --> 08:00:14.700
And then in position

08:00:16.380 --> 08:00:18.980
I knew it. I knew it was a spin attack has to be

08:00:18.980 --> 08:00:20.980
I

08:00:31.860 --> 08:00:34.740
Am just spamming so I don't take HB damage

08:00:38.340 --> 08:00:40.340
You're done. Oh, I miss

08:00:42.580 --> 08:00:48.140
Like thank goodness we don't need money anymore, so I'm saying I'd be raging

08:00:49.620 --> 08:00:54.340
Wait, there's no key

08:01:02.460 --> 08:01:04.460
I was just for money

08:01:09.100 --> 08:01:11.100
Oh, no, we're back at the star

08:01:17.060 --> 08:01:18.860
Oops

08:01:19.940 --> 08:01:21.940
I'll take that fairy though

08:01:25.140 --> 08:01:27.140
Oops

08:01:27.140 --> 08:01:29.140
Oh

08:01:43.620 --> 08:01:50.920
Everything's good on the hood. Oh, sorry. I'll swap them back. I'm gonna get very confused very fast

08:01:57.500 --> 08:02:04.700
I've gone the wrong way and I'm I'm all turned around now. Sorry, let me jump past you guys

08:02:08.420 --> 08:02:10.420
There wasn't anything back there

08:02:12.340 --> 08:02:17.900
Or is it a hidden bomb spot probably it's always you know what it's always a hidden bomb spot was this

08:02:20.820 --> 08:02:23.220
What are the guards nice to me all of a sudden

08:02:24.380 --> 08:02:26.380
Ring the guards

08:02:26.780 --> 08:02:32.300
Wasn't there not a teacher guy down here. Did he teach me something? Nope. There was definitely not a teacher guy

08:02:35.700 --> 08:02:38.300
Hold on a minute enemy spotted

08:02:41.820 --> 08:02:49.860
Hold on a bean basil and booze and momentum do my little elf eyes deceive me

08:02:51.140 --> 08:02:55.580
No, they do not well, I don't actually need that but thanks

08:02:57.140 --> 08:03:03.460
I don't need it anymore, but I do appreciate the sentiment nonetheless, and we already spoke to this person

08:03:06.460 --> 08:03:08.460
Visitor her rear

08:03:19.420 --> 08:03:21.420

08:03:29.780 --> 08:03:31.700

08:03:43.220 --> 08:03:45.220

08:03:48.060 --> 08:03:50.060
Yeah, it's like a road to the rest

08:03:50.540 --> 08:03:55.180
Sorry, hold on. I didn't even ask you if you could train me. I just got really interested in the Kinstone

08:03:57.300 --> 08:03:59.300
Okay, I already know

08:04:00.460 --> 08:04:02.460
You just taught me all I need to know

08:04:03.500 --> 08:04:06.980
Right, so I'm actually gonna be a naughty Nellie and leave the castle

Where is it? No

08:04:29.580 --> 08:04:31.580
Hello

08:04:34.420 --> 08:04:36.420
I have to go back to Moo Moo Ranch

08:04:38.380 --> 08:04:42.300
The thing about her right now literally, oh, I didn't even you can get Kinstone from a tree

08:04:43.740 --> 08:04:45.740
Oh

08:05:04.060 --> 08:05:06.060
It's a trainer oh

08:05:07.100 --> 08:05:11.100
It's a dojo boy the spirit in the sorter one. I'm ready to

08:05:11.740 --> 08:05:17.180
The best swordsman I will train with me you'll discover the secret to your head and tower. So would you like to train here? Yes

08:05:18.380 --> 08:05:23.900
Hmm now I'll teach you how to fill your split gauge faster than ever. I take visually

08:05:24.620 --> 08:05:28.780
Training very seriously. I'll have you know spot visualize your body split and even faster

08:05:29.900 --> 08:05:31.900
Spell lifting

08:05:31.980 --> 08:05:33.980
Huh

08:05:33.980 --> 08:05:37.900
Now you will fill your spirit gauge much faster. Oh, okay

08:05:38.860 --> 08:05:42.060
Okay, um, I'm doing it. Oh

08:05:43.180 --> 08:05:45.180
Yeah, that's bass

08:05:45.260 --> 08:05:47.260
I'm a I'm a I'm a take

08:05:47.580 --> 08:05:51.660
Thank you for that. Thank you. I'm a visual learner too strong. So

08:05:57.900 --> 08:05:59.820
That might order coming in fast, so we

08:06:01.100 --> 08:06:03.100
It's already been updated on the status

08:06:04.060 --> 08:06:09.580
Don't mind me. I'm gonna be in the middle of the boss fight. I'll be like, no, leave out the door mate. Leave out the door. Hold on

08:06:13.420 --> 08:06:15.420
Right, let's try to cast in

08:06:17.660 --> 08:06:19.660
I went

08:06:20.460 --> 08:06:22.460
way

08:06:22.860 --> 08:06:24.860
Somewhere to the right I'm to go

08:06:25.980 --> 08:06:32.460
And if I jump down there, yeah, so that's definitely not that way. I'll walk straight into that not gonna lie

08:06:34.060 --> 08:06:36.060
And if I jump down there, I've already been

08:06:42.700 --> 08:06:46.860
And this was a dead end. Is this like a vomit kind of end?

08:06:51.660 --> 08:06:56.700
What so this as if the ball spawned back I'm sure whatever

08:07:03.100 --> 08:07:05.100
Yeah, nice try this time

08:07:08.140 --> 08:07:10.860
Bomb the carpet like Isaac's style

08:07:12.540 --> 08:07:14.540
No bomb here

08:07:15.340 --> 08:07:20.380
Like I've got enough bombs to waste. Okay, let's tell them isn't it? There's gotta be something in that wonder. That's what I thought

08:07:21.340 --> 08:07:23.340
I've gotta go back to work. Have fun at work

08:07:26.140 --> 08:07:28.140
Suck up the carpet

08:07:28.380 --> 08:07:32.860
Maybe something drops in this room and we're just a step too far ahead

08:07:37.020 --> 08:07:39.020
Because I mean

08:07:42.300 --> 08:07:45.500
I mean I can check if there's a oh

08:07:48.940 --> 08:07:53.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I knew it. I knew it couldn't have been finished

08:07:58.460 --> 08:08:02.140
Where are we heading? I'm getting nervous. Oh, it's the

08:08:04.620 --> 08:08:06.620
Out in nowhere

08:08:12.620 --> 08:08:14.620
And I accidentally actually dodged that

08:08:17.580 --> 08:08:19.420
Oh

08:08:19.420 --> 08:08:22.940
The chair just shook move that motherfucker thing. I saw it shake

08:08:23.980 --> 08:08:25.980
Yeah

08:08:26.860 --> 08:08:28.860
That's just an end room

08:08:30.220 --> 08:08:33.740
Compass I will absolutely take a compass. What did it change?

08:08:36.860 --> 08:08:40.220
Where's the compass change tells you where there's a loot and stuff

08:08:41.900 --> 08:08:43.900
Shawnee getting so good. Yeah

08:08:44.540 --> 08:08:46.540
Yeah

08:08:54.700 --> 08:08:59.740
Sorry, I'm just doing distance. I I don't want to lose my ability to do this distance attack

08:09:01.100 --> 08:09:08.140
Because it's like helping me get past areas without taking any damage type thing and obviously if I take damage

08:09:08.140 --> 08:09:10.140
I can longer do this move

08:09:10.620 --> 08:09:13.100
So I'm quite appreciative of it

08:09:13.900 --> 08:09:15.900
So

08:09:16.140 --> 08:09:18.860
Oh he what he could do

08:09:37.500 --> 08:09:39.500
I'm just checking

08:09:40.140 --> 08:09:42.140
The weird corner room

08:09:43.900 --> 08:09:48.940
Okay, just uh, just a wee weird corner room. Sorry a little gamer sense was going off, but it must have been the wind

08:09:50.460 --> 08:09:52.460
That must have just been bad. Yeah

08:09:52.620 --> 08:09:54.620
You funk. Thank you

08:10:08.380 --> 08:10:12.860
I don't know can I like okay that was incredibly silly um

08:10:13.980 --> 08:10:15.980
I

08:10:20.140 --> 08:10:23.260
Does it take me out of the air or does the game just be like, yeah

08:10:25.580 --> 08:10:27.900
I mean didn't take me out of the air

08:10:29.900 --> 08:10:33.580
That's quite a facial expression want me being a goofy giver

08:10:36.860 --> 08:10:40.220
I literally did not trust any wall right now because of that

08:10:44.620 --> 08:10:46.620
It looks beautiful

08:10:52.140 --> 08:10:58.140
All right, what's the dealio? I need to get to the four. Oh, I burnt myself twice. I saw it

08:10:59.500 --> 08:11:02.300
Couldn't see it properly because of the metal grate above

08:11:05.340 --> 08:11:07.340
Let's see how this goes

08:11:07.420 --> 08:11:09.420
I

08:11:10.860 --> 08:11:17.820
Wait, I get put on fire for one of my phantoms. Yeah, sorry not buying that mate

08:11:22.300 --> 08:11:24.300
Are you doing time?

08:11:29.420 --> 08:11:31.420
Please don't make me do this again

08:11:31.420 --> 08:11:33.420
Oh

08:11:36.940 --> 08:11:38.940
There you go, how do you like that? You don't

08:11:41.580 --> 08:11:49.020
If you goober god, this map is intense. Sorry, but holy crap. We're like flying about the place. We've got bombas going on

08:11:51.420 --> 08:11:53.420
Can I like

08:11:54.940 --> 08:11:56.940
No, wow

08:11:57.820 --> 08:11:59.820
They're just go for it

08:12:00.460 --> 08:12:02.460
I can't do anything

08:12:04.540 --> 08:12:09.100
Well, if I can't do anything, there's no point in crying about it. Let's just take the heat take the damage

08:12:09.900 --> 08:12:11.900
I don't know what I'm supposed to do

08:12:13.340 --> 08:12:15.340
Okay, thank you

08:12:22.620 --> 08:12:26.060
I'll make it to this one a little to the ray

08:12:27.020 --> 08:12:30.700
Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We're getting there

08:12:35.100 --> 08:12:37.100
I like that we're one shot

08:12:41.180 --> 08:12:47.900
Okay, this there's just two random enemies here. Oh, there's a bridge. Oh, please

08:12:48.860 --> 08:12:50.860
I

08:12:53.580 --> 08:12:57.500
Intrusting them now there is a building through in here. So I'll go in here

08:12:59.340 --> 08:13:01.340
To the dead end

08:13:05.100 --> 08:13:13.180
Uh, not really sure if I'm to do anything at all actually. I don't think so. I'm supposed to shoot in my arrows

08:13:14.060 --> 08:13:19.500
Oh, no, no, I'm not. Okay. Well, I'm not supposed to do this section at all. Hi

08:13:20.700 --> 08:13:26.220
Thanks, please join in. We are currently on the last dungeon bit on Zell law

08:13:27.100 --> 08:13:33.100
Uh, I'm also getting very nervous because I'm not very good at this section. I don't recall ever

08:13:34.060 --> 08:13:36.060
finding it easy. Um

08:13:37.020 --> 08:13:39.580
So childhood me kind of going out the window right now

08:13:40.540 --> 08:13:42.540
It help wise

08:13:43.580 --> 08:13:45.580
Oh

08:13:47.740 --> 08:13:51.980
Whoa, that's what you get for being too close. Yeah, take that stinker

08:13:53.980 --> 08:13:55.980
Stinky McGee

08:14:01.100 --> 08:14:03.980
Oh, is that what the problem is?

08:14:07.180 --> 08:14:09.180
Oh, well, there's not much of a problem

08:14:09.260 --> 08:14:14.780
You're doing great so far we're getting there. I

08:14:20.700 --> 08:14:22.700
Whoa

08:14:23.980 --> 08:14:25.980
This is that's not hurting them

08:14:31.740 --> 08:14:33.740
There's two of them

08:14:34.140 --> 08:14:36.140
Oh

08:14:37.660 --> 08:14:39.660
This is a bit of a

08:14:42.620 --> 08:14:44.620
Have a hand moment

08:14:47.020 --> 08:14:49.020
Got a cheap shot and

08:14:51.820 --> 08:14:53.820
Throw it again. How dare you

08:14:54.380 --> 08:14:59.420
Out. Okay. Whoa. I think they hit for a whole health. That's not good for at all

08:15:00.380 --> 08:15:05.580
Yeah, if you guys can kind of separate yourselves off so you can get a few wax in that group

08:15:07.340 --> 08:15:09.340
Do it again throw it again

08:15:09.740 --> 08:15:14.300
See when they come in together like that, they don't like that. That's hard to kind of

08:15:15.100 --> 08:15:16.860
can't even reach

08:15:16.860 --> 08:15:18.860
can't even reach

08:15:20.300 --> 08:15:26.620
Can't even reach my cheeks and that other guy is now protecting him because they're now stacked up uh game dips

08:15:26.620 --> 08:15:32.060
If you could patch that out right now. Yeah. No, no, I understand. It's a very old. Wow

08:15:32.140 --> 08:15:35.420
They are actually whacking me for one. I do not like that

08:15:37.020 --> 08:15:39.020
I do not like that at all

08:15:39.340 --> 08:15:41.340
Not one itty bitty bit

08:15:42.220 --> 08:15:47.340
Okay, okay, okay much more. Yeah. Yeah. I deserve 50 for that. I'm not gonna lie

08:15:48.860 --> 08:15:52.620
Do you want to throw it or we're just gonna play ball for the there we go

08:15:53.340 --> 08:15:55.340
Okay

08:15:55.740 --> 08:16:01.900
So what is where does the red take us just for curiosity? It takes us to the start of the castle

08:16:03.100 --> 08:16:06.140
So if we really are up Shisa Creek, then we can

08:16:07.260 --> 08:16:11.660
You can stun them with the boomerang. Okay. I think there was two of them. I was a bit like

08:16:12.860 --> 08:16:16.380
But we do have a check point which is huge

08:16:16.380 --> 08:16:25.020
That's not the right way that's opened by uh, is this a wall moment?

08:16:26.780 --> 08:16:28.780
Yeah, it's not

08:16:29.420 --> 08:16:33.900
We have a check point. That's the main thing. That's the most important thing. Okay that we have a checkpoint

08:16:35.340 --> 08:16:37.820
Because this game's getting scary

08:16:39.660 --> 08:16:44.380
If the enemy through starting to thwack for one, I'm not quite confident

08:16:46.380 --> 08:16:48.380
I

08:16:52.620 --> 08:16:54.620
You just put a bomb on this

08:16:55.740 --> 08:16:58.140
Oh it falls well

08:17:00.140 --> 08:17:02.140
Oh, that's the wrong one. Sorry

08:17:04.780 --> 08:17:06.780
Huh

08:17:10.540 --> 08:17:12.540
So what's the bomb before

08:17:12.940 --> 08:17:14.940
Sorry

08:17:26.700 --> 08:17:33.980
Am I missing something I might to pick up the bomb and throw it at them without taking damage question mark

08:17:36.220 --> 08:17:38.540
Huh oh well close enough. Um

08:17:39.020 --> 08:17:41.020
Um

08:17:41.340 --> 08:17:44.700
Now that we have the red portal we can go back and get heals

08:17:46.060 --> 08:17:48.860
So it's not really a problem

08:17:50.700 --> 08:17:54.460
Can I pick up bombs like chickens? I can't

08:18:02.700 --> 08:18:04.700
Oh

08:18:05.580 --> 08:18:11.500
I want to say let me cook but um, I tried to place a bomb on the thing and it never let me

08:18:14.940 --> 08:18:18.380
Yeah, it just falls down. Can you throw one?

08:18:20.060 --> 08:18:25.900
Can I throw a bomb from above? I think no the bomb's gonna stay up on that top level

08:18:27.980 --> 08:18:31.420
Oh wait, can I drop a bomb and throw it? Oh for fuck's sake

08:18:31.980 --> 08:18:35.180
Wait because they don't explode on impact

08:18:46.060 --> 08:18:48.060
That can't be right

08:18:49.500 --> 08:18:51.500
And I can't place one on the tail

08:18:54.140 --> 08:18:56.940
You've got a tamer I can't tame it. I don't have tamed bombs

08:18:57.900 --> 08:19:02.540
Maybe it's just timing on the platform like I can stand on it and it just

08:19:03.660 --> 08:19:07.020
Like luckily I have 85 but like there's no

08:19:09.180 --> 08:19:15.740
You know what you know what game making a they're making a mockery at me ring the guards ring the guards

08:19:17.020 --> 08:19:19.020
The guards are to be rang

08:19:20.300 --> 08:19:22.300
Making an absolute mockery out of me

08:19:23.180 --> 08:19:25.980
Absolute mockery right give me these fairies right now

08:19:27.740 --> 08:19:30.140
Nope, sorry, okay, I'll take that

08:19:34.540 --> 08:19:38.940
That's beautiful. I'm very happy about that. Now that I know those guys heal

08:19:46.220 --> 08:19:48.220
No, don't face that way then

08:19:48.460 --> 08:19:50.460
Oh

08:19:51.820 --> 08:19:58.620
Three damage bro, I even got three health right good thing. I have a shit ton of bombs though

08:20:02.060 --> 08:20:07.260
Wait the bombs don't always necessarily work. No way. Come on. That stinks

08:20:09.580 --> 08:20:11.740
It's a dark. No, I can't believe it

08:20:11.820 --> 08:20:13.820
I

08:20:14.060 --> 08:20:16.060
Wait, why are you being so difficult?

08:20:17.500 --> 08:20:20.060
Ow, let me just kill you seriously

08:20:21.980 --> 08:20:23.980
Seriously, let me just kill you. There's a problem

08:20:26.780 --> 08:20:29.180
Wait, can I like throw a boomerang at space then?

08:20:31.580 --> 08:20:33.820
No, I can't the boomerang does absolutely nothing

08:20:35.740 --> 08:20:38.300
Is a bow and arrow do anything on the armor? Nope

08:20:38.540 --> 08:20:44.860
Is that the best I can do literally just shield and hope I can get frickin whackin

08:20:46.860 --> 08:20:48.860
I'm scared

08:20:52.300 --> 08:20:54.300
Huh

08:20:54.540 --> 08:20:56.940
Okay, there's champions in the four rooms

08:20:57.980 --> 08:21:01.340
Oh, man, I'm gonna need to heal up for that one

08:21:02.460 --> 08:21:04.460
Oh

08:21:08.300 --> 08:21:10.300
No

08:21:22.460 --> 08:21:29.740
Two in one room, where were those fairies again? Okay, they're literally right here. Thank you. I will definitely be taking the fairies

08:21:31.500 --> 08:21:33.500
Thanks, I appreciate it

08:21:34.460 --> 08:21:36.460
All right

08:21:36.940 --> 08:21:40.220
If I apologize, I do apologize for any rage

08:21:41.820 --> 08:21:43.820
Against two enemies

08:21:48.940 --> 08:21:51.500
Well, I'm cornered right now. I'm gonna be honest. I'm cornered

08:21:57.260 --> 08:22:01.180
Okay, these guys maybe because they swing they leave themselves open a bit more

08:22:01.980 --> 08:22:06.780
No length the other way and now we've just lost our ability to

08:22:08.060 --> 08:22:09.180
Uh

08:22:09.180 --> 08:22:11.180
Fire

08:22:12.300 --> 08:22:15.420
Hams to the best of us link. Oh, sorry. I'll put that on

08:22:19.340 --> 08:22:21.100
Okay

08:22:21.100 --> 08:22:23.100
that went

08:22:23.100 --> 08:22:25.100
Strangely well all things considered

08:22:25.820 --> 08:22:29.180
Uh, I think we're just gonna do the same tactic where we just

08:22:29.660 --> 08:22:34.540
Do that and get the fairies out so I can shoot at least

08:22:36.780 --> 08:22:38.780
Thank you, darling

08:22:39.980 --> 08:22:44.460
I'm getting formed so literally guys. Why aren't you here to carry me? So what happens if I go up?

08:22:50.780 --> 08:22:55.820
I've got like weird quest rooms to do now because they were all hiding behind doors

08:22:56.380 --> 08:22:58.380
I

08:22:58.860 --> 08:23:00.860
Open the door

08:23:04.540 --> 08:23:06.540
What's in here? Oh

08:23:07.900 --> 08:23:09.900
Well, no, I can't do my freaking laser beam

08:23:11.820 --> 08:23:14.860
I didn't even hurt him. I hurt them all

08:23:19.660 --> 08:23:21.660
Um

08:23:22.620 --> 08:23:26.540
Oh, there's keys behind every boss room, okay

08:23:29.580 --> 08:23:31.580
We need to defeat every single one

08:23:34.940 --> 08:23:39.580
Just fine with me, I'm sure I'm sure can be a big girl

08:23:41.660 --> 08:23:43.660
Yeah, thank god it wasn't wait

08:23:44.940 --> 08:23:50.060
There's a platform there, right? I'm uh heal up fully because I like being able to shoot from my weasel or my

08:23:51.900 --> 08:23:56.380
Um, sorry if it is tedious, but it's the only way I know how to play game

08:23:58.380 --> 08:24:00.380
Oh my god, I can't believe it

08:24:00.380 --> 08:24:02.220
A gamer that's bad at games

08:24:02.220 --> 08:24:03.740
Saying so

08:24:03.740 --> 08:24:08.540
I will not go kind of like so carry me home. Oh, I never sung that during the time

08:24:13.660 --> 08:24:18.780
That would take me outside the castle, why would I want to go outside the castle at this point in time?

08:24:18.860 --> 08:24:20.860
A shortcut

08:24:30.060 --> 08:24:32.060
Oh wait, hold on hold on hold on

08:24:33.100 --> 08:24:38.860
No, no, let's get this clear. No, I hate those kind of guys. I hate the ones that do the freaking

08:24:42.140 --> 08:24:44.140
Yeah, you know what you're getting a bomb

08:24:44.700 --> 08:24:48.140
Let's see for all change that attitude. I think okay, maybe not

08:24:49.020 --> 08:24:51.740
Uh, maybe not maybe not hold on maybe we got a bit a bit too

08:24:52.780 --> 08:24:54.300
over over

08:24:54.300 --> 08:24:55.900
confident, um

08:24:55.900 --> 08:24:57.820
honest mistake truly

08:24:57.820 --> 08:25:03.420
Okay, he just swings and gets vulnerable, which I'm quite happy with but he does have that move which I do not like at all

08:25:04.540 --> 08:25:06.860
Am I just let them attack?

08:25:07.020 --> 08:25:14.220
Okay, okay, that's not bad. That's not bad. That's that's handle-able handle-able

08:25:15.900 --> 08:25:19.260
Instant loss. No, no, no instant loss. I'm good. I promise

08:25:20.220 --> 08:25:23.900
Fortunately, I'm not full health so I can't deal with all these

08:25:24.460 --> 08:25:26.780
Enemies. Thank god. I've been playing Isaac

08:25:27.980 --> 08:25:29.980
Uh, because yeah

08:25:29.980 --> 08:25:31.980
I

08:25:33.740 --> 08:25:36.140
Was a game wants me to have arrows curious

08:25:38.860 --> 08:25:42.700
Oh, that's why the game wants me to have arrows. Yes, the mystery's no more

08:25:43.740 --> 08:25:45.900
All right, get me away from that, please

08:25:47.980 --> 08:25:49.980
Truly a mystery

08:25:55.260 --> 08:25:57.260
I miss

08:25:57.260 --> 08:26:00.460
Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. We made it. We got we got what we wanted

08:26:02.460 --> 08:26:06.140
Had to clean the cat food bowl and I'm back. What did I miss? Um

08:26:10.540 --> 08:26:12.540
Me getting rolled, um

08:26:14.140 --> 08:26:17.020
So I can only go this way but I can only drop down

08:26:18.060 --> 08:26:20.060
Don't go up

08:26:20.620 --> 08:26:21.980
Nope

08:26:21.980 --> 08:26:25.420
Nice try nice try nice try not happening

08:26:28.220 --> 08:26:30.220
What's upstairs

08:26:31.260 --> 08:26:33.260
Ta-da

08:26:34.380 --> 08:26:37.420
Came back from walking my dog. We're still in the castle

08:26:38.460 --> 08:26:41.980
Um, I've ordered food. So I'm just waiting for it to come

08:26:43.340 --> 08:26:47.500
And and I'm gonna refuel because I think this boss fight is gonna be there. Oh

08:26:47.500 --> 08:26:49.500
Is

08:26:56.620 --> 08:26:59.500
Is this just the way to teleport out with the bird if I want it

08:27:01.900 --> 08:27:03.900
I mean

08:27:14.380 --> 08:27:16.700
Is there a platform coming towards me maybe

08:27:18.220 --> 08:27:20.220
I

08:27:26.220 --> 08:27:28.220
Am I missing

08:27:36.540 --> 08:27:40.620
This just seems like a dead end and I can't go back

08:27:40.620 --> 08:27:42.620
I

08:27:43.260 --> 08:27:45.580
Can go back my apologies. I can go back

08:27:47.020 --> 08:27:52.940
Due to my foolish. Oh, of course. Ah, lovely. Thanks for respawning. Don't ever ever come back again

08:27:55.180 --> 08:27:57.180
Let us heal with the fairies

08:28:00.300 --> 08:28:04.060
Map check and you go bottom left and bottom right now

08:28:04.060 --> 08:28:06.060
Oh

08:28:09.180 --> 08:28:12.860
Maybe check the map out there. Uh, yeah, you're actually pretty valid for that

08:28:15.260 --> 08:28:17.760
Now I'm just to pick up the chest

08:28:30.380 --> 08:28:32.380
Yeah, I'm to go down

08:28:34.060 --> 08:28:36.060

What's the quay expect and I'm gonna be honest bro, my foot's gonna be here soon. Please stop leave me alone

08:28:50.300 --> 08:28:56.620
You have to understand. I'm just a hungry streamer. Okay. Ow. What a fucking wingspan on that bloody sword

08:28:58.060 --> 08:29:00.060
Fucking

08:29:00.300 --> 08:29:02.300
Hey

08:29:06.460 --> 08:29:07.580
Mate

08:29:07.580 --> 08:29:11.420
Yous are actually too OP. I'm not being funny, but you guys are actually a bit too OP

08:29:11.580 --> 08:29:17.660
Like I'm completely out of my depth against you two right now and you're both are doing different directions

08:29:21.500 --> 08:29:23.500
Oh, come on

08:29:24.060 --> 08:29:28.300
No, okay, hold on. This is going terrible. I'm gonna be honest

08:29:31.020 --> 08:29:34.780
Am I not just gonna say yeah, okay, we're just gonna fuck out of themselves

08:29:37.980 --> 08:29:43.660
Okay, okay, that's much more manageable one is much more manageable than two and absolutely no one is

08:29:45.580 --> 08:29:47.580
Much more manageable, okay

08:29:47.740 --> 08:29:53.420
Because of 1v1 this is fair. I'm literally a 12 year old boy and you're some sort of demon like this is getting a bit weird

08:29:53.580 --> 08:29:56.380
Honestly, why do you want a 12 year old boy in a room with you?

08:29:57.100 --> 08:29:59.100
Oh

08:29:59.500 --> 08:30:01.500
Yeah, yeah, that's what

08:30:03.660 --> 08:30:05.660
That's right cry to your mama

08:30:08.460 --> 08:30:10.460
What are we eating today, um

08:30:14.700 --> 08:30:19.500
Burger oh, that's the reason oh no logic puzzle

08:30:26.700 --> 08:30:36.780
Okay, sorry, I'd sorry if my model tracking so I had to put my hand over my mouth to try hard so much for that

08:30:41.180 --> 08:30:45.580
Hey, I hurt one ghost in the rest or like I'm out I ain't doing this

08:30:48.620 --> 08:30:50.620
Okay

08:30:51.020 --> 08:30:53.020
I

08:30:54.780 --> 08:31:01.900
Got the worst makes considerable time on sorry as if you just did that you weren't even aiming at me

08:31:03.820 --> 08:31:05.740
Yeah, we're here

08:31:05.740 --> 08:31:10.060
Again just an outside of a castle curious curious. Let's go up to the treasure

08:31:11.260 --> 08:31:13.260
Yeah, there you go

08:31:13.420 --> 08:31:15.420
steakhouse burger

08:31:15.740 --> 08:31:18.300
Where am I with the steakhouse burger?

08:31:20.620 --> 08:31:23.260
I got a breakfast burger I got bacon on it

08:31:26.060 --> 08:31:30.780
Uh a restock room wow, they're actually being nice how much all right

08:31:30.780 --> 08:31:33.660
I'm gonna go get some more bombs because the bombs are the only way I'm winning

So I'm just gonna keep restocking. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute games actually being kind

08:31:45.180 --> 08:31:47.740
Oh no logic puzzles proceeded to do it in three seconds

08:31:47.980 --> 08:31:51.980
The only reason I know how to do those kind of puzzles is because of pokemon ruby

08:31:53.260 --> 08:31:56.620
There is an ace tape gem where you had to do something like that

08:31:57.740 --> 08:31:59.500
and

08:31:59.500 --> 08:32:03.660
And it took me so long to learn as a child one earth I was supposed to do

08:32:05.900 --> 08:32:10.380
Oh, is there a heart in here? Oh, there's lovely lovely jubbly don't have to put the theme

08:32:11.340 --> 08:32:13.900
Shawnee can I have some of your bacon you can?

08:32:18.700 --> 08:32:25.180
Great, okay, this is one be one the way I like or is this a drill guy? I'm getting nervous. Oh it is as well

08:32:26.780 --> 08:32:32.220
I don't know. I kind of want him to drill because I can just shoot from oh well if I don't mess up my shot shoot

08:32:34.220 --> 08:32:37.660
Okay, well that ability is gone just like that

08:32:40.380 --> 08:32:42.380
Oh

08:32:48.060 --> 08:32:52.540
My god, that was clean that was clean mr.

08:32:55.820 --> 08:32:58.860
What's the job a four-way

08:33:03.820 --> 08:33:06.700
I have no idea how I'm supposed to serve this room

08:33:11.180 --> 08:33:13.180
So you think I'm skinny

08:33:16.700 --> 08:33:18.700
Hold on oh that works no way

08:33:22.300 --> 08:33:24.300
Oh

08:33:24.300 --> 08:33:28.700
Shadow was really good you can cast spells somewhere else me

08:33:31.180 --> 08:33:33.180
Great up top to get the goose

08:33:34.220 --> 08:33:38.860
She's getting too good at this that was incredibly lucky because of his attack pattern could have been different

08:33:39.580 --> 08:33:43.580
We now have four keys. Where do we took the keys? I don't know

08:33:44.860 --> 08:33:46.860
Are you gonna do a pokemon stream?

08:33:48.300 --> 08:33:52.220
Let's see tomorrow the heart's covering up your message again. Is this just

08:33:55.900 --> 08:33:57.900
Absolutely no comment

08:33:59.820 --> 08:34:03.500
No comment whatsoever. I'm gonna go get a fairy

08:34:04.380 --> 08:34:09.580
Hey, are you gonna do a pokemon streams too strong? Yes. Okay. I'm eating. I'm sorry. The heart was in the way

08:34:09.660 --> 08:34:11.660
I keep forgetting to move the heart of the way

08:34:14.060 --> 08:34:16.060
No that way

08:34:17.100 --> 08:34:20.460
Uh, yes, I will most likely do pokemons

08:34:22.300 --> 08:34:24.300
Um

08:34:26.540 --> 08:34:28.700

Where's the fairy room? I think it's back up here

08:34:32.140 --> 08:34:36.460
So I don't want to waste my heals just because of the dire situation

08:34:36.460 --> 08:34:38.620
We're gonna be in when we actually go against the boss

08:34:39.180 --> 08:34:42.460
I would much rather throw my bimmering at this thing over and over again

08:34:44.540 --> 08:34:46.540
Uh

08:34:46.540 --> 08:34:51.340
We'll do pokemon three four and five, which is pokemon

08:34:52.860 --> 08:34:54.860
emerald

08:34:54.860 --> 08:34:56.060
pear

08:34:56.060 --> 08:35:01.020
Diamond and white are the generations i'm familiar with

08:35:01.740 --> 08:35:04.140
There's something ahead that I couldn't get access to

08:35:09.260 --> 08:35:14.220
Oh, it's literally what four the keys were four my bad

08:35:19.340 --> 08:35:21.340
Yeah, they don't need jumping maybe helping

08:35:23.900 --> 08:35:27.900
Which one's your favorite pokemon but my first one was three

08:35:28.860 --> 08:35:33.660
So it has like a special place. Oh, no, we have the boss door key

08:35:40.060 --> 08:35:42.380
Where's the boss up here on floor three

08:35:44.460 --> 08:35:46.460
How do I get there?

08:35:51.580 --> 08:35:56.540
The door it's upstairs. Oh, I just need to go around an alpha thing

08:35:58.220 --> 08:36:00.220
Do apologize for my

08:36:02.220 --> 08:36:04.220
Which starter

08:36:05.580 --> 08:36:07.580
Oh, no tar chick

08:36:08.300 --> 08:36:15.260
And tar chick was so OP. Oh as soon as tar chick turns into blaziken, bro. You're OP as any of him

08:36:16.140 --> 08:36:21.180
Oh, no, I don't know if I want to go in. I'm gonna have to pause if my delivery comes

08:36:22.140 --> 08:36:24.140
Oh

08:36:24.460 --> 08:36:26.460

08:36:35.980 --> 08:36:38.860

Oh my god, it's cold. Oh well my delivery's here right hold on hold on

08:36:47.260 --> 08:36:49.260
Hold on give me a minute. Oh

08:36:49.740 --> 08:36:53.900
I'll be a second. I'll be a second. I'm gonna refuel. I'm gonna get food in me before I do this boss fight

08:36:53.900 --> 08:36:57.340
Because I know this is gonna be angry scottish mode. I can already tell

08:37:19.260 --> 08:37:21.260
So

08:37:49.260 --> 08:37:51.260
So

08:38:20.220 --> 08:38:22.220
So

08:38:34.460 --> 08:38:37.260
I hate my delivery guy went off of my can of spray

08:38:41.740 --> 08:38:45.980
Well, I hope you enjoyed it because I have cola in the fridge that was lucky. I'm not region

08:38:45.980 --> 08:38:47.980
Um

08:38:52.220 --> 08:38:57.020
I've got my burger and it's absolutely outrageously large. I'll see one thing about Australia

08:38:57.260 --> 08:39:00.380
You guys do not mess around for your food portion sizes

08:39:02.380 --> 08:39:05.820
You're starting to get a bit um American

08:39:07.660 --> 08:39:13.660
Hey, I don't know. I think he may have accidentally forgot to give it to me, which is fine. It's not it's literally can of spray

08:39:14.620 --> 08:39:21.100
She will port it now. I'm sure he just left it in the car. I rolled out. It's fine

08:39:22.620 --> 08:39:28.540
Oh my god, the chips are cheesy and they're so good. We fun. You need to take a bite. It's so good

08:39:32.780 --> 08:39:38.940
I'm most laid-back customer in the world probably because I was a waitress and like I mean I fucked up. It's just happened

08:39:40.220 --> 08:39:41.660
um

08:39:41.660 --> 08:39:44.940
You know, I've never had anyone be I'm gonna report you to your boss or whatever

08:39:45.820 --> 08:39:48.140
Meanwhile, my boss is literally always on my side

08:39:53.580 --> 08:39:55.580
Chips like chips

08:39:58.700 --> 08:40:03.420
Like chips like I'm made of a potato and deep-fried

08:40:07.580 --> 08:40:09.580
But cheese

08:40:12.620 --> 08:40:14.620
And

08:40:17.340 --> 08:40:22.140
My place doesn't get scotland getting americanized. Do you guys ever watch beard meets food?

08:40:22.140 --> 08:40:28.300
It's this guy that eats like a stupid amount of food and he travels to america to make his content

08:40:28.700 --> 08:40:33.900
Because america has such large portions that are like good for sensationalizing in his videos

08:40:37.260 --> 08:40:40.540
He's like I'm going to america again

08:40:41.660 --> 08:40:44.780
I'm going to america again. I'm doing a tour of america

08:40:52.780 --> 08:41:00.460
We do big, uh, literally the girls were telling me about american food and all the places they take me to and I'm like, oh, please kidnap me

08:41:01.900 --> 08:41:04.460
I'm like such a fat bastard. I love food

08:41:06.460 --> 08:41:09.340
Um, it would be nice to pick out on american food

08:41:12.540 --> 08:41:14.700
Hmm and like

08:41:18.220 --> 08:41:25.340
I I think the mexican food would be better in america because you'll never guess what's next to america. Mexico crazy. I know right?

08:41:26.140 --> 08:41:27.820
um

08:41:27.820 --> 08:41:29.740
and uh

08:41:29.740 --> 08:41:33.100
But apparently street vendors are like a lot more popular

08:41:35.420 --> 08:41:40.460
And I love me some I think they're called dirty tackles if they're from a street vendor and I'm like fuck. Yeah

08:41:40.460 --> 08:41:42.460
That's like my kind of food

08:41:44.940 --> 08:41:47.900
American mexicans actually pretty bad. Oh, no

08:41:48.700 --> 08:41:51.340
Oh, no, only the mexican food is good in Mexico. No

08:41:52.780 --> 08:41:55.100
I thought because it's literally land connected

08:41:57.580 --> 08:42:01.420
Yeah, be good. They are like a taco truck. I'd absolutely die for a taco truck

08:42:03.100 --> 08:42:05.260
Um, there's like no street vendors

08:42:06.060 --> 08:42:07.980
Are hardly any

08:42:07.980 --> 08:42:13.020
Sorry, I'm just choking on a chip there. Excuse me. This is what happens

08:42:13.580 --> 08:42:16.700
If you're talking in stream at the same time eating stream at the same time

08:42:17.820 --> 08:42:20.940
Um, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Don't worry. Um

08:42:22.780 --> 08:42:27.500
The the only like british takeaway pop-up shop

08:42:28.220 --> 08:42:33.580
I can think of is a fucking potato a baked potato van thing

08:42:33.740 --> 08:42:37.260
It got really popular on tiktok and it was like the british

Like takeaway thing truck is a freaking baked potato stand, which is hilarious

08:42:47.500 --> 08:42:49.500
Well

08:42:49.740 --> 08:42:54.700
If you're east of mississippi, you can forget about authentic mexican food. No

08:42:58.060 --> 08:43:03.420
They put beans on the baked beans and potato and baked potatoes absolutely delicious

08:43:03.820 --> 08:43:05.820
Right, let's take a break of this

08:43:05.980 --> 08:43:12.700
Bait of this breakfast burger. Um, it's got an egg on it baking on it hash brown on it. Oh

Delicious not nutritious, but delicious. I'm gonna need this for a the boss fight. We're about to do

08:43:27.660 --> 08:43:29.660
American mexican each

08:43:29.740 --> 08:43:31.740
It's

Jacket potatoes. Oh, we can't be potatoes. You come jacket potatoes because they're in a jacket. Yeah

08:43:40.140 --> 08:43:42.140
Oh my god, the egg is running

08:43:50.220 --> 08:43:52.220

08:43:53.900 --> 08:43:58.780
Oh, no, this can't be I don't think I like it that much but the chips were delicious though

08:43:59.900 --> 08:44:01.900
Oh

08:44:05.820 --> 08:44:09.100
They put something funny tasting in it. I didn't care what it is

08:44:12.620 --> 08:44:15.100
What's that flavor I have no idea

08:44:20.380 --> 08:44:25.180
I'm like continue to eat it anyway because I'm a fat bastard but I have no clue what it is

08:44:25.740 --> 08:44:27.740

On the top of the burger. No wonder. Oh my god. It's a breakfast burger because it's fucking astralian

08:45:11.420 --> 08:45:18.060
They've put smashed avocado on the top of it. No wonder that was tasting weird. I'm like, where's my fucking

08:45:18.940 --> 08:45:21.340
I've just noticed I'm eating something green

08:45:23.100 --> 08:45:25.100
Green

08:45:26.860 --> 08:45:28.860
There's your Mexican food

08:45:28.860 --> 08:45:31.820
No, I do like avocado, but this is like

08:45:32.620 --> 08:45:38.140
On a savory burger and the avocado is like a whole different like palate

08:45:41.980 --> 08:45:46.060
Mm-hmm that makes sense. I was like, what the fuck am I tasting?

08:45:48.140 --> 08:45:54.700
I like the way she says avocado. What? How'd you say it? Avocado? Avocado?

08:45:59.260 --> 08:46:03.180
I hate surprise avocado. I didn't realize it came on the burger

08:46:06.540 --> 08:46:10.460
Yeah, they could go a bit confused literally supposed to be a savory break breakfast burger

08:46:10.780 --> 08:46:18.700
Oh, I will say, you know the memes about Australians going nuts for avocado toast. It's kind of true. I'm sorry. It's kind of true

08:46:23.420 --> 08:46:25.420
You say it normally

08:46:25.420 --> 08:46:27.420
Free shavakado

08:46:27.420 --> 08:46:29.420
Avocado

08:46:29.420 --> 08:46:31.420
Avocado

08:46:32.460 --> 08:46:34.220
Shivakado

08:46:34.220 --> 08:46:36.220
It sounds like a spell

08:46:36.460 --> 08:46:39.020
It sounds like a spelled way. I say avocado

08:46:39.980 --> 08:46:43.180
Avocado! Oh, no, it does actually sound like a spell

08:46:45.500 --> 08:46:47.500
Take that Voldemort avocado

08:46:50.540 --> 08:46:52.540
I'm awful

08:46:53.500 --> 08:46:56.540
Oh, it's ruining the fucking flavor

08:47:01.340 --> 08:47:03.340
Avocado cadavro

08:47:05.820 --> 08:47:07.820
I cast avocado

08:47:09.020 --> 08:47:12.300
Right, I'm gonna have to take off the top bun that has all the fucking

08:47:15.180 --> 08:47:18.700
Green on it. I'm eating now the top of the burger

08:47:24.060 --> 08:47:26.060
All right, yeah, that's so much better

08:47:27.740 --> 08:47:29.740
Oh my god

08:47:32.380 --> 08:47:34.620
Look, I don't know about you

08:47:35.340 --> 08:47:37.340
But the most pleasurable

08:47:38.460 --> 08:47:45.100
Non-sexual thing you can do is fucking eat a greasy ass burger when you're hungry

08:47:45.980 --> 08:47:49.740
And appreciate the flavors that are swimming in your mouth, okay?

08:47:53.820 --> 08:47:55.820
Is that like come on

08:47:56.140 --> 08:48:01.260
You know and what other what other pleasures of the flesh that are not factual in nature

08:48:02.220 --> 08:48:05.980
The sensation of falling asleep on a warm bed

08:48:06.220 --> 08:48:12.940
When you know you have absolutely nothing to wake up to you don't have to go anywhere the next day you can rot and bed the next day

08:48:17.740 --> 08:48:24.460
Hmm a burger releases a hundred units of dopamine which is close to an inking fest

08:48:25.420 --> 08:48:27.420
Um

08:48:30.300 --> 08:48:32.300
The flavor swing

08:48:33.100 --> 08:48:35.100
Oh my bacon

08:48:35.660 --> 08:48:39.900
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to wash my hands unfortunately because it's so greedy

08:48:49.580 --> 08:48:52.220
That is gonna fuel me for this fight that's ahead

08:48:53.180 --> 08:48:55.180
No, that was good. I took the

08:48:56.060 --> 08:49:01.500
The green shite away get that green get that healthy green shite out my fucking burger and chips

08:49:05.260 --> 08:49:07.260
Hmm

08:49:07.740 --> 08:49:12.540
No, it's like grease is not like flavor on my fingers. It's just very grease

08:49:15.020 --> 08:49:17.020
Grease a lightning

08:49:22.220 --> 08:49:24.220
You don't like when it gets messy

08:49:26.780 --> 08:49:31.260
Okay, give me one second the bathroom's literally just right there. So

08:49:32.380 --> 08:49:34.380
I'll be back in a moment second

08:49:52.940 --> 08:49:54.940
You

08:49:55.340 --> 08:49:57.340
You

08:49:57.340 --> 08:49:59.340
You

08:50:00.300 --> 08:50:02.300
You

08:50:20.620 --> 08:50:23.740
Okay, my belly is full of meat

08:50:24.380 --> 08:50:27.820
I have my reeflings to support me through this game

08:50:28.460 --> 08:50:34.380
I just want to warn anyone that mere season 10 minutes probably and even the box fight god damn

08:50:39.340 --> 08:50:41.740
I was gone for so long. Let me you don't have to make it up to me

08:50:44.620 --> 08:50:46.620
Okay

08:50:46.780 --> 08:50:48.780
What

08:50:48.780 --> 08:50:54.700
Whoa, here has a screensaver mode. I'm a cut off is my hypnosis. You're not to attack me when I'm asleep. Okay

08:50:56.460 --> 08:50:58.460
Architects

08:50:59.180 --> 08:51:01.180
Calling all

08:51:03.420 --> 08:51:10.220
Let's get this. Oh, thank god. I walked out. Holy crap. You are persistent, aren't you? I am

08:51:10.700 --> 08:51:12.700
He he he he

08:51:12.780 --> 08:51:16.380
So you've come to stop my little ceremony while you're too late

08:51:16.860 --> 08:51:21.580
A mere three more times of the bell will bring the ceremony to its end

08:51:22.300 --> 08:51:27.100
And with the third toll of the bell, I will become like a god

08:51:28.060 --> 08:51:32.300
And your precious princess Zelda will be nothing more than a cold

08:51:33.260 --> 08:51:35.260
dead stone

08:51:36.220 --> 08:51:38.220
There's no time quickly link to the ring

08:51:41.180 --> 08:51:43.660
To the roof to the roof. I don't have time for your games

08:51:48.380 --> 08:51:54.940
Did you hear that link hurry? There's only two times left. Wait. Am I actually being timed or am I being trolled?

08:51:57.020 --> 08:52:00.780
Am I being timed like I'm actually being timed hold on someone look it up. Am I being timed?

08:52:04.940 --> 08:52:07.820
Holy shit, right fuck it just do the swords and slash them

08:52:11.180 --> 08:52:13.180
Holy shit

08:52:16.300 --> 08:52:22.940
Get out the way get out the way. No, you don't need to pick up the freaking Kenstone piece. Holy shit. We're in a timer, bro

08:52:25.180 --> 08:52:26.940
Oh god

08:52:26.940 --> 08:52:30.460
Another bell is no no and right. It's a progression. It's a progress

08:52:33.420 --> 08:52:35.420
It's fine

08:52:40.540 --> 08:52:42.540
Oh

08:52:46.700 --> 08:52:53.340
Doesn't matter who I hit doesn't matter if I'm wasting bombs as long as I'm hitting someone bro as long as I'm hitting someone

08:52:58.700 --> 08:53:05.020
Doesn't matter doesn't matter honestly doesn't matter. I have fairies as well. I have fairies as well. Don't worry. I have fairies. I have time. I have time

08:53:05.980 --> 08:53:14.300
As soon as one goes down everything becomes 10 times easier. That's it. That's the truth as soon as one goes down

08:53:14.940 --> 08:53:16.940
One down. That's it. See

08:53:18.700 --> 08:53:20.700
All right, I'm gonna need to

08:53:21.740 --> 08:53:23.420
Okay, see

08:53:23.420 --> 08:53:29.420
That's fine. That's fine. Not problem. I wouldn't mind that. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Uh, sorry. I know I'm gonna I'm gonna fight with you and all that

08:53:29.420 --> 08:53:30.780
but

08:53:30.780 --> 08:53:35.180
Okay, he recovers far too quickly. So we're gonna just have to go for the old uh whack him

08:53:35.980 --> 08:53:38.140
Like that. Yeah, oh that's so good

08:53:38.940 --> 08:53:44.140
Whoa, this guy's fast. He's like really he's hardly given me a chance to breathe

08:53:45.740 --> 08:53:50.140
Okay, okay, let's go. Can I get hearts? Yes, absolutely would love some hearts

08:53:51.500 --> 08:53:53.500
I would love to have

08:53:53.580 --> 08:53:58.460
Fucking thingy, but it's fine. Doesn't matter. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

08:54:01.740 --> 08:54:07.580
Oh, this looks like a boss fight if I've ever seen one. Hold on. I need to roll my shoulders for this

08:54:07.660 --> 08:54:09.820
You're welcome to roll your shoulders with me

08:54:11.900 --> 08:54:14.700
Oh, I'm taking a drink of cola. I'm feeling nervous

08:54:17.020 --> 08:54:21.100
Just a few more moments in the ceremony would have been complete

08:54:21.580 --> 08:54:23.980
You really are obsessed with stopping me, aren't you?

08:54:24.620 --> 08:54:29.340
Very well. I have not yet drained all of the light force housed in princess Zelda

08:54:29.340 --> 08:54:35.820
But what I should have should suffice. I shall be transformed unstoppable

08:54:36.140 --> 08:54:40.140
But let me first attend to the pesky worms who would trifle with me

08:54:40.220 --> 08:54:42.700
Well, if I'm a worm, you're about to get wrecked by me

08:54:43.340 --> 08:54:45.340
By a wiggly worm

08:54:46.380 --> 08:54:49.500
I'm in the glory hole. No, what? I just finished the fight

08:54:52.140 --> 08:54:54.140
Huh

08:54:54.620 --> 08:55:00.300
I will have no more of your interfering with my plans. Let me show you my true power

08:55:00.380 --> 08:55:06.300
Monkaos is a boss fight in this tiny-ass room. Am I about to fight a master bath boss in a tiny-ass room?

08:55:08.780 --> 08:55:10.780
What the hell even is that?

08:55:13.020 --> 08:55:15.020
Um, um

08:55:15.900 --> 08:55:18.220
Um, um, um suck them suck them

08:55:19.740 --> 08:55:22.140
I'm sucking. I'm sucking. I'm sucking

08:55:22.700 --> 08:55:26.060
Um, what am I to do? Am I to throw boomerangs?

08:55:27.020 --> 08:55:31.820
Nope, not boomerangs. Oh, right. Just twat them. Just twat them. It's fine. Just twat them when they go around the room

08:55:32.940 --> 08:55:37.100
Okay, that's fine. Not interested. Not interested. Not interested

08:55:38.220 --> 08:55:45.100
Okay, just twat it. I take that. Yeah, you like that right and then what looks like her eyeball is open. He his eyeball. Sorry

08:55:46.380 --> 08:55:48.380
Let's not make gender in this day and age

08:55:49.340 --> 08:55:55.900
Okay, that did something. I don't know what something's happening. I can hardly see I need to get close to see what the fuck

08:55:55.900 --> 08:55:58.540
I'm supposed to be hitting. Where's the other one?

08:55:59.180 --> 08:56:03.500
Take that. Yeah. Yeah, you're quivering. Your little boots are shaking. Yeah, take that. Oh

08:56:04.540 --> 08:56:07.660
What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna respond some more for me? Yeah. Yeah

08:56:09.980 --> 08:56:14.300
Oh, you don't like it. Oh, oh your little eyeball doesn't like it. You're too you're quaking

08:56:15.260 --> 08:56:19.100
I'm fucking scared. I'm not gonna lie. Uh, am I doing this right? I don't think I'm doing this right

08:56:21.260 --> 08:56:25.500
Oh, I can I can hit it. I can hit it. Okay. Is your problem? I can actually hit it for damage

08:56:26.300 --> 08:56:30.780
Okay, okay. We're we've got four balls now. We've got four balls. That's an upgrade. That's an upgrade. That's an upgrade

08:56:31.020 --> 08:56:34.140
That's a difference. We're sniping it. Could you imagine if I hit that?

08:56:37.100 --> 08:56:41.580
Okay, okay, sorry, uh, let me just grab. Oh, no. Okay, great. That was ahead

08:56:42.540 --> 08:56:44.540
I'm a fucking oh

08:56:45.100 --> 08:56:48.940
I'm a firing the laser. That's fine. You're allowed to do that. It's fine. You're allowed to have a laser beam

08:56:49.020 --> 08:56:51.580
Like I have a I have a few items that you don't have so it's fine

08:56:52.380 --> 08:56:55.180
Whoa, where did it go? Don't do that

08:56:56.460 --> 08:56:58.460
Don't do that. Don't do that

08:56:58.700 --> 08:57:00.700
Don't do that. That's so nice

08:57:02.140 --> 08:57:05.740
Okay, okay, get twired get twired get twired get twired. Oh

08:57:07.260 --> 08:57:08.620
Okay

08:57:08.700 --> 08:57:10.540
Okay, take it easy

08:57:10.540 --> 08:57:14.860
No, it's fine. Take it get twired get twired. Nope miss. It's fine. I'm allowed to miss

08:57:15.660 --> 08:57:17.660
Oh, I get to that

08:57:17.980 --> 08:57:19.500
Oh, no

08:57:19.500 --> 08:57:21.500
No, just quaking in your little boots

08:57:23.420 --> 08:57:27.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Danny suck those away. I do not like to look those

08:57:27.980 --> 08:57:33.500
I do. Oh my god. They have a fucking invincibility slope right spin right now so I can get the other two, right?

08:57:33.500 --> 08:57:35.500
That's fine. That's fine. I can tolerate that

08:57:35.580 --> 08:57:41.900
Okay, I can't tolerate that though. That's HP damage again with the damage again with the damage

08:57:43.340 --> 08:57:46.700
So much so unkind so unruly

08:57:49.100 --> 08:57:55.900
Again, I can't be making mistakes like this. I do have three fairies, but I cannot be making damage mistakes like that

08:57:56.300 --> 08:57:58.300
Oh lovely. I can't even reach you

08:57:58.380 --> 08:58:00.380
That's fine. I didn't want to reach you anywhere

08:58:00.940 --> 08:58:03.180
Come here. Oh not again

08:58:03.420 --> 08:58:05.420
Okay, that's fine

08:58:09.420 --> 08:58:16.140
Link, I know your arse is on fire and it hurts so badly, but I'm gonna have to ask you to please stop taking damage

08:58:16.140 --> 08:58:20.300
Darlin link. We're trying to save Zelda and I do not I

08:58:22.060 --> 08:58:24.940
I do not have infinity. Oh my god. There was a fairy in the jar

08:58:25.740 --> 08:58:27.740
We love fairy we love

08:58:30.140 --> 08:58:32.140
Okay, perfect

08:58:34.140 --> 08:58:36.780
I was gonna say let's not get hit by the fire

08:58:37.980 --> 08:58:42.620
I have to deal with that, but I don't have a choice. Miss. That's fine

08:58:44.860 --> 08:58:46.860
I just couldn't even get hit in

08:58:48.140 --> 08:58:52.460
Okay, hold on. No, we didn't get it. Oh piss

08:58:52.940 --> 08:58:58.140
Well, you seem to have some fight in you. I commend your bravery, but you will not survive this

08:58:58.700 --> 08:59:00.700
Oh

08:59:01.260 --> 08:59:05.900
God girl, I'm filled with the power. Okay, hold on hydration check

08:59:08.860 --> 08:59:14.140
I'm filled with the power that you cannot begin to understand. Do you think that puny sword will save you from me?

08:59:18.940 --> 08:59:22.860
Um no is my answer

08:59:22.860 --> 08:59:24.860
Uh

08:59:26.380 --> 08:59:29.980
No, I do not think the puny sword will save me but

08:59:30.620 --> 08:59:32.620
Does it mean I'm not that I suck them up

08:59:33.420 --> 08:59:35.420
I don't suck them up

08:59:36.140 --> 08:59:38.140
Oh

08:59:39.580 --> 08:59:41.580
I can't do any oh I can

08:59:42.300 --> 08:59:45.580
They're cobble wobbles. They're cobwebs. It's fine. They're cobwebs

08:59:47.260 --> 08:59:49.260
I can deal with cobwebs

08:59:49.260 --> 08:59:54.940
All right, let's just spin. Let's just clear up the map. Let's just clear up the map so we don't really have any issues

08:59:56.860 --> 09:00:01.820
What's the dealio? What's the plan? What's the deal? What's the plan? I don't know

09:00:02.460 --> 09:00:08.220
I clearly have to make their eye shape, but you're not transforming for me big batty

09:00:10.220 --> 09:00:12.220
But electroshock that's fine

09:00:16.780 --> 09:00:18.780
Again

09:00:19.980 --> 09:00:22.620
I mean, I'll clean them up

09:00:37.500 --> 09:00:41.500
Can I get help from these as well? Possibly. Am I to shoot it in the eyeball?

09:00:43.260 --> 09:00:48.460
Must be because you're not doing anything about it. Like you're honestly just kiss arse about no you are

09:00:49.340 --> 09:00:51.340
I

09:00:51.660 --> 09:00:53.660
That's it. That's my window of opportunity

09:00:57.260 --> 09:00:59.260
Oh

09:01:03.660 --> 09:01:05.660
Is this a joke or

09:01:09.020 --> 09:01:11.020
Lovely no do that again

09:01:13.420 --> 09:01:15.420
I think I'm getting trolled I can't tell

09:01:16.780 --> 09:01:18.780
I mean, it's red

09:01:18.940 --> 09:01:23.260
Is it is it narrow? Nope. I'm looking short

09:01:29.900 --> 09:01:31.900
I'm looking short for that

09:01:35.820 --> 09:01:37.820
I might have to reach out, give me

09:01:49.020 --> 09:01:51.340
Hmm I think I'm missing something

09:02:01.020 --> 09:02:05.900
Shoot at the ball feigned all the eyes it flashes for a frame when you hit it. I think

09:02:06.860 --> 09:02:11.020
Shooting the closed eyes opens them reveal which eye

09:02:11.980 --> 09:02:13.980
Oh

09:02:14.060 --> 09:02:19.180
Oh wasted all that time my apologies my apologies. Sorry. I don't need to waste your time

09:02:20.140 --> 09:02:22.140
Okay, we understand we understand

09:02:23.260 --> 09:02:25.260
So a few mechanics to learn that's

09:02:25.820 --> 09:02:29.340
Right, okay, we understand we have to hit all four. That's perfectly fine, right?

09:02:30.300 --> 09:02:32.300
Can we do it in time?

09:02:33.020 --> 09:02:35.020
Oh, we absolutely can ladies and gentlemen

09:02:35.420 --> 09:02:42.700
Okay, okay, okay, that's perfectly fine that makes sense why they keep spawning

09:02:43.260 --> 09:02:50.860
No, it's four bottom again. That's perfectly fine. Okay. Thank you. Sorry for your patience. Thank you for your patience. Sorry for um

Okay, absolutely absolutely loving it. Okay. We're on fire. We're cooking by gas

09:03:03.580 --> 09:03:11.260
We are gonna have to clear up this map over. Oh, that was unfortunate unfortunate hit did not mean that uh, very unfortunate

09:03:12.620 --> 09:03:15.660
Uh, right. I can see what one we're supposed to hit next

09:03:16.780 --> 09:03:21.100
Oh, oh dear unfortunately, um, I'm just gonna clear the map if

09:03:22.220 --> 09:03:29.580
Because it's getting a bit crowded and that is currently stuck to the right side and I actually need to shoot something on the right side

09:03:29.900 --> 09:03:31.900
All right, there we go

09:03:32.860 --> 09:03:34.860
There we go. There we go. Okay

09:03:35.660 --> 09:03:37.660
All right, sweet. Oh, I can't

09:03:38.460 --> 09:03:40.460
Do it if you're doing your electoral shot

09:03:44.540 --> 09:03:46.380
Okay

09:03:46.380 --> 09:03:52.700
Take your time. Take your time. Take it easy. Take it easy. Right. Same thing again. Cancel shoot. Uh red. We've got red

09:03:52.780 --> 09:03:55.020
We've got red. We've got red. Yeah, I love this

09:03:56.700 --> 09:03:58.220
Um, I'm not

09:03:59.100 --> 09:04:04.220
Moving fast now. I think we're in us. We're in a phase. We must be in a further phase

09:04:05.340 --> 09:04:07.340
Because that's outrageous as fast

09:04:07.660 --> 09:04:12.620
But lovely. Um, not really looking for that please don't do that again question mark

09:04:19.100 --> 09:04:21.100
What are we doing? What are we looking at?

09:04:21.260 --> 09:04:27.740
Not that side top maybe no bottom. Yeah. No. Wow all right side. Okay. We can handle that

09:04:27.980 --> 09:04:32.220
Yeah, that is moving so fast now like so fast. Sorry. I'm gonna have to clear this up a bit

09:04:32.860 --> 09:04:36.140
Just doing a bit of spring cleaning than you might need me to get spring cleaning

09:04:36.700 --> 09:04:39.100
Most we're just uh getting me that ideal

09:04:39.900 --> 09:04:41.500
I'm missing

09:04:41.500 --> 09:04:44.940
I am missing like nothing on air. I'm fully moley. Holy moley

09:04:45.580 --> 09:04:49.980
Wow, I actually just took a bit of a hammering. I'm tempted to try a fairy

09:04:50.860 --> 09:04:57.580
I am very tempted to try a fairy. Thank you very much. Love you. Please come all the time. Um to me

09:04:57.820 --> 09:04:59.820
Because that was very cringey

09:05:00.780 --> 09:05:01.900
Um

09:05:01.900 --> 09:05:03.020
Mate

09:05:03.020 --> 09:05:07.420
I really don't want vati to be on that side of me when I spawn. Yes. That's what I did

09:05:13.420 --> 09:05:15.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

09:05:17.020 --> 09:05:25.180
What what is this madness? I have the power of a god. I haven't stoppable mate. How can I lose to a literal child?

09:05:26.140 --> 09:05:29.980
There you go. Let's not be a just out here. Okay, children have a lot of potential

09:05:30.940 --> 09:05:36.620
We did it. Wait, did we actually do it? You did it impressive. Now quickly. We must break the curse on zelda

09:05:36.620 --> 09:05:40.780
I'm is that actually done or is there more because I'm scared. There's like a secret boss

09:05:42.540 --> 09:05:46.620
Hi, so like this is use it on zelda. Absolutely

09:05:49.420 --> 09:05:51.420
Oh

09:05:51.660 --> 09:05:53.660
I lost her baby

09:05:55.900 --> 09:05:57.900
Princess

09:06:07.580 --> 09:06:11.180
It looks like the curse has been broken. I'm glad we made it in time

09:06:15.660 --> 09:06:20.460
No, the castle's collapsing. It's too dangerous here quickly. We must escape from the castle

09:06:22.220 --> 09:06:25.580
Oh my god, I think we actually did do it. Wait for real for real. We did it first try

09:06:26.140 --> 09:06:29.740
Hmm. The door is blocked. We have no choice head back to the sanctuary

09:06:31.260 --> 09:06:35.820
What is the sanctuary? Is it to the right? No, sorry. Uh, yeah, yeah sanctuary sanctuary. Yes

Come with me princess to the sanctuary

09:06:51.340 --> 09:06:53.340
Ah, not that way

09:06:55.660 --> 09:06:57.660
Ah the sanctuary

09:06:59.260 --> 09:07:01.260
Oh my god, princess come come come

09:07:01.260 --> 09:07:05.420
safe safe safe. Oh god, there is another fight. I knew it. I fucking knew there was another fight

09:07:06.220 --> 09:07:08.220
You will not escape boy

09:07:08.540 --> 09:07:14.940
No, you will see the true power of the light force for I have become batty the master of this world

09:07:16.700 --> 09:07:18.700
I knew it

09:07:18.700 --> 09:07:22.380
I knew it. That was I I succeeded too well

09:07:23.260 --> 09:07:27.660
I succeeded too well. Holy shit. I succeeded too well

09:07:29.180 --> 09:07:31.180
I succeeded too well

09:07:34.940 --> 09:07:37.020
What the fubber knock is this?

09:07:39.420 --> 09:07:41.420
Um

09:07:42.860 --> 09:07:44.860
What is this I don't know

09:07:45.420 --> 09:07:49.420
I don't know. I can become a minish

09:07:50.940 --> 09:07:52.940
Which is fine

09:07:53.740 --> 09:07:57.740
Well, I'm cornered now, aren't I? Oh, well, you know what I give up. You can have her

09:07:59.420 --> 09:08:01.980
Nope, not that definitely not that. Um

09:08:03.180 --> 09:08:07.980
What the fuck am I supposed to do to help? What do I do? What do I do? I don't know what to do

09:08:09.980 --> 09:08:14.460
Suffering from she kicked too hard. What a kill boss. He's got arms, but I did oh

09:08:14.860 --> 09:08:19.820
The cane the cane of course the cane man. I knew that. Thank you out

09:08:21.100 --> 09:08:23.100
No

09:08:23.260 --> 09:08:25.260
I think cane when he does that arm thing

09:08:30.460 --> 09:08:33.580
This nope miss missed again missed again

09:08:34.780 --> 09:08:38.620
Become a minish and go inside. I think there's a go inside moment to

09:08:40.380 --> 09:08:42.380
What

09:08:42.780 --> 09:08:44.780
I'm to destroy them all

09:08:45.820 --> 09:08:49.340
No, one is not like the others this one's not like the others

09:08:51.900 --> 09:08:53.900
You look different you must perish

09:08:56.700 --> 09:09:01.980
Okay, get out get out so we don't get hurt did that destroy the arm it did it did it did right?

09:09:01.980 --> 09:09:05.740
I have two fairies. I'm a bit nervous not gonna lie. I am very low

09:09:07.660 --> 09:09:12.940
Oh fuck off with the fucking like this tick health taking not good

09:09:14.940 --> 09:09:16.940
Oh god, can I do it?

09:09:18.460 --> 09:09:27.340
I rolled over dear dear little long. I know you're a young child. Oh lord. I can't see a dying thing

09:09:27.420 --> 09:09:29.420
Where's the one that doesn't look like him? You

09:09:33.260 --> 09:09:35.020
Sometimes

09:09:35.020 --> 09:09:37.020
sometimes

09:09:37.020 --> 09:09:39.500
Oh, that was so lucky. I came across that like instantly

09:09:40.380 --> 09:09:42.380
Oh god, what now?

09:09:43.340 --> 09:09:46.620
Don't whack them all. I'm I'm sorry. I think I'm gonna have to dump the fairy

09:09:47.740 --> 09:09:50.300
Oh, if we're gonna stick with even have full health for the last one though

09:09:51.180 --> 09:09:53.180
Even if I use the last fairy

09:09:53.420 --> 09:09:55.660
Is it triple time? I think I'm gonna be triple time

09:09:57.420 --> 09:10:02.380
Oh my god, it's a deflect. It's a deflect. I can see it. I can see the attack pattern. It's a deflect

09:10:04.460 --> 09:10:06.460
Oh lord

09:10:06.700 --> 09:10:11.900
It's a deflect. It's a deflect. It's a deflect. Nope. Not if you're gonna do that

09:10:12.540 --> 09:10:16.060
Not if you're gonna do that yet. That was so unlucky

09:10:17.100 --> 09:10:19.100
Because of that attack phase. I couldn't do it

09:10:20.380 --> 09:10:22.380
Again with this attack

09:10:28.220 --> 09:10:32.140
Oh, I cannot press that button any harder if I tried

09:10:37.100 --> 09:10:39.100
I don't I don't know what to do

09:10:39.820 --> 09:10:41.820
Okay, that's fine

09:10:45.420 --> 09:10:50.860
Oh, why why why I'm point blank, you know, I'm point blank. You're a wee liar

09:10:52.460 --> 09:10:54.460
I'm out of time

09:10:55.500 --> 09:10:57.500
Oh, you fucking pisser

09:11:00.300 --> 09:11:05.020
Absolute shit for brains who knew exactly what I'm not I can't do it because I'm gonna get hit by that electrode

09:11:09.260 --> 09:11:13.660
I didn't even call it a boss battle for nothing

09:11:30.060 --> 09:11:32.060
Oh no, I'm not ready

09:11:33.020 --> 09:11:35.020
But I don't have to be

09:11:35.020 --> 09:11:37.020
I don't have to be first try

09:11:37.500 --> 09:11:40.940
Fool but I the light forced my power. I had such power

09:11:42.380 --> 09:11:44.380
Did we do it first try?

09:11:46.700 --> 09:11:49.980
Actual gg or real gg like real gg

09:11:51.740 --> 09:11:56.300
Real gg the hat has returned real gg real gg

09:12:00.780 --> 09:12:02.780
Real gg

09:12:03.740 --> 09:12:05.740
Link thank goodness you're safe

09:12:06.620 --> 09:12:12.700
You defeated body. You're so brave, but we've lost so much the castle all those people

09:12:13.740 --> 09:12:17.420
Not any worry about it. No, I try my best any worry about it

09:12:17.820 --> 09:12:19.820
Ah

09:12:27.900 --> 09:12:33.340
What's this the curse defeating batty seems to have broken the curse he cast upon me

09:12:35.180 --> 09:12:43.660
Allow me to introduce myself to you princess Zelda. My name is Ezwo master of minish lore and sorcery

09:12:44.620 --> 09:12:51.180
The mages cap was my creation, but it's limitless power has caused nothing but trouble for your kind

09:12:52.780 --> 09:12:55.500
Is there any way that you can forgive me?

09:12:56.540 --> 09:13:00.700
I know many have fallen and much of the castle has been destroyed

09:13:01.580 --> 09:13:04.060
But it is too soon to give in to despair

09:13:05.100 --> 09:13:09.820
The curse on me is broken and Zelda still possesses some of the light force

09:13:10.700 --> 09:13:14.060
Perhaps together we can do something to make things right

09:13:17.260 --> 09:13:20.060
Focus focus through that piece on your focus

09:13:21.900 --> 09:13:25.420
If one sorry if one wears

09:13:26.300 --> 09:13:31.580
If one with a just heart wears this cap things can be made right again

09:13:32.540 --> 09:13:36.060
Princess Zelda let your wishes be made real

09:13:40.060 --> 09:13:42.700
I was gonna say focus focus through the pizza on your princess

09:13:49.740 --> 09:13:54.320
I wish to restore oh life as it once was

09:14:10.140 --> 09:14:14.140
Oh no troublemakers on the road

09:14:23.740 --> 09:14:25.740
I'll have peaceful

09:14:27.340 --> 09:14:29.340
And always restored in the world

09:14:30.860 --> 09:14:35.820
Look the castle all the people who had been turned to stone. They're all back to normal

09:14:40.540 --> 09:14:44.300
The hat it's fallen apart. It's overflowing with the power of life

09:14:45.020 --> 09:14:48.380
The hat has the power to turn the thoughts of its wearer into reality

09:14:48.940 --> 09:14:53.420
Vati's heart was filled with evil and that was reflected in what he became

09:14:54.940 --> 09:15:01.340
But it seems that Zelda's pure heart coupled with the hat's power has created a miracle

09:15:02.140 --> 09:15:04.140
Oh

09:15:04.540 --> 09:15:06.540
The portal is closing

09:15:06.620 --> 09:15:09.420
Hmm. It looks like the time for us to part has come

09:15:10.140 --> 09:15:14.940
The mini store opens but once every century and soon it must close

09:15:15.980 --> 09:15:19.580
I must leave you both now and return to my homeland

09:15:20.620 --> 09:15:22.860
I know I have caused you much suffering

09:15:23.420 --> 09:15:25.820
But the evil one's power has withered

09:15:26.540 --> 09:15:30.700
The power of princess Zelda herself has restored the light to Hyrule

09:15:31.740 --> 09:15:37.660
Well Link my journey with you has been exciting to say the least

09:15:38.620 --> 09:15:43.100
In fact, I'm more than just a little sad that we most part ways now

09:15:45.420 --> 09:15:47.420
Please accept this

09:15:51.660 --> 09:15:53.660
Oh, but it's not as low

09:15:54.540 --> 09:16:07.020
You know, I've never actually seen you wear in a cap until now. It suits you little hero. Take care

09:16:09.420 --> 09:16:11.180
Bye

09:16:11.180 --> 09:16:14.460
Thank you for the advice. Oh god. You're so tiny. Please be careful. I thought

09:16:15.420 --> 09:16:17.420
Bye buddy

09:16:17.740 --> 09:16:20.300
Farewell farewell my friend

09:16:21.260 --> 09:16:23.260
That's crazy small

09:16:31.820 --> 09:16:37.500
There he is a proud boy link we did it

09:16:40.060 --> 09:16:42.060
We did it

09:16:42.780 --> 09:16:44.780
He's

09:16:45.740 --> 09:16:50.300
Yeah, I don't know how big this team was but Matt hats off to this team

09:16:50.460 --> 09:16:54.460
The only thing they messed up on was in my opinion

09:16:56.380 --> 09:16:57.500
Was

09:16:57.500 --> 09:16:59.500
The ending should remain

09:16:59.580 --> 09:17:05.660
But I'm gonna show you something if I put up the game again. He's so small. He's five two. Whoa. Is there anyone?

09:17:06.700 --> 09:17:14.140
And now we only have 40 more games left in the timeline. Wait, there's 40 installments of Zelda. No way

09:17:15.660 --> 09:17:21.740
That's off. Yeah, okay. Actually, I didn't mean that hats off to the development team

09:17:29.180 --> 09:17:31.180
Sad thing, yes

09:17:31.980 --> 09:17:33.980
Broly legend

09:17:33.980 --> 09:17:35.980
You did amazing

09:17:36.140 --> 09:17:39.660
Thank you. Love you. Love you. Timmy's playing

09:17:39.660 --> 09:17:46.700
Is it like 15 mainline games? I did not know there was that many installments

09:17:49.420 --> 09:17:55.260
I know ocarina of time is rated very highly I believe. Oh my god. That's what they look like

09:17:56.540 --> 09:18:03.020
They have like a little feather tail. Oh my god gen two. What the fuck they're called picori gen two confirmed

09:18:03.580 --> 09:18:05.980
Little red and green inspiration little gold

09:18:06.940 --> 09:18:15.180
I'm here for a little adorable tail just yonking it straight from your nintendo. Thanks. I don't even have to think

09:18:18.460 --> 09:18:19.820
Hmm

09:18:19.820 --> 09:18:26.860
I can't believe I didn't mess that up. I thought I was gonna be in for a rage fest like replaying over and over again

09:18:27.820 --> 09:18:33.100
Oh, that's what that looks like sauce, but that looks like a chick. I'm sorry. That's like an emo chick

09:18:33.900 --> 09:18:35.900
But a gen two confirmed

09:18:37.100 --> 09:18:41.900
Original Zelda staff. Oh, this is a special thank you to the original

09:18:43.900 --> 09:18:47.900
Management nose take product management

09:18:49.900 --> 09:18:56.220
Are you shouting at? Oh my god. Link's taking it on the chin as Eslo shouts at him. That's adorable

09:18:56.220 --> 09:18:59.420
Link, what did you think doing making us jump in that whirlwind?

09:19:00.380 --> 09:19:09.100
Oh my god, that's such a cool friggin art that puts it into perspective how absolutely terrifying it is to be a picori

09:19:11.900 --> 09:19:13.900
Gender bent batty confirmed into

09:19:15.660 --> 09:19:18.380
Oh my god, that's such cool artwork. Oh

09:19:19.340 --> 09:19:21.500
And here we are with all our elements

09:19:22.380 --> 09:19:25.180
Dusted links quest come to an end

09:19:25.660 --> 09:19:30.940
But surely this is not the end of Zelda and Link's adventures in Hyrule

09:19:31.980 --> 09:19:33.980
The legend will continue

09:19:37.180 --> 09:19:41.100
As long as the power of light force echoes throughout the ages

09:19:42.460 --> 09:19:46.620
Oh, there's a wee picori bottom right if you see him next to the fire element

09:19:48.300 --> 09:19:50.300
Hold on as we clover

09:19:51.420 --> 09:19:53.420
All right, ah fuck off

09:19:53.420 --> 09:19:55.420
And then get bent

09:19:57.820 --> 09:20:04.380
Oh my god save absolutely save because that was a lot of progress not to save please save

09:20:07.340 --> 09:20:09.900
What this is a real what are you talking about this is a game boy van

09:20:10.460 --> 09:20:14.220
So this is the only what it's a real game boy van

09:20:15.660 --> 09:20:17.660
This is my only thing

09:20:18.220 --> 09:20:22.220
Wait, I have a triangle on my name. Why do I have triangle?

09:20:24.220 --> 09:20:31.340
Yeah, this is the only thing if you complete the game but come back everything is still wrong

09:20:31.980 --> 09:20:34.700
It's like it's as if you didn't do it

09:20:35.420 --> 09:20:40.780
Which is such a shame. It means you won. Imagine the game Christianina. Yeah, like I

09:20:42.140 --> 09:20:45.820
Now don't get me wrong for the explore. I don't I don't even know how I got there

09:20:46.540 --> 09:20:51.740
For the exploring side of things I completely get leaving the monsters in the game

09:20:52.540 --> 09:20:54.540
But I don't like it

09:20:54.540 --> 09:20:56.460
The post game could have

09:20:56.460 --> 09:21:01.580
Could have been much better in my opinion the post game should be the kingdom is restored

09:21:01.980 --> 09:21:07.020
And you know make up some plot line where like oh linky need to you know get rid of the stragglers type thing

09:21:07.100 --> 09:21:10.460
And maybe like kill all the monsters in the world and they perma stay away

09:21:11.260 --> 09:21:12.780
um

09:21:12.780 --> 09:21:15.740
It's too dangerous go home. Yeah, like everything's shut down

09:21:16.460 --> 09:21:19.180
No, that's why we like did all that exploring

09:21:19.980 --> 09:21:26.620
Um before because like everything gets all changed like the world is now permanently changed. We can't get to like pre

09:21:27.740 --> 09:21:29.020
this

09:21:29.020 --> 09:21:30.140
I think

09:21:30.140 --> 09:21:33.580
Breath of the wind and thingy did that. I could be remembering what wrong

09:21:35.580 --> 09:21:39.500
Yeah post games elder could be fun, but they've just never done it like don't get me wrong

09:21:39.660 --> 09:21:43.580
If the development team like it a certain way they like it a certain way. That's fine

09:21:44.620 --> 09:21:46.220
um

09:21:46.220 --> 09:21:52.540
But I have to admit for a player that especially is enthralled with a zelda series like this could have been

09:21:54.540 --> 09:21:56.540
This could have been a lot more fun

09:21:58.700 --> 09:22:03.580
Um a legend of zelda god that postman did that leap even I can't leap hold on

09:22:03.900 --> 09:22:05.900
How do you even I can?

09:22:06.540 --> 09:22:08.540
um, but yeah, there's like

09:22:08.620 --> 09:22:12.300
The only thing now really is we could just do code stone trading

09:22:12.540 --> 09:22:13.740
and

09:22:13.740 --> 09:22:15.580
Kinstone, but

09:22:15.580 --> 09:22:17.580
You know is what it is

09:22:17.900 --> 09:22:22.460
Closest you get is a password in the oracle game for the other game that implies you saved

09:22:23.260 --> 09:22:25.260
the other land first

09:22:28.140 --> 09:22:30.140
Um

09:22:30.940 --> 09:22:35.660
But yeah, like it's just such a shame like how it all is as a mayor here

09:22:36.620 --> 09:22:40.300
Monsters are coming everyone's standers. Oh that doesn't apply to you my boy link go get them

09:22:40.700 --> 09:22:42.700
You're your sword and braver. You'll save the day

09:22:45.100 --> 09:22:50.780
Um, yeah, it's such a shame because I think the post game could have been a lot more pretty like especially this in the situation

09:22:51.180 --> 09:22:54.540
Being all alone is uh, well lonely. I'm going to find myself a nice home too

09:22:57.100 --> 09:22:59.100
Um

09:22:59.260 --> 09:23:01.260
There's extra dungeon bosses

09:23:03.180 --> 09:23:09.580
Hey, wait, wait, wait for me. Um, but yeah, unfortunately, this is where it's like, uh, I really wish they didn't do that

09:23:11.260 --> 09:23:16.700
And but it's the development team's choice, but for me as a player

09:23:20.060 --> 09:23:23.100
Hi there, welcome. Sure. I'll take a rest. Um

09:23:24.700 --> 09:23:31.340
Wait, I'll take the 200 room, please and three girls to come in that'd be great. Thanks. Enjoy your stay

09:23:34.460 --> 09:23:37.180
Oh wait, we actually just straight up like stayed in a hotel

09:23:37.580 --> 09:23:39.580
Oh

09:23:39.980 --> 09:23:43.900
Well, yeah, I think we did it right. We should probably uh redirect into mercy. Hold on a minute

09:23:44.460 --> 09:23:47.580
We should uh redirect into mercy because uh, there's nothing else I can do

09:23:48.060 --> 09:23:53.980
Now I can get 100 but I honestly don't know what I'm missing and uh, we'd be at it for quite a while

09:23:55.260 --> 09:23:58.620
And I'm not really fussed for it because I have kind of corrupted the fail

09:23:59.420 --> 09:24:01.420
I've not corrupted it, but

09:24:01.580 --> 09:24:06.860
The fail is now stuck in this like things are blocked off everyone go home dialogue

09:24:06.860 --> 09:24:11.660
Which isn't that fun whereas like when you start the game everyone's like welcome to town

09:24:12.220 --> 09:24:14.220
Town love all that jazz

09:24:14.220 --> 09:24:16.220
But now it's like I'm messed up

09:24:16.940 --> 09:24:19.260
You know what we'll go home and we'll see grandpa

09:24:20.460 --> 09:24:26.620
Oh wait, he doesn't know that we've defeated fatty. Oh, no one knows we've defeated fatty. We can't even tell him

09:24:26.860 --> 09:24:28.860
Oh

09:24:28.940 --> 09:24:30.060
Oh, well

09:24:30.060 --> 09:24:36.780
I'm so good. Yeah, it's just the same dialogue. Which is a shame that fail should have been us three girls come with a 400 room

09:24:36.860 --> 09:24:38.860
I got 400

09:24:38.860 --> 09:24:40.860
and but yeah

09:24:41.500 --> 09:24:45.660
It's slow is on our head again type thing because we haven't done it

09:24:46.380 --> 09:24:51.500
It's just a complete time loop. Which is such a shame. I I definitely think it could have been

09:24:52.460 --> 09:24:57.260
A very adorable game if they did it right, I will make sure we're redirecting into mercy

09:24:59.340 --> 09:25:01.820
Should I pick any kind of support?

09:25:06.380 --> 09:25:08.380
Oh, she's playing death mark

09:25:09.900 --> 09:25:14.140
What what's the what's the question she says the title of the stream is do you have the red stuff?

09:25:15.100 --> 09:25:18.220
What's the red stuff the blue you got the blue?

09:25:18.220 --> 09:25:20.220
I

09:25:20.460 --> 09:25:24.940
Right, I'm gonna see if I can put me clapping a some more up

09:25:25.500 --> 09:25:28.140
I'm probably not gonna do it right now because I think it's a bad time to do it

09:25:29.420 --> 09:25:31.420
Where is my mercy?

09:25:33.580 --> 09:25:34.860
See

09:25:34.860 --> 09:25:36.860
redirecting to mercy

09:25:37.180 --> 09:25:42.060
But we did it. Thank you so so much for letting me turn a four hour stream into

09:25:42.940 --> 09:25:46.860
Nine and a half hours. Wow. Holy crap. It took me that long to piss off about

09:25:48.300 --> 09:25:52.940
How did I do that? Honestly, I freaking I just I'll just stream for a wee bit

09:25:53.580 --> 09:25:57.020
um tomorrow's streaming experience is

09:25:57.580 --> 09:26:05.980
Only a few hours of old-school runescape. I'm gonna go hard on the wine because I have my first collab with none other

09:26:07.020 --> 09:26:08.780
The mercy modis

09:26:08.780 --> 09:26:10.780
We're gonna play hong kong gifts game

09:26:11.420 --> 09:26:17.980
And we're gonna see what an earth goes on. Wow. We really endurance that I didn't even mean to like it was just like a little

09:26:18.380 --> 09:26:20.380
Oopsie. Whoopsie

09:26:20.860 --> 09:26:25.820
Thank you for showing us the minish cap. Oh, I'm so glad you could enjoy it for the first time if you've never seen it before

09:26:25.900 --> 09:26:27.900
It's just a cute little pixel game

09:26:28.460 --> 09:26:32.940
I think it's a very sweet game. Definitely if they had post games, I feel more fun

09:26:33.020 --> 09:26:36.700
But that's just me. Thank you so so much my little reeflings

09:26:36.780 --> 09:26:41.580
Um, I'll go talk in mercy stream for a wee bit because I don't know what on earth what kind of game she's playing

09:26:41.660 --> 09:26:44.620
But might as well watch it wee bit might as well watch it a wee bit

09:26:45.260 --> 09:26:46.540
um

09:26:46.540 --> 09:26:51.980
But thank you so so much billet reeflings. I'm so sorry to endurance you again and again night after night day after day

09:26:52.140 --> 09:26:54.140
I just can't help it. Okay. I need a lot of you

09:26:54.860 --> 09:26:57.900
And and I'll get a lot of you one way or another. Okay

09:26:59.020 --> 09:27:01.900
Right. Thank you so so much. I love you

09:27:02.140 --> 09:27:07.260
Please look after yourself and get a good stretch and a good water and a good sleeping because that was a

09:27:08.460 --> 09:27:10.460
A longer stream yet. It was a long stream

09:27:11.180 --> 09:27:15.740
Okay, we will redirect successfully into none other than mercy modis and we will be nice

09:27:16.300 --> 09:27:22.860
And we will be respectful because remember I'm a fiend for the ink, but you know, you got everyone has their different licks

09:27:22.940 --> 09:27:26.700
Okay, and mercy now might not be at the same lick as me. Okay

09:27:27.660 --> 09:27:30.780
All right. Thank you so so much. I'll see you tomorrow on rinse cable cable
