1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Check out the drip. Oh, what's that sort of emotion? Oh, I was trying to show the hoodie but hold on, hold on, easy, easy.

2
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This can go horribly wrong very quickly. Oh, it's me, me, me, me. Oh, oh, but what's that? What's this? Take the back, take the back.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, I'm trying so hard. I can't do this any more awkward. I'm literally on a diagonal in a vertical world.

4
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And also, also, just before anyone comments, yes, I'm insecure about my socks, okay?

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why am I insecure? Do you see the little bubbles? That means I've worn these socks tons, okay?

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So don't point out that my socks have all the bubbles on them. I'm insecure, okay?

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So don't move. Is that stain on the blanket? It's not that fucking terrible.

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know if you can see the shadow. Do you see that shadow? That's the microphone. You guys don't make pumping ASMR?

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, shade.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Nasty socks and this is exact.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Where is the canister?

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm used to start the canister. There's no pee. I repeat, there's no pee.

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But we've got water to mix with the poop and popping. And there's a marvel to motion with cola.

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Does cola drink in one's fortune? I fell in love with it.

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, it's that one character.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yep, that one character in Marvel.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm out of milk. I need to go to the shop.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I ran out of milk last night.

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, sorry. Oh, no, it's not ASMR. Get fucked.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can make all the loud noises. I won't get shagged.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Actually, I can make all the loud noises. It's because I've got an ASMR and I just do the rest of this and I'm never acting.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Unfortunately, I'm not going to glue my fake nails on because the glue and the manicure are still stuck on my fingernails.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I am like glistening, but not the good kind. There is good kind of glistening. This is not it.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How long since last shower?

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think yesterday. I put deodorant on because I was putting on the merchandise. I don't want to get it covered in bio.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's be honest. I'm not washing the clothes last to the stream. I'm taking them off again and we'll put other clothes.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, long story short, I have to put clothes on to stream. Okay? I've said it. I've said it. I don't normally do my things.

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How was your five hours of sleep?

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've got three. I've got three. I have had three hours for years.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Things are happening. Oh my god, I'm sorry. I forgot to do the dance.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Unfortunately, I've had three hours of slumber, but I have fantastic news update-wise, ASMR-wise.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I think I could do not have about eight ASMR audios on the way. I'm not even kidding.

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We normally don't wear clothes. No, I don't go outside, so it's not necessary. Three is not enough to go back to sleep.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It took me so long to put my stream up.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Right, so, you didn't know? I hit VTuber, Jimmy Bezu, my gen mate. She did a pop and cooking stream.

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And when I was buying my American snacks in that shop, I saw this.

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I was like, wait a minute. Ain't this what Emmy did?

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Like, this is genuinely what Emmy did. So, shout out to Emmy. Thank you for the inspiration.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's a goofy hand cam stream. You know how much this cost me?

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
$9.95 AUD. Shot in Behaviour.

41
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Bro, ask for an underword check. Did you record this all night?

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I was doing a lot of behind-the-scenes things that can't come into fruition yet.

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You must give me two months. Two months.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was fixing my donathon as well. There's a lot of things that were outdated or unachievable.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I wasn't right, so I'll open up, then we're gonna be doing loads of stuff that you won't see the fruition for.

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Until it's over, and all that jazz.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's it.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay, I think I'm supposed to cut this in a very particular way, because Emmy cut it in a particular way.

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, it's a dinner plate. Don't get too excited now.

50
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't, Joff, it's going to get too excited. A lot of reeds wind up.

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's got pop and cooking on the top.

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Right. I need to cut it a certain way, or did I make that up?

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There's, oh, who goes there? There's leaves and cuttons.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hold on, there is a box of instructions. Let's pretend I understand the instructions.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:30,000
One cup of rice, water, one quarter, one plastic of water to make the fake rice, roll it into an egg,

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
put it on a fried egg, or...

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm gonna need to know what's inside before I even have a excuse to do what's going on here.

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm gonna open it like this, and maybe regret it.

59
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, no, it's actually working out, and I'll hold on there.

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, I've got my next week's schedule.

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Do you want to see next week's schedule right now?

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I need to stand up and do it so you can see my feet.

63
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If this toy suffers, it's actually edible.

64
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But there's going to be cat hair in it, so it's up to you if you want to eat it or not.

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, look. Okay, cute.

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Whoa, this is a lot more complex than I...

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why are they giving me an empty cheese slice?

68
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why would they give me an empty cheese slice?

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Where's the cheese? If you're gonna give me it, at least give me the fucking cheese.

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The volume's a bit lower than usual.

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's probably the microphone.

72
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wait, hold on, I'll turn that. This is a bit...

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sorry, if you can see the shadow cast, I'm having to talk like this.

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No, this is very hard.

75
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, it's a mixing bag.

76
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you want me to artificially turn myself off?

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Because I'm screaming right now. I'm screaming in a room.

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, there's a spoon. That's so cute.

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh my gosh, there's like sprinkles and everything.

80
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh my gosh, that reflective surface for a V-tuber?

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I can't believe it.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It would be so selfish, reflective surface.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What do we got going on here today, Johnny?

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Thank you, reverse, for the super chat.

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We don't pop and cook in. I have no idea what I'm doing.

86
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Baby spoon. Baby spoon.

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I've got my volume maxed out.

88
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Right, I'm going to artificially turn myself up.

89
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay, I'm going to turn the knob.

90
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The knob has been turned.

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The knob's been turned, right.

92
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, what is this? Did Emmy cut this up?

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think she did.

94
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I think...

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There's a musical note here.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There's a four leaf clover here.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And then I assume this is the water one?

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Five cc's of water.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
She cut it up, but you don't have to.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, learning.

101
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So what's the deal?

102
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The yellow packet and one water.

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, I can do that.

104
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But where do I make it?

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There's like a bit of dirt in here.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's not looking good.

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Where am I?

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, I'm supposed to put the yellow one in here, so I'm going to do it.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Unless it has English on it, that tells me don't do that.

110
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Cream dual powder.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, and it's 100% as you're all my witness.

112
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yellow.

113
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yellow.

114
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yellow. Red.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Red, green, blue.

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is too complex for three hours of sleep.

117
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is a bit too much.

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I heard there were kittens.

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A Gimli might come in.

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She's a bit nervous.

122
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I didn't like anything being done.

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Slightly different than...

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't think I'm doing this one.

125
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, whoa, that smells so sweet!

126
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So gross.

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What do you mean this is just...

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I mean, it wasn't going to taste savory.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Put it that way.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sorry, that was a really dumb statement.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, it's sweet and it's sugar.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, it's not going to be bacon, is it?

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not spamming a can, is it?

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh my God, that is...

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's fumigating the rim.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That is really strong.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The powder does get everywhere.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Bro, the...

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Wait, so it wants this tiny droplet of water?

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Like, there's nothing to it.

142
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's five CCs, it says.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Put one five CC.

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I put all of the powder as my guess.

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, this is the yellow section.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know why you would only put each E sashie in it

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
instead of two sashies.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If you want their English instructions...

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We're going to do this like men.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And do men ask for instructions when needed?

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Men stumble around

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and get to the answer in the end.

155
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They get the job done.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It doesn't have to be 100%,

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
but we're going to do this like men.

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you understand me?

159
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Men, because we're real men.

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We are stumbling around

161
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and we're going to have a good time, okay?

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't even know what I'm making.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please show me a picture, so my brain...

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What?

165
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What?

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I thought I was making something that looked like rays.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, no.

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh!

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm making two biscuit bases

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and I've just put two bases in the water.

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Mmm.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Mmm.

174
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is terrible.

175
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm going to make a poison.

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, yeah, you like that?

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, my God.

178
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Look at that.

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you see that science happening?

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
God, the ring light is absolutely blinding.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hold on.

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ring light, can you...

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Can you turn it down a little bit, too?

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So, you know, you can actually see

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
who you're going to be tonight.

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay, that's close.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's probably as best as I can do.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sorry about the orange hue.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We're in Mexico right now.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Right, so that's the second one.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And then we're going to take our Kawhi Disney spoon

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and we're going to just...

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh.

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Who...

195
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
How science-y.

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We love a woman in STEM, truly.

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This ooh, that is...

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It looks like baby food, but worse somehow.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why is it hydrophobic?

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Can you see how dry that is?

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why is this hydrophobic?

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, it smells like a nice kind of sweet though.

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hold on a minute.

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm not sure how much it gets.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Mommy trying to say,

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Jesse, we need to cook.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Jesse, we're cooking.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We're popping cooking, Jesse.

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, my God, it's like...

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I mean, we can...

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can always add water, but you can't take it out.

213
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So let's give it a good mix before...

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh, yeah.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh, my God.

216
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Cuttlefish can't follow instructions meant for a kid.

217
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Dimo?

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And I'm proud of that.

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How dare you.

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Thank you for your super chat cherry as well.

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yonk, mine too.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Dimo?

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Sometimes you just got to go with the flow.

224
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Life doesn't have to be so structured and rules and...

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, you have to do this.

226
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You have to do that.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sometimes it's okay to just let nature take its course.

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And just because I'm low IQ,

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I accept that nature is taking its course here

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
because what the fuck?

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh, my God, there's so much powder in the corner.

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Surely.

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Right, I'm going to add a droplet of water.

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Truly.

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Mummy colors outside the lines.

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't need no lines to guide me.

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I just let the rotters and take over.

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Bro, there were...

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So Arissa messaged me

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
and I'm not leaking anything for Arissa's debut.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You can't stop me.

242
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If you didn't know Arissa is my shorts editor,

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
she was like...

244
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
She was showing me updates on her model.

245
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm not leaking it.

246
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's cute.

247
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's quite disney though.

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And she was like...

249
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I mean, I would be really nice to play together

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
if you want to play type thing.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And I was like...

252
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you want to do another collab type thing,

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm like,

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Arissa, of course I want to collab with you.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Don't be a silly Billy.

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And she was like,

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
okay, it's just because I don't want to be so forthcoming

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
because of the autism and all that.

259
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And I'm like,

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Arissa, you're my favorite kind of person.

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Because when both parties have autism,

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
you can let...

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, I dropped something.

264
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm not putting that in.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's like...

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll pop it right here

267
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
so you can see it in the corner of the stream

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
so you can see my failures.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay?

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's okay to look in the past,

271
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
but don't dwell on your failures.

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay?

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There's a bit of wisdom.

274
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You can look in the past,

275
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but don't dwell on it.

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't dwell on it.

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay?

278
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But when both parties have autism,

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
it's so fucking easy to communicate

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
because you...

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's no beating around the bush.

282
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There's no...

283
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, hi.

284
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And then like eight billion messages later,

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you finally get the balls to say to each other,

286
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
do you want to collab?

287
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's like,

288
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
hi, do you want to collab?

289
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Here's time.

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Here's game.

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Here's backup game.

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes or no?

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And like...

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Sorry, but...

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There might be some VTubers out there

296
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
who are being like,

297
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
strongy.

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't like the way you ask that.

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And look, I respect it.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Okay?

301
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I respect it.

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But me personally,

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I like no dilly-dallying.

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, I think we've done it.

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You guys okay if I finger this?

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's exactly what's about to happen.

307
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The spoon is cute, but...

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's no way I'm mashing this.

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Okay, we're making the base of the cookies,

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
which is this yellow here.

311
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay.

312
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Straight to the point.

313
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, that's not much.

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay.

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So that's what our thing looks like.

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Would you like to take a bite?

317
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
As you can see,

318
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
the sugar is not mashed in.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It actually has a really nice vanilla thing to it.

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I assume I'm pressing it into this.

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I mean, I don't see why I wouldn't be.

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh wait, maybe take half since I use both sashes.

323
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And then I'm just pressing it in.

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This isn't how it's supposed to be.

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is the only logic I can sense from this.

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Well...

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay, yeah.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No.

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And then just take some of that.

331
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A little bit of this and a little bit of that.

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And just pat it down.

333
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
A little finger and never hurt.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, you know, is this another puzzle game?

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm starting to think it is.

336
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm starting to get a bit nervous.

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a bit shaky.

338
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I mean, if we've got a base, that's all you need to start with.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
As long as it's a flared base, you're good to go.

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Let's stop it.

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Stop making these jokes.

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You don't have to do that every two seconds.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I know, but my brain comes up with it.

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Look, I'm on three hours of sleep.

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Go easy on me.

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Did you see my new short?

347
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's totally pinned in the chat right now.

348
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If I didn't mess it up, it should still be in.

349
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh, sorry.

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was getting distracted.

351
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay, we have our heading.

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And we're going to eat on the plastic

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
because I've not got enough microplastics.

354
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I want macroplastics, motherfucker.

355
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm going to eat these packets by the end of this stream.

356
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay, we have our beloved bases.

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Please come.

358
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's like, oh my God.

359
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm so talented.

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What the fuck?

361
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh my God.

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's an actual love heart.

363
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I love it already.

364
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I understand.

365
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I can just wipe it on the tail.

366
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh my God.

367
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I can just wipe on the tail.

368
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Okay, we've done step yellow.

369
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Now for step red.

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We're to hold on.

371
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What are we supposed to do?

372
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
We are to put red in the top corner

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
and then put it on the little dots.

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Curious.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Curious, but why, why of course?

376
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Huh?

377
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why of course?

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Is that another...

379
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Sorry, there's bits everywhere.

380
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh my gosh, yeah.

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We are learning.

382
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Microplastics are yummy.

383
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you, exactly.

384
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What do you mean microplastics

385
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
can transfer through the umbilical cord

386
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and cause autism when they knew this 20 years ago

387
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
but purposely hid them?

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What?

389
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Are you talking about your silly sausages?

390
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's a little bit too radical of a fact.

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Actually, 20 years ago

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
was the latest published in the Epic Fingers,

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
probably much further back.

394
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Wait, I can't get in.

395
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Gelatin.

396
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Gelatin.

397
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It actually has French on it.

398
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh.

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Well, it has a lot of lingus on it.

400
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hold on a minute.

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Right, so the first one says

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
cookie dough powder in Japanese.

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't ask me how I know that.

404
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh my gosh, I have a buggy.

405
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You want to eat my buggy?

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You want to eat my buggy me?

407
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's the powder, really.

408
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Um...

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Hold on, please.

410
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Cookie dough powder.

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you want to focus again?

412
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm sorry, that was so gross.

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That was such a gross.

414
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Come on.

415
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Come on.

416
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't be shy.

417
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Focus on the word.

418
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh, I just punched the mic.

419
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's not have that.

420
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Go for one.

421
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Come on, focus on the word's webcam.

422
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh!

423
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Paste o kaka?

424
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, hell no, I need this.

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Right.

426
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay, we're putting the red

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
in this little

428
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
kionail.

429
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Little kionail.

430
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, look at this.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh my God.

433
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So Kawaii doesn't need it.

434
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So I am to put

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
the red

436
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
in these little dots.

437
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

438
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's not only Japanese.

439
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Where is my little water?

440
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, I found my water.

441
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, hydration check.

442
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Refluence.

443
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Cheers.

444
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Kampai.

445
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Or cream pie.

446
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, no wait.

447
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Cream pie.

448
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Or kampai.

449
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I can't remember.

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It was a very long time ago.

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
In a far away land.

452
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oh, no.

453
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm missing donuts and stuff.

454
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Sorry.

455
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't see it from here.

456
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Sorry.

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Reverse.

458
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you.

459
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Avcron.

460
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you for the extended time.

461
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Tiny Spiny.

462
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Imagine being hydrophobic.

463
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Like how can you be afraid of water?

464
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Literally just drink it

465
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and then it's gone.

466
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Easy clap.

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Wait until you learn what

468
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
the last stage of rabies is.

469
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Where the kill stage of rabies is.

470
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You're gonna shit.

471
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm gonna shit your pants

472
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
when I teach you real quick

473
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
what the last stage of rabies is.

474
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You develop hydrophobia

475
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and once that happens,

476
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
you're done.

477
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So you're gone.

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Bill's eye.

479
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Ain't nothing you can do.

480
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The rabies one.

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
They've taken over your immune system.

482
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It makes you think that water bad.

483
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But really, water would.

484
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But you can't overcome it.

485
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Don't.

486
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The footage is pretty rough

487
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
if you look up.

488
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Anyway, enough about rabies.

489
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Have it back to

490
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Right.

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It said.

492
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Just wipe that right.

493
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Anyway, you can't see it.

494
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Let me just wipe that.

495
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's actually rather terrifying.

496
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh, sweet, man.

497
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Well, it's not man-made, actually.

498
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh, yeah.

499
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You like that.

500
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The way I stir the spoon.

501
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Oh, this is so sweet.

502
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What?

503
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm very curious

504
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
about what the sugar content

505
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
of any of this is.

506
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Wait, have I put too much water in?

507
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No, this is one.

508
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Am I to leave the droplets?

509
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Oh, is it gelatinous?

510
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And it gelatinizes

511
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
or whatever the

512
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
freaking smart terminology is.

513
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, my gosh, that's so cute.

514
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's it.

515
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm developing a game

516
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and it's just pop and cooking,

517
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
but like a video game of it.

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Because this is so cute.

519
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What the heck?

520
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why do I have so much?

521
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, my God, it's like strawberry jam.

522
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I think that's what it's supposed to be.

523
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, my gosh.

524
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Gently.

525
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Easy.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We have to get it right.

527
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Right, now I did it.

528
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is it just...

529
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I don't...

530
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Well, we're to make matcha.

531
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We'll just move on to the green step

532
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
and leave the red.

533
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So we're to clear this out

534
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
if the best we can.

535
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Sorry, I need to pick my nose again.

536
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you guys want to eat that?

537
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And then we're to put green in the...

538
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
now.

539
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So we're just going to let the jellies gelify.

540
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Are you sure I can't convince you?

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm just saying.

542
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Would you like a green pie?

543
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Thank you, remember?

544
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Okay, this is our failure.

545
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
So we're going to put our failures over there.

546
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That's okay.

547
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Mommy, no.

548
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

549
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Right, next clore.

550
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Choose your clore.

551
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Any clore is green.

552
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Green.

553
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
What?

554
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Why is there a third biscuit that I don't have?

555
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Is that where the chocolate stage is?

556
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
This is the third chocolate.

557
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay, this is where the third one is.

558
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Okay, I was so confused, right?

559
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
We're going to very quickly make the third one

560
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
because I was like, why is it not here?

561
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't understand what step I've missed,

562
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but they've not done it as a step.

563
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
They've included it in the vanilla

564
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and this is chocolate waffle.

565
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay, we're doing it.

566
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We're doing it.

567
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
We're doing it.

568
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's okay.

569
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I figured it out.

570
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Don't pun.

571
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
No pun.

572
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
No pun.

573
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, he's so smart.

574
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Only took me how long to figure it out.

575
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Don't answer that.

576
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Let me do that.

577
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Let me take...

578
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It does gelatinize.

579
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh no, how do I take it out of this?

580
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
How do I...

581
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
How do I take it out of the blender?

582
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Okay, well, it's not quite set yet, but...

583
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Okay, this is when it starts to fall apart.

584
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay, I'm going to taste it.

585
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Are you sure you don't want to taste it first?

586
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
All right.

587
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Well, you don't like my strawberry jam?

588
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Angel, thank you for the super.

589
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I just wanted to say you're super cute and thorg.

590
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's jaffy.

591
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay, very sweet.

592
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Very sweet.

593
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Let me just pop that right there

594
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
for no particular reason.

595
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Just going to wipe off the old sin.

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah.

597
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's popping out right there.

598
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay, now to make our chocolate waffle.

599
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Oh jeez.

600
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
We are making the chocolatine.

601
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh my God, remember that time I taught you guys

602
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
that France is currently having a war with itself

603
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
over if it's called pan au chocolat or chocolatine?

604
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That's right.

605
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So if you want to be controversial...

606
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I don't know.

607
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I can't remember how the fight goes.

608
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think pan au chocolat is like...

609
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
If you want to say it like new,

610
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
but chocolatine is if you want to say it old.

611
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But it's kind of like one of those things where it's like,

612
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
well, it's not a sausage roll.

613
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's a Greek sausage roll, you know?

614
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You know, like those kind of arguments

615
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
that are just so silly and no one gets it.

616
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh my God, this is got chocolate in it.

617
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Cocoa.

618
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Cocoa.

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay.

620
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
This is needing a bit of water.

621
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Damn, the worst start here too, chocolatine.

622
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
That's right.

623
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Even the English know about it.

624
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The English speakers know about the French war going on.

625
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Okay, that was far too much.

626
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm making it work though.

627
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm mixing it up.

628
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What do you mean going back and forth like this isn't mixing it up?

629
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Gonna be burning her.

630
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Do you?

631
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Right, okay, so this is like low key.

632
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So you know when you watch those special videos at night

633
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and whenever it's like not self-made,

634
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
like it's production,

635
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
how is it that the woman's DJ set,

636
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
DJ set can handle this?

637
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
How?

638
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
How is that not burning off?

639
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Please, I must understand.

640
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Do you have any nerves there or are they all gone?

641
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Because how is this occurring?

642
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
How is that even possible?

643
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Netonito, thank you for the membership upgrade.

644
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't, that's a really weird way.

645
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Thank you for the membership.

646
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Enjoy the moment.

647
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
That's the fun part.

648
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
They don't, like that's what my question is.

649
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Because how can you touch the DJ deck?

650
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
These are bunny ears by the way,

651
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
even though it's just the last three fingers of mine going.

652
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
How can the DJ deck be touched

653
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and it just doesn't,

654
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
it just doesn't burn

655
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and it doesn't feel like you want to end it all

656
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
because it's so painful.

657
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Hmm.

658
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Hmm.

659
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Rather strange.

660
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Oh.

661
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh my god, this is so cute.

662
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Okay, I like this part

663
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
because I don't have to do anything for it,

664
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
like it's just happening.

665
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You know, I don't have to think about anything.

666
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's just life's good, okay?

667
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Life is so quiet, isn't it?

668
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I should have cute copyright free background music in right now.

669
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And there's a little like bubble pop on that.

670
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Don't forget to sell everything you own for this drone.

671
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No, no, that's not a thing.

672
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There is a donathon for me coming up

673
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
but you'll understand when you see my goals

674
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
what mine is all about.

675
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But no, do not sell your worldly possessions.

676
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Thank you, Cartofel, for the extended membership.

677
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I see and Merci's emotes have been sent away.

678
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Actually, they're extended.

679
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I love it.

680
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I love it.

681
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Ah!

682
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's so cute.

683
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The Minecraft music.

684
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Callous beans?

685
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What, me?

686
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Because of this?

687
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Because of the way I write with a pencil?

688
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Alright, did I misunderstand?

689
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Four foot on mortal possessions the moment?

690
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
No.

691
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
No, I've had my rage fit.

692
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Right, if you guys want, do you guys want some secret

693
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
YouTube membership stream links?

694
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Grembo understood we mortgage them all for this?

695
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
No.

696
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I screamed at the refunds yesterday for the first time

697
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
in a membership stream.

698
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And you know how much I love my refunds

699
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
but they would not stop giving me money for nothing.

700
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Like, nothing in return.

701
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And I was like,

702
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Okay guys, stop it now.

703
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay guys, guys, you can stop it now.

704
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Guys.

705
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Guys, you can stop.

706
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Stop it, really.

707
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Stop it.

708
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And then I kept going.

709
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And then literally I was like, fucking knock it off.

710
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I can't remember what words I said.

711
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It was probably harsher, like, in my head than it was that

712
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
what came out.

713
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But I was like, save your money.

714
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Save your dang money.

715
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Like, stop giving me your money.

716
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Wait until the donathon.

717
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Jeez.

718
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I still have a Bruce Tentacle mummy thing.

719
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
We shouldn't leak the membership discussion there,

720
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
she does it.

721
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
That's hardly leaking what was inside the donathon goals.

722
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I felt like, yeah, I started screaming at the refunds

723
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
because it wouldn't stop giving me money.

724
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Okay, green stage.

725
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
This is two.

726
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay, wait, is our jelly ready now?

727
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh.

728
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Oh, it's so cute.

729
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's so cute.

730
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The donathon.

731
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Hello, I don't know.

732
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't know.

733
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I'm not the person.

734
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What the fuck?

735
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm a govish.

736
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm a govish.

737
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay, we both have tentacles.

738
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I know.

739
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh my God, this is so cute.

740
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh my God, it's so slippery.

741
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Like, it's so slippery.

742
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Like, oh, it's so nice and slippery.

743
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Rudolph, right now it's reindeer.

744
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Had a very shiny nose.

745
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And if you ever saw it, you would even see it close.

746
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And all the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names.

747
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Perle, old Rudolph.

748
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Goes down in history.

749
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I can't remember the rest of it.

750
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Oh my gosh, this, I love it.

751
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
More.

752
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
More, more, more, more, more.

753
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I also believe, more.

754
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Okay, and then the one that I kinda demolished because I couldn't figure out like a big,

755
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
like a big ogre on how to get out.

756
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This is so cute.

757
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Will you guide my sleight of mind?

758
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Can you tell?

759
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh.

760
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Huh.

761
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Fuck that one up, Chief.

762
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's already gelatinised in the-

763
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
What is gelatinised in the corner?

764
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Mm-hmm.

765
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Well, that was definitely an IQ test part that I failed.

766
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But hey ho, we now have a beautiful rectangle of jelly.

767
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Mm-hmm.

768
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay, right, enough throwing the powder around.

769
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
What does this green stuff-

770
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It says use two water on the green stuff.

771
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And then we can just use like dots and stuff on the green stuff and make what we want.

772
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They make it a lot more kawaii disune on the front.

773
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I mean, like what you got advertised to versus what you receive.

774
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We'll do that after.

775
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Yeah, go let them know you's good story.

776
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Uh, crazy Jessie and we'll do it again.

777
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Thank you for the super chat.

778
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
At least keep your money for the doughnathon so I can have exciting things prepared.

779
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Now if you want to hear about what kind of preparations I've got in place so I can steamroll my goals.

780
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And the girls can attest to this because they have access to the schedule.

781
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I have planned all my streams all the way up to October 12th, which is after the doughnathon.

782
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And the girls can attest to this because they can see it on the schedule.

783
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And I need to add all the membership streams on top.

784
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But I am making sure that I deliver all of the goals like as soon as possible.

785
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Like as soon as I can muster.

786
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What the fuck?

787
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It asks for two water.

788
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Okay, as you are my witness that says two water.

789
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I guess this is just gelatinous one.

790
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's the difference between jelly and jam is that I can't jelly my tentacle into your clam.

791
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You're done.

792
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You're done.

793
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I thought you were actually telling me a fact about the difference between them.

794
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I was going to be like oh that's so cute.

795
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Okay I forgot to clean it so there's a bit of caca just making its way around please.

796
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
No.

797
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh that stinks.

798
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
What is that supposed to be?

799
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Can you smell it and tell me what flavour is that?

800
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh it's fake watermelon.

801
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I love that watermelon.

802
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay we're mixing the watermelon.

803
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And then.

804
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Chloric acid.

805
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Yeah pretty much.

806
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Thank you the beauty lord for the super chat.

807
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh a reflin sent me a message.

808
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm so sorry.

809
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
A reflin was, I'm so sorry if this is you.

810
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
You sent me a super chat or something.

811
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You sent me money and I forgot to say your name twice in a row apparently.

812
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I was very overwhelmed in the member stream.

813
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I do apologise.

814
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I promise I'm not like some nasty hideous ogre.

815
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I was very overwhelmed with all the donations and stuff.

816
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
What the fuck is that consistency?

817
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Is that your ink when you've had too much zinc?

818
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It like, oh this is like, can you hear that?

819
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That's audibly going, that's audibly sponsored by no one.

820
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Okay.

821
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Well it was gonna happen.

822
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Right so the picture has got one half of this waffle green.

823
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So Imma just copy what it does.

824
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh my gosh.

825
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's, oh look at me.

826
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm putting acid in.

827
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I really am the chef and you take the onion and you pat it down on the waffle.

828
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeses.

829
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And what are they done?

830
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
They've done like dots around it as well, around the perimeter.

831
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Right we'll do dots around the perimeter like this one.

832
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I don't know how easy it is to see.

833
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Do you have my full screen or am I on a phone for you?

834
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
How big am I to you right now?

835
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Am I full screen?

836
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Be honest.

837
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You're inking on my cookie, inking on my cookies like you wanted me.

838
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Honestly all the time.

839
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay dot, dot, oh dot, dot.

840
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
That's not happening.

841
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It's getting rather gelatinous fast.

842
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Please, please stop reacting so quickly.

843
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I don't have to, we're on a timer.

844
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Okay dot, dot, and a dot on the bottom.

845
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Okay, all done.

846
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That was the green.

847
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
We have lots of green left over.

848
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And then we have last and certainly not least purple,

849
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
which were to put in the cheese slice bag,

850
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
one water of purple, put it in the bag and then cut the corner of the bag.

851
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then there's a square of jelly.

852
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh, the jelly is supposed to become a rectangle.

853
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Okay, we're to put it in the cheese slice.

854
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I do love me a cheese slice.

855
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Are these edible?

856
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Do you want me to put it in my mouth?

857
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I could put it in my mouth.

858
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I can't promise I'm going to swallow, but I could put it in.

859
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I would be rather nervous too.

860
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Okay, right, cheese slice as you are my witness, cheese slice.

861
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm just listening at work.

862
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Okay, rather powdery.

863
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
A bit more, bit more.

864
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Spitters or quivers.

865
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
It's edible, sure.

866
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If it's not edible, no, let's not.

867
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Okay, we need one more.

868
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Okay.

869
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It says to mix it in the pot, but what's the point in doing that?

870
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm just going to mix it in the bag.

871
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Okay, easy.

872
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We've got a one-handed operation going, okay?

873
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Like, you say you watch my streams one-handed all the time.

874
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Ooh, why did that wobble like that?

875
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
You're making me nervous.

876
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Are these edible in the first place?

877
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Yes, they're supposed to be...

878
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Pop and Cookin' is supposed to be edible sweets that you, like, finish making.

879
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's supposed to be, like, a wee thing for wanes, I think.

880
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I mean, I do have the brain like you have a wane.

881
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay, so we just put it in the bag.

882
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And then we just swirl it around.

883
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's specifically said to, like...

884
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't know, I was just going to shake it up like that.

885
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Well...

886
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Why does this look like SPH same?

887
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
No, it kind of does, though.

888
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But I'm shuggling it up. I'm shuggling and wiggling.

889
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Look, I'm squeezing, I'm squeezing.

890
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Pop and Cookin'.

891
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
What kind of shake is that?

892
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Well, I don't know what it, like, violently is.

893
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Like, you could shake it like this, I guess.

894
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, we can give it inertia.

895
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay, let's do it. Let's give it some G-force.

896
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
G-force. Oh, yeah.

897
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Give it some science, baby.

898
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Hit him with the physics.

899
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Okay, are you mixed up now?

900
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It looks like a...

901
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I just...

902
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
POV, you hire me to pinch and roll for you.

903
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
There you go. Is that better?

904
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah, it's the itching stops.

905
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Give it a little pinch and roll, yeah.

906
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Okay, a little pinch and roll.

907
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
There you go. There you go.

908
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
A little cheeky pinch and roll.

909
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah, that'll do it.

910
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
That'll do it, Bunky, a little bit.

911
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Congrats on 23,000 subscribers.

912
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Did I actually hit that milestone?

913
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
As normally, I am nervous hitting a milestone,

914
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
but I have so much ASMR coming out, I'm not nervous.

915
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm like, bring it on, motherfucker.

916
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Thank you so much, everyone.

917
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Thank you, Reflings.

918
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
The milking farm is going to get rather large.

919
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I did not anticipate so many weekends.

920
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Right, let's cut the corner

921
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
faster than later.

922
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Okay, so they've done, like, purple dots and hearts.

923
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
They've put the purple in between the waffle

924
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
thingy-ma-bob.

925
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Okay, I can do that.

926
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm going to remove our little jelly hearts

927
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and then I'm going to roll this.

928
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, wait, how did they do it on the back?

929
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
They said tie a knot on it.

930
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Nah, I can't be harsh, but thanks.

931
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
You take them in and you take the sun.

932
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I'm so sorry, I don't know what sun that is.

933
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I thought we were singing Christmas carols.

934
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Right, this is...

935
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Oh, that was rather a large incision.

936
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay, we just need to very gently...

937
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Thank you, the tongue...

938
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Super chill.

939
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Oh!

940
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Skills.

941
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I'm a surgeon.

942
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I am a surgeon.

943
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Now, the heart didn't really perfect itself

944
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
at the top and the bottom, so I can't really...

945
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

946
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, there's a little extra leakage,

947
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
but that's perfectly normal, please don't...

948
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Okay, and then...

949
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
What, they did love hearts on the green here?

950
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
How do you draw?

951
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
That's too intricate to draw a love heart.

952
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's just a dot.

953
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Hi Jane, I tried to draw a love heart.

954
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
That's just a dot.

955
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Hold on, can I just move you at the bottom there?

956
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Okay, that's good, just a little tap there.

957
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Thank you, Athenae, for the extended membership.

958
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Justine, hi, while I'm studying, it looks tasty.

959
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You'd eat the...

960
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Do you want to die?

961
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Do you want to meet your maker?

962
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What?

963
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
How did they make a love heart?

964
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Did they use the spoon?

965
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Maybe.

966
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I will design a love heart.

967
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Oh, we've got a bit of shapeage going on.

968
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Hold on a minute, don't write me out just yet.

969
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Put me back in, coach.

970
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Put me back in, and then if I artificially extend the top part up here...

971
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, that's a triangle.

972
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's what that is, love.

973
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's a triangle.

974
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Okay, I've made a triangle.

975
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There you go.

976
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It's a freaking triangle.

977
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm just wanting the cute little love heart.

978
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Love heart, geez.

979
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Fine, you're getting dots on the rest of...

980
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Oh, that's not even a dot.

981
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Please, dot.

982
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Dot.

983
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And then the finishing touches.

984
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's a triangle.

985
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, triangle.

986
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Hydration check.

987
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Draw a tentacle.

988
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Why would I draw one when I'm already repping the merch?

989
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That's right.

990
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Strony at Oogoo Market.

991
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Or if you prefer my gen mates, they also get 100% as well,

992
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
because we all don't take a cut like that.

993
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Oh, actually, I got...

994
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Where's the sprinkles?

995
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Oh, the sprinkles is just on it.

996
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I got a marshmallow and it was like,

997
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I bet you're so mad that you don't take a fansly cut.

998
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And I'm like, motherfucker, you know,

999
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
we have terrible news for you.

1000
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We never specified it.

1001
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't expect the girls to do it.

1002
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I don't expect any future girls to do it.

1003
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Of course, they can reap 100% of the...

1004
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh my gosh, there's a love heart in here.

1005
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And it's green reeflings.

1006
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's literally us.

1007
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Oh, shh.

1008
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You didn't see me throw the sprinkles everywhere.

1009
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's literally us because it's green.

1010
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's so cute.

1011
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Do I taste it?

1012
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Do I smell it?

1013
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Mmm, smells mass produced.

1014
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I might just sprinkle all this shit everywhere.

1015
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1016
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And then the last finishing touches.

1017
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Boop.

1018
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And...

1019
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Boop.

1020
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Now, reeflings.

1021
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I'm going to put it on our triangle heart

1022
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
because that's where it belongs.

1023
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Reeflings, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes

1024
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
temporarily, okay?

1025
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I try to close your eyes.

1026
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I wish there was a close-eyes emote,

1027
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
but I don't really have that.

1028
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Okay, so you have been advertised

1029
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
to come to the new Veiler exclusive cafe.

1030
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Oh, let me get the cooking instructions out of the way.

1031
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
You've been...

1032
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh, we got raided.

1033
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Thank you so much.

1034
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Hi, raiders.

1035
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I'm so sorry.

1036
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The freaking notifications are so broken.

1037
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It didn't even pop up saying I was raided.

1038
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Thank you so much for raiding.

1039
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Who did it?

1040
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Own up to it.

1041
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Own up to who raided me right now.

1042
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Own up.

1043
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Oh, I just realized that I have a five-minute subscriber-only modon.

1044
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I have...

1045
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
It was Kendra.

1046
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Thank you, Kendra, for the raid.

1047
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Thank you.

1048
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Thank you.

1049
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Thank you very much.

1050
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Hi, I'm Strawny.

1051
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm wildly inappropriate from Veiler.

1052
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You'll probably prefer my gen mates.

1053
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Check them out in the description below.

1054
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
We're currently doing pop and cooking.

1055
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So you've entered the Veiler cafe.

1056
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You've ordered off the menu three waffles,

1057
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
one chocolate, two vanilla.

1058
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
It looks delicious.

1059
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
All you hear in the background is pots and pans banging.

1060
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm swearing in Scottish.

1061
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Amy's popping off in Canadian.

1062
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Merci.

1063
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
She's spitting a bit of Vietnamese.

1064
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't know what's going on.

1065
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
She's just having a good time back there.

1066
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Shibi and Azura are bickering over something.

1067
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And Aisy with her paws can hardly pick anything up.

1068
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So that's what's going on in the background.

1069
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And you think to yourself,

1070
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm sure this is going to be fine.

1071
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Surely.

1072
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
They've got this cracked down.

1073
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's just three basic waffles.

1074
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And then you hear the door open.

1075
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The music starts playing.

1076
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And you hear all six of us in unison.

1077
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Ah, master.

1078
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Your waffles are ready.

1079
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Okay.

1080
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
And then we say, master,

1081
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
please close your eyes for the reveal of the delicious food.

1082
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Master.

1083
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And then you close your eyes,

1084
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
which you're doing now.

1085
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Your eyes are closed.

1086
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And then you open your eyes

1087
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
to the delicious plate.

1088
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh, my God.

1089
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That is foul.

1090
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That is foul.

1091
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And you think to yourself,

1092
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
open the cafe.

1093
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
You think to yourself,

1094
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
damn, these girls really are a girl feel.

1095
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Yeah.

1096
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And then,

1097
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and then as we walk away back into the kitchen,

1098
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Squidward walking sound effects and all,

1099
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
you quickly grab the menu

1100
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
just to revise over what you ordered.

1101
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And you say to yourself,

1102
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
no, I'm not going crazy.

1103
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And then you check.

1104
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Oh.

1105
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
That is disgusting.

1106
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Anyway.

1107
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
And that's why they were arguing in the back.

1108
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yes.

1109
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
We were arguing if we should serve it to you or not,

1110
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
but we ended up serving it to you.

1111
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
It's an actual war crime.

1112
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
No.

1113
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'll eat it.

1114
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
You're not going to make it out on the other side if you eat this.

1115
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Thanks for the water.

1116
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
What?

1117
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Thanks for the waffle.

1118
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It looks even better than advertised.

1119
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
That is concrete.

1120
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
That is,

1121
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
that is one schemas.

1122
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And how much,

1123
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
so we paid $9.95 to get it into the cafe.

1124
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Do you know how much we upcharged you?

1125
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
$15 for this.

1126
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You've been upcharged $5.05.

1127
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
How does it make you feel?

1128
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Does it make you want to correct us?

1129
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Oh, dear.

1130
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Oh, no.

1131
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
You should totally not correct the valour girls.

1132
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Well, hey.

1133
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Oh, no.

1134
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
What a punishment.

1135
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Thank you to Tonethay for the super chat.

1136
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Oh, yeah.

1137
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The brat cafe?

1138
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I mean, I will order as a maid outfits right now.

1139
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'll get everyone to do one pop and cooking stream.

1140
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And then,

1141
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
okay, I'm going to put it in my mouth.

1142
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Eenie meenie meenie mo.

1143
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Catch the tiger by the toe.

1144
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
If it squeals, let it go.

1145
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Eenie meenie meenie mo.

1146
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Okay.

1147
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Okay.

1148
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
We're doing it.

1149
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh, no.

1150
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay.

1151
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Right.

1152
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
To continue the story,

1153
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
you ask,

1154
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
you ask strongy to come over to the,

1155
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
your table and you say,

1156
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
excuse me strongy,

1157
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
this isn't quite advertised.

1158
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Are you sure it's edible?

1159
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And I say to you,

1160
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
of course it's edible.

1161
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Don't be silly.

1162
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You don't trust me.

1163
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Look,

1164
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I'll eat it right in front of you, master.

1165
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I'm so scared to bite into this.

1166
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
But you see the nervous look on my face,

1167
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
knowing full well this is not edible

1168
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
in any degree.

1169
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Did I put the whole thing in my mouth?

1170
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Hmm.

1171
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Yeah, why not?

1172
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
What are you talking about?

1173
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It's completely edible.

1174
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Here, have a bite.

1175
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Here's your,

1176
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
your half eaten waffle back to you,

1177
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
covered in my spit.

1178
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Oh, hold on.

1179
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
That's why having a towel down is the best thing.

1180
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
You just spit right on the towel.

1181
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
That is veil.

1182
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Don't recommend.

1183
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Nope.

1184
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And it's still stuck on my lips.

1185
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Oh, it's making me salivate,

1186
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
but not the good kind.

1187
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Hold on.

1188
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Let me,

1189
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
let me just,

1190
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
bleh.

1191
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
My spit is literally tainted pink.

1192
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
That's how much like,

1193
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
like sugary stuff and all that.

1194
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's that bad.

1195
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
The reaction was so quick.

1196
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That was terrifying.

1197
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Anyway,

1198
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I hand you back your ordered waffles.

1199
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Here you go, master.

1200
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Please enjoy.

1201
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And thank you for paying

1202
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
before seeing the product.

1203
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I place it down on the table

1204
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and walk away in embarrassment.

1205
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And let's just say you were the last customer

1206
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
at the cafe before it shut down.

1207
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
That is,

1208
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
that is my vealer cafe opening story.

1209
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
It looks like mush.

1210
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yes.

1211
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I mean,

1212
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
everything is like,

1213
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
it's like all good fun.

1214
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
What do you mean you don't want the

1215
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
heat up,

1216
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
reefing,

1217
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
here master,

1218
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
enjoy.

1219
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Wait,

1220
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
what do you mean you don't trust my cooking?

1221
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Look at the spoon.

1222
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I cooked this myself.

1223
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You did better than Emmy.

1224
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Emmys didn't go that badly, did it?

1225
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But that's their ink.

1226
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay.

1227
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I won't make you eat your ink.

1228
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Only in a later audio.

1229
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Look,

1230
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
no, I don't care.

1231
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I don't care if you think it's weird.

1232
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I like it.

1233
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Whoa,

1234
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
it's so perfectly round.

1235
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I want to play with it.

1236
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Oh,

1237
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
the corners are round.

1238
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
See,

1239
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
look,

1240
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
we did make it in-house.

1241
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
You thought we ordered this product

1242
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
and it was,

1243
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
it wasn't,

1244
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
like,

1245
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
stored well?

1246
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Oh,

1247
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
that's so satisfying to touch.

1248
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Oh,

1249
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I could play with this

1250
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
for a little while.

1251
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Yeah,

1252
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I like that.

1253
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yeah,

1254
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
yeah,

1255
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
you do,

1256
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
yeah,

1257
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
you like that shit,

1258
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
don't you?

1259
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
What do you mean master,

1260
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you're going to report us?

1261
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
No,

1262
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
no,

1263
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
no,

1264
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
no,

1265
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
no,

1266
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
don't do that.

1267
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Shh,

1268
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
don't do that,

1269
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
master.

1270
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Fond de la Gelo,

1271
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
oh,

1272
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
no,

1273
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
that's even worse.

1274
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
If

1275
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Azura ever gets drawn as a slime,

1276
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
whoever commissions that,

1277
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
call it Fond de la Gelo.

1278
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
That's all I'm saying.

1279
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
This cafe is not OSHA certified.

1280
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Wait,

1281
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
use it for ASMR.

1282
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I'm not putting this

1283
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
on my microphone.

1284
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
See,

1285
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that's a wrong,

1286
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
this side,

1287
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
satisfaction,

1288
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
look at the corners.

1289
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
How could you go around?

1290
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
That's so good.

1291
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You can see how

1292
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
wet it's making my hands.

1293
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Mm,

1294
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
but you see,

1295
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
like all the glue,

1296
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
but,

1297
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
you don't like my hat,

1298
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
you don't like...

1299
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Eek!

1300
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Eek!

1301
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
That's what I think about you

1302
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
popping,

1303
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
cooking.

1304
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Oh,

1305
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
that does not feel nice

1306
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
when it's like this though.

1307
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Mm.

1308
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Oh my God,

1309
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
it's making

1310
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
really squelchy noises.

1311
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Look,

1312
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
all I'm saying is,

1313
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
if you have pop and cooking at home

1314
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
and you don't want to eat it,

1315
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
you can 100%

1316
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
just

1317
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
make some ASMR with it.

1318
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Uh,

1319
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
oh wait,

1320
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I keep forgetting,

1321
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I literally put a towel

1322
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
to do this.

1323
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That's,

1324
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
that's literally why

1325
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I brought a towel through.

1326
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So I can just do this,

1327
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
and I don't have to like,

1328
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
baller about cleaning my hands

1329
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
every two seconds.

1330
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Look,

1331
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
see,

1332
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
we can literally do it together.

1333
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Mm.

1334
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Did you know that

1335
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
when you wash your hands,

1336
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
do you want to know

1337
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
what the most forgotten part

1338
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
of your hand is?

1339
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
When you wash it,

1340
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
it's this section.

1341
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah.

1342
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
When you wash your hands,

1343
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
this is the most forgotten section

1344
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
that harbours the bacteria

1345
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
because everyone

1346
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
forgores.

1347
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And uh,

1348
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
yeah.

1349
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Also got some kitchen roll.

1350
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It's Johnny a dirty girl.

1351
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
All right,

1352
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
my fourth year.

1353
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
What?

1354
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It's ketchup season yet?

1355
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
No, it's not.

1356
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Fingernail.

1357
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Wrist.

1358
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
No, don't look at my wrist.

1359
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Look at the wrist.

1360
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Hey,

1361
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
never look in that part again.

1362
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I mean, we did it.

1363
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
No,

1364
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
we do have another one.

1365
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I'm not doing it

1366
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
because

1367
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
that was just too much.

1368
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I did not expect any of that.

1369
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
That was too hard.

1370
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
So I'm just going to ramble.

1371
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Is she becoming on?

1372
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Oh my God.

1373
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Oh, I didn't even realize

1374
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
it's not even being an MRG.

1375
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Damn.

1376
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Really short stream for me.

1377
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I don't think I've ever had

1378
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
such a short.

1379
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh, no, I have Lego Lord of the Rings

1380
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
part three

1381
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
because,

1382
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
well, yeah.

1383
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Oh God,

1384
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
the second cooking set.

1385
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
No, I need to clean.

1386
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So basically what I need to do,

1387
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I need to clean all this up

1388
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
and put it in the washing machine

1389
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and put,

1390
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
like,

1391
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
in the,

1392
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
we will,

1393
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
we will,

1394
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I'll give it to the birds, okay?

1395
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
The birds will eat.

1396
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I'm not even feeding that

1397
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
to the birds.

1398
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
No, sure.

1399
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
I ain't feeding them poison.

1400
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I'm more than happy

1401
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
to just look at you ramble.

1402
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Not the bee.

1403
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
We're blanks.

1404
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Huh?

1405
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You're going to torture them?

1406
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
No, no.

1407
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I fed the birds

1408
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
a cheese and ham quathons.

1409
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
This sounds really dumb,

1410
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
but I forgot how buttery

1411
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
quathons are.

1412
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
You know how quathons

1413
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
are known for

1414
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
being really buttery

1415
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and flaky

1416
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and baked in a buttery,

1417
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
flaky crust?

1418
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So there's a second

1419
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
poppin' kick in.

1420
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Don't,

1421
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
that's terrible.

1422
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Don't underlive those magpies.

1423
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Never cook again.

1424
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
This was not it.

1425
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Quathons are like 90% butter.

1426
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Literally,

1427
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
so I don't mind butter,

1428
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
but I don't exactly love it.

1429
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Have a memory of my gran

1430
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
feeding me

1431
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
supper

1432
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and supper

1433
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
was just bread and butter,

1434
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
alright?

1435
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But the butter was so caked on

1436
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
that when I took a bite,

1437
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
you could see my teeth

1438
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
in dense in the butter

1439
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
and that is my,

1440
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
whenever I think of butter,

1441
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
that's all I think about.

1442
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And I remember forcing myself

1443
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
to eat it

1444
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
and trying not to like upset her

1445
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
because she'd made me

1446
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
my supper,

1447
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
like because I was having

1448
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
a sleepover with her

1449
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and that's all I remember.

1450
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
That's all I think about

1451
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
with butter.

1452
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
It was so buttery

1453
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
that my teeth marks

1454
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
were left in the butter.

1455
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That's how much butter

1456
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
was on that bread.

1457
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Classic British supper,

1458
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
literally

1459
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
a bit of salt

1460
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
on the bread.

1461
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Butter and a bit of salt

1462
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
and that was supper.

1463
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
That was supper to keep me

1464
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
going until morning

1465
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
after my sleepover

1466
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
with my gran.

1467
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The French will remember

1468
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
that stuff.

1469
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Stop, you made me

1470
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
drop my croissant.

1471
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I don't have anything

1472
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
interesting to show you

1473
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
other than that though.

1474
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm afraid this is like,

1475
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I ain't that

1476
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
interesting of a person.

1477
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I ain't got anything to show.

1478
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Unless you want me to

1479
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,000
roll play with the key chains,

1480
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I can do that.

1481
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Wherever they are,

1482
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
they are in this room.

1483
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Or I can do a little

1484
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
dance for you.

1485
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Okay, no, seriously,

1486
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
where are the key chains?

1487
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh, there they are.

1488
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I found them.

1489
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I found them.

1490
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
They're under all my

1491
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
ASMR stuff.

1492
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Okay.

1493
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
We do

1494
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
a little bit of chilling

1495
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
and then

1496
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'll wrap it up

1497
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
as a short stream

1498
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
just because I have had

1499
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
three original

1500
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
hours of sleep.

1501
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And I'm not wet.

1502
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's shielded.

1503
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
So I'm going to make

1504
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
an ASMR video soon to you.

1505
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I actually

1506
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
maybe could do it

1507
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
within this week.

1508
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Let's not put them

1509
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
on the sticky.

1510
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Let's be a bit nicer

1511
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
to my gen mates.

1512
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Okay, they worked a little

1513
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
too hard to be put on

1514
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
sticky towels

1515
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
from our maid cafe

1516
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
experience.

1517
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Doesn't look.

1518
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So what I'm going to do

1519
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
is just like a basic

1520
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
ASMR.

1521
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm going to have my fake nails

1522
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
on.

1523
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Actually, I have a different

1524
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
fake nails set on

1525
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
for when I record this video.

1526
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Let me grab it for you.

1527
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So this...

1528
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Oh, that's absolutely

1529
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
there's nothing in there.

1530
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Hold on.

1531
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
This is it.

1532
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh, and this is the

1533
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
shock collar

1534
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
that wants my

1535
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
my phone number

1536
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
to activate.

1537
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I offered the girls

1538
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
it for free if they wanted

1539
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
it.

1540
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But no one took me up

1541
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
on the offer.

1542
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
And they were probably like

1543
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
strong.

1544
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
He's fucking crazy

1545
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
because I was like,

1546
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
hey girls,

1547
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
it takes your tracking data

1548
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
and your phone number

1549
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
and your location

1550
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and most likely opens up

1551
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
like your phone book

1552
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and grabs all your contacts.

1553
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But you can have it

1554
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
if you want it.

1555
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And no one took me up

1556
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
on that offer.

1557
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
But they're probably like

1558
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
strong.

1559
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
He's fucking mental.

1560
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And it's like, you know what?

1561
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Maybe I'm maybe I'm

1562
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
but yeah,

1563
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
this is the nail set.

1564
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This is the other nail set

1565
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I got.

1566
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Look.

1567
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh my God.

1568
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
There's no way.

1569
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1570
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Hey, hey, hey.

1571
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But I was going to wear

1572
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
these fake nails

1573
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
and then I was going to

1574
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
tap all the girls' faces.

1575
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I really like

1576
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
this brand.

1577
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
No, I know.

1578
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Hold on.

1579
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I know audience's mail.

1580
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
All I'm saying.

1581
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Narcissist Nails.

1582
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Nails Assist.

1583
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Good brand.

1584
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I thoroughly enjoy them.

1585
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I'm probably going to buy

1586
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
more stuff off their website.

1587
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm not even kidding.

1588
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I thoroughly,

1589
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
thoroughly 10 out of 10

1590
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
experience.

1591
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But we've got mercy

1592
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
and then we're going to

1593
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
touch mercy and tap.

1594
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So it's basically tapping

1595
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
ASMR as the video

1596
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
that I'm going to record.

1597
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I'm going to be recording

1598
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
and literally I'm just

1599
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
going to tap over.

1600
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
There's going to be no talking

1601
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
because I don't really see

1602
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
why I would talk through this.

1603
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Oh, my voice is going out.

1604
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I've not had enough rest.

1605
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But mercy on the nose.

1606
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But yeah,

1607
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Kohai is back.

1608
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Kohai is back.

1609
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
And then we've got sheeps.

1610
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Now she's the wrong color.

1611
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And I've white washed her.

1612
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Oh, dear.

1613
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Whoopsies.

1614
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Her merchandise is the wrong color.

1615
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
And then we've got

1616
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Aysical.

1617
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The sleepy head.

1618
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
This is actually her toggle as well.

1619
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Oops, sorry.

1620
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I just bumped him.

1621
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I could hear that.

1622
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Her toggle has little snowflakes

1623
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and bubble pops,

1624
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
but she's sleepy.

1625
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
She got insomnia.

1626
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
She's got insomnia.

1627
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
And that's a little Aysical.

1628
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And the person who made the,

1629
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
how you call them,

1630
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
the artworks were really good

1631
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
because I was like,

1632
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
at the time I was like,

1633
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
please do the pupils correct.

1634
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
We don't have normal pupils.

1635
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Do not send me back artwork

1636
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
with normal pupils

1637
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
because every time I sent away

1638
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
an artwork of the girls,

1639
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
they would send me pupils normal.

1640
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And I'm like,

1641
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
please look at the reference sheet I have.

1642
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
None of us have normal pupils.

1643
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Do not send me a fucking dot back.

1644
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I am sick of it.

1645
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Amy, she came out so mischievous.

1646
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Like, literally so, so mischievous.

1647
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Like, come on.

1648
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Look at the intention on her face.

1649
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Look at it.

1650
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Would you just look at it?

1651
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I'm so proud of you.

1652
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But yeah, they aced her design.

1653
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
There's actually some hidden lore

1654
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
about her book.

1655
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You know how Amy updated her design a little bit?

1656
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
The book originally has a face on it

1657
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
to show how evil the book was,

1658
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
but it got taken out at some point during the lore

1659
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and then we ended up taking it out in the design.

1660
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
But we've added it back in thanks to Amy's abilities

1661
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
to fucking edit the,

1662
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
the thingy mobile.

1663
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
The smug aura of this keychain

1664
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
is mocking me.

1665
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And then there's a sort of just pure

1666
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
literally, it's just so good.

1667
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Sorry.

1668
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Sorry to be, we, sorry for unity.

1669
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Sorry, I can't help it.

1670
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Love, love me a bit of unity.

1671
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Love me a bit of unity.

1672
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Oh my god, there she is.

1673
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Look at her.

1674
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So yeah, if you see me in public with six keychains,

1675
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
click clackin'.

1676
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Literally, if this is all you hear outside,

1677
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and you see all of this,

1678
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and this is on the end of a key,

1679
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
yeah, it's me.

1680
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Okay, I don't care.

1681
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I'm proud.

1682
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I'm sorry, I do.

1683
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I'm biased.

1684
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I don't care what you,

1685
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I don't care what you say.

1686
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
But that's me.

1687
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I have to admit,

1688
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Chibi's work so well with my design.

1689
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Like, Chibi's work fantastically well with my design.

1690
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Sorry, I said it, I'm biased.

1691
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm biased.

1692
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
But look how adorable I am.

1693
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Please focus.

1694
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Focus.

1695
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
You better focus on me.

1696
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You know what?

1697
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I'm doing the influencer hand thing.

1698
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
So yeah, there we go.

1699
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I forced the focus.

1700
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I just, sorry.

1701
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Chibi is just so complimentary.

1702
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
What is unity?

1703
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Unity is a terminology for when,

1704
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
it could be a gen.

1705
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Maybe it's a full agency.

1706
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You guys might know better than me.

1707
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Unity means that I like fully give my all

1708
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
in terms of like, I love everyone equally.

1709
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And I don't know,

1710
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
you guys would define it better than me.

1711
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It just means I love all my girls.

1712
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
To me, that's what unity means.

1713
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I love them.

1714
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
But you guys probably have a better definition.

1715
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Unity, it's a game development.

1716
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Reflang, no.

1717
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Unity, well, you're not wrong.

1718
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
But unity means like, I love all my gen mates

1719
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
and surely that's what it means.

1720
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I mean, you love your girls equally with no favoritism.

1721
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Fuck yeah, I demand unity.

1722
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I demand it.

1723
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I demand unity.

1724
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I kneel.

1725
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I can't kneel any harder.

1726
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I'm demanding so much unity right now.

1727
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
At least even more cut offish like a Chibi

1728
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
because of the bigger head.

1729
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
So, I mean, you can kind of see the hidden design elements.

1730
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I think I've spoken about my design before.

1731
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
The hidden element is my hair comes out

1732
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
like the side of a cephalopod.

1733
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
My bangs as well also do that.

1734
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
You see the out-of-sidey pointy bits of my hair.

1735
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
That's to mimic a cephalopod.

1736
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
And then the bottom of my feet as well.

1737
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Obviously you won't be able to see it in the Chibi design.

1738
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
But the bottom of my feet are the body shape

1739
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
of a cephalopod as well.

1740
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And then my yukata is a homage to Japanese culture

1741
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
because would we be here without it?

1742
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Made up a definition.

1743
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
How dare you?

1744
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,000
How dare you?

1745
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I remember being more insulted in my life.

1746
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Show us with your model.

1747
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I mean...

1748
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We're gonna...

1749
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The tracking is gonna get lost

1750
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
because the tracking's on the floor, okay?

1751
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Oh, I did not mean that.

1752
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Oh no.

1753
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Oh no, you can see my heart.

1754
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
You can see my soul.

1755
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I remember learning that Americans

1756
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
apparently get bullied for washing their clothes.

1757
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
You see the design of the tape around my legs?

1758
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That's the cephalopod.

1759
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And then that's my eyes.

1760
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
And then that's me.

1761
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You're dead.

1762
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Nothing.

1763
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Nothing?

1764
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Nothing.

1765
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Wait, sorry, the tracking is on the floor right now.

1766
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I had to basically move all of my setup from desk

1767
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
as you see my hands in the shadows from desk

1768
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
to floor.

1769
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Not easy.

1770
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
No, no, not quick.

1771
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's why it took me so long to pop up.

1772
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I didn't even have time to be like,

1773
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
oh my god, give me a minute.

1774
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I was like...

1775
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Like, there's currently...

1776
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
You're sitting on a tripod.

1777
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
The microphone is in the air.

1778
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You know, that I can do that with.

1779
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
The lighting source, my ring light and my tracking

1780
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
is over here.

1781
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And then you know, I had to set this up.

1782
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I had to put it all there.

1783
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I mean, I literally went and ran and got bowls

1784
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
because I was like, I think I need a...

1785
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Oh, you can see Gimli's cat here in the bowl.

1786
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I was like, I think I need a bowl for this stream.

1787
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I don't know why.

1788
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Maybe I need a bowl to mix stuff up in.

1789
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
It was not good.

1790
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I was like, oh look, it's my hair.

1791
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It's getting longer.

1792
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Don't worry, my hair grew back after cutting it

1793
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
for Mercy.

1794
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It comes back, I promise.

1795
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
But yes, so this was very hard,

1796
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
but I'm going to do a membership ASMR

1797
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
and real life camera thing in my bobber.

1798
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Not my face or my body.

1799
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I'm literally going to take all this away

1800
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
and clean it up.

1801
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And then I'm going to put the 3Dial here

1802
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
and then you can watch me as I actually do.

1803
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But yeah!

1804
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
That's it, I don't have anything else

1805
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
exciting to show, I'm afraid.

1806
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I'm probably going to be

1807
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
ballsy and contact

1808
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
a company in Japan

1809
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
that specializes in unique figurines

1810
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
for the girls.

1811
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm going to see if they're willing to work with us.

1812
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Because I think,

1813
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I think now that we've all surpassed

1814
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
10k subscribers

1815
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
that they

1816
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
would be willing.

1817
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
But I need to see what the...

1818
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I don't want the girls to be wasting their time

1819
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
promoting something

1820
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
if they're not getting a good cut.

1821
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
If that means I have to forego my cut

1822
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
then, you know, so be it.

1823
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Did you show your schedule?

1824
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh no I didn't!

1825
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Hold on, let me get my schedule.

1826
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Don't look at my feet.

1827
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What, what do you mean?

1828
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Don't look at my feet, make sure I'm holding it.

1829
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh no.

1830
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Oh no, my ankle.

1831
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Oh, my ankle.

1832
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Oh no.

1833
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Okay, hold on, let me start,

1834
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
let me show my schedule.

1835
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Shimmy shimmy shimmy shimmy shimmy

1836
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
yaha

1837
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
wa da da da

1838
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Hold on, I'm getting my schedule.

1839
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I'm getting my schedule.

1840
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I had to cover up the artwork.

1841
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Now, before I know

1842
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
get the point is, one relax.

1843
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So, I'm trying my best, okay?

1844
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
There we go.

1845
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Okay, I'm going to cover up my face

1846
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
because my tracking is going to be off

1847
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
because I'm up here.

1848
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
But we're going to see if we can

1849
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
100% complete

1850
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Sonic Heroes

1851
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Sonic Heroes

1852
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
And then we're going to finish

1853
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
all of Vermintay 2 stream sniping

1854
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I'm purposely doing on

1855
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
a week day for the stream snip

1856
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
because I don't want anyone

1857
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
who worked weekends to completely miss out

1858
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So, we're going to finish all of Vermintay

1859
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
We're going to play a game called Tavern Master

1860
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
It looks like

1861
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It looks like

1862
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
a game that I can pretend

1863
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
that we're in Hobbiton

1864
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and we're trying to run a tavern

1865
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
just outside of Bree

1866
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
So, I'm going to be role playing

1867
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I don't care, I love it

1868
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I'm going to give it a shot

1869
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
It looks cute

1870
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
And then we're going to do

1871
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
a member script right in stream

1872
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
which is really just me

1873
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
disguising my work as content

1874
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
So, yeah

1875
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
If you want to watch me work

1876
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
and come up with a script

1877
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
We're playing the Black Ops 1 campaign

1878
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Fantastic

1879
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Juicy

1880
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Lekker

1881
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Lekkerding

1882
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Very Lekkerding

1883
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
It's a gorgeous game

1884
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I think it's about a 7 to 8 hour campaign

1885
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It is quite a big campaign

1886
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
especially for an older Call of Duty

1887
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Then

1888
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
we're going to finalise Peggle as well

1889
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I think we've got about half way through it

1890
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
So, there's probably only 2 hours to go on Peggle

1891
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And then we're going to do

1892
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Members Ballotro

1893
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I just want to chill out

1894
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
and I'm testing the waters

1895
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
with Members

1896
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
the gaming content

1897
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Like, I've done Ballotro a lot

1898
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
and I've not played it

1899
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
since the last time I played it on stream

1900
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
and we're going to test it

1901
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
If it's good, it's good

1902
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
If it's bad, it's bad

1903
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
But, you know, thank you as always

1904
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
for letting me experience

1905
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
for the first time

1906
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Golfit is the collab

1907
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
We are going to be streaming it

1908
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
but we're all going to redirect into Zura

1909
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
on Saturday because it has

1910
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
her 12 hour donathon

1911
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
There will be

1912
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
graphics released very, very soon

1913
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Mommy's going to lose the house

1914
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
to get washroom with Gambo

1915
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
You can Peggle me any day

1916
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I am going to stream after

1917
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
the Golfit collab

1918
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It's probably like an hour and a half

1919
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
just because Zura's got a lot of things planned on that day

1920
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
So it's not like a big major 2 hour

1921
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
an hour and a half, maybe even shorter

1922
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Just so Zura can focus on

1923
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
what she needs to do for her donathon

1924
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
because she's going to be streaming for 12 hours

1925
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
which is insane

1926
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Once the collab finishes

1927
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
I've said roughly 2 hours later

1928
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
At my regular time

1929
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm going to doodle my gen mates

1930
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
but if you guys can be quiet

1931
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm actually secretly drawing a Zura

1932
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But don't tell her that

1933
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I'm secretly drawing a Zura

1934
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
but she's not going to know

1935
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
because she's not going to have time to watch the stream

1936
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
so we're going to draw her together

1937
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I'm going to take a picture

1938
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
of myself as a reference

1939
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I will show you it

1940
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I'm not going to show my face or anything like that

1941
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Relax, relax

1942
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
But I'm going to do a pose of a Zura

1943
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
in a giant test situation

1944
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
and we're going to try our best

1945
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
to draw it

1946
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
whether or not we actually manage

1947
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
the whole other thing

1948
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
but we're going to try

1949
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Hi, Zura

1950
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1951
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Hardy, hardy, hardy

1952
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
You're going to water them

1953
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
and then we are doing

1954
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
a

1955
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
redirect

1956
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
ASMR

1957
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Kind of train, kind of not

1958
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Some of us are doing ASMR on that day

1959
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I am going to be early

1960
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
by two hours

1961
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Two hours

1962
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I'm going to be early by two hours

1963
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
on the Golf Fit collab

1964
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
and on the ASMR stream

1965
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
These are two hours of my usual time

1966
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
but I promise I'm not changing slots

1967
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
or anything like that

1968
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It was just how the timing worked out

1969
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Don't

1970
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Don't

1971
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Don't

1972
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
think anymore

1973
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Why does Tavern Master say

1974
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
it starts at 2 am? It doesn't

1975
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Tavern Master does not start at 2 am

1976
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Why would it start at 2 am?

1977
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I don't know why it says that

1978
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
No, only the weekend

1979
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Golf Fit, a Zura

1980
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and the gang, 2 am

1981
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It's 2 am for me, not for you

1982
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
and then it's 2 am for me

1983
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
for the ASMR stream as well

1984
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Ah, I forget, temporary time

1985
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Stop it

1986
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You're all getting spanked

1987
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I'm not getting any of that

1988
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
But yes, I think

1989
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So I am going to

1990
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Whenever

1991
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Excuse me, that was a

1992
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
That was a cola burp

1993
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That wasn't this

1994
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
That wasn't the

1995
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
The waffle burp I've run

1996
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But yes

1997
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Excuse me for sleeping on the job

1998
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
When I do

1999
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
a live stream

2000
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
hypnosis thing

2001
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I am going to

2002
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
repurpose the script and change it up

2003
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
to make into a hypnosis video

2004
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
in general

2005
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Whenever you see

2006
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
why do you keep making live

2007
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
ASMR streams

2008
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
that are hypnosis themed

2009
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
You are getting the video as well

2010
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
on top

2011
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Don't think

2012
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I just need to change some stuff up

2013
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
to make it more better for a video

2014
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
and there's going to be a lot more

2015
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
visual things going to go on

2016
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I hope for the video

2017
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I'll see how it works out in the end

2018
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But it was a very weak burp

2019
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
It was, thank you for rating it

2020
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
though, however

2021
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But yes, it's a very casual

2022
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
and familiar tavern master

2023
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I'm looking forward to it because I've never played it before

2024
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
but I think everything else I actually have played

2025
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
We're kind of doing a finish in everything upstream

2026
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Like I said, we've got

2027
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Sonic Heroes

2028
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
We've already done that before

2029
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
We've done that before but we're finishing it off

2030
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
That's a stream snipe if you want a stream snipe

2031
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Don't buy the game just a stream snipe

2032
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It's not that kind of game

2033
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Let me be clear, it's not the kind of game you buy

2034
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
just a stream snipe

2035
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Don't

2036
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
buy the game just a stream snipe

2037
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Thank you

2038
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Putting the hip in hypnosis

2039
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I really like the hypnosis stream

2040
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Well, I'm going for it again

2041
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
The plot for the hypnosis stream

2042
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
is to try and forget your name

2043
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I'm going to replace it with refling

2044
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
It's going to be temporary, there is going to be a temporary effect

2045
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
just warning you now if that's not for you

2046
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I will have big old warnings at the top

2047
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I've not got my glasses on

2048
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
and your name is blurring together

2049
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Is that say

2050
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Kamni Rob

2051
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
or

2052
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Ke Ani?

2053
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Thank you for becoming a member

2054
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I don't have my glasses on

2055
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
and you're rather far away

2056
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Oh wait, I can literally

2057
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
You know what?

2058
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Sometimes I'm so low IQ I forget how to move

2059
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I'm allowed to move

2060
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Thank you for the membership

2061
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I'm not stuck here, I'm not glued to the ground

2062
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Relax

2063
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
You can move

2064
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
He said it, it wasn't me

2065
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It was him, it wasn't me

2066
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Look, it was me

2067
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But yes, I

2068
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Unfortunately

2069
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
got terrible sleep

2070
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
But there is fun things cooking

2071
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
and brewing

2072
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
But

2073
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I hope to have a big ASMR update

2074
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
for you soon

2075
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I'm afraid

2076
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
that I don't have got anything else

2077
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
interesting

2078
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Bermontide II Collector's Edition is $4

2079
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
right now

2080
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Oh

2081
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Well, when you put it like that

2082
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Maybe you can stream snipe me

2083
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
No, do it for free games

2084
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
We'll pick free games

2085
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I've got Left 4 Dead 2 on the roster

2086
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Coming up for a stream snipe

2087
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I'll get people in and out

2088
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I don't know how Left 4 Dead 2 works

2089
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
But I assume it's going to be fine

2090
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
As for other stream snipe games

2091
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'll need to take suggestions

2092
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Um

2093
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
But yeah

2094
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Anything on the corn side of

2095
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I mean

2096
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Other than regular Patreon

2097
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
or like milestone rewards

2098
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Yeah

2099
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Always

2100
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Um

2101
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It's a fun game even solo

2102
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Just wish, yeah, I'm actually going to solo

2103
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Chain together

2104
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I was having so much fun playing that

2105
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
It was so satisfying

2106
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I found it rather satisfying

2107
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
And I liked how nice the dev team wants

2108
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
to be like load your highest last save

2109
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And I'm like, yes, please

2110
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Wait until you get punched off

2111
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
a building by a tank

2112
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Um

2113
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I'm looking forward to Bermontide

2114
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Tavern Golf in the ASMR Yapping

2115
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
No, so

2116
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I don't have a membership ASMR

2117
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
this week

2118
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
But it's not because of anything

2119
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
bad or like that

2120
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It's just Taemin, like the ASMR I'm about to do

2121
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I'm literally going to try hard

2122
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
because I feel like I've been disappointed

2123
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
in the reclines of that being like

2124
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Oh, this is ASMR and like, yeah, it's funny

2125
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
that it turns into Yapping like every 2 seconds

2126
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
but I feel like I'm genuinely disappointed in some people

2127
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
so

2128
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Sorry

2129
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
So I'm actually going to try hard once I

2130
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
set up the memberships

2131
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
The monthly if I try I get to try

2132
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
do one thing

2133
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
But yes, okay

2134
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
So for the agendination

2135
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I am going to clean up

2136
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
all this mess and then I'm going to

2137
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
put up a membership stream

2138
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
for ASMR

2139
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You'll see the microphone on the floor and I'll be fingering it

2140
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Oh, sorry

2141
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I'm going to be tingling it

2142
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
That's what I meant to say, good save

2143
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I'm tingling it

2144
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I'm tingling the microphone, okay

2145
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
If you just give me

2146
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
about

2147
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
5 minutes to clean all this up

2148
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Surely

2149
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I can't touch the webcam because it's on a tripod

2150
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
and the tripod isn't stable but

2151
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
there is a lot more mess than

2152
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
what's going on

2153
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
The first one better, one try hard ASMR for every 3 ASMR Yaps

2154
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Yeah, basically

2155
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I think I'm starting

2156
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
to, you know, disappoint

2157
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
a few people

2158
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Sorry for being a Yapper

2159
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Sorry for having the inability

2160
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
to shut up

2161
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But that's just me

2162
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Oh my god, I can tickle my model

2163
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
tickle, tickle, tickle

2164
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Wait, I can touch my head

2165
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Bunk

2166
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
That's so cool

2167
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Man, I love techno

2168
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Man, I love pilot in America

2169
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I don't care why anyone says I love pilot in America

2170
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Right, enough

2171
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
stalling, I'm going to redirect

2172
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
into Sheber's, Sheber Tins

2173
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I know

2174
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
she's not up just yet

2175
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
but as a forgiveness, I'll let you look at my face

2176
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
There you go

2177
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Now you forgive me so much

2178
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh wait, I can see bad people

2179
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Can I see bad people?

2180
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Oh, you can see my tentacle

2181
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Oh my god, you can see my tentacle

2182
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
You're embarrassing me so much

2183
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Thank you so much

Anonymous

2185
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
for becoming a member

2186
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
You just don't gonna hurt

2187
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I bought something not on model right now

2188
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I'm sure

2189
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
We love yapping

2190
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
and weaponized autism

2191
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
It is rather weaponized

2192
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I have to admit, I'm sorry but

2193
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I'm literally

2194
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
if you didn't know

2195
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
thanks for the stream, thank you SaltyZero

2196
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
for the Super Chat

2197
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
If you guys don't know

2198
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
let me just

2199
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
crouch back down, just to have a serious

2200
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
one on one conversation with you

2201
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
about how weaponized my specific autism is

2202
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I'm about to

2203
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
hit a three month streaming streak

2204
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
which is pretty insane

2205
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
because it doesn't really

2206
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
feel like effort in terms of like

2207
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
yeah, I'm tired

2208
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
and I don't get much sleep

2209
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
but in terms of effort

2210
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
no

2211
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
there's no effort

2212
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
alright, that's how weaponized

2213
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
we are, we're about to hit a three month stream

2214
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
and we didn't even

2215
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
like, I don't think I'm walking up

2216
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
once I've been like

2217
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I can't believe it

2218
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
no, we're just

2219
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
just a little

2220
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
a little

2221
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
you are so much

2222
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
it's crazy keep it up, yeah

2223
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I'm finalizing a lot of

2224
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
ASMR collabs

2225
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
by the end of this month

2226
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
because either

2227
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
the girl, a few girls have agreed

2228
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
to collab with me but I've left them hanging

2229
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
with a script which is naughty of me

2230
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
that's not very nice, I've not been updating them

2231
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
which is why we're doing that

2232
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
membership script during stream

2233
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
and

2234
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
there's going to be regular

2235
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
ASMR milestone updates

2236
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
and then I'm going to pursue my meme

2237
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and hypnosis stuff

2238
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
as well on top

2239
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
she twerks hard

2240
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
but works harder, I wish I could

2241
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
just straight

2242
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
well, I do have a gift of it

2243
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Kendra, thank you for coming

2244
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
remember

2245
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
the Bratton Fair

2246
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
did she show the schedule? I did

2247
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
so I'm going to put them up after the ASMR stream

2248
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
the ASMR stream is going to be like 2 hours

2249
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
sorry, there's like still sugar on my hands

2250
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I don't know if you can tell

2251
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
go stop yapping

2252
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
go clean, okay okay clean

2253
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
it's almost like you'd be perfect

2254
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
in one of those VTuber ASMR company

2255
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
man, wouldn't it be mental if I was

2256
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
in like a VTuber company that specified

2257
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
an ASMR

2258
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
and then I never do ASMR

2259
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
even though

2260
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I'm kind of like

2261
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
what if all of us do ASMR

2262
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I guess it doesn't solely rest on me to be the ASMR

2263
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
oh yeah

2264
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
insert strong among us

2265
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
twerking

2266
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
can the cleaning sound

2267
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
so good? a bit of stucco

2268
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I do love the stucco

2269
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
right, I'm going to

2270
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
I believe Shimi is next

2271
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
let me just

2272
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
for once in my life

2273
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
let me

2274
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
let me

2275
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
nodding out

2276
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I don't know what that song is

2277
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
but once in my life

2278
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
let me lure it

2279
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
sorry, you're getting an impromptu

2280
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
carryo tissue stucco on my head

2281
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
for once in my life

2282
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
let me

2283
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
what?

2284
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
what is that song?

2285
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,760
I'm gonna pass out from my medicines.

2286
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,760
God damn, does the Waffles kill you?

2287
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,680
Oh, Sheeby's waiting when I'm going up.

2288
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:05,240
Man, that...

2289
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,640
She's not screaming the day then.

2290
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,040
Nah, she's not, so what?

2291
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,760
Eh, who would be next?

2292
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,320
I mean, the zoo would be next.

2293
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,720
In the stream capital, or...

2294
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,720
But I think she's doing a membership today.

2295
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,400
For once in my life, let me...

2296
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:24,440
Okay, I think it's Azura.

2297
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:25,400
It's Azura, that's right.

2298
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:26,680
You're gonna redirect it into Azura.

2299
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,320
No, don't care.

2300
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,400
I'm gonna fart on you most.

2301
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,760
Um...

2302
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,640
Azura is up and tea...

2303
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,640
My man?

2304
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,400
Nope, she's not.

2305
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,280
She's all sick.

2306
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,080
Hmm.

2307
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:41,920
Is she still all sick?

2308
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,920
Whoa!

2309
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,920
No, hold on a minute now.

2310
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:45,720
I...

2311
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,280
Fart?

2312
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,640
Wait, you want me to fart?

2313
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,600
Oh wait, did I say something about fart?

2314
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,680
Oh, we get confused.

2315
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,680
We confuse each other so easily.

2316
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,880
No, no, no, no.

2317
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,720
Uh, Azura didn't stream after me,

2318
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:04,720
which means she thinks she's not well enough to stream today.

2319
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,520
Is marriage streaming on a Sunday?

2320
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,840
Marriage streaming on the Easter?

2321
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,320
Yes, that's how I spell her name.

2322
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,320
It's really difficult, okay?

2323
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,280
Marriage seems plain and cock.

2324
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,480
What the fuck?

2325
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,120
It's literally called cock.

2326
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,800
Cock shadow of the common.

2327
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,440
Why is marriage streaming on cock?

2328
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,360
What's going on here?

2329
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,040
What is going on here?

2330
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,800
No, this is not happening to matters.

2331
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,040
Need daughter of mine who's gonna be playing on cock?

2332
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,040
Yeah, fuck is that.

2333
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,840
It's literally constantly playing with what you love.

2334
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,480
Oh, join her?

2335
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,360
Marriage streaming later, but it's in seven hours.

2336
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:47,200
What? I'm not allowed to read her, right?

2337
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,200
It's like that far away.

2338
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:55,200
Uh, well, I'm not allowed to read her right that far away.

2339
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,200
It's red.

2340
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,200
I'm not allowed to read her right.

2341
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,200
No, no, no, no, no.

2342
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:05,200
What wants in my life?

2343
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,200
Why is that?

2344
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:09,200
I don't know what that song is.

2345
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,200
What is this?

2346
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,200
Read her.

2347
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,200
I hardly, well, I do, who wants to actually.

2348
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,200
I don't rather wow.

2349
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:18,200
This Smith.

2350
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
Hold on, pull up the lyrics right now.

2351
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:22,200
You're getting an impromptu, terrial paper one.

2352
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,200
You're getting an acapella.

2353
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,200
What wants in my life?

2354
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:32,200
Please let me get what I want.

2355
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,200
Okay, okay, we got it.

2356
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,200
Okay, I've got the lyrics.

2357
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,200
So for once in my life

2358
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,200
Let me get what I want.

2359
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,200
Lord knows it will be the first time.

2360
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,200
I don't know the next part after that.

2361
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,200
But there you go.

2362
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,200
Right, yes, I'm going to redirect into Merchley Sheen.

2363
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,200
It's like, I don't care.

2364
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:00,200
I don't care, okay?

2365
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,200
I don't care.

2366
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,200
I'm going to redirect into a seven hour stream.

2367
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,200
So seven hours away, okay?

2368
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,200
A meal and a show.

2369
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,200
It is a meat, coffee.

2370
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,200
Oh, master.

2371
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,200
I don't know what.

2372
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,200
Wait, the maid cafe is saying to you.

2373
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,200
How do you say master in Japanese again?

2374
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,200
Obasa?

2375
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,200
No, no, that's wrong.

2376
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,200
Oh, no, the word is as well.

2377
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
Because I've seen it in so much hentai.

2378
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:28,200
What is it?

2379
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,200
Gojijisa.

2380
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,200
Okay, okay, okay, good.

2381
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,200
Okay, we're leaving.

2382
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,200
Gojijisa.

2383
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,200
Gojijisa?

2384
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,200
Gojijisa?

2385
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,200
That's fucking too many syllables.

2386
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:45,200
Gojijisa?

2387
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,200
Okay.

2388
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,200
Itadakimasu.

2389
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,200
Okay.

2390
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,200
It's cute, isn't it?

2391
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,200
Okay, thank you.

2392
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,200
Because I masked me for showing up to the cafe.

2393
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,200
Sorry, we killed you in the process.

2394
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,200
Oh, of course, of course.

2395
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,200
Right, I am going to...

2396
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,200
Eh, excuse me.

2397
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,200
Eh, excuse me.

2398
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:07,200
Right, I'm going to redirect into Merchley Sheen.

2399
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,200
Give me five minutes to clean up.

2400
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
I will do a membership eight some more after and I'm actually going to try hard.

2401
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
Yes, I'll be miserable.

2402
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
No, I don't care.

2403
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,200
You need an audio in that voice.

2404
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:22,200
I mean, she...

2405
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,200
Why not?

2406
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,200
Okay, give me...

2407
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,200
Give me, give me, give me...

2408
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,200
Alright, give me five minutes.

2409
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,200
And if not, I'll see you tomorrow for some...

2410
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Sonny heroes, Sonny heroes

2411
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,200
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

2412
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,200
That's the song, thank you, thank you

2413
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,200
Okay, I see you very shortly

2414
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
Good boy, I'll see you in a moment

2415
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,200
I love you

2416
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,200
I'm sorry I killed you with waffles

2417
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,200
Okay, I paid you, I paid you, I paid you
