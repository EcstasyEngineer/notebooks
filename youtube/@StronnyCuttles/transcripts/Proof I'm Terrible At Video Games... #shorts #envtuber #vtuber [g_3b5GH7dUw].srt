1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Alright, what do we actually need?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Trap the shopkeeper in the garage!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Wait, she's going in the garage now.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How do I trap her in?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, we pull it down.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We pull it down.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh no, I was...

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh no!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Help me lady, I'm stuck in your gate!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm in the garage mate!

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Have I just softlocked us?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, I don't think so.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The objective, get her stuck in it.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Me instantly get stuck in it.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Wait, until she gets inside.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello, come in.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Wait, unless I steal an item and run in with it.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Chase me into the garage.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, I dropped it. No, I dropped the freaking thing!

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh no again!

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Why is this so hard?
