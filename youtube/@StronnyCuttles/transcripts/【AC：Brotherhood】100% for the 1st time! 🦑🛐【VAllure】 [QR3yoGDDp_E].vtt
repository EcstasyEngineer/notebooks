WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
What's that? Hold on, hold on, you put the light on to the fucking tracking thing.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Ah, it's blinding! It's blinding, it's looking good.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Me? Hmm, why do I need to wear glasses? Also me, because blasted.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
About, like, one minute late, she hates us.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
You stop that. You naughty Nellie.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
You naughty soft fans.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
You naughty ballbags. Actually, don't say that word.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
That's not, well, I mean, that's not the right word.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Uh...

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Um...

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Are we here? Hello? Hello? Hi! Hello, I'm Marika. Hiya! Hiya!

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Oh my god, what's that? We get to do another full day of Assassin's Creed.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
I get to, yeah, ease as much as I like.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
Uh, I do want to say I am very thankful to PayPal support. Yay!

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
PayPal unblocked this.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Because if you didn't know, yesterday, you guys unanimously, at the same time,

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
supported, like, everyone with donos, and PayPal was like, halt, halt.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
This account has been paused because what on earth are all these things?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
And we literally had to go, oh, hello there PayPal.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
Uh, we're streaming. Uh, we're beach homers. Please unblock.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
So you can support my daughters.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Good morning. Good evening.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
And most of all, good afternoon, Reflings.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Are you ready to fuck up your sleep pattern?

01:50.000 --> 01:59.500
Do-do-do-do..

01:59.500 --> 02:01.500
How are you?

02:01.500 --> 02:06.000
And you did? It was Aisi looking after you?

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Did anyone touch your tummy? Don't lie, Aisi's best design element is her tummy.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.500
Her navel, if you didn't know a belly button is also a refer to as a navel.

02:17.500 --> 02:22.500
I understand you can't hear the background music of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood right now, ask that meme-in.

02:23.500 --> 02:29.500
I apologize for being a whole 60 seconds late.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.500
Do you want to know why I'm 60 seconds late?

02:31.500 --> 02:34.500
Because I was trying to arrange another Ace Markalab.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
I've recorded one with Mimosa, I need to edit it.

02:39.500 --> 02:45.500
I do not know how long today's stream is gonna be, so feel free to strap in.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.500
If not, I'll be the one wearing the strap in this relationship.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.500
That's terrible, absolutely terrible, just started.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.500
But it's been fantastic.

02:55.500 --> 03:02.500
I should hopefully not miss any freaking donations, like I did yesterday, because I was absolutely awful.

03:02.500 --> 03:07.500
I just kept missing everything left and right.

03:07.500 --> 03:11.500
Everything left and right.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.500
Left and right.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
Oh, that's not how I can read.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
Okay, there we go.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.500
Woo, five hours of sleep and eight hours of work, and we're so bad.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.500
Oh, please rest, okay?

03:24.500 --> 03:29.500
I can, I literally, I brushed my teeth, I had a shower.

03:29.500 --> 03:34.500
Right, well I'll tell you something gross whilst we jump back into the action.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
I'll tell you something nasty.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.500
Why can I not hear my game?

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
Hello, headset?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.500
Headset?

03:47.500 --> 03:50.500
Headset, I know there's, hello?

03:50.500 --> 03:57.500
Okay, I cannot hear any sound, and the game isn't coming out of my fucking desktop.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.500
Are you fucking serious?

03:59.500 --> 04:02.500
By the way, this game lives up to the test of time.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.500
Are we being true?

04:06.500 --> 04:09.500
Why is it not coming out of desktop?

04:09.500 --> 04:12.500
Is this a fucking joke?

04:12.500 --> 04:16.500
How could this have been so scuffed?

04:16.500 --> 04:18.500
I can't hear the game either.

04:18.500 --> 04:23.500
Okay, fantastic, fantastic.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.500
No, seriously.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.500
The tips link is messed up again.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.500
Are you joking?

04:29.500 --> 04:31.500
God, I'm so scuffed.

04:32.500 --> 04:46.500
I am speechless on why the game is not playing through the desktop audio right now.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.500
Ah, hold on, let me start clicking stuff and see what happens.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.500
Okay, I need to start clicking stuff.

04:53.500 --> 05:00.500
Why would the game not be detectable via the desktop audio?

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
I am totally not raging right now.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.500
Let's check, let's check.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.500
Right, okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, let me cook.

05:18.500 --> 05:23.500
Rule one, if something doesn't work, close the game and open it again.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
Because why would it not be detectable on desktop?

05:26.500 --> 05:29.500
That's rule one of gaming.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.500
So I've closed it, it's now closed, you can't see none of it.

05:39.500 --> 05:46.500
Also, I listened back, I was watching a bit of my own brotherhood gameplay.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.500
My voice actually doesn't sound that messed up,

05:50.500 --> 05:55.500
but I can hear it and feel it myself how messed up it is.

06:00.500 --> 06:06.500
Uh, yep, again, no audio.

06:06.500 --> 06:12.500
If I have to go offline to troubleshoot this, I'm gonna be so mad.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.500
Why? I didn't do anything.

06:14.500 --> 06:20.500
This is, I, Mercy has literally made a short about this exact scenario.

06:20.500 --> 06:26.500
I cannot make this up, Mercy has a short coming out later about this exact situation.

06:26.500 --> 06:33.500
Um, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:33.500 --> 06:38.500
Game, audio, output settings, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

06:38.500 --> 06:44.500
Manage input devices, manage output devices, sound mixer, is it a sound mixer?

06:44.500 --> 06:47.500
Input, yep, output, yep.

06:47.500 --> 06:53.500
Why the frick, why the frick, frack, diddle-y-dack, tic-tac, pedi-wack?

06:53.500 --> 06:57.500
Would this not be coming out?

06:57.500 --> 07:00.500
I think I actually have to go offline to frickin' jumpshoot this.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
I'm not even kidding.

07:07.500 --> 07:11.500
I can't believe this. Are you joking?

07:12.500 --> 07:17.500
Oh!

07:22.500 --> 07:26.500
It only took me seven minutes to start the stream!

07:31.500 --> 07:34.500
Oh, 49% total synchronization.

07:34.500 --> 07:39.500
Oh, I guess we are doing 12 hours then, if I'm only at 49%.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.500
Literally, Mercy made a short about this.

07:43.500 --> 07:50.500
I cannot wait for the short to come out, so you guys can be like, oh my god, oh my god, she was right.

07:50.500 --> 07:57.500
Um, if you are not up to scratch, please do not worry,

07:57.500 --> 08:02.500
because we have successfully finished campaign mode.

08:02.500 --> 08:08.500
We are currently playing Landlord Simulator 2 by all of the buildings at the moment.

08:08.500 --> 08:13.500
We are now doing the kind of save quest-esque missions.

08:13.500 --> 08:19.500
We are about to do a very sad mission for the Auditory family.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.500
Auditory, me, I'm still here. Let's see, let's see, Auditory.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.500
But gom, morning, good afternoon, good evening.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.500
I hope, uh, oh, it's good.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.500
I believe Asakul is the only other member live at this moment,

08:33.500 --> 08:45.500
but as always, when another member goes live, I will force you to go insane to her stream.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.500
Oh, okay, here we go.

08:50.500 --> 08:54.500
I do not normally do this, so I'm not too familiar with what happens next.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.500
Oh!

09:00.500 --> 09:02.500
I think AC is going offline.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
I see, in my old age. I did not know you had returned to Rome.

09:06.500 --> 09:10.500
It's Leonardo. That's Leonardo's voice.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.500
Hmm.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.500
What's happening?

09:12.500 --> 09:16.500
Etio seems to be remembering something. Something from 1506.

09:16.500 --> 09:20.500
Desmond's heart rate is increasing. I'm administering a sedative.

09:20.500 --> 09:24.500
No, the missing data may be there. The piece of Eden is useless until we have-

09:24.500 --> 09:26.500
Oh, I don't remember much of this.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.500
Let him continue. Yes, William.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.500
Yes, William! Congrats if your name's William!

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
Any Williams and her?

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
Eh?

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
Eh?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.500
The Da Vinci?

09:45.500 --> 09:47.500
Eh, Da Vinci- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.500
The Da Vinci disappearing.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.500
Did you know?

09:54.500 --> 09:55.500
Oh, I remember!

10:01.500 --> 10:02.500
Leonardo!

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
Good friend.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.500
I see.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.500
I see you reading Super Chess at the moment.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.500
You're- Wait, she got monetized?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.500
She couldn't have. I didn't link that.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.500
Sense accounts.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
Do you mean Donation?

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
No, they were doing- I was gonna say.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
None of us have monetized these.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.500
Uh, I think one of my assassins came back for success. We're from a mission.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
It's gonna be the Mona Lisa.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
Acical!

11:07.500 --> 11:08.500
My sleepy pee-

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
My sleepy acical.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
How is strum?

11:13.500 --> 11:16.500
I'm so sorry, AC. I never managed to catch any of the-

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
Snowberries!

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
Any snowberries?

11:19.500 --> 11:20.500
Hi, snowberries!

11:21.500 --> 11:24.500
We're currently talking to the historical icon, Leonardo Da Vinci.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.500
He's a part of the campaign.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.500
Get raided, get raided, get raided.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.500
Get plopped, get plopped, get plopped.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
Are you squidding me right now?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.500
Thank you for the 20.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.500
Bajinga. What the fuck?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
There's no way that says Bajinga.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
Did I read that right?

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
I read it in the top corner.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.500
Thank you Bajinga for the-

11:46.500 --> 11:48.500
What? You didn't even leave a message!

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
Why are you called Bajinga?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.500
Oh, now I can't read chat.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.500
Oh god, I'm so brain dead.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.500
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.500
Bajinga.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.500
Good morning.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.500
I'm glad you like icicles.

12:11.500 --> 12:12.500
It's the woman.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
Did you see the guitar AC design for-

12:15.500 --> 12:18.500
No, I didn't manage to catch her stream.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.500
I was uploading everyone's Patreon audios.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.500
I told you those guys were lucky.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.500
Fortuna wishes she were as good as me.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
John Jacomo.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.500
I do not answer to that name.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.500
Honestly, me is real.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.500
Better, but not good enough.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.500
Yes!

12:41.500 --> 12:42.500
I'm good to go.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
She designed one for everyone.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.500
Oh, I need to watch that VOD then.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.500
No, no, there's not new audios on Patreon.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.500
Sorry, I scheduled up everyone's Patreon audios.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.500
I'm really struggling to know how to tag though.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
If you didn't know.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.500
Of men.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.500
You worship their misery?

13:05.500 --> 13:06.500
No, mate.

13:06.500 --> 13:10.500
I actually prefer holes and no poles.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.500
Then he's swinging that way, but actually,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
he's not an against a mate.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.500
Wait, is this DLC?

13:22.500 --> 13:23.500
Yeah, Pink's Hole.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.500
It's not like main quest stuff.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.500
This is like side stuff.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.500
Okay, ready to kill.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.500
No reactive model today?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.500
Oh, I never put it on.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.500
I've got this though.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.500
That's if I make a joke, I can do that.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.500
Oh, oh, oh, oh, combat.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.500
Hold on, hold on.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.500
Get the wee knife out.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.500
Wee knife and let them attack you.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.500
Oh, I can call them assassins.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.500
So if I make a pun that I like,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
I can literally do that.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.500
Okay, the assassin's on the horse.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
I'm happy.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.500
Can you get off the horses?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.500
Oh, that was brutal.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.500
No, you can attack me then.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
There we go.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.500
Whoa, I missed that.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.500
Okay, there we go.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.500
Please God, do that as hilarious.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.500
Yeah, so if I come up with a really good pun,

14:23.500 --> 14:25.500
all you're going to hear is that all day long.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
Casually kills a dozen people.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.500
Apologize.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.500
Any apologizers?

14:45.500 --> 14:46.500
Man, let me burp.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.500
No, sorry, let me raid the horse.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.500
Jeez.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.500
I didn't mean to say that.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.500
Literally what I was about to do.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.500
Why is he running?

14:53.500 --> 14:54.500
Nothing.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.500
I drink honey tea.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.500
I have a lovely honey tea.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.500
Just for me, some honey tea.

15:04.500 --> 15:10.500
And a game full of nostalgia.

15:10.500 --> 15:15.500
And I'll play and ramble all day.

15:15.500 --> 15:22.500
So I can enjoy the game with you.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.500
I'm not even, I don't know what the tone of the song is after that.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.500
Come with me.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
Yeah, there you go.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.500
Wait, so what are you?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.500
I am a cuttlefish.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.500
I'm a siren and a cuttlefish.

15:35.500 --> 15:39.500
But the problem with being a siren is I can't sing.

15:39.500 --> 15:45.500
So I have to rely on my hypnotic abilities to steal the hearts of men

15:45.500 --> 15:48.500
and then perish them in the war.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
I did not make my lore, by the way.

15:52.500 --> 15:57.500
But in terms of who's the most evil out of all of us in Vealor,

15:57.500 --> 15:58.500
I'm pretty evil.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.500
And then it goes Emmy, but Emmy isn't inherently evil.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.500
She just really wants her brother back and she does stuff to entertain herself.

16:05.500 --> 16:06.500
Okay.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.500
What tea?

16:10.500 --> 16:14.500
I drank some tea, so if I start hypnotizing it's because I'm drinking tea.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.500
I would, oh you'd perish in my water willingly.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
Follow me.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
Follow me.

16:34.500 --> 16:41.500
We are following, following the leader, the leader, the leader,

16:41.500 --> 16:45.500
trailing behind the leader, going ahead of the leader,

16:45.500 --> 16:48.500
the lead to lead to lead to lead to lead.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.500
Oops, oops, oops.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.500
I don't think I'm supposed to be at this section,

16:53.500 --> 16:56.500
because they could spot me a mile away, but hey ho.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.500
Somehow things work out in the end.

17:06.500 --> 17:12.500
It speaks volumes about Vealor, but the most evil person is not the god of the fish.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.500
No, Azura created you.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.500
She's your literal mother.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.500
She created humanity as we know it.

17:21.500 --> 17:25.500
Like, so Azura is like the kindest.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.500
Mercy's just misdirected, okay?

17:28.500 --> 17:31.500
Mercy just, she just doesn't understand,

17:31.500 --> 17:34.500
because she does genuinely love,

17:34.500 --> 17:40.500
but sometimes that love results in your expiration date,

17:40.500 --> 17:43.500
which is a shame, but she doesn't mean it, okay?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.500
She's wholesome.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.500
She's like a dorky yandere.

17:47.500 --> 17:52.500
She lures your guard, and then before you know it,

17:52.500 --> 17:55.500
the finishing act occurs.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.500
And then, yeah.

17:59.500 --> 18:02.500
Oh, we're learning about catacombs that we can go in.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.500
Oh, this is the DLC called Leonardo's Diaries.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.500
I just remember that literally eight right now.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.500
I thought it was an auditory mission, but it's gone.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.500
Um...

18:16.500 --> 18:18.500
Taste my...

18:18.500 --> 18:20.500
Oh, no, we're just...

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
For size?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.500
Oh, I got a double A or something.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
Rick, wait, I'm going to get a quick drink of my tea.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.500
I apologize.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.500
Don't let her deceive you.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.500
It's all just part of her plan to lure us into her watery graves.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.500
Oh my god, that was such a hard word to say.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.500
Watery graves.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.500
Yandere grapes.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.500
Terrible.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.500
Again.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.500
We are jumping into the DLCs of Sasuke Brotherhood.

18:48.500 --> 18:52.500
We've finished the main quest, and we are going to try and 100% this bad boy.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.500
Think I can do it?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.500
I have no idea.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.500
I did not look up what the tank mission is, so I'm getting scurred.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.500
DLCs.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.500
Ah, delicious.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.500
Not...

19:06.500 --> 19:07.500
You're true?

19:08.500 --> 19:12.500
Honey is very good for avoiding illness.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.500
But Antelba...

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
And take back cereal.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.500
Sorry, that guy's talking at the same time, and it makes it hard to talk and think.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
Whoa, E.I.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.500
E.I. Burger.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.500
I'm a beautiful fish.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
Oh, we should watch that movie.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.500
The song is like...

19:31.500 --> 19:36.500
I'm a little little fish in the deep blue sea.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.500
Somebody help me.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.500
No help.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
No help.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I've gone too far.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.500
I think I'm about to desync.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.500
Oh, no, they're just walking past.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.500
Okay.

19:50.500 --> 19:54.500
Walking behind.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
Out my way.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.500
Out my way.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.500
Oh, I'm on the floor.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
No help.

20:01.500 --> 20:06.500
Strongly evil intentions through Cain's axe.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.500
Amy, Cain's intentions through evil.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.500
Yeah, basically, Amy just wants her brother back.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.500
And she Cain to has a bit of fun with the spells, really.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
That's how she was concepted.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.500
Oh, the Yoink Leonardo!

20:32.500 --> 20:33.500
I do not know.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.500
Katso.

20:42.500 --> 20:43.500
What does he say?

20:44.500 --> 20:45.500
I cannot read.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.500
Leonardo.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.500
Depente.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
Depente?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.500
He wants us to examine art.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.500
I remember when Leonardo.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.500
He was Leonardo.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.500
Back.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.500
The every lovey painting's hung in the gallery there.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.500
What do they have to do at their temple?

21:04.500 --> 21:06.500
You're the cuff, you're the cuss.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.500
Oh, it's Edgy girlfriend.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.500
Hey, thanks for doing the watch alone, baby.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.500
God, I can be the cuss cull fish that ever did cull.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
Hope you're doing well.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.500
Thanks again for doing the watch alone.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.500
I appreciate you winking at you right now.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.500
You got three deal?

21:26.500 --> 21:33.460
a three-deal? You wanna do ASMR together? You're slayed in on my Twitter DM? That's terrible.

21:33.460 --> 21:37.620
That's absolutely terrible. Please do not feel put on the spot. And anyway, I'm just, I'm just

21:37.620 --> 21:51.460
moving around. I'm such a fiend. I'm a little ASMR fiend. Right, we're gonna keep doing a Leonardo

21:51.460 --> 21:58.580
situation. So, if you didn't get any of that plot, Leonardo has been yoinked and he discovered

21:59.140 --> 22:06.180
some sort of advantageous thing that would, oh pardon me, excuse me, come through. Sorry,

22:06.180 --> 22:10.420
reading chat. I was reading chat, excuse me, I was reading chat, excuse me sir. Have you

22:10.420 --> 22:17.540
heard about this? Have you seen this about chat? Yeah? Oh my god. Slayed in right now.

22:17.540 --> 22:23.860
Yeah, slayed in my DMs. And then I'll, I'll do the rest of the work, okay? I got you covered,

22:23.860 --> 22:31.300
babykicks. Biba, biba an ASMR fiend, you know? Oh, Catherine, not Catherine, Christina's coming

22:31.300 --> 22:40.100
up. Oh right, we'll do Christina. So basically, we stalked her home and then we got a kiss. So

22:40.260 --> 22:49.620
surely this isn't gonna get weird any further? Reading chat, obviously, a mistake to do. I

22:49.620 --> 22:56.580
know literally doing it like in a game is so hard. Let's strongly lead my pleasure. I remember that

22:56.580 --> 23:05.460
it's, yeah, it was a bit, it was a bit sus. I have to admit it's ill. It was a bit sus. Now, we, the girls

23:05.460 --> 23:13.700
can do it to you. That's fine. You know, that's fine. By the way, around Christina, we're in

23:13.700 --> 23:25.540
Firenze. Assassin's Creed 2 is like Firenze. Oh, this is so sad. Oh, this is so sad.

23:25.780 --> 23:40.020
Mm. In Assassin's Creed 2, your family get hung due to treachery. This, this is really sad. This,

23:40.020 --> 23:48.260
I don't like this one. This is pretty freaking sad, honestly. Oh, I can't remember the past though.

23:48.660 --> 23:55.460
Mm. This is very sad. So the girls, yeah, yeah, so we can do it to you, but you're not allowed to do it to us.

24:04.020 --> 24:09.300
Come here, you fanny. Bunk. Oh, I missed, I missed. That was really embarrassing, actually.

24:10.260 --> 24:14.980
Imagine someone coming to punch. Oh, I did it again. I'm like punching the air. This

24:14.980 --> 24:16.820
can't be one air that's going on with him.

24:32.740 --> 24:35.940
Assassin's Creed 2 is actually very beautiful, considering how old it is.

24:35.940 --> 24:46.260
Mm. I don't want to speak because I don't know, for a fact. This might genuinely be the imported

24:46.260 --> 24:52.820
map from Assassin's Creed 2. Where the heck am I trying to go? Swinging at his family.

24:52.820 --> 25:00.980
Sorry. To be honest, it was, it's his first day. Yeah, his first day, as you know.

25:00.980 --> 25:08.500
What do you do? Only one thing to do. Kill them. No, don't do that. They did nothing wrong.

25:08.500 --> 25:14.740
They follow orders unquestioning me. That makes... Unquestioning me. That's a very hard word.

25:14.740 --> 25:18.100
I'll sneak behind their backs. That's a big word for scrawny.

25:18.580 --> 25:22.740
Time if I have to. Carry them down to the river. Be careful.

25:25.300 --> 25:32.580
Right, if I remember correctly, I can just do this. And there's one patrolling guard

25:33.780 --> 25:38.340
that will desync you if you're not. Oh, he's up there. I can see him.

25:40.100 --> 25:45.780
Oh, this is so sad. This is literally the bodies of my freaking family.

25:46.100 --> 25:51.300
Oh, I've desynced already. Wait, am I not to kill these people?

25:53.300 --> 25:58.660
Wait, did I desync if I kill them, Chris? Without killing any... Right, how did I do that?

25:59.700 --> 26:04.980
Uh... Wait, he perished because he went in the water. Right, come in the water. Come in the water.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.900
And you come. Come into the water. Come on. Good boy. Be a good boy. Into the water. Wee!

26:08.900 --> 26:14.660
You love water, don't you? You love it. Into the water. Come on. Come on. He's a good boy.

26:14.660 --> 26:19.940
He's a good boy that wants to come in the water. Yes! No! Jump in the water. Jump in the water.

26:19.940 --> 26:24.260
Jump in the water. Come on. Oh, wait. Can I knock him out? Does it count if I knock you out?

26:24.260 --> 26:27.460
Let me knock you out. Boom! Get in the water. Yeah, good boy. Get in the water.

26:29.140 --> 26:33.460
Right, in the water. In the water. You too. You're next. In the water. Don't be throwing rocks at

26:33.460 --> 26:40.740
me. That's no nice. Ha ha! Ha ha! Get pulled. Get pulled. In the water. Go! Good boy. In the

26:40.740 --> 26:47.780
water. You go. Okay, we did it. We did it. Okay, now back to the sad part. This is my big brother.

26:48.580 --> 26:54.020
And, yeah. This, honestly, it's pretty messed up. All things considered.

26:56.180 --> 27:01.540
Poppy down there. Oh, his body just kind of ragdoll and...

27:02.420 --> 27:11.060
It's so leaving their deaths to fate once again, probably. Oh, no. This was your wee brother.

27:12.420 --> 27:19.460
It was actually so freaking sad in Assassin's Creed 2. So your mother, Maria,

27:20.260 --> 27:27.700
she doesn't talk until you collect a hundred feathers because Pietro, the wee little brother,

27:27.700 --> 27:32.740
was collecting feathers. And once you collect all 100 feathers, she finally speaks her first words

27:32.740 --> 27:39.940
after the death of everyone. And it's just like such a freaking sad thing, genuinely. And then this

27:39.940 --> 27:49.300
is your dad. Oh, it was so sad. Literally so freaking sad. Yeah, the feather quest. That's why

27:49.300 --> 27:59.380
there's 10 feathers in this game. I guess it's a memoria. I have to leave the city. Christina, I

27:59.380 --> 28:01.460
want you to come with me.

28:03.620 --> 28:08.660
I want to. But I can't. My family.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.460
So you can always be together, Christina.

28:16.020 --> 28:16.580
It's you.

28:16.980 --> 28:28.260
Actually so sad.

28:31.380 --> 28:35.780
She doesn't... She doesn't come with those.

28:38.020 --> 28:45.860
And Christina's ex, he was like true love. And then so sad. She's feeding corpses to the fishes.

28:46.820 --> 28:47.300
That's true.

28:50.340 --> 28:55.380
And there was no in-game map for the feathers. Do you want to hear the worst part about the

28:55.380 --> 29:03.300
feather quest in Assassin's Creed 2? So my Xbox was in a different room from where the computer

29:03.300 --> 29:10.500
was in my house. So I would have to scurry to the living room and memorize a location of a feather

29:10.500 --> 29:15.220
and then scurry back through to my Xbox as a child. I was doing this back and forth.

29:15.220 --> 29:19.620
My mum was like, what on earth are you doing, Strony? I'm getting worried about you.

29:19.620 --> 29:23.780
And I was like, it's the feathers! The feathers, mum! The feathers! I need the feathers!

29:23.780 --> 29:28.020
What do you need the feathers for? I was like scurrying back and forth.

29:32.340 --> 29:38.100
And I did it once. I've never done it again. But we'll probably try and do it when we play AC 2.

29:39.060 --> 29:40.900
Which is our DLC.

29:50.260 --> 29:54.260
Allegedly, so the way I memorize things, I don't have a very good brain.

29:55.700 --> 30:00.420
So I had to open my eyes really wide and order. Oh, it's the crit sale.

30:08.100 --> 30:35.540
Wow. So after Chesery's date with fate, the crit sale got married off.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.340
And Chanel lives on the countryside and hiding.

30:45.380 --> 30:50.340
But yeah, I used to like have to, in order to memorize stuff, I had to open my eyes really

30:50.340 --> 30:54.820
wide, which I know seems bizarre, but it's the only way I could do it. I just had to go like,

30:55.700 --> 31:00.260
and then like I wouldn't blink and then I'd run to the Xbox and like where the location was.

31:00.820 --> 31:04.740
It sounds really dumb now that I'm saying it out loud, but it was the only way I could do it.

31:04.820 --> 31:08.260
Like the like phones weren't like, well, I didn't have a phone.

31:10.580 --> 31:13.620
Because I was a child and like, yeah, phones weren't like that.

31:23.460 --> 31:27.380
This is really dangerous because I actually don't know which way. Okay, okay, that was lucky.

31:28.420 --> 31:33.460
Eyes wide must take all information. I was literally like, sorry, can't speak. Don't talk to me.

31:34.900 --> 31:38.100
And then I'd get another feather and then come back through and look at the next one.

31:38.660 --> 31:43.220
And if you like pick up feathers on the way, actually being set a bit harder.

31:45.620 --> 31:53.220
There are guards everywhere. La Crescia is, is that just a straight jump? I think so. Okay.

31:56.660 --> 32:00.820
You don't hear a grown man fall into here. Literally, oh my back.

32:05.620 --> 32:13.220
Yeah, you don't remember which feathers you pick up along the way. So it makes it even harder

32:14.100 --> 32:21.460
because if you go to the area you think it, it was that, um, sorry, I got nervous. I'm about to go

32:21.460 --> 32:21.860
the wrong way.

32:21.860 --> 32:27.700
You're stuck on that side. No one will hear you. Are you ready? No. Stay where you are.

32:27.700 --> 32:32.020
Let me through. You must wait until the Tukesa allows you to pass.

32:33.540 --> 32:40.980
I can reach that, jeez. Another wind. Skyrim logic must be the best logic.

32:41.700 --> 32:48.100
Sorry, is there, I think, no, there can't be flags on the DLC. That's not allowed. Whoa.

32:48.180 --> 32:51.140
So that camera angle change, sheesh.

32:55.140 --> 32:59.860
Although I will say one thing about this DLC, this is so satisfying because, um,

32:59.860 --> 33:03.860
you really won't get caught by the guards doing this. You can literally parkour your way through

33:03.860 --> 33:11.220
it and the guards don't actually catch you, which I see is very satisfying gameplay wise.

33:11.220 --> 33:12.500
What a satisfying yes.

33:13.460 --> 33:18.580
Um, I do like the idea of, like, it so being able to, like, completely sneak undetected

33:18.580 --> 33:20.660
without the fear of being detected.

33:23.940 --> 33:31.220
Oh my god. Uh, I have terrible news, I need to pee already. Um, yeah, like, see, I love this.

33:31.220 --> 33:35.380
This is, like, so satisfying. Like, I'm just quietly sneaking around.

33:36.340 --> 33:44.500
Ooh. We're in the gardens of whatever that goddess name is and I've already forgotten

33:44.500 --> 33:45.860
what the garden's called.

33:48.500 --> 33:52.660
Okay, this is the bit where you can lose, I think.

33:55.060 --> 33:57.220
Right, you can't climb the hedge, I guess.

33:57.380 --> 33:58.820
Okay, okay.

34:04.820 --> 34:06.500
As if they don't hear me fucking...

34:14.020 --> 34:18.020
What was that supposed to do? I have no idea. Oh, I just went for it. Oops.

34:20.580 --> 34:24.180
They are so dead. Oh, the cret. Honestly, this outfit, they're gonna...

34:24.900 --> 34:26.180
Benesons.

34:26.180 --> 34:27.220
Gentle.

34:27.220 --> 34:29.060
Benesons Veechever?

34:29.060 --> 34:31.060
History Veechever?

34:43.700 --> 34:44.740
I'll redecorate that win.

34:44.740 --> 34:45.940
Plop, plop, plop, plop, plop!

34:49.060 --> 34:49.940
I'm sorry.

34:54.500 --> 34:57.940
She is home. Yeah, do you like her haze?

35:15.380 --> 35:17.940
Go, we are really a ladies, man.

35:24.180 --> 35:30.900
And one for someone who was special to me, Patrizio. He spends his time near Ilvatica.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.980
I'm not gonna lie, Riflin, if you did that to me yet, Mel.

35:32.980 --> 35:36.180
I'll give it to you soon. Give it to me.

35:37.620 --> 35:38.100
Guards!

35:40.900 --> 35:44.740
Place the Vinci's Annunciation in a cart. Leave it outside the walls.

35:47.460 --> 35:48.180
No.

35:48.740 --> 35:52.020
Oh, lo bene. Now, close your eyes.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.580
I don't remember what's happening.

35:56.500 --> 36:00.580
There's no way. We killed her brother and...

36:07.940 --> 36:09.780
No, we won the scene.

36:15.060 --> 36:21.940
Oh. Oh, see, all you had to do was put your pole in the hole and now the guards are on.

36:22.900 --> 36:24.660
So it was that simple. Come on.

36:25.460 --> 36:28.420
You heard that doctor at the start. There's a cure for syphilis.

36:29.940 --> 36:31.220
Oh, I don't know where to go.

36:31.220 --> 36:32.420
Take up the stairs.

36:32.420 --> 36:35.300
This is the most logical reason because why would you put the stairs at 12 o'clock?

36:35.300 --> 36:37.140
Oh, I don't know where to go.

36:37.140 --> 36:38.020
And there's a timer.

36:39.540 --> 36:43.220
There's so many guards, so many guards inside.

36:43.220 --> 36:44.260
We go back inside.

36:45.220 --> 36:47.380
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay.

36:47.380 --> 36:48.340
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.660
Okay, across, across the chandelier.

36:52.420 --> 36:53.620
Unfortunate.

36:54.740 --> 36:55.780
Door locked down.

36:55.780 --> 36:56.820
Okay, okay, okay.

36:56.820 --> 36:57.860
Ey yo, ey yo, ey yo.

36:59.460 --> 37:01.220
Sorry, I cannot reach out. I'm getting stressed.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.580
This is a freaking time hard.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.860
Okay, and then wee.

37:05.860 --> 37:07.460
And then run across, run across, run across.

37:07.460 --> 37:08.500
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.060
Okay, we can do it, we can do it.

37:11.060 --> 37:12.020
Come on, I say, come on, I say.

37:12.020 --> 37:12.500
Don't be scared.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.020
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to whistle that.

37:16.020 --> 37:19.220
I just whistled because I was breathing like with a small mouth.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.380
My pardon, my pardon, your pardon, I beg.

37:23.380 --> 37:25.700
I don't say my pardon, you beg.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.060
But you don't need to ask me.

37:27.060 --> 37:28.260
Oh, did we do it?

37:28.260 --> 37:29.140
Oh, was that it?

37:29.140 --> 37:30.180
I was actually really quick.

37:32.580 --> 37:33.080
What?

37:33.700 --> 37:34.200
What?

37:36.740 --> 37:37.860
One out of five pins.

37:37.860 --> 37:39.460
Okay, we nailed that.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.700
We nailed that.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.020
We absolutely nailed that.

37:44.980 --> 37:45.860
Who's pardon now?

37:50.820 --> 37:52.980
That was, that was scary.

37:52.980 --> 37:53.860
But we did it.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.980
Only one minute and 57 seconds is fair.

37:58.900 --> 38:02.260
Okay, that went so well.

38:02.260 --> 38:04.580
Honestly, can you distract on a horse?

38:05.380 --> 38:06.420
Can you distract with me?

38:06.420 --> 38:07.460
Whoo, yeah, you can.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.660
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, camera angle, camera angle.

38:10.660 --> 38:12.420
Relax, relax.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.460
Ooh, wait, I'm funny.

38:14.180 --> 38:17.380
Um, this is terrible, but can I go for a pee already?

38:18.420 --> 38:20.100
I need to tinkle my winkle.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.460
Please get up and stretch and get a thingy.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.660
I actually generally do pee.

38:25.540 --> 38:26.180
So sorry.

38:26.180 --> 38:29.060
It's like so quick into the screen, but I just noticed it.

38:29.060 --> 38:29.860
And now I'm like, huh.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.020
Okay, I'll be, I'll literally be a minute.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.340
Okay, stretch your legs and get a war.

38:34.340 --> 38:36.340
I'm going to get, oh, I have a war already.

38:36.340 --> 38:37.620
Actually, I don't need any more.

38:37.620 --> 38:38.900
I'll be, I'll be two minutes.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.820
Okay, I, oh, I just smashed your neck.

38:40.820 --> 38:41.860
Take off if you heard that.

38:41.860 --> 38:43.540
Ta-da.

40:11.860 --> 40:41.860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

meme about she be's concept art of like her looking like a horse she is a workhorse she's

41:48.260 --> 41:54.420

41:54.660 --> 42:00.340
that so I'm taking pink killers tummy heart unironically

42:09.540 --> 42:13.380
and then I had to record I kid you know I recorded like a really quick ASMR audio

42:14.420 --> 42:19.060
like two minutes before stream where do we post art on Twitter

42:19.220 --> 42:28.020
I'm okay I'm just taking some more I still think I can like 100% this game um

42:29.620 --> 42:37.060
unfortunately oh right okay let's see what we're working with here we've got 30,000

42:38.500 --> 42:43.380
so really not to invest in the landmark at the moment we'll keep doing the Leonardo DLC

42:43.380 --> 42:51.940
I will say one thing about the DLC was it worth the money like back in the day when it came out

42:54.260 --> 42:57.380
where the heck am I supposed to go I'm like all over the water

43:00.100 --> 43:06.580
you know also be apologizing for burping I feel so bad about people who like can't stand burping

43:07.540 --> 43:14.420
it's just innate like if you've been like kind of raised that like you know burping manners like

43:14.420 --> 43:20.500
obviously in like in person like if we ever do like a convention or whatever I'm not gonna burp

43:20.500 --> 43:29.860
in your open mouth but like I am just quite comfy burping on stream like I'd rather not like do a

43:29.860 --> 43:35.940
throat burp because it's like uncomfortable I don't know we're getting into the physics why not no

43:35.940 --> 43:41.860
you're not gonna ask me to like intake like give me fizzy juice at a convention I mean please

43:41.860 --> 43:46.340
strawnee please uh burping my mouth burping my mouth strawnee

43:49.780 --> 43:56.500
but please no you guys are actually saying please but my burps always taste like whatever I've eaten

43:57.540 --> 44:02.660
would I have to probably eat something that you guys like on purpose like fried chicken and chips

44:03.460 --> 44:07.380

44:11.380 --> 44:14.420

45:15.620 --> 45:21.380
son in the holy spirit we're playing it too old oried after and we're enjoying our game

45:21.380 --> 45:25.860

suppose the error lies in her Spanish blood I know it such untruth you so casually utter based

50:28.180 --> 50:35.140

and ignorant you should tell her that the high and mighty duquesa putana I have changed my mind

50:41.860 --> 50:44.420
that painting does not deserve to belong to anyone

50:49.140 --> 50:56.100

52:00.260 --> 52:09.700
I'm trying to escape this district it puts you like all the way into a certain section of the

52:09.700 --> 52:12.420
map and then it's like oh by the way go all the way out of the section

52:15.780 --> 52:22.420
and out and out shake all about you do the hockey pokey and you run around and that's what's all about

52:23.380 --> 52:32.660
hey that's green let's start wasn't even I'm seeing viewer from your pentas have you

52:32.660 --> 52:41.300
drawn your pentas a little too much the funniest thing I got a few maros I wouldn't say anyone was

52:41.300 --> 52:48.420
like disgruntled I think they were surprised so out of all the four audios for sheebie three of them

52:48.420 --> 52:54.100
are her in control and one of them is her not in the controlling position guess which one you

52:54.100 --> 53:00.900
all voted well the majority voted for the one who was me and then I've got a few messages and I'm

53:00.900 --> 53:07.780
like ah please I kind of maybe need to explain it a bit better and we are working on making graphics

53:07.780 --> 53:16.580
so you know what content is coming up and it just takes time like we're we're settling into everything

53:17.300 --> 53:25.460
and obviously Emmy got a warning recently and sheebie's lower video got 18 plus so I think

53:25.460 --> 53:31.460
we're actually debating about deleting it to try and ensure she gets monetization I would be

53:31.460 --> 53:37.540
mortified for the girls if they didn't get like they were rejected from youtube monetization because

53:37.540 --> 53:44.980
of me because member the girls didn't pick their designs and I would feel like so upset like don't

53:44.980 --> 53:49.220
get me wrong there's still stream elements there's still patreon there's still like tips on stream in

53:49.220 --> 53:55.300
general which is perfectly fine um heck I'm not supposed to go but I would like be mortified if

53:55.300 --> 54:00.580
like they had to wait an entire month for monetization streams all because like I didn't think I had to

54:00.580 --> 54:04.260
get a toggle to like cover up the cleavage

54:04.660 --> 54:05.540
hmm

54:24.180 --> 54:29.860
what do you normally need to do to get monetized 500 subscribers and 3000 watch hours but your

54:29.860 --> 54:34.660
channel can still be rejected um which is understandable like they need to go through the

54:34.660 --> 54:40.420
content but like um hoping you know all things considered like if the girls are sitting doing

54:40.420 --> 54:45.300
like game streams and all of that it's just another like yeah they're just gamers pass it on like

54:46.260 --> 54:53.140
obviously before we could launch I could only spell out so much like don't be silly of course

54:53.940 --> 54:59.620
like the girls aren't gonna be wait am I not to be detected I don't don't detect me I'm scared

55:03.540 --> 55:04.260

55:31.780 --> 55:38.260
one of those ones where they just keep spawning in more guys and it's just a waste of time

55:40.020 --> 55:46.500

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:42.980
do not let guards discover any dead bodies inside the restricted area these are I'm starting to get

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:50.100
worried about me 100% in this game I'm getting nervous I'm getting a little shaky what have I

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:58.660
gotten myself into now I'm confident in like playing the game in general 100% in it I have to

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:05.300
admit my confidence levels are diminishing the further into the game we get because it's starting

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:13.940
to get pretty like the ones where it was like don't take damage fine I can do that please leave me

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:24.820
alone no they're so aggressive watch out if they pass with their camera and their glasses

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:31.140
and they can't keep a lid the Vinci says

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:38.660

I'll try my best I mean it's not like we've like hashtag failed or anything

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:27.860
in all honesty right don't let our guards see a dead body so if I kill everyone

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:37.220
can I be detect oh it can't be to take you oh I always did it I'm like I did okay don't let

right okay let's try that again so guard no detect oh

01:07:55.780 --> 01:08:00.500
I'll try it but I feel like this is most likely a try hard replay section

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:07.220
because yeah his dead body's like literally ready to drop unless I'm gonna drop in the water

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:09.220
oh no right we're gonna put it in the

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:18.740

um I I've seen like the Japanese idol stuff where like you can just like straight up like

01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:05.540
talk face to face with your idol and stuff and I think that's a really cute idea

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:12.820
there's an enemy up ahead so there's no way I can 100% this stuff without using ranged weapons

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.700
this isn't say hey hey like genuinely the same

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:24.100

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:29.860
go the guy says because I'm still literally out here killing where am I just to leave the castle in

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:36.100
general I have no idea if we're looking north of the castle I need to go south of the castle I need

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:46.420
to go this way this is this is brutal I'm rubbish at the DLC honestly yeah I'm gonna yeah like

01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:53.620
literally 96.96 I'll take that because uh yeah there's absolutely no way wait I'm still gonna be

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:54.580
outside the walls

01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:05.060
if I claim to the top of that is it gonna take me outside the castle if I jump down

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:11.780
because I'm 99% sure you can claim the top of this so we're just gonna do it for the yule

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:22.260
me I'm the thief oh wait no I can't be detected silly me I'll just do that

01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:26.900
jump it's okay well don't jump then fine let's just fight

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:33.700
we're going to jump off the top of the castello because I think it takes us out of bounds of the

01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:44.260
actual area hello bye bye that thief me strongly not dying on sale oh boy

01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:51.700
oh here I go killing again right oh wait hold on this isn't a jump point

01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:59.940
I don't think is there I see a flag up here yeah I'm gonna be honest I don't really want to jump

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:06.500
into a bale of heat uh from this height is that a feather or a flag

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:21.620
the flag um I'm gonna be honest as oh that's the hay bale I'm supposed to jump into

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:31.540
the whoa this is a big map oh look there's the the thing and you can see the colosseum in the

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:41.380
background too honestly this map is humongous humongous wall do you remember that okay right

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:50.260
let's try this again I don't really want to be on the side of the castle but it's where it's taking me

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:58.260
so there's really more jump points oh it's the courtyard again okay okay we'll just go south

01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:10.740
the humongous oh it was crazy humongous what what are you on about honestly

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:16.580
where the heck am I supposed to go to get out of this castle I'm so um like swapped about

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:23.620
I know there's a ledge okay I'll get down get down

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:32.500
it's left or right okay this way geez we got there in the end I am I've not woken up clearly

01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.340
you know I think I might need to get a coal or something like I don't feel like I'm here right

01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:43.060
now this is the most pathetic wait it made me go out of bounds only to tell me the map is right

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:50.100
the unfinished work by Leonardo portrays Saint Jerome in the Syrian desert where he

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:57.460
lived as a hermit why would anyone stop I don't need the lore and the paintings I need the map

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:05.620
can I have the map please map map map I need the oh wait it's straight ahead

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:11.860
oh oh it's because of the the bridge

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:23.700
you're really good at this game maybe yesterday yes but today rough very rough gameplay

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:29.540
I still don't think a man can jump 100 feet in at Hebele and be fine honestly

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:34.740
game please I don't care about your stinky pay I literally I do like that they genuinely put

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:38.340
like all that lore and I'm sure like others appreciate it but I'm so sorry I'm very like

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:46.180
I can't be there's only so much knowledge I can inhale no PewDiePie not the bridge

01:28:55.620 --> 01:29:02.340
finished yesterday's Nike dealing before we say which is 4 p.m and it's kind of annoying

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:16.020
is Nike gacha I just know it's got pretty girls and people like the pretty girls

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:24.100

01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:29.140
gonna solve this problem to open the door yes you're right use my head I'll ram it against

01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:35.860
the door until it breaks down that's that's how I am we are gonna hire because we are gonna try and

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:41.140
get the favor of everyone at some point so we're I'm gonna take that money at the bank because

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:48.820
your bank interest can actually get full and then you're kind of wasting that income free money

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:54.820
actually the Hebele should be as high as the jumping point to be safe to enter

01:29:55.620 --> 01:30:03.940
I don't want to use my head okay last one of the Leonardo mission

01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:09.700
not the war machine mission oh sorry I just need to click with the

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:14.980
I think there's like five for the court did you say get busy as distraction

01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:56.660
that's so he also experimented with inks including an ink that vanishes

01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:05.860

the Pythagoreans behind the soul of the cracks in the earth like a beam of light

ignites fire which symbolizes knowledge

01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:50.660

01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:53.300
quest when you enter their place

01:43:55.700 --> 01:44:01.780
now before you're like brain rot gamer brain rot yes I know stone and leaves don't equal

01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:07.380
level thing but I'm just saying my brain is tickled

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.300

it's pretty clever honestly I'm like you guys are named after Lord of the Rings the meaty half

01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:52.020
why the half me

01:45:52.740 --> 01:46:04.740
I do not know maybe it is because they give me courage we must continue onward

01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:10.580
I suppose Salah is out having fun spending my ardent Florence

01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:18.580
he is safe at home I am relieved about the Florence of course you do not need to lie to me

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:22.740
oh it still gives the blessing

01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:28.660
I am Leonardo da Vinci at a loss for words that is a first

01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:35.620
this room could you support

he is soupy now

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:46.820
the sound of wind

01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:52.180
do you hear that the sound of wind

01:46:55.860 --> 01:47:02.180
wow okay I said these DLCs maybe weren't worth that I don't know what their base price was but

01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:03.220
wow

01:47:10.340 --> 01:47:13.380
Leonardo just casually talking to us while we're literally doing like the

01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:20.660
they just jump on the face oh yeah yeah I do

01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:26.100
here rabbit aim

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:34.020
whoa that's really smart okay must have been the wind

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:38.740
now I can get back up here

01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:39.620

01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:47.860
oh I didn't even I was like where the heck am I this camera angle is wild

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:57.300
uh oh it's so we're getting a bit dangerous here I'm not gonna lie I'm getting a bit nervous

01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.100
I'm gonna be shamed

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:04.980
a little bit windy up here yes it is ah my tummy's rumbling oh I forgot to eat

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:10.980
I forgot

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:23.300
maybe we finished the wheel is turning you are channeling the air keep going

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:35.860
uh maybe we get cooler and I'll get my snacky wackies again and then that will refuel me

01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:40.740
why it's getting laha

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:52.340
oh there's a bar right there I'm very struggled with the DLC I can't believe it where's where's

01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:53.220
the yellow paint

01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:03.140
what snack time snack time is the exact same as yesterday I am going to have I have one egg

01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:09.060
today because I forgot to boil more eggs before stream so I have one egg left over

01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:15.620
I will have two meat sticks and I will have pea snacks as well with a cola and water

01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:20.500
um I don't think I'll make another tea I'm not really feeling like a tea right now

01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:26.580
I had one before I did my very quick ASMR recording session I had one when I started stream so tea

01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:31.860
maybe not right now wow I hope this is the right way I've just launched myself down there

01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:33.860
without actually checking

01:49:35.220 --> 01:49:39.620
strongy when was the last time you had vegetables I actually just struggled to eat vegetables

01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:48.500
the problem with uh streaming long is I need snacks but on short stream days like I can make

01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:53.540
myself an actual meal so don't worry about me I know I had takeaway yesterday I had my chicken

01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:50.180
oh

01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:59.300
when his body's all mangled it's where they take him

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:06.180
you can sedate Desmond now yes oh my god it all makes sense

01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:11.620

01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:50.420
and Ezio understands that he's a vessel for Desmond to get information in present day it's

01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:51.860
absolutely crazy

01:56:58.500 --> 01:57:04.260
that's so cool oh spoilers yeah I'm sorry I'm just like I'm like re

01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:09.460
like putting it all back in my head because I've played Brotherhood over and over and over

01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:12.500
but I didn't always have access to the DLCs whenever I played them

01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:18.900
and then it's all clicking in Assassin's Creed revelations you're mangled in the animus

01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:28.260
and we had to go like in present day your dad William takes like Desmond's dad William takes him

01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:37.460
to the thingy to that location because it's a safe haven and it's where one of the gods are like

01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:43.460
the building things where and oh it's just so cool it's so cool

01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:53.300
Desmond's stuck in the mangled in the animus

01:57:55.300 --> 01:58:01.540
I have no idea who Desmond is but I'm happy you're happy so we're playing Ezio Desmond is his and

01:58:04.740 --> 01:58:10.820
like blood lineage offspring and we use Desmond's DNA in present day to look back at Ezio in the past

01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:16.500
Christina oh we just jump scared our oops

01:58:17.060 --> 01:58:18.900

02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:23.940
I can't handle this

02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:33.780
all right she's a wee bit of a slag but it's fine wait it feels really not going like I know

02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:38.340
like he never ended up with her because of revelations but why is this game so sad why can't

02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:47.140
it still have a freaking happy ending he tries so hard he's fine he'll make a good husband I made

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.340
oh

02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:50.100
what

02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:54.420
even Christina's confused

02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:59.860
it's you you're supposed to take her away you're supposed to whisk her away

02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:07.940
oh you're crying I've got tears in my eyes I'm just like can it see how one like happy end

02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:15.780
and so I like I'm really invested in it so storyline I don't get it give this man catch

02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:22.340
a freaking break is that the end of Christina's story I don't see a broken heart on the map

02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:34.100
there is no way it ends there for Christina I don't see a broken heart on the map

02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.500
that's it

02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:48.580
that's freaking it

02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:55.700
oh you can't do this to me you be soft come on

02:01:57.380 --> 02:02:01.700
oh for folks it we're gonna have to do the plane I don't want war machines now

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:06.100
no happy ending for the best character literally like

02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:11.620
there must have been more written I'm so sorry but I do not believe for a moment the

02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:20.100
development team ended it there for Christina literally it's saving him from Gamba and going

02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:25.380
do you love her do you love her and then that's it I do not believe one second the writers left

02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:32.980
it there if there isn't more it must have been cut because I refuse I refuse I refuse

02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:40.340
whoa what is a man to write all I know is

02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:49.220
but it's you will have a hell of a happy ending I can't remember what happens at the end of

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:56.260
revolutions I really did not play it as much like I know he was sweet on a girl and then she got

02:02:56.260 --> 02:03:03.940
kidnapped but that's not the true love Christina was

02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.980
like ah

02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:18.020
they saved it for the 20 bucks DLC honestly isn't that song miserable I have no idea

02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:26.740
I just if it really never man tension to brag it was never man tension oh I can probably renovate

02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:35.460
this aqueduct while I'm at it I'm like right next to it I mean I don't know I simply saw it it took

02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:41.460
revelation I took the revelation look to this one he if you want the Christina should you just get

02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:52.260
somebody's I feel sinking there's more wait what's her DNA sink 100 did it it was very low in the

02:03:52.260 --> 02:04:03.060
battery on the bar right I'd oh total sink oh okay okay je comprende je comprende right we're

02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:10.820
going to do Leonardo I think that brings up her total sink surely no it doesn't it didn't we were

02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:16.260
like on fortnight right hold on hold on we're steamrolling this right in memory we only have

02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:25.460
one thing we failed do not drop below a health score huh is this this one where they jumped me

02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:34.020
out of nowhere from around the corner okay okay let's try again oh we got an achievement for that

02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:38.900
did you ever okay we need 75 percent sick we need more I just felt like that was such a bizarre thing

02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:54.820
to end on calm out the pain will end soon I think it's when the guys jumped I can't skip this

02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:00.980
didn't know you could do all this in the sense of people here

02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:10.580
and she be is alive by the way for anyone who would like to watch her modes you have permission

02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:25.060
to speak momentarily all the music oh okay let's just play it all over again why not

02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:35.060
so good so good

02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:47.620
aroma yes or what is left of it since the borja came to power and the mausoleum unfortunately you

02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:53.460
cannot sleep from here series of course from the top of that church yes but the stairs up well I

02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:57.300
had to go by the Christina mission wouldn't show up in my game so you're welcome literally

02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:03.540
first and only girl in the series I so doesn't lose literally okay

02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:10.180
so someone said I didn't take the medicine like a dumb dumb dummy dumb dumb dumb dumb

02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:14.420
jeez oh wow because I'm

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.220
okay I know I'm replaying it I didn't know it did it like this

02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:27.380
doctor I like fully armored up fully healed up

02:06:30.820 --> 02:06:33.220
uh okay I'll take it I'll take it

02:06:39.140 --> 02:06:47.140
okay let's do this the totally hello mr. doctor may I please have oh my arm

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:53.220
salute I require medicine and you find a doctor you're 100 health mate

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:57.540
it's just speaking out literally he just needs a bit of attention honestly felt that

02:06:57.540 --> 02:07:00.820
I needed a bit of attention I felt that over time

02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:07.300
gracias four out of five doctors would suggest leeches but they have not proven effective

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:11.940
against such things however I can recommend several good colleagues around the city

02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:16.260
do you need anything else no sir thank you very much for your help please

02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:22.340
right checkpoint reached I've not

02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:33.620
I think it was the guards uh the guards hit me remember when the guard hit me around that

02:07:33.620 --> 02:07:40.660
corner I think this entire section is for that I don't have climbing gloves okay so I don't have

02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:43.540
what abilities I don't have at that time

02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:48.900
Chad doctor not prescribing leeches honestly

02:07:52.420 --> 02:07:52.900
right

02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:57.780
um

02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:04.900
what's my opinion I was having to pee it was a game yeah

02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:10.820
okay it must have been because they hit me around the corner when I wasn't expecting that

02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:19.300
literally our storm would wait this yeah it was definitely because they hit me

02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:27.540
we'll try and finish Christina or maybe we should do Leonardo

02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:32.500
for well it would be nice to finish Christina but then we're having like backtrack all this way

02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:38.900
right what weapons okay I do have my fast knife so hopefully none of them like

02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:44.980
fly out of the corner and attack me because that was what happened the first time like they

02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:51.860
started attacking me way before we even got to the gallow which is where it's supposed to start so

02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:55.140
I'll definitely hold back a bit more to be cautious

02:08:55.540 --> 02:09:02.180
like I didn't dislike Assassin's Creed 3 well

02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:10.580
I wouldn't play it on stream though like I definitely wouldn't be like as excited and happy and all of

02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:18.820
that and I really love how forgiving the counter controls are and brotherhood and revelations

02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:26.020
I think it's roughly the same um but in Assassin's Creed 3 onwards they like change the controls

02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:33.540
and I am definitely if it's not broke don't fix it and if you fixed it it has now made like gameplay

02:09:33.540 --> 02:09:39.940
frustrating like I really strongly dislike when gameplay gets interrupted because of like

02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:45.220
oopsie whoopsie you forgot to dodge this attack so now you're desynced and you have to repeat this

02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:50.740
over and over and over again because we've changed the controls and we knew for a fact that the

02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:55.380
controls on brotherhood were received so well because it's like our best well-received game

02:09:55.380 --> 02:10:04.580
you know like that stuff just makes me perish all right we're still gonna stay back we're not

02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:12.180
quite at the gallows yet but I don't want anyone reaching to attack me and I definitely have time

02:10:12.180 --> 02:10:14.500
to react if I've kind of got this distance on them

02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:28.660
sorry excuse me pardon me come through all right take your time actually I have smoke bombs I'm

02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:34.100
wondering if that's probably the safest method maybe smoke bombing them if they turn on me

02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:41.780
are we at the gallows yet I'm like getting scared I do not want to replay this if it's

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:46.100
literally gonna be like this strike from okay here is where they kicked off

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:51.700
I don't know if I should claim you know that

02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:57.460
that's okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

02:10:57.460 --> 02:11:02.580
okay I have access to all my long range I am using it

02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:09.860
please citizen do not walk in front of the crossbow bolt my goodness

02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:22.020
oh wow this is did I just I don't know citizens please do not walk in front of the crossbow

02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:29.140
okay there we go 100% yeah okay this is so much easier I did not realize we'd have access to the

02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:36.100
older weapons for this stuff as well this will make it easy that guy had a death wish literally like

02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:42.100
thank you for it's you did not kill civilians well because civilians certainly pop themselves off

02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:49.540
right that's fine uh double oh we've got one missing from this one as well

02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:57.140
don't be detected while reducing to a righty that's like super easy why have I failed these ones

02:11:58.100 --> 02:11:59.460
fake game are clearly

02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:09.460
uh right oh I need to do the whole thing over again

02:12:12.660 --> 02:12:15.140
10 out of 10 reeflings recommend strutting for distressing

02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:21.380
my door was this the game that had the terror defense no that was revelations

02:12:24.580 --> 02:12:29.780
because you were super excited and borrowing them to a barrel thank you that man is a traitor

02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:37.140
to our order your character design romancy of mesmer from subnautica is there NPCs in subnautica

02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:42.900
I thought it was like you versus all deafish I'm not pleased

02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:47.140
subnautica

02:12:49.220 --> 02:12:56.100
but he is an assassin not a traitor you run into guards well oh that's right that's true that's true

02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:09.620
the mesmer is a fish I'm a fish too I'm a photo fish oh I didn't sink my my cheeky iPhone

02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:11.780
let me calibrate myself right now

02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:20.740
ah okay I calibrated so now you can like really tell what I'm looking at yeah

02:13:22.180 --> 02:13:24.980
okay we will rock you for one

02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:32.020
it's a scary little fish that hypnotizes you stop it's actually okay maybe we will have to

02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:34.980
play subnautica I didn't realize I was in the game

02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:49.700
there are NPC messages okay that's great right how much ammo oh I need a restock ammo okay

02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:55.780
I'm actually gonna do the the pouch upgrade so we can like hold a lot of stuff because the pouches

02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:03.140
increase your ability to hold ammo like a lot more and it'll definitely help out in these

02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:05.860
kind of rewind situations

02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:19.540
wait you've never played subnautica I don't remember I think I've seen people play it which

02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:27.940
is why I say like I don't remember playing it um I'm in my tummy's wumbling okay okay

02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:30.260
after this one we go get food and fizzy juice

02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:35.140
boom

02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:40.420
wow that would hurt

02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:48.260
we can play it together and stream as long as you guys hold my hands through subnautica

02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:53.220
because I have no concept of what to do my son Claudio has been injured they are going to shoot him

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:58.260
not if I shoot first get the others because I'm a I'm a quick shot

02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:08.740
I may not have an automatic but I'll I'll do it anyway oh whoa whoa what are you doing

02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:13.780
yeah yeah yeah whoa they're like destroying him

02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:22.580
stop why are you just accepting gunshots that oh okay we did it we did it quick I'd run the guards

02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:28.020
can we hold hands anyway yeah I subnautica multiplayer imagine if you guys can come in and help me

02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:34.820
oh we should have more games like that uh right don't get caught while reducing notoriety I'd like to

02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:43.380
see you son oh my tummy's really yumbling whoa that was a good switcheroo words my stomach is really

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:51.060
rumbling okay as soon as I notice it all of a sudden it's a big problem but I don't notice it for

02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:56.180
like hours on end are you sure you guys aren't the one hypnotizing me because I'm starting to feel

02:15:56.180 --> 02:16:01.540
like it is going that way it's single player oh that sucks it would be so fun to play

02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:13.860
there is a mod but I don't know if I need like whoa what's going on there's like three groups here

02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:20.420
yo shouldn't be inter clashing the tree someone's taking the tree okay okay we're good we're good

02:16:20.500 --> 02:16:24.020
we're good we're good yeah not suspicious at all no no

02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:28.660
mutual hypnotizing

02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:22.340
stop being so nice to me and get me so distracted from the gameplay

02:31:25.140 --> 02:31:30.420
I've been told that I inherited my supposed to be very nice from my mother's side of the

02:31:30.420 --> 02:31:44.340
family oh well do you want to know what's funny my mommy has big bazongas do you want to know

02:31:53.460 --> 02:32:01.780
I'm like thanks mom so it all went to my butt instead I don't know where they went literally

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:10.180
they went all went to my butt instead so I don't know how

02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:15.700
you got your yiddies from your father honestly

02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:23.540
when can we get mum on stream stop she'll actually talk about it she'll be like I

02:32:23.540 --> 02:32:30.420
strongly just never grew anything um like I remember when she got me a training bra

02:32:31.380 --> 02:32:37.620
like so if you didn't know a training bra is like to get you used to wearing one because it's

02:32:37.620 --> 02:32:41.780
actually really uncomfortable like I know I know it doesn't sound like it's uncomfortable

02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:47.700
but like having something to strap down moving parts um it's kind of cut

02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:55.060
how much am I missing is that like less than 500 florins roughly

02:32:55.940 --> 02:33:03.780
oh um and like she got me one and I was like mum what is this for and she was like oh well

02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:08.740
I've got big gibberish so you're gonna get big gibberish as well and I'm like um okay so like

02:33:08.740 --> 02:33:22.820
I start training and then nothing happened no not like a sports bra like just like a thin

02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:30.340
fabric to like get you used to it and then yeah nothing happened nothing happened with me for

02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:41.780
but I'm not mad like I quite like my aesthetic some people like have struggles with their

02:33:41.780 --> 02:33:51.540
bodies but I am really lucky because I I prefer being uh not having much up but having a lot down

02:33:51.540 --> 02:33:53.300
like I really like my body

02:33:57.140 --> 02:33:59.300
yeah like small buddies don't get in the way either

02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:08.260
like all I hear like my mum will complain about like back pain and I'm like uh the only pain

02:34:08.820 --> 02:34:16.900
I get is like I don't get any pain because of my physique I would say that sorry I'm trying to like

02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:24.580
think and do things at the same time and it's not working out um I would say like my physique

02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:32.180
just means like I'm always good to go basically uh right we'll be doing another DNA

02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:40.820
bro but do you know okay there's quite a lot oh no only two only two

02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:48.660
do castle crusher no I don't want to do you the burdens we carry no I don't want to do you either

02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:54.740
right I'm gonna avoid any don't be I can do it in this one I know how to do that one

02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:07.380
so I just went on a massive ramble about that milk milk and dump truck as I go oh mini milk is

02:35:07.700 --> 02:35:15.700
yeah mini mocha oh no we don't have our sassan recruits but we should at this point

02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:26.340
it's gonna be a bit painful wait where are you gonna get some food oh I was

02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:30.260
okay we'll do it after this one see you guys distracted me

02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:32.260
be fine stay alert

02:35:33.780 --> 02:35:42.340
oofy I forgot to get up wait I have one sassan recruit thing

02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:46.260
is that because I only had one at the time

02:35:48.900 --> 02:35:54.420
oh no it's because they're all away on missions right now okay so if my sassans are way on missions

02:35:54.420 --> 02:36:00.820
they're not available during recall that's yeah I understand that's probably like programming

02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:05.940
would have been a nightmare so yeah no that makes sense okay I won't send my recruits away too much

02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:11.780
anymore if that is the result I can send away the lower level ones because they do not count for the

02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:18.260
assassin signal I'm just gonna do this right now because I'm pretty sure it'll count towards my

02:36:18.260 --> 02:36:21.620
hiring the to lure the guards

02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:36.900
at the end of every week each one of us I'm starting to get lightheaded oopsies

02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:40.100
should have got some food bozos

02:36:40.260 --> 02:36:51.860
yeah you put everyone else on quest literally I need to go around and find all these gestures

02:36:51.860 --> 02:36:56.740
I don't know what happens at the end of the gesture thing like they get money or just something

02:36:56.740 --> 02:37:05.380
happen where does that senator I'm wondering should I stall right now so all my recruits come back

02:37:05.380 --> 02:37:11.460
for this mission right yes we're gonna do that that's probably the best idea right now so I don't

02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:16.260

Let's go play on his own there and break the fourth wall.

02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:22.220
My god the shibu shima's layer is hell yeah it's how you go watch her.

02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:25.860
I could have sworn I was in that hay bale but whatever.

02:44:25.860 --> 02:44:28.020
You were, a guard shoved me out.

02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:31.020
I got bullied.

02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:34.020
Yes all your flooring- oh how dear you.

02:44:34.020 --> 02:44:35.860
A guard attacked me, how am I alive?

02:44:35.860 --> 02:44:37.940
Did the mission just reset?

02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:46.580
Right I can see that I've got three sassan signals so this is gonna make things a heck of a lot of you.

02:44:50.660 --> 02:44:54.420
I completely forgot I bought chocolate covered raisins

02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:57.220
and I have chocolate covered raisins and I'm sorry I had.

02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:02.980
They just pushed me out I guess.

02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:06.660
Make an exception for her.

02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:12.420
Right I...

02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:18.580
Oh am I allowed to be detected at this stage?

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:24.580
Do not be detected while escorting the senator so I'm not escorting just yet.

02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:29.300
I know I said that wrong so I repeated it to seem like I said on purpose but the truth is I didn't.

02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:36.500
I like how the senator couldn't like perfectly see through it.

02:45:36.500 --> 02:45:40.820
By the way sorry I just noticed a mean tag in the reply under your schedule that Cephalophogre is that correct?

02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:43.060
Have I spelled it wrong?

02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:47.220
I probably spelled it wrong then.

02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:53.860
This is what you guys need to tell me what to do because I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

02:45:55.460 --> 02:45:59.220
Friends these days unfortunately I'm not one of them.

02:46:00.980 --> 02:46:02.180
Cephalophogre!

02:46:02.740 --> 02:46:04.740
He fights the guards and gives away money.

02:46:11.220 --> 02:46:14.740
So honey someone on Twitter made a VTuber fruit tier list and they fit you in impressive.

02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:17.540
Oh yeah they like my fringe tipped.

02:46:20.100 --> 02:46:21.860
Hold on I'm taking a sipping to Nicola.

02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:23.220
Did you guys get up and start to leave?

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:26.420
I'm so sorry.

02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:30.260
I don't know what's going on with my tum tum I'm having to take more pain killers

02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:34.020
but I'm having them with food so it's not going to hurt me.

02:46:34.900 --> 02:46:36.820
I promise it's not going to hurt.

02:46:42.420 --> 02:46:44.580
Cephalophogre honestly.

02:46:53.620 --> 02:46:54.820
Oh burp warning.

02:46:55.060 --> 02:47:00.980
I burp a lot when I eat so please brace yourself if you're not uh

02:47:01.780 --> 02:47:06.020
not that you're not into burping but I understand that some people being rude that burping is very

02:47:07.140 --> 02:47:08.100
rude but I

02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:12.260
Oh I liked her scream.

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:21.620
Okay in order if you look away your assassin recruits will despawn faster

02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:25.380
and then they'll re like start reloading quicker.

02:47:28.020 --> 02:47:28.820
Did you see the art?

02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:38.020
I've been locked out of my Twitter and I keep getting locked out of it to the point where

02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:42.340
it's inaccessible and it keeps telling me to do these like stupid capture thing

02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:46.020
and it keeps saying um

02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:47.400
um

02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:49.800
no

02:47:50.980 --> 02:47:51.480
well

02:47:52.420 --> 02:48:00.340
I did not see them at all and so it says like verification complete you're human

02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:06.980
and then it says error submitting and I can't do anything I don't know what I want me to do

02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:15.380
um so I've been locked out of my alt one I've not had a chance to check out my

02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:19.940
current one it's the music's a load of my ears sorry I need to hear my headset then

02:48:19.940 --> 02:48:24.340
then you turn the games on or is it just being a bit dramatic at this stage

02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:27.540
on the appropriate width of women's league

02:48:27.540 --> 02:48:32.180
not you you raise money for false causes to pay back the gambling debts

02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:35.060
they're gang violence and I'm right now barfy a smart win

02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:39.700
um am I allowed to confess I've already recorded it

02:48:39.860 --> 02:48:44.260
this is the most significant I sat in my recording this for 15 minutes

02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:50.340
I had one bottle of water and one can of cola and I fell ill after recording it

02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:58.980
but I already recorded it I'm so sorry if it's not your thing but I it's the truth I already

02:48:58.980 --> 02:49:07.940
recorded it I thought it was funny but I don't really have manners so I was raised in a bar

02:49:10.660 --> 02:49:18.660
I've just gone oh management unlocked my alternative twitter okay I'll go I'll look after

02:49:18.660 --> 02:49:23.860
stream and then I'll see what I've missed because I think it's very possible I've missed a lot of

02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:32.500
fan arts or clips oh someone clipped me plain assassin's creed and someone clipped me um

02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:39.860
um when me and the horse were beating up the captain um I was like giggling my little butt off

02:49:39.860 --> 02:49:47.780
at the club it was so good I'm going to tweet it out um because like it was just so funny um

02:49:47.780 --> 02:49:51.380
and like I really appreciate anyone that clips me because like clipping takes so much time

02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:56.580
how long will the audio be I think it's roughly 15 minutes after editing because

02:49:57.300 --> 02:50:04.020
um I'm doing a lot of what I call live ASMR where like I don't edit out all my mistakes and stuff

02:50:04.020 --> 02:50:10.100
like I know this sounds a bit funny saying it like that but um

02:50:14.820 --> 02:50:22.500
uh sorry um what was the same word of gone I'm sorry my brain's too small to think and talk

02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:29.220
at the same time oh yeah live ASMR um I've really been enjoying doing it instead of like the super

02:50:29.220 --> 02:50:34.900
hyper edited approach like if like I make a bump then I just lower the volume so it's still

02:50:34.900 --> 02:50:42.740
acceptable for ASMR and like if not like at one point my cat um came in my recording booth and

02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:48.820
I was like do you want to do ASMR with me and my baby boy was like so I'm just like going to leave

02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:57.940
it in because it's just so precious and I really like it um like I've really enjoyed doing like

02:50:57.940 --> 02:51:06.420
live ASMR instead of like try hard even more um like I've done like non-scripted ones as well

02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:17.060
where I'm rambling out my butt like so much um if it's not scripted my ramble ASMR is ridiculous

02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:21.460
like it's not even ASMR honestly like it's just me like goofing off talking about whatever I like

02:51:22.100 --> 02:51:31.860
um whoa whoa I've accidentally hired this group when I'm how is the senator under attack

02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:36.420
I don't even know he's under attack there's no one that patrols that way

02:51:38.260 --> 02:51:44.740
as long as I don't get discovered I could me and yeah what happened we're addicted to the yapping

02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:48.500
where can I hear the ASMR it'll just be on youtube I do need to edit it I've got a few

02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:55.140
things first before I start doing my uh 1000 subscriber thank you ASMR's um like I've got

02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:59.780
a few collabs that I need to focus on first like I really whoa whoa whoa why did all of that

02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:03.780
did I not perish you guys

02:52:07.860 --> 02:52:10.100

02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:20.420
okay they're gonna fight each other wait what yeah so this is true um

02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:24.900
taser ASMR unlocked by she what is she doing ASMR right now

02:52:25.060 --> 02:52:32.180
um but yeah my rambling ASMR is like always end up like non-scripted always end up in a massive

02:52:32.180 --> 02:52:37.140
ramble that's not even ASMR like there's so many things in it out because at one point during one

02:52:37.140 --> 02:52:42.180

02:59:36.500 --> 02:59:43.380
I kind of plan to do like one endurance game stream a week so next week is Skyrim for endurance

02:59:44.580 --> 02:59:52.500
then we have Elden Ring for two weeks in a row after that so I'm playing the DLC with you guys

02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:58.420
first and then I'm playing multiplayer with sin sister um

03:00:01.540 --> 03:00:08.820
and we also have shot callers and heart rate winners and all that jazz um thankfully sin sister

03:00:08.820 --> 03:00:16.180
is an endurance streamer so like if you ever get annoyed like uh I hate it like when streamers like

03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:22.420
don't finish a game I don't like either which is why I would love to get endurance streamers first

03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:28.740
borderlands too I would love to do a vtuber playthrough like you know the vtuber's the problem is

03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:36.740
if people aren't endurance streamers that's like oh so long whereas if you can find an

03:00:36.740 --> 03:00:42.900
endurance it takes maybe three streams max if you want to just blast through the campaign maybe even two

03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:44.900
honestly

03:00:52.500 --> 03:01:03.220
I'm sucking my fingers I don't know why my tongue's coming out oh it thinks my fingers are my tongue

03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:10.660
that's so cool I love this I don't know if I've ever been

03:01:11.380 --> 03:01:15.700
borderlands too is like a hoot in a hole or it's like a fun game honestly

03:01:16.420 --> 03:01:26.900
oh maybe I should look at Marshmallow while I do this yes I will look at Marshmallow that's so silly

03:01:33.300 --> 03:01:38.500
oh my goodness I have a hundred more questions than I did yesterday oops

03:01:39.220 --> 03:01:45.780
any chance there'll be a full body pillow for sale in the future yes um

03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:52.980
ubu market are like absolutely amazing to work with and they were like whenever a girl has a

good to be heard didn't it um maybe a hundred percent open to any merch uh we are going to

03:02:37.860 --> 03:02:44.100
establish ourselves first and then I'm gonna reach out to a very unique merchandise line

03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:48.420
because I have no idea how to bridge a connection between that but I'll give it a shot you know

03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:53.780
you can only do but ask if you do not ask you do not receive so I will ask I will see if it's possible

03:02:54.340 --> 03:03:02.740
if it's not possible then we tried um would it be uh I'm not going to let you know what those

03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:10.020

03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:24.580

03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:32.580
the two streams but it never came up oh no wait wait wait wait wait why would it not come up

03:03:35.540 --> 03:03:46.100
why would you get filtered I don't it was broken before it's fixed now but why would it not show up

03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:57.380
I have bejinga narrow tiny spiny and bejinga again for today it broke yesterday please tell me if

03:03:57.380 --> 03:04:03.940
your money didn't go through or did go through the PayPal was broken because you guys gave us

03:04:03.940 --> 03:04:10.500
so much money you broke the cricket PayPal but it's unbroken that's what's fun it is a legal

03:04:10.500 --> 03:04:20.660
requirement of all reeflings to love strong stuff um I also was thinking I need to find an artist to

03:04:20.660 --> 03:04:28.980
do this one that's good with all body types I would love for our six month anniversary to have a mouse

03:04:28.980 --> 03:04:36.260
pad of all of us together like one of those big flat mouse pads I would adore to have us all together

03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:39.620
absolutely adore it

03:04:42.180 --> 03:04:46.500
but I would need to get like a really good artist for that like I would not want to waste money

03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:51.460
dicking around with artists like I would want an artist to like fucking smoke it

03:04:54.580 --> 03:05:02.020
I know I adore it okay um since there's a notification discord server would it be possible

03:05:02.020 --> 03:05:08.740
for you to upload the unarchive stuff the discord like a thread and unarchive stuff do you mean

03:05:08.740 --> 03:05:17.300
like karaoke stream or the ASMR stream that went kaput um I think because we like can't we shouldn't

03:05:17.300 --> 03:05:23.460
really host it because I got taken off so I don't want to like be the ones responsible if that makes

03:05:23.460 --> 03:05:30.980
sense like archive annons shout out to archive annons like for saving everyone's butts I for me

03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:34.420
I am open to suggestion if you don't like the suggestion please you're more than welcome to

03:05:34.420 --> 03:05:39.700
give me your opinion again and marshmallow but archive annons if a broke don't fix it

03:05:39.700 --> 03:05:45.060
they've been doing fantastic they've been catching um what's been put out there and yeah

03:05:46.020 --> 03:05:47.140
hmm

03:05:57.620 --> 03:06:04.660
our alternative stream is going to be free to access yes I do not personally believe in paying more

03:06:04.660 --> 03:06:11.380
than like 10 us dollars to like fully support your oh she and get everything that they put out

03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:16.260
there and the girls have shown an interest in playing alternative games and doing some other

03:06:16.260 --> 03:06:25.220
stuff um but I would not like them to charge for it I'm going to say to them like let's not charge

03:06:25.220 --> 03:06:29.620
but obviously I will never hold you back from giving any tips to the girls

03:06:31.060 --> 03:06:34.740
and you can always tip as a thank you to content that you enjoy

03:06:35.460 --> 03:06:45.060
but that's just me um like someone said um do I plan on raising the prices of what's been

03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:51.860
established no I don't I think I think 10 us dollars per month for all the content that the

03:06:51.860 --> 03:07:00.500
girls put out is fair and I think it's good value for money and I think it also shows that

03:07:00.660 --> 03:07:07.860
uh like the end goal isn't great and again like 8 20 split comes into it type thing um

03:07:07.860 --> 03:07:11.620
and it goes up in their favor next year type stuff if they want to hang about like

03:07:13.140 --> 03:07:22.980
I think if it's more than 10 us dollars you're you're not taking the piss but I very much push

03:07:22.980 --> 03:07:33.060
for value for money and I hope I know region doesn't always change the price of membership

03:07:33.060 --> 03:07:40.500
regionally which is obviously a big thing that's hard to overcome because we don't set the like we

03:07:40.500 --> 03:07:47.380
set the price but if the website doesn't do an alternative payment style then you're like you're

03:07:47.380 --> 03:07:52.980
getting shafted in other countries like there is a streamer that talked about selling games and

03:07:53.780 --> 03:07:59.380
it was like oh brazil because they lowered the price in brazil like it was fine and all that

03:07:59.380 --> 03:08:08.580
jazz i'm sorry i'm rambling i'm not making any sense um by the way cuddles i sometimes make a

03:08:08.580 --> 03:08:18.340
lot of clips as you probably remember from back then are you goober we may be goober i'm happy for

03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:24.900
you to use my clips with whatever you want whenever but i would prefer to keep the clips of you as

03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:31.540
gay can't is possible and i only share those with the reeflings really uh and i posted group clips

03:08:31.540 --> 03:08:37.300
with the other girls i'm happy for the clips of the other girls in the group collab to be used to

03:08:37.300 --> 03:08:40.980
monetize and shoot oh that's so nice of you whatever you want not like it really matters what my

03:08:40.980 --> 03:08:47.140
opinion is yes it does you mean that you goober um and i would like to keep comfy streams to you

03:08:47.140 --> 03:08:51.700
as long as possible while you go naturally and share well i've got good news for you

03:08:54.260 --> 03:08:58.660
the nature of my content gate creeps me automatically do you want to hear why a little

03:08:59.460 --> 03:09:07.940
my goal of a ASMR video every time i get like 1000 subscribers the reason why that naturally gate

03:09:07.940 --> 03:09:12.820
keeps me is because someone will come into the livestream after consuming that content and they'll

03:09:12.820 --> 03:09:19.220
go when ASMR when ASMR stream and then when they see me rambling my head off about a 14 year old

03:09:19.220 --> 03:09:25.540
game having the time of my life they're gonna get bored aren't they they're only here for ASMR

03:09:25.860 --> 03:09:37.220
five heads i'm playing chess in 4d already i already did it myself they're weak they can't

03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:43.860
handle the strongy they want the they want the strong ASMR whisper in you they can't handle

03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:51.380
the ramble and they can't handle the accent they cannot handle the so by default i naturally

03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:55.300
get keep myself you're welcome love you reeflings always had you in mind

03:09:58.100 --> 03:10:00.660
only the strongest reefling can survive

03:10:04.660 --> 03:10:10.020
first time doing this listen to your audio through oh wait i don't think i can read this one out loud

03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:14.340
it's a video link oh i'm gonna watch that after stream

03:10:15.460 --> 03:10:20.900
hey i did forgot a scottish game show show them the name of places in scotland an asset pronounce

03:10:20.900 --> 03:10:25.780
that's such a good segment love that idea i'm teal i'm stealing it now my idea now young

03:10:28.500 --> 03:10:34.580
they tune into a stream expecting like a soft whisper with an accent i just sound like a bagpipes

03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:40.180
i can't handle the scottish ramble also check to see if you're still subscribed to the other

03:10:40.180 --> 03:10:44.580
girls some have been called oh i saw that i was like really youtube you're calling us after like

03:10:44.580 --> 03:10:48.580
literally a 12 hour stream go and calm down it really should start to calm down now that we're

03:10:49.220 --> 03:10:53.140
there is no way you're telling me like it's gonna keep continuing because this is getting

03:10:53.140 --> 03:11:00.020
outrageous now like i'm not laughing no one's hee-hawing strawney it's not fair you give the

doors waiting on you all right

03:12:36.820 --> 03:12:41.940
sup oh i'm gonna choke sup less i feel they need to say something after that brotherhood part

03:12:41.940 --> 03:12:48.660
one stream what are you talking about why you don't think you could be considered or oh she

03:12:48.660 --> 03:12:53.220
why because they're creators that they were more experienced who you think are better so clearly

03:12:53.300 --> 03:12:58.980
would prepare them have you not followed have we not followed and supported you for a while heck

03:12:58.980 --> 03:13:06.740
i've been listening laughing relaxing sagging and straight jorgen has pentas for many a time now

03:13:06.740 --> 03:13:11.540
what do you why do you think that is could it mean we adored the silly scottish gremlin who's not

03:13:11.540 --> 03:13:16.500
afraid to be herself and treat her with love and respect no last kick that impossible shame

03:13:16.500 --> 03:13:23.540
syndrome to the curve we love you oh you're oh she case closed doofus oh thank you evening i love

03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:34.180
you replay is that a bag of chips no it's a bowl i'm like the p-snacks are really hard i can

03:13:34.180 --> 03:13:47.300
like dink them on the bowl without them cracking oh there was a marshmallow you wanted to talk about

03:13:47.300 --> 03:13:53.940
on the other stream but i forgot oh my god right hopefully i don't forget this time there's a really

03:13:53.940 --> 03:14:03.380
brave refling who messaged me well he's not a reflin but he's asked for helps reflings okay

03:14:05.140 --> 03:14:10.900
i i'm going to paraphrase it because i can't quite remember exactly what it said okay but

03:14:13.140 --> 03:14:21.940
basically this person is struggling to brush their teeth and i think it would be very nice

03:14:21.940 --> 03:14:26.740
if we brush our teeth together after stream like when streams ending will brush our teeth

03:14:26.740 --> 03:14:33.620
together i know that sounds silly however it takes 21 days to form a habit and i think it would be

03:14:33.620 --> 03:14:39.460
nice reflings if we could encourage and help people that might struggle with that so if you would

03:14:39.460 --> 03:14:44.340
like to brush your teeth with me at the end of stream i will give a roughly 30 minute warning

03:14:45.220 --> 03:14:50.900
so you don't have any sugary drinks or any food before because that's bad for your enamel to brush

03:14:50.900 --> 03:14:56.980
and i think it can be a really nice thing we reflins can do for someone even even if together

03:14:56.980 --> 03:15:03.860
we help one person hopefully if we consistently do it for 21 days we have helped that person who

03:15:03.860 --> 03:15:10.020
was very brave by the way that was a very brave message to come out with um i won't say too much

03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:18.580
about it but um you know you were very straightforward and said that um you don't you know consider yourself

03:15:18.660 --> 03:15:27.700
a refling and that's okay um and you know we can't promise that we we can help everyone but we

03:15:27.700 --> 03:15:33.540
would love to maybe show you a way that we can do something nice together and it's a lot easier when

03:15:33.540 --> 03:15:39.460
you do something together with someone so uh yes thank you for being very brave and reaching out

03:15:39.460 --> 03:15:43.300
i would like to brush my teeth with you when i end stream i don't know if you're out there

03:15:43.700 --> 03:15:46.420
but uh we can definitely do that together yes it's

03:15:48.340 --> 03:15:49.620
i see no problem yeah

03:15:53.380 --> 03:15:57.620
yes unfortunately i don't have a consistent time where we cannot brush your teeth

03:15:57.620 --> 03:16:01.620
i would just have to be roughly 30 minutes before my stream ends sorry i'm pushing in my chair

03:16:02.420 --> 03:16:03.460
you're pushing my chair

03:16:05.220 --> 03:16:10.180
hi strani congrats on debut i was wondering um nope you're done

03:16:10.660 --> 03:16:18.020
uh any games coming out that you're excited for uh multiplayer the binding of isaac apparently

03:16:18.020 --> 03:16:22.660
someone went data mining and saw that there was a new repentance after plus or something

03:16:23.220 --> 03:16:26.980
so there might be patches to current items which would be very interesting

03:16:28.580 --> 03:16:33.540
forming new habits with my oh she sounds like a tuition name honestly join oral improvement

03:16:34.420 --> 03:16:39.860
she's getting closer to i am the urge to crack a british joke oh my teeth are mangled honestly

03:16:39.860 --> 03:16:45.940
my teeth are mangled i'm like they're healthy but they're just all squint and it's like i like the

03:16:45.940 --> 03:16:52.420
look of i oh my god there's apparently a pandemic happening in america with veneers uh veneers are

03:16:52.420 --> 03:16:56.420
like these fake things you put on top of your teeth that are shaved down and it makes them look

03:16:56.420 --> 03:17:03.060
perfect but i feel like teeth have personality like i like my wee squinty winty teeth um i just

03:17:03.060 --> 03:17:09.140
i've never seen myself any other way so it's me oh yeah i do understand for people that do need

03:17:09.140 --> 03:17:15.540
braces like there's probably something else going on but i like i was obsessed and i never got braces

03:17:15.540 --> 03:17:22.020
um and yeah i just have naturally squint teeth like they didn't come out perfect and that's fine

03:17:22.020 --> 03:17:24.740
that's just how it is um

03:17:27.300 --> 03:17:32.820
mommy i really need a hug debut has made me really emotional oh a little reflame

03:17:33.620 --> 03:17:38.900
trust me i know this isn't about me but i'm talking to you now you should be so proud of

03:17:38.900 --> 03:17:43.220
what you've accomplished i am the girls have done fantastic and i'm having a good time with my

03:17:43.220 --> 03:17:49.860
weakness you and the girls but i feel much more lonely than i did before oh watching everyone interact

03:17:49.860 --> 03:17:55.620
with each other the girls respond into mario's maro's and such i don't even know why i suppose i'm

03:17:55.620 --> 03:18:01.300
just envious of the attention that everyone's getting i feel so out of place i'm so sad i haven't

03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:06.740
even been able to listen to your audios to sleep i'm sorry for being selfish it's not selfish at all

03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:11.540
are you are you maybe one of the lurkers that are shy to say anything

03:18:13.300 --> 03:18:19.380
or have i managed to successfully accidentally dodge all your messages and stream and i would

03:18:19.380 --> 03:18:25.060
be a bit upset too if you were talking away and i accidentally never read out any of your messages

03:18:25.060 --> 03:18:30.420
so i do apologize if that happens and well i'm sorry for a little reflame i never want to make

03:18:30.420 --> 03:18:38.020
you feel lonely if you are a lurker and you're a bit scared to talk that's okay whatever your

03:18:38.020 --> 03:18:43.540
comfort level is you're allowed to be that uh you can always say you can always be at arm's length

03:18:43.540 --> 03:18:52.420
or you can always be attached at my head you can sit on my head if you like um and it's okay

03:18:53.940 --> 03:18:57.620
but just i don't know hopefully it doesn't make you feel lonely like

03:18:57.620 --> 03:19:02.740
oh by then i get to show you my childhood game you guys get to show me you get to suggest to me

03:19:02.740 --> 03:19:10.100
your childhood game i want to sit on stroney's head yeah lurkers are beloved yes i understand

03:19:10.100 --> 03:19:16.660
for lurkers sometimes it can be a bit nerve-wracking as well to like be perceived with my eyeballs and

03:19:16.660 --> 03:19:24.180
like i i read out what you're saying stuff but um literally uh if you would like evidence from my

03:19:24.180 --> 03:19:29.060
autistic diagnosis please refer to my first stream which was 12 hours long and the only

03:19:29.060 --> 03:19:35.700
reason i went off instead of 14 hours of full gameplay is because of bod okay i'm usually playing

03:19:35.700 --> 03:19:40.820
something and lurking yeah like it's perfectly okay to lurk and just do your thing not wrong with

03:19:40.820 --> 03:19:47.860
lurking absolutely not um don't be shy reflame stroney isn't always reading my comments but yeah

03:19:48.580 --> 03:19:57.220
it's um a gooberino so i do apologize if i've ever made you feel left out um and hopefully

03:19:57.220 --> 03:20:05.220
it doesn't happen in the future um i can only apologize uh sometimes hi stroney want you to

03:20:05.220 --> 03:20:10.500
know what i think it's very cute when you narrowed out about sasa's group brotherhood well i'm getting

03:20:10.580 --> 03:20:13.860
rolled in the dlcs clearly i'm not built for the dlc

03:20:18.020 --> 03:20:23.300
i have a little sip of cola a fizzy juice i lurk when i'm at work um yeah a lot of people

03:20:23.300 --> 03:20:30.740
like lurking and listening to stroney podcast wait if you don't see the screen when i'm streaming

03:20:30.740 --> 03:20:38.500
and like i'm beating up bad guys and oh you hear us oh take this oh like are you like oh what's

03:20:38.500 --> 03:20:44.500
going on or can you use context clues i like to have the stream on in the background but i do like

03:20:44.500 --> 03:20:48.980
to interact i'm like yeah don't feel don't ever feel forced to interact i know some people shy like

03:20:48.980 --> 03:20:56.980
that hi coddles just wondering if you could forward something to management i know vealer or not on

03:20:56.980 --> 03:21:05.540
holodex but you can still view the stream of the url but i think the girls have something set that

03:21:05.620 --> 03:21:09.540
prevents their streams from being viewed through third-party sites well mine is fame

03:21:10.580 --> 03:21:18.500
i can't be right people is true screen off pretending stroney is physically

03:21:18.500 --> 03:21:25.220
throwing the refill and then around for sport um to be honest you talk enough that there isn't

03:21:25.220 --> 03:21:31.460
dead air so i don't have to wonder about what's going on yeah i can't believe it wait was there

03:21:31.460 --> 03:21:36.900
really no dead air in the last stream i must have been quiet at some sections there's no way

03:21:37.700 --> 03:21:42.180
i had the video playing i just can't fully watch the whole stream yes the streams are a bit too long

03:21:42.180 --> 03:21:49.140
for the average adult uh okay management's gonna look into holodex i think that puts all their

03:21:49.140 --> 03:21:54.020
streams together we were thinking about hosting a website that showed all our stream schedules

03:21:54.020 --> 03:21:58.340
but it cost like more money and it was just kind of one of those things where look holodex does it

03:21:58.340 --> 03:22:04.180
for free we're just gonna let holodex take over who goes there i died for yourself there was almost

03:22:04.180 --> 03:22:11.140
no dead air outside of breaks and they wonder my throat is sore honestly after uh after i've been

03:22:11.140 --> 03:22:19.620
done with you i watched for about five hours and wasn't it okay you talked the entire time i do i'm

03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:24.900
very passionate about this game very very passionate uh sorry if i missed it but what are we

03:22:25.540 --> 03:22:28.900
yes your reeflings i was very dumb and never showed you what you look like that's you

03:22:30.980 --> 03:22:38.820
i've lost some gnar twerk of a nature of us together and what's the old twitter check out

03:22:38.820 --> 03:22:44.900
who i follow on strawnycuddles on twitter i don't use twitter much you're much better given a like

03:22:44.900 --> 03:22:51.700
and a subscribe to this youtube channel i am not much of a twitter person okay in a gush i use twitter

03:22:51.700 --> 03:22:57.940
now pretty much to reach out to other vtubers and be like hey want to make a samar hey sweet

03:22:57.940 --> 03:23:07.700
cakes want to make a samar basically so i do i think your longest dead air was the sprint

03:23:07.700 --> 03:23:14.260
section where you were against the clock and you're still monologued more like monomogged

03:23:14.260 --> 03:23:19.620
because i'm just that good at being a yap or hey strawny loving the assassin's creed i was

03:23:19.620 --> 03:23:26.260
wondering if you have ever seen or played lost planet one or two i haven't there are fun games

03:23:26.260 --> 03:23:30.020
that i think you may like even if you don't play them i still appreciate you for beating

03:23:30.020 --> 03:23:36.100
this message i have not i've never heard of them or i can't remember them being on the cover of

03:23:36.100 --> 03:23:47.700
an xbox 360 so probably not have i ever played dragon age i played the demo of dragon age one

03:23:48.340 --> 03:23:54.820
i think uh where it's like brother and sister at the star and then one of them perishes if i

03:23:54.820 --> 03:24:01.060
remember correctly yeah that's how much dragon age i've done i don't know what it's like um

03:24:02.420 --> 03:24:10.900
but yeah yes one take flamboyant cuttlefishes are highly poisonous okay well am i flamboyant

03:24:10.900 --> 03:24:14.660
because of my watermelon candy here someone described as watermelon candy and i'm like

03:24:14.660 --> 03:24:20.340
honestly true true uh will there be streams on other platforms okay

03:24:23.380 --> 03:24:28.020
congratulations on your debut i'm looking forward to supporting all of the talents i must

03:24:28.020 --> 03:24:34.020
apologize i said that's so wrong i must apologize but i find myself confused what you meant by

03:24:34.020 --> 03:24:39.940
vealers collab restrictions and i'm looking forward to clarification you describe the

03:24:39.940 --> 03:24:47.140
collab restrictions as the unwritten rule through other information do you mean for me

03:24:47.940 --> 03:24:55.540
my collab restrictions are um i'm like if i don't know that someone is like me mentally then i can't

03:24:55.540 --> 03:24:59.220
stream with them because i'm dumb i can stream with the girls though that's fine and the girls can

03:24:59.220 --> 03:25:07.140
stream with whoever they like other than males they're not allowed to stream with males or interact

03:25:07.140 --> 03:25:16.820
with males or follow males literally that's the only rule and so far so good literally none of

03:25:16.820 --> 03:25:25.300
the girls have broken that rule scrawny slaps of each of us behind i can make you a star yeah um

03:25:27.380 --> 03:25:31.300
it seems odd for me for them to be rules i've never heard of any other agency that has an

03:25:31.300 --> 03:25:39.060
outright rule against them against who sorry i'm not read this properly uh especially value

03:25:39.060 --> 03:25:47.060
and freedom doesn't it apologize if it comes off with really critical however i think clarification

03:25:47.060 --> 03:25:55.940
were an issue oh and they can freaking go wherever they want oh this is asking about male collabs

03:25:55.940 --> 03:26:04.660
the person has said wrestle tube collabs were like mixed would the girls be able to do that

03:26:06.740 --> 03:26:14.820
i mean i would never stop them from an opportunity like would they be on the same team as a guy like

03:26:14.820 --> 03:26:20.500
i don't think i don't think that's like advised if it was like that like i wouldn't advise it

03:26:21.220 --> 03:26:26.820
however none of the girls have given me an indication to ever even do that like i think

03:26:26.820 --> 03:26:34.020
we would be like sorry but uh we can't uh we are uh following japanese idol culture

03:26:34.020 --> 03:26:41.460
and uh no male sorry sorry we sexist out here which is terrible don't say that i love don't

03:26:41.460 --> 03:26:51.780
say that part of it keep burping don't apologize oh yeah oh yeah hello again friend of a friend

03:26:51.780 --> 03:27:06.180
i knew you well the truth is just a rule that you can bet sitting my love on

03:27:07.060 --> 03:27:10.900
i don't remember the words pick it up every time

03:27:20.020 --> 03:27:25.060
hi stroney i think you've been one guy what does that mean saying names is okay as long as it's not

03:27:25.060 --> 03:27:33.220
too much oh no so the way i i've been taught v tripper culture i'm so sorry but i've been taught

03:27:33.220 --> 03:27:40.500
by the majority v tripper culture i'm not allowed to say your name unless you don't know or

03:27:42.260 --> 03:27:50.500
membership however because and the reason why i can't do it when it's like just saying hi section

03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:57.540
or in general is because like people think favoritism is forming or jealousy and i really

03:27:57.540 --> 03:28:05.220
don't want anyone feeling put out um wait that's exactly what you've just said to me

03:28:07.380 --> 03:28:11.620
we have just agreed okay we've just agreed yes we have agreed um uh at the start of the ASMR

03:28:11.620 --> 03:28:17.380
stream i am going to try and say people's names just as a special thank you for showing up how do

03:28:17.380 --> 03:28:22.180
you feel that you're no longer a v-tweeter well hopefully my first stream length really showed

03:28:22.180 --> 03:28:30.740
how much i enjoy video being so up cuddles was thinking of a tag oh i missed the tag i kind of

03:28:30.740 --> 03:28:40.420
finished them oopsie uh please do give us a guide for those script writing yes um i'm currently

03:28:40.420 --> 03:28:47.540
getting a new manager on board that deals with all the scripts and thank god he is a male because

03:28:47.540 --> 03:28:51.780
he can actually write scripts that guys want to hear because i can only guess what you want

03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:59.460
to hear and so much um so like roughly the first three months of scripts are me and then it goes

03:28:59.460 --> 03:29:05.540
to other script writers and then it goes to the script manager but we're testing script manager

03:29:05.540 --> 03:29:11.060
but if all goes well my responsibilities lessen so much and i can stream so much more

03:29:14.580 --> 03:29:19.780
well at the start of the stream you were 3.5k now you're at 3.3 heck yeah that means i don't

03:29:19.780 --> 03:29:24.100
have to edit the 4k thousand anytime soon that's fine

03:29:32.500 --> 03:29:37.300
hey i have to say that i think you amazing i don't get to interact with many scottish people online

03:29:37.300 --> 03:29:43.940
that's because a lot of things had to go wrong in my scottish life to become a v-tweeter that's why

03:29:43.940 --> 03:29:49.860
there's no scottish v-tubers do you know how i know i've hurt myself my finger is bleeding why

03:29:49.860 --> 03:29:56.660
what did i cut myself on i've not touched anything sharp is there anything sharp in this room

03:29:58.260 --> 03:30:01.620
ouch it stings hopefully i can still keep gaming

03:30:02.740 --> 03:30:07.700
scotland only has one computer yeah yeah no like genuinely there's a reason why there's not a lot

03:30:07.700 --> 03:30:16.100
of scottish v-tubers is if you genuinely like grew up around well like grew up around like normal

03:30:16.100 --> 03:30:22.100
friends uh you would genuinely be like bullied so hard like bully culture like in america and

03:30:22.100 --> 03:30:28.420
australia and the uk is so prevalent like if you show any enjoyment or being slightly different

03:30:28.420 --> 03:30:35.780
from the status quo you get sicked on like a like a hound like sick um it's crazy pour some

03:30:35.780 --> 03:30:42.340
zura milk on it honestly i don't know i can't remember how i cut myself my wee fingy i'm okay though

03:30:46.820 --> 03:30:52.340
someone says hi stroney i missed all of your livestreams rip but i do have a few questions

03:30:52.340 --> 03:30:57.620
what happens if one of the girls wants to leave they uh they leave question mark

03:30:58.740 --> 03:31:02.820
they get to go we don't have a non-compete uh i don't believe in them i don't think they're nice

03:31:02.820 --> 03:31:07.780
they are not kind if you no longer work for the vealer agency why would we prevent you from

03:31:07.780 --> 03:31:15.700
making money elsewhere that is uh called being uh messed up will you retire the character yeah

03:31:17.140 --> 03:31:23.300
also if you can work the plans for gen two will you bring in six new girls and retire the other

03:31:23.300 --> 03:31:27.780
what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what

03:31:29.060 --> 03:31:35.780
if gen two is the thing there will be six new girls on board um so well when feature agencies come

03:31:35.780 --> 03:31:41.700
out with generations uh everyone can be active at the same time it's not a problem so generation one

03:31:41.700 --> 03:31:46.500
all six active generation two all six active so that would be 12 total then if generation three

03:31:46.500 --> 03:31:51.780
and everyone's happy with their cuts and things are all nice and swimmingly and then generation

03:31:51.780 --> 03:32:00.260
three and there will be a total of 18 succubi and v-sucky wow i really that's very daunting to

03:32:00.260 --> 03:32:06.340
think of but thank god i'm not the script master anymore because if i was a script master i could

03:32:06.340 --> 03:32:15.300
not stream i genuinely could not stream um there are absolutely no interest for any generations

03:32:15.300 --> 03:32:22.180
after three no spin-off generations no secret plans no save for work generation

03:32:23.140 --> 03:32:30.420
none of that i and i am exhausted i took insane amounts of hp damage getting gen one out

03:32:31.220 --> 03:32:39.860
i am ill i want to get myself better and i'm going to stream and i'm going to enjoy every second of

03:32:39.860 --> 03:32:48.900
it um but yeah we we uh we are not having to retire gen one to get gen two out no um sorry

03:32:50.740 --> 03:32:54.580
lastly and this may be taboo to ask and if you don't i'll read it in my head

03:32:58.580 --> 03:33:01.460
that is controversial it's not controversial

03:33:01.700 --> 03:33:07.780

03:50:14.420 --> 03:50:17.060
don't want to get them on that silver

03:50:20.500 --> 03:50:21.700
oh he's staring around

03:50:24.180 --> 03:50:25.940

but they are giggling away and gonna start blushing right so take them and then go back

03:50:56.340 --> 03:51:00.420
to the fuel stack because i don't want to get in any trouble

03:51:00.420 --> 03:51:13.220
i think we just got 50% DNA so i think we might actually have

03:51:18.900 --> 03:51:25.940
i think we might actually have a new pristine memory unlock if it's 25 percent then 50 then 75

03:51:26.500 --> 03:51:30.020
that reason said then should we help

03:51:36.100 --> 03:51:37.380
i can't protect him

03:51:40.820 --> 03:51:46.180
speaking of smoking before to my friend lu you want to smoke go for it no nothing for me to say

03:51:46.580 --> 03:51:58.900
i'm trying so hard not to lose them to a guard right now i think we're okay with the render

03:51:58.900 --> 03:52:06.980
difference i have no idea what we're missing and not done yet we're replaying easy missions that

03:52:06.980 --> 03:52:12.260
i failed in order to get higher dna sequence christina's story doesn't unlock until you have

03:52:12.260 --> 03:52:17.300
high synchronicity so i'm having to go back and redo missions that like are easy and they'll

03:52:17.300 --> 03:52:22.100
raise our overall percentage and then we should be able to finish whatever happens with christina

03:52:22.100 --> 03:52:27.700
because it like ended and it didn't make any sense like at all

03:52:34.020 --> 03:52:37.140
right okay we're done this part we just need to do the benchmark night

03:52:37.220 --> 03:52:44.740
how far are you planning on taking vila or dominate no not domination i just want the girls to

03:52:45.380 --> 03:52:52.660
achieve their dreams and achieve what they want to do and um have a good time you know it's kind

03:52:52.660 --> 03:52:57.220
of like what are vila's dreams vila's dreams or whatever the girls dreams are because we want

03:52:57.300 --> 03:52:58.500
them to be happy

03:53:02.340 --> 03:53:05.060
interesting what about alcohol oh i can't have alcohol

03:53:06.340 --> 03:53:09.220
if you guys drink it's fine i'm gonna stop you um

03:53:10.420 --> 03:53:16.820
but yeah like uh alcohol and me don't go well um it speeds up my heart rate it makes me feel

03:53:16.820 --> 03:53:23.540
uncomfortable and i get i'm very late wait even though i'm Scottish i'm so freaking late wait it's

03:53:23.540 --> 03:53:26.500
so annoying i'm stinky like why

03:53:28.660 --> 03:53:35.780
um so i just can't really handle it i don't do it also there's been like tons of reports that come

03:53:35.780 --> 03:53:40.260
out where alcohol is really bad but i'm not gonna say no to like drunk karaoke streams or something

03:53:40.260 --> 03:53:53.380
like that um i kind of learned that um so when you feel a buzz from alcohol you don't have to drink

03:53:53.380 --> 03:53:58.100
any further than that point to keep the buzz going that's not how alcohol works i only recently

03:53:58.100 --> 03:54:06.580
learned that back anyway and but like i won't be shy of doing like drunk uh karaoke i'll drink for

03:54:06.580 --> 03:54:16.020
the both of us honestly there's less of you to fill alcohol with oh please please excuse me i'm

at the moment please remember to drink water if you do drink yes i do not want any issues

03:54:46.100 --> 03:54:51.700

03:55:18.500 --> 03:55:28.180
going out friends that go like um i'll like nightclub or rave or any of that which is where a

03:55:28.180 --> 03:55:35.140
lot of drinking culture comes into play in the uk um like the aim when you go out with your friends

03:55:35.140 --> 03:55:41.860
is to get like plastered which is like just not very pleasant um

03:55:43.860 --> 03:55:49.460
she has her own full plated armor if only we had a very strong kneecap

03:55:51.460 --> 03:55:55.140
sure would be a shame oh i did a challenge

03:55:57.620 --> 03:56:01.780
right let's do this without getting in trouble this time

03:56:02.660 --> 03:56:11.220

ah i have my friend group love getting hammered and half did not yeah like i didn't really

03:56:26.900 --> 03:56:30.820
experience any of that so it just never really became a thing

03:56:32.420 --> 03:56:35.860
and like obviously hang up right i definitely can do it this thing

03:56:36.740 --> 03:56:39.460
yeah okay easy easy hundred percent right there

03:56:43.220 --> 03:56:50.180
i visited the Disney driver on my 21st birthday oh that's right 21st day drinking age in

i'm going out or getting good at it it was going out or getting good at ac brotherhood

03:57:06.420 --> 03:57:12.740

03:57:12.740 --> 03:57:18.740
i just have no interest i have an interest in like doing like tipsy streams or like drunk

03:57:18.820 --> 03:57:21.060
review of movies okay

03:57:25.300 --> 03:57:25.860
not again

03:57:31.460 --> 03:57:36.180
did it twice i'm sure there's a freaking hay bale down there or something

03:57:37.460 --> 03:57:41.380
drinking with good family friends is probably me well you're getting hammered

03:57:41.380 --> 03:57:49.540
well you were out there getting hammered i was so out of the story himself right wait

03:57:49.540 --> 03:57:55.940
those missions only went up the sink to 51% so didn't you christina get unlocked at 50%

03:57:59.860 --> 03:58:00.260
oh

03:58:04.580 --> 03:58:07.140
what do you mean i've only done 50% of the game

03:58:12.020 --> 03:58:17.220
uh right those ones are difficult so i actually don't want to do them

03:58:18.660 --> 03:58:23.140
what's this one the baron de voir gatekeeper 50 50

03:58:24.820 --> 03:58:29.460
what are you don't lose any health squares

03:58:32.340 --> 03:58:35.780
okay this one's super easy we can do this one i'm literally doing it easiest to hard

03:58:36.740 --> 03:58:38.820
and then we'll get hard at the end

03:58:41.540 --> 03:58:44.900
how should i beat your first try and get glue sorry i need any sub saying that because it's not

03:58:44.900 --> 03:58:47.220
very nice because like i completely understand

03:58:51.140 --> 03:58:56.180
i did it again it makes that noise i think that must be an audio mistake or something because

03:59:00.900 --> 03:59:05.540
i was studying the hidden bleed i was such an assassin's creed fanboy

03:59:05.540 --> 03:59:11.380
i used to think it would be so cool if i got like the assassin's creed logo branded on my finger

03:59:12.020 --> 03:59:20.340
i was so impressionable as a child you're truly a man after my so impressionable not very smart

03:59:20.340 --> 03:59:23.860
it's kind of character i will get the armor my troops will gather it from the dead

03:59:23.860 --> 03:59:29.060
what's been streamed tomorrow is a needy streamer overload needy streamer over than that's you

03:59:29.060 --> 03:59:34.100
it's actually a pretty good tale for me to kill them without a fight the armor has to stay clean

03:59:34.100 --> 03:59:39.220
next small fish the ac logo in tattoo only refilling assassins allowed inside

03:59:41.460 --> 03:59:46.260
okay if this is just don't be actually well i am here

03:59:50.100 --> 03:59:55.220
no not while i'm here we have to do it outside of a mission no i always go that way and it's

03:59:55.220 --> 03:59:57.060
like the longest way to find anyone

04:00:06.580 --> 04:00:10.100
that's the good reason that young people can't get tattoos yes i would like to be

04:00:10.100 --> 04:00:14.340
sitting here with like a freaking branded fingers probably the sega logo on me at one point as well

04:00:14.340 --> 04:00:25.460
for um for don't get detected for um sonic heroes i always loved it when i was like

04:00:29.220 --> 04:00:34.180
did that not alert anyone they're actually so efficient at fighting that didn't alert anyone

04:00:35.940 --> 04:00:40.420
you guys get okay our assassins are pretty high level i'm pretty sure they can handle

04:00:40.420 --> 04:00:46.420
what's about to happen oh there's a patrol route oh there's a big old fight going on

04:00:48.100 --> 04:00:55.460
okay we're at five costumes they're still going for it whoa they're getting beaten up by the big guys

04:00:57.300 --> 04:01:02.820
oh they're they're fighting back they're beating them up four to two oh she lost the health bar

04:01:02.820 --> 04:01:07.220
wow i actually thought the uh oh they're going for this they're doing it they're doing it they're

04:01:07.220 --> 04:01:12.900
going for the patrolers as well oh we got 10 and that one that was that was a really good one

04:01:13.860 --> 04:01:16.660
uh what's over here another french patel thing

04:01:20.900 --> 04:01:25.540
when needy streamer overload okay uh i think that's definitely going to be a shorter stream

04:01:25.540 --> 04:01:30.100
however when i do have shorter streams i'm going to like be working on ASMR collabs and stuff so

04:01:30.100 --> 04:01:42.660
there's no homie more content coming america here can oh that's actually for two assassins to

04:01:42.660 --> 04:01:46.660
take on that big old group that's quite a lot yeah one of them just lost the health bit

04:01:48.420 --> 04:01:53.380
i actually think i'm gonna have to send in more assassins you know

04:01:54.580 --> 04:01:58.660
oh they've lost two health bars this is getting this is getting juicy this is getting juicy

04:01:58.660 --> 04:02:04.820

04:02:04.820 --> 04:02:09.940

04:02:09.940 --> 04:02:16.820
call in the next card there you go there you go oh i have no idea what's going on over there

04:02:16.820 --> 04:02:22.180

04:03:25.540 --> 04:03:32.740
i just need to not be discovered that's also i'm gonna wait to call in my assassins to do this

04:03:32.740 --> 04:03:36.020
i really don't want to actually only get caught i'll be annoyed at myself if i do

04:03:37.220 --> 04:03:39.220

04:03:42.100 --> 04:03:44.340

04:04:21.700 --> 04:04:29.220

04:04:29.220 --> 04:04:38.900
at you and that first one i'll try it do i plan on unlocking all the endings on needy streamer

04:04:38.900 --> 04:04:41.940
i don't know how much i'm gonna like it i'm gonna play it for the first time

04:04:42.660 --> 04:04:46.500
i think it's like a click game which honestly might make it super simple

04:04:47.140 --> 04:04:50.660
if i like it then i'll try and get all endings if i don't like it then i'll probably just do

04:04:50.660 --> 04:04:55.780
a few runs and then uh have a short stream and then i'll work on a smart that sounds like a deal

04:04:55.780 --> 04:05:01.460
that does not surprise me the french puttani have us under pressure tell me about their general

04:05:01.460 --> 04:05:10.980
these baron de valois some major is just like the option and over and over again where can i find

04:05:11.300 --> 04:05:17.220

in your ear

04:07:40.820 --> 04:07:44.100
i believe another lady might object to that

04:07:46.100 --> 04:07:50.660
didn't the developer also make another game a whale after

04:07:50.660 --> 04:07:58.660
come on down on your wife says no my downs and come out of the door

04:08:02.100 --> 04:08:04.180
that's practically your stretch

04:08:05.460 --> 04:08:09.140
all of Italy will be speaking it i'll get you

04:08:12.740 --> 04:08:14.580
yeah i can't speak none of that

04:08:14.580 --> 04:08:22.980
okay i think we just need to go back and forth and not get attacked by anything which is super

04:08:22.980 --> 04:08:24.980
simple

04:08:33.220 --> 04:08:34.980
maybe part of a 2.0

04:08:35.860 --> 04:08:37.220
why is your french so good no

04:08:48.100 --> 04:08:53.700
i actually don't know any french i'll literally no phrases and i record just hate the same phrases

04:08:54.260 --> 04:08:58.100
if you would like to order a ham and cheese baguette you say

04:08:59.060 --> 04:09:02.660
i would like a good ham with

04:09:04.740 --> 04:09:05.860
i forgot what cheese is

04:09:10.420 --> 04:09:13.380
well that didn't that didn't work out very well

04:09:17.620 --> 04:09:19.700
well it sounds good coming from my friend to speak up

04:09:19.860 --> 04:09:21.380
uh

04:09:27.060 --> 04:09:27.860
Oh wait that was

04:09:30.980 --> 04:09:32.420
must have french post word

04:09:32.420 --> 04:09:36.620
I enter and don't bear in gifts and hope that

04:09:36.620 --> 04:09:41.820
I can not see offensive of Rima, but did I say

04:09:41.820 --> 04:09:45.020
call your man back to the max. I will explain that.

04:09:45.020 --> 04:09:47.020
You better have something good.

04:09:47.020 --> 04:09:49.820
Hold back!

04:09:49.820 --> 04:09:52.420
Yeah, that's like, I'm literally just regurgitating.

04:09:52.420 --> 04:09:56.020
Do I have higher education? That sounds like I have higher education.

04:09:56.020 --> 04:09:58.020
That answers me.

04:09:58.020 --> 04:10:01.020
Reason a barn, uneducated in the barn.

04:10:02.020 --> 04:10:04.020
And became a gamer. Hell yeah.

04:10:08.420 --> 04:10:12.020
Ray, I'm a bit scared of this one.

04:10:12.020 --> 04:10:14.020
Don't lose any health squares.

04:10:17.020 --> 04:10:20.020
I actually don't want to do that one because it takes too long.

04:10:20.020 --> 04:10:26.020
Ray, we're at 52%. So every time I do a memory, I'm getting like, up to 5%.

04:10:26.020 --> 04:10:29.020
Use assassin recruits to do your targets.

04:10:29.020 --> 04:10:35.020
Okay, we're actually, factually going to upgrade our assassin recruits.

04:10:35.020 --> 04:10:40.020
Which, sorry, I just closed this, but we actually needed to open it.

04:10:40.020 --> 04:10:44.020
If I do this, they get...

04:10:44.020 --> 04:10:47.020
Okay, we just need to send them on missions.

04:10:47.020 --> 04:10:55.020
If we get 5 assassins level 10, the assassin's recruit signal replenishes so much faster.

04:10:55.020 --> 04:11:02.020
I think it takes off like 20 seconds, which, in the grand scheme of things, adds up so quickly.

04:11:02.020 --> 04:11:04.020
How much money do I have on my assassins?

04:11:06.020 --> 04:11:08.020
13k, right, I don't have enough right.

04:11:08.020 --> 04:11:10.020
We'll just go and do...

04:11:10.020 --> 04:11:13.020
We'll send them on missions.

04:11:14.020 --> 04:11:16.020
By the P-jones.

04:11:16.020 --> 04:11:18.020
Oh, it was like, dead ahead, dead center.

04:11:19.020 --> 04:11:22.020
I remembered an Italian swear. I'll use anything.

04:11:22.020 --> 04:11:24.020
Show us your thrones!

04:11:25.020 --> 04:11:27.020
I didn't even know that.

04:11:27.020 --> 04:11:28.020
I know, cazzo!

04:11:30.020 --> 04:11:32.020
Oh, we put 50 grand in the bank?

04:11:33.020 --> 04:11:34.020
50 smacaroons.

04:11:34.020 --> 04:11:37.020
Right, we're going to send away our agents.

04:11:37.020 --> 04:11:41.020
Because I want some of them to level up so then we can get faster.

04:11:44.020 --> 04:11:46.020
I have no one at 10 yet.

04:11:46.020 --> 04:11:48.020
What, how are you guys...

04:11:48.020 --> 04:11:50.020
Oh, you're getting close!

04:11:50.020 --> 04:11:52.020
Right, I just need to send them away.

04:11:52.020 --> 04:11:55.020
Maybe do a mission that doesn't require them.

04:11:56.020 --> 04:11:58.020
And then we can get that...

04:12:01.020 --> 04:12:04.020
5, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

04:12:04.020 --> 04:12:06.020
If you guys all go...

04:12:07.020 --> 04:12:09.020
I think...

04:12:09.020 --> 04:12:11.020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

04:12:11.020 --> 04:12:13.020
Oh, I don't want to risk the room.

04:12:13.020 --> 04:12:18.020
If it fails, I'm like 99% sure they come back all perished.

04:12:18.020 --> 04:12:21.020
If it fails, which is like, pretty unforgiven.

04:12:23.020 --> 04:12:24.020
Eh...

04:12:24.020 --> 04:12:28.020
Honestly, your openness and no manners is one of the reasons why I like...

04:12:30.020 --> 04:12:32.020
That's funny.

04:12:32.020 --> 04:12:34.020
When I live at Cleveland.

04:12:35.020 --> 04:12:36.020
Eh...

04:12:36.020 --> 04:12:37.020
Right.

04:12:37.020 --> 04:12:39.020
Missions, missions, missions.

04:12:39.020 --> 04:12:41.020
Wait, they don't have...

04:12:42.020 --> 04:12:45.020
17 minutes for that mission?

04:12:45.020 --> 04:12:47.020
Is really not.

04:12:47.020 --> 04:12:51.020
Is there not another level 5 regular contract?

04:12:53.020 --> 04:12:54.020
There's no...

04:12:54.020 --> 04:12:56.020
Oh, these are all level 5s.

04:12:56.020 --> 04:12:57.020
Okay.

04:12:57.020 --> 04:12:59.020
All four of you go together.

04:13:00.020 --> 04:13:02.020
And you're humble, little thing.

04:13:05.020 --> 04:13:07.020
Alright, as an Italian myself,

04:13:07.020 --> 04:13:10.020
I have to say here in the dub for Italian phrases another...

04:13:10.020 --> 04:13:12.020
Languages is cringe!

04:13:12.020 --> 04:13:14.020
Oh, you don't want to hear me say...

04:13:14.020 --> 04:13:16.020
Spinji, spinji!

04:13:16.020 --> 04:13:18.020
Aiuto, aiuto!

04:13:18.020 --> 04:13:20.020
Aius mius!

04:13:20.020 --> 04:13:22.020
Wait, no, that's Spanish.

04:13:23.020 --> 04:13:25.020
Alright, we're going to go to a bank.

04:13:35.020 --> 04:13:37.020
As an Italian myself, please say more Italian words.

04:13:37.020 --> 04:13:39.020
Ai, ai, ai, aius mius!

04:13:41.020 --> 04:13:43.020
To say...

04:13:44.020 --> 04:13:46.020
I don't think I have any Italian words.

04:13:47.020 --> 04:13:50.020
I'm ready for a little nap after eating almost this little snack.

04:13:50.020 --> 04:13:52.020
I still have pea snacks left over.

04:13:52.020 --> 04:13:54.020
I forgot to eat any of my reasons.

04:13:54.020 --> 04:13:56.020
I'm going to have to put them back in the fridge.

04:13:56.020 --> 04:13:58.020
I need to buy paintings.

04:13:58.020 --> 04:14:00.020
Wait, do paintings?

04:14:00.020 --> 04:14:02.020
Question mark, go to DNA.

04:14:04.020 --> 04:14:07.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:07.020 --> 04:14:08.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:08.020 --> 04:14:09.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:09.020 --> 04:14:10.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:10.020 --> 04:14:11.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:11.020 --> 04:14:12.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:12.020 --> 04:14:13.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:13.020 --> 04:14:14.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:14.020 --> 04:14:15.020
52, 4, 7.

04:14:18.020 --> 04:14:20.020
I just spent all my money on that then.

04:14:20.020 --> 04:14:22.020
Oh, excuse me, you're in my way.

04:14:33.020 --> 04:14:36.020
I just need to access the bank over here.

04:14:36.020 --> 04:14:39.020
I don't mind getting a little wet, why not?

04:14:44.020 --> 04:14:46.020
That's my favourite food.

04:14:46.020 --> 04:14:48.020
Chatting, has to be chicken.

04:14:49.020 --> 04:14:51.020
It's too tasty, I don't know, I just did something.

04:14:51.020 --> 04:14:54.020
I like savoury foods over sweet foods.

04:14:56.020 --> 04:14:58.020
Savory is just dab on.

04:15:00.020 --> 04:15:02.020
Flags, feathers and chest.

04:15:02.020 --> 04:15:06.020
Do they, do flags go to the percentage?

04:15:06.020 --> 04:15:09.020
Because I feel like the DNA sequence doesn't, is like so...

04:15:10.020 --> 04:15:12.020
Rough, colonel standards.

04:15:12.020 --> 04:15:14.020
I can't do that, just do it.

04:15:17.020 --> 04:15:18.020
Don't be detected.

04:15:18.020 --> 04:15:19.020
Like, I don't like to...

04:15:21.020 --> 04:15:24.020
Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.

04:15:25.020 --> 04:15:27.020
How did I do that?

04:15:28.020 --> 04:15:30.020
Because they're all attacking you.

04:15:33.020 --> 04:15:36.020
Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.

04:15:39.020 --> 04:15:41.020
Beat chaserie to the apple of Eden, don't hurt anyone.

04:15:48.020 --> 04:15:50.020
I have my hand over my mouth thinking.

04:15:50.020 --> 04:15:52.020
Oh, I don't have any smoke bombs!

04:15:56.020 --> 04:15:59.020
I don't have any smoke bombs on my person, so I can't get rid of that.

04:15:59.020 --> 04:16:01.020
Fried, oh, fried by far.

04:16:01.020 --> 04:16:03.020
I don't have any smoke bombs on my person, so I can't get rid of that.

04:16:06.020 --> 04:16:07.020
Yeah, for sure, would you?

04:16:07.020 --> 04:16:09.020
Like, if you heard Nataline speak your navel image.

04:16:09.020 --> 04:16:13.020
Sure, it might not be some bad, but you know, the accent can pack a punch.

04:16:24.020 --> 04:16:26.020
The layers of Romeo, the war machine.

04:16:26.020 --> 04:16:27.020
The war machine.

04:16:30.020 --> 04:16:32.020
Wait, do these have a percentage?

04:16:35.020 --> 04:16:37.020
No, these don't have a percentage.

04:16:44.020 --> 04:16:46.020
Okay, this is why our thing is so low.

04:16:49.020 --> 04:16:53.020
Okay, okay, we're gonna do Assassin's contracts, wherever the heck they are.

04:16:53.020 --> 04:16:55.020
That's why the freaking percentage is so low.

04:16:57.020 --> 04:17:01.020
These symbols, the pigeon groups?

04:17:02.020 --> 04:17:05.020
Like, these ones, is it that?

04:17:05.020 --> 04:17:07.020
Assassin's contract, right, okay, okay.

04:17:08.020 --> 04:17:13.020
I was gonna say, because it's not making a lot of sense why the percentage is so low.

04:17:13.020 --> 04:17:16.020
There's only a few missions that I haven't done 100% on.

04:17:17.020 --> 04:17:22.020
I'm gonna be honest, and I don't think we're gonna 100% it,

04:17:22.020 --> 04:17:25.020
but we definitely finished the game and I'm satisfied.

04:17:26.020 --> 04:17:31.020
After the stream, we don't need to hop back on Black Ops on Brotherhood.

04:17:35.020 --> 04:17:39.020
Because I'm satisfied with the playthrough.

04:17:41.020 --> 04:17:44.020
Because I don't actually have much faith.

04:17:44.020 --> 04:17:48.020
Okay, so I just need to kind of do all the black markers on the map, really.

04:17:48.020 --> 04:17:54.020
Maybe factions also, half of it, if I get 100% favor in the factions as well.

04:17:57.020 --> 04:17:59.020
KFC Yummi, honestly.

04:18:02.020 --> 04:18:04.020
It's been very cozy.

04:18:04.020 --> 04:18:06.020
It's more of a cozy day, I think.

04:18:06.020 --> 04:18:09.020
Yesterday, I used up a lot of my energy on our replay.

04:18:09.020 --> 04:18:12.020
Just being gushed in about this game and being like,

04:18:12.020 --> 04:18:14.020
it's getting so cool, it's getting so awesome.

04:18:15.020 --> 04:18:17.020
Today, it's definitely cozy.

04:18:17.020 --> 04:18:20.020
It's definitely have a little blanky on you, make sure you're comfy vibes.

04:18:21.020 --> 04:18:26.020
Yesterday, I was screaming my head off, just loving everything.

04:18:26.020 --> 04:18:28.020
So energetic.

04:18:28.020 --> 04:18:31.020
But I get to be like that unapologetically,

04:18:31.020 --> 04:18:36.020
because nothing's worse than being excited for something,

04:18:36.020 --> 04:18:40.020
and then someone's like, you're being really loud and obnoxious.

04:18:40.020 --> 04:18:41.020
They're just like kills.

04:18:41.020 --> 04:18:44.020
Oh, that's what I mean, I'm having such a good time.

04:18:44.020 --> 04:18:47.020
You never met someone who's genuinely excited before?

04:18:48.020 --> 04:18:54.020
Yes, faction challenges are also part of the peer-centered contract.

04:18:54.020 --> 04:18:56.020
No, not that contract.

04:18:56.020 --> 04:18:58.020
Mission.

04:19:01.020 --> 04:19:04.020
Chesery hopes that our rebels will stumble into his line of fire

04:19:04.020 --> 04:19:07.020
who's expected to come and wait and structure the...

04:19:07.020 --> 04:19:09.020
kill the three targets in two minutes.

04:19:09.020 --> 04:19:14.020
Oh my god, these have freaking things as well.

04:19:15.020 --> 04:19:17.020
Oh.

04:19:17.020 --> 04:19:22.020
Okay, I'm starting to understand why our DNA, I think, is so unbelievably low.

04:19:33.020 --> 04:19:36.020
Oh, he's just out of range and no more.

04:19:38.020 --> 04:19:41.020
Wait, under three minutes.

04:19:41.020 --> 04:19:43.020
Three gunmen and under...

04:19:45.020 --> 04:19:47.020
They're not that far away.

04:19:47.020 --> 04:19:50.020
Okay, I guess the assassin's contracts are super nice,

04:19:50.020 --> 04:19:53.020
because this guy's not that far away.

04:19:53.020 --> 04:19:56.020
Oh, that was super reasonable.

04:20:02.020 --> 04:20:04.020
Oh, I can't reach that.

04:20:09.020 --> 04:20:11.020
Eh, that quick.

04:20:12.020 --> 04:20:14.020
Okay, I was like...

04:20:14.020 --> 04:20:17.020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow, ow, ow.

04:20:17.020 --> 04:20:19.020
Me ankles.

04:20:19.020 --> 04:20:21.020
I'm out of medicine.

04:20:21.020 --> 04:20:23.020
Ugh, and smoke worms.

04:20:24.020 --> 04:20:27.020
Oh, there's a doctor over here, that's perfect.

04:20:35.020 --> 04:20:37.020
What was out of medicine?

04:20:38.020 --> 04:20:42.020
See, the thing is, I don't look soldiers' bodies,

04:20:42.020 --> 04:20:44.020
so I don't get anything from them.

04:20:44.020 --> 04:20:47.020
Heal me, you should heal myself, no.

04:20:50.020 --> 04:20:51.020
Sure.

04:20:51.020 --> 04:20:53.020
Do the feathers count as DNA?

04:20:53.020 --> 04:20:55.020
Oh, possibly.

04:20:56.020 --> 04:20:58.020
You don't need ankles.

04:20:58.020 --> 04:21:03.020
Right, so literally just do the pigeon coops and then it's going up.

04:21:03.020 --> 04:21:05.020
Oh yeah, 53%.

04:21:05.020 --> 04:21:08.020
Okay, okay, okay, okay, let him get up, let him get up.

04:21:08.020 --> 04:21:10.020
53%, how do I go up there?

04:21:11.020 --> 04:21:13.020
That looks like a hell to me.

04:21:13.020 --> 04:21:16.020
That looks like a bit of an enslave, a bit of an incline.

04:21:23.020 --> 04:21:28.020
Eh, I think tomorrow I'm going to save.

04:21:28.020 --> 04:21:31.020
Which means I need to take a shower.

04:21:31.020 --> 04:21:33.020
Put deodorant on.

04:21:33.020 --> 04:21:37.020
I need to pretend I'm a normal person.

04:21:37.020 --> 04:21:39.020
I'm teasing.

04:21:39.020 --> 04:21:41.020
I do not stink all the time.

04:21:41.020 --> 04:21:43.020
Wait, what was 100%?

04:21:43.020 --> 04:21:45.020
Assassinate three guards with a hidden blade.

04:21:45.020 --> 04:21:49.020
You do not have to tell me anything more, I assure you.

04:21:49.020 --> 04:21:51.020
Hidden blade is a way to go.

04:21:57.020 --> 04:22:01.020
Oh, they're on horsies.

04:22:01.020 --> 04:22:03.020
I love when they're on horsies.

04:22:03.020 --> 04:22:06.020
Hello, would you like to die?

04:22:06.020 --> 04:22:08.020
Okay, hold on, let me try the game.

04:22:08.020 --> 04:22:10.020
Would you like to die?

04:22:10.020 --> 04:22:12.020
One.

04:22:12.020 --> 04:22:13.020
They're all on horses.

04:22:13.020 --> 04:22:16.020
No wonder the game's like, they're all on horses.

04:22:16.020 --> 04:22:19.020
How am I supposed to do this?

04:22:19.020 --> 04:22:21.020
Hello, would you like to die?

04:22:21.020 --> 04:22:22.020
Hello, would you like to die?

04:22:22.020 --> 04:22:23.020
No.

04:22:23.020 --> 04:22:25.020
Yes, wait, I did it.

04:22:25.020 --> 04:22:26.020
100% already.

04:22:26.020 --> 04:22:27.020
Skill?

04:22:27.020 --> 04:22:28.020
Okay, wait, wait, hold on.

04:22:28.020 --> 04:22:30.020
It's fine, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic, don't panic.

04:22:30.020 --> 04:22:31.020
Let him get up, let him get up.

04:22:31.020 --> 04:22:34.020
Oh, no, no, no, don't spank the horse.

04:22:34.020 --> 04:22:37.020
Wait, wait, wait, get him, because he's got a bow.

04:22:37.020 --> 04:22:38.020
Why does it not...

04:22:38.020 --> 04:22:40.020
Do I need to like jump up onto the horse?

04:22:43.020 --> 04:22:46.020
Ow, you're hurting me.

04:22:46.020 --> 04:22:47.020
Okay.

04:22:47.020 --> 04:22:49.020
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:22:49.020 --> 04:22:50.020
Let them cook, let them cook.

04:22:50.020 --> 04:22:52.020
Yes, they got off the horse by automatic.

04:22:54.020 --> 04:22:56.020
Okay, easy peasy lemon smoothie.

04:22:56.020 --> 04:22:57.020
You're next.

04:22:57.020 --> 04:22:59.020
No, you're not.

04:22:59.020 --> 04:23:00.020
Are you coming?

04:23:00.020 --> 04:23:01.020
I've lost sight of him.

04:23:01.020 --> 04:23:02.020
Are you coming?

04:23:02.020 --> 04:23:03.020
Yes, there, get him.

04:23:03.020 --> 04:23:04.020
3, 2, 1.

04:23:04.020 --> 04:23:05.020
Oh, I missed it, I missed it.

04:23:05.020 --> 04:23:06.020
I missed the timing source.

04:23:08.020 --> 04:23:11.020
I sniffed for you too late.

04:23:11.020 --> 04:23:13.020
Well, the weather's nicer for you.

04:23:13.020 --> 04:23:14.020
It's mild.

04:23:14.020 --> 04:23:16.020
33 degrees.

04:23:16.020 --> 04:23:21.020
It's too much for me.

04:23:21.020 --> 04:23:22.020
I'll pass.

04:23:22.020 --> 04:23:25.020
Right, I guess we're gonna do Leonardo as well.

04:23:25.020 --> 04:23:29.020
Oh, right, there's another one.

04:23:29.020 --> 04:23:33.020
If we do that, the assassin missions seem like super fair.

04:23:33.020 --> 04:23:36.020
Some of it buys for them right now.

04:23:36.020 --> 04:23:41.020
And we can generate more money by sending our wee assassins to get more XP.

04:23:41.020 --> 04:23:43.020
Oh, I'm gonna need a horse for this.

04:23:44.020 --> 04:23:46.020
I said I'm gonna need a...

04:23:46.020 --> 04:23:47.020
Wait, I'm blind.

04:23:47.020 --> 04:23:49.020
I just passed off on the horse.

04:23:49.020 --> 04:23:51.020
Sorry mate, my apologies.

04:23:56.020 --> 04:23:59.020
If it's super easy to do the assassin contracts, we'll just do them.

04:23:59.020 --> 04:24:01.020
Get them out of the way and then...

04:24:01.020 --> 04:24:05.020
Hopefully that's like our percentage raised by like 5.

04:24:05.020 --> 04:24:07.020
That's pretty good.

04:24:11.020 --> 04:24:16.020
Actually, I could also use these mercenaries.

04:24:16.020 --> 04:24:18.020
Well, I can't right now.

04:24:20.020 --> 04:24:22.020
Hello chat, hello.

04:24:22.020 --> 04:24:26.020
We're just trying to do what we can.

04:24:26.020 --> 04:24:30.020
It's very unlikely we're gonna 100% it, but I'm enjoying myself thoroughly.

04:24:30.020 --> 04:24:34.020
I'm actually gonna go get a blanket because I'm putting my legs on the table

04:24:34.020 --> 04:24:36.020
and I'm killing circulation to my leg.

04:24:36.020 --> 04:24:37.020
I'll just be a second.

04:24:37.020 --> 04:24:39.020
I don't need to mute so you can...

04:24:39.020 --> 04:24:42.020
What's that saying that's like, I love...

04:24:42.020 --> 04:24:45.020
I hate to see you go, but I'd love to watch you leave or something like that.

04:24:52.020 --> 04:24:53.020
Okay.

04:25:08.020 --> 04:25:11.020
I'm returned already.

04:25:12.020 --> 04:25:15.020
I'm gonna have my lovely blanket to protect my leg

04:25:15.020 --> 04:25:19.020
because my circulation is dying because I pressed them so hard against the table.

04:25:19.020 --> 04:25:21.020
They ain't sitting on my feet.

04:25:21.020 --> 04:25:23.020
I'm cutting the circulation out of my leg.

04:25:28.020 --> 04:25:31.020
All right, my chair is like so quicky.

04:25:35.020 --> 04:25:37.020
Right, have we got any level 10?

04:25:37.020 --> 04:25:40.020
No, we don't. It was a smaller mission.

04:25:44.020 --> 04:25:46.020
I screenshot that.

04:25:49.020 --> 04:25:51.020
That's an interesting scene.

04:25:52.020 --> 04:25:55.020
I'm supposed to close my eyes before I leave.

04:25:55.020 --> 04:26:00.020
So the thing looks right, but I don't think there's a soul here.

04:26:00.020 --> 04:26:04.020
I'm just gonna keep sending people away to do more.

04:26:04.020 --> 04:26:06.020
Oh wait, I'm a dumb dumb.

04:26:06.020 --> 04:26:10.020
I was supposed to accept a assassination contract.

04:26:10.020 --> 04:26:12.020
Missions.

04:26:14.020 --> 04:26:15.020
Choose company.

04:26:15.020 --> 04:26:17.020
Kill both targets for your hidden belief.

04:26:17.020 --> 04:26:20.020
You do not have to tell me twice.

04:26:20.020 --> 04:26:23.020
I'm loving these assassin missions.

04:26:23.020 --> 04:26:25.020
Are you joking me?

04:26:27.020 --> 04:26:30.020
I assume I don't have to get on a horse to reach them.

04:26:32.020 --> 04:26:34.020
Where are we getting pretty far?

04:26:37.020 --> 04:26:40.020
I can't tell which one's closer.

04:26:42.020 --> 04:26:44.020
Eh, where is this?

04:26:45.020 --> 04:26:47.020
Oh wow, they're like...

04:26:49.020 --> 04:26:51.020
Let's do that.

04:26:52.020 --> 04:26:55.020
By Austria and Switzerland, it's 26 right now.

04:26:59.020 --> 04:27:02.020
Literally, the assassin missions are so easy.

04:27:02.020 --> 04:27:07.020
We may be 57% once by the time we finish them.

04:27:07.020 --> 04:27:10.020
If they make them this easy, then...

04:27:15.020 --> 04:27:19.020
If you die, your assassin role before promoting them at max,

04:27:19.020 --> 04:27:22.020
their cape match will be that colour.

04:27:22.020 --> 04:27:24.020
I have no sense of colour.

04:27:26.020 --> 04:27:28.020
Wait, that...

04:27:29.020 --> 04:27:31.020
Assassin contracts are so easy!

04:27:31.020 --> 04:27:33.020
I love it here!

04:27:33.020 --> 04:27:34.020
What the heck?

04:27:34.020 --> 04:27:39.020
Don't be detected and there's 18 billion guards looking at you.

04:27:39.020 --> 04:27:41.020
Shout out to assassin contracts.

04:27:41.020 --> 04:27:43.020
Hello?

04:27:43.020 --> 04:27:46.020
I can't believe how easy these are!

04:27:49.020 --> 04:27:51.020
Excuse me, Mr. Horsey.

04:27:51.020 --> 04:27:53.020
Yet, in Maui.

04:27:53.020 --> 04:27:55.020
6 and 8% finish.

04:27:55.020 --> 04:27:57.020
Is that where we'll end on 6 and 8%?

04:27:57.020 --> 04:28:00.020
I'll give the Leonardo missions a go.

04:28:05.020 --> 04:28:09.020
It would be nice if 100%, but my goodness, I didn't know.

04:28:10.020 --> 04:28:13.020
I'll see what happens by the end of this stream.

04:28:13.020 --> 04:28:16.020
I thought I was only going to do 6 hours today.

04:28:16.020 --> 04:28:17.020
Hi.

04:28:17.020 --> 04:28:18.020
I'm sorry.

04:28:18.020 --> 04:28:19.020
Bye.

04:28:19.020 --> 04:28:21.020
It was nice meeting you.

04:28:23.020 --> 04:28:25.020
What percentage are we on?

04:28:25.020 --> 04:28:26.020
54?

04:28:27.020 --> 04:28:28.020
55!

04:28:28.020 --> 04:28:29.020
I love it here!

04:28:29.020 --> 04:28:30.020
It says 55.

04:28:30.020 --> 04:28:32.020
Oh my god, more contact please.

04:28:32.020 --> 04:28:33.020
They're so easy.

04:28:33.020 --> 04:28:35.020
Is there any more?

04:28:36.020 --> 04:28:40.020
No, but there's Templar Agents.

04:28:40.020 --> 04:28:42.020
Okay, we're going to do Templar Agents.

04:28:42.020 --> 04:28:47.020
I'm totally not stalling on the Leonardo missions because I know they're a bit tricky.

04:28:52.020 --> 04:28:54.020
Last Christina needs 75%.

04:28:54.020 --> 04:28:56.020
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:28:56.020 --> 04:28:57.020
We're going to do that.

04:28:57.020 --> 04:28:58.020
We're going to do it.

04:28:58.020 --> 04:29:04.020
I mean, honestly, it might be one of those things where I'm like, we'll do what we can.

04:29:04.020 --> 04:29:09.020
I actually don't know how long we're going to stream today.

04:29:09.020 --> 04:29:17.020
As I said, I was only planning on doing 6 hours-ish, but I mean, we're already getting close to that mark.

04:29:19.020 --> 04:29:25.020
It's already been 4 hours and a half, and I'm like, I don't really feel like I'm out of stamina right now for stream.

04:29:25.020 --> 04:29:34.020
Especially tomorrow, depending on how much I like the game, it might only be a tour stream, which is a bit meh.

04:29:36.020 --> 04:29:38.020
I believe in a thing called love.

04:29:38.020 --> 04:29:40.020
Just listen to the rhythm of your heart.

04:29:40.020 --> 04:29:54.020
Yeah, literally, it may be one of those things where I end up actually getting so close that we do just go-

04:29:54.020 --> 04:29:56.020
Oh wait, the bank, I can collect money from it.

04:30:00.020 --> 04:30:02.020
Oh no, I've already collected my money.

04:30:03.020 --> 04:30:17.020
I suppose once we buy the last, how do you call them, touristic locations, then we'll shall.

04:30:20.020 --> 04:30:23.020
I'm trying to do the faction challenges on the way there.

04:30:23.020 --> 04:30:28.020
Yeah, I need to hire thieves to lure people away.

04:30:28.020 --> 04:30:31.020
You need to do it 10 times to their question.

04:30:32.020 --> 04:30:35.020
I just need to find enemies.

04:30:40.020 --> 04:30:41.020
Yeah, just like that.

04:30:44.020 --> 04:30:46.020
We need to complete Christina!

04:30:46.020 --> 04:30:47.020
Literally.

04:30:48.020 --> 04:30:50.020
Right, what's this? Hi!

04:30:50.020 --> 04:30:51.020
Are you a kitty?

04:30:51.020 --> 04:30:53.020
Oh, it's not looking good.

04:30:55.020 --> 04:30:56.020
She's beating up!

04:31:01.020 --> 04:31:03.020
I will not touch you. What happened here?

04:31:03.020 --> 04:31:09.020
Auguste, my beloved husband, he owns this neighborhood.

04:31:09.020 --> 04:31:11.020
That Borgia have given it to him.

04:31:11.020 --> 04:31:19.020
He once made signs for the shop's nudistic, but now he post lies for the Borgia and hurts those who stand in his way.

04:31:19.020 --> 04:31:22.020
Like you, where is he?

04:31:22.020 --> 04:31:27.020
He spends his days locked in his workshop, but I may know how to go them out.

04:31:27.020 --> 04:31:29.020
What are we doing?

04:31:29.020 --> 04:31:30.020
Kill your target with the hidden bl-

04:31:30.020 --> 04:31:33.020
I love these missions, what the heck?

04:31:35.020 --> 04:31:36.020
Aw, that's so easy.

04:31:36.020 --> 04:31:38.020
Yesterday you said 8 hours and then end up being 12.

04:31:38.020 --> 04:31:40.020
It would have been 14.

04:31:41.020 --> 04:31:44.020
I don't know, maybe one day they'll fix the VOD issue.

04:31:44.020 --> 04:31:54.020
If the day comes where they fix that VOD issue, please let me know because it is over for your sleep schedule.

04:31:54.020 --> 04:32:00.020
I'm talking, we wake up, we brush our teeth, we get our food, and then we stream.

04:32:00.020 --> 04:32:02.020
14 hours, put a vidyag in.

04:32:02.020 --> 04:32:04.020
Wait, what am I supposed to do?

04:32:06.020 --> 04:32:07.020
What?

04:32:07.020 --> 04:32:08.020
Him!

04:32:10.020 --> 04:32:12.020
Wait, it's the doctor? What am I supposed to do?

04:32:12.020 --> 04:32:14.020
Oh no, it's the sign!

04:32:15.020 --> 04:32:16.020
Interact.

04:32:17.020 --> 04:32:21.020
Oh, we're pulling down propaganda, my apologies.

04:32:21.020 --> 04:32:23.020
I didn't know.

04:32:25.020 --> 04:32:27.020
Can you at least reserve the weekends, yeah?

04:32:27.020 --> 04:32:29.020
Aw, you needing a break from my stamina?

04:32:29.020 --> 04:32:31.020
You're so adorable, refling.

04:32:31.020 --> 04:32:33.020
There's no breaks on this tree.

04:32:34.020 --> 04:32:36.020
I was gonna say something else there, right?

04:32:36.020 --> 04:32:38.020
I was really bad shouldn't have fallen out.

04:32:38.020 --> 04:32:40.020
I'm not even naughty.

04:32:41.020 --> 04:32:45.020
Alright, we're pulling down propaganda, it's useless posters.

04:32:46.020 --> 04:32:49.020
Sleep is already ruined, what's a lot more ruined?

04:32:49.020 --> 04:32:50.020
Choo choo.

04:32:52.020 --> 04:32:54.020
Japanese man drained me.

04:32:57.020 --> 04:32:59.020
I like them trying to do this.

04:33:00.020 --> 04:33:07.020
Obviously they did the poster grabbing thing when you got no variety, but I didn't realise they reused it.

04:33:07.020 --> 04:33:11.020
I quite like the concept, because obviously whenever you think of the past, you're like,

04:33:11.020 --> 04:33:14.020
how did all these people even get caught for crimes?

04:33:14.020 --> 04:33:16.020
It just seems so...

04:33:17.020 --> 04:33:20.020
Kill your target within a move.

04:33:21.020 --> 04:33:24.020
Can I rip it down or are they gonna be mad at me?

04:33:24.020 --> 04:33:27.020
Okay, that's exactly odd-up smoke bombs.

04:33:30.020 --> 04:33:32.020
I'll just do that then.

04:33:32.020 --> 04:33:33.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:33:33.020 --> 04:33:34.020
I wasn't even...

04:33:34.020 --> 04:33:36.020
Yeah, see that's what I get annoyed with.

04:33:36.020 --> 04:33:39.020
If you don't enter combat before they whack you, you can't counter.

04:33:39.020 --> 04:33:42.020
And I literally can't do a boom-boom, but here we go.

04:33:42.020 --> 04:33:45.020
I might be able to get a smoke bomb off of this guy if I loot him,

04:33:45.020 --> 04:33:48.020
which I would actually really appreciate in case...

04:33:50.020 --> 04:33:51.020
Ancient Rome graffiti was here.

04:33:51.020 --> 04:33:52.020
There was a Pompey.

04:33:52.020 --> 04:33:53.020
We're at...

04:33:53.020 --> 04:33:54.020
Oh, yes, he does give me a smoke bomb.

04:33:54.020 --> 04:33:55.020
That was lucky.

04:33:56.020 --> 04:33:58.020
I'll definitely try and remember to...

04:33:58.020 --> 04:33:59.020
Oh, anti-drops!

04:33:59.020 --> 04:34:01.020
The other guy drops smoke bomb too?

04:34:01.020 --> 04:34:02.020
I don't know.

04:34:05.020 --> 04:34:08.020
So when we pull this down, I assume we get to meet the guy,

04:34:08.020 --> 04:34:10.020
and then we...

04:34:10.020 --> 04:34:12.020
Oh, we lure him out of his workshop

04:34:12.020 --> 04:34:14.020
because we've filled all those posters down.

04:34:14.020 --> 04:34:15.020
Okay.

04:34:16.020 --> 04:34:18.020
We can definitely do...

04:34:20.020 --> 04:34:22.020
Other fanbases be looking at refills

04:34:22.020 --> 04:34:23.020
like a man dying of dehydration.

04:34:23.020 --> 04:34:25.020
Watch another man drowning!

04:34:25.020 --> 04:34:27.020
That is so good.

04:34:27.020 --> 04:34:28.020
What?

04:34:28.020 --> 04:34:29.020
I predict.

04:34:30.020 --> 04:34:32.020
I'll friggin' just say I've got Santa Man now.

04:34:34.020 --> 04:34:35.020
I'm actually...

04:34:35.020 --> 04:34:37.020
At least he well in this house.

04:34:38.020 --> 04:34:40.020
I do feel bad when people have a streamer

04:34:40.020 --> 04:34:42.020
that maybe struggles to stream.

04:34:43.020 --> 04:34:45.020
I know, I just find that a really good time.

04:34:45.020 --> 04:34:46.020
A good time!

04:34:48.020 --> 04:34:49.020
Is that a multiplayer character?

04:34:49.020 --> 04:34:50.020
It kind of looks like it.

04:34:50.020 --> 04:34:51.020
It might actually be.

04:34:53.020 --> 04:34:54.020
If it is,

04:34:54.020 --> 04:34:57.020
then that's another compliment to the game

04:34:57.020 --> 04:34:59.020
would be on how they incorporated

04:34:59.020 --> 04:35:03.020
multiplayer characters into the game campaign.

04:35:04.020 --> 04:35:05.020
I feel like...

04:35:06.020 --> 04:35:08.020
Drowning is standing in this house.

04:35:09.020 --> 04:35:10.020
Wait, did I not say that?

04:35:10.020 --> 04:35:12.020
Did you ever play the multiplayer for this game?

04:35:12.020 --> 04:35:17.020
I don't really think so.

04:35:18.020 --> 04:35:20.020
I think I was aware of it.

04:35:20.020 --> 04:35:21.020
56%?!

04:35:21.020 --> 04:35:22.020
Okay, hold on.

04:35:22.020 --> 04:35:24.020
I'm starting to have hope.

04:35:25.020 --> 04:35:27.020
I'm starting to have mild hope.

04:35:27.020 --> 04:35:29.020
I don't want to get anyone's...

04:35:30.020 --> 04:35:33.020
I don't want to lead to anyone on,

04:35:34.020 --> 04:35:37.020
but it might be possible.

04:35:37.020 --> 04:35:41.020
It might be for the 100% run.

04:35:43.020 --> 04:35:46.020
Because that's going up way faster now that we're...

04:35:46.020 --> 04:35:48.020
Sorry, I should be riding horse right now.

04:35:50.020 --> 04:35:52.020
Because literally I was so confused

04:35:52.020 --> 04:35:55.020
why the percentage was so low.

04:35:55.020 --> 04:35:56.020
Okay.

04:35:57.020 --> 04:35:58.020
So let's...

04:35:58.020 --> 04:36:00.020
Let's see what happens.

04:36:00.020 --> 04:36:04.020
Let's see, we're at 55% I believe.

04:36:04.020 --> 04:36:05.020
I've gone the wrong way.

04:36:05.020 --> 04:36:06.020
Oh, no, not.

04:36:09.020 --> 04:36:10.020
Oh, I remember this one.

04:36:10.020 --> 04:36:11.020
That's stupid.

04:36:13.020 --> 04:36:15.020
You go all the way around in order to...

04:36:15.020 --> 04:36:17.020
Oh, actually, I'm going to send off a sassan with roots.

04:36:17.020 --> 04:36:18.020
I need to level them up

04:36:18.020 --> 04:36:21.020
and we need money, money, money for tourist attractions.

04:36:21.020 --> 04:36:22.020
Wee!

04:36:24.020 --> 04:36:25.020
I know, I know.

04:36:26.020 --> 04:36:29.020
Knowing that a streamer you like is on most of the day

04:36:29.020 --> 04:36:31.020
is a god time for viewers.

04:36:31.020 --> 04:36:33.020
Yeah, I don't really get burned out.

04:36:33.020 --> 04:36:35.020
I'm happy to talk about it, but...

04:36:37.020 --> 04:36:39.020
I just don't seem to experience...

04:36:39.020 --> 04:36:41.020
So don't get me wrong.

04:36:41.020 --> 04:36:45.020
I absolutely can have days where I am

04:36:45.020 --> 04:36:48.020
ready to go to bed,

04:36:48.020 --> 04:36:50.020
but I wake up on the other side of bed

04:36:50.020 --> 04:36:52.020
and I'm like,

04:36:52.020 --> 04:36:53.020
yeah, let's do it.

04:36:53.020 --> 04:36:54.020
What are we doing?

04:36:54.020 --> 04:36:55.020
Let's go do this.

04:36:55.020 --> 04:36:56.020
Let's go do that.

04:36:58.020 --> 04:37:01.020
Send them off for 200 type thing.

04:37:01.020 --> 04:37:03.020
But actual burnout,

04:37:03.020 --> 04:37:04.020
I always wake up the next day

04:37:04.020 --> 04:37:06.020
wanting to do something more...

04:37:06.020 --> 04:37:07.020
Oh, there's actually a contract right here.

04:37:07.020 --> 04:37:08.020
Wee!

04:37:08.020 --> 04:37:09.020
Is that inside?

04:37:12.020 --> 04:37:14.020
There's a killing contract inside here.

04:37:14.020 --> 04:37:16.020
Oh, it's fantasy there!

04:37:17.020 --> 04:37:18.020
Hello, madam.

04:37:19.020 --> 04:37:20.020
Madam?

04:37:20.020 --> 04:37:21.020
Let's talk.

04:37:26.020 --> 04:37:28.020
Hard part will be the last 5%.

04:37:28.020 --> 04:37:29.020
Yeah, I agree.

04:37:43.020 --> 04:37:46.020
What's the hundred percent?

04:37:47.020 --> 04:37:50.020
New assassin contracts on lot?

04:37:50.020 --> 04:37:53.020
Say no more, my lady.

04:37:53.020 --> 04:37:55.020
Say no more.

04:37:57.020 --> 04:37:58.020
Okay.

04:37:58.020 --> 04:38:00.020
Let me get up.

04:38:00.020 --> 04:38:02.020
Okay, we've got more assassin contract,

04:38:02.020 --> 04:38:04.020
which means the percentage will get even higher

04:38:04.020 --> 04:38:06.020
very shortly once I do them.

04:38:08.020 --> 04:38:10.020
Send away my assassins to level up and...

04:38:12.020 --> 04:38:13.020
Oh, pardon me.

04:38:13.020 --> 04:38:14.020
Excuse me, come through.

04:38:14.020 --> 04:38:16.020
My ladies, would you like to distract those?

04:38:19.020 --> 04:38:21.020
More ladies!

04:38:21.020 --> 04:38:23.020
Would you like to come...

04:38:24.020 --> 04:38:27.020
and distract some guards?

04:38:28.020 --> 04:38:30.020
If there's any guards ahead.

04:38:30.020 --> 04:38:31.020
Unfortunately, I'm on a horse,

04:38:31.020 --> 04:38:33.020
so I'm much faster than them.

04:38:33.020 --> 04:38:35.020
And the horse is stuck on the hill.

04:38:35.020 --> 04:38:37.020
That's the only thing I don't like about this game.

04:38:38.020 --> 04:38:39.020
Right.

04:38:39.020 --> 04:38:40.020
There's no guards,

04:38:40.020 --> 04:38:41.020
so we're just gonna...

04:38:41.020 --> 04:38:43.020
We'll be fine, it's okay.

04:38:44.020 --> 04:38:45.020
Where's this guy?

04:38:45.020 --> 04:38:47.020
I'm on the wrong side.

04:38:47.020 --> 04:38:48.020
Hello?

04:38:48.020 --> 04:38:49.020
Oh, there you are.

04:39:00.020 --> 04:39:02.020
What are these contracts doing?

04:39:14.020 --> 04:39:15.020
Merda.

04:39:15.020 --> 04:39:17.020
He would kill us if we stayed here.

04:39:17.020 --> 04:39:20.020
Listen, I will run to the next pillar to draw his fire.

04:39:20.020 --> 04:39:23.020
He's swinging her huge percent in her face.

04:39:23.020 --> 04:39:27.020
Kill the target using the hidden bleed within 45 seconds.

04:39:28.020 --> 04:39:31.020
I don't like times, but let's try it.

04:39:33.020 --> 04:39:34.020
They're so bastard.

04:39:35.020 --> 04:39:37.020
45 seconds, run, run, run, run, run, run.

04:39:37.020 --> 04:39:38.020
He's gonna close that.

04:39:38.020 --> 04:39:40.020
Okay, I can tell.

04:39:42.020 --> 04:39:43.020
Okay.

04:39:44.020 --> 04:39:45.020
Okay.

04:39:46.020 --> 04:39:48.020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

04:39:48.020 --> 04:39:50.020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

04:39:53.020 --> 04:39:54.020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

04:39:54.020 --> 04:39:55.020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

04:39:56.020 --> 04:39:58.020
45 seconds, hidden bleed.

04:39:58.020 --> 04:40:01.020
45 seconds, hidden bleed, hidden bleed, hidden bleed.

04:40:02.020 --> 04:40:05.020
I love hurting people with a hidden bleed.

04:40:05.020 --> 04:40:07.020
Okay, we did it.

04:40:10.020 --> 04:40:13.020
His name is Laquac.

04:40:13.020 --> 04:40:18.500
What's your take on the best AC game regarding story-wise?

04:40:18.500 --> 04:40:21.180
Exio's story-wise?

04:40:21.180 --> 04:40:23.580
Like all of Exio?

04:40:23.580 --> 04:40:27.880
Uh, like especially Revelations when-

04:40:27.880 --> 04:40:29.580
Well, why am I under attack?

04:40:29.580 --> 04:40:30.580
What's going on?

04:40:30.580 --> 04:40:31.580
Come here, man.

04:40:31.580 --> 04:40:34.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, where did you even come from?

04:40:34.580 --> 04:40:40.580
I didn't want to hurt anyone, though, as you're doing.

04:40:40.580 --> 04:40:45.300
I saw that, so we'll grab it.

04:40:45.300 --> 04:40:47.420
I didn't even know where those guys came from.

04:40:47.420 --> 04:40:49.420
They're no station here, right?

04:40:49.420 --> 04:40:50.420
Uh...

04:40:50.420 --> 04:40:56.420
I don't know if I'm going to go longer on.

04:40:56.420 --> 04:40:57.420
Hmm.

04:40:57.420 --> 04:40:59.860
You know my favorite part of these?

04:40:59.860 --> 04:41:02.940
Exio's killing a lot of the multiplayer characters.

04:41:02.940 --> 04:41:03.940
Yes!

04:41:03.940 --> 04:41:04.940
Definitely.

04:41:04.940 --> 04:41:08.380
Okay, we'll go get this assassin contract.

04:41:08.380 --> 04:41:13.660
We'll kind of just spin around the map again, like how we did when we were renovating everything.

04:41:13.660 --> 04:41:15.780
Spin around the map.

04:41:15.780 --> 04:41:19.460
Why is he whispering in Italian to a French?

04:41:19.460 --> 04:41:24.620
I don't even know how you'd say rest in peace in French.

04:41:24.620 --> 04:41:25.620
Dormez-vous!

04:41:25.620 --> 04:41:27.620
Dormez-vous, mate!

04:41:27.620 --> 04:41:28.620
So la-vous!

04:41:28.620 --> 04:41:29.620
C'est n'est pas la vie?

04:41:29.620 --> 04:41:30.620
No, no, it's not the life anymore.

04:41:30.620 --> 04:41:41.340
My French is awful.

04:41:41.340 --> 04:41:45.380
I get very confused with how these structure, like, words in French.

04:41:45.380 --> 04:41:46.380
It's pretty...

04:41:46.380 --> 04:41:50.620
Do you ever think about if Exio was really here to be an insane serial killer and probably

04:41:50.620 --> 04:41:51.620
the highest killer?

04:41:51.620 --> 04:41:52.620
Oh, yeah.

04:41:52.620 --> 04:41:54.660
Actually, who does have the highest kill count?

04:41:54.660 --> 04:41:55.660
Oh!

04:41:55.660 --> 04:41:57.780
Don't answer that, actually.

04:41:57.780 --> 04:41:58.780
Yeah.

04:41:58.780 --> 04:41:59.780
Not necessary.

04:41:59.780 --> 04:42:00.780
Thank you.

04:42:00.780 --> 04:42:01.780
Okay.

04:42:01.780 --> 04:42:02.780
Hmm.

04:42:02.780 --> 04:42:09.780
Okay, I'm going to grab this flag right now.

04:42:09.780 --> 04:42:16.780
Yeah, no, I asked the question and my brain then flashed up the answer and I was like,

04:42:16.780 --> 04:42:17.780
ah, mm, mm.

04:42:17.780 --> 04:42:22.780
Okay, we're not doing this.

04:42:22.780 --> 04:42:25.260
Now we're just memeing along.

04:42:25.260 --> 04:42:27.660
We're not really talking about each other.

04:42:27.660 --> 04:42:33.620
I've discovered why my percentage was going up so slow, so we're currently in the question

04:42:33.620 --> 04:42:38.980
mark stage of, is this going to be a 12 hour marathon to 100% the game or not?

04:42:38.980 --> 04:42:43.660
Because I couldn't figure out why the frickin' game.

04:42:43.660 --> 04:42:45.660
Oh, we need...

04:42:45.660 --> 04:42:52.660
Okay, you guys are like so close to being maxed out, it's crazy.

04:42:52.660 --> 04:42:54.660
I'm not going to send you away for 20 minutes.

04:42:54.660 --> 04:42:58.660
So do you like that after doing that?

04:42:58.660 --> 04:43:00.660
Yes, we do.

04:43:00.660 --> 04:43:03.660
The other two, we don't even need to send away anymore.

04:43:03.660 --> 04:43:04.660
More.

04:43:04.660 --> 04:43:06.660
Do you need like 24?

04:43:06.660 --> 04:43:10.660
No, you need a bit more XP than that.

04:43:10.660 --> 04:43:14.660
Got a level 82 XP for you.

04:43:14.660 --> 04:43:16.660
Yeah, that looks like quick math.

04:43:16.660 --> 04:43:19.660
That looks good to me.

04:43:19.660 --> 04:43:22.660
My brain was still explicit in the context.

04:43:22.660 --> 04:43:24.660
No, no, I don't need me.

04:43:24.660 --> 04:43:26.660
Oh, I need to accept the contract.

04:43:26.660 --> 04:43:32.660
Actually, oh, I'm going to send the thieves on this person over here, actually.

04:43:32.660 --> 04:43:36.660
Actually, factually.

04:43:36.660 --> 04:43:40.660
As long as you set them on someone, you don't actually have to stick around or anything.

04:43:40.660 --> 04:43:44.660
I'm going to grab this feather while I'm at it as well, because I'm really close to it.

04:43:44.660 --> 04:43:50.660
Right, as well.

04:43:50.660 --> 04:43:53.660
It's also a feather on the Colosseum that you go back for.

04:43:53.660 --> 04:43:56.660
That's 6 out of 10.

04:43:56.660 --> 04:43:58.660
Wait, why are you guys still following me?

04:43:58.660 --> 04:44:02.660
Did you not lure their guards?

04:44:02.660 --> 04:44:10.660
I guess they didn't activate because they weren't close enough.

04:44:10.660 --> 04:44:13.660
Wait, do you only lure away stationary guards?

04:44:13.660 --> 04:44:15.660
Can't he be?

04:44:15.660 --> 04:44:17.660
Oh, wow.

04:44:17.660 --> 04:44:19.660
I did not know that.

04:44:19.660 --> 04:44:21.660
I thought you could lure anyone.

04:44:21.660 --> 04:44:25.660
So I have to pick stationary guards?

04:44:25.660 --> 04:44:28.660
I have not bought the Colosseum.

04:44:28.660 --> 04:44:30.660
I actually might have enough.

04:44:30.660 --> 04:44:34.660
Right, there.

04:44:34.660 --> 04:44:38.660
Right, they're luring him away.

04:44:38.660 --> 04:44:42.660
I'm going to go and get this nation.

04:44:42.660 --> 04:44:43.660
Oh, a maestro.

04:44:43.660 --> 04:44:46.660
I saw that, I saw that.

04:44:46.660 --> 04:44:53.660
I need five assassins to be maestro and then we'll do some more reblet.

04:44:53.660 --> 04:44:56.660
You just have to be good at the game.

04:44:56.660 --> 04:44:59.660
I say you're done.

04:44:59.660 --> 04:45:00.660
Wait, is this funny?

04:45:00.660 --> 04:45:03.660
I'm coming for you.

04:45:03.660 --> 04:45:09.660
Constantinople.

04:45:09.660 --> 04:45:11.660
Wow, you actually...

04:45:11.660 --> 04:45:15.660
Right, I'll send them two together because they're not ready yet.

04:45:15.660 --> 04:45:19.660
No, I keep forgetting to accept the fricking contract.

04:45:19.660 --> 04:45:22.660
Hi, hi, hi.

04:45:22.660 --> 04:45:24.660
Yes, yes, yes.

04:45:24.660 --> 04:45:26.660
Right, what's the mission assignment?

04:45:26.660 --> 04:45:28.660
Make a nice and easy peasy.

04:45:28.660 --> 04:45:31.660
Finish the memory within two minutes.

04:45:31.660 --> 04:45:33.660
Where am I supposed to go?

04:45:33.660 --> 04:45:34.660
Do I need to go by horse or not?

04:45:34.660 --> 04:45:43.660
Yes or no?

04:45:43.660 --> 04:45:45.660
The thing is, you take...

04:45:45.660 --> 04:45:51.660
If you just directly sprint...

04:45:51.660 --> 04:45:53.660
Yeah, see, this is the problem.

04:45:53.660 --> 04:45:58.660
All this stuff is in the way in order to get to them in under two minutes.

04:45:58.660 --> 04:46:02.660
Gallop, please.

04:46:02.660 --> 04:46:04.660
Yeah, okay.

04:46:04.660 --> 04:46:06.660
Faster, faster, faster.

04:46:06.660 --> 04:46:08.660
Yeah, okay, the horse was definitely the better bet.

04:46:08.660 --> 04:46:11.660
You could not run that.

04:46:11.660 --> 04:46:13.660
And just says do it in under two minutes.

04:46:13.660 --> 04:46:15.660
So...

04:46:15.660 --> 04:46:17.660
Yeah, what are you?

04:46:17.660 --> 04:46:19.660
They're on horseback.

04:46:19.660 --> 04:46:23.660
No, that makes fighting so annoying.

04:46:23.660 --> 04:46:25.660
Oh, sorry, I've got a nitri nose.

04:46:25.660 --> 04:46:27.660
So if my tracking goes away...

04:46:27.660 --> 04:46:29.660
It's a running face.

04:46:29.660 --> 04:46:31.660
Okay.

04:46:31.660 --> 04:46:33.660
Okay, so glad I took the fricking horse.

04:46:33.660 --> 04:46:37.660
Holy crap.

04:46:37.660 --> 04:46:40.660
Okay, that's...

04:46:40.660 --> 04:46:43.660
It's just so easy.

04:46:43.660 --> 04:46:45.660
It's just so easy.

04:46:45.660 --> 04:46:46.660
It's so good.

04:46:46.660 --> 04:46:47.660
Like, I love these missions.

04:46:47.660 --> 04:46:48.660
Holy crap.

04:46:48.660 --> 04:46:51.660
I had no idea how easy they were.

04:46:51.660 --> 04:46:52.660
Oh, excellent.

04:46:52.660 --> 04:46:54.660
It's like that.

04:46:54.660 --> 04:46:58.660
Literally a minute to spare.

04:46:58.660 --> 04:47:00.660
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

04:47:00.660 --> 04:47:02.660
Another one.

04:47:02.660 --> 04:47:03.660
Another one.

04:47:03.660 --> 04:47:07.660
Oh, do you want to come with me and we'll distract some guards?

04:47:07.660 --> 04:47:12.660
I should be so close to doing the distraction on...

04:47:12.660 --> 04:47:16.660
Okay.

04:47:16.660 --> 04:47:19.660
There's a guard over here.

04:47:19.660 --> 04:47:21.660
Actually, I need to walk around.

04:47:21.660 --> 04:47:24.660
I might distract.

04:47:24.660 --> 04:47:26.660
I didn't do anything.

04:47:26.660 --> 04:47:27.660
May I ask that?

04:47:27.660 --> 04:47:30.660
Time to perish.

04:47:30.660 --> 04:47:33.660
Are you ready?

04:47:33.660 --> 04:47:36.660
Oh, is it because I had the weapon out maybe?

04:47:36.660 --> 04:47:49.660
Yeah, I literally did not know.

04:47:49.660 --> 04:47:53.660
So the good thing with the mercenaries, if you walk around with them to the next location,

04:47:53.660 --> 04:48:00.660
you can keep setting them on new people to attack, so I'm just going to bring them with me.

04:48:00.660 --> 04:48:10.660
And once they've attacked 10 people, then we have done that section of the mercenaries challenge.

04:48:10.660 --> 04:48:17.660
Do you think Margaret Thatcher effectively utilised girl power by funneling money into the gold?

04:48:17.660 --> 04:48:19.660
Parliamentary death squad?

04:48:19.660 --> 04:48:22.660
Oh, jeez.

04:48:22.660 --> 04:48:27.660
I'm just here to play video games.

04:48:27.660 --> 04:48:36.660
I'm quite happy to admit that this topic of conversation is completely out of my knowledge realm.

04:48:36.660 --> 04:48:38.660
No, I've never played it with monsters.

04:48:38.660 --> 04:48:43.660
I prefer to play games vanilla to appreciate the way that the development team made it.

04:48:43.660 --> 04:48:48.660
A lot of people don't like vanilla Skyrim, and I'm so sorry, but I just enjoy it.

04:48:48.660 --> 04:49:00.660
I didn't know, because I played on Xbox, that on vanilla Skyrim, because I was on Xbox,

04:49:00.660 --> 04:49:06.660
that the little dots on the floor were daisies and grass until I played on PC for the first time.

04:49:06.660 --> 04:49:14.660
Oh, is it? Am I pooping or is that mud?

04:49:15.660 --> 04:49:25.660
Why are they insisting on walking into me, honestly?

04:49:25.660 --> 04:49:31.660
I just tried to watch A.G's stream, E.B's stream, but I'm deaf on my left ear,

04:49:31.660 --> 04:49:33.660
so it went silent for 10 seconds on my right ear.

04:49:33.660 --> 04:49:35.660
But you heard that? I'm like, I don't know.

04:49:35.660 --> 04:49:37.660
Oh, bless you.

04:49:37.660 --> 04:49:41.660
What happened?

04:49:42.660 --> 04:49:47.660
Were you born like that, or did you get tinnitus?

04:49:47.660 --> 04:49:49.660
Are they still not done with that fight?

04:49:49.660 --> 04:49:54.660
Oh, the guy went back on his horse. I was actually going to send him on him.

04:49:54.660 --> 04:49:56.660
Oh, they're still fighting? Come on.

04:49:56.660 --> 04:50:03.660
It's just one guy in armor.

04:50:03.660 --> 04:50:06.660
Come on, you can do that. I believe in this.

04:50:06.660 --> 04:50:12.660
Horses kicking, literally. I've never had the horse being pushed into the floor.

04:50:12.660 --> 04:50:17.660
Come on, mercenaries.

04:50:17.660 --> 04:50:20.660
Come on. Yeah, there you go.

04:50:20.660 --> 04:50:23.660
Right, we're going to send him on this guy now.

04:50:23.660 --> 04:50:25.660
Thank you, sir.

04:50:32.660 --> 04:50:34.660
The Guardia?

04:50:34.660 --> 04:50:40.660
Oh, they're beating that horse up.

04:50:40.660 --> 04:50:43.660
I don't know how many mercenary challenges are completed.

04:50:43.660 --> 04:50:48.660
All their stuff is weapon-based. They're doing something impressive, a weapon.

04:50:48.660 --> 04:50:52.660
We're going to say, do you guys need help?

04:50:52.660 --> 04:50:55.660
Do you guys need help with him?

04:50:55.660 --> 04:50:57.660
Okay, definitely. Do you need help with him?

04:50:57.660 --> 04:50:58.660
Yeah, I'm done.

04:50:58.660 --> 04:51:03.660
Thanks, guys. Glad I hired you.

04:51:10.660 --> 04:51:12.660
Bought stone, bought things, taken so long.

04:51:12.660 --> 04:51:16.660
I know.

04:51:16.660 --> 04:51:21.660
I've almost done sending the mercenaries on people, at least.

04:51:21.660 --> 04:51:23.660
Is this, like, five, maybe?

04:51:23.660 --> 04:51:31.660
If they could just perish some a bit faster, you know, we can be there.

04:51:31.660 --> 04:51:38.660
And they tell him, like, just hooded man on horse since four men to fight.

04:51:38.660 --> 04:51:40.660
Ten years working around engine rooms.

04:51:40.660 --> 04:51:44.660
Oh, no, that's, like, the quickest way to lose hearing.

04:51:44.660 --> 04:51:46.660
It's, like, works like that.

04:51:46.660 --> 04:51:48.660
Okay, moving up.

04:51:48.660 --> 04:51:50.660
Fire messages disappeared.

04:51:50.660 --> 04:51:52.660
Mozi, y'all feeling okay?

04:51:52.660 --> 04:51:54.660
Am I going crazy?

04:51:54.660 --> 04:51:55.660
Rubber room.

04:51:55.660 --> 04:51:57.660
I'm rubber roomed for the rest.

04:52:02.660 --> 04:52:03.660
Stop.

04:52:03.660 --> 04:52:05.660
Right, we're almost there.

04:52:05.660 --> 04:52:07.660
We're almost there.

04:52:11.660 --> 04:52:13.660
Right, fight him.

04:52:14.660 --> 04:52:19.660
Fill him off the horse or something.

04:52:27.660 --> 04:52:33.660
This is going to take forever.

04:52:33.660 --> 04:52:36.660
Is there, like, another mercenary group right here?

04:52:36.660 --> 04:52:37.660
Yeah.

04:52:37.660 --> 04:52:39.660
Okay, can I have you?

04:52:39.660 --> 04:52:43.660
And then can I send you to fight this group that's already fighting?

04:52:43.660 --> 04:52:44.660
Oh, it works!

04:52:44.660 --> 04:52:47.660
Okay, there, they're completely outnumbered.

04:52:49.660 --> 04:52:51.660
That must be, what, six now?

04:52:51.660 --> 04:52:53.660
Only four more to go.

04:52:53.660 --> 04:52:55.660
I'm born deaf in my left ear.

04:52:55.660 --> 04:52:58.660
Perfect for sleeping because I sleep on my right side.

04:53:00.660 --> 04:53:03.660
Okay, now, follow me.

04:53:05.660 --> 04:53:07.660
So this will be seven?

04:53:08.660 --> 04:53:11.660
Oh, for goodness sake, that's taking forever.

04:53:14.660 --> 04:53:16.660
I'll do that, though.

04:53:16.660 --> 04:53:20.660
Because when you send them, they don't have to win the fight.

04:53:20.660 --> 04:53:22.660
It's just when you send them on people.

04:53:22.660 --> 04:53:24.660
Actually, you know what?

04:53:24.660 --> 04:53:25.660
I'm just checking.

04:53:25.660 --> 04:53:26.660
I'm just checking.

04:53:26.660 --> 04:53:28.660
I can't take this anymore.

04:53:28.660 --> 04:53:30.660
Gale challenges.

04:53:30.660 --> 04:53:32.660
Mercenary?

04:53:32.660 --> 04:53:33.660
Nine?

04:53:33.660 --> 04:53:34.660
Okay.

04:53:35.660 --> 04:53:36.660
Ugh.

04:53:47.660 --> 04:53:49.660
That must be done from a certain location.

04:53:49.660 --> 04:53:50.660
Yeah, double assassination.

04:53:50.660 --> 04:53:53.660
Three out of ten, I can hardly get it done.

04:53:53.660 --> 04:53:55.660
Court is on, nine.

04:53:55.660 --> 04:53:56.660
Oh, guard's poisoned.

04:53:56.660 --> 04:53:58.660
It's fifteen, so I do need to go poison.

04:53:58.660 --> 04:54:00.660
There's kind of more guards.

04:54:00.660 --> 04:54:02.660
I assume if they hate each other down, it doesn't count.

04:54:02.660 --> 04:54:03.660
Okay.

04:54:03.660 --> 04:54:05.660
These, honor, honor, and spread.

04:54:05.660 --> 04:54:07.660
Leaves of faith, I need twenty.

04:54:09.660 --> 04:54:11.660
Guards are assassinating from me.

04:54:12.660 --> 04:54:13.660
Okay.

04:54:13.660 --> 04:54:14.660
Oh, there she is.

04:54:17.660 --> 04:54:20.660
I just need to find one enemy.

04:54:20.660 --> 04:54:21.660
Hello.

04:54:21.660 --> 04:54:23.660
You are enemy.

04:54:23.660 --> 04:54:25.660
And fight.

04:54:25.660 --> 04:54:26.660
Okay.

04:54:26.660 --> 04:54:27.660
Finally.

04:54:27.660 --> 04:54:29.660
That took so long.

04:54:29.660 --> 04:54:31.660
Hiring discount earned a little bit.

04:54:34.660 --> 04:54:35.660
Hello.

04:54:48.660 --> 04:54:51.660
Man, look at his fresh cut on that beard.

04:54:51.660 --> 04:54:52.660
Look at that angle.

04:54:52.660 --> 04:54:54.660
Is that even possible by then?

04:54:54.660 --> 04:55:05.660
I was really dumb, but, like, before razors were invented, did guys just, like, shape their beard on rocks and stuff?

04:55:05.660 --> 04:55:09.660
Like, I know that sounds really silly, but did they, like, fashion a rock to be sharp?

04:55:09.660 --> 04:55:11.660
And then that's how you got rid of your beard?

04:55:11.660 --> 04:55:15.660
Or did, like, everyone just have beards back in the old days?

04:55:15.660 --> 04:55:18.660
The razors weren't a thing.

04:55:18.660 --> 04:55:20.660
Maybe glass?

04:55:20.660 --> 04:55:23.660
It was a hundred percent.

04:55:23.660 --> 04:55:26.660
Kill by air assassination.

04:55:26.660 --> 04:55:28.660
I can absolutely do that.

04:55:29.660 --> 04:55:31.660
Shave with swords.

04:55:31.660 --> 04:55:33.660
Not, like, before that kind of effect.

04:55:33.660 --> 04:55:36.660
What the heck must we do on this stuff?

04:55:38.660 --> 04:55:40.660
Oh, wow, that's such a good faraway.

04:55:40.660 --> 04:55:42.660
Um, maybe or something?

04:55:48.660 --> 04:55:49.660
I'm tired of thieves.

04:55:49.660 --> 04:55:54.660
They may be able to keep up, if I can do a little way to guard things.

04:55:54.660 --> 04:55:55.660
Yeah, yeah.

04:55:55.660 --> 04:55:57.660
We're getting there, we're getting there, we're getting there.

04:56:03.660 --> 04:56:05.660
Here is, oh, I'm getting stuck on a rope.

04:56:05.660 --> 04:56:07.660
They shaved with knives.

04:56:08.660 --> 04:56:12.660
They just got the homies to scratch their beards off by hand.

04:56:12.660 --> 04:56:15.660
That sounds painful as anything.

04:56:16.660 --> 04:56:18.660
Shave with obsidian.

04:56:19.660 --> 04:56:21.660
The guy's still dead.

04:56:22.660 --> 04:56:24.660
Okay, what am I supposed to do?

04:56:24.660 --> 04:56:26.660
Oh, air assassination.

04:56:26.660 --> 04:56:31.660
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the guy's probably up in this building then, since it's all red.

04:56:35.660 --> 04:56:37.660
Not gonna be discovered, am I?

04:56:37.660 --> 04:56:39.660
Hello, goodbye.

04:56:39.660 --> 04:56:46.660
Actually, I need to start looting bodies, cause I'm getting low on supplies, cause I'm wasting them all.

04:56:47.660 --> 04:56:49.660
Mid.

04:56:55.660 --> 04:56:57.660
Okay, air assassination.

04:56:59.660 --> 04:57:01.660
Let's give that a shot, where is he?

04:57:02.660 --> 04:57:04.660
Gee, I wonder where it's air assassination.

04:57:04.660 --> 04:57:06.660
Oh, I just called him a horse doing that.

04:57:10.660 --> 04:57:13.660
I need to get away, that's why I called him a horse.

04:57:16.660 --> 04:57:20.660
Having strongies mug on two monitors is overwhelming.

04:57:20.660 --> 04:57:22.660
Wait until I make hypnosis.

04:57:22.660 --> 04:57:24.660
I'm so excited to make my first one.

04:57:24.660 --> 04:57:26.660
I don't know what to do.

04:57:27.660 --> 04:57:32.660
I was gonna do a, like, free thing.

04:57:33.660 --> 04:57:36.660
God, these missions are so good and easy.

04:57:36.660 --> 04:57:38.660
I can't go over it.

04:57:38.660 --> 04:57:40.660
I'm not doing the Naruto.

04:57:40.660 --> 04:57:45.660
I'll keep doing the Templar Agents, cause it's starting to get less and less.

04:57:45.660 --> 04:57:49.660
Copernico is a nightmare, if I remember correctly.

04:57:49.660 --> 04:57:56.660
Copernico is, like, throw yourself across the city as fast as you can type missions, which I despise.

04:57:56.660 --> 04:58:02.660
And, like, it really does not give you, like, much time at all, so I'm not looking forward to doing Copernico.

04:58:03.660 --> 04:58:06.660
No, I don't need the body, but thank you.

04:58:06.660 --> 04:58:08.660
Hello, horsey.

04:58:08.660 --> 04:58:10.660
Are you ready?

04:58:10.660 --> 04:58:12.660
Mount.

04:58:12.660 --> 04:58:14.660
Mabos.

04:58:14.660 --> 04:58:16.660
Mabos.

04:58:16.660 --> 04:58:18.660
Well, the horse, please think of Mabos.

04:58:20.660 --> 04:58:22.660
Okay, I think we're gonna pull one way around.

04:58:24.660 --> 04:58:27.660
Speaking of, are you gonna collab with Secret Subject?

04:58:27.660 --> 04:58:29.660
I haven't reached out yet.

04:58:29.660 --> 04:58:31.660
I know Secret is, like, super busy.

04:58:31.660 --> 04:58:37.660
Like, she's got, like, the new VTuber model and everything going on.

04:58:37.660 --> 04:58:43.660
And, uh, I don't want to be, like, a bother, like, harassing anyone.

04:58:45.660 --> 04:58:48.660
I might get the boss to reach out.

04:58:48.660 --> 04:58:55.660
But at the moment, like, I've actually got quite a lot of people that are interested in collabs with me,

04:58:55.660 --> 04:58:58.660
and I'm gonna try and, like, not take too much time.

04:58:58.660 --> 04:59:02.660
Like, as she says, as she plays on stream for 12 hours,

04:59:02.660 --> 04:59:07.660
and literally has, like, folk waiting on her right in the script, so it can be sent off.

04:59:07.660 --> 04:59:09.660
Well, that was fun.

04:59:10.660 --> 04:59:15.660
Um, but yeah, I don't want to leave too much of the pee.

04:59:15.660 --> 04:59:17.660
Send you away.

04:59:17.660 --> 04:59:19.660
Can I send?

04:59:20.660 --> 04:59:23.660
I'm so sorry. I think I need a drawing.

04:59:25.660 --> 04:59:27.660
I think it's time.

04:59:27.660 --> 04:59:35.660
The problem is that I take, like, five minutes to generate one.

04:59:35.660 --> 04:59:37.660
I really don't want to go.

04:59:40.660 --> 04:59:44.660
I know it didn't happen yesterday, which I'm really happy about,

04:59:44.660 --> 04:59:47.660
but I think it's happening.

04:59:47.660 --> 04:59:49.660
Oh, wait, sorry. Oh, sorry.

04:59:49.660 --> 04:59:55.660
I need to go into an emergency meeting with one of the girls over something.

04:59:55.660 --> 05:00:03.660
But I'm, like, 90% sure I can feel my organs shifting around.

05:00:03.660 --> 05:00:06.660
I have no coin on my corpse.

05:00:07.660 --> 05:00:10.660
Ah, I can hear them behind me. That's actually pretty scary.

05:00:10.660 --> 05:00:12.660
Nah.

05:00:14.660 --> 05:00:16.660
Oh, no, no, no.

05:00:16.660 --> 05:00:20.660
I will take advantage of the smoke, because we need to kill enemies in smoke.

05:00:31.660 --> 05:00:34.660
Right, they can all just fight each other.

05:00:35.660 --> 05:00:37.660
Oh, I need to go into the smoke.

05:00:39.660 --> 05:00:42.660
Any idea when the first hit in the stream I'll do my job?

05:00:44.660 --> 05:00:46.660
It's time is my biggest problem.

05:00:46.660 --> 05:00:51.660
Like, if we end up doing this 100%, I don't know if it's possible.

05:00:51.660 --> 05:00:55.660
Then I probably won't do it tonight.

05:00:55.660 --> 05:01:00.660
Needy streamer, I need to go out and buy American sweets for this hand cam stream

05:01:00.660 --> 05:01:03.660
and clean up my desk, because it's an absolute mess.

05:01:04.660 --> 05:01:06.660
And get a nice cute outfit and all that.

05:01:09.660 --> 05:01:11.660
It's just time, honestly.

05:01:11.660 --> 05:01:15.660
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm not interested in making it.

05:01:15.660 --> 05:01:18.660
It's just time I've got these Ace Mark gloves and girls are waiting on me.

05:01:18.660 --> 05:01:22.660
And then I'm sending away shorts of the girls to be made to Clippers,

05:01:22.660 --> 05:01:26.660
because I didn't want them being stressed out having to organize this stuff.

05:01:27.660 --> 05:01:34.660
And, like, I guess it's just trying to settle in right now,

05:01:34.660 --> 05:01:39.660
but I hope to have some consistent stuff that's free to access.

05:01:39.660 --> 05:01:45.660
Like, I do want at least something decent free to access on the alt,

05:01:45.660 --> 05:01:50.660
because I don't think it's fair, like, especially for, like, people just,

05:01:50.660 --> 05:01:53.660
they just simply don't have the money, like, I completely understand,

05:01:53.660 --> 05:01:57.660
like, don't ever feel bad if you're unable to, like, just straight up give money

05:01:57.660 --> 05:02:00.660
to, like, streamers or anything like that, like, any of the viewers.

05:02:00.660 --> 05:02:06.660
Like, I am 100% can say right now that, like, all the girls feel the exact same way as me.

05:02:06.660 --> 05:02:08.660
If you can't afford it, please don't feel bad.

05:02:08.660 --> 05:02:13.660
Like, literally watching, liking, commenting, flipping if you want,

05:02:13.660 --> 05:02:16.660
liking a tweet, like, all of this stuff is free to do.

05:02:16.660 --> 05:02:19.660
Like, that helps us beyond words.

05:02:19.660 --> 05:02:26.660
So don't ever feel inclined and, like, thank you for respect

05:02:26.660 --> 05:02:29.660
and that there, like, is a paywall on some of the content,

05:02:29.660 --> 05:02:32.660
because, obviously, the girls need to eat and they need to thrive,

05:02:32.660 --> 05:02:36.660
because if they don't, like, thrive monetary-wise,

05:02:36.660 --> 05:02:39.660
then, obviously, they're not going to stick around at VLR, why would you?

05:02:39.660 --> 05:02:45.660
So, like, I do appreciate everyone's, like, complete understanding around it.

05:02:45.660 --> 05:02:47.660
Um...

05:02:47.660 --> 05:02:48.660
Nope.

05:02:48.660 --> 05:02:49.660
Right.

05:02:49.660 --> 05:02:50.660
Okay, where's the source?

05:02:50.660 --> 05:02:51.660
I am actually, unironically stuck.

05:02:51.660 --> 05:02:53.660
Where the heck am I going?

05:02:57.660 --> 05:02:58.660
Over the bridge?

05:03:00.660 --> 05:03:01.660
Over the bridge?

05:03:01.660 --> 05:03:03.660
Over the broken bridge?

05:03:03.660 --> 05:03:05.660
The girls are doing great, don't worry.

05:03:07.660 --> 05:03:09.660
No, not over the broken bridge.

05:03:09.660 --> 05:03:11.660
Do not be fooled by the map.

05:03:11.660 --> 05:03:12.660
It's not that old.

05:03:12.660 --> 05:03:14.660
How do I get down though?

05:03:16.660 --> 05:03:19.660
I always have that problem whenever I come up to this section.

05:03:20.660 --> 05:03:23.660
You have to, like, all of your breath around me.

05:03:24.660 --> 05:03:27.660
We're already lucky and spoiled with what you've done for us already.

05:03:27.660 --> 05:03:29.660
No need to rush yet.

05:03:29.660 --> 05:03:31.660
Like, I know some folk are noticing, like,

05:03:31.660 --> 05:03:34.660
oh, all the girls aren't posting anymore.

05:03:34.660 --> 05:03:36.660
And it was, like...

05:03:36.660 --> 05:03:39.660
Yeah, the girls are live streaming now.

05:03:39.660 --> 05:03:41.660
They're preparing for streams.

05:03:41.660 --> 05:03:44.660
They're thinking our heads, like, like, that's stuff to do now.

05:03:44.660 --> 05:03:47.660
Before, the only stuff the girls could do

05:03:47.660 --> 05:03:50.660
was meme in the Discord with each other

05:03:50.660 --> 05:03:55.660
and muck about on Twitter and pre-record audios, you know?

05:03:55.660 --> 05:03:59.660
And now they've got so much to deal with and contend with, so...

05:04:01.660 --> 05:04:02.660
What am I doing?

05:04:03.660 --> 05:04:04.660
What am I doing before I mess up?

05:04:04.660 --> 05:04:05.660
Kill your target?

05:04:05.660 --> 05:04:07.660
Why is this game so good?

05:04:07.660 --> 05:04:10.660
These game missions are so good!

05:04:11.660 --> 05:04:13.660
It's actually making me angry.

05:04:13.660 --> 05:04:15.660
Have nice interfaces.

05:04:16.660 --> 05:04:20.660
Some... No, I do understand that some people, like, complain to complain.

05:04:20.660 --> 05:04:22.660
That's okay. That's just how some people are.

05:04:22.660 --> 05:04:25.660
Like, it's how they, like, get, you know, like, stressed out.

05:04:25.660 --> 05:04:28.660
It's therapeutic to kind of have a mop or whatever.

05:04:30.660 --> 05:04:33.660
It's a lady killer!

05:04:35.660 --> 05:04:37.660
Okay, I need to chase...

05:04:37.660 --> 05:04:39.660
Stop chasing me!

05:04:39.660 --> 05:04:42.660
No, you like it, you little rascal.

05:04:42.660 --> 05:04:44.660
You're teasing me.

05:04:45.660 --> 05:04:46.660
You're a leaky.

05:04:47.660 --> 05:04:49.660
I don't know what that means. They didn't put the subtitles in.

05:04:52.660 --> 05:04:53.660
Stop it!

05:04:54.660 --> 05:04:56.660
Oh, oh, oh! I love a good glitch.

05:04:56.660 --> 05:04:57.660
I love a good glitch.

05:04:57.660 --> 05:04:59.660
I love a good glitch.

05:04:59.660 --> 05:05:01.660
And that helps me get the objective.

05:05:01.660 --> 05:05:02.660
I love that.

05:05:05.660 --> 05:05:07.660
That was gorgeous. Do that again.

05:05:09.660 --> 05:05:13.660
Honestly, Renaissance outfit starting to grow in me.

05:05:14.660 --> 05:05:18.660
Kind of Renaissance influence outfit, maybe.

05:05:19.660 --> 05:05:22.660
Someone suggested a design...

05:05:23.660 --> 05:05:25.660
Which was...

05:05:25.660 --> 05:05:26.660
Ah...

05:05:27.660 --> 05:05:29.660
Was it an aristocrat?

05:05:30.660 --> 05:05:31.660
Vampire?

05:05:32.660 --> 05:05:35.660
No, it was a smug aristocrat.

05:05:35.660 --> 05:05:36.660
Mmm.

05:05:37.660 --> 05:05:40.660
I'm very, like, posh, hoity-toity looking.

05:05:40.660 --> 05:05:43.660
The only problem is they would have to be British,

05:05:43.660 --> 05:05:45.660
because if there were any other...

05:05:45.660 --> 05:05:48.660
I was about to say if there were any other gender,

05:05:48.660 --> 05:05:49.660
it doesn't work.

05:05:49.660 --> 05:05:50.660
If they're not British, I'm going to...

05:05:50.660 --> 05:05:52.660
Oh, Christina available!

05:05:52.660 --> 05:05:55.660
Wait, what's her DNA if Christina is available?

05:05:55.660 --> 05:05:57.660
I'm not questioning it.

05:05:57.660 --> 05:05:58.660
To Christina we go...

05:05:58.660 --> 05:06:00.660
Mom-

05:06:05.660 --> 05:06:07.660
Any other gender than British?

05:06:07.660 --> 05:06:09.660
Let's- I was like, okay, thanks, friend.

05:06:11.660 --> 05:06:12.660
Stroney?

05:06:12.660 --> 05:06:14.660
Yesterday, don't follow Lady Hoon, also me.

05:06:14.660 --> 05:06:16.660
No, no, no, no, I like that.

05:06:16.660 --> 05:06:18.660
It's a lady assassin, though.

05:06:19.660 --> 05:06:22.660
Only I am allowed to raise lady assassins.

05:06:24.660 --> 05:06:25.660
Okay.

05:06:25.660 --> 05:06:27.660
Something, Christina, because I have no idea

05:06:27.660 --> 05:06:30.660
what the heck that your fricking story line is.

05:06:31.660 --> 05:06:32.660
Alright, I need you guys,

05:06:32.660 --> 05:06:33.660
because you guys...

05:06:33.660 --> 05:06:35.660
I need to lure away guards with...

05:06:38.660 --> 05:06:40.660
Can I technically get you guys to...

05:06:40.660 --> 05:06:41.660
Well, why are you...

05:06:41.660 --> 05:06:42.660
Right, I guess not.

05:06:43.660 --> 05:06:45.660
There should be some guards coming up.

05:06:46.660 --> 05:06:47.660
God, they can run fast.

05:06:47.660 --> 05:06:49.660
They're keeping up with a horse practical.

05:06:52.660 --> 05:06:54.660
Lure them away.

05:06:54.660 --> 05:06:55.660
There we go.

05:06:57.660 --> 05:06:59.660
Aristocrat with a Jordi axe.

05:07:03.660 --> 05:07:05.660
Wait, I always get so...

05:07:06.660 --> 05:07:08.660
spun about when it comes to this section of the map.

05:07:08.660 --> 05:07:10.660
It's terrible.

05:07:12.660 --> 05:07:14.660
I think it's on this stage.

05:07:16.660 --> 05:07:18.660
Stuck their anger.

05:07:19.660 --> 05:07:21.660
Watch out, watch out.

05:07:22.660 --> 05:07:24.660
No, no, no.

05:07:26.660 --> 05:07:28.660
No, no, I missed something there.

05:07:30.660 --> 05:07:32.660
Goodness me.

05:07:32.660 --> 05:07:34.660
I just can't even get this right.

05:07:34.660 --> 05:07:36.660
Can't I just go on the wrong way?

05:07:36.660 --> 05:07:37.660
On the wrong way?

05:07:38.660 --> 05:07:39.660
You're the one that's right.

05:07:39.660 --> 05:07:40.660
Oh, excuse me.

05:07:40.660 --> 05:07:41.660
You're on my way.

05:07:42.660 --> 05:07:43.660
I could have sworn there's a cape

05:07:43.660 --> 05:07:45.660
that makes guards ignore you

05:07:45.660 --> 05:07:47.660
unless you, like, straight up attack them.

05:07:48.660 --> 05:07:49.660
I need to get into that.

05:07:49.660 --> 05:07:51.660
I don't know what cape that is.

05:07:55.660 --> 05:07:56.660
Oh, wow.

05:07:56.660 --> 05:07:58.660
I think that's 5-1-2.

05:08:06.660 --> 05:08:08.660
I'm just going to send them away for money

05:08:08.660 --> 05:08:11.660
because I think we actually might have enough now.

05:08:12.660 --> 05:08:13.660
No.

05:08:13.660 --> 05:08:14.660
For...

05:08:16.660 --> 05:08:17.660
For what?

05:08:17.660 --> 05:08:19.660
For buying everything yet.

05:08:21.660 --> 05:08:23.660
Right, Christina, my love.

05:08:24.660 --> 05:08:26.660
Thank you for unlocking

05:08:26.660 --> 05:08:28.660
because we were genuinely also confused

05:08:28.660 --> 05:08:31.660
on what a bizarre ending your storyline had

05:08:31.660 --> 05:08:33.660
because that didn't make any sense.

05:08:34.660 --> 05:08:36.660
And you know it didn't.

05:08:36.660 --> 05:08:38.660
So what on earth are we doing?

05:08:41.660 --> 05:08:42.660
Oh, no.

05:08:42.660 --> 05:08:43.660
Oh, no.

05:08:46.660 --> 05:08:47.660
Oh, no.

05:08:47.660 --> 05:08:49.660
I think we're going to the fair.

05:08:52.660 --> 05:08:54.660
Do you get an AC monster?

05:08:55.660 --> 05:08:57.660
Maybe put, like, an assassin's screen.

05:08:57.660 --> 05:08:58.660
Hold on me.

05:09:02.660 --> 05:09:03.660
So there'll be an assassin's screen.

05:09:03.660 --> 05:09:05.660
Oh, I've never thought about that.

05:09:05.660 --> 05:09:07.660
Maybe I should get AC's outfit

05:09:07.660 --> 05:09:09.660
and, like, but, like, you know,

05:09:09.660 --> 05:09:12.660
get the, like, red, lazy underwear and stuff.

05:09:17.660 --> 05:09:18.660
Leonardo!

05:09:39.660 --> 05:09:40.660
Aww.

05:09:47.660 --> 05:09:48.660
Aww.

05:09:48.660 --> 05:09:50.660
He's not over her.

05:09:50.660 --> 05:09:51.660
He's heartbroken.

05:09:54.660 --> 05:09:55.660
That's so sad.

05:09:58.660 --> 05:10:00.660
I can't remember what we have to do here, though.

05:10:02.660 --> 05:10:03.660
Oh, there she is!

05:10:04.660 --> 05:10:05.660
I'm to tail her.

05:10:10.660 --> 05:10:12.660
There she is.

05:10:12.660 --> 05:10:14.660
With her other hussies.

05:10:15.660 --> 05:10:17.660
Oh, Christina.

05:10:23.660 --> 05:10:25.660
I'm just so interested in these masks.

05:10:27.660 --> 05:10:29.660
She just got a circle.

05:10:29.660 --> 05:10:30.660
Wait, what was it?

05:10:30.660 --> 05:10:32.660
Am I supposed to do something?

05:10:33.660 --> 05:10:35.660
Oh, plan a letter on her.

05:10:35.660 --> 05:10:37.660
I beg your pardon.

05:10:37.660 --> 05:10:39.660
I was like, why did she just go in a circle?

05:10:45.660 --> 05:10:46.660
Okay.

05:10:46.660 --> 05:10:48.660
That makes much more sense.

05:10:48.660 --> 05:10:50.660
Way more sense.

05:10:53.660 --> 05:10:55.660
Okay, the rendezvous?

05:10:56.660 --> 05:10:58.660
Don't mind me.

05:11:02.660 --> 05:11:04.660
Wait, she reciprocates.

05:11:08.660 --> 05:11:09.660
Um...

05:11:16.660 --> 05:11:17.660
Um...

05:11:18.660 --> 05:11:20.660
It's you, that's wrong.

05:11:20.660 --> 05:11:21.660
This is...

05:11:21.660 --> 05:11:22.660
It's you.

05:11:38.660 --> 05:11:40.660
I haven't seen you in eight years.

05:11:40.660 --> 05:11:42.660
It's been eight years?

05:11:42.660 --> 05:11:44.660
You're right.

05:11:44.660 --> 05:11:46.660
I wouldn't have.

05:11:46.660 --> 05:11:47.660
It's you.

05:11:47.660 --> 05:11:48.660
The last time I saw you,

05:11:48.660 --> 05:11:50.660
you kissed me in an alley

05:11:50.660 --> 05:11:52.660
and then left me behind to be married.

05:11:52.660 --> 05:11:54.660
It was the right thing to do.

05:11:54.660 --> 05:11:55.660
We loved you.

05:11:55.660 --> 05:11:57.660
Who cares what he wanted?

05:11:57.660 --> 05:11:58.660
I love you!

05:12:01.660 --> 05:12:03.660
You have your second child.

05:12:04.660 --> 05:12:05.660
Please, Edson.

05:12:06.660 --> 05:12:07.660
It got worse!

05:12:07.660 --> 05:12:09.660
Why did we do this?

05:12:09.660 --> 05:12:11.660
Why did we play that memory?

05:12:11.660 --> 05:12:12.660
It got worse!

05:12:12.660 --> 05:12:14.660
Is that where it ends?

05:12:14.660 --> 05:12:16.660
That was even worse.

05:12:16.660 --> 05:12:18.660
Why did we go away?

05:12:18.660 --> 05:12:20.660
Why did we go further?

05:12:20.660 --> 05:12:22.660
There has to be another one.

05:12:22.660 --> 05:12:23.660
There's no way.

05:12:24.660 --> 05:12:26.660
It got so much worse.

05:12:29.660 --> 05:12:32.660
That was terrible.

05:12:36.660 --> 05:12:37.660
Aw.

05:12:42.660 --> 05:12:44.660
Shot through the heart, true.

05:12:45.660 --> 05:12:46.660
That got even.

05:12:46.660 --> 05:12:47.660
I don't know why...

05:12:47.660 --> 05:12:50.660
I don't know why I thought that memory would...

05:12:50.660 --> 05:12:53.660
Oh, that's going to be so much better than the last one.

05:12:53.660 --> 05:12:54.660
No.

05:12:56.660 --> 05:12:58.660
No, no, no, no, no.

05:12:58.660 --> 05:13:00.660
That's terrible.

05:13:02.660 --> 05:13:05.660
Well, she said don't find her again.

05:13:05.660 --> 05:13:07.660
But I'm left unsatisfied.

05:13:07.660 --> 05:13:09.660
I feel like that's such a short memory

05:13:09.660 --> 05:13:11.660
that's not like the true ending.

05:13:13.660 --> 05:13:15.660
Right, we're going to upgrade our assassins

05:13:15.660 --> 05:13:17.660
just because...

05:13:19.660 --> 05:13:22.660
we have the thing.

05:13:23.660 --> 05:13:26.660
I'm a ballard about the seas, honestly.

05:13:27.660 --> 05:13:29.660
I have quite a lot of money, though.

05:13:33.660 --> 05:13:35.660
Good on Christina for not being a cheater.

05:13:35.660 --> 05:13:37.660
Literally, like, when...

05:13:37.660 --> 05:13:40.660
Oh, when she was like, oh, husband's name.

05:13:40.660 --> 05:13:43.660
I was like, wait, Ezio planted the lair and...

05:13:46.660 --> 05:13:48.660
What a mess, Ezio.

05:13:48.660 --> 05:13:51.660
What a mess you've got yourself into in a pickle.

05:13:52.660 --> 05:13:55.660
Yeah, he sucks when it comes to romance.

05:13:55.660 --> 05:13:57.660
Everything is permitted.

05:14:01.660 --> 05:14:03.660
Goodness, gravy.

05:14:08.660 --> 05:14:10.660
Mm-hmm.

05:14:12.660 --> 05:14:13.660
Whoa.

05:14:16.660 --> 05:14:18.660
Welcome to the Brotherhood.

05:14:20.660 --> 05:14:21.660
Yes.

05:14:24.660 --> 05:14:26.660
Did I get the thing?

05:14:32.660 --> 05:14:33.660
Mm-hmm.

05:14:34.660 --> 05:14:36.660
Suspend points.

05:14:38.660 --> 05:14:40.660
Assassin's Guild challenge is complete.

05:14:40.660 --> 05:14:41.660
Okay.

05:14:43.660 --> 05:14:44.660
Uh, is that...

05:14:44.660 --> 05:14:46.660
Oh, Guildcrest.

05:14:46.660 --> 05:14:48.660
Stop, is there something new around here?

05:14:51.660 --> 05:14:53.660
This?

05:14:53.660 --> 05:14:56.660
We get little things.

05:14:56.660 --> 05:14:58.660
We get trinkets.

05:14:58.660 --> 05:14:59.660
Oh, my God, this game, I'm sorry.

05:14:59.660 --> 05:15:00.660
This game was made for girls.

05:15:00.660 --> 05:15:01.660
You're telling me.

05:15:01.660 --> 05:15:03.660
I get a little sim.

05:15:03.660 --> 05:15:05.660
And I get to put it in my little house,

05:15:05.660 --> 05:15:06.660
my little assassin house.

05:15:06.660 --> 05:15:07.660
Okay, sorry.

05:15:07.660 --> 05:15:08.660
I love this game so much.

05:15:10.660 --> 05:15:11.660
How did it know?

05:15:11.660 --> 05:15:13.660
How did it know I was a girl?

05:15:14.660 --> 05:15:15.660
Good night.

05:15:15.660 --> 05:15:16.660
Rest well.

05:15:16.660 --> 05:15:17.660
See you in the morning.

05:15:18.660 --> 05:15:19.660
Mm-hmm.

05:15:19.660 --> 05:15:20.660
Oh, this game.

05:15:20.660 --> 05:15:23.660
Gender norms go hands, my goodness.

05:15:24.660 --> 05:15:25.660
Ah, right.

05:15:25.660 --> 05:15:27.660
I don't really want to start Copernicus.

05:15:27.660 --> 05:15:29.660
We'll go by the Pantheon.

05:15:31.660 --> 05:15:33.660
Augusto, my Pantheon.

05:15:34.660 --> 05:15:36.660
We'll go by this because we literally do have a...

05:15:36.660 --> 05:15:39.660
I'll check the bank in case any interest is made.

05:15:40.660 --> 05:15:43.660
Accessories, Claire, I can't believe it.

05:15:44.660 --> 05:15:48.660
I can't believe I get to decorate those assassins' freakin' hideout

05:15:48.660 --> 05:15:51.660
with my Guildcrests for all my hard work.

05:15:51.660 --> 05:15:52.660
Ah.

05:15:54.660 --> 05:15:55.660
We know the target audience.

05:15:55.660 --> 05:15:56.660
Honestly?

05:15:56.660 --> 05:15:59.660
Is Assassin's Creed Brotherhood a girls' game?

05:15:59.660 --> 05:16:03.660
The only reason I say that is because it's, like, such a good game.

05:16:04.660 --> 05:16:05.660
Like, it doesn't...

05:16:06.660 --> 05:16:10.660
It's, like, so hard to get, like, genuinely to get stuck in, like,

05:16:10.660 --> 05:16:12.660
at any part is next to impossible.

05:16:15.660 --> 05:16:16.660
Mm.

05:16:16.660 --> 05:16:18.660
Oh, I need poison guards, actually.

05:16:20.660 --> 05:16:22.660
I'm just gonna, like, muck about.

05:16:22.660 --> 05:16:25.660
I don't want to poison, like, anyone in front.

05:16:25.660 --> 05:16:27.660
But I think they need to, like, pass away from poison,

05:16:27.660 --> 05:16:30.660
or it doesn't count, because I'm pretty sure I've poisoned quite a lot now.

05:16:31.660 --> 05:16:32.660
Um...

05:16:33.660 --> 05:16:35.660
Game's so good it breaks the gender barrier.

05:16:38.660 --> 05:16:41.660
Why is this one so goofy looking, honestly?

05:16:45.660 --> 05:16:47.660
Wait, are you saying if it's easy to...

05:16:47.660 --> 05:16:48.660
I mean...

05:16:49.660 --> 05:16:50.660
I don't know.

05:16:50.660 --> 05:16:53.660
I feel like whenever I see, like, a guy review a game,

05:16:53.660 --> 05:16:54.660
it's always, like,

05:16:54.660 --> 05:16:56.660
I love the challenge of this game.

05:16:56.660 --> 05:16:59.660
I love having to repeat the same thing, like,

05:16:59.660 --> 05:17:02.660
12 times over until I got, like, unspanked.

05:17:03.660 --> 05:17:05.660
And, like, I figured it out.

05:17:06.660 --> 05:17:08.660
And I'm, like, I just want a chill experience,

05:17:08.660 --> 05:17:10.660
like, make it through the story mode,

05:17:10.660 --> 05:17:12.660
and have a good time.

05:17:13.660 --> 05:17:14.660
And, like, yeah.

05:17:15.660 --> 05:17:18.660
I'm just a bad gamer that wants indie games.

05:17:21.660 --> 05:17:23.660
Not if you're a game journal.

05:17:23.660 --> 05:17:26.660
I feel like Brotherhood is such a great game that boy's angry.

05:17:26.660 --> 05:17:27.660
Yeah.

05:17:29.660 --> 05:17:31.660
My little cousin played it after watching me play it.

05:17:31.660 --> 05:17:32.660
So who is?

05:17:35.660 --> 05:17:36.660
Someone's gonna get beat.

05:17:38.660 --> 05:17:40.660
Then you gotta love Dark Souls.

05:17:40.660 --> 05:17:41.660
I mean, it's basically what you...

05:17:41.660 --> 05:17:44.660
No, Dark Souls is the opposite of what I described,

05:17:44.660 --> 05:17:46.660
and I know for a fact why it is.

05:17:47.660 --> 05:17:52.660
Because I have had the pleasure of playing Elden Ring with the Wreethlings,

05:17:52.660 --> 05:17:54.660
and the truth...

05:17:54.660 --> 05:17:56.660
You want the truth? I don't think you can handle the truth.

05:17:56.660 --> 05:18:00.660
I would not have been able to complete that game on my own,

05:18:00.660 --> 05:18:04.660
like, I just don't see how I could have done it

05:18:04.660 --> 05:18:06.660
without all the help of the Wreethlings.

05:18:07.660 --> 05:18:08.660
That's the truth.

05:18:08.660 --> 05:18:10.660
You think you can handle the truth?

05:18:11.660 --> 05:18:14.660
I need Poison Guards alone.

05:18:15.660 --> 05:18:18.660
I'll just poison them when I attain.

05:18:19.660 --> 05:18:21.660
I think I need to wait until they expire as well,

05:18:21.660 --> 05:18:23.660
which is the biggest problem.

05:18:24.660 --> 05:18:26.660
You just like your hand being held, didn't you?

05:18:26.660 --> 05:18:27.660
What?

05:18:27.660 --> 05:18:31.660
What do you mean that all these people are being so nice to me

05:18:31.660 --> 05:18:34.660
and helping me through my game and I get to reward them?

05:18:35.660 --> 05:18:36.660
Maybe I should do that.

05:18:36.660 --> 05:18:40.660
Like, every time we do a game where you guys hold my hands,

05:18:40.660 --> 05:18:42.660
like, I do a reward audio for it.

05:18:42.660 --> 05:18:47.660
And then, like, when I'm doing the ending part of the reward,

05:18:47.660 --> 05:18:50.660
I'm like, thank you for helping me, thank you for helping me,

05:18:50.660 --> 05:18:51.660
thank you for helping me!

05:18:51.660 --> 05:18:53.660
And then, then I pop.

05:18:55.660 --> 05:18:56.660
You know?

05:18:56.660 --> 05:18:57.660
That's terrible, I know.

05:19:01.660 --> 05:19:03.660
Can you poison on horseback?

05:19:04.660 --> 05:19:07.660
Can you poison on horseback?

05:19:11.660 --> 05:19:12.660
It says shoot.

05:19:13.660 --> 05:19:15.660
No, you can't poison on horseback.

05:19:24.660 --> 05:19:26.660
A spank in that horse, jeez.

05:19:27.660 --> 05:19:29.660
I'm not gonna hang around until I need him to expire.

05:19:34.660 --> 05:19:36.660
I wouldn't be able to...

05:19:36.660 --> 05:19:37.660
Wait, we played what?

05:19:38.660 --> 05:19:39.660
Elden Ring.

05:19:39.660 --> 05:19:42.660
Elden Rings are really good game to carry.

05:20:04.660 --> 05:20:05.660
Hmm.

05:20:07.660 --> 05:20:10.660
They're all looking in opposite directions.

05:20:11.660 --> 05:20:13.660
So I can maybe do two.

05:20:15.660 --> 05:20:18.660
I can maybe do three if I get this guy.

05:20:18.660 --> 05:20:20.660
Oh, no, I can't, they're both...

05:20:24.660 --> 05:20:25.660
That'd be amazing.

05:20:26.660 --> 05:20:28.660
Games should have some challenge, though.

05:20:28.660 --> 05:20:29.660
Yeah!

05:20:29.660 --> 05:20:30.660
No, I do agree.

05:20:30.660 --> 05:20:32.660
There definitely should be, like, some consequence.

05:20:32.660 --> 05:20:35.660
Or else, if you don't feel like any pressure to do anything,

05:20:35.660 --> 05:20:36.660
then you don't enjoy the game.

05:20:36.660 --> 05:20:39.660
Like, it's really hard to nail what kind of dynamic

05:20:39.660 --> 05:20:41.660
that you wanted.

05:20:41.660 --> 05:20:42.660
Like...

05:20:42.660 --> 05:20:44.660
Oh, I'm in trouble, I'm sorry.

05:20:45.660 --> 05:20:46.660
I am a naughty assassin.

05:20:46.660 --> 05:20:48.660
I didn't hide well enough.

05:20:48.660 --> 05:20:49.660
Unless...

05:20:49.660 --> 05:20:51.660
Dun, dun, dun!

05:20:51.660 --> 05:20:53.660
Oh, don't push me.

05:20:53.660 --> 05:20:54.660
Get poisoned.

05:20:56.660 --> 05:20:57.660
Plop, plop, plop.

05:20:57.660 --> 05:20:59.660
Get poisoned, get poisoned, bloop, poison.

05:21:00.660 --> 05:21:02.660
Everyone's getting poisoned around you.

05:21:04.660 --> 05:21:06.660
Oh, please spin that pole around.

05:21:06.660 --> 05:21:07.660
There we go.

05:21:07.660 --> 05:21:09.660
Okay, I managed to replenish.

05:21:09.660 --> 05:21:11.660
Oh, like, a ton of poisons, which is good.

05:21:12.660 --> 05:21:13.660
Oh, hello.

05:21:14.660 --> 05:21:17.660
You're going in the well for thieving from me.

05:21:17.660 --> 05:21:18.660
Goodbye.

05:21:21.660 --> 05:21:22.660
Um...

05:21:23.660 --> 05:21:25.660
You can come out now.

05:21:25.660 --> 05:21:26.660
It's okay.

05:21:26.660 --> 05:21:28.660
I'll come get you.

05:21:29.660 --> 05:21:30.660
I did not mean to do that.

05:21:30.660 --> 05:21:32.660
I don't think his life should have been forfeit,

05:21:32.660 --> 05:21:33.660
but...

05:21:33.660 --> 05:21:36.660
I mean, was it kinda deserved?

05:21:36.660 --> 05:21:37.660
I don't know.

05:21:39.660 --> 05:21:41.660
That was a bit morbid, so I'm going to be honest.

05:21:41.660 --> 05:21:43.660
I actually didn't expect that.

05:21:44.660 --> 05:21:46.660
Please, mommy, don't poison my iron brew.

05:21:46.660 --> 05:21:49.660
I have a can of iron brew in the fridge.

05:21:50.660 --> 05:21:52.660
Look at this!

05:21:52.660 --> 05:21:54.660
But it ages ago, and I'm still not sipped up.

05:21:55.660 --> 05:21:57.660
I need, like, the perfect meal.

05:21:57.660 --> 05:22:00.660
I miss British fish and chips so much.

05:22:00.660 --> 05:22:04.660
I'm sorry to any Aussies listening.

05:22:04.660 --> 05:22:07.660
Your fish and chips are rank.

05:22:14.660 --> 05:22:16.660
Okay, I did the court exam.

05:22:16.660 --> 05:22:17.660
Can I poison?

05:22:17.660 --> 05:22:27.660
Can I poison all you guys, and then push you all away

05:22:27.660 --> 05:22:29.660
so you don't do that fighting thing?

05:22:29.660 --> 05:22:31.660
I hate when they do the fighting thing.

05:22:31.660 --> 05:22:34.660
I think if they, like, hit each other with the swords,

05:22:34.660 --> 05:22:37.660
it doesn't count as poison, so I'm going to try and separate them.

05:22:37.660 --> 05:22:39.660
Oh, he just did it there.

05:22:39.660 --> 05:22:41.660
Mmm...

05:22:44.660 --> 05:22:45.660
No, I tried.

05:22:45.660 --> 05:22:47.660
I don't want to leave the vicinity too quickly

05:22:47.660 --> 05:22:49.660
before the poison's out somehow.

05:22:50.660 --> 05:22:52.660
Hey, I'm not going to find it with fish and chips around here.

05:22:52.660 --> 05:22:55.660
Yeah, Aussies use shark.

05:22:55.660 --> 05:22:57.660
Like, I think it's called gummy shark.

05:22:57.660 --> 05:22:59.660
It's not actual shark.

05:22:59.660 --> 05:23:00.660
Meat.

05:23:00.660 --> 05:23:02.660
It's just a fish.

05:23:05.660 --> 05:23:08.660
How do you call Germans Scottish?

05:23:08.660 --> 05:23:09.660
Oh, there we go.

05:23:09.660 --> 05:23:11.660
We did the poison guard.

05:23:11.660 --> 05:23:13.660
Rank five.

05:23:13.660 --> 05:23:15.660
Court is on...

05:23:16.660 --> 05:23:19.660
Did I say court is on poison people now?

05:23:20.660 --> 05:23:22.660
Ladies.

05:23:22.660 --> 05:23:24.660
I didn't know that.

05:23:25.660 --> 05:23:27.660
Am I in Australia forever?

05:23:27.660 --> 05:23:29.660
I highly doubt it.

05:23:29.660 --> 05:23:32.660
It's very good to run a business from Australia

05:23:32.660 --> 05:23:34.660
compared to the United Kingdom,

05:23:34.660 --> 05:23:35.660
but...

05:23:35.660 --> 05:23:36.660
Oh.

05:23:36.660 --> 05:23:38.660
Well, you're saying get down to me,

05:23:38.660 --> 05:23:40.660
but not to this wife over here.

05:23:41.660 --> 05:23:43.660
What's he going to say?

05:23:43.660 --> 05:23:44.660
No.

05:23:44.660 --> 05:23:46.660
Are you joking me?

05:23:48.660 --> 05:23:50.660
Yeah, it's good to run a business in Australia,

05:23:50.660 --> 05:23:53.660
but I can't see myself being here forever.

05:23:57.660 --> 05:23:58.660
Lance.

05:24:00.660 --> 05:24:01.660
Ooh!

05:24:01.660 --> 05:24:03.660
The British use haddock.

05:24:03.660 --> 05:24:05.660
It's a delicious fish.

05:24:05.660 --> 05:24:07.660
Are you in Australia?

05:24:07.660 --> 05:24:09.660
Yeah, I am.

05:24:09.660 --> 05:24:11.660
I'm doing a...

05:24:11.660 --> 05:24:13.660
I'm making a corn.

05:24:14.660 --> 05:24:16.660
I'm going to do a V-Tuber meet and greet

05:24:16.660 --> 05:24:18.660
in Australia.

05:24:20.660 --> 05:24:22.660
I did not look at what the 100% thing was.

05:24:22.660 --> 05:24:23.660
Oopsie.

05:24:23.660 --> 05:24:25.660
What's 100%?

05:24:25.660 --> 05:24:27.660
Kill your target with a hidden blade.

05:24:27.660 --> 05:24:31.660
Why is this mission tape so...

05:24:31.660 --> 05:24:33.660
so perfect?

05:24:37.660 --> 05:24:38.660
Hmm.

05:24:38.660 --> 05:24:39.660
Hmm.

05:24:39.660 --> 05:24:40.660
Hmm.

05:24:40.660 --> 05:24:41.660
Hmm.

05:24:41.660 --> 05:24:42.660
Hmm.

05:24:42.660 --> 05:24:43.660
Hmm.

05:24:43.660 --> 05:24:44.660
Hmm.

05:24:44.660 --> 05:24:45.660
Hmm.

05:24:45.660 --> 05:24:46.660
Hmm.

05:24:46.660 --> 05:24:47.660
Hmm.

05:24:47.660 --> 05:24:48.660
Hmm.

05:24:48.660 --> 05:24:49.660
Hmm.

05:24:49.660 --> 05:24:50.660
Hmm.

05:24:50.660 --> 05:24:51.660
Hmm.

05:24:51.660 --> 05:24:52.660
Hmm.

05:24:52.660 --> 05:24:53.660
Hmm.

05:24:53.660 --> 05:24:54.660
Hmm.

05:24:54.660 --> 05:24:56.660
So, Ironberg was well with fish and chips then.

05:24:56.660 --> 05:24:58.660
Ah, kind of.

05:24:58.660 --> 05:25:01.660
I don't know what the best takeaway...

05:25:01.660 --> 05:25:03.660
maybe unironically a Chinese,

05:25:03.660 --> 05:25:05.660
but like a British Chinese.

05:25:05.660 --> 05:25:08.660
Oh, I think I need to chase this guy

05:25:08.660 --> 05:25:09.660
from the rooftops.

05:25:09.660 --> 05:25:11.660
I think, yeah.

05:25:11.660 --> 05:25:13.660
It's giving chase from the rooftops.

05:25:13.660 --> 05:25:14.660
Hmm.

05:25:16.660 --> 05:25:17.660
Merda!

05:25:17.660 --> 05:25:19.660
What do you mean, merda?

05:25:19.660 --> 05:25:20.660
Get bonked.

05:25:20.660 --> 05:25:21.660
Hmm.

05:25:21.660 --> 05:25:22.660
Hmm.

05:25:22.660 --> 05:25:23.660
Hidden blade.

05:25:23.660 --> 05:25:24.660
Hidden blade.

05:25:24.660 --> 05:25:25.660
Lock on to him at least,

05:25:25.660 --> 05:25:26.660
Exio.

05:25:26.660 --> 05:25:27.660
Don't be afraid.

05:25:27.660 --> 05:25:28.660
Exio.

05:25:28.660 --> 05:25:29.660
Water!

05:25:29.660 --> 05:25:30.660
Exio.

05:25:30.660 --> 05:25:33.660
The only thing I despise

05:25:33.660 --> 05:25:35.660
is when you have to do, like,

05:25:35.660 --> 05:25:36.660
assassin.

05:25:36.660 --> 05:25:37.660
Can you come here?

05:25:37.660 --> 05:25:38.660
Yeah?

05:25:38.660 --> 05:25:39.660
Yeah?

05:25:39.660 --> 05:25:40.660
Yeah?

05:25:40.660 --> 05:25:41.660
No.

05:25:41.660 --> 05:25:42.660
No.

05:25:42.660 --> 05:25:43.660
No.

05:25:43.660 --> 05:25:44.660
Come back.

05:25:44.660 --> 05:25:45.660
Come back.

05:25:45.660 --> 05:25:46.660
Come back.

05:25:46.660 --> 05:25:47.660
Can I knock him off?

05:25:47.660 --> 05:25:49.660
Why are you trying to hit the air?

05:25:50.660 --> 05:25:51.660
Oh.

05:25:52.660 --> 05:25:53.660
Goodness sake!

05:25:53.660 --> 05:25:55.660
Stop moving a bit!

05:25:55.660 --> 05:25:56.660
Just accept your death.

05:25:56.660 --> 05:25:58.660
It's over for you, buddy.

05:25:59.660 --> 05:26:00.660
Stop it!

05:26:00.660 --> 05:26:02.660
Oh, actually getting teased.

05:26:02.660 --> 05:26:03.660
Stop it.

05:26:03.660 --> 05:26:04.660
There we go.

05:26:04.660 --> 05:26:05.660
My goodness.

05:26:07.660 --> 05:26:08.660
My tummy hurt.

05:26:08.660 --> 05:26:09.660
No more food.

05:26:11.660 --> 05:26:12.660
No more.

05:26:12.660 --> 05:26:13.660
Have you eaten too much?

05:26:13.660 --> 05:26:14.660
Can't forget.

05:26:16.660 --> 05:26:18.660
Have you had any encounter with local fauna?

05:26:18.660 --> 05:26:20.660
Ah, magpies.

05:26:21.660 --> 05:26:24.660
I have befriended wild magpies.

05:26:24.660 --> 05:26:27.660
Although I saw my first snake

05:26:27.660 --> 05:26:29.660
in a cockroach.

05:26:29.660 --> 05:26:30.660
Oh my god.

05:26:30.660 --> 05:26:33.660
There's no such thing as cockroaches

05:26:33.660 --> 05:26:35.660
in Scotland.

05:26:35.660 --> 05:26:37.660
And I met my first...

05:26:37.660 --> 05:26:38.660
And a possum.

05:26:38.660 --> 05:26:39.660
Oh my god.

05:26:39.660 --> 05:26:40.660
Possum are terrifying.

05:26:40.660 --> 05:26:41.660
I don't like...

05:26:41.660 --> 05:26:43.660
I thought they were cute.

05:26:43.660 --> 05:26:46.660
The noise they make at night is like...

05:26:46.660 --> 05:26:48.660
Te-te-te-te-te-te-te!

05:26:48.660 --> 05:26:50.660
Te-te-te-te-te-te-te!

05:26:50.660 --> 05:26:51.660
Very scary.

05:26:51.660 --> 05:26:52.660
Not a fan.

05:26:52.660 --> 05:26:53.660
Not a fan.

05:26:55.660 --> 05:26:57.660
Yeah, I had my first cockroach encounter

05:26:57.660 --> 05:26:58.660
and I'm like,

05:26:58.660 --> 05:26:59.660
I want to go back to Scotland right now.

05:26:59.660 --> 05:27:00.660
Thank you very much.

05:27:03.660 --> 05:27:04.660
Because...

05:27:04.660 --> 05:27:05.660
Oh my goodness.

05:27:06.660 --> 05:27:09.660
Possums are harmless if you leave them alone.

05:27:09.660 --> 05:27:10.660
Yes.

05:27:10.660 --> 05:27:15.660
I accidentally ran into one.

05:27:15.660 --> 05:27:17.660
That sounds really dumb.

05:27:17.660 --> 05:27:20.660
But my cat escaped the garden

05:27:20.660 --> 05:27:25.660
and I had to go into my neighbour's garden.

05:27:25.660 --> 05:27:27.660
And it was one o'clock in the morning

05:27:27.660 --> 05:27:29.660
and thank goodness I'm no in America

05:27:29.660 --> 05:27:32.660
because I probably would have got shot on sight.

05:27:32.660 --> 05:27:33.660
Oh, I'm in trouble.

05:27:35.660 --> 05:27:37.660
And it was absolute nightmare.

05:27:37.660 --> 05:27:40.660
It was freaking so dark

05:27:40.660 --> 05:27:42.660
and I had to run around

05:27:42.660 --> 05:27:44.660
to get into my neighbour's garden

05:27:44.660 --> 05:27:47.660
and there was a possum that was eye level in the fence.

05:27:47.660 --> 05:27:49.660
And both of us basically,

05:27:49.660 --> 05:27:51.660
like, both me and the possum were like,

05:27:51.660 --> 05:27:52.660
eep!

05:27:55.660 --> 05:28:00.660
But yeah, I had to dive into my neighbour's garden

05:28:00.660 --> 05:28:04.660
at 1am to throw my cat back over the fence.

05:28:05.660 --> 05:28:08.660
Yes, Gimli, I'm talking about you.

05:28:09.660 --> 05:28:11.660
Don't do it again.

05:28:11.660 --> 05:28:13.660
I never want to be in that situation again.

05:28:13.660 --> 05:28:16.660
I had to stick a letter through the freaking mailbox

05:28:16.660 --> 05:28:19.660
being like, I am so sorry if you heard any of that.

05:28:19.660 --> 05:28:21.660
The ruckus last night, that was me.

05:28:21.660 --> 05:28:23.660
No one tried to steal from you.

05:28:23.660 --> 05:28:27.660
And I had to sign it with my freaking address and everything.

05:28:29.660 --> 05:28:30.660
Her name is Gimli.

05:28:30.660 --> 05:28:31.660
Yes.

05:28:31.660 --> 05:28:33.660
Because she's Ginger.

05:28:34.660 --> 05:28:37.660
She's got Ginger on her, so I named my cat Gimli.

05:28:37.660 --> 05:28:42.660
So when I pick her up, I go, that's my wee lad, Gimli.

05:28:44.660 --> 05:28:45.660
Hmm.

05:28:47.660 --> 05:28:49.660
Excuse me, you said, well, the thing was,

05:28:49.660 --> 05:28:51.660
it was literally 1am.

05:28:51.660 --> 05:28:55.660
And like, they had the creakiest gate ever.

05:28:55.660 --> 05:28:58.660
And I'm like, I'm like, Gimli, Gimli, get here,

05:28:58.660 --> 05:29:00.660
Gimli, get here right now, Gimli.

05:29:00.660 --> 05:29:04.660
And because she had never been outside the garden before.

05:29:05.660 --> 05:29:08.660
And she got really confused.

05:29:08.660 --> 05:29:11.660
And was meowing at the door of the neighbour

05:29:11.660 --> 05:29:14.660
instead of coming back over the fence to me.

05:29:14.660 --> 05:29:16.660
Like, I had been calling on her for ages

05:29:16.660 --> 05:29:18.660
and I was trying not to wake up any of the neighbourhoods,

05:29:18.660 --> 05:29:20.660
like the neighbourhoods area.

05:29:20.660 --> 05:29:26.660
And I was like, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli, Gimli.

05:29:26.660 --> 05:29:30.660
Kill only Donato, big Donato.

05:29:34.660 --> 05:29:38.660
Nobody, no, like, unironically, I had to toss Gimli back into my garden.

05:29:39.660 --> 05:29:42.660
And yeah, she's not here.

05:29:44.660 --> 05:29:47.660
Oh, the music's gonna do the thing.

05:29:48.660 --> 05:29:51.660
I love the pickup of the music.

05:29:57.660 --> 05:30:03.660
Oh my God, veterinary care, though, in Australia is so fairly priced

05:30:03.660 --> 05:30:05.660
and so good.

05:30:06.660 --> 05:30:14.660
My baby boy, he ended up injuring himself on something mysterious

05:30:14.660 --> 05:30:17.660
and he had a cut on his leg.

05:30:18.660 --> 05:30:21.660
And I phoned up a vet and they were like,

05:30:21.660 --> 05:30:26.660
oh, we offer up a pickup service for animals.

05:30:26.660 --> 05:30:29.660
And I'm like, well, I don't drive, so that's perfect, thank you.

05:30:29.660 --> 05:30:33.660
I don't understand how you can do that, though.

05:30:34.660 --> 05:30:36.660
Wait, I need to kill only him?

05:30:36.660 --> 05:30:38.660
Simple.

05:30:39.660 --> 05:30:41.660
You can bowl a cat.

05:30:41.660 --> 05:30:43.660
What?

05:30:43.660 --> 05:30:45.660
Where are my pills?

05:30:48.660 --> 05:30:51.660
But yeah, I phoned up, I'm like,

05:30:51.660 --> 05:30:55.660
my baby boy's got a cut on his leg, I don't know what happened.

05:30:55.660 --> 05:30:58.660
Can I book an appointment?

05:30:58.660 --> 05:31:01.660
I was gonna have to put him in a taxi with me.

05:31:01.660 --> 05:31:03.660
Wait, wait, wait, wait, just becoming anonymous.

05:31:03.660 --> 05:31:05.660
Don't hurt anyone.

05:31:05.660 --> 05:31:09.660
Excuse me, good sir, I need this horse, I need the horse.

05:31:09.660 --> 05:31:12.660
Please give horse, horse now, thank you, bye.

05:31:12.660 --> 05:31:16.660
Ow, ow, ow, ow, horse, horse, come, horse.

05:31:16.660 --> 05:31:18.660
Let me on you!

05:31:18.660 --> 05:31:24.660
No, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone, don't hurt anyone.

05:31:24.660 --> 05:31:29.660
Nice, I'm coming in my own horse, this is gonna be ridiculous.

05:31:29.660 --> 05:31:34.660
No, don't run away, don't run away, I need the horse.

05:31:34.660 --> 05:31:36.660
Right, let's go.

05:31:39.660 --> 05:31:41.660
We're safe.

05:31:43.660 --> 05:31:45.660
We're safe, are they chasing?

05:31:45.660 --> 05:31:47.660
Oh, they're chasing!

05:31:47.660 --> 05:31:49.660
Oh, okay, okay.

05:31:49.660 --> 05:31:53.660
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I know which way to go, sorry, sorry, sorry, pardon me,

05:31:53.660 --> 05:31:56.660
excuse me, pardon me, come through, excuse me.

05:31:56.660 --> 05:32:00.660
Uh, right, which path does NPCs not normally take?

05:32:00.660 --> 05:32:02.660
That's one, I guess.

05:32:03.660 --> 05:32:05.660
Okay.

05:32:05.660 --> 05:32:08.660
And we lost them, we're going pretty far now.

05:32:10.660 --> 05:32:16.660
I'm still going, still going, can I go down here?

05:32:16.660 --> 05:32:19.660
Oh, we did it, okay, I'm fine.

05:32:20.660 --> 05:32:22.660
Let's go.

05:32:23.660 --> 05:32:26.660
We took a neighbour cat cat since she got on a fight in Toril Fathom,

05:32:26.660 --> 05:32:28.660
and I was like, give it away to her.

05:32:28.660 --> 05:32:35.660
Yeah, like literally, the health, the veterinary care in Australia is so cheap and good.

05:32:35.660 --> 05:32:39.660
And they were like, oh, we can like pick up your animal, and I'm like, oh, yes please.

05:32:39.660 --> 05:32:46.660
And I was expecting like $800 or something, and it was like super cheap, and they were so nice.

05:32:46.660 --> 05:32:52.660
And like, it was so quick until when I adopted him, that I was like, I'm so sorry,

05:32:52.660 --> 05:32:57.660
I have absolutely no idea what the temperament he's going to be, like please be careful,

05:32:57.660 --> 05:33:00.660
he might be aggressive, like I don't know how he's going to act, and they were like,

05:33:00.660 --> 05:33:05.660
oh, he was just like a sweet little angel, and I'm like, oh, thank you, I'm so glad.

05:33:06.660 --> 05:33:08.660
So what happened next with Gimli?

05:33:08.660 --> 05:33:15.660
Oh, well, threw her back over the fence, and now she's not allowed outside without me being with her,

05:33:15.660 --> 05:33:20.660
because she is a silly, silly sausage and gives me a heart attack.

05:33:24.660 --> 05:33:30.660
I unfortunately live like on car roads.

05:33:30.660 --> 05:33:38.660
Actually, one thing I'll complain about Australia is residential areas don't like have a speed limit,

05:33:38.660 --> 05:33:42.660
or the speed limit is ridiculously high, and I'm not being funny.

05:33:42.660 --> 05:33:45.660
The speed of freaking cars is ridiculous over here.

05:33:45.660 --> 05:33:52.660
It's very Americanized, sorry, sorry to be mean and stinky, because I should be really thankful like that.

05:33:52.660 --> 05:34:00.660
I even have like the ability to like, basically like check out another country type thing,

05:34:00.660 --> 05:34:05.660
like I should be grateful and all that, but it doesn't mean I'm not allowed to complain, so I will complain.

05:34:06.660 --> 05:34:10.660
But I'm trying to think that once, hold on.

05:34:13.660 --> 05:34:20.660
So you did, literally, what she did was climbed up a tree and jumped over a fence.

05:34:20.660 --> 05:34:26.660
So I basically, now she didn't get hurt before anyone's like, oh my god, you're,

05:34:26.660 --> 05:34:29.660
was it a linear or whatever her name was, 2.0 or whatever.

05:34:29.660 --> 05:34:35.660
No, I put her back on the tree, like I like sugled her back on the tree,

05:34:35.660 --> 05:34:40.660
and then I knew she was back in the garden, and then I had to run around and go back in,

05:34:40.660 --> 05:34:44.660
like in my garden and bring her back into the house.

05:34:44.660 --> 05:34:50.660
And obviously she was on time at like, she wasn't not allowed outside for a couple of days after that.

05:34:50.660 --> 05:34:53.660
We know you never helped me, yeah.

05:34:53.660 --> 05:34:55.660
Oh, sitting in the chat for me.

05:34:55.660 --> 05:34:57.660
Why you gonna go home?

05:34:57.660 --> 05:35:01.660
You go into a car crash, listen to the sheebie, you're joking.

05:35:05.660 --> 05:35:08.660
You're joking, you're in a car crash.

05:35:08.660 --> 05:35:11.660
You heard it here first.

05:35:11.660 --> 05:35:18.660
The violor is causing people serious damage to their health.

05:35:18.660 --> 05:35:21.660
You've heard it here first.

05:35:21.660 --> 05:35:23.660
Oh, we've done all the missions.

05:35:23.660 --> 05:35:27.660
So we can do courtesans, we can do these.

05:35:27.660 --> 05:35:29.660
We can do Copernacle.

05:35:29.660 --> 05:35:31.660
What's our DNA percentage now?

05:35:31.660 --> 05:35:33.660
62?

05:35:46.660 --> 05:35:49.660
Wait, the treasures count as 100%?!

05:35:49.660 --> 05:35:51.660
Ignoring the treasures?

05:35:58.660 --> 05:36:00.660
Hope you're okay.

05:36:00.660 --> 05:36:02.660
Did you have to like call the police?

05:36:02.660 --> 05:36:05.660
I think you have to report it to the police if you get hit.

05:36:05.660 --> 05:36:07.660
I'm gonna cry.

05:36:08.660 --> 05:36:10.660
Oh.

05:36:18.660 --> 05:36:20.660
Why are they doing that?

05:36:20.660 --> 05:36:22.660
Okay, Leonardo says 18%.

05:36:22.660 --> 05:36:24.660
I think that's holding us back on the DNA.

05:36:24.660 --> 05:36:25.660
Right, we're doing it.

05:36:25.660 --> 05:36:27.660
We're doing it, Leonardo.

05:36:28.660 --> 05:36:31.660
Oh no, Majobi's came back.

05:36:32.660 --> 05:36:35.660
You know, sometimes if you hold it, it goes away again.

05:36:35.660 --> 05:36:37.660
It's coming back.

05:36:42.660 --> 05:36:44.660
Where's Kaka Ann on when you need him?

05:36:44.660 --> 05:36:48.660
I had a really funny story for him, but I don't even know if he's here anymore.

05:36:49.660 --> 05:36:52.660
And it's the one that wanted to hear me fart in the toilet.

05:36:52.660 --> 05:36:54.660
I don't know if he's still here.

05:36:54.660 --> 05:36:57.660
But if he is, I'll tell you a really funny story.

05:36:57.660 --> 05:36:59.660
And it's really gross.

05:37:00.660 --> 05:37:02.660
Shit!

05:37:03.660 --> 05:37:05.660
Yo-yoing your poop?

05:37:05.660 --> 05:37:07.660
No! No!

05:37:07.660 --> 05:37:09.660
A little bit though.

05:37:09.660 --> 05:37:11.660
I feel like, oh, I think I've said this before,

05:37:11.660 --> 05:37:14.660
and this is the dumbest statement I'll ever say.

05:37:14.660 --> 05:37:17.660
But I feel like if you're a guy, if you're yo-yo, can you not like...

05:37:19.660 --> 05:37:21.660
stimulate your pee?

05:37:21.660 --> 05:37:23.660
Doing that?

05:37:24.660 --> 05:37:26.660
Use a smoke bomb to stun the overseer?

05:37:26.660 --> 05:37:28.660
Not overseer, sure. I can 100% not.

05:37:28.660 --> 05:37:30.660
Easy peasy.

05:37:30.660 --> 05:37:32.660
Yes, I do have a stun bomb on me.

05:37:33.660 --> 05:37:35.660
Locate the overseer.

05:37:35.660 --> 05:37:37.660
What? No comment.

05:37:37.660 --> 05:37:39.660
Literally, like, isn't that a thing that guys can do?

05:37:43.660 --> 05:37:46.660
Still surprised no one said, I'm doing it right now.

05:37:46.660 --> 05:37:48.660
Right.

05:37:48.660 --> 05:37:50.660
And then...

05:37:50.660 --> 05:37:52.660
Oh, we got a double assassination out of that.

05:37:52.660 --> 05:37:54.660
Oh, the others just disappeared.

05:37:54.660 --> 05:37:56.660
Right, we'll do any Leonardo.

05:37:57.660 --> 05:37:59.660
I've never felt good from...

05:37:59.660 --> 05:38:01.660
Well, aren't you in luck?

05:38:01.660 --> 05:38:03.660
I have a four-part trading series.

05:38:03.660 --> 05:38:05.660
See if it's for you, and if you finish the series,

05:38:05.660 --> 05:38:07.660
and you don't like it,

05:38:07.660 --> 05:38:09.660
then actually, you were right.

05:38:09.660 --> 05:38:11.660
It really isn't for you.

05:38:14.660 --> 05:38:16.660
Whoa, that's a lot of money.

05:38:17.660 --> 05:38:19.660
So...

05:38:23.660 --> 05:38:25.660
You stay away from the back door.

05:38:26.660 --> 05:38:30.660
I mean, I don't know if once you've done all those things...

05:38:32.660 --> 05:38:35.660
If there's really much of a point of sending them away,

05:38:35.660 --> 05:38:39.660
other than one, one, two, three, and four.

05:38:39.660 --> 05:38:41.660
Yeah, that looks good.

05:38:42.660 --> 05:38:45.660
Did she be heck on wheels?

05:38:45.660 --> 05:38:47.660
Not? Yeah, I might not have even done it,

05:38:47.660 --> 05:38:49.660
I don't know, honestly.

05:38:50.660 --> 05:38:52.660
Oh, I think I need...

05:38:52.660 --> 05:38:53.660
I think I need toilet time,

05:38:53.660 --> 05:38:54.660
but it's gonna take me like five minutes,

05:38:54.660 --> 05:38:56.660
because I'm a nervous poopo.

05:38:56.660 --> 05:38:59.660
I'm a nervous poopo when I sweep with some wheezing.

05:38:59.660 --> 05:39:02.660
That comes flying out of my nose.

05:39:03.660 --> 05:39:05.660
I remember I felt more embarrassed by a streamer in my life,

05:39:05.660 --> 05:39:06.660
because SUV man went,

05:39:06.660 --> 05:39:07.660
what was that?

05:39:07.660 --> 05:39:09.660
And I just went, listen to a podcast.

05:39:10.660 --> 05:39:12.660
Oh, are she bees in your ears like,

05:39:13.660 --> 05:39:15.660
like spitting on you and that?

05:39:15.660 --> 05:39:17.660
He's like, weren't you listening to me?

05:39:18.660 --> 05:39:19.660
Flying machine...

05:39:19.660 --> 05:39:21.660
Oh, I think I picked like the hardest one.

05:39:21.660 --> 05:39:25.660
Do not get shot while using the bomber.

05:39:25.660 --> 05:39:26.660
Okay.

05:39:30.660 --> 05:39:34.660
Do not get shot while using the bomber.

05:39:36.660 --> 05:39:39.660
Do not get shot.

05:39:40.660 --> 05:39:42.660
So am I allowed to be spotted,

05:39:42.660 --> 05:39:44.660
or is this a classic warning being detected

05:39:44.660 --> 05:39:45.660
because desynchronization?

05:39:45.660 --> 05:39:47.660
Okay, I need to go poopy.

05:39:47.660 --> 05:39:48.660
I'm nervous.

05:39:48.660 --> 05:39:50.660
I'm scared of this part of the section.

05:39:50.660 --> 05:39:51.660
Do you guys want it?

05:39:51.660 --> 05:39:54.660
What happens if we all take a job at the exact same time?

05:40:04.660 --> 05:40:06.660
I'm having lots of water,

05:40:06.660 --> 05:40:09.660
so I need to make sure the organs are all ready

05:40:09.660 --> 05:40:11.660
for this ball man about to drop.

05:40:23.660 --> 05:40:24.660
Okay, I'm gonna mute.

05:40:24.660 --> 05:40:26.660
I will be a few moments,

05:40:26.660 --> 05:40:28.660
so do forgive me for this.

05:40:29.660 --> 05:40:31.660
Who said link up or put mods?

05:40:31.660 --> 05:40:32.660
No, I'm just kidding.

05:40:33.660 --> 05:40:34.660
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:40:35.660 --> 05:40:36.660
Okay.

05:40:36.660 --> 05:40:38.660
I'm ready to poop.

05:40:38.660 --> 05:40:40.660
I'm pooping around.

05:41:02.660 --> 05:41:03.660
Okay.

05:48:11.680 --> 05:48:26.040
I don't know about you lads, but I came flying over me.

05:48:26.040 --> 05:48:30.960
I'm grabbing my cup of tea and I'm gonna make a honey tea, I'll be back in like literally

05:48:30.960 --> 05:48:31.960
a minute.

05:48:31.960 --> 05:48:38.960
Okay that was already boiling.

05:49:31.960 --> 05:49:54.120
Well, I have absolutely horrific news, I've not got any tea bags left, there'll be no

05:49:54.120 --> 05:50:00.040
honey tea for me and this has shot me, that was a moment for me to, I'm so sorry if you

05:50:00.040 --> 05:50:07.320
dropped in on that moment, we all collectively went for adobe, I can't believe I'm fricking

05:50:07.320 --> 05:50:13.160
out of tea bags, I'm so annoyed at myself, I'm gonna like, the one thing I do like about

05:50:13.160 --> 05:50:23.520
Australian supermarkets, they have big like stuff, oh my, calibration is off, hold on,

05:50:24.520 --> 05:50:30.520
there, that's my calibration, I don't know why I was looking all the way over that way,

05:50:30.520 --> 05:50:41.400
I have no idea if we're gonna be able to do this, do you want people to tell you when

05:50:41.400 --> 05:50:46.240
the other girls go live or when you ask for it, please always tell me when a girl goes

05:50:46.240 --> 05:50:59.360
live, I can't always keep up and I suck, right, I am not to be detected, interesting, if I'm

05:50:59.360 --> 05:51:06.960
not to be detected, wait what am I supposed to do though, locate the architect, but don't

05:51:06.960 --> 05:51:25.520
be detected please, okay, I, there's two together, how am I supposed to be able to navigate, you

05:51:25.520 --> 05:51:29.920
play some games where you versus the chat and hypnotise them so you win honestly though, I

05:51:29.920 --> 05:51:36.280
wanted to do an IQ test and then I want a chat to do an IQ test, like we do a poll for what

05:51:36.280 --> 05:51:58.840
the answer is and see what like the results are, are they gonna spot me, wait, wow, I love all the

05:51:58.840 --> 05:52:08.520
bugs in this game, full stop, I just love them all, game don't be detected, then why is that man on

05:52:08.520 --> 05:52:15.600
the roof, how bizarre, wouldn't work, we make you work the victory, oh no you guys are allowed to win,

05:52:15.600 --> 05:52:20.320
I wouldn't cheat to do it on the IQ one, but I think it hit me in the stream where I make

05:52:20.320 --> 05:52:26.680
y'all dumb, really good, where the heck am I supposed to go, I assume I'm allowed to kill folk,

05:52:26.680 --> 05:52:37.040
I feel like I need seven bolts, am I going crazy where, is he over there, is that him over there,

05:52:37.040 --> 05:52:55.040
I'm having a, I don't have a choice, yeah I was gonna say I don't have a choice because he was

05:52:55.040 --> 05:53:02.400
coming into the hay bale anyway, lower score is better right, I'm gonna be number one, chats IQ's

05:53:02.400 --> 05:53:10.560
room temperature, but that's why we're so good for each other, we're so bad, is that tracking funny

05:53:10.560 --> 05:53:15.960
to me, I think, oh my tracking is funny, I fucking hate this iPhone for some reason, sorry that I got

05:53:15.960 --> 05:53:24.960
really aggressive out of nowhere, whenever it is horizontal it does not track me full stop, horizontal,

05:53:24.960 --> 05:53:30.240
vertical, no when it's vertical it works, when it's horizontal it doesn't, but I need to charge it

05:53:30.320 --> 05:53:36.800
while I stream, and it's awkward to put it vertical, it's not tracking being rubbish all day,

05:53:38.240 --> 05:53:44.800
I'll just over enunciate my word, so you guys, I don't know where this enemy is genuinely,

05:53:48.880 --> 05:53:57.920
can I, oh it was me, pardon me for being so rough, I guess I can do this kind of stuff,

05:54:01.200 --> 05:54:02.400
and loot the bodies,

05:54:07.440 --> 05:54:10.800
could you get some sort of tool to grip it and hold it in there,

05:54:13.680 --> 05:54:18.800
oh, so it's on like the world's tiniest tripod which is adorable,

05:54:19.760 --> 05:54:30.640
I'm so confused, honestly, I don't know where this person is, I'm supposed to be trying to find him,

05:54:35.680 --> 05:54:38.400
I'm gonna loot these bodies and hopefully get more supplies,

05:54:38.400 --> 05:54:41.360
because one poison, one medicine wasn't a deal,

05:54:42.320 --> 05:54:45.920
I'm not good, the position of the arms is all wrong for the saltarello,

05:54:45.920 --> 05:54:49.760
please expire so I can loot your body, sorry, okay there we go,

05:54:51.440 --> 05:54:55.200
to be honest it's hard to tell if the tracking is off or not, since we don't have a reference,

05:54:55.200 --> 05:55:01.840
all right let me build my webcam lets, where is this overseer, is he like in, is he below the

05:55:01.840 --> 05:55:08.400
church or something, is he in it, is he the one by the hay bale, he can't be,

05:55:12.080 --> 05:55:12.480
um,

05:55:16.080 --> 05:55:17.920
have I been everywhere yet, I don't know,

05:55:19.600 --> 05:55:24.960
so those were the ones that caught me on the outskirts, is he in the center and that's why,

05:55:26.400 --> 05:55:27.520
no, what,

05:55:30.880 --> 05:55:40.960
is he like walking around and I just can't tell, yeah the game's telling me to stay in this section,

05:55:41.840 --> 05:55:49.040
I'm on podcast unless as long as it's your voice it's saying,

05:55:50.320 --> 05:55:53.040
love cuteness is smaller they are, the cuter they are, true,

05:55:55.600 --> 05:55:58.320
I'm, I'm one confuzzled girl,

05:55:59.280 --> 05:56:13.760
okay, look at that, I think we're just gonna have to literally go around the map and clean it up,

05:56:13.760 --> 05:56:16.080
because this is,

05:56:19.920 --> 05:56:26.560
use eagle engine to differentiate, yeah but I don't know what to tell you, nothing is being

05:56:26.560 --> 05:56:36.320
highlighted, oh there's guards coming, no they still, we're checking the hay bale,

05:56:47.360 --> 05:56:55.600
they're like, those guards from down there come any closer or no, yeah, we will shoot them with

05:56:55.600 --> 05:57:01.520
poison, like the game keeps telling me but I don't know what to tell you video game,

05:57:01.520 --> 05:57:03.360
I've literally been to all sections of this map,

05:57:12.080 --> 05:57:18.320
wait that didn't happen, okay, I hit them that time, I'm gonna loot their bodies to get all the supplies,

05:57:18.320 --> 05:57:27.200
oh they'll meet them first, closer to the larger area, is your target in the building?

05:57:38.320 --> 05:57:46.560
more poison there, the one thing that I'll say is a bit funny in this game, NPCs will walk into

05:57:46.560 --> 05:57:57.760
guards that are like flailing about and it's like, bro, hopefully I can get more ammo off

05:57:57.760 --> 05:58:03.840
these guys and I'm not spending more, I just get, I'm getting more poison back which is fine,

05:58:03.840 --> 05:58:09.440
if I'm spending poison it's good to get poison back, but am I getting,

05:58:16.800 --> 05:58:19.680
okay, I didn't, so he does just roam the map,

05:58:24.960 --> 05:58:31.440
okay, all those guards, don't want to be these things because I stopped,

05:58:34.800 --> 05:58:45.680
I didn't really see it turned back, I'm very confused with this mission, so like I had to

05:58:45.680 --> 05:58:51.440
find him walking around and there's guards everywhere, I'm gonna go on the roof because

05:58:51.440 --> 05:59:00.320
there's that rotating jewel here, there's, oh maybe a desync if he notices that people are ill

05:59:00.320 --> 05:59:11.360
with poison, I don't know, beat up the architect, okay, fuck it, I'll do it, hopefully this gives

05:59:11.360 --> 05:59:22.800
me like a loading point, give me the plans, right now, oh yeah, honestly me,

05:59:31.280 --> 05:59:37.840
that took so long to progress, I do apologize, that must be painful, right, so what happened

05:59:38.480 --> 05:59:46.320
now, I'm notorious, okay, I can deal with that, I've definitely progressed to the next loading

05:59:46.320 --> 05:59:51.360
screen, so again we've not failed 100%, do not get shot while using the bomber,

05:59:52.080 --> 05:59:59.760
surely I will do this first time when I get on the bomber, surely I will not have any issues at all

05:59:59.760 --> 06:00:05.440
and I'm not going to be frustrated with this game mode, I'm already preparing for it, can I launch

06:00:05.440 --> 06:00:14.960
on that, oh it hits you with a ver, oh sorry, I need time to perish like right now, so don't get caught,

06:00:17.200 --> 06:00:26.480
no I have no interest, surely absolutely health and copium, right, next loading point, yes please,

06:00:26.880 --> 06:00:37.520
oh I'm at,

06:00:37.520 --> 06:00:43.120
I'm to not be detected by the two guards that are across from each other,

06:00:45.840 --> 06:00:49.440
yeah, I'm not to be detected by the two point blank guards,

06:00:50.400 --> 06:00:58.560
I can do this if that citizen doesn't get in the way, and then he will be distracted by him,

06:01:01.680 --> 06:01:08.640
I said he will be distracted by the poisoned guy, can you, oh and now everyone's in the way,

06:01:09.520 --> 06:01:20.000
get the fuck out of my way, Jesus, I know why they make the minstrels like that,

06:01:20.560 --> 06:01:24.560
but they've made them a little too well, okay, they've made them a little too well,

06:01:26.800 --> 06:01:32.160
okay yeah my tracking is like bugging out because it's horizontal, I despise you,

06:01:33.120 --> 06:01:37.840
there's no way, or maybe it's the iPhone, hold on, give me, let me click for the

06:01:42.800 --> 06:01:46.960
my elaborate set up from yesterday, I removed all the cups from my ring, look at them ass,

06:01:47.840 --> 06:01:51.680
when I had the perfect set up,

06:01:59.120 --> 06:02:00.640
that looks much more,

06:02:03.120 --> 06:02:10.160
okay and then we'll look for supplies, the poor NPCs, I just know we're gonna fail this and I'm

06:02:10.160 --> 06:02:17.200
gonna be so mad, because I don't know what to expect,

06:02:17.200 --> 06:02:30.160
okay, these poison darts for distraction is absolutely gorgeous,

06:02:32.560 --> 06:02:41.680
these NPCs in my fucking way, not gorgeous, okay he's gonna start attacking, I can see

06:02:41.680 --> 06:02:54.480
the ones coming down the hill, I don't know if they're gonna, oh no, oh no they got attracted,

06:02:54.480 --> 06:03:04.160
I'm just gonna hide in here, unleash the archers, good evening skulls, I'm nervous, I don't know

06:03:04.160 --> 06:03:15.760
what to do here, I'm just kind of waiting around, waiting for the EI to kick in, so I don't know

06:03:15.760 --> 06:03:24.640
what to do now, oh yeah that, must have been drinking the good stuff, must have been drinking the good stuff,

06:03:25.120 --> 06:03:34.480
okay we're just gonna poison them both again, like literally poison darts are,

06:03:35.920 --> 06:03:40.480
yeah you know don't be afraid to lock onto them when they can see us, no it's fine, honestly

06:03:40.480 --> 06:03:49.040
don't be afraid, no I missed shit, we cannot be missing poison darts, no next one, use the other

06:03:49.040 --> 06:03:57.040
guys, okay there we go, we're gonna let these two bodies so we can refill our poison, we're taking

06:03:57.040 --> 06:04:06.960
it nice and slow, should charts start logging every bird, nah, okay these are both poisoned,

06:04:06.960 --> 06:04:13.600
again we're gonna pick up, we're just gonna take it nice and slow, you know we don't need it too

06:04:13.680 --> 06:04:19.120
fast, just relax, calming, cozy atmosphere,

06:04:27.920 --> 06:04:34.080
but remember don't get shot when we are in the glider and I know I'm going through do you think,

06:04:35.280 --> 06:04:36.880
I'll still finish it anyway, but

06:04:37.440 --> 06:04:43.200
no, oh yeah, wow you get a lot more from them, okay I'm quite happy with that,

06:04:45.120 --> 06:04:49.920
she be redirect, oh no they're all gonna see my terrible gameplay and me getting mad now,

06:04:54.320 --> 06:05:02.800
I'm gonna be region, they're gonna know I'm a terrible gamer, nice cozy atmosphere, remember the

06:05:02.800 --> 06:05:06.160
guys gagging and choking on the background, literally, I'm gonna just need a whistle to my

06:05:06.160 --> 06:05:14.720
teeth, whistle while you work, your gameplay isn't terrible, it's rough on the dlc stuff because like

06:05:16.400 --> 06:05:18.000
I don't know there's anyone up here,

06:05:18.960 --> 06:05:27.440
oh my gosh,

06:05:33.280 --> 06:05:39.440
I've just remembered how humongous this is, we have to get up there but we have to go like

06:05:40.000 --> 06:05:54.800
and do all this dodgy stuff constant back and forth, oh no, oh no, no he can't see us again,

06:05:55.680 --> 06:06:08.000
he needs to forget about us like right now, he needs to like okay, wow that was dangerous,

06:06:10.400 --> 06:06:16.880
hold on, I think we'll be investigated by another guard, right there's one in there,

06:06:18.480 --> 06:06:22.240
yeah and he's moving out, oh there's two of them, we're investigating the bodies,

06:06:22.960 --> 06:06:26.800
I don't want to go down, I'd rather stay on the walls and go around to this tower stuff,

06:06:27.200 --> 06:06:36.480
oh my goodness, she be caught and bummed herself, thank you for the wait,

06:06:38.000 --> 06:06:45.200

wait, both Emmy too, you both spend a stream at the same time, oh my gosh, hi guys,

06:07:04.000 --> 06:07:08.080
oh my god, you both ended stream at the same time, I don't know, maybe you should like kiss or

06:07:08.080 --> 06:07:15.120
something, geez, I don't know, maybe you should give each other a little kiss, if you're just like

06:07:15.200 --> 06:07:21.760
so in tune with each other, please, Emmy ready to she be, she be ready to do

06:07:23.760 --> 06:07:29.520
please get lots of water and food, she be, don't want you having any hangovers,

06:07:31.200 --> 06:07:39.200
hi Emmy, hope you both enjoyed your streams, hope you enjoyed your streams, we are currently doing

06:07:39.760 --> 06:07:48.400
Leonardo's missions and I'm currently debating if I'm actually capable of 100% in this game,

06:07:49.040 --> 06:07:55.840
unfortunately my answer is it might be, it might be a no, I don't actually think I have the

06:07:55.840 --> 06:08:01.600
thingy, just guarantee the vods getting nuked, okay, guys I'm trying to get you monetized on

06:08:01.600 --> 06:08:09.600
YouTube, right, I can get him, I need this archer over here done, yeah, okay, I'm glad that looks,

06:08:10.640 --> 06:08:15.200
that's good, is that a flag over there, I don't know, maybe just a treasure,

06:08:16.640 --> 06:08:25.680
sorry it's fine, I'm teasing, you guys can do what you want, but I'm not, I need to go there, what?

06:08:25.680 --> 06:08:38.320
Oh goodness me, que cosa, I actually think I want that guard to forget I exist,

06:08:42.240 --> 06:08:48.080
she seems so grown up, it's fine, we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood 2,

06:08:48.960 --> 06:08:56.160
which is a very beloved childhood game of mine, I believe Mercy's coming online in one, two,

06:08:56.160 --> 06:09:03.440
three hours, just under three hours, so if you are a snippet, you are welcome to hang about

06:09:04.400 --> 06:09:11.760
till it's mercy time, that's very, oh that guy up there, I don't like him,

06:09:12.160 --> 06:09:19.440
I think I'm gonna have to start looting bodies as well, because I'm running low on ammo,

06:09:19.440 --> 06:09:41.120
so that was actually rather humus, oh what a post to be left on, POV, you're a harem,

06:09:42.400 --> 06:09:44.800
that's the position she'd be gonna leave you in at the end of the night,

06:09:44.880 --> 06:09:50.160
yep no bad, it's already dead,

06:09:54.560 --> 06:09:57.280
wait it already got a warning, that was pretty quick,

06:10:01.040 --> 06:10:05.040
that was pretty rough, Jesus, I private it over here, ah I should have gone,

06:10:05.760 --> 06:10:09.040
ah let's see, let's do poison,

06:10:13.280 --> 06:10:14.720
oh let's not do poison again,

06:10:20.160 --> 06:10:27.520
oh she'd be making a smart move, five head move, this is so sad, I only got to see half of it,

06:10:28.800 --> 06:10:33.360
there's always more ASMR streams to come in the future, don't worry, it's not one and done,

06:10:34.320 --> 06:10:39.600
we're not, we ain't one and done around these parts, hopefully YouTube gets this stuff missed,

06:10:40.720 --> 06:10:46.960
there's a few things going on with YouTube right now, this is a very slow based mission

06:10:46.960 --> 06:10:50.480
by the way, because every time we poison I have to wait until they're perished and then I have

06:10:50.480 --> 06:10:54.080
to loot them and then I have to go for the next part, I don't know if I can reach anything here,

06:10:54.400 --> 06:10:58.560
just outside but I need him gone,

06:11:01.280 --> 06:11:03.520
I need him gone or I can't be jumping around this tower,

06:11:06.000 --> 06:11:08.800
he's out arranging these guys, but I'm not gonna do it,

06:11:08.800 --> 06:11:15.440
Strani you're always streaming, are you okay, ah yeah it's called, I am sharing my childhood games

06:11:15.440 --> 06:11:22.160
and I love them and I want to share them, it's a bit more cozy the day yesterday, I was a bit,

06:11:22.160 --> 06:11:22.880
can he see me?

06:11:26.560 --> 06:11:32.800
He can, man needs glasses, I mean Tuarev will literally let you upload, true,

06:11:37.600 --> 06:11:44.960
lovely, lovely stuff, we will be taking this very easy,

06:11:45.200 --> 06:11:51.680
I am not sure how to get

06:11:56.640 --> 06:12:00.160
out of safety, we're gonna be doing a lot of poison right now,

06:12:02.160 --> 06:12:07.600
I'm, I don't know if I can leap from there to that and I don't want to risk it,

06:12:07.600 --> 06:12:12.240
that looks like a leap over definitely, like that 100% looks like a leap over so,

06:12:13.120 --> 06:12:17.920
right they're currently poisoned below me, so I should be safe to make my,

06:12:20.240 --> 06:12:25.280
there's a lot of red there, I think this is definitely what I'm supposed to do though,

06:12:27.360 --> 06:12:31.520
a 12 and a 6 hour plus stream on your first week is all inspiring, I just really enjoy

06:12:31.520 --> 06:12:37.600
these video games, I definitely will be focusing, please don't think my streams like are all gonna

06:12:37.600 --> 06:12:41.600
be 18 hours, like tomorrow's needy streamer overload, I've never played it before but

06:12:41.600 --> 06:12:47.760
it's definitely gonna be a shorter stream because I don't even know if I like it and

06:12:48.480 --> 06:12:56.400
whenever like I have the, whoa, it's so careful, what happens if I spin around a beam

06:12:57.280 --> 06:13:03.600
and a, no need to poison these two down here, I'm not risking it,

06:13:04.160 --> 06:13:12.720
not risking it at all, we have come too far, right onto the beam,

06:13:15.360 --> 06:13:19.600
I'm just going poison route because poison stops them from being able to see me,

06:13:21.040 --> 06:13:30.640
and yeah, I'm gonna loot this guy's body because archers normally have a lot more stuff on him,

06:13:33.600 --> 06:13:38.560
called fish are venomous, there is one called fish is venomous but my ink isn't venomous,

06:13:39.680 --> 06:13:45.440
it's an aphrodisiac, it puts you under my alluring spell,

06:13:47.680 --> 06:13:50.800
that's so, what is bro doing, poison them,

06:13:53.280 --> 06:13:57.280
the lead artist for needy streamer overload is one of my favorite artists, I'm a sucker for

06:13:58.240 --> 06:14:06.400
oh his and she booty's stuff, right, we need to be super careful because this is the most

06:14:06.400 --> 06:14:12.640
ridiculous thing for trying to spot enemies, there's like guys all the way up this tower

06:14:13.440 --> 06:14:19.040
and it is so hard to know when one's about to see you and I'm not freaking redoing this all over again

06:14:20.480 --> 06:14:25.360
but I'm getting scared, okay I can see one guy up there, it must be there all on the roof

06:14:28.240 --> 06:14:35.200
under your lure, not your visa, you might have a streaming edition, I can't believe it,

06:14:37.120 --> 06:14:38.240
oh almost fell there,

06:14:41.360 --> 06:14:51.520
you said you might not be able to 100% it, there's a few 100% that I genuinely don't know

06:14:51.760 --> 06:15:00.080
and I'm worried about not being able to do my, like I just simply cannot do it and I can't

06:15:00.080 --> 06:15:06.800
like call, I can't tap one of you guys into the game to do it for me and so I've still, I'm still

06:15:06.800 --> 06:15:15.840
not sure this is going to be a 12 hour stream or not, I can hear music, how am I supposed to hurt

06:15:15.840 --> 06:15:28.640
them all at once, I don't think that, is that a flag this room, no what, the sun's getting further

06:15:29.520 --> 06:15:46.720
um, why isn't it, what am I supposed to do, no, oh, okay, okay, I understand, I thought I was about

06:15:46.720 --> 06:15:54.240
to be exposed right at the end there, right, in order to 100% this mission, do not get shot

06:15:54.240 --> 06:16:00.880
while using the bomber, okay, we have been at this mission for like 20 minutes now, all I have to

06:16:00.880 --> 06:16:08.560
do is nail this off the bat and I don't even remember freaking doing this, oh I'm going to start

06:16:08.560 --> 06:16:23.120
sweating, okay, don't get shot using the bomber, oh why can we not get like a little tutorial first,

06:16:23.840 --> 06:16:30.400
destroy the workshops, I can do that, I can do that, it's fine, tactical camera, no not tactical,

06:16:30.400 --> 06:16:38.800
that was awful, don't ever do that again, press retreat to fire, R2, oh no, oh my god I'm going

06:16:38.800 --> 06:16:43.120
down, this is not good, this is not good, oh my god, I don't know the controls, I don't know the

06:16:43.120 --> 06:16:53.280
controls, oh I don't know where the closest one on the map is, it's the one, if I take a right,

06:16:53.280 --> 06:16:57.600
I don't think I'm going to make it, just go for the one that I'm hitting at, oh my god there's

06:16:57.680 --> 06:17:07.280
archer towers, no no no no no no no no no no no no!

06:17:17.360 --> 06:17:23.840
I didn't even hit that tower, yeah, see this is what I'm afraid of, that I can't 100%, I'm under

06:17:23.840 --> 06:17:29.200
After the impression, I now have to redo this entire mission again.

06:17:29.200 --> 06:17:33.400
I missed that again?

06:17:33.400 --> 06:17:34.400
I'm trying so hard.

06:17:34.400 --> 06:17:37.520
I think I'm going to have to go further away.

06:17:37.520 --> 06:17:39.520
I don't think there's a checkpoint.

06:17:39.520 --> 06:17:41.520
I never gave an indication.

06:17:41.520 --> 06:17:48.000
Okay, there we go.

06:17:48.000 --> 06:17:51.120
Shoot workshop twi- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, my controller, Jesus.

06:17:51.120 --> 06:17:53.120
Oh, please, my goodness.

06:17:53.360 --> 06:17:55.360
I almost didn't make it there.

06:17:55.360 --> 06:17:57.360
I did that.

06:17:57.360 --> 06:18:01.360
Okay, then do this.

06:18:01.360 --> 06:18:03.360
And I missed, so that's okay.

06:18:03.360 --> 06:18:05.360
We just need to do it go around a bit.

06:18:05.360 --> 06:18:09.360
Oh, well, maybe we're going to just straight up attack this one.

06:18:09.360 --> 06:18:13.360
I missed.

06:18:13.360 --> 06:18:15.360
Whoa.

06:18:15.360 --> 06:18:21.360
Hopefully there is checkpoints because that does seem very harsh.

06:18:21.360 --> 06:18:24.400
I completely, I did, I will admit, I twided it all up.

06:18:24.400 --> 06:18:26.400
I'm going to get my own.

06:18:26.400 --> 06:18:28.400
I need a fire right now.

06:18:28.400 --> 06:18:30.400
Oh, goodness me.

06:18:30.400 --> 06:18:32.400
Goodness, gravy.

06:18:32.400 --> 06:18:34.400
They didn't even make this game easy.

06:18:34.400 --> 06:18:36.400
There we go.

06:18:36.400 --> 06:18:38.400
Destroyed that one.

06:18:38.400 --> 06:18:42.400
Honestly, this section was a lot harder on paper, I think.

06:18:42.400 --> 06:18:44.400
There.

06:18:46.400 --> 06:18:48.400
There.

06:18:48.400 --> 06:18:50.400
All right, now what?

06:18:51.920 --> 06:18:55.920
Only if you die, you have to repeat home missions if you play a port.

06:18:58.400 --> 06:19:00.400
A checkpoint at the start of the bomb.

06:19:00.400 --> 06:19:02.400
Destroy the bomber.

06:19:02.400 --> 06:19:03.360
Where?

06:19:03.360 --> 06:19:05.360
Oh, I see.

06:19:05.360 --> 06:19:07.360
Speedrun over there.

06:19:07.360 --> 06:19:09.360
Can we aimbot it?

06:19:09.360 --> 06:19:11.360
Three, two, one.

06:19:11.360 --> 06:19:13.360
Oh, I think that was a miss.

06:19:13.360 --> 06:19:15.360
A swinging a miss.

06:19:15.360 --> 06:19:17.360
Swinging a miss, swinging a miss.

06:19:17.360 --> 06:19:19.360
Hold on, let's try again.

06:19:19.360 --> 06:19:21.360
Wow, I cannot control this right now.

06:19:21.360 --> 06:19:23.360
I'm completely looking in the wrong direction.

06:19:25.360 --> 06:19:27.360
I...

06:19:27.360 --> 06:19:29.360
Bruv.

06:19:29.360 --> 06:19:31.360
Bruv.

06:19:31.360 --> 06:19:33.360
Bruv.

06:19:33.360 --> 06:19:35.360
Bruv.

06:19:35.360 --> 06:19:37.360
Yeah, okay.

06:19:37.360 --> 06:19:39.360
Controls, please, thank you.

06:19:39.360 --> 06:19:41.360
Oh, no, there's more.

06:19:41.360 --> 06:19:43.360
Okay, okay, it's okay.

06:19:43.360 --> 06:19:45.360
It's okay.

06:19:45.360 --> 06:19:47.360
I'm just trying to set a fire along the way.

06:19:47.360 --> 06:19:49.360
I am... Hello, game?

06:19:49.360 --> 06:19:51.360
Respond, please.

06:19:51.360 --> 06:19:53.360
I missed, and it's okay.

06:19:53.360 --> 06:19:55.360
It's okay.

06:19:57.360 --> 06:19:59.360
We're gonna bomb that, get a bit of speed.

06:19:59.360 --> 06:20:01.360
Whoa!

06:20:01.360 --> 06:20:03.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:20:03.360 --> 06:20:05.360
Whoa.

06:20:05.360 --> 06:20:07.360
Hello, game?

06:20:07.360 --> 06:20:09.360
Relax, relax.

06:20:09.360 --> 06:20:11.360
Game.

06:20:11.360 --> 06:20:13.360
I don't think...

06:20:13.360 --> 06:20:15.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:20:15.360 --> 06:20:17.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:20:17.360 --> 06:20:19.360
Game?

06:20:19.360 --> 06:20:21.360
What was that velocity?

06:20:21.360 --> 06:20:23.360
It was completely unnecessary, are you sure?

06:20:23.360 --> 06:20:25.360
Game, up, put me up.

06:20:25.360 --> 06:20:27.360
Put me up, put me up, put me up.

06:20:27.360 --> 06:20:29.360
I want uppies, so I can aim.

06:20:29.360 --> 06:20:31.360
I missed.

06:20:31.360 --> 06:20:33.360
Oh, whoa, I actually hit that.

06:20:35.360 --> 06:20:37.360
Wow.

06:20:37.360 --> 06:20:39.360
That was crazy.

06:20:39.360 --> 06:20:41.360
I don't think I was supposed to fly that high.

06:20:41.360 --> 06:20:43.360
That was insane.

06:20:43.360 --> 06:20:45.360
Oops, played it out of order.

06:20:45.360 --> 06:20:47.360
Where's this, a horse?

06:20:47.360 --> 06:20:49.360
Okay, turn around.

06:20:49.360 --> 06:20:51.360
Every now and then I get...

06:20:51.360 --> 06:20:53.360
Oh, I was too early.

06:20:53.360 --> 06:20:55.360
Maybe there then?

06:20:55.360 --> 06:20:57.360
Yes.

06:20:57.360 --> 06:20:59.360
Yeah. Okay, that wasn't bad.

06:20:59.360 --> 06:21:01.360
That wasn't horrific.

06:21:01.360 --> 06:21:03.360
Whoa.

06:21:03.360 --> 06:21:05.360
That was a crazy boost.

06:21:05.360 --> 06:21:07.360
I don't think I was supposed to go that high.

06:21:07.360 --> 06:21:09.360
I think the game mathematics...

06:21:09.360 --> 06:21:11.360
It's way...

06:21:11.360 --> 06:21:13.360
I don't think I was supposed to go that high.

06:21:15.360 --> 06:21:17.360
Okay.

06:21:19.360 --> 06:21:21.360
Because cool guys don't look

06:21:21.360 --> 06:21:23.360
back at explosions.

06:21:23.360 --> 06:21:25.360
Well, we did it.

06:21:25.360 --> 06:21:27.360
That was not easy.

06:21:27.360 --> 06:21:29.360
That was not fast.

06:21:29.360 --> 06:21:31.360
I am going to open it up in the DNA sequence

06:21:31.360 --> 06:21:33.360
to see if it's like, replay that section.

06:21:33.360 --> 06:21:35.360
If it is,

06:21:35.360 --> 06:21:37.360
then 100% is still on board.

06:21:37.360 --> 06:21:39.360
If it's not, then 100% is like a much less likely

06:21:39.360 --> 06:21:41.360
because this is getting hard.

06:21:41.360 --> 06:21:43.360
This is getting tricky.

06:22:05.360 --> 06:22:07.360
The whole thing.

06:22:07.360 --> 06:22:09.360
I was worried it would say that.

06:22:13.360 --> 06:22:15.360
I was so worried it was going to say that.

06:22:23.360 --> 06:22:25.360
Look, we'll do what we can.

06:22:27.360 --> 06:22:29.360
We'll finish the other Leonardo missions

06:22:29.360 --> 06:22:31.360
and that.

06:22:31.360 --> 06:22:33.360
But yeah.

06:22:33.360 --> 06:22:35.360
This is going to be...

06:22:35.360 --> 06:22:37.360
I don't...

06:22:37.360 --> 06:22:39.360
That has just like dramatically

06:22:39.360 --> 06:22:41.360
decreased the odds of being able to

06:22:41.360 --> 06:22:43.360
100% it.

06:22:43.360 --> 06:22:45.360
To go through all of that section again,

06:22:45.360 --> 06:22:47.360
I was taking my time poisoning guards

06:22:47.360 --> 06:22:49.360
along the way so I didn't have any issues.

06:22:51.360 --> 06:22:53.360
That one attempt

06:22:53.360 --> 06:22:55.360
and we got hit immediately.

06:22:55.360 --> 06:22:57.360
That was the only time we got hit as well

06:22:57.360 --> 06:22:59.360
which was just so unlucky because I wasn't sure

06:22:59.360 --> 06:23:01.360
what the controls were.

06:23:01.360 --> 06:23:03.360
That was so rough.

06:23:03.360 --> 06:23:05.360
Come on, that hurts.

06:23:05.360 --> 06:23:07.360
And that is why a late game gives more check.

06:23:07.360 --> 06:23:09.360
Literally, that is so...

06:23:11.360 --> 06:23:13.360
punishing.

06:23:15.360 --> 06:23:17.360
Wait, can you 100% this game without being online?

06:23:17.360 --> 06:23:19.360
Yes, the DNA sequence is what we're 100%

06:23:19.360 --> 06:23:21.360
doing 100% of the memories and stuff.

06:23:21.360 --> 06:23:23.360
I'm currently

06:23:23.360 --> 06:23:25.360
63%

06:23:25.360 --> 06:23:27.360
which isn't bad at all.

06:23:27.360 --> 06:23:29.360
However,

06:23:29.360 --> 06:23:31.360
I was under the assumption

06:23:31.360 --> 06:23:33.360
the game was a bit more forgiving.

06:23:33.360 --> 06:23:35.360
However, we've just kind of

06:23:35.360 --> 06:23:37.360
discovered

06:23:37.360 --> 06:23:39.360
the replayability checkpoints aren't

06:23:39.360 --> 06:23:41.360
necessarily all there on certain

06:23:41.360 --> 06:23:43.360
missions and

06:23:43.360 --> 06:23:45.360
that is just so...

06:23:45.360 --> 06:23:47.360
I don't know.

06:23:47.360 --> 06:23:49.360
I don't know.

06:23:49.360 --> 06:23:51.360
Let me see that.

06:23:51.360 --> 06:23:53.360
Okay, go ahead.

06:23:53.360 --> 06:23:55.360
Remember trying to

06:23:55.360 --> 06:23:57.360
platinum the game.

06:23:57.360 --> 06:23:59.360
Achieving wise...

06:23:59.360 --> 06:24:01.360
I don't know if you need 100% DNA

06:24:01.360 --> 06:24:03.360
for the achievements.

06:24:03.360 --> 06:24:05.360
War machines

06:24:05.360 --> 06:24:07.360
are infamous for a reason.

06:24:07.360 --> 06:24:09.360
Yeah.

06:24:09.360 --> 06:24:11.360
There's a difference between 100% and 100%

06:24:11.360 --> 06:24:13.360
achievements.

06:24:13.360 --> 06:24:15.360
So, yeah.

06:24:15.360 --> 06:24:17.360
I thought we could maybe attempt

06:24:17.360 --> 06:24:19.360
100% the DNA sequence

06:24:19.360 --> 06:24:21.360
but, yeah.

06:24:21.360 --> 06:24:23.360
It ain't looking good.

06:24:23.360 --> 06:24:25.360
I mean, how long? Oh, it's already been 6 hours?

06:24:25.360 --> 06:24:27.360
What the heck?

06:24:27.360 --> 06:24:29.360
Okay.

06:24:29.360 --> 06:24:31.360
Yeah, I didn't...

06:24:31.360 --> 06:24:33.360
I thought I was only going to...

06:24:33.360 --> 06:24:35.360
What was I supposed to do?

06:24:35.360 --> 06:24:37.360
Use a kick attack against

06:24:37.360 --> 06:24:39.360
the overseer. I

06:24:39.360 --> 06:24:41.360
literally thought...

06:24:41.360 --> 06:24:43.360
um...

06:24:43.360 --> 06:24:45.360
If you don't do it in a movie,

06:24:45.360 --> 06:24:47.360
this should be a thing you come back to

06:24:47.360 --> 06:24:49.360
at a later time. I think so.

06:24:49.360 --> 06:24:51.360
I think 3 days of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood in a row

06:24:51.360 --> 06:24:53.360
is a bit too much.

06:24:53.360 --> 06:24:55.360
But I'm perfectly happy to

06:24:55.360 --> 06:24:57.360
come across the save fail. That's not a problem.

06:24:57.360 --> 06:24:59.360
What was I supposed to do? Kick him.

06:25:07.360 --> 06:25:09.360
Oh, no.

06:25:09.360 --> 06:25:11.360
No, we're not doing this.

06:25:15.360 --> 06:25:17.360
We're not doing this horse feature, but leave me alone.

06:25:17.360 --> 06:25:19.360
You're scaring me.

06:25:25.360 --> 06:25:27.360
Whoa! I actually dodged that successfully.

06:25:27.360 --> 06:25:29.360
But the game said no.

06:25:29.360 --> 06:25:31.360
So...

06:25:31.360 --> 06:25:33.360
Oh, there you go.

06:25:33.360 --> 06:25:35.360
A true lover of this game with 100%...

06:25:35.360 --> 06:25:37.360
Oh, steady on. Have you seen what the requirements are

06:25:37.360 --> 06:25:39.360
on some of the missions?

06:25:39.360 --> 06:25:41.360
Oh!

06:25:41.360 --> 06:25:43.360
Is there a wee bit of a...

06:25:43.360 --> 06:25:45.360
Is there a wee bit much for me, honestly?

06:25:45.360 --> 06:25:47.360
Like, I love this game.

06:25:47.360 --> 06:25:49.360
But, I think

06:25:49.360 --> 06:25:51.360
definitely

06:25:51.360 --> 06:25:53.360
wouldn't mind coming back to

06:25:53.360 --> 06:25:55.360
it. But I think 3 days of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

06:25:55.360 --> 06:25:57.360
in a row maybe ain't the choice.

06:25:57.360 --> 06:25:59.360
We'll try Needy Streamer

06:25:59.360 --> 06:26:01.360
and it'll be a smaller stream tomorrow.

06:26:01.360 --> 06:26:03.360
Which means I can

06:26:03.360 --> 06:26:05.360
go get the

06:26:05.360 --> 06:26:07.360
sweets that I'm using

06:26:07.360 --> 06:26:09.360
for that hand cam stream. I need to, like, prepare

06:26:09.360 --> 06:26:11.360
for it and saw.

06:26:11.360 --> 06:26:13.360
I don't even know what to wear.

06:26:13.360 --> 06:26:15.360
Hee hee. I'm actually gonna have to put clothes

06:26:15.360 --> 06:26:17.360
on for one. See ya, pee.

06:26:19.360 --> 06:26:21.360
I don't even know.

06:26:21.360 --> 06:26:23.360
I don't even know what to wear.

06:26:23.360 --> 06:26:25.360
And one achievement

06:26:25.360 --> 06:26:27.360
requires you to reach level 50 in multiplayer.

06:26:27.360 --> 06:26:29.360
Oh, yeah, no, no. Not those achievements,

06:26:29.360 --> 06:26:31.360
like the DNA season.

06:26:31.360 --> 06:26:33.360
I'll be girlin' up neek.

06:26:33.360 --> 06:26:35.360
Pants, sewer, cry, mutually.

06:26:35.360 --> 06:26:37.360
Have to is a

06:26:37.360 --> 06:26:39.360
strong word.

06:26:39.360 --> 06:26:41.360
I think I have to.

06:26:41.360 --> 06:26:43.360
Open one of the first three games.

06:26:43.360 --> 06:26:45.360
The Borgia have constructed a deadly

06:26:45.360 --> 06:26:47.360
naval war machine based on Leonardo's design

06:26:47.360 --> 06:26:49.360
and must be destroyed before

06:26:49.360 --> 06:26:51.360
Chesery.

06:26:51.360 --> 06:26:53.360
The jeans.

06:26:53.360 --> 06:26:55.360
Talk to Eduardo.

06:26:55.360 --> 06:26:57.360
Ed Uardo.

06:26:57.360 --> 06:26:59.360
Ed Uardo.

06:26:59.360 --> 06:27:01.360
I assume this is a don't get caught.

06:27:01.360 --> 06:27:03.360
It's giving don't get caught.

06:27:03.360 --> 06:27:05.360
Yeah.

06:27:07.360 --> 06:27:09.360
I'm just a little fish.

06:27:09.360 --> 06:27:11.360
Look, look, look.

06:27:11.360 --> 06:27:13.360
No, I'm a fish.

06:27:13.360 --> 06:27:15.360
You didn't see me.

06:27:15.360 --> 06:27:17.360
I'm just a fish.

06:27:17.360 --> 06:27:19.360
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

06:27:19.360 --> 06:27:21.360
Swimming in the deep canal.

06:27:21.360 --> 06:27:23.360
Canal.

06:27:23.360 --> 06:27:25.360
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

06:27:25.360 --> 06:27:27.360
Fish, fish, fish, fish.

06:27:27.360 --> 06:27:29.360
I'm excellent.

06:27:29.360 --> 06:27:31.360
If you hold the block button with the

06:27:31.360 --> 06:27:33.360
floor ball and the horse coming out,

06:27:33.360 --> 06:27:35.360
you can knock the raider down.

06:27:35.360 --> 06:27:37.360
Oh, it says gasman prayer.

06:27:37.360 --> 06:27:39.360
Me, through, through.

06:27:39.360 --> 06:27:41.360
E.

06:27:41.360 --> 06:27:43.360
Clothes strong.

06:27:43.360 --> 06:27:45.360
I have six.

06:27:45.360 --> 06:27:47.360
Oh.

06:27:49.360 --> 06:27:51.360
Baby.

06:27:51.360 --> 06:27:53.360
It's you.

06:27:53.360 --> 06:27:55.360
Hello.

06:27:55.360 --> 06:27:57.360
I would like you to take me on the canal.

06:27:57.360 --> 06:27:59.360
Oh.

06:27:59.360 --> 06:28:01.360
You are the assassin, am I right?

06:28:01.360 --> 06:28:03.360
You must stop Chesery.

06:28:03.360 --> 06:28:05.360
I will help you.

06:28:05.360 --> 06:28:07.360
Let me take you to them.

06:28:07.360 --> 06:28:09.360
Oh.

06:28:09.360 --> 06:28:11.360
Like I said, I chose life today.

06:28:11.360 --> 06:28:13.360
Thank you.

06:28:15.360 --> 06:28:17.360
Uh.

06:28:17.360 --> 06:28:19.360
Interacting with the gondola

06:28:19.360 --> 06:28:21.360
will cause desynchronization.

06:28:23.360 --> 06:28:25.360
I scratch my nose.

06:28:27.360 --> 06:28:29.360
How tall are you?

06:28:29.360 --> 06:28:31.360
162 centimeters.

06:28:31.360 --> 06:28:33.360
Um.

06:28:33.360 --> 06:28:35.360
Taller than

06:28:35.360 --> 06:28:37.360
smoke bomb

06:28:37.360 --> 06:28:39.360
disables guards. Assassin or sleep

06:28:39.360 --> 06:28:41.360
fort wears off.

06:28:41.360 --> 06:28:43.360
Um.

06:28:43.360 --> 06:28:45.360
Excuse me.

06:28:45.360 --> 06:28:47.360
Am I not allowed to kill?

06:28:47.360 --> 06:28:49.360
No, I am.

06:28:49.360 --> 06:28:51.360
So why not?

06:28:55.360 --> 06:28:57.360
Uh, the gate.

06:28:57.360 --> 06:28:59.360
What am I supposed to do here?

06:28:59.360 --> 06:29:01.360
Nothing.

06:29:01.360 --> 06:29:03.360
Oh, he just jumped on. I saw that.

06:29:03.360 --> 06:29:05.360
I thought I saw that.

06:29:07.360 --> 06:29:09.360
Oh.

06:29:09.360 --> 06:29:11.360
Uh.

06:29:11.360 --> 06:29:13.360
Okay.

06:29:13.360 --> 06:29:15.360
Okay, okay, we're getting it.

06:29:15.360 --> 06:29:17.360
Taller than a smoke bomb.

06:29:17.360 --> 06:29:19.360
What's that?

06:29:19.360 --> 06:29:21.360
Banana or freedom? Uh, 5-3?

06:29:25.360 --> 06:29:27.360
I've not played Assassin's

06:29:27.360 --> 06:29:29.360
orgy, no.

06:29:29.360 --> 06:29:31.360
You're like me, also.

06:29:31.360 --> 06:29:33.360
It's just a weird class.

06:29:33.360 --> 06:29:35.360
It's just no flood me.

06:29:35.360 --> 06:29:37.360
Okay, something's a flood.

06:29:37.360 --> 06:29:39.360
I'm so sorry.

06:29:39.360 --> 06:29:41.360
I just pushed that man in the water

06:29:41.360 --> 06:29:43.360
and he drowned. I will say one thing though.

06:29:43.360 --> 06:29:45.360
If you're a gondola pusher

06:29:45.360 --> 06:29:47.360
and you don't know how to swim, isn't that

06:29:47.360 --> 06:29:49.360
a bit dangerous?

06:29:49.360 --> 06:29:51.360
Isn't that a bit silly?

06:29:53.360 --> 06:29:55.360
I didn't even realize I was supposed to be up here, also.

06:29:59.360 --> 06:30:01.360
Whoa, wait, why can he see me?

06:30:01.360 --> 06:30:03.360
I thought we'd purposely put these beams here

06:30:03.360 --> 06:30:05.360
so you can't get seen by the guards below.

06:30:07.360 --> 06:30:09.360
Hmm.

06:30:09.360 --> 06:30:11.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:30:11.360 --> 06:30:13.360
My pard in my bag.

06:30:15.360 --> 06:30:17.360
Look at that. Just so you know.

06:30:17.360 --> 06:30:19.360
Where is it?

06:30:19.360 --> 06:30:21.360
Oh.

06:30:21.360 --> 06:30:23.360
Pitching him wasn't the problem.

06:30:23.360 --> 06:30:25.360
It was like you touched the boat.

06:30:25.360 --> 06:30:27.360
I can't believe it. Fending Nemo?

06:30:27.360 --> 06:30:29.360
I touched the boat.

06:30:31.360 --> 06:30:33.360
How many slower, mate?

06:30:37.360 --> 06:30:39.360
Okay.

06:30:41.360 --> 06:30:43.360
Okay.

06:30:43.360 --> 06:30:45.360
Are you coming?

06:30:57.360 --> 06:30:59.360
The frickin' twat

06:30:59.360 --> 06:31:01.360
from across the street saw me.

06:31:03.360 --> 06:31:05.360
Yeah, you do that all the way again.

06:31:05.360 --> 06:31:07.360
You'd be surprised.

06:31:07.360 --> 06:31:09.360
I was in the Navy and it only passed the swim test

06:31:09.360 --> 06:31:11.360
because the

06:31:11.360 --> 06:31:13.360
Proctor wanted me to go home.

06:31:13.360 --> 06:31:15.360
Jeez.

06:31:19.360 --> 06:31:21.360
I think if you're Scottish, you have to learn to swim.

06:31:21.360 --> 06:31:23.360
You're forced to go swimming.

06:31:23.360 --> 06:31:25.360
Let's just run ahead of this guard

06:31:25.360 --> 06:31:27.360
because he can't see me at the corner of his eye.

06:31:27.360 --> 06:31:29.360
But I get out of range,

06:31:29.360 --> 06:31:31.360
which is good.

06:31:31.360 --> 06:31:33.360
Gondola logging.

06:31:33.360 --> 06:31:35.360
I've only got five poisons.

06:31:37.360 --> 06:31:39.360
I could probably just

06:31:39.360 --> 06:31:41.360
do that, man.

06:31:41.360 --> 06:31:43.360
I've got 19 crossbow bolts.

06:31:43.360 --> 06:31:45.360
They're quiet. I don't get it.

06:31:45.360 --> 06:31:47.360
So it's all good.

06:31:55.360 --> 06:31:57.360
That's fine.

06:31:57.360 --> 06:31:59.360
That's fine.

06:31:59.360 --> 06:32:01.360
So who?

06:32:07.360 --> 06:32:09.360
Okay, so this time the frickin' guy doesn't notice me?

06:32:09.360 --> 06:32:11.360
Yeah, that's what I thought, mate.

06:32:11.360 --> 06:32:13.360
I'm such a wee liar, honestly.

06:32:17.360 --> 06:32:19.360
He doesn't even spot me this time.

06:32:19.360 --> 06:32:21.360
Sting.

06:32:29.360 --> 06:32:31.360
I'm set to Scotland.

06:32:31.360 --> 06:32:33.360
We've got school soon enough.

06:32:35.360 --> 06:32:37.360
Oh, I need to go up.

06:32:43.360 --> 06:32:45.360
So you're going to see me?

06:32:45.360 --> 06:32:47.360
He is, so I kind of need to deal with you.

06:32:47.360 --> 06:32:49.360
Sorry, but you're in my way, son.

06:32:49.360 --> 06:32:51.360
You're in my way.

06:32:51.360 --> 06:32:53.360
You're in my way.

06:32:59.360 --> 06:33:01.360
You're in my way.

06:33:07.360 --> 06:33:09.360
Poison, huh?

06:33:09.360 --> 06:33:11.360
Just to get around the corner successfully.

06:33:11.360 --> 06:33:13.360
The Bluetooth device is...

06:33:13.360 --> 06:33:15.360
Why did you not go up?

06:33:15.360 --> 06:33:17.360
Go up.

06:33:17.360 --> 06:33:19.360
Go up and along.

06:33:19.360 --> 06:33:21.360
There we go.

06:33:21.360 --> 06:33:23.360
Much better.

06:33:23.360 --> 06:33:25.360
How's your gaming going?

06:33:25.360 --> 06:33:27.360
We MLG gamers out here.

06:33:27.360 --> 06:33:29.360
Unfortunately,

06:33:31.360 --> 06:33:33.360
I believe the 100%

06:33:33.360 --> 06:33:35.360
will not happen this stream.

06:33:37.360 --> 06:33:39.360
I did not anticipate

06:33:41.360 --> 06:33:43.360
how hard this game is.

06:33:43.360 --> 06:33:45.360
Because I've never attempted it before.

06:33:45.360 --> 06:33:47.360
I genuinely don't know how it goes.

06:33:47.360 --> 06:33:49.360
Right, I'm going to poison him and the other...

06:33:51.360 --> 06:33:53.360
Eh?

06:33:53.360 --> 06:33:55.360
Eh?

06:33:57.360 --> 06:33:59.360
I almost deseed,

06:33:59.360 --> 06:34:01.360
but I think I hit a checkpoint.

06:34:03.360 --> 06:34:05.360
I didn't...

06:34:07.360 --> 06:34:09.360
I'm going to show you now.

06:34:09.360 --> 06:34:11.360
I don't even know how you saw me.

06:34:11.360 --> 06:34:13.360
I'm up here.

06:34:13.360 --> 06:34:15.360
They're not supposed to be able to see you from up here.

06:34:19.360 --> 06:34:21.360
Yeah, like that guy really...

06:34:21.360 --> 06:34:23.360
There's like more to go.

06:34:23.360 --> 06:34:25.360
Oh, that...

06:34:25.360 --> 06:34:27.360
Get me in the war!

06:34:27.360 --> 06:34:29.360
No!

06:34:37.360 --> 06:34:39.360
I like that.

06:34:41.360 --> 06:34:43.360
That's a pretty good detail, huh?

06:34:43.360 --> 06:34:45.360
No...

06:34:45.360 --> 06:34:47.360
No...

06:34:47.360 --> 06:34:49.360
It seems literally drowning right now.

06:34:49.360 --> 06:34:51.360
He needs to catch a breath of

06:34:51.360 --> 06:34:53.360
frickin' air.

06:34:53.360 --> 06:34:55.360
Making him go under.

06:34:55.360 --> 06:34:57.360
Oh, goodness me.

06:34:57.360 --> 06:34:59.360
I don't know what to make of that.

06:34:59.360 --> 06:35:01.360
Oh, goodness me.

06:35:01.360 --> 06:35:03.360
They're not making this one easy, are they?

06:35:07.360 --> 06:35:09.360
Oh, my goodness.

06:35:11.360 --> 06:35:13.360
He took his sword out.

06:35:13.360 --> 06:35:15.360
I heard it, but he needs to breathe

06:35:15.360 --> 06:35:17.360
or else he pops up for too long!

06:35:17.360 --> 06:35:19.360
He needs to breathe.

06:35:19.360 --> 06:35:21.360
I need to breathe just thinking

06:35:21.360 --> 06:35:23.360
about how long he's holding his breath, honestly.

06:35:25.360 --> 06:35:27.360
Please don't do that animation

06:35:27.360 --> 06:35:29.360
where you can't breathe.

06:35:31.360 --> 06:35:33.360
We did it.

06:35:33.360 --> 06:35:35.360
Oh, for goodness sake, there's more!

06:35:43.360 --> 06:35:45.360
Breathe, exhale, breathe.

06:35:45.360 --> 06:35:47.360
Oh!

06:35:47.360 --> 06:35:49.360
Well done!

06:35:49.360 --> 06:35:53.360
One, two, three...

06:35:53.360 --> 06:35:55.360
One!

06:35:55.360 --> 06:35:57.360
Okay, I think maybe I can

06:35:57.360 --> 06:35:59.360
kill those ones

06:35:59.360 --> 06:36:01.360
because that was really rough, right?

06:36:01.360 --> 06:36:03.360
See, that was too much breath holding.

06:36:03.360 --> 06:36:05.360
Any breathers in chat?

06:36:05.360 --> 06:36:07.360
We stayed around.

06:36:07.360 --> 06:36:09.360
Mm-hmm.

06:36:09.360 --> 06:36:11.360
I'm going to Scotland in 2D.

06:36:11.360 --> 06:36:13.360
Whoa, wait, how far back are we?

06:36:15.360 --> 06:36:17.360
Huh.

06:36:17.360 --> 06:36:19.360
That's pretty far back.

06:36:23.360 --> 06:36:25.360
Okay, that guy doesn't care.

06:36:25.360 --> 06:36:27.360
Oh!

06:36:27.360 --> 06:36:29.360
I've just wasted so much time

06:36:29.360 --> 06:36:31.360
dropping myself back here, but who...

06:36:31.360 --> 06:36:33.360
Breathing is overrated, honestly.

06:36:37.360 --> 06:36:39.360
I know the game's telling me to swim under this,

06:36:39.360 --> 06:36:41.360
but, like, it takes so much freaking time.

06:36:41.360 --> 06:36:43.360
Like, that guy is going so fast

06:36:43.360 --> 06:36:45.360
in his wee gondola.

06:36:45.360 --> 06:36:47.360
Like, he knows that I'm literally trying

06:36:47.360 --> 06:36:49.360
to swim behind him in time.

06:36:49.360 --> 06:36:51.360
He's such a lot, like...

06:36:51.360 --> 06:36:53.360
You know I'm freaking behind you.

06:36:53.360 --> 06:36:55.360
Slow it down!

06:36:57.360 --> 06:36:59.360
Literally, I'm trying to, like, silently swim.

06:36:59.360 --> 06:37:01.360
It's not even possible.

06:37:05.360 --> 06:37:07.360
I think if I just hang off

06:37:07.360 --> 06:37:09.360
the pier and assassinate him,

06:37:09.360 --> 06:37:11.360
this is the best way forward for this.

06:37:11.360 --> 06:37:13.360
Sorry, mate, but time's up.

06:37:15.360 --> 06:37:17.360
Okay, yeah, that is far more easier.

06:37:17.360 --> 06:37:19.360
I just need to do it to the other guy on the pier.

06:37:19.360 --> 06:37:21.360
Sorry!

06:37:23.360 --> 06:37:25.360
Oxygen addicts, honestly.

06:37:25.360 --> 06:37:27.360
Can't get enough of it.

06:37:27.360 --> 06:37:29.360
You're so greedy, huh?

06:37:29.360 --> 06:37:31.360
So greedy for more...

06:37:31.360 --> 06:37:33.360
more oxygen.

06:37:35.360 --> 06:37:37.360
Okay, let's dive.

06:37:37.360 --> 06:37:39.360
And then breathe.

06:37:39.360 --> 06:37:41.360
And then dive.

06:37:41.360 --> 06:37:43.360
And then breathe.

06:37:43.360 --> 06:37:45.360
And then yank.

06:37:45.360 --> 06:37:47.360
Ezio, please do not go on the platform

06:37:47.360 --> 06:37:49.360
when it comes to assassinating...

06:37:49.360 --> 06:37:51.360
freaking gods!

06:37:53.360 --> 06:37:55.360
Ezio.

06:37:55.360 --> 06:37:57.360
You knew!

06:37:57.360 --> 06:37:59.360
Fine well. I was asking you to pull him

06:37:59.360 --> 06:38:01.360
into the water.

06:38:01.360 --> 06:38:03.360
Not get on the platform

06:38:03.360 --> 06:38:05.360
where the freaking AI

06:38:05.360 --> 06:38:07.360
is so sensitive

06:38:07.360 --> 06:38:09.360
and on the lookout

06:38:09.360 --> 06:38:11.360
on freaking...

06:38:11.360 --> 06:38:13.360
YOU FREAKING FREAKS!

06:38:13.360 --> 06:38:15.360
Right, I'm just a serious

06:38:15.360 --> 06:38:17.360
assassinating spam, honestly.

06:38:17.360 --> 06:38:19.360
Game knows... oh, and he's gonna

06:38:19.360 --> 06:38:21.360
fuck you.

06:38:25.360 --> 06:38:27.360
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

06:38:27.360 --> 06:38:29.360
And I'm out of honey tea

06:38:29.360 --> 06:38:31.360
and I'm sad that I can't have

06:38:31.360 --> 06:38:33.360
a freaking honey tube.

06:38:33.360 --> 06:38:35.360
Gonna have to go to the shops.

06:38:37.360 --> 06:38:39.360
Okay.

06:38:41.360 --> 06:38:43.360
Right, I can take my time to this segment.

06:38:43.360 --> 06:38:45.360
I've never been caught at it yet

06:38:45.360 --> 06:38:47.360
so let's not go caught now.

06:38:47.360 --> 06:38:49.360
We swimming!

06:38:49.360 --> 06:38:51.360
Any swimmers?

06:38:51.360 --> 06:38:53.360
You got any swimmers for me?

06:38:53.360 --> 06:38:55.360
Shopping.

06:38:55.360 --> 06:38:57.360
That's how it is, just that, honestly.

06:38:57.360 --> 06:38:59.360
I feel like if I fast swim

06:38:59.360 --> 06:39:01.360
I might alert him.

06:39:01.360 --> 06:39:03.360
Now, if I am correct

06:39:03.360 --> 06:39:05.360
what the problem was

06:39:05.360 --> 06:39:07.360
is that I assassinated here.

06:39:07.360 --> 06:39:09.360
I need to hang off and then assassinate.

06:39:09.360 --> 06:39:11.360
Yeah!

06:39:11.360 --> 06:39:13.360
But you knew exactly what I wanted to

06:39:13.360 --> 06:39:15.360
achieve, so don't even look at me, okay?

06:39:15.360 --> 06:39:17.360
Don't interact with the gondola.

06:39:17.360 --> 06:39:19.360
Me swimmers!

06:39:19.360 --> 06:39:21.360
My story.

06:39:23.360 --> 06:39:25.360
Alright, let's...

06:39:25.360 --> 06:39:27.360
Okay.

06:39:33.360 --> 06:39:35.360
Why is he gulping?

06:39:35.360 --> 06:39:37.360
I'm not even diving in.

06:39:37.360 --> 06:39:39.360
Okay.

06:39:39.360 --> 06:39:41.360
Hang off the ledge, please.

06:39:41.360 --> 06:39:43.360
One assassination, please.

06:39:43.360 --> 06:39:45.360
Back in the war.

06:39:45.360 --> 06:39:47.360
Dive.

06:39:47.360 --> 06:39:49.360
Dive over the ropes.

06:39:49.360 --> 06:39:51.360
Don't be afraid.

06:39:51.360 --> 06:39:53.360
Don't be afraid of the ropes.

06:39:53.360 --> 06:39:55.360
That was very talented.

06:40:09.360 --> 06:40:11.360
My life flash before my...

06:40:11.360 --> 06:40:13.360
Someone say ropes.

06:40:13.360 --> 06:40:15.360
She's still alive.

06:40:15.360 --> 06:40:17.360
Especially not past that drunk.

06:40:17.360 --> 06:40:19.360
I don't know if you're drunk.

06:40:19.360 --> 06:40:21.360
I was not supposed to...

06:40:21.360 --> 06:40:23.360
That's all I want to see, baby.

06:40:25.360 --> 06:40:27.360
Okay, there we go.

06:40:29.360 --> 06:40:31.360
Detection is now permitted.

06:40:31.360 --> 06:40:33.360
Yee-haw!

06:40:33.360 --> 06:40:35.360
Time to perish, boys!

06:40:39.360 --> 06:40:41.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you want some of this?

06:40:43.360 --> 06:40:45.360
I kicked it.

06:40:45.360 --> 06:40:47.360
Actually, I need to disarm guards

06:40:47.360 --> 06:40:49.360
and kill them with their own weapon.

06:40:49.360 --> 06:40:51.360
Let's do that.

06:40:51.360 --> 06:40:53.360
Give me that sword, please.

06:40:53.360 --> 06:40:55.360
Yee, thank you very much.

06:40:55.360 --> 06:40:57.360
Drop object.

06:40:57.360 --> 06:40:59.360
And then we're going to do it again.

06:40:59.360 --> 06:41:01.360
Can I steal your weapon?

06:41:01.360 --> 06:41:03.360
Oh, it's not fighting over the weapon.

06:41:03.360 --> 06:41:05.360
Okay, there we go.

06:41:05.360 --> 06:41:07.360
He wouldn't go over it, honestly.

06:41:07.360 --> 06:41:09.360
I wouldn't go my weapon to if I had one.

06:41:09.360 --> 06:41:11.360
Now I'm chilling, cleaning up and watching

06:41:11.360 --> 06:41:13.360
because I love these people.

06:41:13.360 --> 06:41:15.360
Azura said she played it as well.

06:41:15.360 --> 06:41:17.360
Emmy said she got it as gifted,

06:41:17.360 --> 06:41:19.360
but she never played it.

06:41:21.360 --> 06:41:23.360
Good night.

06:41:23.360 --> 06:41:25.360
Those who rest, thank you for hanging in.

06:41:29.360 --> 06:41:31.360
I love when I can be detected.

06:41:31.360 --> 06:41:33.360
It's so fun.

06:41:35.360 --> 06:41:37.360
Come on, who wants to first, then?

06:41:39.360 --> 06:41:41.360
Okay, there you go.

06:41:41.360 --> 06:41:43.360
Oh, no, don't grab me. Who wants to first?

06:41:43.360 --> 06:41:45.360
You!

06:41:47.360 --> 06:41:49.360
Ugh!

06:41:49.360 --> 06:41:51.360
Take that.

06:41:51.360 --> 06:41:53.360
And this!

06:41:53.360 --> 06:41:55.360
And you're another one!

06:41:55.360 --> 06:41:57.360
I love the crisscross kill.

06:41:57.360 --> 06:41:59.360
It's so cool.

06:41:59.360 --> 06:42:01.360
Oh, wait, I'm actually going to loot because those were pretty high.

06:42:01.360 --> 06:42:03.360
Guard.

06:42:07.360 --> 06:42:09.360
These guys act like they understand you're the main character

06:42:09.360 --> 06:42:11.360
on a flittle.

06:42:17.360 --> 06:42:19.360
Okay.

06:42:19.360 --> 06:42:21.360
I thought I got more poison holdings.

06:42:33.360 --> 06:42:35.360
Once we've done other Leonardo missions,

06:42:35.360 --> 06:42:37.360
I think we'll do all of the factions

06:42:37.360 --> 06:42:39.360
because I want to dress up my Assassin's Creed guild.

06:42:43.360 --> 06:42:45.360
So it's girly pop, you know what I'm saying?

06:42:47.360 --> 06:42:49.360
How do I get up there?

06:42:49.360 --> 06:42:51.360
Or do I just leap?

06:42:51.360 --> 06:42:53.360
Do I do a leap?

06:42:53.360 --> 06:42:55.360
Oh, that was a big leap.

06:42:55.360 --> 06:42:57.360
I don't think you should have been able to do that.

06:42:57.360 --> 06:42:59.360
Hey, ho.

06:42:59.360 --> 06:43:01.360
You can't see me because you're dead by the time

06:43:01.360 --> 06:43:03.360
you process it. It's me!

06:43:03.360 --> 06:43:05.360
Daddy's home!

06:43:05.360 --> 06:43:07.360
Let's loot.

06:43:07.360 --> 06:43:09.360
He may have poison on him.

06:43:11.360 --> 06:43:13.360
They accepted that.

06:43:17.360 --> 06:43:19.360
I'm going to go see you in the morning.

06:43:19.360 --> 06:43:21.360
Oh, that's hilarious.

06:43:21.360 --> 06:43:23.360
I'm focusing on that now.

06:43:23.360 --> 06:43:25.360
Literally, good night. See you in the morning.

06:43:25.360 --> 06:43:27.360
I'll still be online. Sweet dreams.

06:43:27.360 --> 06:43:29.360
Have a good rest.

06:43:29.360 --> 06:43:31.360
I'll still be here on Assassin's Creed on my knees.

06:43:35.360 --> 06:43:37.360
Daddy's home.

06:43:39.360 --> 06:43:41.360
They're more like guidelines than actual rules.

06:43:47.360 --> 06:43:49.360
Oh, I do love this game.

06:43:53.360 --> 06:43:55.360
That reason I did go watch

06:43:55.360 --> 06:43:57.360
and get him out of it alive.

06:44:09.360 --> 06:44:11.360
What's this?

06:44:13.360 --> 06:44:15.360
What a switch.

06:44:17.360 --> 06:44:19.360
Wow, I have to switch between rowing

06:44:19.360 --> 06:44:21.360
and aiming.

06:44:21.360 --> 06:44:23.360
I mean, I guess I comprehend that.

06:44:23.360 --> 06:44:25.360
But, sheesh.

06:44:25.360 --> 06:44:27.360
Oh, we're taking down ships!

06:44:29.360 --> 06:44:31.360
Boo Templars.

06:44:31.360 --> 06:44:33.360
Stinky Templars.

06:44:33.360 --> 06:44:35.360
Switch, fire!

06:44:35.360 --> 06:44:37.360
Oh my gosh, that's so cool.

06:44:37.360 --> 06:44:39.360
Okay, sales destroyed.

06:44:39.360 --> 06:44:41.360
That makes sense.

06:44:41.360 --> 06:44:43.360
Won that one?

06:44:43.360 --> 06:44:45.360
I only hit one of them there.

06:44:45.360 --> 06:44:47.360
I'm getting wrecked right now.

06:44:49.360 --> 06:44:51.360
All done.

06:44:51.360 --> 06:44:53.360
Bye-bye!

06:44:53.360 --> 06:44:55.360
Okay, okay, I like it. I'm digging it.

06:44:55.360 --> 06:44:57.360
I'm digging it.

06:44:57.360 --> 06:44:59.360
Oh my gosh!

06:44:59.360 --> 06:45:01.360
They're like ragdolling off the ship.

06:45:03.360 --> 06:45:05.360
Okay, that was cool.

06:45:05.360 --> 06:45:07.360
I enjoyed that.

06:45:07.360 --> 06:45:09.360
Yo ho ho.

06:45:09.360 --> 06:45:11.360
It's a pirate's life for me.

06:45:11.360 --> 06:45:13.360
A tweedalidum.

06:45:13.360 --> 06:45:15.360
A tweedalidum.

06:45:15.360 --> 06:45:17.360
Tweedalidiliwi.

06:45:17.360 --> 06:45:19.360
I don't know the words. I just know the shanty.

06:45:19.360 --> 06:45:21.360
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho!

06:45:25.360 --> 06:45:27.360
Okay, it looks like there's just three.

06:45:27.360 --> 06:45:31.360
And I have plenty of health, so that's fine.

06:45:33.360 --> 06:45:35.360
Give me fuel in my fire.

06:45:35.360 --> 06:45:37.360
Give me burning.

06:45:37.360 --> 06:45:39.360
Put some oil in my land.

06:45:39.360 --> 06:45:41.360
Eye free.

06:45:41.360 --> 06:45:43.360
Okay.

06:45:43.360 --> 06:45:45.360
Can I do it from here?

06:45:47.360 --> 06:45:49.360
Possibly.

06:45:49.360 --> 06:45:51.360
Can I do all three though?

06:45:53.360 --> 06:45:55.360
I think I'm gonna have to go a bit closer to this one.

06:45:55.360 --> 06:45:57.360
At the back here.

06:45:57.360 --> 06:45:59.360
I think that's it.

06:45:59.360 --> 06:46:01.360
That should be good.

06:46:01.360 --> 06:46:03.360
No? I didn't hit it?

06:46:03.360 --> 06:46:05.360
Oopsies.

06:46:05.360 --> 06:46:07.360
Okay, there we go.

06:46:23.360 --> 06:46:25.360
I don't think you can go back through,

06:46:25.360 --> 06:46:27.360
so we're just gonna...

06:46:27.360 --> 06:46:29.360
do our thing.

06:46:31.360 --> 06:46:33.360
You are now notorious,

06:46:33.360 --> 06:46:35.360
for throwing high alert.

06:46:35.360 --> 06:46:37.360
I should hope so.

06:46:37.360 --> 06:46:39.360
Because I'm still here.

06:46:39.360 --> 06:46:41.360
Oh, they knocked me off my gun.

06:46:41.360 --> 06:46:43.360
I don't even know what to do about it.

06:46:43.360 --> 06:46:45.360
Hold on, lads. I need to rotate before I destroy his.

06:46:45.360 --> 06:46:47.360
Dude, give me a second.

06:46:47.360 --> 06:46:49.360
We just need to rotate.

06:46:49.360 --> 06:46:51.360
I actually don't think I can hit it from this distance.

06:46:51.360 --> 06:46:53.360
You know that?

06:46:53.360 --> 06:46:55.360
Ow, I'm...

06:46:55.360 --> 06:46:57.360
Wait, whoa, what's happening?

06:46:57.360 --> 06:46:59.360
Okay, hold on.

06:46:59.360 --> 06:47:01.360
Hold on. We need to do a big old circle around.

06:47:01.360 --> 06:47:03.360
Cause...

06:47:03.360 --> 06:47:05.360
I'm like...

06:47:05.360 --> 06:47:07.360
too close.

06:47:07.360 --> 06:47:09.360
To even hit this stuff.

06:47:11.360 --> 06:47:13.360
Honestly, black flag will take through.

06:47:19.360 --> 06:47:21.360
Going reverse is so slow.

06:47:21.360 --> 06:47:23.360
Can you go backwards?

06:47:23.360 --> 06:47:25.360
I don't even know if you can.

06:47:25.360 --> 06:47:27.360
I'll try. We're just in the old spin around.

06:47:27.360 --> 06:47:29.360
Did that hit?

06:47:29.360 --> 06:47:31.360
I hope so.

06:47:33.360 --> 06:47:35.360
Almost.

06:47:35.360 --> 06:47:37.360
There we go. Beautiful, beautiful.

06:47:37.360 --> 06:47:39.360
And last but not least,

06:47:39.360 --> 06:47:41.360
let's not get too close now.

06:47:41.360 --> 06:47:43.360
Let's not get too close.

06:47:43.360 --> 06:47:45.360
We've still got some momentum.

06:47:49.360 --> 06:47:51.360
One more roll should do it.

06:47:51.360 --> 06:47:53.360
Get us front row seats to this pirate ship going down.

06:47:57.360 --> 06:47:59.360
Oh.

06:47:59.360 --> 06:48:01.360
Ow, ow, ow. They're hurting me.

06:48:01.360 --> 06:48:03.360
They're hurting me.

06:48:05.360 --> 06:48:07.360
Just out of range. Hold on.

06:48:09.360 --> 06:48:11.360
I'm like just there and no more.

06:48:11.360 --> 06:48:13.360
Ow, you guys are hurting me.

06:48:13.360 --> 06:48:15.360
You're giving me a booboo.

06:48:19.360 --> 06:48:21.360
Just out of range.

06:48:21.360 --> 06:48:23.360
That was so close.

06:48:23.360 --> 06:48:25.360
A little bit of a push.

06:48:25.360 --> 06:48:27.360
Get too close to the point where I can't even fucking aim.

06:48:29.360 --> 06:48:31.360
There we go.

06:48:31.360 --> 06:48:33.360
We got it.

06:48:33.360 --> 06:48:35.360
It literally is your tank in all the arrows.

06:48:35.360 --> 06:48:37.360
That was kind of comedic

06:48:37.360 --> 06:48:39.360
the way they jumped off the ship.

06:48:43.360 --> 06:48:45.360
How are they not lunch on you?

06:48:45.360 --> 06:48:47.360
Honestly, there's literally cannonballs.

06:48:49.360 --> 06:48:51.360
Literally BRB.

06:48:51.360 --> 06:48:53.360
Sorry, I can't aim at your shields. Let me just do a little spin around.

06:48:53.360 --> 06:48:55.360
Ooh.

06:48:55.360 --> 06:48:57.360
Oh, we're shooting at itself.

06:49:01.360 --> 06:49:03.360
Wow.

06:49:09.360 --> 06:49:11.360
Splish splash.

06:49:11.360 --> 06:49:13.360
I was ticking fast.

06:49:13.360 --> 06:49:15.360
Oh, we actually got 100% sync for that.

06:49:15.360 --> 06:49:17.360
Okay, I'll take it.

06:49:19.360 --> 06:49:21.360
I used to love this game.

06:49:21.360 --> 06:49:23.360
It has a fantastic taste.

06:49:23.360 --> 06:49:25.360
This is my number one game of all time.

06:49:25.360 --> 06:49:27.360
And I suck at it.

06:49:31.360 --> 06:49:33.360
Is there one more Leonardo mission?

06:49:33.360 --> 06:49:35.360
Yes.

06:49:39.360 --> 06:49:41.360
How are they always on the opposite place?

06:49:47.360 --> 06:49:49.360
There's one.

06:49:49.360 --> 06:49:51.360
This is Leonardo.

06:49:51.360 --> 06:49:53.360
And then we'll get the Guilds Faction Femme.

06:49:57.360 --> 06:49:59.360
Tank tank tank.

06:49:59.360 --> 06:50:01.360
You are good at sucking.

06:50:13.360 --> 06:50:15.360
Sorry, I'm making an animated shot

06:50:15.360 --> 06:50:17.360
of your reference sheet for the meme tag.

06:50:17.360 --> 06:50:19.360
Should I bring in the tweet?

06:50:23.360 --> 06:50:25.360
I don't know when it comes to

06:50:25.360 --> 06:50:27.360
memification of something.

06:50:27.360 --> 06:50:29.360
You don't have to credit the original artist.

06:50:29.360 --> 06:50:31.360
I don't know. What do you guys think?

06:50:31.360 --> 06:50:33.360
You're probably better known than me.

06:50:33.360 --> 06:50:35.360
I did credit her right under the

06:50:35.360 --> 06:50:37.360
thingy so people know

06:50:37.360 --> 06:50:39.360
it is by her under the reference sheet

06:50:39.360 --> 06:50:41.360
at all times.

06:50:41.360 --> 06:50:43.360
I don't know.

06:50:43.360 --> 06:50:45.360
These hay bales

06:50:45.360 --> 06:50:47.360
were so confusing actually.

06:50:49.360 --> 06:50:51.360
One of the games I love the most

06:50:51.360 --> 06:50:53.360
is called Dynasty Warriors.

06:50:53.360 --> 06:50:55.360
AC Brotherhood was the last game I

06:50:55.360 --> 06:50:57.360
truly played in the series.

06:50:57.360 --> 06:50:59.360
Yeah, Revelations was alright.

06:50:59.360 --> 06:51:01.360
But

06:51:01.360 --> 06:51:03.360
it wasn't Brotherhood.

06:51:07.360 --> 06:51:09.360
If I had to rank them as Brotherhood

06:51:09.360 --> 06:51:11.360
then AC2 and then Revelations for

06:51:11.360 --> 06:51:13.360
Exo's storyline.

06:51:13.360 --> 06:51:15.360
I went on an adventure trying to beat

06:51:15.360 --> 06:51:17.360
all of this

06:51:17.360 --> 06:51:19.360
but I stopped at Syndicate.

06:51:21.360 --> 06:51:23.360
I think I've played Assassin's Creed 3

06:51:23.360 --> 06:51:25.360
maybe unironically three times.

06:51:27.360 --> 06:51:29.360
It's just no fun.

06:51:33.360 --> 06:51:35.360
ACR had

06:51:35.360 --> 06:51:37.360
a fucking turret defense.

06:51:37.360 --> 06:51:39.360
Literally the turret defense.

06:51:39.360 --> 06:51:41.360
Do slash credit.

06:51:41.360 --> 06:51:43.360
Yeah, maybe do slash credit just so it's

06:51:43.360 --> 06:51:44.360
not like

06:51:44.360 --> 06:51:45.360
bothering.

06:51:45.360 --> 06:51:47.360
But the credit is there for people who do

06:51:47.360 --> 06:51:49.360
want to use it.

06:51:49.360 --> 06:51:51.360
Yeah, people say they love Black Flag.

06:51:51.360 --> 06:51:53.360
I struggled so much to get into it.

06:51:53.360 --> 06:51:55.360
But I'm wondering if it's just because I'm a

06:51:55.360 --> 06:51:57.360
little crybaby because AC wasn't

06:51:57.360 --> 06:51:59.360
in the series anymore.

06:51:59.360 --> 06:52:01.360
Which is very plausible.

06:52:01.360 --> 06:52:03.360
I wouldn't mind to try and get

06:52:03.360 --> 06:52:05.360
Black Flag. One more big hood.

06:52:05.360 --> 06:52:07.360
Yeah.

06:52:09.360 --> 06:52:11.360
But I just

06:52:11.360 --> 06:52:13.360
really seem to struggle with the controls

06:52:13.360 --> 06:52:15.360
but it's probably because I'm doing

06:52:15.360 --> 06:52:17.360
the, well I've already played Assassin's Creed

06:52:17.360 --> 06:52:19.360
so I don't need to sit and read the controls

06:52:19.360 --> 06:52:21.360
well obviously they have changed the controls.

06:52:23.360 --> 06:52:25.360
I'm

06:52:25.360 --> 06:52:27.360
you're being a crybaby.

06:52:31.360 --> 06:52:33.360
I wish they would make

06:52:33.360 --> 06:52:35.360
more like story multiplayer games.

06:52:35.360 --> 06:52:37.360
Like

06:52:37.360 --> 06:52:39.360
it takes to

06:52:39.360 --> 06:52:41.360
is like such a good story

06:52:41.360 --> 06:52:43.360
thing and I would absolutely love to

06:52:43.360 --> 06:52:45.360
play games like that on stream and be like

06:52:45.360 --> 06:52:47.360
okay after the first chapter we'll get

06:52:47.360 --> 06:52:49.360
someone else in, okay next chapter we'll

06:52:49.360 --> 06:52:51.360
get someone else in but like they just

06:52:51.360 --> 06:52:53.360
didn't do that. They just didn't do that.

06:52:55.360 --> 06:52:57.360
It's so annoying.

06:52:57.360 --> 06:52:59.360
It's so frustrating.

06:52:59.360 --> 06:53:01.360
I can't believe I can't play video games

06:53:01.360 --> 06:53:03.360
exactly the way I want to

06:53:03.360 --> 06:53:05.360
play them.

06:53:05.360 --> 06:53:07.360
It's such a baby.

06:53:11.360 --> 06:53:13.360
Kill the Templar overseer to recover map.

06:53:13.360 --> 06:53:15.360
Use the pistol.

06:53:17.360 --> 06:53:19.360
I can do that.

06:53:31.360 --> 06:53:33.360
No.

06:53:33.360 --> 06:53:35.360
Yes. No.

06:53:35.360 --> 06:53:37.360
Yes.

06:53:41.360 --> 06:53:43.360
Yeah I was going to say you sure you want to

06:53:43.360 --> 06:53:45.360
fight this. Oh wow

06:53:45.360 --> 06:53:47.360
it's always you guys that want to fight.

06:53:47.360 --> 06:53:49.360
Stop this.

06:53:49.360 --> 06:53:51.360
Fuck it Sam.

06:53:51.360 --> 06:53:53.360
Not really.

06:53:53.360 --> 06:53:55.360
I'll see if I can loot a smoke bomb back.

06:53:57.360 --> 06:53:59.360
I've been having a blast

06:53:59.360 --> 06:54:01.360
watching a veteran on a newcomer play the

06:54:01.360 --> 06:54:03.360
Halo.

06:54:03.360 --> 06:54:05.360
Oh yeah the Halo campaign

06:54:05.360 --> 06:54:07.360
is going to be playable.

06:54:15.360 --> 06:54:17.360
Where am I supposed to go?

06:54:17.360 --> 06:54:19.360
Okay last one question mark I think.

06:54:19.360 --> 06:54:21.360
Is it like

06:54:21.360 --> 06:54:23.360
safe to do

06:54:23.360 --> 06:54:25.360
a Halo campaign?

06:54:25.360 --> 06:54:27.360
That would be really cool to do a

06:54:27.360 --> 06:54:29.360
refling. It's not going to lie.

06:54:29.360 --> 06:54:31.360
I'd be pretty hyped for that.

06:54:31.360 --> 06:54:33.360
But I don't know how safe it is to like add

06:54:33.360 --> 06:54:35.360
people.

06:54:35.360 --> 06:54:37.360
Because I don't think I can just instance and

06:54:37.360 --> 06:54:39.360
have you guys in.

06:54:39.360 --> 06:54:41.360
It would be pretty cool to like

06:54:41.360 --> 06:54:47.360
I don't, is it

06:54:47.360 --> 06:54:49.360
duo only or is it four man?

06:54:53.360 --> 06:54:55.360
Favorite game combat of

06:54:55.360 --> 06:54:57.360
is it evolved or

06:54:57.360 --> 06:54:59.360
evolution?

06:55:01.360 --> 06:55:03.360
Oh my gosh

06:55:03.360 --> 06:55:05.360
it's John Halo from Fortnight.

06:55:05.360 --> 06:55:07.360
Laying out his tank

06:55:07.360 --> 06:55:09.360
is an ambitious and devastating war machine

06:55:09.360 --> 06:55:11.360
capable. Do not take any damage while in

06:55:11.360 --> 06:55:13.360
the tank. Yeah good luck for that.

06:55:13.360 --> 06:55:15.360
We're not doing this one.

06:55:15.360 --> 06:55:17.360
But you know

06:55:25.360 --> 06:55:27.360
I have name poison

06:55:27.360 --> 06:55:29.360
which is decent.

06:55:39.360 --> 06:55:41.360
Is he going to come see me?

06:55:41.360 --> 06:55:43.360
Oops.

06:55:43.360 --> 06:55:45.360
Yeah we're not doing that.

06:55:45.360 --> 06:55:47.360
Literally everyone's getting poisoned.

06:55:47.360 --> 06:55:49.360
I don't care.

06:55:51.360 --> 06:55:53.360
I only have name to watch.

06:55:53.360 --> 06:55:55.360
I should have bought some more at a healer.

06:55:59.360 --> 06:56:01.360
Yeah maybe if

06:56:01.360 --> 06:56:03.360
it's safe to add people like on Halo

06:56:03.360 --> 06:56:05.360
then we could do

06:56:05.360 --> 06:56:07.360
playthroughs of that but

06:56:07.360 --> 06:56:09.360
I guess you

06:56:09.360 --> 06:56:11.360
do it mission by mission so like we would do one

06:56:11.360 --> 06:56:13.360
mission and then

06:56:13.360 --> 06:56:15.360
kick out and then add

06:56:15.360 --> 06:56:17.360
and then next mission kick out

06:56:17.360 --> 06:56:19.360
you know.

06:56:21.360 --> 06:56:23.360
You see nothing.

06:56:27.360 --> 06:56:29.360
How did you guys not shoot?

06:56:29.360 --> 06:56:31.360
It's a poison dart so it's supposed to

06:56:31.360 --> 06:56:33.360
just be like a little swing

06:56:33.360 --> 06:56:35.360
and no one knows.

06:56:35.360 --> 06:56:37.360
Literally poison is so OP for like when it

06:56:37.360 --> 06:56:39.360
comes to don't be detected because you can walk

06:56:39.360 --> 06:56:41.360
right in front of them and

06:56:41.360 --> 06:56:43.360
obviously the crossbow does the exact same thing

06:56:43.360 --> 06:56:45.360
but I don't know how to say it.

06:56:45.360 --> 06:56:47.360
Poison's cool.

06:56:47.360 --> 06:56:49.360
Oops sorry.

06:56:49.360 --> 06:56:51.360
I was pulling down my sleeves

06:56:51.360 --> 06:56:53.360
I'm getting a...

06:56:53.360 --> 06:56:55.360
That's right I'm wearing a hoodie.

06:56:55.360 --> 06:56:57.360
You'll never guess why.

06:56:57.360 --> 06:56:59.360
Wait how am I supposed to see him?

06:57:07.360 --> 06:57:09.360
I love how as soon as you go sideways

06:57:09.360 --> 06:57:11.360
they just don't care anymore.

06:57:19.360 --> 06:57:21.360
Beat up the architect.

06:57:21.360 --> 06:57:23.360
Oh okay.

06:57:25.360 --> 06:57:27.360
Hello.

06:57:35.360 --> 06:57:37.360
You're so aggressive.

06:57:37.360 --> 06:57:39.360
You just ask before beating up.

06:57:49.360 --> 06:57:51.360
We're helping people.

06:57:53.360 --> 06:57:55.360
Go home.

06:57:57.360 --> 06:57:59.360
Checkpoint reached.

06:57:59.360 --> 06:58:01.360
Amalo to be seen yet?

06:58:03.360 --> 06:58:05.360
No.

06:58:07.360 --> 06:58:09.360
This music is so dramatic.

06:58:09.360 --> 06:58:11.360
Checking my heart for that.

06:58:11.360 --> 06:58:13.360
You can go first.

06:58:13.360 --> 06:58:15.360
Sucks to suck.

06:58:15.360 --> 06:58:17.360
Sorry but if someone had to bear.

06:58:19.360 --> 06:58:21.360
We could do two poisons here

06:58:21.360 --> 06:58:23.360
just to be doubly sure.

06:58:27.360 --> 06:58:29.360
We could probably do...

06:58:29.360 --> 06:58:31.360
Can you? No I really...

06:58:31.360 --> 06:58:33.360
Oh my god that alerted him?

06:58:33.360 --> 06:58:35.360
No.

06:58:35.360 --> 06:58:37.360
I need this guy to par...

06:58:37.360 --> 06:58:39.360
Stop hurting!

06:58:39.360 --> 06:58:41.360
And then in order to unsheathe my...

06:58:45.360 --> 06:58:47.360
Right you're next.

06:58:47.360 --> 06:58:49.360
You're freaking next.

06:58:49.360 --> 06:58:51.360
Now that I can see you.

06:58:51.360 --> 06:58:53.360
Jeez you're such a pain in my butt.

06:58:53.360 --> 06:58:55.360
Not the good kind.

06:58:55.360 --> 06:58:57.360
You're next.

06:58:57.360 --> 06:58:59.360
You're all done.

06:58:59.360 --> 06:59:01.360
And everyone's perished.

06:59:01.360 --> 06:59:03.360
And my ankles are sore.

06:59:03.360 --> 06:59:05.360
But it's fine.

06:59:05.360 --> 06:59:07.360
We did it.

06:59:07.360 --> 06:59:09.360
First thing I checked

06:59:09.360 --> 06:59:11.360
was she still screaming for me.

06:59:11.360 --> 06:59:13.360
No.

06:59:13.360 --> 06:59:15.360
I would have gone the 14 hours

06:59:15.360 --> 06:59:17.360
but it didn't work.

06:59:17.360 --> 06:59:19.360
Free the mercenaries.

06:59:19.360 --> 06:59:21.360
Can I still be...

06:59:21.360 --> 06:59:23.360
Can't be spoilers?

06:59:27.360 --> 06:59:29.360
So I don't even hear?

06:59:29.360 --> 06:59:31.360
Doesn't look like it.

06:59:31.360 --> 06:59:33.360
Hi mercenaries!

06:59:33.360 --> 06:59:35.360
Where is Dabinchi's machine?

06:59:35.360 --> 06:59:37.360
Follow us. They have hidden the path

06:59:37.360 --> 06:59:39.360
but we discovered the entrance.

06:59:39.360 --> 06:59:41.360
There you come lads.

06:59:43.360 --> 06:59:45.360
Three mercenaries?

06:59:45.360 --> 06:59:47.360
Oh not two.

06:59:47.360 --> 06:59:49.360
Follow and protect them.

06:59:49.360 --> 06:59:51.360
Well maybe if they didn't

06:59:51.360 --> 06:59:53.360
jump right in front of the enemies.

06:59:53.360 --> 06:59:55.360
Then sure.

06:59:55.360 --> 06:59:57.360
Wait wait wait you're done.

06:59:57.360 --> 06:59:59.360
I'm farting.

06:59:59.360 --> 07:00:01.360
You're done.

07:00:01.360 --> 07:00:03.360
Oh it's good to see me.

07:00:05.360 --> 07:00:07.360
Hopefully they can actually fight a weaver.

07:00:07.360 --> 07:00:09.360
No! Why are you fighting one of them?

07:00:09.360 --> 07:00:11.360
Why is there...

07:00:11.360 --> 07:00:13.360
Please stab them in the...

07:00:13.360 --> 07:00:15.360
Oh and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

07:00:15.360 --> 07:00:17.360
Stop it.

07:00:17.360 --> 07:00:19.360
Stop it.

07:00:25.360 --> 07:00:27.360
I hate when they do that right.

07:00:27.360 --> 07:00:29.360
Where are you taking me?

07:00:33.360 --> 07:00:35.360
Step eight Rizzo.

07:00:35.360 --> 07:00:37.360
Fart in the guards faces.

07:00:37.360 --> 07:00:39.360
Get him first!

07:00:39.360 --> 07:00:41.360
Get him first! No you missed him!

07:00:41.360 --> 07:00:43.360
You were supposed to get the other guards.

07:00:43.360 --> 07:00:45.360
Right right we're farting again.

07:00:45.360 --> 07:00:47.360
There we go.

07:00:53.360 --> 07:00:55.360
I should have got that guy first actually.

07:00:55.360 --> 07:00:57.360
Oh and he's right around the corner.

07:00:57.360 --> 07:00:59.360
I'm just attracted to the tent.

07:00:59.360 --> 07:01:01.360
Please just perish your one HP

07:01:01.360 --> 07:01:03.360
in a freaking dream!

07:01:03.360 --> 07:01:05.360
And it's not even registering

07:01:05.360 --> 07:01:07.360
my kicks probably.

07:01:07.360 --> 07:01:09.360
And that guy's getting beaten up by a brute.

07:01:09.360 --> 07:01:11.360
Yeah they're done.

07:01:11.360 --> 07:01:13.360
Can I loot in time for another

07:01:13.360 --> 07:01:15.360
fart bomb because

07:01:15.360 --> 07:01:17.360
we're needing them.

07:01:17.360 --> 07:01:19.360
I got one. Okay I actually got one needed.

07:01:31.360 --> 07:01:33.360
Let's go for it.

07:01:33.360 --> 07:01:35.360
What's that?

07:01:37.360 --> 07:01:39.360
Open inside?

07:01:43.360 --> 07:01:45.360
Hold still.

07:01:45.360 --> 07:01:47.360
Wait for me.

07:01:47.360 --> 07:01:49.360
A little bit parkour.

07:01:49.360 --> 07:01:51.360
A little bit parkour momentum.

07:01:57.360 --> 07:01:59.360
Okay there we go.

07:01:59.360 --> 07:02:01.360
Open for you.

07:02:01.360 --> 07:02:03.360
Open sesame.

07:02:09.360 --> 07:02:11.360
Did I just say open sesame?

07:02:13.360 --> 07:02:15.360
No.

07:02:17.360 --> 07:02:19.360
Remember that time

07:02:19.360 --> 07:02:21.360
I got asked about open sesame?

07:02:23.360 --> 07:02:25.360
And I said open cumin.

07:02:25.360 --> 07:02:27.360
Good times.

07:02:27.360 --> 07:02:29.360
I'm such an idiot.

07:02:31.360 --> 07:02:33.360
I don't know if anyone remembers.

07:02:35.360 --> 07:02:37.360
Saved!

07:02:37.360 --> 07:02:39.360
Jeez it's you.

07:02:39.360 --> 07:02:41.360
I did not think I would get here.

07:02:45.360 --> 07:02:47.360
I don't know why my brain blank.

07:02:49.360 --> 07:02:51.360
I think it was the way the question was worded.

07:02:51.360 --> 07:02:53.360
I will lower the bridge.

07:02:53.360 --> 07:02:55.360
Can I lower the bridge?

07:02:55.360 --> 07:02:57.360
I guess I can.

07:03:01.360 --> 07:03:03.360
Open sesame!

07:03:03.360 --> 07:03:05.360
Or open cumin.

07:03:05.360 --> 07:03:07.360
I don't know which one seems better than me.

07:03:09.360 --> 07:03:11.360
I don't know.

07:03:17.360 --> 07:03:19.360
Is there a lever?

07:03:19.360 --> 07:03:21.360
I don't think so.

07:03:25.360 --> 07:03:27.360
The way you recalled that.

07:03:27.360 --> 07:03:29.360
Literally my brain was like

07:03:29.360 --> 07:03:31.360
recalling memory loading.

07:03:31.360 --> 07:03:33.360
Memory loaded.

07:03:33.360 --> 07:03:35.360
It's open cinnamon.

07:03:43.360 --> 07:03:45.360
Music?

07:03:49.360 --> 07:03:51.360
Oh my god.

07:03:51.360 --> 07:03:53.360
Hello?

07:03:55.360 --> 07:03:57.360
Can I run people?

07:03:57.360 --> 07:03:59.360
I must be able to run people over.

07:03:59.360 --> 07:04:01.360
There's no way in heck.

07:04:01.360 --> 07:04:03.360
Oh my god.

07:04:03.360 --> 07:04:05.360
This is adorable.

07:04:05.360 --> 07:04:07.360
Yeah, POV come.

07:04:07.360 --> 07:04:09.360
Take that.

07:04:13.360 --> 07:04:15.360
This is so cool.

07:04:15.360 --> 07:04:17.360
I love this POV.

07:04:17.360 --> 07:04:19.360
Maybe not.

07:04:21.360 --> 07:04:23.360
I don't know what's behind it.

07:04:23.360 --> 07:04:25.360
I assume that's what hurts me.

07:04:25.360 --> 07:04:27.360
If I take damage.

07:04:27.360 --> 07:04:29.360
I don't know.

07:04:29.360 --> 07:04:31.360
100% a bunch.

07:04:31.360 --> 07:04:33.360
That's unlucky.

07:04:33.360 --> 07:04:35.360
Oh well.

07:04:35.360 --> 07:04:37.360
Sorry, that's a lot easier to tell

07:04:37.360 --> 07:04:39.360
what's coming up.

07:04:39.360 --> 07:04:41.360
I'm sorry, I have to change camera angle.

07:04:41.360 --> 07:04:43.360
I apologize.

07:04:45.360 --> 07:04:47.360
After the 100%.

07:04:47.360 --> 07:04:49.360
Are you squidding me right now?

07:04:49.360 --> 07:04:51.360
Thank you for the tip.

07:04:51.360 --> 07:04:53.360
What did you see?

07:04:55.360 --> 07:04:57.360
Hold on.

07:04:57.360 --> 07:04:59.360
I'm destroying things.

07:04:59.360 --> 07:05:01.360
Wait, wait.

07:05:01.360 --> 07:05:03.360
Thank you for the tip.

07:05:03.360 --> 07:05:05.360
Why are you?

07:05:05.360 --> 07:05:07.360
There's no way someone is standing up to a tank.

07:05:07.360 --> 07:05:09.360
You have to be crazy to stand up to a tank.

07:05:11.360 --> 07:05:13.360
Did they even do damage?

07:05:21.360 --> 07:05:23.360
Oh, so you can dodge.

07:05:23.360 --> 07:05:25.360
Let me pause.

07:05:25.360 --> 07:05:27.360
I don't want to miss that.

07:05:27.360 --> 07:05:29.360
I'm really dumb.

07:05:29.360 --> 07:05:31.360
I'm going to forget.

07:05:31.360 --> 07:05:33.360
I don't want to forgo.

07:05:33.360 --> 07:05:35.360
No way.

07:05:35.360 --> 07:05:37.360
Okay.

07:05:37.360 --> 07:05:39.360
Hey Australia.

07:05:39.360 --> 07:05:41.360
I'm back from work.

07:05:41.360 --> 07:05:43.360
Yeah, I got tank tank.

07:05:43.360 --> 07:05:45.360
Thank you for the tip.

07:05:45.360 --> 07:05:47.360
I appreciate it.

07:05:47.360 --> 07:05:49.360
Oh.

07:05:49.360 --> 07:05:51.360
Man, just tank that whole cannonball.

07:05:53.360 --> 07:05:55.360
I need help setting up alerts.

07:05:55.360 --> 07:05:57.360
They barely work.

07:05:57.360 --> 07:05:59.360
It's a bit of a nightmare to instrument elements,

07:05:59.360 --> 07:06:01.360
but once you get it set up,

07:06:01.360 --> 07:06:03.360
you never have to change it again.

07:06:03.360 --> 07:06:05.360
And you can set up custom

07:06:05.360 --> 07:06:07.360
things like if someone

07:06:07.360 --> 07:06:09.360
donated like $69,

07:06:09.360 --> 07:06:11.360
for example, you can get it to do.

07:06:11.360 --> 07:06:13.360
Are we going in a battle dome?

07:06:13.360 --> 07:06:15.360
Yes!

07:06:15.360 --> 07:06:17.360
Yes!

07:06:17.360 --> 07:06:19.360
Oh my god, tank battle dome!

07:06:19.360 --> 07:06:21.360
Take this.

07:06:21.360 --> 07:06:23.360
And this.

07:06:23.360 --> 07:06:25.360
Hold on, I'm reloading.

07:06:25.360 --> 07:06:27.360
And this.

07:06:27.360 --> 07:06:29.360
Yes!

07:06:29.360 --> 07:06:31.360
Oh my god, I love tank battle dome.

07:06:31.360 --> 07:06:33.360
This is amazing.

07:06:39.360 --> 07:06:41.360
More tank battle dome.

07:06:41.360 --> 07:06:43.360
More tank battle dome.

07:06:43.360 --> 07:06:45.360
There's something.

07:06:45.360 --> 07:06:47.360
Let me in.

07:06:47.360 --> 07:06:49.360
Let me in.

07:06:49.360 --> 07:06:51.360
This is why I think of your factories.

07:06:51.360 --> 07:06:53.360
Take this, capitalism.

07:06:55.360 --> 07:06:57.360
Tanks! Tank battle dome!

07:06:57.360 --> 07:06:59.360
No, no, you're not loading the tank.

07:06:59.360 --> 07:07:01.360
You're not loading it.

07:07:01.360 --> 07:07:03.360
Tank battle dome.

07:07:03.360 --> 07:07:05.360
Tank battle dome.

07:07:05.360 --> 07:07:07.360
I'm stuck on the cylinder box.

07:07:07.360 --> 07:07:09.360
Tank battle dome.

07:07:09.360 --> 07:07:11.360
Tank battle dome.

07:07:13.360 --> 07:07:15.360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:07:15.360 --> 07:07:17.360
Wait, wait, wait. Let me in, let me in, let me in, let me in.

07:07:17.360 --> 07:07:19.360
Let me in.

07:07:19.360 --> 07:07:21.360
Okay, there we go.

07:07:21.360 --> 07:07:23.360
Tank battle dome.

07:07:23.360 --> 07:07:25.360
Battle dome, battle dome, battle dome, battle dome, battle dome.

07:07:39.360 --> 07:07:41.360
Yeah, I don't know how I'm going to

07:07:41.360 --> 07:07:43.360
think that. I'm not going to lie.

07:07:43.360 --> 07:07:45.360
I ain't going, there's no way I'm 100%.

07:07:45.360 --> 07:07:47.360
We can try and layer

07:07:47.360 --> 07:07:49.360
streams, but

07:07:49.360 --> 07:07:51.360
yeah, there's no shot. I'm doing it tonight.

07:07:51.360 --> 07:07:53.360
Arrivederci.

07:07:53.360 --> 07:07:55.360
Little tank.

07:07:55.360 --> 07:07:57.360
No, I wish I could keep you.

07:07:57.360 --> 07:07:59.360
I see we're so real for that.

07:07:59.360 --> 07:08:01.360
That was fun.

07:08:01.360 --> 07:08:03.360
I like tank battle dome.

07:08:03.360 --> 07:08:05.360
Just don't take damage.

07:08:05.360 --> 07:08:07.360
Five hits, honestly.

07:08:07.360 --> 07:08:09.360
Someone was like, have you ever played the game modded before?

07:08:09.360 --> 07:08:11.360
Me who mods it so I can't take damage

07:08:11.360 --> 07:08:13.360
so I can do the no damage hits.

07:08:13.360 --> 07:08:15.360
Runs.

07:08:15.360 --> 07:08:17.360
Some of the

07:08:17.360 --> 07:08:19.360
freaking 100%

07:08:19.360 --> 07:08:21.360
are a bit outrageous, honestly.

07:08:25.360 --> 07:08:27.360
Rest builders who have to go, if you need

07:08:27.360 --> 07:08:29.360
to go sleepy, bye bye.

07:08:29.360 --> 07:08:31.360
Strongly, I'm up for almost 36 hours.

07:08:31.360 --> 07:08:33.360
I'm going to get some shy.

07:08:33.360 --> 07:08:35.360
Oh my God, that's dangerous. Definitely get some rest.

07:08:35.360 --> 07:08:37.360
My goodness.

07:08:37.360 --> 07:08:39.360
Yes, we will have a wonderful stream.

07:08:47.360 --> 07:08:49.360
It's dirty underwear.

07:08:57.360 --> 07:08:59.360
Okay.

07:08:59.360 --> 07:09:01.360
I think I know what we do with that.

07:09:03.360 --> 07:09:05.360
I think I know

07:09:05.360 --> 07:09:07.360
what we do with it.

07:09:13.360 --> 07:09:15.360
99% sure I know what we do with it.

07:09:17.360 --> 07:09:19.360
Y'all don't mind

07:09:19.360 --> 07:09:21.360
what we go do right now.

07:09:25.360 --> 07:09:27.360
That was Leonardo da Vinci, you're right.

07:09:27.360 --> 07:09:29.360
You're not wrong.

07:09:29.360 --> 07:09:31.360
Maybe I could have gone off that surface.

07:09:35.360 --> 07:09:37.360
I think it's just one of the guild

07:09:37.360 --> 07:09:39.360
requirements

07:09:39.360 --> 07:09:41.360
to use

07:09:41.360 --> 07:09:43.360
the parachute.

07:09:43.360 --> 07:09:45.360
Oh, there's a bank actually.

07:09:45.360 --> 07:09:47.360
I'm going to take my bank money out because

07:09:47.360 --> 07:09:49.360
it looks cool.

07:09:51.360 --> 07:09:53.360
I can faint the bank.

07:09:53.360 --> 07:09:55.360
Good evening.

07:09:55.360 --> 07:09:57.360
Good afternoon, Mr.

07:09:57.360 --> 07:09:59.360
Bankman.

07:09:59.360 --> 07:10:01.360
Can I have my landlord simulant?

07:10:01.360 --> 07:10:03.360
Whoa, where the heck is this thing?

07:10:03.360 --> 07:10:05.360
Can I have the landlord simulator

07:10:05.360 --> 07:10:07.360
part of this game?

07:10:09.360 --> 07:10:11.360
Is he counting coins?

07:10:11.360 --> 07:10:13.360
Why is he leaning over like that?

07:10:13.360 --> 07:10:15.360
He looks so insidious, like, ball him.

07:10:15.360 --> 07:10:17.360
My coins.

07:10:21.360 --> 07:10:23.360
12 never came, so me and the SUV

07:10:23.360 --> 07:10:25.360
just went away. Lol.

07:10:29.360 --> 07:10:31.360
Hello bank, I was like

07:10:31.360 --> 07:10:33.360
I want one zillion dollars.

07:10:35.360 --> 07:10:37.360
We're rich, we're rich.

07:10:39.360 --> 07:10:41.360
Right, next

07:10:41.360 --> 07:10:43.360
we're going to do challenges

07:10:43.360 --> 07:10:45.360
to get

07:10:45.360 --> 07:10:47.360
our guild

07:10:47.360 --> 07:10:49.360
to play decoration,

07:10:49.360 --> 07:10:51.360
to play room decoration.

07:10:51.360 --> 07:10:53.360
So we've done landlord simulator, we're now doing room

07:10:53.360 --> 07:10:55.360
decoration.

07:10:55.360 --> 07:10:57.360
Uh,

07:10:57.360 --> 07:10:59.360
and then

07:10:59.360 --> 07:11:01.360
after that

07:11:01.360 --> 07:11:03.360
I

07:11:03.360 --> 07:11:05.360
think we actually have

07:11:05.360 --> 07:11:07.360
done, like, the main

07:11:07.360 --> 07:11:09.360
we're going to take some of the layouts

07:11:09.360 --> 07:11:11.360
of this place.

07:11:11.360 --> 07:11:13.360
He actually just gave you

07:11:13.360 --> 07:11:15.360
sheets to take. It's his laundry.

07:11:15.360 --> 07:11:17.360
He's like, here it is, it's all for you

07:11:17.360 --> 07:11:19.360
buddy.

07:11:19.360 --> 07:11:21.360
And why not jump with me?

07:11:21.360 --> 07:11:23.360
That's such a smart, I wonder

07:11:23.360 --> 07:11:25.360
he only says that line

07:11:25.360 --> 07:11:27.360
if you jump here.

07:11:29.360 --> 07:11:31.360
Butcher. It's not a butcher.

07:11:31.360 --> 07:11:33.360
Why do you keep saying butcher?

07:11:33.360 --> 07:11:35.360
I don't know.

07:11:35.360 --> 07:11:37.360
They both begin with the letter B

07:11:37.360 --> 07:11:39.360
so

07:11:39.360 --> 07:11:41.360
yeah, maybe that's why

07:11:41.360 --> 07:11:43.360
instead of blacksmiths I say butcher.

07:11:47.360 --> 07:11:49.360
Up next, animal crossing

07:11:49.360 --> 07:11:51.360
decorating rooms.

07:11:51.360 --> 07:11:53.360
I

07:11:53.360 --> 07:11:55.360
personally will never

07:11:55.360 --> 07:11:57.360
stream animal crossing.

07:11:57.360 --> 07:11:59.360
I don't

07:11:59.360 --> 07:12:01.360
know.

07:12:01.360 --> 07:12:03.360
Whoa, they boarded me

07:12:03.360 --> 07:12:05.360
out.

07:12:05.360 --> 07:12:07.360
Oh

07:12:07.360 --> 07:12:09.360
bridge.

07:12:09.360 --> 07:12:11.360
Like I don't know if I can make

07:12:11.360 --> 07:12:13.360
animal crossing fun.

07:12:13.360 --> 07:12:15.360
Like

07:12:15.360 --> 07:12:17.360
maybe as a

07:12:17.360 --> 07:12:19.360
I don't know. I couldn't make it

07:12:19.360 --> 07:12:21.360
fun. I don't mind watching other people play it

07:12:21.360 --> 07:12:23.360
but me, I'm like, I ain't that creative

07:12:23.360 --> 07:12:25.360
to make it entertaining.

07:12:25.360 --> 07:12:27.360
I love all the games that

07:12:27.360 --> 07:12:29.360
start with AC on full.

07:12:29.360 --> 07:12:31.360
Right, so I guess the only way to get back

07:12:31.360 --> 07:12:33.360
into the castle is this way from now on.

07:12:33.360 --> 07:12:35.360
Whoa, we have over a hundred

07:12:35.360 --> 07:12:37.360
thousand forums.

07:12:39.360 --> 07:12:41.360
Right, I can

07:12:41.360 --> 07:12:43.360
can I walk through that gate?

07:12:43.360 --> 07:12:45.360
No.

07:12:45.360 --> 07:12:47.360
That would be too easy.

07:12:47.360 --> 07:12:49.360
I wonder, actually, probably post-game

07:12:49.360 --> 07:12:51.360
they should actually open that gate. I said what I said

07:12:51.360 --> 07:12:53.360
because like chaseries won't do a thing.

07:12:55.360 --> 07:12:57.360
Yeah, oh no, guys, I've got a DM.

07:12:57.360 --> 07:12:59.360
I was getting nervous.

07:12:59.360 --> 07:13:01.360
I'm like, oh no, is there something wrong with my babies

07:13:01.360 --> 07:13:03.360
if I've got a DM?

07:13:05.360 --> 07:13:06.360
Everything is

07:13:06.360 --> 07:13:07.360
really cute.

07:13:09.360 --> 07:13:11.360
Oh, we have the thumbnails

07:13:11.360 --> 07:13:13.360
for our first group collab.

07:13:13.360 --> 07:13:15.360
And that is what I knew.

07:13:15.360 --> 07:13:17.360
How interesting.

07:13:17.360 --> 07:13:19.360
I'll let it be a mystery.

07:13:25.360 --> 07:13:27.360
Rest well, those who have to go.

07:13:27.360 --> 07:13:29.360
Thank you for hanging.

07:13:31.360 --> 07:13:33.360
Mercy is going live

07:13:33.360 --> 07:13:35.360
in 2 minus

07:13:35.360 --> 07:13:37.360
1 hour and 45

07:13:37.360 --> 07:13:39.360
for a

07:13:39.360 --> 07:13:41.360
how the heck to get up. I've completely

07:13:41.360 --> 07:13:43.360
forgotten all over again.

07:13:43.360 --> 07:13:45.360
Just go straight up

07:13:45.360 --> 07:13:47.360
like that, I guess.

07:13:47.360 --> 07:13:49.360
I do have my assassins

07:13:49.360 --> 07:13:51.360
so I suppose I can just signal them to go

07:13:51.360 --> 07:13:53.360
get rid of them.

07:13:53.360 --> 07:13:55.360
Yeah.

07:13:57.360 --> 07:13:59.360
Wait, wasn't there?

07:14:01.360 --> 07:14:03.360
This way over here.

07:14:05.360 --> 07:14:07.360
Relax, Hen.

07:14:07.360 --> 07:14:09.360
Why are you moaning

07:14:09.360 --> 07:14:11.360
about the place? My goodness.

07:14:11.360 --> 07:14:13.360
Alert the guards.

07:14:15.360 --> 07:14:16.360
Good night.

07:14:16.360 --> 07:14:18.360
Sleep well, those who need to sleep.

07:14:18.360 --> 07:14:20.360
Good morning, those who are good

07:14:20.360 --> 07:14:22.360
morning.

07:14:26.360 --> 07:14:28.360
She's getting me acting up.

07:14:28.360 --> 07:14:30.360
Oh, literally, I don't know what that was.

07:14:36.360 --> 07:14:38.360
Okay, this is what I was going to do.

07:14:39.360 --> 07:14:41.360
Let's do you.

07:14:41.360 --> 07:14:43.360
No, that guy actually

07:14:43.360 --> 07:14:45.360
can see you here.

07:14:47.360 --> 07:14:49.360
Morning.

07:14:49.360 --> 07:14:51.360
Europe's waking up.

07:14:57.360 --> 07:14:59.360
Okay, the assassin signals being able to

07:14:59.360 --> 07:15:01.360
do that is like amazing.

07:15:10.360 --> 07:15:12.360
It's 3 a.m. in Europe.

07:15:12.360 --> 07:15:14.360
Oh, I'm a bit early for European streamers.

07:15:14.360 --> 07:15:16.360
I apologize.

07:15:18.360 --> 07:15:20.360
Can I not go up there?

07:15:20.360 --> 07:15:22.360
I don't want to go too far.

07:15:22.360 --> 07:15:24.360
Okay, it's the next one I go up.

07:15:25.360 --> 07:15:27.360
I need to go down in order to go up.

07:15:30.360 --> 07:15:33.360
European's perishing right now trying to

07:15:33.360 --> 07:15:35.360
wait.

07:15:35.360 --> 07:15:37.360
I'm losing it.

07:15:39.360 --> 07:15:41.360
Yeah, go down to go up.

07:15:41.360 --> 07:15:43.360
Okay, I'm starting to kind of remember, but...

07:15:44.360 --> 07:15:46.360
It's always 3 a.m. somewhere.

07:15:50.360 --> 07:15:52.360
Last and ESP.

07:15:53.360 --> 07:15:56.360
I have no idea what time zone I'm like

07:15:56.360 --> 07:15:58.360
perfect for.

07:15:58.360 --> 07:16:00.360
But then again,

07:16:00.360 --> 07:16:02.360
am I technically not perfect

07:16:02.360 --> 07:16:05.360
for all time zones if I stream really long?

07:16:10.360 --> 07:16:11.360
Hmm.

07:16:11.360 --> 07:16:14.360
Yeah, I don't think we're doing a 12 hours

07:16:14.360 --> 07:16:16.360
before anyone is strapped in.

07:16:18.360 --> 07:16:20.360
So some people will be relieved to hear

07:16:20.360 --> 07:16:22.360
that we're not doing another 12 hours

07:16:22.360 --> 07:16:24.360
at this floating home.

07:16:24.360 --> 07:16:26.360
I think when we do Eldon Ring,

07:16:26.360 --> 07:16:29.360
it will be a few back-to-back 12 hours.

07:16:31.360 --> 07:16:33.360
Yeah, you fit all time zones.

07:16:33.360 --> 07:16:35.360
Heh heh heh.

07:16:37.360 --> 07:16:39.360
Bad healthy sleep.

07:16:39.360 --> 07:16:42.360
You'd be perfect for New Zealand.

07:16:43.360 --> 07:16:45.360
I thought it was 4 a.m.

07:16:45.360 --> 07:16:47.360
Sorry, I didn't have my weapon out.

07:16:48.360 --> 07:16:50.360
Sorry, I'm not paying attention.

07:16:50.360 --> 07:16:51.360
I'm Jerry Jack.

07:16:51.360 --> 07:16:53.360
Why have you got your...

07:16:53.360 --> 07:16:54.360
Put away this thing?

07:16:54.360 --> 07:16:56.360
Oh, my thing's glitched out.

07:16:56.360 --> 07:16:57.360
It's like...

07:16:57.360 --> 07:16:59.360
What are you doing?

07:16:59.360 --> 07:17:01.360
Oh, that was kind of badass.

07:17:01.360 --> 07:17:03.360
I wouldn't lose it all.

07:17:05.360 --> 07:17:07.360
Something's not...

07:17:07.360 --> 07:17:08.360
I had it up here.

07:17:08.360 --> 07:17:09.360
That was...

07:17:09.360 --> 07:17:10.360
That was...

07:17:10.360 --> 07:17:11.360
Now my...

07:17:11.360 --> 07:17:12.360
Assassin...

07:17:12.360 --> 07:17:14.360
What are you doing, Lady?

07:17:15.360 --> 07:17:16.360
Classic woman moment.

07:17:16.360 --> 07:17:18.360
Can't make up her mind.

07:17:18.360 --> 07:17:19.360
That's terrible.

07:17:19.360 --> 07:17:21.360
Don't make too much of that.

07:17:22.360 --> 07:17:23.360
Don't do that.

07:17:23.360 --> 07:17:24.360
That's my next.

07:17:24.360 --> 07:17:25.360
Heh heh.

07:17:29.360 --> 07:17:31.360
He has two goons.

07:17:40.360 --> 07:17:42.360
We're doing it!

07:17:42.360 --> 07:17:44.360
We're doing the thing!

07:17:47.360 --> 07:17:48.360
Oh.

07:17:48.360 --> 07:17:49.360
That's on the way.

07:17:49.360 --> 07:17:51.360
Oh, it was on the wrong side.

07:17:51.360 --> 07:17:53.360
My Assassin's still having de-spawn.

07:17:53.360 --> 07:17:54.360
They're freaking out.

07:17:54.360 --> 07:17:55.360
I don't like it.

07:17:56.360 --> 07:17:57.360
Right.

07:17:59.360 --> 07:18:01.360
So I don't mess this up.

07:18:01.360 --> 07:18:03.360
How do I tell the parachute to come out?

07:18:09.360 --> 07:18:10.360
Uh...

07:18:10.360 --> 07:18:11.360
I'm being propaganda.

07:18:11.360 --> 07:18:13.360
How do I tell the parachute to come out?

07:18:15.360 --> 07:18:17.360
Did I just launch and press X?

07:18:19.360 --> 07:18:20.360
Right.

07:18:20.360 --> 07:18:21.360
I don't...

07:18:22.360 --> 07:18:23.360
I don't want to go that way

07:18:23.360 --> 07:18:25.360
because that won't activate the jump.

07:18:27.360 --> 07:18:28.360
Look at that thing.

07:18:28.360 --> 07:18:30.360
The Assassins are really struggling.

07:18:31.360 --> 07:18:32.360
Should prompt...

07:18:32.360 --> 07:18:33.360
Do a flip.

07:18:33.360 --> 07:18:34.360
Okay.

07:18:35.360 --> 07:18:36.360
What were we doing?

07:18:36.360 --> 07:18:37.360
Did I go that way?

07:18:37.360 --> 07:18:38.360
Or that way?

07:18:40.360 --> 07:18:42.360
No point in going in the back in the street.

07:18:45.360 --> 07:18:46.360
Uh...

07:18:46.360 --> 07:18:47.360
Whatever the prompt is,

07:18:47.360 --> 07:18:49.360
bloody hope it comes up because...

07:18:50.360 --> 07:18:51.360
it is...

07:18:51.360 --> 07:18:53.360
not on the wheel.

07:18:56.360 --> 07:18:57.360
Oh, there we go.

07:18:57.360 --> 07:18:58.360
Oh, thank God.

07:18:58.360 --> 07:18:59.360
Right.

07:18:59.360 --> 07:19:01.360
I need to do like a ton of distance.

07:19:01.360 --> 07:19:03.360
I guess I'll just go over the wall.

07:19:05.360 --> 07:19:07.360
I was really worried that prompt wasn't going to come out.

07:19:10.360 --> 07:19:13.360
I think I need to glade like 500 meters.

07:19:19.360 --> 07:19:21.360
Uh...

07:19:21.360 --> 07:19:23.360
Am I going to make the glide?

07:19:27.360 --> 07:19:28.360
Am I going to make the glide?

07:19:28.360 --> 07:19:29.360
Hello?

07:19:31.360 --> 07:19:32.360
Am I not going to make it?

07:19:32.360 --> 07:19:33.360
Come on, pop.

07:19:33.360 --> 07:19:34.360
Pop.

07:19:34.360 --> 07:19:35.360
Pop.

07:19:35.360 --> 07:19:36.360
Pop.

07:19:36.360 --> 07:19:38.360
No, I don't want to climb it again.

07:19:38.360 --> 07:19:39.360
Please pop.

07:19:39.360 --> 07:19:40.360
What was that supposed to do?

07:19:44.360 --> 07:19:45.360
Why did that not pop?

07:19:45.360 --> 07:19:46.360
I was supposed...

07:19:46.360 --> 07:19:47.360
something was supposed to pop there.

07:19:47.360 --> 07:19:48.360
Not the achievement.

07:19:50.360 --> 07:19:52.360
What was supposed to...

07:19:52.360 --> 07:19:54.360
what did I do wrong?

07:19:55.360 --> 07:19:57.360
It was an assassin's.

07:19:59.360 --> 07:20:01.360
Was it thieves because they're agile?

07:20:03.360 --> 07:20:04.360
Glade...

07:20:04.360 --> 07:20:07.360
and a cumulative total of 500 meters were a part of it.

07:20:07.360 --> 07:20:08.360
Is that what I just said?

07:20:14.360 --> 07:20:16.360
I'm not to turn at all.

07:20:17.360 --> 07:20:18.360
Okay.

07:20:19.360 --> 07:20:20.360
No.

07:20:21.360 --> 07:20:24.360
I hope you guys have the same patience for me.

07:20:24.360 --> 07:20:26.360
Because I need to do that all over again.

07:20:26.360 --> 07:20:27.360
I don't know...

07:20:28.360 --> 07:20:29.360
cumulative.

07:20:30.360 --> 07:20:31.360
Alright.

07:20:31.360 --> 07:20:33.360
I'll just do it again because it should pop then.

07:20:34.360 --> 07:20:35.360
Just do it multiple times.

07:20:35.360 --> 07:20:36.360
Yes.

07:20:36.360 --> 07:20:38.360
Alright, we're going to zoom it because at least I know exactly where to go.

07:20:40.360 --> 07:20:41.360
Wait.

07:20:41.360 --> 07:20:42.360
Wait.

07:20:44.360 --> 07:20:46.360
You can do it cheeky sometimes.

07:20:47.360 --> 07:20:49.360
I thought you could do it in one jump.

07:20:49.360 --> 07:20:50.360
For some reason.

07:20:54.360 --> 07:20:56.360
I went for it too often.

07:20:58.360 --> 07:20:59.360
We're so rude.

07:21:00.360 --> 07:21:01.360
Slanted.

07:21:02.360 --> 07:21:08.360
There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach.

07:21:09.360 --> 07:21:11.360
If you're trying.

07:21:12.360 --> 07:21:14.360
Oh, I'm breaking free.

07:21:16.360 --> 07:21:17.360
I can't remember the rest of it.

07:21:25.360 --> 07:21:26.360
Does it still have a parachute?

07:21:26.360 --> 07:21:29.360
Yeah, I have four more inventory.

07:21:29.360 --> 07:21:31.360
I can't believe it.

07:21:31.360 --> 07:21:32.360
I can't believe it.

07:21:32.360 --> 07:21:34.360
I can't believe this castle is full of guards.

07:21:35.360 --> 07:21:37.360
Shot and behaviour.

07:21:37.360 --> 07:21:38.360
Get out.

07:21:38.360 --> 07:21:39.360
Anyone wants you here?

07:21:39.360 --> 07:21:40.360
Oh, my ankles.

07:21:40.360 --> 07:21:42.360
I didn't take any fall damage.

07:21:42.360 --> 07:21:43.360
Okay.

07:21:44.360 --> 07:21:45.360
I love your...

07:21:45.360 --> 07:21:47.360
Yeah, you're like when I burst into Scott swinging.

07:21:47.360 --> 07:21:48.360
My wee accent.

07:21:51.360 --> 07:21:53.360
I should do a Scott or some cover.

07:21:53.360 --> 07:21:54.360
I don't know what to do.

07:21:54.360 --> 07:21:55.360
I wanted to do an M&M one,

07:21:55.360 --> 07:21:56.360
but I was like...

07:21:56.360 --> 07:21:58.360
I don't know if it's bordering on cringe.

07:21:59.360 --> 07:22:00.360
She was like...

07:22:01.360 --> 07:22:03.360
I don't know what M&M song I wanted to do.

07:22:03.360 --> 07:22:04.360
I don't know what song.

07:22:04.360 --> 07:22:05.360
I don't know.

07:22:08.360 --> 07:22:09.360
I've got any clue.

07:22:10.360 --> 07:22:12.360
You've got any clue what's going on there?

07:22:12.360 --> 07:22:13.360
No, you didn't.

07:22:13.360 --> 07:22:14.360
You've gone back.

07:22:14.360 --> 07:22:15.360
Sorry.

07:22:17.360 --> 07:22:18.360
You threw me.

07:22:18.360 --> 07:22:20.360
I don't know what one to do.

07:22:20.360 --> 07:22:24.360
I'm beginning to feel like a wee bit of a rap god.

07:22:27.360 --> 07:22:28.360
I don't know.

07:22:29.360 --> 07:22:35.360
Yes, who's back, back, back, back again, again, again.

07:22:36.360 --> 07:22:40.360
Strony's back, back, back, tell a friend.

07:22:40.360 --> 07:22:44.360
Oh, everyone report to the dance floor.

07:22:44.360 --> 07:22:48.360
It's your season to be butt squeezing.

07:22:48.360 --> 07:22:49.360
That made me snore.

07:22:49.360 --> 07:22:50.360
I'm so sorry.

07:22:53.360 --> 07:22:54.360
Touch my body.

07:22:54.360 --> 07:22:56.360
I mean, is it boy just touch my body?

07:22:56.360 --> 07:22:58.360
I mean, girl, just touch my body.

07:22:59.360 --> 07:23:01.360
Because this is the part where the rap breaks down.

07:23:01.360 --> 07:23:02.360
No one moves.

07:23:02.360 --> 07:23:03.360
No one makes a sound.

07:23:03.360 --> 07:23:06.360
I'm just mixing into a ton of different songs, I think.

07:23:07.360 --> 07:23:08.360
Back to reality.

07:23:08.360 --> 07:23:09.360
There goes gravity.

07:23:09.360 --> 07:23:10.360
There goes...

07:23:10.360 --> 07:23:11.360
Doesn't have any.

07:23:11.360 --> 07:23:13.360
There goes gravity again.

07:23:13.360 --> 07:23:14.360
I don't know.

07:23:16.360 --> 07:23:17.360
Okay, that was very lucky.

07:23:17.360 --> 07:23:19.360
You can actually go backwards.

07:23:21.360 --> 07:23:22.360
Are we a big fan of M&M?

07:23:22.360 --> 07:23:23.360
No.

07:23:24.360 --> 07:23:25.360
Not like...

07:23:26.360 --> 07:23:28.360
Oh, I know all the albums and stuff.

07:23:28.360 --> 07:23:29.360
It's just the goofy songs.

07:23:29.360 --> 07:23:30.360
I like it.

07:23:30.360 --> 07:23:31.360
I can't believe it.

07:23:33.360 --> 07:23:35.360
I love Scottish M&M.

07:23:41.360 --> 07:23:42.360
That one's good one.

07:23:50.360 --> 07:23:52.360
The spaghetti on this shirt.

07:23:52.360 --> 07:23:54.360
No, there's vomit on his shirt.

07:23:54.360 --> 07:23:55.360
Mum's spaghetti.

07:23:58.360 --> 07:23:59.360
I'm a jukebox.

07:24:02.360 --> 07:24:04.360
Okay, now we need this as a carry, okay?

07:24:05.360 --> 07:24:06.360
Oh, there goes gravity.

07:24:06.360 --> 07:24:07.360
Oh, there goes a rabbit.

07:24:07.360 --> 07:24:08.360
That's not the lyrics.

07:24:08.360 --> 07:24:09.360
You're teasing me.

07:24:12.360 --> 07:24:14.360
Scottish Kendrick Lamar wins.

07:24:22.360 --> 07:24:23.360
I don't know the words.

07:24:23.360 --> 07:24:25.360
I don't even know if that was Kendrick Lamar.

07:24:25.360 --> 07:24:26.360
I'm going to be honest.

07:24:27.360 --> 07:24:28.360
No, that was Denzel Watt.

07:24:28.360 --> 07:24:29.360
No.

07:24:29.360 --> 07:24:30.360
Wait, hold on.

07:24:31.360 --> 07:24:32.360
Hold on.

07:24:32.360 --> 07:24:33.360
Brain farming.

07:24:33.360 --> 07:24:35.360
Sitting here repeating YouTube work on my Scottish accent.

07:24:35.360 --> 07:24:37.360
I really know many other...

07:24:37.360 --> 07:24:38.360
Right.

07:24:39.360 --> 07:24:42.360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

07:24:42.360 --> 07:24:44.360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

07:24:44.360 --> 07:24:46.360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

07:24:46.360 --> 07:24:48.360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

07:24:48.360 --> 07:24:50.360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

07:24:50.360 --> 07:24:52.360
I was in the 212 on the Uptown A.

07:24:52.360 --> 07:24:54.360
You know what's up or won't you?

07:24:54.360 --> 07:24:56.360
That's not really...

07:24:58.360 --> 07:25:00.360
500 accumulative meters.

07:25:00.360 --> 07:25:03.360
500 accumulative meters.

07:25:03.360 --> 07:25:07.360
I don't want to fly up off that fricking building again.

07:25:07.360 --> 07:25:10.360
500 accumulative meters, please.

07:25:15.360 --> 07:25:16.360
I can't believe it.

07:25:17.360 --> 07:25:18.360
That's it.

07:25:18.360 --> 07:25:19.360
Put the tunes on.

07:25:19.360 --> 07:25:21.360
We're rapping in Scots.

07:25:21.360 --> 07:25:26.360
Because how on earth was that not 500 accumulative meters?

07:25:26.360 --> 07:25:30.360
500 accumulative meters.

07:25:30.360 --> 07:25:37.360
I only ask for 500 meters.

07:25:38.360 --> 07:25:39.360
Hmm.

07:25:46.360 --> 07:25:47.360
Talk to my assassins.

07:25:47.360 --> 07:25:49.360
Because Exio ain't listening.

07:25:50.360 --> 07:25:52.360
We suck at rap battle.

07:25:52.360 --> 07:25:54.360
You want us to rap battle each other?

07:25:54.360 --> 07:25:55.360
Honestly?

07:25:56.360 --> 07:25:57.360
Right.

07:25:57.360 --> 07:26:00.360
This is going to be really obviously kind of spoilers if you'd be here.

07:26:00.360 --> 07:26:03.360
Well, it's not really spoilers because it would have to be discussed anyway.

07:26:03.360 --> 07:26:06.360
I really thought it would be fun to have diss tracks made.

07:26:06.360 --> 07:26:08.360
Like make diss tracks on each other.

07:26:09.360 --> 07:26:11.360
So obviously they'd be like,

07:26:11.360 --> 07:26:13.360
Strongly cuttles can't even see your name right.

07:26:13.360 --> 07:26:15.360
Because you're Scottish, you know what I mean?

07:26:15.360 --> 07:26:17.360
If I don't know how to do that,

07:26:17.360 --> 07:26:21.360
I would have to unegronically commission someone to diss each other.

07:26:21.360 --> 07:26:24.360
But I think a diss track on each other would be so funny.

07:26:24.360 --> 07:26:26.360
I know it's brain dead, but I don't know.

07:26:26.360 --> 07:26:27.360
I just want to find out the content that's funny.

07:26:27.360 --> 07:26:29.360
Like interact with each other in that kind of way.

07:26:29.360 --> 07:26:30.360
Words, yeah.

07:26:30.360 --> 07:26:36.360
Like she be caught in bomb or like pretending to be your mom.

07:26:36.360 --> 07:26:42.360
Oh, you know, because you know, she's a male.

07:26:42.360 --> 07:26:45.360
But she hasn't spawned in a child from her loins.

07:26:45.360 --> 07:26:48.360
Like, oh, like, oh, what this, what this,

07:26:48.360 --> 07:26:50.360
but I don't know how like this tracks work.

07:26:50.360 --> 07:26:53.360
I don't know how you make them or anything like that.

07:26:54.360 --> 07:26:58.360
And like Azura Dooley, more like Azura Doo-Gay.

07:26:58.360 --> 07:27:04.360
Oh, I mean Beezoo, more like, I mean, your brother's dead.

07:27:04.360 --> 07:27:13.360
Oh, I see snow paws, more like a brat with just claws.

07:27:13.360 --> 07:27:18.360
Oh, this is awful.

07:27:19.360 --> 07:27:20.360
Merci, modest.

07:27:20.360 --> 07:27:21.360
Yeah, nothing.

07:27:21.360 --> 07:27:24.360
Yeah, your dress wear isn't modest at all.

07:27:24.360 --> 07:27:26.360
You just slagged your dress like a slag.

07:27:30.360 --> 07:27:32.360
Like how do you make diss tracks?

07:27:32.360 --> 07:27:33.360
I don't know.

07:27:39.360 --> 07:27:40.360
That didn't even rain.

07:27:43.360 --> 07:27:44.360
I just don't know how.

07:27:44.360 --> 07:27:46.360
Like how do people think of it?

07:27:46.360 --> 07:27:49.360
Like, you have to go right away and write something.

07:27:52.360 --> 07:27:53.360
I was like that.

07:27:53.360 --> 07:27:55.360
I don't know if you've seen the meme where it's like,

07:27:55.360 --> 07:27:56.360
you're deadly.

07:27:58.360 --> 07:28:01.360
You're deadly nails out of the garden, the scruffy nose.

07:28:03.360 --> 07:28:06.360
Like that's how we end up doing a diss track

07:28:06.360 --> 07:28:09.360
because I feel so much pressure to like say something.

07:28:10.360 --> 07:28:16.360
It's like, it just doesn't make any sense.

07:28:16.360 --> 07:28:19.360
Like, I just don't know how people come up with like actually,

07:28:19.360 --> 07:28:22.360
like, you know how epic rap battles is like so good?

07:28:22.360 --> 07:28:27.360
Like, whose rap flows the dopest Marilyn Monroe's

07:28:27.360 --> 07:28:31.360
upthrown pharaohs, like opposes like Moses or something like that.

07:28:31.360 --> 07:28:34.360
Um, like that is so good.

07:28:34.360 --> 07:28:36.360
And I'm like, how do people know that?

07:28:36.360 --> 07:28:38.360
We can do epic rap battles.

07:28:38.360 --> 07:28:39.360
VTuber style.

07:28:39.360 --> 07:28:40.360
Come on.

07:28:40.360 --> 07:28:41.360
Oh, stop reading my mind.

07:28:41.360 --> 07:28:42.360
Literally though.

07:28:44.360 --> 07:28:45.360
Literally though.

07:28:46.360 --> 07:28:47.360
I should.

07:28:49.360 --> 07:28:50.360
Yeah.

07:28:50.360 --> 07:28:52.360
Yeah, they spend more times on the like,

07:28:52.360 --> 07:28:53.360
get idea wrong.

07:28:56.360 --> 07:28:58.360
Maybe VTuber should do rap battles,

07:28:58.360 --> 07:29:01.360
but like the problem is I don't have any music or lyrical thing.

07:29:01.360 --> 07:29:04.360
So I would have to like go out and commission to do it.

07:29:04.360 --> 07:29:05.360
I don't need to grab VTubers.

07:29:05.360 --> 07:29:07.360
I'd be willing to like let us diss each other.

07:29:07.360 --> 07:29:12.360
Like, oh, I don't even know how I would diss myself.

07:29:14.360 --> 07:29:16.360
Oh, I don't know.

07:29:17.360 --> 07:29:20.360
Probably like, oh, schizophrenic personality disorder.

07:29:20.360 --> 07:29:24.360
Oh, but you're like, that's probably how you get me.

07:29:24.360 --> 07:29:25.360
She's been streaming seven hours.

07:29:25.360 --> 07:29:26.360
That's what you hate.

07:29:26.360 --> 07:29:27.360
Yeah, I am.

07:29:27.360 --> 07:29:28.360
Right.

07:29:28.360 --> 07:29:30.360
Repeat after me.

07:29:30.360 --> 07:29:33.360
500 accumulative mirrors.

07:29:33.360 --> 07:29:35.360
500 accumulative mirrors.

07:29:35.360 --> 07:29:37.360
500 accumulative mirrors.

07:29:37.360 --> 07:29:40.360
500 accumulative mirrors.

07:29:40.360 --> 07:29:43.360
Accumulative mirrors.

07:29:43.360 --> 07:29:46.360
500, please.

07:29:46.360 --> 07:29:52.360
500 accumulative mirrors.

07:29:52.360 --> 07:29:55.360
Because I don't want to do that anymore.

07:29:55.360 --> 07:29:58.360
I'll probably do something else if we don't hit it this time

07:29:58.360 --> 07:30:00.360
and that's okay.

07:30:00.360 --> 07:30:05.360
But we're asking for 500 accumulative mirrors.

07:30:05.360 --> 07:30:06.360
Yay!

07:30:06.360 --> 07:30:07.360
We did it!

07:30:07.360 --> 07:30:08.360
We did it!

07:30:08.360 --> 07:30:10.360
Okay, it takes three times to jump off together.

07:30:10.360 --> 07:30:11.360
Okay.

07:30:11.360 --> 07:30:13.360
Oh, let's do a cheeky air assassination.

07:30:13.360 --> 07:30:14.360
Oh, I can't.

07:30:14.360 --> 07:30:15.360
I'm out of bounds.

07:30:15.360 --> 07:30:18.360
Sorry, just dropping in for the third time today.

07:30:18.360 --> 07:30:21.360
Oh, I just looked up my own scout there.

07:30:21.360 --> 07:30:22.360
We did it.

07:30:22.360 --> 07:30:23.360
We did it.

07:30:23.360 --> 07:30:28.360
Right, now we need to figure out what on earth these guilds want from us.

07:30:28.360 --> 07:30:29.360
Let's see.

07:30:29.360 --> 07:30:30.360
Guild challenges.

07:30:30.360 --> 07:30:31.360
Assassins.

07:30:31.360 --> 07:30:32.360
Like, fully done.

07:30:32.360 --> 07:30:33.360
Yeah, okay.

07:30:33.360 --> 07:30:34.360
Okay, it's done.

07:30:34.360 --> 07:30:35.360
Cheeky Flash.

07:30:35.360 --> 07:30:36.360
Cheeky Flash.

07:30:36.360 --> 07:30:37.360
Right.

07:30:37.360 --> 07:30:38.360
Brutes killed.

07:30:38.360 --> 07:30:39.360
Scaffolding by guards.

07:30:39.360 --> 07:30:41.360
PayPal guards.

07:30:41.360 --> 07:30:47.360
The PayPal guards are back there.

07:30:47.360 --> 07:30:50.360
Guards killed while on horseback.

07:30:50.360 --> 07:30:53.360
Guards on horseback air assassinated.

07:30:53.360 --> 07:30:55.360
Double assassination.

07:30:55.360 --> 07:30:58.360
Five guards disarmed and killed with their own weapon.

07:30:58.360 --> 07:31:00.360
I'm going to be honest, I've actually already done one of that.

07:31:00.360 --> 07:31:01.360
I know for a fact I have.

07:31:01.360 --> 07:31:03.360
I have a five-man kill streak.

07:31:03.360 --> 07:31:05.360
Mm, okay, is there anything easier?

07:31:05.360 --> 07:31:07.360
Oh, we've actually done quite a lot.

07:31:07.360 --> 07:31:11.360
Evade enemies using the crowd or other hiding spots.

07:31:11.360 --> 07:31:14.360
Enemies stationed at a guard post while using a crossbow.

07:31:14.360 --> 07:31:16.360
I actually know how to do that.

07:31:16.360 --> 07:31:22.360
Horses belonging to guards commandeered without killing the rider,

07:31:22.360 --> 07:31:24.360
and guards killed in a smoke bomb.

07:31:24.360 --> 07:31:28.360
Right, we'll do that right now because we can do the smoke bomb.

07:31:28.360 --> 07:31:29.360
Hello.

07:31:29.360 --> 07:31:30.360
Hello.

07:31:30.360 --> 07:31:32.360
I'm going to kill you.

07:31:32.360 --> 07:31:34.360
Oh, that was...

07:31:34.360 --> 07:31:36.360
Right, take your time.

07:31:36.360 --> 07:31:40.360
Right, and then I'm going to get rid of this one.

07:31:40.360 --> 07:31:42.360
Oh, well, I'm going to get double assassination,

07:31:42.360 --> 07:31:46.360
and then I'm going to take his sword.

07:31:46.360 --> 07:31:47.360
Oh, he can.

07:31:47.360 --> 07:31:49.360
He's not weak enough.

07:31:49.360 --> 07:31:52.360
Sugar.

07:31:52.360 --> 07:31:54.360
Uh, right.

07:31:54.360 --> 07:31:57.360
We did the smoke bomb, which is fantastic.

07:31:57.360 --> 07:32:00.360
Um...

07:32:00.360 --> 07:32:02.360
7.68%.

07:32:02.360 --> 07:32:04.360
Is it actually?

07:32:04.360 --> 07:32:05.360
No more kill.

07:32:05.360 --> 07:32:06.360
Actually, I did the coppers kill.

07:32:06.360 --> 07:32:08.360
That's terrible.

07:32:08.360 --> 07:32:10.360
Kilty, kilty, cold bum.

07:32:10.360 --> 07:32:14.360
Did you know when you were killed, you're not supposed to wear any...

07:32:14.360 --> 07:32:16.360
Greeks under it.

07:32:16.360 --> 07:32:20.360
Mm...

07:32:20.360 --> 07:32:22.360
Did I need to write these on a note?

07:32:22.360 --> 07:32:24.360
I think I actually have to.

07:32:24.360 --> 07:32:26.360
Uh...

07:32:26.360 --> 07:32:28.360
Yeah.

07:32:28.360 --> 07:32:29.360
This is like so much.

07:32:29.360 --> 07:32:34.360
Right, the papal guards are...

07:32:34.360 --> 07:32:37.360
actually back across the bridge.

07:32:37.360 --> 07:32:39.360
You know that.

07:32:39.360 --> 07:32:41.360
Excuse me, how about your horse?

07:32:41.360 --> 07:32:42.360
Oh, fine.

07:32:42.360 --> 07:32:46.360
Right, I'll call him on.

07:32:46.360 --> 07:32:49.360
What item do you steal from the other guards?

07:32:49.360 --> 07:32:50.360
I answered...

07:32:50.360 --> 07:32:51.360
Oh, I answered that.

07:32:51.360 --> 07:32:53.360
But it's a bit inappropriate.

07:32:53.360 --> 07:32:57.360
I'm not sure I should say it again.

07:32:57.360 --> 07:32:58.360
Right, here.

07:32:58.360 --> 07:33:00.360
These are where these guards...

07:33:00.360 --> 07:33:02.360
These ones spawn.

07:33:02.360 --> 07:33:05.360
So, we're going to need to like come back and then...

07:33:05.360 --> 07:33:06.360
Oh, don't shoot me.

07:33:06.360 --> 07:33:08.360
That's not nice.

07:33:08.360 --> 07:33:12.360
Whoa, you weren't even aiming at me, bro.

07:33:12.360 --> 07:33:13.360
I don't want to...

07:33:13.360 --> 07:33:14.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:33:14.360 --> 07:33:15.360
Right, okay, okay.

07:33:15.360 --> 07:33:16.360
Okay, okay, okay.

07:33:16.360 --> 07:33:17.360
You're done.

07:33:17.360 --> 07:33:18.360
You're done.

07:33:18.360 --> 07:33:20.360
Well, because I am, you're dead.

07:33:20.360 --> 07:33:23.360
Don't waste my time.

07:33:23.360 --> 07:33:25.360
Stinks.

07:33:25.360 --> 07:33:26.360
Take that.

07:33:26.360 --> 07:33:28.360
These are the only location...

07:33:28.360 --> 07:33:30.360
I know these type of guards spawn.

07:33:30.360 --> 07:33:33.360
I'm like 99% sure.

07:33:33.360 --> 07:33:38.360
I don't think anyone else spawn here.

07:33:38.360 --> 07:33:48.360
Right, and then you.

07:33:48.360 --> 07:33:49.360
Here you go.

07:33:49.360 --> 07:33:51.360
Here's some money.

07:33:51.360 --> 07:33:52.360
Me.

07:33:52.360 --> 07:33:53.360
Here we go.

07:33:53.360 --> 07:33:54.360
That's my money.

07:33:54.360 --> 07:33:58.360
I don't know.

07:33:58.360 --> 07:34:00.360
This beast is beautiful.

07:34:00.360 --> 07:34:01.360
Beautiful?

07:34:01.360 --> 07:34:07.360
I don't know how to respawn those guys in without like going around doing something else.

07:34:07.360 --> 07:34:14.360
Should we do Quarters on Assignment?

07:34:14.360 --> 07:34:15.360
No.

07:34:15.360 --> 07:34:18.360
I need to do a lot of horse activities.

07:34:18.360 --> 07:34:20.360
That sounds bizarre.

07:34:20.360 --> 07:34:23.360
Out of context.

07:34:23.360 --> 07:34:27.360
Have I got a pen and paper for my brain?

07:34:27.360 --> 07:34:31.360
I don't know.

07:34:31.360 --> 07:34:35.360
I'm literally going to write this on the discord.

07:34:35.360 --> 07:34:40.360
So the girls are like, what the heck are you typing about?

07:34:40.360 --> 07:34:42.360
Right, let's see.

07:34:42.360 --> 07:34:45.360
I need to...

07:34:45.360 --> 07:34:49.360
Right, I've killed four more people.

07:34:49.360 --> 07:34:53.360
I have to like open it and then show it in the next.

07:34:53.360 --> 07:34:56.360
Killstreak and then...

07:34:56.360 --> 07:35:00.360
I need to evade...

07:35:01.360 --> 07:35:04.360
Evade four times or something.

07:35:04.360 --> 07:35:07.360
I've already forgotten the other freaking thing I was supposed to do.

07:35:07.360 --> 07:35:09.360
One enemy stationed at Guard Post.

07:35:09.360 --> 07:35:14.360
Okay, we're actually going to station Guard Post.

07:35:14.360 --> 07:35:18.360
We're actually going to do that in a memory because there's a memory that enables that.

07:35:18.360 --> 07:35:21.360
Horses belonging to guards commandeered.

07:35:21.360 --> 07:35:28.360
Horses yoinked without killing.

07:35:28.360 --> 07:35:30.360
Do you want me to screenshot and post on the discord?

07:35:30.360 --> 07:35:32.360
I just need to do the last one.

07:35:32.360 --> 07:35:34.360
Oh, I can screenshot it.

07:35:34.360 --> 07:35:36.360
I don't even have to type it out.

07:35:36.360 --> 07:35:37.360
Can I screenshot it?

07:35:37.360 --> 07:35:38.360
Did that screenshot work?

07:35:38.360 --> 07:35:40.360
I don't even think I did.

07:35:40.360 --> 07:35:42.360
It did.

07:35:42.360 --> 07:35:44.360
Okay.

07:35:44.360 --> 07:35:46.360
Okay, that worked.

07:35:46.360 --> 07:35:48.360
Okay, it worked.

07:35:48.360 --> 07:35:50.360
I am so smart.

07:35:50.360 --> 07:35:53.360
SMRT.

07:35:53.360 --> 07:35:56.360
Okay, let's see.

07:35:56.360 --> 07:36:01.360
Put that there so I don't miss any donations if someone tips.

07:36:01.360 --> 07:36:04.360
And then put the discord there.

07:36:04.360 --> 07:36:06.360
And now I can...

07:36:06.360 --> 07:36:07.360
Oh wait, no.

07:36:07.360 --> 07:36:08.360
I can't see it.

07:36:08.360 --> 07:36:11.360
Oh, the screenshot makes it so tiny that I can't see it.

07:36:11.360 --> 07:36:12.360
I need to type it out.

07:36:12.360 --> 07:36:13.360
Six.

07:36:13.360 --> 07:36:15.360
Six thieves lured.

07:36:15.360 --> 07:36:16.360
I did it for anyway.

07:36:16.360 --> 07:36:17.360
Now, that's the picture.

07:36:17.360 --> 07:36:20.360
It's because if it's a picture, I need to have the discord in small.

07:36:20.360 --> 07:36:22.360
Sprint uninterrupted.

07:36:22.360 --> 07:36:25.360
Sprint for 300.

07:36:26.360 --> 07:36:28.360
21 leaps of faith.

07:36:28.360 --> 07:36:31.360
I need to do 40 leaps of faith.

07:36:31.360 --> 07:36:34.360
So you don't really do leaps of faith anymore.

07:36:34.360 --> 07:36:36.360
Guard's heir assassinated from a beam.

07:36:36.360 --> 07:36:40.360
Guard's heir assassinated from a beam.

07:36:40.360 --> 07:36:43.360
Unless, but certainly not least,

07:36:43.360 --> 07:36:46.360
jump from a horse to a beam.

07:36:46.360 --> 07:36:48.360
Jump from horse to beam.

07:36:48.360 --> 07:36:51.360
Yeah, there's actually like so much horse related ones.

07:36:51.360 --> 07:36:53.360
This is surprising.

07:36:53.360 --> 07:36:55.360
I didn't actually expect...

07:36:57.360 --> 07:36:59.360
Oh, Azura just messaged me.

07:36:59.360 --> 07:37:00.360
Oh.

07:37:00.360 --> 07:37:02.360
What's she saying?

07:37:03.360 --> 07:37:05.360
Ah, okay.

07:37:06.360 --> 07:37:07.360
It's MRT.

07:37:07.360 --> 07:37:08.360
Oh my god.

07:37:08.360 --> 07:37:11.360
The girls are posting in the not-safe-for-work section of the discord.

07:37:11.360 --> 07:37:13.360
Now look at it.

07:37:17.360 --> 07:37:18.360
I think it may be...

07:37:18.360 --> 07:37:21.360
Oh, it actually may be my gifted artwork.

07:37:21.360 --> 07:37:22.360
Open it.

07:37:24.360 --> 07:37:25.360
It's MRT.

07:37:25.360 --> 07:37:27.360
Oh wait, I've just closed the discord.

07:37:27.360 --> 07:37:28.360
Oops.

07:37:28.360 --> 07:37:31.360
The discord actually holds everything that I need in order to play the game.

07:37:31.360 --> 07:37:33.360
Look at dum-dum.

07:37:33.360 --> 07:37:35.360
It's MRT.

07:37:35.360 --> 07:37:37.360
No, that's Samarty.

07:37:39.360 --> 07:37:41.360
Wow, I can't believe it.

07:37:41.360 --> 07:37:45.360
I might unironically need a third moner for this kind of stuff.

07:37:48.360 --> 07:37:49.360
Okay.

07:37:52.360 --> 07:37:55.360
Someone at Ubisoft is really proud of the horses.

07:37:55.360 --> 07:38:00.360
Honestly, it probably took like a heckish and hellish...

07:38:00.360 --> 07:38:01.360
Oh, wait.

07:38:01.360 --> 07:38:02.360
I'm freaking dumb.

07:38:02.360 --> 07:38:04.360
Why am I so dumb?

07:38:05.360 --> 07:38:06.360
Dum-dum-dum.

07:38:06.360 --> 07:38:07.360
Okay, wait.

07:38:07.360 --> 07:38:08.360
Hold on.

07:38:08.360 --> 07:38:11.360
Hold the freaking telephone.

07:38:12.360 --> 07:38:14.360
Okay, there we go.

07:38:14.360 --> 07:38:16.360
I definitely need a third moner.

07:38:16.360 --> 07:38:20.360
Honestly, I felt that right now as I'm currently trying to like arrange so many things.

07:38:20.360 --> 07:38:22.360
Okay, hydration check.

07:38:31.360 --> 07:38:33.360
I am going to do one...

07:38:33.360 --> 07:38:35.360
Yeah, one of those portrait moners.

07:38:35.360 --> 07:38:38.360
Yeah, definitely like chat-orientating.

07:38:38.360 --> 07:38:39.360
Right.

07:38:39.360 --> 07:38:45.360
Because there's so many horses once, I'm actually going to take us to the thieves district

07:38:45.360 --> 07:38:49.360
if I can find a fast port, which I can at the...

07:38:49.360 --> 07:38:51.360
Rosa in Fiori.

07:38:52.360 --> 07:38:54.360
Merci.

07:38:55.360 --> 07:38:56.360
One hour, 20 minutes.

07:38:56.360 --> 07:38:58.360
Merci.

07:39:00.360 --> 07:39:01.360
Merci.

07:39:09.360 --> 07:39:11.360
Merci didn't know what countdown was.

07:39:11.360 --> 07:39:12.360
Yeah.

07:39:16.360 --> 07:39:17.360
I...

07:39:17.360 --> 07:39:19.360
I'm like...

07:39:19.360 --> 07:39:20.360
All our...

07:39:20.360 --> 07:39:23.360
All like, Merci's senpais are more deceased.

07:39:23.360 --> 07:39:25.360
Oh!

07:39:26.360 --> 07:39:29.360
Merci just catches the street a little bit.

07:39:30.360 --> 07:39:31.360
What?

07:39:31.360 --> 07:39:33.360
I'm dissing my...

07:39:33.360 --> 07:39:35.360
My fellow gen mate,

07:39:35.360 --> 07:39:38.360
but I'm so bad at like dissing because I just...

07:39:38.360 --> 07:39:40.360
Like, I...

07:39:40.360 --> 07:39:44.360
Oh, I need to put you in the scaffold and please let me grab you.

07:39:44.360 --> 07:39:45.360
No, no, no.

07:39:45.360 --> 07:39:46.360
I don't want to fight.

07:39:46.360 --> 07:39:47.360
I don't want to fight.

07:39:47.360 --> 07:39:48.360
I don't want to fight.

07:39:48.360 --> 07:39:49.360
Please, can I grab you?

07:39:49.360 --> 07:39:50.360
Can I grab you?

07:39:50.360 --> 07:39:52.360
Wait, I can't grab them when they're in.

07:39:52.360 --> 07:39:53.360
Right.

07:39:53.360 --> 07:39:55.360
That's two of three.

07:39:55.360 --> 07:39:56.360
Ah!

07:39:56.360 --> 07:39:58.360
Leave me alone!

07:39:58.360 --> 07:40:01.360
Is there any more scaffolding?

07:40:01.360 --> 07:40:06.360
If there's more scaffolding, now's the time to reveal yourself.

07:40:09.360 --> 07:40:11.360
There is!

07:40:12.360 --> 07:40:14.360
Please come this way.

07:40:14.360 --> 07:40:15.360
Please come this way.

07:40:15.360 --> 07:40:17.360
Oh, look at this lovely scaffolding

07:40:17.360 --> 07:40:19.360
that someone's put up for it.

07:40:19.360 --> 07:40:20.360
Damn, she cooking.

07:40:20.360 --> 07:40:22.360
Merci, what's she doing?

07:40:22.360 --> 07:40:24.360
Zero, I'm trying to diss tracks,

07:40:24.360 --> 07:40:26.360
but I'm absolutely rubbish at them.

07:40:28.360 --> 07:40:30.360
And I'm like, trying to pretend I know how to

07:40:30.360 --> 07:40:31.360
frickin' diss tracks,

07:40:31.360 --> 07:40:33.360
but it's plausible.

07:40:38.360 --> 07:40:39.360
Now, you're not coming over.

07:40:39.360 --> 07:40:40.360
Come here, right now.

07:40:40.360 --> 07:40:41.360
Come here.

07:40:41.360 --> 07:40:42.360
Come here.

07:40:44.360 --> 07:40:45.360
I'm wondering...

07:40:45.360 --> 07:40:46.360
Oh, this is terrible.

07:40:46.360 --> 07:40:48.360
This isn't going to work out well, I don't think.

07:40:48.360 --> 07:40:49.360
Tell these two.

07:40:49.360 --> 07:40:52.360
Right, we've got a double assassination out of that.

07:40:52.360 --> 07:40:53.360
No!

07:40:53.360 --> 07:40:54.360
It's you.

07:40:54.360 --> 07:40:57.360
You're a bit too efficient at your job.

07:40:57.360 --> 07:41:00.360
I didn't actually want to assassinate them.

07:41:00.360 --> 07:41:02.360
I'm talking about a third monitor,

07:41:02.360 --> 07:41:04.360
and I still only have one.

07:41:04.360 --> 07:41:05.360
Ah!

07:41:05.360 --> 07:41:08.360
If you're going to be sure, you might need three.

07:41:11.360 --> 07:41:13.360
Momet and Mummy are here.

07:41:13.360 --> 07:41:14.360
Yeah.

07:41:14.360 --> 07:41:16.360
Or Mommy.

07:41:18.360 --> 07:41:19.360
Wait, what do I need to do?

07:41:19.360 --> 07:41:21.360
I need to go do horse missions!

07:41:21.360 --> 07:41:24.360
Right, we're going to go to the Thieves Guild,

07:41:24.360 --> 07:41:27.360
which I totally know the name of.

07:41:28.360 --> 07:41:30.360
The Thieves Guild.

07:41:30.360 --> 07:41:33.360
Why is it all the way down here?

07:41:34.360 --> 07:41:36.360
I feel like the last one.

07:41:36.360 --> 07:41:38.360
You know what?

07:41:41.360 --> 07:41:42.360
Yeah, you're dumb.

07:41:42.360 --> 07:41:44.360
Mm-hmm, you're dumb.

07:41:44.360 --> 07:41:45.360
She would never diss me.

07:41:45.360 --> 07:41:47.360
She would love me.

07:41:47.360 --> 07:41:50.360
Oh, I can't remember what my diss was on you.

07:41:50.360 --> 07:41:52.360
I thought I was like Azuridule, more like...

07:41:52.360 --> 07:41:53.360
Oh, that's what I was like.

07:41:53.360 --> 07:41:55.360
Azuridule, more like Azuriduke.

07:41:55.360 --> 07:41:58.360
That's really like the most rubbish thing.

07:41:58.360 --> 07:42:00.360
Like nonsense.

07:42:00.360 --> 07:42:01.360
What's wrong with you?

07:42:01.360 --> 07:42:02.360
Visual number of hurricanes.

07:42:02.360 --> 07:42:03.360
Are we allowed to recommend?

07:42:03.360 --> 07:42:04.360
Yeah, you can always recommend stuff.

07:42:04.360 --> 07:42:05.360
That's not a problem at all.

07:42:05.360 --> 07:42:08.360
Right, horse activities.

07:42:08.360 --> 07:42:11.360
Right, I need to run 300 meters uninterrupted.

07:42:11.360 --> 07:42:14.360
You can do it at this section super duper easily.

07:42:14.360 --> 07:42:16.360
Definitely recommend going to the Thieves Guild

07:42:16.360 --> 07:42:18.360
in order to do this.

07:42:18.360 --> 07:42:20.360
Azuridule, more like Fontal Abyssum.

07:42:25.360 --> 07:42:29.360
Your third monitor should be used exclusively to ignore chat.

07:42:29.360 --> 07:42:31.360
Why would I ignore chat?

07:42:31.360 --> 07:42:33.360
It's literally the best part of streaming.

07:42:36.360 --> 07:42:38.360
Other than, like, when the gameplay gets intense,

07:42:38.360 --> 07:42:41.360
then, uh, some things need to be slowed down.

07:42:41.360 --> 07:42:43.360
Is there, like, a perfect circle here?

07:42:43.360 --> 07:42:45.360
Can I just go in circles?

07:42:45.360 --> 07:42:47.360
If you get motion sick, close your eyes.

07:42:47.360 --> 07:42:48.360
Mercy, look away.

07:42:48.360 --> 07:42:50.360
Don't watch stream here, man.

07:42:53.360 --> 07:42:56.360
What would happen if Ezio had to turn for the feature bar?

07:42:56.360 --> 07:42:58.360
I think he'd have a lot of fan girls.

07:42:59.360 --> 07:43:01.360
Ay, hold on.

07:43:01.360 --> 07:43:03.360
Alright, what do I need to next?

07:43:07.360 --> 07:43:09.360
What?

07:43:09.360 --> 07:43:12.360
How have I got the Thieves Guild crest?

07:43:12.360 --> 07:43:13.360
I didn't do it.

07:43:13.360 --> 07:43:17.360
More like Stacey, these Milkretains, literally.

07:43:21.360 --> 07:43:25.360
She'd be calling herself a dumb winner.

07:43:25.360 --> 07:43:26.360
Winner.

07:43:26.360 --> 07:43:28.360
Protide name was literally cotton bomb.

07:43:28.360 --> 07:43:31.360
Yeah, get wrecked, yeah.

07:43:34.360 --> 07:43:37.360
Your dedication towards Ezio is highly respectable.

07:43:37.360 --> 07:43:39.360
It's a good game, what can I say?

07:43:39.360 --> 07:43:40.360
Right.

07:43:40.360 --> 07:43:44.360
Am I supposed to kill from being on a horse?

07:43:44.360 --> 07:43:46.360
Guards killed well on horseback.

07:43:46.360 --> 07:43:48.360
Let's go!

07:43:49.360 --> 07:43:51.360
Oh, hold on, let's try again.

07:43:51.360 --> 07:43:53.360
Hold on, let me get back on the horse.

07:43:53.360 --> 07:43:54.360
Sorry, sorry.

07:43:54.360 --> 07:43:56.360
Let me quit, excuse me, excuse me.

07:43:56.360 --> 07:43:59.360
Let me literally get back on the horse.

07:43:59.360 --> 07:44:02.360
I kid you not, literally let me get back on the horse.

07:44:03.360 --> 07:44:06.360
Stop, I know you're scared, but we need to try that again.

07:44:06.360 --> 07:44:09.360
I messed that up really badly, hold on.

07:44:09.360 --> 07:44:11.360
Okay, let's try that again.

07:44:11.360 --> 07:44:14.360
I've been destroyed, decimated.

07:44:14.360 --> 07:44:19.360
Just like how decimated your skin is when you interact with rabbits,

07:44:19.360 --> 07:44:20.360
because you're allergic.

07:44:20.360 --> 07:44:22.360
Ha, ha, ha, you're allergic.

07:44:22.360 --> 07:44:24.360
Yeah, I'm so good at doing this.

07:44:24.360 --> 07:44:26.360
This is awful, I'm so sorry.

07:44:26.360 --> 07:44:29.360
This is absolutely horrendous, I'm just gonna stop talking.

07:44:33.360 --> 07:44:34.360
Oh.

07:44:36.360 --> 07:44:37.360
I'm a horseback.

07:44:37.360 --> 07:44:41.360
Showing it on an old space commercial.

07:44:41.360 --> 07:44:44.360
Wow, low blow, just like the hate of rabbits.

07:44:44.360 --> 07:44:46.360
Oh, ooh.

07:44:48.360 --> 07:44:50.360
They just make my throat close now.

07:44:50.360 --> 07:44:53.360
Literally put you in anaphylactic shock.

07:44:53.360 --> 07:44:55.360
Oh, nothing measured though.

07:44:55.360 --> 07:44:57.360
Yeah.

07:44:57.360 --> 07:45:01.360
Okay, retconning the model we gave you right now.

07:45:01.360 --> 07:45:03.360
Holy crap.

07:45:03.360 --> 07:45:05.360
Double air assassination.

07:45:05.360 --> 07:45:07.360
Oh, it actually worked.

07:45:07.360 --> 07:45:08.360
Wow, okay.

07:45:08.360 --> 07:45:09.360
Owie.

07:45:09.360 --> 07:45:10.360
Wait, hold on.

07:45:10.360 --> 07:45:11.360
Horse, come back.

07:45:11.360 --> 07:45:12.360
Stop being scared.

07:45:12.360 --> 07:45:14.360
Where did the horse go?

07:45:14.360 --> 07:45:15.360
Is it?

07:45:15.360 --> 07:45:16.360
Oh, right, fine.

07:45:16.360 --> 07:45:18.360
I'm just calling my recruits in.

07:45:19.360 --> 07:45:20.360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:45:20.360 --> 07:45:21.360
We don't do this.

07:45:21.360 --> 07:45:23.360
Get me here, get me.

07:45:23.360 --> 07:45:26.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the people are fighting back.

07:45:26.360 --> 07:45:27.360
Take that.

07:45:27.360 --> 07:45:29.360
And this is stinky, stinky.

07:45:29.360 --> 07:45:31.360
Wait, that missed?

07:45:31.360 --> 07:45:33.360
Oh, well, I'll let this guy control that.

07:45:33.360 --> 07:45:34.360
Where's my horse?

07:45:34.360 --> 07:45:35.360
There's my horse.

07:45:35.360 --> 07:45:37.360
Okay, we did this.

07:45:37.360 --> 07:45:41.360
We need to just go around killing more guards from horseback.

07:45:41.360 --> 07:45:44.360
And then once that one's done, we'll move on to the next one.

07:45:44.360 --> 07:45:47.360
Hello, are there any guards?

07:45:48.360 --> 07:45:50.360
It seemed quieter.

07:45:50.360 --> 07:45:53.360
Hello, are there any guards?

07:45:56.360 --> 07:45:59.360
I get turned into a horse because they get...

07:45:59.360 --> 07:46:02.360
Oh, would you want to be a horse feature?

07:46:04.360 --> 07:46:08.360
If I would change into another animal,

07:46:10.360 --> 07:46:13.360
I'd maybe make you...

07:46:13.360 --> 07:46:15.360
What would I make you?

07:46:15.360 --> 07:46:19.360
Thank goodness I'm not on the development team anymore when it comes to that shiz.

07:46:19.360 --> 07:46:22.360
Don't worry, you're not getting any more bad names.

07:46:22.360 --> 07:46:23.360
No.

07:46:23.360 --> 07:46:24.360
No.

07:46:25.360 --> 07:46:26.360
Hi, Jack.

07:46:26.360 --> 07:46:28.360
I'm to commandeer a horse without killing.

07:46:28.360 --> 07:46:30.360
Okay, so that's one for the commandeering.

07:46:30.360 --> 07:46:33.360
Oh, my horse has like a little backpack now.

07:46:36.360 --> 07:46:38.360
Got a little backpack on the horse?

07:46:38.360 --> 07:46:41.360
Okay, so that just need to like keep running around, hoping to run into...

07:46:41.360 --> 07:46:43.360
Okay, here we go.

07:46:45.360 --> 07:46:47.360
Okay, that was one more.

07:46:49.360 --> 07:46:52.360
Okay, we're going to call in the assassins.

07:46:53.360 --> 07:46:56.360
As soon as they get on a horse, I don't like it.

07:46:56.360 --> 07:46:57.360
I get scared.

07:46:57.360 --> 07:46:58.360
Ooh!

07:46:58.360 --> 07:47:01.360
Oh, that was guard on horseback assassination.

07:47:01.360 --> 07:47:03.360
That was good, that was good.

07:47:03.360 --> 07:47:06.360
There's only been like three surprising ones.

07:47:07.360 --> 07:47:10.360
Let's see if we can do another double, maybe?

07:47:10.360 --> 07:47:12.360
Yeah, okay, nice double.

07:47:12.360 --> 07:47:14.360
We're racking up their numbers really quick.

07:47:15.360 --> 07:47:17.360
Alright, I'll let the assassins deal with this.

07:47:17.360 --> 07:47:19.360
I'm going to get this guy.

07:47:19.360 --> 07:47:20.360
I'm getting out of here.

07:47:20.360 --> 07:47:22.360
No, you're literally in my way.

07:47:25.360 --> 07:47:28.360
Horse features also have a very big buff because of the horse.

07:47:33.360 --> 07:47:37.360
Alright, we need to get back on a horsey-worsey.

07:47:38.360 --> 07:47:40.360
Hello!

07:47:41.360 --> 07:47:43.360
And then...

07:47:44.360 --> 07:47:49.360
We're getting there, we're slowly whittling it down to not much...

07:47:49.360 --> 07:47:51.360
Oh, I'm stuck on a rock.

07:47:54.360 --> 07:47:57.360
Alright, enemies, enemies, enemies.

07:47:57.360 --> 07:47:59.360
Oh, who we got, who we got?

07:47:59.360 --> 07:48:02.360
I just need to hijack without killing.

07:48:02.360 --> 07:48:05.360
Thank you, so that's two for ten.

07:48:06.360 --> 07:48:11.360
That's two for ten for commandeering a horse.

07:48:16.360 --> 07:48:20.360
I need to do the hide spot things, so maybe I'll go into the spale here in time.

07:48:20.360 --> 07:48:21.360
I don't count.

07:48:21.360 --> 07:48:22.360
Oh, rush.

07:48:23.360 --> 07:48:24.360
What was an enemy back here?

07:48:24.360 --> 07:48:25.360
What was it?

07:48:25.360 --> 07:48:26.360
Oh, right, you.

07:48:26.360 --> 07:48:27.360
Right, you're three of ten.

07:48:27.360 --> 07:48:29.360
Thank you very much.

07:48:31.360 --> 07:48:32.360
Appreciate it.

07:48:33.360 --> 07:48:36.360
Actually, I'm going to go for these guys because they're just easy.

07:48:39.360 --> 07:48:40.360
Oh, pardon me.

07:48:40.360 --> 07:48:42.360
I'm just calling the assassins in.

07:48:43.360 --> 07:48:44.360
No, stop running away.

07:48:44.360 --> 07:48:46.360
I know it's scary when I start.

07:48:46.360 --> 07:48:49.360
Oh, hijack, thank you very much.

07:48:50.360 --> 07:48:54.360
Wait, if he keeps going on horses, can I just farm him?

07:48:54.360 --> 07:48:55.360
Farm him?

07:49:00.360 --> 07:49:02.360
Oh, no, my assassins are going to get up.

07:49:02.360 --> 07:49:04.360
Okay, I have learned.

07:49:05.360 --> 07:49:06.360
Today I have learned.

07:49:06.360 --> 07:49:07.360
Let me get this guy here.

07:49:09.360 --> 07:49:12.360
I think I can just farm him over and over again.

07:49:12.360 --> 07:49:17.360
And because I jump off my horse to do it, he jumps on main automatically.

07:49:17.360 --> 07:49:20.360
Right, what, what was that, like five?

07:49:21.360 --> 07:49:23.360
So he's going to get on the horse.

07:49:24.360 --> 07:49:25.360
Six.

07:49:27.360 --> 07:49:28.360
Okay.

07:49:31.360 --> 07:49:33.360
Oh, my goodness.

07:49:33.360 --> 07:49:38.360
Seven grand theft dressage, but I didn't get the thing yet.

07:49:39.360 --> 07:49:41.360
That's funny as anything though.

07:49:42.360 --> 07:49:43.360
Oh, my God.

07:49:43.360 --> 07:49:45.360
This is actually really funny.

07:49:45.360 --> 07:49:47.360
Eight, I think eight.

07:49:49.360 --> 07:49:51.360
Nine.

07:49:52.360 --> 07:49:54.360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

07:49:54.360 --> 07:49:55.360
Hey, there we go.

07:49:55.360 --> 07:49:56.360
There we go.

07:49:56.360 --> 07:49:57.360
Beautiful, beautiful.

07:50:01.360 --> 07:50:04.360
Right, a few more kills from horseback.

07:50:04.360 --> 07:50:05.360
That was good.

07:50:05.360 --> 07:50:08.360
All he wants to do is ride the horse on his horse.

07:50:08.360 --> 07:50:10.360
I just kept yanking over and over again.

07:50:11.360 --> 07:50:15.360
I mean, did he really want the horse if he just made it that easy for me?

07:50:16.360 --> 07:50:18.360
Okay, we're at the bath house.

07:50:18.360 --> 07:50:20.360
I recognize this part of the map.

07:50:22.360 --> 07:50:25.360
I think we're going to have to go in a bit more to find more guards.

07:50:25.360 --> 07:50:27.360
I'm literally just going on the outskirts there.

07:50:27.360 --> 07:50:28.360
On the map.

07:50:30.360 --> 07:50:36.360
A few more assassinations from a horse while on horseback.

07:50:37.360 --> 07:50:38.360
Well on horseback?

07:50:38.360 --> 07:50:40.360
Oh, no, hold on, let me check.

07:50:41.360 --> 07:50:42.360
Very quickly.

07:50:45.360 --> 07:50:47.360
Stoney has DNA, DNA.

07:50:48.360 --> 07:50:50.360
Is this the horse one?

07:50:50.360 --> 07:50:53.360
Guards on horseback, air assassinate.

07:50:53.360 --> 07:50:55.360
Guards killed while on horse.

07:50:55.360 --> 07:50:56.360
While on horseback.

07:50:56.360 --> 07:51:02.360
Okay, I'm going to get my crossbow out and we're literally just going on a spree then.

07:51:03.360 --> 07:51:05.360
I need to stay on horseback now.

07:51:07.360 --> 07:51:08.360
Oh, I'm going the wrong way.

07:51:08.360 --> 07:51:15.360
I need to go to the wards, the Colosseum, which is this way.

07:51:15.360 --> 07:51:16.360
What's that?

07:51:16.360 --> 07:51:19.360
You've played assassins, creeds so much that you recognize which way you need to go.

07:51:19.360 --> 07:51:21.360
Maybe, maybe not.

07:51:23.360 --> 07:51:25.360
There should be four enemies here.

07:51:27.360 --> 07:51:29.360
I'm surprised how casual this is.

07:51:35.360 --> 07:51:37.360
Don't peel me off, don't peel me off, I'm scared.

07:51:37.360 --> 07:51:39.360
Stop, you're scaring me.

07:51:40.360 --> 07:51:41.360
That's four.

07:51:42.360 --> 07:51:43.360
Okay, there we go.

07:51:46.360 --> 07:51:49.360
Oh, wait.

07:51:50.360 --> 07:51:52.360
We need to do the beam trick.

07:51:52.360 --> 07:51:53.360
I think this is the beam trick.

07:51:54.360 --> 07:51:55.360
That was the beam trick.

07:51:55.360 --> 07:51:57.360
Right, we need to do that 19 more times.

07:51:57.360 --> 07:51:58.360
I'm not even kidding.

07:51:58.360 --> 07:52:00.360
Hold on, and we need to lure the guards.

07:52:00.360 --> 07:52:02.360
Come here, come, come, come.

07:52:03.360 --> 07:52:04.360
Lure these men away.

07:52:06.360 --> 07:52:07.360
No, lure them away?

07:52:07.360 --> 07:52:08.360
Yeah, there you go.

07:52:09.360 --> 07:52:16.360
Right, we basically need to go back and forth over and over, jumping on this beam.

07:52:17.360 --> 07:52:19.360
No, you didn't do it, it's you.

07:52:19.360 --> 07:52:21.360
That wasn't it, that wasn't the trick.

07:52:21.360 --> 07:52:26.360
We needed to do that flip you saw, literally 19 times more.

07:52:26.360 --> 07:52:28.360
Do a flip, it's you.

07:52:28.360 --> 07:52:31.360
Right, and I want to...

07:52:31.360 --> 07:52:33.360
No, it's you, try again.

07:52:34.360 --> 07:52:37.360
Do I need to jump on a specific part?

07:52:38.360 --> 07:52:39.360
Really specific.

07:52:43.360 --> 07:52:46.360
Jump, hold, flip.

07:52:46.360 --> 07:52:48.360
Okay, jump, hold, flip.

07:52:49.360 --> 07:52:51.360
So I need to tap A and then hold it.

07:52:51.360 --> 07:52:52.360
So 18 more times.

07:52:55.360 --> 07:52:57.360
Jump, hold, no.

07:52:57.360 --> 07:52:59.360
Okay, I think we needed a bit more speed that time.

07:52:59.360 --> 07:53:02.360
Give us a bit more energy, a bit more energy.

07:53:02.360 --> 07:53:05.360
Little bull's eye, a little horsey-worsey.

07:53:06.360 --> 07:53:08.360
Do a bit of run-up for it, hold.

07:53:09.360 --> 07:53:13.360
And that horse just blocked us and jump and hold.

07:53:13.360 --> 07:53:15.360
Why did that not work that time?

07:53:17.360 --> 07:53:19.360
I'm not sure why that didn't work.

07:53:22.360 --> 07:53:24.360
Yeah, but while talking with those, it's not bad.

07:53:25.360 --> 07:53:27.360
I'm doing it in the corner of my eye.

07:53:27.360 --> 07:53:29.360
And jump.

07:53:29.360 --> 07:53:33.360
Okay, I purposely did that a bit later than when I would have selected A.

07:53:33.360 --> 07:53:36.360
So it's 17 more.

07:53:37.360 --> 07:53:39.360
I can do it.

07:53:39.360 --> 07:53:41.360
Bitly, hold.

07:53:41.360 --> 07:53:43.360
No, okay, right.

07:53:45.360 --> 07:53:47.360
You're gonna have to bear with me, bear with me.

07:53:47.360 --> 07:53:51.360
A is in this room right now because you're gonna have to bear with me.

07:53:51.360 --> 07:53:54.360
Bear with me, let me take a few seconds.

07:53:55.360 --> 07:53:58.360
Ready, steady, jump and hold.

07:53:58.360 --> 07:54:01.360
Yay, 16 more times, let's go.

07:54:02.360 --> 07:54:05.360
I definitely seem to be able to do it coming from that way.

07:54:05.360 --> 07:54:07.360
I'm wondering if I can't do it this way.

07:54:07.360 --> 07:54:09.360
Maybe there's like a hidden bug.

07:54:09.360 --> 07:54:11.360
And a jump and a hold.

07:54:13.360 --> 07:54:15.360
Maybe it's a one-way type of thing.

07:54:17.360 --> 07:54:19.360
We're getting there.

07:54:19.360 --> 07:54:21.360
70 more, let's go, literally.

07:54:21.360 --> 07:54:23.360
It's like, oh, I'm so glad you guys put this.

07:54:23.360 --> 07:54:25.360
Really arbitrary.

07:54:25.360 --> 07:54:29.360
Okay, really, really premature with that one.

07:54:29.360 --> 07:54:31.360
I'm not even gonna, no, no.

07:54:31.360 --> 07:54:33.360
The horse.

07:54:35.360 --> 07:54:37.360
Let's try that again.

07:54:39.360 --> 07:54:42.360
I wish the NPCs would actually calm down about my rely.

07:54:42.360 --> 07:54:44.360
Hold, no.

07:54:46.360 --> 07:54:49.360
I honestly, I'm not sure how I'm getting it sometimes

07:54:49.360 --> 07:54:51.360
and not other times.

07:54:51.360 --> 07:54:55.360
My only guess is that an NPC is making it so like

07:54:55.360 --> 07:54:57.360
this pathing mess up.

07:54:57.360 --> 07:54:59.360
Jump, hold.

07:54:59.360 --> 07:55:01.360
No, why?

07:55:01.360 --> 07:55:03.360
What is going on?

07:55:03.360 --> 07:55:05.360
What is going on?

07:55:05.360 --> 07:55:07.360
I'm not actually sure why sometimes I'm getting that.

07:55:07.360 --> 07:55:09.360
Right, we'll do a really big run up just because we can.

07:55:11.360 --> 07:55:14.360
Okay, so run and then stand.

07:55:14.360 --> 07:55:16.360
And then jump and hold.

07:55:16.360 --> 07:55:18.360
Okay, okay, it's speed.

07:55:18.360 --> 07:55:20.360
It's speed. We need a bigger run up.

07:55:20.360 --> 07:55:22.360
15 more times.

07:55:22.360 --> 07:55:24.360
15 more times.

07:55:24.360 --> 07:55:27.360
Okay, big, big long journey.

07:55:27.360 --> 07:55:29.360
One, two, three, four, five.

07:55:29.360 --> 07:55:31.360
Jump and hold.

07:55:33.360 --> 07:55:35.360
15 is still the number.

07:55:35.360 --> 07:55:36.360
We can't do it.

07:55:36.360 --> 07:55:39.360
This is not at all.

07:55:39.360 --> 07:55:41.360
A bit of a grind.

07:55:41.360 --> 07:55:43.360
A bit more of a grind than I was expecting.

07:55:43.360 --> 07:55:45.360
Run.

07:55:45.360 --> 07:55:47.360
Jump and hold.

07:55:50.360 --> 07:55:53.360
I honestly don't understand what's determining

07:55:53.360 --> 07:55:55.360
the number.

07:55:55.360 --> 07:55:57.360
Maybe do the middle one.

07:55:57.360 --> 07:55:59.360
Like jump late.

07:55:59.360 --> 07:56:01.360
I think you may be right.

07:56:01.360 --> 07:56:03.360
We'll jump late on purpose this time.

07:56:03.360 --> 07:56:05.360
Okay.

07:56:05.360 --> 07:56:07.360
Not doing it.

07:56:07.360 --> 07:56:09.360
Not doing it.

07:56:09.360 --> 07:56:11.360
We'll jump now and hold.

07:56:11.360 --> 07:56:13.360
No.

07:56:13.360 --> 07:56:15.360
Thank you for at least coming back.

07:56:15.360 --> 07:56:17.360
Hmm.

07:56:17.360 --> 07:56:19.360
15 is better than 20.

07:56:19.360 --> 07:56:21.360
And 14 is better than 15.

07:56:21.360 --> 07:56:23.360
Whoa.

07:56:23.360 --> 07:56:25.360
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:56:25.360 --> 07:56:27.360
No.

07:56:27.360 --> 07:56:29.360
No.

07:56:29.360 --> 07:56:31.360
No.

07:56:31.360 --> 07:56:33.360
No.

07:56:33.360 --> 07:56:35.360
Is the appropriate response

07:56:35.360 --> 07:56:37.360
after seeing that out loud?

07:56:39.360 --> 07:56:41.360
Oh, right.

07:56:41.360 --> 07:56:43.360
No, that didn't work.

07:56:43.360 --> 07:56:45.360
I think I'm getting speed blocked or something.

07:56:45.360 --> 07:56:47.360
Because this is...

07:56:47.360 --> 07:56:49.360
What?

07:56:49.360 --> 07:56:51.360
What?

07:56:51.360 --> 07:56:53.360
13.

07:56:53.360 --> 07:56:55.360
No, not 13.

07:56:55.360 --> 07:56:57.360
Close to 13.

07:56:57.360 --> 07:56:59.360
We can do it.

07:56:59.360 --> 07:57:01.360
I literally feel like Bilbo Baggins when he's like...

07:57:01.360 --> 07:57:03.360
He's like trying not to be like a bit

07:57:03.360 --> 07:57:05.360
disgruntled with like

07:57:05.360 --> 07:57:07.360
the dwarves showing up.

07:57:07.360 --> 07:57:09.360
And I'm like, ooh, ooh, it's fine.

07:57:09.360 --> 07:57:11.360
It's fine.

07:57:11.360 --> 07:57:13.360
No.

07:57:13.360 --> 07:57:15.360
This is very pun.

07:57:15.360 --> 07:57:17.360
There is a war going on.

07:57:18.360 --> 07:57:20.360
Maybe you have to be under the beams.

07:57:20.360 --> 07:57:22.360
Okay, I'll definitely...

07:57:22.360 --> 07:57:24.360
Like, I'll super delay it this time.

07:57:24.360 --> 07:57:26.360
Like, genuinely super delay it.

07:57:28.360 --> 07:57:30.360
No, he just jumped straight on it.

07:57:30.360 --> 07:57:32.360
If you do it, like, super delayed.

07:57:32.360 --> 07:57:34.360
Okay.

07:57:34.360 --> 07:57:36.360
Hmm.

07:57:36.360 --> 07:57:38.360
Curious, curious, right?

07:57:38.360 --> 07:57:40.360
I'll try again.

07:57:40.360 --> 07:57:42.360
Because 14...

07:57:43.360 --> 07:57:45.360
Like, I can do this, honestly.

07:57:45.360 --> 07:57:47.360
It's just so...

07:57:47.360 --> 07:57:49.360
I'm trying to avoid that guy.

07:57:49.360 --> 07:57:51.360
I'll try to avoid that guy.

07:57:51.360 --> 07:57:53.360
I think I just need to let the horse

07:57:53.360 --> 07:57:55.360
maybe directly steer,

07:57:55.360 --> 07:57:57.360
even if the horse is a little off.

07:57:57.360 --> 07:57:59.360
Because the steering...

07:57:59.360 --> 07:58:01.360
As soon as I stand on the horse's saddle,

07:58:01.360 --> 07:58:03.360
the steering...

07:58:04.360 --> 07:58:06.360
Oh.

07:58:06.360 --> 07:58:08.360
What is it? I don't know.

07:58:08.360 --> 07:58:10.360
So, I just realized since you're in Australia,

07:58:10.360 --> 07:58:12.360
does that mean you've been streaming since 3am?

07:58:12.360 --> 07:58:14.360
4am is my stream time.

07:58:14.360 --> 07:58:16.360
Daylight saving and stuff.

07:58:17.360 --> 07:58:19.360
But it's healthy...

07:58:19.360 --> 07:58:21.360
It's healthy.

07:58:21.360 --> 07:58:23.360
It means I can do stuff during the day.

07:58:23.360 --> 07:58:25.360
Oh, 13, 13!

07:58:25.360 --> 07:58:27.360
Okay, I don't know.

07:58:27.360 --> 07:58:29.360
I genuinely didn't do anything different.

07:58:29.360 --> 07:58:31.360
I think it really is just luck of the draw or something,

07:58:31.360 --> 07:58:33.360
because I did not do anything...

07:58:35.360 --> 07:58:37.360
Ah, I thought I was going to say, hopefully,

07:58:37.360 --> 07:58:39.360
I'm going to get two in a row.

07:58:40.360 --> 07:58:42.360
This is such a bizarre,

07:58:42.360 --> 07:58:43.360
like,

07:58:43.360 --> 07:58:45.360
challenge-type thing, honestly.

07:58:50.360 --> 07:58:51.360
No!

07:58:51.360 --> 07:58:53.360
Why, why, why, why?

07:58:53.360 --> 07:58:54.360
30!

07:58:54.360 --> 07:58:55.360
No, not 30!

07:58:55.360 --> 07:58:56.360
13!

07:58:56.360 --> 07:58:57.360
13!

07:58:58.360 --> 07:58:59.360
Mmm.

07:58:59.360 --> 07:59:00.360
Spreads build up just straight up and...

07:59:00.360 --> 07:59:01.360
Ah!

07:59:02.360 --> 07:59:04.360
All bits are so, like...

07:59:05.360 --> 07:59:06.360
Neaxanoid in the moment.

07:59:06.360 --> 07:59:08.360
See, yeah, that was, like, hardly any build up to it,

07:59:08.360 --> 07:59:10.360
so I think that's why that one's on the wall.

07:59:13.360 --> 07:59:14.360
Mmm.

07:59:15.360 --> 07:59:17.360
Let's not be knocking down women.

07:59:17.360 --> 07:59:19.360
I only want to knock up women.

07:59:19.360 --> 07:59:20.360
Thank you very much.

07:59:21.360 --> 07:59:22.360
Oh, wait!

07:59:22.360 --> 07:59:23.360
I don't want to knock down women.

07:59:23.360 --> 07:59:25.360
I only want to knock them up!

07:59:26.360 --> 07:59:27.360
Please laugh.

07:59:32.360 --> 07:59:34.360
One more time without doing a massive thing.

07:59:40.360 --> 07:59:41.360
I have a little thingy.

07:59:41.360 --> 07:59:42.360
Yeah, I forgot.

07:59:42.360 --> 07:59:44.360
I forgot I had it too.

07:59:44.360 --> 07:59:45.360
Okay, I forgot.

07:59:45.360 --> 07:59:47.360
Literally, I'll need to add a laughing track as well.

07:59:47.360 --> 07:59:50.360
Oh, brother, this guy stinks!

07:59:50.360 --> 07:59:53.360
Yeah, I'm going to have to add a...

07:59:54.360 --> 07:59:55.360
I'll add a laughing track.

07:59:55.360 --> 07:59:57.360
I should add a laughing track.

07:59:57.360 --> 07:59:58.360
That's, like, one that's good,

07:59:58.360 --> 08:00:00.360
and then one that's, like,

08:00:00.360 --> 08:00:02.360
it gets a few coughs and, like, a giggle,

08:00:02.360 --> 08:00:03.360
so it's, like, a bad joke.

08:00:03.360 --> 08:00:05.360
I'm definitely going to need to get that.

08:00:08.360 --> 08:00:09.360
I need to hydrate.

08:00:09.360 --> 08:00:10.360
My goodness.

08:00:10.360 --> 08:00:12.360
Trying so hard to figure out, like,

08:00:12.360 --> 08:00:14.360
what's determined in this jump or not?

08:00:16.360 --> 08:00:18.360
I need some crickets, yeah.

08:00:20.360 --> 08:00:21.360
Do the joke again.

08:00:21.360 --> 08:00:23.360
I let my laugh in my other jacket.

08:00:24.360 --> 08:00:26.360
Oh, you left your laugh in the other jacket.

08:00:26.360 --> 08:00:28.360
Ha-ha, you spelt it wrong.

08:00:28.360 --> 08:00:29.360
Everyone pointing laugh.

08:00:29.360 --> 08:00:30.360
You spelt his thing wrong,

08:00:30.360 --> 08:00:31.360
and I read it out,

08:00:31.360 --> 08:00:32.360
and now he's embarrassed.

08:00:32.360 --> 08:00:34.360
Ha-ha-ha, streamer,

08:00:34.360 --> 08:00:36.360
read out your message with a spelling error.

08:00:36.360 --> 08:00:37.360
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

08:00:37.360 --> 08:00:39.360
Oh, that was just gross.

08:00:40.360 --> 08:00:42.360
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

08:00:43.360 --> 08:00:45.360
Right, okay, we're going to try Gallop now.

08:00:46.360 --> 08:00:48.360
The only issue with Gallop in

08:00:48.360 --> 08:00:50.360
is if you Gallop through a crowd too much.

08:00:53.360 --> 08:00:54.360
No, that was far too early.

08:00:54.360 --> 08:00:56.360
Okay, I kind of struggled with this.

08:00:56.360 --> 08:00:58.360
We'll try the Gallop from this side.

08:00:59.360 --> 08:01:00.360
Life's over.

08:01:00.360 --> 08:01:01.360
It's over.

08:01:01.360 --> 08:01:02.360
You'll never recover.

08:01:02.360 --> 08:01:05.360
Your social credit has been determined.

08:01:05.360 --> 08:01:06.360
No, okay.

08:01:06.360 --> 08:01:09.360
That Gallop doesn't seem to enable that jump whatsoever.

08:01:09.360 --> 08:01:11.360
I like how the horse is so responsive.

08:01:11.360 --> 08:01:12.360
It's like, where'd you go?

08:01:12.360 --> 08:01:13.360
Please come back.

08:01:15.360 --> 08:01:18.360
Oh, is it the degration?

08:01:18.360 --> 08:01:19.360
Degoration.

08:01:19.360 --> 08:01:20.360
Degredation?

08:01:20.360 --> 08:01:21.360
Degredation.

08:01:21.360 --> 08:01:22.360
Degredation.

08:01:22.360 --> 08:01:24.360
Degredation sounds correct.

08:01:24.360 --> 08:01:26.360
I said a degredation.

08:01:26.360 --> 08:01:27.360
Ooh, 12!

08:01:29.360 --> 08:01:31.360
I'm just so surprised when it does happen.

08:01:31.360 --> 08:01:33.360
It seems to happen in that direction

08:01:33.360 --> 08:01:35.360
more than it happens in this direction.

08:01:36.360 --> 08:01:37.360
Nope.

08:01:37.360 --> 08:01:38.360
Well, close.

08:01:38.360 --> 08:01:39.360
It's over.

08:01:39.360 --> 08:01:40.360
Not quite.

08:01:41.360 --> 08:01:42.360
I do want you on the beams,

08:01:42.360 --> 08:01:43.360
but I want you to do that

08:01:43.360 --> 08:01:45.360
with fancy flips that you do.

08:01:45.360 --> 08:01:46.360
They should have made it 10.

08:01:46.360 --> 08:01:48.360
No, they actually shouldn't have done this at all

08:01:48.360 --> 08:01:50.360
because literally, how would you have discovered that

08:01:50.360 --> 08:01:51.360
Exo can even do this?

08:01:51.360 --> 08:01:53.360
I'm sorry, but I would never have naturally discovered

08:01:53.360 --> 08:01:54.360
that he could do this.

08:01:56.360 --> 08:01:57.360
Good night.

08:01:57.360 --> 08:01:58.360
Rest well.

08:01:58.360 --> 08:01:59.360
Thank you for hanging.

08:02:00.360 --> 08:02:01.360
We're, uh...

08:02:02.360 --> 08:02:04.360
Oh, I actually can't see how long I've been streaming for.

08:02:04.360 --> 08:02:05.360
I've accidentally covered it up

08:02:05.360 --> 08:02:08.360
by a little list of things that I need to do.

08:02:08.360 --> 08:02:09.360
Oopsie, oopsie.

08:02:10.360 --> 08:02:11.360
Oh, that was like...

08:02:11.360 --> 08:02:12.360
Really?

08:02:12.360 --> 08:02:13.360
Nope.

08:02:16.360 --> 08:02:19.360
It feels like it has cooled down, honestly.

08:02:19.360 --> 08:02:20.360
The brain rot took over.

08:02:20.360 --> 08:02:21.360
Yeah, it took over long ago.

08:02:21.360 --> 08:02:22.360
I apologize.

08:02:23.360 --> 08:02:24.360
Eight hours.

08:02:24.360 --> 08:02:25.360
I've only been streaming eight hours,

08:02:25.360 --> 08:02:26.360
and I've got a few more in me.

08:02:28.360 --> 08:02:29.360
I want this one over

08:02:29.360 --> 08:02:31.360
because I never want to have to do it again.

08:02:32.360 --> 08:02:34.360
I don't want to have to come back to this,

08:02:34.360 --> 08:02:36.360
but I know you guys have been literally watching me

08:02:36.360 --> 08:02:37.360
do a backflip on...

08:02:37.360 --> 08:02:39.360
Do a flip on a horse for like ten minutes now.

08:02:39.360 --> 08:02:40.360
It's gonna be just...

08:02:40.360 --> 08:02:41.360
No one's laughing.

08:02:43.360 --> 08:02:44.360
Getting aggravated now.

08:02:44.360 --> 08:02:45.360
Great.

08:02:45.360 --> 08:02:46.360
I am running.

08:02:46.360 --> 08:02:47.360
I am running.

08:02:47.360 --> 08:02:48.360
I am holding.

08:02:48.360 --> 08:02:49.360
Oh!

08:02:49.360 --> 08:02:50.360
Hmm.

08:02:51.360 --> 08:02:52.360
Eleven?

08:02:54.360 --> 08:02:56.360
Okay, I think it's eleven now.

08:02:56.360 --> 08:02:57.360
I don't know why.

08:02:57.360 --> 08:03:00.360
Right, I'll run up for ages.

08:03:00.360 --> 08:03:01.360
Hold.

08:03:01.360 --> 08:03:02.360
Nope.

08:03:05.360 --> 08:03:07.360
Oh, we're almost 50% of the way there.

08:03:07.360 --> 08:03:09.360
We're almost there.

08:03:10.360 --> 08:03:11.360
No flip.

08:03:11.360 --> 08:03:12.360
Absolutely.

08:03:12.360 --> 08:03:14.360
Only eight hours.

08:03:14.360 --> 08:03:16.360
Oh, well, you guys are gonna feel at a place

08:03:16.360 --> 08:03:19.360
when you see me only online for like two hours tomorrow.

08:03:19.360 --> 08:03:20.360
You're gonna be like,

08:03:20.360 --> 08:03:21.360
what's wrong?

08:03:21.360 --> 08:03:22.360
Is she sick?

08:03:22.360 --> 08:03:23.360
Where's my horse?

08:03:24.360 --> 08:03:25.360
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:03:26.360 --> 08:03:28.360
Oh no, you have done.

08:03:34.360 --> 08:03:35.360
Ten, ten.

08:03:35.360 --> 08:03:37.360
Right, I feel like it always happens

08:03:37.360 --> 08:03:38.360
come in this direction

08:03:38.360 --> 08:03:40.360
instead of the other direction.

08:03:41.360 --> 08:03:42.360
Skillshare can't even do a flip.

08:03:42.360 --> 08:03:44.360
We're not flipping out on you.

08:03:44.360 --> 08:03:46.360
You're not flipping out on me?

08:03:49.360 --> 08:03:50.360
Insert laugh track here

08:03:50.360 --> 08:03:51.360
that I still haven't added yet,

08:03:51.360 --> 08:03:53.360
but I will add the laugh track soon to you.

08:03:54.360 --> 08:03:56.360
Please get the heck out of my way.

08:03:56.360 --> 08:03:57.360
I'm trying to do flips.

08:04:05.360 --> 08:04:07.360
Can you leave me alone?

08:04:08.360 --> 08:04:09.360
No.

08:04:12.360 --> 08:04:14.360
No money is worth this, he said.

08:04:16.360 --> 08:04:18.360
I do need to kill from horseback.

08:04:19.360 --> 08:04:21.360
So maybe just do that real quick.

08:04:25.360 --> 08:04:26.360
We'll just do this one

08:04:26.360 --> 08:04:27.360
to add to the horseback one.

08:04:27.360 --> 08:04:28.360
So we're still making progress

08:04:28.360 --> 08:04:30.360
even though it's very good.

08:04:31.360 --> 08:04:32.360
Let's try this.

08:04:34.360 --> 08:04:35.360
I did it!

08:04:41.360 --> 08:04:42.360
Okay, that's the sound

08:04:42.360 --> 08:04:44.360
I need to add right now.

08:04:45.360 --> 08:04:47.360
But if I do the flip, it goes ehhhhh.

08:04:48.360 --> 08:04:49.360
Don't worry,

08:04:49.360 --> 08:04:50.360
I'll get a little bit for you.

08:04:50.360 --> 08:04:51.360
I'm dead.

08:04:56.360 --> 08:04:57.360
Flipping on a beam off a hole

08:04:57.360 --> 08:04:59.360
or is this sucks

08:04:59.360 --> 08:05:00.360
and I don't know

08:05:00.360 --> 08:05:02.360
why they asked for a twin.

08:05:04.360 --> 08:05:08.360
stop taking people's horses.

08:05:08.360 --> 08:05:12.360
It's really not nice.

08:05:12.360 --> 08:05:16.360
I'm looking to see if there's like a

08:05:16.360 --> 08:05:20.360
prompt that's like double tap to do a beam or jump or whatever

08:05:20.360 --> 08:05:24.360
but there's no happening.

08:05:24.360 --> 08:05:28.360
There's no happening but we're halfway there. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it. We can do it.

08:05:28.360 --> 08:05:32.360
Well, that's probably not going to work now.

08:05:32.360 --> 08:05:36.360
I have lost my mind.

08:05:36.360 --> 08:05:40.360
Literally I've been doing flips for so long. Please.

08:05:40.360 --> 08:05:44.360
Free me. Free me from the beam.

08:05:44.360 --> 08:05:48.360
Oh, nine. Finally.

08:05:48.360 --> 08:05:52.360
Wow.

08:05:56.360 --> 08:06:00.360
No, it's still below the beam.

08:06:00.360 --> 08:06:04.360
You could have easily sat back on the horse, I'll be honest.

08:06:04.360 --> 08:06:08.360
The skirt looks so funny. You mean has killed.

08:06:08.360 --> 08:06:12.360
He's killed to kill to pull fun.

08:06:12.360 --> 08:06:16.360
Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Okay, that was

08:06:16.360 --> 08:06:20.360
excuse me. I think I need it. I think I can kill him

08:06:20.360 --> 08:06:24.360
and it'll count for the horseback.

08:06:24.360 --> 08:06:28.360
Oh, I'm getting a spank. I'm getting a spank. I'm sorry.

08:06:28.360 --> 08:06:32.360
Actually, I should probably do these guys from horseback as well.

08:06:32.360 --> 08:06:36.360
There we go. One.

08:06:36.360 --> 08:06:40.360
Two.

08:06:40.360 --> 08:06:44.360
Three. Or I'm going to throw rocks through

08:06:44.360 --> 08:06:48.360
your window.

08:06:48.360 --> 08:06:52.360
Okay, let's try this again. Oh, no, don't jump.

08:06:52.360 --> 08:06:56.360
No, stay. Try again. Try again.

08:06:56.360 --> 08:07:00.360
You mustn't offend the left.

08:07:00.360 --> 08:07:04.360
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry, can you? Oh, seven.

08:07:04.360 --> 08:07:08.360
Seven? I think seven.

08:07:08.360 --> 08:07:12.360
I still have yet to

08:07:12.360 --> 08:07:16.360
figure out what determines it, but once it's over with, we don't have to do it again.

08:07:16.360 --> 08:07:20.360
We got a double. We got a double. We got a double. Oh my god, I've not done that.

08:07:20.360 --> 08:07:24.360
Can we do a triple? Can we do a triple? It's like my subconscious understanding

08:07:24.360 --> 08:07:28.360
what I need to do, even though my brain, like, my actual conscious doesn't...

08:07:28.360 --> 08:07:32.360
No, we got a double though. So it's six.

08:07:32.360 --> 08:07:36.360
Only six more to go. I've never done back to back. That's fantastic.

08:07:36.360 --> 08:07:40.360
I was literally like, is my subconscious knowing what's up? But my conscious

08:07:40.360 --> 08:07:44.360
is like, can't... mmm, that was far too early.

08:07:44.360 --> 08:07:48.360
I need to put my glicks on for that one. That's terrible.

08:07:48.360 --> 08:07:52.360
Wow. Oh, baby.

08:07:54.360 --> 08:07:58.360
Top 10 moments of 24.

08:07:58.360 --> 08:08:02.360
Welcome to WatchMojo. Well, we rate the

08:08:02.360 --> 08:08:06.360
worst little

08:08:06.360 --> 08:08:10.360
side quest things that Assassin's Creed Brotherhood randomly give you, because it is a bit

08:08:10.360 --> 08:08:14.360
arbitrary.

08:08:14.360 --> 08:08:18.360
Yeah.

08:08:18.360 --> 08:08:22.360
Only six

08:08:22.360 --> 08:08:26.360
more. Can you hold on?

08:08:26.360 --> 08:08:30.360
I'm starting to lose

08:08:30.360 --> 08:08:34.360
a little bit, but that's okay, because we got five. We got five.

08:08:34.360 --> 08:08:38.360
I was going to say it would be a triple. Get out of my

08:08:38.360 --> 08:08:42.360
hand. Look, I wasn't kidding when people were like, why would you

08:08:42.360 --> 08:08:46.360
describe Shubi as like, everything you should have been?

08:08:46.360 --> 08:08:50.360
I wasn't kidding. Was I kidding?

08:08:50.360 --> 08:08:54.360
Oh, four! Four! Four!

08:08:54.360 --> 08:08:58.360
Cheat run.

08:08:58.360 --> 08:09:02.360
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f...

08:09:02.360 --> 08:09:06.360
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f...

08:09:06.360 --> 08:09:10.360
F-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f

08:09:10.360 --> 08:09:18.360
Wow, four, that was too slow.

08:09:18.360 --> 08:09:24.360
We're sounding so country.

08:09:24.360 --> 08:09:31.360
Wow, the sound of the ice cream.

08:09:32.360 --> 08:09:38.360
Three, three, three, three,

08:09:38.360 --> 08:09:48.360
three, two, two, two, two,

08:09:48.360 --> 08:09:52.360
two, two, two...

08:09:52.360 --> 08:09:54.360
All the two, two, two,

08:09:54.360 --> 08:09:56.360
all the two, two,

08:09:56.360 --> 08:09:59.360
all of that was gonna get the Truffle there.

08:09:59.360 --> 08:10:07.200
Two more. Two more. The people listening in right now that are like waiting on

08:10:07.200 --> 08:10:12.560
Mercy to start they're like please for the love of God mercy start early.

08:10:15.840 --> 08:10:25.840
One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. Just one more time.

08:10:26.640 --> 08:10:32.320
We've got to celebrate. Oh yeah jumping on the horse beam.

08:10:35.440 --> 08:10:42.640
Do the random say thing for the guilt quiz because it's so silly. Just one more time.

08:10:43.600 --> 08:10:47.120
We've got to celebrate. Oh yeah.

08:10:48.080 --> 08:10:57.360
Oh don't don't ever be such a silly sausage again and

08:11:00.960 --> 08:11:06.800
your daddy your dad tells everyone don't ever give me such a silly thing again.

08:11:06.800 --> 08:11:13.600
That was absolute torture. Lower guards leap of faith guards air assassinate from a beam.

08:11:14.160 --> 08:11:15.840
No guards.

08:11:20.080 --> 08:11:24.320
Okay the only thing I can think of doing is attracting these guards over here to

08:11:24.320 --> 08:11:32.400
no because they would have to be below me. Where is a beam that a rider goes past because I think

08:11:32.400 --> 08:11:36.720
that's what I have to assassinate. It's enough horsing around. No dive on.

08:11:37.120 --> 08:11:42.880
I think if I do this I might get the horseback kills.

08:11:58.000 --> 08:12:01.600
Uh uh please come under this beam over here please harass me under this beam please

08:12:01.600 --> 08:12:04.800
harass me under this beam I can't believe the game literally just trained me for this moment

08:12:04.800 --> 08:12:08.320
please come under the beam please come under the beam I take all back I'm sorry these guilt

08:12:14.000 --> 08:12:22.960
these skills I'm sorry these skills I'm sorry I didn't believe you these skills I didn't believe

08:12:22.960 --> 08:12:33.840
you I'm sorry where the heck is this mystical beam that the enemies pass under I don't know where

08:12:33.920 --> 08:12:37.760
it's located it's not up here it doesn't feel like it's up here at all

08:12:41.120 --> 08:12:45.920
ah mission failed you get I'm next time literally where the heck are these beams

08:12:47.280 --> 08:12:52.960
are there any beams anywhere the only beam around here is me having a beamer because

08:12:52.960 --> 08:13:01.280
of how freaking embarrassed in this gameplay is to have a beamer means that you are embarrassed

08:13:01.280 --> 08:13:04.000
and have scarlet face or a red face

08:13:04.000 --> 08:13:22.720
um

08:13:23.440 --> 08:13:24.720
um

08:13:25.760 --> 08:13:26.320
just to be like

08:13:27.280 --> 08:13:35.920
uh levope does have missions I am going to buy ammo and I'm going to do this stationary guy

08:13:35.920 --> 08:13:42.880
one because it's really easy to do it in this quest so I'm going to go buy ammo and we're going

08:13:42.880 --> 08:13:48.400
to replay a mission that gives us one of the thieves guilds requirements

08:13:48.400 --> 08:13:58.560
yeah Claudio yeah she does as well um I'm trying to do sorry who goes there um

08:14:01.520 --> 08:14:05.120
oh goodness me I think I'm actually gonna have to get rid of my rating from a very

08:14:13.600 --> 08:14:18.000
what is needy smear overload it is uh unfortunately I actually don't

08:14:18.080 --> 08:14:21.680
know too much about the game but it might be a good thing because we get to play for fun for the

08:14:21.680 --> 08:14:25.760
first time um I don't think it's gonna be a very long stream if you're wanting an endurance on that

08:14:26.880 --> 08:14:34.560
I need to go to the shops to buy the sweets for the hand cam swing stream why am I here just to

08:14:34.560 --> 08:14:44.320
suffer yeah sure how much was that oh you're no cheat oh I need to buy art I just realized that

08:14:44.320 --> 08:14:50.080
yeah I need to buy like tons of art in all the different districts two three hours yeah that's

08:14:50.080 --> 08:14:56.720
like the perfect stream deep gargling didn't overstay as well but uh okay okay I do it

08:14:58.080 --> 08:15:00.240
young man with an apple man

08:15:03.040 --> 08:15:07.520
he looks so dumb he's like I have an apple posing oh that's a cool one

08:15:07.520 --> 08:15:20.240
hmm right we've got all the art for here oh wait I'm like 90% sure you sell feather locations

08:15:20.240 --> 08:15:27.440
can you please resell me then no yeah the feathers we'll grab the feather I'm another

08:15:27.440 --> 08:15:36.240
there's one on the Colosseo are you gonna 100% avatar no I've never played the RDA side of avatar

08:15:36.240 --> 08:15:45.200
I don't like the RDA side it's speaking can I still visit Leonardo um I don't play the RDA

08:15:45.200 --> 08:15:51.600
side I only play the navi side um I will just be doing the navi I think the campaign's like

08:15:51.600 --> 08:16:01.680
six hours on that one if I can remember correctly um we'll be strange not seeing you before bed and

08:16:01.680 --> 08:16:08.400
waking up after yeah it's gonna be an interesting day but I do have endurance streams every week

08:16:08.400 --> 08:16:16.960
kind of planned as long as all goes well and I'll see what the clipping situation is uh

08:16:19.600 --> 08:16:20.560
hi Leonardo

08:16:21.440 --> 08:16:28.000
it's you the people apartments are in turmoil cesare is ill and the pope dead it was your doing

08:16:28.720 --> 08:16:33.120
was it not Leonardo I swear to you he did not die by my hand

08:16:33.920 --> 08:16:39.280
this world gets stranger every day I shall have to focus on my painting I work on the small

08:16:39.280 --> 08:16:45.440
portrait of a woman I'm growing rather fond of it hmm do not let a beautiful girl distract you

08:16:45.440 --> 08:16:53.040
from constructing my designs I have no worries women provide little distraction wait I don't get it

08:16:54.000 --> 08:16:57.760
he's a gay boy so it's pride month doesn't he be like that man

08:16:59.600 --> 08:17:02.880
doesn't he be like that that's nice oh I have everything

08:17:06.480 --> 08:17:11.040
if you decide to buy something look for the chalk outline on bench I don't have anything to

08:17:11.040 --> 08:17:19.200
purchase Leonardo about everything wait if I talk to him again you have all that I can give

08:17:19.200 --> 08:17:22.960
now you're on your own ah Leonardo give back you

08:17:25.280 --> 08:17:31.440
give me some of that good day for catching up on clips and bars and things and no endurance

08:17:31.440 --> 08:17:37.120
yeah um so the clipping situation I don't want the girls feeling stressed out thinking like I have

08:17:37.120 --> 08:17:41.120
to click like and stream at the same time and like deal with all this and try and do collabs

08:17:41.120 --> 08:17:46.160
all the girls and all that uh and deal with audios and blah blah blah so I don't want to stress them

08:17:46.160 --> 08:17:52.880
out so when you guys like do a make a youtube clip I can go on their accounts and see what

08:17:52.880 --> 08:17:59.280
someone's clipped and if it is like clippable worthy I can then send the timestamp onto like an

08:17:59.280 --> 08:18:07.440
actual clip editor to make clips for them um I just need to see how it works out in theory

08:18:07.440 --> 08:18:11.440
obviously when I do endurance streams I can't do any of it like right now for them um

08:18:11.520 --> 08:18:21.040
but we will see how it goes I don't know if I need to like put out a little ad saying like I need

08:18:21.040 --> 08:18:26.560
more clippers of this particular style because there's a particular clipping editing style

08:18:27.280 --> 08:18:34.720
that I'm looking for the most recent mersey shorts the blonde hair short and the other

08:18:35.280 --> 08:18:43.280
short a forgotten um is the clipping style so if you really can do that editing style

08:18:44.080 --> 08:18:50.560
you know don't be afraid to hit up the website uh because that's kind of what I'm needing at this point

08:18:51.440 --> 08:18:56.720
good thing I got a few clips already my job is not nice either if you're a general clipper

08:18:56.720 --> 08:19:02.080
uh we just I'm still interested in doing the clipping enterprise that like idol end done

08:19:02.080 --> 08:19:07.040
which is really good um obviously need to get monetized first and set up and see whether my

08:19:07.040 --> 08:19:13.360
funds and the money looks like and all that um because will it tell you a really embarrassing fact

08:19:14.160 --> 08:19:23.920
you know the earlier uh like um the earlier uh clips that came out shorts that were on the

08:19:23.920 --> 08:19:29.920
girls channels um emmy made two of her a couple of shorts on her own actually

08:19:30.560 --> 08:19:35.520
but I was editing them and I hated them so much and I was so embarrassed I was like I'm so sorry

08:19:35.520 --> 08:19:42.160
girls this is the best I can do because we had quite a few issues behind the scenes production

08:19:42.160 --> 08:19:49.520
wise with timing it was a freaking nightmare um so like all my attention was elsewhere and

08:19:50.320 --> 08:19:55.200
like I didn't have time to be like hi clippers here's this these files like please wear them

08:19:56.160 --> 08:20:01.120
um which that's where I did fail like looking back like obviously I'm happy like talk about

08:20:01.120 --> 08:20:04.080
like where I failed the girls and like I definitely feel like I've failed with them

08:20:04.880 --> 08:20:11.440
on the clips because the actual plan was the count school live for two weeks before stream

08:20:11.440 --> 08:20:18.640
and there'll be a clip uploaded every day and like I kind of failed the girls like doing that and

08:20:18.640 --> 08:20:24.800
I feel really bad about it like I feel wrong um but like the dust is kind of set off already done

08:20:24.800 --> 08:20:35.040
this but the dust is like kind of settling now the only bad thing is that for now time zone only

08:20:35.040 --> 08:20:43.440
you and I see stream at normal times okay you may be not in a normal way yeah

08:20:51.360 --> 08:20:54.880
no like it definitely went well like absolutely no denying like

08:20:55.760 --> 08:20:56.800
where am I trying to go

08:21:00.880 --> 08:21:10.880
um I'm definitely not denying like debut went well and everything just like I had planned

08:21:10.880 --> 08:21:16.400
things to just be a lot better and obviously it's not realistic to be like all my plans are all

08:21:16.400 --> 08:21:20.240
I just realized I need to leave the face uh we're going to be jumping off this building for quite

08:21:20.240 --> 08:21:27.920
well um like I understand it's not possible for everything are you serious it's for everything

08:21:27.920 --> 08:21:34.960
to like come out the way of my head um like the girls trailers didn't come out the way I wanted

08:21:34.960 --> 08:21:41.920
them to um but because of like production issues I couldn't get things like fixed or altered in

08:21:41.920 --> 08:21:52.000
time for anything really and it was just like ah but yeah yeah are you winning strong absolutely um

08:21:52.000 --> 08:22:00.000
are you winning excuse me I'm using this hay bale I'm so sorry if this makes anyone motion sick

08:22:00.000 --> 08:22:05.280
I'm needing to do leaps of faith and if you jump off a pigeon thing it counts as a leap of faith

08:22:06.160 --> 08:22:12.400
no it's ill into the hay bale no it's ill into the hay bale

08:22:15.600 --> 08:22:22.480
yeah it was a timing issue um we love artists in this house we do but um

08:22:23.840 --> 08:22:32.880
I had given very I feel I had gave incredibly fair deadlines for what I was asking

08:22:32.880 --> 08:22:42.320
and pretty much across the board the majority went over and if you are an artist that worked

08:22:42.320 --> 08:22:48.400
with me and you did go over deadline like please don't worry um like it's not like a big deal

08:22:48.400 --> 08:22:52.880
anymore because obviously now everything's out there and everything's all good and we debuted and

08:22:52.960 --> 08:23:03.360
like that's that's the facts but I had a lot of delays and basically I had planned every month in

08:23:03.360 --> 08:23:08.880
advance being like this month I'll be focused on this this month I'll be focused on that and what

08:23:08.880 --> 08:23:18.720
happened was everything had to be done in May and like I'm not gonna lie I like cried a few times

08:23:18.720 --> 08:23:26.160
out of just like pure frustration of like feeling I can't do enough because I have to wait for

08:23:27.120 --> 08:23:34.080
someone to send something back in order for me to progress and give feedback like I had a lot of

08:23:35.840 --> 08:23:42.480
like issues with um people not checking what they gave me the first time around and being like

08:23:42.480 --> 08:23:49.440
hey the reference sheet looks like this or hey um like the subtitle that you put here um like it's

08:23:49.440 --> 08:23:54.960
quite clear that she didn't say this but you've literally put it in for some reason or like hey

08:23:54.960 --> 08:23:59.840
the audio literally cuts out in the middle of this can you re-render like I don't know what like

08:24:00.800 --> 08:24:08.240
it was it was rubbish and at the same time like obviously the the girls know a bit more in detail

08:24:08.320 --> 08:24:15.120
exactly what I'm talking about um because like I showed them like we are like I'm constantly

08:24:15.120 --> 08:24:20.160
sending back like please fix this please fix this please fix this and the days are going by and the

08:24:20.160 --> 08:24:25.120
fixes are taking 24 hours the fixes aren't done within 20 minutes and I get a new rendered version

08:24:25.120 --> 08:24:30.640
of something it's like no 24 hours I'll do it in the morning I'll do it later and I'm like I have

08:24:30.640 --> 08:24:37.040
paid premium rates I shouldn't be the one who is quality checking your work you should quality

08:24:37.040 --> 08:24:43.840
check it before you send it to me and like bro it was just a cascading effect and it was pretty

08:24:43.840 --> 08:24:53.440
horrible um but yeah but we're here now so and there were so many lessons learned like um

08:24:54.400 --> 08:24:58.880
ripped to future artists if you're interested in working with Veeler but like everyone's getting

08:24:58.880 --> 08:25:07.040
contracts like conscripted and stuff like um and being like if you miss this deadline like

08:25:07.040 --> 08:25:14.640
you know it's just there's just it's not fun being like that like I love giving artists the

08:25:14.640 --> 08:25:23.680
benefit of the doubt but holy is this even counting for leaps of faith uh yeah like deadlines are so

08:25:23.680 --> 08:25:34.960
important and having that like oh wow we're one off of leaf of faith um literally in the end we

08:25:34.960 --> 08:25:40.880
made it everything worked out fight wait did that guard hurt himself I don't remember hurting him um

08:25:42.160 --> 08:25:49.840
like we made it in the end but yeah rough rough not fun but I'm now like I just want to stream

08:25:49.840 --> 08:25:53.040
I just want to have fun I want to show off my games I want to have a good time I want to make

08:25:53.040 --> 08:25:57.760
ASMR I want to do everything that I've wanted to do while I get to do it alongside like these

08:25:57.760 --> 08:26:02.560
amazing girls type thing um and I want them to see them achieve their dreams and see how it goes

08:26:02.560 --> 08:26:07.600
like obviously the the the current goal is YouTube to please stop calling us and like

08:26:07.600 --> 08:26:12.240
admit that we're real like streamers and stuff you don't need colors like there's plenty of content

08:26:13.600 --> 08:26:19.200
on the channels now but yeah like it definitely like everything works out in the end

08:26:19.200 --> 08:26:23.360
absolutely is everyone max level

08:26:26.320 --> 08:26:34.000
no three people aren't max oh I didn't mean to do that but hey yeah like the worst part is over

08:26:35.200 --> 08:26:43.920
wait what the heck oopsies I'm to kill the mailman not to be confused with the sand man

08:26:43.920 --> 08:26:49.680
that blows literal dust over your eyelashes or some shiz that was ridiculous

08:26:50.880 --> 08:26:58.160
never heard of that first time I've ever heard of that nonsense before I heard the song but like what

08:27:03.920 --> 08:27:05.040
oh for goodness sake

08:27:05.040 --> 08:27:16.640
okay they're open oh I love how easy that stuff is wonderful

08:27:18.800 --> 08:27:24.400
oh uh excuse me am I not your mentor that's got pushed off of them

08:27:26.960 --> 08:27:31.760
oh no the PayPal got fixed um so you can support any of the girls like right now

08:27:31.760 --> 08:27:36.320
I think I need to update my link or something because people say it no work or something

08:27:40.800 --> 08:27:45.120
oh you're using the new info I can't believe it YouTube on softwares

08:27:46.080 --> 08:27:50.080
it's old european folklore of course it's nonsense true

08:27:52.720 --> 08:27:53.680
a little retrieve

08:27:53.680 --> 08:27:59.600
right I don't really know what the plan is

08:28:04.080 --> 08:28:11.200
okay we'll finish the guild people's requests but I have to admit I'm a bit lost on what next to do

08:28:12.160 --> 08:28:14.960
um

08:28:19.600 --> 08:28:24.960
get all the guild requests buy everything and then I think we might be done maybe the feathers

08:28:27.360 --> 08:28:32.080
um and we'll revisit it at a non-profit question mark

08:28:32.720 --> 08:28:34.320
uh mercy 30 minute

08:28:38.000 --> 08:28:40.240
did I get the feather from this location I must go

08:28:42.240 --> 08:28:42.800
shit then

08:28:45.040 --> 08:28:46.320
cause a little chaos why not

08:28:49.760 --> 08:28:54.000
Christina oh I forgot about Christina oh right okay okay okay

08:28:54.880 --> 08:29:01.680
oh I've completed all the renovations

08:29:03.200 --> 08:29:04.560
wait so what's my DNA

08:29:06.560 --> 08:29:09.440
it must be high enough seriously six to eight

08:29:11.680 --> 08:29:13.760
is there anything I could do that's really easy

08:29:16.800 --> 08:29:18.240
no no

08:29:24.640 --> 08:29:28.240
I didn't want to do do you know be to take

08:29:28.240 --> 08:29:28.640
it

08:29:36.400 --> 08:29:39.280
wait a minute did this one

08:29:50.000 --> 08:29:53.600
that was rubbish that one did not look like I discovered it no that was rubbish as well

08:29:54.720 --> 08:29:58.320
that was rubbish as well

08:29:59.040 --> 08:29:59.760
that was rubbish

08:30:01.600 --> 08:30:02.720
and maybe the missions

08:30:12.160 --> 08:30:15.040
I've never achieved that that's not even possible

08:30:15.840 --> 08:30:24.080
no these like so aren't possible maybe I need to do

08:30:27.120 --> 08:30:28.880
wait the assassinations are only uh

08:30:30.880 --> 08:30:33.920
oh the assassinations are like only at 41

08:30:37.760 --> 08:30:41.680
okay okay we'll do assassins that'll raise us that'll raise us really quickly like they're

08:30:41.680 --> 08:30:47.600
super easy super nice and uh consider it so we'll do that we'll do that

08:30:57.360 --> 08:30:58.640
just climbing up ladders don't mind me

08:31:03.360 --> 08:31:03.840
hey

08:31:05.760 --> 08:31:07.840
you all excited for my first day some more stream

08:31:08.640 --> 08:31:15.520
I'm doing something mildly special in it I'm a bit concerned after what happened to me but

08:31:15.520 --> 08:31:19.760
he apparently she was jumping up and doing on the bed like a monkey

08:31:25.200 --> 08:31:27.680
yeah were you there did you hear about this did you see this

08:31:29.360 --> 08:31:31.520
what was my cute little sister doing on the bed hello

08:31:31.920 --> 08:31:34.400
hmm

08:31:36.720 --> 08:31:41.360
one little in me jumping on the bed and she jumped off and bumped her head

08:31:44.240 --> 08:31:45.440
how is she jumping down

08:31:49.120 --> 08:31:53.760
oh let's see the board you have unleashed their interrogate if they cannot find us we'll

08:31:53.760 --> 08:32:00.560
burl us people do not let your targets call for reinforcements oh I don't know what that means

08:32:01.360 --> 08:32:05.200
kill wait does that mean like don't get detected

08:32:06.640 --> 08:32:12.000
she had to fall and land on her ear somehow yeah I remember reading someone's review on it and I was

08:32:12.000 --> 08:32:24.080
like no I want all my children to succeed but apparently apparently we were spitting and

08:32:24.080 --> 08:32:33.120
licking it back up how do you plead to these accusations in me how do you plead to such accusations

08:32:38.960 --> 08:32:39.600
actually

08:32:41.920 --> 08:32:50.160
pin pals how do you plead to the accusations that you egged your little sister on

08:32:50.480 --> 08:32:54.560
to do such devious acts

08:33:08.000 --> 08:33:15.200
a guard is running for backup who who they're all highlighted

08:33:20.480 --> 08:33:21.600
no I got kill bruised

08:33:25.280 --> 08:33:30.960
I don't know where that guy ran I'm not really mad at it because I'm still gonna get DNA anyway but

08:33:38.080 --> 08:33:39.840
oh there's scaffold in there I could have grabbed him

08:33:40.640 --> 08:33:50.800
not guilty I plead the fifth egged Emmy on oh that's funny what is she egging you guys on

08:33:52.480 --> 08:33:56.400
these accusations against my little sister I will not stand for such things

08:34:00.480 --> 08:34:02.320
right okay let's keep doing

08:34:02.560 --> 08:34:05.280
these

08:34:12.640 --> 08:34:20.640
she knew what she was doing my innocent little sister has no concept of what even a double

08:34:20.640 --> 08:34:27.840
meaning is you are looking at her through your your lusty eyes how dare you

08:34:27.840 --> 08:34:38.080
have no how dare you labeling on the innocent the innocent target yet it because that's what

08:34:38.080 --> 08:34:44.160
the name of her goes it's all true she's always egging us on

08:34:48.720 --> 08:34:54.160
right I'm gonna send away those assassins that aren't ready to level out properly

08:34:54.720 --> 08:35:01.360
I'll send you on a big big contract big big big big contract

08:35:03.360 --> 08:35:08.640
one two three four five of you

08:35:13.920 --> 08:35:17.440
she turned a guy into a tree like he was asking for okay

08:35:17.760 --> 08:35:23.040
yeah she needs to level up okay she needs to experience what she's doing

08:35:24.240 --> 08:35:30.720
it's not hurtful right we seem to be about 42% use the assassin recruits to assist in

08:35:31.680 --> 08:35:38.320
diversion kill the merchant while remaining undetected easy easy let me squeeze

08:35:40.480 --> 08:35:44.400
gotta get that XP somehow you know what you're right her latest

08:35:45.280 --> 08:35:49.840
alt tweet probably is a misunderstanding exactly you're just reading it wrong okay

08:35:56.000 --> 08:35:57.440
can I like lock on to the guy

08:36:04.640 --> 08:36:06.080
well let me recall my recruit

08:36:09.680 --> 08:36:11.280
is it bugged out oh

08:36:15.200 --> 08:36:21.280
oh wait what was the mission use the assassin recruits to assist the night diversion

08:36:25.760 --> 08:36:33.600
oh well that was easy peasy lemon squeezy what's going on here we are discussing how

08:36:34.560 --> 08:36:40.800
how pin pals have you so misunderstood they're looking at you with

08:36:54.080 --> 08:37:00.960
they do I'm trying to tell them that you're innocent okay and that they're not comprehending

08:37:01.920 --> 08:37:08.720
that the you jumping up and down on the bed during your ASMR stream is completely innocent

08:37:08.720 --> 08:37:16.480
and you were literally just singing that song three little monkeys jumping in the bed one fell

08:37:16.480 --> 08:37:22.400
off and bumped its head first game the doctor or something like that i don't know something's in

08:37:23.120 --> 08:37:23.840
sure

08:37:26.880 --> 08:37:27.760
all right i don't get

08:37:31.920 --> 08:37:33.840
we'll do the feathers

08:37:38.160 --> 08:37:39.440
i'm not innocent that's for you

08:37:49.120 --> 08:37:51.440
who among us is innocent truly

08:37:52.800 --> 08:37:56.640
if i were making them among those reference to emi's lore there

08:37:57.440 --> 08:38:03.440
i was like did you like that uh oh wait i don't need to go off and go down

08:38:15.760 --> 08:38:20.800
you leave me sucking out of this you know it has potential don't tell my other one

08:38:21.760 --> 08:38:22.800
i won't accept such

08:38:25.760 --> 08:38:28.000
right you need to jump up here in order to get this flag

08:38:29.680 --> 08:38:33.600
i named him to come across more thieves to do the lure i think i have like two more

08:38:34.320 --> 08:38:40.880
thieves need to lure the guards away i'm sad i missed on these i mean i don't good i'm

08:38:40.880 --> 08:38:46.800
like 99% sure yeah emi's probably gonna do it and it is some more streaming in

08:38:47.520 --> 08:39:00.640
just uh maybe a little less uh a little less ump perhaps you know we can't escape

08:39:02.160 --> 08:39:09.200
the suck it could be another brand of ruler it should be for the the innocent uh the innocent

08:39:09.200 --> 08:39:14.000
side where i just make them do like girlfriend roleplay audios or like that kind of stuff but

08:39:14.000 --> 08:39:18.000
like it's nothing it doesn't like go any further you know

08:39:21.760 --> 08:39:28.880
safer work side that people have been asking for i did get a few emails um management showed me

08:39:28.880 --> 08:39:37.200
them and people were like uh is it required to do that and it was like yep that's very sadly

08:39:37.280 --> 08:39:42.160
kind of the the whole point of the agency um that's where the money is um

08:39:45.040 --> 08:39:49.440
oh oh wait no there's not bored your people here anymore i was getting nervous so i was

08:39:49.440 --> 08:39:54.480
gonna get caught and i'm like wait a minute there's no border oh the books are so good

08:39:55.280 --> 08:40:01.760
eye contact roleplay teaching you eye contact proof i don't know the best way to climb this

08:40:01.760 --> 08:40:04.480
maybe on the outside of the policy that looks up man

08:40:07.840 --> 08:40:09.200
give me that feather

08:40:12.640 --> 08:40:13.440
true love

08:40:14.320 --> 08:40:20.160
girlfriend roleplay something what could a hand-holder roleplay blessing yeah like so i did have a few

08:40:20.160 --> 08:40:26.080
variations of like would there ever be a generation that didn't require that part and it's like

08:40:26.080 --> 08:40:31.360
what's the point it's just a real agency at that point

08:40:34.320 --> 08:40:41.600
um where the hype was that other feather oh it's literally split perfectly in the middle

08:40:42.640 --> 08:40:49.040
where there is the jump off point oh wait we have a parachute all right we'll just use a

08:40:49.040 --> 08:40:50.240
parachute off the coliseum

08:40:56.640 --> 08:40:59.760
temple popping roughly where you can hear audible oh in me

08:41:06.240 --> 08:41:07.280
right we're just gonna do this

08:41:07.280 --> 08:41:13.120
here assassinate

08:41:16.400 --> 08:41:22.560
group roleplay is a few uh group roleplay is actually seventh as well i'm coming out

08:41:23.760 --> 08:41:28.480
uh it just came in each time to sell i only want them to come out once the calling has stopped

08:41:28.480 --> 08:41:38.480
because literally it's like such a shame that it is still happening even though like we're like

08:41:38.480 --> 08:41:41.920
getting into the stage where it's like yeah we've like got proper streams now so i'm not really

08:41:41.920 --> 08:41:47.920
sure what the deal is like the meme asmr's are literally i'm too scared to even upload them

08:41:47.920 --> 08:41:52.320
at this point because i'm like what's going on with asmr i think there may have been a stealth

08:41:52.320 --> 08:41:58.160
policy update or it's about to be introduced publicly uh feathers up here um

08:42:04.240 --> 08:42:10.640
this is a little sister you argued has an innocent name yeah i'm not arguing in what's

08:42:10.640 --> 08:42:17.360
innocent it was oh cool okay right we're gonna use the

08:42:21.360 --> 08:42:27.040
yeah there's definitely something going on at youtube headquarters when it comes to asmr because

08:42:28.320 --> 08:42:33.920
there's a lot of channels left and right getting yanked for content that previously was fine

08:42:34.720 --> 08:42:43.040
and they're my guess is that youtube don't want to publicly say it because asmr is such a popular

08:42:43.040 --> 08:42:48.800
category on youtube like it's an insanely popular category and they don't want to come out and say

08:42:48.800 --> 08:42:58.720
it so they're just tackling it like silently basically so it's not arguing this thing um

08:42:59.520 --> 08:43:06.240
i i think the uproar if they publicly said like we're doing this would be so much because asmr

08:43:06.240 --> 08:43:12.080
i think they like said it's like one of the top four categories sorry like in the top 10 searches

08:43:12.080 --> 08:43:18.240
a variation of either like foodie in or asmr medicines like whatever you want to kind of

08:43:18.240 --> 08:43:25.920
really get into it um it's like such a high watched category that if they publicly said like

08:43:25.920 --> 08:43:31.120
hey we're drawing the line here now i do think there will be a post at some point

08:43:31.120 --> 08:43:37.920
but at the moment it's kind of stealthily being done so the content is no longer available so when

08:43:37.920 --> 08:43:45.120
they do go publicly like hey we've actually changed this people are like oh that's fine because

08:43:45.120 --> 08:43:49.920
like no one's been uploading it anyway because you know you've been deleting channels less than

08:43:49.920 --> 08:43:57.760
right and uh handing out warnings willy nilly so yeah that's my guess by the way this is absolutely

08:43:57.760 --> 08:44:06.880
not factual this is like just what my genuine like what i think is going on um youtube is

08:44:06.880 --> 08:44:13.040
just like i see yeah it's literally just my guess what's going on it seems the most probable to me

08:44:13.360 --> 08:44:23.600
um so unfortunately i think like you're looking content it's just gonna have to be like

08:44:25.600 --> 08:44:38.160
just straight up upload it to twitter or put on patreon solution and i know a lot of people are

08:44:38.160 --> 08:44:44.720
like oh like just put it like not behind a paywall on patreon unfortunately in order to link your

08:44:44.720 --> 08:44:54.160
patreon successfully um everything must be behind the paywall for like even if it's a fine audio that

08:44:54.160 --> 08:45:01.520
is not wrong with it um it has to all be behind the paywall it's bizarre it's bizarre the rules get

08:45:01.520 --> 08:45:07.760
very arbitrary in memoria now you're wrong youtube's wrong

08:45:14.240 --> 08:45:24.320
all right let me see we've done the feathers i have no idea how many things i've done right we're

08:45:24.320 --> 08:45:26.480
getting close to doing the courtisms

08:45:31.600 --> 08:45:40.560
yeah like we're supposed to enemy stations right we're gonna do that now because i know

08:45:40.560 --> 08:45:47.600
how to do that you have to replay a memory from the french one

08:45:48.320 --> 08:45:50.880
no

08:45:55.280 --> 08:46:03.760
yes this is one can you stream to x i wouldn't stream on twitter no need money

08:46:05.840 --> 08:46:09.520
like i hate to i hate to be that one i know it sounds really sucky we're like money money money

08:46:09.520 --> 08:46:15.200
but it's like the obviously the girls need my support and the thing with youtube vods is like

08:46:16.160 --> 08:46:22.960
you always like make money on youtube vods and like oh yeah once inside your men can

08:46:22.960 --> 08:46:27.120
overpower the camp's patrols correct made money around yes especially if they're patrolling

08:46:27.120 --> 08:46:31.040
i think it's fine saying like yes we're not an agency for greed but at the end of the day we need to

08:46:31.040 --> 08:46:37.680
liberate several suits of french armor and don't and youtube vods is like a fantastic way or the

08:46:37.760 --> 08:46:44.800
youtube adds on like a smaller video for example like this kind of stuff is like free to make

08:46:44.800 --> 08:46:48.880
content like it's free for me to scream right now you know troops will gather it from the dead

08:46:48.880 --> 08:46:55.680
and people underestimate the value of ad revenue via advertise like the free like add

08:46:56.400 --> 08:46:58.720
the armor has to stay clean

08:47:01.280 --> 08:47:07.760
right if you use your crossbow ball in this mission it accepts that last thing like

08:47:07.760 --> 08:47:11.040
oh there's a horse right there oh there's another horse right there

08:47:15.840 --> 08:47:20.000
business is business can't do everything for you unfortunately yes the world does run on

08:47:20.560 --> 08:47:24.800
no i'm not going now because really peace forever to get to these days

08:47:26.080 --> 08:47:32.240
um we'll go this way instead yeah this way is like so much better you basically for some reason

08:47:32.240 --> 08:47:40.960
if you snipe the guys in this one um they count towards that court is on thing but if you snipe

08:47:40.960 --> 08:47:46.880
in general it doesn't count oh sugar i'm sorry no i didn't want to do that

08:47:50.080 --> 08:47:56.400
actually hold on hold on i'm gonna disarm and kill with this one weapon there we go one of five

08:47:57.360 --> 08:48:05.120
nine percent of all my problems from silver money it is a terrible

08:48:11.600 --> 08:48:17.200
okay we might have to do this place place i'm not sure well that guy's coming over to

08:48:17.200 --> 08:48:24.400
investigate thank you another free kill is that guy coming to investigate oh these guys are

08:48:24.400 --> 08:48:32.040
I'll take it.

08:48:32.040 --> 08:48:35.840
I will loot them just so I can get some of them back.

08:48:35.840 --> 08:48:43.120
That's how the next one might be.

08:48:43.120 --> 08:48:48.600
We appreciate that thing, but please do always consider supporting the girls.

08:48:49.600 --> 08:48:52.600
We should get crossbow bolts from this.

08:48:52.600 --> 08:48:54.600
Hydration check, hydration check.

08:48:54.600 --> 08:49:00.600
I've been yammering, but I've not had much water today.

08:49:00.600 --> 08:49:06.600
I don't know when we can submit for monetization yet.

08:49:06.600 --> 08:49:10.600
As I said, the stats are no update.

08:49:10.600 --> 08:49:15.600
So it's kind of just...

08:49:15.600 --> 08:49:18.600
They're very casually like...

08:49:18.600 --> 08:49:20.600
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

08:49:20.600 --> 08:49:22.600
Oh, excuse me, sorry.

08:49:22.600 --> 08:49:24.600
Okay, I'm going to help.

08:49:24.600 --> 08:49:26.600
I'm calling the assassins and...

08:49:29.600 --> 08:49:32.600
Oh, I just teabagged them as they died.

08:49:32.600 --> 08:49:35.600
Okay, that was a rather unit.

08:49:35.600 --> 08:49:37.600
Let's not do that again.

08:49:37.600 --> 08:49:40.600
That was really not a move.

08:49:41.600 --> 08:49:44.600
Mm-hmm.

08:49:44.600 --> 08:49:56.600
But yes, once the YouTube calling stops, then please do look around for very fun ASMR collabs coming out.

08:49:56.600 --> 08:50:01.600
Very, very large ASMR collabs that cost a lot of money put together by Heihou.

08:50:02.600 --> 08:50:19.600
Um, sorry, I'm trying to bramble and think and get this done.

08:50:19.600 --> 08:50:27.600
I like how he's suspicious even though I literally just perished that guy right there.

08:50:27.600 --> 08:50:30.600
God, I wish there was a way to pay for all the girls' patrons at once.

08:50:30.600 --> 08:50:32.600
I just got 16 months back to back.

08:50:32.600 --> 08:50:33.600
Oh, you support them as patrons?

08:50:33.600 --> 08:50:34.600
Thank you so much.

08:50:34.600 --> 08:50:35.600
That's very kind of you.

08:50:35.600 --> 08:50:36.600
Thank you.

08:50:36.600 --> 08:50:42.600
Yes, actually, special thank you to literally anyone who has supported the girls on Patreon.

08:50:42.600 --> 08:50:52.600
I understand the patrons that you have one audio and it's very kind of you to like, you know, reach out and do that even though there's literally one audio.

08:50:52.600 --> 08:50:57.600
And there are coming because the audio is released on the first.

08:50:57.600 --> 08:51:02.600
The girls are going to have a consistent day that their audio in particular comes out.

08:51:02.600 --> 08:51:05.600
I really hope this is counting towards the challenge, actually.

08:51:05.600 --> 08:51:07.600
Um...

08:51:11.600 --> 08:51:14.600
Grave, I'm having to go all the way around.

08:51:15.600 --> 08:51:18.600
Wow.

08:51:21.600 --> 08:51:22.600
Okay, that was it.

08:51:22.600 --> 08:51:27.600
Right, I just need to redo that and then I think that'll be it for the mission.

08:51:27.600 --> 08:51:30.600
Eh, for the crotch design.

08:51:30.600 --> 08:51:33.600
Right, let me just check the DNA sequence.

08:51:33.600 --> 08:51:35.600
I say that as I literally just close it.

08:51:35.600 --> 08:51:39.600
That should have counted quite a bit towards that one.

08:51:42.600 --> 08:51:43.600
Two?

08:51:44.600 --> 08:51:49.600
That came in as two.

08:51:54.600 --> 08:51:56.600
Why did that not work?

08:51:57.600 --> 08:52:00.600
Is it because I kept getting detected?

08:52:02.600 --> 08:52:04.600
Oh, brother.

08:52:08.600 --> 08:52:10.600
Guards on horseback ears.

08:52:10.600 --> 08:52:13.600
Guards killed Will on horseback.

08:52:15.600 --> 08:52:20.600
PayPal guards, I need to go all the way.

08:52:22.600 --> 08:52:24.600
Guards air assassinate from a beam.

08:52:24.600 --> 08:52:27.600
Actually, we're closer to getting the thieves done.

08:52:27.600 --> 08:52:29.600
I need to find a beam.

08:52:29.600 --> 08:52:32.600
I don't know where the beam is to assassinate them.

08:52:34.600 --> 08:52:37.600
The mercenaries one is like absolute killer.

08:52:37.600 --> 08:52:39.600
So we got a patreoner just paid for you.

08:52:39.600 --> 08:52:42.600
Oh, thank you so much for the support, I appreciate it.

08:52:43.600 --> 08:52:46.600
Y'all are expected way more hate.

08:52:46.600 --> 08:52:51.600
Honestly, I think we all did, but I think everyone's just on the same page.

08:52:51.600 --> 08:52:58.600
You're probably tired at this point of your reach over just teasing and teasing and never giving anything.

08:52:58.600 --> 08:53:02.600
And then it's like, yeah, we're just having a good time.

08:53:02.600 --> 08:53:04.600
If you want the goods, you know where they are.

08:53:04.600 --> 08:53:06.600
If you don't, there's also free stuff coming out.

08:53:06.600 --> 08:53:09.600
There's a free video game coming out.

08:53:10.600 --> 08:53:13.600
I think it probably helps without the greed out.

08:53:13.600 --> 08:53:18.600
I think if it was a greedy looking corporation, that probably wouldn't help.

08:53:22.600 --> 08:53:26.600
Right, I'm going to bump into guards and then run away from them and hide in spots.

08:53:28.600 --> 08:53:30.600
We'll do the bump because there's a hay bale right here.

08:53:31.600 --> 08:53:32.600
Excuse me?

08:53:33.600 --> 08:53:34.600
Oh, sugar.

08:53:34.600 --> 08:53:36.600
Oh, I don't think I can hide in this.

08:53:37.600 --> 08:53:42.600
Okay, let's see how fast can I hide now?

08:53:47.600 --> 08:53:48.600
Oh, no.

08:53:48.600 --> 08:53:50.600
Oh, no, they're right next to me.

08:53:53.600 --> 08:53:54.600
No, don't check it.

08:53:54.600 --> 08:53:55.600
Don't check it.

08:53:55.600 --> 08:53:56.600
Don't check it.

08:53:56.600 --> 08:53:57.600
Don't check it.

08:53:57.600 --> 08:53:58.600
Don't check it.

08:54:00.600 --> 08:54:03.600
That shouldn't happen.

08:54:03.600 --> 08:54:05.600
Oh, there's more guards up here.

08:54:05.600 --> 08:54:08.600
I thought this district was like, there's no guards here at all.

08:54:16.600 --> 08:54:17.600
Oh, yes, the bench.

08:54:17.600 --> 08:54:18.600
The bench of safety.

08:54:18.600 --> 08:54:21.600
Okay, I can't go on the bench because it's not like...

08:54:21.600 --> 08:54:24.600
Oh, for goodness sake, how many of you are there?

08:54:26.600 --> 08:54:28.600
Oh, right, I'm hiding in here.

08:54:28.600 --> 08:54:29.600
Can't get me.

08:54:32.600 --> 08:54:33.600
Does that count?

08:54:36.600 --> 08:54:37.600
Did it count?

08:54:37.600 --> 08:54:39.600
He seems still annoyed at me.

08:54:40.600 --> 08:54:43.600
I'm just going to check that counted because if it does...

08:54:44.600 --> 08:54:45.600
Not the poking.

08:54:45.600 --> 08:54:50.600
If that did count, I'm literally just going to keep upsetting those guards over and over to do that again and again.

08:54:52.600 --> 08:54:53.600
I think it should have counted those.

08:54:54.600 --> 08:54:55.600
I did it!

08:54:55.600 --> 08:54:56.600
Right, time to keep bumping into them.

08:54:56.600 --> 08:55:00.600
I'm going to kill this guard up here though because he's going to keep ruining it.

08:55:03.600 --> 08:55:04.600
Yeah.

08:55:06.600 --> 08:55:07.600
Woo!

08:55:11.600 --> 08:55:12.600
Oh!

08:55:12.600 --> 08:55:13.600
Ow!

08:55:14.600 --> 08:55:17.600
Right, let's go upset some guards.

08:55:21.600 --> 08:55:23.600
You smell so bad!

08:55:24.600 --> 08:55:25.600
Tee hee!

08:55:25.600 --> 08:55:27.600
Now you have to chase me.

08:55:30.600 --> 08:55:32.600
Miss me, miss me, now you have to kiss me.

08:55:33.600 --> 08:55:35.600
Oh, is that supposed to jump off?

08:55:40.600 --> 08:55:41.600
Where's the bail hay?

08:55:41.600 --> 08:55:42.600
Oh, there it is.

08:55:52.600 --> 08:55:53.600
A...

08:55:53.600 --> 08:55:54.600
Six.

08:56:00.600 --> 08:56:01.600
Yank!

08:56:03.600 --> 08:56:04.600
I've got to get out of here!

08:56:04.600 --> 08:56:05.600
I've got to get out of here!

08:56:16.600 --> 08:56:19.600
And then we just dive into this again.

08:56:22.600 --> 08:56:23.600
Oh!

08:56:25.600 --> 08:56:26.600
I'm not sure that counted.

08:56:26.600 --> 08:56:28.600
He was like so close.

08:56:29.600 --> 08:56:30.600
You guys should know.

08:56:32.600 --> 08:56:33.600
No, I'm sorry.

08:56:33.600 --> 08:56:34.600
Please excuse me.

08:56:34.600 --> 08:56:35.600
Ah, please excuse me.

08:56:35.600 --> 08:56:36.600
I'm scared.

08:56:36.600 --> 08:56:37.600
There's a table in the way.

08:56:37.600 --> 08:56:38.600
I got nervous.

08:56:38.600 --> 08:56:39.600
I'm sorry.

08:56:42.600 --> 08:56:43.600
Oh no, I can't claim this way.

08:56:43.600 --> 08:56:44.600
Okay, he jumped down again.

08:56:46.600 --> 08:56:47.600
Ah!

08:56:47.600 --> 08:56:48.600
He's gone a long last.

08:56:48.600 --> 08:56:49.600
Please leave him.

08:56:50.600 --> 08:56:51.600
Leave me alone.

08:56:52.600 --> 08:56:53.600
Ah!

08:56:55.600 --> 08:56:56.600
Jump!

08:56:59.600 --> 08:57:01.600
They're like instantly giving up.

08:57:01.600 --> 08:57:04.600
I'm like really worried that it's not counting, but...

08:57:08.600 --> 08:57:09.600
No, it is.

08:57:09.600 --> 08:57:11.600
It just doesn't look like it.

08:57:11.600 --> 08:57:12.600
It looks so silly.

08:57:15.600 --> 08:57:16.600
And Mercy online?

08:57:16.600 --> 08:57:18.600
Heck yeah, Mercy's online.

08:57:18.600 --> 08:57:19.600
Let's go.

08:57:23.600 --> 08:57:26.600
Is there any mods still even awake at this point?

08:57:26.600 --> 08:57:27.600
You're more than welcome to link.

08:57:28.600 --> 08:57:29.600
Mercy.

08:57:32.600 --> 08:57:34.600
And please enjoy your stream.

08:57:35.600 --> 08:57:38.600
I think we're going to wrap up the guild's challenge.

08:57:38.600 --> 08:57:39.600
Oh!

08:57:39.600 --> 08:57:40.600
I hit C.

08:57:40.600 --> 08:57:41.600
I'm just going to squat in the hairball.

08:57:44.600 --> 08:57:45.600
See you in the clip.

08:57:53.600 --> 08:57:54.600
Can you hear that?

08:57:54.600 --> 08:57:55.600
Or am I going crazy?

08:57:59.600 --> 08:58:00.600
Am I going...

08:58:02.600 --> 08:58:05.600
Did I hear that right?

08:58:05.600 --> 08:58:06.600
Yeah, okay.

08:58:06.600 --> 08:58:07.600
I'm going to...

08:58:07.600 --> 08:58:08.600
I was like...

08:58:08.600 --> 08:58:10.600
Are you all hearing that thing?

08:58:12.600 --> 08:58:13.600
Literally.

08:58:15.600 --> 08:58:20.600
I wonder if it's left over ambience from the party sequence with the banker.

08:58:21.600 --> 08:58:22.600
Last one.

08:58:24.600 --> 08:58:25.600
Okay.

08:58:28.600 --> 08:58:29.600
I hear it again.

08:58:29.600 --> 08:58:31.600
Is there like people here?

08:58:31.600 --> 08:58:33.600
Or is it just SFX?

08:58:35.600 --> 08:58:36.600
More like SFX.

08:58:40.600 --> 08:58:42.600
Yeah, there's not even coded people to be here.

08:58:42.600 --> 08:58:44.600
I must just be background ambience.

08:58:44.600 --> 08:58:48.600
That's left over from the party sequence with the banker.

08:58:49.600 --> 08:58:54.600
Let's get notoriety down a little bit because guards are getting really aggressive.

08:58:55.600 --> 08:58:57.600
There's still asset, literally.

08:58:57.600 --> 08:58:59.600
The party ended many a day ago.

08:59:00.600 --> 08:59:02.600
They just played an operation.

08:59:04.600 --> 08:59:05.600
Crazy.

08:59:05.600 --> 08:59:06.600
That's crazy.

08:59:06.600 --> 08:59:07.600
Right.

08:59:08.600 --> 08:59:10.600
I'm starting to get a bit delirious.

08:59:12.600 --> 08:59:14.600
How much should we survive though?

08:59:24.600 --> 08:59:25.600
Mm-hmm.

08:59:25.600 --> 08:59:26.600
Mm-hmm.

08:59:27.600 --> 08:59:29.600
I don't know why that did so little.

08:59:36.600 --> 08:59:38.600
I'm watching all the girls, right?

08:59:39.600 --> 08:59:41.600
A long watch strategy before...

08:59:41.600 --> 08:59:42.600
Isn't there not too much noise?

08:59:42.600 --> 08:59:44.600
Like, there's too much noise going on.

08:59:44.600 --> 08:59:45.600
Like, focus.

08:59:48.600 --> 08:59:50.600
We're all blabbing away at once.

08:59:51.600 --> 08:59:52.600
Blabbing.

08:59:57.600 --> 08:59:59.600
I'm not too sure what to do.

08:59:59.600 --> 09:00:00.600
I'm kind of getting...

09:00:00.600 --> 09:00:01.600
I'm not, like, stuck.

09:00:01.600 --> 09:00:02.600
I know we can do those things.

09:00:02.600 --> 09:00:06.600
I'm just, like, I don't know where the beam is for what we want to do.

09:00:09.600 --> 09:00:10.600
Um...

09:00:14.600 --> 09:00:15.600
I'm just, like...

09:00:16.600 --> 09:00:19.600
Do we call it and then the next thing come on?

09:00:19.600 --> 09:00:20.600
Am I gonna...

09:00:20.600 --> 09:00:22.600
I'm like, I'm saying it myself.

09:00:22.600 --> 09:00:25.600
Am I gonna be annoyed at myself if I call it right now?

09:00:25.600 --> 09:00:26.600
Is one.

09:00:27.600 --> 09:00:28.600
Think I'm...

09:00:28.600 --> 09:00:30.600
I think I'm in back yet?

09:00:31.600 --> 09:00:34.600
Oh, in 19 seconds they come back.

09:00:35.600 --> 09:00:41.600
Right, let me find a group of thieves to hire at least so I can get rid of that.

09:00:44.600 --> 09:00:45.600
I can only focus...

09:00:45.600 --> 09:00:46.600
It's hard to multitask.

09:00:46.600 --> 09:00:48.600
I'm watchable script, right?

09:00:50.600 --> 09:00:51.600
But Mercy is alive.

09:00:51.600 --> 09:00:52.600
If anyone would like to watch...

09:00:52.600 --> 09:00:53.600
Mm, Mercy Modis.

09:00:55.600 --> 09:00:56.600
Oh, I saw that.

09:00:56.600 --> 09:00:57.600
Okay, there are...

09:00:58.600 --> 09:01:01.600
There are thieves somewhere on the roof up here.

09:01:04.600 --> 09:01:05.600
No.

09:01:11.600 --> 09:01:12.600
I'm just coercing.

09:01:13.600 --> 09:01:14.600
Um...

09:01:14.600 --> 09:01:15.600
Um...

09:01:17.600 --> 09:01:22.600
I think for simplicity we'll just teleport to the thieves guild in order to hire them.

09:01:22.600 --> 09:01:24.600
I struggle so much to find thieves.

09:01:24.600 --> 09:01:28.600
I understand they're on roof tops, but they make it so freaking hard.

09:01:29.600 --> 09:01:30.600
Run Vods of...

09:01:31.600 --> 09:01:34.600
Run Vods of all six at once and let it just fry your brain.

09:01:35.600 --> 09:01:37.600
Most of that is four, but only one audio.

09:01:37.600 --> 09:01:43.600
Yeah, like I understand maybe for like a collab stream you like meet everyone but one person and then get saved once POV.

09:01:45.600 --> 09:01:46.600
Mm...

09:01:46.600 --> 09:01:48.600
I have teleported to the wrong place.

09:01:48.600 --> 09:01:49.600
I was not paying attention.

09:01:49.600 --> 09:01:50.600
I apologize.

09:01:50.600 --> 09:01:52.600
Oh wait, there's somewhere I can buy.

09:01:52.600 --> 09:01:53.600
Hello?

09:01:53.600 --> 09:01:55.600
Would you like to be purchased?

09:01:59.600 --> 09:02:01.600
It would be a shame not to do Christina though.

09:02:01.600 --> 09:02:03.600
Like we're actually so close.

09:02:06.600 --> 09:02:07.600
Ah!

09:02:08.600 --> 09:02:11.600
What's the percentage we need for Christina?

09:02:15.600 --> 09:02:20.600
Why is your accent so cool?

09:02:20.600 --> 09:02:22.600
Spondin' Scotland!

09:02:23.600 --> 09:02:24.600
And...

09:02:24.600 --> 09:02:26.600
Always be Scottish.

09:02:26.600 --> 09:02:28.600
It's very hard to unlearn that accent.

09:02:29.600 --> 09:02:30.600
I even think it's possible.

09:02:32.600 --> 09:02:33.600
Truly outlawing it.

09:02:34.600 --> 09:02:35.600
Um...

09:02:35.600 --> 09:02:36.600
Why was I here again?

09:02:36.600 --> 09:02:40.600
Oh, to hire thieves and there's literally no thieves hanging out here.

09:02:41.600 --> 09:02:43.600
I need to hire one group of thieves.

09:02:43.600 --> 09:02:44.600
Is this for real?

09:02:44.600 --> 09:02:45.600
For real?

09:02:45.600 --> 09:02:46.600
Like for real?

09:02:46.600 --> 09:02:47.600
For real?

09:02:49.600 --> 09:02:54.600
Well, I need to find a beam that enemies pass over.

09:02:55.600 --> 09:02:58.600
And it's kind of in this general area.

09:02:59.600 --> 09:03:00.600
I'm at...

09:03:02.600 --> 09:03:04.600
Unbelievably.

09:03:04.600 --> 09:03:06.600
I'm at 69%.

09:03:06.600 --> 09:03:07.600
Um...

09:03:11.600 --> 09:03:12.600
Like...

09:03:13.600 --> 09:03:14.600
I don't know why.

09:03:15.600 --> 09:03:17.600
Locate memory and world.

09:03:17.600 --> 09:03:19.600
Insufficient data to accent.

09:03:19.600 --> 09:03:20.600
Locate memory and world.

09:03:20.600 --> 09:03:23.600
Go to memory start point to synchronize with animals.

09:03:23.600 --> 09:03:24.600
Gotta go to work.

09:03:24.600 --> 09:03:26.600
Have fun at work.

09:03:26.600 --> 09:03:29.600
If you could have any other accent, what would it be?

09:03:35.600 --> 09:03:36.600
Ah!

09:03:36.600 --> 09:03:38.600
Copernacle might have a lot of percentage in it.

09:03:38.600 --> 09:03:39.600
That's missing.

09:03:39.600 --> 09:03:40.600
We'll do Copernacle.

09:03:41.600 --> 09:03:43.600
Um, as for accent...

09:03:48.600 --> 09:03:50.600
I can't imagine myself wearing her now, honestly.

09:03:51.600 --> 09:03:52.600
Like, to pick one.

09:03:53.600 --> 09:03:55.600
The Italian accent can be really nice.

09:03:55.600 --> 09:04:00.600
Although the Japanese voices are so nice and pitched.

09:04:02.600 --> 09:04:04.600
Which I really enjoy.

09:04:04.600 --> 09:04:07.600
But I guess it's pitch and no actual voice.

09:04:10.600 --> 09:04:11.600
Uh...

09:04:12.600 --> 09:04:13.600
Her accent.

09:04:15.600 --> 09:04:21.600
Honestly, I don't actually mind a Polish accent.

09:04:21.600 --> 09:04:25.600
If you've ever listened to a sweet Polish accent,

09:04:25.600 --> 09:04:27.600
it can actually be really soothing.

09:04:28.600 --> 09:04:31.600
Just a little hint of her words from that.

09:04:31.600 --> 09:04:32.600
It's pretty good.

09:04:32.600 --> 09:04:35.600
Apply the Scottish accent to any language.

09:04:35.600 --> 09:04:36.600
Any language.

09:04:38.600 --> 09:04:39.600
Oh, you might apply it.

09:04:43.600 --> 09:04:44.600
I want you.

09:04:47.600 --> 09:04:48.600
I want sex now.

09:04:51.600 --> 09:04:52.600
As you believed.

09:04:55.600 --> 09:04:56.600
Volgmae.

09:04:57.600 --> 09:04:58.600
That's Scottish Dutch.

09:05:01.600 --> 09:05:02.600
That's pretty awful.

09:05:03.600 --> 09:05:04.600
Pray rough.

09:05:04.600 --> 09:05:05.600
Pray rough.

09:05:05.600 --> 09:05:07.600
Right, we'll try Copernacle,

09:05:07.600 --> 09:05:11.600
but this doesn't like dramatically raise the DNA.

09:05:11.600 --> 09:05:12.600
I think I'm gonna...

09:05:12.600 --> 09:05:14.600
I think I'm perishing.

09:05:15.600 --> 09:05:16.600
Unfortunately.

09:05:18.600 --> 09:05:22.600
And it might be wiser to redirect into Mercy

09:05:22.600 --> 09:05:23.600
and kind of have a break

09:05:23.600 --> 09:05:26.600
and deal with these ASMR collages

09:05:26.600 --> 09:05:27.600
and see what I'm looking at,

09:05:27.600 --> 09:05:31.600
because I think someone might be waiting on me to edit.

09:05:31.600 --> 09:05:34.600
The world itself is unchanging.

09:05:34.600 --> 09:05:37.600
We must change to understand it.

09:05:37.600 --> 09:05:38.600
It's secret.

09:05:39.600 --> 09:05:41.600
Scottish is the best accent in British Isles.

09:05:41.600 --> 09:05:42.600
Who is this man?

09:05:43.600 --> 09:05:44.600
He comes from Russia.

09:05:44.600 --> 09:05:45.600
The Welsh accent.

09:05:45.600 --> 09:05:46.600
I hear his studies at Iboticalo,

09:05:46.600 --> 09:05:49.600
but his words are unlike any other issue from that place.

09:05:50.600 --> 09:05:52.600
I don't buy it to put Scottish accents first.

09:05:53.600 --> 09:05:54.600
Scottish is magical.

09:05:54.600 --> 09:05:56.600
Hearing German speaking with songs that we're in.

09:05:56.600 --> 09:05:58.600
You're not good at the spheres dancing around the earth.

09:05:59.600 --> 09:06:01.600
You know you have a good source accent

09:06:01.600 --> 09:06:03.600
when people can't even understand you.

09:06:07.600 --> 09:06:09.600
I could use an excuse to go to bed.

09:06:09.600 --> 09:06:10.600
Yeah, I'm kind of like,

09:06:10.600 --> 09:06:11.600
I think I'm actually lagging.

09:06:11.600 --> 09:06:12.600
I can't believe it.

09:06:12.600 --> 09:06:15.600
You're me saying I'm an endurance streamer.

09:06:15.600 --> 09:06:16.600
I'm a liar.

09:06:19.600 --> 09:06:20.600
How long did we make it?

09:06:20.600 --> 09:06:21.600
How long did we make it?

09:06:27.600 --> 09:06:29.600
Take no damage during the ambush.

09:06:29.600 --> 09:06:30.600
Right, get the wee knife.

09:06:32.600 --> 09:06:33.600
Two minutes!

09:06:36.600 --> 09:06:37.600
Let's get the wee knife.

09:06:40.600 --> 09:06:41.600
No.

09:06:42.600 --> 09:06:43.600
Yeah, that's what I meant.

09:06:44.600 --> 09:06:47.600
I'm going to call in two of my assassins.

09:06:50.600 --> 09:06:52.600
That was way too early.

09:06:52.600 --> 09:06:54.600
You saw the way he was wiggling that knife.

09:06:58.600 --> 09:06:59.600
Whoa, why are you...

09:06:59.600 --> 09:07:01.600
You know the guy that's right in front of us?

09:07:01.600 --> 09:07:02.600
Maybe focus on my guy.

09:07:05.600 --> 09:07:06.600
Oh no, my assassins...

09:07:07.600 --> 09:07:09.600
Okay, my assassins are sticking around,

09:07:09.600 --> 09:07:10.600
which I'm quite happy about.

09:07:10.600 --> 09:07:12.600
I don't want to call in the last batch of assassins.

09:07:13.600 --> 09:07:15.600
Just because...

09:07:16.600 --> 09:07:18.600
If they kill them too fast,

09:07:18.600 --> 09:07:20.600
they actually might all be spawned

09:07:20.600 --> 09:07:21.600
and not help me at all,

09:07:21.600 --> 09:07:23.600
which is quite funny to think about.

09:07:24.600 --> 09:07:26.600
I do wish citizens would stop running

09:07:26.600 --> 09:07:28.600
into the middle of the fight or near it.

09:07:28.600 --> 09:07:29.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:07:29.600 --> 09:07:30.600
Don't hurt me, please.

09:07:31.600 --> 09:07:33.600
If I take no damage, I win.

09:07:37.600 --> 09:07:38.600
Oh.

09:07:38.600 --> 09:07:39.600
I'm scared!

09:07:39.600 --> 09:07:42.600
He's got such a long, frickin' pole!

09:07:42.600 --> 09:07:44.600
He's got such a long, frickin' pole!

09:07:45.600 --> 09:07:47.600
He's gonna hit me with it!

09:07:50.600 --> 09:07:52.600
My assassin is trying to chase them,

09:07:52.600 --> 09:07:53.600
but it's not happening.

09:07:58.600 --> 09:07:59.600
I'm just hiding.

09:07:59.600 --> 09:08:01.600
I'm letting my assassins do it.

09:08:01.600 --> 09:08:02.600
Copernicus is fine.

09:08:02.600 --> 09:08:04.600
His health bar is fine.

09:08:08.600 --> 09:08:09.600
Oh, I got fined.

09:08:09.600 --> 09:08:10.600
Oh, they caught me.

09:08:12.600 --> 09:08:14.600
I don't want to get hit.

09:08:14.600 --> 09:08:15.600
I'm so close to doing no hit.

09:08:15.600 --> 09:08:18.600
Please, please, please.

09:08:18.600 --> 09:08:19.600
Please.

09:08:19.600 --> 09:08:21.600
Literally 13 seconds is all I ask.

09:08:23.600 --> 09:08:24.600
Don't change up.

09:08:24.600 --> 09:08:26.600
Don't do anything else.

09:08:27.600 --> 09:08:29.600
Just four more seconds.

09:08:31.600 --> 09:08:32.600
Okay, we did it.

09:08:33.600 --> 09:08:34.600
We did it.

09:08:34.600 --> 09:08:35.600
We did it.

09:08:35.600 --> 09:08:36.600
We did it.

09:08:36.600 --> 09:08:37.600
We did it.

09:08:37.600 --> 09:08:38.600
We did it.

09:08:38.600 --> 09:08:39.600
We did it.

09:08:39.600 --> 09:08:40.600
I think we can do it.

09:08:40.600 --> 09:08:41.600
I'm still running away

09:08:41.600 --> 09:08:42.600
in case it counts.

09:08:42.600 --> 09:08:43.600
I think it counts,

09:08:43.600 --> 09:08:44.600
but I'm just gonna keep running,

09:08:44.600 --> 09:08:46.600
running and running

09:08:46.600 --> 09:08:48.600
in circles around the fountain.

09:08:48.600 --> 09:08:49.600
Okay.

09:08:52.600 --> 09:08:53.600
Yeah!

09:08:54.600 --> 09:08:55.600
That's right.

09:08:55.600 --> 09:08:56.600
I did that.

09:09:01.600 --> 09:09:02.600
What did I do?

09:09:05.600 --> 09:09:07.600
I didn't go up that much.

09:09:09.600 --> 09:09:11.600
Right, I have terrible news.

09:09:11.600 --> 09:09:13.600
Fake endurance streamer.

09:09:13.600 --> 09:09:14.600
Absolutely horrible news.

09:09:14.600 --> 09:09:15.600
100% poggers.

09:09:15.600 --> 09:09:16.600
Yay!

09:09:16.600 --> 09:09:18.600
You said 100%!

09:09:19.600 --> 09:09:21.600
Now, we may genuinely return

09:09:21.600 --> 09:09:23.600
to Brotherhood again

09:09:23.600 --> 09:09:24.600
at a later date.

09:09:26.600 --> 09:09:27.600
But I'm actually quite satisfied.

09:09:27.600 --> 09:09:28.600
Literally, we did the campaign.

09:09:28.600 --> 09:09:30.600
We've done all the DLC stuff now.

09:09:31.600 --> 09:09:32.600
You did that so hard

09:09:32.600 --> 09:09:34.600
that other people didn't find it.

09:09:36.600 --> 09:09:37.600
Strolling it, if you don't finish it,

09:09:37.600 --> 09:09:40.600
just means you need to do it.

09:09:40.600 --> 09:09:41.600
Yes, I actually wouldn't mind

09:09:41.600 --> 09:09:43.600
revisiting it at a later date.

09:09:43.600 --> 09:09:44.600
I would like to play a bit more

09:09:44.600 --> 09:09:46.600
Variety at this point.

09:09:46.600 --> 09:09:48.600
I'm going to redirect

09:09:48.600 --> 09:09:49.600
into

09:09:51.600 --> 09:09:53.600
Mercy, so we can all enjoy her.

09:09:54.600 --> 09:09:55.600
I can't believe it.

09:09:55.600 --> 09:09:56.600
I'm not a real endurance streamer.

09:09:56.600 --> 09:09:57.600
I only lasted

09:09:58.600 --> 09:09:59.600
nine hours this time.

09:09:59.600 --> 09:10:00.600
Gee willa curse.

09:10:01.600 --> 09:10:03.600
Oh, I'm kind of basic.

09:10:04.600 --> 09:10:05.600
I can't believe it.

09:10:05.600 --> 09:10:06.600
I can't believe it.

09:10:09.600 --> 09:10:11.600
Please do consider giving

09:10:11.600 --> 09:10:13.600
a like and a subscribe

09:10:13.600 --> 09:10:14.600
if you enjoyed.

09:10:14.600 --> 09:10:15.600
YouTube may have unscripted

09:10:16.600 --> 09:10:17.600
but don't worry,

09:10:17.600 --> 09:10:19.600
I'm going to redirect you

09:10:19.600 --> 09:10:20.600
into Mercy.

09:10:22.600 --> 09:10:23.600
Into Merchandise.

09:10:25.600 --> 09:10:28.600
Redirect, select stream.

09:10:28.600 --> 09:10:31.600
Oh, she's playing Omori.

09:10:31.600 --> 09:10:32.600
Omori.

09:10:33.600 --> 09:10:35.600
That's Omori

09:10:36.600 --> 09:10:37.600
when

09:10:37.600 --> 09:10:39.600
Mercy plays

09:10:39.600 --> 09:10:41.600
the tippy tippy thing.

09:10:43.600 --> 09:10:44.600
That's pretty good.

09:10:44.600 --> 09:10:45.600
Yeah, that's pretty good.

09:10:55.600 --> 09:10:57.600
I got a copyright

09:10:57.600 --> 09:10:59.600
on my Assassin's Creed Playthrough game

09:10:59.600 --> 09:11:00.600
yesterday.

09:11:01.600 --> 09:11:02.600
What?

09:11:02.600 --> 09:11:03.600
Sorry, I just spotted that right now

09:11:03.600 --> 09:11:04.600
and I'm like,

09:11:04.600 --> 09:11:05.600
what?

09:11:05.600 --> 09:11:06.600
I apologize.

09:11:06.600 --> 09:11:08.600
Thank you so, so much

09:11:08.600 --> 09:11:10.600
my lovely beflings

09:11:10.600 --> 09:11:11.600
for watching.

09:11:12.600 --> 09:11:13.600
Literally, I just checked it out.

09:11:13.600 --> 09:11:14.600
I'm like, I'm pretty sure the game

09:11:14.600 --> 09:11:15.600
has no copyright,

09:11:15.600 --> 09:11:17.600
so it's a false copyright thing

09:11:17.600 --> 09:11:18.600
going on.

09:11:18.600 --> 09:11:19.600
But thank you so, so much

09:11:19.600 --> 09:11:20.600
for hanging out.

09:11:21.600 --> 09:11:23.600
Yeah, maybe not 100%

09:11:23.600 --> 09:11:24.600
for the first time,

09:11:24.600 --> 09:11:25.600
but we'll give it a shot.

09:11:25.600 --> 09:11:26.600
I think we'll come back

09:11:26.600 --> 09:11:27.600
and we'll feel refreshed

09:11:27.600 --> 09:11:28.600
at a later date

09:11:29.600 --> 09:11:30.600
because that was a lot of

09:11:30.600 --> 09:11:31.600
jumping about.

09:11:31.600 --> 09:11:32.600
I think that's brought

09:11:32.600 --> 09:11:33.600
20 hours

09:11:33.600 --> 09:11:34.600
combined

09:11:34.600 --> 09:11:35.600
at this point.

09:11:35.600 --> 09:11:36.600
So thank you

09:11:36.600 --> 09:11:37.600
so, so much for hanging.

09:11:37.600 --> 09:11:38.600
Tomorrow we're playing

09:11:38.600 --> 09:11:39.600
Needy Streamer Overload.

09:11:39.600 --> 09:11:41.600
I haven't played it.

09:11:41.600 --> 09:11:42.600
So I'm not quite sure

09:11:42.600 --> 09:11:43.600
what to expect,

09:11:43.600 --> 09:11:44.600
but it is a shorter stream

09:11:44.600 --> 09:11:45.600
for me.

09:11:45.600 --> 09:11:46.600
So for those of you

09:11:46.600 --> 09:11:47.600
who like the endurance side

09:11:47.600 --> 09:11:48.600
of things,

09:11:48.600 --> 09:11:49.600
I apologize,

09:11:49.600 --> 09:11:50.600
but my stamina

09:11:50.600 --> 09:11:51.600
is lacking tomorrow.

09:11:52.600 --> 09:11:53.600
But nevertheless,

09:11:53.600 --> 09:11:54.600
it's always fantastic.

09:11:54.600 --> 09:11:55.600
Thank you so, so much.

09:11:55.600 --> 09:11:56.600
My little beflings

09:11:56.600 --> 09:11:57.600
or those who are watching,

09:11:57.600 --> 09:12:01.600
and I will see you tomorrow

09:12:01.600 --> 09:12:03.600
and say hi to Mercy.

09:12:03.600 --> 09:12:04.600
I will talk,

09:12:04.600 --> 09:12:05.600
I will talk in Mercy's chat

09:12:05.600 --> 09:12:06.600
for a little bit,

09:12:06.600 --> 09:12:08.600
but I do need to go

09:12:08.600 --> 09:12:09.600
for the big P.

09:12:09.600 --> 09:12:10.600
I'm not even going to pretend

09:12:10.600 --> 09:12:11.600
otherwise,

09:12:11.600 --> 09:12:12.600
I need to pay pass.

09:12:12.600 --> 09:12:14.600
So I'll see you tomorrow.

09:12:14.600 --> 09:12:15.600
Okay, bye-bye.

09:12:21.600 --> 09:12:22.600
Bye-bye for now.

09:12:22.600 --> 09:12:23.600
See you tomorrow.

09:12:23.600 --> 09:12:24.600
Bye-bye.

09:12:26.600 --> 09:12:27.600
Bye-bye.
