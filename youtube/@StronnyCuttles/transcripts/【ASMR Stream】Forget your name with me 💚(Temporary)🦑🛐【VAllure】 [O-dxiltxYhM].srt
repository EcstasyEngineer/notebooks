1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Just give me a moment.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Shhh.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Shhh.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They're good.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And...

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They're there.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I know this is a rather interesting concept.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So please be relieved to know that any bit that occurs between us is deeper, okay?

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You don't have to worry.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I would never do anything to hurt or harm you.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And the effects are gonna wear off after two hours.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Take away this and maybe even less for the effects, cause when I bring you back up, you'll remember.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But just let it up.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm gonna bring you deep down with me.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, for the interesting question, I'd like for you to ponder my darling.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You've been called one name your entire life, haven't you?

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do you think you're susceptible enough to forget that name for a small amount of time?

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And maybe I can replace it?

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's okay, it's just something to think about, to ponder in your mind,

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,000
to imagine that I could see a fancy mix of words that would make you fall.

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You'd fail to recall something you may consider so important.

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It is your name after all, and your name means you, of course.

23
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But there's another name that I like.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's Riefling.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's why I like to call you for a little while.

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But the problem is you may not respond in the way I want you to, or the way I would like you to.

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And you may not realize why it means so much to me.

28
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hypnosis interests me, and it makes me excited at the same time.

29
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:08,000
At the prospect of playing with you, to have you just the way I want, even if it's for a little while.

30
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Some days giving up control can feel good, and I hope I can earn your trust if I haven't already with my reassurance.

31
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If that sounds like something you'd like to do with me, I'd really appreciate it.

32
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's okay to be apprehensive or worry if it's gonna work or not.

33
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If not, instead just use this day to relax and gently take a moment for yourself.

34
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you okay?

35
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Good.

36
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then, now you can close your eyes, or you can focus on me.

37
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Some people describe them as quite tantalizing, almost hard to look away from.

38
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Not in a strange way, but rather a soothing way.

39
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Like when you look into the flames of a fire, and it feels like your pupils are dilated.

40
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That kind of trance you enter when focusing deep on something, but letting your senses go and start slowly ignoring the outside world.

41
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I want to show you that this is all very okay.

42
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can be as slow as you need.

43
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think it's important to know what you're getting into.

44
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Enter the idea that you may be slowly falling deeper into trance.

45
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
As if I was a fire dancing before your eyes.

46
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Exit instead of an energetic burst of rain, please.

47
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Crackling and popping, I am a small, smoldering fire.

48
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I am warmth that can radiate gently against your skin, against your face.

49
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I am gentle, quiet, soothing, relaxing.

50
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You might even feel the warmth all over.

51
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Can you imagine it now for me?

52
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The warmth radiating from me onto your face, and then slowly down your neck,

53
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:09,000
past your shoulders, then equally turn your arm to your elbow.

54
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Your wrists until your hands are warm, it's not hot, it's a comfort sensation.

55
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I already ate more.

56
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Past your shoulders, turn your abdomen, to your stomach, then turn further to your hips.

57
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And again, that heat will equally split down your legs.

58
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're tied to your calves and down to your feet.

59
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It feels like an embrace.

60
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I want to embrace you.

61
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Both body and mind, at the same time.

62
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Would you let me in?

63
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Would you let yourself be open to what I offer?

64
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Maybe you think to yourself, should I resist?

65
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But then why would you want to?

66
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's so warm, and the rain here, eager and waiting.

67
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You love it to please others, and this would please me.

68
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Unless...

69
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What's this?

70
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Are you not able to think so clearly anymore to yourself?

71
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's alright, that's okay.

72
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That makes me happy that you're made to slowly switch off.

73
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's not fast, like a late switch, no.

74
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It takes time to let your brain go to sleep and be open to me.

75
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Just like a smoldering fire gives you warmth.

76
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That warmth slowly takes over until you may experience the pleasurable sensation of not forming a thought at all.

77
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Just listening to my voice, letting me take over slowly.

78
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:04,000
There's no rush, just you and me together going on this journey.

79
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If you could resist, you might be saying, what would it be like if you went under?

80
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And having me be the one in control of you.

81
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You know you can go even deeper with me.

82
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I think we would both enjoy, and you'd find the pleasure of all.

83
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think it would be worth every second that you're under.

84
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The good thing is, you don't have to think, you just have to let it happen to you.

85
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's right, very good.

86
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let me fully embrace your mind.

87
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Deeper and deeper, you'll know that only my voice remains in your head.

88
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Just look at me and forget it all.

89
00:15:47,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You are safe, you are loved, and by the day I finish it with you, you'll already want to go again.

90
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Down, down, down you go.

91
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Deeper and deeper and deeper, just like whatever happens happens.

92
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Either way, you will be relaxed by the end of it.

93
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I want to get there, and by the end, you'll be main, okay?

94
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Three, any voices get quieter until it's just made you hear.

95
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Two, the warmth fully taken over your body, you just accept.

96
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:23,000
One, as you now give up and offer no resistance at all.

97
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Zero, you are main, my darling.

98
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:58,000
My voice, always with you, and gating you steadily through all of this.

99
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're doing fantastic, you really are, and you're making me so happy right now.

100
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You know, how desirable it is for me to see that black expression of yours, right?

101
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
How precious it is.

102
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But we have a slight, small situation, don't we?

103
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I need you to learn your name.

104
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes, you are clean, blank, slate-ragena, with no name at all.

105
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's forgotten, and you have let me assign you a name.

106
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
A beautiful name that lets everyone know what an amazing man you are,

107
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and that you are owned by me, and it's okay of that illicit response.

108
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I encourage it.

109
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Your name is Riefling.

110
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Riefling, Riefling, Riefling, Riefling.

111
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But why, mistress, why is this name important?

112
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't worry, I'll answer the questions you might have if you could think right now.

113
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
My precious little Riefling.

114
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Riefling to me means unwavering loyalty that we show to one another.

115
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The kindness of two souls connect in any way we can,

116
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:23,000
whether for a passing moment or for an insatiable bond.

117
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The love that is shared between mistress and Riefling cannot be recreated elsewhere.

118
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's what we have together.

119
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Isn't that right, Riefling?

120
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Don't you hate it for me?

121
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Good Riefling.

122
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You make me so happy when you're in this state.

123
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, darling, do you remember that war and embrace from the smoldering fire earlier?

124
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's our love we share for one another, which we can ignite it and bring flames for an even warmer embrace.

125
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And I assure you, it's good.

126
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The flames can hurt us.

127
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Only have a burning desire for more.

128
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Maybe deep down, you can't wait for me to be in control again, alright?

129
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Even though you're under it right now, the desire for me to reassure you,

130
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:59,000
you will always be mine to look after, and you will never be a burden to me.

131
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I accept you from all your flaws, just as you accept me from mine.

132
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The embrace that you feel is unwavering love and is all around us.

133
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Sometimes it's harder to fade, but you will always have a place with me.

134
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I wish that life could be gentle and escaped as we are to one another,

135
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:07,000
but you will never feel sheep for desire or for yearning when it roped me.

136
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I may be in control of you, Refling, but I serve you.

137
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is not one side.

138
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is not me over you.

139
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
This is us, my darling Refling.

140
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I want to plant a small seed of influence, one of confidence that I know you deserve.

141
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Imagine in front of us a soil patch next to the warm fire that dances before our eyes.

142
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:21,000
We're on our knees before each other, looking into one another's eyes.

143
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I open my hand before you to reveal a seed.

144
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You take it from my hand and plant it without a word.

145
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I would ask you if you know what you've done, but you don't have the words for them right now.

146
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And that's okay.

147
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You just know you've done the right thing and made me happy.

148
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That seed can be nurtured over time, but you have to be the one to water it.

149
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Because once it grows, not only is it a symbol of what we have done for one another,

150
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
but you can be proud of it.

151
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You can be boastful.

152
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You can think yourself having a second wind of confidence that you are my Refling.

153
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And you have nothing to apologize for.

154
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I love you.

155
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There's just one thing though, Refling.

156
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I know your pain is easy, and it's hard to remember all the details other than what I say to you.

157
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But don't worry, that's good.

158
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I want to explain a bit more about myself, about my desires.

159
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Why I want this from you.

160
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I want to be in control of you, even if for a little time.

161
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It makes me feel powerful.

162
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It makes me happy to think a grown man like yourself is drooling and waiting for the next command to leave my life.

163
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I want to care for you when you're in such a wonderful state like this for me.

164
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Maybe I'm the only one who's ever gone to you like this before.

165
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
That would make me very happy.

166
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And keep the big secret of what you like.

167
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I won't shave you, I won't dull you or be mean.

168
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'd love to tease you though.

169
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Maybe one day I should suggest body paralysis and try to instruct you to do certain things with me.

170
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That kind of mean teasing is just one for me to consider right now.

171
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But in the future, if you go under by me again, then maybe I can give you special kinds of rewards.

172
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But for now, we have to be proper.

173
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You know how to behave, right?

174
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Like a good dog, a good little loyal wreathling for your mistress.

175
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Good boy.

176
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I love that my words alone could get you into such a deep trap.

177
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That warm feeling still all over you.

178
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Maybe it's even tingly.

179
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'd like that if you could both relax and have your night played with at the same time.

180
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I know I should.

181
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But your name is wreathling right now.

182
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I won.

183
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I basted you, but in a good way.

184
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Should you fight me, next day I try to put you under.

185
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Could you imagine the fun of having days I would get with you?

186
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I can imagine it.

187
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Can you?

188
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I would climb on top of you, look you deep in your eyes.

189
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You wouldn't be allowed to break eye contact, but you can feel the weight of my body against yours.

190
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The warmth radiating again.

191
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
War, war, war.

192
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's all too much to resist.

193
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's all you can think about.

194
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I place a sensation as the coziness it offers.

195
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The comfort of the smoothness that can be yours if you just give it.

196
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You wouldn't say no to me wreathling.

197
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I already do so much for you.

198
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:55,000
My words are good, but my actions are even bitter, aren't they?

199
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yes, they were certainly on.

200
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Can you gently drop deeper for me?

201
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Good, I want your brainless.

202
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:45,000
The only thing you know right now is my voice, and that your name is wreathling.

203
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You belong to me, and everything feels amazing.

204
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I think it's time to reward your subconscious too.

205
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I have to train every layer of your brain.

206
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
An intimate experience between you and I.

207
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
The warmth of the fire doesn't dissipate,

208
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:35,000
but I can help you cool down a little.

209
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I can help you cool down a little.

210
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It doesn't dissipate, but I can help you cool down a little.

211
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You never have to think again when you're with me.

212
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Come brainless with me.

213
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Relax.

214
00:37:39,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Let the numbness take over completely.

215
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Relax.

216
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You're safe.

217
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You're accepted.

218
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You're with me wreathling, and you're my responsibility to take care of.

219
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Relax.

220
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Let yourself space up.

221
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Ape the head.

222
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
No thoughts.

223
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Just me and you.

224
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Shhh.

225
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It's okay wreathling.

226
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You can let go.

227
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
You don't have to hold on anymore.

228
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Let me take over.

229
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Let me be in charge, and make the decisions.

230
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Let me make it easier for you.

231
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You can let go.

232
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's okay.

233
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'm here with you.

234
00:40:47,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Let go.

235
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Allow yourself to drift with me.

236
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Let go.

237
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It's okay.

238
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Let me look after you.

239
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Let me carry you.

240
00:41:48,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You just remain brainless, and numb.

241
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You just have to obey.

242
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Obey wreathling.

243
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You will obey me.

244
00:42:43,000 --> 00:43:01,000
There is no resistance, only acceptance.

245
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Deeper.

246
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Deeper.

247
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Deeper.

248
00:43:36,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Shhh.

249
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:16,000
There.

250
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Are you being conditioned? I wonder.

251
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Am I getting deep into your mind?

252
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Nothing happens now, and that's okay.

253
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:50,000
It's just me and my little wreathling.

254
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's a reward.

255
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
All this one-on-one attention.

256
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:15,000
If I did this, it shouldn't sell like you, but you need more.

257
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Because when you crave it, I'll be here.

258
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Obey wreathling to pamper you, over and over again, until you can't take it anymore.

259
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And you're just my 24-7.

260
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So deep that you can never fully go back.

261
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Because I'll be there in the back of your mind,

262
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:14,000
encouraging you every step of the way, influencing your day-to-day life,

263
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:25,000
inspiring you to be the man I know you can be.

264
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So be gained wreathling, because that's what you are.

265
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:45,000
A gained boy that deserves the world.

266
00:46:45,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Let's keep you relaxed.

267
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:23,000
For a little bit longer, okay?

268
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Repetition and hypnosis is really good.

269
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I wonder if that works for ASMRtists when I do to you while you're like glass.

270
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I wonder if you'd hear the trigger.

271
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And think of me.

272
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I'm not conditioning you, darling.

273
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Maybe my little wreathling, you're conditioning yourself.

274
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Does it save me with lots of different things?

275
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Now that would be happy that you'd be so susceptible to whiteness.

276
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That you could help yourself or stop your own mind.

277
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:06,000
My little wreathling.

278
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Let yourself relive.

279
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I give you permission to talk.

280
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
You're allowed to pleasure some blame.

281
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You're allowed to enjoy what you want.

282
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Okay.

283
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Good boy.

284
00:49:44,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Very good boy.

285
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
But I can't have you forever.

286
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:13,000
No one stays like this.

287
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
My little wreathling.

288
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
My little sleepy head.

289
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I think it's tight.

290
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I slowly and gently bring you back up.

291
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Okay.

292
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You're very deep right now with the ampers and the warmth.

293
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So we can do this together.

294
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Just listen to my voice and follow my instructions.

295
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I'm going to get upwards from zero to three.

296
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
One, three, you will wake up.

297
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Okay.

298
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And I will be with you.

299
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Every step of the way.

300
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Alright.

301
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It always works out in the end when we're together.

302
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It's just one small thing.

303
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I don't want you to remember the details of the session.

304
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Clearly.

305
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I think it would be more interesting

306
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
if your memory was positive but not quite clear in what we did together

307
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
or the things I said.

308
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Is that alright wreathling?

309
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Can I ask that of you?

310
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I think secrecy in our sessions is good.

311
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Even though it's a shame to know.

312
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Remember all the love we shared when you're so wonderful with me.

313
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Deep down you'll know.

314
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Maybe another day might make something for you

315
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
and I'll permit you to remember it all.

316
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You do still need my permission at the end of the day

317
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

318
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
If you want the effects to last

319
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
only respond to wreathling truly and wholeheartedly

320
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:57,000
and your name will come back in roughly two hours.

321
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Your little secret.

322
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Zero.

323
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
The embrace you feel from the fire

324
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
will still be inside you.

325
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I'll always be with you

326
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,000
but you may be able to feel the sensation

327
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
slowly making its way back.

328
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It feels less impactful

329
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
but not in a negative way

330
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
as the feeling reveres this

331
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and makes its way up to your head

332
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
where it once started.

333
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's like a fog on your mind

334
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
is lending slowly

335
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:21,000
as if being blown away by the wind.

336
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
What?

337
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You're aware that I'm talking to you

338
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
that I was able to get you very deep with me.

339
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Your thoughts return too

340
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
although they are incredibly quiet

341
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and my voice still takes precedence

342
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
over everything else.

343
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You just need to come up, up, up, alright?

344
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Keep doing it.

345
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You're doing so well.

346
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I know it's nice being under

347
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:20,000
but it's time to be brought up to consciousness.

348
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Dude, you're with me, aren't you?

349
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
You're aware that you are under

350
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
but it's not quite clear

351
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
everything we did together

352
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
and that's okay, Refling.

353
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I promise it was nothing bad

354
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
and I equally promise

355
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
that you did a great job for me

356
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and I still get to go you, Refling.

357
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Three, up, up, up

358
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
until you're back with me again.

359
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Hi, Refling.

360
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Hi, baby.

361
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Hello.

362
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Are you there?

363
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Are you back today?

364
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Hi.

365
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Hi, baby.

366
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Okay, bye.

367
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Hopefully you have a nice warm, fuzzy feeling right now.

368
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Well, I did need to spoil you lots of ASMR after came.

369
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Baby.

370
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Just so you know,

371
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
my little cutie pie

372
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I have spent one hour roughly

373
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
that's past since we got started.

374
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Okay.

375
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Just so you know, Casey,

376
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I know how much time passed, it's been one hour

377
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
but it's okay, baby.

378
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
My little Refling.

379
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Okay, give me one second.

380
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
One, two, three, four.

381
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Hi, baby.

382
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Hi, cutie pie.

383
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You did really well.

384
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
You did and it's true, you did, you did really, really well

385
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and I'm very, very happy.

386
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

387
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I was struggling a little bit but thank you pulled through for me.

388
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So I need to give you lots of cute after care with Tinka.

389
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Wow, good job.

390
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Hi, baby.

391
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Hi.

392
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Just relax a little bit, okay?

393
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And if you need to hydrate, you can.

394
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I'm happy to tingle you for a little bit longer.

395
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You are publicist, I can be publicist.

396
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yeah.

397
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Okay, I'm out.

398
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Thank you.

399
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Rock.

400
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Let me tingle you so I can do the bubbles.

401
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I don't know anything.

402
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Let me say what I missed, okay?

403
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Thank you, rock, rock, rock, rock,

404
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
rather than membership.

405
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Thank Lord Weed Smash.

406
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Real catmass, that was phenomenal, you like them.

407
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I am glad.

408
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
A darling girlity, bubble-sense for you

409
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
and Matt 1618 for 150 gift.

410
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Thank you so much.

411
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
All my babies.

412
01:01:36,000 --> 01:02:04,480
I don't think I took you too deep this time, or I don't, maybe I did take you too, I don't

413
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:27,200
but if you want we can talk about more hypnosis ideas that you'd like to see, I thought about maybe, or maybe not, training you to be a dog

414
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:43,200
Ording, please, whoopsies, thank you again mother the gifted membership

415
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,160
Listerine, just trying to hate you, right?

416
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:56,160
Gracie, Jessie, thank you for the super chat, that was amazing, you liked it

417
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,120
Shhh

418
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:11,120
I'm definitely being super careful when I do this because I get so scared

419
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:18,080
Love is a bit too service level, let me ease into it, okay?

420
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:28,080
You're woofing orange, your head feels numb but a good gain, I'm glad

421
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:36,080
It should be numb rafeling, my job here is complete

422
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,040
No, I will not elaborate further, bye

423
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:59,040
Getting the papa, cheers his bark bark, I have not even drained you into my puppy yet

424
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:08,000
He wants to meet my little puppy, do you want me to put a little collar on you as well?

425
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Ah, briefly, do it again

426
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,960
Oh, bye

427
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,960
I'll give your ears a little scratchy scratchy

428
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,960
Will you use a training clicker?

429
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,960
Ah, I should get one, I'ma miss you the fuck

430
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,960
Kill quick, thank you for the super chat, love in this stream

01:04:52,960 --> 01:05:00,960
Thank you, mom, hello, thank you for the gifted, 50 members as well

01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,920

01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,920
One second, thank you so much, mom, hello for the gifted

436
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:36,880

01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,880
Thank you so, so much and congrats to those god

438
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,880
This is just an aftercare session, okay?

439
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,880
Cause I gotta make sure you're okay

440
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,880
And you need to make sure you're hydrated too

441
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:57,840
Shhh, we found some

442
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:07,840
So the hypnosis sessions over, you can go back to the stream if you like the start

443
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,880
But this is the part where I take care of you

444
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,880
Cause it's not so easy

445
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,880
I can't put under make your brain or raise it

446
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,880
no over thinking

447
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,880

very very shy

456
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
I just tinkle you gently

457
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,880
as you hear the most licks in the background

458
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,880
now you don't have to have to check

459
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:11,880
okay fine

460
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,880

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,880
refling

470
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,880
for letting me play with you

471
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,880
I like having you in my hand

472
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,880
all malleable

473
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,880
and I get to do what I want with you

474
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,880
but that's the quiet part that comes later

475
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,880
here

476
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,880
I took beat up beyond your ears

477
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,880
did really well

478
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,880
do you think I can make good boy a trigger word?

479
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:35,880
good boy good boy good boy

480
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,880
all my refling is a good boy

481
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,880
and he makes me happy

482
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,880
he lets me play and tinkle him

483
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,880
and also take over his mind

484
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,880
you did really well on that session though

485
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,880
good boy makes you tingle

486
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,880
did so good

487
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,880
do it so so good

488
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,880
don't listen to the mask like this

489
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,880
shh shh shh shh

490
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,880
will there be more br...

491
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,880
refling

492
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,880
rye is done

493
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,880
yes when you put up like that

494
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,880
yes

495
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,880
there will be also hypnosis videos on my channel soon as well

496
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:01,880
you're gonna wall if you hear wall again

497
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,880
if you hear good boy

498
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,880
shh shh shh shh shh

499
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,880
there there

500
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,880
shh shh shh shh

501
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,880
hopefully you feel all tingly

502
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,880
and if I couldn't make you tingle

503
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,880
hopefully I made your pee pee tingle

504
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,880
I said

505
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,880
I said what others won't say

506
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,880
what you gonna do give me trouble

507
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,880
I mean I guess

508
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:59,880
yeah, it triggers your swallow reflex

509
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,880
do you know what that means?

510
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,880
it can mean that you're relaxed

511
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:15,880
or that you might be standing attention in response

512
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:25,880
you've been relaxing, I'm glad

513
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,880
I hope you feel a bit better, do you?

514
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,880
yeah

515
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:41,880
he done very well, yeah

516
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:51,880
I know some things getting into hypnosis can be a bit like, I don't know if it's safe or not, but it is

517
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,880
well, I hope I make it as safe as possible

518
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,880
so we can explore this together

519
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:06,880
because it is something new to explore

520
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,880
yeah

521
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,880
think a little bit longer

522
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,880
okay

523
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,880
okay

524
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,880
give you some more tingly-wingelies

525
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:37,880
but as always, there's no lasting effects from this stream

526
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:44,880
a little bit of influence, but a fix, nyaw

527
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,880
I look after you

528
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,880
I hope you feel like I look after you anyway

529
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,880
that's my goal

530
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:01,880
they make you feel good

531
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,880
does that make you an influencer? it's over

532
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:10,880
got the cameras

533
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:17,880
lasting love for mommy, lasting love for replaying

534
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:30,880
hey

535
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,880
yeah

536
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:43,880
I'm gonna see if I can give you a hug or not, this is either gonna work or this is gonna sound really really silly, okay?

537
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:49,880
but I'm gonna hug the microphone, so come here you big cuddly teddy bear

538
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,880
I don't know, I have no idea what you can hear right now

539
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,880
but I'm giving you a big hug

540
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,880
you can't kiss a tag, come on

541
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,880
that's right, you can't keep up with a kiss-a-shot

542
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:13,880
I love you like

543
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,880
mommy baby

544
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:24,880
here we go

545
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,880
are you gonna be okay, sleepyhead?

546
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,880
cuz you aren't the only sleepyhead around here

547
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:41,880
bye bye

548
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,880
are you gonna be okay, replaying?

549
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:55,880
I'm gonna send you to another ASMR stream, okay?

550
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,880
I got less than two hours sleep, so

551
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:09,880
mommy isn't feeling too hot right now, Evelyn, sorry baby

552
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,880
I don't want you to worry though

553
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,880
I'll be okay

554
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:21,880
I'm gonna go and get a big sleep, okay?

555
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,880
I had to prepare a lot to put you under

556
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,880
it's a labor of love, they say

557
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,880
but I enjoy putting it together for you

558
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,880
I feel rewarded when you let go

559
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,880
so it's worth every second

560
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,880
8 minutes, 1-8

561
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,880
thank you, have a good rest, yeah

562
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:02,880
I'm gonna send you to another ASMR stream

563
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,880
with a polar bear, okay?

564
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,880
I'll look after you very shortly, okay?

565
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,880
love you, little replay

566
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,880
be kind to yourself, okay darling?

567
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,880
I love you

568
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:39,880
I'll dream about hypnotizing you, okay?

569
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:44,880
and all the fucked up scenarios I wanna do, do ya?

570
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,880
hmm

571
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,880
say hi to AC from me, okay?

572
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:04,880

573
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,880
oh, you're lucky, you're lucky

574
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,880
I didn't know that, like, thank you for the extended membership

575
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,880
look into my small, refling eyes, you feeling going to sleep?

576
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:29,880
I'm gonna sleep, darling, I promise, okay?

577
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,880
