by accident hmm I'm on Azura stream but it doesn't say she's there but she's

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,680
live streaming though it says it's set for an hour yes every support I asked

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,400
Azura very kindly if she could give me one hour earlier and she said yes and

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,760
then we both realized 15 minutes before we were gonna go live that we don't

18
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,360
actually have the game downloaded so thank you for the game being tiny and we

99
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,160
having it no she has to be using the frickin radio between the eyes Azura I

100
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,720
have a code phrase between the eyes over between the eyes what's that I think

101
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,000
it's a hint for what you're to do something between the eyes over she's

102
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,560
so cute I love her so much I was like all we're gonna breeze through this game

103
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,680
don't worry I played it before I don't want to tell her what to do though I

104
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,040
found symbols on a wall okay perfect tell me what these symbols are over I

105
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:31,160
think this is the first one if I'm not mistaken yeah there's three there's

106
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:40,240
three rows and at the top three it's the first time was like a circle with with

107
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:49,240
a with the X across it and then one going in the middle okay Roger over

108
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,600
huh so I have identified the symbol but I need a symbol along with that either an

109
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,760
eye color pupil or a second shape over I love try hard in the video games what

110
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:11,080
eye color pupils eye color pupil I have a green eye potentially a blue eye or a

111
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:27,520
red eye over I have a red eye and a green eye red eye and a green eye do you

112
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,920
need us can you touch symbols in a wall over I think I remember this one I'm

113
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:51,280
cheating so much and you have a red left eye and a right green eye over I've

114
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,600
just caught up her comes can you repeat that over is this where we find out

115
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:06,600
can you repeat your last communication over a left red eye and a right green eye

116
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,680
over okay symbols are someone having diarrhea and then the next symbol to

117
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,080
touch is a circle with a cross and a line straight down over

118
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:32,680
oh come on tell me that's not a bot with someone having diarrhea straight over she's

119
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:45,280
talking but she's talking for red left and right green the first symbol is diarrhea a

120
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,400
little but with diarrhea straight up line going down it and then the second

121
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:59,760
symbol is an X a circle and a line going down over I thought it was a fancy tea like

122
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,160
an oh maybe maybe an upside down umbrella might help her a bit better none of

123
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,280
these look like diarrhea though other than that one

124
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,760
little diarrhea can't it couldn't be me I'm constipated again I don't think you

125
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:24,560
can click them all at once though only one at a time if so the diarrhea symbol or the

126
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:34,280
upside down umbrella like it got blown in the wind is your first symbol I click that and then

127
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,680
for your second symbol is a circle with a line down and an X through it over

128
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
I got I got an achievement I think you did it over

129
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,640

130
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,960
also an area for me there's more symbols no dear I have entered a room with

131
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,760
mutated animals and symbols that are related to them over

132
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:21,920
I'm sorry mutate mutated yes these animals are not normal they have different body parts

133
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:31,520
of other animals over I'm scared there's there's strange whispering happening happening in the

134
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:38,320
in the room I don't want to tell her there's an enemy in the room with her if you could just

135
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,280
find what symbols you need potentially maybe describe paintings in the room to me over

136
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,440

208
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,720
she should be here are you at a blue gate over it is open the blue gate is open okay

209
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,640
fuck um I need you to go north past the blue gate

210
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:27,280
and and then take east but take the first west as you go east so she's gonna be here

211
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
after that instruction

212
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,680

216
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,680
I've balled this up I think I balled this up what gate what did I do so if she goes here

217
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,360
she could close that green which closes that off and then she's locked in here so it can't be that

218
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,880
she has to go back and open up this blue and then what go up here and then close that and then she

219
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,720
can walk do that and then she can go in here do that which will lock that but then she can go

220
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:32,000
all the way back and then close and then in and then open and in okay uh where are you Azura on

221
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:42,800

00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,600

226
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,520
please go northeast and then enter the room to the right

227
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:15,040
this is a good puzzle I like this one honestly

228
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,440
there's a hallway here and yes in the room there we have blue lever

229
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,720
there's also a jump scare in this blue corridor here that she has no idea about

230
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,120
I wonder if she's gonna spot it or if she's gonna be too late

231
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,720
have you pulled a blue lever over

232

burp for your reefing okay I went west okay now you should be able to go north

235
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,240
she should see the jump scare up here if I'm not mistaken but maybe she was too late

277
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,080
first room that you come across going backwards over we'll have to tease and bully mummy in the

278
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,680
future stream to avenge Azura well Azura admitted to me she was trolling me in the among us collab

279
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,520
because she said she liked my Scottish accent coming out and she said when I'm angry it comes out

280
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:23,600
really quickly and I'm like oh I see how it is Azura okay I'll wait for her to pull that lever

281
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:32,480
I'll wait for her to communicate to me that she should be here is that the blue lever flicked over

282
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:49,440
okay go north and then take a west

283
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,400
this is about to time out I'm gonna very quickly do that and she just needs to go north

284
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,840
and we do love the angry scores Azura is one of us try to get my Scottish readout

285
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,320
take him west and then go north

286
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:21,200
and she's doing fine is the monster there still I don't know I don't know where it is

287
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:30,000
I don't know okay you're almost there you're doing great take an east and then you should

288
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,800
go past the blue gate over me just casually reminding her there's a slug somewhere in the

289
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:47,120
building although there is a map that she can get got on oh no it might be me that can get got

290
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,280
possibly okay I'm in here you've passed the blue gate there's a green lever pull it

291
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,240
she's looking for I can see her little eyes on her model looking left and right

292
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:12,960
she's found okay now go through the green gate over over go through the green gate and then take

293
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:23,200
the first west exit over where is this green gate it should be right next to the green lever if

294
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,360
you go north and east of the green lever over you mean the theater at the end right yeah I think

295
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:38,240
I can get got if only I could have teased her you got it are you out yeah I passed the gate

296
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,200

368
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:42,880
out of here I'm like stuck in this library I have a book here with symbols on it oh I have

369
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:58,240
books scattered around with symbols are you ready uh random um one um I have to explain these

370
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:06,320
symbols I have books scattered around with five symbols although they mean any there's one with

371
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:13,600
ears on it look like one with ears is icy which are pointy ears there and there's one with a

372
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:25,360
little flag at the tip of a mountain and then a guy in a jacuzzi over yeah a guy in a jacuzzi

373
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:33,680
and then there's a lantern with three circles three lights diamonds or circles over the heck is that

374
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:41,280
she said some guy standing on a boat wait with one eyeball I mean that's exactly what she's just

375
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,360
um as the fourth symbol got diamonds on the head and hands

376
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:57,120
no it's just a lantern like it's definitely circles over and then like three three two sticking out of

377
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:04,720
it on each side looks like the lamp like a lamp like Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast oh okay okay

378
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,640
whoa whoa whoa um is icys head fucking massive for her body

379
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,360
oh is icys head massive over

380
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,920
icys head is

381
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:34,400
decent these these medium is the hill humongous over oh big head with two arms sticking out

382
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,920
yeah two tiny stick arms for the first symbol body half oval body half oval body I don't think this

383
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:52,480
was the right one actually for the second symbol um is the hill like really massive over yeah it looks

384
00:48:52,480 --> 00:49:01,280
like a boom a boob no is it skinny I don't know what these books I can't remember what the freaking

385
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,680
book stage was well these books are so similar to what she's explaining it could be this one

386
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,760
um no it can't be that one because she said the last one's like a boat no it can't be that one either

387
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,440
um can you input these symbols anywhere like uh

388
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
I don't know what she needs me to do uh

389
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,480
uh

390
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:36,480
is it maybe down here that's the secret adrenaline is pumped okay so I walked onto a platform and

391
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:44,080
it murdered me oh um

392
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,080
okay I'm just I'm just trying to investigate what I can do for you

393
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,000
murdered her I don't have any instructions when I look at these books though there's like

394
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:08,080
it's just floor spears oh it only lets me give you the symbols I think I

395
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,560
the floor where there are no spear I know what to do okay you need to explain the symbols in

396
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,160
high detail okay did the symbols restart

397
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,560
I'm to look at the back of the book no it's yes the symbols did in fact restart but they

398
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:35,360
still look similar it's similar they are very similar on my end first one looks the same it's

399
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:42,000
like a small like oval half oval body with two sticks sticking out like a snow oh you know like

400
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:51,440
the snowman we the snowman one with the funny face what this one is now a face with the ears

401
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:59,920
are we different is it a fat necko vtuber yes or no yes that's okay with pointy ears is the next

402
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:07,360
one a medium pentus that has a little thing in his urethra over at this time with a line going

403
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:15,120
through the mountain like it's like a scoop that is a pentus and just one singular tip pointing

404
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:22,000
out that is a pentus pointing out that is a pentus as two big balls is it like a bird's eye view of

405
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:32,560
the balls there's a guy in a tucuzi still their head is a oval like a flower is it squished over

406
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:43,520
the the lantern has changed it now has three legs uh-huh yes that's not third leg is there three

407
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,200
diamonds on the tips at the top okay i think i've got the right one for once with with with pointy

408
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:55,600
with pointy pointy stick at the top yes yes not descending oh even when the sand is at the back

409
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:02,240
and then a person standing on a boat they have a dress one eyeball with oval head

410
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:08,320
actually really good was slightly bigger okay for the third symbol is oh she's a little hair on

411
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:16,800
their head there's no hair on the head just a stick yeah there's one one one little stick one

412
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,880
hair on the head one stick for the third symbol is the head of the man in the jacuzzi quite flat

413
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:32,320
but still an oval over yeah flat flat and oval right i have the correct thing but you need to

414
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:42,000
let me read all of it before you start moving okay okay okay now i'm going to read the instructions

415
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,640
out loud do not do them until i've read the full thing and we've figured it out okay because this

416
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:59,440
will keep resetting if we muck up in the western corner lies your start keep moving north but watch

417
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:08,000
your step before the last tile you must head east after those these two steps take one step towards

418
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
the south head for the eastern wall then you may proceed towards the door over so that

419
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:23,440
so just so you comprehend we have to follow these steps in order over okay oh yeah okay yeah yeah

420
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:31,440
yeah she has no fucking clue that's okay i love her okay and the western hemisphere is where you start

421
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:41,440
so the first but don't stand on it okay just where you start okay she did she's talking but she's not

422
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,560
talking at the very end yeah like to the left the west is where you start but don't stand on it okay

423
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,760
okay is she okay i'm ready to stream snap okay i'm here

424
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:08,160
but before the last tile you must head east wait how far east after these two okay i'm ready

425
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:16,320
okay you are going to start going forwards but before the very last tile you must stop

426
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,880
do not go on the last tile go on the second last tile north if that makes sense okay

427
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:29,920
surely happy she's a happy happy are you on it yeah kind of over

428
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:41,760

431
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,880

444
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:45,360
oh she went south oh my god i think it means two steps east brah i got played by english

445
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,040
brah okay let's try that again brah i literally got played by english i hate the english language

446
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:01,280
so much so what's the symbol is it the same it's not good it's the same you're very lucky

447
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:09,440
no way is it actually yeah they're the same i love it here okay western wall let's go

448
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:21,040
i've killed her so many times now right nothing can chase her you said two steps east right no

449
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,480
right i'm going to read it out to you and then we can use our logic together okay

450
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:34,960
she's talking but she's not okay right it says in the western corner lies your start so we'll go

451
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:48,880
there i'm there keep moving north but watch your step before the last tail okay so don't go all the

452
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:56,080
way north okay she's nodding she's nodding again okay now don't go anywhere read this with me okay

453
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:08,960
before your last tail you must head east okay so you can go east one you don't die on east one

454
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:21,680
okay then the book says after these two steps so you can go east twice question mark

455
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,960
so go east one to what she's doing she's i don't know if i should go to that tile i think i died on

456
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:40,640
the tile twice okay twice i just went one more step okay so you've gone east twice technically yes

457
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:50,640
if i step on this child wait wait wait i died on this don't go don't go don't go don't go don't go

458
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:58,000
don't go don't go oh don't go so from so from the western side you've gone east twice technically

459
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:08,400
yes yes okay now it says take one step towards the south head to the eastern wall then you may

460
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:16,240
proceed towards the door so i think you go south once then all the way east and then all the way

461
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,880
that makes sense right over

462
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:30,800
oh thank god i'm not doing that one again that was shite that's shite being Scottish that was awful

463
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:37,680
fucking english why did they do english like that brave right i'm going in a okay this is the one

464
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:44,720
where i can die i can see her model she has no idea what's going on she can hear it though

465
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,120
there's a show and i'm being hunted and she has no idea i'm just gonna let her have fun

466
00:59:53,120 --> 01:00:01,840
she'll figure out she'll figure out it's fine he has to watch them so i am on the other side of the show

467
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:11,040
a movie you are going to be pulling out scenes for me to watch

468
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,640
uh uh uh

469
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,200
um there should be a narration lever if i'm not mistaken

470
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,560
there's gonna be a monster right behind me isn't there oh it's not there yet well he comes up soon

471
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,720
there's a couple of lovers

472
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:48,080
two levers forbidden for being fooled in a horror puzzle game there's a goat goddess and a kulfish

473
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,640
and we have room temperature iq and i forget how the rest of the song goes but

474
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:05,120
super hard puzzles super hard puzzles they're really difficult because they're super super super

475
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:13,520
hard puzzles as they will get revenge there's the enemies sneaking up on me do you have a narration

476
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:22,480
lever what's what's that what's in a what a lever it's a lever that literally has narration on it

477
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,680
or maybe scene one something like that yeah it's a scene one on it if you pull it i think it gives

478
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:37,520
you dialogue scene one or does it give me the dialogue and i'm to tell her what to do with that

479
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,840
man i wish i could sit in the seats um

480
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,520
to the left and the right there should be like three levers for her to pull

481
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,680
how about you just pull everything out

482
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,800
would you want to pull out a zero i didn't say that to her i was asking the reflings to be honest

483
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,120
would you pull out of a zero i don't think you would you shouldn't all the girls are designed

484
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:10,000
not to be pulled out of uh do you see levers that you can mess with

485
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:20,560
yes i do one lever is broken though okay uh pull out of the other levers and i think i will be able

486
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,440

504
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:16,560

523
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:35,680
time you play there at the hotel or just pill stuff um just pill stuff all the way out if you can

524
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:40,880
like a castle a king a queen and a crowed i'm just straight up telling her what i remember

525
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,520
from the gameplay i think that's what she has to do right now

526
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,960
these they're like in separate rooms oh

527
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,960

528
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:11,440
i will embrace sweet death the eternal slumber in the name of the yetpricorn

529
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:28,560

531
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:50,320
her to do the guesswork what are you doing is this is this the castle um no you've pulled out

532
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,400
in a marriage arch way it looks like

533
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,960
i don't see anything else with a castle and except for those have you pulled the things all the way

534
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:13,360
out i actually see like half of a king it's ogre it's so ogre they'll have to admit this is probably

535
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,320
the heart oh you're pulling out people i see people

536
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,880

01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:32,000
then after moving north two times one can head for the door after taking one step towards the

700
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:42,560
western wall okay now let's digest this starting in the far west so go to the west side but don't

then after moving north two times one can head through the door after taking

708
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:44,160
one step towards the eastern wall. Go north two times. Is this gonna kill her? I'm getting

nervous. You got it? What's next? Fucking hell, you trying to make me calm? What the fuck?

That's right, but to come to a fucking walkie-talkie, what the fuck is this?

711
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:02,000
Right, one can head for the door after taking one step towards the dead west once.

712
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,920
There's gonna be more than vibrations coming through this damn walkie-talkie, the fuck?

01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:18,640
Now you can head to the door after the western step you did.

01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,000
Get that Queen in.

743
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,840
Get them Townsfolk in.

744
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,680
Yeah.

745
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,520
Is she laughing?

746
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,840
I think she's laughing.

747
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,240
Okay, Townspeople, Townspeople.

748
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,280
Bring them in, bring them in.

749
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:23,240
Hey, hey, hey, celebrate with the King and Queen.

750
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:25,880
More, more, more, more.

751
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,720
Show those peasants what they're missing out on.

752
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,560
Pill that scene.

753
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,600
Pill that scene.

754
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:36,920
Oh my God, we did it.

755
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:37,920
We did it.

756
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,560
King, Queen, that was Castle and Townspeople.

757
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,600
Okay, now let's find out what's happening in this next scene.

758
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,440
What's next?

759
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,640
Until the King killed all he could,

760
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,200
give me Evil King.

761
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,360
Put the good King away.

762
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,720
Boo, put the King away.

763
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,560
Boo.

764
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:00,200
We need Evil King now.

765
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,720
I don't know which one the King is.

766
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:10,160
Yep, perfect, perfect, all the way.

767
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,000
Get rid of that.

768
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:11,840
Boo.

769
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,840
Right, now we need Evil King out.

770
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,040
Evil King, Evil King.

771
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,080
Oh, here he comes.

772
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,600
Push, push, push him all the way out.

773
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,800
Perfect, perfect.

774
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,320
Oh, he's deranged, he's deranged.

775
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,720
Okay, now we need the bloodlights in the back.

776
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:28,360
You piss off, I'm working hard.

777
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,040
Okay, scene.

778
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:35,040
Until the King killed all he could.

779
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,880
Oh, he's crazy.

780
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,800
He's absolutely mental.

781
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:38,120
He's deranged.

782
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,120
Standing in blood, he probably said.

783
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,120
Standing in blood, he proudly said,

784
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:50,440
give me Blood King in Castle.

785
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,640
Maybe Blood King in Light,

786
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,080
and that's the Evil King in the Bloodlight.

787
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,440
I think that might be it.

788
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,280
Everyone away, Bloodlight on.

789
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:03,360
Okay, perfect, and Bloodlight on and scene.

790
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,080
No, no, that's the Bloodlight off, sorry.

791
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,680
Pop that bad boy back on.

792
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,120
And then pull scene.

793
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,320
Shit, you might need to bring out

794
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,640
the dead townspeople, I don't even know if that's possible.

795
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,480
He just says.

796
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,760
I don't think there's dead.

797
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:29,000
Oh, oh, oh, sorry, bring out the normal King again.

798
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,120
He just says standing in blood.

799
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,720
Maybe one, maybe, can you bring out

800
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,920
the Evil King any further?

801
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,600
Sorry, see if you can wind him out any further.

802
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,760
No, no, okay, maybe put Evil King away

803
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,960
and bring out normal King,

804
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,920
because he's just standing in blood, so with a Bloodlight.

805
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,120
What's the stage four?

806
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,640
Oh, I'm dying, ho ho ho, hurry up, Azura.

807
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:53,720
Hee hee, love you, love you, Mummy, please, sorry,

808
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,160
please don't let me die.

809
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:58,240
Okay, perfect, and then put away Evil King.

810
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go away, Evil King.

811
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,920
You stink, boo, boo, thumbs down.

812
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,800
Okay, pull scene.

813
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:10,960
You did it!

814
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:17,960
You did it, go down into the attic thing.

815
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,600
What the fuck was that noise, God damn.

816
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,800
Oh my God, that was a painful one I've dead met.

817
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,760
Hey, see me, hi.

818
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:32,760
You still have to talk to me through the walkie-talkie, though.

819
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:38,960
Oh my God, oh, your walkie-talkie's just hovering.

820
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:47,720
No, Azura, you might be the mother of all creations, okay?

821
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:54,040
Of all life on this earth, so it's you who must go on.

822
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:59,000
Go ahead, I will stand on the pressure plate

823
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,640
and you will get freedom that you deserve.

824
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,720
Your creations need you.

825
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:06,000
Go forth, Azura, into the snow.

826
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,360
What happened in you?

827
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,800
It is the sacrifice I must make, for I am a siren.

828
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,560
I take life, but you are the goddess of fertility you give.

829
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:22,440
Go on forth to humanity.

830
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,840
Give them the love they deserve.

831
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:29,120
She went.

832
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:29,960
No!

833
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,800
You did it.

834
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,920
Was there another way, question mark?

835
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:42,920
That was amazing, you did it, Azura.

836
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,880
Hee-hee-hee.

837
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:44,720
You did it!

838
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,880
You did it, that was fantastic, you did so well.

839
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,960
You were worried about nothing.

840
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,120
I don't think so.

841
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,480
It was good, you did fantastic.

842
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,320
Hee-hee-hee.

843
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,040
Wait, what did you think?

844
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,640
What did you think of that game type?

845
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:03,640
Yes or no?

846
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,480
I was, that was hard.

847
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,680
I'm not good at puzzles at all.

848
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:13,600
That, the last one was painful.

849
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,160
I have to admit, that was really hard to figure out.

850
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,400
Even, I've played the game before

851
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,480
and I kind of knew what you were doing on your end

852
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,120
and I still couldn't figure it out from the other perspective.

853
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,600
So don't feel dumb, that was hard.

854
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,000
It was hard as shit.

855
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,920
I think I should study chessboards more.

856
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:36,760
Well, I literally was calling the king, the queen at one point

857
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:39,040
and then Refleens were like, that's the king you moron.

858
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,200
I'm like, oh, okay, okay, I'll deal with it.

859
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,560
So don't worry about it, don't worry about it.

860
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:49,840
But there's like a whole series on the WiiWare here.

861
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,760
I think there's now four installments of the franchise.

862
01:37:55,840 --> 01:38:00,280
And for some reason, on the very last installment of this game,

863
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:04,400
they made it so unbelievably hard and difficult for no reason.

864
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,200
And all the other ones?

865
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:11,160
Yeah, so I've been lucky enough to play them

866
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,320
with other VTubers and another life team.

867
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:18,480
And the fourth installment is impossible without cheating.

868
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,960
I refuse to believe anyone naturally came up

869
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,600
with one of the answers in them.

870
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,200
But if you ever wanted to give another one a shot,

871
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,600
I'm right here, Azura.

872
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,960
But I don't know if puzzles are your thing.

873
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,240
Well, I don't know if they're your thing.

874
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,560
They're not my thing, I'm dumb.

875
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,360
Oh, that's adorable though, I loved it.

876
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,880
I'm sorry about scaring you about the monster in the maze.

877
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:50,320
I'm going to be honest, the monster can't get you in the maze.

878
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,360
I was just waning you up, I'm sorry.

879
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:59,000
That's what you get for waning me up in among us.

880
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,600
We were talking before the stream and she was like,

881
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,440
I purposely picked on you to hear that Scottish accent.

882
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:08,000
I'm like, Azura, you're not supposed to say that.

883
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,560
She's like, oh, because I was like,

884
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,320
oh, I don't get angry or frustrated.

885
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,680
And she was like, the among us club.

886
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:14,520
And I'm like, you know what?

887
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,720
You've actually got me there.

888
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,520
I got caught red.

889
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:17,640
You caught me.

890
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,960
You caught me.

891
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,520
You got me, I'm not going to lie.

892
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,480
It was funny.

893
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:26,960
Or you got so mad, she'd vote me off immediately.

894
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,440
And then I wasn't even the imposter and then she'd get.

895
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:34,160
I always, if someone, if anyone picks on me,

896
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,040
I'm like, instantly you're the imposter

897
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,720
because you're worried I'm going to snuff you out.

898
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,560
And then obviously I think I booted you off once

899
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:40,280
and you were innocent.

900
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,040
And then everyone was like, you're gilly strong.

901
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,400
And I'm like, no, no, Azura is starting then.

902
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,520
You started.

903
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,520
I'm going to end it.

904
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,400
I was so scared.

905
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,360
That was so good.

906
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:57,040
Thank you so much for playing with me and enjoyed myself

907
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:57,540
thoroughly.

908
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,840
Are you streaming after this or is that

909
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:00,840
you done for today?

910
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,920
Because I don't know if I should be direct into year or not.

911
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:04,960
I'm done for today.

912
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,480
I'm probably just going to chat with my stream for a little bit.

913
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:08,240
Yes, OK.

914
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,600
I say a little bit, but it's probably

915
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,120
going to be for like two hours.

916
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:14,080
They didn't call you yet for calling for nothing

917
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:15,360
around these parts.

918
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,960
OK, let me make sure I'm redirecting into year.

919
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,920
Because I don't want to not direct into year.

920
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:26,920
But that was so fun.

921
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:29,040
Please, if you ever wanted to play more of those,

922
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,680
I enjoy those games totally not because I've played them before

923
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:32,680
and they're not impossible.

924
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:34,360
Tee, tee.

925
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:37,800
If I played them fresh, I'd be a lot more nervous

926
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:43,120
because I'm like, um, but I think we did OK.

927
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:43,920
I was nervous.

928
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,600
You were going to get upset that I was so dumb.

929
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,840
No, I would never get upset at you for no good.

930
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,040
I mean, like, I was.

931
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:52,200
Don't get off the puzzle forever.

932
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:52,800
Oh, bro.

933
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,120
That last puzzle killed us.

934
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,200
Not going to lie.

935
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,080
Everything else.

936
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,560
I don't want this puzzle that I ever.

937
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:58,520
We blitzed through.

938
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,600
The longest puzzle.

939
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,600
The longest puzzle I've ever gotten stuck on

940
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,560
was like for literally two days straight.

941
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,440
And what?

942
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:09,760
I'd just cheat at that point.

943
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,040
It was.

944
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,840
I don't think you can cheat, though.

945
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,720
Like, yeah, you can cheat to find out what you have to do.

946
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

947
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,120
You have to actually time it.

948
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,520
It was like a timing puzzle.

949
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,360
And I could never get the timing, right?

950
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:27,080
No, I don't like that kind of stuff.

951
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:31,760
And apparently there's a game called Labyrinth Co-op Horror Puzzle.

952
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,000
I'm not sure if I can put the girls up for that.

953
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,160
I was freaking Azura pretending a slug was going to grab her.

954
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,440
I don't know how I should respond to a game like that.

955
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,640
I scream.

956
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,840
Terrible.

957
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:45,640
Right.

958
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,000
I am going to redirect into Azura,

959
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,120
because unfortunately I do have a few things to do today.

960
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:52,360
And thank you so, so much for playing me.

961
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:53,600
That was a hoot and a holler.

962
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,880
I'm going to redirect into you.

963
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,480
Reeflings, be lovely to the bleeding hearts.

964
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:58,240
I'm bleeding hearts.

965
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:01,640
Thanks for having me as well on your end of things, Azura.

966
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:02,840
I will redirect into you.

967
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,000
Thank you so, so much.

968
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,560
I give everyone kisses.

969
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,240
And I'm going to dissipate, okay?

970
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:10,360
I'm going to dissipate.

971
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,720
I'm going to jump out of voice chat first,

972
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,800
because Azura is going to be like, bruh.

973
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,040
She's going to be like, bruh, what's going on here?

974
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,040
Okay.

975
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:17,880
All right, I take off.

976
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:18,720
Bye-bye, guys.

977
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:19,760
Bye.

978
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,760
Bye-bye.

979
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,760
Bye.

980
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:22,760
Bye.
