zora is that a zero can you hear is this thing are you enjoying it are you having fun is there uh yeah i didn't know really it's a reactive mimosa's ears are they are yeah they are they're all well rigged um and her boobs too i know i can't stop sharing everyone's boobs i don't understand in comparison they're actually i have like really bad eyes though so sometimes mimosa's arms look like a part of her hair yeah she looks like a little nuggie i love it her arms are very thin so they tend to kind of disappear into her hair for sure her she's she's our little nugget my little nugget now i want chicken nuggets oh my god i had really good chicken nuggets yesterday i know this is completely off topic but it's fucking delicious i was like oh i always eat you i have bad eyes this is not an excuse to stare at boobs let me alone oh get it get it get it get it this is so hate yeah mimosa's voice dinner her mouth tracking is really good nothing wrong with wanting some strawberry milk get out of here so my question is are they doing a five-man song at the end i bet i hope they do yeah i'm getting i wonder if they'll do like an original song yeah that would be crazy some people we should do an original song yeah they're like why did veeler not do an original song oh i brought it stressful and i was trying to debut last thing i want to do is give them a custom song that like to try and do but if you guys want to like we should all have an original we should have an a group song that's an original okay i'll do the male part of the song because my voice can have that i'll do the rap part of the song i'll do the backup vocals that leaves azura and mercy and icy perfect we're good yeah they can carry us through the through the actual vocals exactly i'll just do the yeah oh adlibs oh he was adlib everything let's get it veeler mommy right now taking notes honestly bro i'm spamming their dms i'm like how long did that fucking take you're supposed to take a week we maybe

i feel like i would recognize it if it was a twice song but i guess i'm a fake twice fan name this particular members grandmother's maiden name right now oh i'm getting tingles this is awesome oh my god can someone tell me what song this is it's kda apparently okay that makes more sense oh it's kda yeah it's kda i mean why did somebody say it was twice why are you lying oh it's i'll show you by kda and twice okay my cat oh okay what are you doing what song for league of legends oh well that's azura fucking happy uh she's probably geeking out right now hold on i want to go to her stream i'm
