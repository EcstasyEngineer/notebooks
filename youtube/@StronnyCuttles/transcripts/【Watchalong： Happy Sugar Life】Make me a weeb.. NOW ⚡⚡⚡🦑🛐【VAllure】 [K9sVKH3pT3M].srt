1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
do you have like a little 50 second wonder where I can talk to myself?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
oh why not some stock in my head

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I haven't even partaken in hot pants

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
oh cheers

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
oh

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
oh

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
only ink, no cute real auntie

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the sun's getting real low

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you guys sound like Bruce Banner

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
hi

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
are we there?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
did I hear myself double echoing?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
there better not be a triple echo in here

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
mommmy

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
good morning good evening good afternoon

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we are doing something very special

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
because in my two months of streaming so far

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I've never done one a public watch along

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and two a watch along of an anime

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm gonna be a certified weev after this

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
not one of yous can call me a fake anime fan after this session

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
no I have watched some anime

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
don't get me wrong I have

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've seen like Attack on Titan season one

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
season one of my hero academia nuts

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
all that kind of thing

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
how's your service?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
it's good

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
it's not sore today

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
we're gonna be traumatized from this fuck

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
right the reason we are watching happy sugar life

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is because

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
drumroll please

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
it's a 12 episode anime

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
which means we can watch it all in one day

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
which is what I was aiming for

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
so we're gonna be sitting on our tushies

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
for about six hours today

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
how's your zip?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
oh my zipple

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
my zipple's okay

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
it did exactly as I suggested

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
so there's a red outline from where it broke

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
in quotation marks

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the zip for broke

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and I've already been traumatized from this

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
fake gamer, fake weave, fake streamer, fake everything

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
even chats, pre-recorded

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
literally the streams are pre-made

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
everything's pre-made

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it's a great show

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
well we're about to find out

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I have my cup of tea

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was going to ramble

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was gonna ramble

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will go back in this stream

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and timestamp exactly when the episode starts

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
let's be honest

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm a bit of a rambler

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
come on now

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
it's me

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
a yug hut me

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I only do this for male attention

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you're absolutely correct

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
why do you think I only use he, him

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
in my scripts?

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
he made da males

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
ink right now

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have a refling that sits on my chest

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
during watch-alongs

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
cause I always have a refling with me

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
you will talk a lot during that

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
so we are

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
watching

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
sub

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
titles

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
sub titles

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
so first before we start

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
arguing

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
subs vs. dubs

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I couldn't get less of a shite

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
you know what it's getting

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it's getting

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Xbox vs. Playstation fans

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
or subs vs. dubs

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
oh

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
oh but with sub titles

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you get to listen to the real anime words

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
oh and the passion and the voice

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
oh right ok ok

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
oh but if you listen to

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
shut up

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
let people enjoy things that they enjoy

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
ok

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
how about that

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
how about that

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
how about let people enjoy what they want to enjoy

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
if someone is too tired to read sub titles

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
during an entire episode

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
or an entire series

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
god forbid they listen to the english dub

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
god forbid

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
forbidden

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
it's actually the 11th commandment

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
on the back side of the tablet

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
when moses came down that hill

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and he went

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you know he said

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
thou shalt not kill

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
thou shalt not da da da

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and then actually there was a secret one

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
on the back of the tablet

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and it said

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
thou shalt not

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
a fucking great

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
when someone debates on

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
sub vs. dubs when it comes to anime

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and then in quotation

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
in brackets pardon me

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
it said

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
you'll understand this in about 2,000 years time

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know what to say

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know what to say

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
let people enjoy

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
thanks gade

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but the dub says

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
27 minutes ago

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I recently said

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
on marshmallow

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I command the

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
sleautistic pog

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
waifu

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
love heart

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
no that's not a good thing

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
starney don't you know

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
you lose

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
your weeb card

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
when you watch sub

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
for fuck's sake

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and he's more rules

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
fuck's sake there's a 12th commandment

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
oh sorry

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
let me get the commandment back out again

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
and then moza said

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
right there's a 12th commandment mate

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and he goes

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
there's actually a secret hidden room

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and if you do watch in dubs

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
you'll lose what's known as your weeb card

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
again you're gonna understand this in about

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
2,000 years time

158
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and then everyone in the town

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
slash village was like

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
what the fuck is he on about

161
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
but anyway

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
they just let it happen ok

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I mean

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
shit that's

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
most of the history

166
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
most of the history is like

167
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
let it happen

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and then until it becomes a real problem

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and now it's became a real problem

170
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
2,000 years later

171
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
go down

172
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
eh

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I already have mild autism

174
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
please don't make it severe

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
you're gonna be bouncing off of me

177
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
like I'm bouncing off your cheeks tonight

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
actually you have to watch raw

179
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
with no subs

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and no understanding

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the only thing I'm gonna understand is

182
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
don't

183
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
don't

184
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
alright my voice is so cracked this morning

185
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
eh

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
ooh 2 hours ago

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
hi Sturney, how are you feeling?

188
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
just a suggestion for the anime watch belongs

189
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but can we make sure we take breaks of the 3-4 episodes

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you want a break every 4 episodes deal

191
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you're on I'll go stretch

192
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
haha

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
that's literally my only experience

194
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is straight up like fan service anime

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and no

196
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't care if you don't count

197
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
monster misumi

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
as a real anime

199
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't give

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't give a rat's arse

201
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
okay it's a good series

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I thoroughly enjoyed it

203
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
papi

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and gen 4 confirmed

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't care what anyone says

210
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
monster misumi is based

211
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't care if anyone says

212
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
eh

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
papi's flat chested

214
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
that's weird

215
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I kill you

216
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000

218
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
play minecraft in survival mode

219
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000

220
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000

221
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000

228
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
lol

229
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
strongly bringing our inner anime

230
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
real and true

231
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
mama going off today

232
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
sorry I'm like

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am both exhausted

234
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I got 8 hours

235
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think

236
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
roughly

237
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't know

238
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I forgot to eat yesterday

239
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and I basically ate a handful of crisps

240
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and then I had two scoops of like

241
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
pre-made pasta

242
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
what else did I have

243
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I had

244
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
a chug jug

245
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
of fruit juice

246
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
there's like

247
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
a glass of fruit

248
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
that has like all these

249
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
blended up

250
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
super healthy for me

251
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
eh

252
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and a cheese string

253
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
because I forgot to eat

254
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
right before I slept

255
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and I was like

256
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know

257
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
how I forgot to

258
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
ehm

259
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
eat

260
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
because normally food's

261
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
on my mind all the time

262
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm one really good

263
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
you know

264
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
ehm

265
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it's a pretty easy guess

266
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
we'll eat food in two

267
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
two minutes chose

268
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
okay

269
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm gonna keep

270
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
rambling

271
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that's right

272
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
what's that you're

273
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you're eagerly

274
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
awaiting to press

275
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
play

276
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
on the episode

277
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
no fucking

278
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm having a tea first

279
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
okay

280
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you had too much ink

281
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
ehm

282
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
hey moment

283
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
sorry for dup question

284
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
oh my god I can't believe it

285
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you have the audacity

286
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to ask me a question

287
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
you're more than allowed

288
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to ask it

289
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
please don't ever feel bad

290
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
if you ask a question

291
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've answered before

292
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it is impossible for you

293
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to literally

294
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
watch and consume

295
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
all of my content

296
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
all at once

297
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm so sorry

298
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
but it is impossible

299
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I get comments

300
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
from like

301
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
vods gone by

302
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and they're like

303
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm so glad I finally

304
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
caught up with this stream

305
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and it was like

306
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
a month ago

307
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and I'm like

308
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
oh I feel so bad

309
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
like I've produced

310
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
too much content

311
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
to keep up with

312
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you literally

313
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
have the times to

314
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
the content

315
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to keep up mildly

316
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
ehm

317
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you've seen this in her wit

318
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
some refling something

319
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that looks like a challenge

320
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
except keep yapping

321
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm having internet

322
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000

323
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000

326
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that is attached

328
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
to your credit card

329
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000

333
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000

how dare you

338
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
produce too much content

339
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't believe it

340
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the value you get

341
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
from around these parts

342
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000

board game

394
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
now introducing

395
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the lifestyle

396
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
of YouTubers

397
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Droneiko

398
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
cause I literally

399
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
take up all your time

400
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
unfortunately I don't

401
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
have enough time

402
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
to watch every

403
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
the new stream

404
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
as I said

405
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
it is not

406
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
it is not possible

407
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
in French

408
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
it is not possible

409
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
no no

410
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
sir

411
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
it is not possible

412
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that is not how you say that

413
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
sense

414
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think it's

415
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
impossible

416
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it's just probably

417
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
not correct either

418
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
sorry Emmy

419
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
if you heard that

420
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
my apologies

421
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Emmy

422
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
sorry

423
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I love this anime

424
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
so much

425
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I've been looking forward to this

426
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
watch along

427
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
ah it's my first one

428
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm glad you like it

429
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I was surprised you guys

430
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
knew the name of it

431
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but then at the same time

432
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I chose me

433
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I picked a decent one

434
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
cause it got recommended

435
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
for being so short

436
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
hey beautiful

437
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
just wanted

438
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
to let you know

439
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the urge to commission art

440
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
of you

441
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
tied

442
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to

443
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
override

444
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
the need for not dying

445
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because I

446
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
unwillingly spent money

447
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
on a road trip

448
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
with my

449
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
fiance on our

450
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
anniversary

451
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it's coming up

452
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the guy I want to commission

453
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
does excellent

454
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
pair of bodies

455
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will see you

456
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
in spaz

457
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
what's spaz

458
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
also congrats

459
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
on your anniversary

460
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
what the heck

461
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
spaz

462
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
spaz

463
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
a shortening of

464
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
spatter dashes

465
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
or spatter guards

466
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
or a type of footwear

467
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
accessory

468
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
for outdoor wear

469
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
covering the instep

470
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and the ankle

471
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
well

472
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm commissioning a girl

473
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
to have that

474
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
what the heck

475
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
spaz

476
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000

479
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
anniversary though

480
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
make sure you spend it on

481
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
you don't have to spoil me

482
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I commissioned

483
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
something really degenerate

484
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
of me and my gen mates

485
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
already

486
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I've got you covered

487
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I assure you

491
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
spaz are like

492
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000

I don't find much

507
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
drawing many things these days

508
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but I've been enjoying

509
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
you and me allure

510
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000

524
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000

this riflin's talking

528
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
about gen 2

529
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000

530
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
do not hire a singer

533
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
for your next gen

534
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
ok ok

535
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
they always put the least

536
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
amount of effort

537
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
into their live streams

538
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and when making scripted

539
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
content

540
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
they phone it in

541
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm not sure what they

542
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
phone it in

543
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
they like to act tough

544
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
but are just self important

545
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
it cannot

546
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
improv

547
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
or handle criticism

548
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
to save their lives

549
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
to the surprise of no one

550
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
they grow to dislike

551
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
their companies

552
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
fans in their own

553
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and that one

554
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
guy

555
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
more than anyone

556
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
in the business

557
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
but nothing compares

558
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
what is this about

559
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
phone it in

560
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
means minimal effort

561
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
oh you're teaching me

562
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
you're teaching me things

563
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I love being educated

564
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I mean he's kind of cooking

565
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
this is so specific

566
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
wait is this specific

567
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
what does that mean

568
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I must

569
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
wait am I not allowed to

570
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
say this out loud

571
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
what the sigma

572
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
am I saying something

573
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the things are even

574
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
remotely passionate about

575
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in brackets male singers

576
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
are not even close to

577
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
the kind of veal

578
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
or seeks to make

579
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
wait does someone make

580
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
a statement that they

581
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
wanted to join us or something

582
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
if a singer

583
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
auditions for veal

584
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
or it means she's looking for

585
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
a simp farm to buy

586
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
then her

587
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
comicale

588
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
expensive

589
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
dream microphone

590
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and some other gear

591
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
she'll need to fill you

592
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
herself

593
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
he's being extremely

594
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
specific

595
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
oh no there's something

596
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know about

597
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm getting

598
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
the tea

599
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
oh I literally have the tea

600
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
whilst I'm getting the tea

601
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
okay my apologies

602
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm just reading

603
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm just reading

604
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm just reading what I was saying

605
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
okay

606
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
look I hear all the reeflings

607
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
here I don't care

608
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
the reeflings are allowed to

609
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
vouch

610
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't care if you call out

611
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
favoritism

612
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the reeflings are allowed to

613
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
vouch

614
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't give a shit

615
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I love my reeflings

616
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
full stop

617
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
my reeflings love me

618
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
full stop

619
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
it is a good bloody life

620
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
together

621
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry I don't care

622
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
if anyone's like

623
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you shouldn't let the reefling

624
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
conform to

625
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
actually the reeflings

626
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
for the whole reason

627
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
so maybe I will let them

628
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
influence me

629
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll let them influence me

630
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
all the way up into my cervix

631
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
so

632
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
hope your nip naps heal

633
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
well

634
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000

638
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
perpetual cycle

639
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000

640
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000

the three bases

645
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
you boil them

646
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
you mash them

647
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
you stick them in

648
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
okay

649
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000

651
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000

653
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000

654
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000

655
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
get pampered

656
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
hi strongy

657
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
you brought up dub versus sub

658
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I just want to give you

659
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
some background

660
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
okay we're getting some

661
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
history

662
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
old dub used to be awful

663
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
like genuinely bad

664
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
these days

665
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
they aren't so bad

666
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
but some og sands

667
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
might have ptsd

668
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
from those days

669
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
og sands

670
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
can we confirm

671
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that your

672
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
dubs were

673
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
absolutely abysmal

674
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
back in the day

675
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
very

676
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
comfortable

677
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
okay I'm going to finish this team

678
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
we'll get ready to go

679
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
so can you grab things

680
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
now with a left nip

681
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
don't speak

682
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
for the next 10 seconds

683
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
it's healing

684
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
it's gone straight back

685
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
to exactly where

686
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
it was supposed to be

687
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
and I thought

688
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
that's exactly what would happen

689
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
because of the healing properties

690
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
of the area

691
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
nah

692
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
mad build out for dub

693
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
was great I suppose

694
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
so

695
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
you're older than me

696
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you wouldn't let me

697
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
take advantage of you

698
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
no no

699
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
she melts the guys

700
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
in the morning

701
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
german dubs are mostly

702
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
pretty good

703
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
hello loiter

704
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
about skips

705
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
what would a german anime

706
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
sound like

707
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
ishbin

708
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
ishbin crying

709
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
little sister

710
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't know

711
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
how to shove that together

712
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
cause you know how the anime

713
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
almost has a light voice

714
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
when you tell him

715
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm so sorry

716
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I didn't mean to

717
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
spill that coffee

718
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
one more

719
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
please let me

720
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
clean it up

721
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
oh yeah

722
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
you like that

723
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
mommy when you were a child

724
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
did you like

725
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
scottish dubbing

726
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm so sorry

727
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
but that's not a thing

728
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Scotland Dubs gets put in

729
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
the gutter

730
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
there's no such thing as

731
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
scottish dub

732
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
cause they never make it

733
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
ishbin

734
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I am your little sister

735
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
ishbin

736
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
as a german don't

737
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
ever mention

738
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
german dub again

739
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Shawnee should do a stream

740
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
where you dub over

741
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
some anime

742
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
is my style

743
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but that's not

744
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
what I'm saying

745
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't care what you're saying

746
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I just become toad

747
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Scottish dub

748
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
it would literally be like

749
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
a candy date captain

750
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
it's a dilifium

751
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
crystals captain

752
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
they're just candy dates

753
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
people

754
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
people die

755
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
when they're killed

756
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but be

757
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
what

758
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
but big brother

759
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I put from there

760
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
now hold on a minute

761
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
okay one kiss for you I guess

762
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I came out of nowhere

763
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
erin

764
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
oh you won the scottish version

765
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
of that

766
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
erin

767
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
we gotta get to the basement

768
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
sounded like toadstool from mario

769
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I used to too

770
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
are you trying to

771
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
can't wait for you to

772
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
put the suppository in me

773
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
okay I don't want to

774
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
put the suppository in me

775
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
okay

776
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't care what anyone says

777
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
suppository

778
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
then ties are the best

779
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the way you pronounce it

780
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
it sounded like you said

781
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I am your little sweater

782
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
like sweat

783
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I need a brush up on my German

784
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I didn't realize how many German

785
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
reeflings there are

786
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000

787
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000

Mushy-mushy.

1119
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:45,200
Oh, there's a normal person in this anime.

1120
01:09:45,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Don't worry, it gets a lot worse than this.

1121
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:29,200
Oh.

1122
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:39,200
Hmm.

1123
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:47,200
What this?

1124
01:10:47,200 --> 01:11:05,200
How can I keep up?

1125
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:15,200
Nope.

1126
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Oh, our paths are crossing, but not the good canes.

1127
01:11:37,200 --> 01:12:05,200
Ah.

1128
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:17,200
Yeah, I'm a bit too late.

1129
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:25,200
Hmm.

1130
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:53,200
Uh.

1131
01:12:53,200 --> 01:13:05,200
Did she do it?

1132
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,200
I should do it?

1133
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:17,200
Monko? Well, fucking rival already ended. Hold on, let me do it.

1134
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:21,200
Oh my gosh, she keeps saying the n-word.

1135
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:27,200
Okay, okay, okay, go next, go next.

1136
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:37,200
I'm ready when you are.

1137
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:45,200
Okay, are we all ready for the next episode already? Yes.

1138
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,200
I love that she's hooked, you ready? Okay, always on go.

1139
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:57,200
Three, two, one, go.

1140
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:07,200
Also, the last scene being a crowbar, freaking splat.

1141
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:19,200
The next anime we were- I really like that. Like, is it hook? I think it's called hook in a song.

1142
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:31,200
The next anime we were going to watch was Vibe something I was the plan.

1143
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:37,200
Is the next anime in English? I have no idea. I don't know if it's got a dub or a sub.

1144
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:43,200
I thought all the anime ended up with a dub or a sub, but I was mistaken.

1145
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:55,200
Vibe, aye.

1146
01:14:55,200 --> 01:15:01,200
Shawnee, Riplin. They can't dub 400 anime every year.

1147
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:09,200
That's it, I'm going to Japan to learn Japanese and then I'll dub everyone.

1148
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,200
And then when I need to play the yandere, you disgust me.

1149
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:19,200
But it's just my Scottish accent. You disgust me. You're absolutely filthy.

1150
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:27,200
You don't touch me. You think you stand a chance when I have you? When I have you?

1151
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:45,200
Okay, okay, okay, what happened? What happened?

1152
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:54,200
She's certainly got the murder eyes on.

1153
01:15:54,200 --> 01:16:07,200
Oh, to be murdered at 8 minutes past 9 at night.

1154
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:13,200
Can't be friends with the Scottish accent.

1155
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:21,200
The dread's setting in.

1156
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:33,200
Oh no, she's having a panic attack.

1157
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:57,200
And she can't get out.

1158
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:13,200
She's been hurt.

1159
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:19,200
She's been haunted?

1160
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:30,200
Uh oh.

1161
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:38,200
You are disgusting.

1162
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:52,200
As if she knows the location of the maid cafe.

1163
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,200
Hen. I thought it was a girl.

1164
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,200
Hen. He.

1165
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:20,200
She's quick with it.

1166
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:20,200
When the Elden Ring lightens this.

1167
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:37,200
Sorry for dirtying your sofa.

1168
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:46,200
Oh, well, she's not giving up where she's living either.

1169
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:56,200
Tai Yu means fun. She did a bad man. She already ghosted.

1170
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:17,200
She's got quite the color scheme, pink, blue, green, red, white, a little bit of brown.

1171
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:41,200
Oh my god, we're in the sea.

1172
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:52,200
Hmm.

1173
01:20:52,200 --> 01:21:05,200
Stop. I'm so immature. I'm so immature.

1174
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:31,200
I'm so immature.

1175
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:48,200
And what you love will turn to ashes. Hey, what's so bad about ink?

1176
01:21:48,200 --> 01:22:17,200
What? She's happy to be jealous?

1177
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:42,200
What?

1178
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:47,200
Happy sugar license. She said it, she said the phrase.

1179
01:22:47,200 --> 01:23:11,200
Is he about to find her?

1180
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:18,200
Why are you sniffing the paper girl? She's about to go home to an empty apartment.

1181
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:38,200
She's about to lose it. No doubt in my mind she's about to lose it.

1182
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:46,200
She has a lovely long hair.

1183
01:23:46,200 --> 01:24:02,200
I don't doubt it. I actually don't doubt her words.

1184
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:12,200
Oh no.

1185
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:23,200
Senor.

1186
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:43,200
Oh no.

1187
01:24:43,200 --> 01:25:03,200
Oh my god.

1188
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:24,200
That moment she knew. She.

1189
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Yes.

1190
01:25:54,200 --> 01:26:21,200
Yeah, it's abuse of parents.

1191
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:42,200
Monka.

1192
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:52,200
This anime was going to be, it's not what I expected.

1193
01:26:52,200 --> 01:27:02,200
What my fridge sees at 3am?

1194
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,200
Oh no.

1195
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:18,200
She's too scared to move.

1196
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,200
You thought happy sugar life was going to be a cute story?

1197
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:29,200
Kindle, yeah, I mean the title was very misleading.

1198
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:33,200
So she horny because she can't get it, don't you?

1199
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:11,200
That'll pass though.

1200
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:24,200
Oh, I almost got to see you, see?

1201
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:52,200
Uh, who did we get grabbed by?

1202
01:28:52,200 --> 01:29:01,200
No.

1203
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:08,200
Oh no.

1204
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:20,200
No, I don't like this.

1205
01:29:38,200 --> 01:30:02,200
Uh-huh.

1206
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:53,200
Dobby beef, poby beef, poby beef in Japan, sorry.

1207
01:30:53,200 --> 01:31:06,200
What the hell is that confession?

1208
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:23,200
That was so everywhere, sorry.

1209
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:29,200
The milk traumatized them so much, it became a loliko.

1210
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:42,200
You'll enter.

1211
01:31:42,200 --> 01:32:11,200
Monka.

1212
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:34,200
I don't like that.

1213
01:32:34,200 --> 01:33:03,200
And there are no churches.

1214
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:23,200
Hmm.

1215
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:45,200
I said it was worse, she just doesn't drew.

1216
01:33:45,200 --> 01:34:12,200
Is it actually?

1217
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:22,200
Oh my god.

1218
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:47,200
Uh.

1219
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:59,200
Cold happy sugar life, by the way.

1220
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:05,200
Yakutsa?

1221
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:24,200
Uh, Yakutsa question mark.

1222
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:33,200
Dobby Vivon, please.

1223
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,200
Monka, Monka, Monka.

1224
01:35:54,200 --> 01:36:21,200
Wait, she went.

1225
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:28,200
Her mom used to get hit in front of her and she saw all of it.

1226
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:31,200
Her mom protected her through it all.

1227
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:36,200
Is Okasa dead?

1228
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:42,200
Bruh, don't end the episode there, what the fuck?

1229
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,200
We're bombing into four, oh my god.

1230
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:51,200
So Okasa used to get absolutely walloped right in front of her.

1231
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,200
Hold on, go next, sorry.

1232
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:57,200
We'll take a pause after this one, promise, but oh my god, we need to go next.

1233
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:58,200
We need to go next, right.

1234
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:03,200
We're on episode four, happy sugar life.

1235
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Okay, you ready?

1236
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,200
Three, two, one, go.

1237
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:14,200
And then I promise we'll take a break after this one, we'll get some food, we'll get some drinks.

1238
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:25,200
Bruh, I need to know.

1239
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:30,200
You're not ready for the family war?

1240
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:47,200
So mom used to get walloped and she can't handle the sight of blood.

1241
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:53,200
Did she used to get hit?

1242
01:37:53,200 --> 01:38:04,200
And then her mom's freaking ghost is looking after her.

1243
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:10,200
Does the mom understand that the yandere is probably her best safety bit?

1244
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,200
Oh shit!

1245
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:40,200
What?

1246
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,200
Can she catch a wee break?

1247
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:47,200
What?

1248
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:52,200
Her mom's spirit is gaging her.

1249
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,200
Her mom protected her.

1250
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:58,200
Her mom's spirit, I will never forgive you.

1251
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,200
You let go of my hand.

1252
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,200
What?

1253
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:08,200
She's a baby, this is no fair.

1254
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:12,200
Oh my god.

1255
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,200
The urge to skip the opening?

1256
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:16,200
I know, just so we can learn.

1257
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:20,200
I'll leave it, I'll appreciate it for what it's worth.

1258
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:29,200
I actually quite like this, it's pretty good.

1259
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:55,200
The opening is such a contrast.

1260
01:40:56,200 --> 01:41:10,200
Don't pillar by the hair.

1261
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:25,200
Oh fuck.

1262
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:51,200
Oh my god.

1263
01:41:51,200 --> 01:42:12,200
He's doing the knee thing.

1264
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:30,200
Oh she didn't kill, okay, just meme.

1265
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:55,200
Oh my god.

1266
01:42:55,200 --> 01:43:11,200
Oh my god.

1267
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:38,200
Oh, and the plot second is now he knows that we have Shio-chan.

1268
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:59,200
Oh yeah.

1269
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:11,200
She's not feeling well.

1270
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:54,200
Smells like Sato-chan and oddly like iron.

1271
01:44:54,200 --> 01:45:10,200
Oh my god.

1272
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:31,200
Okay, okay, we're together again, that's a good part.

1273
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:46,200
But that certainly ramped things up in the end.

1274
01:45:46,200 --> 01:46:08,200
Oh.

1275
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:29,200
Our aunt was a Yandere and told her the ways.

1276
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:33,200
I don't think I've ever seen a plot like that before.

1277
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:41,200
Yandere runs in the blood.

1278
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:47,200
Is she gonna lulker the fucking?

1279
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:56,200
I don't know some shitty aftercare.

1280
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:10,200
Yandere runs in the family.

1281
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:16,200
Tomahawk.

1282
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:29,200
I tried miso soup from a Japanese takeaway, it was bogan.

1283
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:34,200
Itadakimasu.

1284
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:45,200
Oishii desu.

1285
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:52,200
Yup.

1286
01:47:52,200 --> 01:48:04,200
Oh, that's a fiver.

1287
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:19,200
That's a fiver.

1288
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:41,200
Oh.

1289
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:51,200
Oh.

1290
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:54,200
Locks her in.

1291
01:48:54,200 --> 01:49:00,200
That was a fire.

1292
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:07,200
Can he lock some boots even?

1293
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:08,200
Oh, she said it!

1294
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:20,200
That's like the third time now, we are winning.

1295
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,200
Is she even happy?

1296
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:28,200
I don't think she was happy.

1297
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:52,200
We've got bank.

1298
01:49:52,200 --> 01:50:00,200
Oh, Senpai. I forgot Senpai was technically on her side.

1299
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:15,200
I should go after him? What the fuck?

1300
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:24,200
That's not tickling, that's not tickling, I don't know about you, but that doesn't look like a tickle to me.

1301
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:37,200
Ain't no pickle being tickled in there.

1302
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:43,200
Oh, Senpai is scared of us.

1303
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:49,200
Senpai is kohai.

1304
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:55,200
Oh, you better not be causing us bother.

1305
01:50:55,200 --> 01:51:04,200
Can he speak to the ant?

1306
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:14,200
Is the ant the trash?

1307
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:18,200
Oh wait, it's clicking.

1308
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:27,200
Was the trash her ant?

1309
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:32,200
So she could live together with Saito because she couldn't get.

1310
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:48,200
Oh no.

1311
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:50,200
The plot tickled.

1312
01:51:50,200 --> 01:52:05,200
I know we need to take a break after this one.

1313
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:15,200
Can we get another show? I'm done for another show scene in the alleyway, that's the long saying in the street.

1314
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:30,200
You all hate to take a break, I'll make the quickest, never make taking a quicker break.

1315
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:38,200
She took both their eyes.

1316
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:58,200
You know, when you have optics or eyeballs.

1317
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:06,200
I had to sew something there.

1318
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:17,200
Seifu.

1319
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:33,200
Seifu.

1320
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:43,200
Morning.

1321
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:52,200
Yandere's gonna have something they value.

1322
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:57,200
Watashi wa the dangeru.

1323
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,200
Yumi means dream.

1324
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,200
Yumi plus.

1325
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:50,200
He's obsessed now though, because he got to see her.

1326
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:53,200
He's losing it.

1327
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:58,200
He's drilling.

1328
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:04,200
Imagine going to see your son's room and see that on the wall.

1329
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:09,200
What in the Emmy is your name on YouTube and profile picture?

1330
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:12,200
I've actually seen that anime.

1331
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,200
I don't care what anyone says it was a good anime.

1332
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:34,200
Shoot me.

1333
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:36,200
I don't feel privacy.

1334
01:55:36,200 --> 01:55:46,200
When I was with my parents they didn't give a shit what I was doing.

1335
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,200
What anime?

1336
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:52,200
It's like my little sister can't be this cute or something.

1337
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,200
They both got blonde hair.

1338
01:55:54,200 --> 01:56:02,200
And she's like into Auroge.

1339
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:04,200
She's not happy.

1340
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,200
She's only right.

1341
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:31,200
She's only happy when she shows up, but she's not actually happy.

1342
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:45,200
Really?

1343
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:52,200
Ero manga sensei is 12 episodes 2.

1344
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,200
Whoa!

1345
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:57,200
I look away for one second and read the first subtitle.

1346
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,200
What?

1347
01:56:59,200 --> 01:57:04,200
Am I going mental?

1348
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:07,200
I look away for one second and the subtitle goes,

1349
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,200
oh my tits will go back to normal.

1350
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:17,200
Alright then.

1351
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:23,200
I missed the first part too.

1352
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,200
Oh my god!

1353
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,200
She's an architect!

1354
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,200
I can't believe it.

1355
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:42,200
Same.

1356
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,200
It's all in the seats.

1357
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:50,200
All.

1358
01:57:50,200 --> 01:58:03,200
Don't you start and start and start?

1359
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:09,200
She washes.

1360
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:34,200
Is it an apartment already, Felix?

1361
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:45,200
Okay, that makes sense.

1362
01:58:45,200 --> 01:58:53,200
Whoa!

1363
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:57,200
1.2 million yen.

1364
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:00,200
Is it, I think if you think...

1365
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:04,200
$12,000 or something?

1366
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:06,200
Oh, we know the yen and the dollar completely changed

1367
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:16,200
I wonder.

1368
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:18,200
She really is being haunted.

1369
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:20,200
What the fuck?

1370
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:25,200
She's drawing the damn thing, Snow!

1371
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:29,200
Walk, you know.

1372
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,200
I'll open up five, but we're going to take a quick break

1373
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,200
and grab some food and snacks.

1374
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:35,200
Oh my god, this anime is bizarre.

1375
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:38,200
It's Byzantine Empire.

1376
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:41,200
It's $8,000.

1377
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,200
I mean, she's working hard.

1378
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:50,200
I heard in Japan how you call it.

1379
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:54,200
It's different.

1380
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:59,200
Don't read this out loud!

1381
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:04,200
Oh my god.

1382
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:15,200
There's a post-credits scene.

1383
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:18,200
I hate when animes do that.

1384
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:20,200
Just fucking...

1385
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:24,200
Post-credits scene.

1386
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,200
Okay, hold on.

1387
02:00:26,200 --> 02:00:28,200
Sorry, we're back on episode 4.

1388
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:30,200
I hate when animes do the fucking credits

1389
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,200
and then a post-credits scene.

1390
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:33,200
Fuck up!

1391
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:36,200
Where the credits last!

1392
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:39,200
Right, I am on the credits

1393
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:44,200
where it's the two rings out of a pot that's broken.

1394
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,200
There are a lot of post-credits scenes.

1395
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,200
Nope, that's it.

1396
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:48,200
You're getting put in the bin.

1397
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:50,200
Any anime that does that is getting put in the bin.

1398
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,200
In the bin.

1399
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:52,200
You're out there.

1400
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:54,200
Let me skipity-boo the intro

1401
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,200
and let me skipity-boo the outro

1402
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:58,200
and just watch the thing.

1403
02:00:58,200 --> 02:00:59,200
Controversial take.

1404
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:00,200
Right.

1405
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:04,200
Is everyone on the rings in the jar in episode 4?

1406
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:06,200
Everyone on the rings in the jar.

1407
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,200
Rings in the jar.

1408
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:08,200
Rings in the jar.

1409
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:09,200
Oh yeah.

1410
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:10,200
Rings in the jar.

1411
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:11,200
She hates happy to realize.

1412
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:12,200
Okay.

1413
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:13,200
Right.

1414
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:14,200
Rings in the jar.

1415
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,200
Broken.

1416
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:16,200
Episode 4.

1417
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,200
Credits scene.

1418
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:18,200
Okay.

1419
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:20,200
Three, two, one.

1420
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,200
Go.

1421
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,200
What piano plan?

1422
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,200
Oh.

1423
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,200
Oh.

1424
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:25,200
Kawaii Disney piano plan.

1425
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,200
Oh.

1426
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:27,200
We're at the cafe.

1427
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,200
Right.

1428
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:30,200
I promise I won't skip the next one.

1429
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:32,200
Se aijou.

1430
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:35,200
Blinding light.

1431
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:37,200
Pants.

1432
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:43,200
Hello?

1433
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:47,200
Oh no.

1434
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,200
Another one.

1435
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,200
No.

1436
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:52,200
Another one.

1437
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:53,200
Another one.

1438
02:01:53,200 --> 02:01:56,200
No.

1439
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:57,200
No.

1440
02:01:57,200 --> 02:02:03,200
Those who violate love must pay the price.

1441
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:08,200
Such a sin can only be atoned for with punishment.

1442
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:11,200
The taste of crime and the taste of punishment.

1443
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:12,200
Episode 5.

1444
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,200
Oh my god.

1445
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:15,200
Can we catch a break?

1446
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:17,200
Can we catch a break?

1447
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:19,200
Can we catch a break?

1448
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:20,200
Can we catch a break?

1449
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,200
Can we catch a break?

1450
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:22,200
Can we catch a break?

1451
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:23,200
Can we catch a break?

1452
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:24,200
Can we catch a break?

1453
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:26,200
I'm going to get a cola.

1454
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,200
I'm going to make some food.

1455
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:30,200
I'll be about 4 minutes.

1456
02:02:34,200 --> 02:02:35,200
Okay.

1457
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:38,200
This is the first movie I have a close credit scene.

1458
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:39,200
Probably.

1459
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,200
But I'm not going to skip it anymore.

1460
02:02:41,200 --> 02:02:43,200
I'm going to watch it inner tyrity.

1461
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:44,200
Okay.

1462
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,200
You can have a whole 5 minutes.

1463
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,200
Ah, mmh.

1464
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,200
What is this?

1465
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:56,520
Okay, how about four minutes? Okay, I'll be as fast as I can, okay?

1466
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:59,560
Everyone make sure you stretch, make sure you get hydration while that does. I'm

1467
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:05,080
going to get a colo, okay? The four-minute union allocated break, real and true.

1468
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:09,880
And you making your way to the break room also counts as you've been on break, okay?

1469
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:12,760
Right, burpee!

1470
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:23,080
you

1471
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:53,080
you

1472
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:23,080
you

1473
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,080
you

1474
02:05:22,200 --> 02:05:23,080
you

1475
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:53,080
you

1476
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:23,080
you

1477
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:53,000
you

1478
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:23,080
you

1479
02:07:52,200 --> 02:08:15,880
are we ready for some yandere time?

1480
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:26,600
I've got a big, a few sandwich. I've got red onion, cheese, cucumber, carrot, corn,

1481
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:35,560
tuna, and kippy mayo on a sandwich, on a sanger.

1482
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:40,200
Bye-bye, 6am in the morning.

1483
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:50,440
Hey, okay. Successfully rescheduled with Katarina. I will be on her channel at

1484
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:59,320
a later date. Thank you so much. And again, if you- sorry, this is just straight up communication.

1485
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:08,280
Okay, right. Successfully rescheduled.

1486
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:19,720
All right. Oh yeah, kappa. That sounds awful. Wait, you don't like my sandwich?

1487
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:23,960
It's got all the veggies and protein and everything. Oh, it's not really got protein,

1488
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:29,400
unless you count the tuna. Oh, behind the scenes communication, yes. Are you guys ready to go again?

1489
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:37,160
Sorry, I'm addicted. I didn't expect that. Someone on Marshmallow whenever I go says

1490
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:46,360
iya neka. Oh, are you fucking serious? Means isn't it good, but it sounds like easy n. For

1491
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:51,880
fuck's sake. Sorry, I didn't read the rest of the message. Are you fucking serious?

1492
02:09:52,840 --> 02:10:02,440
Rape line. Don't- don't do that. I don't read past the first word until it's too late. For

1493
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:08,440
fuck's sake. Right, I said Japanese. Nihongo desu. Daijoubu. Daijoubu. Nihongo desu.

1494
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:13,640
Stop. I can't believe I- right, anyway.

1495
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:18,120
Hi, mommie. I think you got sidetracked and accidentally skipped my question. It was the

1496
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:21,800
one that started with an apology for the dupe question. Oh shit, didn't I even finish it?

1497
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:26,760
All right, sorry, let me try again. Hey, mommie. Sorry for the dupe question. Seeing how you get

1498
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:32,200
when you're in subspace and the mention of how it feels, I had a blue side idea. You have-

1499
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:35,960
I send you some stuff, like the pop stuff, and read through them on stream. I kind of think it

1500
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:39,800
would be interesting to see if we can get you to ink without touching. Oh no, I can't- I don't have

1501
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:49,080
that ability. I- I can't do that. I don't know how some people can do hands-free, but it's just not

1502
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:57,160
an ability of mine. Clip. Stop. Does your sandwich need more protein? Real unsure.

1503
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:04,040
Honestly, it doesn't sound as close to some of the other words. Very difficult. It's- I don't

1504
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:11,880
have that at me for it. Scale issue? You know what? One fucking two. You should ink yourself now.

1505
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:19,960
Right, are you ready to go? Are we ready to go again? Um, are we ready to go? A little- a

1506
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:25,320
little cheeky three two one. God, sorry. I must forget. I need to space after the five.

1507
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:35,720
A little cheeky three two one. Okay. Right, episode five. Happy sugar life. In three, two, one, go.

1508
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:42,520
Ooh, speaking of food, it's a cherry tomato. Yee-haw, it's a tomato, y'all.

1509
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:47,480
I've got cola as well.

1510
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:52,040
Do you need more communication skills? Absolutely.

1511
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:57,720
Oh my god, that's so ominous. Oh my god, it's

1512
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:05,480
Coneology from Jen to Vila. Sorry. Right, I'm about to stuff my face whilst we watch this,

1513
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:08,840
so give me a moment to really bite down on this.

1514
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:13,880
Fucking crunchy.

1515
02:12:22,520 --> 02:12:24,840
I love the cutin' funny.

1516
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:40,840
This is a shit sandwich. This is what this is.

1517
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:51,800
What? Crunchy like the sock, honestly.

1518
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:59,480
How do you make this sandwich, it's shit.

1519
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,840
Is it bad yet?

1520
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:18,280
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. If I mixed it together with the mayonnaise, it would have came out better,

1521
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:21,000
but I didn't have time because I didn't want to leave you waiting too long.

1522
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:25,400
So I literally just slapped everything on in between two pieces of bread.

1523
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,320
I mean, that's what a sandwich is anyway, but...

1524
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:42,760
I did this. Who's the culprit of these crimes, honestly?

1525
02:13:45,480 --> 02:13:46,760
I actually got the anxiety.

1526
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:54,760
What?

1527
02:13:57,560 --> 02:14:00,280
I'm gonna... please open your mouth to accept my burp.

1528
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:08,200
I'm sorry, that was rather disgusting, sorry. Sometimes I'm a little too sad.

1529
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,640
Oh, fuck.

1530
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:28,520
Possession alert. I like her outfit. Sending that one to the concept artist.

1531
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:40,840
Here's a laugh in the world. Violently laughin' in your face after burpin' in her.

1532
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:10,840
Oh, fuck.

1533
02:15:10,840 --> 02:15:25,160
Mm-hmm.

1534
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:37,160
Shit.

1535
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:53,160
Mm. I'm not yandere, are you?

1536
02:15:53,560 --> 02:16:03,480
She was just an ashtray. Smoking culture's pretty big in Japan.

1537
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:23,800
How was I made? Fuckin' spare me egg? What kind of question was that?

1538
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:42,520
Mm-hmm.

1539
02:16:54,040 --> 02:16:55,240
Ooh!

1540
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:05,480
Oh

1541
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:11,320
You're in a love confession

1542
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:36,480
Hmm

1543
02:17:40,680 --> 02:17:46,600
Underwear hardly even or we a piss

1544
02:17:51,080 --> 02:17:53,080
She wants to replace me

1545
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:05,480
You

1546
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,480
Why are you digging in

1547
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:20,560
No, no, I won't no, I don't think I will goodbye

1548
02:18:33,960 --> 02:18:35,960
Oh

1549
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:56,240

1550
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:02,680
What

1551
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:05,480
Oh

1552
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:16,200
What the fuck the fanservice is off the rails, what did she do that to make her be quiet?

1553
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:29,080
Whoa

1554
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
I

1555
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:42,000
Got my sandwich locked into my hands and I ain't taking a bait

1556
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:09,020
Don't tell me they're Lebanese

1557
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:18,440

1558
02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:35,480

Okay, I finished my time when it only took me like half an hour to eat it. Oh

I didn't expect the physics to jump on it

1618
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:29,400
I've got tears in my eyes

1619
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:34,680

Oh my god, that wasn't even that funny. It wasn't even comedic. Okay, right post-credits scene. Let's go

1631
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:42,680
Okay, oh my god a book out in a sweat

Okay, they're gonna team up right where was that scene

02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:54,200
I didn't even know what happened. Where was it?

02:35:54,920 --> 02:35:59,480
Right. I love you more even more than family. You're warmer and happier than my family

1635
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:02,200
So this was the cute scene and I was like, oh, it's kawaii, you know

1636
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:07,560
I don't even know if it was that funny

1637
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
No, I wasn't that funny

1638
02:36:14,040 --> 02:36:17,480
I think just because I didn't expect it. It's like

1639
02:36:18,440 --> 02:36:27,000
It's just it was not that funny at all. Oh my god, right episode six. That was not that funny

1640
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:34,200
I just I didn't expect a random tear to drop on her face. Oh

1641
02:36:36,040 --> 02:36:38,280
That was a good laugh. Oh wait, holy moly

1642
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:42,200
It's funny. You have the strangest sense of humor in the

1643
02:36:47,480 --> 02:36:49,480
Oh

1644
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:59,000
Oh, I just I didn't expect it and it was really funny. Okay

1645
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:11,080
Oh, it's fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine. It's a yandere enemy not a comedy calm down women

1646
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:14,120
Oh

1647
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:17,080
Ha

1648
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:21,480
Right, no, it's fine. I wasn't that funny

1649
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:26,920
Okay, it's a wrong good everyone ready for episode six of happy sweet life

1650
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:35,320
Let's hope there's no more tears falling on people's faces. Okay, because that was at least she's cry laughing this time not just crying

1651
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:38,200
Oh

1652
02:37:38,200 --> 02:37:40,920
So I think that's the first time I've ever had a laugh and fit

1653
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:46,600
Streaming it doesn't happen normally, but I never expected that's what happened

1654
02:37:47,080 --> 02:37:51,480
Strongly chuckles honestly, right? I'll do my countdown on go we go. Okay

1655
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:57,000
Uh three two one go

1656
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:59,720
Okay

1657
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:08,120
How is the pierced and gone wrong I was healing his fine

1658
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:11,080
I'm not having much problem

1659
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:16,040
It's attached itself back on which is what I thought it would do. So it's all good

1660
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,880
We know how to make you laugh now when you make you cry

1661
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:23,880
Okay

1662
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:29,240
Okay, so

1663
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:33,160
I don't mean to be that person like I have a weird sense of humor. Okay

1664
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:37,640
But if it's something evolving physics

1665
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:44,040
And I don't expect it. It makes me laugh my ass off. There's this dumb ass meme, right?

1666
02:38:45,480 --> 02:38:49,160
Of uh receipt that was in a trolley, right?

1667
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:57,160
It flies out of the trolley and someone plays the Harry Potter music as I do

1668
02:39:00,920 --> 02:39:02,920
And it's just the receipt

1669
02:39:05,320 --> 02:39:08,440
It's just the receipt flying out of a trolley

1670
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:15,560
Okay, it's not even uh need to find it. Sorry. I think I'm in a giggly mood today

1671
02:39:15,640 --> 02:39:18,040
Hold on. Let me see if I can find the meme in between the credits

1672
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:22,680
Harry Potter receipt and a trolley

1673
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:26,840
I try to find it

1674
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:30,360
No, what the fuck where is it? I don't know a receipt

1675
02:39:32,360 --> 02:39:34,360
I received flying out of a trolley

1676
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:41,960
I can't find it hold on

1677
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:45,800
No, it's not

1678
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:52,360
I'll find it after this team. It's like a receipt flying out of a trolley. Oh, is that a car? Maybe

1679
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:57,240
Uh, maybe it's a car because it's an american meme

1680
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:01,080
Out of a car

1681
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:06,840
Your laughter makes this sound so funny. It's not even mildly as humorous as I'm making it

1682
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:13,640
To be I can't find it. Oh my god. Right. It's this trolley and there's a receipt and then someone played

1683
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:20,680

Terms and conditions

02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:20,920
Receipt car funny music my came to humorous

Dice to keep us

1696
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:38,920
I

1697
02:41:38,920 --> 02:41:40,920
Not I was about to perish

1698
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:43,720
It was nice knowing you buddy

1699
02:41:59,720 --> 02:42:05,480
All right, okay, my spider senses were correct is the arm

1700
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:09,160
Or it was the arm

1701
02:42:11,800 --> 02:42:13,800
You

1702
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:23,480
Based movie in aslano based anime in aslano

1703
02:42:26,920 --> 02:42:31,640
He's gonna lure him into the apartment and kill him shortly. Well, he in danger all the

1704
02:42:41,640 --> 02:42:43,640
You

1705
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:05,560
This is only enough room for one little icon in the stand wasn't

1706
02:43:05,960 --> 02:43:07,960
And

1707
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:11,480
Wait are they looting her

1708
02:43:13,880 --> 02:43:17,640
Wait am I gonna see something really dumb right now is she doing stuff with her?

1709
02:43:19,480 --> 02:43:22,520
Or is she just like in love with her? I thought she was just in love with her

1710
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:27,880
Hold on a minute. Have I missed a massive plot hole here?

1711
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:30,600
Oh

1712
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:37,400
The best anime's avatar the last bit of ended got it

1713
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:48,200
I assume nothing else has happened because we haven't seen it. That's what I'm assuming as well

1714
02:43:57,880 --> 02:44:00,520
You

1715
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:30,840
Mm-hmm

1716
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:35,320
It doesn't change the fact that she kidnapped a wean and is in love with her. Yeah

1717
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:39,080
Normally you root for the main character

1718
02:44:40,680 --> 02:44:45,880
I'm a bit biased the she's probably safest in the hands of the yandere question mark

1719
02:44:47,880 --> 02:44:49,880
Num maybe the brother

1720
02:44:50,840 --> 02:44:52,840
I don't know

1721
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:56,760
Morally this anime is rather gray

1722
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:07,720
I don't think she's safe for the cycle killer true true

1723
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:13,480
Bum bum

1724
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:21,880
I

1725
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:34,440
So that's your safe for anyone actually like a magnet for bad stuff

1726
02:45:34,440 --> 02:45:36,440
I

1727
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:50,760
Safe is to sleep under the bed when you've gotten abusive parent

1728
02:46:04,680 --> 02:46:06,680
You

1729
02:46:20,120 --> 02:46:22,120
Oh, I passed out because he's starting

1730
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:31,720
I'm rooting for the good guys on the show the cops I'm rooting for shio and no one else

1731
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:35,320
I have to Gimli relax. I think

1732
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:52,520
And now she is feeding him architect bruise can't stop waiting with this one

1733
02:47:01,720 --> 02:47:03,720
So

1734
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:23,720
It's sketchy

1735
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:33,240
Shoko is the only normal person here people are biased because of the

1736
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:38,140
Because Yuri fans need nourishment

1737
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:50,200
What's the most common anime like tradition type a shounen a yuri anime

1738
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:55,720
I don't know

1739
02:48:12,360 --> 02:48:14,360
Love a yender oh

1740
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:28,120
This is so sad this anime

1741
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:50,200
Is this

1742
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:56,280
You

1743
02:49:04,440 --> 02:49:06,440
But she popped her clothes

1744
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:30,680
Wait, I assume this is platonically right this isn't like some Osaka

1745
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:35,160
Wait Osaka for police in the town

1746
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:44,440
This is getting weirder. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is like neutral, right? This is neutral, right?

1747
02:49:46,120 --> 02:49:49,160
Okay, no alabama here. Okay. It was just a

1748
02:49:53,960 --> 02:49:58,040
Okay, okay. Okay. Just checking like you never be too sure of these enemies

1749
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:03,080

You

1753
02:51:13,960 --> 02:51:15,960
No

1754
02:51:23,720 --> 02:51:25,720
You

1755
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:36,040

1756
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:47,160

Wait, so then they call so he only looks for shio

1763
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:45,320
Is that because he knows that oh that mother dearest has popped her clogs

1764
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:56,360
If it was me during the night, I wouldn't have a father anymore

1786
02:56:59,560 --> 02:57:05,720
I'm enjoying it. I had a laugh and fit. I've been shocked. I've had a few gasps

1787
02:57:07,240 --> 02:57:12,280
I don't know why the timer is freaking broken. I'll fix it next time you do a watcher on your breath

1788
02:57:18,360 --> 02:57:20,920
Not the east cubes shivering

1789
02:57:29,240 --> 02:57:31,240

02:57:32,920 --> 02:57:35,160
Reasons to cry and I need creative I miss something

02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:42,280
I mean she's telling it how it is

1792
02:57:59,560 --> 02:58:06,440
You definitely don't get involved or you're gonna end up with a eyeball

1793
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:27,880
Oh

1794
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:30,840
Oh

1795
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:32,840
Oh

1796
02:58:55,160 --> 02:58:57,720
Oh, are you sure

1797
02:59:01,800 --> 02:59:03,800
Oh

1798
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:20,440
Ah

1799
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:32,840
Oh

1800
02:59:39,400 --> 02:59:42,120
Is she gonna say that she's going to win

1801
03:00:01,400 --> 03:00:05,800
Is she actually gonna tell her she can tell feathers

1802
03:00:26,280 --> 03:00:30,360
Sorry my throat just croaked if you heard that when I gasped uh

1803
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:33,560
Uh

1804
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:40,440
It's happening

1805
03:00:41,800 --> 03:00:46,440
Meh meh it's happening. Okay. What's the posting credit now?

1806
03:00:48,760 --> 03:00:50,760
This isn't gonna end well

1807
03:00:51,320 --> 03:00:57,640
Now I don't want to say anything too controversial, but I've noticed in the opening there are three bags

1808
03:00:58,040 --> 03:01:04,040
And one two bags have pink on them and one has blue

1809
03:01:05,800 --> 03:01:07,800
Implying

1810
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:09,880
Potentially three deaths

1811
03:01:09,880 --> 03:01:17,880
By the chanderi now. I've already got confirmation or looks like it's confirmation that one pink bag was anti

1812
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:25,400
So there's room for the blonde guy in the blue bag and then there's one more chick that's going down

1813
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:29,000
And I'm getting nervous. Okay. I'm getting nervous

1814
03:01:29,960 --> 03:01:34,680
I'm getting sweaty. I'm getting shaky. I'm I'm not sure how this is gonna go

1815
03:01:36,440 --> 03:01:41,640
The best part is episode nine. So we're officially halfway through this anime officially

1816
03:01:45,880 --> 03:01:50,760
You think the bags are the owners I could be wrong I could be wrong. This is just my shitty theory

1817
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:57,800
I

1818
03:02:03,320 --> 03:02:09,480
Have no idea how this is gonna end and getting kind of puzzled every time like every time a new episode comes

1819
03:02:11,720 --> 03:02:17,320
Why do I feel like averting my eyes is it friendship lust or is it no

1820
03:02:19,320 --> 03:02:21,320
What the sugar girl is made out of

1821
03:02:22,200 --> 03:02:24,200
I

1822
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:26,200
wasn't much of a posting further

1823
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:28,600
Barton my mess

1824
03:02:28,760 --> 03:02:30,760
We're on episode seven

1825
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:43,000
As I said, uh, I'll go back in timestamp when we actually start the episode versus me yapping

1826
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:46,680
Who goes there identify yourself? Um

1827
03:02:47,640 --> 03:02:51,160
So you're planning to do this monthly one anime a month

1828
03:02:52,360 --> 03:02:55,320
So I can officially say I'm a weeb and no one can say that I'm not a weeb

1829
03:02:56,360 --> 03:02:57,560
Okay

1830
03:02:57,560 --> 03:02:59,560
10 out of 10

1831
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:03,640
I think I I think I found the receipt video

1832
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:07,080
I put it in marshmallow

1833
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:15,160
If I projectile vomit, then you know, you found the right video because

1834
03:03:16,680 --> 03:03:18,680
I

1835
03:03:42,520 --> 03:03:46,600
Okay, I've got I've got all my giggling out my system clearly link is it?

1836
03:03:46,680 --> 03:03:50,040
Oh, sorry. That was very rude of me. Of course. I should link it. Sorry

1837
03:03:50,600 --> 03:03:54,360
So I had a laughing fit over this video. It is the right video, but I think um

1838
03:03:55,480 --> 03:04:00,360
I'm all giggled out after my big laughing fit. I have I have no more giggles on the tank at the moment

1839
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,480
I don't know why it tickled me pink when I thought

1840
03:04:03,640 --> 03:04:05,640
I

1841
03:04:16,600 --> 03:04:18,600
It's just a goofy

1842
03:04:19,320 --> 03:04:21,320
Thank you for

1843
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:27,800
That laugh is absolutely durable. You're on pain meds or something else aren't you? No, I'm raw dog in life right now

1844
03:04:28,120 --> 03:04:30,120
I

1845
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:34,840
I strongly when I listen to your all audios and you

1846
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:41,080
Firework before I do I imagine smashing you harder while you're scoring just what you should know. Well

1847
03:04:43,800 --> 03:04:47,240
That's the rather honest marshmallow, isn't it?

1848
03:04:49,160 --> 03:04:52,440
Right are we ready and steady

1849
03:04:54,040 --> 03:04:55,640
for

1850
03:04:55,640 --> 03:04:56,840
the

1851
03:04:56,840 --> 03:04:58,840
10 views, how do you

1852
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:05,240
How did you find that?

1853
03:05:05,400 --> 03:05:08,520
Yeah, actually does have 10 views. Wait a minute. All those views are ours

1854
03:05:10,040 --> 03:05:12,040
Yeah, this is when I just

1855
03:05:13,240 --> 03:05:18,680
Strongly, I love you, but that was not funny. Well, I gave me a laughing fit when I saw it for the first time

1856
03:05:19,400 --> 03:05:21,400
Get right. All right

1857
03:05:21,880 --> 03:05:25,880
ready for episode seven happy sugar death life

1858
03:05:26,840 --> 03:05:31,160
And t-minus three two one go

1859
03:05:37,960 --> 03:05:42,760
Over getting lower the girl's parents passed away when she was young

1860
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Oh

1861
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:10,520
My humor is

1862
03:06:18,120 --> 03:06:20,120
And it just happens to be

1863
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:25,160
The one she can't even have her own family said

1864
03:06:27,800 --> 03:06:29,800
Oh

1865
03:06:32,440 --> 03:06:35,160
That's why she perished her

1866
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
MC was a slag

1867
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
You

1868
03:07:14,840 --> 03:07:17,800
The contrast of the intro is insane. I love it

1869
03:07:18,600 --> 03:07:20,600
It's just this guy's theory

1870
03:07:20,680 --> 03:07:25,240
And I think he's on the right. That's what my guesstimate would be from the information

1871
03:07:25,240 --> 03:07:27,240
I've gathered and

1872
03:07:27,480 --> 03:07:30,600
Simultaneously probably accidentally forgotten a few things

1873
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:34,360
Come out with a new bag for him

1874
03:07:34,520 --> 03:07:38,920
It came to him in a dream, but that's just the theory a game theory

1875
03:07:40,760 --> 03:07:42,760
I don't think there was an ant. Oh

1876
03:07:44,120 --> 03:07:49,320
No, I want to say the ant taught her about the yandere stuff because the ant always shows up and she's like oh

1877
03:07:49,320 --> 03:07:51,320
You're injured again. You're hurt again

1878
03:07:51,800 --> 03:07:55,000
But she was probably running away in yandere stuff, you know

1879
03:08:06,840 --> 03:08:10,680
Didn't this be a film theory, but that's just a theory an anime theory

1880
03:08:11,400 --> 03:08:13,400
Kawaii

1881
03:08:16,760 --> 03:08:21,480
Mommy's so bright. Yes, they're the brighter scenes. I'm fucking gallowing

1882
03:08:25,480 --> 03:08:31,400
We should watch made in abyss for the contrast thingy. Well, it's like constantly white black white black white black

1883
03:08:32,040 --> 03:08:34,920
Since the right and suggest he's pretty much correct by his mouth

1884
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:40,120
It seems likely I second made in abyss. It's quite good though. It's also some eyebrow reason

1885
03:08:41,160 --> 03:08:44,840
The show gives omori though. Ain't that that one video game?

1886
03:08:47,160 --> 03:08:50,120
Just with how people have distorted reality

1887
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
You

1888
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:21,800
We're getting low for her as well

1889
03:09:27,080 --> 03:09:34,120
Made in abyss has two seasons in the bin right now has that one season 12 episodes and then I'm satisfied that there's no filler episodes

1890
03:09:37,560 --> 03:09:39,720
I'm here for the plot I want to know what's up

1891
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:48,680
Is that my oh my pc's taken off well, it was nice knowing you

1892
03:09:56,280 --> 03:10:03,560
That has zero filler so maybe a weaver lawn a weaver thorn

1893
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:13,400
You

1894
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:19,480
Be if I had a Kawaii Disney voice it'd be over for you bitches

1895
03:10:22,840 --> 03:10:24,840
Hontoni

1896
03:10:28,920 --> 03:10:30,920
Kawaii

1897
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,880
Like if I had a Kawaii Disney voice it'd be over

1898
03:10:41,320 --> 03:10:43,320
It is a different charm to your voice

1899
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:49,880
Kokon Kokute

1900
03:10:53,960 --> 03:10:55,960
He already took you to handle

1901
03:11:06,120 --> 03:11:08,840
Animates have cliffhander endings to make you read the manga

1902
03:11:11,640 --> 03:11:16,040
I actually find it really cool how a manga gets uh

1903
03:11:22,040 --> 03:11:24,040
Uh no

1904
03:11:30,920 --> 03:11:32,920
Uh no

1905
03:11:41,640 --> 03:11:43,640
Uh

1906
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Manko

1907
03:12:11,240 --> 03:12:13,240
Oh

1908
03:12:17,400 --> 03:12:22,680
How do we get around this oh my god, well, why is it in that position?

1909
03:12:30,920 --> 03:12:32,920
What

1910
03:12:41,080 --> 03:12:43,080
Uh

1911
03:12:53,480 --> 03:12:55,480
Is he

1912
03:13:00,360 --> 03:13:02,860
Is he hands free and right now

1913
03:13:02,860 --> 03:13:04,860
I

1914
03:13:10,460 --> 03:13:12,460
Think he's hands free and right now

1915
03:13:12,860 --> 03:13:14,860
You

1916
03:13:31,820 --> 03:13:34,620
Oh my god, he's like

1917
03:13:42,700 --> 03:13:44,700
You

1918
03:14:04,220 --> 03:14:06,220

1919
03:14:06,780 --> 03:14:08,780
You get nervous

1920
03:14:10,380 --> 03:14:12,380
What

1921
03:14:12,700 --> 03:14:14,700
Uh

1922
03:14:16,940 --> 03:14:18,940
Is the game up

1923
03:14:26,220 --> 03:14:29,740
No, I'm getting tea so badly by this anime

1924
03:14:29,740 --> 03:14:31,740
I

1925
03:14:42,140 --> 03:14:44,140

You

03:22:49,740 --> 03:22:51,740
At strony's future the ginky

1973
03:23:00,860 --> 03:23:03,820
You

1974
03:23:30,860 --> 03:23:32,860
You

1975
03:23:43,820 --> 03:23:45,820
She's scared

1976
03:24:00,860 --> 03:24:02,860
Oh

1977
03:24:13,020 --> 03:24:15,020
Oh no

1978
03:24:27,340 --> 03:24:29,340
She sees through the lies

1979
03:24:30,860 --> 03:24:32,860
You

1980
03:24:47,420 --> 03:24:49,420
Just

1981
03:25:00,860 --> 03:25:02,860
You

1982
03:25:31,180 --> 03:25:36,060
When he's saying no means goodbye forever

1983
03:25:52,300 --> 03:25:55,420
Those are the same block but

1984
03:26:00,860 --> 03:26:02,860
You

1985
03:26:03,580 --> 03:26:05,580
You

1986
03:26:06,140 --> 03:26:08,140
You

1987
03:26:28,940 --> 03:26:33,180
You'll switch your route brother wit lush in this anime

1988
03:26:35,580 --> 03:26:40,140
Like the scenes are so cute when they're together, but like every other scene is like

1989
03:26:47,820 --> 03:26:52,940
It just was a random family to terrorist well, they seems like it to me

1990
03:26:54,780 --> 03:26:57,020
Maybe that's what the three bags where there's three

1991
03:26:57,740 --> 03:26:59,740
Oh

1992
03:27:07,180 --> 03:27:10,220
Yeah, my next case would be that she just killed her relived in the apartment. Yeah

1993
03:27:11,420 --> 03:27:13,900
Back to square one for who she perished. Yeah

1994
03:27:15,420 --> 03:27:17,420
This is

1995
03:27:18,140 --> 03:27:20,140
Very

1996
03:27:21,660 --> 03:27:23,660
I don't know what I was getting

1997
03:27:23,900 --> 03:27:29,660
So obviously I looked up. I was like, oh, what's the 12th part or anime that's like highly rated

1998
03:27:30,860 --> 03:27:34,940
And all I got told about this one was yandere. That's it. That's all I got told yandere

1999
03:27:35,340 --> 03:27:37,340
but like this is

2000
03:27:37,500 --> 03:27:41,660
This is the Byzantine empire because of how bizarre everything is going on

2001
03:27:43,100 --> 03:27:44,460
um

2002
03:27:44,460 --> 03:27:48,460
That assumes there's security cameras, no now the same the same england

2003
03:27:49,100 --> 03:27:54,540
There's cctv everywhere and the crime rate solving cases numbers are like rubbish

2004
03:27:55,740 --> 03:27:58,380
I don't think storing dead bodies in your own apartment is a good idea

2005
03:28:01,100 --> 03:28:06,780
After admit the goon cave is hilarious though for the aunt as much as the aunt is absolutely mental

2006
03:28:07,660 --> 03:28:10,780
The goon cave is hilarious. I don't care what anyone says

2007
03:28:11,260 --> 03:28:16,940
Oh, there's a bit of a smell emanating from this room. Can we check it out? Oh, I don't think that's a good idea

2008
03:28:17,100 --> 03:28:20,940
Oh, no, don't do that. And then they go in they start like hacking and wheezing the

2009
03:28:21,820 --> 03:28:27,020
The smell of ink is too thick in the middle. Like, sorry, that's funny. I can fix her

2010
03:28:28,060 --> 03:28:30,620
Oh the real post-credit scene this time

2011
03:28:35,100 --> 03:28:38,620
No, she's tracking it up, but she's not making much progress

2012
03:28:44,060 --> 03:28:46,860
Unless you spent all night doing it

2013
03:28:46,940 --> 03:28:48,940
Oh

2014
03:28:58,860 --> 03:29:00,860
You'll you still you

2015
03:29:17,020 --> 03:29:19,020
Hmm

2016
03:29:33,580 --> 03:29:35,580
What

2017
03:29:35,580 --> 03:29:37,580
You

2018
03:29:50,380 --> 03:29:52,380
Is this how she got the apartment

2019
03:29:57,180 --> 03:30:00,940
It is episode eight apartment life and went away

2020
03:30:01,740 --> 03:30:03,740
Oh

2021
03:30:05,340 --> 03:30:10,140
Sorry, I'm sucked in I'm I've got the good suck. Sorry. This is such a good

2022
03:30:10,780 --> 03:30:12,780
Anime, I don't care why no one says I'm

2023
03:30:13,100 --> 03:30:16,700
Sucked in are you I are you okay if I go

2024
03:30:17,660 --> 03:30:22,460

Wait, are we on eight or nine?

2047
03:33:59,980 --> 03:34:01,980

2057
03:35:49,020 --> 03:35:51,020

We're gonna be a past thing

2066
03:37:17,820 --> 03:37:19,820
For some people

2067
03:37:27,420 --> 03:37:29,420
You can make it into

2068
03:37:31,500 --> 03:37:34,700
Only if it's a man's money it becomes a hobby

2069
03:37:47,100 --> 03:37:49,100
Hmm

2070
03:37:59,260 --> 03:38:05,980
Well, maybe if the businesses and the charge of ridiculous fee on top you need to access the ball then counterfeit some

2071
03:38:17,580 --> 03:38:19,580

03:41:58,940 --> 03:42:02,300
Wow, this is such a bizarre story tone

2089
03:42:20,300 --> 03:42:33,420
I'm too low IQ. I need it. I need them to spell out to me

2090
03:42:40,300 --> 03:42:46,620
It's up with her face. I've never seen her look so happy and satisfied

2091
03:42:46,700 --> 03:42:53,740
Disgusting disgusting disgusting disgusting disgusting. That's not who she is

2092
03:42:56,460 --> 03:42:58,460
What is this feeling

2093
03:43:02,060 --> 03:43:05,260
Oh, I see I

2094
03:43:07,740 --> 03:43:10,300
Like how she was incomplete

2095
03:43:11,740 --> 03:43:14,140
I like her when she's crying

2096
03:43:15,100 --> 03:43:19,500
That she's not satisfied

2097
03:43:26,700 --> 03:43:30,540
That's why she's in the way

2098
03:43:40,460 --> 03:43:42,460
Oh

2099
03:43:44,140 --> 03:43:49,660

03:44:49,740 --> 03:44:51,740
That might be the blue bag

2106
03:45:02,860 --> 03:45:04,860

Just remember she left her that sock in case you need to use it on them real and true

2140
03:52:07,340 --> 03:52:09,980

Make them up and get some tips from you. So no post credit

2161
03:55:56,460 --> 03:55:59,100
Are you skipping ahead for me? Is there actually no post credit?

2162
03:56:00,460 --> 03:56:02,780
There isn't okay. We skip into nine

We

2164
03:56:08,700 --> 03:56:14,220
When I have to go back through this I'll be like, oh, can I stop yapping and actually start the dam on me?

2165
03:56:15,580 --> 03:56:18,540
It should be time for a break now. What should we do?

2166
03:56:20,220 --> 03:56:23,180
Well, I go get crispies. I don't know what to do for the break

2167
03:56:26,780 --> 03:56:29,180
However, I go get some crispy

2168
03:56:29,900 --> 03:56:31,900
I

2169
03:56:33,660 --> 03:56:38,140
Don't say this one out loud either, but it means run away, but it sounds like the other thing

2170
03:56:40,140 --> 03:56:43,580
Nigh run, I off I skipped out something

2171
03:56:47,740 --> 03:56:49,740
That laugh was adorable

2172
03:56:50,860 --> 03:56:56,060
How bad was the laugh? I don't know if I'll be able to time it. I have no idea what the timestamp of the laugh was

2173
03:56:56,780 --> 03:57:00,140
All right, I'm gonna very quickly grab some quickies, okay

Oh no, oh, it's not displaying correctly

2184
03:58:38,780 --> 03:58:40,140
Ah

2185
03:58:40,140 --> 03:58:47,020
It's because the stream isn't finished the time is like minus three hours 41 or whatever, but I can't do it backwards

2186
03:58:47,980 --> 03:58:49,980
I ain't smart enough for that

2187
03:58:50,940 --> 03:58:52,940
You're going for a whole 10 seconds

2188
03:58:53,980 --> 03:58:55,980
Life without strong is so

03:58:55,980 --> 03:58:57,980

Everyone's getting interconnected in a spider web

2217
04:05:02,780 --> 04:05:04,780
Oh

2218
04:05:24,300 --> 04:05:27,100

2221
04:06:02,540 --> 04:06:04,540
Oh

04:06:19,580 --> 04:06:22,060
Oh everyone's connected

2223
04:06:32,540 --> 04:06:34,540
Oh

2224
04:06:50,460 --> 04:06:52,460
What

2225
04:06:55,900 --> 04:06:58,700
Why should you remind it is she gonna confess

2226
04:07:02,940 --> 04:07:04,940
I

2227
04:07:14,540 --> 04:07:16,540
Think I'm just shagging the park

2228
04:07:32,540 --> 04:07:41,340
So then what's the mum lore why was the mum too far gone?

2229
04:08:02,540 --> 04:08:04,540
So

2230
04:08:32,780 --> 04:08:34,780
You

2231
04:08:45,660 --> 04:08:47,660
Okay, I finished my snackie no more munching

2232
04:09:03,180 --> 04:09:05,180
Oh

04:09:26,860 --> 04:09:29,740
What oh let's just install them on the way out

2235
04:09:33,500 --> 04:09:35,500
Oh

2236
04:09:41,100 --> 04:09:43,100
What

2237
04:09:50,220 --> 04:09:53,500
Is she just an assault that every living day lights out of him

2238
04:09:53,500 --> 04:10:00,220
Kisses him and then insults him

2239
04:10:01,900 --> 04:10:03,900
What in the fendom is this

2240
04:10:05,660 --> 04:10:07,660
What in that degradation is this

2241
04:10:23,500 --> 04:10:26,220
You

2242
04:10:53,500 --> 04:10:56,220
You

2243
04:11:23,500 --> 04:11:25,500
You

2244
04:11:44,540 --> 04:11:49,580
Again a bit speechless at these stages I'm not really sure if there's anything I can commentate on it's just

2245
04:11:54,220 --> 04:11:56,220
Oh

2246
04:12:17,260 --> 04:12:21,260
Like it's so wholesome and she's literally talking about perishing someone a moment ago

2247
04:12:24,460 --> 04:12:26,460
Oh

2248
04:12:33,340 --> 04:12:35,340
La pizza silly

2249
04:12:54,060 --> 04:12:56,060
Yuri fanservice off the steels

2250
04:13:12,220 --> 04:13:17,340
Why is it the desserts in anime always look so scrumdilly umptious and ironically

2251
04:13:24,380 --> 04:13:26,380
I

2252
04:13:26,780 --> 04:13:30,460
Was tickling a bib I don't think I don't know what the animators are doing

2253
04:13:31,500 --> 04:13:35,820
That's twice. There's been tickling in this anime and twice. It's been a bib

2254
04:13:40,940 --> 04:13:42,940
Because nobody likes to watch she fits

2255
04:13:46,060 --> 04:13:48,060
No, it was me

2256
04:13:53,500 --> 04:13:55,500
You

2257
04:14:11,180 --> 04:14:13,180
Illegal

2258
04:14:24,460 --> 04:14:26,860
Oh god, I'll sign him. He's bright

2259
04:14:30,780 --> 04:14:32,780
I don't remember that one

2260
04:14:33,260 --> 04:14:39,500
You're just jealous that boobs to tickle. You don't want one going going to the naughty corner two and think about what you've just said to me

2261
04:14:53,740 --> 04:14:55,740
You

2262
04:15:11,500 --> 04:15:13,500

You

2264
04:15:53,820 --> 04:15:55,820
You

2265
04:16:07,340 --> 04:16:10,220
This is still rather morally brave

2266
04:16:10,460 --> 04:16:12,460
I

2267
04:16:18,140 --> 04:16:26,060
This is how it really filled everyone in this show this show is certainly unique. I don't think I've ever consumed anything like this

2268
04:16:26,380 --> 04:16:28,380
I

2269
04:16:39,180 --> 04:16:41,820
I'm not sure how I feel about this

2270
04:16:57,020 --> 04:17:01,660
Yeah, this isn't morally great. This is fucked up. Honestly. I'm like

2271
04:17:04,780 --> 04:17:08,780
This is not she kidnapped the girl called multiple people in life. I caught what do you mean?

2272
04:17:11,420 --> 04:17:13,420
Oh

2273
04:17:13,820 --> 04:17:15,820
Shaitou

2274
04:17:27,020 --> 04:17:29,020
Oh shaitou

2275
04:17:31,980 --> 04:17:33,980
I'm fucking scared

2276
04:17:43,500 --> 04:17:47,180
All the police man came over for the shag. Oh, he's in the gun cave

2277
04:17:57,020 --> 04:17:59,020
Let's go clover

2278
04:18:02,060 --> 04:18:04,060
Eh

2279
04:18:05,820 --> 04:18:07,820

2280
04:18:07,980 --> 04:18:09,980

2282
04:18:27,180 --> 04:18:29,180
You

2283
04:18:49,660 --> 04:18:51,660
Uh

2284
04:18:51,980 --> 04:19:05,660
Why is she getting a song I don't like where this is going

2285
04:19:19,500 --> 04:19:21,500
I don't like where this is going

2286
04:19:22,300 --> 04:19:24,300
I

2287
04:19:27,260 --> 04:19:29,260
I'm getting real nervous

2288
04:19:30,700 --> 04:19:33,900
That my three back theory wasn't exactly wrong

2289
04:19:51,660 --> 04:19:53,660
You

2290
04:19:53,980 --> 04:19:55,980
You

2291
04:20:19,260 --> 04:20:21,260
When they use the word sayonara

2292
04:20:24,060 --> 04:20:26,060
I don't like this

2293
04:20:39,980 --> 04:20:41,980
She's walking away, okay

2294
04:20:54,620 --> 04:21:01,020
Okay, just leave the apartment

04:21:15,100 --> 04:21:17,100

Oh

2299
04:21:48,380 --> 04:21:50,380
Oh

2300
04:21:53,660 --> 04:21:55,660
You

2301
04:22:04,460 --> 04:22:06,460
Oh

2302
04:22:07,180 --> 04:22:09,180
Oh

2303
04:22:14,940 --> 04:22:16,940

04:23:39,740 --> 04:23:41,820
She sent the picture silly

2312
04:23:44,380 --> 04:23:47,420
Mwah, okay. Are you ready?

2313
04:23:53,660 --> 04:23:55,660

04:24:16,140 --> 04:24:18,140
Wah

04:24:19,980 --> 04:24:22,540

I

2321
04:24:25,980 --> 04:24:30,940
Don't even have like words to formulate about the situation. I'm like, how does this end?

2322
04:24:33,660 --> 04:24:38,860
If my back theory is correct, that's two bags out of three

2323
04:24:40,380 --> 04:24:43,100
The first one being the artist who owned the apartment

2324
04:24:44,220 --> 04:24:49,580
Two was the best friend that she never saw as the best friend. So what is three the brother?

You

2394
04:41:01,020 --> 04:41:06,220
This feels like the finale it does I know there's two more episodes, but oh my gosh

2395
04:41:10,540 --> 04:41:13,500
Shoko died for this real

2396
04:41:22,860 --> 04:41:24,860
You

2397
04:41:24,860 --> 04:41:26,860
You

2398
04:41:27,820 --> 04:41:29,820
You

2399
04:41:50,620 --> 04:41:55,260
I like the symbolism of the kraken because like yandere's always like crack

2400
04:41:56,860 --> 04:41:58,860
You

2401
04:42:14,620 --> 04:42:16,620
Yandere's love crack

2402
04:42:22,220 --> 04:42:25,020
The mango wasn't finished yet and he tried their best and

2403
04:42:26,860 --> 04:42:28,860
You

2404
04:42:50,940 --> 04:42:52,940

I get it there

2433
04:46:43,100 --> 04:46:45,100
Not time for me

2434
04:46:45,260 --> 04:46:47,260
After this

2435
04:46:48,380 --> 04:46:57,420
Who's created it we will kill heretics, you know, we demand you know, the ghosts are back shadow blocks in time

2436
04:46:57,420 --> 04:46:59,420
I

2437
04:47:15,820 --> 04:47:21,980
Know what to formulate about this on me. Yeah, I know there's two more episodes to go forget him

2438
04:47:27,740 --> 04:47:29,740
You

2439
04:47:40,620 --> 04:47:43,740
Studio blank more like studio

2440
04:47:57,660 --> 04:47:59,660
You

2441
04:48:06,460 --> 04:48:08,460
Maybe

2442
04:48:13,580 --> 04:48:15,580
What

2443
04:48:15,740 --> 04:48:20,300
And each other moment with you. Oh my god episode 11 up to come

2444
04:48:21,340 --> 04:48:23,500
Any episode 11 watchers?

2445
04:48:28,380 --> 04:48:33,660
Hold on hold on any episode 11 watchers of happy sugar life

2446
04:48:37,580 --> 04:48:39,580
It's literally two more episodes and then

2447
04:48:40,620 --> 04:48:43,740
We get to fully formulate and confirm that I'm a weeb

2448
04:48:44,620 --> 04:48:49,100
Surely one episode of anime one one anime makes me a weeb sure

2449
04:48:50,700 --> 04:48:52,700
Still a gamer though

2450
04:48:53,740 --> 04:48:55,340
Okay

2451
04:48:55,420 --> 04:48:58,620
All right two more to go. How does this anime end?

2452
04:48:59,660 --> 04:49:02,940
three two one go

2453
04:49:05,580 --> 04:49:07,580
Um

2454
04:49:11,900 --> 04:49:13,900
Wait is he the one that killed his dad

2455
04:49:20,620 --> 04:49:22,620
But nothing changed

2456
04:49:25,500 --> 04:49:30,060
What a broken jar is how to do

2457
04:49:31,420 --> 04:49:37,100
Is that different dive or muckle? Okay. I was just chasing in case he was secretly leaving

2458
04:49:39,900 --> 04:49:42,860
Can't believe liver school isn't perlucent

2459
04:49:50,540 --> 04:49:52,540
No

2460
04:49:56,220 --> 04:49:58,220
Oh

2461
04:50:02,300 --> 04:50:04,460
I feel like the thoughts gonna thicken real quick

2462
04:50:12,700 --> 04:50:19,100
Then the intro gets me every time it's just hydration check response

2463
04:50:25,340 --> 04:50:27,340
You

2464
04:50:32,860 --> 04:50:36,060
Need to make fun of someone's favorite anime to get the weeb fired

2465
04:50:38,060 --> 04:50:44,700
One shot one shot viewers be like I can't wait to watch another episode of filler

2466
04:50:45,420 --> 04:50:47,420
Did I do it right?

2467
04:50:47,900 --> 04:50:51,660
Surely there's filler episodes in one shot because how in earth do you get a thousand

2468
04:50:52,220 --> 04:50:57,020
See like episodes of an anime and it's not filler just pure filler

2469
04:51:00,060 --> 04:51:03,020
How many times have they done a beach episode

2470
04:51:03,900 --> 04:51:07,980
What's one shot? Oh one piece. Sorry. Sorry the one piece is real

2471
04:51:09,020 --> 04:51:11,260
Sorry the one piece is real

2472
04:51:14,620 --> 04:51:20,540
What sorry one shot is what I am okay 70 percent recap is the previous episode

2473
04:51:22,620 --> 04:51:25,100
One shot is a fantastic game

2474
04:51:29,660 --> 04:51:34,940
And you want a weeb card after naming one of the biggest enemies incorrectly. Yeah, sure why not

2475
04:51:37,420 --> 04:51:42,460
If one piece was one shot people wouldn't have waited 30 years. Yeah one shot one

2476
04:51:43,900 --> 04:51:49,580
One piece fans be like, oh, I can't wait for another season to drop and it takes another four years to produce

2477
04:51:50,540 --> 04:51:54,220
Fucking wrap up the series surely the story's ended right surely

2478
04:52:11,980 --> 04:52:15,580
Did you not remember about what I said about being publicly executed

2479
04:52:16,460 --> 04:52:18,460
I

2480
04:52:19,020 --> 04:52:22,460
Feel like if you're watching a one piece

2481
04:52:24,460 --> 04:52:31,020
You're just here for a good time and you're like, haha. Yeah, okay, you got me you got me 800 episodes then you got me

2482
04:52:36,380 --> 04:52:39,100
But he just cannot get a break from bdsm

2483
04:52:45,580 --> 04:52:47,580
You

2484
04:52:57,340 --> 04:52:59,340
Oh

2485
04:52:59,340 --> 04:53:14,620
You guys kidnapped me almost four heads the average roofling

2486
04:53:29,340 --> 04:53:31,340
You

2487
04:53:59,340 --> 04:54:01,340
You

2488
04:54:01,340 --> 04:54:03,340
You

2489
04:54:03,340 --> 04:54:05,340
You

2490
04:54:28,300 --> 04:54:30,300
He's gonna rip his finger nails out

2491
04:54:34,300 --> 04:54:36,300
Oh

2492
04:54:47,340 --> 04:54:49,340
Oh

2493
04:54:49,340 --> 04:54:51,340
Joink in fingernails

2494
04:54:58,780 --> 04:55:03,980
Does it happen in kagaguri as well she rips all her fingernails off in a bit and I'm like

2495
04:55:04,940 --> 04:55:07,660
Is this like a common yakuza thing or something?

2496
04:55:09,660 --> 04:55:12,620
I lost my fingernails because I even get to the yakuza

2497
04:55:13,420 --> 04:55:17,580
Sorry, that was the most pathetic sense. Like I've ever muttered in a very long time. My apologies

2498
04:55:20,300 --> 04:55:22,300
I

2499
04:55:27,900 --> 04:55:31,500
Let you choose I was losing my finger. No, no, you're thinking of assassin's food

2500
04:55:37,500 --> 04:55:39,500
Oh

2501
04:55:49,340 --> 04:55:51,340
Oh

2502
04:55:59,340 --> 04:56:01,340

2504
04:56:19,340 --> 04:56:21,340
You

2505
04:56:37,020 --> 04:56:39,020
She's recruiting her aunt

2506
04:56:40,780 --> 04:56:42,780
To the good in cave at once

2507
04:56:50,300 --> 04:56:52,300

Unrelenting forgiveness

2516
04:59:49,340 --> 04:59:51,340
You

2517
05:00:12,540 --> 05:00:14,540
The blink noise

2518
05:00:19,340 --> 05:00:21,340
You

05:00:31,340 --> 05:00:33,340
Extra money

2520
05:00:33,340 --> 05:00:35,340
You

2521
05:00:49,340 --> 05:00:51,340

What is that oh, you don't know

2525
05:01:27,580 --> 05:01:29,580
If I do it sounds like a bullseye

2526
05:01:34,300 --> 05:01:36,300
You

2527
05:01:44,540 --> 05:01:46,540
It's just my mouth

2528
05:01:46,540 --> 05:01:48,540
My mouth is open

2529
05:01:48,540 --> 05:01:50,700
And I push my my tongue to my teeth

2530
05:01:52,140 --> 05:01:54,140
As I guess I have a really white mouth

2531
05:01:58,620 --> 05:02:00,620
Pop up up up

The music actually did start playing

2572
05:10:25,020 --> 05:10:27,420
Did go and upgrade to come I think he broke his jar

2573
05:10:32,940 --> 05:10:35,660
You

2574
05:11:03,900 --> 05:11:06,380
I know it can be messed up something real untrue

2575
05:11:26,220 --> 05:11:28,220
Oh, whoa, hold on

2576
05:11:33,900 --> 05:11:35,900
I'll jump hold on a minute

2577
05:11:44,860 --> 05:11:51,420
You know the murder I can forgive and you know a lot of stuff is rather forgivable

2578
05:11:53,660 --> 05:11:55,660
Hmm

2579
05:11:56,380 --> 05:11:58,380
To the final episode, yeah

2580
05:11:58,780 --> 05:12:00,620
This is rather

2581
05:12:00,620 --> 05:12:02,620
I did not expect it to

2582
05:12:03,420 --> 05:12:05,420
Rather curious. Yes

2583
05:12:05,740 --> 05:12:07,740
Is there an ending scene?

2584
05:12:09,420 --> 05:12:12,940
Bad sister, how do you forgive the murder? Oh, I can forgive murder

2585
05:12:18,940 --> 05:12:23,580
Uh any ending scene on this one it doesn't look like there's an ending scene on this one

2586
05:12:26,220 --> 05:12:28,220
Shoko

2587
05:12:28,220 --> 05:12:35,500
Like if shoko got the balls to go for it or back off, but because she constantly played on the fence that makes it up

2588
05:12:37,260 --> 05:12:40,220
Murder I assume that's how you wanted me to say it

2589
05:12:40,940 --> 05:12:43,340
Just a wee bit of my thumb. All right. Well

2590
05:12:44,860 --> 05:12:46,460
The finale

2591
05:12:46,460 --> 05:12:50,540
Shawnee I'm starting to question your moral compass. You don't remember I used to want to perish many

2592
05:12:50,620 --> 05:12:52,620
Can you forget that part? Okay, right?

2593
05:12:52,780 --> 05:12:54,780
This is the finale

2594
05:12:54,860 --> 05:12:56,860
I don't know how much will happen

2595
05:12:57,260 --> 05:12:59,260
We're going to find out

2596
05:12:59,900 --> 05:13:05,900
Well 24 minutes and we're going to review this this anime how? Okay, ready?

2597
05:13:06,860 --> 05:13:07,900
three

2598
05:13:07,900 --> 05:13:09,900
two one go

2599
05:13:11,500 --> 05:13:13,500
The finale

2600
05:13:13,980 --> 05:13:15,980
Shouldn't deserve to get murdered

2601
05:13:17,340 --> 05:13:19,340
Say that probably not

2602
05:13:27,340 --> 05:13:35,260
You know you got the Japanese passport you can pop off any prefecture

2603
05:13:49,820 --> 05:13:53,580
You can bring the wee rubber duck obviously why not

2604
05:13:56,940 --> 05:13:58,940
Oh

2605
05:14:04,380 --> 05:14:06,380
Oh, oh no

2606
05:14:11,660 --> 05:14:18,060
Okay, but actually me though, you're playing there's still some thick stuff. He's dying

2607
05:14:18,060 --> 05:14:20,060
I

2608
05:14:25,740 --> 05:14:28,380
That's what I want you to sound like by the same I'm finished for you

2609
05:14:30,700 --> 05:14:33,580
Sorry, I can't answer the phone right now. I can't get shagged by a milk

2610
05:14:39,100 --> 05:14:42,380
Good to dare that's a succubus there

2611
05:14:48,220 --> 05:14:50,220
You

2612
05:14:57,100 --> 05:15:02,380
You're gonna get an artwork made of us is it gonna be the scene I think the foot scene has my vote

2613
05:15:02,460 --> 05:15:06,060
I like the foot scene the most like the black male kind of thing

2614
05:15:07,260 --> 05:15:12,060
My current vote is the foot scene. I don't know how you guys would feel. We'll discuss it at the end of this episode

2615
05:15:12,940 --> 05:15:17,980
But I think I'd prefer the black male foot scene. That's my favorite kind of thing so far

2616
05:15:27,900 --> 05:15:30,380
Taken to mummy's gun cave. Oh, maybe maybe

2617
05:15:31,100 --> 05:15:36,380
So it's seen our gun cave my personal preference would be foot black male versus gun cave

2618
05:15:37,500 --> 05:15:39,500
But don't let me influence you

2619
05:15:42,540 --> 05:15:44,540
Mm-hmm

2620
05:15:44,540 --> 05:15:46,540
Mm-hmm

2621
05:15:46,540 --> 05:15:48,540
Mm

2622
05:16:10,300 --> 05:16:12,300
True winable

2623
05:16:13,020 --> 05:16:15,020
How about the food scene picture and

2624
05:16:17,180 --> 05:16:19,180
Young black male audio

2625
05:16:39,900 --> 05:16:41,900
Uh

2626
05:16:42,380 --> 05:16:45,980
She's alive. No, she cannae be

2627
05:16:51,580 --> 05:16:53,580
No, she cannae be alive

2628
05:17:05,580 --> 05:17:07,580
No

2629
05:17:07,580 --> 05:17:10,800
They're a bit morbid. Okay

2630
05:17:37,580 --> 05:17:39,580
Oh

2631
05:18:00,860 --> 05:18:02,860
Oh my

2632
05:18:02,860 --> 05:18:05,180

2634
05:18:54,060 --> 05:18:56,060
We're gonna wait

2635
05:19:02,860 --> 05:19:04,860

All right, no, it's his hand. Sorry. It was the it was the render distance

2639
05:19:52,460 --> 05:19:55,580
Oh no, his legs what oh my god, he's hog tied

2640
05:20:03,660 --> 05:20:05,660

You

2648

You

2649
05:22:45,260 --> 05:22:47,260
Look at your chops in the lift

2650
05:23:02,860 --> 05:23:04,860
Oh

2651
05:23:22,780 --> 05:23:24,780
Oh

2652
05:23:29,340 --> 05:23:31,340
She doesn't really seem to care

2653
05:23:32,860 --> 05:23:34,860
You

2654
05:23:53,740 --> 05:23:56,140

Carbon dioxide is music

2683

As a carbon monoxide and maybe monoxide

2684
05:28:48,320 --> 05:28:50,320

I don't know why you're playing the upbeat music

2698
05:32:35,600 --> 05:32:37,600

Oh

2704
05:33:36,320 --> 05:33:38,320
I ain't got too dense for this

2705
05:33:41,520 --> 05:33:44,080
Flashes of what what their life could have been

2706
05:33:48,320 --> 05:33:51,040
You

2707
05:34:18,320 --> 05:34:21,040
You

2708
05:34:48,320 --> 05:34:51,040

05:35:48,320 --> 05:35:51,040
You

Huh

2717
05:37:28,080 --> 05:37:34,000
Would anyone like to very quickly summarize the fucking synopsis real quick what the fuck I don't get it

2718
05:37:35,680 --> 05:37:37,680
So they commit sudoku together

2719
05:37:39,440 --> 05:37:44,720
But because the body was cushioned she gave up her body as the ultimate love

2720
05:37:46,240 --> 05:37:54,160
And she lost a part of her mind and now the weans also yandere but think the part of satoshi because they're all beginning with s at the same time

2721
05:37:55,920 --> 05:37:57,920
Yeah

2722
05:37:58,400 --> 05:38:00,400
Uh

2723
05:38:04,080 --> 05:38:08,720
So that will protect us her where a body she basically became mentally ill

2724
05:38:16,160 --> 05:38:18,160
Hmm

Husky 3721 thank you for the 20 gifted memberships jesus. You guys like anime that much?

2751
05:40:24,560 --> 05:40:26,560
I fucking did a shit watch along with that one

2752
05:40:28,000 --> 05:40:30,000
Um

2753
05:40:30,080 --> 05:40:32,080
I also watched the stream

2754
05:40:35,840 --> 05:40:37,840
Uh, yes

2755
05:40:38,000 --> 05:40:43,440
That was very unique. I did not expect it to go that way like the the intro. I really like the intro

2756
05:40:43,520 --> 05:40:46,480
I like the sensei black male section

2757
05:40:47,440 --> 05:40:50,400
Uh, I like um

2758
05:40:53,520 --> 05:40:55,520
Thank you very much for the gifted membership. Yeah, dang

2759
05:41:00,400 --> 05:41:08,400
Donations to never listen to read it recommendation again, I think I'll let you guys recommend the anime that's really 12 episodes or less

2760
05:41:09,120 --> 05:41:11,120
Uh

2761
05:41:11,360 --> 05:41:18,880
Oh, yeah, there was also the grape on the guy by uh hags. That was very unique. I haven't seen that before. Um

2762
05:41:20,400 --> 05:41:26,080
Would you be willing to do a 24 episode anime? Uh, it would open up a lot of good recommendations. Uh,

2763
05:41:27,040 --> 05:41:29,040
possibly maybe with a

2764
05:41:30,080 --> 05:41:32,080
rating out of 10

2765
05:41:32,320 --> 05:41:34,320
like

2766
05:41:35,120 --> 05:41:38,960
I had I don't know if I can rate it until asleep on it

2767
05:41:39,920 --> 05:41:45,280
Like when when it was the whole like sensei black, but oh 10 out of 10 loved it. Oh, that's cute

2768
05:41:46,320 --> 05:41:49,920
I like kind of finding out more about the story. Um

2769
05:41:54,240 --> 05:41:57,840
It kind of feels like one of those empty endings where it's like

2770
05:41:58,640 --> 05:42:01,760
Oh people died but for what because basically

2771
05:42:02,000 --> 05:42:04,000
What

2772
05:42:04,640 --> 05:42:06,640
Ween got like

2773
05:42:09,360 --> 05:42:16,320
I don't know. I think I think I'd need to I need to nap on it to be able to accurately range it. I like the show

2774
05:42:17,840 --> 05:42:19,840
It was curious

2775
05:42:20,720 --> 05:42:25,920
I know you have to remember I don't watch too much concepts like that before she died for love

2776
05:42:26,000 --> 05:42:30,800
I mean, I guess. Yes. She event. She got her love in the end. That makes sense

2777
05:42:32,080 --> 05:42:34,080
Um, I also only watch

2778
05:42:34,640 --> 05:42:38,560
Only your first time, but visually had a lot of bad things come on between the past

2779
05:42:40,240 --> 05:42:42,240
and

2780
05:42:42,240 --> 05:42:48,160
Hairboy B-Bot she'll basically just becomes mentally ill and becomes like fat old and that's pretty much the ending

2781
05:42:49,200 --> 05:42:51,200
hit or miss

2782
05:42:51,200 --> 05:42:56,080
My recommendation is daily lives of high school boys. I thought it was funny

2783
05:42:57,520 --> 05:42:59,840
Violet Evergarden will we watch it together?

2784
05:43:00,800 --> 05:43:04,880
Did I really just miss the stream? I'll teeny tiny whiny bit

2785
05:43:05,600 --> 05:43:10,800
Um, it says she be's on hitman absolution right now. I don't know if that's what she was planning on doing

2786
05:43:11,040 --> 05:43:13,040
a cheeky

2787
05:43:13,040 --> 05:43:15,040
cheeky bit of

2788
05:43:16,640 --> 05:43:18,640
Um

2789
05:43:22,800 --> 05:43:24,800
Yeah, she never missed her

2790
05:43:30,560 --> 05:43:32,560
Uh

2791
05:43:34,960 --> 05:43:40,560
I'm just waiting she be is currently busy on discord. So I can't see it 12 episode. I don't mean 12 episodes

2792
05:43:41,760 --> 05:43:46,880
It's like my modus. Yes. I will fix the watch along tamer nice thing because I don't know why that broke

2793
05:43:47,040 --> 05:43:49,040
I feel like it was working the track

2794
05:43:49,840 --> 05:43:51,840
When I saw her face

2795
05:43:52,240 --> 05:43:54,240
Now I'm a believer

2796
05:44:00,240 --> 05:44:02,240
Uh

2797
05:44:03,120 --> 05:44:06,480
Cam on strongy give happy sugar life a fair shake

2798
05:44:07,200 --> 05:44:12,560
It had you invested from episode one just admit the rory con and I mean it's good

2799
05:44:15,360 --> 05:44:18,880
I'm becoming a weaver rory con. Yeah is a

2800
05:44:21,840 --> 05:44:23,840
Whoa, no stereo

2801
05:44:25,120 --> 05:44:26,880
stereo

2802
05:44:26,880 --> 05:44:33,600
Lollipop shrek 5 and 226 remember 100% would recommend angel beat every six episodes or more

2803
05:44:34,880 --> 05:44:37,920
She had a migraine and didn't stream. Hmm

2804
05:44:39,360 --> 05:44:41,360
Someone says she's gonna do gorilla

2805
05:44:45,120 --> 05:44:47,120
That sounds like the turtle

2806
05:44:48,800 --> 05:44:54,800
I'm not sure what to feel walking away from I'm sure I'll have a better opinion tomorrow. Thank you, brulee legend for the set

2807
05:44:55,760 --> 05:44:57,760
I said, we're just gonna watch ben tie together

2808
05:45:07,760 --> 05:45:09,760
She tweeted about

2809
05:45:09,760 --> 05:45:11,760
that but it was an oracle

2810
05:45:12,240 --> 05:45:15,760
Angel beats made me cry. I was a journey all right, but I have a good plot then

2811
05:45:16,560 --> 05:45:18,560
Okay, if you guys are recommending a

2812
05:45:19,200 --> 05:45:21,200
very then

2813
05:45:22,160 --> 05:45:25,920
I will I'm happy to do that next month and then we'll come up with the next like

2814
05:45:26,080 --> 05:45:32,080
We're only gonna do one anime watch a long pair of months like I'm not gonna like all of a sudden turn around and be like a anime expert

2815
05:45:32,640 --> 05:45:34,640
in actually

2816
05:45:36,480 --> 05:45:38,480
Bentay is better. Okay, let's do bentay

2817
05:45:40,480 --> 05:45:41,680
And

2818
05:45:41,680 --> 05:45:43,680
hearing you hum

2819
05:45:43,760 --> 05:45:49,040
Even a couple seconds of the song gave me PTSD flashback flashbacks never read

2820
05:45:49,760 --> 05:45:53,920
It's the only piece of me now ever consumed in the reading that terrified me

2821
05:45:55,120 --> 05:45:57,120
Wait, what did I hum?

2822
05:45:59,040 --> 05:46:03,760
What is that hum? Good. Good night, pun pun

2823
05:46:10,880 --> 05:46:12,880
This isn't a bad song

2824
05:46:14,720 --> 05:46:16,720
It's oh, yeah

2825
05:46:19,360 --> 05:46:22,080
I know that it's hard to do

2826
05:46:25,520 --> 05:46:27,920
It's a good song not particularly that

2827
05:46:28,960 --> 05:46:30,960
ever we've strung so

2828
05:46:31,360 --> 05:46:35,360
I would recommend personal faith being blood see it's very uh

2829
05:46:38,160 --> 05:46:41,920
It's very fully dubbed. I don't know. We're gonna find out next month when I have to talk about

2830
05:46:42,400 --> 05:46:42,960
Hey, strutty

2831
05:46:42,960 --> 05:46:46,640
Just to let you know there are animes that are 11 or 13 episodes as well to be sure to look up for those

2832
05:46:46,640 --> 05:46:51,760
I'll throw in quick recommendations. Uh, I know Hannah. It's a living ex as well

2833
05:46:54,240 --> 05:46:58,160
Uh, hey, strutty. Hi, Rachel. And I would also recommend you read

2834
05:46:59,200 --> 05:47:01,200
Read or die over a very important

2835
05:47:03,840 --> 05:47:05,840
Optional reading

2836
05:47:08,080 --> 05:47:10,080
It's somewhat like x-men mutant

2837
05:47:10,800 --> 05:47:14,080
Uh-oh, I know Hannah mentioned. Wait, what's wrong with I know Hannah?

2838
05:47:14,800 --> 05:47:16,800
It's been recommended

2839
05:47:16,880 --> 05:47:21,600
Hi, strutty. I love your dorky sense of humor. Your laugh sues my soul. Actually, wait, where is my laugh?

2840
05:47:23,360 --> 05:47:25,360
Where's my laugh? I want to hear it

2841
05:47:25,600 --> 05:47:31,680
I I had a laugh and fit on one of the episodes like an absolute baby. Oh god. How quick would it be in?

2842
05:47:33,520 --> 05:47:35,520
Oh, I have no idea where it would be

2843
05:47:36,560 --> 05:47:38,560
We'll be laughing, but

2844
05:47:38,560 --> 05:47:40,560
I

2845
05:47:45,680 --> 05:47:48,720
See everything the water streams five hours ago

2846
05:47:51,440 --> 05:47:54,480
And then it would be what three hours and 20 minutes

2847
05:47:58,640 --> 05:48:00,640
We'll try

2848
05:48:04,320 --> 05:48:07,760
Sorry the way it's displaying on my end isn't actually showing me

2849
05:48:08,800 --> 05:48:10,800
What the

2850
05:48:12,720 --> 05:48:15,760
Oh, I'm gonna have to just clip it and find out tomorrow

2851
05:48:19,280 --> 05:48:21,280
There's a 314

2852
05:48:23,680 --> 05:48:25,680
Oh

2853
05:48:32,880 --> 05:48:34,880
You're gonna hear myself twice don't panic

2854
05:48:34,960 --> 05:48:41,680
Okay, I'm about to have a laugh and fit in the voice chat. Don't worry. Don't panic

2855
05:48:49,280 --> 05:48:53,920
No, my youtube keeps bugging out they freaking update youtube so it's just one big buggy mess now

2856
05:48:54,080 --> 05:48:57,360
I thought she was going to confess the murders. I'm like, why would you tell her the

2857
05:48:57,760 --> 05:49:02,640
No, it's gonna freak her out. Of course. She's not gonna like this. Oh my god. It's me in the past. Hi past me

2858
05:49:05,760 --> 05:49:16,400
I'm waiting for the laugh. Come on

2859
05:49:20,880 --> 05:49:26,400
Okay, that was a bit kawaii news. Okay, I'll give you that one. I'll give you that one. Happy sugar life. That was a kawaii news team

2860
05:49:27,920 --> 05:49:29,920
Oh

2861
05:49:29,920 --> 05:49:31,920
Oh

2862
05:49:43,760 --> 05:49:51,280
Oh, no, it broke it broke dammit. Sorry my u-block is also a cap to books literally

2863
05:49:53,760 --> 05:49:55,760
It was laughing

2864
05:49:56,480 --> 05:50:02,720
Oh, I need it. But once we've watched the post-credits, I'm gonna go back to that scene because I need it

2865
05:50:02,720 --> 05:50:04,720
You laugh for like five minutes

2866
05:50:09,120 --> 05:50:11,120
Sorry

2867
05:50:11,440 --> 05:50:13,440
Oh my god

2868
05:50:13,760 --> 05:50:15,760
No

2869
05:50:23,920 --> 05:50:28,240
Okay, okay, okay, I'll listen to it properly because my fucking u-block is like killing

2870
05:50:28,800 --> 05:50:31,680
The youtube like you ruined the wholesome moment

2871
05:50:32,000 --> 05:50:35,440
Like I didn't expect a random teardrop to like

2872
05:50:36,560 --> 05:50:41,920
Triangulate its way onto her face. Okay, she be is making a room. So we're gonna redirect into she be

2873
05:50:42,240 --> 05:50:46,640
Um, thank you to who said that she might possibly do a pop-up. Um

2874
05:50:48,720 --> 05:50:55,760
Literally, I did not expect that teardrop. I think because of the serious nature kind of of the stream as well

2875
05:50:55,920 --> 05:50:57,920
It made it just like extra hilarious

2876
05:50:59,280 --> 05:51:01,920
Um, her face had to literally be on top

2877
05:51:02,080 --> 05:51:07,040
I think it was just the angle that the tear would have had to have been to hit her face

2878
05:51:07,600 --> 05:51:10,160
And like it was such a serious moment

2879
05:51:10,800 --> 05:51:12,800
and my brain was like

2880
05:51:13,120 --> 05:51:15,600
tear went a little to the left and

2881
05:51:17,280 --> 05:51:21,040
That laugh legit lifted my spirits. I'm gonna need to listen to the film

2882
05:51:21,120 --> 05:51:24,080
I'll cut it and put on sweater and just be like

2883
05:51:24,880 --> 05:51:30,480
POV a tear dropping on an anime girl's face made me burst out laughing for three minutes

2884
05:51:31,360 --> 05:51:33,360
because uh, yeah

2885
05:51:37,600 --> 05:51:44,080
This strontism hit hard. I literally looked back at it and I was like, it was not that funny. It was not that funny

2886
05:51:46,320 --> 05:51:51,200
As much as I like to pretend that I'm funny see he hilarious. It was not that funny

2887
05:51:52,640 --> 05:51:54,640
Hey, YouTube keeps making an album

2888
05:51:56,000 --> 05:51:58,000
Okay, it looks like

2889
05:51:58,640 --> 05:52:01,040
The waiting room is up for shooters

2890
05:52:02,640 --> 05:52:04,640
She's reading fanfiction

2891
05:52:07,520 --> 05:52:09,520
Uh

2892
05:52:12,960 --> 05:52:14,960
Right, okay

2893
05:52:17,280 --> 05:52:19,200
Um

2894
05:52:19,200 --> 05:52:21,200

For the hilarity

2897
05:52:24,880 --> 05:52:26,320
That was

2898
05:52:26,320 --> 05:52:28,000
The weird yandere anime

2899
05:52:28,000 --> 05:52:31,280
I believe if you guys are vouching for for vivi then

2900
05:52:31,920 --> 05:52:34,560
It's definitely gonna be a bit better next time around

2901
05:52:34,560 --> 05:52:37,840
I do apologize if you found it a distasteful pick

2902
05:52:38,800 --> 05:52:42,000
I am ignorant. I mean you can't it's not like you can watch 10 out 10

2903
05:52:42,720 --> 05:52:47,840
Anime 10 out 10 all the time. Are you gonna do anime movies? Absolutely. I'm so down to that

2904
05:52:48,880 --> 05:52:54,640
Um, she's finishing my immortal Harry Potter fan site. Never seen Vivi so thank you for the stream

2905
05:52:54,640 --> 05:52:57,760
I'm really good anime recommend. No, thank you. That was like a hoot holler

2906
05:52:58,400 --> 05:53:04,320
And I carry on too. Um, thank you again husky and a 50 mt for the gifted subs

2907
05:53:05,520 --> 05:53:07,520
Um

2908
05:53:09,760 --> 05:53:11,040
Uh

2909
05:53:11,040 --> 05:53:16,400
Let's watch the trashes of trash anime snakes. I don't even think it would be able to hold my like

2910
05:53:17,680 --> 05:53:19,680
My attention

2911
05:53:19,840 --> 05:53:26,240
Uh, it was great to be honest. The theme was the serving, but I kind of kept me wanting more. Yeah, like to see like how it's gonna go
