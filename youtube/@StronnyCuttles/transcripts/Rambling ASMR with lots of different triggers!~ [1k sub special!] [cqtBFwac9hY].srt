1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is my favorite kind of ASMR, so if you can bear with me and ask your cup of tea,

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I have a hell of a lot of tingles to show you.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm basically, I'm not really gonna be editin' out any like bumps and stuff so the audio's

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
more organic cause some people really like the rambling aspect and like the more, it's

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
not genuine but when you like hardcore edit something and make it like so professional

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
sometimes it can lose its charm because like you can hear me bump the microphone or for

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
example that noise you heard that was my thighs cause I'm currently like sitting on a chair

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
my legs up like not on the floor but I have an immersive array of kind of like ASMR tingles

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
to take you there, it's just kind of a little cutesy video I guess you can jump in the background

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but like you'll, you'll hear like this kind of noise in the back cause that's my table

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and it holds like over, I'm lookin' at it right now, it's probably got like 20 different

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
tingly things and that's with items because with ASMR you can use your bobo bobo boys

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
for tingles like repeat triggers or you can fall into the mic like see or I can actually

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
tap the mic like this or you can do ear goping like I get you know there's so much you can

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
freakin' do it it's amazing but I saw, I would literally surprise go one by one and just

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
kind of do a little ear cleaning with a brush this is just a generic, it's actually a brush

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:17,000
that came with Clean Your PC set and thank you to the radio microphone that I have

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the silicone ears, they actually sound pretty accurate to what you would hear like if you

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
press your actual ears and in real life you can hear the do do do like da da da da

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,000
hopefully I'm making sense but this is just this generic, general ear brush and you know

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
everyone, instead of everyone chase, everyone has different tingles so I may do something

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that's not really for you but this is kind of a quick, fire type of ASMR session so

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
don't you worry if you're like that sounds awful strongy, it's a lot to say awful

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
or maybe I should do a guest tingles, okay you'll never actually guess what this is

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
hear it, okay this is against your ear

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
if anyone said sponge, congrats I'm coming down, yeah because I don't even know how you would guess that's a sponge

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
honestly it just sounds like a crisp packet

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
did you tingle, did you, did you, did you, that's right, tingle harder for me

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
and okay, like I'm gonna be honest, you guys are probably like, you should probably use

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
grips all the time and a bloody should because this is for hands, I get too excited

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and then I break the freaking sound barrier because I'm gonna have to put a filter on this audio

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
so I'm not like going to lift what other tingles have I got

33
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:34,000
okay, listen to this right, this is, this is on here, it's a cotton ball but if I shove it in your ear canal

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
listen to this

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:53,000
please help me you're tingling

36
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
some people as fast as them are does well sometimes

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but I feel like I've, I've, I've attempted to make it in the past right

38
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but whenever I've done it I feel like I'm taking the best because like it's more supposed to be like nice

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and slow and relaxing here

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
so if I just shove up and go

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
how the fuck are you supposed to tingle for that, like honestly come with me

42
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:48,000
anyway, do you hear this, this is a plastic, plastic, uh, a silicon ball

43
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
there's tons of other silicon balls inside it

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and if I press it against your ear it sounds like you're under water with me

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
yeah look, because I'm a gottlefish, uh uh uh, okay

46
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
oh yeah

47
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
it's like a chair, I don't know what it is

48
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you like my putting that against your ear

49
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
hmm

50
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
oh yeah

51
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I admit I cooked with that one

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I found it in the thrush shop

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and I think I must say it's also a smartest use

54
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
it's always like I actually don't want to use that sound so when I look for one

55
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and I found out, I think this is probably like one of those 10, 10 tingles for me

56
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
there's some tingles that are like, sorry I'm gonna have to stand up to grab the next item

57
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
because, what the fuck was that noise?

58
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
so many

59
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
oh, I'll tell you all the popular ones

60
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
hair brushing is always popular

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
this is my, the pins on the brush, like peep peep peep

62
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
do you remember when Emmy's code name was pins?

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
hey hey hey

64
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
you guys all guessed she was a fiddle

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
but she's my fiddle doll

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
wow

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
do you remember when my code name went inks?

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
and then I call all you comments that are like

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
oh it's gonna be weird getting used to your name being so droney

70
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but I feel like it just made sense

71
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
because obviously I got to name everyone

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and I quite like literal names

73
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
this is just me being like babaga

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
but if like, feature verse come out and their names are like

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you know, bag of gaijin at the end when their English is being feature verse

76
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
and my name is gonna remember your name

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
oh, and then this is me being really hypocritical

78
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
because obviously I started naming them after French, right?

79
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
just a quick front there

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm called Coles because I'm a Coles

81
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
she be is literal because she's Shabari

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
she be, and then Colvin Bump because she has a tail

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
so she has Colin on her bum

84
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Emmy bees, oh, you know what, I've just said the most hypocritical thing

85
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
because Emmy's name is Japanese and French

86
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
her name means family because

87
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you know what, I'm gonna speak it back to the ASMR

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
because this is just me being a silly dude with

89
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
okay, so you can have like

90
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
earphones on the microphone like

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
but there are also

92
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
tools and apparatuses to make such a noise

93
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
so either this will be too fast to enjoy

94
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
but you

95
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
trying to make it too loud

96
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that's actually a really big behind the scenes thing

97
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
that I have to like stop talking

98
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and then do the tingle and then lure over the actual video

99
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
because some tingles are just far too loud

100
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to do at the same time stalking

101
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and then again it takes away from the organic appeal

102
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
of the video but like it's just kind of

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
the cookie crumbles in the nicest way

104
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm bumping fucking everything by the way

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
okay

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
so you hear me touch this

107
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
sounds better all along

108
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
what could it be

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
oh, fuck that up

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
it's like one of them frogs

111
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
he's actually a bit loud

112
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
look, I'm not really a big fan

113
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I can tap a slow feet with a wood

114
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and the wee wood thing actually likes that much more than

115
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
what the perky was designed for

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the hail, you know what

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
unironically though

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that's life, like you could be

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you're responding to do one thing

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but you're better at another thing, you know

121
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
so don't feel the pressure to be this thing that you're not

122
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
wow, we're getting philosophical

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and I'm smacking a wooden frog with a stick

124
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but I'm actually being for real though

125
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that's actually kind of true because I'll say this

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
over and over again

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I have problems reading and writing

128
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
my entire income and job is being paced around

129
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
reading and writing

130
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
so like, I'm not ever embarrassed about it

131
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
like, if you've ever watched me in a live stream

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
whenever I'd write something I have to read it for it to clear

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
like, if I wanted to spell A.C.'s name

134
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
her name is an I-C-E-Y

135
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
her name is I-C-E-Y-A

136
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
like, I would say it

137
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm like, I'm not even embarrassed about it

138
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
who gives a rat's fucking arms

139
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
oh, this is a Japanese ear cleaning tool

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I love, love, I love this trigger so much

141
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
don't worry, I'm gonna subtitle this video

142
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I love this trigger so freaking much

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
it's so good and fluffy

144
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and like, you can hear

145
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
as well, actually, while I've got you here

146
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm gonna show you the difference between an ear cleaner

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and a Japanese tool, if I'm not mistaken

148
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ear cleaner, okay, got it, got it, got it

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
okay

150
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
hold on, hold on

151
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
okay, I have three different things on my hand right now

152
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
this is Japanese ear cleaning tool

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
right

154
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and then this one is

155
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I want to do your most comment

156
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
this one's an ear cleaner

157
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
this is a Q-tip to Americans

158
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you see how it's different

159
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and then one more ear cleaning thing

160
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
this is a cotton pad

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
which is used for makeup removal in the ear

162
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
now an argument

163
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
okay, I just realized

164
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm leaving your other ear out, forgive me

165
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm so focused

166
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
but to hear the deepness

167
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that was the cotton pad

168
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I prefer deep ASMR sounds

169
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I find them relaxing

170
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and all that jazz

171
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
but I will say the Japanese ear cleaning tool

172
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
is so superior

173
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
like, I can't even find any

174
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and that's like, I would give it a 10 out of 10

175
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
definitely

176
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
oh, there's another 10 out of 10 organ I was saying

177
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
this is just like, literally a dropper bowl

178
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
yeah, peach

179
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't have any liquid in that

180
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
maybe you can help me along with like

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that's terrible, that's terrible

182
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
this is for tingling, this is for peachy

183
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
peachy 13, okay

184
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
we have some people who like

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
medical sounds, like medical role play

186
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and the level dropper bowl is like a pretty good

187
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
because like, sometimes an ASMR sound

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
doesn't even have to be something that is a tool of it

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
where the heck is me

190
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
and I've lost me glove

191
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I've got a little glove that I like to use

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think it makes like a really good sound

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
like, tell me, tell me it doesn't sound like you're in the nurse's office right now

194
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
like, come on

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
if I can get a one

196
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
are you ready for your prostate in my chin?

197
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
but yeah, I definitely like the latex

198
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
but like, in combination with the dropper

199
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
got to feel it mercy actually

200
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
no fingerprints, no traces left

201
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
got this, this is just me

202
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
just promoting everyone

203
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
then he made me, I think they blow off

204
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
unless

205
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
can I take your tapping on glove on?

206
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think it does look like a nice

207
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm a bit, I'm a bit biased, a bit partial

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I wouldn't say latex gloves are a 10 out of 10 tingle

209
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
but I would say they rank awfully high

210
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
okay, this one

211
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I hope you didn't hear that

212
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I hope I didn't ruin it

213
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
this one's a 10 out of 10

214
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
how

215
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
how much 10 out of 10

216
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
the problem with these

217
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
is you have to do it slowly

218
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
but you're against gravity

219
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
because like, if I just do it really quick

220
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
that's not tingly, is it?

221
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
get a t-fuck if it's tingly

222
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
must not make such a sound right now

223
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
did you hear that turtle for?

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but here you have to slow

225
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it's definitely a good one

226
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
isn't it?

227
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
one more

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I want to read, baby

229
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
what is all this going to do, ASMR or is that a purple one?

230
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
no, this is lab ASMR

231
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
of course I'm purple

232
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
okay, actually

233
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
that was so loud

234
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
don't worry, I'll edit it in post-production

235
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
so it doesn't break your ears

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
but that broke my ears

237
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
because I can hear myself into the microphone

238
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I use a Tascam to capture it

239
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm in a recording booth

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but it's such a waste of fucking money

241
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
but you can still hear me

242
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I've put earmuffs on you

243
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Vicky

244
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I like this sound

245
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I like this sound because it's so soft

246
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think the deeper noises

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
this is an example of a deeper noise tingle

248
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
that definitely has my

249
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
appreciation

250
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
because

251
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
when it's like soothing and deeper

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
like this is my theory

253
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but you didn't have to believe me

254
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
you didn't have to, it's just me

255
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
because it's just me, the original

256
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
but I think ASMR

257
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
is also locked into

258
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
you don't want a baby to come soon

259
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
and you have to like

260
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
get soothed by like really loud noises

261
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
and all of that

262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I think that comfort

263
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
possibly is linked to the

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
comfort that ASMR can bring

265
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
not the tingles, not the tingles

266
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
but the comfort

267
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
which is why these deeper noises

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
are so unbelievably soothing

269
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
because that was

270
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
literally the first like

271
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
state of

272
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
just pure bliss, you know

273
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
like when you were in your most

274
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
tummy

275
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
you didn't have to pay taxes

276
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
you didn't have to

277
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
like any work

278
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
or even a concert

279
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you just sat there

280
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and you were like

281
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
who should give you all the nutrients

282
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and you passed like shit

283
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to the political court

284
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I mean god

285
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
what could you ask for more in life

286
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
but that's my Thomas theory what I know T

287
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I just don't know much about

288
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
you know what

289
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
just because you don't know something

290
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
doesn't mean you can't

291
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
you can't make a statement

292
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
that's wrong and loud ok

293
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I raised my case

294
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
this is where I make my stand

295
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm looking over the mic now

296
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
to see if there's other triggers

297
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I've messed up on and there is

298
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
if I can teach it

299
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
don't make me

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
just making you notice

301
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
ok I know I did brush in earlier

302
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but I actually have another brush

303
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
compared to this brush I used earlier

304
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
like right

305
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
but this is a makeup brush

306
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
this one and it's so much softer

307
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
so soft

308
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I do that's another point as well

309
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so you don't have to only use

310
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
some more trigger

311
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
doing two at the same time

312
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
is like so good

313
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
so that's one with a brush

314
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
and the other just

315
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
my hand going over the ear

316
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and I'm going

317
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not that good at doing triggers

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I have a really spitty mouth

319
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
like I'm self-failing on and off

320
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
so it makes it a bit hard to do

321
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
like so then vocal

322
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
like talking ASMR because my mouth

323
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
always clicks like

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
with spit

325
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and I don't think it's very easy

326
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and I know I don't get me wrong

327
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
there's things called D-Clicker

328
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
which it first can like use to get rid of

329
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
but mine is like

330
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
so fake it's wrong I just rather

331
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
restart my whole sentence

332
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
you've never noticed there's like

333
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
none in this video in particular

334
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
but probably much more likely in other videos

335
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
there'll be like a cut

336
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
my mood just slightly shifts

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
because I've had to resource it

338
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
because my mouth won't stop

339
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
going go go go go

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and clicking

341
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
wait please give me a break

342
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm tired

343
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm tired boss

344
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
okay what else

345
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm pretty sure I saw a few others

346
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
um

347
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
alright

348
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that was a good one

349
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
alright

350
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
one is like some professional

351
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
um

352
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
okay this one is

353
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
a cup

354
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
like it's literally just a plastic ass cup

355
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
but the reason why I like it

356
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
is because

357
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
if I put it over your ear

358
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
that sounds like fucking shit

359
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
it sounds so much better in person

360
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm just gonna have to come here

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
to show you how much that was awful

362
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
okay this is an old

363
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
plastic phone case

364
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
so

365
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
you know you can do fingerprint

366
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
it's more like this is just my finger

367
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
being pressed against it

368
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
like in like the

369
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
the center of my skin

370
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
um or

371
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
obviously you can do your little nails

372
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
against it

373
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and uh

374
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
just

375
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
whatever your amounts is

376
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I hope this has been enough for

377
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I feel like I've just yapped a bit

378
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm so unmasked in our time

379
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm just

380
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm just gonna have to lure and edit the volume

381
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
under the case that I've made an ASMR audio

382
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and the reality is

383
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
it's just another yap this from

384
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
here's truly

385
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
honestly I prefer to act quite

386
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
like this one

387
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
when I say it's a 10 out of 10

388
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I think you know what

389
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I've had fake nails on and like

390
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the would hit a bit better

391
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
cause

392
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
cause fake nails like give that availability

393
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
of just sounding

394
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
better in more

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
but

396
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I also have this

397
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
fluffy thing that I can put on

398
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
against the

399
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
ear

400
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
ear

401
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
but yes I'll talk to you on that

402
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
so you'll be able to sound like

403
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
often on my ear

404
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and thank you

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
all of you baby

406
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll listen to some people like

407
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
when they can hear my breathing

408
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
so

409
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't

410
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
fuck

411
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I guess breathing can be so

412
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
like I used

413
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
to get my eyelashes done

414
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and the lady obviously had to be in

415
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
close proximity

416
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and she would just be turning and I'd

417
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
like

418
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
because she was just like near me breathing

419
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and I'm like I'm at a weird door

420
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
for getting tingles from breathing ASMR

421
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
but

422
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it is what it is

423
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you don't pick the tingles

424
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
the tingles pick you

425
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
what else am I going to

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm sure of course I don't know

427
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
sorry I was scratching my thigh there

428
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I have some like

429
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
it's not really

430
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
not tingling this is a

431
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
plastic pouch

432
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
it has a little click

433
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
oh that size is breaking

434
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
my sound barrier

435
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
oh dear

436
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
that one didn't

437
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
if you didn't know the task gun

438
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
will flash red

439
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
like

440
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
if I'm being too loud

441
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
it's like oh my god your tingles

442
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
are out of control lady

443
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
and so I know

444
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
when I'm being a bit too loud

445
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
but I can't see the task gun

446
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
in like every recording session

447
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
it's just not possible because of my setup

448
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
although I don't know if I should record

449
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
on my pc

450
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
but

451
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
yeah I'm toying

452
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
maybe you like plastic

453
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
fingerprints

454
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
actually sounds pretty sticky

455
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
actually kind of like that

456
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
yeah you like my sticky

457
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
fingers being on you

458
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
now there is

459
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
an ASMR

460
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
this noise

461
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
is really hard to capture

462
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I have

463
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
two

464
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
wooden ear picks

465
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
but wooden ear picking ASMR

466
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is really fake and hard to capture

467
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
it's just because

468
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
it sounds like I'm

469
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
fingering your ear or something

470
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
this one actually do have to like

471
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
focus a little bit on your ear

472
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
but either this is

473
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
good or just kind of sounds like

474
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm brushing some around on my ear

475
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
but

476
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I promise

477
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I have two wooden ear picks

478
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
oh I can maybe

479
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
add tweezers

480
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
hold on

481
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
some people like tweezers

482
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
sounds but

483
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that's the only sound they make

484
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
they don't like make a natural sound

485
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I think

486
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
for visual ASMR

487
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I would make some visual ASMR

488
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
and I can show you many

489
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
else

490
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
cause I like

491
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
my nails so

492
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
yeah for you

493
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
well yes

494
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
mister

495
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
your ears are delightfully clean

496
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
but there's nothing

497
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
that

498
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
is bad what

499
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
sounds I'm going with here

500
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
try to see your ears are clean

501
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
but I'll just clean them further

502
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
which makes no sense

503
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
but that's okay

504
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm allowed to be dumb

505
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and I

506
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
forgive myself

507
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
yeah

508
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
you like the way those ear picks and tweezers

509
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
feel that's right

510
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
no

511
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I mean

512
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I would say I did a decent

513
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
thing over here

514
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
how long have we been recording for

515
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I have no idea

516
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
how long have I been there in minutes

517
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I've been yapping for 30 minutes

518
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
why have you left me yapping for so long

519
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
what the hell

520
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
how has it been 30 minutes

521
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
oh my god I've got problems

522
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
seriously

523
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I mean maybe it's less

524
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
but because I had to edit some stuff

525
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I hope

526
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm leaving my tummy noises in

527
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
so

528
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
hopefully

529
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
you're asleep by now

530
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
and if you're not then

531
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'll be hearing so many awful eyes away

532
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and

533
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I'll just put it away

534
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
for a little bit

535
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't know

536
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
okay

537
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
wait I'm sure I had a few more tangles

538
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
wait don't go yet don't leave

539
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I want to show you more

540
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
okay

541
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I see

542
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I said I see

543
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
no I say

544
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I said I say snow pose

545
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I said I see visually

546
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
okay I'll call it three more triggers

547
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and then I'll let you go

548
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
okay I'll let you go

549
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
you do it in the ear

550
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
okay

551
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
okay you heard me move one of them

552
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
but don't

553
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
this one

554
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
it's like a little

555
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
water thing

556
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and I can just

557
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
that went on my face

558
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I didn't realize it was pointed on me

559
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
so

560
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I can't do it against the ears a little bit

561
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but you know

562
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
no one wants to put water in your very

563
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
expensive equipment

564
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
this equipment was expensive

565
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
was it worth it? I don't know yet

566
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
but yeah

567
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
oh yeah

568
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
oh I can do it

569
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
oh

570
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
yeah

571
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
oh you feel so refreshed

572
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
listen up to this ASMR

573
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
okay the other one

574
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
this one's quite loud so I might not talk

575
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
too much during it because I'll need to lower

576
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
the volume

577
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
but I got

578
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
pop rocks I'm not going to do it

579
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
but like I'm going to shake the packet

580
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
of the pop rocks

581
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm not being funny I was so

582
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
unbelievably loud

583
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
okay last angle

584
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and this one's a 10 out of 10 for me

585
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
okay

586
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
you can totally hear it actually

587
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
oh oh oh

588
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
are you ready?

589
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
see

590
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
so

591
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
so

592
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
why did you think

593
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I was double

594
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
ASMR and it's like

595
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
what's one of my top 10's as well

596
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But if you're not asleep by now, I'm not sure what I can do.

597
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Um, I could keep down that tingle until you are asleep.

598
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Would that be fine?

599
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Like, I wouldn't talk anymore.

600
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Cause I feel like if I keep talking, this was keeping you awake.

601
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Cause you're like, what's the next tingle, strongy?

602
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Um, right, I'll make you a deal.

603
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You close your eyes, you're nice and comfy.

604
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I will keep tickling you to prove that tickling ASMR is like one of the superior triggers.

605
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Because like, breathing is good and all like,

606
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:56,000
or, but I think tickling in this case, okay, I just need to prove it's superior.

607
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So, I'll let you go now.

608
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But thank you for listening to me rubble for 30 minutes.

609
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Cause I eat always 30, 5 minutes.

610
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Okay, jish, jish, my shish.

611
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay, I'll let you go.

612
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And I'm going to tickling ASMR.

613
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And I'll see you on the other side, okay?

614
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Bye.

615
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Can I do it?

616
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm going to let you do ASMR ear kiss.

617
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Just one, just one kiss, okay?

618
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But what ear should I do it on?

619
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
This one.

620
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And this one.

621
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I feel biased to this ear.

622
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Good night.

623
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Good night.

624
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Good night.

625
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Good night.

626
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Good night.
