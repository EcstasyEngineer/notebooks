1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Oh, Voidling. Oh, you came and you've watched me after I did the live stream.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:15,920
Even though sometimes it's not fun when I'm lying. But I know I stream at really bad times.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,440
But I still love you, Voidling.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:29,440
You've got your own melody today. Oh, it is that melody.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,440
I can't hear the background of the game. But I hope it sounds...

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Oh, my mic. Hold on.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Yeldon. Yeldon. Yeldon. Right, okay. My microphone's back at the mouth.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440
Unfortunately, my voice is still broken. But hey, Vo.

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,440
That's what you get if you don't raise your voice. Oh, what do you mean?

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
I'm supposed to be raising my voice in between streams. What are you fucking...

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
What are you... What will you... What will you be talking about, you one?

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon.

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,440
I'm totally not opening up a box of shapes right now because I got a delivery.

14
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,440
I got me food.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,440
A silent stream would go crazy.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,440
Unfortunately, my voice is still broken. Now, obviously, let's talk about the elephant in the room.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Please, ladies and gentlemen, give me a little bit of credit.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Do you think I didn't plan for this kind of thing? I assure you everything's gonna be okay at the end of the day.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Please do relax and enjoy that your little sister's having a wee bit of time off, okay? Relax.

20
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
It's okay.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,440
I assure you, even though I am very low IQ, I have planned for these things.

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,440
I know the results of these things. Everything's okay.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,440
No, Veeler are not gonna be opening up their own fucking live stream platform that you can do what you want.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,440
No, that's... No, no. Okay.

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,440
But don't worry. Give... Give it 48 hours, okay?

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,440
And then wherever the result is, is the result.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Okay, so don't worry. Mummy knows what to do. Mother knows best.

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,440
One of you has probably understood that reference because that's a Rapunzel.

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Rapunzel, uh, Rapun... Mummy.

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,440
Oh my God, call me Nicocado, avocado. I am always two steps ahead.

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Oh, that's terrible. Anyway, I apologize for how broken my voice is.

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Obviously, under unique circumstances, I will actually be on time for once today.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,440
I've got two hours of this game. I don't know how long it takes.

34
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I was just gonna muck about in yapties in the background as always.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,440
And then we are watching Austin Powers as a membership stream and then I'm...

36
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm jumping offline to deal with the background stuff.

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,440
But if you... You know, it's already... It's gone through the appeal process.

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
I've messaged a few old friends that have contacts at YouTube. Hopefully one of them can pull through.

39
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Please don't worry, okay? It's just a new account. That's it.

40
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
That's literally it. Have you not seen what happened?

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,440
You can open up a new account.

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,440
It's not perma-ban. People seem to assume it's perma-ban if it's for factual policies.

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,440
It's not perma-ban.

44
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,440
I'll let you know on one thing though. It was like...

45
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,440
You have up until 2029 to appeal it.

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,440
So the data is collected for five years before they finally purge it from the servers.

47
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,440
So, yeah, you can still argue for the account for a very long time.

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,440
So please don't worry, Pinpals, that you're gonna be okay. You'll be fine.

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Obviously I did speak to Emma when I woke up a wee bit. She's okay.

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,440
She's just a bit shocked and I said, don't worry. I didn't expect it either.

51
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,440
She didn't get a third strike.

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,440
That's the fact of the matter. Check the emails. There was no third strike issue.

53
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,440
So we get to argue about that. So let's see what the result is.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,440
But again, please don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. It's me.

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,440
I know, I know, but strongy, you're so low IQ, you can hardly string a sentence together.

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Now, yes, that is the truth. How dare you one? How dare you say that so confidently out loud?

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Two, come on. I planned a lude agency.

58
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Of course, I thought a little bit of a head of what might happen if someone was a bit too low.

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Okay? So please don't worry. Pinpals, you're gonna be just fine. Okay?

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
You'll be just fine.

61
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
My fellow mergers.

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,440
No third strike. No. There was not a third strike issue for the channel to be closed.

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Okay, I'm a monk for a quick club.

64
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,440
I love cooking, creamy soup.

65
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Look at that. Don't worry.

66
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm obviously a communicator.

67
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I'm pulling all the strings I can.

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,440
Because obviously it would suck if you had to start fresh, but...

69
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,440
I feel a little better after you saying that. Yes, please don't worry.

70
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Honestly, I know I'm low IQ. I know I'm daft. I know I'm not very smart.

71
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,440
But I have a wee bit of faith in me. Just a wee bit, all right?

72
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
No more eating.

73
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,440
I can't see the awesome power stream. It is gonna be... I'll put it up. I'll put it up.

74
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Actually, I could message management to put it up for me.

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Okay.

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440
I have a bit more exciting news. We've gotten invited to a convention.

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
I forgot about this part. Right.

78
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,440
We're playing a game called Chain Together, but there's no togetherness. It's just me.

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,440
But that's because I'm a lazy sod.

80
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,440
I played this in a collab, but I actually found it rather satisfying.

81
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Yes, a convention. Obviously, before we announce anything, we will get it confirmed.

82
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Mummy, you can't... Wait, you guys go to conventions?

83
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,440
It's gonna be via the internet. Via the internet. Not physical. Not physical.

84
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,440
We're not molesting you just yet. Hold on.

85
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Sadness is leaving. Thank you. Now only rage remains. Yes.

86
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
There's obviously...

87
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Not in real life, Frank.

88
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Oh, yeah. No, no. Sorry. I forgot that...

89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,440
I forgot that you people go outside.

90
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,440
No, it's like an internet one where they're gonna...

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I don't know what it comes from. It's the first time I've ever done anything like that.

92
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,440
And I've not got a Scooby-Doo what any of this is or how it works or that.

93
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,440
I've been invited. I just need to extend my hand and see what the fuck happens after.

94
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Because I don't know how to get the girls to scoot about on those robot things.

95
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Those are hilarious, but they cost too much money.

96
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I think you have to rent it, which honestly makes perfect sense.

97
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,440
So it might be one of those things where we're all chilling at a booth talking to you.

98
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,440
People go outside. We go outside. That's what I'm asking you.

99
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,440
I didn't realize you thought it was an in real life convention. Where would you show up?

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:44,440
No. If the girls and I meet up, the likelihood is they're coming to me.

101
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,440
And we'll do an off-collapse for one week straight, just constant.

102
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,440
Would the con be in real life? No, it would be online. It would be via the internet.

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,440
If the girls and I meet up, 99% sure they're all coming to Australia.

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
They're all coming to see me down under.

105
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,440
And I'll show them the Aussie way. I'll teach them the HSPs and all that.

106
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Hold on, I'm trying to drink my tea. Can you hear my little nails on it?

107
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Veiler Mansion confirmed? I mean Mansion for a week, if they won.

108
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Oh no, if the girls, like, if we genuinely did that off-collab, you wouldn't know the best part about it.

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,440
It can be expensed! It can be expensed!

110
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,440
I can get fucking taxed back on the price of their plane tickets and shit.

111
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Shadow Wizard Money Gang. We love being registered as a business.

112
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Do you want to know what other things you can do as a business?

113
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,440
You can go to Japan and call it cultural experience for your work.

114
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,440
And guess what? Oh, I didn't expect that.

115
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,440
That can be right off as well! Let's go! We love anime girls up in this bitch!

116
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,440
But yes, there's another off-collab. I'm afraid they'll be having to come to me.

117
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,440
But I would get PCs and stuff so the girls can have their own PCs signed in and stuff and do off-collabs.

118
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
And obviously I'm going to force them to lick my microphone!

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Whoa, that sounds like a euphemism. But it's not. It's not a real euphemism at all.

120
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,440
It's actually what I mean.

121
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Yeah, tax write off hotel. Oh, geez, I gave my fright.

122
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Hold on, wait. I have the teleport thing on. How do I put it on?

123
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Escape. Near safe location. If your character is stuck, highest point unlocked. Yeah, do that.

124
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay, good. This is just a yap and all that.

125
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
If one of my friends is like a TikTok, does that work as a write-off?

126
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,440
One of my friends is like, yes, so if you're a TikTok creator, an influencer, whatever you want to call it,

127
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,440
what content they might use. So for example, if you're a nicocaddo, avocado,

128
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:15,440
you can write off the tax you get on food because you can show that you make content with that food.

129
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,440
As long as you can claim it. Now, I obviously don't claim... Oh, that's silly of me.

130
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I obviously don't claim absolutely everything because I order quite a lot of outrageous things

131
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,440
such as an ice mold that is currently in the freezer right now waiting for the day to be used.

132
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Whoa, why am I struggling? Bruh, I'm on my own. Why am I struggling so much with this one?

133
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Trips, well, if you can prove that you're made up, made content, made you income, made you this, made you that,

134
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,440
was fruitful, then yes, you can. But don't take... Wait, hold on a minute, hold on, allegedly.

135
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Hold on a minute. Do not take advice from a fucking cuttlefish on the internet about how to claim your taxes.

136
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:08,440
This is how it works for me. I have accountants and I've been in two countries now with a registered business

137
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,440
and, you know, the accountants in both countries were like, this is how it works.

138
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Do not take advice from a cuttlefish. How do I keep doing the same thing over and over?

139
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,440
And expecting a different result. Over the internet for your thing, it sounds quite taxing.

140
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Thank you, thank you. No, seriously.

141
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Oh, for goodness... I'm having a stroke, sorry, I'm trying to talk to you.

142
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,440
This is why this is a YAPStream, okay? This is why it's a YAPStream.

143
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,440
But yes, hopefully, Pin Pills, you feel a bit rest assured.

144
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,440
As dumb as I am, I know, I know, please do understand that.

145
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,440
I have known about this as a very high possibility and please, no panic.

146
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
There's nothing to panic about.

147
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,440
As I said, factual policies do not get you perma-ban on YouTube.

148
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Things like hate speech and all that get perma-ban.

149
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:22,440
As far as I'm aware, Emmy hasn't addressed how much she hates a certain video game franchises.

150
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440
It's like a love-hate relationship, really.

151
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Tax evasion? No!

152
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,440
It's like tax evasion is illegal, but tax avoidance is illegal, but tax evasion is fine or something like that?

153
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Something really silly.

154
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
My ping is 200, I can't believe it.

155
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Oh, I have that short to upload.

156
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Reeflings, you guys are gonna be feasting very, very well.

157
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:02,440
So after the Austin Power, I'm basically pre-recordin' like five, six shorts, maybe even eight,

158
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,440
that are like, hopefully, high quality, wink, wink, me and high quality, name of worst duo.

159
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,440
No, you're ping!

160
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Oh, that was a joke from, I did a collab and I thought that was my ping.

161
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,440
And it was not my ping, it was the high, how high we pinged.

162
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
All of us had 300 ping and the MISMA was like, erm, no.

163
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,440
This is a really satisfying gameplay in solo.

164
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Like, it actually is, I don't care what anyone says.

165
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Sorry, I'm making an e-girl version of this right now.

166
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,440
I need Catarina to fund it though.

167
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Her mafia monies to fund it, cause this is a...

168
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,440
It's like really satisfying, like getting to the next bit and then it's like, oh no, I lost progress.

169
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Oh wait, no I didn't.

170
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:02,440
It's like really, if you don't end up having to like, climb on the barrel, it's really, erm, thingy.

171
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,440
How's your day been? It's just started!

172
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
My day started with you, obviously.

173
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I woke up and I was like, hmm, something's not right, something's in the air, what's going on?

174
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,440
And then I saw Shivi actually, Shivi was the reason I found out about it.

175
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Cause she was like, I'm so worried and I'm like, oh, why are you...

176
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Oh, I did not mean to do that. I was like, oh, don't be worried.

177
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,440
It is much smoother than being tethered to three people, honestly.

178
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Mummy's so independent, she doesn't need anime girls to finish.

179
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,440
This is really satisfying to play on your own.

180
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,440
I'm getting a little serotonin boost the higher I get, you know?

181
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
This woman is one of the three reasons why I'm still alive. Ask her to god.

182
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
You know what?

183
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I hope things get better, fuck yeah.

184
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,440
And also, you should look forward to like, the next video games that come out.

185
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,440
Oh! Apparently that new short video game came out that's like, ballerin'.

186
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Solo chain together equals only act, exactly.

187
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Who's serotonin?

188
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Oh, someone sent me a marshmallow. I'm so sorry to disappoint you, little reflin.

189
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,440
A reflin sent me a marshmallow and they were like, are we going to have a certain science member join?

190
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
And I think you're talking about uneology that I designed on that stream.

191
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,440
No, my nails are not after uneology.

192
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,440
But that girl's design has been ranked the second most favourite so far.

193
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Are you going to play Concord? Aren't they not melted?

194
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
No, not Deadlock. A different one.

195
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,440
The one by, I don't know what's going on but this is a good accent.

196
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Thanks, it's Scottish, I spawned in with it. It's really good.

197
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Whoa, almost got spanked by that wire.

198
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,440
No, it was that other video game by that streamer.

199
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Oh my god, mail streamer mentioned.

200
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,440
But it was made by a video game streamer.

201
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Can you hold on, thank you.

202
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Space Marines, Spectre. It must be Spectre, and it has like $90 skins.

203
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,440
And then a clip of him went viral because he was like, I don't think $4,000 is a lot for a mattress.

204
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,440
And everyone was like, what?

205
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,440
What do you mean $4,000 isn't a lot for a mattress?

206
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,440
That's like people's rent and then some. That's insane.

207
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
To spend on a mattress?

208
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,440
And then everyone was like, oh yeah, this guy went to private school and was like, oh, that's why he said that.

209
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:47,440
But he said like the skins were really expensive and stuff in the game.

210
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,440
But honestly, controversial take. The game actually didn't look that horrific to me.

211
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Oh god, it's a dragon.

212
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
Hi.

213
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Go grease landing, we're burning up the quarter mile.

214
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Grease landing, go grease landing.

215
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Dream boom boom, she can mean boom boom.

216
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Grease landing.

217
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
God, MISMA did this.

218
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,440
I'm like 99% sure MISMA drove this.

219
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
Okay.

220
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Whoa, this is fun.

221
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,440
It's like getting my driver's license without having to do the driver part.

222
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Sorry, this is actually so satisfying.

223
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
This is such a good game.

224
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Kailua, thank you for the 20.

225
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
Oh my god, thanks for your super chat, Terry.

226
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
It's mine now.

227
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,440
All non-tax advice is like super happy you've gotten this group together.

228
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
They're all so sweet and I'm really happy.

229
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Talking to y'all.

230
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
All the lovable MISMA on it.

231
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Oh, thank you.

232
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
I'm glad you like my girlies.

233
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
I love them to smithereens.

234
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
They're precious.

235
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Oh, oh, I'm edging it.

236
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm getting edged.

237
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Okay, we made it.

238
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
Oh, I'm glad you like them.

239
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,440
And thank you, Kailua, for the 20s.

240
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
For your tip and your super chat.

241
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Right, let me finish this tea.

242
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
This tea.

243
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Okay, uh-uh.

244
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
I'm tired of drinking room temperature tea.

245
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
I said it.

246
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,440
And I'm going to try and take some photos for no particular reason after string.

247
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Sorry, my voice just cracked if you heard that.

248
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,440
15 is the most I would ever spend on a skin.

249
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
But that's pushing out.

250
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
God, imagine if you ever collabed with a game and it had skins in it.

251
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I'd buy it.

252
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Oh, I'd love that.

253
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:40,440
I saw Vishojo collabed with that game.

254
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,440
You know the one that get mobile.

255
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Smay.

256
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Smay.

257
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
And I was like that.

258
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
I was like, oh my God.

259
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Fricking congratulations to them.

260
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,440
That's the coolest thing I've ever fricking seen.

261
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
Um, you know, not my game type.

262
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
I'd be fucking playing it about my skin.

263
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
I put it that way.

264
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
Damn, Brian.

265
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Super happy you've gotten this group together.

266
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Good morning, Brian.

267
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Jeez.

268
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,440
I'm really happy talking to all of you.

269
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
All the love to Mama Stromi.

270
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Ah.

271
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Thank you, Niddle, for the tip.

272
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Brian, do you want to read it out or will I read it out?

273
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
You don't seem awake this morning, Brian.

274
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Some coffee.

275
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Speaking of upcoming games, Silent Hill 2 Remake coming out next month.

276
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Can't wait to see if Bloober team did a good job.

277
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Is their team called Bloober?

278
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm investing my stonks right now.

279
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,440
You want to play Shiba in college?

280
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Um, look, as much as, you know, we've done rather well, I don't think we're that influential.

281
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,440
Although, did you see that tweet from Princess and Despire?

282
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
That new game that came out.

283
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,440
They were like, oh, if you can't afford your game, just pirate it.

284
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
It's no skin off of our nose.

285
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,440
And I'm like, damn, I want to be a game studio like you, the fuck?

286
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,440
They were like, yeah, if you don't have the money, you can buy it later when you do type thing.

287
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I was like, fuck it.

288
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Hell based on rent.

289
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Right.

290
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Okay, then one, two, three, jump.

291
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
One, two, three.

292
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,440
One, two, three.

293
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,440
One, two, three.

294
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
One, two, three.

295
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,440
One.

296
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Oh, that scared me.

297
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
I did not see that.

298
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
I.

299
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,160
I didn't even- I never even saw those!

300
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,040
I fucking went right for it!

301
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
RID.

302
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Okay.

303
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Wait!

304
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,040
They updated- this wasn't in the multiplayer!

305
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Is it because I'm playing solo and I'm being punished?

306
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,040
Oh my god, they're punishing me for being mildly good at the game.

307
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
How dare they?

308
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm being punished for winning!

309
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,240
I don't remember that in the colour.

310
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
RID.

311
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Oh my god, wait!

312
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
They're so smart!

313
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,240
They've adapted the map for solo players.

314
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Brian!

315
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Okay, Brian clearly needs a bit of coffee.

316
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
You're taking a moment now, Brian.

317
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Do you need to go back to sleep?

318
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Is it too early for you?

319
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,240
By the way, before you're like, who the fuck is Brian?

320
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Brian is the name of the TTS.

321
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Okay.

322
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Oh, that's a trampoline.

323
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Oh, right.

324
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Okay, let's go.

325
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
Deep beat.

326
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Time and time again, it's been proven that piracy is good for-

327
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
There is another game dev studio that did that.

328
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,240
I can't even remember its name though.

329
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,240
They were just like, ah, you win, basically.

330
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
But it wasn't in a mean way.

331
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,240
It was just like, in a- oh my god, please, don't.

332
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
Stop!

333
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,240
This is like the most inefficient way to do it, the anime!

334
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
No, no, no, no!

335
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Big jump!

336
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Big jump!

337
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Hey, Brian has over 9000 thing right now.

338
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
That voice comes from everywhere in nowhere.

339
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Yeah, so Brian's the name of the text to speech.

340
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,240
And he is the one who commentates everything.

341
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,240
All the dough knows on stream for me.

342
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
And that's why I say Brian.

343
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,240
So if your name happens to be Brian, you might be rather fond of my streams,

344
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
because I tell him off.

345
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,240
I go, Brian, when he interrupts me.

346
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,240
So yeah, if your name is Brian, congrats.

347
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,240
You have won the lottery of chance that I might say your name at random.

348
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,240
I am going to do a Pokemon stream in the future.

349
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:48,240
And on Marshmallow, you can put your name if you want.

350
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I've got to put this wrong this bit.

351
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Oh wait, no, it's like up to the ground.

352
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,240
Going to talk into the dev team to get your own custom voice right now.

353
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Yeah, I was going to do a Pokemon stream, but you have to put your name in Marshmallow,

354
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
but you're not allowed to sign it.

355
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
I don't want anyone, if you sign it automatically in the bin, I'm not pulling from that name.

356
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm going to put all your names in a randomizer for the Pokemon stream,

357
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,240
and I'll show it on stream, like randomize it, and we'll take it from there.

358
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,240
By the way, Stronio, Vishojo collabed with Nike 2 a few months ago.

359
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
Quite a few of the girls covers.

360
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Oh my god, that's fantastic!

361
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,240
Freakin' Iron Mouse has been absolutely killing it.

362
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,240
She came out with that song, it was like Pop Candy.

363
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,240
I don't know if you've seen the music video, I watched it like a lot.

364
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,240
And it was like that Pop Candy.

365
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Oh for fuck's sake, I can't remember any of it.

366
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
It was like so good.

367
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,240
I was going to say, oh, did you like Amy's cover of Fortnite Metal Pass?

368
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Can you understand why it was stuck in my head for so long now?

369
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
It was so good.

370
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,240
It will return very shortly.

371
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
A Devil Anarchy?

372
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,240
It was like the one where she was in a...

373
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,240
I think I'm above.

374
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
And I'm booted up my PC!

375
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Yes, honestly, I'm going to get a lot of behind the scenes work.

376
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
I want to do Mimi's song covers as well.

377
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,240
I'm just going to test it, and if they don't go anywhere, then I'll just focus on other stuff.

378
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,240
So when you say my name without signing, do you mean like my first real name?

379
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Yes, so when we play Pokemon, I can obviously name the Pokemon after you.

380
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,240
And I will...

381
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Well, I was actually going to get...

382
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,240
No, I mean, I see to sing that, why is this dealer taking the piss?

383
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,240
Because I love Amy's voice.

384
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,240
And I thought it'd be really funny if she covered it.

385
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Like in her reaction, why is this dealer?

386
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Yeah.

387
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Oh, Brian, you're late!

388
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I already know.

389
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Brian, stop it.

390
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Thank you, Nero, for the tip.

391
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,240
Brian, as in he came, what's going on with you, son?

392
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Yeah, so you put your real names, and then I'll name the Pokemon at random after you.

393
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
But I'll have a randomizer so that...

394
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I don't know how that went so well.

395
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,240
So then there's a chance I can be like, Adam, go to battle!

396
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Or whatever your name might be.

397
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,240
But yes, not your online handle, your actual real name.

398
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,240
That's why there's no one allowed to sign on it.

399
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Because if you go like, ha, my name is...

400
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,240
My name is...

401
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
And this is my username.

402
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Disqualified.

403
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,240
But don't worry, I'll tweet about it or I'll say about it.

404
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Like way before the Pokemon stream.

405
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,240
The Pokemon streams aren't until October if I'm not mistaken.

406
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,240
Unless someone's got my schedule right now that I leaked.

407
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
I don't think Pokemon...

408
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
The Pokemon's in October.

409
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,240
I was gonna play Pokemon Ruby...

410
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Pokemon Black...

411
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Or way, I don't know what one you want me...

412
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Only first name, don't put your...

413
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Yeah, please don't give me your full legal name, your social security number,

414
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
and the four digits on the back of your card.

415
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I do not need that to name a Pokemon.

416
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,240
As much as it would be nice to come and teleport to you.

417
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,240
No, I do not need that to name Pokemon that I catch.

418
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,240
No, not you joking about it as soon as I typed it.

419
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
Black or white stream base?

420
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Yeah, I played Pokemon Ruby, Pokemon Black or White.

421
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
And I played the...

422
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Is Pokemon Black or White Gen 5?

423
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
I did Gen 4, 3 and 5.

424
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Those were my Pokemon games.

425
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,240
I tried to get into Pokemon Aloha.

426
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
That just...

427
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,240
No, that was not happening.

428
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I think we'll play the...

429
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
How do you call it?

430
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,240
What is this one, isn't it?

431
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Oh yeah.

432
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Oh yeah, Mr. Krabs.

433
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Oh gosh, I forgot.

434
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Was it this one?

435
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
What is this below?

436
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Oh, that caught my memory so good.

437
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Yeah, Sun and Moon was hard.

438
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Yeah, I couldn't finish it.

439
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
You didn't like Gen 7.

440
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
So I played Aloha.

441
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,240
And then...

442
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
I couldn't...

443
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
I just kept...

444
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
I did the first battle and it was like...

445
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,240
You know, the gyms are different in Aloha.

446
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
It was like, you get an onslaught and I'm like,

447
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,240
oh, that's fine, like I can do the onslaught.

448
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,240
The dialogue just kept going and going

449
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,240
and going and going and going.

450
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
I'm like, shut the fuck up.

451
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
I just want to play the game.

452
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I just want to play the fucking game.

453
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
It would not shut up.

454
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
It was like still holding my hand,

455
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
like solid two hours into it.

456
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm like, bro, at least we put Gen 3 in that.

457
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,240
The game like wraps it up.

458
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
It's like, now you're on your own,

459
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,240
you're going to like go defeat your dad in a gym type thing.

460
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Where the heck am I?

461
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Where am I?

462
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
Oh, you mean it wasn't difficult.

463
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
It just would not stop talking.

464
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
Oh, wow.

465
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I put it like here?

466
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
What?

467
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
No.

468
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
Okay.

469
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
Highest checkpoint.

470
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Yeah.

471
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Starting with X and Y,

472
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
they really started to dumb down the game.

473
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
No!

474
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
Wait, what?

475
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
I lost that progress.

476
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,240
I lost that progress because I came here.

477
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
Oh my God, this game is so stinky.

478
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
This game is so stinky.

479
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Yeah.

480
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
I beat Sun and Moon,

481
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
and even after beating the Elite Four,

482
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
there was still dialogue.

483
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
Oh, like literally it was like...

484
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Oh, I'm drowning.

485
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Sorry, sorry.

486
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I'm drowning because I'm complaining about Pokemon.

487
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,240
They're forcing you to take another bath.

488
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
My pheromones.

489
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
Oh, my feet are on screen as well.

490
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
What is this thing there?

491
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
Wait, what?

492
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Is this a secret?

493
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
No, no.

494
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Do not go down there.

495
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,240
That does not look like a secret to me.

496
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,240
Right, let's try this again.

497
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,240
Do you think Mummy would like Papers, Please?

498
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I have fantastic news for you, Reflynn.

499
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Absolutely gorgeous news for you.

500
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,240
I've played 30 minutes of Papers, Please,

501
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
but I never completed it because I sucked at it

502
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
and I raged quite off of it.

503
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,240
So we're going to play it this time again,

504
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
and we'll play it with you,

505
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
and you can get me to the end of the game

506
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
because I suck at those like...

507
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
I've seen...

508
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Is it supposed to be like Hello...

509
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
No, not Hello Neighbor.

510
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,240
It's like Spy...

511
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Your neighbor's not your neighbor game or something.

512
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Papers, Please is kind of like that.

513
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
We're getting all the endings.

514
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
I've not even ended...

515
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
I've not finished it one.

516
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,240
You've got too much faith.

517
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,240
If you like Papers, Please, you might not at the broadcast.

518
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,240
I've been looking into

519
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
how much money I've spent on video games

520
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
since I started streaming,

521
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
and, ooh, Reflynn.

522
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,240
I think I'm going to have to start playing

523
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
a few more Xbox Game Pass games

524
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,240
because, ooh, oh dear, oh dear, Reflynn.

525
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
Oh, that was me.

526
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
I think since debut,

527
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,240
I've spent like $800 on video games.

528
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
Australian dollars, that is.

529
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
Australian dollars, but...

530
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Yeah, I did not realize how much I had been willing...

531
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
Now, don't get me wrong.

532
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
I earned that money back and all that type thing,

533
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,240
and I get a little cheeky, tiny tax back on it.

534
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
But $800 since debut,

535
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I'm like, I'm going to have to start farming them

536
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Xbox games with them free-to-play games

537
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,240
because, ooh, I've been a bit willy-nilly.

538
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,240
A wee bit willy-nilly with my spending, Reflynn.

539
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Hmm.

540
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
You accept gifted games on your throat?

541
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
I did not accept any of them.

542
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I felt really bad.

543
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
I feel... I don't know...

544
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Right, so this is just me and my way of thinking.

545
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,240
And my way of thinking is very wrong, okay?

546
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Probably, I don't know.

547
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
I'm not very smart.

548
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
My...

549
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Like, I don't think you should pay for content

550
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,240
in terms of, like, literally funding my games.

551
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,240
It's not that it's icky or anything like that.

552
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
It's just for me, personally.

553
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
Like, if other streamers do it, fucking knock yourself out.

554
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Like, it's got nothing to do with me.

555
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
That's not my business.

556
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
I couldn't get less of a resource.

557
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,240
But just, I feel a bit weird about the concept of you

558
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,240
buying a game for me to stream and, like, do my thing with.

559
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Alright, I've not been here before.

560
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Hmm.

561
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,240
But I understand the reason why I was getting gifted

562
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,240
on my StreamSnipe account was to play games with you.

563
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,240
I understand that, but, yeah.

564
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
All willy nilly?

565
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Yep.

566
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
All lax today's a call.

567
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
All willy nilly.

568
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
So more Overwatch to save money.

569
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Got it.

570
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
No, no, no, no.

571
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,240
After this week's membership Overwatch playing,

572
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
that's it for Overwatch for quite a hot second.

573
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Where the fuck are they going now?

574
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Up.

575
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Up.

576
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
Yeah, it looks like up.

577
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
How complicated is tax?

578
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
Not very.

579
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
I just go to the accountant.

580
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,240
And I'm like, hey, I want to claim these.

581
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
And then, and then that's it.

582
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,240
I get to pay extra tax because I'm a foreigner, though.

583
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
Yay!

584
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,240
I get to pay extra taxes and not receive the benefits

585
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
of being a citizen.

586
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Yippee!

587
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
That's basically what it's like.

588
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
How nice.

589
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I know!

590
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
So kind.

591
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Thank you, Australian government.

592
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Oh, Australia.

593
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
Oh, Australia.

594
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,240
The land of the prisoners.

595
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,240
I actually don't know the national anthem here.

596
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Me wondering why my visa's in limbo.

597
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,240
And that I might be getting kicked out of the country

598
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
at any second.

599
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
Yippee!

600
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Let's go, government.

601
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Yay!

602
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
That's right.

603
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Tax the fuck out of me.

604
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
Yeah!

605
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
I love you, tax.

606
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Actually, you know what, I will say though,

607
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,240
I prefer to be taxed in Australia than in Scotland

608
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,240
because Australia has much nicer taxes

609
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
if you're a business.

610
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Versus in the UK, the tax...

611
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Oh, who goes there?

612
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
By the Pope.

613
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Mummy, your collapse confused me.

614
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
What, do you so say when I clap with my hands

615
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
is the other thing?

616
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,240
No, that's bad.

617
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,240
Riflin, that's naughty.

618
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,240
That's naughty.

619
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,240
If you are a snowberry,

620
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
I have a fun little update for you

621
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,240
if you're lurking in the shadows.

622
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Your gorgeous little...

623
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
I can't say that.

624
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I was about to say something to us.

625
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Your gorgeous beloved polar bear

626
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
is gonna have a highlight video

627
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,240
coming out soon of Super Subducer.

628
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
So that's one highlight on Mercy,

629
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
one on AC,

630
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,240
and then next on the agenda

631
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
is Sheebie's getting a highlight reel.

632
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,240
And there's gonna be more shorts coming soon to you.

633
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
So soon to you.

634
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Oh, I forgot about the angel wings.

635
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
I've not been collecting them.

636
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
I probably could have done it

637
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
if I was smart enough, but...

638
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
Where am I to go over there?

639
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Um...

640
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Yes, it is a fun little highlight video

641
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
of one of our Subducer gameplays,

642
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,240
and she goes,

643
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
I love True Gentleman.

644
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Sorry, I know it's your meme,

645
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
and I shouldn't impede on your...

646
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
Where am I?

647
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Over there.

648
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,240
I shouldn't impede on your memes, snowberries,

649
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
but I'm so sorry.

650
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
I fucking love True Gentleman.

651
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
I'm gonna get it as a sand board.

652
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
I don't care.

653
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
I'm getting it as a sand board, okay?

654
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
I love it.

655
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
True Gentleman.

656
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,240
But what will you do with them?

657
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Not like you can reattach them.

658
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Oh, wait, what did I say?

659
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Did you see the highlight with Azura and Mercy?

660
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
It was so cute.

661
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Oh, no, I'm not seeing it yet.

662
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
That's what I'm saying.

663
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Like, if you want to ask me,

664
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,240
like, oh, how do you like being a streamer,

665
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
a VTuber, however,

666
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
I absolutely adore it,

667
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
but it's like, what's the downside?

668
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
It's like, I literally cannot keep up

669
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
with my gen mates,

670
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
and it pains me so much.

671
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Angel, I would get the Angel Wing,

672
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
but it's literally,

673
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
I've not been collecting the other ones,

674
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,240
so Ripperoni, Pepperoni,

675
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
there's no point.

676
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
And I'm pretty sure the Angel Wing

677
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,240
is to like get things, is it not?

678
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Oh, spicy.

679
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,240
Oh my God, I'm hardly even near the end.

680
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Jeez.

681
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I honestly thought the developer,

682
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,240
right, not in a rude way.

683
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
If I let me see my sense,

684
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
not in a rude way,

685
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
I thought this game was a bit more

686
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,240
of a cash grab than I originally thought.

687
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
But no, the dev gen-

688
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Oh, who goes there?

689
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,240
The developer genuinely put

690
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
like a lot into this.

691
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
I don't know if it was a solo developer

692
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
or a small team,

693
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
but no,

694
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
my impressions of this game were wrong,

695
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
and I admit it, I'm wrong.

696
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
I apologize to the dev team.

697
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
I thought this was a bit more of a cash grab

698
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
than I originally thought.

699
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Jeez, why am I struggling with that?

700
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
True gentleman, I've ruined that friendship

701
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
living your head.

702
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Oh no, I don't know,

703
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
but I've ruined your friendship.

704
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Was that in the highlight?

705
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
After one year streaming every day,

706
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
will you start to take breaks?

707
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I don't have an answer yet for you,

708
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
my dear refling.

709
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,240
The reason is,

710
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,240
I don't know what the future holds,

711
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,240
so if I can get away with it,

712
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,240
and things still continue as they do,

713
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
I mean, as far as I'm aware,

714
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,240
the girls aren't disgruntled about,

715
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,240
you know, me taking a few days

716
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
to do stuff when they ask for it.

717
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
They ask for breaks,

718
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
I have like scripts in that,

719
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
they've been kind of waiting

720
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
on like a few scripts and whatnot.

721
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
What does that button mean?

722
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Oh, like as far as I'm aware,

723
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
everyone's alright.

724
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,240
If they want advice, they are,

725
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
oh wait, what?

726
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Did the game just rebate me?

727
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
No.

728
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
So when Gen 2 come along,

729
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,240
obviously I'll have them for two months

730
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
under my,

731
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
under my,

732
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
the pre-DBU stage,

733
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,240
and depending on what girls we get,

734
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,240
if we get girls that are either hidden gems

735
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
or maybe more established,

736
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,240
I don't know what the dealio is going to be

737
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
under your angel wing, yes.

738
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
But like for example,

739
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
say if we got people that were like

740
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
ex-agency members,

741
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
they've done this rodeo before,

742
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
they want a fresh start

743
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
and they want to join Veealer.

744
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Well, most likely all things point

745
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
to that girl's not going to need anything from me,

746
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,240
other than maybe an ASMR script if she wants it.

747
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Like she doesn't need me to analyse her content,

748
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
she doesn't need me to say like,

749
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
oh, you should,

750
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,240
you know, this stream is most likely going to get you popular

751
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
or da-da-da-da.

752
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,240
She's been there, done that.

753
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
She doesn't need me, you know what I mean?

754
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Whereas if we get like people that,

755
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,240
I believe are hidden gems,

756
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
but that might need a bit more polishing,

757
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
that kind of terminology,

758
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
then, yeah.

759
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
I don't know what the answer is.

760
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,240
I would very much like to continue

761
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
to stream every day.

762
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Whether or not that would mean

763
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,240
I might peel back on,

764
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
say for example,

765
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,240
like the fucking mega long streams

766
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
are kind of what killed me the most.

767
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Feet pics equal followers trust.

768
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Where did that come from?

769
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Is that me giving advice to Jen too?

770
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Oh, but just post your feet, by the way.

771
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
It's real.

772
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Wait, am I to cross the train?

773
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,240
I'm to cross the trains?

774
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Oh, I'm not sure that one.

775
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,240
I mean, we did end up posting our wee feet.

776
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Oh, what on earth?

777
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,240
I'm literally playing frog with the train station.

778
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Oh, come on.

779
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
Right, hold on.

780
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Let us observe the train schedule.

781
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,240
One, two, three, and then four.

782
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Oh, so it's literally just a line.

783
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
Okay, well, when you put it like that,

784
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,240
that was so simple.

785
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Post feet, insta subs, honestly, though.

786
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Honestly, honestly.

787
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,240
But yeah, if we get independent creators,

788
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I honestly don't really see why I would need to ease up.

789
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
If anything, I could probably go a bit more balls to the wall

790
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
with my project.

791
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
I'm gonna go on top.

792
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,240
I don't trust going inside the carriage.

793
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Hook and followers are feet.

794
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,240
Keep them loyal with poctin.

795
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Keep them ready to plait me for gen three.

796
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Right, we're going in an elevator.

797
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Peeler is the way to cross, real.

798
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
Me messaging Azura like,

799
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,240
hey, when you got that audio for me, baby girl.

800
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Honey, yeah.

801
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Keep my pee hair, you know what I'm saying?

802
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,240
But yes, today I am going offline bang.

803
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
I'm not gonna yap.

804
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
I'm not gonna overstay my welcome.

805
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm gonna redirect into sheepsters, all that jazz.

806
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,240
Obviously, with the recent, I've got things to do,

807
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,240
but I also have things to do for you, Reefling,

808
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,240
so you guys have content because we're now entered

809
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,240
the fourth month of streaming.

810
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,240
To put it nicely, I'm not mad at myself.

811
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I'm just disappointed for the lack of content

812
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
that I have given you.

813
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
I am a bit about it.

814
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Feet pics when duck cream brulee, Reefling sir.

815
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Thank you for your cherry.

816
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,240
I have fantastic news for you.

817
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,240
If you go on my channel and you click on oldest live streams

818
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,240
and you see monetization celebration,

819
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,240
click that live stream for no particular reason.

820
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,240
You're gonna have a fucking field day with that stream, sir.

821
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Thank you.

822
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,240
I already got you covered, okay?

823
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
I already got you covered.

824
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
Lack of content.

825
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Your daily streams and several member streams for a week.

826
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,240
Stop slacking with a lack of content.

827
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,240
I just, what I'm annoyed about is I want to be

828
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
much further with milestones.

829
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,240
I already want to be at the stage where I am...

830
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:50,240
I've already up to date with my milestones.

831
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,240
I am now fully writing milestone content

832
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,240
that you, Reeflings, want to see.

833
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,240
God, we're in the city now.

834
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,240
Oh my gosh, there's supermarket simulator down there.

835
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Right, that's the Reboot-Op supermarket simulator.

836
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
I really find those games satisfying.

837
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
I don't know why, but...

838
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Well, this is a rather satisfying game, so...

839
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
Lack of content, you put it somewhere.

840
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,240
I just like the collabs as well.

841
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
Poor Poseidon.

842
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
Yumi's been waiting on the collab as well.

843
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Literally, I can do Yumi's one right now.

844
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Poseidon, I need a very specific sound effect.

845
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,240
And I don't want to stress out my gen mate,

846
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,240
but only she can do it because my fucking thing failed.

847
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,240
I don't have a wooden bowl.

848
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
And...

849
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,240
I feel really bad about making everyone wait for the collabs.

850
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
And I need to arrange...

851
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Why am I fucking this up so much?

852
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,240
And I need to arrange more as well.

853
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Stroney Yarns for the Weegee Life.

854
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,240
I mean, I'm going back into education.

855
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Unironically, I'm going to beauty school.

856
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,240
So I can learn to do ASMR and facials and stuff.

857
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Because I'd really like it.

858
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
Brian!

859
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,240
And why are the notifications so delayed today?

860
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
Stream element's feeling alright.

861
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
She's going up the ventilation shaft.

862
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
I hold on to the crane.

863
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
I see her.

864
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
Aloha.

865
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
I'm letting you cook.

866
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
Thank you.

867
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,240
Yumi, I can do your collab ASAP once...

868
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,240
I get...

869
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,240
a moment to think.

870
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Give me a moment to...

871
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
Can you hold on?

872
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,240
Thank you.

873
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,240
You're going to give me some sweet lack of content.

874
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
Really lack of content.

875
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,240
I can consume in my spare time, honestly.

876
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,240
I just like being there.

877
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,240
I like the...

878
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
Sorry.

879
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
I don't know what that noise was either.

880
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,240
It sounded like I had a kazoo on the end of my throat.

881
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
Lower accurate facials.

882
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
This is crazy.

883
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,240
I'm really passionate about ASMR.

884
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,240
I want to do beauty school for it.

885
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,240
I've been looking around

886
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,240
if there's like a six week course near me.

887
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
But unfortunately there's not.

888
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,240
So I can't do it until I pop off.

889
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
I really am passionate about ASMR.

890
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
As much as folk want to...

891
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
As much as folk want to be like,

892
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
Oh, ASMR's a cash grab.

893
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,240
This is that.

894
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
What? No!

895
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
You didn't save my last location?

896
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,240
This is so far back.

897
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,240
It's like an ocean noise.

898
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Really passionate about facials, huh?

899
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
I need a throat show.

900
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
Because of how rubbish my voice is right now.

901
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
It's so broken.

902
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,240
So, so broken right now.

903
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,240
But yeah, I want to get more collabs out of the way.

904
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,240
I'm entering my fourth month

905
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,240
and my little goal of a hundred VTuber collabs

906
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,240
is not happening if I don't light a fire under my ass.

907
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,240
But I've made contact with them

908
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,240
another agency to...

909
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,240
No!

910
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,240
Don't make me do it again.

911
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,240
I'm going to be angry.

912
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,240
No, I'm angry.

913
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
I'm angry.

914
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,240
No.

915
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,240
People think ASMR's a cash grab.

916
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,240
I think people see ASMR's like low quality content

917
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
because it's like...

918
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
It's like...

919
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
It's like...

920
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
It's like...

921
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
And it's like, no, that's your fucking perception.

922
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Like, damn right, I'm going to sit in my ASMR booth

923
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
and tap on shit for 30 seconds and whisper...

924
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,240
30 seconds, 30 minutes and get distracted about LMNOP.

925
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
You will get there.

926
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
Don't rush yourself.

927
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
I want to already...

928
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
I don't know if you remember,

929
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
I did a community post ages ago

930
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,240
that was like tell me what trigger words you want me to say.

931
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
I haven't recorded that yet

932
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
but like after this stream,

933
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
I am completely ignoring all the girls

934
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
which I feel really bad about.

935
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
So what I call it is me being selfish.

936
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,240
That's how I describe it.

937
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,240
When I finish stream and do work for myself,

938
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,240
I call it me being selfish

939
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
which is terrible because it's not.

940
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,240
It's just me being doing content, you know?

941
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,240
But like today is all about me.

942
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,240
I'm putting together Shibi's proposal for her donathon.

943
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,240
I'm sending away her donathon trailer

944
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,240
and then it's all me.

945
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Everything I do for the rest of the day is all me

946
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,240
and I call it being selfish.

947
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,240
When it's not, it's just fucking making content.

948
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,240
It's only selfish by not neglecting the reason.

949
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,240
But that's what...

950
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
It's not that it annoys me.

951
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,240
I suppose the better word would be like

952
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
I wish I could do more.

953
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,240
I wish I had more energy.

954
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,240
I wish I could do this.

955
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
I love Emmy shorts

956
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,240
and I've wrote scripts for four ASMR shorts

957
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,240
being like talking about the microphone quality,

958
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,240
talking about how much do they make,

959
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
like I was going to show my income,

960
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
I was going to show the...

961
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,240
What the fuck?

962
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,240
That seems rather dangerous, don't you think?

963
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
I'm not going to drive that.

964
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,240
Oh, I need to drive it to get past, okay.

965
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,240
Mummy has earned the right to be selfish.

966
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,240
Yeah, so it means tomorrow when I put up

967
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,240
a stream with Sheevee for the stream snapping.

968
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Oh my God, it's a tight fit.

969
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,240
Oh yeah, right now.

970
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Beep, beep.

971
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,240
X.

972
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,240
Oh my God, I'm so good at this job.

973
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,240
I'm such a multitasker.

974
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,240
Not only do I...

975
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,240
There's a little platform here.

976
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
Are you forklift certified?

977
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,240
Ladies love me, I'm forklift certified now.

978
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,240
You're familiar with tight fits, aren't you?

979
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
Right, right, right.

980
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
Hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

981
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,240
But yeah, I'm going to get a bath,

982
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,240
I'm going to shave,

983
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,240
I'm going to take my little foes with my collar,

984
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,240
or your collar, our collars together.

985
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,240
I've also have a picture of my hands

986
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,240
holding a ruler with my nails

987
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,240
to put on the alternative Twitter.

988
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Like, I'm trying.

989
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
I know things take long.

990
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,240
Wow, that was actually really lucky.

991
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,240
Poopy time.

992
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,240
I think it's over.

993
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,240
Someone call Oshia, this stuff don't look safe.

994
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
No, I don't think it looks safe either.

995
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,240
I like the graffiti detail.

996
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
N.

997
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
I.

998
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
I.

999
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,240
Wa...

1000
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,240
Wait, is that Russian?

1001
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,240
Weird.

1002
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,240
I need to look into the developer.

1003
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,240
There is a new developer game that I...

1004
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Oh god, it's a maze.

1005
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,240
Purple or yellow?

1006
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,240
Yellow on the outskirts of the maze?

1007
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,240
And then this one?

1008
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
Blue?

1009
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
What?

1010
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,240
Okay, get wrecked.

1011
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,240
Sorry, but that was too obvious.

1012
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
So was you too obvious.

1013
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
Our collar.

1014
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,240
Russia intensified.

1015
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
Wait, when does it spin?

1016
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
I don't know.

1017
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,240
One, two, three, four, five.

1018
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,240
Okay, it spins on five.

1019
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,240
It spins on five.

1020
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,240
She's gaming.

1021
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
Oh, you never showed the cover, I guess.

1022
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
Oh, I didn't show it.

1023
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,240
No, I showed your collar on yesterday's hand cam stream.

1024
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,240
I showed your dog bowl as well.

1025
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,240
It looks so cute.

1026
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,240
I'mma fill it up with kibble for you.

1027
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,240
No, I wouldn't make you eat dog food.

1028
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,240
I'm sorry.

1029
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,240
That's not for me.

1030
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,240
Some people are like really into it.

1031
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,240
That's where I draw the line.

1032
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,240
I'm like, hold on a minute.

1033
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,240
Now, someone who ate cat food.

1034
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,240
My fellow Americans.

1035
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,240
Someone who ate cat food.

1036
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,240
By accident, I was a child.

1037
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
And by accident, I was an adult.

1038
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,240
It was very recent.

1039
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,240
I will not.

1040
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,240
I'm not into like actually making me busy.

1041
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,240
That stuff.

1042
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,240
I put cereal in it.

1043
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Do you want frosted treadies?

1044
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,240
It's the best.

1045
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,240
I love frosted treadies.

1046
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,240
I used to eat the absolute out of them.

1047
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,240
And they were so, it didn't even matter if they were soggy.

1048
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,240
They're just delicious.

1049
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,240
They were so delicious.

1050
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,240
That's it.

1051
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,240
I'm important frost.

1052
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,240
I'm importing frosted treadies right the fuck now.

1053
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,240
Right the fuck now.

1054
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,240
I'm doing a treadies cereal tier list.

1055
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,240
There you are.

1056
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,240
Mm-hmm.

1057
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,240
Happy little accent.

1058
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,240
You ate cat food thinking you'd become.

1059
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,240
Right.

1060
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,240
Like some other visevers.

1061
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,240
I don't know.

1062
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,240
I can't imagine myself not being a cutlerfish.

1063
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
I can imagine myself like dressing up

1064
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,240
to be another different kind of

1065
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
VTuber.

1066
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,240
But like as I said,

1067
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,240
oh when it comes to me,

1068
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,240
no, no, don't register that as my highest point.

1069
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
Oh thank goodness.

1070
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,240
The quality control in cat and dog food is terrible.

1071
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,240
It is.

1072
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,240
100%.

1073
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,240
Like I was wanting to make homemade meals for my pooders.

1074
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
But,

1075
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,240
I don't even have time to make food for myself.

1076
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,240
Big jump.

1077
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,240
It's balls.

1078
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,240
We're

1079
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,240
here,

1080
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,240
and then

1081
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
here,

1082
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,240
and then

1083
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,240
here,

1084
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,240
and then we squeeze past.

1085
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,240
Race Krispies.

1086
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,240
Oh no.

1087
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,240
I'm sorry,

1088
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,240
your miracle abs cancelled.

1089
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,240
I'm afraid that's not an acceptable answer.

1090
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
Honey Cheerios.

1091
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Crunchy Nut as well.

1092
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,240
Don't laugh.

1093
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,240
That's the name of the cereal brand.

1094
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
It's called Crunchy Nut.

1095
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,240
What is this?

1096
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,240
What?

1097
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,240
Am I supposed to do a U-turn around this building?

1098
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,240
Wait, no, sorry.

1099
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,240
I must be missing the thing here.

1100
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
Rep you meme.

1101
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,240
Am I supposed to jump on the crane?

1102
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,240
No.

1103
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,240
No, there's something...

1104
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Crunchy Nut when the reflins are...

1105
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
Oh!

1106
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,240
Oh, fucking sick.

1107
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,240
Okay.

1108
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,240
It is.

1109
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,240
It's called Crunchy Nut.

1110
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,240
Don't laugh.

1111
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,240
It's some really good cereal as well.

1112
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,240
I really like honey.

1113
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,240
I've always enjoyed honey severely.

1114
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,240
It just is very nice.

1115
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,240
The sweetness is...

1116
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,240
What the fuck is that?

1117
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,240
I failed the visual novel dating simulation

1118
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,240
interaction was scrawny.

1119
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,240
Real.

1120
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
Real.

1121
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,240
But yeah, I was wanting...

1122
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,240
Oh, that's where I was getting at before I got distracted

1123
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,240
as I always do because I can't strike a sentence together

1124
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,240
for the life of me.

1125
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,240
I...

1126
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,240
I'm doing shorts about Ace Marne.

1127
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,240
I was going to show income and different analytics and stuff.

1128
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,240
But because I have so little freaking content,

1129
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,240
it's really hard to pull off the shorts that I want to do

1130
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,240
right at this very second.

1131
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,240
And I want to start doing content

1132
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,240
that you guys ask for.

1133
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,240
And I want to record

1134
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,240
an audio role-play version of the hypnosis streams

1135
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,240
and just doing all of this.

1136
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
But I keep getting distracted.

1137
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,240
Obviously, I woke up today and I was like,

1138
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,240
right, I'm going to get so much done.

1139
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,240
And then Poo Wee Immerses account

1140
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,240
gets a wee bit of a...

1141
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
It gets put on a post-champ and I'm like,

1142
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,240
okay, a little bit of a distraction.

1143
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,240
But that's basically what happens.

1144
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,240
Something new will pop up and I'm like,

1145
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,240
oh, I didn't expect that I was going to have to do that.

1146
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,240
What the fuck?

1147
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,240
What?

1148
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,240
Are we getting magnetized over there?

1149
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
I think so.

1150
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,240
So I'm just going to say pulling off shorts, exactly.

1151
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,240
Great idea.

1152
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,240
Veal or Dayton Simulator.

1153
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
I did talk to the girls about that

1154
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,240
because it can be easily done

1155
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,240
and it's a hell of a lot cheaper than what the fuck I paid for.

1156
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,240
But the video game's getting wrapped up

1157
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,240
and it can finally be shipped.

1158
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,240
Unfortunately, I am rather...

1159
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
Disappoint...

1160
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
Have I got metal in my head?

1161
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,240
Wait, oh, I'm to hold on to the metal?

1162
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,240
No, what?

1163
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Have I got metal in my head?

1164
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
Please be real.

1165
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,240
I'm really disappointed in myself

1166
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,240
when it comes to the video game.

1167
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,240
Obviously, round two will be a lot better,

1168
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,240
but I'm not very pleased,

1169
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,240
especially with the money I spent on it.

1170
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,240
But hey, that is life.

1171
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,240
Look, everything's...

1172
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,240
You can learn from the past.

1173
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,240
Don't dwell on it.

1174
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,240
Don't get annoyed at yourself.

1175
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
I'm getting the plat trophy in the game.

1176
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,240
More like you're getting the plat trophy in the game.

1177
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,240
Thank you.

1178
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
Got another tenor shift.

1179
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,240
Do you need a lock-in for the tenor shift?

1180
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,240
I'm so sorry.

1181
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,240
Please hydrate.

1182
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,240
Hold on, she went over the buildings.

1183
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,240
What's over the buildings?

1184
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,240
Oh my gosh, it's Bioshock Infinite.

1185
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,240
Bioshock Infinite.

1186
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,240
Wait, what?

1187
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,240
Is that really what I'm supposed to do?

1188
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,240
You're here all night, huh?

1189
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,240
Why are you so cool?

1190
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,240
Am I really supposed to...

1191
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,240
Hold on, let me lock in gamers.

1192
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,240
Mommy's locking in.

1193
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,240
Oh, I didn't realize it was pushing me forward.

1194
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,240
Sorry, hold on, let me lock in.

1195
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,240
Serious face on, serious face.

1196
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,240
You know what?

1197
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240
Right, hold on a minute.

1198
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,240
I'll let you...

1199
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,240
You know what?

1200
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,240
In...

1201
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,240
Right, no, breathe.

1202
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,240
Okay, hold on.

1203
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,240
See, all you have to do is breathe through video games, honestly.

1204
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,240
I don't know what the problem is.

1205
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,240
All you gotta do is breathe through.

1206
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,240
You should do a free keyboard giveaway.

1207
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,240
I doubt that nobody would want to salate over the keys.

1208
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,240
I'm actually, for one of my Donathon rewards,

1209
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,240
I am doing an ASMR video of me cleaning my gamer keyboard.

1210
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,240
It's gonna be fucking vile.

1211
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,240
I also have a mouse mat that is gonna get washed

1212
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,240
for in the video as well.

1213
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,240
It's like three years of accumulation.

1214
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,240
Maybe even more, actually.

1215
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,240
Most likely more.

1216
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,240
But I was gonna do...

1217
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,240
Oh, it goes...

1218
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,240
Oh, I got...

1219
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,240
Oh, I'm getting pushed.

1220
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,240
Oh, my God, don't push me.

1221
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,240
It's gonna be a Donathon reward.

1222
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,240
I can thankfully prepare a lot

1223
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,240
for my Donathon fun stuff that I'm doing.

1224
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,240
It is absolutely vile.

1225
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:11,240
The amount of food, dust, dead skin, cat hair,

1226
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,240
my hair, it's pretty...

1227
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,240
Oh, no, wait.

1228
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,240
I could have picked up the other one.

1229
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,240
It counts, like, on over all your files.

1230
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,240
I didn't know that.

1231
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
I feel dumb now that I walked past it.

1232
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,240
Under those keys has to be absolutely putrid, honestly.

1233
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,240
Mingen putrid.

1234
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,240
Disgustan! Disgustan!

1235
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,240
Which one do you use?

1236
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,240
I went for a shite and didney flush.

1237
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,240
Well, it's fucking one of yours!

1238
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
Disgustan!

1239
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,240
Yeah, that's basically...

1240
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,240
Fuck it!

1241
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,240
Right, no.

1242
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,240
Do the timer again.

1243
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,240
I hate when video games do that.

1244
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,240
Surprise timer, but cat hair.

1245
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,240
Time to call and kill me.

1246
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
Autistic girlfriend builds Legos Wind.

1247
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
Do you actually want that?

1248
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,240
Because I will happily make that.

1249
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,240
You'll never guess what.

1250
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,240
I have the perfect.

1251
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,240
I have the perfect.

1252
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,240
Let me write it down.

1253
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,240
Yeah, that's another thing.

1254
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,240
Like, I want to do all these fun ideas we came up together.

1255
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,240
I hear music.

1256
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,240
I heard that.

1257
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,240
Whose music was that?

1258
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,240
Was it this?

1259
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,240
Oh, it's this.

1260
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,240
Okay, hold on.

1261
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,240
Analizing, analyzing, analyzing, analyzing, analyzing.

1262
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,240
Analizing, analyzing, analyzing.

1263
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,240
And we've analyzed.

1264
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,240
Who wouldn't want such a glorious anal smirk?

1265
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,240
What can I say?

1266
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,240
I'm just a signal.

1267
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,240
What can I say?

1268
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,240
Except you're welcome.

1269
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,240
Wait, you could go different ways?

1270
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,240
Have I gone the wrong way?

1271
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
No.

1272
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,240
Something is bumping the tunes.

1273
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,240
I better not be copyrighted.

1274
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,240
How many do you have on that list?

1275
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,240
I have so much.

1276
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,240
Like, that's what I'm saying.

1277
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,240
Like, when it's selfish.

1278
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,240
So tomorrow I'm going to wake up at midnight to record

1279
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,240
because I'm probably going to write ASMR scripts and stuff.

1280
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,240
But I'm wanting to wrap up a lot of my collabs.

1281
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,240
So once Yumi and Poseidon are done, I'm like 99% sure

1282
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,240
that's all the collab lines I have.

1283
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,240
So I'm going to go pester my collab partners that agreed

1284
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,240
because I think, I think I have like,

1285
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,240
Twi-whoa!

1286
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,240
Oh my God, is this invisible?

1287
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,240
That is...

1288
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
Can my brain do this?

1289
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Right, okay, hold on, hold on.

1290
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,240
My brain can't do that.

1291
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,240
Selfish, more like selfish stuff.

1292
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
I will.

1293
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,240
Right, hold on.

1294
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Let me, you know, I...

1295
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:06,240
North, west, north, west, north, east, south, east.

1296
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,240
Hold on.

1297
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,240
Whoa, tree.

1298
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,240
Hee-hee.

1299
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,240
Hee-hee, helping with the Michael Jackson.

1300
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,240
Wait, what?

1301
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,240
Oh no, I don't remember this part.

1302
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,240
Is it before or after?

1303
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,240
I must...

1304
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,240
Poseidon is before you!

1305
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,240
Oh, it's on!

1306
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,240
Okay, right, hold on.

1307
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,240
Oh, I forgot, that did that so well.

1308
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,240
Right, it's before that last rock.

1309
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,240
Okay, let's try that again.

1310
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,240
Right, you know what?

1311
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,240
I want your collab, Obama.

1312
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,240
What?

1313
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,240
I've already forgotten.

1314
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:18,240
Right, open it up again, one more time.

1315
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,240
Forward, left, right, okay.

1316
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,240
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

1317
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,240
Right, and then up, and then line up the tree.

1318
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,240
And go a little to the right, and then go a little to the right,

1319
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,240
and then go forward, and then go up,

1320
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,240
and then before the tree, take a little left,

1321
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,240
and then look forward.

1322
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,240
Okay, I'm done.

1323
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,240
Okay, let's go!

1324
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,240
Oh boy, follow me.

1325
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,240
The Obama, I'm afraid, sorry.

1326
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:53,240
We follow idol culture, aren't we, Laura?

1327
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,240
We do not interact with males, okay.

1328
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,240
I don't even know my own dad.

1329
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,240
He wasn't even there for my conception.

1330
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,240
He wasn't even there for, yeah, no.

1331
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,240
I don't even know what dad is.

1332
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,240
Shame, shame truly.

1333
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,240
Uh, right, what are you?

1334
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,240
Whoa!

1335
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,240
Oh, I get it.

1336
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,240
Oh, this is cute.

1337
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,240
I like whatever this is.

1338
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,240
Whoa, it's like throwing me forward, please don't do that.

1339
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
No scrawny dad.

1340
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,240
Tragic, truly.

1341
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,240
It is, it is tragic.

1342
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,240
Okay, if I go too fast,

1343
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,240
the, like, momentum makes me fall.

1344
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,240
So let's...

1345
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,240
Careful.

1346
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,240
Dad, yeah, my dad went out to get some milk, sorry.

1347
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,240
I'm sorry, you have to learn this way.

1348
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,240
I'm sorry, you have to learn this way.

1349
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,240
It's Johnny's dad watching the stream right now,

1350
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,240
like, I spoke to him,

1351
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,240
and he says I look a lot better recently,

1352
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,240
and I'm like, yeah, things are resolving.

1353
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,240
I got, like, a manager,

1354
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,240
and I'm like, okay, I'm done,

1355
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,240
I'm done, I'm done.

1356
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,240
Yeah, things are resolving.

1357
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,240
I got, like, a manager and stuff,

1358
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,240
and I'm getting another one.

1359
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,240
And he was like, oh, that's good, Johnny.

1360
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,240
No, because he was, like,

1361
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,240
every time I see you,

1362
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,240
you look like shit,

1363
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,240
and I'm like, thanks, dad.

1364
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,240
But he'll see how it is,

1365
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,240
but we spoke very briefly yesterday,

1366
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,240
and he was like, oh, you look better,

1367
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,240
and I'm like, I know.

1368
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,240
Also, do you want to know

1369
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,240
a fun fact about my magpie?

1370
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,240
It does tricks!

1371
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,240
Um, I am very close

1372
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,240
to holding a magpie.

1373
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,240
That's all I'm saying.

1374
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,240
Oh, how did I manage that again?

1375
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,240
Johnny's dad, if you're watching this,

1376
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,240
and you're raised an excellent living being.

1377
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,240
I did be breathing and stuff.

1378
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,240
So, my magpie,

1379
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,240
it's the male magpie.

1380
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,240
Oh, my God, male.

1381
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,240
He can catch cashews in the air,

1382
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,240
so I throw them up in the air,

1383
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,240
and he catches them.

1384
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,240
He doesn't want me to put them on the ground.

1385
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,240
He likes the fun of

1386
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,240
swooping together.

1387
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,240
So, magpies can play,

1388
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,240
just so you know.

1389
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,240
So, I am very close

1390
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,240
to hand feeding him, like, so close.

1391
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,240
But this magpie is so trusting,

1392
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,240
I genuinely think I can hold him.

1393
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,240
And that'll be the first time I've ever held

1394
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,240
a wild magpie.

1395
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,240
Like, I'm gonna freaking go mental.

1396
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,240
Hmm, talking about male on stream,

1397
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,240
I know my fucking magpie.

1398
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,240
The magpie I feed, I can't believe it.

1399
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,240
I'm really ahead, do you know the difference

1400
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
between a male and a female magpie?

1401
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,240
I will educate you, little reflin'.

1402
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,240
Thank you for your interest in magpies.

1403
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,240
So, a male magpie has a white

1404
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,240
back of his head,

1405
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,240
and a female magpie has

1406
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,240
mixed, it can be like a gray,

1407
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,240
but males are always

1408
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,240
stark white on the back of the head.

1409
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,240
Like, you cannot...

1410
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,240
Am I fucking lost?

1411
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,240
Hello? Is the manager on site?

1412
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,240
Where am I...

1413
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,240
What am I doing?

1414
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,240
Oh.

1415
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,240
Oh dear.

1416
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,240
Oh dear, oh dear.

1417
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,240
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

1418
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,240
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

1419
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,240
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

1420
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,240
Eh...

1421
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
How's Gammy?

1422
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,240
I'll need to go visit her.

1423
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,240
Um...

1424
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,240
So, magpies remember for a very long time.

1425
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,240
So, I think as soon as she takes

1426
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,240
a bite of a cashew, she'll be like,

1427
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,240
oh, I know you, I'll be like, what?

1428
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,240
No! A logic puzzle?

1429
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
Now, hold on, I didn't say not for a logic puzzle.

1430
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,240
Ah!

1431
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:58,240
Oh well, there goes the stream.

1432
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:02,240
Like that?

1433
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,240
Uh...

1434
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,240
No, that can't be.

1435
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,240
That's completely wrong.

1436
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,240
Look at the bomb piece.

1437
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,240
Uh, wrap it up, you're done.

1438
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,240
Yeah, I'm...

1439
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,240
I feel like that too,

1440
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,240
in all honesty.

1441
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,240
What the fuck?

1442
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,240
How?

1443
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,240
Like this?

1444
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,240
Type of play supermarket simulator?

1445
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,240
Real though?

1446
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,240
Cause what the fuck?

1447
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,240
Okay, that looks a bit better.

1448
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,240
Is it even touching?

1449
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,240
Okay, that, right, the red is correct.

1450
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,240
That's the good news.

1451
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Cause the red goes straight on.

1452
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,240
So, at least the red has a fucking hint.

1453
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,240
Oh no.

1454
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,240
You never frickin warned me this was a logical game?

1455
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,240
Can you cheese it?

1456
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,240
How do I get up to the yellow?

1457
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,240
Whoa, no, you can't cheese that, apparently.

1458
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,240
How do I get up to the yellow from the green?

1459
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,240
Oh, there's a staircase.

1460
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,240
And then the yellow must be a little bit wrong.

1461
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,240
Cause, like, the yellow and green are fucked.

1462
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,240
What?

1463
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:42,240
No, what?

1464
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,240
I need to be able to get the ladder at the top though.

1465
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,240
Hello?

1466
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,240
Hello?

1467
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,240
What?

1468
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,240
No, I, what?

1469
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,240
I need to touch, right, I need to be able to grab that ladder.

1470
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,240
So it has to be this way.

1471
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:03,240
So what is the green wrong even though I managed to jump on it?

1472
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,240
Is that in theory we're doing wrong?

1473
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:16,240
I need it to be, like, near to grab.

1474
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,240
Oh!

1475
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,240
Oh!

1476
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,240
Hold on, hold on, don't write me out just yet.

1477
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,240
Don't write me out.

1478
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,240
Hold on, don't put up supermarket simulator yet.

1479
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,240
Don't write me out yet.

1480
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,240
You look flabbergasted?

1481
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,240
That's because I am.

1482
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,240
I don't, I don't do logic games.

1483
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,240
I don't do logic things.

1484
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,240
I can't, I can't see.

1485
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,240
If you ask me to visualize something in my head,

1486
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,240
you're getting a smudge of a thumbprint, okay?

1487
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,240
You're getting a smudge of a thumbprint.

1488
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,240
I think...

1489
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,240
No way we did that.

1490
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,240
100 IQ.

1491
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,240
100 IQ.

1492
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,240
Right, get up the stairs.

1493
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:04,240
Holy moly, holy moly.

1494
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,240
Developers saw you were doing...

1495
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,240
Whoa!

1496
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,240
Oh, it was impenetra-

1497
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,240
I wasn't paying attention, I was reading chat.

1498
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,240
Right, okay, no, it's fine.

1499
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,240
It's fine, sorry.

1500
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,240
I never even, like, I heard the sound of fight,

1501
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,240
but I was like, oh, that must be for a later thing.

1502
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,240
Sorry, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1503
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,240
Ow, down, ow, down.

1504
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,240
Room temperature IQ, hold on.

1505
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,240
And...

1506
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,240
All right.

1507
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,240
Okay, everyone, close steam.

1508
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,240
You don't need to build up supermarket simulator

1509
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,240
so you can stream snipe me on it.

1510
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,240
Uh...

1511
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,240
What?

1512
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,240
What?

1513
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,240
What's going on here?

1514
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,240
What is going on here?

1515
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
What's going on right?

1516
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,240
Let's analyze this.

1517
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,240
Let's analyze.

1518
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,240
Look at me get eyeballs.

1519
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,240
Right, up you go, up you go.

1520
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,240
Okay.

1521
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,240
I have below freezing IQ.

1522
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,240
That's so cute.

1523
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,240
40 below.

1524
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,240
I love how much you say holy mo-

1525
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:05,240
It's because it's an earworm, it's like,

1526
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,240
and you have to do it with a vocal fryer.

1527
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,240
It's not real.

1528
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,240
It's not real, it's not true.

1529
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:14,240
I might be smarter than a cuttlefish.

1530
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,240
Cuttlefish are cephalopods though.

1531
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,240
They're super smart.

1532
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,240
Like, I know octopus are super smart

1533
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,240
or like trying to be like,

1534
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,240
uh, maybe let's not be mean to this creature.

1535
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,240
It's a bit too high IQ.

1536
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,240
And they say like dolphins are really smart as well.

1537
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,240
I mean, they say dolphins are smart

1538
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,240
and they also are word things,

1539
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,240
so I don't know what that means for us.

1540
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,240
There's definitely something we can extrapolate

1541
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,240
extrapolate from that, can't we?

1542
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,240
We fling.

1543
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,240
Right, let's enjoy the swinging balls.

1544
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,240
Oh!

1545
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,240
Just the name Lia.

1546
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,240
Dolphins are smart but mean.

1547
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,240
Yeah.

1548
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,240
Intelligence is evil.

1549
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,240
A dolphin girl for Jen too.

1550
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,240
Oh!

1551
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,240
And that'll be her shtick,

1552
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,240
she's just an R-worder.

1553
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,240
That's terrible.

1554
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,240
That's actually genuinely terrible.

1555
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
Who said that?

1556
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,240
You can't be saying this stuff out loud.

1557
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,240
And yet you say it all the time.

1558
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,240
I'm in the harbor!

1559
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,240
There is no way I'm finishing this game.

1560
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,240
No!

1561
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,240
But I want to finish it.

1562
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,240
I hate playing games and not finishing them.

1563
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,240
It kills my soul.

1564
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,240
I don't know.

1565
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,240
I used to watch like a lot of

1566
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,240
like let's play,

1567
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,240
like let's game it out type things.

1568
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,240
But whenever they don't finish the game,

1569
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:41,240
it freaking does my nips in.

1570
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,240
It annoys me so much.

1571
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,240
I'm like what's going on?

1572
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,240
Where is it?

1573
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,240
Where's what I'm looking for?

1574
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,240
I don't know.

1575
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,240
Does the bother you guys

1576
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,240
when like a streamer starts something

1577
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,240
but they don't end it?

1578
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,240
Like I always try and end it

1579
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,240
as best as I can.

1580
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,240
Did satisfactory release today?

1581
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,240
Oh!

1582
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,240
Is it out of early development?

1583
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,240
Early access?

1584
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,240
Like I like when it's wrapped up

1585
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,240
in one stream as well.

1586
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,240
Like that's why I don't mind

1587
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,240
being an endurance streamer.

1588
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,240
Like obviously,

1589
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,240
you know you can play games

1590
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,240
like Supermarket Simulator or TCG.

1591
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,240
That doesn't count, okay?

1592
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,240
I'm too used to streamers

1593
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,240
never finishing the game.

1594
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,240
As long as someone says the B word,

1595
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,240
that is not only one true time

1596
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:30,240
that I have never done it.

1597
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,240
You know what I'm saying?

1598
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,240
Never.

1599
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,240
I mean Pikmin doesn't count either.

1600
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,240
Wait, satisfactory 1.0 is out?

1601
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,240
Did it?

1602
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,240
Congratulations!

1603
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,240
It's one of the rare steam games

1604
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,240
that go from early access

1605
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,240
and actually be finished.

1606
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,240
The B word?

1607
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,240
There's this video game called

1608
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,240
Blinks, okay?

1609
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,240
And it's a child's game.

1610
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,240
And yet they ask for frame

1611
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,240
perfect move sets, okay?

1612
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,240
Frame perfect?

1613
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,240
I don't know who they think they are.

1614
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,240
Still waiting on Killer Bean forever.

1615
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,240
Oh is that game?

1616
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,240
I don't know that.

1617
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,240
I can hear birds chirping.

1618
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,240
We're in the Garden of Eden.

1619
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,240
Like the hit video game.

1620
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,240
Whoa, why can you not?

1621
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,240
Can you walk to the end of the pole?

1622
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,240
Oh!

1623
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,240
I didn't realize I wasn't supposed to jump there.

1624
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,240
Hold on a minute.

1625
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,240
The crane, the crane, okay.

1626
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:32,240
Save, go from highest checkpoint.

1627
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,240
Puts me over here.

1628
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,240
Killer Bean?

1629
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,240
Almost speedrun strat.

1630
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,240
Pokemon go to the poles.

1631
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,240
Wait, what does that mean?

1632
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,240
Higher than the checkpoint.

1633
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,240
Checkpoint is really true.

1634
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:56,240
Can we get much higher?

1635
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,240
So high.

1636
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,240
Have you ever not heard about Killer Bean?

1637
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Killer Bean Watch Along?

1638
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,240
It's an anime?

1639
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,240
Yes, they're making me confuzzled here.

1640
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,240
Right, if I stay on the-

1641
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,240
You stink.

1642
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Heaven.

1643
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:32,240
You having a lot to say?

1644
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,240
Hmm, whatever.

1645
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,240
It's a movie.

1646
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,240
Oh, Stony or Sweet Summer Train.

1647
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,240
Wait, whoa, what's going on?

1648
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,240
Sorry, just checking.

1649
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,240
These girls and me sent me a message.

1650
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,240
Right, is this supposed to be the Heaven checkpoint then?

1651
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,240
The music that's just looming in the dark is like-

1652
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,240
in the background is like so now.

1653
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,240
He's a bean and he has guns and is a mercenary.

1654
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,240
You know what?

1655
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,240
Right, take me there, load it.

1656
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,240
You've not unlocked it.

1657
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,240
Are we in the city then?

1658
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,240
Right, we're in the city.

1659
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,240
Okay.

1660
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,240
Also me, are these games so satisfying me?

1661
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,240
Where are we?

1662
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:42,240
I have to take a crane that takes an extra 20 seconds.

1663
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:45,240
Unplayable, truly unplayable.

1664
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,240
Okay, right, and I'm around there.

1665
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:54,240
It's like taking me along with it, you know what I mean?

1666
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,240
Whoa.

1667
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,240
Okay, now take me on the hay bales.

1668
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,240
They're bouncy.

1669
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,240
They lied, I thought there were going to be platforms that spin.

1670
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,240
They're telling Fibonacci sequences to me.

1671
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,240
I can't believe it.

1672
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:12,240
Was it one, three, five, sevens?

1673
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:13,240
Was it?

1674
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,240
It can only be divided by itself, until a whole number.

1675
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,240
What plan?

1676
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,240
Immediately, immediately.

1677
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,240
Isn't that just primes?

1678
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,240
Fibonacci, like the hit, from the hit video game Vulture?

1679
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,240
Yeah!

1680
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,240
I don't play more ballet, truly.

1681
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,240
I can't claim on them.

1682
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,240
I can just stay on it then.

1683
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,240
Can I know if it's like a track?

1684
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,240
I was like, I know the band.

1685
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,240
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

1686
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,240
I'm going to read the word, Bouncy.

1687
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,240
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.

1688
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,240
No.

1689
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,240
No, that's wrong.

1690
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,240
One plus one is two.

1691
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,240
Two plus one is three.

1692
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,240
Three and two is five.

1693
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,240
Five and three is eight.

1694
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,240
Eight and five is 13.

1695
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,240
Yeah, that sounds better.

1696
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,240
Okay, and then are we going to miss the slate?

1697
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,240
I think, oh well.

1698
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,240
Might not miss it.

1699
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,240
Might be able to...

1700
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:48,240
Okay, we've got it.

1701
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,240
As you can tell,

1702
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:55,240
Mass wasn't my strong suit at school.

1703
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,240
You know, honestly, you think I've probably been

1704
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:02,240
really confident?

1705
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,240
I always see folk that say that.

1706
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,240
Oh, you have so much confidence as a streamer in that.

1707
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,240
And I was like, how are you in real life?

1708
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,240
And I was like, I can't even look folk in the eyes.

1709
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,240
What made you so confident?

1710
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:19,240
And it's like, you know, the comfort of my room.

1711
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:20,240
My room made me confident.

1712
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
I'm so comfy.

1713
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,240
Everything's nice.

1714
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,240
Everything's cozy.

1715
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:25,240
What's nine plus ten?

1716
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,240
21?

1717
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,240
You stupid.

1718
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,240
You know what I'm saying?

1719
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,240
I can count this many.

1720
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:33,240
Ten.

1721
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,240
Did I reach that?

1722
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,240
Oh, I can.

1723
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,240
Oh, Jesus.

1724
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,240
If you're looking for a solo team,

1725
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,240
I wonder who the dev team is

1726
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,240
if they have anything more.

1727
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,240
I know this game is supposed to be

1728
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,240
made with multiplayer in mind,

1729
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,240
but genuinely satisfying.

1730
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,240
I'm enjoying myself.

1731
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,240
I'm having a good time.

1732
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,240
I can't imagine completing this,

1733
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,240
though, as a four-man team.

1734
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:04,240
This looks like it would take literal days

1735
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,240
for four people to sync up perfectly.

1736
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,240
Yeah, that's kind of

1737
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,240
genuinely and wholeheartedly insane.

1738
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,240
We jump stream.

1739
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,240
I don't even think I'm 50% of the way through the game.

1740
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,240
And I've been at the height of 1,800 meters,

1741
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:28,240
so I don't know what the height of the end of the game is.

1742
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,240
Maybe 10,000 meters?

1743
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,240
Does anyone know?

1744
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:38,240
You're having a good time, good time.

1745
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,240
Don't stop me now.

1746
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,240
I'm having such a good time.

1747
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,240
I'm having a ball.

1748
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,240
I don't want to stop at all.

1749
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:48,240
Mommy, that's not how math works.

1750
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,240
Wait, what are those things?

1751
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,240
Wait, what did I say?

1752
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,240
Me and my cousin played the game.

1753
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:58,240
We finished the game in 10 hours.

1754
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,240
Bro, are you still cousins after that?

1755
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,240
In the nicest way, have you disowned each other yet?

1756
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:08,240
Oh, is that how you can get around Wincest?

1757
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,240
Just disown each other, do it,

1758
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,240
and then rename yourselves

1759
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,240
once you've finished having your fun?

1760
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,240
I feel like that's a really good legal...

1761
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,240
What on earth am I supposed to do here?

1762
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,240
I'm supposed to avoid the rocks.

1763
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,240
Okay, I mean...

1764
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,240
Shit.

1765
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,240
You're not making it easy for me.

1766
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,240
Uh...

1767
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:39,240
Okay.

1768
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,240
Am I skinny enough?

1769
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,240
Okay, I'm skinny enough.

1770
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,240
I'm on the OZM pick.

1771
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,240
Then are you worried?

1772
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,240
Then are you worried?

1773
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,240
Disowning someone is not a legal thing, mommy.

1774
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,240
Oh, do you not have to go to court

1775
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,240
and be like, we're not related anymore?

1776
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:01,240
Like, you legally change my surname

1777
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,240
because I don't want to be a part of this family?

1778
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,240
It's a hack.

1779
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,240
Okay, this is getting a bit scary up here, though.

1780
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,240
Oh.

1781
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,240
Oh my god, the game's so kind.

1782
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,240
They stop spawning it the closer you get.

1783
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:25,240
No, please don't you ever listen to me.

1784
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,240
With this one weird trick,

1785
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,240
normies hate it.

1786
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,240
You can get around to consenting adults.

1787
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:34,240
Shocking.

1788
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,240
Honestly, don't listen to me, though.

1789
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,240
I'm completely lost.

1790
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,240
I admit it.

1791
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,240
I admit it.

1792
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:43,240
You already know my viewpoints on it.

1793
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,240
I admit it.

1794
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,240
I admit what others are too afraid to say.

1795
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,240
What do I do?

1796
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,240
Oh!

1797
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,240
What?

1798
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,240
Okay, hold on.

1799
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:05,240
Someone called into Texas.

1800
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,240
She's lost the plot.

1801
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,240
I'll come...

1802
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,240
Hold on.

1803
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,240
You know what?

1804
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:15,240
Right, right, right, right, right.

1805
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,240
I'll wait one second and then go.

1806
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,240
Okay, there we go.

1807
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,240
I need to aim it.

1808
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,240
That looks right.

1809
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:29,240
No, it doesn't.

1810
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,240
Keep shocking behavior.

1811
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,240
Keep going.

1812
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,240
I'm allowed to say it.

1813
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,240
Apparently it gets you in trouble and stuff.

1814
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,240
And I'm just like...

1815
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,240
I'm shocked.

1816
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,240
Shocked, I say.

1817
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,240
I know, I can't believe it.

1818
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,240
The mastermind behind Amy's creation.

1819
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,240
Yes, I'm going to court to change my last name to Beezus.

1820
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,240
Stop!

1821
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,240
That would be so cute.

1822
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:03,240
Don't actually do it, though.

1823
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,240
I think your family would legit disown you.

1824
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,240
Thank you.

1825
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,240
I'd find it cute, anyway.

1826
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:11,240
I'd find it cute.

1827
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
I'm already 120th done in the game.

1828
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,240
Are you serious?

1829
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:17,240
There's that much to this game?

1830
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,240
I mean, I believe you.

1831
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,240
Is this not where I'm supposed to go?

1832
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,240
Am I supposed to jump off that pier, then?

1833
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,240
Almost 200,000 p...

1834
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,240
2,000 pings?

1835
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,240
Wait, I can't figure out how to get...

1836
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,240
progress in.

1837
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:43,240
I'll go climb this...yup.

1838
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,240
That's where I came from.

1839
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,240
Cotton-eyed Joe?

1840
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:51,240
Because where did I come from?

1841
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,240
And where did I go?

1842
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,240
No, you...what?

1843
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,240
Am I not supposed to go there?

1844
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,240
How did I get on that platform in particular?

1845
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,240
Enosys.

1846
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,240
Are you winning?

1847
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,240
A wee bit, kind of.

1848
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,240
I'm a bit unsure what...

1849
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:23,240
how I get onto that edge, but...

1850
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,240
I'm good at edge normally, so I think we'll be okay.

1851
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,240
So I think we'll be okay.

1852
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,240
Oh, you've finally got to the bottom

1853
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,240
of why I say enolines.

1854
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,240
Because after we have

1855
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,240
conducted our enosys...

1856
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,240
Why can I not climb?

1857
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,240
It's really like a secret.

1858
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,240
I can climb onto that.

1859
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,240
I can't climb onto that.

1860
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,240
And it looks like I need to climb onto this.

1861
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,240
But it's not letting me.

1862
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,240
I can't believe it.

1863
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,240
The only reason I can't progress is because I'm too daft.

1864
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,240
That cannae be right.

1865
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,240
It must be something with the top of the boat.

1866
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,240
Because...what the fuck is this?

1867
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,240
Nope.

1868
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,240
Right, hold on.

1869
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,240
Right, hold on, hold on.

1870
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,240
I'm just spamming this space bar.

1871
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
Is it like a ledge thing?

1872
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,240
Uh, anyone played this game before?

1873
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,240
Does anyone know the answer?

1874
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,240
Uh...

1875
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,240
Don't think I won't open up marshmallows

1876
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,240
in yet for half an hour, because I'll do it.

1877
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,240
Hold on.

1878
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,240
Don't let me cook! That's the problem!

1879
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240
When you let me cook, I get in trouble.

1880
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,240
Come on.

1881
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,240
Come on.

1882
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
Come on.

1883
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:57,240
What? What's not clicking?

1884
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,240
Something isn't...

1885
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,240
This?

1886
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,240
You've...

1887
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,240
You've frickin' fricks!

1888
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,240
When will you learn?

1889
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,240
When will you learn your actions upset me?

1890
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:13,240
Right, okay.

1891
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,240
I'm sorry, I don't know...

1892
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,240
This?

1893
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,240
Okay.

1894
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,240
Okay, that's fine.

1895
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,240
That was very anticlimactic.

1896
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,240
Very, very anticlimactic.

1897
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,240
Dude.

1898
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:37,240
Prepare to suffer and regret ever wanting to leave?

1899
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,240
Why would...

1900
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,240
Why would we be suffering?

1901
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,240
Every day I'm suffering.

1902
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,240
Where are we?

1903
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,240
A chopper.

1904
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,240
Okay, next...

1905
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,240
Next location.

1906
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,240
Take me, Mr. Chopper!

1907
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,240
Uh, yeah, there...

1908
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,240
I have no idea how long the base game takes, but...

1909
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,240
That's rough.

1910
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,240
That's rough.

1911
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,240
Get to the chopper.

1912
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,240
Uh, I see platforms.

1913
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:29,240
Apparently we are at the floating, levitating rocks of Pandora now.

1914
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,240
Yes, I like Avatar.

1915
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,240
Both can.

1916
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,240
But I've only seen Avatar, the last airbender.

1917
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,240
I've not seen the Legend of Korra.

1918
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:39,240
Okay, we're at the temple now.

1919
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:43,240
I don't know how far in the temple is, but we're at the temple.

1920
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,240
What if you just jump back down?

1921
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,240
I'll do it at the end.

1922
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,240
I'll see what, uh...

1923
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,240
Predator, what's long when?

1924
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,240
Like, Alien vs. Predator?

1925
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:01,240
I've only seen Alien 1 and then that Alien...

1926
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
Other 1.

1927
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,240
Prometheus, I saw Prometheus.

1928
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,240
I actually really enjoyed Prometheus.

1929
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,240
I think there's a new Alien movie that came out.

1930
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:11,240
I assume I claimed the vines?

1931
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:13,240
Yeah.

1932
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,240
Gotta get the Unobtainable.

1933
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
Oh.

1934
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,240
Wait, well there's something over here as well.

1935
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,240
A random platform if I were to...

1936
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,240
fall down, I guess.

1937
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,240
Lika Drug Fiend?

1938
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,240
Thank you, the beauty lord, for the tip.

1939
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,240
Lika Drug Fiend?

1940
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,240
Lika Drug Fiend?

1941
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:39,240
I mean, hopefully I have enough content to make you laugh.

1942
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:45,240
Someone sent me another thingy.

1943
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,240
And it was like, oh, uh...

1944
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,240
Easy, easy, steady, steady.

1945
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,240
Clean that stem, clean that stem.

1946
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,240
Alien Romulus of Water Shrooms, awesome.

1947
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,240
Yeah, I've not seen it yet.

1948
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,240
Overdose on Strony?

1949
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,240
How would you get too many tingles?

1950
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,240
I guess I can get up here?

1951
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,240
Yeah.

1952
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,240
Ooh, a bubble.

1953
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,240
Would be a shame if I popped it.

1954
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,240
Huh?

1955
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,240
Wait, whoa!

1956
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,240
Why is it moving?

1957
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:25,240
Oh, it's making the platforms appear.

1958
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,240
Okay.

1959
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,240
It's making the platforms appear.

1960
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:33,240
Uh, just gotta keep it in with a bubble.

1961
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Okay, it's going a bit further ahead.

1962
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:37,240
Not to panic anyone, but it's going a bit ahead.

1963
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,240
Don't panic!

1964
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,240
Don't panic!

1965
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,240
Stop panicking!

1966
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,240
I'm coming!

1967
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,240
Oh my god, I think I just saw the back of it there.

1968
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,240
Okay, don't panic.

1969
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,240
Don't panic.

1970
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,240
You're panicking, I don't know where you're panicking.

1971
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,240
I'm panicking.

1972
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,240
Oh, someone's screaming in the background.

1973
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:59,240
Okay.

1974
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,240
Okay.

1975
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,240
Don't panic.

1976
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,240
Oding on Strony is when you ink four times in a row!

1977
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,240
Honestly!

1978
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,240
Thank you, Mr. Bubble,

1979
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,240
for your service.

1980
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,240
We're really thankful.

1981
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,240
Please don't ever do that again.

1982
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,240
That's scary.

1983
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,240
We're like, we are in Pandora.

1984
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,240
Hello, it's there.

1985
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,240
Ooh, there's like

1986
01:31:25,240 --> 01:31:27,240
visual stuff

1987
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,240
to look at.

1988
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,240
Mmm.

1989
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,240
Oh, it's Aztec!

1990
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,240
Wow, what do we feel about Aztec

1991
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,240
Reflings?

1992
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,240
What do we feel about Aztec

1993
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,240
inspirations on things?

1994
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,240
Hmm.

1995
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,240
What do we feel

1996
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,240
about Aztec

1997
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,240
an inspired

1998
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,240
to bring eternal reason?

1999
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,240
Oh, that's so cute!

2000
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,240
I got like a little game I get to play.

2001
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:01,240
It's cool.

2002
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,240
Oh, you like Aztec things?

2003
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,240
Okay.

2004
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,240
Just checking.

2005
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,240
Just wondering, you know.

2006
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,240
Just thinking.

2007
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Thinking out loud.

2008
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,240
La la la la la la la la la la la.

2009
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,240
Hmm.

2010
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,240
How did that even work out?

2011
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,240
I don't know.

2012
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,240
I'll take the wings though.

2013
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,240
Sacrificing each other?

2014
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,240
No, actually not

2015
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,240
sacrifice at all.

2016
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,240
A rather unique

2017
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,240
unique

2018
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,240
cool gamer moves, literally.

2019
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,240
Opening something.

2020
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,240
Oh, this door. Okay.

2021
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,240
This is cool.

2022
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,240
I like this.

2023
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,240
Are you squidding me right now?

2024
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,240
Are you squidding me right now?

2025
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,240
Oh, Brian!

2026
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,240
No, Brian!

2027
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,240
Brian.

2028
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,240
Brian.

2029
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,240
Brian needs coffee apparently.

2030
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,240
This is the first day.

2031
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,240
He's like really struggled.

2032
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,240
Hmm.

2033
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
Brian, my love.

2034
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,240
The forbidden love.

2035
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,240
That was like five minutes later,

2036
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,240
literally.

2037
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,240
Imagine...

2038
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,240
Imagine a Latino region.

2039
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,240
Yeah, wouldn't that be fucking awesome?

2040
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,240
Wouldn't that be crazy?

2041
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Wouldn't that be...

2042
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,240
Wait, what?!

2043
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,240
Stop with the IQ puzzles.

2044
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,240
Right now.

2045
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,240
What?!

2046
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,240
I'm looking.

2047
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,240
Um...

2048
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,240
My eyes are open.

2049
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,240
Cash grab time is over.

2050
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,240
Yeah, clearly.

2051
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,240
They were not kidding when they were like,

2052
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,240
yeah, we're gonna make this hard.

2053
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,240
How is...

2054
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:13,240
Anyone supposed to complete this game?

2055
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,240
Yeah, wouldn't be crazy if a Latina

2056
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,240
or a Spanish kind of

2057
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,240
applied.

2058
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,240
Wouldn't that be nice?

2059
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,240
Wouldn't that be...

2060
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,240
Wouldn't that be nice?

2061
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,240
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

2062
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,240
What the fuck am I...

2063
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,240
I don't get it.

2064
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,240
So what?

2065
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,240
I jump on the platform and then what?

2066
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,240
Are these ropes real?

2067
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,240
No, they're not. What?!

2068
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,240
The ropes aren't real.

2069
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,240
So then...

2070
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,240
I literally...

2071
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,240
That?!

2072
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,240
Oh, the ropes aren't real.

2073
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,240
I thought I had to, like,

2074
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,240
a combination with the ropes figure a way out.

2075
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,240
Up.

2076
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,240
Yeah, sorry.

2077
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,240
Sorry.

2078
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,240
Things do take me a few extra moments

2079
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,240
that you might get instantly.

2080
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,240
My apologies, good refling.

2081
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,240
Thank you for your patience.

2082
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,240
I love listening to...

2083
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,240
Yes, imagine...

2084
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,240
Imagine, I'd just say...

2085
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,240
Action.

2086
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,240
Hold on.

2087
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,240
Hold on, you slut.

2088
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,240
We're trying to learn a bit of something else.

2089
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,240
¿Cómo estás?

2090
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,240
Puta madre.

2091
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,240
Mmm.

2092
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,240
All right.

2093
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,240
Well, Strani, you can't just pick people

2094
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,240
purely based on their voice.

2095
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,240
Yes, I can, and I will.

2096
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,240
What are you going to do about it?

2097
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,240
What are you going to do about it?

2098
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,240
I want a sexy little Latina.

2099
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,240
I want a little slutty.

2100
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,240
Uh...

2101
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,240
Shiny.

2102
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,240
Wait, what?

2103
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,240
Strani, you can't do that.

2104
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,240
Well, I'm not the only one on the hiring team, so...

2105
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,240
Well...

2106
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,240
Don't make me fall for more accents.

2107
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,240
Mmm.

2108
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,240
Accents are on the desirable.

2109
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,240
Accents are very, very desirable.

2110
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,240
Eh.

2111
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,240
At this point in time,

2112
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,240
this one's going to say hola.

2113
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,240
Could you imagine that?

2114
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,240
Hola. ¿Cómo estás?

2115
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,240
¿Cómo estás?

2116
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,240
I don't know what her voice would sound like.

2117
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,240
¿Puta madre?

2118
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,240
No, do a Spanish accent.

2119
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,240
Hola.

2120
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,240
¿Cómo estás?

2121
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,240
Oh, mi hoy, mi hoy.

2122
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,240
I don't know any Spanish.

2123
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,240
I'm so sorry.

2124
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,240
Give me a Spanish sentence,

2125
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,240
and I'll pretend to be Spanish.

2126
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,240
I'm such a loser.

2127
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,240
Mommy's too Scottish to pull off, honestly.

2128
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,240
The Asian Shrine.

2129
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,240
As opposed to...

2130
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,240
The Scottish Shrine?

2131
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,240
Was that doodable?

2132
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,240
Mi hoy, mi hoy. It might have been.

2133
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,240
I don't know, I see that meme everywhere, but I've never played it.

2134
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,240
Te amo.

2135
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:19,240
Te amo mucho.

2136
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,240
Riefling.

2137
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,240
Yeah, I cannot do a Spanish accent.

2138
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,240
I can't think of any Spanish content

2139
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,240
of consumed either

2140
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,240
to mimic someone's accent.

2141
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,240
As a Spanish guy,

2142
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,240
put a madre.

2143
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,240
To say coqueño,

2144
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,240
you also go cocaína.

2145
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,240
To say...

2146
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,240
my name is, you say soy.

2147
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,240
So I'd be like soy strone.

2148
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:51,240
¿Tienes que ir a la biblioteca?

2149
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,240
Oh, ¿dónde está la biblioteca?

2150
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,240
Yeah, that's what I need.

2151
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,240
I need a bright little fucking

2152
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,240
espanol, or a bright little latina.

2153
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,240
That'd be great.

2154
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,240
Or a tomboy. I'll take a tomboy.

2155
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,240
Or...

2156
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,240
I think there's something programmed in terms

2157
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,240
to be attracted to foreign accents.

2158
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,240
I think because it's different, it's new

2159
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,240
and unique.

2160
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,240
I cannot overstate how boring

2161
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,240
my voice is to literally any other

2162
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:25,240
Scott, but...

2163
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,240
Where the fuck

2164
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,240
am I going? I'm genuinely lost in Chinatown

2165
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,240
right now.

2166
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,240
Where's my boss lady?

2167
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,240
I want my noodles.

2168
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,240
Where's my auntie?

2169
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,240
I can't find my auntie, I'm lost.

2170
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,240
Your pronunciations are really good.

2171
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,240
I do love taking

2172
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,240
a good shot in the dark.

2173
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,240
Oh yeah, to say soy

2174
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,240
is like gracias.

2175
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,240
Oh no, that's thank you, dumbass.

2176
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,240
Gracias.

2177
01:38:57,240 --> 01:38:59,240
Can I go up here?

2178
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,240
Bruh, I'm lost in Chinatown

2179
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,240
the fuck.

2180
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,240
Oh, right.

2181
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,240
Okay, well, the platform

2182
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,240
things are probably a hint to where to get started.

2183
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,240
So what, up here?

2184
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,240
Oh, oh, just look up.

2185
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,240
Okay, five head.

2186
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,240
Sorry equals perdón.

2187
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,240
Perdón.

2188
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,240
Perdón. How do you say mister?

2189
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,240
Perdón, señor.

2190
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,240
Oh, yabliet.

2191
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,240
Are you? Wait, if I go reload

2192
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,240
last checkpoint, it's totally not

2193
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,240
going to put me there. It's going to put me...

2194
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,240
Only up stonks.

2195
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,240
You can say perdón or lo siento.

2196
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,240
Lo siento.

2197
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,240
Oh, Johnny.

2198
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,240
La janta es moluca.

2199
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,240
Perdón.

2200
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,240
Lo siento.

2201
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,240
Oh, señor.

2202
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,240
Señor, gimme ya.

2203
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,240
How do you say winches?

2204
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,240
I don't know how you say a winner in Spanish.

2205
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,240
I know

2206
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,240
it's ochinchin

2207
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,240
in Japanese.

2208
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,240
Spanish.

2209
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,240
What? Actually, you know what?

2210
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,240
You actually can wait.

2211
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,240
Right, it better put me higher.

2212
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,240
Alright, thank you.

2213
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,240
A penne.

2214
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,240
Penne.

2215
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,240
Sa chicha.

2216
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,240
Sa chicha.

2217
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,240
Oh, you know what?

2218
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,240
Tackle

2219
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,240
in Spanish is tackle.

2220
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,240
Thank you.

2221
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,240
You know, right, what's going on here?

2222
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,240
Why can't that brain not process

2223
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,240
it?

2224
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,240
Is it moving?

2225
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,240
Is that what it is?

2226
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,240
I think it's moving.

2227
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,240
It has to be.

2228
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,240
Is that moving forward and backwards?

2229
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,240
Or am I just really bad at this game?

2230
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,240
I'm just really slow.

2231
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,240
Okay, right, let's do it.

2232
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,240
Mm-hmm.

2233
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,240
Oh, right. Okay, we did it.

2234
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,240
We got past it and we've defeated the evil.

2235
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,240
You just keep stopping perfectly

2236
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,240
for it to whack you off.

2237
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,240
Chinese food in China

2238
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,240
is just cold food. Right.

2239
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,240
Enough.

2240
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,240
Reflins.

2241
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,240
Reflins.

2242
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,240
If Penne to his penne,

2243
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,240
what is

2244
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,240
chupanopika?

2245
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,240
He just craves the spank, honestly.

2246
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:40,240
Right, let's get right

2247
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,240
into the claim.

2248
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,240
Right, I will

2249
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,240
wrap up the next time I fall off.

2250
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,240
I will read some marshmallows

2251
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,240
and then I'll redirect into Shibi.

2252
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,240
What's Shibi doing today, Reflins?

2253
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,240
You must tell me. You must tell me at once.

2254
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,240
I'm redirecting into Shibi

2255
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,240
in 20 minutes.

2256
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,240
Italian.

2257
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,240
Tackle to backwards is

2258
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,240
Oh, she playing the monkey game.

2259
01:42:08,240 --> 01:42:10,240
Monkey.

2260
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:12,240
Monkey. Monkey.

2261
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:15,240
Remember that time they

2262
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,240
remastered Super Monkey Ball Deluxe

2263
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,240
and I played the OG version like a dumbass?

2264
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,240
Because I didn't know better?

2265
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,240
Because I didn't know better?

2266
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:25,240
Mm-hmm.

2267
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,240
That's right. I didn't know any better.

2268
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,240
I didn't know

2269
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,240
any better.

2270
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,240
Monkey.

2271
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,240
Who goes there?

2272
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,240
Oh, okay.

2273
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,240
Yeah.

2274
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,240
Accidental SPH stream.

2275
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,240
Wait, what did I say?

2276
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,240
I already forgot. Oh, it bounces.

2277
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:51,240
Thanks for the stream.

2278
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,240
Fuck it, steady on. I'm no ended yet.

2279
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:55,240
Shibi's not even up yet.

2280
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,240
Fuck it now.

2281
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,240
Getting ding-dong ditched already.

2282
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,240
I can't believe it.

2283
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,240
The original monkey before Goku?

2284
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:05,240
Is Goku a monkey?

2285
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,240
No.

2286
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,240
It's not Goku. It's like that Laffy

2287
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,240
one is a monkey.

2288
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,240
I'm like 99% sure Laffy's a monkey.

2289
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,240
I think he's from one piece.

2290
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,240
Oh, who goes there?

2291
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,240
Uh...

2292
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,240
He meant your Super Monkey Ball stream.

2293
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,240
Oh, when I said that, yeah.

2294
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,240
To be fair,

2295
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,240
I don't know how that didn't let me go in.

2296
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,240
I saw it.

2297
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,240
But what am I supposed to do with that one inch?

2298
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,240
Like...

2299
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,240
I was right. I'm right. You're wrong.

2300
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,240
There's nothing you can do about it.

2301
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,240
Goku is a Saiyan

2302
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,240
which is a race of space monkey people.

2303
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,240
What the fuck?

2304
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,240
What is going on in that anime?

2305
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,240
I'm like, as long as you guys are happy,

2306
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,240
what is going on in that anime?

2307
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,240
Huh.

2308
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:05,240
Hey! Wait.

2309
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,240
Hold on. Mommy's missing something.

2310
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,240
Oh, it's this.

2311
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,240
I don't have time to claim on it.

2312
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:19,240
No, no, no, no. Come back. I'm sorry.

2313
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,240
No, baby. Come back.

2314
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,240
No! I'll make it up to you.

2315
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,240
Fuck.

2316
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,240
Did you just call him Laffy?

2317
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,240
A monkey anime guy named Laffy?

2318
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,240
Saiyan?

2319
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,240
I want to hear you pronounce Laffy's name again.

2320
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,240
Oh, Laffy!

2321
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,240
Is it with a U? Laffy?

2322
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,240
Isn't this a little chain together

2323
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,240
just basically only up?

2324
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,240
Wait, is there a game called only up?

2325
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,240
Laffy?

2326
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:51,240
Oh my god. Wait, I can't get on board.

2327
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,240
Okay, I can get on board now.

2328
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,240
One, two,

2329
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,240
three, one,

2330
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,240
two, three,

2331
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,240
one, two,

2332
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,240
fuck this. I'm off.

2333
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,240
Stash Power.

2334
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,240
Son Goku is based off of Song Wukong.

2335
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,240
Both have

2336
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,240
an flying cloud.

2337
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,240
Both have a magical staff that extends near

2338
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,240
infinity. Both achieve godlike power.

2339
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,240
Okay. Thank you, Stash Power for the tip.

2340
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,240
I'm learning.

2341
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,240
Laffy is

2342
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,240
Laffy like Guffey.

2343
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,240
Laffy, Guffey.

2344
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,240
Laffy.

2345
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,240
Only up was the one that got removed

2346
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,240
from her stone assets.

2347
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,240
Oh.

2348
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,240
It's pronounced

2349
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,240
Luffy.

2350
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,240
Right, so controversial take.

2351
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,240
Why is it no spell

2352
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,240
Luffy?

2353
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,240
Have you ever thought about that?

2354
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,240
Why it's no spell like that?

2355
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,240
My name's

2356
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,240
Stroney.

2357
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:53,240
Okay, Stroney.

2358
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:55,240
Right?

2359
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,240
Ken, how there's no random

2360
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,240
letters that are not even a part of

2361
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,240
my name in it? Aye.

2362
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,240
What is going on? It's because he's Brazilian.

2363
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:05,240
Oh my god, come to Brazil.

2364
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:07,240
Cousin Japan, there's no Lu.

2365
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,240
It's Lu. Oh, it's La?

2366
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,240
Oh, right. Okay, hold on.

2367
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,240
I'll take it back. I'll take it back.

2368
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,240
Sorry, forgive my ignorance.

2369
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,240
Saronzo.

2370
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,240
Because it's written.

2371
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,240
Okay, should we call you

2372
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,240
Saronny? No.

2373
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:25,240
Do not call me Ministerone Soup.

2374
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:27,240
I've had enough. Whoa.

2375
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,240
Okay.

2376
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:39,240
Monkey. Monkey.

2377
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,240
Monkey.

2378
01:46:43,240 --> 01:46:45,240
Hmm.

2379
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:47,240
Oh, this one's cute. What the heck?

2380
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:49,240
I like this.

2381
01:47:05,240 --> 01:47:07,240
I have been awarded a platform.

2382
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,240
Oh, no.

2383
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:11,240
It tilts.

2384
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:15,240
Ministerone.

2385
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:17,240
I'm just out here mining.

2386
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,240
I'm just out here mining.

2387
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,240
I'm a cover in the Minecraft

2388
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,240
shippost song.

2389
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:25,240
Oh, it was a shippost.

2390
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,240
But yeah, I wanted to

2391
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,240
see if AC would be done for doing.

2392
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:31,240
Why is this dealer?

2393
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:33,240
Taking the piece I've been

2394
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,240
standing here

2395
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,240
for 13 minutes.

2396
01:47:37,240 --> 01:47:39,240
Like, I'd love it in a wee accent.

2397
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,240
I don't want to be so cute,

2398
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,240
but I don't want to give AC any more work.

2399
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:45,240
I have to wait until

2400
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,240
the girls come to me.

2401
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,240
No, I can't laugh yet.

2402
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,240
This is so cute.

2403
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:55,240
Right. I promise I'm going to wrap up.

2404
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:57,240
Wait a minute.

2405
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,240
The game's a thick tunnel.

2406
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:01,240
I'll see you that much.

2407
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,240
Okay.

2408
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,240
What is this dealer?

2409
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:09,240
Oh, my God.

2410
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,240
It's Legolord of the Rings.

2411
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:13,240
Oh, right. Okay.

2412
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:15,240
Well, speaking of Legolord of the Rings,

2413
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:17,240
I'm going to open up Marshmallows

2414
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:19,240
very quickly.

2415
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:21,240
Shawnee, have you ever seen Death Note?

2416
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:23,240
I saw this, like, the first few episodes,

2417
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:25,240
but I never finished it.

2418
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,240
But I do want to actually finish it.

2419
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,240
But I don't know how long it is either.

2420
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,240
Brian.

2421
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:33,240
Brian.

2422
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,240
Darlan.

2423
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:37,240
Wait.

2424
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:39,240
You're going to be talking to me when the

2425
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:41,240
I'm having the time.

2426
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,240
For my donation.

2427
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,240
For my tip that's been like, 30 minutes ago.

2428
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,240
I'll let you know.

2429
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,240
Hey, Shawnee, I want to tell you

2430
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:51,240
an embarrassing Legol story.

2431
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:53,240
What? You shoved one up your ass.

2432
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:57,240
Hi, Shawnee, I want to tell you an

2433
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:59,240
embarrassing Legol story that happened to

2434
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:01,240
me when I was a kid. There's not...

2435
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:03,240
There's a not Lego company that used to

2436
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:05,240
make Halo kits to build.

2437
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,240
I was probably 12, 13 years old

2438
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:13,000
However, there was a production issue or something and there were a few pieces that didn't fit together no matter how hard I tried.

2439
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,680
It got to the point where I started crying out frustration. My mom walked in and was wondering why I was crying and explained that I couldn't build it.

2440
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:25,400
We took it back to the store to return it. My mom told the lady at the return counter that I cried because I couldn't put it together and I was really embarrassed.

2441
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:30,600
Oh no, that's an out of context story though. That's not nice.

2442
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:35,640
If it makes you feel better, I cried at Kung Fu Chaos and my dad never comforted me.

2443
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:46,680
So I was playing Kung Fu Chaos and I got 5 stars in the director's last mission.

2444
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:50,840
Now this is as a child obviously. I was like 3 years old or something playing this.

2445
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:55,000
I thought I got 5 stars but he took it away the last second.

2446
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,240
So I burst out crying and I went to my dad to comfort me.

2447
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:05,240
But not to be stereotypical but he just didn't know how to comfort me.

2448
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:10,600
All he had to do was pat me on the back and be like, there there strongy, you'll get him next time.

2449
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:19,480
But he didn't know what to say and I just remember thinking like, oh I'm not going back to my dad for emotional support again. What was that?

2450
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:25,480
And obviously I just never cried at a video game since then.

2451
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:34,760
But it was really good. Is your dad also just like, oh wait until I tell you about World War 2 and World War 1 planes.

2452
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:38,760
You want to know why I know so much about World War 1 and 2 planes?

2453
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,880
Hi Stormy, hi Wiefling. I have nothing waiting to say, I just want to let you know I love you.

2454
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:52,360
Please sit on my face. I love you too, yes I was sitting here.

2455
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,240
An attempt was made, much as many such cases.

2456
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:01,880
That hit someone considering my dad. Yeah, there's a reason

2457
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:06,280
he was really happy. I play like Crimson Skies and Mech Stuff.

2458
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:16,840
The Spitfire I believe is his favorite plane. Mine personally is the SR-71, the Blackbird, it's my favorite.

2459
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,320
Need autistic children with strongy.

2460
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:25,320
Aww, you want to give me pregnant? You want to give me a baby?

2461
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:29,240
I'm obviously a thing. I'm waiting.

2462
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:36,600
Crimson Skies. Yes, I played Crimson Skies because of my dad.

2463
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:45,160
Bias is a strona ski, the Imposka. Is that real?

2464
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:53,160
It's me. Is that real? Wait, what part? The Crimson Skies where I played that game or the ovulation pun?

2465
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:59,320
Blackbird is your favorite too? Yeah, yeah, the SR-71.

2466
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:05,080
The most interesting plane I have learned about. There may be other planes out there that I haven't learned about, but yeah.

2467
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,840
Forcing your daughter to listen to your hyper fixation.

2468
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:14,440
It was just like how it got passed then. Like my dad played video games, I watched him play video games,

2469
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,600
I then played video games. It's just kind of like a simulation. You do what's around you

2470
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:25,480
and my dad watches. That's what I was saying. When my dad was here, I don't know who's playing. Is it War?

2471
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:31,160
Not Warhammer. That War Thunder game, someone made a video and it was like,

2472
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:37,160
what if we dropped an atomic bomb and a thing and he was sitting watching it and I was just like, yep, that's my dad.

2473
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:43,240
He's just happy watching plane. Yeah, yeah, War Thunder. He was watching people

2474
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:49,720
record videos and all that. You play it? Well, if you upload videos, my dad probably watches you.

2475
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:55,720
Because he says he's too old to play games these days, which he's not. I'm gonna try and get him to

2476
01:52:55,720 --> 01:53:01,480
play PC build simulator because I think he'd really enjoy it. He likes building his own PCs.

2477
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:07,960
Like he built my PC back in Scotland and all of that. My sister gave a TV remote without batteries

2478
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:15,080
and said, that press and the buttons helped her. Aw, you got got. I have a friend who has

2479
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:19,720
6,000 hours in that game. Yeah, my dad feels the same way. I could totally,

2480
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:25,080
I could totally chill watching that stuff with him. Literally, fucking bit of video game stuff but

2481
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,200
anything nerdy and all that and you're good to go with my dad. You don't have to be,

2482
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:36,360
oh what happens if we don't, you know, Stormy's dad wouldn't accept me because they didn't. No,

2483
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:42,040
my dad's a nerd. I'm a nerd. We're all nerds. Life's good. Okay, life is good.

2484
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:47,240
A bit of cellic on the side, that's all. A bit of cellic, a bit of green. Green's our color,

2485
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:51,720
all right? Green is the color of the Cuddles family. So if you like green,

2486
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:57,640
so a tank feature bar, you want fucking panzer and gentoo? No.

2487
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:04,520
I wanted to play World of Warcraft on my pops and miss the pandora but he quit because he felt

2488
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:08,600
too slow. Yeah, my dad says that to me. He's like, I'm too slow for video games and I want to shake

2489
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:13,640
him and be like, no dad, don't say that. I hate when my dad acknowledges he's getting older,

2490
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:21,640
it freaks me the fuck out. I'm just like, I can't handle it. I could, I cannot handle it.

2491
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:25,480
I cannot handle it. I hate when he acknowledges he's getting older. It freaks me out.

2492
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:34,200
It freaks me out. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. Right, customization. Redirect into

2493
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:39,480
she be cut and bum, but she's not up yet, but that is okay. I'm going to do.

2494
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:47,480
I wonder if we should do a deadlock stream together actually for the next stream game.

2495
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:57,000
Is deadlock in beta? Is it finished? Is it out? What's, what's the story of deadlock at this point

2496
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,720
in time? Because I actually don't know what the story of deadlock is right now. Make a

2497
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:09,640
Vtuber model for your dad, real. Ask your dad about Avril Vulcan sometime.

2498
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:18,120
A stunning dad club win. Unfortunately, he would dox me like within a heartbeat.

2499
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:29,960
No, as much as I would love like a mech type character, it's impossible. It's not possible,

2500
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:37,160
how you say it's not possible. Right, okay, I have sheepster stream. Is it going to work?

2501
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:45,240
Is it worth it? Let me work it. I remember watching my dad play Star Wars Force Unleash.

2502
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:49,320
Oh my God. Yeah, I'm playing Star Wars Force Unleash because of that. My dad played that game

2503
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:57,240
too. We're going to be playing it in October, I think. Most of the dad, my dad was the fucking

2504
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:03,960
T-Rex Vtuber I said no to. Wait until I show you that design. I'll see what happens. As I said,

2505
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:09,240
the concept artist wants to try and submit that girl again to me, but I'm just like a dinny and

2506
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:15,080
move Ivan with it. But well, now that we have two new team members, I can maybe show them that design.

2507
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:20,680
I'm just like, it's fucking ugly. I just don't like it. But I don't know if it's a male versus female

2508
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:26,520
girls. Okay, it might be. It genuinely might be a male versus female girls.

2509
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:38,600
Definitely redirecting and to become one with the monkey stream.

2510
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:48,840
T-Rex woman. Yes, I am. I will leak it. Mommy, do you like Wendy's?

2511
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:54,840
You'd like Wendy's tentacles or lane on your face? Oh, fuck you, Riflin. Wait, what? I thought you

2512
01:56:54,840 --> 01:57:03,320
meant the franchise in America. Riflin, you got me. Boo. Very fine. You get a round of applause for

2513
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:09,400
getting me. There you go. Yeah, laugh it up. You got me. I thought you were talking about the franchise.

2514
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:14,600
My dad's flavor of autism is trains. When I was a kid, he would take me to the train tracks and

2515
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:20,360
watch the train. Oh, that's the name. You'll have nice memories about watching the train.

2516
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:25,800
You need to be invited to access Deadlock. Next time you add me for a stream snip game,

2517
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,640
you can invite me into it. What?

2518
01:57:31,720 --> 01:57:34,920
What? It's not just an open beta?

2519
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:45,560
It's like a one-on-one invite. Like, one person has it and then they can send it to them and then what?

2520
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:52,520
It's fun to toss a stormtrooper. I always max out on lightning as fast as possible.

2521
01:57:56,360 --> 01:58:00,200
Are Emmy's marshmallows still? As far as I'm aware, yeah. I don't think marshmallow,

2522
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:06,600
nothing like that has been affected. When you have it, you can send it to all your friends.

2523
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:17,240
How bizarre. It's an alpha, but if someone gets in, they can invite as many people as they want.

2524
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:23,960
Who? Just open the fucking servers at that point. Oh, if you're in the alpha, you can

2525
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:33,160
invite as many people as you want. Just open the servers. Jeez. Unlimited power. I like lightning.

2526
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:39,080
Nah, just a marketing strategy, which is help. I can't believe it. Valve are doing the tried and

2527
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:44,760
tried and true and tested methods and it's working yet again. Valve is up.

2528
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:52,920
Astroni, have you ever heard of the recent VTuber? No, I'm not saying that name.

2529
01:58:54,840 --> 01:59:00,600
I think, uh, I think Mercy is one of Mercy's first concept and name, who's Candace for a laugh.

2530
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:06,440
Now that you've just reminded me. Speaking of ovulation, do you plan on uploading the picture

2531
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:11,960
this day, despite the current happenings with little sis? Yeah, it's already been

2532
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:17,960
like in quotation marks, the Emmy situation has already been dealt with. If that makes sense,

2533
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:25,640
whatever the result is in 48 hours time will be the result. Okay. So either she starts fresh

2534
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:31,720
or we get their account back. That's how it is. Just to reassure the pinpals again,

2535
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:38,760
when your account gets done for factual thingies, you are not perma-ban. You can make an account

2536
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:47,080
right away. You can start up again the next day if you so desired. So either the account comes back

2537
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:55,160
or it doesn't and Emmy starts fresh. As far as I'm aware, as far as I can see and like as I said,

2538
01:59:55,160 --> 02:00:02,040
like I knew this is a very high possibility. So we're waiting on YouTube's decision on

2539
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:08,520
to see what the result is. So don't worry, she's coming back. There's no perma-bans. That's not

2540
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:13,640
really a thing. Well, it's perma-ban if you do like hatred stuff like that. We don't do that.

2541
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:22,520
Yeah, but the 50k, yes. Obviously, if Emmy were to start fresh, I think all the girls will agree

2542
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:29,400
with me when I say this, that we will put advertisements on her channel and that nature

2543
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:36,200
of things. Emmy got banned when? You didn't hear the news, you Goober? Her account's gone. Her

2544
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:42,120
YouTube account. I got banned a couple of hours ago, I think. I wasn't, I've not been awake.

2545
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:48,440
I woke up like 30-ish minutes before stream. But please don't worry, it's not perma-ban.

2546
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:53,640
So you're just gonna have to support your little sister extra hard, clear?

2547
02:00:53,640 --> 02:01:01,320
Yeah. But yeah, please don't worry. I have been fully aware that this is, it's not deleted, no.

2548
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:10,360
So the appeal's been sent off. We just have to wait. And either they'll say, yes, you can have

2549
02:01:10,360 --> 02:01:15,880
your account back or no, you can't. And if the answer is no, then it's very likely she just

2550
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:22,120
starts fresh and that's it. If she wants to do a funny little mock debut, then sure,

2551
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:30,280
more than happy. Not sure what to do about the old content, no? I hope there's been

2552
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:38,280
Archive and on, possibly. Or would she just want to start completely fresh? I'm not sure.

2553
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:44,200
That's probably what I don't have answers to. Anyway, right, I'm gonna redirect

2554
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:49,880
into Sheepsters, thank you so so much. I do apologise for not having my ever-ending

2555
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:56,680
lurking streams or doing X, Y, Z, L, M, N, O, P. I do need to do quite a lot back around things.

2556
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:00,920
So I'm going to end stream. I'm gonna make a cup of tea. If you're a member,

2557
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:06,760
then I will be watching Austin Powers for the first time. And if you're not a member,

2558
02:02:06,760 --> 02:02:11,480
I will see you tomorrow, as always. And I'm gonna redirect you into my lovely genmate,

2559
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:15,400
Shebecott and Bumble. Please don't, please don't worry. Everything is okay. I assure you.

2560
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:21,960
I did think that far ahead. I know it's surprising that I thought that far ahead,

2561
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:25,960
but please don't worry, okay? Everything's gonna be okay in the end. You know us.

2562
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:33,240
But yes, thank you so so much for the shorter stream. I do apologise for not wrapping it up.

2563
02:02:33,240 --> 02:02:37,480
I didn't realise how big this game was, to be honest. I thought it was like an old thing at the end.

2564
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:42,920
But I will see you cute. It'd be too east tomorrow for stream sniping with Shebe

2565
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,600
on Left 4 Dead. I get to play Left 4 Dead for the first time tomorrow,

2566
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:54,040
which I'm excited about. So don't be shy to add me on. I'll show it on stream,

2567
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:57,800
but don't add me now, but I mean, you already know what to add. Right,

2568
02:02:57,800 --> 02:03:02,600
I'll see you goofy goobers tomorrow. Please enjoy, Shebe. Oh, I'll give you a kiss for,

2569
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:10,200
well, I was gonna say for every metre I've climbed, but yeah, no. Not for 2,600 kisses.

2570
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:13,720
That's a special stream that comes later, okay? Alright, love ya.

2571
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:19,960
See you tomorrow and enjoy Shebe and enjoy me and Shebe tomorrow if you can make it.

2572
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:22,280
You had 26 kisses. Okay.

2573
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:34,280
There we go.

2574
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:34,840
Ta-da.

2575
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:42,600
Enjoy Shebe. See you tomorrow, goofy goobah, or see you in five minutes with Austin Powers.
