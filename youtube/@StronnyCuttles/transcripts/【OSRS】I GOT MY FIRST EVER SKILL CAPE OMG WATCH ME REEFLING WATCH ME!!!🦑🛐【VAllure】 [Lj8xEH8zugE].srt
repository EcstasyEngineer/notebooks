1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mainframe. We hack in the mainframe on this one we plan.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No, it better be puking. One second late. No.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No one's puking. Sorry about what we'll select around. I was on- I was on the wrong world.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, hold on. Let me be bad. Let me be a bad streamer.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's going to chat. I need to say world is 3-8-8.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And we edge in and edge in.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Did I mention how much I dislike vowels and words? It makes spelling things impossible.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Absolutely impossible.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh no, no, no. No vomit. I'm here. No vomit. Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm sorry if I sound like the sleepiest little sleepy head that ever did sleep.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You'll never guess why. It's because I'm a sleepy head.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Shock and behavior, I know.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. How are you?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was just watching your latest collab video with none other than Iciclesnopauseus.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That is her full legal name. Iciclesnopauseus.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's not. I just made that up. Her name is Iciclesnopauseus.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know why I did that. What would-

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I mean, if you wanted to shut up in me and make her nervous.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You know, like when your parents say your full legal name and you know you're in trouble?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Emmys is emo- emo-to-bizu, I guess.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's time. I'm getting the skill-cape. Yes, so just to give a very quick recap.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
For those of you who haven't really kept up the series, no, I'm not insulted.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's literally hours upon hours of ranting gameplay, watch longs, all that jazz.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We are new friends.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're about to hit nine to eight. We have 6,000 wines to go, which is absolutely nothing

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
compared to what on earth we've- what should I name again? Jimmy-bizu.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right. I see Jimmy one more time. Ah, sorry. I named- I couldn't have named Emmy more perfect.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't care what anyone says. I couldn't have named her more perfect, okay?

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I've been- I've been kicked off the development team in the naming department.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, unfortunately, we're not gonna have another fondle of bosom.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And that is- that is the fate, okay? You can't restart. That path has- that path has been- it's been happening, okay?

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She hates when Pimpel says Emmy-bizu from Veal or Generation One and Doll to her full legal name.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Just her government-ish name.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Emm...

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Emm- Emmy-bizu. Ah, sorry, it's bizu.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Eh, en franÃ§ais? Mh? Bizu, monsieur. Bizu pas moi?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just means kiss. There's none really to it.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But yes, if your bidi-little eyes, my darling wreathling is able to see,

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
em, I have 6,800 wines to go,

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
which, in theory- there you go, 6,800.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In theory, if I balls to the walls, this will take us to the four-hour mark.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you squiddling me right now?

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let Mummy name the children.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Mama, you're in the wrong world. We can't find you.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Shit, where am I?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wait, am I not in the right-

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh no! I need to be in 380. Hold on, I'm swapping to 380.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm doing- fuck it, we're doing it live.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes, I want to switch to World 380. What the heck? I want my wreathling.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Sorry.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But yes, eh, today I- oh, there's my wreathling.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There we go. Okay, much better, much better.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Is there vomit on the floor? No, we're safe. There's no cabbage on the floor, okay.

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's my wreathling.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're more than welcome to chill out.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But yes, it has been a childhood little goal of mine to get a skill cape,

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and we- like, we're doing it today.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Like, there's no way we're not getting it done today.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now, I know originally today we're supposed to be the-

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the-

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the what?

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It was supposed to be the information stream type thingy, my Bobber.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I needed time to prepare because I did a lot of background work.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Management told me there was quite a few clippers that applied to the program.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We're really happy.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh, we actually made the VTuber news.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, Christmas miracle.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So obviously it got a bit of a boost, which was really nice.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We got, like, a lot of compliments as well.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like, I saw the response to the clipping program being launched,

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and there's lots of nice comments attached to people being very kind,

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
saying, you know what, that's the fairest I've seen yet.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's this, that's this.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And I'm glad, like, that's what I want.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want, you know, the people that do get accepted into the clipping program,

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you know, I want them to be like, yeah, I'm getting a fair price for what's going on.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And, you know, I don't feel like resentful making these clips or anything,

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
because obviously the more love and appreciation that goes into a clip,

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the more, you know, it translates through and blandering, blandering,

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
it's a strong old-school runescape felt.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I played this game multiple times in my childhood,

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
but what would happen is I would get to level 40 in a skill,

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and then I would get disinterested.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So, on debut, I said, you know what?

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm gonna put it down and write in.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I want a runescape cake before I, like, before, you know, wrap it up, okay?

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not wrapping it up in English, okay?

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, I'm strutting a couple of buns very soon.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And if you are on my alt-twitter, I, I, this sounds so silly.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know I can repeat myself a little bit.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do apologize. Do apologize. I repeat myself.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I have been able to blast through stupendous amounts of work,

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
because it, like, it takes a while for things to click in my head.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And that's fine. I'm slow. I can admit it.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And it clicked that if I blast through my work this week,

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I can go straight back to the fun stuff.

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I'm starting to feel the stress lifting off of my shoulders.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And, like, we've got the third editor in play, like, just everything.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's coming together. You know how every day I come on, like,

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
oh, oh, soon, soon, I don't have to do it.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Soon, soon, I literally do not control, do anything.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's all done by everyone else.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Soon, it's happening.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The pieces are falling together.

105
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The stress is lifting off my shoulders.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can start to feel, I can get a boner again.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Like, I'm starting to feel like that.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I'm getting so excited.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Like, I was on my other, my alt-twitter.

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And there is this artwork that I adore.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And originally it was supposed to be for something,

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but I couldn't stop myself.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I wanted to post it because it's a little rare friend.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And another life when we played Elden Ring together,

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I got wrecked, okay?

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I got wrecked and decked, okay?

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And it was by a lance enemy.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And it was one thrust of a lance, and I died.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So then I said the phrase,

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
one thrust was all it took.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And then did I go to an artist and get that commissioned?

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes, I did.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Shamelessly, I got that commissioned.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't care.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't care.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sorry, I don't care if it's shameless.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
One thrust was all it took from my little reefling, okay?

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The one thrust.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Trying to get a bone bone again.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Good that you're starting to relax and get less work too.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, like, the transitional period of handing over work

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to other people is difficult in terms of,

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
they wouldn't do it my way,

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
but my way isn't the right way.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And that's just a fact.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
My way is not the right way.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I need to get that out of my head right away,

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
because, you know, like, I got a Marshmallow,

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and they were like, I really like AC's new ASMR video,

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but it's very new coded.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And I said, you know, that's perfectly,

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
well, I didn't say anything

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
because, well, we don't reply to Marshmallows,

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
but I was like, yes.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So AC's newest ASMR role play, check it out.

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Check out the link in the description below.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I wrote that to get her back into ASMR,

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and she said that she's really happy

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to do her improv ASMR.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Because if you didn't know,

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
AC is an incredibly creative being,

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and she can, I don't know how she does this.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I have never been more jealous

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
of a cute little adorable polar bear.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
She can do that.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't know.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
She's an adorable, adorable polar bear.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
She can make ASMR off the top of her head.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Like, what?

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You don't have to sit down for an hour

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and write a script and, you know,

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and then off the top of her head improv?

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What? What?

164
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Do you know how much money?

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Do you know how many generations,

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
how many times I would get pregnant

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
by the reeflings if I had this ability?

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It'd be over for your tentacle.

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You'd be milk dry.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You'd be speaking of being milk dry.

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hold on a minute.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Speaking of being milk dry,

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
check what I saw on Twitter.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Check it.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Wait, hold on.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, my OBS just crashed.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't do that again.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Like what I found on Twitter before I booted up.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Speaking of being milk dry,

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
give me my gender right now.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I got this on Twitter.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Thank you very much.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know who you are.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm going to make this my schedule post

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
for next week because I love it so much.

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Look at your wee withered tentacles as well.

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They're all withered.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Have pressure.

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Get that guy a glass of water.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're going to need more than water

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
to replenish what I oink off.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The V-sucky allegations are true.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We're actually just all succubus.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you again, tiny spiny.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm so sorry if I didn't say your name.

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm very all over the place recently.

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Literally, real one.

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Mummy, the spirit is willing,

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
but the tentacle is withered and sore

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
of my babies.

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Lots of water and tomatoes, honestly.

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Maui babies.

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Maui babies.

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Kapiti.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Tomorrow's going to be the education stream

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and then I'm going to come back online

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
because I'm going to be bing-ching

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
d'ajuma with my

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
friend, Arissa.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It will be the first time we have

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
interacted with each other,

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
which I adore.

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I find adorable.

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Tomatoes?

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes, tomatoes replenish your prostate.

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's no other way to say it.

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Look after it, you're going to need it

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
when you're at the milking farm.

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't believe you posted...

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't believe you posted to your

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Patreon even though you put a mental

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
chastity bell on us.

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I mean, I'm not going to be mad

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
if you cheat-sy-doodle

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
because I do need...

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
tomorrow or the day after

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the 20K celebration photos

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
will be made.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's either...

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No, not today, tomorrow.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Tomorrow or the day after.

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm losing it.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Does ketchup count?

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It does count because it contains

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
the compound.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think it's like a lisonin or something

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
like that, which is exactly

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
what they're wanting.

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You needed one day to get over the

241
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
stress of work, so glad it worked.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We're ready for you.

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Fill your agenda.

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh yeah, you want to fill my agenda,

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
right?

246
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's some compound in a tomato

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
cup that begins with L

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and it's what's really good for you.

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Lysopenia?

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know.

251
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Not only the agenda.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Thank you.

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Agenda?

254
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know where I was going with

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that. I'm a mechanic.

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What gender are you?

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm a beach driver.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Have you seen that meme?

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You must stop.

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You must stop because like, oh, what

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
gender are you?

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm a mechanic.

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's literally me.

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Agendinate my balls.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Agenda, germinate.

266
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
When I see it start growing,

267
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it's called germination.

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sure there's some sort of

269
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
joke in here.

270
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm doing it.

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Okay, let me drink my tea before I

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
drink it.

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Estrani Carl's got to be one of

275
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
my favorite genders.

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Thank you. Thank you, Nori.

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You didn't know Nori's actually

278
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
really big on old school runescape,

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
so if you like the grind with the

280
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
grind while someone grinds,

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
everyone grind in live, then

282
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
definitely check out Nori as well

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
because she is grinding that

284
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
old school runescape.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If you're into ginger and stream,

286
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
check out Nori.

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If not,

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
you should still check out Nori.

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You never know.

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You never know.

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You may just, you may fanger.

292
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Kami oshi.

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Kami oshi de.

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh my God, I'm not.

295
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm not Min Maxon.

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Just got back from home.

297
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
How far away are we now?

298
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
6,000 wanes.

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Now, if my maths is correct,

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
in three hours time,

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I will officially

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
have the look of the drip

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
on this reflim.

304
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
See that drip?

305
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
See these shoulder pads?

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
See that red outline?

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
See the pot?

308
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Look at the little steam

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
coming off that pot.

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, oh, oh, he's hitting us

311
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
with the skillet.

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, oh, oh,

313
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that's right.

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He fucking flipped that T-bone.

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right.

316
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You show him how it is.

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, he put the freaking,

318
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
it's a meat pie.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's a meat pie.

320
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh my God.

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He just hit us with a meat pie.

322
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And we just got 98.

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, it's getting rised by a

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
reflim.

325
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Actually got rised so hard there.

326
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But we're at 98.

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The progress is nice.

328
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We need nai,

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
but a million XP,

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
which in theory is 6,000 wanes,

331
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I guess.

332
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Is that right?

333
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Is that the maths right?

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's so big.

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It is.

336
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Also,

337
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
another reflim

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
that's already done it.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And he's doing wanes

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
in solidarity with me.

341
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No, you cannot help me,

342
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
but thank you for your kindness.

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm beyond help.

344
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm beyond help.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh my God.

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Look at the hairstyle.

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The four, like,

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
four, like, little,

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't know what you called them,

350
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
a little too random.

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's it called on dinosaurs

352
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
when they have, like,

353
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
a little extra platelet

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
on the back of their head?

355
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's what that hairstyle

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
reminds me of,

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
but I'm sure

358
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
there's, like,

359
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
an actual thing.

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Still have

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
the

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
what in the little wane.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
5,000 equals a million?

364
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I can fix that.

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, I can.

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Only 69, 69 left.

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Wait, am I under?

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Am I under?

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Do I need more?

370
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
More, though?

371
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Or did I misunderstand the communication?

372
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Are you trolling?

373
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because I'll believe you.

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
69, 69 left.

375
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll believe you.

376
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll murder you.

377
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Are you telling the truth

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
that I misunderstand?

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Do I need more?

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm down under there, you.

381
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can make her worse.

382
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I believe the term is called scuttle.

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I made fan art

384
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
for the first time ever

385
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
by hand on you on Twitter.

386
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's not like,

387
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
oh my God, let's check it out.

388
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Did you at me?

389
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The Twitter notifications

390
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
are rubbish.

391
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I swear, if it's,

392
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
if it's the other,

393
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
if it's small fish,

394
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
not sure I can show it off.

395
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Hold on.

396
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Did you at me?

397
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't think you did,

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
because that's okay,

399
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
because you don't have to,

400
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
because I will look for it

401
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
myself manually.

402
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Small fish,

403
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and we'll look at stone art.

404
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh God, I need a min-max.

405
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Sorry.

406
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Escape.

407
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Combine.

408
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Space.

409
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Where's the small fish?

410
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't see it.

411
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait, what?

412
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What is this?

413
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No, it wasn't the AI one.

414
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is the AI one?

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I've just thought,

416
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I've just discovered

417
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
there's an AI one of me.

418
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
God damn,

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
how many folds does my kitschy got?

420
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Get that AI out of here.

421
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah,

422
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
if it was the AI one,

423
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
it actually does look like me.

424
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
AI gets scarily good.

425
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's like three folds

426
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
on the kitsch.

427
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm like, all right,

428
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
but I still got my hypnosis symbol.

429
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What the fuck?

430
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
AI is getting so good,

431
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
like scarily good.

432
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How did you tell it

433
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
to put the detail of my tape on?

434
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's crazy.

435
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's nice to see you.

436
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's nice to see you too.

437
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Get it?

438
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Because like the ocean and the sea.

439
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Okay, okay.

440
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And that was it.

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I need to give it a cheeky like.

442
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
As I said,

443
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't mind AI art.

444
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's not,

445
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
it's not really a big deal to me.

446
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If you want to put me in a wheelchair next to me,

447
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
because of my heart condition,

448
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
then by all means,

449
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
just understand that

450
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
AI art,

451
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I won't use in a schedule

452
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
or a YouTube thumbnail

453
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
for an ASMR role play,

454
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
for example,

455
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that's not me.

456
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't want to monetize it.

457
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
If you want to,

458
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't want to.

459
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I did it by hand and attitude.

460
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Wait,

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm strong.

462
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Bro, both of us,

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm in the mind chef looking from,

464
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
well,

465
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
you're in the mind chef

466
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
looking for diamonds.

467
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm in the mind chef.

468
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You know,

469
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
see, this is what I don't like about Twitter.

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It is so busted right now.

471
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I can't see a thing.

472
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can't see a single thing.

473
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No one is at me.

474
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I wonder,

475
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is your account new on Twitter?

476
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because it hides stuff.

477
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It makes it like impossible to find.

478
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't finish those lyrics.

479
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I've finished them enough, honestly.

480
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How is Min Maxson for 99 going?

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Considering we're 98,

482
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
we've fled.

483
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I think we're doing pretty dang good.

484
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm the diamond.

485
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Aww.

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Thank you.

487
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No,

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm the pearlescent.

489
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Even though there's not pearlescent,

490
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm pearlescent, okay.

491
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Nice journey, sorry.

492
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm like, no, don't be silly.

493
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You go to Guba.

494
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We just get in beachy.

495
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Right.

496
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Give me this fucking Twitter.

497
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I swear to God,

498
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
if it's just not anything.

499
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Good.

500
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why does that not show up?

501
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I see it.

502
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh my God.

503
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Wait, hold on.

504
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I need to make sure,

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I need to make sure I can show it on screen.

506
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay, hold on a minute.

507
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hold on a minute.

508
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We need,

509
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
hold on, I need Min Maxson.

510
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We're already at 6.2.

511
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We started on 6.8.

512
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Right, hold on.

513
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Where is she?

514
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This is safe to show on screen.

515
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hold on, let me put it on.

516
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Actually, maybe I should do that,

517
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
like a fan art.

518
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oops.

519
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's my PC.

520
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't worry.

521
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's my PC.

522
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's me.

523
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's me.

524
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That's not your PC.

525
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That was my PC.

526
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's having a hard time, okay.

527
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Are you ready?

528
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Boom.

529
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's me.

530
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh my God.

531
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Look, you can see my full model,

532
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
but you don't get to see my actual full model.

533
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm dead.

534
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Look at me and I got my tape.

535
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I got my spare.

536
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Oh wait, you can't see my mouse cursor.

537
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Dang it.

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't have anything to mouse cursor we're over with.

539
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Look, you got my yukata.

540
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You got my tape and you got everything.

541
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Thank you.

542
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah.

543
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I definitely need to go and show off all the fan art stream

544
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and I just get to like, oh my God.

545
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Even has the butt fangs.

546
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Honestly.

547
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I was going to make, so I can't believe it.

548
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Reflings.

549
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How far I've fallen.

550
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So obviously I want the girls to be as successful and popular.

551
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So me and AC have devised the plan.

552
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And on one day in this month, she's going to take my time slot.

553
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm going to take her time slot.

554
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm going to do a smart redirect into her.

555
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Because I want the most success for everyone.

556
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Me and AC came up with a plan.

557
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So devious.

558
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, it's so devious.

559
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
One stream I swapped my stream.

560
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's it.

561
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's literally the plan.

562
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But obviously when I retweet the girls and all that,

563
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I want them to be shown off as much as possible.

564
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So you don't have VTubers just screen cap themselves

565
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
for like five seconds doing something cute.

566
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I was going to be a cheeky sod and screen capture my thighs

567
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and be like, did you know that I had butt fangs

568
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
but you never see it?

569
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Because obviously you stream from the face up

570
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and nothing else.

571
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
A truly nefarious.

572
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What?

573
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Here's the plan.

574
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We get to be other girls more sometimes.

575
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Literally I'm like,

576
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Datel management for the clipper program

577
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to not clip me and focus on clipping the girls.

578
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Because I want the girls to succeed.

579
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I have everything I want right now and so much more.

580
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I have my reef flings.

581
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I have all the goofy plots we're going to do.

582
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I have all the audios that we're going to make together.

583
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Like I'm sending off the blue site information

584
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
to get that prepared.

585
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Because I would like to try one stream on it

586
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and see how it goes.

587
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And if we like it, we like it.

588
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If we don't like it, maybe it's going to...

589
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Definitely a once in a blue moon type thing.

590
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's not my...

591
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh my God.

592
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
A reef language is to trade with me.

593
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What are you going to offer me?

594
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It better not be a crusty sock.

595
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's a crusty sock, isn't it?

596
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Be honest.

597
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's a crusty sock.

598
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Be honest.

599
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm going to drink my tea.

600
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh, are you harvesting me?

601
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Because I'm a diamond?

602
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Because you're in the main shaft looking for diamonds?

603
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Oh, reef land.

604
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That's so sweet.

605
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I got a pickaxe.

606
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Thank you.

607
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Here you go.

608
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'll give you gloves in exchange.

609
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Let's trade.

610
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I had to accept trade.

611
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Fuck you.

612
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
We're trading again.

613
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You need to protect your hands when you touch the bean.

614
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay?

615
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because it's super sensitive.

616
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That's not even...

617
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I didn't even try and hide it.

618
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The diamond.

619
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Okay?

620
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The diamond sensitive to the touch.

621
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Put some gloves on.

622
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay?

623
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's too sensitive.

624
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You need...

625
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Here, take these.

626
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Take these.

627
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You need them.

628
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes, you need them.

629
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Take them.

630
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
There.

631
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Nice and secure.

632
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Nice and secure.

633
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay, let's...

634
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Let's get to...

635
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
We're already about to hit the 5K.

636
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That's funny.

637
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm in the same cave looking for...

638
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm gonna go spelunking.

639
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Literally, like, I'm so excited.

640
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I don't know if I said this.

641
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Empire inspired me to purchase a ice block maker for the freezer.

642
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And I literally have it right now.

643
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Here, listen.

644
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Listen.

645
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh, if I can reach it.

646
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Hold on.

647
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Okay, that was...

648
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That was my loop.

649
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Hear that?

650
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That is a silicon.

651
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Oh, it's just split apart.

652
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Wait, I did it.

653
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I got the silicon.

654
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Okay.

655
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So, some nefarious things are happening soon to you.

656
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I've got all the plans, all the things.

657
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I just need to cook.

658
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I have technically done one of the three major things that I need to do.

659
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Okay?

660
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
In the background.

661
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't have membership, but I don't need membership anymore.

662
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Because I didn't realise winemaking was free and all that jazz.

663
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So, I bought membership, but I didn't need it.

664
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But we'll definitely come back to RuneScape and do some missions together.

665
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Is the ice gonna be a thing?

666
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't know.

667
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Let's sign this.

668
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You need membership to claim this cape.

669
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, for fuck's sake!

670
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Are you serious?

671
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You can't claim the cape without paying membership?

672
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Is that real?

673
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh my god.

674
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Hook, line and sinker?

675
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What?

676
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Hook, line and sinker?

677
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I didn't know.

678
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It also costs 99 to buy.

679
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Okay.

680
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The good thing is I've got the moola thanks to the reeflings.

681
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Supplying me with like 20 million.

682
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We can give you the gold easy.

683
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I actually do have, I have 29 million gold.

684
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Did I earn a penny of that?

685
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Absolutely not.

686
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Do girl gamers have it easier?

687
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Well, the stream definitely sways the perception that yes, vitriol is a ripple.

688
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They got us over the barrel.

689
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I've been bamboozled.

690
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yeah, I didn't know that.

691
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
She's fixing a window with a silicone, clearly.

692
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I just need my cock on the window.

693
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
And then I get a spackle and spank it down.

694
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Wait, I'm getting treated.

695
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Hold on.

696
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I am shred, not to be confused with Shrek the hit TV series.

697
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What would you like to offer?

698
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What is this?

699
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's a necklace.

700
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What is it though?

701
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
This strength amulet?

702
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What do...

703
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Am I going to be supposed to walk?

704
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Bunk.

705
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Ooh.

706
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, it's a sword hindle thingy, my bobber.

707
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I've forgotten what they're called.

708
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Oh my god.

709
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Check the drip.

710
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Check the drip.

711
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Check it through the bank booth.

712
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Check the drip through the bank.

713
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Check.

714
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, there we go.

715
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Let's get a little...

716
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Let's get a little refling on the shoulder.

717
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Bonds are $14.6 million.

718
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Well, I have enough in-game currency to buy a bond,

719
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so I'm going to use my...

720
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Ooh, how did I...

721
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't know how I messed that up so successfully,

722
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
but I did, and that's okay.

723
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Are you a professional colt squeezer?

724
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You're just going to have to come over here and find that.

725
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, don't spend any real money if you can help her.

726
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I appreciate you, like, my very conscious of her,

727
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and I hate her.

728
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Just draw because what you find fun is fun, you know?

729
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Like, I...

730
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I can't draw.

731
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You should pop...

732
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You should check out my Gen 2,

733
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
draw Gen 2 suggestion streams.

734
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I have no drawing background.

735
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I was just goofing off.

736
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You know what?

737
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
You're not going to be Picasso off the bat.

738
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
People that...

739
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
You know, artists like Emmy, for example.

740
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Emmy didn't spawn out of the womb like that.

741
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You know, she's put years and years behind it.

742
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Don't kick yourself down.

743
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Pick yourself up type thing, you know?

744
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Don't be the one who's harsh to yourself.

745
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
You know, the world is already negative enough.

746
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Don't let yourself add to that.

747
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Don't continue the dog pile, okay?

748
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Lift yourself up.

749
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Be like, fuck yeah, I fucking did that.

750
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I actually put my mind to it and did it,

751
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because drawing is quite a big mental exercise.

752
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's not, you know, it's imaginative.

753
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's, you know, abstract concepts, all that kind of jazz.

754
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Like, it takes time.

755
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You're just spawning.

756
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You can draw anime by the age of four, you know?

757
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Is that cat day?

758
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Oh my God, I can't believe we don't have a neck or a beech ever.

759
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Remember that time when Veeler was doing marketing

760
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
that we purposely put A.C. when neck or ears is one of the outlines

761
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
so people thought...

762
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So people thought we had a necko.

763
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Ah, oh my God, I was literally getting dealt with

764
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
cloudfish in the forest, in Fangar forest.

765
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It was so fun.

766
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Sorry, scrawny, that I leaked the name of Gen 4.

767
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You know what?

768
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Discord kitten for Gen 4.

769
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
She has to be Belgian though.

770
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I need me a Belgian beech ever.

771
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I need her to be like, hello in German.

772
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And then she speaks a lot of French on the say,

773
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Bonjour, and then just the top off.

774
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Sprinkle of, you know, Flanders type chai, you know?

775
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I know we've got English on top.

776
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I need my Belgian kitten.

777
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Oh my God, I'm going to mum.

778
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, no, you can't say that out loud.

779
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
5,000, let's go.

780
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We're already on 5,000.

781
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Bro, steam rolling this.

782
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Steam rolling.

783
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I need a Falmer V-shrieber, absolutely.

784
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What if Jimmy came out with a giant paintbrush and an easel?

785
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Jimmy already did.

786
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Jimmy had a drunk stream and did that.

787
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Bonjour, Elclinc and your wagon.

788
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Every middle European language is trying to go into a Belgium asylum

789
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
looking for future V-tubers.

790
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You can't say that V-tubers are mentally unwell.

791
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What are you talking about?

792
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That is the core mechanic of being a V-tuber.

793
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Sorry, did you spawn in perfectly fine?

794
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Sorry, you're being denied your application.

795
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yep, you need to at least list three mental disorders

796
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
that you have experienced at any point in your life

797
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
before we will even take a look at your application.

798
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Don't waste our time and don't waste your time, okay?

799
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Let's just get into the nitty-gritty, okay?

800
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
You need a few things to go wrong in your life to be a V-tuber.

801
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I said what I said.

802
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And I stand by it, okay?

803
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
No, I'm healthy, it's all good.

804
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You got it, fishman.

805
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Gotta scuff them up a little bit.

806
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Come on, you need some real XP before you become a V-tuber.

807
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You gotta have some of that life experience, you know?

808
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I hear the story about you coming against the odds.

809
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Let's get down to business to become a virtual entertainer.

810
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Did you...

811
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I don't know, think it was gonna be easy.

812
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't know what I'm talking about.

813
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Awesome, ADHD, all makes sense.

814
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh, you need to combine them all.

815
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I mean, I did publicly say this, because Mercy...

816
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Before anyone said, you're not supposed to say it,

817
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Mercy said I'm allowed to tell the story.

818
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So I was going through Mercy's application.

819
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Everything looked absolutely gorgeous.

820
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm very happy.

821
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Her introduction, you know, introduced yourself video,

822
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
obviously that gives quite a high indication

823
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
of what a person is like,

824
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
because obviously they're putting their best foot forward.

825
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
So I'm reading, I'm reading, going through her application,

826
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
everything looks good.

827
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You know, she's already come clean and said,

828
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
look, I live with my family still.

829
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's a bit awkward to record, but I'll make it work.

830
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm like, yep, no, that's fine, you've been up front about it,

831
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I saw good.

832
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And then at the end of the application, it goes,

833
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
is there anything else you would like us to know?

834
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And she goes, I've got autism.

835
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I say, yep, you're in.

836
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I said, you're in.

837
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yep.

838
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You're in.

839
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yep.

840
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No questions asked.

841
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
No questions asked.

842
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And you come.

843
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Gotta look after.

844
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Gotta look after my fellow autism.

845
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Gotta give them a chance when anyone else does.

846
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And what did I get?

847
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Five beautiful daughters that are fantastic.

848
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
She understood that.

849
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Welcome to the clue.

850
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Tism Max and the lovely Tism girls, honestly.

851
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And you come.

852
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And you come.

853
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I say nothing.

854
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You're having a good time.

855
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
You're having a good time.

856
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Don't want to stop at all.

857
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But yeah.

858
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
No, the girls were absolutely hooting hollers

859
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
through the interview process.

860
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah, we've got a few things brewing.

861
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
A few things have been spoken into words to the girls.

862
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I do want to say, I got a marshmallow where someone was

863
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
misunderstanding, understanding my gen two jokes

864
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and my gen two donut on.

865
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Right.

866
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So let's, let's pause.

867
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Let's empty clear your mind.

868
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Okay.

869
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Let's empty our minds.

870
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So when I reference gen two, I just want to say this on the cards

871
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
right now when I mentioned gen two,

872
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,000
gen two is not coming in under a year.

873
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Okay.

874
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Of debut of gen one type thing.

875
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's just not a thing.

876
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Okay.

877
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The reason I am so open to talking about it is because

878
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
development takes an insane amount of time.

879
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.

880
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And my donut on goals are not personal goals.

881
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I've achieved everything I want.

882
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I've got my refland.

883
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm making the content for them.

884
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You know, I'm saying, you know, I'm saying.

885
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So when I talk about gen two and when I talk about my donut on

886
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
goals, I confirm the production of gen two.

887
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Again, reminder, gen two isn't happening anytime soon.

888
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
No.

889
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The reason I'm open to talking about it is because development

890
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
takes a very, very, very, very long time.

891
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It took me a full year of being pregnant with Azura,

892
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
AC, ME, Mercy and Sheebie to get here.

893
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Okay.

894
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It took a full year.

895
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Now, obviously when it's the first time you've ever done something

896
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
to that scale, things take time.

897
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hopefully it's a bit more streamlined this time.

898
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Okay.

899
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Wait.

900
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Who was the time?

901
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Also, who has the time to follow?

902
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Six more.

903
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It's not happening.

904
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's reasonable.

905
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You can give birth every nine months.

906
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Gen two and three hundred and six five plus one day.

907
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
No.

908
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Bruh.

909
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So when I say my donut on goals are related to gen two,

910
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
what I mean is that it's the confirmation of production

911
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
that we are publicly acknowledging and the models are getting ordered,

912
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
reference sheets ordered, logos ordered, loading screens ordered, music ordered.

913
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
That's what that means because it's not a thing right now.

914
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Lower video ordered, all of that.

915
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Everything takes a heck of amount of time.

916
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And you know, you, as in me and the development team are relying on all these commissioners

917
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
to deliver on time when they say they're going to do it type thing as well.

918
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That also plays a massive part.

919
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But yes, so please don't please don't panic and be like, oh my God,

920
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Strudy, Strudy's dropping gen one.

921
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
What the fuck?

922
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No.

923
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Like I tell you what it took me a year.

924
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
What?

925
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Stop it.

926
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
You're just making stuff up to upset me.

927
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Good morning, mummy and me.

928
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
If I ain't said herself.

929
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
If you didn't know I had a new ASMR collab role play up with Said,

930
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I finally got to do something for myself.

931
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Per Said.

932
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh my God.

933
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Right.

934
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Actually, just to advertise Said for one minute.

935
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Said is really good at whispering fast.

936
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Now, before you like, what do you mean by that?

937
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
What I mean is that Said may or may not produce a fast whispering ASMR role play.

938
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
If you're interested in that, please feel free to check out this video.

939
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I could not find your YouTube channel, but now that I've found it,

940
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I will update the description because I definitely use your old fucking channel name.

941
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So I do apologize about that.

942
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Actually, I need to add you on Discord.

943
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Why have I not added you on Discord?

944
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I will send you my yield on Twitter.

945
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Actually, you know what?

946
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Fuck it.

947
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm going to do it right now.

948
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Fuck you.

949
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That's right.

950
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's right.

951
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You're having to deal with me live stream and on Twitter.

952
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Get right.

953
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's okay.

954
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I call myself Edgy girlfriend.

955
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Okay.

956
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Okay.

957
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Okay.

958
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Yeah.

959
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Like I was like linking on a link to Twitter.

960
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
No, your Twitch page because I was like, oh my God.

961
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Wait.

962
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
We're just streamed there.

963
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'll have fucked that one up.

964
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But yes, there's the second collab up.

965
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So the next ASMR role play on my YouTube channel will be a 4,000 subscriber milestone.

966
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

967
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
But yes, I got to do an audio for myself.

968
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I did an audio collab for the girls.

969
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'll just finish it off and then I'm going to attempt the second one.

970
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And then that'll be two out of three things I had to do.

971
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Oh my God.

972
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
You're starting on me on this.

973
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm cute.

974
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah.

975
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You're cheating.

976
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Can we do rap?

977
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
God ASMR.

978
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I still kept me in.

979
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah.

980
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So Said sent me her lines.

981
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And my dumb ass was like, uh, who said, uh, not to be a bother, but, um, you've accidentally

982
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
sped up your lines.

983
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Do you want to know the embarrassing thing?

984
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Um, Said didn't speed up her lines.

985
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
She's just really good at articulating while whispering fast.

986
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And she re-recorded the line and I'm like, oh my God, I am mortified.

987
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I am so sorry to do that to you.

988
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
ASMR role play speed running.

989
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Well, I actually said to Said, I was like, a fast whisper in is a trigger.

990
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Like people love it.

991
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And for those who can participate in fast whispering like that, it's definitely a niche.

992
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So I said they're like, you might, you might want to jump on it.

993
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Honestly.

994
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Um, Said to actually be an M&M.

995
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Well, so obviously when I was editing it, so I'm like, and then I listened to Said's

996
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:07,000
and I'm like, oh no, she's forgotten to, um, she's forgotten to like less than it.

997
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
And I assumed you edited out your mistakes and just sent me whatever was left over to

998
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Said.

999
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
And I was like, oh no, she's, she's sped up by accident.

1000
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Nope.

1001
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Turns out Said, she's just really good at whispering fast.

1002
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So don't be, don't be shy.

1003
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
You might like the ASMR that comes from her channel.

1004
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay.

1005
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I listened to it.

1006
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Definitely sounded sped up.

1007
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
However, it was not.

1008
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Okay.

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I was so sorry, but that's absolutely right.

1010
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Um, she's starting to feel like a YAP God.

1011
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
YAP God.

1012
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Honestly.

1013
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Um, absolutely.

1014
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Um, but yes, that was one collab.

1015
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Uh, only like 17 more go to edit.

1016
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Actually, I will say one thing though.

1017
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I do apologize to Said and for Said and a, I have been sitting on those edits for quite

1018
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
some time.

1019
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,340
But all the other collab partners that agreed to collab with me, um, are struggling to find

1020
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,840
time to record.

1021
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:17,000
And I'm like, thank the fucking maker because I do not have time to do this right now.

1022
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,920
Um, Mercy, um, for snippets, I'm editing a Mercy Rokely.

1023
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,500
She fucking cooked.

1024
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,000
I sent her a really long script.

1025
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It wasn't my intention to make it a big script, but it ended up that way.

1026
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I think it's going to go down well.

1027
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So, um, I just need to cut my hair.

1028
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I was going to do it yesterday, but I got too tired.

1029
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Um, because I was up dealing with all this background stuff as always.

1030
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Um, I listened, uh, every ASMR is fast when you listen at 1.75 speed.

1031
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Can't wait.

1032
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Need my dose of Kohai.

1033
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
So anyway, when she asked for more collabs and she can reasonably edit.

1034
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The thing is, once I've cleared out the schedule, then I have all the time in the world.

1035
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And as I said, I've technically done one third.

1036
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I could technically be done two thirds by the end of today.

1037
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Um, which I'm like absolutely ecstatic about.

1038
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Um, at the thought of like just the mental relief of being like, oh my God, I can like

1039
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
fully dedicate myself to like editing for the girls type thing.

1040
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Um, now the third editor could do YouTube role plays and stuff.

1041
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But, I mean, I'm not opposed to it.

1042
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I suppose, like, so Mercy's newest ASMR role play, that was edited by me.

1043
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I fucking put all the sound effects that I bloody could.

1044
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I had her dropping her pen when you mentioned that, uh, you liked the teacher.

1045
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I had her scribbling on paper, moving her books.

1046
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Um, oh, sorry.

1047
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Uh, you know, I had the alarm bell go off the hallway, the walking steps, the, this or that.

1048
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Like, I really tried out my, the wazoo with them.

1049
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Um, all the time the world's strong is going to be a menace for his reef lens.

1050
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Well, that's the thing.

1051
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Like, I can kind of like swap back to my own stuff as well.

1052
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Like, I can catch up with the reef lens and catch up with my like little 100 VTuber thing.

1053
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I would really love to do the 100 VTuber collab in under a year.

1054
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay? In under a year.

1055
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Obviously, I'm behind in actual physical uploads.

1056
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:45,000
However, to people who have agreed to collab with me, if I do 10 a month,

1057
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I am well on my way to achieving that goal, you know?

1058
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Um, yeah.

1059
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Well, you give yourself a phase.

1060
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Give me, give me a number two all over chief.

1061
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Um, so many collabs.

1062
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I love it.

1063
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Mummy has all the endurance.

1064
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
What chance does reef lens have? None.

1065
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Absolutely nothing.

1066
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You have numbers.

1067
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Do you think that's enough to stop me?

1068
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Do you not remember?

1069
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
My new record is a minute 30, okay?

1070
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It's over.

1071
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Absolutely over.

1072
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Um, but yes, technically, to people who have agreed to interact with me on that level,

1073
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
when it comes to an ASMR collab, yes.

1074
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Um, I am aware that I give people very limited lines.

1075
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm going to be a cheeky shite.

1076
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Okay?

1077
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's just this stays between just us.

1078
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm going to be cheeky and I'm going to write longer ASMR collabs.

1079
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Now, I actually prefer this the way I do it, where it's like five minutes of talking

1080
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and then the rest is just these tingly, foley sounds that you can just tune out.

1081
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You don't need to think, you don't need to listen,

1082
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
especially for bedtime as well when you don't have to think about the tingles.

1083
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Very nice.

1084
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Um, I am going to be cheeky and try and do some more role play, some more collabs.

1085
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Now, they do take a bit more time to produce, especially script-wise,

1086
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
but I'm going to try and, you know, extend the talking time for a bit longer.

1087
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like the Denver, the Denver one was really sweet.

1088
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Um, I have a very nice collab with a VNU member in the works.

1089
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Um, she was very open and thankful and grateful.

1090
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You know, she was like, I don't want any good stuff.

1091
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And I said, no, no, no, I'm not like that.

1092
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I'm not like that.

1093
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You know, you don't need to worry.

1094
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
My, my reputation precedes me in that time.

1095
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I was like, no, no, no, no, no, it's fine.

1096
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's fine.

1097
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It's not like that.

1098
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It's okay.

1099
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
She's a quick shot.

1100
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
She'll even out.

1101
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Shawnee, the quickest shot in the way.

1102
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Are there any VTubers you specifically want to do a dream collab with?

1103
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Um, no.

1104
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I, I just adopt the model.

1105
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
If you want to fuck with me, I'll fuck with you type shit.

1106
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Um, there's not anyone in particular where I'm like, oh my god.

1107
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Uh, I'm, I'm just happy doing that.

1108
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Um, I find the story of the Denver collab rather unsettling.

1109
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So we introduced a symbiote to you in that roleplay.

1110
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
We're on 5.4.

1111
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
We're already down a thousand since starting.

1112
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I wanna, uh, we're strong.

1113
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The ASMR where you talk a lot are my favorite.

1114
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yes.

1115
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So I can obviously make myself talk, um, for as much as I want.

1116
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Like, as I said, I've actually got that community post.

1117
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
If you guys don't remember, I had a community post, um, on YouTube where I asked people

1118
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
to, you know, tell me what to say.

1119
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I was going to whisper it in the mic.

1120
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Um, I'm going to record that soon.

1121
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I just need to prepare all the screen shots.

1122
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Howdy.

1123
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Um, and, uh, I can record for an hour plus.

1124
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That's not a problem.

1125
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Asking a collab partner to record for an hour plus is outrageous.

1126
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Like that is entering money being offered collaboration type stuff.

1127
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So I try and reduce it to like the, it's a five minute recording experience because

1128
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:31,000
it's, uh, it's kind of hard to, yeah, it's, it's hard to ask for like full commitment

1129
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
because who gets the benefit of the club.

1130
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So yes, I'm the one writing it.

1131
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Yes.

1132
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm the one editing it.

1133
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yes.

1134
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm the one, um, who like has to put it together and, you know, sound effects, all that jazz.

1135
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Um, but who gets the most benefit?

1136
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Well, I do because it goes up on my channel.

1137
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I also get the money for it because I don't commission artwork.

1138
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I just use our VTuber models.

1139
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Now you could argue, well, you know, strongy, you're the, I don't know where my berries went

1140
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
where my berries.

1141
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Um, now you could argue, hey strongy, but you know, you're, you're at 20,000 subscribers,

1142
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
you know, it's kind of like the whole exposure thing for you exposure.

1143
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And the other person really only had to record for five minutes and that was it.

1144
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
They never had to do a singular thing else because I don't need sound effects.

1145
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I don't need this.

1146
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I don't need that.

1147
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I literally have everything myself.

1148
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I just need their voice and just need them to follow the script type thing.

1149
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Um, but I am the one ultimately who benefits the most out of it.

1150
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Um, you know, it doesn't matter what size they are.

1151
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's not really a factor.

1152
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Um, when it comes to collabs, it doesn't bother me.

1153
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I still haven't found my berries.

1154
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Um, they also get the benefit because you expose them to your members.

1155
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
The more speaking lines in the cool.

1156
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Yes.

1157
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Um, exposure is kind of pointless.

1158
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Anyway, now hold on a minute.

1159
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Who said that?

1160
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Hold on a minute exposure.

1161
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
What?

1162
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Exposure is why a emmer.

1163
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Wait, hold on.

1164
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
You know what?

1165
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I'm going to pull it.

1166
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
You know what?

1167
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm pulling up the clip.

1168
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Smoothie Emmy.

1169
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm typing in smoothie Emmy.

1170
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And if it doesn't, it didn't come up.

1171
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh my God.

1172
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Almost quarter of them.

1173
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I literally almost quarter of a million people have seen my little sister's chest.

1174
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm not going to make it.

1175
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm not going to make it.

1176
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm not going to make it.

1177
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Wait, did that lag out?

1178
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Wait, I just typed the link in the chat, but it didn't pull.

1179
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Huh.

1180
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That was strange.

1181
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Did that work?

1182
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Huh.

1183
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Okay.

1184
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
That worked.

1185
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
That was strange.

1186
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But yeah, that obviously boosted emmer's quite a bit.

1187
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And then that obviously led to the clipping program.

1188
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Oh my God.

1189
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
AC is live right now on Honeycam.

1190
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Oh, well, if you guys are not really being chilling on RuneScape, please don't worry.

1191
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
AC is literally on Honeycam Studio, which is a hilarious game.

1192
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I hope she's having fun on it because it's such a good for you.

1193
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Which reminds me, I need to send away a ton of shorts because you guys have been clipping.

1194
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
RuneScape at this time of day in this year, located entirely in Strony Stream.

1195
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Epic.

1196
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Exactly.

1197
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Um, we are humbly at 9 to 8.

1198
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Oh, wait, hold on.

1199
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I just realized normally I go over here.

1200
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Hi.

1201
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'm sitting on chat.

1202
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Hi chat.

1203
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Okay, normally I go here at RuneScape just because I don't want to cover up the...

1204
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Everything.

1205
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Hi, RuneScape.

1206
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Chat Tisker.

1207
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
My little RuneScape.

1208
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
But it's very kind of you to worry about their comfort level.

1209
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Maybe worth asking them exposure, maybe worth a ton.

1210
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
But the cost of 30 minutes is not that shabby.

1211
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I wouldn't go above the 10 minute recording mark.

1212
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I would never, I would never ask someone to record more than a thousand words.

1213
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But that's really pushing the upper limits of what I'm comfortable in asking someone.

1214
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Yes, they came to me and they were like,

1215
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Strony, give me a re-do.

1216
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I'll take whatever you throw at me.

1217
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I have a very long, this collab has been a year in the making, if you will.

1218
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I got reached out by an old acquaintance in another life.

1219
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And we initially had agreed upon this collab and she recognized my voice and she went,

1220
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
come on then.

1221
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And I went right, fuck it, let's do it.

1222
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So I've got an old acquaintance collab coming out which I'm very excited about.

1223
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
No, not a dwarf, not a dwarf, not a dwarf.

1224
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Before anyone starts, nope, not a dwarf, not a dwarf.

1225
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Just someone that I had associated with in another life and obviously she recognized the voice.

1226
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And I recognized her because I knew about her and we messaged, or she messaged me.

1227
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
She was like, do you remember?

1228
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And I'm like, of course I remember, you numpty.

1229
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I've still got the script.

1230
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I remember like four, yes.

1231
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So I think only one of them is going through.

1232
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I don't want to reach out to the other people out of respect that were confirmed just because

1233
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
if they don't interact with me now, I assume it's because of the agency.

1234
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Oh my god, the agency full of lude people.

1235
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Meanwhile, we're like fucking Min Max and Wines on...

1236
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
We're Min Max and Wines on Edgeville Bank, like come on, get a grip.

1237
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But yeah, I'm very excited.

1238
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It's nice to see people that I've not seen in a very long time and in a different form too.

1239
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
What level are we?

1240
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
We, my good re-fing, are 98.

1241
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We have less than a million X feet to go.

1242
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And we have almost just shy of 5,000 Wines.

1243
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Soon we'll be entering the 4,000 mark.

1244
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Man, you see what my runescape account looks like?

1245
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
You should sign in.

1246
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Come to Edgeville.

1247
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I'm on a free world.

1248
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
We're on 320, believe it.

1249
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
We're just chilling in Edgeville doing a little skill.

1250
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Making wine that's gonna move.

1251
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I understand nothing of that phrase.

1252
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
My brain won't sound strong and I don't worry about it.

1253
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
How about you, Min Max?

1254
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Explain.

1255
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
How about...

1256
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
How about...

1257
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Wait, I'm really bad at insults.

1258
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Hold on, let me think of an insult.

1259
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
How about you accept the fact that you're Diacel's Avon?

1260
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, how about that?

1261
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah.

1262
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yeah, you just sit on that one.

1263
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You just sit on that one, mate.

1264
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah.

1265
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
That's the best I got.

1266
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's the best I got, you're Diacel's Avon.

1267
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
They are...

1268
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
As sin likes to say,

1269
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
your nan's got nail arms, nail legs, and lips in a pillowcase.

1270
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What does it mean?

1271
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
We don't know.

1272
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
What?

1273
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah, but your mom's a slut.

1274
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
How dare you?

1275
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
When we get our MLM VTuber,

1276
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
most U.K. insults.

1277
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Okay, so in the U.K.,

1278
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
there's this makeup magazine, okay?

1279
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1280
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Thank you for becoming a member.

1281
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
What's that?

1282
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
How did you activate the sound alert when you did that?

1283
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I thought I didn't activate it.

1284
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Am I going mental?

1285
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Anyway, first off, thank you for coming a member.

1286
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I am going to be ordering the girls

1287
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
next round of emotes

1288
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
either in two days' time

1289
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
or today, depending on

1290
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
what goes on.

1291
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Acid in me first.

1292
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
The twins first, if you will.

1293
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
My lovely twins.

1294
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I do love my twins.

1295
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Are you squiddin' me?

1296
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Ah, bless the shimmy.

1297
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Okay, it does ping.

1298
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I thought it didn't make noise.

1299
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I think I might...

1300
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I just need to know.

1301
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
No, you cannot help me.

1302
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Thank you.

1303
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm beyond help.

1304
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Literally, 5.1K already.

1305
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Hydration check.

1306
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I was expecting brain.

1307
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Oh, like selling newspapers.

1308
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So, yeah, sorry.

1309
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Back to the Avon.

1310
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Avon is a magazine of makeup, okay?

1311
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And people come to your door

1312
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and are like,

1313
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
do you want to order off of this magazine?

1314
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It's the most bizarre system, okay?

1315
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But it's like...

1316
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's like a scam in terms of

1317
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
you pay astronomical prices

1318
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
because there's a middleman type thing.

1319
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
But you prey upon your friends and family

1320
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
and order through you.

1321
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Do you want to order?

1322
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You know what?

1323
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I've gone so far.

1324
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I've gone so far.

1325
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It's so long without saying that.

1326
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And you introduced brain rot back to me.

1327
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
How dare you?

1328
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Right, okay, actual hydration time.

1329
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Oh, it probably...

1330
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Basically, you know,

1331
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
your friends and family are getting preyed on by then,

1332
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
but what can I say except you're welcome

1333
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
for the sun to see the sky?

1334
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Hey, it's okay.

1335
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Okay, you're welcome.

1336
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Hi, mom, how are you, Flynn?

1337
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So it's like Tupperware?

1338
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
No, it's like makeup, like foundation, mascara.

1339
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Although they do have a few bits and bulbs.

1340
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And it's just...

1341
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
But basically, it's a bad job

1342
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
in terms of, you know,

1343
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
at the end of the day,

1344
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
there's a markup for something

1345
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
that someone could go do themselves.

1346
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And really, it's old biddies

1347
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
that can't go to the shops

1348
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
or can't get out that much

1349
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
or didn't know how internet shopping works type thing.

1350
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
But internet shopping kind of killed the job

1351
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
if you would like to refer to it in that terminology.

1352
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Now, don't get me wrong.

1353
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm not dogging on the job.

1354
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I'm dogging on what it is.

1355
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You know, I don't care what you do.

1356
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I used to clean toilets for a living.

1357
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I used to be a dishwasher.

1358
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I used to fucking wipe ass for a living.

1359
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I couldn't give less of a shit what your job role is.

1360
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Sure, I've already been there and done that, okay?

1361
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I do not judge the job.

1362
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
What I judge is what the job actually is

1363
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
if, you know, the end game is like, you know, bad.

1364
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Tupperware, the company,

1365
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
has the same business model in the US.

1366
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Oh!

1367
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
There's a company called Tupperware.

1368
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Okay.

1369
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Stroney is a hard worker.

1370
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Now, the dishwashing job, honestly...

1371
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Honestly, the dishwashing job was good.

1372
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Waitress was Polgar's.

1373
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Working in the care home was rough.

1374
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I used to be an outdoor painter

1375
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
because I never got qualified for, like, interior.

1376
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
So I could only do sheds and fences, really.

1377
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
That was a bit short-lived, though.

1378
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I have to admit.

1379
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
The painting was rough as I did.

1380
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It was so sore on your, like, shoulder and all of that.

1381
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Should have been easy with ten arms, if only.

1382
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
If only.

1383
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Waitress, Stroney.

1384
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Oh, you want to make it artwork of me as a waitress?

1385
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Yeah.

1386
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
You want to see an apron

1387
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
really accentuate my hips even more

1388
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
and then when I look away?

1389
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
When I, like, turn around, it's just my...

1390
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Did I tell you I got covered in milk at my job?

1391
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Um...

1392
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I got milk knocked all over me,

1393
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
and I had to continue my shift

1394
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
in soaked milk.

1395
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Rather disgusting, in all honesty.

1396
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I had gone.

1397
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
No, it was the...

1398
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
That was an accident.

1399
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, 4,000!

1400
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It was just one big, like, accident.

1401
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Guy didn't, you know.

1402
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
He was telling a story,

1403
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and he opened his arms wide,

1404
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
just as I was walking past,

1405
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
but the fucking wingspan on him

1406
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
clipped me and I knocked milk all over my shirt.

1407
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
So...

1408
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I had to...

1409
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I think I had another, like, four hours of my shift to go,

1410
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
and I learned the hard way

1411
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
to bring an extra...

1412
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
change of clothes...

1413
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
when I work after that.

1414
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It was a white shirt.

1415
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
No, thankfully.

1416
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It was a black shirt.

1417
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
So it didn't become see-through,

1418
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
but...

1419
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I wear...

1420
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
flattening bras, I guess,

1421
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
in terms of, like, I'm really flat.

1422
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So it did not...

1423
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
It's not like anything would have shown anyway.

1424
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And all that.

1425
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I probably didn't have my piercings either at the time,

1426
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
so it's not like it would stick out.

1427
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Yeah.

1428
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
A bralette.

1429
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Honestly, trainer bra might as well.

1430
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I don't know who I'm kidding.

1431
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I don't know who I'm kidding.

1432
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Waitress Johnny as an architect

1433
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
must have been a minute.

1434
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
No!

1435
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
No, I...

1436
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I couldn't...

1437
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
even though, like, I really enjoy the...

1438
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
the special interest of...

1439
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
How many of you fuckers have fucking cooking caves,

1440
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
you little shit?

1441
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Are there four of you now?

1442
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
God damn.

1443
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
All these are cooking steaks.

1444
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Why do you need a bra if nothing...

1445
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
to hold?

1446
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Right.

1447
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Well, I tell you an actual factual thing.

1448
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
So who here has heard

1449
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
that if a woman does not wear a bra,

1450
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
that her goobers get bigger in size?

1451
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Who has heard this little saying?

1452
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I wonder.

1453
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I have curiosity if you have heard such a thing before.

1454
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
We're just to MLG Pro at this game clearly.

1455
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Is that a fact?

1456
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Nope, you've never heard of it.

1457
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Is it real?

1458
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Nope, isn't it real?

1459
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Oh, you've never heard...

1460
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Oh, okay, I guess it must be a woman thing then.

1461
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Okay, so there is a saying that

1462
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
if you do not wear a bra,

1463
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
that your goobers get bigger, okay?

1464
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The reason why your goobers get bigger

1465
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
is because they start sagging, mother fucker.

1466
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
See, mine, I have always worn

1467
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
a very tight fitting bra, okay?

1468
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
This has resulted in...

1469
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
and also I don't have any jeans to have milk or somehow,

1470
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
even though my mom's like a quadruple fucking eff or something.

1471
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
My mom's got the biggest fucking honkers ever,

1472
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
and I'm flat-chested.

1473
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Where did it all go wrong, Refunds?

1474
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Where did it all go wrong?

1475
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah, it doesn't work like that.

1476
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,000
No, but because I have always been strapped with a bra,

1477
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
my honkers are like...

1478
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
you know, they didn't, I think.

1479
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Oh, the genetics does play into it.

1480
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
There is like genetics that play into it as well,

1481
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
but because I had nothing to begin with,

1482
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
there's no gravity at all.

1483
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
You know what I mean?

1484
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You just have fake eff cups.

1485
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I just went to your butt.

1486
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Honestly, true, Andrea.

1487
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
My butt, my thingy.

1488
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm wanting to start being a bit more shapely

1489
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
in terms of like going for walks

1490
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
or like doing low workouts and stuff,

1491
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
because I want a fat ass to suffocate you with.

1492
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I'm not even kidding, I'm not even...

1493
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Small chest is pretty good though.

1494
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Unrelated, but did you have a uniform in your waitress job?

1495
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
No, we just had to put wee pennies on.

1496
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It's like the wee thing that goes around your hip

1497
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
and I actually accidentally stole it once by accident.

1498
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I was like, I had to take it from my boss.

1499
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I was like, I see, I stole it.

1500
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Because a smaller chest means we can be closer to your heart.

1501
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Yeah, you can also hear the clacking of my rib cage

1502
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
because there's nothing else going on there.

1503
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I'm really pushing the mood for a nice little sleep scene.

1504
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
4.8 already, we're getting this again.

1505
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Stress-free, strong, also getting fit.

1506
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
No matter if everything's good, hold the line.

1507
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Literally, I'm like, oh my god, I feel better.

1508
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I want to start going on my walks again.

1509
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I want to start doing my weighted workouts

1510
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
because I've got weights for my legs.

1511
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Well, no, sorry, my apologies.

1512
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That's not how it's explained.

1513
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Is it done, Bells, that you lift for your arms?

1514
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Basically, I do weighted workouts for my legs with those

1515
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
so I will do lunges with them at either side

1516
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
so my legs are getting more activated type of thing.

1517
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I used to do that.

1518
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
All this kind of stuff.

1519
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Because the stress be going, I'm like, oh my god,

1520
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I want to do this, I want to do that.

1521
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I want to have this for my refunds.

1522
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Don't skip arm day.

1523
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I never do my arms.

1524
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I always just, I just max on my legs.

1525
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I like my legs the most.

1526
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah, dumb Bells.

1527
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Like these, but one-handed.

1528
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1529
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Oh my god, explain things to me in emojis.

1530
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I'll get it instantly.

1531
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Strani, do you think you could crush a watermelon with your thighs?

1532
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Should we try?

1533
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I think we should.

1534
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Do a donut thong stream?

1535
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Wait a minute, why do it for a donut thong

1536
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
if I'm doing a thigh cam stream, like, literally in how many days?

1537
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I might go to the shops and get a watermelon.

1538
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
But what happens if I can't do it?

1539
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
That's embarrassing.

1540
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I've not worked out since debut.

1541
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Hmm, that's embarrassing.

1542
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I'm a guy, I'm pretty skinny, but all my fat goes to my thighs.

1543
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Weight distribution on men and women is different to you.

1544
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Guys get a go-out, which is really cute.

1545
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I like it.

1546
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Whereas women is like, it gets spread around the body

1547
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,000
in preparation for pregnancy.

1548
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
You can try, I've seen clips, but no, it seems very difficult.

1549
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Then put a print of a refill on it.

1550
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Use a banana instead.

1551
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You want me to squeeze a banana with my thighs?

1552
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I mean, I'm not going to argue if that's what you want.

1553
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Look, you're in control of the content here.

1554
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
What do you mean you didn't want to pick another forever session of RuneScape?

1555
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Shut up and enjoy the gameplay, okay?

1556
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Look at the, look at the tick, tick, tick, tick.

1557
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Come on.

1558
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Squeeze a cherry, that would be quite messy.

1559
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah, fat distribution.

1560
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Buy two so you can test it.

1561
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I don't think you, I'm not entirely sure how to even crush anything between my legs.

1562
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I mean, could give it a shot.

1563
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Give it a shot, why not?

1564
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Because I could definitely like lie on the floor and try,

1565
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
imagine the grip strength that mummy would have on multiple areas, the gameplay.

1566
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It sounds like a little banana cream.

1567
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Buying a bunch of fruit to try and see if you can crush them.

1568
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Honestly, that would probably be more interesting than just like thigh cupping ASMR stream.

1569
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Cause, I don't know, I'm like, I'm not boring in terms of that.

1570
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I'm just like, I can't really make it more exciting than, you know, just two hours of my thighs being in the camera.

1571
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
But I mean, then again, if people like it, who am I to argue?

1572
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Gee, I ain't arguing.

1573
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
But yeah, maybe I should.

1574
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I'll buy a bunch of different fruit, fruit crushing ASMR stream.

1575
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
My tent.

1576
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Oh my god, you got a little pet.

1577
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Oh my god, look at the pet.

1578
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Show me the reflin one.

1579
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Is that the reflin one there?

1580
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
See it?

1581
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
That's like a little thing.

1582
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Rainscape yak session is exactly what I signed up for.

1583
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Oh boy, you're in luck.

1584
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
You're a cute one.

1585
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Do you like squeaky toy?

1586
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Just plan ahead if you want to crush fruit, I could imagine it gets messy.

1587
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Yeah, I was basically just going to put a bunch of towels on the floor.

1588
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
That's the best I got.

1589
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Although I'm in a rental so I need to behave.

1590
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Last thing you want is like rotten fruit smell on the carpet.

1591
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
That's amazing.

1592
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But I couldn't get like that plastic stuff because that wouldn't be ASMR.

1593
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I'm so glad I found that clip of y'all.

1594
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Is that the smoothie that I swear?

1595
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
So many people found us from smoothie.

1596
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
A what?

1597
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I'm like what?

1598
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
What?

1599
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Is this?

1600
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Are you American?

1601
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Be honest right now, tiny spiny.

1602
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But I will instead be crushing you, crushing a dana mall.

1603
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Who's dana mall and why does he have a cup?

1604
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
What is this?

1605
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
What is a dana mall?

1606
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Is this a reference?

1607
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Is it an American reference?

1608
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It's basically yogurt and a cup.

1609
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
The crush, what?

1610
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Crush cup advertising.

1611
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Who you on about?

1612
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Hold on, we're maxing, we're maxing checks.

1613
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh my god, smooth and crunchy.

1614
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Oh my god, I know that meme.

1615
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
It's the one where it's like smooth and crunchy.

1616
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
So what does the animals' crunches feel like in your mouth?

1617
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Why is this right?

1618
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
It's a crunchy.

1619
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
This is the perfect brain roll for me.

1620
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's both smooth and crunchy.

1621
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That's not even what I was referencing.

1622
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
We'll get rekt because I referenced it.

1623
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Oh guys, it's both smooth and crunchy.

1624
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And then a random monkey comes on the screen.

1625
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Why?

1626
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Okay, but yeah, basically, right, fuck it.

1627
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
We're gonna be crushing fruit on that ASMR stream.

1628
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Her zoomer brain rolls to advance.

1629
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Me, Gibberish, I, Melan, basically.

1630
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Reethlings only see mummy after missing her for five minutes.

1631
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Is that how you guys cry?

1632
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I always thought you cried like, would you clap on camera?

1633
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I would have to stand up for it.

1634
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
The webcam's gonna be facing downwards

1635
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,000
because I have to attach it to a mic stand

1636
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
in order for it not to move.

1637
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But I could go off a screen and clap if you want.

1638
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
We'd cry like, well, that's what I thought.

1639
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It was kind of like, you know.

1640
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Can we see the shadow of the tree?

1641
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I don't know if the light and the source are,

1642
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
because the light's at the top,

1643
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
and then I have a ring light on the right side

1644
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
just so my face is a bit better.

1645
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Eliminated, but I'd be true about the tree.

1646
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Yeah, I'll see, I'll see, I'll see.

1647
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I'm gonna do a full body stream at one point.

1648
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Relax! Let me finish the sentence.

1649
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Let me finish the sentence

1650
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
before you start taping fingers off the key!

1651
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
For one of my Donathon goals,

1652
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I want to do a full tactical dress-up.

1653
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
But the thing with the full tactical dress-up

1654
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
is you put like the black marker on your eye area

1655
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
so you can't see anything, okay?

1656
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So I'm not ruining the illusion

1657
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
because you can't see anything on the face.

1658
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I also want to do a Rebecca neck down stream,

1659
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
so I'ma paint myself fucking blue at one point.

1660
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So as always, you know, if you're like someone

1661
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
that doesn't really like that stuff being broken,

1662
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
then please feel free to check out my gen mates,

1663
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
because I am blackface.

1664
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
No, motherfucker.

1665
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's combat tactical shite, you put on your eyes.

1666
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
She's transforming into Slenderman?

1667
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Absolutely not.

1668
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Not with his elongated arms.

1669
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
What do you think?

1670
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Mummy as Rebecca would be hot.

1671
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I so badly want to cosplay as Rebecca.

1672
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
But Rebecca is red after being...

1673
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You know what?

1674
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
You know what?

1675
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Will you be blinded?

1676
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Oh my god, wait!

1677
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I never even thought

1678
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
would V-Trip Studio be able to...

1679
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
No, I can see my eyeballs.

1680
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm sure V-Trip Studio can see my eyeballs.

1681
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
But I may...

1682
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Oh no, I'm worn,

1683
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
because my entire face is going to be covered

1684
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
in tactical gear.

1685
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Oh, I never thought that far ahead.

1686
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Did I now?

1687
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Hold on a minute.

1688
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Oh no.

1689
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Oh no, this can't be.

1690
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I never thought that far ahead.

1691
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Chaisa.

1692
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Good va...

1693
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Yeah.

1694
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Blah.

1695
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Oh, what the fuck was that?

1696
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Did I just eat?

1697
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
No.

1698
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
What was that?

1699
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Did you see the...

1700
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
What's a booze at that point?

1701
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I'm too smart,

1702
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
even if you simply misrhythmize it.

1703
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
PNJTuber.

1704
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Stronifying new possibilities.

1705
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Try it all stream.

1706
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I didn't know you liked military gear.

1707
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I like the...

1708
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
What have I done?

1709
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Okay.

1710
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Oh my god, I've done sautin'.

1711
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I've done...

1712
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I've...

1713
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Yep.

1714
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Hold on.

1715
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
No, don't log out.

1716
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Shit.

1717
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Okay.

1718
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Law...

1719
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Hold on.

1720
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
What have I done?

1721
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Okay.

1722
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Can I go to the bank, boo?

1723
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Have I fixed it?

1724
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Press alt.

1725
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Okay.

1726
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Okay, thank you.

1727
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Holy shit.

1728
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
That...

1729
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

1730
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
We got stun locked.

1731
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
We literally got soft locked in the game there.

1732
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Because of my stupidity.

1733
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Please understand, small brain.

1734
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Strongly, that stream Bravo 6 is going dark.

1735
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Fatass and no boo boo,

1736
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Rebecca Cosplay for sure.

1737
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Real and true.

1738
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Why do you say Shaisa all the time?

1739
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I just like swearing in different languages.

1740
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I said what I said, okay?

1741
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I said what I said.

1742
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
A little cheeky sucabliette here.

1743
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
A little bordello here.

1744
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
What else?

1745
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
A little cazzo.

1746
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Cazzo merda.

1747
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Puta madre.

1748
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
What else do I know?

1749
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Bef.

1750
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
What's French?

1751
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Merd.

1752
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Merd.

1753
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Merd.

1754
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Do I know swearing in any other languages?

1755
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I don't think so.

1756
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
I think that's pretty much it.

1757
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Cazzo merda.

1758
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Puta.

1759
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Oh, puta.

1760
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Okay, how could I forget?

1761
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
How could I forget the Viva la France?

1762
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Can you call us horrible things, please?

1763
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
In English?

1764
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Are you secretly one of those tactical Cosplay girls

1765
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
that I keep seeing on my Twitter homepage?

1766
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I actually caught in 40.

1767
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Everyone thinks that I'm busy

1768
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
with all those behind-the-scenes work.

1769
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I'm thoughtin' about in them tactical,

1770
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
red ears.

1771
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Puta.

1772
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Not putin'.

1773
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Cazzo.

1774
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
If you want to know what Son of a...

1775
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
is in her...

1776
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
for guys...

1777
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Her...

1778
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Oh, Hurrenzon.

1779
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I've been told Hurrenzon, you know.

1780
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Yeah.

1781
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Beep.

1782
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Ha ha.

1783
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Ik ben slim.

1784
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I don't know how to say I know.

1785
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Ik ken dat?

1786
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Ik ken dat?

1787
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I know that.

1788
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I think it's Dutch.

1789
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Just say I know that in Dutch.

1790
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Ik ken dat?

1791
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
No, did I just make that up?

1792
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I mean, I just made that up.

1793
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Sorry, Xie.

1794
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Isn't it puta?

1795
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I just love to...

1796
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I just love to fuck while wearing a ghillie, honestly.

1797
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Do you remember that fucking...

1798
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Was it Modern Warfare 2 map where people...

1799
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
No, it was called 4.

1800
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Oh my god, I was literally a baby on that game,

1801
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and I remember someone was shootin' at me

1802
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
from under the map, and I think it's so annoying.

1803
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Ik ken dat?

1804
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I know that.

1805
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
With your accent, you could go through as a German.

1806
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Hallo, Leiter.

1807
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Wait, what's the Scottish accent on German?

1808
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Hallo, Leiter.

1809
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Wie geht's gut und dir?

1810
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Dainenmutter is in Schweinhand.

1811
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Das is gut, ja.

1812
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Is das Gras road?

1813
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Nein, das Gras is groin.

1814
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Ja, ja, that's...

1815
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
German.

1816
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Scots is not happening anytime soon.

1817
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I am not poppin' up on Duolingo.

1818
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Okay, this feels so...

1819
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
That was fowl.

1820
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Ja, nein.

1821
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Das was...

1822
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Ja, da.

1823
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
East Liebes fans.

1824
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Ja, ja.

1825
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Yes, I guess, I guess.

1826
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
That's a Dutch fireman on the floor.

1827
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I don't know what Scottish Dutch would sound like.

1828
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Hallo, ich ben Sturoni-Cuttles.

1829
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Ich wohne in Schotland.

1830
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Ich bin...

1831
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Ich heb...

1832
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Oh my god, JÃ¼ngen becomes JÃ¼ngen in Scottish Dutch.

1833
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
What about French?

1834
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Bonjour, c'est la vie.

1835
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Je m'appelle Sturoni-Cuttles.

1836
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
J'ai a beat, oh, et cos.

1837
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
J'ai...

1838
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
J'ai jouÃ©...

1839
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
J'ai jouÃ©...

1840
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Runescape.

1841
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah, that's just...

1842
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
That's absolutely awful.

1843
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Let's not do that.

1844
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Please, someone cut that's awful.

1845
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
If you want to know the German equivalent of Slag is...

1846
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Schlum.

1847
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Dain and Mutter is in Schlump.

1848
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Pee.

1849
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Schlump.

1850
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
She's so good.

1851
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
German is a bit similar to Swedish.

1852
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You just have to sound German and talk aggressively.

1853
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Hallo, leurophasket.

1854
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Du bist kutscha.

1855
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I don't know.

1856
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Volkswagen.

1857
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
The Krankenmobil.

1858
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's the...

1859
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That's because I've tried desperately to scramble for one more thing.

1860
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
What is Dain and Mutter?

1861
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It's your mum.

1862
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Dain and Mutter in German, your mum.

1863
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So, to say your mum is a pig in German,

1864
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
we say Dain and Mutter, your mum,

1865
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
is a Schweinhound, is a pig.

1866
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
This is a Flamenwaffe.

1867
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Hans gets the Flamenwaffe.

1868
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Isn't Dain and Mutter that game with the pink board?

1869
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
What?

1870
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
This is a video game reference.

1871
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I don't know.

1872
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Tristan Schreiner.

1873
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
World Domination Gumpalger's Champuses.

1874
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I've planned out my next hypno stream.

1875
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So, I'm going to do a hypno stream live

1876
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
where I get you to forget your name

1877
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
and you become a reflin.

1878
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
However, I'm also going to make it a separate video.

1879
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I will change it up a bit,

1880
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
but my next hypno stream is going to be Forget Your Name.

1881
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And I may or may not want you to drill a little bit on yourself,

1882
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
but that's just for me and my side.

1883
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Because I think it'll be really cute if you drill on yourself.

1884
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But that's just me.

1885
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
And it makes me...

1886
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Yeah, that's a lot, so...

1887
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Look, I snotty.

1888
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I'm bad for it.

1889
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But I'm a reflin already.

1890
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
No, you have to forget your name.

1891
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I'm going to train you to not respond to your actual name.

1892
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And you become a reflin.

1893
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Making you drill when mommy angst.

1894
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Bummy angst when you drill.

1895
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I just think it's really hot.

1896
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I said it.

1897
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
It's like sizzling like a sirloin steak in a skillet hole.

1898
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
The game with pink blood is Danganronpa.

1899
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I keep hearing about that game.

1900
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I'm going to start playing it in a minute.

1901
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'll hear about it all the time.

1902
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
That's like the third time in a week that it's been brought up.

1903
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Is that a massive series?

1904
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I think you guys said it was a VN though.

1905
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Me, Send and Mercy, play it first.

1906
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,000
See if she likes it or not, and then I'll play it.

1907
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
It's a mystery series game.

1908
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Don't? Oh, someone just strapped it and said don't.

1909
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I just like the idea that you're so in a spell that you're legit drilling

1910
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
and you don't know until you're on the other end.

1911
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I can do it with an Asian accent.

1912
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I'm part Asian.

1913
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I ain't saying that out loud.

1914
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah, VN is a pretty popular one.

1915
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Danganronpa is a crime visual novel.

1916
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I can make myself drill by napping in the day while listening to ASMR.

1917
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I wish it could be fulfilled.

1918
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
We're already hypnotized by your charm.

1919
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You want complete control of us.

1920
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Is that so much to ask for?

1921
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Maybe I don't want to destroy all of humanity.

1922
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Maybe I just want my wiflings and I to have a very good thing.

1923
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Some Swedish lore.

1924
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Just want to enslave it.

1925
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Saliva is the top five.

1926
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Why are you drinking emote to that?

1927
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Actually, I don't need to hydrate though.

1928
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Oh my God, we're at 4.1.

1929
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Hydration check.

1930
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Hypnotize me, mommy.

1931
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Soon.

1932
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Make it top two.

1933
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Okay.

1934
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Right.

1935
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Make it top two.

1936
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Wait, what's number one?

1937
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
My anchor, yours.

1938
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Mommy, cute mommy.

1939
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Why are you crying over mommy?

1940
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Take control of me, mommy.

1941
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Don't forget to click her for mommy training.

1942
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Bear.

1943
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I'm waiting on my freaking collar to come.

1944
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:36,000
So I can put it on and take cute pictures.

1945
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Don't need to destroy humanity when you can just destroy our mains.

1946
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Real and true, okay?

1947
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Real and true.

1948
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Hold on, let me open up marshmallows.

1949
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah, it's little pen.

1950
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Little penny for bone prostate health.

1951
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
See that? Look, first thing open up

1952
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
and we're all looking after each other's paw.

1953
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Can I put my mom on?

1954
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Finished watching the void.

1955
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
My favorite parts were wreathlings, you can burp.

1956
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Darling, ten out of ten.

1957
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Ten out of ten, my wreathlings can burp.

1958
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Sleepy wreathlings, collabs feel more comfortable for you now.

1959
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
What are you analizing? You've just thrown me into this.

1960
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
I'm glad I say stream workers going well now that you're motivated.

1961
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Also, no, I hate the vocal fry.

1962
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
What are you talking about?

1963
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
What? You don't like my vocal fry?

1964
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
What's wrong?

1965
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
You don't want to listen to a beach uber with a vocal fry.

1966
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
What's wrong? You don't like this?

1967
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
It sounds like I have those devices.

1968
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You don't like that?

1969
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Could you imagine?

1970
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Cute wreathling with crown being your kingling.

1971
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
All the meme references in the game, the dirty boy voice acting part.

1972
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
The brat from misunderstand and the destruction.

1973
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
By the way, Strony, you never mentioned what happened to your work after stream.

1974
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Look, all I'm going to see.

1975
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:24,000
My ability to polish the pair of lessons has returned, okay?

1976
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And I'm going to take it out on all of you.

1977
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Do you understand?

1978
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Mark my words. I am taking it out on all of you.

1979
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I think I've got maybe two more days of work.

1980
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,000
If I manage to pull it out in years.

1981
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Hold the line. Don't threaten me with a good time.

1982
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I understand. We may have volunteered.

1983
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
We're so back. Looking forward to it.

1984
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
We're finished.

1985
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Don't look at old words for chocolate.

1986
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Olivia, something racist.

1987
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Oh no, don't do that. Please don't stop.

1988
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
To Valhalla, honestly.

1989
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's cute that in your new life you can unleash your inner true zimmer.

1990
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Isn't it really bad this time around?

1991
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I definitely held myself back in another life.

1992
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I was like...

1993
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But now I'm just like, yep, this is me.

1994
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
And you have to tolerance that.

1995
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Another thing, the art you posted recently.

1996
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
My ink sac hurt again.

1997
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Holding back is hard.

1998
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Are you waiting?

1999
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Are you waiting for the picture?

2000
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Can you imagine it now?

2001
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
What kind of poses I'm going to be in?

2002
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
My tripod is quivering with anticipation.

2003
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,000
The coconut oil bottle is quivering with anticipation.

2004
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I'm watching the anagings I'm going to be getting up to.

2005
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,000
It's the moment we've all been waiting on to be two months.

2006
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
That's how long it took me.

2007
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I expect to be completely destroyed.

2008
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
If you say it like that, we'll be...

2009
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So say stuff like that, what do you mean?

2010
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's not a threat, it's a promise.

2011
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Wait, no, other way around.

2012
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It's not a promise, wait.

2013
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
You know what I'm saying, I'm trying to say.

2014
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Not just the tripod and the oil.

2015
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I'm going to try body writing.

2016
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I have markers and I'm going to try and write stuff on it.

2017
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And be like, I'm going to try and do different things.

2018
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
So it's like, one's like I'm Riefling's property.

2019
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Like only for Riefling type thing.

2020
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Like Riefling's tongue here.

2021
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And like derogatory and that kind of stuff.

2022
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I'm going to see what happens.

2023
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
It's not very easy to write on myself.

2024
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I'm literally going to have to be like lifting my leg behind my head

2025
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
in order to write on myself.

2026
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
So I'll be very curious to see how it comes out.

2027
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
The thigh cam, stream sense.

2028
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
She's marking us, oh dear.

2029
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Right too small.

2030
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Well, I can wipe off.

2031
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
It's not like...

2032
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I can wipe off.

2033
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's just really difficult.

2034
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
So if my like pale pasty skin doesn't look pasty and pale

2035
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
it's because I've messed up so many times trying to take it off

2036
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
and put it back on again.

2037
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Because I was going to do loads of different variations of it.

2038
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
You're certainly something.

2039
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I hope you know that.

2040
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Thanks is the autism.

2041
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
It's the...

2042
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I don't even know.

2043
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I mean it's just the wombo combo of them both.

2044
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
But yeah.

2045
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I'm going to see if I can do a little turkey gift as well.

2046
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I think that would be cute.

2047
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And I'm going to put a big two on one cheek

2048
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
and then a big zero on the other.

2049
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And then see if I can get a little torque gift for that.

2050
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I thought that would be cute.

2051
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Just don't wipe off your hard work when adding the oil.

2052
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Well, that's the thing.

2053
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I would have to do the oil last.

2054
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,000
So basically is do the stuff without anything on me.

2055
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Then do the right end.

2056
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:18,000
And then once I'm satisfied, completely take off all the right end.

2057
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,000
But obviously my skin is going to be stained black at that point.

2058
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And then do the oil stuff that I want to do.

2059
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And then I think that'll be it.

2060
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I'll kind of have to look over.

2061
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You're wonderful just the way you are.

2062
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Thanks.

2063
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I came out like this.

2064
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Never change.

2065
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And so you didn't jump around a pole and sing mid-summer.

2066
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
You're untrue.

2067
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
This is too much excitement.

2068
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I like doing stuff that you guys actually want.

2069
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Because it's like, well, you want it.

2070
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I'm not just like taking a stab in the dark.

2071
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I was like, no, you guys, if you want it, you get in it.

2072
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Sorry, I keep this.

2073
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I don't know if you can see it down here.

2074
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
This space is getting bigger and bigger next to skullfish.

2075
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It's just getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

2076
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Because I keep trying to think of the anticipation of crazy.

2077
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Your latest NSF tweet with the art attached to skullfish.

2078
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Oh, you liked it.

2079
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I'm glad.

2080
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Okay, well, Stony, I want you to sit on my face.

2081
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
The only time I can do that is the convention.

2082
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I can't wait to be kicked out.

2083
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Oh, I can't wait to be kicked out.

2084
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
What are you doing?

2085
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Are we doing it?

2086
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
If we did not hear some other raga in it...

2087
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I opened up Twitter and got jumpsfared.

2088
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
By what?

2089
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
What shenanigans are the girls up to know?

2090
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
My face is red, Ace Marble.

2091
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Bonjour!

2092
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Salut!

2093
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Bonjour!

2094
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2095
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I am sorry I left two French words.

2096
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,880
Sorry, I can't speak French

2097
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,380
I'm in total clear

2098
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,200
You can get nothing else from me. Oh no

2099
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:48,060
Tonight in Melbourne news down under locos wait tonight in the Melbourne news down under local

2100
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,880
Scottish woman is kicked out of a country for breaking

2101
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,960
20,000 necks by sitting on the faces of their

2102
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:02,880
Now it is true that she was trying to become a citizen, but they want to accept her so she's getting kicked out back to Scotland

2103
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,560
So adorable

2104
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:19,880
No, I just know how I'm gonna I unironically think I'm getting denied the right to the country and I think I'm gonna have to

2105
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,480
Stream from a hotel room whilst I make my pitfall way back to Scotland do I see

2106
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:30,040
I'm just not good at getting hit

2107
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
I

2108
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:46,280
Don't know what's happening with that, but that is life. It is a funny story good come back to Scotland is better here

2109
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:52,040
Anyway, it's fucking miserable. My family's like oh, it's boiling hot one thing then it's frozen the next and I'm like

2110
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,720
I

2111
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:55,720
Say that as if

2112
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,160
The houses are just out of shape

2113
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:02,760
So did you know that double glazing isn't a thing in Australia?

2114
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:11,400
If you didn't know double glazing keeps the heat out and keeps the warm in and maintains the temperature of the inside of the building

2115
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:17,720
Okay, and it's not common here only single pain is for some reason and

2116
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:21,480
Because it's not common. It's astronomical

2117
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,440
Scotland is just rain wait only single pain when literally

2118
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,600
It

2119
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:35,640
Literally in the country where it gets a bail in hot like it literally gets like bailing hot to like 45 degrees in the summer

2120
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:40,560
Or whatever and they went single pain windows so all the heat can leak in please. I'm like

2121
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,440
Whose logic is this because it's no mine

2122
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,960
It's no my logic so is Bush. I'm just I'm having it

2123
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,880
No my logic

2124
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:58,720
Oh, so you're talking about doughnuts. I mean if you want me to stack them on it like get it up. It's up to you

2125
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,880
Double glazing strong. Oh

2126
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,760
I get it now

2127
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:10,760
I understand the random doughnut comment because I was like what you on about right I get it now I get it now

2128
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,880
My apologies. I'm a bit slow. I'm a bit slow. We've got there in the end

2129
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,880
I

2130
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:22,720
Think you've got double glazing for me. Are you more of a single glaze kind of we flim, huh?

2131
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,760
wait, what and

2132
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:32,960
Glazing is a terminology for doughnuts and you put like a sugary glaze on top of it

2133
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:39,240
But because the sugary glaze looks a little bit transparent sometimes suspicious

2134
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:46,000
The glaze can also be referred to as in a different act that occurs between a

2135
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:48,440
Strony and a refling

2136
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:55,760
You can have double glazed windows absolutely and

2137
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,560
You mean like

2138
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,120
That you put in the walls

2139
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,120
Maybe I don't know

2140
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,520
Do you have mercy do not have mercy on us?

2141
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:29,440
You can double glaze the strongy if I save up at all currently 26 in my room at 9 p.m. Yeah

2142
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,560
Yeah

2143
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,480
So what the doughnuts refer to we need examples it

2144
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,480
Well mad doughnut is slang terminology for the old starfish

2145
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:52,080
Why why is it every time I see someone streaming this game? I see the building at this

2146
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,240
exact spot our old buildings the same and

2147
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,680
So we're in a place called edgeville

2148
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,120
But the bank is here and

2149
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:08,440
But people can do it at the Grand Exchange, but there's a lot of spammers and bots as for other banks

2150
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:15,000
I mean you could technically be at the top of Lumbridge, but edgeville is a good location, especially for free players

2151
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:18,000
We are not doing membership stuff

2152
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,120
That mood

2153
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,200
Hurry

2154
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
It's just a really convenient spot

2155
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:33,520
Have you ever used a scottish bagpipe? No, they're very expensive and inaccessible to most people

2156
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,360
And I've seen people use them, but I've never touched one

2157
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:44,720
There was a kid in my school that was getting like lessons in it and

2158
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,840
Yeah, do those things

2159
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,880
expensive

2160
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:58,400
Just asking Johnny how I can start with RuneScoop. It is a journey you take on your own

2161
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,000
Um

2162
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,160
Like I played it as a child. I had no idea what I was doing the numbers went off. I kept going and

2163
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:13,640
Yeah, time for a bagpipe. I am not playing them. I do not like bagpipes the drone of it is so annoying

2164
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,600
I

2165
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:23,280
Risk of getting insta-ban. I'll say I wouldn't mind double glazing. We're not we're not that bad around here

2166
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:30,320
I like to think that my my mods might my my moderators. Thank you to the hidden heroes of the stream. Um,

2167
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,160
They were all on the same page

2168
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,600
You know a little cheeky strong a bagpipe fund. Absolutely not

2169
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:39,840
absolutely not

2170
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:41,080
No chance

2171
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:46,760
Fake scott hates bagpipes. It's like mongolian throat singing. It's that drone like that

2172
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,840
And then bagpipes are also a freaking thing, okay

2173
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,640
Um

2174
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:06,040
We will make you love mongolian throat singing how dare you

2175
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,280
Yeah

2176
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,440
It's not happening

2177
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,680
We're at three thousand six hundred

2178
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:20,040
Or we're getting so tiny

2179
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,720
We're getting so tiny sorry

2180
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:26,200
Okay, let me let me check marshmallow. I'm an oldie

2181
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:30,520
Uh, I'm sorry mommy. I really wish I could send an audio or video for you

2182
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:34,520
But because of my living situation I can oh don't worry about you don't have to do that

2183
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:41,000
At least I can offer up a scenario for you to think about dare we read it. Is this going to be too saucy?

2184
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:43,880
Well, let me man, Mac

2185
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:49,720
So I wish I could be your living maid wearing nothing but an apron or whatever you want and I take care of things around the house

2186
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:53,720
Well, you're working hard on top of that. I am free use. Okay, I do

2187
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,720
I

2188
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:10,360
Okay, that's a cute scenario. I like it free use rethink

2189
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:20,120
Hey mommy, I'd like to recommend a game sheepy a short adventure is free cute and short

2190
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,680
Hmm. Is that because we played the

2191
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,640
um

2192
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
It's that because we played the

2193
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:37,160
The turnip boy robs a nope that comes next week. Oh my god. I'm leaking my my content next week. I'm leaking all over the chair

2194
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:44,040
I'm trying to draw circles why they even know if I'm drawing how close the straw need a leveling up. Um, we

2195
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,920
are the halfway mark

2196
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:52,520
We've got the 3000 more to go so that'll take us to just over an hour

2197
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:56,680
Maybe just shy of two hours

2198
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:02,680
I'm not sure you guys will be able to guess to make better than me

2199
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:06,840
I'm a fake rinscape player. I just do this for male attention

2200
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:15,080
Okay, right, right, right. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This stream was pre-recorded. No, it wasn't

2201
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:20,920
Stop it's not pre-recorded. That's not even today's date

2202
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:25,720
Today's date is 5 41 a.m

2203
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,720
on

2204
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,720
The ninth of the eighth month

2205
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,560
Stop they're gonna believe it

2206
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:41,640
You're winding me up your success, but it was recorded a week before it. No, it wasn't. I was literally live at this time a week ago

2207
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:45,560
Live on stream. I stream every day

2208
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,160
They're winding me up

2209
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,720
They're winning

2210
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,720
Pre-recorded stream. Mommy hates no

2211
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:58,120
Pre-recorded for male attention real and true

2212
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:04,440
Guys, there's a meal doing her gameplay far out. Stop every player winding me up

2213
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,880
I'm sure there was a

2214
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,400
Like that or they're pretending to play

2215
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:15,480
Hey, we'll make it back from a week-long cruise in Alaska

2216
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,280
Alaska hardly even know her

2217
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:23,320
Okay

2218
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:27,960
And took a lot of pics. Do you want to see them? Why not? Oh my god

2219
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,920
Did you see any animals?

2220
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:36,440
Or every time I hear Alaska, I think of two things snow and wild animals. That's it

2221
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:41,960
The chapters are a figment of my imagination. Take my mates. I'm never taking my mates again ever

2222
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,000
She says that she's currently on beta blokers for her heart

2223
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,560
Get off the stage pre-recorded and letting someone

2224
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:56,040
Other do it just so she has to she can reply to the app. How can she pre-recorded? She hates us

2225
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:01,160
You're giving the refling brainwarp stop it

2226
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,040
bunk

2227
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,520
Yeah, maybe with all the excitement I'd only need one thrust

2228
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:14,120
But as you've learned some of us can more go more than one round

2229
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,000
So either way you're leaving satisfied

2230
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:24,120
You'll be learning to what you'll be leaving with a funny walk after I do your back door

2231
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,520
Oh

2232
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,960
A refling. Oh, it's all grapes

2233
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:39,800
I'll be all grape in you in a minute. Whoa, you can't say that

2234
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:44,120
Take your meds the reflins can't be your coping mechanism

2235
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:48,120
The end the incident wasn't your fault that accident wasn't me

2236
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:53,640
There's no way it's her playing at this extremely high skill level someone else's on the keyboard

2237
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:59,640
Honestly, the clicking is just too much for the the wham and brain to comprehend. Look at that

2238
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:05,160
See how see how before I was crossing off the tab and then mixing them and then confirming

2239
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:08,200
Look at all that wasted time. No, I'm just

2240
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:18,680
The current date is the 1st of august. Ah, that's it bend over

2241
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,400
There's only one way to deal with misbehaving reflins

2242
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:33,160
There's only one game first rinse game stream. I'm glad to be here to see the money shot literally like what one

2243
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:35,480
Everway, maybe

2244
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:40,040
No mummy madona. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're talking about glazing madona bend over

2245
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,440
No more

2246
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,440
You're not getting me

2247
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,840
And put that oh my god the skills the skills

2248
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:55,160
Hi strawny. Hi reflin. I want to drink your saliva every day until just the thought your saliva makes me thirsty

2249
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:58,600
Are you squidding me right now?

2250
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,040
My little reflin

2251
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:05,080
Come on stream chat and strawny already flirting

2252
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:08,120
Come on, I lean

2253
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,720
If you can't come

2254
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,000
enter

2255
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,960
Mezzo come on her now playing come on. I lean

2256
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,560
Thank you. Sorry. Yeah. I bw for the

2257
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:24,760
So true this stinger is coming out we've seen reflin

2258
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:30,600
I was laughing when I used my loading screen on the ac collab

2259
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:32,840
and

2260
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:38,360
Because she was like we're obviously we're just trying to wait before the stream and she was like, uh, do you want to use it or

2261
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,960
No, and I'm and I was like, oh, I don't normally she was like, yeah, no, that's why I'm asking

2262
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:47,000
I'm like, oh, okay. I'll use I'll use it. So we agreed to come up at the same time

2263
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:50,280
But I probably gave some of yous a heart attack scene the loading screen

2264
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,560
But it's because I need to be professional

2265
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:04,440
How many hours of sleep did you get refling and I swear if one of you goes like two hours because I wake up in the middle

2266
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:07,800
Of my sleep just to watch you naughty spanking

2267
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:13,160
You use what impossible stretch. Oh, you want me straight right now?

2268
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:23,400
Half an hour. No, we're only deranged because of moment and because of the hypnosis

2269
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,920
Well, we're at 3.4

2270
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I'm gonna be in the twos

2271
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:41,560
I saw it eight hours five hours eight ten eight four

2272
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,600
I haven't slept just three a.m. For you

2273
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:49,320
You're in the same country as me

2274
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:57,720
Hold on a minute. Let me do some math. You're in the same land mass as me. But where I'm currently triangulating your position right now

2275
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,400
Oh my god, you're in Paris. What the fuck open your mouth

2276
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,960
Please forgive me. I can't believe this is really oh

2277
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:21,240
Great leg muscles are leading cause of back pain stretching is good

2278
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:25,480
You know, there's other kinds of stretch and that really helped the body

2279
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:31,400
Paris bro still losing a shit about me. Well, that's a lovely straw. Yeah, yeah, thanks for that

2280
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,840
It's 3 a.m

2281
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,800
Not 3 a.m. 5 a.m. Yeah 5 a.m

2282
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:45,880
You're super cool and in the coolest time zone if it's 5 a.m. Right now

2283
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,600
You're in the coolest ever time zone

2284
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,160
What happens if we like kissed in the same time zone?

2285
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,720
You miss them

2286
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:06,200
Perth bros, why is your response? Yeah, you play all through runescape. Yeah, I'm getting my first skill cape today. Look look look looky

2287
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,040
We're almost there. We have

2288
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,960
3000 more wines to go

2289
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:16,360
And then we've got my first ever skill cape

2290
01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:20,760
You should play subnautica go back to the sea they're cuttlefish and reef

2291
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:23,560
backs and reef laying

2292
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:27,640
Um, yeah, I've been asked to play a few times. Look at that

2293
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:32,920
I'm in the opposite time zone of woman. It's almost nine a night. Yeah getting

2294
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:41,560
Brian strony the type of gal to be a bratty dork until you sit the bratty cuttlefish on your lap and then folds like origami

2295
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,040
strontagami

2296
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,040
strontagami

2297
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,840
I do like him

2298
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,840
I'm not no

2299
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:57,160
No, wrong. Sorry. Yeah

2300
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,600
Wrong

2301
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:03,000
Very

2302
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
No, that's completely false

2303
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:08,440
And you can't prove either that I get intimidated. Okay

2304
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,560
You can't prove that I get intimidated

2305
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,800
I'm gonna shine

2306
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,800
I just get shy, okay

2307
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,360
Can we make thunder and lightning together?

2308
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:25,640
Oh, that's actually really good. ASMR stream. I make thunder and lightning

2309
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,360
That note doesn't sound really confident

2310
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:40,680
Can you name your gamer sub soodle noodle? Oh my god, by the way, I looked at the gamer sub statistics

2311
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:46,440
Thank you to like anyone and everyone who I run. Oh speaking of gamer subs for anyone who

2312
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:51,560
Unironically dead use code strony at checkout. Uh, thank you

2313
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:58,920
Uh, I appreciate it. It helps it a lot if you didn't know mercy received her pr package

2314
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:02,520
I also have the pr package. Um

2315
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:09,400
Type thing from them. I mean we could go through it together. I'm a bit boring though

2316
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:14,120
I'm not sure if I could make it fun unless it was just like a regular hand cam

2317
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:21,720
Stream, I'm not sure. Hmm. Let them know use code strony for 10% off gamer subs, literally

2318
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:26,760
Um, but yeah, thank you to everyone who has

2319
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:28,200
um

2320
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,200
gone for it

2321
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,480
a

2322
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:37,960
Yeah, I checked out my statistics. I was surprised. Yeah, you can fold her full nelson style

2323
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:42,360
She said so herself that she can put her ankles behind her ears

2324
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:46,280
I said that in confidence reflin

2325
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,040
You can't just say it's so present

2326
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:53,960
I said that in confidence

2327
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:58,840
Uh

2328
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,960
Thank you, sorry and where's the tip?

2329
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Motherfucker

2330
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,760
There's fan art of that

2331
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:11,480
Oh, can't we towards the very weak

2332
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:17,480
Should call one of your gamer subs flavors clam chowder on i'm not

2333
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:25,560
So i'm gonna try and be a bit devious once there's a few more sales. I'm gonna see if they're willing to um

2334
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:34,280
They they did say we can publicly release what the numbers are in terms of what would

2335
01:50:35,240 --> 01:50:37,240
Get us a cup

2336
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:39,240
Um

2337
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,800
But if it goes well, um, then

2338
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:49,240
We'll ask for a cup. Um, and then if it continues to go well

2339
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:56,920
Then we could be cheeky shites and ask for a flavor, but I think it would be a group flavor. It wouldn't be like a

2340
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:02,760
It wouldn't be a thing out of all the energy drinks. I'm trying to coffee. So is the best

2341
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:05,720
Yeah, I'm not I'm not expecting you to

2342
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:13,640
Oh, did certain flavors get held or cut open at checkout because of rules. I know vv had some stuff checked out

2343
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:19,080
Uh, I didn't open the box inspect element on it. Um

2344
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,360
Maybe I should

2345
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:28,280
Have so much space look look how far these spaces go in. It's just chaos in this little bar

2346
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:34,600
You think we wouldn't watch gamer soaps after watching tens of thousands of wines. We're all in baby

2347
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:38,440
I may I don't know. Maybe at the

2348
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:46,840
Maybe just make it a minute, but then I could make it an education and be like this is what a pr package looks like

2349
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:53,480
Mercy's done one recently. I'll wait to see if anyone else wants to do one and if not then I

2350
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:57,160
I'm gonna message gamer sips and be like, hey

2351
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:02,600
I'm allowed to talk about this process and maybe make it more an educational stream about what the process was like because

2352
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:05,240
And acapella media were super nice

2353
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:09,880
Like I literally yapped and like leaked all the secrets about what I'm buying the scenes and they were like, this is amazing

2354
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,880
We're gonna make a youtube video and I'm like, what the fuck?

2355
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:19,880
Um, but yeah, I'll ask them and I'll see and then maybe turn into an educational stream with a pr package or so

2356
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:22,920
and

2357
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:25,640
Should call it cuttlefish ink

2358
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:37,320
Shut up and take my bottle cap. I love that currency. I think it's such a good currency

2359
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:41,400
Fallout were they they cooked with that. Oh, yeah, someone cooked with that one

2360
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:44,440
We watch everything mummy does on spiny

2361
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:48,040
Sups flavor siren slurp juice

2362
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,920
scrawny substance

2363
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:54,520
What would everyone's flavors be called

2364
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,800
Did you hear my stomach there

2365
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,280
Hello rumble

2366
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:05,880
Do you are you watching any anime we're watching?

2367
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:16,440
Sugar sweet life shit, I don't know what it's called. We're watching it very shortly

2368
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:24,040
We're watching is my happy sugar life or something like that. I'm so sorry

2369
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:31,960
The happy sugar life. Okay. I got it. I got it baby. I got it

2370
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:36,520
Um, we're watching an anime next week together

2371
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:42,040
Because I'm gonna start a series called turn me into a weep and if it goes well then

2372
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:44,840
Every month. I think we'll watch one anime together

2373
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:48,920
and if it doesn't really work out how I plan then

2374
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,000
you know, I'll just

2375
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
do gaming as I always do because

2376
01:53:53,640 --> 01:54:00,440
Definitely a gamer over a weave, but if you prefer more weave orientated VTubers, definitely check out Zura. Um

2377
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,400
She she knows everything

2378
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:06,040
And I'm like, hmm. Yes. I've never heard of this before

2379
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:11,640
Apparently something happened in my hero academia nuts. Okay

2380
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,560
I don't know what happened in my hero

2381
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:22,440
But apparently it was terrible and everyone has left with a a bad taste in their mouth

2382
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:25,000
It just ended or officially ended

2383
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:27,880
I mean, are we allowed to talk about it?

2384
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:34,200
And you guys just give me the rundown because I watched for froppy and then I gave up in season two because the fillers were starting to kill me a bit

2385
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,920
Hmm

2386
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:40,920
L ending L Deku lamest shonen character. Oh, right

2387
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,560
Uh, banha the ending

2388
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,920
Like every shonen ending is kind of not written

2389
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,760
cute

2390
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:54,840
Mummy cute mummy wife. Mummy look like the love of my life. Oh, that's so cute. What the fuck?

2391
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,080
That's a cute little model

2392
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:05,160
Um, it was rushed and anti-climactic at the end. I just watched the first season. Yeah, it was awful

2393
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:13,080
Deku's mom said chubby so it's a win-win. Lamal, that's the note bars. Trauny flavor brainy starfish

2394
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:17,560
Speaking of my starfish, I'm away for a fart

2395
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:24,680
That was the quietest fart. I didn't even have to mute for that. I'm gonna be honest

2396
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:30,280
Froppy that would be good ASMR. They turned Deku emo

2397
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:34,760
Is is that why emi's in shambles right now?

2398
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,840
She she needed a week off

2399
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:43,400
I'm teasing by the way. She got banned by estaban a fucking rat

2400
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,720
But it's okay

2401
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:57,640
Are you baking bread?

2402
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:00,440
Um, no

2403
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I had anxiety this morning

2404
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:06,440
And my anxiety makes me shit myself

2405
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:13,880
So I woke up and I had a really sore tummy and I went to the toilet. So I have no bread

2406
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,400
Like you gotta take the pros with the cons when it comes to abomb. Okay. I'm taking the pros

2407
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:22,360
Um

2408
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:28,920
Bye. I took my my little heart medication my auntie adrenaline. Whatever you want to call it. It's two in one

2409
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,400
um

2410
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:35,080
And hopefully I'll be I'll feel better soon. But um

2411
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:42,120
I'm really sure what to what the solution is. There is no present solution at the moment

2412
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:46,760
To my situation

2413
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:51,720
Um

2414
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:58,280
Oh icicle snow berries. Oh my god. I'm so sorry you're watching the most boring gameplay

2415
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,240
Versus honey cam studios

2416
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:09,880
Honey cam studios versus click simulator on runescape. I'm gonna be honest honey cam studios definitely is a lot better than

2417
01:57:10,520 --> 01:57:12,520
This but thank you for the redirect icicle

2418
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:15,080
Uh, sorry snow berries

2419
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:21,800
Completely do not feel bad for clicking off honey cam studios as a hoot in a holler versus uh runescape

2420
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:24,200
Um

2421
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:27,720
But just to caught up to speed I have three thousand more wines

2422
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:32,760
We're about to hit the two thousands actually and then I have my first ever skill cape on runescape

2423
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:37,720
Which I'm very excited about I'm gonna have to buy a bond because

2424
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:40,440
Apparently in order to claim a runes

2425
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,280
Uh a skill cape

2426
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:45,720
You need a bond for it. So you can't even claim it for free

2427
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:50,520
They they really uh shafted three players out of that one. I thought that was a bit egregious

2428
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:55,560
But yes, thank you icicle. Please rest well after you stream

2429
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:02,280
Hey, hi, john. Have you some hi snow berries? Oh, did you enjoy uh honey cam?

2430
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:10,040
We we played at one point did did she outdo my trophy? Did she get a bronze trophy?

2431
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:13,400
Or are a gold or silver a diamond?

2432
01:58:14,360 --> 01:58:19,400
Honey cam was great, but that wasn't even anything close to the most unhinged part of that stream

2433
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:22,200
Well, you better clip it so I can turn it into shorts for

2434
01:58:23,240 --> 01:58:26,840
I hope you haven't get the yeah anything. She didn't get a trophy. Oh, no

2435
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,800
Oh, my wee ac

2436
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:35,720
Um, it was a fever dream of a stream. Is it allowed to stay up?

2437
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:38,280
snowberries

2438
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,520
Is the stream allowed to remain?

2439
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:43,640
Was she censoring her words?

2440
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,760
Did she say banal?

2441
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:48,440
instead of

2442
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:54,520
There's a going to be so many clips from the stream. Okay. Okay. I'm complaining like the the shorts

2443
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,880
The short editors are on standby. So I'm not complaining

2444
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,080
If you guys want to load her up

2445
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:04,360
Maybe it might have to be taken down

2446
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:07,320
It is but she was super

2447
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:11,800
After the stream time to check up the stream before it gets new to literally

2448
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,240
Oh

2449
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,480
But yes, thank you again icicle for the redirect

2450
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:21,480
But yes, snowberries keep you up to date and please don't feel forced to watch the gameplay

2451
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:28,040

Approximately, we're thieving sitting in there. Um, we are approximately t-minus like two hours away from it

2455
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:44,600
Um, I've just been yapping my head off. Um, we were debating whether it will survive very long

2456
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:48,120
We think we broke her a little but we're so happy. She feels better post stream now

2457
01:59:52,440 --> 02:00:00,440
What did you do to my feral polar bear did you break that message her or is she like engaged if you know what i'm saying

02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:18,680

2462
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,760

Naughty boy

2465
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:32,440

02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:27,800
She's fine. Don't worry. She ended the stream saying she felt much better than when she started

2476
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:32,040
She wrote very specific. That's all the specific

2477
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:39,880

I want to put

2556
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:50,520
Right the first thing that comes up is I want to put the bone of my sword inside

2557
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:57,320
Starfish and give her a strong heavens feel. I don't think that was the mean

2558
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:00,120
and then the next one

2559
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,240
Is

2560
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:05,480

1940

2572
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:04,760
Uh, the author was told to put in those scenes so it would sell but he's really bad at writing them. Oh

2573
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,720
I mean it does sum up the refunds pretty well though

2574
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:21,400
Like you're a good little stress release one as I said, I get my I get my de-stress and on swing

I'm glad I'm glad it actually looks like her now

2582
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
My little rabbit

2583
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:19,000
Apparently there's a store in the Netherlands called the refund store. Good

2584
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:24,520
By the power of this command seal, I order you shit. You're what?

2585
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:28,520
If you had a chance to change your fate, would you

2586
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:31,320
sometimes

2587
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:39,320
She might do a gorilla, but only she feels well enough. She was looking after fia. She was sending me repictures

2588
02:10:39,960 --> 02:10:41,320
and

2589
02:10:41,320 --> 02:10:43,320
I've also been so social with me

2590
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:44,520
Um

2591
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:48,600
She was sending me pictures of fia and I was absolutely adoring it and she looks so precious

2592
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:54,200
She's like such a pretty cat as well. Like I've only ever had Tabby's my whole life

2593
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,760
Wait, what bots can talk?

2594
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:05,720
Am I going mental should I be muting someone should I be muting someone?

2595
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:12,600
In the chat monk eyes, sorry, I don't know if there's bot spam going on and I'm ignoring it because I'm yapping away at myself

2596
02:11:13,480 --> 02:11:15,480
ellipses

2597
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:22,280
Any survival tips for a gymnasium?

2598
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:25,880
No

2599
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:28,280
We flings come when they aren't

2600
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:31,560
pictures of a we's gone

2601
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:35,960
Yeah, and she was sending me pictures of fia and I was like, oh, she actually has a we's gone

2602
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:41,720
She was so precious and like she had a like a bib on and everything it was so cute

2603
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:55,240
Yeah, so do that bots are ever in the game can't get rid of them for real now just old school runescape crafting bots are these ones

2604
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,920
That's a

2605
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:02,920
So these ones the the level three

2606
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:07,480
I remember there's like a big old debate they were like, oh

2607
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,520
If you go a bit to the box or the economy

2608
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:14,360
Because everything become expensive or whatever

2609
02:12:15,640 --> 02:12:17,640
I'm very curious

2610
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:21,800
Check the fit on this one. Yeah, damn

2611
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:25,400
Oh, we got Gardner

2612
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:28,120
I mean the fit matches is a pretty good fit

2613
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:36,760
That's why a lot of mid game money makers are good again

2614
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:42,840
I personally wouldn't use this particular name anywhere

2615
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:47,640
I'm a swamp witch not Gardner, but your your thing has garden

2616
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:54,520
I mean you do look like a witch because of the hat and that but I would say you're like a nice Gardner that comes from the garden

2617
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:58,760
You're like you're like seedos from beaver pinata because you live in a swamp

2618
02:13:00,120 --> 02:13:04,120
I can't I can't choose between the seeds. They're all my favorite

2619
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:11,080
Did she reach big number yet? I'm about to literally I am so close

2620
02:13:13,720 --> 02:13:18,920
Wait, I don't have to go like through 99 right like it's done after this one

2621
02:13:20,360 --> 02:13:23,400
Right, I don't like have to level up through 99

2622
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:30,440
And like I'm about to get jump-scared and runescape you have to level up through 99 as well. Yeah, it's done at 99

2623
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:32,440
Okay at 99. Thank god

2624
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:38,200
It's a cabbage cape not a skill cape. It's a fake. Sorry. You found out this way. It's not real

2625
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:43,080
It's not real him. Is it hair blower or something?

2626
02:13:44,600 --> 02:13:49,720
It should be okay. It would turn into a h word stream. No, it turned into an r word stream real quick

2627
02:13:50,440 --> 02:13:53,320
I thought imagine not getting 200 million at no chance

2628
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:58,920
You have to go 120 imagine playing runescape 3 you're like half an hour away

2629
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:01,160
Really?

2630
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:03,160
Am I actually?

2631
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:05,320
I don't am I

2632
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,600
I'm 30 minutes away from my first runescape

2633
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:13,080
So I feel like I'm going to be like run into the grand exchange

2634
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:17,160
She'll like get um crafting stuff because apparently you do crafting in like four hours

2635
02:14:18,360 --> 02:14:20,680
You maxed out on runescape 3

2636
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:23,560
how

2637
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:28,040
Old-school runescape on mobile. It's on like anything. It's everywhere

2638
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:32,360
I'm staying around then a little dancy dancy

2639
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:41,000
My god, x fees a lot faster in runescape 3. Didn't they not make it equal because if it's 120 levels

2640
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,500
You have to gain in runescape 3 wouldn't then just be the same

2641
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:49,000
The fastest max in this game is like 17 days or something

2642
02:14:49,880 --> 02:14:53,080
Wait fully maxed out a count

2643
02:14:56,920 --> 02:15:00,760
Nah, they were running dragon bones to the altar because there's no way

2644
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:07,400
Yeah, there were two youtubers that raced a honey watch that series

2645
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:11,080
Are you planning on doing anything else once you've got 99 in the cape?

2646
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:12,840
I was gonna do

2647
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:18,840
Um questing together because I'm not very familiar with the quest, but I really enjoyed walking around together

2648
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:24,040
Um, but the only problem with questing is you need membership for it. Basically

2649
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:28,360
And I don't like the idea of stream sniping games that cost money

2650
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:35,080
Like it kind of sucks. She says that she's picked vermin tide 2 this week. I know I know have a critical. Um

2651
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:38,360
But it'll be worth trust trust, okay?

2652
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:44,680
Um, I'm actually needing to play vermin tide to get familiar with the game again because it's been many a while

2653
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:46,440
um

2654
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:48,120
but yeah

2655
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:51,480
They also both just did iron man max speedruns just

2656
02:15:52,840 --> 02:15:54,840
Get 99 agility

2657
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:58,440
He

2658
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:00,680
Imagine playing an iron man, couldn't be me

2659
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:03,800
You mean the symbol right here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

2660
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:09,560
Dark tide win. What's dark tide? Is that not vermin tide?

2661
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:13,160
Hypno critical

2662
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:18,440
Quest help her plug in. Yeah, and you guys can help me too because you know what to do and I don't

2663
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:21,080
vermin tide but with guns

2664
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,080
I think vermin tide was gifted by steam to all users like a year ago. Wait, really?

2665
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:38,680
That's kind of me. Why would they do something so why would they do something so nice? What the heck?

2666
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,560
Oh

2667
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:50,280
It's free for a bit when dark tide, you know, oh to boost like it's thingy

2668
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:54,680
That was like what and that game series we were here did

2669
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:59,880
I think they came out with like the third or fourth installment. So they made the first one free

2670
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:02,840
Because like they were just racking in the bowl

2671
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:06,840
So don't worry

2672
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:11,000
It's like 40 key of clubs into vermin tide because vermin tide is I mean

2673
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,680
I

2674
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:15,880
Liked it when I played it. I thought it was fine

2675
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:23,720
I don't know. Maybe I was mistaken. I thought it was all right. I thought it was all right. Choose me

2676
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:26,600
I thought it was fun

2677
02:17:27,880 --> 02:17:30,120
The same thing happened to arc which had a pc

2678
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:34,200
Xbox game

2679
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:38,040
It's really fun. I think it's right. Um

2680
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:45,880
I'm a bit I'm not stuck on what stream snipe games too much just yet. Um

2681
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:50,120
I

2682
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:52,120
I'm struggling to pick

2683
02:17:52,680 --> 02:17:54,600
something

2684
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:58,680
I don't know. I really enjoyed fortnite. Sorry. I did. I know I know

2685
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:04,440
For these kids game. I really enjoyed fortnite. It was cute. It was fun. Um, I could get you guys in

2686
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:09,560
I didn't realize we were going against bot. So yeah, I got a bit excited. Okay, the egg is on my face

2687
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:11,720
but

2688
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:13,720
If we put the fortnite

2689
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:16,360
metal path

2690
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:18,840
I just shit

2691
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,920
out my head

2692
02:18:21,720 --> 02:18:23,720
And I put it on my pc

2693
02:18:24,360 --> 02:18:28,520
Because I need me to get the fortnite battle path

2694
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:31,480
Uh

2695
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:37,880
Um a left for dead stream. I haven't actually properly played that game

2696
02:18:39,160 --> 02:18:46,120
And it looks really scary and I don't I haven't played it. I played dead island

2697
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:54,520
Feast like a vampire with a woman. Who do you voodoo man up?

2698
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:58,920
But yeah, I never played left for dead. Can we play left for dead together?

2699
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Can we play it together?

2700
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:11,080
Don't think I won't do that game up if we can play left for dead together. I'm on it. You're in my team. Okay, you're chatting down the make

2701
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:16,600
But you're not allowed to spill your spaghetti down the make or it'll be forever memorialized

2702
02:19:17,240 --> 02:19:19,240
via stream

2703
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:24,280
You never played left for dead. Yeah, you can play it together against each other. You can do 4v4

2704
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:28,520
What I thought the game was about surviving zombies. Why would you attack each other?

2705
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:31,400
Hey, this is my turn

2706
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:37,720
I want to destroy all the zombies in it. No, this is my turn. I want to destroy the zombies

2707
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:41,320
Oh, you get to be the zombie

2708
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:45,480
Okay, I'ma be the zombies and chase the reeflings

2709
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:52,840
I'm sorry

2710
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:55,240
Let me bite your tentacle

2711
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:01,080
Okay, we're definitely doing that because I want to do that

2712
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:11,400
Yep, I tried to play it but I had too much stick to

2713
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:20,680
My brain is gone. Tentacle is too big for you and you take a couple inches off so then it'll fit

2714
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:26,280
I'm like you're I'm like the bar you're like the worst barber in the world

2715
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:30,600
I'm like, I can't fit it. So do me a favor and it's gone and then then you can fit

2716
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:33,880
Is there cross play? I

2717
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:37,720
You know more than me at this point in time. You know more than me

2718
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:48,920
They're releasing another massive horde shooter in september space marine looks good even if you're not into warhammer

2719
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:51,880
Hmm

2720
02:20:52,440 --> 02:20:54,440
Hmm curious

2721
02:20:56,120 --> 02:21:04,360
For anyone that played back for blood, did it get better or no? We need the foremost tryhard players to own stroney in the girl

2722
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:08,680
Oh, maybe I could get the girls in on stream sniping

2723
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:13,960
And I'll teach them the ways I'll teach them that it's fun

2724
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,960
And that they should get used to coming games all the time

2725
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:21,720
Oh, I wouldn't mind that four

2726
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:23,880
four girls

2727
02:21:23,880 --> 02:21:27,880
And uh, you're all trying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bealer versus

2728
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:32,280
Replace et cetera whoever wants to join

2729
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:36,680
A treat her like a good piece of good Brian

2730
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:42,200
Treat her like a good best of toast butter em up and make her crumb

2731
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:45,320
You're done

2732
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:51,960
Time to go to bed. Sorry. I thank you for the super chat Brian. Don't read that out again. That was a terrible attempt. Okay

2733
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:57,400
Uh vealer versus investors reveal and true

2734
02:21:59,320 --> 02:22:03,560
Yonzer contagious. I'm so sorry. I never got big sleep. I go

2735
02:22:05,240 --> 02:22:10,680
Like five hours, but I woke up an hour before my alarm, which isn't normal

2736
02:22:11,560 --> 02:22:15,240
Because I had a big adrenaline drop when it's really annoying when it does it

2737
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:22,200
I was awake because I can't sleep when once the adrenaline is coursing through your blood. Unfortunately, it's very hard to fall asleep

2738
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:28,920
Because literally I'll be I'm in bed, you know, I'm chilling gimme gimme obviously magnetized to my my heat

2739
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:31,160
and

2740
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:35,000
And then my body just like floods itself with adrenaline and I'm like brah

2741
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:39,880
I was literally just asleep five seconds ago. What was going on? So I had to get up and

2742
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:44,600
This sounds really sad, but I don't I don't mean it to sound sad

2743
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:46,760
But I basically

2744
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:52,520
Slumped against the wall in the hallway and and gimli and vego were comforting me and

2745
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:55,880
I was just waiting for the

2746
02:22:55,880 --> 02:22:57,320
Adrenaline to stop

2747
02:22:57,320 --> 02:23:01,800
Basically because the medicine takes a hot second to kind of get in the the system

2748
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:05,720
But I was like literally slumped against the wall to the door

2749
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:09,560
The

2750
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:13,320
But don't I don't mean it in a sad way

2751
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:18,200
But if it gets too sad, I'll stop talking about it because I don't want you to worry like I don't mind telling you what's up

2752
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:19,640
but yeah

2753
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:24,760
How's the heart been lately strong? He's been feeling better since the little health scare

2754
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:28,200
Yes, I've not had a heart. I've had I've had a

2755
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:32,600
So that heart flutter and was pretty severe. I have it when I lie

2756
02:23:33,160 --> 02:23:35,160
Down from standing up

2757
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:37,240
So I'm needing to be a bit careful

2758
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:40,360
But it's not bad

2759
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:47,640
I think I'm just you know, the stress is get I have is a bit of stress last night. Um, unfortunately

2760
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:52,840
I was editing I was feeling a bit overwhelmed because I tried to like a billion things at once as always

2761
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:54,680
and

2762
02:23:54,680 --> 02:23:56,680
We should have held you

2763
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:03,880
Gimli was like doing backflips on me. I'm like gimli, please. I feel so sick right now. Like I feel so ill

2764
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:06,360
and

2765
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:09,320
I was worried I wasn't even gonna be able to get through this stream

2766
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:15,160
But as I said like as soon as I start stream like I just feel like myself again and like it's just fun

2767
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:18,440
And it's a hoot and a holler and you know that goodness

2768
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:21,560
That's what happens to me. Anyway

2769
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:28,280
Hold on. Let me check marshmallow

2770
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:32,360
What are you saying?

2771
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:35,320
I have no idea what the first word of this writer

2772
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,880
How about you plugging for a member's ASMR

2773
02:24:41,240 --> 02:24:43,240
Replay

2774
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:45,800
That's a terrible idea

2775
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:53,560
You can't believe you had the audacity to even tape something like that

2776
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:58,040
Deal

2777
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:02,520
Replay that's awesome

2778
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:04,520
I have

2779
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,520
thalasophobia

2780
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:12,200
But that doesn't mean anything when I'm with you. I love you mommy. Love you too, Reiflin. What's thalasophobia?

2781
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:15,400
Does anyone know what thalasophobia is?

2782
02:25:17,560 --> 02:25:22,680
Uh, I have had my heart checked. I'm basically on observations if I have um,

2783
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:29,320
An incident with my heart I'm to go get uh go back to the doctor and then they're gonna do a bit more

2784
02:25:30,280 --> 02:25:32,280
I'm post-immigration. Um

2785
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:35,080
Fear of the ocean. Oh

2786
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:41,640
If you're scared, oh, you're scared of liquids you've come to the wrong place because that ain't like nothing on air

2787
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:51,720
You'll be drowning in it when a british person sees a drone drowning in it

2788
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:58,440
Drowning in it. There's like droning it drowning it drowning it

2789
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:02,120
Do you get it? Do you remember it was a squidward meme?

2790
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:07,000
He's not a pirate. I'm glad you get the help

2791
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:13,640
Fucking love or the healthcare. They're so good. Oh, would you need I'm like, oh, I need this. This is what I used

2792
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:19,880
And then you give it to me. I'm all over here. Oh my god. They actually look into my problem

2793
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:26,200
We are up to our tentacles and ink. No, she said the meme

2794
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:28,440
Please laugh

2795
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:33,320
Thank you

2796
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:38,120
Wait, what was that? Wasn't that a gamer convention where the guy goes please clap

2797
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:42,280
What was that? Oh, no

2798
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:47,640
Is it the diablo reveal? I just remember the diablo reveal being an absolute disaster

2799
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:53,240
What you guys don't have uh, you guys don't have phones or something like that and everyone was like, of course

2800
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:58,040
We didn't want a fucking installment is a big microtransaction game get to fuck

2801
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:08,840
That's a politics thing. Oh, was it I thought it was for some reason I associated it with the

2802
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:13,960
Diablo 3 but is this an out of season april fools?

2803
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:17,800
They got annihilated

2804
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:23,640
Don't you guys have phones maybe the single funniest thing ever bro

2805
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:30,920
Let's you like, huh? Why is the reception so bad? And it was like wasn't the first two installments literally pc games

2806
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Why are you randomly swapping it to mobile?

2807
02:27:34,840 --> 02:27:36,840
And mobile

2808
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:45,160
Lots of people associated it to very unpopular things as a meme so myth transactions probably got a lot

2809
02:27:45,720 --> 02:27:47,720
Oh micro transactions got a lot

2810
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:50,200
Fun fact about the game

2811
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:52,200
It was a reskin of an existing

2812
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:56,040
mobile transaction game the guy pitching it

2813
02:27:57,240 --> 02:27:58,600
Who said

2814
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:03,240
That was from the chinese company that paid blizzard to let them use their ip

2815
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:07,800
No

2816
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:09,800
It's even worse

2817
02:28:10,280 --> 02:28:14,760
It's even worse than what we saw on the surface

2818
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:21,800
I had no idea. I thought they actually made that in full confidence. Oh

2819
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:27,800
Oh

2820
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:31,800
That's even worse

2821
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:38,440
Um, they also made a dead by daylight mobile game. Oh that made it to mobile

2822
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,120
Oh

2823
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:47,240
Mobile phones it was an epic failure for sure. I don't know why

2824
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:52,040
They don't usually have monetization as bad as diablo immortal

2825
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:57,400
I'm wondering if blizzard was like bruv if we're gonna sell out to the max

2826
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:06,280
The game is a weird reskin dear god. There's more literally that is I didn't know that I genuinely thought

2827
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:14,040
That blizzard went right mobile games micro transactions. Let's just get rid of this ip and you know burn it into the ground

2828
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:21,400
But it's even worse knowing that they were approached by an outside company and they were like hey, you know your ip

2829
02:29:22,120 --> 02:29:25,800
Uh, let's annihilate it together and then blizzard went. Yeah

2830
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:28,600
Yeah

2831
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:32,680
Wow, that's like 10 times worse than I could have suspected

2832
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,560
Did you play overcooked? Probably a later day

2833
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:45,480
Almost none of the original blizzard people with passion are left. Anyway. Oh, they're got

2834
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:48,520
Blizzard isn't a husk

2835
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:55,400
Um a husk. I mean, I know overwatch is knees out. Um

2836
02:29:56,840 --> 02:30:00,440
Literally overwatch is the only thing from blizzard that I personally

2837
02:30:01,560 --> 02:30:04,040
I mean, I've played world of warcraft type thing

2838
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:06,200
um

2839
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:08,200
The starcraft

2840
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:11,720
I'm already overcooked. I'm already tracer

2841
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:14,680
What about widowmaker? I'm already widowmaker

2842
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:20,520
You'll be thinking your fashion. We're at less than 2000 rip pathogen

2843
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:29,080
Also makes identity ryan health news doesn't make us sad or uncomfy mama

2844
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:34,840
It's the thought of something happening to you and at least being honest about it makes it less spooky

2845
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:39,960
Regardless reeflings will always stand by our favorite cephalopod

2846
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:41,560
Ah

2847
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:43,400
Thank you

2848
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:48,200
Anonymous or reeflings. I never know. I just say it says anonymous in the title, but thank you

2849
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:55,480
Okay, I'm glad it doesn't make you so comfy. I can't just shut up if it does like it doesn't bother me to like

2850
02:30:56,360 --> 02:30:57,480
as I said

2851
02:30:57,480 --> 02:31:04,680
My problems get fixed within 24 hours. So whenever I do complain about something it's like me. It's already gone

2852
02:31:04,920 --> 02:31:06,440
you know

2853
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:09,320
um and on reefling and on aning

2854
02:31:12,040 --> 02:31:13,400
Um

2855
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:18,920
They make good games that aren't pay to win. That's why I blame blizzard for diablo. Not the actual dev team. Oh

2856
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:22,520
Here's the plot thinking

2857
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:30,040
Uh, don't bottle it up unless it's your armpits, but speaking of bo. I have terrible bo right now

2858
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:32,200
I am pheromone maxing out the ones

2859
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:33,400
who

2860
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:34,440
Hey

2861
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:36,040
The hacker known as

2862
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:38,040
had on reefling

2863
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:43,400
Complain about something random now tomorrow will be fixed. It's okay if it makes you feel better than it's with you

2864
02:31:45,640 --> 02:31:54,280
Woo pheromone stinky literally is lost enough tomorrow. Ma I've been so stinky recently and I don't know why I'm like stink maxing right now

2865
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:58,360
I'm vile maxing

2866
02:31:59,240 --> 02:32:02,200
I don't know. I think my deodorant maybe I need a new deodorant

2867
02:32:03,960 --> 02:32:07,480
Not that I'm wearing any deodorant right now, but maybe I'm just in general

2868
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:10,200
I need a new deodorant to motivate me to put this

2869
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:15,720
Because I'll get a shower and I'll get all clean on use soap and all that

2870
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:22,680
And then instead of like putting deodorant on I just didn't bother and it's like kind of the whole point really

2871
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:26,600
Give me some of that smell

2872
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:32,840
Loose some pheromone scarlet rot maxing

2873
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:38,200
Stress can affect how stinky your sweat is right if that's the case

2874
02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:41,320
I'm like stressed out the wazoo and canny think straight

2875
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:43,960
Please put on your deodorant

2876
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:48,600
Can you smell me right now? I'm sorry. Your laziness just makes us want it more

2877
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:52,440
Get roll-ons are amazing. I use roll-ons

2878
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:57,240
I'm just so lazy after my shower

2879
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:02,760
Stress has a lot of negative increase in B. Oh, I did not even know that

2880
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:10,680
So this earwax, wait, did you know that milk is a modified form of sweat? So this earwax, what?

2881
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:17,720
I think earwax is like produced keep your eardrums all lubricated and new dust in them

2882
02:33:22,040 --> 02:33:26,440
Don't think you need to rush where she be. I thought she tweeted she's taking the night off. Okay, that's all good

2883
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:29,640
Taking the night off. There's okay

2884
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:35,800
Okay, can anyone of the Paris Bruce smell strong from where they are right now?

2885
02:33:36,680 --> 02:33:41,480
Honestly, oh my god. We're already at 1.7 almost. I can't believe it

2886
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,960
We're doing it. I'm actually getting up

2887
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:48,200
Someone just leveled up

2888
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:50,440
When you're leveling up someone just leveled up. I saw that

2889
02:33:51,320 --> 02:33:53,320
I saw it

2890
02:33:53,320 --> 02:33:55,320
I saw it

2891
02:33:56,120 --> 02:33:58,600
I don't know how you leveled up, but don't think I didn't catch that

2892
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:01,880
Oh my god

2893
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:03,960
I can't believe it. It was me

2894
02:34:04,040 --> 02:34:07,560
What did you level up? I was doing crafting. Oh, I thought you were doing winery

2895
02:34:10,040 --> 02:34:15,080
I'm imagining it dogs because your beel was absolutely weak in I promise you when I go outside

2896
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:19,000
I like shower and I put deodorant on and all that

2897
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:23,160
But on the simple fact that I don't

2898
02:34:23,960 --> 02:34:25,960
Go outside

2899
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:28,520
I don't do anything

2900
02:34:32,360 --> 02:34:34,680
It's that like there's no point

2901
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:41,000
I may be the most leveled refling the same everyone pointing laugh with the sph on that refill

2902
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:46,440
Shame him for his levels imagine the smell

2904
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:56,920

02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:58,920
What I need to

2906
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:01,480
You have the most game to play exactly

2907
02:35:02,840 --> 02:35:04,440
um

2908
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:08,280

2912
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:26,280

2913
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:33,240
I can I'm in Edinburgh and I can literally smell you in the ocean over the ocean real

2914
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:39,320
Do you have a dead rat to use as a sundial too wait what?

2915
02:35:42,280 --> 02:35:44,760
He has rat infestation

2916
02:35:50,360 --> 02:35:57,640
What a rat corpse that works as an alarm clock because it smelled when the sun hit it

2917
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:02,680
That has to be he made that has to be made up

2918
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:08,920
Oh

2919
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:11,320
Oh

2920
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:17,400
That's oh my that's fellow

2921
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I'm that I'm speechless I'm never speechless

2922
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:33,160
What

2923
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:35,160
I

2924
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:38,520
Kind of impressive her nas abroad honestly

2925
02:36:40,040 --> 02:36:44,360
That's not clutch. That's not crusty sock ASMR. Are you sure it's not your crusty underwear?

2926
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
How do you think I'm getting the sound effect?

2927
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:51,560
Look, I told you that I'm feeling a bit stress free these days

2928
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:54,520
You know, you don't know what I'm doing in my undies

2929
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:03,000
You're speechless in subspace too, so I don't know if that's necessarily true

2930
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:08,520
Why am I getting called out? No, I never mentioned subspace at all. You know what you're done, so

2931
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:15,720
That's that. I'm delaying my my blue stream application by one minute because of you

2932
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:19,320
I'm gonna send off myself and get all set up

2933
02:37:20,360 --> 02:37:25,000
I'm gonna ask Mercy how she set it up, but um, I'm not charging. I'm just

2934
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:27,960
So

2935
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:32,840
Let's see how the first stream goes if I get too shy then maybe

2936
02:37:34,360 --> 02:37:36,360
I don't know

2937
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:40,600
I don't know. I do want intimate experience, but I don't want to charge

2938
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:43,480
I want intimate

2939
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:46,520
Decisions

2940
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:51,720
A whole one minute delay the secret astronomy doesn't have crusty underwear she doesn't wear underwear

2941
02:37:51,880 --> 02:37:53,880
Yeah

2942
02:37:54,120 --> 02:37:56,120
Sometimes I don't want to stream

2943
02:37:57,880 --> 02:38:03,880
But I don't know. I feel like it's a good thing having my bare panini on my chair

2944
02:38:05,800 --> 02:38:07,800
Like imagine

2945
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:12,360
Imagine the ink on the chair

2946
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:16,120
Under where

2947
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:23,880
That's why I'm laughing at myself

2948
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:30,280
Some guy literally messed himself to try and get the most xt gained in skill and like a day he turned out to be a bit

2949
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:36,520
Old-school RuneScape players and hygiene go together like milk and monster

2950
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:39,240
That's a

2951
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:41,240
They're like a Pepsi and milk

2952
02:38:41,480 --> 02:38:43,480
challenge or something

2953
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:46,840
Underwear is gonna be pure oil extract after a few days

2954
02:38:47,480 --> 02:38:53,320
Chairs smeared with untold horrors honestly though the all audio that I did on twitter

2955
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:56,520
May or may not

2956
02:38:56,520 --> 02:38:58,520
have been that

2957
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:01,400
I'll need to um

2958
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:06,680
Get my all audio all set up. I really like the method that me did

2959
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:10,840
Where it's like a a list and you can like go seek out the audios. That's like

2960
02:39:12,280 --> 02:39:14,280
Sorry, but she's actually

2961
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:18,040
Then my chair's so ripped. I have to sit on a pillow

2962
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:25,320
Okay, but which one's worse your chair or sin

2963
02:39:27,560 --> 02:39:33,880
So I have a maincraft chair and it's black and I think you can't see anything because of it

2964
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:40,120
So sin's chair by default looks hell of a lot worse than mine, but I think the reality is mine is worse like

2965
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:47,240
Well, we were talking about it and both of us game bear arsed on it and I'm like we're probably as bad as each other at this point

2966
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:50,600
Um, was it a red bull and milk?

2967
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:54,680
Oh my god 1.6

2968
02:39:56,200 --> 02:40:01,560
Biohazard maxing literally means sin on a on a regular sunday afternoon

2969
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:04,280
Whose chair smells worse?

2970
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:07,880
So mine has the extra benefit of

2971
02:40:08,440 --> 02:40:13,880
Sweaty feet on it all the time like all the time like right now my sweaty feet are on the chair

2972
02:40:15,880 --> 02:40:20,200
So I don't know if that means I get extra points in that category

2973
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:24,920
You sit with your feet against your clam. Yeah. Yeah most of the time

2974
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:30,840
Considerance what sin just admitted about her chair. I think she may have you be wait. What did she say?

2975
02:40:31,400 --> 02:40:34,440
Wrong question. Who's smells better?

2976
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:38,200
I say mine probably smells like my ass more and hers smells like her

2977
02:40:38,840 --> 02:40:39,960
Vagina's

2978
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:41,960
I can't sorry

2979
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:46,760
Which chairs are more essence not a clue. Oh my god, we're head banging

2980
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:49,640
Oh, yeah, head bang

2981
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:57,400
Good luck on 99 year old Mr. Thank you, Riplyn. We're very very close like very close

2982
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:59,960
Like very close

2983
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:05,480
We're in 1.5 and then it'll be 1.4 and before we know it. There'll be 900

2984
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:11,000
Put pop rocks on your feet again. I'll do it. I think I won't

2985
02:41:12,280 --> 02:41:14,280
The lore is great. Thank you

2986
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:22,280
No, put pop rocks on your chair to safety. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, it wouldn't work like that. It's dry

2987
02:41:23,080 --> 02:41:24,680
Oh

2988
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:29,000
Oh my god fans Lee pop. Oh, I said the word uh blue stream

2989
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:34,040
Pop rocks when just to prove the witness

2990
02:41:36,440 --> 02:41:41,880
I wouldn't put it inside though just against before anyone's like, oh my god. No

2991
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:46,440
Approve

2992
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I

2993
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:52,920
Didn't name drop I didn't mean it. Okay, you can't prove it

2994
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
You can't prove nothing

2995
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:12,120
Uh, hey, we'll make high baseline. We're here as long as you need us to make sure you take extra care. Love these cutie fish

2996
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:18,520
A little seaweed as well

2997
02:42:22,520 --> 02:42:24,200
I'm getting a wee bit sleepy

2998
02:42:24,200 --> 02:42:27,880
I don't want to make a cup of tea though because we're literally about to finish

2999
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:31,480
And I don't want to I don't want to pause the grind

3000
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:36,680
So I'm gonna smack myself a week by not smacking myself at all

3001
02:42:37,480 --> 02:42:39,800
Because I want to be nice to myself. I'm just

3002
02:42:40,440 --> 02:42:43,240
It says 1800 and no

3003
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:45,240
183

3004
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:48,040
100,000 what 183,000

3005
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,640
Eggs pita go that literally is nothing

3006
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:54,920
um

3007
02:42:54,920 --> 02:43:01,560
Anyway, this is a point in the stream where clipper say who asked and clips all over the place. What are you on about? What are you smoking?

3008
02:43:03,800 --> 02:43:05,800
Sleepy strongy gentificate

3009
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:10,280
A little over 30 minutes, it's the home stretch

3010
02:43:11,240 --> 02:43:14,440
Hey clam diving with pop rocks in your mouth

3011
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:17,480
That I wouldn't even

3012
02:43:18,200 --> 02:43:21,640
Oh, but can I put pop rocks on you though?

3013
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:28,680
When I when I you know if you were to like suck calamari

3014
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:31,400
Can I put pop rocks on the end of it?

3015
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:34,200
and

3016
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:38,520
Would that work or would that if I would that feel like

3017
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:47,400
A blue stream smoking the seaweed when I don't take it because I have addictive personality

3018
02:43:50,120 --> 02:43:52,120
Yes, but it can be painful

3019
02:43:54,200 --> 02:43:58,520
Sounded like you're talking from experience. Come on preach to the choir the choir want to know

3020
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:06,120
Now I'm curious pop rocks all spelunky. Oh, no, I don't even want to imagine that

3021
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:11,000
I mean we could find out if you want

3022
02:44:12,440 --> 02:44:17,080
I'm not gonna be enthusiastic about it, but I guess you know wherever it goes goes

3023
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:20,520
um

3024
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:23,800
Don't feel free to share with the class

3025
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:28,600
Not gonna lie pop rocks on the tent feel like they would be a weird experience

3026
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:31,480
I mean, it's like a whole different like

3027
02:44:32,280 --> 02:44:34,440
tingle ball game at that point

3028
02:44:35,320 --> 02:44:40,360
We could just skip the pop rocks and just spelunk a lot. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I like that idea. I like that idea

3029
02:44:40,920 --> 02:44:43,400
Speaking from experience pop rocks can burn

3030
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:49,880
Burn why would it burn because it's because of the way it reacts to the

3031
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:56,120
How unique how strange how curious all in one

3032
02:44:57,720 --> 02:44:59,720
and

3033
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:01,960
What's the point if you don't try anything

3034
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:04,680
Exactly so get naked

3035
02:45:05,160 --> 02:45:07,160
right now

3036
02:45:10,440 --> 02:45:13,320
Nice joining everything too much sugar

3037
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:20,360
I suppose sugar is granulated like that green type thing. So it's a bit sharper

3038
02:45:21,400 --> 02:45:24,360
If you want the pop rock sensation without the risk of weird

3039
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:27,560
Just have your

3040
02:45:27,960 --> 02:45:31,000
Wiefling get a mouth of sparkling water. Oh

3041
02:45:35,640 --> 02:45:38,600
Animal animal give her an animal of sparkling water

3042
02:45:39,400 --> 02:45:41,080
Oh

3043
02:45:41,080 --> 02:45:42,840
Oh

3044
02:45:42,840 --> 02:45:44,840
I'm not sure about that one chief

3045
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:47,560
Don't put sugar in there

3046
02:45:47,720 --> 02:45:49,400
All right, it'll give

3047
02:45:49,400 --> 02:45:54,680
Yeast infections. You don't want to make bread from my clam. How dare you?

3048
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:58,760
You wouldn't eat bread created by my clam. I can't believe it

3049
02:45:59,720 --> 02:46:01,720
And before anyone's like wait, what is it?

3050
02:46:03,560 --> 02:46:05,560
I'll give you a very quick 101

3051
02:46:06,440 --> 02:46:13,560
So the clam is a closed-off system in a whammon. There's no exit way except for one. Okay

3052
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:16,680
And the pH is very delicate

3053
02:46:17,640 --> 02:46:23,960
And it can create yeast now the first time you've heard yeast you've probably heard it. It's a a thing in bread

3054
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:26,040
It's what makes the dough rise. Okay

3055
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:31,560
So yes in theory you can have yeast cakes made by

3056
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:34,040
scrawny cuttles if you want, okay?

3057
02:46:34,520 --> 02:46:35,800
um

3058
02:46:35,800 --> 02:46:38,600
But I've been really lucky. I've never had one

3059
02:46:39,400 --> 02:46:40,520
um

3060
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:46,520
But it seems to be like a lottery like you just spawn in with good pey heat pH

3061
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:52,280
Balance or not and I've been super lucky and never had any issues at all like that

3062
02:46:52,840 --> 02:46:59,400
But like some poor whammon are like bro. I'm constantly like messed up and I'm like, oh, that's a shame

3063
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:02,440
Yeah

3064
02:47:02,440 --> 02:47:04,440
Like the amaranth beer possibly

3065
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:09,640
How much for the scrawny cakes I'll take a dozen

3066
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:15,720
Imagine spawning in without the free bread infinite bread glitch

3067
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:19,880
Have you never wondered why bakeries are 80 owned by women?

3068
02:47:20,680 --> 02:47:22,280
No

3069
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:29,240
Yeah, you never you never realized why women are the majority owner of bakeries. I have other business types

3070
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:42,200
Oh my god, it all makes sense now that is fell

3071
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:48,040
Oh dear god

3072
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:52,280
Put that tinfoil hat on right now, okay

3073
02:47:53,240 --> 02:47:56,040
I feel like my mind's about to be blown. Not here. I guess

3074
02:47:57,400 --> 02:47:59,400
Ten in the vein

3075
02:47:59,640 --> 02:48:02,760

02:49:58,440 --> 02:50:00,440
I'm

3099
02:50:00,840 --> 02:50:03,240
Sub-a-thon prize straw knee bread

3100
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:05,080
so

3101
02:50:05,080 --> 02:50:06,200
um

3102
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:08,120
I actually have

3103
02:50:08,120 --> 02:50:11,400
A stream coming up to discuss my dough in a thong together

3104
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:17,080
It is a private stream and if I see any leaks, we're not talking about it again because you're all in trouble. Um

3105
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:20,360
But

3106
02:50:20,360 --> 02:50:23,560
Um, I can actually make shortbread

3107
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:31,400
And it should last the the distance of like the packaging or whatever

3108
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:34,200
and

3109
02:50:34,200 --> 02:50:36,200
so

3110
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:39,160
I couldn't theory make shortbread for everyone

3111
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:42,600
I

3112
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:46,280
Sorry, I'm burping. Um, I don't know if I would have to be

3113
02:50:46,680 --> 02:50:53,960
Australia only because I don't know what the border patrol is going to be like because I swear

3114
02:50:54,520 --> 02:50:58,920
They're going to break it up and all that shit to investigate if there's something in the shortbread and it's like no

3115
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,840
Literally, I'm just leave me alone. I just wanted to make shortbread for a leaflin

3116
02:51:03,560 --> 02:51:06,280
That's so bad. I don't like to make shortbread for my own leafling

3117
02:51:08,920 --> 02:51:12,120
Bake those graham cracker breaks. No

3118
02:51:12,680 --> 02:51:16,840
Yeah, uh, I made shortbread for my dad once and it was absolutely awful

3119
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:19,320
and out of obligation

3120
02:51:19,320 --> 02:51:24,760
It was his birthday and I made him shortbread and I like dipped it in chocolate and everything

3121
02:51:25,400 --> 02:51:29,160
And I tried it and I was like this is shit and I still gave it to him anyway

3122
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:33,160
Heavily illegal anyways

3123
02:51:34,360 --> 02:51:37,080
Probably I'm like looks like I can get it very far

3124
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:41,720
That's incredibly adorable, but I'm not sure if that could be done across the globe

3125
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:44,120
Damn it. We were so close

3126
02:51:44,920 --> 02:51:46,920
That's about two levels above the bathwater

3127
02:51:47,800 --> 02:51:49,800
His papa's still a lot. Yes

3128
02:51:50,520 --> 02:51:52,280
Yes, cuttles

3129
02:51:52,280 --> 02:51:58,440
It my dad that was literally here like three weeks ago or two. Oh god. I don't know how long it's been now

3130
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,400
Yes, my dad is still bing chining. Does your mom?

3131
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:04,920
Fuck he didn't pop his clogs on the plane

3132
02:52:05,560 --> 02:52:07,560
We have to hire smugglers

3133
02:52:07,560 --> 02:52:10,600
Just to get the taste of the the scrawny shortbread

3134
02:52:12,600 --> 02:52:17,960
You still gave them to them. Oh, you mean did I kill him with it? No, it was just it wasn't very good

3135
02:52:17,960 --> 02:52:19,960
It was the first time I ever made him. It just

3136
02:52:20,680 --> 02:52:23,560
Wasn't very pleasant, but that's okay

3137
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:30,280
He'd do salt dual ornaments

3138
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:34,680
You can make Christmas tree ornaments out of food

3139
02:52:35,960 --> 02:52:41,320
Yes, Johnny dad was visiting mommy in record and finalized his gen two velar model debut stop

3140
02:52:41,720 --> 02:52:43,960
Literally nipple hire and it's my dad

3141
02:52:49,080 --> 02:52:52,360
What is smaller scrawny or her shortbread

3142
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:55,320
Shortbread is like

3143
02:52:55,800 --> 02:52:59,480
Three inches or something like that. I don't know how long shortbread is

3144
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:03,640
I'll fly to Australia to get a load worth it

3145
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:09,480
Cook and stream would be cute though. Okay. I'm down for a cooking stream at some point. I'll need to plan it out

3146
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:12,360
and

3147
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:19,000
I might make a I'll make a cooking stream and and I'll draw my gen mates on the cupcakes or something like that

3148
02:53:19,560 --> 02:53:25,080
I'll see what kind of packages like we'll use the pre-made mix. Let's be honest. It's me. Come on. It's me

3149
02:53:25,160 --> 02:53:29,480
But I'll make like cupcakes or cookies based on my gen mates and stuff

3150
02:53:30,360 --> 02:53:32,360
Because I think that would be really cute

3151
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:46,120
Hey, someone was asking for a thigh cam with three inch object shortbread's a solution pre-made still good

3152
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:51,400
How to get to Hedgeville? It's just a location on the map

3153
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:59,480
If you play for the first time you're in Lumbridge and you need to go north east a little bit and then you'll be to Hedgeville

3154
02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:02,440
If you press M it'll open up your map

3155
02:54:05,480 --> 02:54:07,480
We're almost under a thousand

3156
02:54:10,120 --> 02:54:12,120
I

3157
02:54:12,520 --> 02:54:17,800
Was gonna say teach to make tablet, but the cupcake ideas cure. No, baby

3158
02:54:19,240 --> 02:54:26,760
I might draw everyone. No strongy. Don't turn us into little bakery goods too late. You're already becoming one

3159
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:30,200
Who's making that noise?

3160
02:54:30,440 --> 02:54:32,440
You

3161
02:54:35,240 --> 02:54:40,920
How have you got that he's got like a banner and everything you can make emblems in this game

3162
02:54:43,960 --> 02:54:45,960
Oh, they're throwing snowballs at each other

3163
02:54:47,640 --> 02:54:50,520
Make a bread in the shape of your cake. Oh, yeah

3164
02:54:52,120 --> 02:54:54,760
Should I make a cake and then sit on it at the end of the stream?

3165
02:54:55,640 --> 02:55:00,840
I'm not saying that she be may or may not have done that if you're not a member of the harem

3166
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:07,640
But am I crazy enough to go through all of that time to bake all these like cupcakes and stuff

3167
02:55:07,640 --> 02:55:11,560
And then sit on a cake at the end of the stream. Yes. Yes. I am that crazy

3168
02:55:12,680 --> 02:55:14,680
Yes, I think I will do it

3169
02:55:15,240 --> 02:55:20,280
It would definitely be a next month stream because this month I'm pretty stacked out the wazoo with everything

3170
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:23,560
I have to like plan everything like hella in advance because I was trying to

3171
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:29,640
If you do an epi higher do sin's mum

3172
02:55:31,640 --> 02:55:33,640
Her mum

3173
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:37,080
Honestly, her mum's a hurt in a hole. Thank you tiny spiny

3174
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:40,280
sin's mum

3175
02:55:41,080 --> 02:55:43,080
Which would be I think she would be done for it. Um

3176
02:55:43,800 --> 02:55:50,120
Oh, no, I think sin's mum has the same problem as my dad where it's legal name and legal address

3177
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:52,760
draft

3178
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:54,760
draft

3179
02:55:54,760 --> 02:56:00,200
We still don't know since mum is single by the way. I don't know. It's been in many a year

3180
02:56:01,400 --> 02:56:03,400
Times have changed. I don't know

3181
02:56:04,600 --> 02:56:07,480
Wait, what was that? It was me laughing out of the blue

3182
02:56:08,920 --> 02:56:12,280
Maybe sit on clay and let the shape harden so we have solid proof of that

3183
02:56:14,120 --> 02:56:17,800
What happens if I do it and then you can see the wrinkles of my starfish

3184
02:56:18,760 --> 02:56:21,400
Oh, oh wait. No, wait, I can't sit on it

3185
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:24,600
Without any cleason

3186
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:30,520
Oh my god, we're about to do it. We're about to go under a thousand wines

3187
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:36,440
I can't freaking believe it my childhood dream

3188
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:42,440
My childhood dream of getting a freaking skill. Okay. No, I don't need to go get a bond

3189
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:46,040
Should I go get the bond now?

3190
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:48,760
I don't know

3191
02:56:49,080 --> 02:56:53,640
I don't know. We're like we buy the cape or anything. Oh, sorry. I'm walking away. Sorry. I just got excited

3192
02:56:53,640 --> 02:56:59,480
I just really wanted to check out the the woodsmanship the craftsmanship on that. What the table?

3193
02:57:02,840 --> 02:57:07,240
If you do sit on it when equals on then you'd have a caked up cake afterwards

3194
02:57:07,800 --> 02:57:11,720
Maybe I should sit on it on stream with close and then after stream

3195
02:57:11,960 --> 02:57:13,960
I

3196
02:57:19,400 --> 02:57:23,160
Keepers nearby, okay, I'll let the reef one

3197
02:57:25,400 --> 02:57:28,440
The cooking guilders right by the Grand Exchange that where I get my cake

3198
02:57:30,760 --> 02:57:35,480
Next the more needs to be a reef on anything we were gonna see if we can get a cat or more approved

3199
02:57:35,640 --> 02:57:37,640
But I don't know if it's gonna get removed

3200
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:40,360
We are here fellow reeflings to experience this moment

3201
02:57:41,960 --> 02:57:46,680
We're getting there. We're getting there. Oh my god. There is 900s unbelievable

3202
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:49,640

80,000 wait, how many what 40 more batches and then that's it. We're done. So

3204
02:57:59,320 --> 02:58:05,640
I'm not late and I know you're literally right on time. We've just gone below a thousand wine mark

3205
02:58:05,880 --> 02:58:10,760
We're doing it. We're actually

3206
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:13,320
factually

3207
02:58:13,320 --> 02:58:19,400
Getting it. Mummy's saying in tea. Mummy's saying some teasers are the doughnuts. I'm gonna be so empty

3208
02:58:20,920 --> 02:58:25,320
Because I'm doing all like all I'm saying is the cake sitting stream can be a haha youtube thing but then

3209
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:30,280
peeling off the shorts and eating the frosting part will be a

3210
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:34,520
Wait, what? I wouldn't eat my own cake. What?

3211
02:58:35,640 --> 02:58:37,640
I

3212
02:58:39,160 --> 02:58:44,360
Was it I was gonna take the shorts off and then sit on the cake and take a picture

3213
02:58:47,240 --> 02:58:53,400
We're gonna get drained in more way than just money stop you make me sound like fendom or something nonsense like that

3214
02:58:54,440 --> 02:58:59,320
Now I um, I hope that the doughnuts on

3215
02:59:00,440 --> 02:59:01,480
or

3216
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:03,480
rather fair I need to

3217
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:11,640
Swap a few things on azuras and then check out what she's comfortable with with the price like the rewards for support

3218
02:59:12,120 --> 02:59:14,120
And if that's all good

3219
02:59:15,160 --> 02:59:20,200
We'll keep it up because then I will work with she be on hers and then mine obviously I get to like fully

3220
02:59:20,920 --> 02:59:25,800
I don't really dictate. I just tell the girls like this is what I think is good and we can either say yes or no

3221
02:59:25,960 --> 02:59:28,760
Or they can completely make it up on their own. That's up to them as well

3222
02:59:29,720 --> 02:59:31,720
and

3223
02:59:32,120 --> 02:59:37,720
When the blue streams start we are gonna die if these youtube streams are anything to go by

3224
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:41,240
um

3225
02:59:41,960 --> 02:59:43,960
No, no fendom not fendom

3226
02:59:44,680 --> 02:59:49,400
Fendom's the other one that she's a dome fish have fins hence fendom. No

3227
02:59:51,240 --> 02:59:53,800
Oh my god, we're about to be 800

3228
02:59:54,680 --> 03:00:01,560
Oh, this is gonna go by so quick. I can't believe it. Oh my god. I can't believe it. I've never been this far away

3229
03:00:01,720 --> 03:00:03,720
from

3230
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:12,600
I can't believe we're doing it

3231
03:00:13,960 --> 03:00:15,960
We're doing it 800 already

3232
03:00:16,440 --> 03:00:22,440
I'm gonna take it from the berries that is what we're at because I actually don't know what one it is, but yeah

3233
03:00:25,320 --> 03:00:30,120
Oh my god, and then you guys need to take me to the grand exchange to get me a bond

3234
03:00:30,840 --> 03:00:32,840
And then you guys need to

3235
03:00:33,480 --> 03:00:35,480
take me

3236
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:41,640
To the cape and then I'll go buy a cape. I need to take money out as well. Don't don't let me forget

3237
03:00:41,960 --> 03:00:43,960
I can't take not to take money out

3238
03:00:45,480 --> 03:00:50,360
How much does it cost for an outing and cooking wine? You have extra maybe only 400 more?

3239
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Wait real answer

3240
03:00:53,720 --> 03:00:58,120
Uh all the reeflings gave me wines and grapes. I didn't even have to

3241
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:01,080
Do anything for it

3242
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:04,120
What's this?

3243
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:07,400
There's a bank inside the gills. It's okay if you forgot

3244
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:14,760
Don't worry mommy will take care of you. Thank you

3245
03:01:18,120 --> 03:01:20,120
It's the number that matters, okay

3246
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:22,520
It's inside

3247
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:30,040
My friend oh wait the wines aren't popping so I actually don't know what it is

3248
03:01:32,360 --> 03:01:33,480
Uh

3249
03:01:33,480 --> 03:01:38,760
Can't wait to follow mommy in another site where she can start tonight. Yes the starting screen said

3250
03:01:39,560 --> 03:01:41,880
There's no starting screen. I'm just straight up

3251
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:47,240
You know, you know in a little dj session

3252
03:01:48,120 --> 03:01:52,760
Okay, I'm gonna let these wines pop and see what we're at

3253
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:58,120
Uh because I'm not sure what the deal is

3254
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:08,120
It would be a two minute long stream literally the post yeah, right

3255
03:02:08,120 --> 03:02:11,960
I'm gonna let these wines pop because I don't know what we're looking at

3256
03:02:12,680 --> 03:02:16,200
This is six day the wines are about to pop here pop

3257
03:02:18,120 --> 03:02:25,080
Okay, okay a few more a few more a few more batches. Don't don't get in over your head yet. Don't get cocky a few more batches

3258
03:02:28,440 --> 03:02:31,720
A russian at the finish line again, and who's gonna stop me?

3259
03:02:34,040 --> 03:02:36,040
I like it quick

3260
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:42,760
Mommy getting down to business it's gonna be a fun two minute stream. Thank you. Yes, it is it will be

3261
03:02:43,400 --> 03:02:48,520
Now there's gonna be a lot of yapping. I'll see what happens if I get too shy or nervous or whatever

3262
03:02:52,840 --> 03:02:55,160
At least east is into it like try some pork leg

3263
03:02:56,600 --> 03:03:00,280
I thought about doing a hand cam where I would

3264
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:03,400
Visually instruct you on what to do

3265
03:03:05,960 --> 03:03:07,960
Um

3266
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:14,040
But it would be hard to do that and myself so that's not possible it would have to be like a

3267
03:03:15,560 --> 03:03:17,560
Follow along on them

3268
03:03:18,440 --> 03:03:21,720
I'm happy to chill even without the other stuff

3269
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:31,400
Mommy explaining how to sit in your

3270
03:03:32,120 --> 03:03:39,080
Okay, actually, I'm not sure now. Oh, you want to do the west bank for me to 200

3271
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:42,600
Wiki isn't specifying

3272
03:03:42,920 --> 03:03:46,760
I can't believe that the runescape wiki how old is this game and the wiki isn't specific

3273
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:53,160
Ink and chill honestly at least wine and dinosaurs before you take our ink and a lot of after gear, please. I'll cry otherwise

3274
03:03:54,600 --> 03:03:56,600
I'll cry too

3275
03:03:56,600 --> 03:03:59,080
Don't worry. We'll both be crying together but

3276
03:04:01,480 --> 03:04:03,480
Those slacks we are for each other

3277
03:04:07,800 --> 03:04:08,840
Mommy

3278
03:04:08,840 --> 03:04:14,360
I'm gonna go the first two minutes of the steam and then it's the ink clary gonna yap to us probably

3279
03:04:14,920 --> 03:04:19,880
I mean I said I was gonna play the coffin at Andy and Lele. I might just play it like on youtube

3280
03:04:19,880 --> 03:04:22,200
But um, it looks like a hoot and holler

3281
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:24,760
um

3282
03:04:24,920 --> 03:04:28,040
I don't know if I could get another reach of her to come read it with me

3283
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:33,880
Or if it's better experience though, I think the experience might be better though. I don't know

3284
03:04:39,320 --> 03:04:41,320
I'm not sure

3285
03:04:47,560 --> 03:04:53,960
Plain echo para is that even stream safe with chocolate and vanilla

3286
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:05,320
You arrive just on time as per the script you stop the

3287
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:08,440
Aftercare

3288
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:12,760
The stream version of oh, there's a stream version of neko para. I don't know that

3289
03:05:13,800 --> 03:05:18,760
Uh, maybe you know, fuck it. Maybe we should maybe I'll get another v8 come another

3290
03:05:19,640 --> 03:05:21,880
The reach of her to come on

3291
03:05:22,680 --> 03:05:24,680
With neko para with me. Why not?

3292
03:05:25,640 --> 03:05:30,760
I can't believe people think she's really getting a 99. Whoa. Why are you down in me? How are you down in me?

3293
03:05:30,760 --> 03:05:35,800
I'm literally 27 xp off like how can there even be any doubters at this point

3294
03:05:38,360 --> 03:05:42,680
Steam not stream. Oh, sorry. There's a steam version is safe

3295
03:05:45,960 --> 03:05:49,880
Technically if you don't pay you can only play another reach of her to come on

3296
03:05:50,360 --> 03:05:52,360
Stop stop stop

3297

So you admit there is a check that is not paid late. So you're saying there's a check

Up and then sure add five percent on it. No, that's ridiculous. Don't do that add one. No

3408
03:14:05,320 --> 03:14:07,960
Add like that two percent increase. Why not?

3409
03:14:08,920 --> 03:14:10,920
The offer does that do anything?

3410
