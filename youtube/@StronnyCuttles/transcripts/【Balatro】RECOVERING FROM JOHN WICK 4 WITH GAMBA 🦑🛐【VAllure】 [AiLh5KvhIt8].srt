1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,760
It's really bizarre for a full minute, no one can hear me, but then it's fine, I don't

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
know.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
It's rather bizarre.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
Rather bizarre indeed.

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,360
Oh my God, I got so many comments on my YouTube.

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Hold on a minute.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,160
It's just so over for the moment.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm spilling.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Okay.

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
Wait, hold on.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
The frickin' Reflins joined membership.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Hold on a minute.

13
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Link322 and Stalkin.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Thank you for the memberships.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,160
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,160
Can you guys finally see me?

17
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Is it going to register that you guys can see?

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Oh thank goodness.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
It takes so long for that, right?

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Reflins, Reflins, Reflins.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,160
I know normally at any minute we're throwing fists, we're fighting.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,160
I have a very serious, very incredibly.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,560
This is life or death for my channel.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm not being funny.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,560
This is life or death for my channel.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
What pose?

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,560
What pose do you want me pregnant with you?

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,560
What pose do you want to be in my tummy in?

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
This is life or death.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Life or death for this channel.

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,560
This channel will pivot and not survive if we do not do this.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Hold on.

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm opening up a poll.

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Hold on.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Hold the phone.

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,560
I'm opening up a poll as we speak.

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I will change the thumbnail soon TM, but it is so important.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Hold on.

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
Poll.

40
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,560
Start poll.

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,560
What pose for you in my tum tum in my tum tum?

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,560
As I spelled that terribly wrong, tum tum.

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Pose one.

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Pose two.

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
That's right.

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Don't ever say.

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Don't ever say you don't eat well at VEAL or headquarters.

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
I don't want to hear it.

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I don't want to hear it.

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,560
How am I making this worse?

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Literally, you decide the fate of my channel with this one pose alone.

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
Go.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
What pose for you in my tum tum?

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,560
You must vote.

55
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Four.

56
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
Phil Nelson.

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,560
I mean, your technicals can be extended, but the Phil Nelson.

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,560
You get too early to do the poll.

59
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,560
More people need to join the stream.

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,560
I mean, I stream every single time, at the same time every day.

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Bar one day before anyone's like,

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Actually, you were the last bell to stream.

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
You were two hours late.

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Actually, no.

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,560
I was doing a meeting and everyone's happy and the marshmallows are coming back.

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,560
So if you want to send any nice marshmallows to the girls, please be my guest.

67
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Be my guest.

68
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Be my guest.

69
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
My guest.

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,560
You're welcome to be my guest.

71
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Let's see.

72
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
Let's see.

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
This is what you're drinking.

74
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Cola.

75
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Oh, it's cola.

76
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Wait, is it vote?

77
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Whoa, we have a unanimous, unanimous vote of pose three.

78
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,560
I will relay that to the artist as we speak.

79
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:53,560
The reeflings have kindly decided that pose three is the most voted for by far.

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,560
I would love to see that pose further developed for this commission.

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Thank you so much for working so quickly.

82
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Because I didn't realise I was going to get an update so quickly on these options.

83
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
I didn't even know I was going to get options.

84
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
I sent away a little reference sheet.

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Do you want to see the reference sheet?

86
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
It's pretty funny.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Right, sorry.

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,560
The reeflings have kindly decided that pose three is the most voted for by far.

89
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,560
I would love to see that pose further developed in this commission.

90
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Thank you so much for working on these options and giving me choices.

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,560
This has been a fantastic experience so far.

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,560
I am very lucky to have found you as an artist.

93
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,560
And before anyone's like, oh, your voice sounds sarcastic when you're typing that.

94
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
No, I mean it.

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,560
This is what I sent away.

96
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,560
I did not expect at all to get...

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Hold on, so that's the image there.

98
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,560
I did not at all expect to get opportunities to even pick a pose further than what I had submitted.

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Where the fuck is the image that I just saved?

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Oh no. Where is it?

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Hold on a minute.

102
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Save image as on desktop is...

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,560
It's on the desktop. I can see it when I go to save it again.

104
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
There we go.

105
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
This is what I sent away the reference as.

106
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
This is what...

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,560
How else end that pose?

108
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Good morning.

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
That's what I sent away.

110
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Come on, don't laugh.

111
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
I was like, oh come on, got my little reefling.

112
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
We got our little placenta line going.

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
So placenta actually attaches...

114
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,560
I think the placenta sits at any part of the wall in theory.

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
It can go anywhere.

116
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
And I was like, did we put it at the top of the womb?

117
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
And I was like, you know what?

118
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
No, it can attach at any point.

119
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,560
So we'll just do a straight line coming from my wee reefling.

120
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,560
But yeah, that's the reference I sent away.

121
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,560
And then they very, very kindly gave us those four options.

122
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Those three options, pardon.

123
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,560
And then, yeah, you guys picked three.

124
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,560
So I'm gonna be pregnant with you.

125
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Are you ready to be in my tummy?

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
I was gonna write the script together.

127
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,560
And then I can say all the adorable things.

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
I also caught up with my dad and told him how awesome you guys are.

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
And I was like, dad, guess who played Microsoft?

130
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,560
And he was like, shut the front door.

131
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
And I was like, hell, yeah, I didn't.

132
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,560
And I told, I was like, I was telling him about how you used to absolutely wreck and deck.

133
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Also, apparently our Canadian pot smoker isn't called grizzle.

134
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
It's gristle. Oops.

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
So it's gristle.

136
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,560
If you're out there, one Canadian gristle.

137
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Sorry, I've got your gamer tag wrong.

138
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,560
My dad was, oh, he should have seen the disgust on his face when I was like,

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,560
oh, I gave a shout out to gristle and everything.

140
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,560
And he was, oh, oh, wrong gamer tag.

141
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,560
Oh, sorry. I wasn't even like two years old at this point.

142
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Like, oh, sorry.

143
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
Close enough.

144
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Did you tell him we're getting top seven?

145
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
He was laughing at that so hard.

146
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
He was like, wait, because no one submitted for it.

147
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
And I was like, yeah, because it's such an old game.

148
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,560
But I told him we made VTuber history because I'm the first VTuber to play Microsoft.

149
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Like 99.9% sure.

150
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
Unless there's some obscure person hidden in the YouTube algorithm,

151
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
we made VTuber history by being the first person to play Microsoft.

152
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
So, feels good, man.

153
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
I also told them that I've not submitted my note.

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
I should though, just for the hell of it.

155
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Fuck it. I will. I will. I'll do it after the stream because this is a cool downstream.

156
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,560
If you didn't know, we're not actually playing

157
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Cooking Simulator

158
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,560
or Women Simulator, whatever you want to call it, your choice.

159
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I may or may not be absolutely distraught.

160
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,560
I'm actually going to update the stream thumbnail right now

161
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,560
because I think people generally think I'm sitting on...

162
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Oh, if you heard that.

163
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Oh, my PC didn't like that.

164
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Right, let's pop away the pregnancy for now.

165
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Because I've got something else I want to show you.

166
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,560
Because the streams start coming and they don't stop coming

167
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,560
and the streams start coming and they don't stop coming

168
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,560
and they beg to the room and they hit the ground running.

169
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Didn't make sense not to stretch the bandwidth

170
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,560
because we keep on gaming, but we keep on gaming.

171
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,560
So much to do, so much to see, so much to game, so much to do, so much to game.

172
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Mate, the name of this stream is going to be recovering from

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,560
John Wick for Wiccamba.

174
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Remember that time? Do you remember what happened yesterday?

175
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Yeah, I remember. I still remember.

176
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Very vividly what happened.

177
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Not to be confused with vividly, oh, some more, the streamer.

178
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Okay, that should update.

179
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
I hope it has felt cultural, right?

180
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Yes, we are going to start the GamerScore grind.

181
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
So, things are going to...

182
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,560
We're going to start doing the Xbox GamerScore grind,

183
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
starting off with Cameo.

184
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Now, I know we've still got Binding of Isaac tomorrow

185
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
and a membership stream of Iron Man.

186
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,560
Guinness, I'm not going to greet during that.

187
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,560
My eyes are still puffy.

188
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Those window noises jump-scared me.

189
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
I'm sorry, it was me, it was me.

190
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
My PC doesn't like when I download an image for some reason.

191
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,560
It gets all up its arse.

192
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Honestly, it gets its wee panties and leaves in the cliffs

193
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
and I'm like, hmm, it needs to be with me.

194
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,560
But yes, we're going to try Stray.

195
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Apparently, it's five hours long.

196
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Cameo is roughly eight hours split,

197
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,560
so I'm going to try and be a bit easier on myself

198
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
with these endurance streams,

199
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
especially because there's a few things...

200
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Oh, a secret.

201
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Thank you for the five gifted memberships.

202
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Congrats to those who caught it with their face.

203
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Make sure to interact with chat

204
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
because I think there's a prompt that says

205
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
to accept GIFs on channels for some reason.

206
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
It just doesn't happen automatically.

207
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
I don't know.

208
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:45,560
But, yes, what am I doing?

209
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
I don't know.

210
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
Oh my God, it's officially...

211
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Hold on, wait.

212
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
I might even have a further thing to show you

213
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560
if I have it, if it's lurking in the shadows.

214
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Yes, there is...

215
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Oh, I do have it, I do have it.

216
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Okay, you might hear the windows sound.

217
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
It's my computer, not yours.

218
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
It's my computer.

219
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Okay, it's my computer.

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
One last thing to show you,

221
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,560
and then we'll get Gambon to make myself feel better.

222
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Wow, I've spoken like a true addict.

223
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Holy crap.

224
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,560
It has been...

225
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
Why is it locked?

226
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
Unlock yourself right now.

227
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,560
It has been almost one month of streams,

228
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
and here we are, a little refluence.

229
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Here we are.

230
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
Can you tell?

231
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,560
I like streaming, question mark.

232
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,560
I'll swap out the runescape key.

233
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
But it's been one month.

234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
I'm going to tweet this out.

235
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm going to tweet it out with my YouTube statistics

236
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
and just be like, thank you for anyone

237
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,560
and everyone who interacted with me.

238
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,560
It has been nothing short of a complete pleasure

239
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,560
to be able to do this.

240
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Nothing short of a complete pleasure,

241
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,560
pure happiness, pure, pure vibes,

242
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
whatever you want to call it.

243
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
It has been nothing but fantastic.

244
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm very happy.

245
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Those are all the streams.

246
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,560
I will swap out the part five for my new one

247
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,560
because technically I didn't do the part five runescape.

248
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,560
But yes, we are in, please do not be mistaken

249
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
in thinking that, oh no, it's going to slow down now.

250
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

251
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Mommy built different.

252
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I can't believe it's already been a dad stream

253
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,560
more than some streamers in a year, be honest.

254
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Hold on, let me take a drink of cola

255
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,560
and then let me finish off my tea.

256
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,560
But yes, I have had an absolutely fantastic month.

257
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
I'm sure all the girls will absolutely agree

258
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,560
and say we've had just beyond immeasurable

259
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
happiness success.

260
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
When I go off of stream, like once I finish this stream,

261
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
everyone's debut highlights are going up as well.

262
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,560
I'm going to put some advertising money back

263
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,560
and behind it as well just to help the girls out

264
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,560
with their growth because I've got a goal

265
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
for them to achieve this month

266
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
and obviously I need to enable them.

267
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
I need to enable their human, I was going to say

268
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
I was going to say humidities

269
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,560
for the implication of cookies.

270
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
I don't know why.

271
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
It only goes even faster from here.

272
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
The second thumbnail exposing VLR.

273
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Oh, did you like it?

274
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Thanks, I made it myself.

275
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm just so good.

276
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I'm just so MLG Pro, honestly.

277
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Oh, that's my game capture, please don't.

278
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Wait, my game capture is in mine.

279
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
It's because I'm dumb.

280
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,560
But yes, it's been a fantastic month.

281
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Next month, I'm going to be pregnant with you in my belly.

282
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Next month, my...

283
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Right, actually hold on, hold on, let's discuss this.

284
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,560
While we're busy fighting and off all the time,

285
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,560
I actually do need to discuss the length of streams

286
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,560
coming up in Dru...

287
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Where the frick?

288
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,560
I now have two of these.

289
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Am I okay?

290
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
I don't think so.

291
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Okay, well, if it's that one,

292
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,560
right, we need to discuss

293
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
or we need to bring about.

294
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
So my dad's coming over, I'm not hitting the fact.

295
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
My dad's coming.

296
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
My dad's coming to see me.

297
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
So, why does time go faster every year?

298
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
Isn't that not like a relatively...

299
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Fainting the finished Elden Ring DLC?

300
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Oh yeah, you're going to carry me later when we play it again.

301
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560
I've never played Spiral.

302
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,560
I think I might have played it as a child,

303
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
but I do not remember it.

304
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
I think maybe my dad played it, but even he said,

305
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
like, I'm not even sure about that.

306
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
And I'm like, maybe I just made it up

307
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
and watched people play it as a child.

308
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,560
Your dad, yeah, you're going to meet your father-in-law.

309
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
I'm not sure.

310
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
I might bring him on stream for like five seconds,

311
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
but all you're going to hear is

312
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
for the love of effing God.

313
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Do not say my legal name, my name is Strani.

314
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Okay, don't say anything.

315
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
And he'll be like, hi, Radish boys.

316
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
And I'm like, no, they're called Raeflings, dad!

317
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Raeflings!

318
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Mail on stream.

319
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Oh, for fuck's sake.

320
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Then he start mail on stream if it's my dad.

321
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,560
I will fucking have a riot.

322
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,560
If someone fucking goes mail on stream,

323
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,560
drop, because my fucking dad shows up on stream.

324
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Oh my God, I'm fighting phantoms right now.

325
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
I'm ready to swing on my chair.

326
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
I'm fighting phantoms.

327
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Lou phantoms dans ma chambre.

328
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Chambre, fuck.

329
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Man, I'm such a fake Frenchie.

330
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
New nickname, we're Radish boys.

331
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
It was your old nickname.

332
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
It was your old nickname

333
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
when you were in the cryo pod,

334
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
but now you're called Raeflings, r-e-e-e-e.

335
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
Raeflings.

336
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Already fighting them visibly,

337
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
but literally the phantom's in my room right now.

338
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
The phantom's dans ma chambre,

339
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
in my room, in my bedroom,

340
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
and to be specific.

341
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,560
Mmm.

342
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Yes, but for the next

343
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
three weeks,

344
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
ash,

345
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
there's not going to be too many

346
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
endurance streams, because

347
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
so my dad said the first few days

348
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
he's going to not even be

349
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
on the same time zone.

350
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
I don't even know if he's going to be awake.

351
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
He's probably going to be awake while I'm streaming.

352
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Oh my God, oh he's going to be here

353
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
and has like all our ridiculous conversations.

354
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Um, but it's fine.

355
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
It's fine.

356
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
My dad laughs

357
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
and he finds it funny.

358
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
You can just pre-record a segment.

359
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Probably. The phantom's have got

360
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
to fight my mental illness.

361
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,560
Bro, I'm pheromone maxing right now.

362
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I'm fucking disgusting. I'm so greasy.

363
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
I smell V.O.

364
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
I was going to have a shower

365
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
after John went.

366
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Uh, the reason why I don't have any news

367
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
other than what I've just shown

368
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
is because I did nothing yesterday

369
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
after the stream. I was so distraught.

370
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
I was so distraught. I didn't have

371
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
a shower. I went to bed.

372
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
I had a nap. I woke up.

373
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
I ended up binging to

374
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
TikTok for four hours.

375
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Um, I'm literally pheromone maxing

376
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
right now and then I went back to sleep

377
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
because I felt so bad after

378
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
watching that film.

379
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Uh,

380
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
so let's just say no emotional

381
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
films. No films I have any

382
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
emotional little

383
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
things.

384
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Literally I didn't even eat. I've still not eaten

385
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
since I had the past, was it

386
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
pasta? Left over pasta with you

387
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
yesterday. On Rinscape

388
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
that's the last time I've eaten because I've

389
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
been so distraught.

390
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm such a cry baby.

391
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I can't even eat.

392
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Um,

393
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
no I'm not even hungry. That's the thing.

394
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Thank you Jake Norman for coming

395
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
out. Member!

396
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Uh, our membership streams for the week.

397
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Classic script writing. You guys are going to tell me what you want to hear again.

398
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
We're going to do a

399
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
the plot has already been picked out slightly.

400
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Um, it's going to be a choose your own

401
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
adventure kind of plot.

402
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
But we will be

403
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
publicly writing

404
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
ASMR collabs with

405
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
VR.

406
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
I have five one-on-one collabs planned

407
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
with the girls. I'm not even told the girls yet.

408
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Uh, I'm just doing it. I'm just bombing into their DMs

409
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
being like hey, how's it going?

410
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Actually, out of raw

411
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
curiosity did that Rinscape stream

412
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
get limited ads for

413
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
the language I was using

414
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
because there was no in-game audio or voices.

415
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Wow!

416
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
My John Wick stream was fine.

417
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
I literally constantly went

418
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
and said

419
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
pretty

420
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
pretty outrageous stuff.

421
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Not going to lie.

422
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
The banks were mentioned at one point

423
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
and then the banks became the high table.

424
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
So from now on

425
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
the high table is how we

426
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
reference the banks, okay?

427
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Um,

428
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
eat when you're ready and hungry.

429
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Yeah.

430
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
I'm fine. No, no, that's fine.

431
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
She's sad girl Maxine for real, for real.

432
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Um, if you

433
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
didn't make it for yesterday's stream

434
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
um,

435
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
I want to say John Wick

436
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
spoilers.

437
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Maybe?

438
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
Uh, is it for the first 30 minutes

439
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
you're not allowed to say anything bad? Well, I'm pretty sure

440
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
like I was just straight out coming out

441
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
with the sentences like we should be

442
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
where the banks and stuff and I'm like

443
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
hold on a minute, isn't usually going to have problems

444
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
with us?

445
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Yeah, I think I know.

446
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm going to finish that

447
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
in the movie. I had to put, oh.

448
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Okay, I'm not spoiling nothing.

449
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
If you've not watched John Wick

450
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
if you've not

451
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
watched John Wick, you're welcome to watch me

452
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
um, create

453
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Wines whilst watching the movie.

454
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Um, do not whatever you do

455
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
up to the end of the VOD

456
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
for any reason, even though

457
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
the movie isn't displayed in the stream

458
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
uh, you'll be able to hear in my voice

459
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
what happened.

460
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Uh, should know. Don't, don't do that.

461
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't do that. Uh, yes. So there's going to be

462
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
a few shorter streams but

463
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
with these shorter streams that are coming up in

464
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
July there's going to be a lot more

465
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
consistency, I repeat a lot more

466
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
consistency with ASMR uploads.

467
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
So it's like a reward

468
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
less mummy equals more mummy

469
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
more mummy equals less mummy.

470
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Yeah?

471
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
That makes sense.

472
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
There's the, there's more of me.

473
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
There's, okay, this, I don't know

474
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
why this didn't pop, but here we go.

475
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Re-roll the shop a total of

476
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
100 times and we've got Re-rolls

477
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
cost 2 bucks left. Didn't we not already have

478
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
that?

479
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Play a total of 300. Wait, why is

480
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
this popping now? Re-face

481
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
all, uh

482
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
Re-triggers all played face cards.

483
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
That's a curious one.

484
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
That could be used in combination.

485
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Spend a total of 2.5 in the shops.

486
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Woah!

487
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
One extra card slot

488
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
available in the shop. That's curious.

489
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
It doesn't make sense, but more mummy

490
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
means more happy. Yes, there's a

491
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,560
few things I wish to execute this month.

492
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Wow, uh, as an

493
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
execute plans, not as an execute

494
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
the high table.

495
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,560
Um,

496
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,560
planets appear 4 times more

497
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
likely. Buy a total.

498
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Okay. Wow!

499
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Jeez, Louise!

500
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
First thing in the morning

501
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
you want to do that to me? Right.

502
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Dev's getting a message right now.

503
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
Dev's getting a message. Continue!

504
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,560
Oh, uh, I think

505
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,560
this is, uh, yeah, we've got our token.

506
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
We've got our token.

507
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Um, we won, we won, we won.

508
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
That's the main thing. Okay.

509
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
Well, actually, I've got a f***ing force behind me.

510
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
So today we're having an easy day.

511
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
When I get off stream, all the girls are going to have

512
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
highlights, um,

513
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
uploaded, debut highlights

514
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
uploaded to their channel.

515
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm also going to put some advertisement in it.

516
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Uh, I'm not putting any advertisement

517
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
in me. This is actually just straight up

518
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
internal veiler.

519
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
This is just straight up veiler

520
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
internal communications.

521
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
I don't put advertisements on my content,

522
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
but I put it on the girls' content

523
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
because I want to push them, not me.

524
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
This is just straight up comms. I need to shut the f*** up.

525
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I'm, like, literally, uh,

526
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
a nightmare. Hold on. I did not

527
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
read what this

528
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
pack had. Hold on.

529
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Oh no, what's

530
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
going with my Wii game?

531
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Have I broken it?

532
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
Oh no.

533
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
Prevents death of chip scored

534
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
are at least 24 of the required.

535
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
It's just still...

536
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Oh wow.

537
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
What's...

538
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Okay, I think it's having a wee

539
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
melty, but that's okay. You're looking to have a melty.

540
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Yo, look, it's

541
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
shiny. Just shows her backdoor,

542
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
honestly. Tire cards appear four times more

543
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
frequently. Okay.

544
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Discover 25 blinds.

545
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Okay. Re-roll boss blinds.

546
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Unlimited times. Okay, okay.

547
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Right, um, I'm actually going to have

548
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
to exit this run,

549
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
uh, because I didn't pay attention to what

550
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
the deck was. Hold on. Let's check...

551
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Let's check out the deck rolls.

552
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,560
New run. At

553
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,560
end of each round, $2

554
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
per remaining hand,

555
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,560
$1 per discard, so

556
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,560
no interest. So there's no point in holding

557
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
on to economy on the green deck.

558
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Curious.

559
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Initial cards and booster packs are

560
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
free. That could definitely

561
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
throw us ahead quite

562
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
quite

563
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
a lot.

564
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
That's going to throw us ahead quite a lot, so

565
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm going to take it, because we are... was it

566
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
10, 9, 8, 7, 6

567
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
straight.

568
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
Well, if the girl succeeds, you succeed. Yes.

569
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,560
I...

570
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
I've kind of touched up on this.

571
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
I have done everything I want to

572
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
do. Um,

573
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,560
I'm just happy to be back. I'm happy to be

574
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
making content, following my goofy ideas.

575
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
I mean, like, hell, who the fuck thinks

576
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
of pregnancy ASMR?

577
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Um, like,

578
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
I just want to do that kind of stuff.

579
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Like, that's where my focus is.

580
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
And making, like, funny shorts

581
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
and having a good time. Like, that's

582
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
where it's... that's what it's

583
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,560
all about. Earn a dollar for each

584
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
nine in your full deck. That's so specific.

585
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Right, two booster cards.

586
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,560
What's the dealio? What's the dealio?

587
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
A straight...

588
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
What?

589
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Four plus multiplier

590
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
for each card.

591
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Below?

592
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
What does that mean?

593
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
So...

594
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,560
So, I can't use that one.

595
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Uh...

596
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
If I play a straight... I mean...

597
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
You want

598
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
to cut cards. It's good for a thin deck.

599
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

600
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

601
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

602
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Yeah, you got a thin deck.

603
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Yeah, that joker is in...

604
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Um, removing cards is actually

605
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
good.

606
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
I don't have death, though.

607
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
I don't know, maybe three

608
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
times multiplier for a straight, though.

609
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
I think if we could grab

610
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
that voucher that has

611
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,560
the...

612
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
one, two, skip a few.

613
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
I want one, two,

614
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,560
skip a few.

615
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Yeah.

616
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Reminder, there's no point

617
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
of holding on to economy. I'm sure

618
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I just... three times multiplier

619
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
is insane.

620
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Oh wait, multiplier at the end?

621
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Well, not that the rest even affect it.

622
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Yeah,

623
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,560
simplifying your deck for consistency

624
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
is a way for a better run. Me who just

625
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,560
fucking picked that order. Okay,

626
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
well, I've done it now.

627
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
The pillar, cards played previously

628
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
or debuff, that's fine.

629
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Right, a straight.

630
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
An ace,

631
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
a king, a queen, a jack

632
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,560
and a ten.

633
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Oh my god, what?

634
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
That's so weird.

635
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Oh, you just do that then

636
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
and throw away the ace.

637
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
You're going for

638
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
straights during Pride Month?

639
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
Damn straight ass.

640
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
That's terrible. Don't laugh at that.

641
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
That's terrible.

642
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Kings and queens.

643
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Full house, kings and queens.

644
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Okay.

645
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
That was a joke, by the way. Relax

646
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
snowflake, it's called humor.

647
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Relax.

648
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Okay, the straights aren't going very well.

649
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
What do you do?

650
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Bakes?

651
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Right, let's try and get

652
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
a few...

653
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
Let me get a few high

654
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
high straights.

655
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Wait, what's a straight again?

656
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
It's when it goes one, two, three, four.

657
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Five. Yeah, because when it's a flush

658
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
it's all the same color. Yeah, okay.

659
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
I got it, I got it, I got it.

660
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Hi, thank you for joining.

661
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Thank you for anyone for showing up.

662
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I do understand that I stream a bit extreme.

663
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
I stream a bit extreme.

664
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
I don't know, do we just... how much should we go?

665
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
320 blazer.

666
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
I mean, we could just get rid of these

667
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
and then throw that four away

668
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
and see what happens.

669
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
I think we're going to make it. Hold on, how much money do we get?

670
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
I have made a great

671
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
human error.

672
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Oh lord, I have made a great

673
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
human error.

674
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
What do I need? A queen? I only have

675
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
one more queen in the deck.

676
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
I have made

677
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
a great error.

678
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
What do I need? A

679
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
10 and a queen.

680
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
That's an eight and a six.

681
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Wait, so I need a seven. What are seven?

682
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Okay, the odds of me pulling a seven are so high.

683
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Nine, seven, eight,

684
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
six, five.

685
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
Discard and pray.

686
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
Oh my god, I've completely messed up.

687
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,560
I have to get rid of this.

688
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm sorry, I do.

689
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
I have to get rid of the high.

690
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
I don't have much highs. The odds of

691
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
I was going to say the odds of highs are so rubbish.

692
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Okay, 10, nine,

693
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
eight, seven, six,

694
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
zero.

695
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Okay. That was pure

696
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
probability. That was pure probability.

697
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Please, can we get the Joker that does that

698
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
thing where it does the thing?

699
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
That would be great.

700
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Okay, we are going to...

701
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
Oh, that's not bad.

702
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
That's not bad. Retriggers all face cards.

703
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
So if I happen to get a flush with a face,

704
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
a target card and three playing

705
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
cards.

706
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Forget, forget.

707
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Something's better than nothing at this stage.

708
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Okay, let's go next.

709
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Oh, a Joker slot.

710
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
I'm in.

711
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,560
I'm in.

712
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
When they do it like this, it gets so tricky.

713
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
And then hope for a king and a tent to come flying

714
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
back into my hands.

715
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Surely. Hydration check.

716
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,560
How do we call them?

717
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
Surprised you didn't go for the two, three, four and five.

718
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
I was feeling quirky. Okay.

719
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
It was, I was feeling quirky.

720
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
I got a fill house.

721
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Wait, what's the fill...

722
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Oh, you want me to go for fill house?

723
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,560
Fuck it.

724
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Okay, but we're not going to get a flush from doing this.

725
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,560
How much do we get?

726
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Sugar.

727
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
King, queen, jack.

728
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
So what, ten and nine?

729
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Or seven, six, five.

730
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Oh my gosh.

731
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Just completely re-roll.

732
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
I'm going to fail.

733
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
I've got three hands.

734
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Wait, I've only made a third.

735
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
No, we're going to have to start discarding

736
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,560
for a royal flush.

737
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
A royal straight.

738
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Oh, don't do this to me now, game.

739
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Unless I play a double here,

740
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
like double jack and double king.

741
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
The video lore girls get a little quirky at night.

742
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
More like being cheeky and nearly got clapped

743
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
for literally the first game in

744
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,560
and absolutely wrecking myself.

745
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Okay, that's exactly what I was hoping for.

746
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Let's go.

747
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,560
A straight. Let's go.

748
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
And it gets to play again on the big boys.

749
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Okay.

750
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Looks like I want everything to be royal.

751
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Cloud nine gave us a cheeky four bucks

752
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
on top as well, remaining discards.

753
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Yeah? Okay.

754
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Whoa, who are you?

755
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
At first hand, a round is a single six.

756
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
Destroy it to create a spectral card.

757
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
Sure, you're free.

758
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
I'll take you.

759
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Right.

760
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
We're investing in straights.

761
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Which is...

762
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
Ah, not here.

763
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
Lucky me. It's not here.

764
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Because why would it be here?

765
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
A straight flush?

766
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
That's so unlikely. Sorry.

767
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,560
I don't know who ever...

768
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
I don't know why you would play for that.

769
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Unless like you maybe got some spectral packs

770
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
that like completely...

771
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Uranis?

772
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Fine, I picked Uranis.

773
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
I'm not like the other cuttlefish.

774
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I get clapped.

775
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
I get clapped for my mistakes in Vulture.

776
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Choose one of up to three turrets.

777
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Hmm...

778
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
It's not looking good.

779
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I'm needing something a bit better.

780
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,560
I'm not like other steamers.

781
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
I get clapped at the convention

782
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
by the replays.

783
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
What the fuck? I need to stop.

784
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,560
I need to stop. That was terrible.

785
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Discard to re...

786
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Also me, I wonder why we got uninvited

787
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
from that one convention?

788
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Discard to random cards in the played hand.

789
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
That's fine.

790
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Oh no, it's not because I'm going for straights.

791
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
And a played hand

792
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,240
Queen yep, yep, okay straight show me how you work

793
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,480
Okay, okay, okay, let him get up let him get up

794
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,320
So we just need a ten which we have three remaining odds of ten or high

795
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,680
Which we have three remaining odds of ten or high

796
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Okay, there we go. That's all we needed

797
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I need the card that lets you jump yes

798
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,360
We found it the other day, but we we had already maxed out on pairs should have to all my pairs

799
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
um

800
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,280
Earned four bucks or an extra discard

801
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I mean

802
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Four bucks

803
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,960
We'll grab voucher first clearance sale not we uh, I have one space remaining

804
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Got a dip best of luck always risk the big play thank you

805
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,120
I'm wondering if we should get rid of eight ball for an extra discard because if we're going for straights

806
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
We need to be able to throw stuff away

807
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:50,160
I'm sorry if that's the wrong move, but it's my dumb move to make okay. Never gonna upgrade streets

808
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,200
Oh Saturn is a straight Saturn yes

809
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,720
And ring ring uh, you know what fuck it. Let's go for a turret. There's no such thing as interest so oh

810
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
We can do Saturn again

811
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,680
Absolutely, absolutely and you come right that worked out very well

812
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,680
Uh next base shop joker is

813
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:24,480
Polychrome and 1.5 multiplier. That's definitely worth it. I think I think let's find out

814
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,160
Discard is good for finding straights it is i'm

815
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
I

816
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,280
Know it's very painful doing it like this, but if we get a high flush this uh, whoever it is. Where are you?

817
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,000
If first hand of round is a single six

818
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Destroy it. No, I don't have a six

819
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,400
um

820
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:58,800
Yeah, this times three and we just levelled up straight. So we'll go for a royal. I know it looks crazy

821
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
I know it looks absolutely

822
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
Terrible thrown away, but are you joking me right now?

823
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Are you serious

824
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Are we hello

825
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
Hello

826
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:35,520
This game has nothing but the audacity

827
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,080
Are you kidding me right now?

828
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,600
I literally

829
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,760
Five discards and I couldn't get a high card and the queen still hasn't shown up. I think I might have just thrown that

830
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,520
Because all we needed was a high flush. I threw everything I had five discards for a high flush

831
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,640
Nine eight seven six five. Oh well. We need pray that this is going to do some work

832
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Are you kidding me?

833
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,000
Okay, thank goodness. Are you joking? You could have played the six

834
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,840
Eats. I need to jump. Whoa, who are you?

835
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,120
Okay, I will use you

836
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,880
Um, right. I'm going to keep the extra discard. Uh, I guess

837
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:27,120
You're in a dollar for each nine and no air and just straight up four bucks. Wait, who?

838
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,800
Oh, these are the exact same right get rid of you and you come. Yeah, you go to the right

839
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,520
You'll do your thing. All right, and then we're doing tariffs. Okay, tarot tarot card

840
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
little wild card

841
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
multipliers, I think we're gonna have to ask

842
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Let's do this

843
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,560
Here we go. Here we go and you come and you come

844
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,360
The hybrophant the planet

845
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,760
Left to right. Okay, we're gonna take a low and make it a queen now

846
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
The left card turns into the right card

847
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,760
We're gonna really try and max up on the high straights

848
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
create tarot card

849
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,800
If poker hand contains an ace and a straight

850
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,720
That is ridiculously difficult so

851
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,400
Um, no, I'm gonna keep my economy for now. I know there's no interest

852
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,480
Oh, maybe I shouldn't must play five cards. Don't have to tell me twice

853
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,600
10 9 8 7 6 5

854
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Mmm

855
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,400
It honestly looks like I have a better chance of doing low

856
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,080
Drop play the six

857
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,520
An ace two three four five equals a straight

858
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,040
Oh wait, hold on play the six play the six pause the dunes a first hand of round is a single six destroy it

859
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,200
Destroy it

860
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,560
Destroy it to create a spectral card. Does that mean discard?

861
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,960
If first hand of round is a single six destroy it

862
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Motherfucker

863
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,800
What did that mean destroy it are you from here?

864
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
I said destroy it

865
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,360
The first hand not the first discard a folk sick

866
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,240
It's too early in the morning for this. Hold on right king queen. Oh my god. Never get all the royals are coming out

867
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,880
Oh, we need a jack then

868
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,360
We would need a jack to go either way a jack or a ace

869
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,880
I said a jack

870
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Or an ace

871
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,520
Okay, ace king queen jack ten

872
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,640
I don't know why this game doesn't like me. I'm just trying my oh, I've got 14k for that. Okay that popped off

873
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,200
We're gonna be definitely investing in turrets. I'm gonna reroll. What are you rerolls cost two bucks less

874
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,840
You'll never guess what I want you

875
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,360
Iron five bucks for every four discards rank

876
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,280
changes

877
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
no

878
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,280
Game if you play astray. I mean that does compliment me

879
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,320
I'll destroy the six so there'll be new sixes. Oh, I get it now

880
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Right turret cartoon

881
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
The chariot

882
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,640
Enhances the steel

883
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,640
converts the diamond a wild cat

884
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,280
Uh destroy up to two selected cards. Did we destroy low?

885
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,080
No

886
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
maybe

887
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Three three four four four and four

888
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,640
I've got two. Oh, but that's a seven. It's like smack bang in the middle of the deck. It's not even lower numbers

889
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,040
Yeah, they're not they're not low enough spades steel. The best I got is a steel card steel card

890
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
How many who's who have I got the most of

891
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,720
A queen's the t-stat clea. I'm gonna oh wait both these queens are already special. Um, it's a wild card

892
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
Can't be used in any suit. No

893
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,400
You want the six to spectral you want the six?

894
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,160
It's turned into a steel. Are you on the ace to be a steel? I've got extra uses

895
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,840
I do

896
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,320
Didn't see this is why you guys are better playing this game than me because you guys spot stuff. I never look at

897
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm like, oh, oh, I can't see it. What are you talking about recently?

898
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,360
What are you talking about right glass? I don't like glass because I don't want it to break

899
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,960
It increases the rank of two selected cards. I absolutely believe that's probably the best

900
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
Thing to utilize so

901
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,400
Oh, let's make a few things higher nine

902
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Nine and eight let's bring it them up

903
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,760
I know I want things to be closer to a face card, but I don't want to completely negate the 10

904
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Maybe eight and seven

905
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Keep the nine

906
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,840
Eight and seven kind of push the deck higher

907
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,760
We've got two lore here and we want to push the deck upwards so we're more likely to roll higher

908
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:02,640
I don't know if that logic prevails though, but you know, you can push the four up what just four and

909
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I guess make a nine

910
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,480
You're right. You're right. Make it higher. Make it higher. Make it higher

911
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,400
Right. No, no make the lures higher that will make it prevail. Okay. I might have made a mistake

912
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,520
But you know what I tried we roll. Wow. What are you?

913
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,440
You're cool, but I don't need you

914
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:30,400
Uh, we're just gonna buy that to use it because we get multiplier up every time we use uh

915
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Thingy my barber discard

916
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
Gives a copy of the next like to tag

917
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,280
Lose the dollar pair around plate. Uh, I hope not

918
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,040
Rude I need an extra hand that would actually really come in clutch. I'm not gonna lie right everyone

919
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,120
Get used

920
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,840
Plot plop plop. Okay currently plus seven

921
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,880
Six solo six solo play

922
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,200
Race creates a random joker, but sets money to zero. Okay. We'll spend everything next round and use that

923
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Mm-hmm

924
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:13,760
Wait, why did I get an oh got an any any from that? Okay, so what nine eight seven six five? We need a seven

925
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
I really don't want to start

926
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Oh my gosh

927
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Our dad just go for high

928
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,200
I'm just gonna go for high because we have a retrigger face

929
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:35,200
Play and just the six. Yes. Thank you. I'm I really do elevate everyone part

930
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
This game loves trolling me

931
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,880
Surely I'll draw a ten surely

932
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,960
Okay, ace king queen jack ten go

933
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:58,000
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. That was 15. Let's right. How do I use rate?

934
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,760
Sets your money to zero right. We're gonna spend all on purpose

935
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Doubles money buy and use

936
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Up you go. Lovely. Lovely

937
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,760
Cheeky planets, please give me saturn

938
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Level up straight. Yes, please

939
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Okay, nice nice

940
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,400
Uh, and then three of a kind high card full house

941
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Um

942
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,000
I guess full house doesn't really do anything for me. Um, right. What are you?

943
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,080
Say it's your money to zero, but I can't utilize it. Hmm

944
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,520
I could probably use it now. Oh, I have made a grave error. I'm about to lose 37 dollars

945
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
oops

946
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,320
I'm using all my money then buys a car that doubles her money. Uh, I was gonna reroll

947
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,960
Ten wait, what am I doing? Add a negative joker, but take away your hand size. No, I'm already struggling with my hand size

948
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,200
For absolutely no reason your voice activated my phone and it was taken notice. Lovely. Lovely. Monka is

949
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,520
Monka is forget mind controlling you and mind controlling your technology add a gold seal to one slight card

950
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,280
That's probably

951
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,880
You don't have enough room for the joker. Anyway, you need to sell a joker to utilize that. Yeah

952
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,280
I'm not gonna lessen my hand size. I'm already struggling to get like a straight

953
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,560
Um

954
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
When plates so I guess you

955
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,600
Okay, and we're gonna reroll I've already had you guys and we're gonna reroll

956
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,560
And now reroll okay you buy and use

957
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
Did I just get rid of it?

958
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,560
Did I just sell this uh like I know it's race and like oh race big, but I'm just like oh should bet

959
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Creates a rear joker

960
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,120
One extra discard extra money

961
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,720
Just buy don't use

962
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,520
Either sell a joker or sell race make a choice

963
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,960
So this is complimentary to my high that

964
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,640
A

965
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,320
Spectral card and it's adding a slot. So really

966
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,040
The only guy I can get rid of ah fuck it. We're playing a gamba game. Let's go. Oh wait. No not yet

967
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,560
We need to buy and use. Okay, Uranus use

968
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,640
Okay, and then we'll use him reroll

969
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,520
Um, nope. You cannot tempt me fellow beast. Uh, don't be afraid to get I just got rid of you buddy

970
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay, please be rare and good a freaking a sake uncommon. I have one uncommon

971
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,720
Does he need to be at the back of him?

972
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,560
What's that so there's two uncommon in my deck

973
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,400
Times 4.5 is huge is it? Okay. Okay

974
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,400
It all works out in the end for moment

975
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,960
Right, hmm 7 5 4 2 I'm again. I just want to go for highs

976
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:23,120
I seem to be doing it in one as well for now ace king queen jack 10 if I'm still doing it in one

977
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,280
So you'll see what you do

978
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,120
Whoa

979
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,120
Okay

980
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
Okay

981
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,680
Okay, whoa

982
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,640
Wow

983
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:49,040
Who discard well, I don't need drunkard anymore because no need for drunkard is because I can't skip

984
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,520
No way. Oh come on streamer. Look you cannae tell me

985
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,920
Can skip okay. I need to remember I can skip now because it's gonna mess me up

986
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,760
Oh my god, what was it?

987
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,120
But what happens if you know like what if

988
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,080
What if riefling come on

989
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,600
What if what if

990
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,080
No, you're so stinky

991
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,520
Imagine if it like went the double way add a red seal

992
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,200
Converse all cards in hand to a random single suit

993
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,040
I mean sure add a red seal to one selected card in your hand

994
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,360
I

995
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,960
Red seal let's put it on a king then. I'll keep up

996
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,160
Uh, okay three times multi if a poker is already. Oh, wow. He's actually pretty good as well

997
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,840
But every I am quite happy with everything I've got right now

998
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,320
I mean, I guess the next weakest card we

999
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,520
Have is technically retriggers socks and buskin

1000
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,440
But we're not even we're getting 75 000 pair

1001
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,480
Red seal the king stick with what you have. Yeah, I shall not shall not be tempted

1002
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,400
right

1003
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,000
Let's do what we usually do wait. We can jump now

1004
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,680
But we can't do it with that

1005
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,640
You

1006
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:33,520
Ace king queen right no we can't right there's no point in having that then okay, so ace

1007
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,600
King queen jack nine eight. I guess oh, that's so weird

1008
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,520
I mean, oh that's mentally very um

1009
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,480
Like I can hardly oh, that's perfect

1010
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,880
I don't know if poker hand this joker gives a money when a booster pack is skipped. Nah, we're good. Um

1011
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
I'm gonna grab the voucher. I'm very happy with that

1012
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,560
Um, right and then a tarot card. Oh

1013
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
It's actually a toss up

1014
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:17,520
If I could get a straight upgrade then we can definitely keep up. Oh, that was the wrong choice. I guess

1015
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,520
I

1016
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,920
That was a wrong choice because we could have got a bit of a

1017
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,480
Thing going I'm gonna 25 dollars. Oh, I want to get that though

1018
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:39,360
We'll go for the next right so king jack 10 nine eight seven six five. Oh, that's

1019
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,280
That's bizarre

1020
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,720
That is bizarre

1021
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,600
Oh my gosh

1022
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
I can't he do that in my head

1023
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:01,840
Uh, right as a stone card. No enhances to the molly cards. Sure. Let's can I use using out? No, I can't well, of course

1024
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,840
That wouldn't be fair would it right for the kind to appear through the kind of course again not our freaking problem

1025
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Oh

1026
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,880
Again, please can we have what I request

1027
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
uh

1028
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,840
High card

1029
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,800
Lot are you kidding me? We are having just terrible luck

1030
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,720
To get what we want a flush is all the same color

1031
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,560
A full house is I mean sure and doesn't make a difference

1032
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,600
It doesn't make a difference right next round. Let's go

1033
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,160
We're gonna skip because we want the negative joker. What are you play only one hand? Thank goodness

1034
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,880
Thank goodness. Okay, so 10. No, right. Let's get rid of the lower

1035
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
be scaled

1036
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,400
Okay, so ace king jack 10 eight

1037
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,120
It's be them. It's oh wait. Sorry. Let's also shove you guys into a multi card

1038
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,080
So ace king jack 10 eight. Oh god that that's gonna mess it up

1039
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,240
Easy peasy lemon squeezy

1040
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,040
163

1041
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,920
She's too addicted to gamble. I'm not reading chat. Oh, no second joker from the left needs moving to the right

1042
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Second joker from the left

1043
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,600
It's moving to the right. Why yes, of course

1044
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,360
Um

1045
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Strony you should I

1046
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,520
Ganba time mommy's getting us out of the box. I think we're winning

1047
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,640
I don't want to say it, but

1048
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,880
three times motley's the poker

1049
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,440
So if we mess up one is straight and it doesn't give us enough we get times three that

1050
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,160
Holy moly

1051
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,160
Holy moly, that's insane

1052
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,440
Okay, please for the love of everything just give me

1053
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440

Oh wait, there is Saturn Saturn there is

1055

The second straight gets hella strong. You literally and unstoppable right. We'll do that. Why not card extra card in shop

1056
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,960
The obelisk. I don't like the obelisk any obelisk fans

1057
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,360
Hierophant bonus cards left to right

1058
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Okay five

1059
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
Can become a queen

1060
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,200
How many queens do I have? No, I have five queens. Okay

1061
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:43,840
I have five sevens. What the heck have I got seven in this deck? No, okay a five can become

1062
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,400
a

1063
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,920
Jack

1064
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:54,160
No, we can jump so ace jacks. We actually a ten would really be more beneficial

1065
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,920
Sealed king double the sealed king got it got it got it

1066
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,600
Let's go double the kings

1067
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,960
Right, and then we don't have enough through doing anything again. There's no

1068
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,800
Wow, okay ace king

1069
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,400
Oh, well wait, what why does my hand seem so small?

1070
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,440
So what I need a nine

1071
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,560
I don't want to throw away. I mean we only need to do it once so I guess we can throw it away

1072
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,000
It's not the nicest thing to throw away like all of this, but

1073
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,920
We could in theory

1074
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,120
Do that

1075
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,520
I just need a ten or a nine to be honest. Okay, there we go. Bing bing bing bing bing

1076
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,720
Even though I've got the jump

1077
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:00,400
Okay, how much are we getting pair of round played 187. Okay. I think this is a win and round. Sorry

1078
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,240
Well, I think this is a win and round. What's the deal here pair? No, no, no

1079
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,120
tarot card

1080
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,200
The world a gold card

1081
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,760
Sure, why not? Oh wait. No, let's make you a gold card

1082
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,120
uh and then

1083
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,760
I can just straight up skip this devil the three

1084
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,960
I can add a ten which will help me do my skip a bit more like

1085
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,840
Ace queen ten

1086
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,000
And then yeah, I kind of have the ten lets me access lower skips and then just skip all this

1087
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Maybe

1088
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,960
Well, this card stays in hand. I mean, no, it seems a shame

1089
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:01,040
I mean, I can do the skip I can do the the street skip thing. It's fine. It's fine

1090
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,840
Okay, can queen ten eight six

1091
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,560
It's so good though like it's so good hydration check

1092
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,960
Oh my god

1093
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,760
185

1094
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,400
Thousand

1095
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,880
Saw is but with one. Oh, we've sold one

1096
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,960
Uh, of course it's playing cards. It's not tarot cards because that would be too kind of the game

1097
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,120
The eight already popping off literally shows up instantly

1098
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,440
The three would have been better gotta hold the gold and steel can't play them for that thing

1099
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,040
Oh, I thought oh hold the gold. I thought it was to play the gold one

1100
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,040
She is playing the best base deck. Don't jinx the streamer man. No, no, no, we're doing fine

1101
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,000
We're doing fine with the I can roll a tarot. No

1102
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,960
One and four chance to upgrade poker hands. No

1103
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,720
There's nothing that we can really get tempted by

1104
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:10,640
Be at this stage unless it's a negative is the only thing I'm willing to skip for like we're doing good

1105
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,520
I want tarot cards. I don't want to be adding

1106
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:20,160
I mean, I guess maybe I can add more high stuff if it's got a high card in it. Okay. Yeah

1107
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,280
10 multiplier

1108
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,480
Is it high high give me a high number

1109
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,920
Nine is much better. Oh, there's an ace though

1110
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,880
Okay

1111
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:44,320
Okay, let's go next let's go nice all spade cards are debuffed. Yeah, that's not really a problem. My ace king queen jack ten night

Off done in one are you jokin?

1115
00:57:53,600 --> 00:58:00,720
Is it what is anyone even sweating the heck is a tablet of stone? Honestly? I've never used it yet. Okay. Let's use the wheel of fortune

1116
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
Oh

1117
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,080
Retriggers all face cards. Okay

1118
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,120
Re-rolls cost a little bit less. I'll take that

1119
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,160
I appreciate that kind gesture

1120
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:20,720

Whoa, that's great

We're getting pretty expensive out here. We are

Uh

1128
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,840
We could re-roll for cheap. Why you are different

1129
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,400
Nope re-roll for cheap. Well, it was a high card

1130
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,960
Now watch us for it re-roll for tires. Yeah

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,160
Well, I might need that hold on

Okay, yeah, so what do you do creates a planet card if it's still held in my hand

00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,360

00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,960

1148
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,840
It's fine. It's not a big deal. What?

1149
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,680

Uh, all right, come on Saturn

1152
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,080
Close enough. I'll take it

1153
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
It's not close enough for whatever

1154
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,120
Still gets you another Saturn another turret card

1155
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,240
So what do you do multi card bonus cards?

1156
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,920
Oh

1157
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,560
Oh my god, wait shortcut now it gives us 1.5. Holy moly

1158
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:59,040
Short cut gives us 1.5. This is getting outrageous. Sorry. This is getting outrageous this run

1159
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,160
Oh my god

1160
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,360
Right, we'll buy these both and use them against my greater judgment

1161
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:13,120
Save our money in case there's something good streamer luck is giving that dope mean literally I feel so much better

1162
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,760
After yesterday's stream

1163
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,480
Right, let's turn some stuff into space. Why not? Let's turn a spade into a spade. You know what I'm saying?

1164
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,040
And then a glass card of

1165
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:29,760
I don't like the idea of breaking anything. So I'm putting on a low. I know streamer bad, but I know

1166
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,320
Okay, so

1167
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,320
Kind of want to leave you in

1168
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,720
10 9 8 7

1169
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
Yeah, we do not have much going for us

1170
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,600
Okay, so get rid of you

1171
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,200
We want to keep oh my god, this isn't easy

1172
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,160
I don't I know that silly ace king queen jack 10

1173
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,040
I know that'll create a pot a planet, but

1174
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,960
I mean we can kind of waste a little bit

1175
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,360
Okay, hold on right ace king queens get

1176
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,680
To 10 to 8

1177
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,560
And we get a planet. Okay. That actually worked in our favor somehow streamer luck. Well, I know

1178
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,000
I just got here and this stuff is always create literally absolutely crazy right now

1179
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,200
So for those of you who are kindly joining us

1180
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,920
Um, we have retrigger all

1181
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,360
Face cards, which means the higher cards and our deck has got like 5 5 6 5 and for the face cards

1182
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
We have a negative

1183
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,000
Which is a cheeky spectral if I destroy the six which I've not been using at all. Um

1184
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,320
Got the fortune teller so every time I use a turret, but then we have the shortcut on streets

1185
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,640
We have the baseball for on commons, which we have two on common

1186
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,960
a third on common

1187
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:06,160
Then a multiplier if we do a straight and then a multiplier if the hand's already been done before so it's getting out of hand

1188
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,240
But in a good way

1189
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,360
You could just skip the jack and done ace queen 10 8 so

1190
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:23,280
Again, we got Saturn. So we're gonna just straight up level up. I have absolutely no problems. Uh, maybe Saturn again

1191
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,480
It was close

1192
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:33,120
It was between one or the other but it's fine. It's fine. And then again, we're gonna add a high card in

1193
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,360
Um

1194
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,920
I think 10 is just an assured way to win at this point

1195
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,640
reroll

1196
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,640
devil, yep

1197
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,960
Come the Joker gains a mall. I mean, I'm not gonna buy it pair

1198
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,440
Conceived hand played without scoring the high cards interesting

1199
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So you want to oh absolutely

1200
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,080
Absolutely

1201
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,600
Played face cards have a chance to give mere money right what way up against hold on blind

1202
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,280
Nope

1203
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,280
and nope

1204
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,480
The fish cards drawn face down

1205
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,400
Something tells me we're gonna be okay against the fish. Okay. I don't know. I just have

1206
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,400
Uh, three bucks of the heart the card is held. Okay. So what jack 10 98 7

1207
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,240
Okay, so we'll just shove the five devil

1208
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,200
one two

1209
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,960
three four and five

1210
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,920
Yeah, something tells me we're not going to be struggling through this gameplay

1211
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,800
2.5 is still your highest combo though

1212
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,440
Yeah, I was a little lipped with it

1213
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,120
We get so much money as well

1214
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:58,720
Two bucks for four hands remaining two bucks for four discards at four bucks. Sorry money and stuff one consumable slot and you come

1215
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,920
and you come

1216
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,920
um

1217
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,480
Sure

1218
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,560
Free money. Thank you and we get a little level up on that

1219
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:16,000
Again with the playing cards. It really does not want to give me tarot cards. Does it?

1220
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,560
Give me the king give me has

1221
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,520
We'll just pick the

1222
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,680
That's fine. We're just literally we're gonna max out on high

1223
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,120
What do you do earn four dollars if the poker hand has a straight?

1224
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:38,800
Yeah, you can you get negative poker cards in the shop or is the rarity of it insane because I don't think I've ever

1225
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,960
done it

1226
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,440
Rerolls the blind forces one card to always be selected

1227
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,960
I mean

1228
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,760
With our skip is that really that bad?

1229
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,120
All right, I'll buy you so we can use you four of the canes

1230
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,400
Free money

1231
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,400
It won't always be a straight

1232
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:11,440
Chances non zero. There's a voucher. You can get random negatives, but it's so rare

1233
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,920
I'd be oh wait, I can't okay use please. Thank you

1234
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,920
Yeah

1235
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,560
Uh sure by that and we'll use that

1236
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:28,320
Uh the point in rerolling at the moment because our hand is full and we need access to our deck

1237
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Oh, yes

1238
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,560
Okay, so strength maker to

1239
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,840
Uh 10 I guess

1240
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,640
We've got seven coins

1241
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,960
An ace. Oh, you know what make it an ace. Why not boom boom boom boom

1242
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,880
What

1243
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,200
Wait

1244
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,520
What did I

1245
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,520
Huh, what did I just do?

1246
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,520
That was oh

1247
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:08,720
Okay, it's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's not a big deal. It's fine seven six five three two

1248
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,960
brav

1249
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:16,800
Brav I wasn't reading strength. We'll just lost an ace. I'm sorry

1250
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,760
I got confuzzled. Okay. I thought it was the thing

1251
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,200
Like the oh

1252
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:31,680
Yes for how many steel interesting. I don't have I don't have it, but it's fine

1253
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,040
Oh, we just need a few more saturns to make up for that. That was my bad. That was my it's fine. She's winning too hard

1254
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,560
I don't need to think exactly. I don't need to think we're just

1255
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,240
Steam rolling up. I guess I mean, I guess

1256
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,680
Though I really want a six. Oh, there's only two

1257
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,640
Do I really want

1258
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,040
No, I don't I'm oh wait. I could have used that gray card. Oh

1259
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:08,400
Well, I did it now. All right, let's see if we can get a cheeky negative because why not

1260
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:17,360
One discard each round. Come on. Give us a negative. You know, you want to re-rolls boss blind and initial card

1261
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,600
Nah, give us a

1262
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,680
Yeah thingy or give us a tarot

1263
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,080
Jeez

1264
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,080
Are you serious?

1265
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:29,360
Got the shop hates me

1266
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,120
Oh, okay, there we go

1267
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,200
One more

1268
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,400
Increases rank of the two so like oh for goodness sake. Yes, and you come

1269
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,080
Silly, okay increases rank

1270

Repeat after me increases

1271
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,360
rank

1272
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:57,760
So what the five and the three to push them up the board

1273
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,040
Increases rank you

1274
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,360
Silly sausage you

01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,240

Nine eight seven six four. Yeah easy piece of lemon squeezes

1278
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:24,080
We can't stop you can't you can't do it. I'm on fire

1279
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,280
Sixteen dollar reduced don't mind if I'd urinous

Then sure let's call upon okay, there's not any other variation that we really want so fine

1283
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,240
It's fine and then two tarot cards, which will absolutely take um

1284
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,880
I know I shouldn't but I can't help it. I love the gambas. No

1285
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,960
Okay, and then no glass card multi-card

1286
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,720
Bonus cards increase the rank maybe

1287
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,920
Uh

1288
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:20,000
We'll do molly cards. Why not? Let's make that jack and ace worth some

1289
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,120
worth simsing

1290
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,040
The true halo. Oh my god. Is that halo? Is that master chief from the hit game?

1291
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
A fortnight. I'm sorry

1292
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,400
That why you're so cool looking. Oh, that's messing up my eyes

1293
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,480
Thank you very much for coming to member. I appreciate the

1294
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
direct support

1295
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
Retriggers all cards. No

1296
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
Yeah, let's go

1297
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:52,240
Right, why are you forcing me to play a king a queen a jack a ten?

1298
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,440
No, that's up here. Shout out to all my players right so

1299
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,880
Back and still throw away for

1300
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,680
I know it. I know it seems crazy

1301
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,800
Wait

1302
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,240
That changes every hand

1303
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,440
That's so dangerous

1304
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,320
Oh because it's selected it would get thrown away dafty

1305
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:30,640
Oh, we won on the deck. We did it first freaking try good thing. I didn't bet against you damn straight

1306
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,680
Little thing you

1307
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,800
I am so dumb. Of course. It would throw away the selected card. I was like, I'm going to play around this

1308
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,280
We are very lucky. We actually

1309
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,360
Did that whole ole money. All right. I'm not going to do endless modes

1310
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,480
Have at least two polychrome jokers

1311
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,040
Two plus multi for every five dollars you have

1312
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:00,000
Okay, curious little hydration check start run with no face cards and you're

1313
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,880
No face cards

1314
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,880
Right, we've got a seal for red blue yellow green. We don't

1315
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,960
One plus joker slot, but one less hand

1316
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,600
Hmm one less hand so three hands total

1317
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,640
Hmm curious

1318
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:35,600
I've already forgotten what one less hand but one more joker slot. Okay. Well, we've got six five

1319
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,400
We've got dupla vase

1320
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:48,880
I mean we'll play the doubles two pair. Why not? Well, that really wasn't that much points if I'm going to be honest

1321
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,280
Uh, I thought that was going to be a little bit more

1322
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,800
Uh, we do have a suit in the distance

1323
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,160
I might regret this but

1324
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,320
Okay, we got the suit

1325
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,400
We got the flush. Yeah

1326
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,920
Okay, there we go. We made it. We made it. It's fine. It's fine. Right. We're back to normal economy. So

1327
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,800
Not the game already pushing us to try and

1328
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,000
Um do two pairs. No, we don't have anything that shapes the deck. Yeah

1329
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,360
Our economy's rubbish, are we gonna win the

1330
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,000
If I fail the hook discard two random cards each time please

1331
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,600
I actually think we need to invest, you know that

1332
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,280
Wait the hiker. Yeah, okay, okay

1333
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,760
Uh, sure and we'll level up two pair because I'm a little bit nervous about this last one

1334
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,560
Oh wait

1335
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,560
I didn't realize we were or we weren't at the boss fight yet. Hold on. I shouldn't have done that but we did it anyway, so

1336
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:03,600
Let's do ranks. We already have two doubles and we did just level up pairs. So shout out to all my pairs

1337
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,880
We're gonna throw away that five so it's no longer in our inventory

1338
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,320
Um, and then we are going to repeat and do the exact same thing

1339
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,760
Two doubles throw away the five and there

1340
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,280
We almost had it. Sorry my impression was again two doubles

1341
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,840
And so just throw away one

1342
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,800
Uh

1343
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,800
There we go

1344
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,160
I wouldn't say easy that was our last hand

1345
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,800
A bit of a rough start I have to admit

1346
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,720
I mean we can use a tarot

1347
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,200
Or we could do three of a kind. Um

1348
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,640
Early hiker is pretty good

1349
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,760
We don't have anything that shapes us

1350
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,560
I kind of want to get economy going. Fuck it. We need we need a gamble. We need gamble. I need economy

1351
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,280
discard two random cards pair hand played well

1352
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:14,480
Well, let's do that and see oh, of course the ace goes flying into space. Um

1353
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,280
We're getting incredibly lucky with the

1354
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:28,640
The cards though. I think if you go for flushes straight house, you'll win this boss fight. Hmm. Okay. We'll one it thankfully but

1355
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:34,960
I need to retrain my brain because it wants to oh my god

1356
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,760
Did you hear my stomach?

1357
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,120
That's not gonna be enough is it no it doesn't look like that

1358
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:49,840
I mean it would be kind of oh no, we only have one hand left whole holy moley. I was about to throw there

1359
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,560
Um

1360
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,120
Okay, get rid of these

1361
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,160
Okay, that's fine. That's fine. We're safe. We're safe. Relax

1362
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,920
No flake. It's called being bad at about true

1363
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,880
Okay, that's fine. We didn't get any interest but we will next round

1364
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,920
so

1365
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,720
That's just awful by all the kids. Oh, did we do it?

1366
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:30,560
We could shape our deck right now. What's the what the beans can I get a base?

1367
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,800
Next base addition Joker is free and a foil

1368
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,520
Hmm

1369
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,960
Minus one hand size. Hmm. I do not have much faith for this

1370
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,920
I think we're gonna have to shape the deck right now

1371
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,480
Earn five bucks for each discarded ace

1372
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,520
A first discard of round has only one card

1373
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,240
Oh for goodness sake

1374
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,600
That's not shaping the deck at all

1375
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,320
for you

1376
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,320
First played face cards give times to it

1377
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,320
Please don't help me

1378
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:20,720
Earn an extra dollar of interest for every five bucks you have at the end of the round

1379
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:28,480
Right, I don't think we're gonna win and for that reason alone. I'm going to discover that card

1380
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,320
I know it's going to be frustrating being like you're literally thrown because you're not

1381
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,320
I think we're already to pass the point of winning

1382
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,920
We'll do a free Joker in the next shop, but

1383
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,240
I for each earned five bucks for discarding an ace

1384
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,920
Five four three two nothing

1385
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,000
The black deck is the hardest to play. Yeah, and I'm needing something to

1386
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,680
Yeah

1387
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,400
I

1388
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,240
Right what I need a 10 under queen

1389
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,760
Close but no cigar a 10

1390
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,160
Okay

1391
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,640
10

1392
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:35,600
Okay, well

1393
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,200
Well

1394
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,440
That's why I bought that because I didn't think we'd be lucky and yeah, no no got it

1395
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,800
Literally what can I do a true purple that's a three of a kind

1396
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:59,280
Can't do nothing else, right? Okay. Let's try that again. Let's try that again. We unfortunately didn't get anything that was kind of complimentary

1397
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,000
So again one post joker slot, but minus a tiki hand

1398
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,840
That was rough right. What are you uncommon Joker?

1399
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,080
I

1400
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:16,400
Skip that for the rare because you can't do two in a row for some reason

1401
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,240
Let's go for double vase

1402
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Shoot easy easy to win off the bat for these ones. Um

1403
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
10 98

1404
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Gonna work um

1405
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,040
Gee imagine if you gave me

1406
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:38,960
Oh, wait, you know what? Let's just play the doubles and get rid of that

1407
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,400
God this this game does not like me

1408
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:54,880
Wait, okay, we'll just do a full house. That's fine. That's fine. It's fine. We can do a full house. See it's fine relax

1409
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:00,000
Okay, what are we looking at? What are we looking at?

1410
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And

1411
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,520
Well, we can't buy anything

1412
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,720
I think we're gonna have to just go in

1413
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:17,200
And try and do something like that could be better. I'm gonna be honest that could be better

1414
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
I think we'll invest in

1415
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,800
Oh

1416
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,160
Why are these so sucky and not the good kind?

1417
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,120
Okay, we're gonna skip the rare

1418
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:40,240
Sorry, we're gonna skip the blind in order to do get a free Joker because we need jokers to instantly

1419
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,240
Shoot maybe

1420
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:53,200
We need jokers to help us out played cards with spades to give plus three wins scored spade

1421
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,600
I don't even have one spade on hand. So that's not happening

1422
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,880
Unless I'm just throwing everything in the bin

1423
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:14,240
I mean, I could sorry the smart stomach internally farting if I came up in my um, I could go for a flush on

1424
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,440
heart

1425
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:22,320
This is my first stream. Wow. Hello. Thank you for the tip. I appreciate it

1426
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:29,200
Your first stream and it's me being rubbish on freaking Baltral shaking my head my head

1427
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,440
Or did you come in right at the start where I showed the pregnancy artwork? Hmm. Hmm

1428
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:38,160
Be honest. So when was it?

1429
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,040
I don't know what to do

1430
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,240
I could go for a flush with hearts

1431
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,800
Okay, that actually kind of worked out somehow

1432
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,880
And that got me 200 for that play which is all I need

1433
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,320
This is

1434
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:12,820
Not good not not good at all. I think I might have to discard for a flush of spades

1435
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,280
Oh

1436
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,680
My god

1437
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,000
I think we're better going for diamonds. Oh, no, they've only got six diamonds

1438
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:43,120
So the odds of pulling us. Okay. Sorry. I'm so sorry. This is gonna look painful, but

1439
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,720
Yeah, okay, that's what I wanted

1440
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,280
Okay

1441
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:04,560
That paid off somehow that paid off and we get a free joker out of the shop. What is it?

1442
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:07,680
I'm

1443
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,320
I don't have anything

1444
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,960
Oh, this is cursed

1445
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,800
This is cursed so much

1446
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,880
I

1447
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,880
Have nothing shaping this again

1448
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,800
Add one voucher three hand size base chips and mullies or have

1449
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
Brothers is too hard

1450
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,920
And not the good game

1451
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,360
I have nothing

1452
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,600
Oh

1453
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,280
There's no point in spending any money I have no direction

1454
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,200
I have no direction in my game

1455
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:54,480
There's

1456
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:58,400
Oh, I don't I don't believe maybe we'll try a different pack next round

1457
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,640
Because uh, I do not think we've got this

1458
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,520
What's this ace ken queen jack right so give me a ten

1459
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,480
So go

1460
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,960
Give me a ten

1461
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,760
You know your funny game, I don't like you

1462
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:30,400
I don't think we've won this I think we'll try a different deck because holy moly is this deck freaking hard like not the good kind

1463
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:38,640
Why we we might just have to fucking put everything into space honestly

1464
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,600
Doubles I mean

1465
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,280
Should we just

1466
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,400
Right I've never used this before the credit card, but

1467
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,880
I think we're just gonna have to go all in or else like we just straight up can't win

1468
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:14,960
To convert the left death select two cards converts the left into the right. So this is the one we do want

1469
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,160
So take the two make it a queen

1470
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:24,640
Oh, but then there's what I don't even want to use the wheel of fortune ain't gonna get scone for me

1471
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:28,160
We're just gonna go in today. I'm sorry

1472
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,120
Hi, thank you for joining

1473
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,680
um

1474
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,680
Hearts not

1475
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:44,000
The only thing is spades. We're even interested in multi cards. Yeah, we're just use mullies on the highs

1476
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,040
This is rough

1477
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,680
We can go into debt but over a card slot. I don't think so

1478
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,160
I don't think so base chips

1479
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:06,640
I don't know if I'm making any of the right decisions, but this is like this is terrible

1480
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,960
Oh

1481
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,080
Absolutely terrible. No, what are you uncommon? Okay, so that's good

1482
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,480
98

1483
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,960
987 no, we can't do nothing there. All right, let's get rid of the wee ones

1484
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,480
I know we need a 10 and and obviously it's not gonna give me one

1485
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:40,720
We got a McMansion only to lose it in the next round literally that game was so good clubs flush. Oh

1486
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:47,200
Okay, you are absolutely correct. How did you even see that?

1487
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:50,400
Play

1488
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:54,480
Oh wait, is this spades? Oh, it's spades. Oops. It's the other one I need

1489
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,120
Are you kidding me

1490
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,560
This

1491
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:11,680
Game is such a troll one minute. It's like, yeah, don't worry. I got you

1492
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,680
I'll get you addicted real quick baby cakes and then the next minute. It's like now you're on your own

1493
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,120
The whip flash I get from playing this game

1494
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,960
Okay, that this guy is saving us right now

1495
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,360
I

1496
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,040
Would absolutely adore an extra hand size. Thank you

1497
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,160
Okay, a minus four. That's fine

1498
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,160
One discard each round two plus hand size

1499
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,160
But an uh hand size down

1500
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,720
I need something anything to shape this run

1501
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,280
No

1502
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,760
Spades and clubs are confusing. I'm too small brain honestly get the plus two joker

1503
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,240
Like

1504
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,040
Like I might as well just go all out

1505
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:13,920
I'm gonna pop. Why is this game so hard this game would I'm just I'm going full debt

1506
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:21,840
Mummies losing the house mum mummies failing her mortgage payments. That's it. I owe so much ASMR right now

1507
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:33,360
Wa wa wa diamonds hearts clubs spades wait, what what we're picking

1508
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,200
Two times multi two and four chance to get destroyed though

1509
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:43,760
I feel like you're just gonna get destroyed instantly 50 chance of it popping away

1510
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:52,320
Card can be used in any suit. I feel like maybe just I feel like we have to go spades. I know it sounds silly, but

1511
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,120
I don't want to be homeless. I mean, are you technically homeless if you can

1512
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,680
That's it. Are you technically

1513
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,240
Oh

1514
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:12,400
Next base edition shop joker is a free and holographic. Well, we're gonna have to go for it

1515
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,160
Not that one though

1516
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,200
Um

1517
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,160
You can't be homeless if you can technically

1518
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:32,560
Get inside somewhere and have a home there wink wink right discard all that

1519
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,080
Okay, I gave me a space

1520
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,640
This is the this I think we're gonna have to go suits

1521
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,920
A flush sorry my pardon me. I think we're gonna have to go with flush

1522
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:55,120
What are you you're free for each joker card? Absolutely. What take out take away a discard I guess

1523
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
Yeah, and then in you come

1524
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,400
And then

1525
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:07,840
Yep, I will go into debt for spades because we want all the spades

1526
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:12,080
And then I can't go into any further debt. That's fine

1527
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,520
Okay

1528
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,840
Spades or play only

1529
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:22,640
Oh, well, it's over now in that suits spades and then

1530
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,400
Do the rank and then turn all you guys into spades

1531
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:35,440
Okay, and then do a suit again and then ace did it since we can only play one round. Good luck

1532
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:46,640
Okay, well we have her we have our bearings

1533
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,560
Which is we want things to be a

1534
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,640
Flush

1535
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:04,400
And do we upgrade flush via celestial hat flush flush flush flush flush dripper

1536
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,800
We are in so much debt

1537
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,080
Choose two four jokers

1538
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,640
Would it all spade cut?

1539
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:21,360
Yeah

1540
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,320
Are you serious?

1541
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,640
Are you serious?

1542
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:32,080
All spade cards are debuff. Meanwhile, this is the only thing keeping us alive right now

1543
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,960
The curse of the credit card

1544
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,440
Shawnee owns the debt collectors. Oh gee. Honestly

1545
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,440
Now sell the credit card I lose the game if I sell it

1546
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,960
Because I'm like in so much debt

1547
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:54,880
That's how they get you this we are literally learning an economy 101 right now

1548
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,680
This is how they get you

1549
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,440
Should I do the buffoon

1550
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,720
You know what wait? No, you're on common, but you're common

1551
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,240
So maybe I can pick up an uncommon and then he can come in to play

1552
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,240
I'll put you to the end

1553
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:17,440
You know what let's let's get silly with it

1554
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,880
Let's get silly with uh, there's only one uncommon

1555
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,800
Uh, well this was

1556
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,520
Absolutely useless right if I sell you

1557
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,240
Then add you

1558
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:32,560
Because you're on common so you're gonna compliment him

1559
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:37,920
Gain chips if the hand contains a straight right. We need a bigger hand size

1560
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,000
Oops all sixes doubles all listed probabilities. I don't

1561
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,840
Know

1562
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,720
We what

1563
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,280
Wait, did I kill us with debt?

1564
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:10,240
Oh my god, wait, I don't have my glasses on that that's definitely a minus sign

1565
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,160
Uh, my bad. I'm a I'm gonna just sell that

1566
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,720
Uh

1567
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:24,960
Yeah, let me let me just sell that my bad. Uh, wasn't who wasn't my intended purpose

1568
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,720
Uh, we'll just do the straight then eat

1569
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,080
I didn't even know the game worked like that

1570
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:39,440
Well, I think we're gonna have to skip as well because our freaking only card is deep off

1571
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:46,960
How much does one regular flush get us

1572
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
Wow

1573
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,400
We may make it

1574
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:02,960
We may make it in in the end

1575
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:08,960
I

1576
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,960
So what happens now?

1577
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:15,920
Okay

1578
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:25,360
The one thing we put right new run we need a different card. That's so hard

1579
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,400
That's so hard

1580
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:35,680
Mommy, there's only so much debt a reef Lincoln handle. Literally. Sorry. I completely screwed that run over

1581
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:41,280
Uh, I was getting a bit confused. Okay. I was getting confuzzled. Am I not allowed to be confuzzled?

1582
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,680
Rude honestly

1583
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:44,880
Right

1584
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,800
Spatial cards may appear in the shop start with a hex

1585
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:59,360
Is that even bad

1586
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,320
Destroy all their jokers

1587
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,640
Okay

1588
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,880
But we don't even

1589
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,360
Wait, so if we have two jokers, I'd pull

1590
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:20,720
If we have two jokers 50% one is destroyed 50% the other is

1591
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,160
Receives a buff, okay

1592
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:34,160
The run went from mummy please to mother the debt literally absolutely twat that

1593
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:39,360
Uh, just go for double base and we're there

1594
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,800
Okay

1595
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,000
Can't believe it. I'm actually gonna have to play the economy in this game. Uh

1596
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:55,040
You need but really they go for a bit fun pack and try and shape it off the bat

1597
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,640
Against my better judgment adds the number of poker

1598
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,560
Times the poker hand has been played this run to the molly

1599
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,960
This joker gains

1600
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,440
multiplier for each card sold

1601
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:16,640
Resets when the boss is no that's rubbish

1602
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,520
Sure come aboard you

1603
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:27,360
And then do that and then it's a 50 50 right, okay, we now have a 1.5

1604
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:36,560
As the number of times the poker hand has been played this run to the multiplier, okay, so we just keep going

1605
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,680
I don't think I'm understanding this properly um

1606
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,960
We do have a duple of aim

1607
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,600
I do we just get rid of all the low

1608
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,320
Now the more you play the same hand the stronger it gets

1609
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,360
Oh, no

1610
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,080
Well, there's another full house. Why not?

1611
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,760
So I want to do full house now

1612
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,720
Uh tarot another joker

1613
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,600
Hopefully we can get a negative joker the next all spade cards are debuff. That's fine. Um

1614
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:30,240
Mummy disassociating in the club playing purely off of vibes. Honestly. I'm getting lost in this loss

1615
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,240
Right, that's fine. Clubs are debuffed. That's fine

1616
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:42,960
Right if they're debuffed, I don't even want them in my hand to be honest

1617
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:48,240
I'm sure I'm probably making like some should I just go for a flush

1618
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,800
Clearly not

1619
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,080
What's this then? I have a duple of e

1620
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,160
To appears how much is that gonna get me

1621
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:07,840
No, oh, yeah, that's not even that bad. I don't know how you work, but you're honestly helping. Um

1622
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,680
Ten nine eight seven six. I got rid of roots of sixes

1623
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,920
Oh wait idiot jack ten nine eight seven

1624
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:28,720
He he he sorry. Sorry. I raised your blood pressure. They're almost hitting send. I'm sorry. I know what did

1625
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,280
I almost did it. Okay. We've got one dollar interest. That's what I like to see

1626
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,400
Raises the cap on interest

1627
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,200
I wouldn't mind that

1628
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:46,800
Initial booster packs are free and I can pick two joe. I might do double skip. You know that

1629
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,760
No, I can't

1630
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,720
Hmm

1631
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:59,280
What is it booster packs are free initial cards and booster packs? Okay, that might be worth it

1632
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:02,960
Oh, my mouse is uh, please don't die mid game. That would be great. Mr. Mouse

1633
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,600
I think we're gonna go and get more money

1634
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Uh, we'll do that

1635
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,840
I know I should probably invest in two pairs something but

1636
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:24,080
I didn't trust it right. We're gonna get free stuff from the shop and then we're gonna play

1637
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:28,240
Oh

1638
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,240
A cheeky double. Is that the best I got?

1639
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,520
What does one hand do?

1640
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,840
A full house, please work

1641
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:45,360
Okay, that was lucky right what is free in the shop, please help us

1642
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,240
Please I beg

1643
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:53,760
Well, it's free. So go for it. Wait bye. Oh, I mean, I guess bye

1644
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:00,000
We does the card or a planet card

1645
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,480
So

1646
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,600
I don't even oh this run isn't

1647
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,720
See when you cannae

1648
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,440
When you cannae shape the run right at the start

1649
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,240
It becomes like a shot in the dark it really does

1650
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:29,840
I think maybe three of a kind I seem to be or maybe two pairs. They see the most common

1651
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:36,720
Well, you can just you just gotta start picking but that's pressure and stuff

1652
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,600
Right must play five cards. That's fine

1653
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,840
Uh, right, we just did get doubles. So let's do that play hand

1654
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:48,960
Is that yet? No

1655
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:54,640
Okay, that's not that bad. That's not that bad really. It's we're doing fine for now. We're doing fine

1656
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:59,920
I need to well destroy lower number cards. Yeah

1657
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,840
We got nine our economy's getting there

1658
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,960
That's pretty good have to admit

1659
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:15,920
These however are the worst why can't I use it?

1660
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:21,200
Do you need to have a second joker to use it the egg

1661
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:24,720
Gains three bucks of sell value at end of round

1662
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:33,200
What it just keeps going up and up and up or is there like a ceiling

1663
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:41,440
Is this like playing the stonks market invest in stonks now and then later it's better

1664
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:46,880
It goes up. Okay. I'll get I've never I've not grabbed it before so I'm glad I can unlock it

1665
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,240
It right

1666
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:57,040
Fuck it. No, wait. No, no, wait. No, I should hold on to it

1667
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:04,640
Oh, no, wait, never I should hold on to it because it's a plus 10

1668
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:16,320
Only I would manage that. What do you do spectrum? No, keep your eyes from both of them

1669
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,560
But now it does something till you need to sell it

1670
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:27,040
We can get better with the cash later. Honestly, how can I be messing this up so much, right?

1671
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:31,200
Would it create the planet if there if it's held in the hand? That's fine

1672
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:35,600
Oh, wait, I need to delete the smaller cards

1673
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,720
I don't know

1674
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:47,200
I just destroy the two

1675
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,800
Which wasn't very nice, but I did what I had to do

1676
01:42:53,520 --> 01:43:01,200
You discard those okay, we can do a flush again a full house my apologies a full push

1677
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,240
Well, there it is

1678
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,200
I guess we're going for it with him

1679
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,040
With a full house, which I don't normally go for but he will

1680
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:15,760
Uh diamond cards

1681
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:19,600
We might be doing it as if I can even get

1682
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:24,720
Three three times multiplier if you have 16 enhanced card currently nothing

1683
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,520
Yeah, no, uh, I'm not gonna be shocked that I I'm not going for that because jase

1684
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:40,320
Plus three multiplier on a diamond how much do you sell for a whole six dollar beautiful stuff, right?

1685
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,320
What are we looking at?

1686
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:45,040
Rubbage, right just keep sending it

1687
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,920
I think we're gonna have to go full house

1688
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:52,080
Runs if we can even do it because we can't on the first one

1689
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,440
And get rid of that play hand

1690
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,080
How much?

1691
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,440
We're making it by the skin of our teeth for now

1692
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,880
For now we can do it

1693
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:14,160
You leveled up again. Oh, he's nine dollars

1694
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:27,920
Ah this nothing is being shaped right now nothing at all

1695
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:35,680
I'm just going for it and our freaking egg is mocking us saying. Oh you want to sell me don't you?

1696
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,640
Multi needs to be before

1697
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,960
You go here

1698
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,240
The daily card get me 2.5 million feels good man

1699
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:02,160
Okay, supernova's at the end. Thank you one day. I'll remember fancy-looking cards to the right

1700
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,120
Is to do that day? No, no it is not

1701
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,840
um

1702
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,200
And then is this the boss by one minus hand size

1703
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,160
We're actually doing

1704
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:19,440
Okay in quotation marks. So I I'm confident we at least have this round

1705
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:28,560
Oh, it meant handers and cards in my deck. Uh, we might have to go for a suit

1706
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:40,640
Oh

1707
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,680
Thank goodness, thank goodness

1708
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Okay

1709
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:03,520
I'd really rather like to keep that to have a hidden upgrade

1710
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,760
Uh

1711
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,280
But playing this is gonna do like next to nothing

1712
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,680
If you draw 10 it's a straight flush

1713
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:29,200
Wait, I have three hands. Hold on. I have two more. Sorry. That's for something again. Right. That's fine

1714
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,520
I

1715
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,400
Need a 10

1716
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:52,240
I needed a 10 either way right what do two kings do I really want to keep this

1717
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:57,360
Okay, okay

1718
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:04,320
I literally I just I want to level up anything because I'm I'm scrambling right now trying to save this run

1719
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:10,480
Ouija minus hand size. Absolutely not. I'm have I'm perishing

1720
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,400
Converts all cards into a straight wait. I'm not doing

1721
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
No, I need diamonds apparently

1722
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,280
Bruh, this this is the worst run. I think we've ever had there's like no point in spending any money

1723
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Oh

1724
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,320
You believe

1725
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:37,440
I'm perishing

1726
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,320
I'm perishing I've got a rank possibly

1727
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,320
Okay

1728
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:56,160
Oh my god my stomach's making me feel crazy. Bruh

1729
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:02,320
Honestly, I did it. Streamer luck has to kick in at some point. I think I used it on the first run

1730
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,160
This is like awful

1731
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,960
Oh

1732
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:17,360
Literally the the egg that is taunting us is keeping us alive. Oh my god. It's ready to help as well

1733
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,800
Which I really don't want but hey, I mean we'll get a

1734
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,720
A thing so

1735
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:29,040
You know, I'll take you anything that levels up anything. I'll take it

1736
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,720
Yep

1737
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:34,720
I

1738
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:39,840
Literally level up anything I am scrambling I'm scrambling

1739
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,400
Sure, let's just keep leveling up to a pair

1740
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,440
Scramble any harder

1741
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,920
Call me eggs because I'm scrambling for anything, right?

1742
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:54,720
Sure, we've got room for another Joker. Let's see if we can shape with four

1743
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,280
awful

1744
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,280
awful

1745
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,720
Oh, I guess you

1746
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,480
The egg is keeping us alive. I can't even get rid of the purr guy

1747
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,200
Diamonds are helping loyalty card is helping

1748
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:27,200
Poker splash

1749
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:30,160
You had a straight but you tossed it

1750
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:37,440
I don't think I've had enough sleep. I slept all day after stream yesterday and I still don't think I had enough sleep

1751
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:45,920
Airing an extra dollar of interest I wish I could sell

1752
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:55,040
This is gonna come in clutch whenever we're absolutely panicking I don't think I'm gonna have to skip these are rubbish

1753
01:49:57,920 --> 01:49:59,920
I

1754
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,480
I'm not gonna make it not gonna make it

1755
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,120
I do not believe

1756
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,840
I do not believe I haven't slept a single segment straight into work after stream. I'll let you zombie

1757
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,280
I had enough sleep, but it wasn't enough. Are you me? I am

1758
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Um

1759
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,400
How do you guys see that so easily?

1760
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,200
I'm destroyed from all the crying. I am I'm actually distraught

1761
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,560
I

1762
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,000
For anyone who didn't see yesterday's stream

1763
01:50:40,240 --> 01:50:44,080
I've got John Wick spoilers if you don't want to listen for like the next three minutes

1764
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,440
If you just want to close your ear. Oh my god. I can't even open up my bottle of water

1765
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:54,320
Oh, oh, did you hear my wrist crack trying to open this bottle of water? Geez, what did they make the freaking cap out of titanium steel?

1766
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,920
Outrageous, um

1767
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,400
Did you hear it?

1768
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:08,480
Ew, that's so gross. My wrists are really I have it incredibly. I thought that was the bottle cap

1769
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:09,920
Fine

1770
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:16,320
Um, I have really weak wrists and hands for some reason like all my strength is in my thighs and my

1771
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:21,280
My gluteus maximus. That's where all the strength in my body lies. I have no other strength

1772
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:25,440
I have no strength in my back. I have no strength in my hands my arms my wrists anything like that

1773
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:33,360
Um, it's just all all even my even my toes are stronger because I can grip things with it

1774
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,800
Like I have absolutely nothing else going for me

1775
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,920
Um

1776
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,920
Right jack 10 987

1777
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:47,920
Wait, we only got 1.8. When do you pot? Oh, you don't pot

1778
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Oh no

1779
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:59,600
Oh no, right, we've got a full house which is leveled up

1780
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:06,640
We're gonna be okay. I think oh no, we did it. We did it

1781
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:14,320
How much are you $18 or beloved egg is $18 now three of a kind

1782
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:27,360
I don't have anything strong it opens jars with their thighs. Oh, no, you have to tap it on the bunker

1783
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,240
um, if you tap the jar lid on the bunker it like

1784
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,440
Weakens it and then you can open up

1785
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,840
um

1786
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:44,720
Crumbling to dust before our eyes not quite not quite but like literally I can't handle it

1787
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:48,800
Oh, wait, sorry a countertop. It's bunker in scotland

1788
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:53,920
But uh the kitchen countertop is what you call it smile

1789
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:57,120
We call it a bunker. I I know I know

1790
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,440
Why why Scottish people? Why do you call it a bunker? I don't know

1791
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:08,960
It's just how it is. It's called a bunker the the kitchen countertop the worktop the whatever the bench the kitchen bench

1792
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:11,040
maybe you call it

1793
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:13,120
I want to pass on by strong his thighs

1794
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:18,880
50 that convention. I'll make all my travels expenses back. I'll have a little sign

1795
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,360
50 cents to be stepped on

1796
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:25,840
A dollar to be a thigh crushed until you pass it. That's terrible

1797
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,800
I mean, honestly, it would be a way to get your money back, right? I am fully

1798
01:53:31,120 --> 01:53:33,520
I have fully accepted this run isn't happening

1799
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:46,080
I'm gonna start beatboxing to cool

1800
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:54,880
Oh my god, you can squeeze the lid with the palm of your hand. I don't have any grip strength either

1801
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,520
Could you could you imagine

1802
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:05,840
Imagine no grip strength. You know when people always make fun of folk for having a weak handshake

1803
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:08,960
Imagine the weaker grip

1804
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:15,520
I mean I could I could probably grip it like a vice if I wanted to but my like it hurts

1805
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:21,680
It hurts everything although my gran had absolutely terrible arthritis in her hands

1806
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,080
And unfortunately, I'm gonna teach you a fun fact about biology

1807
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,880
If you are a chick

1808
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:39,280
Wait, whatever your dad's gran has in ailments, you are almost like 100 likely to get it

1809
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:42,560
However, your mom's gran

1810
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:47,360
ailments aren't necessarily always going to be passed on to you

1811
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,120
But if it's your dad's mom or your dad your gran on your dad's side

1812
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,800
Then you're very likely to catch those ailments if you're born a chick

1813
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:01,920
That only applies to chick. Is this a scientific fact? Yes, because

1814
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:08,960
Uh, oh my god. Sorry. I love I'm prompted biology lesson. Let's go. Um, so if you didn't know the male

1815
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:14,480
The sperm determines the sex of the child of the fetus

1816
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,960
Um, and because of that the male can only pass on a fully

1817
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,320
Full so it's x and y chromosome, right?

1818
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:29,600
So the dad passes on an x or a y a y is a hundred percent him an x is a hundred percent his mom

1819
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:34,800
He has no female x inside him if that makes sense. So it's a hundred percent your gran

1820
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:39,680
It sounds really bizarre, but basically I'm like a hundred percent of my I

1821
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:43,120
It's a weird mix. It's really cool though. I absolutely

1822
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:49,600
Absolutely love biology when it comes to that your mom is always an x your mom will always give you an x

1823
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:54,240
So like the reason why men have nipples is to pass down genetic information

1824
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:58,800
For breastfeeding. That's why some men actually end up having like breast tissue

1825
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:04,320
It's completely natural completely normal men are a hundred percent susceptible to breast cancer as well

1826
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:10,240
Please do not think you are immune if you ever find a lump or anything. Do not be embarrassed

1827
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:15,840
I assure you you are not the only man on earth that may ever have a lump in their breast. This is

1828
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:19,680
It is perfectly natural. It is perfectly normal. Do not be embarrassed

1829
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,120
I cannot

1830
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:27,680
Emphasize how much any healthcare worker has seen everything at the point at the point you present your symptoms

1831
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,960
The healthcare worker has seen everything

1832
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:32,880
Okay

1833
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:36,720
No, your genetic can be really messed up. You can have like disorders and all that

1834
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:39,680
Um

1835
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,680
I have tds to potentially have dark

1836
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:46,560
Yes, you need to pass on the genetic mammary gland information because mammals are

1837
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,920
Um milk producing so some

1838
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:55,200
Animals take a chicken for example a little chicken gets all its nutrients from the egg

1839
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:00,320
It's all it'll need. It does not need a milk supply. It uses a yolk sac for example to grow

1840
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,080
Um, whereas mammals are term

1841
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:08,080
Usually are born a much younger much

1842
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:16,240
Unable to do things especially humans are a fantastic example of mammals being unable to do anything for a very long time

1843
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:20,800
But the reason for that is because the circumference of the head of the baby

1844
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:26,400
Um babies need to be born essentially before full gestation

1845
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:32,160
Because it would um perish the mother so humans evolved to

1846
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:35,760
Give birth around the nine month mark. But actually

1847
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:42,000
Fun factoid the embryo normally is 10 months old by the time it comes out

1848
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:45,920
Yes, the brain still needs to develop a massive example of

1849
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:49,360
Um, the development stage is called ossification

1850
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:56,080
Um children are born with a lot more bones than adults end up with and um

1851
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:59,440
ossification is the process of your

1852
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:03,920
Bones um coming together a fusing together

1853
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,240
Which is why babies cannot crawl until usually the six month mark

1854
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:14,240
But uh milestones and children aren't necessarily an indication of good health bad health

1855
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,960
Everyone is different. That is why um

1856
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:25,520
A lot of mothers in healthcare are ossification no ossification like oseph something like that

1857
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,600
I can't spell the rest of it

1858
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,000
But

1859
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,200
Yeah, like um

1860
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:36,080
That's why like you might have a story saying like I completely skip the crawl phase

1861
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:39,600
Some children completely skip the crawl phase. They don't even need to do it

1862
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,040
Um, they have no desire to do it and then they'll just up and walk

1863
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:48,800
Um after a certain amount of months has formed. It's fantastic. Honestly, it's quite fascinating

1864
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:54,320
Um to think like I'm sure you guys might have funny stories that your mom was all freaked out being like

1865
01:58:54,400 --> 01:59:02,320
Ah my poor baby boy wasn't doing this and that and it's like no, it's fine. Don't be silly the only cause for concern

1866
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,800
um

1867
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,080
Really is a child that cannot latch

1868
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,120
It's probably the massive are you joking?

1869
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,800
Um

1870
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,800
I need a queen now

1871
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,520
I was gonna go for a flush

1872
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,600
Um

1873
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:29,920
I was a quick talker not a quick walker. Yes, absolutely fun fact skipping the crawl phase is a major sign of dyspraxia

1874
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,840
Condition is hard baby. Literally those can't control forelimbs at once. Yes

1875
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:38,160
That's why you had to do tummy time as well to help raise your neck muscles

1876
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:43,280
Because babies pretty much have knee neck muscles to save their the life of them

1877
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:47,760
They like violently swing their head around just like so crazy

1878
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,200
Um, oh what am I gonna try and achieve here?

1879
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,360
I was gonna go for a flush with hearts, but I only have two discards left

1880
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:00,720
And I've got a bit of a high thing going on here

1881
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:06,960
I was cartwheeling out of the wind feels good man. Honestly come flying out

1882
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:13,360
Well, I actually got four of a kind which is so rare

1883
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:18,960
Sorry, I got so distracted I stopped playing the game. Um

1884
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:23,680
Hmm

1885
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:33,840
Hmm, have I just shot myself in the foot doing such a pit manoeuvre

1886
02:00:38,640 --> 02:00:40,640
I think we're gonna have to get rid of them

1887
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,200
Yeah, I'm gonna say try and go for doubles like this

1888
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:47,680
Hmm, I don't lose honestly

1889
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:53,920
Uh, this is definitely not oh, of course, he's ready to pop now when I didn't need him

1890
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,120
No, these are rubbish. I mean

1891
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,480
At least we win but I didn't he need

1892
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,920
Oh

1893
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:09,760
Well, I guess pop on the jack then I didn't even realize we were up against that thing

1894
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:16,640
But that's funny. Okay. We did it. We did it somehow. We did it a christmas freaking miracle 11 dollar. He does

1895
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:23,280
Will we go out for two pairs

1896
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,840
I think we're gonna shape our deck with two pairs shout out to all my pairs

1897
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,680
You're the only thing keeping us alive right now

1898
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:43,440
So does splash not complement two pairs

1899
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,600
I don't oh I do not

1900
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:54,240
Does splash not complement two pairs? I don't know. I don't know

1901
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,520
We're gonna have to shape it now

1902
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,840
We don't have a choice

1903
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,840
Splash works for extra two cards

1904
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:09,440
Then what get rid of loyalty card? No, not really splash is good if you have a lot of junk cards

1905
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:11,760
Mmm

1906
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:22,080
All right, we're shape we're gonna have to shape it now or we are basically accept and defeat

1907
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,560
So you'll have to forgive me

1908
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:30,320
I'm going to do something very painful and you're not gonna like it

1909
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:36,400
And you're not gonna like it

1910
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:41,440
But we have to do it now or else we have lost lost

1911
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:46,720
We're going for two pairs. So let's go for uranis. Of course. It doesn't show up because why would it

1912
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,360
Because why would it show up right now?

1913
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:52,080
Why would it show up?

1914
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:55,520
Why not sell the egg? It's currently giving me a 10 plus at the moment

1915
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:58,480
Um

1916
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:01,040
Until we get

1917
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,160
Don't mind if I do

1918
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:10,080
Don't mind if I do you're not gonna like it, but we're going for two pairs shout out to all my pairs

1919
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:21,920
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right my baby don't mess around because

1920
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,040
Because it's out for show

1921
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:28,240
Oh, and that joker just came in

1922
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:31,040
These two are gonna come in clutch pretty much

1923
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:37,360
Yep, and I got an uranis, which is exactly what I wanted to see. We're doing it. We're we're going in two pairs two pairs

1924
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:39,520
It just seems to be the matter

1925
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:41,520
What are you mister?

1926
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Oh

1927
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,520
I'm coming. Oh

1928
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,320
Great. Okay

1929
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,440
Egg you have done us

1930
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:56,320
Christmas miracles, but your time is up

1931
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:00,720
Your time is up

1932
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:03,760
Your time is up. Oh my god

1933
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:06,640
Right, come on uranis

1934
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:10,640
Yep. Okay. Okay. We shaped it at the most perfect time

1935
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:15,040
How are we looking we want to do highs maybe

1936
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,560
Ain't nothing can you teach us more about this female biology?

1937
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:26,640
I was actually gonna do a sex education stream just for the hell of it. Um, because I quite find I find it quite fascinating

1938
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,360
Hmm

1939
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:36,480
Sure

1940
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:43,840
Um after play or discard always draw three cards like more

1941
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:50,480
After player discard always draw three cards like three cards only

1942
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:56,000
I know there's a flush there, but we're going for doubles so

1943
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:07,600
We learned so much every stream. Well, I was gonna this sounds absolutely terrible. I was going to get a pair of

1944
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:14,720
Basically model balls and like I was gonna do ASMR like examining your

1945
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:18,080
Um

1946
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:22,080
But obviously with youtube kind of switching things up. I guess that might be a twitter video

1947
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:25,920
Actually, I remember many I need to put that video on twitter. I'm so sorry

1948
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,760
I don't know why I keep coming up with cursed ideas, but I can't help it like it's fucking hilarious

1949
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:36,560
I'm like I'm sorry, but imagine like ASMR me with my hands like and I've like got my nails on like oh

1950
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:40,960
Sorry, I forgot to put my gloves on he he no pay no patient contact direct contact. Sorry

1951
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,200
And I'll be like oh lovely nice and shaved for me. Thank you

1952
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:48,080

1953

That curse it's all good. We're into it. Literally. I'm like I can't stop coming up with like these silly gives me ideas

1954
02:05:55,120 --> 02:05:57,120
It just makes me giggle so much

1955
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:02,560
I don't know like it. It just brings me so much joy, right? So we have three

1956
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:09,360
We have three to turn into hearts, which I'm actually gonna oh wait hold on

1957
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:15,520
We actually want more hearts because of this little guy. Oh wait idea. There was another one that has a diamond

1958
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:24,960
That's okay to be dumb. I'm allowed to be dumb. I'm allowed to be dumb

1959
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:32,000
Being dumb is not bad being bad. It doesn't mean I'm dumb. Well, I am dumb, but you know what I mean

1960
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:40,080
All I can think of you going to whip no no like I would be like proper like whispering ASMR like

1961
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:43,760
Just be like thank you for coming to the clinic. You got any concerns? I see

1962
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,040

1963
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,320
You're too late

1964
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:54,640
You're too late the disrespect you have shown me you're too late

1965
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,640
Greedy Joker lusty Joker

1966
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,120
Clever Joker

1967
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:06,160
Mad Joker clever. I remember I used to always get called the clever girl in primary school

1968
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:08,160
to be like, oh, you're such a clever girl scrawny

1969
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:12,320
Self-right you're complimenting me mr. Teacher. Well, miss teacher

1970
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:16,480
If it's a miss if it's a miss relax relax relax, right?

1971
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:19,440
Relax no play

1972
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,440
It's called a humor

1973
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Square Joker should I get it?

1974
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:30,080
I don't know. I feel like it's too late for him. Like I've got three plus multiplier when certain car a plus

1975
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:34,560
Not times, but he just gives four check like you're too late, bro

1976
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:39,040
Bro, you're actually too late for bro. Right. We're gonna skip because we're getting a negative Joker

1977
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,600
All heart cards are debuff. That's fine

1978
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,520
That's absolutely fine with me. Are you kidding me?

1979
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:52,400
You're telling me that I don't have a second double

1980
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,800
I

1981
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:06,960
Right, we're just playing doubles. I know that's the buffed and that's the buffed as well

1982
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:10,480
I know I know play the flush

1983
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:14,880
No, I have to go in on doubles everything is stark for doubles now

1984
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:17,920
so I can't

1985
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:20,640
I have to be a good girl and play doubles

1986
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,360
We can't be tempted ill of fate

1987
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,560
We must be good. Okay

1988
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:33,360
Is there not double have I thrown so many cards away? There's no doubles. Oh, there's oh wait idiot. There's one right there

1989
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:39,600
It's cuz it's blanked out. Okay. It's cuz they're blanked out. I'm dumb

1990
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:44,000
All these curse medically some words are just gonna be in different rooms of the same building

1991
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,800
Literally, right. What are you?

1992
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:53,120
That's a shame, but I mean a Joker is a Joker

1993
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:55,360
If it's a flush

1994
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:00,400
Yeah, that's a shame. That's a shame. That's a shame

1995
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:07,600
But we're gonna start redeeming packs. Our economy is good to go honestly. Sure. What's a turret if it's not a carrot?

1996
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,760
And oh we can get 20 bucks back a steel card

1997
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,840
Steel cards might be your saving grace

1998
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:17,840
I

1999
02:09:20,560 --> 02:09:23,360
Dare I say a steel card might be your saving grace

2000
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:28,240
If we can get a few more steel cards, uh, I would not be upset

2001
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:34,320
What we looking at what we looking at creates two copies of one selected card in your hand

2002
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:41,360
Diamond creates two copies of the selected card

2003
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,720
Whoa, wait, that's

2004
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:46,000
Three tall

2005
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I'm by that anyway

2006
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:53,680
And then let's go again what we're going here next base shop is a polychrome

2007
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,280
I'm full

2008
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:02,320
There's no more room at the end. You can only tempt me with negative jokers now

2009
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:07,120
Unless I sacrifice one of these for it

2010
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,560
Oh

2011
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:14,320
Oh, I'm sacrificing. I'm sacrificing so hard right now

2012
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:21,360
On top of that the doctor one running between the room is changing outfits honestly

2013
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:29,520
Um, right. I will if I have three aces of diamond, I'll get rid of um the heart joker

2014
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:35,760
Are you just like saws but the game actually is

2015
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:38,640
going against me

2016
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:44,240
Just say you hate me. It's fine. Just say you don't like me. You don't you don't have to spell it out with the cards

2017
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:47,200
Okay, there we go

2018
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:54,960
Greedy and lusty are plus three easy to repair. Yeah, I'm gonna swap out lust

2019
02:10:56,560 --> 02:11:00,000
For whatever this hidden guy is what are you?

2020
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:02,720
Play dices

2021
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:04,000
Okay

2022
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,920
Right. Goodbye lusty. You've done is pretty good to get here

2023
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,200
Oh wait, you won't

2024
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:16,720
I

2025
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:21,840
No point in getting rid of him because I mean he might come in clutch somewhere

2026
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:26,880
You need to go there then you're at 1.5. So you need to go over

2027
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:36,160
And then we hope for urinus. Oh my a bit of urinus don't mind if I do

2028
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:41,840
Uh, and then a full house technically contains a doubly. So I'll take it

2029
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:48,240
I miss tours again, but how's it going? It's going good ish. We won our first move

2030
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:51,600
We had to pivot in the middle of this one

2031
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:54,240
There is a chance

2032
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:57,600
There is a chance, but we're having to

2033
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:01,360
Be very

2034
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:03,840
Mmm

2035
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:13,360
We're having to be on our best behavior

2036
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:18,240
Because this isn't easy

2037
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:22,080
I would like to keep you

2038
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:27,360
We're having we're going it all in on two pairs yet again. It seems to be the best strategy

2039
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,840
Just two pairs over and over again

2040
02:12:30,640 --> 02:12:32,640
Um

2041
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,600
Just because just because

2042
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,640
Oh my god urinus fantastic

2043
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,720
It's not guaranteed though

2044
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:52,080
It's definitely not guaranteed. What do you do not discovered? I mean we'll discover it because we can

2045
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:56,720
Um

2046
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:59,280
Playing cards, maybe if we can get another one of them

2047
02:13:00,720 --> 02:13:02,720
What are you? Whoa

2048
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,880
That's op is fuck

2049
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:14,720
Yeah, sorry, I know it's a low number, but that's so op

2050
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:20,080
Hey, we are just gonna go on a bit of a buying. Oh, we got the fill

2051
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:28,880
We're gonna use the fill. I'm sorry. We're gonna use it. It's it's keeping us above the requirements for the round

2052
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:38,640
Hand size next very large blind. I can't swap that out. So we're gonna have to hopefully level up urinus

2053
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:45,280
No one else is sorry, let me check the lens

2054
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:53,520
Net and well, there's no point in that because it doesn't work. Um, low number doesn't matter when you're stacking ballies anywhere. Yeah

2055
02:13:57,200 --> 02:14:05,200
Oh when blind is selected gain three, but lose all this. Whoa, that is punishing. Why would anyone want that?

2056
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,440
Oh

2057
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:15,840
Okay, an ace gives me a bit extra on top two pair two pair

2058
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:24,960
On a diamond, okay, we're in it. We're in it to win it. I don't know if we have it. It's not guaranteed. Oh, okay

2059
02:14:28,160 --> 02:14:33,280
We want to level up urinus. We really do. Sorry, I know I keep calling it urinus

2060
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,120
Okay, that's good

2061
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,920
We get a level up as well, which is absolutely fantastic

2062
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:49,840
What are you when blind is like to create two no and then a straight no

2063
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:54,240
Urinus again any urin any urinuses? Whoa

2064
02:14:58,480 --> 02:15:00,480
Hello, yeah

2065
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:05,600
Big beak close enough, okay

2066
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:12,000
By okay, okay black hole all hands plus one now curious

2067
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:17,760
Curious indeed, right we will spend everything after this

2068
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:22,240
We will spend every penny we can muster

2069
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:29,520
Now we do have a 1.5 in here as well. So we are gonna play and throw with seven

2070
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:32,480
Try and get higher doubles

2071
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:40,320
Yeah, yeah, okay, and then we'll play our aces and our tens and we've done that round

2072
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:46,720
How much does that get okay, we definitely need ace plays

2073
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:51,520
In order to do this big bang right we can sell everything

2074
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:56,400
Urinus any urinuses close enough absolutely. We've got one

2075
02:15:56,400 --> 02:16:05,680
Two turret cards, let's see what we're looking at and now give me us we can go all out on urinus

2076
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:19,600
Someone says yeah, right we'll use the urinus so we're gonna use that now that's perfect and then we've got

2077
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:27,280
So like two cards convert the left into the right

2078
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:35,680
Do we want another two?

2079
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:46,960
Selling the left joker make another steal. That's what I'm thinking as well

2080
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:58,000
What are we looking at for the lower numbers other the odds of everything is actually on par other than higher aces and jacks

2081
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:05,760
Turn the four into a steal, okay, and let's just slight two cards convert the left into the right

2082
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,760
Okay, we now have two a lot twos

2083
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:12,320
Give him a lot enema enema give him an enema

2084
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:15,200
um

2085
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,760
No

2086
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:20,720
Mm-hmm

2087
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:23,520
Creates a copy of a joker destroys a whoa

2088
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:25,440
No

2089
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:29,680
What creates a copy of a random, but destroys all other jokers

2090
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:35,280
No, I think you need to show up a lot earlier than that. Are you couldn't we couldn't even do anything

2091
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:39,760
We're out of money

2092
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
We didn't even get anything for that

2093
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,960
Hmm

2094
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:50,000
Okay, hold on we are gonna take our sweet

2095
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:53,520
our

2096
02:17:53,520 --> 02:17:55,520
time

2097
02:17:56,960 --> 02:17:58,960
I

2098
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:01,520
Say

2099
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:07,760
I say get rid of these

2100
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:10,080
And keep

2101
02:18:13,040 --> 02:18:15,040
No

2102
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:18,160
Get rid of all of these. I know it's a pair

2103
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:22,240
But we need the ace

2104
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:27,360
Anke is good early. Yeah

2105
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:32,480
How's the gambadix go in we might win or lose. I'm not sure

2106
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:42,160
We need the aces okay, that's exactly what we needed. However, we don't have a complimentary pair

2107
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:46,960
So we're gonna do another discard

2108
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:51,600
Okay, okay, we're cooking by gas

2109
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:57,920
Shout out to all my pairs. We're gonna throw away the eight and we're gonna see what this ace does

2110
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:05,360
Um

2111
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:09,920
Okay

2112
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,280
I'm not

2113
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:18,960
Mmm

2114
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:23,520
Oh aces in snowberries we're gambling don't look don't

2115
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:39,360
Hi snowberries. Hi, I say thank you for redirecting into me. I appreciate you kindly

2116
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:46,880
Um, hello snowberries. We're gambling today because yesterday I was emotionally distraught after finishing john wick

2117
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:52,000
Do not finish don't watch john wick if you're not emotionally stable. That's all I'm gonna say all I thought

2118
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:56,640
John wick was about pew pew. Ha ha cool guy. Uh, no, don't do that

2119
02:19:57,440 --> 02:20:01,600
Bye hi readers. Thank you for joining in. How was aces streamed? Did you enjoy it?

2120
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:04,560
If I can pull a steel card

2121
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:06,800
We might be out the gutter

2122
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:13,200
We are currently on the very last round of a run on a deck that we haven't done a one a win on

2123
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:17,120
It's a very large bind at 300

2124
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:22,640
We will win or we will riot is sevens here better instead of tens because of the diamonds

2125
02:20:23,520 --> 02:20:25,520
I don't know

2126
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,800
A stream was a cluster

2127
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:36,400
What did she do was it it was an ASMR that stream the ac was streaming was it?

2128
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,400
greedy joker

2129
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:45,280
Is it better with a diamond played cards with diamond give plus three

2130
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:50,480
We could hold off and use that then

2131
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:56,160
Oh, you're playing oh, that's right. You were playing guild wars because her

2132
02:20:56,880 --> 02:21:03,120
Her streaming equipment had to be on the lowest setting bless her cotton socks. I yes, I recall now. I recall

2133
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:12,240
And I didn't shoot yeah, okay, I recall yeah her she had to put it on the lowest graphics. I recall I recall

2134
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:18,240
Also, we gave her a wedding dress and a ring. Oh, and you ran a train on her excuse me

2135
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:24,240
I beg your finest pardon. You did what in to my icy

2136
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:27,840
You ran a train on my daughter

2137
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:32,720
Excuse me

2138
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:38,960
You you dressed her up like a Barbie doll in a wedding dress and gave her a ring

2139
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
And then you ran a train on my daughter

2140
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:46,400
And you didn't invite me into the culture. Excuse me

2141
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:51,120
There was a dog pile at some point you ran a train on ac

2142
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:55,760
We're at her official daddas now. I'll have you know, okay

2143
02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:58,640
daddas, okay

2144
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,560
You guys have so many nicknames snowberries daddas ojisans

2145
02:22:03,440 --> 02:22:06,000
I like ojisans because of my accent. I'm like, oh

2146
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:10,960
Come in a side ojisans like my accent makes this a stronger

2147
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,520
The culture spot was taken rude

2148
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
That's my chair. I'll have you know

2149
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,080
What was that about chair?

2150
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:20,720
Right, we're doing it. We're doing it

2151
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:25,920
We've got an ace. We've got a diamond to activate on both these the eight will not count

2152
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,360
And we've got one hand remaining so we need to

2153
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:37,760
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Oh, what does it mean?

2154
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,480
I have the odds to pull one more ace

2155
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:47,440
I have to go for the ace

2156
02:22:55,920 --> 02:23:02,160
Oh my god, this is so close. This is come on game. Give me the ace streamer luck. Oh

2157
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:07,760
Okay, okay. We have pulled the ace. I repeat we have pulled the ace

2158
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:16,400
We might as well discard the lore in case of a diamond pool of 10

2159
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:22,320
In case of a diamond pool on 10

2160
02:23:25,360 --> 02:23:27,360
Yes

2161
02:23:28,720 --> 02:23:35,520
I might as well get rid of the jack and I might as well get rid of the king and pull for diamond 10

2162
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:45,040
Yep. Yep. This is the best way to do it and maybe a steal

2163
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:52,480
Unlucky well we can submit our jacks then

2164
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,720
They didn't pull the two such a shame they didn't pull the two

2165
02:23:58,720 --> 02:24:00,720
I

2166
02:24:04,960 --> 02:24:12,960
Want to use the tens for scholar scholar scholar played aces give

2167
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:20,080
This is it. This is the best we can do

2168
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:22,160
I

2169
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:30,000
Throw the two out there. Why not? I'm just giving them a little two

2170
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:36,560
We don't even have anything like that. I just give them a two as a tip. Okay

2171
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:41,280
Okay, well

2172
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:45,840
Let's see

2173
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,400
Do we do it

2174
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:51,360
Do we do it? Oh

2175
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,040
Hey

2176
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,720
No

2177
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:07,120
Oh

2178
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:26,160
We say a ball here in scots like oh if it's really close you go. Oh, that was a ball here

2179
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:28,480
right

2180
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:32,080
One more run and then I'm going to redirect into she be because

2181
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:38,400
This is a shorter stream because I am uploading the girls as highlights from debut

2182
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:41,120
I'm just going to check if the she be streaming cotton bum

2183
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:46,880
A bit of she be cotton bum. Yeah, she might be live. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Is she having a break today? Yeah

2184
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:50,160
Oh my gosh. She's having a break. How did I can't believe it?

2185
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:55,280
I can't believe the girls that be allure are making sure they're healthy and okay, uh

2186
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:59,840
Uh on emmy's off emmy's off as well. Okay. Um

Uh, uh, okay. Okay. Hold on

02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:08,160
So it's mersey on or am I the last one up? I'm the last one off

2189
02:26:09,440 --> 02:26:10,720
Oh, no

I

2194
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:30,960
Could in theory

2195
02:26:31,120 --> 02:26:32,800
go away for

2196
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:34,160
five

2197
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:36,560
It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work. Vila is gone

2198
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:40,560
Vila is gone. We can't do it. Right. Hold on. Let's play one more deck

2199
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:44,880
Uh

2200
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:48,400
Wow, okay. Let's play one more deck and then we'll redirect into the

2201
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:52,320
A yumi plus girl because there'd be nothing but kind and lovely to us

2202
02:26:52,880 --> 02:27:00,320
Uh, what about ac ac redirected into me vila has fallen literally everyone like oh, how can I possibly keep up with vila streams?

2203
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:02,400
Well, you can now

2204
02:27:02,400 --> 02:27:03,680
She

2205
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:06,320
Okay, I will make a deal we'll play one more round

2206
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:09,600
I'm gonna very quickly make a cup of tea and go for a pee we'll play one more round

2207
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:12,800
We'll redirect into a yumi plus girl once I go offline

2208
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:17,600
You will start to notice that the highlights of the girl's debuts go up again

2209
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:21,920
I will do it in order of who debuted first. So it goes ac and azura then

2210
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:25,760
Mercy then emmy then she be then me last. Okay

2211
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:29,200
So they're all gonna pop up roughly at the same time

2212
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,360
Like uh, maybe 15 minutes apart because it takes a while to fucking do all the descriptions

2213
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
But please do look out for that

2214
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:38,640
Do I want a cup of tea?

2215
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:40,640
I don't know. I'm a feeling a cup of tea

2216
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:43,520
Or do I just want to go again?

2217
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:45,840
The plane has hit vila headquarters

2218
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:49,920
And the funny thing is we actually do have a headquarters, which is the most funniest

2219
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:56,800
We we considered accepting mail at the headquarters location on behalf of the girls, but it's not possible

2220
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,520
Um

2221
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:05,120
We thought about it because we were we discussed having po boxes

2222
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:11,760
But um, unfortunately with the rise of air tags and trackers we cannot accept mail at anyone

2223
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:17,040
I said to the girls I was like not then you open up po boxes. I understand if you're interested

2224
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:19,920
At first I was gonna test it out myself. Um

2225
02:28:21,440 --> 02:28:27,920
Because I can get packages sent to the headquarters. I know that sounds fucking ridiculous, but there is like, I know

2226
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:30,320
Yeah, believe it or not. Um

2227
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:32,320
But then I was like

2228
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:35,200
I would have to open up all the packages

2229
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:39,440
At the headquarters location to make sure there's no air tags or anything

2230
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:41,920
Um, or any biohazard stuff

2231
02:28:42,720 --> 02:28:46,000
And then it was like I was gonna have to rent out a freaking conference room

2232
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:49,040
And then I was gonna have to go through all the packages and then it kind of defeats the

2233
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:52,880
This surprise because like opening stuff up on stream is like quite funny

2234
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:55,440
You want an officer? I mean

2235
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:58,800
I mean

2236
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:02,240
I can give you a boardroom meeting tour if you want man

2237
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:05,280
Like the actual boardrooms

2238
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:09,280
How am I supposed to poison the staff? Why would you want to poison the staff? What the fuck?

2239
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:11,920
I'm part of the staff the fuck

2240
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:18,160
Better keep it safe virtual headquarters. Nope physical location headquarters

2241
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:24,080
Actual physical location headquarters. I know cringe

2242
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:30,720
How did she do it ladies and gentlemen mods just that man's balls mods get that man. Don't leave us moment

2243
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:33,040
Wait, so no cup of tea or cup of tea

2244
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:38,080
Um, you'd also have to check the inside of the item for an air tag. Yeah, like the

2245
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:40,800
It just gets so dangerous

2246
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:44,240
Unless I was to record the video at the headquarters

2247
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:47,840
And then take back what I desired

2248
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:51,840
A new was safe home and I would have to buy like a tracker as well

2249
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:53,840
But tracker devices don't always work

2250
02:29:54,160 --> 02:29:56,160
tracker detector

2251
02:29:56,560 --> 02:30:02,960
Wouldn't you get a higher sniff dog? No, I don't think can dogs sense like motherboards and stuff

2252
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:06,000
And

2253
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:12,640
Yeah, I know it's a shame because I would absolutely enjoy being streamers do like those like accepting your packages type things

2254
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:16,080
And like someone like sprays fart spray or something on it

2255
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:20,960
Although I think one of the sadder ones I caught was like someone sent someone ladybugs

2256
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:26,800
But they all died and I was like that is actually really sad. It's not much of a prank is it if

2257
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,080
We little things perish for it

2258
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:35,520
But you could also just amp the box. Oh, let me just oh, sorry

2259
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:40,080
I forgot to mention have amp grenades just sitting next to my seed collection. Yeah

2260
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:42,080
Um

2261
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:45,280
Don't send live animals or insects in the milk. Yeah, it was like

2262
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:49,280
I can't remember if it made like headlines or whatever

2263
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:56,000
But someone purchased like 10 000 ladybugs and sent it. But obviously, you know, there is no

2264
02:30:57,600 --> 02:30:59,200
um

2265
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:01,200
There was no

2266
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:05,280
Like refrigeration to put them to sleep in the travel

2267
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:09,360
It was like in the heat in the boxes getting thrown about and when they arrive

2268
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:13,920
Obviously, they all had perished and I seem to remember that story in particular because I'm so sad

2269
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:20,640
It feels weird man. As long as there's no iphone within 100 meters. Don't air tags not work. Just open them up and

2270
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:23,520
I have no idea

2271
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:26,800
Sadly doggos can't sniff out an rtx 490

2272
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:32,080
Kind of better that they died. They could be invasive. Uh ladybugs are invasive

2273
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:38,160
Little ladybug little ladybird. We we actually say ladybird in the uk

2274
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:40,480
Little ladybird

2275
02:31:40,480 --> 02:31:45,760
Wouldn't a microwave do this? You want me to microwave everything that comes through in the packages? Just shove it in there

2276
02:31:46,640 --> 02:31:48,640
No, that's fine. It's fine. Just shove in

2277
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:53,680
It depends on the breed

2278
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:55,760
Harley Quinn ladybugs. Okay

2279
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:58,880
I'm gonna name that right

2280
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:05,200
Start the run with no face cards in your deck. Let's see how bad this is and it's called abandoned deck

2281
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:14,800
We do have an uncommon joker for free. So I might be interested in that. What are you after gain 25 economies?

2282
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:25,920
That is more money than we'll make doing that. Right. Fuck it. We're going all in boys. We're going all in

2283
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:31,920
Wait, so we still get aces. We just don't get okay. Okay. So get aces

2284
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:36,880
Uh, let's throw you guys away

2285
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:40,880
Wow, that did nothing. Please don't ever do that again

2286
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:45,120
Okay, we've got a full house. Let's go

2287
02:32:46,880 --> 02:32:51,280
I'm gonna send myself to valer hq. Oh, do you remember that prank?

2288
02:32:52,160 --> 02:32:58,640
Um, we're like these people claim they ship themselves and then an airline had to come out and be like, don't be so effing ridiculous

2289
02:32:58,640 --> 02:33:05,840
Of course these people didn't ship themselves through a fucking box or something because they like it was like a prank youtube channel

2290
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:08,320
And they were oh, yeah, we totally shipped ourselves

2291
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:15,360
And it was like don't be so ridiculous like the airline had to get involved in publicly like denounce them

2292
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:21,360
For being so silly. Wow. Okay. Yes. That was that was definitely worth it. Right. You're free

2293
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:25,600
Sell this card to create a free double tag. What does that even mean?

2294
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:30,320
This joker gains when a booster pack is skipped

2295
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:43,840
Interesting if your airship a living creature is cargo what you get at the other end of the corpse basically

2296
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:51,760
Face cards hardy hardy hard adds double the rank of the lowest card. I mean that's better than nothing

2297
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:56,160
If I skip a booster pack, I mean, I might as well go down there

2298
02:33:56,960 --> 02:34:00,960
Not really fuss for consumable slow at this point in time

2299
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:04,960
What are we up against? Oh, we've got a negative

2300
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:08,400
All heart cards are too fast

2301
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:11,680
Well

2302
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:14,560
Next round I guess

2303
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:20,960
All right, we're gonna go for the negative. We're gonna select a booster pack a booster pack any booster pack lovers

2304
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,640
We'll go for a pair and throw away the four of you

2305
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:31,600
Open tarot and skip it. Oh wait, if you open the the pack and then skip it it adds to it

2306
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:34,400
I thought it meant skip it entirely. Okay, that makes

2307
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:37,200
slightly more sense

2308
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:44,400
Than the way I envisioned it in my head. I'm here. I'm here. I do apologize for that one. Okay. I understand then

2309
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:48,800
This is the first time I've had this guy involved. So we're getting there

2310
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:54,000
Right air in five bucks if three or more face cards

2311
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:04,560
I might as well buy it and sell it I guess

2312
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:10,480
What a joke I skipped for that

2313
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:19,840
Right, so if I buy and then skip it, which is fine. I'm happy to skip that. That's not really a big deal

2314
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:21,600
and skip

2315
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:22,720
Oh

2316
02:35:22,720 --> 02:35:24,720
Whoa, okay

2317
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:26,960
Bye

2318
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,120
What do you do plan out?

2319
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,640
That's actually pretty good. Hold on a minute

2320
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:38,960
Oh, you need to face your problems. I can't believe it. I have no face cards

2321
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:41,520
That's honestly pretty good though

2322
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:47,920
But if I skip

2323
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:50,320
Yeah

2324
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:57,760
I'm going to do the tarot card one because it naturally gives us the goods. I don't really need a consumable swap. So, you know

2325
02:35:58,960 --> 02:36:00,960
already have

2326
02:36:01,440 --> 02:36:06,720
Nine eight seven six five four three two. Of course. I don't have what I need

2327
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:10,480
Give me a seven or something. Whoa

2328
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,960
Uh, you never normally do that for me. So thanks buddy

2329
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:21,520
Ten nine eight seven six, so

2330
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:24,560
You ever do these two?

2331
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:30,560
Sugar I only have one more discard left

2332
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:35,040
So what I need a seven

2333
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:42,640
Are the odds of a seven? Oh seven's pretty high. Fuck it. You know what you know what you cheeky fuck

2334
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:49,600
You cheeky

2335
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:56,160
You cheeky cheeky right, but we've got three more hands. So it's fine. But I need a seven or five or something

2336
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:58,560
Oh

2337
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:02,080
This game has jokes

2338
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:12,880
Nothing but jokes clearly why did I get four there?

2339
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:18,880
What did you I don't know

2340
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:21,360
I mean, I guess

2341
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:24,240
I wasn't even paying attention. Okay

2342
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:31,520
If first hand of round has only one card add a permanent copy to deck and

2343
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:34,000
to deck

2344
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
and you come

2345
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:38,080
and you come

2346
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:40,640
And then again if we

2347
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:44,720
Yeah, if first hand of round

2348
02:37:44,880 --> 02:37:53,680
Has only one card plate add a permanent copy of that card to the deck and draw it to the hand

2349
02:37:57,040 --> 02:37:59,040
Okay

2350
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:01,920
Right, we're gonna skip these to get a little busty-wusty

2351
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:04,240
unless

2352
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:06,240
Should we go out all out on aces?

2353
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:10,480
Fuck it. If it's got an ace, I'm taking it. If it's got an ace, I'm taking it

2354
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:15,440
Uh, we're gonna skip that and then we're gonna add to a little multiplier here

2355
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:18,000
What are you?

2356
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,720
Planet card uncommon joker for free first hand is drawn face down

2357
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,600
right

2358
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:27,600
He's twitching. He's ready

2359
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:32,000
Yeah, we're going all out on aces. Fuck it

2360
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:38,160
She we've got five aces now

2361
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:45,520
The unit works well for four of the kinds of clone 800 aces literally and that's the plan

2362
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:48,400
10 9 8 7

2363
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:54,080
Of course, that was too good to be true. Let's do double b's and five why not?

2364
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:58,960
Surely this is the correct move

2365
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:04,480
Oh, we did it. Oh, wow. Okay. That was good. That was good. Um

2366
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:10,400
Sell the card to disable the current no

2367
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:21,520
So what am I going for? I don't know. I don't really know what I'm going for

2368
02:39:27,360 --> 02:39:29,360
Just skip

2369
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:33,360
I don't really have anything shaping what we want to do at the moment

2370
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,120
Um

2371
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:38,960
Never seen this game before. What's the goal? It's like a

2372
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:43,440
Someone says it's a rogue like but with poker mechanics. Yes

2373
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Um, there's a lot of different aspects to the game. It's gonna look absolutely chaotic right now. Um,

2374
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:53,760
But it's quite an easy and tampering since free money

2375
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,880
You make money forever

2376
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:58,960
Oh

2377
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,120
Yes, basically

2378
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:07,360
I don't know if it's better to skip to keep getting this up. I feel like that's gonna add up over time like really big

2379
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:11,760
I'm sure I'm gonna regret it, but

2380
02:40:12,400 --> 02:40:16,400
Oh wait, I could have got more money to buy more packs. You know what?

2381
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:20,320
I might not be the smartest, but I'm here for a good time again

2382
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:23,520
We're gonna have to skip because we don't even have anything that

2383
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,920
is

2384
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:30,080
Shaping our deck other than this really doubles the lowest

2385
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:35,440
I don't even know what that means and we're gonna try and get more aces. What's going on here?

2386
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:38,880
Did we go for a free joker?

2387
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:45,200
Fuck it

2388
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Oh, this is terrible

2389
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:59,280
Now the odds of us pilling an ace are high so what if we just no don't sell it you give her play

2390
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:06,480
Okay

2391
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:09,920
Okay, okay, okay

2392
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:15,120
Okay

2393
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:17,600
Then we just throw it away

2394
02:41:18,880 --> 02:41:20,880
Which is a shame to do

2395
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,480
Now I'm noticing this one isn't budging anywhere which makes me think it's an ace

2396
02:41:34,080 --> 02:41:39,380
I'm gonna regret this but hey, oh right. We've got a duple V and we'll get rid of the three

2397
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:53,280
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I mean we're kind of looking at two pair again, especially with the amount of aces we're getting

2398
02:41:56,640 --> 02:42:00,560
And we're about to get a Saturn no urenus close enough

2399
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:06,240
Close enough close enough right urenus will level up her two pair rewards

2400
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,800
I can't get away from two pairs. I honestly can't eat

2401
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:13,040
Okay

2402
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:18,400
Not the best

2403
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:21,520
Because we actually want to keep skipping packs that we open

2404
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:25,120
One, you know, we'll just buy everything

2405
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:31,680
Multi-card steel card joker must have room. Well, I just lost room so

2406
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:36,480
You could have tried for a four of a kind on the aces

2407
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:40,800
Yes, we're going to work towards that

2408
02:42:42,480 --> 02:42:44,480
Right, we're gonna buy these and skip them

2409
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,600
a sigil and

2410
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:53,680
Yeah, again, not really a Ouija just sounds like a terrible idea. Converse all cards in hand to a single random suit

2411
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:59,040
No, we're not doing flushes. We're doing double base. We're gonna skip. We've got now plus 15 on this bad boy

2412
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:01,280
Again, we're gonna open up a joker

2413
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:04,480
No

2414
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:08,560
We're gonna skip again. We've just never plus 18. We're absolutely

2415
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:11,920
Having a good time with him. We're gonna see if we're gonna duplicate

2416
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:26,240
Would we give what would we give up sell this card to create a free double tag? What does that even mean?

2417
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:33,840
What is a double tag gives a copy of the next selected tag

2418
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:36,480
So

2419
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:38,720
That what

2420
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:47,620
Next time you skip the effect happens twice

2421
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:02,320
Huh all right you're twitching

2422
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:06,880
You

2423
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:11,680
Steel steel ace

2424
02:44:17,360 --> 02:44:24,160
Beautiful oh that actually played for you a bit of money there a steel card steal the two

2425
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:28,880
And then we've got two multipliers on the deck

2426
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:33,360
And then do what up here

2427
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:43,520
Not the two put it on the sick

2428
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:49,520
Um

2429
02:44:54,640 --> 02:44:57,680
I don't know what to try and roll for maybe another ace

2430
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:04,000
Keep the four try and roll for an ace. Okay. There you go. There you go. Exactly what we wanted

2431
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:10,560
Uh, throw me the two. Um, we've got two. Yeah, hold on. We're gonna end up with you

2432
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:16,560
Hey

2433
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:19,520
How much work was the cola putting in?

2434
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:26,080
That wasn't that really wasn't that good

2435
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:28,320
So

2436
02:45:32,480 --> 02:45:34,480
Hey, I'm gonna lose

2437
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:43,200
The cola did nothing

2438
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:51,920
Oh, but I'm gonna get two holographics if I win though easy win on what show me what four ever came

2439
02:45:56,880 --> 02:45:58,880
There's two more aces to pull

2440
02:46:00,400 --> 02:46:02,400
Could do five of a kind

2441
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:04,720
What should I just try and pull for another ace?

2442
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:11,760
Five of a kind should be more than enough bloody. Oh, so

2443
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:20,240
Oh, there you go. I still could technically get another one. Fuck it. Ah, I could do imagine though

2444
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:27,040
So what I want to do these four and then have the 1.5 and 1.5

2445
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:32,240
I'm okay. We're saying goodbye to the planet. It's not the biggest deal five aces

2446
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:40,720
Oh, that's way stronger. Holy crap. Yeah, that's way stronger

2447
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:45,040
All right

2448
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:53,520
God that was not a rolling smoke though. These two negative jokers we're gonna get they better be good. It not negative

2449
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:57,120
Are you joking me?

2450
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:05,760
Right that's free

2451
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:09,520
So we're gonna get it and then sell it because it's fucking rubbish

2452
02:47:10,480 --> 02:47:15,680
And then we're gonna get the probability one. I know that gives me fat like but it's gonna expire

2453
02:47:16,480 --> 02:47:20,000
I'd rather pick this up than something that expires

2454
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:23,280
You know

2455
02:47:23,280 --> 02:47:25,280
Like at least this is perma

2456
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:28,720
So anytime small player you need to go the back

2457
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:34,480
But you won't plan it any planet card that's used. I might just start buying

2458
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:37,120
Anyway, I start buying

2459
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:43,440
Right, we're just gonna start using cards to get this times up. I know I shouldn't and I should skip but

2460
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:48,160
Fuck we're just ruining our economy for this. It's fine

2461
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:52,160
Right, and then we're gonna skip and then that will raise him a little bit

2462
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:55,440
Play only one. Oh, we've lost

2463
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:03,200
We just need to go for aces

2464
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:08,640
He says yep aces

2465
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:12,320
He says

2466
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:16,480
Shit well, we've only got one hand

2467
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:24,640
Shopping the day, I don't know who got it. I don't think so

2468
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:31,280
Oh my god buy a freaking ball here. Whoa not good

2469
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:35,600
We need we need improvements right now

2470
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,520
Right now we need improvements

2471
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:49,120
We need improvements right now

2472
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
I think raised fist

2473
02:48:56,720 --> 02:48:58,720
We're gonna swap you out for free

2474
02:48:59,680 --> 02:49:03,680
Yeah, sorry you're we're trying with you, but you're not doing enough

2475
02:49:05,760 --> 02:49:07,760
Um

2476
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:11,040
We're

2477
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:14,640
We're needing to level him up. He's gonna come in clutch over time as well

2478
02:49:16,720 --> 02:49:18,720
I

2479
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:23,120
I know we need to skip packs. I know

2480
02:49:23,360 --> 02:49:29,040
I should maybe level up four of a kind five of a kind later do

2481
02:49:36,880 --> 02:49:41,920
I know I should try and hold on to economy, but we're trying to catch up with the demands

2482
02:49:43,280 --> 02:49:46,720
Of the game right now and it's not doing well

2483
02:49:47,680 --> 02:49:49,680
I

2484
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:52,240
1.5 I think

2485
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:59,440
I think yes for 1.5 on something something's gonna get swapped out for a 1.5

2486
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:05,600
What are you cards played previously or debuffed? Okay lucky me wait, so don't play my fucking aces

2487
02:50:08,080 --> 02:50:15,200
Uh three of a kind I could test out. I am not obviously I don't have a I could discard though for an ace

2488
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:18,720
Oh

2489
02:50:19,360 --> 02:50:21,360
Oh

2490
02:50:36,080 --> 02:50:44,320
We leveled up ten wait hold on let's check three of a kind is like a thousand

2491
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:51,600
And then two pairs what's four of a kind four of a kind

2492
02:50:52,880 --> 02:50:56,000
Is weaker so three of a kind for now

2493
02:51:03,280 --> 02:51:05,280
And then another three of a kind

2494
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:10,240
Four of a kind fives they're weaker though

2495
02:51:10,480 --> 02:51:11,600
So

2496
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:19,440
Wait, but this will let me level up four of a kind which I want for the aces because I'm going to keep duplicating the aces

2497
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:22,720
Yes

2498
02:51:23,280 --> 02:51:25,280
I would like to duplicate the aces

2499
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:27,920
Wait what?

2500
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:31,760
Oh no

2501
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:35,120
Oh no, wait what?

2502
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:37,120
Oh

2503
02:51:37,360 --> 02:51:39,360
Oh no

2504
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:42,160
I should have used the three of a kind sorry

2505
02:51:44,240 --> 02:51:48,240
I messed that up. Oh, I thought maybe we could have had that. Oh, we got joker unlock

2506
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:51,120
Sell a total of 50 cards upgrade the

2507
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:54,960
Upgrade the level of the first discarded poker hand each round

2508
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:57,760
interesting

2509
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:59,120
Oh

2510
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:04,080
Chat didn't math I didn't math either. So the high table scammed you exactly

2511
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:10,720
Not discovered purchaser use this card in an unceded run to learn what it does. I like that

2512
02:52:11,360 --> 02:52:16,320
We messed up. No, it's okay. I actually thought that was the best choice because I would have got two

2513
02:52:17,280 --> 02:52:18,960
um

2514
02:52:18,960 --> 02:52:25,200
Two upgrades for four of a pair and because I've been going crazy on the aces that actually would have came in quite well

2515
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:31,200
Um, I am going to redirect into yumi plus girl

2516
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:34,160
Um because

2517
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:38,560
I am going to upload everyone's highlights

2518
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:41,360
From debut

2519
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:47,520
So I hope you're ready to look at them. So even though the girls are offline. It doesn't count. Okay

2520
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:51,760
Oh meadow's doing a zomboid meadow plays zomboid

2521
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:56,000
I remember trying to play that and oh lord

2522
02:52:56,720 --> 02:52:58,720
I

2523
02:52:59,280 --> 02:53:03,680
Zura is taking today off question mark. Hold on. Azura do they

2524
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:09,280
Is she definitely taking today off or is she about to go alive?

2525
02:53:10,720 --> 02:53:13,600
Whoa, oh that's another three hours away

2526
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:19,360
Azura forgive me, but I need to upload all your videos

2527
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:26,720
Um, okay, apparently zura is coming up in three hours for anyone who is lurking in the shadows

2528
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:30,000
I am going to go off because I'm going to make some ASMR videos in the background

2529
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:34,400
I'm going to upload the girls highlight reels and please do check them out when you see them drop

2530
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:39,360
Thank you so so much for keeping me company. I do understand. I was supposed to play runescape endurance

2531
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:45,280
Um, that will come later. We are very close to 99. I think one more endurance and we're at 99

2532
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:50,000
Um tomorrow for me is the binding of Isaac

2533
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:55,200
We're going to try and win on an eden run and I can show you my save file and how much progress I've made in it

2534
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:56,480
Um

2535
02:53:56,480 --> 02:54:03,120
And we might try a lily's greed mode. I enjoy greed mode seems like not everyone enjoys it

2536
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:08,080
But lily's greed mode is super duper easy. She's watch me not even win a game tomorrow

2537
02:54:08,480 --> 02:54:14,640
Um, and then we're doing a watch along of the first a membership watch along my apologies of the first

2538
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:16,320
iron man

2539
02:54:16,320 --> 02:54:24,000
um, so do grab iron man movie if you can via your streaming service that you pay for and

2540
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:32,480
Uh, and that is the on tondra for anyone who wasn't here right at the start of stream

2541
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:38,960
Um, I do have my schedule as I am looking for right this very second

2542
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:42,240
Of course, I can't see it so that would be too easy

2543
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:44,800
Where is it?

2544
02:54:48,560 --> 02:54:50,560

There we go for those of you who weren't at the very start. This is what I'm getting up to next week

2547
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:08,160
Um, I'm having shorter streams. There's no endurance stream planned unless you count

2548
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:12,080
Um, apparently spirals play time is like

2549
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:18,560
Five hours straight is five hours as well. So if you want to count those as endurance, you're more than welcome to

2550
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:21,440
Um, I just burped when I said in there

2551

I'm also playing the jelly bean game is my stream snipe game. So you're more than welcome to join me

2552
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:30,800
And downloading fall guys. Um, it's a hoot and a holler

2553
02:55:31,280 --> 02:55:34,640
Uh, I may have to beg you guys to let me into the second round again

2554
02:55:34,960 --> 02:55:38,640
Um, but yes, please don't be afraid to

Download fall guys and stream snipe me. I will tell you the code everything will be all good

And we'll have an amazing time. I will update everyone's channel very shortly

2557
02:55:48,800 --> 02:55:53,520
Um, there's no gamble planned for next week. I can't believe it. No gamble

2558
02:55:54,640 --> 02:55:57,680
Um cameo, we're gonna play which is a childhood game

2559
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:01,760
We're gonna do a member script writing stream of a alternative script

2560
02:56:02,080 --> 02:56:09,920
But I'm going to do a public writing ASMR collabs. I'm going to do one-on-one ASMR collabs with everyone in velour

2561
02:56:10,640 --> 02:56:15,760
Um, and I I'm going to write it live and you can suggest what you want us to say. Okay

2562
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:18,400
I gambled the house and I won a cockroach

2563
02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:20,880
honestly, um

2564
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:22,560
and

2565
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:24,560
the members streams

2566
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:26,960
We've got a script writing

2567
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:31,760
We've got a watch long of night at the museum, which is like this comedy and it had the

2568
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:35,680
I've not seen it in many a year many a year indeed

2569
02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:43,120
There's a members ASMR stream and then there's a members video game. It's not gonna be that long the members video game. I'm just gonna

2570
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:47,920
Just gonna talk about it and why I like the game. We'll play it for a little bit

2571
02:56:47,920 --> 02:56:52,160
But I'll kind of dive in a bit more why we're doing 60 seconds. Um

2572
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:55,840
But yeah, uh nice stacked week, uh, not many

2573
02:56:55,840 --> 02:57:00,160
Endurances so for those of you who are perishing at the thought of an endurance stream

2574
02:57:00,480 --> 02:57:05,040
You're safe. Uh, and the week after follows, uh, my dad is here

2575
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:10,560
Um, so I'll keep you up to date with like his sleep schedule

2576
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:15,120
Um, because I don't know if I'm gonna have to be like, hi guys

2577
02:57:15,280 --> 02:57:19,200
I can't do ASMR because my dad is snoring in the background. Yay

2578
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:24,240
So hang tight on the ASMR streams for now. I I

2579
02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:30,000
I definitely would urge you to enjoy the ASMR streams for next week

2580
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:32,240
If you're available to come see them

2581
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:39,200
Because there might be a three week break due to my dad snoring and having the loudest snore in all of the world

2582
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:41,120
um

2583
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:46,720
The he is literally the loudest snore ever. It's like the kind of snore like not even the

2584
02:57:49,440 --> 02:57:52,640
Um, and I don't want that in the back of oh, where did that go?

02:57:53,360 --> 02:58:01,120
Oh, and also if you missed it, um, we also decided on the pose that I'm being drawn pregnant with you

2586
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:03,600
Which is the third pose. Yippee

2587

2591
02:58:25,040 --> 02:58:26,480

2592
02:58:26,480 --> 02:58:32,160
But yes, I my ego is prego with you and we'll write the ASMR together and it's gonna be so cute and

02:58:39,440 --> 02:58:43,680
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Oh, I just like the stream. Oh, yeah, I like the stream all over

2595
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:50,240
Um, I think I have a new short out as well. If I'm not mistaken. Oh, uh, something went wrong

2596
02:58:50,800 --> 02:58:54,800
Oh, I've been kicked out of my youtube account. Wow, google. Can you please relax?

2597
02:58:55,360 --> 02:58:57,520
Holy moly. Well, good thing

2598
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:01,280
I don't need to be signed in in order to search if my youtube channel at least

2599
02:59:01,680 --> 02:59:04,720
There might be a new short. Give me a second. Just type it in there

2600
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:13,040
Uh, let's see. Uh, staroni cuttles. Let's see if there was one or not. I can't remember. Holy moly

2601
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:18,320
I'm almost at 9 000 subscribers. I only have freaking two ASMR's

2602
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:22,080
Oh my gosh. Oh, I do

2603
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:29,920
God my voice is very, uh, unique. Let's just say that there you go. I do have a new short out

2604
02:59:29,920 --> 02:59:32,240
It's me, uh, lusting over sheeby's design

2605
02:59:32,800 --> 02:59:36,560
Uh, because of how good it is. Uh, it's just a short little highlight. Nothing major

2606
02:59:36,640 --> 02:59:42,000
So, you know, if you want to watch it leave a little like uh, it's literally 10 seconds and it makes all the difference

2607
02:59:42,640 --> 02:59:47,520
Uh, the the ride never ends staroni. Rob, I'm literally what?

2608
02:59:48,240 --> 02:59:49,440
How many?

2609
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:53,360
I the debt is about to be seven ASMR videos

2610
02:59:53,840 --> 02:59:58,560
And I'm only two ahead right now and I just uploaded the uh, the ear cleaning one

2611
02:59:58,960 --> 03:00:03,200
Which was a hoot and a holler. My debt grows literally just as it does in

2612
03:00:03,760 --> 03:00:08,240
Uh, baltro. My debt is still continuing to grow. Hmm

2613
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:11,760
Hmm

2614
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:14,960
Um

2615
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:19,520
Wait, this is very unique. You will get there. Don't worry. Your shorts are the best. Yeah

2616
03:00:20,480 --> 03:00:25,520
Aesthetic literally aesthetics. No one can tell. Oh she beats it. Nope

2617
03:00:26,640 --> 03:00:28,160
Emmy's up

2618
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:30,000
Oh, but I see up

2619
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Azur is too up

2620
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:34,400
Mary up. No

2621
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:37,360
No

2622
03:00:37,360 --> 03:00:39,360
No is my response

2623
03:00:39,680 --> 03:00:41,680
No

2624
03:00:41,920 --> 03:00:43,920
That's it. That's all you're getting at

2625
03:00:44,800 --> 03:00:47,920
Nope, don't want to hear it. What about the gamba audio? Oh, no

2626
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:50,960
Uh, that's going to be a bit in the future

2627
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:55,280
Uh, for anyone who watched they want to start your own vtuber agency

2628
03:00:55,600 --> 03:01:00,480
If you pause um at the scene where a reference sheet is going in the bin

2629
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:05,040
You can see my old reference sheet. Um, it is very true

2630
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:10,080
That's a little behind the scenes if you saw that chart. Um, I got reference sheets for everyone

2631
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:12,400
But they ended up coming out incorrect

2632
03:01:12,560 --> 03:01:16,480
So I had to get new ones made and I ended up spending a lot of money

2633
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:19,040
And it was a bit of a waste

2634
03:01:19,040 --> 03:01:23,920
But hey, you you live and you learn you I learned so much from uh doing gen one

2635
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:29,440
But if you pause on that chart, you can literally see my old reference sheet and the back panels

2636
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:31,920
I can actually show you the

2637
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:35,040
Okay, sorry

2638
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:40,160
You see the back panel ones you see, um, so you know how I have the green front panely ones

2639
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:42,720
The back panel ones

2640
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:49,120
Uh, we're actually designed to be brown to match my yukata, but uh, we ended up

2641
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:52,240
Um changing it because it looked a bit

2642
03:01:53,440 --> 03:01:58,480
Uh unique on content juice. I never show this. No wonder I never show this that is outrageous

2643
03:01:58,880 --> 03:02:00,880
Who designed that?

2644
03:02:00,960 --> 03:02:02,960
Hey

2645
03:02:02,960 --> 03:02:04,960
It's outrageous. I can't believe I even possible

2646
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:07,840
Anyway, anyway

2647
03:02:08,480 --> 03:02:10,560
Anyway, bikini stream one

2648
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:19,840
Yes, we'll have to find an alternative. Yes, just finished the john wick vaude. Uh, yeah an absolute shambles

2649
03:02:19,840 --> 03:02:23,120
That's why we're gambin today, but please don't worry if you had enough of beltro

2650
03:02:23,440 --> 03:02:28,160
Don't worry. I'm taking a pause on beltro next week. You don't have to worry. It's not coming up again

2651
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:35,600
Does your avatar have a backside too? No, I freaking saw those vtuber models. Sorry. I'm itch am Ible

2652
03:02:36,080 --> 03:02:39,280
I saw those vtuber models where it does like the the butt

2653
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:41,680
um

2654
03:02:41,680 --> 03:02:43,680
and

2655
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:45,520
and what

2656
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:48,640
um, I wanted to get it, but I was well

2657
03:02:49,120 --> 03:02:52,480
YouTube's already put me on a warning so I'm trying to behave as best as I can

2658
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:58,160
So I don't but mommies grippers. Yes, those are my grippers my french tip manicure pedicure

2659
03:02:59,440 --> 03:03:01,040
um, I

2660
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:07,200
I'm going to redirect into the lovely mero who's playing project zomboid. I had no idea

2661
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:10,800
You want a backside of your model show off the huge dumpy?

2662
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:16,640
Honestly, there would be so much on show. I couldn't get away with it because the back of my design

2663
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:19,120
Well, I guess it's like a frilly dress

2664
03:03:20,080 --> 03:03:22,080
But I guess it's not too bad

2665
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:27,360
You should think about hardcore henry for a watch along if you're into action movies

2666
03:03:27,440 --> 03:03:33,200
But filmed entirely in first person. So if you're bad with motion sickness, no, I actually don't get motion sickness

2667
03:03:33,840 --> 03:03:40,320
Apparently azura and mercy do I did not realize how common motion sickness in videos games were

2668
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:42,480
I

2669
03:03:42,480 --> 03:03:47,280
I said, uh, this I guess this is just ignorance, but because I don't know better

2670
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:49,120
um

2671
03:03:49,120 --> 03:03:52,800
I'm just like, oh, it's not a problem for me. So why would it be a problem for the masses?

2672
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:54,960
Oh, um

2673
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:58,640
Buckshot really it's also going to be multiplayer soon tm. I don't know when it drops

2674
03:03:58,720 --> 03:04:01,520

03:04:47,360 --> 03:04:52,480
Uh, I don't even know if greed mode multiplayer is possible. That would be hilarious. How like crazy it gets

Um, can't wait for the highlights to go up. Yeah, thank you

2687

2688
03:05:03,040 --> 03:05:06,880
