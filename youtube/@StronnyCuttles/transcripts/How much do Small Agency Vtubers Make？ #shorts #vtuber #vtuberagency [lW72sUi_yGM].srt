1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
How much money does being a smaller agency VTuber actually make you?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,640
$12,084.03

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,720
Oh, you thought I was gonna ask the question and not actually answer it?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,960
Nah, I don't gatekeep, so let's break it down.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,360
I made $5,265.85 on stream elements.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,040
That's tips during streaming.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,600
$3,456.53 on Patreon.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,920
From the alternative audios I offer on the site.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
Then $3,361.35 from YouTube,

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
which includes memberships, super chats,

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,320
and money generated from ads watched by you, the viewer.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,720
Side note, I stream every single day.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,160
This does not include my 100% cut from Ubu Market Marriage.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,440
This is just my first month,

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,200
so I cannot thank you enough for liking, commenting, and subscribing to support me.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,600
And as always, hold back 30% of your income for the tax man.
