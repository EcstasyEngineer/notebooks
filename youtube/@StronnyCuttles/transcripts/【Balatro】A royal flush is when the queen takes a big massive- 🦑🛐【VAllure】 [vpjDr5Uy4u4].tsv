0	17520	Pessing! This is how I sound over the game, in game audio of BALATRO. Not to be confused
17520	25680	with BALATRO because I can't read. Apparently the card in the middle is actually an A in
25680	32680	the game's title, so it's BALATRO, okay? BALATRO.
32680	41640	Ah! Jeez. The delay on when I click go live is astronomical these days, I don't know what's
41640	53200	going on. Pessing! Dear reflings, please type 1 on your keyboard to show that we're
53200	59120	synced. How was your royal flush? Terrible. I'm baking a loaf of bread because I've got
59120	63800	some issues. Okay, no see that was fast. I think it just takes a couple of minutes for
63800	71040	the dang thing to register. Right, so what I said when I click go live, but I don't think
71040	77560	you heard it, is the game isn't called BALATRO, the game is called BALATRO because it's an
77560	85100	A, the A's in the thumbnail is an A, and I've been calling it BALATRO because I've been
85100	90880	removing the A and the T because of the scots. I'm like, I'll be playing BALATRO, BALATRO,
90880	97480	any BALATRO players? That's her absolute shawls behaviour. Good morning, good evening, good
97480	105720	afternoon, I am none other than your huh, stranny cuddles. Now, originally on the agendination
105720	112400	it was Elden Ring, but unfortunately I have absolutely disastrous news, it's not disastrous,
112400	121800	it's not a big deal. I was up working after my beloved Mercy stream, if you guys did not
121800	127360	know, I got to stream yesterday with Mercy playing Goose game, and it was the worst type
127360	131960	or choice, or choice together if you want to say both words at the same time as I just
131960	139520	did there. It was the worst choice because Mercy has very severe motion sickness and
139520	150200	that camera angle would not stop spinning the entire gameplay, so poor Mercy had to
150200	154600	go, or I sent her off, I wasn't happy with it. But the long and short, if you missed
154600	158960	the Goose game with Mercy and you don't have time to watch the VOD, Mercy did a big scary
158960	164560	burp and both of us recognised what that burp meant and it meant her digestive tract was
164560	169200	getting ready to reverse due to her motion sickness, yeah like her motion sickness when
169200	174560	playing video games, but we had an absolutely fantastic time being Goose that one point
174560	181120	she was controlling me as a Goose, her controller input was moving me, so every time I tried
181120	188240	to move, I was pushing against Mercy's command, I was like who's hypnotising who you are?
188240	192640	That's not allowed, literally the reverse scrawny, that's not allowed. But it was an
192640	201040	absolutely lovely collab, I'm so happy. I also, the girls have a beautiful Uno collab
201040	206320	coming out next year, oh my god spoilers for next week's schedule, oh my god you're spoiling,
207280	214560	originally I was going to participate in the Uno, but I'm not anymore because originally
214560	219360	Shibi was, but then Shibi had a job, so Shibi couldn't do it, but then Shibi quit her job,
219360	226400	like an absolute boss, like a beast. So now she has time to do it and she's going balls to the
226400	232800	wall with streams which I'm so happy, I'm so glad for her success, special thank you to anyone who
232800	240560	has supported any of the girls, you are enabling them to level up in real life, unironically.
241600	247040	Because Shibi literally, speaking of poker, if you didn't know Balatro is about poker,
247840	253040	Shibi literally said I'm all in on Vehler, she's put all of her stonks in Vehler, so thank you to
253040	258000	anyone who is making such a risk worthwhile, whether that's clipping, whether that's interacting
258000	262720	with her posts, watching her vods because it generates money if you watch vods because there's
263120	270640	advertisements on them I think, I don't know, I'll need to check, I actually, so from the behind
270640	276240	the scenes, you can tell YouTube to place ads during a stream, but I say no no no no, I'll place
276240	280240	some YouTube, wink wink, I'll totally put ads down in the middle of a stream, I do not put ads
280240	286560	down in the middle of a stream, I don't like it. The VOD, I believe should play an ad at the start
286560	289840	and the end of the VOD, I don't know if it does it in the middle, I'll need to check that out
289840	295520	because I've been a knot in Ellie and I've not been checking. You did great with the girls,
295520	305600	oh stop it, stop it, did you do a royal flush, no, so I had to take, I was up working but I've got
305600	312960	two more ASMR collabs agreed upon, I sent away two scripts, I actually need to make an ASMR script
312960	320960	for Mercy because I came up with a really good YouTube ASMR roleplay script for Mercy that I
320960	328880	absolutely adore, so I need to work on that shortly. So originally it was going to be Elden Ring in a
328880	338880	12 hour stream but I'm like, I need to cook for these girls, I need to, I'm needing to tell them
338880	343680	there's possibility, there's a talent manager maybe coming in but I'm going to ask the girls
343680	350640	what they actually want because there's no point in getting this chicken, she's a Vtuber herself,
350640	355280	she does her own content, she has experience doing projects, that kind of thing, it's a she,
355280	364160	it's a she before anyone fucking says I'm in, they're replying to my email, you're not having
364160	370240	access to my daughters, okay. Kings Lupus, thank you for becoming a member, I appreciate it.
371440	378240	After two hours of Chucky Balattro, we are going to be doing membership ASMR and then I believe
378240	384880	that is my membership debt paid for the week, yarg. Originally next week I was going to watch the
384880	392640	Barbie movie, I might switch it out for something else and I need to decide on what series we're
392640	398640	watching during RuneScape which I'll be curious, I do have a cup of tea, can you hear my little
398640	407360	thingies against it? It might be good to delay the ER to let people enjoy the DLC first but you've
407360	411520	got 24 hours to enjoy because I'm doing endurance tomorrow so as the girls are on their own for the
411520	416320	next like week, I'm playing with my refunds in that opening shot case, I'm playing with my
416320	419520	refunds for a week straight, we're doing an endurance a week straight, we're joining my
419520	426080	games and you're all holding my hand, okay. I don't want to hear about anything from the girls,
426080	434720	sorry, yous are on your own, go speak to management, that isn't me okay, go speak to someone else
434720	441200	because I ain't me, I ain't me, I can't, that book is closed, I ain't talking to yous, I'm no interested.
443360	448080	Literally, oh you've got plans, don't care, don't care, not opening your DM, if I don't see it,
448080	457360	it's not a problem, kidding, I love you girls but it's been a long time coming that I could
457360	465840	play with my refunds again okay, so you're gonna have to, you're gonna have to give me some time
465840	473040	because the refunds have waited a very long time for me and it's been bloody nice being back so
474000	480080	do forgive me girls if any of you are lurking, I need my replin, my replin, my replin, please
480080	487280	don't die, you know like if it was like a little Sims 2 bar instead of environment because, or maybe
487280	492480	instead of hygiene actually, I've not had to shower in a couple of days, normally I shower at least
492480	499520	like every other day but recently, you know my little refill and bar is low and after endurance,
499760	507520	how you call it, endurance, Elden Ring, I will, I'll be good to go, okay, so right, I'm going to
507520	520640	drip drip drip, my honey tea, I have my script writing, my membership script writing stream
521600	528560	is coming up, I ask permission for the girls if they're comfortable with me writing stuff
529360	537520	live for them and I got a few thumbs up, I've got a few requests not to do everything which I said
537520	543040	no that's not, the reality isn't going to be like I'll do it all at once but that script writing
543040	552320	screen stream is most likely going to be roughly two hours, there'll be a bootstrip script, sorry
552320	560080	there'll be a boot script, there'll possibly be two ASMR collabs with other VTubers,
561360	566320	I actually need to write my one-on-one collab with the VLR girls because I've not actually done
566320	574160	that part yet, like I need to do my like, I want to do like, so for Emi, I want to do big sister
574160	580960	and little sister tease you with Tingles ASMR, I think that would be adorable, AC,
583520	589440	I wanted to do like, I actually want to see AC in a school uniform, that sounds really weird,
589440	596160	I'm sorry I said that out loud, that was an insane thought, I wanted to like AC to be like a weird,
596160	605280	not bully but maybe like some sort of like high school roleplay with me and AC together,
605920	611440	maybe like one of those like after school clubs and we were forced to come together to do it and
611440	617120	then like, AC grabs your phone and she notices that you watch ASMR and then like, well and we're
617120	622160	all just kind of like, well we either do nothing for an hour or we could just muck around and do
622160	637360	ASMR on each other, you want Gairu AC? Gairu? Yeah, Shibi, Shibi is my other half, I wouldn't,
637920	640800	what would I want to do with her if she's my other half?
641680	654640	What would we do? Maybe a blindfold type of roleplay would fit Shibi very well,
655200	661280	if you didn't know, I try and do the theme of the person I'm collabing with, I've actually
661280	667840	got a really good few themes, I did win with them, not to ruin it, I don't think she actually
668080	674400	streams at this time so she's not even gonna be awake, I did a hexa collab and at the end of it
674400	679040	we hypnotise you to mind break you and to only watching us and I thought that was really cute
680960	684960	but before you like, do you have to put a disclaimer, it's not it's not real like actual
684960	689200	induction or anything like that so I don't think there's going to be necessarily any induction
689200	694720	needed at all for it, sorry any disclaimer needed at all for it, also can we get one minute
694720	700320	silence for the cheek clap ASMR video, oh that's my best fucking audio, oh actually that's another
700320	709360	thing, I am editing my third audio that goes up like the day, I need to edit it after the ASMR
709360	713280	history, I've got like a lot of things I need to catch up on, I need to like send stuff to editors
713280	717440	and I need to do my own stuff and I need to do this and do that and look we're getting there,
717440	724400	we're getting there, per mimosa, per mimosa for one, she was the first person that accepted a
724400	730080	ASMR collab with me and sent me her lines and she must fucking look on her subscription list and be
730080	735520	like ah she's streaming for 12 hours again, yeah that sounds about right, per mimosa she has been
735520	741680	waiting patiently, I am going to try and finish everyone's that is on standby, today that is my
741680	755760	job, let me let me finish more of my tea, for Azura, I think double heartbeat would go crazy with me
755760	766240	and Azura and a kind of sleep aid rest between us type of audio, I think that would go incredibly
766320	773280	hard with Azura just from how naturally soothing her voice is, I would absolutely love to do something
773280	778160	like that and we kind of like do tingles as you, the listener fall asleep, maybe you're feeling a
778160	783040	bit rough and you're just eating some extra TLC, I think that would be good with Azura,
783600	802560	so me and Mercy are actually kind, we're not quite the same side of the coin with each other
803440	812400	so I want to hypnotize to Mind Break, she wants to break you in because you're resistant to her
812400	822320	so we've got a bit of a similarity, a bit of a lurking theme, I'm wondering if I could get
822320	830080	Mercy into a hypno, maybe Mercy comes to me because she needs help to hypnotize Senpai
831760	836320	because you're being extra resistant because resistant, if you didn't know resistant hypnosis
836400	842880	is actually quite big where it's like me the person speaking like acknowledges that you're
842880	850160	resistant so well but then you use phrases such as sooner or later you're going to break like
850160	855600	resistant, there's no point in resisting like this kind of stuff, any chance for ace marvin
856320	869920	yes please um yes those are my one-on-one collabs I actually used to do with girls,
869920	876720	Emmer's is about to go on holiday so I'm not gonna ask for that until she's over the hedge,
877680	878720	do you remember that movie?
881360	888240	Strony is a Bork confirmed, oh my god the Bork scared me so much but then they introduced Seven
888240	894240	and Nine and then oh the Bork turned the Bork turned me on so much, I love Seven of Nine
897440	904160	she my favorite, Penpal's about to suffer, Strony you using, well there's a bit of a
904880	910320	no, Strony uses a refland to demonstrate how to mind break someone so Mercy can, oh
911520	916880	see Mercy wouldn't necessarily, um actually no that's really good, fuck you I'm stealing that
918240	924560	I am literally copying paste in that and putting it in my little notes this gorge
924960	934880	this is for uh what's your name, Mercy Collab, Emi Collab is big, it is wee sister, oh sorry
934880	938800	little sister you can't, I don't think I could put wee sister because everyone would be like is she
938800	949440	passing, Emi Collab is little sister and big sister tingle you mercilessly, I see I want some
949520	956240	sort of like feral bratty, oh bratty school girl that makes much more sense bratty school, no it
956240	963440	doesn't make sense because it's supposed to be after school class, after school club goes wrong
964160	976480	and goes tingley, goes ASMR, sexual, it doesn't but you know what I mean, um Azura double heartbeat
977120	984880	sleep aid tingle layers reassurance for bad day nice and simple and then sheepsters
986320	992560	who goes there blindfolded um blindfolded tingle experience with
994240	998160	30 different tingles how about that 30 different tingles a little cheeky challenge
1000640	1006160	okay that is now in my notes discord so I can hold myself accountable to such dastardly acts
1006320	1012560	the girls are comfortable if I write certain scripts on stream and we can certainly do explore
1012560	1019680	those kind of things so you can quite literally get me and my VTuber companion to say what you
1019680	1023520	want to hear so don't be don't be afraid to um
1027120	1033520	mm-hmm right bilateral I don't know who the game dev is

1061680	1066240	select the small blind to start the round okay thank you Jimbo
1067200	1071840	oh you earned chips by playing poker hands
1073440	1077440	each poker hand earns a base amount of chips multiplied by some multi
1079200	1085040	see your poker hands in the run info area along with other info what about your current turn
1086400	1091680	run info straight flush oh my god actually tells you how to play
1092080	1100400	what the fuck is a high card right straight flush um I understand a straight flush four of a
1100400	1109520	kind full house is three and two yeah flush is flush is five cards that share the same suit
1109520	1115520	I'm gonna have to keep that in mind you know that straight straight five cards in a row consecutive
1115520	1123120	ranks but not the same three of a kind yes with two other unscorable cards that's fine
1123120	1128080	two pairs that's possible and you can throw away the fifth oh so you have to play five a pair
1128080	1135120	just simply throw away three but what the heck is if the plate hand is not any of the above hands
1136320	1142560	only the highest ranked card scores wow okay okay I'm not
1146240	1152720	okay cards also earn you some chips hover to hover over to see
1155040	1161600	now select now select up to five cards to play and press play hand uh we've got
1163680	1169360	have we even got anything we've got a double here uh can I not do anything with these trips
1169920	1176880	they're not a triple but whatever we'll learn oh shit I've just wasted them okay we're learning
1176880	1184000	relax I'm learning okay let's try that again you can also discard up to five selected cards
1184000	1190640	to try and make it an even stronger hand try it all right that's a double there eight seven six five
1190720	1195280	so what we need I don't know the two yous can go I guess
1197440	1201280	hey carefully you only have limited numbers of hands and discards per round
1202160	1209600	earn 300 chips before you run out of hands good luck okay right uh eight seven six five oh piss
1210320	1216240	I thought we had it uh we're doing all right we've got two pairs and then we'll throw away the three

1239360	1252480	oh oh oh jeez I'm almost gonna lose we have five discards
1255920	1260400	um honestly I'm tempted to throw like all of these away
1264080	1269280	and go for the oh what does this mean doubles two doubles and then just throw that in there for
1269280	1274720	the hell of it why no two doubles they should okay that's perfectly fine more than adequate more
1274720	1283680	than adequate that was a good throw away there we go we did it 300 I know it was very terrible

2023920	2033360	you mean minus oh but it reduces every round oh sugar okay i understand a bit more we got cash
2033360	2039520	we got six dollars i hear the cogs turning very slowly this joker gains when any booster pack
2039680	2042720	skipped like these
2045760	2049200	two plus chips for every remaining card in the deck
2051200	2058320	chips what's the check that two plus chips for every remaining card in the deck
2059280	2070320	a hundred chips extra that seems tiny chips are blue the blue area yeah oh this is this good then
2074240	2080240	multi is the red number wait that looks good then yeah that does look good hold on get that bad boy
2080240	2086560	in there right i i need to do this in order or something so apply four multiplier to everyone
2087280	2095680	and then add the blue so cute hearing you say oh sugar oh sugar i'm trying not to throw too much
2095680	2099760	because i feel like i do it like every sentence and i'm like hmm shouldn't be doing that thank you
2099760	2111760	broly legend for the tips actually wait this becomes useless it's gonna become useless so
2111760	2118320	uh this joker gains a multiplier when you skip booster packs and these are booster packs
2119680	2123360	uh i'm not really interested in tarot card choose to
2124240	2129040	spectral cards oh i don't even have enough is spectral cards my planetarium ones
2131840	2136080	right okay we can't do anything more this joker gains when you skip booster pack
2136080	2146800	hmm let me learn from my mistakes okay this is my first run choose your next uh bind up the ante
2146800	2160720	raises all blinds refreshes blinds all diamond cards are debuffed so i can't i don't get anything
2160720	2169600	out of using them okay that's bad and not fun i have five discards
2172640	2175920	wow i'm a bit perplexed on what i'm supposed to do
2177600	2184000	diamond card fans see them diamond don't give points but it still holds their value
2184000	2185600	like if i played two pairs
2188480	2194160	40 times three and then what time 40 times seven
2202640	2208160	i don't know the two tens would be more valuable would they it's still 40 times
2209200	2213760	but the multiplier wouldn't apply scores no chips and all abilities are disabled on it so
2213840	2215680	i should do double sevens with a queen
2218400	2221680	i need to learn from my mistakes so i'm sorry if this is bad
2222400	2226800	i need to learn from my mistakes so debuff doesn't apply but the two sevens do apply
2227440	2236240	700 a thousand okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay double we did level up pairs
2236240	2241120	so i'm quite happy to just keep doing shout out to all my pairs god that's an old name

2811760	2821760	oh that doesn't really seem like the best idea discard okay discard take get rid of that and get
2821760	2828640	rid of the nine and maybe we can either go high well okay okay okay okay all right let him get up let
2828640	2836160	him get up we've got an ace and two pairs level three that looks that looks good and then we'll

2914960	2919520	a joker for four bucks actually doesn't seem like a bad idea
2921760	2925680	a joker for two bucks doesn't seem for four bucks apologies
2926400	2932880	10 if the hand contains a flush the joker gains three chips per discarded club card that's so
2933760	2934320	specific
2939600	2943040	10 plus multiplier is big though
2946720	2955120	it's big but that if i discard a random club it'll give me three plus on the chip side
2955920	2956400	i mean
2959360	2964960	but that's 10 plus multiplier i pick the 10 okay thank you thank you you have influenced me right

3526080	3531200	belt row goes hard it's too late for this game but generally your top row other than score in
3531200	3536400	the minimum points you need is a $25 for max interest your economy is super important in this
3536400	3543680	game ah you mean any hold on to my my money's and not spend at all but but i'm a woman that's
3543680	3551760	what we're supposed to do you tend to miss flushes straight would be better wait what you
3551760	3558880	tend i miss flushes so straight would be better right i trust you i trust you okay so i need to
3558880	3566640	hold money on my persons okay i will keep that in mind oh look it's the thing that's in Amy's
3566640	3571520	bedroom i remember when the bedroom creator came back with that and i was like what the
3571520	3577280	fuck is on the back of the room but uh it's like an actual thing next base edition shop
3577280	3588160	joker is free and becomes negative negative is one joker slot but that means i'm allowed
3588160	3591120	a six card is that no good
3594560	3601680	that's so powerful yeah the devil is actually ah yeah yeah uh it's like i already knew you were
3601680	3607440	going to say it like i said i'm on jokes your pair joker is negative
3607840	3609840	oh
3616800	3620320	does it mean like very very good if you're strong enough to skip
3621520	3627520	you already have a six joker slot oh i do and then this will give me a seventh
3628960	3636560	as long as the card is a negative but also for each okay fuck it we ball this is literally a
3636560	3643760	gamble game was gamble cards drawn face down after each hand is bro where's my hangman
3644720	3650560	does that mean what i think it means the cards are going to flip over on me so i'm getting a
3650560	3657760	piece of paper right now i'm not i'm not going in this blind okay the fish more like the fish
3657760	3661600	don't ever give me this mission again right okay
3664640	3667760	i see fuck all
3674320	3681680	okay i'm gonna have to ditch so we have an ace oh no pencil oh pencil please work with me

3690160	3697440	all you guys i know i do have a pair they're buying that leveled up we have an ace we have a 10
3698000	3705360	we have an eight and a seven surely this is gonna go well the new cards are drawn face down
3705360	3714800	i'll be shooting blind shut no way that's not even possible wait i can play this do i want to play it
3717280	3718400	i think you're fucked

3743120	3753200	two what is this hand look this is the worst i just want riddities honestly these are so weak
3757520	3760800	i think i want to go high and just get rid of all the low you know that
3761360	3764160	keep the sevens sevens are good
3769600	3774320	you can play less than you can play less than the five if i want to
3776400	3782320	you can dig for a flush i that's something throw the threes the five and twos but keep the sevens
3782480	3787360	okay it's not gonna be much of a shuffle that's my only
3789600	3792720	are you fucking fishing me i think i'm gonna have to play a double
3796720	3801120	i think i'm gonna have to do it so i've got an ace i've got a jack i've got a 10 i've got an eight
3801120	3806560	and i've got six yeah i think this is what i'm gonna throw away the six just because i don't want low

3814800	3824960	face in your face uh yegachad you've got lots of discards left i know but i get nervous i'm not

3848160	3849360	oh puss that was
3858480	3858800	hello
3862880	3864320	is this probability
3865280	3872640	hah wouldn't it be oh i can't even get a royal flush that's not how it works
3877280	3884800	um it's sorted by rank okay so we know these are lower than eight and these are higher than
3884800	3892480	that use the sort button that's already at rank you can sort by suit
3895200	3896400	oh no
3900480	3904000	wait so that can give me a three suit no but you can't do that
3904960	3909760	oh man now it's a puzzle game bruv bruv
3914560	3919280	that was doing so well on this run but i don't think we're gonna make it you can discard the
3919280	3927600	face down cards wait they'll come back the cards will come back viewable i don't want to get rid
3927680	3931760	of these because they seem high discard all the face done
3938080	3938400	okay
3943520	3952560	it's very likely this is a king right if it's not we've got a double joker
3952720	3958160	is that how probability works
3960320	3966240	male's camera thank you for coming to member i appreciate it this come on
3967600	3975280	unbless we just played mega safe and do two ace and two pair that'll give me what 5k again

3982560	3988800	no gamba all right gamba right what did i do ace king queen
3990880	3997040	oh that's not what i did at all right i can put down that card because i know for a fact either
3997040	4002160	way i've covered the thing so this has to be a king surely this is a king
4002320	4015200	oh we did it we did it gamba paid off we did it probability oh wait we only got 4k for that
4015200	4016560	that was so big though
4020880	4022160	that was so big
4022160	4035840	um i don't know if we're winning this one i think wait hold on rank if i do it by rank
4035840	4043040	these are all high again so the probability of a double riko thank you for the five gifted
4043040	4050080	memberships congrats to those who caught it with your face in your face that's totally not the
4050080	4055680	blue joker is coughing up blood at the moment is it this one

4066400	4073520	riko and boy for all the gifted memberships right if i do it by rank these two are whoa
4073760	4081360	what if you want to like number them out the wazoo oh then you can about this
4084720	4094960	uh i don't i'm not even looking right 10 and ace there's no way the odds are the game
4094960	4098560	the odds are the game actually can't give me another
4099520	4103520	flush
4108720	4116080	um can it give me a flush do we just gamble again but we're not making enough we're only
4116080	4118720	getting 5k per round i've got two more hands
4121760	4128160	oh math jumpscare honestly uh you know what we're playing a gamba game it's very unlikely
4128160	4132560	we're going to win this round so you we might as well go all in
4138560	4138960	how
4141920	4148880	how i'm not lucky like this i mean we're not going to make it because we don't have
4149360	4153280	um
4155840	4160640	math jumpscare this is impossible i think i'm just gonna have to discard
4161920	4168400	i don't want to discard the high though if i discard oh i don't want to discard the high
4169280	4174080	this is most likely a double nine here so these are useless but i don't want to take them out of
4174080	4183520	my deck clearly there's another straight there can there be there can't be oh
4183520	4192240	fuck it did we just do this and see if we get any like thingies i don't think we can win we're
4192240	4199200	we're so blind discard everything and pray yolo yolo i think just send it what we got
4200000	4207600	oh we could add a triple nine oh no i don't have enough good jokers for unfortunately
4207600	4213200	that was a good run though for that was a good run best hand that was so good
4214560	4223120	oh no were you bluffing too sometimes that is so good defeated by the fish yeah definitely
4223120	4232560	not wanting to go against the fish again that was rough right new run blue deck unlocked discover
4232560	4239680	at least 20 items from your collection one plus hand every round joker unlocked defeat a boss
4239680	4250960	blind in one hand without using any discards um i'm not sure i'm that good reach anti level
4251360	4259680	joker turret planet and spectral cards may appear multiple times um i had pretty bad luck with
4259680	4272800	jokers okay okay uh what what is this i'll just do basic red deck i don't oh seeded run i thought
4272800	4276720	this had speed run i was like steady on it i don't think i can do it speed thank you for making it
4276800	4282800	hard for me to work smile i didn't say anything bad i've never even said anything bad this stream
4282800	4287520	thank you really legend for the tip i've never even said anything bad this stream i've been good
4288800	4294480	doubles your money like that you can hold right i definitely need to hold on to my money a bit
4294480	4304080	better so gender norms you need a back off right now ace jack ten nine what two pairs i feel like
4304080	4309680	because it's like just the start we can kind of you know piss arse about i think
4311840	4316400	yeah we've got like three rounds we can we can play low games okay we can play
4316400	4326080	low games like low rounds it's not it is not um bad right nine ten jack i wouldn't mind getting a king
4326640	4329440	gonna be honest if we get a king
4332400	4336800	unless we get an eight then it would be a lower flush but
4338880	4342240	fuck it give me a hand uh uh
4345280	4352480	i'm not gonna have to play pairs shut up to all my pairs but the main thing was no economy yeah
4353440	4356480	you want to try and win in one hand because each time gives you an extra oh
4357840	4363840	keep an eight in case of an eight yeah i totally kept the eight what you're talking about what do
4363840	4369920	you mean you didn't see it it just walked away i know i should probably go for a king but
4373520	4378560	you know what it's the first round i think we win by default just because of how low the the
4378640	4385920	blind is it's so low like it's we can't really lose this famous last words famous last words we
4385920	4392800	can't lose this uh wait wait can i just keep playing pairs or am i actually gonna lose in the first
4392800	4397600	round please don't that's that's actually embarrassing please don't actually make me lose in the first
4397600	4408560	round okay it's fine it's fine we're here we're here um well just get rid of all these then
4410160	4415440	it's fine it's fine yeah there's see look we got a little triple oh we got a little full house
4415440	4422160	moment please see it's fine no no i i don't think i can lose on this the very first level i think
4422160	4428480	it's hard to lose there's three good weeks high straight high flush medium full house
4430720	4434960	yeah you guys are kind of i'm gonna lie reeflings i didn't realize your past time
4435520	4440720	was gambling gambling's quite bad didn't didn't you know gamble bad
4440960	4448080	see that hand size helps i don't want it
4451120	4453200	i'm gonna go and keep my economy
4454160	4457040	skip playing double your money no that's not useless for me
4459040	4464800	then save your money save your money i may quickly make a cup of tea after we lose this one
4464800	4469840	because there's no way i'm gonna be smart enough to actually win i refuse to believe
4471520	4473440	i refuse right what we got
4479520	4485280	after losing many hours to this game i found sticking to one type of hand and destroying cars
4485280	4489920	so don't match it with the devil arcana or other means it's a good way to help build a
4489920	4496640	consistent strategy for collector jokers are jokers locked for me thank you jobon
4496640	4504560	brian we love betting on mortgage no stroney i'll catch up later glad you liked my idea for the
4504560	4510240	mercy collab earlier go conquer big no we're not conquering big gang but thank you job
4511200	4518560	no go job no go job no go that sounds like an ace of martyr job
4520720	4527520	thank you for the 20 um yes thank you for your patience for watching me play this for the first
4527520	4532480	time i did watch another streamer play it for like two hours and i was like yeah yeah i can play
4532480	4537920	this game on stream mihu as soon as i hit go live completely forget all of the terminology
4538000	4540640	because you guys are like yeah flush are straight and all that and i'm like
4542640	4548880	i remember i remember that a phil house is going to do a three and a double four of a kind is well
4548880	4557360	four of a kind straight flush i need to get straight and flush flush is all the same but
4557360	4562880	straight flush is all the same in the same suit okay i just need to get my head right about flush
4562880	4569520	and straight flush the toilet because it's all the same color that's how i'm going to remember it
4569520	4573840	no i don't care if that's disgusting flush the toilet because it's all the same color
4575040	4580560	and straight numbers okay that's how i'll remember it when you guys are talking
4583680	4588720	that's how i'm going to remember it this is where i make my stand oh no keep the eight
4588720	4590480	people say keep the eight so i'll keep the eight
4593760	4599040	we've got a duplicate right we'll play the double oh wait i don't have a joker in place i may actually
4599040	4608240	lose this what so i just bend these i'll just bend these ones okay it's fine oh that's what i
4608240	4616640	wanted to see right what can we do we can do ten jack king queen ace let's go
4620160	4625520	flush like my whole face flushes with red when i see you okay that's probably a nicer way to see it
4625520	4631200	than a flush the toilet because it's all the same color half that man that's probably a nicer way to
4631200	4643120	put it uh wait again more on core on core on core straight on core it feels good man
4645200	4652080	okay i'll take it hopefully we can get a joker for multipliers in the shop because the the joker
4652080	4661360	cards are kind of definitely maker break the jokers are maker break one and two no don't care
4662240	4668240	um this joker gains three multi with any booster pack that skipped
4672000	4677760	i mean i skip booster packs or is this a booster pack even oh i guess that's a booster pack so it
4677760	4685040	doesn't count okay we'll just do celestia molest sorry um my brain just wanted to run
4687040	4695040	right a straight flush is when it's on in the same suit which is so rare three of a kind
4695040	4702240	isn't that rare four of a kind i think three of a kind oh wait but am i actually gonna do three of
4702240	4707520	a kind normally if i've got three of a kind i'm able to do a full house
4710480	4715680	intrusive thoughts are coming out i can't believe it hi stroney belcher is my favorite game hope you
4715680	4722080	like it i am so sorry for the gameplay you're about to witness i can only apologize it's my four of a
4722080	4728320	kind is also super hard three is more realistic yeah i um i'm biased towards venus because it's so
4728320	4734640	unlike straight flush is so unlikely and four of a kind i i don't think i've actually played one
4734640	4740960	four of a kind yet um so we'll just upgrade the most likely we've still got ten dollars in hand
4740960	4746880	so surely that means my economy is good right right all heart cards are debuffed i don't think
4746880	4753680	we're gonna do this we don't have a joker on the playing field yet we don't have one joker oh there's
4753760	4759040	our triple oh baby a triple we're gonna throw away these and play three of a kind

4773120	4779120	let's go that's how it works right we already did it okay we didn't even need a joker but i do
4779120	4786880	want a joker i do okay i really would like a joker please okay that was good that was good
4787680	4791760	spectral cards can shape your deck to increase the likelihood of four of a kind oh i don't know you
4791760	4799040	could do that uh the cards are in my favor and before i have a really good lucky seed then i
4799040	4807120	mess it up i went nine for that one two dollars interest for every five dollars in my thingy i
4807120	4814880	get an extra dollar that's good don't feel bad enjoy watching you learn this is a game where it gets
4814880	4822400	easier the longer you play or at least you understand it better oh thank you for your patience jubo no

4852160	4859600	sense well now that i'm a vtuber i get plenty of time to play games for the first time but before i
4859600	4864720	didn't hardly have every time like to like just be late i don't want spectral packs we'll play
4864720	4871040	like i just never had time for it but now i have like all the time to like like look at these games
4871040	4875040	and be like you know what i'm actually interested in playing that game this game that game right i've
4875040	4882560	got eight now i want to throw a nine away that seems a bit harsh i'm a better throw at the
4882560	4885920	pair away but i feel like the nine's just randomly sitting there
4890640	4894160	what what do my my trusted advisors the reeflings advise
4895200	4899760	your hard work paid off by the way have you seen that one banana game that's trending on stream
4899760	4906960	no someone says keep the name the message after it chuck the nine wait what's the banana game
4906960	4913280	Danny to look it up you could also keep the clubs oh you're right
4917920	4920160	surely we will score another club
4924160	4926560	surely we will score another club
4928960	4935200	i'm gonna regret doing the club route you know that i'm gonna regret them can i just play that
4937680	4943520	it's only gonna give me what like less than a hundred if i play that
4945040	4949760	if i play the just play the two pairs okay okay okay okay we'll play the two pairs
4950960	4956400	and we will throw away the three i'm gonna try and throw away the four and whatever hand i get
4956400	4963040	next as well because it ain't whatever we tried to do any time it's no happening so might as well
4963040	4971760	try and get rid of the low so we can have a hand fuller we have a triple and we've got the freaking
4973040	4981040	buff of it i don't have a double no yeah okay and then we'll just throw away the six and the four
4982960	4989280	yeah that seems right yeah yeah i'm getting MLG right we do need a joker though i would
4989280	4997280	very much like a joker joker joker if you'd like to show up a decent joker um we do have
4997280	5006000	three discards we have a double of a we do not have any suits coming into play i think i'm happy
5006000	5010400	to just throw those away wow
5010880	5020080	wow i mean might as well just throw those away because we've got a queen to follow up right after
5020720	5024720	don't mind if i do don't mind oh wait it's a full house
5027280	5034400	wait ace is standing is anything for a full house i'm oh wait all i had to do is play double queen
5034400	5040800	i'm sorry i'm but we did it we won i'm so sorry i apologize wow we got three extra dollars because
5040800	5047520	of how much money on my hand i'm sorry but we did it anyway that's the main thing oh my gosh
5051680	5056720	oh my god the game is tempting me so hard right now i'm so i'm so tempted to go out
5057680	5063280	the inner inner women was it do they call it retail therapy the retail therapy is going
5063280	5068640	hard right now please please let me cannot buy them all please please reeflings let me buy all the
5068640	5075200	four of them please for me i've been such a good streamer i've been streaming everything
5078800	5082560	no don't say no to me say please i said please
5083840	5089280	very concentrate on a specific hand are you serious oh come on let me go for it it's retail
5089360	5094480	therapy right i'm going for it i've been a good girl sorry but most removed like oh i need to
5094480	5098960	break streaming so stressful uh no i need to play more with the reeflings they need to hold my hand
5098960	5109440	through games fuck off move aside i need to keep streaming okay so let's still pack right full house
5109440	5118720	high card i never play high card three of a kind or full house full house if we invest in earth
5119360	5123760	then full house offers more than what a base three of a kind can offer anyway because you're
5123760	5127280	getting extra two thingies in it
5132720	5135280	a fucking earth card desune
5140800	5146080	oh no i've only got nine so i'm only gonna get one dollar the fact i don't even have a joker yet
5146080	5155360	is shocking create up to two jokers must have room create but does it mean use the two jokers
5156000	5163120	i might have to do that if it means it gives me two jokers i think we might have to
5163120	5166640	do
5166640	5170800	yeah skip skip okay right give us these jokers because we need it
5170800	5173760	whoa one of them's turned off are you okay
5176880	5184000	oh person 20 multiplier if the hand contains uh three of a kind okay
5184960	5194800	50 chips if the plate is a pair yeah we needed something of this nature so maybe we'll go for
5194800	5204880	trip check on boys um triple triple triple we've got a duble of a but it's two i don't want such a
5204880	5211360	low duble of a it might not be obvious but you can sell jokers if you don't want them and i'll
5211440	5216320	sell them once we get like better things to replace them with not three of a kind
5216320	5222000	only if you play three cards or less wouldn't that be three of a kind then i'm so sorry
5224480	5231920	contains a pair a pair contains three of a kind it's three or less cards so a pair in a single
5231920	5235920	card would also work to activate you
5240320	5248160	do i discard you can play a pair playing a pair of two with one of them debuffed is like
5248160	5256720	rough though i think i'm gonna throw all these away play the twos oh no you say play the twos
5257680	5265440	do it let's just play the twos see the power okay reef flings i'll see the power we're playing
5265440	5278720	three so that should activate we're debuffed on the two debuff right that was the weakest thing
5278720	5282240	i have ever witnessed in the game said aye that's fine
5286080	5289760	whoa so if i do this i win
5297840	5302880	whoa jokers are maker break holy crap jokers are maker break
5303600	5311600	okay and we get a little bonus dollar as well yes we did so we got eight payout that's good
5312560	5318640	oh my god the game is tempting me stop it what is this one consumable slot no i don't really mess
5318640	5329280	with that high card i never play a flush oh it takes me just under 15 it takes me just under
5329280	5334880	15 so i'll miss out the three dollar bonus but i want to i want to try the buffoon pack
5336240	5341760	choose one up to two jokers oh fuck it we ballin right let me get this one and then we'll try the
5341760	5353440	buffoon as well oh my tummy hurt am i experiencing a hunger i might be adds double the rank of the
5354400	5364560	hand to multi to do jog oil change karate eat candy ruminate earn four dollars if poker hand
5364560	5373440	is a two-payer poker hand changes at the end not sure about that one add is double the value
5374640	5381040	the left one's pretty good i am inclined to also want to pick the left one the fist okay please
5381040	5389280	fist me okay thank you i'm sorry um and we will get two dollars per every round played
5391040	5397120	and just to add double the rank on the lowest so that's a multiplier so we're going to have
5397120	5409760	the multipliers together and then the chips that side um upgrade high card by three levels
5410720	5414400	but i don't play high card i never play high card
5417280	5422000	i feel like high card is like a hail me unless wait hold on hold on
5423760	5429600	that 20 multiplier would come into play if i played an ace like an ace on its own
5431520	5438480	hold on a minute hold on a minute this might actually be worth it if i'm not mistaken
5439440	5448800	this 20 multiplier as well as high card it won't help with the pair of joker as it won't scale
5448800	5464960	very long yeah but no chips oh true right let's focus on duplicates and trips okay we'll focus on
5464960	5473440	doubles and trips thank you for your your um right we already have a double ace if i play double
5473440	5483440	ace and throw away the five with it add the double to the lowest rank held in hand to the
5483440	5489280	multiplier so it has to be a two which is fine i'll take a two uh right we'll get rid of the five
5489280	5494080	just to clear a few things up in the hand don't forget to check your run info why yes of course
5495920	5502160	so two pairs is what my strongest contender but the multiplier isn't actually that big
5502160	5510320	oh sorry my apologies four full house is my biggest earner we are starting to level up
5510320	5519520	quite nicely i'm enjoying it uh i think we'll throw away the five um
5524720	5531200	yeah sorry this multiplier comes in very strongly if i do the five option skipping around is very
5531200	5535040	impactful because not only do you lose money but you also lose your chance at seeing the shop as well
5535040	5542240	oh okay okay maybe that's why i was like hardly see any jokers um jay to the torn card do you have
5542240	5550160	a kind as your hail mary full of grace someone sent me um something on marsh mallow and it's like
5550160	5561440	hail strongy my comments with you what how we've already won that was just one goal and we get an
5561440	5568800	extra two dollars and remaining we got eight for that that's fantastic oh no i'm getting four of a
5568800	5577840	kind i'd never get a chance to play four of a kind though what are you play aces give 20 oh wow
5580960	5584080	four multiplier as well as 20 chips
5584640	5594320	oh i'd buy the spectral pack and nothing else are you spectral pack player i'm only celestial
5595040	5599840	him in the planet booster still leaves you at 10 so i would still get double
5601360	5606880	you're right i'm going to do celestial pack and joker this joker if he comes in correctly
5607440	5612800	so that's a multiplier so i want it to be in front of this guy
5616880	5619040	and then that's a little thing on top
5620960	5624560	wow okay okay let's let's see what we've got in here
5627680	5635280	we have a high card i don't play a straight flush i don't and a straight straight definitely straight
5635920	5641520	but a straight flush is next to impossible odds i'll take a straight though
5645040	5648400	right let's do it let's see what we're up against
5649440	5656640	3000 or gives a mega arcane pack which i am not fussed for personally three aces is the ultimate
5656640	5662160	hand for you now speaking of aces i got nothing
5666480	5671600	double nine audit is it like is it valuable enough or just throw all these away
5673840	5675920	would double nine be valuable enough
5677600	5682720	pair yeah i'm like honestly and then i'll throw away the two just so it's not in the way
5683680	5689440	let's see what let's see let's see what happens if i do just double nine what kind of monies do we get
5691280	5702160	okay why it's so big so if i get to play an ace it also a double ace well we'll do double 10 and
5702160	5703840	then that's what's done already
5707360	5710240	we have made pairs so OP honestly
5712160	5716080	literally have made pairs so OP we don't even have to do anything
5717600	5719040	oh this is so good
5722400	5727520	oh we got extra four bucks as well four and then remaining hands
5728480	5736320	ah yes okay so that so if i'd managed to do it in one i get three max dollars and if i keep a lot more money on me i get more
5736320	5745120	okay okay okay okay i'm getting tempted though joker tarot planet and spectral cards can appear multiple times
5745120	5748160	don't care one in four chance for a holographic
5751040	5751920	but it can fail
5757600	5765120	if it fails i waste three bucks but i'll still be but i'll make it back naturally complete in the round
5765120	5773120	so is it really gambling is it really gamble if i don't actually lose out on the money in the next round
5776000	5782480	the wheel mathematically never go for the wheel but technically i make it back by default so it's not
5782480	5786480	really gambling it's not really gambling
5789920	5792320	whoa it put on the best one
5794320	5800240	it put on the best one streamer lock streamer lock streamer lock identified
5801760	5806480	play only one hat okay i can throw a ton of stuff away though
5807280	5810640	wait i make 2000 with a low pair anyway
5814000	5820800	okay let's throw all this i saw away i just need an ace that's it move one
5823360	5831040	move one that's it that's all we had to do even though the game said play one hand
5832000	5834800	easy peasy leaven squeezy
5836800	5841120	wow 6000 for double aces
5842400	5842800	wow
5845440	5851280	oh my goodness we got five bucks for that and we got our three bucks back so our gamble heck and
5851280	5860480	paid off on that we're now in the 23 what's this v-roll boss blind one time but it's cost
5860480	5868880	to do it right what are you hundred chips if played hand contains a three of a kind
5871680	5877200	that's actually not bad for our build but we are going for pair a pair yeah we are going for
5877200	5890880	a pair should have upgraded the pairs i don't really go for flushes maybe there's a pair in here
5890880	5898800	gamble for the pair what's in here let me see a pair so i want to level up pair now don't i
5899200	5904800	buy or three of a kind pair or three of a kind
5909440	5918960	pair or three of a kind pairs i know the pairs are just so op you want all the mercuries got it
5918960	5925440	loud and clear loud and clear mercuries are the way it go right right right right what are you a
5925440	5935680	flush i don't even need you anymore do i know now this one does have my interest because there may
5935680	5950800	be situations where a triple will come up i'm tempted i'm tempted arcane for easy win choose
5951360	5955440	choose one of the three tarot cards to be used might as well seems good right okay
5955440	5962320	that's our five jokers which i'm happy with so if it's a pair i get 50 if it's three of a kind i
5962320	5967120	get 100 so these actually conflict a little bit maybe that wasn't the wisest idea
5973840	5977680	oh dear maybe i shouldn't have done that you know what you live in your learn let's go next
5977680	5987520	you live in your learn 5000 create creates two jokers to choose from though oh that's juicy
5990240	5995600	uh three of a kind gives you 150 because both of the jokers apply oh wait i don't want new jokers then
5998640	6003840	uh you don't have room yes i would have to sell so let's not do that let's not skip around
6003840	6010080	we'll also get three bonus for how much we won we won already did we win already
6017440	6024160	play did we get 5000 just we do because we got 6000 last time
6024240	6035680	seven thousand when we won first hand okay okay i like this game this is getting
6035680	6043280	ye this is getting jesse look we got an extra six dollars bonus i was gonna skip that as well
6043280	6050320	thank goodness i didn't choose one of the playing cards to add to your dick re-triggers all the cards
6050320	6061840	i don't really quite comprehend at random he can apply a multi depending on what time he's putting
6069280	6076240	re-triggers good with your joker whenever the fire rises you know i feel like i would have
6076240	6086320	to sell that one though for him yes that makes sense to sell him in order of a higher molly
6088880	6096400	yeah okay get rid of him add you you crazy card you i'll pop you right there because
6096400	6101840	these are both chips and these are mullies oh wait does he need to go in front of him
6101840	6110800	because he does chips as well right what is a jumbo saleth pack i am very happy to see you
6110800	6117840	whatever you are it just means there's a lot in it mercury um i'm going for you i'm all in on mercury
6118720	6120480	yep all for you baby
6120720	6133280	oh i doubled it up twice that's fantastic okay order doesn't matter with these particular
6133280	6141600	jokers okay the blank gives a dollar pair unused discard this run will give 29 bucks
6142160	6145600	i get 29 dollars with a skip this
6149440	6156400	take the 29 and run that's worth it okay don't have to tell oh wait but i don't have a shop
6157920	6168720	but that's okay because cards played previously this ante are debuffed so just do aces once
6172560	6174480	ah wait no
6177440	6189600	my aces don't count what do i do uh it's just two aces that are due discard for pairs right
6189600	6191920	i'll go for high pairs i know that's one there but
6196400	6197360	discard again
6198160	6206080	discard and triangle for higher pairs up here that seems like the smartest thing i can do
6208240	6208800	yeah that
6211920	6213600	i want another ace to appear
6215680	6220640	not me being able to do a royal flush oh sorry that's a straight my apologies
6220960	6230320	do i get actually you know what get rid of this ace that doesn't work and then when the double ace
6230320	6237760	comes through that'll be better so this isn't a lose lose this is still a good move it gets rid
6237760	6242400	of all these cards and it gives me a higher chance to roll an ace that isn't affected no
6242560	6253360	no wait no yep discard the other ace just discard the ace and use a regular ace
6256640	6259840	just keep the ace level three straight is good though yeah
6263040	6264800	better to discard the two
6265680	6274480	oh i'm conflicted on what to do i guess straight doesn't work with your jokers though but i do have
6274480	6281840	that no there's straight is good oh fuck it sorry i don't know if i'm gonna mess this up i don't
6281840	6286320	know if i should get rid of this ace and then in hopes for an ace that isn't debuffed though
6287680	6289760	straight doesn't work with any of my jokers though
6290480	6291040	mm-hmm
6292800	6298720	mate i'm gonna do this to clear my hand i have three more yeah i do have three more turns i'm
6298720	6308480	doing this to clear the hand on purpose okay on purpose i am clearing the hand i got five thousand
6308480	6314000	that was decent if i can just get there see boom what do i get if i do double ace
6314000	6323360	uh-huh let them numbers keep going up baby uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
6325760	6330480	wow okay it worked it worked it worked it worked it worked it worked and you got any
6330480	6338800	doubt or wait so if i have 45 in my pocket how much bonus that yet oh max of five which is 25
6338800	6349920	dollars still low um planet cards appear two times more frequently yes i want to upgrade this shiz
6349920	6358400	out of my uh planet cards so yes i will take you what i do with you planet merchant redeemed yes
6358400	6365920	what a okay i don't put it anymore try a death card select two cards convert the left into the

6724560	6729840	and turn kings into aces as well stop i'm gonna cream is that real
6730800	6741120	that re-roll could upgrade kings to aces okay i am learning i am tempted to re-roll honestly
6741120	6749840	if we if going below 25 doesn't count then okay plow no i don't play high cards that was rubbish
6751040	6755760	the joker gains three trips pair discarded diet that nah right okay that was always the money

6842880	6848320	i actually don't know how the game like what the end in game is is that the ante is eight i think
6849440	6855920	eleven dollars feels good man what we got all cards are considered face cards what does that
6855920	6864880	even mean can dig for kings with the fish she's getting addicted me addicted you have to be eight
6864880	6869520	boss fights beating ante eight is the end so we're already halfway through
6869520	6875360	should be able to uh with when all the kings become aces you can one shot give me mercury
6875360	6877360	mercury mercury shit
6881120	6884960	maybe i'll just put it on saturn then and then a straight would be a hill mary

6921600	6929920	level up my king as long as i roll the fucking king right increase the rank of a card
6931120	6937920	increase the rank of up to two selected cards by one so do it on the eight as well while i'm at it

7000080	7010080	discard for pairs i don't want to discard the high though because they could be a
7011280	7014880	are you sure discard the face up everyone saying discard for pairs
7020640	7023920	i'm worried about them being aces and like throwing that away
7024160	7031280	i don't know if i discard the lower cards right let me discard these ones
7033760	7036880	and then that pushes me to most likely have high

7350000	7357040	i'm gonna have to start spending at the shop the shop's gonna have to start giving me the goods
7357040	7363680	because that was quite a few attempts my economy is high so that's giving me the extra five every
7363680	7369280	time which is good not gonna lie it is the first girl's addicted to gamble he's the most

7383040	7389680	my hand size by one we still are only rolling for aces and we can still discard five at a time
7391360	7397200	and if the ante is less it means i don't need to get as much at the moment which is what i'm kind of
7397200	7409520	needing oh that's not hand side that's hands numbers that i can play oh no i don't like that then

15458160	15459160	How about one more time?
15459160	15460160	How about one more time?
15460160	15461160	How about one more time?
15461160	15462160	How about one more time?
15462160	15463160	How about one more time?
15463160	15464160	How about one more time?
15464160	15465160	How about one more time?
15465160	15466160	How about one more time?
15466160	15467160	How about one more time?
15467160	15468160	How about one more time?
15468160	15469160	How about one more time?
15469160	15470160	How about one more time?
15470160	15471160	How about one more time?
15471160	15472160	How about one more time?
15472160	15473160	How about one more time?
15473160	15474160	How about one more time?
15474160	15477160	Wait, eight, seven, six, five, four.
15480160	15481160	Oh, it's cool.
15484160	15486160	Ten, nine, eight, seven, eight.
15489160	15490160	I see diamonds.
15496160	15498160	Surely I'll get another diamond.
15498160	15499160	No, I won't!
15501160	15502160	Shit, I kind of want a diamond.
15504160	15505160	Um...
15514160	15516160	These are so big, but fuck it, I want a diamond.
15516160	15517160	Give me one.
15517160	15519160	Yes, one, two, three, four, five.
15519160	15520160	Lovely.
15520160	15523160	How much we getting?
15523160	15525160	We're getting two free jokers out of this as well.
15525160	15527160	Double ace, double king.
15527160	15528160	Done.
15528160	15529160	Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
15531160	15533160	I'm eating my chicken nipples.
15535160	15536160	Well, there you go.
15536160	15540160	We are a bit poor, but so is reals cost less.
15542160	15543160	Wait!
15544160	15546160	Oh, no!
15550160	15551160	Oh, no.
15551160	15554160	It overrids the other one we could have got.
15556160	15559160	I want to reset the run.
15560160	15561160	I'm going to reset.
15561160	15563160	I didn't know I did that in your run.
15563160	15564160	Yeah.
15565160	15567160	I didn't realise it did that.
15568160	15569160	Okay.
15570160	15572160	One joker slot minus a hand.
15572160	15573160	Oh, okay.
15574160	15576160	We didn't even do anything though.
15576160	15578160	We didn't even achieve anything.
15578160	15579160	Right.
15579160	15581160	If I skip this one,
15583160	15585160	and then go into this one.
15585160	15586160	Yes.
15586160	15587160	Jeez.
15587160	15589160	Sorry, I'm a bit slow.
15589160	15590160	Right.
15590160	15593160	We can actually do a wee baby straight right here.
15593160	15594160	Why not?
15601160	15602160	Oh, my God.
15602160	15603160	This is delicious.
15603160	15605160	Wait, I'll just go around.
15606160	15610160	It's very hard to lose at this stage.
15613160	15615160	I'll go with duple b.
15615160	15616160	Okay.
15618160	15621160	I think we're going to have to get rid of all this.
15622160	15623160	There we go.
15623160	15625160	That's what I'm looking for.
15625160	15627160	I can't just get rid of that.
15627160	15628160	Okay.
15628160	15630160	I'm confident in the lower rounds because I'm like,
15630160	15632160	it's hard to lose in the lower rounds
15632160	15635160	unless you have like devious luck.
15636160	15637160	Oh.
15642160	15643160	No, sorry.
15643160	15644160	The voucher is worth it.
15644160	15646160	One extra hand size.
15647160	15648160	Yeah.
15648160	15649160	Worth.
15649160	15650160	I'm keeping it.
15650160	15651160	It's mine.
15651160	15652160	Next round.
15652160	15653160	Let's go.
15654160	15655160	Oh.
15656160	15658160	The blind was actually reducing it.
15658160	15660160	So I've just made it neutral now.
15660160	15662160	Oh, my free joker.
15665160	15667160	Why am I like this?
15668160	15670160	Why was I born this way?
15671160	15675160	Why can I only retain one piece of information at a time?
15676160	15677160	Why?
15677160	15680160	The average human can retain like seven pieces of information
15680160	15681160	at any moment.
15681160	15682160	Me?
15682160	15683160	One.
15684160	15686160	That restart.
15686160	15687160	Unironically.
15687160	15688160	Right.
15688160	15689160	Fuck it.
15689160	15690160	We're restarting.
15690160	15691160	I want to win.
15691160	15692160	I want to win.
15692160	15693160	Let me reset.
15693160	15694160	Let's try it again.
15694160	15695160	Three rolls the next shot.
15695160	15696160	Yeah.
15696160	15697160	No, that's fine.
15697160	15698160	Let's go.
15699160	15701160	We need to play perfectly
15701160	15703160	or we might not as well play at all.
15703160	15705160	I'm getting rid of all that and just doing trips.
15710160	15711160	Oh, wow.
15711160	15712160	Full house.
15712160	15713160	Don't mind if I do.
15713160	15714160	Don't mind if I do.
15719160	15720160	Okay.
15720160	15721160	Good.
15721160	15722160	What are you doing?
15725160	15726160	Mm-hmm.
15726160	15727160	Mm-hmm.
15727160	15728160	Mm-hmm.
15730160	15731160	I'll take you.
15733160	15735160	That looks good to me.
15735160	15736160	That looks good to you.
15736160	15737160	Cuttlefish memory.
15737160	15738160	Goldfish memory.
15738160	15739160	Oh, I'm way worse.
15739160	15740160	Seriously.
15741160	15742160	Mm.
15744160	15747160	Something else must be your other sex.
15747160	15749160	I just think of refluence for the rest.
15749160	15750160	Right.
15750160	15751160	I'm happy with that.
15751160	15752160	I'm going to plan it up,
15752160	15754160	which will help me in later game stuff.
15755160	15756160	Redeem.
15756160	15757160	Okay, good.
15758160	15760160	Okay, I think I'm going to kick in again.
15761160	15762160	This is delicious.
15764160	15765160	Mm-hmm.
15767160	15768160	Mm-hmm.
15771160	15772160	Mm-hmm.
15774160	15777160	That won't get access to the shop until after all of this.
15778160	15780160	But it's a free joker.
15781160	15784160	Surely I won't forget about the joker.
15784160	15787160	Surely I won't forget about the joker.
15787160	15790160	All hearts are debuffed.
15790160	15791160	That's a lot of hearts.
15791160	15792160	I'm not going to lie.
15792160	15793160	If I had a king,
15793160	15795160	we actually could have done a straight flush there.
15796160	15797160	Mm-hmm.
15797160	15800160	Get rid of all of you.
15801160	15803160	I have three discards, which is fine.
15805160	15806160	Um...
15807160	15808160	Full house?
15809160	15810160	Full house.
15810160	15811160	Yes, full house.
15814160	15815160	Right.
15815160	15816160	Uh, doubles?
15817160	15818160	I'll take it.
15818160	15819160	I'll throw away this eight,
15819160	15820160	because I can't do anything with it.
15820160	15821160	Oh, I'm going to see...
15824160	15825160	Sorry.
15825160	15826160	Ugh.
15827160	15828160	Um...
15828160	15829160	We'll get rid of the two,
15829160	15831160	because it doesn't do anything for me.
15831160	15832160	But it's here.
15832160	15834160	Thank you very much, we fling.
15834160	15835160	Um...
15835160	15836160	Well, we have 400.
15836160	15838160	We've still got enough free runs.
15838160	15839160	I am...
15840160	15843160	Let's just clear this deck up a bit.
15843160	15844160	I'm not really wanting that.
15844160	15845160	Two joker.
15846160	15847160	Let's do...
15847160	15848160	Oh, two...
15848160	15849160	Oh, well.
15849160	15851160	That doesn't count, so it's not actually debuffed.
15853160	15854160	Bless you.
15854160	15855160	He's on high.
15855160	15856160	Salute.
15857160	15858160	Wait, you're still here?
15858160	15859160	Look.
15859160	15860160	I'm sorry.
15861160	15862160	I'm sorry.
15863160	15865160	We're redirecting into Ezra.
15865160	15867160	I know it was supposed to be a small stream day.
15867160	15868160	I'm addicted.
15868160	15869160	Okay, I admit it.
15869160	15870160	I have a problem.
15870160	15872160	Stage one is admitting you have a problem.
15872160	15875160	Does it mean you actually have to fix the problem instantly?
15875160	15877160	No, it does not mean that.
15877160	15878160	What are you?
15878160	15879160	Please.
15879160	15880160	Right.
15880160	15882160	Retrigger each played.
15882160	15884160	Yoink for free.
15884160	15885160	What are you?
15885160	15886160	Permanently gain a hand each round.
15888160	15889160	Mmm.
15891160	15893160	But my pair...
15894160	15896160	Multiplier is also a hollow.
15896160	15897160	Get in my belly.
15897160	15898160	Right now.
15898160	15899160	Let's go.
15899160	15900160	I'll see if I can get this.
15900160	15902160	That would be good to get the pick up.
15902160	15903160	One extra thingy.
15907160	15908160	It would be free.
15909160	15911160	It would be free and we have no economy.
15912160	15915160	It would be free, but we'd have no economy.
15917160	15918160	It's holographic.
15918160	15921160	Next based edition Joker is free and comes holographic.
15921160	15922160	It's free and comes holographic.
15922160	15925160	Are you addicted to Boutro or Strewn?
15925160	15927160	What if I said both?
15928160	15929160	Did you get the free Joker?
15929160	15930160	I did.
15930160	15933160	The free Joker is retriggered each played lower card.
15933160	15935160	And it's called hack.
15935160	15936160	What an interesting name.
15936160	15940160	And then I have Sly Joker, which is a holographic.
15940160	15942160	So he has 10 multi on pairs.
15942160	15944160	So I think we're already doing the pairs.
15946160	15949160	We went from gambling bad to gambling addiction in three days.
15949160	15950160	It's so jover.
15950160	15951160	It's so jover.
15958160	15963160	The reward is $3 plus or a holographic for free.
15966160	15968160	Our economy is so low.
15970160	15972160	I'm needing to build the economy, I think.
15973160	15975160	By the way, hollow is flat multi, not tied to a pair.
15978160	15979160	All right then.
15980160	15981160	All right, you've sold me.
15981160	15982160	You've sold me.
15982160	15983160	All right.
15983160	15985160	Oh, how much?
15985160	15987160	Wait, why is it so big?
15995160	15996160	I need a 10.
15997160	15999160	Let's get rid of all of you then.
16000160	16001160	Wait, what do you do?
16001160	16003160	If I play a pair, right.
16003160	16004160	What happens if I play a pair?
16004160	16006160	This is just a test to see what happens when I play a pair.
16006160	16008160	I'll also play these to get rid of them.
16008160	16009160	What happens if I do a pair?
16009160	16010160	What do you do?
16011160	16012160	Shit.
16012160	16013160	Oh, wait.
16013160	16014160	No, you do fantastic.
16014160	16015160	Do that again.
16015160	16016160	Do it again.
16016160	16017160	Right now.
16017160	16018160	Right in front of me.
16018160	16019160	Oh, that's what I'd like to see.
16019160	16020160	Okay.
16020160	16021160	Okay.
16021160	16022160	Okay.
16022160	16023160	That's what I'd like to see.
16023160	16024160	I had to make sure.
16024160	16025160	I wasn't sure.
16025160	16026160	Okay.
16026160	16027160	I wasn't sure.
16027160	16028160	Right.
16028160	16029160	We made $7.
16029160	16037160	We need one more dollar, one more doll here, and then we can grab this, which is exactly
16037160	16038160	what I want.
16039160	16040160	Oh, wait.
16040160	16041160	Free Joker.
16041160	16042160	Sorry.
16042160	16043160	Sorry, free Joker.
16043160	16044160	15 multi, one in six chance.
16044160	16045160	It gets destroyed though.
16045160	16046160	I mean, it was free.
16046160	16047160	So I'm not going to be mad.
16047160	16048160	Sorry.
16048160	16049160	I am so sorry.
16049160	16052160	I literally raise all your blood pressures when I do that.
16052160	16053160	I just forget.
16053160	16054160	I'm like, oh yeah.
16054160	16055160	Yeah.
16055160	16056160	Right.
16056160	16057160	Oh no.
16057160	16059160	We're not going to have access to this because I skipped a freaking round.
16059160	16060160	Did I?
16060160	16061160	I think so.
16061160	16063160	Can I sell you?
16064160	16069160	So there's a chance it gets destroyed.
16069160	16073160	And I'm like, if there's a chance for it to get destroyed, that's quite high.
16073160	16079160	I'm tempted to just sell it and then buy this for an extra round at a chance.
16079160	16085160	Because if it's going to destroy itself, wait, you guys are celebrating the card though.
16085160	16086160	Oh no.
16086160	16092160	Once it breaks, you can get another Joker called keep the banana at specials free.
16092160	16093160	Okay.
16093160	16096160	I'll keep the banana because I'm not unlocked what the banana does.
16096160	16097160	Okay.
16097160	16100160	Oh, someone says sell though.
16100160	16107160	Someone says sell hack.
16107160	16108160	You know what?
16108160	16109160	Sell hack.
16109160	16110160	And then give me this.
16110160	16113160	I want an extra round to increase my odds of success.
16113160	16115160	One in seven cards gets thrown face down.
16115160	16116160	That's fine.
16116160	16117160	I'll survive.
16117160	16118160	I'll survive.
16118160	16119160	I won't survive.
16119160	16121160	What the heck are you?
16121160	16122160	I don't know.
16122160	16123160	Right.
16123160	16128160	We'll get rid of the two.
16128160	16130160	And the seven and the ten I get.
16130160	16132160	Seven's getting a bit high.
16132160	16133160	You know what?
16133160	16135160	I'll just get rid of these playhounds now.
16135160	16137160	I was four.
16137160	16138160	Curious.
16138160	16139160	Whoa.
16139160	16142160	The molly went off.
16142160	16144160	The molly went off.
16144160	16147160	Don't mind if I do.
16147160	16148160	Right.
16148160	16149160	What are you?
16150160	16151160	Right.
16151160	16153160	Just to ask.
16153160	16154160	Okay.
16154160	16155160	Just to ask.
16155160	16157160	What do you do?
16157160	16159160	Minus the ante though.
16159160	16162160	What?
16162160	16166160	I'm tempted in the ante rewind because we unlocked the hand.
16166160	16170160	So we would be back to what the usual is but one less in difficulty.
16170160	16171160	I am tempted.
16171160	16172160	I'll be honest.
16172160	16174160	Sly Joker.
16174160	16178160	Does Sly Joker compliment three of a kind Joker?
16178160	16179160	Wait.
16179160	16180160	Three of a kind.
16180160	16181160	Yeah.
16181160	16182160	Three of a kind.
16182160	16183160	Sombra Apoc.
16183160	16185160	Thank you for coming to member.
16185160	16186160	I appreciate it.
16186160	16189160	I'm sorry to all members who are waiting on the membership ASMR.
16189160	16191160	I'm a little addicted right now.
16191160	16192160	Need to get economy going.
16192160	16194160	Oh, you're right.
16194160	16205160	But if this is going to reduce the aggro of trying to win, I think we're going to get
16205160	16210160	some easy rounds in.
16210160	16215160	If it reduces the aggro, I think it's the best.
16215160	16219160	It'll give me $9 if I don't play this game.
16219160	16228160	So I take it because I can't make $9 in a round right now.
16228160	16229160	Worth it.
16229160	16230160	Okay.
16230160	16236160	Initial cards and booster packs in the next shop are free.
16236160	16243160	Initial cards and booster packs are free.
16243160	16246160	The booster packs are free.
16246160	16247160	Yeah.
16247160	16249160	This one too.
16249160	16250160	Double skip.
16250160	16252160	I need to leave now.
16252160	16253160	Rest well.
16253160	16254160	Thank you for hanging.
16254160	16255160	I appreciate it.
16255160	16256160	Sorry for being addicted.
16256160	16257160	Worth as well.
16257160	16258160	Okay.
16258160	16261160	Discard two random cards pair hand plate.
16261160	16262160	Oh, no.
16262160	16263160	You mean I get to...
16263160	16264160	Oh, wait.
16264160	16268160	Discard two random cards.
16268160	16276160	Well, the best I can do is this.
16276160	16278160	Oh, wait.
16278160	16279160	In my hand.
16279160	16281160	Oh, well, we won.
16281160	16284160	Oh, well.
16284160	16287160	Thank you, I guess.
16287160	16289160	Everything is free.
16289160	16293160	Earn two bucks pair discard if no discards are used.
16293160	16295160	Thank you.
16295160	16296160	Destroy two cards.
16296160	16299160	I don't know if I want to destroy cards yet.
16299160	16301160	Use two tarot cards.
16301160	16303160	Choose between a joker.
16303160	16305160	Let's go.
16305160	16308160	Each played 10 or four gives 10 chips in a multi.
16308160	16310160	Every played card permanently...
16310160	16311160	Oh, we've just started.
16311160	16313160	So backpack man, you're in.
16313160	16314160	We've just started.
16314160	16317160	Use two tarot cards immediately.
16317160	16319160	We have just started.
16319160	16320160	Hydration check.
16320160	16321160	Yes, little reeflings.
16321160	16324160	Please do hydrate.
16324160	16326160	I like the lucky cards.
16326160	16327160	Creates a random joker.
16327160	16328160	Converts.
16328160	16329160	Nope.
16329160	16330160	Nope.
16330160	16331160	Nope.
16331160	16332160	Okay, it's you.
16332160	16334160	I think it's you.
16334160	16336160	And put it on the kings.
16336160	16338160	I think put it on the kings.
16338160	16343160	Yeah, two kings locked up on the magician.
16343160	16345160	I've got one yes.
16345160	16347160	I've got one yes.
16347160	16349160	I'm getting my hand held.
16349160	16350160	Yeah.
16350160	16351160	Sure, why not?
16351160	16352160	Okay.
16352160	16353160	Good logic then.
16353160	16354160	Oh, look at that.
16354160	16355160	Old tassie.
16355160	16356160	Joker.
16356160	16358160	Convert up to three.
16358160	16359160	Nope.
16359160	16360160	Hot.
16360160	16361160	What does this do?
16361160	16363160	Converts a random joker card.
16363160	16364160	Creates.
16364160	16366160	Sorry, not converts.
16366160	16367160	Creates.
16367160	16368160	I am not going to go like this one.
16368160	16371160	This joker gains a multiplier pair consecutive hand played
16371160	16374160	without playing your most played poker hand.
16374160	16376160	The obelisk.
16376160	16377160	Sure.
16377160	16381160	If we want to destroy...
16381160	16387160	I mean, it's free, so...
16387160	16389160	Maybe we'll hold on to it for now
16389160	16391160	because I don't know if we're going to try and go
16391160	16393160	for certain numbers or whatever.
16393160	16395160	That's a hard...
16395160	16396160	I hope for a good joker.
16396160	16397160	It's kind of hard.
16397160	16399160	I mean, it's just going to happen naturally.
16399160	16403160	Raise the cap on interest earned.
16403160	16404160	Yes.
16404160	16407160	This is good for our economy now.
16407160	16410160	We're only going to be able to get one extra dollar back,
16410160	16412160	but over time, it's going to add up.
16412160	16414160	So let's not beat around the bush.
16414160	16415160	Gives...
16415160	16416160	Nope.
16416160	16417160	I don't know what that means.
16417160	16418160	So we're not playing it.
16418160	16419160	I don't know what it means.
16419160	16420160	Ooh!
16420160	16424160	We've already got double a vase
16424160	16427160	and I'll throw the four away.
16427160	16434160	Play hands.
16434160	16437160	I don't mind if I do.
16437160	16439160	Delayed gratification.
16439160	16441160	Six dollars?
16441160	16443160	Wait, what's delayed gratification?
16443160	16446160	You earn two bucks per discard
16446160	16448160	if no discards are used.
16448160	16453160	That's not delayed gratification.
16453160	16455160	That's faster than I normally finish.
16455160	16458160	What are you on about?
16458160	16461160	Choose one out of four spectra.
16461160	16463160	A bit of a bank card again.
16463160	16465160	Is that when I can enhance a card?
16465160	16466160	Oh, wow.
16466160	16467160	Delayed gratification.
16467160	16471160	We'll get you 50 on Mac interest so fast, yeah.
16471160	16475160	Playing card to add to your deck.
16475160	16478160	We're kind of a straight flush.
16478160	16481160	No, I don't even want to waste my money on a straight flush.
16481160	16483160	Choose...
16484160	16486160	I think I want a max economy.
16486160	16488160	Let's do a max economy right away.
16488160	16490160	One more round and we'll be good to go.
16490160	16495160	I'm needing some joker cards to shape the way I play the game though.
16495160	16497160	I think once this gets destroyed we can pick up.
16497160	16501160	I have a pair joker card.
16501160	16504160	No, let's do a economy please.
16504160	16508160	I do 50 chips if played hand contains a pair.
16508160	16510160	Two pairs, let's go.
16510160	16514160	Get rid of the nine I guess because I've already got a little cheeky pair right here.
16514160	16518160	Joker gains for a hand that's not played.
16518160	16522160	Hanged man on the twos maybe.
16522160	16526160	Just to get them out of the way.
16526160	16529160	See, if Fibonacci comes into play...
16529160	16531160	Full 18!
16531160	16534160	Delayed gratification is nuts.
16534160	16536160	Holy crap.
16536160	16538160	We do have...
16538160	16540160	This is just straight up for multiplayer.
16540160	16542160	My banana's gone!
16542160	16544160	Who took my banana?
16544160	16546160	Give it back right now.
16546160	16548160	Give me my banana back.
16548160	16550160	Great, we're going to get that because that's fantastic.
16550160	16552160	Right multiplayer, do I need to put it in a certain order?
16552160	16554160	Maybe after the obelisk?
16554160	16558160	You don't want to play your best hand every round to scale obelisk.
16558160	16560160	Ooh.
16560160	16564160	Okay, maybe we're probably going to swap out obelisk at some point.
16564160	16566160	Can I get pairs?
16566160	16568160	Pair love, contains a pair.
16568160	16570160	Yes, let's level up Mercury.
16570160	16572160	Nice and simple, we've already got Mercury getting on the thing.
16572160	16574160	Choose one of three playing cards to add to the deck.
16574160	16578160	See, I don't have anything that's shaped in a deck right now.
16578160	16582160	Creates up to two random tarot cards.
16582160	16584160	I mean, we could get the Wheel of Fortune, you know what?
16584160	16586160	We could get the Wheel.
16586160	16588160	Oh.
16588160	16592160	I will sell you, I don't want to use you.
16592160	16594160	You destroy up to two selected.
16594160	16598160	I need some.
16598160	16602160	Maybe just...
16602160	16604160	I don't know.
16604160	16608160	Well, whatever this does, we can buy it because we have 25.
16608160	16610160	Ooh, I want luck.
16610160	16612160	Yeah, I want luck, give me lucky.
16612160	16614160	Lucky, lucky four.
16614160	16616160	Wait, why did you sell what you just bought?
16616160	16618160	I'm not going to use it.
16618160	16620160	I don't like it.
16620160	16622160	I don't like glass cards.
16622160	16626160	Um, your interest cap is no 50.
16626160	16628160	Scam Emperor's Edge, fair enough.
16628160	16630160	Yeah, I don't like the idea of breaking a card.
16630160	16634160	Cards played previously, this auntie, or debuff.
16634160	16638160	That's fain.
16638160	16644160	That's fain, that doesn't hurt me at all.
16644160	16648160	Right, I'm just going to play all this to get rid of it.
16648160	16650160	I think.
16652160	16658160	Okay, what did that do?
16658160	16662160	If I get an ace, I have a straight flush.
16662160	16664160	So just play all of that.
16664160	16666160	I have so many cards I can play.
16666160	16668160	I don't like depending on glass though.
16668160	16670160	Just translate to half a hind man.
16670160	16672160	I make bad cards, glass.
16672160	16674160	Yeah, I think I can...
16674160	16676160	Oh, I do have a straight, you're right.
16676160	16678160	Oh my god, one, two, three, four.
16678160	16680160	Just like that.
16680160	16682160	I forget this straight doesn't have to be an ace.
16682160	16684160	Like a dumb dumb.
16684160	16686160	Oh no.
16686160	16688160	That banana was working overtime.
16688160	16690160	Not going to lie.
16692160	16696160	9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
16696160	16698160	Or 10 maybe.
16698160	16700160	10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
16700160	16702160	Is that just going to do it again?
16702160	16704160	Is that enough?
16704160	16706160	Oh, this isn't looking so good.
16706160	16708160	I think I'll be doing ace more quickly than I thought.
16708160	16710160	Delayed gratification still gave me...
16710160	16712160	What, six dollars?
16712160	16714160	But I didn't do it right.
16714160	16718160	Earn two dollars per discard if no discards are used by the end of the round.
16718160	16722160	Oh, whatever's remaining at times it by two.
16722160	16724160	Okay, so three times two is six.
16724160	16726160	Okay, okay.
16726160	16728160	Big economy, let's go.
16730160	16732160	Joker, turret, planet and spectral cards may appear multiple times.
16732160	16734160	What's that mean?
16734160	16736160	Foil, holographics are more likely.
16736160	16738160	But that's just for a chance.
16738160	16740160	Oh, we've got two celestials though.
16740160	16744160	Hold on, let's do mega, cheeky mega celestials.
16744160	16748160	We've got Mercury, straight on Mercury.
16748160	16750160	Pairs, let's go. Shout out to all my pairs.
16752160	16754160	Three of a kind contains a pair.
16754160	16760160	So I am tempted to do three of a kind because it's more likely to occur.
16760160	16762160	And then we'll do jumbo.
16762160	16766160	Udinus, two pairs.
16766160	16768160	Yeah, two pairs.
16768160	16770160	Let's try that.
16770160	16772160	Let's even out the kind of pairing match up setup.
16774160	16776160	Should I do that?
16778160	16780160	I don't know, I would put my economy below but...
16782160	16784160	But...
16784160	16788160	The economy is going very well with delayed gratification.
16788160	16790160	Going the all render.
16790160	16794160	Showman is tricky but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have lots of money.
16796160	16798160	Remember that max economy is 50.
16798160	16800160	Oh, it stays 50?
16802160	16804160	So I'm burning through my max economy.
16812160	16816160	Delayed gratifications giving us like 50 bucks around.
16820160	16836160	I know I shouldn't be greedy but can create two common jokers.
16836160	16838160	I don't even have room.
16838160	16840160	I don't even have room.
16840160	16842160	You can be a little greedy.
16844160	16848160	We've got a triple and nothing else actually.
16850160	16852160	Just use these up.
16852160	16854160	Let's see if we can get our double four.
16856160	16858160	Don't forget to hydrate.
16862160	16864160	98765.
16866160	16868160	Just like that.
16868160	16870160	All done.
16872160	16874160	Good luck on the straight.
16876160	16878160	Cash out to 15.
16878160	16880160	Getting this game was a mistake.
16880160	16882160	I'm fucking addicted.
16882160	16884160	Celestial pack jumbo.
16888160	16890160	Oh, I love streamer luck.
16890160	16894160	It's real and unfathomable with a base.
16896160	16898160	What joker was that?
16898160	16900160	Sorry, I keep burning through.
16900160	16902160	One discard each round.
16902160	16904160	Wait, are you...
16904160	16906160	You thing you play into this one?
16906160	16908160	I'm wondering if I should get rid of the obelisk.
16910160	16918160	I technically am going to make $2 extra every time this guy is hanging out with the obelisk.
16918160	16920160	You still have a slot?
16920160	16922160	What did you call me?
16922160	16924160	What did you call me, Riffin?
16924160	16926160	Tarot card. Choose one tarot card.
16926160	16928160	No, let's...
16928160	16930160	Hold on to some economy.
16930160	16932160	It gives us a spectral function.
16932160	16934160	I...
16934160	16936160	Exactly, that's what I thought.
16936160	16938160	$2 double Vs.
16946160	16948160	Five chips every time.
16948160	16950160	It's plead. And the same round.
16952160	16954160	Forever.
16954160	16956160	Oh yeah, yeah, upgrade.
16956160	16958160	Oh wow, okay, holy crap.
16958160	16960160	I'm starting to...
16960160	16962160	Get it. Mildly.
16962160	16964160	I'm starting to get it.
16964160	16966160	I want to upgrade all my...
16966160	16968160	Everything then, I guess.
16968160	16970160	Oh wait, the four didn't count.
16970160	16972160	Sorry, I'm not paying attention.
16972160	16974160	I'm just having fun putting it together.
16974160	16976160	I think they've got me. I'm sorry.
16976160	16978160	I think I've been hook, lain, and sinkered.
16978160	16980160	Hook, lain, and sink...
16980160	16982160	What? Hook, lain, and sinker!
16982160	16984160	There.
16984160	16986160	Okay, there we go.
16986160	16988160	I'm not like paying attention because we don't have to sweat just yet.
16988160	16990160	But when we have to start sweating,
16990160	16992160	don't think I won't be looking at you as reference
16992160	16994160	for advice, because I don't know what I'm doing.
16994160	16996160	Delayed gratification gave us...
16996160	16998160	Fuah. See? We've already made it back.
17002160	17004160	Played cards with clubs gives a molly.
17004160	17006160	One molly per tarot card used.
17006160	17008160	This run?
17008160	17010160	Wait!
17012160	17014160	I'ma start flying left and right with tarot cards.
17014160	17016160	If that... If I comprehend this correctly...
17020160	17022160	If I comprehend this correctly,
17022160	17024160	throw that out
17024160	17026160	and then put that in
17026160	17028160	and then go nuts buying stuff.
17028160	17030160	Sell your red joker?
17030160	17032160	This guy?
17032160	17034160	I think sell the obelisk
17034160	17036160	because I'm only going to want to do pairs.
17038160	17040160	Yeah, I want to sell the obelisk.
17040160	17042160	It works. I'm using it right now.
17042160	17044160	Are you playing? Are you playing?
17044160	17046160	At the same time as me?
17046160	17048160	You're supposed to give me advice!
17048160	17050160	You're supposed to tell me how to win.
17050160	17052160	You've got to play it on your own.
17052160	17054160	Right, sell the obelisk because the obelisk
17054160	17056160	is going to start getting a bit useless.
17058160	17060160	Tarot card buy.
17060160	17062160	So you'll multiply.
17062160	17064160	I'm going to start dropping tarot cards
17064160	17066160	left and right. That's all I'm saying.
17066160	17068160	Celestial pack? Let's go.
17068160	17070160	Oh!
17070160	17072160	Mercury.
17072160	17074160	Oh, we love to see it mercury.
17074160	17076160	We do. And then use two
17076160	17078160	two Tarots. Right, let's go.
17078160	17080160	The Wheel of Fortune.
17080160	17082160	Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on.
17082160	17084160	Don't get... Hold on. Hold on. Pause. Pause. Pause.
17084160	17086160	Don't get too ahead of yourself.
17086160	17088160	I still need to read because I don't know what to do.
17088160	17090160	Left card comes to right.
17090160	17092160	Create two planetary cards.
17092160	17094160	Curious. Create the last Tarot card.
17094160	17096160	Oop!
17098160	17100160	Create the last Tarot card or Planet card
17100160	17102160	used during this run.
17102160	17104160	The full is excluded. Mercury.
17104160	17106160	I can level up pairs again with a full.
17110160	17112160	Use the full.
17112160	17114160	We're using the full.
17114160	17116160	We're going to use that now.
17116160	17118160	We're also going to delete some cards.
17118160	17120160	No, we're not. We have to use it in-game apparently.
17120160	17122160	Rude. And then it's my little guy.
17122160	17124160	Oh my god, he's up at four!
17124160	17126160	Right. And then imagine
17126160	17128160	he gets hit with the Wheel of Fortune though.
17132160	17134160	It's hard to use the Wheel.
17134160	17136160	You can use the Hanged Mana.
17136160	17138160	I just need to select.
17138160	17140160	Oh, my apologies. Okay.
17140160	17142160	Let's just get rid of the lower ones then.
17144160	17146160	Okay. Do we get rid of the lower ones?
17146160	17148160	Right. Hydration. Sorry.
17148160	17150160	My tea's getting cold again.
17152160	17154160	I cannae stream and drink tea at the same time.
17154160	17156160	All the cheese, honestly.
17158160	17160160	My Apocrates.
17160160	17162160	Yeah, I don't have anything that is telling me
17162160	17164160	unless the Fibonacci comes up
17164160	17166160	instantly after this.
17166160	17168160	Then four and six.
17168160	17170160	I mean, we could bet the Fibonacci shows up.
17170160	17172160	If we do four and six then...
17172160	17174160	Yeah.
17178160	17180160	Fuck it. We're going to see.
17180160	17182160	He's up at five now.
17182160	17184160	Multi-Cards.
17184160	17186160	Planet.
17186160	17188160	Possibly.
17188160	17190160	Planet Earth.
17190160	17192160	Risk it.
17192160	17194160	I ain't risk it.
17194160	17196160	No!
17196160	17198160	But it went up though.
17198160	17200160	It went up though. That's all I care about.
17200160	17202160	Money go up. First hand is drawn face down.
17204160	17206160	Thanks, I guess.
17208160	17210160	We have five turns. Four discards.
17212160	17214160	Hear me out.
17214160	17216160	Just go for it.
17218160	17220160	Yeah.
17220160	17222160	Just go for it.
17224160	17226160	Yeah. Okay.
17226160	17228160	We got a double ten!
17230160	17232160	We got four thousand for that little cheeky move there.
17232160	17234160	We'll do the eights and then we'll
17234160	17236160	unflip all of these guys as well.
17236160	17238160	I know it's not going to be a thing
17238160	17240160	but we'll unflip them.
17242160	17244160	Beautiful. Stunning.
17244160	17246160	Gorgeous.
17246160	17248160	You just love this game.
17248160	17250160	It goes there. Identify yourself.
17250160	17252160	We're actually going to have to do a discard
17252160	17254160	because there's nothing we can do.
17254160	17256160	That's actually really rare.
17256160	17258160	Normally we can always do something every round.
17260160	17262160	One, two, three, four, five.
17262160	17264160	I know I should keep that but we're literally a thousand off
17264160	17266160	so just do a discard.
17266160	17268160	If I play it, I get to keep a dollar.
17268160	17270160	I get to keep two dollars
17270160	17272160	if I don't use the discard
17272160	17274160	so I'm just going to play nothing.
17276160	17278160	Lucky can give you cash.
17278160	17280160	So we're just going to play nothing
17280160	17282160	and do a high card or whatever you call it.
17282160	17284160	Alright, there we go.
17284160	17286160	We got troops.
17286160	17288160	Well, then that's it.
17288160	17290160	Okay.
17292160	17294160	Yay!
17296160	17298160	I'll try to finish my tea.
17298160	17300160	There we go. 18 for that one round.
17300160	17302160	Fantastic.
17302160	17304160	Reroll boss blind one time per anti.
17304160	17306160	10 bucks though
17306160	17308160	to do that.
17308160	17310160	If we get a really...
17310160	17312160	Choose one of four joker cards.
17312160	17314160	No!
17314160	17316160	Of course when I pick up tarot cards
17316160	17318160	it doesn't give me tarot cards.
17320160	17322160	Use run info to check the boss blind.
17322160	17324160	Run info?
17324160	17326160	Blinds. Wait, can I see what's up ahead?
17328160	17330160	Play only one type.
17330160	17332160	This is upcoming.
17332160	17334160	What's vouchers?
17334160	17336160	Oh, this is what I have.
17336160	17338160	Vouchers redeem this run.
17338160	17340160	Okay.
17340160	17342160	I completely forgot I got all these.
17342160	17344160	I'm not very smart, I mean.
17344160	17346160	No, only one hand, yeah.
17346160	17348160	Only one type.
17348160	17350160	Play only one hand type this round.
17350160	17352160	How does that work?
17352160	17354160	How the heck is that supposed to work?
17354160	17356160	All flushes?
17360160	17362160	One...
17362160	17364160	One kind of hand.
17364160	17366160	Only for peers.
17366160	17368160	Well, better be peers.
17368160	17370160	Choose two of up to five playing cards
17370160	17372160	to add to the deck.
17372160	17374160	I'm not even wanting that, if I'm being honest.
17374160	17376160	I'm wanting tarot.
17376160	17384160	Do I want this in my back pocket?
17388160	17390160	Decisions, decisions.
17390160	17392160	Yeah, have it in my back pocket?
17392160	17394160	Okay.
17394160	17396160	I don't know how to utilize it,
17396160	17398160	but I'm not wanting anything else for this.
17398160	17400160	Gives a spectral pattern.
17400160	17402160	No, I need tarot cards.
17407160	17410160	The game's pleasing me dry a little bit here.
17410160	17412160	You're not really giving me much to work with.
17412160	17414160	Literally a double, and that's it.
17416160	17418160	Just play that and get rid of it all.
17418160	17420160	Like, the game has not been nice to me.
17420160	17422160	Unless I'm missing something obvious,
17422160	17424160	that was not a nice pull.
17424160	17426160	Heart flush?
17426160	17428160	Shit.
17428160	17430160	For...
17430160	17432160	King, Queen Jack 10.
17432160	17434160	So I need an Ace or a Nine.
17436160	17438160	I'm so sorry.
17438160	17440160	I don't see things the way you see it.
17440160	17442160	I could do...
17442160	17444160	I could do Jacks, I can't.
17444160	17446160	King like that.
17446160	17448160	And get rid of the...
17448160	17450160	Oh, but four is like a good bonus.
17450160	17452160	Like, ever do these, maybe?
17454160	17456160	Aren't her pairs worth more than flushes anyway?
17456160	17458160	Very plausible.
17460160	17462160	My pair is level six right now, so...
17462160	17464160	RNG gods?
17464160	17466160	Thank you.
17474160	17476160	Oh yeah, my pairs are worth way more.
17476160	17478160	Shout out to all my pairs.
17478160	17480160	Cash out.
17480160	17482160	Ooh, what are you?
17482160	17484160	Allow straights to be played with gaps in them.
17484160	17486160	Well, I'm actually doubled out.
17486160	17488160	You're too late to show up.
17488160	17490160	I'm already down on doubles.
17490160	17492160	Give 20 more chips and a multiplier.
17496160	17498160	Well, we're going to get our tarot card multiplier up.
17498160	17500160	So...
17500160	17502160	It's a hollow joker though.
17502160	17504160	Is that what I'm looking at?
17504160	17506160	Actually sell the four plus joker and buy the straight cards.
17508160	17510160	And buy this one?
17512160	17514160	Not the scholar, buy the...
17514160	17516160	straight cards.
17516160	17518160	The straight card is 10 multiplier.
17518160	17520160	Okay, I trust you, Reeflings.
17520160	17522160	You're gating me.
17522160	17524160	Okay, that's a 10 multiplier.
17524160	17526160	Okay, and then we'll do our tarot cards
17526160	17528160	because we can get...
17528160	17530160	this will go up.
17530160	17532160	Enhance to two lucky cards.
17532160	17534160	Enhance us to the bonus cards
17534160	17536160	or create a random joker.
17536160	17538160	I think...
17538160	17540160	we'll do lucky cards.
17542160	17544160	Yeah, let's make these two lucky.
17544160	17546160	Let's make these two lucky.
17548160	17550160	It could be good, but you probably have to sell the drunk jack.
17552160	17554160	This game is actually insane
17554160	17556160	with how deep it goes.
17556160	17558160	It's fantastic.
17558160	17560160	It's honestly fantastic.
17560160	17562160	I'm loving it.
17562160	17564160	So I can get 19 bucks back.
17564160	17566160	I can get a planet.
17566160	17568160	I can do the lucky card again.
17568160	17570160	I'm tempted to do the lucky card.
17570160	17572160	I really enjoy the luck.
17572160	17574160	I really enjoy the luck factor
17574160	17576160	because
17576160	17578160	a 20 multiplier is insane.
17580160	17582160	Priestess gives you two planets though.
17590160	17592160	I love the luck factor,
17592160	17594160	but you're right.
17594160	17596160	Two planets, I could upgrade everything.
17596160	17598160	Well, not everything.
17598160	17600160	I could upgrade
17600160	17602160	and play.
17602160	17604160	Priestess might actually be better in this situation.
17606160	17608160	Okay, okay.
17608160	17610160	What we got? We've got four of a kind
17610160	17612160	and a full house. I mean, we're just going to utilize them.
17612160	17614160	I don't have a problem with utilizing them.
17616160	17618160	Right, and then we'll go next.
17618160	17620160	I am not interested in you.
17622160	17624160	Every played card permanently gains five chips.
17624160	17626160	I'm already on that.
17626160	17628160	So what are you? Allow straights to be played
17628160	17630160	in a gap.
17632160	17634160	Wait.
17634160	17636160	That example works?
17636160	17638160	Wait, it's not like five, four, three,
17638160	17640160	one and...
17644160	17646160	Wait, I'm just going to be doing straights
17646160	17648160	all day long then.
17648160	17650160	Am I misunderstanding?
17650160	17652160	We rose in the next shop for zero.
17654160	17656160	And a 10 plus multiplier on top.
17656160	17658160	Oh, is it the 10 multi?
17658160	17660160	That is what we're wanting it for.
17662160	17664160	So you can play very weird straights now.
17664160	17666160	My brain can hardly
17666160	17668160	like, comprehend. So what?
17668160	17670160	One, two,
17670160	17672160	skip a few.
17672160	17674160	Ten, skip eight.
17674160	17676160	No way!
17678160	17680160	That's redonkulous.
17680160	17682160	That doesn't make sense,
17682160	17684160	but it does!
17686160	17688160	It just works!
17688160	17690160	All right, Todd Howard.
17690160	17692160	You can't down there, good sir.
17692160	17694160	Hurry up with my Skyrim six already.
17694160	17696160	I'm winning.
17696160	17698160	Whoa, that's mean-blowing!
17700160	17702160	Eleven, ten.
17702160	17704160	Eight.
17704160	17706160	Well, that's ten, technically.
17706160	17708160	Nine and eight. Wow!
17708160	17710160	How bizarre!
17710160	17712160	I'm like twiddling
17712160	17714160	my hair right now
17714160	17716160	in between my fingers.
17716160	17718160	Like, what?
17718160	17720160	How strange.
17720160	17722160	So king, queen,
17722160	17724160	jack, ten, nine,
17724160	17726160	seven.
17726160	17728160	And what? And then we need a five
17728160	17730160	or six?
17730160	17732160	What?
17734160	17736160	All right, okay, okay, hold on.
17736160	17738160	What have we got? We've got doubles.
17738160	17740160	Let's do doubles.
17740160	17742160	That's blowing my mind.
17742160	17744160	Wait, have I got straight again?
17744160	17746160	No. Wait, no.
17746160	17748160	Have I?
17748160	17750160	King, queen, jack, ten, nine,
17750160	17752160	eight, seven. No!
17752160	17754160	Wait, that's so hard!
17754160	17756160	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
17756160	17758160	That's like so weird!
17758160	17760160	How common is that card?
17760160	17762160	How common is that card?
17774160	17776160	Okay, so there's
17776160	17778160	three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
17780160	17782160	It worked!
17782160	17784160	Why does it work?
17784160	17786160	Wait, this card is so OP.
17786160	17788160	Danny, you put my stonks in the streets?
17788160	17790160	I think Danny, you put my stonks in the streets.
17792160	17794160	King, queen, jack,
17794160	17796160	ten, nine.
17796160	17798160	Okay, I don't have that.
17798160	17800160	Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
17800160	17802160	ten. Okay, so I don't have it that way.
17804160	17806160	Go in all in on streets.
17806160	17808160	I think so.
17808160	17810160	I think we need to maybe swap off
17810160	17812160	repair. Oh no, but that's got a ten plus on it.
17814160	17816160	Does that activate in general?
17816160	17818160	Okay, I'm going to get rid of all the...
17818160	17820160	Oh wait, no, I don't want to get rid of them.
17820160	17822160	I don't think so. I just want to get rid of the kings.
17822160	17824160	Because we're like so close to another street.
17824160	17826160	Oh, it's the end of the round.
17826160	17828160	Oh.
17828160	17830160	How bizarre, right?
17830160	17832160	Let me finish this game.
17832160	17834160	It's cold!
17834160	17836160	I can't help it.
17836160	17838160	Remaining hand, money, interest.
17838160	17840160	Oh, I got rid of my...
17840160	17842160	No.
17842160	17844160	Why did that not...
17844160	17846160	Why did you not activate?
17846160	17848160	Earn two bucks
17848160	17850160	per discard if no discards are used.
17850160	17852160	Oh, if none of them are used.
17852160	17854160	Okay, at all.
17854160	17856160	Right, what's going on here?
17858160	17860160	I've already had you, so
17860160	17862160	I don't want you.
17862160	17864160	There is another to make it that you only need floor cards
17864160	17866160	to make flushes and streets.
17866160	17868160	The Joker has literally changed the entire game.
17870160	17872160	We have...we've got a turret card
17872160	17874160	so we can increase our multiplier at
17874160	17876160	8 to 9.
17876160	17878160	Yes, please, sir.
17878160	17880160	What have we got? Planets.
17880160	17882160	Joker, we don't need.
17882160	17884160	Double's money.
17884160	17886160	That gives us 20.
17886160	17888160	That would give us full economy.
17890160	17892160	Wait, that gives us two more turret cards?
17892160	17894160	Which gives us even more of a multiplier.
17894160	17896160	Emperor.
17896160	17898160	Emperor?
17898160	17900160	Emperor.
17900160	17902160	Yeah, okay.
17902160	17904160	That turns us to what?
17904160	17906160	10?
17906160	17908160	Wait, that turns us to 11?
17908160	17910160	Enhance something into a wealth card.
17910160	17912160	Use the wheel.
17912160	17914160	I never got it.
17914160	17916160	But is that 10 now? Enhances one selected card
17916160	17918160	into a wild card.
17918160	17920160	I don't know what a wild card is.
17920160	17922160	But in Binding of Isaac,
17922160	17924160	we've got a wild card.
17924160	17926160	You hear an audio cue and the guy goes wild card.
17926160	17928160	I just thought you should know that.
17930160	17932160	Right, we will pick a planet to upgrade as well
17932160	17934160	because
17934160	17936160	I guess we want straight.
17936160	17938160	Not straight flush.
17938160	17940160	That's very unlikely
17940160	17942160	but a straight wild card.
17942160	17944160	Sorry, I'm stuck in my head now.
17944160	17946160	Saturn.
17946160	17948160	Cumberboard Saturn.
17948160	17950160	Right, you...
17950160	17952160	You don't have a multiplier with your foil.
17952160	17954160	You have 50 chips
17954160	17956160	which I'm not really sure.
17956160	17958160	Saturn.
17958160	17960160	Sell the drunk Joker.
17960160	17962160	The drunk Joker.
17962160	17964160	I have
17964160	17966160	the drunk card.
17966160	17968160	Sell the drunk card.
17970160	17972160	I would pick the foil Joker
17972160	17974160	and switch it for the discard.
17974160	17976160	Okay, thank you.
17976160	17978160	You and you come.
17978160	17980160	God ranks give chips when...
17980160	17982160	Okay, okay.
17982160	17984160	I comprehend interesting.
17984160	17986160	I like it. I'll use the lover's card
17986160	17988160	and then our multiplier will go to what?
17988160	17990160	Ten.
17990160	17992160	Fantastic.
17992160	17994160	Fan.
17994160	17996160	Chips.
17996160	17998160	That's kind of scary.
17998160	18000160	Play only one hand this round.
18000160	18002160	I'm a bit nervous.
18002160	18004160	Alright.
18008160	18010160	Enhance one into a wild card.
18010160	18012160	One hand type.
18012160	18014160	So...
18014160	18016160	Go with either pairs or straights.
18016160	18018160	Play only straight.
18020160	18022160	I don't have a straight.
18022160	18024160	No ASMR.
18024160	18026160	No, it's coming. Once we redirect into Azure
18026160	18028160	I'm doing my ASMR.
18028160	18030160	You might hear the birds outside though.
18030160	18032160	That's only...
18032160	18034160	That's only done so I didn't ASMR a bit later.
18034160	18036160	Hand type.
18036160	18038160	You can just play straights.
18038160	18040160	Ten, nine, eight, seven,
18040160	18042160	six, five, four.
18042160	18044160	Right, so I need to get rid of
18044160	18046160	all of these.
18046160	18048160	Even the four?
18048160	18050160	Wild card.
18050160	18052160	Sorry, that's really stuck in my head.
18052160	18054160	I'll discard these
18054160	18056160	and we'll go for a flush.
18056160	18058160	Discard some sevens.
18058160	18062160	Ten, nine, eight, sevens.
18062160	18064160	Help.
18064160	18066160	Jeez, I'm a waste. Do you guys not want me
18066160	18068160	to win or something? What's going on here?
18068160	18070160	King is very far away from ten.
18072160	18074160	Wait, I got a straight. Stop. Stop.
18074160	18076160	Where?
18076160	18078160	I don't have a straight.
18078160	18080160	King.
18080160	18082160	Queen. Jack.
18084160	18086160	Ace, king, ten.
18089160	18092160	Wait, queen and joker.
18092160	18094160	Queen and jack get skipped
18094160	18096160	between these two?
18096160	18098160	No, you said a flush.
18098160	18100160	Wait, never mind. Yeah.
18100160	18102160	Toss one of the nine and keep a ten.
18102160	18104160	She wants straights,
18104160	18106160	not flushes. No, you can't make a straight.
18106160	18108160	I didn't think so.
18110160	18112160	So ditch this nine and these two.
18112160	18114160	Discard nine of hearts, discard four.
18114160	18116160	But not three? Why not three?
18116160	18118160	Why not three?
18118160	18120160	Wait a minute, why did you not mention the three?
18124160	18126160	I don't know.
18128160	18130160	I'm going to need to make a play.
18130160	18132160	My discards are getting off.
18132160	18134160	Okay, here we go. Here we go.
18136160	18138160	Yeah, okay, right.
18138160	18140160	Lovers, what's a wild card though?
18140160	18142160	That I put ten on?
18142160	18144160	That I just randomly put the ace on a wild card?
18144160	18146160	Sure, what does it do? I don't know.
18148160	18150160	Can be used as any suit.
18150160	18152160	Sure.
18152160	18154160	Play.
18160160	18162160	Nine, eight, seven.
18162160	18164160	Shit.
18164160	18166160	We've, oh no, we've fucked it.
18166160	18168160	We've fucked it.
18172160	18174160	We've ballsed it up.
18176160	18178160	I've ballsed it up because I used so many discards.
18178160	18180160	Used the last discard.
18180160	18182160	Reroll a three and a two.
18182160	18184160	Man, you're actually getting awful draws.
18184160	18186160	Streamer Luck can only lead stretch so far.
18188160	18190160	Discard all the threes and twos.
18190160	18192160	And the four?
18192160	18194160	Or not the four?
18194160	18196160	Jobu Nogo.
18196160	18198160	Thank you for the membership.
18198160	18200160	I appreciate it.
18200160	18202160	You have a good basis though.
18202160	18204160	For a lot of straights.
18204160	18206160	So get rid of this side. Leave the four.
18206160	18208160	I'd keep the four, not the four.
18208160	18210160	Just the threes and the twos.
18210160	18212160	Last discard.
18212160	18214160	It's either make or break.
18214160	18216160	Um...
18222160	18224160	Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four!
18230160	18232160	Ok, ok let them get up, let them get up, let them get up!
18232160	18234160	Hold on.
18234160	18236160	Oh, thank goodness, that was not fun.
18236160	18238160	I didn't enjoy that.
18238160	18240160	Don't do that to me again.
18240160	18248800	absolutely we'll muck around with tarot cards no problem wait what's this one
18248800	18258060	consumable slot so I can have even more tarot cards mega arcane use two
18258060	18262980	tarots right we're gonna buy and use the planets right now got a bit of
18262980	18268540	Uranus please use and a bit of Venus please use for three of a kind
18268540	18272740	unfortunately didn't roll Saturn which is what we were wanting but that's fine
18272740	18281740	tarot open up please come to me right ladies and gentlemen we can double money
18281740	18287700	for a max of 20 which we can achieve create a card destroy two cards increase
18287700	18295440	the rank and mid game or enhance one selected card into a stone card when
18295440	18302520	can you use vouchers mid game I mean no vouchers always occur oh actually yeah I
18302520	18310200	don't know when the director's cut could be activated 20 is 20 you're you are
18310200	18314160	factually correct I am inclined to agree actually don't want to destroy
18314160	18319160	anything because if we've now got this weird suit thing going on destroying is
18319160	18323160	bad we don't want Joker that's useless we don't really need to change anything
18323320	18327440	into the same thing because we're going for a weird flush so yeah hermit is our
18327440	18334200	only option there we go 20 bucks right not you not you again don't want to
18334200	18341280	destroy cards or create a Joker wow okay this is useless is this a skip all
18341280	18349520	but but our multiplier you know what I can take it I don't want to actually use
18349560	18354320	it I thought it was gonna let me take it and then I could just sell it yeah I
18354320	18364960	thought I could take it I destroy high and low no the problem is we have what's
18364960	18371240	called shortcut it allows straights to be inaccurate you could bump the three and
18371240	18378160	fours to four and five centering the value you know what you like beyond a
18378160	18384440	certain what do you want me to do you can bump the three and fours wait so
18384440	18392800	should I make the three or four and then that would raise the bar
18392800	18403720	increase the strip the rank increases rank of the two cards selected by one
18403720	18413000	card okay okay that was good we are now 14 multiply which is fantastic we don't
18413000	18417920	need a Joker we don't need a consumable slot we're actually about to hit max
18417960	18423320	economy which is fantastic for us because our little discards this one
18423320	18431360	really isn't hitting it isn't hitting as hard anymore so I might want to
18431360	18437960	replace but gives us a negative Joker slot on the domestic is an extra slot so
18437960	18445760	I can't get rid of it right next round delayed gratifications and I am
18445800	18453280	learning and make a standard pack no I want that rocked cards right we can
18453280	18457800	still do our little Duble V at the moment was at nine wait hold on five six
18457800	18468840	seven eight nine ten oh wait that's a flush I think I'm better doing my pairs
18468840	18476400	yeah pairs are better right now so just throw them away and go for a little
18476400	18481640	flush I don't know maybe it's terrible sorry for folk that sorry for folk that
18481640	18488560	but I'm trying well I got 13k for that yeah seven six five four three two one
18488560	18492480	of course I'm not gonna card that would be too easy let's just do doubles I think
18492480	18497840	we've got all we can do a full house and yeah because a single pair is heavily
18497840	18503000	boosted single pair please better than two pairs wait
18503160	18517400	single pair who says single pair please better who says run info how do you do
18517400	18524640	the mass straight flush two pair is 60 times four
18527840	18533600	oh wow wait it was 85 times seven that's a big number
18533600	18539560	wait oh no don't maybe the math oh no you're right a single pair is far
18539560	18548240	stronger wow okay and what are you odd numbers so a double seven is stronger
18548240	18555160	than a Wow this game wait wait wait let me I know give me I need to some
18555160	18562840	freaking math in my head I'm like that's a bigger number you're right 11,000
18562840	18568680	for two singular pair wow we need that half cut off card again and we're laughing
18568680	18580280	to the bank hmm right we've got 69 bucks play played face card gives 30 right
18580280	18584840	I'm gonna buy this because our economy is good and we've got two tarot cards
18585120	18590920	let's do you thank you redeemed thank you right jumbo what see what we're
18590920	18597760	dealing with give us a suit right no to the glass card and the last thing we
18597760	18601280	used was strength which I've already forgotten what does it in this game I
18601280	18607680	think strength increases your health by one in Isaac as well as a speed and
18607680	18616640	possibly damage 69 nice big bank of our it says there oh increases rank of
18616640	18626640	two selected cards ah so we are officially created a five and four so
18626640	18632560	can we just do it again anyway two selected car no enhance one into a
18632560	18638720	wild card sorry convert no right actually yeah the fool is the best thing
18638720	18644800	we can probably do right here so we made an artificial five that isn't really a
18644800	18660800	five but we can bump up to a six so there should be a double five okay hearts
18660800	18669760	have a double five which is fine so you have more fives than normal and less
18669760	18677160	threes so I don't want to read you don't have to worry too much if you use the
18677160	18690560	fuel it will go back to the shop yeah and spades doesn't have a three I'm not
18690560	18694840	smart enough to do it
18694840	18707760	huh my dumb very dumb very dumb it's okay I'm allowed to be dumb make two lucky
18707760	18717640	cards hearts or a steel card chariot oh this is hard because I'm trying to do
18718360	18724880	what a straight so having a chariot on standby I don't know if I'm better because
18724880	18729360	I'm going to be going through so many cards it might be better to have two
18729360	18741000	lucky cards steal the three really and then hope the other cards are straight
18741000	18743560	when I get them
18746120	18753480	not do this now oh I can do that now hold on right what my two strengths use
18753480	18757880	strength here first yes sorry I noticed I was gonna do that and what is steel
18757880	18763960	steel is a 1.5 multiplier if it just sits in your hand like you don't utilize it
18763960	18772120	it gives a big thing use strength on three and four I guess since they're low
18772120	18777640	numbers we want to bump everything upwards of five so we can always push
18777640	18784040	towards and you can save strength using as an emergency the multiplier though
18784040	18790520	we're at 15 multiplier just on fortune teller so I'm just gonna go balls to the
18790520	18798240	wall with it we're now at 16 multiplier right and then we'll lose oh someone
18798240	18805000	wants me to steal you can save now well I've already used it now strength on five
18805000	18814960	and four what about multi steal the four okay I'm doing it I'm doing as a
18814960	18820320	reflander man we're now 17 multiply which is fantastic four of a kind I'm not
18820320	18828280	even going for you let's go next please nah I don't need free jokers I've got
18828280	18833920	quite an interesting joker right King Queen Jack 1098 well there you go
18833920	18847880	straight already yes yes 13,000 for that what we already got a little baby
18847880	18854920	straight over here oh no we don't close to no cigar and these Kings are gonna
18854920	18861000	give insanely good stuff but the I'm so close to getting something here I'm
18861000	18865800	wondering if I should just throw that away and go for like a low straight I do
18865800	18869520	have a pair of Kings oh wait yeah that's right I have a pair shut up tell my
18869520	18874360	pairs I still have a pair boom because I'd leveled up pairs so much going all
18874360	18883680	in with them right King Queen Jack 10 I don't have a baby pair I have three
18883680	18893720	rounds so I'm not very stressed out about it I'm just gonna play this pair here
18893720	18897680	and kind of clear out the inventory and try and go high for a bit because I did
18897680	18903520	put my money into high like making other cards at a higher value so yes not
18903560	18907120	problem not problem we're getting there delayed gratification 21 bucks don't
18907120	18912800	mind if I do oh this joker gains two Maltese of hand played contains two
18912800	18926800	pair brah we're trying to swap straight I need tarot cars give me tarot yes I
18926800	18938840	can buy diamonds the chariot oh wait enhance one slighted card into a steel
18938840	18943960	card I wouldn't mind doing that again honestly creates up to two random well
18943960	18948280	that's even more the Emperor's just infinite glitch seven yeah what's it
18948280	18954000	okay glass car and don't actually want to use it on a wild car oh wait oh no I'm
18954080	18960080	inventory I actually don't want to make a glass card enhance one selected card
18960080	18971120	into a gold card if I buy this oh oh wait I can hold three oh my gosh I'm so
18971120	18976280	smart choose up to one of three playing cards add to the deck let's give it a
18977240	18987120	peach create a planet card for final played poker hand around if held in hand
18987120	18994640	must have room I mean a 10 is high and either way it's like good if we get any
18994640	18999160	more cards that are in the higher end of things that's just a free Saturn got it
18999480	19006600	say less say less are we considering this Joker I don't think so it says two
19006600	19012160	pairs but we're doing straights from around here so no thank you we're going
19012160	19016240	to go ham using all of these and then we are going to get a 20 multiplier from
19016240	19024440	fortune teller alone the pants might be better than your right most Joker this
19024600	19031600	good this gives chips but not multiplayer I mean you might be right this
19031600	19038720	just gives chips but the multiplayer is so much better I wouldn't I wouldn't give
19038720	19044800	odd Todd I if anything I'd actually sell hiker isn't hiker not adding so much to
19044800	19052840	the game because I got him at the start that gives one point five on the multi
19052840	19059440	to hikers add in a lot of chips in the background hikers still very valuable I
19059440	19062680	think because I had him at the start is valuable if he showed up late game
19062680	19068280	completely agree with you like no and that's the 10 multiplayer not getting
19068280	19072120	rid of that definitely not getting rid of that so really it is as odd Todd is
19072120	19082040	goner and but hiker doesn't add much now slide joker is probably the worst
19082040	19091000	what I've got right now but he's a 10 holographic 10 multiplier but you could
19091000	19095240	survive without him right now hiker added the value already doesn't go away
19095240	19105400	right even after you sell it 1.5 versus 10 chips okay I think you're right it's
19105400	19114120	either hiker or odd Todd too this is a situation where any of the choices might
19114120	19120800	be good because I am doing so much straight stuff like with straights it
19120800	19125320	might be better to keep odd Todd and get rid of the hiker since he's just he's
19125320	19132840	very he's doing increasing very slowly so I am gonna make a mistake and pick
19132840	19136680	hiker but that's my gut is telling me hiker doesn't make sense at this point
19136680	19142520	in time the Joker games to a multiplier of played hands contain two pairs so
19142520	19149960	we're gonna do a few pairs on purpose on poor pause and we will also utilize all
19149960	19161400	these cards and so we oh it's the last run base chips and multis are halved the
19161400	19176760	flint okay I want to keep you nine eight seven good thing you have a lot of
19176760	19187560	bonuses yes all right what's going on we're here well okay I am just gonna use
19187560	19198120	these like no but is it lovers because what do you do can be used as a any suit
19198120	19203520	it enhance the card into a golden one I'm just using it on random there's not
19203560	19211360	really a logic to it and you're you 20 now and a glass card I really don't like
19211360	19218000	the idea surely the first glass card I ever use will not actually destroy the
19218000	19228120	card well we added an artificial 10 so really we should destroy a 10 right I'll
19228120	19232240	do five twos and then if an attend shows up with added an artificial one that
19232240	19250160	doesn't oh let's see what we look for round one right King Queen Jack skip eight
19250160	19257760	nine that's a straight I'm gonna destroy the three right now so it doesn't matter
19257760	19266400	if it gets destroyed oh wow actually stayed oh I didn't understand what that
19266400	19270880	was gonna do like the nine chips three bucks if you get to keep it in your hand
19270880	19274580	though I wanted to keep this in my hand creates the planet card for the final
19274580	19287860	plate poker hand all around if held in hand play if held in hand
19287860	19302700	two pairs play and then we can upgrade sat and it was a net Saturn Saturn oh it's
19302700	19311020	Uranus shoot oh that's two pair multiplier though that's not bad at all yeah sure thank
19311020	19316700	you right what's this all card impacts are cheaper yes please let's redeem that
19316700	19325500	now so we can fire sale oh that's a good one hand size goes up by one if poker
19325500	19331500	hand is a straight flush no that's too rare even I've never done that but we're
19331500	19342180	tarot carded out the wazoo what we got increase ranked destroy convert I guess
19342180	19352620	increase rank and keep everything increase rank oh wait sorry I'll try and
19352620	19357540	push everything up on the other side of the board and then we can use two tarot
19357540	19364740	cards which again is gonna make this guy go out the wazoo Joker stone parts
19364740	19376740	planet our 16 bucks back I want to say planet yeah planet come on give me what
19376740	19387900	I need four of a kind sure and then airs full house sure right well got 16 bucks
19387900	19395420	Joker don't need stone don't want don't want right fit 16 boxes 16 bucks what we
19395420	19403860	are 24 multiplier it's going up we're not gonna oh we can't re-roll we're above
19403860	19411860	50 one re-roll I don't want to use it though
19412860	19417540	we're just gonna upgrade everything right one more one more re-roll
19417540	19426940	goodness goodness to pair yes okay next round we're at 50 we're at the top next
19426940	19433460	no we're cuz the economy is good we don't need it you know we don't need it I'd buy
19433460	19439740	the stars just above fortune teller I think I have to use it but I don't want
19439740	19443100	to oh wait does it make a difference if I shuffle decks it doesn't make a
19443100	19449620	difference I don't go for straight flushes all right we're gonna keep that
19449620	19455100	juicy tens sitting high and dry wait if I do I think I actually need to
19455100	19461460	purposely do two pairs two pair yes and then odd is gonna activate on the five
19461460	19468420	is Jack considered an odd I guess so I love straight that fine now to do right
19468420	19474020	if it okay so this gun yeah okay okay I'm happy with the two pairs let's go
19479220	19486020	lovely jubb leaving we love to see it right you get to stay in my hand so does
19486020	19491260	the 10 everything else honestly can be shoved out the window question mark
19491460	19499060	nothing else is complimenting so I could probably go for she's gorilla in nearly
19499060	19503740	one shot that yeah I can't believe them right so I'm gonna leave you on purpose
19503740	19508300	everything else I'm just gonna go for some sort of high double cuz my cards are
19508300	19516820	higher right you and wait maybe a single pair will do it shout out to all my
19516820	19527860	pairs a single pair might do it a single pair did it absolutely use mercury
19527860	19535420	holy crap that's two cars we got we got 16 bucks for that feels good man a
19535420	19544300	straight absolutely yes please celestial planet and turret but we're
19544300	19553220	gonna get both so it's not problem Saturn again oh feels freakin good man I
19553220	19561740	think we may actually win this choose one of the turret cards yet strength 16
19561740	19567140	bucks something into a gold card if you hold it you get money I don't really
19567140	19573980	need money like that and a glass part no I think just money again and real increase
19573980	19577060	the rank of a car
19580820	19591260	do I do it that increase these not money money money money money money money
19591260	19598500	strength strength on the twos okay strength on the twos let's do that we
19598500	19603020	still get a multiplayer up for doing it so we're gonna re-roll no we're not
19603060	19608420	we're too poor we're in 59 okay let's play it safe we're not gonna don't need
19608420	19612060	to re-roll anything else how are you doing you're six multiplier right now
19612060	19615860	so we're gonna try and get a few more twos and that's so cool on the eyes I
19615860	19619460	don't know how well it translates on stream but that's so cool on the eyes
19619460	19625540	that's exactly how it looks when you get like a card like that and really no I
19625540	19631540	don't need to skip 52 lose a dollar per card that's fine I do not mind the tooth
19631580	19641540	give me the tooth every round I'll take it right we could do two doubles again
19641540	19648140	and get this guy leveled up again further and I think that's probably the
19648140	19651500	wisest delayed gratification I don't know how much we're actually needing you
19651500	19656740	hang about now I'm gonna do two dubs I know I should probably can go for
19656740	19659900	straights because we're putting all our money into it but it looks pretty good
19659900	19665700	to me oh the card didn't break
19667700	19676300	um thank you I'll take it so now currently on 8 multi oh my god this is
19676300	19681860	so satisfying so satisfying like oh yeah it's all coming together you only care
19681860	19685140	about delayed gratification because it's a negative okay so it's not going
19685140	19695220	anywhere but and we just have one pair hanging out you know that we have four
19695220	19702180	rounds it's not really a big deal if we do like a lore thing like this on it the
19702180	19710860	singular pair the singular pair one is whoa oh my god and we got fricking to
19711140	19718580	yes use it now oh my god what are you enhance the steel card yes justice
19718580	19724340	enhance one selected and I got sure knock yourself out one planet card to use
19724340	19728660	come on give a Saturn baby oh close enough high card full house for the kind
19728660	19741660	I never get for a full house is three and two and and the two will compliment
19741660	19746540	pair I think airs earth is the best choice yes I agree with you sorry after I
19746540	19750540	did the effect after I did the math in my head I agree with you that that is the
19750540	19755580	best choice full house contains a pair isn't two and two better at this point
19755700	19761620	and I let's see let's see what it actually claims I wish I would do the
19761620	19766020	number math for me instead of giving me percentage like times I understand it
19766020	19775140	can't do it but a singular pair is 800 two pairs of 600 okay I need to remember
19775140	19781900	a singular pair truly is stronger but a straight is insanely strong four of a
19781900	19787900	kind honestly isn't lagging behind too much nor is the full house so who's
19787900	19797420	stronger a straight and then a pair not two pairs stop playing two pairs and we
19797420	19802060	don't need a new Joker Joker card and we're gonna use these right
19802060	19807380	eeps okay I lose a buck every time a player brown that's fine it doesn't
19808140	19812900	convert three cards into diamonds that doesn't make a difference because we're
19812900	19820460	not we're not doing suits or anything like that so it doesn't matter two pairs
19820460	19826460	add a permanent multiplier ah yes I forgot about that part go for straight
19826460	19833900	flush yeah two pairs just make a bunch of diamonds like a diamond in the sky right
19833940	19843900	so never on 27 enhances something into a steel card sure let's just make you a
19843900	19851420	steel car may steal the three sorry sorry alright steel three just say and
19851420	19859340	then a chance to destroy a car sure I'm just gonna use that wine now we are now
19859380	19867420	49 multi-pliers just getting juicy I'm here for it right just do a singular
19867420	19874220	pair a singular pair is stronger than a double kind of not quite nine eight

20141760	20154560	7 700 and then add 5 which makes it 840 so two pairs are now stronger close
20154560	20159440	enough close enough I know that the two pairs are stronger it's close enough

20230680	20234440	flush I'm just gonna buy these because I can I've got the money I've got the
20234440	20239240	disposable income please use your disposable income don't need a joker card
20239400	20246440	I didn't eat a reroll I said I need a reroll when small blind or big blind is
20246440	20266400	like to gain one more give me it okay I am satisfied steal that ten we rule
20266400	20288800	your jokers are perfect I don't want to skip the shop shit the odds of us getting
20288800	20294840	straights are very high if we increase our hand size by three but if we increase
20295000	20306160	if we skip the shop we might miss out on something big don't skip boss reroll what
20306160	20312120	what what have can I tell what it's gonna reroll into it just is very large blind
20312120	20322040	I assume there's no reroll in the final boss it's random it might make it worse
20322080	20330480	like if it turns around and says you can't play whatever no we're making sorry
20330480	20340600	we're making like 60,000 per hand I think I'm better playing and trying to get
20340600	20348000	another multiplier I think play to beat three you need to hit straights like
20348080	20352640	crazy reroll I am all then you have like six rerolls on the boss
20360160	20366400	my brain is telling me play this go to the shop I can upgrade I can play these two and upgrade
20366400	20372720	this by like 32 as well max procs thank you for coming a member during such a stressful time
20373360	20378320	we're gonna do it I think I'd risk the boss reroll as it stands you have to hit
20378320	20384320	straights every single and that's rough go with your boss normal number is much lower than
20384320	20401760	that runes or streaks fuck
20401760	20424640	cerulean bell means it's it's fine I won wait so does skip to have three more in my hand
20424640	20432640	and then I can play these like as I get in because it'll add to the multiplier yeah you can do it or
20432640	20448080	fuck oh fuck I'll show this right what's going on a wild card or do you do 10 queen okay I can't go
20448080	20456240	that way queen has to be played so what wild card a king and just do a double single king
20456240	20462480	oh wait no hold on two pair is stronger than a pair a flush is way stronger though
20464400	20471760	you can also just discard it or discard it has to be played or discarded wait hold on let the
20471760	20477760	reeflings think right let me just add a load of shit because this is going to add to our multiplier
20477760	20485600	enhance two selected cards to multi cards whoa that's actually really big 10% messing around
20487360	20492720	I can do well this turn it to a pair is not going to turn it to a pair
20493440	20502480	king king queen six six do you want king let me activate the lover's card on this
20503040	20510240	wait why do you know what enhance one selected card into a wild card why did that not work
20511600	20514480	wait oh wait it was going to do it to the queen
20515440	20521360	oh I mean it's going to put my multiplier up anyway
20524000	20526720	yeah so that didn't really do anything that's fine
20527680	20534880	your queen is forced to be selected empress will affect it okay we don't want that then so king king
20535440	20546320	nine nine because I've got an odd number king king nine nine double will activate spear trousers
20546320	20555120	odd will activate on the nine um nodders yeah yeah okay we've got agreements let's see what number

20873760	20883680	dollars as well right we're gonna do a reroll oh come on come on give it no right okay we're at 35
20883680	20895600	though wheel of fortune let's go no what we use it three times technically right one more reroll
20897040	20902560	what we got net chin one and two card to create a tarot when a booster pack is open
20903680	20909280	I've tried it three times create a tarot card if the poker hand contains an ace or a straight
20909280	20913040	brah we'd be tarotting out the wazoo but I don't know what I would give up for that
20913040	20917280	things about I mean hold on
20921120	20927840	hold on odd Todd in exchange for create a tarot card which is going to constantly bounce off
20927840	20936320	of fortune tellers cheeks huh it's something to consider
20941200	20947680	it's too late for polarity you think it's too late it's too late and an abstract one okay okay
20948640	20952560	I do not have enough for another reroll I want to maximize that income okay it's too late I will
20952560	20957760	okay thank you thank you thank you I am I am learning give us one dollar played hand I get 54
20957760	20966640	bucks for skipping this wait that's worth it then but it skips the shop but it's 54 bucks
20968400	20970960	playing a two pair sets money to zero
20974080	20976320	all face cards are drawn face down
20976400	20981920	yeah we definitely didn't oh no
20985360	20987360	is that a mistake possibly
20989760	20992720	54 bucks to skip but I need to buy stuff
20993440	20997280	polarity is cool when you delete your middle cards and just get tarts over hand
20998960	21005040	I think I'd do it for 54 bucks but we don't get access to the shop so if we mess up like this is it
21005600	21009360	strongy you're endless every round we'll get higher and higher until you break
21009360	21016800	until I break we're here to break the game if I get if I can mess around with 54 bucks so that's so big
21020080	21022720	enough fuck it
21024560	21030080	fuck it 103 have we even had 103 on our persons before
21030240	21035200	right face down face cards are drawn down
21037680	21039680	hmm
21041760	21045680	10 9 10 9 8 7 6 5
21051200	21053440	this will be a flush guaranteed but we will
21054240	21059040	subs we will forfeit a tarot card if I do it
21070000	21075200	not bad not bad oh this is getting a bit tricky though
21077200	21082480	so these are all high so really I'm just going for a double up here high
21084000	21087040	I don't really have a choice in the matter
21089200	21096560	I don't really want to I want to keep you yeah this is the best I can do considering discard
21096560	21104800	the face cards maybe dig for straights maybe just delete them it's just because we know they're high
21104800	21108960	so there's the odds are there's likely a singular pair in here
21109360	21119120	hmm but you're right though I could maybe get a straight low straight
21122240	21129120	how many how many rounds I've already done one fourth of it but I have four hands left if I
21129120	21135360	fuck this up it's just the likelihood of these being high or a pair is pretty decent
21136240	21144480	and oh shit wait maybe not no wait you guys are right holy shit you're right
21146960	21150000	10 9 8 7 6 5
21151920	21154880	yeah and then there'll be a multiplier because of what's on my hand
21155840	21160320	no that was the correct choice thank you guys thank you for letting me think a little bit there
21160320	21166080	uh ace
21170720	21175120	if there's not a queen in here we can't do a straight from here
21177440	21179040	we might be able to do a straight
21182960	21188960	or do we just play a singular ace what happens if it's a king
21190320	21195120	we don't make it what happens if it's a queen then we make it
21197120	21198800	it's a jack a queen or a king
21201280	21202800	you still have three hands
21205920	21213360	fuck it I'm here for the gamble we already won we already won so we can gamble like crazy
21214320	21220080	we already won so we can do these silly silly actions that no one should do at home
21220880	21226960	uh well a double four clear it I think it will yeah a double four will clear it no problem
21229760	21233280	oh I fish my smart smart smart fish smart fish
21235680	21238160	16 bucks the money's getting lesser
21238400	21241760	oh don't mind if I do
21244560	21249920	uh urinus also levels up what's this permanently add a discard for each one
21250480	21254560	it's pretty good I'll add a permanent discount
21255360	21260240	because that'll help out I've got a voucher unlocked even more I must be like steam sale
21260240	21265680	tarot cards let's go I'm over 100 gold I'm just that good right
21266240	21273680	planet glass stone planet planet no doubt four of a kind and a high card I mean
21277200	21282960	I'm just level everything up high card a joker card I don't need so we're gonna do a re-roll
21284560	21290320	a full house and a flush sure I'm quite happy there are only two dollars as well to buy like

21420720	21425280	stream slightly late for it don't worry about it guys and we are about to redirect into none other
21425280	21434400	than a Zeridule who is doing ASMR so please do enjoy her uh to your full capacity straight flush
21434400	21440080	I don't want to go straight flushed off me little all right we can do one more
21444240	21454960	uh yes and yes to use well because we will utilize you okay next round
21457120	21461920	let's go all right what do you do select two cards give out the left card into the right
21462880	21466960	I would like to actually upgrade our doubles
21474160	21477360	because we're not really doing it
21482640	21483200	oh no
21486400	21489680	that may have been a mistake I'm gonna be honest that may have been a mistake
21490560	21493600	queen jack 10 no I don't have to flush at all
21496000	21504240	ooh I might mess up there make another steal ooh I like that idea select two cards that convert
21504240	21516880	the left card into the right one so two steals okay now I have to get riddles
21519760	21527120	I couldn't theory if we're going for a flush get rid of the jewel jack because we can jump over him
21527840	21528800	and vice versa
21531760	21537520	uh we can jump over the jack at any point so he's not really necessarily needed
21540240	21544720	or I could just get a steel jack you know your choice
21544720	21551360	oh no this is oh no this can't be I'm doing shit
21557360	21562720	wait am I a freaking idiot can I not jump allow straights to be made with gaps in one rank yeah
21562720	21569120	so I can still do the jump ace marison yes I'm about to lose this round I'm not even joking and I
21569120	21574640	I don't have any shred of hope I've completely balls this up and yeah I can still jump
21576000	21579120	yeah I knew I could still jump I've got a shortcut and 10
21584480	21586800	losing not good no not good at all but
21589120	21593920	we'll survive ish I don't even know what to play
21593920	21600320	hey the multiplier is so good but I have like nothing I can play
21602400	21605680	king queen 10 and then nothing
21607760	21617120	oh what do I do what do you recommend discard and fish for something better I'm gonna have to
21617840	21619360	right queen I can discard
21622000	21626800	I don't want to discard like these guys because they all give me a multiplier
21628240	21632560	oh but I'm gonna have to wait that plays a pair apparently oh yeah it does
21634800	21640560	I mean I only have four I can't throw it away
21642000	21644880	well I can't throw away that's what I'm gonna do I need to go for a flush
21644880	21646880	oh
21651760	21655120	king queen jack 10 9 8 oh
21658240	21663840	all right we're gonna have to just go for double vase 2 9
21664560	21664960	I mean
21669440	21675120	my luck is perishing guys I've used all my luck the game really said go redirect into
21675120	21681040	a zero right now I mean it's not too bad you're right it's not too bad let's give a shot what's
21681040	21681680	going on here
21685040	21686000	no I've not got it
21686240	21695760	I mean I can do a full house here but I've not got it
21699280	21705040	oh I think it's ogre won't be a lose if you redirect or should I just redirect
21705040	21707600	and end the stream and be like oh I won by the way wink wink
21710240	21712960	this scaling and endless most is insane
21713920	21716400	ah well we'll just play what we've got I know
21719920	21725760	yeah now we've already lost the first endless holy crap right six five four three and I can't
21725760	21732880	do anything wow that got like hard out in nowhere like so hard right we're just gonna
21732880	21738800	we're not gonna win so there's no point in like trying to freaking go nuts with the math behind
21738800	21746480	the game we don't have it right king jack 10 9 8 okay well don't have an 8 so we'll roll for an 8
21751760	21760960	we'll roll for an 8 yeah king jack 10 9 8 that's the best we can do with both clubs
21761520	21769440	no biggie we tried we tried our besties that wasn't bad that got insanely hard though like
21769440	21774480	instantly insanely hard I am very interested in trying to win with all the other decks though
21776880	21782880	pardon me sorry oh we unlocked a few things when I run without playing four of a kind oops
21784960	21789920	well considering I didn't get it why would you give me that as a card when I run without playing a
21789920	21797280	flush I mean that's really not that hard and then when I run copies the ability of the joker to the
21797280	21806320	right oh that would be a very interesting card nebula deck unlocked when um start run with the
21806320	21815120	telescope voucher and one consumable slot tell celestial pack always contain a planet card for
21815120	21823840	your most played poker hand wow that's an interesting element redeem at least 10 voucher cards in one
21823840	21830000	run all cards and packs are 50 off I thought that when I saw that I popped up on the side
21830000	21841840	um planet cards in your consumable area give 1.5 multi for this one
21843920	21848480	use a total of 25 planet cards from any pack I use 33 in that run flow
21850560	21858160	use a total of 25 tarot cards from any arena spectral cards may appear in any of the oh so
21858160	21865200	it's like bonus cards now I like that I love games that like level up and get easier or unlock more
21865200	21870320	unique stuff as time goes on like that's why I really like binding of Isaac three times multi on
21870320	21881920	final hand of a round play 200 hands well there it is balatro not to be diffused with more pro
21882880	21892560	and okay okay let's make sure that Azura Dooley is online and then I will very quickly swap my

22208560	22212880	franchise called oh my god we're claptrap and everything borderlands moxie borderlands
22213760	22223680	I preferred moxie's borderlands what design was it moxie borderlands three design question mark

22229440	22233040	I honestly wouldn't mind a cute hat on someone
22235040	22239040	I'm down for a cute hat on someone I don't know who but someone
22240720	22245200	my delay is bad enough I watched the whole video before she mentioned it in the video oh no
22247280	22252240	I don't know why some of my streams have been on lowly uh on high normal latency and I've had to
22252240	22255040	manually put it back to low latency so there isn't a delay
22258000	22264160	right now I'm playing borderlands three I'm gonna uh for my birthday in October
22265040	22269280	I'm gonna see if I can wrangle some v-tubers to play borderlands two campaign with me
22270000	22278320	uh I'd like to do that for me birthday um problem is endurance streamers although saying that she
22278320	22283040	be done an endurance stream and so has Azura um
22286720	22291440	uh I might have made a new a new friend a new um
22294080	22297920	what do you call it when it's a professional relationship like because we both work in the
22297920	22304400	same job is that the terminology I may have made a new thingy it might be interesting possibly I
22304400	22310800	could grab one chick from a v-tuber agency in different agencies and do a borderlands thing
22310800	22316560	and it'll be like a four-way agency collab oh wow but you know only with people I vibe with because
22316560	22322400	yeah uh business part yeah business relationship yeah that's pretty much my man and
22324160	22328960	my main fact in the girls are endurance streaming we are so back literally I was so surprised Azura
22328960	22338240	did like insane on a stardew valley apparently she has like thousands of hours in it and I'm like
22340240	22346880	the game I have the most hours in is black ops one and then black ops two and then probably
22346880	22354240	overwatch and then dead by daylight and then it just kind of gets scattered around the place from
22354800	22360960	the 4k on stardew is she like a hundred percent of that stuff I think Isaac has most I think I
22360960	22367840	uh I cleared like I think I'm just shy of 500 hours in Isaac how many hours in dead by daylight
22367840	22375840	I was a very early player of dead by daylight I've probably got 1.5 thousand hours in dead by
22375840	22380880	daylight I was an early dead by daylight player I am not familiar with anything do not ask me the
22380960	22388320	question of anything uh in the recent updates I was gone a long time ago in that game um
22390160	22397600	wait did I say the number right yeah I probably got like 4,000 in cards and then overwatch would be
22397600	22407760	like 2,000 dead by daylight 1,000.5 like oh when I get into a game I get into a game like I'm only
22407760	22412320	at 700 just watch vods in two times speed yeah that's how you keep up with my content I was like
22412320	22417760	how am I supposed to keep up with your content if Azura has done a stardew stream into the 12 hour
22417760	22423440	mark of the day she she would actually have you beaten off well if youtube would fix their
22423440	22432480	vod issue then I'd be streaming a heck of a lot longer 4k and black ops one uh yeah most likely
22432480	22441280	on that one alone um I was very isolated as a child and played black ops one all day long
22441920	22448640	and I was having problems like going to school and all that had issues oh boo I'm gonna eat my
22448640	22453680	my protein ball so my stomach isn't rumbling too much during the ASMR um
22455840	22460960	2k and rims world ooh what's your guys' biggest game I have a next two weeks off of vacation
22460960	22463920	might be able to catch up with Tony's vods by then good luck
22468400	22472720	pretty strong you feel hot oh well we're in the good times now we flin don't worry about
22474080	22480800	yeah I'm basically used to sit and play xbox all day because um my parents were like super
22480800	22489040	understanding with the whole school situation um and having issues so I just kind of got left
22489440	22499360	to my xbox and that's why I play a lot of xbox games dominions what's dominions five dominions
22499360	22504640	five I haven't even heard of dominions one what kind of underground games are you guys playing

22517600	22524160	this protein peanut butter ball is shit I cast mend but crack it's that bad
22525520	22529040	probably dead by daylight with 3000 black ops mentioned one on five
22531760	22532800	oh no that's not one with five
22533760	22535600	do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
22535600	22539280	not one 7k and destiny
22540880	22547840	yeah damn did you play kod zombie no I was terrified of kod zombies I still am I find it terrifying
22549760	22558560	I wish there was an end the reason why I thoroughly enjoyed college or a ghost alien mode is because
22558560	22563660	there was an end you can you can either win the game mode or you can die to the
22563660	22568360	aliens in the game mode which is why I adored it had an end games that are like
22568360	22572720	infinite replayability but doesn't give you some sort of closure or ending I
22572720	22578040	didn't like it so when like cod zombies keeps going that's not really for me
22578040	22583600	although I'm sure there's a new zombie game out that's supposed to rival cod
22583600	22591040	zombies kind of game mode completely forgotten the name of the game though
22591040	22596360	20k hours in world of warcraft yeah damn your ERP and in Goldshire a little
22596360	22602680	too much are you not I moved from game to game a lot 500 is probably on the
22602680	22611760	highest an elite elite sniper oh I wouldn't mind playing warhammer 2 I want
22611760	22615720	to see if there's any v-tubers that play warhammer 2 if it's the game I'm
22615720	22621320	thinking about and I used to play the healer in it and heal and you give
22621320	22625760	everyone heels and you go yeah that's me because it was like you use your voice
22625760	22635720	to heal everyone for me it's path of exile 3 hours high pixel sky block you
