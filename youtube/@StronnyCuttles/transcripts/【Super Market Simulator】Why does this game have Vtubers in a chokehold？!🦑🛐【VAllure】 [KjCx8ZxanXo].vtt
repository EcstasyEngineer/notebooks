you've got with book on microchips and I was the only reason I reject that lore

08:19.980 --> 08:26.020
is because I am tinfoil huh I'm trying to put audio was amazing need to know

08:26.020 --> 08:32.300

08:36.900 --> 08:42.900
the sensor honestly I wasn't able to participate in yesterday's educational

08:42.900 --> 08:47.900
stream what did you miss you missed a prototype for streamings that I might do

08:47.900 --> 08:52.540
in the future and there was a surprise pop quiz at the end but I gave you a hint

08:52.540 --> 08:55.980
that there was a quiz at the end because at the start I said write your name at

08:55.980 --> 09:00.340
the top of the paper and I actually had some reeflings genuinely like write down

09:00.340 --> 09:03.740

09:08.420 --> 09:13.300
good everything cool when you're part of the team you missed the biology

09:13.300 --> 09:18.260
sociology exam and then a random lore dump about how the production of the

09:18.260 --> 09:21.620
Hobbit was an absolute nightmare and I won't accept any Hobbit slander and

09:21.620 --> 09:29.380
Toriel as well and all that I'm almost finished my tea I made a shit tea today

09:29.380 --> 09:35.260

09:35.260 --> 09:45.740
right so supermarket simulator apparently it's early access I don't know and I've

09:45.740 --> 09:48.980

welcome good morning thank you for your custom thank you for supporting a

40:37.200 --> 40:45.040
local business instead of a conglomerate of a monopoly yes thank you I'm just a

40:45.040 --> 40:52.120
little guy I pay taxes did you know that when you're fucking when you know when

40:52.120 --> 40:58.160
supermarkets prompt you to donate don't ever do it they claim that as their

40:58.160 --> 41:02.440
taxes because they get a tax rebate on a donation and they put it against the

41:02.440 --> 41:08.040
taxes they should be paying but because they're a freaking conglomerate thank you

41:08.040 --> 41:12.080
for supporting a small business do appreciate you oh oh big order thank

41:12.120 --> 41:17.400
you what do you need $5 change there is that was our biggest sale yet thank you

41:17.400 --> 41:22.400
paying taxes and my strongy stream this man loves this cereal donations are

41:22.400 --> 41:30.080
tax loopholes so whenever fast food joint that is massive or a supermarket

41:30.080 --> 41:35.480
that is massive goes would you like to donate to the starving children no but

41:35.480 --> 41:39.600
not for that reason okay you're allowed to donate in general but not via the

41:39.600 --> 41:46.120
supermarket because they use it as a freaking tax rebate okay so don't don't

41:46.120 --> 41:51.320
support via the supermarket if you want to support in general that's fine but

41:51.320 --> 41:55.400
say now let them kids starve they're literally guilt-tripping you let them

41:55.400 --> 42:04.680
motherfuckers yes if you really wanted to donate to directly to charity but the

42:04.680 --> 42:07.760
biggest way I think the biggest way you can help out the community is

42:07.760 --> 42:14.920

Products not found!

45:17.580 --> 45:24.300
How... what am I... am I playing this game wrong? I'm getting... I'm getting... I'm getting nervous.

45:24.300 --> 45:28.780
Why is everything going horrifically wrong? Where everyone's getting the shot right now.

45:28.780 --> 45:33.820
How much is a fridge? Furnit your... shelves?

45:34.540 --> 45:39.420
A display fridge? A fridge single. Another $200?

45:40.540 --> 45:44.060
Oh that's quite a tall order, sorry. But like, look at my... how...

45:45.020 --> 45:49.900
I'm to get a fridge on flour alone. Good morning. Please tell me you don't want anything out of the...

45:50.700 --> 45:54.940
Okay, that's fine. You're allowed pasta. I... I give you permission to have pasta.

45:56.620 --> 45:58.940
Thank you for your custom. Here's a dollar change.

45:58.940 --> 46:06.940
I don't sell cheese! There's no indication of cheese being sold in the shop.

46:07.980 --> 46:14.060
You're not allowed to ask for products, ma'am, that we don't sell. Miss, get back here. I will fistfight

46:14.060 --> 46:19.500
you in the back in the parking lot. Get back here. We don't sell cheese. There's no indication we

46:19.500 --> 46:23.980
should be selling cheese. Do you know what my license is? Are you the person I bought the

46:23.980 --> 46:31.180
freaking license from? Relax. It's not that serious. It honestly isn't. Oh, I can't even find the cheese.

46:31.180 --> 46:35.420
Yeah, nay, shite. There's nay fucking fridges. Of course there's nay cheese. Do you know how hot

46:35.420 --> 46:38.780
it is outside? Like, honestly, the whole world doesn't revolve around you, ma'am.

46:40.300 --> 46:45.260
Strong behavior. I didn't know... I didn't know they were allowed to be demanding, like,

46:45.260 --> 46:48.700
oh, but she could sell cheese. Now, it'd be different if they were like, oh, I can't wait

46:48.780 --> 46:55.180
for you to expand to sell cheese, but oh, there's nay cheese. Of course there's nay cheese. Are you

46:55.180 --> 47:00.940
gonna pay for the fridge? It's 200 quid. I've not got 200 quid via flour sales unless you want to,

47:00.940 --> 47:05.660
like, open up a bakery and use me as your supply chain. Sure, you can complain then,

47:05.660 --> 47:11.740
but are you freaking kidding me? Like, honestly, that absolute cheek of some folk.

47:13.420 --> 47:17.980
Good afternoon, sir. Sorry about that outburst. I was just talking to my co-worker on the headset.

47:17.980 --> 47:24.940
I promise I wasn't having a random mental health breakout burst. Right, we are gonna need more

47:24.940 --> 47:31.020
products. Just shove anything in here. Right, we can't sell cheese because everything needs water.

47:31.020 --> 47:42.060
Eh, I need a shelf apparently. No, not right now! Okay. Could you imagine a customer and we're just

47:42.060 --> 47:48.620
going, you can take your money back by right-clicking on the bills on the cash register. Oh, did I make

47:48.620 --> 47:55.340
a mistake? I don't know. Change a dollar. Did I make a mistake? Couldn't find the sliced bread.

47:55.340 --> 48:04.620
Yeah, because I don't sell it! Jeez. Jeez, you guys are like so needy, honestly. Right, bread?

48:05.420 --> 48:13.260
You want bread? What, you want cereal? Cereal's $41? Oh my lord, I don't have that kind of money.

48:15.740 --> 48:22.140
Oh my god, I need to hire someone else to do the machines, honestly. Insufficient change.

48:23.260 --> 48:31.660
How do I put it back? Put it back. Put it back. Close checkout, approve. Back. How do I put it back? Oh no.

48:32.620 --> 48:41.340
What? What do you need? Giving $7? Right, hold on. Let me do it like this. Sorry, sorry. Hold on.

48:41.340 --> 48:46.860
Bink, won't bink. Okay, sorry. I hadn't. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Couldn't find the milk. Fond de la bosom.

48:49.020 --> 48:54.300
Tomato tomato. Just, just enjoy the stock for what it's worth, honestly. I ain't got time. I don't have

48:54.300 --> 48:59.500
time. I need to hire someone else to do this. Reflens, will you come work in a convenience store

48:59.500 --> 49:04.540
with me? I need your help. I don't have time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The cheese. Why is

49:04.540 --> 49:09.580
everyone addicted to cheese? I thought you were all lactose intolerant by like 50% of the nation

49:09.580 --> 49:15.820
become, who knocked over my packages? I thought everyone becomes lactose intolerant like so quickly.

49:15.820 --> 49:20.860
Okay, drop. Just shove it on the floor. Good afternoon. Hello, thank you for your custom.

49:20.860 --> 49:25.820
You would like $2 change. Oh, here it is. Thank you, veiler lover for the extended membership. Just

49:25.820 --> 49:32.140

49:32.140 --> 49:38.860
for the next audio and then it's me with a dick. Oh, everyone was like absolutely like, oh, so

49:38.860 --> 49:44.780
disappointed. Oh, thank you for the exact change, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Who is knocking over

49:44.780 --> 49:54.700
my packages? Please don't do that. Can I restock? No, I put it on the bottom shelf. I suck. No,

49:54.780 --> 49:59.260
I'm not ready yet. I'm not ready yet. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Gee, shove

49:59.260 --> 50:07.740
on the floor. Hello. Good afternoon. Bing, bing, bing. All yours. All yours, baby. I'm restocking

50:07.740 --> 50:13.500
whilst on the job. I'm actually so good at this. Sorry. I'm such a good multitasker. Did you know

50:13.500 --> 50:18.700
that it is a common misconception that women can multitask more, but actually it's just practice

50:18.700 --> 50:23.740
behavior because yeah, you can't, I don't sell tea. I didn't know they could be so cheeky and ask

50:23.740 --> 50:28.620
for stuff I didn't even sell, honestly. I've got nothing but the cheek you lot do, honestly,

50:28.620 --> 50:32.540
honestly, honestly. I'm on to you. I'm on to you. Didn't think I'm on to you. Sorry, I need to clean

50:32.540 --> 50:37.100
up the storage. Excuse me, sir. Sorry, just a moment. Just a moment. Can you run in this game?

50:37.100 --> 50:41.100
That'd be really helpful. Don't ding that bell. Don't ding the bell on the register. I'm just

50:41.100 --> 50:48.540
about to be there. Please give me a second. Thank you. Buy a boh here. I bet him buy a boh here.

50:48.540 --> 50:52.540
I know you couldn't find the bottled water because it's in a package that you'll never know about.

50:54.140 --> 50:54.460
No.

50:59.580 --> 51:06.780
I'm just buying everything. Okay. I'm here and the lights are getting Friday nights and the lights

51:06.780 --> 51:16.300
are low. Hold on. I need to put the lights on. It's so dark, my lady. That audio is not my cup

51:16.300 --> 51:21.260
of tea, but I'm still gonna listen to it. Are you even though you don't like it? Thank you.

51:21.900 --> 51:26.780
It's not for everyone. It's not for everyone, but I do have some outrageous

51:26.780 --> 51:31.660
audios coming out soon. Thank you, Broly Legend for the tip and for giving it a shot. I mean,

51:31.660 --> 51:35.980
some people are like, so they're like, I would never listen to this. It's disgusting. I'm like,

51:35.980 --> 51:40.780
bro, relax. I'm literally pretending to have a willy. It's not that serious.

51:42.780 --> 51:47.260
What do you mean you don't want me to clap your cheeks? If reeflings come work for you,

51:47.420 --> 51:52.460
you require good benefits. You can't provide those right? Winking face.

51:53.420 --> 51:59.740
What kinds of benefits would you like anonymous is the question? I mean, there's not as long as

51:59.740 --> 52:08.140
you don't report it to HR. There's not much that I'm not happy with, you know? $9, $5, 1, 1, 1, 1. Boom.

52:09.660 --> 52:15.580
If I read cheese one more time, I'm gonna shove cheese up someone's arse.

52:17.420 --> 52:21.340
Let's just very quickly purchase all this shit and then I can put it on the shelves.

52:23.660 --> 52:27.660
Oh, no, let's stay open because there's a customer. Open.

52:30.300 --> 52:33.580
I was anything but disappointed with the latest audio,

52:33.580 --> 52:39.740
Mama. In fact, I was elated that I had the house to myself so I could use my new figureine to it.

52:40.300 --> 52:43.660
No. My figureine died, though, and I have to try again another day.

52:44.380 --> 52:44.860
No.

52:47.820 --> 52:49.020
Your figure died?

52:49.020 --> 52:55.900
I would love to work in your store, Mama. I'll handle the heavy packages as long as you handle my heavy package.

52:56.620 --> 53:00.860
You don't even have to pay me. I just want to ogle at my little seed.

53:02.220 --> 53:05.820
Okay, that was actually really good. I'll give you that. That was really good.

53:06.780 --> 53:10.780
God, some late night shoppers, huh? Burning the midday oil. Go home.

53:11.980 --> 53:20.700
Jeez. Oh my. What? How? It must be because they're spawning around the corner.

53:22.300 --> 53:26.620
Jeez, you guys don't love your families? My goodness. Thank you so much. Anonymous.

53:27.900 --> 53:33.580
I have really weak wrists and hands, so unironically, I will take that help. I'm so freaking weak.

53:33.660 --> 53:38.780
I'm a weakling, okay? I'm a weakling. A weak little seaweed. It's shocking behavior.

53:40.540 --> 53:45.180
The Rizzler. Thank you. Orvon Biscuit as well. How did it die is my question.

53:47.340 --> 53:56.300
And what? How did it die? It's got a... Not that word. It's got a battery in it. Is that my question?

53:57.260 --> 54:05.180
What was that meme that it's like, oh, so a woman can have a d-d-d-d-d-9000, but if I have a d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-x

54:05.180 --> 54:11.180
elemental pee, I'm the weird one. What is that meme that has just reminded me of that meme? I can't

54:11.180 --> 54:15.500
remember it though. Family who sent them to the corner. Oh my god, my mom used to send me the

54:15.500 --> 54:19.740
corner shop to get cigarettes all the time. Actually, I will say one thing about the Belgians.

54:20.460 --> 54:25.500
You guys are so nice, because I didn't have my ID in this Belgian lady. Let me buy cigarettes.

54:25.500 --> 54:29.020
And she was like, you look too young. And I'm like, hee hee, but I'm from Scotland though.

54:30.300 --> 54:33.180
I was like, I'm from Scotland, so no one's going to get you in trouble.

54:33.820 --> 54:37.740
And like, I literally started speaking to her and I was like, yeah, I don't speak Dutch. I'm not

54:37.740 --> 54:47.660
from here. I literally just need cigarettes. Smile. Thank you, Maycule, for becoming a member. I

54:47.660 --> 54:54.060
appreciate it. I'm sorry for butchering your name. Please forgive me. Right, tomorrow we can purchase

54:54.060 --> 54:59.900
the fridge. So our beloved package of, that's just, that's being chilling in the corner. Right,

54:59.900 --> 55:05.340
we can have cheese tomorrow. Okay, let's go to bed. Oh wait, no, do we have bills?

55:07.180 --> 55:15.820
Alone? No, we're not taking out a loan. We hate the banks. Oh my god, 67 cents. Wait, every day

55:15.820 --> 55:24.700
it's gonna cost me 20 bucks. Judy, that's rough. I don't make 70 bucks on every purchase. Right,

55:24.700 --> 55:33.820
new name, new date. Stop, I'm getting ready to write that plot. Stop, you're getting me ready

55:33.820 --> 55:37.740
to write that plot. Oh, don't think I won't do it. Don't think I won't write that plot. That's

55:37.740 --> 55:41.740
absolutely hilarious. Oh, I like a little guard as well. I don't even notice I've got a little guard

55:41.740 --> 55:47.900
to protect me from the customers from this side. I will literally thank you for the tip and honest.

55:47.900 --> 55:52.940
I will write that. Please don't think I won. I'm literally, I love like freaking plots that we do

55:52.940 --> 55:58.540
together. It's my favorite thing. This woman truly will do it. Do it, you won't know boss. Shake bag

55:58.540 --> 56:06.060
if you didn't. Shake bag if you didn't. Don't throw it at us with a good time. Hello, any customers?

56:06.060 --> 56:13.420
Are you my first customer? Actually, I've never even, we must be in New York because those things

56:13.420 --> 56:19.580
like the fire exit things always look like they're from New York. Oh, we have a customer. Are you

56:19.580 --> 56:27.820
squidding me right now? Hi, mama. I just tuned in. I just wanted to say you stole my heart during

56:27.820 --> 56:34.060
yesterday's stream when you read my morrow before you logged off. Turning on your hypno eyes and

56:34.060 --> 56:39.580
talking about control was so unbelievably hot. Now I really want to ink in your clown.

56:41.980 --> 56:45.180
I mean, I can make something like that. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, honestly, I can.

56:45.180 --> 56:50.780
Don't think I won. Yes, it had a battery. I thought it would work better than the unpowered ones I

56:50.780 --> 56:55.420
tried in the past, but didn't find enjoyable using them by myself. Oh, we're getting a live review.

56:55.420 --> 56:58.300
I need mommy's help to enjoy my cheeks being clapped.

57:00.220 --> 57:02.940
That is terrible. Amazing. Thank you.

57:07.340 --> 57:10.300
Oh, thank you for the tip anonymous and out of on biscuit.

57:12.060 --> 57:18.540
No, so obviously, I can't really make anything and I can't record new ASMR until my dad goes away,

57:18.540 --> 57:22.540
but he goes away next week. I'm actually going to be so depressed. So don't be surprised when I

57:23.340 --> 57:27.180
when I stream and for like 12 hours, and then I'm like, I don't want to go offline because

57:27.180 --> 57:31.420
I don't want to be sad in my emotions the moment I go offline because like I'm never sad when I'm

57:31.420 --> 57:37.820
like streaming to you. And like I'm always happy like just like having the time of my life. So I

57:37.820 --> 57:42.300
just know I'm going to be so depressed, but I'm happy on stream. But as soon as I end stream,

57:42.300 --> 57:48.300
like it's literally going to be that meme where it's like with the music, like I'm not going to

57:48.860 --> 57:52.860
I'm not going to be having a good time next week, but you guys will make it that have a good time.

57:54.140 --> 57:59.100
And you know, I know you guys will make a good time. So I need just as needed as we fling.

57:59.900 --> 58:03.420
I mean, I think that's why we work so well together. We fling. I mean,

58:03.420 --> 58:08.140
you know, you don't report me to HR. We do some things in the break room, you know,

58:09.020 --> 58:13.740
I don't report you for something, something, something, something, something.

58:14.300 --> 58:18.700
I am happy to help you in the shop. And as payment all I ask is that you give me some

58:18.700 --> 58:23.980
cream like you did in the recent order. Honestly, do you want some creamer for your

58:23.980 --> 58:29.980
coffee in the morning at my supermarket? We'll call it. What would we call it? Oh, you can't rename

58:29.980 --> 58:39.660
it. Oh, I thought what is city gates? City gates. Um, I what would we name the shop though? If we

58:39.660 --> 58:47.180
had one. Squid ink. A dollar for you, madam. Thank you for your custom. Right. We're at 100

58:47.180 --> 58:53.900
bucks. We just need a few more sales, please. Squirts. You want, you want this supermarket

58:53.900 --> 59:05.020
to be called squirts? Oh no, this can't be. You can see ink. Coldstone creamery. I'm not sure

59:05.020 --> 59:11.820
we're going to get a wave. Although, can we make one of those cringy American ads? Jones, barbecue

59:11.820 --> 59:19.260
foot massage. And then our version is like, uh, Strone and Reflings, Inc. Emporium or something

59:19.260 --> 59:26.700
like that. I don't know what we'd call it. Ink mark. Well, like ink mark. Strone and Reflings,

59:26.700 --> 59:34.380
ink mark. Come on down to get your things. Come on down to get your things. We're anti-capitalist,

59:34.380 --> 59:39.980
but we still have to participate in society. But it's okay because our prices are lower than

59:39.980 --> 59:49.740
the monopolies. That's our theme song. It's like the worst jingle you could imagine. And everyone's

59:49.740 --> 59:59.500
like, why did they put ads into this? This is awful. Honestly. Thank you. Oil, oil, oil. I know

59:59.580 --> 01:00:05.660
you Americans like your oil. Take it. Take all my oil. Right, $137. We're almost there. Thank you

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:15.820
for your purchases. $17. Oh, nope. I almost messed up so bad. Sir, you have no idea how much I

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:20.540
about overcharged you. You're so welcome. I was on it. Are you squidding me right now? You charged

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:27.020
him $0.09? Hi, Mama. I remembered you once said that Reflings are able to hypno you just like

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:33.340
you can hypno us. Yes. Can you teach us how? A mind broken straw knee would be amazing to see,

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:39.020
to see our cheeky little less get addicted to Reflings ink. I'm already addicted to,

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.460
you only send a man of marshmallows. I demand marshmallows.

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:52.460
So technically you can hypnotize me at any time, but in my head, I've done it that you prefer to do

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:58.300
it via a mirror because you like when I do it to myself, like it's more satisfying for you

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:02.460
that way. I'm not going to run out of freaking things. Thank you for the hypno.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:09.580
Top tier servicing. No matter how big or small, we work until you're satisfied.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.020
And I don't think the work is talking about the average nine of five.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:26.780
Call it ink and drink. Thank you. Lars the dude for the tip. Yeah, I'm not convinced you're talking

01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.900
about the average nine to five work. I think we're talking about another kind of work. You know what

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:44.860
I'm saying? How's the weather in Australia? Are you okay Reflings? Did you get a little

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:51.900
nervous typing that out? Thank you for letting me pop your super cherry. Oh, no, no, you're,

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.900
I said that wrong. I said that wrong. Sorry. Other me. Thank you for letting me pop your

01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:01.740
super cherry. No, you're super cherry. I'm so sorry. That sounded like an insult. I didn't mean

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:16.060
it like that. It's winter. So it's cold. It's cold. Okay, eight dollars. Did that charge anything

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:19.660
for that? Did I just let you walk out for free? I think I did. I think I messed that up.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:28.140
Your mega chair, your super mega cherry is main boy. You're not getting away from me that easily.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:37.420
Right. Okay, we're done. We can buy a fridge. I assume I can buy a fridge or do I need to do it in

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:45.020
the morning? Here is the fridge. A mini fridge. Okay. Oh crap. I have to do it in the morning.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:50.220
We'll also add a product into it. What are we missing?

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:59.100
Oh my God, please. You're welcome to buy anything you like. Buy everything. Yes, yes. Okay, I'll

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:04.140
take it. Three items are better than one. You know what I'm saying? Thank you for your custom. I

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:11.340
couldn't find sushi, even cheese. How come you didn't mention that you can speak French? Because I

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:18.140
can't. I can say like one or two sentences and I can throw stuff together. It's pretty much it.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:25.660
I can't actually speak French. I can say like, oh, je voudrais, you know, tabit. I can ask for

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:33.180
your cock. I can ask for your horse in French. To say butt in French, you say cool. Thank you,

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.860
dindle shit, 500. What a name for the super chat, by the way. You're super chat cherry.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:43.420
Yeah, to say your butt, you say mon cul. Are you squiddling me right now?

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:50.620
So, Strani, if we already have the capability to hypno you, does that mean we can turn on mind

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:56.540
broken Strani whenever we want? Do we snap our fingers? Say a certain phrase?

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:02.860
Um, so if you've ever looked, ah, you know what? I'll show you. This is my loading screen. Look at

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.860
you in the loading screen. Oh wait, this is my ending screen. I know you can still hear me in this,

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:16.380
but yeah, you can. See how you're on my head right now in here? Wait for it. Wait for it.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:26.140
Look at you. Look at you on the top of my head. Ready, steady. We both have hypnosis.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:32.860
Look, you have the hair thing like I do. Yeah, you got the little hair thing,

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:39.580
little hypnotic thing. Yeah, it's real. That's you. You can do that to me and I can do it to you.

01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:44.620
I forgot which gaming thing I was on. Like I'm on this one. Oh, where's my game?

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:54.060
Well, we're not doing that again. That was scary, please. That scared me. Right,

01:04:54.060 --> 01:05:00.140
we've got a fridge and we've got 13 bucks so we can order bread and then tomorrow we can purchase it.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:06.540
Okay, and it's only $2 for delivery. That's fantastic. Closed. New day. New day. Right,

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:12.540
we're going to very quick. Products found expensive, so is, but no from the, not from around here,

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:21.580
partner, not from around here. Right, hold on. Give me the fridge right now. It's a fridge. Oh my

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:33.580
head, rotate with mouse wheel. Okay, can I slot you right here? Oh my god. Display is full. Wait,

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:41.420
the fridge is tiny. She said she was 12. Sorry, I said it like that. Hold on. Open. No, draft.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:47.740
Some products went down in price but you didn't follow. How dare they? They're making,

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.580
they're making a mockery of me. They're making a mockery. Right, I only have two dollars. Right,

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:58.140
let's set a price for the water. Water. Market price is $2.13, so we'll do two bucks. What are you?

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:04.700
We need to lower the oil. Of course, I invest in tons of oil in the games like, yeah, we're

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:09.180
going to just artificially lower the price. Right, bread's up at four bucks. Yeah, nine.

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:15.180
What's flour? Okay, flour's fine. Flour's fine, don't worry about it. Okay, hydration check,

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:26.940
reeflings. Hydration check. Hydration.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:41.340
I'm gonna burp okay. Open your mouth, reefling. Open wide. All yours, baby. Good boy for opening

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:46.860
your mouth. It's fucking disgusting. That's actually disgusting. You know what, you know what

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:51.500
the worst part is when I do something like that, like a gag like that? Oh, hit me on one.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:56.460
Hi, I'm a first-time customer for this establishment and I was wondering if you

01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:02.380
sold any exotic items. Maybe a dog, collar, and bowl. Sound familiar, Stronny?

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:10.300
Okay, if you didn't know, I may or may not have an alternative Twitter account, okay,

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:18.460
and I may or may not have purchased a collar. Oh, give me that back. Oh, you know what,

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:25.500
fuck it, you can have it for free. Thanks for your custom. I may or may not have bought a dog

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.660
bowl and a dog collar with your name on it because you own me. So some people were like,

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:41.420
oh, you need to put like Stronny on it. But if you own me, I should technically have your name

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:52.300
on me. So I have a bowl coming with your name on it. And that's, I don't know if the collar's

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:57.340
going to say property of refling or just refling. I hope it says property of refling because I'm

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:04.300
going to come so fucking hard whenever I, you guys are getting the audio where you can literally

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:10.620
hear it like jingling on my chest. Or maybe I should put it on and then you can hear me put it on.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:19.420
I like it. Bit bread, bit bread, a little dollar change for you ma'am. Stronny, what? No, Ms. Mano,

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:27.260
you're not supposed to be here. Ms. Mano, Ms. Mano, I'm just, I'm confessing, Ms. Mano, I'm confessing.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:35.500
The accuser, purchase a new section in your computer. I heard all that. No, Ms. Mano,

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:41.500
that's even more embarrassing. Oh, I'm just gonna, I need to expand growth.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:09:01.900
I could probably change it. I have enough time. Did I goof? Shit. Did I mess that up? Am I supposed

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:12.220
to be strong on it? Am I that brain dead? The answer, yes. I unknowingly pulled up to the freaky

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:18.540
store apparently. Stop. No, this is Squid Mart. Welcome to Squid Mart where all your needs are

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:27.900
met. Are you okay? Ma'am? Oh my God, is she okay? Are you okay, ma'am? Ma'am? What do you need?

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:31.420
Are you being assigned? I think she's been assigned something on the shelf.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:40.300
I'll help the AI. Don't worry, I'm here. Oh, oh, she, I didn't know they had, you know,

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:45.100
crackheads in this game. That's terrible. Do not use such derogatory terms for people who are

01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:51.020
afflicted with the older addiction. That's terrible. I don't think she's feeling that good,

01:09:51.020 --> 01:10:01.660
I'm gonna be honest. Oh, my needs, go on. Can't make up her mind. Thank you, tiny spiny for the

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.860
tip. Okay, I will get that changed. There's more than enough time. I promise there's more than

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.900
enough because I only just did it. So I'm sure I can like change it because it gets custom made and

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:15.740
they had like a big warning that was like, oh, you need to give us like plenty of time.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:28.060
And vitamins to ensure our inks of THR best quality and potency. You only get two days a month after

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:36.700
all. Squid mark for all your inking needs. Not you guys learning. Oh, reluctantly saying that was

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:43.180
such a good bit. I love that. Not you guys learning about ovulation. Thanks to me. Oh, are you guys

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:49.020
okay? God, there's two now. What have I done wrong? I'm not sure what I've done wrong, if I'm being

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:53.660
honest. Right, the light's going on now. So this place isn't freaking dark. And you just put it on

01:10:53.660 --> 01:11:01.580
all the time. Damn, you and Belgan called it. She's undecided on what's a better product.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:05.420
Bro, they're literally, I don't, the AI is having a hard time with the oil right now.

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:13.020
I'm not really sure why. Come on, AI. Look at them heels though, heels. Oh, and they put in

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.740
height differences. Honestly, this has been quite a decent bit of, considering this is early access,

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:24.860
I mean, I would say it's pretty polished. Am I, am I going crazy? I know I shouldn't encourage,

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:37.580
but if it's not like a mega-cabillion thingy, I don't think it's actually a bad rate. If you

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:43.980
two, are you two, can you get out of me right now? Don't listen to them. I like property of

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:48.780
reefling on the collar. I can imagine giving it a little tug and pull you in for a deep,

01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:55.260
passionate kiss and a hard spank to your cuttlefish arse. Be a good little pet for me, strongy.

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.580
Are you squiddin' me right now? Right, well, I get two versions. I can get two versions. No cheese,

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:07.660
one star review. Stop. I'm working on the cheese, okay? A customer's out the, you guys weren't there

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:15.500
for ages. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I can't read chat. Oh, no, no. Fuck it. Take it. Take the change.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:20.940
You're welcome. Oh, you're going to complain after I give you extra change? Go away. Thank you so much.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:31.420
Red flame kraadin. Kraadin? Where are you from? Kraadin. Red flame kraadin. What? Why do I think

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.540
you're European? That's right. I've sussed you out. I'm coming to your house. What are you going to

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:40.700
do about it? I can just shortchange that person. You're selling a product without... Oh, and you

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:46.060
would buy four of them. I've not set the price. Oh, jeez. How do you do this? Oh my god. Oh my god.

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:50.220
I've not set the price. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese. Don't go for the cheese.

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.940
I've not set the price. Cheese. Three bucks. Go. Of course you'd buy the fucking cheese.

01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:03.740
I've not set the price. Your mum, yeah? Customer Greg? No way your name is actually

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:08.860
customer Greg. Please tell me you changed that to do that super chat. Is your name actually

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:17.820
customer Greg? That's your online handle. That's hilarious. Thank you for your one star review.

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:22.620
I'm trying my best, okay? Couldn't find the black... That's what I think about you, honestly. I'm fucking

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:27.820
getting tired of this shit. Everyone's so needy for a product I don't sell and they should have no

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:37.660
indication that I freaking sell it, honestly. Snowberries. Skippity. Why did you put on skippity?

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:46.140
That's going to be stuck in my head now. No, don't type that. Hi, snowberries. How is acicle stream?

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:52.700
Was she having fun with you? Was she tormenting you? Was she teasing you? Was she pleasing you?

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:59.580
That's what I like to hear. How could this delicious brat be so

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:10.860
gorgeous? Yeah, actually it's the other way around to do. I think the tormenting was the other way

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:18.300
around. You tormenting my precious little acicle? How dare you? Unless she likes it and that's

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:25.980
different. Well, there's cars in this game. I mean, in all honesty, what do they have to do

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:36.540
to polish off this game? I mean, the method seems to work of the shop. Am I going crazy

01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.060
and saying that this game really isn't that bad? Storage? I'm not going to bother with that. Just

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:45.260
seems like $800 for nothing. I don't know. Maybe it comes more... Is this a staff room?

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:50.860
Unironically, is this a toilet? This is where me and the reeflings go after a long day.

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:58.540
It's just a helping hand. It's levitating. Look at that PC. What are the specs?

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:05.660
There's a 1080 inside that for ordering stuff? Why do businesses get all the tax rebates? Why

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:10.140
can't I like an average show? I was in the snowys earlier and I came over here when your stream

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:17.580
started because I haven't seen a second of a velar stream before today. Oh, no. Oh, no. You picked

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:23.900
the worst. Don't start with me. Start with anyone else in velar. I'm the worst fucking choice to start

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.780
your velar experience with because I'm wildly inappropriate at all times. Are you squinting

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:33.580
me right now? Wildly inappropriate at all times. Since you seemed so excited about the property

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.340
of reeflings part, maybe the caller can say that and the bowl has your name so you know it's your

01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:45.420
bowl that we let you use when you're hungry for ink. Either way, it's about what gets you going more.

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:56.300
I think, why is it 55 bucks for that? Better be a big moneymaker. I think we're gonna get both.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:01.340
You're super wholesome. Oh, yeah. I'm the one of the few Americans who can understand the Scottish

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:09.420
accent. Like, I'm very lucky that you guys can understand it, but I do confess you're not gonna

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:20.620
like this part reefling. I purposefully annunciate more. I'm sorry. I do. It's just a tooth. Oh,

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:25.340
shit. I hate when I do that honestly. Are you squinting me right now? Oh, that was a lot of product.

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:32.220
Do you sell puppy tails? I need the plug type in three different training sizes. My cuttlefish

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:36.380
puppy girl is getting uppity and needs some correction via banal training.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:47.020
Okay, I may actually be buying that soon as well. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think I'm going to be

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:55.980
buying that soon. I need a new one. Okay, I need a new one. Thank you Anonymous for the tip and

01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:02.300
thank you Zarian as well. I might be getting that product. All right, I didn't want to be outrageous,

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:07.820
but I kind of want to show you guys all the things I want to buy in like a week's time,

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:12.460
but it's going to be really bad. Like, it's going to be really fucking bad. Excuse me, Ms.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:19.100
where do you keep the cucumbers and the lube? Why you ask for no reason? I'm sure. Hold on,

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:29.660
Anonymous. I'm sure I've seen that meme that is like by bomb bombs, by a cucumber and by lube and

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:35.820
then look the cashier dead in the eyes while you do it. Are you squinting me right now? For no particular

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:42.940
reason. Does this mean Stronny will be getting a tail soon? To go with the collar, we need to make

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:48.140
sure the collar is nice and tight around her neck so you can always feel like reeflings are

01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:52.140
gripping your throat and telling you to behave. Are you squinting me right now? I'm trying to do

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:56.380
my job here, not get away. What the fuck's going on? Hi, Stronny just wanted to let you know I walk

01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:01.980
my dog every day, but it makes me sad because I wish it was in his tent. Oh my god. I'm going to need

01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:07.900
a slippery caution, slippery one wet sign on the floor in a minute. What the fuck? We're not getting

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:13.820
sued, okay? We're not getting sued because someone had a little fumble. I'm not having it. Whoa, what

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:18.060
did I just give you? Ten bucks? Okay, that was really lucky. I still don't know how to retract

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:23.820
the money. I've yet to figure it out. Stronny, if you put them on throne, would be happy to buy it

01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:31.820
for you? Oh, I don't know. I find it so hard to accept gifts like that. I don't know.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:38.940
Like, I don't mind buying it. Am I weird for considering you're fairly normal and wholesome?

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:45.580
I mean, for the most part, you know, we've been chaining, don't you mind? I don't think, um,

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:51.980
flower is too expensive. I'm so sorry. My flower does not reflect today's prices. No, it does not

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:59.500
get aim. Two dollars for the flower. I apologize, my good sir. All yours, no change. Thank you for

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:08.540
your exact card. Yes, 19 dollars. Awesome degeneracy is what my wife and I call it,

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:13.740
honestly. Stronny with a short color refill. Well, I have a short color stream coming up

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:18.940
very quickly. So basically, there's going to be multiple streams for a little while.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:29.180
So don't be surprised if some of them are outrageous. I'm literally going to have to explain

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:35.900
to my dad that I'm doing a ring fit stream. So whatever he overhears, if he is awake, he is to

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:44.620
ignore because I'm going to be like a bus of ass. I have not exercised since debut. No, I am not

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:50.780
exaggerating. Bro, I'm getting you stuck in, man. Give me a chance to have some freaking stock. Right,

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:57.420
we need more stock of something. I don't know what yet. Cheese, milk, dark roast coffee is how

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:03.260
right. We'll get eggs as well. We've not had eggs. I'm getting a variety. I promise I'm getting

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:09.580
a variety. I promise. This puppy cuttlefish is going to need a muzzle to keep her quiet when

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:18.700
reeflings breed her like a bitch in heat. I'm at my job and you're in my earpiece telling me these

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:22.700
kinds of things. How am I supposed to look these customers in the eye and say have a good day?

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:29.820
I am trembling. I am quaking at this till right now. I'm trying my hardest to focus.

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:37.180
I am trying my hardest to focus and I'm quaking right now. It must be placed in a fridge. Okay,

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:43.580
that's fine. Oh my god, that is so sad. Pop that there because I want to make sure,

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:49.020
I want to make sure, okay. Mummy, now you know how all the reeflings who listen to you at work

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:53.660
still, it's still my favorite thing. Sorry, I'm making an audio for it. I don't care. I'm sorry.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:58.140
I'm sorry. I don't care. I need to make an audio for it. I need you. I have a matey.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:06.300
Don't buy the coffee. I've not set the price. Nine dollars. That's a big profit. Three dollars

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:14.940
per unit sold. I'm doing it right now. Whoa, this is our biggest freaking thing ever. Thank you.

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:23.660
Thirty two dollars. The pleasure is all mine. I assure you the pleasure is all mine. Why is

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:30.780
of course. Cheeky dollar change. All yours sir. Thank you. Thank you. Whoa. Okay, let's get that

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:35.340
light on. I can already see it getting dark. Don't think I don't know your games. Not again.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:41.180
Why are they struggling? Are you squiddin' me right now? With a pathing. What's the problem? The next

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:48.380
day, still no cheese. No, no, no, no. Cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese. Okay, cheese, cheese, cheese. Boom.

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:53.020
Cheese is in the cart. Cheese, cheese is in the front door. Freeze, cheese is in the front door.

01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:56.700
Oh my God, what are you talking about? I have no idea. Customer Greg, I have absolutely no idea what

01:21:56.700 --> 01:22:01.740
you're talking about, my good sir. Look at that. You even have two shelves of cheese. Your claims

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:08.060
of not having cheese, unfounded customer Greg. How dare you? Completely unfounded. I have absolutely

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:14.700
no, your accusations against my store. I ask you instantly to remove your one-star review and a

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:22.300
trip advisor to my freaking supermarket. It is unfounded and it is damaging the sales

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:26.940
and my profit margins. Change, no change, exact change. Thank you, good sir. Couldn't find the

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:31.020
cereal. Yeah, you're right. You can't find the cereal. You want to know why? Because there's

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:35.900
none in stock. Boom. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I don't know what you

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:41.980
mean. Thank you, customer Greg. And thank you Anonymous for all the tips. You guys are playing

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:49.020
with fire because the efficiency of the gameplay is about to severely go down if you keep this up.

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:54.780
Okay, card. Yes, $19. Thank you, good sir. All yours. Oh, thank you for your costume. No,

01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:00.620
appreciate it. Your change. $50, $20. Go. Thank you. Thank you. No, thank you. Cheese. Yes,

01:23:00.620 --> 01:23:05.020
cheese. Take the cheese. There's customer Greg right there in the making. There he is. He's

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:09.900
picking up some products. Oh, there you go. There's your cheese. Yep. Thank you. Please remove

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:15.420
that terrible review you left on the supermarket. Would appreciate it. I'm going to start slacking

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:20.940
off at work. Slacking off. Oh my God, that should be the name of the title. Slacking off with your

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:31.900
co-worker at work. Oh my God. I love it. Don't worry about being late, you goofy goober. You have

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:37.340
a sheebie ace of art to look forward to. Be kind, reeflings. Over exposure to work times,

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:43.420
mud can lead to premature ink ejaculation. It's a serious issue and affects one in every five

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:48.540
cephalopods. Are you squiddin' Maria? It's okay, my little cephalopods, I believe you. I can imagine

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:54.940
Strani as a puppy girl. I mean she has the tongue belicking, of course. And she did tell us yesterday

01:23:54.940 --> 01:24:00.380
that her cervix is good for doggy. Stop! If you don't use juice, cetentical bone, you are gonna

01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:07.100
have to bake like a good puppy. Are you squiddin' me right now? Stop! Strani, you are a good girl.

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:12.540
Stop! But don't worry, even if you misbehave, we'll still take you on walkies. You'll just have

01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:17.500
to be muzzled, blindfolded, and have an egg vibing in the clam for correction purposes.

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:24.700
I am interested. You can't be saying the stuff in my head, peas. We're getting explicit 50

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:35.820
nine. I can't focus on the numbers, Mason! Me next. Thank you anonymous and reluctantly seen.

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:42.140
Stop it! You're making me embarrased. God, you guys are really having... Why is it only women

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:47.660
have problem with the shelf? I'm starting to think something's going on here. What are the odds that

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:53.420
both women are known for window shopping and they can't decide on what product to buy at the stage?

01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:02.780
Stop. How is this on YouTube? Why? We're in a supermarket. What are you all about?

01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:08.140
We're in a supermarket. Excuse me, miss, you seem to have a wet patch. It is in aisle one,

01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:17.340
it had an odd taste to it, and also it smells like clowns. No! Strani, I think we need to get a

01:25:17.340 --> 01:25:25.180
clicker to help you stay motivated while working and be a good girl. No! Stop it! Thank you,

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:31.260
anonymous and rent desolation. Stop! Right, I didn't focus. You're getting redirected into

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:37.100
Sheebie's ASMR anyway, so she gonna keep you going. Right, I'm sorry but what is going on here?

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:46.220
Seriously, three of you make up your mind. Your husbands are at home wondering where you are

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:49.740
and you're just going nuts over the oil. There must be something wrong with the shelf.

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:58.780
I don't know. Can I push it forward? Carry? Okay. I'm just gonna move it forward.

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:08.140
No, it didn't make them adjust. Huh. What? What's wrong with the pathing? I don't see it.

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:17.740
It must be the product then. Hmm. User confusing me, ladies. I don't know what's the matter.

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:23.740
I'm afraid I don't know what the matter is. Right, I'm gonna try and sell out of my product to buy

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:32.220
the next upgrade to expand the shop. They're bugging. Yeah. They're bugging? I don't know what's going

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:47.660
on with them. Oh crap, we have bills to pay. Oh, come on. We're like all the way down again.

01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:53.420
This game is actually hard. Sorry, I said it. Last time you bought Flour, it fixed.

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:58.540
Are they wanting Flour? Is that why everyone's having a hard time? I'm gonna try and sell out

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:03.820
my product so I can expand the store. If everyone buys everything that I've got right now, then boom,

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:11.500
we can do the next objective. We will never make money at this rate. Typical Scottish corner

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:16.940
shop, actually, though. Our money. That game literally made the game wants us to take along

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:24.540
because we don't do that here. No, we don't borrow from the banks. We blow them up. Stop.

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:30.940
Refling. You can't say that out loud. But you were thinking it. All right, hydration check,

01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:32.380
refling. You need hydrate.

01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:41.740
Honestly, the begging girlfriend ASMR made you laugh your ass off. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:46.380
It was so fun to come up with. I came up with everyone's meme ASMR ideas,

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:51.580
but I didn't want to risk anyone's channel. I came up with that idea myself and I was like,

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:59.180
okay, I'll risk my channel by saying something silly like that. It popped off. It might hit 100K,

01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:05.660
which is insane. It's insane to say your first uploaded ASMR video might get 100K views.

01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:13.980
That's insane. I actually think we're gonna be... Oh, thank you for all your...

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:18.380
Your... Yes, thank you, custom. Thank you. Love you.

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:23.260
The gamble has played off, honestly.

01:28:24.540 --> 01:28:30.300
You did this to yourself, Strone. I remember you once challenging reflings that if they wanted

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:36.300
to dominate you, they'd have to do a lot better. Now we have finally found your weakness, Puppy

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:37.740
No!

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:46.540
No, no, no, no. I literally just got tingles. Like, my body literally reacted to that. What the

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:52.940
fuck? No! Thank you, anonymous, but no! Stop. I'm trying to freaking run a supermarket.

01:28:53.660 --> 01:29:02.700
Le supermarché. J'ai travaillé. Le supermarché, mes yeux. Non joué dans la

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.700
travailler. I'm fucking trying so hard to say stuff in French. Bro, right, relax. I don't

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:17.740
know what's going on. We're gonna need to move it. Can you guys let me put it down before you

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:27.500
come over and glitch out again? How do I take the stuff off the shelf? It's messing up my game.

01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:34.220
How do I take the stuff off the shelf? Okay, you know how I said the game's polished? I take

01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:45.900
it back. I take it back. The game's not polished. The women are stuck again. I'm trying. I'm trying.

01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:54.860
I'm trying. I think the game needs a little bit more work, but overall, we're getting there.

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:59.100
There's definitely something glitched out on that shelf. I'm gonna see if I can take the

01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:04.700
stuff off it, like the products off of it, maybe. I don't really know what the issue is.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:12.700
$24! All yours, sir. Thank you. We need $350 before the end of the day. And because you

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:16.700
are all being assigned here, I think we're getting less customers as well,

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:20.780
because the game can't assign too many customers at work. She's hypnotizing that.

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:24.620
They're baffled by the low prices. They can't comprehend.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:33.580
I think you need an empty box to remove stuff. Right, okay, let's grab a box. We'll just buy

01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:45.420
whatever. It's on cheap. Right, bread. Let's go. Purchase. Let's go. And then... No! Just wait a second,

01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:54.380
please. Close through, drop, take. Are you squiddin' me right now? The box doesn't match the size,

01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:58.300
are you jokin'? I bet you all it would take is a surprise slap to her arse or an extreme shock

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:03.260
to her collar. And she would be whimpering and panting and drooling at the mouth for her eflings.

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:07.980
I must have them hypno eyes rolling in the back of your head ahead of our style.

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.380
What am I even s-

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:19.180
What do I even see?

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:30.540
What was I supposed to see? Thank you, Rufeland, for the tips.

01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:39.580
And on to the mid-today, clearly. I thought I'm the one that's supposed to be coming up with

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:47.500
the scenarios, not you. Right, oil. Buy it and then get fricking rid of it off the dang shelves.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:53.340
Okay, yes, yes, yes, thank you. Thank you, Ruf. So got another week.

01:31:54.700 --> 01:32:00.460
Man, I'm sick of this TTS spam. I want to watch a Stranny Cutler stream, not Brian's, each.

01:32:00.460 --> 01:32:04.940
Are you had enough of Brian? Brian! Right, Brian, that's enough out of you, young man. Do you-

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:10.940
Did I make myself clear? Brian, no more. Okay. All right, as Brian dealt with, don't worry,

01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:17.820
I got you, Rufeland. Right, you, all. How do I put it in? Take. See you all glitching out.

01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:22.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And they all- Right, I'm leaving this

01:32:22.540 --> 01:32:27.420
box here in case it's glitchy, because what the heck was all that about, honestly? Oh, it's getting

01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:34.860
dark in the shop. Ah, it's getting dark. I'm scared of the dark unironically. Are you squidding me

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:45.660
right now? This place is too small and crowded. Two stars. Are you helping me? Are you- Wait,

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:51.500
are you helping me gameplay-wise via role-playing as a customer?

01:32:52.460 --> 01:33:01.820
Are you helping me gameplay-wise role-playing as a customer? I think you are, because we do need

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:16.220
to expand. We just need the 350. Thank you, customer Greg's- Wait, what? There's no way.

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:26.700
There's actually no way. I'm $1 short from expanding. This is meta. This is why I like

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:35.260
backseat gaming. That is so creative. That is so creative. I can even do that myself. Oh my gosh,

01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:42.780
right. Management, growth, section two. Purchase this section to expand. There we go, we did it.

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:51.500
Oh my gosh, that is hilarious. Thank you, customer Greg's fucking way to dollars change,

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:55.020
ma'am. Thank you. Couldn't find- No, you're not going to find nothing in this shop.

01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:08.220
Look at it. Oh my god, our scene got upgraded. It's getting so big. Yay. Okay, I need to push

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:15.100
the products back on the shelf. This is not backseat and you are in a video game. No, because

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:19.420
some features don't like it when you tell them what to do and I'm like, please help me so much.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:25.100
Thank you again for the tip. That was so creative. Customer Greg's wave, that's hilarious.

01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:32.700
Honestly, hilarious. Right, we're going to push some stuff back. We need to- I wonder if you can

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:41.340
buy the supermarket radio. Right, all the frozen products are going to go along this- well,

01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:45.500
or cold products, I guess. I'm going to keep the boxes in case something glitches out again,

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:51.980
because that was a bit of a nightmare to fix. Nice, it's not an average customer shop anymore.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:35:00.140
It's not. Look how big the windows are as well. We are up. We- oh my god, sorry. Can I just say

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:04.060
the serotonin boost of like physically seeing your shop getting bigger because all of your

01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:12.140
hard work paid off? I love these kind of games. Oh my god. I love these kind of games. I said it.

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:15.580
I said it. I'm sorry. I don't care. I said it. Right, what's the next objective? Oh, we haven't

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:19.580
been assigned one. Right, what are the bills? I'll pay the seven dollars. I can't pay rent.

01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:26.140
Stronny be a good girl. Roll onto your back and I will give you a some tummy rubs. Then if you

01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:32.940
keep being good, maybe I will give you this bone. No! You called yourself Stronny's trainer!

01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:42.860
Reef- wait, we only have oil. Reef-ling! You can't- oh, maybe that could be a nickname for you guys.

01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:45.100
You can be my personal trainer.

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:58.300
Could we get away with that? Could we? Should we? I don't know. Right, if I bought one of everything,

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:05.180
how much is that? Are you squidy? We can do 200 bucks. Remember, Stronny, if you want something,

01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:10.380
you are going to have to bark for it. A good girl likes you knows that you can't speak English.

01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:16.700
Years are done. Years are done. No more. Anonymous. Thank you. Me no, thank you.

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:22.220
Hey, I'm far in the back of this seat. Maybe keep a box for each product in the

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:29.500
storage for any more glitch shelves? Good girl. Okay. What is this? Is this a break room?

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:34.860
Are you squidin' me right now? Is this a break room? I got a bowl with her name on it so she can

01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:42.860
shlop. Shlop oman na ala corn on the cup. This should give me hate. I only have oil to sell.

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:50.380
This is literally an American supermarket now. America kanya! TTS was a mistake. Stop! Thank you,

01:36:50.380 --> 01:37:01.420
Tharia. IBW. Anonymous. Are you squidin' me right now? Knock, knock, mom, are you okay? Why are you

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:11.020
salivating in front of your monitor? This puppy salivating. Okay, everyone is buying oil.

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:16.700
Literally. Yeah, I know you can't find nothing. I ain't got no stock. Everyone please purchase the

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:25.180
oil at your next convenience, okay? Because we are running low on the market prices lower than

01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:29.180
three bucks. Okay, hopefully it changes as well. Oh my god, I think we're gonna have to like...

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:37.580
Oh, there's a customer. You spawned out of nowhere. You were not even in my shop a moment ago.

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:44.060
Please. Okay, everyone. Okay, yes, just buy oil. Thank you. This is helping so much. I'm not even

01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:49.100
kidding. Please continue to buy oil. Does someone say oil's American screeching?

01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:02.380
I have a really funny clip of Azura, actually. Thank you Momo for the tip as well. I have actually

01:38:02.380 --> 01:38:08.780
a really funny clip of Azura. I might send it to her and see if she will let me post it.

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:17.020
It was us before we did the group collab on debut. She randomly starts singing the American

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:21.660
national anthem, but Azura's got some lungs on her. She's like,

01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:28.220
and I'm like in the background. I'm like, make check, make check, and she's like,

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:36.300
I'm like, Amy, Amy, make check, make check, just so we can hear you. It was really funny,

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:40.940
so I'm gonna see if she's happy with me post it because it was hilarious. I'm like being super

01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:45.340
serious. Like, oh, that was good guys, right? Make check, mercy, make check, check, check,

01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:54.620
and then buy the drones early night. It was absolutely hilarious. So, okay, I'm gonna have to

01:38:54.620 --> 01:39:02.220
buy some product. That isn't like a squadillion dollars because, right, 64 bucks. Yeah, just,

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:07.740
yeah, one oil. Yep. I know you can't find anything, sir. You're gonna, you'll never guess why because

01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:15.020
we don't have anything in stock. I'm working on it. I'm working on it. We need an American flag

01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:25.660
bikini cookout, Azura. I think that is a fantastic alternative outfit for Azura. I actually fully

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.300
agree with that. I'm not even kidding. I actually fully agree. I want to see those bedonkers bedonking

01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:34.540
in an American bikini outfit. I'll take it. You can sing pretty damn well too though.

01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:40.940
Well, I got Emmy, we finally got Emmy's song cover, which I've not paid the guy for yet.

01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:43.740
Actually, sorry, if you're watching right now, I will pay you after the stream,

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:48.220
and I just need some time to nap after the stream, and then I will deal with the rest.

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:56.540
Gonna grill them dogs, honestly though. Are you squidding me right now?

01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:03.340
Just thinking about how a strong themed Tenga would go hard, and so would I.

01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:10.060
What's a Tenga? Oh, that's the wrong number. Thank you, Tharia, for the tip, or the super

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:14.380
trot. I don't know if I have to say super trot tip. I don't know. It's the same thing. What's a Tenga?

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.980
It sounds like a Konga. Konga, Konga, Konga, Konga. Tenga, Tenga, Tenga.

01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:26.940
Tenga is an honor hall. Oh, I've been singing about it.

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:32.140
I've been singing about it.

01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:50.140
Okay, then. That's what it's called. I've never heard that terminology.

01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:56.620
Oh, you've just absolutely messed me up. Give me that back, and then put it down there.

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:06.700
She's a degeneracy built into her blood. No, why did I buy more oil? We have more than enough oil.

01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:11.100
I'm gonna have to hire a reflin to go on the checkout, because this is getting tricky.

01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:15.580
This is getting tricky. Insufficient change. Oh, what?

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:22.940
Giving six bucks. Okay, make it four, and then do 120, then one. Jeez.

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:30.460
Sorry, sir. I can't count, but thank you for giving me the patience to count. Kind of blue.

01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:36.620
Come on, I need to restock here. Stop buying stuff. Give me a freaking moment to breathe. No

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:43.980
change. Thank you. Change two dollars. Thank you. Please, I need to like quickly buy stuff like

01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:51.340
right now, because everything is so empty. I'm literally just buying anything.

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:56.220
Please. I don't know. Bread? I've not had bread in a while. Go. Boom. We love bread.

01:41:56.220 --> 01:42:03.020
Shadow Wizard Money Gang. We love bread around these parts. She's an oil. Change. Oh my God.

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:08.140
Sorry. I love this game. I'm addicted. I'm not gonna lie. I think I could easily play 12 hours of

01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:10.780
this. I'm not sure anyone wants to actually sit and watch 12 hours of this.

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:19.580
I didn't take this phone like the good girl you are. Reflex where I played Supermarket Simulator.

01:42:21.980 --> 01:42:27.020
I didn't know the flubber aisle really got you going. Hey, Stronny, if you are a puppy girl,

01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:35.820
what breed would you want to be? I haven't thought that far ahead. I don't know.

01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:44.460
I have black hair, so this is an interesting TTS room. Literally, I'm like, is the bakery aisle

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:50.860
really getting you going that good? I mean, shit. I'll take it. I'm glad that you guys are enjoying

01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:57.980
it. Thank you so much. Stronny's trainer and anonymous. I am working on the stock issues,

01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:03.100
man. Please have patience for the love of God. I just get paid minimum wage. I just show up and

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:13.020
I'm trying. I'm actually getting stressed by my virtual job. I can't believe it. I can't handle

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:19.580
stress. Oh, God, the packages, please. Will someone please think of the packages? Milk is only two

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:28.220
dollars? What? I'm coming, please. Wait. I was gonna say three dollars seems a bit more,

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:34.780
a bit more economy related. Oh my God. I'm actually getting stressed. I can't keep up.

01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:39.980
Actually, unironically, can't keep up. Oh my God. I need help. I need help. I need an adult.

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:46.620
I need an adult. Wait. I'm the adult. No. I don't have time for all of this. Right. We've got sugar

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:50.140
again. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. All right. All right. All

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:56.780
right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can do this. I can do this. Ninety. Why would you

01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:04.540
give me such big number of change? The milk is French. Wait, is it? Does it say delay on it?

01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:13.580
Does the milk say delay? Milk semi-skilled. Boulay. What? It is French. Well, zero isn't French.

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:20.540
Okay. We're gonna unpack everything that we purchased. I have no idea what we purchased.

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:26.940
I was just busy panicking, but okay. Not to ruin it. Right. Close your ear canal if you don't want

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:34.140
to hear a spoiler on what one of the zero shorts are. She played supermarket simulator and one of

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:39.500
the things she said was like, do you want my milk basically? Because she was selling milk product.

01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:44.620
But it was like such a good clip and it's getting made and I'm so excited for it to come out.

01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:50.460
A British woman selling French product. Disgusting, honestly. What will they think?

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:56.940
Is there a Boulay? No. Don't call her that. I'm just kidding me right now.

01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:03.260
If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oils. Omega.

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:11.100
Wait, what does that mean? Azu Ryuji. Oh, come on. You need to make your names easier for me to say.

01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:19.740
What is that? Azu Re Ya Uji. Thank you for, thank you for letting me take your cherry yonk.

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:25.340
My cherry now. What are you gonna do about it? Yonkers. My super chat cherry now.

01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:32.620
I'm fucking it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fond de la bosom. Well, you should have heard of one of

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:37.180
the names. Right, I can tell you later but I can't tell you right now. Cover myself in oil?

01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:44.780
What? If it starts raining, I think I know what to do with all that oil. I'm to cover myself in oil?

01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:56.780
Hard-ass names, honestly. Oil up. Stronnycuddles oiled up when? Right now. I technically already

01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:01.340
made that ASMR but I got taken down but I'm gonna put it back up on September because it wasn't

01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:08.300
the clapping that got the video taken down. It was the breathing in the ear. Yes, that is true.

01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:13.900
How much is cheese? Cheese is three bucks. How much is pasta? Pasta is three dollars.

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:20.380
How much is bread? Bread, I am overcharging for bread. Very big. Very big overcharge? No, I will

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:33.500
not say why. Right, tea. I made a good profit from, we've not got, I think we need another fridge.

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:42.540
You know that. Oh, there's a thing as a double fridge. Oh, I mean, where are the floors? Oh,

01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:47.020
we can change the floor? I mean, I'm not really fussed for changing the floor. I'm not sure that's

01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:52.860
gonna make a difference to sales, is it? Unless the carpet is like absolutely minging, I think we're

01:46:52.860 --> 01:47:01.020
okay just to leave the carpet as it is. Right, pay my bills, pay my rent. I can't pay rent. Hiring,

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:06.780
right, what's going cashier? One, automated checkout, daily wage, 80 bucks, hiring cost,

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:16.780
100, complete checkout. What? Complete checkout, it requires store level 10. I can't hire you

01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:26.140
refling until store level 10? It's an old troll science comic. Oil floats on water. So to fly,

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:30.780
you cover yourself in oil, wait for it to rain, then you can fly for free.

01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:36.700
What? How was I supposed to get that reference? Thank you, tiny spiny. There's no way. Hire a

01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:43.580
reef stalker. Oh, that's actually pretty good. I'll take that. Please understand that algorithm is

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:47.820
unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the concept of breathing. Literally, though. Pass the three

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:55.100
bucks outrageous, honestly. How? Right, so I can't hire anyone yet. That's fine. Storage, I don't want

01:47:56.300 --> 01:48:04.060
customization. Oh, I can change the name by cost, money. Change entrance. No, thank you. I'll take

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:13.660
my tight clamp and elsewhere. Growth, right. Section three, four. So this is for the sigh. How much?

01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:23.660
How can I make this much profit selling eggs? How big can this game get? Product license. Peanut

01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:33.660
butter, flour. Oh my, this game is like way bigger than I first imagined. Banknot, market,

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:37.500
furniture, a new shelf maybe? How much is a shelf? 100 bucks?

01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:44.060
Maybe a shelf for more, although the... Oh!

01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:54.700
A checkout. Right, a checkout means we can hire a reflin at level 10. Okay. Okay, let's just focus

01:48:54.700 --> 01:49:01.660
on getting our money up. Okay, we can do that. Clamps to take, you need industrial pliers.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:07.260
Stronny, your bakery always gets me going. I will eat all of your cake. Once I am done,

01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:13.340
all that will be left is some cream. Are you... Are you fucking naming Stronny's cake on us, sir?

01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:19.100
That's amazing. Thank you for the tip. The bakery, the bakery's not open. All we have is sugar. We

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:24.380
don't even have flour. I'm out of flour already, literally. No, even started and I'm out of products.

01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:31.500
Where's flour? Go. Order. Oh no, there's something else in here. $60. Let's just get the

01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:37.820
flour in. Let's just get it in. Okay, a yolk now. Hee hee hee. Oh, I do have flour. Right,

01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:42.220
I'm just blind. I'm sorry I'm blind. Don't look at me. Don't look at me. Okay, I'm blind.

01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:49.100
Grilla's out of cake. Stronny provides the egg for the bakery. Did you know you spawn in

01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:54.620
with like 10,000 eggs and literally only like 100 or viable or something silly like that?

01:49:55.180 --> 01:50:01.100
There's like some, honestly, I could talk about like pregnancy and ovulation cycle and all that.

01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:08.780
Speaking of ovulation, thank you very much for your custom goods, sir. Oh no, the conversation I'm

01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:14.780
having in the headset, it's just with my co-workers. They're locked in the room right now in the staff

01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:20.220
room. I just don't have access to my co-workers yet. It's fine. No, no, don't report me for the

01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:24.700
conversations. I know you can't find the cereal. I can't afford the cereal. That's why you can't

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:30.780
find it, sir. Okay, I can afford it this time. Okay, you just spend your time at the shelves

01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:35.420
a lot, but no, no, no, don't go to the- thank you. They're so quick. Like, they honestly didn't

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:38.860
give you like, I'm sorry, but you can actually see me restocking and trying to do all these

01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:44.780
jobs at the same time. And they're like, servicing now, please. I don't know your marks. I'd be

01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:50.380
too shy to say anything though. I don't know if that's the component, but like, you have no filter,

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:56.860
by the way. I know I'm aware. I'm sorry. I apologize. How do we restock your eggs? No, you

01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:03.660
spawn in with them. You spawn in with all the eggs. You don't generate any new eggs at birth or

01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:10.860
anything like that, like after birth or anything. You spawn in like that for genetic material. It's

01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:14.860
actually really fascinating. I don't know. I don't know how you felt about the education stream

01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:20.620
yesterday. I had a blast, okay? I'm gonna be honest. I had a blast. Sorry, I like education. I think

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:26.460
it's fun. And I didn't know if you guys knew I was gonna give you a little quiz at the end,

01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:33.180
but I was like giggling away, kicking my feet under the table when I was making my wee thing up

01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:37.900
for years. I was like, I'm gonna get him. This is how I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:42.540
do that. Are you squeezing me right now? And I'll do that. I bet Stronny would love a refling

01:51:42.540 --> 01:51:47.900
growling in her, like a predator ready to turn her into prey. Little pup will learn her place

01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:53.420
under her alpha refling. What? The list, how wet is the fabric of your chair from this teasing?

01:51:53.420 --> 01:52:05.820
Stop! I'm in the supermarket! Les supermarchés! Arrête! Arrête! J'attends la fucking supermarché,

01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:12.940
man. Fucking hell, reflins. Why are we all, why are we so, what happened? What, is it filming?

01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:17.740
Why are we all so revved up? Give us a week. Give us a week. Give us a week, okay? A week and then

01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:23.980
it all starts up again, okay? Because we, something's going on with us right now. It is a film.

01:52:25.180 --> 01:52:30.220
It's a full moon, clearly, because what's going on? No, I'm just purchasing stuff. Please,

01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:36.860
give me a sec. I swear the game makes them teleport as soon as you look away for a millisecond.

01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:42.300
Out my way, ma'am. You're in my way. Right, coffee. Oh my god, that's so satisfying the way

01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:48.540
they stalk. Oh, I just walked into them. Okay, small age happy break. If us

01:52:48.540 --> 01:52:54.380
reflings were to work in your store, what type of uniform would we have? Just the hat or would

01:52:54.380 --> 01:53:03.740
we have a little shirt as well? Would you have a shirt? I don't think I'm a uniform. That's a

01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:11.340
good question. I need an easy access uniform. I said what I said. I don't care. I'm sorry. I said

01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:16.700
what I said. I need an easy access. That's it. That is how I will deal with the nine to five.

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:20.220
Most people need alcohol at the end of the day to deal with their nine to five.

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:24.140
Some people need smoke cigarettes for the nicotine hit. Some people, you know,

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:28.540
recreational drugs to deal with the nine to five at the end of the day. I just need easy access.

01:53:28.540 --> 01:53:35.340
That's all I'm asking. Velcro? Velcro? That would be hilarious. I'm sorry. That's absolutely

01:53:35.340 --> 01:53:42.620
hilarious. Velcro all constantly like every 10 minutes, all you hear is and then in the break

01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:53.020
room, just every two seconds. That's honestly hilarious. I let you weren't you were not even

01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:58.060
approaching this till I swear you were not even approaching this. There's no way and it's getting

01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:05.500
No, stop. I'm just turning the lights on, please. Turn the lights on. Why is there so many

01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:11.580
customers? Apologies, Mamalaz-Riflin saw a cute supermarket worker working the cash register

01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:17.900
and we couldn't resist. See her blush. Stop. Okay, that was a compliment. So I'll take it.

01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:25.740
Why is there so many customers? What's going on? Don't you all have like wife and kids to go home to

01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:30.780
juice? What do you mean you're getting milk to go home? Thank you Anonymous for all the tips.

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:35.500
You're all called anonymous, but I don't want to grip you together. I will thank you individually.

01:54:35.500 --> 01:54:39.660
Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. Thank you Anonymous. I'm under the counter.

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:43.500
It's raining some strange liquid and I'm hearing some wild shite.

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:53.900
You're not hearing anything. This place is empty. Needs more items. Three stars. Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:59.580
We're getting up. There we're getting up. Wait, wait, that's a new, you're making new

01:54:59.580 --> 01:55:06.220
YouTube accounts because that's your first super chat registered on the account. There is no way

01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:14.460
you're going to all that effort. You're making new YouTube accounts to stream snipe in game.

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:25.740
Thank you customer Gregson. Oh my God. That's amazing. Momo, thank you for the tip as well.

01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:33.820
There's strange liquid stuff. Oh my God. How are you going to such efforts?

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:40.220
Right. I'm just going to completely sell out a product. I know I should probably order before.

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:46.940
Order. Have you guys been on TikTok to that Scottish Chinese shop? I'm so sorry to

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:52.540
completely derail with brain rot. So on TikTok, there's this Chinese Scottish shop

01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:59.740
and she like packs the orders, but she's got a funny accent. So she goes, come pack this customer's

01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:06.460
order with me. This family needs 100% discount and some special treatment.

01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:14.220
Yeah. Oh, thank you. This family needs 100% discount honestly though. Order. Yes,

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:21.900
fucking sin sister knows what it is. It's Becca's takeaway. And she's like, come with me today to

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:28.060
pack this customer's order, but it's like a vocal fry on order. So it's like order.

01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:34.780
Because it's not really that common to have a vocal fry in Scotland. It's rather,

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:40.460
it's very Americanized if you will. Oh my God. Don't talk about America Challenge failed yet

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:45.420
again. Honestly, I can't believe it. Right. What have we got? I definitely need in a much bigger

01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:53.740
fridge. I'm needing a bigger refrigerator. Right. We are going to preemptively pay all of our rent

01:56:53.740 --> 01:57:00.140
issues. I don't feel like I'm making any profit. Am I going crazy? But I feel like I'm like losing

01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:07.660
money somehow. Like I'm struggling to pay these bills. Me and Strone are going to do an

01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:14.220
really Scottish tourist stream and we're going to go to a mukbang at Becca's. But I'm packing this

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:19.900
order for two v-chippers. Would you guys still love me if I had a vocal fry?

01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:28.380
Okay. Wait. How can I do a vocal fry on a Scottish accent? Order. Good afternoon, Henry

01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:39.500
Flings. I hope you're doing well. I could not maintain that. That's hideous. Right. Let's buy

01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:48.780
the big wall of ours. What have we got? $200? Oh, we're doing math with my order. Oh my God.

01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:52.940
That's awful. Please do not speak for the rest of the stream. I'm sorry. Thank you. Are you

01:57:52.940 --> 01:58:00.460
squiddin' me right now? Wow. At this point, forget the ASMR booth. Just open a store staffed by

01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:06.300
Reeflings. Okay. You can stay in the break room and be in charge of Team morale. We may be hard,

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:13.100
but you can take it. No need to be a good girl. You can be our bad girl. Wait, but would that

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:17.660
actually boost morale? Like, unironically, you know how like businesses are all like, I'm trying to

01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:25.100
boost the morale of the staff without increasing their wages or whatever. I'm like, I feel like

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:30.140
that might work. You know, just me sitting in the staff room being like, how are the sales good?

01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:37.580
And then pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. This is the most inappropriate conduct a store has ever.

01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:43.580
I think business would be booming though, you know? And like, as like, as a customer,

01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:49.580
you come in and then like, all you hear is like muffled like, like behind the door is like,

01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:53.500
is everything okay back there? It's just like, yeah, we're just expanding the shop. We're drilling.

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.940
We need to drill holes in the walls. So that's what that noise is.

01:58:58.700 --> 01:59:02.460
Thank you, Zarian, for the tip. I think I've seen that video on a certain way. So,

01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:10.140
Chinese, Scottish, YUMMY. I miss a Chinese. Right. I'm going to buy all the products tomorrow

01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:14.700
and I'm going to go crazy and stack all the motherfucking jobs. Products found expensive,

01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:19.900
products not found. Right, relax. Right, we can't all fricking, right. I know the market price is

01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:28.460
changing. I'm sorry, but I ain't got time. Okay. Order. Oh, you can-

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:39.340
I mean, you're not wrong. You're not, I didn't realize you can run in this game.

01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:44.300
Oh my gosh. How long have I been on this game for? And I didn't know you could fricking run.

01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:54.220
Look how fast I am. Are you serious? You can run in this game the whole time? I am so fast.

01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:03.580
I am so fast. Is this a joke? Oh, I can't sell the egg. Sorry.

02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:10.300
Right. I am so fricking fat. Oh my god. Wait, why did I buy so many fridge stuff? I don't have room

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:20.540
in the fridge. Everyone watching the products expire. Oh my gosh. I didn't know you could move in this-

02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:24.220
Oh, open, open. I was wondering why the customers aren't coming. Wait, how do I clean the outside

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:30.060
of the shop? It's dirty. Oh my god. This is not, this is not raising my beleveliness.

02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:33.980
Oh, whatever that word is in Japan, beleveniminess. Oh, if we're going to say

02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:41.980
belevenus, that's the word belevolne. What is that word?

02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:52.780
Your belevolence. Your belevolence? Benevolence. Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Right.

02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:59.260
Change 30 bucks. Go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm working on the oil. Okay. I'll order oil, jeez.

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:04.780
I'm trying. I'm trying. Okay. I have time. I have time because I can run.

02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:10.940
Bruh. Why did I not figure out you could run? Can you crouch? No, you can't crouch. Are you

02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:14.220
squiddin' me right now? Okay, you can't crouch. It's fine. It's fine. No, don't bug out.

02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:22.060
I feel out of place here as a sub. You're allowed to be a sub.

02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:27.980
I'm pretty, I'm pretty alright. I mean, if you've listened to the new Patreon audio,

02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:34.300
ain't no way you're a, you're a dumb in that audio. Look at the state of this place.

02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:42.140
Riefland should be picking up the boxes. I'm going back to Tescos, honestly. Benevolence. Benevolence.

02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:47.900
Okay, that sounds right. That sounds correct. I wish, I'm going to have to order, order

02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:53.260
freakin' tea so I can put these away again. I don't know. There seems to be something about

02:01:53.260 --> 02:01:57.820
the bottom, like, left or, I don't know. Sliced bread is too expensive.

02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:04.620
Okay, I agree with you. I'm sorry. I agree. I do agree. I agree. I agree. I'm sorry.

02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.420
Look, the prices change every day. Isn't it funny how the prices change every day,

02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:13.340
but they continue to go up and they never go down, even though there might be moments in time

02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:17.660
where things aren't as expensive as they should be. Isn't that curious? Curious, curious. Yeah,

02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:23.100
that's what I think about you. Right, bread. We need more bread. Bread, bread, bread, bread.

02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:28.380
Oh my God, fast. I'm fast as fuck, boy. Oh my God, sorry. This is so sad. It's fine to re-stock as

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:36.700
well. I'm so fast. I'm so fast. Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so fast. Sorry. This is the most

02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:40.460
efficient shop. Sorry. Sorry. I need to unlock that break room, like, right now because the

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:44.620
reflins are waiting on my thoughts. Either the reflins are waiting on me or I'm waiting on them.

02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:48.860
You know how it is around these parts, baby. Oh, I need the coffee box and tea box. Are you

02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:54.300
squidding me right now? I need the tea. Give me the tea. No wonder Dad doesn't come here. There are

02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:59.420
no items. No, no, there is. There is. I'm waiting for people to freaking buy this. Are you squidding

02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:04.220
me right now? There's milk and water, but no one's buying. ASMR, Scottish Cuttlefish Attempts

02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:10.860
to Learn Her Second Language, English. Stop! It's true. It's actually true. No, it's true. It's

02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:16.620
true. Thank you, tiny Spanish. That's actually so true. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm working on it,

02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:21.820
daughter. I'm working. Customer Greg's daughter. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I need to fix the glitch

02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:26.380
that's going on right now. I can't believe reflins are about to turn Strani into a free-use public

02:03:26.700 --> 02:03:31.500
owner. Hold. I don't think we can say that. Can we say that out loud? I don't know.

02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:41.740
Greg got a nuclear family. Literally, Greg is winning at life. Right, put all of this shit in

02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:49.500
the box. Stop. Whatever it, stop. Literally, stop. Whatever you guys are doing, knock it off. I'm

02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:53.980
getting fed up. I'm getting, I'm not putting anything bottom right because it seems to be some sort of

02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:58.220
weird glitch. $12. Thank you, ma'am. Are you squidding me right now? I apologize for my remarks.

02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:04.940
I was getting frustrated that none of... Bark, bark. Growl. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:15.420
Now that add-on is being the Doug Customer Greg's daughter's dog. Are we role-playing as a

02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:20.140
meta role-play as I'm getting advice to play this game? This is, this is getting insane.

02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:26.700
It's just getting insane. This is amazing. Oh my god, look at the money rolling in now.

02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:32.700
Oh, I need to hire, refland. I need to hire you so badly to get on the till. This is like,

02:04:32.700 --> 02:04:39.100
it's never ending. It's never ending. There's so many of you. What's going on? Why? Because I fixed

02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:46.140
the glitch, I think. Boom. Right, we've have $150. Can people start buying from the fridge?

02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:50.540
My products are going to go, they're going to spoil. I'm not even kidding. I need a new fridge.

02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:57.100
It's better to buy the 375. I don't have 375 though.

02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:02.460
Thank you, Anonymous. I can't believe reliefans are about to turn strong in there for you.

02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:07.180
Ah, no, I'm not reading that out loud. Stop it, Anon. Bad Anon. Spank.

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:15.260
Tell me when Shibi goes live, by the way, just because she's doing ASMR today.

02:05:15.260 --> 02:05:18.460
And Shibi is so close to 10k and I'm so excited. I'm about to...

02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:26.140
I'm so excited for my genmei's success. Please give love and support to my genmeis.

02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:29.420
I'm so proud of them and they're so hardworking and I love them and I'm going to kiss them on the

02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:41.420
mouth. Anyway, that's just me. Shibi's live. Oh, I think her supermarket enterprises might be over

02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:50.220
with. I don't know. I'm going to record that. My dad guessed in each of her names shortly.

02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:55.260
Right, I'll play another day. I'm totally not addicted to this game, by the way.

02:05:55.900 --> 02:06:00.300
But yes, my dad is going home in like a week's time, so I'm going to be depressed. But the

02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:05.980
good news is there's going to be tons of streams. But deep down, I'm going to be sad inside.

02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:14.300
But you cheer me up. And I get to play loads of games with you again and I get to do all the

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:19.580
ridiculous plans again. And I get to record all the ASMRs because I have tons of people waiting

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:26.540
on me to do collab ASMRs. So there's going to be content out there. But the only exchanges that

02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:34.460
my dad has to go on. But that's okay because that's how life works sometimes. Okay, let's

02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:42.540
very quickly buy new stock. Can I very quickly do this? Stock, you, you just shove everything in.

02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:45.820
Literally shove everything in. Are you squiddin' me right now? Please.

02:06:55.820 --> 02:06:59.740
I think we're going to get in trouble. You guys are going to have to start substituting the way I

02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:04.140
do. You guys are going to have to start substituting because I'm getting, stop buying milk! Oh my gosh,

02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:09.340
stop buying milk. Stop buying refrigerated products. Please, I'm begging. Please, brain,

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:15.020
stop messing up so badly. Right, you. Right, you guys are going to need to start substituting

02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:17.820
because I'm getting nervous for this board now. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous,

02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:20.860
but I'm glad you enjoyed the boot although. Because not everyone does it. Some people are like,

02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:25.820
oh my god, I hate it. I hate it. It's like, bruh, bruh! Let's just role play. Close your eyes. It's

02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:30.780
not real. Close your ears. Close your ears. You're subjecting yourself to something you don't like.

02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:37.500
Close your ears. Honestly, my dad literally listened to this conversation being like,

02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:43.500
what the fuck is going on in that room? What do you mean I have product? No! You're not supposed

02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:47.900
to do that. I'm glad you went flower all yours. And you gave me a perfect change. Thank you, sir.

02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:53.980
Have a good night. Have a good evening. I appreciate you. Can I please? Why are people not buying?

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:55.580
I mean.

02:07:55.580 --> 02:08:00.780
Strongly, I will gift so many memberships if one day you can do an alternative outfit of you as

02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:08.460
a puppy girl. I'm begging you. I don't, I mean, so my donathon is coming up. I've said like,

02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:15.500
my donathons more like group activity stuff or like free access stuff. I've got about free use

02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:23.180
on my mind now. Like, accessible stuff. You don't have to pay to access it. If you guys wanted to

02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:28.140
like, I'm not going to stop you from like picking out because Azura is going to pick out what she

02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:31.740
wants to do for her donathon. I assume she's going to do the same thing she needs next after.

02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:45.420
Strongly cut us oiled up in 4K is currently the search suggestion. Thank you so much for letting

02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:49.500
me yank your boy chair. Wait, what? Did I not yank your boy chair like two minutes ago?

02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:55.340
We are good fish, believe us, maybe. We are good fish. We're the goodest fish in all the land.

02:08:55.340 --> 02:09:02.300
We just mind yourself swimming and stuff. Yeah, if you guys want to, as if I'm going to say no

02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:07.500
to a fucking alt puppy outfit, if you guys want to, you know, you know, hit me up, dab me up.

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:14.380
Are you joking? I'll be a puppy VTuber. Are you joking? Like, literally, I will get the custom

02:09:14.380 --> 02:09:19.180
collar and it literally says property of reefling and then I'll get a toggle and everything and

02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:23.020
please don't think I'm not going to do that because I'm a laundry serious. Right.

02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:30.860
Okay, let's do this and then pop that down and then let's sell these eggs because they are

02:09:30.860 --> 02:09:39.820
literally rotting. Are you squidding me right now? Oh, eggs are only one. Free you zone a hole? No,

02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:43.740
she's still in charge, but I'm about to make her into a Twinkie.

02:09:44.860 --> 02:09:48.540
Reeflings, right, we're about to get in trouble. We're about, we're unironically about to get

02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:53.740
in trouble. Stop it. I'm going to have to spank you, okay? You've been naughty right now. Oh,

02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:57.900
hold on, hold on, right, put the cheese in, right, the cheese has probably expired like half a century

02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:03.340
ago, but hey ho, and that's not going to stop us. Came back just in time for the pet play,

02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:07.420
rip Vod. Honestly, I'm starting to get, I'm getting nervous for the Vod. If we can all

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:16.380
take a deep breath and get ready to be redirected into Sheebie's lovely.

02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:24.380
Four dollars for eggs? Sheesh, don't mind if I do. I mean, honestly, this isn't that badly

02:10:24.380 --> 02:10:28.860
stopped in all consideration. Right, we'll play one more day and then we're redirected into Sheebie.

02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:36.460
No, I'm not addicted. Are you squidding me right now? Hey, are you guys hiring? I have no experience.

02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:41.740
Unemployed Greg's grandson. Look, you have to start somewhere with experience. Don't you love it when

02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:46.860
places require you to have experience, but they won't hire people who've never had experience

02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:53.660
before? Isn't that a fascinating point of them being in a part of this society? Hmm, isn't that

02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:58.380
curious that they make it really impossible for you to even get an entry level job without having

02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:03.020
a freaking PhD in fucking Yunnan? Honestly, it's getting outrageous. Don't you just love that

02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:09.420
part of society in the community at large? Don't you just fucking love it? Literally,

02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:13.340
don't you love it? This is getting a bit too real, honestly. Are you squidding me right now?

02:11:14.940 --> 02:11:19.740
Might be the cutest Twinkie I've ever seen. You think I'm a cute Twinkie?

02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:27.180
Thank you as a Rijie for letting me pop your cherry again. I don't know why YouTube said

02:11:27.180 --> 02:11:32.540
let me do it twice, but it did. Anonymous. Bit of strong eats. Oh, not whole. Oh my god. I think

02:11:32.540 --> 02:11:40.220
I missed that. Oh, I didn't realize you called yourself that. Thank you, Momo. Thank you, Zion.

02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:46.060
Thank you, unemployed Greg's grandson and Momo again. Literally five years experience for an

02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:50.220
entry level job, like fucking calm down. Honestly, I could absolutely kick. I was going to say the

02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:56.940
C word, but you're not allowed to say the C word. Graduate with a bachelor's degree, and I can't

02:11:56.940 --> 02:12:02.860
even get an entry level retail job. Honestly, ma'am, why are you giving me that much change?

02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:07.980
Don't do that again. That made myself clear. Don't do that again. Four bucks change. Let me think.

02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:14.140
All yours. I'll always just go for the dollar bill. Searching for 10 years experience in a 25-year-old

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:19.980
is a while. Are you squidding me right now? It is. That didn't answer my question. Yes, I will hire

02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:23.420
if you don't have experience because I'll teach you everything I can teach you.

02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:31.740
Okay, now that's a tall order. Thank you for your custom search. This is our biggest order.

02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:40.860
$29 reduced. Thank you. Thank you for your custom. That's our biggest sale yet. I can't believe it.

02:12:40.860 --> 02:12:47.260
I can't believe having an array of products leads to people purchasing it multiple versions of it.

02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:51.500
Shocking behavior. Honestly, shocking. Absolutely shocking. Good girl, strongy. I knew you could

02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:58.220
be a good if you tried. Keep this up and I will give you a treat later. Okay, that's acceptable

02:12:58.220 --> 02:13:03.660
because that's implications, but it's not going to get as bad. Yes, I will hire, I will teach you

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:10.860
everything I know, and then you can be, and I'll vouch for your CV. I saw, oh my god, I should get a

02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:15.820
throwaway number that you guys can use for a CV, and then they'll phone up and they'll be like,

02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:21.180
hey, Anon says that you worked, they worked for you for like a year. Can you tell us about their

02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:24.780
experience and all that, and I'll just like straight up like guess you up. I'll be like,

02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:30.060
yeah, he was absolutely fantastic. I cannot recommend the employee. I was really sad to see him go,

02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:35.900
but unfortunately, because I, you know, I had a few complications with my health, I could no

02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:41.900
longer employ him, but Anon's perfect 10 out of 10. I so want to do that. That'd be the funniest

02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:47.740
thing ever. Like I'll give you an email. I wonder why Grandpa hates this place. No, Grandpa likes

02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:52.940
it. Look, I've got tons of products. Like come on. So I actually, this, I'm doing really well,

02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:58.140
so I'm actually doing so well. So I don't believe you. I don't believe you first, I think. I definitely

02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:04.060
need like a double fridge though. This is getting like outrageously. Oh, I'm about to be able to afford

02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:11.020
a double fridge. Don't mind if I do. Any references? Yeah, I'm the reference. She's such a sweetheart.

02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:14.860
I'll get you guys on a job somewhere. I know exactly what they want to hear because,

02:14:14.860 --> 02:14:20.380
you know, if you didn't know. Well, now you know, hydration check, refling.

02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:29.500
I'm waiting for my application to be approved. I need to be level 10 before I can hire a

02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:36.780
refling, unfortunately, Greg. Grigory. I wish I wasn't so scared. I would love to play Fanaf,

02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:40.620
but I get very scared. I literally have a heart attack at the concept of the game.

02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:49.100
So we shan't be playing Fanaf. But we can definitely watch the Fanaf movie.

02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:58.060
Hear me out. Fanaf movie and a karaoke thing. Watch along. And we'll watch. I'll tell you what,

02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:03.660
I'll get Emmy to play Fanaf, right? And then I'll watch her play it. And then we'll do the

02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:08.220
Fanaf movie and then we'll do Fanaf karaoke. How about that? So I don't have to play it. I don't

02:15:08.220 --> 02:15:16.860
have to be. It's just we shit in my panty loons. You know what I'm saying? Change 44. Oh my God,

02:15:16.860 --> 02:15:22.060
I'm so smart. What? Oh, wow. Sorry. Business is actually booming. What do you mean a fully

02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:28.220
stocked shop equals business booming? Because I can, I literally am so busy now.

02:15:28.940 --> 02:15:34.700
Oh, are you squidding me right now? Are we flings? No, you spelled it wrong!

02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:36.380
My flings, I missed hearing that.

02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:41.340
Violetton, Violetton, the other spelling. We're under the water, Violetton. Violetton,

02:15:41.340 --> 02:15:47.180
the other spelling, the other spelling, the other spelling. Honestly, it's genuinely not

02:15:47.180 --> 02:15:51.340
a big deal. I literally paid for your concept and created you type thing. Nothing was a sign.

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:57.420
So literally saw his butt. But we spell it ee, r-e-e-fling. Thank you so much,

02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:03.820
Violetton, for the 20. And it's nice to see you again. Nice to see you. Nice. Any old

02:16:03.820 --> 02:16:08.860
refling, any new refling. Don't worry, you're all equally getting shagged. Shut the fuck up!

02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:14.620
Sorry, I'm hyper. I'm really enjoying this game right now. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:22.540
I'm sorry. I'm enjoying this game thoroughly. It's the game. It's, it's the game. Okay, I'm so sorry.

02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:29.500
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Right, we're gonna order,

02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:36.700
I dare, the double fridge, and then we're gonna order some product. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm so sorry.

02:16:37.340 --> 02:16:43.820
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Right, hold on, how do I do that?

02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:50.780
Are you squidding me right now? You are? Yeah. Reflings are down bad. Uh-huh. Sorry,

02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:55.820
Strani, we've been very bad boys. You have, yeah. Whatever could we do to make up for it,

02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:58.620
underscore sweat, and then you just said that.

02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:05.820
Like, like chat reflects the streamer, okay, and streamer reflects the chat.

02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:14.620
So maybe, sorry, and thank you. I am so sorry. That was wildly inappropriate.

02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:19.500
Me, when the stream gets taken down, like, ah, okay. Are you squidding me right now?

02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:24.060
Truly, wholeheartedly. I'm sorry too. Sorry that we aren't in the straight line right now.

02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:28.460
Like, it's locked. I don't know how to get into it. I think if we expand the store and

02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:31.180
off and let me do that, I'm gonna very quickly buy some more products.

02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:41.020
I like to sing, I like to dance, but I can't do it with a pew pew in my pants. Got focused.

02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:47.180
Look, I'm working out, look, the reason why stock is low, you're gonna shit your pantyloons

02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:52.940
when you realize stock is low because you guys are buying all the stock and I am a one-man army,

02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:59.420
please. Lose, just buy the tea. Okay, he's actually buying like tons of tea though. Thank you.

02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:08.060
Eggs and tea, that's what I like to sing. I'm down for apocalyptic. What? I'm down apocalyptic

02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:16.140
for strong. What? Apocalyptic? What? Apocalyptic. Oh, apocalyptic is a word. Yes, it is a word,

02:18:16.140 --> 02:18:20.300
actually. Now that you mentioned it, apocalyptic is a word. Okay, I'm done. I'm not speaking for

02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:25.820
the rest of the stream. Whoa, I can't even speak English. Right, water. Pop it there.

02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:35.020
Eggies. Pop it there. Okay. Whoa, I thought we were finished with customers. Jump scare,

02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:42.220
honestly, geez. Down the apoliptical, honestly, isn't that a machine in a gym? The apoliptic is?

02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:55.180
I cannot freaking speak right now. I'm starting and stammering. Someone clipped when I was very

02:18:55.180 --> 02:19:04.220
kindly gifted like 10 memberships and I was like, I was just an absolute shambles. It was a shambles.

02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:09.740
Right, let's clean this up. We've got a few, just a few deliveries, just a few deliveries. Right,

02:19:09.740 --> 02:19:13.260
we'll clean all this up, we'll do one more date and then I'm redirecting into Sheebie and there's

02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:19.260
nothing you can do about it. You're getting loved on by the bun. She got buns of steel, okay? You're

02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:23.820
getting loved on by the bunny. She's an ASMR. Please subscribe. She's almost hit 10,000 subscribers,

02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:30.860
which is freaking awesome. As I said, the girls are like, they're just so fantastic and they're so

02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:35.420
excited to reach these milestones because it's like, that's right, Strani give up on speaking English

02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:43.340
and just bark for us. Stop! Make sure you get a good reward. It's so anonymous. Stop.

02:19:44.940 --> 02:19:52.620
I have another week to wait. I have a whole week. I can't do anything for a week. Knock it off.

02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:59.340
I'll start barking orders at you. Thank you for the tip though. And Momo, thank you for the tip

02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:06.940
with the pew pew. Any purers? Any self-identified purers? I pee. I pee my pants. Sorry. I don't know

02:20:06.940 --> 02:20:14.060
why I always make that joke. I don't know. I find it funny. Yes, also Sheebie's dream. Well,

02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:18.780
Sheebie said she wanted a play button. So I told all the girls I will do everything I possibly can

02:20:18.780 --> 02:20:25.740
to achieve a play button for you goofy gibbers. So if you didn't know, I have fantastic news. If

02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:34.540
you're a clipper, Veilure is coming out with a clipping program very soon TM. And the current,

02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:39.980
now you do have to apply and be accepted for it. You can't just automatically get it overnight. But,

02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:49.100
but for every 1000 views you get, we have, we are going to trial $2 per every 1000 views you get

02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:55.020
in the clipper program because we want to say a special thank you for taking the time to go

02:20:55.020 --> 02:21:07.980
through VODs and edits. So we're going to offer $2 per 1000 views and the ceiling price is 100k.

02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:15.340
So for one clip you could in theory get $200. However, it does have to have an expiry date

02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:19.740
because we can't like pay you out like three years after, you know, the clips are, you know, the girls

02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:26.060
are, you know, um, but if the clip gets over 100k views, but it reaches like a next milestone,

02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:30.700
you also get like a bonus on top, but it's not 2000 per views. Like cause I didn't,

02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:34.780
I didn't want to insult why am I standing here? Bro, it's the end of the day. Right. One more day.

02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:38.700
Well, just give me one more day. Just give me one more day. What do I need? I need cereal.

02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:47.260
I need a lot. Right. What do I need cereal? There's already flour. I need oil.

02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:52.220
Water? Are you squidding me right now? More cheese. Why not? We'll buy all that in the month.

02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:57.500
Screw the two dollars. For every 1000 views I want licking the ear from mama.

02:21:57.500 --> 02:22:01.740
Oh, well, I've got that coming out. I need to edit it. It goes on Twitter for free. There's going

02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:06.620
to be tons of ear licking content on Twitter because I recorded tons of fun ear licking and

02:22:06.620 --> 02:22:14.940
then it never happened. Day 12, store income. Oh, yeah. Right. Uh, let's very quickly order this.

02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:23.260
Order. Come on. Come on. Come on. I've never restocked harder in my life.

02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:27.420
Come on. Before the customers come in. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's do it. Let's do

02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:33.820
it. Let's do it. Oh, wait. We already have oil. Oh, I need cereal. Why did I buy that? I need

02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:39.660
cereal. Cereal. Do we need bread? Be honest. Do we need bread? No, that's bread there.

02:22:40.220 --> 02:22:46.940
More sugar. I mean, we can just buy whatever at this point then. Oh, open. Open. Quick. Quick.

02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:50.300
Right. Let's buy more bread.

02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:54.220
Oil. Hell yeah. Oil.

02:22:56.380 --> 02:23:03.740
Like I always said, oil. Are you American? Thank you as Richie and Momo as well. There's

02:23:03.740 --> 02:23:08.220
going to be tons that you're licking. I promise. Just let me cook in a week. Let me, there'll be

02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:14.140
so much cooking in a week. You have no idea. Do you call fish? Do you call fish? Do you call

02:23:14.140 --> 02:23:19.660
fish? Sorry. I got, I got effing on my mind because of that freaking storage room thingy.

02:23:19.660 --> 02:23:27.260
Why are you paying so much? Go. At my face. Let her cook what's for dinner.

02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:34.540
I'm a full fish. Wait, what was the statement? I forgot. Do you call fish even have a tongue

02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:39.580
for licking? Eh, not really. It would really be all done by the tentacle of things. But I have

02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:53.260
eight. What the shit? I showed my dad my mech assault stream and he said hi to you all

02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:58.380
whilst we were watching the board. I was like, so those are the reeflands and they all say hi to

02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:07.260
me and we're all having a giggle. He really liked the scene where I was panicking in the

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:13.420
mech assault map where it was like you pretend to be an enemy because you're going to soot

02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:18.860
or basically. He was like laughing at that and he was like reading all your chat and he was like,

02:24:19.500 --> 02:24:24.380
your chat, my chat. Sorry, I'm trying to do it from his perspective. He was reading it and he was

02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:28.220
like, whoa, they're really interactive. And I'm like, yeah, like that's like the fun of streaming

02:24:28.220 --> 02:24:32.140
is like you get to talk live. They get to read your comment because like I explain to him like

02:24:32.140 --> 02:24:42.780
I got explained to him that I got explained to me that when the streamer reads out your comment,

02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:46.780
like it gives you a little serotonin boost. Like you ready? She AFK. She has brain rot. It's over.

02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:50.540
Strong is going to be cooking so much so there's barely going to be any loudest fucking eagle sounds.

02:24:50.540 --> 02:24:55.340
Give me fuel. Give me fire. Give me that witch I desire. Oh, hi pops and we cry when she disappears.

02:24:55.340 --> 02:25:01.820
Hi papa. Oh yeah. What did you think of everyone wanting to marry? He finds it but he loves it.

02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:10.700
He loves it. He has one question for you. Celtic arrangers. You have to pick. That's his question

02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:21.580
for you. Basically. Basically. Yeah. Read mine too. Yeah. Yeah. Take that serotonin.

02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:25.420
Take that serotonin boost. That's right. I'm reading what you're saying. What you can do about it.

02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:31.820
What was the question? Maybe Celtic? Yes. Ah, yes. The ball. I love sports games.

02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:37.580
Exactly. Celtic. Celtic. True. Read mine too. It's a super nice. True. Exactly. Get serotonin boost

02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:42.940
Celtic. Exactly. That's right. Get that serotonin boost. The streamer has said

02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:53.260
Lord give me one more chance. I love that song. It's so good. As if I can do any of that. Get

02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:59.100
serotonin. Get serotonin. Hey you. I want to talk to your manager. The other day when I was here

02:25:59.100 --> 02:26:06.380
you didn't have any cheese. Also the eggs my friends son bought tasted to eggy. Some eggs tasted

02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:12.460
to eggy. Karen your comments about my shop are unfounded and I do not appreciate them. Karen

02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:24.060
please leave your review and go. Thank you so much for the tip. Karen. No way. No way you're on

02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:33.100
another account. I'll buy this place to build a kanzio here. You want to what? I'll buy this place

02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:40.700
to build a casino. You want a casino? No. Gamble bad though. Gamble only good in Baltic. In Baltic

02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:46.780
and Baltral. Why did I say Baltic? Baltic means cold in Scots. It's like oh that's Baltic. That's

02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:54.860
reason. A casino. Oh come on. Come on. Come on. Give customer Greg's son-in-law a chance. Okay he's

02:26:54.860 --> 02:27:00.620
allowed to. Well you never started on a word before or spelt something wrong. How dare you? How dare

02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:05.420
you? You think you're so high and mighty the way you've never started in your life before. I'm

02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:10.540
coming for you. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Get happy. Get happy. Get happy. Gamble is only good

02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:17.340
in gacha games. Baltic. Yeah. It's like oh that's reason. That's Baltic. Is that a Stonia flag?

02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:23.900
Is in the Balkans? No. Is that a Stonia flag? Am I going crazy? I'm sure that's a Stonia flag.

02:27:24.700 --> 02:27:28.620
A Stonia I mentioned. I really hope you're coming for me.

02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:35.020
You think I'm not? You think this is a joke huh? Strip poker. Well it's called sounds like a high

02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:41.820
stakes game. What does that mean? Is that a pun or is that like a sentence? I'm so sorry. I don't

02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:45.740
have my brain on me right now. What's wrong? Couldn't find the cheese. You just bought the cheese.

02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:50.940
Am I going crazy? Rewind the void. Did she not just buy the last cheese and then complain that

02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:59.500
she couldn't find the cheese? Uh, Madame, you are the problem. Right, I'm not going to restock

02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:06.140
because we're going to redirect into Sheepsters doing her VA some more. And then I'm not going to

02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:11.340
play this offline but please don't be surprised if I go nuts for another version of this, like

02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:17.980
another stream of this game. I'm sorry but this gameplay, money go up and then I can unlock a

02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:23.180
refling and I can like sexually harass you at the till and stuff. Like come on, come on. That's

02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:30.220
right, grab that war. Buy my products. You love the store. You love the store. Get off the stage.

02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:38.620
100 bucks. Oh come on, be realistic. Be realistic. You're lucky I can do math. Oh I'm level 10. I

02:28:38.620 --> 02:28:42.060
can hire a refling but I'm not going to have enough money to do it. But we'll do it again, okay?

02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:47.020
I can afford, you can afford a cashier. Well I need to buy the thing as well. I actually,

02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:50.220
you need to buy the cashier and you need to,

02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:57.500
what do I need to, I don't know, I don't know. Oh my god, I'm getting stressed again. There's

02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:02.220
too many customers. Why do you all come at once? I'm getting nervous. I'm getting nervous. Why do

02:29:02.220 --> 02:29:09.420
you all come at once? She says, she said, aha that's what she said. No seriously, why do you all

02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:15.420
pile up? By the last moment please. I'm getting stressed. Thank you for your custom but I'm getting

02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:20.620
stressed. Right there's one more, one more customer and I think we're done. What is it? Oh no it's 8

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:26.860
p.m. There's a whole flock of new customers about to come in. Mummy likes tycoon games. Look, I do.

02:29:26.860 --> 02:29:32.540
You know what game I really enjoy? And literally no one's played it. On the Nintendo DS there's

02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:37.900
this game called Zoo Tycoon and you can like make all the animals happy in it and I adore that game.

02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:41.820
It's like such a simplistic one. I don't know if I can make a stream out of it though. I think it's

02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:46.940
a bit too boring but I love it. Folk leave in their offices there's a lot of them. It's trying to

02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:56.380
get more vague Rievelin. You will be so damn bad for Sukiya. Will I actually be Suika? Suika. Suika.

02:29:56.380 --> 02:30:03.420
Okay Suika. I'm very interested and I have a stream with Azura tomorrow. I'm so excited. I know you

02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:09.820
can't see it but I need to put it up. No change. Thank you for the exact change. What would you like?

02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:14.700
A card? Absolutely my good sir. Thank you. You know you look like that guy that just came in

02:30:14.700 --> 02:30:19.980
two seconds ago. I don't know if you noticed that but hey ho. Caring for animals? I'm sold.

02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:26.380
I play two three games every day. You play a variety of games every day? I like stick to one

02:30:26.380 --> 02:30:31.580
game. I get addicted to one. Like thanks to streaming, unironically I get to play games for the first

02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:41.740
time and just see what I enjoy. In June I got to play a buckshot roulette and that was fun as heck.

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:47.100
I did not expect how fun that was going to be. I am humping my desk for when the multiplayer comes

02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:52.860
out. I'm sorry I'm gyrating. I think we're closed. I think we're closed. Lights out. What a beautiful

02:30:52.860 --> 02:30:59.980
store. I will come back. I hear birds tweeting in game. We'll just have a little

02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:03.260
is that in game or is that real life?

02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:09.580
It may be real life. I'm sorry. It may be real life. There's birds tweeting. I forgot it's morning.

02:31:10.140 --> 02:31:17.180
I forgot. It's 6 a.m. sorry. I just want to take an investigation around here. Is there like

02:31:17.180 --> 02:31:24.700
anything in particular or is it just kind of a map? Hmm it seems to be that. Reef flanks!

02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:30.060
Let me in! Reef flanks! I need my ink supply!

02:31:33.100 --> 02:31:40.940
I start badgering your homes. Wake up! Wake up Reef flanks! Are you squidding me right now?

02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:47.900
Let me in! I find this game boring but you make it entertaining as I got a stroke writing this.

02:31:48.620 --> 02:31:54.460
Oh thank you Momo. I've thoroughly enjoyed this game but I can understand maybe the

02:31:54.460 --> 02:32:00.540
gameplay a bit. Dry cleaners! Wake up! My uniform's dirty because of my reef flanks.

02:32:03.260 --> 02:32:07.660
Only real strongy knocking if you knock eight times. You can knock on random strangers' houses.

02:32:07.660 --> 02:32:12.380
Reef flanks I know you're in there. I didn't realize how big the map is like. Holy moly!

02:32:13.180 --> 02:32:17.900
It's like an eight block. Oh there's a carcass. Uh sir?

02:32:19.580 --> 02:32:24.460
Sir you're causing a carcass. Sir you need to you need to back up. Sir your your your

02:32:24.460 --> 02:32:30.620
suspension's gone. You have no turning. What is going on here? Fresh! Fresh shut the

02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:34.780
shower. At least with baby powder. What are you saying? Oh you're just a number.

02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:39.820
Sir you're literally causing a traffic jam. How am I supposed to get deliveries if you're in the

02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:45.420
