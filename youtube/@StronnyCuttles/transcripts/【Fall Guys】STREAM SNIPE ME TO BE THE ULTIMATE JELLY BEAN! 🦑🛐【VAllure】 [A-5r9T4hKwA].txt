The Fortnite Battle Pass, I just shit on my head
Then I boot it off my PC, cause I need me to get the Fortnite Battle Pass
Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon my little weflins
We are playing this redonkulous game that is known as Fall Guys
Sorry if you had to download the bottom thing cause of me, but thank you for downloading the thing cause of me
This game is called Fall Guys, but we have dubbed it the Jelly Bean Game
Just wanna start off the stream by announcing some terrible fucking news
Oh gee, for any membership stream today, they'll watch longer than 90 the museum
Unfortunately I'm gonna have to reschedule it in a couple of days time
Because I was born with this curse of being a fucking woman
I'm fucking tired and I'm really sick right now, unironically
How did I get you guys in here? Oh fuck it's been so long since I've played this
How did I get you in? Oh no
Is it?
Explore, no I want custom game
I wanna host the custom game, this will create a private lobby, yes
Control, control
Oh right, okay, wait, game selector? Oh no it's been so long
Oh there's too much
Solo, squad, duo, no solo
Oh there's like tons of different freaking game modes
Right how do I get you in? Do I need to do anything?
You guys are connecting? Okay, six, delta, Vigo, five, bravo
Pick solos, okay I have to pick, sorry, sorry
It's been, okay okay it filled up, it filled up right okay
It shows me that we need 40, or it goes as high as 40
Okay, no you're not to let me win, hold on let me go
Of course I've not gone on freaking, see this live chat top chat nonsense
Vigo, yeah, I forgot what V is, vector? I think vector in the alphabet
It's okay, oh it's been a fucking terrible week
I didn't wanna be one of those VTubers that are like I'm a ketchup packet, I'm a fucking ketchup packet
I'm so bloody tired of it, I'm exhausted
Yesterday I was like up ed in the Freya collab, like the subtitles on it
To make the video, and my heart was murmuring away over and over and over
And I'm like you need to calm down, like I'm tired, please
And like I've just woken up and my heart was murmuring again
So I'm currently drinking a fucking fruit smoothie, I've got a cup of tea
I can't play on US servers, no you need to swap to US servers
I mean we can resolve that issue for a while, you'll have to wait until October and then you can do it okay
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Do it for my birthday, how about that
Meow, meow, meow
I'm gonna be learning the controls as you go along
Wait what?
Almost typed the code into the chat because I forgot how controllers were interacted
You're so fucking adorable, oh my god look at my weephins coming in
I can't see you guys yet, I just saw something connecting to the server
I wish, didn't I know I used to like zoom out and show all of us together as you guys were coming in
I'm in, hey yeah
I have hard lag on US servers, I mean it's better than Australian servers
I can tell you that much, if I played Oceanic I would be winning because some of the best
Because of the lag
We all pick the same cosmetics so you can't tell who's you're being, you can see as if you expand the player list
Oh my god it's my free flings
You guys really got Xbox and stuff, oh look I can see if you're on Xbox and who's on game
Like who's on PC
Someone new just came in, oh that's so cool
Oh gee I wonder what my gamer tag is, truly a mystery
It's a jelly beanie
I'm gonna join in a bit, I'm too hungry
We need the glasses assets for reasons, glasses? Oh I don't need my, you want my actual glasses?
You can't see, oh you actually can't see this, what the heck?
Oh they must have changed it, I'm currently in Vtrib Studio opening up the files
So it's not displaying for you
I've got black glasses, heart glasses
I've got green heart glasses, I think I'm green heart glasses
No way I have an old asset, no
I've sun glasses, no wait these aren't glasses
I think I'm just gonna have to go with the green one
Oops my bad
Where the heck is it?
Blue, right G, G-A-V-C-D-E-F-G

Wait how does it already, how does it already know I'm sideways though?
Wait oh my god sorry this is, how does it know I'm sideways?
No, did I do it right?
How is this the best I can do?
Good morning, are you guys at Stony's bread mode where it sounds like a Stan account now?
I tried, is this what you were wanting kinda, oh no it's like blinking with me
Oh that's awful sorry
I just have no luck, wait do I need to make myself bigger and then do it?
Hold on sorry, a giant woman
Hold on, let me try without attaching it to my freaking eyeballs
And then we'll go for game, right
What if it's like sunglasses on?
How does it know I'm already looking sideways?
This is getting freaky honestly
Right and then if I pin it in between
Fuck
I'm not even pinning it to my eyelashes
Why is this so hard?
Right no, no glicks for me, fuck
I can't either, I'm trash
Neglects
Right okay, I'm gonna sit, we're gonna go
I'm gonna make it easier on myself
If I only happen 26 competitors

and they're off honeycombing what are the tactics some reeflings have already jumped below but we

never played the game in my life before you know you can't expect everyone to be perfect right off
the bat come on you need to be realistic me come on here we go chili blogs does not get a f oh he was
having the tactics until he gets pushed down due to the nature of other reeflings coming into play
as he falls down and onto the purple but he cannot go anywhere oh my gosh okay we're on the last layer
warning to reeflings above the last layer has been infiltrated on the hexagon chili blogs leaving
no one alive once he's finished wiping he is mopping up them honeycombs although he finds
himself into a bit of trouble with another reefling jumping down with a second reefling coming
into the fray and three reeflings together coming into the fray at the end but he does make his way

hey strony you like playing with those reflins tell me more what i do i like playing stream
snipe game i already know what game we're playing next week and it doesn't require an install
yeah strony getting sick because fruit's being loved are that was disorientating me
debate news and data to keep watching the stream when i go on a road trip
no no save data for something else i'm just me man i'm just i'm just binchening
honestly paying fall guys with the splatoon ost is the best way to play it i have never
played splatoon maybe i should i don't know if it's because it's an ink game
oh i should have got a custom toggle the inks oh i just go like that and then the screen goes
all black like in mario kart when the ink does this thing rub belly mummy's belly oh wait i'm
alive oh no i have to play on my way wait we can talk to each other how do you do how do you do that
oh sorry i'm not paying attention wait how do you talk on my way i need help
careful of the cannons refling the cannons to the right

figure this out i'm blaming stormy for that first round knockout talking about that alternate
outfit isn't fair lol i had to jump on this am i being pepega no i don't know how to do it
anonymous thank you for the tip version i'm talking about the alternative outfit isn't fair
why you don't like the idea of me sitting on you shocking i want to do i want to get a comic strip
where i accidentally sit on you and i have no idea where you went and you're like obviously on my boat
you can check what the key findings are how dare you suggest something so smart
if you like games with ink i suggest you pay bendy and the ink machine
is that a real game or did you just make that up that sounds like a made-up game
oh you like ink that's right go play schwaubelmobel and the ink machine thank you veal or lover for
the super chat oh it's a real game okay what kind of game it's a horror game
oh no i mean i have a heart rate monitor and i have a uh shock collar on the way
um i've i've asked if any of the girls want their uh if any of the girls want my shock collar
um we have scrumptious night we have leo ink we have chair we have dust fantasy god king air
solely oh no something like that doody uh sit and ink and that's how rooflings are i've missed
one i think apparently um yes i have heart rate monitor now i also have a shock collar um i have
a very interesting shock collar stream coming up um i'll be a slight blast to the past for a few years
but um the punishment is if i lose i have to shock myself i had to get a freaking dog collar
because obviously a dog collar isn't gonna fucking ask for your buddy ip address location name
date of birth and all that whereas like this fucking chinese one did um so i've said to the girls
i was like if anyone wants the shock collar for content i'll send it to you but just warning
you that it takes your data and like the app takes your data as well and um yeah basically
that's the trade off if you want a free collar you unfortunately have to give this app your thing
but yeah i yeah the only thing i could get was a dog collar because it's not gonna ask for my
freaking ip address um why does it take your data uh china is set up a bit differently
like if you ever order anything from china you have whoa
this song is so good sorry the whole thing just died off there we've got three leaflings left
oh i'm sorry i've jinxed it oh okay well taken strong in front of all kids
i feel like emi would love it emi's already got one shibi's already got one so i don't
know if ac0 or mersey want to if they don't want it it's getting shoved in the bin but yeah china's
goods are kind of set up slightly different from our usual wait you don't trust the chinese communist
i'm like why the heck um why the heck that i have to give you a phone number to zap myself
remotely and um i was like looking into the app and it scrubs all your personal data it like scrubs
your phone contacts and stuff and i'm like no why would i need that to administer a little bit of
shocky poos on myself no yeah literally thousand minus thousand social credit unironically though
i can't imagine shibi shocking herself emis but not shibi i thought shibi already got one
shibi already she bought the same one that i've got or i've got the same one that she got
do you not want an extra 300 to your social credit score for boosting the economy
we've already sold my private data it's already gone there's some guy called jimping that's terrible
sorry that was a bad joke everything needs an app nowadays the data harvesting is real if it's free
you're the product yeah i still had to pay for the software so wamp wamp or is it hardware sorry
wamp wamp stroney do you want to hear a german doc oh dark joke steady on dem stay down
stroney it's the feds we've determined from the way you've been using your shock collar that you
may be involved in terrorist activity excuse me what did he say thank you dem stay down for the
super chat that way i have to thank you for that uh how long you be streaming and i have another hour

who makes these songs for this game it's insane sorry but it's like actually good i'm i don't
want to say kids game this is actually good music i managed to dodge the monthly debuff by
respecting into the woman glass later in the game oh what does that mean my respect in
that's funny as fuck we will say it as many times as it uh-huh we want you to take care of your
health more than we want membership streams you already quadruple the typical amount of streams
members get i'm still blown away like people don't do that much change goods and services
thank you miss morgan for the spec is actually such a good thing uh rilke kadmus thank you
no thank you for understanding i don't want to be weird about it but i'm like rough i get really sick
when i so obviously i've streamed from who goes about is like food not everyone
mate you're done iron repert you're done thank you for the tip you're done no more you're done
you're done because you're gonna start me on a tinfoil hat rant
i was something with a sentence like that i'm gonna start me on a tinfoil hat rant what if i told you
you know that's the whole point like you stream for one week 10 hours per day because you're crazy
i don't know why you feel bad i guess it's just like because i know my dad's um getting here very
soon like then it really will be like i can't i can't be like right let's play only two hours of
baltrow wink wink and then end up with five hours like i know i can't do that when he gets here
and it's going to be like that for a little while like oh my god is there someone called day
worst player over there oh no notorious or your chithulu oh no you're literally called yourself
day worst player all this is that we can finally catch up on the vod back logs oh honestly
like last time it's really fucking actually sorry this is me just going on a rant about
being a woman in general it's really annoying because one month ketchup season can not be that
bad and then another like this month for example i'm like completely knocked on my ass like i feel
so ill um like literally my wee heart can't it it doesn't feel good like i don't feel well
i feel lightheaded i feel sick or that and then like the next thing i'll just be like no it's fine
i was like oh okay then because like i literally obviously i streamed for the full month in june
um so i streamed you know during that time and like i was absolutely fine and you wouldn't even
be able to tell what stream i was on you know you know what i'm saying i've heard that can affect it
too if you don't get enough iron yes i basically eat steak once a month to try and replenish my
iron so i get to have steak so at least um my dad's gonna cook it for me i'm sorry but i like
well done steaks i said what i said dinny give me a raw steak dinny give me a blue steak that
hangs that hangs still breathing if you give me a blue steak that's disgusting that's disgusting
okay we're here for well done steaks uh i am caveman eat meat okay caveman eat meat understand
go medium that thing is raw but that that still has eggs from the worms inside it no well done
eliminates any doubt of that sauce but um and it is i need to stay plump you know the booty cheeks
have to be clapable at any moment moment for you when you when you clap into me i want you to be
able to hear clap clap medium 140 kills the eggs yeah and you know what well done does
absolutely just does that delicious this worms just give it texture do not take for the next 10
seconds do you understand me beefling for making me read that out loud strony you're the one that's
done you're done no you're well done wait is this christmas map this is a christmas map
overnight oh my god i can't wait to spend christmas with you it's gonna be so fun
and everything well done makes it tough though i don't mind the chewing i think if you get a
good steak it doesn't really chew like that oh the charcoal gives it texture charcoal like a grill
cookie baking stream you want a bacon stream i can do a bacon stream i've got a really interest
in handcam a some more street who won no way the two-time champion chair you did it twice
congrats that was a full finish that was fantastic
is the steak not grilled it's in a pan question mark a bacon oh you want me to just make bacon
on the stream you don't want like i don't know cookies or something i'll just let you know that
rare medium and all that crap was just an excuse for restaurants to turn out food faster
cooking steak well done yet jussie is an art yeah literally gg of course you're saying gg won
handcams are quite good yes i have a very interesting handcam asmr stream i'm very
interested to see how it's received and i might do a membership asmr which is a bit more
annoying i wouldn't mind cooking streams oh god keep strong oh let's go boil mash them stick
them in a stew i can show you my washing board and my cutting board well i totally didn't buy a
cutting board that literally says boil mash them stick them in a stew well i have a hobbit cut well

oh my brain does not work like that there's no way i would have gotten anywhere near points in this
i mean you could browse those spectators and name them yourself i don't know who's the part of
whose team though which is why it'd be impossible to give you his name gotta remember which tells
of the fruit you should play mario car it's a 12 game uh i suck at mario car um the new versions
of mario car i can't play but if you want to roll me in the game absolutely i'm more than
happy to play mario car but there's no way in heck i'm winning i don't know how it works
i was cheating last time and i was oh i was getting used to hold back um
um just so i can win oh there you go two squads we're in the last squadron
what's it gonna be
hexagon i've not got a switch we still qualify let's go
oh what refling team will be stan left standing is the question and none other than the most
recognizable game hexagon oh it's funny how they don't face you to each other
now we do have to work as a team without sabotage on the board too much because you have friends
so you can't just be going all willy nilly or else you're gonna perish
day worst player might be in for a good player reward i don't know what i was trying to say
there let's try so you might be thinking squady is taking a very interesting tactic and destroying
a layer that the others have yet to reach
hmm seems like we're quite populated up here there's a lot of reeflings on the yellow we're
starting to fall down though you'll never guess what the hexagons are almost gone
oh okay okay okay look i'm not a commentator i'm just doing my thing
so they're killing each other friends this weakness leaving the body what are you
are you perishing your teammates you're not supposed to hurt your teammates
friends what friends just a miserable little pile of secrets those wengas oh i don't know that
reference now there are three reeflings who are already on the lowest layer
hmm
hmm
lay wink is trying to take out tiny spiny me so i don't think they're actually
wait did they just take themselves out i think they just took themselves out
solid blake is the only survivor of his team cookie fumbler and tiny spiny might actually
take themselves out they are a part of the same take same team as nonism sorry i get so intense um
cookie fumbler is just absolutely going through the hexagons not really maximizing his time with them
the winners are the worst player solid blake parallaxian and lewain congrats on the winners

false and wrong get super chad get super chad get super chad she's so cute when she's excited
i just think it's the best map literally i get to slip and slide on my belly that's so fun
stroney's wildly good at that one that's probably why i like it so much like oh i can actually win
the worthy gig uh the worthy gig is when you put your uh is what you put your clothes on
to dry outside and it spins in a circle with the wind the game cheated and knocked me off
map okay it keeps putting me in the same team danny i'll restart the lobby because it's putting me
in the same team and i want a chance for like everyone to try and have a chance to be in the same team
i was not paying attention for that to happen
oh my god i think i'm about to throw up oh no it was a burp it was a burp it's fine
out out stop it out stop it right let's recalibrate
okay wow we made it there is a teammate that's ahead thank goodness
because i am i am not doing so good
oh surely i can make it okay okay we made it we've got a checkpoint okay look okay okay okay
oh okay i'll take it i'll take it no it was a speed boost it was a positive okay it's a positive
okay let's
okay it's fine i did oh i don't want to win any i don't want to be first place you
know i have to give the other reeflings a chance you know like i just i gotta give the reeflings
a chance sorry my controller about to suck and get open in the settings menu don't worry
throwing up on stream would definitely be a first hey mommy got warmed i got walloped honestly
wow did we make it oh no we didn't make it but that's okay right i'll reset the next lobby
because i don't think it's swapping the teams unless it is swapping the teams and
i'm just getting really weird luck is it swapping the teams for you guys yes or no
yes or no no it's not swapping it's not swapping okay okay i reset the lobby after this one
and we'll get a new lobby code it isn't i'm in the same team as last okay okay i am learning
doordish avoid the fake doors can the reeflings avoid the fake doors is the question will we
spectate it's you oh okay we've got some leader reeflings all the way at the front
somehow you're ahead of everyone oh well i jinxed it i'm sorry i jinxed it i'm so sorry
hey we got it we got it oh it's a one in five four in five three in five
does it just get less and less this one's so good for you to watch everyone just
head button doors
okay i like this one
oh let's see what teams get there oh level over these perv reeflings in slow motion didn't
make it have some studying to do for a test good luck on your test gambati do your best
and something something if you chew gum whilst you study and then chew gum during the test your
brain will connect the two doors i don't know if that's true or not but yeah that one is the
ultimate rng but yeah like i like when it's up to chance and not skill
my squad is on it let's go this one is it is avoid the thick doors can't avoid mommy's
thick doors i don't think i've ever had my butt cheeks described as a thick door before
oh yeah you want to open this door open them oh it's the fruit one careful
okay you're gonna make oh god this one kind of makes me a bit motion sick
you're simply gambling addictive look all i'm gonna say is that belcher was really fun
but if you get sucky runs it sucks the soul out of you but as soon as you get a good run
you get all the endorphins i don't think i can spectate i'm not being funny that's like
legit giving me illness i'm like focusing on chatting said i threw so hard oh don't worry
it's just funny games thank you for playing we're gonna reset the lobby so we get different teams
maybe not a door but like a giant gate castle castle gale shawnee got them elden ring doors
she's stop i know exactly what animation you're referring to when you open up like a door to
something mommy i am seeing starfish is are you getting motion sick too
man i wasn't paying attention i got eliminated oh sorry don't worry we still have time for
more more more i'm actually really enjoying the squads i'm sorry i'm a sick for it i like being
like oh i've got my wee team and i don't have to rely on myself fully when you get sucky runs
it sucks so hard but when you win it's all then okay so gambler right okay yeah gambler
do any of the teams sentence ought to be balanced no we're gonna have to reset the lobby because
it's not like shawkin is about i've been able to get passed around since we did teams i suck
oh you're too sweet strutting what do you mean we're just playing video or am i being dumb
i like squads because i like the feeling of carrying yeah that's why i like being carried
that's why i like squads oh my god we're a match made in heaven rieflin
mommy you made like the first descent as a game wow i've never heard of it
okay now i can actually watch the gameplay because i was gonna be violently ill oh it's
rainos again stomping grand need to be passed around we stand as soon as i get eliminated
chair is still in the run uh we're still got there's still three teams left
oh my god
how do we not spectate recon reform we don't spectate you much do we
no pressure the whole the stream's watching you recon reefling no pressure at all smile
oh first descent is a free third person futuristic sure you want me to want to show
are you gonna see my aimball sure just being very supportive even when you're eliminated
it's so sweet i just i just think it's fun getting to play with all the reeflings
i i like stream sniping i don't have any problem with that i think it's fun like um i wanted to
play apex but apparently people hate apex and i'm like oh it's a shame because like i get to
talk to you in voice chat but i don't know if that puts people off so i just play safe i hope
i hope you play ultra kill i'm pretty sure um azura is playing ultra kill at the moment
i have no idea what the game is about oh two squads left and one that only has three members
my squad through
i'd watch apex couldn't pay me to play it not even if i was on your team we can go into salt
lake city servers because no one plays on that and then it's just us everybody's watching
did a scarier i got knocked out a few rounds ago time for me to choke
look why why did it why does it all grip you in a team and like put you together
are you squidding me right now um anon
strongy is legit slim thick a small figure with sexy hips and cheeks to clap
thank you kindly anon don't mind if i do get my ego stroked what's going on here
stroking my ego while you stroke here so i'm on to you anon thank you
you have 70 days on apex uh carry me question mark i was gonna do drunk apex but i'm not
allowed to go offline until we win and you guys would have to carry me to win that's the only
problem uh but then i was like oh people don't like apex i don't know if people are gonna be weird
about it but like a valorant has teams of five so i could have four reflands with me overwatch
two has four reflands with me apex i can only have two reflands with me wait when you're gonna
play cod with the girls yay yeah when the uh i don't know what cod it was i think cod is a black
up six is coming out or something i was gonna play it with the girl the gorals so just the never
ending stream um destiny two rates sadly i've never played destiny i don't know what it's about i'm not
very good uh but you'd have a full lobby of reflings and apex yes it would be a private lobby on apex
and you would all join the code and then god this game is not getting easier
i talk about a skirt in the rim holy crap wow
oh this is they need a zoom out option held out verse two has a friend system that works well
from playing with refunds unless it breaks i'd give hell divers to a shot apparently it's player
base is dead though after the sony shenanigans congrats ruin desolation zero fu and sassafras

shock collar also i'd like to make a bet that you start whimpering in a cute way when you feel the
shock we might help you discover a new fetish hang on steady on and the shock collar is planned
two weeks the actual shock collar stream i'm to use on and
and if it goes well i mean i can use it in general like see we play elton ring and then like we die
when we go against a boss i can shock myself like that now i'm thinking of this damn whoever said that
thank you anon for the tip um i would say it's probably two weeks away i just ordered it

terrible terrible influence on one another wow we can't get away from stomping ground i'm ready
to delete it and put it in the bin rhinos rhinos rhino skirt
literally we can't get away from these rhinos is it that common of a map or are we just getting unlucky
okay how many teams it looks like four teams yeah four teams left get luck replaying have a go each
other oh one's already off the map sorry a little reflinger who we don't speak to you
we're not speaking to you no pressure chad no pressure everyone's watching you

the rhinos were constantly invoking you
strony have you completed elton ring the base game i have once before
with the help of many but i did do it that's the main thing i did do it even though i had
help i did do it so i have played the game i haven't finished the dlc though um i don't
even know how little or far we're into the dlc uh last thing i remember was we found this flower
place and there was a guy on a horse and we beat him up and then there's another guy on the horse
and beat him up as well but we had to whack him a few times oh you're playing volleyball
oh where's the ball oh come on replays you can do it there is one point scored already
uh if i recall you're about halfway yeah we defeated the lion
horse man in flower place is optional
um we did try and get the guy that turns into a snake but he got the best of us so
um i think we're just kind of exploring i don't know if we'll go back to base game
or not i'm unsure but someone gave me a special crossbow that goes
uh so i'm helping to get the the enemy a little bit in Elden Ring i'm going
oh that volleyball does not want to go down
wow
i remember only you laughing so much while some reefling was trying to kill it did with
the big sword but this should be like every moment of the stream so it's just so sorry
i was laughing at a reefling
wait this snake guy picking up a reefling was i laughing and nervousness because he was getting
rolled to complete weapon upgrades the base game would be helpful yeah i think i need to do that
problem oh no you did everything right i think you did everything right anyway
mommy getting the enemy to bleed with the full auto crossbow what a fumble honestly the game's so like

animation and now i want something whoa wait why are you standing in the corner
what is this what do you do
is your goal to finish the keypad together
oh wow no way you guys are smart enough to do that how do you know
no way that's so smart sorry that's actually so smart
oh we're making a few mistakes so we're getting there
whoa oh my god i love this i want to play this one i'm going to ask the question every
reefling wants to know but is too afraid to ask does strongly like a reeflings ink salty or sweet
i like it anyway it comes thank you i don't for the tip if it comes from a reefling
i'll take it doesn't matter the quality the condition
if it's reefling ink i want it do you understand i want it
why are you doing it reeflings look at the monitor to know what you need to make
it's so funny to see the lag because like one reefling would be like i'm helping
and then it's like destroying it
mommy has an ink tax oh the only kind of tax i'll accept
this is strong and you've got to be saying stuff like that when i'm helping my team
oh maybe i should do that next time so we can win
my teammates are not allowed to leave the mute stream for two minutes and then i just say the
most absolute veil things i want to do to you
oh reefling are you still sleeping oh you just stay asleep mommy just needs to help herself okay
oh it's the christmas map
that's so evil but effective well i mean my team isn't up anymore so oh we got a little love heart
hello hello let's do it let's do it let's do it
man this is unfair i like it did the room just get 10 degrees warmer
go reeflings go go reeflings go go reeflings go you can do it
okay maybe don't do that that was dangerous you do you're doing again you're doing again
that's so dangerous little reefling
oh god a tent got made you're welcome
oh wait i don't know i don't know if french means cringe or not
but to say you're welcome in french you say yapat qua
stronti's secret cheat me locating the blood of the reeflings to the lore huh
i'm wondering should i just do that mommy will there be a drinking game with us yes
i've not decided what the drinking game will be
yeah next week we're doing puzzles because it's nice and calm and quiet
but i get to hate the image
and then you guys get to come into the puzzle and then we do the puzzle together
inking cube the blood knows where it just needs to go man
let me just play drunk souls drink whenever you die to a boss
i mean if you want drunk elden ring sure i don't mind whatever game you want to play
is buckshot roulette a puzzle that would be a fun buckshot roulette is going multiplayer so we
could maybe do stream sniping and that if i pray i'm like 100 sure the creator of buckshot roulette
said that there was going to be like public access lobbies for streamers um which would be
insane trying to like figure out what's going on all of us point and be like no you should
uh yourself no you should uh yourself stronti no you'll perish did you just fart am i going crazy
did i just hear a fart in game did i make that up i'm going schizophrenic yeah who do we know
okay noob lord we don't normally spectate you a little egg plant
speaking of farting that's not far that's a loaf of bread hold on a minute there'll be no
fart in here it's latex creaking it's not a two oh okay i didn't know i was could have sworn
i was like why did they randomly put fart dot mp3 in the middle of this oh no wait are you
doing fine okay it's just your connection sorry i can't look too long on this map for some reason
it goes from a motion signal i only get motion sickness in a car though i'm not in a freaking
video game like i've never normally experienced it in a video game but i think because the camera
keeps spinning in a circle we're baking a loaf out here aren't you guys always baking a loaf i
thought guys like pooped multiple times a day aren't you all making loaves right now you have a
morning loaf of bread then you have a night loaf of bread damn i got triple grabbed man reeflings
are feeling a bit randy today clearly if we're all grabbing rubbing instead
not really no i think guys apparently poop multiple times a day that was a real gropey
we are not careful he's usually one loaf of bread a day i made it so far and all the time
how long will today's stream be um i was technically supposed to be wrapped up by now
i'll give a few more rounds okay and then i'll um i'm gonna go get a bath just to try and
feel a bit better i whatever you do reeflings don't be a girl that's all i'm gonna that's all i'm
gonna say okay depends on how much celery we end up having a few more rounds hey yo wait i just got
the joke a few oh you want a few more rounds it depends how much celery you have for me

someone really is reliving the old school days oh no remember the teacher would be like oh you can
just buddy up with me and i was like i always got i always got buddied up with the bad kids
because i used to do all the work i think it was just easier for the teacher to be like oh they're
not going to be disruptive if they're with stroney so you heard mommy don't run mommy does the countdown
exactly i'm going to fail someone no no don't put that on your you're going to try your best for

we tried our best when you try our best but you don't succeed
that was so good i'm not like i'm not upset or anything that was so good i got mounted by mommy
i'm so sorry about no that was funny big apologies to my teammate no you tried your
best that's the main thing um it's h to ask for a piggyback on pc okay it's too hard to
carry straw day honestly though okay you don't have to do the piggyback thing you can just go
for it now you can just run go reflings go check this out okay what we're checking you out
what refling was that was it you that said check this out i think oh right well we checked out for
a little bit i thought the piggybacking thing was fun yeah if i'm in the round i'll force you
to piggyback but if i'm not in the round then you don't have to do it either i got sabotaged
i don't know how to make someone else figure i don't know it seems really i like press up on
the d pad and i think the other person has to press up but we can cancel each other out by
accident okay carrying strawnee with those on your back must be both distraction and motivating
honestly i wish the jelly beans could have a little bbl i'd buy that cosmetic i don't care
sure i'd buy the the afo that cosmetic
oh there's only a few eliminations that that was like what six
wow person who pressed it forces the one who gets carried okay we're learning we're learning
if we piggyback you you can whisper in our ears it's okay refling keep going you're doing so good
keep it up faster faster you're almost there keep going and just something bbl oh that was the
question i reflin asked on um on marshmallow they were like you always say your butt is bigger you
got a bbl is it natural i'm like yeah it's natural it's complete luck because i'm small in height
the the fat has to go somewhere and it picked my thighs and butt but i think because i ride a bike
as well it kind of shaped my like where my fat distribution goes and it resulted in like a good
like uh butt hip ratio type thing
are you sweating reflin your breathing is pretty hard right now
short stacked goblin core cuttlefish honestly i'm not being those allegations i'm tiny
um i thought i was normal size to be honest like height wise but apparently not
apparently i'm a teeny weeny are you trying to keep us distracted because you've achieved it
haha some people are born lucky oh i'm not literally it's complete luck like uh it's not like
i'm trying to like build my body to look a certain way or anything like that like no i sit
on my arse all day long i do walks and i ride a bike that's about it
strontius carry size okay i'll take that that's a compliment burning the thigh fat with the leg
workout so but power remained if mummies on her back and it comes to a full finish we'd
win with the extra inches get oh that is so funny stop that's hilarious your little jelly bean
wiener on the full finish strontius just fun sized yeah the ring game always stresses me out
we're watching lily lily lily lily lily lily we've got parallaxation lee wink regi zero
