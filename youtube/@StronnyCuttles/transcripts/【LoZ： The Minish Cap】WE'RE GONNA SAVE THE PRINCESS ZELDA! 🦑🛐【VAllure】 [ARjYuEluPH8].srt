1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Wow...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Tasting, tasting...

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My voice is sharp before any...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, get excited!

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Testing...

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Microphone test...

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ah ah, microphone, okay.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Audio is a freaking thing.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh yeah, it's streaming time.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Are you guys there?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Testing...

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, YouTube gave me acknowledgement I'm live.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello...

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Good morning!

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good evening!

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Good afternoon!

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How are my little wiflings?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Very very sweet!

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No one is going to get that reference.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Good morning!

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How are you?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm currently glowing because of the events that occurred last night.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
After a stream that should not be named.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You guys had some very interesting marshmallows for me when I woke up.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I do have some good tiny VLR news.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
AC and Emmys second batch of emotes have been accepted and paid for.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So do hold your breath for them.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The girls picked what emotes they want and they were very charming.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think they're adorable.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Up next is ordering Sheevee and Mersi's emotes.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm having to do it in batches.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The wait time is 30 days.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But as soon as they've been accepted it's just something in the background that I don't have to think about.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which is fantastic.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I am submitting my emotes last because I know how ever so patient my beautiful wiflings can be.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I do appreciate your patience until the new emotes do show up.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We are getting there.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We will soon be there.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will do that later.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My voice is short unfortunately but hopefully the microphone is covering up the majority of how badly short it is.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And I think we're just going for it.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We will wait as long as it takes.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think ours are going to show up in like 40 days which is quite a lot.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Considering how much mome streams.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll be a whole second but I mean I see their emotes have been submitted and I get to see the adorable drafts.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The mot artist has already worked on them before so it might be a faster process.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Question mark.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I submitted to them the ref sheet.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They're all the emotes and what they want here.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Time to diminish.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No we are going to save.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have a cup of tea.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've got a hot war ball.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I may or may not have slapped myself a little too hard but I hope.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That phantom we saw earlier.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He said he had an ancient king of Hyrule.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What else do we know?

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The element was nowhere to be seen in the wind runes.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I guess we'll just have to go to the place marked on our map.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But first you should infuse your sword with that element.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right okay.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We have just picked up the third element.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The element of water.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh the light.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The skulls open up.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hello.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I knew this was here for a child.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah someone was so adorable in message and they were like mome.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm like yeah.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They were like mommy.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What hole did you use?

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
My refund.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Bless you.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hope.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brained where are you?

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Did my language not unfair?

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where are we going?

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I was going to say swimming pool.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hi Sony what's the transformers last night?

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is this one I've ever had watching a movie?

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh I'm so glad.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I actually love doing watch-alongs.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Especially like on stuff I've never seen before.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Fucking hell it's going to take forever.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm lucky I picked up a bomb sack honestly.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't read the site from Marshmallow.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have no clue.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you use firefox there should be a little extension for translation.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Unfortunately I don't use anything else but firefox.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But I think you can all translate if you try hard enough.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wait I can't...

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can't do anything can I?

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can only get this.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well oh well we got 100 for that.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh we can go buy an upgrade on something.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah we cannot do anything.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There's something to the bomb we can do unfortunately.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not sure what that is.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're currently just exploring because we've got access to the...

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh no they're having to do a time crunch.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Chomp chomp.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm always the last to finish eating.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh can't really...

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How about you do you...

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No no trading.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oops.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We're dying.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We are very...

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We are getting very close to finishing the game.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
As far as I'm aware.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't have that yet grrr.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Alright we can come back another time.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh there's a big guy up there.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go get him.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Shonen's always a fed gopher.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's just let them have people eat slow.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You made it here really quickly.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're filled with surprises aren't you?

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It took me like one third of the game.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But sure if you mean getting here quickly.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There you go.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's so cute.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That looks like...

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No one wants to trade Kinstone pieces either.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And here my food I've got stuff to do.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Bruv honestly.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hello thanks everyone for joining.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am not going to even pretend I know what's going on with the schedules.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Some people will be online.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Some people will be offline.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's it. That's all I know.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't ask me anymore because I don't know.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What do you say?

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You've played this before.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I have. This is a lovely childhood game of mine.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh we can give these girls houses.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Who do we think is the best here?

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do we do the green bunches?

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Come on green bunches.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah give us green bunches.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No there's something really annoying about this little side quest we're about to do okay?

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There will always be one girl that doesn't have a house because they didn't call to end.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's annoying.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Shira Fanta Fusion Ward.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well I've just had the best idea.

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can rent out my house for some extra cash.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No not long lords simulator.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We can't escape.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You've made a perfect match.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Singing in forever. What a bother.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's so nice to be here at last.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We need to find a place to quiet and down.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's so nice to be here at last in such a big townhouse.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Are these maybe they're a reference to another Zelda game?

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So now he can rent out but we need to find someone.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What do you want? Why are you bothering me?

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh my name is Gorman. I'm trying to hand in real estate.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Turns out I'm a total pain.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's a total pain right now.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm looking for a 10 and you see the thing is I can only rent to a wimp.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you guys remember that reddit post that went semi viral?

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Where the guy was like looking for a roommate.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But you wouldn't have to pay if you're a woman.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You'd just have to give up the goods basically.

168
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah I don't know if you guys remember that but I do.

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And it was pretty wild.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You found me a house yesterday. Go rent.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh I remember that.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay I knew I wasn't the one that knew about it.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That was legit. It was pretty nice.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right we actually can get access to the rooftop now.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Once we pick up the last item we're going to do a massive amount of exploring.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Because you want to make sure you get naturally due.

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is that supposed to be the lead? No it's not.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So my update last night.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah last night I was doing my research about this game.

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No chance. I don't think I can play sub six and make it interesting.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm going to be honest. I don't think I can make it interesting.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Strongest, strongest, strongest explorer.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh does he want to teach me anything here?

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hello.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Come again when you can jump further.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I never believed Sivir's your kind of game.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It would be fun to just be like scorching it but...

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Wait is this going to give me like 50 bombs then?

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's a big bomb bag.

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well you are a big spender thank you.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It does! It gives me 50 so I'm going to have 50 arrows as well.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay okay.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I assume the shield doesn't actually give me...

195
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You already have a fine shield.

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah I was going to say.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We already have one I'm not sure.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No one seems to want to fuse Kinstone pieces.

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Have I like done everyone?

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think I might have done everyone in town.

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Strongest big spender and she can handle deposit.

202
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hope you're having a good day.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah I'm having a cheeky slow morning.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I've got my cup of tea.

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm just letting it cool down a little bit.

206
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We'll go at the Castello and upgrade our equipment.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We can...

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh look at that.

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Zoom in.

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Absolutely zoom in.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think it would be...

212
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a group club idea.

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They do an endurance club by each other and so...

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Unfortunately the girls can't do that because they need to move out.

215
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or their parents are going to come flying in the room and be like,

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Shut up!

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I love hedges!

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I love gardening!

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's saving me from the snake!

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's kind of the problem.

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's why I'm always like,

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Please support the girls because we have plans of moving to better locations and stuff.

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I knew gardening would pay off.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
How long is stream today?

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It depends how much time we piss off about.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wow!

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I actually don't know how much longer.

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Lore-wise?

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We only have one more item to unlock.

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You're in presence of the true master, Grimblade.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you train me, you become a master.

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Would you like to train?

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes please.

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I think we've only got like four more hours of gameplay.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
To learn the meaning of the power of this technique,

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you start with first, second, third.

238
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah, sure.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I was listening.

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But this is only the beginning.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It comes to real thing.

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You must feel the technique.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's why I will never possess your body.

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
With the Grimblade possession technique.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Watch this!

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Position!

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No, I think it will be like four hours.

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh wow, I can like shoot.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You must try it yourself.

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
When you're...

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, that's such a good thing.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh.

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No way!

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I just like straight up have a laser beam now.

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Do you teach me anymore?

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You're awesome.

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Can you teach me more?

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
No, there's nothing more I can teach you.

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But that's pretty cool.

260
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If I'm full health, I have a bullet now.

261
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Possession.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We refuse this forbidden stream allegation.

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh my god.

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't want to know the allegation.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Them allegunkns.

266
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I was outrageous that stream.

267
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But for anyone that gets annoyed with me going

268
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
bit, bit, bit for all the bees.

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I visit her every hour to have much to offer

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
but you're welcome to stay.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Stop!

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
They're so cute and humble.

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The stream didn't even get limited ads

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
even though the context of the stream

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
is absolutely outrageous.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, the falling trees up.

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can visit the Swordmaster at the lake.

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Did I not?

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Did we not go back?

280
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I thought we went back.

281
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
YouTube ads are such a working system.

282
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you guys getting ads?

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I told them not to put them on stream.

284
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Wah!

285
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, well, I can definitely go to that lake right now.

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What?

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
She's trying to gain it.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Right, so we basically just don't,

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
just don't get caught by the AI.

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know how severe it is

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
or if it's like accessible.

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Wah, it doesn't seem too bad.

293
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Um...

294
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Who even gets bothered by the bees?

295
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, literally, if you're considering,

296
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
like, with a hook or something like that.

297
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Here?

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That doesn't seem right.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Woah!

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No way I did that!

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Wait, is there a hidden-

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, okay, let's definitely do the hidden stuff first.

303
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm shooting my laser beam!

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh my god, this is so OP!

305
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Sorry, but actually...

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What is here?

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, I went the right way.

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I went the right way.

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Uh...

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
She's charging my laser.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The laser's also two times your sword damage.

312
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you winning, Strunnion Chat?

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yeah, we're infusing the third element!

314
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
We now are adding the water element to the sword.

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Which is fantastic.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't have my blanket and I'm

317
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
killing the circulation in my leg.

318
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's my pure accident.

319
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't have access to my alternative Twitter.

320
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But I hope that audio did well.

321
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The power of the element allows you to

322
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
split into three copies now.

323
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's cute.

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We're winning when Strunnion is on the screen.

325
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There we go, just like that!

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The audio was Ace here.

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What is it?

328
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I was like, oh, it's so cringe.

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Like, I struggle so much to talk when I'm like that.

330
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I was just like...

331
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Please read me out.

332
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I was the best I got.

333
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I couldn't do it anymore.

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay, glad you're in.

335
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Ah, frickin', not to be...

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yikes, my nerve.

337
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Sorry, I just woke up.

338
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No, I didn't.

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I didn't.

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, you gave me money.

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I didn't get demonetized.

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's what it's saying for people who

343
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
like hate when I go like burger bing-boot,

344
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
but it's babas bing-boot.

345
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The reason why I brought it up is because

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
we didn't get...

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Gammy, stop it.

348
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Not again.

349
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We didn't get demonetized.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But thank you for the tip.

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Thank you for the super chat.

352
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Was there something under here?

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There it was.

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Burger bing-boot, that is.

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The bath we knew won.

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We knew won.

357
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We're doing it.

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't know what we're doing,

359
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
but we're doing it.

360
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We're not jumping down.

361
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We probably should go gambuzzle shells soon.

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do you think, Link?

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Pretty dark and spooky, isn't it?

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Makes you want to cry, doesn't it?

365
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You're not scared?

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, neither am I.

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Come on, let's go.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm actually going to chug my tea.

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I do apologize.

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Tell you what, we'll go to Hyrule

371
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
because it sounds a bit more nice.

372
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The background ambiance in Hyrule is a bit nicer.

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let me just slurp this tea.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But thank you, Broly Legends99 underscore.

375
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're getting very specific with the names here.

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We're on an adventure.

377
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Big Ben Zershin.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I have no clue what this is.

379
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Like Big Bilbo Baggins.

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Like Big Bilbo Baggins, Big Plugs.

381
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Like Toys, that kind of thing.

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Algo has no close stroneas.

383
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm architect.

384
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh, no, you can say architect

385
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
because it just sounds like architecture.

386
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Don't forget to take them in if you haven't.

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh, I'm already hired, okay.

388
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I changed my wind.

389
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
She's gone, lads.

390
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The Vietnamese fucked me up real good

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
but they also have really good food

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
so I'll allow this discretion

393
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
that has been against me

394
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
via the Vietnamese.

395
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But I forgive you, Vietnamese lady

396
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that destroyed my toe.

397
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yeah, I changed it.

398
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Healing very beautifully.

399
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm very happy to say

400
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it doesn't look like there's any sign of infection.

401
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Doesn't smell like that.

402
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Not getting any indication.

403
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I get to put a salt bath for it very...

404
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think in five, well, four days

405
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to soak away what I can.

406
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
They said you can use hot water

407
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and swirl it around

408
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
but it's a bit too sensitive

409
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
for that at the moment.

410
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'd rather not.

411
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I'll do a salt bath shortly

412
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
but we're healing nicely.

413
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Things are looking good.

414
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The painkillers are painkilling.

415
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And life is good.

416
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I've got a few shorts

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
of the girls coming on the way

418
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
which I'm excited about.

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm going to put some

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
cheeky advertisement money into

421
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
as I always do.

422
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Mercy's short.

423
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I thoroughly enjoyed

424
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Shout out to the editor.

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They just applied themselves

426
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
on the website

427
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and they turned out to be

428
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
exactly what I was looking for.

429
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Edit and style and all.

430
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And they've never complained

431
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
about any of the edits either.

432
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I love me.

433
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I love me an edit and slave

434
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that doesn't complain about work.

435
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I love it when you guys

436
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
still complain

437
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and I get to put you at work.

438
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But he edited Mercy's

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Senpai Should I Be Blonde

440
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and I've got everyone

441
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
to do a version of that.

442
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm about to send that off.

443
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh no.

444
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Strony's removed Tony on chat.

445
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
No.

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm still here watching mommy.

447
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Are you watching me in spirit?

448
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Because you no longer exist.

449
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We're all willing slaves

450
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
on this farm.

451
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes but not for cat-a-wise.

452
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Not cat-a-wise.

453
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Ever been jealous of an editor?

454
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah, me too.

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I mean...

456
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Is it jealousy?

457
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Is it jealousy

458
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
if I'm taking advantage

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
of the editor's hard work?

460
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Is it jealousy

461
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
if I'm taking advantage?

462
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Strony was here

463
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
peeling you in on the new Zelda game.

464
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I haven't...

465
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm still yet to see it actually.

466
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I do apologize.

467
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
However, it looks fantastic.

468
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I would watch it live with you guys.

469
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But if you didn't know,

470
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
most game trailers

471
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
actually get copyrighted.

472
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Because for promotional reasons

473
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
they get permissions

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
of certain songs

475
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
or additives

476
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes?

477
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It should have been me.

478
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If you phrase it like that,

479
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
yes.

480
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, right.

481
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, fucking relax.

482
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You know.

483
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I just put the files together.

484
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So, can I tell you some secrets?

485
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But these are bad secrets, okay?

486
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
These are bad secrets.

487
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
No one should know.

488
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, Tim...

489
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Tim Schrotto.

490
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Tim Schrotto.

491
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There, see?

492
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Netherlands praten.

493
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm from the Netherlands?

494
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Thank you very much.

495
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
One euro.

496
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Thank you very much.

497
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah.

498
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Streaming must not be named

499
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
was very useful.

500
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I am glad you guys didn't judge me.

501
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I honestly thought I was like,

502
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
relatively like...

503
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But, like, you know,

504
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I went exploring

505
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
and I was like,

506
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
damn,

507
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
strong a freak.

508
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And I'm like,

509
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
am I actually?

510
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Are you guys just scared to explore?

511
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Please leave me alone.

512
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Gami!

513
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Gami, when did you get your hair done?

514
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I've seen more degenerates.

515
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Yeah, we're up there with you.

516
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay, thank God.

517
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Gami, I see you in that tree.

518
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't think I don't see you, Gami.

519
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Gami, don't be naughty.

520
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Gami, that...

521
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Okay, that's just a quick way down.

522
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Tharya, thank you for coming,

523
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
a member.

524
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hi, BW.

525
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I was...

526
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I was like,

527
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
oh, you need to stay filled in.

528
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Right, what's the plan?

529
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What's the plan, Batman?

530
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Up.

531
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What's the plan?

532
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
What's the plan?

533
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You need to tell me the strategies.

534
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Left.

535
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Hmm, I know what left is.

536
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes, yes, left.

537
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Do you remember as a child,

538
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I couldn't do this section?

539
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Same as before.

540
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Left.

541
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Oh, no.

542
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I wonder I couldn't do this as a child.

543
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Same as the beginning.

544
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Up.

545
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Up, left, left, up, right.

546
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Up, left, left, up, right.

547
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Same as two before.

548
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Up, left, left,

549
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
left, up, right.

550
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Up.

551
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, thank god.

552
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Don't ever make me do a logic puzzle again.

553
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The disrespect.

554
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The disrespect.

555
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Make me do a logic puzzle first thing in the morning.

556
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
There was a key that's needed tomorrow.

557
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Okay, a key.

558
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh, it's a new house.

559
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh, hello.

560
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
My name's Dampi.

561
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm a grave digger.

562
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
What's that?

563
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You were called here by the ghost of the king.

564
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That'd be the ancient king of Hyrule who rests here.

565
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I've seen him myself.

566
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Well, it's just king.

567
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I can't see any reason not to let you in here.

568
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Take this key.

569
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Oh, that was a super easy little safe quest.

570
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Mummy do be smart.

571
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Well done.

572
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

573
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Gami!

574
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Gami.

575
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What's with that crow?

576
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
He up and flew away with a key.

577
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Charge after him and get that dang key.

578
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I lost the key.

579
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Have you got a spare?

580
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What?

581
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
A crow took the key and flew away with the tree.

582
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, don't just stand around and get the crow.

583
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Charge at him and give him that tree a rattle if you want it back.

584
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
If you stay with a person long of you,

585
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
spice things up.

586
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh, yeah?

587
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Mellow to spice things up by going in the book.

588
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, it was that quick.

589
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So we managed to get the key back.

590
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah.

591
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Okay.

592
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Please tell me it's not going to swoop down and yank it

593
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and it was just like a little small side thing.

594
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'll open the gate for you.

595
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Be careful this time though.

596
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hello.

597
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm going to kill you.

598
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Hello.

599
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah, let's fuse.

600
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I love crows but that behavior is unexpected.

601
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, we never played that.

602
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What does it do?

603
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
What have we just done?

604
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Hey, I've just had a great idea.

605
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
This will add you a little more risk.

606
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm so excited.

607
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Curious.

608
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
They fit perfectly.

609
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Hi.

610
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
What are you doing here?

611
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
This is a graveyard.

612
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
There's ghosts here.

613
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Oh, yeah.

614
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Speaking of which, my brother lives in town.

615
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
He's a troublemaker prankster,

616
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
but I often wonder what he's doing.

617
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Push.

618
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No.

619
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
No.

620
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Wait.

621
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Why did that give me a noise though?

622
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Did he dig the grave?

623
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Surely not.

624
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay.

625
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, we're not doing that.

626
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
How about this?

627
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
No.

628
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh, okay.

629
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We need to push through graves at a time.

630
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh, we need to hit those buttons.

631
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Wait, are these like all secret graves?

632
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No great braving for our shock and behavior.

633
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Look, I'm a child.

634
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't know the implicate.

635
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Why would I move that one?

636
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And why did it give me the do-do-do-do-do-do-do?

637
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Oh.

638
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Can I do it?

639
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I can.

640
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Can I?

641
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Is that three or four?

642
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I took my legs off.

643
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Oh, let's go.

644
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You got a piece of heart.

645
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Dang straight, I got a piece of heart.

646
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm just so good, baby.

647
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So this one didn't move.

648
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I wonder if the king's grave is up there.

649
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Surely a mystery.

650
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
We'll never know.

651
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Okay, let's try this again.

652
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
No, no.

653
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's just grave discovery.

654
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
How do I get over there without breaking my guys?

655
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh.

656
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I can just like pass through stuff.

657
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Oh.

658
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Oh.

659
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It may be the royal crepe, but graves are creepy.

660
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
No matter where they are, where is the king's supposed to meet?

661
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm good stuff.

662
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm not so sure.

663
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I even want to help anymore.

664
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Can we just go somewhere that's less creepy?

665
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh my God, he took a hammer in.

666
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
He took a hammer in.

667
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm doing aimbot from halfway through.

668
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm literally sniping him from the map.

669
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So that's horrifying.

670
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Oh no.

671
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What one is it?

672
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Is it this one?

673
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Because I can see a platform there.

674
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Right replaying.

675
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Middle left or right?

676
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
We just wanted to hold.

677
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You can burn the mummies with a lamp.

678
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Right, get that lamp right here.

679
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Middle was first.

680
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, it doesn't make a difference.

681
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What's going on here?

682
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
What's going on?

683
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Ah.

684
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Oh wow, that disappeared so quick.

685
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay, okay, okay.

686
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I was getting a bit worried.

687
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I was getting a bit nervous that nothing was going to occur there.

688
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh no.

689
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
This is not good.

690
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Do I have time?

691
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Wah, wah, wah, wah.

692
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, that was freaking lucky.

693
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Because that was not good.

694
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That was not good.

695
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But we did it.

696
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
We did it.

697
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
We did whatever challenge was necessary.

698
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Further into the...

699
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You...

700
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The devs knew exactly what they were doing putting that there.

701
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That is so cheeky, honestly.

702
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, this totally doesn't look like a battle dome.

703
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
How do I put them on fire?

705
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
How do I put them on fire?

706
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Oh.

707
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I need to give it a drive by.

708
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You didn't tell me there were scallies underneath.

709
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Of course the fires start attacking me too.

710
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh wow, we like sped on that.

711
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We didn't even have to go left or right.

712
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, can you speed it up a bit, mate?

713
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah, a bit quicker.

714
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I've not got all day, mate.

715
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Yeah, a bit faster.

716
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
You got a canstone piece.

717
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
These mystic stones are said to bring happiness.

718
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Fascinating.

719
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
An ancient king of Hyrule.

720
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
How strange.

721
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And the source of the flow.

722
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
What's that supposed to mean?

723
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Her fanny, mate, obviously.

724
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Wait, no, you kicked me out.

725
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I didn't finish exploring.

726
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Let me back in.

727
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Wait, did I even have a key?

728
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, they're fake doors.

729
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
No way.

730
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh wait, how did I get back?

731
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Oh, suck, suck, suck, suck.

732
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Mumbo.

733
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I was like, you said it enough.

734
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
A little cheeky suckage there.

735
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I got nervous there, right.

736
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
We'll go thank the graveyard guy for letting me in.

737
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Thank you.

738
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Oh, he's already gone home.

739
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Honestly, I'd be home too.

740
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Hi.

741
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, less, less, less, up, up, up, down.

742
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
What was that last time?

743
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah, let's fuse.

744
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What you got for me.

745
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Stranny, I know you approve of dolls.

746
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What if the doll is taller than the person normally is?

747
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Has it all been done?

748
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Oh.

749
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, I guess we're going back to the graveyard.

750
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
A tall, skeletal doll?

751
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Cheeky skeletal moment?

752
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I don't know.

753
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Oh, hello.

754
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Hello.

755
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Ah, so you moved the graveyard and now you can go outside.

756
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'll get lonely.

757
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Can you come see me sometime?

758
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I have plenty of Kinstones.

759
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, is this like infinite Kinstone person?

760
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Like a Slenderman doll.

761
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't think I could tolerate a Slenderman doll.

762
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh.

763
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, that's the source of the floor if I've ever seen one.

764
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
A waterfall.

765
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Hello.

766
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
How many shells?

767
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I think we might need to gamble.

768
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Oh, we're 700.

769
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Do you have any more to fuse together like you claimed young lady?

770
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Oh, you do.

771
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I wonder if she's just an infinite...

772
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'll come back.

773
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I'll come back.

774
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I need to cut the grass, okay?

775
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The source of the floor is...

776
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Wow.

777
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I fucking got so nervous.

778
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I was ready to pop at two minutes.

779
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I got a little heated during the stream.

780
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I was ready to pop after two minutes.

781
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I was like, bro, I can't.

782
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
And then I got shy,

783
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
so I actually lasted the normal amount of time

784
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
and I was like, yeah, this one's like...

785
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What's in here?

786
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Hello.

787
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Well, we definitely need to gamble now after that.

788
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Yeah, I expected minutes just to be talking.

789
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
No.

790
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Are we really doing gamble?

791
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I don't know.

792
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Gamble time.

793
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Hello.

794
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Traits.

795
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The odds of us getting the same thing is diabolical.

796
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
If we end up with the same one figure percentage,

797
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
this just proves my gamble luck is just outrageously bad.

798
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Aw, Zill and friends.

799
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Zill is the one with the drippy nose.

800
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
He likes to wander around town with his pals.

801
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
He knows a lot about Hyrule and he might even give you some tips.

802
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Aw.

803
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't...

804
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Right, we'll do this for like a whole four minutes, okay?

805
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That's the best I got.

806
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Four minutes in me and then we'll move on to the actual gameplay.

807
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think we have to go top right now

808
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
and then we unlock the last area and the last item.

809
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Um...

810
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Our probability is 97%.

811
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
How many...

812
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Is there a hundred figurines on the door?

813
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You...

814
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Catch a game play.

815
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Golden rule.

816
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
They call the snakes the rules.

817
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I mean, I guess.

818
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Okay.

819
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Stunning hearing you finish...

820
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Oh.

821
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Great.

822
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Now she's cool to live.

823
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Aw, wait a minute.

824
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm glad you...

825
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Bond Liz.

826
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Thank you for the mimbo.

827
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
There's a girl from my hero.

828
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Your profile picture is bigger.

829
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Let's take the girl from my hero.

830
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I just forgot the name.

831
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
95%.

832
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Right.

833
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'll stop.

834
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yeah, tell you what, I'll make a deal.

835
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'll stop once we get a duplicate.

836
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
A chaser.

837
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah, those things were chasing me.

838
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
They were getting my ankles, honestly.

839
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
We'll stop when we get a duplicate so we can be hero.

840
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Hemiko.

841
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah.

842
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There are 136 figurines total.

843
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Okay.

844
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So the probability is two.

845
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Well, I guess that's our gamble time over.

846
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Thank you everyone for playing at home.

847
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I appreciate it.

848
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I appreciate it.

849
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Literally what the percentage is so high.

850
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And it was one that we had literally just go up.

851
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh wait, I can swim now.

852
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Right, can I still not get this?

853
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It doesn't look like...

854
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't see a Minish entrance.

855
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Oh, I need to jump with a freaking cape.

856
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Right, okay, we're gonna go get a cape.

857
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Right, no one wants to trade me.

858
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
That's fine.

859
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
We'll go get some switch for the reeflings

860
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
because I don't want you guys to be too hungry.

861
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
On our adventure, I'll get you your lovely cape.

862
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yes, thank you.

863
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Nothing this time.

864
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That's okay.

865
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
As long as the reefling got some food in this, come on.

866
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I wonder what the mayor says now that we've been in his house.

867
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I may look somewhat idle too, but no, sir.

868
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I'll be working terrifically hard as soon as you leave.

869
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You can bet that.

870
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Oh, he's just like classic doesn't do anything.

871
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Right, we now need to go top.

872
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Right, let's speed things up a bit.

873
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Get to work.

874
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Oh, sorry.

875
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Sorry, my bad.

876
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Wait, is that a bump tree?

877
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, a cheeky bear.

878
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Hey, I could actually use you right now

879
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
because I can't shoot my laser beam.

880
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Thank you.

881
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Basically every polish.

882
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Hey, you can't say that.

883
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Oh, we can swim.

884
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Once we get the last item, we will do a full exploration.

885
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Whoa, I can see that guy with a rock helmet over there.

886
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, I'm getting...

887
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
No, no bomba, no bomba.

888
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Hello.

889
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Oh, that's what the king gave us.

890
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The two fit perfectly.

891
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
He has a cool hat as well.

892
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What's your favorite item in this game?

893
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
A stone door.

894
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So that's what they meant by the source of the flow business.

895
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Well, this waterfall certainly is the source of Hyrule's water.

896
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
According to King Gustav,

897
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
the final element lies somewhere behind these falls.

898
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
We've done a long enough length.

899
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Let's paint that element.

900
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Maybe my favorite item is the light

901
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
so I can fucking see in this cave.

902
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Oh, I'm missing.

903
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm missing.

904
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The bat's just so skinny.

905
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Right, whoops.

906
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
In both.

907
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Um...

908
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh god, what's that doing?

909
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh, you can't destroy it.

910
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm on fire and I can't do anything.

911
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I guess it makes you vulnerable.

912
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, no more bomba.

913
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
No more bombs.

914
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I can't take any more bombs.

915
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Give me my gambaba.

916
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Oh my god, why is he so aggressive?

917
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Get me up this wall.

918
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh no, they're going to chase me up the wall.

919
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
No, leave me alone.

920
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Leave me alone.

921
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I'm just a per innocent boy.

922
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I have no family.

923
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Spare my life.

924
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Hey, we found another wind crest.

925
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Absolutely, right.

926
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Let me think about that.

927
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Stop!

928
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Oh my god, just a minute.

929
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Get me in this cave right now.

930
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It's even worse than the cave.

931
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Oh, that didn't even hurt him.

932
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
What's there here?

933
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Okay, just...

934
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I swear if it shells.

935
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Bro, we've got enough shells.

936
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't want a gambaba though.

937
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I don't want to send gambaba.

938
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Oh, gambaba at the end.

939
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Up or down, up or down.

940
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm going up.

941
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm going up.

942
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm going up stairs.

943
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm going to enter.

944
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Jeez, the bat and fire station caverns.

945
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Think of the tourism industry.

946
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Okay, I'll take you.

947
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
What?

948
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
What?

949
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I need out.

950
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I need out.

951
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Jeez, let me.

952
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The race.

953
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Wait.

954
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I've just done a 360.

955
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
No.

956
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Right.

957
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah, I was going to say,

958
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
there's clearly something in the war

959
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
if it's giving me a ledge.

960
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Some of those are ropes though.

961
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm not even interacting with that.

962
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Anything in here?

963
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Whoa, red.

964
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Oh, yes, I've unlocked it.

965
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Have a gun.

966
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It was like, what?

967
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Oh, I'm rubbish at this game.

968
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Shawnee's going to turn into a hoarder

969
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
of pyramid crafts all of a sudden.

970
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Literally, there's so many shells.

971
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So this wasn't the way I was supposed to go.

972
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
What is?

973
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I think I've done wrong then.

974
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
What?

975
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Oh, there's a door there.

976
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
That I didn't take.

977
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
There is a fitting fitting.

978
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Okay, there we go.

979
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
There we go.

980
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Did it?

981
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Sorry, excuse me.

982
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Pardon me, coming through.

983
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What have we here?

984
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Some kind of vortex?

985
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Well, we seem to have hit a dead end.

986
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
What shall we do from here?

987
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Go in the vortex.

988
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Close talk.

989
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Close talk.

990
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Am I still alive?

991
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Link, what were you thinking, child?

992
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You just reaped the world winds, as they say.

993
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We could be dead right now.

994
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I must admit, it did the trick.

995
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Are we?

996
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Are we?

997
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
In the lands above the clouds?

998
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Then there must be something here

999
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
that can lead us to the fire element.

1000
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Let's go find it.

1001
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Ah, you surprised me.

1002
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Normally, surface dwellers can't walk on the clouds

1003
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
like we do.

1004
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
My sister and I went to the Depokori Festival

1005
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
on Hyrule Town,

1006
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and when we came back,

1007
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
there were monsters everywhere.

1008
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I bet if I could just fuse a Kinstone,

1009
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
but there are monsters about even...

1010
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Do you think you could search for the Kinstone people?

1011
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, do you need like...

1012
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Oh, no, we can do it.

1013
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Fly, Strony, fly!

1014
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
My favorite dungeon.

1015
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Are you late this year?

1016
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I think the air tops are maybe...

1017
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Really?

1018
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I know the reward is like...

1019
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
getting...

1020
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Uh, yeah, we li-

1021
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Did I not skip the clouds?

1022
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Oh, hello.

1023
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Okay, but I don't have what you need.

1024
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
What about you?

1025
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Oh, this is bad, really bad.

1026
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Oh, hey, look at that.

1027
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I've never seen a surface dweller on the clouds.

1028
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
You must be pure of heart.

1029
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Maybe one such as you would listen to the tale of my woe.

1030
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
See?

1031
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Right, I'm...

1032
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I just heard it from your sister.

1033
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Thank you.

1034
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That sounded really rude.

1035
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1036
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I do have it.

1037
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Sorry, I pressed the wrong button.

1038
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
The controls are...

1039
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Slightly different position.

1040
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Ooh, where did we unlock?

1041
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Cause it's red.

1042
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Ooh, is it gonna be a coup?

1043
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, we were just there!

1044
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I was just there!

1045
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Rude.

1046
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Honestly.

1047
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Okay.

1048
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Uh, let's go a little further right?

1049
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Cause I can...

1050
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Or no.

1051
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
What am I the bad dude?

1052
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Heh heh heh.

1053
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
What's down here?

1054
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Wow!

1055
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
We are short.

1056
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I like how we get to dig the clouds.

1057
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
That's so cool.

1058
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh!

1059
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Wait!

1060
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
We can get Kenstone pieces in here?

1061
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Or was that, like, actually there?

1062
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I think that may have actually been sitting there.

1063
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Okay.

1064
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Uh, let's fold down.

1065
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Cause we've not been in them here.

1066
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Wow!

1067
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Hello!

1068
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Did I have your missing piece?

1069
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I did!

1070
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
All yours, buddy.

1071
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Mysterious cloud.

1072
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Uh...

1073
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
A couple more to go, I guess?

1074
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That's probably more shells, honestly.

1075
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Uh, we take a little left here.

1076
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
A little cheeky left.

1077
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Uh, what is over here?

1078
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Is there anything of interest?

1079
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
No.

1080
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Let's jump down first to make sure we have,

1081
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
adequately,

1082
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the woman trouble.

1083
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh god, they're going to knock me off the map.

1084
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Okay.

1085
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Two hit.

1086
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, he just...

1087
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh, we got a...

1088
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1089
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Second piece, second piece.

1090
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yeah, let me get up, let me get up.

1091
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Thank you.

1092
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Skyfish.

1093
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Skyshark.

1094
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Honestly.

1095
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Skiyark.

1096
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Great.

1097
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
What is this down here?

1098
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
A little to the left.

1099
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
A little to the left.

1100
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Let's grab that wind gust.

1101
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Don't want to get in trouble.

1102
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Let me get up.

1103
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Let me get up.

1104
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Uh, oh, there was something up there.

1105
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Hmm.

1106
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Can I do it?

1107
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Whoa, where are you?

1108
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Did I need a shield from him?

1109
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Well, luckily...

1110
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Okay.

1111
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm sorry.

1112
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
What was that supposed to do?

1113
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
A bow and arrow?

1114
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I think a bow and arrow.

1115
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh, suck him up.

1116
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Because he's an arrow thing.

1117
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Gimme your cloud right now.

1118
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1119
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
You're not so big without your cloud now, are you?

1120
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Mario's gonna...

1121
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Oh, sugar.

1122
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Right, we need to come back to this one.

1123
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Because we don't have the correct piece.

1124
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Surely, I will not forget the location.

1125
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Surely.

1126
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Hope you'll...

1127
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Okay, uh, middle left is...

1128
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Uh, tree...

1129
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Middle left.

1130
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
What?

1131
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
What?

1132
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
What?

1133
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
No, chicken shells, but I'm so full.

1134
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Jar of boomerang will not...

1135
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
What?

1136
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That is my favorite mermaid waifu?

1137
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I ain't even a mermaid.

1138
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Oh, good thing.

1139
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Ah.

1140
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, there's another one of those guys.

1141
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Wait, you perish.

1142
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Yeah, we're getting there with the minish.

1143
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We're on the last element,

1144
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and then I think everything goes to do the time.

1145
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

1146
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Perish.

1147
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Oh.

1148
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Okay.

1149
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Is this it?

1150
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay, we now know...

1151
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
it's middle left for whatever one is missing.

1152
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Oh, there's five?

1153
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Oh, them...

1154
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I don't know what one to do then.

1155
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Oh, well, I don't mind if I do.

1156
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh.

1157
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Am I gonna have to do a second lap?

1158
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I feel like I'm gonna have to do a second lap

1159
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
around this area.

1160
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I don't know.

1161
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I can't remember your style.

1162
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
As soon as you said mermaid,

1163
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and I'm like,

1164
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm not a mermaid.

1165
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And I'm like,

1166
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
oh, wait a minute.

1167
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I was like,

1168
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
oh, wait, hold on a minute.

1169
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Hold on a minute.

1170
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I didn't write that part of my line.

1171
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Oh, I got two licks in.

1172
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I'm the most.

1173
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
One each.

1174
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You know, for an enemy,

1175
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
you sure as heck don't actually directly attack.

1176
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I'm gonna get shoved off the map because of that.

1177
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Oh, I need to defeat him.

1178
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
No, I'm...

1179
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Okay, I need like an eight-foot sword,

1180
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
like an Elden Ring.

1181
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Or just do that and knock yourself out.

1182
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Aren't sirens the evil mermaids?

1183
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I mean, I guess.

1184
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I guess you're lucky that I don't have to sing,

1185
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or you'd be in such deep doo-doo.

1186
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
You're not in deep doo-doo.

1187
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Right, enough with the shells.

1188
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We ain't go all the time at Gambo.

1189
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Sure, drop this here.

1190
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I won't say there's something here.

1191
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Just get me up.

1192
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Freaking go.

1193
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
There's a cheeky hole.

1194
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
What's up there?

1195
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't know.

1196
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
What's down here?

1197
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Oh, a fusion.

1198
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I'll take it.

1199
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I'll take it.

1200
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
You fit.

1201
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Perfect.

1202
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I calculated.

1203
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Calculate.

1204
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Yes, yes, calculate.

1205
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
True, true, emoji gamer.

1206
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Okay, two more.

1207
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I have one golden piece.

1208
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I just need the other one.

1209
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I can go back to the middle one that I missed.

1210
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Wow, we can't get up there.

1211
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But we can get radio.

1212
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
There's not like a secret on the wall or anything.

1213
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Where are we going?

1214
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Where are we going?

1215
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Come on.

1216
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Okay, we're now back on the other one.

1217
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I need to go top left to get the last piece.

1218
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Which I'm going to do right now.

1219
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Top left.

1220
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Yes.

1221
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Baby, last piece.

1222
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Oh my God.

1223
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I'm so smart.

1224
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Oh, there's something here.

1225
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Hey, don't give me.

1226
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
You know what?

1227
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Okay.

1228
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Okay.

1229
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I should have gambled.

1230
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I admit it.

1231
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I should have kept gambling.

1232
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I apologize.

1233
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I should have kept gambling.

1234
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Okay.

1235
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I think it was in here.

1236
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Literally the game's like, please gamble.

1237
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I'm like, I'm child.

1238
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I shouldn't be doing it.

1239
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Right.

1240
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Did we?

1241
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I think it's back at the start.

1242
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And the other one.

1243
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
There's a back at the start.

1244
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Question mark.

1245
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I don't know.

1246
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Serves you right for not gambling.

1247
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Did you know that 100% of people that win big give up,

1248
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
like right before,

1249
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I can't remember what the meme format is,

1250
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
but yeah, it's awful.

1251
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Please don't actually gamble.

1252
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I'm actually getting a bit turned around now.

1253
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I'm like 99%.

1254
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I already did this one today.

1255
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So what's up here?

1256
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Okay.

1257
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I grabbed that one.

1258
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
What was back down here?

1259
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I can't remember.

1260
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
90% of gambling addicts quit before they hit big.

1261
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yeah, literally that's so terrible.

1262
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That meme format is absolutely a reader.

1263
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I'd actually be really interested in doing a deep dive

1264
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
into the gamble psychology

1265
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
because I struggle to comprehend it

1266
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
because I just get really...

1267
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Right.

1268
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Am I going the wrong way again?

1269
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I think I might have.

1270
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Oh, I got red.

1271
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Okay, it is just random.

1272
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I'm running in circles.

1273
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I know I'm trying to get back to the start.

1274
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I don't know where the last podium is.

1275
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Any podium goers?

1276
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I think it's back at the start.

1277
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I think I just can go back now because I've got the piece.

1278
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Unless it was back there.

1279
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Wait, hold on.

1280
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Let me do a U-turn.

1281
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm too busy yapping.

1282
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
No, we did do it.

1283
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Right, go back up again.

1284
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah, the last one's back at the start.

1285
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Okay, okay, okay.

1286
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
No, no, Link, no.

1287
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I'm starting to think you just like the gravity of falling.

1288
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You can't go back to the start from here.

1289
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Always gambit till you're broke.

1290
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
No, this is terrible.

1291
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I think it's to the right there.

1292
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Right, I just need to take our U-turn right and then we found it.

1293
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
This, this is it.

1294
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Surely.

1295
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Sure is it.

1296
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh, there it is.

1297
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I just need a drop down.

1298
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Wow.

1299
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Whoever said go right, time them out.

1300
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
No one said that.

1301
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You don't have to say that anymore.

1302
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Oh, we did it, we did it, we did it.

1303
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Get me the heck out here.

1304
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Why gamble when you can give your money a mummy?

1305
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
No, well, you don't need to do that either.

1306
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
What's more of a ways gamble or giving me money?

1307
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Choose your, choose your challenger.

1308
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
We did it, yeah.

1309
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Fantastico, fantastico, let's go.

1310
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And we got two redkenstone pieces of all that.

1311
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Oh my god, look how pretty it is.

1312
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Oh, and we can get a freaking flight stolen.

1313
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Thank goodness.

1314
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Hey, we found another wincrease.

1315
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Now we have one more to travel to when we use the ocarina.

1316
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Hey, ocarina.

1317
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Now, how do you build something like this on top of a clown?

1318
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Maybe someone lives inside.

1319
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
If so, perhaps you could ask for the element.

1320
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I'm just checking if there's a hidden secret on the outside, but no.

1321
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It's kinda...

1322
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Okay, now the man's out of my way.

1323
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Do you remember that portal?

1324
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Do you remember that portal?

1325
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Oh, if it's an old link, my quest to match kinstones has taken me all the way up here.

1326
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I'm not sure you've noticed yet, but we're on top of the clouds.

1327
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
The wind trebles here.

1328
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
They protect the path of the palace of winds where the wind element lies.

1329
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Oh, it's you.

1330
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I thought I'd never make it back here, but thanks to your kinstone, I did.

1331
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
If you're looking for something, go talk to the elderly lady on the fourth floor.

1332
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Okay, elderly lady, fourth floor.

1333
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Blue flower, white thorns.

1334
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
There's something like that, I can't remember.

1335
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Oh yeah, give me your pot.

1336
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Look, there's the old man.

1337
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
He's up in there, and there's something.

1338
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Oh, it's Link.

1339
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Thank you for your help over there.

1340
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I've got something else here.

1341
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Take this.

1342
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Huh?

1343
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Did you double damage?

1344
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Did you double damage?

1345
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Imagine if I let that gentleman slip away.

1346
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Why is everyone asking for the pieces I don't have?

1347
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
You know, feel well.

1348
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I don't have that piece.

1349
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
He just upgraded my bowl.

1350
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Hello?

1351
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Let me guess.

1352
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
You're going to ask for a piece I don't have?

1353
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Oh, you asked for the piece I actually do know.

1354
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Hold the button.

1355
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
A snake.

1356
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

1357
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It's all coming in my way.

1358
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Well done.

1359
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Hey, they set perfectly.

1360
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The wind tribe is very skilled at pieces.

1361
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So skilled in fact.

1362
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
We have more of them than we can manage.

1363
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
We can't even store them.

1364
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I wish someone would take them.

1365
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You wish someone would take them?

1366
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Say no more.

1367
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
No, I'm not doing anything in here at all.

1368
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Yeah, oh, thanks.

1369
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
She's slow.

1370
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I'll take that.

1371
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Don't mind if I do.

1372
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Thanks, hen.

1373
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I appreciate it.

1374
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yeah, your collection's a whale.

1375
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Oh, what's that?

1376
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You need someone to take away all your pieces?

1377
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh, you shouldn't.

1378
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Yeah, you shouldn't.

1379
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
What's going on?

1380
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Welcome, welcome.

1381
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Long, long ago and then the age before that.

1382
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I tried the brand and the place you call the wind ruins.

1383
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
With our magic,

1384
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
we moved our palace up into the skies.

1385
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We are the wind tribe.

1386
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
We've been watching and we know all that is happening

1387
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
on your surface world.

1388
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
We know a small boy collects elements

1389
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
to lift the curse for a princess.

1390
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
We know of Vati and his evil acts.

1391
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
The winds tell us these things.

1392
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
The wind element that you seek lies deep

1393
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
in the palace of winds above me.

1394
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
When the blade has been infused with four elements,

1395
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
sorry, forgetting my lines here,

1396
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
the way to the light force shall open.

1397
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
So it is told in the legend of the wind tribe.

1398
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Vati himself may already know this.

1399
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Surfaced well as they're not permitted

1400
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
to enter our palace,

1401
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
but you, boy, are special.

1402
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
You may continue to the roof.

1403
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Can I fuse with you?

1404
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
You're a cheeky granny, you are.

1405
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
You're cheeky cheeky granny.

1406
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
You got me a weekend stone to fuse.

1407
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
There's this device in the palace

1408
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
that allows you to fly in the sky.

1409
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
When I get bigger,

1410
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I want to explore the palace and find it,

1411
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
but I'm too scared right now.

1412
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You just walked over me.

1413
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
That's rude.

1414
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And before someone complains

1415
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
about being weighed down by Cherries.

1416
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Cherries for me to take.

1417
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Right here.

1418
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh, baby!

1419
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Okay, full health.

1420
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Ready?

1421
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Ready?

1422
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
We're going to do this

1423
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
and I'll make a tea,

1424
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
and then we'll do lots of exploring

1425
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
to see if we can get all the hearts and stuff.

1426
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
One, irritation.

1427
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
We find our way to the very tops of the cloud,

1428
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and then we have to go even higher

1429
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
to find a floating palace.

1430
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I can't believe what a long way we've come.

1431
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And look how high we are.

1432
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Don't look down, blink,

1433
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
and watch your step.

1434
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
It's a long fall from here, ya bam.

1435
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Look, I'm trying my best, jeez.

1436
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Don't need to...

1437
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Oh, I'm gonna need them.

1438
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I'm gonna need to...

1439
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
There's so many enemies on this map.

1440
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Oh.

1441
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Oh, it made them fall.

1442
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Oh, that's not very nice.

1443
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Where'd they go?

1444
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Can I stop coming?

1445
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
No!

1446
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I didn't know you could do that!

1447
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But the scallies...

1448
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I just got pranked.

1449
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And 4k.

1450
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Alright, hold on.

1451
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
We need to do the boomerang.

1452
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
So we need to do the boomerang?

1453
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Is that it?

1454
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Am I going crazy?

1455
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
What do I need?

1456
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
A bow and arrow?

1457
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Am I like, banned arrows now?

1458
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Okay, okay.

1459
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Arrows, arrows.

1460
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
It's fine, it's fine.

1461
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Guys, why are you sweating?

1462
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I was going,

1463
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
hmm, I missed the logic in this puzzle.

1464
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Oh, whoa.

1465
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I almost fell off the map

1466
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
because I wasn't paying attention.

1467
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Eeps.

1468
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Eeps.

1469
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Okay, let's do a bow and arrow.

1470
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I need to go by with 3?

1471
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1472
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Why would you give me stones?

1473
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I can push, I have no idea.

1474
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Wow.

1475
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Music game, good.

1476
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Wow, please don't hurt me.

1477
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Please don't hurt me.

1478
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Whoa.

1479
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Okay, I've actually got a fright there.

1480
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I'm like, I just jumped in my chair.

1481
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Like, I knew it was going to happen,

1482
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
but I still got a fright nonetheless.

1483
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
What is going on?

1484
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Whoa.

1485
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
What am I to go?

1486
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I can't do that.

1487
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Whoa, whoa.

1488
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Where's the fire going?

1489
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Oh my God, I'm so skinny.

1490
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I'm actually so skinny,

1491
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I didn't get hit once, Lamal.

1492
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
There's a fluffy cloudflown here.

1493
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It looks awfully comfortable.

1494
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I too would like to sleep on a cloud.

1495
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Should I?

1496
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I'm going to use the boomerang.

1497
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Oh.

1498
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Because it doesn't cost any ammo.

1499
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
I jumped too.

1500
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Literally, give me a wee fray.

1501
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh, I'm supposed to be here.

1502
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Ew, what happens if I sat on it?

1503
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Oh, I'm actually...

1504
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Logic puzzle or I'm just...

1505
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Am I going the wrong way?

1506
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Okay.

1507
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Use a bomb.

1508
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I'm about to blow this.

1509
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I would not have figured that out.

1510
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I'm going to be honest.

1511
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Oh, yum.

1512
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Ah.

1513
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Shadow Wizard money game.

1514
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
We look at these spills.

1515
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Well, I lost that fight anyway.

1516
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Oh.

1517
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I wondered that.

1518
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
We unlocked the figurines

1519
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
before we actually went against them.

1520
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro.

1521
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
This is the shit.

1522
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
This is the shit.

1523
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Shadow Wizard money game.

1524
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Oh, I'll get wrecked.

1525
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, I'll get wrecked.

1526
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Oh, bless I am. You've got Rockscape. Great. Jump with the greatness of Ease. Hold the button and jump faster.

1527
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Right. Oh my god. Oh, I'm so good. I'm actually so good.

1528
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
This game. Well, we can officially fully explore the map now. We'll do.

1529
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Gamma. I saw that.

1530
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I'm actually so good. You have this figure. You must be a fan of the family.

1531
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Oh my god. I love being able to jump.

1532
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Okay.

1533
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I just can't roll up them.

1534
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I cast and bear her growth.

1535
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I'm still in mulch. I'm still addicted to mulch.

1536
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Whoa. Game shields up.

1537
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I can't.

1538
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:59,000
There's a strong gale blowing here. Try not to get swept away and hold on to your hat. You're my hat.

1539
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Am I supposed to get blown away? I think I'm supposed to jump.

1540
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I am supposed to jump. Whoa.

1541
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I was almost gone there. I'm not going to lie. We almost didn't make that jump there.

1542
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Oh.

1543
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:27,000
What? Okay. We need to do the magic staff thing.

1544
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Okay. Okay. We're getting there. We're getting there.

1545
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Zelda. Let's go. That panel. I think if we stomped on it hard enough, it might flip over.

1546
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah. We're still missing two bottles. No. I ain't doing it.

1547
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
The money's good, but I ain't doing it.

1548
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I ain't missing it.

1549
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I don't actually remember how difficult the boss is up ahead.

1550
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
There is a possibility we have to go...

1551
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
We have to go back. We have to go deeper.

1552
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Because we are missing out on a lot of exploratory goodies.

1553
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Oh my... Bruh, who's...

1554
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
How skinny you can come?

1555
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Ah, can I do it in time? No, by a freaking bore here.

1556
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
No, Gami. Stop it. Gami, that's mean.

1557
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Okay. It looks like I need to jump between two.

1558
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Yes. After this area, we'll do exploring.

1559
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
We'll try and get full hearts. We'll go back to all those master tutor people as well.

1560
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Professional speedrunner confirmed, actually, though.

1561
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Witch dungeon. This is for the fourth element, the wind element. We're in the sky temple.

1562
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I might want to activate my boots first.

1563
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Oh, I don't like this. I don't like this.

1564
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I'm just going to take the HP damage because...

1565
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah, I don't want to have to do this.

1566
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Oh, and the fucking boots respawned.

1567
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Well, I'm not mad with Spain.

1568
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, and the respawn.

1569
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
One thing I could absolutely decimate about this game.

1570
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Okay, and then straight down.

1571
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Jeez, get me over there.

1572
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I tried to put up my uno collab.

1573
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Schedule, and it kept rejecting it for some reason.

1574
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I think me, Mercy, and me are just too powerful.

1575
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I kept saying error when I put it up.

1576
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Sorry about the uno collab not being up, but there is an uno collab.

1577
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh, as far as I'm aware, there's an uno collab.

1578
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Silly me. Silly me. I'm being a silly sausage.

1579
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
But I'll try and get it up.

1580
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Why did you do that?

1581
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I'll try and get it up after the stream.

1582
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Oh, killing me.

1583
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Tiny time. Tiny time.

1584
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Tiny time.

1585
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Oh, no. Oh, no, this can't be.

1586
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Is this a logic puzzle? Well, I can only push it.

1587
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Oh, shit.

1588
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Like this.

1589
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Oh, that's a star.

1590
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
A bluntly half as well.

1591
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I'm making it worse.

1592
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm making it worse.

1593
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I'm making it worse.

1594
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm making it worse.

1595
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh, no way I did it.

1596
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Oh, no way I did it.

1597
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Oh, my God. I don't know how I did that.

1598
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I'll take it.

1599
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I think this dungeon

1600
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
is actually pretty big.

1601
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Can't believe you let me cook.

1602
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Can I jump over this?

1603
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Can I jump over this?

1604
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
No.

1605
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Oh.

1606
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I never see it until it's really obvious.

1607
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I got it lucky.

1608
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Wait, no.

1609
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Did not already have access to this area?

1610
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Did not already have access to this area?

1611
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I'm losing it.

1612
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
But I just did that.

1613
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Oh, I have a key to get here.

1614
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Yeah. When Twilight Princess, I've never played another Zelda game.

1615
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This is the issue. The only reason I'm doing malely good on this one

1616
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
is because I actually played it before.

1617
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But focusing, there's another...

1618
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
a new 2D Zelda out which I'm actually super interested in.

1619
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I need to watch the trailer.

1620
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:15,000
But I think we might be playing Baltoi.

1621
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Baltoi? Baltoi.

1622
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Baltoi next week.

1623
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
That's lovely, the piece that I've been needing.

1624
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I need to do what now?

1625
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Okay, I just send it.

1626
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
What?

1627
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Thank you, Imperial Monarch. You're work right now?

1628
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Oh, I'm doing lawn work. Oh my god.

1629
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Someone commented under the video, like the audio.

1630
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
You should... oh, I'm at work right now.

1631
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
So I can't listen. And I always so tend to send back.

1632
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
No, do it. Get hard at work.

1633
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I can't be doing this. People are getting fucking trouble for this shit, honestly.

1634
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
But I was feeling it yesterday.

1635
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
You guys were letting me talk about whatever my interests are in that.

1636
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So my brain was like, yeah, let's get rid of this.

1637
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
How did I hurt myself in

1638
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
trying to hurt the enemy?

1639
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Please get us in trouble. No, like, literally, I was like, no, this is...

1640
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I had to hold myself back. I don't know if you guys do this,

1641
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
but I type out responses on Twitter and stuff, and then I delete it

1642
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
because I'm like, no, you idiot. That's not a good idea.

1643
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Don't do that. That's so bad of me.

1644
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Hey, it is from...

1645
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Can I even get him? Yeah, I was going to say, can I even get him

1646
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
without perishing? One way or another, he's going to get me.

1647
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
It wouldn't mind some hearts. I'm starting to get a bit low.

1648
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Finally finished working, mummy. Thank you for the... yeah!

1649
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
You're welcome!

1650
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Less than 3,000. Thank you so much.

1651
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Broly legend, thank you. Sorry.

1652
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
I'm struggling. Just, just, just...

1653
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I'm struggling to read. I can't believe it. I can't believe my inability to read

1654
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
is coming back to me. Oh, there's a heart! There's a heart! There's a heart!

1655
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Wait, this is not where I'm supposed to go?

1656
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Where am I supposed to go?

1657
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Oh, I can just go for it.

1658
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Because I have flight now. Can I jump for this one?

1659
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
No, you cannot! Please, if you ever thought that you could

1660
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
perhaps jump for that one, please don't jump for that one.

1661
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Don't be like me and think you can make it. You cannot make that jump.

1662
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Eh...

1663
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
That's what office toilets are for.

1664
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
That's terrible!

1665
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Right into... right in his arms. All of my guests, you're one too.

1666
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Please, game you... this game...

1667
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
What the fuck is that?

1668
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Armor? Okay.

1669
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I need to buy a large quiver right now.

1670
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Because if... ow!

1671
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Bro, this game needs to start dropping hearts. Please do not make me go all the way back to the start. I'll cry.

1672
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Bruh.

1673
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I need focus. I actually need to focus! What's going on?

1674
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I need to focus.

1675
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah, yeah, get fucked.

1676
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
What is going on?

1677
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
How much freaking arrow I put in you?

1678
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Oh, I'm actually gonna die. What happens if you die in Legend of Zelda?

1679
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Oh my god, the teleport's right there, I think.

1680
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
This is the first teleport.

1681
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Okay.

1682
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Let me get up, let me get up.

1683
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Oh! What the...

1684
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Wait, so I put a billion arrows? No, this isn't the teleport out!

1685
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Sugar, I thought this was the teleport here.

1686
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I am so low, but I don't want to go all the way back.

1687
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Holy crap, I just need to not mess it up. Don't mess...

1688
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Don't mess it up, it's fine. Don't mess it up though. Don't mess it up!

1689
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Can someone drop me a heart? Like, seriously?

1690
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
No, I couldn't have done that worse if I tried!

1691
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
If I tried, if I tried. If I tried.

1692
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Literally, the game has put me on life support.

1693
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Oh, am I actually gonna die? I really don't want to go back though!

1694
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh, please have a heart in this.

1695
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Can I keep leaving the room and then coming back?

1696
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Oh wait, I need a pot, sorry.

1697
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Hold on, is this gonna drop a heart if I do this?

1698
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It's dropping rupees, so if it's respawn and there's a chance it'll give me a heart.

1699
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Hold on, hold on!

1700
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Bear with me, bear with me, Aces in the room, bear with me.

1701
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Oh, come on!

1702
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Give us a chance for a heart! Why is this game so

1703
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
allergic to dropping hearts from pots?

1704
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Literally, I'm just getting my bank account up right now.

1705
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
A freaking shell! I don't need a shell!

1706
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
I actually am starting to wonder if they even coded

1707
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
any hearts to drop in these pots.

1708
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Yeah, thanks for the five rupees. That is useless for me right now.

1709
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Do you have fairies? Oh, I do have fairies!

1710
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Alright, I'll use one fairy.

1711
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
That will have to do.

1712
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
There is a possibility.

1713
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
We don't do this, you know that?

1714
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
We might have to go back and get more.

1715
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Thank you for your...

1716
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yeah, you're more than welcome.

1717
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Ah!

1718
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Of course a heart drops when I've dunked the fairy.

1719
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Ah!

1720
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Oh, Justin no more.

1721
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Yeah? Okay, well...

1722
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Shadow Wizard? I'm gonna get it.

1723
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1724
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Don't do that again. Jesus, I was cheating.

1725
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh, they're giving these kinsome pieces though, because I kinda need to trade.

1726
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:23,000
They're gonna lie.

1727
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Don't fight me, bro.

1728
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Give me a heart! Give me a heart! Don't be shy! Give me a heart!

1729
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Can I whack him when I'm around?

1730
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I'm just going for it.

1731
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I'm just going for it. We are getting so low health.

1732
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
We are getting so low health!

1733
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Oh my god. That for a key?

1734
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Something has to give.

1735
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Something has to give.

1736
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Wait, can I just permanently get rid of this guy?

1737
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Fuck you!

1738
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Did they always drop fairies?

1739
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
New Zelda lore?

1740
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Did they always drop fairies when you whack them? Or was that just like really good

1741
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
rear drop?

1742
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Get in my bowl! Get in the jar!

1743
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
What? No!

1744
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
No way!

1745
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Oh my god, we got the big key, but we still don't have the teleport.

1746
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
We didn't drop fairies! Fuckin' get hit ya! Bam!

1747
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Give me that right now. Right, we've got two fairies.

1748
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Oh my god, learning!

1749
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Ronnie talking to Reflings. I just called you guys Ronnie there.

1750
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Ronnie and Reflings together becomes Ronnie!

1751
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and all the hearts are here. Oh god.

1752
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Oh, I'm sure I've mentioned this before, but I'm no good with heights.

1753
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Hold on, I think I see something down there.

1754
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I guess that means we have to take the plunge after all.

1755
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Oh shi...

1756
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1757
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I've got my wee tiny shield. You be nice to...

1758
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I looked the wrong way! No! I'm at full health! Oh my god, sorry.

1759
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I'm having a stroke. Link keeps looking so. I don't know why.

1760
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,000
I don't know why.

1761
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
How big is his freakin' sweat?

1762
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Ah!

1763
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Oh, I need my shield.

1764
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Why is it he can push me off the map?

1765
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
But when I go to push him off the map, that's no possible.

1766
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
And then he says I'm a wane. I've literally...

1767
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Is that gonna work?

1768
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
What am I doing? I'm having a stroke but not the good kind!

1769
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Oh!

1770
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
I'm having a stroke but not the good kind!

1771
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Oh my god!

1772
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Right, I'm just gonna keep coming back and forth.

1773
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
I was getting absolutely rolled. That is embarrassing how bad that went.

1774
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I need to keep coming back to respawn the hearts. I'm so sorry.

1775
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Mapologies, mapologies.

1776
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Yeah, we're definitely

1777
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
exploring to get the rest of the hearts. Because if I'm making and the rest of the

1778
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,000
jars, if I'm making mistakes like that,

1779
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
we ain't gonna be making it through anything. This is supposed to be

1780
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
a game for children question mark? Absolutely not.

1781
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Because that is insane. Right, let's go.

1782
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Is there like 10 Pokemon sound effects

1783
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
in one? What do you mean?

1784
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
How much further do we have to go? This place goes on forever. There's no point in complaining

1785
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
about it. We must press on more. After all, how much more could there be? Come on Link, let's go.

1786
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I like how the game acknowledges this area is so vast and

1787
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
ridiculous. Okay, hearts.

1788
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Oh, no.

1789
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I do not consent.

1790
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Okay, hug someone else.

1791
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Okay, up the stairs.

1792
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
What's up here? Slames.

1793
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Okay, let's suck these guys off.

1794
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Aw, I could have got a double kill there.

1795
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Um...

1796
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Mom.

1797
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Oh, that's what I didn't want.

1798
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I assume I need to do that.

1799
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Well, maybe if you weren't so selfish

1800
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
and now I'm gonna have to restart the room and do that

1801
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
all over again. I should have been new. Oh, I kept them all

1802
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
perished. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.

1803
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Don't be nervous. Don't be shy. Is anyone online

1804
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
right now that I need to shout out from the Allure?

1805
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Any of the Allures online?

1806
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Or what's the situation? Oh, I can jump over these.

1807
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I was like, aw, I can't do anything about that.

1808
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Wee! Oh, just

1809
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:21,000
no more. I got a kill. Sheeby and Azura

1810
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
in 30. Oh my god, that's right. They're playing

1811
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
um, they're playing Jelly Bean game.

1812
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Uh, if anyone wants to join them, you can.

1813
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Oh, sorry, I'm to jump into it. My apologies. Yes, I'm to jump

1814
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,000
into it. Yes, I knew that. Okay, well, I completely missed a lot.

1815
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Wee!

1816
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Uh, yes, they are going to load up a lobby first

1817
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
and give each other, get each other in the lobby

1818
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
and then they're going to reveal the code so you can

1819
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Jelly Bean snipe, uh, Sheeby and Azura.

1820
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Yeah, okay. Jelly Bean game!

1821
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Uh, this is my problem.

1822
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I don't know if they just continually respawn.

1823
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's very plausible that they do.

1824
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Can I not? Okay, I was going to say, can I not do that?

1825
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Uh, no. You're in

1826
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
my way. Please don't do that again.

1827
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Uh,

1828
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I've just done a 360.

1829
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Ow, where?

1830
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Um, I think I need to jump down

1831
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
in the middle here. You know that? You know that? I'm getting a memory.

1832
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I'm getting a memory! Oh, I love Childhood Me.

1833
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
You're so smart. Thank you for coming. We're literally saving this run

1834
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:01,000
right now. Childhood Me, I'm not even joking.

1835
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
We got a...

1836
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Yeah, I'll take that heart, please.

1837
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Great. So we go up here again.

1838
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Core memory found. Literally accessing

1839
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
core memory. Right, and then...

1840
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Oh, you lose health so quick in this game.

1841
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Hold on a minute. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let me try again.

1842
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Let me try again.

1843
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
That's it. Let him get up. Let him get up.

1844
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
If it's gonna be safer going all the way around, I will go all the way around

1845
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:49,000
because, bruh, let him get up.

1846
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Let me redo. Give me a shot. As if this is safer.

1847
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I think I actually is, though.

1848
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Lulululu...

1849
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Lulululu...

1850
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Lulululu...

1851
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Okay.

1852
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Why am I so premature

1853
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
with my fricking actions?

1854
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Man...

1855
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I could have sworn.

1856
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Okay, let's try that again. Let him get...let me get up. Let me go.

1857
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:41,000
There! As everyone is my witness, I am on it.

1858
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Right, so what's up here? Okay, it is definitely

1859
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
a lot faster just to go the other way. I'm not gonna lie.

1860
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Oh, that's a jump down on water.

1861
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
We have an ability to jump down that way if we still desire.

1862
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,000
So then water's over here.

1863
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yeah.

1864
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Shadow Wizard money. Oh, I can't do it.

1865
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
I'm gonna need a cup of tea and I'm gonna...

1866
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I'm gonna need a fricking cup of tea.

1867
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I'm nuking this...I'm nuking this place into oblivion.

1868
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Yeah, that's what you get.

1869
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Do I even have anything that does damage?

1870
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Put me on fire, will you? Yeah, bam!

1871
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Didn't even insult me like that. Right, what we got? What we got? What's the...

1872
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,000
A dungeon map? Well, I didn't even need it.

1873
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Thanks anyway.

1874
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Yeah, you're no grabbing me.

1875
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:09,000
You're no grabbing me. Good luck.

1876
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
No, no! Get me up the stairs.

1877
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs, get up the stairs.

1878
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Oh, why so many?

1879
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
A child's game, by the way.

1880
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Right, fuck it, we're jumping over here.

1881
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I don't know why we're jumping over here, but we're just going for it.

1882
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
We're sending it. Oh, okay, I'll take that.

1883
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
You now have three. Just collect one more and we'll get another unlock.

1884
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
We've got a city to burn. Scottish Rage Charging. No, no, I'm calm.

1885
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I'm calm, I'm calm. Oh, I have to go down.

1886
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Okay, I'll go down.

1887
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,000
See, you're not the only one that can jump your bams, honestly.

1888
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Right, we went left, so now we have to go right.

1889
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:15,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1890
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
I don't even know where we are.

1891
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I don't even know where we are.

1892
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
A freaking rock.

1893
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
At least I got a kingstone piece. Where the heck are we?

1894
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Oh, fuck, fucks sake!

1895
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
We have fucking offerty.

1896
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
What the fuck do I need to go? Right, not that way.

1897
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
We'll go all the way back.

1898
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
As if you guys respawn!

1899
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Yeah, we're definitely

1900
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
exploring. I'm getting like full health.

1901
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
No, no, not the fire though, not the fire though. As long as I don't get the fire,

1902
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
because as soon as you get given the fire, right.

1903
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
You perish. Alright, I know what to do.

1904
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1905
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Come on.

1906
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Get in, get me in.

1907
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh my god, how much health do you have?

1908
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Ay, yay, yay!

1909
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Followed me at the convention like...

1910
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Jeez, I'm getting absolutely wrecked.

1911
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
This is probably the hardest...

1912
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
This has to be the hardest part of the game.

1913
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Bro, this is getting outrageous.

1914
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Oh, please don't run off the map, Link.

1915
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I know your arse is on fire, but please...

1916
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
For me, for me, Link. For me, Linky-Poo.

1917
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Whatever the heck is this wizard?

1918
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
That's the spells.

1919
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Oh my god, right.

1920
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
There's a bomb that has to go here, I'm pretty sure.

1921
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
This is the worst. Literally, I have to admit, like, all of a sudden, this is, like, tedious.

1922
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:41,000
No game developer wants your game to be...

1923
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Huh?

1924
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Am I not?

1925
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Oh, I have to...

1926
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Easy.

1927
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Easy, I'm just...

1928
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Wow, I'm so skinny.

1929
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Actually so skinny, so I had to hold my breath for that when I was like...

1930
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I had to suck in, I had to go...

1931
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Oh, there's the door! We're, like, right at the boss fight!

1932
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I don't think I'm...

1933
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,000
It doesn't matter.

1934
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Okay, we're right at the boss fight.

1935
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
We can do it! We're so close, replay! We're so freaking close!

1936
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Right, so I don't need to do anything here.

1937
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
What do I need to do then?

1938
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Oh!

1939
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,000
See you, jumping on my head.

1940
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hug someone else. Where's my hug?

1941
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Huh?

1942
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I think I got another.

1943
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
What is it?

1944
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I need to go back already.

1945
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Wait, what's going on over here then?

1946
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Hold on, I've missed something. I've missed a...

1947
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I've missed a vital clue. What have I missed?

1948
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
A boomerang? Can boomerang even go over?

1949
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Hello?

1950
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Hit the switch with a bomb.

1951
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
As if that was the move!

1952
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
That wasn't even on the same pixel tail, like...

1953
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That wasn't even on the same tail! How is that supposed to figure that out?

1954
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Oh my god, they're paling me with money as a sorry.

1955
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I need to drop down?

1956
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Am I going crazy?

1957
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I have to go up

1958
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
in order to go down, but only up and a little to the left.

1959
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Okay...

1960
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Up and a little to the left, so there's something to the...that can fall down up here.

1961
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
But I need to fall down on the left side.

1962
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I come friend, I come friend!

1963
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I'm learning, going!

1964
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
I need to fall here.

1965
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Oh!

1966
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I'm so fucking smart! And this game is just proving how smart I am.

1967
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Alright, stop charging bro. I can't hit you if you're charging me.

1968
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I can't hit you if you're charging me and I'm not full health.

1969
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Oh! Bro! You're not even in the same tail as me!

1970
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Glowy.

1971
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I'm going to start dropping bombs.

1972
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
And the Legend of Zelda. The hit video game.

1973
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Legend of Zelda.

1974
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Well, I didn't...

1975
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Can I just shoot?

1976
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Link, sorry.

1977
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Alright, how do I...

1978
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Just jump?

1979
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Oh! How am I supposed to make a mini jump?

1980
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
A mini jump.

1981
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Okay, we did it, we did it.

1982
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Shadow Wizard minigame. We look.

1983
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Oh, I fucked that one up, didn't I?

1984
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Yes, I fucked that one up.

1985
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,000
That was fine, I'll reset when we go up.

1986
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
I think this is the ball?

1987
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I think?

1988
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Please be easier. Oh my god, we're still going?

1989
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Give it a break!

1990
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Alright, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1991
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I've got one fairy to my aid.

1992
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I just need to not mess this up.

1993
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Let's not mess this up. We should watch you play a puzzle game.

1994
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It just ends up with me swearing.

1995
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Okay, okay. I'm already seeing something that I need to.

1996
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Some. Okay.

1997
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1998
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Phase 1 already complete, question mark?

1999
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Phase 1 complete, question mark. Please let me on.

2000
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Do I need to get on? I don't know. Is that supposed to jump on that?

2001
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I don't know. Nope.

2002
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I'm not...

2003
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
What do you want from me?

2004
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
What do you want from me? What do you want from me? Do you want me to get on you? I don't know. Oh, okay.

2005
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
You've just killed me. I just refused to let me on you.

2006
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Maybe I was supposed to jump on you? How is I supposed to know that?

2007
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,000
How is I supposed to know that?

2008
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
It's fine. I didn't need the HP.

2009
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
It's fine. I didn't need the HP.

2010
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
It's fine. I didn't need the HP.

2011
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
So the blue guy is not friendly.

2012
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Go on and fucking spam it!

2013
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I didn't do it. Oh, I didn't do it.

2014
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Hold on. Hold on. I'm fucking dodging me. I'm fucking dodging.

2015
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Wait, hold on. I don't want him to get me.

2016
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Okay, here we go. Now jump on his back.

2017
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Jump on blue. Okay, I'm on blue.

2018
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You like that? You like that? You see that?

2019
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Power and skill. Jump! Okay, it's fine. It's fine. I've got a fairy.

2020
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I've got a fairy. I've got a fairy.

2021
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Why the heck are there so many? I don't even remember.

2022
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
You need to jump. Please jump. Oh my god, please. Please.

2023
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Please. Please! Why is he doing backflips?

2024
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Fuck it!

2025
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
No! The HP can't take anymore!

2026
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I might lose this. I'm not going to lie. I'm actually released.

2027
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I'm not confident. I'm not confident.

2028
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
But that's not going to stop me. That's not going to stop me. Jump on his back.

2029
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Okay, completely miss his back. It's fine. Okay, jump on his back.

2030
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Okay, okay. Easy. Easy. Easy.

2031
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Easy. Easy. Take it. No! Don't jump! Why would it not be

2032
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
sequenced to his freaking back? Why would you do that?

2033
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Why would you do that? Get... Oh, I'm going to need calling a fairy.

2034
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Get on his back right now. Jeez, love.

2035
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Right, bro. If the game doesn't put me on his back, what do you actually want me to do?

2036
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:57,000
What do you want me...

2037
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
We ain't going to do it. I think I'm actually going to die here. Oh my god.

2038
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Stop! He keeps, like, purposely going away.

2039
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Oh, get to fuck. Oh my god, did we do it?

2040
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Oh, thanks again for dropping me. No, it's fine.

2041
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I didn't want to win. It's fine.

2042
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Child's game, by the way. Child's game, by the way!

2043
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And you just nuked my freaking allies.

2044
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Ooh, it actually doesn't really seem

2045
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
to matter what... Oh my god, we did it.

2046
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Don't ever make me do that again. Why was that so hard?

2047
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
My hands were sweating. My hands are literally sweating

2048
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
so much right now. Why was that so hard?

2049
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Oh. Oh, it's a snail.

2050
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
That's wind?

2051
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Is that wind? Why would the wind look like that? Shouldn't it not be, like,

2052
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
a cloud or, like, three little wings? You got the wind element!

2053
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
The wind carries the seeds of flowers scattering life across the lands.

2054
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
That's called wind dispersal on seeds. The wind element is the embodiment

2055
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:13,000
of that power. Yeah, me, though!

2056
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Okay, we now have even more health, which I will take.

2057
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Get me out here. Get me out.

2058
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
At last, we've got all four elements. Let's go

2059
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
revive the sacred blade. Now this is where everything goes to

2060
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Judy Kaka. Bruh, I need a victory

2061
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
cup of tea after that. I'm not even kidding. I need a victory cup of tea.

2062
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Hello, Elder. Now would you like to fuse?

2063
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Poster check.

2064
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Currently a shrimp, the way I like it.

2065
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
A chest in the graveyard?

2066
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Yeah, yeah. I'll take it. I'll take it.

2067
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Oh, they fit perfectly. Right. There's a tornado at the top of the winds.

2068
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Receive the blade. I already did. I thought her dialogue was going to change, actually.

2069
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Okay, I'll get ready. No, no, no.

2070
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Kaka. Oh, we can trade with you as well. You want green.

2071
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:17,000
We destroyed like a billion monsters that need green. Or that drop green, sorry.

2072
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Yes, I am going

2073
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,000
to basically do all the side stuff. Like,

2074
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
no. We'll play gacha. How about that? We'll play gacha

2075
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
for a bit.

2076
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
You guys have so much money. Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

2077
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I'm going to upgrade our quiver size, not to be confused

2078
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
with you quivering last night to

2079
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
my audio. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here all week. That's not even funny.

2080
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Oh. Well, when I said it wasn't funny, you didn't have to actually

2081
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
announce that it wasn't funny. Okay.

2082
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Mate, when I explore before, yes, I absolutely will.

2083
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Where do we start?

2084
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Like, where do we start? Tomato, tomato.

2085
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
There's still a few things you need but to fill store, but no, everything. Yes. Okay, the

2086
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,000
town hasn't gone to Shisa yet. So, I'm actually

2087
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
right. We have the cape.

2088
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
How the fuck do you get in here?

2089
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I don't know how I get that. But yes,

2090
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
there is like, all the

2091
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
weasels floating about on itself. Do everything you've done before you completely

2092
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:41,000
hit the sword because this is the point of no return.

2093
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I already did him and he gave me a heart, I'm pretty sure.

2094
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
The door's shut. We can't open it from the side.

2095
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Why can't he open it from any other side either? Alright, let me upgrade our quiver size.

2096
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Oh, the quiver. Yes, that.

2097
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Kin stone the door, most likely. You are a big

2098
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,000
gender. There's a way you get in that house.

2099
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Right. Oh, are we laundry?

2100
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Hi, Link. If you have an empty ball, I can put one of my charms

2101
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
inside. Oh, that's cute.

2102
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Oh, something red, so it's something good.

2103
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,000
You have to get every figure in

2104
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
the gacha. What does a butterfly do?

2105
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,000
What does a butterfly do?

2106
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
What does a butterfly do?

2107
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I don't know. Oh, she's got to be laundry.

2108
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Oh, wait, you're that ghost. I met your brother.

2109
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Don't worry, I'm already looking for another job.

2110
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Oh.

2111
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I think we can also learn a new technique

2112
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,000
because we've got the cape now. Imagine watching like, I don't know

2113
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
how old Link is lore-wise, but imagine watching like a 12 year old jump

2114
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
of it with a cape. You have the cape. You have acquired a new skill.

2115
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I'm ready to train you. Yes, I would like to train, please. Now I will teach you how to take three.

2116
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
The down thrust. First, equip the cape. Second, equip the sword.

2117
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Jump, and then at your jump's peak, thingy. Yes, I understand.

2118
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
You see it, do you not? What does it do? I must possess you.

2119
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Oh, no.

2120
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Oh, I like that.

2121
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Wait. Hold on a minute.

2122
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Am I not AB?

2123
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Okay, there we go. Sorry, sorry to be a little second there.

2124
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
My apologies, my apologies. Please do not look at me in the eyes. I'm

2125
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
rather embarrassed with that move. Joy butterfly's appear.

2126
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Catch a joy, increase Link's speed while digging, swimming, or shooting. Oh, okay.

2127
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
There's nothing more I can teach you. Now you must train yourself. Okay, we can now go to the other

2128
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
masters to get trained up. Right, we'll do some gachapon,

2129
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,000
since we actually need to do it in order to get full

2130
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,000
health. Are you guys feeling lucky?

2131
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Oh, hello. Yeah, trade. I really

2132
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
wish you could do it all in one go, and before we get like another one that we already have.

2133
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Gambit time.

2134
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Down throws. Big octa rock.

2135
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Octa rock is such a good ASMR trigger word.

2136
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Octa rock, octa rock, octa rock. I'll be saying that in my next

2137
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
ASMR video. Octa rock.

2138
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Gambit time. What are we going to get?

2139
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
What are we going to get? We're going to get Percy.

2140
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Which I didn't actually solve his problem. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have access

2141
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
to his house or something.

2142
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:01,000
If you put extra in it increases your odds of not getting a duplicate. I don't want

2143
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
to burn through it too much. Although

2144
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
we do seem to be getting like tons of stuff anyway.

2145
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Strony calling you a good octa rock ASMR win. Oh no, I never looked.

2146
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Oh, I wasn't paying attention. Sorry, I didn't see what we just unlocked there.

2147
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I like your outfit, Strony. Thanks. I didn't model

2148
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
it myself. I had no say.

2149
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
But I like the bikini.

2150
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
With the tape kind of thing. Okay, we got rope.

2151
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Not to be confused with Chibi.

2152
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
T minus seven minutes until your beloved milfs are live together.

2153
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Playing the most predictable game of all.

2154
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Jelly bean game.

2155
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I'm actually a big fan of color combinations. I'm drawing you right now. Oh yeah?

2156
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
You like my green? My vert? Is this in French or vert?

2157
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,000
It's vert. 91% probability.

2158
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Look, 90% is not really high. Anything above 50% is like a one and two.

2159
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Although then again, you guys did see my luck.

2160
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:13,000
The third time I freaking got it. Yeah, you better buy that

2161
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
freaking figurine. At least you get money if you pull up the same thing again.

2162
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:21,000
And what happened?

2163
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Exactly.

2164
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I can't. Oh!

2165
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:33,000
The great dragonfly.

2166
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Dragonfly Vechiver? I'm actually

2167
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
kind of down. Dragonfly Vechiver.

2168
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
How would she look?

2169
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Would she have a toggle to open up her wings?

2170
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I mean, I like that. Dragonfly Vechiver.

2171
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I don't think I've heard of a dragonfly Vechiver. Oh, the forest bakori.

2172
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Very elegant and ladylike. Would a dragonfly

2173
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
be a milf? Wait a minute!

2174
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
The dragonfly would be a milf because if you didn't know, dragonflies are the most successful

2175
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:13,000
predator.

2176
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Oh my god, I need someone who's in a shot or corner to play her.

2177
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Oh, that would be outrageous.

2178
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Yeah, that's

2179
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
fucked. Yeah, that'd be outrageous. But that's funny as fuck.

2180
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
And before I even put, oh, I'm triggered. Oh, go fuck off me.

2181
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I'm just leaving about. I've actually been getting in a model in Wings and 3D. Dragonfly

2182
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Vechiver. Munker.

2183
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Hire me, I'll do it, I'll do it.

2184
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,000
A to A, geez, the probability going down.

2185
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,000
As long as it's not a blight. A little too far. Oh, all right. Okay, okay.

2186
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
My bad. Speaking of dragonfly.

2187
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
So he gives me five rupees every time I have a duplicate, which I should be the goose.

2188
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Prey and Mantis Vechiver.

2189
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
They don't have, I don't like Prey and Mantis.

2190
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Not far enough.

2191
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Oh, it's Mama's Cafe. This is the best place

2192
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
in Tentorite. She can also pick up some good tips. I actually love this

2193
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
little cute save mission thing. It's actually really sweet. I know it's not

2194
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
like, sweet, sweet, but.

2195
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
87%

2196
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Not far enough.

2197
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
For anyone who is lurking and is like,

2198
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
what on earth are you doing? We have finally unlocked all the items

2199
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
in the Legend of Zelda Minish Cap and we are currently just doing all the side missions

2200
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
because if we progress the story any further, basically

2201
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
everything goes to Judi Kaka and it's not very

2202
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
nice section of the game and the game unfortunately

2203
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
is one of those games that reverts back every time you load up the same save.

2204
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
So the town will not be restored and

2205
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,000
you'll constantly have the ability to do the boss fight type thing.

2206
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And I'd rather have it fun time.

2207
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
The Wind Tribe. God, this is so like 9.

2208
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I wonder how long development took on this game. I feel like a lot of love went into it.

2209
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
You know, a lot of love, a lot of hard work tears.

2210
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I never heard anything bad about the development of Game Boy games, to be honest.

2211
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
But then again, I guess back then you never really ask those kind of questions.

2212
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Like, oh, is, you know,

2213
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
how was development? How is this? How is that? Like it was all insider thingy.

2214
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
But now like development teams in that are being so open and honest

2215
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
and like saying like this is what's happening, this is what we're doing next, the type thing.

2216
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It came, it took Nintendo two years to come up with this beautiful game.

2217
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
That's fantastic. It really is

2218
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:05,000
a beautiful game. Really, really.

2219
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I love it.

2220
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,000
They're paying you rupees for

2221
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,000
JPEGs, honestly. I think this came out. Pina

2222
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Hyrule's Fruit Vendor. She hates vegetables. She won't even sell

2223
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,000
tomatoes even though they technically are fruits. Freak!

2224
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Oh my god, Nintendo!

2225
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Steady on, some folk just dinny like certain palettes. You know, everyone's tongues a wee bit different.

2226
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Oh my god, that is a Nintendo.

2227
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Well, literally, they're

2228
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,000
brutal. They like their fresh veggies.

2229
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Mayor Hagen, the mayor of the town of Hyrule, he's a big collector of odd mass.

2230
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
He's built a shelter in his garden just in case monsters attack Hyrule.

2231
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
He knew. Is he a body?

2232
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
She a fur diver. Every time I hear that I am

2233
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Jingle, I'm the last one trailing off forever.

2234
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Meeps.

2235
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Nintendo went crazy for that one. Hagen Love, you liked that the mayor

2236
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,000
of the town does nothing? Oh, and Eni and Meenie,

2237
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,000
the high-reliant vegetable growing in their fields are exquisitely delicious.

2238
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Apparently, Brocco sells some of their crops.

2239
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,000
They've got like little lore for all the townsfolk. Oh come on, give me a game

2240
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
where it's about restoring a town, please. I'd love it. I'd go absolutely.

2241
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Oh, there's this game that's coming out that's called like...

2242
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,000
It's like a hotel game. You run it.

2243
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Oh, Stockwell and his wee pup. Oh my god, he's called

2244
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Stockwell because he's well-stocked.

2245
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
There's this hotel coming out, but it's like

2246
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
you're playing Vampire or something.

2247
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
And I don't know if it's in Early Access right now

2248
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,000
or they're about to do Early Access.

2249
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Sheebie is live. Is there a...

2250
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Ezlo has Link, a young boy on a quest with Ezlo to restore the four

2251
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
swords with the sword's power he hopes to remove the curse of Princess Zelda.

2252
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Join Sheebie and Ezra live on Fall Games.

2253
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Yes, if you want to play with Sheepsters and Ezra on Fall Guys,

2254
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:29,000
you can do that right now. I kid you not, they are doing it right now.

2255
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
As long as you don't mess up tea.

2256
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Yes, we are literally just playing

2257
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Zelda and finishing the main quest

2258
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:45,000
and all that today. I don't know how long it's going to take. I thought it was only

2259
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,000
going to take four hours, but considering we're at the two hour mark

2260
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,000
and I've made no progress, um, yeah.

2261
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
It's fine. It's fine. This might be a little bit of an

2262
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
endurance stream. Dr. Le, a gruff talking academic type who says

2263
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
he's studying the PCORI. He doesn't seem to be aware that they're actually living in his own house.

2264
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Aw. If you're looking for an older RPG

2265
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
that has rebuilding, look into... look at Dark...

2266
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:17,000
look at Dark Cloud or Dark Chronicle. Oh, I love like the repair

2267
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:21,000
ability in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and Assassin's Creed 2.

2268
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,000
You get to like repair either Monty Regione

2269
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
or Rigatoni, whatever you want to call it.

2270
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Scissorblades, that's actually a pretty good name for them. Or you get to repair like

2271
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Roma and I really like that aspect of like fixing it up and like the environment

2272
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:41,000
changes as you fix stuff up and like you go on quest to do it.

2273
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I would absolutely love to develop some kind of game around that.

2274
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,000
I've not met you yet.

2275
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,000
A great butterfly... oh no, in the Minish Woods.

2276
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I have met you.

2277
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Oh, I didn't realize the fairies were different types.

2278
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Like a dragonfly, a butterfly. So what's the... is it the blue one I've not

2279
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
met yet? No progress blasts through that part of the game.

2280
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I mean, we got the last elemental, that's all we need.

2281
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Past that coded...

2282
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Bro just said Rigatoni. Oh, sugar, that was a joy butterfly.

2283
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I probably could have read that, honestly, but...

2284
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:29,000
We're trying to get through it. What's our percentage now?

2285
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:33,000
75%, ooh. It's getting low.

2286
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
How low can you go? How low can you go?

2287
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Not exactly retro, but Bastion has a little bit of that and it's a good game.

2288
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I haven't played Bastion.

2289
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:49,000
I don't... the only Bastion I've played is...

2290
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Shoulda picked Mercy. Shoulda picked any kind of support.

2291
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
We ended up losing. All your fault, your tears are what I

2292
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
live for.

2293
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Leaver appears in Wild Runes real full. These baddies

2294
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
are really underground. You never know where they might pop up. Keep your shield raised and ready.

2295
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Your race will win, Stan. I wanna be Winston.

2296
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Uh...

2297
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Lucky 2. Lucky 2 appears in the sky.

2298
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
I can't move, but they throw lightning bolts, steal their clothes with the gust star.

2299
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Oh, like how it actually gives you a base on how it flew.

2300
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Oh, Monkers. Monkers, I've got DMs in the discord. What does it mean?

2301
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Um...

2302
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Oh, okay, it's just one of the girls requesting something.

2303
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,000
That's fine.

2304
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
And Shibi might be cooking up something that I wholeheartedly support.

2305
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
So I might need to get her a few assets for that, which is perfectly fine.

2306
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
My apologies, a little bit distracted.

2307
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I can't believe it.

2308
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Shibi, unbelievably, came up with a concept that I

2309
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,000
actually was considering.

2310
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
But it wasn't possible for me to do it

2311
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
because of timing issues, I didn't have enough time to pursue such a project.

2312
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:37,000
However, Shibi just came out with it and I was like...

2313
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:41,000
I've not told her that I actually had an interest in that,

2314
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
but I will 100% support it if she's interested in it. I'm not really sure how to go about it though,

2315
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
because it's a bit hot to track down.

2316
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
But yes, we'll see. We'll see how it goes.

2317
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,000
You just killed him, I did.

2318
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Please read it out loud. No, I can!

2319
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Don't get me wrong, I'm a blabbermouth. I can hardly hide anything that I'm interested in.

2320
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:09,000
But that is not a project that a

2321
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:13,000
beetle appears in various areas.

2322
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:17,000
It is not for me to spill beans about.

2323
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I spill many beans, and I flick many.

2324
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
But that's not for me.

2325
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Probably 50% and then we'll take a break, I'll go get a honey tea because my wee voice box is already...

2326
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Oh, Nairu!

2327
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Nairu, she's looking for a house in Hyrule to move into. She's a descendant from a line of oracles

2328
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,000
of the land of Labriana. I'm going to say that's probably a reference to another

2329
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Zeldor game that I've not played.

2330
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Yes, probability 50% and then we'll have a quick break. Beans and tea

2331
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
all over. Oh, okay.

2332
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Vacuum pumped beans, no thank.

2333
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Do you have anything cooking which not even the girls know about?

2334
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Oh, I've already heard that one. Um, that the girls don't know about?

2335
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
I have monthly events.

2336
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I did post the old monthly events, but some of them are outdated

2337
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
and can no longer be utilized. Oh no, our probability dropped.

2338
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
We'll have to get two in a row that we've had.

2339
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So, in July

2340
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,000
is

2341
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Minecraft server with the girls.

2342
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:41,000
The video game comes out as long as we don't hit any issues.

2343
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Aw, peaceful Hyrule.

2344
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I love that I just got back and you're talking about our flicking beans.

2345
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Oh no, I'm not. Broly legend. I'm talking about beans on toast.

2346
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Cause I'm British.

2347
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Thank you for the tip of the super chat. I'll take it.

2348
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Is the Minecraft server going to have mods or be vanilla?

2349
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
I think Emmy might want it to have mods. I always like vanilla, but

2350
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:13,000
it's up to her.

2351
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I guess it's up to her. Whatever she wants to do.

2352
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Shaders are instance based, so she puts shaders on.

2353
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I don't have to see it. 68% on probability.

2354
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:29,000
We're getting there. We're getting lower.

2355
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:33,000
And after yesterday, I thought Stranny wasn't vanilla. I'm not that bad.

2356
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I didn't think it was that bad.

2357
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
What was that?

2358
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Just...

2359
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
When does the Veil or Game come out and where can I purchase it?

2360
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,000
It is free to play. It will come out on itch.io and you will know about it.

2361
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Ah, sugar! We're really starting to hit the

2362
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,000
repeats.

2363
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Since you said you wanted vanilla Minecraft.

2364
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Azura's Dona Thon is the event

2365
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,000
for August, although I am going to try and ask

2366
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,000
if a VTuber that does game shows will host a

2367
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:21,000
game show for us. I just need to get all the assets together.

2368
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,000
If you didn't know, in order to have a high acceptability

2369
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:29,000
rate on collabs, if you do all the work, people are much more likely

2370
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:33,000
to accept.

2371
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I currently have to do that and put it all together.

2372
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I basically have to reach out and be like, hey, do you want to host all the Veil

2373
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
or girls in a collab? None of us will stream it, so you'll get all the views.

2374
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Oh, by the way, I've actually planned out the entirety of the game show, so all you have

2375
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:53,000
to do is take these assets and files and put them where they belong

2376
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
and then you get to have everything.

2377
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Yeah, basically. So I'm going to try and get that done. I don't know if

2378
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:05,000
they're going to accept the person that I do want to

2379
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:09,000
host it is going to accept.

2380
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Because they are incredibly busy with projects

2381
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:17,000
all the time. But you know what,

2382
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,000
in this world, if you don't ask and be a cheeky shit,

2383
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,000
you don't get... I was talking to Hexa

2384
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:29,000
because she was going to do a watch along, but she felt ill

2385
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
or she had to go to hospital and all of that. And I just checked up on her

2386
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,000
and I was like, I hope you're doing all right now. And I was like, I know this is cheeky

2387
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,000
but do you want to do an ASMR collab? And she was like, fuck you. And I'm like, oh, okay, shit.

2388
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Like, if you don't ask and you don't get in this world, people might be

2389
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:49,000
like, I'm so embarrassed to be rejected by someone for not doing a collab or whatever.

2390
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Bruv. Bruv. Either they'll say yes or no.

2391
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:57,000
And guess what? If they say no, that's not a reflection of your character, that's not a reflection

2392
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
of your work, that's not a reflection of your content. Someone

2393
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,000
might just know before it and that's okay. Like, then you'd be afraid

2394
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
to put yourself out there. Like, literally, I've got what? Six ASMR

2395
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
collabs planned? I mean, I'm about to reach out

2396
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
to more folk. Aww. Cat-less Link.

2397
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I hate that I put Link in all caps now. This is killing me

2398
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
on the inside. ASMR in the hospital

2399
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
but you missed 100%. No, she's not in hospital, then who? Will there

2400
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:33,000
be a link on Discord? Actually, I don't know.

2401
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Discord. I can't...

2402
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:41,000
The main viewer on Twitter can't talk about it but all the girls

2403
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,000
alts can talk about it.

2404
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,000
But yeah, then there's

2405
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:53,000
another seven ASMR

2406
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
collab coming out. Well, there's actually three more in the works. I'm waiting for this

2407
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,000
animator to come back because they're taking their

2408
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,000
sweet arse time and it's kind of just holding up the old

2409
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Oh, Farori. Farori, she's looking for a house. We're sure to got one.

2410
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Looking for a man in finance.

2411
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Eh, right. Want to do... What percentage are we at?

2412
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:21,000
When can I make my cup of tea? 62%.

2413
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Okay, we're getting there. Once we hit 50%, cup of tea time. Do I make

2414
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:29,000
myself clear? You will all get up, you will all stretch your legs, you will all go

2415
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:33,000
and poop poop. Well, I don't know how fast you can go a poop poop.

2416
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,000
We're at 100 rupees because we're absolutely burning through it.

2417
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Sadly, you cannot give all three a house.

2418
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I know! It's absolutely nonsense. And I

2419
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:49,000
realise I actually shouldn't have put that green girl in a house because her reward

2420
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
is she can dye your clothes a certain colour

2421
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,000
but we're already green. So why does she even offer that as a reward?

2422
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Who knows?

2423
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
One of them. We're at 61%. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2424
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I already have popcorn. Do I have to stretch? Yes, everyone has to stretch.

2425
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
What? Goron merchant. Oh no!

2426
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I just realise we haven't helped that poor Goron. Right, we're going to do it.

2427
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
He needs more buddies. We'll get more buddies. I think what we'll do is we'll take

2428
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
everything like one at a time.

2429
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:29,000
60% we're getting down to the 50s.

2430
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
The 90s.

2431
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,000
A mountain pokori! Does it mention their Scottish?

2432
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Their song is actually a saying that they are fully fledged mountain

2433
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:45,000
minish now. Oh. Ting, ting, ting along.

2434
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. What are we at? We're at 59.

2435
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Oh, we're at 59. We're getting there.

2436
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:57,000
You can choose.

2437
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:01,000
You can have, close whatever colour you want as long as it's green basically.

2438
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,000
You have to choose the buff to win. You already helped him twice.

2439
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I know but doesn't he not end up with like six pals or something at one point?

2440
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I basically need to dig in all the mobiles and then trade

2441
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,000
a Kinstone with the walls. I'm like 100% sure that's how

2442
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:21,000
we got his first buddy. I just got you so

2443
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,000
don't do that again. This is why we don't catch her.

2444
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Get your phone, get your phone. How many would you like to see?

2445
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:33,000
How many would you like to see? Wager one.

2446
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Does Scotland have mountains? Yeah, we have Ben Nevis.

2447
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:41,000
It is the highest mountain and a young woman

2448
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:45,000
tends to her cuckoos. If you help her, gather, she'll give you

2449
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
a reward. Yes, she will give money.

2450
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Yes, there is a mountain called Ben Nevis

2451
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:57,000
in Scotland and people climb it. I don't think

2452
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:01,000
it is definitely not severe. Don't you think it's Mount Everest or anything like that?

2453
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:05,000
It's definitely not severe. But Scotland's very hilly.

2454
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Wheaton and pitta. The couple baked bread and high roll.

2455
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Their tasty pastries hold a secret. If you're extra lucky, they'll be a helpful item inside.

2456
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I like that.

2457
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Poor Goron having to rely on wishes to get some

2458
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
pals. Oh no! Oh!

2459
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
The Vealur account finally tweeted out all our mascots and I could see everyone

2460
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,000
together. Did you know Snowberry's mascots are actually the

2461
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:39,000
tallest and biggest out of us all? Out of the

2462
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,000
reflames, the snippets, etc. I think it goes

2463
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:47,000
um

2464
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Who's the smallest? I think Pin Pals. Then

2465
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
the... Oh no!

2466
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Hold on. Herum,

2467
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Pin Pals, reflames, snippets,

2468
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
bleeding hearts, and

2469
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Snowberries in size. So we... Snowberries are the

2470
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:15,000
biggest out of us all. They're big boy.

2471
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,000
No, reflames aren't the smallest. There was a

2472
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
height chart created. I'll need to ask the

2473
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:27,000
freaking concept artist. Um, because

2474
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Emmy, some of you caught it, but

2475
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Emmy's loading screen on her background music was the

2476
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
mascot that was concepted, but she made her

2477
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Pin Pals the way they look now. So I had to get an updated loading screen

2478
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,000
and all that like very quickly. But her background

2479
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,000
music, it was too late. We didn't have time

2480
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
to alter it because we had those assets. There was

2481
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,000
a miscommunication with the asset maker

2482
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Yumi. Yumi's fantastic by the way. I absolutely loved working with her.

2483
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
But there was a miscommunication. I was like, hey, the deadline's

2484
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:11,000
May 1st. And she thought the deadline was June 1st

2485
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
and I'm like, no, that was the debut date and it caused

2486
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:19,000
a bit of a back walk. Um, but we actually had

2487
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,000
that issue. I had that issue with a lot of artists who were making assets.

2488
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Ball and Chain Soldier, whatever you CBT your way off the map because

2489
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:31,000
they didn't want to see you again. I had a lot of issues when

2490
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,000
the debut date was announced

2491
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,000
to be June 1st.

2492
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,000
All artists either saw

2493
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:47,000
that and went, oh, I can take my time with my work.

2494
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
And it was like, no, I'm still asking

2495
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,000
for you to do it by the deadline I gave you, which was more than fair.

2496
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,000
But everyone unanimously. So if you're an artist that worked with us and you're listening

2497
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
right now, don't feel bad because everyone fricking did it.

2498
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:07,000
And everything backlogged to May.

2499
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:11,000
My birthday was actually supposed to be when I was making shorts for everyone

2500
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
and that didn't happen. I was also supposed to pre-make

2501
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,000
all my like, thank you ASMRs, that didn't happen.

2502
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Because everything got clogged into me.

2503
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,000
So it was a fricking developmental nightmare. My mother's birthday.

2504
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Yeah, June 1st.

2505
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:35,000
My birthday now, get wrecked. I don't know.

2506
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,000
You know, in the last dungeon, honestly. Your deadline is like, do not force me to move.

2507
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Yes, I was not budging on debut.

2508
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I'm sorry. I was not delaying any further.

2509
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Man, miss the reflins, okay? I needed to be

2510
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,000
at my reflins the rose.

2511
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Sorry.

2512
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Sorry, I can't, I can't

2513
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:43,000
say what I'm doing right now.

2514
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Wait, back to Gambo.

2515
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
It's spain, everything's spain.

2516
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Everything's spain.

2517
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Everything is spain.

2518
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Everything's cool when you're part of the team.

2519
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
You're almost at 8k, I bloody hope not.

2520
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
I was like, I'll be able to get the clap

2521
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
and ASMR out right now.

2522
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Music

2523
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Music

2524
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Music

2525
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Music

2526

Music

2527
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Music

2528
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Music

2529
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Music

2530
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Music

2531
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Music

2532
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Music

2533
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Music

2534
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Music

2535
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:27,840
Sorry, I'll make a cup of tea in a minute

2536
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:33,960
51% on the thing

2537
02:19:36,560 --> 02:19:38,560
Stony would be the killest boss ever

2538
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:45,000
No, I know how I'm feeling right now. I'd be a terrible boss then

2539
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:47,120
I

2540
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:52,840
Yes

2541
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:54,960
right 51% on the

2542
02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:03,240
percentage over Gacha, please do not gamble. Yes, I am going to try and

2543
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
I

2544
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I

2545
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:14,600
Was extinct steamed from stand

2546
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:20,800
Sorry, sorry

2547
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:25,720
Azura and sheepsters is playing

2548
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:36,160
Fall guys if you want to join them live you most certainly can we are gacha pointing until 50% which we are at so I can go make a honey tea

2549
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:41,860
We have been released from our percentage

2550
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:49,320
Wonder I wonder how low we can actually how low can you wait?

2551
02:21:49,320 --> 02:21:55,520
So does that mean we have 50 gacha now? We're like over halfway there. Oh, yeah, the probability is 49% now

2552
02:21:56,080 --> 02:22:01,600
Wait, so this is terrible to gamble below the rate. This is all gonna be repeats. Is it not now?

2553
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:04,120
Yeah, I was gonna say now that we're below 50%

2554
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:11,960
We have to do well, we're gonna be rich on rupees we have 125 rupees. Sorry my hair's in the way

2555
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:13,960
You can't see it

2556
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:18,760
Great, I pull that lever. Well, if only you could do it automatically. I wish I could feed it in like a

2557
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:21,960
Is it it's called a pachinko machine?

2558
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:25,120
and

2559
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:26,960
I wish I could do it

2560
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:30,360
Still statistically better than one all in

2561
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:33,720
They aren't even plain been

2562
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:37,280
They've been waiting for people for like 20 minutes

2563
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:44,200
As if there's not enough stream snappers to play as if

2564
02:22:44,200 --> 02:23:10,040
Yes, we already had that we've gonna go on a hundred and thirty rupees long

2565
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:16,800
They were late to tell people they could join so now others have to download the game. Oops

2566
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:24,680
Chat to scare to play with the veal or girls. I was gonna say you guys are too scared to go against two mills

2567
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:26,680
What's going on here?

2568
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,720
Hey, you should you quaking in your little boots, huh?

2569
02:23:30,520 --> 02:23:35,320
Hey, little ball sack trembling at the thought of the the superiority that they have over you

2570
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:38,040
Come on now. Don't be scared of them

2571
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:43,240
Yeah, I don't have it installed. Why do you get a lot of replants?

2572
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:49,960
How have you not got that game installed? No fool will appears in dungeons the clinical walls normal tax may not work for the boomerangs

2573
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:54,600
It's pretty effective and they spawn in a fairy. No, I'm literally downloading as we speak, but internet

2574
02:23:55,240 --> 02:24:00,480
Or is the internet absolutely wrecking and decking. It's trembling, but that's no way

2575
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:04,600
How many likes did my cheeky voice click? Yeah, I'm allowed to ask

2576
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:10,120
I was embarrassed by like, oh my god, how many people have interacted with that?

2577
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:18,600
I was actually someone drew me caught up in rope and I was gonna like rate my little cringy paragraph

2578
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:20,600
But I want to do something slightly different

2579
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:28,680
This time around and I might be able to have time to do it after this stream if I don't go too crazy

2580
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,440
I'm still getting home from work

2581
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,440
Oh, yeah

2582
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:35,520
You can't play with the moves

2583
02:24:36,240 --> 02:24:38,560
Wait, does fall guys have cross play with console?

2584
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:41,520
um

2585
02:24:42,400 --> 02:24:44,400
700 lights. Oh my god

2586
02:24:46,240 --> 02:24:48,240
Reflint stop

2587
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:53,760
Yeah, the shabari picture. Yeah, so it's gonna do a cringe thing. That's it

2588
02:24:54,480 --> 02:24:56,480
Wow

2589
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:04,800
Right, we need to actually get all of these in order to get that last heart. So I think we're committing

2590
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,520
We might be committing here and like running our bank dry

2591
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:16,960
Now I know I can increase the odds by increasing the shells, but we're gonna run out of shells long before that

2592
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:20,160
um

2593
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:26,960
Fall guys supports cross play. Okay. Well, there you go. If you've got a console apparently you can do a cheeky stream

2594
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,960
Okay

2595
02:25:57,200 --> 02:25:59,200
Yes, I already have that figurine unfortunately

2596
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:02,080
If I got a figurine

2597
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,160
Would you guys halt glue it for me?

2598
02:26:06,480 --> 02:26:11,040
I don't know why people find it disgusting actually find it pretty good. I really don't mind it

2599
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:17,440
If I had a wee Willy winky, I'd ink all the way your staff, but all you'll spill it

2600
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:20,400
Yes. Yes. Okay. It feels good, man

2601
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:26,720
Oh, sorry. I'm just putting a laser beam off in your freaking shop. Do excuse me

2602
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:32,240
I mean there's already the acrylic

2603
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:35,040
I ordered the kitchen

2604
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:39,840
And I was so excited for them to arrive and then I could show my hands again

2605
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:42,880
Well, just in an ASMR video

2606
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:47,920
Unfortunately my french tip is starting to grow out so it doesn't look very nice

2607
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:51,280
Um, but that's not gonna stop me

2608
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:56,720
Uh, if if it looks I don't know how to take off gel because

2609
02:26:57,280 --> 02:27:03,200
Someone said that if you try to take gel off at home, you create like mustard gas in your own freaking hoost or something like that

2610
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:08,240
Um

2611
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:15,120
Um

2612
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:23,840
Wizard robes get in my face

2613
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Yeah, that stuff does not come off nicely with home put

2614
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:30,480
Yeah, like I don't want to go back to the well, obviously I can't because I'm a freaking tool

2615
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:36,240
but um, I was literally just gonna let it all grow off and like cut my nails as

2616
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:41,040
Like it got like too long. I assume I can cut it without like creating mustard gas

2617
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:44,240
Or is it gonna be too hard to cut?

2618
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:49,120
Actually that reminds me. I need to make uh your tap in ASMR

2619
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:51,760
um

2620
02:27:53,760 --> 02:28:00,640
Because when you have like hard acrylic nails the ASMR comes out so much better. Yeah, it costs fine. Okay, that's fine

2621
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:07,120
Don't make this bleed to our money. Oh, that's mustard gas. Yeah. You have to wait from a growing up. Yeah, that's fine. I don't I don't mind that

2622
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:09,280
Oh

2623
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:16,400
All of these self-transformants have the fighting tournament at the PCORI festival for they are the great potential

2624
02:28:16,640 --> 02:28:18,640
Oh, they see great potential in blink

2625
02:28:19,440 --> 02:28:23,360
Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, so we've not even met all of the masters yet

2626
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:34,080
Okay, how many have we gone through we've not even gone through a hundred pools yet. Jeez

2627
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:36,880
Um

2628
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:39,620
Stroney, I will literally do anything you ask. Oh

2629
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:53,120
Yes, I am waiting for the key chains and then I can do like uh

2630
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:55,680
Maybe just be like a regular ASMR video

2631
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:00,480
But I'll just tap on everything and start like tapping on the girls faces and their wee key chains and that

2632
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:03,680
I think I'm so cute. It's a coin name

2633
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:11,680
And I'll be like this is this is in me and this is a zero and this is a circle and this is sheepsters

2634
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:14,800
um

2635
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:20,480
I've probably said it but I gave the girls nicknames long before they had glee rock

2636
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:27,120
Appears in the cavern of flames a glee rock has a hard rocky shale and mount carino hating and lava

2637
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:31,440
I thoroughly enjoyed him as a boss. I think that was a really good boss

2638
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:37,440
Didn't enjoy the jumpy jumpy boss ear tempo. That was not really for me to be honest

2639
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:42,240
Well, I'm to stop and after 50 percent. I'm addicted

2640
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:46,080
I lose 100 percent of the gacha. I don't pool

2641
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:54,320
See even though we're now at 180 coins. I started at like less than 100 for the duplication

2642
02:29:54,880 --> 02:29:59,040
Same I will do many many things to make Johnny

2643
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:03,920
You you being happy makes me happy. I don't need nothing else

2644
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:06,960
Other than a smile on your goofy face

2645
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:14,160
Maybe maybe if I'm really really well behaved. I might even get a giggle out. Yeah a little hee hee

2646
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,160
Happiness feedback. Oh, yeah

2647
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:26,800
Oh

2648
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:31,600
Minish Vati before he became a sorcerer

2649
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:35,920
He was a simple minish. He had always been entranced by the evil that lives in the hearts of men

2650
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:42,800
There's not evil in the hearts of men must catch a gambler stop before winning big literally be with the next one

2651
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,760
Shawnee does your model have any pierce things?

2652
02:30:46,480 --> 02:30:49,600
My model doesn't have the pierce things. Um

2653
02:30:50,400 --> 02:30:55,280
Originally my bikini toggle was actually gonna have indents to show

2654
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,440
I I'm

2655
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:59,440
to show the pierce things

2656
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:01,520
but um

2657
02:31:01,520 --> 02:31:07,040
It got there was a few there was a few development on the show. So it's like such a small detail that it doesn't matter

2658
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:08,880
Um

2659
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:10,880
Do you have any pierce things? I did

2660
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:13,760
I don't have any facial pierce things

2661
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:16,400
I don't have any ear pierce things

2662
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:19,360
The rest is up to you

2663
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:29,680
Oh god, we're at 41 percent. This is getting bitey. Only the fun one

2664
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:34,320
Um, oh

2665
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:40,400
A mayfly the great mayfly fairy on mount crannel. She provides you a larger bomb bag. Oh wait, so I have seen her

2666
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:47,680
So I've not seen the green fly fairy wherever a dragon fly fairy. Sorry green flies

2667
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:51,520
A belly no

2668
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:55,840
I see was actually supposed to have a belly piercing in her development art

2669
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:59,920
You'll see it. If you didn't see the exposed room. She's doing a short about it

2670
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:02,880
You know for 40 percent

2671
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:07,600
Catch a chance. We're winning pretty big right now. Hold on. We're on a good streak. Let's not forget

2672
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:11,760
I forgot we're going to play this game. I'm like, don't worry. Don't worry

2673
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:17,440
Um, we are at the stage before everything goes to our chaos

2674
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
So an armpit piercing

2675
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:29,920
Um, we are currently just gacha pawning out the wazoo because apparently we need all 100 percent gachas

2676
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:34,960
A in order to get access to a heart that we'll need so we can have full life

2677
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:42,160
Every gacha pill layer with cell is a little cap a strange creature that looks at first like a cap

2678
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:46,400
He speaks roughly and treats link like a child, but he actually really likes link. Oh

2679
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:57,440
Bum piercing got it. Why some surprise? I don't know. I've never heard of an armpit piercing. Oh 37 percent as rough

2680
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:03,600
40 percent is nearly 50 50 totally worth it. Spoken like a true gamble

2681
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:06,560
Spoken like a true gamble

2682
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:14,240
A bunny. No, my bunny is not pierced. I absolutely would not have anything near it

2683
02:33:14,720 --> 02:33:19,680
I do not have a a slight comprehension of the

2684
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:22,320
desirability

2685
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:24,080
to

2686
02:33:24,080 --> 02:33:24,960
Oh

2687
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:26,400
No

2688
02:33:26,400 --> 02:33:31,600
A bunny. Absolutely not. Are you joking? Why are we talking about piercings?

2689
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:36,000
Because I may or may not have some piercings. Do you want to hear it? Oh, hold on

2690
02:33:36,080 --> 02:33:39,280
I think you may be able to hear it if I mute the in-game audio

2691
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,600
Hold on

2692
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:47,920
You may be able to hear this

2693
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:53,200
Do you hear that from a little nail against it?

2694
02:33:57,200 --> 02:33:59,200
There you go that one's for you

2695
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:01,200
Ah

2696
02:34:01,440 --> 02:34:05,520
Tapping it. Oh, should I do tapping ASMR?

2697
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:09,600
Piercing tapping ASMR. Would you guys be done for that?

2698
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:12,960
That would actually be kind of hilarious

2699
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:21,360
Well, let's pray obvious then and you trigger on lot. Oh, yes. Oh my god, right. I'll record that because that's hilarious

2700
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:25,840
Piercing tapping ASMR, wink, wink, nudge, nudge

2701
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:28,320
Yes

2702
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:31,440
Did you just? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I did

2703
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:39,840
Oh, I know our gacha nightmares. We're now at 200 rupees. He we're actually starting to really run into it

2704
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:43,440
Can we tap it for you in the ASMR?

2705
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:46,640
Great. Now pull that lever. I'm pulling it

2706
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:52,320
New unlocked someone is wearing only a hoodie again. No

2707
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:55,840
Maybe

2708
02:34:56,080 --> 02:35:03,760
Yeah, like I had I had a good time yesterday. I do not deserve to wear a bra right now a bra

2709
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:08,720
So

2710
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:13,600
I've been wanting you to make piercing taps. That's funny

2711
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:17,680
Well, you got your wish because I can make it super easily

2712
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,960
I need to make the tummy rumble in ASMR as well ASMR lying on your girlfriend's stomach, but it won't

2713
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:24,960
I

2714
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:30,800
That'll probably be my next like meme ASMR. I'm not really sure it's a thank you ASMR. I think it's a more of a meme ASMR

2715
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:35,600
Only wearing a hoodie nothing else. Yeah, I don't even I don't even have socks on

2716
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:41,520
Heartbeat ASMR when you want to hear my heartbeat

2717
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:42,960
It's not very relaxing

2718
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:46,800
But honestly, do you want me to talk during it or do you just want like breathing?

2719
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:53,920
And heartbeat because of where the mic is placed you can hear like what I breathe and in the other ear quite well when it's against me

2720
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:59,120
It's not going good. It's not going well. We're getting absolutely rigged

2721
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,040
I think I asked for taps on the last day

2722
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:09,120
Socks are the tool of Satan. I honestly don't mind socks because it kind of contains the sweat

2723
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:14,960
Out of curiosity is a picture. I'm going to be audios or will the rest of the stuff

2724
02:36:15,360 --> 02:36:18,960
Or when or will you and the rest of the girls we do and other stuff?

2725
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:22,720
Um, definitely like early access to meme stuff is

2726
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:27,280
Like for me early access or like youtube archive to my audios perfectly fine

2727
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:32,960
Um, as for other stuff. No, it's like audio based content

2728
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:36,480
Talking to please and we talk

2729
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:39,280
Oh, no

2730
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:43,280
Yeah, I'm feeling this percentage probability debuff. This is getting rough

2731
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:48,400
They're one in three now. We're at one in three

2732
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:52,880
With how hot it is over by me me we're in

2733
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:58,320
Even we're in a hoodie. That's worth. Okay. We got it. We got it one in three one in three

2734
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:05,360
Cry at ranting during the heartbeat ranting about what came what see this catcher game and legend is elder

2735
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:12,400
Yeah, freaking probability dropping down to the floor. I bet you probably the probability will be one by the time we're done with it

2736
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:16,560
and

2737
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:18,560
The wind tried

2738
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:21,360
The wind sure

2739
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:24,880
Renting about whatever conspiracies on your mind that day

2740
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:33,920
Oh, I have a really controversial one but might filter people

2741
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:38,320
But then it means more of the tight-knit community. Maybe it's win-win

2742
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:40,480
I

2743
02:37:40,880 --> 02:37:44,240
Strongly be movie script when absolutely not I have no desire for that

2744
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:48,720
I've seen that meme done a few times as well, but if the meme's been done before I might

2745
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:51,600
Whereas like

2746
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:56,320
I I don't want to say anything but I have to admit I've never looked up clapping without

2747
02:37:56,720 --> 02:38:00,640
Clapping ASMR, but without my hands before like I think that's funny as heck, you know

2748
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:04,000
And then again, it's probably already made and it's sitting on youtube

2749
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:08,880
Shawnee always does the filter and yeah, I do it myself. Don't worry. We demand the filter

2750
02:38:09,760 --> 02:38:12,320
Okay, so you know how there's been abortion bans

2751
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:16,960
It's absolutely nothing to do about religion or anything or any of that crap

2752
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:19,920
A mold worm appears in minish roads

2753
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:23,760
They come out of the ground when they sense free if you get swallowed you'll take damage get all dirty

2754
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Watch out because when you're dirty

2755
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:28,480
I've never seen that enemy

2756
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:29,920
and

2757
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:32,000
It's about like it's about

2758
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:36,720
Raising the population because the population is crashing right now

2759
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:42,400
And what happens when a population crashes? Oh, you can't have infinite growth

2760
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:48,240
No infinite growth for you capitalist cogs. No, no, no, no

2761
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:54,880
Um, so that's why bond reception and abortions are being outlawed because we need slaves

2762
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:56,800
We need poor

2763
02:38:56,800 --> 02:39:00,400
Because you know who benefits from abortions and all that stuff

2764
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:07,200
People who are not in a position financially and responsibly to raise children. That's who benefits from that really

2765
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,520
and

2766
02:39:09,520 --> 02:39:11,520
Embryo and all that

2767
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:14,160
So yeah, um

2768
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:16,960
We need more cogs in the capitalist machine

2769
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:18,320
so

2770
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,320
Yeah, again, capital is interesting

2771
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:24,160
because yeah, um because of the nature of

2772
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:30,240
Of um development as well. So if you think two generations back your grandparents will say

2773
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:34,880
I had seven brothers and sisters and then your mum and dad

2774
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:39,520
They had three brothers and sisters and then your mum and dad had

2775
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:43,920
I produced you solo because at the rate of success

2776
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:48,160
You don't need to farm all these children popping out at you willy-nilly

2777
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:52,240
So the population is heading for a crash landing

2778
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,640
fair

2779
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:56,640
Uh ace more running about capitalism

2780
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:03,840
Me mum's the youngest of 11. How many are you gonna have those the question?

2781
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:06,000
because

2782
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:11,440
Statistically it goes big party a big party big family medium family

2783
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Uh, and we're we're heading to one to zero territory. Actually. No, we're already in zero territory

2784
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:24,000
Isn't south korea zero point four for the replacement rate for every two couple

2785
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:29,200
Wait, zero point four. Yeah for every two couples. There's one child

2786
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:32,080
Does that make sense?

2787
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:37,680
One they're gonna be a popper. Yes, exactly. Um

2788
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:42,400
Depends on how many you want. Oh me how many I want

2789
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:44,480
And

2790
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,000
Um

2791
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,280
South korea is at zero point seven. Okay, and I think it went down. Yeah

2792
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:58,880
This is the uncap rhetoric I membership for yeah, I don't even know what uncap is but thank you

2793
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:02,320
Oh any capitalism report. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here

2794
02:41:04,240 --> 02:41:06,240
Um

2795
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:10,080
We'll be having plenty of kids on the farm. No, you're my kid

2796
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:12,720
Is that weird

2797
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:14,720
You're the father. What?

2798
02:41:15,360 --> 02:41:19,120
Oh, I jumped. I was like wait link and jump. Yes link has a cape

2799
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:21,360
um

2800
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:23,360
Do you even want children? Yeah

2801
02:41:24,480 --> 02:41:31,760
With a boisterous crowd and a cute crest these feathered friends are the most popular pets in high rule. The baby chicks are like small boos

2802
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:35,840
Uh, anarchy. Oh an arachnid

2803
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:38,800
Oh, you're teaching me phrases. I don't even

2804
02:41:40,080 --> 02:41:44,080
No, you are my children and I'm also pregnant with you and you're the father

2805
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:50,400
Uh, I'm still not commissioned that artwork. Yeah, I need to hurry up and do it so I can make it because it's hilarious

2806
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:53,920
Ah

2807
02:41:54,720 --> 02:41:57,920
What's your name gammy gammy gammy atlas blossom

2808
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,560
Nice to see you to see you nice

2809
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:03,520
Sweet home

2810
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:05,600
Boy girl both how many

2811
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:08,960
Uh, wherever the reeflings are that's how many

2812
02:42:10,960 --> 02:42:13,120
Whatever number we've got we've gained, you know

2813
02:42:15,360 --> 02:42:17,360
Wow, I've already had that

2814
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:20,320
We're now at 270 coins

2815
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:25,360
8 000 reeflings. That's a lot of birthing. I'm gonna be honest

2816
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:29,920
Birth throws are winning right now. They are absolutely winning

2817
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:33,680
Jen

2818
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:36,640
Uh, I'd rather raise a dog

2819
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:41,440
To be a grandpa of its pup since I love dogs cats. I'm allergic to rip being allergic to cat

2820
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:44,080
I got two precious poodles

2821
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,040
I don't think I'm getting any more putters on

2822
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:52,400
So many questions about that

2823
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:54,400
What about

2824
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:59,920
About me being prego with you, but you're also the dad at the same time. Like don't think about it too much

2825
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:01,920
It's like a little warp

2826
02:43:02,240 --> 02:43:07,360
Um, because like if you Azura's lore is that she's actually your literal mummy

2827
02:43:08,240 --> 02:43:13,920
She creates civilization which makes her your mom technically and all technicality

2828
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:16,720
Uh, but I birthed

2829
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:19,760
Azura technically

2830
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:25,840
Oh, we got a new one our percentage is now less than one in three

2831
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:29,760
It's less than 33 percent. So it's less than one in three

2832
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:32,720
One in three to the infinite

2833
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,720
It makes perfect sense to me. Okay. Well, I'm glad it does because

2834
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:39,840
Prego strongy was off

2835
02:43:41,440 --> 02:43:43,440
Yeah

2836
02:43:43,600 --> 02:43:45,920
Do you want to try some cuttlefish milk?

2837
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:52,000
You just have to do you have to do something first to make the cuttlefish milk come in though

2838
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:54,880
Oh

2839
02:43:55,680 --> 02:44:01,600
Young couple Romeo. Oh raw mayo and julietta grew up next door. They're dating now

2840
02:44:01,600 --> 02:44:05,760
But they plan to marry once they get their pets approval. Then you go talk to their dog

2841
02:44:08,080 --> 02:44:10,080
Yes, god, please

2842
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:14,240
I wish to do that. Maybe I'll get some fun out of that

2843
02:44:15,360 --> 02:44:17,280
um

2844
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:21,040
Like what milton tin I got a beefling diet through

2845
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:27,920
How would that even work? Would you have to get the piercing though? No, um, if you didn't know

2846
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:30,720
boobly mooblies, um

2847
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:34,800
It's not like one singular flow of

2848
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:39,920
Milk, um, it's like little tiny

2849
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:42,880
multiple little things

2850
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:47,200
Um, so the piercings do not have to be removed for that

2851
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:50,640
Just means you have to suck a bit harder

2852
02:44:51,920 --> 02:44:53,920
Oh

2853
02:44:55,120 --> 02:45:04,080
Refreshing treat udders udders. Can he call it udders? That's that's rough calling it udders

2854
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:08,640
We'll have to get a zero to demonstrate

2855
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:12,240
Done for that. We have a deal

2856
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:18,160
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to put the heat in on and get a cup of tea because it's frozen

2857
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:25,760
Nothing nothing. Uh, apparently Aussie houses have like the worst insulation ever

2858
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:27,840
There's like nay insulation to them at all

2859
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:31,680
I believe it because I've rented

2860
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:36,160
And uh, it's absolute piss, so I'm gonna need for the heat on

2861
02:45:37,440 --> 02:45:39,440
Are you saying you want us?

2862
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Exactly

2863
02:45:42,080 --> 02:45:45,600
Oh, oh, they're called chuchu. That's such a good name

2864
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:52,160
Is there like a percentage thing? No, what goes down here?

2865
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:56,640
I don't know what goes down there

2866
02:45:58,640 --> 02:46:04,160
But there isn't a percentage we've got five tiger scrolls. I'm gonna need a few more. I thought I had more than five

2867
02:46:07,520 --> 02:46:11,280
Stony sand in his early. Yeah, I'm gonna need to have you do a certain demonstration

2868
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:19,280
If you didn't know, is there a chibi or live on fall guys right now?

2869
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:22,800
Wow

2870
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:28,880
Oh, I just got weird pain on my leg and my ankle. Please pull the memory amputism. Leave me alone

2871
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:34,720
Oh, we're on 30% now. So if we hit the 20s, that's one in five

2872
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:37,840
One in five gacha pools

2873
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Wow

2874
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:48,240
867 shells, we're gonna be here forever. Should we take a break? Should we take a break and do explore?

2875
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:54,960
Great now pull the lever. Yes. Yes. Okay. We'll take a break. I'll get a tea in me. I will go do some other stuff

2876
02:46:55,360 --> 02:46:57,360
This is there a

2877
02:46:57,440 --> 02:46:59,440

02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:01,440
Oh, I like like

2879
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:06,000
Uh, yes, we'll take a break and we'll go do some questing and we'll come back to this

2880
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:10,880
I am going to 100% this game because I don't think I've ever actually done it before

2881
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:12,400
Um

2882
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:14,240
And I wouldn't mind 100% in it with you

2883
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:19,440
Just gives me another reason to yap your head off for like hours on hours because I thought this is gonna be a forever stream

2884
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:21,520
but certainly in turn another way

2885
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:23,680
Well, she can

2886
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:26,880
I'm just being about domain

2887
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:32,480
Don't overthink it and we could take a drink and get the drink

2888
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:35,520
Okay, I'm gonna go make a honey tea

2889
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:40,560
Uh, when we get the next successful gacha pool and we'll go for a tinkle

2890
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:42,880
Right go away and board head you

2891
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:47,200
I said at the next successful gacha pool

2892
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,360
At the next we will go make a tea

2893
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:06,880
Ah London this small ranch lies just outside high rule town father and daughter teen Talon and

2894
02:48:07,360 --> 02:48:13,440
Malon run it and they sell the finest malon more like melons because I know where that milk really comes from

2895
02:48:15,440 --> 02:48:16,800

The game is nice and gives me kin stones when I need them, but I guess

2899
02:48:30,880 --> 02:48:33,840
Right, I'll leave you guys by the little chicken so you can go

Okay, oh wait, can I sit on these chairs? Can I role-playing sit on the chair? Yeah, okay?

Rolly legend

I really struggled to say your name to two L's on it

2934
02:58:45,920 --> 02:58:49,520
And my brain always recessed on us that I'm saying to me. Hi Gimli. Yeah

2935
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:56,480
I've got you only have one cat. No, I have two putters. I have baby boy and my little princess. Gimli is my princess

2936
02:58:57,120 --> 02:59:01,520
and baby boy is my little munchkin cat that I

2937
02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:05,520
The universe sent to me as a laugh

2938
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:07,920
and

2939
02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:10,160
I am a big

2940
02:59:10,640 --> 02:59:14,160
believer in not breeding cat breeds that are detrimental to their health

2941
02:59:14,720 --> 02:59:19,760
And then the universe said here take this boy and I was like right fine. I will take this boy

2942
02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:23,120
Um, and I love them to pieces

2943
02:59:24,320 --> 02:59:28,080
He's a very silly cat though because he hurt himself and I had to take him to the vet

2944
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:31,040
Which was not a fun experience

2945
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:36,000
Uh, because cats were really dumb and don't show any pain

2946
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:40,000
Uh, and I just it was petting him and his like

2947
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:44,000
Blood had matted his fur on his back leg and I was like, what did you do?

2948
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:48,960
And then I managed to cut it away and he had a big nasty gash on his leg

2949
02:59:49,360 --> 02:59:51,360
but um, he healed up nicely

2950
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:53,760
and and

2951
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:59,360
I was having to warn the vets because I was like, I'm so sorry, but like I've only just got him

2952
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:03,520
I have no idea what his temperament is with vets like if he's aggressive or not

2953
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:09,040
So please be careful and they were like he was the sweetest boy we've had all day and I'm like

2954
03:00:09,280 --> 03:00:13,600
Shucks, you just say that to everyone, don't you? You've got me blushing about my baby boy

2955
03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:16,640
Um, but I'm so sorry

2956
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,640
But I'm gonna be eating with my in my hands. Okay

2957
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,640
I'll try and eat that because I should be lucky

2958
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Oh

2959
03:00:46,640 --> 03:00:49,440
I have to take your time trying to heal it

2960
03:00:50,160 --> 03:00:52,160
Oh

2961
03:00:55,040 --> 03:01:01,120
It's not toast it's chicken lettuce onion on like a flatbread

2962
03:01:06,560 --> 03:01:11,040
Are you gonna be a cat lady? No, I'm gonna be a farm lady wearing milk reeflings all day long

2963
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Mmm

2964
03:01:14,960 --> 03:01:19,920
Oh, I'll tell you something actually about psychology. Do you know

2965
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:28,160
Why is unattractive to women if you don't like animals? I'll see if someone can guess why

2966
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:38,960
Um, but why do you think that women do not like it if men say they do not like animals

2967
03:01:41,360 --> 03:01:45,040
Because then you can't care for them

2968
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:51,440
Shows a lack of empathy. Oh you're getting close indicates. You don't want children. You're getting there

2969
03:01:52,480 --> 03:01:54,000
so

2970
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:57,600
This is absolutely outrageous to say but it is what it is. Um

2971
03:01:58,720 --> 03:02:03,200
Psychology wise animals are viewed as lesser, aren't they?

2972
03:02:04,800 --> 03:02:07,520
Some men view women as lesser

2973
03:02:08,080 --> 03:02:11,840
So if man don't like animal, what does man think about women?

2974
03:02:13,200 --> 03:02:14,720
Hmm

2975
03:02:14,720 --> 03:02:17,760
Scary beans and that is why women naturally do not like men

2976
03:02:18,320 --> 03:02:25,280
Or gravitate to words men that do not like animals if you do not like animals. I'm so sorry, but psychologically it's a big old, uh

2977
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:28,240
Monkey

2978
03:02:28,800 --> 03:02:30,800
Mm-hmm

2979
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:39,600
I love animals, but not women. Why the fuck are you what?

2980
03:02:43,360 --> 03:02:48,000
Do I see or am I just one of the bros be honest or am I like the neighbor next door come on

2981
03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:51,200
Show me the goods show me the goods

2982
03:02:52,160 --> 03:03:00,720
Um, I have some terrible news to break to you about what I've got going on downstairs if you don't like women

2983
03:03:03,120 --> 03:03:06,480
I'm literally I'm literally the guy that doesn't want animals in their house

2984
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:12,640
That's currently petting his dog while getting thinking about getting a second. Yeah

2985
03:03:14,080 --> 03:03:17,920
That's like the most adorable thing my dad was like that with cats is like no

2986
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:21,760
We're not getting another cat and then there would be some sob story

2987
03:03:22,720 --> 03:03:26,880
Our stray would show up. I think we've had three strays show up

2988
03:03:29,040 --> 03:03:31,040
Um and I don't

2989
03:03:32,960 --> 03:03:38,240
You're one of the bros for me. Honestly. All right grip grip session boys. Let's do a soggy biscuit. Well, what about it?

2990
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:44,880
Wait a minute you're a woman

2991
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:50,480
My little baby saved me from being forever little pudders

2992
03:03:52,560 --> 03:03:58,080
Can't have animals. I'm allergic. Oh, that's a shame. There's some hypoallergenic freaks, I think

2993
03:04:02,880 --> 03:04:04,880
But I'm a woman

2994
03:04:05,600 --> 03:04:07,600
Oh

2995
03:04:10,560 --> 03:04:13,040
I love animals, but I'm terrible at taking care of them. Yeah

2996
03:04:14,240 --> 03:04:15,760
I'm I'm

2997
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:18,640
I love my pudders so much. They're they're just perfection

2998
03:04:19,120 --> 03:04:22,240
But you have to treat me like an animal. You need to take me on a walk and stuff

2999
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:25,120
You know

3000
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:32,720
You're opening a pen

3001
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:42,480
Are the animals in a box in a dark room whilst you're pressed against the box by any chance

3002
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:54,480
I thought it was the other way around. Oh, no, no, no, no the leash and the collar goes both ways

3003
03:04:55,120 --> 03:04:58,720
For once it's a not on me, but on you

3004
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:01,520
No

3005
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:11,280
Remove my dinkleberries, I assure you there's no a liquor here anywhere from below my head, I guess

3006
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,160
You need to go nap your tire left

3007
03:05:21,280 --> 03:05:27,600
Strony walks up with the collar and leash time for walkies literally walk me like a dog at the convention

3008
03:05:29,280 --> 03:05:31,280
You

3009
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:39,600
At least connects our collars together. I don't think we're coordinated enough to walk side by side on our hands and knees, are we?

3010
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
You can take me on a walk anytime

3011
03:05:49,680 --> 03:05:51,680
I always say

3012
03:05:52,400 --> 03:05:54,400
I'm

3013
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:59,680
Shorting on the farm with a key leashes out on a walk on

3014
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:23,680
I

3015
03:06:29,600 --> 03:06:33,760
Have almost finished the omelette right there one last day. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to heal

3016
03:06:37,360 --> 03:06:42,560
You talk to the guy behind you when you get all the figures. Oh, that's very lucky

3017
03:06:43,360 --> 03:06:45,360
I'll take that

3018
03:06:51,040 --> 03:06:56,240
Elton ring Joe between straw and reef and spender who walks who wait

3019
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:59,840
But either way isn't a punishment

3020
03:07:00,800 --> 03:07:02,640
We're losing

3021
03:07:02,640 --> 03:07:06,960
Either way, I win you don't understand I win you lose

3022
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:11,680
Someone said that there was like wins pvp

3023
03:07:12,560 --> 03:07:15,280
love sense and I was I was this is like the

3024
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:22,080
Ones that I'll always end up deleting someone was like when is pvp love sense and I was like beat me on

3025
03:07:22,560 --> 03:07:27,600
Black ops one then scrub and then I'd leave it because I thought like a tape set and all that but just

3026
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:32,720
That's the secret straw and he always wins literally

3027
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:35,680
Oh

3028
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:39,200
Everything always comes up strong especially the reeflings

3029
03:07:40,960 --> 03:07:44,640
Have you ever seen the dog that walks other dogs? That sounds we walk each other

3030
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:51,600
We do a bit of that switch up energy. Yeah, I don't

3031
03:07:53,360 --> 03:07:59,840
I think like overall my results were like I like doing a lot to you don't wise but

3032
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:05,280
You call me good girl. I'm gonna melt

3033
03:08:06,480 --> 03:08:08,480
You say good pupper. I'm gonna melt

3034
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:17,680
I would lose intentionally so I could be walked speak for yourself blank never loses

3035
03:08:18,880 --> 03:08:20,880
So is every fling dub

3036
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:25,520
I've never seen a cut off fish on a leash before

3037
03:08:26,400 --> 03:08:30,960
I should do like an actual ed and be like, oh, yeah, you like that. I'm not a cut off fish on leash action

3038
03:08:32,960 --> 03:08:34,960

After all of that

3103
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:36,320
There was money

3104
03:13:36,320 --> 03:13:38,800
Oh, I'll take that though. I'm a bit low

3105
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:42,080
Uh, did we buy the big quiver?

3106
03:13:45,200 --> 03:13:51,680
We did I'm going to dig on the walls though because we had that thing we have to trade that's on a wall

3107
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:55,760
But oh, I don't even know where the heck we are

3108
03:13:57,200 --> 03:14:03,280
But there should be something to trade on a wall, but is it gonna be here? I don't think so

3109
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:05,600
I think it's gonna be around the map

3110
03:14:09,920 --> 03:14:13,760
Okay, that was actually really lucky that I knew oh he jumping me

3111
03:14:16,160 --> 03:14:18,160
Okay, there's nothing to trade here

3112
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:22,000

Okay, let me finish my tea. Did you guys get some food and all of that make sure you hydrate in school under construction?

3117

Right, there's a minish spot in the bakery. We haven't been

3118
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:54,640
There's a pathway to get up here and in there. So is there a teleportation?

3119
03:14:56,160 --> 03:14:58,160
Right

3120
03:14:59,600 --> 03:15:01,600
They don't want to trade

3121
03:15:05,200 --> 03:15:07,920
How do I become small in this area?

3122
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:11,200
Can't do it that way

3123
03:15:11,360 --> 03:15:13,360
It's not possible

3124
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:16,160
That can take me into the bakery if I'm small

3125
03:15:18,480 --> 03:15:21,520
How do you how do you get outside and small oh here here here here?

3126
03:15:22,800 --> 03:15:26,160
Oh, hi. Oh my god. Do you have a wane? When did you have a wane?

3127

Hi popper

3132
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:45,760
You ought to be careful when you're running around. Not all of us are so nice. Well, you're in my way. So

3133
03:15:46,880 --> 03:15:48,000
Right

3134
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:51,440
So now we need to be tiny and go all the way this way

3135
03:15:52,240 --> 03:15:54,320
Oh, wait, is this all gonna be nice? Hi popper

3136
03:15:56,080 --> 03:15:58,080
Your people means trash. Hello

3137
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:00,480
Nope

3138
03:16:00,480 --> 03:16:05,600
Maybe I should go hide in the cocoon league. It may be dangerous. So it seems like there's danger everywhere. Oh

3139
03:16:06,240 --> 03:16:07,840
for guys

3140
03:16:07,840 --> 03:16:10,160
Suppose there was a car oracle game before

3141
03:16:11,200 --> 03:16:14,640
Wait, let's go to the bakery first. She does show up at both the oracle

3142
03:16:15,600 --> 03:16:17,600
games

3143
03:16:18,480 --> 03:16:20,480
Am I gonna get hurt?

3144
03:16:20,720 --> 03:16:22,720
I am gonna get hurt during it

3145
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:25,120
Hi

Oh, you having a little cat? I like eating leftovers. I just wish the business was going better for him

3147
03:16:31,440 --> 03:16:33,440
Why is it not going better?

3148
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:38,240
Do you need me to clean up? I will clean up right now. Don't think I won't

3149
03:16:39,280 --> 03:16:44,240
Have his business not going good for them. Sorry if they're charging 60 rupees for a slice of cake sauce

3150
03:16:44,320 --> 03:16:46,320
But your business should be doing fine

3151
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:52,560
Uh, I'm not buying it. I'm not buying it. Let's go on here

3152
03:16:53,280 --> 03:16:55,760
Sorry guys. Don't need to suck your

3153
03:16:56,560 --> 03:16:58,560
Keep that on

3154
03:16:58,640 --> 03:17:01,680
Sorry a few and fewer people are coming to buy bread

3155
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:07,360
I can't believe how dangerous it's gotten around here. Uh, I wonder if it's because all the monsters are back

3156
03:17:08,800 --> 03:17:10,800
Oh, there's just money up here

3157
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:16,000
We don't need no money. Well, we may if we're buying shells actually

3158
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:26,560
All right, I'm gonna try and finish my now I might as well just send it then. Um, I'll try and finish my tea my cup of tea

3159
03:17:34,400 --> 03:17:36,400
These little flower paths are actually

3160
03:17:37,520 --> 03:17:40,560
It's exactly what I wanted to see. This is the stuff we need

3161
03:17:41,680 --> 03:17:45,520
Give it to me. Oh my god. We complete another heart

3162
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:49,120
How many one two three four five six seven

3163
03:17:49,760 --> 03:17:52,400
If seven are missing what seven times four

3164
03:17:53,360 --> 03:17:55,760
Uh, wait, let me calculate it

3165
03:17:56,560 --> 03:17:58,560
seven times

3166
03:17:58,720 --> 03:18:00,720
four

3167
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:05,760
Four seven seven fourteen twenty one twenty eight boom. That's right

3168
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:09,120
I did maths. What are you gonna do about it?

3169
03:18:10,080 --> 03:18:16,160
Take me to me a hot second to come out with that there, but we got there in the end. That's the most important part

3170
03:18:17,360 --> 03:18:18,800
Uh

3171
03:18:18,800 --> 03:18:23,680
Right, I don't think there's anything we can do right now that ghost is unfortunately still in the way

3172
03:18:24,240 --> 03:18:25,760
galaxy bean streamer

3173
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:26,800
Oh had to do that

3174
03:18:26,800 --> 03:18:31,920
I was like I was gonna do like four times five, but I'm like wait, that's not gonna get me to the number that I need

3175
03:18:32,160 --> 03:18:34,160
I need more of those numbers

3176
03:18:34,960 --> 03:18:38,320
She doesn't want to trade you don't want to do a freaking thing

3177
03:18:39,760 --> 03:18:41,520
um

3178
03:18:41,520 --> 03:18:44,080
I don't I've already done his quest

3179
03:18:45,200 --> 03:18:48,080
Yeah, I can buy shells if I really need

3180
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:51,120
Wait, you can demand

3181
03:18:51,760 --> 03:18:53,920
sometimes

3182
03:18:53,920 --> 03:18:56,320
And I don't think anyone wants to trade

3183
03:18:57,760 --> 03:19:01,360
Kinstones not we're out of kinstone traders

3184
03:19:04,560 --> 03:19:06,560
Right, I think

3185
03:19:06,640 --> 03:19:12,880
We've done what we can for the towns people on the most part anyway. Oh, no

3186
03:19:15,520 --> 03:19:18,560
Yeah, I grab this how much is this 50

3187
03:19:21,920 --> 03:19:26,560
And then we need to feed the reeflings to make sure they're okay, I will get a croissant this time

3188
03:19:29,200 --> 03:19:31,200
Yeah, I'll buy

3189
03:19:32,160 --> 03:19:36,720
Wait if I buy everything do the minish change

3190
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:41,760
Maybe the minish are like yay. We're sold out if I buy everything

3191
03:19:42,640 --> 03:19:44,640
Hold on

3192
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:48,800
Welcome tasty tasty. Yes, bye, please

3193
03:19:50,720 --> 03:19:53,520
Yay, we've got a blue one. Let's go give me give me

3194
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:55,760
Oh

3195
03:19:55,760 --> 03:20:00,080
The question but if you got a color for his reef and what color I think it would

3196
03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:03,120
Oh green might be a bit ugly though

3197
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:10,080
Welcome, please buy whatever you like I have terrible news. You ain't got nothing to buy

3198
03:20:10,320 --> 03:20:15,120
Hmm, right. Well, that was a waste of money. Let me guess it's gonna restart as soon as we go back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

3199
03:20:16,480 --> 03:20:21,040
Um, I want to say green, but I don't think it would look that nice. I think black just black looks good

3200
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:30,480
Purple like my eyeball my eyes are blue and my eyes are blue and yellow. Have I really not shown you my eyes enough?

3201
03:20:33,040 --> 03:20:37,360
Like they're blue. Oh, are they purple? Hold on. They look blue to me

3202
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:43,360
I'm not colorblind. What color are my eyes? Tell me right now

3203
03:20:45,120 --> 03:20:47,120
Blueish purple

3204
03:20:47,920 --> 03:20:52,560
Okay, now tell me what color my eyes are

3205
03:20:55,680 --> 03:20:57,680
Too late now

3206
03:20:57,840 --> 03:21:03,040
Oh, that's those. Oh, that that looks more purple. Well, okay, that definitely looks more purple

3207
03:21:05,120 --> 03:21:09,760
Yeah, oh no, I think you guys are right the black rock headquarters

3208
03:21:10,560 --> 03:21:14,800
Stop that's my problem. My favorite. Oh, where did the heck did I go? Hold on. Sorry

3209
03:21:15,520 --> 03:21:19,360
I'm too much. Sorry. I'm being an unprofessional streamer at the moment

3210
03:21:22,880 --> 03:21:29,440
Black rock headquarters. So I can't get over how fucking hilarious that meme is. Do any of you guys want to trade Ken Stone?

3211
03:21:30,960 --> 03:21:34,480
Welcome to the library. Right. Let me finish this here. Keep saying I'm gonna finish it. I don't

3212
03:21:45,280 --> 03:21:47,280
Uh

3213
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:53,440
Okay, whatever. Um, oh, maybe this guy will

3214
03:21:56,880 --> 03:22:00,160
Oh, yeah the exchange Ken Stone pieces with me

3215
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:08,720
Have you ever watched like a medican popcorn? It's always that like

3216
03:22:15,520 --> 03:22:17,520
Oh

3217
03:22:19,200 --> 03:22:25,280
My god, you're so right the bell in the middle. You're so freaking right. Wow

3218
03:22:27,360 --> 03:22:29,840
Yes, I completely forgot

3219
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:33,600
Okay

3220
03:22:33,600 --> 03:22:39,440
Now I think I've done everything if no one is trading me pieces. I want to but basically backtrack

3221
03:22:40,400 --> 03:22:43,840
Oh, no, we need to do we need if we need to um

3222
03:22:45,280 --> 03:22:49,760
Yes, hold on. Hold on. I think we need to trade that little minish guy

3223
03:22:51,280 --> 03:22:52,640
Um

3224
03:22:52,640 --> 03:22:54,080
and then

3225
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:56,080
His wish will be er

3226
03:22:57,440 --> 03:22:59,280
He'll make a

3227
03:22:59,280 --> 03:23:04,160
I am so sorry. I'm trying to speak one sentence right now. I think this becomes a house

3228
03:23:04,720 --> 03:23:06,560
Oh, no, it doesn't

3229
03:23:06,560 --> 03:23:08,560
But it's not him that makes the house

3230
03:23:09,360 --> 03:23:11,360
Happy to help good girl. Hey

3231
03:23:14,880 --> 03:23:17,840
I've been submissive enough for one day

3232
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:21,600
Right, so that was all about reading

3233
03:23:22,880 --> 03:23:24,880
So then what was this?

3234
03:23:25,840 --> 03:23:30,000
You know can it must be the one that's in the builders heart

3235
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:38,080
I'm not watching professional corn

3236
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:42,160
I just find it funny because if you ever watch like American

3237
03:23:43,120 --> 03:23:45,680
Like mainstream all you'll hear is

3238
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:50,880
Okay

3239
03:23:51,440 --> 03:23:53,440
I don't know how to get that house down

3240
03:23:57,440 --> 03:23:59,440
No one wants to use with me

3241
03:24:00,160 --> 03:24:03,520
What's that? I should stay indoors just because there's monsters about don't be silly

3242
03:24:05,520 --> 03:24:07,520
I literally if you ever

3243
03:24:07,520 --> 03:24:09,520
Yeah

3244
03:24:09,520 --> 03:24:15,520
Without fail right. He doesn't do it can still infusion which is fun. I'm finally home from work time to eat rest well

3245
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:18,160
Sleepy

3246
03:24:18,160 --> 03:24:22,160
Maybe I'll build here. I think yeah, but how do I get you to build there? How?

3247
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:25,040
I don't know

3248
03:24:25,200 --> 03:24:29,040
Okay, everyone's dialogue has now changed to be worried about the monsters

3249
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:31,760
That's curious

3250
03:24:31,760 --> 03:24:33,840
Oh him him him you're new

3251
03:24:34,320 --> 03:24:38,560
Yes, it must be you it must be you because you're new you're not normal here

3252
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:45,920
It doesn't destroy the minish house that we I rehomes the minish in the house

3253
03:24:50,320 --> 03:24:56,640
And I'm secretly 87 years old oji san spotted and I lay oji san on site. Yeah, we did it

3254
03:24:57,600 --> 03:25:01,120
Okay, now if we go in and out it should be built

3255
03:25:01,840 --> 03:25:07,040
No, not yet. I'll build here. I think wait. How does that progress?

3256
03:25:09,200 --> 03:25:11,200
Oh, wow it progressed. Okay

3257
03:25:12,240 --> 03:25:16,560
Tell you I just need a single female. I bet you need a single female

3258
03:25:18,880 --> 03:25:24,240
I guess rent free as long as she's pretty. Okay, I should I should that red up poster. Oh god

3259
03:25:25,520 --> 03:25:28,000
Right, uh red or blue

3260
03:25:28,560 --> 03:25:35,440
Oh, you're showing me an empty house. Well, not yet. Hold on. Why not? Hey, why not? Well, let me know if something comes up

3261
03:25:38,080 --> 03:25:42,400
You want red buff or blue buff. What does red or blue do a single one?

3262
03:25:47,200 --> 03:25:53,200
Red gives damage blue gives defense I may actually need blue on ironically

3263
03:25:53,760 --> 03:25:55,760
I

3264
03:25:57,280 --> 03:26:00,560
I am more of a defense than uh, what does green do then?

3265
03:26:02,800 --> 03:26:04,800
I am a defense boy

3266
03:26:06,960 --> 03:26:11,520
Actually, what happens in here? Do we even gamble? What what was this? Oh, no customer

3267
03:26:12,800 --> 03:26:18,000
Welcome. What do you give me? Yeah, sure 10 rupees. Take it. What would I do?

3268
03:26:18,720 --> 03:26:25,440
What would I do? Level one is more than enough to take your money, but if you're feeling particularly we've already gone level two

3269
03:26:26,320 --> 03:26:29,120
Uh level two. Why not?

3270
03:26:30,400 --> 03:26:32,400
I have no idea what we're doing

3271
03:26:32,800 --> 03:26:34,800
What?

3272
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:39,600
Just open which chest you like if you win. Oh right

3273
03:26:40,800 --> 03:26:44,720
What one left middle right and whoever gets it wrong is getting timed out

3274
03:26:45,600 --> 03:26:48,640
I'll open up my stream right now second time is all out if you get it wrong

3275
03:26:49,680 --> 03:26:54,080
Right, someone says right. Okay, we'll pick right. Are you getting timed out if it's wrong zone?

3276
03:26:55,840 --> 03:26:57,840
Right is

3277
03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:00,080
No way you got that right

3278
03:27:01,680 --> 03:27:03,680
How did you do that?

3279
03:27:06,080 --> 03:27:12,800
Do you want to wager again? Sure. Why not? I see where you're ready open another check, right? Okay new one

3281
03:27:24,320 --> 03:27:30,640
What are you saying double or none gamble middle first one was middle. Oh right time out whoever says middle time out

3282
03:27:31,680 --> 03:27:37,680

Middle not you Timo Timo. No, you're wrong

3285
03:27:49,440 --> 03:27:51,440
All the chat's getting removed

03:27:54,160 --> 03:27:57,040
Yeah, okay, we we're done

3287
03:27:58,240 --> 03:28:01,680
Last time I listened to you guys again. I'll the chat again remove. Yeah

03:28:02,800 --> 03:28:06,240
Don't ever do that again. Sorry. No crazy stainless right gambling is not what it is

3289
03:28:06,640 --> 03:28:10,960
And don't think maybe I'll win next time either. Wait, they're actually saying it wake up man

3290
03:28:10,960 --> 03:28:12,960
Get out here before you lose the shirt off your back

3291
03:28:16,480 --> 03:28:18,480
All done all done

3292
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:28,240
Is there anything else in town no right, I think we're going to take it from the top

3293
03:28:28,240 --> 03:28:31,200
We'll start at link's house and work her way to

3294
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:33,920
Oh

3295
03:28:34,800 --> 03:28:36,800
I'm not even going to start it

3296
03:28:37,760 --> 03:28:40,560
Uh, there may be kinstone pieces if we cut the grass

3297
03:28:41,120 --> 03:28:43,120
No, I told the lie clearly

3298
03:28:44,080 --> 03:28:46,080
There's a beetle coming after my ankles

3299
03:28:49,840 --> 03:28:54,640
All right, we can swim as well just as a reminder we can swim now

3300
03:28:55,600 --> 03:28:59,440
But yeah, we're going going a little adventure now

3301
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:04,000
Oh

3302
03:29:06,560 --> 03:29:08,560
Red which means major

3303
03:29:09,120 --> 03:29:11,120
Which means major

3304
03:29:11,680 --> 03:29:15,200
Pause my get my screen off the my stream off the screen

Oh, what did we unlock syrup syrup got an idea for a new potion

3306
03:29:24,480 --> 03:29:32,960
Hmm my special red potion is that damage is this just damage and defense at syrups

3307
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:38,080
We did it right. Let me just make sure that's everything for you buddy

3308
03:29:38,240 --> 03:29:42,640
It is so I hear the mushroom lady finish a new potion. It's bright red. That is one seriously nasty color

3309
03:29:42,720 --> 03:29:48,240
I'm not touching it. Okay. We've unlocked a aggro via syrup

3310
03:29:48,960 --> 03:29:55,360
I did it. What's up here? Oh, I found my baby Minish. I can go down here. Okay

3311
03:29:59,440 --> 03:30:01,440
Okay, let's go

3312
03:30:01,680 --> 03:30:07,280
I saw that beanstalk so we'll go down there. I don't know where we're heading though. We're heading somewhere anyway

3313
03:30:10,400 --> 03:30:13,200
Hey, we're supposed to go when I'm tiny

3314
03:30:14,640 --> 03:30:16,640
Oh, I see it

3315
03:30:17,440 --> 03:30:24,080
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. This is exactly what we need. Yes. Yes more this please

3316
03:30:28,480 --> 03:30:33,920
Red famo's buff is more limit time, but boost boost it makes you purple just look up

3317
03:30:35,280 --> 03:30:41,360
Has often Mendo for me Nintendo for making us play gacha and then calling us out for it. Honestly

3318
03:30:41,520 --> 03:30:44,960
Oh, that's perfect. That's exactly what we needed

3319
03:30:46,240 --> 03:30:51,600
Oh, sorry mess up cutting the grass. Excuse me. Pardon me. Come through. Oh wait. Is there anything in my house?

3320
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:56,880
There might be I actually so this is your house. Well, it seems like a nice place

3321
03:30:56,960 --> 03:31:00,000
So where's my room? Uh, you don't have a room. You're a hat

3322
03:31:01,680 --> 03:31:03,680
Hi grand papi

3323
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:08,640
Oh, he wants to trade. I'm so glad you're safe link. I hear the terrible things are happening

3324
03:31:08,640 --> 03:31:12,640
By the way, have you been using all of the items you've found if you ever get stuck somewhere?

3325
03:31:12,720 --> 03:31:15,760
Use that trick. Just try everything in your inventory. I love that

3326
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:18,800
Literally just ram your head into the wall until sun happens

3327
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:23,600
What if I miss you fell asleep? Are you gonna sleep? You're allowed to sleep if you need to sleep

3328
03:31:24,080 --> 03:31:28,160
Um, we are now just doing all the little sade activities

3329
03:31:29,360 --> 03:31:34,160
Um, because we're about to hit the end game, but if we hit it

3330
03:31:34,880 --> 03:31:38,800
Oh, it got 20 rupees from that choice. If we hit the end game, then

3331
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:44,960
Uh, a lot of things aren't very nice. So we're gonna try and 100% it like right now

3332
03:31:45,760 --> 03:31:49,040
So this is your room. That makes it my room too, right? Yeah

3333
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:53,920
Hey, aren't you tired? Do you want to take a rest? Sure. Let's go to sleep

3334
03:31:56,720 --> 03:32:02,480
Oh my god, look at us sleeping. We're so cute. Oh my god, Esso looks absolutely gone

3335
03:32:04,400 --> 03:32:05,840
Oh

3336
03:32:05,840 --> 03:32:11,120
Yeah, that was just what I needed to get back in the fight. Let's get going. Oh, we had a little map together

3337
03:32:12,240 --> 03:32:15,760
Best feeler girl step on me. Uh, she be she has heels

3338
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:19,600
She'll make sure it hurts and you say thank you after

3339
03:32:22,160 --> 03:32:26,400
Um, I've already been in here. Haven't we? Yes, it was a heart. That's perfectly fine

3340
03:32:27,280 --> 03:32:34,000
No, no, no, no. Oh, sorry. Um, I um, I've already done this tingling, but just in case

3341
03:32:36,800 --> 03:32:41,440
Yeah, okay. Have you found all the tingling brothers? You can fuse kinstones and we'll have a certain fact

3342
03:32:41,840 --> 03:32:45,760
Tingle is positive. You will get something very very good. Good luck, Mr. Fairy

3343
03:32:45,840 --> 03:32:49,760
Wait, why am I a fairy? Who are you calling a fairy? You're the one dressed up in a freaking

3344
03:32:50,880 --> 03:32:52,880
I can't make that joke, but

3345
03:32:53,840 --> 03:33:00,720
What's this if it shells? Oh, that's how I get my other bottles. That's fantastic

3346
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:03,520
um

3347
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:09,760
There's a beanstalk here that isn't uh growing

3348
03:33:12,800 --> 03:33:16,640
There's a reason tingle calls you a fairy that can't remember. I must be related to other war

3349
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:21,120
Hey, we're going to do a complete backtrack of the woods right now

3350
03:33:22,080 --> 03:33:24,720
Okay, maybe this is the bean

3351
03:33:30,800 --> 03:33:35,600
Yes, it is the bean. Okay, we can literally go straight back to where we just passed. That's perfect

3352
03:33:37,280 --> 03:33:42,160
They call you a fairy because you're also green. You guys are you guys aren't afraid of heights, right?

3353
03:33:43,040 --> 03:33:45,040
You don't be shy

3354
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:48,240
Let me just double check. He's not gonna give me a second one

3355
03:33:48,400 --> 03:33:52,800
Yeah, listen, you remember the bean I posted? Yeah, I do. I saw it cool

3356
03:33:53,680 --> 03:33:58,960
Tingle calls you a fairy because anyone he thinks in green is a fairy because he thinks that's cute

3357
03:33:59,760 --> 03:34:01,760
You look like me. You are me

3358
03:34:02,480 --> 03:34:04,240
Right, time to claim

3359
03:34:04,240 --> 03:34:06,240
Let's see what's up here

3360
03:34:06,800 --> 03:34:10,320
Okay, that's a bit dramatic. I have to admit that's a bit much

3361
03:34:11,440 --> 03:34:13,920
Well, there's a heart up here. So I'll take it

3362
03:34:14,720 --> 03:34:20,800
I need I've got three. I've got 200 rupees. I think I'm gonna max out on rupees. I might buy shells in that case

3363
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:31,120
If we're gonna backtrack should I just 100 guarantee gamba these figures if we're gonna backtrack

3364
03:34:31,200 --> 03:34:34,640
I think we're gonna end up with like tons of shells

3365
03:34:35,360 --> 03:34:40,080
Yeah, I've like wasted a hundred shells with that. We're just gonna do guaranteed pulls

3366
03:34:41,040 --> 03:34:45,280
I shouldn't but if we're gonna backtrack we 100% are gonna get like

3367
03:34:46,400 --> 03:34:49,920
Tons of shells and that was such a waste. Ah, that was such a waste

3368
03:34:51,680 --> 03:34:56,480
Okay, right. Let's see. You want me to do what your back? Yes. I am back. I'm addicted

3369
03:34:57,600 --> 03:35:00,320
How many do I need for 100 probability?

3370
03:35:03,760 --> 03:35:08,640
I'm just gonna do 100 probability because I don't want to gamble like 60 and then not get it

3371
03:35:10,800 --> 03:35:13,680
Let's do 100. Let's do 100. What is it drum roll?

3372
03:35:16,160 --> 03:35:21,760
Fire wizard money gang. I burped when I said that. I don't know if you heard that or the mic may have covered it up

3373
03:35:23,200 --> 03:35:24,480
Okay

3374
03:35:24,480 --> 03:35:28,640
Is there a faster way to do this? No, it's not. I literally have to go all the way up manually

3375
03:35:29,520 --> 03:35:31,520
Big gamba time big gamba

3376
03:35:32,160 --> 03:35:34,160
We're gonna do good

3377
03:35:35,120 --> 03:35:36,720
Okay

3378
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:40,480
74 so I think we get like six pulls and then we're done

3379
03:35:41,920 --> 03:35:47,760
No burp on the mic. No, I did it as I was talking. So I don't know if the mic even heard it

3380
03:35:49,040 --> 03:35:56,080
One for each percent and yeah, the uh, this is rough. So I'm only gonna get like 10 gacha

3381
03:35:56,880 --> 03:35:58,880
new from it

3382
03:35:59,440 --> 03:36:01,440
I

3383
03:36:03,040 --> 03:36:05,040
Now pull that lever I

3384
03:36:06,560 --> 03:36:13,280
What do the figures do in the game it unlocks a location that we need in order to get 100 percent

3385
03:36:13,840 --> 03:36:16,560
So unfortunately, we're kind of stuck doing this right now

3386
03:36:16,880 --> 03:36:24,480
Um, but we are just gonna get rid of our shells because we're about to backtrack and we'll be rewarded with new

3387
03:36:25,440 --> 03:36:32,800
Um, oh was that 99? I swear if that was 99 and we don't get it

3388
03:36:36,800 --> 03:36:38,800
Okay

3389
03:36:42,960 --> 03:36:48,960
It's too easy it's too easy ladies and gentlemen, you're lucky I refrained

3390
03:36:51,040 --> 03:36:53,040
You're so lucky I refrained

3391
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:58,720
I I have so much ability to hold it in okay

3392
03:37:00,640 --> 03:37:02,640
All right, let's see

3393
03:37:02,800 --> 03:37:04,800
In that room is the music play

3394
03:37:05,360 --> 03:37:09,200
Let's play in game music. I believe in that room is the music player

3395
03:37:12,240 --> 03:37:16,960
Yeah, we haven't got I don't actually ever recall getting it before you know that

3396
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:22,000
And

3397
03:37:22,560 --> 03:37:27,760
Oh, you're charging me bro, you are charging me

3398
03:37:29,920 --> 03:37:31,920
77 just for a guarantee

3399
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:40,240
Happy hearth in oh my god, that's such a lovely name for an in

3400
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:44,560
I wouldn't mind. Oh my god. Maybe we should develop an in game

3401
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:49,040
I quite like meta games. I'm really impressed with that. Um

3402
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:54,800
What's the name the team that put together needy streamer overload. I am so impressed

3403
03:37:54,880 --> 03:37:59,600
I really want to look into them and see to produce anything else. I was blown away by that

3404
03:38:00,320 --> 03:38:03,520
Uh, what game did I really enjoy that? Um

3405
03:38:06,640 --> 03:38:08,640
Um that double shitty game

3406
03:38:09,760 --> 03:38:13,760
Oh, I can't I remember it with the nightclub and I had terrible luck on it buckshot relay

3407
03:38:13,840 --> 03:38:17,680
I was very impressed with buckshot relay. I definitely want to look into the dev team

3408
03:38:18,400 --> 03:38:23,120
Although I think it was made by one guy actually, so it'd be interesting to see what other games he came up with

3409
03:38:23,840 --> 03:38:25,840
Um

3410
03:38:26,960 --> 03:38:28,960
I'm out of shells yet

3411
03:38:32,320 --> 03:38:37,120
Buckshot's just one guy literally need see if he's got anything else on the market though like, um

3412
03:38:38,480 --> 03:38:42,240
Definitely put my money where my mouth is type thing like, um

3413
03:38:43,200 --> 03:38:45,200
The more shells you use yes this thing

3414
03:38:45,840 --> 03:38:48,480
Am I out yet? No. No, I can still get more

3415
03:38:49,600 --> 03:38:54,880
Wow, you lose a hundred percent the same. So this is teaching us go big or go home

3416
03:38:56,400 --> 03:38:59,920
I'm addicted to buckshot after watching I did so bad

3417
03:39:00,640 --> 03:39:03,920
But it was funny though stamp a busy hard-working employee

3418
03:39:04,000 --> 03:39:09,040
Although he can be a touch edgy the stamp he uses his own personal ones. Please don't borrow it. Thanks

3419
03:39:09,760 --> 03:39:13,440
I love like the little details like you didn't have to come up with that lore

3420
03:39:13,520 --> 03:39:16,000
But the game was like, yeah, we're gonna make random lore for these times people

3421
03:39:17,280 --> 03:39:19,280
Are we out shells now?

3422
03:39:21,600 --> 03:39:23,600
No

3423
03:39:24,400 --> 03:39:26,720
80 though, bro a

3424
03:39:28,640 --> 03:39:35,280
Any chance for another buckshot relay stream, uh, most likely a member stream if there's any games we want to revisit

3425
03:39:35,920 --> 03:39:41,360
Um, I'm quite happy to do it in members because if you look it might be a bit like, oh, you've already shamed this before type thing

3426
03:39:42,480 --> 03:39:48,800
She says she'll please Viva pinata and cameo shamelessly to back-to-back endurance rooms. Um

3427
03:39:50,800 --> 03:39:57,840
I think I said I got the achievements on Skyrim working again. So we can actually go back to Skyrim in

3428
03:39:58,560 --> 03:40:00,080
July

3429
03:40:00,080 --> 03:40:01,360
Um

3430
03:40:01,360 --> 03:40:08,400
Oh peaceful high rule car loves peaceful high rule scenery. I don't know who car love is but you've got good taste mate

3431
03:40:09,440 --> 03:40:20,080
Uh, you can just carry 990 max. So 10 is 11 pulls. No crashed warp 100 percent. Oh, I'm not sure I have that kind of skill

3432
03:40:20,960 --> 03:40:26,000
I'm not very good. I don't comprehend. It's a child's game, but I'm I don't think I'm that good

3433
03:40:26,880 --> 03:40:28,000
I

3434
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:32,240
How does he know about the minute to make figures exactly?

3435
03:40:33,680 --> 03:40:35,680
minister

3436
03:40:37,360 --> 03:40:40,000
Caval is the figure guy. Oh silly me

3437
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:46,480
Want to try again? I feel like we're now out of shells. We've done quite a lot

3438
03:40:49,600 --> 03:40:51,520
No

3439
03:40:51,520 --> 03:40:54,960
There it is right. Let's do it. Let's just go down to zero shells

3440
03:40:56,000 --> 03:40:58,000
Wish us luck

3441
03:40:58,000 --> 03:41:00,000
What do we pull? What do we pull?

3442
03:41:04,400 --> 03:41:05,920
Malari

3443
03:41:05,920 --> 03:41:08,800
He lives with the seven apprentices in mount carinal

3444
03:41:09,600 --> 03:41:11,440
Serenal

3445
03:41:11,440 --> 03:41:18,000
Carinal which contains all the mineral riches they will ever need. He seems gruff, but he's trustworthy. There we go

3446
03:41:18,480 --> 03:41:23,120
Let's go right. We are officially down and out on shells, which is actually a good thing

3447
03:41:23,760 --> 03:41:32,240
Um, because it means we can now high tweety bird. Um, we can now pick up chests without being worried

You're lucky. I need to empty my pockets

Whoop whoop whoop right we are literally just gonna go back to the start and

3468
03:42:59,200 --> 03:43:02,160
Take it from the tap. Oh, we've not unlocked this

3469
03:43:04,160 --> 03:43:10,800
Wow, we've not unlocked it. How well there seems to be something for digging here. Maybe there's a gore rock that we can trade

3470
03:43:10,800 --> 03:43:12,800
I

3471
03:43:16,080 --> 03:43:18,080
Let me be fellow beast

3472
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:28,000
50 not bad not bad not bad a kinsome piece not bad. Okay. That was a quick one very quick one

3473
03:43:28,240 --> 03:43:30,800
Yeah, it sounds like seven or eight rupees to a shell

3474
03:43:31,440 --> 03:43:34,400
Extortionate well, I know what business we're opening up reflands

3475
03:43:34,960 --> 03:43:37,760
In order to pay for the farm because are you joking me?

3476
03:43:38,480 --> 03:43:43,680
Are you joking me? Is there anything hidden in here anything hidden in here? Nope just a minute

3477
03:43:50,240 --> 03:43:56,320
A red piece I'll absolutely take a red piece. I keep forgetting that the chest can also have

3478
03:43:58,320 --> 03:44:00,320
A other stuff in them

3479
03:44:01,760 --> 03:44:03,760
Kinsome piece

3480
03:44:05,440 --> 03:44:07,440
That's not one shot

3481
03:44:08,480 --> 03:44:10,480
I

3482
03:44:10,800 --> 03:44:12,800
Nothing in here, which is fine

3483
03:44:13,920 --> 03:44:16,080
Right, we'll go we and then we'll go to the minish

3484
03:44:17,440 --> 03:44:20,800
Strone could sell them for more because her pretty cool

3485
03:44:23,280 --> 03:44:25,680
Did the minish sound like naikor when they talk?

3486
03:44:28,240 --> 03:44:33,680
Don't ever type again. That's the funniest thing I've seen all day. That's hilarious, but don't type again

3487
03:44:34,320 --> 03:44:36,320
What the fuck?

3488
03:44:37,120 --> 03:44:41,040
Do they sound like naikor? Oh my god

3489
03:44:42,320 --> 03:44:44,720
That's really funny, but don't talk again

3490
03:44:47,280 --> 03:44:49,280

3493
03:44:58,240 --> 03:45:00,240
Naikor

3494
03:45:00,400 --> 03:45:02,400
Don't speak

3495
03:45:02,480 --> 03:45:04,480
I use the shells first that would add value

3496
03:45:05,200 --> 03:45:10,240
Wait, why is there water unless there's something in the water because why would you put that here?

3497
03:45:13,200 --> 03:45:15,200
No, you didn't there's nothing here

3498
03:45:17,680 --> 03:45:22,480
Am I being trolled why would you put these here if there's nothing in the water?

3499
03:45:25,440 --> 03:45:30,640
I'm being trolled I fell for it have foolish the egg is on my face

3500
03:45:31,600 --> 03:45:34,400
The gamer instincts has failed us truly

3501
03:45:36,880 --> 03:45:42,480
There's something over here. Oh my god. No, he's all alone over here. Are you okay buddy?

3502
03:45:42,880 --> 03:45:47,360
Wow good job finding this place. There aren't many people who visit me. Wait, you don't want to trade or anything

3503
03:45:47,520 --> 03:45:49,520
Is there nothing special? Is it in the water?

3504
03:45:51,040 --> 03:45:56,320
It's in the water, isn't it? It's in the water. Are you sure you don't want to do a kinstone fusion?

3505
03:45:56,720 --> 03:45:58,720
Oh

3506
03:45:59,040 --> 03:46:01,040
What's in the water come on?

3507
03:46:02,240 --> 03:46:04,240
Must be in the water

3508
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:17,040
Talk to the minish in the barrel shaped house, okay

3509
03:46:17,200 --> 03:46:26,720
Hmm, maybe I unlock a chest at his house or something and we'll come a bit too early

3510
03:46:28,240 --> 03:46:30,240
With our timing

3511
03:46:33,760 --> 03:46:34,960
Hello

3512
03:46:34,960 --> 03:46:38,560
You've heard of the travelers of feng kinstone get really lucky. Well, that's thanks to that

3513
03:46:38,560 --> 03:46:45,200
It's made by husband as you see we thrive on making humans happy. Oh, that's so precious. Hi, buddy

3514
03:46:45,920 --> 03:46:51,040
Sometimes if a flower seed and sometimes it's a stone we hide our lucky items and all sorts of unexpected places

3515
03:46:51,040 --> 03:46:53,040
But the real trick is making it tough for humans

3516
03:46:54,240 --> 03:46:55,840
Kawaii ne

3517
03:46:55,840 --> 03:46:59,520
Relayer, thank you for coming to replaying. I appreciate it. Hi buddy. Hello

3518
03:47:00,080 --> 03:47:05,760
We're doing cutting edge research on bloom. You see that plant with a little bud. We're working on waste and privet

3519
03:47:05,840 --> 03:47:07,840
Do you need water?

3520
03:47:08,800 --> 03:47:10,800
Uh, if you need

3521
03:47:10,960 --> 03:47:14,880
No, okay, that's not real water. Are you real water? Nope. You're not real water

3522
03:47:16,160 --> 03:47:19,760
And there's no water on the side talk to him again. Oh

3523
03:47:22,000 --> 03:47:26,320
What do you mean he doesn't instantly tell me what to do? Oh, I need milk

3524
03:47:27,680 --> 03:47:29,680
You need milk

3525
03:47:29,760 --> 03:47:32,720
Could you have asked me for that before I came all the way to these parts?

3526
03:47:33,360 --> 03:47:36,000
Okay, we'll come back with milk soon to yem, but not yet

3527
03:47:38,000 --> 03:47:42,400
Uh, as far as I'm aware, none of the houses have anything

3528
03:47:43,120 --> 03:47:45,120
And

3529
03:47:45,920 --> 03:47:50,240
I was born and raised here. So I don't know much about those. I hear there are huge green monsters in the woods

3530
03:47:50,240 --> 03:47:53,440
I can't believe they made it through. Oh, I can't believe you made it through their life. That's right

3531
03:47:54,080 --> 03:47:56,080
He needs some azura

3532
03:47:56,800 --> 03:47:58,800
We need some

3533
03:48:00,800 --> 03:48:02,960
So how is old yes, yes, he was fine

3534
03:48:03,520 --> 03:48:09,760
Right, we'll come back to the minish village with milk. What a request. Well, what else do you want sugar while I'm at it?

3535
03:48:09,760 --> 03:48:11,760

3538
03:48:15,280 --> 03:48:19,120
Okay, he does want to fuse that's good. Oh, I should maybe talk to that other one

3539
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:23,040
He might want to fuse an important piece as well. Can we have yours instead?

3540
03:48:28,080 --> 03:48:30,080
He needs green water from the mountain

3541
03:48:30,240 --> 03:48:34,640
You know what would be great a bomb that went off when you only wanted actually I could make that now. Oh

3542
03:48:36,400 --> 03:48:38,720
Okay, well, we're actually about to go talk to him. Thank you, mate

3543
03:48:39,200 --> 03:48:42,240
I'm gonna talk to the old geezer from over here

03:48:51,440 --> 03:48:53,440
You don't want to trade

3547
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:00,800
Thank you, thank you

3548
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:02,400
You have saved me

3549
03:49:02,400 --> 03:49:04,400
Someone calls us that we have a good green

3550
03:49:05,360 --> 03:49:11,760
Right, he is happy with all our trading man. I love I'm sorry. I said this was the first time we walked there

3551
03:49:11,760 --> 03:49:17,840
I love this kind of pixel art. It's just so adorable. It's so roomy. It's so cute. It's so kawaii

3552
03:49:19,440 --> 03:49:21,440
Pardon me. All right remote bombs

3553
03:49:22,480 --> 03:49:25,680
You aren't normal begin. Just try that. Do we want remote bombs?

3554
03:49:30,400 --> 03:49:32,400
Maybe

3555
03:49:32,480 --> 03:49:35,120
Sure, sure. Give me remote bombs. Why not?

3556
03:49:37,360 --> 03:49:40,720
All right, let's wait. Well, let's fuse. Oh red. So it's important

3557
03:49:41,920 --> 03:49:47,200
I'm like, hmm. Do we actually want to thank you again Rilaire for coming in below? I appreciate

Yeah, that swamp is absolutely filled to the brim with items like stuff that we're gonna need to pick up

3561
03:49:59,600 --> 03:50:01,600
It's gonna take us a hot thing

And we need green likewise for these

3565
03:50:14,320 --> 03:50:15,840

Had to go to the store

3567
03:50:18,080 --> 03:50:20,240
Well, we're about to go to the store in game

3568
03:50:21,920 --> 03:50:25,280

3572
03:50:43,520 --> 03:50:46,080
So we're gonna get milk first

3573
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:50,400

Need milk straight from the source

3580
03:51:02,960 --> 03:51:07,120
Yes, please. Oh, hello there. I'm selling nutritious milk. Please give me milk

3581

Right, I'm gonna buy

3583
03:51:12,880 --> 03:51:20,000
Shells again because we've got we're already at 500. We just spent all our rupees and we're already back at 500 again

3584
03:51:20,880 --> 03:51:23,120
Uh, so it might as well put it on the gamble

3585
03:51:24,480 --> 03:51:26,480
Yes, bye, please

3586
03:51:27,200 --> 03:51:30,320
It's her milk cart a cow-shaped chariot. Oh, is that actually

We will inspect it while we go pick up the green

3588
03:51:34,560 --> 03:51:36,560
the green goo

3589
03:51:36,560 --> 03:51:38,560
Oh, ah, I keep doing that

3590
03:51:38,960 --> 03:51:42,400
It doesn't seem to register instantly that I want to talk to him. There we go

3591
03:51:44,480 --> 03:51:48,080
Strongly you also should buy the gorgon pieces at the post office

3592
03:51:50,480 --> 03:51:54,560
I'm gonna be so poor by the end we do all this quest and we can go make it

3593
03:51:55,440 --> 03:52:00,560
Right, how much coin? Okay, we have 150. I'm just gonna catch a one right now

3594
03:52:01,600 --> 03:52:05,040
What am I designed to be get? Let's see. Oh, you're back. Yeah, I'm back

3595
03:52:06,800 --> 03:52:11,920
Uh, well a probability is 18. That's horrific probability

3596
03:52:12,800 --> 03:52:13,920
Hey

3597
03:52:13,920 --> 03:52:17,680
odds 83 for a confirmed

3598
03:52:19,600 --> 03:52:21,600
Well again

3599
03:52:21,840 --> 03:52:29,680
Tingling tingle siblings tingle and green and his twin younger brothers ankle and

3600
03:52:30,400 --> 03:52:33,760
Knuckle they believe infusing will help meet the fairies

3601
03:52:33,760 --> 03:52:39,920
So they are recording kinsome data on their maps. David junior is not technically a relic stop

3602
03:52:40,560 --> 03:52:43,040
That's bizarre. I love whatever that was

3603
03:52:43,680 --> 03:52:45,920
There's like always not actually related to us. Okay

3604
03:52:47,280 --> 03:52:49,280
Right, let's go get green milk next

3605
03:52:50,000 --> 03:52:53,680
Uh, excuse me pup. Oh, you do this every time buddy

3606
03:53:00,160 --> 03:53:02,160
Oh, there's so much over here we need to

3607
03:53:02,960 --> 03:53:07,520
Do we just do it all at once? Why not? Why not? Why not? We'll just do all at once. Okay

3608
03:53:08,720 --> 03:53:11,760
What's this? Okay, very good very good

3609
03:53:11,840 --> 03:53:13,840
Hmm

3610
03:53:17,920 --> 03:53:19,920
Well, it seems like it's gonna take me down. Oh

3611
03:53:22,320 --> 03:53:24,320
No, no trading

3612
03:53:25,440 --> 03:53:26,960
There is

3613
03:53:26,960 --> 03:53:32,240
Well, I'll grab one now that we're gonna need it at this point in time, but we will come back to get

3614
03:53:35,360 --> 03:53:37,360
Oh, I love this song

3615
03:53:37,520 --> 03:53:40,960
Oh already came back already came back

3616
03:53:44,720 --> 03:53:48,240
All right, there is one here

3617
03:53:55,440 --> 03:54:03,040
Actually, we're gonna check that the the gorgon things aren't here because they might be the

3618
03:54:03,840 --> 03:54:05,840
Kinstone trading that we need to do

3619
03:54:06,800 --> 03:54:08,800
Oh, there is

3620
03:54:09,520 --> 03:54:11,520
Oh, we have 10 pieces of the one they've won

3621
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:15,200
They all work from home analyst. Yeah

3622
03:54:15,840 --> 03:54:18,880
Although he needs one more friend and he can get to the next location

3623
03:54:19,520 --> 03:54:22,160
Are they all gonna hang out in the cave? Hmm. This wall's pretty tough

3624
03:54:22,160 --> 03:54:25,280
I don't think the two of us can break it, but that doesn't stop me

3625
03:54:29,520 --> 03:54:31,520
Right

3626
03:54:32,240 --> 03:54:34,240
Oh

3627
03:54:34,560 --> 03:54:40,880
I thought I smelled some gorgons around here. What are you guys up to buddy? We miss you. Hey, give us a hand breaking through

3628
03:54:42,320 --> 03:54:46,400
Bunk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk, but they still need one more to break this big wall

3629
03:54:48,320 --> 03:54:54,960
Okay, that's fine. So there's a chest here. We're gonna go get that because we're coming back for it

3630
03:54:58,800 --> 03:55:00,800
Thankfully

3631
03:55:02,000 --> 03:55:05,760
Bit cheeky money so we can put it on our cheeky gacha. Don't mind me. Oh

3632
03:55:08,000 --> 03:55:11,840
Oh speaking of a tingling you were up here hiding from what?

3633
03:55:15,120 --> 03:55:18,640
Do you may perhaps have any other piece for no reason at all?

3634
03:55:19,280 --> 03:55:20,720
Please game

3635
03:55:20,720 --> 03:55:22,320
Please game

3636
03:55:22,320 --> 03:55:25,040
For no other reason at all. Give us something else

3637
03:55:26,160 --> 03:55:28,560
No way that one piece is what I need

3638
03:55:28,640 --> 03:55:34,560
You want to fuse I absolutely do well, I know I have that piece because I just saw it

3639
03:55:35,920 --> 03:55:39,680
Literally out of all the pieces you could ask for should you come in a gambler?

3640
03:55:40,640 --> 03:55:42,640
No

3641
03:55:42,640 --> 03:55:44,640
Just a weeble

3642
03:55:59,520 --> 03:56:01,520
Yeah

3643
03:56:01,920 --> 03:56:05,680
I did not pay attention to what location that is tribally hills

3644
03:56:07,760 --> 03:56:09,760
All those good old

3645
03:56:10,320 --> 03:56:13,840
Yay, they fit I wonder what that means. Oh, yeah, you wonder what it means if they fit together

3646
03:56:14,160 --> 03:56:17,120
Did you ever check out that warrior? No, I didn't do it yet. Please. Please

3647
03:56:18,400 --> 03:56:22,400
Surely I'll get a kinstone piece from cutting the grass surely

3648
03:56:23,680 --> 03:56:24,800
Copium

3649
03:56:24,800 --> 03:56:26,560

3650
03:56:26,560 --> 03:56:29,200
Surely one kinstone feet. Yeah, you're a fuck it. We'll come back later

3651
03:56:30,880 --> 03:56:32,880
Right green milk time. No

3652
03:56:34,080 --> 03:56:36,080

Bomb the la wait. Do you want to fuse stones? No

3657
03:56:58,320 --> 03:57:00,320
Dig at the farmhouse for pieces

3658
03:57:01,600 --> 03:57:04,400
I just make oh, there's the green liquid

3659
03:57:06,560 --> 03:57:09,600
Okay, thankfully it's not that far away. I think probably already bombed that

3660
03:57:12,560 --> 03:57:19,600
Because I'm I'm playing messily. I'm playing messily. Oh my gosh. Goodbye. Don't care. Not my problem

3661
03:57:20,560 --> 03:57:22,560
Not my problem

3662
03:57:23,040 --> 03:57:25,040
Right at least we can do

3663
03:57:27,680 --> 03:57:29,680
You know what these are all in my way

3664
03:57:32,080 --> 03:57:34,480
Absolutely steamrolled. Oh, oh

3665
03:57:36,400 --> 03:57:38,400
No, okay. Well, it was worth the shot

3666
03:57:39,680 --> 03:57:43,600
Give me that. No, um, no don't fly me halfway across the map

3667
03:57:45,840 --> 03:57:47,840
We have milk we have green

3668
03:57:48,800 --> 03:57:53,120
I don't even know of any other liquid that we could need that I need a syrup

3669
03:57:56,000 --> 03:57:58,000
Link has become

3670
03:57:58,480 --> 03:58:01,360
Gardner destroyer boss. Right. We can at least do this

3671
03:58:02,400 --> 03:58:04,400
We'll come back to mount cereal later

3672
03:58:05,680 --> 03:58:08,560
Um, this one. Yes

3673
03:58:10,880 --> 03:58:13,140
We've got Nickelodeon slained honestly

3674
03:58:18,240 --> 03:58:20,240
Oh

3675
03:58:23,120 --> 03:58:25,440
Sorry, I ain't put these on because it's just so much faster

3676
03:58:25,760 --> 03:58:29,440
Look, I don't mean to come through your house with like my dirty shoes and my sword out

3677
03:58:29,520 --> 03:58:34,960
But so it's just so much faster going everywhere. I think the last one is either a red or blue potion. You know what?

3678
03:58:35,680 --> 03:58:38,480
You know what? I've just fucking go all this way

3679
03:58:39,440 --> 03:58:43,280
Have I missed your messages and chat telling me that I've just come all this way and he's

3680
03:58:43,600 --> 03:58:45,600
Come back again

3681
03:58:46,400 --> 03:58:49,600
It's fine. I'm actually not that mad. I'm enjoying this. I need milk

3682
03:58:50,720 --> 03:58:54,000
Wait, you've got milk. Yes. I brought it for you. It's all for you, buddy

3683
03:58:55,200 --> 03:58:56,960
Thanks, I can do my research

3684
03:58:56,960 --> 03:59:02,000
Great, and then I'll leave and then I'll come back in and they will have bloomed beautifully

3685
03:59:03,120 --> 03:59:08,320
Nope, they have not bloomed. Okay. Uh, let's try that again. Uh new bloom come back soon

3686
03:59:14,000 --> 03:59:23,120
Okay, I guess we'll do something else

3687
03:59:26,080 --> 03:59:30,400
Needs time but time isn't actually this game isn't actually timed

3688
03:59:34,080 --> 03:59:38,080
It takes five in game minutes, but well if we need

3689
03:59:39,520 --> 03:59:41,920
We'll go to the top of the forest then instead

3690
03:59:44,000 --> 03:59:46,000
I

3691
03:59:46,480 --> 03:59:50,640
Didn't even yeah, I didn't even know this time this game was like time

3692
03:59:52,080 --> 03:59:58,400
Oh, I'm gonna have to get my blank game cut in circulation off of my leg. Ow that hurts. I don't I never noticed the pain until

3693
04:00:00,640 --> 04:00:02,640
Till it's too late

3694
04:00:02,720 --> 04:00:08,880
Wait, am I supposed to? No, sorry. Sorry. I just I just literally juked that bird. I'm so sorry, Mr. Bird

3695

3696
04:00:14,320 --> 04:00:16,320

Not unlocked that clearly

3698
04:00:20,400 --> 04:00:22,400
What if I talk to this guy though?

3699
04:00:26,160 --> 04:00:29,040
Broke that bird's ankles literally juked him out

3700

3706
04:00:57,280 --> 04:00:59,280
Okay, we're making progress

3707

Take care of the legs. We need them

3708
04:01:02,400 --> 04:01:06,160
The stream's so relaxing. Oh wait until I get into a fight and then it's over

Oh, we did it. We did it. We did it fantastic

3714
04:01:26,080 --> 04:01:28,080
Maybe

3715
04:01:28,960 --> 04:01:30,960
This place is massive

3716
04:01:32,320 --> 04:01:35,440
I can't even see if there's any enemies, you know

3717
04:01:38,000 --> 04:01:40,000
Wow this place is humongous

3718
04:01:42,160 --> 04:01:44,160
Humongous what

3719
04:01:45,200 --> 04:01:47,200
We

04:01:47,440 --> 04:01:49,440
Where the heck am I going?

3721
04:01:50,960 --> 04:01:52,960
Is there a gorgon piece?

3722
04:01:54,400 --> 04:01:58,320
Whoa, I didn't realize I had a vicinity type thing. Is there a gorgon piece here?

3723

If I just ignore it, can it hurt me? Yeah, it can't hurt. Oh jack in the bean. Stop

Would you climb my beam? Sorry. Don't don't answer that. Don't answer that

3726
04:02:14,000 --> 04:02:19,040
Also, Strani, I want you to know how you sit as rude circulation like it's caught off

3727
04:02:19,280 --> 04:02:22,160
I lean with my legs against the desk, but I lean

So hard. Oh, we got heart piece. That's fantastic. I lean so hard

Um with me, but I could take a picture and show you but like I absolutely destroy the circulation

Like there's indents as red as anything right now. It's really bad

3732
04:02:42,000 --> 04:02:45,280
It's 10 million uh runes enough for sure to keep farming

3733
04:02:46,240 --> 04:02:48,240

04:02:52,480 --> 04:02:54,480

Uh, is there a merchie today? Is there a merch in dice today?

3737
04:03:00,320 --> 04:03:02,320
Leg down is real

3738
04:03:03,520 --> 04:03:05,520
Wow right, where did that?

3739
04:03:09,120 --> 04:03:13,120
No, okay. Well, there was something down here

3740
04:03:14,400 --> 04:03:16,400
I can't see those

3741
04:03:17,520 --> 04:03:20,960
I can't see if there's an enemy so I'm just like swiping into nothing

3742
04:03:21,840 --> 04:03:23,840
Okay

3743
04:03:24,160 --> 04:03:29,360
Oh, there's a chest. Okay. Okay. It paid off. It paid off. It paid off. Don't worry about it

3744
04:03:34,720 --> 04:03:39,280
Okay, I like that gorgon gorgon gorgon gorgon gorgon

3745
04:03:40,080 --> 04:03:43,840
Sorry, I'm very excited to help see all his buddies come together to help

3746
04:03:44,240 --> 04:03:50,880
It's 10 million runes enough. Alright level up don't don't lose your runes

3747
04:03:52,880 --> 04:03:54,880
Oh, they're gonna do

3748
04:03:54,960 --> 04:03:59,680
They're gonna break a wall. Yes, is there any cheaper doing fall guys? Uh, mercy

3749
04:04:01,760 --> 04:04:07,200
I don't know. I think you showed us some marks on your foot on the swiss room. Yeah, that's gym

3750
04:04:08,640 --> 04:04:10,240
That's for

3751
04:04:10,240 --> 04:04:13,280
Stimulian not in that way. That's like for

3752
04:04:14,400 --> 04:04:20,400
Stamming on my feet. I have permanent scars on my ill-fee bows because of that. That's just me

3753
04:04:21,440 --> 04:04:27,200
Uh, right, that was good. We went this way now. We just need to go up and then we have finished whatever location this is

3754
04:04:28,560 --> 04:04:34,160
T-minus five hours for mercy. Can I complete the game in five hours and 100% it? I actually do not know

3755
04:04:35,120 --> 04:04:37,120
Wow, this is a big cavern

3756
04:04:37,760 --> 04:04:42,240
Big cavern. We should have picked up them butterflies that sped things up a bit

3757
04:04:43,040 --> 04:04:45,200
Where is this that want to come out here?

3758
04:04:46,320 --> 04:04:49,360
Oh, I I want to come out here. Thank you

3759
04:04:51,040 --> 04:04:53,040
Like this just in case you fall in the water

3760
04:04:54,160 --> 04:04:56,160
Must be

3761
04:04:58,160 --> 04:05:02,400
Yeah, okay, there's nothing hitting the wall. Wow. Okay, that was good. I like that

3762
04:05:03,360 --> 04:05:05,760
Any other child you want to play in the future?

3763
04:05:05,920 --> 04:05:12,320
Um, cameo and viva pinata are coming up in july. I'm going to focus on getting a butt ton of gamer score

3764
04:05:13,120 --> 04:05:14,480
um

3765
04:05:14,480 --> 04:05:16,480
So it will take me a hot second to

3766
04:05:17,200 --> 04:05:19,520
Get that where the heck are we going?

3767
04:05:20,320 --> 04:05:22,320
We're going so long

3768
04:05:23,920 --> 04:05:25,920
Is it stairwell?

3769
04:05:26,800 --> 04:05:29,440
No, it's a chest. What is it? What's inside?

3770
04:05:30,080 --> 04:05:34,720
Okay, I'll take the shells because we do need them. So I'm not that mad. Okay. I'm not that mad

3771
04:05:37,040 --> 04:05:39,600
Castle crashers could definitely see that

3772
04:05:40,800 --> 04:05:45,760
We've got a four man collab coming up. Um on uno

3773
04:05:47,040 --> 04:05:48,720
um

3774
04:05:48,720 --> 04:05:50,720
And then I think emmy broke the news

3775
04:05:52,560 --> 04:05:54,560
If I'm not mistaken

3776
04:05:55,120 --> 04:05:58,960
Question mark, hopefully should it break the news or I'm breaking the news and it's not really meant to break

3777
04:05:59,680 --> 04:06:05,200
Um, oh, that'll be the freaking piece that strip it hanging. Um

3778
04:06:07,520 --> 04:06:09,520
So did I go up there as a wean?

3779
04:06:11,280 --> 04:06:13,280
Oh, did I go in here?

3780
04:06:15,600 --> 04:06:17,600
Can't get me no

3781
04:06:18,880 --> 04:06:20,880
Oh, I've already been in here. Okay

3782
04:06:21,760 --> 04:06:28,720
Oh, keep talking nobody explodes can be fun. That is not a game for me. I tried it, but I'm like

3783
04:06:31,200 --> 04:06:35,760
Different strokes for different folks. Oh, whoa steady on refunds

3784
04:06:37,920 --> 04:06:40,320
Yeah, what's this? Can I train with you? Yeah

3785
04:06:41,280 --> 04:06:43,280
Are you the one that rejected me?

3786
04:06:43,360 --> 04:06:47,200
I you have found if you train with me. Would you like to train? Yes

3787
04:06:47,760 --> 04:06:51,200
We're gonna learn something new now. You will learn a dangerous technique for day

3788
04:06:51,680 --> 04:06:57,840
The peril beam first you must have only one heart second use your last and some strength and swing your sword. That's it

3789
04:06:58,320 --> 04:07:00,160
Yes, I understand

3790
04:07:00,160 --> 04:07:03,440
So there's no turning back for one must feel the technique

3791
04:07:04,960 --> 04:07:06,960
Position

3792
04:07:10,400 --> 04:07:15,200
Oh, so it comes back if I'm on one health, okay, I comprehend

3793
04:07:15,760 --> 04:07:23,760
Okay, we've got another scroll. That's good. That's good. What do you need? Oh something new something new

3794
04:07:29,360 --> 04:07:35,680
Oh, where's that top left before the grave area

3795
04:07:35,920 --> 04:07:41,360
What's in say North Hyrule Field, yeah

3796
04:07:42,560 --> 04:07:46,960
Okay, do you trade anymore or teach me anymore or is that you taught me everything, you know

3797
04:07:47,920 --> 04:07:53,040
Now there's nothing more I can teach you. Okay. There is one in the swamp that can teach us something

3798
04:07:54,560 --> 04:07:57,360
All right, we are just gonna jump in the water

3799
04:07:58,880 --> 04:08:00,720
We grab

3800
04:08:00,720 --> 04:08:03,760
As if that thing just aim bought on the arse

3801
04:08:06,240 --> 04:08:08,240
Oh

3802
04:08:12,480 --> 04:08:14,480
I'm trying to remember

3803
04:08:17,760 --> 04:08:19,760
Have we done this properly

3804
04:08:21,840 --> 04:08:29,440
Max health or one. Yeah below limit do that sort of thing now. I know this is how we got to this location

3805
04:08:30,160 --> 04:08:32,160
But

3806
04:08:35,200 --> 04:08:38,080
I just want to check there's not a gorgon tree

3807
04:08:39,840 --> 04:08:41,840
Stop

3808
04:08:42,000 --> 04:08:46,560
Wrapping me up. Uh, okay, so we have done it in this area

3809
04:08:47,920 --> 04:08:52,720
So we just need to know is that the only one in this area then?

3810
04:08:54,320 --> 04:08:56,320
Will this be a chest?

3811
04:08:56,320 --> 04:08:58,320
Yeah, okay chest

3812
04:09:00,080 --> 04:09:04,960
Um, wait, am I losing it?

3813
04:09:09,200 --> 04:09:13,760
Am I losing it? I think I'm losing it. Oh, well, whatever. Uh, we've already traded the gorgons

3814
04:09:13,760 --> 04:09:19,520
We don't need to anything else in here. Uh, we'll go small and navigate the map as a wee one

3815
04:09:22,080 --> 04:09:28,160
Uh, we'll just double check this little minish in here. Is there a minish in here?

3816
04:09:30,080 --> 04:09:32,080
I

3817
04:09:32,400 --> 04:09:35,600
Forget that we can swim so I don't need to deal with that lily pad anymore

3818
04:09:39,520 --> 04:09:44,240
Famous last words bro famous last words don't kill us

3819
04:09:46,880 --> 04:09:50,640
Oh, but we need to make triple quadruple sure because if we win a hundred percent in the game

3820
04:09:50,640 --> 04:09:52,640
We need to go all the way and uh

3821
04:09:53,680 --> 04:09:56,720
At least I can swim back and I don't need to deal with it

3822
04:09:57,680 --> 04:09:59,680
But over there yeah, jeez

3823
04:10:00,480 --> 04:10:02,480
There we go. Was there

3824
04:10:03,760 --> 04:10:06,640
No, there's literally not even a minish here, so I've wasted my time

3825
04:10:08,320 --> 04:10:10,320
Okay, we can do this at least

3826
04:10:11,920 --> 04:10:15,200
Oh, you have got to be absolutely kidding me

3827
04:10:17,040 --> 04:10:19,040
They did that to me twice

3828
04:10:19,520 --> 04:10:21,520
They do this to me every time

3829
04:10:22,160 --> 04:10:24,160
Oh

3830
04:10:24,480 --> 04:10:26,480
Now we may have already done

3831
04:10:27,040 --> 04:10:29,520
I think I've actually already done whatever this is up ahead

3832
04:10:30,080 --> 04:10:32,240
But just to make sure just to make sure

3833
04:10:32,720 --> 04:10:36,720
Oh, no, no, no, okay. Thanks. Thanks for no thanks already done it

3834
04:10:38,080 --> 04:10:40,080
All right, let me just go back

3835
04:10:40,480 --> 04:10:43,920
Oh my god, I love that. I'm like a tiny little speck on the screen as well

3836
04:10:45,440 --> 04:10:49,360
Did we do the one that's over here?

3837
04:10:52,240 --> 04:10:54,240
Wait, was there not one over here?

3838
04:10:57,840 --> 04:10:59,840
I'm going crazy

3839
04:11:08,320 --> 04:11:12,720
We already did this one just to make triple sure

3840
04:11:14,080 --> 04:11:16,080
Okay, did you want to fuse

3841
04:11:17,520 --> 04:11:19,840
You hear it steal my bean aren't you?

3842
04:11:21,840 --> 04:11:23,840
It's yours

3843
04:11:25,520 --> 04:11:28,320
Um, I thought is it this side?

3844
04:11:32,160 --> 04:11:37,920
Oh, yeah, we've not done this we didn't have the light source what we do now

3845
04:11:42,880 --> 04:11:44,880
Oh, ah

3846
04:11:48,720 --> 04:11:50,720
All right

3847
04:11:52,480 --> 04:11:55,680
Do not fall off because it takes me like half an hour to get back up

3848
04:12:00,320 --> 04:12:05,760
Okay, not bad not bad. I like this cave. I like this cave because it's not difficult. I like it

3849
04:12:06,400 --> 04:12:08,400
I guess a kingstone piece

3850
04:12:08,400 --> 04:12:10,880
Uh, it'll be important. It'll be important. That's fine

3851
04:12:11,840 --> 04:12:16,560
Right, why would you give me water if there's nothing hidden in here? Hmm, but there's nothing in here

3852
04:12:22,240 --> 04:12:24,240
Red red

3853
04:12:26,000 --> 04:12:30,400
Oh, right. Okay. So we've got that kingstone piece. I'm sure it means we can do something

3854
04:12:31,040 --> 04:12:33,040
Get bean done. How dare you

3855
04:12:33,840 --> 04:12:35,840
I'm guessing I can oh I can

3856
04:12:36,480 --> 04:12:39,840
Am I supposed to be no, I was gonna say I don't think I'm supposed to be tiny here

3857
04:12:44,320 --> 04:12:50,240
All right, I can't go up there. I've just been there. I've been there. Wasn't there something bottom left? Am I losing it?

3858
04:12:51,520 --> 04:12:53,520
I

3859
04:12:55,040 --> 04:12:57,040
There's a crack there

3860
04:12:57,920 --> 04:12:59,920
How would I get to the crack?

3861
04:13:01,200 --> 04:13:06,080
Up here. No, I can't take the stairs. I'm too weak for the stairs. Sorry

3862
04:13:08,160 --> 04:13:11,440
Well, I'm about as ready as I can possibly see for shadow the earth tree

3863
04:13:12,480 --> 04:13:17,680
And I've already been there. I can't take the stairs right. I think I've done everything I possibly can in this area

3864
04:13:18,480 --> 04:13:20,480
Which I'm fine with

3865
04:13:21,520 --> 04:13:23,520
You could do

3866
04:13:26,640 --> 04:13:28,640
Am I sure that's everything I can do though

3867
04:13:29,920 --> 04:13:34,400
Oh, I feel like I'm missing something but whoa, I don't know

3868
04:13:36,800 --> 04:13:42,080
Uh, then he can what I'm missing but it's okay. It's okay. We'll get through it

3869
04:13:42,080 --> 04:13:44,080
Okay

3870
04:13:52,080 --> 04:13:54,880
Oh, we need to explore long long ranch which I've no done

3871
04:13:55,920 --> 04:13:58,080
Oh, we need to explore the whole map which I've no done

3872
04:14:01,440 --> 04:14:06,480
Oh, there's the tingling there. How'd I get to you on the ranch? I need to go in the ram ranch

3873
04:14:06,800 --> 04:14:08,800
But

3874
04:14:10,400 --> 04:14:18,480
What does going small do it puts me in there, but I don't need that you guys have hearts. Oh, you do actually surprisingly

3875
04:14:22,160 --> 04:14:25,600
Uh, I've not done mount serially

3876
04:14:29,120 --> 04:14:31,120
Hmm

3877
04:14:31,120 --> 04:14:34,800
I oh I've already done this. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's fine. Um

3878
04:14:37,440 --> 04:14:40,960
Ah, okay. Okay, we're getting somewhere we're getting somewhere

3879
04:14:42,800 --> 04:14:44,800
Something new

3880
04:14:46,080 --> 04:14:48,080
I'm so cute in pixel form

3881
04:14:49,840 --> 04:14:51,440
Whoopsies

3882
04:14:51,440 --> 04:14:54,720
Okay, red. Perfect. We need it for future trees

3883
04:14:55,360 --> 04:15:01,440
And art you never have three. I need one more. Oh, that's fantastic. Oh, those are the worms

3884
04:15:02,960 --> 04:15:04,960
That's the first time I've ever seen the dang one

3885
04:15:06,720 --> 04:15:08,720
Uh, I assume

3886
04:15:11,280 --> 04:15:15,120
Yes, sorry my stomach just internally farted if you heard that one

3887
04:15:16,240 --> 04:15:18,960
Yeah, you like that. You like hearing my stomach internally farting

3888
04:15:20,960 --> 04:15:26,320
Are you gonna move mister? You know what puddle of water in the middle of the pasture. There's something hidden under it. Yes

3889
04:15:27,760 --> 04:15:29,760
Are you gonna get out of the way? Thank you

3890
04:15:30,800 --> 04:15:32,800
Thank you

3891
04:15:33,760 --> 04:15:38,240
Okay, I think if I talk to this cow there has to be a kinstone piece because why would the game want me to come

3892
04:15:38,240 --> 04:15:43,040
All the way over. Oh, that was too close. I thought I'd be ground chuck for sure. Wait

3893
04:15:44,320 --> 04:15:46,320
Oh, I can't do anything

3894
04:15:48,240 --> 04:15:54,080
That's it. I'm picking up this pot and throwing out when I'm tiny. Wait, so there was a waste of I didn't need to do any of this

3895
04:15:55,440 --> 04:15:58,800
Oh, well. Oh, well, we tried we tried. What's this?

3896
04:15:59,760 --> 04:16:02,000
Water dish that we can swim through baby

3897
04:16:03,200 --> 04:16:08,960
Is there like anything not that's a dead end right? Okay cows. Don't block me. I'm just trying to get back, okay

3898
04:16:10,160 --> 04:16:11,920
I said don't

3899
04:16:11,920 --> 04:16:15,040
Don't do it. I have to wait on this cow moving away

3900
04:16:16,240 --> 04:16:18,240
Yes. Yes. Keep going

3901
04:16:19,280 --> 04:16:21,280
I'll bite your ankles like a herder

3902
04:16:28,400 --> 04:16:30,960
Oh my god, is there a high she's a goat

3903
04:16:31,920 --> 04:16:36,880
He's stinky. Oh, I've already done that. But is this not how I get up to that tingle up there?

3904
04:16:39,760 --> 04:16:41,760
Yes, it is how I get up to that tingle

3905
04:16:46,480 --> 04:16:48,480
Oh my god, that was lucky

3906
04:16:50,800 --> 04:16:52,800
No, no, that's stinky

3907
04:16:53,360 --> 04:16:57,680
Right, if we can get more green we can go back to the original tingle

3908
04:16:57,920 --> 04:17:01,040
And then we've unlocked whatever that is

3909
04:17:01,680 --> 04:17:09,040
Because there's one more. Can I get green please? No, okay. I guess it. Oh, no. Wait, hold on. It's faster just to jump off the map

3910
04:17:10,160 --> 04:17:12,640
Yeah, jump off the site not off the map

3911
04:17:13,520 --> 04:17:16,160
Please don't participate in any dangerous behaviors

3912
04:17:18,480 --> 04:17:24,320
All right, isn't there something up here I need to possibly high probability I think

3913
04:17:25,280 --> 04:17:30,640
Go we and go across the bridge sure say no more fam

04:17:32,720 --> 04:17:39,200
What are is the cross here? There's a hole in the ground. Hello. Okay, where are you here?

3915
04:17:41,520 --> 04:17:44,160
I'm getting a bit Confucius, you know

3916
04:17:45,600 --> 04:17:47,600
Call me a philosopher

3917
04:17:48,480 --> 04:17:58,080
And I assume the whirlwind is just to get over here. Is there anything special over here though?

3918
04:18:00,640 --> 04:18:03,040
Not really. I'm seeing

3919
04:18:04,720 --> 04:18:11,520
No, let's just to get over there. Okay. I think we've done what we can in this immediate vicinity

3920
04:18:13,360 --> 04:18:15,360
Unless

3921
04:18:16,000 --> 04:18:18,000

Oh, I've not unlocked that waterfall

3924
04:18:23,040 --> 04:18:25,040
But there is a chase here

3925
04:18:26,160 --> 04:18:32,480
200 rupees. That's 30 cheeky getch upon for us on a heart. We did it

3926
04:18:33,440 --> 04:18:37,600
How many hearts is that? Oh, sorry. I'm in the war. Oh, why not?

3927
04:18:39,120 --> 04:18:43,280
Oh, I saw it coming. Oh, he can jump in me. He jumped in my money

3928
04:18:45,920 --> 04:18:47,920
He actually gave me more in the end

3929
04:18:49,680 --> 04:18:51,440
Ah

3930
04:18:51,440 --> 04:18:52,560

04:18:52,560 --> 04:18:54,560
Okay, we can now buy 90 getcha

Gorgon

3935
04:19:06,560 --> 04:19:08,560
Are you here?

3936
04:19:08,800 --> 04:19:11,440
Nope. Well, there are chests though, so

3937
04:19:12,560 --> 04:19:14,560
50 perfect

3938
04:19:15,120 --> 04:19:19,760
50 perfect. We actually might need to go to town because we're already at 600 coins again

3939
04:19:21,120 --> 04:19:23,120
All because of our

3940
04:19:24,320 --> 04:19:26,320
Journey

3941
04:19:26,320 --> 04:19:31,760
Yeah, unfortunately didn't unlock the old waterfall here. So that's a definitely come back to moment

3942
04:19:32,480 --> 04:19:35,280
Ow that hurt. Don't do that again

3943
04:19:36,640 --> 04:19:41,120
Um, let's get the Pegasus boots on so we can get that heck out here

3944
04:19:41,120 --> 04:19:47,280
Are we a hundred percent in I am very tempted to 100 percent

3945
04:19:48,800 --> 04:19:51,520
Did I trade with the guy up here?

3946
04:19:53,520 --> 04:19:55,600
Uh, I am very tempted you

3947
04:19:59,520 --> 04:20:02,960
Did we a hundred percent you for you? Oh, I didn't

3948
04:20:03,440 --> 04:20:05,440
You

3949
04:20:07,040 --> 04:20:11,840
That was lucky that was lucky. I was like great another one that I don't have the thing for

3950
04:20:13,280 --> 04:20:15,280
A swamp again

3951
04:20:15,920 --> 04:20:19,280
There is so much happening at the swamp. I'm not even kidding

3952
04:20:20,240 --> 04:20:25,520
So so much. I think we're gonna have to buy green keystone pieces in town as well because this is getting a bit

3953
04:20:26,560 --> 04:20:31,280
It's getting a bit difficult trying to you know, I keep everyone happy

3954
04:20:32,240 --> 04:20:34,240
It's not working

3955
04:20:35,200 --> 04:20:41,280
Uh, because Tingling's asking for stuff I didn't have what is even in me

3956
04:20:41,840 --> 04:20:43,840
What is this?

3957
04:20:43,840 --> 04:20:45,840
We believe in you you can do it. Oh, yeah

3958
04:20:47,280 --> 04:20:48,960

3959
04:20:48,960 --> 04:20:53,360
Oh, how much have we got now? Oh, right. We're get we're gamma time gamma time gamma time

3960
04:20:54,240 --> 04:20:56,240
We can get six more figurines

3961
04:20:56,960 --> 04:21:02,800
Uh, I don't think this is the one that I've been in six more figurines

3962
04:21:05,360 --> 04:21:07,840
And I can see all the red

3963
04:21:09,200 --> 04:21:13,120
Did I hear gamma speak a hundred percent of the game? Are there achievements?

3964
04:21:13,600 --> 04:21:17,760
Are there any achievements for a hundred percent? No, this is like old game

3965
04:21:18,400 --> 04:21:20,880
That doesn't do that kind of stuff for you theories

3966
04:21:22,000 --> 04:21:24,000
Uh, I'll grab one of you. Sorry

3967
04:21:24,880 --> 04:21:30,320
Oh, no, I said I'll grab one of you. Is that a grab? Yes. Thank you. Yeah, we do need a cheeky grab

3968
04:21:31,040 --> 04:21:35,200
My apologies. Uh, I might not be that fun being in a jar, but then again

3969
04:21:40,000 --> 04:21:42,000
That's all I'm gonna say tea

3970
04:21:42,000 --> 04:21:45,920
I've not unlocked those two areas. So there's not even a point in going down

3971
04:21:47,200 --> 04:21:49,200
Ah, I've not unlocked it

3972
04:21:50,400 --> 04:21:51,840
Not unlocked it

3973
04:21:51,840 --> 04:21:57,840
All right, we will now do mount cereal after we hit the tune lads. We're going gambling on the tune

3974
04:21:59,440 --> 04:22:05,840
Or the pockies, uh, if you're not too confused with hit streamer pocky main, and

3975
04:22:07,280 --> 04:22:09,280
Wait, he doesn't restock

3976
04:22:12,560 --> 04:22:15,440
He doesn't restock unless I buy all the kin stones

3977
04:22:16,560 --> 04:22:18,560
I thought he would constantly restock

3978
04:22:19,760 --> 04:22:21,760
Sorry, but I'm here for the gacha

3979
04:22:22,080 --> 04:22:24,080
Give me another hundred of these

3980
04:22:26,960 --> 04:22:33,120
Back when all you got was the self satisfaction of knowing you did it literally

3981
04:22:34,880 --> 04:22:39,040
Just joining what you're gonna do with that fairy in the dark. Look, we were talking about fairies yesterday

3982
04:22:39,440 --> 04:22:41,440
And I was like, I get it. I get it

3983
04:22:41,440 --> 04:22:43,440

pair roll

3992
04:23:27,520 --> 04:23:30,000
Kin stones more like kink stones

Thank you. Thank you. I think I may have fucked up though

3994
04:23:36,800 --> 04:23:38,800
I

3995
04:23:49,840 --> 04:23:51,840
Why does he even want the shells? I don't know

3996
04:23:52,880 --> 04:23:54,880
Some people like collecting things

3997
04:23:54,960 --> 04:24:00,080
They ruined no me. No chinese food. Oh, no, it's a chinese shop

04:24:11,280 --> 04:24:16,480
How's the chinese shop 16 probability if we weren't putting them shells down

4002
04:24:18,720 --> 04:24:20,720
Oh no

4003
04:24:21,280 --> 04:24:24,080
It might be it might be look for bread time

4004
04:24:25,120 --> 04:24:28,400
Hold on a minute instead of that so raven i'm getting a vision that

4005
04:24:29,120 --> 04:24:33,120
Wait a minute guys. I'm getting some bodily function movements internally

4006
04:24:35,680 --> 04:24:40,800
It's not looking good. I can't believe it. I might need a I need a cheeky break. I might need a cheeky break

4007
04:24:40,800 --> 04:24:42,800
I think it might be a loafer clock

4008
04:24:43,920 --> 04:24:45,920
Uh

4009
04:24:50,480 --> 04:24:52,480
What do you mean by that? What do you mean by that?

4010
04:24:53,440 --> 04:24:58,080
See some of each of us do an idol meeting here we drop loaves of bread

4011
04:25:00,800 --> 04:25:06,800
Uh, I don't know how you're uh, you know, there's other euphemisms such as dropping the kids off at the pool

4012
04:25:06,800 --> 04:25:12,800
I have heard that 14 percent. This is this probability is dropping fast

4013
04:25:14,640 --> 04:25:17,280
Yes, I want to trade for a hundred percent guarantee

4014
04:25:17,840 --> 04:25:19,840
Wearing flowers

4015
04:25:20,640 --> 04:25:23,680
This is me wishing my gacha had a function to put more tickets in

4016
04:25:24,640 --> 04:25:26,640
I mean

4017
04:25:26,960 --> 04:25:32,080
Technically, that's why gacha is gacha the more money you put in the more likely you are to like win

4018
04:25:32,160 --> 04:25:34,480
Oh my god, I just want an internal fart if you hear that

4019
04:25:35,360 --> 04:25:40,320
Uh, I think that loafer bread's coming faster than I first anticipated ladies and gentlemen

4020
04:25:41,200 --> 04:25:42,640
Um

4021
04:25:42,640 --> 04:25:44,640
Yes, I will do 88

4022
04:25:45,440 --> 04:25:48,240

4026
04:26:04,160 --> 04:26:09,200
But if you need to uh go and stretch your legs wink wink. Yes stretch your legs. Yes

4027
04:26:09,760 --> 04:26:11,760
Was that yes, yes

4028
04:26:11,920 --> 04:26:16,400
Oh, no, that's not how it works. Just because the Chinese is shot. He doesn't even give me money

4029
04:26:16,640 --> 04:26:21,920
Uh, yeah, but anyway, uh, we're gonna go for a bio hazard break. Do excuse me. Uh, should be a couple of cheeky minutes

4030
04:26:22,000 --> 04:26:25,600
Uh, but I'll make a week up a tea as well. That's probably what's helping it

4031
04:26:25,840 --> 04:26:28,240
Come on is all the sugar and all the honey in the tea

4032
04:26:29,200 --> 04:26:31,200
Okay, I'll be right back

04:36:32,880 --> 04:36:35,280
Doomsday dan I poor sorry

4059
04:36:36,080 --> 04:36:38,880
Calm chaos. I love feature burst running calls

4060
04:36:39,680 --> 04:36:44,960
Why are you giving me money for going for a job? What's going on here? Now hold on a minute. Hold on a minute

4061
04:36:46,000 --> 04:36:50,320
I've made a cup of tea. I was very unsuccessful in my endeavors

4062
04:36:50,640 --> 04:36:57,440
Um, however, I think I've probably done one of the biggest wraps in a very long time

4063
04:36:58,560 --> 04:37:00,560
Um, I've got a cup of tea

4064
04:37:01,520 --> 04:37:04,640
Um, I've had to leave my door open

4065
04:37:05,440 --> 04:37:08,080
Because gimley is now losing her absolute mind

4066
04:37:08,560 --> 04:37:12,320
I don't know if people will come in but if you if you hear paper paper

4067
04:37:12,800 --> 04:37:18,640
If you hear plastic rustling, she's found plastic to chew on which on the rip off of her and spank her out there

4068
04:37:19,520 --> 04:37:20,880
Um

4069
04:37:20,880 --> 04:37:23,840
Okay, one more one more. Yes. Yes. Yes one more probably

4070
04:37:25,520 --> 04:37:28,880
Blue super chats to flush it that that is awful

4071
04:37:29,760 --> 04:37:33,120
Please do not roleplay as my toilet water via your money

4072
04:37:33,360 --> 04:37:36,640
Haha, please do not roleplay like that. Okay

4073
04:37:38,160 --> 04:37:43,120
Um, as long as you're having fun, you can just post the water emoji for free. How about that?

4074
04:37:44,640 --> 04:37:49,520
The braptuber. No, we're we're still peeler at this stage. Honestly

4075
04:37:50,320 --> 04:37:53,840
I might add to it. I'm tempted to add to it. Oh, that's one of the

4076
04:37:54,560 --> 04:38:00,320
Fantasies I should actually mention. What were we doing? I think we're going mount cereal, aren't we?

4077
04:38:00,960 --> 04:38:02,960
Yeah, we are

4078
04:38:03,120 --> 04:38:05,120
Mount cereal

4079
04:38:06,000 --> 04:38:07,120
I

4080
04:38:07,120 --> 04:38:08,480
you

4081
04:38:08,480 --> 04:38:12,400
Oh, hello, link. I uh, yeah, if you have an antibot, I'll just ask anytime. Sure

4082
04:38:13,120 --> 04:38:15,120
Thank you

4083
04:38:16,240 --> 04:38:20,800
As long as it doesn't come beam in your stop, that's literally what it would be called as well

4084
04:38:21,680 --> 04:38:24,480
Right, we're gonna take mount cereal

4085
04:38:25,280 --> 04:38:27,760
cereal. I know it's not cereal, but it's

4086
04:38:31,680 --> 04:38:33,040
Don't jump on me

4087
04:38:33,920 --> 04:38:38,320
Uh, right. I've already done that, so you don't need to worry about that

4088
04:38:43,040 --> 04:38:48,080
If that's the shortcut down, I assume I've already nuked whoever's in here

4089
04:38:49,600 --> 04:38:54,240
Uh, so much fun. Oh wait, I've not been in here. Did I run out? Maybe I didn't have enough bombs at the time

4090
04:38:54,960 --> 04:39:00,720
I'll take the money though. Fine tens. Poor things have been stuck in that cave. First thing I do is take one of their friends and leave

4091
04:39:01,680 --> 04:39:09,280
Uh, I'm just checking if there's anything that looks like I need to bomb at or something

4092
04:39:11,200 --> 04:39:14,880
Hmm, not that my elf I see. Havern

4093
04:39:16,800 --> 04:39:18,800
Daverny Davern

4094
04:39:19,440 --> 04:39:25,200
What about yellow super chat? Oh is that one? I cannot trade. No, sorry. I don't need any bombs

4095
04:39:25,360 --> 04:39:29,120
But thank you for the offer though. I'll get lost. You get lost. You

4096
04:39:29,840 --> 04:39:33,760
Yeah, your business scrub you. Oh, got him

4097
04:39:34,960 --> 04:39:39,760
Right, actually, I may just claim to the it seems like it's going to be like way faster just to claim the hill

4098
04:39:48,000 --> 04:39:53,280
Absolutely ruled that guy by accident. Oh, you can shortcut with the rot. Yeah

4099
04:39:53,600 --> 04:39:55,600
Yeah

4100
04:39:57,120 --> 04:39:59,120
There was a cavern that I couldn't do

4101
04:40:00,480 --> 04:40:05,520
I thought this would work. Or is this just how I'm supposed to actually, no, it must be the other cavern. Sorry

4102
04:40:06,720 --> 04:40:11,920
There was a cavern that we needed to explore with an item that I didn't have yet

4103
04:40:12,800 --> 04:40:17,280
If I need an else this guy, oh our cults groups. Damn, shoot me off. This one

4104
04:40:18,720 --> 04:40:20,720
I'm pretty sure it's a cave

4105
04:40:21,200 --> 04:40:23,200
No

4106
04:40:24,240 --> 04:40:26,240
This cave?

4107
04:40:26,880 --> 04:40:31,040
Short cut to the bomb. So then what's this? Wasn't there no a cave like?

4108
04:40:33,760 --> 04:40:41,280
Is it this? Yes, it was this. Oh one of the four tails apart. Yeah

4109
04:40:42,320 --> 04:40:47,680
Oh sugar. Oh my god. Oh, it's behind the door

4110
04:40:47,920 --> 04:40:49,920
Oh

4111
04:40:51,440 --> 04:40:53,440
And things

4112
04:40:59,840 --> 04:41:02,880
And he's got a special kind stone for us. Let's go

4113
04:41:04,000 --> 04:41:06,000
His name is gray blade

4114
04:41:06,560 --> 04:41:14,320
What does he unlock for us the water falling the swamp? Yeah, we're hitting up the swamp next because we're pretty much done everything in the dang swamp

4115
04:41:15,280 --> 04:41:17,280
Um

4116
04:41:18,880 --> 04:41:21,040
Yeah, you've missed a lot of bomb spots monkeys

4117
04:41:21,920 --> 04:41:25,840
Believe it or not. I'm gray blade and I'm a train. Would you like to train? Yes

4118
04:41:26,960 --> 04:41:31,840
You will learn the roll attack roll and then as soon as you get up scream. Hiya

4119
04:41:33,120 --> 04:41:35,120
Yes, I understand

4120
04:41:36,080 --> 04:41:38,800
But one must feel the technique position

4121
04:41:39,360 --> 04:41:41,360
Oh

4122
04:41:42,960 --> 04:41:46,160
Wow charge attack. Okay. Okay. We'll charge. I like that

4123
04:41:47,040 --> 04:41:50,640
Wait, oh, that's so good. That's a good one. I like that

4124
04:41:52,160 --> 04:41:58,080
We've got the roll attack. Is that all you can teach me master gray blades. I think it is that cat

4125
04:41:59,040 --> 04:42:01,040
Hi, gimli. Do you want to say hi?

4126
04:42:01,360 --> 04:42:05,040
There's nothing left to teach. Okay. Do you want to see do you want to meow?

4127
04:42:05,760 --> 04:42:08,480
Oh, she she doesn't really talk

4128
04:42:09,040 --> 04:42:11,280
Uh, gimli and viva actually don't talk at all

4129
04:42:12,000 --> 04:42:17,440
I know that think about it. You guys like never meow. Um a bit concerning. Should I be worried darlin?

4130
04:42:18,320 --> 04:42:21,520
Do you want to do kinton? No, you don't that's okay. You don't have to

4131
04:42:23,360 --> 04:42:30,960
Uh, whoops, I probably could use that saying but hey ho. Hi gimli. Are you happy to be in the stream?

4132
04:42:31,520 --> 04:42:34,640
Oh, are you all excited to be in the stream?

4133
04:42:35,600 --> 04:42:39,760
You're not supposed to be here. You're not baby girl. We can't help it

4134
04:42:40,880 --> 04:42:45,520
Oh, she she's on the floor doing the little claw thing. Um

4135
04:42:48,800 --> 04:42:53,760
What else is there? I'm sure on the actual mount that we have to claim there is like something on this

4136
04:42:54,640 --> 04:42:56,640
That is my yes

4137
04:42:57,040 --> 04:43:01,040
Pets for gimli. Oh, they're petting you gimli. The reef ones are petting you darlin

4138
04:43:02,720 --> 04:43:07,200
Okay, we need the wall because there was like loads of stuff. I know I probably should do that

4139
04:43:09,600 --> 04:43:15,760
Watch out for falling. Oh, what are you doing? Oh, you climbed my chair. Oh, no, don't play. Don't not with the wires

4140
04:43:16,160 --> 04:43:20,320
This is when this is when I have to take you out the room because you start playing with the wires

4141
04:43:20,320 --> 04:43:22,640
That's not it's not what those are for gimli

4142
04:43:22,640 --> 04:43:24,640
I

4143
04:43:25,840 --> 04:43:32,000
Rollin around on the floor like crazy right now. She's so happy to be in the stream room. You're late in the stream

4144
04:43:33,760 --> 04:43:36,240
Because you might you might do something like

4145
04:43:40,880 --> 04:43:46,080
Is that all we unlock? No, there was a guy up here wasn't there was we need to treat him like that

4146
04:43:46,240 --> 04:43:48,240
Oh

4147
04:43:48,480 --> 04:43:49,840
Wires are so fun though

4148
04:43:49,840 --> 04:43:54,960
Literally emmy and her emmy told me her rats like to chew through everything. I'm like, better not chew through. You're done

4149
04:43:55,040 --> 04:43:57,040

Right, so either sit behind me on the chair or jump that right. Hold on. No, she's done. She's done. Sorry

4152
04:44:09,280 --> 04:44:11,280
She's

4153
04:44:13,360 --> 04:44:15,360
Good girl

4154
04:44:15,360 --> 04:44:18,880
Got him pranked him. She thought I was coming with you

4155
04:44:19,360 --> 04:44:26,240
But pranked her. Yeah, sorry. She she was jumping on the table and I'm like, I can't I can't I can't have you on the table darlin

4156
04:44:26,800 --> 04:44:29,280
Absolutely pranked. So sorry gimli's but

4157
04:44:30,000 --> 04:44:32,000
It is what it is

4158
04:44:32,560 --> 04:44:36,160
We should not banished for bad behavior or anything. She did banish because I can't have her

4159
04:44:36,400 --> 04:44:39,760
Oh, I see it. I see it a heart a heart a heart

4160
04:44:40,640 --> 04:44:45,920
Okay, I'm not going that way. Ha ha. We'll go this way. We'll go this way because I can't deal with other one

4161
04:44:47,520 --> 04:44:51,200
Uh guru guru guru no guru

4162
04:44:55,520 --> 04:44:57,520
Look at this skill

4163
04:44:57,680 --> 04:45:00,720
Look at that skill and bait and can't can't get enough from the piece

4164
04:45:01,360 --> 04:45:04,160
Take a piece of my heart now, baby

4165
04:45:04,160 --> 04:45:06,160
I

4166
04:45:06,960 --> 04:45:08,960
Banished right then

4167
04:45:08,960 --> 04:45:11,920
Did you teach? Oh, no, I don't teach cats that trick cats are

4168
04:45:12,640 --> 04:45:13,840
Uh

4169
04:45:13,840 --> 04:45:15,680
They don't need to be oh

4170
04:45:15,680 --> 04:45:20,560
I cannot believe I didn't know you could wallop those. I thought they were just like a paramount enemy

4171
04:45:21,040 --> 04:45:23,040
That's so silly

4172
04:45:24,720 --> 04:45:29,760
Uh, but no, I never taught my putters any twigs. I don't uh, I don't know they're

4173
04:45:30,320 --> 04:45:32,640
They're cats really performative animals

4174
04:45:34,560 --> 04:45:35,840
Um

4175
04:45:35,840 --> 04:45:39,200
I have had to teach them to let me pick them up. So

4176
04:45:40,160 --> 04:45:41,440
I was

4177
04:45:41,440 --> 04:45:46,720
Had a weird like stance of like, oh, I won't pick up my cat because they don't like it type thing

4178
04:45:47,280 --> 04:45:52,560
But then I realized if there was ever an emergency I need them to be able to leap into my arms

4179
04:45:53,360 --> 04:45:57,120
Um, thankfully no emergency is ever occurred. Well other than

4180
04:45:57,840 --> 04:46:00,720
Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This is exactly what we want

4181
04:46:02,880 --> 04:46:06,000
I'd a cat that leads play bitch. Yeah, teach me to come on. Come on

4182
04:46:07,200 --> 04:46:09,200
You want to teach me to do that?

4183
04:46:11,680 --> 04:46:17,920
There's a solid wall no doubt about it. Is this the last one we've unlocked a chest of some sort

4184
04:46:21,600 --> 04:46:24,160
I got a brother and a sister cat recently and there are

4185
04:46:24,720 --> 04:46:29,920
Uh, they are too keen on getting held. Oh, they aren't no it takes it takes a long time for a cat

4186
04:46:30,160 --> 04:46:36,720
If you think of it imagine something eight times your size picking you up like it's quite it's quite a lot

4187
04:46:37,520 --> 04:46:39,520
But over time over time

4188
04:46:41,280 --> 04:46:43,760
There's normally only one pair of caverns

4189
04:46:47,040 --> 04:46:49,040
Anything else

4190
04:46:49,360 --> 04:46:51,360
Oh

4191
04:46:52,880 --> 04:46:54,880
Yes, but you have to teach us to

4192
04:46:55,280 --> 04:46:57,040
H3o

4193
04:46:57,040 --> 04:46:58,640
H3o

4194
04:46:58,640 --> 04:47:01,840
H, you know H3o is technically right. Hello

4195
04:47:03,120 --> 04:47:05,120
I'm the hermit

4196
04:47:08,400 --> 04:47:12,800
Do you do anything else? No, okay. He just sits here. He's just happy to be here

4197
04:47:13,440 --> 04:47:19,280
Um, I think that's all we can do on the mountain because up ahead is like actual like quest and stuff

4198
04:47:19,840 --> 04:47:21,840
We've already seen the fairy

4199
04:47:24,080 --> 04:47:26,880
So I guess we'll go to the swamp already. Yeah

4200
04:47:31,760 --> 04:47:33,760
All right

4201
04:47:36,960 --> 04:47:39,440
Okay, now that we can swim

4202
04:47:40,400 --> 04:47:42,400
Okay, this is just a snake room

4203
04:47:44,240 --> 04:47:48,720
If only you were eight times my size, I'll wait until you hear about a zoo's lore

4204
04:47:49,520 --> 04:47:51,520
Okay, there's a little thing here

4205
04:47:53,520 --> 04:47:55,520
Back in the tiny

4206
04:47:57,920 --> 04:48:00,800
Oh, this is a vast map though

4207
04:48:01,920 --> 04:48:06,480
Oh a booty fly you call a joy you can now dig faster than before

4208
04:48:06,640 --> 04:48:07,760
Are you squid mirroring?

4209
04:48:07,760 --> 04:48:09,600
Curious

4210
04:48:09,600 --> 04:48:12,640
I am rewatching the member stream of the forbidden tail list

4211
04:48:13,200 --> 04:48:19,920
I didn't realize you had a gen 2 commission waiting. I already tipped on it, but here is some extra chocolate luck

4212
04:48:21,840 --> 04:48:23,840
Wait, what?

4213
04:48:24,880 --> 04:48:32,800
500 am I I need my glasses on unironically where my is that actually say 500 or are you fucking trolling right now?

4214
04:48:32,800 --> 04:48:36,800
Holy shit, what the fuck?

4215
04:48:38,640 --> 04:48:46,000
500 that are for love. Thank you. Hello. What the ink literally what the ink?

4216
04:48:47,520 --> 04:48:49,520
500

4217
04:48:51,440 --> 04:48:53,440
Um, I've kind of

4218
04:48:53,520 --> 04:48:59,200
I've said this before I'm happy to fucking hell 500. Thank you. Jesus

4219
04:48:59,920 --> 04:49:01,440
um

4220
04:49:01,440 --> 04:49:03,440
I have said this before

4221
04:49:03,440 --> 04:49:09,440
But basically we make a route a racially and this is terrible. This is the only way you can describe it

4222
04:49:10,160 --> 04:49:13,040
We make a racially ambiguous person and then

4223
04:49:13,760 --> 04:49:18,000
And then we can chocolate fire them if they're chocolate because you can't have a white chick on a chocolate

4224
04:49:18,720 --> 04:49:20,720
But you can have a chocolate on a white chick

4225
04:49:21,040 --> 04:49:23,040
Example she be chocolate

4226
04:49:23,680 --> 04:49:26,240
But she be she be she be's cooking

4227
04:49:27,280 --> 04:49:28,480
um

4228
04:49:28,480 --> 04:49:31,600
Holy sugar. Ah, that is a lot of money. Thank you

4229
04:49:33,360 --> 04:49:36,080
No, it's true. No, it's true. It's true. It's true

4230
04:49:37,520 --> 04:49:41,680
You can't have a white chick on a chocolate, but you can have a chocolate on a white chick, you know what I mean

4231
04:49:42,880 --> 04:49:45,280
Surely that makes sense. That was a sense, right?

4232
04:49:46,720 --> 04:49:49,280
Uh, right we need to dig under there

4233
04:49:51,440 --> 04:49:54,720
Wait what now? Yeah, no, it does make sense. Yeah. Yeah, okay good

4234
04:49:55,360 --> 04:49:57,680
I might have said it the wrong way by accident, but you know what I mean

4235
04:49:59,440 --> 04:50:01,440
Uh

4236
04:50:01,920 --> 04:50:03,920
Oh

4237
04:50:04,880 --> 04:50:09,280
Right, is there a box 50 I'll take it 50

4238
04:50:11,200 --> 04:50:13,200
We live in a society

4239
04:50:13,920 --> 04:50:15,920
Honestly, I don't mind like I

4240
04:50:16,480 --> 04:50:22,080
remember when the eyes were teased of the models and someone quote tweeted it and they were like

4241
04:50:22,720 --> 04:50:25,040
Oh my god, they're actually coming out with a chocolate

4242
04:50:26,000 --> 04:50:28,160
And like it really made me think like

4243
04:50:29,760 --> 04:50:32,560
Holy shit, y'all motherfuckers don't get any love, do you? Um

4244
04:50:34,160 --> 04:50:40,800
Because everyone's too busy being weird about it. Um, but it just wasn't even a it wasn't even a second thought like

4245
04:50:41,200 --> 04:50:43,200
um, so as I said

4246
04:50:44,080 --> 04:50:46,080
Azura was designed chocolate

4247
04:50:47,040 --> 04:50:52,640
But we then when it came to model production, we made her racially ambiguous

4248
04:50:53,600 --> 04:50:59,680
Because we didn't have a choice. Okay, we didn't have a choice. We had to make her racially ambiguous because we didn't know who was gonna get her but

4249
04:51:02,720 --> 04:51:04,400
Um

4250
04:51:04,400 --> 04:51:08,800
We could make maker chocolate. Um

4251
04:51:10,880 --> 04:51:19,520
Am I being trolled? I'm being trolled. Um, sorry puzzle time. Hold on. Um, and basically like not to give anything away, but um

4252
04:51:20,240 --> 04:51:23,840
You know, then you'd be surprised if another racially ambiguous pops up. Um

4253
04:51:25,040 --> 04:51:26,800
Because just

4254
04:51:26,800 --> 04:51:28,800
Not many designs really

4255
04:51:29,120 --> 04:51:31,120
Wow, what's this?

4256
04:51:31,680 --> 04:51:33,680
A dojo. Hello

4257
04:51:35,120 --> 04:51:38,480
Swordsman ship is spirit. I am the finest or

4258
04:51:39,040 --> 04:51:45,200
Maybe second finest swordman scar blade. Oh because he's got a scar. I like that. Thank you again for that tip

4259
04:51:45,360 --> 04:51:52,320
Fucking 500 that's insane. Please do not tip anymore. That is an insane amount of money. Thank you though. I really appreciate it. Um

4260
04:51:53,840 --> 04:51:55,840
But yes, um

4261
04:51:56,000 --> 04:52:01,600
Basically ambiguous slash chocolate or eating well at veiler. I assure you headquarters are

4262
04:52:02,160 --> 04:52:04,800
Looking after you. What am I doing spin blade?

4263
04:52:05,360 --> 04:52:08,960
You speed up your great spin charge. You won't have to hold the button as long anymore

4264
04:52:10,240 --> 04:52:12,240
Oh, what? That's so fast

4265
04:52:13,200 --> 04:52:14,720
Is she edible?

4266
04:52:14,720 --> 04:52:18,560
We need more chocolate. Well, I thought I thought you weren't so right

4267
04:52:18,960 --> 04:52:23,040
This is just me being dumb like surprise surprise me being dumb named better joe. Um

4268
04:52:24,000 --> 04:52:26,000
But I thought

4269
04:52:26,000 --> 04:52:28,880
That you weren't supposed to say like chocolate and all that

4270
04:52:29,600 --> 04:52:34,640
But then when azura came out and everyone was like chocolate chocolate. I'm like, oh wait, so

4271
04:52:35,360 --> 04:52:37,360
chocolate's fine to say

4272
04:52:37,920 --> 04:52:39,920
Because I didn't know

4273
04:52:39,920 --> 04:52:41,920
But now I'm like, yeah chocolate

4274
04:52:44,080 --> 04:52:46,080
Um

4275
04:52:46,480 --> 04:52:50,480
But yes, right. We've already been there. That's fine. Um

4276
04:52:53,760 --> 04:53:01,120
So, okay, we did unlock a few bits and bobbies here. Okay, we locked like a lot of bits and bobbies

4277
04:53:02,560 --> 04:53:08,640
And some people find out I thought they did too, but then everyone was like, yeah chocolate and I was like, oh, right

4278
04:53:08,640 --> 04:53:12,400
Okay, we're doing this right. Okay. Okay chocolate. Let's go chocolate. Yeah, chocolate feature first

4279
04:53:12,880 --> 04:53:14,880
Let's go like I didn't know

4280
04:53:15,440 --> 04:53:20,000
Um, but like, you know, I'm glad. Uh, yes, you please do not worry about

4281
04:53:20,880 --> 04:53:23,040
a azura being the only

4282
04:53:23,680 --> 04:53:29,440
Rashly ambiguous or chocolate. Um, you eat well at veal or I assure you that much

4283
04:53:30,000 --> 04:53:31,680
um, and

4284
04:53:31,680 --> 04:53:36,240
She be mere may not have something in the work smile smile. She may have something in it

4285
04:53:37,200 --> 04:53:41,360
I just gonna be one of those things where I go po po po po po and it doesn't work

4286
04:53:42,320 --> 04:53:43,440
and

4287
04:53:43,440 --> 04:53:45,440
That's the weirdest shit I've ever heard

4288
04:53:46,320 --> 04:53:48,320
Okay, let's go this way

4289
04:53:48,400 --> 04:53:53,600
I think it has to do with fetishize and finkle a rich normally isn't what they want, but they're not veal or it's a fine

4290
04:53:55,200 --> 04:53:58,000
Yeah, maybe I should ask Azura and she stares

4291
04:53:59,440 --> 04:54:04,560
Um, okay. I've already gotten more for the heck was here. I completely forgot. However, I can swim

4292
04:54:06,960 --> 04:54:08,960
I

4293
04:54:10,640 --> 04:54:15,840
I'm back from being stepped on by she be did you get wrecked under her a mungus?

4294
04:54:18,960 --> 04:54:25,120
Oh, I haven't been here. Okay. Okay. I'll take it red piece again. Okay. I'm taking a sipping tin of my tea

4295
04:54:27,840 --> 04:54:31,680
I can't believe it. I can't believe people know realize that I am h word for

4296
04:54:32,640 --> 04:54:34,640
a

4297
04:54:35,200 --> 04:54:37,040
Cheeky bit of choco

4298
04:54:37,040 --> 04:54:42,640
That's terrible. Please don't actually take anything. I say seriously. I am brain rot is from the core

4299
04:54:44,160 --> 04:54:50,320
Um, there was a water thing over here. I'm like 99 percent sure

4300
04:54:56,560 --> 04:55:00,720
Yes, there was I don't remember going in it if we have been here this

4301
04:55:01,680 --> 04:55:03,680
I

4302
04:55:03,920 --> 04:55:05,920
Have we been here?

4303
04:55:11,360 --> 04:55:13,040
Oh

4304
04:55:13,040 --> 04:55:16,800
Fucking hole in one don't mind me. I was uh one in five

4305
04:55:17,920 --> 04:55:19,920
It's kind of like saying

4306
04:55:20,160 --> 04:55:23,760
Need someone to be positive. Oh, she's almost died there because I was reading

4307
04:55:24,400 --> 04:55:29,920
It's kind of like how saying something needs to be positive and not directly. We love the hmm

4308
04:55:30,160 --> 04:55:32,160
I love that terminology

4309
04:55:34,400 --> 04:55:36,400
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

4310
04:55:36,640 --> 04:55:40,320
Uh, I do not want to lose health because that laser thing is

4311
04:55:42,080 --> 04:55:45,280
Oh, that's cheating. That's right. That's how you get nuked into the strat sphere

4312
04:55:48,640 --> 04:55:50,640
Oh wait, can I just deflect?

4313
04:55:51,520 --> 04:55:54,960
Oh, I can just deflect. Are you joking me? These guys are so easy

4314
04:55:55,920 --> 04:56:00,960
I can deflect of course I can deflect. Why wouldn't I be able to deflect?

4315
04:56:01,680 --> 04:56:04,720
You totally neglect this area clearly don't at least you have

4316
04:56:05,520 --> 04:56:10,880
At least you have been to ask this stuff and tell people I hope yeah, like I thought it was bad, but then like

4317
04:56:12,240 --> 04:56:14,560
I am like chocolate was like celebrating

4318
04:56:15,600 --> 04:56:17,600
Azura and I'm like wait, so

4319
04:56:17,680 --> 04:56:19,680
It's a term fan

4320
04:56:20,320 --> 04:56:22,320
Wait

4321
04:56:25,200 --> 04:56:29,440
Now you all calm down in here you all calm down calm calm

4322
04:56:30,640 --> 04:56:32,640
All right, give me the goods

4323
04:56:34,160 --> 04:56:36,160
Sorry

4324
04:56:36,320 --> 04:56:41,440
Yeah, whoever said that sneezes are like one-fifth of a honestly agreed. It feels really nice

4325
04:56:42,960 --> 04:56:44,960
Oh, I got a new one. Did I get a new one?

4326
04:56:46,400 --> 04:56:50,240
I think I've got a new one. Sorry. I'm too busy. Bless you. Thank you

4327
04:56:51,200 --> 04:56:53,440
It gives on high. Thank you. Well

4328
04:56:56,160 --> 04:56:58,160
Random German noises, okay

4329
04:56:58,640 --> 04:57:01,040
Did I walk past this? I must go

4330
04:57:02,000 --> 04:57:05,680
Okay, now I can't do anything else being weak. So we're gonna go back to being big

4331
04:57:07,600 --> 04:57:09,600
Unless I can go over this

4332
04:57:10,880 --> 04:57:14,000
Sure, what's over here? Let me know

4333
04:57:16,160 --> 04:57:19,200
Uh can't go in there. Yeah, um

4334
04:57:21,040 --> 04:57:23,440
Right, okay, we've done all we can being we

4335
04:57:36,800 --> 04:57:41,280
How do I get big again? Jeez, this is quite a trick and I have to get big

4336
04:57:44,000 --> 04:57:47,920
Oh boy, I better make plans for this after steam. It shouldn't be oh

4337
04:57:48,880 --> 04:57:50,880
It'd be very refling that

4338
04:57:51,520 --> 04:57:53,520
About to get showered in quality

4339
04:57:53,680 --> 04:57:57,760
Um, I honestly thought it's gonna be a four hour stream. We've hit the five hour mark

4340
04:57:57,760 --> 04:58:01,200
And we're like no the end is not in sight. I repeat the end is not in

4341
04:58:03,440 --> 04:58:05,440
Oh, I'm actually gonna have to

4342
04:58:06,240 --> 04:58:08,240
Do that fly thing

4343
04:58:09,120 --> 04:58:11,120
No, I can just run across the

4344
04:58:13,600 --> 04:58:17,360
Mate, I'm getting so turned around right now. I'm getting so turned around

4345
04:58:18,800 --> 04:58:20,800
Where the heck am I?

4346
04:58:21,920 --> 04:58:23,920
I need something to claim

4347
04:58:26,400 --> 04:58:28,400
We might have a three parer I'm

4348
04:58:32,000 --> 04:58:34,000
Moving

4349
04:58:36,320 --> 04:58:40,240
That's so terrible that oh see that went a little better

4350
04:58:44,880 --> 04:58:46,880
Wait, I've not done that one

4351
04:58:48,720 --> 04:58:51,440
Oh, I think I need a poke it in its eye

4352
04:59:02,240 --> 04:59:05,280
I wish they would perish permanently my only

4353
04:59:06,160 --> 04:59:12,320
My only gripe with this game is just oh and I've gone away. I don't even need to go

4354
04:59:13,040 --> 04:59:15,040
What happens if I jump down here? What happens? Hmm?

4355
04:59:15,440 --> 04:59:17,440
They're far

4356
04:59:17,920 --> 04:59:20,800
You will you teach me now master ugwe?

4357
04:59:22,720 --> 04:59:27,280
Though my body may perish swiftly the first you were trained with me. So would you like to train? Yes

4358
04:59:28,480 --> 04:59:34,320
This is the technique that I only have mastered only one who holds the sacred blade can perform the great spin attack first

4359
04:59:34,320 --> 04:59:38,160
Do a spin attack press the button repeatedly. Yes, I understand

4360
04:59:39,120 --> 04:59:41,920
Okay, let's go position

4361
04:59:42,880 --> 04:59:48,640
It's a day ending in why so strong any forces are we flings for another 12 hour endurance stream no sleep blood

4362
04:59:49,520 --> 04:59:54,880
I like the stories where they're like, oh I fell asleep at the start of your stream and then I got to wake up to you

4363
04:59:55,120 --> 04:59:57,120
And I'm like, oh

4364
04:59:57,280 --> 04:59:59,680
Okay, I like hurricane spin. That's so good

4365
05:00:00,880 --> 05:00:03,280
My wings are like a hurricane

4366
05:00:04,000 --> 05:00:08,880
That's a that's a hobbit with wings the smoke. No, there's nothing more. I can teach you you're on your own

4367
05:00:10,640 --> 05:00:12,640
So if I'll learn everything

4368
05:00:14,880 --> 05:00:20,240
Wait, wait a minute. Oh, no, I have to be small

4369
05:00:21,680 --> 05:00:23,680
No, I have to go back

4370
05:00:26,400 --> 05:00:30,080
I had I had to go in the sweet lily pad here to go here

4371
05:00:30,400 --> 05:00:33,680
Say it so

4372
05:00:34,880 --> 05:00:36,880
I will not oh butterfly

4373
05:00:36,960 --> 05:00:42,720
You can cause you caught a joy butterfly. You can now shoot arrows faster than before. Oh, I like that

4374
05:00:45,280 --> 05:00:49,760
There was something I was supposed to do back here and I didn't do it out of pure laziness. I'm sorry

4375
05:00:54,560 --> 05:00:56,560
Oh, I need to finish my teeth. I almost forget

4376
05:00:56,640 --> 05:01:05,040
You guys are just so interesting that you're like, I don't think I've ever had like a nice pipe and perfectly temperature tea

4377
05:01:08,160 --> 05:01:11,280
I actually woke up from a nap earlier go waking up to use one of the pillagers

4378
05:01:11,360 --> 05:01:16,800
I think yeah, someone sent me a marshmallow and they're like, it's actually really nice that no matter what time of day

4379
05:01:17,280 --> 05:01:21,040
I get the opportunity to catch you live and I'm like, damn

4380
05:01:21,680 --> 05:01:23,680
like that sounds like

4381
05:01:24,000 --> 05:01:25,440
I'm like

4382
05:01:25,440 --> 05:01:27,440
Addicted and like online all the time

4383
05:01:27,680 --> 05:01:32,800
Also, me who is like, yeah, if you two didn't have vodishes, I'd probably pull you for like 14 hours

4384
05:01:32,960 --> 05:01:34,960
Yeah, like stream for 14 hours. Yeah

4385
05:01:36,160 --> 05:01:38,160
Maybe I do have a problem

4386
05:01:38,720 --> 05:01:40,720
But it's a problem

4387
05:01:40,880 --> 05:01:43,120
If it has if it's good, you know

4388
05:01:43,360 --> 05:01:45,360
Yeah

4389
05:01:49,040 --> 05:01:50,880
Yes, having a good day. Oh, I'm having a good day

4390
05:01:50,880 --> 05:01:56,560
We're currently mucking about going back to see if we can pick up more hearts before we do this boss fight

4391
05:01:56,960 --> 05:02:03,280
We are now missing 16 pieces, which is actually still quite a decent amount in all honesty

4392
05:02:04,320 --> 05:02:06,000
um

4393
05:02:06,000 --> 05:02:12,160
Unfortunately, I'm not aware where I missed. I need to trade quite a few Kinstone like there's a few waterfalls and stuff to the

4394
05:02:12,800 --> 05:02:15,200
Right side of the map that I haven't unlocked. So

4395
05:02:18,480 --> 05:02:24,160
You start when I finish working most of the time I just get to watch almost all of the streams that's good timing

4396
05:02:25,760 --> 05:02:29,840
Shawnee's the best problem to have it's not a problem if we're all enjoying it

4397
05:02:31,120 --> 05:02:34,560
If it's ever a problem and you need to you need to make your

4398
05:02:35,760 --> 05:02:40,160
Your issues heard just go on my alt twitter and see if it's a problem after listening

4399
05:02:43,040 --> 05:02:47,200
Oh, I just realized link blinks even though you're afk

4400
05:02:51,840 --> 05:02:55,440
Okay, finish the tea. Let's see what I am missing

4401
05:02:58,640 --> 05:03:00,640
We don't need to deal with that

4402
05:03:01,600 --> 05:03:03,920
Is there anything hidden back there? Not that I can tell

4403
05:03:05,120 --> 05:03:08,640
Okay, there's quite a few bits and bulbs here. Ow. Don't do that again

4404
05:03:09,520 --> 05:03:11,520
Okay, there we go

4405
05:03:13,040 --> 05:03:15,040
200 that's fantastic

4406
05:03:17,120 --> 05:03:22,560
Oh get your pawn work. Oh, no, we don't have access. This is definitely a Kinstone

4407
05:03:25,280 --> 05:03:27,600
Oh, and there's a beanstalk as well

4408
05:03:29,280 --> 05:03:32,080
Oh, sorry, I didn't know I thought he was perished but he's not

4409
05:03:35,680 --> 05:03:37,680
No, come on

4410
05:03:39,600 --> 05:03:41,600
There we go

4411
05:03:42,880 --> 05:03:47,840
Uh, wait, don't you be small over here? Oh, wow, I do need to be small from over here

4412
05:03:48,400 --> 05:03:50,400
Okay, let's take a little meter

4413
05:03:50,560 --> 05:03:54,160
You start streaming just around the time I'm able to get to my pc after work

4414
05:03:54,480 --> 05:03:59,840
It's like seven company will I get to raw at my desk bro raw after work all you need to

4415
05:04:00,240 --> 05:04:06,000
I used to be physically mentally drained after my wee shifts at the cafe

4416
05:04:06,960 --> 05:04:11,440
Although working on the care homes actually probably rougher on the mental and

4417
05:04:12,240 --> 05:04:15,840
But my favorite thing about being a waitress was like you'd be like

4418
05:04:16,640 --> 05:04:22,960
I forgot the water for table seven when you're like going to bed and trying to sleep. You're like, oh, no

4419
05:04:24,560 --> 05:04:29,360
Um, I always like laugh at those memories. You got a piece of heart make four

4420
05:04:29,920 --> 05:04:31,920
Oh

4421
05:04:32,400 --> 05:04:36,160
I still actually I still remember I served this couple

4422
05:04:37,360 --> 05:04:38,800
um

4423
05:04:38,800 --> 05:04:40,480
and there was a few

4424
05:04:40,480 --> 05:04:45,360
Waitress and waitresses waitress I I don't know. There was a few of us on the floor

4425
05:04:46,080 --> 05:04:50,960
But all of us unanimously assumed each other had gotten to that table

4426
05:04:52,000 --> 05:04:54,880
And they were sitting waiting for 20 minutes on nothing and I was

4427
05:04:55,200 --> 05:05:01,840
More like I felt so bad. I'm like felt so freaking bad. Honestly. Wait. I just under your turn. Um

4428
05:05:03,040 --> 05:05:05,520
And I still think about that couple to this day

4429
05:05:06,160 --> 05:05:08,000
I feel so sorry

4430
05:05:08,000 --> 05:05:13,440
But basically they all made me go because I was the youngest and they were like, well, they're not going to be pissy

4431
05:05:13,520 --> 05:05:19,840
Yeah, like a young waitress type thing. So I had to go but they were actually still like super nice. Um, and

4432
05:05:20,160 --> 05:05:21,280
Um

4433
05:05:21,280 --> 05:05:28,880
Because the owner worked with us like I explained the situation and we didn't charge them for drinks type thing

4434
05:05:29,040 --> 05:05:35,520
Like I think it's called cop pain or something like when you don't get the person to

4435
05:05:36,720 --> 05:05:38,720
um

4436
05:05:39,200 --> 05:05:41,200
Right, we need to switch off this guy

4437
05:05:43,120 --> 05:05:45,600
Because he'll run ahead which you really shouldn't do

4438
05:05:46,320 --> 05:05:48,320
um

4439
05:05:48,560 --> 05:05:54,480
I bet you made bank getting all the tips because you're so charming. Well, funny you mentioned that I had, um

4440
05:05:56,480 --> 05:06:02,960
A co-worker who used to send me to get payments from folk because I was like a

4441
05:06:03,680 --> 05:06:05,680
A peer very young and I look very young

4442
05:06:06,240 --> 05:06:07,520
um

4443
05:06:07,520 --> 05:06:12,240
And he was like, oh, they never tip me because I'm a guy but you're a chick

4444
05:06:12,800 --> 05:06:16,720
So they'll tip you they'll tip you so you go out and get them to pay like say oh

4445
05:06:16,720 --> 05:06:18,720
It's your turn to pay and all that

4446
05:06:18,800 --> 05:06:20,800
and

4447
05:06:20,960 --> 05:06:22,480
And I

4448
05:06:22,480 --> 05:06:26,480
It actually did work. Like I think we tried it and it definitely worked

4449
05:06:28,480 --> 05:06:30,480
And

4450
05:06:30,480 --> 05:06:32,160
you know

4451
05:06:32,160 --> 05:06:35,040
Strongly useful. Yes, I have a face of bobby

4452
05:06:35,840 --> 05:06:37,200
Oh

4453
05:06:37,200 --> 05:06:40,880
Because it's cutting the grass. Oh, there's a bill. All right. Okay. It's fine

4454
05:06:42,320 --> 05:06:43,920
Harris

4455
05:06:43,920 --> 05:06:45,920
I think there's an enemy in one of these

4456
05:06:47,680 --> 05:06:50,160
Shawnee didn't hit no from the start

4457
05:06:52,240 --> 05:06:54,240
Not quite

4458
05:06:54,320 --> 05:06:59,680
Of course it works. They proved it in mythbusters. Wait, they didn't mythbusters that you get more tips if you're a chick

4459
05:07:00,160 --> 05:07:02,880
I believe it. Oh bomba. How much bomba?

4460
05:07:03,520 --> 05:07:05,520
What 100 bomba?

4461
05:07:06,880 --> 05:07:08,880
That's actually pretty

4462
05:07:09,440 --> 05:07:11,200
too much

4463
05:07:11,200 --> 05:07:13,520
I just realized I haven't been checking the maps

4464
05:07:14,480 --> 05:07:16,480
There's treasure in the left

4465
05:07:17,600 --> 05:07:19,600
In the left

4466
05:07:20,320 --> 05:07:26,160
There's treasure that I've not picked up. Okay. I'm actually kind of glad I've actually not gone back into the other temples

4467
05:07:26,960 --> 05:07:32,480
Oh, there's treasure in here. What's the treasure? It's a freaking trap shadow wizard money gang

4468
05:07:33,200 --> 05:07:35,200
We love kissing spells

4469
05:07:37,760 --> 05:07:39,520
They got me

4470
05:07:39,520 --> 05:07:41,520
Yay, we got you shells

4471
05:07:42,160 --> 05:07:46,560
Okay. Well, that was actually kind of lucky because that I didn't wait. Is there like a thing here?

4472
05:07:47,840 --> 05:07:49,840
Oh, there is

4473
05:07:53,040 --> 05:07:55,040
Shawnee's passive, let me take your money

4474
05:07:56,160 --> 05:07:58,160
If you're cute and nice

4475
05:07:58,640 --> 05:08:03,120
Yeah, like I used to read the reviews and I always got mentioned in the reviews like ah, sorry

4476
05:08:03,120 --> 05:08:05,760
I took so much pride in my movie waitress job

4477
05:08:05,840 --> 05:08:07,840
Like I know some people might like well

4478
05:08:08,160 --> 05:08:10,800
You guys wouldn't because you guys are reeflands and you guys get up

4479
05:08:10,880 --> 05:08:16,880
But like some people then like oh it used to be a waitress like all you did was serve and like used to clean toilets at the end of the day

4480
05:08:16,880 --> 05:08:21,440
And I'm like, yeah, I used to take pride in my work. I love my job. It was so fun and

4481
05:08:22,240 --> 05:08:24,560
everything was like such a nice experience and

4482
05:08:25,440 --> 05:08:29,360
Yeah, and I got to talk to people from all around the world because um

4483
05:08:30,160 --> 05:08:32,560
it was like a tourism cafe and

4484
05:08:33,120 --> 05:08:38,000
Like fuck yeah, I enjoyed my job like let's fuck up. Never anyone

4485
05:08:39,440 --> 05:08:43,360
You know, some people are like embarrassed about their tail. I'm like no, I haven't made some time like it's a fuck size

4486
05:08:43,360 --> 05:08:45,360
But like it's so fun

4487
05:08:45,920 --> 05:08:49,040
No one should be ashamed of their job not then maybe like literally

4488
05:08:50,560 --> 05:08:52,160
like

4489
05:08:52,160 --> 05:08:56,160
I've never been thinking about it was like because I think if you ever like if

4490
05:08:56,240 --> 05:09:00,560
If you talk to someone who's like never had a job before and they're like, oh you used to have to clean toilets

4491
05:09:01,120 --> 05:09:03,120
Yeah, it's just part of the job like

4492
05:09:03,280 --> 05:09:06,400
Someone's taking a fat job a although I will say one thing

4493
05:09:06,400 --> 05:09:11,760
I had a really good boss if someone's fucking bombed the toilet. No, I didn't have to clean it

4494
05:09:12,320 --> 05:09:18,000
Because my boss was so good like if it was like absolutely fucking nasty as fuck my boss would do it

4495
05:09:21,840 --> 05:09:23,840
I don't trust this room

4496
05:09:24,240 --> 05:09:26,240
Oh, well, there you go

4497
05:09:26,640 --> 05:09:28,640
No, my boss was amazing

4498
05:09:29,600 --> 05:09:31,600
It was literally a

4499
05:09:33,120 --> 05:09:38,240
Change my life unironically. I know it sounds silly, but saying like oh that job changed my life

4500
05:09:38,480 --> 05:09:41,680
But I like it actually unironically that they'll change like trajectory

4501
05:09:43,440 --> 05:09:48,000
Um, because I was like very unconfident. I was like so unsure of myself. So

4502
05:09:48,880 --> 05:09:51,440
How did I miss this? This is out in the open

4503
05:09:52,720 --> 05:09:55,120
Right, let's go south see what happens

4504
05:09:56,560 --> 05:09:57,600
Ow

4505
05:09:57,600 --> 05:10:02,240
How did I bump off the edge of the map? Right, I'm pretty sure we're supposed to dig here

4506
05:10:04,560 --> 05:10:07,920
Oh in the money

4507
05:10:10,880 --> 05:10:17,120
Hello, we get to buy another couple of shells with that 800 coins for that

4508
05:10:18,960 --> 05:10:23,840
But here uh fairies jump out of those things as well here

4509
05:10:24,000 --> 05:10:28,160
Sorry, please don't shoot me. I'm just a little guy

4510
05:10:30,960 --> 05:10:38,560
Because you ignored everything basically they got kinstones open. How dare you how dare you accuse me of my terrible gameplay

4511
05:10:39,600 --> 05:10:42,160
Even though I've shown it here in 4k

4512
05:10:43,680 --> 05:10:48,880
Literally dropping the album having a good boss makes everything so much easier. Oh, tell me about it

4513
05:10:50,640 --> 05:10:52,640
Like at the care home

4514
05:10:53,600 --> 05:10:58,000
Look, I'm just saying if you ever want to do the care home

4515
05:11:00,880 --> 05:11:02,880
I'm pretty sure they committed like

4516
05:11:03,040 --> 05:11:05,040
paycheck fraud with me

4517
05:11:05,120 --> 05:11:08,800
and because when I like wrapped up my employment

4518
05:11:09,600 --> 05:11:11,600
um, I got like extra

4519
05:11:11,840 --> 05:11:17,520
500 great British pounds and I had to phone them up and be like you've overpaid me like you've paid me my

4520
05:11:17,760 --> 05:11:23,680
Like my wages when I've not worked with you and they were like no no just take it and I'm like

4521
05:11:25,600 --> 05:11:31,120
What do you mean just take it like a phone during everything no no just take it just

4522
05:11:40,000 --> 05:11:46,800
So basically when I departed from the care home, I got like extra 500 quid from day nothing

4523
05:11:48,320 --> 05:11:53,760
We are going to go spend all this money because this is it. Do you mind you're literally in my way in my way

4524
05:11:54,800 --> 05:11:57,360
Okay, you can't actually run off into the next segment

4525
05:11:58,480 --> 05:12:00,640
A little saucy. Oh, it was saucy. All right

4526
05:12:01,200 --> 05:12:02,640
and

4527
05:12:02,640 --> 05:12:06,640
I'm not going to complain an extra 500 quid in my pocket. They made me I was off on one

4528
05:12:08,000 --> 05:12:10,000
and

4529
05:12:10,000 --> 05:12:12,080
Put it in my wee bank account. Right. We're gonna buy

4530
05:12:12,480 --> 05:12:17,680
Out what shells we can because we have far too much money and nothing to spend on

4531
05:12:20,640 --> 05:12:25,040
Yeah, care homes are an absolute mess like they constantly change hands of management

4532
05:12:25,040 --> 05:12:27,360
They constantly change companies and all of that

4533
05:12:28,160 --> 05:12:32,880
They're constantly understaffed a stupid diss amount of understaffing

4534
05:12:33,840 --> 05:12:38,160
Um, and they do it on purpose to maximize like earnings and all of that

4535
05:12:38,720 --> 05:12:42,800
And it's like, you know who suffers the actual folk in the care home suffer because

4536
05:12:43,280 --> 05:12:48,400
It's just chaos like from and the shifts are 12 hour. Oh, forgive me keep them this

4537
05:12:48,880 --> 05:12:52,160
The shifts are 12 hours as well like sorry

4538
05:12:52,720 --> 05:12:59,840
But the human body is tired after six hours and you're asking like four people to look after like

4539
05:13:00,400 --> 05:13:06,320
How much elderly like 60 elderly on a ward type thing? Oh, it's absolutely crazy

4540
05:13:07,280 --> 05:13:13,440
Oh, it's like that all over the world. So it's no it definitely is all over like it's pretty outrageous. How many

4541
05:13:13,840 --> 05:13:15,840
Okay, we're gonna do five gamble

4542
05:13:17,040 --> 05:13:20,880
We must be getting close to being done unless I'm like completely just

4543
05:13:22,480 --> 05:13:24,480
blown smoke

4544
05:13:27,360 --> 05:13:29,360
It

4545
05:13:29,360 --> 05:13:31,360
Okay

4546
05:13:31,680 --> 05:13:38,800
Yeah, let's get that probability up because that is uh, there's not even a point in doing the 1% probability

4547
05:13:42,000 --> 05:13:47,360
Wait, is it gonna am I not gonna be able to achieve 100% if I put 99 in

4548
05:13:50,240 --> 05:13:52,240
Big green to chew

4549
05:13:52,880 --> 05:13:55,360
By all the monster adventure manuals

4550
05:13:55,600 --> 05:14:00,880
Is that what the post office thing was when she was charging me 200 quid for and I was like not on your bike in

4551
05:14:02,160 --> 05:14:06,080
Link between worlds lets you peg his his dash between screens if you play. Yeah

4552
05:14:07,200 --> 05:14:09,200
maybe

4553
05:14:09,280 --> 05:14:13,680
I need to look at that freaking new game that came out with the trailer

4554
05:14:14,960 --> 05:14:20,800
As I said, I'd put it on but probably get copyright. I door mimic appears in the royal crypt

4555
05:14:20,880 --> 05:14:26,480
They look like doors, but they're really traps if you get too close to make fall down. What a very unique thing

4556
05:14:28,720 --> 05:14:30,720
Indeed

4557
05:14:32,480 --> 05:14:38,080
Yeah, she is trying to sell you manuals which are the same price as the shells of 200 mimic hate

4558
05:14:40,320 --> 05:14:42,320
Honestly 91

4559
05:14:44,400 --> 05:14:47,360
Give me the goddamn getcha. Give me that thing right now

4560
05:14:48,320 --> 05:14:50,320
I went in that shop

4561
05:14:50,880 --> 05:14:54,880
Demi ma a pi ha appears on mount a cranel

4562
05:14:55,680 --> 05:15:00,640
The strange beast hover on preparer like leaves you can pull them out of the sky with a gustar

4563
05:15:02,880 --> 05:15:06,160
Does it get one more shell expensive retain?

4564
05:15:07,360 --> 05:15:09,920
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about because

4565
05:15:11,600 --> 05:15:16,560
It's literally nine percent probability one every nine getcha pulls. Yeah, I'm not doing that

4566
05:15:17,040 --> 05:15:19,040
We'd be here for a millennial

4567
05:15:21,280 --> 05:15:24,880
A hundred you're going to treat 92. Yes, I am

4568

05:15:51,120 --> 05:15:53,680
93 yeah, this is gonna get rough

4572
05:15:58,160 --> 05:16:00,320
I'm going to know what this man's doing all these shells

4573
05:16:01,120 --> 05:16:05,600
Making acroband is although they actually be really cool and acrobat

4574
05:16:06,400 --> 05:16:08,400
Oh, how would you put that in a model though?

4575
05:16:09,200 --> 05:16:14,160
I always say I'm like, oh, that's such a good idea for a feature bar and then I'm like, how would you even execute that plan?

4576
05:16:14,320 --> 05:16:20,160
It doesn't hurt and I forgot to get my blanket for my poor legs. I'm cutting this uh bucket

4577
05:16:21,680 --> 05:16:26,240
78 8 of a new one one in four roughly

4578
05:16:27,040 --> 05:16:29,040
It's sorry three in four roughly

4579
05:16:31,280 --> 05:16:33,760
A rupee like appears in caverns dungeons

4580
05:16:33,760 --> 05:16:40,160
This rupee like has a rupee dangling from its headstock the clever lure attracts greedy and delicious heroes

4581
05:16:40,880 --> 05:16:42,640
They jump in me

4582
05:16:42,640 --> 05:16:45,120
Right, let's see what is going on here

4583
05:16:46,240 --> 05:16:48,240
One two three

4584
05:16:49,920 --> 05:16:51,920
Four

4585
05:16:55,120 --> 05:16:57,120
Four five

4586
05:17:00,640 --> 05:17:02,640
Six

4587
05:17:03,200 --> 05:17:05,200
Seven eight nine ten ten

4588
05:17:07,680 --> 05:17:09,680
No way we're actually going to do it

4589
05:17:10,640 --> 05:17:16,800
I thought it was impossible, but we're gonna do it. Uh, what do I need to adventure next?

4590
05:17:19,600 --> 05:17:21,600
Top

4591
05:17:22,640 --> 05:17:25,920
Did I go in the waterfall? I can't remember

4592
05:17:29,520 --> 05:17:32,800
I think it's the I love monster goes major but many of the best

4593
05:17:33,520 --> 05:17:39,200
Once has a bottom half a side in tragic. There's a lot of stuff where it was like in theory good

4594
05:17:39,840 --> 05:17:41,040
actually

4595
05:17:41,040 --> 05:17:43,040
You know executing it

4596
05:17:45,120 --> 05:17:51,920
Uh, sorry, I'm a bit flabbergasted on where to go. Maybe bottom and try bottom

4597
05:17:52,560 --> 05:17:56,720
Western world. Why not? I'm not really explored that. Have we have any question mark?

4598
05:17:58,080 --> 05:18:00,800

4599
05:18:01,120 --> 05:18:03,120

Oh, you're not getting me. You're not getting me. Okay. You're all getting me. You're all getting me. They're jumping me

4605
05:18:36,880 --> 05:18:38,880
So this was what?

05:18:39,760 --> 05:18:45,840
Ah, okay. This is where I want to be. Yes. Okay. We're cutting the grass. Sorry. We're going on a grass cutting mission

4607
05:18:47,040 --> 05:18:52,720
It's really important to high rule that we cut the grass. Okay. It's very important. I assure you

4608
05:18:53,040 --> 05:18:55,440
It's not a waste of time whatsoever

Do you want to go back to your house? Oh, perfect. Okay

4615
05:19:28,880 --> 05:19:34,320
So do you not stay in here anymore? No, he's got right. He's gone back to his house. So hopefully he gives us something for that

4616
05:19:34,960 --> 05:19:41,280
I'm cutting the grass cutty cutty grass. I'm cutting the grass. Well, I'll take the end

4617
05:19:44,000 --> 05:19:48,640
What's down here then money again, I'm not gonna say no. I'm not gonna say no

4618

We've got we've got things to buy. We're gonna have to buy that newsletter from that lady

4619
05:19:52,880 --> 05:19:56,080
What was this did I come this way? No, I have already been here. Um

4620
05:19:57,120 --> 05:20:00,880
We cut the grass cut the grass and really fast

4621
05:20:03,920 --> 05:20:07,440
I don't know if this is actually faster, you know that I'm just getting hurt now, right?

4622
05:20:07,440 --> 05:20:09,440
I should maybe pay attention a bit my bad

4623
05:20:10,320 --> 05:20:12,480
I'm getting over zealots

4624
05:20:13,280 --> 05:20:15,280
Is that a word?

4625
05:20:15,760 --> 05:20:17,760
She asked nicely

4626
05:20:18,160 --> 05:20:20,160
Is there anything here?

4627
05:20:22,080 --> 05:20:24,080
No, I think there

4628
05:20:26,080 --> 05:20:28,080
Wait, so I can go downwards

4629
05:20:30,960 --> 05:20:36,080
Let's go and meet him in his house and maybe we can unlock something for doing it. Hi

4630
05:20:36,800 --> 05:20:38,800
Oh, no, what's wrong?

4631
05:20:39,040 --> 05:20:44,800
Oh dear Link won't you listen to my verse when I finally returned to my home sweet home a stranger was there

4632
05:20:44,800 --> 05:20:48,080
I'm an extremely shy person. I just can't talk to someone. I don't know

4633
05:20:48,400 --> 05:20:50,400
Sad to put my feelings on a verse

4634
05:20:50,400 --> 05:20:55,440
Well, I was gone. Did you break in to practice your thieving art even if you robbed my home?

4635
05:20:55,520 --> 05:20:57,520
You can never steal my heart

4636
05:20:59,840 --> 05:21:07,280
Uh a dark room settles my soul. I say do not turn the lights on I say. Mmm. It's giving demonic possession

4643
05:21:26,720 --> 05:21:31,360

4644
05:21:31,920 --> 05:21:33,120
to

4645
05:21:33,120 --> 05:21:39,840
The way made safe I come back home to find me inside all alone in my chest my poor heart aches

4646
05:21:39,840 --> 05:21:43,280
But for you I feel the deepest thing wait. Did that ring or did I say that wrong?

4647
05:21:43,680 --> 05:21:49,200
My dresser is entirely stuffed with these icky blue shells. Would you clean them out for me?

4648
05:21:50,080 --> 05:21:56,080
Yes, I'll clean them out. Yes, I will clean them out. Thank you so much. I appreciate it going with cute little heads

05:22:08,400 --> 05:22:10,400
Because

4652
05:22:11,120 --> 05:22:17,360
Um, I think we can now give over our magical green liquid. She'd let me give over the green liquid

4653
05:22:28,320 --> 05:22:33,840
What a peaceful little game honestly I say that is if when we do the boss fight, I'm not going to be screaming

4654
05:22:34,560 --> 05:22:38,240
Uh, just as a warning, uh, I'm not very strong at the boss fight. I

4655
05:22:42,560 --> 05:22:46,400
Five minutes are over for sure for sure. She remembers. I know

4656
05:22:58,320 --> 05:23:00,320
I don't remember having

4657
05:23:01,120 --> 05:23:03,120
Oh

4658
05:23:03,280 --> 05:23:05,280
That was so pretty

No, I gotta wait. I gotta be patient. Oh, fine. I'll go. We do question

4664
05:23:32,160 --> 05:23:34,160
Blood for the blood garden

4665
05:23:41,280 --> 05:23:46,480
I'm just gonna check I didn't leave any treasure in this place

4666
05:23:47,440 --> 05:23:53,840
Because I might have left some twitters just in case I'll check the dungeon map

4667
05:23:58,000 --> 05:24:03,120
No, I cleared it out completely. Okay, that's what I like to see. That's what I like to see a little cheeky heel here

4668
05:24:03,200 --> 05:24:05,200
And thank you very much. I appreciate it

4669
05:24:06,080 --> 05:24:08,480

Ink for the ink goddess

4671
05:24:12,400 --> 05:24:14,400
Uh, was there something to the right?

4672
05:24:17,440 --> 05:24:19,440

4673
05:24:21,040 --> 05:24:23,040
So tiny

4674
05:24:24,640 --> 05:24:30,000
Wait, can I go this way then? Oh, I guess if you wanted to come out on this side, you can

4675
05:24:33,840 --> 05:24:35,840
Um

4676
05:24:39,680 --> 05:24:41,680
Is there anything I'm in there?

4677
05:24:41,840 --> 05:24:43,840
I think so

4678
05:24:44,720 --> 05:24:48,960
Wait, was there something back here I missed? Oh, I've not opened it up yet. That's why

4688
05:25:32,720 --> 05:25:34,720

4704
05:26:50,480 --> 05:26:55,360
Don't mind us. How's it going? Do any of you want to trade? No you don't

4705
05:26:55,920 --> 05:26:58,880
That's fine. Hopefully that's the last one down there

4706
05:26:59,840 --> 05:27:01,840
Oh, sorry

05:29:32,880 --> 05:29:38,160
Do you do anything else for me? There's nothing more you must train yourself. Okay

4738
05:29:38,240 --> 05:29:40,240
Okay

4739
05:29:40,480 --> 05:29:42,480
You can just jump over the bridge. Oh

05:29:45,440 --> 05:29:47,840
What's in here already picked up

4741
05:29:50,240 --> 05:29:52,800
Then what this is the way to get to the

4742
05:29:57,600 --> 05:29:59,600
The graveyard and that

4743
05:30:02,080 --> 05:30:04,080
Yeah, we're on the graveyard

4744
05:30:05,040 --> 05:30:11,040
Okay, I don't really need to come up this way, but hey home. We'll come back to the graveyard and I'm the mental

4745
05:30:15,520 --> 05:30:17,520
Unless

4746
05:30:24,800 --> 05:30:27,520
I saw that other chest there's no way

4747
05:30:27,520 --> 05:30:29,520
Hey

4748
05:30:29,680 --> 05:30:31,680
Oh my god

4749
05:30:31,840 --> 05:30:34,320
Yes, 100 shells as well

4750
05:30:35,600 --> 05:30:38,160
No way that's such a um

4751
05:30:39,840 --> 05:30:41,840
Such a hidden place

4752
05:30:42,560 --> 05:30:45,920
You can't go any further that way. We're just fine, baby. You

4753
05:30:46,960 --> 05:30:48,960
So then what's in here

4754
05:30:49,760 --> 05:30:51,760
That's just where we were. Okay

4755
05:30:52,640 --> 05:30:54,640
More shells gamer time

4756
05:30:54,640 --> 05:30:56,640
Was it this bomb left one?

4757
05:30:57,760 --> 05:31:00,640
And then we can see what it what this is all about

4758
05:31:01,680 --> 05:31:03,680
Red piece. Perfect. That's what I like to see

4759
05:31:06,240 --> 05:31:09,520
Okay, okay, what is in this chest?

4760
05:31:12,160 --> 05:31:14,800
Because it's big whatever it is. It's not like a regular chest

4761
05:31:17,280 --> 05:31:19,280
It is uh

4762
05:31:20,960 --> 05:31:25,680
You've got a magical hold the button when you throw it and use to control its path. Oh

4763
05:31:26,000 --> 05:31:28,000
So I can dictate now. Okay

4764
05:31:30,400 --> 05:31:36,560
Uh, I need to go buy shells now because I'm starting to get a lot of money on my persons again

4765
05:31:38,640 --> 05:31:44,640
We're gonna do we're actually gonna get all the gacha from and where do I need the shop the main shop

4766
05:31:50,240 --> 05:31:52,240

Buy the manual first. Okay. Yes. I will go buy the manual

4769
05:32:00,480 --> 05:32:04,400
It said you said it was 200 for the manual, right? I'll buy two

4770
05:32:06,000 --> 05:32:08,000
I'll buy two

4771
05:32:08,320 --> 05:32:10,320
Shells and then I'll have enough for the manual

4772
05:32:12,320 --> 05:32:15,920
How many you got in you? Oh, sorry. I like perfectly cover up. I've got

4773
05:32:17,040 --> 05:32:19,840
345 so we're gonna go get the manual which is 200

4774
05:32:20,800 --> 05:32:22,800
Out my way you're post-a-bam

4775
05:32:23,600 --> 05:32:25,600
right

4776
05:32:29,920 --> 05:32:35,840
I don't even know what this does. Hello, I'm selling uh swordsman's letter right now. You can buy it. Yeah, absolutely

4777
05:32:36,560 --> 05:32:43,280
Thanks for supporting remember to come out as swift as the blade right. What did that do? Is it something new? Okay, there is something new. Hello

4778
05:32:44,400 --> 05:32:46,400
Would you like to read it? Sure

4779
05:32:47,360 --> 05:32:52,160
Go wall so somewhat it may look like a regular wall, but you may find something you can bought

4780
05:32:52,160 --> 05:32:56,560
There's actually easy way to tell and I'm here to teach you build up the power and start sticking things in a wall

4781
05:32:56,560 --> 05:32:59,760
If you pay attention, you'll find a spot that makes a different sound continue

4782
05:33:01,440 --> 05:33:06,000
Don't give up start mashing buttons. You might be able to escape quickly continue reading

4783
05:33:06,240 --> 05:33:11,920
Sliftly gossip the magical boomerang somewhere in Hyrule. You can find a credibly. I just got it

4784
05:33:12,640 --> 05:33:15,920
Uh, so this is like just telling me

4785
05:33:18,320 --> 05:33:22,640
Oh, no, see you in issue two. I don't have enough for issue two

4786
05:33:24,080 --> 05:33:29,440
Manual that's plural. Well, I've just lost all my money. We need to get you first. Okay

4787
05:33:30,960 --> 05:33:35,040
100% of gamblers give up before they win or something. I don't know

4788
05:33:38,000 --> 05:33:40,400
How many shells all of them

4789
05:33:42,080 --> 05:33:46,320
Because then we don't need to put our money towards the shells anymore when we're traveling about

4790
05:33:48,400 --> 05:33:53,040
You're gonna trade 95. Yeah, I guess 95 shoes

4791
05:33:54,480 --> 05:33:56,480
Unlike the shells there aren't infinite manuals

4792
05:33:58,880 --> 05:34:04,320
Spear moblin appears in minish woods. They rush you on site. Yeah, they're great. I don't like them

4793
05:34:05,280 --> 05:34:08,320
How many have I got I've got one more roll. Oh, no

4794
05:34:09,280 --> 05:34:11,280
Yes, one more trade, please

4795
05:34:12,560 --> 05:34:14,560
One more

4796
05:34:17,120 --> 05:34:20,080
After getting every figure you can trade them for money, I believe

4797
05:34:24,080 --> 05:34:29,120
Actually that may be infinite money glitch because you get five coins for a repeated figure

4798
05:34:30,240 --> 05:34:32,240
And one shell to five

4799
05:34:33,120 --> 05:34:35,840
A trap appears a very a trap with sharp blades. Yeah

4800
05:34:36,560 --> 05:34:44,080
Right, we what was that? We need eight more things. We just need 800

4801
05:34:46,000 --> 05:34:50,640
The house has it after getting every figure you can trade them the house has a money on heart. Yes

4802
05:34:50,640 --> 05:34:53,600
There's definitely a heart in that like casino type thing

4803
05:34:55,040 --> 05:34:57,040
Um

4804
05:34:58,160 --> 05:35:04,160
I've lined up a sizable pile of cash for my maybe I should start breeding pets next. No, that's the mean

4805
05:35:06,000 --> 05:35:09,440
I think the time has come. I've moved beyond words

4806
05:35:14,080 --> 05:35:18,800
Um, that's for gamba wait, I keep going in here, but I've already done it

4807
05:35:20,560 --> 05:35:22,560
Breeding the leaflings

4808
05:35:24,960 --> 05:35:26,960
I think I've done

4809
05:35:28,720 --> 05:35:30,720
What I can

4810
05:35:31,040 --> 05:35:33,600
In this area was there someone in school

4811
05:35:33,840 --> 05:35:40,240
Oh, the teachers are gone. Oh, they've changed. I have to see the kids off home myself

4812
05:35:40,400 --> 05:35:44,960
Yes, you need to look after the wanes, believe it or not. Oh, the children aren't eating anymore

4813
05:35:47,360 --> 05:35:50,320
Oh, no one's even playing outside. That's so sad

4814
05:35:52,080 --> 05:35:55,040
Gimli I can hear it going up

4815
05:35:57,120 --> 05:36:00,720
Uh, I can't remember. Is this the but okay, that's the bomb side. We don't need to do that

4816
05:36:04,560 --> 05:36:06,560
Mm-hmm

4817
05:36:08,720 --> 05:36:13,040
And a new mpc gonna spawn oh look at the meatball

4818
05:36:18,000 --> 05:36:22,160
Uh, right, where have we not we did go down in the swamp

4819
05:36:23,040 --> 05:36:24,320
Western

4820
05:36:24,320 --> 05:36:27,520
Highlands we've not mocked about in the graveyard

4821
05:36:28,000 --> 05:36:32,720
Let's go with the graveyard. I know this seems really weird. We've no mocked about in the graveyard

4822
05:36:33,840 --> 05:36:35,840
Can it show them

4823
05:36:35,920 --> 05:36:38,720
It's graveyard. Oh, I think it's off a bit more

4824
05:36:47,680 --> 05:36:49,680
Wait, is it? No it is

4825
05:36:51,680 --> 05:36:53,680
But I can't go that way

4826
05:36:56,960 --> 05:36:59,840
Hardly mean for being so rude it wasn't

4827
05:37:04,560 --> 05:37:06,560
Hmm

4828
05:37:06,960 --> 05:37:11,920
Let's see if there's anything to do in the graveyard that we technically haven't done

4829
05:37:14,560 --> 05:37:16,560
Okay

4830
05:37:18,160 --> 05:37:22,720
Oh, there's so many sections of the map

4831
05:37:25,200 --> 05:37:29,520
The lily pad I forgot to do the lily pad in the swamp. We're gonna go back and do that

4832
05:37:29,920 --> 05:37:35,760
I like if you've interacted with it. It's no longer on the map. I actually really appreciate that. Thank you game devs

4833
05:37:38,560 --> 05:37:40,560
Um

4834
05:37:40,800 --> 05:37:43,680
Post office still needs something to do the placement

4835
05:37:45,600 --> 05:37:51,760
There's a waterfall. Okay. Actually, this is like really handy dandy when interested math. It's just

4836
05:37:53,360 --> 05:37:55,360
Building

4837
05:37:55,920 --> 05:38:07,120
We're to go to the mystic hut. There's a treasure chest and there's a monster. Okay. This is like so I didn't really even did this for you

4838
05:38:08,720 --> 05:38:13,760
That's fantastic. Honestly, right? Let's deal with the graveyard first

4839
05:38:15,200 --> 05:38:17,200
Let me let me give a light on

4840
05:38:18,080 --> 05:38:23,840
Literally such a like quality of item type a quality of life type thing for games to put in

4841
05:38:25,600 --> 05:38:27,760
They didn't have to go this hard and yet here we are

4842
05:38:29,280 --> 05:38:38,880
Shawnee is close to 8k. I'm going to try and schedule the clapping video. I've already got the artwork. Wait, what's down here?

4843
05:38:44,400 --> 05:38:50,160
Is it the same way is it north? Yeah north

4844
05:38:50,720 --> 05:38:52,720
North

4845
05:38:54,320 --> 05:38:58,080
North left left north

4846
05:39:00,160 --> 05:39:03,440
Right, anyway, I'll start from scratch. So north left

4847
05:39:05,680 --> 05:39:08,080
Left pressure's up

4848
05:39:12,640 --> 05:39:16,240

4911
05:44:32,640 --> 05:44:36,720
I don't know why I've been such a nasty little prankster all of a sudden. I feel like a week's been lifted

4912
05:44:36,720 --> 05:44:41,360
I feel like I've made up for all my dreadful deeds. Hey spooktor. See you in paradise

4913
05:44:41,920 --> 05:44:50,160
Okay, we can get access into the chicken farm now. I'm curious. What are you doing here? Yes

4914
05:44:52,480 --> 05:44:54,480
Okay, uh

Well, whatever it did. It must be worth it. Thank you. Thank you

4917
05:45:03,200 --> 05:45:08,000
Red piece. I'll take it. Uh, I've already pushed all of these haven't I?

4918
05:45:08,240 --> 05:45:10,960
I don't know what that unlocked

4919
05:45:13,600 --> 05:45:15,600
But it made the unlock noise

4920
05:45:17,280 --> 05:45:19,280
Pushing all these graves

4921
05:45:21,040 --> 05:45:24,720

05:45:27,600 --> 05:45:32,080
I could swim faster man. You can read fast if you read that even I didn't read and I'm the one playing the game

4924
05:45:32,960 --> 05:45:34,960
I can't even read that fast

4925
05:45:38,160 --> 05:45:40,640
Dig on it. I did try and dig on it before

4926
05:45:41,360 --> 05:45:44,880
Right, hold on. I'm gonna come back to her in case she wants to trade multiple times

4927
05:45:48,320 --> 05:45:52,480
Ah, no, you came back. I'm so happy in this group, but please make yourself feel at home

4928
05:45:53,760 --> 05:45:56,480
Mmm. I mean technically it'll be home once um

4929
05:45:57,920 --> 05:45:59,040
So

4930
05:45:59,040 --> 05:46:03,120
Is she actually that wrong? Do you want to trade again? No, you've traded out

4931
05:46:04,800 --> 05:46:06,800
Um

4932
05:46:08,000 --> 05:46:12,000
Hold on. I'll put the v ocarina on a ocarina. Wow

4933
05:46:15,200 --> 05:46:20,640

4934
05:46:22,640 --> 05:46:24,640
Oh dig the dirt in the group

4935
05:46:25,760 --> 05:46:32,400
I did try it. I did try it before I don't know why it wouldn't let me do it the first time if that is actually the solution

4936
05:46:33,120 --> 05:46:38,000
Um, right. I need to be we and I need to go inside the chicken house

4937
05:46:38,560 --> 05:46:41,280
So I will go in here. Do you want to trade? No, you don't

4938
05:46:43,040 --> 05:46:47,600
You should visit the minish. It's probably been five minutes. I agree. It probably has

4939
05:46:49,520 --> 05:46:51,520
Right, what's going on in this chicken house?

4940
05:46:55,200 --> 05:46:58,960
Oh, shit fucking get me out of here

4941
05:46:59,920 --> 05:47:07,120
What the kinstone piece fused and disappeared now? I can't get it now. I can't get it back to anju. I'm still happy

4942
05:47:09,920 --> 05:47:12,240

Fewer people means less trash. I'm having a tough time fading. Oh, no, he's a swing kind of swing

4946
05:47:32,480 --> 05:47:34,800
Okay, get me to normal size again

4947
05:47:37,760 --> 05:47:39,760
Go back three left and three up

4948
05:47:45,840 --> 05:47:47,840
Three left and three up

4949
05:47:48,400 --> 05:47:56,800
And you is the chicken lady, is she gonna trade me a kinstone? Oh, no

4950
05:48:05,360 --> 05:48:08,880
Oh wait, I have these shoes now. I can go to the chickens really fast

4951
05:48:11,280 --> 05:48:13,280
I know I don't what can cycle pass that

4952
05:48:14,240 --> 05:48:19,040
Oh, well, right. I'm not going for the gold chickens, I guess because they don't actually stay

4953
05:48:22,720 --> 05:48:27,440
No, I can't run with the chicken in my hand. No, I'm gonna mess up. Okay. I messed up

4954
05:48:27,440 --> 05:48:31,200
I won't go for the golden ones because the golden ones don't stay in your hand

4955
05:48:32,160 --> 05:48:38,080
Hmm. Well, it's like I'm still missing a lot of cuckoos, but thank well, maybe if you didn't have some golden bam ones

4956
05:48:40,800 --> 05:48:42,800
Oh, I hurt him

4957

Sorry, look a bit of animal violence never really hurt anyone. Just hurt the animal

4958
05:48:52,000 --> 05:48:56,640
Maybe if it didn't run halfway across the map, I could actually have a chance to get the dying thing

4959
05:48:58,480 --> 05:49:03,360
Oh, no pick it up. All right. There are four. Is that how much you needed?

Oh

5004
05:52:49,280 --> 05:52:52,640
Come back later for the rest. I've got 169

5005
05:52:54,720 --> 05:52:59,760
Um, right cuckoo. Let's go again. Sorry. Sorry didn't mean to stab you with my

5006
05:53:00,640 --> 05:53:02,720
my pointy

5007
05:53:02,720 --> 05:53:04,720
reward

5008
05:53:05,120 --> 05:53:07,200
Oh, I'm burping away over here. Sorry, right

5009
05:53:10,160 --> 05:53:12,880
Yes, what are the spawn locations?

5010
05:53:13,840 --> 05:53:19,680
Okay, it's very unlikely the first time we do this we get it because of the spawn locations changing

5011
05:53:21,920 --> 05:53:26,160
Uh, wow, they are not close by holy moly

5012
05:53:27,360 --> 05:53:29,360
That's the spawn locations

5013
05:53:30,160 --> 05:53:32,160
Halfway across the map

5014
05:53:32,160 --> 05:53:33,600
The third and fourth

5015
05:53:33,600 --> 05:53:37,760
Oh my god, get out of my way guard if you could evaporate that'd be classic right now

5016
05:53:37,760 --> 05:53:42,080
That'd honestly be classic. I could only have four she wants six

5017
05:53:43,120 --> 05:53:44,640
Oh

5018
05:53:44,640 --> 05:53:46,640
dear

5019
05:53:46,640 --> 05:53:49,920
At least the white ones tolerate you like holding them

5020
05:53:51,440 --> 05:53:53,440
Only

5021
05:53:54,000 --> 05:53:57,520
How am I supposed to get six to her? I can't pick up

5022
05:53:58,640 --> 05:54:03,200
I'm out of time unless I can throw it. Can I eat it? Can I punch it? Can I punch it? Oh

5023
05:54:06,560 --> 05:54:11,120
What was that? Hmm not enough. Why are they so far away?

5024
05:54:12,960 --> 05:54:14,960
Need no clips. She said five

5025
05:54:16,560 --> 05:54:20,000
And wait, I could have done it if I didn't mess up the pickup right hold on

5026
05:54:20,000 --> 05:54:24,240
I can't remember where the other ones where I've already freaking forgotten right. There was one on the staircase

5027
05:54:24,320 --> 05:54:29,680
You're coming with me right. There's one also there by the staircase. It's just fine. We can come back for him

5028
05:54:30,800 --> 05:54:32,800
Pegasus boots

5029
05:54:33,360 --> 05:54:35,360
Okay, two

5030
05:54:35,360 --> 05:54:38,640
Okay, okay, and then there was one by the bridge and one by the dojo

5031
05:54:39,520 --> 05:54:40,560
Oh

5032
05:54:40,560 --> 05:54:44,000
Okay, no, don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that. You don't want to do that

5033
05:54:44,000 --> 05:54:51,120
It's fine. It's fine. Just allow the knife to impale your no your little chicken meaty body. Stop. Stop

5034
05:54:51,600 --> 05:54:53,920
Stop. Oh, right. We're gonna have to redo this one

5035
05:54:55,760 --> 05:55:01,040
But we know stop stop just accept the the impolition

5036
05:55:01,840 --> 05:55:03,840
Right at least we know

5037
05:55:04,560 --> 05:55:11,760
Three to the left to north. We know we know. Oh, I can use the bridge as well. I forgot about that

5038
05:55:12,560 --> 05:55:13,600
Right

5039
05:55:13,600 --> 05:55:17,440
Give me a chance. Give me a chance kids game by the way. Give me a chance

5040
05:55:18,400 --> 05:55:20,400
Right two up north. Let's go

5041
05:55:21,840 --> 05:55:26,240
Easy easy easy get this freaking beast that are checking first

5042
05:55:27,280 --> 05:55:31,040
Easy easy into the pen into the pen

5043
05:55:31,280 --> 05:55:35,200
Easy to pick it up

5044
05:55:36,880 --> 05:55:42,240
Lunk, you know exactly what I was getting you to pick up there. Oh my god. I'm spending 20 seconds getting those two

5045
05:55:46,880 --> 05:55:51,840
Stop it stop it. Oh, I keep I give up

5046
05:55:52,880 --> 05:55:58,640
There's no point. I give up. I give up. I'm going in the house. Fuck you. I'm resetting. I'm resetting. I need a reset

5047
05:55:59,600 --> 05:56:02,000
Maybe I should go for the ones to the left first

5048
05:56:05,200 --> 05:56:08,160
Give me a chicken body. Yeah, we bam you

5049
05:56:10,160 --> 05:56:12,160
Oh

5050
05:56:12,400 --> 05:56:15,600
Literally how long to get this first one in the post

5051
05:56:20,640 --> 05:56:22,640
It's fine

5052
05:56:29,520 --> 05:56:31,520
It's

5053
05:56:36,080 --> 05:56:38,080
It's fine that he keeps getting caught in the same

5054
05:56:58,640 --> 05:57:00,640
Oh

5055
05:57:14,400 --> 05:57:21,600
Don't ever lose those chickens again. Do you understand me young lady? Don't you

5056
05:57:22,800 --> 05:57:25,120
Ever lose those chickens again

5057
05:57:25,120 --> 05:57:29,920
Here's your reward. I appreciate the shells

5058
05:57:32,240 --> 05:57:34,240
She's not done

5059
05:57:39,120 --> 05:57:41,120
She's not done

5060
05:57:44,000 --> 05:57:46,000
Now do six in a minute

5061
05:57:48,400 --> 05:57:51,440
Oh, please tell me she gives a heart piece

5062
05:57:55,280 --> 05:58:05,360
All right, one's right at the door. That's fine. One's by the water. That's fine

5063
05:58:09,200 --> 05:58:12,240
One's by the shop the general store

5064
05:58:13,680 --> 05:58:15,680
Up the waterfall maybe

5065
05:58:16,800 --> 05:58:18,800
No

5066
05:58:19,760 --> 05:58:25,920
Well, you're probably going to be a lot faster. Okay, we know there's no two up north which is fine

5067
05:58:26,720 --> 05:58:31,040
And there's not one by the dog. We're just doing information gathering on this one. Okay

5068
05:58:31,760 --> 05:58:33,760
It's not a big deal

5069
05:58:33,760 --> 05:58:34,880
Okay

5070
05:58:34,880 --> 05:58:37,680
Yeah, I do not have enough time to reach

5071
05:58:39,520 --> 05:58:42,000
Unless pause

5072
05:58:45,280 --> 05:58:47,280
Oh, we did it

5073
05:58:47,920 --> 05:58:49,920
Oh

5074
05:58:56,400 --> 05:58:58,400
It's it's not over

5075
05:59:00,320 --> 05:59:04,640
It's not over it's not hashtag over

5076
05:59:08,320 --> 05:59:13,840
Uh, we'll buy the next manual because she's actually given us enough money to buy all the manual so

5077
05:59:14,800 --> 05:59:16,800
I'll buy the next one

5078
05:59:18,640 --> 05:59:24,320
Just unequipped your sword. I never even thought of that. Holy crap. Where have you been all my life?

5079
05:59:26,400 --> 05:59:29,440
No, we all had to do is unequip the sword

5080
05:59:30,880 --> 05:59:35,680
So the chickens would stop running halfway across the map when I touched them with my pointy sword

5081
05:59:36,800 --> 05:59:40,480
Yeah, take that right. Well, I definitely don't want to accidentally activate that item

5082
05:59:43,920 --> 05:59:45,920
Decape a terrible idea

5083
05:59:47,760 --> 05:59:51,840
All of these seem like terrible ideas have it. What do you want?

5084
05:59:53,760 --> 05:59:57,840
She gives me an extra five seconds to catch a whole other chicken

5085
05:59:58,880 --> 06:00:01,600
Oh, you're taking the absolute mincemeat honestly

5086
06:00:03,680 --> 06:00:08,960
Oh, all right. Okay. I'm not right. Okay. This is just information gathering clearly

5087
06:00:09,920 --> 06:00:14,640
One by the stairs. Is there one by the dog? There is one by the dog. Okay

5088
06:00:17,120 --> 06:00:21,280
Okay, let's try the waterfall. I call it the waterfall, but it's not one here

5089
06:00:21,600 --> 06:00:27,520
I am not picking up a golden chicken. I actually refuse. I'd call me chickenist. I don't care

5090
06:00:28,160 --> 06:00:33,280
I am not picking up a golden chicken. They are liars. They are cheats and they smell bad

5091
06:00:36,000 --> 06:00:38,000
Okay

5092
06:00:38,480 --> 06:00:43,920
Is that six? One, two, three, four, five, six. Oh my god, we did it. It's so much easier if you just don't touch them

5093
06:00:46,640 --> 06:00:48,640
That's up

5094
06:00:49,360 --> 06:00:51,360
Please be done

5095
06:00:51,920 --> 06:00:53,920
That's it. You got

5096
06:00:54,160 --> 06:00:56,160
Oh, please woman

5097
06:00:56,480 --> 06:00:58,480
Oh, please woman

5098
06:01:00,400 --> 06:01:02,400
70

5099
06:01:02,640 --> 06:01:04,640
Can I even pick? Oh

5100
06:01:04,720 --> 06:01:13,760
Just restart just I'm not even entertaining it. I'm not even entertaining it. Yes, I will I will help

5101
06:01:15,200 --> 06:01:17,200
One

5102
06:01:19,760 --> 06:01:21,760
Two

5103
06:01:22,640 --> 06:01:25,600
Is there one by the dog? Not there I can see

5104
06:01:27,440 --> 06:01:31,600
Oh, there is but it's golden. Don't trust it. Don't trust the golden chicken

5105
06:01:35,440 --> 06:01:38,480
Oh, maybe trust it a little bit because we can just start right in

5106
06:01:40,560 --> 06:01:42,560
Fuck you

5107
06:01:45,600 --> 06:01:48,240
I don't know what number oh postman give the

5108
06:01:49,200 --> 06:01:51,200
fucking road

5109
06:01:51,200 --> 06:01:53,200
Get out of the fucking road

5110
06:01:53,360 --> 06:02:00,240
Right, what happens if I do this? Do you just accept it? Oh my god. Go go go towards the pen into the pen

5111
06:02:00,880 --> 06:02:02,880
Did I do it? Did that count?

5112
06:02:03,680 --> 06:02:05,680
Oh my god, did that count? I don't know

5113
06:02:06,400 --> 06:02:08,080
Go into the pen

5114
06:02:08,080 --> 06:02:10,480
No, don't go back you silly sausage

5115
06:02:11,360 --> 06:02:15,920
Go into the pen into the pen and no, did I get it? I don't know if I got did that count

5116
06:02:18,640 --> 06:02:20,640
No way that worked

5117
06:02:21,840 --> 06:02:25,040
190 rupees. Well, I guess we'll go buy the

5118
06:02:26,400 --> 06:02:31,280
The next manual because she's actually giving me so many rupees we can buy all the manuals

5119
06:02:33,840 --> 06:02:42,240
Not to be confused with Emmanuel the one viewer from Mexico watching us right now speak welcome. I'm selling. Yes, you are. Yes, please

5120
06:02:42,400 --> 06:02:44,400
I'd like to buy

5121
06:02:44,880 --> 06:02:48,000
I'm literally smurfed that golden one honestly. I don't know how I did that

5122
06:02:56,960 --> 06:03:02,000
Wait, how many I can do another getcha. I think there's at least eight left

5123
06:03:03,040 --> 06:03:05,040
women

5124
06:03:11,200 --> 06:03:13,680
I don't trust it

5125
06:03:15,680 --> 06:03:17,680
I don't trust it

5126
06:03:19,120 --> 06:03:24,480
I don't trust it. They like on the other side of the okay. They're like literally on the other side of the map

5127
06:03:27,520 --> 06:03:29,520
Right one is behind the

5128
06:03:30,480 --> 06:03:34,720
Shoe shop as for the other one

5129
06:03:36,960 --> 06:03:40,560
There's where exactly by the skull no

5130
06:03:42,880 --> 06:03:44,880
I don't know

5131
06:03:47,280 --> 06:03:50,640
By the exit, I don't know if I'm gonna make it over there in time

5132
06:03:52,720 --> 06:03:53,920
Maybe

5133
06:03:53,920 --> 06:03:55,920
If no one gets in my way

5134
06:03:56,800 --> 06:04:00,000
I said if no one gets in my way then maybe I can make it

5135
06:04:02,240 --> 06:04:04,800
We may have done it we may have done it

5136
06:04:06,000 --> 06:04:09,840
Wow, we actually did it. Please be the last one and I'm so tired

5137
06:04:10,800 --> 06:04:12,800
Time's up. Time's up. Yes. Yes

5138
06:04:14,160 --> 06:04:16,400
Thanks. Here's your reward king stone piece

5139
06:04:19,280 --> 06:04:21,280
Darling

5140
06:04:21,600 --> 06:04:23,600
What do you want now three

5141
06:04:24,320 --> 06:04:27,920
And they're on the other side of the map, of course, because why wouldn't they be?

5142
06:04:30,320 --> 06:04:32,320
No

5143
06:04:32,320 --> 06:04:38,320
No, I don't know right. This is just information gathering. I'm not even

5144
06:04:44,800 --> 06:04:48,880
Is there any on this side of the map? I don't think so because the dog would block you

5145
06:04:49,840 --> 06:04:53,840
Right, are you John? Get another

5146
06:04:55,200 --> 06:04:57,200
That's what I think about you as well

5147
06:04:59,600 --> 06:05:03,760
All right, let's just check out the town center nothing

5148
06:05:06,080 --> 06:05:10,480
A golden one is I have to contend with two golden chickens

5149
06:05:11,600 --> 06:05:13,600
Oh, I don't know if I can do that

5150
06:05:14,240 --> 06:05:16,960
Sorry, we're gonna have to do a bit more information gather

5151
06:05:17,120 --> 06:05:21,040
That's the three two golden and one weight from halfway across the map

5152
06:05:22,000 --> 06:05:24,000
Oh, I don't know about that darling

5153
06:05:27,600 --> 06:05:29,600
I don't know if I can do this

5154
06:05:30,160 --> 06:05:36,400
It's the last mission is it actually you're not trolling me. She shouldn't be able to have chickens. I haven't much I drown

5155
06:05:36,400 --> 06:05:38,400
I'm honestly

5156
06:05:40,160 --> 06:05:42,160
Uh, right, we'll do a run

5157
06:05:43,600 --> 06:05:50,960
We're gonna swim across the water to get that blue one the white one. Sorry and literally run like nothing on earth

5158
06:05:53,040 --> 06:05:54,640
Wait unless

5159
06:05:54,640 --> 06:05:59,760
Can I throw it without getting in the water? I can okay curious curious

5160
06:06:00,240 --> 06:06:04,160
That's probably our solution. Unfortunately. It does get a bit freaked out

5161
06:06:05,280 --> 06:06:07,680
But if that is our solution

5162
06:06:07,920 --> 06:06:09,120
I

5163
06:06:09,120 --> 06:06:14,160
Was going to say to because to go all the way around seems pretty impossible from being honest

5164
06:06:14,240 --> 06:06:19,440
And then the golden one should be here go down here and then pick you up and go down there and pick you up

5165
06:06:19,440 --> 06:06:23,120
Then go down there and freaking pick you up and then go there

5166
06:06:23,680 --> 06:06:27,760
No pick you up and then go there right. I've not got it

5167
06:06:27,920 --> 06:06:32,480
But I think I have the mechanics that I'm supposed to participate in down

5168
06:06:33,120 --> 06:06:34,960
which is fine

5169
06:06:34,960 --> 06:06:38,000
I kind of just need to like pick it up so it doesn't change its mind

5170
06:06:43,120 --> 06:06:48,480
We are never having the velar farm at this rate. No not by the way. I'm fucking handling these champions honestly

5171
06:06:50,240 --> 06:06:52,240
Right get the white one first

5172
06:06:56,240 --> 06:07:02,000
No, don't get stuck on something long. We're literally in a time crunch right don't

5173
06:07:02,960 --> 06:07:08,960
Okay, much better much better strats are coming in strats are coming in I repeat strats are coming

5174
06:07:09,680 --> 06:07:11,680
Call me strats because I'm coming

5175
06:07:12,800 --> 06:07:17,600
Right, there's one up here pick them up throw them down the alleyway pick them up

5176
06:07:32,240 --> 06:07:38,400
Not now not now buddy not now. Oh

5177
06:07:40,080 --> 06:07:42,480
No, I did it. No way

5178
06:07:43,360 --> 06:07:47,600
That better be the last one reflin or I'm gonna take you out for telling me fibbers

5179
06:07:49,200 --> 06:07:53,360
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you

5180
06:07:55,440 --> 06:07:57,440
Oh, it's over

5181
06:07:58,000 --> 06:08:04,000
No, you're on your own you've given me what I need couldn't get less of a shite

5182
06:08:04,560 --> 06:08:08,240
Couldn't get less of a shite if your flock goes out hen

5183
06:08:09,120 --> 06:08:11,120
That is your problem

5184
06:08:11,760 --> 06:08:15,600
You are so incompetent and I couldn't gear at us

5185
06:08:18,800 --> 06:08:23,120
Now it's repeatable for crap cash, okay. Yes, I would like a guide

5186
06:08:23,680 --> 06:08:25,680
Please

5187
06:08:28,640 --> 06:08:31,440
Uh, right we are going to go small

5188
06:08:33,280 --> 06:08:37,520
So we can talk to the minish that's currently inside this house

5189
06:08:38,480 --> 06:08:40,480
Oh

5190
06:08:48,720 --> 06:08:53,200
Chimney a bit of a chimney moment. Oh, pardon me

5191
06:08:58,480 --> 06:09:00,480
I need to break the pots

5192
06:09:03,120 --> 06:09:05,440
Oh, I need to break the pots

5193
06:09:06,320 --> 06:09:08,320
I

5194
06:09:08,880 --> 06:09:13,520
Need to of course I need to uh, sorry. Sorry. Don't how could I be so silly?

5195
06:09:13,680 --> 06:09:20,000
Of course, I would need to break the pots in her house first in order to enable me to do what I need

5196
06:09:20,320 --> 06:09:22,320
Of course, don't be silly

5197
06:09:23,600 --> 06:09:29,360
How preposterous of me to break a pot. I'll break your fucking pot honestly

5198
06:09:31,280 --> 06:09:33,280
Right, let's try that

5199
06:09:35,440 --> 06:09:37,440
Break a pot

5200
06:09:37,680 --> 06:09:39,680
Why wouldn't I break a pot?

5201
06:09:40,560 --> 06:09:44,480
Break a fucking pot. Fucking stupid bitch having fucking pots. Hi

5202
06:09:45,440 --> 06:09:50,800
Want a charm? No, I don't actually I'm so annoyed at you for those pots and those pots better stay destroyed

5203
06:09:50,880 --> 06:09:54,880
Exactly. That's what I thought. That's what I thought. You are not replacing those pots

5204
06:09:55,040 --> 06:10:00,080
I will destroy them every single time you'll waste all your earnings and you will never quash

5205
06:10:00,800 --> 06:10:04,800
Of course, it's okay. It's okay. Of course I would need to break the pot. Why would I need to break the pot? Of course I would need to break the pot

5206
06:10:05,680 --> 06:10:07,680
I'm losing it

5207
06:10:09,280 --> 06:10:20,160
Okay, I don't know if we can a hundred percent it because unfortunately I am running very low on ideas of what I need to do next

5208
06:10:22,960 --> 06:10:26,320
I like how she doesn't notice any of this going on behind just a

5209
06:10:28,720 --> 06:10:32,800
Like really obnoxious like furniture moving noises and she's like, okay

5210
06:10:33,440 --> 06:10:36,400
Welcome, this is my new house. Uh, don't you just love the new house smell?

5211
06:10:36,480 --> 06:10:38,960
And I was just thinking about building a new house. This is great

5212
06:10:39,760 --> 06:10:44,400
Imagine moving from a musty old mushroom to a fabulous house like this. It's like a dream come true. I'm glad

5213
06:10:45,600 --> 06:10:47,600
Wait, so you don't want to like do

5214
06:10:48,720 --> 06:10:50,720
any trading

5215
06:10:51,280 --> 06:10:53,280
Okay, so I don't need to come here

5216
06:10:54,400 --> 06:10:56,400
I didn't need to come here

5217
06:10:56,880 --> 06:11:02,400
Isn't that funny right here right at this exact geo location? I didn't need to come here

5218
06:11:03,760 --> 06:11:05,760
I need one more heart

5219
06:11:05,760 --> 06:11:07,760
I need one more heart

5220
06:11:08,480 --> 06:11:14,880
Those cabinets they move all the time doesn't notice or doesn't care and I'm sure that she is zooed out her mind on her blue juice

5221
06:11:19,040 --> 06:11:22,320
Hot smash for nothing literally. I thought the game was like you have to go here

5222
06:11:22,880 --> 06:11:26,560
Right, we'll roll one more gacha. Oh, that was really cool. I'm gonna go do that game like

5223
06:11:28,640 --> 06:11:30,720
Right one more gacha because we have enough for it

5224
06:11:31,440 --> 06:11:38,160
How many shells all the shells the probability is six percent if I don't hand over the shells

5225
06:11:39,040 --> 06:11:41,520
Minish need a visit again. Yes, they do

5226
06:11:42,720 --> 06:11:48,960
Okay, we'll visit the minish and then we'll go to the top of the forest because there was a few bits and bobs that the forest have

5227
06:11:48,960 --> 06:11:50,160
No done

5228
06:11:50,160 --> 06:11:54,640
Yeah, I need to go north as soon as I enter a spike spiny choo choo

5229
06:11:54,640 --> 06:11:56,640
I

5230
06:11:56,880 --> 06:11:59,680
Was this is spiky what we've got 92

5231
06:12:00,400 --> 06:12:06,560
I don't think that's enough for a hundred percent and I'm not wasting 92 to get one. I've already got sorry, but

5232
06:12:08,480 --> 06:12:12,800
Right the minish need a visit so the visit we the minish we shall

5233
06:12:15,200 --> 06:12:18,640
And then they can tell me what goop they need because they need one more goop

5234
06:12:25,600 --> 06:12:27,600
Um

5235
06:12:28,000 --> 06:12:31,120
When you have a hundred there a new mpc will spawn right

5236
06:12:31,840 --> 06:12:34,880
We're getting incredibly close to that mpc spawn so

5237
06:12:36,320 --> 06:12:42,240
I'm quite happy. Hello. Uh, I'm gonna zoom about this place though. Just to hurry things along a bit

5238
06:12:42,240 --> 06:12:44,240
So

5239
06:12:51,120 --> 06:12:53,360
Oh do we get to watch the flowers blossom

5240
06:12:58,640 --> 06:13:01,920
Oh, they're blue look it's so helpful

5241
06:13:02,560 --> 06:13:08,400
I'm working. I need a red potion to finish. Okay red potion yet. We can definitely get you a red potion

5242
06:13:08,400 --> 06:13:15,360
Please do not worry little minish. We will return back soon when we are all big and ready for some potioning

5243
06:13:16,480 --> 06:13:19,600
Uh speaking of potioning. I actually know exactly where to go to

5244
06:13:20,320 --> 06:13:24,160
Do it because we were gonna head that way. Anyway, so this is actually worked out perfectly

5245
06:13:25,040 --> 06:13:26,720
and

5246
06:13:26,720 --> 06:13:30,080
I'm gonna do a little bit of this way the flowers

5247
06:13:31,680 --> 06:13:33,680
I do

5248
06:13:34,080 --> 06:13:38,560
Um, I'm very interested to see what kind of shitty games I can come up with

5249
06:13:39,280 --> 06:13:42,960
If I do end up doing the the game pair the root thing

5250
06:13:44,240 --> 06:13:45,440
Uh

5251
06:13:45,440 --> 06:13:46,880
Be curious

5252
06:13:46,880 --> 06:13:52,240
Because I do like I like the progression games where like you make a visible difference in the game

5253
06:13:53,040 --> 06:13:58,960
But I don't know if everyone likes that. I was like, oh, I can't believe I'm probably gonna end up making games for girls only girls

5254
06:14:00,480 --> 06:14:02,480
No boy gamers alone

5255
06:14:03,440 --> 06:14:04,480
No

5256
06:14:04,480 --> 06:14:06,480
Okay, let's beat the absolute

5257
06:14:06,800 --> 06:14:11,680
Yeah, take it take it little octordal thing. I've already forgotten how to spell your name

5258
06:14:13,760 --> 06:14:18,400
Yeah, that's right. Give me them rooms mirrors, but this is where

5259
06:14:21,440 --> 06:14:23,440
The what now the game developer

5260
06:14:25,040 --> 06:14:31,440
What's that? I can't stop and I must do a billion projects that wants to overwhelm myself. Uh, I would like this, please

5261
06:14:33,200 --> 06:14:40,160
And 150 I don't have an empty ball feign feign. What's this? Give me this. What are the practices?

5262
06:14:44,080 --> 06:14:46,080
Okay, I mean I'll take it sure

5263
06:14:47,280 --> 06:14:53,440
Yes, give me that red shape. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. Uh, do you want to trade fusion stones?

5264
06:14:55,360 --> 06:14:59,680
Back for granny's red potion one sip will have you absolutely

5265
06:15:00,320 --> 06:15:05,120
Fucking jacking. Oh, sorry granny. Jeez. What's going on with you?

5266
06:15:05,840 --> 06:15:12,960
Oh, forgive me. Sorry. Sometimes I forget to buy inhibitions. Jeez granny. That was kind of weird. Don't do that again. Okay, sorry

5267
06:15:15,120 --> 06:15:17,120
Would it be

5268
06:15:18,480 --> 06:15:20,800
Maybe faster go another way, but you know what?

5269
06:15:21,760 --> 06:15:23,760
I don't mind. Look

5270
06:15:24,160 --> 06:15:30,240
This stream was only meant to be four hours and we've accidentally turned it into an endurance stream. Oh, no. What problem?

5271
06:15:30,800 --> 06:15:34,480
What what shame that you have to listen to me ramble even more? Oh

5272
06:15:35,280 --> 06:15:39,440
Life is filled with woes and mysteries. No, no the jargon portions the blue one

5273
06:15:41,920 --> 06:15:44,080
What color are viagra pills?

5274
06:15:45,840 --> 06:15:47,840
Like viagra fall pills

5275
06:15:48,880 --> 06:15:51,200
Or did they come in a different array of colors?

5276
06:15:53,760 --> 06:15:55,760
I

5277
06:15:57,280 --> 06:15:59,600
Don't us on goal. I just send you the ever

5278
06:16:04,080 --> 06:16:07,920
They're blue only three more hours until mercy. Okay three hour

5279
06:16:08,000 --> 06:16:11,680
We've got three hour timer to complete this damn game so we can read into mercy

5280
06:16:13,520 --> 06:16:16,160
Yes, I got you red potion darlin. It's all yours

5281
06:16:17,360 --> 06:16:21,680
Well, thanks. We just need to make come back later. Okay. I will come back later

5282
06:16:22,400 --> 06:16:26,640
Right, let's check the map for what we can do

5283
06:16:28,800 --> 06:16:34,000
Nothing is highlighted there. Nothing's highlighted there. What about the lake?

5284
06:16:37,120 --> 06:16:39,120
Nothing on the lake is highlighted

5285
06:16:40,640 --> 06:16:42,640
Nothing in this area is highlighted

5286
06:16:43,680 --> 06:16:46,800
Western world two trees have moved up

5287
06:16:47,360 --> 06:16:54,880
Windrunes there was something we also missed something in the caster winds, but the claiming we actually

5288
06:16:55,280 --> 06:16:58,400
Didn't miss anything which I'm glad because that location is

5289
06:17:00,000 --> 06:17:01,280
stinky, uh

5290
06:17:01,280 --> 06:17:03,280
the castello

5291
06:17:03,280 --> 06:17:06,960
Waterfall definitely haven't explored the waterfall properly

5292
06:17:08,800 --> 06:17:10,480
The ranch

5293
06:17:10,480 --> 06:17:13,040
Gideons we haven't finished yet. We might have to

5294
06:17:13,120 --> 06:17:14,320
Do

5295
06:17:14,320 --> 06:17:16,320
See she's asking the post office

5296
06:17:19,280 --> 06:17:22,320
I think maybe we just need to talk to that wife and then she'll stop

5297
06:17:23,040 --> 06:17:24,240
bleeding

5298
06:17:24,240 --> 06:17:26,240
Right, who am I going with?

5299
06:17:26,560 --> 06:17:31,760
First western world two trees fell windrunes and swamp

5300
06:17:32,080 --> 06:17:37,600
I think swamp that was literally the only thing that we missed so we might actually go back to swamp, you know that

5301
06:17:38,480 --> 06:17:43,840
And then we'll come back and finish off whatever is going on. Azura is live now. Are they both still on?

5302
06:17:48,960 --> 06:17:51,680
That game. Yeah, that game. Yeah jellybean game

5303
06:17:52,800 --> 06:17:56,000
You missed the grave keepers instructions for directions through the wood

5304
06:17:56,960 --> 06:17:58,960
Oh, is that a secret?

5305
06:17:58,960 --> 06:18:02,640
No, the collab finish Azura is on one shot. She's addicted to one shot

5306
06:18:02,640 --> 06:18:05,600
I don't even know what one shot is. I've never heard of it since she's playing

5307
06:18:06,240 --> 06:18:11,040
Oh, I'm glad they had fun. I'll need to check out and actually watch them. So I'm sure there's a giggle first

5308
06:18:13,520 --> 06:18:16,480
The graveyard guy gave some special instructions

5309
06:18:17,920 --> 06:18:19,920
Right, we're big again

5310
06:18:19,920 --> 06:18:23,040
We're gonna go back to the swamp because there's two things we missed in the swamp

5311
06:18:24,240 --> 06:18:27,680
The mage has a hidden path. I would never have guessed to do the hidden path

5312
06:18:27,680 --> 06:18:32,160
I would have been like oh that guy's like actually losing it. He doesn't know what he's talking about hydration check

5313
06:18:35,760 --> 06:18:37,760
Um

5314
06:18:39,120 --> 06:18:43,360
I would actually be faster to do the the one that's here

5315
06:18:44,960 --> 06:18:47,360
I can't remember what it was

5316
06:18:48,160 --> 06:18:50,160
But there's something here

5317
06:18:50,800 --> 06:18:52,800
I think it was a wee minish

5318
06:18:57,760 --> 06:19:02,160
Oh my god, I I checked twitter. Thank you for everyone who like interacts with me on twitter

5319
06:19:02,160 --> 06:19:06,320

5320
06:19:06,880 --> 06:19:13,520

5321
06:19:14,160 --> 06:19:16,160

It wasn't true. It's true. It wasn't true. Are you making up fibbers?

06:19:55,840 --> 06:20:00,880
It leaves you harder, right? So is this just a debate these two ones are

5332
06:20:02,880 --> 06:20:05,040
I mean, it looks like there are debate. There's nothing to go in

Well, there's definitely a bean here, but I don't know how to activate it

5338
06:20:33,520 --> 06:20:35,520

06:21:30,000 --> 06:21:32,000
Uh, I actually need to take this

5349
06:21:32,800 --> 06:21:34,800
Right

5350
06:21:38,320 --> 06:21:44,560
I don't know I'll just let him come after me because he's literally that slow we can just do that

5351
06:21:49,200 --> 06:21:51,200
How do we

5352
06:21:52,400 --> 06:21:54,880
Oh, I didn't need to actually do anything

5353
06:21:55,920 --> 06:21:58,800
Okay, become we go down and then go down down like

5354
06:21:59,040 --> 06:22:01,040
I'm falling down

5355
06:22:01,120 --> 06:22:03,120
I'm too slow

5356
06:22:04,720 --> 06:22:07,600
It's sounding like you shadow man

5357
06:22:09,920 --> 06:22:16,720
Oh shadow. Yeah, no, I'm not even surprised although. I haven't even done anything outrageous on it yet

5358
06:22:17,680 --> 06:22:19,680
That part comes later. Okay

5359
06:22:20,240 --> 06:22:22,240
Oh

5360
06:22:26,400 --> 06:22:28,400
This better be worth it

5361
06:22:29,120 --> 06:22:31,120
It's a kinstone piece

5362
06:22:31,200 --> 06:22:36,880
I mean, I guess it's worth it, but it took me like forever to get here and I'm out

5363
06:22:37,280 --> 06:22:39,760
Oh, I just got stabbed by the plant and now I'm here

5364
06:22:41,360 --> 06:22:43,840
Can I even out jeez louise?

5365
06:22:44,720 --> 06:22:46,720
The game tested that section

5366
06:22:47,680 --> 06:22:50,960
Right. Okay. Now we need to go back and become big

5367
06:22:57,680 --> 06:23:03,920
Okay, and then I think everything in this area is thankfully done. If not something you'll unlock but we'll know about it

5368
06:23:04,960 --> 06:23:06,960
It's later up. No not birds

5369
06:23:07,440 --> 06:23:09,440

06:23:09,440 --> 06:23:11,440
Oh, yeah, you like that. Yeah

5371
06:23:11,760 --> 06:23:16,560
Sorry, I'm losing it. I'm losing it a little bit. Maybe I should get something to eat again

5372
06:23:17,600 --> 06:23:21,280
I didn't I didn't think I was gonna be streaming for long because I'm not really eating anything

5373
06:23:21,920 --> 06:23:23,920
Eh, right. We're gonna go to the rave yard

5374
06:23:24,160 --> 06:23:28,480
Um, and listen to what the old man's pathing was

5375
06:23:32,560 --> 06:23:34,560
I actually don't know what his pathing was

5376
06:23:37,440 --> 06:23:39,440
Oh, that was a direct hit jeez

5377
06:23:41,440 --> 06:23:43,440
A quick little snackie

5378
06:23:45,200 --> 06:23:49,200
You can eat me out. That's not that's not even subtle. That wasn't even subtle at all

5379
06:23:52,480 --> 06:23:57,840
Uh, what is it? It was left left left up up up. Okay, we can do that

06:24:19,360 --> 06:24:21,360
Left

5386
06:24:22,880 --> 06:24:24,880
Left

5387
06:24:25,920 --> 06:24:27,920

Okay, I'll take it

5393
06:24:46,720 --> 06:24:48,880
But there isn't any more secret on the map here

5394
06:24:50,560 --> 06:24:56,080
Nah, there isn't so who have I not or where have I not done? I just cleared out the swamp

5395
06:25:00,320 --> 06:25:05,840
It's really just doing kinstone pieces. I need people to trade kinstone, but they wouldn't stay not in the kinstone

5396
06:25:06,480 --> 06:25:12,160
Maybe the folk maybe the folk in this building will do more kinstone trades with me. Hold on. We're gonna quickly

5397
06:25:13,440 --> 06:25:14,560
Um

06:25:14,560 --> 06:25:16,560
Fly away and see if we can get kinstone

5399
06:25:17,440 --> 06:25:19,440

But I can't leave you like this. That's too inappropriate

5405
06:25:44,160 --> 06:25:48,160
Please sir, let me make the situation right. Don't report me. Okay

5406
06:25:50,400 --> 06:25:53,040
I need to keep my license. I need to pay my rent

5407
06:25:55,840 --> 06:25:57,840
Mummy's old natural heart

5408
06:25:58,800 --> 06:26:05,680

5409
06:26:08,160 --> 06:26:10,160
Your heart is so big

5410
06:26:11,280 --> 06:26:14,800
Yeah, you have massive heart all that blood that's pumping

5411

5412
06:26:23,040 --> 06:26:25,040
I'd be up for three hours

5413
06:26:25,680 --> 06:26:29,680
I cannot wait to start doing project passion project audio

5414
06:26:31,840 --> 06:26:35,360
Right, do you want to trade? Yeah, well, they really do like trading up in these parts

5415
06:26:36,480 --> 06:26:40,320

5416
06:26:41,200 --> 06:26:45,360
Oh lord, please don't stop. Oh, no, we just finished the rave yard

5417
06:26:49,920 --> 06:26:51,920
Hopefully it's just treasure

No one else to trade here

5423
06:27:14,400 --> 06:27:16,640
Jeez, I'm struggling to figure out what to do next

5424
06:27:17,520 --> 06:27:24,480
Our new universe situation is trying us into not telling us and we keep our license. Oh the other way around

5425
06:27:27,200 --> 06:27:30,640
Get them gloves on get them gloves on

06:27:40,960 --> 06:27:46,480

5429
06:27:48,080 --> 06:27:50,320
Call strong if it goes past five birth. I'll help out

Okay, the gambodiction is real

If you ever find a complete set of figures, you should tell me you do know what I'm talking about

5463
06:30:31,600 --> 06:30:34,320
Well, do get to it. Well, he really said get gamble

Oh

06:31:03,040 --> 06:31:05,040
And you don't want to fuse

5467
06:31:06,480 --> 06:31:09,520
Fine, I'll take it. You don't want to fuse with me

5468
06:31:10,240 --> 06:31:15,760
I'm actually going to swim to that other one across the water again because I felt like something should have been there

5469
06:31:15,840 --> 06:31:18,000
And maybe I missed it, but I just felt so

5470
06:31:20,320 --> 06:31:22,320
You guys don't want to fuse in general, do you?

5471
06:31:22,640 --> 06:31:26,240
No, it seems like special the minnish views. Oh, no

I'm too early

5473
06:31:31,520 --> 06:31:33,520
Are you sure this hasn't bloomed?

5474
06:31:33,840 --> 06:31:37,120
Well, I'm not calling you a liar because I can see the flowers haven't but

06:31:48,720 --> 06:31:52,080
Is there anyone in the in that minnish house that's outside the village?

5480
06:31:59,280 --> 06:32:01,920
I'll go talk to him again because I thought it was a bit sauce

5481
06:32:02,000 --> 06:32:04,480
No, I did get a heart from here. So that wasn't that bad

5482
06:32:04,880 --> 06:32:08,480
But he was like wow, I don't normally get visitors here and I'm like, well

Good job finding this place

06:32:11,840 --> 06:32:13,840
That's it

5485
06:32:14,800 --> 06:32:18,240
Oh, I like that they follow you around. Oh, look at their tails

5486
06:32:27,440 --> 06:32:31,440
He's not the one I meant I meant the one by the shrink

5487
06:32:35,120 --> 06:32:40,800
He's the bomb guy I have done it a few times with the bomb guy

5488
06:32:44,400 --> 06:32:46,400
I don't want

5489
06:32:46,720 --> 06:32:49,200
Let's check since we're too early

5490
06:32:50,480 --> 06:32:52,480
Let me go check

5491
06:32:59,280 --> 06:33:01,280
No, he's he's done

5492
06:33:02,240 --> 06:33:06,640
I'd like to ask just to make sure strongy would you be okay if I cosplay do yeah, sure

5493
06:33:06,960 --> 06:33:08,960
Uh

5494
06:33:09,280 --> 06:33:13,920
The white on my outfit is pearlescent. That's my only good luck hint because

5495
06:33:14,800 --> 06:33:17,520
I don't know how hard it is to source pearlescent material, but

5496
06:33:19,280 --> 06:33:21,280
Huh, right, let's check the HUD

5497
06:33:22,160 --> 06:33:24,480
We haven't really done much on the waterfall

5498
06:33:25,920 --> 06:33:32,960
I think we'll do the waterfall that seems like the most logical thing to do right now whilst we wait for our little um

5499
06:33:36,960 --> 06:33:38,960
I

5500
06:33:40,560 --> 06:33:46,240
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to shoot that inside the uh, the town we're able to top right

5501
06:33:47,280 --> 06:33:49,040
Oh, nope

5502
06:33:49,040 --> 06:33:52,720
When pointing my sword tree in that hole there

5503
06:33:53,840 --> 06:33:55,840
out

5504
06:33:56,240 --> 06:33:58,240
Right, let's do this

5505
06:33:59,440 --> 06:34:01,440
Nope, let's not do this currently

5506
06:34:02,560 --> 06:34:05,440
Uh, oh, it's this cavern. Okay

5507
06:34:06,880 --> 06:34:08,880
I napped and I woke up again

5508
06:34:20,880 --> 06:34:22,880
You're out

5509
06:34:26,160 --> 06:34:28,160
Okay, ever okay, I'm getting jumped

5510
06:34:28,880 --> 06:34:30,880
I

5511
06:34:32,400 --> 06:34:35,280
Have not opened up that waterfall so it's not that one

5512
06:34:36,000 --> 06:34:42,160
Oh, there's a chest there though. Do you have gacha currency? I could have flown here

5513
06:34:43,600 --> 06:34:48,240
Oh, I'm getting absolutely annihilated. Um, he pushed me off the oh my god

5514
06:34:49,040 --> 06:34:54,320
It's over. It's over. It's over. I'm literally not gonna make it. He's jumping me. He's jumping me

5515
06:34:55,200 --> 06:34:57,520
The insects are winning the insects are actually winning

5516
06:34:58,560 --> 06:35:04,320
Right, right, that's it. I can't even charge it up to do a spin attack. Oh my god. I'm actually gonna die

5517
06:35:05,360 --> 06:35:07,680
No way. I'm gonna die. Stop

5518
06:35:08,320 --> 06:35:12,960
Right, that's it. We need to suck off these other ones unless he like jumps off. No. Oh my god

5519
06:35:12,960 --> 06:35:14,960
I just keep spawning in more enemies

5526
06:35:53,280 --> 06:35:55,280
I'm getting jumped

5527
06:35:56,080 --> 06:35:58,080
I'm getting jumped by everyone all at once

5528
06:35:58,800 --> 06:36:00,800
No, I get in the water

5529
06:36:01,120 --> 06:36:03,120
Fuck off me bam

5530
06:36:03,840 --> 06:36:05,840
Fucking waterfall bam

5531
06:36:06,560 --> 06:36:14,480
Oh, that's exactly what I needed. Thank you. You've completed a new heart container. Thank gosh. So there's only what 12 on the map somewhere

5532
06:36:15,520 --> 06:36:17,520
That was awful

5533
06:36:17,520 --> 06:36:19,520
I'm getting freaking annihilated there

5534
06:36:19,680 --> 06:36:26,080
You phone there you wouldn't know there's a bomb room in the cave you just got

5535
06:36:29,120 --> 06:36:33,360
Wait, that was real. I thought it wasn't real. I knew it was hard to know

5536
06:36:35,200 --> 06:36:37,200
I was like, huh

5537
06:36:37,680 --> 06:36:44,080
Did you end up getting that red kinson piece for the tingle brother? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got all the tingleys

5538
06:36:45,040 --> 06:36:50,960
I cannot for the life of me remember what I'm supposed to do right. No, no go up the stairs

5539
06:36:53,680 --> 06:36:55,680
And go along

5540
06:37:00,640 --> 06:37:02,640
These are all in my way

5541
06:37:03,440 --> 06:37:07,360
Right. Thank goodness. I have so much health because I don't have to like contend with everything all at once

5542
06:37:08,160 --> 06:37:10,160
this

5543
06:37:14,400 --> 06:37:17,440
What does it do? Is he saying far?

5544
06:37:26,480 --> 06:37:30,640
How does he come up? He's hating from me

5545
06:37:38,080 --> 06:37:41,200
He's just making Goro noises throw something at him

5546
06:37:42,160 --> 06:37:47,760
I'm gonna hurt him. Maybe a ball of them. Oh, I can't do anything. I'm completely rocked in

5547
06:37:51,040 --> 06:37:53,040
You have to dock with someone

5548
06:37:53,200 --> 06:37:58,480
Okay, good night. Thanks for hanging for anyone. Please do not feel bad if you need to rest get all the rest

Oh, what is this? This is to backtrack, isn't it? Yes

5551
06:38:06,960 --> 06:38:11,280
Then be trolled. What was in here then? Oh, I got it wherever it was

5552
06:38:14,400 --> 06:38:16,400
Good girl. Mm-hmm

5553
06:38:18,960 --> 06:38:26,800
Good thing I'm not feeling submissive right now. That's right. Wait, there's only one of these left. Is the game gonna remember?

5554
06:38:28,480 --> 06:38:30,480
Is the game gonna remember?

5555
06:38:32,080 --> 06:38:35,360
He like gets up so quickly that I can't even suck them though

5556
06:38:36,480 --> 06:38:41,040
Mm-hmm right there that dig spot dig dig

5557
06:38:42,720 --> 06:38:44,720
Dig spot

06:38:50,720 --> 06:38:55,360
I'm here for the long haul. I'm on vacation from work. Yeah, I literally can

5559
06:38:57,200 --> 06:38:59,200
Wait, there's a dig spot back there

5560
06:39:01,520 --> 06:39:03,520
Back in here

5561
06:39:04,480 --> 06:39:06,480
Opposite eye of the chest

5562
06:39:10,080 --> 06:39:12,080
In here

5563
06:39:14,960 --> 06:39:17,840
Nope outside. Wait, so I was in the right place

5564
06:39:21,040 --> 06:39:23,040
Other eye

5565
06:39:23,760 --> 06:39:25,760
Ah

5566
06:39:29,440 --> 06:39:31,440
That

5567
06:39:31,520 --> 06:39:34,880
You know what I've actually had enough of you mate. There's no way you're gonna survive

5568
06:39:36,320 --> 06:39:38,320
How have you seen refusing to die?

5569
06:39:39,760 --> 06:39:41,760
The rocks are skull shaped

5570
06:39:44,560 --> 06:39:50,000
That's what you want to drink. Stranny you are so blind. I'm getting nuked to death by this thing that I can't kill

5571
06:39:50,800 --> 06:39:53,200
He literally won't even go in the paw

5572
06:39:56,880 --> 06:40:01,680
He's refusing to suck because he's mental so you got to smash him or something

5573
06:40:02,960 --> 06:40:04,960
I'm freaking trying

5574
06:40:06,480 --> 06:40:09,600
Fuck off man. Right. Was that what I was supposed to do?

5575
06:40:11,600 --> 06:40:13,600
Have I done everything that you do in this area?

5576
06:40:14,080 --> 06:40:16,080
I

5577
06:40:17,840 --> 06:40:24,160
I'm seeing guy refused to get sucked. Honestly. Is that everything I had to do this little bit? No stop. It's not no

5578
06:40:27,200 --> 06:40:29,200
What else is here?

5579
06:40:32,560 --> 06:40:40,480
First Ronnie still a bomb room left. There's a bomb wall. Where the fire skull was

5580
06:40:44,160 --> 06:40:46,160
Down here down here

5581
06:40:48,160 --> 06:40:50,400
I can see there's something here. I have an access

5582
06:40:53,360 --> 06:40:56,160
On the way down. Yes down. Okay down down I go

5583
06:40:57,600 --> 06:41:02,560
I'm following the reef flingsery flingsery flings are following the reef flings

5584
06:41:03,440 --> 06:41:05,440
Because I am a good girl

5585
06:41:05,520 --> 06:41:06,400

5586
06:41:06,400 --> 06:41:07,760

06:41:07,760 --> 06:41:09,600
Bomba go

5588
06:41:09,600 --> 06:41:13,600
You don't saw that a little bit, but then I never went for it because I was like no, that's silly

5589
06:41:15,120 --> 06:41:19,200
Following the reef flingsery flingsery flingsery flingsery

5590
06:41:20,880 --> 06:41:22,880
They're gonna

5591
06:41:23,760 --> 06:41:25,760
Ski week

5592
06:41:27,760 --> 06:41:29,760
No, no logic puzzle

5593
06:41:33,520 --> 06:41:35,520
Well, I can only push it to the side

5594
06:41:40,320 --> 06:41:43,600
Oh geez how many of you did just spawn?

5595
06:41:50,000 --> 06:41:52,000
If I push it down by one

5596
06:41:55,040 --> 06:41:57,360
I don't ever recall doing this, but

5597
06:41:59,600 --> 06:42:01,600
Oh, that was so tricky. Oh, no

5598
06:42:03,120 --> 06:42:05,120
Yes, we got the shell

5599
06:42:06,400 --> 06:42:08,400
Oh

5600
06:42:08,880 --> 06:42:10,880
Yeah

5601
06:42:13,600 --> 06:42:15,600
Oh shit

5602
06:42:16,560 --> 06:42:18,560
This

5603
06:42:20,080 --> 06:42:22,400
In order to get out. Okay. Okay. I understand

5604
06:42:25,760 --> 06:42:30,640
I saw a go go go go go go. Oh, sorry. Sorry a little brazilis there

5605
06:42:34,080 --> 06:42:36,080
Probably better I don't like go that one

5606
06:42:38,960 --> 06:42:43,680
I did it. I did it. Does the ghost respawn? No he doesn't

5607
06:42:44,880 --> 06:42:46,880
You can teleport

5608
06:42:46,960 --> 06:42:48,240
Probably

5609
06:42:48,240 --> 06:42:54,320
Okay, surely the minish flowers are done by now considering how long that took me to figure out

5610
06:42:55,520 --> 06:42:57,520
Surely

5611
06:42:58,000 --> 06:43:02,480
Surely the minish flower is done by now. There's no way it's not

5612
06:43:04,480 --> 06:43:06,480
Yes

5613
06:43:07,440 --> 06:43:09,440

All right, let me get my let me get my speedy goons hours

5615
06:43:24,720 --> 06:43:26,720
They're probably done and don't call me surely

5616
06:43:28,320 --> 06:43:33,760
Do you have a checklist? No, I'm just following the reeflings. I trust the reeflings blindly with my life

5617
06:43:34,720 --> 06:43:37,920
And in exchange they get milked. It's quite a good uh

5618
06:43:39,280 --> 06:43:42,960
Um relationship honestly, I mean, I think

5619
06:43:47,920 --> 06:43:49,920
They're so beautiful

5620
06:43:50,400 --> 06:43:54,000
Look, I succeeded in growing an orange bloom. Thanks for your help. I'm so grateful

5621
06:43:54,800 --> 06:44:00,320
I'm taking a break from research, but I've lots of good ideas super hyper cyber. Which one should I pick first?

5622

Give me the goods give me the goods. Come on surely you want to give me something for it? Come on

5623

What did that do

5624
06:44:20,400 --> 06:44:25,280
Did I walk something doing that or do we just have pretty flowers now? Honestly, I ain't that mad

5625
06:44:26,160 --> 06:44:30,240
I ain't that mad. They're they're pretty cute scammed. No, honestly, they're pretty cute

5626
06:44:34,480 --> 06:44:36,480

06:46:38,160 --> 06:46:40,160
No one wants to link them

5651
06:46:42,400 --> 06:46:44,400
Uh

5652
06:46:46,080 --> 06:46:50,720
There is a game where you can dodge the bird if you want I always remember things not funny again

5653
06:46:51,920 --> 06:46:53,920
Oh, it's the library

5654
06:46:54,000 --> 06:46:56,560
Did you jump in the bell? I did jump in the bell

5655
06:46:57,760 --> 06:46:59,760
I'm gonna unlock the next edition

5656
06:47:01,280 --> 06:47:04,720
Welcome. Yes. Yes. Yes. I've almost finished

5657
06:47:06,080 --> 06:47:10,240
Right, we'll go bottom left. No, no, I didn't mean it but thanks. Oh, I appreciate it

5658
06:47:10,880 --> 06:47:17,920
Um, we'll go bottom left and the reason for that is because there was a few dig sites we unlocked

5659
06:47:19,760 --> 06:47:22,480
Uh, there's a up here

5660
06:47:26,080 --> 06:47:28,240
Man, just let me cut the grass in peace. Okay

5661
06:47:29,680 --> 06:47:36,320
Some of us need to to feed their gacha habit and if I'm going to fund it by cutting grass then just leave me to it

5662
06:47:36,320 --> 06:47:39,360
Okay. Oh, there we go. That's what we'll see. Wee

5663
06:47:40,880 --> 06:47:42,880
Okay

5664
06:47:44,480 --> 06:47:46,480
All right fallen trees

5665
06:47:48,160 --> 06:47:50,160
All right, this one's

5666
06:47:51,680 --> 06:47:53,680
Wow

5667
06:47:54,240 --> 06:47:56,240
Soon soon

5668
06:47:56,320 --> 06:47:59,840
Wait, that was a swamp. That was the guy's house

5669
06:48:02,560 --> 06:48:07,040
And then this one did we dig up we might have already done that

5670
06:48:07,760 --> 06:48:12,960
A bomb place. How do you guys spot the bomb places so easily?

5671
06:48:14,480 --> 06:48:16,480
A bomb place

5672
06:48:17,520 --> 06:48:19,520
Oops, a bomb place

5673
06:48:20,320 --> 06:48:22,320
That's here

5674
06:48:25,680 --> 06:48:27,680
A bomb place

5675
06:48:27,680 --> 06:48:38,960
Can you be this zero in a bit? I've already been in here

5676
06:48:44,080 --> 06:48:46,080
Nope to the right

5677
06:48:50,720 --> 06:48:52,720
Aww

5678
06:48:53,440 --> 06:48:55,440
Oh

5679
06:48:58,000 --> 06:49:01,040
Get in the bowl, hen. Thank you

5680
06:49:04,640 --> 06:49:08,240
She's me just going for a dip plus I watch you lovely ladies flutter about

5681
06:49:11,680 --> 06:49:15,440
I still don't get how you guys see that honestly. I would never have caught that

5682
06:49:16,960 --> 06:49:18,960
Um

5683
06:49:18,960 --> 06:49:44,960
We can dig this up, nice, nice, huge, is that everything for the sweet region here?

5684
06:49:45,960 --> 06:49:46,960
It was?

5685
06:49:47,960 --> 06:49:48,960
Oops, sorry.

5686
06:49:49,960 --> 06:49:51,960
Is that literally everything I've unlocked?

5687
06:49:51,960 --> 06:49:55,960
I just need to fuse stones with people, but I don't know where they're located, basically.

5688
06:49:58,960 --> 06:50:00,960
Hold on, just checking.

5689
06:50:01,960 --> 06:50:06,960
Right, I need to finish the post office, and I need to talk to that wife and get a charm off of her.

5690
06:50:06,960 --> 06:50:10,960
I need to finish the gacha, which I'm literally about to do.

5691
06:50:10,960 --> 06:50:15,960
I've not finished off the gorom, which is a shame.

5692
06:50:16,960 --> 06:50:18,960
The lake, apparently, is finished off.

5693
06:50:24,960 --> 06:50:29,960
Bro, I'm just shite, as it clearly is.

5694
06:50:31,960 --> 06:50:34,960
Is there any mythical features in Foch Foch, or tons?

5695
06:50:34,960 --> 06:50:36,960
Kelpies are probably the most well-known.

5696
06:50:37,960 --> 06:50:38,960
Um...

5697
06:50:41,960 --> 06:50:46,960
Kelpies are horses that convince you to ride their back, and then you drown.

5698
06:50:46,960 --> 06:50:48,960
So basically, like, marry me.

5699
06:50:49,960 --> 06:50:50,960
Um...

5700
06:50:51,960 --> 06:50:53,960
Right, we have 300 rupees.

5701
06:50:53,960 --> 06:50:57,960
Let's go talk to this wife, and let's go get the latest issue.

5702
06:50:58,960 --> 06:51:00,960
We've got one more?

5703
06:51:00,960 --> 06:51:02,960
Hello, we've got a new issue, yes?

5704
06:51:02,960 --> 06:51:04,960
Yes, thank you, I would like it.

5705
06:51:07,960 --> 06:51:14,960
Um, right, we're actually going to purposefully fail a gacha, so we can make 10 rupees.

5706
06:51:14,960 --> 06:51:18,960
I've got 190, and it's 200 for an addition.

5707
06:51:18,960 --> 06:51:20,960
So we're going to purposefully fail this, okay?

5708
06:51:22,960 --> 06:51:25,960
We're going to purposefully fail this, please don't worry.

5709
06:51:25,960 --> 06:51:27,960
It is all by design.

5710
06:51:28,960 --> 06:51:31,960
The difference is Kelpies eat you after you drown.

5711
06:51:31,960 --> 06:51:33,960
Marry me to do that too.

5712
06:51:33,960 --> 06:51:34,960
Yeah, that's fine.

5713
06:51:34,960 --> 06:51:35,960
Okay, yes, yes, yes.

5714
06:51:35,960 --> 06:51:38,960
Okay, we need one, we just need to fail one more.

5715
06:51:38,960 --> 06:51:41,960
And before I win it, could you imagine?

5716
06:51:41,960 --> 06:51:44,960
I curse you with good luck, 3% probability.

5717
06:51:45,960 --> 06:51:47,960
That would be blessed.

5718
06:51:50,960 --> 06:51:54,960
You raid their back and they drown you, basically.

5719
06:51:54,960 --> 06:51:58,960
So Kelpies are like, marry me to drown you in water.

5720
06:52:00,960 --> 06:52:01,960
How many shells, right?

5721
06:52:01,960 --> 06:52:03,960
Let's get to work.

5722
06:52:05,960 --> 06:52:11,960
It's a hippocampus, so it murders in time.

5723
06:52:11,960 --> 06:52:15,960
Name to eat shells to get one correct gacha.

5724
06:52:17,960 --> 06:52:20,960
The classic red cap goblin is also a Scottish myth.

5725
06:52:22,960 --> 06:52:25,960
Big blue choo-choo appears in the temple of the droplet.

5726
06:52:25,960 --> 06:52:28,960
It's an ordinary blue choo-choo, faking him, minnish sizes, daunting.

5727
06:52:28,960 --> 06:52:30,960
Just try to avoid the electric.

5728
06:52:31,960 --> 06:52:36,960
Congrats, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime.

5729
06:52:37,960 --> 06:52:38,960
Wanna try again?

5730
06:52:38,960 --> 06:52:41,960
Yes, I think I have enough, question mark.

5731
06:52:48,960 --> 06:52:49,960
We do have enough.

5732
06:52:50,960 --> 06:52:52,960
Yes, name to eat, give me that little lever.

5733
06:52:54,960 --> 06:52:56,960
Kelpies are squashful.

5734
06:52:57,960 --> 06:53:01,960
King Daltas.

5735
06:53:02,960 --> 06:53:05,960
Congratulations, I'll keep the figurine in case you can see it anytime.

5736
06:53:05,960 --> 06:53:06,960
Do we have enough?

5737
06:53:06,960 --> 06:53:08,960
We do have enough for another roll.

5738
06:53:08,960 --> 06:53:09,960
Wanna try again?

5739
06:53:09,960 --> 06:53:11,960
I absolutely would love to.

5740
06:53:11,960 --> 06:53:12,960
Yes, please.

5741
06:53:12,960 --> 06:53:13,960
Oh, no.

5742
06:53:13,960 --> 06:53:14,960
Oh, well.

5743
06:53:14,960 --> 06:53:16,960
Okay, 2% gacha.

5744
06:53:16,960 --> 06:53:18,960
Wish us luck.

5745
06:53:18,960 --> 06:53:20,960
2% gacha.

5746
06:53:21,960 --> 06:53:23,960
Yeah, surprise, surprise.

5747
06:53:23,960 --> 06:53:25,960
Yeah, I don't think so.

5748
06:53:25,960 --> 06:53:29,960
I think there's legit like 4 missing.

5749
06:53:30,960 --> 06:53:32,960
1, 2, 3.

5750
06:53:46,960 --> 06:53:48,960
3, wow.

5751
06:53:48,960 --> 06:53:50,960
Okay, 3 more.

5752
06:53:51,960 --> 06:53:54,960
2% is better odds than a gacha 5 star.

5753
06:53:56,960 --> 06:53:59,960
Well, after this, it's literally 2 more and we're done.

5754
06:53:59,960 --> 06:54:00,960
We are done with gacha.

5755
06:54:00,960 --> 06:54:03,960
We can finally access that room.

5756
06:54:07,960 --> 06:54:10,960
The third last one is...

5757
06:54:11,960 --> 06:54:13,960
Aw, Ren's sleep.

5758
06:54:13,960 --> 06:54:14,960
Ren's shoe shop.

5759
06:54:14,960 --> 06:54:16,960
Using a secret technique, he makes shoes in his sleep.

5760
06:54:16,960 --> 06:54:18,960
Princess Zelda is his thing.

5761
06:54:18,960 --> 06:54:21,960
His biggest source of income.

5762
06:54:21,960 --> 06:54:22,960
That's cute.

5763
06:54:22,960 --> 06:54:23,960
Okay.

5764
06:54:23,960 --> 06:54:28,960
We are out of shells so we can't do it again until we get a few more.

5765
06:54:28,960 --> 06:54:31,960
But literally 2 more to go feels good, man.

5766
06:54:34,960 --> 06:54:36,960
Oh, hello, Popper.

5767
06:54:36,960 --> 06:54:37,960
You're in the way.

5768
06:54:37,960 --> 06:54:38,960
In the way.

5769
06:54:38,960 --> 06:54:39,960
Yeah.

5770
06:54:39,960 --> 06:54:40,960
Nope, you're straight back in the way.

5771
06:54:40,960 --> 06:54:41,960
Yep, there you go.

5772
06:54:42,960 --> 06:54:43,960
Oh, wait.

5773
06:54:43,960 --> 06:54:46,960
We're gonna talk to her so she gives us her blessing thing

5774
06:54:46,960 --> 06:54:48,960
because she does...

5775
06:54:48,960 --> 06:54:49,960
Yes.

5776
06:54:51,960 --> 06:54:55,960
We're just gonna use that so she can give me the charm.

5777
06:54:56,960 --> 06:54:57,960
What does it do?

5778
06:54:58,960 --> 06:55:00,960
Blue Link can't hurt you.

5779
06:55:00,960 --> 06:55:02,960
He isn't real Blue Link.

5780
06:55:03,960 --> 06:55:04,960
That is cursed.

5781
06:55:05,960 --> 06:55:08,960
And last but not least, yes, give me it.

5782
06:55:08,960 --> 06:55:10,960
And then that's fully gone.

5783
06:55:13,960 --> 06:55:14,960
All done.

5784
06:55:14,960 --> 06:55:15,960
What do you see now?

5785
06:55:15,960 --> 06:55:17,960
You now have the full collection of layers,

5786
06:55:17,960 --> 06:55:20,960
but I guess you must know all kinds of stuff now, huh, Professor?

5787
06:55:21,960 --> 06:55:22,960
Are you flirting with me?

5788
06:55:22,960 --> 06:55:23,960
I will...

5789
06:55:24,960 --> 06:55:26,960
I will perish right now.

5790
06:55:28,960 --> 06:55:29,960
Let's see.

5791
06:55:32,960 --> 06:55:34,960
No one...

5792
06:55:36,960 --> 06:55:40,960
No one wants to link our cheeky stones.

5793
06:55:40,960 --> 06:55:43,960
I'm really struggling to find anyone who wants to do it.

5794
06:55:45,960 --> 06:55:46,960
Read.

5795
06:55:46,960 --> 06:55:48,960
Do you want me to read?

5796
06:55:49,960 --> 06:55:51,960
Oh, I'll go and take another one.

5797
06:55:56,960 --> 06:55:58,960
Purple Burglar Alarm Link.

5798
06:56:00,960 --> 06:56:02,960
No, you don't want to trade either.

5799
06:56:06,960 --> 06:56:10,960
You still need to buy the Goron...

5800
06:56:16,960 --> 06:56:17,960
What?

5801
06:56:19,960 --> 06:56:21,960
Did I really have nowhere else to go?

5802
06:56:23,960 --> 06:56:26,960
I don't know if I should just go back to that field and farm it,

5803
06:56:26,960 --> 06:56:28,960
that one that's like to the west.

5804
06:56:29,960 --> 06:56:32,960
Did you dock with the Minish in the bookshelf?

5805
06:56:33,960 --> 06:56:34,960
I think so.

5806
06:56:35,960 --> 06:56:37,960
I'll just go back to make sure.

5807
06:56:37,960 --> 06:56:38,960
Make sure.

5808
06:56:43,960 --> 06:56:46,960
I've seen games with a 1 in 15,000 drop.

5809
06:56:46,960 --> 06:56:49,960
See, that just like completely turns me off.

5810
06:56:49,960 --> 06:56:52,960
I'm like, well, I'm without lucky, so what's the point?

5811
06:56:52,960 --> 06:56:54,960
I wouldn't even spend my pennies on it.

5812
06:56:54,960 --> 06:56:56,960
I'll see if there's any we Minish.

5813
06:56:56,960 --> 06:56:58,960
Actually, I do need to go back to the mining village

5814
06:56:58,960 --> 06:57:03,960
because I think there possibly had been someone that might want to...

5815
06:57:03,960 --> 06:57:06,960
Oh, there's a wee guy up there, maybe he wants to...

5816
06:57:07,960 --> 06:57:08,960
You're still playing this.

5817
06:57:09,960 --> 06:57:10,960
I went to bed when you started.

5818
06:57:10,960 --> 06:57:12,960
Well, you must have got a terrible sleep.

5819
06:57:12,960 --> 06:57:14,960
There's only been seven hours, you need eight.

5820
06:57:16,960 --> 06:57:18,960
Okay, we'll go back.

5821
06:57:18,960 --> 06:57:20,960
We'll go back to the mines after this.

5822
06:57:20,960 --> 06:57:22,960
The children yearn for the mines.

5823
06:57:31,960 --> 06:57:32,960
I did have a terrible sleep.

5824
06:57:32,960 --> 06:57:33,960
Exactly, see?

5825
06:57:34,960 --> 06:57:37,960
Reminds me of how I thought I could get the woodcutting pen.

5826
06:57:41,960 --> 06:57:43,960
Oh, so you passed the trial and returned.

5827
06:57:43,960 --> 06:57:44,960
I'm so jealous.

5828
06:57:44,960 --> 06:57:46,960
But if you're going on an adventure,

5829
06:57:46,960 --> 06:57:48,960
there's no one better to learn for the elder.

5830
06:57:48,960 --> 06:57:51,960
He's so manly, so rivally, and so full of fire.

5831
06:57:53,960 --> 06:57:54,960
Oh, it's green though.

5832
06:57:55,960 --> 06:57:59,960
It's not very important if it's green, unless I'm mistaken.

5833
06:58:00,960 --> 06:58:02,960
Oh, I'm not back at the swamp.

5834
06:58:02,960 --> 06:58:05,960
Come on, have you never been to the swamp so many times?

5835
06:58:05,960 --> 06:58:07,960
No, it's just for jewelry.

5836
06:58:08,960 --> 06:58:09,960
Jewelry for gems.

5837
06:58:11,960 --> 06:58:12,960
Well done indeed.

5838
06:58:12,960 --> 06:58:14,960
You're almost as surprised as I was at your age.

5839
06:58:16,960 --> 06:58:17,960
How about again?

5840
06:58:17,960 --> 06:58:18,960
No?

5841
06:58:21,960 --> 06:58:24,960
No, I can only do it once and it was green.

5842
06:58:24,960 --> 06:58:26,960
I wasn't even an important one.

5843
06:58:27,960 --> 06:58:29,960
Get out of my swamp.

5844
06:58:29,960 --> 06:58:31,960
I mean, honestly, we're what?

5845
06:58:31,960 --> 06:58:33,960
Missing three heart containers?

5846
06:58:34,960 --> 06:58:35,960
That's not that bad.

5847
06:58:35,960 --> 06:58:36,960
It could be way worse.

5848
06:58:39,960 --> 06:58:41,960
I feel like three heart containers is pretty good.

5849
06:58:41,960 --> 06:58:43,960
I actually have no clue what I'm missing, but...

5850
06:58:46,960 --> 06:58:47,960
Maybe.

5851
06:58:48,960 --> 06:58:50,960
Just maybe we do the boss.

5852
06:58:50,960 --> 06:58:51,960
Because when does Mercy come on?

5853
06:58:51,960 --> 06:58:54,960
We've got T minus two hours for Mercy, so...

5854
06:58:57,960 --> 06:58:59,960
I will get the last gacha, though.

5855
06:58:59,960 --> 06:59:01,960
I want to do the gacha part.

5856
06:59:01,960 --> 06:59:03,960
Addicted, I know.

5857
06:59:03,960 --> 06:59:06,960
I'm gonna cut grass for the gacha.

5858
06:59:07,960 --> 06:59:09,960
I can't believe I'm saying this one.

5859
06:59:09,960 --> 06:59:11,960
I'm a way to cut grass for gacha.

5860
06:59:20,960 --> 06:59:22,960
Oh my god, that's when you know it's bad.

5861
06:59:22,960 --> 06:59:24,960
Start doing manual labor.

5862
06:59:27,960 --> 06:59:28,960
Terrible.

5863
06:59:28,960 --> 06:59:30,960
They're not dropping anything.

5864
06:59:33,960 --> 06:59:35,960
As if he hits me.

5865
06:59:38,960 --> 06:59:40,960
See, these guys are so in awe.

5866
06:59:40,960 --> 06:59:42,960
Go and just perish me.

5867
06:59:44,960 --> 06:59:47,960
I need 200 coins to buy 30 more.

5868
06:59:52,960 --> 06:59:55,960
This is gonna take forever this way.

5869
06:59:56,960 --> 06:59:59,960
Why didn't you get the rest of the red rupees at the bean?

5870
06:59:59,960 --> 07:00:01,960
Oh, I don't know where that bean is.

5871
07:00:01,960 --> 07:00:05,960
My inventory was full, so I didn't want to pick up anymore.

5872
07:00:11,960 --> 07:00:13,960
Me wallet was full.

5873
07:00:13,960 --> 07:00:14,960
Can't believe it.

5874
07:00:15,960 --> 07:00:16,960
I'm at 41.

5875
07:00:16,960 --> 07:00:19,960
This is gonna take forever cutting grass.

5876
07:00:19,960 --> 07:00:21,960
Was it this one?

5877
07:00:21,960 --> 07:00:24,960
If it was, that's incredibly lucky.

5878
07:00:27,960 --> 07:00:30,960
Oh, I'm beating them up.

5879
07:00:34,960 --> 07:00:37,960
If it was this one, then...

5880
07:00:37,960 --> 07:00:39,960
How much do I need?

5881
07:00:39,960 --> 07:00:40,960
Shell.

5882
07:00:40,960 --> 07:00:43,960
Oh, I need quite a few more to be honest.

5883
07:00:43,960 --> 07:00:46,960
Oh wow, I just cut that arrow in the air.

5884
07:00:51,960 --> 07:00:55,960
I wonder how much time on my life I spent cutting grass and Zelda.

5885
07:00:56,960 --> 07:00:58,960
Link gets the job cutting grass.

5886
07:00:58,960 --> 07:01:01,960
Okay, that'll help out quite a bit.

5887
07:01:01,960 --> 07:01:04,960
That was, we've got 230 rupees now,

5888
07:01:04,960 --> 07:01:10,960
which means we can buy 30 more so we can get the second last ketchup.

5889
07:01:10,960 --> 07:01:14,960
Or we could just keep farming to be honest.

5890
07:01:14,960 --> 07:01:17,960
I don't know, I think we're gonna have to farm for this.

5891
07:01:17,960 --> 07:01:19,960
Is that a special?

5892
07:01:19,960 --> 07:01:20,960
Has it got fairy in it?

5893
07:01:20,960 --> 07:01:22,960
Yep, it was special.

5894
07:01:22,960 --> 07:01:23,960
See?

5895
07:01:25,960 --> 07:01:26,960
Ow.

5896
07:01:33,960 --> 07:01:34,960
Did I do this right?

5897
07:01:34,960 --> 07:01:37,960
That other one gave me six coins in one go.

5898
07:01:41,960 --> 07:01:42,960
Drapped.

5899
07:01:44,960 --> 07:01:47,960
Remember catching chickens give shells on money?

5900
07:01:47,960 --> 07:01:49,960
Oh no!

5901
07:01:50,960 --> 07:01:52,960
My biggest enemy.

5902
07:01:53,960 --> 07:01:55,960
Like, for real, for real though.

5903
07:01:55,960 --> 07:01:57,960
Is there something here I've yet to do?

5904
07:01:57,960 --> 07:01:58,960
Or did I already do that?

5905
07:01:58,960 --> 07:02:00,960
I already did it.

5906
07:02:06,960 --> 07:02:09,960
Did you check the orange people flowers?

5907
07:02:09,960 --> 07:02:10,960
Where?

5908
07:02:10,960 --> 07:02:14,960
I checked up on the guy, but he never did me anything.

5909
07:02:19,960 --> 07:02:21,960
I'll see how hard these chickens are.

5910
07:02:21,960 --> 07:02:24,960
Maybe, maybe I can't believe I'm saying this,

5911
07:02:24,960 --> 07:02:27,960
but maybe it's worthwhile to go run around and look after chickens.

5912
07:02:27,960 --> 07:02:28,960
What's that, 90?

5913
07:02:28,960 --> 07:02:30,960
I think that's about 400%.

5914
07:02:35,960 --> 07:02:38,960
Second last figure, we can do it.

5915
07:02:38,960 --> 07:02:39,960
Second last.

5916
07:02:40,960 --> 07:02:42,960
What's it gonna be?

5917
07:02:42,960 --> 07:02:43,960
Oh, you're back.

5918
07:02:43,960 --> 07:02:44,960
I am back.

5919
07:02:44,960 --> 07:02:46,960
And I'm addicted.

5920
07:02:47,960 --> 07:02:49,960
Probability is one.

5921
07:02:51,960 --> 07:02:52,960
One.

5922
07:02:55,960 --> 07:02:58,960
Wait, so am I gonna have a move for 100% guarantee?

5923
07:03:03,960 --> 07:03:05,960
I don't have enough to put 100 shells in.

5924
07:03:05,960 --> 07:03:08,960
I am not risking it, sauce, but...

5925
07:03:08,960 --> 07:03:11,960
Oh my god, I can't even get rid of it!

5926
07:03:11,960 --> 07:03:14,960
No, I'm sorry, I am not risking all those shells

5927
07:03:14,960 --> 07:03:17,960
just to get it, just to not get it.

5928
07:03:17,960 --> 07:03:18,960
Roll them bones, no.

5929
07:03:18,960 --> 07:03:21,960
You guys have no idea how unlucky I am.

5930
07:03:21,960 --> 07:03:24,960
Did you not watch the Buckshot Relay Stream?

5931
07:03:24,960 --> 07:03:28,960
Where I lost on the tutorial twice or something?

5932
07:03:28,960 --> 07:03:30,960
So we can clip it if it goes wrong.

5933
07:03:30,960 --> 07:03:33,960
No, I am not that brave.

5934
07:03:33,960 --> 07:03:35,960
I literally, I lost.

5935
07:03:35,960 --> 07:03:37,960
We never lose.

5936
07:03:37,960 --> 07:03:39,960
All gambas quit.

5937
07:03:39,960 --> 07:03:41,960
Right, I can't believe I'm saying this,

5938
07:03:41,960 --> 07:03:43,960
but we're gonna give the chicken a try.

5939
07:03:45,960 --> 07:03:48,960
See if that'll give us the money we're looking for.

5940
07:03:48,960 --> 07:03:49,960
Hi.

5941
07:03:50,960 --> 07:03:52,960
Sure, what do you want?

5942
07:03:53,960 --> 07:03:57,960
These are the ones that are halfway across the map.

5943
07:03:58,960 --> 07:04:01,960
No, I'm not playing in your stupid chicken game.

5944
07:04:01,960 --> 07:04:03,960
Fuck you, I'm going to the swamp, where is it?

5945
07:04:03,960 --> 07:04:04,960
Down.

5946
07:04:04,960 --> 07:04:06,960
No, oh, no, down.

5947
07:04:06,960 --> 07:04:10,960
No, I am not, I'm not playing in your chicken games

5948
07:04:10,960 --> 07:04:12,960
where they're halfway across the map.

5949
07:04:13,960 --> 07:04:16,960
I'm going to the swamp and there's nothing you can do about it.

5950
07:04:16,960 --> 07:04:19,960
Swamp to kill this little golden goose thing.

5951
07:04:22,960 --> 07:04:25,960
Where was it? Was it down here?

5952
07:04:26,960 --> 07:04:28,960
What is that?

5953
07:04:30,960 --> 07:04:33,960
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

5954
07:04:33,960 --> 07:04:36,960
I'm actually really bad at that, I don't know.

5955
07:04:38,960 --> 07:04:40,960
Can I go down that pool?

5956
07:04:41,960 --> 07:04:43,960
What do you want to do?

5957
07:04:44,960 --> 07:04:45,960
Ow.

5958
07:04:49,960 --> 07:04:51,960
Oh, well, yeah, you're right, I could have gone to that one,

5959
07:04:51,960 --> 07:04:53,960
that would have been a lot quicker.

5960
07:04:53,960 --> 07:04:55,960
But we're here, we're here, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

5961
07:04:55,960 --> 07:04:58,960
Look, it's about the journey, it's about the experience

5962
07:04:58,960 --> 07:05:01,960
we made along the way, the experience we made losing our health.

5963
07:05:01,960 --> 07:05:03,960
Row, wake up.

5964
07:05:05,960 --> 07:05:06,960
Wake up.

5965
07:05:07,960 --> 07:05:08,960
Wake up.

5966
07:05:12,960 --> 07:05:15,960
Prepping slow cooked stew while watching strongly.

5967
07:05:15,960 --> 07:05:16,960
Good girl, man.

5968
07:05:16,960 --> 07:05:18,960
Oh, that's what you did.

5969
07:05:18,960 --> 07:05:20,960
Oh wait, did I go in here?

5970
07:05:20,960 --> 07:05:23,960
Is this new or am I just making it up?

5971
07:05:23,960 --> 07:05:25,960
Have I been in you before?

5972
07:05:25,960 --> 07:05:27,960
I have, because I've already...

5973
07:05:27,960 --> 07:05:31,960
I can trade, I can trade, please take it, take my stone.

5974
07:05:32,960 --> 07:05:36,960
It's been so long, four minutes.

5975
07:05:36,960 --> 07:05:39,960
You're beanstalk as well.

5976
07:05:39,960 --> 07:05:41,960
We're in the money, boys, we're in the money.

5977
07:05:41,960 --> 07:05:46,960
Beanstalk as well as Golden's thingy, my Bobber.

5978
07:05:49,960 --> 07:05:51,960
Oh, and I'm like two centimeters away from it.

5979
07:05:51,960 --> 07:05:53,960
Oh my god, you're such a good boy, little Minish thing.

5980
07:05:53,960 --> 07:05:55,960
Hold on, have you got another trade for me?

5981
07:05:56,960 --> 07:05:58,960
You don't, but that's fine, we're gonna go to the Minish mines.

5982
07:05:58,960 --> 07:06:00,960
I keep forgetting to go to the Minish mines.

5983
07:06:01,960 --> 07:06:03,960
Oh my god, we're doing it.

5984
07:06:03,960 --> 07:06:04,960
We're doing it, I can do it.

5985
07:06:04,960 --> 07:06:06,960
Shawnee's just gonna try and fill two more,

5986
07:06:06,960 --> 07:06:07,960
so we're perfect, right?

5987
07:06:07,960 --> 07:06:09,960
I've not even killed the main boss yet.

5988
07:06:09,960 --> 07:06:11,960
I've not even done the boss fight.

5989
07:06:11,960 --> 07:06:13,960
I'm too busy like getting distracted,

5990
07:06:13,960 --> 07:06:15,960
like doing all these wee side things.

5991
07:06:15,960 --> 07:06:17,960
I was gonna try and a hundred percent it,

5992
07:06:17,960 --> 07:06:19,960
but I have no idea what I'm missing,

5993
07:06:19,960 --> 07:06:21,960
like I'm not smart enough.

5994
07:06:22,960 --> 07:06:24,960
Clean, clean, clean, clean.

5995
07:06:24,960 --> 07:06:26,960
I'm climbing, I'm climbing.

5996
07:06:26,960 --> 07:06:28,960
Oh!

5997
07:06:29,960 --> 07:06:31,960
You got large quiver!

5998
07:06:31,960 --> 07:06:34,960
So we can hold 90, oh, 90 bombs, 90 now.

5999
07:06:34,960 --> 07:06:36,960
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll take it, I'll take it.

6000
07:06:37,960 --> 07:06:39,960
Did that thing get away down again?

6001
07:06:39,960 --> 07:06:40,960
That's fine.

6002
07:06:42,960 --> 07:06:44,960
Copium telecom is doing.

6003
07:06:45,960 --> 07:06:47,960
Right, let's go get that sneak,

6004
07:06:47,960 --> 07:06:50,960
and then we can finally a hundred percent our gacha pawn.

6005
07:06:51,960 --> 07:06:53,960
I like how the sneak just let me beat them up earlier,

6006
07:06:53,960 --> 07:06:55,960
and now that's fine.

6007
07:06:58,960 --> 07:07:00,960
Right, I actually...

6008
07:07:01,960 --> 07:07:03,960
Oh wait, there's a freaking short cut right here

6009
07:07:03,960 --> 07:07:05,960
that I walked right past.

6010
07:07:05,960 --> 07:07:07,960
Cutting the grass.

6011
07:07:07,960 --> 07:07:08,960
Cut the grass.

6012
07:07:08,960 --> 07:07:10,960
Can't wait to play grass cut or similiar.

6013
07:07:12,960 --> 07:07:15,960
I'm actually surprised the power washer doves

6014
07:07:15,960 --> 07:07:17,960
aren't coming out with some stuff.

6015
07:07:17,960 --> 07:07:19,960
I'm pretty sure you can't activate them

6016
07:07:19,960 --> 07:07:21,960
or hurt them from behind.

6017
07:07:23,960 --> 07:07:25,960
We need to not upset them.

6018
07:07:25,960 --> 07:07:28,960
I mean, did you get oiled up for the clap audio?

6019
07:07:30,960 --> 07:07:33,960
Yeah, you can hear me put it on, actually.

6020
07:07:33,960 --> 07:07:36,960
You can hear me take off the apparel

6021
07:07:36,960 --> 07:07:38,960
and put on the...

6022
07:07:40,960 --> 07:07:42,960
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

6023
07:07:42,960 --> 07:07:44,960
And...

6024
07:07:44,960 --> 07:07:46,960
Put on...

6025
07:07:48,960 --> 07:07:51,960
I've taken a while to make the power wash on that.

6026
07:07:55,960 --> 07:07:57,960
It's a battle of the laser beam!

6027
07:08:00,960 --> 07:08:02,960
Oh, I love the laser beam.

6028
07:08:03,960 --> 07:08:05,960
Did I unlock something else here?

6029
07:08:05,960 --> 07:08:07,960
I have a feeling I unlocked something else here.

6030
07:08:08,960 --> 07:08:10,960
I didn't.

6031
07:08:12,960 --> 07:08:14,960
Okay, I love this laser beam.

6032
07:08:14,960 --> 07:08:16,960
Stay with me all the time.

6033
07:08:17,960 --> 07:08:18,960
That's what I want to see.

6034
07:08:18,960 --> 07:08:19,960
That's what I want to see.

6035
07:08:19,960 --> 07:08:21,960
Right, how much money?

6036
07:08:21,960 --> 07:08:23,960
Oh, I'm only 150.

6037
07:08:26,960 --> 07:08:28,960
Is that supposed to do something else?

6038
07:08:28,960 --> 07:08:29,960
Where does it come from?

6039
07:08:29,960 --> 07:08:31,960
Maybe...

6040
07:08:32,960 --> 07:08:34,960
Maybe...

6041
07:08:34,960 --> 07:08:36,960
something?

6042
07:08:37,960 --> 07:08:40,960
Should I be giving chat a large cover right now?

6043
07:08:40,960 --> 07:08:42,960
That was so good.

6044
07:08:42,960 --> 07:08:44,960
Well, it's getting uploaded first, right then.

6045
07:08:45,960 --> 07:08:48,960
I think I'll tame it to come on...

6046
07:08:48,960 --> 07:08:50,960
to go live, like, an hour before AC,

6047
07:08:50,960 --> 07:08:52,960
because I don't want it to, like...

6048
07:08:52,960 --> 07:08:54,960
It's not going to disrupt AC's stream,

6049
07:08:54,960 --> 07:08:55,960
but...

6050
07:08:55,960 --> 07:08:57,960
I mean, you didn't even want to...

6051
07:08:57,960 --> 07:08:59,960
I don't want to, like...

6052
07:09:00,960 --> 07:09:02,960
Obviously...

6053
07:09:02,960 --> 07:09:04,960
Yeah, I'm trying to pick more words.

6054
07:09:04,960 --> 07:09:05,960
I don't want to be, like...

6055
07:09:05,960 --> 07:09:07,960
I don't want to steamroll over my gen mates.

6056
07:09:07,960 --> 07:09:09,960
Also me, who streams for 12 hours,

6057
07:09:09,960 --> 07:09:11,960
so it's kind of unavoidable.

6058
07:09:15,960 --> 07:09:18,960
The last few heart pieces are actually in the dungeon.

6059
07:09:18,960 --> 07:09:19,960
Oh, okay.

6060
07:09:19,960 --> 07:09:20,960
Yeah, that was fine.

6061
07:09:25,960 --> 07:09:28,960
Was that supposed to do something with the orange guy,

6062
07:09:28,960 --> 07:09:30,960
or am I being trolled?

6063
07:09:35,960 --> 07:09:40,960
I think I'll just have to go farming in that field.

6064
07:09:40,960 --> 07:09:42,960
The orange flower guy?

6065
07:09:42,960 --> 07:09:44,960
Someone mentioned it again, and I'm like,

6066
07:09:44,960 --> 07:09:46,960
are you trolling me, or is there actually

6067
07:09:46,960 --> 07:09:48,960
something with that orange flower guy?

6068
07:09:50,960 --> 07:09:52,960
Did you say he was in town or not?

6069
07:09:52,960 --> 07:09:53,960
I don't...

6070
07:10:01,960 --> 07:10:03,960
Someone said...

6071
07:10:03,960 --> 07:10:05,960
Is it Beel?

6072
07:10:08,960 --> 07:10:09,960
Him?

6073
07:10:09,960 --> 07:10:11,960
Why hello there, thanks for coming by.

6074
07:10:11,960 --> 07:10:13,960
I start playing the theme.

6075
07:10:14,960 --> 07:10:16,960
No, I think I'm mistaken.

6076
07:10:16,960 --> 07:10:17,960
Right, this is the Gambo, man.

6077
07:10:17,960 --> 07:10:19,960
I'm not sure I want a Gambo, to be honest.

6078
07:10:20,960 --> 07:10:22,960
Beel sells...

6079
07:10:22,960 --> 07:10:24,960
Who's Beeto?

6080
07:10:24,960 --> 07:10:26,960
That guy, the guy I just spoke to.

6081
07:10:30,960 --> 07:10:32,960
The veggie man?

6082
07:10:36,960 --> 07:10:38,960
Click on the jar.

6083
07:10:43,960 --> 07:10:45,960
Why hello there, that is the weight

6084
07:10:45,960 --> 07:10:47,960
for people who want to get lucky.

6085
07:10:48,960 --> 07:10:50,960
Oh...

6086
07:10:50,960 --> 07:10:52,960
Okay, that's actually...

6087
07:10:52,960 --> 07:10:54,960
No, I did not have the money for that,

6088
07:10:54,960 --> 07:10:56,960
but thank you anyway for asking.

6089
07:10:59,960 --> 07:11:01,960
Okay, have you played Brit...

6090
07:11:01,960 --> 07:11:03,960
No, this is my only legend Zolda game.

6091
07:11:03,960 --> 07:11:05,960
I have not had any Zolda experience

6092
07:11:05,960 --> 07:11:07,960
other than this game.

6093
07:11:08,960 --> 07:11:10,960
Right, give me the money for cutting the grass

6094
07:11:10,960 --> 07:11:11,960
right now.

6095
07:11:11,960 --> 07:11:13,960
Hand over the money and no one gets hurt.

6096
07:11:13,960 --> 07:11:15,960
Did I make myself clear video game?

6097
07:11:17,960 --> 07:11:19,960
Check out all his other ones too.

6098
07:11:21,960 --> 07:11:23,960
Wind Walker.

6099
07:11:23,960 --> 07:11:25,960
Wah, he wants to trade.

6100
07:11:25,960 --> 07:11:27,960
I saw that, I saw that, he wants to trade.

6101
07:11:27,960 --> 07:11:29,960
I knew you would want to do it.

6102
07:11:29,960 --> 07:11:31,960
I knew it, I knew it.

6103
07:11:31,960 --> 07:11:33,960
I knew it, what do you want?

6104
07:11:33,960 --> 07:11:35,960
Please be a treasure chest, so I can get money

6105
07:11:35,960 --> 07:11:37,960
for easy peasy land and squeezing.

6106
07:11:37,960 --> 07:11:39,960
There's one for shells, is there?

6107
07:11:39,960 --> 07:11:41,960
I don't know where that is.

6108
07:11:41,960 --> 07:11:43,960
That's super easy to get to.

6109
07:11:43,960 --> 07:11:45,960
Right, we're heading straight for it.

6110
07:11:45,960 --> 07:11:47,960
We're making a b-link for it.

6111
07:11:47,960 --> 07:11:49,960
A perfect match.

6112
07:11:49,960 --> 07:11:51,960
Thank you, Grandad.

6113
07:11:51,960 --> 07:11:53,960
I appreciate it. Do you want to do it again?

6114
07:11:53,960 --> 07:11:55,960
Maybe?

6115
07:11:55,960 --> 07:11:57,960
No, sorry.

6116
07:11:57,960 --> 07:11:59,960
Sorry for even asking.

6117
07:12:07,960 --> 07:12:09,960
Have my money, don't hurt me.

6118
07:12:11,960 --> 07:12:13,960
Why are you giving me money though?

6119
07:12:13,960 --> 07:12:15,960
Wait, where the heck am I doing?

6120
07:12:15,960 --> 07:12:17,960
A little to the left?

6121
07:12:19,960 --> 07:12:21,960
Thank you again

6122
07:12:21,960 --> 07:12:23,960
for the tips.

6123
07:12:25,960 --> 07:12:27,960
Why are you giving me pieces

6124
07:12:27,960 --> 07:12:29,960
that I can't even do anything with?

6125
07:12:29,960 --> 07:12:31,960
I can't even do anything with them.

6126
07:12:37,960 --> 07:12:39,960
The bad guys always drop coins.

6127
07:12:39,960 --> 07:12:41,960
I feel like the baddies actually drop a decent amount of coins.

6128
07:12:41,960 --> 07:12:43,960
I'm just making that up.

6129
07:12:43,960 --> 07:12:45,960
I can't remember what this was.

6130
07:12:45,960 --> 07:12:47,960
Thank you again, Broly Legends.

6131
07:12:47,960 --> 07:12:49,960
As I struggle to say your name.

6132
07:12:49,960 --> 07:12:51,960
I've already...

6133
07:12:51,960 --> 07:12:53,960
And you don't trade

6134
07:12:53,960 --> 07:12:55,960
because that would be too easy.

6135
07:12:55,960 --> 07:12:57,960
Don't forget to pay your taxes.

6136
07:12:57,960 --> 07:12:59,960
No smile.

6137
07:12:59,960 --> 07:13:01,960
Just kidding!

6138
07:13:01,960 --> 07:13:03,960
I pay my taxes.

6139
07:13:03,960 --> 07:13:05,960
Thank you, Australian Government, for letting me set up businesses in your country.

6140
07:13:05,960 --> 07:13:07,960
I should have better tax rates

6141
07:13:07,960 --> 07:13:09,960
than in the UK.

6142
07:13:09,960 --> 07:13:11,960
I should have gone to Australia.

6143
07:13:11,960 --> 07:13:13,960
Let me set up a business.

6144
07:13:13,960 --> 07:13:15,960
Set one up in Australia.

6145
07:13:23,960 --> 07:13:25,960
This isn't helping either.

6146
07:13:25,960 --> 07:13:27,960
I'm not making any profit doing that.

6147
07:13:29,960 --> 07:13:31,960
I think we're just going to have to go grass farming.

6148
07:13:31,960 --> 07:13:33,960
You know that.

6149
07:13:39,960 --> 07:13:41,960
I'm trying to make the money

6150
07:13:41,960 --> 07:13:43,960
and the shales

6151
07:13:43,960 --> 07:13:45,960
like that.

6152
07:13:45,960 --> 07:13:47,960
Like in the grass patch.

6153
07:13:47,960 --> 07:13:49,960
Because I can do a lot of it in one go.

6154
07:13:51,960 --> 07:13:53,960
I'm sorry.

6155
07:13:53,960 --> 07:13:55,960
She says that she gets absolutely annihilated.

6156
07:13:55,960 --> 07:13:57,960
Do these guys drop money?

6157
07:13:57,960 --> 07:13:59,960
No.

6158
07:13:59,960 --> 07:14:01,960
I'm sorry.

6159
07:14:07,960 --> 07:14:09,960
You're just going to have to wait for me.

6160
07:14:09,960 --> 07:14:11,960
Be patient.

6161
07:14:11,960 --> 07:14:13,960
Please.

6162
07:14:13,960 --> 07:14:15,960
Get annihilated.

6163
07:14:15,960 --> 07:14:17,960
Is the grass patch a buffer below me?

6164
07:14:17,960 --> 07:14:19,960
Look at the ball.

6165
07:14:19,960 --> 07:14:21,960
Maybe.

6166
07:14:21,960 --> 07:14:23,960
Oh, maybe Parasy wants to trade.

6167
07:14:23,960 --> 07:14:25,960
Parasy might want to trade.

6168
07:14:25,960 --> 07:14:27,960
At least use the spin attack on the grass.

6169
07:14:27,960 --> 07:14:29,960
You are so correct.

6170
07:14:29,960 --> 07:14:31,960
Holy crap.

6171
07:14:31,960 --> 07:14:33,960
Parasy doesn't care.

6172
07:14:33,960 --> 07:14:35,960

6187
07:15:05,960 --> 07:15:07,960
what was originally going on.

6188
07:15:09,960 --> 07:15:11,960

Okay.

6193
07:15:19,960 --> 07:15:21,960

Reflings suck that man off that suggested to do the spin attack

6213
07:16:23,060 --> 07:16:27,920
Kidding, that's actually not for me. It's more of an anything I think

07:16:28,940 --> 07:16:32,380
It's more of an anything. Yeah, we respect it. We respect it

6215

07:27:19,780 --> 07:27:27,780
No more no more but come back again. I'll get you more. Thanks mate. Uh, right. Let's get the reeflands with a nice yummy pie. Welcome

6339
07:27:29,300 --> 07:27:32,260
We need a pie before we go and deal with this enemy because

6340
07:27:33,140 --> 07:27:35,780
There was a kinsome. Oh, I got a red piece for that wall

6341
07:27:37,140 --> 07:27:38,980
Great fairy fountain song

6342
07:27:38,980 --> 07:27:44,100
It's when you when you finally meet strongy. Yes concern. Do I even need to buy these anymore?

6343
07:27:45,460 --> 07:27:47,460
Ah whatever

6344
07:27:48,340 --> 07:27:52,340
Ah, whatever in game test and lock behind worse side first

6345
07:27:54,820 --> 07:27:58,100
Well, I think that's all I can do. I think we're gonna go for it

6346
07:27:59,300 --> 07:28:04,580
Um, unfortunately, I don't know what I've missed. Do you guys say there's a few more ahead?

6347
07:28:06,100 --> 07:28:08,660
Oh, they're being guarded. I forgot. Pardon me

6348
07:28:10,740 --> 07:28:13,240
Okay reeflings it's time

6349
07:28:17,460 --> 07:28:19,780
I don't know how sensitive the ai is in this game

6350
07:28:24,340 --> 07:28:26,340
It doesn't seem too bad

6351
07:28:26,580 --> 07:28:29,460
Uh famous last words. I bet you it does seem too bad

6352
07:28:31,060 --> 07:28:33,060
I bet you a pie

6353
07:28:35,220 --> 07:28:38,500
Okay, okay. I'm not too bad. Not too bad. Let me get up. Let me get up

6354
07:28:40,580 --> 07:28:43,460
Don't want to be caught. Don't want to be caught right hide under here

6355
07:28:44,420 --> 07:28:51,460
Can't see us can't see us. Take it easy. Oh, I'm supposed to go for it there. It's

6356
07:28:53,140 --> 07:28:55,140
When he turns back

6357
07:28:55,780 --> 07:28:56,900
piss

6358
07:28:56,900 --> 07:28:58,900
How did you see me?

6359
07:28:59,700 --> 07:29:01,940
I'm okay. They're a little bit more sensitive than I thought

6360
07:29:03,380 --> 07:29:08,100
Look, it's not bad being sensitive, but she's giving me a chance, you know

6361
07:29:08,820 --> 07:29:10,820
I

6362
07:29:12,420 --> 07:29:14,420
Head behind this bush

6363
07:29:19,220 --> 07:29:21,220
There we go

6364
07:29:21,220 --> 07:29:23,220
Look at a split

6365
07:29:24,420 --> 07:29:26,420
And hide behind here

6366
07:29:27,300 --> 07:29:29,300
How did he see me?

6367
07:29:31,940 --> 07:29:37,700
Am I doing the taming wrong is there maybe maybe there's a taming on the bottom two down there that I don't know about

6368
07:29:38,340 --> 07:29:40,340
I'm struggling

6369
07:29:40,980 --> 07:29:42,980
I'm needing uh an

6370
07:29:43,300 --> 07:29:47,860
Invisible cloak that would probably go quite that would go down quite well. I'm not gonna lie

6371
07:29:49,780 --> 07:29:52,660
I think you have fusing left, but it's hunting down the people. Yes

6372
07:29:52,820 --> 07:29:56,900
It's definitely fusing because there's so many things that are blocked off and I'm like bro. I don't even

6373
07:29:58,180 --> 07:30:00,180
Sneak past them into that

6374
07:30:00,420 --> 07:30:02,420
He turns

6375
07:30:03,140 --> 07:30:07,540
No, okay, there's definitely some sort of tile distance. I cannot cross

6376
07:30:09,060 --> 07:30:11,060
Hey, I never even came in

6377
07:30:11,860 --> 07:30:14,740
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. I never even came in

6378
07:30:16,020 --> 07:30:18,740
Okay, definitely a tail distance. Keep that in mind

6379
07:30:22,660 --> 07:30:27,220
Tail distance any tail distance a analyzers

6380
07:30:28,820 --> 07:30:32,340
Analyze analyze analyze safe

6381
07:30:33,860 --> 07:30:37,860
Analyze analyze analyze safe

6382
07:30:39,060 --> 07:30:41,060
Analyze

6383
07:30:43,780 --> 07:30:46,820
It must be on the next input when he turns around go for it

6384
07:30:50,420 --> 07:30:52,420
Wow

6385
07:30:54,260 --> 07:30:56,260
Come on

6386
07:30:56,580 --> 07:31:00,820
Bro, we actually just want to like progress with the main quest. Can you just like let us in?

6387
07:31:02,420 --> 07:31:03,940
Can you just let us in we're

6388
07:31:04,020 --> 07:31:11,060
Genuinely just trying to play the game at this point not even like haha funny stealth like bro. We're just trying to play the game

6389
07:31:14,900 --> 07:31:16,900
Safe

6390
07:31:18,260 --> 07:31:23,540
Right when he goes down I can hide behind here, but then I need them to do another rotation

6391
07:31:25,700 --> 07:31:28,340
Which is fine and he will taste which is fine

6392
07:31:29,860 --> 07:31:31,860
He'll rotate

6393
07:31:31,860 --> 07:31:33,860
I'm out of you

6394
07:31:39,380 --> 07:31:41,380
Wah

6395
07:31:41,380 --> 07:31:42,740
Wah

6396
07:31:42,740 --> 07:31:44,740
Get that sword out right now

6397
07:31:46,660 --> 07:31:51,940
Oops, I hurt myself. It's fine. Oh wait, I don't have a full fairies. Do I I don't know where the other bottle is

6398
07:31:53,220 --> 07:31:55,220
I'll be an infusion need out

6399
07:31:56,260 --> 07:31:58,260
We made it

6400
07:32:02,820 --> 07:32:09,700
Okay, last element to infuse and everything's going to go all dark and not very nice, but that's just the way the games

6401
07:32:14,500 --> 07:32:16,500
And now it's golden

6402
07:32:19,220 --> 07:32:21,220
That looks like a beast of a sword

6403
07:32:24,740 --> 07:32:26,740
Oh, it's pretty

6404
07:32:27,620 --> 07:32:35,060
The power of the wind element has infused your blade with the power of the four elements your blade has become the four sword

6405
07:32:36,100 --> 07:32:42,660
Focus focus power in your blade and release a fire a beam use it to break batty's curse and restore the people

6406
07:32:50,100 --> 07:32:52,100
That's fantastic

6407
07:32:52,820 --> 07:32:54,260
Oh

6408
07:32:54,340 --> 07:32:59,940
Secret door. Hmm. Hmm. It seems that forging the sacred blade somehow opened that doorway

6409
07:33:00,180 --> 07:33:05,060
It must lead to the rooms that holds the secret of the light force link. We have to go inside

6410
07:33:07,140 --> 07:33:09,140
Oh

6411
07:33:09,860 --> 07:33:11,860
Oh

6412
07:33:12,260 --> 07:33:18,660
How interesting look at the images on the stained glass. I bet those pictures show us where the light force is hidden

6413
07:33:20,420 --> 07:33:23,540
In the principessa it's the opening

6414
07:33:25,140 --> 07:33:28,260
A long long time ago

6415
07:33:30,740 --> 07:33:34,100
When the world was on the verge of being swallowed by shadow

6416
07:33:39,940 --> 07:33:45,460
The tiny picori appeared from the sky bringing the hero of men a sword and a golden light

6417
07:33:47,540 --> 07:33:51,060
With wisdom and courage the hero drove out the darkness

6418
07:33:55,220 --> 07:34:02,180
When peace has been restored the people enshrined the blade with care

6419
07:34:04,660 --> 07:34:11,460
But here it is and the force of the golden light embodied in Hyrule's princess shone forth upon the land

6420
07:34:15,940 --> 07:34:17,940
So that's what it means

6421
07:34:18,260 --> 07:34:20,260
Oh

6422
07:34:20,500 --> 07:34:26,260
As low you really are too kind first you give me my magic cap and then you guide me here

6423
07:34:26,660 --> 07:34:31,380
You've been far too generous for now. I no longer have any useful. Yeah

6424
07:34:33,060 --> 07:34:35,060
Batty

6425
07:34:35,140 --> 07:34:37,140
Yes, that is brish. I don't know

6426
07:34:40,100 --> 07:34:42,100
What

6427
07:34:42,420 --> 07:34:49,060
At last I finally know the location of the light force it's the princess

6428
07:34:50,820 --> 07:34:52,980
Link wake up. Can you wake up?

6429
07:34:56,020 --> 07:34:59,780
Batty disguised himself as the king to search for the light force

6430
07:35:00,100 --> 07:35:05,780
When he learned of this place he waited for us to reforge the blade if that stained glass is accurate

6431
07:35:06,180 --> 07:35:11,460
Princess Zelda holds the light force batty will do whatever it takes to steal that power from her

6432
07:35:12,100 --> 07:35:17,700
If he succeeds, he may never be able to return the princess to normal

6433
07:35:18,500 --> 07:35:21,620
We've wasted too much time link. We must stop batty

6434
07:35:22,420 --> 07:35:25,860
Oh, yeah piss. Oh, yeah piss. We're on the timer. Are we actually though?

6435
07:35:26,900 --> 07:35:28,900
Or am I being trolled?

6436
07:35:30,740 --> 07:35:35,060
Why it's golden well, it's all different now, isn't it?

6437
07:35:38,020 --> 07:35:40,020
All different now

6438
07:35:42,420 --> 07:35:44,420
Oh

6439
07:35:46,900 --> 07:35:52,580
What what is this what's happened here? They've been turned to stone all of them the minister and the guard

6440
07:35:53,540 --> 07:35:58,180
Everyone in the castles like princess Zelda. This can only be the work of that evil batty

6441
07:35:58,260 --> 07:36:03,060
What cruelty link we must use the power of the sacred foresword to undo this evil

6442
07:36:03,060 --> 07:36:05,060
Oh

6443
07:36:12,100 --> 07:36:14,660
Thank you. Thank you. You're the one who returned me to normal, aren't you?

6444
07:36:14,980 --> 07:36:19,700
I don't know how you did it, but I cannot thank you enough. Listen. Have you seen how strange the king's been lately?

6445
07:36:20,020 --> 07:36:23,540
That's because it's not the king at all. It's batty. He's taken over the castle

6446
07:36:24,100 --> 07:36:28,100
One by one. He's turned us all to stone everyone cursed by his evil magic

6447
07:36:28,500 --> 07:36:31,620
Then the monsters arrived even paralyzed. I saw it all

6448
07:36:32,180 --> 07:36:35,380
I only pray it's not too late to undo this evil

6449
07:36:40,500 --> 07:36:42,500
There's so many

6450
07:36:43,540 --> 07:36:48,500
Link we need your help batty took a petrified princess to the roof of the castello

6451
07:36:48,820 --> 07:36:54,820
He must be planning something fiendish. You must stop him. I'm going. I'm going. Fuck me. I've only got two fairies in a ball

6452
07:36:56,340 --> 07:36:58,340
You're in my way, mate

6453
07:36:58,740 --> 07:37:02,100
Okay, we can get past

6454
07:37:03,540 --> 07:37:06,260
Thanks, mate. Thanks for not putting me in a dialogue as well actually

6455
07:37:06,980 --> 07:37:08,980
dark hyrule castello

6456
07:37:10,340 --> 07:37:11,540
Oh

6457
07:37:11,540 --> 07:37:15,220
Is this really hyrule castle? I can't believe it. What's happened here?

6458
07:37:15,540 --> 07:37:18,180
Patty's magic has grown more powerful than I imagined

6459
07:37:18,660 --> 07:37:21,540
But the king and zelda are in danger link. We need to go

6460
07:37:22,820 --> 07:37:25,380
Oh castle, but evil literally

6461
07:37:26,340 --> 07:37:31,060
Oh, I'm not full health. So I can't oh, I'm definitely not full health after that you don't

6462
07:37:32,660 --> 07:37:34,660
Fucking wait to add it up

6463
07:37:36,900 --> 07:37:38,900
These are fake rooms, yeah

6464
07:37:45,540 --> 07:37:47,540
Surely I won't burn myself

6465
07:37:56,180 --> 07:37:58,180
Oh

6466
07:37:58,180 --> 07:38:00,180
We go because we don't have the key

6467
07:38:05,460 --> 07:38:08,340
Oh the jail cell we'll get the jail

6468
07:38:09,620 --> 07:38:15,620
Can I undo you from here? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry. Sorry king. Oh, I can't eat you

6469
07:38:16,580 --> 07:38:18,580
Hold on. Hold on

6470
07:38:19,060 --> 07:38:23,220
Is this the final dungeon? I think so question mark

6471
07:38:24,180 --> 07:38:29,540
Fairy fairy fairy fairy. I've never been happier. See one of you you

6472
07:38:31,620 --> 07:38:33,620
You yank

6473
07:38:35,860 --> 07:38:38,420
I caught a fairy in a ball

6474
07:38:39,220 --> 07:38:46,020
Right there we go. We're fully healed now. We have three fairies at our disposal. Let's we'll put the name mess up a bit too much

6475
07:38:47,460 --> 07:38:49,780
Um, I don't have a key

6476
07:38:49,780 --> 07:38:55,060
I can't go that way but I can at least come in the back faster

6477
07:39:01,380 --> 07:39:06,980
I very easily could have gone wait, what the fuck am I trying to do? Sorry

6478
07:39:10,180 --> 07:39:12,660
I'm not supposed to be here yet

6479
07:39:13,220 --> 07:39:15,220
Thank you

6480
07:39:16,180 --> 07:39:21,540
Is it the same layout in super mario castle? Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to be there. I assume

6481
07:39:24,820 --> 07:39:31,060
I'm supposed to oh well the game is the game said take what you need right? I even need arrows. No, I don't

Wait, so I was supposed to what am I missing? I'm missing something

6483
07:39:36,660 --> 07:39:42,820
That was a fake door. This is a fake door. No, it's not okay

6484
07:39:45,060 --> 07:39:48,660
Uh, let's jump see if there's some time

And you next and you next nope

I'd rather stay feel healthy. Okay. That's a fake door. So there's something down here. I apologize

6489
07:40:11,940 --> 07:40:18,180
Am I to fall in the gap? Maybe that's what drops me into the cell. Okay. I think the gap drops me into the cell

6490
07:40:21,460 --> 07:40:26,980
Boss battle imminent and everyone's reset because why would we not reset?

6491
07:40:26,980 --> 07:40:28,980
Yep

6492
07:40:30,420 --> 07:40:36,740
No, this is just here. Okay that okay. I'm missing something. Sorry. Give me a second. I'm missing something

6493

Now rattle the cages rattle rattle. Okay can't rattle the cages like a feral dog

6494
07:40:43,060 --> 07:40:45,060
Hmm

6495
07:40:55,940 --> 07:40:58,260
I can see I can get small there

6496
07:41:00,020 --> 07:41:02,020
Right now what?

6497
07:41:03,220 --> 07:41:07,860
Open sesame literally wait, can I like batter the door down maybe?

6498

Oh

6499
07:41:17,700 --> 07:41:20,420
Should have been through the kids it seems to get blocked there

6500
07:41:23,700 --> 07:41:28,420
Yeah, it's getting blocked so I can't do that. I need a key to get to him

6501
07:41:32,180 --> 07:41:34,500
Spoiler alert, this isn't the final dungeon

6502
07:41:36,260 --> 07:41:41,780
If this isn't the final dungeon, I think I'm gonna need to call a food break. I'm already stuck

6503
07:41:41,940 --> 07:41:43,940
And I've not even gotten started

6504
07:41:45,540 --> 07:41:48,900
Is there really nothing back this way? Is it like a bomb?

6505
07:41:50,580 --> 07:41:54,100
Is there a tail that oh, there's a bomb on the wall, bro

6506
07:41:55,940 --> 07:41:57,940
Of course it's a bomb

6507
07:41:59,700 --> 07:42:02,740
I knew something was me right there. I was like, this is me

6508
07:42:05,300 --> 07:42:07,300
This is me working it

6509
07:42:08,180 --> 07:42:10,500
As if you come flying over to me

6510
07:42:12,500 --> 07:42:16,100
Okay, I need to fall down as a medium

6511
07:42:19,540 --> 07:42:21,940
This makes much more sense now

6512
07:42:23,860 --> 07:42:27,860
I was like there must be a wall I'm missing because I can't interact with anything that seems

6513
07:42:30,660 --> 07:42:34,100
Okay, I assume the switch is gonna open up the gates

6514
07:42:35,060 --> 07:42:44,100
Now although that makes no sense, I'm not going to question it at all and instead be thankful

6515
07:42:50,260 --> 07:42:52,180
Hello

6516
07:42:52,180 --> 07:42:55,940
Oh Link, are you the one who broke the curse and returned me to normal?

6517
07:42:55,940 --> 07:42:59,300
You've gone you've gone quite brave since the last time I saw you. I must say

6518
07:42:59,540 --> 07:43:01,540
Oh, but how those kisses

6519
07:43:01,940 --> 07:43:03,860
My love is under vice curse

6520
07:43:03,860 --> 07:43:08,260
Is this all the work of one man as king of hyrule? I must do something about this villain

6521
07:43:08,420 --> 07:43:13,060
But I'm old and I would only hold you back link. You have the sacred blade now

6522
07:43:13,060 --> 07:43:14,340
We must

6523
07:43:14,340 --> 07:43:18,260
You're gonna rely on the 12 year old. Please you must find a way to rescue my Zelda

6524
07:43:18,340 --> 07:43:21,460
Take the key. You can use it to get out of the castle from the basement

6525
07:43:22,020 --> 07:43:25,060
Ah use it to open locked doors. Yes

6526
07:43:27,060 --> 07:43:29,060
I will absolutely take that

6527
07:43:30,260 --> 07:43:34,420
Yeah, I said if you put the switch that opens the cell in the cell that shall I'm like, hmm

6528
07:43:34,420 --> 07:43:37,540
Not sure this would work out in theory. Maybe if it was like one-on-one

6529
07:43:39,540 --> 07:43:41,540
Actually

6530
07:43:43,540 --> 07:43:45,540
Link my boy

6531
07:43:47,060 --> 07:43:53,860
I might have to call a break and get like food in that and maybe try and squeeze out a loaf of bread, you know

6532
07:43:54,420 --> 07:43:58,180
It's not really it's not really happening. I'm not really sure what's going on with the look of bread situation

6533
07:43:59,060 --> 07:44:01,060
Okay, here we go. Here we go

6534
07:44:04,820 --> 07:44:06,820
I don't know how I avoided that but

6535
07:44:12,020 --> 07:44:14,180
I think there was a chest over here

6536
07:44:16,900 --> 07:44:18,900
There is

6537
07:44:21,380 --> 07:44:23,860
Do we even want to see how big this dungeon is

6538
07:44:23,860 --> 07:44:27,860
It's five levels

6539
07:44:38,100 --> 07:44:44,740
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna go with uh, let me get a break. Um, and I'll get some real food on me and

6540
07:44:45,300 --> 07:44:48,660
rehydrate and all that because uh, yeah, this is going to

6541
07:44:48,820 --> 07:44:54,180
Like how much time until mercy we've got less than an hour to try and do all of this

6542
07:44:55,220 --> 07:44:58,020
No an hour and 15 sorry and then mercy comes on

6543
07:45:08,660 --> 07:45:10,660
Wow

6544
07:45:10,660 --> 07:45:14,260
Lower time values sometimes referred to as the sage of dark winds and it is

6545
07:45:15,220 --> 07:45:18,260
Hected in later games as a demonic winged eyeball

6546
07:45:19,140 --> 07:45:22,180
He makes his home in the tower of winds, which is his final dungeon

6547
07:45:23,300 --> 07:45:25,060
Not the temple ones

6548
07:45:25,060 --> 07:45:30,580
Uh, right give me a minute. I'm gonna make a tea. I'm gonna make some lefto berries

6549
07:45:30,660 --> 07:45:33,220
I have no idea why even having the fridge to be honest

6550
07:45:34,340 --> 07:45:38,500
Um, and I'm gonna bake a loaf of bread not in all in that order

6551
07:45:39,540 --> 07:45:42,420
Some of the orders might be different, but I think we can do it

6552
07:45:42,420 --> 07:45:47,700
I think we can finish before mercy if I don't if I don't get absolutely rolled and smoked

6553
07:45:48,980 --> 07:45:52,180
Need to be on my a-game though. Need to be on my a-game

6554
07:45:52,740 --> 07:45:54,340
all right

6555
07:45:54,340 --> 07:45:58,260
Stoney buy some prunes. Actually, I have chocolate raisins

6556
07:45:58,340 --> 07:46:02,980
I've tried to eat them like twice on stream so far and I keep forgetting about them. Are we gonna raid into mercy?

6557
07:46:02,980 --> 07:46:04,980
I'm gonna try to raid into mercy. Yes

6558
07:46:05,940 --> 07:46:07,060
um

6559
07:46:07,060 --> 07:46:09,860
Oh, is that what that slot is for? Hold on

6560
07:46:12,180 --> 07:46:13,060
No

6561
07:46:13,060 --> 07:46:17,300
What the frick are these did anyone type what these are for or is it just like random space?

6562
07:46:17,380 --> 07:46:20,420
Nah, I can't even be random space. It looks like I'm gonna put it everywhere

6563
07:46:22,180 --> 07:46:24,180
Um

6564
07:46:24,980 --> 07:46:28,900
Right we speedrunning well, hopefully we can do it in the mirror

6565
07:46:32,500 --> 07:46:37,860
I'll let you guys analyze the mask okay, so you can tell me where I go when we get to that section

6566
07:46:38,020 --> 07:46:40,180
I'm sure you guys will be able to tell me where I go

6567
07:46:41,460 --> 07:46:44,420
Raisins do have some fiber even though they're covered in chocolate

6568
07:46:44,820 --> 07:46:46,660
do they count

6569
07:46:46,660 --> 07:46:51,140
Right, I'm uh, I'm gonna be a solid few minutes because you know, I don't know about you

6570
07:46:51,300 --> 07:46:53,860
But when I go to the toilet, you know, you need to bake the look

6571
07:46:54,740 --> 07:46:58,500
Right, I'll be back as quick as I can. Please stretch. Please get some water in here

6572
07:46:58,500 --> 07:47:03,540
Please go toilet time if you need toilet time and please go to sleep if you need to go honk

6573
07:47:04,660 --> 07:47:08,340
Honk, okay, I'll be back and very shortly. Okay

6574
07:47:16,660 --> 07:47:18,660
So

6575
07:47:46,660 --> 07:47:48,660
So

6576
07:48:16,660 --> 07:48:18,660
So

6577
07:48:46,660 --> 07:48:48,660
So

6578
07:49:16,660 --> 07:49:18,660
So

6579
07:49:46,660 --> 07:49:48,660
So

6580
07:50:16,660 --> 07:50:18,660
So

6581
07:50:24,260 --> 07:50:26,260
Are you squidding me right now

6582
07:50:26,260 --> 07:50:28,260
So

6583
07:50:46,260 --> 07:50:48,260
Are you squidding me right now

6584
07:50:56,260 --> 07:50:58,260
So

6585
07:51:14,260 --> 07:51:16,260
Are you squidding me right now

6586
07:51:26,260 --> 07:51:28,260
So

6587
07:51:50,260 --> 07:51:52,260
Are you squidding me right now

6588
07:51:56,260 --> 07:51:58,260
So

6589
07:52:00,260 --> 07:52:02,260
Are you squidding me right now

6590
07:52:14,260 --> 07:52:16,260
Are you squidding me right now

6591
07:52:16,260 --> 07:52:18,260
Are you squidding me right now

6592
07:52:24,260 --> 07:52:26,260
Are you squidding me right now

6593
07:52:34,260 --> 07:52:36,260
Are you squidding me right now

6594
07:52:36,260 --> 07:52:38,260
Are you squidding me right now

6595
07:52:44,260 --> 07:52:46,260
Are you squidding me right now

6596
07:52:46,260 --> 07:52:48,260
Are you squidding me right now

6597
07:53:02,260 --> 07:53:04,260
Are you squidding me right now

6598
07:53:12,260 --> 07:53:14,260
What the fuck are you giving me

6599
07:53:16,260 --> 07:53:18,260
Oh

6600
07:53:28,260 --> 07:53:30,260
It's actually quite a lot

6601
07:53:34,260 --> 07:53:36,260
I

6602
07:53:38,260 --> 07:53:40,260
Imperial monarch

6603
07:53:40,260 --> 07:53:42,260
Logo Dogo

6604
07:53:42,260 --> 07:53:44,260
Logo Dogo

6605
07:53:48,260 --> 07:53:50,260
I'm

6606
07:53:56,260 --> 07:54:01,260
I know and it's your time. Yeah, I don't know where caca anon is but we're calling upon you. I've had enough

6607
07:54:02,260 --> 07:54:06,260
I've had enough of King Kong's finger knocking at the door then disappearing away again

6608
07:54:06,260 --> 07:54:08,260
I'm getting tired

6609
07:54:10,260 --> 07:54:12,260
Fake door

6610
07:54:12,260 --> 07:54:14,260
Real

6611
07:54:14,260 --> 07:54:16,260
Dark Glasgow castle

6612
07:54:16,260 --> 07:54:18,260
Glasgow DLC unlocked

6613
07:54:20,260 --> 07:54:22,260
No idea what this is supposed to go

6614
07:54:26,260 --> 07:54:28,260
Have I just

6615
07:54:28,260 --> 07:54:30,260
No, definitely not that way

6616
07:54:30,260 --> 07:54:32,260
I

6617
07:54:38,260 --> 07:54:40,260
Can't believe it

6618
07:54:50,260 --> 07:54:58,260
The bread might be a little overcooked by now. Yeah, the bread might be reekin

6619
07:55:00,260 --> 07:55:07,760
Perhaps the sword could reflect the black as low as low mate. I was in the middle of it. Maybe doing that

6620
07:55:14,260 --> 07:55:16,260
Christ

6621
07:55:17,760 --> 07:55:20,260
Something tells me my Scottish rage might come out

6622
07:55:20,260 --> 07:55:22,260
Hmm

6623
07:55:26,260 --> 07:55:28,760
I'm about to order take away to reward myself

6624
07:55:28,760 --> 07:55:35,760
I think this part of the game gets incredibly hard and like no child should be able to actually complete it as I said bye

6625
07:55:37,260 --> 07:55:39,260
I wouldn't work at lunch and strong he's still alive

6626
07:55:42,260 --> 07:55:44,260
We're gonna try and redirect him to me

6627
07:55:45,260 --> 07:55:49,260
Yeah, yeah, can stone pieces

6628
07:55:55,260 --> 07:55:57,260
Yes, order lots of takeaway right hold on

6629
07:56:02,260 --> 07:56:04,260
That cheeky sighting

6630
07:56:07,260 --> 07:56:11,260
What are we feeling feeling a burger I think I'm

6631
07:56:15,260 --> 07:56:17,260
Okay

6632
07:56:19,260 --> 07:56:21,260
My easy-peasy burger I

6633
07:56:22,260 --> 07:56:28,820
Have to admit my diet my diet gets terrible when I'm strumming because I don't have time to cook

6634
07:56:29,660 --> 07:56:32,540
So we do we do a little pickle

6635
07:56:44,260 --> 07:56:49,860
Burger chips what drink cooler spray? I've just made a tea though

6636
07:56:50,700 --> 07:56:53,500
I'm probably probably a spray to wash that

6637
07:57:07,260 --> 07:57:09,260
I don't know

6638
07:57:10,260 --> 07:57:14,820
And I'm not full health, so I can't even do the thing

6639
07:57:15,780 --> 07:57:19,060
Right. Yeah. Oh Dale has been made. We know wait

6640
07:57:20,300 --> 07:57:22,300
She got it

6641
07:57:24,060 --> 07:57:26,560
How do I get away with this? Oh

6642
07:57:29,820 --> 07:57:34,060
Geez they are not making this easy holy shit children are supposed to do this. Oh

6643
07:57:36,020 --> 07:57:38,820
I think the Scottish rage is gonna come out from being honest

6644
07:57:39,380 --> 07:57:41,380
All right

6645
07:57:45,060 --> 07:57:47,060
These indestructible

6646
07:57:54,300 --> 07:58:00,820
You want the rage to come out are you sure you want the rage to come out I don't

6647
07:58:01,820 --> 07:58:03,820
I

6648
07:58:05,660 --> 07:58:09,060
Assume it destroys my little shadows as well

6649
07:58:13,780 --> 07:58:16,460
I was supposed to just send it okay juice have this

6650
07:58:17,140 --> 07:58:19,140
Rookie that's the good news

6651
07:58:19,700 --> 07:58:25,380
Let's put the cape back on because we can probably negate a bit of damage just using the cape and getting away

6652
07:58:26,220 --> 07:58:31,140
Oh, there was that locked door back on the stairwell to the right

6653
07:58:33,620 --> 07:58:35,980
And it was an actual door it wasn't a tribute

6654
07:58:39,660 --> 07:58:44,100
Right that's to jump down which I don't want to do shadow was your money

6655
07:58:44,100 --> 07:58:46,100
Oh

6656
07:58:53,460 --> 07:58:55,460
Surprise

6657
07:59:14,100 --> 07:59:20,260
It's not a spin attack or maybe it's the spin twirl attack hold on. I'll be the spin twirl. Oh

6658
07:59:22,740 --> 07:59:24,740
Okay

6659
07:59:25,220 --> 07:59:27,220
What

6660
07:59:28,380 --> 07:59:32,940
I use the spin attack it has to be it can't be the other one

6661
07:59:36,900 --> 07:59:42,820
No, it's moving me about though sugar what it has to be the spin attack

6662
07:59:44,100 --> 07:59:46,100
Is it just like a position?

6663
07:59:57,580 --> 08:00:05,140
Help hold hand, please any handholders. Oh, sorry. Sorry. That was me that time

6664
08:00:05,140 --> 08:00:07,140
I

6665
08:00:07,500 --> 08:00:11,060
Has to be this right let them shoot how

6666
08:00:12,700 --> 08:00:14,700
And then in position

6667
08:00:16,380 --> 08:00:18,980
I knew it. I knew it was a spin attack has to be

6668
08:00:18,980 --> 08:00:20,980
I

6669
08:00:31,860 --> 08:00:34,740
Am just spamming so I don't take HB damage

6670
08:00:38,340 --> 08:00:40,340
You're done. Oh, I miss

6671
08:00:42,580 --> 08:00:48,140
Like thank goodness we don't need money anymore, so I'm saying I'd be raging

6672
08:00:49,620 --> 08:00:54,340
Wait, there's no key

6673
08:01:02,460 --> 08:01:04,460
I was just for money

6674
08:01:09,100 --> 08:01:11,100
Oh, no, we're back at the star

6675
08:01:17,060 --> 08:01:18,860
Oops

6676
08:01:19,940 --> 08:01:21,940

6677
08:01:25,140 --> 08:01:27,140
Oops

6678
08:01:27,140 --> 08:01:29,140
Oh

6679
08:01:43,620 --> 08:01:50,920
Everything's good on the hood. Oh, sorry. I'll swap them back. I'm gonna get very confused very fast

6680
08:01:57,500 --> 08:02:04,700
I've gone the wrong way and I'm I'm all turned around now. Sorry, let me jump past you guys

6681
08:02:08,420 --> 08:02:10,420
There wasn't anything back there

6682
08:02:12,340 --> 08:02:17,900
Or is it a hidden bomb spot probably it's always you know what it's always a hidden bomb spot was this

6683
08:02:20,820 --> 08:02:23,220
What are the guards nice to me all of a sudden

6684
08:02:24,380 --> 08:02:26,380
Ring the guards

6685
08:02:26,780 --> 08:02:32,300
Wasn't there not a teacher guy down here. Did he teach me something? Nope. There was definitely not a teacher guy

6686
08:02:35,700 --> 08:02:38,300
Hold on a minute enemy spotted

6687
08:02:41,820 --> 08:02:49,860
Hold on a bean basil and booze and momentum do my little elf eyes deceive me

No, they do not well, I don't actually need that but thanks

6689
08:02:57,140 --> 08:03:03,460
I don't need it anymore, but I do appreciate the sentiment nonetheless, and we already spoke to this person

6690
08:03:06,460 --> 08:03:08,460
Visitor her rear

6691
08:03:19,420 --> 08:03:21,420
Wait, was it you that teaches me

6692

6693
08:03:29,780 --> 08:03:31,700
What do you do?

6694
08:03:31,700 --> 08:03:34,760
Hold on we're doing side quests already by accident

6695
08:03:36,980 --> 08:03:42,780
The waterfall one right, sorry, we're gonna go do that because music lovers under waterfalls is like really important

6696

08:03:48,060 --> 08:03:50,060
Yeah, it's like a road to the rest

6698
08:03:50,540 --> 08:03:55,180
Sorry, hold on. I didn't even ask you if you could train me. I just got really interested in the Kinstone

6699
08:03:57,300 --> 08:03:59,300
Okay, I already know

6700
08:04:00,460 --> 08:04:02,460
You just taught me all I need to know

6701
08:04:03,500 --> 08:04:06,980
Right, so I'm actually gonna be a naughty Nellie and leave the castle

6702
08:04:06,980 --> 08:04:10,400
I know who Zelda needs help, but so is it's not my problem like that

6703
08:04:13,500 --> 08:04:17,300
And maybe your problem, but it's not mean right at this very moment, you know

Hmm now I'll teach you how to fill your split gauge faster than ever. I take visually

6715
08:05:24,620 --> 08:05:28,780
Training very seriously. I'll have you know spot visualize your body split and even faster

6716
08:05:29,900 --> 08:05:31,900
Spell lifting

6717
08:05:31,980 --> 08:05:33,980
Huh

6718
08:05:33,980 --> 08:05:37,900
Now you will fill your spirit gauge much faster. Oh, okay

6719
08:05:38,860 --> 08:05:42,060
Okay, um, I'm doing it. Oh

08:05:43,180 --> 08:05:45,180
Yeah, that's bass

6721
08:05:45,260 --> 08:05:47,260
I'm a I'm a I'm a take

6722
08:05:47,580 --> 08:05:51,660
Thank you for that. Thank you. I'm a visual learner too strong. So

6723
08:05:57,900 --> 08:05:59,820
That might order coming in fast, so we

6724
08:06:01,100 --> 08:06:03,100
It's already been updated on the status

6725
08:06:04,060 --> 08:06:09,580
Don't mind me. I'm gonna be in the middle of the boss fight. I'll be like, no, leave out the door mate. Leave out the door. Hold on

6726
08:06:13,420 --> 08:06:15,420
Right, let's try to cast in

6727
08:06:17,660 --> 08:06:19,660
I went

6728
08:06:20,460 --> 08:06:22,460
way

6729
08:06:22,860 --> 08:06:24,860
Somewhere to the right I'm to go

6730
08:06:25,980 --> 08:06:32,460
And if I jump down there, yeah, so that's definitely not that way. I'll walk straight into that not gonna lie

6731
08:06:34,060 --> 08:06:36,060
And if I jump down there, I've already been

6732
08:06:42,700 --> 08:06:46,860
And this was a dead end. Is this like a vomit kind of end?

6733
08:06:51,660 --> 08:06:56,700
What so this as if the ball spawned back I'm sure whatever

6734
08:07:03,100 --> 08:07:05,100
Yeah, nice try this time

6735
08:07:08,140 --> 08:07:10,860
Bomb the carpet like Isaac's style

6736
08:07:12,540 --> 08:07:14,540
No bomb here

6737
08:07:15,340 --> 08:07:20,380
Like I've got enough bombs to waste. Okay, let's tell them isn't it? There's gotta be something in that wonder. That's what I thought

6738
08:07:21,340 --> 08:07:23,340
I've gotta go back to work. Have fun at work

6739
08:07:26,140 --> 08:07:28,140
Suck up the carpet

6740
08:07:28,380 --> 08:07:32,860
Maybe something drops in this room and we're just a step too far ahead

6741
08:07:37,020 --> 08:07:39,020
Because I mean

6742
08:07:42,300 --> 08:07:45,500
I mean I can check if there's a oh

6743
08:07:48,940 --> 08:07:53,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I knew it. I knew it couldn't have been finished

6744
08:07:58,460 --> 08:08:02,140
Where are we heading? I'm getting nervous. Oh, it's the

6745
08:08:04,620 --> 08:08:06,620
Out in nowhere

6746
08:08:12,620 --> 08:08:14,620
And I accidentally actually dodged that

6747
08:08:17,580 --> 08:08:19,420
Oh

6748
08:08:19,420 --> 08:08:22,940
The chair just shook move that motherfucker thing. I saw it shake

6749
08:08:23,980 --> 08:08:25,980
Yeah

6750
08:08:26,860 --> 08:08:28,860
That's just an end room

6751
08:08:30,220 --> 08:08:33,740
Compass I will absolutely take a compass. What did it change?

6752
08:08:36,860 --> 08:08:40,220
Where's the compass change tells you where there's a loot and stuff

6753
08:08:41,900 --> 08:08:43,900
Shawnee getting so good. Yeah

6754
08:08:44,540 --> 08:08:46,540
Yeah

6755
08:08:54,700 --> 08:08:59,740
Sorry, I'm just doing distance. I I don't want to lose my ability to do this distance attack

6756
08:09:01,100 --> 08:09:08,140
Because it's like helping me get past areas without taking any damage type thing and obviously if I take damage

6757
08:09:08,140 --> 08:09:10,140
I can longer do this move

6758
08:09:10,620 --> 08:09:13,100
So I'm quite appreciative of it

6759
08:09:13,900 --> 08:09:15,900
So

6760
08:09:16,140 --> 08:09:18,860
Oh he what he could do

6761
08:09:37,500 --> 08:09:39,500
I'm just checking

6762
08:09:40,140 --> 08:09:42,140
The weird corner room

6763
08:09:43,900 --> 08:09:48,940
Okay, just uh, just a wee weird corner room. Sorry a little gamer sense was going off, but it must have been the wind

6764
08:09:50,460 --> 08:09:52,460
That must have just been bad. Yeah

6765
08:09:52,620 --> 08:09:54,620
You funk. Thank you

6766
08:10:08,380 --> 08:10:12,860
I don't know can I like okay that was incredibly silly um

6767
08:10:13,980 --> 08:10:15,980
I

6768
08:10:20,140 --> 08:10:23,260
Does it take me out of the air or does the game just be like, yeah

6769
08:10:25,580 --> 08:10:27,900
I mean didn't take me out of the air

6770
08:10:29,900 --> 08:10:33,580
That's quite a facial expression want me being a goofy giver

6771
08:10:36,860 --> 08:10:40,220
I literally did not trust any wall right now because of that

6772
08:10:44,620 --> 08:10:46,620
It looks beautiful

6773
08:10:52,140 --> 08:10:58,140
All right, what's the dealio? I need to get to the four. Oh, I burnt myself twice. I saw it

6774
08:10:59,500 --> 08:11:02,300
Couldn't see it properly because of the metal grate above

6775
08:11:05,340 --> 08:11:07,340
Let's see how this goes

6776
08:11:07,420 --> 08:11:09,420
I

6777
08:11:10,860 --> 08:11:17,820
Wait, I get put on fire for one of my phantoms. Yeah, sorry not buying that mate

6778
08:11:22,300 --> 08:11:24,300
Are you doing time?

6779
08:11:29,420 --> 08:11:31,420
Please don't make me do this again

6780
08:11:31,420 --> 08:11:33,420
Oh

6781
08:11:36,940 --> 08:11:38,940
There you go, how do you like that? You don't

6782
08:11:41,580 --> 08:11:49,020
If you goober god, this map is intense. Sorry, but holy crap. We're like flying about the place. We've got bombas going on

6783
08:11:51,420 --> 08:11:53,420
Can I like

6784
08:11:54,940 --> 08:11:56,940
No, wow

6785
08:11:57,820 --> 08:11:59,820
They're just go for it

6786
08:12:00,460 --> 08:12:02,460
I can't do anything

6787
08:12:04,540 --> 08:12:09,100
Well, if I can't do anything, there's no point in crying about it. Let's just take the heat take the damage

6788
08:12:09,900 --> 08:12:11,900
I don't know what I'm supposed to do

6789
08:12:13,340 --> 08:12:15,340
Okay, thank you

6790
08:12:22,620 --> 08:12:26,060
I'll make it to this one a little to the ray

6791
08:12:27,020 --> 08:12:30,700
Okay, we did it. We did it. We did it. We're getting there

6792
08:12:35,100 --> 08:12:37,100
I like that we're one shot

6793
08:12:41,180 --> 08:12:47,900
Okay, this there's just two random enemies here. Oh, there's a bridge. Oh, please

6794
08:12:48,860 --> 08:12:50,860
I

6795
08:12:53,580 --> 08:12:57,500
Intrusting them now there is a building through in here. So I'll go in here

6796
08:12:59,340 --> 08:13:01,340
To the dead end

6797
08:13:05,100 --> 08:13:13,180
Uh, not really sure if I'm to do anything at all actually. I don't think so. I'm supposed to shoot in my arrows

6798
08:13:14,060 --> 08:13:19,500
Oh, no, no, I'm not. Okay. Well, I'm not supposed to do this section at all. Hi

6799
08:13:20,700 --> 08:13:26,220
Thanks, please join in. We are currently on the last dungeon bit on Zell law

6800
08:13:27,100 --> 08:13:33,100
Uh, I'm also getting very nervous because I'm not very good at this section. I don't recall ever

6801
08:13:34,060 --> 08:13:36,060
finding it easy. Um

6802
08:13:37,020 --> 08:13:39,580
So childhood me kind of going out the window right now

6803
08:13:40,540 --> 08:13:42,540
It help wise

6804
08:13:43,580 --> 08:13:45,580
Oh

6805
08:13:47,740 --> 08:13:51,980
Whoa, that's what you get for being too close. Yeah, take that stinker

6806
08:13:53,980 --> 08:13:55,980
Stinky McGee

6807
08:14:01,100 --> 08:14:03,980
Oh, is that what the problem is?

6808
08:14:07,180 --> 08:14:09,180
Oh, well, there's not much of a problem

6809
08:14:09,260 --> 08:14:14,780
You're doing great so far we're getting there. I

6810
08:14:20,700 --> 08:14:22,700
Whoa

6811
08:14:23,980 --> 08:14:25,980
This is that's not hurting them

6812
08:14:31,740 --> 08:14:33,740
There's two of them

6813
08:14:34,140 --> 08:14:36,140
Oh

6814
08:14:37,660 --> 08:14:39,660
This is a bit of a

6815
08:14:42,620 --> 08:14:44,620
Have a hand moment

6816
08:14:47,020 --> 08:14:49,020
Got a cheap shot and

6817
08:14:51,820 --> 08:14:53,820
Throw it again. How dare you

6818
08:14:54,380 --> 08:14:59,420
Out. Okay. Whoa. I think they hit for a whole health. That's not good for at all

6819
08:15:00,380 --> 08:15:05,580
Yeah, if you guys can kind of separate yourselves off so you can get a few wax in that group

6820
08:15:07,340 --> 08:15:09,340
Do it again throw it again

6821
08:15:09,740 --> 08:15:14,300
See when they come in together like that, they don't like that. That's hard to kind of

6822
08:15:15,100 --> 08:15:16,860
can't even reach

6823
08:15:16,860 --> 08:15:18,860
can't even reach

6824
08:15:20,300 --> 08:15:26,620
Can't even reach my cheeks and that other guy is now protecting him because they're now stacked up uh game dips

6825
08:15:26,620 --> 08:15:32,060
If you could patch that out right now. Yeah. No, no, I understand. It's a very old. Wow

6826
08:15:32,140 --> 08:15:35,420
They are actually whacking me for one. I do not like that

6827
08:15:37,020 --> 08:15:39,020
I do not like that at all

6828
08:15:39,340 --> 08:15:41,340
Not one itty bitty bit

6829
08:15:42,220 --> 08:15:47,340
Okay, okay, okay much more. Yeah. Yeah. I deserve 50 for that. I'm not gonna lie

6830
08:15:48,860 --> 08:15:52,620
Do you want to throw it or we're just gonna play ball for the there we go

6831
08:15:53,340 --> 08:15:55,340
Okay

6832
08:15:55,740 --> 08:16:01,900
So what is where does the red take us just for curiosity? It takes us to the start of the castle

6833
08:16:03,100 --> 08:16:06,140
So if we really are up Shisa Creek, then we can

6834
08:16:07,260 --> 08:16:11,660
You can stun them with the boomerang. Okay. I think there was two of them. I was a bit like

6835
08:16:12,860 --> 08:16:16,380
But we do have a check point which is huge

6836
08:16:16,380 --> 08:16:25,020
That's not the right way that's opened by uh, is this a wall moment?

6837
08:16:26,780 --> 08:16:28,780
Yeah, it's not

6838
08:16:29,420 --> 08:16:33,900
We have a check point. That's the main thing. That's the most important thing. Okay that we have a checkpoint

6839
08:16:35,340 --> 08:16:37,820
Because this game's getting scary

6840
08:16:39,660 --> 08:16:44,380
If the enemy through starting to thwack for one, I'm not quite confident

6841
08:16:46,380 --> 08:16:48,380
I

6842
08:16:52,620 --> 08:16:54,620
You just put a bomb on this

6843
08:16:55,740 --> 08:16:58,140
Oh it falls well

6844
08:17:00,140 --> 08:17:02,140
Oh, that's the wrong one. Sorry

6845
08:17:04,780 --> 08:17:06,780
Huh

6846
08:17:10,540 --> 08:17:12,540
So what's the bomb before

6847
08:17:12,940 --> 08:17:14,940
Sorry

6848
08:17:26,700 --> 08:17:33,980
Am I missing something I might to pick up the bomb and throw it at them without taking damage question mark

6849
08:17:36,220 --> 08:17:38,540
Huh oh well close enough. Um

6850
08:17:39,020 --> 08:17:41,020
Um

6851
08:17:41,340 --> 08:17:44,700
Now that we have the red portal we can go back and get heals

6852
08:17:46,060 --> 08:17:48,860
So it's not really a problem

6853
08:17:50,700 --> 08:17:54,460
Can I pick up bombs like chickens? I can't

6854
08:18:02,700 --> 08:18:04,700
Oh

6855
08:18:05,580 --> 08:18:11,500
I want to say let me cook but um, I tried to place a bomb on the thing and it never let me

6856
08:18:14,940 --> 08:18:18,380
Yeah, it just falls down. Can you throw one?

6857
08:18:20,060 --> 08:18:25,900
Can I throw a bomb from above? I think no the bomb's gonna stay up on that top level

6858
08:18:27,980 --> 08:18:31,420
Oh wait, can I drop a bomb and throw it? Oh for fuck's sake

6859
08:18:31,980 --> 08:18:35,180
Wait because they don't explode on impact

6860
08:18:46,060 --> 08:18:48,060
That can't be right

6861
08:18:49,500 --> 08:18:51,500
And I can't place one on the tail

6862
08:18:54,140 --> 08:18:56,940
You've got a tamer I can't tame it. I don't have tamed bombs

6863
08:18:57,900 --> 08:19:02,540
Maybe it's just timing on the platform like I can stand on it and it just

6864
08:19:03,660 --> 08:19:07,020
Like luckily I have 85 but like there's no

6865
08:19:09,180 --> 08:19:15,740
You know what you know what game making a they're making a mockery at me ring the guards ring the guards

6866
08:19:17,020 --> 08:19:19,020
The guards are to be rang

6867
08:19:20,300 --> 08:19:22,300
Making an absolute mockery out of me

6868
08:19:23,180 --> 08:19:25,980
Absolute mockery right give me these fairies right now

6869
08:19:27,740 --> 08:19:30,140
Nope, sorry, okay, I'll take that

6870
08:19:34,540 --> 08:19:38,940
That's beautiful. I'm very happy about that. Now that I know those guys heal

6871
08:19:46,220 --> 08:19:48,220
No, don't face that way then

6872
08:19:48,460 --> 08:19:50,460
Oh

6873
08:19:51,820 --> 08:19:58,620
Three damage bro, I even got three health right good thing. I have a shit ton of bombs though

6874
08:20:02,060 --> 08:20:07,260
Wait the bombs don't always necessarily work. No way. Come on. That stinks

6875
08:20:09,580 --> 08:20:11,740
It's a dark. No, I can't believe it

6876
08:20:11,820 --> 08:20:13,820
I

6877
08:20:14,060 --> 08:20:16,060
Wait, why are you being so difficult?

6878
08:20:17,500 --> 08:20:20,060
Ow, let me just kill you seriously

6879
08:20:21,980 --> 08:20:23,980
Seriously, let me just kill you. There's a problem

6880
08:20:26,780 --> 08:20:29,180
Wait, can I like throw a boomerang at space then?

6881
08:20:31,580 --> 08:20:33,820
No, I can't the boomerang does absolutely nothing

6882
08:20:35,740 --> 08:20:38,300
Is a bow and arrow do anything on the armor? Nope

6883
08:20:38,540 --> 08:20:44,860
Is that the best I can do literally just shield and hope I can get frickin whackin

6884
08:20:46,860 --> 08:20:48,860
I'm scared

6885
08:20:52,300 --> 08:20:54,300
Huh

6886
08:20:54,540 --> 08:20:56,940
Okay, there's champions in the four rooms

6887
08:20:57,980 --> 08:21:01,340
Oh, man, I'm gonna need to heal up for that one

6888
08:21:02,460 --> 08:21:04,460
Oh

6889
08:21:08,300 --> 08:21:10,300
No

6890
08:21:22,460 --> 08:21:29,740
Two in one room, where were those fairies again? Okay, they're literally right here. Thank you. I will definitely be taking the fairies

6891
08:21:31,500 --> 08:21:33,500
Thanks, I appreciate it

6892
08:21:34,460 --> 08:21:36,460
All right

6893
08:21:36,940 --> 08:21:40,220
If I apologize, I do apologize for any rage

6894
08:21:41,820 --> 08:21:43,820
Against two enemies

6895
08:21:48,940 --> 08:21:51,500
Well, I'm cornered right now. I'm gonna be honest. I'm cornered

6896
08:21:57,260 --> 08:22:01,180
Okay, these guys maybe because they swing they leave themselves open a bit more

6897
08:22:01,980 --> 08:22:06,780
No length the other way and now we've just lost our ability to

6898
08:22:08,060 --> 08:22:09,180
Uh

6899
08:22:09,180 --> 08:22:11,180
Fire

6900
08:22:12,300 --> 08:22:15,420
Hams to the best of us link. Oh, sorry. I'll put that on

6901
08:22:19,340 --> 08:22:21,100
Okay

6902
08:22:21,100 --> 08:22:23,100
that went

6903
08:22:23,100 --> 08:22:25,100
Strangely well all things considered

6904
08:22:25,820 --> 08:22:29,180
Uh, I think we're just gonna do the same tactic where we just

6905
08:22:29,660 --> 08:22:34,540
Do that and get the fairies out so I can shoot at least

6906
08:22:36,780 --> 08:22:38,780
Thank you, darling

6907
08:22:39,980 --> 08:22:44,460
I'm getting formed so literally guys. Why aren't you here to carry me? So what happens if I go up?

6908
08:22:50,780 --> 08:22:55,820
I've got like weird quest rooms to do now because they were all hiding behind doors

6909
08:22:56,380 --> 08:22:58,380
I

6910
08:22:58,860 --> 08:23:00,860
Open the door

6911
08:23:04,540 --> 08:23:06,540
What's in here? Oh

6912
08:23:07,900 --> 08:23:09,900
Well, no, I can't do my freaking laser beam

6913
08:23:11,820 --> 08:23:14,860
I didn't even hurt him. I hurt them all

6914
08:23:19,660 --> 08:23:21,660
Um

6915
08:23:22,620 --> 08:23:26,540
Oh, there's keys behind every boss room, okay

6916
08:23:29,580 --> 08:23:31,580
We need to defeat every single one

6917
08:23:34,940 --> 08:23:39,580
Just fine with me, I'm sure I'm sure can be a big girl

6918
08:23:41,660 --> 08:23:43,660
Yeah, thank god it wasn't wait

6919
08:23:44,940 --> 08:23:50,060
There's a platform there, right? I'm uh heal up fully because I like being able to shoot from my weasel or my

6920
08:23:51,900 --> 08:23:56,380
Um, sorry if it is tedious, but it's the only way I know how to play game

6921
08:23:58,380 --> 08:24:00,380
Oh my god, I can't believe it

6922
08:24:00,380 --> 08:24:02,220
A gamer that's bad at games

6923
08:24:02,220 --> 08:24:03,740
Saying so

6924
08:24:03,740 --> 08:24:08,540
I will not go kind of like so carry me home. Oh, I never sung that during the time

6925
08:24:13,660 --> 08:24:18,780
That would take me outside the castle, why would I want to go outside the castle at this point in time?

6926
08:24:18,860 --> 08:24:20,860
A shortcut

6927
08:24:30,060 --> 08:24:32,060
Oh wait, hold on hold on hold on

6928
08:24:33,100 --> 08:24:38,860
No, no, let's get this clear. No, I hate those kind of guys. I hate the ones that do the freaking

6929
08:24:42,140 --> 08:24:44,140
Yeah, you know what you're getting a bomb

6930
08:24:44,700 --> 08:24:48,140
Let's see for all change that attitude. I think okay, maybe not

6931
08:24:49,020 --> 08:24:51,740
Uh, maybe not maybe not hold on maybe we got a bit a bit too

6932
08:24:52,780 --> 08:24:54,300
over over

6933
08:24:54,300 --> 08:24:55,900
confident, um

6934
08:24:55,900 --> 08:24:57,820
honest mistake truly

6935
08:24:57,820 --> 08:25:03,420
Okay, he just swings and gets vulnerable, which I'm quite happy with but he does have that move which I do not like at all

6936
08:25:04,540 --> 08:25:06,860
Am I just let them attack?

6937
08:25:07,020 --> 08:25:14,220
Okay, okay, that's not bad. That's not bad. That's that's handle-able handle-able

6938
08:25:15,900 --> 08:25:19,260
Instant loss. No, no, no instant loss. I'm good. I promise

6939
08:25:20,220 --> 08:25:23,900
Fortunately, I'm not full health so I can't deal with all these

6940
08:25:24,460 --> 08:25:26,780
Enemies. Thank god. I've been playing Isaac

6941
08:25:27,980 --> 08:25:29,980
Uh, because yeah

6942
08:25:29,980 --> 08:25:31,980
I

6943
08:25:33,740 --> 08:25:36,140
Was a game wants me to have arrows curious

6944
08:25:38,860 --> 08:25:42,700
Oh, that's why the game wants me to have arrows. Yes, the mystery's no more

6945
08:25:43,740 --> 08:25:45,900
All right, get me away from that, please

6946
08:25:47,980 --> 08:25:49,980
Truly a mystery

6947
08:25:55,260 --> 08:25:57,260
I miss

6948
08:25:57,260 --> 08:26:00,460
Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. We made it. We got we got what we wanted

6949
08:26:02,460 --> 08:26:06,140
Had to clean the cat food bowl and I'm back. What did I miss? Um

6950
08:26:10,540 --> 08:26:12,540
Me getting rolled, um

6951
08:26:14,140 --> 08:26:17,020
So I can only go this way but I can only drop down

6952
08:26:18,060 --> 08:26:20,060
Don't go up

6953
08:26:20,620 --> 08:26:21,980
Nope

6954
08:26:21,980 --> 08:26:25,420
Nice try nice try nice try not happening

6955
08:26:28,220 --> 08:26:30,220
What's upstairs

6956
08:26:31,260 --> 08:26:33,260
Ta-da

6957
08:26:34,380 --> 08:26:37,420
Came back from walking my dog. We're still in the castle

6958
08:26:38,460 --> 08:26:41,980
Um, I've ordered food. So I'm just waiting for it to come

6959
08:26:43,340 --> 08:26:47,500
And and I'm gonna refuel because I think this boss fight is gonna be there. Oh

6960
08:26:47,500 --> 08:26:49,500
Is

6961
08:26:56,620 --> 08:26:59,500
Is this just the way to teleport out with the bird if I want it

6962
08:27:01,900 --> 08:27:03,900
I mean

6963
08:27:14,380 --> 08:27:16,700
Is there a platform coming towards me maybe

6964
08:27:18,220 --> 08:27:20,220
I

6965
08:27:26,220 --> 08:27:28,220
Am I missing

6966
08:27:36,540 --> 08:27:40,620
This just seems like a dead end and I can't go back

6967
08:27:40,620 --> 08:27:42,620
I

6968
08:27:43,260 --> 08:27:45,580
Can go back my apologies. I can go back

6969
08:27:47,020 --> 08:27:52,940
Due to my foolish. Oh, of course. Ah, lovely. Thanks for respawning. Don't ever ever come back again

6970
08:27:55,180 --> 08:27:57,180
Let us heal with the fairies

6971
08:28:00,300 --> 08:28:04,060
Map check and you go bottom left and bottom right now

6972
08:28:04,060 --> 08:28:06,060
Oh

6973
08:28:09,180 --> 08:28:12,860
Maybe check the map out there. Uh, yeah, you're actually pretty valid for that

6974
08:28:15,260 --> 08:28:17,760
Now I'm just to pick up the chest

6975
08:28:30,380 --> 08:28:32,380
Yeah, I'm to go down

6976
08:28:34,060 --> 08:28:36,060
Oh

6977
08:28:43,500 --> 08:28:49,340
What's the quay expect and I'm gonna be honest bro, my foot's gonna be here soon. Please stop leave me alone

6978
08:28:50,300 --> 08:28:56,620
You have to understand. I'm just a hungry streamer. Okay. Ow. What a fucking wingspan on that bloody sword

6979
08:28:58,060 --> 08:29:00,060
Fucking

6980
08:29:00,300 --> 08:29:02,300
Hey

6981
08:29:06,460 --> 08:29:07,580
Mate

6982
08:29:07,580 --> 08:29:11,420
Yous are actually too OP. I'm not being funny, but you guys are actually a bit too OP

6983
08:29:11,580 --> 08:29:17,660
Like I'm completely out of my depth against you two right now and you're both are doing different directions

6984
08:29:21,500 --> 08:29:23,500
Oh, come on

6985
08:29:24,060 --> 08:29:28,300
No, okay, hold on. This is going terrible. I'm gonna be honest

6986
08:29:31,020 --> 08:29:34,780
Am I not just gonna say yeah, okay, we're just gonna fuck out of themselves

6987
08:29:37,980 --> 08:29:43,660
Okay, okay, that's much more manageable one is much more manageable than two and absolutely no one is

6988
08:29:45,580 --> 08:29:47,580
Much more manageable, okay

6989
08:29:47,740 --> 08:29:53,420
Because of 1v1 this is fair. I'm literally a 12 year old boy and you're some sort of demon like this is getting a bit weird

6990
08:29:53,580 --> 08:29:56,380
Honestly, why do you want a 12 year old boy in a room with you?

6991
08:29:57,100 --> 08:29:59,100
Oh

6992
08:29:59,500 --> 08:30:01,500
Yeah, yeah, that's what

6993
08:30:03,660 --> 08:30:05,660
That's right cry to your mama

6994
08:30:08,460 --> 08:30:10,460
What are we eating today, um

6995
08:30:14,700 --> 08:30:19,500
Burger oh, that's the reason oh no logic puzzle

6996

6998
08:30:48,620 --> 08:30:50,620
Okay

6999
08:30:51,020 --> 08:30:53,020
I

7000
08:30:54,780 --> 08:31:01,900
Got the worst makes considerable time on sorry as if you just did that you weren't even aiming at me

7001
08:31:03,820 --> 08:31:05,740
Yeah, we're here

7002
08:31:05,740 --> 08:31:10,060
Again just an outside of a castle curious curious. Let's go up to the treasure

7003
08:31:11,260 --> 08:31:13,260
Yeah, there you go

7004
08:31:13,420 --> 08:31:15,420

7005
08:31:15,740 --> 08:31:18,300
Where am I with the steakhouse burger?

7006
08:31:20,620 --> 08:31:23,260

Oh no logic puzzles proceeded to do it in three seconds

7011
08:31:47,980 --> 08:31:51,980
The only reason I know how to do those kind of puzzles is because of pokemon ruby

7012
08:31:53,260 --> 08:31:56,620
There is an ace tape gem where you had to do something like that

7013
08:31:57,740 --> 08:31:59,500
and

7014
08:31:59,500 --> 08:32:03,660
And it took me so long to learn as a child one earth I was supposed to do

7015
08:32:05,900 --> 08:32:10,380
Oh, is there a heart in here? Oh, there's lovely lovely jubbly don't have to put the theme

7018
08:32:26,780 --> 08:32:32,220

7019
08:32:34,220 --> 08:32:37,660
Okay, well that ability is gone just like that

7020
08:32:40,380 --> 08:32:42,380
Oh

08:32:48,060 --> 08:32:52,540
My god, that was clean that was clean mr.

7022
08:32:55,820 --> 08:32:58,860
What's the job a four-way

7023
08:33:03,820 --> 08:33:06,700
I have no idea how I'm supposed to serve this room

7024
08:33:11,180 --> 08:33:13,180
So you think I'm skinny

7025
08:33:16,700 --> 08:33:18,700
Hold on oh that works no way

7026
08:33:22,300 --> 08:33:24,300
Oh

08:33:31,180 --> 08:33:33,180
Great up top to get the goose

7029
08:33:34,220 --> 08:33:38,860
She's getting too good at this that was incredibly lucky because of his attack pattern could have been different

7030
08:33:39,580 --> 08:33:43,580
We now have four keys. Where do we took the keys? I don't know

7031
08:33:44,860 --> 08:33:46,860
Are you gonna do a pokemon stream?

7032
08:33:48,300 --> 08:33:52,220
Let's see tomorrow the heart's covering up your message again. Is this just

7033
08:33:55,900 --> 08:33:57,900
Absolutely no comment

7034
08:33:59,820 --> 08:34:03,500
No comment whatsoever. I'm gonna go get a fairy

7035
08:34:04,380 --> 08:34:09,580
Hey, are you gonna do a pokemon streams too strong? Yes. Okay. I'm eating. I'm sorry. The heart was in the way

7036
08:34:09,660 --> 08:34:11,660
I keep forgetting to move the heart of the way

7037
08:34:14,060 --> 08:34:16,060
No that way

7038
08:34:17,100 --> 08:34:20,460
Uh, yes, I will most likely do pokemons

7039
08:34:22,300 --> 08:34:24,300
Um

7040
08:34:26,540 --> 08:34:28,700
Pokemon

7041
08:34:28,700 --> 08:34:31,180
Where's the fairy room? I think it's back up here

7042
08:34:32,140 --> 08:34:36,460
So I don't want to waste my heals just because of the dire situation

7043
08:34:36,460 --> 08:34:38,620
We're gonna be in when we actually go against the boss

7044
08:34:39,180 --> 08:34:42,460
I would much rather throw my bimmering at this thing over and over again

7045
08:34:44,540 --> 08:34:46,540
Uh

7046
08:34:46,540 --> 08:34:51,340

pear

7049
08:34:56,060 --> 08:35:01,020
Diamond and white are the generations i'm familiar with

7050
08:35:01,740 --> 08:35:04,140
There's something ahead that I couldn't get access to

7051
08:35:09,260 --> 08:35:14,220
Oh, it's literally what four the keys were four my bad

7052
08:35:19,340 --> 08:35:21,340
Yeah, they don't need jumping maybe helping

7053
08:35:23,900 --> 08:35:27,900
Which one's your favorite pokemon but my first one was three

7054
08:35:28,860 --> 08:35:33,660
So it has like a special place. Oh, no, we have the boss door key

08:35:40,060 --> 08:35:42,380
Where's the boss up here on floor three

And tar chick was so OP. Oh as soon as tar chick turns into blaziken, bro. You're OP as any of him

7062
08:36:16,140 --> 08:36:21,180
Oh, no, I don't know if I want to go in. I'm gonna have to pause if my delivery comes

7063
08:36:22,140 --> 08:36:24,140
Oh

7064
08:36:24,460 --> 08:36:26,460

08:36:35,980 --> 08:36:38,860

7071
08:36:53,900 --> 08:36:57,340
Because I know this is gonna be angry scottish mode. I can already tell

7072
08:37:19,260 --> 08:37:21,260
So

7073
08:37:49,260 --> 08:37:51,260
So

7074
08:38:20,220 --> 08:38:22,220
So

7075
08:38:34,460 --> 08:38:37,260
I hate my delivery guy went off of my can of spray

7076
08:38:41,740 --> 08:38:45,980
Well, I hope you enjoyed it because I have cola in the fridge that was lucky. I'm not region

7077
08:38:45,980 --> 08:38:47,980
Um

7078
08:38:52,220 --> 08:38:57,020
I've got my burger and it's absolutely outrageously large. I'll see one thing about Australia

7079
08:38:57,260 --> 08:39:00,380
You guys do not mess around for your food portion sizes

7080
08:39:02,380 --> 08:39:05,820
You're starting to get a bit um American

7081
08:39:07,660 --> 08:39:13,660
Hey, I don't know. I think he may have accidentally forgot to give it to me, which is fine. It's not it's literally can of spray

7082
08:39:14,620 --> 08:39:21,100
She will port it now. I'm sure he just left it in the car. I rolled out. It's fine

7083
08:39:22,620 --> 08:39:28,540
Oh my god, the chips are cheesy and they're so good. We fun. You need to take a bite. It's so good

7084
08:39:32,780 --> 08:39:38,940
I'm most laid-back customer in the world probably because I was a waitress and like I mean I fucked up. It's just happened

7085
08:39:40,220 --> 08:39:41,660
um

7086
08:39:41,660 --> 08:39:44,940
You know, I've never had anyone be I'm gonna report you to your boss or whatever

7087
08:39:45,820 --> 08:39:48,140
Meanwhile, my boss is literally always on my side

7088
08:39:53,580 --> 08:39:55,580
Chips like chips

7089
08:39:58,700 --> 08:40:03,420
Like chips like I'm made of a potato and deep-fried

7090
08:40:07,580 --> 08:40:09,580
But cheese

7091
08:40:12,620 --> 08:40:14,620
And

7092
08:40:17,340 --> 08:40:22,140
My place doesn't get scotland getting americanized. Do you guys ever watch beard meets food?

7093
08:40:22,140 --> 08:40:28,300
It's this guy that eats like a stupid amount of food and he travels to america to make his content

7094
08:40:28,700 --> 08:40:33,900
Because america has such large portions that are like good for sensationalizing in his videos

7095
08:40:37,260 --> 08:40:40,540
He's like I'm going to america again

7096
08:40:41,660 --> 08:40:44,780
I'm going to america again. I'm doing a tour of america

7097
08:40:52,780 --> 08:41:00,460
We do big, uh, literally the girls were telling me about american food and all the places they take me to and I'm like, oh, please kidnap me

7098
08:41:01,900 --> 08:41:04,460
I'm like such a fat bastard. I love food

7099
08:41:06,460 --> 08:41:09,340
Um, it would be nice to pick out on american food

7100
08:41:12,540 --> 08:41:14,700
Hmm and like

7101
08:41:18,220 --> 08:41:25,340
I I think the mexican food would be better in america because you'll never guess what's next to america. Mexico crazy. I know right?

7102
08:41:26,140 --> 08:41:27,820
um

7103
08:41:27,820 --> 08:41:29,740
and uh

7104
08:41:29,740 --> 08:41:33,100
But apparently street vendors are like a lot more popular

7105
08:41:35,420 --> 08:41:40,460
And I love me some I think they're called dirty tackles if they're from a street vendor and I'm like fuck. Yeah

7106
08:41:40,460 --> 08:41:42,460
That's like my kind of food

7107
08:41:44,940 --> 08:41:47,900
American mexicans actually pretty bad. Oh, no

7108
08:41:48,700 --> 08:41:51,340
Oh, no, only the mexican food is good in Mexico. No

7109
08:41:52,780 --> 08:41:55,100
I thought because it's literally land connected

7110
08:41:57,580 --> 08:42:01,420
Yeah, be good. They are like a taco truck. I'd absolutely die for a taco truck

7111
08:42:03,100 --> 08:42:05,260
Um, there's like no street vendors

7112
08:42:06,060 --> 08:42:07,980
Are hardly any

7113
08:42:07,980 --> 08:42:13,020
Sorry, I'm just choking on a chip there. Excuse me. This is what happens

7114
08:42:13,580 --> 08:42:16,700
If you're talking in stream at the same time eating stream at the same time

7115
08:42:17,820 --> 08:42:20,940
Um, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Don't worry. Um

7116
08:42:22,780 --> 08:42:27,500
The the only like british takeaway pop-up shop

08:42:28,220 --> 08:42:33,580
I can think of is a fucking potato a baked potato van thing

7118
08:42:33,740 --> 08:42:37,260

Like takeaway thing truck is a freaking baked potato stand, which is hilarious

7120
08:42:47,500 --> 08:42:49,500
Well

7121
08:42:49,740 --> 08:42:54,700
If you're east of mississippi, you can forget about authentic mexican food. No

7122
08:42:58,060 --> 08:43:03,420
They put beans on the baked beans and potato and baked potatoes absolutely delicious

7123
08:43:03,820 --> 08:43:05,820
Right, let's take a break of this

7124
08:43:05,980 --> 08:43:12,700
Bait of this breakfast burger. Um, it's got an egg on it baking on it hash brown on it. Oh

08:43:29,740 --> 08:43:31,740
It's

7128
08:43:33,260 --> 08:43:39,180
Jacket potatoes. Oh, we can't be potatoes. You come jacket potatoes because they're in a jacket. Yeah

7129
08:43:40,140 --> 08:43:42,140
Oh my god, the egg is running

08:43:50,220 --> 08:43:52,220

7131
08:43:53,900 --> 08:43:58,780
Oh, no, this can't be I don't think I like it that much but the chips were delicious though

7132
08:43:59,900 --> 08:44:01,900
Oh

7133
08:44:05,820 --> 08:44:09,100
They put something funny tasting in it. I didn't care what it is

7134
08:44:12,620 --> 08:44:15,100
What's that flavor I have no idea

7135
08:44:20,380 --> 08:44:25,180
I'm like continue to eat it anyway because I'm a fat bastard but I have no clue what it is

7136
08:44:25,740 --> 08:44:27,740

7139
08:44:45,500 --> 08:44:47,500
I

7140
08:44:50,620 --> 08:44:52,620
Sorry being fat as well

7141
08:44:54,460 --> 08:44:58,300
I'm definitely gonna do an eating. Oh, what the fuck is that?

7142
08:44:59,820 --> 08:45:03,100
It's great. Oh my god. They put like avocado

7143
08:45:04,700 --> 08:45:11,100
On the top of the burger. No wonder. Oh my god. It's a breakfast burger because it's fucking astralian

7144
08:45:11,420 --> 08:45:18,060
They've put smashed avocado on the top of it. No wonder that was tasting weird. I'm like, where's my fucking

7145
08:45:18,940 --> 08:45:21,340

7146
08:45:23,100 --> 08:45:25,100
Green

7147
08:45:26,860 --> 08:45:28,860
There's your Mexican food

7148
08:45:28,860 --> 08:45:31,820
No, I do like avocado, but this is like

7149
08:45:32,620 --> 08:45:38,140
On a savory burger and the avocado is like a whole different like palate

7150
08:45:41,980 --> 08:45:46,060
Mm-hmm that makes sense. I was like, what the fuck am I tasting?

7151
08:45:48,140 --> 08:45:54,700
I like the way she says avocado. What? How'd you say it? Avocado? Avocado?

7152
08:45:59,260 --> 08:46:03,180
I hate surprise avocado. I didn't realize it came on the burger

7153
08:46:06,540 --> 08:46:10,460
Yeah, they could go a bit confused literally supposed to be a savory break breakfast burger

7154
08:46:10,780 --> 08:46:18,700
Oh, I will say, you know the memes about Australians going nuts for avocado toast. It's kind of true. I'm sorry. It's kind of true

7155
08:46:23,420 --> 08:46:25,420
You say it normally

7156
08:46:25,420 --> 08:46:27,420
Free shavakado

7157
08:46:27,420 --> 08:46:29,420
Avocado

7158
08:46:29,420 --> 08:46:31,420
Avocado

7159
08:46:32,460 --> 08:46:34,220
Shivakado

7160
08:46:34,220 --> 08:46:36,220
It sounds like a spell

7161
08:46:36,460 --> 08:46:39,020
It sounds like a spelled way. I say avocado

7162
08:46:39,980 --> 08:46:43,180
Avocado! Oh, no, it does actually sound like a spell

7163
08:46:45,500 --> 08:46:47,500
Take that Voldemort avocado

7164
08:46:50,540 --> 08:46:52,540
I'm awful

7165
08:46:53,500 --> 08:46:56,540
Oh, it's ruining the fucking flavor

7166
08:47:01,340 --> 08:47:03,340
Avocado cadavro

7167
08:47:05,820 --> 08:47:07,820
I cast avocado

7168
08:47:09,020 --> 08:47:12,300
Right, I'm gonna have to take off the top bun that has all the fucking

7169
08:47:15,180 --> 08:47:18,700
Green on it. I'm eating now the top of the burger

7170
08:47:24,060 --> 08:47:26,060
All right, yeah, that's so much better

7171
08:47:27,740 --> 08:47:29,740
Oh my god

7172
08:47:32,380 --> 08:47:34,620
Look, I don't know about you

7173
08:47:35,340 --> 08:47:37,340
But the most pleasurable

7174
08:47:38,460 --> 08:47:45,100
Non-sexual thing you can do is fucking eat a greasy ass burger when you're hungry

7175
08:47:45,980 --> 08:47:49,740
And appreciate the flavors that are swimming in your mouth, okay?

7176
08:47:53,820 --> 08:47:55,820
Is that like come on

7177
08:47:56,140 --> 08:48:01,260
You know and what other what other pleasures of the flesh that are not factual in nature

7178
08:48:02,220 --> 08:48:05,980
The sensation of falling asleep on a warm bed

7179
08:48:06,220 --> 08:48:12,940
When you know you have absolutely nothing to wake up to you don't have to go anywhere the next day you can rot and bed the next day

7180
08:48:17,740 --> 08:48:24,460
Hmm a burger releases a hundred units of dopamine which is close to an inking fest

7181
08:48:25,420 --> 08:48:27,420
Um

7182
08:48:30,300 --> 08:48:32,300
The flavor swing

7183
08:48:33,100 --> 08:48:35,100
Oh my bacon

7184
08:48:35,660 --> 08:48:39,900
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to wash my hands unfortunately because it's so greedy

7185
08:48:49,580 --> 08:48:52,220
That is gonna fuel me for this fight that's ahead

7186
08:48:53,180 --> 08:48:55,180
No, that was good. I took the

7187
08:48:56,060 --> 08:49:01,500
The green shite away get that green get that healthy green shite out my fucking burger and chips

7188
08:49:05,260 --> 08:49:07,260
Hmm

7189
08:49:07,740 --> 08:49:12,540
No, it's like grease is not like flavor on my fingers. It's just very grease

7190
08:49:15,020 --> 08:49:17,020
Grease a lightning

7191
08:49:22,220 --> 08:49:24,220
You don't like when it gets messy

7192
08:49:26,780 --> 08:49:31,260
Okay, give me one second the bathroom's literally just right there. So

7193
08:49:32,380 --> 08:49:34,380
I'll be back in a moment second

7194
08:49:52,940 --> 08:49:54,940
You

7195
08:49:55,340 --> 08:49:57,340
You

7196
08:49:57,340 --> 08:49:59,340
You

7197
08:50:00,300 --> 08:50:02,300
You

7198
08:50:20,620 --> 08:50:23,740
Okay, my belly is full of meat

7199
08:50:24,380 --> 08:50:27,820
I have my reeflings to support me through this game

7200
08:50:28,460 --> 08:50:34,380
I just want to warn anyone that mere season 10 minutes probably and even the box fight god damn

7201
08:50:39,340 --> 08:50:41,740
I was gone for so long. Let me you don't have to make it up to me

7202
08:50:44,620 --> 08:50:46,620
Okay

7203
08:50:46,780 --> 08:50:48,780
What

7204
08:50:48,780 --> 08:50:54,700
Whoa, here has a screensaver mode. I'm a cut off is my hypnosis. You're not to attack me when I'm asleep. Okay

7205
08:50:56,460 --> 08:50:58,460
Architects

7206
08:50:59,180 --> 08:51:01,180
Calling all

7207
08:51:03,420 --> 08:51:10,220
Let's get this. Oh, thank god. I walked out. Holy crap. You are persistent, aren't you? I am

7208
08:51:10,700 --> 08:51:12,700
He he he he

7209
08:51:12,780 --> 08:51:16,380
So you've come to stop my little ceremony while you're too late

7210
08:51:16,860 --> 08:51:21,580
A mere three more times of the bell will bring the ceremony to its end

7211
08:51:22,300 --> 08:51:27,100
And with the third toll of the bell, I will become like a god

7212
08:51:28,060 --> 08:51:32,300
And your precious princess Zelda will be nothing more than a cold

7213
08:51:33,260 --> 08:51:35,260
dead stone

7214
08:51:36,220 --> 08:51:38,220
There's no time quickly link to the ring

7215
08:51:41,180 --> 08:51:43,660
To the roof to the roof. I don't have time for your games

7216
08:51:48,380 --> 08:51:54,940
Did you hear that link hurry? There's only two times left. Wait. Am I actually being timed or am I being trolled?

7217
08:51:57,020 --> 08:52:00,780
Am I being timed like I'm actually being timed hold on someone look it up. Am I being timed?

7218
08:52:04,940 --> 08:52:07,820
Holy shit, right fuck it just do the swords and slash them

7219
08:52:11,180 --> 08:52:13,180
Holy shit

7220
08:52:16,300 --> 08:52:22,940
Get out the way get out the way. No, you don't need to pick up the freaking Kenstone piece. Holy shit. We're in a timer, bro

7221
08:52:25,180 --> 08:52:26,940
Oh god

7222
08:52:26,940 --> 08:52:30,460
Another bell is no no and right. It's a progression. It's a progress

7223
08:52:33,420 --> 08:52:35,420
It's fine

7224
08:52:40,540 --> 08:52:42,540
Oh

7225
08:52:46,700 --> 08:52:53,340
Doesn't matter who I hit doesn't matter if I'm wasting bombs as long as I'm hitting someone bro as long as I'm hitting someone

7226
08:52:58,700 --> 08:53:05,020
Doesn't matter doesn't matter honestly doesn't matter. I have fairies as well. I have fairies as well. Don't worry. I have fairies. I have time. I have time

7227
08:53:05,980 --> 08:53:14,300
As soon as one goes down everything becomes 10 times easier. That's it. That's the truth as soon as one goes down

7228
08:53:14,940 --> 08:53:16,940
One down. That's it. See

7229
08:53:18,700 --> 08:53:20,700
All right, I'm gonna need to

7230
08:53:21,740 --> 08:53:23,420
Okay, see

7231
08:53:23,420 --> 08:53:29,420
That's fine. That's fine. Not problem. I wouldn't mind that. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Uh, sorry. I know I'm gonna I'm gonna fight with you and all that

7232
08:53:29,420 --> 08:53:30,780
but

7233
08:53:30,780 --> 08:53:35,180
Okay, he recovers far too quickly. So we're gonna just have to go for the old uh whack him

7234
08:53:35,980 --> 08:53:38,140
Like that. Yeah, oh that's so good

7235
08:53:38,940 --> 08:53:44,140
Whoa, this guy's fast. He's like really he's hardly given me a chance to breathe

7236
08:53:45,740 --> 08:53:50,140
Okay, okay, let's go. Can I get hearts? Yes, absolutely would love some hearts

7237
08:53:51,500 --> 08:53:53,500
I would love to have

7238
08:53:53,580 --> 08:53:58,460
Fucking thingy, but it's fine. Doesn't matter. All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

7239
08:54:01,740 --> 08:54:07,580
Oh, this looks like a boss fight if I've ever seen one. Hold on. I need to roll my shoulders for this

7240
08:54:07,660 --> 08:54:09,820
You're welcome to roll your shoulders with me

7241
08:54:11,900 --> 08:54:14,700
Oh, I'm taking a drink of cola. I'm feeling nervous

7242
08:54:17,020 --> 08:54:21,100
Just a few more moments in the ceremony would have been complete

7243
08:54:21,580 --> 08:54:23,980
You really are obsessed with stopping me, aren't you?

7244
08:54:24,620 --> 08:54:29,340
Very well. I have not yet drained all of the light force housed in princess Zelda

7245
08:54:29,340 --> 08:54:35,820
But what I should have should suffice. I shall be transformed unstoppable

7246
08:54:36,140 --> 08:54:40,140
But let me first attend to the pesky worms who would trifle with me

7247
08:54:40,220 --> 08:54:42,700
Well, if I'm a worm, you're about to get wrecked by me

7248
08:54:43,340 --> 08:54:45,340
By a wiggly worm

7249
08:54:46,380 --> 08:54:49,500
I'm in the glory hole. No, what? I just finished the fight

7250
08:54:52,140 --> 08:54:54,140
Huh

7251
08:54:54,620 --> 08:55:00,300
I will have no more of your interfering with my plans. Let me show you my true power

7252
08:55:00,380 --> 08:55:06,300
Monkaos is a boss fight in this tiny-ass room. Am I about to fight a master bath boss in a tiny-ass room?

7253
08:55:08,780 --> 08:55:10,780
What the hell even is that?

7254
08:55:13,020 --> 08:55:15,020
Um, um

7255
08:55:15,900 --> 08:55:18,220
Um, um, um suck them suck them

7256
08:55:19,740 --> 08:55:22,140
I'm sucking. I'm sucking. I'm sucking

7257
08:55:22,700 --> 08:55:26,060
Um, what am I to do? Am I to throw boomerangs?

7258
08:55:27,020 --> 08:55:31,820
Nope, not boomerangs. Oh, right. Just twat them. Just twat them. It's fine. Just twat them when they go around the room

7259
08:55:32,940 --> 08:55:37,100
Okay, that's fine. Not interested. Not interested. Not interested

7260
08:55:38,220 --> 08:55:45,100
Okay, just twat it. I take that. Yeah, you like that right and then what looks like her eyeball is open. He his eyeball. Sorry

7261
08:55:46,380 --> 08:55:48,380
Let's not make gender in this day and age

7262
08:55:49,340 --> 08:55:55,900
Okay, that did something. I don't know what something's happening. I can hardly see I need to get close to see what the fuck

7263
08:55:55,900 --> 08:55:58,540
I'm supposed to be hitting. Where's the other one?

7264
08:55:59,180 --> 08:56:03,500
Take that. Yeah. Yeah, you're quivering. Your little boots are shaking. Yeah, take that. Oh

7265
08:56:04,540 --> 08:56:07,660
What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna respond some more for me? Yeah. Yeah

7266
08:56:09,980 --> 08:56:14,300
Oh, you don't like it. Oh, oh your little eyeball doesn't like it. You're too you're quaking

7267
08:56:15,260 --> 08:56:19,100
I'm fucking scared. I'm not gonna lie. Uh, am I doing this right? I don't think I'm doing this right

7268
08:56:21,260 --> 08:56:25,500
Oh, I can I can hit it. I can hit it. Okay. Is your problem? I can actually hit it for damage

7269
08:56:26,300 --> 08:56:30,780
Okay, okay. We're we've got four balls now. We've got four balls. That's an upgrade. That's an upgrade. That's an upgrade

7270
08:56:31,020 --> 08:56:34,140
That's a difference. We're sniping it. Could you imagine if I hit that?

7271
08:56:37,100 --> 08:56:41,580
Okay, okay, sorry, uh, let me just grab. Oh, no. Okay, great. That was ahead

7272
08:56:42,540 --> 08:56:44,540
I'm a fucking oh

7273
08:56:45,100 --> 08:56:48,940
I'm a firing the laser. That's fine. You're allowed to do that. It's fine. You're allowed to have a laser beam

7274
08:56:49,020 --> 08:56:51,580
Like I have a I have a few items that you don't have so it's fine

7275
08:56:52,380 --> 08:56:55,180
Whoa, where did it go? Don't do that

7276
08:56:56,460 --> 08:56:58,460
Don't do that. Don't do that

7277
08:56:58,700 --> 08:57:00,700
Don't do that. That's so nice

7278
08:57:02,140 --> 08:57:05,740
Okay, okay, get twired get twired get twired get twired. Oh

7279
08:57:07,260 --> 08:57:08,620
Okay

Okay, take it easy

7281
08:57:10,540 --> 08:57:14,860
No, it's fine. Take it get twired get twired. Nope miss. It's fine. I'm allowed to miss

7282
08:57:15,660 --> 08:57:17,660
Oh, I get to that

7283
08:57:17,980 --> 08:57:19,500
Oh, no

7284
08:57:19,500 --> 08:57:21,500
No, just quaking in your little boots

7285
08:57:23,420 --> 08:57:27,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Danny suck those away. I do not like to look those

7286
08:57:27,980 --> 08:57:33,500
I do. Oh my god. They have a fucking invincibility slope right spin right now so I can get the other two, right?

7287
08:57:33,500 --> 08:57:35,500
That's fine. That's fine. I can tolerate that

7288
08:57:35,580 --> 08:57:41,900
Okay, I can't tolerate that though. That's HP damage again with the damage again with the damage

7289
08:57:43,340 --> 08:57:46,700
So much so unkind so unruly

7290
08:57:49,100 --> 08:57:55,900
Again, I can't be making mistakes like this. I do have three fairies, but I cannot be making damage mistakes like that

7291
08:57:56,300 --> 08:57:58,300
Oh lovely. I can't even reach you

7292
08:57:58,380 --> 08:58:00,380
That's fine. I didn't want to reach you anywhere

7293
08:58:00,940 --> 08:58:03,180
Come here. Oh not again

7294
08:58:03,420 --> 08:58:05,420
Okay, that's fine

7295
08:58:09,420 --> 08:58:16,140
Link, I know your arse is on fire and it hurts so badly, but I'm gonna have to ask you to please stop taking damage

7296
08:58:16,140 --> 08:58:20,300
Darlin link. We're trying to save Zelda and I do not I

7297
08:58:22,060 --> 08:58:24,940
I do not have infinity. Oh my god. There was a fairy in the jar

7298
08:58:25,740 --> 08:58:27,740
We love fairy we love

7299
08:58:30,140 --> 08:58:32,140
Okay, perfect

7300
08:58:34,140 --> 08:58:36,780
I was gonna say let's not get hit by the fire

7301
08:58:37,980 --> 08:58:42,620
I have to deal with that, but I don't have a choice. Miss. That's fine

7302
08:58:44,860 --> 08:58:46,860
I just couldn't even get hit in

7303
08:58:48,140 --> 08:58:52,460
Okay, hold on. No, we didn't get it. Oh piss

7304
08:58:52,940 --> 08:58:58,140
Well, you seem to have some fight in you. I commend your bravery, but you will not survive this

7305
08:58:58,700 --> 08:59:00,700
Oh

7306
08:59:01,260 --> 08:59:05,900
God girl, I'm filled with the power. Okay, hold on hydration check

7307
08:59:08,860 --> 08:59:14,140
I'm filled with the power that you cannot begin to understand. Do you think that puny sword will save you from me?

7308
08:59:18,940 --> 08:59:22,860
Um no is my answer

7309
08:59:22,860 --> 08:59:24,860
Uh

7310
08:59:26,380 --> 08:59:29,980
No, I do not think the puny sword will save me but

7311
08:59:30,620 --> 08:59:32,620
Does it mean I'm not that I suck them up

7312
08:59:33,420 --> 08:59:35,420
I don't suck them up

7313
08:59:36,140 --> 08:59:38,140
Oh

7314
08:59:39,580 --> 08:59:41,580
I can't do any oh I can

7315
08:59:42,300 --> 08:59:45,580
They're cobble wobbles. They're cobwebs. It's fine. They're cobwebs

7316
08:59:47,260 --> 08:59:49,260
I can deal with cobwebs

7317
08:59:49,260 --> 08:59:54,940
All right, let's just spin. Let's just clear up the map. Let's just clear up the map so we don't really have any issues

7318
08:59:56,860 --> 09:00:01,820
What's the dealio? What's the plan? What's the deal? What's the plan? I don't know

7319
09:00:02,460 --> 09:00:08,220
I clearly have to make their eye shape, but you're not transforming for me big batty

7320
09:00:10,220 --> 09:00:12,220
But electroshock that's fine

7321
09:00:16,780 --> 09:00:18,780
Again

7322
09:00:19,980 --> 09:00:22,620
I mean, I'll clean them up

7323
09:00:37,500 --> 09:00:41,500
Can I get help from these as well? Possibly. Am I to shoot it in the eyeball?

7324
09:00:43,260 --> 09:00:48,460
Must be because you're not doing anything about it. Like you're honestly just kiss arse about no you are

7325
09:00:49,340 --> 09:00:51,340
I

7326
09:00:51,660 --> 09:00:53,660
That's it. That's my window of opportunity

7327
09:00:57,260 --> 09:00:59,260
Oh

7328
09:01:03,660 --> 09:01:05,660
Is this a joke or

7329
09:01:09,020 --> 09:01:11,020
Lovely no do that again

7330
09:01:13,420 --> 09:01:15,420
I think I'm getting trolled I can't tell

7331
09:01:16,780 --> 09:01:18,780
I mean, it's red

7332
09:01:18,940 --> 09:01:23,260
Is it is it narrow? Nope. I'm looking short

7333
09:01:29,900 --> 09:01:31,900
I'm looking short for that

7334
09:01:35,820 --> 09:01:37,820
I might have to reach out, give me

7335
09:01:49,020 --> 09:01:51,340
Hmm I think I'm missing something

7336
09:02:01,020 --> 09:02:05,900
Shoot at the ball feigned all the eyes it flashes for a frame when you hit it. I think

7337
09:02:06,860 --> 09:02:11,020
Shooting the closed eyes opens them reveal which eye

7338
09:02:11,980 --> 09:02:13,980
Oh

7339
09:02:14,060 --> 09:02:19,180
Oh wasted all that time my apologies my apologies. Sorry. I don't need to waste your time

7340
09:02:20,140 --> 09:02:22,140
Okay, we understand we understand

7341
09:02:23,260 --> 09:02:25,260
So a few mechanics to learn that's

7342
09:02:25,820 --> 09:02:29,340
Right, okay, we understand we have to hit all four. That's perfectly fine, right?

7343
09:02:30,300 --> 09:02:32,300
Can we do it in time?

7344
09:02:33,020 --> 09:02:35,020
Oh, we absolutely can ladies and gentlemen

7345
09:02:35,420 --> 09:02:42,700
Okay, okay, okay, that's perfectly fine that makes sense why they keep spawning

7346
09:02:43,260 --> 09:02:50,860
No, it's four bottom again. That's perfectly fine. Okay. Thank you. Sorry for your patience. Thank you for your patience. Sorry for um

7347
09:02:52,220 --> 09:02:56,620
Uh taking my time. Uh, it's sorry. I said that the wrong word, you know

09:02:58,460 --> 09:03:03,580
Okay, absolutely absolutely loving it. Okay. We're on fire. We're cooking by gas

7349
09:03:03,580 --> 09:03:11,260
We are gonna have to clear up this map over. Oh, that was unfortunate unfortunate hit did not mean that uh, very unfortunate

7350
09:03:12,620 --> 09:03:15,660
Uh, right. I can see what one we're supposed to hit next

7351
09:03:16,780 --> 09:03:21,100
Oh, oh dear unfortunately, um, I'm just gonna clear the map if

7352
09:03:22,220 --> 09:03:29,580
Because it's getting a bit crowded and that is currently stuck to the right side and I actually need to shoot something on the right side

7353
09:03:29,900 --> 09:03:31,900
All right, there we go

7354
09:03:32,860 --> 09:03:34,860
There we go. There we go. Okay

7355
09:03:35,660 --> 09:03:37,660
All right, sweet. Oh, I can't

7356
09:03:38,460 --> 09:03:40,460
Do it if you're doing your electoral shot

7357
09:03:44,540 --> 09:03:46,380
Okay

7358
09:03:46,380 --> 09:03:52,700

7360
09:03:56,700 --> 09:03:58,220
Um, I'm not

7361
09:03:59,100 --> 09:04:04,220
Moving fast now. I think we're in us. We're in a phase. We must be in a further phase

7362
09:04:05,340 --> 09:04:07,340
Because that's outrageous as fast

7363
09:04:07,660 --> 09:04:12,620
But lovely. Um, not really looking for that please don't do that again question mark

7364
09:04:19,100 --> 09:04:21,100
What are we doing? What are we looking at?

7365
09:04:21,260 --> 09:04:27,740
Not that side top maybe no bottom. Yeah. No. Wow all right side. Okay. We can handle that

7366
09:04:27,980 --> 09:04:32,220
Yeah, that is moving so fast now like so fast. Sorry. I'm gonna have to clear this up a bit

7367
09:04:32,860 --> 09:04:36,140
Just doing a bit of spring cleaning than you might need me to get spring cleaning

7368
09:04:36,700 --> 09:04:39,100
Most we're just uh getting me that ideal

7369
09:04:39,900 --> 09:04:41,500
I'm missing

7370
09:04:41,500 --> 09:04:44,940
I am missing like nothing on air. I'm fully moley. Holy moley

7371
09:04:45,580 --> 09:04:49,980
Wow, I actually just took a bit of a hammering. I'm tempted to try a fairy

7372
09:04:50,860 --> 09:04:57,580
I am very tempted to try a fairy. Thank you very much. Love you. Please come all the time. Um to me

7373
09:04:57,820 --> 09:04:59,820
Because that was very cringey

7374
09:05:00,780 --> 09:05:01,900
Um

7375
09:05:01,900 --> 09:05:03,020
Mate

7376
09:05:03,020 --> 09:05:07,420
I really don't want vati to be on that side of me when I spawn. Yes. That's what I did

7377
09:05:13,420 --> 09:05:15,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

7378
09:05:17,020 --> 09:05:25,180
What what is this madness? I have the power of a god. I haven't stoppable mate. How can I lose to a literal child?

7379
09:05:26,140 --> 09:05:29,980
There you go. Let's not be a just out here. Okay, children have a lot of potential

7380
09:05:30,940 --> 09:05:36,620
We did it. Wait, did we actually do it? You did it impressive. Now quickly. We must break the curse on zelda

7381
09:05:36,620 --> 09:05:40,780
I'm is that actually done or is there more because I'm scared. There's like a secret boss

7382
09:05:42,540 --> 09:05:46,620
Hi, so like this is use it on zelda. Absolutely

7383

7385
09:05:55,900 --> 09:05:57,900
Princess

7386
09:06:07,580 --> 09:06:11,180
It looks like the curse has been broken. I'm glad we made it in time

7387
09:06:15,660 --> 09:06:20,460
No, the castle's collapsing. It's too dangerous here quickly. We must escape from the castle

7388
09:06:22,220 --> 09:06:25,580
Oh my god, I think we actually did do it. Wait for real for real. We did it first try

7389
09:06:26,140 --> 09:06:29,740
Hmm. The door is blocked. We have no choice head back to the sanctuary

7390
09:06:31,260 --> 09:06:35,820
What is the sanctuary? Is it to the right? No, sorry. Uh, yeah, yeah sanctuary sanctuary. Yes

No, you will see the true power of the light force for I have become batty the master of this world

7400
09:07:16,700 --> 09:07:18,700
I knew it

09:07:18,700 --> 09:07:22,380
I knew it. That was I I succeeded too well

7402
09:07:23,260 --> 09:07:27,660
I succeeded too well. Holy shit. I succeeded too well

7403
09:07:29,180 --> 09:07:31,180
I succeeded too well

7404
09:07:34,940 --> 09:07:37,020
What the fubber knock is this?

7405
09:07:39,420 --> 09:07:41,420
Um

7406
09:07:42,860 --> 09:07:44,860
What is this I don't know

7407
09:07:45,420 --> 09:07:49,420
I don't know. I can become a minish

7408
09:07:50,940 --> 09:07:52,940
Which is fine

7409
09:07:53,740 --> 09:07:57,740
Well, I'm cornered now, aren't I? Oh, well, you know what I give up. You can have her

7410
09:07:59,420 --> 09:08:01,980
Nope, not that definitely not that. Um

7411
09:08:03,180 --> 09:08:07,980
What the fuck am I supposed to do to help? What do I do? What do I do? I don't know what to do

7412
09:08:09,980 --> 09:08:14,460
Suffering from she kicked too hard. What a kill boss. He's got arms, but I did oh

09:08:40,380 --> 09:08:42,380

7419
09:08:42,780 --> 09:08:44,780
I'm to destroy them all

7420
09:08:45,820 --> 09:08:49,340
No, one is not like the others this one's not like the others

7421
09:08:51,900 --> 09:08:53,900
You look different you must perish

7422
09:08:56,700 --> 09:09:01,980
Okay, get out get out so we don't get hurt did that destroy the arm it did it did it did right?

7423
09:09:01,980 --> 09:09:05,740
I have two fairies. I'm a bit nervous not gonna lie. I am very low

7424
09:09:07,660 --> 09:09:12,940
Oh fuck off with the fucking like this tick health taking not good

7425
09:09:14,940 --> 09:09:16,940
Oh god, can I do it?

7426
09:09:18,460 --> 09:09:27,340
I rolled over dear dear little long. I know you're a young child. Oh lord. I can't see a dying thing

7427
09:09:27,420 --> 09:09:29,420
Where's the one that doesn't look like him? You

7428
09:09:33,260 --> 09:09:35,020
Sometimes

7429
09:09:35,020 --> 09:09:37,020
sometimes

7430
09:09:37,020 --> 09:09:39,500
Oh, that was so lucky. I came across that like instantly

7431
09:09:40,380 --> 09:09:42,380
Oh god, what now?

7432
09:09:43,340 --> 09:09:46,620
Don't whack them all. I'm I'm sorry. I think I'm gonna have to dump the fairy

7433
09:09:47,740 --> 09:09:50,300
Oh, if we're gonna stick with even have full health for the last one though

7434
09:09:51,180 --> 09:09:53,180
Even if I use the last fairy

7435
09:09:53,420 --> 09:09:55,660
Is it triple time? I think I'm gonna be triple time

7436
09:09:57,420 --> 09:10:02,380
Oh my god, it's a deflect. It's a deflect. I can see it. I can see the attack pattern. It's a deflect

7437
09:10:04,460 --> 09:10:06,460
Oh lord

7438
09:10:06,700 --> 09:10:11,900
It's a deflect. It's a deflect. It's a deflect. Nope. Not if you're gonna do that

7439
09:10:12,540 --> 09:10:16,060
Not if you're gonna do that yet. That was so unlucky

7440
09:10:17,100 --> 09:10:19,100
Because of that attack phase. I couldn't do it

7441
09:10:20,380 --> 09:10:22,380
Again with this attack

7442
09:10:28,220 --> 09:10:32,140
Oh, I cannot press that button any harder if I tried

7443
09:10:37,100 --> 09:10:39,100
I don't I don't know what to do

7444
09:10:39,820 --> 09:10:41,820
Okay, that's fine

7445
09:10:45,420 --> 09:10:50,860
Oh, why why why I'm point blank, you know, I'm point blank. You're a wee liar

7446
09:10:52,460 --> 09:10:54,460
I'm out of time

7447
09:10:55,500 --> 09:10:57,500
Oh, you fucking pisser

7448
09:11:00,300 --> 09:11:05,020
Absolute shit for brains who knew exactly what I'm not I can't do it because I'm gonna get hit by that electrode

7449
09:11:09,260 --> 09:11:13,660
I didn't even call it a boss battle for nothing

7450
09:11:30,060 --> 09:11:32,060
Oh no, I'm not ready

7451
09:11:33,020 --> 09:11:35,020
But I don't have to be

7452
09:11:35,020 --> 09:11:37,020
I don't have to be first try

7453
09:11:37,500 --> 09:11:40,940
Fool but I the light forced my power. I had such power

7454
09:11:42,380 --> 09:11:44,380
Did we do it first try?

7455
09:11:46,700 --> 09:11:49,980
Actual gg or real gg like real gg

7456
09:11:51,740 --> 09:11:56,300
Real gg the hat has returned real gg real gg

7457
09:12:00,780 --> 09:12:02,780
Real gg

7458
09:12:03,740 --> 09:12:05,740
Link thank goodness you're safe

7459
09:12:06,620 --> 09:12:12,700
You defeated body. You're so brave, but we've lost so much the castle all those people

7460
09:12:13,740 --> 09:12:17,420
Not any worry about it. No, I try my best any worry about it

7461
09:12:17,820 --> 09:12:19,820
Ah

7462
09:12:27,900 --> 09:12:33,340
What's this the curse defeating batty seems to have broken the curse he cast upon me

7463
09:12:35,180 --> 09:12:43,660
Allow me to introduce myself to you princess Zelda. My name is Ezwo master of minish lore and sorcery

7464
09:12:44,620 --> 09:12:51,180
The mages cap was my creation, but it's limitless power has caused nothing but trouble for your kind

7465
09:12:52,780 --> 09:12:55,500
Is there any way that you can forgive me?

7466
09:12:56,540 --> 09:13:00,700
I know many have fallen and much of the castle has been destroyed

7467
09:13:01,580 --> 09:13:04,060
But it is too soon to give in to despair

7468
09:13:05,100 --> 09:13:09,820
The curse on me is broken and Zelda still possesses some of the light force

7469
09:13:10,700 --> 09:13:14,060
Perhaps together we can do something to make things right

7470
09:13:17,260 --> 09:13:20,060
Focus focus through that piece on your focus

7471
09:13:21,900 --> 09:13:25,420
If one sorry if one wears

7472
09:13:26,300 --> 09:13:31,580
If one with a just heart wears this cap things can be made right again

7473
09:13:32,540 --> 09:13:36,060
Princess Zelda let your wishes be made real

7474
09:13:40,060 --> 09:13:42,700
I was gonna say focus focus through the pizza on your princess

7475
09:13:49,740 --> 09:13:54,320
I wish to restore oh life as it once was

7476
09:14:10,140 --> 09:14:14,140
Oh no troublemakers on the road

7477
09:14:23,740 --> 09:14:25,740
I'll have peaceful

7478
09:14:27,340 --> 09:14:29,340
And always restored in the world

7479
09:14:30,860 --> 09:14:35,820
Look the castle all the people who had been turned to stone. They're all back to normal

7480
09:14:40,540 --> 09:14:44,300
The hat it's fallen apart. It's overflowing with the power of life

7481
09:14:45,020 --> 09:14:48,380
The hat has the power to turn the thoughts of its wearer into reality

7482
09:14:48,940 --> 09:14:53,420
Vati's heart was filled with evil and that was reflected in what he became

7483
09:14:54,940 --> 09:15:01,340
But it seems that Zelda's pure heart coupled with the hat's power has created a miracle

7484
09:15:02,140 --> 09:15:04,140
Oh

7485
09:15:04,540 --> 09:15:06,540
The portal is closing

7486
09:15:06,620 --> 09:15:09,420
Hmm. It looks like the time for us to part has come

7487
09:15:10,140 --> 09:15:14,940
The mini store opens but once every century and soon it must close

7488
09:15:15,980 --> 09:15:19,580
I must leave you both now and return to my homeland

7489
09:15:20,620 --> 09:15:22,860
I know I have caused you much suffering

7490
09:15:23,420 --> 09:15:25,820
But the evil one's power has withered

7491
09:15:26,540 --> 09:15:30,700
The power of princess Zelda herself has restored the light to Hyrule

7492
09:15:31,740 --> 09:15:37,660
Well Link my journey with you has been exciting to say the least

7493
09:15:38,620 --> 09:15:43,100
In fact, I'm more than just a little sad that we most part ways now

7494
09:15:45,420 --> 09:15:47,420
Please accept this

7495
09:15:51,660 --> 09:15:53,660
Oh, but it's not as low

7496
09:15:54,540 --> 09:16:07,020
You know, I've never actually seen you wear in a cap until now. It suits you little hero. Take care

7497
09:16:09,420 --> 09:16:11,180
Bye

7498
09:16:11,180 --> 09:16:14,460
Thank you for the advice. Oh god. You're so tiny. Please be careful. I thought

7499
09:16:15,420 --> 09:16:17,420
Bye buddy

7500
09:16:17,740 --> 09:16:20,300
Farewell farewell my friend

7501
09:16:21,260 --> 09:16:23,260
That's crazy small

7502
09:16:31,820 --> 09:16:37,500
There he is a proud boy link we did it

7503
09:16:40,060 --> 09:16:42,060
We did it

7504
09:16:42,780 --> 09:16:44,780
He's

7505
09:16:45,740 --> 09:16:50,300
Yeah, I don't know how big this team was but Matt hats off to this team

7506
09:16:50,460 --> 09:16:54,460
The only thing they messed up on was in my opinion

7507
09:16:56,380 --> 09:16:57,500
Was

7508
09:16:57,500 --> 09:16:59,500
The ending should remain

7509
09:16:59,580 --> 09:17:05,660
But I'm gonna show you something if I put up the game again. He's so small. He's five two. Whoa. Is there anyone?

7510
09:17:06,700 --> 09:17:14,140
And now we only have 40 more games left in the timeline. Wait, there's 40 installments of Zelda. No way

7511
09:17:15,660 --> 09:17:21,740
That's off. Yeah, okay. Actually, I didn't mean that hats off to the development team

7512
09:17:29,180 --> 09:17:31,180
Sad thing, yes

7513
09:17:31,980 --> 09:17:33,980
Broly legend

7514
09:17:33,980 --> 09:17:35,980
You did amazing

7515
09:17:36,140 --> 09:17:39,660
Thank you. Love you. Love you. Timmy's playing

7516
09:17:39,660 --> 09:17:46,700
Is it like 15 mainline games? I did not know there was that many installments

7517
09:17:49,420 --> 09:17:55,260
I know ocarina of time is rated very highly I believe. Oh my god. That's what they look like

7518
09:17:56,540 --> 09:18:03,020
They have like a little feather tail. Oh my god gen two. What the fuck they're called picori gen two confirmed

7519
09:18:03,580 --> 09:18:05,980
Little red and green inspiration little gold

7520
09:18:06,940 --> 09:18:15,180
I'm here for a little adorable tail just yonking it straight from your nintendo. Thanks. I don't even have to think

7521
09:18:18,460 --> 09:18:19,820
Hmm

7522
09:18:19,820 --> 09:18:26,860
I can't believe I didn't mess that up. I thought I was gonna be in for a rage fest like replaying over and over again

7523
09:18:27,820 --> 09:18:33,100
Oh, that's what that looks like sauce, but that looks like a chick. I'm sorry. That's like an emo chick

7524
09:18:33,900 --> 09:18:35,900
But a gen two confirmed

7525
09:18:37,100 --> 09:18:41,900
Original Zelda staff. Oh, this is a special thank you to the original

7526
09:18:43,900 --> 09:18:47,900
Management nose take product management

7527
09:18:49,900 --> 09:18:56,220
Are you shouting at? Oh my god. Link's taking it on the chin as Eslo shouts at him. That's adorable

7528
09:18:56,220 --> 09:18:59,420
Link, what did you think doing making us jump in that whirlwind?

7529
09:19:00,380 --> 09:19:09,100
Oh my god, that's such a cool friggin art that puts it into perspective how absolutely terrifying it is to be a picori

7530
09:19:11,900 --> 09:19:13,900
Gender bent batty confirmed into

7531
09:19:15,660 --> 09:19:18,380
Oh my god, that's such cool artwork. Oh

7532
09:19:19,340 --> 09:19:21,500
And here we are with all our elements

7533
09:19:22,380 --> 09:19:25,180
Dusted links quest come to an end

7534
09:19:25,660 --> 09:19:30,940
But surely this is not the end of Zelda and Link's adventures in Hyrule

7535
09:19:31,980 --> 09:19:33,980
The legend will continue

7536
09:19:37,180 --> 09:19:41,100
As long as the power of light force echoes throughout the ages

7537
09:19:42,460 --> 09:19:46,620
Oh, there's a wee picori bottom right if you see him next to the fire element

7538
09:19:48,300 --> 09:19:50,300
Hold on as we clover

7539
09:19:51,420 --> 09:19:53,420
All right, ah fuck off

7540
09:19:53,420 --> 09:19:55,420
And then get bent

7541
09:19:57,820 --> 09:20:04,380
Oh my god save absolutely save because that was a lot of progress not to save please save

7542
09:20:07,340 --> 09:20:09,900
What this is a real what are you talking about this is a game boy van

7543
09:20:10,460 --> 09:20:14,220
So this is the only what it's a real game boy van

7544
09:20:15,660 --> 09:20:17,660
This is my only thing

7545
09:20:18,220 --> 09:20:22,220
Wait, I have a triangle on my name. Why do I have triangle?

7546
09:20:24,220 --> 09:20:31,340
Yeah, this is the only thing if you complete the game but come back everything is still wrong

7547
09:20:31,980 --> 09:20:34,700
It's like it's as if you didn't do it

7548
09:20:35,420 --> 09:20:40,780
Which is such a shame. It means you won. Imagine the game Christianina. Yeah, like I

7549
09:20:42,140 --> 09:20:45,820
Now don't get me wrong for the explore. I don't I don't even know how I got there

7550
09:20:46,540 --> 09:20:51,740
For the exploring side of things I completely get leaving the monsters in the game

7551
09:20:52,540 --> 09:20:54,540
But I don't like it

7552
09:20:54,540 --> 09:20:56,460
The post game could have

7553
09:20:56,460 --> 09:21:01,580
Could have been much better in my opinion the post game should be the kingdom is restored

7554
09:21:01,980 --> 09:21:07,020
And you know make up some plot line where like oh linky need to you know get rid of the stragglers type thing

7555
09:21:07,100 --> 09:21:10,460
And maybe like kill all the monsters in the world and they perma stay away

7556
09:21:11,260 --> 09:21:12,780
um

7557
09:21:12,780 --> 09:21:15,740
It's too dangerous go home. Yeah, like everything's shut down

7558
09:21:16,460 --> 09:21:19,180
No, that's why we like did all that exploring

7559
09:21:19,980 --> 09:21:26,620
Um before because like everything gets all changed like the world is now permanently changed. We can't get to like pre

7560
09:21:27,740 --> 09:21:29,020
this

7561
09:21:29,020 --> 09:21:30,140
I think

7562
09:21:30,140 --> 09:21:33,580
Breath of the wind and thingy did that. I could be remembering what wrong

7563
09:21:35,580 --> 09:21:39,500
Yeah post games elder could be fun, but they've just never done it like don't get me wrong

7564
09:21:39,660 --> 09:21:43,580
If the development team like it a certain way they like it a certain way. That's fine

7565
09:21:44,620 --> 09:21:46,220
um

7566
09:21:46,220 --> 09:21:52,540
But I have to admit for a player that especially is enthralled with a zelda series like this could have been

7567
09:21:54,540 --> 09:21:56,540
This could have been a lot more fun

7568
09:21:58,700 --> 09:22:03,580
Um a legend of zelda god that postman did that leap even I can't leap hold on

7569
09:22:03,900 --> 09:22:05,900
How do you even I can?

7570
09:22:06,540 --> 09:22:08,540
um, but yeah, there's like

7571
09:22:08,620 --> 09:22:12,300
The only thing now really is we could just do code stone trading

7572
09:22:12,540 --> 09:22:13,740
and

7573
09:22:13,740 --> 09:22:15,580
Kinstone, but

7574
09:22:15,580 --> 09:22:17,580
You know is what it is

7575
09:22:17,900 --> 09:22:22,460
Closest you get is a password in the oracle game for the other game that implies you saved

7576
09:22:23,260 --> 09:22:25,260
the other land first

7577
09:22:28,140 --> 09:22:30,140
Um

7578
09:22:30,940 --> 09:22:35,660
But yeah, like it's just such a shame like how it all is as a mayor here

7579
09:22:36,620 --> 09:22:40,300
Monsters are coming everyone's standers. Oh that doesn't apply to you my boy link go get them

7580
09:22:40,700 --> 09:22:42,700
You're your sword and braver. You'll save the day

7581
09:22:45,100 --> 09:22:50,780
Um, yeah, it's such a shame because I think the post game could have been a lot more pretty like especially this in the situation

7582
09:22:51,180 --> 09:22:54,540
Being all alone is uh, well lonely. I'm going to find myself a nice home too

7583
09:22:57,100 --> 09:22:59,100
Um

7584
09:22:59,260 --> 09:23:01,260
There's extra dungeon bosses

7585
09:23:03,180 --> 09:23:09,580
Hey, wait, wait, wait for me. Um, but yeah, unfortunately, this is where it's like, uh, I really wish they didn't do that

7586
09:23:11,260 --> 09:23:16,700
And but it's the development team's choice, but for me as a player

7587
09:23:20,060 --> 09:23:23,100
Hi there, welcome. Sure. I'll take a rest. Um

7588
09:23:24,700 --> 09:23:31,340
Wait, I'll take the 200 room, please and three girls to come in that'd be great. Thanks. Enjoy your stay

7589
09:23:34,460 --> 09:23:37,180
Oh wait, we actually just straight up like stayed in a hotel

7590
09:23:37,580 --> 09:23:39,580
Oh

7591
09:23:39,980 --> 09:23:43,900
Well, yeah, I think we did it right. We should probably uh redirect into mercy. Hold on a minute

7592
09:23:44,460 --> 09:23:47,580
We should uh redirect into mercy because uh, there's nothing else I can do

7593
09:23:48,060 --> 09:23:53,980
Now I can get 100 but I honestly don't know what I'm missing and uh, we'd be at it for quite a while

7594
09:23:55,260 --> 09:23:58,620
And I'm not really fussed for it because I have kind of corrupted the fail

7595
09:23:59,420 --> 09:24:01,420
I've not corrupted it, but

7596
09:24:01,580 --> 09:24:06,860
The fail is now stuck in this like things are blocked off everyone go home dialogue

7597
09:24:06,860 --> 09:24:11,660
Which isn't that fun whereas like when you start the game everyone's like welcome to town

7598
09:24:12,220 --> 09:24:14,220
Town love all that jazz

7599
09:24:14,220 --> 09:24:16,220
But now it's like I'm messed up

7600
09:24:16,940 --> 09:24:19,260
You know what we'll go home and we'll see grandpa

7601
09:24:20,460 --> 09:24:26,620
Oh wait, he doesn't know that we've defeated fatty. Oh, no one knows we've defeated fatty. We can't even tell him

7602
09:24:26,860 --> 09:24:28,860
Oh

7603
09:24:28,940 --> 09:24:30,060
Oh, well

7604
09:24:30,060 --> 09:24:36,780
I'm so good. Yeah, it's just the same dialogue. Which is a shame that fail should have been us three girls come with a 400 room

7605
09:24:36,860 --> 09:24:38,860
I got 400

7606
09:24:38,860 --> 09:24:40,860
and but yeah

7607
09:24:41,500 --> 09:24:45,660
It's slow is on our head again type thing because we haven't done it

7608
09:24:46,380 --> 09:24:51,500
It's just a complete time loop. Which is such a shame. I I definitely think it could have been

7609
09:24:52,460 --> 09:24:57,260
A very adorable game if they did it right, I will make sure we're redirecting into mercy

7610
09:24:59,340 --> 09:25:01,820
Should I pick any kind of support?

7611
09:25:06,380 --> 09:25:08,380
Oh, she's playing death mark

7612
09:25:09,900 --> 09:25:14,140
What what's the what's the question she says the title of the stream is do you have the red stuff?

7613
09:25:15,100 --> 09:25:18,220
What's the red stuff the blue you got the blue?

7614
09:25:18,220 --> 09:25:20,220
I

7615
09:25:20,460 --> 09:25:24,940
Right, I'm gonna see if I can put me clapping a some more up

7616
09:25:25,500 --> 09:25:28,140
I'm probably not gonna do it right now because I think it's a bad time to do it

7617
09:25:29,420 --> 09:25:31,420
Where is my mercy?

7618
09:25:33,580 --> 09:25:34,860
See

7619
09:25:34,860 --> 09:25:36,860
redirecting to mercy

7620
09:25:37,180 --> 09:25:42,060
But we did it. Thank you so so much for letting me turn a four hour stream into

7621
09:25:42,940 --> 09:25:46,860
Nine and a half hours. Wow. Holy crap. It took me that long to piss off about

7622
09:25:48,300 --> 09:25:52,940
How did I do that? Honestly, I freaking I just I'll just stream for a wee bit

7623
09:25:53,580 --> 09:25:57,020
um tomorrow's streaming experience is

7624
09:25:57,580 --> 09:26:05,980
Only a few hours of old-school runescape. I'm gonna go hard on the wine because I have my first collab with none other

7625
09:26:07,020 --> 09:26:08,780
The mercy modis

7626
09:26:08,780 --> 09:26:10,780
We're gonna play hong kong gifts game

7627
09:26:11,420 --> 09:26:17,980
And we're gonna see what an earth goes on. Wow. We really endurance that I didn't even mean to like it was just like a little

7628
09:26:18,380 --> 09:26:20,380
Oopsie. Whoopsie

7629
09:26:20,860 --> 09:26:25,820
Thank you for showing us the minish cap. Oh, I'm so glad you could enjoy it for the first time if you've never seen it before

7630
09:26:25,900 --> 09:26:27,900

09:26:28,460 --> 09:26:32,940
I think it's a very sweet game. Definitely if they had post games, I feel more fun

7632
09:26:33,020 --> 09:26:36,700
But that's just me. Thank you so so much my little reeflings

7633
09:26:36,780 --> 09:26:41,580
Um, I'll go talk in mercy stream for a wee bit because I don't know what on earth what kind of game she's playing

7634
09:26:41,660 --> 09:26:44,620
But might as well watch it wee bit might as well watch it a wee bit

7635
09:26:45,260 --> 09:26:46,540
um

7636
09:26:46,540 --> 09:26:51,980
But thank you so so much billet reeflings. I'm so sorry to endurance you again and again night after night day after day

7637
09:26:52,140 --> 09:26:54,140
I just can't help it. Okay. I need a lot of you

7638
09:26:54,860 --> 09:26:57,900
And and I'll get a lot of you one way or another. Okay

7639
09:26:59,020 --> 09:27:01,900
Right. Thank you so so much. I love you

7640
09:27:02,140 --> 09:27:07,260
Please look after yourself and get a good stretch and a good water and a good sleeping because that was a

7641
09:27:08,460 --> 09:27:10,460
A longer stream yet. It was a long stream

7642
09:27:11,180 --> 09:27:15,740
Okay, we will redirect successfully into none other than mercy modis and we will be nice

7643
09:27:16,300 --> 09:27:22,860
And we will be respectful because remember I'm a fiend for the ink, but you know, you got everyone has their different licks

7644
09:27:22,940 --> 09:27:26,700
Okay, and mercy now might not be at the same lick as me. Okay

7645
09:27:27,660 --> 09:27:30,780
All right. Thank you so so much. I'll see you tomorrow on rinse cable cable
