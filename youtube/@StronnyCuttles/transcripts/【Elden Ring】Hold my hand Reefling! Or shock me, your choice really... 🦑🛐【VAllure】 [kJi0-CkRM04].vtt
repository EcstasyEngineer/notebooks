WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.880
I think I'll go in the corner today as if there's some sort of exiled beach over here.

00:19.880 --> 00:23.680
It doesn't really matter if I'm in the corner or not.

00:23.680 --> 00:29.200
I think I'll accidentally hide my runes in the bottom right widget if I go onto the

00:29.200 --> 00:34.200
that side so we're not going to go right in the corner for once.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.640
A Christmas mirror, honestly, I don't know.

00:37.640 --> 00:43.920
Right, I've just been prompted that I can put YouTube ads on, which I think means

00:43.920 --> 00:46.920
a stream's up, first of all.

00:46.920 --> 00:52.920
Hello, America, hiya, hello.

00:52.920 --> 00:57.520
You know the funniest thing about being a little bit late to streamers?

00:57.520 --> 01:03.200
Is that no one goes, oh no, she's cancelled because it's not even conceivable that I'm

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
not streaming.

01:04.200 --> 01:11.000
That's my favourite concept, instead of like, oh, she's late, she must be sick, she has

01:11.000 --> 01:12.560
to cancel type thing.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.720
It's like, nah, she gambled away the house.

01:16.720 --> 01:21.520
She hates us, she does, like, it's actually rather entertaining.

01:21.520 --> 01:30.480
Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon, do we have some good fucking use of yellow

01:30.480 --> 01:33.800
headquarters a day?

01:33.800 --> 01:39.120
If I'm not mistaken, and I don't want to spoil it, so I need to go look for it to make sure

01:39.120 --> 01:50.320
it's there, and T, yes, it's there, and T minus four hours.

01:50.320 --> 02:01.680
None other than Azura Dooley has been successfully monetised on YouTube, bips out in awe, round

02:01.680 --> 02:10.920
of applause for Azura's milky titties, she's been monetised, and now I'm allowed to talk

02:10.920 --> 02:17.520
about what the fuck happened with Azura's monetisation, she got denied monetisation,

02:17.520 --> 02:24.280
and I had to make poor Azura read a script, and she, in the script, she was like, hi YouTube,

02:24.280 --> 02:32.840
well, in her voice, hi YouTube, I am Azura Dooley, a creator from America, I am a YouTuber,

02:32.840 --> 02:39.880
so I did not show my body, I can't do her voice, but poor Azura had to like, do this

02:39.880 --> 02:49.440
super serious freaking video for me, and I had to like, screenshot her channel, and she

02:49.440 --> 02:56.640
had to be like, and I play video games, and it was so annoying, because obviously you

02:56.640 --> 03:05.520
had to use normie terms, so poor Azura had to be like, and my fans are so excited to

03:05.520 --> 03:10.920
enjoy my membership stream, and support me via super chat, because we were trying to go

03:10.920 --> 03:15.800
for like, if you monetise her, you'll be in the money, because you had money, money, money

03:15.800 --> 03:20.680
at the end of the day, so Azura did that, and we had to send in the appeal all behind

03:20.680 --> 03:24.760
the scenes, because obviously I didn't want to be like, one of the talents who'd been

03:24.760 --> 03:29.360
freaking denied monetisation, that's awful, an entire month for her to get monetised,

03:29.360 --> 03:36.240
no, bad, however, I do have a slight announcement about that Azura stream, you read it right,

03:36.240 --> 03:44.160
it is handcam, and she's also taking doodle requests, that money is gonna help her move

03:44.160 --> 03:52.880
out, don't I make myself clear, that money that she makes, yeah, is gonna help her move

03:52.880 --> 03:59.400
out, okay, so I don't want to see one fucking gritty day comment, I don't want to see it,

03:59.400 --> 04:05.320
it's gonna help her move out, and what happens if mummy Azura moves out, mummy Azura is free

04:05.320 --> 04:11.960
to make even more content, okay, so anyone that, oh Azura, you don't do ASMR, no plays

04:11.960 --> 04:19.720
on your channel, oh, so you don't, you don't, I'm doing enough ASMR, guess what, if she

04:19.800 --> 04:26.720
moves out, what do you think happens, hmm, hmm, right, put two and two together, what

04:26.720 --> 04:30.000
do you think happens when she moves out, she makes more content, put your money where your

04:30.000 --> 04:35.440
move is, hmm, hmm, that's what I thought, that's what I thought, that's terrible, my voice

04:35.440 --> 04:43.200
is broken beyond repair, unfortunately it is cracking, the original plan was none other

04:43.200 --> 04:49.560
than 12 hours of Elden Ring, I can't believe I'm so sorry to announce this refling, she

04:49.600 --> 04:55.960
moves out, my cock goes up, honestly all the bleeding hearts agree with that, is that a new

04:55.960 --> 05:02.320
mantra for the bleeding hearts, she moves out, my cock goes up, that's terrible, I'm

05:02.320 --> 05:09.640
hilarious, hmm, are you getting a roommate, funny you mentioned that, I actually said

05:09.640 --> 05:19.080
Azura, she can come with me if she wants, and, and she was like down for it and I'm

05:19.080 --> 05:25.560
like, well there is a problem of migration, you know that tiny little problem of like

05:25.560 --> 05:33.240
packing up your whole life and moving country, she can live with me, oh live with me if you

05:33.240 --> 05:39.080
want to come, Streamer House is real, we, I've not been funny, it was discussed at Vail or

05:39.080 --> 05:44.600
Headquarters, the possibility, however, the money you need and able to run a Streamer

05:44.600 --> 05:50.160
House, you basically have to accept there's a deficit debt already on top of how to run

05:50.160 --> 05:54.720
the company, now very thankfully the way that this company's structured, there's really

05:54.720 --> 06:01.320
not much overhead at all, again, it's free to produce thumbnails, the girls can stream

06:01.400 --> 06:06.280
what you want, it doesn't cost me $5 for Azura to put up an ASMR stream, you know what I

06:06.280 --> 06:11.200
mean, obviously the models cost a lot of money but that deficit gets paid over time,

06:11.200 --> 06:14.320
like I'm going to have ASMR role play come out and a lot of them are going to pay off

06:14.320 --> 06:19.320
some of the things, imagine all the months from now, literally could you imagine us banging

06:19.320 --> 06:24.160
on each other's door like, I'm trying to record ASMR, stop, well I was going to say something

06:24.160 --> 06:31.160
highly inappropriate there, stop banger-basting yourself for Twitter audio, I'm trying to

06:31.160 --> 06:40.680
record ASMR right now, yes, imagine if she moves it, well she actually did message me,

06:40.680 --> 06:44.280
but you didn't hear this from me okay but this is Inside Our Secrets, she messaged me

06:44.280 --> 06:47.520
and she said I'm really looking forward to doing YouTube role plays, which I'm really

06:47.520 --> 06:51.720
glad about because I'm worried about overworking them but she's on the same page, she's got

06:51.720 --> 06:57.840
her July audios to record first, which she should hopefully, well she's fucking getting

06:57.840 --> 07:02.720
steaming the night, I see steaming right now, she's getting steaming on box shot roulette,

07:02.720 --> 07:05.720
you guys are going to, I don't know if she's played it before but whoa that game's kind

07:05.720 --> 07:11.760
of hard to wrap your head around a little bit, but would I say that to them honestly,

07:11.760 --> 07:18.600
I don't think you understand that being under the umbrella of a slang makes you really comfortable

07:18.600 --> 07:25.040
with people, like it just does, like I feel really comfortable around the girls, I feel

07:25.040 --> 07:29.640
like I could show a picture of my floof and be like just something to look right here

07:29.640 --> 07:33.960
and the girls would be like mmm I ain't you need to get that checked out, like I think

07:33.960 --> 07:39.360
that's the degree of comfort, like if I had the wee hang on my wee bit and I'd be like

07:39.360 --> 07:47.120
ahhh, so yeah, for me anyway, yes I am not comfortable, how does it, how does it freaked

07:47.120 --> 07:58.840
out please with you, oh no, oh no, this can't be, oh no, we're at 8000.2 subscribers, oh

07:58.840 --> 08:18.400
no, this can't be, you can't do this to me, oh no, right, one pound free food, right,

08:18.400 --> 08:23.000
all looks good in the neighbourhood so I think we can get started, is there anything

08:23.000 --> 08:31.400
that I missed whilst I was passed out asleep, anything, oh I need to be able to see, now

08:31.400 --> 08:39.160
I know brightness 10 bad but so if it was barely visible, I can actually still see that

08:39.160 --> 08:45.840
at the one but I feel like the stream can't you see it so obviously for stream reasons,

08:45.840 --> 08:52.720
no don't discard that, I like it, I just say hi, I don't wanna spoil a good game here,

08:52.720 --> 09:02.840
so we have played the base game before and we've just never played the DLC, actually

09:02.840 --> 09:15.040
don't know how it gets activated, oh no, I think we did Samurai last time, why is Wretch

09:15.040 --> 09:23.240
need to, I confess there uses, see I need a two handed heavy hitter, a warrior is a two

09:23.240 --> 09:30.800
handed heavy hitter I think, you have to defeat this character to IS, I'm going to totally

09:30.800 --> 09:38.920
remember, I think warrior, I want to do two handed like wha bam, slow down, are you squidding

09:38.920 --> 09:45.760
me right now, no you're not, just tuning in, are we actually shocking strongy, I thank

09:45.760 --> 09:51.840
you for the five delay lover, I feel you'll be fucking ecstatic cos there was monetising

09:51.840 --> 09:59.920
during our celebration stream today, I bought this fricking shocker and in order to connect

09:59.920 --> 10:09.320
the bluetooth, it wants my phone number, not gonna be nasty but it's, I mean I know things

10:09.320 --> 10:12.720
already have my phone number, blah blah blah blah blah, I like tick tocks in a container

10:12.720 --> 10:16.800
on my phone, blah blah blah blah, but it's like no you're not allowed to progress without

10:16.800 --> 10:21.440
giving us your actual number cos we're gonna send you a verification code, I'm like a verification

10:21.440 --> 10:34.680
code to shock myself, I don't trust it, I don't, I don't think it's right, and it's

10:34.680 --> 10:42.360
actually really fucking weird cos that's not how technology should work, yeah I already

10:42.360 --> 10:48.960
bought the software, oh sorry I already bought the hardware, but the software is behind a

10:48.960 --> 10:56.920
verification code, why do I need to verify with my personal phone number in order to

10:56.920 --> 11:01.520
shock myself, so sitting on my desk fully charged to the left, literally shock caller

11:01.520 --> 11:05.800
wants to know your location, I'm like why the fuck do you need to know my location for

11:05.800 --> 11:14.000
me to go like, I'm sorry to anyone that's severely disappointed, I might buy a burner

11:14.000 --> 11:19.640
phone unironically just to fucking use it, right we're gonna go warrior, I like it a

11:19.640 --> 11:29.440
bit, what body type bravo is a waman, yeah I'm a waman, wait why is she two-handed, wait

11:29.440 --> 11:39.080
her dexterity, her intelligence is ten, wait I want like a warrior beast, do I want a warrior

11:39.080 --> 11:48.800
is a dual wheel dexterity built, didn't that samurai, wait so is that vagabond, strength

11:48.800 --> 11:57.840
fourteen, but dexterity's not really high, I just want a tank, vagabond is heavy armour,

11:57.840 --> 12:01.400
I came from that let me hold the ASMR, you're in for a rough ride mate but thank you for

12:01.400 --> 12:06.760
watching I do appreciate it, I do appreciate it, buying a cheap burner phone is it, yeah

12:06.760 --> 12:16.600
literally, hero, I want a hero, I can be a hero, oh there we go, I don't want a shield

12:16.600 --> 12:23.400
though, I want dual wheels, we'll change it later type, what is her name, oh is my controller

12:23.400 --> 12:32.720
dies already please don't do that, my name is, if I'm a two-handed warrior it sounds

12:32.720 --> 12:52.000
like I'm really good at giving, guys I'm a two-handed warrior, fondle abyssum, do you

12:52.000 --> 13:00.760
guys actually want fondle abyssum, fondle these two-handed, yeah we'll do fondle, we'll

13:01.760 --> 13:07.760
make sure you rip and piss, it was a good name, I don't care why I know it's fondle abyssum,

13:07.760 --> 13:18.000
right that was a good name, that's what I thought, I have terrible news, whoa, you close

13:18.000 --> 13:29.760
it, keeps it, oh that's correct you can get a wee extra cheeky thing, the golden seed

13:29.760 --> 13:39.000
enhance sacred flas, imps to do thy bidding, a cracked pot that somehow mends themselves

13:39.000 --> 13:47.440
a container for thrown items, wait you can have infinite items, what did he say, someone

13:47.440 --> 13:53.960
said get the seed, you would want me to get the seed wouldn't you, I see how you do, I

13:53.960 --> 14:00.400
am inclined to believe that gold seed is actually the best thing, five sacred branches charged

14:00.400 --> 14:10.880
with the euling power said to originate from the demigod maquela, that's right, not the

14:10.880 --> 14:17.160
seed you brought in girl, wait is it not, see, yeah the golden seed, no see, see, he said

14:17.160 --> 14:24.840
golden seed, right, base template and appearance, are we even bothered about this stuff, what's

14:24.840 --> 14:29.360
that, honestly that's like the color of me, just make the hair black, that's actually me

14:29.440 --> 14:39.400
like right now, cause I don't know, let me sip my tea to see if it's cold enough here, okay,

14:39.400 --> 14:48.520
oh actually me, a reef lander, a face from a far away isolated land of reefs, wink wink,

14:48.520 --> 14:54.480
I know it says reeds but I'm just gonna say reefs, where blood is a familiar say, reef

14:54.720 --> 15:00.640
flings, I think that's uh, check it out, whoa, we need to make it a bit bigger, we need to make

15:00.640 --> 15:06.040
sure it claps, it was destiny, pale women jump here, how dare you, right, we'll do it, we'll be a

15:06.040 --> 15:14.720
reef lander, it'll literally be for real girl, right, and then detail the appearance, what's my

15:14.720 --> 15:30.720
voice, are we really bothered about any of this, some folk are bothered, I'm not really that

15:30.720 --> 15:38.000
bothered, cause literally the first thing we do is slap some armor on us, so yeah, Fondula has

15:38.000 --> 15:44.480
been created even though she's in my image, but look, this goes out to Fondula, you were a fantastic

15:44.480 --> 15:49.520
name choice, I'm sorry I couldn't make it happen, okay, sorry Fondula, couldn't make it happen,

15:49.520 --> 15:56.320
no, before anyone else, yeah, anyone in Gen2 have a funny name like that, no, no, I didn't, oh can you

15:56.320 --> 16:03.280
hear, the fallen leaves tell a story, so crying

16:12.880 --> 16:16.880
the great Elden Ring was shattered

16:17.360 --> 16:27.840
in our home, across the fog, the lands between

16:31.040 --> 16:41.920
rise ye tarnished, I still remember that, rise ye tarnished, now queen marica the eternal

16:42.880 --> 16:45.120
is nowhere to be found

16:48.080 --> 16:58.720
and in the night of the black knife, god win the gold, who's first to perish, I just start swinging

16:58.720 --> 17:10.400
violently, run, soon marica's offspring, demigods all, Stacey Milken, I thought Stacey Milken was funnier

17:10.560 --> 17:18.400
than Fondula bosom to be honest, I mean, I guess it is Fondula bosom, I hardly even know her

17:18.400 --> 17:27.840
the mad taint of their newfound strength, sorry we're dropping the lore, triggered the shattering

17:27.840 --> 17:34.960
oh Keran beat is so good if I had a cs go player, all the names are reserved so, if I get a cs go player

17:35.200 --> 17:39.920
I'm calling her Keran beat, I already have all the assets

17:44.080 --> 17:50.320
oh maybe I should get a mercy to post a thing about that in the timeline, it's like time traveller

17:50.320 --> 17:56.080
goes back and kicks a rock and then like alternative universe and then I'll show you what Keran's assets

17:56.720 --> 17:58.080
uh mercy's assets

17:58.080 --> 18:04.160
rise now, you tarnished, rise now, you dead, who yet live

18:06.880 --> 18:11.920
the call of long lost rich speaks to us all

18:15.280 --> 18:19.440
oh why the games insist on white freaking screen

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
or a loom, chieftain of the badlands

18:26.400 --> 18:29.680
the ever brilliant gold mask

18:31.840 --> 18:34.880
fear the deathbed companion

18:37.680 --> 18:39.520
a lonesome dung eater

18:39.920 --> 18:41.520
boom we don't like it

18:49.600 --> 18:54.160
gold mask is literally me, we're autistic, oh this gold mask got the tism

18:55.120 --> 18:58.720
stroney are you peeling in reeflings, I can shake the dust off

18:59.760 --> 19:05.680
of, yes, yes this is a stream snipe game, yes sorry I'm sorry if I didn't explain

19:05.760 --> 19:07.440
follow the call would have been better

19:09.360 --> 19:11.920
if it doesn't present it, no there's no feeling, sorry

19:13.120 --> 19:15.040
if it goes on an attachment they can get it

19:24.400 --> 19:25.680
I have been breathed to lay

19:25.680 --> 19:29.840
cross the fog to the lands between

19:29.840 --> 19:37.840
to stand before the Elden Ring

19:42.640 --> 19:46.000
and become the Elden Lord

19:52.080 --> 19:55.280
right I'm slurped my tea but yes this is a stream

19:55.360 --> 19:58.640
sniping, how is someone dying right here, press E

20:01.040 --> 20:02.480
how is someone dying here

20:04.400 --> 20:08.960
bro what did you take poison damage and just perish, right can I even remember how to play

20:08.960 --> 20:15.520

20:15.600 --> 20:17.440
only give me controller input

20:21.680 --> 20:24.240
stop giving me keyboard input right now

20:26.960 --> 20:30.240

20:33.600 --> 20:42.320

21:22.880 --> 21:27.440
rusty, see, oh why is it a stream sniping game, it is a stream sniping game

21:27.840 --> 21:29.440
oh

21:32.720 --> 21:38.320
you can change to show only control, yes I did, I'm a smart B

21:39.360 --> 21:45.440
but oh don't you dare, you jump off ahead, oh he's, he's, he's, oh it's Ranny

21:47.440 --> 21:50.000
all right hold on let me finish my tier else this isn't happening

21:53.120 --> 21:55.120
yeah game sound is very loud

21:57.600 --> 22:02.640
even the ambience, right we're just getting selfs, don't worry, don't worry, we're just getting

22:05.920 --> 22:12.800
master volume but it's too loud so shove it down to a sub, is there anything in particular

22:12.800 --> 22:18.560
that would be good, music is good but S effect's way too high, right put that down by five

22:18.800 --> 22:22.720
I don't know, this is a whack

22:26.000 --> 22:28.960
this is my voice whilst I'm whacking and doing combat

22:33.040 --> 22:37.680
wow much better, we want to hear more of your voice, okay there we go, we tested it,

22:37.680 --> 22:44.000
everyone happy, nice, nice a lot better, okay let me finish this tier else it's gonna go cold

22:44.320 --> 22:52.160
did I miss anything, well there is no voice, oh well from the

22:54.000 --> 23:00.080
the people, listen it's just X swing, exactly that's the S effect you're getting, nothing else

23:00.080 --> 23:06.000
because I'm not out to start there, you need to get a multiplayer password as well, yes I cannot

23:06.000 --> 23:16.160
call you in yet until I unlock a site of grace, would anyone like to site of grace, wow look at that

23:16.160 --> 23:25.120
the pretty firefly, I know it's not fireflies and it's from that but you will not believe your eyes

23:25.120 --> 23:33.520
lit up like a firefly, bit up the world as I fell asleep, what will the password be, probably

23:33.520 --> 23:41.920
Reef, R-E-E-F, if you hold Y and press right bumper you can two hand the axe, why right bumper,

23:43.600 --> 23:51.440
actually get your factually right, wait you can beat people up with this, take this and this

23:52.160 --> 24:05.840
wow, yo, okay let's see, hold on let's unequipped, no sorry wrong thing, let's unequipped my shield

24:05.840 --> 24:14.560
for the purpose that I wanted just two hand with the axe, how does one take off a shield, unequipped

24:15.520 --> 24:23.200
well, oh I forgot how this shape works, equipment, equipment, obviously there's equipment and not

24:23.200 --> 24:29.920
anything works, why would you, right I'm un-equipped it and then take the axe, what was it, you can throw

24:29.920 --> 24:39.600
punches in this game, oh my god imagine him waltz by a punch, um zero death shield bash run, I think

24:39.680 --> 24:44.800
I bet you there's, I used to watch Elden Ring content and it used to be like one,

24:46.160 --> 24:52.320
one mage versus like three Rannas, like that kind of thing, it was like three Rannas versus like

24:52.320 --> 24:57.120
18 Elden thingies and like you know like I don't know if you've seen those videos, I just used to

24:57.120 --> 25:02.720
watch them and be like huh I'm so entertained right now, it was complete brain rot, Elden Ring brain rot

25:03.600 --> 25:09.360
what was your cheat code, hold y and then press the right bumper

25:12.560 --> 25:21.600
oh there we go, I was holding the left bumper, wow, oh my god I'm actually a one-handed, well

25:21.600 --> 25:25.840
two-handed warrior, oh my god right I've almost finished my tea

25:26.320 --> 25:33.120
and then the weathlands, oh I need to get a piece of paper to make sure I make it as fair as possible

25:33.120 --> 25:40.000
now before I'm going to start fighting with the accusations in my head, before someone goes

25:40.880 --> 25:48.080
favoritism would you rather a streamer that doesn't interact with you,

25:49.120 --> 25:55.440
does they play video games with you and does they make an effort to have you on stream,

25:55.440 --> 26:02.800
yes or no, no you don't want that, so if I accidentally let someone in when that someone

26:02.800 --> 26:09.760
else hasn't even been in, has anyone any fucking accusations, right and I even got a piece of paper

26:09.760 --> 26:14.400
I'm actually gonna have to go get a piece of paper, do excuse me for a moment little

26:14.400 --> 26:16.400
everything, I don't have the paper

26:16.400 --> 26:18.400
well I don't even know

26:44.400 --> 26:54.400
so

26:59.040 --> 27:06.480
and actually the piece of paper has uh it's actually an old piece of paper that I used to use to track

27:06.480 --> 27:10.400
the girl's scripts, do you want me to leak some content because I'll do it right now

27:10.400 --> 27:12.400
I'll do it right now

27:15.600 --> 27:20.400
oh there's like I could only leak Azur's apparently I only wrote Azur's on this for some reason

27:22.400 --> 27:26.400
uh oh hell oh I don't need to

27:26.400 --> 27:31.360
okay I gotta live strong anyway she yells please stop shouting I'm getting all hot and bothered

27:32.240 --> 27:37.040
yeah it depends on the leakage I've got a plot theme when

27:37.920 --> 27:43.600
in August Azur has a giant test audio apparently I don't know if I wrote it or not yet

27:45.200 --> 27:49.280
um September she has a reach around for

27:53.120 --> 28:02.480
she has bulk worship as well in September hopefully that was well well this little piece of paper says

28:03.440 --> 28:09.440
this is a big uh leg bump bumping leg bumping

28:16.880 --> 28:21.920
holy shit I have the what this has notes from the interviews that I gave the girls

oh my god yes someone from Japan almost got in someone from England almost got in holy

28:51.280 --> 28:59.200
wow this is an old archivable piece of paper that I picked up just to write everyone's name in it

28:59.920 --> 29:05.920
don't throw that away keep it no it's got information of people that weren't even talents this is old

29:09.440 --> 29:17.360
is your uh hyper fixation is cooking do you get favorism that's so specific no no one gets

29:17.360 --> 29:23.680

I'm all clean and I smell like lemon now at least and my hair isn't greasy

30:58.880 --> 31:00.240
um

31:03.040 --> 31:07.360
torrent torrent hello America hi

31:11.680 --> 31:15.920
don't worry torrent fortune is on her side

31:18.560 --> 31:20.400

31:31.680 --> 31:36.640
that's my one of her kind is sure to seek the elden ring

31:39.760 --> 31:44.800
wow even if it does violate the golden order

31:48.400 --> 31:48.800
um

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
my personal conspiracy the horses named torrent to make it harder no I'm pretty sure that

31:56.800 --> 31:58.160
I'm pretty sure they got proven

32:01.920 --> 32:07.920
dev team was like yeah nah cuz we spent too much time on this and love and effort and I mean

32:07.920 --> 32:15.360
sorry this game quality well then again Japanese work history everyone works overtime for free so

32:15.360 --> 32:23.520
that kind of but hopefully maybe the soft form uh soft form soft wear wear form soft form wear

32:24.240 --> 32:30.160
something something like that um okay down on the d-pad to heal

32:32.000 --> 32:39.040

32:45.600 --> 32:50.080

33:53.920 --> 34:03.200
honestly Azura kind of already covers that I got a third concept back um which I'm quite pleased

34:03.200 --> 34:08.080
with materials and every corner one you'll find fruit and flowers mushrooms and butterflies and

34:08.080 --> 34:12.320
various other materials these materials can use for crafting I cannot for the life me remember

34:12.320 --> 34:18.160

enemy is at this enemy please do not think that me uh success success but doing the tutorial

35:35.920 --> 35:41.040
is actually an indication that things are going well for me and I'll be all right it is not

35:41.600 --> 35:47.440
stance breaking charge right trigger uh and right trigger while jumping that's my favorite

35:47.840 --> 36:02.240
oh my god oh my god I love it here oh my god oh my god the stake of marica upon dying

me first time okay maybe two-handed warriors literally always for me because why was that so easy

36:45.920 --> 36:49.760
okay I should have been two-handed from the start is the game a bit loud

36:50.800 --> 36:57.280
sorry maybe in the fights it gets loud let's let's have a little invest immigration of the

36:57.280 --> 37:03.440
audio said that put it is quite loud okay it's now five

37:05.840 --> 37:09.920
this is the talking whilst combat and things are being enabled

37:12.080 --> 37:17.520
strutting wants to hold it two-handed can I I mean I already shrug it my hands and you know

37:17.520 --> 37:24.480
generic length strength oh how do I do gestures again I can't remember is it off on the d-pack no

37:24.480 --> 37:27.440
it can't be the d-pack that has to be something else

37:31.520 --> 37:38.800
wait I can hold that oh that's how I look I don't have enough for two-handed no refling are you sure

37:38.800 --> 37:44.560
my hands are actually pretty small I'm not gonna win in start menu on the right

37:45.120 --> 38:02.400
oh is this just oh my god oh my god our journey begins all over again it's amazing isn't it

38:06.640 --> 38:11.280
unfortunately we don't have a key to explore this yet but don't think we won't

38:12.000 --> 38:15.280
let me put my headset off of it because I think my headset's quite low actually

38:16.880 --> 38:18.160
I've got a clip to gesture

38:30.560 --> 38:37.840

right uh uh right okay hold on hold on right multi-player yep that's good

38:59.600 --> 39:06.720
uh set a password and it's gonna be capital it's gonna be reef in capital letters okay

39:08.640 --> 39:17.920
reef reef you're not trying to solo the bosses no see this is the best part about my stream okay

39:19.120 --> 39:25.440
you you get to carry me through the entire game you can leave a gold summon sign to play

39:25.760 --> 39:27.040
oh no wait

39:32.640 --> 39:40.080
does that not have it yet is anyone here I'm looking for a gold but you I might not have

39:40.080 --> 39:46.160
unlocked it because I don't have you have to summon us from the signs you need another I am

39:46.160 --> 39:51.760
man man I hate it here what do you mean I can't have my reef

39:56.000 --> 40:00.800

40:02.240 --> 40:08.560
oh yes tarnished are we come to the lands between for the Elden Ring

40:08.800 --> 40:17.680
hmm of course you have no shame in it unfortunately for you however you are made of

40:17.680 --> 40:20.880
um no I got my reef lens and I'm gonna run a train on them

40:22.880 --> 40:30.960
your words funny man mean nothing to me to the round table hold you are fated it seems

40:31.840 --> 40:38.320

40:39.280 --> 40:41.520
can I right we're going to go to the church

40:43.680 --> 40:46.080
uh but we need to avoid the horse guy

40:48.080 --> 40:55.920
because I look all the dead blood as opposed to live blood but I guess blood's only live if it's

40:56.000 --> 41:00.720
inside the user that created the blood no actually that's a lie because you can

41:01.600 --> 41:05.600
you can put blood in other people that's your blood as long as you're all negative or you're

41:05.600 --> 41:10.240
sure the same blood type do you know if you're all negative yeah you have the most valuable

41:10.240 --> 41:19.440
blood type and oh wait I forgot wait hold on hold B to run yeah hold B to run yes yes

41:20.400 --> 41:28.000

41:39.280 --> 41:45.440

41:46.160 --> 41:50.400

41:52.400 --> 41:56.880

54:19.520 --> 54:28.720
problem with the tarnish like shot color there's no shock color because um for some reason I need

54:28.720 --> 54:36.160

torrent has chosen you

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:16.240
treat him with respect yeah I see as I accidentally fall off glass all the time so now I turn my

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.720
rooms to strength oh my god we're gonna touch

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:24.960
my hand rest upon I got my feet and everything for this for a better moment share them with me

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.400
okay your thoughts your ambitions so what happens if I do strength the principles you would follow

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.160
strength is just straight up attack and that

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.040
so what I want to put it in strength we bit of vinegar

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.400
and a wee bit of day that's pretty little with arcane that's magic

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:58.800
faith is low endurance and I need 10 dexterity if I want to upgrade the weapon okay I can do that

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.640
I mean I can do quite a lot considering how much runes the refunds gave me you need 10

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:05.860
and

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.720
fit it all into strength I don't mind getting my xp bar a bit bigger the reason for higher xp

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:21.040
so I don't fuck it up and then keep de-sinking and then we have to keep calling in more refunds for

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:30.080
more reinforcement and bigger bigger yeah strength and dexterity are both attacked just on different

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.680
weapons okay so I'm strength because of the way I'm handling that yeah okay yes please

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:44.720

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:29.120
it is a secret you can have friends like this in Elden Ring where you guys carry me through the game

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.880
that'll let her hold me that I get much of a debuff if she hugs me

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.120

bifling's gonna tell you something embarrassing because you're watching the stream right now I

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:48.880
don't mind exchanging this knowledge and I audibly farted in one of my recent streams and no one

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.920
caught it and I don't know how no one heard it because it was so loud because my little booty

01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:05.200
cheeks clapped so I was a bit surprised I know I I feel so bad because I was like wait how did

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:11.760
no one notice the braptubers were supposed to be rejoiced skimming through the balls this instant

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:20.800
no no no no no I don't what um I don't know how you guys didn't hear it I honestly don't know there's

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.400
accident and I almost got pushed off the map oh where are you you're a brick hammer a hammer made

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:08.640
of brick and mortar that's what I like to see right

01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:17.280
playing the game for the first time right now it is kicking my ass any reef leaves to carry me to

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:23.520
sad face oh thank you for the tip boy um I'm actually sure there'll probably be reeflings that

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:29.920
are willing to help you out I think wait no I've already been here no I need to climb up the ladder

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:34.560
again oops I was supposed to go left not right I'm sure reeflings will help you

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.160
just make sure you make sure your coat is reefed

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:49.520
quite possible sun suppression did it stop I'll check again where I did it but you that was

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:58.560
scary don't do that again you might myself clear that was scary and I like 100% sure it was audible

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:04.720
but we maybe because like my room creeps all this oh that's an enemy that no one heard it or just tell

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.680
he's always make a reefling multiplayer quick yeah yeah yeah we have reef reef is it r e e f reef

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:21.360
like me uh no there's nothing on the edge because I've explored the edge before I think there's a

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:32.000
knight in arm my thought you were an enemy reefling you have to be careful I knew there was this bad

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.880
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa ouch he's beating my ass I need to hit him there we go get

01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:48.640
staggered uh is there anything down here nope just imminent death let's not uh fight gravity today

01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:54.480
multiplayer passcode is weak yes that is the pinned message for anyone who is lurking and you're

01:43:54.480 --> 01:44:02.640
like huh whatever however we stream sniping this game um the password is reef and in multiplayer

01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:08.720
um and oh there's a bow and arrow man how'd I get across

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:11.360
this

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.440
I don't know I actually don't trust that how'd I get close

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.960
this I mean if someone put down a marker there

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:29.200
one more ow kick me

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:36.640
and there's your chance of your big show yes if you're lurking and you don't understand how Elden

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:44.880
Ring is technically a stream sniping game we have a multiplayer passcode here um that's not at all

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:52.400
yeah it is top right the it's reef and fill capital letters and every sign or mark of grace

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:58.240
you're pointing go down you want me to go down oh reefling's showing you something

01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:02.240
what is you what are you showing me reefling show me show me show me show me

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:09.920
what are you showing me oh mark of grace yes this is how uh you can stream snake mean by

01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:15.600
mark of grace but the problem is oh you give me tons of flowers so I can make more the only

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:20.880
problem is I can only have two good reeflings at a time and then one naughty reefling at a time

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:26.560
but that naughty reefling means that we don't ever get in trouble wait that I despawn

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:33.440
hey how can I get uh did other reefling perish

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:40.320
uh other reefling oh where did you go oh no you were right there uh

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:51.200
set up a group password please sorry that's a group password

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:58.080

Oh, sorry. I need to activate it. Sorry. Sorry. I didn't realize you couldn't

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.360
That's not nice

01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:19.360
Oh, I see in school berries. How was your rave session?

01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.040
You guys have a little rave together wait

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:27.920
I know this place. We've been here before do we go up the stairs now?

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:35.680
Where's purple refling? He's already going high snow berries. Did you enjoy getting steam in what I see?

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:41.840
I see nobody read. Hopefully I see gets enough hydration. I don't know. I guess like we go up here

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.280
Hello

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:52.080
Welcome on and I'm currently doing a stream sniping game which is elden ring. Oh surprise surprise

01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:53.760
um

01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:59.920
The reflings have already overpowered me an astronomical amount. We're just exploring the first castle

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.720
Unfortunately, I'm a bit all turned around and not sure where to go. But you know what?

01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:08.640
It's about the exploring we made along the way. Wait, is this a dead end?

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:14.880
Have I just taken us to a dead end? That would be very thin, but I'm glad the snowberries enjoyed your rave. Oh, yeah

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.080
Steaman is one way to put it. Is she blackout?

01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:20.640
Does that need a message her?

01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.040
Does that need a message her?

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:27.680
Hmm, you're making me nervous. Does that need a message?

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:35.680
Yes or no? Hi radius welcome. We're running a train on this castle. I'm to jump, but this is so dangerous

01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:43.280
Oh, no, I'm not a fan of heights, but I'll do it for you refling. Oh, no, she is okay. No, she's fine. Okay. Okay. I won't message her

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:55.200
Okay. Okay. Follow the purple. Follow the purple. Easy. Easy. Follow the purple. Gentle. Gentle. Gently. Gently. Follow the purple

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:03.440
Refling, no

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.320
Refling, no

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:11.520
We've lost our first refling. This cannot be. Wait, do I have an emotional gesture?

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.480
To say goodbye to

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:17.600
I'm so sorry. No, no, not like that

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:25.920
We lost our first refling to gravity rip rip refling. Okay. We'll we'll we'll keep going. We'll push onwards

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.800
I don't clap at him. That's not nice

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:36.720
Fill the dexterity check. Oh, right. We'll follow and we'll get to the next location

01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:41.680
What? What? I'll I'll be in the corner so you can go ahead purple refling

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.720
What?

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:45.840
A

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.840
What we're currently

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.560
Are you squinting me right now? No, there's no shock. How's the shock collar being used?

01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.800
So we flying

01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:57.280
No shock collar

01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:58.880
because

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:01.840
Something very strange. What? How did you do that?

01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:04.800
I need to get good at the game with you guys, honestly

01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:11.760
The shock collar is requiring me to give me its phone number to use the software and

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.920
I'm going to have to buy a burner phone to get it operational

01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:22.240
Um, or I'm actually probably just going to buy a new brand of shock collar because there is actually no reason why

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:29.760
I should have to give personal information to click that on a freaking button of our shock collar

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:32.240
Um, are these birds aggressive?

01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:34.960
No

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.560
Uh

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.560
Are we going the wrong way?

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:43.040
Honestly. Oh wait. Oh wait. Pick up the thing. Pick up the thing. Sorry. There's a thing there that you pick up

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:48.080
That's like, but thank you bro. The legend a claw talisman

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:51.200
How do I click talisman?

01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:53.920
Oh

01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:57.520
Wait, no, it's an equipment

01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.040
Uh

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:06.160
Enhances jump attacks. Okay. That's pretty perfect considering all I do is go. Oh, yeah every time I get an enemy. I mean

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:09.200
Give it all her info

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:11.520
Yeah

01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:16.080
What is the password for it's how you stream snipe me and elden ring

01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:19.920
So I can have two good reeflings and one bad reefling at a time

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.200
Okay

01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:24.880
But you need to put down your mark at a certain location

01:59:25.280 --> 01:59:30.960
So unfortunately, you do have to have already played the game. That is a big jump big jump

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:34.560
Uh, thankfully it goes to stamina damage. Um

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:38.160
I

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:40.160
Top down here. Okay

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:43.920
Uh

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.320
Oh wow

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:50.080
Wow, we are getting deep in these catacombs

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:59.360
Oh, we need to do this one. Okay. Well, I did buy uh like four stone dying level 75 already

01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:06.560
I may or may not have been gifted just a little tiny just a wee amount of runes just to get started. Okay

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.560
Like it's um

02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:09.840
What?

02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:13.280
It was just to get me started, you know, like I didn't really oh

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.720
I actually dodged that. Okay, but I didn't well

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:24.160
I mean that worked out fantastically all things considered and it was I just needed a wee bit, you know

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:28.720
And the refunds were very kind and gave me some some very happy to see

02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:33.600
Whoa, is the enemy right right there? I don't want to get pushed off the map

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.200
Okay, follow purple reefling

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:41.040
Are we is there something out there or is it just that guy that stands on the shelf?

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.760
I'm looking nothing. Okay. Just checking just checking

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:53.200

02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:58.080
Small runes. Oh, we did like a big basic get back to the bus. Okay

02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:01.120

02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.600
And maybe we can get a new wishlist

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:09.440
Something's going on back there. I don't know what

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.800
Uh, this is like an entire battlefield

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.920
Oh, no, I ain't good like that. Oh, I'm not good at this game like that

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.200
I'm not good at this game like that. Okay. Okay. Hold on. I actually gonna have to use my brain

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:27.600
We're gonna keep doing jump attacks. Okay

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:32.400
I need to restore my stamina bar. That's fine

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:35.360
You're next. Goodbye

02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:38.080

I was healing stop it. I was healing. Wait. I just whacked that freaking pillar. Stop it. I'm healing

02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:53.600

02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:57.920
I don't know. I need I can't tell yet. Whoa. That's the baddie

02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:01.200
Oh my god

The game I would not have gotten very far with that. I have one more class

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:14.000
Be careful about a cheeky HP, but it's okay. It's okay

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:19.920
Protect refill and mummy. Oh, there's a portrait. Hello

Don't care. I love it. It's good. I love prophecies. I find them absolutely fascinating when did you guys see June?

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:43.680
Wait, is there gonna be a reference here if I touch this?

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:47.280

Are you spewing on me? What is why does it not hurt me?

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.080
It puts me asleep

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:16.960
Sleep wait, but sleep didn't even put me asleep. It just like did explain

02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:23.440

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:48.240
I uh, I did not crack all those rooms. This is gonna be ridiculous. I did not crack

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.360
Are we ready?

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:58.160
You can't get banned for this stuff. It's not that kind of game where they're like, we're gonna ban you, right? Surely not

02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:10.640
Surely it's not that kind of game that gets you banned for this silly stuff. Yeah, I didn't think so. Oh, no

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.280
A million a million of pop

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.880
No, we're gonna be so

02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:26.240
But it's perfect because that's exactly what I want

02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:32.640
Oh, this is fantastic. Oh, no, sorry. I didn't mean to use a singular one

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:36.320
I don't think it's gonna make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things. All right, let's try that again

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:39.040
Use an event

02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:43.840
Forms so severely deals with hackers in their full game

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:45.920
Hmm

02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:53.200
I guess if you're really into like the multiplayer aspect of like, uh, 1v1 in someone I can see how it might be annoying

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.920
Are we about to hit 10 million?

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:01.280
I think we are

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.680
Wait, is that 11 million? Hold on, let me do the

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:11.280
Wait, am I being Papaga?

02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:17.440
Uh 11? Oh my god, 11 million runs on our person

02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:21.040
Bruh

02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:23.680
Bruh

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:27.760
Oh my god, that's like that's insane

02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:31.680
That is insane. Thank you so much

02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:38.720
Um, yeah, I think we can go up a few more levels

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:47.520
Right, so what did someone say 60 vigor and then strength and then what a few in dexterity, maybe

02:05:49.200 --> 02:05:56.240
Endurance, I wouldn't mind because I like swinging my sword. This is fucking ridiculous. We're still going

02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:58.960
80 strength

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:04.880
Oh, we can get 82 strength 40 endurance get that 60

02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:09.040
Endurance faith and mind

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:13.760
Faith isn't too handed. Am I mistaken?

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.200
Are you trolling did I read it trolling?

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.160
And the rest on whatever you plan on the put all the points into faith. I'm lying. Please don't do this

02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:27.360
Okay, one hit Malena. Hopefully I I think we're gonna one hit her but if strength is

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:33.120
Right stamina is gonna go up quite a bit, which is good because I'm kind of like oh my god. Wait

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:37.840
I

02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:42.640
How much can I it keeps going?

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:50.320
It keeps going we can max out

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:59.600
40 endurance is a soft cat, okay, so just do that

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:02.160
A

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:04.480
More endurance

02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:06.720
Don't get 40 on that

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:12.080
Vigor soft calf is 60. Is it?

02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:20.080
80 is a hard cut for things. This is the highest level. I've seen someone have

02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:23.200
Brov literally now didn't even earn any of it

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:31.360
You have 15 million you can max out everything. Okay, I giggled it. Yeah soft cat on 60

02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:33.440
Okay

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:38.480
So we'll do that and then what put in endurance. Oh, no, you said endurance is also got soft cat when I'm like, sorry

02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:41.520
someone said um

02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:44.640
60 and 80 strength

02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:50.880
So there's not really I have 106 hours on my character in your higher level than it already

02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:53.920
What can I say the reeflings love support in me?

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.960
Ryan

02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:01.600
You are now a higher level than I am. I've been playing for 130 hours

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:05.920
Get rekt origan. Thank you for the five get rekt

02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:11.360
So when you say soft cap, do you just mean like it hardly improves anything?

02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:14.800
basically

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.640
I seen that's what you mean. She already beat the game

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.680
Okay, so it hardly improves it

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:28.640
They didn't change anything. Oh, this changes my max equipment load though. I kind of want that because I'm doing heavy rule

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:31.360
Okay

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:34.720
Well, why do you have a thing on it? Why does it have a ring around it?

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:38.480
What

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:42.560
Is that a president of the united states in my video game right now?

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:46.640
And you come mr. Richard

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:50.160
Nixon the president of the united states

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:52.560
um

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:54.560
I do

02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:01.120
I was absolutely mortified. I thought that said something else there. Oh my god. I need my glasses on now

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:05.200
Let's not do that. Oh have a red. I need a red

02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:08.080
just a fella and

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.520
And

02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:12.560
Who came in first? Oh shit everything's out of order

02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:17.600
Right you came you came

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:21.440
Why are you naked mr. President?

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.360
Oh my god, can you actually fight

02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:30.240
Are you doing is it don't dog Zori or something? I can't remember the name

02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:35.120
My beloved all we need to get the coconuts so we can talk to each other

02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:40.320
That's basically have diminishing returns to hire the stat the fewer benefits for more of the stats

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.440
Get them into rent to six there 80

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:51.040
Dogeza, dogeza, dogeza. I'm trying to imagine how you say it dogeza

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:57.840
Oh

02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:35.040
We still here and see you girl you just got banned stop imagine if I was the first freaking runescape player to get banned

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:39.440
For like mass levelling up and form soft is like you're not allowed on our game anymore

02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:42.480
Could you imagine?

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.120
Could you imagine?

02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:51.600
That would be ridiculous runescape player

02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:56.240
You're still streaming wait runescape

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.840
Wait, what did I say? Wait, what did I say? Did I say jagged?

02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:09.600
Yeah, I hope I didn't ruin that wrong game you said runescape. Oh, sorry

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.880

Maybe I need to get a cup of tea what how long it's already been two hours. It feels like an hour

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.880
Okay, wait, sorry

02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:27.600
I need to scrub out everyone's name that I just wrote down there because you didn't actually get a chance to play

02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:31.200
So I'm taking your names out of the paper. Okay

02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:35.360
And then I'm starting a new list at the side, but because

02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:40.480

Funny and long name, right? I'm gonna very quickly make a copy see I will literally be like four minutes

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:32.960
The reason I always say four minutes four minutes one

02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:36.640
The kettle takes forever to boil

02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:42.800
It takes forever. Okay, please everyone. I highly recommend get up. Have a little stretch

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:48.080

Please don't worry. I will be here when you wake up unironically. This is an endurance stream

02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:57.120
You know damn it's not connecting. Oh no

02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:00.880

I am like 99% sure I've had issues with this summoning area before in another life

I'm going to very quickly make a cup of tea. Please do get up. Get a wee thingy. Um, is this an endurance stream? No, it's just eight hours

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.280
Let's be honest here. We already know it's not gonna be eight hours

02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.720
Right, I'm gonna very quickly make a cup of tea. I'll be right back. Okay. Please get a snack

I

02:19:57.040 --> 02:19:59.040
I

02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.040
I

02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:31.040
I

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.040
I

20 20

02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:20.400
Two zeros in a row. Why would that be?

02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:26.160
Why would that be blanked out? That's so confusing

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Sometimes

02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:35.600
I've got a little blueberry muffin to keep me going until I get some food

02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:40.560

Uh, right ubi soft hate absolutely absolutely decimated so they've tried it for some reason they can't connect to one another

02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:56.560
Yeah, the server's got all of them. I think yeah, even though they're all in the same region

02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:05.040
Ubi hate, yeah, okay. Sorry. Let me finish my muffin really quickly

02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:12.320
Oh, I never put my light on

We don't want to be in the future but don't acknowledge her in America also me on day one you guys want to see my toggles

02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:34.880
Actually, I paid how much for these toggles never use the bloody things

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.360
Eh, none of this guy replays. What are you doing?

02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:45.280
I just get so into it though. I'm sorry. I'm like so into it

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:50.000
I'm like I can't if my hat goes off to vtuber's that are like

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:59.200
And like change their toggle without even having to think like I don't even know how you do it

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:03.440
Like what the fuck is going on out there?

02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:08.160
Like genuinely don't know how you do it like

02:25:11.680 --> 02:25:15.760
Like how the fuck do you do that? I am in the moment. I do not have time to be like

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:21.680
Oh, right. This button is how I activate the the question mark thingy. Like I don't know how to do it

02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:27.200
Pain a smiley on the hotkeys for the toggle

02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:32.720
No, I have oh, I don't have to smell it have the names like this is called love because it makes my heart's love heart

02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:35.040
Makes my heart's makes me

02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:37.200
Unlike I've got

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:40.720
You said what

02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:43.680
Someone say anal

02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:47.280
Anal

02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:53.600
Um

02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:55.920
Yeah

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
I'm such a fake

02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:02.400
Actually, you can't call me a fake vtuber. How much have you fucking spent on the vtuber community?

02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:04.400
I will not tolerate any slander such as this

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:08.000
Actually, that's where I draw the line at the slander. You can call me a bad vtuber

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.520
But you can't call me a fake one uh with the amount of money I'm fucking putting to the

02:26:14.880 --> 02:26:16.880
I'm down for it

02:26:18.080 --> 02:26:23.120
Toggles are useless because uh, we know what face mummy is making already. Well, just teasing

02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:26.240
I'm just teasing through this entire stream

02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:33.120
But yes, uh, my daughter should be going live soon tm question mark. I don't know what's happening, but

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:40.400
I can't even figure it out, but please do watch them. I'm doing endurance. I'm going to be here all week

02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:44.480
Okay, we are stuck on this game for the next few days and when I say stuck

02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:47.680
I mean you're stuck in the wall and I've just come across your stuff

02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:50.800
Yeah, I'll make myself clear

02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:58.160
You thought some people do have like so I can like

02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.720
Puff my cheeks automatically like I'm puffing my cheek. I'm sick of my tongue. That's automatic

02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:08.640
I can also go angry. That's automatic. I can also go sad

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:11.920
All right, open my like this is all automatic

02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:17.840
Anything beyond that is what is called a face toggle. This is a toggle

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:21.280
This isn't going to come on if I like look a certain way in the tracker, you know

02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:23.520
um

02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:26.080
Like again with a blush. This isn't going to come on so

02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:33.040
That would you be playing shadow of urchie? Is that the name of the dlc? Because if so, yes, we are playing the game

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:36.560
The base game

02:27:37.840 --> 02:27:43.920
But well, I say we play and you guys are carrying me through the base game so we can do the dlc part

02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:48.480
But yes, okay, we're playing switch ways at that door

02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:51.440
It may be this door

02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:54.160
Oh, look it isn't this door

02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.880
Don't be filled with flings

02:27:57.440 --> 02:27:59.760
Oh, we got sonic the hedgehog up in here

02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:04.320
Do you guys actually see the sonic the hedgehog movie? I didn't

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:10.320
Don't tell it. Don't tell Amy from my yumi plus that I didn't see the sonic

02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:11.920
Uh

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:16.240
Movies she's like obsessed with shadow everything they're sonic and I'm like thing

02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:22.000
I thought you know, I thought I was like pretty deep in it doing the like sonic heroes

02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:28.000
I don't know what we're doing. I'm just following you guys. Sorry. I'm going on a ramble. You guys are gonna have to actually

02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:36.800
I'm getting distracted like oh, that's an enemy. I thought that was the reason

02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:42.080
Okay, it turns out you can't actually break the big killer things were oh

02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:46.480
I need to stop doing that. Okay. You're glowing blue. I need to remember

02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:51.280
Glowing blue. He's a friend to you. Oh, you're a fine warrior

02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:54.080
Oh, you're a warrior too

02:28:56.640 --> 02:28:58.640
Me I'm a warrior

02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:01.280
Even though I I get

02:29:01.280 --> 02:29:07.040
I get reeflings to kill everything. Is the dlc any good? I don't know. Oh, no, sorry. You said the dlc is good stuff

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.720
How utterly repellent this is I think the girl who haven't served her she was giving the shunt tails

02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:16.480
They're gonna play you know, I think they're swapping because there's issues with Ubisoft

02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:19.520
Wait, was that supposed to do something? Sorry? I don't know

02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:26.800
Uh-huh. I ask you call upon me the winds run foul with his uncertain father would permit me to fight

02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:29.040
Oh

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:36.480
Well, um, I've already got reeflings, but I do appreciate the offer. I really do. Please don't think I'm

02:29:37.840 --> 02:29:41.680
Not thankful, but um, I'm pretty solid to go. I'm not gonna lie

02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:49.120
I'm alive pretty solid you follow the jet follow the lanes. Oh, I would get kidnapped so easily. I'm not gonna lie

02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:54.240
Just exhaust the dialogue

02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:59.440
She gives you a charm too. Did I need to come back after I've done a godric

02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:04.720
She gives you something after you kill the boss at the round table. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Sorry reeflings. Sorry. Sorry

02:30:04.800 --> 02:30:08.080

You didn't have to actually leave. I don't know why we could do that. Oh, please candy

Uh, someone says the grass to the right

02:30:44.400 --> 02:30:47.040

Let me thy strength. Oh kindred

02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:28.000
Deliver me unto greater heights

02:31:32.640 --> 02:31:34.640
Well

02:31:42.240 --> 02:31:44.240

Reflings, please. Oh, thank god. Right. Okay. Now we can do it now. I have backup. I'm not scared

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:18.320

Thank goodness me. I have a lot of health. I don't I can't see who he's aiming for

02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:34.720
Am I being potato? Oh, it's been a while since I've played short

02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:39.680
Oh my god, absolute gang dialysis. I'm out the way

02:32:40.720 --> 02:32:42.720
Okay, I'm out of stamina

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Wait cut as we are

02:32:50.720 --> 02:32:53.840

02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:57.360
Oh

02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:02.960
I thought like that

02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:09.120
I've begun the wrong profit. We only knew it's running

02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:13.520
Oh my god, oh, I don't like this

02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:19.920
But I have to

02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:22.720
Ah

02:33:33.680 --> 02:33:35.680

How does this attack work? It's been so long, right? Okay

02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:52.240
Oh, does he if I stand on the scorch maybe

02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:58.480

02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:06.560
Me getting flattened like a pancake with the reeflings finish them off really just some it's going to sum up this entire stream. Let's go

02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:13.200
Oh no

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:15.680
I took my med

02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:19.040
I had to take my meds. I had a sore head. I'm so sorry

02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:25.360
Thank you. Thank you. You're the one who carried me through the ghost fight

02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:28.320
For the ghost fight. Wait, you guys don't disappear

02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:32.080
No

02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:35.520
I was like, wait many guys done the great rune by

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:41.840
The great runes you receive by the by defeating shard bearers have lost their

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:48.720
Beneficial power however their power can be restored at divine towers through the lands between sea

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:52.400
Oh, that's if you want to learn more spells and stuff. I think

02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:55.760
Is this another one where I can't see you guys here?

02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:00.800
Go to the round table and collect your rewards

02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:04.160
Can't level up yet. Okay round table

02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:10.480
Then I'll do it from there. Yes. No, okay round table. Wait. So I don't go back and talk to her

02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.560
Is she not going to be there anymore? Is she going to be at the round table? Oh

02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:24.160
Well, I'm gonna go to the round table. I didn't realize you guys even cleared that out for me. You guys did so much work

02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:28.720
I didn't even realize you clean cleared that out for me. Uh lady

02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:34.960
Warrior lady. Oh getting in. Hello. Oh, this is a rare occasion. Hi

02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:40.240
I can't remember the last time a new tarnished made their way to the round table. Yeah

02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:43.360
I'm new here as your senior

02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:48.720
Oh, no, we ain't doing that. Cool. Hi shit. No, we're on the same level. Sorry

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:55.600
I believe in communicating as peers and nothing more. Please don't don't give me that shit. Allow me a word of advice

02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:00.560
As your senior you are a mere visitor to the round table

02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:08.480
Okay, this is why we do peer and peer talking not like adult on child or like this like you're older than me

02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:10.480
I must respect your type. No

02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:13.120
Don't ever speak to me again

02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:15.360
Uh, oh, we can see the fingers

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:20.080
Hello

02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:32.800
The 43 levels from the logic

02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:37.520
We're so doing that first. What's Johnny's current level? It's like what? Only four more levels?

02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:42.960
Look there the fingers

02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:52.480
To welcome you shard bear let their wisdom wash over you

02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.600
Great Elden Ring

02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:58.800
Root of the golden order

02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:01.360
Anchor of all lands

02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:03.600
Giver of grace

02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:06.560
Wellspring of all joy

02:37:07.360 --> 02:37:09.360
Until it was shattered

02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:14.000
The tragic corruption of the order has taken its toll

02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:16.880
Across the realm

02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:18.880
Life lies in ruin

02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:21.680
Fallen two pieces

02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:24.560
foul curses

02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:26.720
And misery spread

02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:29.600
Unabating just so thank you

02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:32.560
What about this

02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:36.800
The tentacles trembles Johnny

02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:41.840
Wait my mouse was closed it again

02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:50.080
Oh

02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:56.480
Wait does the DLC get affected if you do the madness route or does the DLC kind of just override whatever choice?

02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:58.480
Of its kind

02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:06.320
Is DLC new game plus? Okay. That's my question. Is the DLC new game plus or are you supposed to do it alongside the main quest?

02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:10.880
DLC is separate entirely

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:14.480
This is one thing curious. Hello

02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:20.720
The rapture the rapture really of all things. I mean

02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:23.040
I

02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:30.320
No way they gave the fingers a seat no one feel well. This is what the damn thing size is

02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:35.760
Brian

02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.560
Since I was busy picking up a new family member dog in Texas

02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:47.280
Did you know they have a bank called central bank of texas my soul left my body when I abbreviated that

02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:53.520
Wait, what's wrong with the little you don't want central bank of texas texas?

02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:59.040
You don't want me a central bank of texas here. Just a little bit. I won't make it hurt too much

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.840
Thank you

02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:54.080
Who goes there identify yourself that wasn't mean you can't prove it

02:53:54.720 --> 02:53:55.600
Okay

02:53:55.600 --> 02:53:56.720
I'm almost finished

02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:02.240
Do you guys want to like go ahead a little bit just to get a feel for the enemies because I'm still trying to drink my tea

02:54:02.800 --> 02:54:04.800
Oh

02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:10.080
My god, I'm like, oh, it's like so hard to turn the camera and move

02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:14.800
I need to like make sure I'm behind the steps of the reefling though. So I don't get work

02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:18.000
Oh, that was a tiny bird. That was an eight out of ten

02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:22.560
That's not eight out of ten. That's like a four. That was a little a little

02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:27.600
Okay, okay, the reeflings are protected. I can do this

02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:36.640
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm following the reeflings with one hand. This is getting a bit tricky now

02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:40.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa

02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:49.760
Okay, okay, I finished I finished I finished I can pick up the map the map the map the map the map

02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:52.720
Um

02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:59.280
Oh my god, my game just froze there. Did you see that it literally just was

02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:09.120
I literally when things have too many bills. I cannot do it

02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:11.920
lie

02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:13.920
Nia

02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:18.880
Lie or Nia. Okay, that makes more sense. Sorry. I have to break everything down or else it doesn't work

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:21.760
In my head

02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:27.760
Lie or Nia. Oh, so good wrong. Okay, right. Okay. I still got it wrong still got it wrong

02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:32.240
Princess treatment mode literally right. I've got two hands again

02:55:33.840 --> 02:55:35.840
I'm ready for a fight

02:55:36.640 --> 02:55:39.600
Whoa, what did these do here? I don't like

02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:46.320
Whoa, help that reefling help that reefling right now. Oh, whoa

02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400
Oh

02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:53.520
That reefling didn't need any help at all actually in fact if anything I'm the one that needs help

02:55:55.920 --> 02:55:58.320
Why he's late now for fireworks?

02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:01.440
Baby

02:56:02.880 --> 02:56:07.120
Lie, you're Nia. Lie, you're Nia. Lie, you're Nia

02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:09.840
Yeah

02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:14.160
Making the reefling sell the dirty work. Well, the princess sits her tea honestly

02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:18.160
Shocking because he's like, wait, is that reefling fine? Yeah, that's reefling fine

02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:25.760
We're going on an adventure adventure adventure

02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:31.920
We're going on an adventure and the place of the map I can't pronounce

02:56:32.480 --> 02:56:35.920
So we're just gonna call it the lake but jeez you're so fast

02:56:37.120 --> 02:56:39.120
We're following the lake

02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:48.240
I got uh

02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:52.800
Flowers and I got uh smithing thingy my boba

02:56:54.400 --> 02:57:01.920
I like her friendly fires and on for friendly reeflings because I would be in a world of trouble swinging this sword around if you guys were getting physical

02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:04.560
Uh

02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:07.520
I don't know where we go

02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:19.440
Is there an enemy we're getting a bit too open world here

02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:26.640
I think there's some sort of boss battle in the water. Is it a boat? Is it the boat guy a mariner?

02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:34.240
Hmm my memory is failing me. Okay. This looks like a boss fight. Whatever this is. Okay, maybe not

02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:37.440
Maybe it's just the render distance

02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:45.840
So do you actually do the emboss in the dlc? Yeah, we've not played the dlc. I've never played it before I only came out two days ago

02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:48.640
Or are they?

02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:50.640
Whoa, I hear noises. Wow

02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:52.880
It's a baboon

02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:56.640
Cheeky thing. What do you drop? Do you drop string?

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
What?

02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:02.080
Here for replay

02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:05.440
Where are they coming from? They're coming out nowhere

02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:12.560
Oh my god, I love how long my sword is as well because it means I can actually hit things with it. What?

02:58:13.760 --> 02:58:17.040
Dragonfly. Oh no, not dragonfly. I'm mad at myself

02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:21.600
What do we do? I'm gonna follow you. Okay. Let's say we're all agree we're going this way

02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:27.040
What? Is it beating me up? I'm so confused. Is this thing trying to suck me off or something?

02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:32.320
I don't know. It keeps flapping about my head. I can't get it

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.560
I'm gonna beat this shit with that mosquito. Did you get it?

02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:40.240
No, it's being us

02:58:41.360 --> 02:58:47.200
We can't kill a mosquito. Okay. We did it. Okay. Let's god that thing is massive. That's a big

02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:54.320
Yeah, are you celebrating? Oh, I see it. I see it. Oh, it's gone

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:59.040
I thought that was the boss. Can he be the boss?

02:59:00.160 --> 02:59:04.720
Oh, I missed. You didn't see that. You didn't see that. I missed just a little bit. Okay

02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:10.240
Oh, I got more of my ovaries back. Yeah, give me my ovaries back. Give me the book

02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:13.680
I need them

02:59:14.240 --> 02:59:16.240
I need them for when uh

02:59:17.200 --> 02:59:19.200
Gentle

02:59:21.040 --> 02:59:27.120
Wow, okay, we're going up here. Oh, there's a great site and there's also a crystal bug

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
I love collecting all the flowers in this game

02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:32.880
Little mushrooms and all that. It's so cute

02:59:36.160 --> 02:59:38.160
Uh, right um

02:59:38.960 --> 02:59:40.960
Where are we to go?

02:59:41.040 --> 02:59:43.040
Look how freaking fast

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
It's so big

02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:51.520
Okay, I follow the reeflings. Where are they?

02:59:51.760 --> 02:59:57.760
Oh my god, they're gone. Oh, right. They're there. I was like, uh, did I just despawn them? Uh, uh reeflings help help help

02:59:59.440 --> 03:00:01.440
Okay

03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:05.760
I've heard the mosquito

03:00:07.680 --> 03:00:10.880
It's like, hmm, doesn't that seem a little overpowered just for that? Okay

03:00:13.680 --> 03:00:15.680
Anything

03:00:16.720 --> 03:00:19.920
Right, let's get ready to rumble

03:00:20.960 --> 03:00:22.960
Ladies and gentlemen

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:30.160
Aren't my feet getting cold in the water the lake? I feel like that'd be a bit chilly. Oh, there's a shack here. There's a house

03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:35.840
Reeflings, it's the farm. Oh no, our farm got flooded. We're gonna have to restore the farm together

03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:42.880
Oh, no, we're gonna have to put our love and joy into something and then and then when it's all finished

03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:46.000
And we're all happy and we'll be happy. Oh, no

03:00:46.880 --> 03:00:49.600
Oh, no, my ancestors the love

03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:58.480
I know I don't want to start anything. I'm sorry. I just thought I was curious that you were kicking so much food

03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:01.840
I hear boss music. I assume that's

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
the reason

03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:06.480
I can never as always

03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:10.720
Actually, it kind of sounds like the harry pot. Wait

03:01:11.440 --> 03:01:13.440
Is it harry pot or is it avenger?

03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:28.320
What one's that?

03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:31.840
Is that marvel? I think that's marvel

03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:36.800
Oh the avenger scene. Oh, that's what it is

03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:44.000
We're making the game thinks we're trying to hunt in this perfect one. I'm like, no, look at the third one

03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:50.400
We look one. Oh, there's a wee building to the left, Reeflings. There's a little thing to the left

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.160
Oh, that's a busty crust station or a crusty bust station. Okay

03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:03.520
What's the difference between uh, lobster with the boot job or something?

03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:05.920
I can't remember

03:02:17.120 --> 03:02:18.800
Thank you for the five

03:02:18.800 --> 03:02:20.080
uh, lunar sky wolf

03:02:20.080 --> 03:02:26.160
Brian says like there's actually a Brian tester if you do like if you take on Google like take speech

03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:29.040
um

03:02:29.520 --> 03:02:30.640
Twitter

03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:32.720
Twitter maybe like uh, don't know

03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:39.200
There's like a program that already has Brian and you can type in what you want to say to make sure he says it right

03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:45.360
Um, like sometimes you have to spell words a bit differently because Brian gets a little bit confused

03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:49.760
I'm I'm sure there's a joke and I've already forgotten it and I used to tell all the time

03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:54.640
And my dad's fucking sick of hearing it. It's like what's the difference between

03:02:55.600 --> 03:03:01.920
Oh, what's the difference between a dirty bus stop and a lobster with a boot job

03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:06.560
And then the answer is one

03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:09.440
A crusty

03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:14.320
Bus station and one's a busty crust station. Very good

03:03:15.760 --> 03:03:21.520
Ta-da, I don't know if my accent made that like 10 times harder than it needed to be to understand it. But yeah

03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:29.440
Yeah, what's the difference between old bus stop and a lobster with implants when it is a yeah, I said wait wait hold on hold on

03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:35.440
What's the difference between a dirty old bus station and a lobster with breast implants?

03:03:35.600 --> 03:03:39.120
One is a crusty bus station and the other is a busty crust station

03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:44.800
Oh, thank you. Thank you. It's a good joke. I love it

03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:47.760
Mmm

03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:55.120
Um, I made some clips yesterday after stream the youtube clip until but it's only a minute

03:03:56.160 --> 03:03:58.160
Uh, yes, it's still

03:03:58.720 --> 03:03:59.600
useful

03:03:59.600 --> 03:04:02.800
We are going to there's actually an anonymous person

03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:07.760
Who's been dropping us files on the girls like highlight files with the girls

03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:12.160
They made one for mercy and from not mistaken. They made one for

03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:15.120
Oh, it's the maidenless guy

03:04:15.920 --> 03:04:17.920
Uh, a highlight rule for Emmy

03:04:18.880 --> 03:04:24.800
But we're going to test of putting up like short three minute videos of a stream highlight and seeing how that gets received

03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:30.960
And if it does well or not, if not, then kind of clips that are for shorts only might be the best way

03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:36.880
Uh, what am I supposed to answer? Wait, hold on. Hold on

03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:42.800
Ah, there you are the great rune and had your audience with the two fingers. Yes, I did

03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:47.600
They didn't seem right

03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:50.160
I mean

03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:52.160
Fingers are the fingers

03:04:53.200 --> 03:04:56.160
You may go that made the wisdom of the two

03:04:57.840 --> 03:04:59.840
Oh, he's not happy

03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:02.960
Do his quest line it helps for DLC. Oh, sorry

03:05:03.920 --> 03:05:05.920
The two fingers seem off

03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:09.520
Your intuition serves you well

03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:13.920
My doubts had been piling up. You see

03:05:14.960 --> 03:05:21.520
The words of the two fingers cannot be trusted. What's the difference between a light bulb and the pregnant woman?

03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:23.920
You cannot screw light bulb

03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:30.880
Oh, brian will stand up comedian you are. Thank you tk for the five

03:05:32.640 --> 03:05:34.960
I appreciate it. Thanks for the needle

03:05:35.600 --> 03:05:42.560
Harbour no love. So this is how we do the dlc. That's the part that irks the most the fingers have no love

03:05:43.840 --> 03:05:45.840
Oh, I have a

03:05:46.560 --> 03:05:48.560
Festering bloody thing

03:05:48.560 --> 03:05:52.560
a means for circumventing the draw of the two fingers

03:05:53.440 --> 03:06:00.240
Give it a try. Won't you and if it please you may we meet again? You also need to do kaolin

03:06:00.240 --> 03:06:02.240
Hope's for you

03:06:02.400 --> 03:06:04.400
My mannequin

03:06:07.120 --> 03:06:13.360
That's what I had to do. Yeah, did I do it right? I need to go see him in kaolin

03:06:19.680 --> 03:06:26.480
What are you doing? Are you mottin gotta use the fingers a couple of times now

03:06:26.480 --> 03:06:28.480
I would do

03:06:29.840 --> 03:06:32.960
Look for bloody feral thing gods

03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:41.680
Well, can't agree to the go under my skin costume. I'm looking this one

03:06:45.680 --> 03:06:47.680
Uh

03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:54.400
Am I going crazy? Oh, it's right there at 10. Wait, I have to invade

03:06:56.640 --> 03:06:58.640
I

03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:01.040
Have to actually hurt people

03:07:02.720 --> 03:07:06.960
But I use the fingers and then talk to him again. Oh no

03:07:09.120 --> 03:07:13.840
You can just invade. Oh, I have so much points on me though. I don't want to lose my points

03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:16.640
That's my next level up

03:07:17.680 --> 03:07:19.680
The heck is this

03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:23.440
The ruse church and a little like a ruse church to me

03:07:24.400 --> 03:07:26.400
Where is the

03:07:28.240 --> 03:07:29.680
Question

03:07:29.680 --> 03:07:34.240
The strongy have a mean tag on play though. Yeah, I felt safe all up all wrong

03:07:34.880 --> 03:07:36.720
It's with an eight

03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:38.880
Right, we're just gonna do it

03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:43.280
I'm just gonna do it. So what you or can't use it. Why not?

03:07:44.160 --> 03:07:46.800
Right. Are you guys ready to watch me go attack some people?

03:07:48.560 --> 03:07:52.160
Or you can just do what the creepy maid almost did tell you

03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:56.400
You can kill magnus the beast thought and

03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:02.000
Wait and ride blood ruin instead. Don't have to do the same game. Wait. Who's that then?

03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:07.840
Magnus the beast claw that guy way at the end of the main games

03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:14.640
She does indeed yeah, I felt cephalopog wrong

03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:22.720
It's supposed to be cephalopog, but then I realized because I spelt it wrong. That's even more on par for me

03:08:24.400 --> 03:08:26.400
I

03:08:27.120 --> 03:08:30.960
It's an mpc in bed. Okay. Okay, right replays

03:08:32.320 --> 03:08:37.920
If you guys the spawn wait if I kill you right now replaying does that count?

03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:41.680
Are you want to sacrifice your flesh to mummy?

03:08:43.600 --> 03:08:49.680
I'm not gonna take your flesh. It's fine. I don't think it counts if I hurt you someone says it's an mpc in bed

03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:51.760
So I'm not gonna hurt you right

03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:57.600
Mmm, is that you offering yourself or is that you say no?

03:08:58.800 --> 03:09:03.600
Wait, I thought right so that kick the reef ones out and then use that for a finger

03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:08.480
You have to invade him can I invade you guys?

03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:19.320
Okay, right, okay get replays, please leave and then we're gonna skip to this next part go to the next grace

03:09:19.800 --> 03:09:21.160
Uh

03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:25.240
Yes, the next grace I know where that is. Yes. Uh the next grace. Yes

03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:28.520
Grace grace grace where follow the purple reef

03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:32.440
You know the finger is player

03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:35.400
Well

03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:38.760
Why don't we just give it a roll either? We'll win or lose. It's not really a big deal

03:09:39.400 --> 03:09:42.040
Considering how many runes you guys are feeding me

03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:51.480
I

03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:55.240
Losing still counts for the quick. Okay. Thank goodness. I was nervous

03:09:55.320 --> 03:10:02.200
It was one of those things where like you have to win against people who play this game and have a major interest in being

03:10:02.920 --> 03:10:04.920
Only

03:10:06.120 --> 03:10:08.120
Oh, there's a chair. Hello

03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:14.200
Ace rained atcha

03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:19.880
Is an hatch a hatch it would be better than what I have

03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:24.840
No, it's a different category. It's like a magic type thing

03:10:25.880 --> 03:10:30.600
It causes frost build up though. Oh, I do like to get past them a bit

03:10:31.640 --> 03:10:33.640
What's wrong?

03:10:33.800 --> 03:10:37.560
Oh, it's just terrible and everything though. I just get worse

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:40.520
um

03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:46.040
Okay, we're we're doing something. I don't know where the next three players follow the purple reef going

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:54.600
Magnificent later on when you go up an elevator out. Oh, we're getting a little lean

03:10:59.880 --> 03:11:04.040
I see it. Okay. So claim this and then go to pvp and then

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
Wait, how come?

03:11:11.480 --> 03:11:17.080
Okay, so now I click on the finger

03:11:21.160 --> 03:11:23.160
Oh, no, this can't be

03:11:25.080 --> 03:11:27.080
Invasion

03:11:27.160 --> 03:11:29.160
Bose

03:11:29.720 --> 03:11:31.720
Uh, wait for old finger use

03:11:33.080 --> 03:11:37.880
Uh, attempting to evade another word select the bones both near and far

03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:40.840
Yes

03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:49.880
Uh

03:11:54.760 --> 03:11:59.880
It might take forever my internet crash trip

03:11:59.960 --> 03:12:01.960
Oh

03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:08.360
No, wait, I I debuff myself because I

03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:13.240
How do I undo it

03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:17.400
How do I undo that?

03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:23.400
Here you are

03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:28.280
Oh, no, it's only going to put me against swiss because it's like, oh you're level kabillion

03:12:29.880 --> 03:12:34.040
You're so high level. You're not going to get any matches. So how high level am I? Oh, no

03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:37.800
Okay

03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:41.080
If that's the case, we might as well just enjoy the

03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:44.520
I don't know how to reset it

03:12:50.120 --> 03:12:52.520
Do you think if someone's gonna think I'm a swear

03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:55.800
What did that do

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000
Do anything

03:12:59.080 --> 03:13:02.440
Severed finger or rest of the grace. Okay rest of the grace

03:13:08.200 --> 03:13:11.320
Okay, so the npc's in game count however

03:13:17.080 --> 03:13:24.120
Uh, I don't know what thing takes me out of it though. Um, um, um, I don't know where the furrow finger is

03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:28.600
Hopefully it's a replay

03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:31.720
Oh, no

03:13:33.640 --> 03:13:35.640
I'm in limb grave

03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:42.440
Things don't hurt me

03:13:43.480 --> 03:13:45.480
Wait refling

03:13:46.520 --> 03:13:49.720
Hi, I don't I don't want to hurt you

03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:53.560
Refling

03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:56.520
No

03:13:56.600 --> 03:13:58.600
No, I'm not fighting

03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:06.600
No, I don't want to fight. Holy stinking. Let me leave. That's it use can't use

03:14:11.400 --> 03:14:14.440
Uh, I don't know what I am. Let's me read

03:14:16.600 --> 03:14:18.600
I just honestly know a big deal. I'm not paying

03:14:19.160 --> 03:14:21.160
Uh

03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:28.680
Use the finger

03:14:30.200 --> 03:14:32.200
I genuinely

03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:36.520
Not the famous Ion use the finger

03:14:45.320 --> 03:14:47.320
Under monitor menu

03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:51.160
This

03:14:52.760 --> 03:14:57.080
Oh, whoa, what are you doing, bro? Let me go. Let me go. What the fuck?

03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:02.360
Man, don't be a bunch of pussies. Just let me read

03:15:10.040 --> 03:15:16.520
Uh, I don't actually want to fight. Okay, that took me so long. I do apologize for that. Holy, they're so weak

03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:23.000
I'm so overpowered. Why would the game put me in with them? I feel bad. Right. So that counts as one

03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:31.400
So do it all over again. You need to do it two more times, right both near and far. Okay

03:15:33.480 --> 03:15:35.480
Do it three times

03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:39.240
I I love that due to your huge, uh

03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:41.880
Vigor they couldn't kill you

03:15:42.280 --> 03:15:44.680
They aren't used to have people having that much xp

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:51.080
Yeah, so even though I'm like mega leveled off, I guess they didn't really hear that much

03:15:54.360 --> 03:15:58.760
I thought yeah, because I thought the servers were going to be like, no, wait a minute

03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:06.200
No way those flowers are nasturtiums

03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:13.160
I recognize the lily pad leaves and flower color from anywhere. We're literally on nasturtiums. Look at the lily pad leaf

03:16:15.320 --> 03:16:20.600
No way we're on nasturtiums. That's so cute. I didn't even know they had them in this game

03:16:22.680 --> 03:16:29.080
Okay, I press star I press multi player. I press the finger. Whoa, that was a bit too quick

03:16:29.960 --> 03:16:33.320
I press star and then I get the heck out of here. Bye

03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:35.720
Hi

03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:44.600
So level 200 and like zero plus weapon you're matching people with similar levels and weapons

03:16:48.440 --> 03:16:52.200
So that counted one more time one more time

03:16:53.960 --> 03:16:54.760
You know what it is

03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:59.000
I think they're matching you with people with the game weapons current upgrades

03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:03.400
So they basically can't even hurt you with their stats. Okay, that's funny

03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:06.520
I'll take that. I'll take that

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:10.280
Are the girls streaming? Did they manage to do that club?

03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:19.560
Who knew my underpowered weaponry was all like that

03:17:21.800 --> 03:17:25.880
Oh, that's a block with this honestly

03:17:29.480 --> 03:17:32.200
That holds down. No that holds down

03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:36.040
No, it just looks like a weird power stance thing

03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:43.240
How is that an ulti? Is it boosted? Oh, it's boosting me. It's giving me a boost. I can see the gold on me

03:17:49.080 --> 03:17:51.720
I think you can only have a 20 plus or below

03:17:51.720 --> 03:17:53.720
Okay

03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:07.080
Okay, we only need one more I boost your poise too, which is why it stopped you getting staggered. Oh

03:18:09.560 --> 03:18:12.060
Stomped then heavy attack it does a follow-up

03:18:13.020 --> 03:18:15.020
Oh

03:18:16.220 --> 03:18:24.460
That's so sad. It's fine. Let's try it out. I'm feeling confident after those those two people tried to beat me up

03:18:25.980 --> 03:18:27.980
Right, so give them a stomp

03:18:31.340 --> 03:18:33.340
Oh

03:18:34.300 --> 03:18:36.300
Oh

03:18:40.940 --> 03:18:43.260
No, I don't want to fight you now you got too much HP

03:18:44.780 --> 03:18:48.380
Oh wait, am I going to stop searching for enemies if I mock it up

03:18:49.100 --> 03:18:53.100
If I start up face if I start beating people up, I might even go have any

03:18:54.700 --> 03:18:56.700
Why is there always

03:18:57.340 --> 03:18:59.340
He doesn't like it

03:18:59.900 --> 03:19:01.900
Necessary eight on my head

03:19:02.860 --> 03:19:05.420
Necessary out my head, but be wary of strong four

03:19:10.620 --> 03:19:13.260
You can just do a light attack near the critical area

03:19:15.020 --> 03:19:17.020
Yeah, I'm still searching it better be

03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:20.460
What is it coming over?

03:19:21.900 --> 03:19:23.900
I don't know like it looks like it's giving up

03:19:24.620 --> 03:19:28.700
Come on. We need one more world to invade right. Let's admire the nasturtians

03:19:28.940 --> 03:19:33.260
The reason my nasturtiums are so awesome is they can actually grow in really poor soil quality

03:19:33.580 --> 03:19:39.340
Something so beautiful can start from uh, even without the best conditions just like a weekend

03:19:43.500 --> 03:19:46.540
As no one is perfect and you don't have to be

03:19:47.660 --> 03:19:49.660
You get nasturtiums are like that too

03:19:50.460 --> 03:19:53.900
And they have lots of big green leaves to get all the nutrition for their pollen

03:19:54.140 --> 03:19:58.620
Their seeds are actually really interesting. They have very round bulbous seeds like in a circular

03:19:59.100 --> 03:20:02.460
Seed it's actually really pretty to watch seeds of an nasturtium form

03:20:03.660 --> 03:20:04.940
Um

03:20:04.940 --> 03:20:08.780
I'm gonna go try and sleep. I'll try and join when I wake up, which will be the next stream

03:20:09.180 --> 03:20:13.740
Considering we're only uh, what the three of our mark. I'll see you when you wake up. Okay

03:20:15.500 --> 03:20:18.860
If anyone goes to sleep probably after the what

03:20:20.140 --> 03:20:23.740
Five hour mark, then maybe I might not be able to see you

03:20:24.460 --> 03:20:27.500
But after that I should

03:20:28.780 --> 03:20:34.060
Um, I will get some uh actual food. I have been

03:20:34.780 --> 03:20:40.460
So clogged up. I'm starting to get annoying the reason why I'm meme about animals so much

03:20:41.020 --> 03:20:44.540
It's because I'm like two steps away from giving myself a freaking animal

03:20:46.140 --> 03:20:51.180
And because I'm getting sick good night. Sorry. That's probably the last thing you want to hear before you're about to go to sleep

03:20:51.180 --> 03:20:53.180
We're gonna have dreams about you

03:20:54.460 --> 03:20:55.420
Sorry

03:20:55.420 --> 03:20:59.980
The plan is to skip sleeping. No, you don't need to skip. We're literally doing this back to back to back to back

03:21:00.300 --> 03:21:02.300
I have told the girls

03:21:02.380 --> 03:21:07.420
Well, I've actually not told them. I probably should put a message in the discord and just be like

03:21:07.900 --> 03:21:12.540
But once Amy goes away on holiday, this is her last stream. So I'm gonna I'm gonna send her a nice dm

03:21:13.100 --> 03:21:18.300
I'm just gonna thank her for all her hard work. She uh earns. She has rightfully earned her vacation

03:21:19.020 --> 03:21:23.020
Um, she's done a few things in the background to make sure the pinpals are well fed

03:21:23.420 --> 03:21:26.460
And then after that, I'm just gonna put a message in the discord and just say

03:21:27.020 --> 03:21:27.820
Hi

03:21:27.820 --> 03:21:29.260
strongy here

03:21:29.260 --> 03:21:33.180
I'm playing with the reef links for the next foreseeable day week

03:21:33.580 --> 03:21:39.100
Uh, do not interrupt me. I couldn't care less if you get yourself in trouble. You're an adult deal with the consequences

03:21:39.500 --> 03:21:41.020
sent

03:21:41.020 --> 03:21:46.620
That's what they're getting from me. That's literally all they're getting from me. You will deal with the consequences of your actions

03:21:47.420 --> 03:21:53.740
By yourself. Bye. I'm not your I am not your mom. Do not come to be for an answer. I am with the reef links. Bye

03:21:55.420 --> 03:21:57.420
That's it. That's all they're getting

03:21:59.260 --> 03:22:01.580
Yeah, this has been a long time coming

03:22:02.700 --> 03:22:09.740
To do elven main and get the dlc together, which is so fantastic. So quick we get to do the dlc as well

03:22:11.740 --> 03:22:13.660
Um

03:22:13.660 --> 03:22:16.220
Yeah, I actually need to put up my screen for tomorrow

03:22:17.580 --> 03:22:22.700
What is going on with that? There's like some weird mirage effect going on with my

03:22:23.820 --> 03:22:27.020
Oh, come on. Just invade one more person one more

03:22:27.500 --> 03:22:31.180
It's turning into a bout rule run one more. Please read things one more

03:22:33.020 --> 03:22:35.020
Sorry, I'm gonna make some emotions like

03:22:36.700 --> 03:22:39.740
I did the melena cosplay you saw the castello

03:22:40.140 --> 03:22:41.100
Oh

03:22:41.100 --> 03:22:44.140
Sorry, I missed you. I do apologize to anyone who

03:22:44.860 --> 03:22:48.620
I can't grab but please don't worry. I'm playing for the next like literally five days or something

03:22:50.220 --> 03:22:52.220
Uh

03:22:52.700 --> 03:22:57.260
Let's going up staying up all night with mommy only if it's healthy and you don't have work or something

03:22:57.420 --> 03:23:01.420
Is that a weekend? I don't know to get to the dlc. You have to finish this quest

03:23:02.380 --> 03:23:03.580
Mog

03:23:03.580 --> 03:23:05.580
We need to mog mohoog

03:23:06.060 --> 03:23:12.060
And then go to kaolin and kill radahan. Yes, we can absolutely do that. Oh, I do not like that radahan

03:23:17.580 --> 03:23:22.140
I have kayaking with my dad at seven from you would be sharp

03:23:24.540 --> 03:23:32.140
It will be absolutely oh, come on one more. Give me one more. Come on game. Give it to me game

03:23:32.700 --> 03:23:34.700
Show it to me, please

03:23:40.460 --> 03:23:42.460
Try it again

03:23:49.580 --> 03:23:51.580
Come on, I want to play with my reef lens

03:23:53.420 --> 03:23:56.620
Get them servers up right no

03:23:57.340 --> 03:23:59.340
And put me in someone's

03:24:00.140 --> 03:24:07.580
Silly we game so I can immediately leave and meet the requirements of the silly maidless twat bag

03:24:19.020 --> 03:24:25.420

Scared mom is a thing. Yeah. Okay, let's get on torrent

03:34:00.220 --> 03:34:03.900

We'll just be line it. There's no such thing as enemies. They're not real

03:34:11.180 --> 03:34:14.780
And it's not just because I'm scared that I don't have my briefings with me

03:34:16.700 --> 03:34:18.700
Um

03:34:18.700 --> 03:34:21.900

A little to the left again

03:34:33.180 --> 03:34:35.180
We're drifting course a little bit

03:34:35.980 --> 03:34:38.380
That's okay because it's not always linear

03:34:39.340 --> 03:34:43.100
That's like life life isn't linear either. Ah

Are you ready for the two-handed? Oh something's happening. Is he gone?

03:48:17.020 --> 03:48:19.020

03:49:05.980 --> 03:49:07.980
Selfless is the description

03:49:08.780 --> 03:49:15.980
If english isn't your first language, it kind of sounds like the word selfish, but it's opposite. It's selfless

03:49:18.140 --> 03:49:20.140
So don't worry if you get a bit confused

03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:25.980
The english language is a little bit like that where it sounds so a rolling girl for gen 2

03:49:26.140 --> 03:49:29.340
I'll just have a boulder for gen 2. Just a rock

03:49:31.020 --> 03:49:33.020
Um

03:49:33.020 --> 03:49:35.500
Yeah, I got a third concept back. I quite like it

03:49:36.460 --> 03:49:38.460
A few tweaks

03:49:40.860 --> 03:49:42.860
And the things are heating up

03:49:44.060 --> 03:49:46.300
And by that I just mean it's just concept art

03:49:47.580 --> 03:49:49.580
You don't have to get too scared

03:49:50.620 --> 03:49:52.620
Uh

03:49:53.340 --> 03:49:57.100
This girl, what's a siphoth a rock, but not a slime

03:49:57.900 --> 03:50:03.660
How dare you okay? I open the tip. I open the tip. I have an imbecile

03:50:03.980 --> 03:50:05.980
So ward key

03:50:05.980 --> 03:50:12.940
I am struggling with english today. Thank you for not making fun of me when I pronounce stuff wrong by accident

03:50:13.580 --> 03:50:19.100
And like sometimes I'll be funny with a word, but I have to admit sometimes it just comes out all wrong

03:50:19.180 --> 03:50:23.100
But like you guys don't make fun of me and I actually I'm quite pleased to put it in this one

03:50:25.180 --> 03:50:27.340
Take it take my imbecile key

03:50:28.380 --> 03:50:30.380
Are you teabagging me?

03:50:30.700 --> 03:50:32.700
Oh

03:50:33.020 --> 03:50:40.140
Did it work? Wait, what it's not gonna work. Thank you. Thank you

03:50:41.580 --> 03:50:44.700
Uh, wait, it doesn't activate

03:50:46.220 --> 03:50:50.140
Is it because you guys are here wait, I'm not going crazy. Did I not finger this?

03:50:50.460 --> 03:50:56.860
Uh, I think you guys you have to do it solo. Oh, don't say such don't say such mean things to me

03:50:57.820 --> 03:51:01.500
Don't say such terrible. No, no, no

03:51:03.020 --> 03:51:10.780
You can just go press star and then multiplayer and then the fingers in there. You don't have to do it like that reflin

03:51:11.500 --> 03:51:13.500
You don't have to do it like that

03:51:15.340 --> 03:51:20.700
Just use the multiplayer finger press star and go multiplayer and use this that's how you leave

03:51:20.780 --> 03:51:24.140
You don't have to do that. Don't do that. Make me upset ease again

03:51:25.100 --> 03:51:27.100
Ah here

03:51:27.580 --> 03:51:31.340
I don't know where the heck we're going because you guys just holding my hand so fair people

03:51:31.740 --> 03:51:33.740
Just means I get to ramble a lot

03:51:33.980 --> 03:51:37.660
Huh, what's that? You're tired to hear my voice. Can't really anyway. No

03:51:38.620 --> 03:51:40.620
chapel of anticipation

03:51:43.580 --> 03:51:45.580
Oh

03:51:46.140 --> 03:51:48.620
Oh don't need to do this fight alone

03:52:13.500 --> 03:52:15.500
Well, I don't seem to have it

03:52:15.900 --> 03:52:17.900
Okay, well

03:52:18.940 --> 03:52:20.940

Okay, swing swing. I'm trying to figure out what the attack bar it is

03:53:17.340 --> 03:53:19.340
I didn't know you could do that move

03:53:21.500 --> 03:53:23.500
Oh my god, you're almost on the center

03:53:25.260 --> 03:53:30.540
Your hp in my bar is all I have. I didn't know he could thrust like that

03:53:33.100 --> 03:53:35.100
Fuck

03:53:36.060 --> 03:53:38.620
We're both swinging for fucking lanes here

03:53:39.660 --> 03:53:41.660
I'm out of stamina shit

03:53:41.820 --> 03:53:46.540
Oh, no, what is that? What does that mean? What does that mean? What does that mean? He's used an incantation

03:53:47.500 --> 03:53:49.500
But I don't know what it means

03:53:49.660 --> 03:53:51.660
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

03:53:51.660 --> 03:53:53.660

03:54:09.820 --> 03:54:11.820

03:54:13.180 --> 03:54:15.180
Wait, wait, that's where it came from

03:54:16.300 --> 03:54:18.300
Wait, what?

03:54:20.220 --> 03:54:22.220
What do I do? Wait, is this all?

03:54:23.100 --> 03:54:28.540
And only a hundred levels higher than the recommended. No, that's where you go and go there. You got this. Okay. Okay. Thank you

03:54:29.500 --> 03:54:33.340
Ah revenge. I did get my revenge fellow tarnish

So I guess if you kill him

03:54:37.740 --> 03:54:39.740
Before he does the scream or whatever

03:54:40.140 --> 03:54:44.300
You softlock yourself and you have to jump off the map anyway. Ooh, what's up here?

03:54:45.820 --> 03:54:47.820
I love exploring

03:54:48.060 --> 03:54:49.900
The storm hawk

Hey

03:54:50.780 --> 03:54:52.780

03:54:52.780 --> 03:54:54.780

03:54:54.940 --> 03:54:56.940
Even more curious. Hello

03:54:57.580 --> 03:54:59.580
What are you?

03:54:59.820 --> 03:55:01.820
Summoning spirits

03:55:01.820 --> 03:55:03.820
I can know summon

03:55:04.620 --> 03:55:06.220
storm hawk

03:55:06.220 --> 03:55:08.220
Dean

03:55:08.380 --> 03:55:10.860
Doesn't sound like a very bird friendly name, but sure

03:55:11.820 --> 03:55:13.820
Jump the ledge

03:55:14.460 --> 03:55:15.980
Wee

03:55:15.980 --> 03:55:17.980
Angle back into the

03:55:23.900 --> 03:55:25.900
Die clothed with maiden's blood

03:55:26.860 --> 03:55:28.860
Oh

03:55:29.500 --> 03:55:33.180
Yeah, you don't look too whole. Are you feeling okay? Who perished you?

03:55:34.140 --> 03:55:36.140
Did that guy perish right?

03:55:36.140 --> 03:55:37.580
Yes

03:55:37.580 --> 03:55:39.580
Wait, how are people dying?

03:55:42.620 --> 03:55:46.620
Hmm back to very

03:55:48.940 --> 03:55:52.460
Which is here, so I need to keep doing the horse stuff, but that's okay

03:55:52.940 --> 03:55:59.580
That's your original maiden? Not millennia

03:56:03.820 --> 03:56:05.820
Now we do a meme marker

03:56:08.620 --> 03:56:10.620
Oh, I forgot I can swing on horse

03:56:16.140 --> 03:56:18.620
Do it slowly you need to pick up an item on teleport

03:56:19.180 --> 03:56:27.340
She was your original maiden, but she died before you awoke so millennia adopted me

03:56:31.020 --> 03:56:33.020
Ah

03:56:33.980 --> 03:56:40.380
Well, I have a blood soaked brag so I go talk to mr. Barry or bear. Sorry

03:56:40.620 --> 03:56:42.620
Oh

My god, my first sword is spanking the horse of torrent. That's not very nice before see he's just trying his best

03:56:53.100 --> 03:56:57.980
Oh, I heard that I hear that something's lurking in the shadows. I hear it

03:56:59.660 --> 03:57:04.780
A dead maiden I heard a torrent link it's torrent a reef link

03:57:05.420 --> 03:57:07.420
Oh

03:57:09.020 --> 03:57:11.020
Dead maiden on

03:57:13.180 --> 03:57:15.820
Okay, let's uh go off

03:57:17.420 --> 03:57:21.900
And then speak to the mr. Hello, ah my lambkin

03:57:23.260 --> 03:57:30.460
You've completed your final trial. Uh-huh and with this you are a formal inductee

03:57:31.420 --> 03:57:39.020
A knight who will assist luminary mog the lord of blood in the establishment of a new dynasty

03:57:39.740 --> 03:57:41.180
now

03:57:41.180 --> 03:57:43.180
Give me your finger

03:57:43.180 --> 03:57:48.780
This noble blood will be an immutable badge of honor once it settles

03:57:49.740 --> 03:57:51.740
Inside of you

03:57:54.060 --> 03:57:56.060
I guess I give him my finger

03:58:00.620 --> 03:58:04.700
Um, this is kind of scary. What does the blood do to me though?

03:58:06.300 --> 03:58:10.220
Thank goodness. This is a video game and not real life. It sounds like he's giving me a STD

03:58:11.820 --> 03:58:14.940
The toenail moment is wait. He's taking it off

03:58:25.020 --> 03:58:27.020
He's taking my fingernail

03:58:27.260 --> 03:58:31.020
Good heavens clench your teeth or something

03:58:34.460 --> 03:58:36.460
He took my fingernail

03:58:38.540 --> 03:58:46.380
Never forget that feeling of agony for it is what binds you to luminary mog to all of us

03:58:50.300 --> 03:58:54.780
You have the sweetest scream my lambkin

03:58:55.500 --> 03:59:00.860
Is that the only oh another thing you should have this

03:59:05.580 --> 03:59:09.100
A medal granted by the new mogwin dynasty

03:59:09.820 --> 03:59:13.260
With the power to grant audience with luminary mog

03:59:13.980 --> 03:59:17.100
I've gone out of my way to provide one to you

03:59:17.820 --> 03:59:19.820
But you mustn't use it just yet

03:59:20.780 --> 03:59:24.620
The meeting must wait until the mogwin dynasty commences

03:59:25.500 --> 03:59:29.180
Luminary mog yet slumbers beside the divinity

03:59:29.980 --> 03:59:33.100
We must endure a little longer

03:59:34.860 --> 03:59:36.860
Uh

03:59:37.740 --> 03:59:40.380
Use it use the inventory

03:59:42.060 --> 03:59:45.100
You go to the audience grounds

03:59:46.540 --> 03:59:48.540
Okay

03:59:48.540 --> 03:59:50.540

03:59:51.580 --> 03:59:54.540
I have no idea. This is no stuff. I don't know

03:59:56.140 --> 03:59:58.780
Is there a safe site so I can call in the reeflings like right now?

04:00:02.620 --> 04:00:10.300
I'm scared there's noises and I don't recognize it and I'm all alone. Oh no, I'm so scared

04:00:10.300 --> 04:00:12.300
Oh

Oh, please don't attack me anything. I'm too scared. I'm just a baby

04:00:29.980 --> 04:00:35.260
Please tell me the reeflings can spawn in here. Oh, I don't like this not one bit. I'm sorry

04:00:36.620 --> 04:00:38.860
I don't recognize it. Can I live a lot maybe?

04:00:40.860 --> 04:00:42.860
No, I can't live a lot

04:00:43.820 --> 04:00:51.180
Okay last increase the replenish rate do it again. No, I only had one

04:01:38.940 --> 04:01:40.940

No, wait, there's only been wait. How many precedences are being?

04:01:47.260 --> 04:01:52.540
I don't know how many presents I need an enemy reefling or because we're about to do a boss fight. We should be fine

04:01:55.020 --> 04:01:58.780
46 ish. Yeah, let's see like 65 but that's not correct

04:02:00.060 --> 04:02:03.100
Oh hero ran money money, okay

We've not had you have we

04:02:14.540 --> 04:02:16.540
A changeling

04:02:17.820 --> 04:02:22.220
Are you the one that had reefling is your name and I've just been debated

04:02:24.300 --> 04:02:28.700
There are still a ways before the boss fight my thought is he looks like a

04:02:29.900 --> 04:02:32.140
A newbie from anime

04:02:33.500 --> 04:02:40.140
Well, like the protagonist and then like the the the main girl is like a smoking hot babe. Hello everything

Oh my god, they have so much hp

04:03:10.620 --> 04:03:16.140
Okay, not attacking not attacking do not engage. I repeat reeflings. Do not engage do not engage

04:03:16.620 --> 04:03:18.620
They have insane hp amounts

04:03:19.180 --> 04:03:22.060
I maybe need to think about upgrading my weapons to be honest

04:03:22.860 --> 04:03:26.380
Do not engage uh, uh, maybe engage in this

04:03:27.340 --> 04:03:29.340
So

Servers are probably going nuts for how many players are on right now. Not gonna lie

04:04:04.540 --> 04:04:10.540
Have you made it to the dlc? I think that's what's happening right now little reefling

04:08:53.100 --> 04:08:55.100
Oh

04:08:59.260 --> 04:09:01.740
Welcome honor the guest

04:09:03.660 --> 04:09:06.940
To the birthplace of our

04:09:07.900 --> 04:09:09.900
dynasty

04:09:09.900 --> 04:09:15.180
I committed myself to you. You don't need to attack me. Good sir. Oh dear fucking lord. I'm scared

04:09:16.140 --> 04:09:18.140
We feeling

04:09:20.460 --> 04:09:25.340
Oh my god, right. They're coming they're coming. It's fine. Bring the guards. Bring the guards the guards and should be rang

04:09:26.460 --> 04:09:28.300
Okay

04:09:28.300 --> 04:09:30.300
Okay

04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:33.660
I've completely forgotten his attack card. I'm gonna be honest

04:09:38.940 --> 04:09:40.940
I have completely forgotten the strip

04:09:45.980 --> 04:09:47.980
Right

04:10:03.180 --> 04:10:06.140
Did he just call it a jewel it's a jewel

04:10:08.220 --> 04:10:10.540
Well, we wear a trio and then you ruined it

04:10:11.260 --> 04:10:15.420
Fuckin hell president Nixon you're actually teaming troops. I'm not gonna lie

04:10:26.540 --> 04:10:29.020
Oh my god, he hit me in two

04:10:30.540 --> 04:10:32.540
He's counting

04:10:32.540 --> 04:10:35.980
We're getting a free countdown. Don't you have to pay for that kind of content?

04:10:41.260 --> 04:10:43.260
I

04:10:45.020 --> 04:10:48.860
May need a potion did you upgrade your sword?

04:10:50.540 --> 04:10:53.340
Why have a chat bring her here because they're gonna carry me

04:10:55.500 --> 04:11:00.860
Are you guys up here or are you back at that grace site? Can I summon you out here? Is anyone here?

04:11:03.500 --> 04:11:05.500
Oh, there are leaflings up here

04:11:06.140 --> 04:11:12.460
You don't have any items for damage reduction here. I got a crab leg

04:11:14.060 --> 04:11:22.620
Okay, this is gonna take a few attempts. Please don't worry. Please remain seated for the rest of this ride. Um

04:11:24.140 --> 04:11:26.140
Wait, did I not come you in? Yeah, I did

04:11:27.500 --> 04:11:31.020
Uh, there's a flask tier that counters that one move

04:11:31.820 --> 04:11:37.980
Should I just like hold back and let president nixon do it because I'm gonna be honest president nixon didn't even get hit

04:11:39.100 --> 04:11:44.860
Hi lord, you've not done a boss battle. Milena. You've definitely not fought with us

04:11:46.060 --> 04:11:51.100
Okay, I might just hold back and see if the leaflings can do it once we're all in

04:11:53.020 --> 04:11:55.180
Definitely my a little crap leg though

04:11:56.540 --> 04:12:00.700
Yeah, president nixon. I'm not gonna lie. I don't think I see him got hit one

04:12:01.900 --> 04:12:03.020
I

04:12:03.020 --> 04:12:07.820
Know ironically there was a point on the stream where I got distracted and stood suddenly strong

04:12:07.820 --> 04:12:10.860
He says we fling and I responded out loud if that was my name. No, I'm

04:12:11.580 --> 04:12:17.660
Stop that's the cutest thing ever. I love that kind of corruption. Holy crap. It's not even corruption. That's just like straight up love

04:12:17.660 --> 04:12:21.580
Stop. I love that. Hi. Are you doing a little parallel thing? Right? Are you guys ready?

04:12:22.460 --> 04:12:27.420
Um, I might hold back. Maybe I should invest in like long range weapon do

04:12:27.900 --> 04:12:34.300
You still get hit even if you run away. Stop. It's an aoe across the whole pitch

04:12:35.420 --> 04:12:41.020
Oh my my runes. Uh, sorry mr. Bloodman. I know this is really important fight, but wow

04:12:43.340 --> 04:12:45.340
Oh, I don't recall

04:12:45.980 --> 04:12:49.420
I don't want to be a little pussy though. I'm put my poor leaflings to the pair

04:12:52.300 --> 04:12:54.300
He makes it rain down with mud

04:12:55.260 --> 04:12:57.260
And he's like throwing it everywhere

04:13:07.900 --> 04:13:13.100
It was fun being someone embarrassing to immediately die a moment. Oh, is that you?

04:13:15.820 --> 04:13:18.220
That's funny you say anything though. Thank you for the

04:13:18.940 --> 04:13:20.940
Oh

04:13:26.140 --> 04:13:34.060
No, no president Nixon the 46th president of the united states. Where are you when we need you?

04:13:34.620 --> 04:13:36.620
Is it just me?

04:13:37.660 --> 04:13:39.660
Is it just me?

04:13:39.980 --> 04:13:41.980
Okay, no

04:13:42.940 --> 04:13:48.140
Okay, okay. Okay. This is gonna take a few attempts. I don't really think I'm gonna break them people's names

04:13:48.220 --> 04:13:56.380
When it comes to a boss fight. Thank you so much maths one six one eight to be so specific for the super chat. Don't be embarrassed

04:13:57.100 --> 04:13:58.620
and

04:13:58.620 --> 04:14:01.500
This is a tricky one come to the top of the elevator

04:14:02.220 --> 04:14:05.980
out of morgues fight and we're just gonna try our best

04:14:07.020 --> 04:14:13.020
Literally do not be embarrassed about failing because um, I'm literally so over leveled for this

04:14:13.500 --> 04:14:14.860
I'll try and

04:14:14.860 --> 04:14:21.500
Do uh different things, but I won't count your name against a boss fight just because it's

04:14:22.300 --> 04:14:27.180
I have no idea like how many times this is gonna take should be honest

04:14:27.740 --> 04:14:30.860
Is this the dlc or not? We're trying to access the dlc

04:14:31.260 --> 04:14:37.900
We are outside of mark wins dynasty mausoleum, but we need to kill him in order to access the dlc section

04:14:37.980 --> 04:14:39.980
I'm under the impression

04:14:41.020 --> 04:14:43.020
And come hi

04:14:43.980 --> 04:14:46.940

This is gonna take a few this is gonna take a few attempts. Okay. I can't say I don't want spoilers

04:14:53.900 --> 04:14:56.540
Yes, there will be spoilers for the dlc

Okay, I missed a little bit. Hold on. Let me try again. Okay. I missed a bit. Okay. That was just based then

Maybe I can pick up my soles again. I mean, it's not the biggest deal if I lose them

04:16:30.460 --> 04:16:33.260
Do you guys have that dragon breath attack?

04:16:35.660 --> 04:16:37.660
Oh

Okay, I'm gonna back off I need to back off. Sorry. Oh, like I don't want to leave you guys to fight them on your own

04:17:48.700 --> 04:17:53.300
Like you need. Oh my god. Look at that killer worm. Did you see the worm? I

04:17:55.860 --> 04:18:03.260
Just like it. Okay. I'm gonna hold back as much as it pains me to watch you guys do all the heavy lifting like all the time

04:18:04.620 --> 04:18:07.500
I'm gonna see if there's anyone I don't recognize

04:18:08.740 --> 04:18:13.540
You have been in but you were very early. Oh just straight up rear

04:18:14.620 --> 04:18:16.620
Not had you

04:18:17.620 --> 04:18:19.620
Hey, what a funny name

04:18:20.380 --> 04:18:24.500
Please again, don't worry. I'm not gonna like hold this against you

04:18:24.500 --> 04:18:27.340
I have like a separate list and it's called boss fight

04:18:27.740 --> 04:18:29.740
So I have your name

04:18:30.620 --> 04:18:38.140
So I know not to be like what worm there was like a loading screen blue neon worm. Are you guys ready to carry me?

04:18:38.860 --> 04:18:41.460
Oh, you want this one too? You want this one too?

04:18:42.340 --> 04:18:49.020
This is our pre-war ritual if you didn't know most there was like some sort of rituals normally for like back in the day

04:18:49.020 --> 04:18:52.100
Where you go a war it would be like a send-off party

04:18:52.100 --> 04:18:58.740
It would be everyone getting drunk and plastered it'd be this it'd be that I guess this is our equivalent of a pre-war party

04:19:00.060 --> 04:19:05.100
You get clams land. This is there. We do a good luck. Bye. Oh take it

04:19:06.420 --> 04:19:10.660
This is our pre-war celebration. Okay, are you guys ready to carry me?

04:19:11.460 --> 04:19:14.660
I don't even know if there's a point of me eating the crab leg

04:19:16.180 --> 04:19:19.900
Oh, did you say thank you? I think you did. Okay, let's get busy

04:19:20.660 --> 04:19:26.480
I'm gonna let you guys do it again about slams worth even if we can carry it. Don't worry if I perish. I

04:19:27.060 --> 04:19:29.060
suck

04:19:29.060 --> 04:19:31.060
I can't destroy these

04:19:31.220 --> 04:19:35.300
Okay, let's commentate over the reeflings. I'm just gonna crouch in the corner

04:19:36.260 --> 04:19:40.900
Reefling goes in for a quick slam. We see some magical effects going into play

04:19:42.420 --> 04:19:47.580
We we've got rain on blood taking out almost half of the health of the reefling. Oh

04:19:48.580 --> 04:19:54.900
Three-fourths of the reefling help. He does heal up successfully recovering almost 50% of that HP up to 75%

04:19:55.460 --> 04:19:57.460
for his full max HP capacity

04:19:57.780 --> 04:20:03.500
We get a swing. We're now down to 50. We're back up to full health almost just a few

04:20:05.540 --> 04:20:10.660
We're going in for hits. We're doing melee against the enemy. The enemy's name I've forgotten

04:20:12.980 --> 04:20:14.980
The blood caster guy

04:20:15.780 --> 04:20:23.220
We do have our poor reefling getting picked on taking all the HP damage second reefling comes in for the clutch to take

04:20:23.300 --> 04:20:25.300
The aggro off of the boss

04:20:26.020 --> 04:20:31.140
Possibly to allow some heals. We do have rain on blood effect on screen

04:20:31.380 --> 04:20:39.700
Okay, we're now 50% on our second reefling in command. However, we do seem to have some sort of blood steal effect possibly

04:20:40.180 --> 04:20:42.180
for health restoration

04:20:42.740 --> 04:20:44.740
Hopefully we do have

04:20:46.340 --> 04:20:48.340
Oh, we're getting picked on

04:20:48.820 --> 04:20:54.980
Commentator comes in to take the aggro off of the reeflings. She runs away again and sheer panic and scaredness

04:20:55.380 --> 04:20:57.380
Oh, I need to stand up to get a faster run

04:20:58.180 --> 04:21:04.740
Okay commentator does come in for a swing to take the the aggro off of the reeflings very aggressive aggro on the reeflings

04:21:05.860 --> 04:21:07.860
Okay, this is why I can't get involved. I'm sorry

04:21:09.780 --> 04:21:15.700
Commentator does heal up. We've got a moon attack from Rena herself the moon lordness

04:21:17.700 --> 04:21:22.740
We do have a countdown on the blood attack. We've got three rings around us

04:21:24.420 --> 04:21:26.420
Get ready to heal

04:21:27.540 --> 04:21:29.540
I don't think I have enough

04:21:38.820 --> 04:21:43.780
Do we need to go get more flasks for me or a sacred tear possibly

04:21:45.700 --> 04:21:50.740
Oh, you guys are so close Ronnie needs a quick tour for the stuff. She can't be handled like the flask

04:21:50.980 --> 04:21:54.020
I think we might need to do flask tears

04:21:54.740 --> 04:22:01.300
Nah, just don't get hit. Okay. Okay. I will fully stand back and watch you guys get annihilated

04:22:02.020 --> 04:22:08.660
Okay, I'm gonna fully stand back. All my motherly instinct is being paused on hold because I don't want you guys to get hurt

04:22:09.460 --> 04:22:11.460
It let punish boost

04:22:15.460 --> 04:22:19.780
Uh, what wait, is that that actor who's seen me?

04:22:19.780 --> 04:22:21.780
Who's seen me

04:22:22.180 --> 04:22:24.180
Have we got

04:22:26.580 --> 04:22:30.020
You've not done a boss fight yet. I do have a separate boss list, okay

04:22:30.820 --> 04:22:35.540
Nah, do healer to sit on her. It's all when he does his siphon

04:22:36.420 --> 04:22:40.980
NIHIL can be avoided using a specific visit

04:22:41.620 --> 04:22:46.020
I don't have it. Wait, are you president nixon on and all it can be honest

04:22:46.100 --> 04:22:48.100
Be honest

04:22:49.300 --> 04:22:54.900
Crouch if you're president nixon be honest, you know, no, well, well, no, you're just doing that because I did that

04:22:55.700 --> 04:23:02.900
Uh, are we doing the pre-retual of the clam slam or what's you want pre-retual clam slam or are you guys ready to go for the fight?

04:23:03.540 --> 04:23:08.500
It's up to you as refland you can pick. Oh, is that cowering for the slam? Do you not have lie down?

04:23:09.060 --> 04:23:11.060
Oh, it does make you lie down. Okay

04:23:11.620 --> 04:23:13.620
Clam slam

04:23:16.980 --> 04:23:19.460
Boom. Do you have clam slam? Do you want clam slam time?

04:23:20.660 --> 04:23:24.020
No clam slam for you. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're covered take it off

04:23:24.980 --> 04:23:29.300
Let's go. Okay. We're ready for battle. We have done our pre battle battling

04:23:31.300 --> 04:23:34.500
You do not need to visit. Holy shit. Is that male gear reference?

04:23:36.260 --> 04:23:40.900
Okay, ready steady. I'm gonna commentate again

04:23:41.060 --> 04:23:43.060
And

04:23:43.620 --> 04:23:46.820
The two reflinks enter the battle dome

04:23:47.700 --> 04:23:52.980
To defeat the boss something we have none other than the famous actor

04:23:53.700 --> 04:24:00.180
Bersy me and Kagoro hits with the fucking moonbeam for over

04:24:01.460 --> 04:24:03.140
Whoa

For over half damage 50% on lord of blood mog already. We are mogging him off

04:24:10.980 --> 04:24:17.220
These two reflinks complementing each other one for magic on the debuffs the second for the meleys

04:24:17.620 --> 04:24:19.940
Hit him down to almost

04:24:20.740 --> 04:24:22.740
one four

04:24:22.740 --> 04:24:24.740
Prepare yourselves reflings

04:24:26.100 --> 04:24:29.700
Prepare for heels reflings prepare for heels

04:24:31.220 --> 04:24:35.940
Prepare for heels the heels have been prepared the guards have been rang

04:24:36.420 --> 04:24:42.740
I am out of freaking heels. So I hope he doesn't do that again. Uh, or I'm in trouble even though I'm not even fighting

04:24:44.340 --> 04:24:48.260
Okay, he's got his wings out. He's in his second phase. I assume

04:24:49.380 --> 04:24:51.860
We've got a few more moon attacks from Ranny

04:24:52.900 --> 04:24:55.780
Magic refling did go down a wee bit

04:24:56.660 --> 04:25:02.500
But he's okay. Melee refling going in for some of the kill. Unfortunately does get hit a little bit on the side

04:25:03.380 --> 04:25:08.980
Uh, oh melee refling getting cornered not good for the aggro has been taken by magic refling

04:25:10.820 --> 04:25:15.780
But uh magic refling now taking the aggro meleys getting in position again

04:25:17.620 --> 04:25:21.220
Melee refling is down. I repeat melee refling is down

04:25:21.860 --> 04:25:27.300
Magic refling his own one hp. I want to interfere. I want to interfere. I must interfere

04:25:27.700 --> 04:25:34.580
Magic refling probabilities. I'm a heels and cannot do anything. Oh shits on me. I surely I can do it. Surely I have to get enough

04:25:35.300 --> 04:25:37.300
Now he's like walking away

04:25:41.220 --> 04:25:44.820
He's like slowly walking away out of my tank

04:25:46.180 --> 04:25:49.780
Grab your runes. It's okay. It's okay. We have plenty

04:25:51.460 --> 04:25:57.140
It's okay. Literally he slowly walked to the side and I couldn't help

04:25:58.260 --> 04:26:01.780
I'm nothing but air. Look how long my sword is

04:26:02.660 --> 04:26:06.820
I'm gonna go get a quick can of cola. Okay reflings. I'll be just a millisecond

04:26:28.260 --> 04:26:30.660
This is my little foot feeling dry

04:26:31.780 --> 04:26:35.300
Okay refling. Let's see who's ready to take the test

04:26:35.940 --> 04:26:40.100
You have not gone against the ultimate enemy and you come

04:26:41.220 --> 04:26:42.340
Uh

04:26:42.340 --> 04:26:50.340
Slade you did actually take a whack at him. Just a fella has not taken a whack at our beloved god lord of blood

04:26:51.380 --> 04:26:53.380
You have not taken a whack at him

04:26:54.100 --> 04:26:55.700
Okay

04:26:55.700 --> 04:26:59.700
I like it mog is mid difficulty people just have reduced damage

04:27:00.020 --> 04:27:04.900
Yes, if you didn't know when you joined me as a refling as an aide if you will

04:27:05.460 --> 04:27:13.140
Um, your stats are reduced and so is your damage because it's so you don't make me the game too easy for me

04:27:14.820 --> 04:27:18.260
Oh, are we doing clam slam ritual? Okay. Okay. Let's get it out. Let's get it out

04:27:18.820 --> 04:27:22.900
Actually, I could probably just keep the sword out. Do you both want to line up before we do two and one?

04:27:23.540 --> 04:27:25.540
Or do you want separate you're allowed to get separate?

04:27:28.420 --> 04:27:30.420
I'll see you have the pose

04:27:33.220 --> 04:27:36.100
Okay pre ritual done. Let me get my weapon tree out

04:27:37.780 --> 04:27:43.620
Okay, ladies and gentlemen can our reflings do it. We appear to have two

04:27:44.260 --> 04:27:51.060
Maly reflings ready to take on mog the lord of blood as they both enter the arena

04:27:51.380 --> 04:27:58.980
Using stamina to get closer. Who's going to take the aggro first? Oh, we've got oh, we have a magical sway

04:28:00.180 --> 04:28:01.860
looks can be

04:28:01.860 --> 04:28:03.860
this evening because

04:28:04.420 --> 04:28:06.020
I were mainly

04:28:06.020 --> 04:28:12.260
Refling as no one said I can't join in for this because I beat him for dlc yesterday

04:28:12.260 --> 04:28:14.660
And I killed him before he could do his meal

04:28:15.380 --> 04:28:16.580
Neat

04:28:16.580 --> 04:28:19.540
Thank you so much for the five. Oh, we're gone

04:28:20.580 --> 04:28:22.980
Yes, unfortunately, it is pc only both

04:28:23.700 --> 04:28:25.220
melee

04:28:25.220 --> 04:28:30.740
Very close combat. Oh, it's magical melee. That's it. This refling's participating in

04:28:31.300 --> 04:28:34.020
If I can see correctly from the corner of my eye

04:28:35.540 --> 04:28:37.540
We do oh, okay

04:28:37.940 --> 04:28:41.700
Stone male stone refling is getting a little bit hit, but that's okay

04:28:42.100 --> 04:28:46.340
His shield is helping him armored out the wazoo we hope

04:28:46.900 --> 04:28:54.500
We are already on 60 health on more the lord of blood. These reflings are definitely making a

04:28:55.140 --> 04:28:57.140
short work of this lord

04:28:57.940 --> 04:28:59.460
maybe

04:28:59.460 --> 04:29:06.500
Short range melee is the way, but we do have a physics level up there if I if I'm not a physics class usage

04:29:07.460 --> 04:29:11.460
It prepared to heal prepared to heal you can do it

04:29:19.220 --> 04:29:23.140
Okay, we do have a moon room moon long uh being used

04:29:24.980 --> 04:29:27.860
We're looking good. We're both all of us are high health

04:29:27.940 --> 04:29:35.620
Oh, we took out a beating on his health bar 17 took a bit of tick damage as we're for 44 is able to heal up

04:29:36.180 --> 04:29:39.700
But worry not he is going straight back into the fight again

04:29:39.700 --> 04:29:43.700
I am actually out of range for the second refling that is how far back I am hiding

04:29:44.500 --> 04:29:46.500
They are fighting him at the stairs

04:29:47.780 --> 04:29:56.180
Thai lord receiving over 90 percent damage. Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay. We are able to heal. We might be at max heals

04:29:56.740 --> 04:29:58.740
We're not sure

04:29:59.540 --> 04:30:01.300
Oh dear

04:30:01.300 --> 04:30:03.300
Oh dear

04:30:03.780 --> 04:30:06.740
Oh dear, is it all falling apart me friends?

04:30:07.860 --> 04:30:09.860
Doesn't matter

04:30:12.020 --> 04:30:17.860
I don't have heels. I don't have heels. I don't have heels. He's he tricked me. He tricked me

04:30:18.420 --> 04:30:23.220
I don't have heels. I don't have any more heels. He tricked me. I'm empty

04:30:24.180 --> 04:30:28.900
He freaking came for me. Okay. I'm hiding up at the egg. Don't bring him to the egg. Okay

04:30:29.620 --> 04:30:31.620
Stay down there

04:30:31.780 --> 04:30:33.780
Stay down here

04:30:34.180 --> 04:30:37.940
Oh, no, Thai lord is kind of low. I think he's out of heels

04:30:38.260 --> 04:30:43.780
One refling is there and it's now rests on the shoulders of melee magic refling

04:30:44.020 --> 04:30:48.500
Where it looks can be this evening. He takes 50 percent damage from the boss

04:30:49.780 --> 04:30:56.820
He does manage to heal up. Oh, but he takes another 60 percent damage of phil health bar. It rains blood and it captures

04:30:56.820 --> 04:30:58.820
No

04:30:59.460 --> 04:31:05.780
I can do it. I can do it. I'm so brave. I'm so brave and magical

04:31:06.900 --> 04:31:08.900
I am not afraid

04:31:09.780 --> 04:31:15.700
I know the boss's mechanics. I do not he's gonna do it. It's like, okay. I'm not even getting a bit

04:31:16.100 --> 04:31:21.060
I'm burning alive. I literally I'm not gonna get okay. I got a hit. I got 127 damage

04:31:22.740 --> 04:31:24.740
127 damage

04:31:24.980 --> 04:31:26.020
Yay

04:31:26.020 --> 04:31:28.020
I tried my best

04:31:28.020 --> 04:31:31.780
I have absolutely no idea what his freaking hit registration is or anything

04:31:33.380 --> 04:31:37.620
I tried to scarlet rot cheese but it didn't do enough. Don't worry. Don't worry. We're gonna keep at it

04:31:38.180 --> 04:31:41.060
I'll give it a couple of more attempts and if it really is too much

04:31:41.220 --> 04:31:47.300
What we'll do is get some flasks for me and some golden seat because we are kind of skipping

04:31:47.700 --> 04:31:51.300
Salad you did have you had a shot at this?

04:31:51.940 --> 04:31:57.060
Weeb hasn't had a shot at this. Sorry. I'm like literally just renaming you guys

04:31:58.100 --> 04:32:00.100
Uh, do I recognize

04:32:02.100 --> 04:32:05.300
You have two you have a clobber and a long

04:32:07.620 --> 04:32:11.860
Why won't it let me interact with your sign and won't let me interact with you

04:32:12.820 --> 04:32:20.500
I'm teabagging you. It's not doing anything. I have buckham salad. I'm so sorry. My brain registers you as salad

04:32:20.500 --> 04:32:27.700
Also smithing so and strong his weapon needs upgraded should be hitting way more than a hundred. Okay

04:32:28.260 --> 04:32:35.300
Okay, we're gonna clap mogs cheeks and then we'll maybe do a bit of cheeky. Wow. I cannot interact with anyone right now

04:32:38.020 --> 04:32:40.020
Weep weep your internet is

04:32:40.660 --> 04:32:44.260
Is having a hard time connecting. I think you're about to time out not gonna lie

04:32:44.500 --> 04:32:50.900
All right, hold on everyone take a sip of water, please or a sip of some sort of liquid. Oh, no, you couldn't connect

04:32:52.340 --> 04:32:55.220
Right, who was it? Oh, no, you've moved wait

04:32:57.140 --> 04:32:59.140
Drag you've not had a wallet

04:32:59.700 --> 04:33:01.700
At this king at this king at the sword

04:33:02.660 --> 04:33:04.660
Can you come in?

04:33:04.900 --> 04:33:06.900
Good everyone's like not coming in

04:33:07.940 --> 04:33:09.940
Have you had a work at the boss?

04:33:10.500 --> 04:33:14.740
You haven't you actually haven't had a work at the boss

04:33:16.180 --> 04:33:20.900
Okay, our two reeflings have got they've been decided. We've got some sort of long

04:33:21.700 --> 04:33:23.700
two-handed spear

04:33:24.100 --> 04:33:26.820
Hi, are you ready to kill the boss?

04:33:28.740 --> 04:33:30.740
Oh, thank you

04:33:31.300 --> 04:33:36.660
Little reeflings risen me. Oh, he's giving me compliments before I take his boy cherry

04:33:37.380 --> 04:33:42.580
Are you are you okay? Are you ready for me to take your boy cherry?

04:33:45.060 --> 04:33:48.740
There we go already for war. That's what we like to see

04:33:49.780 --> 04:33:52.900
Ready for battle. So we have uh melee

04:33:54.340 --> 04:33:59.220
Let's get to it. This reeflings ready to go. He does not care. He does not care about the well

04:33:59.220 --> 04:34:01.220
He does care because he did get pre-ritual

04:34:01.780 --> 04:34:05.620
We do appear to have two melee reeflings again, which is perfectly fine

04:34:05.620 --> 04:34:11.140
We're gonna see how they complement one another and their strategies against none other than the lord of blood

04:34:11.220 --> 04:34:13.460
I'm gonna hydrate because keep saying I'm gonna hydrate and then I don't

04:34:15.540 --> 04:34:17.540
Okay, here we go

04:34:19.860 --> 04:34:26.180
Okay a bit rusty a bit rusty we have received a 30 percent health damage on one reefling a bit rusty stone reefling

04:34:26.180 --> 04:34:27.940
Let's see because you got stone shield

04:34:27.940 --> 04:34:33.780
Oh, we have a bit of sorcery a bit of sorcery looks can be this evening

04:34:35.060 --> 04:34:40.260
Again magic being used not fill melee classes. Perhaps mistaken

04:34:41.700 --> 04:34:45.300
Perhaps mistaken again close range reeflings

04:34:46.580 --> 04:34:50.340
Taking on one another. We do have a 50 percent hit on drake

04:34:51.060 --> 04:34:55.300
But we don't want him going down. He does have a physics class get active. I'm not sure what the boon

04:34:55.860 --> 04:35:00.820
The bonus is but he does have it active because he looks like a little bubble right now. Oh, no

04:35:01.780 --> 04:35:03.780
Ambron goes down to

04:35:03.860 --> 04:35:07.940
10% does manage to heal up with two health flasks. However

04:35:09.460 --> 04:35:15.140
Unaware we will need to prepare for healing at the blood loss section

04:35:17.700 --> 04:35:23.220
We'll need to prepare oh again lower than 50% on our

04:35:24.180 --> 04:35:26.180
On that

04:35:26.180 --> 04:35:29.540
Oh, you're a stone reefling. I got I got a few years. I got a mess up

04:35:31.140 --> 04:35:33.140
Maybe we need a magic in it

04:35:35.140 --> 04:35:37.140
We're gonna do this

04:35:37.140 --> 04:35:42.420
We're getting a few wax in here in there. We're doing tick damage. We've got 2000 4000

04:35:43.140 --> 04:35:45.140
5.4

04:35:46.100 --> 04:35:50.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa reeflings working overtime with their magic

04:35:50.260 --> 04:35:52.900
Do you love reeflings don't die on me now?

04:35:55.060 --> 04:35:57.860
Okay, we did manage to avoid the annihilation

04:35:58.580 --> 04:36:00.420
attack

04:36:00.420 --> 04:36:07.380
We are back to 50 health on the main boss. We are getting a few tallywax in but we are taking tick damage from the

04:36:07.780 --> 04:36:08.900
floor

04:36:08.900 --> 04:36:15.780
We are at 20 on one reefling. He does manage to dodge until he gets taken. It is now up to drake

04:36:16.340 --> 04:36:22.100
Can he one man this boss is the question we do not know

04:36:22.980 --> 04:36:26.180
How many restorative potions there may be

04:36:28.180 --> 04:36:30.180
We are doing

04:36:32.500 --> 04:36:38.980
Don't worry reeflings. I'll come in clutch. I'll come in clutch. I'm surely I'll come in clutch

04:36:39.300 --> 04:36:41.300
Wow

04:36:41.860 --> 04:36:46.340
199 damage. That's the most damage I've done against some. Yay

04:36:47.780 --> 04:36:51.380
I beat my record. My damage is the 350

04:36:51.940 --> 04:36:55.300
nine damage total against the boss. Let's go

04:36:58.420 --> 04:37:01.140
In strontis army no reefling dies a virgin

04:37:03.060 --> 04:37:07.860
Honestly, I mean I can like I'll take one for the team

04:37:07.940 --> 04:37:10.740
Is it even taken one for the team if everyone enjoys it?

04:37:12.100 --> 04:37:18.020
Hmm, can't send you off on your own like that. Uh gaav is not taking a cheeky stab

04:37:19.620 --> 04:37:21.620
At this boss

04:37:22.260 --> 04:37:24.260
Uh and who else? Uh

04:37:26.820 --> 04:37:32.340
Sean has not taken a stab at this boss. My boss list is getting very full

04:37:32.340 --> 04:37:34.340
I don't know

04:37:35.860 --> 04:37:39.700
Look we got it. Oh, we've got a blood build samurai blood build

04:37:40.660 --> 04:37:46.900
Oh, we're doing the pre ritual of coming of I cannot send a reefling into war without uh, no weapon leveling

04:37:47.140 --> 04:37:49.140

04:38:13.300 --> 04:38:14.820
Ariya's

04:38:14.820 --> 04:38:16.820
What is this?

04:38:17.060 --> 04:38:22.580
You're gonna beat them up with your gloves. I don't think I've ever seen gloves used before

04:38:23.540 --> 04:38:24.980
Okay

04:38:24.980 --> 04:38:27.140
Okay, let's see what happens reeflin

We do have magical boxing gloves in play. Um, not sure how that's gonna go

04:38:39.940 --> 04:38:46.580
We are both melee again close combat with the reeflings. We do have a physics class active on gaav reeflings

04:38:46.980 --> 04:38:53.460
Oh, no, we have two both of them have physics activated. We're down to 50 health on a big old swing

04:38:53.620 --> 04:38:58.580
We are full health again. Thankfully, uh commentator is gonna run to the egg. So don't worry

04:38:59.140 --> 04:39:03.380
Don't worry commentator is running to the egg. I repeat commentator to the egg

04:39:04.900 --> 04:39:07.060
Okay, we are getting walloped a bit

04:39:07.220 --> 04:39:10.260
We are getting very close gaav is cutting it close with the health

04:39:10.260 --> 04:39:14.180
But art is able to restore health overall. Do you need to make sure we have physics?

04:39:14.900 --> 04:39:22.100
health flasks in preparation for our uno dose trace blood n i l i h annihilation

04:39:23.460 --> 04:39:25.460
On the second we do need to prepare

04:39:26.500 --> 04:39:28.500
But the reeflings are getting some swings in

04:39:29.460 --> 04:39:35.940
The damage is down to 60 on the boss health. I think a little hydration

04:39:38.500 --> 04:39:40.500
We do have a dose

04:39:41.140 --> 04:39:48.580
We are mailing it the out the wazoo. Oh, we are getting pummeled though, but we do we do seem to heal

04:39:50.180 --> 04:39:52.180
We're making it rain blood

04:39:52.420 --> 04:39:56.660
Um, but it is not ketchup season for this streamer

04:39:58.580 --> 04:40:04.980
We do have full health on both reeflings. They are taking tick damage. Okay. Here we go. Here we go. Get ready

04:40:06.580 --> 04:40:08.820
Oh wait, we have three rings. Is that the one he does it?

04:40:09.620 --> 04:40:14.820
Okay. Okay. We're ready. We're prepared. We know how to drink. We're good boys and girls out here

04:40:14.820 --> 04:40:20.580
We know how to drink drink drink drink chug chug chug, but don't get steaming because I don't think it's a weekend yet

04:40:20.820 --> 04:40:26.500
We we are full health for both reeflings. We are in phase two with full health

04:40:26.660 --> 04:40:32.020
Scab does take a cheeky 50. However, can recover possibly unless out of flasks

04:40:32.340 --> 04:40:37.220
Yeah, wow, both reeflings melee second phase full damage physics up

04:40:37.940 --> 04:40:45.220
Hold on. Is this the run is? Oh, I spoke too soon. I spoke too soon. No, don't leave me with a boss

04:40:46.180 --> 04:40:48.180
Don't leave me with a boss

04:40:48.420 --> 04:40:53.140
We are down a reef like oh, we're down a second reef like

04:40:53.860 --> 04:40:59.300
No, okay. It's okay. It's okay. Right. He's gonna do one big old thrust at me

04:41:00.260 --> 04:41:04.740
Or well, I'm not gonna be able to do it. But it's fine. It's fine

04:41:05.380 --> 04:41:09.700
So, can you know scarlet brought cheese this man cheat reeflings cheese man right now?

04:41:10.420 --> 04:41:15.300
Oh, I hit for 407. I hit for 500. Let's go

04:41:15.940 --> 04:41:20.180
I'll take it. I'll take it. That was a new record. That was like 600 plus

04:41:20.980 --> 04:41:23.540
Oh my god, I have a new high score against him

04:41:24.980 --> 04:41:28.820
You cursed it. You cursed it. Okay. I won't I won't say anything then I made just

04:41:29.540 --> 04:41:32.740
Uh, you can scarlet wrote cheese him. I just did it badly. Oh

04:41:33.620 --> 04:41:35.700
That's okay. We have a few more attempts. Do we know?

04:41:37.860 --> 04:41:41.460
I process like three frostbites. Yeah

04:41:41.940 --> 04:41:43.780
It's 20. It's sundae

04:41:43.780 --> 04:41:48.100
Wait, are you allowed to get junk on sundae if you have work on monday? I thought friday

04:41:48.820 --> 04:41:52.900
Um, we have aqua the wise and you come we have a mage

04:41:54.180 --> 04:41:56.180
Interesting interesting interesting

04:41:58.020 --> 04:42:03.140
Um, and then we have throngler. Have you had a chance at this lovely boss?

04:42:03.140 --> 04:42:06.660
You have not had a chance at the boss boss yet and you come for rongler

04:42:06.660 --> 04:42:13.220
We have a clear we have jewel wield mage runny

04:42:14.580 --> 04:42:20.580
And oh, we've got a little pirouette. Oh nice to meet you. How elegant are you?

04:42:22.660 --> 04:42:25.060
And then we have second refling that's loading in right now

04:42:26.020 --> 04:42:28.180
Oh, we have even a polite little bow

04:42:28.980 --> 04:42:34.660
And then we have throngler the jewel wield melee. Okay. We're gonna see how magic and melee complement each other

04:42:34.900 --> 04:42:39.380
Oh, you don't need to pray to me. I assure you I will bless you with everything you need in a second

04:42:47.700 --> 04:42:54.900
Okay, let's see if our reflings can complement one another with two different strategies one with magic

04:42:55.300 --> 04:43:01.700
One with jewel wield melee. Let's see how it goes. I've got 13 minutes left of saturday. That'll do that'll do

04:43:02.420 --> 04:43:04.420
Okay

04:43:04.660 --> 04:43:08.500
Reflings have entered the battle dome magic is taking

04:43:09.460 --> 04:43:14.020
Some elements. We're doing the moon beam runny approach

04:43:14.900 --> 04:43:16.900
melee

04:43:17.140 --> 04:43:23.620
Oh, we are getting sprayed down for a nasty hit. We are locked on to mage until melee refling takes

04:43:24.500 --> 04:43:26.340
The aggro sort

04:43:26.340 --> 04:43:28.020
I'm gonna move to the egg

04:43:28.020 --> 04:43:31.220
But just keep fighting you guys are doing great. Just keep it up speed. You're doing great

04:43:32.420 --> 04:43:34.420
Uh, we do have

04:43:34.500 --> 04:43:38.100
Okay, okay. Well, there's not gonna give me anything is it? No, I didn't have anything. Okay

04:43:39.300 --> 04:43:42.420
We do have are they complementing each other?

04:43:42.740 --> 04:43:46.020
Can the melee refling keep aggro so the mage

04:43:46.580 --> 04:43:52.100
Refling can keep it up and just keep blasting and doing that tick damage is the question

04:43:52.420 --> 04:43:57.220
We are on the second ring of the aoe n i l m n o p attack

04:43:57.940 --> 04:43:59.780
um

04:43:59.780 --> 04:44:04.740
So we do have to mentally prepare for what comes next. We are doing tick damage over time

04:44:04.820 --> 04:44:08.180
We are already close to 50 damage of the boss

04:44:09.300 --> 04:44:15.700
Is melee magic the way to complement one another? Reflings? We will find out that strategy live

04:44:16.260 --> 04:44:18.260
We do have a

04:44:21.460 --> 04:44:26.260
I may have just killed us, but don't worry. I may have just killed us

04:44:26.500 --> 04:44:29.700
I may have just killed us because I don't have enough class

04:44:31.300 --> 04:44:38.980
Okay, no, it's fine. It's fine. Oh our mage refling is down is up to melee refling that has all of the aggro at the moment

04:44:38.980 --> 04:44:46.020
He is debuffed because he is helping me in my game. He does take a dodge for the aoe

04:44:46.980 --> 04:44:51.220
Oh the area of effect of these flames that are left over is just

04:44:51.380 --> 04:44:59.140
Overwhelming the power the power of the lord of blood is a bit too much, but that's okay. We're trying our best

04:44:59.860 --> 04:45:01.860
Take it

04:45:02.340 --> 04:45:04.340
Okay, I'm out stamina. Well, I tried

04:45:06.180 --> 04:45:08.180
Completely out of stamina. There we go

04:45:11.060 --> 04:45:14.660
Okay, not bad not bad it was interesting

04:45:16.180 --> 04:45:20.500
This is gonna hurt very that was interesting. I think maybe

04:45:21.220 --> 04:45:27.140
A magic and a melee might be most complementary because if the melee takes the fill aggro

04:45:28.180 --> 04:45:31.780
In theory should I be doing magic right now?

04:45:33.060 --> 04:45:35.220
Oops, sorry wrong one. Okay, let's go again

04:45:41.060 --> 04:45:47.460
Okay, who have we got um, I don't recognize you Ezra income

04:45:49.140 --> 04:45:51.140
Ezra income

04:45:51.860 --> 04:45:54.820
And we did just how are you already in there?

04:45:55.780 --> 04:46:02.820
Uh thigh lord, we did have you have an attempt. I'm just gonna check. There's no one here that hasn't had an attempt yet

04:46:03.780 --> 04:46:05.780
a

04:46:06.260 --> 04:46:11.940
Rivers you've not had an attempt just far as that my eye can see no and you come

04:46:13.940 --> 04:46:16.180
Wait, yeah, no I haven't I haven't actually

04:46:17.140 --> 04:46:23.700
Hello, wait, we must do our pre ritual. Maybe I should just keep this out to be honest. Maybe I just keep it out

04:46:27.220 --> 04:46:33.940
Okay, are you ready get blessed get blessed get blessed and then now it's your turn for the blessing

04:46:36.020 --> 04:46:39.860
That's right. You better say you're getting blessed get blessed get blessed get blessed

04:46:41.300 --> 04:46:43.300
Okay pre-war ritual complete

04:46:43.940 --> 04:46:45.940
let's go

04:46:45.940 --> 04:46:49.060
I'll just leave I'll leave the sword on there's no way I'm finishing the boss off

04:46:49.860 --> 04:46:51.860
we appear to have

04:46:51.860 --> 04:46:53.620
a

04:46:53.620 --> 04:46:57.460
Shield and sword reefling and then a two-handed reefling

04:46:58.100 --> 04:47:01.140
No, we I see some magic stuff going on hold on

04:47:02.500 --> 04:47:07.700
Uh my small brain cannot comprehend that if you look like melee

04:47:08.740 --> 04:47:13.700
That they might have some magic spells up. Uh, there is a gray bar on the H

04:47:16.180 --> 04:47:21.300
Uh, there is a gray bar on the enemy already not sure what that means

04:47:21.700 --> 04:47:24.820
But is that going to stop the reeflings? Absolutely not

04:47:25.700 --> 04:47:27.700
Uh, we do have a pressure

04:47:28.100 --> 04:47:32.980
Downfall magic that holds an enemy in place momentarily

04:47:33.780 --> 04:47:39.300
Curious we are at 50 hell max hp reduction. Wow

04:47:40.980 --> 04:47:45.220
That must come at a pretty price a pretty price of mana indeed

04:47:46.900 --> 04:47:49.700
Well, the reeflings are going for it. We're raining blood

04:47:49.780 --> 04:47:54.180
But it's not enough to hurt the reeflings extra careful extra cautious

04:47:54.500 --> 04:48:00.660
Hardly any damage done to the reeflings at all and yet lord of blood is down on his luck

04:48:00.740 --> 04:48:03.940
He is below 50. He is doing now

04:48:04.660 --> 04:48:08.500
To try his best to get any smidgen back

04:48:09.060 --> 04:48:12.340
But he does not understand as just as

04:48:12.900 --> 04:48:19.060
Strongies stamina is unending. So is the reeflings for they have the fortitude

04:48:19.380 --> 04:48:21.940
They have the insight one reefling does go down

04:48:22.660 --> 04:48:25.700
We are remaining on our two-handed reefling

04:48:26.740 --> 04:48:27.940
shit

04:48:27.940 --> 04:48:29.140
Not good

04:48:29.140 --> 04:48:31.140
Maybe joining the fight

04:48:31.780 --> 04:48:33.780
I can't i'm out of hp

04:48:34.260 --> 04:48:40.580
Can it's on your reeflings. He does get a few blood strikes in the enemy is very low. I'm tempted

04:48:41.140 --> 04:48:47.060
I'm very tempted to swap to the the second grace or just in case all I have to do all I have to do is the tiddly wing

04:48:47.380 --> 04:48:50.020
Don't fuck it up. Just a tiddly wing

04:48:51.460 --> 04:48:56.740
Just a tiddly wing just a tiddly wing just a tiddly wing come here come here right now

04:48:56.980 --> 04:49:02.580
It's I literally have to tickle his ballsack. Please. Please. Please. Let me just run and jump

04:49:03.380 --> 04:49:08.740
Please the reeflings the reeflings have turned so hard. Please. Please. Please

04:49:09.060 --> 04:49:11.060
Oh

04:49:11.300 --> 04:49:17.060
Please. Please. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. She throws

04:49:23.380 --> 04:49:26.420
She throws one hp

04:49:27.780 --> 04:49:29.780
One hp

04:49:30.340 --> 04:49:32.340
One hp she throws

04:49:33.540 --> 04:49:35.540
Oh my god

04:49:36.020 --> 04:49:42.660
Oh my god, what what a duel those two reeflings were truly complemented one another

04:49:44.020 --> 04:49:51.780
Uh, if we've not had you coming into the boss reeflings outstanding effort. I'm just going to check uh high

04:49:53.140 --> 04:49:55.620
Pre-stess you have not had a whack at the boss

04:49:56.660 --> 04:49:59.300
He uh, if an high pre-stess and you come

04:50:00.260 --> 04:50:05.620
Fantastic effort. It was a tiddly wing. I do apologize for messing that up

04:50:06.020 --> 04:50:11.460
But at the end of the day, we're here for a fantastic time. That was very well played

04:50:11.780 --> 04:50:18.660
All reeflings very well played against this boss just as a reminder when someone comes into your world to help you out

04:50:19.220 --> 04:50:22.980
One little ceremony done. What about your ceremony? Hmm?

04:50:24.020 --> 04:50:28.500
Did you think I forgot to ceremony you do you not have lie down? You don't want it?

04:50:30.100 --> 04:50:33.060
I'm afraid it's not optional. You will take what you get

04:50:35.620 --> 04:50:37.620
You have been ceremony eyes

04:50:39.380 --> 04:50:44.580
Uh, yes, all reeflings are helping. Please don't ever feel bad if you mess up or have a little mistake

04:50:45.220 --> 04:50:48.020
You should use a blessing to get your hp back

04:50:49.060 --> 04:50:51.060
Maybe maybe I should

04:50:52.020 --> 04:50:57.940
Now let's see we have a magic sword and play by another and high pre-stess which makes exact sense

04:50:58.020 --> 04:51:02.740
Considering the name oof is going for the close combat already picks up the aggro from

04:51:03.460 --> 04:51:04.820
Mog

04:51:04.820 --> 04:51:08.900
But are is this reefling joe enough to mug mug himself?

04:51:09.780 --> 04:51:14.820
We are taking some serious magic damage on one of the builds of the reeflings

04:51:16.420 --> 04:51:17.780
Oh

04:51:17.780 --> 04:51:23.620
Riffling already down. Uh, it appears oof is timing out question mark

04:51:24.580 --> 04:51:30.580
Uh, reeflings connection has timed out

04:51:31.540 --> 04:51:33.540
Um

04:51:33.940 --> 04:51:35.940
Uh, sure

04:51:36.100 --> 04:51:42.500
Sure, why not? Sure. Why not? Okay. We tried our best with what we had in church. It's fine

04:51:44.100 --> 04:51:46.100
It's fine. We tried what we could

04:51:47.060 --> 04:51:50.020
It's joining after nil you can use the blessing

04:51:56.260 --> 04:52:02.580
Okay, maybe one of the weakest attempts, but it was an attempt nonetheless as long as you get up and keep trying

04:52:02.900 --> 04:52:06.020
What's how does that song go you get knocked down?

04:52:06.340 --> 04:52:08.340
But I get up again

04:52:09.220 --> 04:52:12.260
The per DC let's just like is that reeflings standing on the floor?

04:52:12.820 --> 04:52:15.780
Uh, we do have someone called okay, and you come okay

04:52:17.060 --> 04:52:18.900
We haven't had okay

04:52:18.900 --> 04:52:20.900
Who have we got?

04:52:21.140 --> 04:52:23.860
I think you're patiently waiting to see if there's no one new

04:52:24.580 --> 04:52:25.860
You

04:52:25.860 --> 04:52:27.860
We've got a joe weild on the hip

04:52:28.420 --> 04:52:30.420
No, we've got joe weild in the hands

04:52:32.020 --> 04:52:34.420
HMRC make sure you pay your taxes

04:52:34.500 --> 04:52:41.700
Please hold back 30 of your income to pay taxes to any at any point and please remember to reclaim

04:52:42.660 --> 04:52:45.620
Um anything you can on your taxes do not be embarrassed

04:52:46.180 --> 04:52:50.020
Reminder that billionaire companies do not pay a single penny of tax while you

04:52:50.820 --> 04:52:51.940
do

04:52:51.940 --> 04:52:58.260
So please do not ever feel bad if you want to claim for example if you are a car mechanic you can

04:52:59.140 --> 04:53:04.260
Claim back washing up liquid on your clothes because you need to be presentable for work

04:53:04.820 --> 04:53:10.820
As long as you can justify the cost of your daily living me. Uh, are you guys not lying down? Hello?

04:53:11.700 --> 04:53:14.660
If you don't lie down, I'll make sure it's our word, okay?

04:53:15.620 --> 04:53:17.620
Yeah, that's what I thought you better put. Yeah

04:53:21.940 --> 04:53:23.940
Right you your next

04:53:27.220 --> 04:53:29.220
I fit you just fine

04:53:29.220 --> 04:53:34.500
Yeah, I have to admit it's going to start whistling at the rate. I'm uh doing these rituals, but we're trying our best

04:53:35.220 --> 04:53:37.780
Right. Are you ready reeflings? You have been

04:53:38.820 --> 04:53:40.820
What am I looking? Oh, okay. Sorry

04:53:41.540 --> 04:53:44.340
Right, we have a bleed

04:53:44.900 --> 04:53:48.900
It looks like a bleed build on one reefling and it appears to be

04:53:49.460 --> 04:53:52.580
Okay, we're chugging a lot of flasks. We do have a

04:53:53.780 --> 04:53:58.900
Something going on. I don't this is a lot of stuff going on with that reefland. I have no idea what magic is filling

04:54:00.180 --> 04:54:02.180
A bit strong that's so unfair

04:54:04.740 --> 04:54:08.020
Come on reeflings show mommy what you're worth

04:54:08.980 --> 04:54:14.500
Nah, you you're worth isn't based on the price to be a boss for me in a video game. Please don't worry

04:54:18.020 --> 04:54:20.020
Wow

04:54:20.340 --> 04:54:22.340
Okay

04:54:22.900 --> 04:54:27.300
Okay, sorry my throat's getting a bit sore and I'm like, I need to try and

04:54:28.180 --> 04:54:35.140
Say um, okay raining down on blood. We do have a meaty swack of 50% on hmrc to pay your taxes

04:54:35.860 --> 04:54:37.860
Uh, okay standing

04:54:38.340 --> 04:54:41.060
No close close combat melee again

04:54:42.100 --> 04:54:44.820
Hmc struggling with the dodgers a little bit

04:54:45.220 --> 04:54:51.780
Okay gets caught up in an attack that wasn't even targeted on him. Hmc is backing off

04:54:52.260 --> 04:54:54.260
He's trying his best

04:54:55.060 --> 04:54:59.220
Uh, please don't worry about the enemy coming over to me. I do have the health to

04:54:59.780 --> 04:55:06.500
Not get whacked. We are low health. Are we out of healing is the question are we out of healing is the question

04:55:07.300 --> 04:55:11.780
For hmrc. I know you don't have an r in your name for hmc. You are down

04:55:13.780 --> 04:55:21.380
Single reefling called okay left up on the map. We are experiencing blood loss together, but that's okay

04:55:21.860 --> 04:55:23.860
What I pressed x

04:55:25.220 --> 04:55:28.980
I was pressing x sorry. I'm flopped at that

04:55:29.540 --> 04:55:35.780
I was pressing x you can literally hear my finger on the button. I have audio evidence of me hitting x

04:55:36.580 --> 04:55:37.700
brah

04:55:37.700 --> 04:55:38.500
brah

04:55:38.500 --> 04:55:40.500
That's just sabotage the reef looms

04:55:41.540 --> 04:55:44.260
Is that right outrageous my goodness, outrageous

04:55:47.620 --> 04:55:53.700
Wow, okay, uh country pumpkin you've not had to show pumpkin

04:55:55.140 --> 04:55:57.140
um

04:55:57.300 --> 04:55:59.300
Barrette

04:55:59.300 --> 04:56:06.580
Don't recognize you barrette. You've not been in either is country pumpkin and barrette gonna compliment each other

04:56:06.660 --> 04:56:09.860
Let's check out the build. We have heavy armor

04:56:10.580 --> 04:56:12.580
weaponry

04:56:12.660 --> 04:56:14.660
I don't know what these weapons are

04:56:16.420 --> 04:56:18.420
What are you doing?

04:56:18.900 --> 04:56:24.740
You get a parent you and uh, so this this pose is face-sitting if you want face-sitting. Okay

04:56:25.380 --> 04:56:26.740
Hi

04:56:26.740 --> 04:56:28.340
And you are

04:56:28.340 --> 04:56:34.020
Schematar joe wheel. So this is face-sitting if you kneel and if you go in the floor

04:56:34.660 --> 04:56:38.980
It's it's clam slam. And then if you want the butt, it's something else

04:56:39.060 --> 04:56:46.340
But I don't know what it is. You have both been blessed simultaneously due to the a massive circumference that my budget you provide

04:56:46.820 --> 04:56:49.220
Uh, we'll need to think of a pose if you want, uh,

04:56:49.860 --> 04:56:51.860
Veno

04:56:51.940 --> 04:56:55.540
Are the reeflings ready on your mark? I'm gonna see

04:56:56.340 --> 04:57:00.420
Another grip of heroes has fallen messed. Well for your watches in

04:57:04.820 --> 04:57:10.420
Okay, we're good. We're good. Well, we have magic coming out from country pumpkin did not actually

04:57:11.940 --> 04:57:13.140
um

04:57:13.140 --> 04:57:16.420
Both again trying to get nice and close for one another

04:57:17.460 --> 04:57:20.580
Uh having the agile constantly swapping

04:57:22.340 --> 04:57:30.180
Which might be a good thing to give one reefling a break from the other pumpkin does cast we have lower hp on the boss total

04:57:30.820 --> 04:57:34.500
Raining blood not quite getting it but rest down to 50 percent

04:57:34.500 --> 04:57:37.620
However, he is going to be able to get out of the area

04:57:38.020 --> 04:57:44.580
He is rolling around as if he was on fire. Remember folks at home to stop drop roll

04:57:45.860 --> 04:57:50.740
That's the best way to deal with your issues but rest taking on very close combat damage

04:57:51.620 --> 04:57:57.060
Does manage to heal up. We're gonna heal heal. I'm I'm spamming eggs. You can hear it spam

04:57:58.020 --> 04:58:01.780
Here it gets banned in the microphone. I have the controller right up. There we go. Feeling healed

04:58:02.420 --> 04:58:04.420
For the best I can do

04:58:04.820 --> 04:58:11.380
We are doing magic damage. Don't worry about bringing the boss over to me. I can't evade so don't panic

04:58:12.260 --> 04:58:15.300
It's very unlikely the boss will target me at any point

04:58:16.580 --> 04:58:18.580
Words spoken like a true

04:58:19.060 --> 04:58:21.060
Main character

04:58:21.060 --> 04:58:24.500
Pumpkin and bereft going in it again. We are on phase two

04:58:25.860 --> 04:58:30.180
We're looking quite strong face to his very aggressive very hard to

04:58:30.740 --> 04:58:34.020
Harry with the perfect timing of your attacks

04:58:34.980 --> 04:58:41.940
Most common dodges to roll into the enemies. However, due to his aoe fire left over

04:58:42.500 --> 04:58:44.500
This is almost like committing

04:58:44.820 --> 04:58:46.820
slower slide

04:58:47.060 --> 04:58:49.700
So to dodge this enemy it is not easy

04:58:49.780 --> 04:58:57.780
We are down to less than 20 health on the both bereft on the five percent taking tick damage from the aoe fire

04:58:58.180 --> 04:59:00.180
bereft seems to be out of potions

04:59:00.180 --> 04:59:03.780
He is giving it his all no health no health

04:59:04.340 --> 04:59:05.460
pumpkin

04:59:05.460 --> 04:59:12.820
Can he do it can pumpkin finish off the last less than 10 percent health of the lord

04:59:13.700 --> 04:59:15.700
of blood himself

04:59:16.660 --> 04:59:18.660
Pumpkin goes in for a big hit

04:59:19.460 --> 04:59:24.020
Does 500 just shy of 500 again doing some tick damage

04:59:24.340 --> 04:59:31.140
We are less than five percent boss health. Can country bumpkin make it happen less than one percent health?

04:59:32.980 --> 04:59:35.860
Yes, he did it fantastic

04:59:36.820 --> 04:59:41.460
Oh, he flicks it on them. He flicks it on the fantastic jewel

04:59:42.180 --> 04:59:46.420
The reth and pumpkin managed to do it together fantastic

04:59:47.460 --> 04:59:49.460
cooperation between the reeflings

04:59:49.860 --> 04:59:51.060

05:01:25.060 --> 05:01:27.060
Rain is under the weather question mark

05:01:28.260 --> 05:01:34.820
Question mark rain is under the weather. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Am I just making up lore for rain? That's not true

05:01:35.460 --> 05:01:39.540
Up next red Ann and oh Kaleid

Humbly apologize. Right. We now need to go to Kaleid

05:01:58.100 --> 05:02:01.860
So we actually need to go like all the way to the star

05:02:02.180 --> 05:02:06.020
Honestly take us to the church of ele

05:02:06.820 --> 05:02:08.820
Get the grease did I not get it?

05:02:08.980 --> 05:02:10.980
I didn't get it. Yeah, rest up

05:02:14.900 --> 05:02:19.540
Oh, wow, I can actually level up for once because of how big my leveling up is

05:02:21.620 --> 05:02:25.300
Uh, right strength is already 99 what would I put it in?

05:02:26.740 --> 05:02:31.060
Endurance just to level up my stamina and equipment load I guess

05:02:32.820 --> 05:02:37.620
Uh, I'm actually not sure apparently vigors

05:02:41.940 --> 05:02:46.740
Max is 60 before it starts to like heavily nerf yet. Yes six extra

05:02:47.540 --> 05:02:50.820
HP imagine if that would have made the difference though, you know

05:02:51.780 --> 05:02:55.460
Go to the church and head towards the wonder visit

05:02:57.540 --> 05:03:00.260
Endurance and vigour are both good picks at this point

05:03:00.500 --> 05:03:03.620
And I'll just put it in endurance. Why not?

05:03:04.740 --> 05:03:06.740
Cheeky bit of endurance here

05:03:06.900 --> 05:03:12.500
Okay, go to the church and head towards the wonders physics. Oh, yes. I know exactly what you're talking about refund

05:03:12.980 --> 05:03:17.940
I have I'm so smart in this game. What the fuck is it? Where the fuck am I supposed to go?

05:03:19.780 --> 05:03:21.780
Um this church

05:03:24.820 --> 05:03:26.820
This church

05:03:27.540 --> 05:03:29.540

05:03:40.900 --> 05:03:46.180
I've played this game once fully before and that was a year ago. Look a few things are not in my head

05:03:47.860 --> 05:03:51.140
Go to the church. What church this church?

Care to buy something. Yeah, I would love to. Can you sell me a physics?

05:04:14.420 --> 05:04:17.860
Is that crackpot you want me to summon will lead you? Okay. Okay. Okay

05:04:18.820 --> 05:04:27.220
Time to summon the reeflings to help me navigate this game because there's so much content

05:04:27.940 --> 05:04:29.940
Kind of just crazy

05:04:30.580 --> 05:04:34.100
I always see this animal name. I don't reckon. Oh, no. No. No. No. No

05:04:36.660 --> 05:04:38.660
Okay, uh future

Morning, don't do too close the mad reefing. Why are you mad?

05:04:44.180 --> 05:04:51.220
That's not good. The mad reefing. I'm not in a room on this piece of paper. The mad

05:04:52.580 --> 05:04:54.580
Where we have started column a

So we have one column two column. We're now got three column and we've got a boss fight column. Um

05:05:02.900 --> 05:05:06.820
Right, let's get pumpkin in as an adversary because I don't want to get in trouble

05:05:07.620 --> 05:05:09.940
I see someone's saying here, but it's not let me get you

05:05:10.660 --> 05:05:13.620

Red guy is the true main character

05:06:31.540 --> 05:06:37.220
Next cover Houdini where mummy is a girl with black hair joining forces against black rock

05:06:38.420 --> 05:06:40.580
Honestly

05:06:40.580 --> 05:06:43.620
I already know what I want my alternative outfit to be

05:06:46.500 --> 05:06:48.500

It's very it's very people cozy

05:06:53.540 --> 05:06:56.340
But I already know what I want my alternative outfit to be

05:06:57.220 --> 05:06:59.220
Um, however

05:06:59.220 --> 05:07:01.220
Depending on the donor song

Right, let's go. Let's welcome boys. Why don't do that?

05:07:47.540 --> 05:07:52.340
Okay, I forgot I need to level up these a little bit, but that's okay. We can do that in the end

05:07:53.060 --> 05:07:56.100
Did we just run past or we just perish on everyone?

05:07:59.540 --> 05:08:03.140
What if it's what the masses well if you guys vote for it then I ain't gonna say no

05:08:04.100 --> 05:08:08.740
I've got plenty of tails, but I can plug in with the uh be uh streaming out here

05:08:11.780 --> 05:08:13.140
Um

05:08:13.140 --> 05:08:15.140
Yeah, if you guys want, I ain't gonna

05:08:15.140 --> 05:08:19.140
Uh, but I would like vote. Why are you just hating in the bushes?

05:08:20.100 --> 05:08:22.100
Is that the boost to do that part?

05:08:24.260 --> 05:08:29.300
Yeah, I'm very open to like an alternative costume that you guys pick just like, you know what you want to see

05:08:29.940 --> 05:08:31.940
Wait, I need to hold this

05:08:35.060 --> 05:08:37.060
Wait

05:08:37.220 --> 05:08:39.220
So then what's that one?

05:08:39.700 --> 05:08:41.700
Okay, and what's that?

05:08:43.060 --> 05:08:45.060
Ah, right combination. Sorry

05:08:45.300 --> 05:08:47.300
Sorry

05:08:47.620 --> 05:08:49.620
Gamer girl outfit

05:08:49.940 --> 05:08:54.580
I mean, I've not got it concepted. Uh, maybe only talk about it if I got a concept

05:08:55.620 --> 05:08:58.420
But I'm definitely gonna stick to like my main

05:08:59.220 --> 05:09:03.140
Like for a lot. I really like the yukata. I'm sorry if anyone

05:09:04.740 --> 05:09:08.340
Uh, I'm sorry if anyone's like, you can't, that's weird. I'm like, plus

05:09:09.300 --> 05:09:15.780
No, no, no. Niveichuber would be here without a little homage to Japan. So I think a yukata makes perfect sense

05:09:17.780 --> 05:09:19.140
Um

05:09:19.140 --> 05:09:20.420
but

05:09:20.420 --> 05:09:25.380
Didn't like it I have to have a bikini only toggle if that's what you're wanting. I mean, yeah

05:09:28.180 --> 05:09:31.860
Are you and all it uh, that's a very alternative outfit indeed

05:09:32.580 --> 05:09:38.040
Wait, if you don't come near. Oh, no, they they always attack. I was gonna say he unsheathed his sword

05:09:38.340 --> 05:09:41.340
I was like, oh, does he not attack if they, like, they hit you?

05:09:42.340 --> 05:09:46.340
You can't, if it's a great though. Yeah, like, I just thought it was a really good thing.

05:09:46.340 --> 05:09:51.340
I definitely gonna develop some of my concept art because there's a few...

05:09:51.340 --> 05:09:56.340
There's a hidden design in one of the con... It's not hidden, but it looked really good

05:09:56.340 --> 05:09:59.340
and I want to see it develop just slightly further.

05:09:59.340 --> 05:10:02.340
I think it's very complementary to the hip-hop theme.

05:10:02.340 --> 05:10:03.340
Um...

05:10:05.340 --> 05:10:07.340
As well.

05:10:07.340 --> 05:10:09.340
So I'd like to see that.

05:10:12.340 --> 05:10:17.340
We are traversing limbry for this. This is getting pretty...

05:10:17.340 --> 05:10:19.340
We adventuring.

05:10:21.340 --> 05:10:23.340
I thought you couldn't draw. I can't.

05:10:23.340 --> 05:10:26.340
We're getting... I get concept art.

05:10:26.340 --> 05:10:28.340
Concept.

05:10:28.340 --> 05:10:30.340
Just a hidden...

05:10:30.340 --> 05:10:32.340
Again?

05:10:33.340 --> 05:10:38.340
Worldwinds, wolves from the sky? I have to admit are probably the weirdest thing.

05:10:39.340 --> 05:10:41.340
Wait, what? Is that an enemy?

05:10:41.340 --> 05:10:43.340
Whoa.

05:10:43.340 --> 05:10:46.340
Is that an NPC?

05:10:46.340 --> 05:10:49.340
Oh my god, I thought that was a rifling dressed up.

05:10:49.340 --> 05:10:52.340
I was like, oh, careful honey, you're hurting me.

05:10:52.340 --> 05:10:55.340
Careful, darling, you didn't mean to swing on me.

05:10:55.340 --> 05:10:58.340
Hypno from Pokemon Sun?

05:10:58.340 --> 05:11:00.340
Okay.

05:11:00.340 --> 05:11:03.340
Ooh, we're at a new place.

05:11:05.340 --> 05:11:07.340
Is this where I'm supposed to be going?

05:11:07.340 --> 05:11:10.340
Whoa, there's literally a growing granada.

05:11:10.340 --> 05:11:12.340
Whoa, there's a rat!

05:11:12.340 --> 05:11:15.340
Is that a rat? No, it's a dog.

05:11:15.340 --> 05:11:19.340
That dog has main cheese with that bit right now.

05:11:20.340 --> 05:11:22.340
Serious?

05:11:22.340 --> 05:11:26.340
I got a short sword. I was supposed to have a long sword.

05:11:28.340 --> 05:11:31.340
Oh jeez, you guys are glittering.

05:11:32.340 --> 05:11:34.340
Fin beast.

05:11:34.340 --> 05:11:37.340
Sorry, but you got two heads in.

05:11:37.340 --> 05:11:41.340
I'm really sorry to say it's because a lot of people put a lot of effort into it,

05:11:41.340 --> 05:11:44.340
but the clothes are almost useless for now.

05:11:44.340 --> 05:11:46.340
Oh yeah, no, definitely.

05:11:46.340 --> 05:11:49.340
I do agree with that sentiment as well.

05:11:49.340 --> 05:11:53.340
You literally only get to see my face and my hair.

05:11:54.340 --> 05:11:57.340
Pretty much like 100% of the time.

05:11:57.340 --> 05:11:59.340
I went reeflings.

05:11:59.340 --> 05:12:03.340
When v-tubers do just chanting streams and stuff,

05:12:03.340 --> 05:12:05.340
and they show half their body there,

05:12:05.340 --> 05:12:07.340
I'm like, yeah, no, that makes sense.

05:12:07.340 --> 05:12:09.340
Isn't Alexander up there?

05:12:10.340 --> 05:12:12.340
I know he's up a cliff to the right.

05:12:12.340 --> 05:12:13.340
Up a cliff.

05:12:13.340 --> 05:12:15.340
Did I just say what I think I said?

05:12:15.340 --> 05:12:17.340
Sorry.

05:12:17.340 --> 05:12:19.340
There's so many of you, it's got me overwhelmed.

05:12:19.340 --> 05:12:22.340
Oh, I'm to come up here? Wait, let me clean.

05:12:22.340 --> 05:12:24.340
Are you fighting a dragon or something?

05:12:24.340 --> 05:12:26.340
Why are you fighting on the bridge?

05:12:30.340 --> 05:12:32.340
If you think those doggos are bad,

05:12:32.340 --> 05:12:34.340
you should have seen the Dark Souls one.

05:12:34.340 --> 05:12:36.340
Wait, Pumpkin wants us to go up here?

05:12:36.340 --> 05:12:38.340
Am I going crazy?

05:12:38.340 --> 05:12:40.340
No.

05:12:44.340 --> 05:12:46.340
Oh, Hypno from Pokemon Cosplay soon.

05:12:46.340 --> 05:12:49.340
Sorry, I thought you were asking for a roleplay.

05:12:49.340 --> 05:12:51.340
I was like, why would I roleplay a Pokemon?

05:12:51.340 --> 05:12:53.340
Are you giving up Pumpkin now, Matt?

05:12:53.340 --> 05:12:55.340
Do I really want to be a pumpkin?

05:12:55.340 --> 05:12:57.340
I like my little tentacles.

05:12:57.340 --> 05:12:59.340
I think that was on the head.

05:12:59.340 --> 05:13:01.340
Alexander was up that cliff, I thought so.

05:13:01.340 --> 05:13:03.340
Congrats if your name's Alex, by the way.

05:13:03.340 --> 05:13:05.340
I just said your name.

05:13:05.340 --> 05:13:09.340
God, Alexander the NPC.

05:13:09.340 --> 05:13:11.340
It's kind of a trade-off between copper

05:13:11.340 --> 05:13:13.340
and shrink and more in the game.

05:13:13.340 --> 05:13:15.340
Nah, I'm teasing.

05:13:15.340 --> 05:13:17.340
You're teasing, I'm but-

05:13:17.340 --> 05:13:19.340
Oh, no.

05:13:19.340 --> 05:13:21.340
These are the ones where you have to whack the bones.

05:13:21.340 --> 05:13:23.340
I'm getting out of here.

05:13:23.340 --> 05:13:25.340
I hate the ones where you're like,

05:13:25.340 --> 05:13:27.340
there's one and done.

05:13:27.340 --> 05:13:29.340
I think that's why, even though it's probably more

05:13:29.340 --> 05:13:31.340
expensive, each of Models

05:13:31.340 --> 05:13:33.340
and sitting and reclining poses look great.

05:13:33.340 --> 05:13:35.340
Hmm.

05:13:35.340 --> 05:13:37.340
We actually,

05:13:37.340 --> 05:13:39.340
in development, I did entertain that

05:13:39.340 --> 05:13:41.340
and I would,

05:13:41.340 --> 05:13:43.340
like, have a, is it dynamic pose?

05:13:43.340 --> 05:13:45.340
Each of us at one point.

05:13:45.340 --> 05:13:47.340
Each of us at one point.

05:13:47.340 --> 05:13:49.340
But then I realized,

05:13:49.340 --> 05:13:51.340
like,

05:13:51.340 --> 05:13:53.340
the appeal is,

05:13:53.340 --> 05:13:55.340
you know,

05:13:55.340 --> 05:13:57.340
the girls are going to be streaming on YouTube.

05:13:57.340 --> 05:13:59.340
And

05:13:59.340 --> 05:14:01.340
depending on what they wanted to do,

05:14:01.340 --> 05:14:03.340
I didn't know if there was going to be someone

05:14:03.340 --> 05:14:05.340
who wanted to exclusively just do ASMR streams,

05:14:05.340 --> 05:14:07.340
because I know some creators are like that.

05:14:07.340 --> 05:14:09.340
And it was like

05:14:09.340 --> 05:14:11.340
to get, like, to spend even more

05:14:11.340 --> 05:14:13.340
on top of what the base price of the Models

05:14:13.340 --> 05:14:15.340
is for, like, some sort of dynamic pose.

05:14:15.340 --> 05:14:17.340
I definitely am open to the idea

05:14:17.340 --> 05:14:19.340
of it, but, like, for me, for example,

05:14:19.340 --> 05:14:21.340
I probably wouldn't use it

05:14:21.340 --> 05:14:23.340
because I'm like, I'm a shit

05:14:23.340 --> 05:14:25.340
VTuber in terms of, like, not using toggles,

05:14:25.340 --> 05:14:27.340
not doing this, not doing that.

05:14:27.340 --> 05:14:29.340
So I really would

05:14:29.340 --> 05:14:31.340
only invest in, like,

05:14:31.340 --> 05:14:33.340
an all-outfit, maybe.

05:14:33.340 --> 05:14:35.340
Like, um,

05:14:35.340 --> 05:14:37.340
Emmy's interested in, like, a straight-up

05:14:37.340 --> 05:14:39.340
2.0, which is fine.

05:14:39.340 --> 05:14:41.340
Um, but, like, for me,

05:14:41.340 --> 05:14:43.340
I personally had it. Like, I really

05:14:43.340 --> 05:14:45.340
like my model. Nari

05:14:45.340 --> 05:14:47.340
made me so expressive as well,

05:14:47.340 --> 05:14:49.340
like, seriously. I feel like

05:14:49.340 --> 05:14:51.340
I'm not, like, stiff

05:14:51.340 --> 05:14:53.340
or anything. I love how, like, I do

05:14:53.340 --> 05:14:55.340
think, sorry, my hands are starting to sweat.

05:14:55.340 --> 05:14:57.340
I need to wipe my hands on my hoodie.

05:14:57.340 --> 05:14:59.340
Ta-da!

05:14:59.340 --> 05:15:01.340
I'm a sweaty boy.

05:15:03.340 --> 05:15:05.340
We're going to Radan next

05:15:05.340 --> 05:15:07.340
to get

05:15:07.340 --> 05:15:09.340
DLC stuff. Sorry, I'm doing one-handed.

05:15:09.340 --> 05:15:11.340
I'm trying to hydrate because I didn't realize how much I'm sweating

05:15:11.340 --> 05:15:13.340
and I'm getting a bit worried that I'm going to be

05:15:13.340 --> 05:15:15.340
dehydrated. Well, what are you doing?

05:15:15.340 --> 05:15:17.340
Oh, sorry, my trigger got caught

05:15:17.340 --> 05:15:19.340
on the table.

05:15:19.340 --> 05:15:21.340
Wipe your hands

05:15:21.340 --> 05:15:23.340
on me.

05:15:23.340 --> 05:15:25.340
Oh, you're pointing.

05:15:25.340 --> 05:15:27.340
Oh, no!

05:15:27.340 --> 05:15:29.340
Wait, huh?

05:15:31.340 --> 05:15:33.340
Am I about to do a boss fight?

05:15:33.340 --> 05:15:35.340
Why can't I progress?

05:15:35.340 --> 05:15:37.340
No!

05:15:37.340 --> 05:15:39.340
Boss fight, because the reeflings can't be with me!

05:15:43.340 --> 05:15:45.340
Sugar.

05:15:45.340 --> 05:15:47.340
Oh, no.

05:15:47.340 --> 05:15:49.340
I don't want to use any stamina.

05:15:53.340 --> 05:15:55.340
Oh, no, this can't be.

05:15:55.340 --> 05:15:57.340
I've not leveled up my weapons or anything.

05:15:57.340 --> 05:15:59.340
Or got more flasks. Or got more seeds.

05:16:01.340 --> 05:16:03.340
I don't want to upset anyone.

05:16:07.340 --> 05:16:09.340
Is it in here?

05:16:09.340 --> 05:16:11.340
Where? Where are they?

05:16:11.340 --> 05:16:13.340
Oh!

05:16:13.340 --> 05:16:15.340
Come here, you bum.

05:16:15.340 --> 05:16:17.340
Come here, you bum. Just because I've not got my reeflings

05:16:17.340 --> 05:16:19.340
doesn't mean

05:16:19.340 --> 05:16:21.340
I'm not going to fucking give you everything I got.

05:16:27.340 --> 05:16:29.340
I'm out of stamina!

05:16:29.340 --> 05:16:31.340
Both of us are fucking

05:16:31.340 --> 05:16:33.340
stamina handy. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

05:16:33.340 --> 05:16:35.340
hold on, hold on, hold on, let me get the...

05:16:35.340 --> 05:16:37.340
Hold on, let me cheat. Hold on, let me cheat!

05:16:37.340 --> 05:16:39.340
Hold on, let me cheat. Let me cheat.

05:16:39.340 --> 05:16:41.340
I see that fucking thing.

05:16:41.340 --> 05:16:43.340
I see it. Let me cheat right now.

05:16:43.340 --> 05:16:45.340
GAN!

05:16:45.340 --> 05:16:47.340
GAN and save me!

05:16:47.340 --> 05:16:49.340
Unable to summon.

05:16:49.340 --> 05:16:51.340
Oh, mother...

05:16:53.340 --> 05:16:55.340
I need heal.

05:17:01.340 --> 05:17:03.340
We are both Wacken,

05:17:03.340 --> 05:17:05.340
but not staggering each other.

05:17:05.340 --> 05:17:07.340
That's quite funny.

05:17:07.340 --> 05:17:09.340
Speaking of staggers, take this.

05:17:09.340 --> 05:17:11.340
Oh, I'm missing.

05:17:11.340 --> 05:17:13.340
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

05:17:21.340 --> 05:17:23.340
Thank you.

05:17:25.340 --> 05:17:27.340
Thank you.

05:17:29.340 --> 05:17:31.340
Don't ever come around these parts again.

05:17:31.340 --> 05:17:33.340
Me and the Reeflings rule this neighborhood.

05:17:33.340 --> 05:17:35.340
That make myself clear.

05:17:35.340 --> 05:17:37.340
Woman.

05:17:37.340 --> 05:17:39.340
Cookbook. Of course you got Cookbook flying around.

05:17:39.340 --> 05:17:41.340
We've beaten them.

05:17:43.340 --> 05:17:45.340
What is your name?

05:17:47.340 --> 05:17:49.340
Well, in you come.

05:17:49.340 --> 05:17:51.340
Jeez, what a name.

05:17:53.340 --> 05:17:55.340
Is there anyone here who hasn't been in before?

05:17:55.340 --> 05:17:57.340
I did grab you.

05:18:01.340 --> 05:18:03.340
You look like an Edgelord McGee.

05:18:03.340 --> 05:18:05.340
Okay.

05:18:05.340 --> 05:18:07.340
And you come, Edgelord McGee.

05:18:09.340 --> 05:18:11.340
See, that's what I shouldn't have named.

05:18:11.340 --> 05:18:13.340
If I had a Scottish VTuber that I applied,

05:18:13.340 --> 05:18:15.340
I'll name him McGee something.

05:18:15.340 --> 05:18:17.340
Or something McGee, sorry.

05:18:17.340 --> 05:18:19.340
Is there any invaders?

05:18:19.340 --> 05:18:21.340
Anyone...

05:18:21.340 --> 05:18:23.340
Interesting in invading?

05:18:27.340 --> 05:18:29.340
I strongly say for you to get to the DLC station.

05:18:29.340 --> 05:18:31.340
I hope you're ready for some hard bosses.

05:18:31.340 --> 05:18:33.340
They have been wiping my ass.

05:18:33.340 --> 05:18:35.340
Oh, yeah, no.

05:18:35.340 --> 05:18:39.340
I have been doing very well.

05:18:39.340 --> 05:18:41.340
If you don't know, I'm actually a very skilled Elden Ring player.

05:18:41.340 --> 05:18:43.340
I'm actually really happy to announce

05:18:43.340 --> 05:18:45.340
I did a speed run of it one time.

05:18:45.340 --> 05:18:47.340
And I placed top 80.

05:18:47.340 --> 05:18:49.340
It wasn't the best speed run,

05:18:49.340 --> 05:18:51.340
but I'm actually pretty strong at the game.

05:18:51.340 --> 05:18:55.340
And I actually do not use the Reeflings at all

05:18:55.340 --> 05:18:57.340
in order to help me

05:18:57.340 --> 05:18:59.340
progress the storyline.

05:19:01.340 --> 05:19:03.340
Salad.

05:19:03.340 --> 05:19:05.340
I've actually been kind of abusing you a bit, Salad.

05:19:07.340 --> 05:19:09.340
I want strongy to invade my mind.

05:19:11.340 --> 05:19:13.340
Okay.

05:19:13.340 --> 05:19:15.340
Let me bless all three Reeflings

05:19:15.340 --> 05:19:17.340
that once the Invader Summer comes in.

05:19:19.340 --> 05:19:21.340
Oh my god, my notes are getting so scribbly.

05:19:21.340 --> 05:19:23.340
I can't even like...

05:19:23.340 --> 05:19:25.340
I'm trying to put tabs on

05:19:25.340 --> 05:19:27.340
like who's been coming in on that.

05:19:27.340 --> 05:19:29.340
But I have to admit, I've been fucking up really badly.

05:19:33.340 --> 05:19:35.340
Okay.

05:19:35.340 --> 05:19:37.340
All three Reeflings are ready.

05:19:37.340 --> 05:19:39.340
It's...

05:19:39.340 --> 05:19:41.340
I don't know what hole you're going to get.

05:19:41.340 --> 05:19:43.340
It's going to be over before you know it.

05:19:43.340 --> 05:19:45.340
That's all you need to know.

05:19:45.340 --> 05:19:47.340
Okay.

05:19:49.340 --> 05:19:51.340
Ready?

05:19:51.340 --> 05:19:53.340
He went first.

05:19:53.340 --> 05:19:55.340
He went first.

05:19:55.340 --> 05:19:57.340
Okay.

05:19:57.340 --> 05:19:59.340
Let's go.

05:19:59.340 --> 05:20:01.340
Yahoo.

05:20:01.340 --> 05:20:03.340
We will now follow.

05:20:13.340 --> 05:20:15.340
Wait, isn't there a dragon up here?

05:20:15.340 --> 05:20:17.340
Whoa.

05:20:17.340 --> 05:20:19.340
I didn't even see them.

05:20:19.340 --> 05:20:21.340
I'm so blind.

05:20:23.340 --> 05:20:25.340
Drawstring.

05:20:25.340 --> 05:20:27.340
Lightning greets.

05:20:27.340 --> 05:20:29.340
But not to be confused with grease and lightness.

05:20:31.340 --> 05:20:33.340
Keyleth.

05:20:33.340 --> 05:20:35.340
Any Keyleth enjoyers?

05:20:37.340 --> 05:20:39.340
What?

05:20:39.340 --> 05:20:41.340
Whoa, you look kind of scary.

05:20:41.340 --> 05:20:43.340
You're not going to lie with your weapons.

05:20:43.340 --> 05:20:45.340
Look at the freaking distance he has on his.

05:20:45.340 --> 05:20:47.340
Jeez, I don't want to go in a fight against you.

05:20:47.340 --> 05:20:49.340
Are you going to whip?

05:20:49.340 --> 05:20:51.340
Is that a whip?

05:20:51.340 --> 05:20:53.340
Wait, I need to whip.

05:20:53.340 --> 05:20:55.340
I can whip you guys.

05:20:55.340 --> 05:20:57.340
Sheevee sends her regards.

05:20:57.340 --> 05:20:59.340
Basically.

05:20:59.340 --> 05:21:01.340
Okay, we're going.

05:21:01.340 --> 05:21:03.340
Following the Reeflings.

05:21:03.340 --> 05:21:05.340
Reeflings are following the Reeflings.

05:21:05.340 --> 05:21:07.340
So we complete the DLC.

05:21:07.340 --> 05:21:09.340
It costs an extra $60.

05:21:09.340 --> 05:21:11.340
$60.

05:21:11.340 --> 05:21:13.340
It costs an extra $60.

05:21:13.340 --> 05:21:15.340
But apparently it's really good.

05:21:15.340 --> 05:21:17.340
The Reeflings are kind of splitting a bit.

05:21:17.340 --> 05:21:19.340
Oh no, we're avoiding that little army there.

05:21:21.340 --> 05:21:23.340
Who enjoys Keyleth?

05:21:23.340 --> 05:21:25.340
Question 1.

05:21:27.340 --> 05:21:29.340
More if you're feeling

05:21:29.340 --> 05:21:31.340
especially daring.

05:21:33.340 --> 05:21:35.340
Five?

05:21:41.340 --> 05:21:43.340
I mean, if you want to get

05:21:43.340 --> 05:21:45.340
technical

05:21:45.340 --> 05:21:47.340
six

05:21:47.340 --> 05:21:49.340
on a Waman.

05:21:49.340 --> 05:21:51.340
For maximum

05:21:51.340 --> 05:21:53.340
maximum

05:21:53.340 --> 05:21:55.340
maximum

05:21:55.340 --> 05:21:57.340
uh

05:21:57.340 --> 05:21:59.340
Holy

05:21:59.340 --> 05:22:01.340
I can't believe I'm saying that.

05:22:01.340 --> 05:22:03.340
Yeah.

05:22:03.340 --> 05:22:05.340
For max efficiency is six.

05:22:07.340 --> 05:22:09.340
If you want to min max a woman

05:22:09.340 --> 05:22:11.340
six.

05:22:11.340 --> 05:22:13.340
Okay.

05:22:13.340 --> 05:22:15.340
I'm just letting magic deal

05:22:15.340 --> 05:22:17.340
with these dogs. They're terrifying, honestly.

05:22:17.340 --> 05:22:19.340
They do look like T-Rex people.

05:22:19.340 --> 05:22:21.340
I do have to give

05:22:21.340 --> 05:22:23.340
off my hat to the game design.

05:22:23.340 --> 05:22:25.340
Seriously, like all these different aspects.

05:22:25.340 --> 05:22:27.340
This game development

05:22:27.340 --> 05:22:29.340
must have been

05:22:29.340 --> 05:22:31.340
very long.

05:22:31.340 --> 05:22:33.340
Six. Yeah, but I feel a difference in quality

05:22:33.340 --> 05:22:35.340
between the best and worst

05:22:35.340 --> 05:22:37.340
through astronomical. What about pit?

05:22:37.340 --> 05:22:39.340
It's not a hole though.

05:22:39.340 --> 05:22:41.340
It would be nose

05:22:41.340 --> 05:22:43.340
ears, mouse

05:22:43.340 --> 05:22:45.340
babina

05:22:45.340 --> 05:22:47.340
booty

05:22:47.340 --> 05:22:49.340
and then

05:22:49.340 --> 05:22:51.340
that's what

05:22:55.340 --> 05:22:57.340
nose and ears

05:22:57.340 --> 05:22:59.340
will take another

05:22:59.340 --> 05:23:01.340
anything.

05:23:01.340 --> 05:23:03.340
She

05:23:03.340 --> 05:23:05.340
Oh, they blew up.

05:23:05.340 --> 05:23:07.340
I thought it was one of you guys doing magic on

05:23:07.340 --> 05:23:09.340
me.

05:23:09.340 --> 05:23:11.340
Sorry, the reeflings like

05:23:11.340 --> 05:23:13.340
leading me on this quest or something like

05:23:13.340 --> 05:23:15.340
contemplating the uh

05:23:15.340 --> 05:23:17.340
the true ultimate number

05:23:19.340 --> 05:23:21.340
was a hole again.

05:23:21.340 --> 05:23:23.340
Yeah, but the pits aren't

05:23:23.340 --> 05:23:25.340
uh and it's like a

05:23:25.340 --> 05:23:27.340
it doesn't have an end to it if you will.

05:23:27.340 --> 05:23:29.340
I actually

05:23:29.340 --> 05:23:31.340
thought when AC was actually

05:23:31.340 --> 05:23:33.340
getting concepts with

05:23:33.340 --> 05:23:35.340
I'm so sorry to bring this upon you.

05:23:35.340 --> 05:23:37.340
Um

05:23:37.340 --> 05:23:39.340
I actually thought about commissioning

05:23:39.340 --> 05:23:41.340
the ear artwork for her

05:23:41.340 --> 05:23:43.340
like of her

05:23:43.340 --> 05:23:45.340
but I was like I don't want to do that

05:23:45.340 --> 05:23:47.340
if that would make her uncomfortable because I didn't know at the time

05:23:47.340 --> 05:23:49.340
like what the comfort level of the girls are

05:23:49.340 --> 05:23:51.340
as far as I'm aware

05:23:51.340 --> 05:23:53.340
everything fucking goes.

05:23:53.340 --> 05:23:55.340
Everyone's like on the same page of like

05:23:55.340 --> 05:23:57.340
if I don't like it, I just won't interact

05:23:57.340 --> 05:23:59.340
so don't be surprised if I don't interact

05:23:59.340 --> 05:24:01.340
type thing and then that's it.

05:24:01.340 --> 05:24:03.340
Ear artwork

05:24:03.340 --> 05:24:05.340
have you not

05:24:05.340 --> 05:24:07.340
oh no

05:24:07.340 --> 05:24:09.340
are we about to show a reefling

05:24:09.340 --> 05:24:11.340
one of the most cursed things ever?

05:24:13.340 --> 05:24:15.340
So there's this

05:24:15.340 --> 05:24:17.340
really famous

05:24:17.340 --> 05:24:19.340
Neco animation

05:24:19.340 --> 05:24:21.340
and it's like a Neco girl

05:24:21.340 --> 05:24:23.340
which has got Neco ears

05:24:25.340 --> 05:24:27.340
and

05:24:27.340 --> 05:24:29.340
how am I getting ashes of war?

05:24:29.340 --> 05:24:31.340
I'm done it. Life steal fits

05:24:31.340 --> 05:24:33.340
oh you can yank HP as you

05:24:33.340 --> 05:24:35.340
fist someone that's my kind of doctor

05:24:35.340 --> 05:24:37.340
your math ain't mathin

05:24:37.340 --> 05:24:39.340
oh are you talking about ear smashing?

05:24:39.340 --> 05:24:41.340
yeah

05:24:41.340 --> 05:24:43.340
I think that's what it's called I guess

05:24:43.340 --> 05:24:45.340
oh wait, mumbling

05:24:45.340 --> 05:24:47.340
hold on, hold on I have to take my glycol

05:24:49.340 --> 05:24:51.340
the ears aren't designed for that

05:24:51.340 --> 05:24:53.340
no I know but I thought I would beat someone

05:24:53.340 --> 05:24:55.340
to the chase and do it for icing

05:24:55.340 --> 05:24:57.340
and if she found it funny she can post it

05:24:57.340 --> 05:24:59.340
if she didn't she didn't have to

05:24:59.340 --> 05:25:01.340
do the artwork

05:25:01.340 --> 05:25:03.340
the concert artists of me and AC together

05:25:03.340 --> 05:25:05.340
it's not like a major thing

05:25:05.340 --> 05:25:07.340
it's just like AC is

05:25:11.340 --> 05:25:13.340
but you guys just think it funny

05:25:13.340 --> 05:25:15.340
I won't post it yet cause

05:25:17.340 --> 05:25:19.340
I guess I need to ask her

05:25:19.340 --> 05:25:21.340
although she's already seen it and she laughed at it

05:25:21.340 --> 05:25:23.340
she found it funny

05:25:23.340 --> 05:25:25.340
um

05:25:25.340 --> 05:25:27.340
tell that to the R34

05:25:27.340 --> 05:25:29.340
oh someone messaged

05:25:29.340 --> 05:25:31.340
like a week back

05:25:31.340 --> 05:25:33.340
and they were like congrats you guys have

05:25:33.340 --> 05:25:35.340
the R34 tags and I'm like

05:25:35.340 --> 05:25:37.340
oh my god poggers already

05:25:37.340 --> 05:25:39.340
feels good man

05:25:39.340 --> 05:25:41.340
I mean if it worked

05:25:41.340 --> 05:25:43.340
in scary movie

05:25:43.340 --> 05:25:45.340
okay we're gonna do this fight

05:25:45.340 --> 05:25:47.340
and then

05:25:47.340 --> 05:25:49.340
I'm gonna have to get some food in my tum tum

05:25:49.340 --> 05:25:51.340
I got

05:25:51.340 --> 05:25:53.340
natural

05:25:53.340 --> 05:25:55.340
like I ordered them yesterday

05:25:55.340 --> 05:25:57.340
so I can eat them today like a 5 head

05:25:57.340 --> 05:25:59.340
so I didn't have to make any food

05:26:03.340 --> 05:26:05.340
I assume it's this way

05:26:05.340 --> 05:26:07.340
oh no we're splitting off

05:26:07.340 --> 05:26:09.340
hold on a minute

05:26:09.340 --> 05:26:11.340
we've got conflict of interest conflict of interest

05:26:11.340 --> 05:26:13.340

05:26:13.340 --> 05:26:15.340

05:26:15.340 --> 05:26:17.340
I'm not real

05:26:17.340 --> 05:26:19.340
you can't see me

05:26:19.340 --> 05:26:21.340
did I activate that dragon

05:26:21.340 --> 05:26:23.340
oh you're taking me to the church

05:26:23.340 --> 05:26:25.340
we activated the dragon

05:26:25.340 --> 05:26:27.340
just a little bit

05:26:27.340 --> 05:26:29.340
it's okay though

05:26:29.340 --> 05:26:31.340
it's okay

05:26:31.340 --> 05:26:33.340
everything is cool

05:26:33.340 --> 05:26:35.340
it's okay

05:26:35.340 --> 05:26:37.340
we are going to get

05:26:37.340 --> 05:26:39.340

05:26:41.340 --> 05:26:43.340
what does he do

05:26:43.340 --> 05:26:45.340
I'll get my bone out of the way

05:26:45.340 --> 05:26:47.340
it looks like I won't

05:26:47.340 --> 05:26:49.340
do you fly

05:26:49.340 --> 05:26:51.340
do you fly

05:26:51.340 --> 05:26:53.340
oh my god the solo

05:26:53.340 --> 05:26:55.340
refling doesn't give a flying

05:26:55.340 --> 05:26:57.340
who is the dragon

05:26:57.340 --> 05:26:59.340
oh he's getting rotted out the wazoo

05:26:59.340 --> 05:27:01.340
he takes 60%

05:27:01.340 --> 05:27:03.340
it does manage to heal up

05:27:03.340 --> 05:27:05.340
it's not a problem for him

05:27:05.340 --> 05:27:07.340
the dragon already experiencing

05:27:07.340 --> 05:27:09.340
roughly 8% max health

05:27:09.340 --> 05:27:11.340
it's going down

05:27:11.340 --> 05:27:13.340
the second refling coming in to help

05:27:13.340 --> 05:27:15.340
I have no idea where invader refling is

05:27:15.340 --> 05:27:17.340

05:27:17.340 --> 05:27:19.340
without punching sounds

05:27:19.340 --> 05:27:21.340
oh other reflings

05:27:21.340 --> 05:27:23.340
are out of bounds

05:27:23.340 --> 05:27:25.340

at this shrine

05:30:03.340 --> 05:30:05.340
wow this place felt absolutely obliterated

05:30:05.340 --> 05:30:07.340
why

05:30:07.340 --> 05:30:09.340
why did I get so scared

05:30:13.340 --> 05:30:15.340
I get so scared when I hear noise on the wall

05:30:15.340 --> 05:30:17.340
okay I'm gonna rest

05:30:17.340 --> 05:30:19.340
so I can restore everything

05:30:19.340 --> 05:30:21.340
strongly struggling with NPC

05:30:21.340 --> 05:30:23.340

05:30:23.340 --> 05:30:25.340

why are you so far away

05:30:41.340 --> 05:30:43.340
is something wrong with this place

05:30:45.340 --> 05:30:47.340
cause it's uneven terrain

05:30:51.340 --> 05:30:53.340
I'm strange

05:30:53.340 --> 05:30:55.340

here we can

05:31:01.340 --> 05:31:03.340
I guess I won't put a tally

05:31:03.340 --> 05:31:05.340
cause you guys are just guiding me

05:31:05.340 --> 05:31:07.340
where I need to go

05:31:19.340 --> 05:31:21.340
I actually don't know the words

05:31:21.340 --> 05:31:23.340
they're doing beatle just

05:31:29.340 --> 05:31:31.340
I

05:31:33.340 --> 05:31:35.340
I could

05:31:35.340 --> 05:31:37.340
be very quiet

05:31:37.340 --> 05:31:39.340
be very very quiet

05:31:39.340 --> 05:31:41.340
refling

05:31:41.340 --> 05:31:43.340
there's an enemy right over there

05:31:45.340 --> 05:31:47.340
why is there no others

05:31:47.340 --> 05:31:49.340
I said be quiet

05:31:49.340 --> 05:31:51.340

05:31:51.340 --> 05:31:53.340
wait where can I assign

05:31:53.340 --> 05:31:55.340
a second refling

05:31:55.340 --> 05:31:57.340
okay take me where we need to go

05:31:57.340 --> 05:31:59.340
I'm so sorry to any refling

05:31:59.340 --> 05:32:01.340
put their mark down there I think that's glitched cause

05:32:01.340 --> 05:32:03.340
the area goes downwards on the map

05:32:05.340 --> 05:32:07.340
we don't have to be quiet anymore

05:32:07.340 --> 05:32:09.340
like a weeping

05:32:09.340 --> 05:32:11.340
I'm not actually sure how to hit enemies

05:32:11.340 --> 05:32:13.340
as a summon jola

05:32:13.340 --> 05:32:15.340
enemy

05:32:15.340 --> 05:32:17.340
I don't think it's a bad refling

05:32:17.340 --> 05:32:19.340
I don't know why

05:32:19.340 --> 05:32:21.340
there really isn't any mark that spawned in

05:32:21.340 --> 05:32:23.340
it must be glitched we'll go to the next one

05:32:23.340 --> 05:32:25.340
I have one refling to protect me

05:32:25.340 --> 05:32:27.340
it'll be fine

05:32:27.340 --> 05:32:29.340
wait where the heck did you guys go

05:32:29.340 --> 05:32:31.340
jeez you guys remember this again

05:32:31.340 --> 05:32:33.340
wow

05:32:33.340 --> 05:32:35.340
look at that tree

05:32:35.340 --> 05:32:37.340
oh it looks like a skull

05:32:37.340 --> 05:32:39.340
do you see it

05:32:39.340 --> 05:32:41.340
oh it must be a skull

05:32:41.340 --> 05:32:43.340
that's not a coincidence

05:32:43.340 --> 05:32:45.340
that's clearly been altered

05:32:45.340 --> 05:32:47.340

05:32:47.340 --> 05:32:49.340

just a heads up for upgrades

05:33:19.340 --> 05:33:21.340
while the guts sword is based

05:33:21.340 --> 05:33:23.340
it's a pain to upgrade

05:33:23.340 --> 05:33:25.340
it'll take 110 upgrade items

05:33:25.340 --> 05:33:27.340
to reach max level

05:33:27.340 --> 05:33:29.340
if you use a unique

05:33:29.340 --> 05:33:31.340
somber weapon

05:33:31.340 --> 05:33:33.340
it only takes 10 items

05:33:33.340 --> 05:33:35.340
okay

05:33:35.340 --> 05:33:37.340
I've not heard of that guts weapon

05:33:37.340 --> 05:33:39.340

05:33:41.340 --> 05:33:43.340

05:36:43.340 --> 05:36:45.340
what are they called a philosopher

05:36:45.340 --> 05:36:47.340

oopsies

05:36:55.340 --> 05:36:57.340

a little bit more to the left

05:36:59.340 --> 05:37:01.340
we need to go back a little bit okay

05:37:01.340 --> 05:37:03.340

05:37:03.340 --> 05:37:05.340
we might get attacked by those birds though

05:37:05.340 --> 05:37:07.340
maybe if we

05:37:07.340 --> 05:37:09.340
if we like stealth

05:37:11.340 --> 05:37:13.340
that would be okay

05:37:13.340 --> 05:37:15.340
I think we can do it

05:37:15.340 --> 05:37:17.340
I sophisticated refling

05:37:17.340 --> 05:37:19.340

05:37:51.340 --> 05:37:53.340
I would like to buy

05:37:53.340 --> 05:37:55.340
cause you have anything of interest

05:37:55.340 --> 05:37:57.340
gravity's advantage

05:37:57.340 --> 05:37:59.340
note imparting knowledge and brief

05:37:59.340 --> 05:38:01.340

05:38:01.340 --> 05:38:03.340
I mean

05:38:03.340 --> 05:38:05.340
I'll buy it I guess

05:38:05.340 --> 05:38:07.340
cause we might need it for crafting something

05:38:07.340 --> 05:38:09.340
but thank you

05:38:09.340 --> 05:38:11.340
I would now

05:38:11.340 --> 05:38:13.340
where do we go

05:38:13.340 --> 05:38:15.340
back this way

05:38:15.340 --> 05:38:17.340
the wind forgets me every time

05:38:17.340 --> 05:38:19.340
I was like who goes there

05:38:19.340 --> 05:38:21.340
identify yourself refling

05:38:21.340 --> 05:38:23.340
oh sorry

05:38:23.340 --> 05:38:25.340
I don't know

05:38:25.340 --> 05:38:27.340
I don't know if you're like

05:38:27.340 --> 05:38:29.340
self impaled on my

05:38:29.340 --> 05:38:31.340
cookbooks or the

05:38:31.340 --> 05:38:33.340
I'm like I'm crafted an item

05:38:33.340 --> 05:38:35.340
this entire run so far

05:38:35.340 --> 05:38:37.340
then again I haven't had to do

05:38:37.340 --> 05:38:39.340
thank god

05:38:39.340 --> 05:38:41.340
and I wouldn't have it any other way

05:38:41.340 --> 05:38:43.340
but yes

05:38:43.340 --> 05:38:45.340
there is delay

05:38:45.340 --> 05:38:47.340
is doing doodles

05:38:47.340 --> 05:38:49.340
question mark

05:38:49.340 --> 05:38:51.340
and our membership is open

05:38:51.340 --> 05:38:53.340
show your literal mother some love

05:38:53.340 --> 05:38:55.340
that's right

05:38:55.340 --> 05:38:57.340
she's your mommy

05:38:57.340 --> 05:38:59.340
you crafted the things

05:38:59.340 --> 05:39:01.340
that show you everyone's mark

05:39:01.340 --> 05:39:03.340
I am a crafter

05:39:03.340 --> 05:39:05.340
oh I'm so good

05:39:07.340 --> 05:39:09.340
I'm so smart

05:39:09.340 --> 05:39:11.340
throw money at Azura

05:39:11.340 --> 05:39:13.340
I got it

05:39:13.340 --> 05:39:15.340
I'm trying to help her move out

05:39:15.340 --> 05:39:17.340
she's got a little bit work to do

05:39:17.340 --> 05:39:19.340
with the audios

05:39:19.340 --> 05:39:21.340
I can help her with the youtube audios

05:39:21.340 --> 05:39:23.340
which means

05:39:23.340 --> 05:39:25.340
everyone gets access

05:39:25.340 --> 05:39:27.340
and then hopefully

05:39:27.340 --> 05:39:29.340
she might be able to move out after one month

05:39:29.340 --> 05:39:31.340
but I am going

05:39:31.340 --> 05:39:33.340
to tell her to make sure you have like

05:39:33.340 --> 05:39:35.340
triple

05:39:35.340 --> 05:39:37.340
the rent

05:39:37.340 --> 05:39:39.340
and your savings

05:39:39.340 --> 05:39:41.340
because I don't want

05:39:41.340 --> 05:39:43.340
any issues I don't know how renting in America works

05:39:43.340 --> 05:39:45.340
but I've heard some weird horror stories

05:39:45.340 --> 05:39:47.340
so I need to make sure

05:39:47.340 --> 05:39:49.340
she's like stacked out the wazoo

05:39:49.340 --> 05:39:51.340
so there is no problem

05:39:51.340 --> 05:39:53.340
in that

05:39:53.340 --> 05:39:55.340
she's so mummy

05:39:55.340 --> 05:39:57.340
but you're mome

05:39:57.340 --> 05:39:59.340
yes I'm mome

05:39:59.340 --> 05:40:01.340
but she's your literal mum

05:40:01.340 --> 05:40:03.340
I need to take this portal

05:40:03.340 --> 05:40:05.340
I think this is the clearest indication

05:40:05.340 --> 05:40:07.340
I need to take this particular portal

05:40:07.340 --> 05:40:09.340
I believe I understand your communication

05:40:09.340 --> 05:40:11.340
flap flap flap

05:40:11.340 --> 05:40:13.340
yes

05:40:13.340 --> 05:40:15.340
yeah depending on her credit

05:40:15.340 --> 05:40:17.340
we might ask her about your portal

05:40:19.340 --> 05:40:21.340
I don't know how

05:40:21.340 --> 05:40:23.340
wait

05:40:27.340 --> 05:40:29.340
I suppose

05:40:29.340 --> 05:40:31.340
when I had to rent

05:40:31.340 --> 05:40:33.340
because I said I was self employed

05:40:33.340 --> 05:40:35.340
they were like

05:40:35.340 --> 05:40:37.340
prove you have money and I'm like

05:40:37.340 --> 05:40:39.340
okay

05:40:39.340 --> 05:40:41.340
wait

05:40:41.340 --> 05:40:43.340
yeah I don't have it

05:40:43.340 --> 05:40:45.340
and so I have to like show them

05:40:45.340 --> 05:40:47.340
like hey I make this much money

05:40:47.340 --> 05:40:49.340
please let me have somewhere to live

05:40:49.340 --> 05:40:51.340
that'd be great

05:40:51.340 --> 05:40:53.340
wait you're not open

05:40:53.340 --> 05:40:55.340
cannot be you

05:40:55.340 --> 05:40:57.340
oh no

05:40:57.340 --> 05:40:59.340
oh no this can't be

05:41:01.340 --> 05:41:03.340
do we need to defeat more main bosses

05:41:03.340 --> 05:41:05.340
I think

05:41:05.340 --> 05:41:07.340
yeah it depends

05:41:07.340 --> 05:41:09.340
wait she needs to get to

05:41:09.340 --> 05:41:11.340
Altus

05:41:11.340 --> 05:41:13.340
is that other way

05:41:13.340 --> 05:41:15.340
is this Altus

05:41:15.340 --> 05:41:17.340
like across

05:41:17.340 --> 05:41:19.340
across the bridge

05:41:19.340 --> 05:41:21.340
go to Altus Plateau

05:41:21.340 --> 05:41:23.340

05:41:25.340 --> 05:41:27.340
oh my stomach

05:41:27.340 --> 05:41:29.340
just farted internally

05:41:29.340 --> 05:41:31.340
if you heard that

05:41:31.340 --> 05:41:33.340
I've not taken the lift no

05:41:33.340 --> 05:41:35.340
I've defeated two bosses and I'm getting

05:41:35.340 --> 05:41:37.340
my hand carried

05:41:37.340 --> 05:41:39.340

05:41:39.340 --> 05:41:41.340
Alice is about the huge lift

05:41:41.340 --> 05:41:43.340

05:41:53.340 --> 05:41:55.340
the temple quarter

05:41:55.340 --> 05:41:57.340
great

05:41:57.340 --> 05:41:59.340
go back to Linaria

05:41:59.340 --> 05:42:01.340
why is it

05:42:01.340 --> 05:42:03.340
the four bell freeze

05:42:03.340 --> 05:42:05.340
Linaria or like

05:42:05.340 --> 05:42:07.340
the

05:42:07.340 --> 05:42:09.340

05:42:09.340 --> 05:42:11.340
internal fart

05:42:11.340 --> 05:42:13.340
yeah when your stomach makes like internal

05:42:13.340 --> 05:42:15.340
digestion you can hear like

05:42:15.340 --> 05:42:17.340
the gasses on that river

05:42:17.340 --> 05:42:19.340
you either have to start the round request lane which will activate it

05:42:19.340 --> 05:42:21.340
or scale

05:42:21.340 --> 05:42:23.340
to Altaville

05:42:23.340 --> 05:42:25.340
lift or main

05:42:25.340 --> 05:42:27.340
below the bell free

05:42:31.340 --> 05:42:33.340
oh the round request

05:42:33.340 --> 05:42:35.340
that must have been how I triggered it

05:42:35.340 --> 05:42:37.340

05:43:29.340 --> 05:43:31.340
in the middle of this thing

05:43:31.340 --> 05:43:33.340

05:43:39.340 --> 05:43:41.340

05:43:43.340 --> 05:43:45.340
oh wait no I can't do invader first

05:43:45.340 --> 05:43:47.340
because it can't deserve the other one

05:43:49.340 --> 05:43:51.340
and you're too insane

05:43:51.340 --> 05:43:53.340

05:44:15.340 --> 05:44:17.340

05:44:27.340 --> 05:44:29.340
finish we'll play different games

05:44:29.340 --> 05:44:31.340
I

05:44:31.340 --> 05:44:33.340
okay

05:44:33.340 --> 05:44:35.340
okay

05:44:35.340 --> 05:44:37.340
is that my connection

05:44:37.340 --> 05:44:39.340
it's taking so long

05:44:43.340 --> 05:44:45.340
her back door

05:44:45.340 --> 05:44:47.340
Alice we go yes

05:44:47.340 --> 05:44:49.340
people haven't arrived to put down the marks yet

05:44:49.340 --> 05:44:51.340
they were just putting them down at the other spot

05:44:51.340 --> 05:44:53.340
oh when they thought I was runescape never ends

05:44:53.340 --> 05:44:55.340
no someone said

05:44:55.340 --> 05:44:57.340
statistically if I do two 12 hour

05:44:57.340 --> 05:44:59.340
endurance streams I'll have 99

05:44:59.340 --> 05:45:01.340
cookies

05:45:01.340 --> 05:45:03.340
unable to summon

05:45:03.340 --> 05:45:05.340
no

05:45:07.340 --> 05:45:09.340
must be my connection

05:45:09.340 --> 05:45:11.340
who didn't get in there was that

05:45:13.340 --> 05:45:15.340
that was zero of sanity

05:45:17.340 --> 05:45:19.340
my connection is wavering

05:45:19.340 --> 05:45:21.340
it's not having a

05:45:21.340 --> 05:45:23.340
let me check what it says

05:45:23.340 --> 05:45:25.340
multiplayer group

05:45:25.340 --> 05:45:27.340
multiplayer of settings

05:45:27.340 --> 05:45:29.340
reef

05:45:29.340 --> 05:45:31.340
there's nothing else to it

05:45:35.340 --> 05:45:37.340
if no one can connect

05:45:37.340 --> 05:45:39.340
there's definitely me having a moment

05:45:39.340 --> 05:45:41.340
runescape grinding in the background

05:45:41.340 --> 05:45:43.340
for tinfoil yuffin

05:45:43.340 --> 05:45:45.340
could that be their server

05:45:45.340 --> 05:45:47.340
yes actually before I start accusations

05:45:47.340 --> 05:45:49.340
against Australian internet

05:45:49.340 --> 05:45:51.340
it's very plausible their servers

05:45:51.340 --> 05:45:53.340
are overriding right now

05:45:53.340 --> 05:45:55.340
they're going ham

05:45:55.340 --> 05:45:57.340
they're going full time because everyone's having to read each other

05:45:57.340 --> 05:45:59.340
and all that

05:46:01.340 --> 05:46:03.340
unable of god are the servers

05:46:03.340 --> 05:46:05.340
down

05:46:07.340 --> 05:46:09.340
you think the servers might be down for connecting

05:46:09.340 --> 05:46:11.340
and I'm actually going to have to do something on my own

05:46:11.340 --> 05:46:13.340
hello

05:46:13.340 --> 05:46:15.340

cage that reeflings technical

05:49:59.340 --> 05:50:01.340

05:50:01.340 --> 05:50:03.340
a bug

05:50:03.340 --> 05:50:05.340
a flag

05:50:05.340 --> 05:50:07.340
someone killed something

05:50:07.340 --> 05:50:09.340
and I got the flag

05:50:09.340 --> 05:50:11.340
for it

05:50:11.340 --> 05:50:13.340
the only betrayal we would do

05:50:13.340 --> 05:50:15.340
is a reverse of the usual

05:50:15.340 --> 05:50:17.340
and out of nowhere using the front door

05:50:17.340 --> 05:50:19.340
yeah how dare you

05:50:19.340 --> 05:50:21.340
I do like the idea of

05:50:21.340 --> 05:50:23.340
the old bandage

05:50:23.340 --> 05:50:25.340
the old bandage

05:50:25.340 --> 05:50:27.340
I like those

05:50:27.340 --> 05:50:29.340
underwear as well

05:50:29.340 --> 05:50:31.340
that cover up that section

05:50:31.340 --> 05:50:33.340
but don't have a section

05:50:33.340 --> 05:50:35.340
for the back door

05:50:35.340 --> 05:50:37.340
of the house

05:50:37.340 --> 05:50:39.340
those underwear

05:50:39.340 --> 05:50:41.340
are really good

05:50:45.340 --> 05:50:47.340
one's a crusty bus station

05:50:47.340 --> 05:50:49.340
something like that

05:50:49.340 --> 05:50:51.340
there's a good mark of grace over here

05:50:51.340 --> 05:50:53.340
hold on I'm going to grab it

05:50:55.340 --> 05:50:57.340
everyone asks howardens

05:50:57.340 --> 05:50:59.340
but never whyardens

05:51:03.340 --> 05:51:05.340
oh so when the reefling

05:51:05.340 --> 05:51:07.340
tapes it's funny but if I see it

05:51:07.340 --> 05:51:09.340
out loud it's not funny

05:51:11.340 --> 05:51:13.340
you guys have some attitude on you tonight

05:51:13.340 --> 05:51:15.340
you know that

05:51:15.340 --> 05:51:17.340
I'd like to perish

05:51:19.340 --> 05:51:21.340
okay

05:51:21.340 --> 05:51:23.340
okay let's go again

05:51:23.340 --> 05:51:25.340
what are you doing

05:51:25.340 --> 05:51:27.340
what are you doing to that tree

05:51:27.340 --> 05:51:29.340
a bandage

05:51:29.340 --> 05:51:31.340
yes

05:51:31.340 --> 05:51:33.340
so there's this act

05:51:33.340 --> 05:51:35.340
of

05:51:35.340 --> 05:51:37.340
hooting

05:51:41.340 --> 05:51:43.340
and an empty apple

05:51:43.340 --> 05:51:45.340
and the apple like you take the guts out of the apple

05:51:45.340 --> 05:51:47.340
and then you fill it with

05:51:47.340 --> 05:51:49.340
this toffee

05:51:49.340 --> 05:51:51.340
sticky toffee

05:51:51.340 --> 05:51:53.340
like a candied apple

05:51:53.340 --> 05:51:55.340
and then you put

05:51:55.340 --> 05:51:57.340
the lid back on

05:51:57.340 --> 05:51:59.340
or the lid could be a plaster

05:51:59.340 --> 05:52:01.340
of the sticky apple

05:52:01.340 --> 05:52:03.340
what

05:52:03.340 --> 05:52:05.340
thunderbolts and lightning

05:52:05.340 --> 05:52:07.340
very very frightening

05:52:07.340 --> 05:52:09.340
oh wait these are the thunderbol

05:52:09.340 --> 05:52:11.340

05:52:45.340 --> 05:52:47.340

05:52:53.340 --> 05:52:55.340
but

05:52:55.340 --> 05:52:57.340
um

05:52:57.340 --> 05:52:59.340
the cake is so big

05:52:59.340 --> 05:53:01.340
that you actually

05:53:01.340 --> 05:53:03.340
even if I were to

05:53:03.340 --> 05:53:05.340
put on

05:53:05.340 --> 05:53:07.340
those kind of underwear

05:53:07.340 --> 05:53:09.340
you actually couldn't see anything

05:53:09.340 --> 05:53:11.340
because the cake is so big

05:53:11.340 --> 05:53:13.340
does that make sense

05:53:13.340 --> 05:53:15.340
I think that makes sense

05:53:17.340 --> 05:53:19.340
whimpering this way

05:53:21.340 --> 05:53:23.340
bandaid

05:53:23.340 --> 05:53:25.340
lingerie, lots of good options

05:53:25.340 --> 05:53:27.340
the bandaid after

05:53:27.340 --> 05:53:29.340
yeah

05:53:29.340 --> 05:53:31.340
it's not a well guarded secret

05:53:33.340 --> 05:53:35.340
what gave it away the clapping ASMR

05:53:37.340 --> 05:53:39.340
oh yes

05:53:39.340 --> 05:53:41.340
I will sit

05:53:41.340 --> 05:53:43.340
are you telling me to sit

05:53:43.340 --> 05:53:45.340
I will touch it

05:53:47.340 --> 05:53:49.340
I think we need the evidence

05:53:49.340 --> 05:53:51.340
is this where I'm like donut thunder

05:53:51.340 --> 05:53:53.340
I know like people in a vtuber

05:53:53.340 --> 05:53:55.340
shouldn't show flesh or what

05:53:55.340 --> 05:53:57.340
vtuber having fun, everyone having fun

05:53:57.340 --> 05:53:59.340
vtuber not having fun, no one having fun

05:53:59.340 --> 05:54:01.340
my heart is beating so fast

05:54:01.340 --> 05:54:03.340
I'm gonna pass it

05:54:03.340 --> 05:54:05.340
maybe

05:54:05.340 --> 05:54:07.340
dragon

05:54:07.340 --> 05:54:09.340
dragon

05:54:09.340 --> 05:54:11.340
dragon

05:54:11.340 --> 05:54:13.340
is this poison source

05:54:13.340 --> 05:54:15.340
that goes away

05:54:15.340 --> 05:54:17.340
or

05:54:17.340 --> 05:54:19.340
going away

05:54:19.340 --> 05:54:21.340
infinite plumage

05:54:21.340 --> 05:54:23.340
honestly

05:54:23.340 --> 05:54:25.340
we need the evidence

05:54:25.340 --> 05:54:27.340
oh you guys are comfortable with it

05:54:27.340 --> 05:54:29.340
I'm uncomfortable with it

05:54:29.340 --> 05:54:31.340
yeah it doesn't make sense

05:54:31.340 --> 05:54:33.340
can you show us

05:54:33.340 --> 05:54:35.340
well I wanted to do

05:54:35.340 --> 05:54:37.340
a slow clap

05:54:37.340 --> 05:54:39.340
like slow motion clapping

05:54:39.340 --> 05:54:41.340
so people can comprehend

05:54:41.340 --> 05:54:43.340
how I made that ASMR

05:54:43.340 --> 05:54:45.340
did we just run past

05:54:45.340 --> 05:54:47.340
I think we may have to run past, you know that

05:54:47.340 --> 05:54:49.340
okay I'm just gonna run past, I'm brave

05:54:49.340 --> 05:54:51.340
I'm so brave I'm running fast

05:54:53.340 --> 05:54:55.340
I might need to sleep but I need to

05:54:55.340 --> 05:54:57.340
do more, oh you need to be careful though

05:54:57.340 --> 05:54:59.340
neutralizing

05:54:59.340 --> 05:55:01.340
bulbouses

05:55:01.340 --> 05:55:03.340
did you just give me your bulbouses

05:55:05.340 --> 05:55:07.340
okay we're just gonna run past

05:55:07.340 --> 05:55:09.340
holy crap look how many there is

05:55:09.340 --> 05:55:11.340
that's so much

05:55:15.340 --> 05:55:17.340
actually speaking of dolls

05:55:17.340 --> 05:55:19.340
because Ranny's a doll

05:55:19.340 --> 05:55:21.340
you know how I cannae get away from like

05:55:21.340 --> 05:55:23.340
creepy doll vtuber's and that

05:55:23.340 --> 05:55:25.340
you know why I also like them

05:55:25.340 --> 05:55:27.340
do you know what the appeal could be

05:55:27.340 --> 05:55:29.340
the appeal could be

05:55:29.340 --> 05:55:31.340
free use

05:55:33.340 --> 05:55:35.340
like in theory they could be inactive

05:55:35.340 --> 05:55:37.340
in like a plot

05:55:37.340 --> 05:55:39.340
I don't know how to

05:55:39.340 --> 05:55:41.340
like in my head I've not thought it out it just came on my mind right now

05:55:41.340 --> 05:55:43.340
but like you can like play with your doll type thing

05:55:43.340 --> 05:55:45.340
like free use

05:55:45.340 --> 05:55:47.340
like that's another thing

05:55:47.340 --> 05:55:49.340
anyway that's just me

05:55:51.340 --> 05:55:53.340
I got it I got it

05:55:53.340 --> 05:55:55.340
wow we need to keep moving this forza

05:55:55.340 --> 05:55:57.340
everywhere they're taking over

05:55:57.340 --> 05:55:59.340
they gave you a poison cure

05:55:59.340 --> 05:56:01.340
oh in case you get poisoned

05:56:01.340 --> 05:56:03.340
show gimley

05:56:03.340 --> 05:56:05.340
what about Vigo

05:56:05.340 --> 05:56:07.340
you don't like the appeal of Vigo

05:56:07.340 --> 05:56:09.340
baby boy is a

05:56:09.340 --> 05:56:11.340
he's been a very

05:56:11.340 --> 05:56:13.340
interesting boy

05:56:13.340 --> 05:56:15.340
recently

05:56:15.340 --> 05:56:17.340
so when my hair

05:56:17.340 --> 05:56:19.340
is wet

05:56:19.340 --> 05:56:21.340
he goes crazy

05:56:21.340 --> 05:56:23.340
pushing into my head

05:56:23.340 --> 05:56:25.340
and it's really sore

05:56:25.340 --> 05:56:27.340
oh I got barbaric roar

05:56:27.340 --> 05:56:29.340
my flanks

05:56:31.340 --> 05:56:33.340
Vigo is quiet he is a quiet boy

05:56:33.340 --> 05:56:35.340
he's not very gimley

05:56:35.340 --> 05:56:37.340
I don't know if it's because he's part munchkin

05:56:37.340 --> 05:56:39.340
like I don't know how healthy munchkin cats are

05:56:41.340 --> 05:56:43.340
I should actually probably do my research a bit more

05:56:43.340 --> 05:56:45.340
he seems to be

05:56:45.340 --> 05:56:47.340
are we oh yeah you flake

05:56:47.340 --> 05:56:49.340
I was here 10

05:56:49.340 --> 05:56:51.340
hours ago you're so slow

05:56:51.340 --> 05:56:53.340
slow folks yeah yeah

05:56:53.340 --> 05:56:55.340
um

05:56:57.340 --> 05:56:59.340
I think the tag is something

05:56:59.340 --> 05:57:01.340
emotionless yes yes

05:57:01.340 --> 05:57:03.340
that could also be another angle of adult

05:57:03.340 --> 05:57:05.340
each of her

05:57:05.340 --> 05:57:07.340
oh can you not progress

05:57:07.340 --> 05:57:09.340
oh no none of us

05:57:09.340 --> 05:57:11.340
can progress

05:57:11.340 --> 05:57:13.340
oh no this can't be

05:57:13.340 --> 05:57:15.340
this can't be my refunds

05:57:15.340 --> 05:57:17.340

05:57:17.340 --> 05:57:19.340
I can't go in we can't progress

05:57:19.340 --> 05:57:21.340
the helmet has jiggle

05:57:21.340 --> 05:57:23.340
jiggle jiggle jiggle

05:57:25.340 --> 05:57:27.340
yeah thankfully

05:57:27.340 --> 05:57:29.340
he's a half breed munchkin

05:57:29.340 --> 05:57:31.340
I'm very happy to say that

05:57:31.340 --> 05:57:33.340
so he's not a full munchkin at all

05:57:33.340 --> 05:57:35.340
he has tabby gene tabby cat gene

05:57:35.340 --> 05:57:37.340
domination which I'm very freaking happy

05:57:37.340 --> 05:57:39.340
about

05:57:39.340 --> 05:57:41.340
his legs are just slightly smaller

05:57:41.340 --> 05:57:43.340
but he looks healthy

05:57:43.340 --> 05:57:45.340
I don't know if he just seems more tired

05:57:45.340 --> 05:57:47.340
and

05:57:47.340 --> 05:57:49.340
you flake

05:57:49.340 --> 05:57:51.340
I have to

05:57:51.340 --> 05:57:53.340
I have to go on my own

05:57:53.340 --> 05:57:55.340
but it's okay

05:57:59.340 --> 05:58:01.340
what they don't know

05:58:03.340 --> 05:58:05.340
this is now a stealth mission

05:58:05.340 --> 05:58:07.340
when I can't call you in

05:58:07.340 --> 05:58:09.340
okay it's a stealth mission

05:58:09.340 --> 05:58:11.340
we do not want to get caught

05:58:11.340 --> 05:58:13.340
we do not want to enter any unnecessary

05:58:13.340 --> 05:58:15.340
fight

05:58:15.340 --> 05:58:17.340
we just need the mark of grave

05:58:19.340 --> 05:58:21.340
oh my god no

05:58:21.340 --> 05:58:23.340

this room has jumpscare gargoyles

05:58:25.340 --> 05:58:27.340
oh my god my memory just saved me

05:58:27.340 --> 05:58:29.340
I can see them now

05:58:31.340 --> 05:58:33.340

06:02:01.340 --> 06:02:03.340
do we go up here

06:02:03.340 --> 06:02:05.340
I don't want to go back in that cavern

06:02:05.340 --> 06:02:07.340
I am going to be honest I don't actually want to go back in there

06:02:09.340 --> 06:02:11.340
for knowledge you guys

06:02:13.340 --> 06:02:15.340
I forgot to sit down

06:02:15.340 --> 06:02:17.340
that guy was chasing me the entire time

06:02:17.340 --> 06:02:19.340
they have very big aggro

06:02:19.340 --> 06:02:21.340
like they

06:02:21.340 --> 06:02:23.340
whenever I play my old games I like them

06:02:23.340 --> 06:02:25.340
cause I can always be like

06:02:25.340 --> 06:02:27.340
oh har har

06:02:27.340 --> 06:02:29.340

06:02:31.340 --> 06:02:33.340
I am like oh har har you're not coded to be over here

oh wait don't I have a few runes on my

06:02:49.340 --> 06:02:51.340
persons

06:02:53.340 --> 06:02:55.340
I wouldn't call for you

06:02:55.340 --> 06:02:57.340

06:02:57.340 --> 06:02:59.340
one is going down the other is going up

06:02:59.340 --> 06:03:01.340

06:03:01.340 --> 06:03:03.340

06:03:05.340 --> 06:03:07.340

06:03:23.340 --> 06:03:25.340
that's fantastic how do you guys even remember

06:03:25.340 --> 06:03:27.340
I am so patient

06:03:27.340 --> 06:03:29.340
you see that I almost perished off the side of the map

06:03:29.340 --> 06:03:31.340
cause I am a dum dum

06:03:31.340 --> 06:03:33.340
yeah tether games are so nice

06:03:33.340 --> 06:03:35.340

you can't get me

06:03:39.340 --> 06:03:41.340
you can't get me

06:03:41.340 --> 06:03:43.340
you just gave reeflings

06:03:43.340 --> 06:03:45.340
so many heart attacks I am so sorry

06:03:45.340 --> 06:03:47.340
if it makes you feel any better

06:03:47.340 --> 06:03:49.340
I had a heart attack

06:03:51.340 --> 06:03:53.340
we got smithing stone level 4

06:03:53.340 --> 06:03:55.340
it is clean

06:03:55.340 --> 06:03:57.340
BRB have to clean the litter

06:03:57.340 --> 06:03:59.340
and feed the kitty

06:03:59.340 --> 06:04:01.340
at fed

06:04:01.340 --> 06:04:03.340
people

06:04:03.340 --> 06:04:05.340
and weakens

06:04:05.340 --> 06:04:07.340
when I made my cup of tea I gave them a wee licky lick

06:04:07.340 --> 06:04:09.340
cause they are we precious

06:04:09.340 --> 06:04:11.340
adorable things

06:04:11.340 --> 06:04:13.340
oh there is another one

06:04:13.340 --> 06:04:15.340
ooh a smithing stone

06:04:15.340 --> 06:04:17.340
ooh a smithing stone

06:04:17.340 --> 06:04:19.340
ooh another one

06:04:19.340 --> 06:04:21.340
holy crap

06:04:21.340 --> 06:04:23.340
I am killing it with the magic

06:04:25.340 --> 06:04:27.340
and by killing it I mean

06:04:27.340 --> 06:04:29.340
absolutely why am I taking poison damage

06:04:31.340 --> 06:04:33.340
huh

06:04:33.340 --> 06:04:35.340
those bats do poison damage

06:04:35.340 --> 06:04:37.340
how strange

06:04:37.340 --> 06:04:39.340
I would not have put them for that

06:04:41.340 --> 06:04:43.340
it's called having over 500 arrows in the game

06:04:43.340 --> 06:04:45.340
at the point you just know where everything is

06:04:45.340 --> 06:04:47.340
aww I am glad you can find a game

06:04:47.340 --> 06:04:49.340
that you enjoy so much like that

06:04:49.340 --> 06:04:51.340
I am kind of like that with Isaac

06:04:51.340 --> 06:04:53.340
but I have to admit

06:04:53.340 --> 06:04:55.340
Beltro stole my heart yesterday

06:04:55.340 --> 06:04:57.340
I am

06:04:57.340 --> 06:04:59.340
careful careful

06:05:01.340 --> 06:05:03.340
I am very interested to play Beltro again

06:05:03.340 --> 06:05:05.340
it won't be until July

06:05:05.340 --> 06:05:07.340
my dad

06:05:07.340 --> 06:05:09.340
he told me what

06:05:09.340 --> 06:05:11.340
when he is coming over and when he is going

06:05:11.340 --> 06:05:13.340
it is actually a lot longer

06:05:13.340 --> 06:05:15.340
it is like just shy of me

06:05:19.340 --> 06:05:21.340
behold precious item

06:05:21.340 --> 06:05:23.340
oh you are right sorry

06:05:23.340 --> 06:05:25.340
you are singing sorry I am going to distract you by the singing

06:05:29.340 --> 06:05:31.340
I am actually open to Zura

06:05:31.340 --> 06:05:33.340
I might entertain some more song covers

06:05:33.340 --> 06:05:35.340
her voice is very unique

06:05:35.340 --> 06:05:37.340
it sounds bloody good

06:05:37.340 --> 06:05:39.340
obviously I made everyone do a meme song

06:05:39.340 --> 06:05:41.340
but I would like to see her try

06:05:41.340 --> 06:05:43.340
something of a different category

06:05:43.340 --> 06:05:45.340
that I really need

06:05:47.340 --> 06:05:49.340
yeah

06:05:49.340 --> 06:05:51.340
she definitely has a thing for it

06:05:51.340 --> 06:05:53.340
I think she just

06:05:53.340 --> 06:05:55.340
I don't know what I should ask her to sing

06:05:55.340 --> 06:05:57.340
is my only question

06:05:57.340 --> 06:05:59.340
I am not sure she knows

06:05:59.340 --> 06:06:01.340
either because she is new to it

06:06:01.340 --> 06:06:03.340
as far as I am aware she didn't do song covers

06:06:03.340 --> 06:06:05.340
or anything like that

06:06:05.340 --> 06:06:07.340
that first song is boobs in the thumbnail

06:06:07.340 --> 06:06:09.340
was her first ever song cover

06:06:09.340 --> 06:06:11.340
I am just trying to think what kind of songs

06:06:11.340 --> 06:06:13.340
would either get popular

06:06:13.340 --> 06:06:15.340
like Emmie

06:06:15.340 --> 06:06:17.340
has been

06:06:17.340 --> 06:06:19.340
I am so sorry

06:06:19.340 --> 06:06:21.340
Radio Refling

06:06:21.340 --> 06:06:23.340
Emmie has been really receptive

06:06:23.340 --> 06:06:25.340
I wanted to try a few things with her

06:06:25.340 --> 06:06:27.340
as far as I am aware

06:06:27.340 --> 06:06:29.340
the other

06:06:29.340 --> 06:06:31.340
Mercy might want to do a song cover

06:06:33.340 --> 06:06:35.340
again

06:06:35.340 --> 06:06:37.340
I am doing that

06:06:37.340 --> 06:06:39.340
we are going to do a little meme

06:06:39.340 --> 06:06:41.340
I am going to ask them

06:06:41.340 --> 06:06:43.340
hey what do you want to do

06:06:43.340 --> 06:06:45.340
oh no

06:06:45.340 --> 06:06:47.340
I think I am going to have to start upgrading my weapons

06:06:47.340 --> 06:06:49.340
I am going to be honest

06:06:49.340 --> 06:06:51.340
oh no

06:06:51.340 --> 06:06:53.340
this is a dragon

06:06:53.340 --> 06:06:55.340
I thought it was going to be the crystal guys

06:06:55.340 --> 06:06:57.340
because we were just in a mine

06:06:57.340 --> 06:06:59.340
I don't know if this is going to be easy

06:06:59.340 --> 06:07:01.340
or hard

06:07:01.340 --> 06:07:03.340
Joel clapping with no heart

06:07:03.340 --> 06:07:05.340
seriously

06:07:05.340 --> 06:07:07.340
I am going to ask them

06:07:07.340 --> 06:07:09.340
what do you want to achieve

06:07:09.340 --> 06:07:11.340
what do you want to do

06:07:11.340 --> 06:07:13.340

06:07:15.340 --> 06:07:17.340

I don't know if I am supposed to attack

06:07:19.340 --> 06:07:21.340
I missed

06:07:21.340 --> 06:07:23.340

06:07:35.340 --> 06:07:37.340
oh I got an achievement for that

06:07:37.340 --> 06:07:39.340
I didn't even do anything

06:07:39.340 --> 06:07:41.340
and I got an achievement

06:07:41.340 --> 06:07:43.340

06:07:43.340 --> 06:07:45.340
oh no that has to be on my own again

06:07:45.340 --> 06:07:47.340

are pretty easy

06:08:37.340 --> 06:08:39.340

at the foot of the earth tree

06:10:05.340 --> 06:10:07.340
where mother gave me my purpose

06:10:09.340 --> 06:10:11.340
everything is lost to me

06:10:11.340 --> 06:10:13.340
I

06:10:13.340 --> 06:10:15.340
have to ascertain for myself

06:10:15.340 --> 06:10:17.340
the reason for which I live

06:10:17.340 --> 06:10:19.340

he uses anti-gravitable magic

06:14:29.340 --> 06:14:31.340

06:14:39.340 --> 06:14:41.340

06:22:57.340 --> 06:22:59.340

06:22:59.340 --> 06:23:01.340

06:23:17.340 --> 06:23:19.340
by doing that

06:23:19.340 --> 06:23:21.340
is that Rani doing that

06:23:25.340 --> 06:23:27.340

06:23:31.340 --> 06:23:33.340
he was holding

06:23:33.340 --> 06:23:35.340
all the stars in place

06:23:35.340 --> 06:23:37.340
at a sheer force of will

06:23:45.340 --> 06:23:47.340
he was holding the stars in place

06:23:47.340 --> 06:23:49.340
so now that he's dead the stars can move

06:23:49.340 --> 06:23:51.340

06:24:21.340 --> 06:24:23.340

06:24:55.340 --> 06:24:57.340
I need to get out of this area

06:24:57.340 --> 06:24:59.340

it is right here

06:25:11.340 --> 06:25:13.340

right before her eyes

06:26:13.340 --> 06:26:15.340
I can't fathom how radhan was holding back

06:26:15.340 --> 06:26:17.340
something of that scale

06:26:17.340 --> 06:26:19.340
if ever I saw one

06:26:21.340 --> 06:26:23.340
he has admiration in his voice

06:26:23.340 --> 06:26:25.340

underneath the map

06:26:45.340 --> 06:26:47.340

should I level up before

06:27:49.340 --> 06:27:51.340
I assume you can weapon level

06:27:51.340 --> 06:27:53.340
I don't know would I need a generic

06:27:53.340 --> 06:27:55.340

there's getting ready to be mean to me

06:29:01.340 --> 06:29:03.340
upgrade your weapons and fluff

06:29:05.340 --> 06:29:07.340
normal smithing stones are 1 to 8

06:29:07.340 --> 06:29:09.340
you need 12 for each

06:29:09.340 --> 06:29:11.340
pair of weapons

06:29:13.340 --> 06:29:15.340

06:29:35.340 --> 06:29:37.340
do I level them up equally

06:29:37.340 --> 06:29:39.340
or just try and do one big

06:29:43.340 --> 06:29:45.340
just focus on one at a time

06:29:45.340 --> 06:29:47.340
okay

06:29:51.340 --> 06:29:53.340
okay additional items required

06:29:53.340 --> 06:29:55.340
I need smithing stones here

06:29:55.340 --> 06:29:57.340
uh I don't know who

06:29:57.340 --> 06:29:59.340
does any of that

06:29:59.340 --> 06:30:01.340
uh

06:30:01.340 --> 06:30:03.340
right

06:30:03.340 --> 06:30:05.340
someone said focus on getting

06:30:05.340 --> 06:30:07.340
seeds

06:30:07.340 --> 06:30:09.340
um

06:30:09.340 --> 06:30:11.340
if we want to get seeds

06:30:13.340 --> 06:30:15.340
I'm gonna pretend

06:30:15.340 --> 06:30:17.340
I don't know where to go

06:30:17.340 --> 06:30:19.340
there is a main

06:30:19.340 --> 06:30:21.340
and

06:30:21.340 --> 06:30:23.340
maybe we went to that main

06:30:23.340 --> 06:30:25.340
oh fuck it let's just go into the dlc

06:30:25.340 --> 06:30:27.340
if we get rolled

06:30:27.340 --> 06:30:29.340
we can always come back and like genuinely

06:30:29.340 --> 06:30:31.340
get stuff

06:30:33.340 --> 06:30:35.340
I assume we can come back

06:30:35.340 --> 06:30:37.340
the dlc isn't like a weird instance

06:30:37.340 --> 06:30:39.340
like you can never return to this area

06:30:39.340 --> 06:30:41.340
again type thing surely

06:30:43.340 --> 06:30:45.340
surely that's how it works

06:30:45.340 --> 06:30:47.340
yeah you can come back up there

06:30:49.340 --> 06:30:51.340
let's go let's see what happens

06:30:51.340 --> 06:30:53.340
touch head to the realm of shadows

06:31:13.340 --> 06:31:15.340
oh

06:31:23.340 --> 06:31:25.340
grave site clean

06:31:33.340 --> 06:31:35.340
the tree is dripping madness

06:31:39.340 --> 06:31:41.340
well well well reeflands

06:31:43.340 --> 06:31:45.340
well well well indeed

06:31:45.340 --> 06:31:47.340
just

06:31:47.340 --> 06:31:49.340
okay far we've gotten already

06:31:51.340 --> 06:31:53.340
okay we get invader in

06:31:53.340 --> 06:31:55.340
does that count invaders

06:31:55.340 --> 06:31:57.340
I don't know if I should have done that

06:32:01.340 --> 06:32:03.340
here we go

06:32:03.340 --> 06:32:05.340
uh

06:32:11.340 --> 06:32:13.340
where did the other creeps

06:32:13.340 --> 06:32:15.340
the game is so buggy

06:32:17.340 --> 06:32:19.340
gorgeous view incoming

06:32:21.340 --> 06:32:23.340
look what have we even got a man

06:32:23.340 --> 06:32:25.340
I don't know if you can go on that man

06:32:25.340 --> 06:32:27.340
but still looks good

06:32:27.340 --> 06:32:29.340
the tree looks good

06:32:29.340 --> 06:32:31.340
good

06:32:31.340 --> 06:32:33.340
oh there's like a few kind of temple

06:32:33.340 --> 06:32:35.340
things over there

06:32:35.340 --> 06:32:37.340
hi

06:32:37.340 --> 06:32:39.340
oh no

06:32:39.340 --> 06:32:41.340
because I did the invader

06:32:41.340 --> 06:32:43.340
it got rid of the freaking things

06:32:43.340 --> 06:32:45.340
I don't know why the game does all this stuff

06:32:45.340 --> 06:32:47.340
are you praying

06:32:47.340 --> 06:32:49.340
you want to

06:32:49.340 --> 06:32:51.340
oh your butt cheeks are heavy madame

06:32:51.340 --> 06:32:53.340
would you like us to hold them

06:32:53.340 --> 06:32:55.340
yes you may

06:32:55.340 --> 06:32:57.340
sorry

06:32:57.340 --> 06:32:59.340
for that

06:33:03.340 --> 06:33:05.340
wait why is it

06:33:11.340 --> 06:33:13.340
wait why is there another second weeping

06:33:13.340 --> 06:33:15.340
coming in

06:33:15.340 --> 06:33:17.340
I think it's like bugging out

06:33:17.340 --> 06:33:19.340
yes don't use a gorgeous movie

06:33:19.340 --> 06:33:21.340
oh shit

06:33:21.340 --> 06:33:23.340
he's still buff

06:33:23.340 --> 06:33:25.340
I think it may

06:33:25.340 --> 06:33:27.340
I'm not sure

06:33:27.340 --> 06:33:29.340
but

06:33:29.340 --> 06:33:31.340
we certainly seem to be having summoning issues

06:33:31.340 --> 06:33:33.340
but

06:33:33.340 --> 06:33:35.340
it's all we can do

06:33:35.340 --> 06:33:37.340
is it worth jewel wielding them by the way

06:33:37.340 --> 06:33:39.340
I don't know

06:33:39.340 --> 06:33:41.340
is it

06:33:41.340 --> 06:33:43.340
wow

06:33:43.340 --> 06:33:45.340
I mean I wouldn't want to

06:33:45.340 --> 06:33:47.340
be in the wrath of me

06:33:47.340 --> 06:33:49.340
do something like that

06:33:55.340 --> 06:33:57.340
with 99 strength

06:33:57.340 --> 06:33:59.340
yeah just spam attack

06:33:59.340 --> 06:34:01.340

06:34:53.340 --> 06:34:55.340
I don't know

06:34:59.340 --> 06:35:01.340
okay we can do it

06:35:01.340 --> 06:35:03.340
we'll do a bit of exploring and then

06:35:03.340 --> 06:35:05.340
I'm gonna get some proper food on my tummy

06:35:05.340 --> 06:35:07.340

06:35:07.340 --> 06:35:09.340

06:35:15.340 --> 06:35:17.340
new enemies

06:35:17.340 --> 06:35:19.340
new enemies I'm not familiar with

06:35:21.340 --> 06:35:23.340
oh my god did they take a hammer

06:35:23.340 --> 06:35:25.340
and wow look at his design

06:35:27.340 --> 06:35:29.340

06:35:29.340 --> 06:35:31.340
deer like when he's like straight ahead

06:35:31.340 --> 06:35:33.340

06:35:33.340 --> 06:35:35.340
holy shit we're getting ghouls

06:35:37.340 --> 06:35:39.340
careful invader refling

06:35:43.340 --> 06:35:45.340
well these

06:35:45.340 --> 06:35:47.340
enemies aren't kidding around

06:35:47.340 --> 06:35:49.340
holy crap

06:35:49.340 --> 06:35:51.340
I'm sorry refling

06:35:53.340 --> 06:35:55.340
do you know where to go

06:35:57.340 --> 06:35:59.340
are we all just guessing here

06:35:59.340 --> 06:36:01.340
oh there's the map

06:36:01.340 --> 06:36:03.340
oh there's like an actual town

06:36:03.340 --> 06:36:05.340
you never see that

06:36:07.340 --> 06:36:09.340
wow

06:36:11.340 --> 06:36:13.340
imagine if we had a refling village

06:36:13.340 --> 06:36:15.340
shit

06:36:17.340 --> 06:36:19.340
what would we do in a refling village

06:36:19.340 --> 06:36:21.340
we'd have a tavern

06:36:21.340 --> 06:36:23.340
go this way

06:36:23.340 --> 06:36:25.340
hello mister

06:36:25.340 --> 06:36:27.340
are you okay

06:36:27.340 --> 06:36:29.340
everyone burnt a cinders

06:36:29.340 --> 06:36:31.340
burned away

06:36:31.340 --> 06:36:33.340
put to the touch

06:36:33.340 --> 06:36:35.340
put to the torch by mesmer and his lot

06:36:35.340 --> 06:36:37.340
what did we do to deserve such a fate

06:36:37.340 --> 06:36:39.340
we merely lived our lives

06:36:39.340 --> 06:36:41.340
we lived in peace

06:36:41.340 --> 06:36:43.340
oh no this whole place burned

06:36:43.340 --> 06:36:45.340
are these enemies

06:36:45.340 --> 06:36:47.340
oh they are

06:36:47.340 --> 06:36:49.340
what did they do

06:36:49.340 --> 06:36:51.340
did they just fight

06:36:53.340 --> 06:36:55.340
why are you aggressive

06:36:55.340 --> 06:36:57.340
don't be aggressive

06:36:59.340 --> 06:37:01.340
fun fact a big theme in this DLC

06:37:01.340 --> 06:37:03.340
is rebirth and that

06:37:03.340 --> 06:37:05.340
and that enemy you killed and it's perfect

06:37:05.340 --> 06:37:07.340
some weapon when you view it from the front

06:37:07.340 --> 06:37:09.340
looks like it's the structure of a woman

06:37:09.340 --> 06:37:11.340
oh

06:37:11.340 --> 06:37:13.340
I love a bit of fanny

06:37:13.340 --> 06:37:15.340
inspiration as well

06:37:15.340 --> 06:37:17.340
not bad

06:37:19.340 --> 06:37:21.340
I'm sorry I don't know why

06:37:21.340 --> 06:37:23.340
I thought that was going to be funnier

06:37:23.340 --> 06:37:25.340
if I said that out loud but that wasn't funny

06:37:25.340 --> 06:37:27.340
that was just weird

06:37:27.340 --> 06:37:29.340
I'm sorry I delivered that really bizarrely

06:37:29.340 --> 06:37:31.340
it was supposed to be a joke

06:37:31.340 --> 06:37:33.340
but I think my voice was a bit

06:37:33.340 --> 06:37:35.340
too monotone to explain

06:37:35.340 --> 06:37:37.340
that I was joking during that

06:37:37.340 --> 06:37:39.340
I'm sorry

06:37:47.340 --> 06:37:49.340
that was good

06:37:49.340 --> 06:37:51.340
where do we

06:37:51.340 --> 06:37:53.340
no one knows where it goes

06:37:57.340 --> 06:37:59.340
something's supposed to happen

06:37:59.340 --> 06:38:01.340
if we're all literally exploring

06:38:01.340 --> 06:38:03.340
oh no you're going over here

06:38:03.340 --> 06:38:05.340
right we have a torch

06:38:05.340 --> 06:38:07.340
that means you actually know where you're going

06:38:07.340 --> 06:38:09.340
we'll do that

06:38:11.340 --> 06:38:13.340
I'm fricking too short

06:38:15.340 --> 06:38:17.340
I'm too small I can't reach

06:38:21.340 --> 06:38:23.340
wow

06:38:23.340 --> 06:38:25.340
like robes

06:38:25.340 --> 06:38:27.340
can I climb the robes

06:38:29.340 --> 06:38:31.340
kind of

06:38:31.340 --> 06:38:33.340
I'm not going the wrong way

06:38:33.340 --> 06:38:35.340
I'm getting distracted

06:38:35.340 --> 06:38:37.340
I've just never been here before

06:38:39.340 --> 06:38:41.340
okay follow the rea

06:38:41.340 --> 06:38:43.340
follow the torch if you have a torch

06:38:43.340 --> 06:38:45.340
I know it means you know where to go

06:38:45.340 --> 06:38:47.340
if none of us have a torch

06:38:47.340 --> 06:38:49.340
then it means we're just sending it

06:38:49.340 --> 06:38:51.340
okay

06:38:51.340 --> 06:38:53.340
I vote for the clueless squid to leave

06:38:53.340 --> 06:38:55.340
well the first time I played this game

06:38:55.340 --> 06:38:57.340
I ended up wandering in a kaolin

06:38:57.340 --> 06:38:59.340
it felt like part of the section

06:38:59.340 --> 06:39:01.340
you're fricking mad

06:39:01.340 --> 06:39:03.340
time

06:39:03.340 --> 06:39:05.340
I got not resist

06:39:15.340 --> 06:39:17.340
okay a little bit of parkour in the town

06:39:17.340 --> 06:39:19.340
don't mind

06:39:19.340 --> 06:39:21.340
I love what you've done with this place

06:39:21.340 --> 06:39:23.340
honestly none of you has told me you were stone masons

06:39:23.340 --> 06:39:25.340
but look at this architecture

06:39:25.340 --> 06:39:27.340
I mean look at the

06:39:27.340 --> 06:39:29.340
love and the detail that's been put into this

06:39:29.340 --> 06:39:31.340
what's happening

06:39:31.340 --> 06:39:33.340
you guys really don't give yourself enough credit

06:39:33.340 --> 06:39:35.340
for how much you do

06:39:35.340 --> 06:39:37.340
I mean look at all the detail

06:39:37.340 --> 06:39:39.340
the words

06:39:41.340 --> 06:39:43.340
go inside

06:39:43.340 --> 06:39:45.340
say no more open human

06:39:47.340 --> 06:39:49.340

06:39:51.340 --> 06:39:53.340
ooh item

06:39:53.340 --> 06:39:55.340
what is inside the treasure chest

06:39:55.340 --> 06:39:57.340
a blade of mercy

06:39:57.340 --> 06:39:59.340
I didn't realize she was in the video game

06:40:01.340 --> 06:40:03.340
let's just check it out just because we can

06:40:03.340 --> 06:40:05.340
it's an all weapon

06:40:07.340 --> 06:40:09.340
am I going crazy

06:40:11.340 --> 06:40:13.340
I saw that you're a fricking

06:40:13.340 --> 06:40:15.340
pulp behind me wait am I going crazy

06:40:15.340 --> 06:40:17.340
is it not like an actual weapon

06:40:17.340 --> 06:40:19.340
I just wanted to check it out

06:40:19.340 --> 06:40:21.340
oh it's a talisman my pardon

06:40:23.340 --> 06:40:25.340
raises attack power

06:40:25.340 --> 06:40:27.340
after each critical hit

06:40:27.340 --> 06:40:29.340
but it would put me on heavy load

06:40:29.340 --> 06:40:31.340
I need this talisman

06:40:31.340 --> 06:40:33.340

06:40:35.340 --> 06:40:37.340
a critical hit

06:40:37.340 --> 06:40:39.340
I don't really hit criticals

06:40:39.340 --> 06:40:41.340
do I

06:40:41.340 --> 06:40:43.340
I'll just leave the things we are

I do a lot of jump attack

06:40:45.340 --> 06:40:47.340
oh my god

06:40:47.340 --> 06:40:49.340

06:40:49.340 --> 06:40:51.340
from violers gen 1 indulge

06:40:51.340 --> 06:40:53.340
okay I now have talisman

06:40:55.340 --> 06:40:57.340
you will follow them

06:40:59.340 --> 06:41:01.340
did you make me stagger there

06:41:01.340 --> 06:41:03.340
I think you staggered me

06:41:03.340 --> 06:41:05.340
oh no

06:41:05.340 --> 06:41:07.340
okay I'm running and jumping

06:41:07.340 --> 06:41:09.340
I don't trust myself

06:41:11.340 --> 06:41:13.340
another replay

06:41:19.340 --> 06:41:21.340
wait down

06:41:21.340 --> 06:41:23.340
I'm looking at you

06:41:23.340 --> 06:41:25.340
I'm looking at you

06:41:25.340 --> 06:41:27.340
I've got red flesh mushroom

06:41:27.340 --> 06:41:29.340
if you have the torch

06:41:29.340 --> 06:41:31.340
you're leading the way

06:41:31.340 --> 06:41:33.340
because I don't know where the heck I'm going

06:41:35.340 --> 06:41:37.340
mercy's whole thing is

06:41:37.340 --> 06:41:39.340
bleak

06:41:39.340 --> 06:41:41.340
if she was karam

06:41:41.340 --> 06:41:43.340
you know actually

06:41:43.340 --> 06:41:45.340
because of her name change

06:41:45.340 --> 06:41:47.340
her custom

06:41:47.340 --> 06:41:49.340
toggle

06:41:49.340 --> 06:41:51.340
her unique thing

06:41:51.340 --> 06:41:53.340
like she can put her hands on her face

06:41:53.340 --> 06:41:55.340
oh look at that

06:41:55.340 --> 06:41:57.340
I don't want to go against it

06:41:57.340 --> 06:41:59.340
but look at it though

06:42:03.340 --> 06:42:05.340
oh my god

06:42:13.340 --> 06:42:15.340
hope it doesn't have a big aoe

06:42:15.340 --> 06:42:17.340
excuse me mr. sheep

06:42:17.340 --> 06:42:19.340
face it

06:42:19.340 --> 06:42:21.340
no I'm just scared

06:42:21.340 --> 06:42:23.340
oh my

06:42:23.340 --> 06:42:25.340
okay

06:42:27.340 --> 06:42:29.340
we're learning the new enemies

06:42:29.340 --> 06:42:31.340
we're getting familiar

06:42:31.340 --> 06:42:33.340
got a lot of enemies

06:42:35.340 --> 06:42:37.340
I might need to drop a loaf of bread

06:42:37.340 --> 06:42:39.340
I'm not joking

06:42:39.340 --> 06:42:41.340
my tummy

06:42:41.340 --> 06:42:43.340
I should have started stealing

06:42:43.340 --> 06:42:45.340
a bit of loaf of bread

06:42:45.340 --> 06:42:47.340
I'm feeling heavy

06:42:47.340 --> 06:42:49.340
it's up to being killed by the witch

06:42:51.340 --> 06:42:53.340
the thing is all aoe

06:42:53.340 --> 06:42:55.340
honestly

06:42:59.340 --> 06:43:01.340
oh these are where the wiggly worms are

06:43:01.340 --> 06:43:03.340
that's on the menu

06:43:05.340 --> 06:43:07.340
okay

06:43:11.340 --> 06:43:13.340
bite it anyway

06:43:13.340 --> 06:43:15.340
even if it's friendly

06:43:15.340 --> 06:43:17.340
nothing is friendly in this game

06:43:17.340 --> 06:43:19.340
are you praying to the wiggly worm

06:43:19.340 --> 06:43:21.340
oh wiggly worm

06:43:21.340 --> 06:43:23.340
oh my god look at it

06:43:23.340 --> 06:43:25.340
oh no

06:43:25.340 --> 06:43:27.340
it's face

06:43:27.340 --> 06:43:29.340
oh

06:43:29.340 --> 06:43:31.340
it was going so well

06:43:31.340 --> 06:43:33.340
for your design

06:43:33.340 --> 06:43:35.340
that's unfortunate

06:43:35.340 --> 06:43:37.340
that face is unfortunate

06:43:37.340 --> 06:43:39.340
the cuteness factor

06:43:39.340 --> 06:43:41.340
may not have gone down after that

06:43:41.340 --> 06:43:43.340
aoe

06:43:43.340 --> 06:43:45.340
a little thingy

06:43:45.340 --> 06:43:47.340
sorry I'm getting distracted

06:43:49.340 --> 06:43:51.340
looks like a fight would occur here

06:43:51.340 --> 06:43:53.340
yep there's definitely a fight

06:43:53.340 --> 06:43:55.340
because look at this

06:43:55.340 --> 06:43:57.340
statues and stuff

06:43:57.340 --> 06:43:59.340
well

06:44:01.340 --> 06:44:03.340
oh we're getting blessed up

06:44:03.340 --> 06:44:05.340
okay

06:44:05.340 --> 06:44:07.340
okay

06:44:07.340 --> 06:44:09.340
it's a fight in the DLC

06:44:09.340 --> 06:44:11.340
our first proper fight

06:44:11.340 --> 06:44:13.340
let's see what happens

06:44:13.340 --> 06:44:15.340
it's a crypt

06:44:15.340 --> 06:44:17.340
it's a crypt

06:44:17.340 --> 06:44:19.340
we've done crypts before

06:44:19.340 --> 06:44:21.340
it's just a knight

06:44:23.340 --> 06:44:25.340
I'm pretty sure crossbow bolts

06:44:25.340 --> 06:44:27.340
are only supposed to have one

06:44:27.340 --> 06:44:29.340
thing on them

06:44:29.340 --> 06:44:31.340
oh my god for a knight

06:44:31.340 --> 06:44:33.340
he is so quick

06:44:37.340 --> 06:44:39.340
he

06:44:43.340 --> 06:44:45.340
I don't even get stuck

06:44:53.340 --> 06:44:55.340
oh my god

06:44:55.340 --> 06:44:57.340
did you see that

06:45:01.340 --> 06:45:03.340
I need to

06:45:03.340 --> 06:45:05.340
no no no

06:45:07.340 --> 06:45:09.340
no don't do it

06:45:17.340 --> 06:45:19.340
fuck you

06:45:19.340 --> 06:45:21.340
I can kill him on reekland

06:45:21.340 --> 06:45:23.340
and you get out of the way

06:45:23.340 --> 06:45:25.340
sorry I'm out of stamina

06:45:25.340 --> 06:45:27.340
I'm trying to manage my stamina

06:45:27.340 --> 06:45:29.340
but I'm not that smart

06:45:29.340 --> 06:45:31.340
stop it

06:45:31.340 --> 06:45:33.340
oh my god

06:45:33.340 --> 06:45:35.340
I'm out of stamina again

06:45:35.340 --> 06:45:37.340
sorry

06:45:37.340 --> 06:45:39.340
no leave him alone

06:45:49.340 --> 06:45:51.340
ah

06:45:51.340 --> 06:45:53.340
he is so much health strong

06:45:53.340 --> 06:45:55.340
I only upgraded them a little bit

06:45:55.340 --> 06:45:57.340
I think we might have to upgrade them

06:45:59.340 --> 06:46:01.340
how about I let you guys finish him

06:46:01.340 --> 06:46:03.340
off and then I'll go drop a loaf of bread

06:46:03.340 --> 06:46:05.340
and get some snacks

06:46:05.340 --> 06:46:07.340
does that sound like a plan?

06:46:09.340 --> 06:46:11.340
I'll let the reekland finish him

06:46:11.340 --> 06:46:13.340
off and then I'll go drop a loaf of bread

06:46:13.340 --> 06:46:15.340
ok

06:46:15.340 --> 06:46:17.340
surely this is gonna work

06:46:17.340 --> 06:46:19.340
surely

06:46:19.340 --> 06:46:21.340
I don't even know if I need to put you guys under boss fights

06:46:21.340 --> 06:46:23.340
wait who we got

06:46:23.340 --> 06:46:25.340
I could hear that

06:46:25.340 --> 06:46:27.340
I knew I heard that

06:46:27.340 --> 06:46:29.340
boss fights don't count

06:46:31.340 --> 06:46:33.340
uh

06:46:33.340 --> 06:46:35.340
what are you are you melee

06:46:35.340 --> 06:46:37.340
you're big melee

06:46:37.340 --> 06:46:39.340
I don't know

06:46:39.340 --> 06:46:41.340
hmm

06:46:41.340 --> 06:46:43.340
hmm

06:46:43.340 --> 06:46:45.340
the gear diff is pretty hard the DLC is not

06:46:45.340 --> 06:46:47.340
on top of the fact your weapons need upgrades

06:46:47.340 --> 06:46:49.340
there's even more upgrade nonsense which is

06:46:49.340 --> 06:46:51.340
unique to this DLC alone

06:46:51.340 --> 06:46:53.340
oh see another one

06:46:53.340 --> 06:46:55.340
in come in come

06:46:55.340 --> 06:46:57.340
boss fighters in come

06:46:57.340 --> 06:46:59.340
I will be holding back

06:46:59.340 --> 06:47:01.340
because I am

06:47:01.340 --> 06:47:03.340
shy so

06:47:03.340 --> 06:47:05.340
as much as this outfit is absolutely

06:47:05.340 --> 06:47:07.340
stunning and I actually have to put on some armor

06:47:07.340 --> 06:47:09.340
don't worry mommy

06:47:09.340 --> 06:47:11.340
take some sleep

06:47:11.340 --> 06:47:13.340
hmm

06:47:15.340 --> 06:47:17.340
ok not to

06:47:17.340 --> 06:47:19.340
not to make the situation

06:47:19.340 --> 06:47:21.340
critical or anything

06:47:21.340 --> 06:47:23.340
if we fail this one I still

06:47:23.340 --> 06:47:25.340
might have to go drop a loaf of bread

06:47:25.340 --> 06:47:27.340
I'm not saying the situation is critical

06:47:27.340 --> 06:47:29.340
but it's not good right now it's not good

06:47:29.340 --> 06:47:31.340
it's not good

06:47:31.340 --> 06:47:33.340
King Kong's fingers pushing ok

06:47:33.340 --> 06:47:35.340
right let's go let's go let's get this

06:47:35.340 --> 06:47:37.340
done

06:47:37.340 --> 06:47:39.340
oh my my my

06:47:39.340 --> 06:47:41.340
I'm just gonna hide in the corner

06:47:41.340 --> 06:47:43.340
and he can shoot at me

06:47:49.340 --> 06:47:51.340
ok come on refling

06:47:51.340 --> 06:47:53.340
we got two melee he has so much

06:47:53.340 --> 06:47:55.340
like

06:47:55.340 --> 06:47:57.340
oh ok ok we have a crit

06:47:57.340 --> 06:47:59.340
we have a crit fantastic

06:47:59.340 --> 06:48:01.340
oh we have like sword art

06:48:01.340 --> 06:48:03.340
blood dancing

06:48:03.340 --> 06:48:05.340
sword blood dancing

06:48:05.340 --> 06:48:07.340
but magic being cast

06:48:07.340 --> 06:48:09.340
sometimes missing

06:48:09.340 --> 06:48:11.340
it's not possible to always hit the

06:48:11.340 --> 06:48:13.340
avocado

06:48:13.340 --> 06:48:15.340
abracadabra

06:48:19.340 --> 06:48:21.340
oh no one refling might be down

06:48:21.340 --> 06:48:23.340
possibly the aggro swaps

06:48:23.340 --> 06:48:25.340
the refling can heal up the aggro was

06:48:25.340 --> 06:48:27.340
swapped

06:48:27.340 --> 06:48:29.340
successfully

06:48:29.340 --> 06:48:31.340
we are down to

06:48:31.340 --> 06:48:33.340
just shy of 50% boss health

06:48:33.340 --> 06:48:35.340
does this boss have a face to it

06:48:35.340 --> 06:48:37.340
unlikely due to the fact

06:48:37.340 --> 06:48:39.340
he's in a crypt

06:48:39.340 --> 06:48:41.340
I might have to do it

06:48:41.340 --> 06:48:43.340
I think I might need to help

06:48:43.340 --> 06:48:45.340
oh my god he's still low

06:48:45.340 --> 06:48:47.340
wait

06:48:47.340 --> 06:48:49.340
what's going on

06:48:49.340 --> 06:48:51.340
wait he healed up

06:48:51.340 --> 06:48:53.340
only we're allowed to heal up

06:48:53.340 --> 06:48:55.340
you don't know the rules around these parts

06:48:55.340 --> 06:48:57.340
stinky

06:48:57.340 --> 06:48:59.340
smelly

06:48:59.340 --> 06:49:01.340
and you don't have a tongue scraper

06:49:05.340 --> 06:49:07.340
ok

06:49:07.340 --> 06:49:09.340
I'm gonna go take a cheeky fat loa for bread

06:49:09.340 --> 06:49:11.340
we will be back

06:49:11.340 --> 06:49:13.340
and we will defeat this boss

06:49:13.340 --> 06:49:15.340
I have faith in the refling so I know you guys can do it

06:49:15.340 --> 06:49:17.340
I did

06:49:17.340 --> 06:49:19.340
sorry

06:49:19.340 --> 06:49:21.340
I will be back in a couple of minutes

06:49:21.340 --> 06:49:23.340
give me a few minutes and then I'll

06:49:23.340 --> 06:49:25.340
heat up my food and then we'll do a little

06:49:25.340 --> 06:49:27.340
eating whilst the refling

06:49:27.340 --> 06:49:29.340
absolutely wallop this man's

06:49:29.340 --> 06:49:31.340
booty hole for me

06:49:31.340 --> 06:49:33.340
yes I'm dropping every toothbrush has a tongue

06:49:33.340 --> 06:49:35.340
scraper on the back side

06:49:35.340 --> 06:49:37.340
not electrical

06:49:37.340 --> 06:49:39.340
toothbrushes

06:49:39.340 --> 06:49:41.340
I'm gonna crouch surely I'm not gonna be in

06:49:41.340 --> 06:49:43.340
trouble if I just afk

06:49:43.340 --> 06:49:45.340
right I'll be back in a couple of minutes

06:49:45.340 --> 06:49:47.340
you do need to give me a few seconds ok

06:49:47.340 --> 06:49:49.340
you know cook your little guts

06:49:49.340 --> 06:49:51.340
oh wait actually I need to drink water

06:49:59.340 --> 06:50:01.340
ok the water has been drank

06:50:01.340 --> 06:50:03.340
my guts

06:50:03.340 --> 06:50:05.340
if they do not produce this little

06:50:05.340 --> 06:50:07.340
little loa for bread

06:50:07.340 --> 06:50:09.340
I've been baking for three days

06:50:09.340 --> 06:50:11.340
I think it's been three days

06:50:11.340 --> 06:50:13.340
imagine the smell

07:11:39.340 --> 07:11:41.340
The heavy rule kind of epic though

07:11:43.580 --> 07:11:47.180
If I have the reforms to protect me, ooh, what do you use? It's a crypt

07:11:47.900 --> 07:11:50.620
First off. Well done. By the way, praise the message

07:11:51.260 --> 07:11:54.700
Fine. I'll praise it. Are you applaud? Yeah, fine

07:11:55.500 --> 07:11:57.500
Wait, it's good. Sure

07:11:58.860 --> 07:12:02.780
Heavy mummy the big cake roll. Yeah, we're in big cake territory

07:12:03.660 --> 07:12:09.500
The rule is important for you to dodge that. Oh, no, you're kind of spitting the truth. They're not going

07:12:11.420 --> 07:12:16.460
Oh, everything's such a downgrade on defense like I know why it's a downgrade on defense

07:12:17.180 --> 07:12:19.500
Right if we start tell you what if we struggle

07:12:20.700 --> 07:12:25.660
Um one adversary. Oh wait, I'm an idiot. Sorry adversary takes a week

07:12:28.220 --> 07:12:30.220
Um and you come

07:12:30.220 --> 07:12:32.220
Um

07:12:35.740 --> 07:12:37.660
And then

07:12:37.660 --> 07:12:39.660
Have you explored with me?

07:12:39.740 --> 07:12:43.580
You I know you've explored with me, but I don't think you got a chance to explore with me

07:12:45.660 --> 07:12:47.260
I do

07:12:47.260 --> 07:12:52.460
Only a downgrade if you get hit five heads five heads, right? I should actually eat and get distracted

07:13:00.940 --> 07:13:02.940
Yeah

07:13:04.460 --> 07:13:06.460
Wow, yummy

07:13:09.740 --> 07:13:11.740
I don't know who's gonna come in

07:13:12.700 --> 07:13:14.700
Look outside

07:13:15.980 --> 07:13:17.980
He didn't work

07:13:20.460 --> 07:13:26.060
What do you mean the servers are overloaded because they just they're loaded they just they're not uh, they just

07:13:27.260 --> 07:13:29.260
Publish removed

07:13:30.940 --> 07:13:32.940
Hmm

07:13:36.460 --> 07:13:38.460
You're praising them

07:13:40.860 --> 07:13:44.300
Personal as to just trying that guy's sorry. Oh, you may change the story

07:13:49.900 --> 07:13:51.900
Oh

07:14:00.220 --> 07:14:02.220
You

07:14:08.540 --> 07:14:10.540
Don't be like by my dumpy

07:14:12.060 --> 07:14:14.060
I couldn't do that

07:14:14.220 --> 07:14:16.220
I don't go down

07:14:17.260 --> 07:14:20.060
You'll go down and I do it. I do the animation

07:14:24.700 --> 07:14:26.700
Oh shit, sorry. Oh, let's forget that

07:14:31.180 --> 07:14:34.300
I may be easier for me to upgrade this new item

07:14:37.180 --> 07:14:39.180
Um

07:14:45.260 --> 07:14:47.820
Oh, no, it's actually better. Oh no, this can't be

07:14:54.700 --> 07:14:57.900
Oh as a faster swing, I think or am I just making the off

07:14:58.860 --> 07:15:00.860
I might have a faster swing

07:15:02.140 --> 07:15:07.500
Okay, I follow you guys whilst I munch, okay? There's so many beans in one section

07:15:20.460 --> 07:15:22.460
Easier to upgrade at this stage, yes

07:15:23.420 --> 07:15:25.420
Now that I'm doing oh, sorry, sorry

07:15:38.460 --> 07:15:40.460
Oh, no, I didn't get my class back

07:15:43.740 --> 07:15:45.740
Oh, I've got our class back

07:15:45.740 --> 07:15:47.740
Oh

07:15:51.020 --> 07:15:53.020
It's hard to eat

07:15:58.540 --> 07:16:01.340
It's yummy food, so I hope you guys have eaten and hydrated

07:16:02.220 --> 07:16:04.220
Is

07:16:18.940 --> 07:16:20.940
Oh, you can't use it, okay

07:16:23.020 --> 07:16:25.020
I'll go in a second

07:16:25.740 --> 07:16:27.740
Sorry

07:16:28.140 --> 07:16:30.140
If I could eat in one bite I would

07:16:31.340 --> 07:16:33.340
But

07:16:46.300 --> 07:16:48.300
Yeah

07:16:55.260 --> 07:16:57.260
Drop your other side to the tree today

07:16:58.220 --> 07:17:00.220
Oh

07:17:06.620 --> 07:17:11.900
No, that was a refland in the game. He's clapping. It's not me. I swear

07:17:13.900 --> 07:17:15.900
I'm too busy trying to eat

07:17:17.500 --> 07:17:22.540
I can't eat that fat. Well, I can't eat fast, but I can't like talk and eat fast

07:17:28.220 --> 07:17:35.340
People who hate eating sounds hate this one beat you go find out why about clicking this video

07:17:42.540 --> 07:17:46.220
And you've actually walked around the rocks because I can't jump right now

07:17:49.180 --> 07:17:56.060
Are you fighting in the ooh, what are you? Hello? Oh, I need a jump up hold on. Uh, I need to do this with one hand

07:17:56.860 --> 07:17:58.700
Pick up item

07:17:58.700 --> 07:18:00.700
reverend stirrash

07:18:01.980 --> 07:18:03.980
Hmm

07:18:06.780 --> 07:18:08.780
Light in the way

07:18:10.140 --> 07:18:12.140
I don't know how I'm able to do this right now

07:18:26.780 --> 07:18:28.780
Oh

07:18:31.740 --> 07:18:39.900
I can only I only like your sense. Can you not tolerate it anywhere else? You can only handle the happy cuttlefish munching sounds

07:18:46.380 --> 07:18:49.100
Hmm it's funny because

07:18:49.660 --> 07:18:56.780
My mouth is closed, but if my jaw goes low enough like when I like I'm chewing food when my jaw goes low enough

07:18:56.860 --> 07:19:00.700
My mouth opens on my model. There we go. I've washed it already

07:19:00.700 --> 07:19:02.700
Already

07:19:18.140 --> 07:19:20.140
Hmm

07:19:20.620 --> 07:19:24.620
I don't know if smacking food is uh, are you okay?

07:19:26.300 --> 07:19:28.300
He doesn't do anything

07:19:28.620 --> 07:19:30.620
He is an enemy

07:19:32.220 --> 07:19:34.220
But he doesn't respond to anything

07:19:36.060 --> 07:19:39.180
I think um smacking food is a learned behavior

07:19:40.380 --> 07:19:42.380
I suppose others we mushroom here

07:19:51.580 --> 07:19:54.140
God this graveyard is it you never end them

07:19:54.860 --> 07:19:57.740
You'll lighten up around here. She should probably

07:20:14.780 --> 07:20:16.780
There is more food hiding under my natural

07:20:19.340 --> 07:20:22.140
I don't want to waste the food because this is all the food I got right now

07:20:25.020 --> 07:20:27.020
Oh

07:20:32.940 --> 07:20:35.820
No, can you guys get him for me?

07:20:42.700 --> 07:20:46.220
I'll be out here you two just go on ahead and have fun, okay

07:20:47.580 --> 07:20:49.580
Me and the rival

07:20:51.580 --> 07:20:53.580
Just be checking it out

07:20:54.380 --> 07:20:56.380
All right. No, he's getting there

07:21:04.540 --> 07:21:06.540
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

07:21:11.660 --> 07:21:16.140
Uh sat sat do tree fragment

07:21:16.220 --> 07:21:23.020
Uh, okay, I'm to the next I've almost finished eating. I'm so sorry

07:21:33.180 --> 07:21:35.180
We love chicken salad

07:21:35.420 --> 07:21:37.420
Yeah

07:21:44.860 --> 07:21:46.860
That refunds a war crime pride

07:21:50.460 --> 07:21:52.460
Hmm

07:21:52.460 --> 07:21:54.460
Oh

07:22:10.140 --> 07:22:13.340
So violent I follow the torch

07:22:15.500 --> 07:22:18.140
I am a simple woman. I see instructions

07:22:22.780 --> 07:22:30.460
Grumble some chips on top of the salad to have makeshift crouton. I've never enjoyed crouton. I thought they were just dried stale bread or something

07:22:32.780 --> 07:22:34.780
That was my impression of the man

07:22:35.980 --> 07:22:38.620
She says she eats stale naturals, but I don't mean

07:22:47.340 --> 07:22:49.340
Um

07:22:49.660 --> 07:22:53.740
And I keep saying that but we'll play if you were basically

07:22:56.220 --> 07:22:59.980
I'll hurry up. I'll catch up. I'll catch up. I'll run. I'll run

07:23:02.620 --> 07:23:07.100
I just need like what five more nachos and I'm actually done through for real this time

07:23:10.220 --> 07:23:13.740
I'm coming. Just give me a second. I'm coming. I'm coming

07:23:15.020 --> 07:23:17.020
Just a few more nachos

07:23:17.020 --> 07:23:23.020
And this will feel me for the rest of the stream. I honestly thought I was probably only gonna do eight hours

07:23:24.140 --> 07:23:25.500
today

07:23:25.500 --> 07:23:29.340
This will be like, uh, I'm gonna really feel it. I didn't get a good sleep or whatever and then

07:23:30.140 --> 07:23:32.140
classic me since I get on

07:23:34.540 --> 07:23:36.540
I can't have enough

07:23:40.940 --> 07:23:45.100
Oh, Jim's day done. Thank you for the super chat. I just saw that there in the notification

07:23:45.820 --> 07:23:47.820
I missed it

07:23:49.020 --> 07:23:54.780
Only eight hours like I know it's a unique concept, but

07:23:56.140 --> 07:23:58.140
I love it, man

07:23:58.940 --> 07:24:04.220
Like we're literally getting princess house through Elden Ring DLC. I have no idea what's going on. I'm happy. I'm smiling

07:24:04.300 --> 07:24:11.740
I'm eating. Hopefully you guys have eaten and hydrated like you guys are literally coming in and I'm like celebrating cheering for you when you

07:24:12.620 --> 07:24:16.860
Oh my god, are they gone? Reeflings? Hello? Hello?

07:24:19.180 --> 07:24:21.180
Over here

07:24:21.820 --> 07:24:24.540
Where the fuck did they go? Oh, all right. Okay. Oh, there we go. Sorry

07:24:29.180 --> 07:24:31.180
Just eight

07:24:31.900 --> 07:24:35.740
As I choke because I'm trying to talk and eat. Sorry. I'm gonna shut up. I'm gonna choke

07:24:42.700 --> 07:24:44.700
I

07:25:00.540 --> 07:25:04.220
The food doesn't disappear it's like more keeps appearing on my bowl

07:25:12.060 --> 07:25:14.060
Hmm

07:25:22.140 --> 07:25:28.060
Do you think when game studios plan something so large they already plan the DLC in mind

07:25:29.260 --> 07:25:34.380
Like this was already in production. Just like it will be like a different that comes out a different timing

07:25:35.980 --> 07:25:39.100
So this is massive like absolutely massive

07:25:42.380 --> 07:25:44.380
Never end them

07:25:50.700 --> 07:25:53.260
I'm getting free souls for every time you guys whack someone

07:25:57.340 --> 07:25:59.340
You got it

07:26:12.700 --> 07:26:17.420
Okay, I'm okay. Thank you. Thank you. I'm I'm getting through it

07:26:29.500 --> 07:26:31.580
I'm swinging. I don't know if I'm hitting anything

07:26:33.900 --> 07:26:37.980
Oh, yeah, we have necronomic effect or something

07:26:42.700 --> 07:26:46.220
I'm fucking swinging. Oh, I've only got one shoulder

07:27:07.100 --> 07:27:09.100
I think we're okay

07:27:10.060 --> 07:27:17.020
I think we're okay. Okay. No, I'm potting. I'm potting. Okay. I'll buy him. What'd I get? I bet

07:27:18.220 --> 07:27:20.940
Okay, I have two more baitfuls. I think um

07:27:21.820 --> 07:27:23.980
And I'm done. I ate

07:27:25.180 --> 07:27:27.180
I hydrated questionable

07:27:28.220 --> 07:27:30.220
Um

07:27:30.220 --> 07:27:32.220
Oh

07:27:45.580 --> 07:27:48.780
And then I I wipe my greasy fingers

07:27:49.500 --> 07:27:53.420
And I we nap him and then I wipe my mouth on the napkin as well

07:27:54.140 --> 07:27:56.140
Hmm

07:27:57.740 --> 07:28:03.420
And then I'm all clean. It's prissy. I think I drink a cola

07:28:06.300 --> 07:28:08.300
I think I drink a warm

07:28:13.900 --> 07:28:15.900
Oh

07:28:17.180 --> 07:28:21.020
I've been DLC on the lunch DLC that you buy layers

07:28:21.100 --> 07:28:25.740
Um, okay, we're ready. I'm like properly in. I'm locked in. Are we ready refunds?

07:28:26.540 --> 07:28:29.580
Let's get a move on. Come on refund. You're gonna get left behind you goober

07:28:29.980 --> 07:28:31.820
Gotta get a move on

07:28:31.820 --> 07:28:33.420
as I say

07:28:33.420 --> 07:28:36.060
As I do a heavy roll follow the light

07:28:37.260 --> 07:28:39.260
Oh, there's like a thing here

07:28:39.420 --> 07:28:41.420
Uh black pry fly

07:28:44.860 --> 07:28:47.100
I have very quiet rupees today

07:28:48.780 --> 07:28:50.780
Oh

07:28:51.100 --> 07:28:53.100
Okay, a little shortcut

07:28:57.180 --> 07:28:59.180
This is an endurance freedom

07:29:01.020 --> 07:29:06.460
It was always gonna be 12 hours. Let's be honest. Let's let's not kid ourselves unless my voice

07:29:07.260 --> 07:29:10.780
quite literally breaks where I cannot speak

07:29:12.220 --> 07:29:14.220
I probably can't stream

07:29:14.380 --> 07:29:19.340
But even then you already know that I'm autistic enough to do hand cam ASMR

07:29:19.980 --> 07:29:25.500
And all you hear is my breathing because I'm just like giggling that everything you guys are saying. Ooh new enemies

07:29:27.580 --> 07:29:29.580
Like

07:29:29.580 --> 07:29:31.580
You know, I can't so

07:29:32.460 --> 07:29:34.780
I'm addicted and I can't get enough

07:29:35.900 --> 07:29:42.060
I've so much lost time to make up for and like it's just like such a good thing and like I'm serious when I say like

07:29:42.620 --> 07:29:48.620
I never feel it's when I click go live live. I don't feel stressed. I don't feel like oh my god

07:29:48.620 --> 07:29:50.620
I need to do xyz like right now

07:29:51.260 --> 07:29:53.260
When I finish this endurance stream

07:29:53.820 --> 07:29:58.060
I need to go edit the audio. That's for patreon and upload it

07:29:58.780 --> 07:30:02.940
And I know that's going to take me over an hour and I know I'm going to be tired but right now

07:30:03.740 --> 07:30:05.500
I feel relaxed

07:30:05.500 --> 07:30:07.500
I'm happy

07:30:07.660 --> 07:30:10.140
I'm chilling someone just got stabbed over there

07:30:11.020 --> 07:30:13.020
Are we beating up birds now?

07:30:13.340 --> 07:30:15.340
We are

07:30:15.580 --> 07:30:17.580
The most friendly bird in Australia

07:30:19.260 --> 07:30:22.460
Right, what am I supposed to do with these swords? I'm supposed to take something all

07:30:23.420 --> 07:30:25.420
Right, oh god by the time

07:30:25.420 --> 07:30:26.300
I'm supposed to do what?

07:30:26.300 --> 07:30:28.300
I'm supposed to take this off

07:30:28.460 --> 07:30:33.260
Have this boy out and then hold y right from 4 to 200

07:30:34.620 --> 07:30:36.620
And then one okay

07:30:36.860 --> 07:30:40.300
I ain't gonna tell you what I was supposed to do. New shot card it mutes Ronnie every time

07:30:41.100 --> 07:30:45.820
She can't tell if she says she gets zapped. Honestly, that would actually be content because I can't even

07:30:49.020 --> 07:30:51.020
I got to do the first thing

07:30:51.900 --> 07:30:53.900
Well, we're going into this cavern

07:30:54.700 --> 07:30:58.620
It's got quite a magnificent entrance. I must say whoever architect this

07:30:59.420 --> 07:31:01.420
I hope you're paying them well because uh

07:31:01.660 --> 07:31:05.740
That is a tourist attraction in a half if that was in real life, you know

07:31:11.020 --> 07:31:13.020
It's

07:31:13.420 --> 07:31:15.420
Oh, there's something glowing

07:31:18.220 --> 07:31:20.220
Wow

07:31:22.780 --> 07:31:28.940
Is it a site of grace, but it's just highlighted more. I'm gonna go crazy. What are you?

07:31:30.380 --> 07:31:32.380
Touch the cross

07:31:32.540 --> 07:31:36.860
Carved words conceal I abandon here the first of the flesh of my body

07:31:41.100 --> 07:31:45.100
Fragment is this mackayla or mackoella?

07:31:47.660 --> 07:31:54.220
Also, don't forget your blue flash so you can do your weapon or or you can change them into more health. Yeah, I think I'm

07:31:55.020 --> 07:31:57.020
Definitely more health

07:31:57.260 --> 07:31:59.980
Wait, why are you clapping because I just oh I need to talk to him

07:32:00.780 --> 07:32:02.780
Lady led a spoke of you

07:32:02.780 --> 07:32:04.540
You're that tarnished

07:32:04.540 --> 07:32:08.940
Guided here by kindly michella. Bloody or be driver question mark. I am freya

07:32:09.820 --> 07:32:11.820
I once fought alongside general redan

07:32:13.420 --> 07:32:15.420
You can be sure I'll hold my own

07:32:21.500 --> 07:32:23.500
One if you've yet to do so

07:32:23.580 --> 07:32:26.140
Have him give you a map of the crosses whereabouts

07:32:26.700 --> 07:32:28.860
You'll find more of them dotted about these lands

07:32:29.500 --> 07:32:31.660
They are michella the kinds footprints

07:32:33.740 --> 07:32:35.740
Um

07:32:35.980 --> 07:32:37.980
Why are you on the floor? Are you okay?

07:32:38.460 --> 07:32:40.460
He's hired

07:32:40.940 --> 07:32:42.460
Micoleta

07:32:42.460 --> 07:32:45.500
Nicholas cage. Yeah, uh, we're doing the Nicholas cage deal fee

07:32:46.140 --> 07:32:49.900
As much as I've had to spend all the time in the world with you. I don't want you to be the cost of your health

07:32:50.140 --> 07:32:53.740
I don't I'm not unhealthy when I suppose

07:32:56.060 --> 07:32:58.060
Right what I want to do am I to follow?

07:32:59.420 --> 07:33:01.420
Oh my god, I might need to fart on her on a clip

07:33:01.980 --> 07:33:03.980
I

07:33:04.540 --> 07:33:07.420
Let out the world's tiniest it wasn't even audible

07:33:09.420 --> 07:33:12.460
I felt my my cheeks just part just a little

07:33:16.540 --> 07:33:18.540
Foot prints sniff

07:33:20.220 --> 07:33:22.700
Zero out of ten no, you know right in my tooth

07:33:25.660 --> 07:33:27.660
You can rate the burps but not the toots

07:33:28.460 --> 07:33:32.460
Part to burrs part to burrs. No brat burrs and shambles

07:33:38.380 --> 07:33:40.380
Hold on a minute. Wait. Oh my god, what's going on?

07:33:43.980 --> 07:33:47.500
Oh, they're like silent. I'm just gonna leave the mic on. Sorry. I'm

07:33:48.140 --> 07:33:53.340
Sorry to be so gross and but like they're silent. You're not gonna hear them. I'll just leave the mic on

07:33:54.620 --> 07:33:56.620
And you just have to guess

07:33:58.620 --> 07:34:00.620
When I let one rip

07:34:02.300 --> 07:34:09.260
Bit bruising shambles they are over me. She's not unhealthy. She's just seen junk food. She's just like us

07:34:11.340 --> 07:34:15.580
Oh, there's another cross. Okay, let's carry out this

07:34:19.980 --> 07:34:21.660
Uh, hello

07:34:21.660 --> 07:34:23.660
Hello there together

07:34:24.060 --> 07:34:28.860
We work together for michela the kind. Yes many things

07:34:29.740 --> 07:34:31.740
We have found

07:34:33.260 --> 07:34:37.580
What have you found dear traveler? Um

07:34:38.380 --> 07:34:44.060
Pickled lever template grants boosts and stuff. Do you give me anything I should know about?

07:34:46.780 --> 07:34:48.780
No

07:34:49.180 --> 07:34:52.700
Well pickle turtle neck pamphlet grants a large boost of stamina

07:34:53.900 --> 07:34:55.900
Everything that is

07:34:59.820 --> 07:35:01.820
Touch the cross

07:35:02.540 --> 07:35:07.500
And then speak to you. Where's your face? Are you this way? Oh, you're this way?

07:35:09.180 --> 07:35:12.540
You must be the tarnished. Yes. I am ansma. Hello

07:35:13.420 --> 07:35:19.820
Formerly in service to lord. I may or may not perish now like you another soul guided by kindly michela

07:35:20.380 --> 07:35:22.620
I'm hardly the steady hand. I once was

07:35:23.980 --> 07:35:25.980
My fighting days are far behind me

07:35:26.700 --> 07:35:30.300
Which is why I have chosen to dedicate myself to investigation

07:35:30.940 --> 07:35:33.580
To discern tender michela's ultimate purpose

07:35:34.220 --> 07:35:39.580
I'd rather not volunteer service to a new master unless I know that I can be of use

07:35:39.900 --> 07:35:41.900
Yeah

07:35:42.940 --> 07:35:48.300
I created a new character this morning unaware of the power level my fellow reeflings to carry you

07:35:48.300 --> 07:35:50.300
I've already caught up to my other

07:35:50.780 --> 07:35:53.260
Characters and levels. So I'm gonna keep going. Yeah

07:35:54.700 --> 07:35:58.300
Like I would it's quite possible. We'll go back to like lemgraves and stuff

07:35:58.380 --> 07:36:04.140
I think I'm gonna hit a power wall where you guys it's like too impossible for you guys to carry me

07:36:04.940 --> 07:36:06.940
quite possibly so

07:36:07.900 --> 07:36:14.780
We may go back to like lemgraves and like do the actual stuff because like I do need weapon dream stuff, but

07:36:15.740 --> 07:36:21.660
Yes, it is kind of like god. I'd be exhausted going up like forced it. So I'm like, okay. I think I'm done by now

07:36:25.980 --> 07:36:30.140
As soon as more editors in cooperation release in her job, he's filled that no

07:36:31.900 --> 07:36:33.900
That's so funny

07:36:34.300 --> 07:36:38.700
Uh, I open manually this door is too big for me to be pushing again

07:36:40.380 --> 07:36:42.380
Oh, no reeflings wait

07:36:44.300 --> 07:36:47.980
Reeflings did we do something we weren't supposed to

07:36:51.500 --> 07:36:52.620
Oh

07:36:52.620 --> 07:36:59.740
You're retired. You're out of bounds of the playable area. I'm afraid refilling your service of guiding me ends here because we need to go and save

07:37:01.100 --> 07:37:03.100
Thank you very much

07:37:04.860 --> 07:37:07.260
Uh, I'm only at level

07:37:08.540 --> 07:37:10.380
What level?

07:37:10.380 --> 07:37:12.860
I mean, I spoofed my level 191

07:37:14.140 --> 07:37:16.460
What are you making? What are you doing?

07:37:17.500 --> 07:37:19.500
What was that?

07:37:20.460 --> 07:37:23.100
Are you imagining yourself to pass away?

07:37:27.100 --> 07:37:29.660
One more reefing and then I go through and then

07:37:30.620 --> 07:37:34.140
We see what's on the other side. Thank you reeflings for understanding

07:37:38.700 --> 07:37:40.700
How's that oh gimme on

07:37:46.540 --> 07:37:52.620
Hold on I need to check on fucking gimme. You can't pause this game. Can you hold on? Sorry

07:38:00.620 --> 07:38:02.620
It's cold

07:38:03.660 --> 07:38:05.660
Why are you doing this to me?

07:38:11.900 --> 07:38:13.900
Oh

07:38:14.860 --> 07:38:19.100
She's so silly. She doesn't cry and it's basically a cat's cry

07:38:19.740 --> 07:38:23.180
For I need help and it freaks me out of everything she does it

07:38:24.460 --> 07:38:26.460
It's a high-pitched cry

07:38:26.620 --> 07:38:29.340
Um, which is what they do to get their mom

07:38:31.500 --> 07:38:33.500
If you want to be

07:38:45.820 --> 07:38:47.820
She literally

07:38:47.980 --> 07:38:53.500
And then as soon as she sees me she's like, oh, you're still alive and then walks away again go outside and play game

07:38:53.820 --> 07:38:55.820
go outside

07:38:56.060 --> 07:39:00.060
Literally, right. Did that scorpion thing leave me alone? I'm still alive. Sorry

07:39:00.620 --> 07:39:07.660
It freaks me out when she does the creedisha. It's what kittens do to get their mom and I'm like, oh my god. What's wrong? What's wrong? Um

07:39:08.620 --> 07:39:12.300
Nothing's wrong. Right. What the fuck is going on here. There's like a scorpion

07:39:14.140 --> 07:39:16.140
How many just one

07:39:16.620 --> 07:39:18.460
Am I good? Am I

07:39:18.460 --> 07:39:20.460
Can I run

07:39:21.100 --> 07:39:25.100
There's no way I have any power to do anything against that

07:39:26.300 --> 07:39:28.300
Oh

07:39:28.540 --> 07:39:30.540
Hey, at least you're not level 40 right now

07:39:32.620 --> 07:39:34.620
That just go for it

07:39:36.620 --> 07:39:39.740
Oh, just go for it. Just go for it. There'll be a save station

07:39:41.900 --> 07:39:45.340
I'm safe the reeflings have me they just need to

07:39:47.900 --> 07:39:51.900
I don't need that right now. I need the reeflings to be able to

07:39:52.780 --> 07:39:53.900
I

07:39:53.900 --> 07:39:55.900
There has to be a save station

07:39:57.260 --> 07:39:59.260
I refuse to believe there's not

07:40:01.740 --> 07:40:03.580
Oh, I'm

07:40:03.580 --> 07:40:10.700
My heavy roll heavy roll heavy roll that reefling you're allowed to say you told me so you're so allowed to say you told me so right now

07:40:11.260 --> 07:40:14.140
Oh my god, you're so allowed to say you told me so

07:40:16.300 --> 07:40:18.860
You are allowed to say it until I perish

07:40:19.660 --> 07:40:21.660
You are allowed to say I told you so

07:40:25.820 --> 07:40:26.860
Okay

07:40:26.860 --> 07:40:33.020
Betrayed by the armor upgrade getting this shite off me stripped me down. I'm no having it get that back on

07:40:33.980 --> 07:40:35.260
get

07:40:35.260 --> 07:40:41.260
These back on what are they weight is like nothing honestly. I'm now medium load so

07:40:42.380 --> 07:40:45.500
Is my my roll could be faster if I'm not mistaken

07:40:45.820 --> 07:40:49.580
Does this put me on late loads

07:40:57.820 --> 07:40:59.820
Being very dumb

07:41:00.300 --> 07:41:02.300
I don't know how this works

07:41:02.380 --> 07:41:05.660
I assume that doesn't do anything. Oh that is actually fair

07:41:07.660 --> 07:41:09.660
Okay, well I can do this now

07:41:09.740 --> 07:41:16.460
Light load is 30 percent medium is what people typically have light is very hard to do without just straight up being

07:41:18.300 --> 07:41:21.820
I have no idea what your name is but sure and you come

07:41:23.580 --> 07:41:26.940
What on earth is your name to get it all censored?

07:41:28.780 --> 07:41:30.780
What is your name?

07:41:31.020 --> 07:41:33.020
You

07:41:37.260 --> 07:41:39.260
Heard her strip down last

07:41:39.500 --> 07:41:44.700
Literally, oh, I'm so sorry if I seem out of sorts. Give me doing that me. I'll freak me out

07:41:45.180 --> 07:41:46.620
Fuck out

07:41:46.620 --> 07:41:51.340
It literally is the cry of a kitten for its mom and I'm like what is wrong

07:41:52.860 --> 07:41:57.580
Oh, can I be doing that to my hand? Oh, no. Is there no reefing here?

07:41:57.740 --> 07:42:04.780
Is it just us I see some enemy for the same

07:42:06.540 --> 07:42:08.540
Oh, are you tipping me?

07:42:09.180 --> 07:42:14.300
Oh, here we go. Here we go. Right. We've got enemy and a friendly right do the friendly first and then do the enemy

07:42:16.060 --> 07:42:18.060
Enemy enemy I got up an enemy

07:42:19.500 --> 07:42:21.500
She and needy

07:42:21.820 --> 07:42:23.020
a

07:42:23.020 --> 07:42:24.700
unable to summon

07:42:24.700 --> 07:42:26.700
adversary, huh

07:42:26.940 --> 07:42:30.620
Are we being invaded? We've literally had like two seconds to freaking

07:42:31.820 --> 07:42:35.580
Get in here. Are you tipping me glowstone for you?

07:42:37.820 --> 07:42:42.780
Okay, why can I not have an adversary and he didn't have an adversary. Okay, and you come

07:42:45.420 --> 07:42:47.420
He's healing me. Oh

07:42:49.740 --> 07:42:51.740
Oh, it does

07:42:52.300 --> 07:42:54.300
Oh

07:42:55.900 --> 07:43:01.500
I didn't really heal. Oh, I'm pretty sure I have I'll have enough left. Thank you for your heel

07:43:03.260 --> 07:43:05.260
The adversary making it in

07:43:09.820 --> 07:43:13.820
Because you didn't say the grace look I was just so happy that I can get the reef on the back

07:43:13.820 --> 07:43:19.980
Okay, that was scary. I missed something at the bottom of that statue. I don't know if I need to do that for the lore

07:43:20.700 --> 07:43:27.260
There was a statue a walk past when all the wee baby scorpions came out. Oh, I've not blessed us. Okay. I need to bless our journey

07:43:29.100 --> 07:43:32.300
If you would like to lie down and I will bless you all for this journey

07:43:36.300 --> 07:43:39.500
No, you just want to lead the way you're like, you're like nah, come on

07:43:40.940 --> 07:43:42.060
Oh

07:43:42.060 --> 07:43:43.660
Okay

07:43:43.660 --> 07:43:45.660
rival reefing and you just want to

07:43:47.020 --> 07:43:49.020
Oh, you changed clore

07:43:49.980 --> 07:43:51.980
Oh makes it you look friendly

07:43:52.700 --> 07:43:56.540
You know the rules it doesn't it doesn't matter. There's enough holes for everyone

07:43:59.660 --> 07:44:01.660
I'm sorry. I heard the rival

07:44:04.540 --> 07:44:12.300
Okay, let's head off on our adventure. I am going to put my nightlight on that keeps me safe from the enemies

07:44:12.460 --> 07:44:14.460
That's how it works clearly

07:44:16.060 --> 07:44:19.260
Few enemies few enemies got a lot of enemies

07:44:23.420 --> 07:44:25.420
Uh-huh, that was a bit silly

07:44:29.100 --> 07:44:34.700
Oh wait, I need to hand it press y and rate bumper to two hands away. Yeah, I'm too smart. I remember

07:44:35.820 --> 07:44:38.620
Wait, what was that? I saw that

07:44:39.820 --> 07:44:41.500
I have more not

07:44:41.500 --> 07:44:43.500
originally

07:44:46.460 --> 07:44:50.700
The blazing is why I'm trying to speed through my levels right now. I mean

07:44:51.660 --> 07:44:54.780
Oh wait, I was going to be like, oh you can catch up

07:44:56.140 --> 07:44:58.940
I'm doing 12 hour endurance of those

07:45:00.700 --> 07:45:02.700
Can you catch up?

07:45:03.260 --> 07:45:08.300
I don't mean it as in a dower way, but I'm like you would have to like what is what is that?

07:45:12.220 --> 07:45:14.220
Attacking

07:45:14.620 --> 07:45:16.620
Silver horn tender

07:45:20.060 --> 07:45:22.060
Hey

07:45:26.460 --> 07:45:30.620
Oh, it's our pantry look we have sage hanging and we have the onion

07:45:30.940 --> 07:45:33.420
If you didn't know this is actually how you saw onions

07:45:33.420 --> 07:45:36.940
You need to dry them out before storage and then they can last the whole year

07:45:37.500 --> 07:45:44.140
It's pretty cool, honestly to think that something so simple is removing the water like makes food last longer

07:45:44.140 --> 07:45:47.740
But that's also what a dehydrator thingy my barber does

07:45:48.700 --> 07:45:50.460
and

07:45:50.460 --> 07:45:52.460
I will try my best to catch up

07:45:58.140 --> 07:46:04.940
It is possible we might have to go back at some point. Um, not all the streams are gonna be

07:46:07.900 --> 07:46:11.500
See even get I was gonna say does this guy even get staggered?

07:46:12.140 --> 07:46:15.980
Um, it is possible some days. I might only have eight hours

07:46:16.620 --> 07:46:17.660
um

07:46:17.660 --> 07:46:24.300
But today and tomorrow is like a hundred percent twelve hours. Um, it's one of the give myself an animal

07:46:26.860 --> 07:46:31.020
Um, then I am completely fine if

07:46:31.740 --> 07:46:35.020
There's anything there that I don't want to activate that man. Um

07:46:37.020 --> 07:46:41.500
The third day I might need a cheeky eight hours and to get

07:46:42.940 --> 07:46:44.940
Oh, no

07:46:50.940 --> 07:46:52.940
What are they

07:46:53.820 --> 07:46:55.820
Like dragonfly

07:46:57.900 --> 07:46:59.900
Or drop something

07:46:59.900 --> 07:47:02.460
Oh silver horn tender. I guess those are what those are

07:47:03.260 --> 07:47:07.740
I'm getting smithing stones everywhere. Is that is that river gonna blow me down?

07:47:09.340 --> 07:47:12.140
I don't I'm I'm scared. Is that gonna push me down?

07:47:13.100 --> 07:47:15.740
I was just on me there. Sorry. I wasn't paying attention

07:47:18.780 --> 07:47:20.780
There's no waiting for strong anything

07:47:21.820 --> 07:47:28.700
No, I don't give up. I'm gonna go back to limb graving like level up and do like the actual main quest and stuff

07:47:32.860 --> 07:47:35.260
Good night we flings. Good night. Rest well

07:47:38.380 --> 07:47:40.380
Store room key

07:47:42.860 --> 07:47:44.860
Why yes the store room key

07:47:47.980 --> 07:47:52.700
Okay, now that way we're jumping over here. Oh, there's a weak thing here. Hold on

07:47:54.620 --> 07:47:57.820
Throwing dagger tangles free

07:47:58.540 --> 07:48:00.540
I

07:48:02.140 --> 07:48:03.980
That new armor that is only like old

07:48:05.820 --> 07:48:07.820
Who or what oh a bird

07:48:09.980 --> 07:48:12.700
Beat that bird up show nature what we think about it

07:48:13.820 --> 07:48:15.580
those

07:48:15.580 --> 07:48:17.580
Huh

07:48:19.580 --> 07:48:22.940
Is that a wee bit buggy just a wee bit buggy

07:48:23.660 --> 07:48:29.260
Okay, I think that was just like a wee bug. Bird stuck. Bird stuck

07:48:35.500 --> 07:48:41.020
We're just beating up everything in our path. I thought rival reef and right right ball replaying

07:48:41.820 --> 07:48:44.700
Say rival refling 10 times fast

07:48:45.820 --> 07:48:50.060
rival reefing rival reef. Oh, are you gonna stop on the first one rival replaying?

07:48:53.740 --> 07:48:55.740
Yeah

07:48:55.980 --> 07:49:00.460
I'm healing by the fire and I'm healing by the fire

07:49:00.860 --> 07:49:05.580
And the fire is healing me and it makes sure I have lots of flasks

07:49:06.220 --> 07:49:13.100
Because I'm so under level over level, but I don't have the upgrade. Wait, don't do that

07:49:14.540 --> 07:49:16.540
It says he goes it says go forth

07:49:17.100 --> 07:49:18.700
Oh

07:49:18.700 --> 07:49:22.700
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Hold on. What do you do? What do you do big slam big slam?

07:49:23.020 --> 07:49:25.020
No, I'm here

07:49:25.180 --> 07:49:29.180
Now you will handle my club. Oh, how did I dodge? I don't even know

07:49:32.620 --> 07:49:37.820
Fifty five damage while everyone literally came in close. Oh, I'm out of stamina

07:49:38.780 --> 07:49:40.780
Summon stamina. I'm out of stamina

07:49:48.940 --> 07:49:50.940
No, the reefing didn't fail

07:49:53.740 --> 07:49:55.740
I

07:49:59.980 --> 07:50:01.980
No, I'm so weak

07:50:06.620 --> 07:50:12.300
Wait, he wasn't was he even that bad? Okay, this is why I think we're going back to limb grave

07:50:16.460 --> 07:50:20.140
This is why I think we might be slightly going back to limb grave

07:50:23.740 --> 07:50:25.740
Just the wee bit

07:50:26.060 --> 07:50:30.860
Just the wee bit back to limb grave a new map has been found. Wow

07:50:32.860 --> 07:50:34.860
Wow

07:50:37.900 --> 07:50:39.900
In the realm of shadow

07:50:42.460 --> 07:50:45.100
Okay, we are in small private altar

07:50:46.860 --> 07:50:48.860
Gee

07:50:49.100 --> 07:50:53.340
Look at that it's all being decimated at the back of the cast all those seems like a green area

07:50:53.340 --> 07:50:58.060
Oh my god, are we actually going to have a nature area that doesn't look like completely decimated?

07:50:59.740 --> 07:51:01.740
This is where all the people the month

07:51:03.740 --> 07:51:05.740
In the shadow realm

07:51:06.060 --> 07:51:10.300
Have we got all the wrong that was absolutely not your name by the way

07:51:12.860 --> 07:51:14.860
Um

07:51:15.100 --> 07:51:17.100
All right

07:51:21.820 --> 07:51:23.820
An area that doesn't look this

07:51:24.300 --> 07:51:27.420
Decimated in Elden ring for a chance

07:51:27.580 --> 07:51:32.700
I mean, it would be nice to see like the game dev team have a nice non broken area

07:51:32.700 --> 07:51:35.660
Like the closest you get is what the roundhouse table

07:51:37.660 --> 07:51:40.780
Um, um wait because it's such a new rule

07:51:42.700 --> 07:51:44.700
And then a rival

07:51:45.340 --> 07:51:47.340
What is your name that's gonna bother you

07:51:51.020 --> 07:51:53.020
Real one of souls that everything has to stop

07:51:54.140 --> 07:51:56.940
Oh, we need to do the blessings so we don't get ruled again

07:51:58.700 --> 07:52:01.340
If everyone wants to lie down next to each other one friend

07:52:03.020 --> 07:52:05.500
If you have the lie down one, I don't even think I'll have

07:52:06.380 --> 07:52:08.380
Confirm remove switch

07:52:09.660 --> 07:52:13.180
Oh lie down isn't a default. I wonder where you get lie down

07:52:14.060 --> 07:52:17.580
Oh, you guys all seem to have it. So you must be playing the game. Well

07:52:22.460 --> 07:52:24.620
Only one of you will take HP that one

07:52:26.380 --> 07:52:28.380
But it is a sacrifice

07:52:32.380 --> 07:52:34.380
Just don't pronounce the H

07:52:36.940 --> 07:52:39.660
Ah learning never

07:52:39.820 --> 07:52:41.820
We're

07:52:42.140 --> 07:52:44.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

07:52:45.420 --> 07:52:47.420
Name wonder he's wiping his way

07:52:47.740 --> 07:52:50.140
Why did I start leaving a message there?

07:52:52.060 --> 07:52:54.060
Oh my god

07:52:54.140 --> 07:52:56.140
Okay, now we're getting back

07:52:56.540 --> 07:52:58.540
absolute

07:52:58.540 --> 07:53:00.540
absolutely

07:53:02.700 --> 07:53:04.700
I don't know where my souls are

07:53:04.700 --> 07:53:06.700
Oh

07:53:08.620 --> 07:53:10.620
Are we are we crowded around the healing stone?

07:53:12.300 --> 07:53:14.300
Thank you for the healing stone

07:53:14.700 --> 07:53:19.020
My full health. I'm full health. I don't know where I've lost my souls, but it's fine

07:53:19.660 --> 07:53:22.220
I'm sure someone will kindly drop me

07:53:25.340 --> 07:53:26.540
Um

07:53:26.540 --> 07:53:31.660
Like a billion dragon souls again, and then I just although I've levelled up

07:53:31.740 --> 07:53:35.820
I just need decent armor and stuff and not to be bad at the game really

07:53:36.700 --> 07:53:42.060
Really, it's kind of the classic case of don't be bad. I hate to admit it, but

07:53:42.860 --> 07:53:45.260
As soon as I get decent weapon

07:53:46.300 --> 07:53:48.300
I'm literally getting rolled by

07:53:48.460 --> 07:53:50.460
No

07:54:05.660 --> 07:54:07.900
We're fine. I'm out of stamina, but we're fine

07:54:10.620 --> 07:54:17.340
Unlocking your flask upgrade would probably be most important right now drop 99 armor refling can't do that

07:54:18.380 --> 07:54:25.420
It's a shame, but we can't do it. I was saying that you guys like dropped me so many weapons and armor like I don't even question. I'm just like, oh

07:54:26.620 --> 07:54:28.380
Refling first

07:54:28.380 --> 07:54:30.380
What does that mean?

07:54:31.100 --> 07:54:34.300
Is that unfriendly? I have a feeling that might have been unfriendly

07:54:35.580 --> 07:54:42.060
Uh, something's attacking me. I don't know what but uh, we'll just keep going forward. That's the main thing

07:54:43.820 --> 07:54:45.820
Wasn't the bird was it?

07:54:46.780 --> 07:54:48.780
What did you admire this man?

07:54:49.980 --> 07:54:57.180
Okay. Oh, okay. You were literally turned into kfc chicken wings within what two seconds. Yeah

07:54:58.460 --> 07:55:00.460
Don't mess with me or the beefling

07:55:06.540 --> 07:55:08.540
Are you sat down there

07:55:09.740 --> 07:55:11.420
A bit of working out

07:55:11.420 --> 07:55:12.940
Oh

07:55:12.940 --> 07:55:16.220
I just smashed a pole on his head pita will be in contact

07:55:20.460 --> 07:55:22.460
Oh, did we I am here

07:55:24.220 --> 07:55:28.380
Uh, oh, this is where my souls are I found them

07:55:33.180 --> 07:55:37.740
Wow if you can okay now take the aggro off of them

07:55:37.740 --> 07:55:39.740
Oh

07:55:41.260 --> 07:55:43.260
Okay, yeah

07:55:43.900 --> 07:55:46.780
Okay, if we like switch the aggro we're fine

07:55:47.740 --> 07:55:52.380
Yeah, genuinely absolutely fine if we uh five head up. Is that my healing stone?

07:55:52.620 --> 07:55:55.340
Is that my healing stone here if you don't want to use the flag?

07:55:59.660 --> 07:56:01.660
I only did it a little bit but that's

07:56:03.180 --> 07:56:05.180
Uh

07:56:05.820 --> 07:56:07.820
This way

07:56:13.900 --> 07:56:15.900
Whoa

07:56:18.540 --> 07:56:20.540
I have like a billion eggs, hey

07:56:24.460 --> 07:56:26.460
More of those ingredients

07:56:30.780 --> 07:56:32.780
Oh

07:56:33.420 --> 07:56:39.420
Yeah, see I missed one of these back there. So whatever this is, I hope it's not too important

07:56:40.860 --> 07:56:48.060
Oh, I was a reverent spirit ash. I might might need to go back for that. It seems rather important. I don't want to

07:56:49.980 --> 07:56:52.540
I don't want to tell you on how it should be, but he's rather

07:56:52.940 --> 07:56:54.940
I

07:56:59.340 --> 07:57:01.340
Love

07:57:06.300 --> 07:57:08.300
Sorry the heat

07:57:22.940 --> 07:57:24.940
Oh

07:57:37.100 --> 07:57:40.140
What's happening why is one of my rooflings down? Where did you go?

07:57:42.860 --> 07:57:44.860
What the heck is this?

07:57:45.820 --> 07:57:50.940
Oh my god, oh, no, that's a freaking refland. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm so

07:57:54.860 --> 07:57:58.700
Doing a bit of acrobatics. Yeah, acrobatics, mate

07:57:59.980 --> 07:58:02.780
Oh, I meant I just hit the wall. I'm punishing the wall

07:58:05.340 --> 07:58:07.340
Okay, okay, okay, okay

07:58:07.740 --> 07:58:09.740
Okay

07:58:11.260 --> 07:58:13.260
Oh

07:58:13.340 --> 07:58:16.380
What's her refland one didn't make it

07:58:18.780 --> 07:58:21.980
I'm trying to find out my room for being too hot and this is what happens

07:58:24.620 --> 07:58:26.380
Okay

07:58:26.380 --> 07:58:28.380
Oh, we've failed him

07:58:28.860 --> 07:58:30.860
We may he rip in this

07:58:31.580 --> 07:58:33.580
He did what you could where you could

07:58:34.540 --> 07:58:36.540
No, we can't win them all we can't win

07:58:37.100 --> 07:58:39.100
It is not possible

07:58:39.820 --> 07:58:41.820
I

07:58:42.380 --> 07:58:47.820
Should someone say my message they're like I fall asleep to your streams more than your ASMR streams and I'm like how

07:58:48.860 --> 07:58:51.500
How do you not completely perish?

07:58:52.380 --> 07:58:54.380
Did I have you?

07:58:55.260 --> 07:58:57.740
Is there any other reflings here? Um

07:58:58.540 --> 07:59:00.540
Wait, this isn't a grave site. I've

07:59:00.700 --> 07:59:02.700
No, it is a grave site

07:59:03.260 --> 07:59:05.580
I think I had you in recently did I not

07:59:06.540 --> 07:59:11.180
Is who are you red mean for you sure

07:59:14.380 --> 07:59:16.380
Uh

07:59:17.020 --> 07:59:20.780
There is as I said, there is probably a possibility we're going back boss time

07:59:22.060 --> 07:59:26.300
Have you already as there are reflings who've already finished all of the deal? I almost dropped off

07:59:27.580 --> 07:59:29.900
Um, have you guys already finished like the DLC?

07:59:30.060 --> 07:59:35.340
Is that no friend that's friendly

07:59:37.180 --> 07:59:39.580
Reflink refling that's another replay

07:59:40.300 --> 07:59:42.300
Reflink that's another replay

07:59:43.180 --> 07:59:46.620
Stop it. That's another replay. Are you not a refling?

07:59:50.620 --> 07:59:57.660
Am I missing something or did I just fall in from that's not a refling? It's an NPC who?

08:00:00.620 --> 08:00:07.660
Oh, no, I wondered why your name was so funny. I was like that's such a specific name refling

08:00:07.740 --> 08:00:12.460
Why you wrote I'm so sorry refling wait. So how did I get rid of her?

08:00:13.660 --> 08:00:14.940
I don't

08:00:14.940 --> 08:00:18.700
Oh my god. Sorry. I'm going to go ahead so you despawn refling. I'm so sorry

08:00:20.540 --> 08:00:24.060
I was so freaking confused at the name. I was like that's such a specific name

08:00:24.140 --> 08:00:26.620
All right. I shouldn't do a cutscene so you don't get pummeled

08:00:27.340 --> 08:00:34.140
Freya hates refling. Oh my god. This bosses effect can well destroy you

08:00:35.740 --> 08:00:39.820
Oh horned beast from higher sphere delivered

08:00:41.340 --> 08:00:45.420
Take root inside the tower sculptor keepers

08:00:46.700 --> 08:00:51.820
And perched within we beg of thee rise

08:00:56.620 --> 08:00:58.620
Oh

08:01:15.020 --> 08:01:17.020
And those who plague the tower

08:01:19.260 --> 08:01:21.740
Lends away the trumpets

08:01:26.620 --> 08:01:28.620
Oh

08:01:40.060 --> 08:01:42.060
Uh

08:01:43.740 --> 08:01:45.740
Where's the first

08:01:48.940 --> 08:01:50.940
Eh

08:01:52.540 --> 08:01:54.540
He has this

08:01:55.500 --> 08:01:57.500
Oh my god

08:02:06.380 --> 08:02:10.620
I have no flash I'm absolutely no help right now

08:02:12.780 --> 08:02:18.060
Uh, you're on your own holy moley

08:02:20.700 --> 08:02:22.700
Uh

08:02:23.660 --> 08:02:25.660
Yeah, um

08:02:28.300 --> 08:02:33.660
I think we need to go back to limb grave. I said it. I don't I don't know what I'm supposed to do

08:02:37.100 --> 08:02:40.540
Isn't there that death plumage thing going on?

08:02:44.460 --> 08:02:48.700
I'm probably gonna perish like in there because of an accident

08:02:53.100 --> 08:02:55.100
Oh

08:02:56.940 --> 08:03:00.860
Wait, why are you locking on to me? I haven't done any damage to you

08:03:03.500 --> 08:03:05.980
I'm trying to look at his attack patterns, but

08:03:07.980 --> 08:03:09.980
Wow

08:03:18.540 --> 08:03:20.540
Oh my god, sorry

08:03:23.100 --> 08:03:25.100
No, there's no way holy

08:03:26.780 --> 08:03:28.780
Holy moley

08:03:29.500 --> 08:03:31.500
Just wait as in

08:03:32.700 --> 08:03:34.700
Implication of

08:03:34.700 --> 08:03:39.020
He filtered so many people. I would not be surprised

08:03:40.140 --> 08:03:43.980
And ignoring the impending doom that's actually pretty decent. He gets harder

08:03:47.260 --> 08:03:49.260
Oh my god

08:03:50.220 --> 08:03:53.500
Okay, we have a real situation on our hands

08:03:54.300 --> 08:03:57.820
I'm too weak to do anything because of my weapon drain stuff

08:03:59.020 --> 08:04:01.020
Do you want

08:04:01.820 --> 08:04:04.620
Reflings do you want to have a whack at it?

08:04:05.420 --> 08:04:09.900
I don't mind you guys have it if you want a whack at it. I do not mind at all

08:04:11.900 --> 08:04:13.900
Or we can go back

08:04:13.980 --> 08:04:21.020
Go get some flasks. Okay, we're going to go back to limb grave and just chill out for a little bit

08:04:21.340 --> 08:04:25.580
Because like this area is definitely getting a bit too much for me

08:04:27.340 --> 08:04:31.180
As for seats and stuff

08:04:32.140 --> 08:04:36.220
Unfortunately, my memory failed me of what ones I've gotten

08:04:37.420 --> 08:04:39.420
For the sake of

08:04:39.500 --> 08:04:41.500
Oh

08:04:45.660 --> 08:04:47.900
Okay, we're just going to take a little chill pill

08:04:48.460 --> 08:04:53.260
We're just going to uh, I want to explore and get like all the maps and stuff if that's okay

08:04:54.060 --> 08:04:56.060
We'll just take it nice and easy

08:04:56.620 --> 08:04:59.100
Nice and easy. Okay. Nice and easy

08:04:59.820 --> 08:05:04.460
Uh, we'll go unlock the map. Um, if you want to come with me, I'm in

08:05:05.180 --> 08:05:10.620
K-Lum ruins and north of K-Lid. Yeah

08:05:15.020 --> 08:05:20.300
Uh, and then I get my little reasons in and we'll just do some explore and get a few flasks and seeds

08:05:21.260 --> 08:05:24.620
Um, not really sure what else to do

08:05:25.980 --> 08:05:27.980
Can't do that from here

08:05:28.940 --> 08:05:30.940
From this one freaking marker

08:05:31.900 --> 08:05:38.940
I've got the game actually going to make me go travel on my own. Does it not know that I'm a streamer princess?

08:05:44.220 --> 08:05:47.820
That map is a separate map. Well, I'm going to go discover the map of this

08:05:50.140 --> 08:05:53.420
Go to summon water village outskirts. I will go there

08:05:54.940 --> 08:05:56.940
Please do not attack

08:05:57.500 --> 08:05:59.500
I do

08:05:59.980 --> 08:06:02.480
Good luck attacking me. No, I'm on the other side of the lake

08:06:04.140 --> 08:06:08.140
Why does it say dragon spiral? I'm gonna get jumped by a dragon

08:06:09.980 --> 08:06:12.700
Please I just want the map of the area. That's all I have

08:06:13.900 --> 08:06:16.780
I'm a simple streamer. There's not much more to it

08:06:18.140 --> 08:06:21.740
Just want the map of the area. I wasn't too far off it

08:06:23.100 --> 08:06:25.820
Nice to be at pin the oh, I found the dragon

08:06:26.540 --> 08:06:28.540
I'll never guess where the dragon is

08:06:30.460 --> 08:06:34.940
Uh, right, okay, we'll discover this map. I actually don't see the map on the close here here

08:06:35.580 --> 08:06:40.540
Okay, um, I am too cool to summon water village, which I

08:06:47.820 --> 08:06:49.820
And the other map

08:06:49.820 --> 08:06:51.820
So

08:06:53.820 --> 08:06:55.820
It's on the other map

08:07:11.020 --> 08:07:13.020
It's in the middle of Lynn grief

08:07:13.820 --> 08:07:15.820
I

08:07:20.380 --> 08:07:22.940
Didn't that took me a whole second. Sorry

08:07:23.660 --> 08:07:29.660
We are going such a girl boss girl princess streamer and she's the basically girl. Oh god

08:07:30.780 --> 08:07:32.780
Honestly, where's where we marker? Oh

08:07:34.140 --> 08:07:37.580
Uh, right. I can summon you guys in here and then we'll

08:07:38.460 --> 08:07:40.460
That

08:07:52.620 --> 08:07:59.020
Oh, I keep doing that. I'm not to bring in the adversary first. Ah, we'll show you. We'll show you. Okay

08:07:59.020 --> 08:08:01.020
Oh

08:08:22.700 --> 08:08:25.420
That's what you're wearing that boss's face

08:08:26.620 --> 08:08:28.620
You're wearing that boss's face

08:08:29.020 --> 08:08:31.740
That we just got absolutely kablamo'd by

08:08:32.700 --> 08:08:37.180
There's a church and a grave and a sacred tear just south-east of here. Okay

08:08:38.540 --> 08:08:41.180
Oh, no, what's wrong little refund. Do you need a nap?

08:08:42.220 --> 08:08:44.220
Are you scared of the enemy?

08:08:44.940 --> 08:08:47.900
What's wrong? Are you caring for a blessing me?

08:08:49.900 --> 08:08:58.140
Uh, is there any other refling and the summon water village outskirts at the north west of kaolin or limb grief?

08:08:59.100 --> 08:09:01.100
What are you holding?

08:09:12.300 --> 08:09:14.300
No, not that one this one

08:09:14.620 --> 08:09:19.900
For some reason there's no other symbol showing up. So there's only one logical thing to do one slam

08:09:20.060 --> 08:09:22.060
Um

08:09:23.580 --> 08:09:24.620
Okay

08:09:24.620 --> 08:09:31.180
Ray let's get into it. I don't know why there's not any more symbols showing up the game's a bit finicky

08:09:31.340 --> 08:09:36.060
But let's see if we can hold our own and limb grave flash kaolin

08:09:50.300 --> 08:09:52.300
Calling the reef

08:09:59.820 --> 08:10:03.820
Oh, he did a jump jump, okay

08:10:05.740 --> 08:10:10.620
And a jump and a jump and a jump

08:10:12.460 --> 08:10:14.460
Yahoo

We did it a jelly. Did you make it? Yeah, see look who's really MLG pro out here

08:10:22.460 --> 08:10:24.940
Can you watch over a certain goddess if she's demon?

08:10:25.820 --> 08:10:30.460
I knew she was doing drunk buckshot roulette. Sure. I or dining messenger on

08:10:30.460 --> 08:10:32.460

Meet the girls do not enter out to me refling time. Also me even there's something up with a girl. Uh, uh, uh

08:10:48.300 --> 08:10:50.540
Okay, I can't reach that. I'm too small. That's okay

08:10:51.980 --> 08:10:53.980
I'm used to being small so

08:10:55.180 --> 08:10:57.180
Take it where you're hidden

08:10:57.740 --> 08:11:03.260

Okay, I trust you guys and your judgment. I don't know ha ha funny streamer. It was but health first

Oh that boar's charging you

08:12:37.100 --> 08:12:39.100
Me and the boar are charging me

08:12:39.660 --> 08:12:46.220
I have funny streamer. That's basically the only way I can do it is like so, you know, it's like a streamer does a drunk stream

08:12:47.340 --> 08:12:50.140
And it's like the cute drunk and like oh, they're having a good time

08:12:50.140 --> 08:12:56.460
They're giggling they're laughing they're singing or whatever and then there's like the other drunk time when you're like, oh my god

08:12:57.500 --> 08:13:01.740
I this doesn't feel good like watching this I feel nervous, you know

08:13:02.700 --> 08:13:04.700
I

08:13:06.460 --> 08:13:17.180
Crystal tear and a wondrous physics. Oh, I never even had that on mall. I understand now why I was getting asked about the physics

08:13:19.340 --> 08:13:26.300
Okay, is it like a sad drunk streamer like yeah, I only got two beers and about eight ounces the camera has it done

08:13:27.580 --> 08:13:29.580
Don't overdo it

08:13:29.660 --> 08:13:32.380
Oh, wow and a sacred tear

08:13:35.340 --> 08:13:37.340
Oh wait, but here's a leafling here

08:13:38.460 --> 08:13:40.460
The perfume alone

08:13:42.620 --> 08:13:44.620
I swear if I just brought in

08:13:45.180 --> 08:13:47.980
An mpc again because I'm so dumb and I can't tell the difference

08:13:49.980 --> 08:13:54.860
If you kill Kenneth, he gives a golden key. Do I want to kill whoever this Kenneth is?

08:13:54.860 --> 08:14:04.220
Or should I be worried did I just call in an mpc again? I was gonna say the name looks so formal and specific

08:14:04.780 --> 08:14:06.780
uh

08:14:07.420 --> 08:14:09.420
Oh, no

08:14:09.500 --> 08:14:15.980
You're not an mpc at all. No, definitely not an mpc with this uh with this arrangement

08:14:17.340 --> 08:14:19.900
Oh, do you want do you want it to rival leaflin?

08:14:20.540 --> 08:14:22.540
You want to join in

08:14:22.540 --> 08:14:24.540
Are you good nah you joining

08:14:25.100 --> 08:14:27.100
No, that's definitely blue. Yeah

08:14:28.060 --> 08:14:30.060
You're cowering

08:14:31.180 --> 08:14:35.260
Oh, why did that all walk on you that actually like went for you

08:14:37.660 --> 08:14:39.660
Okay, let's go again

08:14:42.220 --> 08:14:44.220
He's just good at blending in true

08:14:48.460 --> 08:14:54.220
Wow, I'm using up a stamina bar because the game thinks I'm fighting you the invader

08:14:55.580 --> 08:14:57.580
She's shocking behavior

08:15:08.140 --> 08:15:15.660
Forget Lumbridge we adventuring through a limb break. Okay, that did not work at all. I thought that rhymed a bit better in my head

08:15:15.660 --> 08:15:17.660
I

08:15:23.580 --> 08:15:26.380
May have to make a cup of tea for my wee voice shortly

08:15:28.460 --> 08:15:30.460
Even though I just ate

08:15:31.180 --> 08:15:35.260
My voice is starting to feel it. Okay. I've been rambling your ears off for how long

08:15:36.140 --> 08:15:38.140
Eight hours already. Wow

08:15:39.580 --> 08:15:41.900
I'm sorry, but you guys make the same part with one

08:15:42.700 --> 08:15:44.700
I say, oh, what do you think of elder drink?

08:15:46.220 --> 08:15:50.460
Oh, it's really good if you play it with friends and play with friends. What do you mean?

08:15:51.580 --> 08:15:58.700
I'm like, oh, I got carried through the entire game carry. What do you what do you mean characters intact? Oh, um

08:16:00.060 --> 08:16:02.060
Yeah, I kind of just

08:16:03.420 --> 08:16:04.380
Yeah

08:16:04.380 --> 08:16:06.060
10 out of 10 game wait

08:16:06.060 --> 08:16:10.380
So if you played it solo, what's your rate and oh I can still appreciate the game and all that

08:16:10.540 --> 08:16:12.540
But I'm too scared as a player

08:16:12.780 --> 08:16:18.940
But the actual game itself is still 10 out of 10. There's fantastic art and direction and narrative and everything

08:16:20.300 --> 08:16:24.780
Just found my xp form spot need to take a detail my weapon is not strong enough

08:16:25.340 --> 08:16:32.460
I can relate to that my weapon is although it's a dlc weapon. So maybe I'm like overpowered for limb grave now

08:16:35.340 --> 08:16:37.340
Caleb and all that

08:16:38.220 --> 08:16:43.260
The fact you guys can remember where like these sacred flasks and tears are

08:16:45.100 --> 08:16:47.900
Look at fast from running. I like speedy gonzales

08:16:52.780 --> 08:16:58.140
I never played it you've never played it before wait, why are you tolerating me playing at this?

08:17:00.380 --> 08:17:04.860
I guess soul's game doesn't for everyone like I have to be honest. I've never played any other soul's game

08:17:05.740 --> 08:17:07.260
um

08:17:07.900 --> 08:17:13.660
And I actually don't think I could even play this game on stream if it wasn't for the fact that you guys can come help me

08:17:14.300 --> 08:17:19.500
Like it is not possible. It's not possible. I cannot do this on my own and get too scared

08:17:20.140 --> 08:17:24.460
Too scared. I want I want uh friendly. I want help. I want everything

08:17:26.460 --> 08:17:28.460
Because I like you

08:17:28.700 --> 08:17:32.060
But like to tolerate like such an endurance stream of a game

08:17:32.620 --> 08:17:34.620
I feel like

08:17:34.780 --> 08:17:37.740
Right there one dead here. Wow

08:17:39.260 --> 08:17:45.660
Oh, I remember what we're doing. There's a piece of a half up here. Are we going inside the castello?

08:17:47.420 --> 08:17:49.420
Sorry, mate. I won this time

08:17:51.100 --> 08:17:55.100
Elden ring is just the backdrop for the yap stream

08:17:57.100 --> 08:17:59.100
How does she do it leaving jump?

08:18:00.060 --> 08:18:06.780
Oh, I'm getting sleepy because I've eaten. I'm not sorry. I'm doing an endurance stream

08:18:08.220 --> 08:18:10.220
I'm not gonna bed

08:18:10.860 --> 08:18:12.860
I need to get endurance

08:18:12.860 --> 08:18:14.860
because

08:18:15.420 --> 08:18:18.940
If I don't then I'm in big trouble big trouble

08:18:21.260 --> 08:18:23.260
What's going on in here?

08:18:24.140 --> 08:18:32.460
We things together strong. It's not normal to watch someone when you play the game

08:18:33.660 --> 08:18:37.180
You love play a game you don't like. I don't know. I just feel like

08:18:38.060 --> 08:18:41.420
Oh, that game doesn't interest me. I won't watch it type thing

08:18:42.300 --> 08:18:47.020
I'm like, I'm not that entertaining. Oh my god. You just did that for me. Thank you

08:18:47.100 --> 08:18:51.820
I just got that ash reward even though I didn't do anything so

08:18:53.260 --> 08:18:55.260
I'm getting a lot of blood roses around here

08:18:56.060 --> 08:18:58.940
But we watch for you know, you're gonna stop. Oh my god

08:19:00.620 --> 08:19:02.620
Can't say such things to me

08:19:03.260 --> 08:19:06.380
You can't be so nice to me. You'll make me too happy

08:19:07.260 --> 08:19:11.420
What happens if I get an ego because of how um kind you guys are?

08:19:13.660 --> 08:19:16.940
Okay, I'm picking up this half is this for the all

08:19:19.340 --> 08:19:22.620

08:19:23.820 --> 08:19:25.420
Oops

08:19:25.420 --> 08:19:27.420
Hello

08:19:28.620 --> 08:19:34.140
Okay, that was lucky. I don't I thought that was a lot closer than it was

08:19:42.060 --> 08:19:44.460
Sorry, I was doing where are we going?

08:19:44.460 --> 08:19:46.460
I

08:19:47.660 --> 08:19:51.420
When you're eager to be so flustered get an ego use it to crush ours

08:19:51.900 --> 08:19:55.180
I don't want to crush your ego. I want to crush your pelvis. Yeah

08:19:55.660 --> 08:19:57.820
I don't want to crush your ego though

08:19:57.820 --> 08:20:02.460
Like sometimes it's good to be selfish and like confident and all that is um

08:20:03.580 --> 08:20:05.580
Isn't it so bad to be confident in yourself?

08:20:09.500 --> 08:20:12.780
My lord talk about in dream stream after I went to work and came back and you're still here

08:20:13.180 --> 08:20:15.180
Did you have a good day at work?

08:20:16.220 --> 08:20:19.900
Did you remember to hydrate did you remember to do your

08:20:20.460 --> 08:20:21.820
After work

08:20:21.820 --> 08:20:26.860
Jobby for 45 minutes in the toilet like that's all I see about on tiktok

08:20:27.900 --> 08:20:29.900
Is all these chicks are like

08:20:30.060 --> 08:20:34.940
Oh my man comes back to work and he takes a 45 minute in the toilet

08:20:35.660 --> 08:20:37.660
and everyone's like

08:20:38.540 --> 08:20:41.900
I don't know if you've ever been on the the female side of tiktok

08:20:42.060 --> 08:20:48.620
It is the most bizarre experience of your life because without fail the comments are leave him

08:20:50.140 --> 08:20:54.380
It's bizarre. It doesn't matter what the context of the video might be

08:20:54.700 --> 08:20:58.220
There's always one chick in the comments that goes leave them

08:20:59.740 --> 08:21:02.700
And it was like what where did they even come from?

08:21:03.180 --> 08:21:09.020
So, yeah, stay if you if your brain was on tiktok the chick side of it is bizarre. I'm sorry

08:21:10.380 --> 08:21:17.100
You've never thought I you I used entirely the wrong phrase. I meant get an eagle use it to crush our minds bad typing

08:21:17.340 --> 08:21:19.340
I mean either way we got something's getting crushed

08:21:22.220 --> 08:21:26.060
And it's not the can the central bank of

08:21:27.580 --> 08:21:29.580
Texas

08:21:33.420 --> 08:21:34.940
Oh

08:21:34.940 --> 08:21:40.300
Did you guys forget the joke already someone said central bank of texas and

08:21:40.940 --> 08:21:47.340
The acronym reminded them of something. Oh, it happened a couple of hours ago now. Like sorry that you guys don't remember. Okay

08:21:48.460 --> 08:21:50.460
sorry

08:21:51.260 --> 08:21:54.380
Only people have been here from the very start understood any of that

08:21:55.980 --> 08:21:57.980
I take a

08:21:58.620 --> 08:22:07.180
Boss makes a dollar. I make a dime. That's why I take job beyond company time. Exactly as intended. So I'm gonna pay exactly

08:22:09.580 --> 08:22:14.540
CBO too. What's the acronym central bank texas?

08:22:15.980 --> 08:22:17.980
um

08:22:18.620 --> 08:22:20.620
Oh, there's a bear

08:22:21.260 --> 08:22:23.260
I

08:22:25.020 --> 08:22:28.620
Mean as long as the bears. Oh my god, it's a ojisan in the wild

08:22:30.220 --> 08:22:34.380
Okay, we got the map. That's fantastic. We're the heck Harvey. Okay, we're right down here

08:22:36.220 --> 08:22:38.220
I'm following the reason

08:22:39.340 --> 08:22:43.260
How many times would you be depositing them with drawing will at the

08:22:44.300 --> 08:22:49.020
central bank of texas? I don't even know what we're trying to do with the euphemism

08:22:51.180 --> 08:22:54.060
Okay, but I don't get it. English isn't my first one. Um

08:22:56.060 --> 08:22:58.060
CBT

08:22:59.980 --> 08:23:03.660
Is uh acronym for

08:23:07.820 --> 08:23:12.060
Hold on, let me pick up these flowers like when a woman

08:23:13.580 --> 08:23:15.580
And a man get together

08:23:16.620 --> 08:23:19.420
And the man has two boiled eggs on them

08:23:20.940 --> 08:23:23.740
And then she will she like steps on her

08:23:24.300 --> 08:23:27.660
On the eggs and he goes hey, those are my eggs

08:23:28.060 --> 08:23:31.740
But instead of feeling sad about her stepping on his eggs

08:23:33.020 --> 08:23:36.780
His he he he's like he he enjoys it

08:23:39.820 --> 08:23:43.340
Rock and ball torture. Oh my god, then most of you're gonna have to forgive me

08:23:44.300 --> 08:23:46.700
I swear but most of every time you see me alive

08:23:46.700 --> 08:23:52.300
You must your eyes must rule out of your skull being like she said she's gonna do this goddamn

08:23:52.780 --> 08:23:56.380
ASMR collab and then you see me sitting streaming for 12 hours

08:23:58.060 --> 08:24:03.180
Honestly, I'd be fed up of myself. So don't worry if you ever feel fed up towards me

08:24:10.700 --> 08:24:12.300
Uh

08:24:12.300 --> 08:24:16.300
I will never forgive you stony bad girl bad girl honestly

08:24:16.860 --> 08:24:18.860
Jiki jiki

She's just sitting in the villa streaming literally

08:24:23.180 --> 08:24:25.180
Mamosa refland

08:24:25.260 --> 08:24:29.100
Don't you guys forget that one of us one of us one of us

08:24:31.260 --> 08:24:33.260
Are we about to the beat of the game?

08:24:34.220 --> 08:24:35.900
I don't know

08:24:35.900 --> 08:24:41.180
There is a limited amount of flasks in the world. I have no idea what they're going

08:24:41.740 --> 08:24:47.740
Ooh the rocks are floating. Whose connection is that? Is that my connection or his connection?

08:24:50.540 --> 08:24:52.540
Must be

08:24:52.860 --> 08:24:56.220
Okay, it's your connection because you're a stan moment

08:24:58.540 --> 08:25:01.420
She has a membership too. That's when you know that's when you know

08:25:03.100 --> 08:25:05.100
Me who doesn't have a membership to Mamosa

08:25:07.260 --> 08:25:08.860
Smile

08:25:08.860 --> 08:25:10.860
Ah these sheep

Stony you can step on my egg. Am I allowed?

08:25:15.180 --> 08:25:17.500
Are you going for it? Oh, he's going for it

08:25:21.660 --> 08:25:23.660
Is he gonna let me do it?

08:25:25.900 --> 08:25:29.980
Oh my god, wait, why do you guys do such a whack and I don't

08:25:30.700 --> 08:25:34.780
Oh wait, hold on two-handed hold y right bumper to two-handed. Okay

08:25:35.980 --> 08:25:37.980

08:25:38.220 --> 08:25:40.220
Oh, I know you've blown a horn. Whoa

08:25:42.940 --> 08:25:47.740
Okay, there's something in here. I'll let you guys fight. We'll start discover what is in the back of this carriage

08:25:48.300 --> 08:25:51.340
It's a great axe. Okay, we'll be honest. Don't think we need a great axe

08:25:52.140 --> 08:25:55.100
Not monetized queen soon though. Soon TM

08:25:56.380 --> 08:25:58.380
Soon TM

08:25:58.540 --> 08:26:00.540
You'll get there

08:26:01.500 --> 08:26:03.500
Oh

08:26:07.820 --> 08:26:09.820
Okay, we follow the torch

08:26:10.380 --> 08:26:13.740
We use our eyeballs and follow the torch. Why yes, of course

08:26:14.460 --> 08:26:17.740
It's really just an okay axe and my axe

08:26:19.020 --> 08:26:21.020
You have my bear

08:26:21.100 --> 08:26:23.100
under my axe

08:26:23.820 --> 08:26:25.820
Thank you

08:26:26.620 --> 08:26:30.140
Wait a minute. I think you're not my friend

08:26:36.060 --> 08:26:44.460
I'm muted and I and the OBS studio shows you if you're making a sound or not while muted

08:26:45.980 --> 08:26:48.860
I in the microphone heard it. It would have been over

08:26:49.740 --> 08:26:56.220
I've mained and my tentacle. That's the same you guys are have mained in

08:26:57.500 --> 08:27:01.340
How you doing it? Honestly, I have to admit this is gonna sound really weird

08:27:01.420 --> 08:27:06.700
It's actually really funny and like a dog errands. I don't have to think or do anything. I'm just happy to be here

08:27:07.820 --> 08:27:13.980
Like this is so fun. I'm just like talking away. Blip. Blip. Blip. Blip. Blip. And I was like, oh, and you raise it. Oh, and you

08:27:14.620 --> 08:27:16.620
Flask, oh, oh this, oh that

08:27:17.580 --> 08:27:21.980
Stony season's ended like her full name in a trance. What does that mean?

08:27:26.220 --> 08:27:28.220
We've done a momo shirt to bring this

08:27:30.220 --> 08:27:32.220
Uh

08:27:32.460 --> 08:27:38.620
What castle and flowers. Sorry. I got distracted by the pretty flowers. Tee hee. Honest to say

08:27:39.980 --> 08:27:42.540
Is this where the last piece is?

08:27:43.500 --> 08:27:46.620
The bench between asleep people

08:27:47.900 --> 08:27:50.780
Handholding is the most fun and best way literally

08:27:51.820 --> 08:27:54.460
You said it was a noise that you wouldn't want us to hear. No

08:27:55.740 --> 08:27:57.740
You're not allowed

08:27:59.020 --> 08:28:04.220
Because once you do it, you can never go back once you brap you can never unbrap

08:28:08.540 --> 08:28:11.660
Honestly for me, it's not that serious that really

08:28:12.940 --> 08:28:14.940
What

08:28:17.180 --> 08:28:19.180
Wait

08:28:20.140 --> 08:28:22.140
Why can't I progress?

08:28:25.180 --> 08:28:31.500
They're going for it. I can't progress. Why would I need you guys not to be here? I'm about to do another boss fight

08:28:32.460 --> 08:28:34.460
I bet or not

08:28:37.100 --> 08:28:41.180
It's the wall again, I can't believe it three year old be sure to hit the wall at three year old

08:28:42.140 --> 08:28:44.140
What no refling you can

08:28:55.980 --> 08:28:57.980
Because you're crossing a boom boundary

08:28:59.340 --> 08:29:01.340
Uh

08:29:03.900 --> 08:29:08.780
Uh, I'm gonna get on torrent. I don't trust this at all

08:29:11.580 --> 08:29:13.580
There's a thing right

08:29:15.180 --> 08:29:18.060
Can I wait can I just summon you guys like right here?

08:29:19.580 --> 08:29:25.980
I can so why did it even make you this with the because it's like a new loaded area? That's

08:29:26.540 --> 08:29:28.700
Pretty plausible explanation

08:29:29.420 --> 08:29:31.420
That it's a new load in area

08:29:32.700 --> 08:29:36.380
Grass ahead no enemies. He was just a wee fellow

08:29:37.100 --> 08:29:38.940
Oh

08:29:38.940 --> 08:29:42.700
Yeah, background load in shenanigans. Okay. I understand that then that makes sense

08:29:43.580 --> 08:29:49.340
Because if it wasn't then I'm angry because I want maybe something but if not, then fame

08:29:49.900 --> 08:29:54.380
I'll allow it to get there. I'm gonna do a little cheeky little cheeky head and load in the screen

08:29:55.500 --> 08:29:57.500
Um

08:29:59.020 --> 08:30:01.020
I love

08:30:01.740 --> 08:30:05.340
Yeah, it's just new can any other leaflings come in

08:30:08.460 --> 08:30:10.460
Or is it because of something too far so doesn't

08:30:11.980 --> 08:30:15.580
I don't mean to be an adversary, but I'm gonna need some help. Okay. I'm gonna need some backup

08:30:17.740 --> 08:30:20.380
I'm wondering I think I'm gonna be honest

08:30:20.460 --> 08:30:23.580
I think a lot of people might just sleep or they can't stream

08:30:24.860 --> 08:30:27.580
Because the before the pool was massive

08:30:28.300 --> 08:30:35.820
But you guys are allowed to break okay, he's don't ever feel bad if you like can't join me or can't get in or anything like that

08:30:39.900 --> 08:30:41.900
Hmm

08:30:42.860 --> 08:30:48.060
You can stream snake. I keep putting my sign down, but does that show up? Hmm

08:30:50.140 --> 08:30:55.020
Sorry, I'm addicted to playing the dlc. Honestly, maybe if there's leaflings that are playing the dlc

08:30:55.180 --> 08:30:58.460
Maybe that's wiser for when we go back to the dlc

08:30:59.100 --> 08:31:05.580
I actually don't mind that concept. So maybe keep going ahead for me if that's possible

08:31:08.300 --> 08:31:11.500
Yeah, the further you go because the difficulty gap is getting massive

08:31:11.740 --> 08:31:18.380
Okay, no, don't worry about joining. Please don't worry like we just been chilling. Don't you want being chilling?

08:31:19.340 --> 08:31:27.580
Are you all red so I can spot you? Okay, let's go

08:31:31.020 --> 08:31:35.260
Oh, I need the blessing. I forget every time that I need to bless you guys when you come in

08:31:37.660 --> 08:31:39.660
Do you have to lie down?

08:31:40.700 --> 08:31:42.700
Okay ready steady

08:31:45.260 --> 08:31:47.260
And I've led you into temptation

08:31:49.340 --> 08:31:54.540
Wow hold y bumper 200

08:31:56.300 --> 08:31:59.580
Pretty sure I just beat the main part of the dlc. So we'll be good. Okay

08:32:01.100 --> 08:32:03.100
Yeah, we didn't some exploring

08:32:03.340 --> 08:32:09.900
Is level 42 anywhere enough to help you um in where I am? Yes, actually. Hello

08:32:11.660 --> 08:32:13.340
Hello

08:32:13.340 --> 08:32:15.340
Is somebody there? Yes me?

08:32:16.620 --> 08:32:18.620
Yeah, of course. My name is arena

08:32:19.180 --> 08:32:21.580
I've escaped from castle mooring to the south

08:32:22.380 --> 08:32:24.380
Servants there have rebelled

08:32:24.540 --> 08:32:25.740
I

08:32:25.740 --> 08:32:27.740
I can't be sure what it is

08:32:27.820 --> 08:32:33.580
My eyesight's been weak since birth, you see, but I swear I heard frightful howling from all over

08:32:34.140 --> 08:32:38.540
My good father secreted me at the castle, but decided himself to stay

08:32:39.740 --> 08:32:41.740
He says it's his duty

08:32:42.220 --> 08:32:44.220
As commander

08:32:44.860 --> 08:32:47.740
The accent sounds familiar. Is that a ba we know?

08:32:48.940 --> 08:32:50.220
I

08:32:50.220 --> 08:32:52.220
I fear for father's life

08:32:52.300 --> 08:32:54.300
The servants are full wrath

08:32:54.780 --> 08:32:59.980
Filled with hatred for every one of us. They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with

08:33:00.700 --> 08:33:05.340
They haven't spared a soul. I fear it's no different at castle mooring. Please

08:33:06.060 --> 08:33:07.420
I implore you

08:33:07.420 --> 08:33:09.420
Would you mind taking a letter to my father

08:33:10.140 --> 08:33:12.860
At the castle and my soul wishes that he escaped

08:33:13.740 --> 08:33:16.300
Even if his honor should be the price, please

08:33:17.660 --> 08:33:19.660
I just want him to be safe

08:33:20.620 --> 08:33:23.020
Of the region I'll deliver the layer

08:33:24.300 --> 08:33:26.300
Dearly then please

08:33:26.940 --> 08:33:30.220
Take this. Yeah, we'll deliver a letter. Come on. Let's go. Okay

08:33:30.300 --> 08:33:36.060
Deliver it to my father who remains in the castle if you please. Yeah, sure Ray. Let's go find your dad

08:33:37.020 --> 08:33:39.180
The castle's done here. What are you?

08:33:40.780 --> 08:33:44.060
Are you spelling out a word or is this just a pose in particular?

08:33:45.100 --> 08:33:51.100
She needs some yummy grapes. Don't think so. I mean like the regional accent, but I can't put my finger on it

08:33:51.980 --> 08:33:54.540
Um, a lot of the voices are actually Welsh

08:33:55.420 --> 08:33:58.700
Um, I'm hearing Welsh voices a lot in this game

08:33:59.900 --> 08:34:04.300
Um, which is nice. You don't really get to hear the Welsh accent at all

08:34:04.380 --> 08:34:07.980
It's kind of like one of those forgotten accents. It's very strong

08:34:10.300 --> 08:34:12.300
Very very strong

08:34:13.020 --> 08:34:15.020
Wait, does he not even attack?

08:34:15.180 --> 08:34:17.180
I'm gonna have to get that pose

08:34:19.900 --> 08:34:21.900
Uh, this should be re-grapes

08:34:23.660 --> 08:34:25.660
Are they nutrition?

08:34:25.820 --> 08:34:27.820
They're looking for me here

08:34:28.460 --> 08:34:31.660
A morning star and it's literally, uh

08:34:32.620 --> 08:34:34.620
Jack is me

08:34:42.220 --> 08:34:44.220
I think I

08:34:44.860 --> 08:34:47.740
Yeah, believe it's a Welsh pronunciation. Oh blaz

08:34:52.540 --> 08:34:54.860
Am I beating this up fucking come here

08:34:56.060 --> 08:34:57.340
Take this

08:34:57.340 --> 08:34:59.340
No, you're gonna win

08:34:59.340 --> 08:35:04.860
I've got matey shot. I don't think I've ever seen a crossbow run of this game. I'm gonna be honest

08:35:07.500 --> 08:35:12.940
It's an I've never seen it if you read the description of weapons and gear these things have a wee hidden buff as well

08:35:13.580 --> 08:35:15.580
Honestly, don't mind buzz

08:35:17.100 --> 08:35:19.260
Let me grab this little phone ring here

08:35:20.060 --> 08:35:24.540
The morning star can get you after every hit. It can heal you after every hit

08:35:24.700 --> 08:35:32.060
Uh, if my memory serves me correct, there's a horse guy that's ready to attack behind this

08:35:33.020 --> 08:35:36.860
Uh, bang. Do you have any stone? You do. I'm sorry to see

08:35:38.540 --> 08:35:40.540
Do you have anything else that we use?

08:35:43.820 --> 08:35:45.820
I guess if you want to do like a hundred percent

08:35:46.620 --> 08:35:48.620
Collection, uh being interesting

08:35:49.740 --> 08:35:52.460
I mean, I have so many souls I can just buy out the shot

08:35:54.940 --> 08:35:56.940
I

08:35:57.660 --> 08:36:00.460
Only at night they're called night riders. Okay, we're safe for now

08:36:03.420 --> 08:36:05.420
I do love a good hidden status

08:36:06.220 --> 08:36:07.500
It's kind of like

08:36:07.500 --> 08:36:14.140
Um, I don't know if you guys have ever played this game called darkest dungeon. I've never managed to finish it always gets stuck

08:36:14.860 --> 08:36:21.020
But I've always thoroughly enjoyed the game when I've played it for like my two hours before getting absolutely gridlocked

08:36:21.500 --> 08:36:23.500
I'm just stuck at it

08:36:23.980 --> 08:36:29.980
The game's like, oh your characters are supposed to die. Don't worry about it. And I'm like

08:36:31.100 --> 08:36:33.580
But if they die, how am I supposed to progress?

08:36:34.860 --> 08:36:37.500
Because like they're my strongest character type thing

08:36:38.380 --> 08:36:41.500
And I just find it really hard and like, I know

08:36:42.220 --> 08:36:46.860
I don't know if I should like mod it or get or if you guys want to vulture it

08:36:46.860 --> 08:36:51.500
You guys tell me like the best thing to do. I'd probably need to watch a YouTube tutorial though

08:36:52.460 --> 08:36:59.820
On it because I wouldn't want to play a stream game that I completely mess up like I kind of learned my lesson not to be silly

08:37:00.220 --> 08:37:01.420
and

08:37:01.420 --> 08:37:06.940
I was like picking a game that like I have my doubts that I'd enjoy and then play it anyway like

08:37:07.420 --> 08:37:09.900
Boutro was interesting because I could hear a shot

08:37:10.460 --> 08:37:15.260
And like it just went amazing like I genuinely cannot wait to play Boutro with you guys again

08:37:15.740 --> 08:37:19.420
Um, and it was like so nice being able to be like, is this the right move?

08:37:19.500 --> 08:37:24.140
Yeah, no, that's the right move. Like don't don't worry about it. You're doing great. Like that was so lovely

08:37:24.780 --> 08:37:26.780
I'll really enjoy that

08:37:27.020 --> 08:37:32.460
And like I love how you guys are like so non-judgmental about how dumb I can be. Is that a church back there?

08:37:35.420 --> 08:37:41.340
I think I'll need to oh these things won't happen here. Have I been here? No, I haven't been here

08:37:45.500 --> 08:37:48.620
Have you thought any more of them? No, we backed off

08:37:49.500 --> 08:37:53.180
Unfortunately, I've come back because I need to upgrade my my

08:37:54.060 --> 08:38:00.060
flasks and pouches and stuff because I'm just at a terrible just truly in wholeheartedly terrible

08:38:01.820 --> 08:38:03.180
Um

08:38:03.180 --> 08:38:08.620
So we're now back in the limb group area. We're just hunting for sacred tears for seeds

08:38:09.260 --> 08:38:11.260
Just so I can get a few more pouches

08:38:12.220 --> 08:38:19.340
Because I am basically getting completely princess carried. I have not done one proper thing

08:38:20.300 --> 08:38:27.740
Like on my own. I genuinely haven't. We've been here since the moment in and I wouldn't have it any other way

08:38:27.900 --> 08:38:32.300
I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm literally going. I feel like a dog on a walk

08:38:32.780 --> 08:38:37.580
That just gets to have all the excitement of showing up at the destination like oh, what are we doing now?

08:38:37.980 --> 08:38:39.980
Oh, that's lovely. Okay, let's go

08:38:40.860 --> 08:38:42.860
That is exactly what you want

08:38:44.300 --> 08:38:46.300
You sold a guy in the belfry

08:38:47.340 --> 08:38:48.620
well

08:38:48.620 --> 08:38:54.380
That's debatable considering how many levels I got shoved up to thanks to rieflings

08:38:55.020 --> 08:38:58.540
putting all their stonk. There's there's soul stonks into me

08:38:59.980 --> 08:39:01.980
and

08:39:02.220 --> 08:39:05.740
Donna Donna has some darkest dungeon mechanic and it's a colorful

08:39:06.700 --> 08:39:08.380
alternative version

08:39:08.460 --> 08:39:10.460
and the streamer mode has

08:39:11.820 --> 08:39:13.820
That survived on youtube

08:39:14.860 --> 08:39:18.300
It's very strange what things will fly and not fly

08:39:19.020 --> 08:39:23.980
Like one game would do it with a different art style and it's fine. But another game is like not as to work

08:39:25.500 --> 08:39:31.580
Um, it really is this massive great area at the moment, which is a shame because like I'm sure

08:39:32.300 --> 08:39:36.220
Now obviously company wants to make money, but that show people behind it

08:39:36.780 --> 08:39:42.300
I'm sure like they never want their the people that create content to ever be unsure

08:39:43.180 --> 08:39:44.940
of what the rules are

08:39:44.940 --> 08:39:46.940
like the people behind the scenes that actually

08:39:47.420 --> 08:39:52.620
care about like creators and like I understand like hey, this is your income source. This is serious like

08:39:53.340 --> 08:39:55.660
um, obviously as there is just on her

08:39:57.100 --> 08:40:01.820
Monetization celebration stream. Hopefully it went well actually. I had no idea how it went because you know

08:40:02.780 --> 08:40:07.260
I've been going crazy over here for a little bit. Um, but like

08:40:08.620 --> 08:40:11.740
Basically azura got rejected for monetization

08:40:12.620 --> 08:40:17.660
But youtube now has an appeal system in place and we appealed it and to my surprise

08:40:18.300 --> 08:40:21.980
They monetize her and now she has an like an income source now. She

08:40:22.620 --> 08:40:28.140
Is like genuinely like a full content creator now. She has an income source. She has these avenues like

08:40:28.860 --> 08:40:35.900
But if youtube denied it then like azura can't even like plan to move out at all like she just has the

08:40:36.700 --> 08:40:41.980
She would have had to wait a whole other month like type thing. So I have to admit there are doing changes in that

08:40:42.460 --> 08:40:44.460
Like I don't hate

08:40:44.940 --> 08:40:47.980
YouTube as a whole because it is a good platform

08:40:48.860 --> 08:40:51.740
It discover abilities really good as well

08:40:52.140 --> 08:40:56.060
Not for a live stream discover ability of the live streamer isn't good

08:40:56.300 --> 08:41:03.020
But if you produce alternative content like asmr short for example that discover ability is so valuable

08:41:03.100 --> 08:41:08.940
Whereas if you want to compare it to like switch for example, it's just no the same like it's just not hanging

08:41:09.980 --> 08:41:17.340
Very uh uncharacteristic of youtube too much alleviation. Well, actually I was like, um

08:41:18.300 --> 08:41:24.140
Uh azura's goobies are like what stopped her but the problem was her appeal rejection

08:41:24.700 --> 08:41:26.700
actually didn't mention

08:41:27.100 --> 08:41:29.100
actually gratifying content

08:41:29.900 --> 08:41:31.500
um

08:41:31.500 --> 08:41:37.340
So I was like wait, this must be a mistake then because when youtube don't actually give a reason

08:41:39.580 --> 08:41:41.580
I don't know if it's possible

08:41:41.660 --> 08:41:45.980
We got reviewed like her channel got reviewed by someone that doesn't like anime

08:41:46.940 --> 08:41:49.740
Look, I wouldn't be surprised it's plausible

08:41:50.220 --> 08:41:57.260
And but the appeal went through that's the main thing azura now has a another income source on top of patreon on top of uwu market

08:41:57.740 --> 08:41:59.260
and

08:41:59.260 --> 08:42:06.220
And hopefully there'll be something else. How do you guys remember where the churches are literally straight led me straight to a church

08:42:06.220 --> 08:42:08.220
I don't know how you do that

08:42:09.660 --> 08:42:15.420
Is this like when I'm like here's all the strats in viva finata you guys like here's all the strats in elden ring

08:42:15.980 --> 08:42:17.980
I don't know how you do that

08:42:18.300 --> 08:42:20.300
Oh, they're on the map. Oh

08:42:21.980 --> 08:42:23.980
Another sacred tear

08:42:25.340 --> 08:42:32.700
Everyone should be monetized. Yes, everyone is monetized officially on youtube. Um, I think uh

08:42:34.060 --> 08:42:36.060
Management are gonna do like

08:42:37.740 --> 08:42:40.620
About it at some point, but I'll definitely like

08:42:41.580 --> 08:42:44.700
Oh my god, congrats girls like pat them all on the back like

08:42:45.660 --> 08:42:47.660
Yeah, they did it. They did it

08:42:48.060 --> 08:42:50.060
There's steps to being a content creator

08:42:50.940 --> 08:42:53.900
Sorry, I feel time content creator. Oh that yellow fish

08:42:54.940 --> 08:42:56.940
Wait, where we going?

08:42:57.180 --> 08:42:59.180
Do we know

08:42:59.660 --> 08:43:01.660
Follow the light

08:43:02.620 --> 08:43:04.940
It's just like you in Assassin's Creed brotherhood really impressive

08:43:04.940 --> 08:43:06.860
So you just shoot off all that info about the game

08:43:06.860 --> 08:43:10.940
Okay, I'll take it that way then because I'm like there's no way on earth

08:43:11.020 --> 08:43:16.140
I could remember where the locations or churches are that have sacred tears inside

08:43:17.420 --> 08:43:20.140
Her voice is so good. They thought it wasn't real

08:43:20.620 --> 08:43:24.780
Literally, I had to write the cringiest script for her. Maybe she'll find it funny

08:43:25.260 --> 08:43:30.060
Um, and we could like show it on twitter or something because uh, zura is such a good sport

08:43:30.140 --> 08:43:34.940
Like she's so down for anything. I'll like suggest something to her and she's like, yeah. Yeah

08:43:35.580 --> 08:43:39.180
I like she's so that is such a good sport. Fantastic. Um

08:43:39.740 --> 08:43:46.060
She might find it funny if I show her the wee video that we had to appeal the monetization with

08:43:46.060 --> 08:43:48.620
Oh, I can put up Azura's meme ASMR now

08:43:50.540 --> 08:43:56.220
Oh my god, then all of her meme ASMR's are up. Oh, thank the heavens. Right. I'll need to keep that in the back of my mind

08:43:57.820 --> 08:44:00.220
Oh, jeez. Sorry. I was both listening to her

08:44:02.140 --> 08:44:04.140
Um

08:44:04.860 --> 08:44:06.860
Yeah, I can put up her

08:44:07.740 --> 08:44:09.740
Oh

08:44:13.340 --> 08:44:20.140
Sorry, I'm getting yawning because I had something a winged size. Oh, that's what that crazy weapon is. You guys are so coming with

08:44:20.940 --> 08:44:22.940
um

08:44:25.500 --> 08:44:29.580
Only need to remember 12 churches and forget how many seats along the way

08:44:30.620 --> 08:44:33.420
I mean, we're definitely freaking getting are you joking?

08:44:34.300 --> 08:44:36.300
I

08:44:37.100 --> 08:44:46.300
Wondering why Azura didn't have any ASMR uphills that were in line. Yes. So those meme ASMR's those originally were actually supposed to go up

08:44:47.180 --> 08:44:49.180
in order to get the

08:44:50.940 --> 08:44:52.940
Watch time for monetization

08:44:53.020 --> 08:44:58.380
However, the debut went so well that everyone reached the watch time after debut

08:44:58.860 --> 08:45:01.900
YouTube just took an entire week to update the stats

08:45:02.700 --> 08:45:05.980
And then like one after one we did our celebration

08:45:06.620 --> 08:45:12.940
But Azura behind the scenes actually got denied and we're having to make this like silly appeal of video. She's like

08:45:14.460 --> 08:45:18.140
It's so cringe. They're like explain how you make content

08:45:18.700 --> 08:45:22.780
And I had to like type of sense for her to say I am a live streamer

08:45:23.020 --> 08:45:27.020
I make my content live you can see via the evidence of all my live streams

08:45:27.100 --> 08:45:30.780
I play video games live like it just got really silly and arbitrary

08:45:31.420 --> 08:45:34.460
But the silly and arbitrary work. So I'm not even mad

08:45:35.420 --> 08:45:36.780
um

08:45:36.780 --> 08:45:41.100
Like I'm just glad they genuinely that appeal process actually works

08:45:41.580 --> 08:45:47.900
Like as much as youtube bad warning for kind of meme stuff or whatever a great area on ASMR now

08:45:48.620 --> 08:45:56.220
I'll I have to I have to put my hands up. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean that. Um, I have to put my hands up and say, you know what?

08:45:57.660 --> 08:45:59.660
We're

08:45:59.740 --> 08:46:01.740
What's that? Oh

08:46:01.900 --> 08:46:03.900
Where are we going? I don't think

08:46:04.220 --> 08:46:07.100
Anyone knows where we're going. Oh, he's okay. He's down there. He's down there

08:46:08.380 --> 08:46:10.380
Go down go down

08:46:10.860 --> 08:46:12.060
um

08:46:12.060 --> 08:46:15.900
I have to put my hands up and say, you know what youtube put this appeal system in place

08:46:16.460 --> 08:46:20.140
for things that happen and it actually did help us out

08:46:20.380 --> 08:46:24.540
Whereas old youtube didn't have an appeal system. So Azura would have had to have waited

08:46:25.260 --> 08:46:27.260
30 days on top of

08:46:27.900 --> 08:46:31.420
Uh, what she had already streamed at that point

08:46:32.380 --> 08:46:34.380
um

08:46:34.460 --> 08:46:38.300
So yeah, sorry. I have to admit youtube definitely won there. Um

08:46:39.820 --> 08:46:44.060
With that one, I do appreciate the appeal process actually working

08:46:46.940 --> 08:46:49.260
The bell tolls for the a better not

08:46:50.540 --> 08:46:52.540
I need to keep my voice

08:46:52.620 --> 08:46:56.700
I'm actually a bit worried about my voice breaking a little bit. Where are we at? Oh, no

08:46:58.220 --> 08:47:03.180
We're almost at nine hours and I'm like, is my voice gonna break before then

08:47:05.420 --> 08:47:07.260
Oh, no

08:47:07.260 --> 08:47:09.740
I can feel it breaking though, which is not only

09:12:32.740 --> 09:12:42.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:12:42.740 --> 09:12:50.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:12:50.740 --> 09:13:00.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:13:00.740 --> 09:13:10.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:13:10.740 --> 09:13:18.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:13:18.740 --> 09:13:28.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:13:28.740 --> 09:13:38.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:13:38.740 --> 09:13:48.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:13:48.740 --> 09:13:58.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:13:58.740 --> 09:14:06.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:14:06.740 --> 09:14:16.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:14:16.740 --> 09:14:26.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:14:26.740 --> 09:14:34.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:14:34.740 --> 09:14:44.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:14:44.740 --> 09:14:54.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:14:54.740 --> 09:15:02.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:15:02.740 --> 09:15:12.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:15:12.740 --> 09:15:22.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:15:22.740 --> 09:15:30.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:15:30.740 --> 09:15:40.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:15:40.740 --> 09:15:50.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:15:50.740 --> 09:15:58.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:15:58.740 --> 09:16:08.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:16:08.740 --> 09:16:18.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:16:18.740 --> 09:16:26.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:16:26.740 --> 09:16:36.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:16:36.740 --> 09:16:46.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:16:46.740 --> 09:16:56.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:16:56.740 --> 09:17:06.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:17:06.740 --> 09:17:14.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:17:14.740 --> 09:17:24.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:17:24.740 --> 09:17:34.740
Are you squinting me right now?

09:17:34.740 --> 09:17:38.740
Is this a portal?

09:17:38.740 --> 09:17:52.740
Examine the seal.

09:17:52.740 --> 09:17:54.740
To the left, there's a save.

09:17:54.740 --> 09:17:57.740
Yes! I remember!

09:17:57.740 --> 09:17:59.740
Ah, I remember the person.

09:17:59.740 --> 09:18:01.740
My hair was crazy.

09:18:01.740 --> 09:18:03.740
Oh no, my scars on my legs are gone.

09:18:03.740 --> 09:18:06.740
I thought it looked pretty cool.

09:18:06.740 --> 09:18:09.740
I like that AC has scars.

09:18:09.740 --> 09:18:13.740
Oh, there's two enemy reflexes.

09:18:13.740 --> 09:18:15.740
Who's not being around me?

09:18:15.740 --> 09:18:20.740
Oh man, I don't think I'm being around you.

09:18:20.740 --> 09:18:26.740
Okay, we are now at East Raya Lucaria State.

09:18:26.740 --> 09:18:36.740
Raya Lucaria.

09:18:36.740 --> 09:18:41.740
I would skip for you to do it.

09:18:41.740 --> 09:18:44.740
I love being like, come to the convention.

09:18:44.740 --> 09:18:47.740
My A-Bone will prevent me.

09:18:47.740 --> 09:18:53.740
There's only two that I've actually shown off.

09:18:53.740 --> 09:18:57.740
I don't know if the loading symbols aren't working for everyone,

09:18:57.740 --> 09:18:59.740
so I do apologize if you're trying,

09:18:59.740 --> 09:19:01.740
but you don't keep displaying.

09:19:01.740 --> 09:19:03.740
I'm not really sure what the deal is.

09:19:03.740 --> 09:19:06.740
Although I have a slight inclination,

09:19:06.740 --> 09:19:09.740
and I'm not saying that just because I'm a cuttlefish,

09:19:09.740 --> 09:19:14.740
that the servers are probably overloaded like crazy right now

09:19:14.740 --> 09:19:16.740
and are barely surviving.

09:19:16.740 --> 09:19:20.740
So just bear with me.

09:19:20.740 --> 09:19:27.740
As I said, I'm going to be playing this a lot until we're satisfied.

09:19:27.740 --> 09:19:31.740
Would you like to all cower before me?

09:19:31.740 --> 09:19:35.740
Time for your blessing!

09:19:35.740 --> 09:19:37.740
All done!

09:19:37.740 --> 09:19:39.740
You have been left.

09:19:39.740 --> 09:19:40.740
Now I put the sword on.

09:19:40.740 --> 09:19:41.740
Then right bumper.

09:19:41.740 --> 09:19:42.740
No, sorry.

09:19:42.740 --> 09:19:45.740
Why right bumper?

09:19:45.740 --> 09:19:48.740
He's whimpering in response.

09:19:48.740 --> 09:19:49.740
You have an inclination.

09:19:49.740 --> 09:19:50.740
Literally, I'm like,

09:19:50.740 --> 09:19:52.740
oh, inclination is such a good word.

09:19:52.740 --> 09:19:56.740
I think it's a good ASMR as well.

09:19:56.740 --> 09:19:58.740
Inclination.

09:19:58.740 --> 09:20:00.740
Yeah.

09:20:00.740 --> 09:20:02.740
I'm going to do some trigger words

09:20:02.740 --> 09:20:06.740
that are all related to cuttlefish or whatever.

09:20:06.740 --> 09:20:11.740
Inclination.

09:20:11.740 --> 09:20:13.740
I like when ASMR sounds like they're beatboxes

09:20:13.740 --> 09:20:16.740
and then they do trigger words.

09:20:16.740 --> 09:20:18.740
It's really funny.

09:20:18.740 --> 09:20:20.740
I'm not going to beatbox before anyone's like,

09:20:20.740 --> 09:20:22.740
why would you beatbox?

09:20:22.740 --> 09:20:24.740
Come this way.

09:20:24.740 --> 09:20:27.740
Are we just going the same way anyway?

09:20:27.740 --> 09:20:32.740
If that's your inclination.

09:20:32.740 --> 09:20:37.740
Do you feel ever that we're so inclined?

09:20:37.740 --> 09:20:40.740
Your car transaction has been inclined.

09:20:40.740 --> 09:20:42.740
Wait, that's not even funny.

09:20:42.740 --> 09:20:47.740
That doesn't even work in a sentence.

09:20:47.740 --> 09:20:48.740
Pardon.

09:20:48.740 --> 09:20:49.740
Are you guys in here?

09:20:49.740 --> 09:20:54.740
Oh, you are in here.

09:20:54.740 --> 09:20:57.740
Imagine a convention with 100 people in the floor

09:20:57.740 --> 09:21:00.740
like a starfish waiting for a girl to stomp on them.

09:21:00.740 --> 09:21:04.740
Sounds like a rifling convention of me or something.

09:21:04.740 --> 09:21:06.740
I feel like it would be funny though.

09:21:06.740 --> 09:21:10.740
But it's a wail day and appropriate.

09:21:10.740 --> 09:21:12.740
I don't know.

09:21:12.740 --> 09:21:14.740
Aren't you tired?

09:21:14.740 --> 09:21:18.740
Aren't you tired of everything being the exact same?

09:21:18.740 --> 09:21:20.740
Aren't you tired of never having the excitement

09:21:20.740 --> 09:21:22.740
of something new?

09:21:22.740 --> 09:21:24.740
Admit it.

09:21:24.740 --> 09:21:26.740
What is this?

09:21:26.740 --> 09:21:28.740
Why did the tree fall though?

09:21:28.740 --> 09:21:31.740
Is the tree bad?

09:21:31.740 --> 09:21:34.740
I would love it.

09:21:34.740 --> 09:21:36.740
What is launching at us?

09:21:36.740 --> 09:21:38.740
Something is going for us.

09:21:38.740 --> 09:21:40.740
I don't know what.

09:21:40.740 --> 09:21:42.740
Whoa.

09:21:42.740 --> 09:21:44.740
Am I missing something?

09:21:44.740 --> 09:21:45.740
Oh my god.

09:21:45.740 --> 09:21:46.740
What are they called?

09:21:46.740 --> 09:21:50.740
Trunchions or something.

09:21:50.740 --> 09:21:53.740
I've completely forgotten what these freaking things are called.

09:21:53.740 --> 09:21:58.740
But they're bad anyway.

09:21:58.740 --> 09:21:59.740
A trebuchet.

09:21:59.740 --> 09:22:00.740
Oh, a trebuchet.

09:22:00.740 --> 09:22:01.740
It's trebuchet.

09:22:01.740 --> 09:22:03.740
Not a truncheon.

09:22:03.740 --> 09:22:07.740
Oh my god.

09:22:07.740 --> 09:22:09.740
No, I can't hit him.

09:22:09.740 --> 09:22:13.740
His butt is so exposed to me.

09:22:13.740 --> 09:22:15.740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:22:15.740 --> 09:22:18.740
I don't know how I'm perfectly avoiding you by accident.

09:22:18.740 --> 09:22:20.740
Truly by accident.

09:22:20.740 --> 09:22:23.740
I'm not even putting effort into trying to avoid him.

09:22:23.740 --> 09:22:25.740
He's doing it all himself.

09:22:25.740 --> 09:22:27.740
I don't want to spank the horror.

09:22:27.740 --> 09:22:31.740
Something is wrong.

09:22:31.740 --> 09:22:34.740
Oh, that's Gideon's magic.

09:22:34.740 --> 09:22:37.740
Gideon does that in the Borscht.

09:22:37.740 --> 09:22:42.740
Aw, I don't think having to compare the thing.

09:22:42.740 --> 09:22:44.740
Oh my god.

09:22:44.740 --> 09:22:46.740
You're gone.

09:22:46.740 --> 09:22:47.740
I'm going to regret that.

09:22:47.740 --> 09:22:50.740
I'm going to ruin you, buddy.

09:22:50.740 --> 09:22:53.740
I'm trying to fade off the tiredness right now.

09:22:53.740 --> 09:22:57.740
What do you mean streaming for nine hours makes people tired?

09:22:57.740 --> 09:22:58.740
What are you talking about?

09:22:58.740 --> 09:23:00.740
This isn't even possible.

09:23:00.740 --> 09:23:05.740
In fact, the improbable occasion three.

09:23:05.740 --> 09:23:06.740
We're going to the right.

09:23:06.740 --> 09:23:07.740
Why are we going to the right?

09:23:07.740 --> 09:23:09.740
Is there a thing here?

09:23:09.740 --> 09:23:11.740
We're going to the right.

09:23:11.740 --> 09:23:13.740
Spank the horse.

09:23:13.740 --> 09:23:18.740
I've got reflexes by accident.

09:23:18.740 --> 09:23:19.740
I don't know how.

09:23:19.740 --> 09:23:20.740
I was like walking away from his attacks.

09:23:20.740 --> 09:23:22.740
I wasn't even rolling out of them.

09:23:22.740 --> 09:23:26.740
I'm just like, ooh, streamer luck.

09:23:26.740 --> 09:23:28.740
It'd be funny to say the least seen thing

09:23:28.740 --> 09:23:29.740
so many lean down.

09:23:29.740 --> 09:23:30.740
I don't know.

09:23:30.740 --> 09:23:34.740
I feel like that kind of like fun is like,

09:23:34.740 --> 09:23:36.740
what are those like once in a lifetime,

09:23:36.740 --> 09:23:37.740
like fun things?

09:23:37.740 --> 09:23:39.740
Like, I don't know.

09:23:39.740 --> 09:23:43.740
Like, I need to try and think of all the arguments

09:23:43.740 --> 09:23:44.740
before I start arguing.

09:23:44.740 --> 09:23:46.740
Like, what would someone say about it?

09:23:46.740 --> 09:23:49.740
Oh, that's behaviors inappropriate.

09:23:49.740 --> 09:23:50.740
We're all consenting adults.

09:23:50.740 --> 09:23:51.740
So annihilated.

09:23:51.740 --> 09:23:55.740
Wait, why am I getting madness?

09:23:55.740 --> 09:23:56.740
Oh my god.

09:23:56.740 --> 09:23:57.740
It's the Lord of the Rings tower.

09:23:57.740 --> 09:23:58.740
How did I do this last time?

09:23:58.740 --> 09:24:00.740
I'm pretty sure I did do this successfully

09:24:00.740 --> 09:24:01.740
because I died.

09:24:01.740 --> 09:24:02.740
And then like,

09:24:02.740 --> 09:24:03.740
someone would be like, oh, that's so tacky.

09:24:03.740 --> 09:24:05.740
Like, oh, she's just a Lutuber.

09:24:05.740 --> 09:24:08.740
I never said I was going to fucking praise the Lord

09:24:08.740 --> 09:24:09.740
in the middle of the stream.

09:24:09.740 --> 09:24:11.740
I'm only going to praise him as a leaflin's tentacle.

09:24:11.740 --> 09:24:13.740
So I don't know why you're getting cheeky.

09:24:13.740 --> 09:24:15.740
How is this not seeing me?

09:24:15.740 --> 09:24:17.740
It's so vague.

09:24:17.740 --> 09:24:21.740
Well, their arguments could be made.

09:24:21.740 --> 09:24:23.740
I can't think of anything.

09:24:23.740 --> 09:24:24.740
Are we, okay.

09:24:24.740 --> 09:24:25.740
We're just walking away.

09:24:25.740 --> 09:24:30.740
The Eye of Sauron Tower.

09:24:30.740 --> 09:24:31.740
Yeah.

09:24:31.740 --> 09:24:33.740
I couldn't think.

09:24:33.740 --> 09:24:35.740
I was like, where's that madness coming from?

09:24:35.740 --> 09:24:39.740
Nothing's attacking me.

09:24:39.740 --> 09:24:41.740
I am apparently getting life or something.

09:24:41.740 --> 09:24:47.740
I don't know.

09:24:47.740 --> 09:24:48.740
Reflexes.

09:24:48.740 --> 09:24:51.740
Oh, I like that.

09:24:51.740 --> 09:24:54.740
I need to look up all the words that go R-E.

09:24:54.740 --> 09:24:59.740
And then, like, insert fling into it, basically.

09:24:59.740 --> 09:25:02.740
Oh, me goes.

09:25:02.740 --> 09:25:07.740
Well, I think there may be a painting in a shack here.

09:25:07.740 --> 09:25:10.740
Maybe.

09:25:10.740 --> 09:25:13.740
I could be a terrible mistaken.

09:25:13.740 --> 09:25:17.740
I can't remember.

09:25:17.740 --> 09:25:19.740
It may be some other thing.

09:25:19.740 --> 09:25:21.740
Oh, this is the Madness Village.

09:25:21.740 --> 09:25:28.740
I don't know.

09:25:28.740 --> 09:25:30.740
And it's nothing fun.

09:25:30.740 --> 09:25:32.740
I hate this section so much.

09:25:32.740 --> 09:25:36.740
I mean, we don't have to hurt the eye.

09:25:36.740 --> 09:25:41.740
We don't have to hurt the eye of Sauron, so we should be okay.

09:25:41.740 --> 09:25:43.740
Where's the other replay?

09:25:43.740 --> 09:25:48.740
Is he ahead?

09:25:48.740 --> 09:25:51.740
Have we lost the other replay?

09:25:51.740 --> 09:25:55.740
I don't see him.

09:25:55.740 --> 09:25:57.740
I'm trying to wrangle my children.

09:25:57.740 --> 09:26:00.740
Don't he put collars and leashes on you?

09:26:00.740 --> 09:26:03.740
Where are you?

09:26:03.740 --> 09:26:05.740
Are you lost?

09:26:05.740 --> 09:26:10.740
Am I going crazy and he's there?

09:26:10.740 --> 09:26:12.740
I'll give you just spread waiting.

09:26:12.740 --> 09:26:13.740
Hold on.

09:26:13.740 --> 09:26:15.740
I'll wait right here.

09:26:15.740 --> 09:26:20.740
I don't know where the heck he is.

09:26:20.740 --> 09:26:21.740
Oh, he's down there.

09:26:21.740 --> 09:26:22.740
Oh, you made it.

09:26:22.740 --> 09:26:23.740
Okay.

09:26:23.740 --> 09:26:24.740
We found you.

09:26:24.740 --> 09:26:25.740
What are you?

09:26:25.740 --> 09:26:26.740
What even is that?

09:26:26.740 --> 09:26:30.740
Is that that dragon spear that does that thing on the snake?

09:26:30.740 --> 09:26:33.740
What is your fit?

09:26:33.740 --> 09:26:37.740
How do you get giffy or looking every time we see you?

09:26:37.740 --> 09:26:39.740
Oh, my goodness.

09:26:39.740 --> 09:26:42.740
You look like an elf.

09:26:42.740 --> 09:26:45.740
Okay, let's keep going.

09:26:45.740 --> 09:26:50.740
Let's keep going.

09:26:50.740 --> 09:26:52.740
Oh, you got more clothes.

09:26:52.740 --> 09:26:57.740
How do you swap a pearl so quickly?

09:26:57.740 --> 09:26:58.740
How do you know?

09:26:58.740 --> 09:26:59.740
Maybe you've got it.

09:26:59.740 --> 09:27:01.740
Or maybe you're just MLG at this game.

09:27:01.740 --> 09:27:04.740
MLG inventory.

09:27:04.740 --> 09:27:06.740
Church of inhibition.

09:27:06.740 --> 09:27:10.740
We'll definitely go do none of that around here.

09:27:10.740 --> 09:27:11.740
Touch.

09:27:11.740 --> 09:27:12.740
Great.

09:27:12.740 --> 09:27:13.740
Thank you.

09:27:13.740 --> 09:27:14.740
Oh, no.

09:27:14.740 --> 09:27:16.740
What's in the lady's arm?

09:27:16.740 --> 09:27:17.740
She didn't make it.

09:27:17.740 --> 09:27:18.740
Are you alive?

09:27:18.740 --> 09:27:19.740
Thank you.

09:27:19.740 --> 09:27:20.740
Oh.

09:27:20.740 --> 09:27:22.740
Oh, it's my wedding cloak.

09:27:22.740 --> 09:27:25.740
I think I used to marry Rihanna.

09:27:25.740 --> 09:27:27.740
No, Rihanna.

09:27:27.740 --> 09:27:32.740
I know it's another maiden, but the maidens are good, but we don't know this one.

09:27:32.740 --> 09:27:36.740
Okay, let's go next.

09:27:36.740 --> 09:27:41.740
The invader needs to leave real quick.

09:27:41.740 --> 09:27:42.740
The Church of Innovations.

09:27:42.740 --> 09:27:44.740
I thought we were going to do another prayer again.

09:27:44.740 --> 09:27:49.740
Wait, is this a fight?

09:27:49.740 --> 09:27:51.740
The Minish Cap NPV, honestly.

09:27:51.740 --> 09:27:52.740
Oh, no.

09:27:52.740 --> 09:27:56.740
I need to fight on my own.

09:27:56.740 --> 09:27:59.740
I'm so brave.

09:27:59.740 --> 09:28:00.740
I'm so brave.

09:28:00.740 --> 09:28:01.740
I can do it.

09:28:01.740 --> 09:28:02.740
I can do it.

09:28:02.740 --> 09:28:05.740
I'm so brave.

09:28:06.740 --> 09:28:12.740
I'm going to sit right here.

09:28:12.740 --> 09:28:14.740
You should summon in now.

09:28:14.740 --> 09:28:17.740
Even with reeflings with me?

09:28:17.740 --> 09:28:21.740
Can reeflings do the honors on spit-roof- reeflings?

09:28:21.740 --> 09:28:25.740
Spit-roost this man.

09:28:25.740 --> 09:28:26.740
Reeflings?

09:28:26.740 --> 09:28:32.740
Get out and spit-roost this man, won't you?

09:28:32.740 --> 09:28:33.740
Where?

09:28:33.740 --> 09:28:34.740
Here.

09:28:34.740 --> 09:28:37.740
Did I walk back up to the church again?

09:28:37.740 --> 09:28:38.740
Okay, yeah.

09:28:38.740 --> 09:28:39.740
Here he is.

09:28:39.740 --> 09:28:42.740
Reeflings destroy this man.

09:28:42.740 --> 09:28:47.740
Unless I do it for you.

09:28:47.740 --> 09:28:51.740
Yeah, yeah, nice fight.

09:28:51.740 --> 09:28:53.740
Okay, that was perfect.

09:28:53.740 --> 09:28:57.740
Couldn't have asked for a better thingy.

09:28:57.740 --> 09:28:59.740
I've got a fingerprint.

09:28:59.740 --> 09:29:00.740
Great.

09:29:00.740 --> 09:29:02.740
Did you win for her?

09:29:02.740 --> 09:29:06.740
All right, how do I get an evil reefling in again?

09:29:06.740 --> 09:29:08.740
Is evil reefling at the church?

09:29:08.740 --> 09:29:10.740
Wait, spit-roost that man, maybe.

09:29:10.740 --> 09:29:14.740
Oh, sorry, spit-roost that woman.

09:29:14.740 --> 09:29:16.740
Okay, let's see.

09:29:16.740 --> 09:29:19.740
Sorry, but we chairs go again.

09:29:19.740 --> 09:29:21.740
Whoa, you scared me doing that.

09:29:21.740 --> 09:29:25.740
I thought we were reinvading that woman.

09:29:25.740 --> 09:29:27.740
Do I need a tingling?

09:29:27.740 --> 09:29:29.740
No, I don't need a tingling.

09:29:30.740 --> 09:29:35.740
No enemy reefling?

09:29:35.740 --> 09:29:37.740
Oh, where are we?

09:29:37.740 --> 09:29:39.740
I don't even know where we are.

09:29:39.740 --> 09:29:41.740
We're in the church of inhibition.

09:29:41.740 --> 09:29:45.740
If an enemy reefling wants to be naughty, naughty.

09:29:45.740 --> 09:29:46.740
Are you burying?

09:29:46.740 --> 09:29:47.740
Or do you have to go?

09:29:47.740 --> 09:29:49.740
Or are you just burying in general?

09:29:49.740 --> 09:29:51.740
I have-hello?

09:29:51.740 --> 09:29:52.740
Hey!

09:29:52.740 --> 09:29:53.740
Hi!

09:29:53.740 --> 09:29:58.740
I have-I have yippee!

09:29:59.740 --> 09:30:04.740
That is a-did you even get any lift with that?

09:30:04.740 --> 09:30:07.740
Yeah, I really did not get that high up their lap.

09:30:07.740 --> 09:30:09.740
Oh, enemy reefling.

09:30:09.740 --> 09:30:11.740
Okay, we're safe to get again.

09:30:11.740 --> 09:30:15.740
We need not to worry for we are safe.

09:30:15.740 --> 09:30:19.740
That had big colon ambulance, but not for me.

09:30:19.740 --> 09:30:20.740
Okay.

09:30:28.740 --> 09:30:30.740
Wait, you didn't come in?

09:30:32.740 --> 09:30:33.740
Oh!

09:30:33.740 --> 09:30:35.740
I'm unable to summon you.

09:30:37.740 --> 09:30:38.740
Whoa!

09:30:38.740 --> 09:30:39.740
Whoa!

09:30:39.740 --> 09:30:41.740
Am I being-am I losing it?

09:30:41.740 --> 09:30:43.740
This schizophrenia is kicking in.

09:30:43.740 --> 09:30:46.740
It's not looking good.

09:30:46.740 --> 09:30:48.740
Are we being invaded?

09:30:48.740 --> 09:30:49.740
I think they both disappear.

09:30:49.740 --> 09:30:50.740
It gave me an error.

09:30:50.740 --> 09:30:52.740
I think you're invaded.

09:30:52.740 --> 09:30:53.740
No, reeflings.

09:30:53.740 --> 09:30:54.740
I need to kill her.

09:30:54.740 --> 09:30:58.740
I need to pretend to be a piece of furniture.

09:31:00.740 --> 09:31:02.740
I think I am being invaded.

09:31:02.740 --> 09:31:04.740
I can't see anyone's thing.

09:31:04.740 --> 09:31:06.740
Ah, same.

09:31:06.740 --> 09:31:07.740
So...

09:31:07.740 --> 09:31:08.740
Oh!

09:31:08.740 --> 09:31:09.740
Oh!

09:31:09.740 --> 09:31:10.740
I heard it!

09:31:10.740 --> 09:31:11.740
I heard it!

09:31:11.740 --> 09:31:12.740
I heard it!

09:31:12.740 --> 09:31:13.740
I heard it!

09:31:13.740 --> 09:31:14.740
Sorry, someone's getting-getting right now.

09:31:14.740 --> 09:31:15.740
I do not want to be fricking dumb.

09:31:15.740 --> 09:31:17.740
Wait, turn into furniture.

09:31:17.740 --> 09:31:18.740
Chair.

09:31:18.740 --> 09:31:19.740
Table.

09:31:19.740 --> 09:31:22.740
Elden Ring knew my funny prank and said no.

09:31:22.740 --> 09:31:25.740
Oh no, are you doing a prank?

09:31:25.740 --> 09:31:26.740
Okay.

09:31:26.740 --> 09:31:27.740
I'm going to test-

09:31:27.740 --> 09:31:30.740
I'm going to test the tea.

09:31:30.740 --> 09:31:31.740
Okay.

09:31:32.740 --> 09:31:33.740
Are you doing this?

09:31:33.740 --> 09:31:34.740
No.

09:31:35.740 --> 09:31:37.740
Okay, I'm having some water first though.

09:31:37.740 --> 09:31:38.740
Hydration check, please.

09:31:38.740 --> 09:31:39.740
A reefling.

09:31:45.740 --> 09:31:47.740
Wait, did I have that?

09:31:49.740 --> 09:31:51.740
Did I even have that?

09:31:52.740 --> 09:31:54.740
Or did I not pick it up?

09:31:54.740 --> 09:31:56.740
I don't really know what it is.

09:31:56.740 --> 09:31:57.740
This?

09:32:00.740 --> 09:32:02.740
No, I didn't pick it up.

09:32:04.740 --> 09:32:06.740
Oh, it's for you.

09:32:06.740 --> 09:32:08.740
Good night, rest well, both of you.

09:32:09.740 --> 09:32:10.740
Oh, I've not blessed you.

09:32:10.740 --> 09:32:11.740
Okay, hold on.

09:32:11.740 --> 09:32:12.740
Let me bless you.

09:32:15.740 --> 09:32:18.740
Do you want to come over as well to be blessed?

09:32:18.740 --> 09:32:20.740
I can't even roll out the statue.

09:32:20.740 --> 09:32:22.740
Now I'm getting mad to do-

09:32:22.740 --> 09:32:25.740
I was going to say, did you want me to do it on the crystals?

09:32:25.740 --> 09:32:29.740
I think that might be out of my expertise range.

09:32:32.740 --> 09:32:33.740
Perfect.

09:32:34.740 --> 09:32:35.740
Perfect.

09:32:35.740 --> 09:32:36.740
Where are we heading to next?

09:32:36.740 --> 09:32:38.740
Do you know where you're taking me?

09:32:40.740 --> 09:32:41.740
Does anyone know?

09:32:41.740 --> 09:32:43.740
Oh, I just straight up killed this one.

09:32:43.740 --> 09:32:45.740
Sorry, reefling.

09:32:45.740 --> 09:32:47.740
It wasn't supposed to be like that.

09:32:47.740 --> 09:32:50.740
But he went out doing what he wanted.

09:32:50.740 --> 09:32:51.740
That'd be pretty painful.

09:32:51.740 --> 09:32:52.740
Oh, yeah.

09:32:52.740 --> 09:32:55.740
Did you not see the fake taxi?

09:32:55.740 --> 09:32:59.740
I would take the guy, like, tried to jump on the car

09:32:59.740 --> 09:33:02.740
and slide in,

09:33:02.740 --> 09:33:04.740
but he, like, completely messed up

09:33:04.740 --> 09:33:07.740
and, like, really hurt himself.

09:33:09.740 --> 09:33:10.740
Crystals might be stretching it,

09:33:10.740 --> 09:33:12.740
literally, and figuratively.

09:33:12.740 --> 09:33:14.740
Just no one know where we're going.

09:33:14.740 --> 09:33:15.740
Oh, hold on.

09:33:15.740 --> 09:33:16.740
Let me open up the map.

09:33:16.740 --> 09:33:19.740
Oh, I can't because the game thinks I'm fighting.

09:33:19.740 --> 09:33:22.740
I'm not fighting reefling.

09:33:22.740 --> 09:33:25.740
I can't even open up the map to see where we're going.

09:33:29.740 --> 09:33:30.740
I'll let you go.

09:33:30.740 --> 09:33:34.740
I don't think there is anywhere to go here.

09:33:34.740 --> 09:33:36.740
You've got to move.

09:33:37.740 --> 09:33:39.740
Hmm.

09:33:39.740 --> 09:33:42.740
Is that everything I can pick up?

09:33:43.740 --> 09:33:45.740
I've sold in, I guess.

09:33:45.740 --> 09:33:47.740
We're going back to the DLC.

09:33:47.740 --> 09:33:48.740
No.

09:33:48.740 --> 09:33:50.740
I don't think I saw that one.

09:33:50.740 --> 09:33:51.740
Oh.

09:33:53.740 --> 09:33:54.740
Oh, no.

09:33:54.740 --> 09:33:56.740
You didn't have to go, though.

09:33:57.740 --> 09:33:59.740
Is that everything?

09:34:00.740 --> 09:34:05.740
Um, we would have to do a campaign to get up on top.

09:34:06.740 --> 09:34:08.740
I think.

09:34:08.740 --> 09:34:11.740
And we did all of that down there.

09:34:11.740 --> 09:34:13.740
Caleb has one or two.

09:34:13.740 --> 09:34:14.740
Did we do Caleb?

09:34:14.740 --> 09:34:17.740
Not the top part of Caleb, we haven't.

09:34:17.740 --> 09:34:19.740
Do I have all four talisman slots?

09:34:19.740 --> 09:34:21.740
No, I only have the two.

09:34:21.740 --> 09:34:25.740
The crotch bone is the strongest bone on the body for a reason.

09:34:25.740 --> 09:34:27.740
And that reason is strong, eh?

09:34:27.740 --> 09:34:28.740
Stop.

09:34:28.740 --> 09:34:29.740
That's so good.

09:34:29.740 --> 09:34:31.740
I thought you were actually going to educate us there.

09:34:31.740 --> 09:34:32.740
I'm like, yeah, yeah.

09:34:32.740 --> 09:34:34.740
What is it?

09:34:34.740 --> 09:34:35.740
I don't.

09:34:35.740 --> 09:34:37.740
I only have two talisman.

09:34:37.740 --> 09:34:40.740
I can't recall how to unlock more.

09:34:40.740 --> 09:34:42.740
Go to the church where you find the physics.

09:34:42.740 --> 09:34:44.740
There's a teleporter behind it.

09:34:44.740 --> 09:34:50.740
Um, yeah, I know exactly what church you're talking about.

09:34:55.740 --> 09:34:57.740
It takes you to the top of the Caleb.

09:35:00.740 --> 09:35:01.740
Wait, that remains.

09:35:01.740 --> 09:35:04.740
I don't know if I should go and then.

09:35:04.740 --> 09:35:08.740
Talk to the finger lady at the round table and she gives you one.

09:35:08.740 --> 09:35:09.740
Okay.

09:35:09.740 --> 09:35:13.740
We go talk to the lady at the round table.

09:35:13.740 --> 09:35:17.740
Am I listening to that instruction?

09:35:17.740 --> 09:35:21.740
How does it feel being able to instruct me to do stuff?

09:35:21.740 --> 09:35:22.740
Does it?

09:35:22.740 --> 09:35:23.740
Oh, hello.

09:35:23.740 --> 09:35:25.740
I don't believe we've met.

09:35:25.740 --> 09:35:26.740
We haven't.

09:35:26.740 --> 09:35:27.740
I don't know you.

09:35:28.740 --> 09:35:31.740
I'm taking a sipping tin of pee.

09:35:52.740 --> 09:35:53.740
What are you on about?

09:35:53.740 --> 09:35:54.740
Honestly.

09:35:54.740 --> 09:35:55.740
Oh, it's you.

09:35:55.740 --> 09:35:56.740
Hello.

09:35:56.740 --> 09:35:57.740
Oh, she levels up.

09:35:57.740 --> 09:35:58.740
Spirations.

09:35:58.740 --> 09:35:59.740
I recognize.

09:35:59.740 --> 09:36:01.740
My name is Roderica.

09:36:01.740 --> 09:36:04.740
I should have told you sooner.

09:36:04.740 --> 09:36:06.740
Isn't this place impressive?

09:36:06.740 --> 09:36:09.740
Where the domes for all the little in control.

09:36:09.740 --> 09:36:12.740
Covert quarters of the two fingers.

09:36:12.740 --> 09:36:13.740
Whip.

09:36:13.740 --> 09:36:19.740
Did you know that women actually have 206 bones in their bodies?

09:36:19.740 --> 09:36:21.740
Would they like another one?

09:36:21.740 --> 09:36:25.740
Oh, wait.

09:36:25.740 --> 09:36:27.740
Oh, what?

09:36:27.740 --> 09:36:29.740
Snow flakes.

09:36:29.740 --> 09:36:30.740
Relax.

09:36:30.740 --> 09:36:31.740
Snow flakes.

09:36:31.740 --> 09:36:33.740
It's called a joke.

09:36:33.740 --> 09:36:34.740
Right.

09:36:34.740 --> 09:36:35.740
What am I to do?

09:36:35.740 --> 09:36:39.740
I'm still looking for my own purpose.

09:36:39.740 --> 09:36:40.740
Okay.

09:36:40.740 --> 09:36:43.740
What am I doing here?

09:36:43.740 --> 09:36:45.740
I'm talking to the furled fingers.

09:36:45.740 --> 09:36:47.740
I'm going to get your fingers.

09:36:47.740 --> 09:36:48.740
Your fingers.

09:36:48.740 --> 09:36:50.740
I just remembered that right now.

09:36:50.740 --> 09:36:51.740
Wait.

09:36:51.740 --> 09:36:52.740
No.

09:36:52.740 --> 09:36:54.740
Wrong area.

09:36:55.740 --> 09:36:57.740
Furled fingers up here.

09:36:57.740 --> 09:36:59.740
The two fingers.

09:36:59.740 --> 09:37:00.740
Hiya.

09:37:00.740 --> 09:37:01.740
America.

09:37:01.740 --> 09:37:02.740
Hiya.

09:37:02.740 --> 09:37:05.740
Oh, you don't want to interact with my thing.

09:37:05.740 --> 09:37:07.740
I had my doubts.

09:37:07.740 --> 09:37:10.740
But my look at you.

09:37:10.740 --> 09:37:12.740
Can you even see me?

09:37:12.740 --> 09:37:18.740
I've only once before have I seen two great runes together.

09:37:18.740 --> 09:37:20.740
Look there.

09:37:20.740 --> 09:37:24.740
The fingers shudder with exuberance.

09:37:24.740 --> 09:37:28.740
Fine work, brave tarnished.

09:37:28.740 --> 09:37:31.740
The greater will is pleased.

09:37:31.740 --> 09:37:35.740
You have earned the right to become Elden Lord.

09:37:35.740 --> 09:37:36.740
Oh.

09:37:36.740 --> 09:37:42.740
Now, seek the Earth Tree and an audience with Queen Marica

09:37:42.740 --> 09:37:48.740
to become Elden Lord and restore the Golden Order.

09:37:48.740 --> 09:37:50.740
We can do that.

09:37:58.740 --> 09:37:59.740
Farewell.

09:37:59.740 --> 09:38:00.740
Farewell.

09:38:00.740 --> 09:38:01.740
Why?

09:38:01.740 --> 09:38:04.740
Oh, thank you, darling.

09:38:04.740 --> 09:38:06.740
Go forth.

09:38:06.740 --> 09:38:07.740
Become Elden Lord.

09:38:07.740 --> 09:38:09.740
I like Elden Ring the Bushkush.

09:38:09.740 --> 09:38:11.740
She's very nice.

09:38:11.740 --> 09:38:15.740
Thank you, Elden Ring the Bushkush.

09:38:15.740 --> 09:38:17.740
Hmm.

09:38:17.740 --> 09:38:20.740
Raise this equipment loads.

09:38:20.740 --> 09:38:23.740
Raise this holy tack but Lord's Damage Mediation.

09:38:23.740 --> 09:38:26.740
Raise this attack power after a critical hit.

09:38:26.740 --> 09:38:28.740
I mean, where are you?

09:38:28.740 --> 09:38:32.740
Constantly attract enemy aggression.

09:38:32.740 --> 09:38:37.740
Why would you want that?

09:38:38.740 --> 09:38:45.740
Or should I put that on so you guys can just go crazy on any boss?

09:38:45.740 --> 09:38:48.740
Do you guys use that?

09:38:48.740 --> 09:38:50.740
Is that why he's so...

09:38:50.740 --> 09:38:55.740
Whenever we do a boss, it's like such a swampy boss.

09:38:59.740 --> 09:39:01.740
With the power of remembrance menu,

09:39:01.740 --> 09:39:03.740
you can draw out the power of remembrance magic.

09:39:04.740 --> 09:39:07.740
Once that power is claimed, it will be lost.

09:39:15.740 --> 09:39:17.740
I'll just leave it.

09:39:17.740 --> 09:39:18.740
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:39:18.740 --> 09:39:19.740
Teehee.

09:39:19.740 --> 09:39:20.740
Teehee, sorry.

09:39:20.740 --> 09:39:22.740
The reflings make all the decisions for me.

09:39:22.740 --> 09:39:24.740
Teehee, thank you for the Talisman pouch.

09:39:24.740 --> 09:39:26.740
So, yeah!

09:39:26.740 --> 09:39:28.740
Um...

09:39:31.740 --> 09:39:32.740
Uh, right.

09:39:32.740 --> 09:39:36.740

09:39:36.740 --> 09:39:38.740
Are you ok mate? Jees.

09:39:38.740 --> 09:39:40.740

09:39:41.740 --> 09:39:42.740

09:50:16.900 --> 09:50:23.220
steady need to need a little wind up just to really get it going good

09:50:26.660 --> 09:50:31.700
yeah I've been blessed I like how the music gets all intense and I was like no no you don't

09:50:31.700 --> 09:50:38.260

wait he doesn't get activated until what until I whack him

09:51:03.540 --> 09:51:06.900
are you gonna whack him first or do you don't want to whack him at all

09:51:12.340 --> 09:51:18.900
oh he doesn't interact if you don't and oh it's just news to me I thought he always like came out

09:51:18.900 --> 09:51:28.180
swinging strange he doesn't attack if you don't attack I think pretty much all the other episodes

09:51:28.180 --> 09:51:35.060
resulted yeah either claim to film documentary but they wanted to all right that sounds more

09:51:35.060 --> 09:51:44.980
like we thought make me extra we got another flask how many flasks I have I have well I have seven

09:51:44.980 --> 09:51:47.620
eight and I'll wonder

09:51:49.780 --> 09:51:52.420
but yeah not monster misumi's was kind of like a goofy

09:51:53.460 --> 09:52:00.980
although I could have sworn about the dvd collection and there's like a hidden scene with

09:52:00.980 --> 09:52:07.220
pappy at the doctor or something and I remember being pretty shocked but it was because I had

09:52:07.220 --> 09:52:12.660
never seen like that kind of stuff before I don't know anything

09:52:17.140 --> 09:52:19.460
I can't remember if he showed her chest or not

09:52:22.020 --> 09:52:27.940

wow why is magic so strong that magic felt like it was good is there anything that's even

09:56:18.500 --> 09:56:27.060
resistant to magic at all? I still move around every day you were so brave in the fight you

09:56:27.060 --> 09:56:33.860
don't need to move for it all okay let's go grab some refling now that we've done that

09:56:34.900 --> 09:56:41.460
we don't need to worry about any d spawn you have 19 strength how come how does it come that you

09:56:41.460 --> 09:56:53.300
don't do any damage I think my weapon's like next to useless is my guess I think I don't I'm

09:56:53.300 --> 09:56:59.380
I'm I'm slightly unsure yeah after I've made a movie I'm sure yeah okay here we go

09:57:02.900 --> 09:57:03.860
wait you can come in

09:57:04.420 --> 09:57:11.220
I think it may be bedtime soon for us you know that we can or do you want me to go for the

09:57:11.220 --> 09:57:19.140
10 the full 12 hours or 11 hours and 55 minutes since the vault literally explodes at that mark

09:57:19.300 --> 09:57:23.300
10

09:57:29.380 --> 09:57:36.340
range we have something to prove we do up to you I'm here for the rage

09:57:36.340 --> 09:57:43.940
exhausted I'm listening in the same voice all day I think if you want to sleep you can't sleep

09:57:44.820 --> 09:57:50.820
hmm I think I'm gonna have to change my sleeping time it's the only problem

09:57:56.260 --> 09:58:03.940
what I'm needing to do is basically sleep as soon as I finish stream and then that means I'm awake

09:58:03.940 --> 09:58:10.020
and I can record like ASMR and edit a couple of hours before I stream I think I'm gonna have to

09:58:10.020 --> 09:58:19.780
do it like that because um because the current way I'm doing it is I wake up before stream but

09:58:19.780 --> 09:58:24.820
I'm so tired after stream so I think I just need to do all my work before stream that's the best thing

09:58:24.820 --> 09:58:31.940
you lying down got a second layer down here you are yawning maybe sleeping might be on my

09:58:32.020 --> 09:58:39.140
person a tune hope make sure you're full mass because if you're semi I'm gonna do something

09:58:39.140 --> 09:58:53.620
that's really gonna hurt we should all go get that whimper coconut

09:58:54.020 --> 09:59:03.380
he was semi oh that's why he took some damage yeah did you know your pinches can actually

09:59:03.380 --> 09:59:14.740
break that's just terrible I suppose yeah I don't even know how you fix that can you even put it

09:59:14.740 --> 09:59:23.300
in a cast I don't think so no impress me then literally it's so funny that we cooked enough

09:59:29.300 --> 09:59:35.620
why wait sorry I always forget to to have my weapon oh was that full mass

09:59:36.420 --> 09:59:48.820
I'm even dead in it oh oh you sound like those those vain birdie

09:59:49.220 --> 10:00:04.660
there's no bone it's just muscle potentially

10:00:09.540 --> 10:00:16.820
I feel like you I don't even how do you manage that it's a muscle

10:00:19.540 --> 10:00:26.580
can in theory could a reefing cling flap so hard he'd hurt himself

10:00:29.300 --> 10:00:32.180
whoa whoa

10:00:35.460 --> 10:00:37.620

magic okay as I'm saying I was really interrupted

10:00:52.180 --> 10:00:59.860
literally if we can keep like if we can keep the boss off of like the magic player I think that's

10:00:59.940 --> 10:01:04.820
like the perfect job you have what I knew you can't whimper after you want to pay

10:01:05.940 --> 10:01:19.300

10:02:46.180 --> 10:02:51.300
okay I can't level up that's fine do I want anything new here

10:02:52.740 --> 10:02:58.420
temporary boost or damage make attack more likely to break enemy's dance move

10:02:59.300 --> 10:03:04.420

10:05:05.220 --> 10:05:12.340
meat of the DLC so I guess today was just a speed run of getting set up for it which I'm happy with

10:05:12.420 --> 10:05:18.900
because I did want to do a fresh save I think tomorrow we actually do the DLC

10:05:19.540 --> 10:05:24.500

the smithing guy

10:14:35.140 --> 10:14:38.180
this game like hard air to play I mean

10:14:40.580 --> 10:14:45.540
if you got refueling to carry you through the entirety of every single section of the game

10:14:46.340 --> 10:14:47.220
it's all right

10:14:49.220 --> 10:14:51.460

is everything about the grace oh okay sorry my apologies

10:15:06.020 --> 10:15:11.860
okay safety first at the grace I thought it was like a quick thing that was like only to send

10:15:11.860 --> 10:15:12.500

10:15:15.060 --> 10:15:15.860

10:15:38.820 --> 10:15:40.820
some

10:15:47.620 --> 10:15:49.860
I think only one good refling or one bad refling

10:15:52.980 --> 10:15:55.300
I think I tired everyone out with my dream

10:15:56.740 --> 10:16:00.580
imagine if someone was threatening to me creep right now maybe get me people

10:16:03.060 --> 10:16:07.780
oh it didn't work odd I think the servers might be freaking just an ankle bit

there's also different gimmicks that you can

10:16:12.340 --> 10:16:15.540
speaking of things breaking I'm about to have a coughing fit if I don't hide

10:16:30.500 --> 10:16:35.140

10:18:35.380 --> 10:18:40.740
not the lamb the lamb isn't doing any well I guess they roll and hurt but they don't hurt too much

10:18:46.180 --> 10:18:53.300
I don't know how you guys are hanging literally I'm ready to pass out I already know I'm gonna

10:18:53.300 --> 10:19:02.100
try and flip flip my sleeve so I sleep right after stream and then I can do work when I leave off

10:19:12.820 --> 10:19:18.500
that night shift life helps and hurts me chat is the reflection of a streamer

10:19:18.980 --> 10:19:24.020
that's my word that word I'm not allowed to say

10:19:33.140 --> 10:19:37.380
oh that burn arc the reefing endurance finally passed

10:19:38.420 --> 10:19:42.260
like I like being able to say that yeah I'm a cheeky endurance viewer

10:19:42.420 --> 10:19:44.580
well it may I get fucking tired too

10:19:47.220 --> 10:19:54.260
wow that's a lot of enemies up ahead does someone have like an eoe magic spell or fun

10:19:55.940 --> 10:19:57.700
oh it's a chariot that's why

10:19:59.620 --> 10:20:01.220
okay hold on why

10:20:02.900 --> 10:20:03.780
oh let's forget that

10:20:07.460 --> 10:20:08.260
not magic

10:20:13.220 --> 10:20:16.660
oh you can't open it if the guys are still moving the carriage

10:20:18.980 --> 10:20:22.820
interesting I think it would be funny if you could like rob them without them knowing

10:20:23.700 --> 10:20:29.220
I feel like we're putting them out of their misery because we look at literally how they're

10:20:29.780 --> 10:20:36.820
it goes through them sorry we're putting these guys out of their misery sometimes it's time to

10:20:37.780 --> 10:20:38.260
move

10:20:41.460 --> 10:20:48.500
so on and start working five words before you stream until you move to the phone when you

10:20:48.500 --> 10:20:57.460
need to move around oh my gosh I mean it's going to be very weird when my dad comes over

10:20:58.340 --> 10:21:03.300
because the streams are literally going to be like what I consider like a regular stream time

10:21:04.260 --> 10:21:08.580
um are you good

10:21:10.740 --> 10:21:17.700
just infinite horse you okay you give the horse a little kiss you make him feel better

10:21:18.820 --> 10:21:22.660
shrodinger's horse he's neither dead or alive because he doesn't need to move

10:21:24.900 --> 10:21:27.460
oh are you scared of the horse

10:21:27.860 --> 10:21:37.620
he's just chillin yeah like it's going to be so weird being like a normal streamer like

10:21:37.620 --> 10:21:42.660
two ever streams four ever streams what what am I supposed to do

10:21:44.820 --> 10:21:49.940
so I need my background noise at work hopefully I make more tasks like on that one

10:21:52.420 --> 10:21:54.740
and just like come out with like the most inappropriate thing

10:21:55.460 --> 10:21:59.460
ever oh I'll completely miss that no one saw that

10:22:02.260 --> 10:22:04.980
no one saw that I was so embarrassed for no reason

10:22:09.380 --> 10:22:14.820
I'm gonna hear them horses doing mannequin challenge I remember that

10:22:16.980 --> 10:22:21.220
ASMR streams during work you'll have more time to work on your ASMR collabs I suppose

10:22:21.860 --> 10:22:30.020
yeah basically if I flip my sleep on purpose I can get so much stuff done before stream starts

10:22:30.020 --> 10:22:35.700
and then also the fun part about that is I can start stream and be like I did this and this and

10:22:35.700 --> 10:22:40.260
this and this and you've got this to look forward to whereas now it's like I've got all of this to do

10:22:40.260 --> 10:22:46.740
after which is like causing a lot of yes not major issues like issues for me

10:22:47.620 --> 10:22:57.460
because I'm supposed to do the ASMR audio like the audio upload today but I'm gonna be honest

10:22:57.460 --> 10:23:04.260
I think it'll be tomorrow but I think reeflings are like super understanding if it's like a day late

10:23:05.540 --> 10:23:12.580
all right well I think I think everyone like understand whereas if I flip my sleep now wow

10:23:12.660 --> 10:23:23.060
if I flip stop if I flipped my sleep now I would be able to do it since I wake up and like guarantee

10:23:23.060 --> 10:23:28.020
the fails like they're uploaded and I'll be like all the fail ups you know uploads at 9am my time

10:23:28.020 --> 10:23:35.220
like it's there it's waiting to go I am getting tired but I can do it I can do it wait what about

10:23:35.540 --> 10:23:42.020
what about the future in audio uh it's gonna be tomorrow I think instead of today is that okay

10:23:43.860 --> 10:23:46.580
I'm not really like that I'm not allowed to do that

10:23:50.980 --> 10:23:58.100
unacceptable unsubscribe unless you're reported honestly most inconsistent streamer streamer

10:23:58.180 --> 10:24:07.860

10:52:24.580 --> 10:52:32.100
insta die doesn't matter you can hear um any tower can be a hidden tower

10:52:36.580 --> 10:52:40.820
leave us alone we're just traveling reeflings we're ain't dropping no eaves sir

10:52:41.060 --> 10:52:57.140
that was a quote from Samwise Gamgee from Lord of the Ring

10:53:03.620 --> 10:53:05.620
well let's take this woman to bed and tuck her in

10:53:06.340 --> 10:53:08.980
you know you want to plop me in bed after all this screaming

10:53:10.740 --> 10:53:15.060
she's randomly recording Lord of the Ring she's done for it's ogre

10:53:16.580 --> 10:53:24.740
well there's an end there's an end there's a merry old man beneath the old gray hill

10:53:25.620 --> 10:53:33.220
and there they brought a beer so brown the man and the man himself came down one night to drink his

10:53:33.220 --> 10:53:42.660
so oh hey diddle diddle played their wiefling on the fiddle a jake that would wake the dead

10:53:42.660 --> 10:53:48.900
as he squeaked in his floating egg within this trend and the landlord tricked the man on the mid

10:53:54.180 --> 10:53:56.340
oh it's this creepy woman village

10:53:57.060 --> 10:54:06.180
oh i missed we all miss unanimously our bad chief our bad always in greece

10:54:07.780 --> 10:54:12.020

10:54:12.020 --> 10:54:13.300
wait is the zero still up

10:54:17.140 --> 10:54:22.020

10:54:39.940 --> 10:54:42.020

10:54:45.620 --> 10:54:50.260
oh sorry i forget my flask is like super strong now i don't need to like chug them

10:54:51.220 --> 10:54:55.940
like glug glug glug glug glug as there's an instrument as long as you have today three streams

10:54:55.940 --> 10:55:02.820
back to back to back as they're the endurance uh the hidden endurance streamer actually and you

10:55:04.820 --> 10:55:06.420
as long as she's happy that's the main thing

10:55:09.940 --> 10:55:14.020
i've been fighting with the copyright system in azura azura actually sings

10:55:14.740 --> 10:55:18.740
so well when you know how she just like her random humming and all of that

10:55:18.740 --> 10:55:23.860
she actually sings so well she's uh got been caught by the copyright system who the

10:55:24.740 --> 10:55:32.260
who's doing this who reveal yourself at once oh trebuchet's are back

10:55:35.940 --> 10:55:41.540
another seed oh my god there's so many seeds here okay make sure you don't get hit by trebuchet though

10:55:42.420 --> 10:55:45.460
right i think there's a safe station up here

10:55:49.460 --> 10:55:53.300
i want to say there is oh no you're leading me this way sorry you're leading me this way

10:55:53.300 --> 10:55:59.140
and there's something here and they're invented singing so they're actually just yanking it from

10:55:59.140 --> 10:56:04.820
her so there's an instrument

10:56:08.260 --> 10:56:12.180
hope her monetization stream went well i don't know what happened but i hope it was good and

10:56:12.180 --> 10:56:17.220
she was having good time i don't even know what diddle she made she sent me like a little preview

10:56:17.220 --> 10:56:21.380

10:56:54.980 --> 10:57:00.020
me damage bar is coming on i'm getting scared she's too good for you ships to handle she posted

10:57:00.020 --> 10:57:06.740
the diddles on swear oh nicole tried it oh uh it's a very quick twitter and then i'll talk to myself

10:57:06.740 --> 10:57:07.700
in a bit to the back

10:57:12.740 --> 10:57:15.700
her stream was awesome oh i'm so glad she even did me

10:57:21.060 --> 10:57:24.100
i wish i could have been there to annoy her and be like

10:57:25.700 --> 10:57:32.260
and i want to request a new happy on the beach in the Bahamas i'd be like that's not doodle that's

10:57:32.260 --> 10:57:38.740
a whole extra mission i'm like yeah you're right i'm sorry you're right i'm sorry

10:57:41.380 --> 10:57:47.220
it's your profile pic wait did she like proper doodle at the wazoo i said to her you you might

10:57:47.220 --> 10:57:53.460
need to be careful like kind of zoom in past something um but i would absolutely love to

10:57:53.460 --> 10:57:57.940
see more doodle streams i'm probably gonna watch her monetization stream if i have time

10:57:58.900 --> 10:58:04.500
uh because i i don't know about you guys i absolutely love doodle request streams i find

10:58:04.500 --> 10:58:11.780
them like so adorable oh look it's a reefling putting me to bed look there it's you see my

10:58:11.780 --> 10:58:17.300
sword pointing to us for real for real that's what you look like when you pull me to bed

10:58:17.860 --> 10:58:26.740
uh anyway i'm a simp for a little doodle stream oh i got lightning ram

10:58:30.420 --> 10:58:32.100
did you beat a ram up with lightning

10:58:47.380 --> 10:58:52.900
um

10:58:56.100 --> 10:58:58.900
sorry my brain's shutting down only i'm gonna pretend otherwise

10:59:00.500 --> 10:59:08.820
running diagnostic three issues found critical failure in the butthole critical failure in the brain

10:59:08.820 --> 10:59:18.580
i'm enjoying being a bit free unless i have to admit wait where's my third critical failure

10:59:19.620 --> 10:59:27.700
oh there's a yes hello oh you're oh i just oh look look look look apparently

10:59:27.700 --> 10:59:29.700
i'm

10:59:29.940 --> 10:59:38.020
for a reefling right now nightly a reefling well yours uh where are we heading to next

10:59:40.180 --> 10:59:47.380
i might confess a little bit to the tiredness slowly coming into me i don't remember feeling

10:59:47.380 --> 10:59:52.740
as tired on other stuff on this and just wait you've got a torch that means i follow you if you've

10:59:52.740 --> 10:59:56.820
got a torch but you know where it goes you both know where it goes

11:00:00.180 --> 11:00:04.260
where's the other reefing i'm missing a reef i found the other reefing

11:00:06.500 --> 11:00:11.700
i think the last years are in the realm of the giants so you'd have to clear marg yet to get there

11:00:11.700 --> 11:00:15.220
if only i had some mlg pro reeflings

11:00:15.220 --> 11:00:20.420
uh if only

11:00:26.260 --> 11:00:26.900
truly

11:00:30.100 --> 11:00:37.620
okay so then once all my flaws are not our level dot we shall do the dlc

11:00:39.700 --> 11:00:42.900
and we'll see if we can go back to that guy that's absolutely well within us

11:00:43.620 --> 11:00:46.420
at least i can heal no that's probably the biggest thing

11:00:50.580 --> 11:00:54.740
i was gonna be mean in clip i am insent out of my face but i didn't ask you

11:00:56.580 --> 11:00:58.660
on me did i say that

11:01:01.540 --> 11:01:09.540
was she in kaolin uh yes we did kaolin we're now moving on to the giants

11:01:10.340 --> 11:01:11.380
realm maybe

11:01:14.660 --> 11:01:17.460
true you seem a lot more set up now than i did a few years

11:01:17.460 --> 11:01:24.900
yes so maybe we could quickly sneak into the dlc just to see what's ahead of us

11:01:25.860 --> 11:01:31.060
i can't remember even what we got stuck on and we're just getting walloped in general

11:01:31.620 --> 11:01:33.620
oh

11:01:39.140 --> 11:01:40.420
i think i'll grab that on the way

11:01:42.100 --> 11:01:43.620
oh he's so tired

11:01:46.420 --> 11:01:53.300
we're claiming the mountain plain well we're in a fight apparently

11:01:54.180 --> 11:01:56.900
oh what's this

11:01:57.860 --> 11:02:03.300
who or what why are we fighting oh it's you and for the reefling

11:02:04.260 --> 11:02:10.260
whoa no it's not oh we're not bothering you so don't bother us how about that

11:02:16.260 --> 11:02:18.820
i wonder what the originals games were like

11:02:21.140 --> 11:02:22.900
is it the same development team

11:02:23.860 --> 11:02:30.340
i would be curious i don't know if any franchises ever lasted like that even have the same developers

11:02:30.340 --> 11:02:35.860
like on multiple editions it's sorry multiple renditions or storylines of the game unless it's

11:02:35.860 --> 11:02:44.180
like indie owned that's probably the only instance 11 hours did you know memory loss is one of the

11:02:44.180 --> 11:02:50.420
signs of insomnia just saying not really into anything yeah i don't have insomnia okay there

11:02:50.420 --> 11:02:56.340
we can't progress because we're looting into a new area but i can see uh site ahead of me

11:02:59.540 --> 11:03:01.620
you're thinking why why must they go

11:03:07.140 --> 11:03:10.260
something maybe hunting us then look at the longer sword

11:03:11.620 --> 11:03:16.100
it's so pointy as well that's dangerous good it's jaggy too so as well

11:03:20.660 --> 11:03:24.100
i see them just summoning you then some

11:03:24.100 --> 11:03:26.100
summon them

11:03:30.820 --> 11:03:34.740
let's discover this and maybe let's upgrade into another class

11:03:36.260 --> 11:03:38.740
if someone wins some day i have no idea what you're talking about

11:03:40.660 --> 11:03:44.180
no i don't have insomnia i just i have bad

11:03:44.340 --> 11:03:47.300
rest asleep at the moment just a little hmm so many things

11:03:49.380 --> 11:03:53.780
but it will come down to tm oh we can talk to millenials

11:03:55.700 --> 11:04:02.100
my lady spoken echoes of queen marica linger here as well

11:04:02.740 --> 11:04:09.940
shall i share them with you yes please and marica's own words hear me demigods

11:04:10.900 --> 11:04:21.300
my children beloved make of themselves that which he desire be it a lord be it a god

11:04:21.940 --> 11:04:31.540
but should he fail to become awed at all you will be forsaken amounting only to sacrifices

11:04:32.340 --> 11:04:40.500
so basically if you don't become something big you're gonna be meat for the tarnished

11:04:42.340 --> 11:04:47.700
um curious there's a difficult boss up ahead

11:04:48.900 --> 11:04:59.060
oh yeah if only i had some backup but who have i not had them you weren't in last thing no

11:05:01.780 --> 11:05:05.140
where's panini in last time you're getting called panini

11:05:06.180 --> 11:05:12.340
hi i'm getting delirious but we're gonna do it we're gonna oh i'm not had you in a hot second

11:05:12.340 --> 11:05:16.180
either oh no there was a new one here sugar i don't know if that was someone who's not

11:05:16.180 --> 11:05:18.580
being in for a while but thank you for your patience

11:05:22.260 --> 11:05:29.220
at east we are all getting incredibly delirious at this stage i think however we're leveling

11:05:29.220 --> 11:05:36.420
up my flasks and stuff so we can actually do the dlc area because we may or may not have got

11:05:36.420 --> 11:05:42.500
absolutely whacked uh oh hydration check actually so i don't break my voice

11:05:43.380 --> 11:05:45.780
wow what i dropped my voice

11:05:54.980 --> 11:05:59.060
don't overdo it i've literally got 50 minutes i got less than 50 minutes now

11:06:00.420 --> 11:06:07.780
okay and first we do our righteous ceremony should it have i got a run up i do have a wee

11:06:07.780 --> 11:06:14.020
bit of a run up just a little one though oh good

11:06:16.420 --> 11:06:19.860
i wish i could turn that thing so cool it almost like the base and it's like

11:06:23.780 --> 11:06:27.380
okay where are we heading follow the stuff like

11:06:27.940 --> 11:06:29.460
like

11:06:35.460 --> 11:06:39.460
time to take a new one oh oh i didn't realize there was enemies all over here

11:06:40.740 --> 11:06:43.460
jeez there's so many lovely flowers though i love it

11:06:43.460 --> 11:06:52.340
who's that

11:06:56.580 --> 11:07:01.700
who are you and who do you think you're talking to by an attitude like that

11:07:04.500 --> 11:07:07.620
honestly being scared of a tarnish are you

11:07:07.940 --> 11:07:15.860
honestly then you then it even be disrespectful the guy from the braided

11:07:17.460 --> 11:07:21.300
up here i want medallion

11:07:25.300 --> 11:07:29.380
greatly raises maximum stamina but come on

11:07:30.100 --> 11:07:36.500
game team one point look at our sacrifice

11:07:39.700 --> 11:07:44.500
oh good good good no i'm not yawning it's it's actually just an audio

11:07:45.140 --> 11:07:50.100
a sensory process and issues oh there's another thing oh there's two golden seats here

11:07:51.140 --> 11:07:54.660
that's pretty cool uh we're heading over here

11:08:00.020 --> 11:08:08.340
i'm following the flame they're truly yawning simulation yeah it's just like because of the

11:08:08.340 --> 11:08:14.100
whole hypnosis thing it probably sounds like yawning but i'm actually just straight up rewiring

11:08:14.100 --> 11:08:20.020
your brain to do my bidding at any point in time um and i'm actually getting so good

11:08:21.060 --> 11:08:27.300
that you can't even tell when i'm tapping into your cerebral cortex like i'm already in there

11:08:27.860 --> 11:08:31.460
the reason why i'm telling you this right now is because you're not even going to remember

11:08:31.460 --> 11:08:38.900
me telling you so any emotions that you feel of shock of despair there's no point because you're

11:08:38.900 --> 11:08:46.100
you're not going to remember or feel it again in about 15 minutes time it's a relaxed battle cry

11:08:46.100 --> 11:08:53.220
that's actually really creative is that why i'm watching you all day every day recently

11:08:53.220 --> 11:08:57.060
i'm already in we're even done the hypnosis for you well i've done a little

11:08:58.100 --> 11:09:04.500
someone really complimented my like asmr hypnosis i did by accident when i wasn't like yawning on it

11:09:04.500 --> 11:09:11.300
whoa two golden seats i guess the game's like yeah you gonna need this touch three

11:09:16.900 --> 11:09:21.780
stony keeps saying she hasn't done any hypnosis yet but that's all we remember truth is

11:09:21.780 --> 11:09:26.740
we were hypnotized before debut are you clicking your fingers for hypnosis

11:09:28.820 --> 11:09:33.700
okay we're a little bit against the clock so i'm gonna have to be good and get going

11:09:35.140 --> 11:09:40.180
i get going and be good i think this is around the point when you need like six

11:09:40.260 --> 11:09:41.620
beats for a plaster song

11:09:48.500 --> 11:09:54.020
i don't know what she's on my head why do you think you're so selfless towards me huh

11:09:55.220 --> 11:09:58.580
how are we playing why do you think you're so selfless to carry me through the game

11:09:59.380 --> 11:10:03.460
carry me through of the stuff i want to explore the other reason

11:10:06.900 --> 11:10:07.700
it's like we got in

11:10:10.660 --> 11:10:11.160
a

11:10:19.460 --> 11:10:20.980
i just did three really good

11:10:22.820 --> 11:10:24.020
what is going on

11:10:26.420 --> 11:10:34.900
i braped for one second and oh sorry sorry what is you i don't remember going against this

11:10:34.980 --> 11:10:37.220
did you guys carry me through him last time

11:10:41.140 --> 11:10:42.100
oh my goodness

11:10:44.740 --> 11:10:46.500
i do not remember going against that

11:10:48.740 --> 11:10:50.900
and a golden seat from him too

11:10:51.940 --> 11:10:54.420
to hike this entire area is a gold mine

11:10:56.500 --> 11:10:58.820
a golden seat mine

11:11:00.500 --> 11:11:04.500
there's a pun there somewhere but it's not gonna work in zen structure of english

11:11:05.620 --> 11:11:08.180
we didn't kill any of these yeah i don't even remember him

11:11:11.460 --> 11:11:12.660
can't wait for more hypnosis

11:11:14.340 --> 11:11:20.500
i think on the writing stream we're gonna get a lot of work done on the writing stream

11:11:20.500 --> 11:11:24.980
but like good work not like boring work like the work you want to hear

11:11:26.180 --> 11:11:30.820
hopefully it's not boring if it is obviously i don't have to do a stream like that again

11:11:30.820 --> 11:11:32.980
i don't want to like bore you

11:11:38.340 --> 11:11:42.340
you don't need every golden seat to max out class you need 30 to get 14

11:11:43.540 --> 11:11:46.900
okay that's fair oh you got a 14 flat

11:11:49.940 --> 11:11:55.140
right however we pick up the next and then we'll go back in the dlc and see what we're looking at

11:11:56.100 --> 11:11:58.260
what the situation in hand is

11:12:00.260 --> 11:12:02.980
because i don't know if it's going to be as bad as i remember

11:12:04.020 --> 11:12:11.940
but maybe we go for smithing stones next or if we just focus and behave and see what happens

11:12:18.020 --> 11:12:18.900
i'm not going that way

11:12:19.220 --> 11:12:24.420
i'm never born as always a good thing

11:12:25.140 --> 11:12:29.060
i feel like when i get sleepy though i ain't i ain't doing my best you know i ain't beating

11:12:29.060 --> 11:12:33.620
everything out the way i should or like being a gift ball and coming up with like all my

11:12:33.620 --> 11:12:38.500
my little tangents like disappear because my brain's like i'm too tired to even connect one

11:12:39.220 --> 11:12:43.620
one real reference or something similar to what you've just read good night

11:12:49.140 --> 11:12:51.140

the battlefield wait are we just on a massive u-turn

11:13:16.980 --> 11:13:18.100
i think we might have

11:13:21.060 --> 11:13:22.020
the press giant

11:13:25.540 --> 11:13:27.940
i almost killed that boss but he's still beating me up

11:13:30.340 --> 11:13:34.180
maybe i should raid into your guys's games and be the fighter

11:13:35.140 --> 11:13:39.140
although that'd be really hard to stream but it no

11:13:41.060 --> 11:13:43.380
it's a wagon i remember

11:13:48.420 --> 11:13:49.220

11:16:47.220 --> 11:16:55.060

11:16:55.060 --> 11:16:56.420
and no one's gonna like it

11:17:01.300 --> 11:17:05.220

it's hard to tell him to listen at all that's the only

11:18:46.260 --> 11:18:50.180

we can't go back

11:20:48.340 --> 11:20:58.420

11:22:54.740 --> 11:22:59.460
the soundboard audio is doubled oh it comes out of desktop and stream thick

11:22:59.700 --> 11:23:00.180
thing

11:23:08.500 --> 11:23:11.540
there's only one reefling that can able to do this at the location

11:23:13.540 --> 11:23:16.740
did i miss the map i've i'm not discovered it yet

11:23:18.900 --> 11:23:20.820
it must be up ahead wherever the heck i am

11:23:21.220 --> 11:23:26.020
i can go i'm gonna just wait okay i wait

11:23:26.020 --> 11:23:29.940

11:23:31.460 --> 11:23:37.060
i'm gonna change what do you want is it nice i like polite by both

11:23:37.860 --> 11:23:42.580
to be my sin if you're at disadvantage anything the girls do it's all me it's all me

11:23:43.380 --> 11:23:47.140
oh nothing oh

11:23:52.900 --> 11:23:57.620
i guess people at the end game can't get some in here wait really

11:23:59.940 --> 11:24:02.660
i just woke up and you're so going god you're so precious

11:24:03.220 --> 11:24:05.940
stop it reefling you're precious do the reason why i have strength

11:24:06.900 --> 11:24:07.940
oh sorry wrong one

11:24:10.980 --> 11:24:14.980
i think you're the only there's only one more reefling that can make it

11:24:16.260 --> 11:24:19.300
it's because the city changes after the realm of the giant

11:24:24.820 --> 11:24:28.340
it's not looking good i put down a sign

11:24:29.140 --> 11:24:31.380
is your password

11:24:35.940 --> 11:24:39.540
every time look i gotta bless the reeflings before i send them in

11:24:44.100 --> 11:24:50.420
oh no i think the game's really limited you're gonna have to carry everything

11:24:50.420 --> 11:24:54.740
reefling like no pressure if you're the only one that can load in you have to carry this entire

11:24:54.820 --> 11:25:00.660
section i guess if we burned the tree we would actually be in a different area

11:25:01.220 --> 11:25:08.660
oh no okay we have a second reefling i don't know if any invaders can make it i don't think so

11:25:08.660 --> 11:25:17.300
i think everyone's cooked so we need to try and get through this area as fast as possible

11:25:17.380 --> 11:25:19.060
without being invaded somehow

11:25:24.180 --> 11:25:27.060
i'll literally we need to do as fast as possible are we ready

11:25:28.420 --> 11:25:33.540
oh wait no there is a reefling there's a reefling that can be the invader oh my god we don't have

11:25:33.540 --> 11:25:35.460
to like panic thank god

11:25:39.460 --> 11:25:41.140
i'm getting nervous i'm getting shaky

11:25:42.100 --> 11:25:46.100
this is the east coast patrol rampart

11:25:49.700 --> 11:25:53.140
look at my cloak honestly i need a quilt creature right now

11:25:53.700 --> 11:26:00.580
i'm so down for our quilt oh we're safe we're safe we don't have to worry about people beating us up

11:26:00.580 --> 11:26:06.420
right are we ready reefling i don't know where we're going or what we're doing but let's do it

11:26:06.420 --> 11:26:10.420
let's do it a quick adventure try a minute adventure reefling

11:26:20.420 --> 11:26:22.660
i'm guessing if we go this way open the door

11:26:25.380 --> 11:26:27.380
it does not do a single thing like that

11:26:29.540 --> 11:26:34.900
okay we're beating up snowmen we said global warming

11:26:36.420 --> 11:26:41.940
rid of them snowmen right now i got 10 no i got one 10 i can't bring

11:26:46.420 --> 11:26:47.380
which is easy

11:26:51.780 --> 11:26:55.700
oh he's a chicken nuggy he's got knee arms knee legs and he looks in the castle

11:26:57.460 --> 11:27:04.340
oh my gosh this room's gorgeous look at all the plants it's just like the farm food thing

11:27:04.340 --> 11:27:10.420
i'm gonna have all these plants around and then when you come home tired from work i'm going to

11:27:10.420 --> 11:27:16.660
tell you all about my plants and you're gonna be like god she's so dumb i want to fight her

11:27:17.620 --> 11:27:18.900
and it's the good life for her

11:27:27.140 --> 11:27:32.980
oh oh no reefling reefling quickly quickly so you don't take fall damage

11:27:33.860 --> 11:27:35.300
okay that was good reefling

11:27:37.460 --> 11:27:38.820
the sea collection grows

11:27:40.340 --> 11:27:47.220
capital area so i think because it shows like mild civilization in between like all this death

11:27:47.220 --> 11:27:58.660
and decay uh possible because i always wonder i'm always like how how do people travel in the

11:27:59.140 --> 11:28:05.220
roof and stuff in this game because isn't it too dangerous for the average person because if

11:28:05.220 --> 11:28:09.220
we're having to do all of this stuff or is it the average person like everyone has to learn

11:28:09.220 --> 11:28:16.980
like some sort of skill or craft and in order to like go anywhere there's no cities

11:28:17.380 --> 11:28:21.460
oh sorry sorry

11:28:26.100 --> 11:28:36.740
but it's oh sorry am i gonna just wall try something oh i think i'm not very uh

11:28:37.060 --> 11:28:39.060
this is magic unfortunately that's

11:28:46.980 --> 11:28:50.660
happy being those games are always basically supposed to pull off everything's falling apart

11:28:50.660 --> 11:28:57.220
not to stay for anymore um okay i'm gonna say like how do you people eat

11:28:59.460 --> 11:29:05.860
like i don't see any farms the carrot is growing aren't you guys hungry

11:29:07.460 --> 11:29:10.260
like who sits up the food does anyone even eat

11:29:11.620 --> 11:29:16.020
does anyone even need to eat maybe it's like a car okay you guys have split one reefling

11:29:16.020 --> 11:29:22.260
two reeflings are gone oh there's a fight hold on are we fighting or are we

11:29:24.180 --> 11:29:26.020
okay we're fighting we need to help that reefling

11:29:28.340 --> 11:29:30.100
don't wait you carefully dodge that

11:29:30.900 --> 11:29:36.420
uh i will say i pressed b but i was already locked into the big boy animation okay

11:29:39.940 --> 11:29:41.140
i'm sorry i just blocked you

11:29:43.540 --> 11:29:45.700
okay when they're taking a critical you actually can't

11:29:48.900 --> 11:29:54.020
there's a guy on the stairs as well over to him where are you going

11:29:54.180 --> 11:30:03.380
oh this grace had a lot of problems i don't think i can summon you guys properly after that

11:30:05.380 --> 11:30:08.900
i feel like run through this whole area on my own

11:30:10.420 --> 11:30:14.500
it's not even in some big on my own i had to run through this whole area

11:30:14.500 --> 11:30:19.620
i'm scared there's actually a lot of areas in the like later game

11:30:20.180 --> 11:30:30.260
that you can't hit anything wait oh there's an enemy there oh no sorry they weren't even

11:30:30.260 --> 11:30:32.180

11:31:25.780 --> 11:31:29.700
empire like it's got the old scale you've already

11:31:39.860 --> 11:31:42.580
rune art that helps me in fate

11:31:49.700 --> 11:31:51.220

11:31:54.900 --> 11:31:57.220
i've laced in 25 minutes when it seems like i'm going to be dead

11:31:59.540 --> 11:32:00.740
please don't fall off the map

11:32:05.460 --> 11:32:05.940
do you mind

11:32:07.620 --> 11:32:11.380
don't hurt my wraithlings don't give them jump scares either that's not nice

11:32:12.180 --> 11:32:20.980
i think we can keep going

11:32:24.820 --> 11:32:26.020
okay there's a bit of a fate

11:32:28.580 --> 11:32:29.540

11:32:31.700 --> 11:32:36.500

11:32:45.220 --> 11:32:45.620
flying

11:32:48.340 --> 11:32:49.620
it's going for my bullsack

11:32:54.020 --> 11:32:54.580
have you gone

11:32:56.260 --> 11:32:58.900
no it's targeting me and i'm in a corner this is a terrible idea

11:32:59.620 --> 11:33:00.900
i

11:33:05.700 --> 11:33:07.220
i just healed the undead

11:33:15.700 --> 11:33:18.980
i like welcome welcome welcome oh wait it's a week

11:33:20.900 --> 11:33:24.660
i'm so happy here okay we go to seed

11:33:26.660 --> 11:33:27.540
there we go

11:33:29.860 --> 11:33:39.380
uh whatever do seamless co-op mod um i would have to do it with one of the girls because

11:33:39.380 --> 11:33:45.620
i think there's ip issues if i did it like that whereas when doing it this way it is through

11:33:47.300 --> 11:33:47.540
and

11:33:50.260 --> 11:33:53.540
it's through the servers which keeps me safe as strummer

11:33:54.260 --> 11:34:00.500
oh they can jump i was like haven't seen you over here they can jump

11:34:01.620 --> 11:34:07.700
it's not i think it's not a crazy concept that any of you can jump but you did see here

11:34:07.860 --> 11:34:09.860
it's

11:34:24.260 --> 11:34:25.860
we are beating up these plant men

11:34:27.860 --> 11:34:30.660
i suppose it's mushroom if it's the score it's not plant them

11:34:31.620 --> 11:34:38.420
oh no is there not a save point no there's only a save point after the fight

11:34:41.540 --> 11:34:42.820
is this a solo fight

11:34:48.740 --> 11:34:50.980
seamless yeah i was going to do seamless with sin

11:34:51.300 --> 11:34:58.980
oh no right i don't know if you guys can come in i hope you can

11:35:02.020 --> 11:35:05.300
oh thank god i get so nervous

11:35:20.980 --> 11:35:27.300
um

11:35:38.740 --> 11:35:44.260
i actually like his attack pattern because i have enough brain power to like respond a little bit

11:35:44.260 --> 11:35:46.900
now i know i'm getting walloped don't get me wrong but

11:35:47.860 --> 11:35:52.020
do i need to bring him in the open i think we need to bring him in the open a bit

11:35:56.180 --> 11:36:01.620
he's like really swinging weirdly in that way which i think they're like hitting us so well

11:36:07.220 --> 11:36:08.180
okay it's rolling pit

11:36:08.180 --> 11:36:12.020
okay hold on

11:36:15.540 --> 11:36:17.300
oh he changes like the last second

11:36:18.260 --> 11:36:24.980
oh wow i feel like that's going to when he's lost on the ground is pretty cool

11:36:26.580 --> 11:36:30.020
play safe and heal again oh i said i'm gonna play a safe and heal again

11:36:32.020 --> 11:36:38.020
oh my gosh okay god free has been banked there we got it i got

11:36:38.740 --> 11:36:44.180
poachers thank you replays okay what can we put on we just put on

11:36:45.540 --> 11:36:50.580
the critical hit one because it probably got gone right now are you coming out no the game's just

11:36:50.580 --> 11:36:52.820
yeah i was gonna say the game's just slowly kicking you out

11:36:57.700 --> 11:37:00.740
the spawns you're tanking i'm literally just tanking all the hits

11:37:01.540 --> 11:37:06.740
it's a lovely ds on this sheening i just connected to the very last second

11:37:07.700 --> 11:37:09.460
i mean it worked out um

11:37:11.300 --> 11:37:13.620
can't what what do we do now

11:37:15.620 --> 11:37:19.780
did i just talk for the last bit i don't think we have enough time to like achieve anything

11:37:19.780 --> 11:37:25.540
do you have time for margot only if you guys can like fucking bum rush them

11:37:27.700 --> 11:37:31.540
do you want me to go is it this way i'll go to get margett up on those stairs

11:37:31.700 --> 11:37:32.500
i don't go there

11:37:35.940 --> 11:37:38.500
oh no my bavish goes up past the way

11:37:42.420 --> 11:37:49.380
up to you i guess and i can't spawn you guys at this one up the tree branch this tree branch

11:37:49.380 --> 11:37:50.260
right here

11:37:54.660 --> 11:37:58.340
let's see if we have time i don't want to corrupt the vod though that's the only thing

11:37:59.300 --> 11:38:00.900
it annoys me so much

11:38:07.460 --> 11:38:08.660
all the babushkas

11:38:10.340 --> 11:38:12.660
there's a wee bastard ahead i remember him

11:38:17.220 --> 11:38:19.780
do i have enough IQ to kill him right now i don't know

11:38:22.020 --> 11:38:25.380
i don't think i have enough is that great can i ignore him

11:38:25.940 --> 11:38:33.780
wait i can summon you why corrupt the vod um for some reason if it goes at over 11 hours

11:38:42.180 --> 11:38:43.140
is that all you've got

11:38:45.300 --> 11:38:52.740
um for some reason after the 11 hour mark the thing 11 hours and 55 minutes the vod

11:38:52.740 --> 11:38:58.900
becomes corrupted even though you can still stream appropriately i could keep streaming past it

11:38:58.900 --> 11:39:05.060
and you guys would see it fine but if someone comes to watch it it doesn't like it like at all

11:39:08.180 --> 11:39:12.740
wait is it is that someone over there riefling why are you all the way over here is that you

11:39:13.620 --> 11:39:17.780

11:39:27.940 --> 11:39:33.620
okay okay you guys are gonna have to like wipe him out

11:39:35.540 --> 11:39:39.940

11:43:57.220 --> 11:44:04.500
safe station down touch the wall of thorns impenetrable thorns refuse all none may enter the urge tree

11:44:05.700 --> 11:44:11.300

11:44:28.980 --> 11:44:29.780
hi darling

11:44:31.940 --> 11:44:40.740
hello again old friend allow me a moment to converse with you you are unable to enter the urge

11:44:40.740 --> 11:44:49.700
tree no you're prevented by the mantle of bars the thorns are impenetrable a husk of the urge

11:44:49.700 --> 11:44:57.140
trees being that spurns all that exists without the only way to stand before the elden ring

11:44:57.780 --> 11:45:07.860
and become the elden lord is to pass the thorns my purpose serves to aid in that very act

11:45:08.580 --> 11:45:17.940
so i'd like you to undertake a new journey with me to the flame of ruin far above the clouds

11:45:18.740 --> 11:45:26.820
upon the snowy mountaintops of the giant so i can't remember i can set the urge tree a flame

11:45:26.900 --> 11:45:32.980
she still stays with me after the burn to becoming elden or am i being dumb

11:45:32.980 --> 11:45:35.140
she doesn't say with me after the burn

11:45:38.660 --> 11:45:45.700
uh shall i turn your rooms to strength maybe let my hand rest upon you now for her to

11:45:46.100 --> 11:45:56.820
wait a moment share them with me your thoughts your ambitions the principles you would follow

11:45:59.220 --> 11:46:01.780
you have to like chaos take the world and burn the tree that way

11:46:04.020 --> 11:46:08.100
but she's unhappy if you do i don't want her to be upset with this

11:46:08.500 --> 11:46:12.900
