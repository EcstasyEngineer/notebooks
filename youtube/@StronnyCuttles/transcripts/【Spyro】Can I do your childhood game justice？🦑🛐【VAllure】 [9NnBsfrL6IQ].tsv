0	2640	lea wearing the bodyguard
24040	27240	hallo
27240	29240	you hear me get him
29240	37840	Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. We just trying not to be so loud for once in
37840	45200	a while. Does your dad use those fancy made up scotch words like gobsheet and bampo? A
45200	51920	wee bit. He's much worse lying than me. Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. I'm
51920	63880	trying to be a wee bit quieter. But that's because my dad's here. I'm trying to be so
63880	75120	quiet. I think he's still asleep. So, but I had the worst day ever yesterday. I'm so
75120	80800	sorry I couldn't tell you. I didn't want anyone tracking his flight. I didn't want
80800	90280	any weirdness. So my dad's here. I was violently car sick yesterday. So I feel awful. I've
90280	95440	had five hours sleep. I didn't have my nap. I don't even know if I've had five hours straight
95440	100440	to be honest. But we're gonna we're gonna figure out this game one way or another. So this
100440	109400	is Spyro, which may or may not be your childhood game. Because it's not mine. It's still my
109480	119480	game. My master. No, I've not played it before. So Crash Bandicoot got remastered and so did
119480	124720	Spyro. So I don't know if it's the same studio or if it was just rival studios that were
124720	129360	smart enough to re-release classic games. Like if they re-release cameo. So I'm jumping
129360	136360	right back on that. Thank you for streaming despite being a game, but also self care one.
136360	146200	Well, I have, I don't know what we're gonna do about ASMR streams because so my dad passed
146200	154800	out and he's got his own room in over him. And his snoring is so loud. I don't think I
154800	163840	can do ASMR for the next three weeks. I'm really unsure what's gonna happen. I beat the second
164000	170000	Spyro over at my best friend's house. I'm surprised you never played this. I don't know if Spyro
170000	178600	came out after, I mean before Crash Bandicoot. There we go. I have no idea. No dad snoring
178600	184120	ASMR. Oh, he like proper snores the house then. The bloody cats are scared of him. Gimli
184120	193280	and Vigo didn't come out. But yeah, I'm so sorry for the entire, we're gonna give Spyro
193360	203360	a shot. I assume it's Spyro the dragon I'm supposed to do, right? Yeah, seems right. That
203360	210280	was fine. 100% question mark. They need to get used to them. Yeah, they do not. Gimli
210280	212080	and Vigo. Oh my god, they have cutscenes.
212080	222640	Okay, rolling. Oh, it's been peaceful here in the five worlds, or is it six? For a dragon
222640	231280	to eat, you now have 12,000 treasure, or is it 14,000? What about this Ganasty Gannok
231280	238240	character? Now, I'm a Ganasty magic spell to turn gems into warriors for his cause. I'll
239040	252400	gentle confirmed. Wait. So yeah, I'm gonna give your childhood game a shot. See what I think,
252400	256640	because I share my childhood game all the time, so it's time for me to play a new game.
257360	270320	Wait, they have old music. Wait, why didn't... Oh, he talks.
276880	278400	Wait, why didn't he make me green?
278720	286320	Is this a remake of the original Spyro? It is.
294160	300800	So X is charged, B is flamed. Is it unlimited? I don't really see a bar. What's Y?
301040	308320	What's Y? X at look. Hold on, sorry. Wait, right trigger is attack as well.
310800	317280	What's this? Rescued nest. I didn't do anything. I walked forward, sir. Please,
317280	319680	please do not give me more accolades for things I didn't do.
323680	329040	Oh my god. Thank you, hit Vocaloid, Iniku Hatsune, for becoming a member.
331760	337840	What about NastyNork? I'm going after him. I'm going to find dragons first.
337840	340560	That's all I can tell you. Right, we're to find dragons.
342720	348400	I mean, I think it's as simple as that. I'm going to say no. Right, there's a green one over there.
348400	356400	Oh, I can fly with wings. Delvin. That Miku? Oh my god, she literally...
356400	361600	NastyNork out towards you. Keep your horns on, Spyro. You have much to learn.
361600	365440	So I'm a baby dragon. Do you know what the dragon fly following you is doing?
367120	373440	His name is Sparks and he's helping me protect you. Keep an eye on him and see what I mean.
374000	377520	Please... where is this?
379840	380640	Oh, I missed.
387760	392480	Wait, I can't touch water? Is it because I'm a dragon?
393120	406160	Okay, sorry, I'm just getting used to this. I've almost perished because I'm a dumber.
407920	411920	Oh, I'm locked to place. Do I want to go there? Does it matter where you go?
413360	417760	I do see portals going out and Joes don't read your health.
418480	420880	Oh, he looks so messed up.
422400	426000	Old video games and conditions to expect water to always be lethal.
426000	432000	Literally, I didn't realize I was hurting myself. That was a bit of an oversight from me.
434080	439680	Oh, I've got my cup of tea. Treasure found. Oh no, is this like 100% the game to progress?
439680	443120	Or is it just... you can go wherever you want. Oh, okay.
447840	452000	But yeah, how are you guys? Other than... oh my god, what?
454560	457520	Are you squid merit? I've just come for the worst, like one.
457520	460960	Mama dipping into my childhood on my 24th birthday.
460960	461520	Oh, birthday.
461520	464640	Best present ever. I hope you have a fun.
464640	467760	Oh my god, happy 24th birthday.
467760	471680	Snowberry smoothie. That's such a cute name. Thank you for the 20 as well.
471680	476240	Yeah, I'm trying to play your childhood games. Oh no, the controls are embedded.
476320	479600	I assume I go for the barrels, right? Oh gosh.
480560	484080	All right. No, okay, okay. I thought we were gonna like lose momentum or something,
484080	485600	but I'm gonna just follow the rail track.
491200	496400	But yeah, basically, I cannot travel at all. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
498560	503440	Because I'm memeing about this convention and stuff,
503520	506560	and I could hardly be in a flipping taxi.
508080	512480	Get right. Oh my god, I'm actually so smart with a heck. I love kids games.
512480	514640	I love games that are really obvious what you're supposed to do.
515840	518000	I don't know what the heck this is, but I did spot it.
522000	530720	Plus three. Time? Oh, I need it for something? Time's up. Would you like to retry?
534160	542960	Huh? I'm to do eight planes, eight chests, eight trains, and eight arches.
547120	547760	Is that not?
549600	553200	Have I just picked the hardest mission to start on? Actually, if actually.
557200	558560	I see a chest this time.
558560	564960	Oh, I'm on the floor. Oh, indeed.
566960	570080	Okay, I'm up to something else. I don't think I'm supposed to do that one first.
570720	573440	You have to get all of the things before the time runs out.
578320	581120	Right, we're not doing any flight missions. I said what I said.
581120	583600	Oh, but my health is regen. Doesn't even do anything for that.
584160	586400	Okay, what are you smelling?
588800	589600	What does he do?
590480	597840	Getting around him. That doesn't seem like a nice thing to do, but oh, they're scared of me.
599360	601200	Okay, we'll take it.
605760	608560	Getting things gives you time back though. Oh, okay.
609520	614320	Okay, let's try whatever this mission is. I'm so sorry. I really don't...
615680	620400	I don't... I don't play this game. Hopefully I do it justice.
620400	627840	And yeah, and I don't sound too sick. I had to take quills, which is anti-sickness medicine,
628720	632560	and it takes away all the saliva in your mouth, and it's still in effect right now.
632560	639520	I think it ages ago. And my mouth is all dry, and my voice is all cracked because I was talking to
639520	647840	my dad, but my freaking throat was so dry, so I completely messed up.
649840	652080	But I've got to see my dad at the airport.
653520	656240	Oh my god, the poor taxi driver. He had to stop for me twice.
656240	659120	That ram looks so menacing in the distance right now.
662640	664960	Yes, I'm drinking it. I'm gonna see if I can finish my tea.
669280	674480	My freaking thigh. Oh, that was quite the voice crack if you heard that.
675120	680880	And my freaking... I was like gagging and throwing up. I had to ask the poor taxi man to
682000	688160	go to the side of the road for me. I had to... I was like begging him to put the window down on that,
688160	692160	and I almost threw it outside the car, like down the side of the freaking thing.
692880	698480	I have really bad car sickness. It's literally my biggest weakness, you know.
698480	702720	You guys are like, oh, Strony. Oh my god, hi, little fly.
704480	709040	Strony, how do you stream every single day? That's not possible. Oh, you're so strong.
709040	715760	You're so brave. No, my biggest weakness is cars. I can't be in cars. I can't be in buses.
716480	718640	I have been on a boat and not had any issues.
721120	727040	They had to nerf me somewhere in its cars. You know how the world relies on transport
727040	732400	to get anywhere, and I just use my bike to go to the shops. Yeah, there's a reason why I'm not
732400	737200	interested. Although, I read things that said if you get motion sickness in cars, but if you're the
737200	745600	driver, you don't get the same motion sickness. I literally watch me go to a convention in a
745600	749920	America and be like, right, that's me heading off now. And it's like four weeks before. And
749920	752480	everyone's like, what the fuck? And it's because I have to get a fucking boat.
755760	760560	The mobility buff is strong. Literally, I can hardly even leave the damn house.
764000	770240	Oh, okay. You threw up four, oh, four times in the car.
770880	777280	Fuck you. I can ram you too. Hold on. Gen two ram girl confirmed.
781280	785040	Just head on collision. Oh, sorry, the camera's a bit funky.
785760	790720	Try to get used to it. There's a camera just to when I move. No, you have to constantly do the
790800	793120	right except one is speed up.
798240	801200	Right, you and you. What's this?
805600	806080	Dragon.
808480	812160	Rescued Gildas. Hello. Oh, you're a painter.
815040	815600	Go for it.
820720	824000	And try pressing the action button to drop down midflying.
825440	832800	Listen, Glading just bad flying. What's this? Can you like 100% this game? Oh, why did you spank me?
834000	839200	Well, this, if he's telling me about Glading, I assume there's another dragon somewhere here.
842320	849600	It's just a, I have about a 3D with girl for gen two. That is terrible. I really want to develop
849600	859600	a legion, like a Roman legionary. Okay. What are these? Hello. Do you have coins inside you?
863840	872000	Have to do them. Oh, wait, it's out of bounds. This is out of bounds, I think. Okay, sorry.
872800	876320	I'm being a dumb dumb. What are you?
878320	882560	Are you running away from me? Nice try. Wait, he's actually kind of fast.
885280	889440	Wait, he's got an egg on him. Can I birth more dragons?
891200	894880	I will single handedly rise the dragon population.
895680	903680	Okay, I can cut corners. Oh, we're getting closer. I actually caught a few more corners and he's done for it.
909760	916560	I've got a special egg. What did that do? Torches as the egg thieves. Did he steal from us?
917440	919920	That's a jam right here.
923280	929280	I can climb. I think I can climb. I don't know if I'm supposed to climb or not.
935680	940960	I could, I don't know if I could produce dragons. That's quite a tall order.
941680	946480	You order. I don't know if you guys are in TikTok but there's this Scottish TikTok
947520	953200	like Chinese takeaway and she's like, it's called like Rebecca Box or whatever and it's like,
953200	960560	let's pack this customer's order. But she goes like genuinely, goes like order with her voice
960560	965760	and it just reminds me of when I say wild guard. There'll be like one person that knows exactly
965760	969520	what I'm talking about and everyone else is like, what are you on about, strongy? I swear.
971840	976640	We don't need chess. Okay, wait, how many dragons are there per level?
977200	979280	Asked or? Do you like the intro?
980560	986000	After you freeze all the dragons, the book will fry. Maybe a dragon girl would be fun for them too.
987040	992800	Wouldn't that be adorable? Wouldn't she be just the cute little bunny?
993520	1004560	Anyway, I did not listen to what that was meant to. I think she's healing me when she does that.
1005200	1009520	Generally, three or four, the men you should tell you. Oh, if I press start.
1010240	1014880	Okay, okay, so there's two more dragons. We're gonna go this way then because we're not
1014960	1017760	going this way. I think I spawned here. Excuse me. Thank you.
1020400	1026080	Okay, stop. I actually love how simple this game is. I actually am enjoying it very much.
1027040	1032080	I'm so sorry if I don't fit something very enthusiastic today. I'm one tired baby.
1032080	1037680	I was hanging about at the airport for ages. My dad said his luggage just wasn't coming,
1038640	1045840	but I did it. What? I can't break titanium. Oh, come on.
1047920	1050560	Pardon me. How strong are my horns if I can do that?
1053760	1057760	These games in my childhood, two and three are so much better though. Oh no, I picked the worst one.
1058800	1066320	As your dad doing, he never slept for like 48 hours. He did not see a bed, so he's had better days.
1067280	1074320	No way. No way. I perfectly fucking had the gamer sense to know where the heck this dragon is.
1075920	1081200	You are a dragon and you're very strong. It's good to start here, but to his best.
1084000	1086480	The others just add a lot more elements to them.
1087440	1094320	What? Does he sound like the perfect old weeb? Oh, sure.
1096480	1101200	Okay, thank you for releasing this though. Right, so exit level and we get to keep everything?
1104880	1107920	I assume we get to keep everything. It's not like one of those games.
1108880	1113840	Returning to artisan.
1117760	1119360	Yes. Okay, it did let me keep it.
1122640	1126960	Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me. Come through. I just need a portal. That's all.
1127840	1132880	Let's stay. Oh, I'm scared to do any flight stuff though. It's like a flight mission,
1132880	1136400	so as I'll come back later, mate, I'm no interested right now. I'm too rubbish at it.
1138160	1144000	Was there a portal over here? You missed the gem. It didn't save the gem.
1146640	1151840	You need to collect gems if you want to do 100%? I've got a life for doing that.
1154000	1156160	The dark hollow. Ooh, the haunted.
1158880	1163200	But I have no idea how long we're going to play for actually. He should be waking up soon,
1163200	1167440	if I'm being honest. I'm trying to be quiet. I don't want to wake because he was like,
1167440	1170480	oh, you're not going to be that loud when you play games, are you? And I'm like,
1172240	1174320	you're joking, right? I'll be screaming down the mic.
1177920	1182800	But yes, when she becomes up, I think I'll redirect into her. I have no idea how long
1182800	1189440	this game takes to finish. They're attacking me. No, you're not supposed to actually attack me.
1189440	1198560	Right, we need three dragons. There's three frogs. Oh, wait, the frogs are healing up my dragonfly?
1199440	1205280	Oh, the dragonfly's eating the boos. Oh, wait.
1210160	1212960	Oh, sorry, I love the combat because it's so easy.
1213200	1218960	How many hits can I take in a really quick few?
1225600	1231440	Okay, oh, there's a dragon here. Darius. Four hits and I'm out.
1233840	1238880	I pray that your dad's a deep sleeper. Well, I don't know if we can do ASMR streams and I'm like,
1238960	1244640	oh my god, three weeks? No ASMR stream seems bizarre because literally it's my main focus.
1246080	1251680	I have entered the battle zone. Oh, yes, hell come here. Okay, feed drags. Okay, drags is back to being
1251680	1265520	focused. If we do end up doing no ASMR streams for three weeks, I pinky promise I will make
1265760	1271920	no, don't return home. I don't even got the other dragons yet. I pinky promise I will do like,
1271920	1275040	I'll shut you not like, back to back ASMR stream type stuff.
1278320	1286640	Neat glide from up here. You light the campfire.
1287600	1291440	Oh, we flings, we're camping.
1293440	1298880	Ew, that's so cute. I prefer when you play games though. Oh, I think,
1300000	1303760	I know everyone's got their, oh my god, I'm actually so smart for figuring that out.
1306320	1312480	Oh, life. The only time I can get a life is in video games, swing school.
1313440	1320400	Oh, I don't think I've been done this way. Nope. We'll do fine. We'll cry, but we'll do fine.
1320960	1323680	Oh, okay, again, right. So the big guy is fire.
1327200	1332480	Sorry, I'm trying to get used to this. Whoa, what? Can I only get his buff?
1335440	1340480	Oh no. Oh, I'm getting scared. Stop, stop. I'm actually scared. That scared me. Please don't do
1340480	1346880	that again. Put him away, yeah, man. Honestly, just a moment. I'm not doing it.
1353040	1355840	All right, you do it. He's smart too. I forgot that part. Stop.
1361840	1366320	Why does he have such a generic like spiral? Whoa, there's a key.
1367280	1369920	Okay, Reefling, it's time to lock up and give me,
1371520	1374880	I'm just the key dude. Must unlock his secret door.
1377840	1381360	I'm looking at the map. I don't know where my last dragon is.
1387760	1394800	He's like, hardly patrolling. Yeah. Does he even care?
1396800	1403280	Okay, geez. That was like so hard to grab him.
1406560	1415120	Aspire was a generic 90s teenager. Oh yeah, right. I'm on it. Like that's what I'm getting from him.
1416160	1421280	Can't flea mill, can't ram big. Grilled his butt. That was my only option. Oh, it's never going up.
1422240	1423920	He must be up there, head over here.
1425600	1426880	Hominah, hominah, hominah, hominah.
1429760	1430880	Oh, it has a key.
1434080	1439920	Oh, this is like such a polite little game. Okay, we can fire that one.
1441440	1447200	Okay, sorry, but this game is actually so fair. I love it. I just think I'm just going to be a
1447200	1452000	professional child's game like reviewer and stuff. It's because I suck at games.
1455360	1456880	Whoa, the Spiral Vs.
1462080	1463600	Taken over the mic? Well.
1468720	1474160	I like how the dragons are actually tutorials as well. That's so nice. I like it.
1474640	1482880	Okay, so if I, I'm not to leave, I'm to use the portal, which is over here.
1484800	1488400	Aspire's speedruns are quite the experience. Oh, we're in speedrunning.
1490320	1497040	I'm just going to try and collect as many dragons as I can before I go offline.
1497040	1499760	I'm going to have to definitely change up some of my schedule though.
1504320	1511040	Uh, I like how cute the game is. I don't know how easy it is to 100% with the gems or whatever.
1511920	1518080	Actually, it wouldn't be impossible. All right, we'll have with them. Right, I'm not
1518080	1521280	doing the fine mission because it sucks, so there must be another mission. You know,
1521280	1525360	something about this castle up here? Ah, the platform's here.
1527840	1531360	You're perfectly qualified for video game journalism then, and ironically,
1532320	1533680	what's this? Hello.
1536000	1540320	Knock, knock. I'm Spyro. Please let me in. Is that like the end of it?
1543440	1546800	Hmm, we did the haunted mansion. We did that one. I don't know what this one is.
1549280	1551200	Most of the gems are just hanging out in the world.
1551440	1561440	Oh. Resued Thomas. Congrats if your name's Thomas. I'll try and talk to you later, Thomas.
1575120	1578960	Oh, man. Yeah, of course. Thanks for the advice.
1579520	1582720	Stop. You're so generic. I love them.
1586080	1589280	Turn square. Oh yeah, we're going to civilization.
1591920	1601600	Hmm. Yeah, I was really sick. I had to go to a bakery at the airport. I paid $5.50 for a tiny
1601680	1611040	little lemonade bottle, and I had to get a sick bag off of her. I was like, I'm so sorry to ask,
1611600	1616880	but do you sell plastic bags at all? And she was like, I'm so sorry, I don't. And I was like,
1616880	1621440	do you, is it okay if I can buy a little paper bag off of you because I needed something to
1621440	1627600	be sick in in case I was sick on the way back? And she was like, oh no, it's fine. You can just
1627600	1632800	have it for free, darling. I think she could see I was like sick as fuck whilst I'm waiting for my
1632800	1640240	freaking dad. The same voice actor as SpongeBob. That's fantastic. Welcome to Town Square. None of
1640240	1650400	the dragons are re... None of the dragons are being reused. Like, they're all designed new. This is
1650400	1657520	so good. Okay, right. I assume I rammed them from behind. Oh no, I can burn them as well.
1660320	1666720	Uh, jump. I can't imagine paying for a bag like that. Well, in Scotland, you have to pay for any
1666720	1678560	bags you take away. Want me to ram it and jump? Okay. And like, I don't want to get in trouble or
1678560	1684960	anything for doing, like, for not thinking. So I was just like, oh, can I pay for these? She was
1684960	1692640	like, nah, just take it for free. You already got scum assed on the lemonade. Like, when you risk
1692640	1701360	you all doing empire. You do. So in Scotland, it's set up, you have to pay for like those takeaway bags
1701360	1706400	from any shop or whatever. And it's supposed to go to charity, but obviously it started it,
1706400	1710640	there were gonna be five pence, but then it's obviously changed to whatever the fuck they
1710640	1717280	want to charge because they make a profit on that, you know. I assume if I get a hundred gems.
1722560	1724000	Oh, I just made him perish.
1724640	1736800	The odd thing is that this is how the OG game looks in my memory. I'm always like that with
1736800	1741840	video games. Like, when I played Brotherhood, I was like, oh my god, this game's aged a little bit.
1741840	1747280	Like, just go to the graphics and stuff. And I was like, wait, I don't remember like Brotherhood
1747280	1753680	being the most top notch thing I've ever seen in my life. You're using your gamer
1753760	1755040	instincts. I mean, it's winning.
1761040	1765920	The egg. Uh, that would be me. If I was a dragon, I'm like, oh, I'm winded me.
1766720	1772000	I think there is a guy back here, but I don't know how to get there. No, I don't want to jump
1772000	1784160	back down. Well, it's more than 10 years old now at the time. It was so good.
1786800	1793520	So red. Hold on. I'm really struggling with the camera angle from being honest. I don't know.
1793520	1797440	I don't know if it's janky for you guys, but I had to get up there.
1798400	1804160	I don't claim on the phone. What? I don't claim on the phone.
1811200	1816640	Huh. Hold on. Let's just have the camera's wear back in the day.
1816960	1830640	Can I jump up in the very far now? No. Hmm. My gamer senses. Oh, no. What?
1832720	1837760	The game wouldn't force you to restart a mission if you're not complete it. How many
1837760	1839200	have I got? Yeah, I'm missing a dragon.
1845840	1847360	You had the right idea of gliding.
1851520	1854000	I didn't see platform that I'm supposed to go on though.
1858560	1861520	When you hear an an an an an, it means there's an egg thief nearby.
1862400	1869760	Sorry. Glide from the top of the stairs to the egg thief.
1871760	1876640	This can't be. No. Oh, wait. Maybe it was. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute,
1876640	1879760	Riefling. So you actually are so right. Hold on.
1882880	1885840	Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just need to give it a really hard turn.
1886480	1891760	I don't know how you're supposed to figure this stuff out on your own child's game,
1891760	1898400	by the way. Oh, we did it. Glade to the secret egg thief in the town square. Okay, I can do that.
1900000	1909920	Where is he? He can jump. I'm gonna make him jump. Did it make me jump down?
1910240	1911920	It did. I need to go all the way back.
1915440	1917920	Yeah, I definitely can't reach that. Okay.
1919840	1926400	As if I missed it. How embarrassing. Anyone remember the live-action commercials of the
1926400	1932880	creepy sheep protesting this game? Someone protested Spyro before.
1932960	1939600	Backseat successful. Yes, you're more than welcome to backseat me. I have absolutely
1939600	1943680	no issues with it. I am but a humble crybaby colfish.
1946240	1949920	I don't know what I'm doing and I'm more than happy to be told what to do.
1951440	1953680	And no, do not add like a good girl at the end of that.
1954080	1958000	Okay, we did it.
1962320	1964640	It's quick, so that's fine. You're the clunk, clunk, clunk.
1968320	1968800	Sorry.
1976800	1978560	The back door is back on the main.
1978560	1985120	This Skyrim commercials had the cheap protests and oh the sheep
1985120	1988400	protests in the game because you hurt the sheep to get your HP back.
1990800	1995680	I haven't developed the urge to click gems on site. I don't know. You guys said it's easy,
1995680	2000560	but I don't trust myself that it's actually easy. Yet.
2004720	2008480	I'm not looking forward to this flight mission, but I think it's the only one we've not done yet.
2008880	2013120	Wait, is the game seriously over after the flight mission? Can I be?
2017520	2018160	Can I be?
2024080	2026160	All right, I think it is the flight mission time.
2028800	2031760	No, it's not over. The hot air balloon takes you to a new world.
2032720	2037680	I hope you hurt my destiny.
2037680	2039600	Right, we'll give this place a shot again.
2039600	2042160	If we don't get anywhere, we'll go speak to the hot, I'm sorry,
2042160	2043760	we'll go speak to the hot balloon guy.
2044960	2047280	I'm sorry, little sprax.
2048080	2052720	There are five flight missions, one in the world. I've got another five worlds.
2055600	2059520	The only legitimate challenger in the first fire games are the flight missions.
2059520	2061840	The bosses aren't even responsible.
2065200	2066400	There are, right.
2069040	2072720	Oh, I did. Oh, okay. You didn't see that. You honestly didn't see that.
2072720	2074160	How about we just go to the next world?
2074160	2076800	Yeah, I agree. We should just go to the next world.
2076800	2080160	A freaking priced X thinking it was going to flamethrower.
2080160	2081040	I'm so sorry.
2082160	2084480	I was so freaking sorry. That was so bad.
2084480	2086320	I'm actually so embarrassed. I don't want to do that.
2086960	2089840	Do you hear me? Do you spank me with a heel?
2089840	2091360	No, you don't. I don't know what you do.
2091360	2093040	Right, no one saw that.
2093040	2094800	We're just going to move on to the next world
2094800	2097760	and because we've totally done all the missions in this one.
2098320	2099840	I missed our hot air balloon guy.
2099840	2103520	Hello. Wow, I see you.
2103520	2107120	I see you've been busy rescuing dragon Spyro.
2107120	2108000	Yes.
2108000	2111440	You may travel to the peacekeepers world if you like.
2111440	2112880	Are you ready to go?
2112880	2113600	Yeah, let's go.
2116720	2118240	The fairies just to check point.
2118240	2118800	Flight mission.
2118800	2122080	What flight mission literally starts the flight mission
2122080	2123200	instantly goes on the water?
2123200	2124080	Yeah, all right then.
2124080	2125840	Okay, talk about MLG Pro.
2127280	2128960	The flight missions are optional.
2128960	2130560	Oh, the developers.
2130560	2137280	I could spiral developer team.
2137280	2139360	Thank you for letting me skip the flight mission.
2140720	2142800	I didn't see a dragon.
2142800	2144240	Okay, let's see this new area.
2146640	2148960	What? Hello.
2149920	2150800	I hear an enemy.
2152400	2152880	Titan.
2154560	2155680	Those devs owe me.
2157120	2158720	Wow, what an interesting color scheme.
2167120	2169120	Wait, I guess because they're dragons,
2169120	2172640	they won their money.
2172640	2175760	Oh, here he is.
2176640	2177760	Here's cannon.
2177760	2179280	I'm just a wee dragon.
2179280	2181040	Why are you cannonballing me?
2181040	2182320	Why are you shooting me?
2183120	2184960	That's really, I'm just a wee dragon.
2184960	2186080	Right, dry canyon.
2187360	2188800	Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it.
2192240	2194320	Can't wait to see your reaction to a boss.
2194320	2195200	You will laugh.
2195360	2203360	You gotta do some yard work.
2203360	2205520	Oh, you can move in the little wooden thing.
2207440	2209600	You skip the boss level for the art level.
2210240	2211680	Is that what was behind the door?
2212400	2213680	How did I get through the door?
2216400	2219040	You didn't say it, but I thought it though.
2219040	2222080	Oh, funny.
2222080	2222720	I'm sorry.
2222720	2224480	And Kana needs you to eat that.
2227200	2228880	Oh, I didn't mean to do that to the other one.
2230240	2233120	That's this knock knock.
2233120	2233600	Okay.
2240480	2243680	Oh, can I just go?
2243680	2245840	I'm just going to send it by the pope.
2246400	2249600	I just checked the price for the triology too expensive.
2249600	2251600	I'd rather just spend money on one.
2253200	2255040	You know you're allowed to treat yourself right.
2255040	2256800	Thank you so much, bully legend.
2259760	2260720	Oh, I missed.
2260720	2261200	Sorry.
2263920	2265920	Can I go the opposite way that he goes?
2265920	2266880	Oh, well, I got him.
2266880	2268720	I was going to say, can I go the opposite way he goes?
2268720	2269680	So I can't interact him.
2271360	2274640	What do you do other than get in my way?
2274640	2275520	Oh, he's going to shoot him.
2281120	2282160	Rescued coin.
2283280	2285600	Thank you again for the super chat, bully legend.
2286240	2288080	It's 12 bucks on steam.
2288080	2289760	You can, but he'll turn.
2289760	2290880	He'll run the other way.
2291920	2293280	I cannot believe.
2294160	2295200	Oh, that was water.
2295200	2295520	Sorry.
2295520	2296320	I never even saw that.
2296320	2297680	I was too busy focused on the guy.
2300160	2302080	I got an achievement for charging a vulture.
2302800	2304320	Sorry, you can't ram big guys.
2305360	2306240	But I can try.
2307120	2307840	Come here, everyone.
2311600	2313120	How many dragons are on this level?
2313120	2315040	There are four dragons on the, oh,
2315040	2317360	there are two more dragons to collect on this level.
2319040	2320320	It says it's 40 bucks for me.
2327280	2327840	Yeah, yeah.
2331520	2333200	Oh my god, I love the dialogue.
2333200	2334960	I was born to glide.
2336560	2338160	I love you, Spyro.
2339360	2340400	This game is so cute.
2343440	2344720	No, no, no, don't shoot.
2344720	2345360	Oh, sorry.
2345360	2345920	Wait, hold on.
2346480	2346800	Yay.
2348880	2349840	Oh, sorry.
2349840	2352160	I keep forgetting and then jumping.
2352160	2354960	Ah, oh, don't glade.
2355520	2356240	Glade where?
2358880	2360640	That wasn't rewarded for glading.
2360640	2361120	Oh.
2363600	2364160	My neck.
2365280	2366480	Oh, thank you for the read.
2367200	2367840	Kylie won.
2368960	2370400	I'm praying I'm sorry.
2370400	2371040	Thank you for the read.
2371040	2371760	I appreciate that.
2371760	2372160	Hi.
2373200	2374400	By the Pope, who was there?
2375280	2376800	I'm playing Spyro.
2376800	2378480	It's not my childhood game.
2378480	2379840	It's your childhood game.
2379840	2380880	And I don't know what I'm doing.
2380880	2383120	So I'm so sorry for the gameplay if it's frustrating.
2383120	2384000	But hi, readers.
2384560	2390400	I'm Strony Quotles from Motherfucking Vela, Gen 1.
2390960	2391520	Indulge.
2392320	2392640	Get it?
2392640	2395200	It's a big pun because you're supposed to indulge in us.
2397600	2399520	Who came up with this stuff?
2399520	2400560	Honestly, it was me.
2400560	2401120	I named it.
2401120	2401600	I'm sorry.
2401600	2404000	I'm sorry to any of the girls that don't like her name.
2408160	2408640	Oh, please.
2413120	2414240	That can give me a few hints.
2414880	2416000	Oh, I just got wallet.
2416000	2416800	Sorry.
2416800	2418160	I really need to heal, I think.
2418160	2420800	I think next practice is about to smack me.
2422080	2423360	Wait, he's not even with me?
2423360	2425680	I've lost my wee dragonfly.
2427040	2427360	Um...
2431200	2431680	Oh?
2432480	2433280	Hi.
2433280	2433680	Ivory.
2435360	2435680	Yeah.
2436800	2437600	I'm the baby.
2439760	2441200	Oh my god, that's so cute.
2441200	2443920	A wee puff of smoke when hitting our die.
2445760	2448320	Then you go back to the start where the rabbits are.
2449280	2451040	I didn't see any heals.
2453920	2454720	All right, I don't want...
2456240	2456880	Oh, I'm scared.
2456880	2458240	Sorry, I can't see where that guy is.
2458800	2459440	Behind me.
2460960	2462240	Is there any dragon that way?
2463760	2464080	No.
2465600	2467440	I don't see any bunnies either.
2473680	2475360	I'll let them think they're going to win, okay?
2475360	2479360	There's a one behind the castle, though.
2479360	2479760	Oh, there is.
2482160	2483600	He hid over that person.
2484800	2486160	He came up with that as a junior.
2490720	2491920	I didn't see a bun bun.
2493280	2494960	There's no sheebie in sight to eat.
2496480	2497600	I was going to throw that at him.
2498960	2499440	I...
2499440	2500240	Can I glide to...
2500240	2501920	Oh, I definitely can glide to here.
2501920	2502560	What are you?
2502560	2503120	Fireworks?
2505600	2507120	Oh my god, it's the 4th of July.
2509440	2512160	Again, sorry to everyone that lost a finger on the 4th of July.
2514800	2516480	We apologize greatly for your...
2518720	2519280	You lost.
2523360	2524960	I got yanked out of nowhere.
2524960	2526000	That was so rude.
2526960	2527680	So what happens?
2530080	2532240	Oh, I just respawned the real last left.
2532240	2533760	Oh, but respawned all the enemies.
2533760	2534800	They're limited enemies.
2535360	2537360	Oh, the vulture just not cared about me.
2538400	2539360	Sorry about that.
2540480	2541520	Okay, let's try that again.
2543120	2544400	Looks like I can glide over there.
2546320	2548240	It was like a souls-like ambush
2548240	2550960	when Anno literally when the guy's just waiting for you behind the door
2550960	2551600	and you're like, uh...
2559760	2562800	Oh, I literally forgot our 4th.
2563040	2564480	Oh, right.
2564480	2565600	You stop it.
2565600	2566560	You're upsetting me.
2566560	2567280	Give me that heal.
2568880	2569600	That's this way.
2575200	2576480	Oh, he doesn't.
2576480	2577840	I actually seem to kill him.
2577840	2578400	Oh, well.
2582000	2583440	Wait, I've already had the dragon here.
2584160	2585520	I just have to go backwards?
2589600	2591040	I can hear something all over.
2593520	2595600	Do not go back to that portal.
2595600	2596400	They must be...
2596400	2597440	Oh, there's my dragon here.
2599280	2600080	Oh, I see.
2601280	2602080	See him?
2602080	2602960	How'd I get to you?
2604560	2605440	Glide over there.
2605440	2606560	How'd I glide over there?
2608720	2610240	I'm investigating.
2610240	2611440	I'm thinking.
2611440	2613680	I'm using the environmental cues.
2614320	2614560	Oh.
2616160	2617280	Oh, bunny's here.
2618720	2620160	I'm gonna replay the games now.
2620160	2621600	They're so good.
2621600	2622320	Oh, god.
2622960	2627200	I just suck at them so badly.
2628240	2630800	If you press Y, we'll gain gliding.
2630800	2631600	You gain height.
2633520	2634880	That cuts my thing short.
2637200	2638480	Are you pranking me, Riefling?
2638480	2639120	Be honest.
2643680	2644800	Wait, I just hit a circle.
2644800	2645360	I'm sorry.
2645360	2645840	I'm sorry.
2646640	2648880	I'm getting a bit confuzzled in these games, right?
2648880	2651520	I'm supposed to glade to get to the next wagon.
2651600	2652880	Which I got 100% to.
2652880	2653360	Right.
2653360	2654320	There's water here.
2656400	2657520	If I jump, jump, jump.
2658720	2660720	I've already been to the left, right?
2665280	2667040	I already gladed to there.
2669680	2670720	That ain't water.
2670720	2671040	Oil?
2675360	2675920	Right.
2675920	2676800	Okay, hold on.
2677200	2680160	I guess I'll go back and take a right again.
2680160	2681200	How many am I missing?
2681200	2682160	Oh, just the one.
2683040	2684720	Which was like back there.
2688320	2691440	I'm getting spoiled rotten by the algorithm at the moment.
2691440	2692160	I'm not even kidding.
2692160	2695440	And Emmy fantastically got 10,000 subscribers.
2695440	2697120	I'm so freaking proud of her.
2697120	2698720	Wait, have I been here before?
2700720	2702480	I mean, I've been here before.
2702480	2704000	I mean, I've been here before.
2704960	2707200	I mean, no, I have been here before.
2707200	2708240	I just don't remember.
2709040	2710720	I'll see if there's something over here.
2714720	2716720	I don't want to get booted off the map
2717280	2718720	because I'm ramming him,
2718720	2721120	but he's like so at the edge.
2722240	2722720	Right.
2722720	2724000	There was nothing even special here.
2726000	2726560	I love her.
2726560	2727360	She says dragon.
2727360	2728560	She says it like the wagon.
2728560	2729360	Dragon.
2730560	2732800	Oh, does it actually sound like I'm saying wagon?
2732800	2741920	Does it actually sound like I'm saying wagon to you instead of dragon?
2744960	2747920	If I start streaming, what do you recommend?
2753280	2755040	I mean, I like YouTube,
2756240	2759040	but I like YouTube because the rules aren't there.
2759680	2762960	Well, other than the recent ASMR fiasco,
2762960	2765200	their rules are normally pretty cut and dry
2765200	2767280	and it's pretty obvious what you can or can't get rid of.
2768720	2770000	I don't need jewels.
2770000	2772160	I need this wagon to the right.
2775920	2776880	That's over here.
2778000	2779600	Okay, it must be the Castello,
2779600	2780560	but how did I get up?
2785680	2787600	Whoa, I just make it look like this.
2788480	2789760	It has to be.
2789760	2790720	I don't see any.
2795120	2795680	Fuck.
2795680	2796320	Oh, no.
2796960	2798640	I have to go all the way around again
2800240	2801280	to try and make,
2801280	2803200	to try and be allowed to make that jump.
2803920	2805200	God, it sucks so bad.
2806480	2807440	You aren't far behind.
2807440	2808640	I'm proud of the V-Sucking.
2809920	2811920	No, I don't want to be first.
2813600	2816080	Okay, I need to just do a circle around here.
2816080	2816880	I'm too short.
2816880	2818400	Don't make fun of me.
2818400	2820400	No, I want the girls to be ahead of me.
2821280	2823120	I don't want to be like in the lead,
2823120	2824720	so I'm glad that Emmy took over.
2827040	2829120	I really hope Shibi can take over as well.
2829120	2829920	I think she can.
2832240	2833360	Hey, right.
2833360	2834080	What the heck?
2834960	2836000	Did I just send it?
2837520	2837920	Oh, shit.
2838560	2840320	Spyro, can you aim a bit better, please?
2840320	2840880	Thank you.
2840880	2841280	Right.
2841280	2841680	Jump.
2841680	2842400	Hold.
2844160	2844480	What?
2846880	2848080	I'm sure I can do it.
2848080	2849120	It's like so close.
2852160	2854320	And the VOD system is a man.
2854320	2856960	I also find that Twitch is only a good user experience.
2858160	2858960	Twitch mobile.
2858960	2860640	Are you squinting me right now?
2862160	2864720	Have you seen how to train your wagon?
2864720	2867680	What about the childhood shirt wagon tails?
2867680	2870560	Sorry, I think the way you say dragon is cute.
2870560	2872560	I'm saying dragon with an R.
2872560	2873280	Dragon.
2873840	2874960	Dragon.
2874960	2876000	It's not wagon.
2877760	2878720	Thank you for the five.
2880000	2881120	Veal or lover.
2881120	2885440	But oh, oh, for Spyro, buddy.
2885440	2886160	What was that?
2887200	2889280	You didn't even try to double jump.
2889280	2890880	I thought you could like double jump glades.
2892160	2895760	Ah, we're going to be here for a long time
2895760	2897200	if I can't even make this damn jump.
2898400	2899840	Then you aren't focusing.
2899840	2901120	You see the wagon.
2901120	2901920	Dragon.
2902720	2905360	Dragon.
2907440	2910160	My nuts on your face.
2912160	2912880	Double jump.
2912880	2914000	I'm trying.
2917440	2919680	I'm freaking missing it by a bore here.
2921600	2924480	Lord of Storms, thank you for the five gifted memberships.
2924480	2926480	Congrats to those who caught it with their face.
2929440	2932640	I think you do have to enable it if you're just bing chining.
2933200	2937200	If you're a lurker, I think the chat prompts you to enable it.
2937200	2939040	I'm so sorry this is taken.
2939040	2941040	I'm sure this is like a super easy jump
2941040	2943600	and it's just hard for me because I'm really low IQ.
2944880	2945680	All right, hold on.
2948240	2950160	Please, Spyro, please.
2950160	2952080	Does he actually get a boost if I press Y?
2952080	2952800	Because I will do it.
2955200	2955840	I will do it.
2955840	2959120	I need something to glide off to practice this Y boost.
2959280	2963920	Just learning curves exist for a reason.
2963920	2967360	What do you mean I can't be MLG pro in a child's game in two seconds flat?
2967360	2970320	Right, if I do, and then Y.
2970320	2972720	No, Y doesn't give me a freaking sec.
2976720	2977520	Path for the Storm.
2977520	2978400	I'm just trying to sleep.
2978400	2981040	There's no, don't contain the Scottish rage.
2981040	2984960	Honestly, I'm like, bro, I mean, we can always quit and go to the next mission.
2985520	2987280	All right, I'll give it one more shot.
2987360	2989440	This rest on my entire.
2991200	2991520	Okay.
2994240	2995600	And then right on the edge.
2996400	2997200	Come on.
2999200	3002000	I'm not going crazy or is that really hard for no reason?
3003760	3004960	All right, give me one more chance.
3004960	3005600	One more chance.
3005600	3006160	One more chance.
3008560	3011360	Just give me one more chance.
3012080	3018960	Oh, maybe you just can't do it that way.
3018960	3022560	Someone said just you're not supposed to jump from there.
3025920	3027040	There's nowhere else to be.
3030320	3032480	I can't get up on these wee things here.
3033760	3035440	Turn around and fly in whole.
3036320	3040880	Fly in whole.
3045040	3046000	That wooden door.
3051920	3054560	It's really hard, but you have to keep trying on the edge.
3055600	3059280	Stop at the stairs, turn around, then fly into a hole.
3060240	3064400	But hole.
3068880	3070400	But you're supposed to be the smart one.
3071200	3074480	I only have three brain cells and they're fighting for fourth place.
3076480	3077280	Try finger.
3079520	3083120	I do remember never beating this game because I was too frustrated and I did beat two and three.
3083920	3085760	Stone stairs of it back.
3085760	3086080	Okay.
3087600	3088880	Oh, you fucking twat.
3088880	3091920	Right, stone stairs and then fly into butthole.
3093120	3096240	Stone stairs and fly into butthole.
3103120	3105360	Is it from that ledge I'm supposed to do it?
3113600	3114320	Is it that?
3114320	3115840	Is it honestly that one?
3119440	3127200	Oh, I'm not losing it.
3127200	3129760	I'm actually losing it and I fucking get skin corn.
3132640	3134960	Oh my god, that's so evil from the dead team.
3134960	3135360	So is.
3139200	3139840	Oh, right.
3139840	3140160	Okay.
3140160	3140480	Okay.
3141120	3143360	And then I just take a really short left.
3144560	3145680	Oh, for goodness sake.
3147520	3147920	Offer.
3149360	3152080	Bro, why did you guys let me do that for so long?
3153440	3154880	I'm embarrassing myself here.
3156240	3157840	That literally took a millisecond.
3164880	3166400	You let me struggle for how long?
3167520	3168000	Pass it.
3168000	3168560	Bend over.
3168560	3169600	You're all getting spanked.
3169600	3171520	You let me struggle for who?
3174160	3176080	We'll grab the key but we aren't really gonna.
3179040	3180160	Golf clap.
3180160	3180800	Good job.
3180800	3182080	Right, we got four dragons.
3183280	3186160	I don't know that was the solution but at your third try,
3186160	3189520	the lesson is that maybe that's not a solution yet.
3189520	3190960	I think I'll go with that as well.
3190960	3192800	But it looked like I was so close.
3192800	3195040	I mean, they probably did that for a reason.
3198080	3198720	Uh, right.
3199520	3201040	We're just looking for a portal.
3202080	3203280	Oh, they're scared of me.
3203280	3204560	Yeah, you should be actually.
3204560	3205600	Right, that's where I came in.
3206320	3207600	Oh, I never even unlocked you.
3207600	3208000	Sorry.
3209280	3210160	Hi, Magnus.
3216720	3219120	Yeah, please burn the tents.
3219120	3220880	Oh, we're pillaging now?
3220880	3221440	Oh dear.
3222560	3225040	Thanks again, Lord of Storms for the gifted memberships.
3225040	3226160	I appreciate it.
3226160	3227440	And then I get to see my moats.
3228000	3232880	I'm waiting for the next moat update as I just coughed there.
3233840	3235840	I should be coming in soon.
3235840	3238160	I think up next is Mercy the Moats.
3239760	3240560	Or is it Sheebie?
3241440	3246560	It's either Sheebie, Mercy, Azura, or Mercy, Sheebie, Azura, and then me last.
3247200	3249840	But that's because we can be patient for a moat.
3249840	3251440	I want the girls to have theirs first.
3252400	3253680	This isn't Elden Ring.
3253680	3257760	You probably can't just bash your head into a wall over and get into a works.
3257760	3260160	Well, that's why I normally spawn you guys in at that point.
3261360	3263040	Although I've been cheating from the start.
3263040	3267280	Like, I know I was supposed to use a, like, explore the DLC on my own,
3267280	3269760	but I just like playing games with you.
3269760	3271600	Like, I like when you hold my hand through stuff.
3271600	3274080	Like, I had so much fun playing the Jellybean game.
3274080	3274960	I was so excited.
3274960	3275760	I was like, listen...
3275760	3276560	Oh, sorry.
3278400	3282720	I like listen to some of the thing and you can hear the excitement in my voice
3282720	3285760	because my voice was, like, so light-pitched the entire stream
3285760	3287280	because I was just so happy playing.
3287840	3289840	So with you, I was like, oh, I don't really...
3289840	3292080	I was, like, up here, like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
3292080	3293200	Instead of, like, my...
3293200	3295520	Usually, like, down here, generic talking.
3296240	3296720	Um...
3298640	3300240	Oh, I got snowball fight going on.
3302240	3303200	Okay, first dragon.
3303200	3303840	Oh!
3303840	3305120	There is a bat.
3305120	3306560	I think it just took my health.
3310880	3314080	I like how Micev indulges thanks to the same creatives
3314080	3315200	being commissioned first.
3315200	3316080	Mmm.
3316080	3318560	Well, the ACs are most actually a little bit different
3318560	3320240	than what we commissioned the first time.
3320240	3321920	But she was just super happy to get them.
3321920	3323360	And I was like, well, she's not complaining.
3323360	3324480	It means less work for me.
3324720	3327600	So I'll just accept them, which is terrible,
3327600	3330080	but, oh, I have to admit, I'm a bit tired
3330880	3335200	of doing, like, in the background work.
3335920	3336880	I think it's terrible.
3336880	3339440	Like, I love what I do, and I'm so lucky that I get to do it.
3339440	3344000	But, oh, I can't wait for, like, all the most order type things.
3344000	3348000	Thank you, CRC Error, for the membership.
3348640	3353120	It's really cute.
3353120	3354000	And...
3356400	3357360	Kendra?
3357360	3358480	The very VTuber?
3360000	3360560	Hello!
3360560	3362320	Thank you for redirecting into me.
3363200	3364320	We're just playing Spyro,
3364320	3366560	which is a childhood game of everyone,
3366560	3368240	but me, I've never played it before.
3368800	3370080	And I'm struggling a little bit,
3370080	3371280	and it's a bit cringe,
3371280	3373200	but it's still a kid's game,
3373200	3374960	so there's hope that I can complete it.
3375680	3376960	Um, hello!
3379120	3380800	I am Strony Culls from
3382320	3384480	Availers, Gen 1, and Dolls.
3386960	3390480	And that's pretty much it.
3390480	3391760	I'm wildly inappropriate,
3391760	3393040	so if you don't like that, please,
3393040	3394640	do not ever feel forced to watch me.
3397360	3399600	We're just playing Spy...
3399600	3400720	This is a dead end?
3400720	3401280	Oh, no.
3402160	3404560	Um, we're just collecting all the dragons.
3404560	3405840	We're not doing all the gems,
3405840	3407760	but this is Spyro 1 Remake.
3408480	3408800	Um...
3410320	3412320	We're just getting all our new dragons
3412320	3413280	and doing it right now.
3414880	3415200	What?
3416720	3418160	Thank you for releasing me!
3418720	3419120	Hello!
3420240	3422080	Okay, no more tutorial information.
3422080	3423280	That's interesting.
3427760	3429440	But yeah, we unlocked the little dragons
3429440	3431280	by touching the green statue.
3431280	3432000	Huge.
3432720	3435280	You've got the camera angle on that.
3435280	3436640	I'm struggling a wee bit,
3436640	3437680	but that angle stopped me.
3443840	3444720	No, it didn't.
3455040	3456400	Am I doing it justice?
3456400	3456960	I'm glad.
3456960	3458720	I feel like I'm so low energy today,
3458720	3460880	but I was very ill yesterday.
3460880	3461600	Oh my god.
3462960	3465920	That taxi driver was trying to take me out.
3465920	3466880	I swear he's like,
3466880	3468320	now I'm gonna fuck you up.
3468320	3470080	Thank you so much for the tip, Anonymous.
3470080	3471360	I'm glad you're enjoying it.
3471360	3473040	I feel a bit, um...
3475040	3477040	Insecure's a bit of a dramatic word,
3477040	3478320	like fucking relax.
3478320	3479600	But like, I feel a bit like,
3479600	3481440	oh no, I'm not really doing that well.
3482320	3482640	Um...
3485760	3487280	This game is perfect for a chill stream.
3487280	3487840	You're doing great.
3487840	3488800	I'm loving the dance.
3488800	3489760	Oh, thank you.
3490720	3492320	You're in a little ego boost, right?
3492320	3493360	I don't know where they're at.
3493360	3493840	Thank you.
3495840	3498320	Oh, how much they went right past the...
3498320	3498880	Is it there?
3499680	3501920	Or is it just saying that there's a shining gem there?
3503440	3505040	Okay, I think we're gonna have to backtrack
3505040	3506960	to try and find this other dragon.
3508720	3511520	And yes, I'm seeing dragon on purpose like that now,
3511520	3512800	because you guys are a billion, though.
3514480	3515120	Oh, it's okay.
3515120	3516320	You're probably doing better than me.
3516640	3520640	Uh...
3524000	3525280	The music's cute,
3526720	3530640	but not cute enough for Gen 2's background music
3530640	3532240	to be themed off of all.
3532240	3534800	I'm gonna see if I can be cheeky and get,
3536480	3536800	maybe,
3538480	3539280	Minish Cap.
3540320	3541600	I do like Minish Cap.
3541600	3542480	I really do.
3542480	3544080	Right, that's a ledge to jump over
3544080	3545120	if I've ever seen one.
3545120	3546240	Can I climb up somewhere?
3547840	3548560	I can.
3548560	3551200	Okay, I think it must be this ledge then.
3555600	3556720	Yeah, come on.
3557840	3558880	Nope, it's not.
3558880	3560080	All right, we're downflyed too.
3560080	3561760	Come on, give it to me straight.
3565280	3566960	Ah, I don't have the key for that.
3568160	3571840	Crash Bandicoot, twin sanity background music.
3572480	3576720	Yeah, I remember you beating the final boss like a real pro.
3579040	3579360	What?
3582560	3583360	Conk, conk, conk.
3587120	3589200	I'm searching, I'm looking.
3592240	3592560	What?
3594800	3595280	I don't...
3596640	3597360	Go away, please.
3597360	3602000	Is he gonna get me?
3602000	3602240	No.
3603520	3604000	I was like,
3604000	3606480	is the height difference about to enroll me?
3606480	3608160	Wait, I'm all the way back at the start.
3609680	3610000	Huh?
3613520	3614800	Where's this flipping dragon?
3614800	3615840	I never noticed that.
3615840	3616640	Is it like hiding?
3618960	3620960	Last dragon is hella hard to find.
3624560	3627040	Clearly, I've freaking gone past the dum-dum.
3627120	3628800	Is he like under a hidden thing?
3628800	3631280	Like, you gotta do a U-turn to get to it and fly down.
3632000	3633040	Mr. Bat, please.
3634160	3636000	Okay, he's gonna heal up Spark.
3636960	3637760	Is he here?
3639280	3640400	Oh, this is a bedding.
3641520	3643600	You have a mini map on the lower left screen.
3646880	3650160	Oh, I forgot about that.
3651200	3653280	Oh, you mean that big thing that really helps out
3653280	3655520	to tell you where like hidden locations and stuff is?
3656480	3658080	Okay, it looks like...
3658080	3658560	I...
3658560	3659760	Whoa, don't do that.
3659760	3660560	That was a very nice...
3662400	3663600	Okay, it looks...
3663600	3667200	This is just a platform for the sake of being a platform.
3669680	3671920	Oh, my sister go down there to get the denki.
3678160	3679600	So then what was the bed on that?
3682800	3683600	Something over here?
3686160	3687760	Wait, where did we dot something on?
3689760	3690800	Hmm, okay.
3693760	3695440	So there's like a weird U-turn in here?
3696400	3697760	Wow, that's so tall.
3698960	3700240	And I'm so tiny.

4311720	4314720	Keep up the good work, and I know you'll fulfill your oh
4322280	4326000	Hey strongy think you could teach us some Scottish Gaelic
4326000	4328680	I have a goal of learning new languages
4328680	4336400	I am so sorry, but I come from the mainland of Scotland, and I was not taught gaelic at all
4337000	4338640	aim
4338640	4344480	So I'm sorry to disappoint gaelic lover, but actually I can't teach it because I was never taught it myself
4344880	4347640	The only words I know are polis
4348480	4350480	aim
4352600	4354600	Oh
4354960	4360720	Police is polis and Scotland is Alba. Those are the only words. I know okay. How'd I get over here?
4360720	4364400	I still keep the dragon, right? Okay, if I keep the dragon. Oh, no, don't
4366920	4368920	What I need the balloon I
4371800	4373800	Can't believe I did that honestly
4374360	4379640	Only I would manage that. Okay, we're doing it. No, we're not we're not doing the night flight. We ain't doing any flights
4379640	4381240	Oh, sorry
4381360	4383960	That's where the whole other is the hot air balloon guy
4386680	4391280	Okay, take this I can't believe how fast you found so much stolen
4393280	4398960	Yeah, magic crafters I'm surprised you don't know any ranchy words in
4400760	4403160	Gaelic or Gaelic lover and
4404320	4409960	No one spoke it I come from the mainland of Scotland and now if you come from the islands up north or way up north
4409960	4414480	You're most likely to be taught it. So you're just talking an accent
4416440	4418680	Like a regional accent I and
4419600	4426800	Slang but like Scott slang but not Gaelic not Scott's Gaelic and I was never taught that they
4427400	4430480	So folk are actually wanting to be taught it so it doesn't
4433800	4438280	Juice I can't even see I'm around these damn corners. Oh, I can't jump
4440800	4442800	I'll
4444480	4446480	You
4447160	4452200	It's pronounced Alba and Gaelic Alba spell ELB
4453040	4455040	Oh, I love us. I

4469400	4471400	Got walled
4474880	4476880	Wow, wow, wow, wow
4479400	4485320	Oh, it's with Shadow Wizard money games we love casting spells at the Alpine Ridge
4486720	4488720	You need to chase him in the other direction
4496240	4502040	And you teach Sunday in Scots so that we can flirt with the nice lassie on vacation
4503240	4507080	There's really not any nice Scottish slang that I can think of
4507880	4508880	and
4508880	4514000	If she's pregnant you see oh, she's up the Duff which is just
4515200	4517760	It's not that pleasant of a terminology
4517760	4522840	I guess technically if you want to ask a Scottish chick, do you want to be pregnant by me?
4522840	4524840	You'd be like odd you want to be up the Duff?

4639720	4641720	Dragon crazy
4645920	4650520	Yeah, I didn't know what the game wanted me for there
4652520	4657440	Maybe someone doesn't want to get go. Oh my bad. I was thinking about the Chuff not Duff
4658720	4660720	Huh
4662680	4664680	Come on
4667760	4670400	That's such a distance though

4676560	4678560	Oh
4683160	4685160	Can't yell

4698080	4702360	Thank you again Raven and it's it and ask me to get out the
4703360	4709720	There will be no birthing of the lot the only thing on birth in his gen 2 maybe gen 3
4711080	4715520	And then that's that's all the birthing. Oh, this is any more. I'm supposed to go
4716480	4722160	I'm not supposed to over there. I'm stuck over here now. Can he be?
4727480	4731000	A Spyro up the Duff. Spyro is not pregnant. He just has a little belly
4732880	4734880	Oh
4736480	4741520	This Leo is really confusing me. I'm confuzzled
4744760	4751840	Looks like I'm supposed to do something to open that platform type thing, but I've not done it so I keep perishing
4757560	4759560	I'm like on my own over here
4760440	4765120	Is there like a secret? Does this game have secret walls?
4769800	4771800	You should pass the lead
4774800	4780440	There also may be a way to catch the egg guy that escaped earlier as a person that has 100% at this game
4780440	4784720	multiple times both in childhood and after the remake watching this has given me a small panic attack
4784720	4786720	Why am I doing everything the wrong way?
4787640	4791800	The Geomancers are supposed to open it, but I don't recall where he is
4792520	4795920	So I've basically progressed on the side of the map. I'm not supposed to I
4799000	4804320	Like when Scots type funny and complain about things on to our baby coughing on our bus right as I needed to
4804680	4809360	Cough so I nearly exploded hold on in because I didn't want to look like someone who copies babies
4809360	4814840	Oh my god, my favorite one is I want to wrap myself up in tin foil and blow myself up to fuck
4817640	4821240	Okay, yeah, something's supposed to open this
4822320	4827960	Is it that twat back there? There might be hold on let me perish need reset
4829640	4834920	Honestly, if you type it in it's like want to wrap myself up in tin foil and blow myself up to fucking the microwave
4834920	4837360	It's the funniest thing. I'm fucking red. I love it so much
4837800	4842720	That's why I sometimes go like, oh, I want to blow myself up, but it's because of that tin foil tweet
4842720	4849720	Is it that? Is that why that ledge didn't open?
4855200	4859040	How confusing I might have to do a different mission
4860280	4864840	I'm not sure what the game wants of me. Yeah, all those guys have just spawned back in as well
4866040	4870960	I'm not supposed to get every single one and that's the the deal
4873080	4881920	So what I take a left destroy them all left side, and then it should open up wherever I'm missing
4886880	4890160	Get one oh he's too big
4895840	4897840	That was a bit cheap
4898480	4903120	Okay, no
4905920	4910440	And then what defeat this guy that's everything in the area defeated
4911880	4915680	I'm being trolled of this platform doesn't come down right I'm being trolled
4915680	4917760	I may have to quit this one. I don't know what I'm supposed to do
4918760	4921040	The game is tied to frames per second
4928840	4934480	I always interest and see how others play this game. You need to collect all the wee orbs
4939200	4942200	I need to be 30 frames per second
4944760	4946760	Is that real
4949520	4955360	Oh my god, it's so bitty. What oh my god, it's so bitty though
4957840	4959840	Oh
4961320	4963320	My god, oh
4965680	4967680	This looks awful though

5176240	5180840	Fly from all the way up there over there. I think so. Oh, there's a ledge
5180840	5185840	It's a ledge now. Don't be fooled by the layout of this game. There's a lot of ledges
5187760	5191800	That kind of just pop it nowhere. Okay, let's try that again
5193280	5198200	Okay, easy peasy. Let me squeeze it. That was exactly what I was supposed to do. I was like a guy

6173140	6176220	Curious, I don't think I've heard that or seen gameplay of that game
6177020	6180420	Stony, thank you for making my tentacles so happy. Oh, yeah
6181340	6183660	Be a little accomplished great things. I'm not

6190460	6192660	Pat pat pat get Wilson. Thank you
6193020	6198420	First and foremost, it's a pleasure to finally meet our father-in-law. Let me introduce
6199220	6204620	Ourselves. We are the reeflings. Let me tell you that your daughter is the most amazing. Alright, I'll give it to my dad

6211460	6217860	Squids can't extend their tentacles to 20 to 40 ms, which is about 10 times faster than they blink
6217860	6220180	They are really impressive since they don't use any
6220940	6228340	Spring like mechanism. They only use their powerful muscles for this which can rear be rearranged in a crisscross pattern
6228340	6234820	I don't know that imagine a tiny reefling growing a 30-foot tentacle and striking out with it at lightning speeds to defend
6234820	6238060	Mummy in danger. That was so wholesome. You could have gone somewhere else with that
6239180	6241180	so
6242180	6244180	Um
6245220	6251260	Normally she be streams and she be doesn't have a public stream today. No, it's okay. Don't worry. Is she doing a member stream today?

6263380	6266700	I promise I'd stream longer if I could but I
6267580	6272660	Think I'm ready to throw up and I think I'm doing a mercy modest in the duck again
6273420	6277820	My stomach does not feel right. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna redirect into this lovely girl
6277820	6283700	I'll say hi for like a millisecond, but I need to go light and I'm so sorry reeflings. I apologize
6284260	6289260	But we did we give spiral a little bash. Thank you so much for watching me stumble through this game

6296100	6299340	I think the new schedule starts up, but I need to change that way
6299340	6304100	But thank you so so much and I'll see you goofy go bers tomorrow. Say hi to a
