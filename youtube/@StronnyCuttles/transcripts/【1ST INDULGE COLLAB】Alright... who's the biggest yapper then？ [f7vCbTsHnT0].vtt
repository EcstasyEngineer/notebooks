07:21.080 --> 07:26.760
around five years old my dad would always pester me about getting a boyfriend he would always be

07:26.760 --> 07:32.680
like oh your friend your friend ashley has a boyfriend why don't you have a boyfriend and so one day

07:32.680 --> 07:37.560
he asked me again and i got really really fed up so obviously i didn't have a boyfriend

07:38.920 --> 07:43.720
so what i told him he asked me again like oh do you have a boyfriend in me

07:45.160 --> 07:49.320
i said the name of the only boy that both me and my dad knew

07:51.000 --> 07:55.480
and do you want to know whose name i said who i said what was my boyfriend your brother

07:56.200 --> 08:02.600

08:06.280 --> 08:08.600
kastin a little too good over here what the heck

08:13.720 --> 08:19.160
mersey my cringiest moment my entire life is a cringe

08:19.240 --> 08:24.680
oh so it's hard to pick out one so i guess my most

08:25.320 --> 08:35.320
cringiest moment i can think of is like oh i really was tuney like real tuney back in like

08:35.320 --> 08:41.480
middle school and elementary school i would refer to myself as like third person and then i would

08:41.480 --> 08:49.880
be like yes yes i can control the wind oh i can control the wind and i was born in a family of like

08:50.760 --> 08:56.600
i don't remember what i fucking said i think i was like you know it was like a phoenix a phoenix angels or

08:56.600 --> 09:04.920
something i was so cringe hell yeah azura oh no

09:13.560 --> 09:22.360
i relate a lot to mersey just kidding sorry oh no look all right hear me out all right i'm

09:22.840 --> 09:26.920
sure everyone has a moment when they were a kid you know

09:29.480 --> 09:32.120
i used to pretend to be an animal

09:37.960 --> 09:46.840
and i would run around on all floors in an empty park oh that's normal for a kid yeah but some kids

09:46.920 --> 09:51.640
my school caught me oh no it's all right i barked at people

10:02.440 --> 10:09.720
okay i think i think i can finally speak now okay so my uh

10:10.680 --> 10:18.920
cringiest and most embarrassing memory is when i was in elementary school

10:21.080 --> 10:28.280
at the end of the year we had like this uh thing where we did a lot of different dances

10:28.840 --> 10:34.200
and everyone's parents would show up to like a big like area to see that

10:34.920 --> 10:41.960
so we would practice the dances and stuff and i was like so confident and sure that like i

10:41.960 --> 10:52.280
remember my dance moves and everything and so we're all like sitting down uh and there is like

10:52.280 --> 10:58.040
a certain like specific part in the song when we need to get up and like start the actual dance

10:58.200 --> 11:07.320
mm so the music starts and then you see me the only one who gets up to a fucking early

11:08.040 --> 11:15.800
and starts dancing and then i realize that it's too fucking early and i'm just looking at

11:15.800 --> 11:25.800
everyone around me it's so fucking embarrassing like and like slowly sitting back no this little

11:25.800 --> 11:36.360
sit down of defeat yeah it was so embarrassing well let's see if i can beat all of their cringe

11:36.360 --> 11:45.320
stories lads so i've always been uh sleeping during the day and up during the night and i had a

11:45.320 --> 11:51.720
dentist appointment i was incredibly delirious because of the time it was at was actually in

11:51.720 --> 12:02.840
my bedtime and if you didn't know the tongue is an exploratory muscle that you have so for around

12:02.840 --> 12:10.680
15 minutes while i'm getting my teeth cleaned i essentially used i was really tired okay to be

12:10.680 --> 12:16.520
fair but i essentially sucked and licked on this old man's fingers at my dentist and i didn't even

12:16.520 --> 12:23.560
realize i did it until i got home because i was so delirious so this per man was like trying to

12:23.560 --> 12:29.720
oh he liked that no he was like trying to help me get my teeth clean he was like oh yeah no

12:29.720 --> 12:38.120
everything looks good and i'm just like like it haunts me to this day so that that's my

12:38.120 --> 12:48.120
reduced memory no he totally liked that he jorked off to that later right right right right

12:48.120 --> 12:55.080
on a more positive note how about we share what happy memories you have any any happy memory

12:55.080 --> 12:58.600
it doesn't matter what it is well we start with ac this time and work our way back up

12:59.480 --> 13:13.720
okay um my happiest memory is from when i was a child and basically my grandpa had this summer

13:13.720 --> 13:22.920
house that he had built and my grandma and grandpa they had like a small farm in that house and so we

13:22.920 --> 13:32.520
would go there a lot of times so that happy memory happens there because there's this one time when

13:32.520 --> 13:41.560
me my mom and my grandma we went to sit on the tall grass outside and it was very cloudy and my mom

13:41.560 --> 13:51.640
was like reading like a book story to me and then it started raining so we went inside and i remember

13:51.640 --> 14:00.360
just my mom like making me tea and my grandma getting some fresh strawberries that she picked up

14:00.360 --> 14:07.800
and giving it to me and just you know the nice scenery of the rain and the clouds while meeting like

14:07.800 --> 14:15.720
fresh strawberries looking at my Barbie magazines just i don't know there's something about that memory

14:15.720 --> 14:25.400
that is like the happiest i've ever felt in my entire life really so beautiful that's so my

14:26.280 --> 14:28.280
uh-huh has there

14:31.240 --> 14:47.480
well uh well last year my my cat did pass away um but my happiest memories were of us chasing each

14:47.480 --> 14:55.080
other around the house uh i'd play you know hide and seek with him i'd hide and he'd look

14:55.080 --> 15:01.960
for me and sometimes he'd also hide and wait to scare me and then we'd later duke it out

15:06.360 --> 15:07.560
my cat is the same

15:07.800 --> 15:19.960
memory um i guess when i was a kid um

15:22.680 --> 15:31.560
mama and papa would uh we we didn't have a lot so the most distinct memory is of me receiving my

15:31.560 --> 15:45.080
first gift from them um which was a vhs a vhs uh movie of pokemon the first movie and i was so happy

15:45.080 --> 15:50.840
because that was the first time i've ever realized like what gifts were you know all day

15:51.640 --> 15:53.640
oh

16:00.920 --> 16:07.640
okay well a happy memory of mine is um i used to have this rat called medkip uh

16:08.600 --> 16:14.600
she died a couple months ago but um she was my oldest living rat and she lived for almost three years

16:14.600 --> 16:21.880
and that's really long for a rat they they don't live long so before she died i took her

16:21.880 --> 16:26.200
outside of the house on a walk to the park and she stayed on my shoulder the whole time

16:26.760 --> 16:33.640
and and we just sat um on the grass at the park and we watched the sunset together oh that's so precious

16:35.880 --> 16:40.440
and i carried her in my sweater on the way home and she pooped all in my sweater

16:45.000 --> 16:53.960
um so as i mentioned in my debut i really love fantasy and um when i was younger my

16:53.960 --> 16:59.720
grandparents took me to a renaissance fair and i got to dress up as like a little

17:00.440 --> 17:07.480
little renaissance girl little princess and when i went they had the joust and i was selected to

17:07.480 --> 17:15.000
give my favor to this lady knight and so she won her joust and then i got to give her a little like

17:15.000 --> 17:24.120
favor on her um lance and i just felt like all of my dreams had come true like i was a part of

17:24.120 --> 17:35.400
a fairy tale it was just i loved it so much it was so wholesome uh for my happy memory um so my dad

17:35.400 --> 17:39.960
takes me game shopping as a child it's all childhood all of us were like childhood childhood

17:41.320 --> 17:49.000
um so i couldn't read at the time like i was very young so i would go to the game shop with my dad

17:49.000 --> 17:54.040
and look at the covers on the games and then present it to him and then he would judge if the game

17:54.040 --> 18:02.440
was worthy enough for me to play or not so it was like some judgment of like um is this quality

18:02.440 --> 18:08.600
enough for strawney a player or not um but it also led me to getting into a lot of like cooler

18:08.600 --> 18:14.920
games that i wouldn't have had access to like mech assault or halo these kind of games so i'm very

18:14.920 --> 18:20.760
thankful for my dad um it's just like such a goofy little memory of being like please dad can i get

18:20.760 --> 18:30.760
this game and be like no no that's not good enough for you strawney okay and then that's adorable now we

18:30.760 --> 18:39.480
do need chat participation for this next one okay we're playing two truths and a lie chat do you
