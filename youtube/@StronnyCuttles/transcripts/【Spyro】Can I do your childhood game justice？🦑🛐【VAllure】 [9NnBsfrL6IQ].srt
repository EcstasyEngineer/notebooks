00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
lea wearing the bodyguard

2
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,240
hallo

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,240
you hear me get him

4
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:37,840
Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. We just trying not to be so loud for once in

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,200
a while. Does your dad use those fancy made up scotch words like gobsheet and bampo? A

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,920
wee bit. He's much worse lying than me. Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. I'm

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:03,880
trying to be a wee bit quieter. But that's because my dad's here. I'm trying to be so

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:15,120
quiet. I think he's still asleep. So, but I had the worst day ever yesterday. I'm so

9
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,800
sorry I couldn't tell you. I didn't want anyone tracking his flight. I didn't want

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:30,280
any weirdness. So my dad's here. I was violently car sick yesterday. So I feel awful. I've

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,440
had five hours sleep. I didn't have my nap. I don't even know if I've had five hours straight

12
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,440
to be honest. But we're gonna we're gonna figure out this game one way or another. So this

13
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:49,400
is Spyro, which may or may not be your childhood game. Because it's not mine. It's still my

14
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:59,480
game. My master. No, I've not played it before. So Crash Bandicoot got remastered and so did

15
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,720
Spyro. So I don't know if it's the same studio or if it was just rival studios that were

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,360
smart enough to re-release classic games. Like if they re-release cameo. So I'm jumping

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,360
right back on that. Thank you for streaming despite being a game, but also self care one.

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:26,200
Well, I have, I don't know what we're gonna do about ASMR streams because so my dad passed

19
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:34,800
out and he's got his own room in over him. And his snoring is so loud. I don't think I

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:43,840
can do ASMR for the next three weeks. I'm really unsure what's gonna happen. I beat the second

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Spyro over at my best friend's house. I'm surprised you never played this. I don't know if Spyro

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,600
came out after, I mean before Crash Bandicoot. There we go. I have no idea. No dad snoring

23
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,120
ASMR. Oh, he like proper snores the house then. The bloody cats are scared of him. Gimli

24
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:13,280
and Vigo didn't come out. But yeah, I'm so sorry for the entire, we're gonna give Spyro

25
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:23,360
a shot. I assume it's Spyro the dragon I'm supposed to do, right? Yeah, seems right. That

26
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,280
was fine. 100% question mark. They need to get used to them. Yeah, they do not. Gimli

27
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,080
and Vigo. Oh my god, they have cutscenes.

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:42,640
Okay, rolling. Oh, it's been peaceful here in the five worlds, or is it six? For a dragon

29
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:51,280
to eat, you now have 12,000 treasure, or is it 14,000? What about this Ganasty Gannok

30
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,240
character? Now, I'm a Ganasty magic spell to turn gems into warriors for his cause. I'll

31
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:12,400
gentle confirmed. Wait. So yeah, I'm gonna give your childhood game a shot. See what I think,

32
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,640
because I share my childhood game all the time, so it's time for me to play a new game.

33
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:30,320
Wait, they have old music. Wait, why didn't... Oh, he talks.

34
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,400
Wait, why didn't he make me green?

35
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,320
Is this a remake of the original Spyro? It is.

36
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,800
So X is charged, B is flamed. Is it unlimited? I don't really see a bar. What's Y?

37
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:08,320
What's Y? X at look. Hold on, sorry. Wait, right trigger is attack as well.

38
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,280
What's this? Rescued nest. I didn't do anything. I walked forward, sir. Please,

39
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
please do not give me more accolades for things I didn't do.

40
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,040
Oh my god. Thank you, hit Vocaloid, Iniku Hatsune, for becoming a member.

41
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,840
What about NastyNork? I'm going after him. I'm going to find dragons first.

42
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,560
That's all I can tell you. Right, we're to find dragons.

43
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,400
I mean, I think it's as simple as that. I'm going to say no. Right, there's a green one over there.

44
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Oh, I can fly with wings. Delvin. That Miku? Oh my god, she literally...

45
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,600
NastyNork out towards you. Keep your horns on, Spyro. You have much to learn.

46
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
So I'm a baby dragon. Do you know what the dragon fly following you is doing?

47
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,440
His name is Sparks and he's helping me protect you. Keep an eye on him and see what I mean.

48
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,520
Please... where is this?

49
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,640
Oh, I missed.

50
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,480
Wait, I can't touch water? Is it because I'm a dragon?

51
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:46,160
Okay, sorry, I'm just getting used to this. I've almost perished because I'm a dumber.

52
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Oh, I'm locked to place. Do I want to go there? Does it matter where you go?

53
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,760
I do see portals going out and Joes don't read your health.

54
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,880
Oh, he looks so messed up.

55
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,000
Old video games and conditions to expect water to always be lethal.

56
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Literally, I didn't realize I was hurting myself. That was a bit of an oversight from me.

57
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,680
Oh, I've got my cup of tea. Treasure found. Oh no, is this like 100% the game to progress?

58
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,120
Or is it just... you can go wherever you want. Oh, okay.

59
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
But yeah, how are you guys? Other than... oh my god, what?

60
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
Are you squid merit? I've just come for the worst, like one.

61
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,960
Mama dipping into my childhood on my 24th birthday.

62
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh, birthday.

63
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,640
Best present ever. I hope you have a fun.

64
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,760
Oh my god, happy 24th birthday.

65
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,680
Snowberry smoothie. That's such a cute name. Thank you for the 20 as well.

66
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,240
Yeah, I'm trying to play your childhood games. Oh no, the controls are embedded.

67
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,600
I assume I go for the barrels, right? Oh gosh.

68
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,080
All right. No, okay, okay. I thought we were gonna like lose momentum or something,

69
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,600
but I'm gonna just follow the rail track.

70
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,400
But yeah, basically, I cannot travel at all. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

71
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,440
Because I'm memeing about this convention and stuff,

72
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
and I could hardly be in a flipping taxi.

73
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,480
Get right. Oh my god, I'm actually so smart with a heck. I love kids games.

74
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,640
I love games that are really obvious what you're supposed to do.

75
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know what the heck this is, but I did spot it.

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,720
Plus three. Time? Oh, I need it for something? Time's up. Would you like to retry?

77
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:02,960
Huh? I'm to do eight planes, eight chests, eight trains, and eight arches.

78
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Is that not?

79
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Have I just picked the hardest mission to start on? Actually, if actually.

80
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,560
I see a chest this time.

81
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,960
Oh, I'm on the floor. Oh, indeed.

82
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,080
Okay, I'm up to something else. I don't think I'm supposed to do that one first.

83
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
You have to get all of the things before the time runs out.

84
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
Right, we're not doing any flight missions. I said what I said.

85
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Oh, but my health is regen. Doesn't even do anything for that.

86
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,400
Okay, what are you smelling?

87
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
What does he do?

88
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:57,840
Getting around him. That doesn't seem like a nice thing to do, but oh, they're scared of me.

89
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Okay, we'll take it.

90
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,560
Getting things gives you time back though. Oh, okay.

91
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,320
Okay, let's try whatever this mission is. I'm so sorry. I really don't...

92
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,400
I don't... I don't play this game. Hopefully I do it justice.

93
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,840
And yeah, and I don't sound too sick. I had to take quills, which is anti-sickness medicine,

94
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
and it takes away all the saliva in your mouth, and it's still in effect right now.

95
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,520
I think it ages ago. And my mouth is all dry, and my voice is all cracked because I was talking to

96
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:47,840
my dad, but my freaking throat was so dry, so I completely messed up.

97
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,080
But I've got to see my dad at the airport.

98
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh my god, the poor taxi driver. He had to stop for me twice.

99
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
That ram looks so menacing in the distance right now.

100
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,960
Yes, I'm drinking it. I'm gonna see if I can finish my tea.

101
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,480
My freaking thigh. Oh, that was quite the voice crack if you heard that.

102
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,880
And my freaking... I was like gagging and throwing up. I had to ask the poor taxi man to

103
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,160
go to the side of the road for me. I had to... I was like begging him to put the window down on that,

104
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,160
and I almost threw it outside the car, like down the side of the freaking thing.

105
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,480
I have really bad car sickness. It's literally my biggest weakness, you know.

106
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
You guys are like, oh, Strony. Oh my god, hi, little fly.

107
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
Strony, how do you stream every single day? That's not possible. Oh, you're so strong.

108
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,760
You're so brave. No, my biggest weakness is cars. I can't be in cars. I can't be in buses.

109
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,640
I have been on a boat and not had any issues.

110
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,040
They had to nerf me somewhere in its cars. You know how the world relies on transport

111
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,400
to get anywhere, and I just use my bike to go to the shops. Yeah, there's a reason why I'm not

112
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,200
interested. Although, I read things that said if you get motion sickness in cars, but if you're the

113
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:25,600
driver, you don't get the same motion sickness. I literally watch me go to a convention in a

114
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,920
America and be like, right, that's me heading off now. And it's like four weeks before. And

115
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,480
everyone's like, what the fuck? And it's because I have to get a fucking boat.

116
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,560
The mobility buff is strong. Literally, I can hardly even leave the damn house.

117
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,240
Oh, okay. You threw up four, oh, four times in the car.

118
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,280
Fuck you. I can ram you too. Hold on. Gen two ram girl confirmed.

119
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,040
Just head on collision. Oh, sorry, the camera's a bit funky.

120
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,720
Try to get used to it. There's a camera just to when I move. No, you have to constantly do the

121
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,120
right except one is speed up.

122
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
Right, you and you. What's this?

123
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,080
Dragon.

124
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Rescued Gildas. Hello. Oh, you're a painter.

125
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,600
Go for it.

126
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,000
And try pressing the action button to drop down midflying.

127
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,800
Listen, Glading just bad flying. What's this? Can you like 100% this game? Oh, why did you spank me?

128
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,200
Well, this, if he's telling me about Glading, I assume there's another dragon somewhere here.

129
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,600
It's just a, I have about a 3D with girl for gen two. That is terrible. I really want to develop

130
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:19,600
a legion, like a Roman legionary. Okay. What are these? Hello. Do you have coins inside you?

131
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:32,000
Have to do them. Oh, wait, it's out of bounds. This is out of bounds, I think. Okay, sorry.

132
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,320
I'm being a dumb dumb. What are you?

133
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,560
Are you running away from me? Nice try. Wait, he's actually kind of fast.

134
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,440
Wait, he's got an egg on him. Can I birth more dragons?

135
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,880
I will single handedly rise the dragon population.

136
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,680
Okay, I can cut corners. Oh, we're getting closer. I actually caught a few more corners and he's done for it.

137
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,560
I've got a special egg. What did that do? Torches as the egg thieves. Did he steal from us?

138
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,920
That's a jam right here.

139
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,280
I can climb. I think I can climb. I don't know if I'm supposed to climb or not.

140
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,960
I could, I don't know if I could produce dragons. That's quite a tall order.

141
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,480
You order. I don't know if you guys are in TikTok but there's this Scottish TikTok

142
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,200
like Chinese takeaway and she's like, it's called like Rebecca Box or whatever and it's like,

143
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:00,560
let's pack this customer's order. But she goes like genuinely, goes like order with her voice

144
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,760
and it just reminds me of when I say wild guard. There'll be like one person that knows exactly

145
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,520
what I'm talking about and everyone else is like, what are you on about, strongy? I swear.

146
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,640
We don't need chess. Okay, wait, how many dragons are there per level?

147
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,280
Asked or? Do you like the intro?

148
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,000
After you freeze all the dragons, the book will fry. Maybe a dragon girl would be fun for them too.

149
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,800
Wouldn't that be adorable? Wouldn't she be just the cute little bunny?

150
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:44,560
Anyway, I did not listen to what that was meant to. I think she's healing me when she does that.

151
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,520
Generally, three or four, the men you should tell you. Oh, if I press start.

152
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,880
Okay, okay, so there's two more dragons. We're gonna go this way then because we're not

153
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,760
going this way. I think I spawned here. Excuse me. Thank you.

154
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,080
Okay, stop. I actually love how simple this game is. I actually am enjoying it very much.

155
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,080
I'm so sorry if I don't fit something very enthusiastic today. I'm one tired baby.

156
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,680
I was hanging about at the airport for ages. My dad said his luggage just wasn't coming,

157
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,840
but I did it. What? I can't break titanium. Oh, come on.

158
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,560
Pardon me. How strong are my horns if I can do that?

159
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,760
These games in my childhood, two and three are so much better though. Oh no, I picked the worst one.

160
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:46,320
As your dad doing, he never slept for like 48 hours. He did not see a bed, so he's had better days.

161
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,320
No way. No way. I perfectly fucking had the gamer sense to know where the heck this dragon is.

162
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,200
You are a dragon and you're very strong. It's good to start here, but to his best.

163
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,480
The others just add a lot more elements to them.

164
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,320
What? Does he sound like the perfect old weeb? Oh, sure.

165
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,200
Okay, thank you for releasing this though. Right, so exit level and we get to keep everything?

166
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,920
I assume we get to keep everything. It's not like one of those games.

167
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,840
Returning to artisan.

168
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Yes. Okay, it did let me keep it.

169
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,960
Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me. Come through. I just need a portal. That's all.

170
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,880
Let's stay. Oh, I'm scared to do any flight stuff though. It's like a flight mission,

171
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,400
so as I'll come back later, mate, I'm no interested right now. I'm too rubbish at it.

172
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Was there a portal over here? You missed the gem. It didn't save the gem.

173
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,840
You need to collect gems if you want to do 100%? I've got a life for doing that.

174
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
The dark hollow. Ooh, the haunted.

175
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,200
But I have no idea how long we're going to play for actually. He should be waking up soon,

176
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
if I'm being honest. I'm trying to be quiet. I don't want to wake because he was like,

177
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,480
oh, you're not going to be that loud when you play games, are you? And I'm like,

178
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
you're joking, right? I'll be screaming down the mic.

179
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,800
But yes, when she becomes up, I think I'll redirect into her. I have no idea how long

180
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,440
this game takes to finish. They're attacking me. No, you're not supposed to actually attack me.

181
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:58,560
Right, we need three dragons. There's three frogs. Oh, wait, the frogs are healing up my dragonfly?

182
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,280
Oh, the dragonfly's eating the boos. Oh, wait.

183
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,960
Oh, sorry, I love the combat because it's so easy.

184
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,960
How many hits can I take in a really quick few?

185
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,440
Okay, oh, there's a dragon here. Darius. Four hits and I'm out.

186
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,880
I pray that your dad's a deep sleeper. Well, I don't know if we can do ASMR streams and I'm like,

187
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,640
oh my god, three weeks? No ASMR stream seems bizarre because literally it's my main focus.

188
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,680
I have entered the battle zone. Oh, yes, hell come here. Okay, feed drags. Okay, drags is back to being

189
00:20:51,680 --> 00:21:05,520
focused. If we do end up doing no ASMR streams for three weeks, I pinky promise I will make

190
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,920
no, don't return home. I don't even got the other dragons yet. I pinky promise I will do like,

191
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,040
I'll shut you not like, back to back ASMR stream type stuff.

192
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:26,640
Neat glide from up here. You light the campfire.

193
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,440
Oh, we flings, we're camping.

194
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,880
Ew, that's so cute. I prefer when you play games though. Oh, I think,

195
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,760
I know everyone's got their, oh my god, I'm actually so smart for figuring that out.

196
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,480
Oh, life. The only time I can get a life is in video games, swing school.

197
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh, I don't think I've been done this way. Nope. We'll do fine. We'll cry, but we'll do fine.

198
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,680
Oh, okay, again, right. So the big guy is fire.

199
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Sorry, I'm trying to get used to this. Whoa, what? Can I only get his buff?

200
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,480
Oh no. Oh, I'm getting scared. Stop, stop. I'm actually scared. That scared me. Please don't do

201
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,880
that again. Put him away, yeah, man. Honestly, just a moment. I'm not doing it.

202
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,840
All right, you do it. He's smart too. I forgot that part. Stop.

203
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,320
Why does he have such a generic like spiral? Whoa, there's a key.

204
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,920
Okay, Reefling, it's time to lock up and give me,

205
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm just the key dude. Must unlock his secret door.

206
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm looking at the map. I don't know where my last dragon is.

207
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,800
He's like, hardly patrolling. Yeah. Does he even care?

208
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:23,280
Okay, geez. That was like so hard to grab him.

209
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:35,120
Aspire was a generic 90s teenager. Oh yeah, right. I'm on it. Like that's what I'm getting from him.

210
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,280
Can't flea mill, can't ram big. Grilled his butt. That was my only option. Oh, it's never going up.

211
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,920
He must be up there, head over here.

212
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,880
Hominah, hominah, hominah, hominah.

213
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,880
Oh, it has a key.

214
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,920
Oh, this is like such a polite little game. Okay, we can fire that one.

215
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,200
Okay, sorry, but this game is actually so fair. I love it. I just think I'm just going to be a

216
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,000
professional child's game like reviewer and stuff. It's because I suck at games.

217
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
Whoa, the Spiral Vs.

218
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
Taken over the mic? Well.

219
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,160
I like how the dragons are actually tutorials as well. That's so nice. I like it.

220
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:42,880
Okay, so if I, I'm not to leave, I'm to use the portal, which is over here.

221
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,400
Aspire's speedruns are quite the experience. Oh, we're in speedrunning.

222
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm just going to try and collect as many dragons as I can before I go offline.

223
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,760
I'm going to have to definitely change up some of my schedule though.

224
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,040
Uh, I like how cute the game is. I don't know how easy it is to 100% with the gems or whatever.

225
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,080
Actually, it wouldn't be impossible. All right, we'll have with them. Right, I'm not

226
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,280
doing the fine mission because it sucks, so there must be another mission. You know,

227
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,360
something about this castle up here? Ah, the platform's here.

228
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,360
You're perfectly qualified for video game journalism then, and ironically,

229
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,680
what's this? Hello.

230
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,320
Knock, knock. I'm Spyro. Please let me in. Is that like the end of it?

231
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,800
Hmm, we did the haunted mansion. We did that one. I don't know what this one is.

232
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,200
Most of the gems are just hanging out in the world.

233
00:25:51,440 --> 00:26:01,440
Oh. Resued Thomas. Congrats if your name's Thomas. I'll try and talk to you later, Thomas.

234
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,960
Oh, man. Yeah, of course. Thanks for the advice.

235
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,720
Stop. You're so generic. I love them.

236
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,280
Turn square. Oh yeah, we're going to civilization.

237
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:41,600
Hmm. Yeah, I was really sick. I had to go to a bakery at the airport. I paid $5.50 for a tiny

238
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:51,040
little lemonade bottle, and I had to get a sick bag off of her. I was like, I'm so sorry to ask,

239
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,880
but do you sell plastic bags at all? And she was like, I'm so sorry, I don't. And I was like,

240
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,440
do you, is it okay if I can buy a little paper bag off of you because I needed something to

241
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,600
be sick in in case I was sick on the way back? And she was like, oh no, it's fine. You can just

242
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,800
have it for free, darling. I think she could see I was like sick as fuck whilst I'm waiting for my

243
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:20,240
freaking dad. The same voice actor as SpongeBob. That's fantastic. Welcome to Town Square. None of

244
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:30,400
the dragons are re... None of the dragons are being reused. Like, they're all designed new. This is

245
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,520
so good. Okay, right. I assume I rammed them from behind. Oh no, I can burn them as well.

246
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,720
Uh, jump. I can't imagine paying for a bag like that. Well, in Scotland, you have to pay for any

247
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:58,560
bags you take away. Want me to ram it and jump? Okay. And like, I don't want to get in trouble or

248
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,960
anything for doing, like, for not thinking. So I was just like, oh, can I pay for these? She was

249
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,640
like, nah, just take it for free. You already got scum assed on the lemonade. Like, when you risk

250
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:21,360
you all doing empire. You do. So in Scotland, it's set up, you have to pay for like those takeaway bags

251
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,400
from any shop or whatever. And it's supposed to go to charity, but obviously it started it,

252
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,640
there were gonna be five pence, but then it's obviously changed to whatever the fuck they

253
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,280
want to charge because they make a profit on that, you know. I assume if I get a hundred gems.

254
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, I just made him perish.

255
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:56,800
The odd thing is that this is how the OG game looks in my memory. I'm always like that with

256
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,840
video games. Like, when I played Brotherhood, I was like, oh my god, this game's aged a little bit.

257
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,280
Like, just go to the graphics and stuff. And I was like, wait, I don't remember like Brotherhood

258
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:13,680
being the most top notch thing I've ever seen in my life. You're using your gamer

259
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,040
instincts. I mean, it's winning.

260
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,920
The egg. Uh, that would be me. If I was a dragon, I'm like, oh, I'm winded me.

261
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,000
I think there is a guy back here, but I don't know how to get there. No, I don't want to jump

262
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:44,160
back down. Well, it's more than 10 years old now at the time. It was so good.

263
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:53,520
So red. Hold on. I'm really struggling with the camera angle from being honest. I don't know.

264
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,440
I don't know if it's janky for you guys, but I had to get up there.

265
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,160
I don't claim on the phone. What? I don't claim on the phone.

266
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,640
Huh. Hold on. Let's just have the camera's wear back in the day.

267
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Can I jump up in the very far now? No. Hmm. My gamer senses. Oh, no. What?

268
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,760
The game wouldn't force you to restart a mission if you're not complete it. How many

269
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,200
have I got? Yeah, I'm missing a dragon.

270
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,360
You had the right idea of gliding.

271
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,000
I didn't see platform that I'm supposed to go on though.

272
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,520
When you hear an an an an an, it means there's an egg thief nearby.

273
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:09,760
Sorry. Glide from the top of the stairs to the egg thief.

274
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,640
This can't be. No. Oh, wait. Maybe it was. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute,

275
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,760
Riefling. So you actually are so right. Hold on.

276
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,840
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I just need to give it a really hard turn.

277
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,760
I don't know how you're supposed to figure this stuff out on your own child's game,

278
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:38,400
by the way. Oh, we did it. Glade to the secret egg thief in the town square. Okay, I can do that.

279
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,920
Where is he? He can jump. I'm gonna make him jump. Did it make me jump down?

280
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,920
It did. I need to go all the way back.

281
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,920
Yeah, I definitely can't reach that. Okay.

282
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,400
As if I missed it. How embarrassing. Anyone remember the live-action commercials of the

283
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:12,880
creepy sheep protesting this game? Someone protested Spyro before.

284
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,600
Backseat successful. Yes, you're more than welcome to backseat me. I have absolutely

285
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,680
no issues with it. I am but a humble crybaby colfish.

286
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,920
I don't know what I'm doing and I'm more than happy to be told what to do.

287
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,680
And no, do not add like a good girl at the end of that.

288
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay, we did it.

289
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
It's quick, so that's fine. You're the clunk, clunk, clunk.

290
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,800
Sorry.

291
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,560
The back door is back on the main.

292
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:05,120
This Skyrim commercials had the cheap protests and oh the sheep

293
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,400
protests in the game because you hurt the sheep to get your HP back.

294
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,680
I haven't developed the urge to click gems on site. I don't know. You guys said it's easy,

295
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,560
but I don't trust myself that it's actually easy. Yet.

296
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,480
I'm not looking forward to this flight mission, but I think it's the only one we've not done yet.

297
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,120
Wait, is the game seriously over after the flight mission? Can I be?

298
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,160
Can I be?

299
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,160
All right, I think it is the flight mission time.

300
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,760
No, it's not over. The hot air balloon takes you to a new world.

301
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,680
I hope you hurt my destiny.

302
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,600
Right, we'll give this place a shot again.

303
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,160
If we don't get anywhere, we'll go speak to the hot, I'm sorry,

304
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,760
we'll go speak to the hot balloon guy.

305
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm sorry, little sprax.

306
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,720
There are five flight missions, one in the world. I've got another five worlds.

307
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,520
The only legitimate challenger in the first fire games are the flight missions.

308
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,840
The bosses aren't even responsible.

309
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,400
There are, right.

310
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,720
Oh, I did. Oh, okay. You didn't see that. You honestly didn't see that.

311
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,160
How about we just go to the next world?

312
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,800
Yeah, I agree. We should just go to the next world.

313
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,160
A freaking priced X thinking it was going to flamethrower.

314
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,040
I'm so sorry.

315
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,480
I was so freaking sorry. That was so bad.

316
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,320
I'm actually so embarrassed. I don't want to do that.

317
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Do you hear me? Do you spank me with a heel?

318
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,360
No, you don't. I don't know what you do.

319
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,040
Right, no one saw that.

320
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
We're just going to move on to the next world

321
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,760
and because we've totally done all the missions in this one.

322
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,840
I missed our hot air balloon guy.

323
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,520
Hello. Wow, I see you.

324
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,120
I see you've been busy rescuing dragon Spyro.

325
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,000
Yes.

326
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,440
You may travel to the peacekeepers world if you like.

327
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,880
Are you ready to go?

328
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,600
Yeah, let's go.

329
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,240
The fairies just to check point.

330
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,800
Flight mission.

331
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,080
What flight mission literally starts the flight mission

332
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,200
instantly goes on the water?

333
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,080
Yeah, all right then.

334
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,840
Okay, talk about MLG Pro.

335
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,960
The flight missions are optional.

336
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,560
Oh, the developers.

337
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,280
I could spiral developer team.

338
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,360
Thank you for letting me skip the flight mission.

339
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,800
I didn't see a dragon.

340
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,240
Okay, let's see this new area.

341
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,960
What? Hello.

342
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
I hear an enemy.

343
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,880
Titan.

344
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,680
Those devs owe me.

345
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,720
Wow, what an interesting color scheme.

346
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Wait, I guess because they're dragons,

347
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,640
they won their money.

348
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,760
Oh, here he is.

349
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
Here's cannon.

350
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,280
I'm just a wee dragon.

351
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,040
Why are you cannonballing me?

352
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,320
Why are you shooting me?

353
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,960
That's really, I'm just a wee dragon.

354
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,080
Right, dry canyon.

355
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,800
Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it.

356
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
Can't wait to see your reaction to a boss.

357
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,200
You will laugh.

358
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:43,360
You gotta do some yard work.

359
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,520
Oh, you can move in the little wooden thing.

360
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,600
You skip the boss level for the art level.

361
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
Is that what was behind the door?

362
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,680
How did I get through the door?

363
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,040
You didn't say it, but I thought it though.

364
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,080
Oh, funny.

365
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm sorry.

366
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
And Kana needs you to eat that.

367
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Oh, I didn't mean to do that to the other one.

368
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,120
That's this knock knock.

369
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,600
Okay.

370
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,680
Oh, can I just go?

371
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,840
I'm just going to send it by the pope.

372
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,600
I just checked the price for the triology too expensive.

373
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
I'd rather just spend money on one.

374
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,040
You know you're allowed to treat yourself right.

375
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,800
Thank you so much, bully legend.

376
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
Oh, I missed.

377
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,200
Sorry.

378
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Can I go the opposite way that he goes?

379
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,880
Oh, well, I got him.

380
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,720
I was going to say, can I go the opposite way he goes?

381
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,680
So I can't interact him.

382
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,640
What do you do other than get in my way?

383
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,520
Oh, he's going to shoot him.

384
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,160
Rescued coin.

385
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,600
Thank you again for the super chat, bully legend.

386
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,080
It's 12 bucks on steam.

387
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,760
You can, but he'll turn.

388
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,880
He'll run the other way.

389
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,280
I cannot believe.

390
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,200
Oh, that was water.

391
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,520
Sorry.

392
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,320
I never even saw that.

393
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,680
I was too busy focused on the guy.

394
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,080
I got an achievement for charging a vulture.

395
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,320
Sorry, you can't ram big guys.

396
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,240
But I can try.

397
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,840
Come here, everyone.

398
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,120
How many dragons are on this level?

399
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,040
There are four dragons on the, oh,

400
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,360
there are two more dragons to collect on this level.

401
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
It says it's 40 bucks for me.

402
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,840
Yeah, yeah.

403
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,200
Oh my god, I love the dialogue.

404
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,960
I was born to glide.

405
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
I love you, Spyro.

406
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,400
This game is so cute.

407
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,720
No, no, no, don't shoot.

408
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,360
Oh, sorry.

409
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,920
Wait, hold on.

410
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,800
Yay.

411
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,840
Oh, sorry.

412
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,160
I keep forgetting and then jumping.

413
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,960
Ah, oh, don't glade.

414
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,240
Glade where?

415
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,640
That wasn't rewarded for glading.

416
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,120
Oh.

417
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,160
My neck.

418
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,480
Oh, thank you for the read.

419
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,840
Kylie won.

420
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,400
I'm praying I'm sorry.

421
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,040
Thank you for the read.

422
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,760
I appreciate that.

423
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,160
Hi.

424
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,400
By the Pope, who was there?

425
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
I'm playing Spyro.

426
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,480
It's not my childhood game.

427
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,840
It's your childhood game.

428
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
And I don't know what I'm doing.

429
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,120
So I'm so sorry for the gameplay if it's frustrating.

430
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,000
But hi, readers.

431
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm Strony Quotles from Motherfucking Vela, Gen 1.

432
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,520
Indulge.

433
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,640
Get it?

434
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,200
It's a big pun because you're supposed to indulge in us.

435
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,520
Who came up with this stuff?

436
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,560
Honestly, it was me.

437
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,120
I named it.

438
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm sorry.

439
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm sorry to any of the girls that don't like her name.

440
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,640
Oh, please.

441
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,240
That can give me a few hints.

442
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh, I just got wallet.

443
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,800
Sorry.

444
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
I really need to heal, I think.

445
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,800
I think next practice is about to smack me.

446
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,360
Wait, he's not even with me?

447
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,680
I've lost my wee dragonfly.

448
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,360
Um...

449
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,680
Oh?

450
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,280
Hi.

451
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,680
Ivory.

452
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:35,680
Yeah.

453
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm the baby.

454
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,200
Oh my god, that's so cute.

455
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,920
A wee puff of smoke when hitting our die.

456
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,320
Then you go back to the start where the rabbits are.

457
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,040
I didn't see any heals.

458
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,720
All right, I don't want...

459
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,880
Oh, I'm scared.

460
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,240
Sorry, I can't see where that guy is.

461
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,440
Behind me.

462
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,240
Is there any dragon that way?

463
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,080
No.

464
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,440
I don't see any bunnies either.

465
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,360
I'll let them think they're going to win, okay?

466
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,360
There's a one behind the castle, though.

467
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,760
Oh, there is.

468
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,600
He hid over that person.

469
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,160
He came up with that as a junior.

470
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,920
I didn't see a bun bun.

471
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,960
There's no sheebie in sight to eat.

472
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,600
I was going to throw that at him.

473
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,440
I...

474
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,240
Can I glide to...

475
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,920
Oh, I definitely can glide to here.

476
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,560
What are you?

477
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,120
Fireworks?

478
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,120
Oh my god, it's the 4th of July.

479
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,160
Again, sorry to everyone that lost a finger on the 4th of July.

480
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,480
We apologize greatly for your...

481
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,280
You lost.

482
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,960
I got yanked out of nowhere.

483
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,000
That was so rude.

484
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,680
So what happens?

485
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,240
Oh, I just respawned the real last left.

486
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
Oh, but respawned all the enemies.

487
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,800
They're limited enemies.

488
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh, the vulture just not cared about me.

489
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,360
Sorry about that.

490
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,520
Okay, let's try that again.

491
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,400
Looks like I can glide over there.

492
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,240
It was like a souls-like ambush

493
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,960
when Anno literally when the guy's just waiting for you behind the door

494
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,600
and you're like, uh...

495
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,800
Oh, I literally forgot our 4th.

496
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,480
Oh, right.

497
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,600
You stop it.

498
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,560
You're upsetting me.

499
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,280
Give me that heal.

500
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,600
That's this way.

501
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,480
Oh, he doesn't.

502
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,840
I actually seem to kill him.

503
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,400
Oh, well.

504
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,440
Wait, I've already had the dragon here.

505
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,520
I just have to go backwards?

506
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,040
I can hear something all over.

507
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,600
Do not go back to that portal.

508
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,400
They must be...

509
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,440
Oh, there's my dragon here.

510
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,080
Oh, I see.

511
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,080
See him?

512
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,960
How'd I get to you?

513
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,440
Glide over there.

514
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,560
How'd I glide over there?

515
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,240
I'm investigating.

516
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
I'm thinking.

517
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,680
I'm using the environmental cues.

518
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:34,560
Oh.

519
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,280
Oh, bunny's here.

520
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,160
I'm gonna replay the games now.

521
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,600
They're so good.

522
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,320
Oh, god.

523
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,200
I just suck at them so badly.

524
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,800
If you press Y, we'll gain gliding.

525
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,600
You gain height.

526
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,880
That cuts my thing short.

527
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,480
Are you pranking me, Riefling?

528
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,120
Be honest.

529
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,800
Wait, I just hit a circle.

530
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm sorry.

531
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,840
I'm sorry.

532
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,880
I'm getting a bit confuzzled in these games, right?

533
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,520
I'm supposed to glade to get to the next wagon.

534
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,880
Which I got 100% to.

535
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,360
Right.

536
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,320
There's water here.

537
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,520
If I jump, jump, jump.

538
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,720
I've already been to the left, right?

539
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,040
I already gladed to there.

540
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,720
That ain't water.

541
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,040
Oil?

542
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:35,920
Right.

543
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,800
Okay, hold on.

544
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,160
I guess I'll go back and take a right again.

545
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,200
How many am I missing?

546
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,160
Oh, just the one.

547
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,720
Which was like back there.

548
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,440
I'm getting spoiled rotten by the algorithm at the moment.

549
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,160
I'm not even kidding.

550
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,440
And Emmy fantastically got 10,000 subscribers.

551
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,120
I'm so freaking proud of her.

552
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,720
Wait, have I been here before?

553
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,480
I mean, I've been here before.

554
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,000
I mean, I've been here before.

555
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,200
I mean, no, I have been here before.

556
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,240
I just don't remember.

557
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,720
I'll see if there's something over here.

558
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,720
I don't want to get booted off the map

559
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,720
because I'm ramming him,

560
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,120
but he's like so at the edge.

561
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:22,720
Right.

562
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,000
There was nothing even special here.

563
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,560
I love her.

564
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,360
She says dragon.

565
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,560
She says it like the wagon.

566
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,360
Dragon.

567
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,800
Oh, does it actually sound like I'm saying wagon?

568
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:41,920
Does it actually sound like I'm saying wagon to you instead of dragon?

569
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,920
If I start streaming, what do you recommend?

570
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,040
I mean, I like YouTube,

571
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,040
but I like YouTube because the rules aren't there.

572
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,960
Well, other than the recent ASMR fiasco,

573
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,200
their rules are normally pretty cut and dry

574
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,280
and it's pretty obvious what you can or can't get rid of.

575
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,000
I don't need jewels.

576
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,160
I need this wagon to the right.

577
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,880
That's over here.

578
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,600
Okay, it must be the Castello,

579
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,560
but how did I get up?

580
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,600
Whoa, I just make it look like this.

581
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,760
It has to be.

582
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,720
I don't see any.

583
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:35,680
Fuck.

584
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,320
Oh, no.

585
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,640
I have to go all the way around again

586
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,280
to try and make,

587
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,200
to try and be allowed to make that jump.

588
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,200
God, it sucks so bad.

589
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,440
You aren't far behind.

590
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,640
I'm proud of the V-Sucking.

591
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,920
No, I don't want to be first.

592
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,080
Okay, I need to just do a circle around here.

593
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,880
I'm too short.

594
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,400
Don't make fun of me.

595
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
No, I want the girls to be ahead of me.

596
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,120
I don't want to be like in the lead,

597
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,720
so I'm glad that Emmy took over.

598
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,120
I really hope Shibi can take over as well.

599
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,920
I think she can.

600
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,360
Hey, right.

601
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,080
What the heck?

602
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,000
Did I just send it?

603
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:17,920
Oh, shit.

604
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,320
Spyro, can you aim a bit better, please?

605
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:20,880
Thank you.

606
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,280
Right.

607
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:21,680
Jump.

608
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,400
Hold.

609
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,480
What?

610
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,080
I'm sure I can do it.

611
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,120
It's like so close.

612
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,320
And the VOD system is a man.

613
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,960
I also find that Twitch is only a good user experience.

614
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,960
Twitch mobile.

615
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,640
Are you squinting me right now?

616
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,720
Have you seen how to train your wagon?

617
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,680
What about the childhood shirt wagon tails?

618
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,560
Sorry, I think the way you say dragon is cute.

619
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,560
I'm saying dragon with an R.

620
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:53,280
Dragon.

621
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,960
Dragon.

622
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,000
It's not wagon.

623
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,720
Thank you for the five.

624
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,120
Veal or lover.

625
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:05,440
But oh, oh, for Spyro, buddy.

626
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,160
What was that?

627
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,280
You didn't even try to double jump.

628
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,880
I thought you could like double jump glades.

629
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,760
Ah, we're going to be here for a long time

630
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,200
if I can't even make this damn jump.

631
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,840
Then you aren't focusing.

632
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,120
You see the wagon.

633
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:21,920
Dragon.

634
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,360
Dragon.

635
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,160
My nuts on your face.

636
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:32,880
Double jump.

637
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,000
I'm trying.

638
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,680
I'm freaking missing it by a bore here.

639
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,480
Lord of Storms, thank you for the five gifted memberships.

640
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,480
Congrats to those who caught it with their face.

641
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,640
I think you do have to enable it if you're just bing chining.

642
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,200
If you're a lurker, I think the chat prompts you to enable it.

643
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,040
I'm so sorry this is taken.

644
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
I'm sure this is like a super easy jump

645
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,600
and it's just hard for me because I'm really low IQ.

646
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,680
All right, hold on.

647
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,160
Please, Spyro, please.

648
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,080
Does he actually get a boost if I press Y?

649
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,800
Because I will do it.

650
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,840
I will do it.

651
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,120
I need something to glide off to practice this Y boost.

652
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,920
Just learning curves exist for a reason.

653
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,360
What do you mean I can't be MLG pro in a child's game in two seconds flat?

654
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,320
Right, if I do, and then Y.

655
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,720
No, Y doesn't give me a freaking sec.

656
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,520
Path for the Storm.

657
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,400
I'm just trying to sleep.

658
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,040
There's no, don't contain the Scottish rage.

659
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,960
Honestly, I'm like, bro, I mean, we can always quit and go to the next mission.

660
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,280
All right, I'll give it one more shot.

661
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,440
This rest on my entire.

662
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:51,520
Okay.

663
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,600
And then right on the edge.

664
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,200
Come on.

665
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,000
I'm not going crazy or is that really hard for no reason?

666
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,960
All right, give me one more chance.

667
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,600
One more chance.

668
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,160
One more chance.

669
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,360
Just give me one more chance.

670
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:18,960
Oh, maybe you just can't do it that way.

671
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,560
Someone said just you're not supposed to jump from there.

672
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,040
There's nowhere else to be.

673
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,480
I can't get up on these wee things here.

674
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,440
Turn around and fly in whole.

675
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,880
Fly in whole.

676
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,000
That wooden door.

677
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,560
It's really hard, but you have to keep trying on the edge.

678
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,280
Stop at the stairs, turn around, then fly into a hole.

679
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,400
But hole.

680
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,400
But you're supposed to be the smart one.

681
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,480
I only have three brain cells and they're fighting for fourth place.

682
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,280
Try finger.

683
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,120
I do remember never beating this game because I was too frustrated and I did beat two and three.

684
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,760
Stone stairs of it back.

685
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,080
Okay.

686
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,880
Oh, you fucking twat.

687
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
Right, stone stairs and then fly into butthole.

688
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,240
Stone stairs and fly into butthole.

689
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,360
Is it from that ledge I'm supposed to do it?

690
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,320
Is it that?

691
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,840
Is it honestly that one?

692
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:07,200
Oh, I'm not losing it.

693
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,760
I'm actually losing it and I fucking get skin corn.

694
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,960
Oh my god, that's so evil from the dead team.

695
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,360
So is.

696
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:19,840
Oh, right.

697
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,160
Okay.

698
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,480
Okay.

699
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,360
And then I just take a really short left.

700
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,680
Oh, for goodness sake.

701
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:27,920
Offer.

702
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,080
Bro, why did you guys let me do that for so long?

703
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,880
I'm embarrassing myself here.

704
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,840
That literally took a millisecond.

705
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,400
You let me struggle for how long?

706
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,000
Pass it.

707
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:48,560
Bend over.

708
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,600
You're all getting spanked.

709
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,520
You let me struggle for who?

710
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,080
We'll grab the key but we aren't really gonna.

711
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,160
Golf clap.

712
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,800
Good job.

713
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,080
Right, we got four dragons.

714
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,160
I don't know that was the solution but at your third try,

715
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,520
the lesson is that maybe that's not a solution yet.

716
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,960
I think I'll go with that as well.

717
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,800
But it looked like I was so close.

718
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,040
I mean, they probably did that for a reason.

719
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:18,720
Uh, right.

720
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,040
We're just looking for a portal.

721
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,280
Oh, they're scared of me.

722
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,560
Yeah, you should be actually.

723
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,600
Right, that's where I came in.

724
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,600
Oh, I never even unlocked you.

725
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,000
Sorry.

726
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,160
Hi, Magnus.

727
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,120
Yeah, please burn the tents.

728
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,880
Oh, we're pillaging now?

729
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,440
Oh dear.

730
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,040
Thanks again, Lord of Storms for the gifted memberships.

731
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,160
I appreciate it.

732
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,440
And then I get to see my moats.

733
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,880
I'm waiting for the next moat update as I just coughed there.

734
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
I should be coming in soon.

735
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,160
I think up next is Mercy the Moats.

736
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,560
Or is it Sheebie?

737
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,560
It's either Sheebie, Mercy, Azura, or Mercy, Sheebie, Azura, and then me last.

738
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,840
But that's because we can be patient for a moat.

739
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,440
I want the girls to have theirs first.

740
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,680
This isn't Elden Ring.

741
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,760
You probably can't just bash your head into a wall over and get into a works.

742
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,160
Well, that's why I normally spawn you guys in at that point.

743
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,040
Although I've been cheating from the start.

744
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,280
Like, I know I was supposed to use a, like, explore the DLC on my own,

745
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,760
but I just like playing games with you.

746
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,600
Like, I like when you hold my hand through stuff.

747
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,080
Like, I had so much fun playing the Jellybean game.

748
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,960
I was so excited.

749
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,760
I was like, listen...

750
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,560
Oh, sorry.

751
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,720
I like listen to some of the thing and you can hear the excitement in my voice

752
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,760
because my voice was, like, so light-pitched the entire stream

753
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,280
because I was just so happy playing.

754
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,840
So with you, I was like, oh, I don't really...

755
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,080
I was, like, up here, like, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

756
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,200
Instead of, like, my...

757
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,520
Usually, like, down here, generic talking.

758
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:56,720
Um...

759
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,240
Oh, I got snowball fight going on.

760
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,200
Okay, first dragon.

761
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:03,840
Oh!

762
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,120
There is a bat.

763
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,560
I think it just took my health.

764
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,080
I like how Micev indulges thanks to the same creatives

765
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,200
being commissioned first.

766
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,080
Mmm.

767
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,560
Well, the ACs are most actually a little bit different

768
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,240
than what we commissioned the first time.

769
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,920
But she was just super happy to get them.

770
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,360
And I was like, well, she's not complaining.

771
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,480
It means less work for me.

772
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,600
So I'll just accept them, which is terrible,

773
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,080
but, oh, I have to admit, I'm a bit tired

774
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,200
of doing, like, in the background work.

775
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,880
I think it's terrible.

776
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,440
Like, I love what I do, and I'm so lucky that I get to do it.

777
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,000
But, oh, I can't wait for, like, all the most order type things.

778
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Thank you, CRC Error, for the membership.

779
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,120
It's really cute.

780
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,000
And...

781
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,360
Kendra?

782
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,480
The very VTuber?

783
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,560
Hello!

784
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,320
Thank you for redirecting into me.

785
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,320
We're just playing Spyro,

786
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,560
which is a childhood game of everyone,

787
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,240
but me, I've never played it before.

788
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,080
And I'm struggling a little bit,

789
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,280
and it's a bit cringe,

790
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,200
but it's still a kid's game,

791
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,960
so there's hope that I can complete it.

792
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,960
Um, hello!

793
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,800
I am Strony Culls from

794
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,480
Availers, Gen 1, and Dolls.

795
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,480
And that's pretty much it.

796
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,760
I'm wildly inappropriate,

797
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,040
so if you don't like that, please,

798
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,640
do not ever feel forced to watch me.

799
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,600
We're just playing Spy...

800
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,720
This is a dead end?

801
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,280
Oh, no.

802
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,560
Um, we're just collecting all the dragons.

803
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,840
We're not doing all the gems,

804
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,760
but this is Spyro 1 Remake.

805
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:48,800
Um...

806
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
We're just getting all our new dragons

807
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,280
and doing it right now.

808
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,200
What?

809
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,160
Thank you for releasing me!

810
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,120
Hello!

811
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,080
Okay, no more tutorial information.

812
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,280
That's interesting.

813
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,440
But yeah, we unlocked the little dragons

814
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,280
by touching the green statue.

815
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,000
Huge.

816
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,280
You've got the camera angle on that.

817
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,640
I'm struggling a wee bit,

818
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,680
but that angle stopped me.

819
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,720
No, it didn't.

820
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,400
Am I doing it justice?

821
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm glad.

822
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,720
I feel like I'm so low energy today,

823
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,880
but I was very ill yesterday.

824
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:41,600
Oh my god.

825
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,920
That taxi driver was trying to take me out.

826
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:46,880
I swear he's like,

827
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,320
now I'm gonna fuck you up.

828
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,080
Thank you so much for the tip, Anonymous.

829
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,360
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

830
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,040
I feel a bit, um...

831
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,040
Insecure's a bit of a dramatic word,

832
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,320
like fucking relax.

833
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,600
But like, I feel a bit like,

834
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,440
oh no, I'm not really doing that well.

835
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:02,640
Um...

836
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,280
This game is perfect for a chill stream.

837
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,840
You're doing great.

838
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,800
I'm loving the dance.

839
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,760
Oh, thank you.

840
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,320
You're in a little ego boost, right?

841
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,360
I don't know where they're at.

842
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:13,840
Thank you.

843
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,320
Oh, how much they went right past the...

844
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,880
Is it there?

845
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,920
Or is it just saying that there's a shining gem there?

846
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,040
Okay, I think we're gonna have to backtrack

847
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,960
to try and find this other dragon.

848
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,520
And yes, I'm seeing dragon on purpose like that now,

849
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,800
because you guys are a billion, though.

850
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,120
Oh, it's okay.

851
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,320
You're probably doing better than me.

852
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,640
Uh...

853
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,280
The music's cute,

854
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,640
but not cute enough for Gen 2's background music

855
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,240
to be themed off of all.

856
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,800
I'm gonna see if I can be cheeky and get,

857
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:56,800
maybe,

858
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,280
Minish Cap.

859
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,600
I do like Minish Cap.

860
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,480
I really do.

861
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,080
Right, that's a ledge to jump over

862
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,120
if I've ever seen one.

863
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,240
Can I climb up somewhere?

864
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,560
I can.

865
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,200
Okay, I think it must be this ledge then.

866
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,720
Yeah, come on.

867
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,880
Nope, it's not.

868
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,080
All right, we're downflyed too.

869
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,760
Come on, give it to me straight.

870
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,960
Ah, I don't have the key for that.

871
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,840
Crash Bandicoot, twin sanity background music.

872
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,720
Yeah, I remember you beating the final boss like a real pro.

873
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,360
What?

874
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,360
Conk, conk, conk.

875
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:49,200
I'm searching, I'm looking.

876
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:52,560
What?

877
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,280
I don't...

878
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,360
Go away, please.

879
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:02,000
Is he gonna get me?

880
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,240
No.

881
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,000
I was like,

882
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,480
is the height difference about to enroll me?

883
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,160
Wait, I'm all the way back at the start.

884
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,000
Huh?

885
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,800
Where's this flipping dragon?

886
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:15,840
I never noticed that.

887
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,640
Is it like hiding?

888
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,960
Last dragon is hella hard to find.

889
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,040
Clearly, I've freaking gone past the dum-dum.

890
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,800
Is he like under a hidden thing?

891
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,280
Like, you gotta do a U-turn to get to it and fly down.

892
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,040
Mr. Bat, please.

893
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,000
Okay, he's gonna heal up Spark.

894
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:37,760
Is he here?

895
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,400
Oh, this is a bedding.

896
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,600
You have a mini map on the lower left screen.

897
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,160
Oh, I forgot about that.

898
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,280
Oh, you mean that big thing that really helps out

899
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,520
to tell you where like hidden locations and stuff is?

900
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,080
Okay, it looks like...

901
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:58,560
I...

902
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,760
Whoa, don't do that.

903
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,560
That was a very nice...

904
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,600
Okay, it looks...

905
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,200
This is just a platform for the sake of being a platform.

906
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,920
Oh, my sister go down there to get the denki.

907
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,600
So then what was the bed on that?

908
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,600
Something over here?

909
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,760
Wait, where did we dot something on?

910
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,800
Hmm, okay.

911
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,440
So there's like a weird U-turn in here?

912
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,760
Wow, that's so tall.

913
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,240
And I'm so tiny.

914
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,760
What's the lives up there as well?

915
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,960
Hold on, right, must be something back here.

916
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,720
Yeah, but qua, you're welcome.

917
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,080
To say you are welcome in French, you say?

918
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,080
Oh, this one's lured and the other one's.

919
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,080
Oh, my God, I'm so smart.

920
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:04,880
Are you squinting?

921
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,520
I'm so smart.

922
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,560
E-e-e-e-ego.

923
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,520
I just hear...

924
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,560
Do you want me to say it with a harsh Scottish accent then?

925
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,120
Dragon, is that what you want me to refer to all of them as dragon?

926
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,240
Oh look at my dragonfly of a health bar.

01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:06,860
Ok, we have just committed a not very nice thing.

933
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,540
Oh, he's posing on me.

934
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:13,920
He's starting on me.

935
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,440

942
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,200

01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:52,400
Do not touch whatever the purple stuff is. I don't know what it is. I don't want to know

995
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,680
Ah, okay cliff time we did

Got the cameras a bit unfree. That's where I got him. I get motion sick playing this game

999
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,800
I did not get motion sick playing games, but that's where I came from

1000
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,280
Oh, it's a life. Just beat you

Only when I feel better that way am I going crazy?

1007
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,080
I don't go past the balloon guy and he was gonna take me somewhere near

1008
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,880
Go

1009
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,360
Bun bun you heal up my little

1010
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:26,960
Don't the balloon guy here, and he was gonna take me away

1011
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:35,600
Hmm what a weird stone it has a target right on there and there's a cannon nearby

1012
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,600
I

1013
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,920
Can in your bag stall

1014
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,320
No, I can act can't push these I don't think so

1015
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,840
I can't I'm just gonna burn all the cannons

1016
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:09,520
Hold on cannon cannon cannon. How are you supposed to figure any of this out?

1017
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,200
Target I see the target I push it over

1018
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,240
No, I can't offer goodness sake

1019
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,200
Okay

1020
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:37,320
Okay, okay, okay, not bad. Thank you for the hand. We got there in the end

1021
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,520
It really gave me time to react to that

1022
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:50,840
Good job job story is so clever. Yeah thought about all myself. Thank you

1023
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,720
Keep up the good work, and I know you'll fulfill your oh

1024
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:06,000
Hey strongy think you could teach us some Scottish Gaelic

1025
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,680
I have a goal of learning new languages

1026
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:16,400
I am so sorry, but I come from the mainland of Scotland, and I was not taught gaelic at all

1027
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,640
aim

1028
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:24,480
So I'm sorry to disappoint gaelic lover, but actually I can't teach it because I was never taught it myself

1029
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,640
The only words I know are polis

1030
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,480
aim

1031
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Oh

1032
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,720
Police is polis and Scotland is Alba. Those are the only words. I know okay. How'd I get over here?

1033
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:44,400
I still keep the dragon, right? Okay, if I keep the dragon. Oh, no, don't

1034
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,920
What I need the balloon I

1035
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,800
Can't believe I did that honestly

1036
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:59,640
Only I would manage that. Okay, we're doing it. No, we're not we're not doing the night flight. We ain't doing any flights

1037
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,240
Oh, sorry

1038
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,960
That's where the whole other is the hot air balloon guy

1039
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:11,280
Okay, take this I can't believe how fast you found so much stolen

1040
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:18,960
Yeah, magic crafters I'm surprised you don't know any ranchy words in

1041
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,160
Gaelic or Gaelic lover and

1042
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,960
No one spoke it I come from the mainland of Scotland and now if you come from the islands up north or way up north

1043
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,480
You're most likely to be taught it. So you're just talking an accent

1044
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,680
Like a regional accent I and

1045
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:46,800
Slang but like Scott slang but not Gaelic not Scott's Gaelic and I was never taught that they

1046
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,480
So folk are actually wanting to be taught it so it doesn't

1047
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,280
Juice I can't even see I'm around these damn corners. Oh, I can't jump

1048
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,800
I'll

1049
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,480
You

1050
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:12,200
It's pronounced Alba and Gaelic Alba spell ELB

1051
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,040
Oh, I love us. I

1052
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,800
Love oh my god. No shit. There's that's one stop. Is it bad here?

1053
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,440
Rescue the egg

1054
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,440
I

1055
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,400
Got walled

1056
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,880
Wow, wow, wow, wow

1057
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:45,320
Oh, it's with Shadow Wizard money games we love casting spells at the Alpine Ridge

1058
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,720
You need to chase him in the other direction

1059
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:02,040
And you teach Sunday in Scots so that we can flirt with the nice lassie on vacation

1060
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:07,080
There's really not any nice Scottish slang that I can think of

1061
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,880
and

1062
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,000
If she's pregnant you see oh, she's up the Duff which is just

1063
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,760
It's not that pleasant of a terminology

1064
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,840
I guess technically if you want to ask a Scottish chick, do you want to be pregnant by me?

1065
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,840
You'd be like odd you want to be up the Duff?

1066
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:29,960
Or like I'll get you up the Duff. Oh, yeah up the Duff. I'm not even kidding

1067
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
The fire back

1068
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,480
Sorry, hold on. Okay. Well, if he's not gonna get me then he's not gonna get me

1069
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,840
He can raid him

1070
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:59,720
Isn't the Duff also fine for the but and Scots it just means pregnant like oh, she's up the Duff

1071
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,160
But normally it's like a disapproving

1072
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,120
taper

1073
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,360
Is that them going out?

1074
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,240
Plop plop plop get up the Duff basically if I did like a Scottish

1075
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,040
Or do I'd be like get me up the Duff get me up the Duff

1076
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,000
It just doesn't say it's not very pleasant terminology though

1077
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,760
No

1078
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,880
Get off the Duff get off the Duff get off the Duff get off the Duff

1079
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,120
Thank you Raven

1080
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:38,160
It's get up up up up to get off the Duff isn't a thing has to be up

1081
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,240
Oh

1082
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,400
Get it in the river

1083
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Mustn't be

1084
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,320
Mustn't be a dead-on kind of you

1085
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,320
You still make dragonfly

1086
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,720
Huh

1087
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,600
I

1088
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,520
Like I said, huh?

1089
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,720
Dragon crazy

1090
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,520
Yeah, I didn't know what the game wanted me for there

1091
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:37,440
Maybe someone doesn't want to get go. Oh my bad. I was thinking about the Chuff not Duff

1092
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,720
Huh

1093
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,680
Come on

1094
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,400
That's such a distance though

1095
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,560
No buzz

1096
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,560
Oh

1097
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,160
Can't yell

1098
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,920
No, it doesn't need to give me more money as I was saying plop plop plop plop

1099
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,960
Get up the Duff get up the Duff this get up the Duff

1100
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,360
Thank you again Raven and it's it and ask me to get out the

1101
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:29,720
There will be no birthing of the lot the only thing on birth in his gen 2 maybe gen 3

1102
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,520
And then that's that's all the birthing. Oh, this is any more. I'm supposed to go

1103
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:42,160
I'm not supposed to over there. I'm stuck over here now. Can he be?

1104
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,000
A Spyro up the Duff. Spyro is not pregnant. He just has a little belly

1105
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,880
Oh

1106
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:01,520
This Leo is really confusing me. I'm confuzzled

1107
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:11,840
Looks like I'm supposed to do something to open that platform type thing, but I've not done it so I keep perishing

1108
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,560
I'm like on my own over here

1109
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:25,120
Is there like a secret? Does this game have secret walls?

1110
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,800
You should pass the lead

1111
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:40,440
There also may be a way to catch the egg guy that escaped earlier as a person that has 100% at this game

1112
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:44,720
multiple times both in childhood and after the remake watching this has given me a small panic attack

1113
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,720
Why am I doing everything the wrong way?

1114
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,800
The Geomancers are supposed to open it, but I don't recall where he is

1115
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,920
So I've basically progressed on the side of the map. I'm not supposed to I

1116
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,320
Like when Scots type funny and complain about things on to our baby coughing on our bus right as I needed to

1117
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:09,360
Cough so I nearly exploded hold on in because I didn't want to look like someone who copies babies

1118
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:14,840
Oh my god, my favorite one is I want to wrap myself up in tin foil and blow myself up to fuck

1119
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,240
Okay, yeah, something's supposed to open this

1120
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:27,960
Is it that twat back there? There might be hold on let me perish need reset

1121
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:34,920
Honestly, if you type it in it's like want to wrap myself up in tin foil and blow myself up to fucking the microwave

1122
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,360
It's the funniest thing. I'm fucking red. I love it so much

1123
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,720
That's why I sometimes go like, oh, I want to blow myself up, but it's because of that tin foil tweet

1124
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:49,720
Is it that? Is that why that ledge didn't open?

1125
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:59,040
How confusing I might have to do a different mission

1126
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:04,840
I'm not sure what the game wants of me. Yeah, all those guys have just spawned back in as well

1127
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:10,960
I'm not supposed to get every single one and that's the the deal

1128
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:21,920
So what I take a left destroy them all left side, and then it should open up wherever I'm missing

1129
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,160
Get one oh he's too big

1130
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,840
That was a bit cheap

1131
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:43,120
Okay, no

1132
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,440
And then what defeat this guy that's everything in the area defeated

1133
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,680
I'm being trolled of this platform doesn't come down right I'm being trolled

1134
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,760
I may have to quit this one. I don't know what I'm supposed to do

1135
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,040
The game is tied to frames per second

1136
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:14,480
I always interest and see how others play this game. You need to collect all the wee orbs

1137
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,200
I need to be 30 frames per second

1138
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,760
Is that real

1139
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:35,360
Oh my god, it's so bitty. What oh my god, it's so bitty though

1140
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,840
Oh

1141
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,320
My god, oh

1142
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,680
This looks awful though

1143
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,920
And I put it back on

1144
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,640
My ring cloud, thank you for the redirect

1145
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,920
We're currently

1146
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,520
playing

1147
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,240
Spiral which is a childhood game of not me, but of you guys

1148
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,480
and

1149
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:12,360
I'm currently getting wrecked by Framerate. Oh, I can't a

1150
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,200
For goodness sake. No, don't look close your eyes. Don't look at this embarrassment

1151
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
site

1152
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,480
Side chick kisses for you. I'm strongy calls from be a lure

1153
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,680
I actually had the opportunity to play with rain cloud on and a moongers club

1154
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,320
And

1155
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:39,520
Might recognize the Scottish voice if not, it's perfect to find I'm strongy calls from be a lures gen one

1156
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,400
And today indulges in journey. I'm so rubbish at this stuff

1157
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,240
and and and and and and and then

1158
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:57,240
And being close awesome, thank you. I thought you were Mexican motherfucker

1159
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,240
Oh

01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,920
Oh, it's me. Oh, where is the loo the wagons?

1161
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,920
Don't it's the ugly

1162
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,400
Hope stream is fine. Yes. Hope you had a fun stream too

1163
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:21,440
Okay, I'm a health out. Oh, I'm in trouble. I don't know where the other guy is but

1164
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:26,200
Can you eat the butterfly that came from that sheet or did there no have bar?

1165
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,320
Oh, there's a butterfly. Go eat it. Look. I see it. It's like jumping up and down. It's fluttering get it

1166
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:35,160
Fuck it up. Fuck it up. Tear it up. Oh, no, you're fine. You're so dramatic

1167
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,800
Ugui is a turtle no dragon. Go on the S. The Lou dragon

1168
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:55,160
This just for gems down here like it makes the Constraini stream

1169
01:24:56,200 --> 01:25:00,800
I don't speak any of the lingo though. I'd be doing a prey

1170
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:09,000
You got absolutely wrecked. I mean, yeah, you just ever take that. Oh speaking of being right

1171
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,960
Boy Strony

Thank you. Thank you, do you fling you understand?

01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,480
Latina for Gentoo. I'm very curious to see how

1176
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,680
Wait, is that all the dragons? No, I've missed one dress

1177
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,960
Don't put me back out there

1178
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,760
Where it must be on this side

1179
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:54,920
Oh

1180
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,800
See something. Oh, wait. No, I came from there

1181
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:08,060
Fear the chancla should I get well get a milflatina and her gimmick is she can throw a chancla that would be our custom toggle

1182
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,200
Right, there's definitely something over here. Oh shit. Was that supposed to do what I think I was supposed to do and

1183
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:20,840
Fly from all the way up there over there. I think so. Oh, there's a ledge

1184
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,840
It's a ledge now. Don't be fooled by the layout of this game. There's a lot of ledges

1185
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,800
That kind of just pop it nowhere. Okay, let's try that again

1186
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:38,200
Okay, easy peasy. Let me squeeze it. That was exactly what I was supposed to do. I was like a guy

1187
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,240
Chancles are heat seeking

1188
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:56,040
Oh my god, it's fire. You're actually so brave. I'm not wait, what do you mean?

1189
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:03,080
Come on hitbox

1190
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,400
You say I have to chase them around

1191
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,800
I

1192
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,240
If he's already taking off I'm not even near you mate

1193
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,880
I'm running I'm running. I'm cutting corners. I'm cutting

1194
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:33,880
Wow, I think I'm getting closer

1195
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,000
I think I just got a ton far away because of that jump

1196
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,480
Should I jump off this ledge instead? Oh

1197
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,320
Maybe no, I don't know. I feel like he's getting further away from me and I'm didn't even well, maybe

1198
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,880
No, he's like gaining a speed buff

1199
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,880
Holy moly

1200
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,360
Right, we did it quit the current game

1201
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:14,040
You mean level

1202
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,480
You mean quit the current level

1203
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:22,000
Don't forget to like the stream reefless. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so bad at saying that

Does it do that thing? I don't know if you remember

1216
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:25,760
YouTube released an update so if the streamer or the in the video they say like hit that like button the like button

1217
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,240
Lights up on your phone. I don't know if that's a solid thing or not

1218
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:35,800
When you say smash that but smash that like button the button actually goes up because of speech recognition

1219
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:45,240
Oh, thank you veiler lover, I've got a few tactics up my naughty sleeve, but that's in three weeks

Mom, what are you doing with mr. Mine?

1236
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,560
Why does it? Why is mr. Mine dressed like that mom?

What was that supposed to happen

1259
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:33,600
Where are you going? Are you just hating in the cavern for me?

1260

Oh you too fast

1274
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,260

01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:29,820
Oh

01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:33,340
Okay

01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,460
This is a respond I think

1283
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,340
I

1284
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:13,540
Fight in each other

1285
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:19,220
You stop that

1286
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:22,380
Okay, we've got a second

1287
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,300
I've heard that and he has the means can help

1288
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:28,340
Oh, I'm just wrong

1289
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:31,340
Burn them all

1290
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,980
He had a subway and you tell me doesn't feel good

1291
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:42,300
Right what do you guys do you do a big old cross jump

1292
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:46,180
praying

1293
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:51,420
Yeah, I'm so sorry. I was like literally throwing up burping everything yesterday

1294
01:36:52,140 --> 01:37:00,260
Nothing came up. Thankfully, but I did have like the gags and I'm afraid I have not fully recovered from my tragic I

1295
01:37:01,980 --> 01:37:05,860
Wasn't supposed to do that or did I just miss by a millisecond?

1296
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:14,580
One of the levels in this world has a song that eventually used as credit themes in the Amanda show this

1297
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:18,580
Okay, I just missed I

1298
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:21,180
I

1299
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:31,420
Didn't commit and then because I didn't commit I died

1300
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:35,420
I just thought I should tell you that no, please always hundred percent commit

1301
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:38,940
Because I just freaking perished over nothing

1302
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,900
So I'm done

1303
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:42,900
And got scared, okay

1304
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,540
Commit

1305
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:51,580
I'm going to commit suicide wait, is this got the wagon on it? No

1306
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:59,220
I'm sorry, it seems a lot harder than I first thought wait, so the dragon isn't there. Oh

1307
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:04,920
My god, look at my terrible percentages on like everything

1308
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:11,180
Is it this is it?

1309
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:14,140
Where's the dead end?

1310
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:17,100
Other than drills, I guess

1311
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,380
And part in the earth bender

1312
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,740
Yeah, the world basis says hope you mastered gliding

1313
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:35,740
What a great audience

1314
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:42,060
I don't know what to think eps drone it is because I feel so sick

1315
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:45,620
I'm gonna have to change up what I thought my schedule was

1316
01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:48,340
and

1317
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:53,220
Don't know what to change it to but you'd be nice to myself. I'm probably just gonna end up

1318
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,300
chilling

1319
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:01,020
Oh, I feel sick. I'm so sorry. It's just come on again that

1320
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:05,700
Sorry, I keep doing that. That's the only thing I don't like about

1321
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:11,540
Well, not that someone with like motion sickness, but

1322
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:19,220
I'm sorry. I'm completely losing. I'm losing my flow. Okay. I'm losing my flow

1323
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:31,260
Astronauts, you need a break. Yeah, I think this is actually going for my motion sickness

1324
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:34,020
Which is I just saw that in the corner of my

1325
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:37,060
Is she be coming up?

1326
01:39:37,140 --> 01:39:39,140
Feel ill

1327
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:47,180
Who knew my biggest weakness would be fucking automobile and auto bang, but I'm gonna drink some more

1328
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,780
22 minutes. Okay. Well, we do some marshmallows and memem. I

1329
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:58,220
Don't think she's on today red question mark

1330
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:01,900
How about I go to oh my god

1331
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:08,100
I'm sorry. I'm just covering up the game screen right now. I cannot look at that anymore

1332
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:14,820
That's it's a really really really annoying thing about and

1333
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:22,580
What all my membership streams from yesterday all got limited ads

1334
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,860
What did I even say anything that was that bad?

1335
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:29,780
All four of my streams yesterday got limited ads

1336
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:37,140
Do you want to come over and have a bite? I made cottage pie for the first time. Oh, that's amazing

1337
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:40,900
You made British food. Is it all brown just like all the British food in the world?

1338
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:46,520
Amy's actually live for sonic heroes unbelievable

1339
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:56,700
Okay, let me just make sure that she be definitely isn't coming up and if she's not I'm so sorry. I'll check out

1340
01:40:58,620 --> 01:41:00,620
I'll check out

1341
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:03,620
What will I check out?

1342
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:12,260
She's doing smash or pass tomorrow with Toma. Yeah, she's not on

1343
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:16,340
Hades break. Okay. Okay. I see it

1344
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:23,660
What are you gonna do after stream probably go back to sleep I feel I still feel real

1345
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:28,660
And it was it wasn't even the most intense car ride, but

1346
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,980
I've only had five hours sleep. No nap and

1347
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,100
Yeah

1348
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:40,500
I'm a poor being. What can I say? No way Amy just went offline. Did you?

1349
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:43,140
Say that coming

1350
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:48,460
Amy at you may plus. Yeah. Oh wait. I'm saying it wrong. It's I

1351
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:53,260
Did she literally just go flying am I going crazy?

1352
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:55,260
I

1353
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:58,740
Streamed a day ago stream 14 hours ago. Oh, she's coming on. I'll live in

1354
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:12,900
Miss Mars playing Pokemon run a redirect into miss model think oh

1355
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:19,980
Hugs and forehead kisses. Hi. I'm so sorry, but bye. I'm about to go

1356
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:24,380
Don't feel very well. I'll open up marshmallow. Just to see if I can

1357
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,940
questions and that

1358
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:32,500
Actually, there's been a bit delay on the patreon audios. The girls should have their first one out, but

1359
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:38,340
We'll get to it. Hi, scrawny. I love you. Don't feel better than I hopefully will feel better by tomorrow

1360
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:40,340
I think I'll be okay

1361
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,380
Thank you little refund

1362
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:45,140
Yeah, better. Have a good sleep. Yes, definitely

1363
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:52,220
If you want a short chill game for next week, maybe look at what remains of Edith Finch

1364
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:56,220
Curious, I don't think I've heard that or seen gameplay of that game

1365
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:00,420
Stony, thank you for making my tentacles so happy. Oh, yeah

1366
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:03,660
Be a little accomplished great things. I'm not

1367
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:09,220
Glad we could break your tentacle

1368
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:12,660
Pat pat pat get Wilson. Thank you

1369
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:18,420
First and foremost, it's a pleasure to finally meet our father-in-law. Let me introduce

1370
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:24,620
Ourselves. We are the reeflings. Let me tell you that your daughter is the most amazing. Alright, I'll give it to my dad

1371
01:43:24,620 --> 01:43:28,020
Sorry, I won't read out if it's not for me. It's for my dad

1372
01:43:31,460 --> 01:43:37,860
Squids can't extend their tentacles to 20 to 40 ms, which is about 10 times faster than they blink

1373
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:40,180
They are really impressive since they don't use any

1374
01:43:40,940 --> 01:43:48,340
Spring like mechanism. They only use their powerful muscles for this which can rear be rearranged in a crisscross pattern

1375
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:54,820
I don't know that imagine a tiny reefling growing a 30-foot tentacle and striking out with it at lightning speeds to defend

1376
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:58,060
Mummy in danger. That was so wholesome. You could have gone somewhere else with that

1377
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:01,180
so

1378
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,180
Um

1379
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:11,260
Normally she be streams and she be doesn't have a public stream today. No, it's okay. Don't worry. Is she doing a member stream today?

1380
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,380
you

1381
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:23,380
I'm so sorry. I think I'm gonna have to call it there. I really don't feel well

1382
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:26,700
I promise I'd stream longer if I could but I

1383
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:32,660
Think I'm ready to throw up and I think I'm doing a mercy modest in the duck again

1384
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:37,820
My stomach does not feel right. I'm so sorry. I'm gonna redirect into this lovely girl

1385
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:43,700
I'll say hi for like a millisecond, but I need to go light and I'm so sorry reeflings. I apologize

1386
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:49,260
But we did we give spiral a little bash. Thank you so much for watching me stumble through this game

1387
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:56,100
It's very cute. I like it. I'll see you tomorrow. I don't know what the plan the action is tomorrow

1388
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:59,340
I think the new schedule starts up, but I need to change that way

1389
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:04,100
But thank you so so much and I'll see you goofy go bers tomorrow. Say hi to a

1390
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:07,300
For me, okay. Bye. I'm so sorry
