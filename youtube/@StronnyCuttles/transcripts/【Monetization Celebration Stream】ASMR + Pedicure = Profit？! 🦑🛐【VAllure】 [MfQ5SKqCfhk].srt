00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,420
There's a few tools I got that are like require real ambidextory, but like

Crackpipes, couple of shit

Hold on, hold on, I can do this

40
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:14,780
I'm actually having a problem with this tool, by the way, I don't know what the lady did, but I think it's contracted and I might have to go with the doctor about it

41
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,660
Cause something's not right, um, I cleaned the wound today

42

Oh wait, hold on

44
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,220

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,940
Oh, come on, I'm just not turning over because of the way my feet are

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,980
Oh my, the little tool just cracked

49
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,900
Oh shit, I'm okay, I'm sorry, let me give my design a name

50
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:05,740
That took me so long, I also brought Pop Rocks to proof how sweaty my feet are, I want to see if my feet sweat can make them pop

51
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
Although just the feet sweat, nothing else

52
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,380
I just realized I'm really covering that up, so I'm gonna go over here

53
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,020
I don't know, look, it's my feet

54
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,060
Oh yeah, I also have a PC cleaner

55
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,660
These are used for fan board type things, but you need to like, squeeze them to get the air out

56
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,500
So yeah, I brought a lot of tools to try and get rid of my freaking feet

57
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,060
But I also got the frog thing, and it goes like

58
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,060
Like

59
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,380
Yeah, it's into the frog

60
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Hey, I'm working that one, hold on

61
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:03,820
Okay, I'll try and say more names. I'm so sorry. I I'm very flustered when it comes to these kinds of streams

62
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,380
I feel a little pressured like

63
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,100
Oh yeah, listen to that frog. How are you so good with your feet? I don't know, how are you not so good with your feet?

64
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm trying not to knock over the webcam

65
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,580
We'll do this, we'll try and say some names, okay

66
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700

Okay, that was what was done offline. Now what was done right now

It's freaking impossible to keep up with but I'm gonna try my best, doesn't mean I can't try

73
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,700
Okay, I'm gonna try and keep up. Please bear with me. AC's in the room, bear with me. Okay

74
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,900
Could you wet? What?

75
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,820
Could you? Man, I wish I had little feet. Could you wet feet drying my?

76
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,140
Well, I bought pop rocks to see if I can actually get them to pop with my feet sweat alone, which is pretty gross

77
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,220
But I thought it was really funny. Um

78
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,260

95
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:53,420
Congrats on monetization. Thank you so much. I'm so sorry. I'm like really out of my element with these kind of streams

96
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
I'm not used to like

97
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,140
I don't know. I'm just used to

98
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,780
Hopefully I can at least do some actual ASMR movement. I'm so sorry. I'm trying to catch up for a little

But thank you so much for your support. You did it. Can you please scare him like that?

117
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,300
I was gonna do a fake cam on buckshot really

118
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,420
I don't know if I have to go to a doctor about my toe because something is wrong with it and I'm not

119
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I don't know what on earth is going on

120
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,300
Oh, she did so on this toe

121
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,620
This bit here she cut into like really deep and I was like, oh no, it's fine

122
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,100
Like accidents happen. It was a little bit painful, but I didn't think anything of it

123
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,420
And then it's actually pretty sore today. So I don't know if I have to get it checked out

124
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,900
But yeah

125
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:52,380
The only good thing with your toe is it's not the only thing wrong with your toes. It's not my max. Oh my goodness. Okay

126
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,420
Oh

Grandpa thank you for coming to me

129
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,540
Yes, you're not supposed to cut it at all. A lot of shops do it anyway. Yeah

130
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,700
I think I may have got hurt a little bit, but it's okay. Uh, turi. Thank you

131
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,140
All right, well, let's see if we can open up pop rocks with their feet and get my feet sweat to activate the pop rocks

132
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,780
This might be very loud actually. Hold on. I'm gonna take it a little bit away from you. Okay

133
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,300
I don't know if I can do it with my feet to rip open

134
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,580
Anything is possible if you get your main stairs, right? So we have the

135
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:48,860
Gripper repair funds for 10. Thank you so much. Oh, wait, wasn't there a red? Why is it not displaying?

136
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,860
I could have sworn I saw a red earlier

137
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
I'm uh, it was a red

138
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,740
But jingle 100 in celebration your monetization. I gave you my first ever red so far. Thank you

Thank you so much

140
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,180
Do you guys think you better support the girls more than this? That's all I'm saying

141
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,380
Oh, I don't think I can rip it open

142
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,580
Actually having to use my brain power monkey feet go

143
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,540
I can't see if there's like a pre rip section

144
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,940
I can't see anything at all. That's why I've not turned my glasses. Uh, I'm trying to rip open, but it's gonna work

145
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,580
Support the girls

146
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820

Congrats on the monetization. Thank you

It's not what it looks like rain. It's a mistake. Okay

153
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
Hi rain

154
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,580
It reluctantly saying thank you for the 10. Did you want to put down a towel first last?

155
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,460
Nah, it's fine

156
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,860
the

157
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,620
The place I am renting the car kits weren't even cleaned before I moved in so

158
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,740
You get you get what you want back

159
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,380
Thank you, uh, I'll let

160
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,500
999 thank you for becoming a member. Okay, I don't know what I have to choose my hand

161
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,340
Sorry, let's hold on. Oh wait. I'll do it off camera. Watch this. Oh look at my toes go

162
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,060
Oh, oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. My toes weren't in frame. Oh dear. Oh, my toes weren't in frame. Oh, you couldn't see that

163
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
But I did get them open

164
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:00,780
So the way my feet sweat the most is in this section in between the toes. So this is what I'm basically going to aim for

165
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,700
This is disgusting if this actually pops. This is this is awful if this genuinely pops because of my feet sweat

166
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,020
This is terrible

167
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,580
Um, key if the spadey, thank you

168
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,620
If this pops, I'm actually gonna cry

169
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Hopefully it doesn't work. I don't think I need

170
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,540
this one

171
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
Hold on. I need to sit on the floor for this

172
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,020
Oh, I need to do this with my foot

173
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
As if this pops

174
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
I can't hold them in my thorn

175
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,380
Did it pop? No, I don't think I did. I think we're safe

176
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
I think we're safe

177
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
I can't do it

178
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Wait, did it pop? No. Oh

179
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
I hear it. Shut up

180
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,580
Did it pop? It's popping. No, that's so gross

181
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,060
I'm gonna step my feet this way. Hold on. Like

182
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:19,340
It popped. So now you're on the line about that. That's disgusting

183
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,420
But yeah, I got real sweat feet. I also have sweaty hands. Maybe I would do it in my hand

184
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,940
Oh, it's kind of the same thing where it's sweating between my fingers more

185
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:37,820
Salt feet. Well, you want to lick them?

186
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,140
Oh, right. Oh, no, it's getting sticky because my feet are over. I never thought this far ahead

187
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,060
Why am I so low IQ? It's such a curse sometimes. Hold on

188
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,420
Thank you Esteban Lomiel, if you're gonna remember. Thank you

189
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
Uh, Colin

190
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,020
Four, three, one, six, and thank you Shalom Plain

191
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,140
She kind of dumb though. Sticky feet mean sticky floors

192
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,340
Oof

193
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,820
Let me put socks on after this stream. Oh, there's like bits and spots everywhere now

194
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:26,380
You know what? Maybe that reefling was right and I should have put a towel down. Hold on. My sweaty hands are so sticky

195
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,180
They're like it's it's sticking to my hands

196
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Look, it's actually a benefit

197
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,980
It's actually a benefit. Okay. You just have to think of the situation

198
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,780
Hold on. Let me just pop them up there. Our experiment has been conducted

199
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,780
Grows, I know

200
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,180
My ears have a pop rock sometimes. I'm trying to help. Actual squid behaviors

201
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Honestly

202
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,300
Uh, this is welcome to the reefling membership tier and it says message redacted. I don't know how I was like, here you go

203
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,900
Thank you, Breyoko for the

204
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,460
Uh, super chat. Oh my god, super chat because I'm monetized

205
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,420
Found your credit card. Congrats. Uh, maybe don't

206
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,060
You don't have to support by the way. I always have free membership streams all the time

207
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,420
Today we learned to always put damage up right and we're going to actually do ASMR at the same time to hold up

208
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,420
Bull, I also got my skyrim achievements to work. I have like 12 skyrim achievements

209
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,820
I don't know why they weren't displaying but we might be able to actually go back to the skyrim stream at a later time

210
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,980
Boy, thank you for becoming the streamers. Totally bonkers. Congrats on the membership. Thank you

211
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,940
But thank you, boy, for being a member. Thank you

212
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,820
Uh, Sithman's for becoming a member as well

213
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,500
Yeah

214
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Oh, you're getting tangled at the wazoo right now

215
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,500
Next week, yeah, um our endurance stream of the week is reefling

216
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
Hold on. Let me put these on, yeah

217
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,140
Thank you, uh

218
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,540
Shiori for becoming a member and thank you Dr. P for becoming a member. Hold on. This is going to take

219
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,020
some

220
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
manipulation because this ear

221
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,300
Isn't sitting the way ears actually sit

222
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Oh

223
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Um

224
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:03,660
You look on skyrim achievement and usually take like three streams unless your stream's super long. Yeah, I'm a bit of an endurance streamer

225
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
Okay

226
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
ASMR

227
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,340
Thank you, Jay for the membership. Thank you. Oh, woo wee for the membership

228
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Oh no, they're coming off

229
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,980
Hey, just say

230
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:32,060
Wow those feet grew arms and hands out of nowhere. How a unique skill. Look, I'm a cephalopod. I have eight arms. Okay

231
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,180
How do you buy membership? Oh, you don't have to there should be a join button, but it doesn't work everywhere

232
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,220
So don't worry if you can't buy. I always have free streams coming out and the membership streams start

233
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,100
next week

234
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,100
not this week

235
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,100
Because by the end of this week, I'll have everything in place

236
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,500
Workwise so I only have to do shorts and I'm very glad

237
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,260
I am so glad that all the responsibility has taken off me

238
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
And I'm just a normal stromer

239
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
We should have changed all our names into

240
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
Jamal for the stream knowing

241
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,380
More hand you would have said every person

242
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,260
We should have one reflame

243
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,740
It's all arms anyway the logic checks that definitely isn't influenced by the

244
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,860
And the join button is sometimes not next to subscription on mobile

245
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,180
Yeah, I guess if you're in the phone, but don't worry. You don't have to directly support me

246
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,260
I'll always have free streams coming out like all the time. I'm not kidding. You can't

247
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Take me off

248
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,620
Come on

249
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,620
You can't it's not possible

250
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,340
So don't try and take me off

251
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,700
Bless the shimmy. Thank you. We've got everything there. Remember

252
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,060
Are you doing

253
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,740
Me with my dogs are you doing hypnosis soon?

254
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,740
Not right now. No, no of these. I don't think I I don't think anyone can get hypnotized by freaking toes

255
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,900
You can see how opaque my skin is and you can see my blue veins

256
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:16,940
You check them things out. You can literally see them and my little tendons if you look hard enough for them. Yeah. Oh, there they are

257
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Look at them tendons

258
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,500
Thank you for the tip. Oh, hold on string on the swing

259
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,340
Did brian talk right did brian say anything?

260
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
I hope not

261
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,260
Oh, it's kind of working

262
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,580
Okay

263
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:48,540
Stream elements is no kind of working mika's mika's big fan. Thank you for the five gifted memberships

264
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,060
Um, and then boys that trigger were just purple burglar alarm honestly

265
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,180
Brian said it but he was quiet good. I'm glad I didn't say it

266
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:12,780
Uh, bejinga. Oh and celebration. I get my first ever. Yes. I did

267
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,180
I'm so sorry. I'm very scared our brain right now

268
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:26,140
Um secret. Thank you for becoming a member. This is a crazy ASMR concept. It's maybe an ASMR. Let's be honest. I'm just home

269
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,780
I'm just home. See you and

270
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
I'm gonna feel

271
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,860
What

272
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
At their name

273
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,740
At their scrawny, I just want to

274
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,900
I just want to stream what I want and enjoy corpus. You can't do that

275
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,940
You'll never be successful scrawny who my beer makes whole companies of like-minded people to stream with

276
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,060
I cannot tell you how unbelievably

277
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,340
NICE is thank you for that a that type of there any I cannot tell you how unbelievably nice

278
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,980
It's to have like-minded individuals knowing these arrests

279
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:12,300
Like I jumped on my alternative twitter was like listening to the feed. I'm just sitting listening to ac

280
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,740
You know

281
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,980
Tinkle and I'm just like, yeah. Yeah, this is actually quite good quality. Honestly. I wouldn't mind if she brought a 3d one there

282
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,500
It is so nice to have like-minded individuals that are like, yeah, let's provide the goods

283
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:34,140
We say no to blue balling here. Okay. You ask and you receive. Okay. You ask other agencies. You get donor walled

284
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,820
Hold on. I'm gonna take a drink of water. I'm gonna put dehydrate. Please take a drink as well

285
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,820
So

286
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,140
Peeler allegations are yet to be resolved

287
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,220
I will make a public statement about the peeler allegations as you can see we're in very hot water about the peeler

288
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,620
What is donor walled donor walled is when someone

289
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,420
gives a streamer a lot of money via a donation and

290
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,820
the streamer doesn't read it out loud for

291
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,740
Whatever reason it may be they genuinely missed it. That's very plausible

292
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,020
Um, they don't want to acknowledge it because of maybe the contents

293
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,420
Um, but donor walling is the term when someone gives over money and

294
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
Thank you for coming on

295
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,820
Good luck with the pr camp

296
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,380
Okay, i'm me when jen2 comes out the p the pr camp

297
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,420
Peeler the best station in the world

298
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,260
Okay, I genuinely think I managed to catch up to everyone. Thank you so much for like all the love and support

299
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,700
I actually i'm like really overwhelmed right now and I feel so out of my element. I'm like, oh my god. What do I do?

300
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
Can I

301
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
I figured out

302
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,860
Right, so you may notice that my tier two is 4.99

303
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:22,380
I don't think it can be gifted unless on purpose, right? Like can you not just manually put in gift 1.99?

304
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
Internet bazzle

305
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,820
Feeze. Thank you for the member

306
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:35,500
Hold on. I'm like trying so hard to do this. Veeler needs to rehire a peer position a PR position

307
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,980
This is embarrassing I can't grip it. Oh, there we go. Wow surprise surprise if you used to the feet you can grip it really well

308
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:55,260
Hmm. Hmm. Uh, Jeremy. Thank you for coming to man bar. I'm so sorry to anyone. I'm alien right now in this room

309
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,820
I literally this is getting

310
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Come on, please

311
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,020
Okay, here we go. We'll do it like this

312
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,020
What a strike. Thank you for the five gifted members. Did it do it more?

313
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,980
You guys have a look now

314
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,660
Jake Jake said pre lived grippers. Let's go honestly

315
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,980
Oh, there we go. We got it

316
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Oh my god, we got it

317
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,780
The deck's theory

318
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,460
Just admit it

319
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:42,380
Just admit it. No other streamer is even capable of doing this physically because they wouldn't they wouldn't be able to do that

320
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,900
This is absolutely staggering. Did anyone tickle?

321
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,940
Or is everyone just like blown away by this and even being a stream concept?

322
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,060
Do you know how long I've planned this for? I've planned this for

323
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I planned this

324
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,460
Back when I was concepted

325
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,540
To have french tits and nails, which is absolutely awful. I've been waiting months on this idea

326
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,220
To utilize it it manna's up one. Thank you for coming on this one

327
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,300
Oh, right. Can I do two at once? I think I can

328
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
Hold them by the bottom

329
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Oh, we're losing them

330
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:41,260
My feet are so sweaty that they're right. They're up and then oh, they're up a bit too much

331
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,620
I can do this chat. Let me cook

332
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Does that even work?

333
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,260
Oh my ankle just cracked. Did you hear that? Literally dual wielding the tingles right now

334
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,540
We're in on our we're in uncharted territory

335
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,980
Literally. Oh, for goodness sake. Why can I not do it with that one back? I wonder if the uh plaster is actually helping me grip this one

336
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,820
I'm dual wielding tingle. Oh, wait. I think my feet are actually getting too sweaty to pick this up because it's the wire

337
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I

338
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,860
Think I'm literally right. Hold on. We'll just go the brush

339
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,500
Make me thank you for becoming a member. I appreciate you

340
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,660
If this isn't peak streaming, I don't know what honestly like with your

341
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,580
Would yours where the heck is my other oh here?

342
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:00,220
Dual wield brushes from one come on admit it. It's just so hard to do because of the ankle

343
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,700
Oh, there we go. I just need to relax the gripper

344
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
Is the Mars

345
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
I'm impressed

346
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,740
Did you watch the new ankle showcase apparently fable 4 is coming out?

347
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,980
We love joe feet wielding tingles. I bet you do

348
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,580
Wah, thank you for becoming a member. Yay fable

349
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:35,500
But they were saying and apparently the new dragon age origins has like a ton of little g fans really mad because there's something

350
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,500
The

351
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,300
Oh, and my feet are actually too to get into sway

352
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
Hold on

353
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
She's foot maxing on

354
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
No

355
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:09,740
From a 200 build in Skyrim to a dual wield built the next day so talented I knew I knew

356
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,460
Isn't this amazing because look at the gel shine on that big toe

357
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,900
Look at that shine. Oh, that's gorgeous

358
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,420
I

359
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Do

360
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:39,900
Oh my ring late there that's which uh late enough the deck under here because it's all dark

361
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
So that's what the gel polish is doing

362
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,380
Uh delicious brown white food

363
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Thank you for becoming

364
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,380
Not 3d what should have been me

365
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:04,300
Hammerfell is gonna come in 2026 if we're lucky. I'll be so interested to see if I'll enjoy the game or not

366
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,060
I might be one of those games where I have to play offline for the first time

367
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,980
to even appreciate it. I don't know if you ever like

368
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,380
You know your first playthrough of a game you're so silent and so quiet because you're just

369
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,740
Experiencing it for the first time. So I feel like it would be hard to commentate

370
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,020
Like I really want to play big ball these days, but I'm worried

371
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,260
I won't have a thought like a single thought formed because I've never played it before

372
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,180
I'm sad I can't hear but the visuals the visuals though. Yeah, you like the vision

373
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,540
Oh my god, can I do the middle finger on a tool?

374
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,420
And then bring you back up again

375
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,340
And then everyone go down. Oh, no, it's not gonna work. I don't have that kind of

376
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,340
I don't have that kind of tool dexter. You have the cane where I can like grip around and stuff

377
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,660
Yeah

378
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
my appendages

379
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,980
My appendages, I'm actually tempted to leave these on because it's helping to muffle me making any mistakes

380
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,180
Crone

381
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,180
shimmer pants

382
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,020
Thank you for the time. Congrats on monetization, Stony. Thank you. Thank you for the direct support

383
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:24,460
A fan made more remaster of oblivion made in Skyrim's engine is coming out into it with us here

384
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
We do a little tapping ASMR

385
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,260
It sounds like I don't have the dexterity to do the frog thing

386
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,540
If Walsham Gromit aren't becoming Crimes of Beyond on our film. Oh, there's a Walsham Gromit thing coming out

387
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,860
How far can your pinky go? What do you even thought? I'm gonna go like

388
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Sky oblivion

389
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,060
Get Nordic get Nordic get Nordic

390
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:05,340
It's commonly referred to as sky oblivion by the project workers. I mean, wouldn't they not get a season's assist if they're doing that?

391
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,860
Cup your ears. I'm cupping your ears

392
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,420
There's also a mod project that makes all of

393
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Nym

394
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,300
I would love us the moral wind remake would come out, but we were hope

395
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,500
Geez Gromit. I'm sure there's like a new Walsham Gromit thing coming out. I don't know if it's amusing

396
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,380
Because everyone was like, oh new Walsham Gromit before GTA 6

397
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:41,420
No, because it's fantastic fan made mod is free. Ah, so they got away with it

398
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,620
But then that doesn't actually get up a day about more than asset impact

399
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:54,620
Fallout 3 new Vegas thing. What were the accusations that Fallout 4 got the most useless update recently?

400
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:01,500
And it was to spite modders to break them all or something without Fallout 4 or did I make that up?

401
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,980
The amount of complete rework done in Skyrim engine is crazy

402
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
Oh

403
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,580
Daniel or my microphone, by the way, it keeps picking red

404
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,020
but

405
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,460
Yeah, they had more than you'll hope their studio got burned over stuff and all of that way from the Walsham Gromit

406
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,780
I'm playing Fallout 4 right now

407
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:41,020
They update Fallout 4 due to the show and it broke all the mods in the mod. Oh, okay, that makes more sense

408
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:49,340
That makes it good. Okay, it keeps picking red and I'm like, am I am I'm like rippers to okay for this microphone right now?

409
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Hmm

410
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Peter Salas, the voice gromit passed away. Oh, I guess I don't have to get excited

411
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,700
That sounds good, I'm glad

412
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,140
I'm sorry, my ears are fine. My ears are okay

413
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,340
Um, just so you know for the replays, this isn't an endurance stream. I'm

414
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,700
I'm very out of my element with the webcam on and I'm like

415
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,060
Okay, now what?

416
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:34,380
I'm like, okay, but thank you so so much to everyone who's membering thanks to so so much

417
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,260
everyone who's like super Chan or Tiffin or anything like it's such a fantastic help and

418
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,500
um like obviously I don't want to say too much but

419
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,500
You know, it takes a year to create a new generation. So this is very reassuring

420
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,260
Um, if there may or may not be some plans in the background. Ho ho ho

421
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,580
Um, we love mommy. Love you Eastling. Thank you. Seriously. Like I'm a bit overwhelmed

422
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,100
Like I literally have my hands like this because I'm like, oh, okay

423
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:12,780
Um, I was nervous because I don't know what to do. These are what's to say. Genius idea. Please. I was going to do a

424
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:19,820
webcam stream on buckshot relay and then you guys can tell me to put my feet back on the floor because I'll always sit on them

425
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,900
Absolutely there was a gorgeous laugh

426
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,260
Thanks

427
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,700
Yes, I just filled out my element. I'm like, I'm used to meman

428
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,900
I'm used to well, I guess this stream is a big mean to be honest. I don't use to put that much

429
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,140
like

430
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,100
What's the word that much? I did bring

431
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,940
I know everyone is tired of japanese youth cleaning tool and it gets done today

432
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,540
but

433
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,820
it's true

434
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,340
Thank you

435
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:04,940
Tico so well for becoming a member. I can't pick this up. Hold on. All right. Thank you, bernie. You said for becoming a member and thank you

436
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,020
el

437
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
ka

438
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,420
Wow

439
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,380
Sorry, I'm late. No need to be sorry at all. Thank you for becoming a member. Forgiveness sake

440
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,900
When it's really thin, it's so hard to grip

441
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,820
seriously

442
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,140
I feel like I read just like them right around to like bring it closer

443
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,380
And then I need to take this off gently. I can't even do that

444
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,180
That's right. You're cleaning via foot

445
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Or whatever

446
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,140
I don't know internet basu file meal talk

447
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,460
It's cool to see you willing to be able to it's a challenge even with a handful of people much less

448
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,380
300

449
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,500
It's 300 this is 600 throwing money literally

450
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,820
I I'm definitely not a hand cam streamer. I don't think I don't don't expect any foot cam hand cam

451
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,380
After this, I'm gonna be honest. I'm like, oh, it's not for me, right? We're gonna do this as gently as possible. Okay

452
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
gentle

453
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:11,900
Thank you for coming to my ear cleaning foot spa experience

454
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
I ran to thank you for becoming a member

455
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,140
Now just let the brush

456
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,100
slowly glide

457
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,980
across your ear

458
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,220
And as the brush cleans the outer ear

459
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,260
Hold on you will find yourself. Hold on and I relax

460
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,860
There

461
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Just like this

462
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,900
Instructional ASMR just let me ASMR you

463
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
Oh, yeah, that's right. That's the money shot

464
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
Oh

465
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:03,580
I'm trip my poor pinky. Look how hard my pinky is trying right now. My pinky is like going to france without hardest time

466
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,180
I'm trying to like use

467
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,780
You can't be feetlings anymore after the stream, I don't think you're feetlings

468
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,180
I think uh, I'll stick to the VTuber model because I'm like so nervous with the webcam on

469
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
Plastic girl, thank you for the 10

470
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:30,060
If you like feet though, Emmy's doing foot cam stream later this week. Okay. Emmy Beezoo. Her link is in the description

471
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Subscribe and hit the bell if you are into

472
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,860
Because she's oh, I just dropped it. I didn't notice I dropped it. Hold on

473
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,300
Right and then I need to pass up to this one. This is my strong foot. Take my strong foot

474
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,020

475
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,420
Refling no don't fall grab on to my foot grab on to my french pedicure foot

476
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,860
French manicure pedicure

477
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:04,700
Thank you. Rune desolation to welcome the member. Thank you jargon hearts for becoming a member

478
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,220
This is literally my left foot is like unless

479
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,940
Unless I hold it like a pencil

480
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,980
Hold on I need to like dab against myself

481
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:23,260
Just know whenever you hear ear cleaning in my ASMR role plays. It's not done by my hands. It's done by my foot

482
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
I spit holding him

483
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:35,100
Thank you everyone for membership and supporting me. I appreciate it. We are testing if tier two needs to be higher than

484
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,900
um

485
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:46,140
4.99 US dollars, but I don't think it has to be not from what I've seen

486
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,460
Oh, no, it's dropped again. Jeez

487
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,860
This is really difficult. I thought I had a bit more. I think because it's so thin

488
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,540
Okay

489
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,300
It's gone again. I'm going to have to joe wield this

490
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,020
Double the twos

491
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,220
Uh

492
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,060
Be

493
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:21,100
G. Thank you for the membership. I appreciate it. We're swapping. We're swapping. I can't do this anymore

494
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,140
I said let's do the bubbles

495
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,380
I

496
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:36,700
The most bizarre monetization celebration I've ever seen. I've actually outdone myself. I've actually surprised myself

497
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,620
Weird this concept is can the bubble come?

498
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,980
Sorry, that was probably really loud. I'm so sorry

499
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,820
I hope no one's actually consuming this stream

500
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:59,020
Uh, uh, uh the level of like loud ASMR. No, don't listen to the stream at ASMR levels

501
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,940
Don't be silly my skull. We're fine. Okay, I was gonna say don't be silly and listen at ASMR levels

502
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:10,220
My feet are literally the pilot. You're telling me you trust my feet not to ever make a blip

503
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:17,820
I know my ear drum's still there. Ow my ear. Yeah. No, don't listen at ASMR levels. Don't be silly so much

504
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,180
There's absolutely no way right

505
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,140
So

506
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:32,300
For some reason stream elements can see when you guys gift other people but it won't register a membership if you bought it yourself

507
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,380
I don't know why

508
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
You're kicking in domestic

509
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,580
Fiat, thank you for becoming a member. Is your name fiat for a particular reason

510
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,980
I don't know

511
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,020
What that's strange. Yeah, I don't know why

512
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:03,020
No, I'm gonna lie to you your voice overpowers any sound I could have paired so far would mean the difference

513
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,940
Hi, Stony, congrats on unlock monetization. Thank you

514
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,940
Oh

515
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,300
Thank you

516
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:24,220
Remember just for anyone listening. You don't actually have the member by the way. I always have free content coming out

517
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,740
So, please don't worry

518
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:31,020
Please make sure you look after yourself first such as you pay off your debts because we live in a society

519
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,140
And if you're debt-free, it's good for you but bad for society

520
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,860
But we can get into that in another stream

521
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,060
John

522
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:46,540
John zero seven. Thank you for the membership. I appreciate it. Sorry about all the camera glitching by the way. This is a very

523
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,660
Dusty

524
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,660
webcam a very dusty

525
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,100
Narrow, thank you for becoming a member or narrow to two seven six

526
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,580
Like I was supposed to say your phone. I might want to do it because the cameras think okay

527
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,780
Peppermint did I say that right pepper peppermint

528
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,340
There's no arm

529
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,340
Okay

530
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,140
You never mind. Okay, never mind. Oh, we got there in the end

531
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,380
Don't worry, Stony, even if we get our ears bumped, you're still the best put stream

532
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,580
Oh, is that my new title now? Like the best

533
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,220
I would honestly take that title. I'm quite happy with that title

534
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,380
Oh

535
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,900
It's all right

536
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,900
My feet are here to comfort me

537
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,340
When it has been a long day. My sweaty grippers are here to

538
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,900
Pretend to tangle you because let's be honest. This isn't an ASMR stream. No one believes at all

539
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:56,940
This is an ASMR stream just because you have the three view. It doesn't make it an ASMR stream

540
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:04,540
Which is why the title is called monetization celebration stream and not ASMR

541
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:13,740
Uh, watch mercy stream. I was wondering if you can do a Q&A too. I would absolutely love to you. That is I would love to do a Q&A

542
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,060
Maybe we can read membership membership marshmallow. We can read marshmallow. Absolutely

543
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,700
Air Rock Starly

544
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,700
Air Rock Starly

545
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,020
Yes

546
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,020
We can 100% do

547
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,820
Marshmallow reading that would be fantastic

548
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,740
um, although mercy was like purposely like

549
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,980
Seeing stuff wrong, which was quite funny like really giving bad advice

550
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,540
Logan have a let. Thank you so much

551
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,740
If you hear my stomach, it's not because I'm hungry and starving

552
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,940
It's because I got our massive loaf of bread and Nina wouldn't come out before the stream

553
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:57,340
I went to the toilet three times and I never came out. I'm sorry for your stomach

554
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,100
This could be really funny for an April full stream. Well, you and the grippers out again

555
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,820
What would the title of the stream be?

556
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:16,380
Too many people ask real questions, but most of my scenes of the vice was real was it? Wait, hold on. Let me get my marshmallow

557
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,540
It's like as a movement

558
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,540
Uh-oh

559
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,940
And then I'll I'll go up the link. It's only a couple, okay

560
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:34,700
You ask me anything and before I can hardly say anything that is

561
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,380
Wait, where can I find this?

562
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,980
I would like to pin it but the love heart is in the way

563
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,220
I don't someone at youtube you're telling me not one person at youtube

564
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,900
Is aware of this issue and fuse

565
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,260
10

566
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:01,180
April fools. How does it April fools if I've already done it? I've already got you the gag is been done

567
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,780
Okay, that's my marshmallow thing

568
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,300
And

569
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,380
Oh

570
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:21,100
No, tier two is what's getting gifted mommy you have to raise a pegs for both ears

571
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:31,420
Wait, no, I only want emotes to be gifted. I wanted to leave emotes as $199 and I have to make it $5 for tier two

572
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,820
Honestly the mental

573
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:46,460
The mental stress of raising it by two cents is really good to me. Hey, babe badding gadding. Thank you for the membership. I appreciate it

574
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,020
We did warn you. I was just wanting them to work so badly

575
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,780
Oh, I don't want to raise the price. I have to apparently if I want to raise the price

576
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,020
I need to close the tier and then open up a new one. I don't even know what happens

577
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:05,740
It only lets you donate the 499 tier. Oh

578
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:12,140
I'm so happy to have you back. I missed you. I missed you too. Oh, that's so annoying

579
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,900
and

580
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,140
Oh

581
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:24,780
I have to raise the price by freaking dollar. So by dollar by a cent. So if I make it

582
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,900
You would leave emotes at $199 but tier two has to go up to $5.99

583
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,740
Oh

584
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,060
Does it actually have to be

585
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,780
Yeah, you has to go $5.99

586
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,740
It's just a dollar do it, but you don't understand

587
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,060
You don't understand the principle about how much I can glow and brag

588
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:03,660
That's only $9.99 to support your oshi for a month. I feel or you don't understand

589
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:14,860
Okay, but it's kind of more of the youtube channel having to make problems. It's fine. Oh

590
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,220
So right I guess after the stream

591
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,100
For those of you who sign up now for the tier two

592
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,820
I think you only have to pay the one dollar difference to get on the tier that is

593
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,580
Oh, that's so annoying. Can I can I make that new tier live at least or is this like

594
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,700
I don't know how youtube's gonna take this

595
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,660
Oh, I don't know youtube's gonna like me hold on

596
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,140
Levels edit levels

597
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,940
No

598
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:56,460
It locked in the price is locked in I don't want to put up a dollar, but I have to

599
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,260
Oh my god, please youtube sound right. I have to basically add a new let tier

600
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,900
Oh for goodness sake wifling member stream tier

601
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
Oh and

602
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,020
Oh for goodness sake

603
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,020
You know tier

604
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,460
Oh, okay. All right. Hold on. We're trying to do it together

605
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,580
Right. We need to do it in american double laws united states set a price

606
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,540
$5.99

607
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,980
Let's give that man a backshot. What wait, what did this happen?

608
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,460
We're doing it live. We're doing it live. We are wifling

609
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:53,820
Real I'll just put wifling member real tier because that's I'm out of things and then add a pair

610
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,260
Fucking

611
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,700
Membership stream membership only live streams

612
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,500
This the real deal

613
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,940
Y'all

614
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:09,980
And then pair of instructions nothing because you guys don't need to do anything the next what happens

615
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,660
I understand that once my offer is reviews improved. I'm unable to change to introduce a new price

616
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:22,380
I can create a new level and or delete any existing deleting a level will cancel existing memberships if that happens

617
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:28,300
Okay submit for review. Yes my tier my mem my freaking

618
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,500
membership streams do not have

619
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,540
Sorry, I'm like straight up talking. There's a thing

620
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,460
No, it does not come right. Your perk is being sent for review. It said

621
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,980
$5.99

622
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,940
Well, that's so expensive. I'm gonna have to stream like way more than

623
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,540
I'm gonna have to stream more to earn that because 5.9 is really getting expensive

624
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,060
There's even display the damn thing

625
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:09,900
Uh, right it doesn't display it because it's not been approved by youtube question mark

626
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,700
It's one dollar

627
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,860
So like all the tier 2s will be reset

628
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:24,380
So the tier 2s can upgrade via a dollar. I'm like 90% sure you already stream more than most. It's no problem

629
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:29,820
We can buy one less candy per month. You already stream every day. Yeah

630
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,060
Well, you're ready for multiple streams in one day of different things. Yeah

631
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,260
Am I losing my membership tier?

632
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,620
Maybe

633
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:48,060
Why does it not work? Why does it not work?

634
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:55,500
So what does this say is it there? No, it's not been approved. So you can't see it

635
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:02,460
Ellie bot. Thank you for the membership upgrade. Why does it specify you upgraded? That's so specific

636
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:07,020
Oh, no more streams. Oh, no. Thank you for fixing it

637
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,780
Yes, so we need to wait for youtube to approve the new tier and then that's the actual tier

638
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,820
Um, I guess but I don't know how long it takes to get it approved

639
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:25,020
I wonder actually I wonder if youtube is going to be able to see that is so similar to the second one

640
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:29,740
And they're going to be like, yeah, you're dumb. You praised it wrong. Didn't you and I'm like, yes, I praised it wrong

641
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,820
Please forgive me. I'm sorry

642
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,420
And then youtube will be like I will have mercy on yourself

643
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:41,260
Your levels are approved publish. Wait, what I already got approved wait

644
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,540
Hello youtube. Are you watching me right now? I promise I'm not doing anything bad

645
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,140
Feet are a natural part of the body. Um, thank you for monetizing me youtube

646
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:55,980
Please don't take it away. Is youtube actually here right now? Why did it just get approved?

647
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,740
Is it approved? Is it live? Wait, hold on. Let me try

648
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:07,180
Oh, okay. Wow it is. Okay, right. I'm going to delete the other tier

649
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:15,100
Okay, thank you for upgrading. Did I delete it now? And then oh my god, everyone's upgraded. Thank you so much

650
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,260
I'm so sorry be funds. I'm so so sorry. I've completely missed this

651
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,860
I've absolutely balls this one up. Right. I will delete the

652
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:30,380
How do I delete it? I do I will delete it delete this level if you delete a level

653
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,780
Members of that level will lose their membership

654
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:39,500
Consider notifying them before deleting encouraging them to change levels any member that purchased this level this month will be

655
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:47,100
Reimbursed. Okay, that's good. Any member that purchased this level this month will be reimbursed

656
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:53,740
Okay, youtube. I'm reading that myself. Once you submit your changes, they'll get approved. Delete

657
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,660
Next

658
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,660
Submit and review

659
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:05,020
I understand that once my offer is reviewed and approved all members of deleted levels will lose their membership

660
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,060
It will be reimbursed for the last month. Okay

661
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,700
Submit for review

662
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,260
We're doing it live. Okay, we can do it live

663
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,660
Do it live

664
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,740
publish

665
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,380
Did that work? What does it say now?

666
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,140
Wait, hold on. Let me refresh. Hold on. I think we did it

667
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:26,780
Hold on pause. I think we did it

668
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,940
We did it. Okay. I will not mess up with the girls

669
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,980
But I will okay there we go

670
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:37,900
I believe it's fully working now if you do gift memberships

671
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:42,300
It will only go to refling emotes which I need to add a sugar ton to

672
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:47,740
Because it was like you're only allowed to add four emotes until you get more members

673
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:53,100
So I'll add to the rest and I'll commission a ton more because with the amount of membership

674
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:00,220
I think there's quite more than 10 slots that I have. Thank you so much for your patience for me doing this

675
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,180
Thank you everyone who is I upgrading to the new tier

676
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,300
I do apologize

677
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,140
and

678
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:15,180
For the mistake. I really severely wanted membership gifting to be on emotes only

679
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,540
Because I didn't want to charge more than five

680
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,580
99 no

681
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,580
4.99

682
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:30,300
But thank you everyone. That's upgrading. Can I see your upgrades? Nope. Uh streaml is just really doesn't like it

683
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,100
Um, that's very curious

684
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,380
Uh very curious indeed

685
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:44,620
But I won't mess up for the girls when I enable it. I don't know if and when I don't know shebe's doing hers right now

686
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:50,300
If she is it's a surprise. I don't know if I'm the only one who's currently doing the membership member

687
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,860
Oh my god, I don't think wait, it's not telling me the upgrades

688
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,900
No

689
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,580
It's not telling me when you've upgraded

690
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,940
It's

691
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:11,500
Like on my screen on any screen. I'm so sorry. I don't think I can keep up with the upgrades. Thank you everyone who's upgrading. I appreciate it

692
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,700
I'm so sorry. I suck. I'm suck as a streamer

693
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,380
My apologies for such a

694
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:25,180
Unprofessional start, but then again, is it really me if it's not unprofessional? It's so over

695
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,100
We will support the cut for this regard. Thank you

696
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:35,020
I think it's not an upgrade now because it's the tears gone. So it's just a new membership. It's not register

697
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,540
Oh, is it register?

698
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,540
Oh no, this can't be wait, how am I supposed to?

699
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,780
Oh, wow, so it's not even telling me if it's an upgrade now

700
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:55,820
Okay, this is good membership not showing in your stream elements as a bug with your stream elements account

701
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,780
I've contacted their support of

702
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:03,260
Okay, I wonder if because stream elements is for twitch really

703
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,900
Um, but thank you so much everyone for upgrading or becoming a member of the tier. I actually

704
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,500
Can't remember if I've said around them

705
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:19,020
I thought we can just send it you're more professional than many streamers you treat us like humans

706
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,140
Who streams it doesn't treat you like a human?

707
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,900
What?

708
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,180
Please tell me there's not actually streamers like that. I remember

709
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:34,460
When uh, you guys taught me that people get actually jealous like if they see you in someone else's chat and I'm like

710
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,220
Huh?

711
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:40,780
That's real because I thought you guys were memeing on me like teaching me this and I'm like wait

712
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:45,420
Some some vtubers expect you to solely watch them and only then

713
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,660
Um, the it was very eye-opening very

714
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,220
Boy, thank you for the tip alert this

715
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,300
Yeah, for some reason I can see that on stream elements, but nothing else

716
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,620
I can see if someone gifts membership on stream elements as well, but that's it

717
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:09,100
Some people are a bit cray-cray about it. Hmm. I see be sweating right now

718
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:15,180
That was that was slightly different. I understand where she said that. Yeah, it's a lot more common than you think

719
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,060
I'm only gonna have time for you to try

720
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,700
My 12 hour streams. Yeah

721
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,700
Oh

722
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,780
Thank you for the gifted membership

723
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,500
Uh, I poor thank you

724
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:34,220
You oh you need to allow gifts. There may be a prompt in chat right now to allow gifts

725
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:42,460
Uh, make sure you click it. I think you it will say that you can receive gifts

726
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,740
I don't know how it works

727
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:53,100
My membership just got refunded. Did I miss something? Yes, I had to change the price because gifted membership

728
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,660
um

729
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,260
is

730
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:03,980
Was the wrong price. So thank you everyone who's resubbing. I believe you got a refund question mark question mark

731
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,620
Which is really good

732
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:22,940
Yeah, we all got refunded that was really quick. Honestly shout out to youtube if everyone literally got refunded that was so quick

733
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,980
Where is the join button on mobile? Get right. You're on mobile. There is no join button

734
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:33,420
It's just a mystery the join button's more of a suggestion than actual rules

735
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,100
And thank you everyone for resubbing. I'm so sorry, uh

736
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:43,500
D. W. Thank you for subbing giving kids any con

737
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:45,740
Sula's

738
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,740
loli wika

739
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:54,300
Asterix I'm like pretty sure I've said all these names before. I'm so sorry to anyone whose name I haven't said before

740
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,260
The join button is on the youtube page

741
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,220
Oh, if you want my youtube page, apparently

742
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:09,660
You guys have such funny gamer tags, honestly

743
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:18,860
Sorry, I meant 21 so for 21 days not all at once was in a rush to a brain loss for about to clarify

744
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,860
Okay, I was gonna say that was quite the length

745
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:27,020
Being inspired by the 21 days of brushing mean the micro plastics will be purged. Oh, that's okay. I like that

746
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,740
I subscribed on desktop with PayPal on the old 499. So what now

747
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:38,620
You should youtube should have already refunded you apparently apparently everyone already got refunded like within seconds

748
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,460
um

749
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,780
So the new tier is one dollar more due to the fact that gifted membership

750
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:53,100
Will go to emote tier which was what I wanted, but I was so stubborn and like oh, yeah youtube

751
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,700
I'm sure youtube will make sure that you can't deny

752
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:03,900
Streams at that price, but no no youtube insistent youtube insistent

753
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:09,580
Uh a PayPal alerted me about spending it should

754
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,700
Vtuber foot connoisseur. Thank you

755
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:19,580
What a name what a name to show up in this stream with

756
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:26,700
What a name. Thank you for becoming a member that's hilarious. Mika's biggest fan. I'm thinking

757
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,300
Art form biscuit. Thank you

758
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:37,340
What a name honestly, you like the french tip as a standard for you

759
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:43,420
That's right. Where other vtubers don't provide I come swipping in on week one

760
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,780
Week one. I give you what you seek

761
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,940
He really is a connoisseur. How's the winded toe doing?

762
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:54,780
I'm I had to take painkillers because it's getting a bit sore

763
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,620
I may or may not be making a doctor's appointment

764
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:01,420
About my toe because something

765
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:08,300
I'm going to see what happens. I'm going to go for a bath after the stream and let it sweat it out like in the hot water

766
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,340
in vultkine

767
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:13,340
black blood

768
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,220
Through

769
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,020
I still forgot this is week one. I mean technical. Well, we're just entered week two I guess but

770
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:26,300
If youtube stats updated immediately, we would have been monetized day one

771
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:31,900
But it took a whole week for it to thinking this is week two my apology fee. Yes fee

772
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:37,340
I'm so sorry if you don't like immersion breaking although I am literally as white as my

773
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,500
I'm actually I'm so white. I'm transparent. What the heck did I just move there?

774
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,980
Well, I think like you can literally see my veins and like the blue if you didn't know

775
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,700
Veins are blue and they carry deoxygenated blood back to your heart

776
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,180
They also have blip back

777
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,700
blow valves which are really good that stops the blood from

778
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:04,860
Going backwards in your system because if your blood ever goes backwards, that's very very very bad

779
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:09,020
And yeah, you're probably not going to make it if your blood starts going back

780
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:15,980
Strongest parallelism and we're like, yes, and then your arteries are what the little red veins are hold the redness

781
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,620
That's pushing oxygenated blood to

782
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:24,460
Where it's needed and then your circulatory system takes care of the rest. It's really quick. That's me

783
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:29,180
I could also talk about the heart if you like today. Thank you for signing up

784
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:34,540
Oh, you've got a banding of Isaac. That's uh, uh, what what's that x?

785
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:37,260
Uh, the fucking loser one

786
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,660
That's a

787
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,660
sass and fries

788
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:44,780
That's swine up. You guys really poke them on in video game

789
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:52,220
Uh pictures as quick as well. Thank you for signing out. Your feet are beautiful. Don't worry things. Yeah, you like you like seeing the

790
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,540
deoxygenated blood pumping through these veins

791
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,620
Um

792
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:05,580
I can't wait for you to play binding of Isaac November. I'm just warning you all right now

793
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:13,340
November is when binding of Isaac's 10 year anniversary is and molly player is unlocked

794
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:19,740
I am not going to be off that from you can see my hands in the shadow. I am I am instructing you

795
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:27,580
I am not going to be off that game for a very long time. Okay

796
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:30,220
Do you understand we play?

797
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:33,980
And then you all say I understand mummy and unison, okay?

798
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:39,260
We're going to be playing multiplayer Isaac all day long multiple days

799
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:45,180
I might even I might even commit to a week and alienate more people

800
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,300
with my binding of Isaac

801
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:55,180
Just so you understand better. Thank you for signing off. Thank you. I understand. I understand mommy. I understand mommy

802
01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:00,860
I understand. Yes. Good grieflings. Good grieflings. You will be rewarded for your

803
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:07,420
Uh, oh wait, so I didn't really so much my shadow was like cast you over you will be rewarded

804
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,940
Wait, if you can see my shadow, no, we'll do that in a membership. So

805
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,980
That was a very bad idea. That was a terrible idea

806
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:22,220
Little ears, please let me pick up this this q-tip or this ear cleaner as we say

807
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
Let me just pick up this ear cleaner

808
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,220
Just need to hold it like a bit

809
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,220
Put it there we go, right you ready for some ear cleaning

810
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:47,180
Oh, poor you see if you get trapped water in your ear, don't worry too much your ear can expel it at a later time

811
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:49,020
and

812
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:55,660
Some people actually find that expelling of the water in your ear quite. Oh wait, you can't even see me touch the

813
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,220
This is right. I'm going to do a basic

814
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,180
101

815
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:09,980
I'm going to show you a basic 101 for any ASMR is that's watching right now. Okay

816
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,340
And I know this is very hypocritical because I've just bashed the ear about

817
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,420
I'm going to teach you this right now live. Okay

818
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,900
You see this ear

819
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,900
Inside this ear this black section

820
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,980
This is what you don't do. Okay. This is what you don't do

821
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,220
You

822
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:48,540
No, no ASMR is you go around the microphone

823
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,220
Around gently, okay

824
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:59,340
Don't don't ever don't ever touch this bit here

825
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:05,340
That's the microphone. Okay, but go around the ear

826
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,460
Gentle

827
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:10,620
Gentle gentle gentle gentle

828
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,540
Okay, there 101 is more

829
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:33,900
This I'm gonna try and avoid doing with the tool

830
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:41,100
I just around the ear you don't need to go inside. No, no, no, no, I know I know you guys like to rush into it

831
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:45,100
Okay, why are you covered in band-aids? I caught myself making food

832
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,660
I hurt myself on my fingy

833
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,620
I'm glad to put a band-aid on

834
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:56,380
I'm I'm a bit of which is known as a klutz

835
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:01,100
Uh, thank you. I had nothing

836
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:04,380
Dried my karma the terminator above of the great

837
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,820
Does that mean you were making food with your foot? No this

838
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,660
I got all my toes done at the same time

839
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:30,780
But this part so when you get your toes done they take clippers and they they take this like push thing

840
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:33,020
They like pushed all my like

841
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,860
Toe skin back and stuff

842
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:40,540
But this section on this toe she has cut that was actually kind of sore touching that I'm not even gonna lie

843
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:44,700
She cut and sliced into it as she was cutting my toenail

844
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,220
Um, and it's quite sore and I'm not really sure what to do

845
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,300
and

846
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,620
I've not really experienced such a problem before

847
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,300
But we will we'll we say I think we'll be okay

848
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,380
Thank you star killer for becoming a

849
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,300
Do you use a new fluffy instead?

850
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,180
Wait a minute, I got a thicken tiny

851
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:22,780
It seems like you forgot for the next one in from yesterday spain II lol

852
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:29,420
Spain II that's what I said. Anyway, I'm off to work Celia and congrats on monetization. Thank you for the tip and yes

853
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:31,740
Thank you spain II

854
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:35,660
You could literally hear me like be scared to say it because I say it wrong all the time

855
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,860
Strani, do you have a stethoscope?

856
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:41,260
No, I don't

857
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:46,780
That would be quite the prop for a smart honestly having a stethoscope

858
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:53,740
Uh, you push back the cuticle of the nail bed cleaner, but the actual tool lining is not a cuticle

859
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,300
You should probably get it to like muckers

860
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:02,220
This is great, but I have class now. Okay, would you like class get educated get educated get educated get through well

861
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,860
Epsom salt foot bath

862
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:09,900
Yeah, I think I might do something like that because it's a weirdo

863
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,780
I heard someone say use it for heart beat ASMR. Oh

864
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,660
Would that even work? I don't know if we tried

865
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:23,180
I wouldn't mind buying that prop. I will buy that prop with my membership money. Thank you

866
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:32,140
I hope we're through here. Yeah, I think we'll be fine, right? Sorry. Let me look at the Q questions on marshmallow

867
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:40,700
Uh, congrats on the membership. You're the goodest girl around. What is your favorite meal to eat savory something savory?

868
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,980
Hello, will patreon subs get to see the membership streams on patreon?

869
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:51,980
Nope, they are two different subscriptions patreon and youtube activity are two separate things

870
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:55,020
So if you're interested in seeing your

871
01:14:55,740 --> 01:15:00,940
Your girl and your oh she deaths live then that is more youtube orientated

872
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:06,620
If you're interested in the alternative content that any member at valer offers, that is what is on patreon

873
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,140
Thank you for your question

874
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,220
You have big feet for a woman. Okay

875
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,980
I don't know what you want me to do with that. You might sign up for basketball

876
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,660
Right. Sorry. Let me just end the stream. I'm going to contact nba

877
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:29,740
Big feet. You think I have big feet. Are you sure it's not perspective because you have nothing else to judge?

878
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:36,780
Literally what big feet is good. Your feet are great. Literally everyone's been saying my feet are cute and stuff

879
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:39,180
And then you come here. You're like, yeah, your feet are massive. I'm sorry

880
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:44,220
Do you want me to bind them like we're in fucking china or something like back when they used to bind the lowest feet?

881
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,900
Is that we want you want a little fucking lowest feet? Get out of here with that shit

882
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,700
I don't know anything about food, but they're normal me. Yeah

883
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,900
Like oh, sorry, excuse me

884
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:03,260
Oh, I see when I spawned in uh when I spawned in I actually picked this foot size manually

885
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:07,420
You know, there's a little slider bar and everything banana for scale. I don't even have bananas

886
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,860
Oh, do you want this do you want my stoop waffle that I ate yesterday for scale?

887
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,500
There there's your scale

888
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:17,980
Your fear

889
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,380
I've no sense of permanent. So I'm just going to assume you're a talking therapy. Honestly

890
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:30,380
Who said that who I don't know what feet size are you I actually don't know

891
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,180
um

892
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:38,060
I've not bought a boat. When did I buy a new pair of shoes? I've completely forgot

893
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:42,780
I had to get measured for them actually when I got a new pair of shoes because I didn't know what my shoe size is

894
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:53,580
Uh, I don't know what to say here to be honest, but I'm glad for she be uh, don't remember

895
01:16:54,060 --> 01:17:00,220
She's really cute and the gap was really nice. Sorry strongy and uh, the year long wait was worth it. Oh, I'm glad you think so

896
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,540
Some people were asking like weren't you worried about like everyone being disappointed after a year's wait and I'm like

897
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:13,820
I'm sorry, but if you're if you're a leaflin, you knew what you knew we were mean

898
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:16,780
You knew I was rambling. You knew exactly what was going on

899
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:21,180
Merci, when are you doing about your membership stream for no particular reason?

900
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,220

You have thank you for signing up your profile picture around to me

905
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:44,940
I could have bought a freaking hip no thing and put it on the floor and hypnotize people to my feet

906
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,940
I'm doing so funny though

907
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:01,660
We're squishing the ball we're going back to squishing the ball. It's so easy to squish a ball

908
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:12,940
Feet cam feet stream q&a. Will you ever beat the peeler allegations?

909
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,900
I don't think so

910
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:19,820
I was gonna um

911
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,460
So when the girl started posting it for free

912
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:27,420
I was like, oh, I was gonna do a donut on reward where I wrap my 3d open

913
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,580
like a poly bag

914
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,100
like a plastic bag

915
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,220
and

916
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:35,660
Hypnotizing the reefing to your feet to convince them I worship the feet honestly

917
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:40,860
Goes in a strong a stream your feet are big good for gathering produce all day giley

918
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,740
Literally, I was like, I've never seen you in my life

919
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,020
And now you want to do it for free? Yeah

920
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:55,740
I was gonna make it a fun donut on work because I was gonna do it on 3d. Oh mate

921
01:18:56,620 --> 01:19:00,140
But I need to wrap it up to make sure it doesn't you know short circuit

922
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,060
um

923
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,540
Was this a bit being in a bag might need that stream

924
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:10,780
Hey on reefing on what pee pee's on you

925
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,820
You still can

926
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:27,580
3d moment as terrible honestly. Oh my like donut on plans are absolutely outrageous

927
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,980
So I was like, hi, love you. That's all

928
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,580
Really

929
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:34,860
So says pokemon or digimon. Sorry. I only saw pokemon

930
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:41,020
I never got into digimon because wasn't it wasn't the digimon meme that's literally like

931
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,140
Oh

932
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:48,300
This like cute adorable thing ends up developing like an ak-47

933
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:53,100
And like a galeel on one arm a famous on the other

934
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,860
The only big thing strenny has is her

935
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:04,940
Her her heart she has a really big heart

936
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:11,580
Hearing your feet sweat stick to the ball reminds me of ear coughing when the hand leaves the ear

937
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:14,780
Stop wait, I think my feet are sweaty enough to do

938
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,460
What does this sound like?

939
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:36,220
Oh, that's great. Oh, you actually like it. Thank you destiny to enjoy, okay

940
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:42,380
It sounds nice

941
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:48,700
Can I do to it? Can I do both? Hold on. I think I can do joe wield ear cupping

942
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,580
Oh, sorry, I just peaked the audio

943
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:56,940
It's a bit more difficult this way

944
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:02,780
It sounds good. Wait, there really are sticking to the ear

945
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:08,860
Did you miss the pop rock segment where I proved how sweaty my feet are via pop rocking?

946
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:13,740
I just realized the maker swap is it? Oh, no

947
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:20,700
Is it on the wrong side I can swap it out manually if you want

948
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,660
Peaking the audio just means you're peeking

949
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:33,900
You want to hear my heartbeat from my foot? I don't know if I can do that

950
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:41,340
I don't think you can hear it

951
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:47,660
I go here 10 minutes ago. Yeah, the start of the stream

952
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:49,580
um

953
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:55,500
I may or may not have opened up pop rocks and put them on the soles of my feet to prove how sweaty my feet are

954
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,740
And they popped

955
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:03,580
No outside influence necessary. So I have proven that I do have hypo hydrolysis

956
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:11,340
Not that anyone needed proof. I don't know why you would make up such an accusation in all honesty. I would anyone want it

957
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:14,460
Thank you

958
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,460
Glaesos

959
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
Yeah

960
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,580
So fancy

961
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:37,420
I get sweaty feet too. Yeah, uh, just just as a mild warning to anyone who's listening if you have permanent sweaty hands and feet

962
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:43,180
Uh, please do consider uh autism. Um, that's all that's my note

963
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,060
Oh, can we do toe tapping ASMR?

964
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,940
Oh, yes

965
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:04,780
Uh, yes, it's actually a very common satree um of having autism uh by having permanently sweaty hands and feet

966
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:11,180
What if you have hairy palms? I don't actually know

967
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:14,780
Maybe you're Italian because aren't Italians hairy?

968
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:17,820
I am acoustic

969
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,020
Oh, that explains a lot actually. Yeah

970
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:24,700
Yeah, we have strong arism though

971
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:33,980
Little toe tapping ASMR, that's right. That's right average vtuber recharged thousands for this in a donut stall on me

972
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:36,140
You get it for free

973
01:23:37,340 --> 01:23:42,300
I never noticed it until you actually mentioned it, but yeah, I do have autism and sweaty hands and feet

974
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:46,220
Yeah, it's a very common trait. Um another sub if you are

975
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,700
um

976
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,900
Depending on the scale, however you want to scale you can do it different ways

977
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:55,340
But if you are on kind of like the high needs side of autism

978
01:23:55,420 --> 01:24:01,500
Um, if you do toe walking only that is a massive indicator a humongous indicator

979
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:06,620
That you are kind of on the upper uh scale of the prison needs. Thank you

980
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:08,860
gin

981
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,860
Isuru channel

982
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,860
And thank you

983
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,180
So cracks

984
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,860
Uh

985
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:23,740
I used to have I have to use antiperspirant on my feet anytime I had otherwise it's blister sitting

986
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:26,700
Huh, I never noticed that before but you're right about the sweaty feet. Yeah

987
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:34,380
The toe walking is too real toe walking is a humongous indicator that um

988
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,100
The child that normally it's noticed in childhood

989
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:43,740
Um, you can unlearn it as you get older, but it's a massive indicator

990
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:49,020
I used to walk all the time. Yes. It is one of the biggest giveaways if a

991
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:53,420
Child is autistic basically if they toe walking

992
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,340
Got used to some powers for goods

993
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:01,100
Literally well like without mine like I had um

994
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:04,060
Um

995
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:09,260
It was stroking my ego. They're like, I don't know how you do it. I don't know how you like stream

996
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,580
I'm like

997
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:15,900
Do I tell them the truth and the reason I can stream all the time is because I have autism

998
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:20,940
Or am I just like oh, I'm just really passionate. I just really like what I get to do like

999
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:29,260
For me, it's always sitting in weird ways that put so much pressure on my feet that I keep getting callous

1000
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,460
Yeah

1001
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:34,940
I told run is that similar told running maybe isn't the biggest indicator

1002
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,620
And in children, but then like you can start like it's

1003
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,580
She's unstoppable

1004
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:45,900
And I walked on toes as a child and then my feet are

1005
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:49,580
Don't don't be shy. You can finish the rest of your sentence

1006
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:53,180
We don't bite here. We don't bite from around these books

1007
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,260
I got

1008
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:13,100
This is enough to what else can I do I freaking I've brought this stick in some people like wouldn't stick a somewhere

1009
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:18,700
I've never particularly found it easy to record it. So the only thing I can do really is just tapping

1010
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:21,420
like on the ear

1011
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,900
Oh

1012
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:30,300
Any other major indications of autism? There's tons like

1013
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:34,940
Stimming with hands lack of eye contact is a big one

1014
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,100
and

1015
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:42,540
My biggest question to you if you're like sitting here and you're like hold on a minute. She's starting to she's spitting the truth

1016
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,220
My biggest question if you genuinely are like, huh is

1017
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:49,180
How different would the world look if

1018
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:54,700
If everyone thought like you how different would the world look if everyone thought like you and before you're like

1019
01:26:54,700 --> 01:27:00,380
That's not an indication. Just think about it a bit more. Okay, just think a wee bit deeper into that question

1020
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,380
Okay

1021
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:09,100
Anyway gifts are messed up everyone's getting tier two one dollar

1022
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:12,780
For something we really wanted so why

1023
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,780
One more dollar for something we really wanted so why

1024
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,900
Why was that because

1025
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:30,140
Oh wait, is this an old sorry, this may be an old message

1026
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:35,180
Sorry, I'm reading

1027
01:27:35,980 --> 01:27:39,100

1028

Okay. Yeah, sorry. Those were old ones talking about the tier. Thank you for anyone's info about the teams

1029

01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,740
World ends up addicted to watching veal

1031
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:57,020
That's how we take over you guys thought my hypnosis was to drown you all. No, it was to

1032
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,860
Oh my god, my feet are so tall

1033
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:05,180
I'll put your mops on to protect you because

1034
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,900

1035
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:14,780
Uh

1036
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,420
Right, let's see where we are

1037
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:22,540
What strongy you're the strongest at least mentally

1038
01:28:22,540 --> 01:28:27,820
I don't know about physically me who struggled to open a can of fizzy juice on the hand cam stream

1039
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:33,660
Can I buy or use band-aids to put on an alt or um

1040
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:39,980
This one literally has gunk on it. I don't I don't know what's going on this tool, but we'll figure we'll figure it out

1041
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,940
Uh girl I've ever known

1042
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:49,740
But someone like you should never mess with infections get that tool checked ASAP. Oh monk. Yes, okay

1043
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:54,860
If you had to take painkillers, you can go the ER, but I know you'll never do it because you're a sweetheart

1044
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,620
but somebody else could

1045
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:00,060
Sue that pedicure. Oh no, she didn't mean it

1046
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:06,700
You should at least show them the medical papers you get from the hospital monk. Yes. Am I going to the hospital because I'm a toad

1047
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:12,220
I'll tell you what I'll update you some twitter after my bath

1048
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:16,860
I'll do a soul plingy and see what happens because so so normally

1049
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,100
and it makes out

1050
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:25,020
Would you be playing and would you be interested in playing omega strikers on stream? It's a 3v3

1051
01:29:26,140 --> 01:29:29,900
mob style air hockey that's free to play. Oh my god. That sounds fun

1052
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:32,860
Omega strikers

Oh, no, the mega strikers look so cool

1057
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,700
All their waifus are cute

1058
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:54,540
Isn't this free to play? Oh, no, it's nintendo

1059
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:58,620
Oh, no

1060
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,940
It's nintendo

1061
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,420
Nintendo so expensive

1062
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,900
Is it nintendo?

1063
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:17,100

1065
01:30:23,180 --> 01:30:29,100
It's fine if it's on pc. It can't be overcharged that much if anything is specifically published by nintendo

1066
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:33,500
Just know you're gonna get rinsed out ours for the price. It's absolutely ridiculous. Whoa

Wait, I can see that it showed up pan up to shion pan option. Thank you so much for oh my goodness all those gifted memberships

01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:07,420
Um, i'm so sorry. I can hardly say the name pan optician. Surely it's pan optician pan optician

1072
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:12,700
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted. Thank you and congrats everyone who called up their face

1073
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,460
It's all coming together

1074
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:20,140
Yes, you'll have to like I think you have to talk in chat

1075
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:25,420
Even if you just say a simple message like hi, and then it'll be like you could have got this enable it

1076
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:36,700
I love you. Will you go on a date with me? You better come to the convention. I'm giving everyone roses

1077
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,380
I think if we ever did like an actual convention

1078
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:45,420
I'd love to buy like single roses so I can give it out and I'd be like, ha, that's right

1079
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:50,380
You have beat all the odds of a man never receiving a flower before he

1080
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,500
All right, hold on. Let me hydrate let me hydrate

1081
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:06,940
What convention where no, there's been no picked convention

1082
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:12,860
But I really want to try it once in my life. I've never been to a convention before

1083
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:18,060
I've never been to like a location that has been self identified for nerds

1084
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,660
um

1085
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,420
And dorks like us

1086
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:27,580
So it would be a very unique experience. Wow. That's like literally real-time assigning

1087
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:31,580
Um gifted memberships. That's crazy

1088
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:35,260
That's so cool. Um

1089
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:37,420
Vial or conno

1090
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:44,540
Well, the only thing is I have absolutely crippling traveling anxiety, which is a bit of a problem

1091
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,540
There's a big convention in california. I think

1092
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:54,540
And a lot of the girls would actually be able to make it manually. I think if we all went but

1093
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,300
I don't want to let the team down

1094
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,300
There's a lot of issues about getting on a plane

1095
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:10,220
Um, and I get violently motion sick as well. This is why I just want to farm with

1096
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:18,220
You refling because I can't travel anywhere. I get so sick like I had to get a taxi

1097
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:27,180
I think a taxi to my dentist appointment and I it's not even that far away from me. I was violently ill. I was like

1098
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,700
Oh

1099
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:32,380
I was like, can I just put the window down and the guy's like, yeah, yeah

1100
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:35,980
He's like on his phone talking to his pal and all that. I'm getting scared

1101
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:39,020
Oh

1102
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:43,420
I'm gonna use thank you narrow for becoming a member. I can see that

1103
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,700
Get drunk and pass out on the plane. Honestly

1104
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:52,300
I got I will be so high on medication. See the problem is I don't want to be like

1105
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,380
I'm definitely going to a convention

1106
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:59,260
Because I have a bomb and a bomb really messes up things that happen in real life

1107
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:05,100
And I don't want to be like, oh, you should go to this convention in melbourne for this on this day at this time

1108
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:10,620
I'll be here because I don't want anyone to spend money to come out on the the sole reason to come

1109
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,020
Like see me type thing

1110
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:16,300
Because if my freaking a bomb gets in the way

1111
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:18,140
I

1112
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:22,540
Oh, wait, I'll tell it. I'll tell it in another stream. Okay, but I have a really freaking

1113
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,740
It's really frustrating, but it's quite humorous at the same time

1114
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:30,940
But yeah, you could be the one of those robots that meet up. Yeah, that's possible first mercy next round

1115
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:32,940
Do other girls have motion sickness?

1116
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:37,900
Oh, no, I can still play video games. I have like travel motion sickness

1117
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:43,420
Like a parent. Oh, wait. No, she put those goofy goggles on her eyes. I'm pretty sure she did

1118
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:48,140
No, you're right about mercy. She put those funny goggles on her eyes

1119
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:55,740
What is a bomb a bomb stands for anxiety because people are sick of hearing about it

1120
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:59,820
Like the word anxiety. So I just call it a bomb as a substitute

1121
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:01,420
um

1122
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:03,420
It's ear problems

1123
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:08,460
Oh, well, I can fix your ear problems with my sweaty feet. Oh, yes

1124
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:12,780
Oh, yes, you can handle that. Can't you? So a little tool rubbing ASMR?

1125
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,660
Yeah

1126
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:17,660
That's right

1127
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:23,900
Maybe don't say that in airport. Oh, no. Yeah, we we're not going to use that terminology

1128
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:29,180
I think stronti can fix their ear problems on her page

1129
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,060
I mean your motion sickness. Sorry

1130
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:42,060
Do you take game suggestions? I absolutely do. I have absolutely no issues. Um

1131
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:45,260
A lot of streamers kind of don't

1132
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:53,020
No, that's not nice. I will not generalize. Please. Don't be afraid to gap her bucket. Thank you for becoming a member

1133
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:57,180
and please don't be afraid to you don't ask me questions or

1134
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:01,900
Um game suggestions are perfectly fine with me. I have no problems

1135
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,700
and

1136
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:09,660
It's that how many people use a bomb as a word for being male to interpret. Yes, like I

1137
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:16,220
I kind of generally touch up on the subject

1138
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:19,500
Just because like I am very thankful to be where I am

1139
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:21,820
versus where I was

1140
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:26,780
And but I feel like people are so tired and burned out hearing about it and like, oh, everyone's got it

1141
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:29,100
And I'm like, yeah, I need wonder everyone's got it. Have you seen

1142
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:35,660
Have you seen society today? We live in a society. No wonder everyone's gone up. Anyway, we can do that

1143
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:41,100
I can talk about that in another stream. This stream is supposed to be me celebrating monetization

1144
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:45,020
And yet again, I'm talking about the how that we need the downfall of society. It's terrible

1145
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,500
It's shocking

1146
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:52,540
And we got his dempa in here. No way dempa is in here staring at my toes right now. Oh god. She is

1147
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:57,340
Hi dempa. I have no idea what size my feet are

1148
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:02,540
I bought like new shoes last year and they had to measure them and I already forgot

1149
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,260
My shoes aren't in this room

1150
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:09,740
Sorry dempa. I had to be this way. I literally am

1151
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:18,620
Yeah, dempa, you should do foot cam ASMR with me. You want to you want to come over?

1152
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:24,540
I feel like you would have smaller toes than me. I've never had a pedicure before

1153
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:30,620
Oh, well, if you ever get one, just make sure they don't mess up your toe by the way because mine's an agony. So

1154
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,740
Yeah, you definitely need to be careful with that

1155
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,660
Here's my beefling heart

1156
01:37:37,660 --> 01:37:39,820
The world is uh, there's no surprise

1157
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:47,020
I have a broken pinky though. Oh, no. Can you know like spread your little look at my pinky do this little dance?

1158
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:49,740
Oh

1159
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:58,860
I don't want someone to touch my feet. I get a massage is very unique sensation

1160
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,860
um

1161
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:04,700
Very very unique sensation dempa x20 for you ASMR

1162
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:09,900
Poor dempa's pinky thing

1163
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:16,940
Are there any game genres you want to avoid? Um, I don't like oh, this is going to be controversial

1164
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:20,620
I might filter some people with this one. Um, the reason

1165
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:27,340
I do not like games like resident evil where you give me ammunition, but it does not perish the enemy

1166
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:35,340
Do not give me enemies that cannot be perished. What is the point in having an ammunition resource management section?

1167
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:40,620
If it does not perish the big bad enemy, please do not suggest these kinds of games

1168
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:44,780
It will turn into a rage stream real quick and I will become so scots

1169
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:50,780
You will not actually be able to understand me. I'm sorry, but do not give me ammunition if it does not perish the enemy

1170
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:53,500
Simple as I mean that's fair preach

1171
01:38:54,620 --> 01:39:00,540
Did you put hydrogen peroxide on it? No, I'm going to take a bath. I'm going to take this off and go for a bath

1172
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,460
and

1173
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,460
Do salt in the bath

1174
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:09,580
You mean you like that 30 bullets to kill that one enemy? Yeah

1175
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,300
Yeah

1176
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:16,220
I'm sure the resident evil games are good. However, I have fantastic news

1177
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:19,660
I have five gen mates that are more than likely to play that kind of genre

1178
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:26,220
I've never played resident evil my I watched my dad play resident evil

1179
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:33,020
And it started off in Africa, but he couldn't even get through it and we were both watching it and we were like

1180
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:37,980
Well, I was watching him play it and both of us were looking at each other like what is this?

1181
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:41,100
Like he couldn't get through it. I couldn't get through it

1182
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:43,180
um

1183
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:49,260
Oh res fat. Yeah, I was like set in Africa or something like I it was like super hot savannah type thing

1184
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,180
um

1185
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:56,460
And both of us were just staring at each other like this is the biggest piece that we've ever bought

1186
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:57,820
um

1187
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:01,260
Because normally we like play games together or share games together type thing

1188
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:05,180
You watch your dad play the second worst one. Oh, well, there you go

1189
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:10,700
Literally, we I think we've got 20 minutes into it. Both of us were looking at each other like yeah, that's that game's going back

1190
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,940
We're gonna hand it in for a different game

1191
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:20,780
Is there something you've always wanted to try that you've made for 100 games that gave to you?

1192
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:24,940
I've want to play

1193
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:27,980
Civ 6

1194
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:31,020
um

1195
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:36,380
I have done one run on it and I enjoyed it but I was very dumb and I want to play boulder's game

1196
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:38,380
I definitely want to try that for the first time

1197
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:43,260
But I think it will be a patience testing stream because I get worried about playing a game for the first time

1198
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:46,300
um

1199
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,340
5 and 6 are some of the best sold ones regardless

1200
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:53,660
Wow, I think for free. I yeah, congrats on monetization

1201
01:40:56,140 --> 01:40:58,140
Uh, let's just make sure

1202
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,900
Right, I think

1203
01:40:59,900 --> 01:41:01,500
um

1204
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,500
As soon as I think your feet are very beautiful. I'm hot. Thanks. Do you have my toes? I got my toes down

1205
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:09,740
Look at that stepping

1206
01:41:09,740 --> 01:41:15,740
Look at that side profile on the toe spread. Can I just get a zoom in an appreciation for the side profile of toe spread? Yeah

1207
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:23,260
I mean look at that. You you already know you're welcome. Yeah, you're welcome. You owe me one membership. You're welcome

1208
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:25,260
Um

1209
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:32,060
The new boulders gate. Yeah, I've never played the boulders gate. Apparently. Yeah, someone says it's cool. But primary's cool

1210
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:36,860
That's delicious. You played any rts

1211
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:40,860
Uh starcraft. No, my dad played it

1212
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:43,820
age of empires

1213
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,380
Civ 6 is a dumpster fire

1214
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:47,980
Is that actually

1215
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:50,620
Didn't they not ren- announcers a new Civ 6?

1216
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:53,340
Yeah, a new Civ coming out

1217
01:41:56,140 --> 01:42:00,540
Long toes wait, they actually have long toes stop. Do I have long toes?

1218
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:04,300
There you go. I'm gonna start again. Hold on. I'm gonna get that really right. Hold on

1219
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:06,540
that

1220
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:11,980
I don't know. I feel like I have like the toe because you can have like people some people have like toes that oh wait

1221
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:14,780
Sorry, you can't see any of them. Hold on. Let's try this again

1222
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:19,660
Some people have toes where they like are all the same length like they come across like that

1223
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,380
minor like

1224
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:23,260
the

1225
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,660
That shape I don't know if that makes any sense

1226
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:32,380
You feel cute like your toes are cute. I'm gonna start getting a complex about my freaking toes. Are you joking?

1227
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:39,900
Right, how long are my toes right? We'll do it in inches because you're all american. You said 2.5 inches is

1228
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:43,660
Wait, hold on. I'm like trying to show you and do it at the same time

1229
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:46,780
Where is 2.5?

1230
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,780
Uh

1231
01:42:50,220 --> 01:42:56,140
Where I am my my index toe is just bigger than an inch

1232
01:42:58,620 --> 01:43:06,220
Sorry, I just hit the mic. Oh, you're not american. I'm sorry. Um, um, um, hold on. Uh, okay, roughly

1233
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:09,020
3 centimeters tall

1234
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,580
About 3 centimeters tall

1235
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:16,060
I am fended long toe equals more than joy. What the fuck is an inch?

1236
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,900
Three of these baby

1237
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:25,820
Measure the entire foot. Oh, no, but then you will know I've got big feet

1238
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:30,860
I did oh no my foot's bigger than the ruler. Like if the ruler goes there, it's like

1239
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:34,940
If this ruler's 15 centimeters

1240
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,900
Wait, hold on. Let me put it as a thing

1241
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:46,300
Okay, I put it on my heel and it's there on my toe. So I'm like 16 centimeter feet

1242
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:50,940
Yeah, sorry, that was like the most known way to do it

1243
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:54,460
But I did it

1244
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,860
Big feet are good

1245
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:00,940
But you have no big feet the mic is low

1246
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,900
I don't know. I might have I

1247
01:44:04,140 --> 01:44:09,340
I genuinely thought I was like average on everything. Um, but then when I did the

1248
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:13,420
Sweet eating cam and everyone saw my hands. You're like, oh, your hands are so small

1249
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,220
But when we started measuring it together, I was like, oh, okay

1250
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:23,020
Imagine if this is popped right now because I'm a sweetie

1251
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,100
Can you measure how wide you can spread your

1252
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,100
Big toe and the one next to it. We have weight

1253
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:40,940
Uh, I don't know like because you could like this is that we want to hold on

1254
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:45,420
Thank you so very sweetie

1255
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:53,660
Like that or do you mean like the actual foot? I don't know it depends. That has to be malleable

1256
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,100
Uh, this is gross measurement

1257
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:02,300
It has to be malleable like it has to be like because I can grip stuff like

1258
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:10,220
I'm gonna just grab my hold on now. Can I move you a little bit? There you go. There you go. Just pop you there and good boy

1259
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,020
head pass

1260
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:15,020
Uh this

1261
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:18,460
It depends because like that is you know

1262
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:22,140
And I can put it in between like

1263
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,900
I

1264
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,460
In the culture she would have nice grippers

1265
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:38,060
Down her renders and chat. I guess your feet are small, but it makes your toes really long and compact

1266
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:43,820
No, I'm gonna get a freaking complex after this dream. I don't know. I just thought my feet were really normal

1267
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:47,980

Baby boy

You want in

1273
01:46:04,140 --> 01:46:06,140
Baby boy

Vigo

01:46:08,060 --> 01:46:10,060
Vigo you can't even just oh

Gimli Gimli do you want to do you want to come on stream?

1277
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:18,940
She's so confused right now. She's like, what are you doing?

1278
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:21,740
Gimli come here

1279
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:29,340
Gimli come come right here. Come right here. Show the people how adorable you are. No, that's the wrong way

1280
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,060
Gimli what's this

1281
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:33,740
Gimmels

01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:40,380
Yes, yes, okay. Just gently don't knock over the webcam. I'll cry Gimli don't knock over it right out

1283
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:42,780
You're gonna knock the webcam over Gimli

1284
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:47,420
I've only got 10 more minutes. I'll be out in a minute Gimli

1285
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:51,420
I didn't get it though

1286
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:56,620
Give me 10 minutes Gimli just 10 minutes is all in me. Sorry. My tube is sweet to hear that

1287
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,380
Mommy Gimli that was a

1288
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:06,380
She was so gonna knock over that way of cramps. I was like get out of Gimli. I could tell oh

1289
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,500
Oh, I've done it now haven't I?

1290
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:12,860
Gimli 10 minutes and I'm

1291
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:15,820
Stop it

1292
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:19,180
Your dog is very cute. Thank you

1293
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:30,300
I'm terrified for eight years. You're for your perfect. Thank you

1294
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:37,020
Literally, I shouldn't have brought her in because now she's gonna want the attention and I was like, I'm not finished. I'm not finished

1295
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:39,500
Give me 10 minutes girls

1296
01:47:40,060 --> 01:47:44,220
10 minutes of getting screamed up by a cat. Literally a cat does not understand

1297
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:47,100
Feet time

1298
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:50,460
She doesn't have a cat. She has 10 doves

1299
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:57,820
Yeah, that was my Gimli. I thought it was my baby boy Vigil

1300
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:00,700
um

1301
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,700
Thank you very much

1302
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:09,100
Voltaums and thank you for ronald. I appreciate the gifts and memberships. I could

1303
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:11,820
um

1304
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:16,780
Cats and feets. Yes. I picked up. Thank you. Caleb Harris as well

1305
01:48:18,140 --> 01:48:19,500
um, I

1306
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:26,540
adopted Vigil and Gimli and their starting situation is actually really sad, but it's a really happy ending so I

1307
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,980
I messaged a shelter and I was like, hey

1308
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:31,980
um

1309
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,020
I work from home

1310
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:38,060
I would love to open up my home to two cats that cannot be separated if you didn't know

1311
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:41,980
For adoption agencies and all that kind of thing. It's really hard to re-home

1312
01:48:42,620 --> 01:48:44,300
doubles

1313
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:46,300
That are inseparable

1314
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:50,860
Um, so I messaged them and they came back and they were like we have these two

1315
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,620
Ruffians

1316
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:57,820
And they have come from an hoarder's home. Um, which makes them un

1317
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:02,540
They cannot be with any other animal but each other. Um

1318
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:12,540
So I went and visited them and they were these poor scaredy cats. They genuinely were so terrified of any humans. Um

1319
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,500
Thank you, yummy for the memba

1320
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:20,380
Thank you everyone who's like remembering as well for the correct tier. I do apologize about messing up that tier

1321
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:24,300
Um, yes, they're a bonded pair and they can't be separated

1322
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:30,700
But I just want to say the universe works in mysterious ways. Sorry. I know I'm supposed to be doing ASMR

1323
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:33,260
I'm just trying to call them right now without the microphone for

1324
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:36,620
The world will work in mysterious ways now

1325
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:41,580
I do not believe in supporting certain cat breeds which are bad for their health

1326
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:44,940
An example of that is the munchkin breed

1327
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:49,660
Vigo is mixed tabby and munchkin breed

1328
01:49:50,700 --> 01:49:55,100
The universe will find ways to laugh in your face

1329
01:49:56,060 --> 01:50:05,020
Because I am a big believer in like completely no longer breeding them and not letting them be a genetic line any further because it's so bad for their health

1330
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:13,900
San Baroli, thank you very much. And then the universe laughed in my face and said guess what?

1331
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:18,140
Your baby boy is a hafu and I'm like, okay

1332
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:21,340
Motons, thank you for the upgrade

1333
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:26,780
So yeah, if you ever think the universe doesn't have a little joke for you

1334
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:30,540
Oh, I assure you the universe is gonna it's got a joke for you

1335
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:34,620
Yeah, like pugs. Yeah, I am a bit of a

1336
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:42,060
Please don't support but this was just me. Um, like scotch fold cats. Um, that was adorable as they look

1337
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:49,020
Absolutely not. Hairless cats. Absolutely not. A lot of people will say like but I can look after them

1338
01:50:49,260 --> 01:50:53,740
It's not about you looking after them. It's about the general population looking after them

1339
01:50:53,980 --> 01:51:00,140
Does the general population gonna do all these steps about looking after their cat and the hairless ones

1340
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:05,820
Gaining at a bath and removing the dirt cells because it's not got freaking fur. No, it's not. Thank you the bigger picture

1341
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:10,380
Anyway, um, don't get me started on um

1342
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:14,620
Animal breeding because a lot of it is just absolutely insane

1343
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:21,340
I'm waiting till you get started and learn about what pedigree dogs are. Pedigree dogs are just certified. Um

1344
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:28,220
You literally get a certificate saying yes, this dog has been produced via freaking insane amounts of um

1345
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:34,700
Cest and it was like why is pedigree even a thing? Get a mutt. Muts are the healthiest kind of dog you can even get

1346
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:42,620
Like ah a mixed breed cats. They're the healthiest kind you can get like don't support the little munchkins that have freaking stilts for legs

1347
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:47,020
It's actually so freaking sad and I can't eat. Oh, oh, I could really start

1348
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,900
Anyway, uh, yeah, the universe will always have a joke for you

1349
01:51:57,180 --> 01:52:00,460
So, yeah, uh, I despise munchkins

1350
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:04,060
I don't for the for the kindness of the poor cat

1351
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:10,140
They shouldn't be a thing and then the universe said oh, by the way, Vigo is a half mix of tabby and munchkin

1352
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:16,300
And yeah, he has saucer eyeballs. I should actually post a picture of my babies. Um

1353
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:21,980
But yeah, Vigo has saucer eyeballs. He's so adorable

1354
01:52:22,700 --> 01:52:24,700
and the universe won

1355
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:31,580
Hey, do you do rabble and durian streams where you just go down a bunch of rabbit holes? Oh, absolutely

1356
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:39,500
Um, I did it in my sky room one. I started talking about the navy streamer overload ending where she becomes a god

1357
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:43,580
And starts a new religion type thing or like starts a new society

1358
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:46,940
Um, and like I started talking about conspiracy theories and stuff

1359
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:51,020
But I don't like going too deep into it because I know it like really just like people didn't like it

1360
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,660
So I was like, okay, I will maybe it too much. So it's me

1361
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,900
Hey, my mom used to read lavenders but regarding cats makes heads. Yeah

1362
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:08,140
Vivo is just a small rock every scrawny rage makes me a lover even more all Vigo. Yeah Vigo my cats in Vigo after

1363
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:16,540
The the guy did did you know in door to the rings and the scene where he kicks the helmet he was screaming for real

1364
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:21,980
Do you want to know why he screamed out for real like that?

1365
01:53:22,380 --> 01:53:26,380
Because because he actually booked his to and yeah, and yes

1366
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:31,660
Did you name your cats after the lord of the rings? Of course I named my cats after the lord of the rings

1367
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:37,260
What else would I name them freaking bill and ben the flower pot man? No, I wouldn't

1368
01:53:39,340 --> 01:53:43,340
So yeah, my baby boy my baby girl and yes, I gave

1369
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:46,220
Gimli

1370
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:48,220
Well, yeah, I gave Gimli a boy's name technically

1371
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:51,580
But Gimli's got ginger on her butt. So

1372
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,460
Gimli ma homina

1373
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:58,540
Yeah, name them bill and ben the flower pot man, honestly

1374
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:01,420
Oh

1375
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:03,660
Holy crap, you just made me remember bill and ben

1376
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,900
JJ you've got a picture of me

1377
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:11,900
Thank you for the membership JJ. I appreciate it

1378
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:20,860
Just for all members who are watching the membership stream start next week, but I promise you I will throw you into the thick of it

1379
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:24,460
Um, and we'll have a lot of fun from there

1380
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:27,100
We'll take it from there

1381
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:33,260
Because this week is kind of locked in a little bit. We do have a collab again with me and all my girly

1382
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:37,180
You are an adorable goober. We love it

1383
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:41,740
Uh, yes

1384
01:54:41,740 --> 01:54:43,740
What's next Roseanne Jim?

1385
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:46,780
Yeah, I'm not gonna get any more uh putters

1386
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:49,900
after Viggo and

1387
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:54,940
Gimli I think um, I will probably have the biggest uh

1388
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:57,740
mental breakdown of my life

1389
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:04,300
Once they pass thankfully I have them very young they I think they're three years old

1390
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:10,940
Unfortunately due to the hoarder situation, they actually don't know what age my baby boy and baby girl are

1391
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:17,980
Like I was trying to get as much information that they had but they were just very honest and said like look we don't

1392
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:21,740
We don't actually have information on these babies

1393
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:30,140
Stroney, do you know if you get a cut of youtube premium membership watches? I absolutely do

1394
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:38,140
Um, if you pay for youtube or it used to be called youtube red, but if you do youtube premium

1395
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:40,380
um

1396
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:46,620
For however long you watch it like I get a percentage. So say you 100 watched me

1397
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:50,060
I get 100 of what you generate for

1398
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:54,780
Content creators does that make sense? It's the only percentage base to the best they can

1399
01:55:56,700 --> 01:56:00,940
I've noticed my favorite troopers dabble in theories must be one of those jokes from the universe

1400
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:05,900
Honestly, the universe will have a little funny joke for you. Like please if you're ever like

1401
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:10,220
Thinking oh, there's nothing interesting's gonna happen in my life

1402
01:56:10,300 --> 01:56:13,660
I assure you the universe is cooking something because I

1403
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:18,940
I am the biggest like don't support like pugs don't support

1404
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:24,380
French bulldogs like don't support munchkin cats don't do this or that

1405
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:30,540
And then the universe goes oh, by the way, here's a half munchkin. I'm like, oh, okay. I see how it is. I see how it is

1406
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:37,100
This is shooting is kind of hypnotic. Yeah, you can like see the balls move around in it

1407
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:39,980
It's just quite nice. I quite like it

1408
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:42,940
Wow

1409
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:49,660
It's like really therapeutic to like squish down into it honestly

1410
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:56,540
I'm not being like I'm I genuinely wholeheartedly mean it like it feels very nice to like squish something under my feet

1411
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:02,220
Go to go have fun with the rest of the stream. Congrats on monetization. Thank you

1412
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:06,300
Yes, please don't worry if you need go and I am going to redirect into the sheebie

1413
01:57:07,260 --> 01:57:13,580
Actually, is she be up right now? Hold on. I'm I'm leaning over

1414
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:20,700
She's live right now with another crabs treasure. Oh, yeah

1415
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:26,460
Apparently the music in that game is like so good, but it's a dark souls crab

1416
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:28,300
I thought it was like a fun little crab game

1417
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:31,740
I was gonna play until someone said it was like it's like dark souls and I'm like, bro

1418
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:36,220
If I can't if I can't tag in the refluence to help me that's a game. There's a point

1419
01:57:39,340 --> 01:57:48,220
Um, I will most likely do a talking stream membership one for next week just because there's so many

1420
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:53,020
Marshmallows, I can't really say but we can say

1421
01:57:56,380 --> 01:57:59,100
Yeah, I hope you enjoyed this fake ASMR roleplay
