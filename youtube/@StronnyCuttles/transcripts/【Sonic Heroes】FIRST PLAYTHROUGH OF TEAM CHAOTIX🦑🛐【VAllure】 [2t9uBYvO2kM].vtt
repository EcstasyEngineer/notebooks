WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Dancing if she says there's no audio in-game.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
What goes up must come down.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.000
Let me do a live chat.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Hold on, let me do a live chat.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Wait, there we go.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It felt tough, but it wouldn't work.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Good morning!

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Good morning.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Good evening, good afternoon.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I'm Strony Cuttles.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm supposed to be the hypnotist.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
And I've produced nothing hypnotist-wise, except that one live stream.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I've only slept two fucking hours.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
What a good song.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
That's a good song and that's a good show.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
That's not gonna stop me, okay?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
That's not gonna stop me.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
I'd like to apologise to any bleeding hearts who may be lurking.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh my, what's this sayfile?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Hmm, looks oddly familiar.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
If I click start, is it gonna remember that I did...

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Did I do Sonic?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Does it remember?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh wow, it did.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
I only slept two hours, cracks the can of cola for the fucking any ounce of the thingy.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
I can't believe this, remember?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Holy crap.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
So we've actually done Team Rose and Team Sonic.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Never done Team Chaotic.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
I've never done Dark, but we may actually have 100% sayfile, which I didn't expect.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So we are playing Team Chaotic.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Now I know it's really weird setup.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
There's like a big black gap in between me, but it's fine.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
We're just painting, don't you mind, painting.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
But we're jumping straight into...

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
It's here, it's here.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
We've got work.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
It's here, it's here.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I've heard good things about you.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
I would like to order your detective services.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, detective services.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
34 aspect ratio.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I actually have a layout that's 34.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Don't be silly.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
We never turned down work that pays.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
So I've never actually completed these guys past the power point, power station map.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Could you just show the whole abstract?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
You want me to be full body?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I missed the first minute of stront is over.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Oh no, I started early.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
See.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
So this is Team Chaotic.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
I'll talk a little bit in the background.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Hold on, how about I do my yapping?

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I actually went back in the binding of Isaacs dream because it was so good.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I team stamped it myself so people can enjoy me.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Freaking playing the loss.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I can't believe I did that and I don't know for any of you who didn't watch the binding of Isaacs.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I don't know why I'm frog blinking.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.800
I promise I'm not frog blinking in real life, okay?

03:36.680 --> 03:44.680
Frickin, I pulled the holy mantle card at the last possible second before delirium got me, okay?

03:45.640 --> 03:48.600
Before delirium zapped my butt cheeks.

03:49.160 --> 03:55.240
Um, you can literally hear me pull the card and then the crack on delirium.

03:55.240 --> 03:59.240
I didn't, I didn't realize I did it because it went so, it went by so quick.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.960
Three whole timestamps there.

04:03.160 --> 04:08.120
Um, but yeah, I, oh my god, fantastic.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.080
I cannot believe that Binding of Isaac Run happened.

04:11.800 --> 04:17.880
I don't know what streamer luck I'm getting and Beltrow and Isaac and all of it.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.400
Such a gamer honestly, an accidental gamer.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.880
Me like, should I break up Brimstone?

04:23.880 --> 04:26.840
Just waiting for you guys to tell me what to do.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.320
I was barely able to sleep after the excitement.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.160
I genuinely couldn't even process, like I looked back on it and I'm like,

04:33.160 --> 04:38.200
Stranny, Stranny for fuck's sake, you just, you just did delirium by accident.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.080
Like when I was lucky enough to even get access to the delirium portal.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.480
Um, I have my first Patreon audio upload this month.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.840
The next one is going to be coming out in two or three days.

04:50.840 --> 04:55.640
Bleeding Hearts, Azura's first one is going to come out after asleep.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.160
I'm so sorry for the delay.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.920
There's a lot of shit happening behind the scenes, but there's a fantastic, um,

05:02.120 --> 05:05.400
news that's going to be broken soon-ish.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.600
I can't break it yet, but once it gets broken,

05:10.600 --> 05:13.880
you'll understand like, oh, some stuff had to happen in the background.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.880
Oh, and, um, so yes, I am very excited about that.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.480
Sorry for the delay.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.640
Get it, delay, because it's French and you say, doodly.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.120
Yeah, that's right.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.720
I named them after French stuff.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.960
No, I'm not naming any other gen after them.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.040
So I'm sorry, but Fond de la Buzum will never be recreated and you'll never get it back.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.160
Um, huge news puns.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.640
But then again, yes, the stream went all according to the script.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.360
Well done, everybody.

05:38.360 --> 05:39.320
Stop it!

05:39.320 --> 05:42.600
People are going to think this is pre-recorded reflames.

05:43.400 --> 05:50.600
Um, I have a, I accidentally slipped into another ASMR collab with someone.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.800
I'm terrible.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.240
I've, I was going to announce,

05:53.240 --> 05:57.800
I've finally caught up with all scripts with all my ASMR collab, collab partners.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.920
And I, I fricking slipped and stumbled into another one.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.600
I don't know how I keep happening.

06:02.600 --> 06:07.960
Um, but, uh, I've got, I actually have collabs in August.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.080
I think with people outside of violour.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.120
Oh no, I have to be, I have to be social.

06:14.120 --> 06:19.720
I have to, I have to understand what people want and be nice and stuff.

06:20.600 --> 06:20.920
Yeah.

06:20.920 --> 06:21.880
Oh, we started early.

06:21.880 --> 06:22.760
Yes, I apologize.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.760
For any snowberries that might be lost,

06:24.760 --> 06:27.080
I just realized there was no background in game audio.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.000
Um, YouTube, please stop prompting me to insert ads.

06:31.000 --> 06:31.880
I'd appreciate it.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.480
Speaking of YouTube and ads,

06:33.480 --> 06:35.960
uh, all my streams are getting limited all of a sudden.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.840
And I'm like, I don't think I'm saying anything that outrageous.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.400
And I might be overly swearing because I do swear a lot.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.320
Mm, I do mean, um,

06:44.600 --> 06:47.000
mommy's normal now, honestly.

06:47.000 --> 06:47.720
Be gentle with yourselves.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.080
You've been top tier streaming for a while,

06:49.080 --> 06:51.640
luncheon and top tier company, company.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.920
I'm personally helpful in lots.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.680
You deserve all the praise and slack.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.960
Oh, give me that slack.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.160
Give me your slack refund.

06:59.160 --> 06:59.880
Oh, also me.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.560
I wonder why I keep getting limited ads.

07:01.560 --> 07:01.880
Hmm.

07:01.880 --> 07:02.280
Curious.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.360
Uh, curious, curious.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.880
Is there some sort of correlation?

07:05.880 --> 07:06.360
Hmm.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.080
Who knows?

07:07.640 --> 07:08.200
The Ys.

07:08.200 --> 07:08.680
Good morning.

07:08.680 --> 07:09.160
Good evening.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.040
Good afternoon.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.400
I'm Stewanyi.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.360
My voice is broken because I've overused it too much.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.960
My dad actually made a comment.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.440
He was like, your voice does not sound like your voice.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.800
But on stream, it sounds actually relatively fine.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.200
The microphone is covering how damaged my voice is.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.160
Um, I, yes, a Patreon audio came out.

07:30.120 --> 07:30.920
It's helped me.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.440
I mentioned this a little bit the other day

07:34.440 --> 07:39.320
on how good my accent is for ignore popcorn.

07:40.200 --> 07:46.360
Um, I have, I have a very good voice for ignore slash free use.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.720
And I've only just realized it.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.280
And I'm like, maybe I should dip into it a bit more.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.360
Because like, I have a really, uh, just do what you want.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.040
Let me just keep playing Sonic Heroes.

07:56.040 --> 07:56.440
Come on.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
I literally, it's terrible.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.040
But I'm like, oh no, I have a really good voice for it.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.800
Like, that's the thing I would have had to pick.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.280
Because I've been struggling with my accent.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.320
I feel quite, I feel quite self-conscious with my accent

08:09.320 --> 08:11.000
when I'm recording that kind of stuff.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.200
Because it sounds rather odd.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.120
I'm like, oh, a refline, were you then?

08:14.120 --> 08:15.560
Oh, do you like how that feels?

08:15.640 --> 08:17.800
Like, I'm struggling a wee bit.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.040
But, you know, nothing we can't overcome together.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.360
So I'm not going to try and get into my head too much.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.560
Because at the end of the day,

08:25.560 --> 08:27.320
we're making Shakespeare out here.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.160
We're making things to Shakespeare out here.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.240
Me and the boys.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.560
Um, quite unique, yes.

08:34.680 --> 08:39.240
Um, so I actually thought my dad was here longer.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.160
Um, than our original, I thought it was three weeks.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.320
Unless the days have gone by so quick.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.880
But he's actually getting shipped out in two weeks.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.320
Technical is dead if Johnny doesn't join the audio though.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.520
Your voice and accent are very cute.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.720
I love it. Oh, thank you very much.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.520
That's very kind.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.080
The music is a bit loud, by the way.

08:58.040 --> 08:58.760
What music?

08:59.400 --> 09:00.840
You shouldn't hear anything right now.

09:00.840 --> 09:01.800
Everything should be muted.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.640
It should be my voice and nothing more.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.200
Do you mean Sonic Heroes at the start when I was singing?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.040
I meant, I'm inclined to believe you.

09:10.040 --> 09:10.440
I am.

09:10.440 --> 09:11.000
It's true.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.400
I hear no music shipped out, bro.

09:13.400 --> 09:14.360
Yeah, he's getting shipped.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.960
As a Scot, I'm happy to have more Scot audios.

09:17.960 --> 09:18.920
That one bit him.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.840
That one was bit him, Swerdy.

09:24.040 --> 09:24.520
Thank you.

09:24.520 --> 09:24.920
Thank you.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.600
Wait, why is that?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.360
That is echoing.

09:28.360 --> 09:28.760
Hold on.

09:28.760 --> 09:29.560
What was the joke?

09:30.600 --> 09:31.640
Take what joke I said.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.360
Hold on.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.640
What was the joke?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.120
Go back.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.840
It was schizophrenia.

09:36.840 --> 09:37.880
I had another tab open.

09:37.880 --> 09:39.080
It started playing music.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.560
Oh dear.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.000
The refunds are losing it.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.200
Wait, what was the joke?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.640
I forgot what I said.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.520
The Shakespeare one.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.680
You know, we're not out here to make Shakespeare.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.760
We're just making stuff to shake your spirit.

09:55.480 --> 09:56.600
Oh, and it didn't play.

09:56.600 --> 09:56.840
Okay.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.280
It didn't play.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.000
Wait, why no?

09:59.000 --> 09:59.960
Why did you get?

09:59.960 --> 10:01.240
I got stage fright.

10:01.240 --> 10:01.960
Oh, there we go.

10:01.960 --> 10:02.360
Okay.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.320
It's fine.

10:03.320 --> 10:04.520
I got stage fright.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.960
Are you okay, little guy?

10:05.960 --> 10:07.080
Little stream deck.

10:07.080 --> 10:07.880
Are you all right there?

10:08.920 --> 10:10.600
He got shy.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.000
Oh, poor guy.

10:13.000 --> 10:13.400
Oh, great.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.680
I'm like, come on.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.320
Where's my cue?

10:15.960 --> 10:16.280
Okay.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.320
I'm going to slurp my tea,

10:17.320 --> 10:19.160
and then we'll get into shanic heroes.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.000
I've already lost the speed run.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.320
We're already 1 second, 0.98 miller or something.

10:29.480 --> 10:32.040
I'm a sleepy boy, sleepy baby,

10:32.040 --> 10:33.640
but I'm going to have fun.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.000
We're going to play Team Chaotic.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.560
I have never successfully as a child

10:37.560 --> 10:38.920
played Team Chaotic.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.640
The only team I played successfully

10:41.640 --> 10:44.040
was Rose, Team Rose,

10:44.040 --> 10:45.560
which is the easiest team.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.400
Now Chaotic's a bit different.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.440
They have the same map pool, etc.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.520
However, they do little side funny missions

10:54.520 --> 10:56.600
where you don't necessarily have to

10:56.600 --> 10:58.040
reach the end of the lobby.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.600
So we'll have a little...

11:00.600 --> 11:02.360
I never ended up playing most of the Sonic games.

11:02.360 --> 11:03.080
Neither did I.

11:03.080 --> 11:03.720
Please don't worry.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.320
This is literally the only...

11:05.320 --> 11:06.040
I played this.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.240
I played Sonic Unleashed,

11:07.240 --> 11:10.440
but I got stuck as a child in Sonic Unleashed.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.600
I don't know how young I was,

11:12.600 --> 11:15.400
but I was too young to comprehend

11:15.400 --> 11:16.600
what I was supposed to do,

11:16.600 --> 11:19.560
and I got stuck in the first 10 minutes

11:19.560 --> 11:20.600
of Sonic Unleashed.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.600
That's how young I was when I played it.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.040
I don't even know what year it came out,

11:24.040 --> 11:26.360
but I couldn't even figure out the freaking thing.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.440
You never finish this game as a child.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.080
Apparently it's a secret ending if we're 100% it,

11:31.080 --> 11:32.520
so we might return,

11:32.520 --> 11:33.880
because I do have a save file.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.400
I love Sonic Unleashed.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.840
I beat it like 2 years ago.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.200
Ah, Unleashed, Kino.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.400
Wait, so you never saw the final level,

11:41.400 --> 11:42.920
and it has the best OST ever?

11:43.960 --> 11:45.640
In Sonic Heroes?

11:46.360 --> 11:47.320
No, I've not.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.560
The only one I played was the worst one

11:51.560 --> 11:52.760
with all the loading screens.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.120
I don't know what that...

11:54.120 --> 11:55.880
I played Sonic 06.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.080
Small, strong, all we need.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.360
Little, baby, small and so.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.160
Yeah, you have to beat it all the teams.

12:01.160 --> 12:01.720
Oh, okay.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.800
Maybe we'll have a little visit back.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.680
I can't vouch for it.

12:06.680 --> 12:07.880
Yeah, right now, but...

12:07.880 --> 12:09.480
Hold on, let me slurp my tea again.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.320
You got all the emeralds?

12:13.320 --> 12:15.240
I purposely skip the keys.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.520
I don't even pick them up.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.640
I skip them,

12:17.640 --> 12:19.720
because I don't want to do those bonus levels

12:19.720 --> 12:21.400
with the freaking balloons.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.320
They annoy me so much.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.120
Oh, I think it was 2006.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.920
Big nostalgia time.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.560
Yes, Imi from Yumi Plus

12:33.560 --> 12:36.280
is also going on an absolute Sonic boonage.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.560
So if you're a Sonic fan,

12:37.560 --> 12:38.360
I kid you not,

12:38.360 --> 12:41.000
type in ImiYumiPlus.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.440
You're welcome.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.320
That's all I'm saying.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.680
Literally, out of the floodgates,

12:44.680 --> 12:46.600
and she's obsessed with Shadow,

12:46.600 --> 12:48.280
the hedgehog, bless her.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.120
She fucking goes,

12:54.120 --> 12:55.720
Coconuts for Shadow.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.360
Hi, woman.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.480
Hello, we playing.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.920
Sorry for starting early.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.280
I might have jump-scared somebody out.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.720
Whoa, you're too early.

13:01.720 --> 13:02.040
Look.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.320
If I remember correctly,

13:05.320 --> 13:05.960
when you get here,

13:05.960 --> 13:08.120
you aren't allowed to get one hit,

13:08.120 --> 13:08.920
or you perish.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.400
She's totally not down bad

13:11.400 --> 13:12.520
with Shadow for real, for real.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.640
Imi was so nice to me in the end.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.960
So if you didn't know,

13:17.960 --> 13:19.640
Imi is Ozzy.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.360
And I was like,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.040
please for the love of God,

13:22.040 --> 13:23.240
tell me you're in my city.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.320
I will literally do an off collab with you.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.160
You'll be the first person I off collab with.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.880
And she names the wrong bloody city.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.200
I'm like, bruv, it was a 50 fucking 50.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.720
And she's in the wrong one.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.680
She's in the wrong one.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.040
It was a 50 50.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.080
So I'm on the hunt

13:41.720 --> 13:42.520
for a freaking

13:43.240 --> 13:43.960
Melbourne

13:45.400 --> 13:46.200
bloody

13:46.200 --> 13:48.040
a streamer VTuber

13:48.040 --> 13:49.240
that's comfortable with me.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.560
Well, uncomfortable, you know,

13:51.560 --> 13:52.760
lead tubers in general.

13:53.960 --> 13:54.920
Who is Imi?

13:54.920 --> 13:56.520
Imi is from Yumi Plus.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.040
I collabed with her on Among Us,

13:58.040 --> 13:59.880
and I framed her twice in a row.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.000
I'm sorry about that.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.800
I do apologize.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.880
You were very easy to pick on

14:03.880 --> 14:04.520
in my defense.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.840
Hello, Momay reflinks.

14:08.840 --> 14:09.480
Good morning.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.480
Did you miss the chow garden?

14:13.480 --> 14:15.400
I never played that mini game.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.760
You know, never lucky.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.240
So I'm sure there's a Melbourneian VTuber

14:21.240 --> 14:21.960
that's crazy enough

14:21.960 --> 14:23.400
to let me come over to their house.

14:24.840 --> 14:25.560
I'll get it.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.240
I'll get there.

14:27.240 --> 14:27.880
Don't you worry.

14:27.880 --> 14:34.040
Imi is the plague doctor one with red and white.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.880
And I basically gaslit everyone

14:37.880 --> 14:39.560
into thinking it was her.

14:39.560 --> 14:43.000
And she got so she got so taken aback

14:43.000 --> 14:44.440
because no one's heard me.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.160
No, no one's actually heard me

14:47.160 --> 14:49.080
be aggressive or blamey.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.360
Like I've always come.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.400
I'm always chill.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.680
I'm always being chining.

14:52.680 --> 14:53.000
That's all.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.960
So I think everyone was like stunned

14:55.960 --> 14:57.800
that I came out of the gates on Among Us

14:57.880 --> 14:59.160
like it's her.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.280
Here's the here.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.240
It was the candlestick

15:01.240 --> 15:02.920
in the the ball yard room.

15:02.920 --> 15:03.480
Get her.

15:03.480 --> 15:03.800
Okay.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.120
And then we did because I got

15:06.120 --> 15:07.880
a wave that twice in the same lobby

15:07.880 --> 15:09.560
and then she be caught on

15:09.560 --> 15:11.080
to what the deal was going.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.560
So I had to start reversing it and stuff.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.480
Angry Strony was scary but hot.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.440
Well, I don't think anyone expected it.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.800
And I think I took everyone off guard.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.680
So everyone believed me

15:22.680 --> 15:23.880
for like the first two rounds

15:23.880 --> 15:25.000
and then everyone started to get

15:25.000 --> 15:25.960
real sussy of me.

15:28.760 --> 15:29.560
Mmm.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.520
The Scottish Cutfish Reacher for Bean Camp.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.800
Well, sometimes, okay.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.480
But yeah, I think I took everyone off guard

15:39.480 --> 15:40.120
by Among Us.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.600
But I'm currently working on a four-man

15:42.600 --> 15:44.840
collab with people outside of Vealur.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.360
And I'm like, I have to be social.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.240
I'm so scared.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.920
But at the same time, literally no one

15:48.920 --> 15:50.360
has rejected me so far.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.440
So I'm like, hi, I'm Strony.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.320
Do you want a collab?

15:53.320 --> 15:54.840
Here's the time and date.

15:54.840 --> 15:55.320
Show up.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.440
I'll show up in an hour early.

15:56.440 --> 15:56.760
Smile.

15:57.320 --> 16:01.400
Like, people, the way Veach over Twitter

16:01.400 --> 16:02.920
portray everyone being so shy

16:02.920 --> 16:04.200
and scared to talk to each other,

16:05.240 --> 16:06.920
it's actually stopping people

16:06.920 --> 16:08.680
from just straight-up collabing.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.960
You know, you don't have to know

16:09.960 --> 16:12.200
absolutely everything about each other to collab.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.040
I tell a crazy concept.

16:14.040 --> 16:18.280
I know absolutely earth-shattering news.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.920
But every time I've collabed with someone,

16:20.920 --> 16:22.920
they're like, yeah, no one asks me anything.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.440
And I'm like, oh, okay, well,

16:25.240 --> 16:26.920
I'm glad I could break the curse,

16:26.920 --> 16:29.240
because literally you just DM and be like,

16:29.240 --> 16:31.960
hi, I'm Strony from Vealur when I hang out.

16:31.960 --> 16:32.360
Smile.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.200
Need more Vealur Umi Plus collabs?

16:38.760 --> 16:41.400
Well, hold on to your hat, because August.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.080
Unfortunately, I can't really do any collabs this month

16:45.080 --> 16:47.080
because of Matt Dad situation.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.120
But once he goes home,

16:50.120 --> 16:53.880
I am then in a deficit of membership streams.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.200
Please don't think I'm neglecting membership streams.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.800
There's probably going to be like daily ones.

16:59.160 --> 17:02.680
Strony, you have just tremendously metaphorical ballbags.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.240
That's all.

17:05.000 --> 17:05.800
Oh, who goes there?

17:05.800 --> 17:08.440
That's exactly how I get all of the juice.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.120
Almost threw up there.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.960
If that was lovely first thing in the morning,

17:17.960 --> 17:18.760
let's not do that.

17:20.040 --> 17:20.520
Tisker.

17:21.480 --> 17:22.920
I also have a community post.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.480
If you have any words you want me to say in an ASMR,

17:25.480 --> 17:27.480
that's going to get recorded like first thing

17:28.040 --> 17:29.240
when my dad gets shipped,

17:29.240 --> 17:31.000
because when I get sad,

17:31.000 --> 17:32.280
I'll just throw myself into work.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.440
So don't be surprised when you see a bunch of ASMR

17:34.440 --> 17:35.640
come out right at the end of the month.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.280
A burpee ASMR.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.880
I've already made a burpee ASMR.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.000
It's on Patreon right now,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.520
but I can't put on YouTube yet,

17:42.520 --> 17:44.200
because I have a warning,

17:44.200 --> 17:47.160
and I don't know if YouTube is going to give me a strike for it.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.320
So I need to wait until the old strike is gone.

17:50.120 --> 17:50.920
Anonymous.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.280
Nine tenths.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.680
Why did you give me $30 for a burpee?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.640
Thank you. $30 Anonymous?

17:57.640 --> 17:58.440
Nine out of 10.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.160
How is that not...

17:59.160 --> 18:01.480
Did it need more base for you, sir?

18:02.200 --> 18:04.600
Sir, do you require more base with your burps?

18:05.560 --> 18:06.760
Sure, anything for you.

18:07.320 --> 18:07.560
All right.

18:07.560 --> 18:07.800
Okay.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.760
I'll finish my teeth.

18:08.760 --> 18:20.760
Okay.

18:24.440 --> 18:26.280
There are dollars based.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.440
Lol, restart my phone.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.040
I immediately agreed to a 10 out of 10 bell

18:30.040 --> 18:31.640
that you're going to wake up your dad for that one.

18:32.200 --> 18:32.600
Lol.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.440
A burp that transcends the mortal coil.

18:36.440 --> 18:40.120
Mm. Okay.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.640
Oh, I just remembered I was going to write a script for Sheebie,

18:45.640 --> 18:46.440
and I didn't.

18:46.440 --> 18:46.680
Shit.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.560
Is she ongoing?

18:53.800 --> 18:57.240
Oh, I just remembered I was supposed to do that right now.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.200
Okay, it's fine.

19:00.200 --> 19:00.840
I have time.

19:01.960 --> 19:02.760
I have time.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.120
I will teach the girls how to make scripts at a later date.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.200
For now, I will do it on their behalf.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.320
I will teach them their way.

19:09.320 --> 19:09.560
Okay.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.840
This is going to get loud.

19:10.840 --> 19:13.080
Jumpscare warning for the game sound.

19:14.200 --> 19:14.920
There we go.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.280
Oh my god.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.240
Wait, I can't control the camera.

19:26.360 --> 19:26.840
Let's go.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.560
Script writing stream instead.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.560
No, I can't seem to do it live anymore.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.600
I don't know what's going on.

19:32.600 --> 19:36.680
Look, it's a little hermit crab.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.800
And we're to collect 10 hermit crabs.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.200
Um, no louder please.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.000
Oh, I'm a bumblebee, so I pollinate the flower.

19:51.000 --> 19:51.240
Sorry.

19:51.240 --> 19:51.720
I saw.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.360
Oh, right.

19:52.360 --> 19:52.600
Okay.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.480
It's first thing in the morning.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.120
Be nice to me.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.040
You get the last one.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.200
No.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.840
I need a level up because so in Sonic Heroes,

20:08.840 --> 20:12.040
you have your strength type, you have your flying type,

20:12.040 --> 20:14.280
and you have your sneak for speed.

20:15.160 --> 20:20.760
I am a bias towards the flying one because this game,

20:20.760 --> 20:24.440
you can seriously like, oh my god, look at the hair of it as eyes.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.320
That's terrible.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.560
I love it more.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.840
The pollination mentioned on a little.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.520
What's that do a bubble?

20:39.560 --> 20:39.800
Right.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.760
We're not going for the key.

20:40.760 --> 20:41.800
I've had enough key.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.480
Why does Gator sound like Uncle Ruckus?

20:44.200 --> 20:45.160
Who's Uncle Ruckus?

20:45.160 --> 20:45.800
Am I being dumb?

20:47.960 --> 20:48.280
Wow.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.680
So we are literally our mission isn't to like kill all the robots,

20:52.680 --> 20:53.240
get to the end.

20:53.240 --> 20:56.120
It's to collect these little adorable hermit crabs.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.080
Hey, so let's get to it.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.360
Is the cook?

21:00.360 --> 21:04.440
Oh god, I've forgotten what button the ultimate is.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.520
It says press Z, but there's no Z.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.840
I must be a bumper.

21:08.840 --> 21:09.880
Surely it's a bumper.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.200
There's a little army club.

21:14.200 --> 21:14.600
Hello.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.440
I have no idea.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.800
Oh no, I can't be.

21:21.800 --> 21:22.360
All right.

21:22.360 --> 21:22.860
Okay.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.320
Oh god, I love this game so much.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.160
If you didn't know.

21:33.160 --> 21:35.960
Wait, was there?

21:35.960 --> 21:37.560
No, there wasn't a hermit crab on that one.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.040
That's fine.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.320
Um, probably right bumper.

21:44.440 --> 21:45.560
Oh, not vector.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.200
Oh wait, those are level ups.

21:52.200 --> 21:52.440
Okay.

21:52.440 --> 21:53.160
That's good.

21:53.160 --> 21:58.360
Um, but yes, I apologize if this is just absolutely trash string

21:58.360 --> 22:00.040
because I can't string a sentence together.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.520
The truth is I didn't sleep.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.560
I, so my dad took me to Bunnens.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.080
So I've got a, I'm going to change the cats.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.480
Oh, there's a wee hermit crab.

22:11.480 --> 22:14.840
I need to change the cat litter box after this strum.

22:15.880 --> 22:16.920
Oh god, I go up.

22:17.560 --> 22:18.520
What happens if I go up?

22:20.760 --> 22:21.480
Is that up here?

22:21.480 --> 22:23.320
There is there a hermit crab up here?

22:23.320 --> 22:23.800
Be honest.

22:23.800 --> 22:28.520
No, go and get the rest.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.680
Hey, so yeah, if I'm quiet, please don't think it's big.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.720
Are you okay game?

22:34.760 --> 22:35.080
Okay.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.880
Please don't think it's because I'm like being a stinky streamer

22:39.880 --> 22:41.000
and don't want to talk.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.280
It's because I don't have, I didn't know you had a flamethrower.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.600
It's because I'm dumb and I didn't sleep,

22:46.600 --> 22:48.280
but I'm going to get loads of sleep very shortly.

22:48.280 --> 22:48.840
So don't worry.

22:51.000 --> 22:51.640
Run.

22:53.800 --> 22:54.600
Where's the strong stream?

22:54.600 --> 22:55.640
How could it be trash?

22:55.640 --> 22:56.600
You're too nice to me.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.920
Oh, we have super fast speeds.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.080
Wow.

23:05.320 --> 23:05.560
Oh.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.320
Oh, you didn't see that.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.040
That is terrible.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.000
You think I was being new to this game or something?

23:19.560 --> 23:21.480
No, I'm no, I'm just rubbish.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.840
Did you enjoy your steak dinner?

23:22.840 --> 23:26.440
No, I didn't end up having it because my dad took me to a cafe

23:27.480 --> 23:29.240
and I had like avocado and toast.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.480
I know make it more Aussie kidney if I tried.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.640
And then we ended up no having the steaks because both of us were full.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.760
So we're having chicken instead because we marinated chicken.

23:41.320 --> 23:41.880
Right.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.720
Wait for the platforms to load.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.840
Don't be silly.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.080
Okay.

23:47.080 --> 23:47.640
There we go.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.120
Hold on.

23:49.000 --> 23:49.640
Hold on.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.440
I need to wait for these platforms to load.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.160
Okay.

23:56.040 --> 23:56.760
What did we do?

23:56.760 --> 23:57.800
We didn't do anything.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.160
Oh, there's a we fly there.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.000
How is the world domination going?

24:07.000 --> 24:07.960
Absolutely terrible.

24:07.960 --> 24:11.640
I'm supposed to be the hypnosis and I don't have one hypnosis freaking role play out.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.640
But I promise, I promise I will cook.

24:13.640 --> 24:14.440
Just let me cook.

24:14.440 --> 24:14.680
Okay.

24:14.680 --> 24:15.720
I just need some time.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.120
I just need some time.

24:18.120 --> 24:18.280
Bye.

24:18.280 --> 24:18.680
Welcome.

24:21.080 --> 24:21.480
And we.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.440
No.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.640
I thought we were a I thought the map had reset there.

24:30.120 --> 24:30.440
Whoa.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.080
Are you serious?

24:33.080 --> 24:33.960
Oh, okay.

24:33.960 --> 24:36.600
I thought that was bad news, but it's actually not that bad news.

24:37.320 --> 24:37.560
Right.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.360
We just need one more little hermit crab wherever they are.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.520
Is there one under here?

24:43.800 --> 24:44.360
There it is.

24:44.360 --> 24:44.840
I can see it.

24:44.840 --> 24:45.320
I can see it.

24:45.320 --> 24:45.720
I saw it.

24:45.720 --> 24:46.520
I saw a pixel.

24:47.880 --> 24:48.520
It's here.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.560
I see it.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.200
Give me it.

24:50.840 --> 24:51.400
We did it.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.080
Yeah.

24:53.080 --> 24:53.400
See it.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.520
Mission one's already done.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.720
Avocado on toast is an Aussie thing.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.160
So there's been a stereotype.

24:59.160 --> 25:03.080
Well, they say like that's why you folk can't afford a house is because they're eating avocado

25:03.080 --> 25:03.960
toast and it's like rub.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.320
Mummy likes her hypnosis role plays like her steak.

25:07.320 --> 25:07.960
Well done.

25:08.520 --> 25:12.120
Well, I actually have a four part series that's going on Twitter.

25:12.120 --> 25:16.120
I'm need to buy premium Twitter.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.680
Elon's got me and bent over a barrel right now.

25:19.640 --> 25:20.120
Okay.

25:20.120 --> 25:20.600
An E.

25:22.440 --> 25:23.880
Stop fooling around.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.320
I like the bumblebee's voice.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.600
Stop fooling around.

25:27.400 --> 25:27.720
Um,

25:29.640 --> 25:30.920
it's a four part series.

25:30.920 --> 25:31.160
Yeah.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.040
I was just going to.

25:32.040 --> 25:35.160
So originally it was to go on Patreon, but it's against us.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.760
So it's not going on Patreon.

25:39.000 --> 25:39.240
Okay.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.400
We need to rescue a chocoto.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.200
Reeflings forced Johnny to eat a medium steak.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.640
No, no.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.520
Why?

25:48.520 --> 25:49.400
Why not well done?

25:50.360 --> 25:52.840
I didn't want, I didn't want it moving.

25:53.800 --> 25:57.720
And I didn't want the thought of like little worms in it either.

25:57.720 --> 26:02.040
So I said what I said, but if you cook it well done, the worms can't survive.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.560
The we eggs can't survive in it.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.120
If it's a contaminated.

26:09.480 --> 26:13.640
I said what I said, I don't know why well done steak is so controversial.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.120
I love when there's a risk of having worms in my steak.

26:18.120 --> 26:18.600
No.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.400
Said no one ever.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.680
No one wants that.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.000
Okay.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.480
Our objective is just to get to the chocoto.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.520
Chocoto?

26:24.520 --> 26:25.880
Chocoto.

26:25.880 --> 26:26.840
Chocoto.

26:26.840 --> 26:27.400
At the end.

26:27.400 --> 26:27.800
Oh my God.

26:27.800 --> 26:28.120
Cream.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.000
Speaking of cream, I cream up.

26:31.000 --> 26:31.880
The no stop.

26:31.880 --> 26:32.520
That's not funny.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.800
How pink does she think medium is?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.480
Well, it's still pink in that.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.000
So that means it's fucking raw.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.960
Okay.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.000
I'm starting to catch on to the game.

26:55.960 --> 27:01.160
That like helps you level up if you look for the balloons.

27:02.440 --> 27:06.600
Only took me how many places to finally get that point across.

27:11.160 --> 27:11.720
Stunning.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.280
I love the poses.

27:15.160 --> 27:16.520
Starting wrong with some pink.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.240
I know that shit bubble gum pink.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.640
Do you remember when that was fucking everywhere?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.680
Oh my God.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.840
I know that's bubble gum pink.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.120
That's like, I know your knobs are different color than your skin.

27:30.120 --> 27:30.760
What the fuck?

27:31.400 --> 27:33.800
Because what would the equivalent for a guy be on that?

27:36.760 --> 27:38.840
Steak doesn't have parasites, that's fish.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.160
Yeah, you want my parasites?

27:43.880 --> 27:45.400
Wait, I can't reach.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.680
Oh, I was gonna say I'm too tall.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.520
Stunning.

27:48.520 --> 27:51.240
That pink is my glove in.

27:51.240 --> 27:51.800
Munkos.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:55.880 --> 27:56.760
I wasn't paying attention.

27:56.760 --> 27:57.400
Hold on.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.120
I'm popping my...

28:01.880 --> 28:02.360
Thank you.

28:03.720 --> 28:04.360
Oh my God.

28:04.360 --> 28:05.800
I loved the little bumblebee's voice.

28:05.800 --> 28:06.280
Sorry.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.960
Is it because I can kinda mimic it?

28:07.960 --> 28:10.200
In my head, I sound like the bumblebee when I do that,

28:10.200 --> 28:11.880
but I bet you I sound nothing like it.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.560
No, but I want to taste your fish regardless.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.400
I don't think there's a mimic...

28:17.400 --> 28:21.640
Well, I thought guys was a...

28:21.640 --> 28:24.120
Oh, I just used my ultima.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.240
And you're like...

28:29.320 --> 28:34.120
Your skin, wink, wink, is like slightly different color?

28:35.320 --> 28:37.480
Like it's darker than what your skin color is?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.720
Am I going crazy or is that not real?

28:39.720 --> 28:40.680
Did I make that up?

28:42.840 --> 28:44.920
I'm like trying to be like...

28:45.800 --> 28:46.440
I'm like...

28:46.440 --> 28:47.480
Okay, no, it's real.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.200
Okay, it's real.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.040
Okay, okay, okay.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.400
No, that's true.

28:55.400 --> 28:55.800
Slightly.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.600
Huh, I never know if...

28:57.480 --> 28:58.280
Yeah, it's darker.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.800
Everyone unanimously getting their tentacle art right now

29:01.800 --> 29:03.000
just to confirm or deny.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.040
We're milling and milling and...

29:08.360 --> 29:11.160
Okay, we're already in two missions.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.240
We're already on Dr. Eggman.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.160
It's darker because it's shrinkable.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.760
Shony, you're the first person I've ever had in 20 players

29:26.760 --> 29:28.200
two years of being an Islamic fantasy.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.320
They like Charmy's voice.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.120
Oh wait, the bee's called Charmy.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.560
Bee, bee, bee, Charmy.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.080
It's so cute.

29:41.720 --> 29:49.880
Oh no, he didn't come down here.

29:49.880 --> 29:50.280
Oops.

29:51.080 --> 29:51.720
Oh, he did.

29:52.840 --> 29:53.560
No, he didn't.

29:55.080 --> 29:55.800
Please don't hit me.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.280
Oopsies.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.120
I thought he was supposed to slow down.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.040
Now, I missed that one up.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.560
Sorry, I went too far ahead.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.320
I'm a silly bee.

30:07.560 --> 30:13.560
A bumblebee for Gen 2 confirmed purely on the basis of the Sonic Hero character?

30:13.560 --> 30:13.800
Yes.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.600
And what are you going to do about it?

30:16.600 --> 30:16.760
Huh?

30:16.760 --> 30:17.560
Are you going to fart?

30:17.560 --> 30:18.200
Are you going to cry?

30:21.400 --> 30:24.200
Oh, I'm getting smoked.

30:24.200 --> 30:24.760
Hold on a minute.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.800
I'm getting smoked here.

30:25.800 --> 30:26.760
Hold on a minute.

30:26.760 --> 30:27.400
Right, here we go.

30:28.200 --> 30:28.840
Hey, here we go.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.280
We camping.

30:31.880 --> 30:32.840
Get him, boys.

30:32.840 --> 30:33.320
Get him.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.200
Do not move.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.320
What are we doing?

30:37.320 --> 30:37.800
No, no, no.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.200
Don't move.

30:38.200 --> 30:38.920
I'm not done yet.

30:38.920 --> 30:39.720
I'm not done yet.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.120
Hold on.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.320
Oh, oh, he's spraying.

30:43.880 --> 30:44.840
Don't be so rude.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.240
Hold on.

30:45.240 --> 30:45.640
I'm not.

30:45.640 --> 30:46.200
Hold on.

30:46.200 --> 30:46.600
Hold on.

30:46.600 --> 30:47.640
I'm too slow.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.080
Yeah, I was going to say I'm too slow.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.760
Oh, he throws a little ninja star.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.880
I never even noticed that.

30:53.080 --> 30:53.800
All right, hold on.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.400
Wait, come stop here so I can beat you up again.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.320
No, I've done it again.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.520
How did I keep doing that?

31:00.520 --> 31:00.920
Draft.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.640
I'm being a silly belly, clearly.

31:04.200 --> 31:05.720
Oh, wait.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.480
I can attack them while he's moving.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.440
Hold on a minute.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.160
Hold on a minute.

31:09.160 --> 31:09.960
We can do damage.

31:09.960 --> 31:10.920
I repeat, we can do damage.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.320
Can I do this and they'll attack him for me?

31:15.960 --> 31:17.320
Oh, what?

31:17.320 --> 31:18.120
I don't know this.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.600
Wait, why am I such a silly belly?

31:20.600 --> 31:21.960
What happens if I use my ultimate?

31:23.480 --> 31:24.200
Can I use it now?

31:24.840 --> 31:26.120
Can I use it right against him?

31:27.160 --> 31:28.120
I'm not.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.080
I'm going burst.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.440
Did that work?

31:45.080 --> 31:46.200
Did I block the game out?

31:48.360 --> 31:50.520
Oh, okay.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.280
Maybe don't use your ultimate against them.

31:52.280 --> 31:54.440
I'm not sure it's going to make the game go funny.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.880
So many things confirmed from Gen2.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.320
It's going to be a big gen.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.880
Bruh, I cannot wait until you guys actually see

31:59.880 --> 32:01.240
what did get accepted.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.160
I have been messing around with you guys

32:03.240 --> 32:05.640
so much being like, this got accepted in Gen2.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.200
This didn't.

32:06.200 --> 32:06.920
This got denied.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.200
But this got accepted.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.640
Oh, I'll take this suggestion.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.120
I'll do this.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.320
I'll further develop that.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.560
I cannot wait for you guys to be strong

32:13.560 --> 32:15.160
and you absolute troll.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.440
I've literally said no to stuff that isn't.

32:21.080 --> 32:22.520
We have here waiting for the trailer.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.320
Transformer in Gen2, you stinker.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.040
Oh, come on.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.000
You have to let me troll.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.320
Let's go.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.120
What's the mission?

32:39.640 --> 32:39.960
Okay.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.160
We're to destroy all the enemies in the safe.

32:43.160 --> 32:43.800
We can do that.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.400
Oh, is there any other?

32:51.960 --> 32:53.800
I can't control the camera at all.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.440
So if there's an enemy behind me and I've missed it,

32:56.440 --> 32:56.840
my bad.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.080
Gonna be honest, chief.

32:59.080 --> 32:59.640
It's my bad.

33:04.120 --> 33:04.680
Here we go.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.680
I don't know how to tell if I've done all the enemies.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.600
So we've got a number at least.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.400
Oh, I don't want bubble.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.200
I want level up.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.920
So we can...

33:18.200 --> 33:18.520
Wait.

33:19.800 --> 33:20.280
Oh, no.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.200
Are they going to go back up?

33:22.200 --> 33:24.520
I need to use espion to get up there.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.080
I think his name is espion.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.680
Are those things going to come back up?

33:28.680 --> 33:28.920
Okay.

33:28.920 --> 33:29.240
They are.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.440
They are very slowly.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.480
They're coming back up.

33:31.480 --> 33:32.280
Pfft.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.280
We know you well enough that you're lying

33:38.280 --> 33:40.520
and we let you get away with it.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.000
It wasn't buggering thin fly transformation

33:43.000 --> 33:43.640
thundershot.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.800
Just doesn't do direct damage at 0 or 1.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.640
They'll find enemies still take damage.

33:47.640 --> 33:48.840
I don't know.

33:48.840 --> 33:49.320
Okay.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.760
One, two, three, four, five.

33:54.040 --> 33:54.360
Okay.

33:56.440 --> 33:56.840
Wah.

33:57.480 --> 34:00.840
I don't like those tanks.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.640
They scare me.

34:08.600 --> 34:08.920
Wait.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.920
Does that count as destroying them?

34:10.920 --> 34:11.880
That does not count.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.240
It's just frozen the guys.

34:14.280 --> 34:14.680
Oh, no.

34:14.680 --> 34:14.920
Wait.

34:14.920 --> 34:15.560
Hold on.

34:15.560 --> 34:16.680
Did the number just go up there?

34:16.680 --> 34:17.560
Am I making that up?

34:18.840 --> 34:21.480
I am pushing against the current as hard as I can.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.680
I think I'm going to have to wait for them to fly back up.

34:25.640 --> 34:27.000
Are they actually down there?

34:27.800 --> 34:28.200
No.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.320
They must have been destroyed.

34:29.320 --> 34:29.880
There's no way.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.280
If we messed up the game,

34:33.320 --> 34:35.480
so this is where I got stuck as a child

34:35.480 --> 34:37.240
and I've not gone any further than this.

34:40.760 --> 34:41.240
Fly.

34:41.240 --> 34:41.880
So it's fly.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.120
Okay.

34:42.120 --> 34:42.680
I'll fly.

34:42.680 --> 34:43.320
I'll trust it.

34:45.560 --> 34:50.040
I'm going to level up the B fully just because.

34:50.040 --> 34:54.840
Oh, there's two enemies here.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.840
I just want to make sure I get them.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.680
I don't want to like move on by accident.

35:02.200 --> 35:02.680
I'm stuck.

35:03.320 --> 35:03.720
Oh God.

35:03.720 --> 35:04.600
I'm so bad at this.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.320
I'm so sorry.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.680
It's because there's a pit.

35:09.720 --> 35:11.000
If it wasn't Haram,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.520
I would bet $100 that Gen 2 includes a slime or a horse girl.

35:14.840 --> 35:15.320
Mm.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.960
Is it because I've made such a deal

35:19.960 --> 35:21.800
about like not liking slime girls?

35:21.800 --> 35:24.440
I wonder if that's why I think that.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.400
Is there anything in here?

35:25.400 --> 35:26.200
No, there's a switch.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.320
What does the switch do?

35:27.320 --> 35:30.120
Oh, it lets me access to the level up.

35:30.120 --> 35:30.600
I'll take it.

35:36.120 --> 35:36.680
Okay.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.080
One, two, three, four.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.360
31 out of 85.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.200
Wait, we've actually still got quite a bit

35:44.680 --> 35:44.760
to go.

35:44.760 --> 35:45.560
Is that a yes?

35:46.120 --> 35:48.040
No, I'm not confirming anything.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.840
I'm just saying that I've been an absolute troll

35:50.840 --> 35:52.760
and I've said yes to stuff that isn't happening

35:52.760 --> 35:56.360
and I've said no to stuff that is happening.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.480
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

35:59.480 --> 36:01.000
I should have done that on SP1.

36:01.000 --> 36:01.480
My bad.

36:04.760 --> 36:05.800
Ext interact.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.560
Slime cinch.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.600
Okay, hold on a minute.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.040
I'm not sure how much I can actually

36:12.040 --> 36:14.360
hide my real disdain for some of the suggestions.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.400
We are going to have a carry on next week

36:17.400 --> 36:19.560
and I'm going to draw your gen 2 suggestions

36:19.560 --> 36:24.920
because I'm about to get all the concepts given,

36:25.720 --> 36:26.680
which by...

36:29.080 --> 36:30.440
Oh, they're falling from the sky.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.760
Oh, yeah, from the sky.

36:35.320 --> 36:35.560
Oh.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.320
Okay, don't, no, don't, don't attack.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.360
I guess...

36:42.360 --> 36:44.120
Wait, SP1 just...

36:47.000 --> 36:48.520
He just turned it on his arse?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.040
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.000
No, go back.

36:53.000 --> 36:53.800
No, go back.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.560
Go back right now.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.360
I saw that.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.120
What am I shooting at?

37:02.040 --> 37:03.160
Wait, how do I get back up?

37:04.200 --> 37:05.080
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.200
Let's...

37:06.200 --> 37:06.520
No!

37:07.960 --> 37:08.360
Ah.

37:09.880 --> 37:10.680
Okay, hold on.

37:10.680 --> 37:14.360
If I hover and then shoot, surely.

37:14.360 --> 37:14.680
Yes.

37:16.040 --> 37:16.520
One more.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.840
M-m-more skills.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.480
Level 3, honing attack.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.280
Homing attack is the tornado.

37:26.280 --> 37:26.600
Wow.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.000
Is there an enemy down here?

37:29.720 --> 37:29.960
No.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.280
I'm just getting trolled, right?

37:32.280 --> 37:35.080
Bumblebee time, sweet little bumblebee.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.160
I know what you want to be.

37:38.040 --> 37:41.160
I'm out of range.

37:41.960 --> 37:42.520
Oh, man.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.840
I'm being super safe with the bumblebee.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.640
I love him.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.960
And it means I can do damage from...

37:49.960 --> 37:51.960
Oh, well, that looks like a hymn.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.040
Oh, I almost missed it.

38:01.640 --> 38:02.760
Oh, no, I didn't.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.000
Right, so can you destroy the tank now?

38:05.880 --> 38:07.080
He can do it on his own.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.440
He doesn't need, like, health.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.440
That's amazing.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.120
All the girls will be muppified.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.960
Toma keys, count your days.

38:13.960 --> 38:14.520
Toma...

38:14.520 --> 38:18.600
If you didn't see it, Toma keys did it to Zura.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.680
I have never interacted with Toma keys,

38:20.680 --> 38:22.680
but count your days, my girl.

38:22.680 --> 38:23.560
I'm coming for you.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.880
You muppify in my...

38:25.880 --> 38:28.760
Do you know how much money I spent on Zura's design

38:29.800 --> 38:30.920
in her model?

38:30.920 --> 38:32.600
And you come along and muppify?

38:35.560 --> 38:37.880
Oh, it's absolutely hilarious.

38:37.880 --> 38:38.600
I love seeing it.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.160
Tea bag in the crap out of it.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.200
Please drop down.

38:42.200 --> 38:42.840
Drop.

38:42.840 --> 38:43.000
Drop.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.200
Drop down.

38:44.200 --> 38:44.760
There you go.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.520
Muppet strongy win.

38:48.520 --> 38:49.640
Toma, you better not.

38:51.720 --> 38:52.360
A muppet?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.600
Why do I look like a muppet to you?

38:55.720 --> 38:57.880
Two seconds later, it's muppified.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.120
Right.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.760
It's telling me to use him to aim.

39:02.760 --> 39:03.080
Okay.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.960
So, no, that was X.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.440
I was wrong.

39:10.920 --> 39:11.240
What?

39:13.400 --> 39:14.680
Does that don't work?

39:14.680 --> 39:15.880
How does that shoot?

39:15.880 --> 39:17.400
Are you squidding me right now?

39:17.400 --> 39:18.680
I said I'm working.

39:18.680 --> 39:19.080
Tiny.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.520
Sorry, I'm late, strongy.

39:20.520 --> 39:22.280
How's it going so far?

39:22.280 --> 39:23.400
It's going good.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.680
We are playing...

39:24.680 --> 39:26.360
Don't apologize for being late.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.200
I actually started 10 minutes early,

39:28.200 --> 39:29.400
which you're not supposed to do,

39:29.400 --> 39:31.800
but I did it because I'm such a naughty VTuber.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.760
We're playing Team Chaotic.

39:36.760 --> 39:40.200
We're doing ones that I'm not too familiar with.

39:42.600 --> 39:45.240
I've never won on him before on this team.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.320
But I'm trying my best,

39:49.320 --> 39:50.840
and that's the most important thing.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.840
But thank you for the tip, Tiny Spine.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.640
Muppet allure.

39:57.640 --> 39:58.200
Stop it.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.680
Stop saying such thing.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.360
Are you trying to upset me on purpose?

40:02.360 --> 40:06.600
Power is control of the canyon.

40:09.400 --> 40:09.960
Ah!

40:09.960 --> 40:10.680
Did I just hurt?

40:10.680 --> 40:11.880
Oh, I didn't hurt myself there.

40:13.080 --> 40:16.120
I didn't have fun with the later levels in this game mode.

40:19.160 --> 40:19.640
Oh well.

40:20.440 --> 40:23.240
Okay, we're at 73 of 85 enemies.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.280
Okay, okay.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.280
I have no idea if we've missed any.

40:26.280 --> 40:27.720
I have a feeling we probably have.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.480
Team Chaotic hurt me.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.720
Oh no, that picked like the most awkward team.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.520
I have no idea if there's like secret enemies behind me.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.840
I feel like there probably is.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.160
I'll handle it.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.040
Okay, there we go.

40:51.960 --> 40:52.440
Wow.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.000
Right, we'll do this so we can shoot at the guy.

40:57.640 --> 40:58.840
Use the X button.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.320
Use the X button.

41:02.520 --> 41:05.080
Do we need to turn back for the railings?

41:07.320 --> 41:09.960
Surely they wouldn't put an enemy on the railings,

41:09.960 --> 41:11.560
like down the other sides.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.760
No, this game is very friendly.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.480
Oh wow, we just killed three.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.520
Wait, we've got four more.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.960
Please tell me there's four at the.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.360
Whoa, I see a little hidden thing to the left.

41:23.160 --> 41:23.960
Did you see that?

41:25.240 --> 41:26.760
Team Sonic is normal mode.

41:26.760 --> 41:27.240
Oh no.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.200
Have I missed two?

41:32.840 --> 41:35.640
We got a complete Peer League before we get map attack.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.160
You're not getting it.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.880
Chaotic is mission mode.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.880
Thank you for the tip, Broly legend.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.040
Oh, thank goodness we did it.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.760
I actually have come.

41:46.760 --> 41:48.120
Oh, right.

41:48.120 --> 41:48.440
Hold on.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.160
Let's just nuke them.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.000
I think we're actually going to do it.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.920
I've never gone past this point

41:54.920 --> 41:56.920
because I got stuck on this one in childhood.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.280
I don't know what I got stuck on though.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.720
That seems really straightforward.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.200
I think Emelur.

42:07.960 --> 42:10.280
Emelur sounds like custom manure.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.120
The P and Peeler stood for puppets this entire time.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.280
It's up to Azura.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.280
The Peeler allegations are complete.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.280
It's not up to me.

42:22.280 --> 42:23.240
It's up to Azura.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.840
I'm just on standby, okay?

42:26.840 --> 42:27.880
I'm on standby.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.080
Now you're not child anymore.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.440
You can fight your inner demons.

42:35.560 --> 42:37.720
Right, there are the Golden Turtle robots.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.640
The turtles control the system.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.160
Sorry, I'm talking over the literal commentary.

42:43.160 --> 42:46.040
We're to find and destroy Golden Turtles.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.600
Okay, Hydration Tech replays.

42:54.200 --> 42:55.800
That's not a Golden Turtle though.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.840
Okay, I don't want a key.

43:00.440 --> 43:00.840
Let's go.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.800
If you do it, I'll do it.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.080
Type of friend.

43:05.080 --> 43:05.880
Pretty much, yeah.

43:07.400 --> 43:11.480
I was so surprised by the girls when we handed over the Twires.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.440
But I'm like, hold on a minute.

43:12.440 --> 43:13.480
You guys are onto something.

43:16.840 --> 43:17.720
Use thundershoot.

43:20.040 --> 43:21.320
What team did you like best?

43:21.320 --> 43:24.280
Rose, because I'm rubbish at games.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.840
And it's a girl team.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.960
And I might be a girl.

43:29.960 --> 43:30.600
And I don't know.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.640
I just kind of...

43:31.640 --> 43:33.320
Oh, why is that locked up?

43:35.640 --> 43:36.920
Why is that locked up?

43:40.360 --> 43:42.520
Oh. Charming.

43:43.720 --> 43:45.000
Oh, someone leveled up.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.680
A crocodile leveled up.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.440
I need another one though.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.120
I need it for the flight.

43:50.120 --> 43:51.480
My charming bumblebee.

43:51.480 --> 43:52.840
I love my charming bumblebee.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.280
Come on.

43:56.280 --> 43:59.080
No, he's like shocking them as they come down.

43:59.080 --> 44:00.680
Estrani's a girl.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.560
I know.

44:01.560 --> 44:03.080
It's absolutely horrifying.

44:03.800 --> 44:06.360
Is there like a secret level up over here, please?

44:06.360 --> 44:07.800
Wait, there actually is.

44:08.520 --> 44:09.720
Oh, no.

44:09.720 --> 44:10.680
I thought there was a level up.

44:10.680 --> 44:11.800
Okay, we've been lied to.

44:12.680 --> 44:16.040
Unconfirmed being a girl allegation.

44:16.040 --> 44:17.000
Shock and behavior.

44:18.120 --> 44:19.000
Shock and behavior.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.720
No, go for the other guy.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.760
No, the other guy.

44:22.760 --> 44:23.800
He's right there.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.520
Oh, they take damage if they fall down.

44:28.440 --> 44:29.880
Why does he keep getting the level up?

44:29.880 --> 44:31.080
Give it to the flight.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.160
Stop giving it to the strength guy.

44:38.520 --> 44:39.400
How do I kill it?

44:41.480 --> 44:41.960
You know what?

44:41.960 --> 44:43.960
I'm gonna just kick and then get my ultimate

44:43.960 --> 44:44.600
and then do this.

44:44.920 --> 44:49.640
Look, it's a little bit cheesy doodling,

44:49.640 --> 44:51.160
but it works.

44:51.160 --> 44:51.560
Okay.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.720
And if it works, who am I to complain?

44:55.720 --> 44:56.200
Thank you.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.880
Am I supposed to do the stripy?

44:59.880 --> 45:01.400
Oh, it's a switched open up.

45:02.200 --> 45:02.920
Oh, right.

45:02.920 --> 45:03.160
Okay.

45:03.160 --> 45:05.560
That makes a lot more sense than I was like, hmm.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.720
Death by bad singing.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.400
Am I supposed to go up?

45:13.400 --> 45:14.600
Is this one of them hidden things?

45:14.600 --> 45:15.800
Oh, it bloody is.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.760
I hate when there's like a path

45:20.760 --> 45:22.280
and you're not sure which one's the right one.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.240
Oh, well, there you go.

45:23.960 --> 45:24.200
Wait.

45:26.280 --> 45:27.640
Is he gonna get me?

45:27.640 --> 45:28.920
Can you aim for the...

45:28.920 --> 45:29.240
Can you...

45:30.840 --> 45:31.800
God, right.

45:31.800 --> 45:32.360
I'm just gonna...

45:35.800 --> 45:36.200
Hello?

45:39.880 --> 45:40.120
Yeah.

45:40.120 --> 45:41.560
No wonder you fell off the map.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.280
What was that?

45:43.800 --> 45:44.760
What was that?

45:44.760 --> 45:46.680
I mean, what even was that?

45:46.680 --> 45:49.880
I think the game kicks Charmin

45:49.880 --> 45:52.120
all the way in place of like Vespion

45:52.120 --> 45:53.800
when I threw him or whatever his freaking name is.

45:54.440 --> 45:55.400
That was bizarre.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.040
I'm just gonna fly and...

45:58.920 --> 46:00.840
Oh, no, I lost all my charge.

46:03.960 --> 46:04.360
I don't...

46:05.240 --> 46:06.360
Do you want to kick those?

46:07.800 --> 46:09.880
No, I'm scared to like kick,

46:09.880 --> 46:10.680
but he's here.

46:11.640 --> 46:12.120
Right.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.280
I'm literally just camping on top and kicking.

46:15.080 --> 46:17.240
The game hates Vespion.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.200
Oh, come on.

46:18.200 --> 46:19.320
I don't know the names.

46:19.320 --> 46:19.560
Right.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.840
Write the names of my team in Chaotic.

46:22.840 --> 46:23.480
I don't know.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.640
Charming is one.

46:25.640 --> 46:26.760
The game's slippery.

46:27.560 --> 46:28.920
Stoney, you can't hit them from there.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.520
Well, I need to be up at them.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.600
I'm just gonna farm my ultimate.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.440
You see that blue bar at the top, right?

46:38.120 --> 46:38.840
Whoa.

46:38.840 --> 46:39.800
Well, I did something.

46:40.440 --> 46:41.080
Okay, we got it.

46:41.640 --> 46:43.560
Charming could have saved themselves,

46:43.560 --> 46:45.160
but they should have stayed with friends.

46:45.160 --> 46:45.480
Oh.

46:46.360 --> 46:51.240
Okay, we've got two turtle doves and a partridge and a pear tree.

46:51.240 --> 46:51.720
And then what?

46:51.720 --> 46:53.480
I'll just go back down here again.

46:53.480 --> 46:54.520
Oh my god, camera angle.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.480
Please work with me.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.640
It really is...

46:57.640 --> 47:00.040
I don't know why it's not letting me manipulate the camera.

47:01.800 --> 47:02.680
I'll stick to it.

47:02.680 --> 47:03.480
We charming.

47:04.120 --> 47:05.160
Vespion.

47:05.720 --> 47:06.680
Vespion.

47:07.640 --> 47:08.920
Charming in the power guy.

47:09.000 --> 47:09.880
You know what?

47:09.880 --> 47:12.280
You've literally given me nothing to work with.

47:12.920 --> 47:18.120
And you will be punished for your sins against me.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.240
Oh, there's a railing.

47:23.320 --> 47:24.840
I'll collect coins.

47:26.120 --> 47:27.480
Do not read that.

47:27.480 --> 47:27.720
Yeah.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.440
What does that mean?

47:30.440 --> 47:31.000
I don't know.

47:33.240 --> 47:34.440
Okay, one, two.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.000
Oh, I lost all my level ups.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.040
Man.

47:39.880 --> 47:40.840
Charly...

47:40.840 --> 47:41.720
Oh, no.

47:41.720 --> 47:43.240
Vector the crocodile.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.840
Espio the chameleon.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.160
And a bumblebee.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.680
Charmybee the bumblebee.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.280
Sweet little bumblebee.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.160
I do like him.

47:57.480 --> 47:58.120
Wow.

48:00.120 --> 48:00.600
Right.

48:00.600 --> 48:05.480
We just need one more golden little turtle enemy.

48:05.880 --> 48:06.680
All right.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.600
I sense gold.

48:09.800 --> 48:10.280
Okay.

48:10.280 --> 48:11.400
And I sense nothing.

48:14.920 --> 48:15.640
Ah, sorry.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.400
I love this flower teleport mechanic.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.080
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

48:19.800 --> 48:20.520
I don't care.

48:20.520 --> 48:21.960
I'll take 12 more of them, please.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.040
Okay.

48:24.040 --> 48:25.000
You, Peri.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.120
If I slam down around them, do they become attack balls?

48:28.120 --> 48:29.080
I think they do.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.760
Because he's getting hurt, but I'm not actually doing anything to him.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.920
I can't see the enemy.

48:35.560 --> 48:36.120
Where is it?

48:36.120 --> 48:36.840
Oh, there is.

48:36.840 --> 48:39.960
I found the enemy right in front of my face.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.360
It was on the lower floor?

48:42.360 --> 48:43.640
Oh, don't see that.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.000
Have I just done a circle?

48:46.360 --> 48:47.480
Oh, no.

48:47.480 --> 48:49.240
Is this the start of the map?

48:50.360 --> 48:51.400
Fua!

48:51.400 --> 48:54.040
How was your first YouTube stream?

48:55.320 --> 48:56.840
Hi, Fua and Gain.

48:59.080 --> 49:00.680
Fua, if you didn't know,

49:01.560 --> 49:06.440
Fua, if you didn't know, had her first YouTube stream very recently.

49:07.400 --> 49:08.680
But hi, Raiders.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.880
Amstwarnica...

49:09.880 --> 49:10.200
I...

49:10.200 --> 49:11.800
You do not have a wrench and hammer.

49:11.800 --> 49:12.440
Hold on.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.320
Can I do it?

49:13.320 --> 49:13.720
Hold on.

49:13.720 --> 49:14.120
Hold on.

49:14.120 --> 49:15.240
I know the music just cut out.

49:15.240 --> 49:16.120
Wait, I need to give...

49:16.120 --> 49:17.080
Must give wrench and hammer.

49:17.080 --> 49:18.040
Must give wrench and hammer.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.000
Whoa, whoa, hello.

49:21.000 --> 49:21.400
Hi.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.360
Just for the Raiders, Amstwarnica,

49:25.560 --> 49:26.440
from Violaure.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.680
That's right, the porn company.

49:28.680 --> 49:29.000
Sorry.

49:29.160 --> 49:29.800
All right.

49:32.760 --> 49:35.160
And we're playing Sonic Heroes,

49:35.160 --> 49:36.040
a little childhood game,

49:36.040 --> 49:37.240
but yeah, if you didn't know,

49:37.240 --> 49:38.520
for the Reeflings, actually,

49:38.520 --> 49:40.520
Fua just had her first YouTube,

49:40.520 --> 49:41.640
a little stream,

49:41.640 --> 49:43.160
and she was really nervous for it.

49:43.160 --> 49:43.640
What's that?

49:43.640 --> 49:44.440
I watched it.

49:44.440 --> 49:45.240
Yes, I did.

49:45.240 --> 49:45.640
I know.

49:45.640 --> 49:46.520
I can't believe it.

49:46.520 --> 49:46.920
I haven't...

49:46.920 --> 49:47.640
I have many a time.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.320
Boom, like that.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.600
Just like that, you stand it.

49:52.120 --> 49:54.040
Get wrenched, get wrenched, get wrenched, honestly.

49:55.720 --> 49:56.680
Okay, how's that?

49:57.640 --> 49:58.360
That look good?

49:59.640 --> 50:01.160
I'm just making sure the stream

50:01.160 --> 50:02.440
isn't playing in the background,

50:02.440 --> 50:04.440
and then it doubles up on audio by accident.

50:04.440 --> 50:04.920
There we go.

50:05.480 --> 50:07.640
Okay, we sadly have missed the turtle.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.440
So I think we have to replay

50:10.440 --> 50:11.880
through this entire section again.

50:14.280 --> 50:15.240
Maybe, possibly.

50:16.280 --> 50:17.240
The audio's fine.

50:19.240 --> 50:22.680
I need one golden turtle.

50:22.680 --> 50:23.880
I can't find it.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.400
Okay, I do love the game for that.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.320
I hope your stream has been going well.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.680
It's been amazing, honestly.

50:30.680 --> 50:33.080
I've been spoiled by my reeflings.

50:35.400 --> 50:38.760
So I couldn't have asked for a better streaming time,

50:38.760 --> 50:39.080
honestly.

50:39.080 --> 50:40.520
It's only been a month, but well,

50:40.520 --> 50:41.800
actually, nope.

50:41.800 --> 50:43.160
We're getting close to two months.

50:44.680 --> 50:45.640
Can I do army?

50:45.640 --> 50:47.240
Oh, we're almost halfway through July.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.960
Yeah, almost one and a half months.

50:49.960 --> 50:50.680
Let's fucking go.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.040
Oh, I love streaming.

50:52.040 --> 50:52.920
Oh my god.

50:52.920 --> 50:53.720
I love my life.

50:57.720 --> 51:00.600
Oh god, I'm so out of it right now.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.160
There's one up ahead.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.440
Someone's waiting for me right now.

51:06.440 --> 51:06.920
Whoa!

51:08.040 --> 51:09.160
Not from Veiler.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.360
That was not supposed to happen.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.360
Hi, Broly Legend.

51:12.360 --> 51:13.400
Thank you for the tip.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.600
I said hi, Broly Legend.

51:15.560 --> 51:18.120
What do you use the not the Veiler for Peeler?

51:18.120 --> 51:18.680
Damn, already.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.280
It feels like a debut just happened.

51:20.280 --> 51:21.800
Time goes by so fast.

51:21.800 --> 51:23.800
It's not even possible to keep up.

51:25.560 --> 51:27.000
I hope there's a guy here.

51:27.880 --> 51:28.600
Is he here?

51:32.280 --> 51:33.960
Okay, maybe I'm starting to understand

51:33.960 --> 51:36.440
why this is like such a long game.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.200
I didn't think they were bad.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.440
Man, Fletcher and Gage are really good.

51:49.560 --> 51:50.840
Am I going in circles?

51:50.840 --> 51:51.640
Did I miss it?

51:54.280 --> 51:55.320
Oh, we found them.

51:55.320 --> 51:55.960
We found them.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.800
Literally, all we have to do is nuke them.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.360
Ah, we did it, we did it, we did it.

52:05.000 --> 52:05.560
Let's go.

52:05.560 --> 52:06.520
Next level.

52:06.520 --> 52:07.480
He was back there.

52:07.480 --> 52:08.680
Oh, well, I found another one.

52:08.680 --> 52:10.760
I guess they must put multiple on the maps

52:10.760 --> 52:12.360
in case like you get stuck

52:12.360 --> 52:13.560
because no one wants to be stuck.

52:17.320 --> 52:19.960
Slonic hero stages are notoriously big.

52:19.960 --> 52:22.520
That took me eight minutes to kill three things.

52:23.320 --> 52:24.360
That's how long that took.

52:24.360 --> 52:25.800
That's shocking behavior.

52:25.880 --> 52:26.360
Shawnton.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.720
Okay, stop fooling around.

52:31.720 --> 52:34.200
Okay, stop fooling around.

52:35.400 --> 52:38.920
Yeah, no, maybe I was the voice actor

52:38.920 --> 52:40.680
for Charming, maybe?

52:41.400 --> 52:42.600
A little Charming roleplay.

52:43.640 --> 52:46.920
Look at them pixelated yetis.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.760
I don't know how pixelated it comes across

52:48.760 --> 52:53.080
on your screen, but I can feel the pixels on my end.

52:53.080 --> 52:56.120
Who's this broad?

52:57.320 --> 52:59.160
You mean the bad guys?

52:59.160 --> 53:00.840
You mean the bad guys?

53:03.960 --> 53:06.680
Team Darkseid just taking like 16 minutes long.

53:06.680 --> 53:07.160
Oh, god.

53:09.160 --> 53:10.360
I don't know how to fight.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.200
What am I doing?

53:14.200 --> 53:14.840
Oh, my god, stop.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.800
Give me the freaking B level up.

53:17.800 --> 53:18.040
Go.

53:18.680 --> 53:20.040
I'm freaking scared.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.480
I'm scared.

53:23.480 --> 53:23.960
I'm scared.

53:23.960 --> 53:24.520
Give me the B.

53:24.520 --> 53:25.560
Okay, we've got the B level up.

53:25.560 --> 53:26.120
That's all we need.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.080
We're level two on the B.

53:27.800 --> 53:28.840
Get off the map.

53:28.840 --> 53:29.800
Get off the map.

53:29.800 --> 53:30.520
Off the map.

53:30.520 --> 53:31.240
Off it.

53:31.240 --> 53:31.960
Off it.

53:31.960 --> 53:32.360
Off it.

53:33.480 --> 53:34.760
No, they got me.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.240
Get off the map.

53:39.240 --> 53:39.960
Get off the map.

53:40.920 --> 53:42.920
Okay, we got rid of the bat apparently.

53:46.760 --> 53:47.560
I'm scared.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.760
Okay, they're just like a pair of stunlocks right now.

53:50.760 --> 53:51.320
I'll take it.

53:52.760 --> 53:53.720
Get off the map.

53:55.640 --> 53:56.360
Get off it.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.200
He's just got nuts down there.

53:58.200 --> 53:58.840
Where is he?

54:01.800 --> 54:02.600
Oh, there he was.

54:02.600 --> 54:03.000
He's there.

54:03.000 --> 54:03.400
He's there.

54:03.400 --> 54:03.880
I see him.

54:04.920 --> 54:05.800
Go away, Shadow.

54:06.360 --> 54:07.240
Get off the map.

54:08.760 --> 54:09.560
Oh, I'm freaking sick.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.120
I don't know how to do this, honestly.

54:14.040 --> 54:14.840
Okay, hold on.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.200
He's actually annihilating me.

54:16.200 --> 54:16.840
I'm using my ult.

54:16.840 --> 54:17.560
I'm using my ult.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.360
I don't know how to throw him off the map though.

54:23.480 --> 54:24.840
I'm just going to spam with...

54:24.840 --> 54:25.880
We charm in.

54:25.880 --> 54:26.600
Okay, there we go.

54:26.600 --> 54:27.400
Okay, we ulted.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.160
Giving them the silver treatment.

54:29.160 --> 54:31.480
Wait till Shadow uses his special technique.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.040
A gun.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.480
Okay, yeah, I did that.

54:35.480 --> 54:35.960
That's right.

54:35.960 --> 54:36.520
Give me an A.

54:38.840 --> 54:39.960
And why was that a C?

54:39.960 --> 54:41.800
I did it in under two minutes.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.280
A C?

54:42.280 --> 54:43.640
Shouldn't that not be a B then,

54:43.640 --> 54:45.160
if it's supposed to be under a minute?

54:46.760 --> 54:47.640
I want to play!

54:56.920 --> 54:58.280
Yeah, if anyone is like...

54:59.640 --> 55:02.280
Just spam tornadoes to speed character

55:02.280 --> 55:04.680
and you win in less than 10 seconds.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.440
They weren't walking in moe tornadoes.

55:08.360 --> 55:11.000
Thank you for the tip, tiny spiny.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.120
Quite literally with the game.

55:12.120 --> 55:13.320
Right, what was the objective?

55:13.320 --> 55:14.360
I wasn't paying attention.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.960
Oh, get coins.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.880
Look, top left, it says get coins.

55:27.080 --> 55:27.560
I don't know.

55:29.080 --> 55:29.400
Whoa.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.520
The triggers are reversed.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.040
They're on the wrong side.

55:34.040 --> 55:34.280
What?

55:35.160 --> 55:36.920
When I do left and right, it's wrong.

55:38.440 --> 55:39.000
Okay, hold on.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.440
I need swaps of one of the others

55:40.440 --> 55:41.240
because I'm getting nowhere.

55:42.920 --> 55:44.200
Okay, did that help?

55:44.200 --> 55:45.080
Is that where I want to go?

55:45.880 --> 55:47.400
Oh, that level up feels good for me.

55:49.480 --> 55:50.920
I need to get what?

55:52.280 --> 55:53.880
I'm trying to get up, I am.

55:53.880 --> 55:54.840
I'm trying to get up.

55:54.840 --> 55:55.880
Okay, we did it, we did it.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.400
200 rings.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.560
Okay, wait, this is like straight gamble.

56:09.000 --> 56:10.120
Well, if we just need coins,

56:10.680 --> 56:11.960
did I kill that guy back here?

56:11.960 --> 56:12.280
I did.

56:15.160 --> 56:16.280
Oh, no, I picked up the key.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.720
Oh, I really don't want to do any of those missions.

56:20.520 --> 56:22.120
I accidentally got the key.

56:22.120 --> 56:22.520
Oops.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.480
Oopsie, whoopsie.

56:34.200 --> 56:38.920
Yeah, for anyone that wondered why I base off the OSTs,

56:39.800 --> 56:43.080
just listen to the music and appreciate what it's like.

56:43.080 --> 56:45.720
It's just so beautifully crafted.

56:45.720 --> 56:46.600
Maybe not this part,

56:47.480 --> 56:49.880
but it's supposed to show falling into descent.

56:56.920 --> 56:58.760
Whoa, no, come on.

56:58.760 --> 56:59.560
I was doing it.

57:01.320 --> 57:06.360
I can't, it won't let me select the guy that's stuck in the machine.

57:06.360 --> 57:07.880
I could have gambled that, come on.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.240
Casino.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.280
I can't get inside.

57:18.040 --> 57:18.360
What?

57:21.160 --> 57:22.520
Okay, no, go in.

57:23.240 --> 57:23.480
What?

57:25.480 --> 57:27.480
He is bugging out on that thing.

57:27.480 --> 57:28.840
I can hear it from over here.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.280
I'm so sorry for that noise.

57:34.280 --> 57:36.120
The game, he's stuck in here.

57:37.240 --> 57:38.520
I can't even push him out.

57:39.320 --> 57:43.080
Oh, I pushed this out somehow.

57:43.080 --> 57:44.040
I don't know how I did that.

57:45.560 --> 57:47.640
$2, give me more coins.

57:50.440 --> 57:52.360
No, I'm trying to get out of this section.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.600
Yes, there we go.

57:54.600 --> 57:55.880
Okay, let's go in here.

57:55.880 --> 57:56.280
Jeez.

58:00.680 --> 58:01.880
Okay, we did it.

58:01.880 --> 58:03.640
I hate when I can't get inside too.

58:03.640 --> 58:05.720
I was freaking so stuck there.

58:06.840 --> 58:07.560
Try my best.

58:09.240 --> 58:12.040
Uh, we've apparently lost Speedy Gonzales.

58:18.120 --> 58:21.960
We've just straight up lost someone up for the speed character.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.800
Nope, how much do we need?

58:25.800 --> 58:27.160
We need 70 more coins.

58:29.880 --> 58:31.480
We've like straight up lost him.

58:31.480 --> 58:32.600
He's not even respawning.

58:33.960 --> 58:35.800
Now she'll lose the house to Gamba.

58:36.680 --> 58:37.720
Espo dead.

58:37.720 --> 58:39.080
He's literally popped his clogs.

58:39.080 --> 58:39.720
He's had enough.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.120
I mean, I hope we can progress.

58:47.400 --> 58:47.720
What?

58:48.920 --> 58:51.320
I really hope we're not going to get a section

58:51.320 --> 58:53.640
where we need him because hello.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.440
Oh, I did not mean to do that.

59:01.080 --> 59:07.960
I'm going to be the bumblebee in case we get put into a very unique situation in a minute

59:07.960 --> 59:12.360
because why is it not spawning him back in?

59:16.440 --> 59:19.160
With him gone, you will know smell the cold.

59:19.880 --> 59:21.240
He got lost in the Gamba.

59:21.240 --> 59:22.840
That's exactly why I didn't show up.

59:22.840 --> 59:23.400
See kids?

59:26.040 --> 59:26.280
No.

59:27.400 --> 59:27.640
Whoa.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.720
Okay, we did it.

59:31.720 --> 59:32.920
I don't know how, but we did it.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.480
Is this not a jump against the wall one?

59:39.560 --> 59:40.520
Okay, it's this one.

59:42.120 --> 59:42.920
What are we looking at?

59:42.920 --> 59:43.240
Come on.

59:43.240 --> 59:44.440
We must be close by now.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.520
I need to destroy these guys.

59:48.520 --> 59:49.160
Let's just do that.

59:50.200 --> 59:50.920
Espo back.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.680
He paid his Gamba debts back.

59:53.960 --> 59:56.840
Actually, I wanted to ask you about the...

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.240
What?

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.480
Why did we win?

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.320
Because we destroyed enemies?

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.840
I mean, I guess you get money.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.080
I had to wait to say five minutes.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.040
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.800
I apologize to any Fuwa.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.400
Enjoy.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.040
I'm so sorry.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.480
I'm probably butchering her name as well.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.600
My accent, Fuwa the Neko Vtuber.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.720
Thank you to anyone who's binchening.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.040
She had a fantastic first little YouTube stream.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.320
You got 218 rings from that fight.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.920
Okay, I'll remember that.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.480
If there's another money mission, I'll try and remember that.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.480
That Yakuza game.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.960
Is the Yakuza games good to play on stream?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.120
Like, am I going to be able to play them on stream?

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.880
Because I am interested in them.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.760
I'm not going to let...

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.240
No, I don't want to play the freaking...

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.760
I accidentally picked up the key.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.640
Forgive me.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.280
Oh, see, that's what I don't like.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.960
I randomly yank your momentum.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.120
Oh my god, but it's so Kawaii-ne though.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:58.760
Hold on a minute.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.960
The music cannot be jamming.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.120
Oh my god.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.000
Oh, it's so Kawaii-ne though.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.720
What am I supposed to do?

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.280
I don't know.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.320
Okay, okay.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:14.680
Okay.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.640
Don't hurt him now.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.440
Don't hurt him now.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.920
Oh, sugar rush.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:21.880
Wow.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.360
I assume...

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.800
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.160
Okay, yeah, I'm sorry.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.240
I couldn't do it.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:31.880
I suck.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:32.920
No!

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.240
Are we done?

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.040
Hydration check.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.640
I'm currently hogging the microphone

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.800
because I freaking picked up the thing wrong.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.440
Okay.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.000
Oh.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.640
Sorry if you get motion sick.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.400
This probably isn't the scene for you right now.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.680
Oh no, not the bombs.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.280
Oh wait, I'm running out of time at the bottom?

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.080
Oh my god, I have to get through this level.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:01.640
What the heck?

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.280
Oh, I'm out of speed boosts.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.320
I'm out of speed boosts.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.040
Oh, we made it.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:14.520
It's fine.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.160
Plenty of time.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.720
Jeez.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.040
Right.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.480
Do not let me pick up a key again.

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.840
I do not like that.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.200
I'm literally hogging the microphone.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:20.600
I am.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.480
I've got a big man.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.280
Not I'm something.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.000
Team Chaotix blasts give tons of rings.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.240
I wonder, I guess maybe because it's their thing.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.680
Oh, we got two lives out of that.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.240
I mean, sure.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.400
I'm probably going to throw myself off the map somehow.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.600
Bingo highly.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:37.960
Uh-huh.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:41.720
Uh-huh.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.040
This is the song that my theme song is based after.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.360
Notice how it goes ear to ear.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.400
My background music goes ear to ear.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.760
If you listen, nice thing.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.000
Oh, let's try it again.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.320
Hold on.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.960
I think I wasn't supposed to do it that way, but we did it.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.440
Strony's panic when she realizes Sonic games want her to go fast.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.120
Okay.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:19.800
Oh, dear.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:21.560
That's not the best outcome for that.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.280
Oh, I love this.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.280
A very important chip.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:41.320
Oh, I'm so sleep deprived, but this song is so good.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:45.560
No.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:50.200
Oh, I need to level everyone up.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:52.920
Okay.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.560
What does this do?

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.280
Well, hold on.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.200
I need to give you your motherfucking wrench.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:01.960
I show you, Ms.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.360
You're being punished by becoming a moderator.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.000
Yeah, you have been punished.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:09.800
Congrats.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.600
Do not resist.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.240
Well, it's running.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:21.400
How the last time we saw Mismar was, um, give me a wrench and I'll get right or

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.640
to work on open VTubers to work POV.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.320
Honestly, that's terrible, but it's kind of true.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.120
How are you doing?

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.160
Don't miss my last.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.320
I knew you were on Pokemans.

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.240
Whoa.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:41.480
What?

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.000
I can't.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.520
It won't let me swap to be.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:44.840
Okay.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.240
Now go.

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.200
Oh, there we go.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:48.840
Bingo highway.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.000
Not those kind of chips.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.400
Silly.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:56.760
Oh, okay.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.440
Oh, I guess I didn't want to get that.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.000
What?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.600
That like completely bugged out.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.480
Bingo.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.280
Oh, that wasn't paying attention.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:14.600
Hold on.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.480
I was supposed to.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:15.720
All right.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.200
There we go.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:16.520
Sorry.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:17.720
I'm supposed to hit.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.120
There's a bit of a strange delay going on.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.680
Is there a chip up here?

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:24.760
I mean, it must be down here.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.080
Hold on.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.320
Let me get my team back since they all despawned.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:34.520
Uh, I'll just use my own pure laziness.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.680
Now not only the other mods can ban me, but VTubers as well.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:39.480
Exactly.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.000
The DH Charmy.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.240
In the original game, he's married with kids.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.320
The little bumblebee.

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.400
Who's he pollinating?

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.160
Married with kids?

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.520
Well, I had a divorce in the retcon of the lore.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.320
Like, what?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.520
Oh, I see it.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.400
I want the chip, please.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.320
4 out of 10.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.680
What happens if I pollinate, huh?

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:11.640
What are you going to do?

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.280
Nothing's happening.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.480
I won't let me go in.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.200
Go in, please.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.160
Yay!

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.200
He was so very...

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.480
What's playing Pokemon got very sad

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.720
because there was one I really wanted to catch trying to cast.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.840
He stopped that.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.320
Oh, gosh.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.080
Oh, I was so lucky.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:27.480
Hold on.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.480
He's pollinating every queen out there.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.280
He's like that.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.960
Pollinating every sunflower, you can find.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.200
Conquer is bad for a day's style.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:37.400
Wow.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.560
You're okay.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.000
5 out of 10 for Chiep.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:43.560
I think.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.640
Ms. Margell has an ASMR stream coming up

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.920
if I'm not mistaken.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.800
If I've not been taking a cheeky peek at you,

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.440
I think you do.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:57.480
Enemy's up at home.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:58.680
Whoa.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.560
Can I get?

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.280
Yeah, I need him.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:01.720
Yeah, I need...

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.080
Are we out?

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.640
We did not just out of bounds.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:05.880
No!

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.280
Hold on.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:10.200
Okay.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:10.760
I think we...

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.960
Okay, we can get back in.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.360
I have never done that in my life before.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.120
Okay, let's go.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.280
I didn't...

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.160
I haven't...

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:19.880
Oh, whoa.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.520
Hold on.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.240
I think...

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.320
I think maybe...

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:26.040
Yeah.

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.720
Yeah, I was going to say that's a little bit too sad.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.320
Ultimate time.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.520
Yeah, fun fact about that, ASMR.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.200
When it happens,

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.360
I'm banning everyone on YouTube except you!

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:38.840
This is the way...

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.600
How dare you?

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.720
You wouldn't ban my reeflings, would you, though?

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.240
Come on, we're just here.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:45.880
Oh!

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:46.520
I missed!

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:47.240
I missed!

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.600
Oh, I didn't realize...

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.480
How is that supposed to know

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.640
I was going to be chilling there?

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.200
Seriously.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.920
Oh, my God, I'm going so fast.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.360
Please, I just want this.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:56.680
Okay.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.880
Okay, do not fall off the mat.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.080
Oh, no!

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.520
There was one back there!

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.080
How...

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:03.320
How...

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.040
How am I supposed to see him?

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.440
How many do I need?

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.320
I need two more.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.680
And I've passed two.

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:12.120
Oh, but one more!

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.000
One more, one more!

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.120
Okay, we've got a bingo though, poggers.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:18.920
There are more than 10 chips.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.200
Okay, thank goodness, because...

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.800
I can see the rest of the map there.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.280
I'm glad I will see good map design and stuff.

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.200
Like, if you're going to make me aim for like...

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.400
I can see a chip up there.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:31.880
Can I get it?

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.680
Oh, no.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.280
I cannot because I've fallen...

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:34.680
There, right.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.160
Oh!

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:35.960
Ta-da!

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.440
We did it!

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.960
I like how friendly they have been in this game.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.280
They could have made this so difficult if they wanted to.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.920
And yet, they've like put extra stuff then, so...

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.240
Thank you, development team, for many a year ago.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.520
You did fantastic.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.240
And I think you should give yourself a pat on the back

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.720
because you have made the game not frustrating

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.160
by doing these kinds of things.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:55.560
Thank you.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.480
We're just a couple of little guys.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.360
Stroney, you're such a good gamer that you're breaking the game, honestly.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.200
I'm a little bit...

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.960
No clip to game by accident.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.160
Awesome!

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.000
Totally awesome!

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:09.880
Awesome!

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.960
Totally awesome!

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.200
I fucking love charm...

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:14.680
Charm.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:24.840
A fight?

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.520
I can't remember how many levels there are

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.440
or if it's the same for everyone, but...

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.400
I think it's like Haunted Mansion.

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:37.160
And then...

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.240
An airship?

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.240
Wow!

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:46.920
Can I get...

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.840
Okay, we've got one level up on Espeon.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:53.720
Oh, there's...

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.200
Give me that!

01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.400
No, go to him.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:55.720
Yes.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.320
No, do not spawn in the enemies!

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.000
No, go for him!

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:01.720
Okay, there we go.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.760
He's leveled up to two, surely.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.280
Surely.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.280
Stop bouncing on that.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.280
Wait, I saw those air birds though.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:16.280
14 for Dark, which is the one with all levels.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:16.520
Okay.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.640
She's gonna become a bee.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.680
Bee, bee, bee.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.800
Charming bees.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.800
I just loved it.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.080
I just think he's cute.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.680
And neat, okay.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.360
Oh wow, wait, we don't have...

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:36.040
I guess we need level three in order to get these guys in one shot.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.680
I'm just sending them to go do it.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.000
Sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.280
It's the real cannon level, the forest level,

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.640
and then Haunted and then airship.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.840
And then we're done already!

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.400
We're out.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:53.640
We're out.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.280
No, bitch.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.160
Not, bitch.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.840
Stop bouncing on this freaking jump pad.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:03.800
I can hear it.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.840
You're getting distracted, teammates.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:08.680
I just...

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.040
No, go attack.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.680
Oh, there's one more.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.640
Okay, we got it, we got it.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.760
The silver ones are armored.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.240
Only power and falling does damage them.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.680
I do admit I love the safety of the flying.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.360
I'm sorry, cream carried last time and our tails did.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.760
Oh, that's an ultimate if I've ever seen one.

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.960
Oh, they do get tons of money.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.440
I like it, I'm here for it.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.720
I got more money for those kills?

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.600
Wait, we already have Team Blast again.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.520
Okay, let's just ultimate since there's a turtle, guys.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.000
Hold on.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.600
You need to replay the bridge mission on Microsoft to balance this game.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:21.560
So, my dad was, as I said yesterday,

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:23.000
but my dad was legit laughing at me.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.280
I'm like, bro, I'm beating him up.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.520
Okay, that's an ultimate again.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.320
We're on...

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.720
Wait, can we just keep repeating the alls if we get coins?

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.360
Hello?

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.520
Can we just keep going like this?

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.000
Those were easy ones.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:51.400
Okay, I'm learning the strats about Team Chaotic.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.280
I'm here for it.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.280
Money farming.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.440
You can chain them together as Chaotic if you defeat enough.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.360
Wow.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.560
Wow, there were a lot of them.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.240
I'm here.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.000
I'm getting it.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:09.720
Real Canyon!

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.680
Oh, it's our mission objective.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:22.840
Ooh.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.520
I like when you hold eggs, they all look backwards.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.400
It's so cute.

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.520
I wasn't paying attention to the mission,

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.560
so we're just going for it.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:35.960
Let's go.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.160
I assume need for speed.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.080
Get up to 200 miles per hour,

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:41.720
and then the game...

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.480
That's the mission done.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.120
Let's go.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.120
I'm not just...

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:56.120
Why am I going so slow?

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.240
Am I going crazy?

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.760
I feel like I'm going really slow.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.440
I even want to press X.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.120
Am I supposed to tap it rapidly?

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:05.880
I'm tapping.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:06.520
I'm tapping.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.880
I needed to be the bumblebee.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.880
Right, I'm being the bumblebee,

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.840
but I know what to do.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.080
If you turn into the lane that goes faster...

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:21.580
Ooh.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.840
Oh, I don't like that.

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:26.840
Oh, my God, that makes my...

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:34.840
I've not been funny, but that falling makes my clean shot,

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:38.840
because I literally can see the fall distance.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.840
I'm going, I'm going, and...

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.840
I am so slow.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.840
I don't think I'm supposed to be doing it this way,

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.840
but I'll just send it.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.840
I'm going, I'm going.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.840
Okay, we did it.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.840
Level up bumblebee.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.840
He certainly looks like it to me.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.840
I don't know about you, but...

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.840
Do not pick up that key.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840
Do I make myself clear?

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.840
Yes.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.840
Nope, not that. This one.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.840
Taking Strony on a roller coaster ride.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.840
I'm scared of roller coasters.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.840
I don't even know how you guys do it.

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.840
People are like, oh, I'm so glad I got to go on the upside down curvy.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:40.840
Why is the camera locking like this?

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:42.840
Fly, okay. That is why.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.840
The camera said I've had enough of your shenanigans.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.840
No, no, no.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.840
Camera, please work with me.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.840
I'm begging.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.840
Okay, there we go.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.840
We're doing it.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.840
And maybe a really awkward way to do it,

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.840
but we're very slowly doing it.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.840
Okay, look.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.840
The rabbit or the hare?

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:08.840
Wait, no, that's not it.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.840
The turtle or the rabbit?

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.840
Oh, this sounds so badly.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:14.840
So badly.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.840
They must.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.840
And this is why we're the fricking

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.840
Bumble Beach.

01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.840
Oh my gosh.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.840
I'm not well enough to be having heart attacks like this.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.840
Come on, let's send me, please.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.840
What's this?

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.840
Push me back. Don't do that.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.840
I guess we fly over.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:48.840
Wait, we can't fly over.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.840
No.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.840
Put me back.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.840
Why even?

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.840
Why? Why even?

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.840
Why even place such a thing there?

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.840
What even is that?

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.840
So only the middle one sends you back.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.840
And if you're dumb enough to pick the outer ones,

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.840
then that's on you.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.840
Please, camera angle.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.840
I am begging you.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:22.840
Sweet little bumblebee.

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:24.840
I mean, he did try and save us,

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840
but we didn't do it.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:28.840
Hard clench.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:30.840
Rail canyon is such a buggy level.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:32.840
The only time I die in this game

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.840
is legit due to,

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.840
like, the camera not being nice

01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.840
or

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.840
the mapping going funny.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.840
Like, it shouldn't do that.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.840
Again?

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.840
Okay. I'm not to be the bumblebee,

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.840
I don't think, when I'm on these,

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.840
but he's the safest.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.840
He's literally the safest thing in the game.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.840
Because you can pick yourself up

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.840
when you drop fall off.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.840
Right.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.840
And then the other rails.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.840
Right.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.840
Now destroy that.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:12.840
Right.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.840
Oh, there's something in here.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.840
Oh.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.840
Okay. I thought it was going to, like,

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.840
a switch or something.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.840
The rails are so scary.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.840
Okay.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.840
And now I'm too low level to do anything

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.840
from a distance again.

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.840
No. Bumblebee.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.840
Okay.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.840
And then press the button.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.840
And then I guess, jump aboard.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.840
Are you squid me right now?

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.840
Something I think we've learned

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.840
is that all we need to do is drive

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.840
strongly around at high enough speed

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.840
and that instantly makes her woozy enough

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.840
to be in subspace.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.840
I'm so confident on her bike,

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.840
but not in the car.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:00.840
Why would you want me to be a nosy

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.840
then? That's so mean.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.840
I was so ill because of that taxi.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.840
Thank you tiny spin.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.840
But I was so ill.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.840
Why would you want me to be a nosy?

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.840
I had to, it literally was so bad

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.840
it didn't go away after, like, a sleep.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.840
Oh, there was a bomb.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.840
I'm sorry. I see it now.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.840
I see my ignorant ways.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.840
I'm just going to play it safe.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Drive her around.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:28.840
Just pick her up and spin her.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Get the siph.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.840
Is it the siphon-trypical force?

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.840
Yes, this looks correct.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.840
Stay on one of the buttons.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:46.840
I'm being trolled.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:48.840
I'm actually refusing.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.840
Just carry her. 10 hour car, right?

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.840
I wouldn't even make an hour.

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.840
I am so terribly

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.840
bad.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.840
The siphon-trypical...

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.840
I can't even remember the fricking word.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.840
It's like siphon-trypical force.

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:06.840
Oh, and a level up.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.840
Oh, we can finally destroy.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:10.840
Please do not perish me and begging.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.840
Against my greater judgment

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.840
I will go

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.840
we espion-vespion

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.840
because

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.840
I think they've only made it

01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.840
with these height

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.840
hitboxes in mind and that's why

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.840
I keep getting perished.

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.840
I really don't want to lose.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.840
I run now.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.840
I'm moving, I'm moving.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.840
I promise.

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.840
I'm going, I'm going.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.840
The sound effects are actually

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.840
bugging out a little bit.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.840
Wee!

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.840
Any movie shows

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.840
watch along the streams

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.840
coming up

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:54.840
not until two weeks

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.840
away.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.840
When

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:00.840
Meeda goes home

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.840
I am going

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.840
to do a ton of back to back

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.840
to back to back streams, okay?

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:08.840
To make up for all the missed membership streams

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.840
like I'm talking like daily membership streams

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.840
I'm like public streaming

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:14.840
to make up

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.840
for all the streamies that I miss.

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.840
But for the next

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:22.840
two weeks, no, there's no ASMR

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.840
and there's no

01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:26.840
did I just miss?

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.840
Okay, I think I'm supposed

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.840
to go this way. Hold on.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.840
Okay, that looks right. Yeah, that looks right.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.840
Now that you mentioned

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.840
Siphonchic Focal Force, did you know

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.840
that you can use it to scramble eggs

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.840
without breaking the shell?

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:46.840
That's cool, I like that.

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.840
I like

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.840
there is, hold on, what's in here?

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.840
Money!

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.840
Well, I don't need it, but thank you.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.840
Someone else might need it. I'll take this one though

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.840
because it's okay, I won't take this one.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.840
Are you squiddling here or what?

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.840
Freakin' in a...

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.840
Having your head spin from car rides

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.840
gives a wonderful excuse to plan in X-Tress

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.840
stops on a road trip to make your head

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.840
spin in other ways.

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.840
Eh?

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.840
Tim Shull, what did you say?

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.840
Having your head spin from car rides

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.840
gives a wonderful excuse to

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.840
plan in X-Tress

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.840
stops on a road trip

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.840
to make your head spin in other ways.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.840
Is this

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.840
refling asking for head?

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.840
Yes or no?

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.840
Be honest, what did you just ask for?

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:36.840
I'm too, I am

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.840
so sorry, I'm so sleep deprived

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.840
right now. I am fighting

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.840
for my life trying to speak English to you.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.840
I

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.840
am fighting for my life.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.840
Okay, let's go

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:50.840
him again.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.840
I was supposed to go up?

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.840
Why

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.840
jump?

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.840
Don't make me jump.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.840
Wait, did I just do a circle?

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.840
I think I may have just done a

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.840
circle?

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.840
No.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.840
Oh, actually I've

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.840
miraculously appeared where I need to be

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.840
at the right moment.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.840
And now go for it!

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.840
Wait, there's something

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.840
in the middle there.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.840
Shawnee doesn't even speak English

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.840
honestly.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.840
Oh shit, hold on.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.840
Stop, camera please.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.840
Wait, that wasn't even a

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.840
This is just for monies?

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.840
Oh no, it's not.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.840
Wait, I've done it, no.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:44.840
Okay.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.840
Assume

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.840
this?

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.840
Okay, it worked.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.840
It worked.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.840
We're doing it, we're progressing.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840
Hi.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.840
Thanks for joining me.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.840
I don't know when I think Shibi is.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.840
What?

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.840
Was I supposed to do

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.840
something there?

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.840
Shibi and Azura are collabing here, it's

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.840
Audra.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.840
I don't think I'll be able to redirect, I don't

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.840
know. Maybe.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.840
What is happening?

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.840
This is making my head

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.840
stand.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.840
I'm trying, I promise, I'm trying my

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.840
best.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.840
Oh, we did it!

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.840
I didn't expect that.

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:46.840
Another endurance stream.

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.840
I don't even know if I'm going to last two

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.840
hours, I'm going to be honest.

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.840
I'm not kidding when I said I haven't

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.840
slept.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.840
So I did Isaac with you

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.840
and then

01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.840
I went out with my dad

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.840
and I did all this stuff and we

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.840
found my mom,

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.840
found my granddad.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.840
I got a two hour nap

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.840
after the cafe.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.840
I woke up

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.840
and I was like, I don't need to stay because I'm

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.840
full.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.840
And then I've been up freaking

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.840
working doing all this behind the scenes stuff

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.840
and I still didn't

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840
raise Shibi's script, which I need to write.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.840
It's just

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.840
a simple ear cleaning script

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.840
that I forgot.

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.840
I'm to

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.840
okay, I'm to destroy these

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.840
little egg capsule design

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.840
things.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.840
If you don't feel well, take a break. No, no, no,

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.840
I know, I know.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:46.840
I think maybe we could probably

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.840
do a Sonic Heroes marathon

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.840
though. I wouldn't mind trying

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.840
100% this game.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.840
In terms of doing all the

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.840
gang stuff.

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.840
I don't know about collecting all

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.840
the emeralds, that's something

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.840
even I'm not sure I've got

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.840
what does this do?

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.840
Nope, nope.

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.840
Have you considered

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:14.840
a sector or other sports stuff?

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840
It's just

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.840
I don't know

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.840
how I had the brain power to even do anything

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.840
about that.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.840
It's just things need to calm down.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.840
That's it, there's so much going on

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.840
but things aren't calming down just

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840
quite yet. That's what I'm waiting on.

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.840
But essentially

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.840
I'm about to have no

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.840
major

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:44.840
role

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.840
at all. I'll just be full

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.840
strummer.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.840
Please actually

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840
perish this so he doesn't get caught.

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.840
Okay, there we go.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.840
Oh gosh,

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:58.840
I don't know if I'm going to get all these.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.840
I hope to police tons around the map.

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.840
But yeah, sorry

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.840
I'm really not able to articulate

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.840
quite well at the moment.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.840
Do you apologise?

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.840
Turns out if you didn't get enough sleep

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.840
it affects your ability to communicate.

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:20.840
Weflin love, thank you.

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.840
I think

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:24.840
I might call it at the two of remark.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.840
I'm trying my hardest

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.840
to even speak. I is so

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.840
hard right now.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:32.840
But thank you for understanding. Thank you for the tip as well.

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.840
She

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.840
No, she

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.840
apparently doesn't know that

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.840
she's not supposed to stream every single day.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:42.840
No, I think I like

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.840
it. I like the consistency. I like

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.840
the idea of you being like

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.840
you know, like oh

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.840
you know

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.840
I fucking come on

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.840
a sentence

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.840
please. Oh the consistency is nice

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.840
because like oh

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:00.840
it's this time, Strong's was going to be on.

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.840
I like that. I like the familiarity

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.840
being like oh you know what

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:06.840
I'm bored or I want to listen to something

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.840
in the background while I work.

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:10.840
Strong's was online, right? I'll have a

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.840
we listen in type thing. I like that.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.840
There's like 6

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.840
or 80 on the map. Oh thank goodness.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.840
If there's that many on the map

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.840
I'm not stressed. Right. We'll level up.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.840
That's what I want to see.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.840
Sleep fun. No, no.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.840
Don't give me my money.

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.840
I'll go off it too. How about that?

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.840
Thank you Doomsday Dan

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.840
for the tip. I'll

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.840
go off it too. How about that?

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.840
2 hour mark. I feel like 2 hours is fair.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.840
And then

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.840
we'll do a Sonic Heroes

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.840
Marathon

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.840
and we'll finish it.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.840
Don't think I didn't spot this one.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.840
I might be delirious

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.840
but I spotted that a mile off.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:52.840
It's nice

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.840
being here with you every day. Well it's nice having

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.840
you every day. I'm very lucky

01:28:56.840 --> 01:28:58.840
that

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:00.840
you know even

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.840
you know even though I'm a bit

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.840
special I'm a bit different. You know what I'm saying?

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.840
Can I go in please?

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.840
Okay there we go.

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.840
Strong's standard time

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.840
honestly.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:14.840
That's nice.

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.840
I don't feel

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:18.840
pressure streaming.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.840
Oh I need to do this.

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.840
Oh I messed up.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.840
I don't know. It's just such

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.840
chill and pleasant

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.840
time.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.840
I do speak on it often but I don't

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.840
feel

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.840
streaming daily is taking too much

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.840
out of me. What it is

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.840
is that

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.840
things haven't calmed down

01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.840
because

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.840
a new thing pops up and I'm like

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.840
oh crap that's right.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.840
I

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.840
said it a wee bit but

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.840
the girls got a little

01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:54.840
sidetracked

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.840
and the audios weren't really recorded

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.840
in time for the editors to pick it up

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.840
so then I had to kind of pick up a bit of it.

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.840
Oh I see it.

01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:04.840
I see it.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:06.840
I was up editing

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:08.840
my stuff and I've got zero stuff to do

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:10.840
and

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.840
the girls have over Emi, Mersi, Shibi

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.840
and Asi should all have at least one audio

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.840
up for this month but it's kind of

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.840
those things where like I kind of really

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.840
planned for it. The girls were having fun.

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.840
Of course they got distracted. They're only human.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.840
I'm not going to be a weirdo and be mad at them

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:26.840
or whatever like the fuck.

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:28.840
Oh!

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.840
Can I destroy it?

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.840
No I can. Okay just be nice

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.840
and careful.

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.840
And then it's like yeah I had

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:40.840
this stream plan come on

01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:42.840
and why am I flying?

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.840
This is a fan!

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.840
Oh my god wait

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.840
the games

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:50.840
registering me is falling

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.840
no.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:56.840
Yeah this is the only place

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.840
where I see it. I was here for a month

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.840
I was actually here for a month.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.840
Feels good man. Sorry I just fell off the map there

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.840
and just about did it again.

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.840
Game?

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.840
Game doesn't like me.

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:12.840
I keep it.

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:14.840
I've never had so much issues playing Sonic Heroes

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.840
but Chaotic I think that's what

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:18.840
three instances now where it's been about

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.840
hmm.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.840
And destroy it. That's 18.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.840
And then we've got 19, 20

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:34.840
and 21 up ahead.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.840
Okay I was

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.840
worried I wasn't going to reach that but I did.

01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.840
21.

01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.840
Put charming thing thank you to the donation.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:50.840
Thank you.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.840
I'll just get myself.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.840
Oh what was the audio theme?

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.840
I might have been the writer for it.

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.840
I'm so sad when

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.840
August happens because

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.840
August means I didn't write

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:06.840
everything

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.840
so I can't get the credit for writing something good.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.840
It was the weird girl one.

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.840
There was two weird girl ones

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.840
that month for her.

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.840
But thank you for the five bully legends.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.840
Was it the one where the neighbour needs

01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.840
a liquid

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:28.840
or was it

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.840
Oh I wasn't paying attention. Jump.

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.840
I can't

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.840
sue.

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:38.840
Hold on I need to actually

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.840
use aimbot because I've only got two lives.

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.840
What the heck is that?

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:46.840
I'm holding.

01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.840
But yeah basically

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.840
once August starts

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.840
up like the August audio is coming out

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.840
I didn't

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.840
game.

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.840
Hey game you know how you were supposed to

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:02.840
propel me halfway across the map?

01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.840
Did you forget

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.840
that detail or

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.840
I

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.840
have never perished so much in Sonic Heroes

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.840
I'm all the way back here

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.840
on the games test

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.840
and me.

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.840
It's literally test and medicals

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.840
I'm all the way back here

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.840
Game is asleep

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:30.840
deprived of strong so I don't know

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.840
I can

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.840
skip these ones.

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.840
Oh I'm gonna say it.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:42.840
The game is not game in.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:44.840
Todd wouldn't say

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:46.840
it just worked.

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.840
We do a little teasing

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:50.840
we do.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.840
I still write all my

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.840
own stuff but that's because

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:02.840
I've lost them your honour.

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.840
I'm gonna stay on like this

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:06.840
I don't know why the beating would propel me forward.

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.840
This is freaking

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.840
adorable.

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840
Oh yeah for marriage you need to kiss me right now

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:20.840
Thank you boy

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:22.840
for the tip.

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:24.840
And Brian for announcing

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.840
I appreciate Brian in these parts.

01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:28.840
Maybe I can get the one that's up ahead

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.840
Whoa.

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:32.840
Yay!

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:34.840
Please do not throw me off the map this time

01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.840
I'm begging

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.840
Don't throw me off the map

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.840
Boom

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.840
What's going on?

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.840
Why are you putting me on him?

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.840
It keeps putting me on the B

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.840
I entered that

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.840
as the crocodile and it keeps

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.840
putting me on the B

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.840
I think because I keep losing

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.840
Speedy Gonzalez

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.840
Honestly the game could throw me on any other day

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.840
I'm like please not this day

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:10.840
I've had no sleep over I think it's

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:12.840
I don't know how long

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.840
It must be over 30 hours at this point

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.840
I've been awake

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:20.840
Because a two hour nap unfortunately

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.840
is not enough to replenish the

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.840
the old juices the old brain waves

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.840
It took me actually I edited

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.840
a bonus

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.840
like a subscriber special audio

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.840
but

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:36.840
again I don't know if I can upload it

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.840
to YouTube right away until the warnings

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:40.840
await purely because

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.840
purely because because because

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.840
because

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.840
the audio

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.840
is me sitting on the mic

01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.840
I'm like repeatedly sitting on the mic over and over

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.840
I cannot see

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:02.840
right okay this time he is fully

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.840
on me we have all

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.840
three of us together if this glitches out

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.840
one more time I'm gonna cry because it really

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.840
shouldn't

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.840
I'm not sure what to do

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.840
if it doesn't propel me forward I might

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.840
can't be a framerate issue

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.840
can he be

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.840
it's a speed thing as well

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.840
there there there oh we did it oh my god

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.840
right we don't even have to do that section

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.840
even

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:30.840
every time a glitch happens this one here is the

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:32.840
place of my head

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.840
keep going forward because that's what I did back

01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.840
when I went through this level

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:38.840
just don't breathe

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.840

I know what you want from me

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.840

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.840

I said I've just leaked

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.840
my alternative

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:53.840
outfit design it's actually a blackbird

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.840
SR 71 that I just said its name twice

01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.840
it's either an SR 71 or it's a blackbird

01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.840
your choice that was terrible

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.840
target destroyed

oh we got the jungle man

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:22.840
I would rage every day if you're an airplane

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.840
I had the same weird

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.840
Dr. Eggman

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:42.840
he wouldn't do something like that

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.840
right

01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.840
oh no the SR 71

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.840
how can you get any more powerful

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.840
well I honestly wouldn't mind entertaining

01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:57.840
an SR 71 gen girl

01:42:57.840 --> 01:42:59.840
I don't know maybe someone wants out of it

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.840
if no one wants the alternative outfit I'll take it

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:04.840

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.840

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.840
can't get it

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.840
I suck

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:48.840
I

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:50.840
can't even

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.840
I can hardly reach

01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:57.840
it's a stealth mission you can't be seen by the frog

01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:59.840
oh wait this entire thing's a stealth

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:03.840
I had no idea

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:05.840
that's actually such a cool concept

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.840
I didn't even know they did that

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.840
it says fly

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.840
it says fly ahead

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.840
I almost got baited

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:23.840
I almost got baited

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.840
I almost got baited so bad seeing that life up

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:34.840
that's so this is so interesting

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.840
oh hold on nope you can get me bitch

01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:43.840
look at that massive shuriken I can throw

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:49.840
wow this is cool

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:51.840
just don't get too close to the other frogs

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.840
or it's ogre

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:56.840
I like this

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:02.840
there's so much croaking

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:11.840
okay just throw me off the map it's fine I didn't want to play

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:13.840
smile

01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:17.840
I could fart on this game sometimes I'm gonna be honest

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.840
sometimes this game

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:23.840
I've definitely have to admit

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:26.840
I've never had more issues with like falling off the map

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.840
on any team than this one

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:32.840
and I've played like rows over and over and over and over again

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:35.840
but this is like rough

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.840
you have to fly over that one

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:42.840
fly over it

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:46.840
we going chaotic difficulty now

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.840
I'm flying I'm flying

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:02.840
are you joking

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.840
this game has some bangers

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:15.840
woohoo

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:20.840
that's what I get for having nothing but the audacity

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:23.840
to play this

01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:26.840
actually I really enjoy this game so it's not shit

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.840
okay let's go

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.840
let's do this one now

01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.840
because I've not done this one

01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:35.840
I've died so many times I couldn't have done all the path

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.840
she didn't

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.840
fly so good

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:43.840
that shouldn't be an SR71 after all

01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:46.840
okay

01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.840
let's jump over this frog

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.840
okay that was way better

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.840
way better

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.840
we have a poll in teleport

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:09.840
that's not poll in teleport

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:12.840
that's a poll in ledge

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.840
hey there's a frog over there

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.840
I love this game but the jank is so bad

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:23.840
oh

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:41.840
I remember you making me like SR71 and transforming me

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:44.840
we should watch the you guys are asking if I wanted to

01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:46.840
oh I missed

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:48.840
oh it's okay

01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:55.840
you would say that would be

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.840
you adorable little thing you

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.840
am I to fight

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:04.840
feels like I'm not to fight anything honestly I'm here for

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.840
I'm like we're a proper stealth

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.840
oh no

01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.840
I want to be invisible on the flower

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.840
woo

01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:17.840
how are you supposed to react to these bowls

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.840
you come at me so fast

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:28.840
don't murder char- wait you don't like char me

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:30.840
does no one like char me

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:32.840
I think he's

01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.840
so towards my goats of dwarves

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:41.840
what was that

01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:42.840
I'm on a hole

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.840
whoa

01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:46.840
oh

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:52.840
oh we did it

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:54.840
I didn't expect to do that

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:56.840
stealth mission complete

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.840
I've never played that one it was really interesting

01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:00.840
I didn't even notice that I like him

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:02.840
he's so annoying

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:04.840
even though hardcore sonic fans

01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:06.840
tend to find him annoying

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.840
I find him rather adorable

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.840
oh yeah

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:12.840
he's just a silly kid

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:14.840
I like his wee goggles and stuff

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.840
like cute as well

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.840
his wee avi or goggles

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.840
did you know in terms of

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:22.840
flight bumblebees shouldn't or something

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.840
I can't remember

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.840
maybe we could have done a little better

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.840
aw yeah

01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.840
I would punch him if I could

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:37.840
play some little freaking adorable thing

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.840
I don't know what I would say the worst

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.840
oh god no more missions

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.840
uh-huh

01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.840
10 chow

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.840
whoa

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:56.840
oh no

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.840
had to destroy these guys

01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:00.840
just go for it

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.840
drat

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.840
not good

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.840
can you stun him

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.840
yes thank you please stun him can you do anything

01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:08.840
what does

01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.840
I'm out of coins I think

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.840
oh that worked

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:16.840
I don't know how but it worked

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.840
lost the one up there clearly

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:28.840
one day I should remember what movie she wanted to watch

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:32.840
I'm so tempted to

01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.840
redirect into someone and go to bed

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:36.840
I'm so sorry

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:38.840
unless I love streaming I'm absolutely

01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:40.840
out of it right now like I can

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:44.840
do the Chacoa I've already got three

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.840
I knew it I knew it was going to be up there

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.840
I knew it the game was screaming

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:52.840
the server was up there

01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:54.840
right let's get the last one

01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:56.840
and we'll wrap up okay

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:58.840
whoa

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.840
I forgot his height is different

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:03.840
it's funny to see how

01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.840
team Sonic is normal and Shadow's hard

01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:07.840
but K.O.T. is just totally different

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.840
you don't have to read them just go to sleep

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.840
okay I finished this one

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.840
and then we take a break

01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.840
and we all get a good night's sleep

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:17.840
and I'm going to dream about

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:19.840
about you hugging me

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.840
and putting me to sleep because I'm fucking dying

01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.840
not to be dramatic or anything

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.840
but I'm hanging by a thread

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.840
smile

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.840
okay let's get our Chacoa

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:33.840
no no fall

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:35.840
okay

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.840
let's just

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:39.840
I'm going I'm going let me finish

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:43.840
really legend things

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.840
I'm going I will literally

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.840
go to bed after this one I'm not even

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.840
I will not fight and I promise you with how

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.840
I feel right now I am not fighting you

01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.840
is there something here

01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:55.840
wow

01:51:55.840 --> 01:51:57.840
okay we've got five

01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.840
and we've only just started this level

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:01.840
so we're doing fine

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.840
I've been

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.840
I missed it sorry

01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.840
sorry the flying

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.840
characters are actually just so op in this game

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.840
okay they're hiding them at the side of the screen

01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:21.840
so every time the camera

01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:23.840
is forced forward I will go to the

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.840
side of the screen because you're getting too obvious

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.840
right

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:29.840
rain rain rain I see the level

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:31.840
up on the right side look it's

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:33.840
Nisturshem

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:35.840
do you see the lily pad leaf and then the

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.840
flower these are modeled after Nisturshem

01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:39.840
Nisturshems are everywhere

01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:41.840
if you look for them they're an absolute beautiful

01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:43.840
flower

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:45.840
they are very

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:49.840
hardy plants and terms

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.840

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.840
you want to clap

01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.840
I can hardly get anything

01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:27.840
that took four minutes

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:29.840

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.840
cuddle puddle

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.840
I like the sound of that cuddle puddle

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.840

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.840

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.840
I'm not being dumb

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.840
have I never heard this before

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:43.840

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:11.840
I hope not copyright

01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.840
I can probably edit it out because the stream is

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.840
short enough

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:17.840
get off the map Amy

01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:19.840

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:23.840
fucking map

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.840
get off the

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:07.840
what was that I didn't know they could

01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.840
use their ultimates

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.840
that's so weird hearing singing

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:15.840
she sounds like a horse though

01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:25.840
I've never seen the speed character

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.840
stay on so long

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.840
get altered

01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.840
no no no do not lose flight

01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:35.840

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.840
cause it ain't me

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.840
off jeez la ways

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:49.840
that took forever

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:51.840
cream the horse

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:53.840
last time I fought him he just jumped off the ledge manually

01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:57.840
that was awful

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:01.840
what can that be all

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.840
I honestly can't even survive

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:09.840
oh we're in haunted mansion

01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.840
the jank has me dying

01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:13.840
I don't know how I could be so unlucky in one run

01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.840
I used up all my luck in Isaac

01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:17.840
obviously

01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:19.840
cause I've been flying off the map

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:21.840
willy nilly

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.840
oh I do love the music in this game

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.840
my eyes are glazing over right now

01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:33.840
I actually can't even focus just to see

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.840
right

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.840
I assume if I do quit it saves my last progress

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.840
fair trade honestly

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:45.840
oh wow we're 73% of the way there

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.840
did I just go

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.840
I don't think I can send it

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:53.840
I tell you what we'll do a marathon and we'll actually do 100% on everyone

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:55.840
deal

01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.840
deal we'll do 100% on everyone

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.840
okay

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:03.840
slumber time

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:05.840

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:07.840

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:13.840

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:21.840

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:23.840

01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.840
I actually can't redirect into anyone

01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.840
without

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:41.840
oopsies

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:43.840

01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:45.840
for a speech oh okay

01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.840

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:19.840
with it in the background I promise you you can

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.840
click off and you can look at something else

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:23.840
okay

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:25.840
but thank you so much for being so understanding

02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:27.840
about the situation

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:29.840
um yeah I don't think my dad

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.840
realised how much he's kind of pushed me

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:33.840
because obviously I stream

02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:35.840
and then I work but I am now

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.840
streaming working socialising

02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.840

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.840
talking to my family and all that and it gets

02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.840
quite a lot like it

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.840
definitely like increases

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:47.840
the stress

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.840
Emmys has an offline chat well I've shoved

refunds I'm so sorry that I

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.840
sounded so low energy it's because I was

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.840
I'm gonna be honest I'm shattered

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.840
I'm a puddle I'm a mess

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:07.840
I do have good news about

02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.840
pheromone maxing however

02:01:09.840 --> 02:01:11.840
the pheromones

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:13.840
have not been

02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.840
maxed at all I've been shivering every

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.840
day like an actual normal person it's terrible

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.840
absolute shocker behaviour

02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.840
cut back a little in the part you can make it up later

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:23.840

everything that has been

02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:29.840
missed out on endurance all that jazz I can go

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:31.840
straight back to it but

02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:33.840
it's very exhausting

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.840
socialising

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:37.840
I don't know I find it a lot easier to

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.840
not socialise smile

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:41.840
