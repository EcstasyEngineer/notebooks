no save data for something else i'm just me man i'm just i'm just binchening honestly paying fall guys with the splatoon ost is the best way to play it i have never played splatoon maybe i should i don't know if it's because it's an ink game oh i should have got a custom toggle the inks oh i just go like that and then the screen goes all black like in mario kart when the ink does this thing rub

first round knockout talking about that alternate outfit isn't fair lol i had to jump on this am i being pepega no i don't know how to do it anonymous thank you for the tip version i'm talking about the alternative outfit isn't fair why you don't like the idea of me sitting on you shocking i want to do i want to get a comic strip where i accidentally sit on you and i have no idea where you went and you're like obviously on my boat you can check what the key findings are how dare you suggest something so smart if you like games with ink i suggest you pay bendy and the ink machine is that a real game or did you just make that up that sounds like a made-up game oh you like ink that's right go play schwaubelmobel and the ink machine thank you veal or lover for the super chat oh it's a real game okay what kind of game it's a horror game oh no i mean i have a heart rate monitor and i have a uh shock collar on the way um i've i've asked if any of the girls want their uh if any of the girls want my shock collar um we have scrumptious night we have leo ink we have chair we have dust fantasy god king air solely oh no something like that doody uh sit and ink and that's how rooflings are i've missed one i think apparently um yes i have heart rate monitor now i also have a shock collar um i have a very interesting shock collar stream coming up um i'll be a slight blast to the past for a few years but um the punishment is if i lose i have to shock myself i had to get a freaking dog collar because obviously a dog collar isn't gonna fucking ask for your buddy ip address location name date of birth and all that whereas like this fucking chinese one did um so i've said to the girls i was like if anyone wants the shock collar for content i'll send it to you but just warning you that it takes your data and like the app takes your data as well and um yeah basically that's the trade off if you want a free collar you unfortunately have to give this app your thing but yeah i yeah the only thing i could get was a dog collar because it's not gonna ask for my freaking ip address um why does it take your data uh china is set up a bit differently like if you ever order anything from china you have whoa this song is so good sorry the whole thing just died off there we've got three leaflings left oh i'm sorry i've jinxed it oh okay well taken strong in front of all kids i feel like emi would love it emi's already got one shibi's already got one so i don't know if ac0 or mersey want to if they don't want it it's getting shoved in the bin but yeah china's goods are kind of set up slightly different from our usual wait you don't trust the chinese communist i'm like why the heck um why the heck that i have to give you a phone number to zap myself remotely and um i was like looking into the app and it scrubs all your personal data it like scrubs your phone contacts and stuff and i'm like no why would i need that to administer a little bit of shocky poos on myself no yeah literally thousand minus thousand social credit unironically though i can't imagine shibi shocking herself emis but not shibi i thought shibi already got one shibi already she bought the same one that i've got or i've got the same one that she got do you not want an extra 300 to your social credit score for boosting the economy we've already sold my private data it's already gone there's some guy called jimping that's terrible sorry that was a bad joke everything needs an app nowadays the data harvesting is real if it's free you're the product yeah i still had to pay for the software so wamp wamp or is it hardware sorry wamp wamp stroney do you want to hear a german doc oh dark joke steady on dem stay down stroney it's the feds we've determined from the way you've been using your shock collar that you may be involved in terrorist activity excuse me what did he say thank you dem stay down for the super chat that way i have to thank you for that uh how long you be streaming and i have

kids game this is actually good music i managed to dodge the monthly debuff by respecting into the woman glass later in the game oh what does that mean my respect in that's funny as fuck we will say it as many times as it uh-huh we want you to take care of your health more than we want membership streams you already quadruple the typical amount of streams members get i'm still blown away like people don't do that much change goods and services thank you miss morgan for the spec is actually such a good thing uh rilke kadmus thank you no thank you for understanding i don't want to be weird about it but i'm like rough i get really sick when i so obviously i've streamed from who goes about is like food not everyone mate you're done iron repert you're done thank you for the tip you're done no more you're done you're done because you're gonna start me on a tinfoil hat rant i was something with a sentence like that i'm gonna start me on a tinfoil hat rant what if i told you you know that's the whole point like you stream for one week 10 hours per day because you're crazy i don't know why you feel bad i guess it's just like because i know my dad's um getting here very soon like then it really will be like i can't i can't be like right let's play only two hours of baltrow wink wink and then end up with five hours like i know i can't do that when he gets here and it's going to be like that for a little while like oh my god is there someone called day worst player over there oh no notorious or your chithulu oh no you're literally called yourself day worst player all this is that we can finally catch up on the vod back logs oh honestly like last time it's really fucking actually sorry this is me just going on a rant about being a woman in general it's really annoying because one month ketchup season can not be that bad and then another like this month for example i'm like completely knocked on my ass like i feel so ill um like literally my wee heart can't it it doesn't feel good like i don't feel well i feel lightheaded i feel sick or that and then like the next thing i'll just be like no it's fine i was like oh okay then because like i literally obviously i streamed for the full month in june um so i streamed you know during that time and like i was absolutely fine and you wouldn't even be able to tell what stream i was on you know you know what i'm saying i've heard that can affect it too if you don't get enough iron yes i basically eat steak once a month to try and replenish my iron so i get to have steak so at least um my dad's gonna cook it for me i'm sorry but i like well done steaks i said what i said dinny give me a raw steak dinny give me a blue steak that hangs that hangs still breathing if you give me a blue steak that's disgusting that's disgusting okay we're here for well done steaks uh i am caveman eat meat okay caveman eat meat understand go medium that thing is raw but that that still has eggs from the worms inside it no well done eliminates any doubt of that sauce but um and it is i need to stay plump you know the booty cheeks have to be clapable at any moment moment for you when you when you clap into me i want you to be able to hear clap clap medium 140 kills the eggs yeah and you know what well done does absolutely just does that delicious this worms just give it texture do not take for the next 10 seconds do you understand me beefling for making me read that out loud strony you're the one that's done you're done no you're well done wait is this christmas map this is a christmas map overnight oh my god i can't wait to spend christmas with you it's gonna be so fun and everything well done makes it tough though i don't mind the chewing i think if you get a good steak it doesn't really chew like that oh the charcoal gives it texture charcoal like a grill cookie baking stream you want a bacon stream i can do a bacon stream i've got a really interest in handcam a some more street who won no way the two-time champion chair you did it twice congrats that was a full finish that was fantastic is the steak not grilled it's in a pan question mark a bacon oh you want me to just make bacon on the stream you don't want like i don't know cookies or something i'll just let you know that rare medium and all that crap was just an excuse for restaurants to turn out food faster cooking steak well done yet jussie is an art yeah literally gg of course you're saying gg won handcams are quite good yes i have a very interesting handcam asmr stream i'm very interested to see how it's received and i might do a membership asmr which is a bit more annoying i wouldn't mind cooking streams oh god keep strong oh let's go boil mash them stick them in a stew i can show you my washing board and my cutting board well i totally didn't buy a cutting board that literally says boil mash them stick them in a stew well i have a hobbit cut well lord of the ring cutting board again chopping board or cutting board and

thought we're doing teams we are uh is there like four like this i think i did it right in germany it's hard to find a good steakhouse that refling had the ground in the loading screen and it went splat on his squads it's four is it this is eight winner loses a four okay okay okay is there not one more refling uh one squad's gonna be three maybe it'll give me three because i'm the horse i don't want to cheat sit at all okay whoa you came in just in tech maybe you're a cute old fish you stop that you're gonna make me blush you're gonna make me ink being so nice like that tundra run complete levels to increase your crown rank huh who's my squad oh why are you wait why am i separated from my squad i'm separated from them okay okay wait hold on out sorry i've not played this one out excuse

flin maybe sticky pretty sure my squad just saved me you have like markers on your squad's head yeah oh no it's the reino game i'm gonna cause everyone to lose i'm sorry teammates carry me the best you can stomp and grind what a cute reino reino girl confirmed okay no more okay that thing freaking went for me stop wait i'm just standing here i'm actually just standing here so wait you want me to go on your back no no i know the other way around let me on your okay i'm safe my teammate is literally carrying me and we can do it we can do it but if we both get pushed off the map we're in so much trouble we are in so much trouble what about uh dempo's ice toy becomes material for gen 2 well i've got a fun stream coming off actually i'm gonna draw your gen 2 suggestions um it's not next week but the week after i'm gonna draw gen 2 suggestions um so you guys are allowed to suggest what you want yes if you suggest slime i'll actually draw it um but it's how i would want them to look again it's oh no it's pain no literally oh no oh dear we didn't make it but that's okay that was fun playing as a team because i didn't have to do anything i didn't have to do anything but yes you're allowed to suggest what you want me to draw is ms pain before anyone's like oh my god mlg i'm gonna see if marcie's willing to give me the bases she made for the alternative designs that she drew of us so you guys can be like i won a lollipop slime and then i'll just copy and paste the body and then i'll like draw my little bit on top i'm sorry i made us lose no it was fun i want to do more squads i'm here for the squadron oh what team have we got now we have five teams all based on marcie's body no no no no um marcie has bases from when she drew all if you didn't see the stream marcie actually drew all designs of us which was really fun um and uh i was just gonna ask her like oh can i pinch them for my we stream idea because i don't actually draw i shocker i don't actually draw um and holy crap you guys were like sliding and going for it it's over i failed you know we're gonna play again don't be silly the design she made for you was so cute the rifling slippers oh my gosh i so badly want them to be a thing because they're just absolutely lovely she spectated me oh yeah those bases were just marcie's base except for a zero was it no our team went first turn rhino to last on that one also the zeros design yeah do you like this straight up milk kind of sweater look to a zero i'm inclined to agree i like the um chanel look that marcie drove uh chibi as well stroney is what i am always watching you first match sorry rifling buddies it's okay you can do it you're allowed to you don't have to be mlg pro all the time don't don't be a silly sausage and put that kind of thing on you oh wait you've got assassins creative i see you where are you where are you i saw it's you i swear i saw it's you am i going crazy i knew i saw it's zero zero proof we can't be playing that hat was fabulous you can step on us this slippers thank you for doing the story first time playing this game but you're enjoying it i'm glad it's just like a silly game it's got such upbeat music as well like it's so fun and goofy and and it's like even if you get knocked off you're not like mad at yourself you're just like ah you know oh good everything is guaranteed to win there will be four winners this round oh dear there's one team that hasn't scored anything yet oh dear it's not looking good my it's not looking good i wish it gave assigned like team names so i could be like oh this team whoever's in this team oh we're humping each other oh no do worse players behind are you the only one on the map no you're not zero oh okay there we go i'm sorry team no no no no it's not like that it's goofy game three squads qualified oh wait there's an odd number of you never mind we won at the end will you take in consideration the scottish is more you mean make more scottish is more i can do that i don't think there are many games that make me sweat more than this one i felt that oh i almost choked there don't worry i did the choking around these parts yeah team names and team member names would be nice yeah even so i can just be like oh the avocado team or something as simple as that uh what what are you guys getting points oh i would not have gotten that i'm not even kidding oh my brain does not work like that there's no way i would have gotten anywhere near points in this i mean you could browse those spectators and name them yourself i don't know who's the part of whose team though which is why it'd be impossible to give you his name gotta remember which tells of the fruit you should play mario car it's a 12 game uh i suck at mario car um the new versions of mario car i can't play but if you want to roll me in the game absolutely i'm more than happy to play mario car but there's no way in heck i'm winning i don't know how it works i was cheating last time and i was oh i was getting used to hold back um um just so i can win oh there you go two squads we're in the last squadron what's it gonna be hexagon i've not got a switch we still qualify let's go oh what refling team will be stan left standing is the question and none other than the most recognizable game hexagon oh it's funny how they don't face you to each other now we do have to work as a team without sabotage on the board too much because you have friends so you can't just be going all willy nilly or else you're gonna perish day worst player might be in for a good player reward i don't know what i was trying to say there let's try so you might be thinking squady is taking a very interesting tactic and destroying a layer that the others have yet to reach hmm seems like we're quite populated up here there's a lot of reeflings on the yellow we're starting to fall down though you'll never guess what the hexagons are almost gone oh okay okay okay look i'm not a commentator i'm just doing my thing so they're killing each other friends this weakness leaving the body what are you are you perishing your teammates you're not supposed to hurt your teammates friends what friends just a miserable little pile of secrets those wengas oh i don't know that reference now there are three reeflings who are already on the lowest layer hmm hmm lay wink is trying to take out tiny spiny me so i don't think they're actually wait did they just take themselves out i think they just took themselves out solid blake is the only survivor of his team cookie fumbler and tiny spiny might actually take themselves out they are a part of the same take same team as nonism sorry i get so intense um cookie fumbler is just absolutely going through the hexagons not really maximizing his time with them the winners are the worst player solid blake parallaxian and lewain congrats on the winners i failed wow the lobby code six delta vector five bravo master chief the go clearly someone's got some errors in this game and it's none of us it's one of you but it's none of us okay solid clutch if you want a streamable cart game you may look at disney's speed storm i haven't played it since the beta but it was actually pretty fun gg i lost in the first round but that was fun award yeah well you can go again big fans race to the finish line oh yeah yeah okay squad height who's our squad who's my squad i see why am i so far away from my own squad i was dinky okay i need to focus i need to do good for my squad mates i can't let them down it's i'm literally on it as i'm saying i must focus i can't let my two mates down i'm on my anime arc where they're like super intense for like no reason and they're like oh i must do this i must do this this isn't about me this is about my my team mates oh i'm

you put your uh is what you put your clothes on to dry outside and it spins in a circle with the wind the game cheated and knocked me off map okay it keeps putting me in the same team danny i'll restart the lobby because it's putting me in the same team and i want a chance for like everyone to try and have a chance to be in the same team i was not paying attention for that to happen oh my god i think i'm about to throw up oh no it was a burp it was a burp it's fine out out stop it out stop it right let's recalibrate okay wow we made it there is a teammate that's ahead thank goodness because i am i am not doing so good oh surely i can make it okay okay we made it we've got a checkpoint okay look okay okay okay oh okay i'll take it i'll take it no it was a speed boost it was a positive okay it's a positive okay let's okay it's fine i did oh i don't want to win any i don't want to be first place you know i have to give the other reeflings a chance you know like i just i gotta give the reeflings a chance sorry my controller about to suck and get open in the settings menu don't worry throwing up on stream would definitely be a first hey mommy got warmed i got walloped honestly wow did we make it oh no we didn't make it but that's okay right i'll reset the next lobby because i don't think it's swapping the teams unless it is swapping the teams and i'm just getting really weird luck is it swapping the teams for you guys yes or no yes or no no it's not swapping it's not swapping okay okay i reset the lobby after this one and we'll get a new lobby code it isn't i'm in the same team as last okay okay i am learning doordish avoid the fake doors can the reeflings avoid the fake doors is the question will we spectate it's you oh okay we've got some leader reeflings all the way at the front somehow you're ahead of everyone oh well i jinxed it i'm sorry i jinxed it i'm so sorry hey we got it we got it oh it's a one in five four in five three in five does it just get less and less this one's so good for you to watch everyone just head button doors okay i like this one oh let's see what teams get there oh level over these perv reeflings in slow motion didn't make it have some studying to do for a test good luck on your test gambati do your best and something something if you chew gum whilst you study and then chew gum during the test your brain will connect the two doors i don't know if that's true or not but yeah that one is the ultimate rng but yeah like i like when it's up to chance and not skill my squad is on it let's go this one is it is avoid the thick doors can't avoid mommy's thick doors i don't think i've ever had my butt cheeks described as a thick door before oh yeah you want to open this door open them oh it's the fruit one careful okay you're gonna make oh god this one kind of makes me a bit motion sick you're simply gambling addictive look all i'm gonna say is that belcher was really fun but if you get sucky runs it sucks the soul out of you but as soon as you get a good run you get all the endorphins i don't think i can spectate i'm not being funny that's like legit giving me illness i'm like focusing on chatting said i threw so hard oh don't worry it's just funny games thank you for playing we're gonna reset the lobby so we get different teams maybe not a door but like a giant gate castle castle gale shawnee got them elden ring doors she's stop i know exactly what animation you're referring to when you open up like a door to something mommy i am seeing starfish is are you getting motion sick too man i wasn't paying attention i got eliminated oh sorry don't worry we still have time for more more more i'm actually really enjoying the squads i'm sorry i'm a sick for it i like being like oh i've got my wee team and i don't have to rely on myself fully when you get sucky runs it sucks so hard but when you win it's all then okay so gambler right okay yeah gambler do any of the teams sentence ought to be balanced no we're gonna have to reset the lobby because it's not like shawkin is about i've been able to get passed around since we did teams i suck oh you're too sweet strutting what do you mean we're just playing video or am i being dumb i like squads because i like the feeling of carrying yeah that's why i like being carried that's why i like squads oh my god we're a match made in heaven rieflin mommy you made like the first descent as a game wow i've never heard of it okay now i can actually watch the gameplay because i was gonna be violently ill oh it's rainos again stomping grand need to be passed around we stand as soon as i get eliminated chair is still in the run uh we're still got there's still three teams left oh my god how do we not spectate recon reform we don't spectate you much do we no pressure the whole the stream's watching you recon reefling no pressure at all smile oh first descent is a free third person futuristic sure you want me to want to show are you gonna see my aimball sure just being very supportive even when you're eliminated it's so sweet i just i just think it's fun getting to play with all the reeflings i i like stream sniping i don't have any problem with that i think it's fun like um i wanted to play apex but apparently people hate apex and i'm like oh it's a shame because like i get to talk to you in voice chat but i don't know if that puts people off so i just play safe i hope i hope you play ultra kill i'm pretty sure um azura is playing ultra kill at the moment i have no idea what the game is about oh two squads left and one that only has three members my squad through i'd watch apex couldn't pay me to play it not even if i was on your team we can go into salt lake city servers because no one plays on that and then it's just us everybody's watching did a scarier i got knocked out a few rounds ago time for me to choke look why why did it why does it all grip you in a team and like put you together are you squidding me right now um anon strongy is legit slim thick a small figure with sexy hips and cheeks to clap thank you kindly anon don't mind if i do get my ego stroked what's going on here stroking my ego while you stroke here so i'm on to you anon thank you you have 70 days on apex uh carry me question mark i was gonna do drunk apex but i'm not allowed to go offline until we win and you guys would have to carry me to win that's the only problem uh but then i was like oh people don't like apex i don't know if people are gonna be weird about it but like a valorant has teams of five so i could have four reflands with me overwatch two has four reflands with me apex i can only have two reflands with me wait when you're gonna play cod with the girls yay yeah when the uh i don't know what cod it was i think cod is a black up six is coming out or something i was gonna play it with the girl the gorals so just the never ending stream um destiny two rates sadly i've never played destiny i don't know what it's about i'm not very good uh but you'd have a full lobby of reflings and apex yes it would be a private lobby on apex and you would all join the code and then god this game is not getting easier i talk about a skirt in the rim holy crap wow oh this is they need a zoom out option held out verse two has a friend system that works well from playing with refunds unless it breaks i'd give hell divers to a shot apparently it's player base is dead though after the sony shenanigans congrats ruin desolation zero fu and sassafras congrats you did it you did it i didn't even know black out four or five worth near did i all right okay i'm gonna end the lobby because we're gonna start a new one i've forgotten how to start a new one host a lobby please yes and then show the new

everyone i believe in did you try the new elton ring dlc i did but we're gonna have to visit it once my dad goes away again and because i have like insane back-to-back endurance streams planned basically i think like eight hour back-to-back to back some 12 hours of i'm feeling cheeky she lasted 30 second seconds she has that hair trick mommy so attached was that she prefers to see the gameplay with us instead of playing oh no reeflings we never made it oh no oops oops we tried congrats to the reeflings i made it though congrats oopsies oopsie whoopsies i didn't mean to perish gg lol i know gg she believed in the only reeflings and didn't make it no no not like that oh i've not played this one frantic factory beans love to dress up unlock items and express yourself press the lift buttons to score points i don't know what that means but i will watch you guys with great intent being eliminated in the first two rounds since went in the first squad game rip okay what i don't understand what on earth is going on to be honest so those are oh oh once the light goes on you only get a point if you stop down on the light that's on okay okay okay okay once the light is lit up then you jump on it by the pope when do you plan on using the shock collar also i'd like to make a bet that you start whimpering in a cute way when you feel the shock we might help you discover a new fetish hang on steady on and the shock collar is planned two weeks the actual shock collar stream i'm to use on and and if it goes well i mean i can use it in general like see we play elton ring and then like we die when we go against a boss i can shock myself like that now i'm thinking of this damn whoever said that thank you anon for the tip um i would say it's probably two weeks away i just ordered it um it's coming from america y'all hello america um so i think it'll take a few days to get here in roughly two weeks and me you just press buttons yeah when the buttons lit up though it was me who said that you're welcome terrible terrible influence on one another wow we can't get away from stomping ground i'm ready to delete it and put it in the bin rhinos rhinos rhino skirt literally we can't get away from these rhinos is it that common of a map or are we just getting unlucky okay how many teams it looks like four teams yeah four teams left get luck replaying have a go each other oh one's already off the map sorry a little reflinger who we don't speak to you we're not speaking to you no pressure chad no pressure everyone's watching you are you a moan can you a moan in this game oh my god your t-pose and you can't a moan in this game what how do you do halloween pc um no idea i got disconnected don't y'all i don't know if oh everyone's spamming hello now what's going on here the rhinos were constantly invoking you strony have you completed elton ring the base game i have once before with the help of many but i did do it that's the main thing i did do it even though i had help i did do it so i have played the game i haven't finished the dlc though um i don't even know how little or far we're into the dlc uh last thing i remember was we found this flower place and there was a guy on a horse and we beat him up and then there's another guy on the horse and beat him up as well but we had to whack him a few times oh you're playing volleyball oh where's the ball oh come on replays you can do it there is one point scored already uh if i recall you're about halfway yeah we defeated the lion horse man in flower place is optional um we did try and get the guy that turns into a snake but he got the best of us so um i think we're just kind of exploring i don't know if we'll go back to base game or not i'm unsure but someone gave me a special crossbow that goes uh so i'm helping to get the the enemy a little bit in Elden Ring i'm going oh that volleyball does not want to go down wow i remember only you laughing so much while some reefling was trying to kill it did with the big sword but this should be like every moment of the stream so it's just so sorry i was laughing at a reefling wait this snake guy picking up a reefling was i laughing and nervousness because he was getting rolled to complete weapon upgrades the base game would be helpful yeah i think i need to do that problem oh no you did everything right i think you did everything right anyway mommy getting the enemy to bleed with the full auto crossbow what a fumble honestly the game's so like it's even how have you brought him how did you bring that back oh congrats to the winners h uh jk heather sasa france blank ellies and social Blake Blake Blake let's go that was a good comeback i thought you if that was ogre holy clutch literally right i think we need to reset the lobby every time

food either takimasu have fun we will have fun thank you for your kind words why not rotate between squads and something else what but if i do anything else i'm not in your squad i can do jewels if you want it to be if you want it to be really intimate reeflings i can do jewels is that what you want the chance to be with just mommy and your team me just me and you you have to carry oh maybe we should do that if we do jewels everyone has to jump on their jewels back and then we go wait this is the first one um am i gonna win i think i'm gonna be eliminated again i'm so sorry to the reeflings of my team being intimate one lucky reefling good luck okay okay let's let's do it let's qualify to score points where the heck am i going uh what oh i'm getting a bit confused with the science to this someone needs to clip you saying give me your butterfly no that makes no sense of context but i literally clean it i get a wings gate whoa whoa i don't have that kind of reaction time oh i did this time but what no reeflings no don't hit no reeflings don't hit the button no reeflings stop reeflings you're trolling me okay let me make it oh did i just kill that reefling oh wait is this the way are we to go down oh my god we're to go down in the middle go down in the middle reeflings don't get caught up don't get caught up don't get caught up i can do it i can do it i can do it it's right there i can do it jump i can do it okay i did it now what what is this oh my god i can do it i can do it for my team this is for you team oh i did it oh my god what is this map it's nightmare it is if you don't know where you're going it's so confusing it's over for me yeah you want the chance of jewels okay how about we do jewels next and then but we're not allowed to go we have to jump on our jewels back like all of us i was behind you the whole time yeah did we win no oh no reeflings we're so unlucky oh and that just that show of the upside down reefling falling off the map oh we're so unlucky we're trying our best though mm finally made it through the first round damn after land thank you for the tip anonymous someone needs to clip you saying give me your blue give it when training right now starts right now i have a collection of six i have plenty to go around although i might be adding to the collection soon i saw i saw a very unique animation and now i want something whoa wait why are you standing in the corner what is this what do you do is your goal to finish the keypad together oh wow no way you guys are smart enough to do that how do you know no way that's so smart sorry that's actually so smart oh we're making a few mistakes so we're getting there whoa oh my god i love this i want to play this one i'm going to ask the question every reefling wants to know but is too afraid to ask does strongly like a reeflings ink salty or sweet i like it anyway it comes thank you i don't for the tip if it comes from a reefling i'll take it doesn't matter the quality the condition if it's reefling ink i want it do you understand i want it why are you doing it reeflings look at the monitor to know what you need to make it's so funny to see the lag because like one reefling would be like i'm helping and then it's like destroying it mommy has an ink tax oh the only kind of tax i'll accept this is strong and you've got to be saying stuff like that when i'm helping my team oh maybe i should do that next time so we can win my teammates are not allowed to leave the mute stream for two minutes and then i just say the most absolute veil things i want to do to you oh reefling are you still sleeping oh you just stay asleep mommy just needs to help herself okay oh it's the christmas map that's so evil but effective well i mean my team isn't up anymore so oh we got a little love heart hello hello let's do it let's do it let's do it man this is unfair i like it did the room just get 10 degrees warmer go reeflings go go reeflings go go reeflings go you can do it okay maybe don't do that that was dangerous you do you're doing again you're doing again that's so dangerous little reefling oh god a tent got made you're welcome oh wait i don't know i don't know if french means cringe or not but to say you're welcome in french you say yapat qua stronti's secret cheat me locating the blood of the reeflings to the lore huh i'm wondering should i just do that mommy will there be a drinking game with us yes i've not decided what the drinking game will be yeah next week we're doing puzzles because it's nice and calm and quiet but i get to hate the image and then you guys get to come into the puzzle and then we do the puzzle together inking cube the blood knows where it just needs to go man let me just play drunk souls drink whenever you die to a boss i mean if you want drunk elden ring sure i don't mind whatever game you want to play is buckshot roulette a puzzle that would be a fun buckshot roulette is going multiplayer so we could maybe do stream sniping and that if i pray i'm like 100 sure the creator of buckshot roulette said that there was going to be like public access lobbies for streamers um which would be insane trying to like figure out what's going on all of us point and be like no you should uh yourself no you should uh yourself stronti no you'll perish did you just fart am i going crazy did i just hear a fart in game did i make that up i'm going schizophrenic yeah who do we know okay noob lord we don't normally spectate you a little egg plant speaking of farting that's not far that's a loaf of bread hold on a minute there'll be no fart in here it's latex creaking it's not a two oh okay i didn't know i was could have sworn i was like why did they randomly put fart dot mp3 in the middle of this oh no wait are you doing fine okay it's just your connection sorry i can't look too long on this map for some reason it goes from a motion signal i only get motion sickness in a car though i'm not in a freaking video game like i've never normally experienced it in a video game but i think because the camera keeps spinning in a circle we're baking a loaf out here aren't you guys always baking a loaf i thought guys like pooped multiple times a day aren't you all making loaves right now you have a morning loaf of bread then you have a night loaf of bread damn i got triple grabbed man reeflings are feeling a bit randy today clearly if we're all grabbing rubbing instead not really no i think guys apparently poop multiple times a day that was a real gropey we are not careful he's usually one loaf of bread a day i made it so far and all the time how long will today's stream be um i was technically supposed to be wrapped up by now i'll give a few more rounds okay and then i'll um i'm gonna go get a bath just to try and feel a bit better i whatever you do reeflings don't be a girl that's all i'm gonna that's all i'm gonna say okay depends on how much celery we end up having a few more rounds hey yo wait i just got the joke a few oh you want a few more rounds it depends how much celery you have for me oh come on it makes sense celery it makes it whiter or something i don't know it makes the load bigger you're welcome have you ever tried one of those warm bags for the ketchup season i use the hot water bottle and it takes away the pain but i take painkillers and all of that like i'm i'm not with no

too hard to carry straw day honestly though okay you don't have to do the piggyback thing you can just go for it now you can just run go reflings go check this out okay what we're checking you out what refling was that was it you that said check this out i think oh right well we checked out for a little bit i thought the piggybacking thing was fun yeah if i'm in the round i'll force you to piggyback but if i'm not in the round then you don't have to do it either i got sabotaged i don't know how to make someone else figure i don't know it seems really i like press up on the d pad and i think the other person has to press up but we can cancel each other out by accident okay carrying strawnee with those on your back must be both distraction and motivating honestly i wish the jelly beans could have a little bbl i'd buy that cosmetic i don't care sure i'd buy the the afo that cosmetic oh there's only a few eliminations that that was like what six wow person who pressed it forces the one who gets carried okay we're learning we're learning if we piggyback you you can whisper in our ears it's okay refling keep going you're doing so good keep it up faster faster you're almost there keep going and just something bbl oh that was the question i reflin asked on um on marshmallow they were like you always say your butt is bigger you got a bbl is it natural i'm like yeah it's natural it's complete luck because i'm small in height the the fat has to go somewhere and it picked my thighs and butt but i think because i ride a bike as well it kind of shaped my like where my fat distribution goes and it resulted in like a good like uh butt hip ratio type thing are you sweating reflin your breathing is pretty hard right now short stacked goblin core cuttlefish honestly i'm not being those allegations i'm tiny um i thought i was normal size to be honest like height wise but apparently not apparently i'm a teeny weeny are you trying to keep us distracted because you've achieved it haha some people are born lucky oh i'm not literally it's complete luck like uh it's not like i'm trying to like build my body to look a certain way or anything like that like no i sit on my arse all day long i do walks and i ride a bike that's about it strontius carry size okay i'll take that that's a compliment burning the thigh fat with the leg workout so but power remained if
