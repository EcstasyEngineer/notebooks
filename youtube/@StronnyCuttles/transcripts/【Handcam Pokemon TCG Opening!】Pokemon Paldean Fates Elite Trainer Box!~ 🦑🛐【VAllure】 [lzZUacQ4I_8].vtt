WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm not prepared for this thing.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm slinging gmods with a girl.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
I'm trying to keep a good body in me.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Like we did in each one.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
My face in the screen?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Yeah, it looks like the surfaces.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
There we have it.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
There we have it.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
And this is also my cat.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
The cat that we're using.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
And this one is my dog.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
My cat.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
It's looking good.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
It's looking good.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
It is looking good.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
It is looking good.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
You didn't work in?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
This is what you think, Borschti.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm just kidding.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Why am I a bruh?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
It's an only bot lane, you know.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Hi!

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Do you want to see where I still owns my fucking

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
unnamed seat collection?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Ray here!

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
I get to ruin all those samples that I took, so yeah, I spelt them all with my opnion samples, and I spelt them, so...

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
No, as a rule of thumb, the likelihood of me showing my face in the screen is very fucking high.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Am I gonna apologize? No.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
I didn't really get much time to say oh, it's a clean Gmod with the girls.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
So, we have this.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Hi mom, I can't get more than I'm good.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Your immersion is getting ruined, unfortunately.

01:46.000 --> 01:57.000
As I said, the likelihood of a reflective surface showing my bald GI balls is pretty high, so if you don't want to acknowledge that I am a woman, then you are more than welcome to check out our screen.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
This is not the screen for you.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
We are opening.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Paladin's face in my barber.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Can you hear me?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Hoodie up.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, you wanna put Hoodie up?

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It's actually really smart.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hold on a minute.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Women on the screen?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Green blanket.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
What does that mean?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
If I can even get into the spot.

02:21.000 --> 02:34.000
So, I have this as well, which we're gonna put away the ones we get in the correct order.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Have a face mask.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I don't have one.

02:39.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm having a show so the microphone picks me up because the microphone is now right here.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I just thought we'd do some gambler.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Go gambling.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Aw, dang it.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
The real gambler was trying to open the box to see if he knew.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Do you think?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
This is so reflective of that's the way to happen.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I mean, to be honest.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
To be honest, I just look like a depressed fucking, you know, golf ad, really.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Not that I am depressed.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
It's just I'm depressed.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
No, I'm not depressed.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
No, that's what I'm trying to say.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm not depressed.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Just, I look depressed on first.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Oh, shame you.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, what's going on?

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Now hold on a minute.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
The leg.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, pulling.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Maybe the real gambler was the one you were looking for.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
I am just in this to relive what I want in my childhood.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
I cannot miss the shame of things.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I'm actually in my time.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
What is this?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
This thing?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
Oh, let's see then.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And this is the coin flip.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
This one is the coin flip.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
There's the two.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Where's the refling card?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I will get it though.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh, this is like something I can make.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Oh, it's like I thought it was metal.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Classbook.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
TCG car truck simulators came out by the way.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Hold on.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Let me recalibrate.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I'm going to do it.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
So, do you know how to do it?

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
You step on it.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
I may as well go some higher.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yes, unfortunately.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Well, not unfortunately.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I was playing Gmod.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Where's the girl?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
So, I didn't have much time to set this up.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
So, I'm a bit...

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
Can you tell I've never opened a Pokemon box before?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
What am I trying to achieve?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Okay, we have...

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Holy shitele.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
We have basic decks.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I assume this is not the gambler.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Oh my god, shame you.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
So, this isn't the gambler.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
I assume these big pre-made stacks are decks, not gambler.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
And then it comes with its own pocket.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
So, if we get a really good card,

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
it comes with its own pocket of notes.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
And then...

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
So, if we get good cards, we'll put them in there.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
And then we've got...

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
What is that? Open five?

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Any Pokemon enthusiasts know what this is called?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
The big stack is all energy cards?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Are you serious?

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Why would they give you that?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't know why.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
It's a deck to Vador.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
No.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Look at you, you little nerd.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
Answered all our questions.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
Okay, I assume the gambler is these.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
This is what the gambler is.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
Oh, sorry. Let me spread it for you.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
All name gambler.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
This is why we're here.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
This is the money shop, people.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
The money shop.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
The gambler.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Right, what one do you want first?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Let's spread it.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Excuse my seat collection.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
What have we got?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
God, I don't even recognise half of these Pokemon.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Oh, God, I should have picked an old school pack.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
There's Pikachu.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
There's a pink thing.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
There's a blue thing.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
There's a whale.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
What one do you want?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Show me the card.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Why are they so big?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Why are they so big in your hands?

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
That's a booster pack in your hand.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
You want the pink one?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You want the pink one?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I'll give you the pink one.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I think there might be a code inside.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
So if you play the online game, sure.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
You can grab the code.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
There's only the difference to me.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Tinkerton.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Tinkerton.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Put your phone.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
It's just tiny hands.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Thank you for this set.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Dainan.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
M&S.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Oh, God.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Hold on.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Did we think about the real challenge about this stream?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Opening the pack?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Or literally opening them?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I can't do that.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Am I going to need scissors?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
What the hell?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Are these factories?

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Is this not for children?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Um...

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I just...

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Bruh, hold on.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
I'm getting confused.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm talking to the show now.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I'm not...

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
You were playing with me saying that.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So I'm going to get you ready to take over the stream.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Okay, first quiz.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Obtain...

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
the card opener.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Look, you remember when I said the nail glue one

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
and I needed scissors?

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
The nail glue got stuck to the scissors.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Ladrian.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Thank you for the extended membership two months.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Our having small hands is great.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Make other things bigger.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Right, we're going to make sure

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
we're not actually only cutting the top of the card.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
So as you can see, I'm using my finger as a gaze.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
Is that the result we wanted?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Seeing those Pokemon packs

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
and knowing the size of them,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
you really have tiny, adorable hands.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
They look massive in your hands.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
More than you know.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Whatever Brian is saying, I do not endorse.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Right, first gamble.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Okay, this is the code.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
If you're a gamer online,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
note yourself out.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
If you want to focus,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
so the QR codes are rich and durable.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
There you go.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
There you go again.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Right, I didn't even go.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Seeing those Pokemon packs

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
and knowing the size of them,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
you really have tiny, adorable hands.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
They look massive.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm actually just so big.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Is this the one where it's like

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
put two from the back to the front

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
and then, I don't know,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
open the pack,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
fill the code in one card to the front.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
This one to the front.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Okay.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Are you ready?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Oh yeah, I got an energy.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I'm so excited.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
You got elephants.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
No, you need to focus webcam.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Please.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
We're gambling.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
We're gambling.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Thank you.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
What the fuck is that?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
That's not technical.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Alright, I should have went old school with this.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I should have went old school.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Leechonk.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Leechonk, onk, onk, onk.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Okay.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Ooh, I like ganga.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
I like you.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I like that pun.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
You got technic on the tree.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Crisis punch.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It's emotional speed.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
You got...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
What does that do?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Dash bun?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Dash bun?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Wait, is this the part?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Hold on.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Wait, can I do this thing?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Can I do this thing that all the streamers do

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
when they get something like a really good pool?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Is it a good pool?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Oh my god.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
There's one good card in this pack.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Oh!

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
What does that mean?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Oh, oh, oh.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Right.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
He's shining, so we're going to...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
We are going to night him

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
with one of these,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
of the Static Force on his leg.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
We're going to have to put him in here.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
You go.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
What is you?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I told the crew.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So it's a tentacle, but not a tentacle.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Don't be distracted.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
It's not a tentacle, but not a tentacle.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Why should I throw it into the camera?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Because I don't know if it's a tentacle.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
We just slayed it in,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
and then we can get a perfect breed

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
when we sell this.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Oh yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
We just slayed it in.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
You know you guys still have another couple of irons

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
to do when you're still on 2D?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I don't know.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
It's such a good one.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It's just a little tentacle.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
You can...

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You can freak it out if you get a special artwork card.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I'm going to put him

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
to the side again.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And we got Haunter!

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Ah!

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
We got Holo!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Ah!

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Look at that.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Mmm.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Mmm.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Let's go down blue.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Do I put a Holo

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
in the shiny pocket as well?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Or is this a reverse?

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
Haunter and Gengar in sameSceneHackDane.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
How appropriate that first two could be.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
For the tentacles.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Is this pre-recorded?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Exactly.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
That put in a wee aslonee punch.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
I bet it's Husky and Snacky.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
You're winning?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Okay, good.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I'm going to put all my wee shins

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
in these specials.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
There's like tons of these anyway.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I don't know.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.400
So I'll put our pools so far that are good here and then the regular one, we're going

13:11.400 --> 13:17.920
to numeric the deck and then we're going to put it away in the binder the correct way.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.920
Okay pick a card, any card, any pack of yours.

13:21.920 --> 13:26.880
We did just do a tincture tin pack, so maybe we'll do Pikachu?

13:26.880 --> 13:37.280
Pikachu has three, wait there's so many left, yeah this is, that was the first pack that

13:37.280 --> 13:47.240
we opened, we've only opened one pack so far, right, right open, open, right as I said the

13:47.240 --> 13:52.600
cards are at the bottom, my finger is a guide to where the cards start, so I literally can't

13:52.600 --> 13:58.920
put into them, it's not possible, I've seen a few handcams like put into the pack and I'm

13:58.920 --> 14:06.720
like why are you putting into it so willy nilly, believe, believe, open cumin, we don't say

14:06.720 --> 14:14.480
open sesame around these parts, oh no, oh no, two cards stayed in, I don't know what the

14:14.480 --> 14:22.440
order is, order, okay you ready for your card if you play the online game, oh yeah,

14:22.440 --> 14:31.320
look at that, get that code in, get that holographic in the game, mmm yeah, that's great, you deserve

14:31.320 --> 14:38.440
it, right, unfortunately I messed up the opening so I don't know if this truly is where it belongs,

14:38.440 --> 14:44.520
so I'm going to put two in front, are you ready, boom, oh, well that worked out rather well,

14:44.600 --> 14:50.520
that doesn't seem to me, it's the start of the day, I don't know, how was I doing that, like this, yeah

14:52.120 --> 14:57.000
I saw something shady, I don't know what it is, but I see it, close, close,

15:01.080 --> 15:07.480
this is probably the hardest move, shuffle them for a surprise, I opened them wrong, can you

15:07.480 --> 15:18.280
please focus, oh I was going to get a model based after her, she has a lot of good

15:19.720 --> 15:28.520
art or software, hello what so, oh I like that, is that a indie electric flying,

15:28.840 --> 15:37.080
it's truly good, Ion is an annoying card, oh God guard of hours, pre-evolution,

15:39.240 --> 15:50.440
when you've got the fairing whip, I spent 40 instead of, Varun, Varun, and then, and then I'm trembling,

15:51.160 --> 15:59.320
oh, oh my God actually, I'm happy about that card, oh my God, I'm like so happy, it's guard of hour,

16:01.160 --> 16:08.280
oh I'm actually happy about that, I'm not even kidding, I'm actually happy, look, oh she's pushing

16:09.880 --> 16:13.080
and yes guard of hours is she, no I will not be taking any comments,

16:13.880 --> 16:22.120
right, guard of hour getting here, Scottish guard of hour cosplay wins right now,

16:27.880 --> 16:35.560
oh my gosh, so so far we have guard of hour, little kinds of in the booger, oh you can't really see

16:35.560 --> 16:41.560
the shine on them in these, but they are shining from us, very slowly, so that's our hall so far,

16:43.800 --> 16:50.520
there's an even more beautiful version of guard of hour in this pack, are these pre-selected cards,

16:50.520 --> 16:54.840
am I celebrating over nothing, are these not Rambo, are these not Gambo,

16:56.040 --> 17:00.200
and the four of them celebrating three, we've not done the wheel yet, or the purple one,

17:01.240 --> 17:06.440
well I do eat, well chi chi a Scottish thing, right, this is a Scottish thing, don't judge me,

17:07.400 --> 17:14.280
it bit dog shit, here if I need to see two, that's it, and then you pick this one,

17:17.000 --> 17:24.920
that's when you do it, and the they are Gambo kids, okay, as you are my witness, the cards are

17:24.920 --> 17:31.960
done there, she said dog shit, haven't heard that, takes a drag from a cigarette, haven't heard that

17:32.760 --> 17:38.760
yet, normally eating any of them anymore, but we were a bit different around these cards,

17:38.760 --> 17:50.440
right, let me grab all of the cards correctly this time, guard of hour, are you ready to study,

17:51.080 --> 17:56.920
oh up there then, no please focus, you're working focus right away,

17:59.960 --> 18:06.520
and then pick one from the back and put it to the front, and then watch,

18:07.880 --> 18:14.440
why don't you put the energy on the back, that sniff is so low, because you have flashback,

18:15.320 --> 18:18.120
yeah, we already got you,

18:24.680 --> 18:29.720
oh I've missed that one, mass chip, is it a Matthew, is it a Mickey,

18:31.880 --> 18:38.600
oh we got baby rolls, we have the rolls generation, oh man, hey I on Gary here, we already got you,

18:38.600 --> 18:43.720

18:43.720 --> 18:49.720
and we're getting duplicates, come on, whatever you ate, nasty, right, I like nasty,

18:55.480 --> 19:03.640
I mean you're different, I love it, what's his name, what's trio, are you squidding me right now,

19:04.120 --> 19:05.640
I don't know, I'm pretty sure it's them,

19:13.720 --> 19:17.800
let me put them away, gently put them in the pocket, and then I'll see what Brian's saying to me,

19:17.800 --> 19:20.360
are you squidding me right now, are you squidding me right now, a little bit more every day,

19:20.360 --> 19:24.360
thank you for his phrases, thank you, I love Scotland a little bit more every day,

19:24.360 --> 19:31.640
thankful for its phrases and you, oh wait what, oh my god I'm going crazy, oh well that's what we

19:31.640 --> 19:40.760
wanted anyway, and then we got this guy, eggs with people, and he's a huge basic, is it, how

19:40.760 --> 19:47.240
is the ranking, it's like shiny reverse hollow, what's the ranking, you're gonna have to tell me,

19:49.240 --> 19:56.200
again I'm sorry but I'm doing this for male attention, I'm getting no, I'm getting no enjoyment,

19:56.200 --> 20:02.840
no valence, no nothing sir, I've got two shiny hollows right, hold on let me check,

20:04.360 --> 20:11.720
because I can't hear and I've got my headset on, thank you lord of scorns for the tip and thank you,

20:11.720 --> 20:19.800
order Ling Mummy, why did, why did you order this ordered box, I would like to order them,

20:19.800 --> 20:26.040
yeah, yeah, wrap it up, wrap it up, you're getting spanky, these are our whole,

20:30.680 --> 20:32.200
we've got decent ones so far,

20:35.640 --> 20:38.760
it's okay mummy, we'll give you all the attention, oh my god attention,

20:40.120 --> 20:43.880
okay we've not opened up a wheel, so we'll do any mini mini mini more, catch the title,

20:44.440 --> 20:49.720
if this wheel lets it go, mini mini mini more, wheel pain, wheel pain,

20:52.280 --> 20:57.960
and then, well again fingers the gaze, so no cards are gonna get cut, no cards were cut,

20:57.960 --> 21:01.640

21:02.200 --> 21:13.080
see, not many awards, almost, almost, let's go wheeling, oh dang it, oh dang,

21:17.800 --> 21:20.600
I'm a wheel of the beach variety, oh hell yeah,

21:21.560 --> 21:24.520
that's also going on before we open the cards again,

21:28.360 --> 21:36.760
okay, ready, steady, go,

21:37.160 --> 21:48.520
one card to the front,

21:50.840 --> 21:54.520
do you think you'll play the online game, I might give it a shot, I don't see why not,

21:54.600 --> 22:00.280

22:03.960 --> 22:11.160

oh no you didn't see that, who's fucking doing that, terrible,

22:23.480 --> 22:26.040
terrible, I don't know who the streamer thinks they are,

22:28.680 --> 22:32.440
oh you're in my game too, you're in pokemon ruby, so I know you,

22:34.600 --> 22:39.240

22:40.840 --> 22:46.440
a nest ball, well that's a good sign, oh hold on,

22:47.240 --> 22:50.440
I thought that was something under the nest ball,

22:50.440 --> 22:54.360
uh swuba, I've played this den as well, I think that's pokemon black,

23:03.320 --> 23:06.840
okay I'm happy with a little bit of gold, I'm gonna put you to the safe

23:08.280 --> 23:13.800
and then we've got rate, Iona, how about you, Iona up to and give it a break, stop

23:13.800 --> 23:18.600
showing up, that's the third pack now, and then a researcher,

23:28.440 --> 23:35.000
not fast, not fast, not fast, but we'll still put them away in packets,

23:35.240 --> 23:46.520
really special packets, is it a shiny, I mean is it called a reversal thing because it's a

23:56.520 --> 24:00.200
mummy, wait, hold on I'm not actually seeing this again,

24:05.160 --> 24:10.280
oh wow, that's actually quite a unique one if your death is completely terrible,

24:11.720 --> 24:15.800
uh so when are we doing streams tonight pokemon, um right now I think,

24:16.760 --> 24:19.880
okay only five more gambas to go, what would you like,

24:22.360 --> 24:25.720
the streamers may be questioning if I'm sober or not, what does that mean,

24:26.680 --> 24:30.280
which gen is she from, I think seven maybe,

24:41.800 --> 24:49.000
your wish, my command, what's up big abby, I'm ash from pallet town

24:49.960 --> 24:54.760
and you're gonna be my new buddy, we're gonna be together forever,

24:55.960 --> 25:03.400
what, no, Pikachu, I'm not ditching you for guard of hour, I just need some personal time,

25:04.040 --> 25:11.800
you know, to train her of course, we're in gen nine, relax, relax, we need to rough up,

25:12.440 --> 25:26.120
that's the code, what is, holy shit that's ash's voice, no, wait yes actually I'm the real ash

25:26.120 --> 25:36.680
from ash pallet town, the hit video game series pallet town, energy, see I'm never unhappy seeing

25:36.680 --> 25:45.800
muster boys, I love muster boys, oh mr moe, nice to meet you, mom what are you doing with mr moe,

25:46.520 --> 25:53.560
you're making some weird noises last night, noobat is so cute and then his evolution it turns ugly,

25:54.360 --> 26:07.480
he's wrappedy, he's in put one black, he's found in the desert with one black,

26:07.480 --> 26:15.400
a electrical generator, what was mr. mom doing, I don't know, threw back the tea,

26:15.400 --> 26:31.400
Then we have a backpack. Oh my gosh, I'm so excited for the backpack. Get- get those legs out of here. You belong in the war. I don't care what they've done to your evolution line, get back in the war.

26:31.400 --> 26:37.400
I didn't know Mr. Mime could wrestle with your mom. That's so cool.

26:38.400 --> 26:47.400
Oh my god. Right, I take it back. Neubat's evolution is kind of fucking cool. Hold on a minute. Is that- is that Shani? Is that Shani Hollow?

26:47.400 --> 26:56.400
Is that Neubat? That's not Neubat's original look. See, Neubat's purple. Oh my gosh.

26:57.400 --> 27:03.400
Oh, is that normal? Is it not called Neubat?

27:03.400 --> 27:08.400
It's called Neubat. Yeah, first one's called Neubat. Yeah, I'll show you Neubat.

27:08.400 --> 27:20.400
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it. I pulled the fucking Shani. What? You mean there's a higher chance rate that every packet has something Shani in it?

27:20.400 --> 27:30.400
No, don't tell me such things. I want to see Neubat turn it- it involves into Neubat.

27:30.400 --> 27:37.400
What is the po-ka-dex of toy school and the- and the thingy? Hearing Ash cursing is so funny.

27:37.400 --> 27:46.400
What the fuck are you talking about? What are you doing? Pikachu, for fuck's sake. Just kill the leader.

27:46.400 --> 27:58.400
Why are you using Quick Attack? That's a normal type move. It's a fucking ghost type you're against. What are you playing at?

27:58.400 --> 28:07.400
Basically, have I imagined how Ash would be? Si, I wish women were real. Takes a drag from a cigarette. I wish women were real.

28:08.400 --> 28:21.400
I'm fake. I'm- remember, I'm doing this for Neal, okay? Ask her if I just snipped a card. I'm gonna cry. Did I? Did I just do that?

28:21.400 --> 28:27.400
Hold on a minute, Ash. You're on the back burner, son. I'm raging. Did I just snipped a card?

28:27.400 --> 28:33.400
Better not have. No, I've no- it's fine. I've no-

28:33.400 --> 28:42.400
Ash, are you ready? Online players. There's that code and QR thing that you can do now. Yeah, you like that.

28:42.400 --> 28:53.400
Did you go to pokemon.com slash bdm? Then you're not a real gamer. I like how the official lore is now. I've just done it now. There's no going back.

28:54.400 --> 29:04.400
She is doing this because she got paid by the casino. I'm actually addicted to gambling. It's a real problem, but I hide it behind this board.

29:07.400 --> 29:13.400
Oh, the results again. Magmar, playing the board. It's nice to have you.

29:13.400 --> 29:25.400
Oh, are you the pre-evolution to that pastry looking dust? I can't- I know there's a generation that is in France. Is this French?

29:25.400 --> 29:33.400
Is that French? Oh, not French. Are you French? Don't quit before you hit that jackpot. You already know it, baby.

29:33.400 --> 29:40.400
Lantern. He's an evolution of the night. Clive. Congrats if your name's Clive.

29:41.400 --> 29:45.400
Women's got- I'm reading this upside down, by the way. No, Jen's like this.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.400
Where has it been?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.400
What is it called?

29:51.400 --> 29:54.400
Oh, maybe it's what it's called.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.400
Cereluity.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.400
I don't know what you are. You're a poison type?

30:07.400 --> 30:13.400
The webcam ain't very good. You want it? Did we say it's good? Is it 16?

30:13.400 --> 30:19.400
I didn't see that. I promise I didn't see that. Life's sucker. Oh, wow. It's like a fighting type.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.400
I'm going to send the package.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.400
Cereluity.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.400
And then-

30:32.400 --> 30:34.400
Are we happy?

30:35.400 --> 30:38.400
I don't know. Are we happy?

30:38.400 --> 30:42.400
I'll wait for your reaction. Special art? Good?

30:42.400 --> 30:47.400
Good? Oh, hey! Hey! Must be streamer luck.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.400
Streamer luck, streamer luck.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.400
Streamer luck, streamer luck.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.400
Oh, no! I made a cup of tea!

30:59.400 --> 31:01.400
No!

31:01.400 --> 31:06.400
No! It's fucking cold!

31:06.400 --> 31:12.400
Whatcha say? I have no more milk, so I can't make another one.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.400
Whatcha say?

31:15.400 --> 31:17.400
No!

31:17.400 --> 31:20.400
I'm going to try it.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.400
No! Up for gore.

31:26.400 --> 31:31.400
Okay, we're going to very gently put her away. So she's the Ash, 2.0.

31:31.400 --> 31:35.400
So she just got a lighter voice than Ash. So if Ash is down here-

31:35.400 --> 31:40.400
I need to try and raise it up here. Is this how she sounds?

31:40.400 --> 31:46.400
I don't know. I haven't seen that anime, but you said she's kind of like a tomboy.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.400
So, is that- She's a yandere? What's going on? What's going on?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.400
What's going on?

31:53.400 --> 31:59.400
Microwave the tea. Do not speak again for the next 10 seconds and think about the actions of your words.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.400
Another one says microwave the tea! Are you mental?

32:03.400 --> 32:09.400
Mmm, no. I thought I was kinky, but microwave and tea? Mmm, too far.

32:09.400 --> 32:13.400
Okay, it's a game of three.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.400
We've got three gambas. What's wrong with the microwave?

32:16.400 --> 32:21.400
You didn't microwave tea, though. You can use the microwave as much as you want, but you want a cup of tea.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.400
I'm not having that.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.400
Your hit rate is- His box is really good. I've never seen that many hits before.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.400
Streamer luck.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.400
Another dodonzo.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.400
This is dodonzo.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.400
Okay, we have two more packs, and then we're going to alphabetize.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.400
You have a tea addiction, a gamba addiction, a zeal.

32:45.400 --> 32:49.400
They opened up that game that I played PCG Card Shop Simulator.

32:49.400 --> 32:55.400
They've released it early, and I'm like, mmm, I want to play it now, but I must wait for stream.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.400
I'm going to start fresh and then play through the game.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.400
I'm going to hire you to work in my little card shop.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.400
Oh!

33:06.400 --> 33:09.400
Is this the card you're looking for?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.400
Oh, it's not the card.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.400
Oh, yeah? Check your force, then.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.400
Exactly.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.400
A warm-in oven.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.400
I'm going to pour it in.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.400
Tutu?

33:31.400 --> 33:34.400
Lechonk, right here.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.400
Sharked it.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.400
Sharked it.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.400
What are you, a picnic?

33:41.400 --> 33:44.400
Oh, wait, it looks like it's got a coconut mask on.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.400
Oh, you're new.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.400
Ker-let-oh-bet-oh-piss, clobber-piss.

33:55.400 --> 33:59.400
Glob-clobber-piss? Any clobber-piss fans?

33:59.400 --> 34:02.400
Dom-fam, we know Dom-fam because that's an ashes team.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.400
Hey, that's my Dom-fam.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.400
Ne-mo-nans-backpack.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.400
Well, I don't know why she's lost it, but get it out of here

34:09.400 --> 34:11.400
because we've already got this card.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.400
Get it out of here.

34:13.400 --> 34:14.400
Okay.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.400
Oh, it's the evolution of the guy.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.400
Hello.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.400
You look like you're on the same team.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.400
They're the same player, right?

34:26.400 --> 34:29.400
It's a ground-type octagon?

34:31.400 --> 34:33.400
Huh?

34:33.400 --> 34:35.400
A ground-type octopus?

34:38.400 --> 34:39.400
Uh...

34:39.400 --> 34:41.400
No, they're feyin'.

34:41.400 --> 34:43.400
Oh, feyin'? Okay, okay, okay.

34:43.400 --> 34:44.400
That makes much more sense.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
Sorry, this is brand, so my brain's like...

34:46.400 --> 34:47.400
brand.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.400
If it's brand, then it's brand.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.400
Ooh, what are you?

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
Beth?

34:54.400 --> 34:55.400
Beth, what?

34:55.400 --> 34:58.400
Please, camera, I'm begging.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.400
Little?

35:00.400 --> 35:03.400
Why can't you see the upper skirt?

35:03.400 --> 35:04.400
Ah!

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
Oh, sorry, it's the next card.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.400
Hold on, hold on, hold, hold, don't get too exu-

35:08.400 --> 35:10.400
It's the next card, okay?

35:10.400 --> 35:11.400
It's the next card.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.400
Ah!

35:12.400 --> 35:13.400
Ah!

35:13.400 --> 35:16.400
Oh, my God, it's Meg Mortar!

35:16.400 --> 35:17.400
Ah!

35:17.400 --> 35:19.400
It's the super-evolution!

35:19.400 --> 35:21.400
Ah!

35:22.400 --> 35:24.400
Oh, yeah, baby.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.400
Oh, yeah, Mr. Krabs.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
We got it.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.400
Come on.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.400
Yeah, look at that.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.400
Volcanic Heat.

35:33.400 --> 35:36.400
Volcanic Heat is 170 attack, hold on.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.400
During your next turn, this Pokemon can't attack.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.400
Oh, it's a build-up.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
It's like Sunbeam.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.400
It's a build-up attack.

35:43.400 --> 35:48.400
Meg Mortar is an ugly basketball, isn't it?

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
Why did they make his lips like that?

35:50.400 --> 35:53.400
His lips were not that big in the pre-evolution.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.400
I know that for the fact.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.400
I've seen what you look like when you're wee.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.400
I've seen you when you're wee.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.400
You're gonna be like growing up with any like that ugly.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.400
So what's going on?

36:02.400 --> 36:07.400
Pokemon and making cute little Pokemon's fucking ugly.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.400
Challenge impossible-evolution.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.400
Sorry, that wasn't even a sentence.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.400
Bye-bye, thank you for hanging in.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.400
Please don't worry, you can't hang.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.400
This is a short stream today.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.400
It's not- it's not mega-

36:19.400 --> 36:22.400
uh, massive and finished in just a minute.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.400
Let's be honest.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.400
Is this a serious Pokemon opening?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.400
No, I've never done it before.

36:26.400 --> 36:30.400
I just always wanted to do it with my childhood wish.

36:30.400 --> 36:34.400
Okay, it's between purple or yellow.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.400
Pikachu and then.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.400
I mean, it's not that much damage these days.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.400
I have a card that goes to Jesus.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.400
You want purple?

36:44.400 --> 36:46.400
Short stream, next four hours.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.400
Let's go!

36:47.400 --> 36:49.400
Oh, and it's slow though.

36:49.400 --> 36:53.400
No, I dealt with the script writers.

36:53.400 --> 36:57.400
So, I had to, like, get my management to send on.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.400
There's two people I picked.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.400
And I'm, like, right.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
So there's been a message.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.400
As far as I'm aware, there's been emails,

37:06.400 --> 37:08.400
but only two people emailed,

37:08.400 --> 37:11.400
and there was, like, seventy-eight people wanting to write scripts.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.400
So, mm-hmm.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.400
Right, was there purple?

37:13.400 --> 37:15.400
Was there purple one?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.400
So, I was up dealing with that,

37:17.400 --> 37:19.400
so I've not had much to do, so I'll go apologize.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.400
And then we were playing G-Mod.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.400
Emperor Zurus couldn't fucking connect!

37:22.400 --> 37:24.400
I was raging!

37:24.400 --> 37:27.400
Um, I don't know why she couldn't connect to Sheevee.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.400
Sheevee was hosting four, and I was, like,

37:29.400 --> 37:31.400
oh, is it because you were hosting it, Stormy?

37:31.400 --> 37:32.400
No.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.400
No.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.400
And we were, like, trying so hard,

37:35.400 --> 37:38.400
but it just, it really could not get in.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
Oh, no, I've done it.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.400
Fuck, sorry.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.400
I pulled it out wrong.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.400
Oh, how?

37:45.400 --> 37:47.400
I have one job.

37:47.400 --> 37:51.400
I don't, I don't know what card it is.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.400
I think it might be this one.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.400
We're gonna do this.

37:56.400 --> 38:01.400
If we get spoiled early, that's completely on me.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.400
Yeah, we played offline.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.400
It wasn't a stream, no.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.400
And if we do end up streaming G-Mod,

38:06.400 --> 38:08.400
unfortunately I can't stream it on my end

38:08.400 --> 38:10.400
because the lag is too severe.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.400
And I was, like, a magic trick.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.400
Mm-hmm.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.400
Mm-hmm.

38:18.400 --> 38:21.400
No, I did not expect that much of a response on the list, right?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.400
Um...

38:23.400 --> 38:25.400
I don't know.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
My friend was, like,

38:26.400 --> 38:29.400
oh, you've got that many spoken words, right?

38:29.400 --> 38:31.400
Oh!

38:36.400 --> 38:38.400
We can...

38:38.400 --> 38:41.400
Right, no one saw that, no one saw that.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.400
No one saw that, right, no one saw that.

38:44.400 --> 38:47.400
Ooh, right, she's focused.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.400
Faincon?

38:49.400 --> 38:50.400
Is that your name?

38:50.400 --> 38:51.400
A faincon?

38:51.400 --> 38:53.400
No one saw that, no, don't laugh.

38:53.400 --> 38:54.400
Don't laugh.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.400
Are you gonna focus me?

38:56.400 --> 38:57.400
There you go.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.400
Faincon.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.400
Energy.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.400
Good.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.400
Fancy.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.400
Good.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.400
Lapras.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.400
Good.

39:07.400 --> 39:10.400
Moonlit hell, all right.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.400
Can't unwrap the finished numeral's evolution one

39:13.400 --> 39:16.400
unless you've got mega-evolutioned and

39:16.400 --> 39:18.400
you saw nothing.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.400
Pinnacle is gen 2.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.400
What?

39:21.400 --> 39:23.400
I haven't recognized him at all.

39:23.400 --> 39:26.400
Good luck on the first thing to you,

39:26.400 --> 39:27.400
Primi.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.400
Love you, darling, love you, Primi.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.400
Ecstasy?

39:30.400 --> 39:32.400
Okay, we've got ecstasy flying through.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.400
Pikachu.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.400
Pikachu.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.400
Oh!

39:37.400 --> 39:38.400
Oh my god!

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
Oh!

39:39.400 --> 39:42.400
Oh my god, I'm so surprised we got this card!

39:42.400 --> 39:44.400
Oh no!

39:46.400 --> 39:47.400
What?

39:47.400 --> 39:49.400
This didn't get spoiled a minute ago because

39:49.400 --> 39:51.400
I messed up the order?

39:51.400 --> 39:52.400
What?

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
No, what are you talking about?

39:53.400 --> 39:55.400
Oh my god, celebrate!

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
Yay!

39:56.400 --> 39:57.400
Wow, I never...

39:57.400 --> 39:59.400
No, I never expect that either.

39:59.400 --> 40:03.400
Only I could have messed that up without them.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.400
Okay, we got one of them.

40:05.400 --> 40:06.400
Each one.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.400
Wait, did we get another one of them?

40:07.400 --> 40:10.400
Hold on, I need to go through the special tile.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.400
These cards are special.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.400
Also, I've got a bone to pick for some of you reeflings.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.400
What's going on?

40:17.400 --> 40:19.400
Mummy needs to have a talk.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.400
What's going on?

40:21.400 --> 40:24.400
I've been getting a few marshmallows saying

40:24.400 --> 40:27.400
you feel really bad when you interact with me

40:27.400 --> 40:29.400
and you overthink and you think you're upset

40:29.400 --> 40:31.400
and you're annoying me.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.400
What's going on?

40:33.400 --> 40:37.400
Why are you overthinking interacting with me?

40:37.400 --> 40:39.400
What is going on?

40:39.400 --> 40:42.400
Why are you scared to interrupt?

40:42.400 --> 40:44.400
Everyone's like, I've had a couple of marshmallows

40:44.400 --> 40:46.400
that are apologizing for interacting with me

40:46.400 --> 40:48.400
because they feel bad about it.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.400
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

40:50.400 --> 40:53.400
The person that did the 9-11 joke.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.400
They're like, I'm so sorry I didn't meet up today.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.400
And I was like, no, I was getting a rise out of the joke

40:59.400 --> 41:03.400
because I said it so fast that I didn't think it.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.400
It was funny.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.400
And then I got another one that was like,

41:07.400 --> 41:09.400
I feel like you appreciate me.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.400
And I'm like, I'm sorry, this one.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.400
I thought I was doing good.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.400
I thought I was doing alright.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.400
You know, I've been in every day, having fun,

41:19.400 --> 41:23.400
looking through all the good things that come.

41:23.400 --> 41:27.400
We don't want to embarrass ourselves.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.400
It's a view of the reasons I have got it.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.400
Some got it.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.400
Open and put them on card packs.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
Some got it.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.400
Right, this is the last pack, so make it count.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.400
Brains until brain worms got hands.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.400
Yeah, and normally I thought I was defeating the brain worms

41:45.400 --> 41:47.400
before they could spawn in.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.400
That card is 9 gigabytes.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.400
Oh, you grabbed it?

41:51.400 --> 41:53.400
It's because you're super shy and you like it a lot.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.400
Oh, this one.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.400
You must brain break us not to think.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.400
Oh, well, if you put it that way.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.400
Oh, yeah.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.400
Oh, yes.

42:04.400 --> 42:07.400
You need your energy.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.400
Shark a bit.

42:08.400 --> 42:11.400
Right, for a fucking yambo?

42:11.400 --> 42:14.400
How many cards are in this bag?

42:14.400 --> 42:15.400
This is like...

42:15.400 --> 42:16.400
Bruh, I've seen you.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.400
Get over here.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.400
Are you new here?

42:21.400 --> 42:23.400
So many duplicates.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.400
I know.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.400
I know you're saying that I'm getting lucky with the pills,

42:26.400 --> 42:27.400
but the duplicates...

42:27.400 --> 42:31.400
Bruh, that's like the third or fourth time.

42:31.400 --> 42:33.400
You don't have people who are like, I get addicted

42:33.400 --> 42:35.400
and I just want to keep yamboing more.

42:35.400 --> 42:37.400
I get so fucking annoyed that I spend money on this.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.400
I'm like, mmm, you there or not?

42:39.400 --> 42:40.400
You there?

42:40.400 --> 42:42.400
Fucking shit that way.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.400
How many backpacks does this bitch have?

42:44.400 --> 42:46.400
I don't want to keep fucking buying more.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.400
Chronic lurker hurt.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.400
Here, can confirm I'm shy.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.400
Oh, don't feel forced to talk if you don't want to talk.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.400
So that's different.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.400
You just want to lurk that time.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.400
Artazone.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.400
Ooh, Skipplin.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.400
I don't know you, but it's nice to have you.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.400
Is that mine?

43:06.400 --> 43:07.400
Wait a minute.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.400
Oh, you can have two and a thing.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.400
Skipplin looks good.

43:10.400 --> 43:11.400
What?

43:11.400 --> 43:13.400
That was it.

43:14.400 --> 43:16.400
Oh, he's shiny as well.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.400
I'm fucking gambling again.

43:19.400 --> 43:20.400
What the fuck was that?

43:20.400 --> 43:21.400
That's fucking piss.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.400
Right, I'm going to put the specials away

43:24.400 --> 43:26.400
and then we're going to alphabetize.

43:26.400 --> 43:27.400
We're going to number them.

43:27.400 --> 43:29.400
It's shiny and a gender.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.400
Skipplin is gender?

43:30.400 --> 43:31.400
What?

43:31.400 --> 43:32.400
Am I going to meant?

43:32.400 --> 43:34.400
Right, I've not played the Gen 1 or 2 game.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.400
I'm sorry.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.400
I started at Ruby.

43:36.400 --> 43:39.400
I started at Ruby and then I did 4 and 5

43:39.400 --> 43:42.400
and then I couldn't do 6.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.400
So I'm only similar.

43:44.400 --> 43:45.400
You're wrestling.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.400
That's me with the polka dots.

43:50.400 --> 43:51.400
Horn good, yeah.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.400
Horn region is my region.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.400
The only reason, this sounds really bad,

43:54.400 --> 43:57.400
but the only reason I remember horn region is my region

43:57.400 --> 43:59.400
is because I'm horn me.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.400
Like, I'm playing the horn me region.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.400
That's what I remember.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.400
These were our pools.

44:07.400 --> 44:10.400
Let me just kind of zoom into it this way

44:10.400 --> 44:12.400
because this is like...

44:12.400 --> 44:14.400
This is harder than it looks.

44:14.400 --> 44:18.400
Not that I'm saying any special applause for doing this, okay?

44:18.400 --> 44:22.400
But this is not how I expected

44:23.400 --> 44:24.400
to go.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.400
I expected to...

44:26.400 --> 44:29.400
I expected to hardly even know her.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.400
My eyes, I'm sorry.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.400
The noyvern is pretty cute.

44:37.400 --> 44:40.400
I have to admit, noyvern is such a nice word to say,

44:40.400 --> 44:41.400
like noyvern.

44:41.400 --> 44:45.400
Like, it's a satisfying word to say noyvern.

44:45.400 --> 44:47.400
Ah, noyvern.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.400
Noyvern, noyvern.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.400
I started at Gen 1.

44:52.400 --> 44:54.400
So I got a special...

44:54.400 --> 44:57.400
Wugtrio and Neymona.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.400
A special art.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.400
Rainworms go.

45:01.400 --> 45:02.400
Mommy's love is here to stay.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.400
Aw, thank you.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.400
Hapsicum.gar for the extended membership.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.400
Thank you.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.400
I got a little...

45:11.400 --> 45:12.400
We got guard of hour.

45:12.400 --> 45:14.400
I'm really happy with guard of hour.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.400
I think if I have to be biased,

45:16.400 --> 45:18.400
noyvern and guard of hour

45:18.400 --> 45:20.400
are my favorite tools.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.400
Not... I'm not telling Sivirino.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.400
Um, my fellow mercs.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.400
I really like...

45:26.400 --> 45:27.400
Noyvern has a lot of HP.

45:27.400 --> 45:29.400
He's stacked out with HP.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.400
260 as well.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.400
It's just OP as well.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.400
140, 140, 120 health.

45:35.400 --> 45:38.400
Only 90 at that time.

45:38.400 --> 45:39.400
No.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.400
Are you squiddin' me right now?

45:41.400 --> 45:43.400
You're so weak, you little baby.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.400
Headbutt 30.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.400
Undersea tunnel.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.400
Flip three coins for each head.

45:47.400 --> 45:50.400
Guard of top three cards of your point is dead.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.400
Come here.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.400
Black blood.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.400
Thank you for the extended membership.

45:55.400 --> 45:56.400
Sunnybell.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.400
You can do more.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.400
Two eggs is a full art shiny egg.

45:59.400 --> 46:00.400
A full art trainer.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.400
Two shinies in an art rare.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.400
Pretty tall box.

46:03.400 --> 46:05.400
There's so many Pokemon.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.400
Play the TCG win.

46:07.400 --> 46:10.400
Oh, I feel like I'm gonna make a fill on myself though.

46:10.400 --> 46:13.400
I feel like I'm gonna make such a...

46:13.400 --> 46:15.400
a guberino of myself.

46:15.400 --> 46:17.400
Cause I don't know what we're gonna do.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.400
I'll maybe need to research some videos.

46:20.400 --> 46:25.400
I found a video game that I wanted to play for an ASMR.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.400
Like pre-recorded ASMR.

46:27.400 --> 46:30.400
Some people do that stuff when you do ASMR videos.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.400
There's 1,025 Pokemon.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.400
Okay, I recognize about 300.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.400
Take your leave at...

46:35.400 --> 46:36.400
Royce.

46:36.400 --> 46:40.400
This is the bit where I don't really know how to progress.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.400
And the reason for that...

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400
Pre-recorded?

46:43.400 --> 46:46.400
No, I pre-recorded ASMR stuff.

46:46.400 --> 46:49.400
This is where I don't know how to progress, for the most part.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.400
I want to numerically number them.

46:52.400 --> 46:56.400
But I need to like place down...

46:56.400 --> 46:58.400
like 1 to 10.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.400
I don't even know how big this deck is.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.400
Wait.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.400
This deck is 91, not including the hidden.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.400
Can you see that?

47:06.400 --> 47:07.400
Oh, please do this.

47:07.400 --> 47:11.400
It says this is card 39 out of 91,

47:11.400 --> 47:14.400
not including the hidden.

47:14.400 --> 47:20.400
So, I don't know if I should put them in the tiles for now.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.400
Like that's the third tile.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.400
This is 90, of course.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.400
So what?

47:26.400 --> 47:27.400
Like 1...

47:27.400 --> 47:29.400
So let me back up a little bit.

47:29.400 --> 47:34.400
So like 1, 2, 3, and then 9's down here.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.400
This is 5, so that was over there.

47:37.400 --> 47:38.400
50.

47:38.400 --> 47:39.400
This is 71.

47:39.400 --> 47:42.400
So like here in the 7, that's 6.

47:42.400 --> 47:43.400
Do you know what I mean?

47:43.400 --> 47:45.400
Is this the best way to do it?

47:45.400 --> 47:48.400
And then I'll put it in the book at that way.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.400
Back it up, yeah.

47:50.400 --> 47:55.400
See, this is 4, so this would be at the start of the deck.

47:55.400 --> 48:02.400
16, so that would be 0, 10, 4, 8, 8.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.400
So yeah, there you go.

48:03.400 --> 48:08.400
0, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.400
And then specials will go right where my head is.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.400
Let me make myself smaller.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.400
Oh, let me make myself smaller.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.400
Aw.

48:19.400 --> 48:22.400
You're massive.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.400
You like my socks?

48:23.400 --> 48:24.400
Is this the comfy?

48:24.400 --> 48:26.400
Yeah, I got them at the asylum.

48:26.400 --> 48:27.400
Man, they released me.

48:27.400 --> 48:28.400
I don't know why.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.400
They just had another name.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.400
Fuck this.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.400
50?

48:34.400 --> 48:36.400
Oh my god, look at them.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.400
Concert and things like that.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.400
The Griffey Gryffindor.

48:41.400 --> 48:45.400
Well, you never had heads on a V2 Gryffindor before?

48:45.400 --> 48:47.400
What's going on here?

48:47.400 --> 48:49.400
That's 14.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.400
51.

48:51.400 --> 48:56.400
This is the best way I can see it in my head to do it.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.400
Like the most efficient way when I'm putting them away.

48:59.400 --> 49:01.400
That says 8.

49:01.400 --> 49:06.400
6, 7, 8, 9 specials increases when that's through the balls.

49:06.400 --> 49:08.400
I hear cracking.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.400
What?

49:09.400 --> 49:12.400
Wait, cracking in my mind?

49:12.400 --> 49:14.400
Would you be the first?

49:14.400 --> 49:17.400
I'd like to be the first, but you're here.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.400
I do like cherries.

49:19.400 --> 49:22.400
Do you like cherries?

49:22.400 --> 49:25.400
6, 7.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.400
1, 2.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.400
What's the first 2?

49:29.400 --> 49:34.400
It's the routine you're doing to me.

49:34.400 --> 49:38.400
Oh, Panko is the first card in the 6.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.400
They always start with grass-papes.

49:40.400 --> 49:42.400
You can do grass-papes that much.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.400
Fancy for you.

49:44.400 --> 49:49.400
3, 4.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.400
The rest, thank you for coming.

49:51.400 --> 49:53.400
Remember, please enjoy the emotes.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.400
I'm getting new emotes soon, I promise.

49:55.400 --> 49:57.400
I'm waiting for an update with the emotes.

49:57.400 --> 49:59.400
They're not really doing much.

49:59.400 --> 50:01.400
And I've been waiting so well.

50:01.400 --> 50:05.400
It's not above 50%.

50:05.400 --> 50:11.400
Yeah, the specials seem to be at the end of the deck.

50:11.400 --> 50:16.400
No, they would be kind of the 4.

50:16.400 --> 50:21.400
2, 3, and 4.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.400
What's my cherry? Can you help me find it?

50:23.400 --> 50:26.400
No, no, no. I've picked the cherry.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.400
You'll never get it back.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.400
Hmm.

50:30.400 --> 50:32.400
I've got to work now. Good luck and have fun.

50:32.400 --> 50:33.400
Thank you.

50:33.400 --> 50:35.400
As I said, it's a very short stream today.

50:35.400 --> 50:38.400
Please do not be getting straddled in.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.400
I assure you the only straddling is me.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.400
Straddling for a paddling.

50:42.400 --> 50:45.400
I do think I'll have Ace more tomorrow.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.400
There'll be a new Ace more video.

50:47.400 --> 50:50.400
My Patreon is also going to get an update.

50:50.400 --> 50:55.400
I can either do a police officer,

50:55.400 --> 50:57.400
do something to your P-Sport,

50:57.400 --> 51:01.400
or I can do a different role play.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.400
Take care, leave it.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.400
The cherry, mine, thank you.

51:06.400 --> 51:10.400
No, that is...

51:10.400 --> 51:12.400
Chinnicle.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
I love Chinnicle.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.400
Right now, I'm mercy a little bit for some reason.

51:16.400 --> 51:20.400
I don't know why I'm just like that adorable nature.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.400
Flip a coin.

51:22.400 --> 51:24.400
Is what I mentioned was useful.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.400
It's only the cherry trigger.

51:26.400 --> 51:27.400
Honestly!

51:27.400 --> 51:29.400
I'm not going to be extra haunted,

51:29.400 --> 51:31.400
which I'm not mad about. I don't mind haunted.

51:31.400 --> 51:33.400
Iona, you can pop off.

51:33.400 --> 51:36.400
We've had enough of you for quite some time.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.400
I have to admit, was there...

51:38.400 --> 51:41.400
Iona, we see you quite a lot,

51:41.400 --> 51:45.400
and we're not really that fast to see you that much.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.400
It was nice.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.400
Well, it lasted.

51:49.400 --> 51:53.400
I mean, it was through 8-6-6.

51:53.400 --> 51:56.400
Then we were given them two.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.400
Sonya, I'm begging you.

51:58.400 --> 52:02.400
You only got a few more hours if you're the 2D weekend.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.400
It's only a few more hours.

52:09.400 --> 52:10.400
I should...

52:10.400 --> 52:14.400
I either have a hands-cam video where I'm tapping on the girls.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.400
It's just a rambling ASMR.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.400
You guys seem to enjoy my rambling ASMR,

52:19.400 --> 52:21.400
and because I don't have to write a script,

52:21.400 --> 52:23.400
it doesn't need to be performed a certain way.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.400
I don't mind making it.

52:25.400 --> 52:27.400
Like, I'm playing a happy music now.

52:27.400 --> 52:28.400
Seriously.

52:28.400 --> 52:31.400
So it's like a rambling tapping on each...

52:31.400 --> 52:33.400
It's like with my nails, with my fake nails.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.400
I've got five days.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.400
I'm happy my music.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.400
The projector!

52:41.400 --> 52:43.400
Two days left in this season.

52:44.400 --> 52:46.400
Your rambling is really soothing.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.400
Yes!

52:49.400 --> 52:51.400
I'm glad because...

52:53.400 --> 52:55.400
Not in a lazy way.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.400
It means I have less work to do.

52:57.400 --> 53:01.400
A lot of pressure is taken off where it's like...

53:01.400 --> 53:03.400
You don't need to write a script because you know me.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.400
I'm already behind.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.400
How much energy cards do they give you?

53:06.400 --> 53:07.400
Look at these.

53:07.400 --> 53:08.400
Energy, energy.

53:08.400 --> 53:11.400
And then they already gave me...

53:11.400 --> 53:14.400
Here is this entire pack full.

53:14.400 --> 53:15.400
Remember it.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.400
That's how much I hate it.

53:17.400 --> 53:19.400
I've already lost it.

53:20.400 --> 53:21.400
I've already lost it.

53:21.400 --> 53:22.400
That's how much I hate it.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.400
What?

53:23.400 --> 53:24.400
I'm getting fluff on me.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.400
Don't look.

53:25.400 --> 53:26.400
There's fluff on me.

53:29.400 --> 53:32.400
They really stuff me so it's tiny.

53:35.400 --> 53:36.400
I wonder...

53:36.400 --> 53:37.400
Oh, that's the seven?

53:38.400 --> 53:40.400
That would still be it, right?

53:40.400 --> 53:41.400
Yeah.

53:41.400 --> 53:42.400
Get my tails of it.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.400
What's the one here?

53:43.400 --> 53:44.400
What's the one?

53:44.400 --> 53:46.400
That's a team.

53:47.400 --> 53:50.400
That's 51...

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400
49.

53:51.400 --> 53:53.400
That's 69 brain loss.

53:54.400 --> 53:56.400
And then her backpacks which are...

53:56.400 --> 53:57.400
Plenty.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.400
Nope.

53:58.400 --> 54:00.400
Yeah, we do not need any more backpacks.

54:00.400 --> 54:02.400
I assure you we are...

54:02.400 --> 54:04.400
Hitting down for backpacks, really.

54:05.400 --> 54:06.400
No.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.400
No seriously.

54:07.400 --> 54:08.400
We do not need any more.

54:08.400 --> 54:09.400
Is that it?

54:10.400 --> 54:12.400
And then we've already sorted through all the cards?

54:13.400 --> 54:14.400
Oh well.

54:15.400 --> 54:16.400
We are efficient.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.400
You can call us reeflings many things.

54:19.400 --> 54:22.400
We are efficient when we know what we're locking in.

54:22.400 --> 54:23.400
Mummy, have my first.

54:23.400 --> 54:25.400
Oh, we got your super cherry.

54:25.400 --> 54:26.400
Your super cherry.

54:26.400 --> 54:29.400
Thank you, big ol' boy.

54:29.400 --> 54:32.400
For the super cherry.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.400
It's May now.

54:33.400 --> 54:34.400
You can't get it back.

54:34.400 --> 54:35.400
I'm fine now.

54:35.400 --> 54:39.400
Mummy, yappin' is like the news for old people can't live without it.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.400
I think it is.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.400
Thanks for having that Susan rambling in the backpacks.

54:43.400 --> 54:44.400
Hey mama, just got here.

54:44.400 --> 54:45.400
You can hear that.

54:45.400 --> 54:49.400
I'm ecstatic to record ASMR about having just quiet myself down.

54:49.400 --> 54:51.400
I submitted a sample script.

54:51.400 --> 54:55.400
Will I receive any feedback if I wasn't chosen or if I was?

54:55.400 --> 54:57.400
When you whisper...

54:57.400 --> 55:00.400
Like it's quite damaging to your voice.

55:00.400 --> 55:04.400
Which I'm used to now.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.400
I'm used to my voice.

55:05.400 --> 55:09.400
When I do ash from pallet town, this genuinely hurts my voice.

55:09.400 --> 55:15.400
But I understand that it's going to be okay and it will heal up.

55:15.400 --> 55:23.400
But whispering pain of death not only takes the men to meet as well.

55:23.400 --> 55:25.400
So there's a lot of 20s.

55:25.400 --> 55:26.400
What's going on?

55:26.400 --> 55:27.400
It's all 20s.

55:27.400 --> 55:32.400
Again 21.

55:32.400 --> 55:33.400
78.

55:33.400 --> 55:35.400
This was a very...

55:35.400 --> 55:37.400
So we got rare cards.

55:37.400 --> 55:41.400
But I will admit the repeats are killer in this deck.

55:41.400 --> 55:42.400
That's it.

55:42.400 --> 55:45.400
That's us already ready to adjust into the good.

55:45.400 --> 55:46.400
Brian got ignored.

55:46.400 --> 55:47.400
Oh sorry.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.400
Hold on.

55:48.400 --> 55:49.400
Hold on.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.400
I can't.

55:50.400 --> 55:51.400
I don't have my headset on.

55:51.400 --> 55:52.400
I'm reading.

55:52.400 --> 55:53.400
Look, you can even get a little football.

55:53.400 --> 55:54.400
Yeah, you like that football.

55:54.400 --> 55:55.400
I'm a ballerina.

55:56.400 --> 55:57.400
Shilin.

55:57.400 --> 55:58.400
Hey mom, I just got here.

55:58.400 --> 55:59.400
How's the script for everything going?

55:59.400 --> 56:00.400
I'm a lot curious.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.400
I'm a bit disheartened for the script.

56:02.400 --> 56:06.400
But we'll ever see any feedback if I was chosen or not.

56:06.400 --> 56:07.400
When will I know?

56:07.400 --> 56:09.400
So two people have been emailed.

56:09.400 --> 56:15.400
We're waiting on them to send their response script.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.400
And then we'll take it from there.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.400
Thank you Shilin for the morning.

56:22.400 --> 56:23.400
Can I say that?

56:23.400 --> 56:24.400
Yeah, I do.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.400
No, they've been emailed.

56:25.400 --> 56:30.400
So only two people were emailed and there was like 76 applicants or something like that.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.400
So please don't be like, oh my God.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.400
Shilin.

56:33.400 --> 56:36.400
Like, oh, I got debated.

56:36.400 --> 56:38.400
I thought it was an unopened part.

56:38.400 --> 56:40.400
Oh my God, I got excited there.

56:40.400 --> 56:43.400
Yeah, third time.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.400
Sorry Brian.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.400
Brian got yaps out.

56:45.400 --> 56:46.400
I'm sorry.

56:46.400 --> 56:47.400
I'm sorry.

56:47.400 --> 56:49.400
Do you want me to repeat it?

56:49.400 --> 56:50.400
I can repeat it.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.400
Hi mom, how are you?

56:51.400 --> 56:52.400
I'll repeat it.

56:52.400 --> 56:55.400
But yeah, look at that leg.

56:55.400 --> 56:56.400
Look at that.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.400
You see me tensing it up?

56:58.400 --> 57:00.400
Right there.

57:00.400 --> 57:01.400
Brian, your turn.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.400
Are you squiddin' me right now?

57:03.400 --> 57:06.400
Hey mama, just got here.

57:06.400 --> 57:08.400
How is the script writer thing going?

57:08.400 --> 57:10.400
I'm a little curious but shy.

57:10.400 --> 57:12.400
I submitted a sample script.

57:12.400 --> 57:16.400
Will I receive any feedback if I wasn't chosen or if I was?

57:16.400 --> 57:18.400
When will I know?

57:19.400 --> 57:22.400
Brian finished?

57:22.400 --> 57:24.400
Good boy, Brian.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.400
Thank you for saying that again.

57:26.400 --> 57:29.400
Oh yes, they've already been emailed.

57:29.400 --> 57:35.400
I'm waiting on the responses from it.

57:35.400 --> 57:37.400
I'm going to get a bit closer to you if that's okay.

57:37.400 --> 57:39.400
Please don't freak out, okay?

57:39.400 --> 57:42.400
I know I'm a real woman but it's okay.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
I'm also like you.

57:44.400 --> 57:47.400
So don't overthink your interactions together.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.400
I'm born like you, okay?

57:50.400 --> 57:52.400
I'm born like you.

57:52.400 --> 57:54.400
Thank you, mommy, for blessing my eyes and ears.

57:54.400 --> 57:56.400
How many submissions?

57:56.400 --> 57:58.400
It was like 76 or something like that.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.400
It was a lot.

57:59.400 --> 58:04.400
Okay, so this is the only way I can see it being done.

58:04.400 --> 58:06.400
So I've picked out.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.400
These are all the cards that are one to ten, okay?

58:09.400 --> 58:11.400
So we literally go like...

58:11.400 --> 58:13.400
This is the first page.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.400
Did I even have number one?

58:15.400 --> 58:16.400
Number two.

58:16.400 --> 58:18.400
So literally number one, right?

58:18.400 --> 58:20.400
Fuck.

58:20.400 --> 58:22.400
This is harder than I thought.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.400
And these cards are in the way.

58:24.400 --> 58:25.400
I can't believe it.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.400
I never thought...

58:27.400 --> 58:29.400
Wait, no, no, no.

58:29.400 --> 58:31.400
Hello?

58:31.400 --> 58:34.400
Are you there?

58:34.400 --> 58:35.400
Okay, there we go.

58:35.400 --> 58:36.400
It's double-sided.

58:36.400 --> 58:38.400
I thought that.

58:38.400 --> 58:40.400
Then it goes one.

58:40.400 --> 58:42.400
And then we'll just take it from there.

58:42.400 --> 58:46.400
This is the banger at the end of how full or empty it is.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.400
Hmm.

58:47.400 --> 58:48.400
That was funny.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.400
I love your content.

58:49.400 --> 58:50.400
I'm glad you can catch me live.

58:50.400 --> 58:51.400
I'm so sorry.

58:51.400 --> 58:53.400
This is like the worst stream to catch me live.

58:53.400 --> 58:56.400
I'm just rambling.

58:56.400 --> 58:59.400
I can't fit it in me.

58:59.400 --> 59:00.400
Oh my God.

59:00.400 --> 59:01.400
What?

59:01.400 --> 59:03.400
That's so cool.

59:03.400 --> 59:06.400
There's like a secret thing here.

59:06.400 --> 59:07.400
Oh my God.

59:07.400 --> 59:08.400
Hold on a minute.

59:08.400 --> 59:11.400
I'm starting to understand why Pokemon cards collect.

59:11.400 --> 59:12.400
A bit addictive.

59:12.400 --> 59:14.400
Hold on a minute.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.400
Oh no, that's satisfying.

59:16.400 --> 59:17.400
Oh.

59:17.400 --> 59:20.400
Oh, that's satisfying.

59:20.400 --> 59:21.400
I'm sorry.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.400
Hold on a minute.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
Hold on.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
Hold the phone.

59:24.400 --> 59:26.400
What do I do with duplicates?

59:26.400 --> 59:28.400
Well, I'll put them in a separate pile.

59:28.400 --> 59:30.400
I'll put duplicates in a separate pile,

59:30.400 --> 59:33.400
and I'll send it to Ariflin for the doughnuts on.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.400
How about that?

59:34.400 --> 59:36.400
You can have all my duplicates.

59:36.400 --> 59:37.400
Nine.

59:37.400 --> 59:40.400
So it's like one, two, three, four,

59:40.400 --> 59:43.400
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.400
Like, that's how we do it, right?

59:46.400 --> 59:47.400
Oh my God.

59:47.400 --> 59:50.400
The dopamine all along was putting it in the binders.

59:50.400 --> 59:52.400
It wasn't pulling the card.

59:52.400 --> 59:54.400
It was, oh my God.

59:54.400 --> 59:55.400
Tell me.

59:55.400 --> 59:56.400
Oh, sorry.

59:56.400 --> 59:58.400
That is so fucking satisfying.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.400
I'm getting dopamine hits, like fucking turning the damn thing.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.400
Now, as I said, there's a very high chance

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.400
of you seeing my face this stream.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.400
Look.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.400
It is what it is.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400
Put it back in.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.400
It's still good.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400
No problem.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400
You just eat what you want to.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400
Right.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.400
So then we're on the teens.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.400
We've got 14 to 18.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.400
We've got 11.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400
That's a good one.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.400
Right.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.400
We've got 11.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.400
So nine, 10, 11.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.400
Huh?

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.400
Oh my God.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:32.400
That's so satisfying.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.400
What the fuck?

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.400
I'm making a game right now that is just putting stuff in the binder.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400
And I put you in the two mills.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.400
I am trying so hard to get you a good shot.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400
Oh, hold on.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.400
If I can, like, put you in the two mills.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.400
And then we get Nemo, which is evolutionist camera.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400
Because he can't erupt.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400
So there's lava on the back.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400
Oh, my God.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.400
The binding of us at once.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400
Well, Pikachu is a wispy.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400
So put it in the wispy pile.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.400
Sorry.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.400
This is so hard.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.400
Right.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400
You know what?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400
You know what?

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400
Right.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.400
Everyone calm down.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.400
Let's move the fucking cars back in two by two.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.400
I need a better camera angle, people.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.400
Come on.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.400
Think of the shot.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.400
Think of the money shot.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400
Will you?

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400
Jeez.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.400
Any.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.400
Keogreful.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.400
Keogreful?

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.400
Keogreful?

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.400
Keogreful.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400
Okay, there.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400
Is that looking right up at my face?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400
I think it is a little bit.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400
That's it.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.400
It is what it is.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.400
Is that me?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.400
In this one?

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.400
Is that me?

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.400
No.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.400
What do you think?

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400
I have no idea.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400
Right.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.400
Okay.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.400
I think I'm going to have to, like, swivele around.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.400
Oh, no.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400
That's going to make it even worse.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400
The odds have increased of my face being shown.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400
Fuck.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400
Fuck.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.400
Fuck.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400
Oh, well.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:01.400
Yeah, well, wrap it up.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:02.400
Right.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.400
Okay.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400
Numeral is 12.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400
So, you got...

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400
Oh, this is really hard to do.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400
I'm so sorry.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.400
This is very unoptimized.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400
If numeral is 12, we have 14.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.400
So, I guess we'll do 13.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.400
12.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.400
13.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.400
14.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400
Wait.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400
Yes.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.400
No.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.400
Wait.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.400
Hold on.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.400
Hold on.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400
Hold on.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.400
Hold on.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400
Hold on.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400
Hold on.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.400
Hold on.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400
Hold on.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.400
Hold on.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.400
Hold on.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.400
Hold on.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.400
Hold on.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.400
This is what I'm seeing.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.400
This is what I'm struggling with.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.400
I can't do numbers.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.400
Well...

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.700
Yeah, and then next page, it would be 13.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.700
Here.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.700
And then 14 here.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.700
Okay.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.700
Sorry.

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.700
It's very slippery.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.700
It's rather slippery.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:45.700
I can't squeeze it.

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.700
How can I do it?

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.940
I mean, I want to be thebanger in the LA.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.940
Wait.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.940
Can I put you in between lines?

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:51.940
Is that easy?

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.620
I don't know if that's easier or more difficult.

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:53.620
Oh.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.620
Well, if I squeeze it, it's actually a lot easier to do and go all the way through.

01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:02.940
squeeze it it's actually a lot it's gonna hold okay so that is 14 and then

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:12.620
that's a repeat that's fine and then we've got 14 we don't have 15 but we have

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:29.620
16 17 14 15 16 and then we literally you get in the

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:35.820
second crushing fruit a bit early this is so hard

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:58.260
find out shortly that was 17 and these are duplicates and there's a 17 18 to

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:03.900
Pikachu so we're already on electric tape like what yeah like look how many

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:21.420
fucking gaps we have oh that's rough that is rough for a banger

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:31.540
need more gambas to sell the beans or I think that's how they're trying to get

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:42.340
you right this says so that's 18 right Pikachu is 18 and then we've got 21 18

01:04:42.340 --> 01:05:01.340
19 20 21 have 22 whoa wait a minute my dumb not to have like a funny thing on

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.420
him like that hypnotist stuff well it has nothing on the car it's not to a

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:34.580
secret thingy put 52, 23, 24, 25,

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:42.580
Yeah, like all the sides. Yeah! Oh my god, what do you think? What do you guys think?

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:52.580
Okay, five, six, six, six, seven. That's fine. Oh, this is point two. Point one.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:59.580
You get this. It's not shiny. It just looks slightly different.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:06.580
Even with my naked eyes, it's in point 22, 22.

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:11.580
I'll show a big up close at the end as well, so please don't worry.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:19.580
You're a Reefy in the city town. And in this 1819, 20, gorgeous stunning.

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:22.580
We're getting a bit more filled out. I love it.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:27.580
Oh my gosh, this is speaking to me.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:31.580
Right, that's pointy one. So we've got a Reefy. Oh! Yeah, look!

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:35.580
That one's different from that one, but this one's better.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:42.580
So it's got the actual beef over it. That's going in the duplicate pile, and this one's from here.

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:48.580
So you think you could ever professionally compete one day with a dick?

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:53.580
I mean, I could compete whether or not I'd fucking win in the different questions,

01:06:53.580 --> 01:07:00.580
but that's no harm in having a room tie dealer. Thank you for the three months extended membership.

01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:06.580
No, there's absolutely no way. I could professionally fucking have a dick. Are you joking me?

01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:12.580
I pick dicks. I pick my Pokemon based on do they look kawaii desune or not.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:17.580
I'm not even going to hide the fact that I do. That's how I pick my dicks.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:23.580
Are they cute? And you come. That's how I do it, okay?

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.580
Yeah, and she definitely is complete.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.580
That's right. I picked them at their kawaii name. Right. What are you?

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:37.580
But I really cannot see that fucking number. Don't be afraid to make it bigger next time.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:42.580
Twenty-eight. Twenty-nine. Thirty.

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.580
Do I have thirty?

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.580
I have thirty-one. Wait, let's get you in there.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:52.580
Thirty-one. Gorgeous, stunning.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:58.580
Oh, do you have thirty? Lovely. We love to see it. We love to...

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:02.580
We love to get in there. Thank you.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:08.580
That was thirty. Thirty-one, thirty-two. We got thirty... thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-two.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:13.580
Wait. Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-two.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:18.580
Sorry, I don't... I'm not very... You know, you know how it is, right?

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:23.580
You know, spondin'. I kind of spawned in as a girl.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:31.580
I might not have the best kind of attribute, but as long as I try my best, right?

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:37.580
That's what counts, even if I am dumber than a bunch of rocks.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.580
I'm just here for a good thing.

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.580
Thirty-three, and then that's thirty-five, which is correct.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:55.580
And then I've got thirty-eight, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight.

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.580
You've got a little pinch, just like you pinch the ball for.

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.580
And just do that with a little pinch, so there's nothing else that guys do.

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:07.580
And I was absolutely sponded when I saw a meme about it.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:14.580
Alright, that was thirty-nine, so we're hitting them with a forty right off the bat.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.580
No pun intended, you know.

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:22.580
And then forty-one, ooh, got a little clean slate going here.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.580
Wait, what?

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:31.580
Apparently guys have to pinch and roll their sack in order to itch it, and I saw it in a meme.

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.580
And I was dumbfounded.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:36.580
I forgive me.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:39.580
I was not familiar with your game, gentlemen.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.580
I was not familiar with your game.

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:48.580
Right, forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six.

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.580
Big gap.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:50.580
Big gap.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:53.580
I understand the gamble and the drive.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:58.580
Oh, that's a good, good gap, and doesn't have to text on it that long.

01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:00.580
Accurate.

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.580
Would you let me do it with my nails?

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.580
Come on, let me, let me pinch and roll for you.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:10.580
Come on, let me do it with these nails.

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.580
Yes?

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.580
No, you scared of the nails?

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.580
Scared they're gonna hurt?

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:18.580
Someone sent me a marshmallow, they were like,

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:22.580
I'm starting, I don't mean to be asked such a personal question.

01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:28.580
But I had to do it with those nails, and I'm like, well, see, I have the same post.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.580
This is the peril, okay?

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.580
And this is the nails.

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.580
They have, they have not, the nails don't cut the peril.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.580
It's not necessary.

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.580
Just, just so you shouldn't have, you know.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:49.580
Oh, whoa.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:52.580
Wait, no, I've not finished that deck yet.

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.580
We've got two duplicates, so that's okay.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:11:03.580
And we've got Fampy and Dumfam, so that's 46, 47, 48, me, and 49.

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.580
And we're on the 50s.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:08.580
And we're like, why is it so sad that I'm still not a vendor?

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:11.580
Like, I'm so happy right now.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.580
Educational marshmallow?

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:16.580
Honestly, I don't mind educating.

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:21.580
I'd rather you ask me than never know at all, and like,

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.580
or be embarrassed to even try and learn.

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.580
Like, it's nice that you're even, like, curious enough to ask.

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.580
And it's like, well, listen to how it works.

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.580
Don't worry about it.

01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:33.580
If you didn't know, because how are you supposed to know?

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.580
How are you supposed to know?

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.580
No, seriously, how are you supposed to know?

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:38.580
If you don't know better, how are you supposed to know?

01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:40.580
That's a duplicate.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:46.580
Haunter, these, actually, there's no difference between these.

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:52.580
So, I've got 57 and 56, and we've just done 52.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:12:03.580
So, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:08.580
I'm afraid we didn't get ghastly, so we did not complete the game for everything,

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.580
which is a little unfortunate that we didn't really lose.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.580
Thank you for watching over.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.580
Some of us have much to learn.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.580
Oh, is that a cherry, I say?

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:20.580
Are we up to date on marshmallows?

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.580
No, I've not looked at marshmallows.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.580
You're gonna shit yourself, why?

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.580
I'm sure you're not.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:31.580
57, 58, 59, 60.

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.580
Okay.

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:39.580
And then, as long as there's no scraggie, that's sort of, you know,

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.580
that's 60, sorry.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.580
Sorry for some of my face there, no, I don't care that much.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.580
Unfortunately, I do have a face.

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:50.580
60, 61, 62.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.580
Hold on.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:04.580
And then your duplicate, and then it was 61.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.580
You're 62.

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:08.580
You're 61.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.580
And you go, don't fight it, you're getting put away by me.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.580
Okay, this one's the better version.

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580
This is 64.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.580
62, 63, 64.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.580
It's very satisfying when you mean the bottom ones again.

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.580
Not seeing anything like this on, I guess.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.580
Day one of the marshmallows.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.580
It's trying to put, oof, steady on.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.580
I think I've killed them enough for one, two.

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:38.580
40, 68.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.580
What are you?

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:46.580
64, 65, 66, 57, 68.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:47.580
Gorgeous.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:48.580
Stunning.

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.580
68.

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:50.580
I must remember.

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.580
This is 69.

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.580
80.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:57.580
60, 70.

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.580
71.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.580
And we're just going to double check that math pencil,

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.580
because I'm not ready to do that.

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:11.580
60, 69, 70, 71.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:14.580
And that's a duplicate.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.580
Please stop playing.

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.580
Oh, please stop playing.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.580
This is why you were getting thigh locked earlier.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.580
That was 71.

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.580
So we've got 76, 79.

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.580
Okay, hold on, let's do the math.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.580
Are you ready?

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.580
Are you ready?

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:38.580
71, 72, 73, 74, 75.

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.580
And then it goes 76 here.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:44.580
God, that gap is very difficult.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.580
And then it goes 77.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.580
Oh, Jesus, we are getting there.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.580
We are getting there.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.580
Who said pick this one?

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:02.580
And then 78, 79, like that.

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:06.580
And then if we have...

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.580
Oh, I've mixed this.

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:11.580
I've mixed this last pattern.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.580
Oh, well, we're not as...

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:17.580
Should have been me, not the binder.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.580
Thank you for having us.

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:22.580
Please don't worry, today's a much shorter stream.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.580
Literally, once I put this away, we're going to take a look,

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:26.580
and then I was so much in my loop.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:29.580
And I believe she'd be streaming.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.580
And you can read her out there into her for once,

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.580
because I always end up missing her.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:35.580
I feel really bad.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:41.580
80, 81, 82, 83.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.580
Crying at that backpack.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.580
There's no unique...

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.580
On that.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.580
I'm just checking.

01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.580
Oh, there's a unique one, this Iowa.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.580
And the backpack, right, outcome.

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:54.580
No, I'm not having an outcome.

01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:55.580
See that?

01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:00.580
The backpack at least has the unique little markings on it.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.580
Iona, for you too.

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.580
Who said get nails?

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.580
Fuck sake, I can't get nails.

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:10.580
Out and...

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.580
I think I put more clothes on my dad.

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.580
There's nothing else in here.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.580
I think there was loads of knockoffs, like,

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.580
fastened day.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:26.580
79, 80, 81.

01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:28.580
So...

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:31.580
A little bit more filled out than originally.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:34.580
I don't want to do that.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.580
That's what she said.

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:38.580
Who are you?

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.580
83.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:42.580
What?

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.580
Oh, that's a duplicate, Iona.

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:48.580
84.

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.580
I was like, that's not possible.

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:52.580
How can there be two of the same?

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:57.580
84, 85, 86.

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:02.580
Okay, and then the last card.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.580
90.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:04.580
What was that?

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:06.580
86.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.580
87, 88, 89, 90.

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.580
I'm not off my board.

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:16.580
That's how empty your fucking desk is.

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:21.580
I'm not sure how it feels about that.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.580
Is this how we get you in?

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.580
Is this how they suck you in?

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:29.580
It's not very filled out at all.

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.580
Dear.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.580
We've got greens, a lot of grass pipes.

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:38.580
And then, yeah, gaps all over.

01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:40.580
Oh dear, this is how they suck you in.

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.580
I've not put these guys in.

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.580
That put them in the binders?

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:48.580
Are they going to fit?

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.580
Like, that put these guys in the binder?

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.580
How do you do it?

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.580
Buy more colourful cardboards.

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.580
I don't know.

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.580
Look out of Rudigan's number.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:04.580
What?

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:08.580
Oh my god, can you see that?

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:13.580
224, hidden out of a 91 deck.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.580
Are you serious?

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:20.580
This is 224 in a hidden deck?

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:23.580
What?

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.580
This deck is 239 cards.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.580
And I've got this many fucking duplicates.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:34.580
Excuse me, there's 239 cards.

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.580
Excuse me, there's 229 cards in the deck.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.580
And I get how many duplicates?

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:45.580
All duplicates, by the way.

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.580
All duplicates.

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.580
No way.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.580
That's insane.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:01.580
See, being told that doesn't make me want to go gambling.

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:04.580
That makes me want to quit, because like...

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:09.580
If that was my booster packs, and these are all duplicates,

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:12.580
how you need me, you know?

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.580
Literally, that's how they need to buy more?

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.580
No!

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.580
I'm sorry, but they've lost me.

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:26.580
They've completely lost me after that.

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.580
Are you serious?

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:38.580
Like, that's more than probably what was put in the fucking poker deck,

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:41.580
not to be my poker deck.

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.580
Like, your poker deck is bigger than mine.

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:44.580
I don't know what to say.

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.580
I'm feeling emasculated right now.

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:49.580
Clearly bigger than mine.

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:50.580
Oh, there we go.

01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.580
I found the energies, as if that wasn't enough.

01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:55.580
Here's a bunch of energies that no one asked for.

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:56.580
Just print the...

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:57.580
Fucking just print the cards.

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:58.580
Put them in the bag, bro.

01:19:58.580 --> 01:19:59.580
Put the fries in the bag.

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.580
Just put the cards that I want.

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:03.580
Oh my gosh.

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.580
Very hard.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:07.580
And so that's why some Pokemon cards go for like a hundred bucks,

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.580
because it's such a very cool tool.

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.580
Thanks for the compliment.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.580
Oh my god, it's called a V-Tuber.

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.580
Sadly, I am real.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.580
I'm breaking all the V-Tuber rules.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.580
Before you get excited and click subscribe,

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.580
I do break a lot of V-Tuber rules, okay?

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.580
I'm not supposed to acknowledge that.

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.580
I'm piloting a mess.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.580
Yeah, look at that.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.580
Empty.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.580
Empty.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:31.580
I don't like that.

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.580
That's wrong.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.580
I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.580
I had fun putting these cards away.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:37.580
I was getting a bony.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.580
Like, I was getting erect.

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.580
Putting that away, but...

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:43.580
We got...

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.580
I can't even...

01:20:48.580 --> 01:20:49.580
Yeah, look at that one.

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:50.580
Holy shit.

01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:53.580
One.

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.580
Out of eight on that page.

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:56.580
One.

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:58.580
Oh no, two.

01:20:58.580 --> 01:20:59.580
Sorry.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:00.580
Two out of eight.

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:02.580
V-Tuber rules.

01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:03.580
There's rules.

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.580
I mean, there's unwritten V-Tuber rules.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:06.580
Like, one of them is like,

01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:09.580
don't acknowledge your pilot and a metha.

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:12.580
I used to get told off for that so much.

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.580
Don't acknowledge your...

01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:17.580
using your emotes or whatever you're looking for.

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.580
Then...

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:20.580
I'll send you a chat.

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.580
Hello.

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.580
This is our polka debt.

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:27.580
I'm not really beating anyone with this, to be honest.

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:31.580
Can these fit inside the...

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.580
If these can fit, maybe...

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.580
can these fit whilst still in the packet?

01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:39.580
You might look a bit better if I can do those.

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:42.580
I don't know if they can fit with staying in the packet.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.580
Oh, please.

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:44.580
It's invisible.

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:45.580
Okay, it's invisible.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:46.580
Oh, it can.

01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:47.580
Okay, okay, okay.

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.580
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:50.580
Don't write me out yet.

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:51.580
Don't write me out yet.

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:54.580
Don't write me off just yet.

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.580
I've got 24 here.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.580
10.

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.580
11.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:01.580
12.

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.580
13.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.580
14.

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.580
15.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.580
16.

01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:06.580
Wait.

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:07.580
18.

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:08.580
Executor?

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:09.580
Oh, there.

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:10.580
Executor?

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:11.580
Hardly.

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.580
I'm not sure.

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:13.580
I almost showed my face on screen.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:14.580
Right.

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:15.580
Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:16.580
Hold on.

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:17.580
Let me put my specials in.

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:18.580
I didn't realise they could fit.

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:19.580
You know, it's a tight squeeze.

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:20.580
How was that specific?

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:26.580
Oh, it's struggling on the bottom one.

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.580
Is that in?

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.580
No, I'm just going to get schizophrenic now.

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:30.580
Oh, it's not in.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.580
Hello, I'm thinking of do it again.

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.580
I'm so sorry.

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:40.580
Ooo, slide them in gently.

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:41.580
It is tight.

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:42.580
I'm not even kidding.

01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:43.580
That is tight.

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:44.580
I'm gently...

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.580
I don't want to bend the card.

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.580
I'm really tight.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.580
I'm really tight.

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.700
I don't want to bend the card or anything. I am gently.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.460
Well, I've done it now, haven't I?

01:22:58.740 --> 01:22:59.340
Okay.

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:01.940
Ooh.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.060
Ooh.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:05.980
That was tight.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.420
147 special.

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.620
229 is Nemona.

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:17.300
Tentacruel, 213.

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.460
224.

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:20.980
69.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:23.020
Nice. You have 69.

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.500
Just look for Neubat.

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:27.900
Where are you, Neubat?

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:28.860
69.

01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.820
You look cute, Stanky Bean.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:34.900
69. There you are. So this one will go up to y'all.

01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:38.220
I'll give you a big...

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:45.900
Sound right, I've got 16.

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.980
Of course I would. Mummy, you're losing it.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:50.140
It's just Corpheon.

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:52.060
Fucking...

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:55.740
Look how empty it is. I'm feeling a muscular lookie.

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.380
I'm trying to be like, all cute and stuff.

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.980
I love it. They're pretty rough.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.340
Is anyone who have a Phil Pokemon collection here?

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.940
It's an expensive hobby, I feel.

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:15.020
This is 97.

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:20.620
90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97.

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:25.660
You're cool. I'm putting in orders if I'm going to finish this deck.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.220
Stanky Bean, 23, I do not have that kind of money.

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:29.580
Nor would I want to spend it.

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:30.620
Like, I'd rather have like...

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:32.140
I wish...

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:37.660
There must be Pokemon Gambo, but with less filler, right?

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.220
Surely there's someone who's like, well, cut to the chase.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.300
Yeah, it's a bit rare, but it's not that rare, you know?

01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.460
Like, I want to cut to the chase.

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.580
A bit different, you know?

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:50.620
Why, something on your name, Jason?

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.820
Is that what the bill says?

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:54.460
That's strange.

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.740
What would stop you from doing what you want to do?

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:08.620
90, 90, 89, 88.

01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:09.100
Stop it.

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:11.900
Look gently.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.820
Tease teaser.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:16.300
Mm-hmm.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:19.260
This way, I might let you guys do it.

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.180
Right, gently.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:24.860
Come on.

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.660
No, I haven't forgotten that I need to take bulls.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.140
Before anyone's like, have you forgotten?

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.180
No, I have not forgotten.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.180
40.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.860
Okay, back here.

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:36.140
40, that's 50.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.900
Is this 40 on the shoulder?

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:40.780
It is.

01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.580
Oh, I have a spacey and a duplicate.

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:49.980
Right, I'll take out this one, and I'll give it to Ari Fling.

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:51.820
Ari Fling, huh, Ari Fling, huh.

01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.500
Chicken fried chicken, Ari Fling, huh.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.260
Ari Fling, huh, Ari Fling, huh.

01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.300
Shawnee needs to take her team, I don't think.

01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.580
I'm going to extend my way, can you get up?

01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.740
Sorry, this blanket has too much fluff that comes off of it.

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:10.220
And then the blanket.

01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:11.180
This is 70.

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.180
Still bizarre.

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:16.300
I've not had my book door.

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.180
I was there.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.180
I even bought the webcam a bit too far.

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.900
Oh, I forgot my fucking mattress here.

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:22.220
Oops.

01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:24.140
Ta-da.

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.660
That's how I say hi to you.

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:26.140
Hello.

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:27.900
Hello.

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:28.860
Hi, hi, hi.

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:30.620
Shawnee, hi, hi, hi, hi.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:31.180
Hi, Shawnee.

01:26:32.700 --> 01:26:35.660
So, I had to pick it up, or else it couldn't see my face.

01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:36.700
But now you can see my face.

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.300
I didn't realize I forgot.

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:42.540
Okay, 69, 70.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:45.020
Hmm.

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:46.380
Is that a leg?

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:46.940
I know.

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.220
I'm not in a wheelchair, popular to...

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:55.020
Contrary to popular AI artwork.

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:02.700
Oh, right.

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:05.660
And then are these numbers like the outrageous ones?

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.100
No, this is 87.

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:10.140
That's not outrageous.

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:13.580
88, 87.

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:22.220
And then now it's the ridiculous numbers?

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:26.220
147, 2, 2, 9, 2, 1, 3.

01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.620
Do I even have that many slots?

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:29.900
Right.

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:32.380
You're gonna have to walk through the math, okay?

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.340
We're my boy up.

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:35.420
97.

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:35.900
Right.

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:36.460
Everyone.

01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.460
Shhh.

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:40.860
I need shushes from across.

01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:41.980
And this is gonna be terrible.

01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:46.860
97, 98, 99, 100.

01:27:47.740 --> 01:28:03.580
101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116.

01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:32.940
117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135,

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:36.780
The following is a fact from UK-classified government documents.

01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.700
Their accent isn't natural.

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:43.260
It's given a replenished by various brands of tea they drink daily.

01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:47.500
If you drink tea daily, you'll develop one of the four accents.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.100
Spread the word before they.

01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:54.300
514, 6147, yay!

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.420
You missed one?

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:56.300
Did I actually?

01:28:58.460 --> 01:28:59.340
Wait, did I miss?

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:04.700
Did I miss?

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:07.660
No, they're fucking with you?

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:07.980
Okay.

01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:12.220
And that brain surgeon alloy you fucking with?

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:16.060
Stop fucking with me.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:16.300
Right.

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:17.180
What did Brian say?

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:17.740
Hold on a minute.

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.740
Oh, excuse me for sawing my phone.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.300
Brian's Edward Snowden.

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:29.820
The following is a fact from the UK-classified government documents.

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:31.180
The accent isn't natural.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.220
It's given a replenished by various brands of tea they drink daily.

01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:38.140
If you drink tea daily, you'll develop one of the four accents.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:40.220
Spread the word before they.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:40.620
Huh!

01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:43.740
Yeah, that's right, British Edward Snowden.

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:44.780
Get done for.

01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:49.500
You're either Northern Irish, you're Irish Scottish,

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.300
you're either Welsh, or you're either English.

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:55.660
England, school's not that good else.

01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:56.620
Okay.

01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:00.540
Thank you very much for the tip as well.

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:03.100
How could you forget?

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:05.180
Okay, 147.

01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.500
Right, but it's not over yet.

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:08.540
Okay, we have two.

01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:11.420
We have two 13 first.

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:11.740
Okay.

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:14.060
Are you ready?

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.180
I hope you like counting.

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.660
And it's not going down.

01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:18.780
Sure you.

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:26.460
Right, 147, 148, 149, 150.

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:35.500
150, 152, 153, 154, 156, 178, 9, 6.

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:36.940
Hold on.

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:48.700
6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 8.

01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:54.700
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 9.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:31:23.580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 200, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 210, 210, 210, 211, 212, 213.

01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:26.220
Yeah.

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:29.420
Can 13 even be in this position?

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.980
I don't know if what we're doing.

01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.540
I think I had, I did it.

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:35.820
I think that's correct.

01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:37.980
Two 13.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.020
And then thank the fucking maker.

01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:46.780
These are for 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:57.180
21, 22, 23, 24, right.

01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:06.620
And then last but certainly fucking least because I've had enough of you.

01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:12.940
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and then 29.

01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:15.900
And we're done with put the deck away, no duplicates.

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:21.740
Oh, that was so fucking hard.

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:27.580
I wish, Tina, why is it so hard putting away Pokemon cards?

01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:31.820
Can't we just count the pages and multiply by four?

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.380
There, my deck is done.

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:37.740
Now we can look at my deck.

01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:41.420
You want to come over in my house and look at my deck?

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:43.580
Oh, no, like my actual Pokemon deck.

01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:44.380
I just borrowed it.

01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.420
So I'll put it behind you.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:52.700
Right, are you ready?

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:55.820
I'm going to present to you.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.780
There are many polka decks in the world, but this one's mine.

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:04.780
There you go.

01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:10.540
Well, it's empty.

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.900
Yeah, I'm buying mine.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:25.660
I'll show you if I was saying deck as fucking set, straight, we don't be pussyfooting around

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:30.460
these bushes trying to invite you to our house to show you her deck, but you heard it wrong.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:35.100
Oh, no, you accepted coming over to see foot on me.

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.220
And then it never happened.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:41.260
You're like, so when you pulling it out and I was like, oh, I don't know.

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.460
You're in a Pokemon like that.

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:44.700
I thought you're more of a Yu-Gi-Oh fan to be honest.

01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:46.060
I'm sorry.

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:47.340
Well, I'm familiar with your game.

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.380
Oh, I love my wee haunted.

01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:53.660
I wish I could have got my wee ghastly as well to finish their line.

01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:54.220
But you know what?

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.540
We got Ralts's line, so I'll kind of do that now.

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:00.940
She's pulling her cock out.

01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:02.620
Wait, she's pulling her cock out.

01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:16.460
And then we get to the special part and for no particular, look how far away the next card is.

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.500
It's so covered.

01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:23.980
It's so covered, it's so far away, literally all over here for the next one.

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:30.460
And then for the next one, the other two are only visible because they are in special little pockets.

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.940
Who fucking made these?

01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:38.460
That is ridiculous, honestly.

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:39.580
That's ridiculous.

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.940
It's donkulous.

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:46.380
They are special, and then two more.

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:46.700
One.

01:34:48.540 --> 01:34:50.940
And then last, but certainly not least.

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.420
Apparently she's a rare pearl, so maybe I shouldn't be so mad.

01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.940
And the ultimate key is ridiculous.

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:01.420
Right, where's her?

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:07.100
I want to see my Ralts's line though, because I always play Ralts in the Pokemon movie.

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.860
I always have a guard there, I always hold her super safe, so there it is.

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:12.060
There it is, I'm coming.

01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:15.500
Look at that.

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.020
My Ralts's line is complete.

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:21.340
Imagine raising a Pokemon to be used for breathing stuff.

01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:27.260
Very nice.

01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:29.580
Very, very nice.

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:30.140
I get it.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.140
He's the martial in my deck.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.700
Did somebody mention Vaporeon?

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.380
No, mommy wants to be Guard of Air, bro, Guard of Air is such a sex symbol.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:47.100
I don't care what anyone says, I'm such a sex symbol.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:52.780
My large face.

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.140
Where my pack's good.

01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.100
I kind of got rip-fozled a little bit.

01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.820
So these were my duplicates.

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:03.900
Like, that's pretty fucking stacked.

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:08.060
For duplicates, that is, that's rough.

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:12.220
A discount guard of our design for Gen 2?

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:15.260
No, we don't, sadly.

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:23.020
Yeah, that's duplicate, that's rough.

01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:24.700
Like, you can see how thick that is.

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:31.820
Like, I don't know if you have a Pokemon card for scale, just to see how thick this stuff is.

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:34.220
How about Gen 3 Guard of Air?

01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:35.260
Do you want us to guess it?

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:41.100
Dick torture, yeah.

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:44.220
Is it torture when I play this game?

01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:48.060
Yeah, sick chunky boy.

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:51.980
End point, best, isn't it?

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:53.580
Just don't call it Guard of Air, bro.

01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.300
I should do my Pokemon deck through this one.

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:04.540
Yeah.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:08.300
So that's my agendination, I think.

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:13.260
The other stuff, just in case someone didn't clean all the coins, I'll show them again.

01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:16.540
And then I'll read Marshmallow.

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:32.380
Okay, so put one, put two, three, ignore the, ignore the discarding system, okay?

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.820
Just in case someone didn't grab them.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:42.540
Ignore the discard system, don't, don't, what are you, what are you focusing on?

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.540
Oh, what are you doing?

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:51.980
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, identify yourself.

01:37:53.660 --> 01:37:55.660
You're making a mess, oh no.

01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:00.220
Should I not be making a mess right now?

01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:07.260
So if you play the online game, you're more than welcome to clean all of those coins.

01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:08.940
That is not a problem for you.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:11.660
No problem at all.

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.140
Is there anything else?

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:19.420
A little player's guide, if you want to take a look at it, boom.

01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:21.580
Oh, look at that.

01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:25.260
I don't like when they do art like that.

01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:29.500
I hate the fucking, how do you call it 3D?

01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.220
I don't like that.

01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:35.980
Pokemon are supposed to be, what?

01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:37.660
It actually teaches you how to play.

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:39.980
I mean, it is a guide, right?

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.100
Colorful combos.

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.620
Cyborg for a mulling.

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:50.540
Espertha X is the angry, and it's Cyborg your opponent's Pokemon in the face.

01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:51.020
What?

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.580
Build metal strategists, make it rain energy card when you Pokemon with

01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:11.500
gold den or gold den goes, new lavish hospitality attack.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:16.140
Pokemon like Metal X from Scarlet and Violet are amazing.

01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:18.940
Obsidian Flames often have attacks that benefit.

01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:22.140
Are these our specialty cards?

01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.140
I've never had any.

01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:26.300
Moonlight Hill has eyes.

01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:31.420
Psychic decks get a new play through with Moonlight Hill, and there's no one better

01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:37.900
to take advantage of the stadium cards than Garderbummer X, who debuted, oh my god,

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:38.860
Beach of Arreol?

01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.140
Gen 3 Villar leaks?

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:46.060
Please tell me, you can read that says debuted, right?

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:54.380
Debuted in the Scarlet and Violet expansion, and now reappears in Scarlet and Violet halogen states.

01:39:54.380 --> 01:40:00.460
Moonlight Hill, Moonlight Hill can help put basic psychic energy cards in your

01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:05.020
discard file and heal damage incurred by psychic integrity.

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:07.740
Actually just confirmed?

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.980
We got both of those cards, I do.

01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:15.100
Oh, just to rub it in your face?

01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:17.980
Oh my god, just to rub it in your face?

01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:19.660
They show you what you could have had.

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:23.820
I never even got Mimic, oh no, I did get Mimic C before, anyway.

01:40:24.860 --> 01:40:28.460
I did get Mimic C, sorry, let me pop Mimic C in there.

01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:30.940
Hold on, hold on, I forgot about Mimic C.

01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:34.060
Mimic C was a special card, because look, we came in and we packed it.

01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.340
Sorry, hold on, I forgot about Mimic C.

01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:40.940
You know, you know the whole point of the box and the design?

01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:42.700
Yeah, sorry, I forgot about that.

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:45.580
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, I forgot about him.

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.820
And this is not holding him.

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:48.940
Deck appeared in the first place.

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.620
Doesn't wear glasses, has zero dents, perception.

01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:00.620
I will go through what we could have had, okay?

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.620
I think it somehow had the perfect deck.

01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.540
Oh, I love Mimic C, the safe card.

01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:16.220
Prevent all damage done with Pokemon by the attacks from your opponents.

01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.740
Who the fuck is Pokemon V?

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:24.300
I've never heard of Pokemon V.

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:25.900
Who's Mimic C?

01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.180
Oh, he's right behind me.

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:29.660
It's perfectly behind me.

01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:31.500
Right, 70, are you 70?

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.300
You're 75, right, go back to the book.

01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:37.100
75, hold on, hold on, something's there.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:39.340
What are you?

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:43.340
68, 69, okay.

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.100
70, two, three, four, five.

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.100
Here we go, little Mimic C's having a go.

01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:57.500
There, now it's complete.

01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:03.980
I'm 75, I'm Mimic C, 75.

01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:06.140
Right, okay, let's rub it in.

01:42:06.140 --> 01:42:08.540
Rub it in, let's rub it in, this is what we could have had.

01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:11.100
Oh, Jesus.

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:18.220
Oh my God, they have shiny, these are the shiny variants as well.

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:19.740
Get to fuck, man.

01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:23.900
There's no way you can organically buy a deck.

01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:26.540
Like, via Gamba.

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:29.180
Via Gamba?

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:31.340
There's no way.

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:35.420
Hyper rear, shiny rear, shiny ultimate rear, above it.

01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:36.940
This fucking post, yeah.

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:41.820
Uncommon, common standard of Ruth.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.940
This is what, let's just pretend this is not Pokemon.

01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:56.300
Oh, I can't imagine if we had that though.

01:42:56.300 --> 01:42:57.820
Oh, and all the ghost tape.

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:01.580
Oh my God, what are you?

01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:03.660
A whipper ghost tape?

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.100
Lord Shire?

01:43:09.420 --> 01:43:10.140
Who's who?

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:13.180
Oh, the normal tapes, yeah, we had like one normal tape.

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:15.820
You look like Mimic C.

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:20.940
This is what we could have had, got any stars, can you say?

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:23.260
I'm sorry, I'm afraid to.

01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:28.060
Oh wow, we could have had Abra on the hidden deck.

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:28.860
Fuck the hell.

01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:34.140
These hidden decks are insane.

01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.900
Holy shit, they have Padichur?

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.380
Lunatic Luxio?

01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:40.620
Randomly just chilling out?

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.260
He's like, yeah.

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:42.940
Abra's in the deck as well?

01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.180
What?

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.180
Who's who to forget about?

01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:50.380
Like, who's actually feeling so shiny on the screen?

01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:55.500
You're actually, you're expected to find out if he really, really likes Mudhip and

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:58.860
pray to him 50 Mudhips would all be true and rare.

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:03.420
Oh my God, that Mimic C.R. is so good on this one.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.340
Holy shit, he's got a failed comma.

01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:12.300
I love creepy little things, okay?

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:16.060
I love creepy little things, they're so fucking cute.

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:19.500
They're so cute.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:20.620
Hawaii Disney.

01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:23.420
Oh look, they're there.

01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.460
I got the first one.

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:29.980
You got money to spend?

01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:33.580
That's what I'm saying, who has this money to spend?

01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:34.460
That's insane.

01:44:35.980 --> 01:44:38.220
Oh no, that was the ultra rare?

01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:41.260
There was the other variation of that trick?

01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.820
Sorry, I don't see what you're talking about.

01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:46.700
Do you think this is something different?

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:49.180
That looks like something different.

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.100
Muse in a bubble?

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:52.700
Yeah, well man.

01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.460
Oh, that's the one we got.

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.300
Sorry, Nemona, this is the one we got.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.580
Are we things creepy little things?

01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:02.860
You are a wordable little thing, do you think?

01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:05.260
God, there's a fucking God there especially.

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:07.180
But yeah, that goes for some fucking money, huh?

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:10.300
I don't know what these are, I don't think this is good.

01:45:11.340 --> 01:45:12.140
God?

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:13.180
It looks like God.

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.780
Tengu, Wu, Qian.

01:45:18.060 --> 01:45:19.340
Wait a minute, what?

01:45:20.540 --> 01:45:22.700
Qian Yu, Qian Tao.

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:24.860
Wait, is Nihong good at?

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.100
I'm afraid I don't speak Chinese.

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:31.500
Are these being named after Chinese things?

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.900
Poraidon, Maradon.

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:38.300
It doesn't look like Pokemon, but it looks pretty open.

01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:40.540
Oh hi, thanks for coming.

01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.060
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:46.460
Okay, right, let me read some marching novels

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:48.300
and then we'll be directing the series.

01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:48.940
So let's go on.

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:56.220
Okay, what do you...

01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:58.380
Quick, eat a card, please.

01:45:58.380 --> 01:45:59.180
Do not eat a card.

01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:00.380
You can have a video, please.

01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:02.300
So, okay, hold on, adjust your volume

01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:03.900
because I'm not at the microphone.

01:46:04.860 --> 01:46:07.260
And yeah, well man, what are you doing?

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:09.660
I'm adjusting the table.

01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:15.100
Griffy salts, hey, yeah.

01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:18.460
Hell yeah, apparently, Griffy salts are real mean

01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.260
and I didn't know that.

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:21.020
I just really like to take a look at it.

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:26.540
Okay, let's see about redirecting into Shibu.

01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:29.500
And before Shibu's not screaming, I'm gonna cry.

01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:31.420
Please tell me she's screaming.

01:46:31.420 --> 01:46:32.460
I miss her all the time.

01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:34.620
Right, let me say cheeky redirect.

01:46:35.260 --> 01:46:35.740
Oh yeah.

01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:37.180
And then we'll read...

01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:44.780
Is my headset...

01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:46.060
Oh, is that me making my...

01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:47.420
Hold on, I think I can hear myself.

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:48.140
Is that me?

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.340
I think there's something...

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:52.460
Is it in my headset?

01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:55.020
It's a member stream.

01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:55.820
Are you joking?

01:46:55.820 --> 01:46:58.220
I can't fucking hit Shibu ever.

01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:00.620
What do you say?

01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:05.260
No way I can't redirect into Sheepster's.

01:47:06.700 --> 01:47:09.580
I'm like, oh, I finally do a stream where I wrap it up.

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:10.700
She's not screaming.

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:13.500
Oh god, she's in a collab later.

01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:16.460
Oh well.

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:18.220
Oh my god.

01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:20.140
Sorry, I'm just so nervous.

01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:21.980
Let me rub my little feet together.

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:23.500
I'm so nervous about you.

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:26.140
I got to go.

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.740
Shibu actively avoiding me.

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.100
Confirmed, yeah.

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:34.780
Oh, her weight rooms aren't up either,

01:47:34.860 --> 01:47:35.900
so I couldn't redirect.

01:47:39.100 --> 01:47:40.380
The other feet.

01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.380
Right, let me...

01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:44.220
Is there anyone we can redirect into?

01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.180
Well, I'll read Marshmallows.

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:49.580
So it's actually, the Marshmallows are the most important things

01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:51.100
for wanting to get your facts right.

01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.220
I'm getting my facts right.

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:53.100
I'm also getting them wrong.

01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:53.580
Fuck you.

01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:56.780
And I'm allowed to get them wrong, okay?

01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:01.660
I guess we're not redirecting into any...

01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:01.980
Well...

01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:07.420
So, unless Emmy has her weight room up,

01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:08.540
we can redirect into Emmy.

01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:09.740
Yes, I'm going to send you into a stream

01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:10.460
that's two hours away.

01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:11.500
No, I don't care if he...

01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:12.700
Does Emmy have her rooms up?

01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.660
I'm going to cast this particular torsion on the girls.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:21.420
I can't redirect into anyone.

01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.300
Right, Marshmallow time.

01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:26.380
Strongly wish you more luck on your pools.

01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:27.820
The next card stream?

01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:28.940
I'm not gambling.

01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:30.860
I'm not doing that again.

01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:34.060
Mummy, your hospital socks are adorable.

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:34.940
Do you like them?

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:37.740
National Zoom.

01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:40.380
Better tours away for Emmy than...

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.820
Their weight rooms aren't up,

01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:42.940
so I can't redirect.

01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:45.340
Wait, Emmy's streaming today?

01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:45.900
Is it?

01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.420
And I'm looking at the calendar.

01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:49.900
It says, strongy, 4am,

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.740
she be 6am members.

01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:53.980
Yes, I'm leaking fucking veiler secrets.

01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:56.460
Then it says, she be chained together with Emmy

01:48:57.340 --> 01:49:01.420
So Pralto and Vivian Bloss for part two with Emmy.

01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:02.140
She be an Emmy.

01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:07.420
As long as you don't cast Andrometriosis,

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:09.500
I think Griffie thought, would it feel good?

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.660
I mean, I could put coconut oil on them if you want.

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:18.380
Hi, Mummy.

01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.820
I tried applying for the script writer section,

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:20.940
but I never got the prompt.

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.180
No, you didn't get the prompt unless you were accepted

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:24.140
into the next stage.

01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:26.220
That's why there is no prompt.

01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.300
You're just to give your portfolio

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:32.380
and give a quick about you or your interests or what not.

01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:35.340
No, there was no prompt given.

01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:37.420
The prompt's given to those who made it on

01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:39.660
to test their resolve.

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.380
Anime style.

01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:41.820
I need to test your resolve.

01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:44.140
Oil on Griffie thought?

01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:45.180
Because what will it become?

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:49.100
Mercy has one off in seven hours.

01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:50.940
Her uneye-curved cure, are you okay?

01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:53.340
Yes, I will redirect you into a stream

01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:54.300
that's seven hours away.

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:56.060
No, I will not apologise either.

01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:58.940
Do you like the way my toes can bend?

01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:01.660
I'm always like ready to run.

01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:04.460
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.260
No, wait, what?

01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:21.260
Bend them around my tentacle.

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:22.620
Very straightforward.

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.340
Oh no.

01:50:24.300 --> 01:50:24.940
Right.

01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:25.740
Redirect.

01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:26.300
Merchie.

01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:27.580
And then I'll read the marshmallows

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:28.700
and we can chill for the rest.

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:35.340
If I may be a forward young leafling.

01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:38.220
Maybe please get a pure unfiltered

01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:39.740
brain rot earworm stream.

01:50:39.740 --> 01:50:42.380
Oh, like where I just keep saying the stuff

01:50:42.380 --> 01:50:43.500
that my brain says?

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:46.460
I'm not sure you're gonna want that.

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.540
I get very annoying very quickly.

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:51.580
Do you walk on your toes a lot?

01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:56.700
I bend my feet like this part of my feet

01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:57.260
at the toes.

01:50:57.260 --> 01:50:59.980
I bend them a lot like all the time

01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:01.100
my feet are bent.

01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:02.940
They're either pressed up against something

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:05.180
or bent and sorry, I just realised

01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:06.780
my hand was covering my face.

01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:12.060
Sorry, let me recalibrate my tracking.

01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:12.780
Real beautiful.

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:14.380
Hello.

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.500
Tell me much better.

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.460
Sony, can't annoy us.

01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:20.060
I'll be the best stream.

01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:22.220
Do you also walk upstairs on bent toes?

01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:28.300
I used to walk upstairs on all fours

01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:29.740
because it was so much faster.

01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:36.540
I don't know if I've unlearned that yet.

01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:38.540
I don't have stairs where I am.

01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:43.580
But I think I still go upstairs on all fours.

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:46.460
Like if I was back at my family house.

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:51.180
I'm like 99% sure I still run upstairs on all fours.

01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:53.340
Some decrepit dog.

01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.220
Like I kid you not.

01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:58.620
Like I'm chasing you out the stairs.

01:51:58.620 --> 01:52:00.300
Like some fucking dog.

01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.740
If I was chasing you out like nipping your ankles

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:04.540
on the way out.

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:09.260
I could see that.

01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:10.220
I could see that.

01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:16.220
I slowly talk about G-Mod in Pre-Chat

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:17.980
and I got hit by a wave of nostalgia.

01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:20.060
Yeah, that was the first time I ever played G-Mod.

01:52:20.060 --> 01:52:21.580
Glad to hear you've all enjoyed it with girls.

01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.180
I'm a bit surprised to hear you can't stream the game

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:23.900
without lagging.

01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:29.580
The lag was out of control with the ping and the delay.

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:31.580
Like I showed the girls how bad it was

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:34.140
and I was like standing in the corner for 20 seconds

01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:34.940
waiting to move.

01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:35.980
Like it just wasn't happening.

01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:41.740
Shawnee chases you up the stairs

01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:43.180
to put you to bed ASMR.

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:45.260
That would be terrifying.

01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:48.620
Like oh I get scared of like the idea of being chased.

01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:52.220
You know people are like oh I like pre-hunter type stuff.

01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:55.500
I'm like I'm fucking absolutely fucking terrified.

01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:56.300
Do not chase me.

01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.820
I'll start screaming.

01:52:57.820 --> 01:52:59.500
Okay you heard that scream yesterday

01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:00.700
in the Subnautica stream.

01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:03.180
Like I do not take chase and lately.

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.380
Is the members Overwatch VOD gone forever?

01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:08.380
It can't come back on the channel

01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:09.820
due to what happened in it.

01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:12.140
I do have the full VOD.

01:53:12.140 --> 01:53:14.700
I don't know what to do with it.

01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:16.220
Well it was just too much.

01:53:17.100 --> 01:53:18.380
Is the bottom line?

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.940
I mean I could maybe just put on blue sight later

01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:22.140
once we actually use it.

01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:27.020
The screaming is half the fun.

01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:30.380
I hear that stream still in mind.

01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:33.020
Did anyone stream Gmod?

01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:34.780
No we were just playing together.

01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.140
Shawnee is the monster that appears

01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:41.260
when you turn the lights off.

01:53:48.780 --> 01:53:51.020
Mummy I would interact more such as

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:51.820
in the stream snipes

01:53:51.820 --> 01:53:53.100
what the reeflings are there for your

01:53:53.100 --> 01:53:55.020
lovely voice if they heard mine

01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:57.180
would all turn gay like the pinpals.

01:53:57.820 --> 01:54:02.300
Oh is this reefling confident in their voice?

01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:05.980
You need to come on the mic next time.

01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:06.780
What's going on?

01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:12.300
We've got a cocky reefling up in here.

01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:15.740
We've got a non-R wordable reefling

01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:17.740
confident in your what?

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:20.540
Get on the mic and the next stream snipe.

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:22.060
We want to hear it okay.

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:26.300
No pressure making those claims

01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:28.460
around these parts partner okay.

01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:31.020
Private reefling brother.

01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:32.700
Shawnee calling your buff reefling.

01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:35.100
So I'm sitting here watching stream

01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:36.140
and pitching a tent.

01:54:36.140 --> 01:54:36.460
What?

01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:39.260
Oh the denial got me messed up.

01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:40.780
I was going to say I was like to the feet.

01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:43.900
I was like excuse me.

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:45.340
I mean if you like it that much

01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:46.300
I can do a little dance for you.

01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:47.900
Oh wait.

01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:48.380
Can I do it?

01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:52.460
How does Billie Jean is not my love?

01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:57.180
She's just a girl who thinks I am my heart.

01:54:58.460 --> 01:54:59.500
Oh shit.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:02.940
But the kids are my shine.

01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:04.780
What happened during the out stream

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.140
are you meaning to ask?

01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:07.740
What happened?

01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:08.460
What happened?

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:14.620
There were consequences if you lost on

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:16.620
Overwatch with me okay.

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:18.380
That's the best way I got.

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:21.660
That's the most brunt brute force way

01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:22.300
that I can say it.

01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:23.740
Thank you Broly legend for the tip.

01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.900
That is the most brute force way I can say it.

01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:31.340
If you lost your game then you lost the ability to

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.580
pre-stream dance was true Scottish dance.

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.180
No you're not.

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.780
You can't be a vodling yet.

01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:40.620
Not until the stream is over.

01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:43.260
Vodlings are illegal until the stream is over okay.

01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:47.340
The consequences aren't real without the vod though.

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.940
I mean I still have it on my desktop.

01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:49.260
Shit.

01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:50.380
You want me to open up the file?

01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:52.940
You want to hear it?

01:55:57.340 --> 01:55:57.820
Here's me.

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:00.140
Oh my god.

01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:00.780
Meal and stream.

01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:02.940
There you go.

01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:03.900
I got the full vod.

01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.180
So I don't know what claims you're coming out with.

01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:08.940
Nice try though.

01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:11.020
It was initially 480s.

01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:12.380
It was a mis-input.

01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:13.180
Hi strongy.

01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:16.460
Most people that buy the cards want duplicates

01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:17.740
because they play the game

01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:19.900
and you need multiple for making decks.

01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:27.660
How they are but it is makes this fucking hell

01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:28.860
can't read your English.

01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:31.740
How they make but is right you.

01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:35.260
I have problems reading English.

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:36.860
You had problems typing English.

01:56:36.860 --> 01:56:39.420
So together the combination isn't working

01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:41.420
but it's okay there's other parts of our body

01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.780
that'll work together just fine.

01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:43.340
I assure you.

01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:45.980
The strongest cards on the rarest

01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:48.940
making people spend more money,

01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:51.340
spend more money to try and get the dupes they need.

01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:51.580
Okay.

01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:52.780
Yeah.

01:56:52.780 --> 01:56:53.180
I tried.

01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:54.540
We both tried.

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:54.860
Okay.

01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:55.500
We both tried.

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:56.620
We're having a stroke together

01:56:56.620 --> 01:56:57.740
but not like that.

01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:58.380
Hey moment.

01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:59.100
Random question.

01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.940
But was Space Marine 2 a trending on Warhammer?

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.580
Have you thought of doing Warhammer 40k in general?

01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:05.020
So I did fermentide.

01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:06.940
I've seen some gameplay of Space Marine 2.

01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:09.260
I'll need to watch other people play it more

01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.340
but I think we will do it together

01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:13.100
if it's a stream snipe game.

01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.020
If Space Marine I can get you in stream snipe.

01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:17.340
I would like to play it with you for the first time.

01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:18.220
I think it would be nice.

01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.100
Um yeah.

01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:22.700
This is now a feet stream.

01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:24.540
You want me to talk with my feet?

01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:28.140
So I think we can play Space Marine 2 together

01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:30.620
but it has to be a stream snipe.

01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:32.780
Will fermentide come back?

01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.260
I think so but much later on.

01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:38.620
Every syllable I hit my feet okay.

01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:39.980
Hello.

01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:41.340
Any good cards today?

01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.780
Uh so yeah let me show you.

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.660
Hold on.

01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:44.220
Hold on.

01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:44.620
Wait.

01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.860
Uh we got...

01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:50.860
Hold on.

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:52.540
I'll see if I can show you the real ones real quick.

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:53.740
I know I'm further away from the mic.

01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:54.300
Forgive me.

01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:58.780
Uh kind of had a little shiny guy there.

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.620
We got guard devour shiny.

01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:01.180
Are you ready?

01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:03.180
The most important card.

01:58:03.180 --> 01:58:06.700
The Bokuwara SEX.

01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:09.020
SEX.

01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:11.020
SEX.

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:13.020
SEX.

01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:13.820
SEX.

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:17.100
Unfortunately very empty deck but we got Noibat.

01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:18.300
Uh Noivern.

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:19.260
Noibat lane.

01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:20.380
Very happy with that so.

01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:23.500
Um it's not the best.

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:27.500
We did get a very spanking rare like all the way back here.

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:28.060
Where is it?

01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:32.380
We got a rare thing that's supposed to be a tentacrow

01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.020
but they changed that.

01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:34.220
I don't know what they did.

01:58:34.220 --> 01:58:35.660
Bokuwara SEX.

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:37.420
And we got a rare pool on him.

01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:38.860
A little wiggly worm boy.

01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:41.260
And then our last pool was Neruso.

01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:44.140
Oh no of course not.

01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:45.580
Neruso's his youtuber that I watched.

01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:49.820
Her name is Nemono.

01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:51.340
Not Neruso.

01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.020
Um.

01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:06.060
Hello mom I just wanted to say that you're doing a good job.

01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:07.180
You stop that.

01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:08.460
I'm not giving brain worms.

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.180
Thank you.

01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:09.740
I try.

01:59:10.460 --> 01:59:11.340
Don't worry about it.

01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:14.140
Some will just get brain worms and it's inevitable bubble.

01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:15.820
But you're still doing a very good job.

01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:17.500
Keeping them at bay.

01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:20.060
Also interacting with you is not always good.

01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:22.060
Imagine getting 48 days of no income.

01:59:22.060 --> 01:59:23.580
No I didn't understand that.

01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:24.700
It was a misinput.

01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:27.420
A jail bird spot.

01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:28.300
I just like Neruso.

01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:29.740
I like her big fat titties.

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:30.860
Deep cups with X.

01:59:30.860 --> 01:59:32.620
Oh wait she doesn't want us to say that anymore.

01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:33.580
Oh.

01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:35.580
I never said that.

01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:37.420
Strony is short for stronethin.

01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:41.260
Sadly I'm not smart enough to do something clever with cuttles.

01:59:41.260 --> 01:59:43.260
So it doesn't beat Jimmy B soup.

01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:46.380
I'm called stronethin.

01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:47.660
Is that my legal name?

01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:47.980
Fuck.

01:59:48.540 --> 01:59:49.740
Stronethin?

01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:50.060
Shit.

01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:52.780
Can we take the socks off?

01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:54.780
Reeflin!

01:59:56.460 --> 01:59:56.780
No.

01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:58.220
That comes late.

01:59:59.180 --> 02:00:00.540
But I'll still talk through my feet though.

02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:02.380
Hi strony.

02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:05.020
I still have time on my no ink in your legs and thighs.

02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:06.540
You're making it hard to get right.

02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:09.100
Oh I just need stretch.

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:10.380
Oh look at the shape of that.

02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:11.660
Look at the calf muscle shape.

02:00:11.660 --> 02:00:12.780
Can you tell I ride a bike?

02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:15.260
Can you tell I got some stamina?

02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:16.300
What did Neruso say?

02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:17.580
I could have sworn Neruso was like

02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.100
I've had enough of yous being like I have big...

02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.220
Can you tell I ride a bike yes or no?

02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:22.860
Be honest.

02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:24.380
Can you tell?

02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:27.020
Do I ride a bike yes or no?

02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:28.480
No.

02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:33.340
Pray please it's my birthday?

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:33.820
No.

02:00:35.180 --> 02:00:37.180
I hope that bike isn't the only thing you ride.

02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:39.660
Well I did say I'm re-sexual so...

02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:43.340
And...

02:00:44.460 --> 02:00:46.780
How long does it take for you to train your back door?

02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:53.340
That's for another stream.

02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:58.140
Okay.

02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:00.060
Did we all enjoy the wholesome Pokemon time?

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.420
Sorry I just dropped the ball over here.

02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:04.860
The idle foot cam is killing me with my boot bit.

02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:05.820
Your foot interests.

02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:06.540
They are so cute.

02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.180
Please let me...

02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:09.100
You like my feet?

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:13.260
Would you like them even more if they were oiled up?

02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:19.500
Is there anyone here that's into CBT?

02:01:19.500 --> 02:01:20.460
Be honest.

02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:22.780
I too enjoy cognitive behavioral therapy.

02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:25.180
It is great for helping your health and overall thoughts.

02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:29.820
I wish I had something square...

02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:30.540
I did!

02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:32.620
Oh my god.

02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:36.700
I was like, I wish I had something especially I could stand on.

02:01:42.300 --> 02:01:42.620
There.

02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:45.500
Can I slip on this?

02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:47.820
Holy crap this is like so slippery.

02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:52.780
There stop it you're being denied.

02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:57.260
Have you seen that video where she's like doing this?

02:01:57.820 --> 02:01:58.940
To the guys?

02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:00.140
For no particular reason.

02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:01.500
Oh, playing a bit fit.

02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:02.380
Bit fit.

02:02:02.380 --> 02:02:03.500
Oh yeah the Celtics on!

02:02:03.500 --> 02:02:04.140
Celtics on!

02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:04.780
Everyone shut up!

02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.420
Celtics playing!

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:07.340
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:02:09.340 --> 02:02:15.260
Don't know if it's possible but putting the missing OW2 stream on Bansley would be a good solution.

02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:15.500
Probably.

02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:20.220
Seeing what happened in the stream I think the reeflings who missed it would greatly appreciate it.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.260
Yes, I can do that.

02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:24.380
Just not yet because I'm not ready for it yet.

02:02:24.380 --> 02:02:25.420
Oh, oh, Celtics on!

02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:25.980
Celtics on!

02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:26.460
She shoots!

02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:27.740
Oh, she scores!

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:28.540
Let's go.

02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:29.020
Let's go.

02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:30.140
I lost.

02:02:31.340 --> 02:02:33.260
Unfortunately I know where she's talking about!

02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:33.820
I win!

02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:35.740
Don't slip.

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:37.340
Oh, don't slip the slide.

02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:37.980
Can't read it.

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:40.700
Oh, so this is the Pokemon stream.

02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:43.900
Let's just put some cards in the viewpoint at least, you know.

02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:44.300
There.

02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:45.820
Now it's a real Pokemon stream.

02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:47.980
Hi cuddles!

02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:50.540
I'm much bigger and stronger than you but the thought of you dominant.

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.140
Oh, can I read these?

02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:54.620
I don't think I can read these.

02:02:57.340 --> 02:02:57.820
Ahem.

02:03:04.860 --> 02:03:05.660
Do you want to float?

02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:09.420
Love it.

02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:10.300
Love it too, though.

02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:14.460
What about the one with the guy in the floorboard?

02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:15.500
Yeah, that was the one.

02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:18.780
I was at Azura put it in the discord?

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:21.980
Like Azura randomly put it in the discord.

02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:26.780
And she thought it was fake.

02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:28.300
And it was like, no Azura.

02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:30.860
This is real cognitive behavioral therapy.

02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:33.900
And all of us were like, what is this?

02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:36.140
And we all watched it and it was the guy like, oh!

02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:41.740
And it was like, Azura, what do you mean you thought it was fake?

02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:43.340
You can see it getting redder.

02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:46.220
That was very much not fake, no.

02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:48.060
Yeah, yeah.

02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:52.460
It's thank you Nihongo or Nides for the tip.

02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:00.060
But yes, the diamond diamond.

02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.060
Some Pokemon card opened and this was off.

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.700
Are you enjoying the card?

02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:09.580
Hopefully.

02:04:11.260 --> 02:04:12.540
What's the gen donation?

02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:14.780
Oh, I'm annoying you with Shibi tomorrow.

02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:16.780
Yeah, me and Shibi are going to be a drill.

02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:20.780
She's never played the portal to Azura into it.

02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:23.660
I don't, I think she just didn't think it was real.

02:04:23.660 --> 02:04:24.460
And she was like, oh.

02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:28.940
I have seen it smashed between two boards.

02:04:30.220 --> 02:04:32.300
Most horrific one I thought was a lady in heels

02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:34.620
where she actually gives them a pure, oh fuck that man.

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:39.100
I think the worst thing I ever saw was like a flattening device.

02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:43.580
But it was flattened to like, I'm not even like an eighth of an inch.

02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:45.020
It was flattened.

02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:47.420
Like, I wasn't saying.

02:04:48.940 --> 02:04:50.940
A feet cam featuring some Pokemon cards.

02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:51.580
Oh yeah, sorry.

02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:53.340
I'm to talk via my feet.

02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:54.220
Hello, Reefling.

02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:00.140
Flattening device?

02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:01.580
Yeah, please stop.

02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:04.220
Well, I'm helping you if you're in the denial.

02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:06.060
I'm actually throwing you a bone.

02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:12.940
A CBT is also your special interest?

02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:14.140
No!

02:05:14.140 --> 02:05:15.900
Oh dear, poor Reefling.

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.060
Hi, Strony.

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:20.380
This has been the longest 48 hours of my life.

02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:20.700
Well.

02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:25.340
Flattening device?

02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:26.540
More like Strony's cake.

02:05:26.540 --> 02:05:27.500
Oh yeah, you wanna see that too?

02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:29.180
Kidding!

02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:29.900
You saw.

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:30.460
You saw.

02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:33.820
This is bad as the time as Narissa mentioned

02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:35.580
giving a guy a paper cut and taking his...

02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:38.380
What story did she tell us?

02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:40.940
Your hands are funny looking.

02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:42.300
I know they're claws.

02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:44.220
I got fake nails on.

02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:46.220
Let me see them.

02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:48.700
Little fake nails.

02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:49.900
Where the fuck is the webcam?

02:05:49.900 --> 02:05:50.780
Easy, I can't find them.

02:05:51.660 --> 02:05:53.500
Yeah, what an interesting design.

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:56.220
Middle finger and thumb only on the purple?

02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:58.140
This is supposed to be purple.

02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:00.060
It looked purple in the shop.

02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:01.580
And then I walked outside and it's blue

02:06:01.580 --> 02:06:02.300
and I'm like, I assure you,

02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:04.140
we do not have a fucking Celtic and Rangers

02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.260
bloody YouTuber model.

02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:07.740
Look, me getting a bit political

02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:09.420
around these parts, aren't we?

02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:10.780
What, me?

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:13.020
Close beta testing.

02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:13.420
Yes.

02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:16.860
The Card Shop Simulator game

02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:17.980
released full version,

02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:19.020
which I really wanna play.

02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:25.420
Sorry, I'm getting a lot of good feedback on my legs

02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:27.660
when I'm stretching and things like this.

02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.340
This feels really nice.

02:06:29.340 --> 02:06:31.580
As I said, I always have my toes

02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:33.740
pushed in against something.

02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:37.980
If you can't handle strontia or stumpies,

02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:40.300
you don't deserve her at her suppies.

02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.180
Is your kitty around?

02:06:43.180 --> 02:06:44.380
I don't think so.

02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:45.500
Hold on, I can go ask.

02:06:46.780 --> 02:06:48.220
I'll go ask Camely.

02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:52.140
Camely, are you there, Camely?

02:06:53.900 --> 02:06:56.140
Camely, where'd you go?

02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:01.500
Are you coming?

02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:04.860
I don't know if you can see her.

02:07:05.740 --> 02:07:06.140
Come.

02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:07.340
Come on.

02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:08.380
I heard there's a...

02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:10.380
Come on.

02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:12.300
Vigo doesn't like this one,

02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:13.980
so I'm not gonna even ask him.

02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:14.940
Get away.

02:07:16.380 --> 02:07:17.900
Come explore the Pokémon.

02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:21.180
Where are you going, Vigo?

02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:23.180
She's...

02:07:23.180 --> 02:07:25.660
She's no longer in this race.

02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:27.180
She's a spirit.

02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:28.140
She's a spirit.

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:29.100
She's a spirit.

02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:30.060
She's a spirit.

02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.020
She's a spirit.

02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:31.900
She's a spirit.

02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:32.940
She's a spirit.

02:07:32.940 --> 02:07:33.740
She's a spirit.

02:07:33.740 --> 02:07:34.460
She's a spirit.

02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:35.340
She's a spirit.

02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:37.420
I just need her to jump there.

02:07:37.420 --> 02:07:38.460
She's a spirit.

02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:40.540
I'm scared here.

02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:43.180
Because normally I'm super quiet,

02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:44.780
and then I get all nice and loud with you.

02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:46.380
Who do you mean?

02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:48.700
Camely's gonna chew on the corn.

02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:53.260
Give him my things.

02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:54.140
She didn't hate me.

02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:54.540
She just...

02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:56.540
Because I'm very quiet.

02:07:57.420 --> 02:08:01.660
Like, I spoke on G mode with the girls this morning,

02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:05.820
and Vigo was meowing his head off

02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:07.260
as I was like, Vigo, Vigo, Vigo.

02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:12.220
A peacock girl.

02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:12.860
Interesting.

02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:14.140
No, this is not peacock.

02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:15.980
You can't guess from the colour scheme.

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:17.740
It's supposed to be purple and green.

02:08:19.580 --> 02:08:21.180
You cannot guess what this type of girl

02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:22.380
would be from the nails alone.

02:08:23.660 --> 02:08:24.780
It is not possible,

02:08:24.780 --> 02:08:25.900
but no, she's not peacock.

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:26.780
It is purple.

02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:27.900
It's supposed to be purple,

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.180
but that's very blue on screen.

02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:31.100
Hospital socks again?

02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:33.020
When am I never out of them?

02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:34.780
Hmm?

02:08:34.780 --> 02:08:36.380
Have you ever seen me out of hospital socks?

02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:37.980
I'm actually in the hospital right now,

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:39.580
and they just let me do what I please.

02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:45.020
I give them no grief when I get to hang out with the refunds,

02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:46.380
and I get to do what I want.

02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:47.340
I get no grief,

02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:49.420
so they let me have a little pee pee

02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:50.620
in my little stream once.

02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:52.380
Feet nails?

02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:53.100
Nails.

02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:53.420
Hmm.

02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:57.820
There's a pee in.

02:08:57.820 --> 02:08:58.780
There's a pee in.

02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:00.540
Oh, there.

02:09:00.540 --> 02:09:02.300
Mummy's in the hospital?

02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:03.260
Yeah.

02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:04.860
All right, I got to go get some dinner.

02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:05.580
Rest well.

02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:06.620
Thank you for hanging.

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:10.380
And I...

02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:12.140
I'm actually going to redirect into emergency.

02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:13.820
This is a much shorter stream today.

02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:14.780
Down badling?

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:15.660
You can say.

02:09:15.660 --> 02:09:16.620
Noodle arms.

02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:17.100
Uh-huh.

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.460
Humongous cake.

02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:18.780
Yes.

02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:22.220
And some nice-looking athletic legs.

02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:23.020
Uh-huh.

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:24.060
So looking good.

02:09:24.060 --> 02:09:25.260
Oh, you want to taste?

02:09:26.220 --> 02:09:28.300
You want to taste of this cuttlefish?

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:30.060
You like calamari?

02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:30.780
Caramari?

02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:36.380
Thank you, down badling, for the tip that you have.

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:40.460
Be proven from the psych ward, actually, though,

02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:42.220
for real, for real, could you imagine?

02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:43.580
I could pull that off.

02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:44.460
Don't think I couldn't.

02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:47.500
All you need to do is a bit of bribery.

02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:48.780
Imagine, like, I'll be like,

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.220
look, let me get my nails done.

02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:53.260
I'll give you a one-hour ASMR session through your heads.

02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:55.820
Like, I'll give you the, like, headpats for one hour.

02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:56.300
Boom.

02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:56.620
Right.

02:09:56.620 --> 02:09:56.940
There.

02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:57.740
I got the stuff.

02:09:57.740 --> 02:09:58.940
I got my nails done.

02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.380
Okay, next thing I need.

02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:04.380
I need materials and supplies and PC and monitor,

02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:05.020
and I need a room.

02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.500
So I'm actually in the staff room right now, okay?

02:10:07.500 --> 02:10:09.820
I'm in the staff room of the asylum.

02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:12.380
And they're just letting me be it

02:10:12.380 --> 02:10:14.380
because I'm not giving them any tip when I'm like this.

02:10:16.940 --> 02:10:17.900
Oh, God, Gira.

02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:20.380
Gira's back, back, back.

02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:22.140
Yeah, this is back, back, back.

02:10:22.220 --> 02:10:26.380
Yes, this is back, yes, this is back, yes, this is back.

02:10:26.380 --> 02:10:27.580
Do, do, do.

02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.420
Don't ask why she's in that pose.

02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:30.700
Don't ask.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:33.420
Thank you for the tip.

02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:33.900
Bam.

02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:36.700
I think I'm in black today.

02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:42.140
Yep.

02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:43.180
Black, if you see that.

02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:43.500
Yep.

02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:45.740
Why is she in that pose?

02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:46.460
No, I don't know.

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:47.100
Don't ask me.

02:10:47.900 --> 02:10:48.540
Don't ask me.

02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:49.820
I don't know.

02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:50.300
Hold on.

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:51.740
I'm just grabbing that.

02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:52.940
I need my bobbers.

02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:54.220
Right.

02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:55.340
I'm ready to wrap up.

02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:58.140
Is there anything I need to tell you?

02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.580
Are you squiddin' me right now?

02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:02.860
The face connect girls livin' a psych ward?

02:11:04.540 --> 02:11:05.040
Oh.

02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:07.820
I just forbidden lore.

02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:10.540
Oregon, thank you for the tip.

02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:12.860
Is this face connect lore that I don't know about?

02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:14.860
You guys need to teach me about other retours.

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:19.820
It's weird you're in black.

02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:21.580
I have absolutely terrible news.

02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:27.580
I have absolutely horrific news about what I look like day to day.

02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:33.180
I am a pale, pasty, pasty goth, okay?

02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:36.620
That puts no effort into her appearance.

02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:37.120
So.

02:11:40.620 --> 02:11:41.340
You can hear like, huh?

02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:48.700
I understand why people get parasocial over shimmers

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:50.540
after watching news, Ronnie.

02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:52.460
Okay, I relearned what parasocial meant.

02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:54.300
I thought parasocial meant you're coming to my house

02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.820
and it was like dangerous.

02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:57.500
But it's not dangerous.

02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:59.420
And as long as it's happy, then it's good.

02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:00.140
Like it's fine.

02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:02.540
So thank you, Ethan.

02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:04.700
For the nice comment.

02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:06.620
That is how it means, yes.

02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:08.700
You're too powerful.

02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:11.580
And she's ever not wearing black.

02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.340
I do have black rippy socks.

02:12:14.860 --> 02:12:15.580
Terrible news.

02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:18.060
Ronnie's in fact, demure and mindful.

02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:19.900
That's straight up a thought.

02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:21.740
That is technically parasocial in a way.

02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:25.020
I thought if it was unhealthy, then it's parasocial and bad.

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:27.100
But if it's like, fuck, I'm actually happy

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.940
and I'm enjoying watching like shit.

02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:29.740
I thought that was good.

02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.540
Like, fuck me.

02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:32.540
Fuck me.

02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:35.660
Like let's jump into a match of fucking left for dead too.

02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:37.420
We're going to finish the campaign together.

02:12:38.460 --> 02:12:39.500
Am I going mental?

02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:41.180
I think I might misunderstand.

02:12:41.180 --> 02:12:44.300
Cause like, which is more grippy?

02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:46.300
Ronnie socks or her actual bear grippers?

02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:47.900
Oh no, I can go rip.

02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:49.740
I have toes that fucking grip.

02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:51.900
I assure you, I just can't do it with salt on, okay?

02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:53.180
Trust me, bro.

02:12:53.180 --> 02:12:54.300
I'll do it in another stream, okay?

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:59.660
Can get bad, but mainly just get social very vicariously.

02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:00.620
Oh, that's a big word.

02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:02.140
That's a big word for Elmo.

02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:05.980
It depends how far gone mentally the person is.

02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:08.780
I thought it was just like, you're nice to each other and shit.

02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:10.700
Like you say, I love you, mummy.

02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:12.220
And I say, I love you, reflin.

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:14.060
And it's like, Ken what?

02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:16.220
If you don't fucking hear it, if, you know,

02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:17.900
if you don't have got someone in your life that says,

02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:18.300
Ken what?

02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:19.580
I fucking love you.

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:20.620
Flaws and all.

02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:23.180
Well, fucking excuse me for being the one to do it.

02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:25.500
Like you do deserve to be told that you're loved

02:13:25.500 --> 02:13:29.420
and you do deserve to be told that, like, yeah.

02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:32.460
If we judged each other for like our worst fucking days,

02:13:32.460 --> 02:13:34.300
would any of us fucking be here?

02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:35.740
No, cause when you've had a bad day,

02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:37.180
you've had a fucking dry day.

02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:37.820
Ken, what I mean?

02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:38.780
Or am I misunderstood?

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:39.660
I think I'm misunderstood.

02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:40.060
I don't know.

02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:42.700
Power socials character, great teenage girl,

02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:44.140
loves actor, good power socials.

02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:45.420
Ronnie and the reflins, good.

02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:47.500
Reflins to Ronnie, good, stop or bad.

02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:48.300
Right, okay.

02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:48.700
Yeah.

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:49.500
Oh, how cute.

02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:50.540
She's delusional.

02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:52.300
Am I in the silence?

02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:54.060
People can take it too seriously and go too far.

02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:55.340
I love everything about you, Shen.

02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:56.380
It's a spectrum.

02:13:56.380 --> 02:13:57.900
What a good thing I'm an autist then.

02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:00.220
I've mastered this part.

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:02.860
They are both good and bad.

02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:05.180
Some people just take it too far and it's a bad thing.

02:14:05.180 --> 02:14:05.900
I love her so much.

02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:07.020
I love two people.

02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:08.380
This right here.

02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:09.580
I agree with this one.

02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:14.140
Yeah, I just like, am I good mental?

02:14:14.140 --> 02:14:15.180
I feel like if it was like,

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:16.940
I'm not playing games with you on stream.

02:14:16.940 --> 02:14:18.060
I'm not saying I love you.

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:19.580
I'm not saying da, da, da, da.

02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:21.980
I was like, why would you want to put your stonks

02:14:21.980 --> 02:14:24.220
into a strummer like that anyway?

02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:28.700
Isn't it not fucking nice to be told you're appreciated

02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:29.420
and you're loved?

02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:31.100
And yeah, you might be a lurker.

02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:31.900
You might only talk.

02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:33.820
You might only be able to catch me in the boards.

02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:37.900
I am still appreciative of your time that you put into me

02:14:37.900 --> 02:14:40.780
because you, I'll say it again.

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:42.940
I'll say it again.

02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:46.700
You could literally be consuming any other content creator

02:14:46.700 --> 02:14:48.540
right at this very second.

02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:50.140
And yet you chose me.

02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:54.140
The watermelon-haired hypnotic cuttlefish

02:14:54.140 --> 02:14:56.860
that's done two hypnosis streams and called it a day.

02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:00.460
Like, I don't know how to, I don't know how to tell you.

02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:01.660
Oregon, thank you for the tip.

02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:06.460
And Hydrus Simothadius.

02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:08.380
Fucking good luck saying that right.

02:15:08.380 --> 02:15:09.740
Thank you for becoming a member.

02:15:09.740 --> 02:15:11.420
Please enjoy your moments.

02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:12.540
I love your ASMR.

02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:16.220
Well, you're going to be in for a treat tomorrow.

02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:16.780
Oh, sure.

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:17.260
Yes.

02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:18.780
And I wouldn't choose any other.

02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:21.500
Thank you, my man.

02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:24.380
Why are you called that?

02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:26.620
You've got an interesting gamertag.

02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:29.020
And birth an amazing gen.

02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:30.460
Sounds really appealing to me.

02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:32.780
Literally, like, do you want to make sure you're happy?

02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:35.420
If you're streaming and you're happy

02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:36.620
and you know what, clap your hands.

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:38.060
Hey, oh.

02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:48.220
If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:59.020
You could see the thought forming in my mind.

02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:04.700
You could see it forming in my mind

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:08.140
when the words came out and I did the fucking thing.

02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:11.260
You could see it.

02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:12.380
I'm going to sit on my chair.

02:16:12.380 --> 02:16:13.420
I'm going to sit on my chair.

02:16:14.700 --> 02:16:16.140
I'm going to sit on my little game of chair.

02:16:16.140 --> 02:16:16.780
Oh, no.

02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:17.500
You can see the wheel.

02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:17.820
Oh, my God.

02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:18.380
How embarrassing.

02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:19.740
You can see the wheel of my game of chair.

02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:21.260
There.

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:22.460
Pokemon's from by the way.

02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:24.940
We could see your hands in the shadow.

02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:29.660
I love you, Strani, because you just seem cool.

02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:30.460
Also, clap, clap.

02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:36.460
Like, as you see, like, you're here to have a good time.

02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:38.700
I'm here to have a good time.

02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:41.180
We can play video together and stuff like that.

02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:43.820
Parasocial can be that you really like the streamer

02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:46.460
as a friend and want to watch and help her on one end,

02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:49.260
but also can mean that you decide to find her

02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:50.860
and try to visit her or hurt her.

02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:51.740
Yeah, that's scary.

02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:53.420
The streamer is only yours.

02:16:53.980 --> 02:16:55.740
Depends on the mental from fan.

02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:58.780
Yeah, like, that part's scary.

02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:01.100
But the bit before where it's like,

02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:04.220
fuck yeah, hold my hand through fucking Subnautica.

02:17:04.220 --> 02:17:05.740
Like, oh, my God, I love that game.

02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:06.460
Can we play?

02:17:06.460 --> 02:17:07.980
I wish Subnautica was multiplayer.

02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:10.620
I'd go fucking mental if it was multiplayer.

02:17:11.260 --> 02:17:12.460
I'd be so brave.

02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:14.220
I wouldn't be screaming at the reapers

02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:15.260
or anything like that.

02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:16.940
Thank you.

02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:21.820
Bit of an educational link for the tit.

02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:23.820
Yeah, I see that's right.

02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:26.380
Personally, I'm happy to talk and flirt here.

02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:27.980
And all the other reflins are nice too.

02:17:27.980 --> 02:17:31.500
However, I don't think you have some deeper feelings for me,

02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:33.020
especially since you don't actually know me.

02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:34.620
Give me that dick.

02:17:34.620 --> 02:17:35.420
Now, let's find out.

02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:41.820
I'm trying so hard.

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:43.500
Had to become a member for the Great Vison.

02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:47.740
Do not be expecting feet membership streams.

02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:48.860
Oh, my gosh.

02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:51.740
I'm so sorry to disappoint you

02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:53.900
if you signed up for feet membership streams.

02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:03.660
I mean, I could do oiled up earcup and ASMR

02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:04.860
with my feet, I guess.

02:18:04.860 --> 02:18:12.460
Like, except only expect membership streams.

02:18:12.460 --> 02:18:15.980
Like, I don't know if you saw it.

02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:17.500
There was Goon Cave review.

02:18:22.780 --> 02:18:23.260
Aw.

02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:25.820
I'd love to take photos with Mama,

02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:27.660
even if you're a TV on a stick.

02:18:27.660 --> 02:18:28.380
A TV on a stick?

02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:29.900
I can even wear my Mama's sweater

02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:31.580
under score love, under score love.

02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:33.020
Oh, that's okay.

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:33.980
Thank you, basically.

02:18:33.980 --> 02:18:36.220
I've never been to a con either.

02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:37.500
You want me to zoom about.

02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:39.740
Can I run you over if I'm one of those robots?

02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:41.100
Can I run into you?

02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:44.060
I can give you a struggle, snuggle tackle

02:18:44.060 --> 02:18:45.260
if I'm in one of those robots

02:18:45.260 --> 02:18:47.820
and then I have to pay like $3,000 in damages

02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:48.780
to the equipment.

02:18:49.580 --> 02:18:52.540
Strongly takes your con chair at will.

02:18:55.340 --> 02:18:56.380
It's been done before.

02:18:56.380 --> 02:18:58.380
You can run into us, but you might fall afar.

02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:00.780
To be honest, just the yapping stream

02:19:00.780 --> 02:19:02.860
of feet in the background would be nice to.

02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:05.420
I do love a good yapping, honestly.

02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:09.900
Are you do larger scale playing with viewers?

02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:11.180
What's in life or do you have an idea

02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:12.860
that the other ones can come in

02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:14.300
and play mountain blade banner?

02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:15.580
We might do SCP.

02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:20.940
I'm going to see if we can do SCP maybe for my birthday.

02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:21.980
No, I'm just making memes.

02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:22.620
Sorry, my bad.

02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:23.340
No, you're fine.

02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:24.220
Don't apologize.

02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:25.260
See, yeah, brainworm.

02:19:25.260 --> 02:19:27.180
Don't let the brainworms win.

02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:28.940
I just don't know how to say your name properly.

02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.420
Thank you for the tip.

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.500
Solve a Rubik's cube with your feet real.

02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:47.100
I might try that.

02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:51.500
Dangerous parasociality is pretty much never a creator's fault.

02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:54.940
Let's not forget poor Björk had a literal insane stalker

02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:58.460
in the 90s and she never read his Dono's or Erotic Malo's.

02:19:58.460 --> 02:19:59.020
Oh!

02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:01.500
Healthy fans know how to love some respects

02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:02.700
with their friends' length.

02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:05.900
Oregon, thank you for the tip.

02:20:05.900 --> 02:20:06.220
Okay.

02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:12.060
And she never read his Dono's or his Erotic Marsh Malo's.

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:13.900
Hi, Stronny.

02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:17.580
I want to run my tongue up your legs and thigh until I've missed.

02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:19.980
I memorized what your legs and thighs feel like.

02:20:23.020 --> 02:20:23.660
Right.

02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:27.180
Mount and Blade Bannerlord and have both fan bases fight each other

02:20:27.180 --> 02:20:28.780
in the battlefield through their Oshii.

02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:38.780
Honestly, is that that game where the guy was like Tally Ho and he died

02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:42.140
and they have to like cock their guns?

02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:46.860
Like they have to like shove the barrel up and down it

02:20:46.860 --> 02:20:47.740
and then reload it?

02:20:47.740 --> 02:20:48.620
Like that old game?

02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:53.980
Bannerlord is pretty hard though.

02:20:53.980 --> 02:20:54.220
Yeah.

02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:56.620
You're on about him.

02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:57.740
I think he can.

02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:01.420
There's another game that's like, it's a multiplayer game

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:03.980
and there was like a really funny clip and he was like,

02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:05.740
I'm going to make it and he dies instantly.

02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:07.260
You might be thinking of hold fast.

02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:10.780
It's a medieval war game.

02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:18.700
Role blocks, rust, factorial, Minecraft?

02:21:23.500 --> 02:21:24.060
I don't know.

02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:26.300
I don't know what I want to do for my Donathon.

02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:30.620
I really like doing the collab on the Donathon.

02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:35.980
I thought it would be possible to maybe do crab game stream snipe.

02:21:39.260 --> 02:21:40.860
I thought that would be fun.

02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:42.940
Not all the girls have to stream it if they don't want to,

02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:44.700
but I would like them to be there

02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:48.300
and then you guys literally have the opportunity to stream snipe

02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:49.820
like me and my gen mates.

02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:52.540
Not just me, like all six of us are going to be in it.

02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:56.620
Bannerlord is with the boobs.

02:21:56.620 --> 02:21:57.020
Okay.

02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:00.380
Yeah, I don't know.

02:22:00.380 --> 02:22:01.740
Crab game is a bit meh,

02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:05.820
but you guys would like genuinely make it much more interesting.

02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:08.460
So I'm going to see if maybe crab game

02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:09.740
will be the stream snipe one.

02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:15.980
Factorial can have 65,000 people on a server at once.

02:22:16.940 --> 02:22:17.260
How?

02:22:19.820 --> 02:22:20.140
How?

02:22:21.740 --> 02:22:22.860
Who coded that?

02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:27.660
That man needs some under the table support.

02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:30.460
65,000 people on a server at once.

02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:32.140
How is this possible?

02:22:33.580 --> 02:22:34.540
What is crab game?

02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:37.740
Crab game is a free to play multiplayer game

02:22:37.740 --> 02:22:41.900
based on the squid games.

02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:44.300
It was me.

02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:45.020
Oh, okay.

02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:49.820
Yeah, it is possible through even on Australian ping.

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:53.340
Would I be the server host?

02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:54.700
Your PC will not survive.

02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:01.260
The SEC secret lab will be in person.

02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:03.820
Splatoon, I'm afraid I've not bought the game.

02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:05.820
Apparently it's actually bad for stream sniping.

02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:06.620
Sorry, can't see feet.

02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:20.220
Very big game not visually demanding in special circumstances.

02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:21.740
Crab game would be hilarious.

02:23:21.740 --> 02:23:24.780
Factory dev is addicted to optimization, clearly.

02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:26.780
Is SAP free?

02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:27.580
I think so.

02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:29.340
SAP multiplayer?

02:23:30.140 --> 02:23:32.700
Oh wait, would it be free if it's got servers they have to run?

02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:36.860
Wait a minute, that makes no sense.

02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:41.340
Right.

02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:42.380
Are you squiddin' me right now?

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:43.820
I don't know, are you squiddin' me right now?

02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:46.940
Parasocial is basically one-sided relationship.

02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:47.420
Uh-huh.

02:23:47.420 --> 02:23:50.860
It becomes dangerous when you become too emotionally dependent

02:23:50.860 --> 02:23:54.700
and begin thinking the one you want is your special one only.

02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:57.820
But then it becomes worse than parasocial.

02:23:57.820 --> 02:24:00.300
Basically a negative three tiers above.

02:24:01.500 --> 02:24:02.140
What does that mean?

02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:04.460
Thank you anonymous for the tip.

02:24:04.460 --> 02:24:10.140
So yeah, that's where I'm worried.

02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:12.060
That's why I'm always like make sure you're having fun

02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:13.820
because you know when you're not having fun anymore?

02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:15.900
That's when I'm like you're not enjoying yourself.

02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:18.700
Like you're just hurting yourself and I don't want you to hurt yourself.

02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:21.260
Like I want it to be good fun.

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:24.620
I want it to just be like me mucking about opening up Pokémon cards.

02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:26.060
I have no idea how to pull.

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:30.140
Yeah, that kind of thing.

02:24:30.140 --> 02:24:33.100
Lamar, she puts her feet on cam like jingle and keys.

02:24:33.100 --> 02:24:34.140
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:36.460
Gonna redirect into mercy in five hours.

02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:38.060
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:39.420
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:42.540
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:43.900
Five hours.

02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:45.500
Five hours.

02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:46.620
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

02:24:47.340 --> 02:24:48.460
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:55.900
But yeah, if you guys are okay, I'm gonna wrap it up.

02:24:56.300 --> 02:25:03.180
Um, can we, uh, we can.

02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:04.860
Five hour Yapathon, honestly.

02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:08.460
Don't be silly and subject your willy to what you don't like.

02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:10.060
The wise words are strony calls.

02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:10.780
Absolutely true.

02:25:10.780 --> 02:25:11.900
Redirect in five hours.

02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:13.100
More like five hours a stream.

02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:17.500
No, I need to go off because I'm gonna try and get the ASMR video off.

02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:19.260
I'm gonna update my Patreon as well.

02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:25.820
I don't know if I can do the caller for all and dog Zemma.

02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:31.900
Not to be confused with X-Zema, the spin condition, or Yima, X-Zema.

02:25:33.180 --> 02:25:34.780
This is a feet puppet show.

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:40.700
Okay, so this is an innocent little reefling here, and this is me hiding.

02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:48.620
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

02:25:48.620 --> 02:25:52.140
And the thing is, you can pretend to fight, but you're not gonna win, okay?

02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:52.780
I'm too strong.

02:25:57.740 --> 02:26:01.340
No reefling, accept it, accept it, reefling.

02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:07.100
Let it happen, reefletch, let it happen.

02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:11.820
And then boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.

02:26:13.660 --> 02:26:14.860
I'll show you the thunder side.

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:17.260
I fell down on my pants so long.

02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:19.260
Who would ask to go?

02:26:21.500 --> 02:26:23.420
A real reefling would never fight back.

02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:25.180
The struggle.

02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:28.940
Can you rotate strongly like a shark?

02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:30.460
I can't show my bottom half.

02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:31.260
It's not allowed.

02:26:32.220 --> 02:26:33.820
Don't stop when I pass out.

02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:34.620
Oh my god!

02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:40.060
Prailing.

02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:43.580
Aww.

02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:45.420
Love you, mama.

02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:46.300
Love you, mommy.

02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:47.500
Love you too, reefling.

02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:49.340
Thank you, Prailing, for the tip.

02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:49.740
Yay.

02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:53.820
I'm asked to come someday.

02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:55.260
So can't stream as mommy works.

02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:58.940
Do you want that for the membership writing stream?

02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:03.900
I could do the membership writing streaming.

02:27:03.900 --> 02:27:06.540
It's just a fucking video feed on my feet.

02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:07.500
If you want.

02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:09.340
I mean, shit, I'm not here to dictate.

02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:10.620
Do what you want.

02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:15.100
You're allowed to ask for the content you want to see around these parts.

02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:17.260
I'm not going to be like, ah, don't backseat game me.

02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:18.780
Ah, don't tell me I want to stream.

02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:21.580
No, I'm fine with it.

02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:22.860
I know, I'm being attacked.

02:27:22.860 --> 02:27:23.500
Help.

02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:23.980
I guess.

02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:28.060
I love mommy because she gave me a place to belong.

02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:29.340
Oh, that's so sweet.

02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:35.980
Strongly Bottom is a WDM weapon of math.

02:27:36.540 --> 02:27:38.940
They're bad, Sean.

02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:40.860
My lawyer has advised me to end the drip game.

02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:45.180
Now, unlike you, a shark, you immobilize strongy with

02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:48.220
wrapping her in a soft blanket and giving her a head pass, and please.

02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:49.660
Oh, you put me a bed.

02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:52.380
Are you going to fuck me in?

02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:56.460
You can't just tuck me in.

02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:00.140
You have to do the other part too, or it doesn't count.

02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:03.660
I'm not into feet.

02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:05.180
Do what you're comfortable with.

02:28:05.180 --> 02:28:08.940
You're like, oh, please wrap up the fucking feet, strongy.

02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:10.220
Jesus, we get it.

02:28:10.220 --> 02:28:11.660
You're wearing grippy socks, woman.

02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:14.620
Please wrap it up.

02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:15.900
I do love good wrap-ups.

02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:18.700
I'm going to want you in.

02:28:19.900 --> 02:28:20.780
Boko wa ya.

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:25.260
Right, I'll check Marshmallow one more time just to make sure.

02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:26.380
Mommy, you're so cute.

02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:28.620
Yeah, do you like how I get all excited when I get to do it

02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:30.220
and really things, be anything?

02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:31.900
Look at that toe spread.

02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:32.780
Oh, my God.

02:28:32.780 --> 02:28:33.900
Look at that pinky toe.

02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:34.700
Yeah, damn.

02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:36.300
Looks like I've webbed feet under those.

02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:38.460
I promise you these toes separate.

02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:41.660
Yeah, well, Mae, you're so cute today.

02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:42.540
Thank you.

02:28:42.540 --> 02:28:43.660
Hi, strongy.

02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:45.260
I just wanted to say this real quick.

02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:46.780
Thank you for your Twitter content.

02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:47.820
It is freaking amazing.

02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:49.420
I don't know why you sound like Elvis.

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:51.180
Thank you for all the fun streams and everything.

02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:51.660
I love you.

02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:53.740
I love you too.

02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:54.940
I love you too.

02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:55.820
I love you too.

02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:56.380
Oh, yeah.

02:28:58.220 --> 02:29:00.940
I don't know why you turned into Elvis there, but you did, okay?

02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:02.380
You did.

02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:04.380
Hi, strongy.

02:29:04.380 --> 02:29:05.500
Hi, mithan.

02:29:05.500 --> 02:29:07.660
I love you with every fiber of my being.

02:29:07.660 --> 02:29:10.140
You have quickly became my kami-oshi.

02:29:10.140 --> 02:29:10.860
Oh, no.

02:29:10.860 --> 02:29:14.060
I feel so nervous when you call me kami-oshi.

02:29:14.860 --> 02:29:17.660
I'm like, aren't you disappointed in me?

02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:21.340
I was like, could you not pick a little bit better?

02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:25.580
You're the most wonderful person I've ever known.

02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:27.420
You make us all feel loved and appreciated.

02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:29.740
You generally make my day better just with your yapping.

02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:31.500
Yeah, you're like when I do feet puppetin.

02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:32.540
Yeah.

02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:36.860
I'm proud to be your riefling and call you my kami-oshi.

02:29:36.860 --> 02:29:39.100
I will always love you and be here to support you.

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:40.220
Oh, thank you, riefling.

02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:41.100
I love you too.

02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:42.140
That's so sweet.

02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:45.820
Nice screen to open up streams to.

02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:47.020
Yeah, I wouldn't do it very.

02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:48.380
I would close this.

02:29:48.380 --> 02:29:49.260
The stream's over.

02:29:51.020 --> 02:29:53.900
Let me put my feet on your mouth to silence you.

02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:55.820
It's okay.

02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:56.780
Just let it happen.

02:29:57.420 --> 02:29:58.380
Just let it happen.

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:02.220
Oh, yeah.

02:30:02.220 --> 02:30:05.420
There's one more hand cream stream at the end of this week.

02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:08.220
And then I believe that's all my hand cam for quite a while.

02:30:11.980 --> 02:30:13.100
Let me check my schedule.

02:30:13.100 --> 02:30:14.780
I'll let you have my schedule open right now.

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:18.620
I'll put 25 Tenga celebration.

02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:19.660
Soft clay form.

02:30:19.660 --> 02:30:20.940
So that's hand cam.

02:30:20.940 --> 02:30:22.300
And then it's dragon quest.

02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:23.260
Conquer is bad for a day.

02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:25.420
That's getting delayed for something else.

02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:31.340
I've got a deep rock galactica stream snipe next week.

02:30:32.140 --> 02:30:33.340
Like the next next week.

02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:36.220
Star Wars Battlefront campaign's coming up.

02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:37.500
ASMR stream's coming up.

02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:40.700
Let me snuggle up to you, ASMR stream.

02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:42.220
See how it goes.

02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:43.180
Rock and stone.

02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:48.460
That moment when the Bluetooth connects in the car.

02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:51.820
You can see what the positive messages do to mama.

02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:54.700
Close her toes go wild and erratic.

02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:56.860
Yeah, we can see to the adorable mama.

02:30:56.860 --> 02:30:59.260
Wait, my toes reacted to your messages?

02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:00.300
Stop.

02:31:00.300 --> 02:31:01.580
Did they actually?

02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:01.980
Hold on.

02:31:01.980 --> 02:31:03.580
I'm going to get that shit off the screen.

02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:05.740
Did my toes react to your messages?

02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:09.020
I'm having pepega.

02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:10.140
Thank you, Pete Kling.

02:31:11.740 --> 02:31:13.020
No permission for conquer.

02:31:13.020 --> 02:31:15.020
No, no, just to delay it for something else.

02:31:15.980 --> 02:31:18.060
Did my fucking toes react?

02:31:18.060 --> 02:31:19.100
That's embarrassing.

02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:20.620
I'm putting them under the cover now.

02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:21.260
What?

02:31:21.260 --> 02:31:21.820
Oh my God.

02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:26.220
I was like, you got me feeling things and stuff.

02:31:28.300 --> 02:31:29.020
That's a fact.

02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:30.940
I don't know that.

02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:36.460
I've got Left 4 Dead Streamsnip campaign on the 4th of October.

02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:39.340
We'll go back to Left 4 Dead.

02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:41.740
I think Conker's Bad Friday's getting delayed

02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:45.740
and we'll try and wrap up Subnautica on that day.

02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:47.580
I'm just looking.

02:31:47.580 --> 02:31:49.900
I'm just straight up leaking the rest of my schedule.

02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:51.500
I've got an ASMR maid roleplay.

02:31:52.220 --> 02:31:53.260
Professor Layton.

02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:54.460
I've got High on Life.

02:31:54.460 --> 02:31:55.740
Never played that.

02:31:55.740 --> 02:31:58.540
I've got Baking My Genmates.

02:31:58.540 --> 02:31:59.980
It's coming up in October.

02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:01.340
That's probably the next handcam.

02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:04.140
But I'm calming it on the handcam for quite a while

02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:05.820
because I've had quite a few back-to-back ones.

02:32:07.580 --> 02:32:08.860
Not until I get new nails.

02:32:08.860 --> 02:32:09.340
Okay?

02:32:09.340 --> 02:32:10.140
I need new nails.

02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:10.940
Her feet timed.

02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:11.580
She covered them.

02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:12.460
Am I ruining that?

02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:13.100
I don't know.

02:32:13.100 --> 02:32:15.420
Are my fucking toes reacting to your messages?

02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:17.660
I'm like, oh my God.

02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:18.860
That's embarrassing.

02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:20.380
You can see me squirm.

02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:21.020
Great for me.

02:32:21.020 --> 02:32:24.780
I'm like, a fellow toe spreader?

02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:25.740
What have you sent?

02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:28.460
Are you sent a fucking video of your feet?

02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:31.820
Hold on.

02:32:31.820 --> 02:32:34.780
Have you just sent me a video of your feet in Marshmallow?

02:32:36.700 --> 02:32:37.100
All right.

02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:44.620
Ruflin, get your dogs off of my screen.

02:32:45.580 --> 02:32:46.380
That's hilarious.

02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:48.780
I'm like, why is your feet so veiny, though?

02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:51.020
Are you a runner?

02:32:52.860 --> 02:32:55.020
Why is your feet so pale at the knuckles,

02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:56.700
but then you have like blood flow out,

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:58.380
like your ankle and your toe area?

02:33:02.300 --> 02:33:03.900
You can't just ask someone that.

02:33:03.900 --> 02:33:05.100
Why are you white?

02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:06.780
That's funniest fuck.

02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:07.500
Thank you, Ruflin.

02:33:07.500 --> 02:33:08.300
That's hilarious.

02:33:08.300 --> 02:33:09.820
Thank you for showing me your grippers.

02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:15.980
It's a vampire vascular guy, I think so.

02:33:16.700 --> 02:33:20.220
In her reaction, hmm.

02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:20.700
Hi, mom.

02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:21.260
I love you.

02:33:21.260 --> 02:33:23.260
I can't wait to see what my technical comes.

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:24.380
Oh, okay.

02:33:24.380 --> 02:33:25.340
Love you too, Ruflin.

02:33:27.580 --> 02:33:29.020
Why are you white?

02:33:29.020 --> 02:33:29.580
Hi, Johnny.

02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:30.700
I just want to send this real quick.

02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:35.820
What other stuff?

02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:36.780
I'm playing control.

02:33:36.780 --> 02:33:38.620
Apparently it's SCP adjacent.

02:33:39.180 --> 02:33:43.020
Mines of Moria stream got delayed way at the end of October.

02:33:43.020 --> 02:33:46.300
And then I'm going to do a test crowd control stream,

02:33:46.300 --> 02:33:48.140
possibly, on Pokemon Emerald.

02:33:49.900 --> 02:33:51.340
I don't know how that works, though.

02:33:51.900 --> 02:33:54.220
I'm going to have to look into it.

02:33:54.220 --> 02:33:58.940
I've got God of War coming up in November.

02:33:58.940 --> 02:34:01.260
I've got BioShock Infinite in November.

02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:04.940
I've got Mario 64 in November.

02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:07.020
Johnny, do you really plan this far ahead?

02:34:07.020 --> 02:34:07.260
Yes.

02:34:09.180 --> 02:34:09.420
Yeah.

02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:12.620
I literally have on the calendar

02:34:12.620 --> 02:34:17.180
the May 4th Lego Star Wars Complete Saga.

02:34:17.180 --> 02:34:18.860
Like, yes, I plan this far ahead.

02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:21.580
And I change things out, okay?

02:34:22.540 --> 02:34:23.900
The OG or the new...

02:34:23.900 --> 02:34:25.340
Which God of War?

02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:29.900
Wait, is it PS PlayStation only?

02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:32.780
Yes, if you'll stop me.

02:34:32.940 --> 02:34:33.980
Yes, if you'll stop me.

02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:40.460
Is it PS PlayStation only?

02:34:40.460 --> 02:34:41.660
That might have to get changed.

02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:48.540
The question should be if she's supposed to plan that far ahead?

02:34:48.540 --> 02:34:49.740
Oh, I never read that.

02:34:49.740 --> 02:34:50.940
No, don't message me that.

02:34:50.940 --> 02:34:52.300
I've never read it in time.

02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:54.380
You are a planner.

02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:56.540
God of War is on PC.

02:34:56.540 --> 02:34:58.300
Okay, that'll be the one I'm playing then.

02:34:58.300 --> 02:34:59.420
The one that's on PC.

02:34:59.420 --> 02:34:59.980
So we're there.

02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:04.940
I hope you like Bioshock Infinite.

02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:05.260
Yes.

02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:07.020
What games are we talking about?

02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:08.140
That's PlayStation exclusive.

02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:10.780
I thought there was a God of War game that was PlayStation exclusive.

02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:14.220
Look at these feet.

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.300
This is me cricketing.

02:35:18.300 --> 02:35:19.340
You ever heard of a woman like,

02:35:19.340 --> 02:35:20.780
I'm cricketing my feet.

02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:21.260
This is it.

02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:23.100
It's literally just a self-soothing behavior.

02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:23.980
There's nothing more to it.

02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:24.780
And it's a bit warm.

02:35:25.820 --> 02:35:27.660
Teasing strong even redacted messages

02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:29.260
because she can't read them in time.

02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:31.500
No, it wakes me up.

02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:33.340
I luckily, I caught that.

02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:34.220
But oh yeah.

02:35:34.940 --> 02:35:36.540
Oh, it really inverts my nipples

02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:38.300
when I'm like reading halfway through your message

02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:39.020
and then you're done.

02:35:39.020 --> 02:35:41.900
I'm like, never got to finish it.

02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:44.380
It wasn't me.

02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:47.180
Damn, came at the best time.

02:35:47.180 --> 02:35:48.220
The wrap up, yeah.

02:35:49.100 --> 02:35:51.260
The original ones are P.O.A. station.

02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:51.580
Yeah.

02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:53.340
Momay.

02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:54.940
Yeah.

02:35:54.940 --> 02:35:55.900
Wait, what did I say?

02:35:56.940 --> 02:35:57.820
Strony, I love you.

02:35:57.820 --> 02:35:58.940
I love you too, this one.

02:35:58.940 --> 02:35:59.420
It what?

02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:00.220
Wait, what?

02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:01.820
Am I getting, did I say something?

02:36:04.380 --> 02:36:05.260
Do you think we could do

02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:07.900
Trouble in Terror's Town Gmod Streams

02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:09.260
now if you're the one hosting that?

02:36:10.540 --> 02:36:11.180
Possibly.

02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:15.020
I'll need to see if it shows IP or anything

02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:16.540
like that, but possibly.

02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:18.220
I think it's held by Gmod servers.

02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:20.540
Oh, my nipples being inverted.

02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:21.420
Yes, sorry.

02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:22.860
Sorry.

02:36:22.860 --> 02:36:24.780
I said, stop doing redacted.

02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:26.540
I have no clue what users are saying.

02:36:26.540 --> 02:36:27.420
No, I scoopy do.

02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:29.740
Do you want tummy pics?

02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:31.100
Am I allowed tummy pics?

02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:34.860
Stop, I can't fucking read.

02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:36.380
Strony, try not to overthink.

02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:38.780
It's because I finished like my thingy

02:36:40.620 --> 02:36:41.900
so quickly, like I don't,

02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:44.460
I'm already onto the next topic

02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:45.660
that I'm talking about

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:50.300
that I've no got a clue what's going on.

02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:53.100
Yeah, I've got one more hand cam stream

02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:55.180
on October, then I have nothing planned after that.

02:36:55.180 --> 02:36:57.020
So if you're sick of seeing me

02:36:57.020 --> 02:36:59.260
and not a Vtuber model,

02:36:59.260 --> 02:37:01.500
it's because I did just a lot,

02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:02.940
okay, but I'm wrapping it up.

02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:05.020
I'm wrapping up.

02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:07.580
Give mommy a head tap.

02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:09.180
Stop with the redacted.

02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:10.300
I'm missing them all.

02:37:10.300 --> 02:37:11.740
One of the two new God of War games

02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:13.260
in the first one is a PC.

02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:14.380
I missed that, right?

02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:15.340
What is redacted?

02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:17.900
When you delete your message,

02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:21.340
it says for me, message retracted.

02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:24.700
Oh, those are two different words.

02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:27.100
Retracted is take them back.

02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:30.220
Redacted is hidden information and adult feeling.

02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:31.020
Okay.

02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:34.620
It's not as, stop!

02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:36.380
I was just saying that!

02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:37.820
Mommy is super sad.

02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:38.540
Thank you.

02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:39.980
Redacted is a joke from S.E.C.

02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:42.620
about where the S.E.C. writer says,

02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:44.060
Shania, I deleted my message

02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:46.700
if I make a minor spelling error.

02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:47.820
You struggle reading as it is.

02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:48.940
I don't want to make it harder.

02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:50.140
Okay, real unsure though.

02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:52.860
We love to shume regardless with this hand.

02:37:53.500 --> 02:37:55.420
I can't even read.

02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:58.140
See how it even shows up in the hang?

02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:00.460
It just says, it's just gone.

02:38:00.460 --> 02:38:01.260
It's just no there.

02:38:03.500 --> 02:38:05.260
Wait, before you,

02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:08.460
I wanted to say that I think you're really funny

02:38:08.460 --> 02:38:09.180
and you're my ocean.

02:38:09.180 --> 02:38:10.380
Well, get right, I get right.

02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:12.780
Are you doing okay?

02:38:12.780 --> 02:38:14.860
Yeah, they're keeping me for a few more weeks

02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:16.300
at the asylum, as you can see,

02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:17.820
by the certified grippy socks.

02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:21.260
But no, we had a really good Pokémon haul.

02:38:21.260 --> 02:38:21.820
I enjoyed that.

02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.420
I'm not buying more Pokémon though, fuck that.

02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:33.900
Not one, I genuinely haven't had one.

02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:37.020
Unless I missed it or it got blocked by the filters,

02:38:37.020 --> 02:38:38.140
I generally haven't had one.

02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:41.500
Generally haven't had one.

02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:44.540
As I was saying, I think I've scared yous all.

02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:46.620
Like, I think yous are scared of me

02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:48.620
because I don't really get much

02:38:49.420 --> 02:38:51.020
hmm and stuff and I'm like,

02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:52.220
I think I'm just scared yous.

02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:55.100
But then a refland sent me a marshmallow

02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:55.820
and they were like,

02:38:58.460 --> 02:39:00.060
like, I feel satisfied.

02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:02.380
Like, I don't need to be a tumor anymore.

02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:04.140
I'm just happy he's like watching you

02:39:04.140 --> 02:39:05.820
and I'm like, oh, tea.

02:39:07.500 --> 02:39:09.260
And I'm like, oh, okay.

02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:13.660
Thank you, big belly-ing for the tip.

02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:17.100
It's just weird to send that stuff randomly.

02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:19.180
Oh, I mean,

02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:24.300
do I need to, I'm down?

02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:28.700
Do it real.

02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:31.500
He's spitting real facts.

02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:33.900
Oh, well someone said that.

02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:35.740
They were like, I used to be a chronic

02:39:36.460 --> 02:39:38.940
anchor but I'm not anymore.

02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:42.700
And I was like, aren't I the problem though?

02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:46.060
Because like, I do like non-stop,

02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:49.340
shut the fuck up in about ink and this and teasing and that.

02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:50.620
And I'm like, aren't I the problem?

02:39:50.620 --> 02:39:53.660
But the refland says no.

02:39:53.660 --> 02:39:54.700
And I'm like, okay.

02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:55.820
But aren't I the problem though?

02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:56.300
But no.

02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:03.260
Mummy, did you know redactors yet?

02:40:03.260 --> 02:40:03.820
What?

02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:05.500
Don't worry, I'll turn just a minute.

02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:08.460
Don't be shy, put some more.

02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:10.300
I don't want to be hate, I just want to be happy.

02:40:10.300 --> 02:40:13.180
Yeah, yeah, like basically I think

02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:14.460
is what I boil down to.

02:40:16.220 --> 02:40:20.220
Hmm, don't send unasked for stuff

02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:21.900
if a thing does get full though.

02:40:21.900 --> 02:40:24.220
I guess I'm such an exception to the rule.

02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:27.260
I think actually I want to just do the brainworn stuff a bit more.

02:40:27.260 --> 02:40:29.580
I was like, I'm going to be honest,

02:40:30.300 --> 02:40:33.340
have you been fucked up by a VTuber before?

02:40:33.340 --> 02:40:36.060
Because you're so terrified to like say these things to me

02:40:36.060 --> 02:40:37.340
or do things around me.

02:40:37.340 --> 02:40:40.620
I'm like, what nasty VTuber had a reaction to you

02:40:40.620 --> 02:40:43.260
that was so visceral to make you so cautious?

02:40:43.980 --> 02:40:46.620
Like, was someone nasty to you?

02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:48.540
Do I need to go speak to the manager?

02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:52.300
Like that's such a shame.

02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:56.380
I feel really bad that whenever you interact,

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:57.500
instead of being like,

02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:59.740
oh, strong is like having a hoot and a holler,

02:41:01.660 --> 02:41:03.260
you're like, oh my god, I've messed up.

02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:04.780
She's going to end up blocking me,

02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:05.820
muting me or whatever that.

02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:08.300
Like, I assure you I've not muted one motherfucking person.

02:41:08.300 --> 02:41:11.740
I've muted two people on Marshmallow.

02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:13.580
One was harassment,

02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:17.420
and then the other one was really random racism

02:41:17.420 --> 02:41:18.620
that wasn't even shown at me.

02:41:19.420 --> 02:41:20.780
That was a bit bizarre.

02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:22.700
I don't know what about, I can't decide for the message.

02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:25.180
Not VTubers, but girls.

02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:27.500
Most VTubers don't like weird comments.

02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:28.860
Oh boy!

02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:31.020
You are in for a treat over at your home.

02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:32.860
It's not even just online.

02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:34.380
It's what we've been taught in Relay.

02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:38.460
I mean, I guess in Relay,

02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:40.940
you wouldn't like go up to some random check

02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:43.420
and it can be like, hmm, your feet.

02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:45.660
But you know, here.

02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:47.580
And the gloves are fucking off, okay?

02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:48.380
My gloves are off.

02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:49.580
Feet!

02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:50.300
Hi, DEMPA.

02:41:50.300 --> 02:41:51.740
Sorry, we've wrapped up the Pokemon,

02:41:51.740 --> 02:41:53.820
but we did play Pokemon for real for real, okay?

02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:54.940
Look, it's real.

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:56.540
I promise I opened up Pokemon.

02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:57.980
It may not look like it, but yeah.

02:41:59.740 --> 02:42:02.780
I inked DEMPA real once.

02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:04.220
I think it's just good manners.

02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:05.820
The world has been hard on the phyllis,

02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:06.700
darling, you know.

02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:09.180
Culture is told is not to be openly,

02:42:09.740 --> 02:42:10.860
hmm.

02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:11.820
I guess, yeah.

02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:13.900
No, I do understand that.

02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:15.180
I guess that would explain why

02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:16.860
some overthinking comes into it,

02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:19.580
because I do feel bad when,

02:42:19.580 --> 02:42:21.500
like, we have a carry-on on streaming and,

02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:25.580
you know, I'll go brainwrote for a bit

02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:26.940
and then I'll check Marshmallow

02:42:26.940 --> 02:42:27.900
and it's apologies.

02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:29.900
And I'm like, what are you apologizing for?

02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:31.340
We're having fun together.

02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:33.740
We're playing games together.

02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:34.700
We're chatting.

02:42:34.700 --> 02:42:35.900
We're, I'm reading chat.

02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:36.940
I'm reading you.

02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:38.220
I know there's lurkers,

02:42:38.940 --> 02:42:40.620
if you're lurking in the shadow, don't be.

02:42:41.180 --> 02:42:42.620
Don't feel forced to talk,

02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:44.140
but, like, I know you're there

02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:45.500
and you're just bitching in.

02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:46.940
There's a man, I'm bitching in.

02:42:47.980 --> 02:42:49.500
Wait, people send apologies?

02:42:49.500 --> 02:42:50.220
I kid you not.

02:42:50.220 --> 02:42:51.580
People, like, are literally, like,

02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:53.100
strongy, I'm sorry that I did this,

02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:53.580
I did that.

02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:55.340
And I'm like, oh my God,

02:42:55.340 --> 02:42:57.340
like, you've actually been so fucked up

02:42:57.340 --> 02:42:59.100
because of something before.

02:42:59.100 --> 02:42:59.740
Hin Law.

02:42:59.740 --> 02:43:00.780
Hi, lurker here.

02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:01.980
Hi, lurker.

02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:02.940
Lurker Ling.

02:43:02.940 --> 02:43:03.980
We'll call you lurkers.

02:43:04.620 --> 02:43:07.260
Um, mm-mm-mm.

02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:09.340
But yeah, like, uh, hello, lurker.

02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:09.980
Hi.

02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:12.620
Oh, you're being brave, little lurkers.

02:43:13.980 --> 02:43:15.500
Are you feeling the pressure?

02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:17.420
Did your heart rate go up when you typed?

02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:19.900
Lurker Love.

02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:21.580
Yes, I know you're a little lurker.

02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:23.500
You're allowed to lurk, it's fine.

02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:25.340
Um, I'm not, like, feel the pressure,

02:43:25.340 --> 02:43:27.580
like, you must talk or anything like that.

02:43:27.580 --> 02:43:29.340
I feel a genuine level of acceptance,

02:43:29.340 --> 02:43:30.300
more freedom in a sense.

02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:31.820
Brain feels better when I sit in stream,

02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:33.900
whether it's lurking or participating.

02:43:33.900 --> 02:43:35.340
We are gentlemen first.

02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:36.620
Oh my God, hold on, wait.

02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:37.660
Wait, I have the sound bite.

02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:39.740
Oh no, I don't, because it's not popping up.

02:43:39.740 --> 02:43:40.700
A true gentleman.

02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:44.220
Um, I almost had a heart attack.

02:43:44.220 --> 02:43:45.180
Oh my God, stop!

02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:46.460
Wait, am I elevating your stream?

02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:48.860
I was a lurker before the stream, yeah.

02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:50.220
No, you're allowed to be lurker.

02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:51.820
For any lurker that's, like, I don't,

02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:52.780
I'm too scared.

02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:54.460
Don't worry, you don't have to,

02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:56.940
you don't have to say anything like a true gentleman.

02:43:56.940 --> 02:43:58.940
Um, I'm just straight up lurking.

02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:01.980
And by it, let's just say my beacher bird.

02:44:01.980 --> 02:44:03.420
Okay, that was really good.

02:44:03.420 --> 02:44:05.260
You win comment of the stream.

02:44:06.940 --> 02:44:08.060
Plop, plop, plop, plop.

02:44:08.060 --> 02:44:09.340
You win comment of the stream.

02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:10.380
That was actually really good.

02:44:10.940 --> 02:44:12.380
I'm a gentleman and a scholar,

02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:13.660
but I like Dom's one.

02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:14.700
Oh, you like Dom me?

02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:18.380
Okay, thankfully I didn't send one.

02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:21.260
I find it very hard sometimes having brain worms in the path

02:44:21.260 --> 02:44:22.460
and I felt like sending me apology.

02:44:22.460 --> 02:44:23.260
Good thing I didn't.

02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:24.460
No, it's not a bother.

02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:26.940
No, don't get brain worms if I haven't brain worms

02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:27.740
and apologize.

02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:31.980
Don't get brain worms if you've apologized either.

02:44:31.980 --> 02:44:33.980
Hold on, pause, pause.

02:44:33.980 --> 02:44:35.660
Don't get brain worms either.

02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:37.020
It's okay to apologize,

02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:39.420
but what I'm trying to say is you don't like to apologize.

02:44:40.380 --> 02:44:41.180
Wait, grug?

02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:43.180
Grug like women.

02:44:43.180 --> 02:44:44.220
Grug like men in prayer?

02:44:44.860 --> 02:44:46.300
Grug as in red?

02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:46.620
Grug?

02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:50.380
Red, is that you?

02:44:52.700 --> 02:44:55.660
Thank you, bab, for the tip, my little guru guru.

02:44:56.620 --> 02:44:58.380
Oh no, the brain worms have brain worms.

02:44:58.380 --> 02:44:58.700
No.

02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:04.060
Is that red or am I just...

02:45:04.780 --> 02:45:06.220
Brain worms squared?

02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:10.700
I feel like if you read more suggestive and you rap positive,

02:45:10.700 --> 02:45:12.860
it's all good, but I'm not saying anything wrong with either.

02:45:12.860 --> 02:45:14.140
You're too kind, I love you.

02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:15.180
I love you, sir, you're fun.

02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:15.660
Oh, hi.

02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:17.980
Oh, hi there.

02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:19.660
Oh, should I start calling lurkers out?

02:45:19.660 --> 02:45:20.940
No, that puts you on the spot.

02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:21.580
That's not fun.

02:45:22.220 --> 02:45:26.540
Sometimes it's tough to be a gentleman and a bit on the side.

02:45:26.540 --> 02:45:27.100
Don't worry.

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:32.940
I lurked two weeks before I interacted with you for the first thing

02:45:32.940 --> 02:45:35.820
because I want to have a good idea of what it's okay to say to you.

02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:38.460
No, I feel like literally I have to be like,

02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:42.060
all right, reflins, remember when we go into other people's streams,

02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:43.100
they're not like me.

02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:46.700
Grug as in a caveman.

02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:48.860
Ah, okay, okay, I'm mistaken identity.

02:45:48.860 --> 02:45:53.100
My apologies, guru, at the door via a doorbell.

02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:56.860
Oh god, now I have to apologize even harder.

02:45:56.860 --> 02:45:57.660
No.

02:45:57.660 --> 02:45:59.340
You're not to apologize even harder.

02:45:59.340 --> 02:45:59.740
Stop it.

02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:04.460
Hey.

02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:08.780
Mom, I like to send you an ink tax.

02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:10.460
What the fuck?

02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:11.100
That's so good.

02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:14.140
The ink tax, the ink tax.

02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:17.900
Mommy's tried hard, so you better pay the price.

02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:20.460
The ink tax, the ink tax.

02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:23.900
Mommy's been a tease, so you better call for that.

02:46:24.460 --> 02:46:26.300
So anyway, when it comes to talking to you during streams,

02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:28.140
I get nervous when talking.

02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:31.100
I find you so beautifully attractive and you get nervous.

02:46:31.100 --> 02:46:31.420
No.

02:46:32.940 --> 02:46:33.900
Are your feet cold?

02:46:33.900 --> 02:46:34.860
They actually are.

02:46:34.860 --> 02:46:37.340
I'm getting a bit chilly.

02:46:37.340 --> 02:46:38.540
I'm getting a bit chilly.

02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:39.500
Are you okay?

02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:40.380
I'm getting a bit chilly.

02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:40.860
Is that cool?

02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:44.780
I don't chat often in streams or really post comments.

02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:46.780
I felt like the eye of Saruman found me

02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:48.220
when you replied to my comment.

02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:52.540
Do you have a ring for me?

02:46:53.500 --> 02:46:56.220
Do you still have the cherry associated with that ring?

02:46:58.300 --> 02:46:59.500
I really love you all so much.

02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:01.580
I'm a lurker, nine times out of 10, but when...

02:47:02.300 --> 02:47:03.500
But I talk when I can.

02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:04.620
I really love you all so much.

02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:06.380
Aw, Riefling.

02:47:06.380 --> 02:47:08.300
You guys are super funny and sweet and lovely.

02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:09.500
Thanks for having me, Riefling.

02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:11.100
Aw, that was so nice.

02:47:11.100 --> 02:47:11.660
Thank you.

02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:15.020
Hey, I wonder if she realized she's reacting with her feet again.

02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:16.700
Meow.

02:47:19.500 --> 02:47:21.580
No, you can't prove it, okay?

02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:24.460
I am the danger.

02:47:24.460 --> 02:47:27.260
What if you tell them that they apologize to get punished?

02:47:27.260 --> 02:47:28.380
I feel like they'd want that.

02:47:29.340 --> 02:47:32.220
That Riefling experience, the whole body turns up.

02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:33.500
Bless all.

02:47:35.660 --> 02:47:36.540
Does it make you...

02:47:36.540 --> 02:47:38.220
I like when you tell me stories,

02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:40.780
like it makes you smile when I read your message.

02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:43.420
I'm like, ah, I can't handle it.

02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:44.940
It's so fucking cute.

02:47:44.940 --> 02:47:48.620
Like the thought of you cheesing behind your keyboard right now.

02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:50.700
Stop being so cute.

02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:51.740
I'm gonna do it.

02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:53.820
I'm gonna start passing out the R-word.

02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:57.180
And like the thought of you cheesing behind your little keyboard

02:47:57.180 --> 02:47:59.260
is so cute.

02:47:59.260 --> 02:48:00.700
It's so fucking cute.

02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:04.380
The chat reflects the true word.

02:48:04.380 --> 02:48:05.340
Shawnee is so cute.

02:48:05.340 --> 02:48:06.940
That's why you start quivering, dimple.

02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:09.180
Cuteness aggression.

02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:11.820
I mean, of course, we get happy if you read our message.

02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:14.060
We are shy when you do that.

02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:17.500
That happens to everyone.

02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:18.460
Riefling.

02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:19.580
You stop being so cute.

02:48:19.580 --> 02:48:20.860
It happens to me through real.

02:48:24.380 --> 02:48:27.020
The amount of dopamine I get when you read my chat message

02:48:27.420 --> 02:48:31.340
or when I get a like from you on Twitter since we're flying.

02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:33.980
Oh, I don't, I'm really bad at using Twitter.

02:48:33.980 --> 02:48:35.100
Actually, I'll tell you what.

02:48:35.100 --> 02:48:36.940
I've got a funny Twitter post.

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:38.300
I'm gonna post this in TM.

02:48:40.220 --> 02:48:41.900
You better start our wordness then.

02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:43.020
Oh, deals of deals.

02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:44.380
Shit, you got me.

02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:45.340
You caught me.

02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:46.780
All right, line up.

02:48:46.780 --> 02:48:47.500
Line up.

02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:48.060
Who's first?

02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:52.700
Twitter hate, honestly.

02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:54.140
I'm just rubbish actually.

02:48:54.940 --> 02:48:57.580
I told the giggle when I got a comment right out there.

02:48:57.580 --> 02:48:58.380
I need squid mirrors though.

02:48:58.380 --> 02:48:59.260
No need for them.

02:49:00.140 --> 02:49:02.620
Brain dead VTuber fan.

02:49:02.620 --> 02:49:04.540
You're not brain dead.

02:49:04.540 --> 02:49:05.260
You have to be nice.

02:49:05.260 --> 02:49:07.420
You need to name yourself positive things.

02:49:07.420 --> 02:49:10.940
You should call yourself two brain cell VTuber fan.

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:11.820
There's your new.

02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:14.300
And then you can celebrate each new brain cell yet.

02:49:14.300 --> 02:49:15.180
Thank you for coming to member.

02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:16.940
Please enjoy your moments.

02:49:16.940 --> 02:49:18.940
Stream went from wholesome to hate to wholesome.

02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:21.260
Yeah, that, yeah.

02:49:21.260 --> 02:49:21.980
Not gonna lie.

02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:23.820
That stuff kind of happens around here.

02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:25.020
Witness me.

02:49:25.020 --> 02:49:26.300
Me, me, me, I'm fine.

02:49:27.020 --> 02:49:28.860
Brain raw VTuber fan.

02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:31.820
Well, honestly, if you're a member for me, I'll take it.

02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:33.580
Stop redacting your messages.

02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:36.380
I sent some letters during dead hours.

02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:39.020
I'm so embarrassed to hear you read it on stream.

02:49:39.020 --> 02:49:41.500
You get embarrassed, but your marshmallows are anonymous.

02:49:42.060 --> 02:49:42.860
I can't even tell.

02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:46.300
Sorry for not having sent a marshmallow yet.

02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:47.020
Please forgive me.

02:49:47.020 --> 02:49:48.460
No, don't be sorry.

02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:50.700
That's, don't, don't be sorry.

02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:52.620
Our wordness is gonna start happening if we start.

02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:53.420
Mmm.

02:49:55.100 --> 02:49:56.860
You just typed message redacted.

02:49:56.860 --> 02:49:58.220
That's not actually been redacted.

02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:00.540
Welcome to strongy stream.

02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:01.580
If it's your first time.

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:05.020
Hi.

02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:07.900
Did I pop your cherry?

02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:08.860
Maybe a little bit.

02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:11.660
Little cherry popping today.

02:50:11.660 --> 02:50:13.100
If you see me for the first time.

02:50:14.220 --> 02:50:14.940
Oh, fuck.

02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:16.060
My ankle's about to crack.

02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:16.380
Sorry.

02:50:17.660 --> 02:50:19.260
Ah, my ankle's about to crack.

02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:20.380
Sorry, mommy.

02:50:20.380 --> 02:50:22.220
I apologize for not giving a fuck.

02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:23.420
Yes.

02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:25.980
I saw that.

02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:27.500
I read yes before you got it.

02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:29.260
I'm sorry for that.

02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:30.540
Reefling being sorry.

02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:30.780
Okay.

02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:31.980
Oh, wait.

02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:32.540
Hold on.

02:50:32.540 --> 02:50:34.860
I'll tell you how I get used to stop saying sorry.

02:50:35.500 --> 02:50:39.100
I'll tell you how I'll get used to stop saying sorry.

02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:40.940
You already know.

02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:44.060
You already know.

02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:49.180
I know how I'm gonna, I see one more sorry.

02:50:49.260 --> 02:50:52.700
And if I see one more sorry in that chat.

02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:54.540
It's getting done.

02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:56.700
Please don't.

02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:57.580
I'm sorry, mommy.

02:50:57.580 --> 02:50:58.140
Don't do it.

02:50:58.140 --> 02:50:58.700
Don't do it.

02:51:00.220 --> 02:51:00.860
Message.

02:51:00.860 --> 02:51:01.420
Sorry.

02:51:01.420 --> 02:51:02.140
Sorry.

02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:02.540
Okay.

02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:03.420
You're getting punished.

02:51:05.180 --> 02:51:06.540
Naughty refling.

02:51:07.660 --> 02:51:07.900
Yeah.

02:51:07.900 --> 02:51:09.180
You feel that pressure?

02:51:10.540 --> 02:51:11.420
Bad boy.

02:51:11.420 --> 02:51:12.700
You know, bad boy.

02:51:13.980 --> 02:51:14.780
See this?

02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:19.100
We're totally punished.

02:51:19.100 --> 02:51:20.460
Bad refling.

02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:22.460
Don't do it.

02:51:22.460 --> 02:51:23.340
It's too late.

02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:24.220
It's too late.

02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:27.500
I'll threaten again.

02:51:27.500 --> 02:51:28.620
Look, I'm threatening again.

02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:29.340
No more s's.

02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:31.340
Message.

02:51:31.340 --> 02:51:31.740
Sorry.

02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:32.300
Reduct.

02:51:34.060 --> 02:51:35.340
But what about gen two?

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:38.380
I think we're like what, a month?

02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:39.740
No.

02:51:42.700 --> 02:51:43.500
Oh, shit.

02:51:45.420 --> 02:51:47.500
I'm gonna be pregnant in less than a month.

02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:49.980
Oh my god.

02:51:49.980 --> 02:51:51.420
It's the 17th today.

02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:54.220
Oh no.

02:51:54.220 --> 02:51:54.860
This can't be.

02:51:55.740 --> 02:51:58.860
I'm gonna be pregnant in a fucking month with gen two.

02:51:58.860 --> 02:51:59.100
Shit.

02:52:00.780 --> 02:52:01.100
Shit.

02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:06.940
Better get your tentacles ready.

02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:09.180
We're gonna need a big load for gen two.

02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:12.700
Prepare yourself.

02:52:12.700 --> 02:52:13.020
Yes.

02:52:13.660 --> 02:52:14.460
Dying less fast.

02:52:15.260 --> 02:52:17.420
No, I need to get pregnant with them.

02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:18.540
I need to be pregnant with them.

02:52:18.540 --> 02:52:19.900
I'm getting pregnant on my birthday.

02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:22.700
I've got some work to do.

02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:26.540
Is that what you're denialings are for?

02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:29.500
Do you get a special model?

02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:30.780
When I'm pregnant,

02:52:32.620 --> 02:52:34.860
you want me to have a special toggle?

02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:36.140
I think it would cost a lot.

02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:38.460
Uh, I don't know.

02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:39.820
Do you want me to fucking...

02:52:40.860 --> 02:52:44.380
Oh, my big swollen belly with my big swollen milkers?

02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:46.620
You want a pregnant version of Strawny?

02:52:46.620 --> 02:52:47.180
Jesus.

02:52:49.420 --> 02:52:49.980
Jesus.

02:52:51.980 --> 02:52:52.300
Yes.

02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:55.900
Is there anyone that's done a prego feature for model?

02:52:57.580 --> 02:52:59.580
I just want you to see where Dune's cuddle.

02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:01.820
I'm not gonna do three-deal.

02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:03.660
You can't hear when I cuddle this microphone.

02:53:03.660 --> 02:53:04.460
It's so annoying.

02:53:04.460 --> 02:53:05.340
I can, like, rub it.

02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:07.980
That's gonna scare the new people away.

02:53:07.980 --> 02:53:09.980
Yeah, I think that's probably more of an incident joke.

02:53:09.980 --> 02:53:11.020
Yeah, no, pregnant.

02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:13.420
Kids, just place the prego barely P&D on top.

02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:15.420
Yeah, that's a lot cheaper as well.

02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:15.900
You know what?

02:53:15.900 --> 02:53:16.220
You're right.

02:53:16.220 --> 02:53:17.180
That's a lot cheaper.

02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:18.300
Stretch marks, Strawny.

02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:20.060
I already have them on my thighs.

02:53:20.060 --> 02:53:24.460
I used to be a plank, and then when puberty hit,

02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:28.380
my hips, like, doubled in size overnight.

02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:29.660
It was bizarre.

02:53:29.660 --> 02:53:30.780
It was truly bizarre.

02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:31.740
So I have, like, stretch...

02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:34.140
Like, did they call them tiger stripes or something there?

02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:35.660
It's not stretch marks anymore.

02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:37.900
But I have them on my thighs and my hips.

02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:38.700
And no, my thighs.

02:53:38.700 --> 02:53:39.580
Sorry, my hips.

02:53:40.540 --> 02:53:41.420
Hips only.

02:53:41.420 --> 02:53:41.740
Brea...

02:53:43.260 --> 02:53:43.740
Proof?

02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:46.620
Are you not seeing my...

02:53:46.620 --> 02:53:48.140
Oh, I don't have a shirt on under there.

02:53:49.580 --> 02:53:50.620
Okay, am I going crazy?

02:53:50.620 --> 02:53:51.980
Have I never showed you guys my...

02:53:55.020 --> 02:53:56.140
I don't know if you can tell.

02:53:56.140 --> 02:53:56.620
Hang on.

02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:58.460
I don't know if you can tell, because I'm like...

02:53:58.460 --> 02:53:59.260
Oh, you can't.

02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:00.140
Holy shit, you can't.

02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:01.660
Wait, no.

02:54:03.500 --> 02:54:04.620
Oh, you can't tell?

02:54:04.620 --> 02:54:05.900
Oh, I look like a plank.

02:54:05.900 --> 02:54:07.820
Oh, well, I'm not actually a plank.

02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:08.300
It's just...

02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:09.820
It's the bad camera angle, okay?

02:54:11.660 --> 02:54:12.700
I was like, have them on!

02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:15.660
You know, kind of go a little bit hip-pitch.

02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:17.180
You know, if you've ever been on the alt-wear.

02:54:17.980 --> 02:54:18.860
That's a lot of hip-pitch.

02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:20.940
You're a plank from the front.

02:54:20.940 --> 02:54:21.820
Yeah, there you go.

02:54:21.820 --> 02:54:22.300
Plank.

02:54:22.300 --> 02:54:22.780
Plank.

02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:23.260
Plank.

02:54:24.620 --> 02:54:26.060
I can't find my glasses.

02:54:26.060 --> 02:54:28.460
Hips for birthing veal or generations, literally.

02:54:29.420 --> 02:54:31.420
You edit it out of the picture.

02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:32.140
My hips?

02:54:34.140 --> 02:54:35.340
I smooth my skin.

02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:37.420
I don't have nice skin.

02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:38.220
Like, I have skin.

02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:40.540
Smooth the skin in my face, but I don't...

02:54:42.220 --> 02:54:43.020
Oh, the marks!

02:54:43.020 --> 02:54:43.980
Yeah, I edit the marks.

02:54:43.980 --> 02:54:44.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:45.100
The skin.

02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:45.980
I fix the skin.

02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:49.740
Try to remove everything.

02:54:50.620 --> 02:54:51.420
Birthing hips.

02:54:51.980 --> 02:54:53.020
Stony's personality.

02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:53.900
Breeding bros win.

02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:00.620
She has normal skin.

02:55:00.620 --> 02:55:01.340
The shock and horror.

02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:02.060
I know.

02:55:02.060 --> 02:55:02.700
It's terrible.

02:55:03.260 --> 02:55:05.580
Mummy, when you read my messages or when you, like,

02:55:05.580 --> 02:55:07.260
my art or, like, my tweet, I get embarrassed

02:55:07.260 --> 02:55:08.700
and I get butterflies in blood.

02:55:08.700 --> 02:55:09.900
I, like, run around my room and jump.

02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:11.020
Stop!

02:55:11.020 --> 02:55:12.060
That's so cute!

02:55:13.500 --> 02:55:14.140
Oh, my God.

02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:18.860
God, I want Stony to just grab me and drag me

02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:21.900
while I hyperventilate and grab for the furniture

02:55:21.900 --> 02:55:24.460
and walls while she takes me into a small dark room

02:55:24.460 --> 02:55:28.300
and all that is heard is muffled moans and wallbangs?

02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:34.940
Reeflyn, you have a very specific intro, don't you?

02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:36.700
We're on to you.

02:55:36.700 --> 02:55:38.620
You have a very specific intro.

02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:40.300
Yeah, no.

02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:42.300
Mmm.

02:55:43.020 --> 02:55:43.520
Mmm.

02:55:44.140 --> 02:55:45.820
Mummy, I love when you read my marrows.

02:55:45.820 --> 02:55:46.780
I sent all of them.

02:55:46.780 --> 02:55:48.860
Am I getting one reflinged here?

02:55:49.980 --> 02:55:50.460
Mmm.

02:55:52.300 --> 02:55:53.420
Hey, Stony.

02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:54.620
Hi, Reeflyn.

02:55:54.620 --> 02:55:56.380
Today, I went to Costco.

02:55:56.380 --> 02:55:57.740
It may not seem like a huge deal,

02:55:57.740 --> 02:55:59.900
but I normally get really anxious when going there

02:55:59.900 --> 02:56:00.620
and it's busy.

02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:02.700
Ah, I hate when it's busy as well.

02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:04.380
There's always a lot of people and I get overwhelmed,

02:56:04.380 --> 02:56:06.700
however, after I talked to you, even the little bit

02:56:06.700 --> 02:56:08.220
that I did, I was able to keep it together

02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:10.060
and not have to leave early this time.

02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:11.900
I thought back to how nervous I was talking to you,

02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:14.220
but how worth it it was to say I love you and it helped me.

02:56:14.220 --> 02:56:15.260
And thank you so much.

02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:16.300
Oh, Reeflyn!

02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:17.100
What the fuck?

02:56:17.100 --> 02:56:18.060
That's amazing.

02:56:19.260 --> 02:56:21.340
I'm glad you got your little cost...

02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:22.940
Oh, Costco!

02:56:22.940 --> 02:56:24.700
Wait, Costco's a supermarket.

02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:26.460
That's so good.

02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:27.660
Love you too, little Reeflyn.

02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:28.700
I'm so glad.

02:56:29.900 --> 02:56:31.900
See, it was in you all along though.

02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:34.940
You have to celebrate your victories.

02:56:34.940 --> 02:56:35.740
And that wasn't me.

02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:37.020
I wasn't in the shop way.

02:56:37.020 --> 02:56:37.660
That was you.

02:56:37.660 --> 02:56:38.220
You did that.

02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:39.500
You were doing fantastic.

02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:42.220
And that was you.

02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:43.580
I cannot read that fast.

02:56:43.580 --> 02:56:44.060
I saw that.

02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:45.100
I cannot read that fast.

02:56:45.100 --> 02:56:46.380
That was like a fucking essay and a half

02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:47.340
in the corner of my eye.

02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:48.620
I cannot read that fast.

02:56:48.620 --> 02:56:50.540
We're a figment of strong ease of imagination.

02:56:50.540 --> 02:56:51.260
You better not be.

02:56:51.260 --> 02:56:52.940
Either I'm going to be pregnant next month or not.

02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:56.060
Take responsibility.

02:56:56.780 --> 02:56:57.260
All right.

02:56:58.220 --> 02:57:00.860
If you're not rapping it, take responsibility.

02:57:02.300 --> 02:57:03.100
Meeting me pre...

02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:03.660
Six!

02:57:03.660 --> 02:57:05.180
I was pregnant with five.

02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:06.140
Now I'm pregnant with six.

02:57:06.140 --> 02:57:07.900
I can't read that fast either when I'm talking.

02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:11.500
I fantasise about not being each other aggressively

02:57:11.500 --> 02:57:12.940
while we exercise.

02:57:12.940 --> 02:57:15.260
One, two, three, four.

02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:17.980
That's basically if we're working out.

02:57:17.980 --> 02:57:19.420
That's how it's going to sound for me.

02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:21.740
Remember buying stuff in Costco during the pandemic?

02:57:23.660 --> 02:57:26.220
Have to pay child support through working on the farm.

02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:27.020
Yeah, working.

02:57:27.740 --> 02:57:28.380
Working.

02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:31.180
I'm sure we'll be harvesting anything from you on the farm.

02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:35.420
Everyone help for sins, mum and gen two.

02:57:36.460 --> 02:57:36.860
Yes.

02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:40.540
If we keep apologising, do we get grape time?

02:57:40.540 --> 02:57:40.940
Oh no.

02:57:48.860 --> 02:57:50.140
Nice zorks, yeah.

02:57:50.940 --> 02:57:52.540
You're like the mental asylum.

02:57:53.660 --> 02:57:55.500
That's the replete Alice Madness return.

02:57:58.140 --> 02:58:00.060
This would be the first time I actually would.

02:58:00.060 --> 02:58:01.180
So hesitation.

02:58:01.180 --> 02:58:03.980
Can we have a shotgun wedding after a prequel?

02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:06.460
Oh my god, do you want to do that?

02:58:06.540 --> 02:58:07.340
A little wedding rules.

02:58:08.780 --> 02:58:10.220
I need to figure out how to use both.

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:15.420
Both is how people have like outfits that their head is like a head is still on it.

02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:18.860
I don't know how to put a wedding dress on me.

02:58:19.580 --> 02:58:22.220
It's going to have to be wed and dress PNG.

02:58:22.220 --> 02:58:22.700
I'm sorry.

02:58:24.700 --> 02:58:27.180
We're going to have to consummate the marriage as well.

02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:27.820
Just so you know.

02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:31.180
Just so you know, we're going to have to consummate the marriage on that

02:58:31.180 --> 02:58:32.620
after the ASMR wedding.

02:58:32.620 --> 02:58:32.940
So.

02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:38.300
Mom, I tend to lurk for weeks because feeling comfortable commenting and live chats.

02:58:38.300 --> 02:58:41.340
Some communities can put you all for hostile but your community is so friendly,

02:58:41.340 --> 02:58:42.540
so comfortable typing stuff.

02:58:42.540 --> 02:58:44.060
Oh, I'm so glad.

02:58:44.860 --> 02:58:46.060
We've still got stinkings.

02:58:46.060 --> 02:58:46.940
She knows right?

02:58:46.940 --> 02:58:48.300
She can teach you.

02:58:48.300 --> 02:58:49.660
I don't want to be a bother.

02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:55.100
Shotgun wedding, hopefully, since one is hell.

02:58:55.100 --> 02:58:55.900
Yee-haw!

02:58:56.780 --> 02:58:58.140
That would murder me in real life.

02:58:58.140 --> 02:58:58.700
Worth it.

02:58:59.900 --> 02:59:01.500
We should get married before gen three.

02:59:02.140 --> 02:59:04.460
So when we consummate your prego with gen three?

02:59:05.100 --> 02:59:06.060
I don't know.

02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:06.700
Oh wait, no.

02:59:06.700 --> 02:59:07.900
Because that's speedrunning.

02:59:07.900 --> 02:59:08.300
No.

02:59:08.300 --> 02:59:09.420
I need a not...

02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:10.140
Bruh.

02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:10.460
This...

02:59:10.460 --> 02:59:12.620
The tank needs to be empty, okay?

02:59:12.620 --> 02:59:14.140
Morning, Scottish mummies.

02:59:14.140 --> 02:59:15.340
Good morning, this one.

02:59:18.060 --> 02:59:19.420
Thank you for the stream today.

02:59:19.420 --> 02:59:20.300
Did you enjoy it?

02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:21.580
Even though it's just me going...

02:59:22.220 --> 02:59:24.540
Oh, I was supposed to wrap up like 30 minutes ago.

02:59:24.540 --> 02:59:25.020
I'm weak.

02:59:26.940 --> 02:59:27.500
Hi, mummet.

02:59:27.500 --> 02:59:29.100
I don't know how much to say except a miss.

02:59:29.100 --> 02:59:29.820
Oh, I love you.

02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:30.300
Many kisses.

02:59:30.300 --> 02:59:30.700
Many kisses.

02:59:36.220 --> 02:59:36.940
Hey, mummet.

02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:41.100
Your streams have been quite some freedom for me.

02:59:41.100 --> 02:59:42.300
Freedom, you say?

02:59:42.300 --> 02:59:43.580
For the Scottish VTuber?

02:59:44.700 --> 02:59:46.540
It's a given around these parts.

02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:49.260
Big Willy Wallace didn't die for nothing.

02:59:49.820 --> 02:59:52.220
Freedom around for the Scottish VTuber.

02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:56.460
I have quite the perverse mind, isn't it?

02:59:56.460 --> 02:59:58.860
But I've been flamed by VTubers and communities before.

02:59:59.420 --> 03:00:03.740
And I kind of ganged up with hate mail because of it.

03:00:03.740 --> 03:00:04.540
Somewhere bad.

03:00:05.580 --> 03:00:08.540
So your streams have been quite enjoyment for me and for Incan

03:00:08.540 --> 03:00:10.540
and just having fun and positivity in my brain.

03:00:10.540 --> 03:00:11.340
Thank you for being here.

03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:14.060
Thank you for being here.

03:00:14.060 --> 03:00:18.220
I hope in the future I get a girlfriend who has your mindset and personality.

03:00:18.220 --> 03:00:18.940
I assure you.

03:00:20.220 --> 03:00:21.100
I ain't the only one...

03:00:22.060 --> 03:00:23.900
I'm not the only one built like this.

03:00:23.900 --> 03:00:27.660
You need autism, ADHD and an accent.

03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:28.140
And there you go.

03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:28.700
Boom.

03:00:29.180 --> 03:00:29.980
And that's it.

03:00:29.980 --> 03:00:30.620
That's all you need.

03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:34.220
So a little bit of microplastics on the brain to cause the autism

03:00:35.420 --> 03:00:38.540
and the ADHD and the rest is good to go.

03:00:40.220 --> 03:00:41.580
Good to go.

03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:42.540
Okay.

03:00:44.540 --> 03:00:48.140
Wedding is part of the doughnathon right before the first blue site stream.

03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:50.380
Oh, hold on a minute.

03:00:54.540 --> 03:00:57.420
Wedding is part of the doughnathon and then consummation.

03:00:58.700 --> 03:00:59.200
Hmm.

03:01:00.060 --> 03:01:00.560
Hmm.

03:01:01.660 --> 03:01:02.700
Hmm.

03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:04.380
Now we're playing 4D chess.

03:01:06.460 --> 03:01:07.500
I'm playing checkers.

03:01:07.500 --> 03:01:10.220
You're playing chess right now cause hmm.

03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:11.420
No, hold on.

03:01:11.420 --> 03:01:12.380
Let that man speak.

03:01:12.380 --> 03:01:13.260
Let that man speak.

03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:17.260
The first blue site could be the honeymoon.

03:01:17.260 --> 03:01:20.140
I think that would actually be very nice.

03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:21.660
I'm not sure about you.

03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:24.380
Mummy, when you read my marshmallow just hid better in my phone.

03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:26.380
Are you cheesing?

03:01:27.340 --> 03:01:30.380
I don't have a fetish but your feet and socks are cute.

03:01:30.380 --> 03:01:31.020
Thank you.

03:01:31.020 --> 03:01:32.620
I got them from the mental fund.

03:01:33.580 --> 03:01:34.860
Mummy, can I ink today?

03:01:36.060 --> 03:01:36.940
Are you being denied?

03:01:36.940 --> 03:01:37.660
Are you trying to skip?

03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:39.600
Hmm.

03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:41.340
From a lurker.

03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:41.820
I love you.

03:01:41.820 --> 03:01:43.660
I love you too, little lurkerling.

03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:44.620
You're so cute.

03:01:46.300 --> 03:01:50.860
Do you smell what the rooflings are cooking?

03:01:52.140 --> 03:01:52.940
Sounds really cute.

03:01:53.660 --> 03:01:54.860
Hmm.

03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:55.420
Hi, Strony.

03:01:55.420 --> 03:01:57.740
Sometimes I pitch a tent when you do those fake tears in them.

03:01:58.460 --> 03:01:59.260
What are you talking about?

03:01:59.260 --> 03:02:00.060
I'm just stretching.

03:02:02.060 --> 03:02:02.560
Ah.

03:02:03.500 --> 03:02:04.540
Ah.

03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:05.420
Just stretching.

03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:07.760
Yep.

03:02:13.260 --> 03:02:13.900
Nice hooves.

03:02:13.900 --> 03:02:15.180
Yeah, you like that.

03:02:15.180 --> 03:02:17.180
No.

03:02:21.180 --> 03:02:22.540
Your marshmallows go eh.

03:02:23.020 --> 03:02:24.620
I'm at four minutes ago.

03:02:24.620 --> 03:02:25.820
This is a double sentence.

03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:27.820
I don't know if I got caught if you did then ignore.

03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:28.700
Thank you for everything.

03:02:31.020 --> 03:02:32.300
Even though I have Enrily friends,

03:02:32.300 --> 03:02:33.980
I don't have much in common with them.

03:02:33.980 --> 03:02:34.780
Oh my God, I felt that.

03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:40.220
So I still feel a bit lonely not to mention that I'm 26.

03:02:40.220 --> 03:02:41.740
And oh, Jesus.

03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:43.500
I have yet to have a girlfriend.

03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:46.300
Veiler has been a massive help for my mental state.

03:02:46.300 --> 03:02:46.860
I didn't really...

03:02:48.380 --> 03:02:49.900
Wait a minute, you have cherries, don't you?

03:02:50.620 --> 03:02:53.820
I didn't really watch streamers before,

03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:55.340
but the girls are giving me nothing but joy.

03:02:55.340 --> 03:02:57.580
And it's not just the girls.

03:02:57.580 --> 03:02:59.260
Sorry, I'm reading a lot of English here.

03:02:59.260 --> 03:03:01.580
Being a part of the community of like-minded,

03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:05.260
independent jewels have finally given me a sense of belonging,

03:03:05.260 --> 03:03:06.540
especially during the Overwatch stream.

03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:09.580
Dropping around with you, chat, and the other guys in the lobby

03:03:09.580 --> 03:03:11.420
has made me the happiest I've been in quite a while.

03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:12.620
So again, I can't thank you enough.

03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:13.740
Honestly, I'm saddened a little bit.

03:03:13.740 --> 03:03:15.100
I'll never be able to repay you.

03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:16.940
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:19.100
You don't understand.

03:03:19.100 --> 03:03:22.060
I will never be able to repay...

03:03:22.060 --> 03:03:23.580
Wait, 26 is that what you said?

03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:24.860
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:03:24.860 --> 03:03:25.660
I'm sorry.

03:03:27.020 --> 03:03:27.980
No, I don't...

03:03:27.980 --> 03:03:29.900
Aren't most reeflings 30 plus?

03:03:29.900 --> 03:03:30.700
Oh, he is!

03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:31.660
Oh, that's kind of hot.

03:03:34.540 --> 03:03:37.420
You're over 30 and you're letting me control your ink.

03:03:38.540 --> 03:03:39.340
Oh, that's hot.

03:03:44.620 --> 03:03:46.700
You're letting me be in control.

03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:49.500
Oh, my God.

03:03:52.220 --> 03:03:54.060
Oh, my God.

03:03:54.060 --> 03:03:55.980
You're letting little old me,

03:03:57.020 --> 03:03:59.340
a little five foot three tiny,

03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:02.220
wainy little Spironee control your ink.

03:04:04.140 --> 03:04:04.700
Shocking.

03:04:06.140 --> 03:04:06.780
I'm 40.

03:04:06.780 --> 03:04:08.060
What does that mean?

03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:09.580
You have bloody good taste.

03:04:10.220 --> 03:04:11.180
Oh, my God.

03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:11.980
That's so good.

03:04:12.940 --> 03:04:15.500
She didn't know a big part is 30 plus.

03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:16.300
I guess not.

03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:19.580
32, 28, 20.

03:04:21.180 --> 03:04:22.540
Plenty of cherries on you.

03:04:24.940 --> 03:04:26.860
I could smell the cherries on you.

03:04:27.900 --> 03:04:29.740
I just turned 25 though.

03:04:29.740 --> 03:04:30.300
Okay.

03:04:30.300 --> 03:04:31.820
Because you're idly gonna...

03:04:31.820 --> 03:04:33.820
Because you're idly this when I tell you my age.

03:04:34.940 --> 03:04:36.860
We need to do a reefling demographic.

03:04:37.980 --> 03:04:39.100
Where are my other...

03:04:39.100 --> 03:04:40.460
I'm 23.

03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:41.500
Where am I 24?

03:04:43.020 --> 03:04:44.380
I can smell you.

03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:47.580
How old do you think the youngest person here is?

03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:47.980
18.

03:04:49.340 --> 03:04:52.620
No one else under is allowed to watch our advice system.

03:04:53.340 --> 03:04:54.140
We do not accept.

03:04:55.420 --> 03:04:56.460
36.

03:04:57.500 --> 03:04:58.620
The little spike ball.

03:04:59.500 --> 03:05:00.540
Goddamn.

03:05:01.660 --> 03:05:03.260
The real chair, boyhunter.

03:05:04.140 --> 03:05:04.700
Pull it.

03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:05.980
What?

03:05:05.980 --> 03:05:07.100
Like the average...

03:05:07.100 --> 03:05:07.580
Hold on.

03:05:07.580 --> 03:05:08.620
Wait, I can't do a pull.

03:05:09.660 --> 03:05:10.220
Oh, my God.

03:05:10.220 --> 03:05:12.220
I'm supposed to be working right now,

03:05:12.220 --> 03:05:13.820
but I like talking to you too much.

03:05:15.020 --> 03:05:16.140
Age range.

03:05:17.980 --> 03:05:19.100
Okay, add option.

03:05:19.100 --> 03:05:21.180
Let's do 18 to...

03:05:23.180 --> 03:05:23.900
24.

03:05:25.580 --> 03:05:27.660
25 to 30.

03:05:28.460 --> 03:05:31.900
31 to 35.

03:05:32.780 --> 03:05:34.620
And then 36 plus.

03:05:34.620 --> 03:05:35.900
And then true will do some.

03:05:39.580 --> 03:05:41.820
That's probably not how I was supposed to do it,

03:05:41.820 --> 03:05:42.940
but this is anonymous.

03:05:43.020 --> 03:05:44.940
Like, it's not a thing that you sell out.

03:05:44.940 --> 03:05:45.580
Do you see it?

03:05:49.660 --> 03:05:50.780
Wait, did I do it wrong?

03:05:50.780 --> 03:05:52.940
Are there any other reasons that are also from someone?

03:05:52.940 --> 03:05:54.540
36 plus dang.

03:05:54.540 --> 03:05:55.980
Real OG-san.

03:05:55.980 --> 03:05:57.020
True OG-san.

03:05:57.020 --> 03:05:58.540
Get their category.

03:05:58.540 --> 03:06:00.940
I mean, fucking look at me though.

03:06:00.940 --> 03:06:03.260
Like, I'm not being weird or funny,

03:06:03.260 --> 03:06:05.420
but like, I'm not being funny.

03:06:06.300 --> 03:06:08.700
Gomenasori, if you don't like seeing,

03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:12.860
you're letting me control your anger.

03:06:13.100 --> 03:06:13.740
Look at me.

03:06:15.260 --> 03:06:17.420
Do you understand how hot that is?

03:06:17.420 --> 03:06:18.140
I mean, shit.

03:06:18.780 --> 03:06:21.660
This is the size of a Pokemon card in my hand.

03:06:22.460 --> 03:06:25.100
And you're letting me control you?

03:06:25.100 --> 03:06:27.100
Come on, that's fucking hot.

03:06:27.100 --> 03:06:28.780
I don't care what anyone says.

03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:30.140
I don't care what anyone says.

03:06:31.660 --> 03:06:32.540
That is...

03:06:33.900 --> 03:06:35.180
That's each word.

03:06:35.180 --> 03:06:36.300
I don't care what anyone says.

03:06:36.860 --> 03:06:38.140
I mean, look at me.

03:06:38.140 --> 03:06:39.180
I write a bake.

03:06:39.180 --> 03:06:40.380
Like, fuck, and you're letting me...

03:06:41.340 --> 03:06:42.780
I'm a cyclist.

03:06:42.780 --> 03:06:45.660
I'm the lowest of the lowest scum, okay?

03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:50.620
You knew that?

03:06:50.620 --> 03:06:50.940
Okay.

03:06:52.380 --> 03:06:53.260
What can I say?

03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:54.060
I like your stat.

03:06:54.060 --> 03:06:56.220
I like your funny words, Scottish lady.

03:06:57.100 --> 03:06:59.100
Your hands are like half as big as mine.

03:06:59.100 --> 03:07:00.540
This is very plausible.

03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:03.420
Apparently I have very tiny hands in comparison to you guys, so...

03:07:05.980 --> 03:07:07.420
Oh my god, it says my name,

03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:09.900
my blood type, and social security after voting.

03:07:10.540 --> 03:07:12.220
I'm coming to your house now, got ya.

03:07:14.140 --> 03:07:14.700
Okay.

03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:15.660
Nah, you guys are...

03:07:15.660 --> 03:07:18.380
Yeah, you guys are getting my ages.

03:07:18.380 --> 03:07:19.420
She's a cyclist.

03:07:19.420 --> 03:07:22.540
Waterboard her with McDonald's spray, real.

03:07:22.540 --> 03:07:25.100
We just love you, Momela, you too, you son.

03:07:26.300 --> 03:07:27.020
Keep going on.

03:07:27.020 --> 03:07:28.460
Like, a bake cyclist?

03:07:28.460 --> 03:07:32.940
I cycle all the time, shoulder to shoulder, with semis.

03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:36.620
You've got a semi, you say?

03:07:36.620 --> 03:07:39.180
Sorry, you're being very serious with that sentence.

03:07:39.580 --> 03:07:43.980
I cycle on the pavements, which actually is illegal,

03:07:43.980 --> 03:07:45.580
because I could hit a pedestrian,

03:07:45.580 --> 03:07:47.980
but I don't want to go on the road,

03:07:47.980 --> 03:07:49.900
because I don't want to get ran over by a car team.

03:07:53.980 --> 03:07:57.740
Yeah, I'm a 36-year-old man who owns the house and has a job,

03:07:57.740 --> 03:07:59.020
and I'm on the other side of the road.

03:07:59.020 --> 03:08:00.620
Please control my ink, it's all for you.

03:08:00.620 --> 03:08:01.420
Fuck!

03:08:01.980 --> 03:08:03.180
That's crazy!

03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:06.060
But in a good way.

03:08:06.700 --> 03:08:07.500
No one did.

03:08:09.740 --> 03:08:10.380
Mmm.

03:08:10.380 --> 03:08:12.140
Hello, I'm the 26-year-old reflin.

03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:16.460
Yes, I still have every single chair you want it.

03:08:16.460 --> 03:08:17.260
Please!

03:08:17.260 --> 03:08:19.740
Oh my god, I need to do a fucking meta roleplay right now.

03:08:19.740 --> 03:08:21.900
You can't bike on the sidewalk on the pavement,

03:08:21.900 --> 03:08:24.300
like, where people walk, isn't it not?

03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:25.660
In Scotland, it's illegal,

03:08:25.660 --> 03:08:27.500
but the police never told me off for it.

03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:29.260
Like, the police used to see me a lot.

03:08:29.260 --> 03:08:30.780
Oh my fucking god.

03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:35.180
I used to see the same fucking egg to Polish men,

03:08:35.180 --> 03:08:36.620
like, day in, day out,

03:08:37.420 --> 03:08:38.620
and they'd always look at me,

03:08:38.620 --> 03:08:39.420
and I'd always be like,

03:08:39.420 --> 03:08:40.860
oh, you fuck, they're gonna say something,

03:08:40.860 --> 03:08:43.100
because it's like, you're not supposed to be on the pavement,

03:08:43.100 --> 03:08:45.340
or you'll get, like, because you can hurt someone.

03:08:45.980 --> 03:08:47.500
Evos, thank you for becoming a member.

03:08:47.500 --> 03:08:49.020
Please enjoy the emotes,

03:08:49.020 --> 03:08:50.140
and thank you for the support.

03:08:50.140 --> 03:08:51.340
Sorry, it's a bit fluff on my leg.

03:08:53.020 --> 03:08:57.420
But I look very visually quite young in real life,

03:08:57.420 --> 03:08:58.860
like, not on camera or whatever.

03:09:00.220 --> 03:09:01.740
Visually, I look quite young,

03:09:01.740 --> 03:09:04.220
and I think that's why the police never said nothing to me,

03:09:04.220 --> 03:09:05.260
because they were always like,

03:09:05.260 --> 03:09:07.020
oh, she's like a teenager,

03:09:07.020 --> 03:09:09.260
she's like still at high school and that kind of thing.

03:09:10.060 --> 03:09:12.060
To polis, the polis.

03:09:12.060 --> 03:09:14.460
Polis men, policemen, polis.

03:09:15.180 --> 03:09:16.060
A Shawnee gremlin.

03:09:16.780 --> 03:09:18.460
They have home, two cars,

03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:19.340
and live across the world.

03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:20.700
I always let you control my anger.

03:09:20.700 --> 03:09:21.500
Damn!

03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:25.740
I'm not sure how much you're controlling for the priority.

03:09:27.180 --> 03:09:27.900
Polis.

03:09:27.900 --> 03:09:30.140
All right, and so it's not a police in Scotland,

03:09:30.140 --> 03:09:31.660
it's the polis that are at the door,

03:09:31.660 --> 03:09:33.020
like, oh, the polis out here.

03:09:34.060 --> 03:09:34.940
You didn't really get,

03:09:35.660 --> 03:09:37.180
it's quite common to get, like,

03:09:37.180 --> 03:09:38.780
randomly spanked by the police,

03:09:38.780 --> 03:09:39.820
so don't be too worried

03:09:39.820 --> 03:09:41.500
as opposed to show up at your door.

03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:43.740
I'm out of cherries.

03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:44.860
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:09:44.860 --> 03:09:46.380
On the contrary, Riflin,

03:09:46.380 --> 03:09:48.540
I'm sure I can spawn in a few more for you.

03:09:50.460 --> 03:09:54.140
I'm sure there's a few first times I can have with you.

03:09:54.140 --> 03:09:55.820
I'm sure, but don't you worry.

03:09:55.820 --> 03:09:56.460
Don't you worry.

03:09:58.060 --> 03:09:59.260
I thought you said polis, no.

03:09:59.260 --> 03:10:00.300
Not polska.

03:10:00.300 --> 03:10:01.660
Nie, nie polska.

03:10:02.460 --> 03:10:03.580
Pokaż syski?

03:10:04.540 --> 03:10:05.420
Is that why I'm not?

03:10:06.380 --> 03:10:07.420
No polska today.

03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:09.660
Hi, Mummy.

03:10:09.660 --> 03:10:11.580
De-nailing here?

03:10:13.900 --> 03:10:15.580
Oh, denial-ing here?

03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:17.100
I edged too much.

03:10:18.460 --> 03:10:19.980
And opted to ruin it.

03:10:19.980 --> 03:10:21.420
Your audience is too hot and awful.

03:10:23.660 --> 03:10:24.460
Oh, my God.

03:10:24.460 --> 03:10:24.780
What?

03:10:24.780 --> 03:10:25.340
How many?

03:10:25.340 --> 03:10:26.220
Well, how long was your...

03:10:26.220 --> 03:10:26.940
Oh, we need to deal.

03:10:26.940 --> 03:10:28.940
I'll deal with, I'll deal with you

03:10:28.940 --> 03:10:30.140
in the membership stream.

03:10:30.300 --> 03:10:31.260
Thank you very much.

03:10:32.700 --> 03:10:34.860
Can we pull a new audio for Patreon?

03:10:34.860 --> 03:10:36.460
Um, there's a membership stream

03:10:36.460 --> 03:10:37.420
that we're writing this week

03:10:37.420 --> 03:10:38.700
for what you want,

03:10:38.700 --> 03:10:40.460
but in November,

03:10:40.460 --> 03:10:42.220
all Patreon contents

03:10:42.780 --> 03:10:44.380
becomes what you guys

03:10:44.380 --> 03:10:45.420
want me to write with you.

03:10:47.340 --> 03:10:48.860
32 owns a house and a job,

03:10:48.860 --> 03:10:50.460
and you stream the moment I go off work.

03:10:50.460 --> 03:10:52.060
So having someone control me

03:10:52.060 --> 03:10:53.020
after a tiny day

03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:54.700
is an extraordinary feeling.

03:10:54.700 --> 03:10:56.140
Oh, does it give you relief?

03:10:56.140 --> 03:10:57.740
But in more ways than one.

03:10:57.900 --> 03:11:01.820
Anyone want to buy Pokemon?

03:11:01.820 --> 03:11:03.420
Collector's binder?

03:11:04.460 --> 03:11:06.540
We got scum as with our binder, okay?

03:11:07.660 --> 03:11:08.700
Yeah, we got scum as.

03:11:09.580 --> 03:11:10.380
So many.

03:11:10.380 --> 03:11:11.660
Sorry if this is a repeater

03:11:11.660 --> 03:11:12.300
I got eaten.

03:11:12.300 --> 03:11:13.820
Here's my gripper video.

03:11:13.820 --> 03:11:14.460
Are you...

03:11:14.460 --> 03:11:17.340
You sent a video of your feet moving?

03:11:18.060 --> 03:11:20.380
As opposed to not moving.

03:11:21.340 --> 03:11:22.380
Oh, my gosh.

03:11:22.380 --> 03:11:24.460
I'm about to see your freaking feet on my...

03:11:24.460 --> 03:11:25.820
I swear if you are...

03:11:26.780 --> 03:11:28.620
And I open up this marshmallow.

03:11:28.620 --> 03:11:30.540
I'm not opening up marshmallows on stream again.

03:11:33.180 --> 03:11:34.300
Are you talking?

03:11:34.300 --> 03:11:35.820
No, he's just moving his feet.

03:11:35.820 --> 03:11:37.500
You're in your boxers!

03:11:38.220 --> 03:11:39.980
Okay, I didn't see a pizza.

03:11:39.980 --> 03:11:41.740
Wait, his feet are so pale.

03:11:41.740 --> 03:11:42.860
What the fuck?

03:11:42.860 --> 03:11:43.980
Why are they so pale?

03:11:43.980 --> 03:11:44.940
Why are you white?

03:11:46.540 --> 03:11:48.060
Okay, I think he's in his boxers.

03:11:48.060 --> 03:11:49.580
Wait, who's in their boxers?

03:11:49.580 --> 03:11:50.300
Hold on a minute.

03:11:50.300 --> 03:11:51.900
Are you all in your boxers right now?

03:11:52.540 --> 03:11:53.740
Hold on a minute.

03:11:54.700 --> 03:11:55.980
Wait a minute.

03:11:57.740 --> 03:11:58.620
Wait a minute.

03:12:00.940 --> 03:12:01.260
Who?

03:12:02.380 --> 03:12:04.540
Who's not wearing anything right now?

03:12:05.660 --> 03:12:07.100
She knows?

03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:08.540
I mean, it's easier access.

03:12:14.220 --> 03:12:15.820
Oh, you guys are wearing underwear.

03:12:16.540 --> 03:12:16.940
Nope.

03:12:16.940 --> 03:12:18.140
I'm in me joggers.

03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:19.740
Broom, broom.

03:12:20.780 --> 03:12:22.140
It's hot in here, okay?

03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:23.500
I'm in bed, so yeah, boxers.

03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:25.500
I'm wearing shorts.

03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:26.380
The socks count.

03:12:26.380 --> 03:12:27.580
You're only wearing socks?

03:12:27.580 --> 03:12:28.940
They don't look cold.

03:12:28.940 --> 03:12:30.540
I'm at work, fully clothed.

03:12:30.540 --> 03:12:31.660
Oh, are you at work?

03:12:32.300 --> 03:12:33.100
Ink yourself.

03:12:33.100 --> 03:12:33.420
No!

03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:35.980
No, don't, don't, don't, don't.

03:12:35.980 --> 03:12:36.540
You're at work.

03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:39.180
Pants to check.

03:12:39.180 --> 03:12:39.820
I'm a grown man.

03:12:39.820 --> 03:12:41.180
Why would I wear clothes on my own house?

03:12:41.180 --> 03:12:42.380
Real, real through.

03:12:42.940 --> 03:12:44.060
I don't have shit to do.

03:12:44.060 --> 03:12:44.700
So hot.

03:12:44.700 --> 03:12:46.220
Mmm, grab it up.

03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:47.180
Power word.

03:12:47.180 --> 03:12:47.580
Ink.

03:12:48.380 --> 03:12:50.860
Easier to keep the jewels at a proper temperature.

03:12:51.820 --> 03:12:53.180
Alone and naked.

03:12:55.180 --> 03:12:57.100
I'm always on the commando grind.

03:12:57.100 --> 03:13:00.220
Oh, you got the commando weapon on black ops?

03:13:00.220 --> 03:13:00.700
Real.

03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:03.180
Um.

03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:08.380
Mmm.

03:13:08.380 --> 03:13:10.060
Mummy, I'm nervous to say my age in chat,

03:13:10.060 --> 03:13:12.060
although other reasons have said theirs.

03:13:12.060 --> 03:13:15.100
But I'm 20 and yes, I'm letting you control my ink in America.

03:13:15.100 --> 03:13:16.620
Oh, you're letting an older woman.

03:13:17.180 --> 03:13:18.060
Call me a cougar.

03:13:19.020 --> 03:13:21.260
An older woman?

03:13:22.140 --> 03:13:23.260
Control your ink?

03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:30.140
I'm walking in public so sadly, I'm modestly just terrible.

03:13:30.140 --> 03:13:32.220
Caught me off guard, I'm wearing five pairs of pants.

03:13:32.220 --> 03:13:32.700
Got you!

03:13:33.260 --> 03:13:34.380
Got you in 4k.

03:13:34.380 --> 03:13:35.660
A onesie for real, for real.

03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:38.140
I've sucked on, does that count?

03:13:38.140 --> 03:13:38.620
Something.

03:13:39.340 --> 03:13:40.780
You spilled water on that bed.

03:13:41.660 --> 03:13:42.140
Bed?

03:13:42.780 --> 03:13:43.580
Who's bed?

03:13:43.580 --> 03:13:44.380
Who's bed?

03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:46.540
This is called floor.

03:13:47.500 --> 03:13:48.220
No bed here.

03:13:52.220 --> 03:13:53.580
Below 20 and 30.

03:13:53.580 --> 03:13:55.260
We're closing in on that real age boys.

03:13:55.260 --> 03:13:55.660
Ooh.

03:13:58.140 --> 03:14:00.220
Please do the foot cam script writing stream.

03:14:00.220 --> 03:14:03.180
I have a major fantasy of being used as a chair and a foot sill.

03:14:03.180 --> 03:14:03.420
Oh.

03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:09.260
So that's your thing.

03:14:09.260 --> 03:14:10.860
That's your special interest.

03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:12.220
Oh, and you ignore me.

03:14:12.220 --> 03:14:14.620
Just playing with that ball as you were yapping was killing me.

03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:16.060
I'm sure the other refunds would enjoy it too.

03:14:16.060 --> 03:14:16.620
Thank you, mommy.

03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:17.500
You're too good.

03:14:17.500 --> 03:14:20.380
Also CB, cognitive behavioural therapy is not punishment.

03:14:21.740 --> 03:14:22.300
Kinkling.

03:14:22.300 --> 03:14:24.060
More like you've got a name upgrade.

03:14:24.060 --> 03:14:24.940
You're called kinkling.

03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:26.780
Furnit year?

03:14:26.780 --> 03:14:27.740
You want to be furnit year?

03:14:31.180 --> 03:14:32.700
No bed, no hands for hanging.

03:14:32.700 --> 03:14:33.580
Life is a lie.

03:14:33.580 --> 03:14:35.500
What, you wanted my bed for the next one?

03:14:36.860 --> 03:14:40.700
I mean, if you want, I can bring a mattress through for the next hand cam stream.

03:14:40.700 --> 03:14:41.580
I don't see why not.

03:14:42.380 --> 03:14:43.900
I don't see why not.

03:14:43.900 --> 03:14:45.820
I can bring a mattress in if you want it.

03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:46.620
Like, sure.

03:14:46.620 --> 03:14:47.740
That's all you have to say.

03:14:49.020 --> 03:14:49.820
Do it.

03:14:49.820 --> 03:14:51.020
Treat me like an object.

03:14:51.020 --> 03:14:51.820
Fuck no.

03:14:51.820 --> 03:14:53.500
That's just vanilla stuff.

03:14:54.380 --> 03:14:55.500
I'm kink-shing.

03:14:57.980 --> 03:14:59.260
Older women are extremely hot.

03:14:59.260 --> 03:15:01.820
I'd assume it's the same for women when older men are hot.

03:15:03.340 --> 03:15:04.540
See, I go both ways.

03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:05.660
I'm like fucking everything.

03:15:05.660 --> 03:15:06.460
Gimme it all, please.

03:15:08.460 --> 03:15:09.260
As a lurk.

03:15:09.420 --> 03:15:10.380
As a lurk?

03:15:11.820 --> 03:15:12.380
Hi, strongy.

03:15:12.380 --> 03:15:14.460
All this lurker love is making me come out of the woodworks

03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:16.380
and I'm a major lurker who doesn't even talk and chat.

03:15:16.380 --> 03:15:17.580
Been lurking since debut.

03:15:17.580 --> 03:15:18.060
Oh, hi.

03:15:19.260 --> 03:15:22.540
We're almost at four months lurking on me from the shadows.

03:15:22.540 --> 03:15:23.260
But I see.

03:15:25.420 --> 03:15:27.020
And other girls, it's actually kind of bad

03:15:27.020 --> 03:15:29.180
because whenever I become a member, I did it

03:15:29.180 --> 03:15:31.420
when there was no stream, so you wouldn't read my name.

03:15:31.420 --> 03:15:35.340
Oh, but that's like the best part about like becoming a member

03:15:35.340 --> 03:15:37.420
because I'm not allowed to say your names in general.

03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:38.540
Because that's feature, but there,

03:15:38.540 --> 03:15:40.220
that's one of the unwritten VTuber rules,

03:15:40.220 --> 03:15:43.740
to wrap around back to the singing.

03:15:44.780 --> 03:15:46.220
That's like an unwritten VTuber rule.

03:15:46.220 --> 03:15:48.780
I don't say your names in general, like I could,

03:15:48.780 --> 03:15:51.100
but I don't because it's not possible.

03:15:51.100 --> 03:15:54.860
But when you tip or become a member or stream snipe,

03:15:54.860 --> 03:15:56.780
then that gives you the choice.

03:15:56.780 --> 03:15:59.420
Although I feel a bit rough about the stream snipe one

03:15:59.420 --> 03:16:01.180
because obviously for those who like to lurk,

03:16:01.180 --> 03:16:03.740
I'm worried that you feel left out

03:16:03.740 --> 03:16:05.580
because you don't want to show up on stream

03:16:05.580 --> 03:16:07.260
because you're self-conscious.

03:16:07.260 --> 03:16:10.620
But I'm hoping I can extract not only ink out of you

03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:11.820
but some confidence as well.

03:16:11.820 --> 03:16:13.500
So it would work out in the long run, you know?

03:16:15.020 --> 03:16:18.300
Momay, a birth ASMR that ends in the reveal of Jenta next year.

03:16:19.580 --> 03:16:21.180
I have no idea.

03:16:21.180 --> 03:16:22.300
Like a real ninja.

03:16:22.300 --> 03:16:23.020
That's okay.

03:16:23.900 --> 03:16:25.740
I never like when VTuber say my name.

03:16:25.740 --> 03:16:26.060
Why?

03:16:26.940 --> 03:16:28.460
Beat for free just like that.

03:16:28.460 --> 03:16:31.260
You're gonna love my monetization stream.

03:16:32.380 --> 03:16:32.700
Sir?

03:16:33.660 --> 03:16:33.980
Sir?

03:16:34.700 --> 03:16:36.700
There's a monetization stream

03:16:36.780 --> 03:16:38.700
with your name written on it on this channel.

03:16:38.700 --> 03:16:39.420
If you like VT.

03:16:40.860 --> 03:16:42.780
Isn't that just for money purposes?

03:16:42.780 --> 03:16:45.420
Like your only one worth can call your name if you pay me?

03:16:46.940 --> 03:16:47.420
No.

03:16:47.420 --> 03:16:49.660
Like if I start to try and say everyone's...

03:16:49.660 --> 03:16:51.820
So I used to do this thing where I say good morning,

03:16:51.820 --> 03:16:53.500
try and say everyone's name at roll call,

03:16:53.500 --> 03:16:55.260
but it's not possible.

03:16:55.260 --> 03:16:57.580
So I can only say it during the...

03:16:57.580 --> 03:16:59.980
It's not like fuck you pay me, I'll say your name.

03:16:59.980 --> 03:17:04.460
It's just like brain worms and all those issues that come up.

03:17:04.460 --> 03:17:05.900
Fin don't fuck off!

03:17:05.900 --> 03:17:06.220
No!

03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:08.380
Nope!

03:17:08.380 --> 03:17:08.940
I'm...

03:17:08.940 --> 03:17:09.420
Nope.

03:17:09.420 --> 03:17:10.540
We're not doing that.

03:17:10.540 --> 03:17:11.500
We're not doing that.

03:17:11.500 --> 03:17:12.300
You're done.

03:17:12.300 --> 03:17:12.940
You're done.

03:17:13.740 --> 03:17:14.620
You're done.

03:17:15.660 --> 03:17:16.300
You're done.

03:17:16.300 --> 03:17:16.940
We're not...

03:17:16.940 --> 03:17:19.660
We're not even touching that subject of our time football.

03:17:19.660 --> 03:17:22.300
Mummy, what are your any opinions about armpits?

03:17:22.940 --> 03:17:25.660
I think you should take a big inhale of mine,

03:17:25.660 --> 03:17:27.900
memorize the sin and ink.

03:17:27.900 --> 03:17:29.260
That's why I think about armpits.

03:17:29.420 --> 03:17:37.500
It would cause brain worms if someone doesn't get their name called out when they're doing a roll.

03:17:37.500 --> 03:17:39.420
Yeah, like I don't want brain worms either.

03:17:40.220 --> 03:17:40.940
Don't shoot me!

03:17:40.940 --> 03:17:42.060
I'm just a messenger!

03:17:42.060 --> 03:17:42.620
Reeflings!

03:17:42.620 --> 03:17:44.540
Twist that man's nipples right now.

03:17:44.540 --> 03:17:46.060
Getting up on that reefling right now.

03:17:46.060 --> 03:17:46.940
Show them...

03:17:46.940 --> 03:17:48.780
Show them what a real twisty is all about.

03:17:50.300 --> 03:17:52.060
Hi mummy, I'm also a denialing right now.

03:17:52.060 --> 03:17:53.660
Can I ask for some words of encouragement?

03:17:53.660 --> 03:17:54.940
I have until Saturday.

03:17:54.940 --> 03:17:55.980
When's Saturday?

03:17:55.980 --> 03:17:58.460
I'm on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

03:17:58.540 --> 03:17:59.180
What's that one?

03:17:59.180 --> 03:18:01.420
Two, three, four, five.

03:18:01.420 --> 03:18:02.700
Five more days, damn.

03:18:04.380 --> 03:18:05.740
Sucks the suck, damnit.

03:18:07.500 --> 03:18:09.420
Sucks the fucking suck.

03:18:11.900 --> 03:18:14.780
Watch Thephilipod dom here?

03:18:14.780 --> 03:18:15.660
I don't know, what would it...

03:18:16.300 --> 03:18:18.300
It's healthy to lose gums with ink every stream.

03:18:18.940 --> 03:18:20.300
I hope you find it.

03:18:20.300 --> 03:18:22.540
Thank you, Gura, for that hit joke.

03:18:22.540 --> 03:18:23.660
Yes, I will steal that.

03:18:26.140 --> 03:18:27.660
Denialing, what would you say to that?

03:18:27.660 --> 03:18:28.700
To encourage you?

03:18:29.740 --> 03:18:30.860
Don't think about it.

03:18:31.660 --> 03:18:33.180
But if you do think about it,

03:18:34.300 --> 03:18:38.380
make sure you think really deep and hard about it.

03:18:39.180 --> 03:18:45.420
Almost keep ramming the point over and over and over again in your head.

03:18:50.860 --> 03:18:52.700
Where did my desktop audio display?

03:18:52.700 --> 03:18:54.140
Something pleaded my desktop audio.

03:18:54.140 --> 03:18:54.940
I don't know what it was.

03:18:55.740 --> 03:18:58.060
Is someone streaming in the background?

03:19:05.660 --> 03:19:07.660
Hi, mommie, I'm usually too tired to send in texts.

03:19:07.660 --> 03:19:08.220
No, you don't have to.

03:19:08.220 --> 03:19:10.460
But whenever you make content specifically for yourself,

03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:11.740
I do like to send you something in return.

03:19:11.740 --> 03:19:13.580
So don't worry if it seems like you don't want to send stuff.

03:19:13.580 --> 03:19:15.340
I think most of us just wait for material.

03:19:15.340 --> 03:19:15.900
That's fair.

03:19:15.900 --> 03:19:16.540
No, that's true.

03:19:16.540 --> 03:19:17.180
No, that's true.

03:19:17.180 --> 03:19:17.740
That's true.

03:19:17.740 --> 03:19:18.540
That's definitely true.

03:19:18.540 --> 03:19:21.180
I've been just lacking and lacking, unfortunately.

03:19:21.420 --> 03:19:26.780
And that's like I fucked up when I made my Roblox account.

03:19:26.780 --> 03:19:28.220
Literally have my first surname.

03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:33.660
Yeah, definitely don't stream snipe if your legal name is on your social media.

03:19:34.380 --> 03:19:36.620
That goes for anyone else listening out there.

03:19:36.620 --> 03:19:39.340
Turn your name into 360 no scope now.

03:19:39.340 --> 03:19:42.860
Do not use your legal name on any stuff.

03:19:44.460 --> 03:19:45.580
Moment please.

03:19:45.580 --> 03:19:46.460
These songs are good.

03:19:46.460 --> 03:19:47.580
Hey, mommie, I need to go pee.

03:19:47.580 --> 03:19:48.940
Can you pause the game?

03:19:51.660 --> 03:19:53.820
I can't remember the VTuber's response to that.

03:19:53.820 --> 03:19:55.260
I think that's a VTuber's name.

03:19:56.060 --> 03:19:56.940
It's too late.

03:19:57.660 --> 03:19:58.460
It's too late.

03:20:00.380 --> 03:20:03.500
Just don't need the new honey you bought, you know.

03:20:03.500 --> 03:20:06.220
Can we do an ASMR stream where we send our names on Maro and VTuber?

03:20:07.180 --> 03:20:09.740
I did think about that for the Pokemon stream.

03:20:11.100 --> 03:20:14.140
I was trying to take the feedback I got from the drawing stream,

03:20:14.140 --> 03:20:16.860
the membership drawing one, where I gave him the gamer tag and stuff,

03:20:16.860 --> 03:20:19.180
but people didn't like it, so I'm a bit hesitant.

03:20:19.580 --> 03:20:24.700
Considering how you are advertised, I almost feel bad.

03:20:24.700 --> 03:20:25.420
I haven't inked to me.

03:20:25.420 --> 03:20:26.380
I just watched your streams.

03:20:27.500 --> 03:20:29.500
You've never inked to me once?

03:20:30.140 --> 03:20:31.260
Is it my accent?

03:20:35.100 --> 03:20:38.060
There's not one thing that's made you want to ink.

03:20:40.060 --> 03:20:41.740
I'm clearly failing my job.

03:20:43.260 --> 03:20:45.820
I'm clearly a failure as a succubus.

03:20:46.780 --> 03:20:47.980
No one?

03:20:47.980 --> 03:20:50.380
You gave mummy brain worms, literally.

03:20:50.380 --> 03:20:51.260
No one?

03:20:51.260 --> 03:20:54.060
I've not said one thing that's tickled your pickle pink

03:20:54.780 --> 03:20:56.700
until you stroke that shit raw.

03:20:57.660 --> 03:21:00.380
Until you couldn't feel your thighs anymore?

03:21:00.380 --> 03:21:02.460
What a failure of a fucking streamer I am.

03:21:02.460 --> 03:21:02.940
Goddamn.

03:21:03.980 --> 03:21:04.620
Sacrilege.

03:21:05.980 --> 03:21:08.460
Mummy needs your ink to survive.

03:21:08.460 --> 03:21:09.260
Girl, failure.

03:21:09.260 --> 03:21:10.140
I can't believe it.

03:21:10.140 --> 03:21:10.620
A face.

03:21:12.060 --> 03:21:13.340
He's just a holy knight.

03:21:13.340 --> 03:21:14.860
Don't take it personally.

03:21:16.540 --> 03:21:17.180
Goddamn.

03:21:18.860 --> 03:21:20.060
I'm the girl failure.

03:21:20.060 --> 03:21:22.860
I can't even live up to those fucking expectations.

03:21:22.860 --> 03:21:23.180
Shit.

03:21:27.260 --> 03:21:28.060
Shocking.

03:21:28.060 --> 03:21:28.380
Chong.

03:21:29.180 --> 03:21:31.740
If that made you mad, you're not gonna like what I have to say.

03:21:32.460 --> 03:21:33.420
No!

03:21:33.420 --> 03:21:34.300
Wait, really?

03:21:38.540 --> 03:21:38.860
Ah.

03:21:39.660 --> 03:21:40.780
Don't take it to heart.

03:21:41.340 --> 03:21:46.860
That fucking teasing game, that shit, the fuck?

03:21:51.180 --> 03:21:51.900
Oh, you can't do that.

03:21:52.940 --> 03:21:53.900
That's okay.

03:21:53.900 --> 03:21:56.460
Um, there's a time and a place for that.

03:21:56.460 --> 03:21:56.860
There it is.

03:21:57.900 --> 03:21:59.100
I know what it is.

03:21:59.100 --> 03:22:01.180
It's cause I'm not cute and funny, isn't it?

03:22:02.220 --> 03:22:03.820
It's cause I'm not cute and funny.

03:22:05.020 --> 03:22:06.300
You know what I think about that?

03:22:06.380 --> 03:22:19.500
You don't have to be scared, I want this, please, for me.

03:22:20.540 --> 03:22:21.020
That's it.

03:22:21.020 --> 03:22:22.700
It's cause you want cute and funny, but I'm down here.

03:22:22.700 --> 03:22:24.380
I'm all the way down here with my octaves.

03:22:24.940 --> 03:22:27.180
I'm chilling down here with my octaves, all right?

03:22:28.780 --> 03:22:30.620
Leave me and my deep voice alone.

03:22:30.620 --> 03:22:31.980
I know you like the cute and funny.

03:22:31.980 --> 03:22:32.540
I'm on to you.

03:22:32.540 --> 03:22:32.940
Which one?

03:22:32.940 --> 03:22:34.300
I don't think I've been again.

03:22:34.300 --> 03:22:35.020
No, I'm on to you.

03:22:37.020 --> 03:22:40.860
I sadly, I can't ink to you most of the time because of anti-depressants.

03:22:40.860 --> 03:22:41.980
Oh, no, keep doing that.

03:22:41.980 --> 03:22:42.460
Hold it.

03:22:42.460 --> 03:22:46.700
All memes aside, all memes aside, all memes aside.

03:22:47.660 --> 03:22:51.180
Do not stop taking, cause the thing about anti-depressants is

03:22:51.180 --> 03:22:53.020
they take so long to build up in your system

03:22:53.020 --> 03:22:55.900
if you stop taking them purely for the purpose of inking.

03:22:57.340 --> 03:22:58.220
No, thank you.

03:22:59.820 --> 03:23:00.940
Lollipops running.

03:23:02.140 --> 03:23:02.860
Cunning cull.

03:23:04.060 --> 03:23:04.620
Okay.

03:23:04.620 --> 03:23:05.260
Hi, Yumi.

03:23:05.260 --> 03:23:05.740
How's it going?

03:23:07.180 --> 03:23:07.980
Cunning cull.

03:23:09.740 --> 03:23:10.380
Fuck.

03:23:10.380 --> 03:23:11.100
That's kind of good.

03:23:12.460 --> 03:23:13.980
You like the dummy mommy voice?

03:23:13.980 --> 03:23:14.300
What?

03:23:14.300 --> 03:23:16.700
You mean you don't like the Ash Ketchum voice?

03:23:18.140 --> 03:23:18.620
Ash.

03:23:19.980 --> 03:23:21.420
I'm Ash Ketchum.

03:23:21.420 --> 03:23:23.260
What do you mean you don't like my voice?

03:23:24.540 --> 03:23:26.140
Um, you got class then?

03:23:26.140 --> 03:23:27.500
Oh my god, you're in education?

03:23:27.500 --> 03:23:28.300
How young?

03:23:28.300 --> 03:23:29.500
Are you over 18?

03:23:29.500 --> 03:23:31.340
I don't call out for people that are under 18.

03:23:34.540 --> 03:23:35.020
Are you an-

03:23:35.980 --> 03:23:36.460
Okay.

03:23:37.260 --> 03:23:37.900
Monka is.

03:23:38.780 --> 03:23:39.900
Please enjoy your class.

03:23:39.900 --> 03:23:40.380
Goddamn.

03:23:41.900 --> 03:23:43.020
What's the name plus twi-

03:23:43.020 --> 03:23:44.540
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:23:44.540 --> 03:23:45.820
You had me stressed in there.

03:23:45.820 --> 03:23:47.660
I was like, you fucking middle school?

03:23:47.660 --> 03:23:49.580
Why are you talking to me?

03:23:49.580 --> 03:23:51.020
Why are you making content?

03:23:53.180 --> 03:23:54.300
Change her back.

03:23:54.300 --> 03:23:56.460
I want that voice that sounds like she's telling me all.

03:23:57.660 --> 03:23:58.460
Oh, this one.

03:23:58.460 --> 03:23:59.020
Right, okay.

03:23:59.660 --> 03:24:00.780
It's Ash Ketchum.

03:24:00.780 --> 03:24:01.580
Holy smokes.

03:24:02.460 --> 03:24:03.260
I don't know what-

03:24:03.420 --> 03:24:06.140
I don't know what American ranking system is.

03:24:06.140 --> 03:24:09.660
Is middle school not like when you're 12 or something?

03:24:09.660 --> 03:24:10.540
I have no idea.

03:24:11.500 --> 03:24:12.780
University is a thing?

03:24:13.820 --> 03:24:17.980
Well, it could use me for being uneducated

03:24:17.980 --> 03:24:19.900
and not understanding the basic age ranges

03:24:19.900 --> 03:24:21.820
of those who go into further education.

03:24:22.940 --> 03:24:24.140
It could be at university.

03:24:24.940 --> 03:24:26.780
College students can be 18 or 19.

03:24:26.780 --> 03:24:29.180
Funny to put her on her toes though.

03:24:30.140 --> 03:24:32.780
Did you just make a pun?

03:24:33.660 --> 03:24:38.460
I hear, I hear, I hear.

03:24:38.460 --> 03:24:40.860
You me said she put me on my toes.

03:24:42.220 --> 03:24:43.420
This is my perfect team.

03:24:44.460 --> 03:24:45.980
I don't like the toes pointing at-

03:24:45.980 --> 03:24:47.900
Well, you don't have dexterity in your toes?

03:24:48.780 --> 03:24:50.620
Like, can you not move them around

03:24:50.620 --> 03:24:52.140
and do what you want with them?

03:24:52.140 --> 03:24:53.100
I didn't mean to.

03:24:53.100 --> 03:24:53.660
Oh my God.

03:24:53.660 --> 03:24:54.860
Well, it was bloody good either way.

03:24:58.620 --> 03:24:59.500
Nicely said.

03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:00.620
I don't mind Ash Ketchum.

03:25:00.620 --> 03:25:02.300
I have specific things though.

03:25:03.180 --> 03:25:03.660
What?

03:25:03.660 --> 03:25:05.980
You'd prefer Jesse instead?

03:25:07.340 --> 03:25:09.500
What's the wrong briefling?

03:25:09.500 --> 03:25:12.460
You don't like when mommy sounds like a Pokemon character?

03:25:13.340 --> 03:25:14.380
Oh dear.

03:25:17.580 --> 03:25:19.260
How you like that, boys?

03:25:20.220 --> 03:25:21.900
Strony's toes are very powerful.

03:25:21.900 --> 03:25:22.780
Can you do James?

03:25:23.900 --> 03:25:24.940
Me off this right-

03:25:24.940 --> 03:25:25.580
Wait, James.

03:25:26.860 --> 03:25:29.180
To protect the world from devastation.

03:25:29.180 --> 03:25:30.060
I can't go that deep.

03:25:31.020 --> 03:25:32.140
I can't go that deep.

03:25:32.140 --> 03:25:32.780
Ma'am, please.

03:25:32.780 --> 03:25:33.420
I'm in the kitchen.

03:25:33.420 --> 03:25:34.540
Try and make dinner.

03:25:34.540 --> 03:25:35.340
What's wrong?

03:25:36.060 --> 03:25:39.260
Are you imagining me coming from behind you?

03:25:39.260 --> 03:25:39.900
No.

03:25:39.900 --> 03:25:41.420
Keep doing what you're doing.

03:25:41.420 --> 03:25:44.620
I'm just going to stay behind you.

03:25:44.620 --> 03:25:46.620
Press the real class in the kitchen.

03:25:48.220 --> 03:25:49.900
James is higher than Jesse.

03:25:49.900 --> 03:25:50.540
Wait, walk.

03:25:51.820 --> 03:25:53.580
Protect the world from devastation.

03:25:54.460 --> 03:25:56.700
To protect the world from devastation.

03:25:58.140 --> 03:25:59.340
Me off this right?

03:25:59.340 --> 03:26:00.780
Uh, I kind of fucking do.

03:26:02.780 --> 03:26:03.740
Protect the world.

03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:05.500
Protect the world.

03:26:06.540 --> 03:26:08.780
Protect the world from devastation.

03:26:08.780 --> 03:26:09.580
Wait, no.

03:26:11.740 --> 03:26:12.940
James, how?

03:26:12.940 --> 03:26:13.580
I'm okay.

03:26:14.620 --> 03:26:15.740
Please, I'm trying to click in.

03:26:15.740 --> 03:26:17.740
Can you go ara ara?

03:26:17.740 --> 03:26:21.180
Ara ara, and then in Jesse's voice.

03:26:21.180 --> 03:26:22.220
Ara ara.

03:26:24.140 --> 03:26:26.860
Have you been a good boy, little briefling?

03:26:27.820 --> 03:26:33.340
Have you been making sure that mommy has perfect access to you?

03:26:37.020 --> 03:26:41.020
Did you know if you stick your feet out from the blanket,

03:26:41.020 --> 03:26:43.180
mommy's going to visit to talk you in?

03:26:45.660 --> 03:26:48.780
The trolling James voice is our register's more than this one.

03:26:48.780 --> 03:26:49.740
This is kind of thing.

03:26:51.100 --> 03:26:52.220
How do you do it Valley though?

03:26:53.980 --> 03:26:56.380
Oh my god, are you me?

03:26:56.860 --> 03:26:59.420
It's been so long.

03:27:00.620 --> 03:27:01.340
That's the best.

03:27:01.340 --> 03:27:02.220
I go up right here.

03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:07.420
That triggered my swallow reflex.

03:27:07.420 --> 03:27:09.180
I'm playing a game of women's chills.

03:27:10.140 --> 03:27:11.020
Young world craft.

03:27:12.220 --> 03:27:13.580
Woman mathematical stood up.

03:27:13.580 --> 03:27:16.300
Up two, three forward, up two, three forward.

03:27:17.260 --> 03:27:18.620
It's been way too long.

03:27:18.620 --> 03:27:23.420
We should like honestly catch the fuck up like seriously.

03:27:24.060 --> 03:27:27.580
What? Why are you calling me a bimbo?

03:27:28.380 --> 03:27:29.420
What are you talking about?

03:27:29.420 --> 03:27:30.860
What does that word even mean?

03:27:31.740 --> 03:27:33.660
You're so funny, briefling.

03:27:33.660 --> 03:27:36.380
I like when you give me that expression on your face

03:27:36.380 --> 03:27:37.660
like you're pitying me.

03:27:39.500 --> 03:27:39.980
I don't know.

03:27:40.780 --> 03:27:41.740
That's a car.

03:27:41.740 --> 03:27:42.220
Sorry.

03:27:43.100 --> 03:27:43.740
I'm sorry.

03:27:43.740 --> 03:27:45.980
I'm gonna imagine saying what?

03:27:47.820 --> 03:27:48.700
No, I'm not a good boy.

03:27:48.700 --> 03:27:51.980
In fact, I'm actually a bad boy that I became a woman.

03:27:51.980 --> 03:27:52.540
What?

03:27:52.620 --> 03:27:53.740
That's not every one.

03:27:54.460 --> 03:27:55.900
Gayru voice on top.

03:27:56.940 --> 03:27:59.260
Fifth, fifth gal in law.

03:28:00.060 --> 03:28:01.260
Bimbos have big boobs.

03:28:05.340 --> 03:28:06.300
I'm speechless.

03:28:06.300 --> 03:28:07.740
I don't know what to say to that.

03:28:07.740 --> 03:28:11.580
Um, you got me there.

03:28:13.260 --> 03:28:14.380
You got me there.

03:28:14.380 --> 03:28:15.660
I'm not gonna lie.

03:28:15.660 --> 03:28:16.780
Fuck, I have no comeback.

03:28:17.500 --> 03:28:24.540
Yeah, okay, I got to tip for that Jesse Aruara.

03:28:24.540 --> 03:28:25.580
Pure gold.

03:28:25.580 --> 03:28:26.380
I lost.

03:28:26.380 --> 03:28:27.980
Oh, you liked it.

03:28:27.980 --> 03:28:28.380
Thank you.

03:28:30.620 --> 03:28:31.740
Literally I paused.

03:28:31.740 --> 03:28:33.900
I was like, there's no recovery from that one.

03:28:33.900 --> 03:28:36.940
Oh, I was like, oh, I can do this and this and this.

03:28:36.940 --> 03:28:39.100
And I was like, well, actually the webcam's on right now.

03:28:39.100 --> 03:28:41.420
If I go sideways, you're gonna see through me.

03:28:41.420 --> 03:28:43.260
Um, so not as much as that happens.

03:28:44.220 --> 03:28:45.500
Are you squinting me right now?

03:28:45.500 --> 03:28:46.620
Mio's Oro Oro.

03:28:47.260 --> 03:28:49.500
Strani is one of my favorite streamers.

03:28:49.500 --> 03:28:49.900
Oh, yeah?

03:28:49.900 --> 03:28:52.860
Thankfully, she doesn't know who I am since this is my out.

03:28:53.740 --> 03:28:55.740
Gura Gura channel.in.

03:28:55.740 --> 03:28:56.940
Okay, dude.

03:28:56.940 --> 03:28:58.300
Thank you for the tip.

03:28:59.500 --> 03:29:01.660
Gura, we love you, Gura.

03:29:01.660 --> 03:29:03.100
I can't wait for your next thing.

03:29:03.740 --> 03:29:06.060
I love your, your bucket, Callan.

03:29:06.060 --> 03:29:08.780
Your gallon bucket of a comment.

03:29:08.780 --> 03:29:09.580
That was really funny.

03:29:09.580 --> 03:29:10.300
Peace.

03:29:10.300 --> 03:29:12.860
I don't know how she can think on her feet like that.

03:29:12.860 --> 03:29:13.340
Yeah.

03:29:13.340 --> 03:29:16.380
I don't know how Gura could think so fast on her feet like that.

03:29:16.380 --> 03:29:18.220
I don't get it because I'm just asking.

03:29:19.500 --> 03:29:22.460
Um, I don't know how she did that, honestly.

03:29:24.060 --> 03:29:25.420
I've lost gallons to you.

03:29:26.060 --> 03:29:27.340
I've lost gallons to you.

03:29:28.060 --> 03:29:29.260
I hope you can go find it.

03:29:33.580 --> 03:29:34.300
Gura's real.

03:29:35.020 --> 03:29:35.900
She's a real good book.

03:29:36.700 --> 03:29:38.060
Why is that whenever I come at hand?

03:29:38.060 --> 03:29:39.740
I'm streaming my feet.

03:29:39.740 --> 03:29:41.260
Honestly, you got me there.

03:29:41.260 --> 03:29:42.140
Wrap it up.

03:29:42.140 --> 03:29:42.780
Wrap it up.

03:29:42.780 --> 03:29:43.820
The reefling called me out.

03:29:43.820 --> 03:29:44.860
No, he's got a point.

03:29:44.860 --> 03:29:45.500
Nope.

03:29:45.500 --> 03:29:45.980
Hold on.

03:29:45.980 --> 03:29:46.540
Let him speak.

03:29:46.540 --> 03:29:47.340
He's got a point.

03:29:48.460 --> 03:29:48.780
Um,

03:29:53.980 --> 03:29:55.180
they're trying not like bimbos.

03:29:55.180 --> 03:29:56.380
No, I'm flat-chested.

03:29:56.380 --> 03:29:58.380
You may, you may.

03:29:58.380 --> 03:30:00.380
There's no other way to explain this.

03:30:00.380 --> 03:30:01.260
I am Patan.

03:30:02.460 --> 03:30:06.940
Um, I have the smallest as well of all my gen mates.

03:30:06.940 --> 03:30:08.460
Um, I am flat-chested.

03:30:09.180 --> 03:30:13.180
No more feet on hand count streams?

03:30:17.980 --> 03:30:19.180
Why are you lying?

03:30:19.900 --> 03:30:20.380
I mean,

03:30:22.460 --> 03:30:22.860
I mean,

03:30:32.140 --> 03:30:33.180
that's all you're getting.

03:30:34.220 --> 03:30:36.140
Do you see head straight down this way?

03:30:36.140 --> 03:30:37.340
There's nothing going on.

03:30:39.420 --> 03:30:41.420
There's just little hills.

03:30:42.700 --> 03:30:44.220
There's tiny little hills.

03:30:44.220 --> 03:30:45.180
We're just chilling.

03:30:46.140 --> 03:30:47.180
Chilling like a villain.

03:30:47.980 --> 03:30:49.980
No, there's a little bit.

03:30:51.980 --> 03:30:52.780
The hips coming.

03:30:54.620 --> 03:30:55.420
A little bit.

03:30:55.420 --> 03:30:57.100
I don't want to mess with the way I've come too much.

03:30:57.100 --> 03:30:58.300
What time is it now?

03:30:59.660 --> 03:30:59.980
Sorry.

03:31:02.620 --> 03:31:02.860
Um,

03:31:04.060 --> 03:31:05.340
Sheevee's boobs reattached.

03:31:05.340 --> 03:31:07.740
Someone made a meme of Sheevee giving me her boobs

03:31:07.740 --> 03:31:09.580
and I was like, who do you think ticked your boobs?

03:31:09.580 --> 03:31:10.860
Stranny nose!

03:31:14.060 --> 03:31:15.260
Are you squiddin' me right now?

03:31:15.260 --> 03:31:16.860
Don't able to firmly grasp them.

03:31:16.860 --> 03:31:19.660
Well, remember I do have a bra that's shaping them on,

03:31:19.660 --> 03:31:20.380
by the way.

03:31:20.380 --> 03:31:21.500
I have terrible news.

03:31:21.500 --> 03:31:24.060
Thank you to Puckle Nation for the extended membership.

03:31:25.660 --> 03:31:26.300
And the support.

03:31:27.020 --> 03:31:29.420
I hope you enjoy your emotes.

03:31:29.420 --> 03:31:30.460
They're soon coming.

03:31:30.460 --> 03:31:30.940
20m.

03:31:31.980 --> 03:31:33.340
Rip that shit off!

03:31:33.340 --> 03:31:33.980
Free the boob.

03:31:35.580 --> 03:31:36.940
I don't see any problems here.

03:31:37.820 --> 03:31:38.300
Okay.

03:31:39.660 --> 03:31:40.380
Don't say sorry.

03:31:40.380 --> 03:31:40.940
I didn't mean it.

03:31:40.940 --> 03:31:41.580
Oh, no, no, no.

03:31:41.580 --> 03:31:42.300
Don't worry.

03:31:42.300 --> 03:31:43.420
We're just teasing.

03:31:43.420 --> 03:31:43.980
Don't worry.

03:31:43.980 --> 03:31:44.620
I'm teasing.

03:31:45.340 --> 03:31:47.660
I'm teasing for a please and please don't overthink.

03:31:47.660 --> 03:31:49.980
When you talk to me, you're wearing a brate.

03:31:49.980 --> 03:31:51.100
Blasphemous.

03:31:51.100 --> 03:31:51.580
I know.

03:31:51.580 --> 03:31:52.220
Well, that's true.

03:31:52.220 --> 03:31:54.540
If you're wearing a hammock and you said you were wearing a,

03:31:54.540 --> 03:31:55.500
your boxerino.

03:31:55.500 --> 03:31:56.540
So you're wearing a hammock.

03:31:58.940 --> 03:31:59.740
Hi, mommy's feet.

03:32:00.700 --> 03:32:02.300
Hello, Riefling.

03:32:02.300 --> 03:32:03.340
It's nice to see you.

03:32:04.380 --> 03:32:05.900
I'm talking to you through my feet.

03:32:06.700 --> 03:32:07.180
Ta-da.

03:32:08.060 --> 03:32:09.740
Sorry, I'm an innocent asylum right now.

03:32:10.620 --> 03:32:13.580
Due to the fact that you can see my under feet.

03:32:14.780 --> 03:32:16.380
To support what breast.

03:32:16.380 --> 03:32:17.500
Right, steady on.

03:32:17.500 --> 03:32:17.900
Right.

03:32:17.900 --> 03:32:22.780
If there was no mild support, they'd start sagging and shit.

03:32:22.780 --> 03:32:23.420
I don't know.

03:32:23.420 --> 03:32:24.540
I don't know how science works.

03:32:28.620 --> 03:32:32.860
Would you say it's not fair that guys can show their bitboops and women?

03:32:32.860 --> 03:32:34.780
Oh, I get scared of men.

03:32:35.740 --> 03:32:41.180
Like, whenever I watch a movie or a TV show and then that guy takes his shirt off,

03:32:41.180 --> 03:32:43.020
I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, right.

03:32:43.020 --> 03:32:43.260
Okay.

03:32:43.900 --> 03:32:47.100
Cause like, cause you're not allowed to see him another way, you know.

03:32:49.100 --> 03:32:50.780
It's not expecting the ball squish.

03:32:50.780 --> 03:32:51.900
Oh, I'm just having a bit.

03:32:51.900 --> 03:32:54.460
I'm not, I'm just, I'm stimming on the ball right now.

03:32:54.460 --> 03:32:55.900
I'm stimming so hard on your ball.

03:32:57.900 --> 03:32:59.420
What do you feel about tattoos?

03:32:59.420 --> 03:33:00.460
Knock yourself out.

03:33:00.460 --> 03:33:02.620
Unfortunately, my mom instilled in shala.

03:33:02.620 --> 03:33:03.740
She's instilled in me.

03:33:03.740 --> 03:33:04.780
Didn't have any tattoos.

03:33:05.500 --> 03:33:08.620
And I'm allowed piercings where they're not, well, I'm allowed.

03:33:08.620 --> 03:33:10.940
I am an adult now, but when I was growing up,

03:33:10.940 --> 03:33:13.580
I had an interest in getting like a tongue piercing and stuff.

03:33:15.260 --> 03:33:18.860
But she said, don't get piercings where people can see them.

03:33:20.860 --> 03:33:23.420
And I took that literally and I got my angel wings.

03:33:23.420 --> 03:33:28.460
Um, yeah.

03:33:31.580 --> 03:33:34.300
The sad ball, my single ball.

03:33:37.260 --> 03:33:38.620
She's still one of those strong.

03:33:40.140 --> 03:33:42.300
Making me hungry and hatred.

03:33:42.300 --> 03:33:44.460
I want a neck tattoo, but that would kill my job.

03:33:44.460 --> 03:33:46.060
Yeah, I'm gonna have to.

03:33:46.060 --> 03:33:48.140
I'm afraid the world hasn't quite evolved past.

03:33:48.140 --> 03:33:48.620
Oh my God.

03:33:48.620 --> 03:33:48.860
Inc.

03:33:49.500 --> 03:33:53.020
Now as much as the angel wings, um, yeah.

03:33:54.140 --> 03:33:54.940
You hold on.

03:33:54.940 --> 03:33:55.500
Let me, uh,

03:33:58.380 --> 03:33:59.580
approve just a minute.

03:33:59.580 --> 03:34:01.180
And you know what this is?

03:34:02.620 --> 03:34:04.060
This is an angel wing.

03:34:05.740 --> 03:34:06.860
This was in me.

03:34:06.860 --> 03:34:08.140
It's no longer in me.

03:34:09.020 --> 03:34:11.100
It was stolen from me by a shower.

03:34:13.020 --> 03:34:16.780
That used to be a part of me, but unfortunately that ship

03:34:16.780 --> 03:34:17.180
has sailed.

03:34:17.180 --> 03:34:18.540
And no, I'm not gonna re-pierced.

03:34:19.180 --> 03:34:20.620
You just have it.

03:34:20.620 --> 03:34:22.620
Yeah, it ripped out like a month ago.

03:34:24.300 --> 03:34:29.260
I, it tore off out of me, like out of my personal body.

03:34:29.980 --> 03:34:30.780
It went, wee.

03:34:31.820 --> 03:34:32.780
It was painful.

03:34:32.780 --> 03:34:35.660
Yes, before you ask, it was excruciatingly painful, but

03:34:36.700 --> 03:34:38.860
will we take out the other for symmetry?

03:34:38.860 --> 03:34:41.020
Oh, I'm keeping it for now.

03:34:43.020 --> 03:34:46.460
Um, did the nip rip off?

03:34:46.460 --> 03:34:47.500
It reattached.

03:34:47.500 --> 03:34:49.980
Um, because of the blood flow around the area,

03:34:49.980 --> 03:34:51.980
um, it healed incredibly quickly,

03:34:51.980 --> 03:34:54.300
which I kind of suspect.

03:34:54.300 --> 03:34:57.420
But I'm a one-winged angel,

03:34:57.420 --> 03:34:59.500
so I can kind of fly just a little bit,

03:34:59.500 --> 03:35:00.940
not too much, but I can fly a little bit.

03:35:01.980 --> 03:35:03.100
And you should take the other one out,

03:35:03.100 --> 03:35:04.860
so you don't rip that one as well.

03:35:04.860 --> 03:35:06.540
But because I only have one now,

03:35:06.540 --> 03:35:09.420
my brain registers that I got only have one,

03:35:09.420 --> 03:35:10.460
and I need to be careful.

03:35:12.620 --> 03:35:16.140
She almost had a gripper nipple on her body.

03:35:16.140 --> 03:35:17.100
What does that mean?

03:35:17.820 --> 03:35:19.020
Oh, like, okay.

03:35:19.980 --> 03:35:21.900
Shawnee, you need me to kiss it better.

03:35:21.900 --> 03:35:22.940
Mmm.

03:35:22.940 --> 03:35:24.700
But yeah, it's fine, honestly, it's fine.

03:35:26.860 --> 03:35:27.900
Sephora?

03:35:28.780 --> 03:35:29.100
What?

03:35:29.900 --> 03:35:30.860
Sephora?

03:35:30.860 --> 03:35:31.500
Evil?

03:35:32.380 --> 03:35:34.140
Wait, you've both made a reference to this.

03:35:34.140 --> 03:35:34.780
What is this?

03:35:35.500 --> 03:35:36.540
What's Sephora?

03:35:40.940 --> 03:35:41.580
What?

03:35:41.580 --> 03:35:44.860
Is it Final Fantasy?

03:35:44.860 --> 03:35:47.260
Oh, I've not played Final Fantasy, my apologies.

03:35:47.900 --> 03:35:50.540
I thought Goofy was in Final Fantasy or something like that.

03:35:52.220 --> 03:35:54.300
Sorry, I've not played Final Fantasy,

03:35:54.300 --> 03:35:55.340
I've not played any of it.

03:35:55.340 --> 03:35:57.020
Forgive me, okay, fake gamer,

03:35:57.020 --> 03:35:58.220
only do it for male attention.

03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:00.060
Sephora?

03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:02.060
I've never seen the name before!

03:36:02.060 --> 03:36:03.180
Stop typing names!

03:36:03.980 --> 03:36:05.180
Like, you can't even be like,

03:36:05.180 --> 03:36:06.540
oh, she said it wrong.

03:36:08.220 --> 03:36:09.980
Goofy is in Kingdom Hearts.

03:36:09.980 --> 03:36:11.100
Wait, what?

03:36:11.100 --> 03:36:13.420
Oh, wait, I'm getting Final Fantasy

03:36:13.420 --> 03:36:14.860
in Kingdom's Heart messed up.

03:36:14.860 --> 03:36:16.780
Sorry, I've not played either before you ask.

03:36:17.820 --> 03:36:19.260
Sephora, right.

03:36:21.420 --> 03:36:22.780
You've got Kingdom Hearts sometimes.

03:36:22.780 --> 03:36:25.420
I'm sorry, like, they look the same or something,

03:36:25.420 --> 03:36:25.980
I don't know.

03:36:25.980 --> 03:36:27.820
I ain't played the genres yet.

03:36:27.820 --> 03:36:29.420
I ain't played the genres yet.

03:36:31.260 --> 03:36:32.700
The One-Winged Angel,

03:36:32.700 --> 03:36:34.140
because you'll never guess what he is.

03:36:35.260 --> 03:36:35.740
Cuddles?

03:36:35.740 --> 03:36:37.100
I want to give you a womb tattoo,

03:36:37.100 --> 03:36:38.220
but instead of a traditional one,

03:36:38.220 --> 03:36:40.300
I want you to put my name on it

03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:41.900
to show that you're my best friend.

03:36:41.900 --> 03:36:43.020
Breeding pot, what the?

03:36:44.700 --> 03:36:46.220
I don't think I should have read that one out loud.

03:36:47.180 --> 03:36:47.580
Hmm.

03:36:49.260 --> 03:36:49.580
Hmm.

03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:51.820
Your technical type though.

03:36:52.620 --> 03:36:53.180
Be honest.

03:36:55.260 --> 03:36:56.460
I can't ink to you if you don't know

03:36:56.460 --> 03:36:57.740
the Final Fantasy lore.

03:36:59.020 --> 03:37:00.300
He did read that one out there.

03:37:01.980 --> 03:37:04.380
Wait, I have to learn Final Fantasy lore?

03:37:04.380 --> 03:37:04.860
Right.

03:37:04.860 --> 03:37:06.940
Well, I'm Sephiroth, okay?

03:37:06.940 --> 03:37:07.820
So, there you go.

03:37:07.820 --> 03:37:09.500
How much more lore do you need

03:37:09.500 --> 03:37:10.860
before you can base?

03:37:10.860 --> 03:37:11.420
And base?

03:37:13.580 --> 03:37:15.180
You're getting male attention and refling.

03:37:15.180 --> 03:37:16.140
Ink mixed up?

03:37:16.140 --> 03:37:16.620
I know.

03:37:17.500 --> 03:37:19.260
Her internal thoughts are full of like,

03:37:19.900 --> 03:37:20.940
more sane refling.

03:37:22.620 --> 03:37:23.020
It's like,

03:37:23.740 --> 03:37:26.220
it's like Dresda, but a femboy?

03:37:26.940 --> 03:37:27.420
What?

03:37:28.300 --> 03:37:29.260
Have we got femboy?

03:37:29.260 --> 03:37:30.540
Are we fighting more femboys?

03:37:30.540 --> 03:37:32.460
We just bought one in Elden Ring there.

03:37:33.740 --> 03:37:34.620
Hmm.

03:37:34.620 --> 03:37:35.820
That's pretty fucking hot.

03:37:35.820 --> 03:37:37.180
I'm a little reminded though.

03:37:38.700 --> 03:37:41.100
Eh, not sure if message got filtered.

03:37:41.100 --> 03:37:42.380
Sorry if it's a repair.

03:37:42.380 --> 03:37:44.700
Insert glasses, copy past that mummy.

03:37:44.700 --> 03:37:46.300
I have a thing for nerdy girls with glasses.

03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:47.100
Since you have glasses,

03:37:47.100 --> 03:37:48.460
can you pin some on your model?

03:37:49.100 --> 03:37:49.740
Just for fun.

03:37:49.740 --> 03:37:51.580
Can you pull and see the reasons why you look like that?

03:37:53.100 --> 03:37:53.580
Oh no!

03:37:57.180 --> 03:37:57.580
Yeah.

03:38:06.540 --> 03:38:07.340
Reeflin.

03:38:09.900 --> 03:38:10.860
A reeflin.

03:38:10.860 --> 03:38:12.860
Are you fucking Gamblin?

03:38:14.940 --> 03:38:18.220
I mean, I'll give it a like and a heart,

03:38:18.220 --> 03:38:20.380
but don't fucking Gamba.

03:38:20.380 --> 03:38:20.860
Doin'.

03:38:22.940 --> 03:38:25.980
I just gambled on Pokemon cards and look what I get.

03:38:26.620 --> 03:38:29.580
Energies and repeats for a century.

03:38:29.580 --> 03:38:31.100
Wait, you can't see that tile there.

03:38:31.100 --> 03:38:32.380
Hold on, I'm bringing it up.

03:38:32.380 --> 03:38:34.060
Literally, look all these repeats.

03:38:34.060 --> 03:38:35.820
Repeats, repeats, repeats.

03:38:35.820 --> 03:38:37.100
Some of them I had multiple.

03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:38.460
They showed up more than once.

03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:40.300
Like, you're Gamblin?

03:38:41.180 --> 03:38:42.460
This is a job.

03:38:42.540 --> 03:38:45.100
You're gonna lose, the house always wins.

03:38:45.100 --> 03:38:48.140
Like, literally, I just had to work with Gamblin.

03:38:48.140 --> 03:38:49.580
If you ignore the specials,

03:38:49.580 --> 03:38:51.740
but the specials were guaranteed anyway,

03:38:52.620 --> 03:38:53.820
you just touch them with your feet,

03:38:53.820 --> 03:38:56.380
you gain 100% more value at once.

03:38:58.300 --> 03:38:59.500
Gamblin for fun is fine,

03:38:59.500 --> 03:39:01.900
but throwing money at it is expensive all day.

03:39:01.900 --> 03:39:03.900
That's not Gamblin, that's RNG on the pack.

03:39:03.900 --> 03:39:05.020
Gamblin is more Gamblin.

03:39:06.540 --> 03:39:07.900
No more Gamblin, I'm having this.

03:39:07.900 --> 03:39:09.180
What if I'm the house?

03:39:09.180 --> 03:39:11.340
Get it twisted, you will win big.

03:39:11.340 --> 03:39:13.500
Whoa, that is a reference

03:39:13.500 --> 03:39:15.100
to hardly anyone's gonna get.

03:39:16.220 --> 03:39:17.580
Get it twisted.

03:39:18.540 --> 03:39:20.460
Wow, that's a good reference.

03:39:20.460 --> 03:39:21.900
I don't like Coke.

03:39:21.900 --> 03:39:23.580
I don't do Coke, I drink Coke.

03:39:24.780 --> 03:39:26.860
He has luck from strongy believing him.

03:39:28.220 --> 03:39:30.300
Someone please fall out New Vega.

03:39:32.940 --> 03:39:33.740
What, Gamble?

03:39:33.740 --> 03:39:35.340
You can Gamble and fall out New Vega?

03:39:35.340 --> 03:39:37.260
Oh, Gamblers stop when they're about to win big.

03:39:37.260 --> 03:39:41.260
So yeah, you're gonna turn the reflins into addicts.

03:39:42.300 --> 03:39:42.620
Yeah.

03:39:46.220 --> 03:39:47.020
Mm-hmm.

03:39:47.020 --> 03:39:48.060
Let's go Gamblin.

03:39:49.180 --> 03:39:49.820
Aw, dang it.

03:39:50.380 --> 03:39:51.900
Mummy dad permission to go pee?

03:39:53.340 --> 03:39:54.860
No, hold it for five minutes.

03:39:55.820 --> 03:39:57.820
What, you can't last another five minutes?

03:39:58.540 --> 03:39:58.860
Really?

03:39:59.660 --> 03:40:00.940
Hold it for five minutes.

03:40:00.940 --> 03:40:02.780
You can stay a little time on your phone, it's fine.

03:40:03.580 --> 03:40:04.780
If you're gonna ask for permission,

03:40:04.780 --> 03:40:05.740
you're gonna have to wait.

03:40:06.460 --> 03:40:10.620
Uh, Mummy, I really appreciate how you make time for us,

03:40:10.620 --> 03:40:11.660
even when you should be working.

03:40:11.660 --> 03:40:12.620
Even if it's procrastination,

03:40:12.620 --> 03:40:16.140
glad we entertain and give you back a little bit of what you just said.

03:40:16.140 --> 03:40:19.660
No, that's what I was trying to say before I got distracted.

03:40:19.660 --> 03:40:23.100
Imagine helping strongy by giving her 100k for the tip.

03:40:23.100 --> 03:40:26.300
No, don't give me that kind of money, are you stone?

03:40:26.300 --> 03:40:28.780
I wouldn't even know what to do with it.

03:40:28.780 --> 03:40:30.620
Typical nation, thank you for the tip.

03:40:30.620 --> 03:40:33.100
No, don't give me this kind of money.

03:40:33.900 --> 03:40:38.780
Don't do that, as I said, for my one year anniversary,

03:40:38.780 --> 03:40:41.340
I'm gonna purchase the KU100 microphone.

03:40:41.340 --> 03:40:43.500
It's gonna be out of my money, I'm happy to do that.

03:40:43.500 --> 03:40:45.260
I wanna experiment with that mic,

03:40:45.260 --> 03:40:46.940
and say I'm a real ace, Mars, wink, wink,

03:40:46.940 --> 03:40:49.900
even though I don't have the setup at all enabled for it.

03:40:51.100 --> 03:40:53.900
No, don't do that, don't give me that kind of money.

03:40:55.180 --> 03:40:55.980
Wrap it up.

03:40:55.980 --> 03:40:58.140
That's too much money for one person to have.

03:40:58.140 --> 03:40:59.340
A multiverse?

03:40:59.340 --> 03:41:00.300
I don't think so.

03:41:00.300 --> 03:41:01.820
Too much money for one person to have.

03:41:01.820 --> 03:41:03.580
A multiverse, honestly.

03:41:06.380 --> 03:41:08.940
Mommy, you've been playing with the weebaw for like 10 minutes.

03:41:08.940 --> 03:41:10.620
I mean, I can touch it too, so like...

03:41:13.340 --> 03:41:14.940
You can get down here if you like.

03:41:16.540 --> 03:41:17.900
Or does that make it weirder?

03:41:17.900 --> 03:41:19.260
I don't know, 10 of the weirds.

03:41:20.380 --> 03:41:21.580
Supply in.

03:41:21.580 --> 03:41:23.100
You want me to sit on it?

03:41:23.100 --> 03:41:23.980
I don't even know what's...

03:41:23.980 --> 03:41:24.620
Is it gonna...

03:41:24.620 --> 03:41:27.580
If it explodes everywhere, you're fucking cleaning this up.

03:41:27.580 --> 03:41:28.780
Do you understand reefling?

03:41:29.420 --> 03:41:34.060
If this explodes, you are cleaning up.

03:41:34.060 --> 03:41:36.060
All the little balls are about to go everywhere.

03:41:36.700 --> 03:41:37.260
Hold on.

03:41:37.900 --> 03:41:38.220
Oh.

03:41:39.340 --> 03:41:41.260
I can't see it squishing out.

03:41:41.820 --> 03:41:42.540
Just approve.

03:41:42.540 --> 03:41:44.140
Oh, sorry, my duplicate.

03:41:44.140 --> 03:41:46.700
Someone, please think of the health of my duplicate part.

03:41:46.700 --> 03:41:47.500
Thank you, thank you.

03:41:49.100 --> 03:41:49.820
Can you see it?

03:41:50.620 --> 03:41:51.180
It's not...

03:41:51.180 --> 03:41:52.540
Oh, there's one more card, hold on.

03:41:53.740 --> 03:41:57.740
If this freaking breaks...

03:41:57.820 --> 03:41:58.860
I'm gonna be so mad.

03:42:00.540 --> 03:42:01.660
It's not really...

03:42:04.060 --> 03:42:04.780
Alleycraft?

03:42:07.020 --> 03:42:08.780
It looks like a tail, honestly.

03:42:08.780 --> 03:42:10.620
It looks like a weird marshmallow tail.

03:42:18.620 --> 03:42:21.420
Mami, you're gonna make that reeflings ball explode, honestly.

03:42:22.220 --> 03:42:23.900
Oh, excuse me, I'm just standing up.

03:42:23.900 --> 03:42:25.340
Oh, excuse me.

03:42:26.300 --> 03:42:27.260
That's terrible.

03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:33.500
Mami, did you know those balls are wet inside?

03:42:33.500 --> 03:42:34.700
So, last time I'm saying the things,

03:42:34.700 --> 03:42:37.980
well, you're cleaning up a cinematic universe.

03:42:37.980 --> 03:42:39.260
It's gonna go hard, honestly.

03:42:40.860 --> 03:42:41.820
She's too good.

03:42:41.820 --> 03:42:43.340
So, you're gonna buy another one then.

03:42:43.340 --> 03:42:44.220
Another ball?

03:42:44.220 --> 03:42:46.540
What, you want me to have two balls to play with on stream?

03:42:47.260 --> 03:42:49.260
I never thought that far ahead, but that makes sense.

03:42:50.060 --> 03:42:51.340
Typical nation thing for the set.

03:42:52.060 --> 03:42:54.380
Someone said, like,

03:42:54.460 --> 03:42:56.220
oh, I want to try and repay you for the thingy.

03:42:56.220 --> 03:42:57.340
No, you don't understand.

03:42:57.340 --> 03:42:58.380
I'm in debt to you.

03:42:59.100 --> 03:43:02.220
Do you understand, like, how happy I am and how fulfilled I am

03:43:02.220 --> 03:43:07.900
and, like, just how amazing it is to, like, be with you, like, reefling?

03:43:07.900 --> 03:43:12.140
Like, I don't know how to say it.

03:43:12.140 --> 03:43:13.500
Like, you're not in debt to me.

03:43:13.500 --> 03:43:15.020
You don't have to show me any kindness.

03:43:15.020 --> 03:43:17.820
You don't need XYZ, Elemental P, anything like that.

03:43:18.540 --> 03:43:20.940
I'm just fucking happy to be here.

03:43:20.940 --> 03:43:22.140
That is the bottom line.

03:43:22.140 --> 03:43:28.140
And the truth is, I'll never be able to repay you for anything like that, you know?

03:43:29.900 --> 03:43:31.500
So don't be, uh, yeah.

03:43:32.540 --> 03:43:35.900
I think you're now tapped for more time than you've spent.

03:43:35.900 --> 03:43:37.660
Opening car, I'm sorry.

03:43:37.660 --> 03:43:38.780
I've yapped, yeah.

03:43:39.740 --> 03:43:40.620
Sorry, I can't sub.

03:43:40.620 --> 03:43:41.900
No, it's not like that.

03:43:41.900 --> 03:43:42.860
You don't have to.

03:43:42.860 --> 03:43:43.660
Like, you don't have to.

03:43:43.660 --> 03:43:45.020
That's why I stream every single day.

03:43:45.020 --> 03:43:46.620
Like, even though I do membership streams,

03:43:46.620 --> 03:43:48.860
it's not like one day I do a membership stream

03:43:48.860 --> 03:43:49.820
and no stream on that day.

03:43:49.820 --> 03:43:53.020
Like, no, I do like a regular, schmagular stream.

03:43:53.660 --> 03:43:56.620
And then, like, because it's not like that.

03:43:56.620 --> 03:43:57.740
Like, don't think it's like that.

03:43:57.740 --> 03:43:59.180
Don't, don't get it twisted.

03:44:00.620 --> 03:44:02.860
What a strongy stream without a good app.

03:44:02.860 --> 03:44:04.220
One PP touch on the debt.

03:44:04.220 --> 03:44:05.020
It's paid.

03:44:05.660 --> 03:44:06.460
I either can.

03:44:06.460 --> 03:44:08.220
I'm currently, no, you don't have to.

03:44:08.220 --> 03:44:09.340
Like, don't think like that.

03:44:12.300 --> 03:44:13.900
My prediction for 5-0 stream.

03:44:13.900 --> 03:44:22.940
He's a tenner for sitting on your ball.

03:44:22.940 --> 03:44:24.620
Did he deserve that?

03:44:24.620 --> 03:44:25.340
Did it hurt?

03:44:25.340 --> 03:44:26.860
But did it hurt good?

03:44:26.860 --> 03:44:28.540
Thank you, basically, Liz, for the tip.

03:44:29.660 --> 03:44:31.340
My predictions for a 5-hour stream.

03:44:31.340 --> 03:44:31.900
What are we at?

03:44:34.940 --> 03:44:35.660
How long?

03:44:36.860 --> 03:44:39.420
It was 3 hours 44 minutes ago.

03:44:39.420 --> 03:44:39.900
The fuck?

03:44:41.340 --> 03:44:42.780
Who else has a shit ton of money

03:44:42.780 --> 03:44:43.900
to throw this woman in now?

03:44:45.900 --> 03:44:46.620
Oh my gosh.

03:44:52.620 --> 03:44:55.180
Well, how about we both agree that it goes both ways?

03:44:56.220 --> 03:44:58.060
How much for socks off?

03:44:58.060 --> 03:45:00.220
No, don't give me money for that.

03:45:00.220 --> 03:45:01.020
I'm not sure.

03:45:01.020 --> 03:45:03.420
I've still got my pedicure on my feet

03:45:03.420 --> 03:45:04.540
and I don't like how it looks,

03:45:04.540 --> 03:45:06.300
so I don't like showing my feet right now.

03:45:06.300 --> 03:45:07.980
Typical nation, thank you for the tip.

03:45:07.980 --> 03:45:09.500
Spidey, keep your money.

03:45:09.500 --> 03:45:11.180
Don't fucking give me money.

03:45:12.140 --> 03:45:13.740
Right, okay, okay, okay.

03:45:13.740 --> 03:45:15.180
I'll redirect into Marisa.

03:45:15.180 --> 03:45:19.900
Let's wrap up like a protection layer.

03:45:21.980 --> 03:45:23.660
Well, I'll wrap it up, okay?

03:45:23.660 --> 03:45:27.660
Right, I'm gonna redirect into damn it, I don't...

03:45:27.660 --> 03:45:29.900
Unless Shibi is streaming.

03:45:29.900 --> 03:45:31.260
Shibi, technically, what?

03:45:31.260 --> 03:45:31.900
Should be up in...

03:45:33.420 --> 03:45:35.260
Should Shibi be up in 10 minutes?

03:45:36.300 --> 03:45:37.260
Am I going mental?

03:45:39.260 --> 03:45:40.940
No, she doesn't have her waiting room.

03:45:40.940 --> 03:45:42.540
So is Emi going waiting room's up?

03:45:42.540 --> 03:45:44.060
Is this being cancelled?

03:45:46.620 --> 03:45:49.260
I guess it's been cancelled.

03:45:51.420 --> 03:45:52.860
Oh, no, Emi can't stream anyway.

03:45:52.860 --> 03:45:54.140
Dumbass, Emi can't stream.

03:45:54.140 --> 03:45:56.140
That's why the fucking thing can't be cancelled.

03:45:56.140 --> 03:45:57.100
Dumbass, dumbass.

03:45:58.700 --> 03:46:00.540
Okay, I'm gonna...

03:46:00.540 --> 03:46:02.060
No, stop giving me money, I'm going.

03:46:02.060 --> 03:46:03.500
So my money, okay.

03:46:03.500 --> 03:46:06.540
No, Kalker, thank you for the tip.

03:46:07.420 --> 03:46:08.540
Yep.

03:46:08.540 --> 03:46:09.900
No, Emi, who?

03:46:10.940 --> 03:46:13.580
Emi, B-Soup, sorry that you didn't recognize the name.

03:46:13.580 --> 03:46:15.580
Okay, sorry you didn't recognize the name.

03:46:15.580 --> 03:46:16.460
Shibi has the members.

03:46:16.460 --> 03:46:17.980
Marisa is the only one that's been public.

03:46:17.980 --> 03:46:19.260
Okay, I'll redirect into them.

03:46:19.260 --> 03:46:20.220
Okay, look at this.

03:46:26.220 --> 03:46:27.340
This is payment-along.

03:46:27.340 --> 03:46:28.700
I'm just telling you that everything is okay

03:46:28.700 --> 03:46:30.620
while I give you hugs and headpats.

03:46:31.100 --> 03:46:33.900
Oh, that's actually easy.

03:46:33.900 --> 03:46:35.740
Thank you for the donation.

03:46:35.740 --> 03:46:37.020
Right, no more fucking money.

03:46:37.020 --> 03:46:38.140
Stop it, you're stalling me.

03:46:38.140 --> 03:46:39.580
And I don't want to stall for money.

03:46:39.580 --> 03:46:40.620
It makes me uncomfortable.

03:46:41.340 --> 03:46:43.100
Twenty seconds, I really need to wee.

03:46:43.100 --> 03:46:43.900
Okay, go pee.

03:46:45.180 --> 03:46:46.460
Don't read this stream.

03:46:46.460 --> 03:46:48.140
I'm sorry if this comes off as angry.

03:46:59.900 --> 03:47:00.300
Okay.

03:47:02.060 --> 03:47:02.380
True.

03:47:03.340 --> 03:47:05.740
Barbecue pulled pork sandwiches or burgers.

03:47:05.740 --> 03:47:07.180
What do you want for dinner?

03:47:07.180 --> 03:47:09.260
Are you making me food?

03:47:09.260 --> 03:47:10.860
Oh my gosh.

03:47:10.860 --> 03:47:11.820
What would you look?

03:47:11.820 --> 03:47:13.260
Beef or pork?

03:47:13.260 --> 03:47:15.100
I would say burgers

03:47:15.100 --> 03:47:17.180
because you can put lettuce on it and cheese.

03:47:18.220 --> 03:47:21.740
I like lettuce and burgers because it's a nice crunch.

03:47:23.340 --> 03:47:24.780
It's so good.

03:47:24.780 --> 03:47:26.540
That reef one had some shit to say.

03:47:26.540 --> 03:47:27.580
Sorry, quietly.

03:47:28.140 --> 03:47:29.580
Jimmy, B-Soup,

03:47:29.580 --> 03:47:32.060
Stronathan, Cthulhu, Cthulhu?

03:47:33.020 --> 03:47:34.140
Cthulhu.

03:47:34.140 --> 03:47:35.340
Oh, Cthulhu.

03:47:35.340 --> 03:47:36.140
That's not bad.

03:47:36.140 --> 03:47:37.340
That's not bad.

03:47:37.340 --> 03:47:37.980
Love you, Stron.

03:47:37.980 --> 03:47:39.100
I love you too, reef one.

03:47:39.100 --> 03:47:39.660
Thank you for the stream.

03:47:39.660 --> 03:47:40.780
No, thank you for the stream.

03:47:42.220 --> 03:47:43.820
I apologize for yapping

03:47:43.820 --> 03:47:45.340
when this was supposed to be a handcam.

03:47:45.340 --> 03:47:47.100
It's literally just my feet kicking a ball around.

03:47:47.100 --> 03:47:48.380
But literally, we're playing footy.

03:47:53.180 --> 03:47:55.420
Strony, you should tell me what to edge to later.

03:47:55.420 --> 03:47:55.980
Me, bitch.

03:47:56.860 --> 03:47:58.780
I have like three audios on the alt square.

03:47:58.780 --> 03:48:01.100
Go, listen to them again and tell me you don't like that shit.

03:48:02.700 --> 03:48:05.340
And it's a nice, yeah.

03:48:05.340 --> 03:48:06.700
But I do enjoy getting that.

03:48:06.700 --> 03:48:07.660
Love you, mommie.

03:48:07.660 --> 03:48:08.620
So I'm getting distracted.

03:48:08.620 --> 03:48:09.420
Right, I'm going.

03:48:09.420 --> 03:48:10.220
I'm going to work.

03:48:10.220 --> 03:48:11.580
Right, what do you want me to do before?

03:48:11.580 --> 03:48:12.940
Do you want to like a little dance?

03:48:14.700 --> 03:48:16.140
Or do we pretend that this is...

03:48:17.420 --> 03:48:18.060
I don't know.

03:48:19.340 --> 03:48:20.940
What would you like me to do before we go?

03:48:20.940 --> 03:48:21.980
Before we wrap it up?

03:48:21.980 --> 03:48:22.940
Come and walk again.

03:48:22.940 --> 03:48:23.820
Here, here.

03:48:24.540 --> 03:48:25.820
I'm Michael Jackson.

03:48:25.820 --> 03:48:27.100
I touch little things.

03:48:27.900 --> 03:48:29.820
Who said that?

03:48:29.820 --> 03:48:30.700
That's wrong.

03:48:30.700 --> 03:48:32.780
How many nostrils does Michael Jackson have?

03:48:36.780 --> 03:48:37.580
Brick down there.

03:48:38.780 --> 03:48:39.500
Put it down there.

03:48:41.020 --> 03:48:42.220
Oh, you can see me thrusting.

03:48:43.180 --> 03:48:44.620
You put your hands on your hips.

03:48:50.220 --> 03:48:51.660
Remove the thoughts and take the...

03:48:52.540 --> 03:48:53.740
I'm not ruining the thoughts.

03:48:53.740 --> 03:48:56.540
My feet size, big monster feet.

03:48:56.540 --> 03:48:57.340
All right, hold on.

03:48:57.340 --> 03:48:58.540
Are you guys going to put Pokemon cards?

03:48:58.540 --> 03:49:00.300
Are you going to put Pokemon cards at home?

03:49:01.660 --> 03:49:05.420
Can you use that Pokemon card?

03:49:07.100 --> 03:49:10.060
Like, if I do it from my heel there,

03:49:10.060 --> 03:49:11.740
I'm like two Pokemon cards.

03:49:11.740 --> 03:49:14.860
And a bit more, like a third Pokemon card comes into it.

03:49:16.140 --> 03:49:17.420
Just a jump to the top.

03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:21.580
Can you join the ace monster?

03:49:21.580 --> 03:49:22.940
Ooh, you're in for a treat tomorrow.

03:49:24.700 --> 03:49:25.340
Okay.

03:49:25.340 --> 03:49:26.380
Oh no, my fucking...

03:49:26.380 --> 03:49:27.580
Oh, my phone's dying.

03:49:28.380 --> 03:49:29.100
Right, wrap it up.

03:49:29.100 --> 03:49:29.820
My phone's dead.

03:49:29.820 --> 03:49:30.300
Wrap it up.

03:49:30.300 --> 03:49:31.420
The fucking trash is dead.

03:49:33.500 --> 03:49:33.980
Wrap it up.

03:49:33.980 --> 03:49:34.860
The track is gone.

03:49:34.860 --> 03:49:35.820
The track is gone.

03:49:35.820 --> 03:49:37.020
Reeflings, bedtime.

03:49:37.020 --> 03:49:37.660
Bedtime, right.

03:49:37.660 --> 03:49:38.460
Everyone go to bed.

03:49:38.460 --> 03:49:39.020
Go to sleep.

03:49:39.660 --> 03:49:40.860
Do you have a banana for scale?

03:49:42.300 --> 03:49:43.820
The real Pokemon...

03:49:43.820 --> 03:49:45.260
The real measurements are Pokemon.

03:49:45.260 --> 03:49:46.700
Forget kilometers.

03:49:46.700 --> 03:49:49.340
Forget the other unit of measurement.

03:49:49.340 --> 03:49:49.820
Yards?

03:49:51.020 --> 03:49:52.060
Oh god, do you see your...

03:49:52.060 --> 03:49:54.620
No, you can't see your feet are three yards long.

03:49:54.620 --> 03:49:55.820
That doesn't make any sense.

03:49:57.100 --> 03:49:57.660
Truly not.

03:49:58.700 --> 03:49:59.260
Truly not.

03:49:59.980 --> 03:50:01.980
Mommy's falling to sleep on us.

03:50:01.980 --> 03:50:02.300
No.

03:50:03.180 --> 03:50:04.860
It's time to tuck you into bed.

03:50:05.980 --> 03:50:07.340
After I give you the good suck.

03:50:08.380 --> 03:50:09.900
Are you gonna be okay?

03:50:12.060 --> 03:50:13.180
Are you gonna be okay?

03:50:13.180 --> 03:50:16.780
Now strip off and bounce on that peach on my tentacle.

03:50:16.940 --> 03:50:25.820
I love reading your marshmallows.

03:50:25.820 --> 03:50:26.540
Seriously.

03:50:27.340 --> 03:50:29.180
Yours are so out of pocket.

03:50:29.180 --> 03:50:30.780
Like the start of the marshmallow.

03:50:30.780 --> 03:50:33.180
The reason why I read that sentence out loud.

03:50:33.180 --> 03:50:34.540
Strony, you're so sweet.

03:50:34.540 --> 03:50:35.980
You're sweet too, Reefling.

03:50:35.980 --> 03:50:37.740
The love is completely mutual.

03:50:37.740 --> 03:50:39.900
Now strip off and bounce that peach on my tentacle.

03:50:43.420 --> 03:50:45.900
Yeah, my track is down.

03:50:47.020 --> 03:50:47.580
Who said that?

03:50:47.580 --> 03:50:48.780
Who stole my idea?

03:50:48.780 --> 03:50:49.420
Give it back.

03:50:51.580 --> 03:50:54.060
Those five minutes almost made me pee my jeans.

03:50:54.060 --> 03:50:55.820
Then don't ask for permission again.

03:50:56.540 --> 03:50:57.980
Because I'm gonna make you good.

03:50:57.980 --> 03:50:58.300
Okay.

03:50:59.180 --> 03:51:00.620
You get spanking.

03:51:00.620 --> 03:51:03.020
Reef, I love you lot.

03:51:03.980 --> 03:51:07.660
I apologize that this hand cam stream turned into a foot cam.

03:51:09.420 --> 03:51:10.460
I would say I'm sorry.

03:51:11.820 --> 03:51:12.860
But am I?

03:51:12.860 --> 03:51:13.500
No.

03:51:13.580 --> 03:51:17.100
I give you the content that you do not ask for nor want.

03:51:17.900 --> 03:51:20.540
And you must be thankful for it.

03:51:20.540 --> 03:51:22.940
You will be grateful for what I provide.

03:51:22.940 --> 03:51:25.580
Even though you did not request it at all.

03:51:27.100 --> 03:51:27.580
At all.

03:51:30.700 --> 03:51:32.540
Beat or just the hands of the man.

03:51:32.540 --> 03:51:33.180
That's true.

03:51:33.180 --> 03:51:35.020
I mean you need to bounce on my feet.

03:51:35.020 --> 03:51:36.140
Okay, right, right.

03:51:36.940 --> 03:51:38.140
I love you little Reeflings.

03:51:38.140 --> 03:51:38.620
I'm gonna go.

03:51:38.620 --> 03:51:40.780
I'm gonna redirect into Mercy's karaoke.

03:51:41.100 --> 03:51:42.300
It will be unarchived.

03:51:43.740 --> 03:51:46.540
Just as a heads up because of copyright issues as always.

03:51:46.540 --> 03:51:47.340
YouTube ruins it.

03:51:48.220 --> 03:51:49.900
Thank you everyone for hanging.

03:51:52.620 --> 03:51:54.140
And for chilling.

03:51:54.140 --> 03:51:54.940
And binchini.

03:51:54.940 --> 03:51:56.940
Don't you want binchini?

03:51:56.940 --> 03:51:57.580
Right on my nose.

03:51:57.580 --> 03:51:58.540
Okay, you're done.

03:52:00.060 --> 03:52:01.260
Please look after yourselves.

03:52:01.260 --> 03:52:04.220
Tomorrow we are getting up to.

03:52:04.220 --> 03:52:06.460
Let's find out what we're getting up to tomorrow.

03:52:07.180 --> 03:52:09.660
We are playing with Portal 2.

03:52:09.660 --> 03:52:12.380
With Sheevee who has never played the game before.

03:52:12.380 --> 03:52:14.380
So don't be a stinker then.

03:52:14.380 --> 03:52:16.540
I can never remember the last few puzzles.

03:52:16.540 --> 03:52:18.460
They get a bit too advanced for my brain.

03:52:19.180 --> 03:52:20.380
But thank you so so much.

03:52:20.380 --> 03:52:22.860
I will see you tomorrow for the shaggagagans.

03:52:22.860 --> 03:52:24.460
Let me and Sheepsters we'll be up to.

03:52:24.460 --> 03:52:26.300
And we're gonna see if we can finish it in one go.

03:52:26.300 --> 03:52:27.980
I warned her it's five hours long.

03:52:28.620 --> 03:52:31.020
But I might be able to remember the puzzles.

03:52:31.020 --> 03:52:32.460
I'm gonna give her a blast with it.

03:52:32.460 --> 03:52:34.380
But we can almost come back to it later if she gets the time.

03:52:34.380 --> 03:52:35.100
It's not a problem.

03:52:35.100 --> 03:52:35.660
Not a problem.

03:52:35.660 --> 03:52:37.820
And I know I know these things, okay.

03:52:37.900 --> 03:52:40.060
All right I love you lots I'll see you tomorrow please.

03:52:40.060 --> 03:52:41.100
Remember to hydrate.

03:52:41.660 --> 03:52:42.220
Hydrate.

03:52:43.260 --> 03:52:44.300
Remember to rest.

03:52:45.900 --> 03:52:47.660
Remember to look after yourself.

03:52:49.100 --> 03:52:53.020
Remember to wash behind your ears and your belly button.

03:52:53.020 --> 03:52:54.780
And scrub yourself down with a flannel.

03:52:56.620 --> 03:52:59.900
And remember to eat and be kind to yourself.

03:53:01.020 --> 03:53:01.340
Okay.

03:53:02.300 --> 03:53:03.740
And remember you're still being denied.

03:53:03.900 --> 03:53:08.220
But you enjoy mercy.

03:53:08.220 --> 03:53:08.700
Okay.

03:53:08.700 --> 03:53:10.380
When she comes up she's coming up soon.

03:53:10.380 --> 03:53:11.100
Okay.

03:53:11.100 --> 03:53:13.660
But you put you put you.

03:53:13.660 --> 03:53:16.540
That's supposed to be the sound effects from Brian.

03:53:16.540 --> 03:53:18.140
But I don't have the thing plugged in.

03:53:18.860 --> 03:53:20.700
See you later alligator.

03:53:20.700 --> 03:53:22.300
In a wild crocodile.

03:53:22.300 --> 03:53:26.780
And then I'll give you kisses for mimicry.

03:53:26.780 --> 03:53:27.740
I think there was nine packs.

03:53:27.740 --> 03:53:28.460
One clue.

03:53:28.460 --> 03:53:29.100
We want one.

03:53:29.900 --> 03:53:32.620
One, two, three, four, seven, eight, nine.

03:53:32.700 --> 03:53:33.180
Nine packs.

03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:36.220
Okay nine packs.

03:53:36.220 --> 03:53:37.100
Bye bye.

03:53:37.100 --> 03:53:37.900
See you tomorrow.

03:53:39.180 --> 03:53:39.740
I kissed you.

03:53:43.020 --> 03:53:43.820
See you tomorrow.

03:53:43.820 --> 03:53:44.380
Bye bye.
