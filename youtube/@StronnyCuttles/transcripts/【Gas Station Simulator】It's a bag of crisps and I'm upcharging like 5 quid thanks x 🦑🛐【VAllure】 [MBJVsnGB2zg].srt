1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
The

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:27,260
U.S.

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:51,280
It doesn't it.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:01,960
I'm fine, I got a stinger, ayy, ayy, how's it going, I got a stinger, leave me, leave me,

5
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,960
ayy.

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,560
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, here's the game counts.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:18,280
Uh, Sheevie's currently live right now with Elden Ring, the blessed background music.

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
Is this still playing?

9
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,800
It is, see that was the problem.

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,280
That's the problem when you use your background music, you're in trouble.

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
No, we're not even started, jeez.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,520
Good morning, good evening, good afternoon, how are you?

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
Did you sleep?

14
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,280
No, I was up fucking getting a new manager.

15
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Um, there's a manager that's coming in, so I essentially don't do anything at the

16
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,880
show, shout out to my stinger, you are a real one, turns out my other stinger is broken,

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,880
so the best you're getting is the little seashell one, which is really cute, I think

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
it's a cute one.

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,560
Um, no sleep, no, I was up all night, I was having a fucking good con, so my girls were

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,360
asking for a manager and I was like, I couldn't really justify it, but then there was a major

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:28,240
communication error and like, you know, a lot of things happened and it was all over

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,760
a miscommunication, like a misunderstanding, and I'm like, so the plan was never for me

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:44,760
to be on the team in terms, like all the time, I was essentially going to be like an advisor

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:55,120
in terms of like content creation or things that might work out, um, it's not even yet

25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,720
by, it's just a misunderstanding, I'm like, I checked Marshmallow and it's like, fucking

26
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:09,080
someone sent 10 minutes ago, I hope you're happy with your money, like, you know, you'll

27
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,640
learn that there's more to life than your money, and I'm like, is this over the fucking

28
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
fanzly situation?

29
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm like, I can assure you right now, I have not told one fucking girl to quit fanzly,

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,480
like I can say that, as I said, there was clearly a miscommunication, and it was taken

31
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,880
the wrong way, and I've just been absolutely fucking like dragged through the filth and

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:42,760
I'm like, you know, it just feels frustrating, because, you know, you give it your all and

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,280
it may look like it's been three months of give it my all, but obviously, you know, when

34
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,440
you're cooking in the background, it's months and months before as well, um, like, obviously

35
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,760
like I blocked and moved on because it was like, don't be so fucking stupid about like,

36
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,320
oh, this is clearly for greed, I was like, there's not to fucking spoil anything, but

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,920
there's a really big development in the works that was decided very shortly after debut

38
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:22,400
and paid for by me, surprise, surprise, and like, there's projects ongoing, and you know,

39
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,880
the girls get what they want, and it's just like, just a really shite situation all over,

40
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:38,600
um, and it's just really annoying, because it's like, can when you try your best, that's

41
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:48,280
one, and it just like, fucking like crumbles apart, because of a mis-input is, it's just

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,200
bizarre, like, I didn't even know how to put it in a words, sounds like Twitter drama,

43
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,840
yeah, I was like, oh, where'd you do that thing, and it's like, maybe physics accounts

44
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,120
for faffing, and I wanted to defend myself, I can assure you right now, I never told anyone

45
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,680
to, I didn't randomly tell one talent to quit the website, but everyone else can miraculously

46
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,280
stay up, like, sorry, I'm not tolerating it, then it'd be silly, that like genuinely, then it'd be

47
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,520
silly, um, that's the annoying thing about being like such an open agency, is that

48
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:35,000
someone can say, what the fuck is that, um, someone can say one thing, another talent can

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,120
say the other, and then it's like, I get the blame for everything that goes on at management,

50
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,400
where at the end of the day, my responsibilities are getting less and less, I was never supposed to

51
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,960
fully be on the team in the way that I am, um, like, there's about to be a manager coming to play

52
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,600
in that, eh, and someone that handles the audios, and I'm legit just gonna be a streamer, so I guess

53
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,480
this is my note, if you have any grievances, then I bother using my marshmallows, I'm off the team,

54
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:13,320
go use the website, because like, this is just silly enough, and bonds broke over less, the fact

55
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,240
that you keep things together, I just, it's just silly, that's like, I'm not really, that obviously,

56
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,200
I'm not that pleased anymore, like yesterday I was upset about it, but today I'm like,

57
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,920
you're kinda not even seeing the picture at all, and it's just like, hopefully when this like,

58
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,560
secret event that comes out, and the secret project that comes out, it's like, well obviously it

59
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:45,640
wasn't for fucking Grigiamong, like honestly, just the, what the fuck, what is this, pick up,

60
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,760
okay, we have a physics engine, and our beloved game gas station similiar,

61
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,960
eh, oh, there's a piece of paper out there, not to get excited, but this goon cave could really

62
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,720
be spruced up about it, you know, right, oh, I don't know, some people hide behind the shadows,

63
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,080
oh yeah, like, I can't get out, had a little too many cups of honey tea,

64
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,720
no, like, I'm so sorry if you've sent me on Marshmallow recently, I've literally been too

65
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,840
scared to check them all over this like, fucking, miscommunication, and I genuinely thought people

66
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,520
would be, you know, wise enough to, of course I didn't randomly tell, like, what's going on over here,

67
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:55,160
it's dancing, it's so tantalizing, what are you, oh, it's a generator, I want this though,

68
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:03,320
none of us we've been thinking it for years, yeah, like, I just, then you can, how you go 20% of

69
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:14,440
coyotes, you found a card, okay, those are cards, hey, thank you for becoming a membo,

70
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,440
that's a true fake one, it's just gonna start driving me, you depressed on purpose,

71
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,000
because they read all of my emails, yeah, like, I've never had time to, like, look at them,

72
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
like, I too, I can't believe it, oh Christmas, I did so much work in the background, like, for

73
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,280
myself and future content, and like, one hour later, I opened up my Marshmallow and it's like,

74
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:47,080
why do you hate Mercy in particular, I'm like, what the fuck are you going on about, and like,

75
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,640
I met, obviously, Mercy, I'm like, hey, what's going on here, and she told me some things,

76
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,600
and I was like, oh, that makes sense now, because that was really unexpected, press P to open photo

77
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,880
mode, yeah, let's take a picture of that, okay, we don't need that, follow the high voltage cable

78
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,360
to find and turn the electric, what the fuck, I thought this is like, gonna be like,

79
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:21,480
supermarket simulator where it's all ready to go, hello, follow a voltage cable, this, this,

80
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,880
follow a high voltage cable, I mean, I wouldn't put my hand on it, so I consider this high voltage,

81
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,480
isn't this not where I just got that calling, you don't have to apologize for the idiots who got

82
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:46,120
bought her, I don't know, like, it just kind of feels like one of the situations where,

83
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,480
unironically, the fucking Captain Picard quote, and it's like, you can do everything right and

84
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,000
still lose, that's life type thing, I was like, of course I don't hate them, of course I don't

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,600
want them not to make money, of course this is like, just, it's just silliness, and like,

86
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,960
oh, I know streamers not supposed to show weakness, I thought an uncle,

87
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:24,120
since you've heard my voice now, hasn't it, yes, I'm a busy person, but luck would have it,

88
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,760
that the land you've purchased once belonged to my father, since you are not only a potential

89
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,920
business partner, but family no less, I'll do my best to help you, I will send you

90
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,560
emails on a regular basis, providing you with information on how to handle the Japan business,

91
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:51,560
decided not to do other website, but management never asked that, it's not like we went to one

92
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,960
talent and said, he used, stop, it was like, no, it's completely up to her, it's absolutely

93
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,760
completely up to her, and I can say this now, I put an update in the discord and said, do it as

94
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:10,280
much as you want, because I tried to explain like, hey we can't invest in zero percent of nothing,

95
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,240
and that was kind of the thing, but not my terms, and this is not like super market

96
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,360
simulator, when you can do what you want, and it's not as good, oh it's got both of his,

97
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:36,360
Mr Roboto, Roboto, a small hiccup, literally, what the fuck are they on about, and no one has been

98
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,880
forbidden, and it was literally a simple like, oh hey here's a few points I wanted to raise,

99
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,280
and everything's a discussion, it's not like some random fucking dictatorship, what the fuck,

100
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:59,160
how, I thought this was a super market simulator game, what is going on, achievement unlocked,

101
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:06,040
ruddy, ruddy what, what am I supposed to do, I'm just following the question marks on the maps,

102
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,440
no fuel, and you'll never guess what I just purchased, if I've got any fuel,

103
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,600
yee-haw partner, literally what's going on, is this already, no smoking stop motor,

104
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,360
are you squidding me right now, that's well, we just got a flood you with more love to balance

105
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,200
the scales, I don't mean talking about it, because I know, oh my god, streamers are not supposed to

106
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,720
ever acknowledge that they've ever felt sad for one day or one second type thing,

107
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,200
but it's like, I've had three months of not like, not one bit of negativity, and then one fucking

108
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,680
miscommunication resulted in that, I'm like, Jesus fucking Christ, I've not got like a slight bit

109
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,600
of grace, like originally the manager, I do love following the question mark games, this is really

110
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,560
looks like my summer car american edition,

111
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,840
what's this, why is it so low, checkpoint, oh it's not a save,

112
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,920
marks and spinsters, 1-88, sorry I shouldn't call you that because I thought you meant,

113
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,960
eight minutes, thank you, the booty lord, are you certified to run that piece of equipment,

114
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:24,120
absolutely not, Osha is afraid of me, okay, don't show sad, literally like I've had three months of

115
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:37,800
just like, did I not, press tab to open tools, is this an old school pump, I think it is,

116
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,600
um, Osha's the reason why strone exist, no strone is the reason why Osha exists,

117
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:53,960
um, empty, press tango from, no, I don't, how do I put you down, tab, no, take out your hand,

118
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:06,120
and then go inside, current task, return to removing the sand pail, okay,

119
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:19,240
what is this, oh my gosh, I'm like an actual man, oh, the old ball and chain, how do I do this,

120
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,000
oh I've already got it, it's already full, where do I put it,

121
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,800
ah, oh my god, I love games that have a big question mark on the screen, so you're not confused

122
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:41,560
where you need to go, I'm man on stream, it's me, I'm forklift certified, all the ladies want me,

123
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:52,200
and all the men fear me, oh shit, I'm fucking falling into the ditch, oh yeah, now what,

124
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,600
task complete, can I just leave, can I just leave this here, how do I get out, press F to quit,

125
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,800
yeah, I'm gonna just leave that there, thank you for your service buddy,

126
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,680
we have a code form, let me just drive in, it's Olga, right, I assume in order to get

127
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,520
customers in, we need to put the, there's loads of flies at the head, I dropped it,

128
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,720
roof painting, that roof is rather well put together, if you take into consideration everything,

129
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:37,080
whoa, okay, but yeah, I was, there was, so the manager was supposed to come in like,

130
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,880
either in a couple of months, or by the time Jen to happen, but I'm like, yeah, I'm not getting

131
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:51,080
shagged because of a misunderstanding, so there's gonna be a manager coming in, so if a girl's all

132
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:59,080
complaining about a manager, yeah, party or horror, no, not really, I'm still doing like,

133
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,760
the YouTube and script stuff and that, but like, actual responsibilities are not to do with me

134
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,680
anymore, because yeah, but I was always gonna end up like that, just couldn't do it at the start,

135
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,240
because it was like, I was like making shorts or scripting them, but then like,

136
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,000
was like needing to communicate, like, hey, I'm not gonna be making all the content on you, whoa.

137
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,440
Are you squiddin' me right now? Yee-haw, what in carnation?

138
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Oh yeah, you're giving me positive affirmations.

139
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,120
Oh, you're giving me positive affirmations.

140
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,160
What if we positively affirmated over each other's faces all day long?

141
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Dot gar, thank you for the super chat.

142
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,320
Plap, plap, plap, get positively affirmated.

143
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,160
I'm trying to make this place look thingy, but am I supposed to go back and forth like this, or

144
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,760
is there like a function where I can put some stuff, not one by one, because like,

145
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,320
I can't remember that Noah's Ark song, but it's kind of like,

146
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:17,640
she takes the planks off the window, herza, herza, she's walkin' to the dumpster, herza, herza,

147
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,320
and then takin' the planks one by one, soon the job will be done, but it's a thing forever.

148
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,560
Mmm, right, yeah. Had to do my first official block on Marshmallow,

149
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,720
that's when you know it's been going, actually, to be honest, that's when you know it's been

150
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,000
absolutely amazing, if you're three months in, and it was like, oh, the first ever block, um,

151
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,520
type thing, but yeah, I can confidently and publicly say I did not randomly tell one person

152
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,760
to stop streaming, but everyone else is allowed to stream on the website. Smile, like, I don't know.

153
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,720
I don't know what to tell you, chief. I'm not really sure what to tell you. We love you,

154
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,800
we worked so hard for us, Readlings, and the girls. Hey! Wait, that was the part of it.

155
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,560
Me, like, I don't pick. What's this? Is this the second location I could renovate?

156
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,560
There's a cement mixer and everything, and that's my house. That's a picture of my house.

157
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,040
Thank you, chief, for the stupid chat, man. A good way of looking at it, honestly.

158
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,680
Um, I know classic streamers are supposed to show weakness, but bro, come on.

159
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,440
Transfer between maps. You can now transfer between...

160
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,800
I've not even... We're still in the tutorial. I've not even set up on this map. Why are we teleporting?

161
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,800
Task complete. Refill your fuel supplies using the computer. Remember that time

162
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:00,200
is over called paper, computer paper. Whoa, wait, can I even operate when the place looks like this?

163
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,720
Are you squiddin' me right now? You are absolutely incredible,

164
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,400
mama, and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. Love you and enjoy the love from the

165
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:20,120
reeflings. Heart, heart. Thank you. Squashy, not squishy, squashy. How do I clean this up? Is there a

166
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:30,280
burn? It says, test your skills on arcade. I'm gonna cough. I have a very dry... Are you squiddin'

167
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:39,560
me right now? Love you, mama. A reef same time. Thank you for having me. What is this? Okay, do this.

168
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,200
Thank you.

169
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,600
Have you set up a pilot boomer? What is this? Press space to jump.

170
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,560
Oh, that thing got something lying to it. Okay, press tango close. What did I do?

171
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:07,400
I wondered why that was so low. It's for the... Oh no, no, not more driving, please. Now you're

172
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:17,720
embarrassing me. No. We're not playing that mini-game again. I literally freaking got stuck

173
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:25,080
right away. Are you joking? That's so embarrassing. What's this? Your delivery has already arrived.

174
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,280
Open the valve to start filming the time. Did you just honk me? Open the valve?

175
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,480
That is embarrassing. I literally wasn't even... Are you squiddin' me right now?

176
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,480
You are doing a great job with what you are doing, Strony. We love you and we all know you

177
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:54,920
are doing the best you can. I'm beatin' up. No more fuel. Whoa. Okay, that makes a lot of sense.

178
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:03,560
Really, legend? Thank you. Yeah, like, it's just a shame because I was kind of hoping to like

179
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:10,360
still be lurking in the shadows a bit more, but... I ain't tolerating that again.

180
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Serve the customer? Oh my gosh! What state are we in if I have to do it manually?

181
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,840
Because there's states where it's illegal. Grab the injector when client is waiting.

182
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,280
Fuel cap will be outlined. Turn fuel the car by interacting with the cap and the

183
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:38,600
left shift will boost the speed. This speed? Oh my gosh, we have to help you fuel because

184
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:49,480
it's illegal. Whoa. It's illegal for you to fuel it yourself. Goodbye, lady. Wait, did you pull the...

185
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:56,840
Did you leave this open or did you close it yourself, my good sir? Well, we'll be closed it.

186
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:06,280
She be raided? Where's the mark? We're in New Jersey? Any New Jerseyers? I don't know how to clean

187
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,360
this up. This is a mess. We can't use it right now. Get it quiet.

188
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,720
It looks like pills. A broom? A trash bag and spray? I don't see that.

189
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,640
Is that cream? If it was, hopefully she'd be enjoyed her LDM.

190
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:34,680
And yeah, is this how I do it? With the trash bag, you can do small garbage with this

191
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,280
and replace garbage bags and try to figure. Finally, you need to order garbage collection.

192
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:52,360
Oh my gosh. It's women's simulator. Wait, how did it become like that? How did I get rid of the

193
00:22:52,360 --> 00:23:00,120
bigger items? They're so big. I'm trying to clean up. Oh my goodness, there's like...

194
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,760
Who would have been a perfectly good traffic cone? What's going on here?

195
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,440
I'm sniffing out the rubbish.

196
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,600
Hello bunnies. Bunnies. Here on my tangle. Are you squiddling me?

197
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
And then my hands out. I know what.

198
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,440
Misk65, thanks for becoming a... Is Brian shy? Are you squiddling me right now? Oh, right. Okay,

199
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,400
that makes sense. Dearest mama, we reeflings love you unconditionally and we all send you a

200
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,720
hug filled with lots of love. You are amazing, heart.

201
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,960
Are you squiddling me right now?

202
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:53,880
Could be waited for Kotel, but mighty as well. Praise the Kotel fish. Cast out the heretics of

203
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,120
hate. And lord of storms, thank you for this literature. Oh, it's Kotel. Oh, yeah. Right,

204
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:07,320
everyone, look alive. It's the polis. It's the polis. We've been naughty boys. How does it look?

205
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,800
Super. You just have yourself a good way, officer. A good day, shit.

206
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,720
I'm sorry, I spilled my spaghetti. Don't come back. I don't know how to speak. Right, how does it look?

207
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,240
Garbage, tab, bin bags, grab, hand, grab.

208
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,880
And then the dumpster is out back. Dispose of filled trash bags and old furniture.

209
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,480
What, just random shit? Dispose of filled trash bags and furniture.

210
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,240
Mm, I hear them.

211
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,640
Hey, I'm going to be honest. We were just trying to talk Kotel fish or made up fish.

212
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,440
I made a fishy. Made up.

213
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:07,080
Choose your teammate. Oh my goodness. Is this a gen two reference? An armadil?

214
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:22,040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'll have that later. Have that the night. No, where's the snake? Oh,

215
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,680
he went under the bed. It's fine. I thought I killed the snake. Let's put it here.

216
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,040
Hey.

217
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,120
Pig girl peak though. No, we're not having a piggy girl.

218
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,600
I think if I joined an agency and they gave me a pig, I'd be like, excuse me? Right, what am I supposed

219
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,680
to do? Am I supposed to just look at random stuff and bin it?

220
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,480
Dispose of filled trash bags and old furniture.

221
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,840
Biggest piece of junk trash bag and old furniture need to be thrown into a large trash.

222
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:06,680
So this doesn't count? Like, these don't count as you know. Oh, this does. Okay, right. You, bin.

223
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,640
Tire. You, bin. Oh, I get it now. It's literally asking me to clear out the shot.

224
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,720
Why didn't you just say that honestly? Oh, my God. I'm getting blank flashbacks because of

225
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:25,080
these stupid steel. Ah, I'm in the bin now. Hold on a minute. Is this her? Is this the room?

226
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,960
Are the reeflands inspired by fortnight cuddle fit? No.

227
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,040
The concept artist came up with everything.

228
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,280
Um, Emmy was the only one that got her design changed. Um,

229
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,680
on pin pals and like, you know, I'd rather everyone just be happy with what they're

230
00:26:52,680 --> 00:27:01,800
doing than randomly be like, no, that is not allowed type thing. So yeah, pin pals got changed.

231
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:10,600
If you want to see the old pin pal design, you can actually see it on, um,

232
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:21,720
her background music video because obviously the girls only got access to their like assets and

233
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,920
stuff. Um, like some stuff really, I can talk about the development at a later date about

234
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,920
what a nightmare it was.

235
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,960
Can you go in? In.

236
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,160
Oh, there's like garbage here too.

237
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,680
Buy a broom, press tab and equipped it. Is there even anyone here? Hello?

238
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,800
I'm, I'm so sorry for your wait.

239
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,360
I'm on.

240
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,720
Thanks. I'm so sorry. I need a broom now. Hello. Press left mouse button for our tools.

241
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,520
Yeah. So I thought this was going to be how, uh,

242
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,040
supermarket simulator played to taste a massive peach. I have terrible news.

243
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,120
Are you squidding me right now?

244
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,720
Right. Enough money. What's going on?

245
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,680
So, you know, how much love you have from us reflames? You've got at least one tuning in from

246
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,840
a construction site. Oh, please.

247
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:45,320
Uh, just in case you can't see the screen, I'm currently being haunted by Elvis. That's

248
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,920
actually really scary. Please leave me alone. What the fuck?

249
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,440
What? Is his grave like under here?

250
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,760
Aye, I don't like that. I don't know if that's supposed to be funny or not. That's actually

251
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,720
rather terrifying. I'm such a good speaker. Thank you, lonely, glizzy, what name?

252
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:22,040
Your glizzy looks lonely tonight. I can fix that. You look like a hard-working joe on your job site.

253
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,800
I think Elvis is giving this to me. Oh, can I? I'm just literally piling it up so much.

254
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:39,000
I know I probably shouldn't do it this much, but... Oh, geez. Uh, good evening.

255
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,560
Oh, out late the night, aren't we? Burning the midnight oil.

256
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,960
Okay, yeah. Now you have yourself a safe night, lady.

257
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,280
Probably shouldn't you be out at night?

258
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,240
Are you squidding me right now?

259
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,040
Oh, I've got a tip.

260
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,000
Do the restrooms here have glory holes? If so, are you going to be servicing them?

261
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,000
I had to sprinkle some out of pocket in this love soup. We got going.

262
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,320
What? What is this game? I thought it was about running up. I think it was, but I fueled it better.

263
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,840
Like, I'm getting achievements for this one.

264
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,920
Eh... Does that touch you? No.

265
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,920
I got deleted mid-read. Oh, no, what happened?

266
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,160
They had enough of you? I could still see the message.

267
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,640
Do the restrooms have... If so, are you going to be servicing them? I had to sprinkle out

268
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,640
some out of pocket in the love soup again.

269
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,000
Hey, Stronny. It's sad I just tuned in to hear about trollers coming for your throat.

270
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,640
Don't worry or we heard about it. I'm sure there were haters even before debut. Let Stronny cook.

271
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,680
Yeah, I think what it was is like, I was just so shocked because I was like, what's going on?

272
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,240
I think I need to ask for that to be taken away.

273
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,040
Because like, you know, you try your best for everyone's success and all that.

274
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,560
And it was just like getting bombarded for the first time and it was like,

275
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,720
it was really bizarre as well because it was like, why do you hate Mercy in particular?

276
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,040
And I'm like, what? Where did that come from?

277
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,440
Like, I genuinely couldn't put two and two together, so I had to try and piece it together really quickly.

278
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,880
And obviously, like, it was just so surprising. Like, obviously I can talk about it now because

279
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm not as like upset about it or like hurt. I'm kind of like, so is, but I feel comfortable

280
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,920
enough to talk about it now, but obviously I can fucking talk about it another day.

281
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,640
Order garbage collection on the computer, which that's me.

282
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,800
I thought that, I don't know. I read that as a Pregnation.

283
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,800
I think there's a Zura tweeted out that she's going to do M-Pregs soon and I'll,

284
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:05,640
no, not M-Pregs. Sorry. The other one. The other one. The other one. Order?

285
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,320
Trash, order? I got...

286
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,600
I just get haunted by...

287
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:25,400
Uh, get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out of here. How do I beat him up? Oh my God.

288
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,720
How do I beat up a child? Oh my God. I'm actually getting... Are you serious? How do you beat a

289
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,560
child up? I don't care if it's against the law. I'm coming out swinging. I'm actual coming out

290
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:44,280
swinging. Holy shit. I'll fucking, fucking curb stomping this child and forky. There's nothing

291
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:51,160
I can do. You can't beat him up. Are you serious? You can't beat him up. He's in... Uninteractable.

292
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,120
Are you serious? Open wade. That's right.

293
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:09,800
I'm sorry that you received Vile Maros over a misunderstanding. We refling support you always.

294
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:15,320
Oh, there's a card. Thank you, man. Right, no more... Am I getting attacked?

295
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,080
Did I just get attacked by a Cincada?

296
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,320
Right, I got a card. I don't know what they did. Oh, the city is in the distance.

297
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,160
Right, is there anyone... Oh no, please don't leave. Sorry. I was getting a bit distracted. Sorry about

298
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:46,520
the old... Right, ready? Like $46. Thank you. Wow, look at this car. It's clearly a Chevrolet

299
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:52,120
or something. I don't know what these are called. Hi, what are you? Oh, your garbage collection.

300
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,880
How do you beat up a child story? Real. Buy a roller in pain.

301
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Oh, wait. That was a timed thing?

302
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,360
Once equipped through tab, press shift to select a clore, any clore.

303
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,440
We'll do green. Right, where the fuck...

304
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,960
What am I doing? Oh my god, I was having to edge the wall.

305
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:36,120
I'm forced to paint. I'm forced to paint even though it's already painted. I can't just leave it.

306
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,880
Oh, press F. Oh, this is going to take a hot second. Hold on.

307
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:51,160
What kind of minigame is this? I know it's a... Bro, this is giving the... What role am I playing?

308
00:34:51,160 --> 00:35:00,200
The victim? This is painting. How have I got a minigame for that? What are you doing to that wall?

309
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:08,760
Honestly, I don't know. What is this? Am I just covered in paint now? I'm like...

310
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,840
It was the movie called, like, In Home Alone 2. One of them gets covered in paint, but I can't

311
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:23,640
laugh at the scene because if you look at his eyes, he very clearly either did have, like,

312
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:32,600
real paint on or something because his eyes are, like, so bloodshot red. And I wouldn't be

313
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,840
surprised if back in the old days, they never... I'm getting pranked by a freaking wheel. Are you

314
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:47,080
joking? Literally, there's this, like, meme and it's like, this is supposed to be a role-playing

315
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:54,440
game. What role am I playing? The victim? Because it's just, like, an absolute set. What? Who said?

316
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,520
Who said painting needed to be hot? Is this supposed to be, like, I'm so satisfied?

317
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:08,520
And so we're gonna keep it a Costco hotdog. That's how much it is to get access to the

318
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:19,800
area that our gas station serves. Actually, Ken Whit, we call it petrol, but for petroleum,

319
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:28,440
and you call it gas for gasoline, not to be confused with the hit Spanish word, gasolina,

320
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,080
which means... I think it means prostitute. I might have made that up, though. I didn't

321
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:43,880
speak espanol, so you'd know better than me. Eh, I'm afraid I've not been listening to enough

322
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:52,920
pitbull to know what it means. Oh, sorry. Do you? Don't you call it benzine? No, it's petrol.

323
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,640
Like, oh, I need to go get some petrol. Sorry, there's probably someone outside the shop right

324
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,440
now that's been waiting forever for me to fuel them up. Stop! You're getting ink everywhere.

325
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:15,400
It must be green. Okay. We're still going off! Still got boarded up planks on this as well.

326
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:25,800
How unprofessional this gas station, truly. But we're looking a bit more. Stop it.

327
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,360
We're looking... are you there? Hold on, let me get my hand out. Not to be confused with a hand out.

328
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,760
You're just doing the government assistance. You're not going to go over budget. No, I wouldn't

329
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,920
make you go over budget. You never asked for that. Okay, let's keep... let's keep... so benzine? What?

330
00:37:49,240 --> 00:38:02,280
What? No! I'm painting you the wrong floor. Hold on. Uh, what was it again? Was it tango?

331
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,960
Shift. Shift green. Okay. Not one random bit being white in the front.

332
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,320
Okay, no. Everything has to be green because we're squiddles. What's up here? Okay.

333
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,080
Actually, I'd probably just make the rest of it green.

334
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,600
White. And then...

335
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:40,760
Okay. Uh-huh. Oh yeah. Yeah, look at that skill. Oh my god, that looks... look, this is an accent in

336
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,640
colour, okay? It's an accent in colour. I think there's a car behind me right now.

337
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,160
I would love to serve you right away, but I need to get this. Aesthetics of this place sorted out.

338
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,280
As it tries to debate me on the wheel. Right, we're doing the post and then we're done though, okay?

339
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:07,400
What accent is the colour? Uh, Scandinavian because it's white question one.

340
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Wow. House flipper is this you? I've never actually played house flipper. It seems to be

341
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,600
like a really commonly played game, but... Well, I'd say it looks boring, but that's

342
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,840
hypocritical because guess what I'm doing right now? Probably the same core mechanics as house

343
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:31,000
flipper. So, can't he be chatting shite because I'm gonna get banged? I'm gonna get banged. I know

344
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,600
the good kind. I know the good kind with my eddy flints when we kind of like yelp at night.

345
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,080
What? Oh, it's a lamp. I thought that was CCTV. I was like, damn, we're back in 1984. Short and

346
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:57,960
behaviour. Absolutely short and behaviour. We did it! Okay, no more. Right, take my hand out.

347
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,920
And then...

348
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,640
Thank you, refling. See you later, alligator. And you go... Give it a little spank on your way.

349
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:20,920
Enjoy your journey, good sir. My good refling wife. Find the right tool to break into the car trunk.

350
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,720
A crowbar?

351
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,840
It was... There's another plane. Ooh, a plane. It's like when you come across a cow in a field.

352
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,600
I have a lockpick!

353
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,840
Please be like Skyrim or I'm gonna cry. Press AD to lockpick. Hold space bar.

354
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,960
Okay, it's like Skyrim. But does it sound like Skyrim?

355
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:59,960
Can't be open.

356
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,560
Has already opened it? Tangle? No. In my backpack, there's a dust bowl painting.

357
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:23,640
Favorite cell delete? Can I hang it up, maybe? Oh my gosh, let's... Oh my god, we'll make it a

358
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,360
conversational piece. So it's gonna go right there. Can I turn you off? You're so loud.

359
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:36,040
My little headset, my little gamer headset is too much. What's the most you've ever lost in a coin

360
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:44,600
toss? What's a coin toss? In a gamble? I don't know if you mean gamble.

361
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:55,800
Oh my god, refling stop. I like the green car. And you go... Everyone gets a spank at this location

362
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:04,440
when you go back and buy two shelves. Press left mouse button. Features, shelves of alcohol.

363
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,440
Let's do cola.

364
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:20,360
And then snap. Oh no, I messed up a little bit. Oh my god, that music's really annoying me.

365
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,560
Leave me alone. Is the shelves in here? Whoa, don't sell it, don't sell it.

366
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,520
Whoa, how do I rotate you?

367
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:44,760
Okay, I can't, I think it's... Q? Oh, geez, could you rotate any slower?

368
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:50,920
I mean, you have a grid like fashion, wouldn't it not just be easier to like maintain the grid?

369
00:42:51,560 --> 00:43:02,920
Okay, and then, well, I'll take that. Okay, buy additional. Please stop. I don't want to use it.

370
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,160
It's so loud. It's so loud in my ears. Please leave me alone.

371
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:17,000
We play both kinds, country and western. What's this? Buy? I count before you clear the area.

372
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,720
No paint for the inside? Oh, and I've even thought about that.

373
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:34,520
Wait for the customer's order. Welcome to Rebecca's gas station. And today, we're doing this customer.

374
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:42,360
Oh my god, no, thank you. Right, how am I making like 50 quid every time one person show up?

375
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,040
Can I ask? I still need to clean this up more. I honestly thought we had finished, right?

376
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,040
What do I need to do?

377
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,400
Buying additional parking space. Right, where's Rudy?

378
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:09,160
Look for something yellow. Look for something yellow colored. Where is it? Over here, there is.

379
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Okay, that'll do. Over the heat of the Nevada sun. Okay, press F.

380
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,800
This music no more.

381
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,960
It's my pee.

382
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,360
I see you pee.

383
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,680
Remember when that was the most hilarious thing at? Press left, mouse button.

384
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:42,360
Right, and then reverse. The pipes are hot. Jeez, these things are overheating.

385
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:50,760
Look for something yellow in a yellow colored desert, honestly. Maybe go in a sentence and turn it on.

386
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,520
Or at least if I can turn it down.

387
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:11,320
Right, hold on. Options, audio, music, even more because you're taking the mince. I've had enough.

388
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,920
Right, is that only supposed to clean that one? Or did I clean the wrong one?

389
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,680
I know it feels too quiet.

390
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,600
Well, no, it doesn't because I'm right next to it. Feet yours. Other, a parking lot. What do I do here?

391
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:34,120
Bye. One, two, three. What does that do? Do people come in for supplies?

392
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:43,240
Answer the call from uncle? Uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle. Go men, I'm sorry I was late.

393
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,400
Hello. Hi. I see the business is doing well. Sometimes. I'm calling to congratulate you on

394
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,680
successfully taking it off the ground. What? You can't run a business on fuel alone. I've

395
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,880
had a few of my people deliver some extra stock for those empty shelves of yours.

396
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,800
Time to talk money. You now owe me. Well, I'll send you the invoice to your email.

397
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,800
Don't miss it. I'm sorry nephew, but there is just no room for charity in this world.

398
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:21,480
I hope you'll find it within your finances. You didn't buy this place. I've rolled up and bought

399
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:29,960
it myself. Persuasive methods of reimbursement. Don't have me wait too long now. Goodbye.

400
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:39,640
I have five minutes to pay off five thousand. Bruh, I'm going to be.

401
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:50,280
What? Wait, so he stalked my shelves for free and I'm the one that gets punished for it. What are you?

402
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,200
I don't know about us.

403
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,520
He's still, I'm going to see him.

404
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,120
Good afternoon.

405
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,080
Are you squiddin' me right now?

406
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,360
If you won't read Marshmallows for a bit, then it'll just say it here.

407
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,040
It's just until it looks over.

408
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,720
You're an amazing person. This was embarrassing to say.

409
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:25,320
Embarrassing? You're embarrassed to declare your love for me wink, wink, nine thousand? How dare you?

410
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,760
Wink, wink, more like you didn't buy anything?

411
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,040
Militing? You didn't buy anything? Or is this like a self-gunner?

412
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:41,560
Serve the customers at the cash register. I don't even know how to get inside the cash register.

413
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:48,680
I gave you stuff you didn't ask for. No, where's my money?

414
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,520
Actually, she never wanted anything.

415
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,320
Good afternoon.

416
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,960
Good evening, because it's actually after six o'clock.

417
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Are you out? You're out? Your engine's off?

418
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,520
Wait for the customers? Oh yeah.

419
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,520
I shouldn't have started that. No, it's literally the only thing my brain's going to be saying to the rest of it.

420
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,440
Yeah, yeah.

421
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,440
Is no one buying? Have I put the prices up too much?

422
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,680
Yeah. I'm going shop then, enjoy your shop.

423
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,520
Buy a bakery item to reward yourself.

424
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,800
Press F to pick up. What are you? It's just a club.

425
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,880
And now it's floating.

426
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:40,040
And why is it not allowed against this wall anymore?

427
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,920
We'll never know. We'll never know why it's not allowed against that wall all of a sudden.

428
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,680
Let's just pop it there, I guess.

429
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,680
Hi. I don't have... Why is no one buying? Can they not come in?

430
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:08,440
Oh. Is that bird shit? Oh. No. Oh no, I have to like...

431
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,880
I have to maintain the outside as well.

432
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:21,080
Okay, people ain't buying anything. I think I messed up the bone feature.

433
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,480
Am I supposed to go on it?

434
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,240
She put something down? She didn't.

435
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,440
Can you... Okay, you picked it up.

436
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,400
Uh-huh. How do I serve?

437
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,120
I'm going to serve this country.

438
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,840
What are you? The cash register.

439
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,720
Use shift in the belt and hold it.

440
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,880
Move products over the scanner and put them in the basket.

441
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,200
The belt will get dirty over time and slow down, clean it and hold it and make no mistakes.

442
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,880
What? Press...

443
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,080
I'm too small for this.

444
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,080
There's no products shown. Press F to quit minigame. Left shift.

445
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,600
Why?

446
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,600
Wait, how am I supposed to refuel cars and sell products like this?

447
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,120
Set up a delay. Oh, everyone act natural.

448
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,520
Everyone act natural.

449
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,080
Is that not sweet? Fine, you can have it for free.

450
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,400
Okay, I think I make way more money if people just take fuel.

451
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,720
So please just ask for fuel. That's great.

452
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,000
Cop founders.

453
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,920
It's the feds. Everyone behave.

454
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,680
How do I get in the toilet?

455
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,880
I must unlock it. I've got 11 seconds to make 5000.

456
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,000
Where did that come from?

457
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,920
I literally cautioned slippery when wet out of nowhere.

458
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,720
Excuse me?

459
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,960
You don't have to say that part out loud. I just want it in here.

460
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,120
I don't even know how to refuel for anything.

461
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,640
Are you a refueling? You're in all green.

462
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,680
Maybe Elvis gave it to you. Mommy failed to pay her debts and now she's owned

463
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,400
by the mob monkey.

464
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,960
Gava bun. It's a lot of life. I've only got two whole months.

465
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,320
Thank you for your extended membership.

466
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,640
I got a new emoteslaw.

467
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,240
I missed my actually drew that.

468
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,920
And then I put you on my head.

469
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,520
My emotes are coming soon to you.

470
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,440
Mercy to me and Acerus is the first.

471
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,720
Gaining?

472
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,240
Gil. Oh my gosh, you're actually using the...

473
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,640
Oh no, I'm going to have to actually empty it.

474
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,120
Have you not got any decency?

475
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,680
Elvis, you need to calm down.

476
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,800
This place is haunted.

477
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,160
Yeah, that's somewhat...

478
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,520
Elvis is feeling it.

479
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,120
You said put me back in for another one, chief.

480
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,800
Put me in for another one.

481
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:15,160
Yeah, ten dollar readers isn't really that much in terms of the gas station fuel.

482
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,680
Oh, I need to re-stock the fuel.

483
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,400
Uh, I can do that.

484
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,920
I remember how to do that.

485
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,360
Services? Not that one.

486
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,840
Home? More info?

487
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,440
Okay, uh, delivery?

488
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,520
Yo, do the math.

489
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,800
Oh, yeah.

490
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,440
Oh, yeah.

491
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,160
Merry Christmas.

492
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Okay, I'm not sure I'm digging the...

493
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,040
Am I being haunted by Santa?

494
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,480
I actually think I'm being haunted by Santa right now.

495
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,040
All yours.

496
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,680
Did Elvis laugh like Santa?

497
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,560
Yes, Santa's real.

498
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,760
You received a tip from a customer.

499
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,000
Aye, I'm not sure how I'm feeling about the...

500
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,320
I don't...

501
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,520
I don't make as much money if I'm on the tell.

502
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
I mean, I guess you make more money overall.

503
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,800
But no, the mafia owns me.

504
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,520
This is, like, the worst of both worlds.

505
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,320
Please don't look.

506
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,520
Sorry, it takes me...

507
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,560
It takes me a moment to figure out, like, they're all...

508
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,400
You think I would know after, like...

509
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,280
No, you know how that...

510
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:05,960
Where are you going?

511
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,360
No? Okay.

512
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,480
Are you just feeling a bit confused, are you?

513
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,200
I believe it.

514
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,080
I'm not eating.

515
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,760
You just do your thing, doll.

516
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,880
That was really random.

517
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,960
Is that why they kept walking back out randomly?

518
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,480
Who is littering?

519
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,160
Litterbug.

520
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,280
Okay, he's about to come here.

521
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,280
Oh, you have to go to work.

522
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,800
He just slams the tip on the counter.

523
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,680
Can you increase prices, as they say?

524
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,880
I think they might be so.

525
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,200
Oh, gosh, I'm going to say something contrary.

526
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,320
How do I connect the nozzle?

527
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,160
How did I do it last time?

528
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,000
It just, like, came out of nowhere.

529
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,200
Mm-hmm.

530
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,560
Wow.

531
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:53,960
E.

532
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,160
You'll never guess what it's E.

533
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,040
Oh, God, what are you feeling?

534
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,520
Okay, there's someone...

535
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,720
You ate their mess,

536
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,200
because it's a lot quicker for me to do this one,

537
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,760
unless they're actually buying fuel.

538
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,240
And then...

539
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,440
One second, madame.

540
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:19,820
Me?

541
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:24,920
Wait, what?

542
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,440
I don't understand a bit, Lord.

543
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,600
Can you blow up the oil tanker?

544
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,920
Unfortunately, I don't have a cigarette available.

545
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,720
He's already going.

546
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,280
I didn't know oil tankers even looked like a shuttle bus.

547
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:37,720
Like...

548
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:40,280
Hey.

549
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,720
Hey.

550
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,600
Can I blow this up?

551
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,000
Hold on.

552
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,480
Let me...

553
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,680
Oh, my God, I'm going to emmy this,

554
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,640
like, in her lore video.

555
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,680
I'm adding a little pipe bomb

556
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,960
into it, a little surprise for him

557
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,000
in about 10 minutes' time.

558
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,680
Answer the phone call?

559
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:55,880
Hurry up.

560
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,480
What?

561
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,880
One, we're not even on the same freaking axis.

562
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,760
I got beaten up?

563
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,040
I didn't really like my uncle that much,

564
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:18,600
can that?

565
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,100
What?

566
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,320
You get beaten up in your own place of residence?

567
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,200
Why would I say that?

568
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,600
A loan shark got you?

569
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,720
A loan shark got you?

570
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,920
I like the PNG that continued with the cigarette.

571
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,200
Uncle, long time no see.

572
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,760
You fucking...

573
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,320
Wake up, Sam.

574
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,400
You got a gas station to run.

575
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,480
Uh, is that all he's going to say?

576
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,040
He's going to get me beaten up,

577
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,240
comes over in his freaking expensive Cadillac.

578
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,320
So my uncle's a bad man, huh?

579
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,280
Hey, nephew.

580
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,800
Back on your feet?

581
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,680
I hope your head's no longer spinning.

582
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,360
Thanks for picking up.

583
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,880
We need to talk.

584
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,320
There was a mistake, a serious one.

585
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:35,960
I have the high ground.

586
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,000
You can rest easy.

587
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,320
No, and I will have the responsible people

588
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,080
dealt proper retribution for what has happened.

589
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,880
Wait, so that wasn't one of his things?

590
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,920
The investment loan deadline was rendered far too short

591
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,280
for what the amount was.

592
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,680
It's plain bad business.

593
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,600
And I don't make bad business decisions.

594
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,000
Let's forget about this debacle for the time being.

595
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,600
As a token of apology,

596
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,680
please accept this small gift.

597
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,720
It will help with your next delivery.

598
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,240
No strings attached.

599
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:13,640
However, you will need to make the warehouse

600
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,720
operational again to receive it.

601
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,240
Somehow, you're a resolute lad.

602
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,000
You'll figure it out.

603
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,600
Did someone say goon?

604
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,600
It's like whenever you watch Batman

605
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,200
and or something like that and it's like

606
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,200
get on it goons.

607
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,000
And I'm just like,

608
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,280
I think the word has been changed so much.

609
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,400
It doesn't mean what it used to mean.

610
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,960
It only means one thing these days.

611
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,760
Bro, I feel like there's just so much.

612
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,680
I don't know how to replenish this.

613
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,160
Surely.

614
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,160
A delivery of restock is locked.

615
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,120
Tools?

616
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:56,760
An airbrush, a vacuum, a few manic.

617
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,560
A few manic hammer.

618
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,680
Upgrade.

619
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,520
Upgrade.

620
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,560
Unlocks the warehouse.

621
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,760
How do I get that?

622
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,760
Additional quest progression.

623
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,000
Gas station can touch this airstrip in party time.

624
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,720
Open closed specific sections of the gas station.

625
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,360
I'm tempted to close the parking spot

626
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,520
just so I didn't have to deal with the

627
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,680
which male

628
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,760
loan cash register alone again.

629
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,760
Oh, this is like summarizing

630
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,160
the plot that we're currently going through

631
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,480
because the game came with a plot random line.

632
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:39,800
Oh my god.

633
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:40,760
Hi.

634
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,320
Good morning.

635
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:45,720
Oh, hello.

636
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah.

637
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,280
Yeah.

638
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,560
Press right mouse button.

639
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,720
Are you squiddin' me right now?

640
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,080
What did I just do?

641
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,640
You owe my money and she breaks your kneecaps

642
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,240
for being late on your payment.

643
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:11,640
Yes.

644
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:12,120
Yeah.

645
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:14,680
Thank you.

646
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,360
See, you're a nice resource.

647
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,160
The pretty lord.

648
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,840
Thank you for the super chat.

649
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,920
I wouldn't break knees.

650
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,600
Most likely just spitting mouths and stuff of that nature.

651
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,520
Landmark decorations bought.

652
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,800
How do you do that?

653
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,080
Decoration.

654
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,960
Landmark.

655
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,240
I'm to buy this?

656
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:36,760
Sure.

657
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,080
How strange of a clue.

658
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,920
But mommy, we don't have any news.

659
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,960
I'll break your beak.

660
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,720
Cool.

661
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,720
Good evening.

662
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,280
I like how I'm on day four of no sleep.

663
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,600
Can you go to sleep in this game?

664
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,480
You might be able to.

665
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,920
Are you squiddin' me right now?

666
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,880
This reminds me of this one time I saw this cute cashier

667
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,080
at a gas station and my voice cracked so hard.

668
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,120
Still keeps me up.

669
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,920
Oh, Riflin, no.

670
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,360
That's so funny.

671
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,960
I'm so sorry.

672
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,760
I'm so sorry.

673
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,560
I don't know why,

674
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,600
but voice cracks are the funniest thing ever to me.

675
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,880
I'm so sorry.

676
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,080
Lonely Kluzie.

677
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,240
Apologize.

678
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:31,720
That's so bad.

679
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,840
Shebe's like, count me in.

680
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,120
I'm beating them up.

681
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:37,160
I'm so sorry that happened.

682
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,760
And it keeps you up at night,

683
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,440
but that is really funny.

684
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,520
I don't know why voice cracks are like...

685
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,480
I don't think they're that much of a big deal,

686
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,920
but whenever there's like a clip,

687
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,360
it's like, no, excuse me, excuse me, type thing.

688
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,440
That's a skull.

689
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,600
Bro, don't let a customer catch me with this.

690
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,640
What the fuck?

691
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,240
Sorry, sorry for the confusion.

692
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,200
I'm getting a bit low.

693
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,320
I don't know how to restock.

694
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,160
Right, we need to figure out how to...

695
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,160
Oh.

696
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:15,560
Oh my.

697
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,600
I mean, I'll take it.

698
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,960
Oh my gosh, I got crazed.

699
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,800
I have been lip-raised.

700
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,600
That...

701
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,000
I'm gonna have to paint the exterior again.

702
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,840
I keep doing that and she's gonna be mad.

703
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,080
That's awful.

704
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,640
I dropped one item and you weren't charged for it.

705
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,880
Uh, literally.

706
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,240
How do you expand somewhere and then stuff just shows up?

707
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,600
That's not how it works.

708
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,080
That's not how expansion works.

709
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,640
What are you?

710
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,240
You're just a random cabin.

711
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,280
Get out of here.

712
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,160
Get out of here.

713
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,240
I can't even fit through the down door with you.

714
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,360
Literally.

715
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,720
Customer, I feel sorry.

716
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,720
Cool that I've owned.

717
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,040
When your voice crack, everyone notices

718
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:12,840
and you want to die on...

719
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,440
I almost overcharged her ridiculously.

720
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,840
And Elvis is leaving his stuff everywhere.

721
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,840
Honestly, literally, what is this?

722
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:25,080
Just random bits and bobs?

723
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,320
Press F to pick up.

724
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,000
Oh, I got a free decoration though.

725
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,160
Oh, I like that.

726
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,440
Fill trash.

727
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,320
Okay, and then do that one, I guess.

728
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,400
And then...

729
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,200
Then you'd be honking at me, sir.

730
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,480
Where are you?

731
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,200
Get back to you.

732
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,880
Okay, get my hand out.

733
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,040
Oh, there's not even anyone here.

734
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:55,960
Go schizophrenic.

735
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,680
Oh, I'm going to be dreaming.

736
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:05,560
I've been dreaming of a garbage disposal.

737
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:06,840
Press F to pick up.

738
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,840
Right, and then put you against the wall again.

739
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,640
And then where was that other bin bag?

740
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,720
Get this tire out here.

741
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,560
Customers are going to be wondering what kind of decoration scheme we're going for.

742
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,680
Random cute toolbox holder.

743
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,640
That's actually really nice.

744
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,520
It's made out of wood.

745
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,720
We do love a good...

746
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:29,720
Find a way to enter the warehouse and open it.

747
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,320
Hello?

748
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,200
What are you?

749
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:40,360
Be careful.

750
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,640
Keep your warehouse gate closed.

751
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,560
Otherwise, folk are going to steal from you.

752
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,560
I'm going to close it then.

753
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,000
Reset the...

754
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,600
Reset alien?

755
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:50,920
What?

756
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,040
Remove the haystacks to make the warehouse operational again.

757
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,000
Can you open?

758
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,000
This is going to take me a hot second

759
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,600
if I'm having to do all of these ones.

760
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,160
What's going on?

761
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,880
Look, all it says is remove.

762
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,840
I didn't say put them...

763
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,320
Nope, that's a seat going.

764
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:14,280
Nope.

765
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,200
I just did remove the haystacks.

766
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,400
I'm getting trolled by a door.

767
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,600
Stop closing.

768
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,560
Stop closing.

769
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,920
You're being so stinky.

770
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,400
Stop it.

771
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,040
Come out.

772
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,240
No.

773
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,480
It's too thick.

774
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:31,960
Stop.

775
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:33,560
Go.

776
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:35,160
Rotate.

777
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,520
Pivot.

778
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,320
Geez.

779
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,120
What is this fucking furniture move and simulator?

780
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:44,040
You have customers waiting.

781
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:44,680
No.

782
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,160
Hold on.

783
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,320
I'm mucking about with hay bales in the back.

784
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:47,640
Wait.

785
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,680
I'll fuck it.

786
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,000
Fuck it.

787
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,800
We have customers.

788
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,920
Refunds don't need to hire yet.

789
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,560
Oh my God.

790
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:53,880
Stop.

791
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:54,680
There's already two.

792
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:54,840
Right.

793
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,400
Let's do the gas first because they're the most money maker.

794
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,160
Okay.

795
01:06:59,160 --> 01:06:59,400
Okay.

796
01:06:59,400 --> 01:06:59,720
Okay.

797
01:06:59,720 --> 01:06:59,800
Okay.

798
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,120
Okay.

799
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:00,520
Boom.

800
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:01,880
Okay.

801
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,840
Oh thank you for your waiting.

802
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,400
Watch this.

803
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,120
Watch this scale.

804
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:07,960
Oh yeah.

805
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,080
Yep.

806
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,040
Uh-huh.

807
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,960
Tell them how you really feel.

808
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,000
Tell them how you really feel.

809
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,080
Okay.

810
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:15,560
Next please.

811
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:17,960
Oh yeah.

812
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:18,600
Keep that clean.

813
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,280
Tell us how you really feel.

814
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:22,920
Okay.

815
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:24,680
Okay.

816
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,400
We've bought some time.

817
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,120
Back to the hay bales.

818
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,800
That is a lot of hay bales.

819
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,120
Geez.

820
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,280
Think of the cows that could have eaten that.

821
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,760
Well someone please think of the cows.

822
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:34,920
Right.

823
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,560
Please get out.

824
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,040
Thank you.

825
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,760
How do I rotate this?

826
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,760
Come out with me.

827
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:41,000
There.

828
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,600
I'm just a shove against the...

829
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,200
Um.

830
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,560
Someone told you how cute your voice is.

831
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,440
My voice already allows me to get moving hay bales.

832
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,880
Oh or stuck or stuck.

833
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,360
Oh yeah.

834
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,160
Oh yeah.

835
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,200
Door stuck.

836
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:54,360
Right.

837
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,640
We're almost done surely.

838
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,320
Is this a Five Nights at Freddy's reference?

839
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,520
Or am I just making that up?

840
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,080
Have a really funny plot for Imi actually coming out.

841
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,920
I have no idea if she's gonna hate it though.

842
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,320
Fade out when she gets the square.

843
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,200
Do you want another plot?

844
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,400
Can I spoil it already?

845
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,600
Or am I not to spoil for me?

846
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:29,880
It's later.

847
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:32,840
Come on.

848
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:34,280
Come through.

849
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:35,880
There we go.

850
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,080
Leak it.

851
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:39,960
Um.

852
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,360
I wanted to do an in public kind of plot for Imi.

853
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,640
And I was like racking my brain what it should be.

854
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,160
Like I wrote it down in the notes and that.

855
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:57,160
And I was like how about you both at the cinema.

856
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,400
But you're watching FNAF 2 together.

857
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,000
She gives you the old gobby.

858
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,600
I was like yeah that seems on par for her.

859
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,360
Just trying to keep a secret challenge on possible.

860
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,680
I literally can't even come up.

861
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,680
Keep my mouth shut for like five moments.

862
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,440
Although I'm doing pretty well on the one thing that I can't spoil.

863
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,040
I'm actually doing rather well with.

864
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,280
Bomb head while watching FNAF honestly.

865
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,400
What happens on the roof?

866
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,920
Is an air vent?

867
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:34,120
Oh sir can you see by the dawn's air.

868
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,000
Right if I grab this.

869
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:38,760
Is this going to work?

870
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,320
Are you joking?

871
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:44,040
I've been making this so much harder than it needs to be.

872
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,920
I could have done speedrun strats.

873
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,160
You're making it so hard.

874
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,840
You mean nothing.

875
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,680
Optimization.

876
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,400
Real I'm sure.

877
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:01,720
There's beefing at me.

878
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,640
I keep you in brand and beefing.

879
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:06,920
Right now I've got $800.

880
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,560
What's this?

881
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,120
Warehouse.

882
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,200
Inventory capacity.

883
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,160
Fuel capacity.

884
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:14,280
Sure.

885
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:22,680
I started streaming 69 seconds ago.

886
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,720
Wait what?

887
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,440
Me?

888
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:24,760
No.

889
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,400
It's been an hour.

890
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,040
It's been in Deutschland.

891
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,840
Is the beefing someone waiting for fuel?

892
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:34,040
Maybe.

893
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:37,080
But sometimes they beef and they're not even there.

894
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,800
Maybe it's them approaching and it's like my head's up

895
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,480
that I'm about to need to serve.

896
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:43,640
Bunk.

897
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,160
Awesome.

898
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,800
Imagine getting a $5 to tip for literally pumping.

899
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,800
Wait do you tip for pumping gas?

900
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:55,000
No this cannot be true.

901
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,680
All right it's when someone pulls up to give you a heads up.

902
01:10:58,680 --> 01:10:59,640
Okay that's fine.

903
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:00,520
I can handle that.

904
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,760
Customers randomly going out back?

905
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,960
Right can I?

906
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,840
Okay I can finally...

907
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:15,080
What?

908
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:16,600
All...

909
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,840
Oh no.

910
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,400
Okay head a head send.

911
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:31,720
Is it gonna come?

912
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,720
I lost it.

913
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,120
Oh okay.

914
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:38,680
Okay.

915
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,840
Okay okay okay.

916
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,720
Stack up and then order.

917
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,920
Insufficient warehouse capacity.

918
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,520
Guess I'll go F myself.

919
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,200
How about now?

920
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,200
Sell too much.

921
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,680
How about now?

922
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,840
Okay let's start that again.

923
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:14,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

924
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,440
That's what I actually need.

925
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:19,240
Remove one order.

926
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,280
Right jeez.

927
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:21,640
Sorry.

928
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,560
Product please.

929
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,720
Thank you.

930
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,400
Love a good bit of praise on a Saturday night.

931
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,160
Bunk.

932
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:34,600
Mmm.

933
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:38,520
How would we rate this game so far is the real question?

934
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,320
How many squiddles for a bluit?

935
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:44,680
So uh I...

936
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,120
How would we rate it?

937
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,520
I don't know why but supermarket simulator had to...

938
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,960
It had like I thought it was a child stealing.

939
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,440
I was like bro I don't have the capacity to deal with this.

940
01:12:59,240 --> 01:12:59,640
Um.

941
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,200
A supermarket simulator was like way more addictive than...

942
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,280
Or is this one...

943
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,920
I'm not as majorly fussed for.

944
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,000
Is that controversial?

945
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,720
Uh one is exact.

946
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,000
Change while there's a tentacle.

947
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,920
Say no more good girl.

948
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,960
Don't answer yourself when the music's gonna do that for you.

949
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,720
You get yourself bagged you leave a tip.

950
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,440
You take...

951
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,880
You order takeout you leave a tip.

952
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,920
You're born as a guy.

953
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,880
You leave a tip.

954
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,480
Hold on.

955
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:37,800
Huh.

956
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,680
It only took me three months to get the applause sound effect.

957
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,480
Huh.

958
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:41,800
Right.

959
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,240
So I need to let him in.

960
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:47,560
Now.

961
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,760
Oh yeah didn't he run me over mate?

962
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,040
You can run the chair over that's not to do with me though.

963
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:57,640
It's what now.

964
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,520
I have to unload it!

965
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:03,800
Where?

966
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,840
Oh on the shelves?

967
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,600
Oh right isn't...

968
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:10,920
Wait.

969
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,360
Uh.

970
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,240
Is that gonna close as well?

971
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh he's tipping on his axis.

972
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:25,960
Jesus babe.

973
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,480
Gonna be our bumpy ride.

974
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:28,680
Can you close?

975
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,000
Okay it closes the other one as well.

976
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,720
I don't know what reset means okay.

977
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,840
I must be bugging?

978
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,120
I'm strange.

979
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,240
Calfish girl kidnaps you to our kingdom of warriors.

980
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,200
My win.

981
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,480
Real and true.

982
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,640
I found my super old script so...

983
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,160
I was gonna collab with Umi.

984
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,800
I'm both of us are gonna collab in another life.

985
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:59,880
And I found the script but it was ear licking and I had to see or I was like I'm so sorry I'm

986

1255
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,400
Oh, this?

1256
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,400
Can't grab it.

1257
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,400
Right.

1258
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,400
Uh...

1259
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:29,400
I'm like, I think we just release them. Look on the wall with the trash.

1260
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,400
Tires.

1261
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,400
Oh, they're right behind the thing.

1262
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,400
Okay.

1263
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:40,400
Eww, eww, eww, eww, eww, eww, eww, eww, eww!

1264
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,400
You know, for someone who is hired as a gas station attendant,

1265
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,400
this is rather out of my thingy.

1266
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,400
Right, that's the tire.

1267
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:51,400
So then what's the buffer?

1268
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:53,400
What buff?

1269
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:58,400
Trash doctor, okay.

1270
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,400
I'm just coloring in.

1271
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,400
Oh my gosh.

1272
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,400
Okay, right.

1273
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,400
That...

1274
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:11,400
That could have gone a lot worse.

1275
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,400
That could have gone terribly wrong, but it didn't.

1276
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:19,400
That's the main thing.

1277
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:23,400
I did not know you could do so much on this game.

1278
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:28,400
Right, we have unlocked all, like, three delivery sections, bro.

1279
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:33,400
Services, paint, and you can just hire someone to test things.

1280
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:36,400
Overall revenue, 3K.

1281
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,400
Gore?

1282
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:39,400
Hi, Gore.

1283
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:40,400
What?

1284
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:45,400
How are you first place at 11 seconds?

1285
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,400
Got it.

1286
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:48,400
That's not even possible.

1287
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,400
We're getting trolled.

1288
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,400
Right, we need more fuel.

1289
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,400
Can we do more?

1290
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,400
Not enough money.

1291
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:56,400
How not?

1292
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,400
I'm ordering the maximum on purpose.

1293
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:03,400
I know the fuel is low.

1294
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:04,400
And the car wash.

1295
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,400
There's a car wash?

1296
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:08,400
That'll do.

1297
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,400
That'll do, right.

1298
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,400
Delivery, fuel.

1299
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,400
Add $100?

1300
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,400
No.

1301
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,400
That much?

1302
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:27,400
There's a fuel pre-system in game?

1303
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:32,400
The government needs to...

1304
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,400
Whoa, that's bizarre.

1305
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,400
I did not expect that.

1306
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:42,400
I did not expect that to randomly have a subsidizing thing.

1307
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,400
I'm trying to keep this place clean.

1308
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:52,400
Everyone's making it so dirty.

1309
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:55,400
I think Shibi's actually about to do another stream.

1310
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:58,400
Unless the gorilla was her stream for today.

1311
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,400
I'm not sure.

1312
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,400
There's a lot of it.

1313
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,400
A car wash and an airstrip as well?

1314
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:07,400
All on the same map or on a different map?

1315
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:12,400
Because I hope I have enough fuel for you, sir.

1316
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,400
I do.

1317
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,400
Super.

1318
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,400
This game is like six in a trench coat.

1319
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,400
A gorilla?

1320
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,400
A giant gorilla.

1321
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:28,400
Just like in those old video games.

1322
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:33,400
I got no occasion Shibi's stirs is going to do doom.

1323
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,400
Damn, two and one.

1324
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:35,400
Wham, bam.

1325
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:36,400
Thank you, ma'am.

1326
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:43,400
Why is the litters not gallant?

1327
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,400
Customer, do this.

1328
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:48,400
No, no, nothing.

1329
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:49,400
I don't know.

1330
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:51,400
Unless I can like super fastly do this.

1331
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:54,400
I'll take one bikini care wash please.

1332
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:57,400
Bikini care?

1333
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:01,400
Am I allowed to be in a bikini outfit?

1334
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:03,400
I've got like a little countdown going prepared.

1335
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,400
Right, show me what's wrong.

1336
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,400
Wheels?

1337
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:08,400
The wheels on the bus go around.

1338
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,400
Right, let's get rid of that.

1339
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,400
Whoa.

1340
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:17,400
In the desert there is...

1341
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,400
I don't know what's going on in that bathroom,

1342
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,400
but you better get out in the next two minutes.

1343
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,400
I'm not cleaning up after that.

1344
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,400
I'm not cleaning up after that.

1345
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,400
Okay, and then you want new wheels?

1346
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,400
I can give you new wheels.

1347
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,400
Okay.

1348
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,400
Uh-huh.

1349
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,400
Strange.

1350
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:38,400
I think I'm bugging out a bit.

1351
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:40,400
And then put the new wheel on.

1352
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:42,400
Yeah.

1353
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:45,400
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

1354
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,400
I'm lightning McQueen.

1355
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,400
Nope.

1356
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:52,400
And then what other one is it, ma'am?

1357
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,400
Look at this one.

1358
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,400
Oh, jeez.

1359
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:57,400
The tread on that tire, ma'am.

1360
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:01,400
I'm afraid that's going to be $300.

1361
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:05,400
Mm-hmm, they'll never know.

1362
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,400
Is that everything for you, ma'am, for today?

1363
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:08,400
Yes, thank you.

1364
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:09,400
Right, okay, hold on.

1365
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,400
I need to put the fuel.

1366
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,400
Fuel, fuel, fuel, fuel with some blues.

1367
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,400
Press E, press E, spam.

1368
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,400
Oh.

1369
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,400
Wait, he puts the pump line in?

1370
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,400
So you're the one who's been taking forever.

1371
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,400
Who's put blood on the floor?

1372
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:23,400
Hold on.

1373
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:27,400
Why is there random blood on the floor?

1374
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,400
You're welcome.

1375
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,400
That better be a crisp packet, I swear.

1376
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:34,400
I'm not dealing with that.

1377
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,400
Good job.

1378
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,400
Thank you.

1379
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:37,400
Why?

1380
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:40,400
No, they modeled that after Elon Musk.

1381
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,400
Yeah, sorry, they modeled that after Elon Musk.

1382
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:48,400
I'm not taking it any other way.

1383
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,400
Not really, but...

1384
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,400
How can you work here?

1385
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,400
How can you work here?

1386
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,400
I'm a literal one-man army.

1387
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,400
Please relax.

1388
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,400
Please relax.

1389
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,400
Who's shitting?

1390
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:01,400
Right, who's shitting?

1391
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:06,400
Which one of you nasty fucks are shitting?

1392
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,400
Are you honking at me?

1393
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,400
Because it's no me.

1394
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:13,400
Okay, we have fuel again, at least.

1395
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,400
I touched it.

1396
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,400
Thumbs down?

1397
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,400
Is it really that bad?

1398
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:24,400
I wasn't paying attention, but was it really not, though?

1399
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,400
I'm 5K in debt to the mall.

1400
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,400
Please understand.

1401
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,400
Car parts delivery?

1402
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:31,400
Fucking hell!

1403
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:35,400
Do they actually have a whole...

1404
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:37,400
I'm already out of wheels?

1405
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,400
What?

1406
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:42,400
Great job!

1407
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,400
Great job!

1408
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:47,400
I am doing a great job, thanks for asking.

1409
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:51,400
Right, let's close the business and wrap this up.

1410
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,400
Right, get that light off.

1411
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,400
We're no longer open.

1412
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,400
Everyone go home.

1413
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:56,400
Close.

1414
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,400
The entire gas station is closed.

1415
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,400
Everyone go home.

1416
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,400
I like how the car...

1417
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,400
Wait, oh no, he's turning in.

1418
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:08,400
Did the people still want served if they were coming in?

1419
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:12,400
Whilst it was closing, is my question.

1420
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,400
Stop honking at each other.

1421
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:18,400
You're literally on the car park.

1422
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:24,400
You're under investigation for murder of who?

1423
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:27,400
I wonder if bodies decompose faster in the desert,

1424
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:31,400
because it's like all bugs and stuff.

1425
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:33,400
Right, so everyone goes home.

1426
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:35,400
Good.

1427
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,400
Oh my god, you're right.

1428
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,400
There is a car wash!

1429
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:42,400
So then, who or what is the air strip?

1430
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,400
The entire gas station is closed.

1431
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:47,400
Right, well I try not to embarrass myself this time

1432
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,400
and actually do the little race car thing.

1433
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,400
Then we'll redirect into...

1434
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,400
I don't think...

1435
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:55,400
Oh, it was this.

1436
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:56,400
Okay.

1437
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,400
Right, let's just take easy, okay?

1438
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:02,400
Let's do easy.

1439
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,400
Easy, steady.

1440
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,400
Oh my god, we're losing it.

1441
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:07,400
We're losing it.

1442
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:11,400
The turning on this is very strong.

1443
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:13,400
Okay, uh-huh.

1444
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:16,400
Yeah, easy.

1445
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:17,400
Easy on that turn.

1446
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:22,400
Okay, very strong turn and very strong turn.

1447
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,400
Just half it.

1448
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:24,400
Just half it a little bit.

1449
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:25,400
That's all you gotta do.

1450
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,400
Just half it a little bit.

1451
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:38,400
Okay, I did a much better job this time.

1452
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:39,400
Okay.

1453
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:41,400
Oh, no, no, don't lose it now.

1454
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:42,400
Don't lose it now.

1455
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,400
Come on.

1456
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:44,400
Come on.

1457
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,400
Easy.

1458
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:50,400
Slow and steady wins the race.

1459
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,400
I'm just following the curves.

1460
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,400
I'm just following the curves.

1461
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,400
Hold it together.

1462
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:00,400
We're going off-road a little bit, but that's okay.

1463
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:02,400
Let's stick to the path, okay?

1464
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,400
There's a reason the road has been carved out.

1465
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,400
Stick to the path.

1466
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,400
Stick to the plan.

1467
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,400
It's like the skill in.

1468
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:16,400
No, I'm not doing the ramp.

1469
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:20,400
I already know I'd be upside down by the end of it.

1470
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:25,400
14, 15, 16.

1471
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:33,400
And last but certainly not least, 17.

1472
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:35,400
Achievement unlocked.

1473
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,400
Complete the race.

1474
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,400
Aw, that's cute.

1475
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:41,400
There's a good little truck.

1476
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:44,400
You're a good little truck.

1477
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:49,400
I don't know if I got all the cards in the area.

1478
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:52,400
Right, so I went on the restart.

1479
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,400
Maybe there's like one more card,

1480
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,400
because I never got all the achievements for the cards.

1481
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,400
Only thing strongly murdered was my tentacle bouncing on it.

1482
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:03,400
Oh, that's so good, honestly.

1483
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:06,400
How did your tentacle die in the Great War?

1484
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,400
The Great War?

1485
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,400
Yes.

1486
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:11,400
And what kind of war?

1487
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,400
I couldn't have won.

1488
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:14,400
I was implausible.

1489
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,400
Wait, what?

1490
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,400
Is this out of, it is out of bounds.

1491
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:25,400
Wait, what does, what's the warning say?

1492
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:28,400
Oh, you'll be returned to the gas station.

1493
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:31,400
Currently in gas in a minute.

1494
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:33,400
I thought, oh, is this the last card?

1495
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:36,400
Dennis Fort.

1496
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:40,400
Wait, was that the, okay, that was the entrance.

1497
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:42,400
Sorry, that was the entrance.

1498
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,400
Wasn't it paying attention?

1499
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:45,400
You found a card.

1500
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:47,400
Are they getting achievements for all the cards?

1501
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,400
No, I guess I don't have them all.

1502
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,400
It died in the Great Clam War.

1503
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,400
Oh my God, yes.

1504
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,400
No, right, go back.

1505
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,400
Sorry.

1506
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,400
All right.

1507
01:57:57,400 --> 01:58:00,400
And I can't go across the road.

1508
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:03,400
Can I?

1509
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,400
I can go across the road.

1510
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:08,400
There seems to be a structure over here.

1511
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,400
Nope.

1512
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:12,400
Can't go there, right?

1513
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:14,400
But I don't have all the cards.

1514
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:15,400
I find that hard.

1515
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:18,400
Unless it's buried under sand.

1516
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,400
Maybe.

1517
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,400
No, that did get all the cards.

1518
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,400
Where's my achievement?

1519
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:24,400
Come on, give.

1520
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:27,400
I got all the cards.

1521
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:33,400
Well, let's see if we played the, that game.

1522
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:38,400
This is like a maze, a random maze for the mini-core.

1523
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:44,400
It's like a terrible game of golf right now.

1524
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:45,400
That is Dennis's fort.

1525
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,400
Time to leave a massive jailbreak.

1526
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,400
Wait, why do we hate Dennis?

1527
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:53,400
Is that a reference to something?

1528
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:54,400
Okay, that's pretty fast.

1529
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,400
Right, let's go back to sleep.

1530
01:58:56,400 --> 01:59:00,400
We've not slept for six days, so let's go up here and close the door.

1531
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:02,400
Oh, we don't even have a door.

1532
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,400
Oh, that's nice.

1533
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:10,400
Let's just pop that right there.

1534
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:14,400
We'll kind of scooch that in all over there.

1535
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:20,400
Oh, we can't even, we're not allowed to sleep anymore?

1536
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:23,400
We're not allowed to sleep?

1537
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:27,400
Fine, I'll just crouch on the bed then.

1538
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:30,400
Golf with your friends, so lovers.

1539
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,400
He's the graffiti kid.

1540
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,400
Oh, they probably is.

1541
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,400
No, you're right.

1542
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:39,400
My technical dad kind of buried in your storage.

1543
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:44,400
The other cards might be later gas stations and like an area of it.

1544
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,400
No sleep, just work, literally.

1545
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:50,400
Oh my god, my wee mic's ready to come flying off.

1546
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:54,400
Please don't die, Mr. Microphone.

1547
01:59:54,400 --> 02:00:01,400
We breached through the strong gold, but the clam guard was too strong.

1548
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:04,400
You can't even sleep, it's just pure exploitation.

1549
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,400
It is, I don't know.

1550
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,400
Hold on, let me redirect him so she's straight.

1551
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:17,400
Yes, yes, yes, I'm gonna step on the gas tonight as well.

1552
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:21,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1553
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,400
Oh, I'm gonna have to find the link.

1554
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:26,400
Hold on, let me get a link for Sheevee's stream.

1555
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,400
What was she playing? What shoot was it today?

1556
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:34,400
I was watching her play Titanfall and I loved it so much, it was so cute.

1557
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:40,400
I watched the, near the end where it was the big mech-off, I was watching that.

1558
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:45,400
And she was doing so good.

1559
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:48,400
I looked like the Vod broke, but it definitely worked.

1560
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:52,400
Like the Vod, I can see 8 hours on Sheepster's Vod, so I'm not worried.

1561
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:57,400
I think it's all good in the neighbourhood.

1562
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:00,400
She's playing Doom.

1563
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:04,400
BFG, big fucking god.

1564
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:08,560
Touch-tash-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t

1565
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:16,640
Thank you, Unknownmiss, for the tip of effedency and reluctantly sung and Officer Gary.

1566
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,400
I'm really bad at saying everyone's names recently.

1567
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:23,400
It's such a bad streamer, you need spanking.

1568
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:25,400
All of a sudden I'm like, why, why are you limited out?

1569
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:32,400
I'm just like a nice little Cut-Off, and these Cut-Offes.

1570
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:47,000
The only thing they fear is you, rip and tear until it's done, plop plop plop plop rip and tear.

1571
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Get spanked, mommy.

1572
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,760
But the cup is here, it means enough.

1573
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:58,000
Did you see the short where I burped in your mouth and it was absolutely mingin?

1574
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,320
That's right, I'm forcing you to watch it whilst we stall so we sheepsters to come online.

1575
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:06,600
You're being forced to watch it.

1576
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:14,280
You're not ready for this, literally but it, oh no, it broke for me.

1577
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:19,720
I'm a burp right in your mouth, do I do apologize but please do open that some wide for me.

1578
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:21,720
There you go, that's spanked.

1579
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:25,200
Eee, you swallowed that, alright darling.

1580
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:32,520
I must have been playing, I must have been playing, how do you call it, BioShock.

1581
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:42,520
Because that's when I do the Atlantic accent, would you kindly let me take over your mind?

1582
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:46,520
I already commented on it, oh god, I should reply to comments when, hold on.

1583
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:51,920
As you wish, Johnny, you don't have to apologize, give a little, a little, a little part.

1584
02:02:51,920 --> 02:03:02,120
And I'll put, I aim to please, and then a little, a little blush emoji, I aim to please blush emoji.

1585
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:13,720
Love this new technique for CPR, I think the, the base in the burp would really help restart the heart.

1586
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:23,920
Exclamation mark, that's like only the third most disgusting thing Johnny's ever done to us, oh no!

1587
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:30,120
Oh it's two, what is two and one, question mark.

1588
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:39,120
She said the magic word, okay, cheeky sorry and everything is good to go.

1589
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:46,120
No, no, no signature on a con, convision, niggin, ooooh, convision.

1590
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:51,120
What, the, the flame thrower's are a legal piece of paper, that one.

1591
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:54,120
What, I can't even say that word.

1592
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:59,120
The flame thrower piece of paper where it says you're not supposed to burn people.

1593
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:02,120
I've, my brain is not having it.

1594
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:05,120
Number one will be the peeler relegation.

1595
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,120
I did declare that burp was a bit fishy, honestly.

1596
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:12,120
You can smell the soup, you're not!

1597
02:04:12,120 --> 02:04:14,120
No.

1598
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:16,120
Thank you Mume, there's a lot of thanks.

1599
02:04:16,120 --> 02:04:18,120
Thanks for the meal.

1600
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:24,120
I, well, I, da, tacky moss, and then I do a little pretty emoji.

1601
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:26,120
Are you squidding me right now?

1602
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:33,120
By the way, listened to the Scottish succubus audio last night and oh my god,

1603
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:35,120
Morgan Anseland herself would be proud.

1604
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:37,120
You actually, you liked it?

1605
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:41,120
Thank you Odin Yakuji, you liked it?

1606
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:45,120
I thought it was a bit shy, so I thought it was a bit shy, mate.

1607
02:04:45,120 --> 02:04:49,120
The Geneva Convention, that one.

1608
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:51,120
You did tacky moss.

1609
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,120
Oh, I'm glad you liked it.

1610
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:56,120
It's a little bit rubbish about it, but hey Ho,

1611
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:00,120
it just goes to show if you think it's rubbish, other people might not.

1612
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:04,120
Like you judge it as harsh because you're the one making it.

1613
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:13,120
So I was just, have some sprite, I'm going to say I should do the sprite separate challenge at one point.

1614
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:18,120
You know, I think I said this, from my debut I was originally going to do the sprite challenge,

1615
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:22,120
but then I didn't because I was too scared.

1616
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:26,120
That people would hate me for it.

1617
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:30,120
Both were amazing, loved the Billy one.

1618
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:35,120
You did tacky moss.

1619
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:39,120
Please don't thank me.

1620
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:41,120
What's the sprite challenge?

1621
02:05:41,120 --> 02:05:45,120
You basically chug an entire sprite,

1622
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:51,120
and you don't burp until you burp burp.

1623
02:05:51,120 --> 02:06:01,120
Can I hold up part two? Can I pull it out?

1624
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:13,120
No, it's doughnut stacking for part two.

1625
02:06:13,120 --> 02:06:18,120
Yeah.

1626
02:06:18,120 --> 02:06:22,120
Challenge accepted. To be honest, I like the kissing and Billy doughnuts.

1627
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:24,120
Cheeky bit of doughnut.

1628
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:26,120
Me? Doughnuts?

1629
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:31,120
Oh, this is scared not me.

1630
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,120
I want to find out how many doughnuts.

1631
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:37,120
I don't know how.

1632
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:43,120
I don't know how.

1633
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:47,120
Strongly the booby builder.

1634
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:51,120
That's funny as fuck.

1635
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:56,120
That's funny as fuck.

1636
02:06:56,120 --> 02:07:02,120
Booby is slang for your tentacle in Scots.

1637
02:07:02,120 --> 02:07:05,120
That's hilarious.

1638
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:12,120
I don't think I've taught you that, but yeah, Scottish slang booby means tentacle.

1639
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,120
I agree with that.

1640
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:19,120
The succubus and the glooming audio are tied for my favourite audio.

1641
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:21,120
Oh, really?

1642
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:23,120
Why do you think I named myself this?

1643
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:26,120
Okay, that's funny.

1644
02:07:26,120 --> 02:07:29,120
Thank you, Groomed by Veeler.

1645
02:07:29,120 --> 02:07:31,120
We need to decide.

1646
02:07:31,120 --> 02:07:34,120
We're going to write the script for next month together.

1647
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:36,120
I was taking a look at my notes.

1648
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:43,120
After December, roughly, is when we can start fully writing the plots together.

1649
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:48,120
Like, for the full month.

1650
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:52,120
Yeah, based username checks that I see your manual culture.

1651
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,120
I want to get going too.

1652
02:07:54,120 --> 02:07:56,120
Everyone's welcome.

1653
02:07:56,120 --> 02:07:57,120
Your booby broke?

1654
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:59,120
No, your wee booby.

1655
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:01,120
Aw, did you fire a wee bit early?

1656
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:03,120
A wee bit too early for mummy?

1657
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:05,120
Aw, your poor booby.

1658
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:07,120
That must be so.

1659
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:09,120
A wee bit raw?

1660
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:13,120
Yeah, would be a shame if mummy kept put.

1661
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:22,120
I love those memes that are like, when you inked but she keeps sucking and it's like...

1662
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:27,120
And then the image is like something like an outer body experience or something like that.

1663
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:31,120
But isn't that just P-O-T?

1664
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:35,120
Like, a potted plant, codenamed potted plant?

1665
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:38,120
Isn't that just P-O-T?

1666
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:42,120
But via, you know, a tongue and stuff?

1667
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:43,120
Question mark?

1668
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:49,120
Isn't that not what all those memes are?

1669
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:51,120
When Scoob licked all the peanut butter...

1670
02:08:51,120 --> 02:08:54,120
Wait, what?!

1671
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:57,120
Off your jinkies but he keeps on zoinking?

1672
02:08:57,120 --> 02:09:02,120
Oh my gosh, like zoinks Scoob!

1673
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:03,120
Oh no.

1674
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:05,120
I mean, some people like that.

1675
02:09:05,120 --> 02:09:06,120
You haven't seen that meme?

1676
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:07,120
No!

1677
02:09:07,120 --> 02:09:11,120
Wait, I don't know if I want to type it in.

1678
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:13,120
Oh wait, I'm going to pull up the image.

1679
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:15,120
Too early for...

1680
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:17,120
Too early.

1681
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:20,120
My for mummy.

1682
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:22,120
Sounds questionable to me.

1683
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:23,120
I'm so sorry, Broly legend.

1684
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:26,120
I absolutely just like destroyed that.

1685
02:09:26,120 --> 02:09:28,120
I destroyed that sentence.

1686
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:32,120
Wait, I'm going to pull up the meme.

1687
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:33,120
What?!

1688
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:34,120
Right, okay, hold on.

1689
02:09:34,120 --> 02:09:35,120
Let me show it on screen.

1690
02:09:35,120 --> 02:09:36,120
Give me a second.

1691
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:38,120
Give me a second.

1692
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:40,120
I'm checking it twice.

1693
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:44,120
I'm trying to see who's not here nice.

1694
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:48,120
Cause Sandy Claws is coming.

1695
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:55,120
Where is it?

1696
02:09:55,120 --> 02:10:00,120
This is the meme.

1697
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:03,120
That is awful.

1698
02:10:03,120 --> 02:10:05,120
That is awful.

1699
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:06,120
No more.

1700
02:10:06,120 --> 02:10:07,120
No more.

1701
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:08,120
These are awful.

1702
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:09,120
I should...

1703
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:10,120
Oh my god!

1704
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:13,120
I should do a meme review stream!

1705
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:18,120
Oh my god, you have to send me like your memes?

1706
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:24,120
Oh my gosh, and I have to rate them?

1707
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:26,120
I didn't mind doing a stream like that.

1708
02:10:26,120 --> 02:10:27,120
I've just entered.

1709
02:10:27,120 --> 02:10:28,120
What the fuck?

1710
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:29,120
Honestly, I was so sorry.

1711
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:32,120
Your timing is awful.

1712
02:10:32,120 --> 02:10:36,120
This is me and Mumme.

1713
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:38,120
Are you kidding me right now?

1714
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,120
That's fucking foul, honestly.

1715
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:41,120
That's fucking foul.

1716
02:10:41,120 --> 02:10:42,120
Broly legend.

1717
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:43,120
Thank you.

1718
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:45,120
Oh, Brian, even Brian's saying it too.

1719
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:46,120
Meme review.

1720
02:10:46,120 --> 02:10:47,120
Viola meme or random memes?

1721
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:48,120
I would say random memes.

1722
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:53,120
I feel like there's not enough Viola memes going around.

1723
02:10:53,120 --> 02:11:00,120
I was thinking of doing that meme that I did in another life where it's like Spider-Man

1724
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:04,120
is like slowly walking and he's upset, but I was going to do it about like me and the

1725
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:07,120
gang, like get a new version of it.

1726
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:09,120
I was going to do that.

1727
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:14,120
Thinking audio, Mumme wants her fix and we give it to her, but it's been too long between

1728
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:18,120
sessions and she keeps going cause she needs more.

1729
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:20,120
Oh my gosh!

1730
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:33,120
Okay, so not to get political or anything, but I read a manga about a cute little technical

1731
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:37,120
thing and it was, bro, it was so cute.

1732
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:43,120
I want to get one of the panels of us.

1733
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:49,120
So not to get political or anything, but it was so cute and I loved it so much.

1734
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:55,120
Now I want to get, now normally I wouldn't freaking touch this subject with a 10 foot

1735
02:11:55,120 --> 02:12:05,120
pole because I'm like, oh it's not for me, but in it the wee technical made her look pregnant

1736
02:12:05,120 --> 02:12:10,120
and I really liked the scene and I was like, oh no, what's going on here?

1737
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:12,120
Oh no, this can't be.

1738
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:17,120
I was like, am I gaining a new special interest?

1739
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:25,120
So I'm not sure, I'm going to, the artist that I've been working with that she's like

1740
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:27,120
absolutely fantastic.

1741
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:34,120
She's actually going to be drawing something, I don't want to foil it, but you already know

1742
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:37,120
what it is, if that makes sense.

1743
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:43,120
Yeah, but once she's done with that, I'm going to commission my anime one where I'm foot stomping

1744
02:12:43,120 --> 02:12:51,120
you with blackmail and then I'm going to commission that panel shamelessly and it's going to be you

1745
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:59,120
because in the manga it was literally you because you can extend your arms and that,

1746
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:02,120
get preggers with gen 2 honestly.

1747
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:08,120
We can make this a reality when Stoney's climbed all the ink from your tentacle but

1748
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:11,120
she keeps on plop plop plopping, honestly.

1749
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:18,120
I love how her Scottish son dairy has a weakness for cute things.

1750
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:20,120
I love it.

1751
02:13:20,120 --> 02:13:25,120
Given Mummy Soda and having her bones on your tentacle, shaking her up and every time she burps

1752
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:29,120
she grips, that's a diabolical plot.

1753
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:31,120
I'm going to need 13 of them right now.

1754
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:35,120
I'm going to need 13 of those plots, that's amazing.

1755
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:40,120
Going to give us the pregg bus scene.

1756
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:42,120
I liked it, okay?

1757
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:44,120
I don't know why I liked it.

1758
02:13:44,120 --> 02:13:45,120
I liked it.

1759
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:47,120
It was really cute.

1760
02:13:47,120 --> 02:13:49,120
Breeding gen 2 is why R&B has so much potential.

1761
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:53,120
I mean it's happening, it was going to be an old audio on Twitter.

1762
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:56,120
I'm not going to put it behind a paywall or anything like that.

1763
02:13:56,120 --> 02:14:00,120
Had there been an update on the chicken soup meme?

1764
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:03,120
I'm still debating on it.

1765
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:08,120
I'm not going to force it if my brain's like, I really don't want this out type thing.

1766
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:16,120
Not that it's like bad or anything, but maybe I'll do a different thing.

1767
02:14:16,120 --> 02:14:23,120
Honest, thank you basically Wiz.

1768
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:25,120
I can see that happening.

1769
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:33,120
I actually commissioned an artwork of three reeflings with me.

1770
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:41,120
I bought a few artworks in advance to do an event.

1771
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:44,120
However, this new artist, I really like her style.

1772
02:14:44,120 --> 02:14:49,120
I think my little mini event's going to cost like $3,000 or something.

1773
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:51,120
But it's going to be so worth it.

1774
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:56,120
I'm going to be cheeky and see if she's willing to let me cut the head off of the artwork

1775
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:59,120
so I can use it in YouTube roleplays as well.

1776
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:01,120
That's six tentacles.

1777
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:03,120
Yeah, an event.

1778
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:05,120
Yeah.

1779
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:09,120
I like doing stuff for you and fun little treats and that.

1780
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:11,120
But I think it's going to cost a pretty penny.

1781
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:18,120
But it's my, you know, I work hard hopefully to do it well.

1782
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:20,120
Yeah.

1783
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:26,120
And I'll see what happens, but I'm looking forward to it.

1784
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:28,120
What about the tentacle shop?

1785
02:15:28,120 --> 02:15:39,120
I remember it being a bit better, but when I first started being a curator of the forbidden, you know, panels,

1786
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:43,120
tentacle was like up there, but it is coming back.

1787
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:47,120
Like I wasn't really, it was like my number one and then it fell out.

1788
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:52,120
But it's like definitely climbing again because of you, Evelyn, basically.

1789
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:55,120
I'm getting back into it again.

1790
02:15:55,120 --> 02:16:00,120
There's this VTuber that's popped up and she sometimes comes up on my feet and she has tentacle,

1791
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:03,120
not enough from Hold Alive, this new one.

1792
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:06,120
And she has tentacles like coming from her back and that.

1793
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:14,120
And I'm just like, I want my alt model like right now where it's very clear that you are, you know, doing your thing.

1794
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:19,120
Like I want your tentacles like wrapped around my thighs and legs and my tummy and that.

1795
02:16:19,120 --> 02:16:24,120
Like, oh, I can just picture it now and it's going to be freaking glorious.

1796
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:27,120
It's going to be glorious.

1797
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:33,120
But I must, I must wait and I must try and I must behave.

1798
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:36,120
Tentacle and Joy are starting up.

1799
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:38,120
Mommy likes their tentacles.

1800
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:42,120
I only know three VTubers with tentacles outside of Halo.

1801
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:44,120
Outside of Halo.

1802
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:47,120
Halo Live announces their new concert.

1803
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:49,120
With Master Chief.

1804
02:16:54,120 --> 02:17:02,120
No, I've been watching her because I think her design was a pre-made, but it was really beautiful.

1805
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:07,120
I don't know what kind of content she'll make, but it was stunning, loved it.

1806
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,120
I've been enjoying seeing her pop up.

1807
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:11,120
We get to cling on to you on the alt model.

1808
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:13,120
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1809
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,120
Brian, don't say that!

1810
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,120
I can only get so hard.

1811
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:21,120
Brian, you're not supposed to say it out loud.

1812
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,120
The Buttey Lord, thank you for the five.

1813
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:26,120
Literally.

1814
02:17:26,120 --> 02:17:30,120
Halo Live, real.

1815
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:32,120
Halo Infinite Stream.

1816
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:34,120
You want to play Halo Infinite?

1817
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:37,120
I'm probably going to end up playing the Halo, so...

1818
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:42,120
Sheevie is interested in playing shooters.

1819
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:44,120
And I am going to...

1820
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:47,120
I basically was like, please play Halo with me.

1821
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:50,120
I would love to play Halo with you because it is multiplayer.

1822
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:56,120
We've got Portal 2 on the card, so I can keep up my puzzle game meme.

1823
02:17:56,120 --> 02:18:01,120
Because Sheevie hasn't played Portal 2, and I'm like, oh my god, I played it, so we'll zoom through it.

1824
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:03,120
Surely I'm not going to completely forget all the rooms.

1825
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:07,120
I'm going to completely forget, and we're going to have to try and actually do it for real for real.

1826
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:08,120
I warned her.

1827
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:11,120
I said the full stream is probably five hours if you want to do it in one big block,

1828
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:15,120
or if you'd rather spread it out.

1829
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:17,120
Co-op campaign.

1830
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:21,120
What about the tentacle that goes and hooks your mouth?

1831
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,120
Eh?

1832
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:25,120
What, you want me to commission that?

1833
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:27,120
I commissioned...

1834
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:29,120
I might as well, actually, you know what?

1835
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:32,120
Don't be surprised if I just start spamming tons of stuff on the alt Twitter

1836
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:36,120
to show you what I've been sitting on for ages.

1837
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:40,120
Because I commissioned a ton of cute stuff of us together.

1838
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:43,120
I have one where we're holding hands,

1839
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:47,120
but it's like lude because you're a tentacle,

1840
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:49,120
and I'm like, ah, hand-holding is so lude.

1841
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:51,120
I'll need to make it.

1842
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:53,120
Mytica's hot.

1843
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:55,120
There's art in the vault.

1844
02:18:55,120 --> 02:19:02,120
So I knew what you looked like maybe...

1845
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:08,120
Maybe eight months ago?

1846
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:10,120
I knew what you looked like.

1847
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,120
I knew what your name was.

1848
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:17,120
And let's just say the temptation to order artwork of us,

1849
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:20,120
doing stuff and all that, it was too much.

1850
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:25,120
It was too much.

1851
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:29,120
So I've got loads of stuff of us.

1852
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:32,120
We were born eight months ago, honestly.

1853
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:37,120
What about an audio of you being so busy with the lure

1854
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:40,120
that you don't have time to spend with your reeflings?

1855
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:43,120
You let us scrape you as an apology.

1856
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:48,120
A reefling? You're not supposed to say that part aloud!

1857
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:53,120
Thank you, Group Bavila.

1858
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,120
I would have to be very cautious with the words.

1859
02:19:56,120 --> 02:20:01,120
How about we say the use of free?

1860
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:03,120
How about that? The use of free instead?

1861
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:06,120
So how about...

1862
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:10,120
Wait, do you want Shibi to be in the background

1863
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:14,120
and I'm actually talking about work stuff

1864
02:20:14,120 --> 02:20:16,120
with Shibi being like, here's these strategies.

1865
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:19,120
I think if you do some of this stuff,

1866
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:22,120
and your shorts are doing fantastic, you're doing great.

1867
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:24,120
And then all you hear is like, plop, plop, plop.

1868
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:26,120
And then Shibi's on the other side, like,

1869
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:29,120
mushy, mushy, what's that noise in the background, scrawny?

1870
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:33,120
And I'm just like, oh, it's nothing!

1871
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:39,120
I think, do you have to ask,

1872
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:43,120
I feel like Shibi would be down for something so silly like that.

1873
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:47,120
This is a banger, and I know bangers!

1874
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:49,120
Please!

1875
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:52,120
She'd be into it, she'd laugh so hard.

1876
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:55,120
You can also make it a de-interest.

1877
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:57,120
That would be so good.

1878
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,120
I'll see, I'll see.

1879
02:20:58,120 --> 02:20:59,120
We'll need a bit of time to cook,

1880
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:02,120
because Shibi's actually doing some really good stuff

1881
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:04,120
coming up soon, TM.

1882
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:06,120
Which is not, I can't believe it.

1883
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:10,120
It's not my place to leak what she's doing.

1884
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:12,120
Doing it live.

1885
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:15,120
I don't think I would get it live in the...

1886
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:17,120
So I record in an audio booth.

1887
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:20,120
I'm actually going to show you my audio booths for my donathon.

1888
02:21:20,120 --> 02:21:25,120
One of the rewards is like my, my buck-ass POV of how I record.

1889
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,120
Call and ask her.

1890
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:29,120
You want me to call her right now?

1891
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:32,120
I can't call her right now, she's trying to stay upstream.

1892
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:40,120
Shawnee, when she can leak insider information,

1893
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,120
literally type in like,

1894
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:44,120
sad Spider-Man walking away gif.

1895
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:49,120
That's literally me when I can't leak absolutely everything that goes on.

1896
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:52,120
Like when Umi came in to chat,

1897
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:53,120
and she was like,

1898
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:55,120
I can't hold stuff in either.

1899
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:57,120
I'm like, she understands.

1900
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,120
She gets it.

1901
02:21:58,120 --> 02:22:00,120
Do it, do it.

1902
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:02,120
What, you want me to call Sheepster?

1903
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:04,120
I'll message her.

1904
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:07,120
Uh...

1905
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:12,120
The reeflings want me to call you for a proposal.

1906
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:14,120
Uh...

1907
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:16,120
Pre-re-o-pe-o-zo, but...

1908
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:19,120
Oh no, this is dead off.

1909
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:21,120
Oof.

1910
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:32,120
I've messin'.

1911
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:36,120
Uh...

1912
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:43,120
Uh...

1913
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:45,120
I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

1914
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:53,120
Uh...

1915
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,120
I think she's...

1916
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:57,120
Yes, yes, what the ID...

1917
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,120
Ears fall through.

1918
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,120
Oh wait, did she say...

1919
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:05,120
I think Sheep is having connectivity issues.

1920
02:23:05,120 --> 02:23:07,120
Hmm.

1921
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:10,120
Oh, wait, Tor.

1922
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:14,120
Uh...

1923
02:23:14,120 --> 02:23:16,120
Oh, she's yapping!

1924
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:18,120
Oh my God, sorry, let me delete it.

1925
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:19,120
Oh my God, let me delete it.

1926
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:20,120
She's on Twitter.

1927
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:21,120
She's doing a space on Twitter.

1928
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,120
Sorry, reeflings.

1929
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:25,120
I don't know, so can she not?

1930
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:26,120
Is she having connections?

1931
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:29,120
I think she's having a major connection, I think.

1932
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:31,120
Sorry, sorry.

1933
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:35,120
Uh, hopefully she didn't read that or else.

1934
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:37,120
I'm in mild trouble.

1935
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:39,120
I don't want to interrupt her if she's doing something.

1936
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,120
I don't know what's been on her...

1937
02:23:44,120 --> 02:23:45,120
Whipsies!

1938
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:49,120
I don't want to distract her if she's doing something like that, let's see.

1939
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:53,120
Right, yes, she's on Twitter right now in a space if you want to listen.

1940
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:54,120
Uh...

1941
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:56,120
I don't know if I can redirect into her then.

1942
02:23:56,120 --> 02:24:01,120
Well, I will redirect into her chat, but is she cancelling?

1943
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:04,120
Can someone ask if she's cancelling?

1944
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:07,120
Because I'll redirect into Emma's...

1945
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:12,120
Cross-platform raid?

1946
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:14,120
I don't know if that's even possible.

1947
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,120
Amy be heeee!

1948
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:23,120
E-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

1949
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:29,120
Uh, Amy's playing Wizard 101?

1950
02:24:29,120 --> 02:24:30,120
What is this game?

1951
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:32,120
Wizard 101?

1952
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:37,120
Play Wizard 101 today.

1953
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:41,120
It's a 2008 massively multiplayer online role-playing game

1954
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:45,120
developed and published by King's Ayo Entertainment.

1955
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:52,320
Players take on the role of student wizards who must save the spiral, the fictional universe in which the game is set from various threads.

1956
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Is it baby world of warcraft?

1957
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:58,880
I love the game.

1958
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:00,800
She's having internet issues right now.

1959
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:01,360
Aww.

1960
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:02,880
You don't know what wizard want to want it?

1961
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:03,760
No, I'm sorry.

1962
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,960
Is it like spore and everyone knows it?

1963
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,600
It's basically the child version of why-

1964
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:11,600
Okay, if you say it like that then yeah.

1965
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:13,520
Aww.

1966
02:25:14,480 --> 02:25:16,480
There's like koala bears in it and stuff.

1967
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,040
And an hour?

1968
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:20,880
An hour?!

1969
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:23,840
Oh my gosh, I have a DM on Twitter.

1970
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:24,640
I'm getting so scared.

1971
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:32,640
I'm getting scared.

1972
02:25:32,640 --> 02:25:33,760
I'm getting scared.

1973
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,960
Oh my gosh, it's another Vtuber.

1974
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:40,960
I'm gonna ask her for a cheeky ASMR club.

1975
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:42,480
If she's down, of course.

1976
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:43,520
If she's down.

1977
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:49,040
Wow is the child version of wow.

1978
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:50,400
One over.

1979
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,040
She said I heard wow on my ears.

1980
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:55,840
Perrie's out!

1981
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:00,160
I say carry me in wow but I don't understand what's going on half the time.

1982
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:01,280
I'm just here for a good time.

1983
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:04,720
Ask her for an ASMR club.

1984
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:06,720
Don't deliver the lines for six months.

1985
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,800
Honestly me, I feel really bad.

1986
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:13,600
So Poseidon from Mythos sent me her lines ages ago

1987
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:15,760
and I've been needing to record the stock sounds.

1988
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:18,080
Like the stock sounds, no.

1989
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:20,720
The actual sound effects that are written into the script.

1990
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:25,440
But the problem is, it's been so fucking windy

1991
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:29,920
that my bloody boost doesn't hide the wind sound.

1992
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,720
So it's like even inside the damn thing.

1993
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:33,200
So yeah.

1994
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:37,120
And here goes Mummy looking for collabs.

1995
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:38,720
She's looking for Pokemon.

1996
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:43,120
I'm really happy when someone reaches out to me and asks for one

1997
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:46,160
because I hope folk don't think I'm taking the pispy and like,

1998
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,920
oh you're a beach over with the 3DO.

1999
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:51,040
But I don't know.

2000
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,920
I feel like I'm just so direct and forward like that.

2001
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:57,520
I just hope folk aren't like, oh my god, Stroney's so weird about it.

2002
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:00,560
But I don't know how else I'm supposed to go around it.

2003
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:03,040
Like Yumi was really nice and reached out to me.

2004
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:09,840
And she was like, I heard Stroney wants to do like ASMR collabs

2005
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:12,160
and I'm like, fuck yeah, let me add you the fuck.

2006
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:13,680
Let me write that whole damn thing.

2007
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:18,640
Oh my god, is that, is that the real Yumi lurking in the shadows?

2008
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:20,240
Real, real?

2009
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:22,800
Is that the real Yumi?

2010
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:25,440
I think it is as well.

2011
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:27,280
No, sure, that's actually you.

2012
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:28,880
It fucking is you.

2013
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:32,000
Right, that's the Yumi that, wait, hold on.

2014
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:36,240
Let me give you a spanner so we can actually see you.

2015
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:37,200
Because you're hidden.

2016
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,320
You're so hidden.

2017
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,000
I'm a lurker, I feel bad chatting.

2018
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:40,480
Lomo.

2019
02:27:42,160 --> 02:27:43,360
It's the Yumi.

2020
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:45,680
So she's a demon girl.

2021
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:47,760
Right, hold on.

2022
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:49,760
Add as a motor here so we can actually see you.

2023
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:57,120
Um, Yumi, I think you're actually the first person out of 20 planned

2024
02:27:57,120 --> 02:27:59,920
collabs to ask me, which is really nice.

2025
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,640
It's actually really nice.

2026
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:07,040
So yeah, Yumi ASMR now, average Johnny Collab.

2027
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:11,280
It kind of is though because I, you know, I don't even want to be like

2028
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:16,160
fucking around with someone like making small talk when it's not enough,

2029
02:28:16,160 --> 02:28:21,360
not in a rude way of being like not taking the time to invest or learn about

2030
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:23,520
someone because I do look at people's content.

2031
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,600
I do look at them and that before I message them.

2032
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:29,440
And I was scared to ask you, but I'm so happy I reached out.

2033
02:28:29,440 --> 02:28:30,640
Thank you.

2034
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:32,960
And Mummy's reputation is growing.

2035
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:35,600
Having someone that asks, literally, I don't want to,

2036
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,960
the reason why I do it so directly is I don't want to waste anyone's time.

2037
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:42,640
I don't want to be like, oh, you need to learn about me before you

2038
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:43,440
collab about me.

2039
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:46,080
You need to, you know, XYZ Elemental P.

2040
02:28:46,080 --> 02:28:48,720
No, I'm like, hi, I'm Johnny from Veiler.

2041
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:52,880
You know, I saw you have, you do ASMR streams.

2042
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:54,720
I was wondering if you would like to collab.

2043
02:28:54,720 --> 02:28:55,680
I'll write the script.

2044
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,200
I'll edit it, all that jazz.

2045
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:00,640
And that's it.

2046
02:29:00,640 --> 02:29:02,160
That's literally how I communicate.

2047
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:04,480
And either, you know, you get what you want or you give.

2048
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:06,240
Don't get what you want.

2049
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:10,640
So Shibi's going to try and stream again in a bit from what servers are down

2050
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:12,160
and she'll try and stream at around 8 p.m.

2051
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:12,960
Is it Tuesday?

2052
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,880
Wait, how are servers are down for Doom?

2053
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:20,720
No ASMR is Mega Man's there.

2054
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:27,440
Well, Yumi, actually Yumi, I'm leaking her DMs.

2055
02:29:27,440 --> 02:29:30,720
So Yumi said something that made me think she doesn't have a 3Dio

2056
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,280
and I was about to post the water white meme, like,

2057
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:35,840
falling over like, you don't have a 3Dio?

2058
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:39,040
Oh no, because I only, I only want to collab with a 3Dio

2059
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:41,440
because that's how it sounds like much better than like,

2060
02:29:41,440 --> 02:29:43,920
versus like, if someone was using an SMB or whatever.

2061
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:45,920
It's Wednesday.

2062
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:48,560
What happens on a Wednesday?

2063
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:53,040
Crazy how lots of underground streamers are coming out of the woodwork to work the wheeler.

2064
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:57,120
I think people are nice about us, like,

2065
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:01,440
so obviously a lot of management's agencies, like,

2066
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:04,400
tell them not to interact with us because of the public perception,

2067
02:30:04,400 --> 02:30:05,680
which is fine, I respect it.

2068
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:07,760
It's not, you know, don't hate the player, hate the game type thing.

2069
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:13,040
But like, obviously indie v-tubers that do their own thing,

2070
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,000
if they want to associate with us, they can associate with us.

2071
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,240
It's not a problem, like, you can hang out at any time,

2072
02:30:18,240 --> 02:30:18,640
you know?

2073
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:22,800
Wait, what?

2074
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:25,360
Is there a DDoS attack going on?

2075
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:26,880
Am I about to be booted offline?

2076
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:30,000
Oh, so everyone's getting updated?

2077
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,640
It could be Shibu's villain or a v-roo-o-o.

2078
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:34,720
Eh.

2079
02:30:35,680 --> 02:30:36,480
Huh.

2080
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:38,240
I'm picking my lip right now.

2081
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:39,040
I said what I said.

2082
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:41,600
I love a good lip picking.

2083
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:42,640
That's just so good.

2084
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:48,880
Did we dare look at Marshmallows?

2085
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:49,600
I'm scared to.

2086
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:55,200
Without picking your lip, but it's so, it feels so pleasurable, okay?

2087
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:58,160
Sorry, you don't have a 3D.

2088
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:58,960
I can't collab with you.

2089
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:01,120
Collaborate with KU100 crying.

2090
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:03,920
Bruh, she would completely, like, and just,

2091
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,160
that's just her collab at that point.

2092
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:08,240
I'm going to speak, like, one sentence, and I'm going to be like,

2093
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:10,320
please, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy this girl.

2094
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:11,280
KU100?

2095
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:14,960
I don't understand why that is.

2096
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:16,960
It's not like you guys are a litany person.

2097
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:17,920
It's just perception.

2098
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:24,640
Like, obviously, the first thing most people probably saw was

2099
02:31:24,640 --> 02:31:28,880
the first AVTuber company, EnglishTuber company type thing.

2100
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:34,080
So, I completely understand why I'm not pissed around him like that.

2101
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:36,640
Like, it just says that it is what it is.

2102
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:39,600
Your lips seem dry.

2103
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:40,240
Let me fix that.

2104
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:40,640
Pucker up.

2105
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,120
I'm still picking, sorry.

2106
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,040
Check the marshmallows and laugh for a bit.

2107
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:49,680
What made me really push the barrel and reaching out?

2108
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:51,520
I wanted to before, but I thought I'd get ignored.

2109
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:53,040
Was the collab you did with them, Paul?

2110
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:54,720
Oh, the alien one?

2111
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:59,600
What I like to do is write the ASMR collabs,

2112
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:02,160
either related to the girl in some way,

2113
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:06,560
or if they have previous ASMR stuff,

2114
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,880
I try to incorporate what their most popular plot is.

2115
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:13,200
This girl was really kind and collaborated with me.

2116
02:32:17,440 --> 02:32:18,960
She agreed to do ASMR,

2117
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:20,800
but she actually does ASMR roleplays on her side.

2118
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:23,920
And one of them was Lovebombing, a type of roleplay.

2119
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:27,200
And I was like, because you're this,

2120
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:29,920
do you want to do a Lovebombing type of plot together?

2121
02:32:29,920 --> 02:32:31,120
And she was like, fuck yeah!

2122
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:35,920
And she was just happy because I was incorporating stuff

2123
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:38,640
that she had done before and that was successful.

2124
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:40,880
Because obviously I want the success of the video

2125
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:42,480
and the collab partner gets shown off

2126
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:45,520
and I get to, you know, get a little bit closer to them,

2127
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:46,560
my goals and stuff.

2128
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:50,880
They're scared of catching cooties from the Shlife, honestly.

2129
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:53,040
How do I find the alt Twitter?

2130
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:56,800
I think I'm just called strongy...

2131
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:01,120
Not safe, really?

2132
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:01,920
I can't remember.

2133
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:03,760
Big dub for indie YouTubers.

2134
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:05,600
Yeah, like it's really nice

2135
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:08,160
how many people have agreed to do collabs with me.

2136
02:33:08,320 --> 02:33:12,400
Um, because there's now a third editor on board,

2137
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:15,120
I'm actually really happy.

2138
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:20,960
I've got two ASMR milestone videos coming out.

2139
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:24,880
The next collab is with Poseidon.

2140
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:27,120
I just need to record the sound effect.

2141
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:28,400
I'm feeling cheeky though,

2142
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:31,520
because I saw Shibi got a bowl with wooden balls

2143
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:32,960
to like make soup ASMR.

2144
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:34,480
So it's going to be a lot better than mine.

2145
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:36,880
And I'm tempted to be like,

2146
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:40,400
oh Shibi, do you like even more work on your play?

2147
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:43,280
What sold me was the Sonic Tizm,

2148
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:44,640
if I'm being brutally honest.

2149
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:47,360
Sonic Heroes.

2150
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:50,240
I didn't even know Sonic Heroes had that hidden end in Yumi,

2151
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:51,520
so if you've not played it on stream,

2152
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:53,280
I heavily recommend it.

2153
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:54,960
I'm not even that good at Sonic

2154
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:58,240
because I'm not very skilled at it,

2155
02:33:58,240 --> 02:33:59,360
but even I could do it.

2156
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:01,600
So it went fantastically astic.

2157
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:03,840
Oh no, Shibi DM'd me.

2158
02:34:04,720 --> 02:34:08,720
Oh no, she sent me the rock!

2159
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:15,600
I was going to ask for a quick voice chat for...

2160
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:22,480
Oh my God, I'm sweating.

2161
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:23,840
I feel like I'm in trouble.

2162
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:29,680
And I saw you were in Twitter space.

2163
02:34:34,480 --> 02:34:45,680
Oh no, oh no.

2164
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:01,840
Okay.

2165
02:35:04,480 --> 02:35:19,120
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm getting scared.

2166
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,440
How am I even going to phrase this?

2167
02:35:21,440 --> 02:35:24,320
Oh hi Shibi, would you like to be on the other end of an audio

2168
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:26,080
where the reeflings are shagging me?

2169
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,360
How else do I phrase it?

2170
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:33,040
Hello, hello Shibi.

2171
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,920
Why yes, it is I, Strony.

2172
02:35:42,640 --> 02:35:43,520
Hi Shibi.

2173
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:45,920
Hello, we can hear you.

2174
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:46,560
How are you?

2175
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:48,560
I'm, I'm mad.

2176
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:50,640
Oh my freaking internet.

2177
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:52,080
I'm so upset.

2178
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:55,040
Your internet, her internet shit in the bed?

2179
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:58,320
Yeah, like, you know how when I was in call with you

2180
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:00,720
and Mercy the other day and our stuff,

2181
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:03,280
just like I just kept like not being able to hear anything.

2182
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:05,200
Disappear in for like five minutes.

2183
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:09,680
Yeah, I'm like, they're just like having a whole conversation

2184
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:11,680
and I'm like, what did you guys say?

2185
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:14,160
I said, can you repeat that for the back of the class?

2186
02:36:14,160 --> 02:36:14,560
Thanks.

2187
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:18,640
What do the reeflings want to know?

2188
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:23,920
Um, we have a question that's rather unique

2189
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,840
and we've embarrassed that.

2190
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,640
Are you asking me on a date?

2191
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:29,360
Cause it's yes.

2192
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:31,120
Oh, oh, okay.

2193
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:32,560
Oh, I mean, I'll take it.

2194
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:38,000
We have a date on portal too, actually.

2195
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,960
I've already, I'm sorry, I already leaked it.

2196
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,640
Forgive me, I'm not worthy.

2197
02:36:44,480 --> 02:36:50,080
I was wondering if in theory I were to create a scripts

2198
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:54,560
where the reeflings were helping me with stress relief

2199
02:36:54,560 --> 02:36:59,680
whilst I may or may not be giving you content creator advice

2200
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:00,640
in the background.

2201
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:04,400
And then basically you kind of go, huh, Strani, what's going on?

2202
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:08,000
You're making some weird noises and I'm like, nothing.

2203
02:37:10,560 --> 02:37:12,400
You want me to be cocked over the phone?

2204
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:18,240
A wee bit, a wee bit if you say it like that.

2205
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:21,680
Oh my God.

2206
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:26,240
If I, if I wrote a wee silly gooberino of a script like that,

2207
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:29,120
do you think you'd be down to be on the other side?

2208
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:29,760
Yeah, sure.

2209
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:31,600
We can do it right now.

2210
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:33,840
I could be like, what are you talking about?

2211
02:37:34,400 --> 02:37:36,480
Strani, what, I think you're breaking.

2212
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:37,360
What's that noise?

2213
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:40,400
You're like, pure, pure, pure, pure, pure.

2214
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:46,560
Sorry, I'm just, I'm just caught talking something the last now.

2215
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:51,680
Oh, sorry, I just stubbed my toe hand, didn't you worry?

2216
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:54,880
Did you worry about me?

2217
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:55,760
Oh my God.

2218
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:57,760
Okay, that's a yes.

2219
02:37:58,640 --> 02:37:59,840
Holy fuck.

2220
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:01,520
10 out of 10 for Shibi.

2221
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:03,120
Right, let us bring to the internet.

2222
02:38:03,120 --> 02:38:05,680
God, she can boot up because I'm redirecting into that.

2223
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:06,560
Yes.

2224
02:38:06,560 --> 02:38:08,640
Oh, I hope fully.

2225
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:09,680
I hope it works and like.

2226
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:11,680
Are you doing like speed tests and stuff?

2227
02:38:12,640 --> 02:38:20,800
I just like, I, it, everything looks normal.

2228
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:22,560
Stuff just keeps falling off.

2229
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:25,600
Like my whole entire last part of my Elden Ring stream

2230
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:27,840
just completely lagged and bugged out.

2231
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,800
I don't know why.

2232
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:32,240
And that's why I think it's like something's going on in my building.

2233
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:36,240
Well, some of the reeflands we're seeing servers are getting updated

2234
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:38,320
in other places of dust interwebs.

2235
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:40,000
I don't know if maybe you're like,

2236
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,640
because you're a region lock, then maybe it's having.

2237
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:43,520
Maybe.

2238
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:45,600
Like maybe it's like just little hiccups.

2239
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:48,640
Perhaps.

2240
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:51,120
Hopefully it goes away.

2241
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:52,560
It seems like it's fine now.

2242
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:56,240
Well, literally you've not lagged for a little second.

2243
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:58,240
Yeah, I'm like, hello?

2244
02:38:58,800 --> 02:38:59,200
Is it safe?

2245
02:38:59,200 --> 02:38:59,760
Yeah, I know.

2246
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:01,120
I don't know.

2247
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:02,480
Are you still in Twitter space?

2248
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:04,640
Did it lag out at all on Twitter?

2249
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:07,520
Oh, no, I'm on 5G right now on Twitter.

2250
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:09,040
Oh, dumb ass, of course you are.

2251
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:13,120
Because why would you randomly have an ethernet cable plugged into your mobile phone?

2252
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:14,240
Yeah.

2253
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:15,200
That would be impressive.

2254
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:18,240
That, yeah, technology sure has come a long way.

2255
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:22,720
But yes, right.

2256
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:27,760
I am going to thank you for even entertaining something so ridiculous.

2257
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:29,840
I'm always down to clown.

2258
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:31,360
I hope, yeah.

2259
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:38,320
And I'm going to go and then stall and see if we can get you up,

2260
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:40,080
because I would like to redirect into you.

2261
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:42,480
Okay, okay.

2262
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:43,600
I'll try.

2263
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:45,360
I'll talk to you later, alligator.

2264
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:46,960
Okay, bye.

2265
02:39:46,960 --> 02:39:47,680
Bye, bye.

2266
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:54,320
Yeah, I'm so fucking embarrassed.

2267
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:56,000
I'm so fucking embarrassed.

2268
02:39:56,800 --> 02:39:58,080
Oh, hey, Sheebie.

2269
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:02,400
Would you like to be fucking on the other side of the microphone?

2270
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:04,080
Bruh.

2271
02:40:04,080 --> 02:40:04,400
Hi.

2272
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:04,960
Hi.

2273
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:07,840
Please, I'm balling my eye.

2274
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,120
What does that even mean?

2275
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:11,600
I think Amazon servers hosting is having problems,

2276
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:13,600
which is affecting all these different locations.

2277
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:20,160
I can't believe my joke of an idea just created this masterpiece of a script.

2278
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,480
Did I cook or did I fucking cook?

2279
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:26,640
You motherfucking cooked.

2280
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:28,160
I sure you motherfucking cooked.

2281
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:35,520
Uh, baby, you're the greatest time of my life.

2282
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:36,640
Thank you, Grimdy Bealer.

2283
02:40:36,640 --> 02:40:41,120
Yes, as I said, I'm always open to the content that you want to see.

2284
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:46,560
Please don't ever be like, oh, I'm not having anything.

2285
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:47,840
I don't know.

2286
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:51,120
That amount of money I would pay to see.

2287
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:53,680
My face is red like a freaking tomato right now.

2288
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:54,640
I'm not even kidding.

2289
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:57,760
Hey, Sheebie, can you sit in that chair for a second?

2290
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:58,640
Just for a moment.

2291
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,600
I like how innocent she is.

2292
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:02,880
She's like, are you asking me on a date?

2293
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:07,520
And I'm like, uh, kind of if you want to think of it like a video.

2294
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:16,000
But yes, I, as I said, I'm always open to that stuff.

2295
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,440
I prefer making content you actually want to see than taking a stab in the dark.

2296
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:25,360
So I have roughly 10 ASMRs to upload.

2297
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:29,920
And then I'm going to start doing what you guys want me to do for the milestones.

2298
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:36,320
Hey, Sheebie, please listen to us doing the deed, basically.

2299
02:41:37,360 --> 02:41:38,960
More embarrassed than mommy.

2300
02:41:38,960 --> 02:41:39,760
I'm morphed.

2301
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:42,320
It's a date if you're into it, Tim.

2302
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:45,280
A date, but she's the third wheel.

2303
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:48,800
Is she the third wheel or is she the third thingy?

2304
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:53,120
I think how I'll do it is I'll start it off and she is in the call.

2305
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:57,200
And then eventually she hangs up and then I start getting fricking raging at you.

2306
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:03,120
And I'm like, because you guys seem to want me to shout at you angrily in my accent in

2307
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:04,800
audios.

2308
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:09,920
So I think what we'll do is we hang up, like means she be hanging up.

2309
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:14,080
And then basically I'll whip around and give you daggers.

2310
02:42:14,080 --> 02:42:17,600
And I'm like, what the fuck are you playing at?

2311
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:19,200
But then obviously I'm enjoying it.

2312
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:23,040
So then I keep getting angry.

2313
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:26,160
Another thought is she figures that out and starts teasing you too.

2314
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:35,280
The collabs didn't do how I expected, like I predicted them to do.

2315
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:44,400
So in the audio role play VA world, it's actually really good when two people

2316
02:42:44,400 --> 02:42:47,600
collab together because it's like, oh my god, really exciting that these two,

2317
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:51,200
these two forces have come together to fight in the same team.

2318
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:55,440
Um, I missed the mark with the VTuber side of it.

2319
02:42:55,440 --> 02:42:58,320
And I was like, oopsies, whoopsies.

2320
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:01,520
So I'm probably not really going to do that too much.

2321
02:43:02,480 --> 02:43:04,080
Oh, hey, our game is on pause.

2322
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:05,440
We're on day eight.

2323
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:07,520
How are we doing gas stations in there?

2324
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:11,120
Am I just starving at all times?

2325
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:14,720
Feels like I'm just starving at all times.

2326
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:16,720
Starving Marvin.

2327
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,520
I'll let you look at something a wee bit different in the background.

2328
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:25,680
How about with some blabbing away?

2329
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:29,040
This turned into a script writing stream.

2330
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:30,800
Real and true, VA lord.

2331
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:34,560
I actually did really well in my last membership script writing stream.

2332
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,920
I'm like, don't you mind if I do?

2333
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:37,040
Don't you mind if I do?

2334
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:44,480
Um, yeah, happens the favorite part.

2335
02:43:48,880 --> 02:43:50,080
Then she grapes those.

2336
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:50,880
I grape you.

2337
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:56,160
I'm a great piece so hard.

2338
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:01,280
Uh, no, but as I said, I'm always like down to plan when it comes to that stuff.

2339
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:01,520
Right.

2340
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:03,280
I'm going to dare to look at Marshmallow.

2341
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:06,960
And before the first thing is like, oh, well, I'm triggered.

2342
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:10,560
Hi, strongers.

2343
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:11,680
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

2344
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:13,040
Get praise, get praise, get praise.

2345
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:13,520
Love you.

2346
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:14,000
Love you too.

2347
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:14,640
Are you filming?

2348
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:17,360
And uh, can you see can I?

2349
02:44:18,720 --> 02:44:19,520
Please artwork me.

2350
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:22,160
I don't know how we even got there.

2351
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:24,400
Now that I think about it, I'm like, how did we even get there?

2352
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:28,960
Oh my God.

2353
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:30,320
Oh, jump scared.

2354
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:32,160
Well, she bees up.

2355
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:34,160
She bees up.

2356
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:34,960
Are you ready?

2357
02:44:36,560 --> 02:44:37,280
Anonymous.

2358
02:44:37,280 --> 02:44:40,160
She be what are those wet noises?

2359
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:41,360
Mama nothing.

2360
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:43,040
What are those wet noises?

2361
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:45,760
What are those wet noises?

2362
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:47,760
Yeah, I think my microphone's bugging out.

2363
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:49,920
This is an older SMB, you know.

2364
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:52,240
Shawnee, we should play Black Ops 3 Zombies together.

2365
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:54,160
We can do Shadow of Evil.

2366
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:56,960
You may, you have more experience than that than me.

2367
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:59,440
I've not even played Zombies in Black Ops 3.

2368
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:01,040
Um, I'm not even kidding right now.

2369
02:45:01,040 --> 02:45:04,080
So you'd literally be showing me the ropes if we're doing that.

2370
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:06,560
If we're down to clown, I'm down to clown.

2371
02:45:06,560 --> 02:45:07,600
You just need to send me a DM.

2372
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:10,800
Right.

2373
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:16,800
I am going to prepare to redirect into she be my timbers.

2374
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:17,920
Any timberinos.

2375
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:21,040
So tomorrow, the agenda is actually a collab.

2376
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:22,320
Oh my God, I'm so social.

2377
02:45:22,320 --> 02:45:23,600
I'm such a social being.

2378
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:25,360
And I'm going to have to behave.

2379
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:28,560
I'm going to have to be respectful.

2380
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:33,120
Oh, I can't believe I'm always, I'm, I'm hopefully I'm always respectful.

2381
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:35,760
Anyway, you're taking my ASMR collab for Jennie.

2382
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:38,080
I'm taking your Zombies on Black Ops 3.

2383
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:40,880
Damn, I come back at the end.

2384
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:44,000
Yeah, it wasn't a long story today.

2385
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:45,040
Not long story today.

2386
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:47,360
Not long story today.

2387
02:45:47,360 --> 02:45:47,840
Okay.

2388
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:58,000
Ah, I'm gonna redirect into she be.

2389
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,280
She's currently a positive.

2390
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:01,680
I know like when she's a floating head right now.

2391
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:04,080
Is she strewn from her phone?

2392
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:05,840
I'm a floating head.

2393
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:07,600
Hi there.

2394
02:46:08,160 --> 02:46:08,480
Hi.

2395
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:13,120
Are we welcome to the void?

2396
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:15,520
I don't know what she's up to.

2397
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:16,960
I'm just let her do her shenanigans.

2398
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:18,800
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.

2399
02:46:18,800 --> 02:46:20,480
Noises aren't anything suspicious.

2400
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:23,920
Just making a nice cream pie filling over here.

2401
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:24,960
Thank you for this theme.

2402
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:27,040
Thank you for licking in the shadow.

2403
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:29,200
I don't think I did a Vod watcher reward.

2404
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:33,040
I don't, I don't recall.

2405
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:34,640
Right.

2406
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:35,120
I'm a...

2407
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:40,560
What is she doing?

2408
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:42,240
I don't know.

2409
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:44,080
I'm gonna redirect into she be,

2410
02:46:44,080 --> 02:46:45,920
but she has an internet connection issue.

2411
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:48,880
So please don't be too panicky if it doesn't work.

2412
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:50,320
The she be's testing some things.

2413
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:52,960
Even the truth she do is giving her the stinger with.

2414
02:46:52,960 --> 02:46:53,680
Oh yeah.

2415
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:54,880
Did you see the stinger?

2416
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:55,600
Are you ready?

2417
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:56,880
Are you ready for the stinger?

2418
02:46:58,240 --> 02:46:58,880
Whoa.

2419
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:00,880
Whoa.

2420
02:47:02,160 --> 02:47:03,520
Oh my gosh.

2421
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:06,240
I'm such a professional strummer.

2422
02:47:07,440 --> 02:47:08,640
Look at that.

2423
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,960
Look at that.

2424
02:47:10,960 --> 02:47:12,320
And that's not even the other one.

2425
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:15,520
My other one is doesn't even work.

2426
02:47:15,520 --> 02:47:17,520
There's a second one that doesn't even work.

2427
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:20,240
I'm so professional.

2428
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:22,960
I'm so professional.

2429
02:47:24,640 --> 02:47:25,040
It's real.

2430
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:25,440
Oh my god.

2431
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:27,360
Wait until I start doing my emotes as well.

2432
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:29,440
Wow.

2433
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:36,320
Oh my god.

2434
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:36,640
What?

2435
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:37,920
Oh my god.

2436
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:41,040
I just realized my head is being clipped off as well.

2437
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:44,320
So unprofessional honestly.

2438
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:45,600
You know what it is?

2439
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:47,760
It's a freaking beach of studio.

2440
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:51,200
Always wants to change its resolution or something.

2441
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:51,680
No.

2442
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:53,120
That's still getting clipped off.

2443
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:54,880
I didn't even notice that the entire stream.

2444
02:47:56,080 --> 02:47:58,080
Well, I'm off to pop my clog.

2445
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:00,080
And that's that.

2446
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:03,120
I'm gonna redirect into she be.

2447
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:05,520
I don't know what Shan Nanagan she's getting up to,

2448
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:07,920
but please enjoy her with your heart's content.

2449
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:12,000
I will see you tomorrow for a collaboration stream

2450
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:16,160
and then a membership stream afterwards.

2451
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:18,400
I don't know what we're going to do.

2452
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:20,160
I think it's members ace more.

2453
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:20,400
No.

2454
02:48:21,440 --> 02:48:23,440
I'm going to have to try harder.

2455
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:24,800
Ace has so far.

2456
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:27,920
Okay.

2457
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:28,560
I'll survive.

2458
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:30,000
Okay.

2459
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,360
Bye bye reflames.

2460
02:48:31,360 --> 02:48:33,200
I'll see you cutie but hoody some more.

2461
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:34,240
I'll give you my key.

2462
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:38,560
I'm only level three in gas station simulator,

2463
02:48:38,560 --> 02:48:40,000
so I can only give three kisses.

2464
02:48:46,080 --> 02:48:47,200
So a YAP stream.

2465
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:48,000
No.

2466
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,680
A tingle stream.

2467
02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:51,360
I promise it's a tingle stream.

2468
02:48:51,360 --> 02:48:51,680
Okay.

2469
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:54,640
I promise it's a tingle stream.

2470
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:56,640
There you.

2471
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:57,840
I'm going to tingle you so hard.

2472
02:48:57,840 --> 02:48:58,960
I'm going to tingle all over you.

2473
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:01,280
Right.

2474
02:49:01,280 --> 02:49:04,160
I am going to go and rest.

2475
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:06,880
I'm going to get sleep and then I'm going to wake up

2476
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:08,960
and then hopefully I'll have some ace more for you

2477
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:11,760
for two days in a boot.

2478
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:12,560
Okay.

2479
02:49:12,560 --> 02:49:14,000
Bye bye reflames.

2480
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,520
And you may if you're still lurking

2481
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:16,960
since you're too shy to type.

2482
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:19,440
Bye reflames.

2483
02:49:19,440 --> 02:49:20,320
I'll see you tomorrow.

2484
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:20,960
Bye bye.

2485
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:26,320
Love you.

2486
02:49:34,240 --> 02:49:34,880
Bye bye.

2487
02:49:34,880 --> 02:49:35,520
See you tomorrow.

2488
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:36,320
Enjoy Shabby.

2489
02:49:36,320 --> 02:49:37,280
Say hi to Shabby.
