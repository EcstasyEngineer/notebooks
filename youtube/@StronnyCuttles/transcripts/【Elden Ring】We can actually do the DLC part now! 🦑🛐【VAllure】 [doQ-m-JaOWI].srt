1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
so

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,000
someone goes about a vice of i'm my reaper with my conflict

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:34,640
Of course I see one she hates comment as I'm in the the click go live section whenever I go live

4
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
There's like a

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
Oh my short went up

6
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,720
Oh, Moe short went up. Oh my god

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,940
Hold on a minute hold on a minute. I just approved the release. Let's call me and hold on a minute

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
I wasn't supposed to have

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,600
Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. I'm currently in my YouTube comment section. I think I just had approved in a sus comment

10
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
That I may need to get rid of

11
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,360
Sometimes I actually approve a comment and I'm don't worry like I'm not insulted about it

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,160
But they mentioned another time that I was green and I'm like

13
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,440
I'm strong equals. I'm green. Let's leave it at that

14
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,120
Give one and get even good afternoon. How are you? You will give a rebee debris. We know we be you know

15
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
I did it

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,760
I

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,800
Had a short that came out. Oh my god, congratulations to me

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
And I

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
fricking

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
Finally I

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,080
Finally have a short and then I have a short coming out in four days and guess what I've finally edited the most a collab

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
I did I

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,760
Finally edited the most of the collab. I just need some title it and then I get up load it

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
and

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,320
As there is meme ASMR should be up right now if I'm not mistaken if I schedule that properly now

26
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,120
I do have absolutely horrific news and it's bad news for everyone across the board

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,320
So for those of you who weren't in the stream yesterday, please don't worry

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,760
It's absolutely ridiculous for a streamer to ask for 12 hours of your time. I am not insulted if you do not know this I

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
purposely took

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,960
Medicine to put me to sleep as soon as I went off stream I

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,920
Ended up staying awake another like what four hours

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,880
Maybe even five so I'm back to being exhausted didn't fix the problem

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,560
I woke up ten minutes ago. I'm shattered

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,920
But I think I can make it happen

35
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,600
Did you like the meme plot for and

36
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,480
If you haven't seen as there's meme audio is up and she keeps you dry with her boobies in the rain

37
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
And

38
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,800
Right today we're doing Elden Ring part two and then next week when next week starts. It's Elden Ring part three

39
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,080
However, I don't know if there's gonna be a pushdown and stuff if so

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Baltro will be an Elden Ring stream most likely and

41
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:06,200
Mecha salt will be wrecked as well to make way for Elden Ring because I don't actually know how much

42
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Contents up ahead so when the game says DLC my brain goes. Oh, it's something. That's 50 percent shorter than the main game

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,400
But some people are saying no this thing is who you mongous you mongous what?

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,960
So yes, it goes Elden Ring part three and then I do an AS the more stream

45
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,600
That's not my thing yeah, I

46
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,040
Fuck up that's not right

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,040
The ASMR stream should be for you. Why does it say 2 p.m?

48
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Unless that's EDT

49
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,040
Sorry, I'm gonna have to change that and my my delirium. That's not right

50
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,960
So it should be 4 a.m. ASMR stream at the usual time then two hours later

51
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,080
We're gonna do two hours of script writing. I'm gonna gauge interest

52
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm gonna gauge if people like it if people like it. We'll come back to it another time and then

53
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,240
I've been among us collab with Yumi plus and it's gonna be a zero mercy

54
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,440
She be and me versus in quotation marks Amy Mamosa

55
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,080
Rainy what the fuck that's about her name wrong. I

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,040
Have oh my god, this is what I see this is why you can't fucking make anything creative when you're like delirious

57
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
and

58
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,400
And then the next day supposed to be mech assault campaign mode mech assault is an old ancient xbox game and

59
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:58,240
It apparently is eight hours long and then I'm gonna make a membership ASMR after the eight hour stream

60
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,920
The time zones are right. They're in EST like the rest of your schedule

61
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:12,160
But where does it say that it doesn't say that is an EST that's the problem

62
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
I

63
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,240
Shouldn't know have like yes 9 p.m. EST and brackets

64
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,920
anyway, and

65
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:30,120
So if Elden Ring is complete then we're playing about row if we're not playing about row and mummies gamble in the house

66
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,240
Wait, yeah, if we don't if Elden Ring is finished

67
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,120
Then we're playing but we're gamble in the house. Look at the right side of your schedule

68
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,920
All right, but there's three different time zones mentioned on it

69
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,520
so

70
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,640
So people are to go the first one

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,480
Am I missing where it says all times displayed at EST I literally cannot see it

72
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm looking everywhere that you can see my freaking pupils

73
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,160
Looking around I see there's three time zones in the right column

74
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,840
But then in the actual schedule is just picked a time

75
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
Where?

76
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,360
You know what the fun thing is you guys are never gonna know what the offline

77
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,760
Ed it looks like of my schedule. I was giggling away

78
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,920
Cuz em Emi was being a cutie pie and

79
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,560
Then I was like wait no one's ever actually seen the offline mode of what my schedule looks like

80
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,600
Ed no starting right binding of Isaac for two hours. I doubt it. Well, I

81
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm gonna need no because the problem is

82
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,880
Runescape part wait runescape part four doesn't tell everyone to download the movie

83
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,840
Right, so runescape part four and part five. I'm gonna try and finish cooking in those two

84
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
I don't know if it's possible

85
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,520
But in runescape part four we're watching the John Wick series

86
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,560
I know I said I didn't want to watch it, but I had to basically I

87
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Couldn't find any other trilogy that I wanted to watch

88
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,080
So then I said no we'll do that and then in runescape part five

89
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,920
We're actually gonna sit and just watch

90
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,440
The girls is live streams because I can't keep up with them

91
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,920
However, I can keep up with them if we can watch them whilst we do runescape wine

92
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,800
So on the last day, I'm literally gonna sit and watch all the streams that I wanted to watch from the girls

93
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,280
Okay, each girl I'm gonna pick a stream where I'm like, I'm I want to watch that. I'm I want to watch that

94
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
I'm I want to watch that and

95
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Cuz like I really want to watch as there is monetization stream. I don't have fucking time like when I finish this

96
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,680
Um

97
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,800
What is it called when I finish this um um?

98
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,840
Endurance stream, I'm literally gonna go and put subtitles in the mimosa collab so then it uploads

99
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Before I stream tomorrow

100
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,640
Oh

101
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,840
Yes, John Wick is one two and three wait. No is the fourth movie already

102
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Oh

103
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,920
Right, I'll edit that before I tweet it because I just want to watch John Wick one two three

104
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,080
I unless for I don't know how long they all are sometimes movies are like two and a half hours and I can't do that

105
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:51,520
He shoots his pufusal. Oh my god. It's already out. I can he keep up the fourth one

106
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,520
You said there's a fifth one in production

107
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,560
Bro, he that man a break let that man retire wasn't that the whole plot line that he's fecking retired?

108
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,880
Oh some of yous have got a cheat honestly

109
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Making same one after same one after same one nothing but a cheat around you. Oh wait. No, I can't go in the middle

110
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
I go here

111
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,160
Whoa, yeah, I always forget that I

112
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Always forget that

113
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Force one is

114
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,160
169 minutes long, so it's two and a half hours and they didn't wrap it up in two and a half

115
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
I

116
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:51,780
What's the plan of action I've no got a clue I think we're going back to the DLC I have a tonne of flasks that actually heal me now

117
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,880
The irony that you speak about break for what force is the last one all right

118
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I

119
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Spoilers

120
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,800
Right, okay, we will watch John. Wait, I thought someone said John with fibers in production

121
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,020
I'm like what fucking like hands is gone to like some some kid and be like take take on my legacy

122
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:21,000
Where I just annihilate everyone and I actually only shoot how many guns are physically possible in the chamber

123
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,760
I

124
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,560
Did you upgrade your weapon not quite?

125
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,400
But I do have to acknowledge that the refunds are carrying me through everything

126
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,200
It's just something like that. There's a bit. No, that's how the fifth minute. There's five offer fucks thing

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm gonna have to change my movie choice. What is a trilogy or some sort of movie?

128
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,800
scenario that all from the same thing

129
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
That'll give us like ten hours

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
roughly I

131
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,160
Need ten hours so we can just fucking wine out max wine out

132
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,360
No, I can someone said spider-man. I might just do spider-man so we can all laugh at the dancing scene

133
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:20,520
We should watch one piece. Are you John? I'd never be off stream for how long?

134
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,380
Yeah, Toby McGuire's big Spidey man. I might do that. I

135
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,800
Would say shrek one to three, but I didn't like the third installment. I think it's shite. I hate it

136
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
and

137
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,640
Fortune load

138
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:43,280
The reason why Lord of the Rings is out of the question or the Hobbit is because I'm doing it on Christmas and I'm doing it on

139
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,400
My brain won't hold on let me drink my tea. Hold on. Let me drink my tea cuz I'm clearly not awake right now

140
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Christmas what you plan that forehead? Yeah on Christmas day. We're watching Lord of the Rings and then on Boxing Day

141
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
We're watching the Hobbit

142
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:20,120
Maybe the final destination I have a really big fear of flying and I can't really watch

143
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Oh

144
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,640
Blade is through movies is play those vampire ones. I don't think I've seen that

145
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:42,520
Boxing day is the day after Christmas. So the 26th of December so 25th Christmas 26th is

146
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Called boxing day in the UK

147
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,320
It's where you put on gloves and you're supposed to box someone that you have

148
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,440
Like negative feelings for but it's supposed to be done in a comedic way and then after I'm fucking with you

149
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,720
That's absolutely not what boxing day is but boxing day is on the 26th of December

150
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,240
I think it's a retail shopping thing

151
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Blade yes

152
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. No boxing day is a thing

153
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,680
I think you're in what statistically what I recall is that it's supposed to be everything's on sale

154
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,840
So it's just another way for the

155
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,600
Capit the cogs in the machine to spend all their hard-earned money

156
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,160
So boxing day yeah, just like so you can start the new year fresh. You just have a little go at each other

157
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
That's terrible

158
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,360
What if shadow of the earth tree it was shadow of the freak tree and instead of playing the DLC we just

159
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Played with each other and go

160
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,960
Okay

161
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
Very interesting

162
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,520
Are you gonna reimburse me for the DLC then if we do that?

163
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,400
I have no idea what I'm doing

164
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Ah

165
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,600
Who's leading me who's what we're doing

166
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,760
When you get picked up by cops tell them strong I told you so

167
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
Everyday is boxing day. They should have seen this

168
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,520
Sweeper pulled off yesterday a TKO double on shorty. All right then all right then sirion sirion

169
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,400
Actually, it was a servants Christmas the people were who were on staff for Christmas parties and fees

170
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,360
But actually exchange them on boxing day. I think Poland do it. Is it Poland do it the day before as well?

171
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,120
That could just be making utter pish up. I really

172
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,840
Um oh my god, I don't have live chat on no

173
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,760
Didn't miss how many messages. I swear. Why is freaking talk chat even a thing on YouTube?

174
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,840
I want to see all the all the terrible remarks

175
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,920
Right, I'm gonna be honest my socks are full

176
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Oh

177
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,220
My souls are just being cheating don't you want right where we're going stage front? We're gonna see

178
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
You're ignoring us. No

179
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
I'm supposed to go around part. I

180
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,400
Didn't even know there's a difference so basically it goes like wait a minute

181
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Can I hear the enemy?

182
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Hear the enemy I think

183
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,240
I don't know why I can't remember why I turned it down

184
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Are we deciding on a challenge?

185
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
I can't do it right now

186
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Are you squiddling me right now?

187
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,120
Wow spent the last few days moving along with a 20 hour drive

188
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,360
So I have a lot of the box to catch up on but I'm glad to be settled and back to live you

189
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,280
My days were too quiet without you around. Oh, yeah, you couldn't have you couldn't handle when I was

190
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,080
In your ear all the time you can

191
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,480
You need that back. Have I conditioned you to need the yaps so badly. Thank you for the 50 Spidey. Holy crap. That was a lot

192
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
and

193
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
Mummy he was so loud was he

194
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,240
There I've turned him down. I'm sorry, but he Brian Brian bit end over Brian right now

195
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
I

196
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,520
TTS is loud game is loud. I think Johnny's just deaf

197
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Okay, I put the game down I

198
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,280
Put Brian down by six

199
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
decibels I

200
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,960
Oh wait, is this the lion behind this cathedral?

201
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,240
I also in my browsing

202
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,520
Apparently very popular church driver. What's his name? The one that wipes blood on the wall. I

203
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,160
Don't know if there's any refunds are able to do this fight. Let's find out

204
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,160
There's a few refunds that can do this fight. Let's see

205
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,800
How the fuck you were here right by the end of the stream. Are you guys not sleeping or insomniacs or something?

206
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,480
How the fuck is anyone here that's still standing from yesterday? Hello?

207
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,600
Right, this is a boss fight so it so someones don't count. I'm like not putting you to war

208
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,040
Are you guys getting any sleep at all? I'm getting worried like it doesn't matter if I don't get sleep

209
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
But you guys are getting sleep. Hello

210
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,960
What we're two melee experts. We've got blade the

211
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Oh

212
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Right

213
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:39,040
Right, so the way we do this I send you guys in for the kill. I sit and commentate. I slept for 11 hours

214
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:46,280
She's she said sleep. She says what is sleep? What is the oh no sleep? Oh, she can't meet our sleep schedule

215
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,840
It's not your sleep schedule. That's terrible

216
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,360
Sleep in this economy four hours is plenty of sleep. Oh god the ritual. How could I forget?

217
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,760
So if you guys were unavailable yesterday, please don't worry and you guys can stream site me

218
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm actually gonna pin our

219
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,360
Multi-player password because I forgot to do that

220
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
And I'm very excited to do this

221
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,000
So yesterday when we play

222
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:25,740
You know when you hear all those stories about the pre-war rituals necessary like they the women would cast

223
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,440
Wait, what I've looked at or generate as men golds audio is very loud

224
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
Which is causing some of the viewers to just

225
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,980
Complain despite the loudness the viewers are all right

226
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,580
Anyway, anyway, anyway, right multi-player password is

227
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,540
That's how you spell password. I am so sorry. I'm clearly not looking up right now

228
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,260
I

229
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Terrible see absolutely terrible

230
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,460
Right, so we have a pre-war ritual from around these parts

231
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,580
I never send off a refling in a battle with this boy cherry. I take it

232
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,340
And this is what we do every time oh

233
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,940
Oh, oh you give me a hero's run

234
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Okay, I'm not gonna open it right you ready

235
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,020
Go jump the Scottish women right I can't is this the is the lion. Oh god

236
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,620
Okay, we seem to have two melee

237
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,020
Beeflings everyone does have a magical spell refling down. I want to go for it. I want to help I

238
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,100
Take it back. I don't want to help. I don't want to help. I don't want to help

239
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
You guys dodging that

240
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,100
I need like a bow and arrow, I think I go grab the start getting a bow and arrow. Oh

241
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
I

242
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,060
No, there's no way I'll let us have a few attempts, but I'm sorry. There's no way. Oh

243
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,780
Yeah, take that 300 damage, baby. Oh

244
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,220
It's freaking ours just got me

245
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,360
Okay, I did 300 damage you're welcome me playing

246
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,940
Oh, yeah, oh my souls I forgot about my soul. How many is it was actually quite a lot. I

247
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,340
Didn't even know the game would remember that

248
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,140
How are you doing there?

249
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,420
I

250
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,300
Canel

251
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:43,420
I'm gonna need a crossbow bolt or something actually helping these fights. I can't even reach the enemy

252
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,460
before about stamina

253
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,780
Holy shit

254
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,500
Am I gonna fuck up being near this repellent? I think I may be I mean he's doing fine without me

255
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:00,260
I'm not being funny. I think I'm fucking it up if I interact at the face

256
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,660
Ah, wait, hold on. I want to help if he's getting

257
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:16,620
Stop it I commandeer to kneel. Oh, I cannot predict that that's like such

258
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
Oh

259
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,540
My gosh, I think I'm gonna have to get some sort of magic spell so I can

260
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:40,260
Commentate and help briefings instead of like I wanted to do a two-hand. I've never done a magic bill before

261
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
I

262
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Didn't know he had lightning

263
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Honestly, it's kind of frightened

264
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,940
Leave that refling alone shit

265
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,900
How am I running him? I don't know. I'm just outpacing him gently

266
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
I

267
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
Think the enemy honestly

268
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,740
Okay

269
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,940
Wait, that was just things

270
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,420
Hit from a distance oh my god

271
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:30,340
Bruh, okay, I thought I'm starting to understand why people may or may not have done the DLC

272
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
That was like hard

273
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,300
Who wants to try it the reef oracle

274
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,660
reforeacle

275
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
Foreacle me mommy

276
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,380
Now please don't worry, I'm not actually putting your name down for any

277
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:56,360
Main game stuff like when we go adventure in this your name does not get tallied against any like a walk around stuff with me

278
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
I'll finish this piece

279
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,040
Oh

280
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Lovely

281
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
No, did you not come in

282
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,120
Yeah, but you clearly have better connection right we have a bleed build from the looks of it skinny Molyneke late

283
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,040
Bleed build and then we have a and second

284
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,560
Maybe we have some sort of magical staff you guys want a little pre-war ritual moment

285
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Can't send you in a battle now without

286
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,600
getting your rewards

287
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,160
surely if you're gonna defend the house of

288
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,440
Strony you get what's going to you

289
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,940
Well, oh cuz I was in the jump animation it didn't like that

290
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,360
Guys don't look I'll die immediately. Thank you. Right. You're ready. Yes, steady

291
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,080
You be have to do some clips. I'll literally just like my IQ

292
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,240
Okay, he like loads up quite a bit

293
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,120
Sorry

294
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,880
I'm just trying to like get a feel of his attack pattern

295
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,320
He seems like slight delay, but he can definitely like do a back kick into stuff

296
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Which is quite curious

297
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,360
Yeah, but he can turn so quickly as well. This is I

298
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,640
Must say this is a fantastic boss. This really is the design his capabilities. I've only seen phase two, which is lightning

299
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Yeah, this as well. This is a nasty amount of work nasty nasty

300
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:52,880
But I love it. I have to admit. I love it. It's like a whirlwind type of whack again

301
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,920
Yeah, see the effects of that is fantastic

302
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,160
Don't worry lads. I helped for 200 damage. I really did. I really did. I cannot imagine

303
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,200
Anyone playing this solo. Oh my god. It's cheeky little spank on his butt

304
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,480
He it's because of his a bit he's free and he's free and

305
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,840
He's a male he's a Tom cat. He's a male Tom cat he's free and

306
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,640
Okay, I got 400 on them there. I'm so good at this game honestly

307
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,040
Wow, wow, wow, wow

308
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,280
Oh

309
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,760
Dear that was a fantastic attempt. So

310
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,440
Just trying to see it. So it seems to do a dive down and then a back sweep

311
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,440
Just trying to tame off accordingly

312
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,520
Yeah, he yeah, he can react instantly as soon as the tackle changes. He will swipe you and oh, sorry. Sorry didn't mean to do that

313
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
Okay, oh

314
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
That was for me

315
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,480
Rats, sorry, I thought he locked back on to the other replant. I do apologize

316
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,200
Some may find solo easier for the boss fight

317
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,040
Well, no one said that some may find solo easier actually because of more flash

318
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,360
Does everyone have I'm sure I think everyone's got the fast we'll give it a few good tries

319
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,360
If not, I'm actually fine to explore elsewhere. Like I went past all those scorpion places

320
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,920
And I wouldn't mind backtrack into all the scorpion places and because I feel like this

321
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:51,120
And this DLC Russian on my dick. Thank you. And this DLC is got so many areas to go like so many a doubt

322
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,640
We're actually stuck here so quickly and to explore in the DLC

323
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,240
And so we can do some adventuring and I'll just take you for walkies

324
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Unironically solo can be a bit easier because the boss is more predictable predict all over

325
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,240
Predict all over your butt, but predicts of all

326
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Okay, ready

327
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
Daddy

328
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:19,000
You guys have the lie down a mo always blessing us. Oh, we're getting play. Good man. Do you guys want you at my blessing?

329
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,000
There we go bless bless to impress

330
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,220
There we go bless bless to impress

331
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Okay, let's get it

332
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,840
Get it. Let's get it. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Got bit. Got a bit. Hey, got a bit excited there

333
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,120
Okay, okay, I'm picking up my soul. Oh, wow. He never does that first

334
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,080
Holy shit. Give me that. Oh, I missed my souls. Wait, I can't see anything

335
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,360
Oh

336
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:03,520
Reflings get a little bit rolled off the bat, but that's understandable happening say wait, you know aggro change. See it's so hard. Oh

337
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,080
I rolled I should have rolled into right

338
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Do a whack do a roll

339
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,040
Wow that aggro is so unforgiving. I

340
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,920
Can't even be mad though. It's so good

341
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,080
Wait, what's that glass? I don't even know what my wondrous physics the deep flask is

342
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,240
I'm just shoving it on though. We all just have a good time out here

343
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,560
Okay, that was actually really lucky with it. I would even get that spanking

344
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,320
I'm wondering. Oh, that was a big tally whack. Honestly, that was a lot of damage there

345
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,680
It came to cornering him, but he doesn't like it

346
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,280
Did I get electrocuted if I spank a car a

347
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,960
We bet wait you can't hit on money electrocuted or am I going crazy making that up?

348
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,120
What are you doing tonight? No, I can't help

349
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,080
No sugar that was the rolling some twice

350
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Oh

351
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
No, we were actually doing so good

352
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
I'm so sorry

353
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,200
We were actually doing so good. It's that it's that second bait. He does against me

354
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,280
I need to roll into him, but my instincts are like roll away roll away enemy enemy. Oh

355
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
He got me in two hits

356
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,720
Oh my god, I've killed all the refunds with two left there. Okay, and come Clarissa

357
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
a

358
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,160
Russian

359
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
And

360
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Oh, no, no, no, that's a fucking MPC. I'm sorry. That's an MPC. Oh

361
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Why am I born like this?

362
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,320
Why am I born like this it's a fucking MPC

363
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,520
The MPC is a reflin to know she started hitting

364
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,320
The invader reflin. Oh, she looks straight up follows you around. Wait, how far does she do you follow me down here? Oh

365
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,960
She like she like proper hangs out

366
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,800
Wait, can I just we'll do the fight I promise we'll do the fight

367
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,320
But does she like proper come and whack like the scorpions and stuff?

368
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
Coming

369
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Go kill scorpions I

370
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,040
Didn't know that in-game MPCs would do that. How do we join scrawny BPC be

371
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,480
Elden Ring be Elden Ring DLC and then you can come join me

372
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,960
Yeah, she go go kill that MPC go kill that

373
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
We'll kill it

374
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,400
We'll kill it MPC. Oh, she does fight it. Whoa. I

375
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
Don't know how I dodged all of that

376
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,520
Sorry, I'm probably making this week for the boss attempt. I'm just so curious

377
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,920
So she does that's curious. I didn't know in-game MPCs would walk around. Yeah, that is

378
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,840
Fascinating sorry

379
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,000
The password is reflux. Yes

380
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,360
So in multiplayer if you do your password and then you'll use what's called a tarnished furled finger at the

381
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,240
Same location I'm at and then you'll be able. I'll be able to summon you in and

382
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,560
I can only summon two good reflins at a time in one bad one, but I can't summon bad ones right now. Are you ready?

383
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
No pressure since only ones are refling and the others an MPC

384
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
No pressure at all

385
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
I

386
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Fucking

387
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Oh, she's doing magic

388
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Whoa

389
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
I can't even fucking see none

390
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Oh

391
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,880
You've done something to me, I don't know what I'm magic. Why is this a thing? The thing just changes

392
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,280
It just changes. I wasn't doing it right. I didn't count. I didn't count no one no one should be embarrassed

393
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,680
I didn't count I didn't count because there was one end of you. Well, this is starting well

394
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,920
Well, we're gonna give it a few times if it doesn't work

395
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
We're gonna go exploring cuz I like exploring

396
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,800
Cuz we've got so much of the map to go as well like tons of the map

397
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Okay, here we go

398
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Will you not had a shot

399
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,480
Is that wolf the fridge or my just hungry

400
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
So

401
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Oh

402
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,880
Jack you've not been in these are my chosen warriors

403
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:27,320
Surely we will be successful. Nah, I'll give us quite a few shots and then the AI tank in the boss so hard

404
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
I swimper in

405
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,120
There's so if you didn't know there's no like voice chat in the game or anything like that

406
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,120
But there are coconuts in the game

407
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,960
Which is hilarious because there's one coconut that's crying, but it sounds like whimpering

408
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
So the reflins come in and they go

409
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
Okay, the ritual has been

410
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,680
The reflings are safe yet again

411
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,800
Hello. Yes, you look he held a coconut and the coconut goes

412
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,440
That kind of locking onto the boss might be detrimental to the crazy movement

413
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,320
That's what I think like whenever I go against the wee dragon or whatever it keeps locking onto its chest

414
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,960
Can you stop going for me one this is feeling very targeted

415
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
We didn't even get an attempt

416
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,920
It's because I'm going for the souls I think I'm gonna have to hold back. I can't believe it. Oh

417
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,280
That was

418
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,080
Okay, I'm starting to understand why people are like, bro, what the heck no one can even play this unless you and

419
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,920
Before anyone's like get good scrub up fucking relax. Okay one relax to

420
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:20,000
Oh wait, I can actually help in the fight now. How do I use it? I need balls

421
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,640
Well, what I do I just aim

422
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
I

423
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,240
Said I just aim can I actually help in the fight right hold on I need to bless you to first door I

424
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,560
Can actually help in a fight question mark. I need to go by arrows

425
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,160
I don't know right need to lie down

426
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,680
That can bless you get good scrub. How much of yesterday's 12 hours stream was spent dying not a lot

427
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,760
We actually we went we went and done a lot of stuff. You want pre-ritual? Oh wait, you give me something

428
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
And give me one ball

429
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Pre-ritual

430
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,800
You can't like you know go lie down you got crouched. Oh

431
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,000
Wow, this refunds it. Let's go. He's ready. He's pumped right. Let me get the crossbow ball on for you

432
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,480
This reflin is not messing around. He said nah move aside. You absolute noobs. You threaten

433
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,880
Have I assumed it's like auto-equipses

434
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,040
I

435
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,600
Assume the crossbow balls are all equipped it. Let's go

436
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,820
Yeah, surely they're most locked and refling

437
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Okay

438
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Okay as if

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,080
As if you're coming for me hold on

Right so what aim and then shoot

441
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,440
Oh my god, it's rapid fire

442
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,920
Am I hitting I think I'm hitting. Oh my god

443
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,540
Speaking of hitting I'm getting hit. Oh

444
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,640
I'm getting hit

448
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,920
Nope, that's melee

449
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay, wait

450
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,320
Hold on you guys hold them off. I'm just gonna figure out how to equip arrows. How the fuck this?

We've got lightning with no got ace

458
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,980
Pop a magical dragon on this way hold on

459
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Hold on again

00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,960
Oh, I miss hold on I missed a suck

465
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080

Hold on I suck at this game hold on hold on. Oh, no

467
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,240
Wait

468
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,480
Somehow the like phase two attack doesn't hurt me as much as the other one

469
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
I'm helping I'm helping

470
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,200
Very one damage you have to be joking. That's funny is anything

471
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,200
I'm helping taking the aggro look at me. I'll take the aggro. I'm totally doing right now. I don't fucking

472
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,320
I'll just melee them. No my furry fling

473
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,640
Do I have enough to I'm just gonna have to

474
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Fucking melee with my body

475
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,000
My bloody I'm million. Oh, I want to at least get a hit in with my wee thing

476
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,840
Hit him hit him with it. Yeah, I think I did it. Yeah, fuck you

477
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Bitch

478
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,400
It feels different things to damage you need some more blue bars to rapid fire. Oh, I never did any of that

479
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,760
The repeating fires a weapon are

480
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,880
Okay

481
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,920
That was very unique. Have hardly any crossbow balls. Do you need to buy them all? Do you want?

482
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
I

483
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,120
Didn't really understand that but I had fun on the list, which is the main thing though

484
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,040
Okay, let's see

485
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,560
You had a short you've not had a short yet

486
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
I don't think I've seen you today no

487
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
No

488
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,400
Okay, can't wait for you to get to get to bail

489
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,240
Looks cool, what's the password to join it be it's pinned

490
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,600
If you didn't multiply your password and you're at the same location as me

491
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,280
Which is the stage front on the DLC

492
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,640
You may be able to carry me or I might just mess everything up in the game

493
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,640
Wow, we've got here. Who have we got here? Let's take two melee boys

494
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,200
Any melee player? Oh wait, wrong one

495
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,280
Pretty long cheeky pre-war ritual

496
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
We are good to go

497
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,080
Get my crossbow ball on so I can be of some use to my darling

498
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,880
refling

499
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,960
Not sure I'll try and pick up my souls because I quite a lot

500
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,760
Finally home from a week of camping without signals

501
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,080
So got a week of screams to catch up on still 25 minutes behind

502
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:44,480
But how to train your dragon is a good trilogy candidate for a watch a lot. Oh it is but it makes me cry

503
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,480
I remember like ball in my eyes at my grand's house watching that

504
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,480
I

505
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,640
Really not understand in the inventory system. I have tons of arrows selected

506
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,720
Whatever bear with me bear with me

507
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,200
Thank you so much for the tip a milk cadmium

508
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,600
I'll be able to fight hit that and actually respond in just a moment. You see I'm doing what's called

509
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,480
You look away for a second

510
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,120
Hold on don't zap me. I'm swapping. Um, I don't get it. I really get all collected

511
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,640
Why are you doing that now I just put what I

512
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Just put that on

513
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,800
It's a great ball. It has to be a ball ball. I'm so confused

514
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:54,160
Why doesn't it not all put like our own chamber? I mean, I guess I know our

515
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
kind of special I

516
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,360
Know arrows are like kind of special but

517
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,920
I'm healthy. I'm doing what's called tick damage

518
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,480
Oh, he's getting all it on I think I'm out after this

519
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,800
I think that's all my balls

520
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,300
Other than that, but why can't I use it then ultimate ball?

521
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
No, it's not

522
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:36,880
I'm so sorry, holy crap imagine watching your ally on the field like shaking her wife and around

523
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,560
She doesn't know what an error is going on. It's because it's not a regular ball

524
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,880
It's like putting a nine-volt battery in and a triple a battery slow. Okay, that makes more sense

525
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,440
Do I have an arrow

526
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,560
You reeflings you're doing great sweeties. Keep it up. Mommy's mommy's just gonna

527
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,360
I actually didn't pick up a bow and arrow at one point

528
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,680
Keep it up darlings. You're doing great. Mommy's so proud of you

529
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,120
Keep that focus maintain that focus

530
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,760
I've got a weapon of mana. Oh

531
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,080
You're doing fantastic. Keep it up, honey. Oh

532
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,920
Wow

533
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,200
Wow

534
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,820
Where's the foot that not even have a magic staff that I can like do something from afar with oh

535
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,180
You're doing great, honey

536
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,020
Unable to use it

537
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,140
Where's my weapon I can't even use it. Why would you let me equip it if I can't even use it? Oh

538
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,140
You're doing amazing sweeties. Oh

539
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,140
You're doing fantastic. No, no, no. Oh

540
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,580
No, this can't be

541
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,640
Okay, I'll see jump into it. Oh, no, it's not a jump into it kind of attack. Fuck you

542
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:13,500
Oh, I can't see anything. I'm just happy to be here. Yeah, it's not happening not with me anyway

543
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,580
Not with me. I am I the one it's not possible

544
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,740
It's not possible

545
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:28,660
Take this yes, that's right. Take that 300 damage, you know, you like it baby, you know, you like that damage

546
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,580
Oh press B, but far too late

547
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,140
Wow, no shot that any other

548
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,580
Oh

549
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,620
So Danny

550
00:47:54,780 --> 00:48:00,900
Your character literally isn't smart enough to use magic. I I think that's a pretty on par with me

551
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,540
I

552
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,860
Don't know how to get an arrow, but I do have it. No, I do have arrows

553
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,740
I've 20 arrows

554
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:18,020
So I can totally help it like oh my god, I can help so much for real for real

555
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:25,420
There is no, that's the NPC stop stop. I'm getting tempted by the NPC stop it

556
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,900
You're so stinky

557
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,580
You can respect if you have a level here people can just drop balls for you somebody draw for a couple stacks of balls

558
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,820
Just so I can continually go like

559
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,260
Oh, you've not had a shot

560
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:48,140
Do you want to hear my five head gaming tactic I did today? Oh

561
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:53,580
Rilke Kadman again. Thank you for the tip finally one from a weaker captain without a signal

562
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:58,580
So I got a weaker streams to catch bro. You need to like times three those streams. Oh

563
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,980
Wow

564
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,980
Holy crap. These are a lot

565
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,740
Okay, okay. Okay. We might be in the money. We might be in the money

566
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:14,500
Possibly in the money. Okay. I definitely can help out. Holy crap. How do you guys have so much stock?

567
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,540
You guys should be like a shop in this game, right? You ready for the pre-war ritual. Oh

568
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:26,100
We're getting blessed as well. I might need to hurry with the ritual for got a blessing on. Oh, hold on

569
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,500
Oh, right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go get us in there get us in there because we've got a blessing

570
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,620
That's activated and I don't know what they mean. I'd assume the time out

571
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,860
That shouldn't be time out. No, don't look at me

572
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,900
Why don't look at me

573
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,860
Don't look at me. I'm not even got my ball out. Oh, oh, hold on

574
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,580
Pause the fight. Pause the fight. Hold the music. Pause the tunes

575
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:57,540
Hold on hold on hold on hold on. Oh sure. Let's just spam out like these balls

576
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,060
Okay, one at a time. One at a time. Let's go

577
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,700
This is called tick damage. Right, let me pick up my soles actually while I'm at it

578
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:17,820
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. A lot of incantations have comedically short duration. That's what I'm like

579
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,900
Okay, we need to go like now. I

580
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,940
Think I'm just shy of like a hundred pairs of balls unless it's you guys doing damage and me just not

581
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,180
Comprehending. I'm doing like nothing to help

582
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:36,700
She would need a real carry aspect to do like this and smudge it

583
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,800
Oh

584
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,040
Whoa, okay, he did not appreciate the

585
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:51,380
He did not appreciate it. What do you mean? I'm just I just have a crossbow. I'm not doing anything special

586
00:50:52,380 --> 00:51:03,100
We're doing it. Should I do rapid fire? Nope, I'm getting rapid fire. Not the other way around, but it's

587
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,780
No, I didn't like that. I don't know why

588
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,220
I'm helping I'm helping

589
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:20,980
Mummy being scared in the corner while she sends in the reef wings to the colony. Oh sugar. We're down one

590
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,380
I have that

591
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,620
No, I

592
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:32,740
Have a girl I have a girl I repeat I have a girl give me over here. Oh, no

593
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:39,940
We're actually doing pretty decent. I think we can do it. Holy crap. Reflex. I honestly think you can do it

594
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,180
I have faith

595
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:46,380
I'm happy to camp. Sorry. I'm happy to do this. I actually genuinely have faith for hardly have faith

596
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,220
And

597
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:55,880
I'm actually doing decent amount of damage over time because accumulatively decent damage

598
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa?

599
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:15,020
Why why is the arrow keep coming to me I'm just a swimmer

600
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:22,000
Where's streamer luck I don't know why I'm not risking it though

601
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,700
Holy crap. We might do it

602
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,700
You guys are actually so pee

603
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:36,940
It's all my crossbow, I'm sorry. It's all my crossbow. I had to reload there. I had to reload there

604
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:43,220
It's literally all my crossbow. Sorry. What was that 62 damage? I

605
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,820
Absolutely, absolutely

606
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:52,340
Absolutely, please leave me alone. I can't see anything. Please leave me alone. Please leave me alone. I need to heal

607
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:00,660
Okay, okay, no, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine

608
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,900
Just a few more. Ow my freaking kitty

609
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,980
Just a few more

610
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:16,700
Do not die. I swear to God we fling if you leave me alone to say I'm gonna be so sad. I

611
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:24,660
Do not give you permission to die. Do you understand? Do you understand? Well, you did not understand. That's terrible

612
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:30,580
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please crossbow, please

613
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,980
Are you serious?

614
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:40,740
I had to hit one more crossbow. I can't even see the

615
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,580
fucking HB

616
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,180
When will you learn?

617
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,420
When will you learn? Are you joking? It was one HB. Oh

618
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,780
My gosh

619
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,820
Come on game you suck

620
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,260
You knew exactly I should have won

621
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:10,500
Bruh, that's twice now. It's been on me and I've completely bowled the art

622
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,340
You just hey man

623
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:19,580
You both just wait, how did you guys respond faster than me?

624
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,740
Am I miss under it? Wait, am I being dumb?

625
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,700
You can equip two different bolts that wants to swap

626
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,260
How would I swap

627
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,780
So when you come

628
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:47,140
Wow, we did fantastic there. Someone please give her bleed bolt. Oh, I think someone may have already possibly

629
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:59,500
I don't think any briefly I don't think anyone plays with a crossbow. So no one actually has like crossbowls to go

630
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:05,640
There's also something called Lord Heals that you can get from turtle cope that can heal the reefing. Oh

631
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,780
Oh my god, I can't fight the gender norms. I want to be a healer so bad

632
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,540
Are we going you want to oh

633
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,060
Do you want to go for it and you want to go you just want to go straight into it?

634
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:26,580
Okay, no ritual. So a kiss and a kiss. Good luck. Let's go. Let's get to it. Let's get to it

635
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,580
Everybody to it to it

636
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:38,740
Not me, you're not actually supposed to go for me hold on I need my

637
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,260
Through my brother

638
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,040
Look at that 36 damage, you love to see it ladies and gentlemen

639
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:07,420
36 that okay, I will say as humorous is that is to land like 40 damage

640
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:11,860
I am actually it adds up. Okay. It's like a numbers game

641
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,060
Number goes higher the more time I hit this crossbow. I

642
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,620
Can not believe that. Oh

643
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:21,940
My god, I

644
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,340
Mean he is reacting

645
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,820
And I I think I do take our group wait a few times to chill

646
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:34,500
Like even that small agro there, yeah, and then I'll go agro again

647
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,020
One two

648
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,100
Wow

649
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,140
Oh, it does three rotations geez

650
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,340
Wow

651
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Oh

652
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,800
I'm keen to get in the attack pattern just a little bit like when he does a big sweep

653
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,340
He does a delete second one, which is what always gets me

654
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,260
Oh, he said I see your lava. I'm taking off the board

655
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,260
I

656
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:25,180
Got agro again one swipe pause, maybe no

657
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:34,780
Didn't quite understand that I guess he's in a different face, so he'll react differently and do different

658
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,020
So it's a bit okay back to me

659
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:46,460
Which is fine happy with that. Oh, he's asleep. Sorry. I think I just fucked up your special attack on him there

660
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,260
It was an honest mistake

661
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,860
I'm doing it. I'm he's not giving me agro

662
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:02,620
Yeah, the reflins are just bouncing between the agro between them both

663
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,620
I mean, maybe it's kind of good that it's done like that

664
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,940
I'll maybe try and lure him away

665
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,900
Right keeps moving so much. I'm missing all my shots

666
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,900
Oh

667
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:22,220
Some heavy damage one reflin is down. No, we've so got this. Sorry, but we're actually getting so close

668
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,780
We are a hundred percent getting so close

669
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:31,660
I'm gonna see if I can take that agro a bit. Let him jump into me. I'm afraid I'm not familiar with this wind phase that much

670
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,140
I don't really know what he does

671
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,540
He does that

672
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:41,260
Learning learning not good. Not good. Okay. He blocks his lightning phase

673
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:49,420
So he has he has different elemental phases. No, he doesn't because he just used winter and ice and oh, shit

674
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,940
Oh, well

675
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:59,420
There is we did fantastic. I'm not even mad. I'm not even mad. I don't have enough time to swap to my other weapon

676
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,180
I don't have time

677
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:10,300
Okay, that's not bad a hundred percent. We have this fate. I'm not leaving. We have this fate. I'm satisfied that we

678
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:18,540
Definitely have oh wait, dad. Can I not do spirit ashes? Oh, no, I can't do spirit ashes because I have it as a crossbow upgraded

679
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,700
I think it's probably level one

680
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,780
um

681
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,620
We a hundred percent can do this. I have faith. I'm sorry. I have faith. I believe

682
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,500
I believe in a thing called love

683
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,340
Yeah

684
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,140
A hundred percent have oh

685
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,540
Why did they do that?

686
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,100
They know full well what they're doing when they do that

687
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,060
You can put your sword in another hand

688
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,140
Like that

689
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,660
And how do I get it out?

690
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:05,420
Oh, sorry. Sorry. I'm just practicing. Oh, we've got blood bone bolts. Let's check them out

691
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
Uh

692
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,260
Causes

693
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:13,980
Blood blood loss build up so it has less damage, but it goes for

694
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,500
Like critical build up. That's curious

695
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,540
Perfumers bolts

696
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:25,500
Uh flame balls black key balls. Okay. The reef one. So you want it right?

697
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,940
That's your ritual

698
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,420
Uh a hundred percent think we'll go there

699
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,900
A whole 45 that seven damage

700
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,700
All right, let me quickly get my thingies my thingy my bobbers

701
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:48,940
I yeah, I'm making a hundred percent of this fight. I have faith

702
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:57,260
I don't know when you learn the enemy too too silly damage

703
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:04,060
That was one that was two. Yeah, I did it too early. I know I'm getting it now though. I did it too early

704
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,220
I get it

705
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:13,180
I don't know if I'm going to get like a notification that he just gets to bleed out damage. I don't think so

706
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,740
I've taken the aggro. They can get a few hits in

707
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,940
I know I'm not taking the aggro

708
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,820
Holy holy

709
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:32,620
I'm helping I'm helping okay, we're in lightning phase. That's good

710
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:36,860
When we get into the wind phase, that's when we know we're the

711
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:45,100
I think it's lightning then wind and then ice elemental phases and then that's when we know we're in the money or not

712
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:58,060
We're getting there we're getting there 50 percent 50 percent delayed jump. No

713
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,140
Oh

714
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:04,940
We got a critical we did get a critical

715
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:17,340
But only okay, we've got we've got ice we've got ice. I repeat there is ice on the board

716
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,220
One refling does go down

717
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:23,180
However, he's he's getting so low

718
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,420
Oh

719
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,380
How do I change my weapon?

720
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:38,060
This'll do this'll do donkey. Okay. Whoa. I figured it out. I don't think I'm gonna win but I figured it out

721
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:46,460
Bro, you need to calm down like seriously need to calm down. Oh crap. It's strong

722
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:52,380
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. We still have that. I'm I'm so happy

723
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,060
Oh

724
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:02,140
We can do it we can do it we can do it if you really want

725
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:11,260
Here we go, uh russian you've got two tally

726
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,620
Bolt delivery

727
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,860
No, that's hilarious

728
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,020
Uh, hello, it's your delivery. Oh what you got for me?

729
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,580
That bolts that's hilarious

730

Stop being so funny refling stop it your humor is unmatched bolt delivery

731
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,700
If he bleeds a big chunk of his health just disappears

732
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,460
I can't tell if it's the reeflings getting a good big tallywack in or not

733
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,940
Well, that armor looks really unique. It's got like ram horns that come all the way from the front to the back

734
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:56,140
Oh

735
01:03:56,140 --> 01:04:00,940
Explosive balls if I've messed around with explosive bolts before

736
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,140
I had a great ball great balls

737
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:17,500
Jeez you are not kidding when you said delivery holy crap. Oh my god, we're still going we're still going

738
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,820
My bolt door dasher is here honestly

739
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:28,940
A ballista five level five ballista is a ballista what's gonna hold

740
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:36,460
Oh a ballista is what holds these masses

741
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,180
Our mama's understand

742
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,140
Oh

743
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,340
Okay, oh, oh, did you leave?

744
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:55,580
Will did you have a shot you did at some point? Oh my god, yeah

745
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:02,540
No, you're kind of in the middle you were recently not

746
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,900
Car in the betrayer

747
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,900
All right

748
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:21,820
I 100% think we've got this though the ballista will hold the big boy bolts. I mean fucking look at this thing getting

749
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,100
Yeah, like pop that away so I can two hands this

750
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,660
Holy crap, right? Are we are we getting to it? We get a little kisses a little pre-war kiss

751
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,780
Okay, are you ready? Because I don't have any oh wait you draw

752
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,060
Hold on we need to make sure everyone's the ping is working well

753
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,900
All right, we seem to have two melee experts. Let's go melee

754
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:49,580
I wonder if melee magic crossbow might be the answer

755
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,820
Yeah, how do I

756
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,340
use this

757
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,580
Okay, let's not do this kind of stuff right now. Hold on. Let me get my

758
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,460
Hold on a minute very

759
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
Right you

760
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:15,340
Uh, am I using these right I am

761
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,900
I think I might hold on to them since a briefly is down already

762
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:28,220
Please understand when you guys play with me there will be obscene lag obscene in the mean

763
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,180
You know what I'm just gonna sort out

764
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,940
The sword take my sword. Yeah, no this sword women

765
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,300
Take the sword

766
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:43,900
And then and then take the sword only

767
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:50,140
Oh my god, two hands the sword women. No two hands the sword. Oh for fuck's sake

768
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,540
We tried the freaking

769
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,900
Oh

770
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:02,300
Wait, why am I not getting any hit registration does he have invincible invisible frames when he perishes someone?

771
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,180
Yeah, sorry. I'm not making this out alive

772
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:07,900
Hold y lb. That was miserable

773
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,340
Damn this line got hands literally

774
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,860
That rifling got eaten in a bite

775
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:20,060
Since when does he do hand grabs it must be his ultimate if you're low enough

776
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:26,220
All right, I'll maybe we'll do crossbow

777
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:33,820
I want to do that. Right. So that's fire to put them on fire and then that ludge

778
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,620
How's his blood loss build up we'll do that

779
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:45,980
And then poison build up. Yeah, that does take damage. That's how the game works, right surely

780
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,420
I mean I didn't I didn't twice taterally

781
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,660
You're actually being in

782
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:58,060
I'm just gonna check there's no one

783
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:07,740
A mage rifling, okay, let's see if mage melee and crossbow might work. I'm not sure

784
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:13,020
Just by the way, if it's not obvious, this is literally just two guys in a costume. Look

785
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,940
If they want to do it in their free time, that's fine as long as they just don't

786
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,620
I'm trying to make one of those jokes. We're just like

787
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:25,660
Terrible joke no one's laughing

788
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,740
Right, let's see

789
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:32,300
Are we ready a little a little pre-work is

790
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,580
And a little

791
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,580
Okay pre-work is let's go

792
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,580
I know we can do this

793
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:43,180
Sorry, but I'm not budging from this spot until we do it because I know we can do it

794
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,860
Okay, I'm gonna let him go for me

795
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,180
Not like this not my half a million souls not like this

796
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,940
Okay, now we can help

797
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,540
I've got poison on over bleed sugar I put them the wrong way

798
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,260
Wait, why would you take that first?

799
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:13,340
It's strange. Okay, there we go. Oh, I miss. I'm too far away

800
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:20,380
Uh, I'm helping question mark

801
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,420
He doesn't even know who to aggro well me clearly

802
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,460
Me clearly

803
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:40,700
He can move like so far

804
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,860
Blood and poison works in his case

805
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:51,900
I I can't react to anything. I'm so sorry. I'm like half asleep right now

806
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:57,260
I'm absolutely nothing going for me. I'm spanking himself with these crossbow bolts

807
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,060
Oh, no

808
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,700
Nah, this can't be

809
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,900
Oh, no, we're both we're both long range. I don't want him to take the aggro

810
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:19,580
Yeah, what are you doing? Oh the lightning. I can even react to the lightning if I wanted to

811
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:29,420
Ah sugar, uh, why left bumper? Yeah, I did it. Why left bumper?

812
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:37,740
Wow, okay, only to get absolutely decimated with poor reaction time. It's fine. It's fine. I'm not gonna win against fucking half

813
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:42,460
Wait, how did I dodge that? I didn't even roll or anything

814
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,700
We replays are also two people in a costume to make up the height

815
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,020
bleeding does 15% of the max hp. He's not used to

816
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,980
mage replays. That's why he's so confused

817
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:59,980
My story I'm late. How's the game so far? So we're back at this boss in the dlc

818
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:07,180
I know for a fact reeflings can do it because I you missed it. I got one hp in a dreamed

819
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,740
and

820
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,420
You've been in I'm just checking. Oh, you've not had a shot yet today

821
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,460
um

822
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,460
I'm just

823
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,140
We we can do it. So I refuse to walk away basically

824
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,820
I genuinely refuse to walk away because I know we can do it

825
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,660
You're ready to start so yeah

826
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,740
Weapon art is max hp tick damage

827
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:40,060
Leave some face to use the black knight

828
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:46,860
Put me in coach I just woke up and I got caffeine in me a yellow caffeinated

829
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:51,100
I might have to make another cup of tea like so fucking early into the stream. I'm sorry

830
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,580
I'll actually only played like what for 20 minutes and I'm like I need another cup of tea and dine

831
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,540
Okay, uh the pre how do I?

832
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,980
Oh, okay, we're doing the pre-war

833
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,780
As always I don't mind

834
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:11,100
Okay, we have been doing kisses just to speed things along a bit because I may or may not have been dying all the damn time

835
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,660
Right you're lying down

836
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:20,940
Okay, wait, let me do a run and start for this one. This is the run. This is the run. I bless. Oh, wait. Hold wait. What?

837
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:25,660
Oh freaking sake. Sorry. Sorry. Hold on. Hold on. I've got a bit over the else

838
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:29,500
This is the run. This is the blessing. Mine push gives you

839
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:36,780
Man shall feel no tighter clam in you humanity

840
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,460
right

841
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,460
I'll do it take damage

842
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,500
Is there even a point in putting my wee sword on? I don't know

843
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,820
I feel like I feel like I just messed things up if I put a second thing

844
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:54,220
I'm sleep deprived but I can still fight honestly when you said that

845
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,660
Not to brag or anything but I did 15 damage there smile

846
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:08,060
Why does it not lock to the bottom?

847
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,140
Well, someone poisoned them. I saw that that wasn't me that poisoned them

848
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,780
Oh, whoa

849
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,980
That rifling getting chomps, I didn't know you were in a war

850
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:35,980
I

851
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,300
Get cheeky bleeds

852
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:48,780
Whoa, I think that was the bleed there. Did you see that? I think that was me. I'm helping. I'm helping. I'm actually helping

853
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,300
I'm sorry. I was I was a pain attention. Sorry. Hold on

854
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:57,820
I think I actually did the bleed

855
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,420
Only took me how long

856
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:10,300
Oh, he's got his aggroed on me. Don't get distracted. Oh, nice walk. That's the problem. He keeps swapping angry

857
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:20,460
Come on right we're in phase two officially

858
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,020
Oh, we've got a lightning spray

859
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:31,180
Okay, aggroed that's fine unaggroed that's fine

860
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:36,060
That's not only complain. It's so freaking hard to tell

861
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,020
Like it feels so quick

862
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,340
of him coming into you

863
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:46,780
Oh, okay now. I can't dodge all these attacks. How are you supposed to?

864
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,380
Oh, thank god

865
01:14:55,020 --> 01:15:01,180
How are you supposed to do this solo? That was like what six barrage of an attack in one go

866
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:08,620
Oh, I was too late. I can see it coming but I think because of his phase one

867
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:13,660
I think in his phase two he's actually faster when he does that attack and it messes me up

868
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,300
Oh

869
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,260
What's that move? What is it?

870
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,980
It's like an ace song

871
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:36,140
Oh, is this it? I don't want to jinx it, but we're all pretty high health

872
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,940
I'm doing cheeky tick damage with my weak crossbow

873
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:50,380
Unless I twat it up manually twat it up anyone any manually twatters

874
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:55,820
Oh my god, we're doing it

875
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,980
Oh my god

876
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:04,380
Oh my god, I need I need to aggro off him right go right now. No, that's what didn't want. I needed to take aggro

877
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:14,220
I'm trying to like not cross over. Okay. I have aggro. That's good

878
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,220
No, I don't I've lost it. I've lost it

879
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:26,060
Oh shit, this sounds like a world of warcraft grade dps. Can you slow down you take an aggro off of me?

880
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,740
Okay, okay

881
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,220
Oh that ace stomp is so big

882
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:41,900
That ace stomp is so big. Okay. Okay. That's fine. I can handle it. I can handle it. I can handle it

883
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,220
Ah

884
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,100
You so hard that oh, maybe not

885
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:03,740
I know we can do it. I know we can do it. I'm sorry. I'm not leaving. I know you replants can do it

886
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:07,580
I'm so proud of you like you guys are putting in so much effort

887
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:11,020
You guys so have this like you really do

888
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,020
I

889
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:19,020
Apparently I already have a tally. Do you mean harm you don't have a tally?

890
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:25,020
I know you replants can do it. I really do. I believe in you wholeheartedly. You're doing fantastic

891
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:30,860
I know it's frustrating getting in the game and I know there's like and I know you've been debuffed and everything

892
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:32,860
But use use of got it. I'm so

893
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:36,860
I'm I know use of got it either so strong

894
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:43,340
I might need to do it this way if you want the blessing blessing. Oh again. All right. Oh shit. We're going for it

895
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,380
We're going for it. I think are we going for it? Okay. I think we're going for it

896
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,380
Right, you guys are doing fantastic in battle. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go

897
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,340
Oh, and my souls are right there. Thank you for kind

898
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,940
Oh whole 60 damage don't mind if I do

899
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,660
You

900
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,940
Okay, we're just gonna go for bleeds

901
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:17,660
I wasn't paying attention not gonna lie. Ma. Oh, yeah, okay

902
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,380
It's okay

903
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,060
Let him get up

904
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:26,780
And maybe when he goes up, I maybe actually oh, I think I just applied fleek damage

905
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:32,140
Or maybe one of the reasons that actually those melee weapons do look a bit bleed effect ish

906
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,100
So

907
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:43,420
Really the challenges we just need 10 bleed effect hits. That's it right because if it does

908
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,220
10% of the full health of the enemy

909
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,540
Oh shit, I'm not in position

910
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,740
Okay, okay, go a little cheeky special

911
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,540
So stagger

912
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,780
Strongly be a good girl and cover your ears

913
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:09,020
I want to thank all of my fellow reeflings for being such good fellow reeflings. I'm still love

914
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:12,620
Why would I need to cover my ears for that? They're so awesome

915
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,620
Um

916
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:22,300
Are you being nice to each other? That's awesome girl. Thanks for the fight. That's what I'm saying like you guys are gonna go where?

917
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:30,300
That's a dangerous move for the distance that storm ice

918
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:33,500
Oh, I was freaking spam and be

919
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,100
No

920
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,100
That was the fucking run

921
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,500
No, wait, I'm alive

922
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,380
Oh, no, this can't be I was alive

923
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:55,420
This whole time I was alive. I thought he died. I just gave up

924
01:19:57,820 --> 01:20:00,460
I don't know if that other reefling gave up for the fairest

925
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:05,740
Oh my god

926
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:10,860
Relentless that was literally one HP

927
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:18,540
That was one HP in a freaking ring. Why why do I have a notification on youtube?

928
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:21,660
Congrats

929
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,980
Oh

930
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:30,140
YouTube says new copyright match copyright match found. Yeah, I'm just lost the game TV

931
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:33,180
I just lost the game

932
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:36,140
Overnote thank you for the five. Wait, what?

933
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:40,140
It'll be someone that's clipping me

934
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:45,740
YouTube it'll be someone that's clipped with me. Yeah, literally someone clipped me

935
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:51,500
Their title is called pvstroni turns you in our puppy. Oh steady on steady on

936
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,740
Wait, relax

937
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:59,260
YouTube you're so dramatic. It's like this person's stealing your no youtube. That's a highlight

938
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:05,980
That's that's called a highlight of it. Hey, jeez. Anyway, anyway

939
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:12,060
This crossbow will create the heavens at bear

940
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:14,620
right

941
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,620
Russian you've been in twice. I think

942
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,300
shame

943
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:26,460
Oh my god, I'm gonna sing my ears because I'm having to wear a headset all day well

944
01:21:27,020 --> 01:21:32,540
Having to wear is a bit of a dramatic chair. Your name is chair

945
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:36,940
Chair chair has come into the pre

946
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,260
YouTube when their own system

947
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:47,100
Literally, I don't mind clipping at all. I remember people like we're like, what's the rules about clipping the girls?

948
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:51,500
I'm like, uh, do you realize how much it supports the girls if you like

949
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:56,460
You know, if you have the free time and you find yourself like you've not

950
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,440
I've got anything to do but you watch the girls

951
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:06,140
Seriously become a clip channel. Not only can you monetize those clips and make money for like all the time you put into it

952
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:11,660
You can hone a craft which is editing skills, which is always needed. I cannot tell you how much editing skills are needed

953
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,060
Okay, we're doing the ritual

954
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:15,900
um

955
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,100
Like don't be afraid to click we're not like I don't know if there's other

956
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,180
Vita agencies are like, we're gonna copyright you. No, we don't do that

957
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:30,060
Like as long as you're not derogatory or anything like well, I mean the guess is just ignore anyway if it's derogatory

958
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:36,780
She will never play my name is chair. Uh, wait this other refling time out

959
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:41,660
Other refling I think your connection might be do-do

960
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,660
Okay

961
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:50,060
Don't worry fellow reflings every tribe will tire the boss out. He'll die eventually

962
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,980
We know why his name is chair. What because of this reason?

963
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,300
I think those are refling might have timed out

964
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,860
There you are stand right there

965
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,540
Okay

966
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:08,220
You get done as soon as you come in right let me get my weak crossbow

967
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,540
Okay, we're ready

968
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:21,580
Are we steady? Do we have any blessings or anything? No, just oh shit. I think I think maybe that was a slight blessing back there, but it's okay

969
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:26,220
Oh, yeah, that's right. Take that seven damage, baby

970
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,260
One and then one two three

971
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:36,780
Yeah, so on phase one his oh god, I don't like that. I don't like that. I'll do that again

972
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,780
Don't do that again

973
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,380
I'll get lit. Oh, baby

974
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,460
All right, let me take arrow

975
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,020
Wait, I'm empty

976
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,260
Why am I empty?

977
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:53,340
See this game actually so confusing

978
01:23:53,740 --> 01:24:00,060
I've selected both arrows. Sorry. If I select both arrows, it should just indiscriminately use some once one

979
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,700
Let's see if I can get poisoned down. I don't know

980
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,460
Hold on hold on

981
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,540
Oh

982
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:18,780
Okay, hold on. I might just fuck up really badly there. Hold on

983
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,700
Recovered that one

984
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,700
Okay

985
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,820
You want to see the concept art of how these came up with this one

986
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,820
Honestly

987
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,660
You're supposed to take down me

988
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,620
I'm not gonna lie. I was baiting my lips there but not on the good bait in the lip as in the

989
01:24:54,940 --> 01:25:00,220
Munkai is baiting the lips. I don't even know what this wonder is fully done. I don't remember what I put in it

990
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:06,780
How you randomly? Well, I mean at least that roof needs to peel, but you randomly changed target

991
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:08,940
I can't give up

992
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:14,700
I do like that attack though, like they're getting up and doing a spray around the circle

993
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,780
Oh, I need to heal. What am I playing at?

994
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,260
Oh, no

995
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:25,660
Every fling is down. I repeat every fling is down

996
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:28,940
We are on winter fiend

997
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:45,580
So when he stomps it's a three chicken leg leg, uh pattern

998
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,420
No

999
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:56,060
I'm not gonna waste any more ammo. I'll just melee him today. Come here. Wait, that's not really

1000
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,820
Why does chair sound like a cat?

1001
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:04,780
Huh

1002
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:07,180
Oh my squeaky chair

1003
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:09,420
Or did I misunderstand

1004
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:13,180
Right bumper and right trigger fire with left or right bolt

1005
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,820
Why

1006
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,980
Why would they have it set up?

1007
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,820
I mean

1008
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:27,420
I get it

1009
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,740
But why

1010
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,100
They mean chair's character

1011
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:35,420
Uh

1012
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:42,460
Pineapple you've known how to show make sure to eat your pineapple. No, actually you guys eat tomato

1013
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:46,620
Uh

1014
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:56,940
Does that write your name then I'm not going crazy. Do you know n before?

1015
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,700
Is there a new refund maybe major refund wants another shot

1016
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,900
Oh

1017
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:09,500
Is that

1018
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,100
Hold on

1019
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:22,540
Is that her or am I being trolled because that may be her she's fucking addicted to this game

1020
01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:24,540
Um

1021
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,300
Is that her

1022
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,140
It is

1023
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:41,660
No way. I was gonna say you're fucking addicted to this game. Is that her

1024
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:46,300
No, wait, have you already have you already completed the dlc?

1025
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,700
I

1026
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,660
Have you already completed the dlc

1027
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:58,460
It's her that helmet and weapon you recognize it

1028
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:06,460
Oh, it's so over now. Are we gonna do it? I'm still at the start too though. Have you done the the fucking tiger before?

1029
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:11,340
I should I think I should have made an account that was already ready to go

1030
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:15,260
Oh pre-workist by the way. Mm. We do pre-workist is rounded part

1031
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,300
I don't know if you've done it before

1032
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:23,580
No, but she soloed the guy. Are you joking sin is so fucking good for like

1033
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,700
one two

1034
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:28,380
three

1035
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,020
No, that was a complete message for that. Sorry. That was a different

1036
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:34,460
I don't know how to touch

1037
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:44,620
Oh, you're right, right I'll go for scarlet rock cheeky scarlet rock

1038
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:51,980
Pineapple is trying to serenade the enemy very curious tactics will it play off? We do not know. Okay. Sorry wait

1039
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:57,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no don't I'm getting better since here. Oh, wow. I just got healed

1040
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,340
Wait, you're a healer

1041
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,940
Oh, you're a healer

1042
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:13,900
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know you're trying to heal me but

1043
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:20,860
Okay, that was really fucking sin. It's not even in the lobby. Did she get stuck?

1044
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:28,380
The bouncer didn't let me in. I have my stock outside the room only you would manage that that's hilarious

1045
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:31,340
All I hear screaming outside the door

1046
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:39,820
How did you even manage that wait? I'm so sorry guys streamer bias. I want to I want to see how if sin can do it

1047
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,820
That would actually be insane

1048
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,300
Streamer bias by the way streamer bias

1049
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:47,660
I need to send in. Oh, you've not had a shot today

1050
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:56,780
Oh my god, sorry streamer bias, but I don't know why the hell I was walked to the door. I don't maybe maybe like honestly

1051
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,780
Wait, we need to look for a sin. She had a spacky ball

1052
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,620
I seek the one with a spacky ball

1053
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:10,060
Where is spacky ball

1054
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,780
What are you

1055
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:21,340
Are you down? Oh, there you are right. Let's see if sin can we've got ty lord and sin

1056
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,500
I do oh wait

1057
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:30,460
Look, look, look. He's got the mask of the enemy. So surely ty lord knows what to do

1058
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:34,780
Surely and if sin sold this boss just as a warning though

1059
01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:41,420
There's severe lag and you are severely debuffed. Okay, I don't know why you weren't allowed in though right now

1060
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,220
and

1061
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:46,220
And then traverse limits

1062
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,660
I love when it's like yeah, you did sip and damage, I'm like damn straight

1063
01:30:55,100 --> 01:31:01,340
Okay completely absolutely oh no, no, no, no, my my my my my my my my my my my my my我的

1064
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:07,460
My souls, I just lost 500 fricking 500,000 souls because of that.

1065
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:08,460
Lol.

1066
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:12,540
Okay, let's try it again, and you come sentin'.

1067
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,540
How?

1068
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:18,540
He's so mean, he needs to stop lockin' onto me.

1069
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:22,140
Right, no, we need to see the capabilities of Sin.

1070
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:25,100
I know she's gonna go absolutely berserk.

1071
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:29,020
We need to wait for Sin to show up, because seriously, I know she's gonna fuckin' rip

1072
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:32,020
up on my new one.

1073
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:36,020
Wow, wow, wow.

1074
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:40,020
El Bereth, you've not had a shot.

1075
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:47,020
Who, Ty, Lord, I do apologize, you just got millisecond and then I completely balls up.

1076
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:49,020
Where is she?

1077
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:51,020
Where is she?

1078
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:54,020
I can smell her.

1079
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:55,020
Oh.

1080
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,020
Oh, it's you for music.

1081
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:03,020
Okay, we have our champion, don't blow steam up Mars like this.

1082
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:06,020
If you soloed this boss, you're actually insane.

1083
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,020
Did you start on a new account or anything?

1084
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:14,020
She's gone gollum.

1085
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:16,020
Honestly.

1086
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:17,020
Honestly.

1087
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:20,020
Right, okay, we're ready to see.

1088
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:25,020
I am gonna, well, it doesn't matter now, I don't need the souls, so I don't really need to do anything.

1089
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:29,020
I'm gonna let him target someone.

1090
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:34,020
Uh, uh, one.

1091
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:37,020
Oh, I was far too early on that one, I'm not gonna lie.

1092
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:39,020
Okay, Sin is in the battle dome.

1093
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:42,020
I repeat, Sin is in the battle dome.

1094
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:43,020
Oh, I've taken aggro.

1095
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:45,020
That's okay though.

1096
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:47,020
I'm allowed to take aggro.

1097
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,020
And he doesn't fuck with me.

1098
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:55,020
The other reefling is stuck outside the battle dome, unfortunately.

1099
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:57,020
Oh no.

1100
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,020
Oh no, I need to heal.

1101
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:01,020
I need to heal, I'm already throwing.

1102
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:06,020
Okay, the second reefling did make it inside the battle dome, all is good, all is wise.

1103
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:09,020
We have a lot of aggro going on.

1104
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:11,020
Okay, we have magic reefling.

1105
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:15,020
There's gonna be a lot of aggro switching, she says, as the aggro has been swapped.

1106
01:33:15,020 --> 01:33:19,020
The guards are to be wrong, the aggro has been swapped.

1107
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:26,020
There is gonna be a lot of aggro switching.

1108
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:29,020
Wow.

1109
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,020
Do I need taunt?

1110
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:37,020
I'm like, do I need to put on that taunt trinket and just run around like a crazy person?

1111
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:40,020
Because only crazy people can run.

1112
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:43,020
You know that's how it works.

1113
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:46,020
Okay, Sin does heal up.

1114
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:49,020
We're about to hit phase two lightning.

1115
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:53,020
Need to be careful, need to be careful.

1116
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:56,020
Okay, I hate when he's up because he doesn't do it.

1117
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:02,020
Okay, her person is taking all of the fucking aggro.

1118
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:06,020
He's not even looking at me, I'm gonna regret saying that.

1119
01:34:06,020 --> 01:34:15,020
I literally hook, lane, and sinkered myself to do that.

1120
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:25,020
Okay, again, it's so hard to see who he's charging the attack up for.

1121
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:30,020
Okay, let's see if I can take aggro off them, I don't want to get hurt too much.

1122
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:37,020
We are below 50% health.

1123
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:44,020
I am going for the Scarlet Mortuce!

1124
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:49,020
That was a fucking Christmas miracle, I dodged those other two attacks.

1125
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:54,020
Oh, I got caught up in that one but it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1126
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:57,020
I still have some...

1127
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:03,020
I think maybe I need to poison, I don't know.

1128
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:13,020
They're flippin' about so much, it's like making my crossbows like undoable.

1129
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:15,020
Okay, I need to be careful here.

1130
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:19,020
I said I need to be careful here!

1131
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:24,020
Okay, okay, okay, take your time.

1132
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:30,020
Let's go for poison damage now on our crossbows.

1133
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:40,020
I have aggro, that's okay, that's okay, that is okay.

1134
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:49,020
I'm poppin' my physics, don't know what it does, but I'm poppin' it anyway.

1135
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:53,020
How do you even come up with boss music, dude?

1136
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:57,020
Not good, I'm down to one health to seek.

1137
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:04,020
God, I think we're all weak, I think we're out of heals.

1138
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:11,020
This team is tired, this is the best I got.

1139
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:15,020
Oh, wow, how did I even dodge that? That was by accident.

1140
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:21,020
I'm not even gonna pretend otherwise, I dodged that by accident.

1141
01:36:21,020 --> 01:36:29,020
Oh, no, not like this, not like this.

1142
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:32,020
Didn't that cheeky poison damage?

1143
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:38,020
I'm out, and for that reason, I'm out.

1144
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:41,020
Not the light, man.

1145
01:36:41,020 --> 01:36:47,020
Holy shit, me and fuckin' Senna in sync, we're doing the exact same thing as each other.

1146
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:50,020
Holy fuck.

1147
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:54,020
Me, like, it literally means Senna's fucking synced up there, did you see that?

1148
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:56,020
The way we were moving around the battlefield?

1149
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:59,020
You didn't even know what I was doing from behind.

1150
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:05,020
Holy crap, if you still had Bleedbolt, I think I'm out.

1151
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:12,020
Got Flame, I got Poison, I got Ritusei, I got Lightning and Fire.

1152
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:16,020
I don't know what he's resistant to.

1153
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:19,020
Sorry, resistant to.

1154
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:21,020
Okay, let me see, sure.

1155
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:23,020
Is Senna wanting to go again? I think so.

1156
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:25,020
Could you imagine if we do it a bit?

1157
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:30,020
None other than the hit streamers, Senna.

1158
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:40,020
Uh, you even know how to show, actually, Tyler, do you need Senna to do a show?

1159
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:44,020
I love it when Senna knows she dies, it still goes in.

1160
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:49,020
Literally, she's the bravest of us all.

1161
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:56,020
She's probably ready to whack me being like, what are you doing, not helping in the fight?

1162
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,020
Yeah, we're done.

1163
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:07,020
After this, you should have a refling take cue to sign Ciclida's fragments to basically help you get scaled up with the bosses.

1164
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:12,020
Oh no, is Sen region? Does she need a moment? Avenge me.

1165
01:38:12,020 --> 01:38:14,020
Oh no, is Senna, is that all the time you had?

1166
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:16,020
Rip, rip, rip, rip. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1167
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:19,020
Thank you for hanging reflings.

1168
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:22,020
Thank you for hanging Senna, that was absolutely fucking amazing.

1169
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:29,020
I was like, wait, there's like a high likelihood that actually is her, because you're so fucking good at Elden Ring, honestly.

1170
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:33,020
Okay, we're giving you a six, you can't rip.

1171
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:35,020
Is Senna certified refling?

1172
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:38,020
Well, I'm a certified imp.

1173
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:40,020
So, yeah.

1174
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:43,020
I'd say we're pretty on par for one another.

1175
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,020
She almost carried, no, she did carry, joking me.

1176
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,020
Right, mwah, mwah.

1177
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:51,020
We've got a spell, oh, another one.

1178
01:38:51,020 --> 01:38:53,020
Another one, and we go.

1179
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:55,020
And we go, I say we go.

1180
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:59,020
I'm sorry, mummy, I was late to the last one.

1181
01:38:59,020 --> 01:39:01,020
Don't worry.

1182
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:08,020
The good news is, well, someone took Agil instantly.

1183
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:18,020
Let's build up the rotisserie, and then we'll do build up the poison.

1184
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:26,020
Big wall lips, big wall lips all around, not gonna lie.

1185
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:28,020
Mwah!

1186
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:31,020
Someone got a bleed off.

1187
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,020
Right, we're gonna swap to the other one now.

1188
01:39:33,020 --> 01:39:39,020
We're gonna swap to poison, see if that even does anything.

1189
01:39:39,020 --> 01:39:45,020
Doesn't feel like poison's really doing too much.

1190
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:47,020
That's okay.

1191
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:52,020
We're getting twerked on.

1192
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:54,020
Literally, that refling literally just got twerked on.

1193
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:56,020
I'm sure you all saw that.

1194
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:58,020
In real time, in real time.

1195
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:05,020
Well, someone got ultimate, Eldritch.

1196
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:08,020
Can he not take damage when he's in that state?

1197
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:11,020
Oh no, he can't be.

1198
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:17,020
Strongly imps in refling, honestly.

1199
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:26,020
I'm, like, smiling and, like, biting my lips.

1200
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:28,020
Because it's, like, just so good.

1201
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,020
Like, I'm not even mad.

1202
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:35,020
I'm, like, it's just, like, in awe of this boss thing.

1203
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:45,020
Did you stagger him there?

1204
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:51,020
Okay, I don't, I don't know if he's even afflicted.

1205
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,020
Mwah!

1206
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,020
I'm not even sure he's afflicted with rotisserie.

1207
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:05,020
I'm trying to make sure there's not so much aggro on the other refling at any one point!

1208
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:21,020
Uh, sorry, I feel like literally focused to see what cues the game was giving me to let me...

1209
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:26,020
To let me get away with it.

1210
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:32,020
Oh no, no, no, not like this!

1211
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,020
Not like this, refling!

1212
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:42,020
Uh, I don't even have an excuse why I didn't respond in time to that one.

1213
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:47,020
Hey!

1214
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,020
Hey!

1215
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:01,020
Oh, the lightning got me!

1216
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:06,020
Oh no! Right, okay, okay.

1217
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:11,020
Oh, I can't even, I will actually want to let him kill me.

1218
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:15,020
And I can't even get close to him, from the Nile he is.

1219
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,020
Wow, we can do it, we can do it.

1220
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:20,020
I'm sorry, I don't care if the stream turns into 12 hours of this.

1221
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:23,020
I know for a fact we can do it.

1222
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:28,020
She's suffering, but she likes it. Damn, guess I'm still too easy from waking up.

1223
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:30,020
Bro got eight.

1224
01:42:30,020 --> 01:42:33,020
You're allowed to be eaten with it, boss.

1225
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:42,020
It's been a couple of hours now, and little coachwoman still hasn't yet defeated Big Matt.

1226
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:48,020
Well, if you want to come defeat him for us, you're more than welcome to.

1227
01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:56,020
Just to tell you, you did get a second chance.

1228
01:42:56,020 --> 01:42:59,020
Um, I'm very sorry, I cannot recall.

1229
01:43:00,020 --> 01:43:02,020
F, no, that's MPP.

1230
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:11,020
I can't recall if you had a good attempt or not, and you're one.

1231
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:14,020
You were recent, you're like very recent.

1232
01:43:15,020 --> 01:43:19,020
Rushing on the 6th, you've had a few 10s.

1233
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:23,020
Major refund, I think you only had one attempt, you did, you've not had a second.

1234
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:26,020
I'm trying to make it as fair as possible.

1235
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:28,020
You know the rules, you know-

1236
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:01,020
They're never gonna leave me.

1237
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:03,020
That's the sentence.

1238
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:07,020
Lightning, let's get fire and lightning, thunder bolts and lightning.

1239
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:09,020
Very, very frightening.

1240
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,020
Galileo, Galileo.

1241
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:13,020
And bolts too.

1242
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:16,020
Oh wait, we got bleed bolts, hold on, we got bleed bolts.

1243
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:21,020
And we've all been dying.

1244
01:44:23,020 --> 01:44:27,020
Not gonna lie, I don't think this is the game that wants me to be summoned.

1245
01:44:27,020 --> 01:44:29,020
Are you on PC?

1246
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:34,020
And are you using the code Reef in the multiplayer section?

1247
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:40,020
Right, we'll do raw and we'll do fire, cause he doesn't use fire.

1248
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:46,020
So by video game logic, but the multiplayer password up there is just Reef in capital letters.

1249
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:49,020
And you should show up.

1250
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:54,020
Oh, more bleed, tons more bleed.

1251
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,020
Well, I guess we're bleeding this guy's to death.

1252
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:58,020
Okay, pre-work is-

1253
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:03,020
Okay, let's go.

1254
01:45:04,020 --> 01:45:07,020
I'm playing on PS5, oh it's not cross play.

1255
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:11,020
Well, Reefland is not cross play.

1256
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:15,020
You have been misled, you've been led astray by the lies.

1257
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:21,020
Okay, let him get up, let him get up.

1258
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:24,020
Big dive, big dive, big double dive.

1259
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:26,020
Hit me with a triple dive.

1260
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:31,020
Okay, triple on the dives, I repeat, triple on the dives.

1261
01:45:31,020 --> 01:45:36,020
Magic Reefling is swapping that aggro but does get picked on.

1262
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:38,020
Are we all far away?

1263
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:40,020
All of us are far away.

1264
01:45:40,020 --> 01:45:44,020
Oh no, this can't be, all of us attack from far away.

1265
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,020
I mean, he's already down to lightning phase.

1266
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:51,020
Did we not just enter this battle, Amina?

1267
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:56,020
But I'm getting there.

1268
01:45:57,020 --> 01:46:00,020
I'm taking aggro, big jump.

1269
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:04,020
Second attack, third attack with a butt swipe or something.

1270
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:08,020
Posting off the butt swipe, lightning bolt, same thing.

1271
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:12,020
Oh, he's got raw, I think I just saw raw effects on him.

1272
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:15,020
I don't have bleed on him but...

1273
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:20,020
Is that for me? No.

1274
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:24,020
It's so hard to see who he's wanting to look onto.

1275
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:27,020
Looks like it's on Mage Reefling.

1276
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:31,020
Oh no, it's me, my turn.

1277
01:46:32,020 --> 01:46:34,020
My turn.

1278
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:37,020
Good, good, good.

1279
01:46:39,020 --> 01:46:43,020
Not good, this one is not good because it's so fucking hard to dodge.

1280
01:46:44,020 --> 01:46:46,020
I think we're being rocked from the floor.

1281
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:49,020
Again, one, and then...

1282
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:52,020
A whirlwind swipe?

1283
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:56,020
No, aggro changed.

1284
01:46:56,020 --> 01:46:58,020
Aggro changed.

1285
01:46:59,020 --> 01:47:02,020
Aggro changed to Mage.

1286
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:07,020
No, I always fucked that one up.

1287
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:11,020
Holy shit, you guys did it, you knocked him down.

1288
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:15,020
All it took was three long range reeflings.

1289
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:20,020
Holy shit.

1290
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:22,020
I believe.

1291
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:27,020
I believe, I believe, I have faith in the reeflings, I have faith in their hearts.

1292
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:30,020
Deep down they know they can do it.

1293
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:36,020
They have the strength, I believe, I believe, I believe.

1294
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:40,020
Got reeflings, oh my god.

1295
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:46,020
Remembrance of the dancing lion, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.

1296
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,020
Thank you reeflings, thank you.

1297
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:51,020
Wow, what did the boss draw?

1298
01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:53,020
His head.

1299
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:55,020
Up with his head.

1300
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:58,020
Does this give me better stuff?

1301
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:05,020
Wow, that looks very scary.

1302
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:11,020
Yeah, that's what you get for making this take so long.

1303
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:14,020
Oh, I don't like it, it's actually kind of scary though.

1304
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:22,020
Bro, the major reefing put in unholy work, really?

1305
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:26,020
I can hardly tell, because it's getting very well.

1306
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:29,020
Can I, I can't ride horsey through here.

1307
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:31,020
Oh, it's an elevator, okay.

1308
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:36,020
Wait, hold on, let me get my sword out, you know, like the actual thing that I swing about.

1309
01:48:36,020 --> 01:48:37,020
Where is it?

1310
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:38,020
Where is it?

1311
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,020
Here I am.

1312
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:41,020
And then hold.

1313
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,020
Let's explore.

1314
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:52,020
Because I can't have this spell he uses OP.

1315
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:54,020
What, the moon beam?

1316
01:48:54,020 --> 01:48:56,020
What a good boss fight.

1317
01:48:56,020 --> 01:48:58,020
Ooh, that's fire.

1318
01:48:58,020 --> 01:49:00,020
Ma, thank you for the gifted membership.

1319
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:03,020
Congrats to those who caught it in your face.

1320
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:05,020
Thanks again, Ma.

1321
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:11,020
Wait, if that was celebration for the boss fight, why I didn't do any other work?

1322
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:14,020
I didn't do a single bit of the work.

1323
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:18,020
Ooh.

1324
01:49:24,020 --> 01:49:25,020
Okay.

1325
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:27,020
Oh, there's a remembrance here.

1326
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:29,020
I need to go back and get that one.

1327
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:31,020
Reverence spirit, I shall live.

1328
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:34,020
Is this bowling ball alley?

1329
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:39,020
Or is the game actually going to give us a section with no enemies?

1330
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:42,020
Or am I giving the game too much faith for you to let me do that?

1331
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:45,020
That's madness that's coming out of the urge tree.

1332
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:48,020
It looks like it anyway.

1333
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:51,020
A house of thorns, I guess?

1334
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:53,020
Overgrown roots.

1335
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,020
Hello?

1336
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:57,020
Are you okay?

1337
01:49:57,020 --> 01:50:00,020
Oh, tower of ours, hidden in shadow.

1338
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:03,020
Oh, lofty spiral piercing the heavens.

1339
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:08,020
Lead him safely unto greater godhood.

1340
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:11,020
And in divinity, grant our salvation.

1341
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,020
Curious.

1342
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:15,020
Curious.

1343
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:17,020
You actually did take a bit of aggro off the last fight.

1344
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:19,020
Did I actually?

1345
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:22,020
I just fucking...

1346
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:25,020
I'm just firing my laser.

1347
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:27,020
And by laser, I...

1348
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:35,020
Why is there so much blood here?

1349
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:37,020
Tower of shadow message.

1350
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:39,020
We'll just read it.

1351
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:50,020
The gate of divinity lies in the tower sealed by shadow.

1352
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:55,020
That is truly where Khaind Mekela is headed.

1353
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:58,020
We are no MP...

1354
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:03,020
MP Reans, but we must locate the path that we deserve.

1355
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:06,020
And follow the process...

1356
01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:15,020
Is it a fake wall?

1357
01:51:15,020 --> 01:51:17,020
Not fake wall.

1358
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:19,020
What?

1359
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:27,020
I've been dumb and I'm just to cut the...

1360
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:33,020
Wait, did I interact with the front?

1361
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:39,020
Huh.

1362
01:51:39,020 --> 01:51:42,020
Sealed and obscured by a shadow.

1363
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:45,020
You have to proceed elsewhere.

1364
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:47,020
Okay.

1365
01:51:47,020 --> 01:51:54,020
We can't progress at this castle area.

1366
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:58,020
So we will...

1367
01:51:58,020 --> 01:52:03,020
We'll go across the bridge.

1368
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:05,020
We've not gone across the bridge.

1369
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:07,020
Go to the three path cross.

1370
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:10,020
And then we'll go across the bridge and all that.

1371
01:52:10,020 --> 01:52:14,020
Same for the reefling flattening.

1372
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:19,020
Oh, hello. Do you talk to me?

1373
01:52:19,020 --> 01:52:21,020
If you've yet to do so.

1374
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:25,020
Okay, I have a reefling.

1375
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:28,020
Okay, I do my little explore list.

1376
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:33,020
Because boss fights don't really count.

1377
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:37,020
Because it's just like a whack after a whack.

1378
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:40,020
But exploring is like you get to do a lot.

1379
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:44,020
Arrow delivery? No way.

1380
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:49,020
That's funny as anything.

1381
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:51,020
Arrow delivery.

1382
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:53,020
Oh, I need an enemy reefling to come here.

1383
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:57,020
If anyone's at the three path cross.

1384
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:02,020
Reefling flattening, more like reefling,

1385
01:53:02,020 --> 01:53:05,020
flapping in, am I right fellas?

1386
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:08,020
Thank you.

1387
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:10,020
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

1388
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,020
Okay, I got an enemy reefling too.

1389
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:16,020
I don't really know if I should put down the enemy reefling.

1390
01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:18,020
But I'll just try.

1391
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:20,020
Because I guess you get to still adventure.

1392
01:53:20,020 --> 01:53:23,020
Just because you're like a whack.

1393
01:53:23,020 --> 01:53:25,020
Boo.

1394
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:27,020
Oh, you want pre-ritual?

1395
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:30,020
Does arrow delivery want pre-ritual?

1396
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:39,020
That arrow delivery guy just like actually.

1397
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:43,020
Holy, Rainbow Stone Shattered Bloodborne Fletch.

1398
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:45,020
Did we do Fletching up in here?

1399
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:47,020
4000 Fletch.

1400
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:49,020
Oh, someone actually said that.

1401
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:52,020
They were hoping I'd do more RuneScape after.

1402
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:54,020
Okay, we got the pre-ritual down.

1403
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:56,020
Oh my God.

1404
01:53:56,020 --> 01:53:57,020
Did you just...

1405
01:53:57,020 --> 01:54:00,020
I've got a Gollum Great Boat Crab.

1406
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:06,020
Look at me.

1407
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:08,020
You want to lie down too?

1408
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:10,020
Reefling?

1409
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:12,020
Oh, you're dropping stuff for me.

1410
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:14,020
More bones.

1411
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:16,020
So many bones.

1412
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:18,020
Eh, bones.

1413
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,020
Sorry, not bones.

1414
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,020
Sorry, one of them has bones in the tail.

1415
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:22,020
Ready?

1416
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:24,020
Let's do a big run up.

1417
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,020
Because we did fantastic on that boss fight.

1418
01:54:31,020 --> 01:54:33,020
Perfect.

1419
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:35,020
I will just hold on to...

1420
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:37,020
Oh, he went for it.

1421
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:38,020
A fire dra...

1422
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:40,020
Oh, talisman.

1423
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:42,020
Hold on.

1424
01:54:42,020 --> 01:54:48,020
Are these talisman go together and...

1425
01:54:48,020 --> 01:54:49,020
Wait, hold on.

1426
01:54:49,020 --> 01:54:50,020
Equipment.

1427
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:51,020
Talisman.

1428
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:55,020
Are these complimentary to the bolts?

1429
01:54:55,020 --> 01:55:01,020
Nay fire and nay magic against me.

1430
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:02,020
That...

1431
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:05,020
Honestly, that seems pretty good at the line.

1432
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:06,020
Oh, more.

1433
01:55:06,020 --> 01:55:09,020
Oh, an arrow talisman for when we do bosses.

1434
01:55:09,020 --> 01:55:11,020
I'll swap when we do bosses.

1435
01:55:11,020 --> 01:55:14,020
Okay, we need to...

1436
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:18,020
go across the bridge, which Reefling's already done working with.

1437
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:21,020
I have to get some drinks next, actually.

1438
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:23,020
Didn't expect so many clips from yesterday.

1439
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:25,020
Azura's wanting to lick your face.

1440
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:28,020
Bruh, I was like, how steaming is she?

1441
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:31,020
But I think everyone's good to go.

1442
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:35,020
Speaking of everyone being good to go, how dare they?

1443
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:42,020
Oh, okay, hold on.

1444
01:55:42,020 --> 01:55:45,020
Hold on, I have something funny to show you.

1445
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:46,020
Are you ready?

1446
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:47,020
Sorry for your...

1447
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:48,020
I'm fucking charred.

1448
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:50,020
I'm not even going to pretend.

1449
01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:51,020
I'm not even going to pretend.

1450
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:53,020
I'm absolutely dying.

1451
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:55,020
But like, the good came to die and not the bad came.

1452
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:57,020
Like, I want to be here came to die.

1453
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:58,020
Are you ready for this?

1454
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:03,020
You know how we're playing Belcher next week?

1455
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:04,020
Yeah.

1456
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,020
What do you think?

1457
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:11,020
I'm going to get those assets and use them.

1458
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:14,020
What would you think for a thumbnail?

1459
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:16,020
Mummy's betting the hoot.

1460
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:21,020
My poor little Reeflings are going to either be in a cardboard box or not.

1461
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:24,020
It's time to...

1462
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:26,020
Well, it's time to...

1463
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:27,020
Belcher.

1464
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:28,020
Belcher.

1465
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:30,020
Belcher doesn't really work.

1466
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:31,020
Belcher.

1467
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:32,020
Any Belcher?

1468
01:56:32,020 --> 01:56:34,020
I'm a Belcher.

1469
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:36,020
That's pretty good.

1470
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:39,020
Mummy's going to be spending all the milk money.

1471
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:41,020
Let's go.

1472
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:42,020
I like that.

1473
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:44,020
Come back because you dodged.

1474
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:45,020
Dome.

1475
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:46,020
Dome.

1476
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:47,020
Dome.

1477
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:48,020
Sometimes.

1478
01:56:48,020 --> 01:56:49,020
Dome.

1479
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:50,020
Dome.

1480
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,020
Dome.

1481
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:52,020
Dome.

1482
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,020
Dome.

1483
01:56:53,020 --> 01:56:54,020
Dome.

1484
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:55,020
Dome.

1485
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:56,020
Dome.

1486
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,020
Dome.

1487
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:58,020
Dome.

1488
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,020
Dome.

1489
01:56:59,020 --> 01:57:00,020
Dome.

1490
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:01,020
Dome.

1491
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,020
Dome.

1492
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:03,020
Dome.

1493
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:04,020
Dome.

1494
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:05,020
Dome.

1495
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:06,020
Dome.

1496
01:57:06,020 --> 01:57:07,020
Dome.

1497
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:08,020
Dome.

1498
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:09,020
Dome.

1499
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:10,020
Dome.

1500
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:11,020
Dome.

1501
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:12,020
Dome.

1502
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:13,020
Dome.

1503
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:14,020
Dome.

1504
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:15,020
Dome.

1505
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:16,020
Dome.

1506
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:17,020
Tome.

1507
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:18,020
Dome.

1508
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:19,020
Dome.

1509
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:20,020
Dome.

1510
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:21,020
Dome.

1511
01:57:21,020 --> 01:57:22,020
Dome.

1512
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:26,020
Maybe it's a warning to not actually come here.

1513
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:30,020
Lost ashes of war.

1514
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:40,020
Okay, we appear to be doing a bit of pillaging.

1515
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:44,020
There's actual things with humanity.

1516
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:50,020
I'm helping, I'm helping, I'm not even gonna hit yet, I'm helping, I'm helping.

1517
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:56,020
I'm putting my great sword on right now.

1518
01:57:56,020 --> 01:58:00,020
It has so much more reach.

1519
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:04,020
Scottish English seems to be its own language.

1520
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:08,020
I have such good news for you.

1521
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:12,020
No, the British government acknowledges it.

1522
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:16,020
Fire spark perfume bottle.

1523
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:18,020
Someone's getting hurt.

1524
01:58:18,020 --> 01:58:22,020
Wait, Arrow Delivery is getting hurt. Where's Arrow? Help Arrow!

1525
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:28,020
Why? Okay, he's dead.

1526
01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:30,020
Oh, another item.

1527
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:36,020
Ooh, a skadoot leaf fragment.

1528
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:38,020
What, when did this game get to French?

1529
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:42,020
Skadoot leaf.

1530
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:46,020
How did I manage to claim that when you were so close?

1531
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:48,020
Oh no, you're getting boring.

1532
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:52,020
Anyone want some calamari?

1533
01:58:52,020 --> 01:58:54,020
Perfume bottles are weapon?

1534
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:58,020
Oh my god, this is such a girl's game.

1535
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:04,020
Oh, no, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

1536
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:08,020
It's just a harder one that's in the main area.

1537
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:10,020
He's got armor.

1538
01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:12,020
Why is he looking at me? I'm getting nervous.

1539
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:14,020
Okay, that's what I wanted to see.

1540
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:16,020
Oh no, you made him fall down.

1541
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:18,020
He's embarrassed.

1542
01:59:18,020 --> 01:59:24,020
He's going to think about this moment for the rest of his life because he fell down in front of us.

1543
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:28,020
Wah.

1544
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:30,020
Wah.

1545
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:36,020
I'm out of stamina. Hold on, let me get to it.

1546
01:59:36,020 --> 01:59:40,020
Wah. Oh wait, we got a critical?

1547
01:59:40,020 --> 01:59:42,020
Oh, we got a critical, alright.

1548
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:45,020
Wah.

1549
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:46,020
He's so stumpy.

1550
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:48,020
Okay, we did it, we did it.

1551
01:59:48,020 --> 01:59:52,020
Woah, that's not friendly.

1552
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:59,020
I got a somber smithing stone from his body.

1553
01:59:59,020 --> 02:00:04,020
Wait, you can actually farm crafting heroes now?

1554
02:00:04,020 --> 02:00:09,020
A shadow realm rune.

1555
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:12,020
Yeah, so grossly the bosses claim weird personality.

1556
02:00:12,020 --> 02:00:14,020
I regret ascending that.

1557
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:16,020
Honestly, true.

1558
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:21,020
When have we never regretted a few cheeky comments?

1559
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:22,020
Then you overthink it.

1560
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:24,020
When you go to bed tonight, we be fun.

1561
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:31,020
Then you'd be like, remember that time I did that cringe message in Stony's chat.

1562
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:34,020
Then you worry.

1563
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:38,020
And then when you do think of it, just giggle because I'm giggling with you.

1564
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:42,020
Oh my god, a stagger timber there.

1565
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:45,020
Woah, woah, woah!

1566
02:00:45,020 --> 02:00:47,020
Am I going crazy?

1567
02:00:48,020 --> 02:00:52,020
I need better armor yesterday.

1568
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:59,020
Wait, so you can finally farm crafting heroes?

1569
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:01,020
Is there something up here?

1570
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:02,020
Oh my god!

1571
02:01:02,020 --> 02:01:05,020
The name's McCree, Jesse McCree.

1572
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:07,020
It's Harmu.

1573
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:08,020
I'm playing Fatball.

1574
02:01:08,020 --> 02:01:11,020
Sorry, sorry, I'm playing Fatball, a weed dust thing that are real.

1575
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:13,020
I thought those things weren't real.

1576
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,020
Is it tumbleweeds?

1577
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:15,020
Yeah, tumbleweeds.

1578
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:17,020
I thought tumbleweeds weren't real.

1579
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:22,020
What's inside?

1580
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:23,020
What?

1581
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:25,020
Inside the box.

1582
02:01:27,020 --> 02:01:28,020
Milady?

1583
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:30,020
Oh, that's so cool.

1584
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,020
Milady.

1585
02:01:32,020 --> 02:01:34,020
Come, Milady, come, come, Milady.

1586
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:36,020
Give me a sugar flat.

1587
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:39,020
Then a McCree, right?

1588
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,020
Jesse McCree.

1589
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:43,020
Wait, no, the meme!

1590
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:47,020
I don't have a hat that will go dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk on the thing.

1591
02:01:48,020 --> 02:01:50,020
Oh well, we tried.

1592
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:55,020
Tips for Dora, Milady.

1593
02:01:55,020 --> 02:02:00,020
The lion head is cool and it gives like five strength and dexterity, but it debuffs here.

1594
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:01,020
I don't know that.

1595
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:05,020
What's the naughty thing that it does to you?

1596
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:07,020
Why?

1597
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:09,020
I thought that was an enemy.

1598
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:11,020
I thought that was a cheeky enemy, not going to lie.

1599
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:14,020
It's coming from an ankle.

1600
02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:17,020
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1601
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:24,020
Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go on to do look more like?

1602
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:27,020
What?

1603
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:31,020
What did he say?

1604
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:33,020
Is that true?

1605
02:02:33,020 --> 02:02:34,020
Has anyone...

1606
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:36,020
Is that an acronym?

1607
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:40,020
H-A-R-B-E

1608
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:42,020
Part of the...

1609
02:02:42,020 --> 02:02:44,020
Okay, so it's not an acronym.

1610
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:47,020
Are you havin' a stroke?

1611
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:50,020
Thank you for the 20s, ask the question.

1612
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:51,020
Are you okay?

1613
02:02:52,020 --> 02:02:53,020
Oh yeah.

1614
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:56,020
Carved words.

1615
02:02:56,020 --> 02:02:58,020
I abandon here the flesh of my body.

1616
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:04,020
Oh, I guess that fragment is her body.

1617
02:03:04,020 --> 02:03:06,020
She's giving body, ary, ary, ary, ary, ary, ary.

1618
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:07,020
Yeah, I didn't know that.

1619
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,020
A lot of people hear that.

1620
02:03:10,020 --> 02:03:11,020
Yeah, you like that.

1621
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:12,020
You like the way I...

1622
02:03:12,020 --> 02:03:15,020
I have my slave reeflings.

1623
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:17,020
They're all the work.

1624
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:20,020
They're just so perfect and submissive

1625
02:03:20,020 --> 02:03:23,020
and carry me and let me hold their hand

1626
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:25,020
and praise them and call them a good boy.

1627
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:27,020
Yeah, oh, whoa.

1628
02:03:29,020 --> 02:03:30,020
It's really a...

1629
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:31,020
It's like getting the whole...

1630
02:03:31,020 --> 02:03:32,020
What?

1631
02:03:32,020 --> 02:03:35,020
I don't know, application, you don't need to be off, it's okay.

1632
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:38,020
What?

1633
02:03:38,020 --> 02:03:39,020
Okay, I think we're safe.

1634
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:41,020
Hold on, let me put my wee light on.

1635
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:43,020
There we go.

1636
02:03:44,020 --> 02:03:45,020
He's not having a stroke.

1637
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:47,020
Wait, is that an actual sentence structure?

1638
02:03:47,020 --> 02:03:48,020
It's a really old meme.

1639
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:49,020
Oh.

1640
02:03:51,020 --> 02:03:52,020
What are we?

1641
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:53,020
Not this way?

1642
02:03:53,020 --> 02:03:54,020
Oh no, the reeflings are split.

1643
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:55,020
What way are we going?

1644
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:57,020
Oh, that's the animal.

1645
02:03:58,020 --> 02:04:00,020
Right, someone's just gone on the waterfall

1646
02:04:00,020 --> 02:04:01,020
and another one's gone there.

1647
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:02,020
Which way is it?

1648
02:04:02,020 --> 02:04:04,020
Right, he's got a fire.

1649
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:06,020
He says, come this way, he's got a fire reefling.

1650
02:04:06,020 --> 02:04:08,020
Come reefling, he says he's got a fire.

1651
02:04:09,020 --> 02:04:10,020
Which way is it?

1652
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:11,020
Oh!

1653
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:14,020
There's a jump ahead reefling back there.

1654
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:16,020
Don't forget to jump, please.

1655
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:17,020
Seriously.

1656
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:19,020
Oh, to get an item?

1657
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:21,020
What is it?

1658
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:23,020
I got a starlight shard.

1659
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:25,020
Okay, it was just a wee thing.

1660
02:04:25,020 --> 02:04:26,020
Wee.

1661
02:04:26,020 --> 02:04:27,020
Wee.

1662
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:29,020
Okay, I got it, I got it.

1663
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:30,020
One at a time.

1664
02:04:30,020 --> 02:04:31,020
Single fail, people.

1665
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:32,020
Single fail.

1666
02:04:32,020 --> 02:04:33,020
This is a cliff face.

1667
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:34,020
What makes you think we should go

1668
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:36,020
three by three on the side?

1669
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:37,020
You know what I'm saying?

1670
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:39,020
Single fail.

1671
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:40,020
Easy.

1672
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:41,020
Easy.

1673
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:42,020
Easy.

1674
02:04:42,020 --> 02:04:43,020
Take it easy.

1675
02:04:44,020 --> 02:04:45,020
Easy.

1676
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:47,020
Easy.

1677
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:49,020
This is more dangerous than the time we went

1678
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,020
in the coffin down a waterfall.

1679
02:04:51,020 --> 02:04:53,020
Oh, there's a wee turtle.

1680
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:54,020
Hello.

1681
02:04:54,020 --> 02:04:55,020
Hello.

1682
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:56,020
I pet the turtle.

1683
02:04:56,020 --> 02:04:58,020
I pet it, I pet it.

1684
02:04:59,020 --> 02:05:00,020
So cute.

1685
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:01,020
Okay, sorry, sorry.

1686
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,020
Okay, we're doing a Legend of Zelda movement.

1687
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:05,020
We're going behind the waterfall.

1688
02:05:05,020 --> 02:05:06,020
I'll go over there.

1689
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:08,020
There is some sort of item here.

1690
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:11,020
Why has a...

1691
02:05:11,020 --> 02:05:14,020
Drawstring Royal Magic Hickory?

1692
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:17,020
Not to be confused with fake magic.

1693
02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:18,020
Peasant?

1694
02:05:19,020 --> 02:05:20,020
Wait, why is there a fake?

1695
02:05:20,020 --> 02:05:21,020
Oh, it's because of me.

1696
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:22,020
Sorry.

1697
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:24,020
Doll.

1698
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:25,020
Doll.

1699
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:26,020
I pet the doll.

1700
02:05:27,020 --> 02:05:28,020
As in the turtle.

1701
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,020
I pet the doll.

1702
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:32,020
I need to not do like combat actions,

1703
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:33,020
because that accidentally triggers

1704
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:35,020
aggressive music.

1705
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:38,020
Could you imagine?

1706
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:40,020
If...

1707
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:42,020
If I could turn off and reading.

1708
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:44,020
Wow, what a bizarre concept.

1709
02:05:44,020 --> 02:05:45,020
Truly.

1710
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:47,020
I'm so sorry the dev team didn't even

1711
02:05:47,020 --> 02:05:48,020
think of it until now,

1712
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:49,020
but I had to...

1713
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:51,020
Someone had to break the news to them.

1714
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:53,020
Well, we're looking at that.

1715
02:05:53,020 --> 02:05:54,020
That's a hassle.

1716
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:57,020
Oh my god, we're making flower.

1717
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,020
Push it.

1718
02:06:00,020 --> 02:06:02,020
Oh, you guys don't want to help.

1719
02:06:02,020 --> 02:06:04,020
You're making it heavier.

1720
02:06:06,020 --> 02:06:08,020
Oh my god, it's like a real cal...

1721
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:09,020
Wait.

1722
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:11,020
Why did we open it and then go up here?

1723
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,020
I don't know who the fuck I'm beating up.

1724
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:18,020
I'm beating the shit out of everyone.

1725
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:20,020
Leave my replay alone.

1726
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:23,020
I love the delay.

1727
02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:25,020
Like, I do it and then he's like...

1728
02:06:26,020 --> 02:06:28,020
A few seconds later.

1729
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:31,020
That's a good order.

1730
02:06:36,020 --> 02:06:37,020
Wow.

1731
02:06:38,020 --> 02:06:40,020
Oh, not magic in him, but magic.

1732
02:06:42,020 --> 02:06:43,020
Oh, come on.

1733
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:45,020
That makes me come out and around.

1734
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:47,020
Not even Wednesday, though.

1735
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:49,020
No, wait a minute.

1736
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:52,020
Gotta wait for the stream delay.

1737
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:57,020
This is what you guys are playing with.

1738
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:58,020
Whoa, whoa.

1739
02:06:58,020 --> 02:06:59,020
What?

1740
02:06:59,020 --> 02:07:00,020
What?

1741
02:07:00,020 --> 02:07:01,020
What?

1742
02:07:01,020 --> 02:07:02,020
What?

1743
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:04,020
This is what you guys are playing with.

1744
02:07:04,020 --> 02:07:05,020
Whoa, whoa.

1745
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:11,020
Did I miss something?

1746
02:07:14,020 --> 02:07:15,020
Did I miss something?

1747
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:16,020
Was I not full health?

1748
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:18,020
Was I like 1 HP or something?

1749
02:07:20,020 --> 02:07:23,020
Or is he all attack, no health?

1750
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:25,020
Did I miss something?

1751
02:07:25,020 --> 02:07:26,020
Was I weak?

1752
02:07:32,020 --> 02:07:34,020
I just got one shot?

1753
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:39,020
Um...

1754
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:41,020
What?

1755
02:07:42,020 --> 02:07:43,020
I got one shot?

1756
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:46,020
Where the fuck are we on the HUD?

1757
02:07:46,020 --> 02:07:48,020
We're on Castle Enius checkpoint.

1758
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:52,020
Are you guys okay if I make a quick cup of tea?

1759
02:07:54,020 --> 02:07:56,020
There's 80% health on a single...

1760
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:58,020
Literally, I blinked when I was dead.

1761
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:00,020
I was like, oh, there's an enemy.

1762
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:02,020
Um...

1763
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:04,020
Got absolutely fucking rolled.

1764
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:06,020
Um...

1765
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:07,020
Me...

1766
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:10,020
You were actually the enemy.

1767
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:12,020
Whoa, no, no.

1768
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:13,020
Sorry.

1769
02:08:13,020 --> 02:08:14,020
Uh...

1770
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:15,020
When you do this on a movie,

1771
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:17,020
don't do three books at the same time.

1772
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:20,020
Alright, you've not done a main quest with me.

1773
02:08:21,020 --> 02:08:23,020
Just rushing around...

1774
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:25,020
For somebody to...

1775
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:33,020
You've not had a main quest.

1776
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:35,020
Ooh, lollygagging with you.

1777
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:38,020
We're doing lollygagging with you.

1778
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:41,020
Arrow, you were just with us.

1779
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:42,020
Oh wait, no!

1780
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:43,020
Idiot.

1781
02:08:44,020 --> 02:08:46,020
Well, you were both with us.

1782
02:08:46,020 --> 02:08:48,020
But now you're with me again.

1783
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:50,020
Oh my god, mommy, you did it?

1784
02:08:50,020 --> 02:08:51,020
Yeah?

1785
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:53,020
I killed the lion.

1786
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:54,020
I did it solo,

1787
02:08:54,020 --> 02:08:57,020
because the reflins were holding me back.

1788
02:08:57,020 --> 02:08:58,020
They were being...

1789
02:08:58,020 --> 02:09:01,020
They just got so distracted by the view, you know?

1790
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:04,020
So I had to do it all by myself.

1791
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:08,020
And I'm totally not telling you fibbers.

1792
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:09,020
At all.

1793
02:09:10,020 --> 02:09:14,020
I'm telling you the biggest fib I have ever fibbed.

1794
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:17,020
Lying women needs immediate refling correction.

1795
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:18,020
I didn't see some,

1796
02:09:18,020 --> 02:09:19,020
I'm just gonna take a word for it.

1797
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:21,020
Do not take my word for it.

1798
02:09:21,020 --> 02:09:24,020
Alright, I'm gonna very quickly make a wee cup of tea.

1799
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:27,020
And I'm actually gonna clean out my ears,

1800
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:29,020
because I can fucking seal them.

1801
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:31,020
The view?

1802
02:09:31,020 --> 02:09:34,020
That means some refling can see from the back.

1803
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:35,020
No, you can see...

1804
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:36,020
No, this...

1805
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:38,020
This is the view!

1806
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:40,020
This right here is the view!

1807
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:43,020
Then you can still kinda see it.

1808
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:47,020
Right, I'm gonna very quickly make a cup of tea,

1809
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:49,020
and get some food.

1810
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:52,020
I'll be a four whole minute.

1811
02:09:52,020 --> 02:09:54,020
Hey, please do get a snack.

1812
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:55,020
Please do get a...

1813
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:58,020
Get a what?

1814
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:01,020
Get a drink and a snack and a stretch.

1815
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:05,020
I'll try and wake myself up.

1816
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:06,020
I do apologise.

1817
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:08,020
It's on my sleepy bambino,

1818
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:10,020
but I had terrible sleep last night.

1819
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:16,020
Yeah, it turns out I'm trying to like do a few things at once.

1820
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:19,020
From Zoom 12 I restreams might not be that viable.

1821
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:23,020
But who am I to say no to a cheeky stream?

1822
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:24,020
Let's be honest.

1823
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:25,020
Who am I to say no?

1824
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:28,020
Right, I'll be back in four minutes, okay?

1825
02:10:28,020 --> 02:10:31,020
Give me four minutes.

1826
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:32,020
Okay?

1827
02:10:49,020 --> 02:10:51,020
Okay.

1828
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:20,020
Okay.

1829
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:51,020
Okay.

1830
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:20,020
Okay.

1831
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:51,020
Okay.

1832
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:20,020
Okay.

1833
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:55,020
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1834
02:14:09,020 --> 02:14:11,020
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1835
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:27,020
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1836
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:30,020
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1837
02:14:30,020 --> 02:14:48,020
Are you squiddin' me right now?

1838
02:14:48,020 --> 02:14:50,020
Are you squidding me right now?

1839
02:15:18,020 --> 02:15:20,020
Are you squidding me right now?

1840
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:30,020
Are you squidding me right now?

1841
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:40,020
Are you squidding me right now?

1842
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:50,020
Are you squidding me right now?

1843
02:16:18,020 --> 02:16:20,020
Are you squidding me right now?

1844
02:16:48,020 --> 02:16:50,020
Are you squidding me right now?

1845
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:14,020
I have so much food to serve and really greedy got this.

1846
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:22,020
Oh, why are you giving me money? Stop giving me money when I go and, like, friggin' pee and stuff.

1847
02:17:22,020 --> 02:17:34,020
Thank you, Zarian, I poor. 10 and... 10 and... 10 and... Why do you have a T in the middle of your name?

1848
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:44,020
10... A... 10... To one... Carbonae... Unwilled... Stage 45... Sassafras...

1849
02:17:44,020 --> 02:17:51,020
Not Alessandro... Misacabes in chairs. Stop giving me fucking money for doing that and...

1850
02:17:51,020 --> 02:17:56,520
At least let it be an exchange of, like, you get I get, you know? I like that.

1851
02:17:56,520 --> 02:18:01,020
Right, my refund's good to go. Where the heck is the other refund? Is he hiding in his...

1852
02:18:01,020 --> 02:18:04,700
Hey, are you are you the other refund is he hiding it as an item? I

1853
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:09,640
Knew you were freaking hiding as an item. I knew it

1854
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:14,720
You're so silly. You're so predictable a lot of people and we're on the same wavelength

1855
02:18:16,220 --> 02:18:18,220
right um, I

1856
02:18:18,860 --> 02:18:26,220
Don't know how we on earth we defeat that guard. Do we just keep trying at the guard or?

1857
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,500
What's the story about him

1858
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:35,020
Oh my god, they drop Smith it you can literally farm smithing stones. Oh

1859
02:18:37,260 --> 02:18:39,900
I mean, I guess that makes sense why they introduced a new

1860
02:18:42,220 --> 02:18:45,860
Like smithing mechanic in this DLC area because you guys told me it's

1861
02:18:51,860 --> 02:18:55,700
Never learn it's because it's freaking out the piano

1862
02:18:55,700 --> 02:19:01,860
If you want to hear it in Scott because you're super chatted

1863
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:06,940
It's pen in in scots. Yes pronounced pen in

1864
02:19:08,180 --> 02:19:13,240
All right, what's going on? We're not going up to him right fuck on me. We're going around here. Oh

1865
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:16,740
Okay

1866
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:20,380
Are we rethink predictable or my program do that? Well?

1867
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:27,240
What programming you don't remember any programming because I made sure you wouldn't remember any programming

1868
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:37,860
Oh, this guy has like no poise whatever

1869
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:44,700
He cannot take this absolute thrashing wait, why am I thinking so much damage?

1870
02:19:45,220 --> 02:19:48,900
Are these not easy enemies am I gonna I'm not I'm losing it

1871
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:51,700
I'm genuinely

1872
02:19:53,700 --> 02:20:00,620
Oh, he dropped bolts, I guess you can farm them for bolts if you ever needed them right now. We're going for the night. Oh

1873
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:11,700
No, no, this can't be right. He's one hit. So how the fuck do we do this?

1874
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:21,020
I

1875
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:33,340
Does one hit leaves doesn't explain that friendly fire

1876
02:20:36,660 --> 02:20:40,020
Fuck he like wallops me when I'm trying to get a lick in

1877
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:45,740
Okay, we're okay. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. We can do it

1878
02:20:46,700 --> 02:20:49,540
Right he doesn't have poise against a great sword that's good

1879
02:20:50,420 --> 02:20:52,420
We things are just sleeper agent

1880
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:55,780
What's that black rock head

1881
02:20:56,940 --> 02:20:58,940
We shouldn't jump

1882
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:04,580
But then again, oh you need intelligence to hold a sword. Yeah, I don't think so

1883
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:14,260
Maybe not hold on maybe not hold on there's some fighting going on out here. We need help

1884
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:17,740
Okay, I helped I helped the fight

1885
02:21:19,340 --> 02:21:21,340
Wow, I love

1886
02:21:22,780 --> 02:21:27,140
Here, oh, there's an enemy in here. That's what's in here

1887
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:31,180
And then there's a blue read

1888
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:40,180
Sorry, I'm getting so distracted. There's just so many kill things around here

1889
02:21:40,740 --> 02:21:46,440
With low intelligence you hold the sharp end of the sword and get hurt literally, I'm like, oh, I'm not smart enough to hold the sword

1890
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:56,260
Oh up there up there, I don't have long range. Well, I do I tell you why but

1891
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:58,540
open open

1892
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:00,220
human

1893
02:22:00,220 --> 02:22:06,380
I'm not gonna stop until that catches on you. You understand. But can you open it any slower? Holy crap like

1894
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:08,980

02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:12,060
And I am gonna have to pause to eat

1896
02:22:12,780 --> 02:22:14,620

make grow avid I make grow avid

1899
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:23,900
Do you remember that sexy milk that used to make food on the TV show and

1900
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:26,860
She called it a micro wavy

1901
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:31,780
Can I will I watch you guys attack with the t-jump down?

1902
02:22:31,900 --> 02:22:36,220
No, he comes this way, right? I'll deal with them then

1903
02:22:38,540 --> 02:22:40,660
Take that you have terrible poise

1904
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:47,460
Wait, wait, wait, I'm refling. No. Oh my god. I need assassins creed up in this bitch. Oh

1907
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:00,260
Okay, okay

1908
02:23:02,620 --> 02:23:07,860
Oh my god, they're dropping somber smithing stones. What the heck?

1909
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:12,100
My god

1910
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:18,700
Nigella Lawson. Aye, that's it. Aye. She's like I big big me crew heavy Paula Dean

1911
02:23:18,700 --> 02:23:20,980
No, Paula Dean's a stick of butter because she was

1912
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:25,780
Because she wants to get her husband the heart attack

1913
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:27,780
There's it now

1914
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:30,540
The rat who ratchel ray

1915
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:39,460
Is there a new oh, there's an item in here. Oh my god. Yeah, my kfc before gets hold. Whoa and be used sword. Oh

1916
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:43,200
Refling it kind of looks like a bit of a boss, but

1917
02:23:45,620 --> 02:23:49,020
Um, um, um, um

1918
02:23:50,300 --> 02:23:54,380
Okay, he has shit poise that's what I like to hear shit boys shit boys shit boys

1919
02:23:55,780 --> 02:23:57,780
Get stunned get stunned get stunned

1920
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:01,980
Okay gang banged by the rickling. Ah

1921
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:08,420
That's right. Take it take it take it all that armor and you can't you can't we can't stop

1922
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:11,700
All that armor and for what?

1923
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:16,220
No, right at the next save station. I'm gonna eat my nom nom's, okay?

1924
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:19,500
And then I'll get another

1925
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:23,700
My poise breaking is actually so good. That's like retro rock

1926
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:31,380
I did how do you even make the sound of like half the Pokemon there? These sound absolutely ridiculous. Oh

1927
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:35,740
Reflame I can get you in again

1928
02:24:36,460 --> 02:24:40,780
Oh, I'm we fling. There you are my little adorable. Hold on. Let me claim the grace

1929
02:24:42,060 --> 02:24:50,700
Reflame I got me. I'm starting to think hardly anyone is in this area, which is a shame, but it's okay

1930
02:24:51,580 --> 02:24:53,580
Oh

1931
02:24:55,220 --> 02:25:01,060
Okay, and then I claim the grace and then I'm gonna inhale my McDonald's super fast at McDonald's

1932
02:25:03,500 --> 02:25:09,020
Not McDonald's I actually can't I can have breakfast McDonald's it doesn't make me go

1933
02:25:10,180 --> 02:25:12,180
But I can't the main menu

1934
02:25:13,300 --> 02:25:15,300
Breakfast it not breakfast

1935
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:23,780
Okay, I'm gonna heal myself as chicken as the as spacey chicken from KFC and then a zinger burger

1936
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:32,260
This will give me the energy to stream

1937
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:39,740
I've got I like this spacey zinger burger in the spacey be chicken baits

1938
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:42,740
I

1939
02:25:44,420 --> 02:25:50,460
Will sometimes they give you a really pitiful size bite and you're like, bro

1940
02:25:54,980 --> 02:26:01,260
My saying doesn't seem to show up. Are you got multiple your reef link and your own PC at reef? Sorry and your own PC

1941
02:26:01,460 --> 02:26:03,460
I

1942
02:26:07,740 --> 02:26:09,740
Will give you a pitiful size

1943
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:15,140
Oh, I don't think they like that

1944
02:26:20,180 --> 02:26:22,180
Yep

1945
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:29,500
Oh my god, have you ever had apple coleslaw the homemade apple coleslaw is so good

1946
02:26:31,780 --> 02:26:33,780
I

1947
02:26:35,580 --> 02:26:41,580
Mean as fast as cat it'll be a lot faster than the naturals I had yesterday. I promise actually I've only got a few bites

1948
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:47,820
And the naturals are so messy

1949
02:27:01,260 --> 02:27:03,260
Oh

1950
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:11,820
Person size should make you fat or sad

1951
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:17,540
I don't know why

1952
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:19,980
But fried chicken absolutely made them

1953
02:27:20,820 --> 02:27:27,660
Like American fried chicken though. I cannot wait to try it. I don't know. I like I watch a lot of food videos

1954
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:34,220
And there's something about American fried chicken that just looks crazy. Did you say apple coleslaw? Yes, I'm not kidding

1955
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:36,220
It's so nice and sweet

1956
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:41,660
He's got meal and for friends

1957
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:47,500
We have another 18 hours this time

1958
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:49,500
I

1959
02:27:56,780 --> 02:28:02,380
Surprisingly the burger lasted I don't know how they do it, but

1960
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:11,740
This is another conspiracy non-conspiracy, I don't really actually mind and I'm like convinced they somehow figured out that heating up

1961
02:28:11,740 --> 02:28:16,140
Take away makes it taste worse, but having a fresh makes it better

1962
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:25,020
Your mouth animation. Yeah, like if my jaw goes down too much because I'm chewing my jaw goes down

1963
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:28,540
So when I eat my mouth is closed, but my model's like

1964
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:38,300
A little big paper

1965
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:43,700
First food taste better. No say it's not real. I can't be true

1966
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:50,500
No way, I know

1967
02:28:52,540 --> 02:28:58,180
But why can't it why can't it taste as good?

1968
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:03,300
Hmm

1969
02:29:03,300 --> 02:29:05,300
That's a good point

1970
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:08,180
So food can marinate and taste better the next day

1971
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:14,340
One of the biggest examples is like just your average spaghetti dish or like a pasta dish

1972
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:18,540
The next day because the flavor like infuses better with the pasta

1973
02:29:27,540 --> 02:29:29,020
Oh

1974
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:35,180
No, you can tell when I stuff my mouth too big because I go like the model makes the face

1975
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:40,420
Instead it's just the regular

1976
02:29:40,780 --> 02:29:43,140
Okay, I'm halfway through the burger. I'm almost done

1977
02:29:44,340 --> 02:29:46,340
Oh

1978
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:52,380
My teeth are so full

1979
02:29:55,940 --> 02:30:01,660
Thank you to friends on how the degradation of works in the chemical reactions of the food in the boss

1980
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:11,460
Spaghetti always tastes better the next day

1981
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:17,340
I

1982
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:27,740
This is the thing with tomato dishes deep in the flavor look guys get it all sharing our not wait

1983
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:33,060
Why are we lying out on the table? What's going on here? Is this the dungeon? Are we in a dungeon right now?

1984
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:36,780
That kind of dungeon

1985
02:30:40,780 --> 02:30:42,780
Cute hamster women

1986
02:30:45,340 --> 02:30:50,820
Want to see how much I can fit in my mouth want to see it again

1987
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:07,700
And our behind-the-scenes question

1988
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:12,060
But does watching a ball at times to impact the watch that?

1989
02:31:12,060 --> 02:31:14,060
I'm

1990
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:16,300
negligible

1991
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:18,500
negligible so

1992
02:31:18,500 --> 02:31:22,300
The YouTube if it's a two-hour bot and you watch it on times two

1993
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:28,740
YouTube will give you will give me one hour of watch time for that even though you consumed at all

1994
02:31:30,820 --> 02:31:37,340
But it's better that you did that right then not watching it at all like it doesn't make a difference in terms of thing

1995
02:31:37,340 --> 02:31:43,940
The only thing it would make a difference in is ASMR content for some reason the way the ads work on ASMR content

1996
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:50,580
And how it gets recommended I was a bit different. I don't know why I'm gone

1997
02:31:52,540 --> 02:32:00,500
The longer someone watches an ASMR video from start to finish the more it's gonna get recommended because YouTube go

1998
02:32:00,500 --> 02:32:02,820
Oh people watch this from start to end good

1999
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:05,260
I

2000
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:13,820
Hamster girl for gender. No, I have recent agency came out where we hamster

2001
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:34,820
I

2002
02:32:49,060 --> 02:32:51,540
Watching ASMR in times to speed would be weird

2003
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:01,060
That's basically what times two is more

2004
02:33:03,620 --> 02:33:05,620
I get any further known

2005
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:11,900
Get to know fad for this

2006
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:18,100
All meat slime ASMR times to brah that would go for a while

2007
02:33:21,820 --> 02:33:24,820
Gentoo these girls we are strong accent to

2008
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:28,740
And

2009
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:30,740
No

2010
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:38,020
This is where things get a bit interesting because accent are in a major appeal

2011
02:33:38,700 --> 02:33:42,620
Are I wait once one more bite my burger and I finished it

2012
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:01,500
I

2013
02:34:04,940 --> 02:34:06,940
Reef on doing out there

2014
02:34:08,780 --> 02:34:15,220
Wow, okay on the topic of accents and feature birds. Yes

2015
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:21,700
It's very good at any moment. You can differentiate any girl

2016
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:25,220
There's a slight

2017
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:31,560
You may argue although this is completely my opinion, but

2018
02:34:32,900 --> 02:34:39,140
Who goes there identify yourself? I said identify yourself by the Pope and

2019
02:34:40,140 --> 02:34:47,860
There is possibly an American accent debuff in terms of if they cannot be distinguished

2020
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:50,660
now

2021
02:34:50,660 --> 02:34:56,320
Obviously Azura and she be sound completely different. They have two very distinguishable voices

2022
02:34:58,980 --> 02:35:00,660
But would

2023
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:07,540
Would I want to fill Gen 2 with all Americans? I would be cautious. I would be cautious. I

2024
02:35:08,340 --> 02:35:10,340
Want a Filipino I

2025
02:35:11,140 --> 02:35:14,640
Want an English or Welsh possibly? I

2026
02:35:15,240 --> 02:35:17,240
Want

2027
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:19,640
I want

2028
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:21,680
Satin of other in Europe

2029
02:35:23,360 --> 02:35:25,360
Possibly Japanese-speaking I

2030
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:30,240
Want but the variety it did did it just burp you unconsciously okay

2031
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:36,000
But just because I want does it mean I'm gonna get and please do not if you're lurking in the shadow

2032
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:42,600
Please do not think as anyone you cuz I've just said that that's not how it works. I am just saying that I

2033
02:35:43,480 --> 02:35:45,480
Think accent differentiation

2034
02:35:46,840 --> 02:35:48,840
specifically in I

2035
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:56,600
Guess a vtuber company corporation where we want to call it it's very important

2036
02:35:57,800 --> 02:35:59,800
Because if someone goes

2037
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:04,640
If someone goes all that talent sounds like that talent you're up Shite Creek

2038
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:07,600
That's not good

2039
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:10,280
And

2040
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:16,560
Good morning. Good afternoon or good evening. Oh, it's good morning. Good evening, and then good afternoon in the mess

2041
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:21,480
If Jento doesn't have a southern belt like mama, I will

2042
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,440
Maybe travel playground

2043
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:30,480
Oh, that's when you put pranks down I was like what the frick is that word again?

2044
02:36:32,480 --> 02:36:34,480
What European accent in particular

2045
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:36,760
I

2046
02:36:36,760 --> 02:36:44,160
Honestly couldn't be a rat or what country maybe an Espanol maybe a Latina

2047
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:49,240
Or a Mexico I wouldn't mind that on the team

2048
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:56,000
But if I'm gonna get it who knows it doesn't know fucking

2049
02:36:56,440 --> 02:37:00,520
Relax already people like fucking throwing shite just because I'm saying my

Luxenese you guys speak Luxenese over there

2071
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:30,320

2072
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:36,000

2073
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:40,080
the content that we make I

2074
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:47,560
Don't think it's appropriate for anyone raised in those kind of country can't wait for the German beach of Rome

2075
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:50,240
Hello lights

2076

Yeah, that's what our German feature is gonna sound like right. Okay edge to the gently edge

2079
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:14,440
The one German absolutely just gobsmacked at the what I've just said. I just said your mother is a pig. I think

2080
02:39:15,440 --> 02:39:19,600
That's hot. That's what you want. You want a German? I mean, I'll take a German

2081
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:24,880
I do like a German accent. I've done a German accent on English-speaking German accent

2082
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:30,600
Accent should it shouldn't be overlooked. Whoa. I was a big star there should not be overlooked

2083
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:34,120
I was gonna say can't be overlooked shouldn't be overlooked. Wait. Have we gone the wrong way?

2084
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:39,080
Whoopsies. We've gone the wrong way. Look on it. Oh, we'll put the torch away. We're not sure where we're going

2085
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:44,440
Now the torch is away. I repeat the torch is away. We do not know where we're going

2086
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:47,760
So if we don't know where we're going, we might as well go on an adventure

2087
02:39:48,400 --> 02:39:51,720
This will be the furthest step I've ever taken from Lynn Graves

2088
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:54,680
Oh

2089
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:57,160
Reece Lynn

2090
02:39:58,120 --> 02:40:05,120
Is it really okay? He's got a torch again. We've got our head and boys. We've got our Baron gently gently

2091
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:15,880
Wait, why did you roll? Why did you roll that? I don't know. There are enemies here. Wait, have we been here before?

2092
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:21,320
I don't know the German. I don't listen to talk like that, but mommy. I can't like alright

2093
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:23,640
Do you want me to do an actual nice German accent?

2094
02:40:24,680 --> 02:40:30,640
Fine. Are you block me? Wait, don't go this way. Oh, it's this is oh my god

They literally saved me. I am not kidding. You guys literally just saved me

2096
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:37,600
I would have walked straight down into that

2097
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:42,640
Unironically got saved by the reeflings from blocking me to imminent death

2098
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:51,040
Okay, and an actual German accent. I would like a cute light voice German. I'd stick you on a lollipop

2099
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:53,040
Oh

2100
02:41:00,080 --> 02:41:07,120
Where the fuck did you guys go? Oh, you went up the stairs like a cute lollipop German. I'm sorry. I kneel

2101
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:11,680
Oh, no, this can be

2102
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:18,880
Um, okay, this isn't okay. Good luck. Kiss. Mwah. Mwah. Mwah. I think you get sent back to your world. Okay. Okay. Okay

2103
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:22,800
I'm not got the crossbow out. We're gonna see what the damage is behind here

2104
02:41:24,880 --> 02:41:27,440
Magic, okay, I can handle it. They're coming for me

2105
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:32,640
I was a bit early, but that was actually very nice timing

2106
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:37,360
What kind of are you trying to give me an enchantment? You are I saw that I caught it

2107
02:41:39,360 --> 02:41:43,200
Uh terrible news the poise is high. I repeat the poise is high

2108
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:48,400
Okay

2109
02:41:48,560 --> 02:41:54,000
Wait, whoa, whoa, your blessing just caused me to lose like 10 health and no more

2110
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:57,840
I miss right. Hold on. Let me get my stamina back

2111
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:03,520
Curious what a lovely bomb. Oh, I miss sorry

2112
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:07,440

2114
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:16,560
Target these nuts

2115
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:20,480
I like how we all just slammer unanimously. Whoa

2116
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:26,720
Ah stop it. You you she's so much poise

2117
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:31,520
Unbreakable unbreakable. That's not what I like in a woman

2118
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:35,440
Oh

2119
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:40,160
Hold on

2120
02:42:40,160 --> 02:42:46,080
I'm a pop my flask. I don't know what it does. I'm a pop it. Oh, it's empty. Of course. I've already popped it. Why wouldn't I?

2121
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:49,360
What's this?

2122
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:57,440
I didn't even know what my ultimate was there. Oh my god, my cup of tea's getting cold. Oh

2123
02:42:58,480 --> 02:43:01,520
Should I just crossbow for reason? I feel like she wouldn't have much

2124
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:09,040
Hold on Reesland you guys hold on. I'm a swap to I'm a I'm a swap to my crossbow ball

Let's go. Mommy's got aim bot. Let's do please damage

2129
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:29,200
Yeah, let's take some aggro after we

2130
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:34,160
I was very delayed on that response. I'm not going to tend otherwise

2131
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:43,040
Okay, we got an ult. We got an ult. We got an ult. We got an ult. We got an ult. Uh, sorry, uh special attack

2132
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:47,600
Oh, I'm getting my my bubble again my bubble

2133
02:43:50,880 --> 02:43:53,200
Mine's not even four times that

2134
02:43:54,160 --> 02:44:00,160
Oh, that's just rude mine's not my willy's not big like that honestly. That was that was just

2135
02:44:01,120 --> 02:44:04,160
That was hyper that's that category is hyper

2136
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:07,440
Stop moving

2137
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:18,080
As if it changed to me at the last second I saw that pointing at that refill and I was like, oh, I'm not gonna dodge because it's just pointing at that

2138
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:20,160
Wait, stop moving

2139
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:22,400
Right there

2140
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:29,680
Okay

2141
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:36,080
Did I do bleed damage yet? I don't know if I should try and do poison fire

2142
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:45,920
Okay, that's in the wrong one. So that's fire. Okay fire. Why would you be resistant to fire? I'm not really sure

2143
02:44:50,480 --> 02:44:56,320
I'm okay. It's fine. I have a lovely cup of tea to enjoy after this very successful thing

2144
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:02,800
I'm I promise I'm hitting all my shots when you see her on fire. That's me hitting my shots when you don't see her on fire

2145
02:45:02,800 --> 02:45:04,800
That's me fucking up all my shots

2146
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:07,760
Is it is she doing bleed damage?

2147
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:14,400
What is that? Uh, I guess she's not fire resistant. Why the fuck it?

2148
02:45:16,720 --> 02:45:22,000
Okay, we're going for scarlet rock because she clearly knows what she's doing with the

2149
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:25,520
A magic knight

2150
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:27,760
Wait

2151
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:29,760
Get right. Oh, what the heck hold on

2152
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:34,720
You're doing great sweetie. Keep it up. You're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing fantastic

2153
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:44,400
I only have one incantation left

2154
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:48,240
I only have one incantation left

2155
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:51,840
I've done all I can

2156
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:55,200
Oh, no, we're actually gonna have to try and fight. I can't believe it

2157
02:45:56,640 --> 02:45:58,640
I know it's terrible

2158
02:45:58,800 --> 02:46:00,800
We're actually gonna have to try and play again

2159
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:04,800
Do you mean you can't just carry me through one grave and I love the good thing?

2160
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:25,920
How does that keep being one HB

2161
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:30,640
That was phase two

2162
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:36,560
You'll like to wait for a second and a refund perishes. Literally refunds. They're like witness me

2163
02:46:37,440 --> 02:46:39,920
All right, let me make sure I've got decent bows on

This piece of paper is going to be filled up so much. I cannot wait to post it when we finish this

2169
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:09,280
Right mage. You've actually not wait. No, this is a boss fight. So it doesn't count

2170
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:14,800
It doesn't count if it's a boss because we might be perishing over and over again

2171
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:17,280

2180
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:49,680
And and either everyone can confirm if they're there or not

2181
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:54,240
No, hello, hello America. Hello

2182
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:59,840
You want to lie down on the table here for no particular reason at all

2183
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:06,080
No, I thought Vigo was in the room it was here

This is the biggest luffa bread humanity will ever win honestly

2227
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:28,640
a wee bit

2228
02:51:31,360 --> 02:51:33,360

Hold on I'm helping. I'm helping. Okay, I did drop some

2231
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:54,640
See those things you never tell who they're gonna go to like until last

2232
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:07,040

I can't get over how much damage. Oh my god, I'm starting to understand why folks quit the game

Absolute nightmare. I'm still perishing in faith

2239
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:42,400
I wonder if I really should maybe do magic and I could do magic from afar instead of the crossbow balls

2321
02:59:34,240 --> 02:59:36,240
Okay, we're back

2497
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:36,000
A fruit juice and it was like basically I mean in theory it should reset me

2498
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:41,040

03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:45,120

Unfortunately, I can't really do like the editing

Enemy again

2545
03:22:17,360 --> 03:22:22,000
I mean if she's stuck in this corner, I might actually be able to get some bleed damage wax in

2546
03:22:22,080 --> 03:22:27,200
I think I just saw a bleed damage go off there. Oh, hold on. Hold on. That's for me

2547

See if I can take the aggro like that so the the two reflings can just straight up go behind her and

2554
03:23:03,920 --> 03:23:05,920
Do the rest of the attack

2555

It just requires good timing. So do you looks promising someone says because of the design?

I'm trying to take aggro so you guys can breathe. I'm trying to take aggro. It's not really working

2650
03:30:08,880 --> 03:30:14,480
My taunts on cooldown my taunts on cooldown for aggro dps slow down dps slow down

2651
03:30:15,600 --> 03:30:17,600
You're taking aggro

2652
03:30:19,680 --> 03:30:21,680
Okay

2653
03:30:22,240 --> 03:30:30,560
Jump jump jump jump jump. Oh, fuck. I was too late. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no link this

2654
03:30:30,800 --> 03:30:32,800
Not like this

2655
03:30:34,640 --> 03:30:40,160
Not like this. No, you guys did fantastic

2656
03:30:43,120 --> 03:30:45,620
Oh, you did fantastic

2657
03:30:48,640 --> 03:30:53,200
I didn't know when it was gonna drop. I thought I could react in time for the drop

2658
03:30:53,280 --> 03:30:56,560
But as soon as I see it, I'm just gonna start doing jumping jacks. Okay

2659
03:30:57,520 --> 03:31:00,480
Oh, that was a fantastic attempt

2660
03:31:03,120 --> 03:31:08,000
Rishan, were you not just in that? How do you think you're signed down? About time, right? You too had your sign down

2661
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:10,960
Major Evelyn can't get a shot

2662
03:31:13,520 --> 03:31:15,520
Oh, that was such a fantastic

2663
03:31:16,160 --> 03:31:20,400
Go that was so good. I know you guys can do it like because we got down to there

2664
03:31:20,720 --> 03:31:22,000
I know

2665
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:24,640
For a fact you guys can do it. Phoenix, have you had a shot?

2666
03:31:25,600 --> 03:31:27,600
I don't think so

2667
03:31:28,320 --> 03:31:30,320
Jess, did you get a shot?

2668
03:31:31,520 --> 03:31:33,520
I don't think Phoenix had a shot

2669
03:31:33,760 --> 03:31:35,760
Let's try it

2670
03:31:37,040 --> 03:31:42,480
I'm so sorry if you have had a shot and I'm like doing it wrong. I cannot tell you her unbelievably scribbly

2671
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:45,280
Where where is the summoning pool?

2672
03:31:46,000 --> 03:31:48,960
It's not a summoning pool. It's it's this

2673
03:31:49,600 --> 03:31:51,600
This is where I pick you up from

2674
03:31:52,320 --> 03:31:54,080
The rest site

2675
03:31:54,080 --> 03:31:57,840
You put down your marker on the rest site at castle lords chamber

2676
03:31:58,400 --> 03:32:00,560
And then multiplayer password is reef

2677
03:32:01,120 --> 03:32:05,920
And then I can see your summoning sign because we share the same multiplayer thing

2678
03:32:12,480 --> 03:32:16,880
There is none we rate it at the grace yet the mark of grace

2679
03:32:18,160 --> 03:32:20,960
As long as you're on pc and you have the dlc

2680
03:32:22,160 --> 03:32:24,560
It cast the lords chambers the enemy

2681
03:32:26,880 --> 03:32:28,880
Okay, uh, do you want kisses?

2682
03:32:29,280 --> 03:32:36,160
What kind of oh you no way you both perfectly. Oh, I thought you both perfectly amoted to sit down together. That's funny

2683
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:40,000
Are you sitting down?

2684
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:41,760
Oh, yeah

2685
03:32:41,760 --> 03:32:44,640
Oh, yeah, okay. Let's see. Oh, you just want to fit

2686
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:48,000
Okay, you have to be blessed

2687
03:32:48,080 --> 03:32:54,720
To war we go my reef flings. We still have this so I refuse to leave. I know we have this I refuse I refuse

2688
03:32:56,400 --> 03:32:59,440
But I'm stealing me moves not to drink but down straight

2689
03:33:00,400 --> 03:33:03,840
Okay, you ready? Okay, no one needs a blessing. We're not blessing

2690
03:33:05,280 --> 03:33:07,280
Hey, oh, that's nice. That's nice

2691
03:33:11,360 --> 03:33:16,800
One two third strike, which is delayed, but that's only in phase one

2692
03:33:17,040 --> 03:33:20,640
Wait, where the fuck are my arrows? Oh, sorry. I suck

2693
03:33:22,000 --> 03:33:23,680
Oh, no

2694
03:33:23,680 --> 03:33:25,680
Oh, no, hold on

2695
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:30,400
Uh, I am burning through these like nothing on air. Oh crap

2696
03:33:34,080 --> 03:33:40,160
That's my fire. That's my fire. Don't worry. That's my fire. It's me me doing it

2697
03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:43,520
Hold on. I'm trying not to get us too close

2698
03:33:43,600 --> 03:33:48,480
Like I'm trying to give an angle that's opposite of her coming like if she becomes aggro

2699
03:33:48,480 --> 03:33:55,360
I want her to back away from the reef flings to give them breathing space to heal or to swallow a potion or something

2700
03:33:57,200 --> 03:34:01,680
But she is not having it. I actually can't I'm covering up her attacks. I think

2701
03:34:02,320 --> 03:34:05,600
I think I'm stopping you guys from being able to see her

2702
03:34:06,160 --> 03:34:08,160
Big swing one swing and then a swish

2703
03:34:09,040 --> 03:34:11,040
Oh, and I jumped right into

2704
03:34:11,760 --> 03:34:14,800
Of course, I jumped right into it. That'd be too easy

2705
03:34:18,640 --> 03:34:22,240
I'm wondering should I swap to the other crossbow ball? I feel like I'm like

2706
03:34:23,920 --> 03:34:27,680
I feel like I'm missing so many I need to be this close to her to do it

2707
03:34:30,320 --> 03:34:36,960
Okay, that was funny as fuck. Okay phase two phase two jump when you see the snow blue

2708
03:34:37,680 --> 03:34:39,680
Oh

2709
03:34:40,080 --> 03:34:42,080
No reef laying

2710
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:47,680
Wait, am I empty? Oh my god. I'm empty. Oh my god. I'm empty. Hold on

2711
03:34:49,360 --> 03:34:51,360
Oh my god, I'm empty

2712
03:34:52,320 --> 03:34:54,880
I'm freaking burning through everything so quickly

2713
03:34:56,720 --> 03:34:58,720
I'm trying I'm trying I really am

2714
03:35:00,720 --> 03:35:02,720
Oh god, no

2715
03:35:07,760 --> 03:35:09,760
Okay, she's not in her

2716
03:35:12,160 --> 03:35:14,160
Fuck

2717
03:35:19,760 --> 03:35:22,160
Hold on give me aggro

2718
03:35:30,080 --> 03:35:32,080
Fuck you

2719
03:35:37,680 --> 03:35:41,680
Jump fuck fuck fuck

2720
03:35:45,280 --> 03:35:50,960
No, my baby reef link didn't make it. No my poor baby

2721
03:35:53,360 --> 03:35:57,520
Okay, I'm just gonna let her kill me. I don't want to do it without my reef links

2722
03:35:57,920 --> 03:36:01,760
But we did successfully avoid the ace globes for once

2723
03:36:02,400 --> 03:36:06,000
I thought I did it way too early, but I guess just jump and go for it

2724
03:36:07,440 --> 03:36:13,040
Oh my god, we are so gonna do it. I'm sorry. We're like getting so close

2725
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:26,640
We're so close we're getting so close but no more arrows

2726
03:36:29,440 --> 03:36:35,040
Good try. Yeah, listen to the jump smile has everyone who's here had one attempt

2727
03:36:35,680 --> 03:36:37,680
I don't even see

2728
03:36:38,240 --> 03:36:40,240
What are you saying?

2729
03:36:41,120 --> 03:36:46,160
I don't know. I'm just gonna call you say I don't think says had a shot. How are we looking over here?

2730
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:50,320
I don't think you've had a shot of this one

2731
03:36:53,840 --> 03:36:57,680
I mean, I don't think in general what face and what a name

2732
03:36:59,760 --> 03:37:02,080
I'm wondering I don't want to go to heavy

2733
03:37:02,800 --> 03:37:04,320
Without

2734
03:37:04,320 --> 03:37:06,960
Wait, how is that better for me than what I'm wearing?

2735
03:37:07,840 --> 03:37:09,840
what

2736
03:37:09,920 --> 03:37:12,420
Am I wearing like absolutely terrible ropes?

2737
03:37:18,800 --> 03:37:23,360
I'll oh it's turning my poise down. Wait, that puts my poise up

2738
03:37:28,800 --> 03:37:30,800
But my immunity goes down

2739
03:37:32,800 --> 03:37:40,240
Wait, hold on. I don't know how clothes work in this game. Okay, that's the best gloves over the best trousers I can have

2740
03:37:41,680 --> 03:37:44,080
I'm still a medium loads putting these on

2741
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:48,960
Point up but look at the weight. Yeah

2742
03:37:52,560 --> 03:37:56,640
What was the negative thing this beast head did? I can't remember I can't recall

2743
03:37:58,400 --> 03:38:01,120
I mean everything I have is better than that

2744
03:38:01,680 --> 03:38:05,360
It's sorry the beast head is the best but I can still I'm still medium and stuff

2745
03:38:07,440 --> 03:38:09,840
Yeah, I've got you posing

2746
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:14,580
That's what my whole looks like after the convention

2747
03:38:19,360 --> 03:38:22,080
Freel quick. Oh you you have items for me

2748
03:38:22,960 --> 03:38:24,160
Oh

2749
03:38:24,160 --> 03:38:30,820
Okay, I'll use my other crossbow this time. Are you ready? Three two one

2750
03:38:31,280 --> 03:38:33,280
Yeah

2751
03:38:33,600 --> 03:38:36,640
All right, let's see about using these more

2752
03:38:38,080 --> 03:38:40,080
Uh crazier

2753
03:38:40,640 --> 03:38:42,640
Ballista, let's try a ballista

2754
03:38:44,720 --> 03:38:48,240
I have 99 bird causes

2755
03:38:49,200 --> 03:38:51,200
Bird fair bar

2756
03:38:51,920 --> 03:38:55,920
Okay, that causes a loss of blood. Oh wait, is it this one I want to do with it?

2757
03:38:57,360 --> 03:38:59,360
Uh

2758
03:39:01,920 --> 03:39:03,920
Huh

2759
03:39:06,160 --> 03:39:12,400
I mean I'll try it. Well, give her a light one. Give her a bone. You're my bone

2760
03:39:14,080 --> 03:39:17,040
I already did it. Yeah, goober. I'll already uh

2761
03:39:18,960 --> 03:39:23,760
You can get kissing sit and you kiss it. Are you ready?

2762
03:39:23,840 --> 03:39:31,440
Uh the ballista needs great bolts. Okay. I have great bolts one surely surely. That's why I just go on. Yeah

2763
03:39:32,880 --> 03:39:34,880
Are they both these great bolts?

2764
03:39:36,240 --> 03:39:40,320
Why do video games give you items that are scarce if you never want to use them?

2765
03:39:41,760 --> 03:39:43,760
Because they are so scarce

2766
03:39:44,160 --> 03:39:46,160
Oh

2767
03:39:51,600 --> 03:39:57,600
I missed aha take that I missed. Hold on. Let me grab my tools

2768
03:40:02,480 --> 03:40:04,480
Uh

2769
03:40:05,440 --> 03:40:09,440
Okay, I am very tempted to go back to me crossbow

2770
03:40:10,160 --> 03:40:13,280
Okay, there we go. Did they even do any damage?

2771
03:40:14,720 --> 03:40:16,720
I don't even think they did anything

2772
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:20,720
This is doing nothing

2773
03:40:22,480 --> 03:40:24,480
Am I going mental?

2774
03:40:25,600 --> 03:40:28,080
Hold on. Well, let me try to look at the HP bar

2775
03:40:30,240 --> 03:40:32,240
That's 400 it does

2776
03:40:32,560 --> 03:40:38,800
Sorry. Yeah, I'm like losing all mobility trying to use this ballista. I'm sorry. I'm losing all my mobility

2777
03:40:39,760 --> 03:40:42,880
Hold on. Let me swap out. You're doing great sweetie. Keep it up

2778
03:40:43,760 --> 03:40:45,760
Keep going darlin

2779
03:40:45,840 --> 03:40:52,320
Um, I don't want to use the rapid fire, but I have so much more damage. I'm not going arrow. It's actual bow and arrow

2780
03:40:52,400 --> 03:40:54,400
How do I use this?

2781
03:40:55,280 --> 03:41:00,080
No, I don't have bows. Hold on. I do have bows like one of these

2782
03:41:01,520 --> 03:41:03,520
Some of these that one

2783
03:41:04,080 --> 03:41:06,160
No

2784
03:41:06,160 --> 03:41:08,160
Oh, it's fucking purple

2785
03:41:09,120 --> 03:41:18,720
It's why did it you aim for her head? Oh, come on

2786
03:41:22,960 --> 03:41:24,960
Does that even do anything?

2787
03:41:28,880 --> 03:41:30,880
Uh, I'm definitely getting off of her

2788
03:41:33,520 --> 03:41:35,520
I feel like this is just the best way to go

2789
03:41:35,520 --> 03:41:37,520
Oh

2790
03:41:37,600 --> 03:41:42,320
I'm like not I'm not wasting as much ammo as well because if I miss I'm into

2791
03:41:46,320 --> 03:41:48,320
I rolled into it

2792
03:41:49,680 --> 03:41:51,200
He rolled twice

2793
03:41:51,200 --> 03:41:56,960
Right here, and I'm like not taking any aggro right now if I'm not fucking them. Yeah, sorry. I just completely

2794
03:41:57,840 --> 03:42:01,040
I was experimenting. I didn't experiment very well

2795
03:42:06,240 --> 03:42:08,240
Okay

2796
03:42:11,200 --> 03:42:13,200
Okay

2797
03:42:16,080 --> 03:42:19,680
I was far too early on that one. I knew exactly what I did wrong

2798
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:24,000
Ah, are you dead? No, you're alive

2799
03:42:27,920 --> 03:42:29,920
How did that hit me?

2800
03:42:30,240 --> 03:42:32,240
Oh

2801
03:42:39,200 --> 03:42:41,200
I've used my wonders to beat

2802
03:42:46,320 --> 03:42:54,160
Oh, whoa, whoa, see that aggro swap is what I can't keep up with one hold on let me heal

2803
03:42:55,040 --> 03:42:57,040
Oh

2804
03:43:00,480 --> 03:43:03,040
Ah, okay, okay, okay about the souls are gotten that up

2805
03:43:07,840 --> 03:43:09,840
I think the shotgun

2806
03:43:09,840 --> 03:43:12,960
Crossbow the one that goes like it does a lot

2807
03:43:13,760 --> 03:43:15,760
Finally gets attached around you

2808
03:43:17,520 --> 03:43:19,520
Let's go

2809
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:23,120
Solid fight not bad

2810
03:43:23,600 --> 03:43:28,000
They aren't that scarce. You just can't carry a lot at once. There's a lot less than your bleed though

2811
03:43:29,040 --> 03:43:31,040
So just focus on

2812
03:43:31,600 --> 03:43:34,720
Right spray bleed. That's all I need to do spray bleed

2813
03:43:36,720 --> 03:43:38,720
I'm still very um

2814
03:43:40,480 --> 03:43:44,640
Leap, leap, leap. The replant has given me tons of bleed. Literally all the bleed

2815
03:43:46,240 --> 03:43:48,800
Oh wait, I'm using a bow aren't I not an arrow?

2816
03:43:49,920 --> 03:43:51,920
That's an arrow. I need

2817
03:43:52,480 --> 03:43:54,480
I need what barbed bolts

2818
03:43:55,120 --> 03:43:57,120
Yeah

2819
03:43:58,560 --> 03:44:02,400
Uh, I'm not poison as well. You guys have oh that one has it

2820
03:44:05,920 --> 03:44:08,560
Okay, I'll do I'll do

2821
03:44:10,320 --> 03:44:12,560
This is really cool boss. I look forward to hating

2822
03:44:13,600 --> 03:44:17,280
Facing her. Wow. Oh good. The reinforcements are here

2823
03:44:18,400 --> 03:44:20,880
Uh, you is there anyone here who hasn't had a show?

2824
03:44:22,720 --> 03:44:24,720
Barrette?

2825
03:44:26,720 --> 03:44:30,800
Barrette hasn't had a show. I don't think I can't see

2826
03:44:37,520 --> 03:44:40,720
Suru you did have a show. Phoenix he says

2827
03:44:42,560 --> 03:44:45,200
Taku? You've not had a show

2828
03:44:45,920 --> 03:44:47,920
Oh

2829
03:44:50,720 --> 03:44:52,720
We'll drop you bolts. Don't you worry. Okay

2830
03:44:54,000 --> 03:44:58,640
Not only do I get in-game currency and game this and game that I also get in-game bulk

2831
03:44:59,760 --> 03:45:01,760
Are you a dom?

2832
03:45:02,400 --> 03:45:04,800
Something domey somethings mommy

2833
03:45:05,760 --> 03:45:07,760
Look at their tables

2834
03:45:08,560 --> 03:45:12,080
I don't like that. No kings. All weaklings are easy

2835
03:45:15,280 --> 03:45:18,640
Okay, we do kisses

2836
03:45:20,080 --> 03:45:26,240
Oh, oh, that's exactly what I needed. Let's go. All right. We're ready to do the boss

2837
03:45:31,360 --> 03:45:40,000
Oh, okay, that's exactly what I needed not even telling me. Okay. Let's do it. Let's go. Do you guys need to do any spells or incantations?

2838
03:45:40,880 --> 03:45:43,200
I don't think so you guys look like melee boys

2839
03:45:43,760 --> 03:45:49,920
Okay. Oh, no. Wait. We're getting praised. I missed it. Oh, wait. Did that hit me? It hit me. I still got it

2840
03:45:59,360 --> 03:46:01,360
Is there no way to zoom in on that?

2841
03:46:04,720 --> 03:46:08,400
Well, I guess it's closer I get and the more I can spray into her

2842
03:46:08,800 --> 03:46:15,040
But the more she can also do such a thing like that

2843
03:46:30,560 --> 03:46:34,400
Right into right into I seem to always go into that sword now

2844
03:46:34,560 --> 03:46:36,560
Oh

2845
03:46:36,880 --> 03:46:38,880
This is a bit like it's scary

2846
03:46:41,280 --> 03:46:44,080
When she can just do that

2847
03:46:48,400 --> 03:46:53,680
Phase two warning phase two warning. I can't take aggro without

2848
03:46:56,160 --> 03:46:58,160
Okay, phase two warning achieved

2849
03:46:58,160 --> 03:47:00,160
I

2850
03:47:08,320 --> 03:47:10,320
I'm trying to take aggro. I'm I'm

2851
03:47:11,920 --> 03:47:15,760
Oh, shit. I'm taking too much aggro. I took too much aggro

2852
03:47:16,640 --> 03:47:19,520
I wasn't prepared for that like left off there

2853
03:47:20,240 --> 03:47:22,240
Ah

2854
03:47:25,040 --> 03:47:27,680
That's so much bleed it's working though

2855
03:47:28,560 --> 03:47:33,760
Shotgun cross will burn both so fast. I think I should just do the singular one

2856
03:47:34,960 --> 03:47:36,960
I think you're right

2857
03:47:41,840 --> 03:47:44,560
But it's doing so much like we're getting so close

2858
03:47:46,320 --> 03:47:48,320
I don't know. Let me go again

2859
03:47:49,120 --> 03:47:51,120
Let me go again. Let me go again. All right, hold on

2860
03:47:52,000 --> 03:47:54,320
Can you feel like you had a shot of this by four?

2861
03:47:55,520 --> 03:47:57,520
Now don't think you had a shot of her

2862
03:48:01,440 --> 03:48:05,440
Anyone here who hasn't had a shot about fucking time

2863
03:48:07,040 --> 03:48:09,040
Hi lords, did you get a shot of this guy?

2864
03:48:10,320 --> 03:48:12,320
I'll read your name

2865
03:48:13,280 --> 03:48:15,280
I

2866
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:20,000
Think

2867
03:48:28,640 --> 03:48:34,480
Watching you play the cross will makes me want to play a cross will build the cross will hardly does any damage at all

2868
03:48:35,360 --> 03:48:38,640
Oh, do you want to princess carry me through the game? Sure? You can

2869
03:48:43,200 --> 03:48:50,720
Yeah, the hit probability is higher which is causing the bleed if bleed does 10% full health damage

2870
03:48:51,280 --> 03:48:53,280
It just seems so worth it. You know

2871
03:48:54,080 --> 03:48:56,080
Are you guys ready?

2872
03:48:56,160 --> 03:48:58,160
up

2873
03:49:01,760 --> 03:49:03,760
Well, we get to it

2874
03:49:04,400 --> 03:49:06,400
Wait, I am convinced

2875
03:49:06,400 --> 03:49:10,320
With my reeflings anything is possible and I know for a fact we can do this

2876
03:49:12,560 --> 03:49:15,360
You're running out of bolts and landing

2877
03:49:16,320 --> 03:49:20,560
10% of them and that's 10% more damage then

2878
03:49:21,920 --> 03:49:28,560
I'm not really and then am I allowed to be cheeky and see I'm not really running out of bolts because the reeflings are giving me so many

2879
03:49:34,000 --> 03:49:36,000
Oh

2880
03:49:36,880 --> 03:49:38,880
Oh

2881
03:49:42,080 --> 03:49:45,760
My god, we're bleeding out a day. Oh big swipe

2882
03:49:48,400 --> 03:49:50,400
Actually did it for

2883
03:49:51,520 --> 03:49:56,880
Fire magic phase two look out for the ice tricking balls

2884
03:49:58,080 --> 03:50:00,080
Well, that's not me doing that hold on

2885
03:50:00,960 --> 03:50:04,400
Hold on mommy's gonna reload. Oh, you guys are doing fantastic darling

2886
03:50:05,200 --> 03:50:07,200
Oh, you're doing fantastic darling

2887
03:50:07,600 --> 03:50:11,360
Absolutely yummy delicious scrumptious darling

2888
03:50:12,320 --> 03:50:15,200
Delicious delicious delicious. Hold on

2889
03:50:19,920 --> 03:50:21,920
Uh

2890
03:50:25,520 --> 03:50:28,480
Uh, I'm gonna just accept it

2891
03:50:28,480 --> 03:50:30,480
Oh

2892
03:50:34,080 --> 03:50:42,960
My first reeflings that was a good attempt again that bleed damage is crazy. Does anyone have any more bleed damage boat anyone anyone?

2893
03:50:45,120 --> 03:50:47,520
It's okay. I can use the wreck the usual

2894
03:50:50,320 --> 03:50:52,480
Uh, what was that for those

2895
03:50:53,440 --> 03:50:57,280
What is this scarlet rock, you know blood loss as well?

2896
03:50:58,560 --> 03:51:01,440
And then what are you hair fumer's ball?

2897
03:51:07,600 --> 03:51:12,080
How is this danger? Oh, how is this damage done with the fire?

2898
03:51:17,600 --> 03:51:19,600
And then

2899
03:51:20,400 --> 03:51:23,200
Saru, did you come in really early? I think you might have

2900
03:51:29,040 --> 03:51:32,960
Again, I'm sorry if I'm kind of thinking over you. Please please give me patience

2901
03:51:33,040 --> 03:51:38,160
I'm trying to let everyone get a chance to to be the victor to be the one to win the boss with me

2902
03:51:40,080 --> 03:51:46,560
Wow, let me recalibrate my mouth. It's hardly moving. Oh, wow. I just hit my funny bone on the freaking

2903
03:51:50,160 --> 03:51:53,440
Oh shit calibrate my eyes wrong

2904
03:51:56,560 --> 03:51:58,560
Wait a minute

2905
03:51:58,720 --> 03:52:00,720
I think I lost my conscious

2906
03:52:03,760 --> 03:52:05,760
Okay, let's do

2907
03:52:07,200 --> 03:52:13,520
You can do this mom is doing her best. Um, I'm spraying and praying. Okay. Mwah. Mwah. Are you guys ready?

2908
03:52:14,400 --> 03:52:20,240
Do you need to do any special spells and incantations or anything for the win? I never actually know

2909
03:52:20,320 --> 03:52:22,320
I was just like pushed through the thing

2910
03:52:22,720 --> 03:52:27,120
I don't know. Okay. No. Oh shit. I missed it. Oh, no, you guys did it. Okay, fine

2911
03:52:28,720 --> 03:52:30,720
Uh, I'd like

2912
03:52:32,560 --> 03:52:34,560
I don't mind taking aggro

2913
03:52:35,840 --> 03:52:39,280
As if that's three fucking bastard of a

2914
03:52:39,280 --> 03:52:41,280
Uh

2915
03:52:42,160 --> 03:52:46,560
Like magical sword. Let me hold on you get closer. I'm like destroying all the back

2916
03:52:53,280 --> 03:52:55,280
And we take aggro when we do like

2917
03:52:58,240 --> 03:53:00,240
Yeah

2918
03:53:10,000 --> 03:53:17,440
I'm feeling very risky and very cocky this time. Like I'm wanting to go all in. I want to get close

2919
03:53:21,440 --> 03:53:25,200
I think she's taking frost damage, which needs to take 90 percent more damage

2920
03:53:30,320 --> 03:53:32,320
We're gonna need to do bleep bill

2921
03:53:34,560 --> 03:53:37,200
Oh, I'm out. Hold on. I'm out. Mommy's out. Hold on. Mommy's just

2922
03:53:37,920 --> 03:53:39,920
Uh, change her bolts

2923
03:53:42,320 --> 03:53:44,880
She's looking at me. I know she's not. I was fine. I can keep going

2924
03:53:46,480 --> 03:53:53,200
It's like some bolts here. I mean, it's the scarlet has been applied and she's just slowly working in

2925
03:54:03,200 --> 03:54:05,200
Okay, what's that normal

2926
03:54:08,160 --> 03:54:10,480
Okay, phase two has been achieved reef link

2927
03:54:17,360 --> 03:54:23,200
Completely balls that one up fully. Oh, oh my reef ones. No

2928
03:54:26,720 --> 03:54:28,720
You know, the only band with fire

2929
03:54:32,480 --> 03:54:34,480
Hold on

2930
03:54:35,440 --> 03:54:39,360
She has scarlet raw. So can I just run around like a maniac?

2931
03:54:41,840 --> 03:54:43,840
Get aggro

2932
03:54:45,760 --> 03:54:51,680
One two three shit far too, right I need calls in between that one

2933
03:54:56,480 --> 03:55:01,840
I've only got normal left hold on I'm helping though. That's an unhit

2934
03:55:05,440 --> 03:55:09,200
One hit. How is one hit taken out of my weak link?

2935
03:55:13,280 --> 03:55:18,080
I just made it no more. Rot won't last long enough without a sword

2936
03:55:23,760 --> 03:55:26,080
Is this thing from something better than anyone?

2937
03:55:26,960 --> 03:55:30,160
It's a race of learning and challenges that feel intimate

2938
03:55:30,880 --> 03:55:32,160
I

2939
03:55:32,160 --> 03:55:34,160
Double attacking faces

2940
03:55:36,240 --> 03:55:38,240
You're telling me

2941
03:55:53,680 --> 03:55:55,680
About time you've not been in for a hot

2942
03:56:00,880 --> 03:56:02,880
But

2943
03:56:04,640 --> 03:56:06,640
Hold on

2944
03:56:30,160 --> 03:56:32,160
You want him

2945
03:57:00,160 --> 03:57:02,160
You

2946
03:57:15,520 --> 03:57:18,960
So just gemos hydration check, okay hydration check

2947
03:57:19,520 --> 03:57:21,520
So

2948
03:57:29,760 --> 03:57:34,240
Right I think all of this I was good in the hood

2949
03:57:36,640 --> 03:57:38,400
Okay

2950
03:57:38,400 --> 03:57:45,040
Oh, you give me eyes in. Thank you. I got some balls. Oh, hold on. Let's do the blessings the ritual if you will

2951
03:57:45,760 --> 03:57:47,760
Who are you?

2952
03:57:48,160 --> 03:57:53,920
Are you a are you a blessing on to shield you from the blessing itself? Right? Are we ready refund?

2953
03:57:55,440 --> 03:57:57,440
You're beautiful

2954
03:57:57,840 --> 03:58:00,400
You didn't do the whimpering one. You're supposed to go. Oh

2955
03:58:02,240 --> 03:58:06,480
Oh, we got blessing blessing blessing any blessers blessing

2956
03:58:08,800 --> 03:58:10,800
See if I can get my souls

2957
03:58:11,680 --> 03:58:18,560
I'll take it. Oh, I never put any more bolts on 15. I can only have normal bolts to help out

2958
03:58:21,040 --> 03:58:24,160
If I only have normal bolts, I feel like I should probably just do that

2959
03:58:31,840 --> 03:58:37,680
I can at least take some I grow I didn't mean like that. Oh, someone put like a necronomic effect on her. She was like

2960
03:58:37,680 --> 03:58:39,680
Oh

2961
03:58:48,240 --> 03:58:53,040
I have to admit my bleep damaged bolts were pretty much carrying I'm a

2962
03:58:53,040 --> 03:58:59,440
Boy, I'm not gonna lie. I think my balls were carrying a little

2963
03:59:02,880 --> 03:59:05,200
If someone's poisoned her that wasn't me

2964
03:59:06,800 --> 03:59:11,040
She's been poisoned. She's been poisoned. Hold on. I'm missing all my good shots

2965
03:59:14,080 --> 03:59:16,320
I'm gonna take some aggro off of them because they are

2966
03:59:19,600 --> 03:59:21,600
Not this kind of aggro

2967
03:59:23,280 --> 03:59:25,280
Oh

2968
03:59:27,040 --> 03:59:32,400
I'm missing all my good adults my crossbow bolts. I think I might just have to do bow and arrow

2969
03:59:35,040 --> 03:59:41,840
And because I've got like a billion bleep bow and arrow, so I think maybe hold on. Can I do that now?

2970
03:59:42,800 --> 03:59:44,800
Hold on a minute

2971
03:59:46,160 --> 03:59:48,400
Is this gonna do what I think it's gonna do

2972
03:59:48,880 --> 03:59:56,400
Is it doing what I think it's doing and it's gonna give her a bleed

2973
03:59:58,880 --> 04:00:00,560
Oh

2974
04:00:00,560 --> 04:00:07,680
Not with that. Oh, I was too. I need to it. It's dodge pause dodge for that the big arrow

2975
04:00:08,640 --> 04:00:10,640
It's just doing what I think

2976
04:00:15,920 --> 04:00:17,920
Face to cheese

2977
04:00:19,360 --> 04:00:25,680
Someone's poison spore and are like crazy and then fifth swipe. No little reflin

2978
04:00:28,160 --> 04:00:30,160
One just one

2979
04:00:34,480 --> 04:00:36,480
Okay, oh

2980
04:00:36,640 --> 04:00:42,400
Right, so am I taking some bleep damage doing this or no, I just like

2981
04:00:44,400 --> 04:00:47,280
Applying bleed, okay, so it is doing it is doing it

2982
04:00:48,560 --> 04:00:51,920
Ah, we can do it reflin. We can do it. I believe I believe I believe

2983
04:00:58,160 --> 04:01:01,120
Because someone said if we if we defeat her we're good to go

2984
04:01:02,320 --> 04:01:07,520
Like if we defeat her we are good to go. We are doing it. I just say full of a zero

2985
04:01:08,080 --> 04:01:14,240
Sweet name. You got this strong. Thank you for the five disciple of a zero. Oh, you gotta be bleeding heart

2986
04:01:15,200 --> 04:01:18,000
Mugi, have you had the thing shot yet? I don't think you have

2987
04:01:20,080 --> 04:01:22,080
Here's the accent

2988
04:01:23,680 --> 04:01:26,880
You may have been slightly recent. I'm not sure

2989
04:01:36,160 --> 04:01:41,680
Oh, I have to admit I'm starting to get a bit. I'm not sure who's been in and who's not

2990
04:01:44,880 --> 04:01:48,240
My brain is not very switched on. Thank you for the five disciple of a zero

2991
04:01:49,840 --> 04:01:54,720
Do the whimper do the whimper. I want the whimper one. Not your beautiful. Or do you not have the whimper one?

2992
04:02:03,760 --> 04:02:06,560
Hit to go and the other bosses are kind of just as hard

2993
04:02:06,720 --> 04:02:09,040
No, don't say that. No. No. No. I don't want to hear that

2994
04:02:09,760 --> 04:02:13,440
I don't want to hear such accusations against the other bosses of this game

2995
04:02:14,240 --> 04:02:20,480
And the in the wise words of ever came in is that you that came in and said if you do it, you uh, we win. Okay, so we're gonna win

2996
04:02:23,040 --> 04:02:25,760
You just need to level up Mugi. Mugi items

2997
04:02:27,600 --> 04:02:31,920
Uh, what was I doing? I was actually just straight up doing a bow and bow bow and arrow

2998
04:02:33,120 --> 04:02:35,120
There'll be no blowing arrows in this house

2999
04:02:35,840 --> 04:02:37,840
Oh

3000
04:02:37,840 --> 04:02:42,960
Enemy reefling you can't come in you silly bobo Billy. You can't come in. We're about to do a boss

3001
04:02:44,960 --> 04:02:51,440
I'm gonna just let you do what you need to do out here. Okay, we'll grab my soles

3002
04:02:53,680 --> 04:02:55,680
I'm going in

3003
04:02:56,240 --> 04:02:58,240
Let's get to work

3004
04:03:02,560 --> 04:03:05,060
Sorry, sorry, I wasn't paying attention that well

3005
04:03:15,200 --> 04:03:17,200
Wow

3006
04:03:21,440 --> 04:03:24,000
Sorry, my eyes are getting tired

3007
04:03:25,360 --> 04:03:27,360
I'm not paying attention

3008
04:03:27,600 --> 04:03:30,720
Right, I need a lock in I'm locking in I'm in I'm locked

3009
04:03:32,080 --> 04:03:34,080
The key

3010
04:03:34,560 --> 04:03:38,720
Okay, so if I cross this is taking what 20 percent more damage overall

3011
04:03:38,720 --> 04:03:40,720
Okay

3012
04:03:45,120 --> 04:03:48,800
We're all can share and I grow one sway and then oh

3013
04:03:50,640 --> 04:03:55,920
Wait, it's far too long to do that. I will get it. I will get it. I will get six

3014
04:04:01,280 --> 04:04:06,480
I'm I just like a hundred pair bull honestly a hundred pair bull. I'm doing a

3015
04:04:09,680 --> 04:04:13,120
I mean, it's all right

3016
04:04:17,440 --> 04:04:20,240
No, okay, I'm completely missing I need to get closer

3017
04:04:26,640 --> 04:04:33,760
Oh bleep bleep bleep I saw it I saw it we got a successful bleed phase two incoming phase two incoming

3018
04:04:34,000 --> 04:04:36,000
Oh

3019
04:04:36,720 --> 04:04:38,720
We got knocked down

3020
04:04:40,640 --> 04:04:42,640
Oh

3021
04:04:44,880 --> 04:04:48,720
We're doing it we're doing it don't get too cocky

3022
04:04:50,560 --> 04:04:52,560
We get too cocky

3023
04:04:52,640 --> 04:04:54,640
That's fine

3024
04:04:57,520 --> 04:05:01,440
Oh, she's so volatile she's so volatile

3025
04:05:04,480 --> 04:05:06,480
Yeah

3026
04:05:06,880 --> 04:05:09,680
Take it like a man. I'm coming at you

3027
04:05:12,400 --> 04:05:15,440
We're gonna do it. She is so hard

3028
04:05:16,480 --> 04:05:18,480
That's phase two how fast

3029
04:05:19,280 --> 04:05:25,280
The chip damage also results in 10 percent blasto bleed and those were two actually. Is that how she went down?

3030
04:05:26,800 --> 04:05:31,920
Oh god, I finally showed up used the red just to confirm. So you only show up in red

3031
04:05:32,880 --> 04:05:37,760
I don't see right or as in it shouldn't do that. I'm not sure why

3032
04:05:40,480 --> 04:05:44,480
Oh, wait, okay, hold on. I think we're going to bleed damage route. Let's get you in bleed

3033
04:05:45,200 --> 04:05:47,840
If we all do bleed because I've got bleed arrows

3034
04:05:48,880 --> 04:05:50,880
and

3035
04:05:55,760 --> 04:05:57,840
Have you been in for a bit? I don't think you have been

3036
04:05:58,400 --> 04:06:02,160
I don't know. I've not got a clue

3037
04:06:03,760 --> 04:06:09,360
I've no got a clue. Sorry. Nothing's getting more cruzier by the second. So you can only come in as an enemy that's

3038
04:06:09,760 --> 04:06:11,760
No

3039
04:06:11,920 --> 04:06:13,920
Oh, wait, someone timed out

3040
04:06:14,400 --> 04:06:16,400
Who couldn't come in?

3041
04:06:18,080 --> 04:06:20,080
Uh

3042
04:06:21,920 --> 04:06:23,920
Oh

3043
04:06:24,880 --> 04:06:27,840
Hey timed out. Oh bleeds timed out

3044
04:06:31,600 --> 04:06:37,440
Inappropriate activity nothing. That's strange bug. I wonder what the code means for that

3045
04:06:38,960 --> 04:06:40,960
Wait, the other one switched out as well

3046
04:06:41,680 --> 04:06:46,960
It's really not it's haven't oh there you go. And then you can have a shot. It's really having a hard time

3047
04:06:47,840 --> 04:06:52,880
Like I don't get me wrong. I know like literally everyone in their nan is on elven ring right now. Um

3048
04:06:54,400 --> 04:06:56,400
Yes, I'm in a hard time

3049
04:06:56,480 --> 04:06:59,760
Okay, I think our ritual is gonna have to be kisses because

3050
04:07:01,120 --> 04:07:04,080
Um, it's taking me a hot second

3051
04:07:04,720 --> 04:07:10,320
To get into the win this boss. I don't know how long we've been at this boss floor. We've been at them for like two hours

3052
04:07:11,760 --> 04:07:15,840
I think we might need to do bleed against her. Are you two ready to do bleed?

3053
04:07:17,440 --> 04:07:19,440
I'm gonna do a figure eight around you. Oh

3054
04:07:20,160 --> 04:07:22,160
items here

3055
04:07:22,560 --> 04:07:24,560
I can pull my crossbow ball again

3056
04:07:26,480 --> 04:07:29,200
I'll burn through it unless I do that one instead

3057
04:07:31,280 --> 04:07:33,280
Yeah, thank you

3058
04:07:33,440 --> 04:07:38,640
Right, okay. We're ready. We're not ready going to battle. Uh, I think if we lose this one

3059
04:07:38,720 --> 04:07:41,840
I think it may this just seems like a bleed one

3060
04:07:42,640 --> 04:07:44,640
And we should just bleed out the wazoo

3061
04:07:45,440 --> 04:07:49,360
Um, oh my swords are literally mid map. Lovely

3062
04:07:50,160 --> 04:07:53,280
Haha, you were casting. Thank you. You got hit by my spell

3063
04:07:54,960 --> 04:08:00,160
I'm sorry. Other people never thought you hurt there. Yeah. Dang. What was that?

3064
04:08:02,080 --> 04:08:04,240
Hold on. Let me grab my sword real quick

3065
04:08:10,160 --> 04:08:15,840
That's just a reactive model on just so you know how absolutely crazy I love the screen

3066
04:08:15,840 --> 04:08:17,840
Okay

3067
04:08:18,960 --> 04:08:20,960
Okay

3068
04:08:26,720 --> 04:08:28,720
Okay

3069
04:08:29,680 --> 04:08:31,680
We're taking our time

3070
04:08:32,880 --> 04:08:34,880
Fucking I

3071
04:08:38,640 --> 04:08:40,640
Okay

3072
04:08:46,800 --> 04:08:48,800
Oh

3073
04:08:51,600 --> 04:08:53,600
Oh no

3074
04:08:54,080 --> 04:08:58,000
What does that do? Oh, it rains thunder from above

3075
04:09:04,480 --> 04:09:07,760
There we go, I didn't say I was like this when I hit that button

3076
04:09:10,160 --> 04:09:15,040
I'm gonna try and keep too early too early far too early, but it still works out

3077
04:09:15,840 --> 04:09:17,840
Okay

3078
04:09:35,760 --> 04:09:41,360
I can't even dodge that third one. She just did there that was impossible to dodge with it. It's not, can he be?

3079
04:09:42,000 --> 04:09:44,000
The game's still like that

3080
04:09:44,640 --> 04:09:51,520
Okay, we're entering phase two. We're entering phase two soon, soon p.m

3081
04:09:54,320 --> 04:09:56,320
We are

3082
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:03,920
Okay, phase two has been entered careful snow globes or ice globes are

3083
04:10:05,680 --> 04:10:08,640
Wow, that's so beautiful. Let me see if I want to go to sleep

3084
04:10:09,360 --> 04:10:12,960
Don't do that move again. Let me see if I want to go to sleep one. Wait, that hit me

3085
04:10:14,480 --> 04:10:20,560
I thought I dodged that to be honest. I must be my reaction time must be absolutely garbage

3086
04:10:21,040 --> 04:10:23,040
Wait, the other reefling perished

3087
04:10:23,600 --> 04:10:26,000
Oh, no, sorry. I didn't even know it

3088
04:10:27,360 --> 04:10:29,360
Oh, I'm trying to like counter

3089
04:10:44,240 --> 04:10:46,240
Oh

3090
04:11:04,480 --> 04:11:09,040
Sorry, I'm actually trying to focus, but I can't, oh my god, I'm actually focusing on my crystal

3091
04:11:14,960 --> 04:11:16,960
I'm trying I'm trying

3092
04:11:18,800 --> 04:11:20,800
I'm trying

3093
04:11:21,360 --> 04:11:27,760
Sen, you're fucking Sen, are you killed her? I'm actually focusing up. Literally. I stopped talking focus up instantly gets

3094
04:11:28,240 --> 04:11:30,240
a too shorted

3095
04:11:31,200 --> 04:11:33,200
Sen, have you killed her? She's at

3096
04:11:33,760 --> 04:11:37,120
a castle lord chamber. I'm going absolutely fucking gold

3097
04:11:38,880 --> 04:11:41,360
Okay bleed we're gonna try and get you in this time

3098
04:11:42,320 --> 04:11:44,880
If we're I think bleed is the way to get her

3099
04:11:46,800 --> 04:11:50,640
I think I had you in the end, but we seem to be in norm. You've not been in a hotspot

3100
04:11:54,240 --> 04:11:59,520
I've not been there yet. Oh my god, so except for what's to come brah. It's so fucking out. Are you doing it solo?

3101
04:11:59,600 --> 04:12:01,600
Are you playing with the imps?

3102
04:12:02,480 --> 04:12:07,440
Get the imps to carry you so you can actually enjoy the the story more than anything else

3103
04:12:08,240 --> 04:12:10,240
Even though the story is so arbitrary

3104
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:16,080
We're turning the music off hell. I mean, I'm happy to turn it down

3105
04:12:17,600 --> 04:12:19,600
No

3106
04:12:19,920 --> 04:12:22,160
We'll put the music down by two

3107
04:12:22,160 --> 04:12:24,880
Just to see if we can maybe hear cues a bit more

3108
04:12:25,440 --> 04:12:29,840
She summons imps only for the scorpions. I believe that because

3109
04:12:30,640 --> 04:12:34,480
Sen cannot stand like bugs, insects, all that kind of thing

3110
04:12:35,360 --> 04:12:37,360
Yeah, and we're doing a gluck gluck circle

3111
04:12:41,520 --> 04:12:48,640
I'm doing solo, but oh my god, the scorpions in that castle tried to get imps to clear them out because it wouldn't work because the lion boss was dead. Oh

3112
04:12:50,480 --> 04:12:54,720
What we're doing and we kissing and we got a lot kissing going on. All right, you ready?

3113
04:12:56,160 --> 04:12:58,160
Okay, let's go. Let's do it

3114
04:12:58,480 --> 04:13:04,480
Yeah, literally Sen cannot stand bugs. It's actually uh, such a wee shame because it really gets her hard

3115
04:13:05,440 --> 04:13:06,400
Okay

3116
04:13:06,400 --> 04:13:10,000
The no bug girls in viola as well while we're at it

3117
04:13:11,600 --> 04:13:13,600
Let's

3118
04:13:14,000 --> 04:13:20,160
Let's get her bowl bear. I said, let's get her bowl bearings. Right. Hold on. Let's just

3119
04:13:20,960 --> 04:13:23,360
I say what's going on and then we can start firing

3120
04:13:29,840 --> 04:13:31,840
Okay

3121
04:13:32,960 --> 04:13:35,840
Okay, bleach seems to be the way to kill this night

3122
04:13:36,720 --> 04:13:41,840
Oh, wait, sorry, I was freaking loading

3123
04:13:46,880 --> 04:13:48,880
The acres on me

3124
04:13:51,280 --> 04:13:56,320
We're gonna go for the cheeky bleeds. Oh, we got bleeds. We got bleeds. We got big bleeds there

3125
04:13:57,520 --> 04:13:59,520
Oh fantastic

3126
04:14:00,240 --> 04:14:05,840
Okay, bleeds is the way to go against this character. There's um, I cannot be

3127
04:14:08,640 --> 04:14:14,560
Why are you getting so full right jump wait in odd? Why did I jump?

3128
04:14:16,320 --> 04:14:20,080
I don't know why I jumped I meant dodge and then wait and then jump

3129
04:14:20,880 --> 04:14:22,560
And if we know

3130
04:14:22,560 --> 04:14:24,560
I know what I mean. I can't say it right right now

3131
04:14:25,120 --> 04:14:27,120
Who's she looking at?

3132
04:14:27,200 --> 04:14:29,200
She's looking at me

3133
04:14:30,240 --> 04:14:32,240
And one more for luck

3134
04:14:37,360 --> 04:14:42,160
Okay, let's see if we can get another bleach soon tm. Oh, not on me though

3135
04:14:43,920 --> 04:14:45,920
Oh, not on me though

3136
04:14:46,880 --> 04:14:51,200
Yeah, see that change it's so volatile that change in aggro is just

3137
04:14:51,760 --> 04:14:55,760
It's almost unpredictable because it looks like she's not even gonna charge off or dude

3138
04:14:56,320 --> 04:15:01,600
How does that always hit? Do I need to roll into it or like roll directly forward into it possibly?

3139
04:15:02,240 --> 04:15:04,240
Or roll directly backwards

3140
04:15:05,920 --> 04:15:07,920
I'm gonna feel like he oh

3141
04:15:08,880 --> 04:15:11,280
Okay, okay. Okay. We're cooking

3142
04:15:13,760 --> 04:15:15,760
We're cooking

3143
04:15:16,080 --> 04:15:19,040
Let's see if I can get a bleed for these fucking bow and arrows

3144
04:15:20,240 --> 04:15:22,240
So I'm not the useless

3145
04:15:22,240 --> 04:15:25,600
Well, I'm pretty useless, but you know what I mean, you know what I mean

3146
04:15:40,800 --> 04:15:46,800
That was it that was the fucking run and all I had to do was dodge some blue lights

3147
04:15:47,360 --> 04:15:50,720
Man, all I had to do was dodge some blood and legs

3148
04:15:53,040 --> 04:15:59,120
I like bugs in real life, but the ones in gains are overkill. The scuttle says bro. I ran past that entire section

3149
04:15:59,120 --> 04:16:03,680
I missed off a stat. I was to pick up something out of statue and I completely like ignored it

3150
04:16:06,400 --> 04:16:09,840
Uh, Jess did I get you Henry? I don't think I get Jess back in again

3151
04:16:11,840 --> 04:16:15,120
Uh, Taku and Jess you're gonna be my joy this time

3152
04:16:15,520 --> 04:16:17,520
I

3153
04:16:17,920 --> 04:16:24,160
Hope everyone's got a bleed build brought back the images of how those baby scurfs playing to their mama and whores

3154
04:16:24,560 --> 04:16:27,040
It's kind of weird that you wouldn't think instinct

3155
04:16:27,760 --> 04:16:31,280
Like instincts and bugs kind of have that thing going for them, but uh

3156
04:16:33,920 --> 04:16:37,440
That is good gotta roll through it anything else you just don't clear

3157
04:16:37,520 --> 04:16:41,440
Yeah, it's like I got a roll like right forward into that big swipe. She does

3158
04:16:42,400 --> 04:16:45,600
So we know we now know her biggest weakness

3159
04:16:46,320 --> 04:16:48,320
buzz

3160
04:16:48,320 --> 04:16:50,320
with our bug

3161
04:16:52,160 --> 04:16:54,400
Okay, hopefully you two are on

3162
04:16:55,440 --> 04:16:57,440
bleed

3163
04:17:00,800 --> 04:17:02,400
Uh

3164
04:17:02,400 --> 04:17:05,760
What's he doing? He's gonna be crying chan. What does this say?

3165
04:17:06,640 --> 04:17:08,640
Freeze the pincer attack

3166
04:17:09,760 --> 04:17:12,880
Over again blast. We have been blessed. Let's go

3167
04:17:14,400 --> 04:17:19,680
Let's do it. Let's do it 20 minute adventure reeflings

3168
04:17:23,040 --> 04:17:30,240
Right, I'm fucking falling asleep clearly. I've had enough clearly. I've had enough because I'm falling asleep getting attacked by the easy

3169
04:17:36,480 --> 04:17:40,400
I take aggro to give that reefing some space

3170
04:17:46,160 --> 04:17:48,960
Yeah, they get locked into that attack which is fine with me

3171
04:17:56,560 --> 04:17:58,560
Right heel heel mother

3172
04:18:06,560 --> 04:18:08,560
You know

3173
04:18:08,880 --> 04:18:12,080
Oh, we got a hit we got a hit that was a big chunk whatever that was

3174
04:18:12,240 --> 04:18:15,520
I don't know if that was a bleed or not. I see frost damage though

3175
04:18:16,720 --> 04:18:18,240
My game crashed

3176
04:18:18,240 --> 04:18:20,240
My game crashed. Hello

3177
04:18:21,120 --> 04:18:23,120
My game literally just crashed

3178
04:18:23,600 --> 04:18:25,600
I'm back though. I like just pause

3179
04:18:26,640 --> 04:18:28,640
Did you guys see that?

3180
04:18:29,520 --> 04:18:31,520
Are you teabagging?

3181
04:18:31,840 --> 04:18:33,840
Oh my god, did you see that though?

3182
04:18:34,800 --> 04:18:40,400
I'm surprised we're even still here. I thought that the thing was gonna explode. Sorry. I'm not paying attention

3183
04:18:41,040 --> 04:18:43,040
die

3184
04:18:43,680 --> 04:18:49,520
Oh god, I the one I would have died if I didn't dodge that. I'm not gonna lie. I think I would have been born

3185
04:18:55,840 --> 04:19:02,320
Oh, yeah, oh, sorry, I was uh, I never pay attention to that attack. Honestly. Sorry, my dumb ass fall asleep

3186
04:19:02,560 --> 04:19:04,800
I am I may as well be asleep right now

3187
04:19:07,200 --> 04:19:10,960
I'm gonna feel health. I just don't like having more health

3188
04:19:12,000 --> 04:19:15,840
Considering how easy it is to get one shot if I am

3189
04:19:16,640 --> 04:19:17,600
well

3190
04:19:17,600 --> 04:19:19,600
Two in a wee bit of short

3191
04:19:25,840 --> 04:19:27,840
Oh

3192
04:19:32,480 --> 04:19:38,720
See when I can take aggro like that, it's fantastic for the reason we need to like move in and just have our ease

3193
04:19:40,640 --> 04:19:42,640
If I can keep aggro

3194
04:19:43,600 --> 04:19:47,840
Okay, one swing wait swing again. Oh, we finally did it

3195
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:52,000
Finally

3196
04:19:53,520 --> 04:19:56,400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

3197
04:19:57,920 --> 04:20:00,980
Are you both dead? Oh, don't be so selfish

3198
04:20:02,480 --> 04:20:04,480
Don't be so selfish

3199
04:20:07,600 --> 04:20:10,000
You haven't managed to live long enough to run out of healing

3200
04:20:11,040 --> 04:20:13,040
So you're good to keep going

3201
04:20:13,600 --> 04:20:16,400
It's a ration healing when the problem is restrained easy

3202
04:20:17,040 --> 04:20:21,920
Did you know that performance drops after the four hour mark? It doesn't matter if it's physical or mental

3203
04:20:22,640 --> 04:20:24,160
I am

3204
04:20:24,160 --> 04:20:28,880
But if I don't have to perform when the reef links are carrying man, it doesn't count

3205
04:20:29,840 --> 04:20:34,880
And we go again, right? How about that? I'm not allowed to go to sleep until we went against this boss

3206
04:20:35,200 --> 04:20:39,920
That seems like a fair go. I'm trying to remember who I've not had in the longest

3207
04:20:41,120 --> 04:20:43,120
I'm trying I'm trying

3208
04:20:44,640 --> 04:20:49,200
I think you and you haven't been in the longest

3209
04:20:52,560 --> 04:20:54,560
It's all our fault no

3210
04:20:54,880 --> 04:20:58,160
The internet killed me. Literally my fucking thing

3211
04:20:59,120 --> 04:21:02,080
So today was the first time I got summoned in this game ever

3212
04:21:02,160 --> 04:21:04,000
I didn't know I would have

3213
04:21:04,000 --> 04:21:10,320
Half my heels and I guess it kind of scales the damage of the boss. It's also kind of hard even missing it. Oh, no, it is like

3214
04:21:11,600 --> 04:21:17,440
I suck at the game and I basically have two reef links that are nerfed into the ground to help me

3215
04:21:18,400 --> 04:21:26,000
Okay, if there is a big gigger Chad Elton player come now so she can go to sleep. Oh, you send me a bed

3216
04:21:28,400 --> 04:21:35,760
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh, you're here to carry me like literally and figuratively in the game

3217
04:21:37,920 --> 04:21:44,400
Boss gains 20 damage and 50 health per extra player. Wait, am I really nervous am I making a words for myself?

3218
04:21:48,080 --> 04:21:50,080
Someone get let me solo her

3219
04:21:54,000 --> 04:21:56,000
Okay, just felt

3220
04:21:57,280 --> 04:22:02,640
Wait, why did that go through me? Am I going crazy? I did nothing to dodge that and it didn't hurt me

3221
04:22:04,480 --> 04:22:06,480
I think I'm losing it

3222
04:22:06,880 --> 04:22:08,160
unless

3223
04:22:08,160 --> 04:22:09,920
sorry

3224
04:22:09,920 --> 04:22:13,360
My performance is going down. I repeat my performance is going down

3225
04:22:14,240 --> 04:22:18,320
We have hit the performance mark

3226
04:22:21,120 --> 04:22:23,760
Holy crap, just throwing knives. Is that throwing knives?

3227
04:22:26,160 --> 04:22:28,160
You're making me want to use throwing knives

3228
04:22:29,680 --> 04:22:36,640
Okay, avoid wait avoid. Okay. Avoid wait avoid. That's all I have to do. I'll start start

3229
04:22:36,640 --> 04:22:38,640
Oh

3230
04:22:41,760 --> 04:22:43,760
Again they go for me. I didn't expect that

3231
04:22:46,400 --> 04:22:52,000
That's how to get you don't expect that. Oh, we need to help her. Give me aggro. Give me aggro

3232
04:22:55,520 --> 04:22:57,520
Wow

3233
04:22:58,880 --> 04:23:00,880
Give me aggro. I know like this

3234
04:23:00,880 --> 04:23:02,880
I

3235
04:23:04,640 --> 04:23:06,640
Was just one

3236
04:23:06,640 --> 04:23:09,760
It wasn't a five-phase swing. No refling

3237
04:23:10,960 --> 04:23:12,960
I can't take aggro

3238
04:23:13,600 --> 04:23:18,640
It's not giving me aggro. I ain't go aggro. Successfully. It's exactly

3239
04:23:26,800 --> 04:23:28,800
Oh

3240
04:23:30,880 --> 04:23:34,880
The bluetooth device as uh

3241
04:23:49,840 --> 04:23:51,840
Oh piss I didn't expect that

3242
04:23:52,080 --> 04:23:54,080
Oh

3243
04:23:56,880 --> 04:24:00,720
You guys are doing so well though, you guys are getting so close

3244
04:24:03,520 --> 04:24:05,520
You guys are doing so well

3245
04:24:08,160 --> 04:24:10,880
Every time she slips behind me and trashes me

3246
04:24:11,840 --> 04:24:16,000
Just not just in game, but also out of the carriage into her farm

3247
04:24:17,200 --> 04:24:19,600
She hits like a truck. Oh, she does like

3248
04:24:20,320 --> 04:24:25,680
The buffs and the the combo in the second phase is just unforgiving. It really is

3249
04:24:26,640 --> 04:24:28,640
Mushroom man not had you about

3250
04:24:31,920 --> 04:24:33,920
Uh russian

3251
04:24:35,600 --> 04:24:38,720
No, I'm not writing down names anymore. I'm just trying to guess on my head

3252
04:24:39,600 --> 04:24:41,600
Which is a probably a terrible way to do it

3253
04:24:42,320 --> 04:24:49,120
Right you two have not seen any of me that edge and ring would fuck. Please. Let me have it this sweet release

3254
04:24:49,840 --> 04:24:51,840
Honestly though

3255
04:24:57,040 --> 04:25:00,800
There's no need for this guy for half of your carry story on the farm

3256
04:25:01,520 --> 04:25:05,520
With all the chickens and the ducks that eat the piss and all the plants that we have

3257
04:25:06,560 --> 04:25:08,560
The amazing

3258
04:25:08,880 --> 04:25:12,720
Meanwhile me parrying the black knight downstairs for an hour on y'all

3259
04:25:13,440 --> 04:25:15,440
Right. Are you ready? Mwah. Mwah

3260
04:25:16,080 --> 04:25:18,880
We'll see if we get all you carry you offer to carry me

3261
04:25:19,440 --> 04:25:25,680
Let's see if your actions speak louder than your words. No, no, let's see if your remote speaks louder than your

3262
04:25:26,640 --> 04:25:28,640
implications

3263
04:25:28,800 --> 04:25:32,960
Because either it's gonna happen. Are we getting blessed? Oh, we got blessed

3264
04:25:33,840 --> 04:25:37,360
Blessed to impress forget dressed to impress. We are blessed to prevent

3265
04:25:39,680 --> 04:25:41,520
Give me these souls

3266
04:25:41,520 --> 04:25:42,960
Wait, whoa

3267
04:25:42,960 --> 04:25:44,960
I lost aggro as soon as I came in

3268
04:25:45,440 --> 04:25:47,440
Oh

3269
04:26:11,440 --> 04:26:13,440
Oh my god that bleed though

3270
04:26:14,000 --> 04:26:16,000
Oh my god, I couldn't get her awful

3271
04:26:20,320 --> 04:26:27,520
Okay, so even though my crossbow doesn't do much damage if I get up leading it's almost like it makes up for the missing damage

3272
04:26:28,400 --> 04:26:30,400
Does that make any sense whatsoever?

3273
04:26:37,760 --> 04:26:42,480
We flings remove this woman right now from my game eliminate her

3274
04:26:44,080 --> 04:26:46,080
She's so hard for no reason

3275
04:26:49,440 --> 04:26:51,440
Is there anyone that's male?

3276
04:26:54,640 --> 04:26:56,960
I react far too late

3277
04:27:00,960 --> 04:27:04,400
The bleed is the prop where your damage is hidden. So you just got to build it up

3278
04:27:05,200 --> 04:27:08,080
You could also drop her could could this

3279
04:27:09,440 --> 04:27:11,440
The poison bills might do the trick

3280
04:27:14,320 --> 04:27:18,560
I haven't been in for a single time. What's your name?

3281
04:27:21,360 --> 04:27:23,360
In game

3282
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:26,000
I'll try and get everyone in

3283
04:27:26,800 --> 04:27:28,800
Oh, sorry

3284
04:27:29,760 --> 04:27:31,760
Shadow realm blessing

3285
04:27:33,840 --> 04:27:38,160
Oh, I don't know why any of that pushes but he will

3286
04:27:38,560 --> 04:27:40,560
Uh

3287
04:27:43,920 --> 04:27:49,360
Partially I'm running out of effects. I just have like default bolts, which is fine. It's not problem

3288
04:27:52,560 --> 04:27:54,640
Upgrade it. Oh my apologies. Sorry

3289
04:27:57,200 --> 04:27:59,200
Shadow realm blessing sacred tree

3290
04:27:59,520 --> 04:28:06,400
Consume sacred tree fragments to bolster your blessings the blessing bolsters the acceptance ability to deal and negate damage

3291
04:28:06,400 --> 04:28:08,880
But has no influence outside of the realm

3292
04:28:09,680 --> 04:28:11,680
sure

3293
04:28:13,920 --> 04:28:15,440
For you

3294
04:28:15,440 --> 04:28:23,360
Reverend spirit the reverence fillet blessing bolsters both summon spirit and spectral speed ability to deal and negate damage

3295
04:28:24,880 --> 04:28:29,200
Wait, so they were like, okay, we know the game's too hard. So we're going to introduce this

3296
04:28:31,520 --> 04:28:33,520
That's quite humorous, honestly

3297
04:28:37,040 --> 04:28:39,040
Uh, it increases damage

3298
04:28:40,640 --> 04:28:43,200
My name in game is Bella. Hold on

3299
04:28:47,280 --> 04:28:53,520
Uh, there we go stream sniped you from across the room. I had you

3300
04:28:57,280 --> 04:28:59,280
Fennec's been in on the whole

3301
04:29:00,000 --> 04:29:05,200
Yes, you have had in the tent. I think fennec's is the one who's not had a shot in a wee while

3302
04:29:06,000 --> 04:29:08,000
Unset probably fennec set

3303
04:29:09,920 --> 04:29:11,920
Okay, fennec and then set next

3304
04:29:12,160 --> 04:29:16,000
He's not had a hot check and don't turn it back to everyone has had a chance

3305
04:29:17,200 --> 04:29:19,200
I might hop in and try and parry her

3306
04:29:20,320 --> 04:29:26,480
I don't know how you guys have the reaction time for a parry. I think the last time I did like a reaction time test

3307
04:29:26,560 --> 04:29:28,560
I was like 162

3308
04:29:29,360 --> 04:29:31,360
ms, which wasn't the worst

3309
04:29:32,160 --> 04:29:35,920
But it wasn't exactly like I'm an elite gamer. I'll need to see what it is now

3310
04:29:35,920 --> 04:29:38,960
I feel like it's probably going way down like I'm just a tired bean

3311
04:29:39,840 --> 04:29:41,840
Are you ready?

3312
04:29:42,640 --> 04:29:44,640
Are you ready?

3313
04:29:44,880 --> 04:29:46,880
Are you steady?

3314
04:29:51,120 --> 04:29:53,680
Oh, no, fennec's is suck. Oh, no, he's giving me so

3315
04:29:55,680 --> 04:29:57,360
Poison

3316
04:29:57,360 --> 04:30:00,240
Because you're poison. Oh, you give me balls

3317
04:30:02,400 --> 04:30:05,280
You are giving me bolts. I can put these on bolts

3318
04:30:06,560 --> 04:30:07,840
bolts

3319
04:30:07,840 --> 04:30:09,600
and then

3320
04:30:09,600 --> 04:30:14,000
Poison so we're going to do blood loss and poison on her. Yeah

3321
04:30:14,800 --> 04:30:19,920
Hell yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. Oh, you got the design mouse for being my sugar daddy in game

3322
04:30:21,920 --> 04:30:26,720
Ready anyone doing a blessing? No, we look mainly players. So I don't think anyone's done any blessings out here

3323
04:30:28,320 --> 04:30:30,320
Okay, give me these first

3324
04:30:37,680 --> 04:30:39,680
Let's try poison

3325
04:30:42,960 --> 04:30:45,440
Okay, it's not working. That's kind of it

3326
04:30:47,040 --> 04:30:50,800
I'm going for maybe bleed dammit. No, no poison first

3327
04:30:51,680 --> 04:30:53,680
and bleed the brick out of her

3328
04:30:54,640 --> 04:30:56,640
Mate mods

3329
04:30:57,360 --> 04:31:00,720
Reflings make it to my tomato ketchup seeds inside this woman

3330
04:31:02,640 --> 04:31:04,640
Hold on. Why does it run flat out?

3331
04:31:07,600 --> 04:31:09,600
I was just

3332
04:31:15,760 --> 04:31:20,320
Okay, we've got frost right I'm going for bleed now if I see frost I'm going for bleed

3333
04:31:21,120 --> 04:31:23,520
I don't I don't know how to confirm. She's poisoned

3334
04:31:24,880 --> 04:31:27,680
And poison doesn't last neither just scarlet

3335
04:31:29,600 --> 04:31:33,600
Okay dodge wait dodge. Oh my god

3336
04:31:35,680 --> 04:31:40,480
I can't believe it. I'm actually getting good at the attack. Well. No, let's not jinx it now

3337
04:31:41,280 --> 04:31:43,280
I'm being wise enough to

3338
04:31:45,120 --> 04:31:47,120
Remember

3339
04:31:48,080 --> 04:31:50,080
The way the attack

3340
04:31:52,480 --> 04:31:54,480
Okay, I don't like that one

3341
04:31:56,720 --> 04:32:00,000
Okay, that's definitely poison I think so I'm doing blood now

3342
04:32:01,200 --> 04:32:03,200
I'm doing

3343
04:32:05,360 --> 04:32:09,360
Phase two activated look out for snow globes. That's all

3344
04:32:12,000 --> 04:32:14,000
Mummy is

3345
04:32:17,840 --> 04:32:19,840
Oh

3346
04:32:20,400 --> 04:32:26,640
No, we do get special on her that was a juicy bit of HP that was

3347
04:32:28,560 --> 04:32:30,560
I'm going for bleed

3348
04:32:31,760 --> 04:32:37,600
I don't know. She's gonna swap. I exactly what I thought she was gonna do. Hold on. I need to heal

3349
04:32:37,600 --> 04:32:39,600
She's gonna attack me

3350
04:32:46,080 --> 04:32:48,080
Okay, here we go I'm back in the fate I'm back in the fate

3351
04:33:04,080 --> 04:33:06,080
Who did I do that?

3352
04:33:07,680 --> 04:33:09,680
How did I do that?

3353
04:33:17,440 --> 04:33:20,400
Sorry my mouse is the gate trying to stay alive right now

3354
04:33:22,640 --> 04:33:24,640
Just a singular

3355
04:33:27,280 --> 04:33:29,280
It's not over until it's over

3356
04:33:37,680 --> 04:33:39,680
Oh, it's not over until it's over

3357
04:33:43,120 --> 04:33:49,600
I do not understand how some people can do no hit runs. I my mind jump

3358
04:33:50,880 --> 04:33:52,880
Fuck

3359
04:33:54,880 --> 04:33:58,000
Oh, wow, I actually survived that I didn't know I could survive that

3360
04:33:59,120 --> 04:34:01,120
That's why I was too early anyway

3361
04:34:02,160 --> 04:34:05,040
Oh my god, I didn't even know how to survive that

3362
04:34:05,760 --> 04:34:08,960
Um, that was fantastic

3363
04:34:10,400 --> 04:34:15,920
So but I had a few good dodges in there. Sorry, but like I need a few headhats for those dodges

3364
04:34:16,000 --> 04:34:19,360
Do you see some of them in there like a dodged a whole sequence?

3365
04:34:21,040 --> 04:34:23,040
I actually getting good

3366
04:34:23,680 --> 04:34:29,040
The upgrade works. So now I don't actually perish if I'm full health. I don't perish from the ASMR rifles

3367
04:34:30,240 --> 04:34:32,240
It's okay every field attempt is a lesson

3368
04:34:35,120 --> 04:34:37,120
Right. Say it. You've not been in

3369
04:34:37,520 --> 04:34:38,640
Who are you?

3370
04:34:38,640 --> 04:34:40,640
Jennifer yourself at once

3371
04:34:40,880 --> 04:34:45,200
I feel like I've let you in a few times now russian. Takun hasn't been in. I need

3372
04:34:45,760 --> 04:34:49,520
Bleed wherever he is. His breath did get a chance

3373
04:34:50,320 --> 04:34:52,880
His bleed away. I think bleed isn't here anymore

3374
04:34:58,480 --> 04:35:03,760
I can have plenty of arrows. Yeah, I do. I'll have like tons of poison and blood so

3375
04:35:05,360 --> 04:35:07,360
You did great good girls

3376
04:35:08,160 --> 04:35:10,160
Okay. Yeah

3377
04:35:10,720 --> 04:35:14,640
Those dodges are scary, but like when you have confidence

3378
04:35:15,360 --> 04:35:20,320
That you know, you can dodge it in time then it becomes like quite easy. Are you a bleed build?

3379
04:35:23,040 --> 04:35:25,360
Uh, that sword looks like a bleed to me

3380
04:35:26,720 --> 04:35:30,080
I think it'll work. Oh, oh wait. I am I am

3381
04:35:30,320 --> 04:35:32,320
What

3382
04:35:32,640 --> 04:35:37,520
What you got more balls. Thank you. Are you ready?

3383
04:35:38,880 --> 04:35:42,400
Oh, are you going to your inventory? We didn't my beloved

3384
04:35:42,960 --> 04:35:47,440
No, you need to whimper right. We're all gonna do we're gonna get the whimpering coconut soon

3385
04:35:47,440 --> 04:35:53,360
I promise you we're getting the whimpering coconut after we do this boss. We're gonna get the whimpering coconut

3386
04:35:53,360 --> 04:35:56,560
I don't know where it is, but everyone needs to get the whimpering coconut. Where's my

3387
04:36:00,960 --> 04:36:08,240
So you actually can just outrun that

3388
04:36:09,760 --> 04:36:13,280
You can outrun that. Oh god, we're all stacking. Sorry. I'm trying to get a different angle

3389
04:36:14,640 --> 04:36:19,760
In the plain field. Oh wait, that's oh no, I don't want poison build up. Sorry. Let's do poison first

3390
04:36:21,040 --> 04:36:23,200
Stop moving lady so I can hit you

3391
04:36:24,400 --> 04:36:26,400
I need to get you poisoned

3392
04:36:31,040 --> 04:36:33,040
Is

3393
04:36:35,120 --> 04:36:43,200
Is it like those twins in the original game? Oh, oh, we got poisoned. We got poisoned right. We're doing blood now

3394
04:36:44,960 --> 04:36:46,960
We're doing bleeding effect

3395
04:36:47,840 --> 04:36:51,120
If I notice the poison goes off, I will go back to poison

3396
04:36:52,080 --> 04:36:56,160
I wonder if poison and drop would be like even deadlier combo

3397
04:36:56,400 --> 04:36:58,400
Oh

3398
04:36:58,720 --> 04:37:00,720
Possibly

3399
04:37:02,560 --> 04:37:05,520
I knew that was coming from me had my damn name on it

3400
04:37:08,480 --> 04:37:10,480
Oh

3401
04:37:12,560 --> 04:37:17,600
Oh the poison's still like doing tick damage the poison's doing 50 tick damage

3402
04:37:19,920 --> 04:37:23,600
50 is gonna add up over time real quick holy crap

3403
04:37:24,560 --> 04:37:29,200
I think it is is this poison last the entire fight

3404
04:37:30,800 --> 04:37:38,560
If poison and rot together, I might be better put myself into poison and rot and then swap them back to bleed

3405
04:37:41,440 --> 04:37:45,280
Because it is going down face to face to

3406
04:37:46,080 --> 04:37:48,080
Oh

3407
04:37:50,080 --> 04:37:53,840
Shit delay. Yeah, sorry. I messed up a lot of them, but I knew I was doing

3408
04:37:56,240 --> 04:37:58,240
Another stagger

3409
04:38:02,480 --> 04:38:07,840
Please no, please no ASMR ice wolves. I'd appreciate it

3410
04:38:11,920 --> 04:38:13,920
Yeah, I knew it was still coming from me

3411
04:38:15,280 --> 04:38:17,280
I

3412
04:38:20,800 --> 04:38:22,800
Man doesn't make me scared when she gets close

3413
04:38:26,160 --> 04:38:28,160
Don't hold on

3414
04:38:28,480 --> 04:38:35,440
Dodge pause dodge too early, but it's okay. It's okay. Let him get up. Let him get up. Let him get up

3415
04:38:39,280 --> 04:38:44,560
No, I don't want to hear that uh jump jump jump. Oh, I missed it, but I think I can survive

3416
04:38:45,840 --> 04:38:48,340
Okay, okay, two of us have remained

3417
04:38:50,720 --> 04:38:55,280
She doesn't do the ice globe ASMR ice club attack again does she

3418
04:38:57,760 --> 04:39:04,720
Hold on hold on. I'm trying to take aggro. She's refusing to look at me. Ah

3419
04:39:08,400 --> 04:39:13,760
I'm trying to get bleed our aggro just to give you some breathing room

3420
04:39:15,280 --> 04:39:17,280
No

3421
04:39:19,360 --> 04:39:21,360
Seeing so

3422
04:39:22,560 --> 04:39:24,560
Oh my dear

3423
04:39:25,520 --> 04:39:28,160
I don't think I have enough time to even try and get my sword out

3424
04:39:29,280 --> 04:39:31,280
No

3425
04:39:32,160 --> 04:39:34,160
I want to I want to win with you guys

3426
04:39:34,960 --> 04:39:39,680
It's not the same winning on my eight on my own. I don't like it. I want to win with you guys

3427
04:39:40,400 --> 04:39:45,040
She caught me mid to drink. Why are you having a drink in the middle of a fight?

3428
04:39:47,520 --> 04:39:48,640
Uh

3429
04:39:48,640 --> 04:39:53,920
It's an attempt to end the fight. It seems you can only do it once. It's our it's her true ultimate. Okay

3430
04:39:55,280 --> 04:39:59,680
We are getting there. Sorry. We're getting so close like I legit have faith like I'm sorry if you're bored of this

3431
04:39:59,760 --> 04:40:01,760
I have so much faith

3432
04:40:01,840 --> 04:40:06,080
Um, so wrong though. You've not been in for this in a wee hot site

3433
04:40:06,800 --> 04:40:08,800
And

3434
04:40:09,200 --> 04:40:11,440
Can't read your name about f in time

3435
04:40:13,200 --> 04:40:15,360
Is that what you're saying because I take so long to come in

3436
04:40:16,640 --> 04:40:22,480
We're getting so close. No seriously. Um, oh for heel. Sorry. Sorry. I thought you meant you were like taking a

3437
04:40:22,560 --> 04:40:26,960
Swiggy your cola mid fight and I'm like right now. Now's when you're thirsty

3438
04:40:27,920 --> 04:40:29,920
Sorry, my apology

3439
04:40:30,400 --> 04:40:34,080
It's not boring. It's painful because I don't know how bad you feel

3440
04:40:34,400 --> 04:40:36,800
No, I'm I think we've got it

3441
04:40:37,360 --> 04:40:42,320
I want to go get the morning coconut after and then that's that's my reward for getting this the

3442
04:40:42,880 --> 04:40:44,880
getting this far

3443
04:40:44,880 --> 04:40:46,880
the morning coconut

3444
04:40:47,040 --> 04:40:49,040
my below

3445
04:40:49,040 --> 04:40:52,080
Is the other leafling gonna time out? I hope no

3446
04:40:54,080 --> 04:40:56,080
I'm having a swig in real life too. Yeah

3447
04:40:59,200 --> 04:41:01,200
Oh wait a minute

3448
04:41:02,160 --> 04:41:05,440
Any bleeding hearts a zero is t minus

3449
04:41:06,480 --> 04:41:09,680
one hour and 17 minutes to be exact

3450
04:41:20,560 --> 04:41:22,560
Are you ready?

3451
04:41:22,560 --> 04:41:24,560
Are you ready we go

3452
04:41:24,560 --> 04:41:27,920
We go we go we have prayed we have prayed I have faith I have faith

3453
04:41:28,800 --> 04:41:30,800
Anyone doing a prayer outside?

3454
04:41:32,160 --> 04:41:37,360
Okay, we've got a few prayers going off. Let's go. Oh, I'm traversing the midst of it awkwardly, but uh traversed it

3455
04:41:37,360 --> 04:41:41,280
Nonetheless through the heck of myself. Oh, they're there. I'm blind. I'm sorry

3456
04:41:42,560 --> 04:41:44,560
Oh, I should dodge that. Oh my god

3457
04:41:47,040 --> 04:41:49,040
Okay, let's try

3458
04:41:49,840 --> 04:41:54,720
What am I doing? Poison? Is she already poisoned or is that that's not rude to say

3459
04:42:01,200 --> 04:42:03,200
Oh

3460
04:42:10,720 --> 04:42:12,720
I saw that bleed

3461
04:42:24,240 --> 04:42:26,240
Okay

3462
04:42:26,640 --> 04:42:34,240
She's taking tick damage. Okay. She's got her to say so what I'll go back to poison. Can she have both?

3463
04:42:35,360 --> 04:42:38,800
Dodge and dodge. I did that far too early

3464
04:42:41,680 --> 04:42:44,960
Can I give her poison and to say is there any way to see it both?

3465
04:42:45,920 --> 04:42:47,920
No, they don't stack

3466
04:42:47,920 --> 04:42:53,360
Oh, what a silly game right hold the line. Hold the line reflins. You can do it. Hold on. Hold on mommy

04:43:13,920 --> 04:43:15,920
Oh my god, the rot's taking her down. No

The rot is ticking down. Oh shit. I'm not feeling well. Oh, no, I should have just jumped

Okay, I'm just missing everything that's fine. I didn't want to hit her anyway

3480
04:43:47,520 --> 04:43:49,520
I didn't want to hit her anyway

3481
04:43:51,920 --> 04:43:53,920

3494
04:44:46,480 --> 04:44:53,280
Think this endurance really put my maximum equipment up. I don't really think there's anything else I can do

04:44:54,080 --> 04:44:56,080

3500
04:45:14,880 --> 04:45:16,880

Okay, I'll just do

3508
04:45:43,840 --> 04:45:46,640
I don't think dexterity even changes anything for me. This is

All right, I don't I assume because it's a boss fight. I can't summon. Yeah, okay. I can't summon you to our boss area

3510
04:45:58,000 --> 04:46:00,000
Where are we hidden?

3511
04:46:00,400 --> 04:46:02,400
The story

3512
04:46:03,040 --> 04:46:05,040
Scardus altus

3513
04:46:08,960 --> 04:46:10,960
Okay

3514
04:46:10,960 --> 04:46:14,080
That scary fire guy's ahead. I'm very curious

3515
04:46:15,360 --> 04:46:17,360
Is there something to talk to?

3516
04:46:22,160 --> 04:46:26,880
Hello again, hi, did you meet my compatriot something quite the congregation

3517
04:46:27,600 --> 04:46:30,640
From places as far and wide as you can imagine

3518
04:46:31,280 --> 04:46:37,840
Doubtless it have all come to blows at first glance. Uh-huh. Were it not for the charm kindly micula put upon us

3519
04:46:38,720 --> 04:46:44,480
This is what allows us to serve together the work of a living god

3520
04:46:46,800 --> 04:46:48,800
This is alive

3521
04:46:52,320 --> 04:46:56,320
I'm very confused. I mean it's not too bad

3522
04:46:57,680 --> 04:46:59,680
Me the best win

3523
04:47:13,120 --> 04:47:15,120
The tarnished

3524
04:47:27,840 --> 04:47:29,840
Can I just execute this man right now?

3525
04:47:31,440 --> 04:47:33,440
I won't do it, but

3526
04:47:33,760 --> 04:47:38,880
Right, this is for adventuring. So this isn't I'll add it to the adventure list

3527
04:47:41,280 --> 04:47:43,280
Barret has an adventure

3528
04:47:46,080 --> 04:47:48,080
And then

3529
04:47:50,400 --> 04:47:53,920
Stronger both of you have an adventure with me

3530
04:47:54,880 --> 04:47:56,880
Okay, but that doesn't count

3531
04:47:59,920 --> 04:48:01,920
And then enemy we fling

3532
04:48:05,040 --> 04:48:11,520
They're wrongly you haven't been adventuring so you're in the adventure can't you go

3533
04:48:15,600 --> 04:48:19,520
Some of the outfits are pure drip. He's just stricken by grief

3534
04:48:20,160 --> 04:48:22,160
What to be a racist towards me?

3535
04:48:23,920 --> 04:48:25,920
I'm all

3536
04:48:39,120 --> 04:48:43,920
I'm getting people cosy and I put my blanket over me. I'm getting cuddly. What do we

3537
04:48:45,440 --> 04:48:50,000
I know weapons if I go cuddly. What do we with my wee friends? Oh, yeah

3538
04:48:50,960 --> 04:48:52,960
Oh

3539
04:48:53,120 --> 04:48:54,960
Let us see

3540
04:48:54,960 --> 04:48:57,520
Witch Prattling. Oh, we never got the morning one

3541
04:48:58,960 --> 04:49:05,920
Does anyone know the location of the morning prattle thing? I think we need to go get the morning one

3542
04:49:09,360 --> 04:49:10,400
Uh

3543
04:49:10,400 --> 04:49:18,000
We'll carry you to bed and tuck you in it's found in a dungeon, but you can't remember which one come uh come we

3544
04:49:18,960 --> 04:49:25,040
Right, we'll explore and then whoever posts where the prattle and morning thing is we'll go to it

3545
04:49:26,560 --> 04:49:31,520
Okay, let's head off. I don't know where we're going. We're going on in this or I'm about to follow you

3546
04:49:32,080 --> 04:49:34,080
Are we just going on an adventure? I don't know

3547
04:49:35,360 --> 04:49:37,360
No, go a little bit

3548
04:49:38,960 --> 04:49:40,960
Uh

3549
04:49:41,120 --> 04:49:43,120
When

3550
04:49:45,920 --> 04:49:51,520
What one do you want again the one that whimpers, but I think it's maybe like crying coconut

3551
04:49:52,560 --> 04:49:54,560
But it sounds like a whimper. It sounds like oh

3552
04:49:57,440 --> 04:50:03,200
Did I tell you this fun fact, you know in shivy's lore we're the man that's getting whipped. That's me

3553
04:50:03,760 --> 04:50:05,760
It's my voice

3554
04:50:06,560 --> 04:50:08,560
Uh, but toned down

3555
04:50:08,880 --> 04:50:15,600
Where are you going rifling get down from there? That's dangerous. You're not supposed to play

3556
04:50:16,320 --> 04:50:19,840
You're not supposed to play in the air rifling. Where are you going?

3557
04:50:20,960 --> 04:50:22,960
rifling come back

3558
04:50:22,960 --> 04:50:24,960
Rifling

3559
04:50:27,120 --> 04:50:29,120
Rifling come back

3560
04:50:30,160 --> 04:50:32,160
Where are you?

3561
04:50:32,160 --> 04:50:34,400
Oh, shit. I've got my weapon tree out. Hold on

3562
04:50:35,920 --> 04:50:39,840
Hold on and get my speed to a pulp. Hold on. I have enough eggs to tank this thing

3563
04:50:40,960 --> 04:50:42,960
Wow, hold on

3564
04:50:43,120 --> 04:50:45,120
Put the weapon on

3565
04:50:46,240 --> 04:50:48,560
No, but I can't put it on it won't let me put it on

3566
04:50:49,520 --> 04:50:55,280
Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Oh my god. I'm so sorry. Hold on everyone. Let me swap weapon right now. I don't know why

3567
04:50:56,800 --> 04:50:58,800
Hold on

3568
04:50:58,960 --> 04:51:03,440
Fucking dogs. Sorry. I'm needing this rifling to save me. I can't swap right now

3569
04:51:04,640 --> 04:51:08,560
Me bringing the fucking trouble to to the rifling. Holy crap. I'm so sorry

3570
04:51:08,880 --> 04:51:11,600
Why isn't it letting me take it out? Is it because I'm in combat?

3571
04:51:12,960 --> 04:51:15,760
E fucking hell. How hard is that game? Gee

3572
04:51:18,560 --> 04:51:20,560
Oh, are you okay? No, hold on

3573
04:51:23,440 --> 04:51:27,280
Okay, these guys have no poise these guys have no poise so you can just break them

3574
04:51:32,240 --> 04:51:38,160
Stuck in a cross literally am I going crazy? I'm pretty sure I selected a to swap and I didn't

3575
04:51:39,440 --> 04:51:41,440
Oh, hello

3576
04:51:41,680 --> 04:51:43,680

3577
04:51:43,680 --> 04:51:50,160
Crusade is such a satisfying word crusade. It's just a man. Can I burn?

3578
04:51:50,880 --> 04:51:52,880
Mmm. Call of mine

3579
04:51:53,040 --> 04:51:55,120
Why is it always done? It's not

3580
04:51:59,040 --> 04:52:01,040
Okay, we've got some more flesh of

04:52:13,440 --> 04:52:17,200
Oh, it's you you're healing or something. You have an aura about you

3585
04:52:21,120 --> 04:52:23,920
Crusading intensifies. Oh, okay, let's perch

3586
04:52:24,960 --> 04:52:26,960
We get healed by the magical storm

3587
04:52:27,440 --> 04:52:29,440
We should grab some more

3588
04:52:30,560 --> 04:52:34,560
Wait, the tiger has a little nose print. Look, he has a little symbol on his nose

3589
04:52:35,280 --> 04:52:37,280
Oh

3590
04:52:43,600 --> 04:52:45,600
Okay, are we ready? No, we're not

3591
04:52:49,760 --> 04:52:51,760
I can't be just can drop a healing stone

3592
04:52:53,120 --> 04:52:58,880
My beloved he says thank you. You're welcome. I think my beloved can also be you're welcome

3593
04:52:59,760 --> 04:53:04,160
Like the pleasure is all mine. Whoa. That was like a church. That's actually not decimated up there

3594
04:53:04,960 --> 04:53:06,960
How curious how rare

3595
04:53:08,480 --> 04:53:10,480
Hmm

3596
04:53:13,280 --> 04:53:16,240
Yes, the boys. Oh no, they're ready to attack

3597
04:53:18,160 --> 04:53:20,160
I'm so mad

3598
04:53:24,160 --> 04:53:27,120
This is getting I'm needing

3599
04:53:27,840 --> 04:53:30,800
Anything to bring the guards the guards are to be rang

3600
04:53:31,600 --> 04:53:33,280
How are the

3601
04:53:33,280 --> 04:53:35,600
How are the walking NPCs?

3602
04:53:36,400 --> 04:53:38,400
Other than the stalking

3603
04:53:38,880 --> 04:53:40,880
fucking attack

3604
04:53:41,280 --> 04:53:43,280
Jeez Louise

3605
04:53:45,200 --> 04:53:49,680
The walking NPCs are giving me such a tough time, right? We're avoiding everything

3606
04:53:50,000 --> 04:53:54,160
Especially that bam on the horse. Don't go near that bam on the horse. I'm not attacking them

3607
04:53:55,520 --> 04:53:57,680
Don't go near him. I'm looking sweat by him

3608
04:53:59,280 --> 04:54:01,280
Let's go around

3609
04:54:01,600 --> 04:54:06,080
I didn't have enough. I didn't have enough nothing for the church. Look like a school

3610
04:54:06,400 --> 04:54:10,480
Oh, is it like a magic school again? Like a rail car. Yeah

3611
04:54:11,760 --> 04:54:16,720
I don't even know what we're going to do against that fire giant. He's terrifying. Oh, we have a map

3612
04:54:17,840 --> 04:54:19,840
Oh piece candy

3613
04:54:21,680 --> 04:54:23,680
The map

3614
04:54:31,360 --> 04:54:35,440
I'm not yawning. I'm not yawning. What do you mean? I was perfectly well rested

3615
04:54:36,320 --> 04:54:39,200
Although this is wait, did you activate him?

3616
04:54:42,560 --> 04:54:44,560
He activated him

3617
04:54:47,200 --> 04:54:49,200
Oh, he's ready to fight

3618
04:54:49,440 --> 04:54:51,440
I think can we avoid him?

3619
04:54:52,240 --> 04:54:54,240
Hold me refling. I'm scared

3620
04:54:55,120 --> 04:55:00,320
Okay, let's just keep running past. How about that? Wait, where did he come from? I'm just running. Bye. Bye. I'm running

3621
04:55:00,400 --> 04:55:05,200
I don't care. Don't look back. Just keep going refling. Just keep going. Don't turn back. Follow the purple refling

3622
04:55:05,360 --> 04:55:08,880
Follow the purple light. You can do it. You can do it. We don't need to fight

3623
04:55:10,000 --> 04:55:12,000
Not that we can't anyway. I suck

3624
04:55:13,360 --> 04:55:15,360
Oh god, they're everywhere

3625
04:55:16,800 --> 04:55:18,560
Uh

3626
04:55:18,560 --> 04:55:22,800
That big fire guys are gonna aggro to us, right? Surely surely he's an aggro dude

3627
04:55:23,040 --> 04:55:28,000
Surely that big massive guy that I'm totally have no weaponry or armor for

3628
04:55:28,480 --> 04:55:31,520
Is going to turn around and like spit flame all over. Surely not

3629
04:55:31,520 --> 04:55:33,520
Oh

3630
04:55:34,400 --> 04:55:39,280
We don't see the enemies and the enemies don't see us. We keep our eyes close

3631
04:55:40,560 --> 04:55:46,560
We do not see we do not see we are safe. We are not overrun at all

3632
04:55:46,800 --> 04:55:48,800
Oh

3633
04:55:59,680 --> 04:56:06,320
Somewhere a great ruin has broken and so too has a powerful charm

3634
04:56:08,640 --> 04:56:11,280
What does that mean so

3635
04:56:13,120 --> 04:56:15,120
What does that mean

3636
04:56:17,280 --> 04:56:19,280
That charm has broken

3637
04:56:23,280 --> 04:56:26,320
It's new so there's literally no wiki stuff. Oh

3638
04:56:28,240 --> 04:56:30,240
Shadow keep

3639
04:56:31,440 --> 04:56:33,440
And there's a space

3640
04:56:34,400 --> 04:56:37,520
And you're gonna love oh, there's like a temple of dibella

3641
04:56:39,600 --> 04:56:41,600
Okay, is our refling here

3642
04:56:42,400 --> 04:56:46,960
Oh, no, is there no refling here at all? Wow the map goes so much bigger

3643
04:56:48,080 --> 04:56:50,080
Whoa, there's the tree

3644
04:56:50,880 --> 04:56:54,880
That looks like a looky look we can go to the bottom right and we can go top left

3645
04:56:55,040 --> 04:56:57,840
We have kind of discovered the diagonal of this map

3646
04:56:59,280 --> 04:57:01,280
Is there no

3647
04:57:02,640 --> 04:57:08,560
You can talk with the npcs at the grace to understand what's happening. Don't go. Are you saying don't go?

3648
04:57:08,800 --> 04:57:10,800
I

3649
04:57:11,280 --> 04:57:13,280
Don't know what that means. I mean don't go

3650
04:57:14,080 --> 04:57:16,080
Should I wait for a refling to come help?

3651
04:57:17,280 --> 04:57:20,320
Tea bag if that means wait for a refling to come help

3652
04:57:26,160 --> 04:57:28,640
Please no, don't go wait for another refling

3653
04:57:31,120 --> 04:57:33,120
Please help

3654
04:57:34,240 --> 04:57:37,680
Uh, is there any refling at all at this area?

3655
04:57:39,040 --> 04:57:43,600
Checking in from work. How's it going? We progress

3656
04:57:45,120 --> 04:57:49,440
We're waiting on another refling to spawn but I think we might have a bit of a problem on our hands

3657
04:57:49,760 --> 04:57:54,480
Where we're all coming at the same bit. I'm at shadow keep main gate

3658
04:57:55,600 --> 04:57:59,360
Oh, here we go. Everything's are helping. Is there anyone who's not had a chance to be in?

3659
04:58:00,480 --> 04:58:04,880
Oh, pineapple. You were the one that was healing me and then it went terribly wrong because you were healing me

3660
04:58:04,880 --> 04:58:08,080
And I did hardly any damage. We'll give you a shot again

3661
04:58:09,520 --> 04:58:14,880
Um, don't did you ink on me? Are you inking me right now?

3662
04:58:16,240 --> 04:58:19,280
Are you telling me a couple inch of this fish?

3663
04:58:21,360 --> 04:58:23,360
Are you telling me

3664
04:58:28,480 --> 04:58:32,000
Give me like 10 minutes to get home. I'ma carry you right through that shit

3665
04:58:32,960 --> 04:58:38,560
Okay, trumpet pineapple, holy holy architect. Thank you

3666
04:58:43,360 --> 04:58:47,520
Okay, uh, can I go in now?

3667
04:58:51,040 --> 04:58:53,040
Am I allowed to go in now?

3668
04:58:56,320 --> 04:58:58,320
Oh, no, he's committing some

3669
04:58:59,280 --> 04:59:06,160
It doesn't have to be this way refling you can just use the pearl finger. It doesn't have to be so dramatic

3670
04:59:07,440 --> 04:59:09,440
You're so dramatic refling

3671
04:59:12,480 --> 04:59:13,600
Oh

3672
04:59:13,600 --> 04:59:15,440
Oh, no, this can't be

3673
04:59:15,440 --> 04:59:22,640
Literally why why you just had to use the pearl finger. Oh, I got some runes for that even though I didn't do anything

3674
04:59:23,200 --> 04:59:27,520
Infinite rune glitch just get reflings to come in all the same and then commit Senpai

3675
04:59:28,640 --> 04:59:34,560
Okay, are we ready? Are we steady? I'm not sure you guys seem to be stuck behind the door

3676
04:59:36,080 --> 04:59:38,080
It's a rhino

3677
04:59:39,280 --> 04:59:41,280
Okay, big launch

3678
04:59:43,520 --> 04:59:50,480
Um, I'm trying to analyze the attack pattern. Can I melee him is the question

3679
04:59:58,720 --> 05:00:05,280
I'm learning. I'm learning. I got healed. I'm trying to learn

3680
05:00:10,080 --> 05:00:12,080
I'm out of stamina

3681
05:00:17,360 --> 05:00:19,360
Oh

3682
05:00:20,480 --> 05:00:22,480
Oh, no, he just like

3683
05:00:24,640 --> 05:00:27,440
He's a porcupine rhino dog

3684
05:00:29,280 --> 05:00:36,240
He's a porcupine. Yeah that fucking crossbow. Really no, I don't even want to touch him

3685
05:00:39,040 --> 05:00:44,160
I might have ammo. Hold on. Hold on. I'm very small brain

3686
05:00:52,160 --> 05:00:54,160
Ah put me down put me down

3687
05:00:58,640 --> 05:01:00,640
Oh

3688
05:01:10,480 --> 05:01:12,480
No, this can't be

3689
05:01:18,480 --> 05:01:24,640
I don't do even I don't even know if we have we can do this

3690
05:01:25,600 --> 05:01:27,600
I

3691
05:01:28,000 --> 05:01:33,840
Colossal porcupine. Is that his name half porcupine half rhino half dug

3692
05:01:34,640 --> 05:01:37,280
It's a porcupine. It's head to Potomac

3693
05:01:39,280 --> 05:01:42,240
It's not only a hip or a golden missile. Wow

3694
05:01:44,880 --> 05:01:46,880
Hmm

3695
05:01:48,000 --> 05:01:50,000
Mm-hmm

3696
05:01:50,000 --> 05:01:53,840
Um not very confident

3697
05:01:55,440 --> 05:01:58,240
But you know what sometimes it's okay to say you're not confident

3698
05:01:59,040 --> 05:02:01,680
Right. No, I'm you didn't get a chance to do that one

3699
05:02:03,040 --> 05:02:05,040
I did just have you in

3700
05:02:06,160 --> 05:02:10,640
You guys really are quite far ahead if you're able to help me this far into the dlc

3701
05:02:12,000 --> 05:02:15,120
You haven't finished is anyone finished the dlc?

3702
05:02:15,520 --> 05:02:17,120
I

3703
05:02:17,120 --> 05:02:20,320
Don't know if you set the grace. You can pull more balls out of my storage

3704
05:02:22,400 --> 05:02:29,360
Because people gave you too many other in store. Actually his name is golden has a lot of potomace, but porcupine otomace is an interesting one

3705
05:02:31,360 --> 05:02:35,440
I had fun warning strontia that I'm going boss. Are you ready?

3706
05:02:36,560 --> 05:02:43,440
My lady. My sir. Mmm. My sir. Mmm. Are you ready?

3707
05:02:44,080 --> 05:02:47,200
Are you stay? I'm gonna wait till like oh, he's dropping me. So

3708
05:02:49,360 --> 05:02:51,360
Oh

3709
05:02:58,960 --> 05:03:02,240
Wait, what how is that crossbow better than a plus nine?

3710
05:03:05,280 --> 05:03:08,400
Huh or is it because it's spread that's why

3711
05:03:10,240 --> 05:03:12,240
Curious, okay

3712
05:03:14,080 --> 05:03:18,160
Accusations aren't true. Are you ready? Are you steady?

3713
05:03:21,280 --> 05:03:25,040
Okay, can I get a free hit and at the start let's find out

3714
05:03:29,200 --> 05:03:31,200
Instantly

3715
05:03:32,400 --> 05:03:38,640
Holy crap because he's such a long boy as well. He can go so far

3716
05:03:39,440 --> 05:03:41,440
I

3717
05:03:42,000 --> 05:03:44,000
Don't know right. We'll do poison damage first

3718
05:03:46,000 --> 05:03:51,680
Although he already looks like he's infected. So I see poisoning just to be honest

3719
05:03:52,560 --> 05:03:57,440
Oh my gosh. I'm not even successfully dodging a single thing from him

3720
05:03:59,440 --> 05:04:01,440
Oh

3721
05:04:08,720 --> 05:04:10,720
I don't

3722
05:04:12,000 --> 05:04:20,320
Oh, that's so beautiful. So that part isn't that was my freaking final column. I'm gonna heal or I'm down and out

3723
05:04:21,840 --> 05:04:27,200
Okay, we're fine. We're fine. I'm gonna take my wonders for last because she probably actually did something with it

3724
05:04:28,400 --> 05:04:30,400
I still don't know what it actually does

3725
05:04:33,440 --> 05:04:35,680
Okay, I don't think you take poison damage

3726
05:04:36,640 --> 05:04:38,640
I've been whacking them for a bit now

3727
05:04:54,400 --> 05:04:58,080
I like the warning that he's charging up. I don't like that

3728
05:04:59,840 --> 05:05:01,840
Oh

3729
05:05:02,640 --> 05:05:08,240
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think we might have it. Oh, I say as the reefling gets chopped to pieces

3730
05:05:11,040 --> 05:05:13,040
Okay, okay

3731
05:05:14,880 --> 05:05:17,520
Please help is the closest part I could find

3732
05:05:18,800 --> 05:05:20,800
This area is torture. Do we need to go by?

3733
05:05:22,560 --> 05:05:25,040
We got 50 percent on the second attempt

3734
05:05:25,120 --> 05:05:27,920
I'll see if we can get below 75 percent

3735
05:05:28,400 --> 05:05:34,080
Then I think we might be on to something who's not had a thrombler. You've not had a shot on this ball

3736
05:05:35,200 --> 05:05:38,080
About f in time. You've not had a shot on this ball side there

3737
05:05:43,040 --> 05:05:45,040
Is this what this is

3738
05:05:46,320 --> 05:05:51,120
Uh, help me so to only if I had a friend of her buddy

3739
05:05:53,760 --> 05:05:55,760
Friends oh

3740
05:05:56,640 --> 05:05:58,800
That was so loud for no reason

3741
05:06:00,000 --> 05:06:04,320
Okay, one managed to make it in hopefully no DC. I guess it was easy

3742
05:06:06,160 --> 05:06:09,520
Oh, it's about time. I thought it was about f in time

3743
05:06:11,200 --> 05:06:13,200
Is that my swear word?

3744
05:06:15,360 --> 05:06:19,200
I didn't know Sam was a swear word. Okay kiss and kiss

3745
05:06:20,560 --> 05:06:22,320
Are you ready?

3746
05:06:22,320 --> 05:06:24,320
Are you starting?

3747
05:06:24,880 --> 05:06:26,880
Adrenaline is pumping

3748
05:06:27,840 --> 05:06:29,840
Adrenaline is pumping

3749
05:06:31,760 --> 05:06:33,760
Killing machine

3750
05:06:35,520 --> 05:06:38,560
Over can you click on to the enemy for once?

3751
05:06:41,840 --> 05:06:43,840
We just go for bleeds

3752
05:06:44,080 --> 05:06:46,560
I feel like that man did not get any

3753
05:06:47,840 --> 05:06:49,280
I'll do bleeds

3754
05:06:49,280 --> 05:06:56,320
The poison I think he's poisoned in this one because of his he's already got like something going on on his wee back

3755
05:07:02,640 --> 05:07:04,640
Why is he going for me?

3756
05:07:08,800 --> 05:07:10,800
Oh

3757
05:07:11,760 --> 05:07:13,760
I

3758
05:07:18,000 --> 05:07:22,720
Why are you going for me? I'm literally doing the weakest damage on you. I'm not being funny

3759
05:07:24,080 --> 05:07:30,640
I literally what a hundred pair of freaking bull relaxed. I'm really not doing that much here. Oh some go crisp

3760
05:07:34,240 --> 05:07:37,520
Oh that bleeds that was a bleed

3761
05:07:37,520 --> 05:07:39,520
Okay

3762
05:07:41,680 --> 05:07:45,600
Less than 50. Uh, I'm ready to just go all in on bleep. Holy crap

3763
05:07:48,080 --> 05:07:52,640
This is insane. I think everyone just needs to spec bleep

3764
05:08:03,840 --> 05:08:06,880
Uh, I don't want to fuck up not to be honest

3765
05:08:08,080 --> 05:08:10,080
I

3766
05:08:12,880 --> 05:08:14,880
I'm trying

3767
05:08:15,840 --> 05:08:20,320
If I could get a bleed oh that would be grand

3768
05:08:25,440 --> 05:08:27,940
Don't get bored refling don't get bored

3769
05:08:28,660 --> 05:08:30,660
I

3770
05:08:34,980 --> 05:08:38,580
Need to fill hell because if he does that really fully into me

3771
05:08:45,300 --> 05:08:54,500
I'm fucking corner I fucking can't get out I can't get out I fast thankfully I'm allowed to get out

3772
05:08:58,660 --> 05:09:00,660
Oh

3773
05:09:04,100 --> 05:09:06,100
Too early far too early

3774
05:09:10,900 --> 05:09:16,580
I'm low. I'm low on fucking heels. I've got one more health. I just need to pop it if he does that really fully into me

3775
05:09:16,580 --> 05:09:18,580
I'm gone

3776
05:09:28,900 --> 05:09:31,700
No, I rolled into his freaking gob

3777
05:09:32,820 --> 05:09:36,260
Okay, we 100% have this look at that. That's less than 10%

3778
05:09:37,460 --> 05:09:39,300
100% have it

3779
05:09:39,300 --> 05:09:42,660
I literally needed one more bleed to pop off that would have been a

3780
05:09:43,300 --> 05:09:46,740
Lesson enemy is immune to bleed like bleed is super

3781
05:09:47,300 --> 05:09:51,300
Powerful it's what made the black tank wife is that the powerful woman

3782
05:09:52,260 --> 05:09:53,300
I

3783
05:09:53,300 --> 05:09:59,220
We can 100% do it. People just these same things over there much of misinformation. Oh about the game

3784
05:10:00,180 --> 05:10:02,180
Set you've not had a shot

3785
05:10:07,060 --> 05:10:08,900
Uh

3786
05:10:08,900 --> 05:10:11,540
Zanfil airborne walk I've never

3787
05:10:13,380 --> 05:10:15,380
You're definitely new

3788
05:10:15,780 --> 05:10:18,260
How are you naked and in the dlc section?

3789
05:10:21,780 --> 05:10:27,300
Whoever about about time is insane

3790
05:10:29,380 --> 05:10:32,580
You want me to use uh, I just don't want to waste on long bullets

3791
05:10:36,100 --> 05:10:38,580
Maybe if I just use it on the normal

3792
05:10:42,740 --> 05:10:44,900
Right, I'll help I'll use it on normal

3793
05:10:45,700 --> 05:10:47,700
Oh

3794
05:10:49,300 --> 05:10:52,580
I'll try the spread on them. I'm not gonna have any effect. Oh

3795
05:10:53,860 --> 05:10:56,820
Special delivery. What do you need to make?

3796
05:10:57,620 --> 05:11:01,700
I should maybe think about making myself. I forgot to get more

3797
05:11:04,180 --> 05:11:06,180
Uh, are we ready?

3798
05:11:08,980 --> 05:11:10,980
Oh, we got the health as well ready

3799
05:11:14,980 --> 05:11:28,820
Okay, okay, if you hold your nerve you can actually get over that. It's just a bit nerve-racking seeing the open mouth of your enemy

3800
05:11:32,740 --> 05:11:34,740
I only do 300

3801
05:11:34,740 --> 05:11:36,740
Uh

3802
05:11:43,460 --> 05:11:45,460
There's a lot going on right now

3803
05:11:51,060 --> 05:11:55,700
There's a lot going on right now. Oh someone got uh, oh my

3804
05:11:59,380 --> 05:12:01,380
Honest mistake

Okay, holy what? Oh no one's down. Every fling is down

3806
05:12:15,300 --> 05:12:18,740

3807
05:12:20,340 --> 05:12:22,840

3812
05:12:53,940 --> 05:12:55,940

3817
05:13:17,940 --> 05:13:21,700
Uh, phoenix, did you get to explore with me yet? No you didn't

3818
05:13:26,660 --> 05:13:28,660
Okay, we're exploring

3819
05:13:30,260 --> 05:13:36,020
Okay, whoever said you won't be shuggling after killing that girl. They actually weren't kidding

3820
05:13:40,100 --> 05:13:42,100
Oh, no if the summons are working

3821
05:13:44,740 --> 05:13:46,740
Oh, no the summons are broken

3822
05:13:47,540 --> 05:13:55,700
Hydration check get some water on you from any bleeding heart is there in t-minus 4.40 50 minutes

3823
05:13:56,180 --> 05:13:58,180
Hmm

3824
05:13:59,700 --> 05:14:04,100
I think that we should make time out. Can you take any more for less?

3825
05:14:10,500 --> 05:14:15,460
Uh, I can't even interact I've like pinged out

3826
05:14:16,900 --> 05:14:21,460
We have broken the server the unable to summon. Okay. I'll take any more for this because you didn't finish the game

3827
05:14:21,860 --> 05:14:29,460
I don't know why sometimes this sometimes that sometimes are maybe good sometimes or maybe she uh, you have not explored with me

3828
05:14:30,740 --> 05:14:32,100
If your connection will allow it

3829
05:14:32,100 --> 05:14:38,820
Maybe I should wait until you guys get in the lobby and write your name down because this entire sheet just has so much like unwritten

3830
05:14:40,260 --> 05:14:46,660
Alessandro, you did explore with me pineapple. Did you explore with me at all? I don't think you've explored with me at all pineapple

3831
05:14:47,540 --> 05:14:49,540
Oh

3832
05:14:51,140 --> 05:14:56,100
Is there enemy refling any enemies got a lot of enemies

3833
05:14:58,180 --> 05:15:00,180
I've got into the boss room

3834
05:15:00,420 --> 05:15:04,420
Go into the boss room and take a right the door was broke. The door's closed

3835
05:15:05,300 --> 05:15:06,740
Phil's closed

3836
05:15:06,740 --> 05:15:10,820
Unless I mean not right. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I got it. I got it. Any enemy refling

3837
05:15:12,020 --> 05:15:13,220
Any

3838
05:15:13,220 --> 05:15:15,220
arrivals

3839
05:15:15,700 --> 05:15:21,060
Oh, let me get my weapon out actually. I do not want to use a crossbow unless I'm actually in a fight like that

3840
05:15:25,380 --> 05:15:32,260
There is an enemy refling is it gonna be you've not explored with me and you have like for longest name ever

3841
05:15:38,740 --> 05:15:40,740
I'm excited to play um

3842
05:15:41,700 --> 05:15:47,220
The binding of eyes like I've been starting to plan my shorter streams when my dad gets here

3843
05:15:47,540 --> 05:15:49,940
He gave me the dates of him getting here

3844
05:15:50,580 --> 05:15:56,420
And I have to admit it is so weird of the concept of like cutting up a game

3845
05:15:56,820 --> 05:15:59,460
Like if a game is eight hours or less

3846
05:16:00,260 --> 05:16:02,260
It's really bizarre

3847
05:16:04,580 --> 05:16:06,580
Wait what

3848
05:16:07,860 --> 05:16:09,860
Huh

3849
05:16:10,820 --> 05:16:13,460
Did I miss something wait are we doing this fight again?

3850
05:16:17,940 --> 05:16:19,940
Huh

3851
05:16:22,260 --> 05:16:24,260
Did I miss something

3852
05:16:25,140 --> 05:16:33,140

3853
05:16:33,140 --> 05:16:35,700

3854
05:16:36,580 --> 05:16:39,540
I'm so sorry reflin. I had no idea. I apologize

3855
05:16:41,700 --> 05:16:47,380
Hey, I'm gonna do Eden runs. Why why cruel wall? I know

3856
05:16:48,420 --> 05:16:50,420
I left it with a little present

3857
05:16:51,620 --> 05:16:53,620
Where did I miss it?

3858
05:16:54,740 --> 05:16:59,140
You left me a little doofy you left me a bomb. Oh no, Eden. Sorry. It's not a bomb

3859
05:17:04,020 --> 05:17:06,020
Should I

3860
05:17:06,260 --> 05:17:08,820
Should I pop them? I think I'll pop everything

3861
05:17:09,140 --> 05:17:14,420
And then I'll upgrade what I can't oh my god

3862
05:17:17,140 --> 05:17:19,140
What's this one do

3863
05:17:20,660 --> 05:17:22,100
Bruh

3864
05:17:22,100 --> 05:17:26,580
Is that everything you guys really oh my god, don't mind if I do

3865
05:17:27,780 --> 05:17:29,780
Don't mind the bad news

3866
05:17:30,980 --> 05:17:32,980
For you you're you're seen

3867
05:17:32,980 --> 05:17:34,980
Oh

3868
05:17:36,500 --> 05:17:40,500
Just a couple just a few weird more runes. Oh nothing more

3869
05:17:40,660 --> 05:17:46,820
I'm like how on earth are you that level after like less than 48 hours? No less than 24 hours of game time

3870
05:17:47,940 --> 05:17:49,940
Actually like actual in game time

3871
05:17:52,100 --> 05:17:54,100
I think the system tells you

3872
05:17:55,140 --> 05:18:01,460
Yeah, fond of law 15 hours in game time level 193 feels good man

3873
05:18:03,780 --> 05:18:06,180
Um, right, what was that a new one?

3874
05:18:06,980 --> 05:18:08,980
Yeah, you

3875
05:18:10,660 --> 05:18:12,660
Just a small little five million

3876
05:18:21,860 --> 05:18:27,060
Okay, that's everything I can do right now. Let's see what we can do with it. Um

3877
05:18:28,100 --> 05:18:31,460
Is there a point and putting anything

3878
05:18:32,420 --> 05:18:37,700
Uh, it is soft cap. That's like for what to gain 99

3879
05:18:38,580 --> 05:18:40,580
HP

3880
05:18:40,820 --> 05:18:41,940
and

3881
05:18:41,940 --> 05:18:43,620
fire

3882
05:18:43,620 --> 05:18:47,780
Resistance up to twit is terrible. That's maybe worth it

3883
05:18:49,060 --> 05:18:51,380
Um, the cap is 80

3884
05:18:52,820 --> 05:18:58,020
Check the shadow tree blessing as well like I was just gonna shove it all into endurance, to be honest

3885
05:18:58,020 --> 05:19:00,020
Um

3886
05:19:00,900 --> 05:19:02,900
Dexterity for crossbow hits

3887
05:19:02,900 --> 05:19:04,900
Okay

3888
05:19:06,100 --> 05:19:10,020
I didn't know the crossbow works like that. There's 40 and 50 and

3889
05:19:11,300 --> 05:19:12,980
more few more

3890
05:19:12,980 --> 05:19:16,180
I mean the HP actually gives me a weaver resistance

3891
05:19:16,900 --> 05:19:18,900
immunity and robust

3892
05:19:20,020 --> 05:19:22,020
Not to be confused with

3893
05:19:22,900 --> 05:19:26,820
I I do apologize if I'm like completely wasting souls and stuff

3894
05:19:27,300 --> 05:19:33,300
I'm sorry. I just like playing the game with you. Is that so hard? I don't want the super amazing

3895
05:19:33,940 --> 05:19:35,940
freaking thing

3896
05:19:36,740 --> 05:19:38,740
I want I want to just do

3897
05:19:40,260 --> 05:19:46,340
Arcane is best for bleeding stats though though our trap is a even self just like so you get the ammunition

3898
05:19:49,460 --> 05:19:51,700
Obviously, please you're here. How are you here?

3899
05:19:53,140 --> 05:19:55,140
Uh, okay, hold on

3900
05:19:56,100 --> 05:19:59,220
Uh, well, let's see if I can get those original ones like this

3901
05:20:02,740 --> 05:20:06,020
I've got your name on the explore list. Did I actually see you?

3902
05:20:08,180 --> 05:20:10,180
Where are you?

3903
05:20:10,740 --> 05:20:15,380
Right, wait, and you get the good ones in first. Mage hasn't explored with me

3904
05:20:17,140 --> 05:20:19,620
Pineapple didn't explore and then enemy we've been

3905
05:20:21,860 --> 05:20:23,860
And then okay, okay

3906
05:20:25,700 --> 05:20:27,700
Oh

3907
05:20:30,020 --> 05:20:35,540
Oh my god, but right now it's just getting more cryptic and as it tangles on oh wait someone didn't come in

3908
05:20:39,220 --> 05:20:41,220
Right pineapple did make it and

3909
05:20:46,420 --> 05:20:48,420
We're doing it. Thank you

3910
05:20:50,660 --> 05:20:52,660
I don't think it's someone

3911
05:20:53,220 --> 05:20:55,780
I was the one that has to leave

3912
05:20:57,140 --> 05:20:59,780
Oh, did you wait? I've not scored it your name. Hold on

3913
05:21:00,340 --> 05:21:02,340
score out

3914
05:21:07,860 --> 05:21:14,100
Are you don't turn into a candlestick stop it stop being a role-playing as a candlestick right now

3915
05:21:14,660 --> 05:21:15,940
You want to know?

3916
05:21:15,940 --> 05:21:21,780
Actually, I watched a really cursed video about candle someone using a candle. No, don't you become a candlestick as well

3917
05:21:22,660 --> 05:21:24,660
Right, what's he saying to us?

3918
05:21:25,060 --> 05:21:28,900
He says no such a thing is utterly inconceivable

3919
05:21:29,700 --> 05:21:31,700
We have not been abandoned

3920
05:21:31,780 --> 05:21:37,300
Mithmer is the son of queen mariaq. Her grace would never abandon her own flesh and blood

3921
05:21:40,180 --> 05:21:43,140
You know the guy that one shots that boss

3922
05:21:44,660 --> 05:21:46,660
Is he like a big soul player?

3923
05:21:48,260 --> 05:21:50,260
I was gonna say are they just gonna leave us alone?

3924
05:21:53,620 --> 05:22:00,500
Right don't fall off the map for these bamboos. Careful enemy replaying. We don't want to actually whack you

3925
05:22:04,740 --> 05:22:09,780
Wait whoa, what you flipped my camera around

3926
05:22:14,820 --> 05:22:19,380
You have a nice you just moved there. What way? Oh, he's got torch. He knows to go this way

3927
05:22:19,780 --> 05:22:24,020
Wait, there's a little fight. Wait. There's a fight going on. We must save refling

3928
05:22:24,660 --> 05:22:26,660
Refling it's okay

3929
05:22:26,820 --> 05:22:28,820
I'll save you. I'll save you

3930
05:22:29,620 --> 05:22:31,620
There see look all that work is

3931
05:22:33,380 --> 05:22:36,020
Wait, you're going up. We went up or are we doing that?

3932
05:22:36,820 --> 05:22:39,380
I mean we can always explore it's not like we're in a major rush

3933
05:22:40,260 --> 05:22:42,260
I mean I

3934
05:22:44,900 --> 05:22:46,900

3950
05:23:57,060 --> 05:24:01,460
Because I am a wee bit of the spring solar just a slight bit of it. But thankfully

3951
05:24:02,420 --> 05:24:04,260
All my jobs are

3952
05:24:04,260 --> 05:24:08,580
Getting less and less and I'm just gonna be a full-time streamer that gets to do the fun stuff

3953
05:24:09,380 --> 05:24:12,580
Um, and I don't have to plan a billion different things

3954
05:24:13,300 --> 05:24:19,060
I love it. I love losing my job and just getting one job and keeping it. You're the entire news

3955
05:24:21,700 --> 05:24:23,700
What in one episode

3956
05:24:24,740 --> 05:24:29,380
I did a veal or exposing stream which was really fun because I think people were like

3957
05:24:30,340 --> 05:24:34,260
How is it possible? And I got to like be like, um

3958
05:24:35,140 --> 05:24:38,500
Actually the reason why any of this is even possible

3959
05:24:39,380 --> 05:24:41,380
Is because uh, there's no

3960
05:24:41,540 --> 05:24:48,420
Fucking stop from the company. It's self-owned. It's been seated. There's no debt and also, uh, corporate grief bad

3961
05:24:48,500 --> 05:24:51,300
Like, um, actually like I was so into that line

3962
05:24:51,940 --> 05:24:54,580
Is this a back short door a shortcut door?

3963
05:24:55,460 --> 05:24:58,100
To the right. I think this might have been the shortcut door

3964
05:24:59,060 --> 05:25:01,060
Okay, that way wait

3965
05:25:06,900 --> 05:25:08,100
Huh?

3966
05:25:08,100 --> 05:25:09,780
I mean

3967
05:25:09,780 --> 05:25:14,420
Right, we've unlocked the shortcut. It must just be two different sections. We unlock the shortcut. It's fine. We're fine

3968
05:25:14,900 --> 05:25:20,260
Strongly going over through capitalism using her agency. Wait, what do you mean that?

3969
05:25:21,540 --> 05:25:26,740
That 60 percent of the housing market is owned by one company. What if we

3970
05:25:27,380 --> 05:25:32,340
What if we hear me out? What hear me out. Hear me out. Hear me out. Bear with me. Bear with me. I see he's in the room

3971
05:25:32,900 --> 05:25:34,500
What if we do that?

3972
05:25:34,500 --> 05:25:40,500
But then we don't we don't do the bad thing and artificially raise prices so people can actually just exist

3973
05:25:40,580 --> 05:25:44,580
Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. We can't be saying these things out live. We're gonna get in trouble

3974
05:25:45,780 --> 05:25:48,180
What if we become the billion dollar company?

3975
05:25:49,060 --> 05:25:51,060
so we

3976
05:25:51,380 --> 05:25:52,820
Can

3977
05:25:52,820 --> 05:25:57,060
You know make sure the world doesn't artificially inflate because it's not real inflation

3978
05:25:57,540 --> 05:26:03,460
That's the kicker. But anyway enough of the tinfoil hat. We need to we need to be respectful. We're all about the respect

3979
05:26:05,300 --> 05:26:07,300
She came from the scottish vlog

3980
05:26:07,940 --> 05:26:10,420
What do you mean this person is for the people? It reaches

3981
05:26:11,780 --> 05:26:13,700
months

3982
05:26:13,700 --> 05:26:17,780
Oh, what's going on here? Oh, oh no poison spores poison spores

3983
05:26:18,580 --> 05:26:21,700
Careful poison. Oh gosh, there's so many rooms here

3984
05:26:22,580 --> 05:26:24,580
What is this?

3985
05:26:24,980 --> 05:26:28,020
Wait, that looks like the antelope I killed in my mother life

3986
05:26:29,700 --> 05:26:31,700
Wait a minute let her speak

3987
05:26:34,100 --> 05:26:40,420
Did you know that the ceo fatso is a person did you know that the average person has a name in it? I stop replaying

3988
05:26:41,380 --> 05:26:43,380

3989
05:26:43,780 --> 05:26:47,460
I'm gonna have views gone too far at the rate. I do my rent honestly

3990
05:26:48,660 --> 05:26:53,620
You don't need to protect the library from us. We're good. We are good explorers

3991
05:26:54,740 --> 05:26:56,740
We're not bad

3992
05:26:59,060 --> 05:27:00,660
Um

3993
05:27:00,660 --> 05:27:02,660
What other good feature bring you?

3994
05:27:03,540 --> 05:27:09,140
Yumi plus has five members. But Amy recently debuted

3995
05:27:09,860 --> 05:27:11,860
This is like feel good stuff

3996

And she's already broke a thousand subscribers, which is fantastic

3997

If I'm not mistaken, all of you me plus are just about to break a thousand subscribers, which is great news

3999
05:27:25,700 --> 05:27:28,420
Uh, I'm really happy for them. I'm so glad

4000
05:27:29,460 --> 05:27:33,780
They're very hard-working beings. Please don't attack me. Please don't attack me

Stop it. Am I I don't think I have much magic

4004
05:27:50,260 --> 05:27:54,980
I see something it's glowing. It's healing. That's glowing

4005
05:28:00,980 --> 05:28:05,060
How dangerous is this area? It's like never ending my goodness

4006
05:28:06,020 --> 05:28:08,020
Every corner has like something new

4007
05:28:08,980 --> 05:28:14,900
What do you mean this DLC is actually worth it and it's like a whole new expansion and not just a cash grab

4008
05:28:15,300 --> 05:28:20,500
Hold on a minute. Did software? No form soft some for

05:28:24,340 --> 05:28:26,340

05:28:33,620 --> 05:28:36,740
Stranny, what's your secret to being so perfect? What is in your honor?

4014
05:28:38,340 --> 05:28:42,180
Nothing I'll humble you like working in a care home as well or working

4015
05:28:43,220 --> 05:28:46,980
On a public sector job. I see is my voice is about to start cracking. Oh

4016
05:28:48,260 --> 05:28:49,860
Uh

4017
05:28:49,860 --> 05:28:54,260
Oh, oh, okay. No, no, it's fine. The fire didn't do too much

4018
05:28:56,100 --> 05:28:59,220
Oh, no, they have high points. Oh, really? No, really? No

4019

I'm gonna run back and call in reinforcements. Uh

4033
05:30:01,780 --> 05:30:05,780
I should have come back up refling what I do. Did I go back up? Wait, can I climb this?

4034
05:30:05,940 --> 05:30:10,900
Wait, I can just climb this. Hold on. Hold on refling. Oh, it's not lost. Oh, it's not lost. I'm just pepega

Wait, oh, no, maybe all is lost. Hold on

4036
05:30:19,300 --> 05:30:21,300
Oh, that scared me. Oh, that scared me

4037
05:30:21,540 --> 05:30:23,540
Oh

4038
05:30:23,780 --> 05:30:30,020
Reflings reflings. Oh, where's the crypt? Not this way is back this way. Sorry. There's a bad man

4039
05:30:30,340 --> 05:30:34,980
There's a bad man and he gave me such a scare. Oh, did you see the way he was lurking?

4040
05:30:35,700 --> 05:30:39,460
Oh, no, I can't handle that getting right now. Oh my god

4041
05:30:40,740 --> 05:30:42,980
Oh my god, I can't handle that

4042
05:30:44,100 --> 05:30:45,940
Oh

4043
05:30:45,940 --> 05:30:48,580
Did you see the way that guy was lurking?

4044
05:30:49,540 --> 05:30:52,500
Sorry, I'm trying to do the math in my head who's being here and who's not

4045
05:30:53,460 --> 05:30:59,700
Oh my god, did you see how menacing that was when he was coming around the corner like yeah, I'm coming to get you

4046
05:30:59,780 --> 05:31:01,780
I know you're alone

4047
05:31:06,260 --> 05:31:08,260
Oh my god

4048
05:31:08,340 --> 05:31:16,020
For from soft. Okay. It's called from soft. That made it. He was ropling as a refling lurker

4049
05:31:16,340 --> 05:31:21,700
That was horrifying. Wait, hold on. We item over here. Don't mind if I do the tv

4050
05:31:23,140 --> 05:31:28,580
Fireproof pickle. Okay. We're ready to go again. There is a red guy lurking around

4051
05:31:29,220 --> 05:31:34,980
I don't know where he is, but he's somewhere ready. It hurt you. Okay. Okay. We need to go all the way back, but that's okay

4052
05:31:35,620 --> 05:31:37,620
Uh, right. We went this way

4053
05:31:38,260 --> 05:31:39,460
I'll let you go first

4054
05:31:39,460 --> 05:31:42,020
Reflings so you can scout out if he's lurking

4055
05:31:42,580 --> 05:31:48,420
But he is there. Do not be filled. Reflings. There's a man in a red cloak and he's ready to take us

4056
05:31:50,740 --> 05:31:56,980
He's ready to take you from me and take us on just be careful. Okay

4057
05:31:59,140 --> 05:32:01,140
Careful

4058
05:32:01,540 --> 05:32:03,540
Easy

4059
05:32:04,260 --> 05:32:09,620
Is there I don't know where he is. He seems to have gone. Oh wait, and then we need to do the jump over here

4060
05:32:12,980 --> 05:32:14,980
Okay

4061
05:32:15,540 --> 05:32:19,060
Are we doing to the jump this time? Oh, are you just taking me back for safety?

4062
05:32:19,940 --> 05:32:21,940
Just trying to hold me going

4063
05:32:29,540 --> 05:32:32,100
Uh, oh that's not good

4064
05:32:33,300 --> 05:32:39,860
That's absolutely terrible. I just took a massive ball to the base doing that. Um, my apologies, what?

4065
05:32:42,260 --> 05:32:46,020
Oh, wait, I have a healing effect on me. I don't need to do that. You know what you'll be doing

4066
05:32:46,100 --> 05:32:48,100
Uh, like it literally gives you oh

4067
05:32:48,660 --> 05:32:50,660
There's like what the heck?

4068
05:32:51,460 --> 05:32:53,460
Oh

4069
05:32:53,460 --> 05:32:55,460
Wait, you need help

4070
05:32:56,420 --> 05:32:58,420
Ah, I missed

4071
05:32:59,060 --> 05:33:03,220
I missed but all that matters is I showed up. Okay. Sometimes all that matters is you show up and help

4072
05:33:04,660 --> 05:33:06,660
Uh, okay. We're going on the feet

4073
05:33:07,940 --> 05:33:09,940
Giant test

4074
05:33:10,900 --> 05:33:16,420
That squeak kills my soul. Well, because I'm so terrified to do anything without you

4075
05:33:18,820 --> 05:33:25,060
Literally me as soon as I saw that red guy don't even know where he is. He's probably lurking down there. Where is he?

4076
05:33:25,300 --> 05:33:27,300
I might be able to spot him from here

4077
05:33:29,300 --> 05:33:32,260
But actually lurking in the shadows can scare me

4078
05:33:34,740 --> 05:33:36,740
Uh, I think jump on that

4079
05:33:40,660 --> 05:33:46,260
He's like, did you just do what I think he did? I did the same. I did the same

4080
05:33:50,420 --> 05:33:54,180
He's like mother like refling

4081
05:33:57,700 --> 05:34:01,540
Okay, let's try that again. Let's try that again. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute

4082
05:34:02,740 --> 05:34:06,580
Oh, is everything gonna respawn now? I mean you start like attacking everything again

4083
05:34:07,540 --> 05:34:09,540
You tell me

4084
05:34:10,660 --> 05:34:13,700
Ah like mother like son

4085
05:34:14,900 --> 05:34:16,900
Like momay like refling

4086
05:34:21,620 --> 05:34:28,340
You were at the next grace. Why I'm dumb. Okay. Was that where the next grace was right over there?

4087
05:34:29,460 --> 05:34:31,860
I didn't even saw it. I was supposed to try to jump

4088
05:34:32,740 --> 05:34:34,740
Jump for joy

4089
05:34:35,220 --> 05:34:40,580
Okay, we have who is with us norm. Were you with us last time? Oh, can you remember?

4090
05:34:41,700 --> 05:34:45,380
Oh, we know I was supposed to bring in a good refling first

4091
05:34:46,500 --> 05:34:50,340
I'm so sorry if I double bring someone in my little brain's not working anymore

4092
05:34:51,620 --> 05:34:58,740
As you can see by my uh spectacular acrobatics and get myself erect on him. Wait

4093
05:34:59,700 --> 05:35:05,620
How are you supposed to get that item on his heat? It's on the bottom of his head

4094
05:35:05,940 --> 05:35:08,740
How are you supposed to get that item up there? Do you see it?

4095
05:35:11,780 --> 05:35:13,780
That's impossible

4096
05:35:14,900 --> 05:35:23,300
You'll get it later. Okay. Are you both healing me up? Okay, right? There's gonna be enemies ahead. Unfortunately. They've all reset, but

4097
05:35:23,780 --> 05:35:26,500
At least we know what okay something just went for me. I don't know

4098
05:35:29,620 --> 05:35:34,260
Okay, we're just absolutely gang violence, which is how I like it

4099
05:35:38,900 --> 05:35:42,740
So fireball fireball me

4100
05:35:45,620 --> 05:35:47,860
Wait, do the readers not actually

4101
05:35:50,180 --> 05:35:54,660
Or do the readers change their minds? Oh, wait, I think the readers don't hurt us

4102
05:35:56,500 --> 05:35:58,500
Okay

4103
05:35:59,460 --> 05:36:02,260
Why do I why my HP bar go off?

4104
05:36:11,300 --> 05:36:13,300
As if it all locks, I mean

4105
05:36:15,220 --> 05:36:18,260
Oh, there he is under the staircase. I think that was the guy that's

4106
05:36:19,060 --> 05:36:21,060
Hearing me

4107
05:36:22,580 --> 05:36:26,420

05:36:29,940 --> 05:36:31,940
Oh, this is the guy

4110
05:36:32,500 --> 05:36:34,500
Tell my reasons will you?

4111
05:36:35,380 --> 05:36:37,860
I don't think no no no no no this hoot

4112
05:36:38,740 --> 05:36:42,500
We actually I just I don't think we expected him to be so strong to follow

4113
05:36:43,380 --> 05:36:52,660
Do you want to do what are you sure are you doing? Is there is there a hidden item here?

4114
05:36:54,660 --> 05:36:57,380
Surely don't call me surely

4115
05:36:58,980 --> 05:37:00,980
Okay, right

4116
05:37:01,780 --> 05:37:03,780
Jump jump

4117
05:37:06,020 --> 05:37:09,380
Jump off just to know more

4118
05:37:09,700 --> 05:37:11,700
Just to know more

4119
05:37:13,380 --> 05:37:21,940
Oh, I'm getting his romp. What is it? What is it? Oh, it's to boost me to not take as much damage. Okay. I'm here for it

4120
05:37:23,540 --> 05:37:25,540
Okay, let's go

4121
05:37:26,820 --> 05:37:29,300
Oh, I miss that's okay. You don't have to hit everything

4122
05:37:30,580 --> 05:37:35,300
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take but it doesn't mean you're gonna hit 100% of the shots you take

4123
05:37:35,700 --> 05:37:37,700
That's not how probability works. Okay

4124
05:37:38,420 --> 05:37:40,420
Long as you try your best

4125
05:37:40,740 --> 05:37:43,780
I got a shadow militant iron man

4126
05:37:56,660 --> 05:37:58,820
Oh, there's missiles. Why are they at his feet?

4127
05:38:01,140 --> 05:38:03,140
Oh

4128
05:38:04,100 --> 05:38:09,460
There's three bands around the corner as well. I can see one looking at you. Oh my god

4129
05:38:10,500 --> 05:38:15,140
Okay, that was absolutely pathetic attempt, but it was an attempt on the left. The main thing

4130
05:38:22,020 --> 05:38:25,220
I need to watch how you guys did it

4131
05:38:26,900 --> 05:38:28,900
How do you do it? No

4132
05:38:30,260 --> 05:38:32,260
Did you just run and jump?

4133
05:38:33,460 --> 05:38:38,100
Run and big jump. Okay, and then you next run and big jump. Okay, run

4134
05:38:38,980 --> 05:38:40,980
Big jump. Okay

4135
05:38:41,220 --> 05:38:42,340
Shoo

4136
05:38:42,340 --> 05:38:45,140
What we got another thing to level up

4137
05:38:46,260 --> 05:38:48,260
Wow

4138
05:38:48,580 --> 05:38:54,820
We're doing it. We're doing it. We're getting mildly better at the game mildly better

4139
05:38:55,460 --> 05:38:57,700
Bro, that final boss had me watching for nine hours

4140
05:38:58,020 --> 05:39:03,300
When I was fighting the DLC boss after like 30 times I walked into the boss area and just started using the moon and cooking up

4141
05:39:03,700 --> 05:39:05,700
And you've given up. I've had enough mate

4142
05:39:10,100 --> 05:39:12,180
Uh, ain't that mean there's a boss ahead?

4143
05:39:13,700 --> 05:39:15,700
Where

4144
05:39:15,780 --> 05:39:18,980
Someone goes live someone goes right as we I am to the right that's why

4145
05:39:20,740 --> 05:39:22,740
I got stormhawk feathers

4146
05:39:22,740 --> 05:39:24,740
Okay

4147
05:39:26,260 --> 05:39:28,260
Let's see what's up

4148
05:39:30,100 --> 05:39:32,100
Fighting a bit of fighting mea

4149
05:39:32,820 --> 05:39:36,100
Fighting on a mage. Well, you know what we think about majors

4150
05:39:38,420 --> 05:39:40,580
Uh, please don't knock me off the map. That's my only request

4151
05:39:42,180 --> 05:39:46,660
Oh reflin. You're right in the middle of the fight darlin. Oh reflin. No

4152
05:39:48,180 --> 05:39:50,740
Oh reflin. You were right in the middle of the fight darlin

4153
05:39:52,900 --> 05:39:55,540
Oh, no, I didn't want you to perish

4154
05:39:57,220 --> 05:40:00,420
Smith what have we done? Forgive us refling

4155
05:40:00,980 --> 05:40:02,980
Forgive us. Wait, how do I

4156
05:40:03,860 --> 05:40:06,820
All right, hold on. There must be another one I can switch to that's like sad

4157
05:40:08,020 --> 05:40:14,500
The raptor why refling why we have forsaken you refling? No

4158
05:40:15,220 --> 05:40:17,220
I'm sorry

4159
05:40:18,740 --> 05:40:24,820
Okay, right. Okay. Okay, we get it. Okay, we get it. Geez. Take the same way don't you?

4160
05:40:25,380 --> 05:40:28,020
I'm sure there's not even hold them. I'm not even drill wheels and mobblies

4161
05:40:28,820 --> 05:40:34,180
Honestly sick. Well, if we're getting dated now by a non refling I can cry

4162
05:40:39,140 --> 05:40:41,140
Um, what is

4163
05:40:45,060 --> 05:40:47,060
What

4164
05:40:49,780 --> 05:40:51,780
Oh

4165
05:40:55,300 --> 05:40:59,300
Oh, oh you meant to do that holy crap. I was like what's what's hurting you?

4166
05:41:00,500 --> 05:41:02,500
Ah

4167
05:41:03,220 --> 05:41:05,220
Ah

4168
05:41:05,220 --> 05:41:06,740
No poise

4169
05:41:06,740 --> 05:41:07,780
No

4170
05:41:07,780 --> 05:41:08,980
Maley

4171
05:41:08,980 --> 05:41:10,980
No stamina perish

4172
05:41:11,940 --> 05:41:16,260
End of the corner of shame you bulls get shamed get shamed get shamed

4173
05:41:17,460 --> 05:41:19,780
God the smith's ones here are crazy

4174
05:41:21,060 --> 05:41:23,060
Label seven smithing

4175
05:41:28,660 --> 05:41:32,580
Get too bad these librarians don't really seem to mind this much. They're just chilling

4176
05:41:33,860 --> 05:41:34,900
What is this?

4177
05:41:34,900 --> 05:41:36,900
What the deer?

4178
05:41:37,060 --> 05:41:41,140
He died for the safety of my he shall be remembered as one of his mom's finest

4179
05:41:41,780 --> 05:41:43,780
for a reason

4180
05:41:44,420 --> 05:41:48,180
I'm sure if I get out you're being invaded. No, I'm going to be raging

4181
05:41:49,300 --> 05:41:52,180
Do we need to go for him? Are you sneaking up on a mage?

4182
05:41:58,500 --> 05:42:00,500
Wait, he's talking

4183
05:42:02,980 --> 05:42:04,980
He talks

4184
05:42:07,380 --> 05:42:10,100
No, something's talking I hear it

4185
05:42:13,140 --> 05:42:15,140
Oh, well

4186
05:42:16,900 --> 05:42:18,900
Something's talking that it said take it slow

4187
05:42:20,580 --> 05:42:22,580
By my lord

4188
05:42:22,660 --> 05:42:25,860
I ever make sense of his jumble. Are you?

4189
05:42:26,740 --> 05:42:29,060
What are you? Is there something here?

4190
05:42:29,060 --> 05:42:31,060
I

4191
05:42:37,940 --> 05:42:45,380
Think you need to pull a lever lever lever and in this room

4192
05:42:53,860 --> 05:42:55,860
Over here

4193
05:43:00,020 --> 05:43:02,020
I

4194
05:43:06,660 --> 05:43:10,020
Oh, they're above me. Okay, that means a lot more sense. I'm like

4195
05:43:18,980 --> 05:43:20,980
Okay

4196
05:43:22,900 --> 05:43:24,900
Yeah

4197
05:43:29,060 --> 05:43:33,300
When I have the chance so we're to go talk to a man

4198
05:43:47,940 --> 05:43:52,100
There is an mpc chilling at a grace that is very confused right now

4199
05:43:52,820 --> 05:43:58,020
Damn, I just got the inappropriate behavior detected glitch the whole area is literally I was like

4200
05:43:59,060 --> 05:44:05,620
Not gonna lie me hump and reef lens before fight. I was like, oh my god. They knew exactly what I'm doing the implication

4201
05:44:06,180 --> 05:44:08,180
they knew

4202
05:44:23,300 --> 05:44:25,460
Okay, it's fine the stairs are there the stairs are there

4203
05:44:26,420 --> 05:44:33,700
I'm nervous. I was like, where am I? I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry. I just thought okay there. I can do it if I do it straight

4204
05:44:37,700 --> 05:44:39,700
I got a reverence for ash

4205
05:44:41,780 --> 05:44:44,980
Oh, we don't continue the thing. Sorry. Hey, where do we go now?

4206
05:44:46,340 --> 05:44:48,340
down

4207
05:44:48,340 --> 05:44:50,340
along

4208
05:44:50,340 --> 05:44:52,340
The reefland killing after

4209
05:44:56,420 --> 05:44:58,420
I'm sorry we wasn't moving

4210
05:44:58,820 --> 05:45:00,820
Are we

4211
05:45:02,180 --> 05:45:06,180
I'm looking at you. You have the torch. Wait. What are you doing? Are you teasing?

4212
05:45:07,940 --> 05:45:09,620
Down

4213
05:45:09,620 --> 05:45:11,620
Okay, down

4214
05:45:12,500 --> 05:45:14,500
Okay, we're doing down into the ray and

4215
05:45:18,420 --> 05:45:21,060
Yeah, there's nothing in here we killed our witch in here

4216
05:45:26,180 --> 05:45:31,060
Why do you get aggressive? You're just reading a book. My god. Why is everyone so mean to tarnished?

4217
05:45:32,340 --> 05:45:36,180
Like I could easily walk past you and none of that would have occurred

4218
05:45:36,900 --> 05:45:38,900
Just kind of help yourself

4219
05:45:39,540 --> 05:45:41,540
Heating on the tarnish like I'm lost

4220
05:45:42,180 --> 05:45:44,180
Oh, there you are

4221
05:45:44,180 --> 05:45:46,020
Who's an item here?

4222
05:45:46,020 --> 05:45:48,020
Who begins? Who begins?

4223
05:45:49,780 --> 05:45:52,820
Oh quite literally, uh pull the lever crunk

4224
05:45:56,180 --> 05:45:58,180
I

4225
05:45:59,780 --> 05:46:01,780
Something happened

4226
05:46:04,580 --> 05:46:06,580
Oh, I see it now

4227
05:46:18,020 --> 05:46:21,620
Whoa, this place is getting very big very tall very high up

4228
05:46:21,620 --> 05:46:25,860
Oh, why are you coming this way?

4229
05:46:29,220 --> 05:46:31,220
Oh, I was at the right bit

4230
05:46:32,820 --> 05:46:35,540
You guys want to go first? I was getting nervous. I'm gonna bump you off

4231
05:46:41,380 --> 05:46:43,860
Surely there's no enemies that will bump you off here

4232
05:46:46,100 --> 05:46:48,100
Like shoot you from afar type thing

4233
05:46:52,180 --> 05:46:54,180
You

4234
05:46:54,980 --> 05:46:57,540
Oh, I see him the enemy that's gonna bump us off

4235
05:46:59,620 --> 05:47:04,180
He's like no you're okay. All right, it can't be up there

4236
05:47:14,580 --> 05:47:16,580
Let's do that one

4237
05:47:17,380 --> 05:47:21,860
Who's the enemy above? We're not gonna get sniped by that little twat over there, aren't we?

4238
05:47:32,740 --> 05:47:34,740
Okay cleared that very thank you

4239
05:47:46,580 --> 05:47:48,580

Okay, there's that looks scary don't really want to do that just yet wasn't here. This is safer. This looks safer in here

4241
05:48:02,340 --> 05:48:04,340
Are you guys fighting?

4242
05:48:05,860 --> 05:48:11,700
No, is there no safe safe point in here? Oh stop it. I'm just the tarnish making the way

4243
05:48:12,500 --> 05:48:14,500
Making my way through the library

4244
05:48:15,060 --> 05:48:18,260
Something something it's a library and I'm home then

4245
05:48:19,700 --> 05:48:22,580
Oh my god, they're going for it replays. I wasn't even in the fight with you

4246
05:48:24,100 --> 05:48:26,100
Hold on. I'm coming

4247
05:48:27,540 --> 05:48:29,540
Oh

4248
05:48:29,700 --> 05:48:31,700
Just trumpeted that man today

4249
05:48:33,060 --> 05:48:35,940
I didn't even need me. Okay. No. No alone

4250
05:48:37,540 --> 05:48:39,540
Alone

4251
05:48:45,300 --> 05:48:47,300
Yeah

4252
05:48:47,700 --> 05:48:49,700
Gravity strike

4253
05:48:51,300 --> 05:48:53,300
Why another one

4254
05:48:54,580 --> 05:48:56,580
We're gonna be so

4255
05:48:57,700 --> 05:49:00,900
Is it increases defense and attack or just defense?

4256
05:49:03,540 --> 05:49:06,740
Uh, this is like a boss fight if I've ever seen one I'm gonna be honest

4257
05:49:07,940 --> 05:49:12,900
I'm gonna be honest might need a break in a cup of tea if I've ever seen a boss fight. This is clearly one

4258
05:49:15,460 --> 05:49:17,940
Oh, let's see what we're up against

4259
05:49:19,140 --> 05:49:22,820
Let's see. I don't know what it is. What is it?

4260
05:49:24,260 --> 05:49:28,660
It's a crypt fight a crypt or small room medium

4261
05:49:31,380 --> 05:49:34,260
Oh my god, when your character makes the cutscene and it's actually you

4262
05:49:34,260 --> 05:49:36,260
Yeah

4263
05:49:41,700 --> 05:49:43,700
Mongrel intruder

4264
05:49:50,980 --> 05:49:53,540
That tarnished it seemed

4265
05:49:58,500 --> 05:50:00,500
Bossless

4266
05:50:01,460 --> 05:50:05,620
What's that truly lordship sanctioned in one so

4267
05:50:10,020 --> 05:50:12,020
Huh

05:50:14,820 --> 05:50:23,380
Magista no my purpose stand if unchanged. Oh the elongated arms, please no

4269
05:50:24,660 --> 05:50:27,860
Those stripped of the grace of gold

4270
05:50:28,500 --> 05:50:30,500
Shall all meet death

4271
05:50:32,740 --> 05:50:34,740
Oh, no

4272
05:50:37,620 --> 05:50:39,620
In the embrace

4273
05:50:44,660 --> 05:50:47,620
Oh no, oh no

4274
05:50:50,900 --> 05:50:53,780
Um AOE fireball

4275
05:50:53,780 --> 05:50:55,780
Oh

4276
05:50:56,020 --> 05:50:58,020
Large melee strength

4277
05:50:59,460 --> 05:51:01,460
A reef fling

4278
05:51:24,580 --> 05:51:26,580
I do not

4279
05:51:32,340 --> 05:51:34,340
I'm not fucking after about it

4280
05:51:37,060 --> 05:51:42,420
Who stripped of the grace of gold channel death in the embrace of mess

4281
05:51:47,780 --> 05:51:49,780
Oh

4282
05:51:50,340 --> 05:51:54,020
Right are you guys looking about go make a cup of tea?

4283
05:51:55,140 --> 05:51:59,300
I think I'm gonna need a little cup of tea for this one. I'm not gonna lie

4284
05:52:02,980 --> 05:52:09,300
Okay for any beefland that wants to try and help me we're in the dark chamber entrance

4285
05:52:11,540 --> 05:52:17,060
I will make a new boss list because I don't know how long we're gonna be here. This is the snake boss

4286
05:52:20,420 --> 05:52:26,260
And I'll do I'll do a little bit of green to show that even though the snake was red. I'll make you

4287
05:52:31,940 --> 05:52:33,940
And then I'll put some red because he's actually

4288
05:52:35,860 --> 05:52:39,780
Sorry, just straight up doodling. I don't mind me. You should be making a cup of tea right now, but

4289
05:52:41,780 --> 05:52:43,460
Okay

4290
05:52:43,460 --> 05:52:46,260
I'll also start a boss list now whenever I do a boss list

4291
05:52:46,420 --> 05:52:50,820
It doesn't count as an adventure list it counts as a boss run russian

4292
05:52:52,900 --> 05:52:54,900
Ruchine for fuck me

4293
05:52:55,780 --> 05:53:02,980
Ruchine it's not boss in sorry that's scott's been applied to your name. I'm sorry if I pronounce your stuff terribly wrong

4294
05:53:03,860 --> 05:53:09,220
Uh our first duo ruchine and hyloid. I'm going to very quickly make a cup of tea. I highly recommend

4295
05:53:09,220 --> 05:53:15,780
Please get out. Please do stretch a zero for any bleeding heart watchers a zero is going up in five minutes

4296
05:53:16,660 --> 05:53:21,460
Um, please do give her a check. I can't remember what game she's playing

4297
05:53:25,540 --> 05:53:30,340
Um, I will make a cup of tea though. Okay, I don't know. I'm on course. I've got a dm

4298
05:53:42,020 --> 05:53:44,020
Oh

4299
05:53:47,220 --> 05:53:49,220
Yeah

4300
05:53:55,300 --> 05:53:56,420
Uh

4301
05:53:56,420 --> 05:54:00,020
Sorry, I zeroed with like are we supposed to play ads here in streams and I'm like, no

4302
05:54:00,660 --> 05:54:04,340
No, it ruins the viewer. She just doesn't know better, but um

4303
05:54:08,580 --> 05:54:13,380
And I said no interrupts the viewer experience far too much

4304
05:54:14,340 --> 05:54:16,340
And

4305
05:54:16,420 --> 05:54:21,220
We're learning out of here. We're getting better. She was doing leak rage as much

4306
05:54:23,940 --> 05:54:31,300
And no, and we are not going to play ads during spain some people like, you know, some agencies can I completely get it

4307
05:54:31,300 --> 05:54:32,660
It helps pay for yourself

4308
05:54:32,660 --> 05:54:38,340
I would rather value the viewer's experience now some don't get me wrong some folk are like, oh, I'm away for a pee

4309
05:54:38,500 --> 05:54:41,140
Like I'll go run and add but I feel like it's just too intrusive

4310
05:54:41,140 --> 05:54:47,300
Like I'd rather you sat and looked at my little snot bubble and my hypnotic hair than sit through like some ads

4311
05:54:47,300 --> 05:54:50,740
That you couldn't give less of a rat or something like I'm sorry the way the internet is going

4312
05:54:50,900 --> 05:54:55,700
It's like you can't even access an internet page other than wikipedia

4313
05:54:56,020 --> 05:54:59,460
Without being advertised to like you can't even search up mothers

4314
05:54:59,700 --> 05:55:05,700
I want a uh apple pie recipe without getting some fucking essay full of buzzwords to try and get higher up and like

4315
05:55:06,020 --> 05:55:08,020
So it's on to

4316
05:55:10,900 --> 05:55:16,180
I'd honestly consider dropping youtube if I couldn't block ads on it. Oh boy. Do I have an update for you?

4317
05:55:16,580 --> 05:55:21,620
Um, they're actually going to integrate ads into videos if that makes sense

4318
05:55:22,180 --> 05:55:25,060
So it will not register as an advertisement

4319
05:55:25,140 --> 05:55:29,700
It will register as a streamed part of the service of youtube when you click on a video

4320
05:55:30,180 --> 05:55:33,060
I don't know when that's gonna happen, but it has been announced

4321
05:55:33,380 --> 05:55:38,980
So I don't know what's going to be the result of that nonsense, but uh, yeah

4322
05:55:40,900 --> 05:55:46,580
I don't know. I don't know how they're going to do it because I

4323
05:55:50,340 --> 05:55:56,260
Unfortunately, I'm too uneducated and how like legal advertisements work and how

4324
05:55:57,540 --> 05:55:59,540
and how

4325
05:56:00,260 --> 05:56:06,100
People should have a right to not have advertisements shoved down their throat every two seconds

4326
05:56:07,380 --> 05:56:14,340
I don't know enough education about advertisements and all that jazz, but I very strongly feel like as

4327
05:56:15,620 --> 05:56:18,020
Give me the tinfoil hat before I borrow this cup of tea

4328
05:56:19,300 --> 05:56:21,300
If you go outside

4329
05:56:21,380 --> 05:56:24,820
Try and make a note of how many advertisements you see

4330
05:56:25,620 --> 05:56:29,780
Whether that has been normalized like having a car brand

4331
05:56:30,900 --> 05:56:31,860
Advertisement

4332
05:56:31,860 --> 05:56:39,220
You go shopping and you get a bag free advertisement the clothes you wear free advertisement because it's what'll be logo on it

4333
05:56:39,780 --> 05:56:42,580
like the bombardment of

4334
05:56:43,620 --> 05:56:49,700
Advertisement you experience when you go outside is batch and say hey look at your come look at your setup

4335
05:56:49,700 --> 05:56:51,620
Look at your computer right now

4336
05:56:51,620 --> 05:56:55,460
What do you see you can see the logo of your monitor right now?

4337
05:56:55,700 --> 05:56:58,820
Look on your keyboard. You can see the logo of your keyboard right now

4338
05:56:58,980 --> 05:57:02,980
Look at your mouse. You can see the logo of the mouse the heads that everything is like little

4339
05:57:03,700 --> 05:57:09,060
Little advertisements to just feel useless useless like I'm looking at my 3d. It's got a 3d. I'm looking at my focus right

4340
05:57:09,060 --> 05:57:11,860
It's got focus right on it. I'm looking at the bottom of the water. It's got like

4341
05:57:12,500 --> 05:57:13,540
um

4342
05:57:13,540 --> 05:57:14,740
Now don't get me wrong

4343
05:57:14,740 --> 05:57:18,580
I understand putting the company name or brand on something

4344
05:57:18,980 --> 05:57:22,500
But when you start to consider everything as an advertisement

4345
05:57:23,460 --> 05:57:25,460
Nothing is sacred

4346
05:57:26,260 --> 05:57:28,260
Nothing is sacred everything

4347
05:57:28,740 --> 05:57:35,140
Everything has their brand on it. Everything has their logo on it. There's like what who is it?

4348
05:57:35,220 --> 05:57:40,020
There's someone that just wear like plain white t-shirt knee tag on the back say and

4349
05:57:41,300 --> 05:57:44,100
But I all have to be done with that. This rant is sponsored by rage

4350
05:57:45,700 --> 05:57:47,700
I don't know what they pay you

4351
05:57:48,420 --> 05:57:51,620
I heard raid shadow legends like when streamers stream it

4352
05:57:52,260 --> 05:57:54,260
I don't know if they pay good for stream

4353
05:57:54,500 --> 05:57:57,220
Time to make our own flows the reefling way

4354
05:57:58,100 --> 05:57:59,460
exactly

4355
05:57:59,460 --> 05:58:06,820
Wait, it's all advertising always hasn't think of how normalized it is though. Imagine what 200 years back

4356
05:58:07,380 --> 05:58:09,380
the most advertisement you got

4357
05:58:10,260 --> 05:58:12,100
Have you I've actually got an

4358
05:58:13,060 --> 05:58:16,260
I've actually got an interest in old glass bottles

4359
05:58:16,820 --> 05:58:19,220
from like before before like

4360
05:58:19,780 --> 05:58:23,780
You know the big thing and like they it used to be like this is

4361
05:58:24,580 --> 05:58:26,660
um produced by

4362
05:58:26,660 --> 05:58:33,780
This family for this bottle type thing of medicine type thing and it was just fascinating because it wasn't like a faceless corporation

4363
05:58:34,100 --> 05:58:39,460
It was like no, this is a family lineage like, you know when a company's like, oh, let's celebrate

4364
05:58:39,460 --> 05:58:44,980
We've been in business for a hundred years. There's no soul to you. All you care about is the stock market

4365
05:58:45,140 --> 05:58:51,540
All you care about is your ceo getting his pockets fat or else he can get so type thing because of the way the system's set up

4366
05:58:51,860 --> 05:58:53,860
like it feels like no one

4367
05:58:54,180 --> 05:58:55,380
no

4368
05:58:55,380 --> 05:58:59,620
Entity that makes a stupendous amount of money has any soul to it

4369
05:59:00,020 --> 05:59:03,380
And like you shouldn't have any loyalty to like your workplace either

4370
05:59:03,460 --> 05:59:08,900
But who benefits when inflation goes up and you're forced to work or else you're homeless type thing who benefits?

4371
05:59:09,940 --> 05:59:15,460
And who suffers? Hmm. Yeah, again. That's the same. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, right?

4372
05:59:15,460 --> 05:59:22,260
I'm gonna go make a cup of tea before I put a tinfoil hat on. I'm so sorry. I can't stop as soon as I get started

4373
05:59:22,740 --> 05:59:26,180
I genuinely can't stop right. I'm gonna make a cup of tea. Oh, I don't need the toilet running

4374
05:59:26,500 --> 05:59:29,000
I'm just making a cup of tea. I'll be a minute. I'll be a minute

4375
05:59:39,460 --> 05:59:41,460
You

4376
06:00:09,460 --> 06:00:11,460
You

4377
06:00:39,460 --> 06:00:41,460
You

4378
06:01:02,020 --> 06:01:04,020
Are you squidding me right now

4379
06:01:09,460 --> 06:01:11,460
You

4380
06:01:26,660 --> 06:01:28,660
Are you squidding me right now

4381
06:01:39,460 --> 06:01:41,460
You

4382
06:02:09,460 --> 06:02:11,460
You

4383
06:02:32,820 --> 06:02:34,820
Right, I'm not being funny

4384
06:02:35,380 --> 06:02:37,940
The kettle's still boiling so I can't make my tea yet

4385
06:02:38,020 --> 06:02:45,300
I'm currently having a fucking one-sided argument talking to myself looking at the kettle pointing my finger at the kettle being like

4386
06:02:46,100 --> 06:02:47,620
like

4387
06:02:47,620 --> 06:02:54,020
Because someone was like oh, she's a communist and I'm like actually communism can't work because a fucking greedy bastards in society

4388
06:02:54,020 --> 06:02:57,540
Always trying to get themselves up. I'm like fucking arguing with myself right now

4389
06:02:58,020 --> 06:03:04,260
I'm like no communism would work if there was nice members of society that all unanimously had the right thought process

4390
06:03:04,340 --> 06:03:07,460
It can't fucking work because it's some greedy fucking arse hat at the top

4391
06:03:07,700 --> 06:03:09,460
Like they can't even bloody help themselves

4392
06:03:09,460 --> 06:03:11,780
They can't help themselves trying to get a one-up trying to get better

4393
06:03:12,100 --> 06:03:18,500
So it can't work because there's members in society that do not belong in societies that create such utopian environments

4394
06:03:18,500 --> 06:03:22,740
Okay, it's not fucking possible. Okay. I'm actually going fucking mental on one, right?

4395
06:03:23,140 --> 06:03:26,900
So then what's the solution? Oh, strongy, strongy. Oh, you do this complain, but what's the solution?

4396
06:03:27,140 --> 06:03:30,820
I can't give you a solution. I'm not educated enough to give a solution

4397
06:03:31,220 --> 06:03:37,380
All I know is that I can point out the problems and make you aware of it to shift society's views

4398
06:03:37,540 --> 06:03:44,900
Even just slightly even if a few reeflings want to come along and just understand that if you're ever down and out in life

4399
06:03:45,060 --> 06:03:49,540
It's not your fault. The system is built up against you. I'm fucking raging. I'm

4400
06:03:50,820 --> 06:03:55,620
Anyway, right. I'm gonna make my cup of tea. I'll be back in a second. Just let you should know I'm having an argument with myself

4401
06:04:00,820 --> 06:04:02,820
You

4402
06:04:30,820 --> 06:04:32,820
You

4403
06:05:00,820 --> 06:05:02,820
You

4404
06:05:30,820 --> 06:05:32,820
You

4405
06:06:00,820 --> 06:06:02,820
You

4406
06:06:30,820 --> 06:06:32,820
You

4407
06:06:45,700 --> 06:06:50,180
Right, I'm back. I have tea and I have my raisins that opened up the other day because they're probably gonna get me

4408
06:06:50,980 --> 06:06:52,980
I have water

4409
06:06:53,220 --> 06:06:59,700
How did I do that? I have water inside my hoodie sleeve when I wash my hands. Oh my god, I'm gonna put the video off so I hold on

4410
06:07:00,820 --> 06:07:02,820
Oh, it's like freezing cold enough my sleeve

4411
06:07:12,260 --> 06:07:18,420
I don't know how I managed that. My elbow is no way. I have bruising on my arm. Why do I have bruising on my arm?

4412
06:07:18,980 --> 06:07:22,180
You can breathe as you see then take two

4413
06:07:24,340 --> 06:07:30,260
No more hoodie what's left? Oh, it's been put through frozen. I actually haven't even closed it yet

4414
06:07:32,980 --> 06:07:37,540
Oh, thank you. I poor in times to have to

4415
06:07:38,660 --> 06:07:40,660
You have to leave it

4416
06:07:40,660 --> 06:07:58,660
I'm not running anymore. I'm a well-adjusted streamer. I love society. I love how everything

4417
06:07:58,660 --> 06:08:05,700
works out in the end. Nope, it never does. Until the people rise up. I'm bruising a

4418
06:08:05,700 --> 06:08:10,940
whole lot. I have bruises on my arm, which I'm not used to. I get bruises on my leg when

4419
06:08:10,940 --> 06:08:17,940
I ride my bike because I always kick the back pedal off the back of my leg and all over

4420
06:08:17,940 --> 06:08:24,140
my knees I get bruises and stuff. Oh my controller's going to sleep. Wake up. I'm going to have

4421
06:08:24,140 --> 06:08:37,940
some reasons. It's my energy for this fight. I'm starting to feel like I love you so much.

4422
06:08:37,940 --> 06:08:43,640
Obviously. Yeah, do you like the thought of me waiting for a kettle to boil and pointing

4423
06:08:43,640 --> 06:08:50,340
at it and arguing with it? Like an absolute mad woman? How do you get rug bar in your

4424
06:08:50,340 --> 06:09:01,140
knees? Do you wear shorts? Yeah? Yes? Okay. I actually started arguing with the kettle

4425
06:09:01,140 --> 06:09:10,580
whilst I'm pulling the milk out of the fridge. Oh my god. I'm so used to my pedal hitting

4426
06:09:10,580 --> 06:09:25,380
my shin and all that. I'm doing the same thing. That's what I've always wanted. I love doing

4427
06:09:25,380 --> 06:09:39,020
abstract arguments in my head. Who dare opposes me? Fuck you. I'll slice you down. A snake

4428
06:09:39,020 --> 06:09:47,340
man mesmer? I know you're going to win this time. Oh yeah? Sorry, I'm just going to have

4429
06:09:47,340 --> 06:09:53,980
a few raisins and put it back in the fridge. I'm eating them, but I'm not hungry. I just

4430
06:09:53,980 --> 06:10:02,820
need a little bit more energy on. Mm-hmm. I thought it was normal to argue with your

4431
06:10:02,820 --> 06:10:10,740
kickwear. Oh no, reflingers get to me. Wait until you develop your nape personality disorder.

4432
06:10:10,740 --> 06:10:31,340
I'm going to put you through with him. You're going to run a mill. Oh, also, rain me. I let

4433
06:10:31,340 --> 06:10:42,940
you out. I'm swinging the door right now. I don't know if you can hear it, but I'm swinging

4434
06:10:42,940 --> 06:10:54,940
the door to get the fricking meat out of the room. It's just that piece of meat. It's

4435
06:10:54,940 --> 06:11:05,140
probably, I shouldn't actually hear that horn. How long until we remind you? An hour, 30 minutes?

4436
06:11:05,140 --> 06:11:11,460
I don't know. 30 minutes just to make sure I still have two cats. Right, who have we

4437
06:11:11,460 --> 06:11:17,780
gotten the line up to do? We have Ty Lord and we have Ruchin. I am going to shove on

4438
06:11:17,780 --> 06:11:29,500
my meat fucking crossbow. No, that's going to statically do much, but that ultimate from

4439
06:11:29,500 --> 06:11:40,540
the crossbow, if he stands still, honestly, might be the way to do it. Honestly. I'm going

4440
06:11:40,540 --> 06:11:46,700
to give it a try and see if I can rapid-fire ultimate on him. Are you guys ready? Are you

4441
06:11:46,740 --> 06:11:53,460
ready? Okay, you're moving closer. Edging. We're edging. We're edging. We're going. We're

4442
06:11:53,460 --> 06:12:10,460
going. He doesn't stand still. Fuck! Wait, what? Why is it not letting me do my ultimate?

4443
06:12:10,540 --> 06:12:17,420
I don't know. I don't know why it's not letting me do my ultimate. Is he poisoned already? No,

4444
06:12:17,420 --> 06:12:29,180
he can't be. Is that you guys? Oh my, oh my. Oh my gosh. I'm absolutely spamming trigger.

4445
06:12:29,180 --> 06:12:37,740
I'm so sorry if you can hear my little controller go off. You have to two-hand it. Wait, what?

4446
06:12:37,780 --> 06:12:44,020
I just put it away. Hold on. Wait, what am I doing? Sorry, am I having a stroke replant?

4447
06:12:44,020 --> 06:13:01,260
No. Oh my God. Is that even hit? I mean, it's alright. Does that work? God, that's too

4448
06:13:01,260 --> 06:13:22,260
easy. Hey, Lee. No. I mean, okay, reflings. Hold the four. Hold the four. Hold. I need

4449
06:13:22,260 --> 06:13:29,900
to put it back on this one. Yeah, I do. Okay, that's fine. Oh no, no, no, no, no, my refling.

4450
06:13:29,900 --> 06:13:36,820
Oh no. Oh no. I don't like this.

4451
06:13:52,260 --> 06:14:01,380
I don't like it. No, mother. Forgive me.

4452
06:14:08,740 --> 06:14:10,580
Darkness? He's going to darkness?

4453
06:14:22,260 --> 06:14:43,700
He's going to eat his own. No, okay, sorry. He's doing madness? Flame and madness?

4454
06:14:43,700 --> 06:14:52,540
I'm getting a bit nervous. I'm getting a bit shaky. I didn't like what I was doing.

4455
06:14:52,540 --> 06:15:00,500
Is he going to be a basilisk? Soon, tarnished.

4456
06:15:00,500 --> 06:15:20,580
Wilt thou be taken in the jaws of the abyssal serpent, Shorn of Light?

4457
06:15:31,060 --> 06:15:32,580
Refling.

4458
06:15:42,580 --> 06:15:44,580
Oh, I'm on show.

4459
06:15:44,660 --> 06:16:00,660
Oh, I can't even get a moment to respond.

4460
06:16:08,660 --> 06:16:10,660
Oh, my dear.

4461
06:16:14,660 --> 06:16:26,660
Why? Why are we supposed to defeat that?

4462
06:16:28,660 --> 06:16:36,660
Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear. Why are we supposed to defeat that?

4463
06:16:36,740 --> 06:16:49,140
I don't. That's the fun part you're doing. I think we're going to have to come back.

4464
06:16:56,020 --> 06:16:59,860
Oh, hope is lost when the French comes out. Literally the only time I can consistently

4465
06:16:59,860 --> 06:17:07,060
speak French is to ask why. Why am I forsaken? ASMR's littlest warrior versus a big snake.

4466
06:17:11,860 --> 06:17:15,140
This is the final boss of the DLC. He's a guy from the cover.

4467
06:17:17,620 --> 06:17:27,220
Grinding for runes? Are you joking? Grinding for runes? I'm level 210, boosted. And you want me

4468
06:17:27,220 --> 06:17:35,220
to go looking for weasels? The guy on the cover is never the final boss. There's some optional

4469
06:17:35,220 --> 06:17:39,300
stuff you can do right now. Oh, this isn't, I was going to say this can't be the final boss.

4470
06:17:39,300 --> 06:17:46,420
Everyone's like, oh, do you see massive, do you see massive? You need, you don't need runes,

4471
06:17:46,420 --> 06:17:51,700
you need the fragment. Okay, there is a scorpion rune I ignored because I couldn't spawn you guys

4472
06:17:51,700 --> 06:17:59,460
in. About two scared. I think I need to bring you back down. Okay, I need to bring you back

4473
06:17:59,460 --> 06:18:02,900
down these stairs because I missed one back here because I was too scared. But no, that

4474
06:18:02,900 --> 06:18:12,660
have you guys, I'm not scared anyway. Okay, do the gate before the lion. It's the one at the scorpion.

4475
06:18:13,220 --> 06:18:26,180
Okay, we're at seven for blessing and then the revered ash blessing. Okay, I need to take you

4476
06:18:26,180 --> 06:18:39,540
guys down the stairs here. This is just exploration. Okay, and come back briefly. God, you were quick

4477
06:18:39,540 --> 06:18:49,060
on that. You could also put more smithing stones in a way. I guess because I picked up so many,

4478
06:18:49,060 --> 06:18:57,460
right? I mean, mate, I feel like the crossbow's the only way that's keeping me alive. Azuridule

4479
06:18:57,460 --> 06:19:01,540
is most likely streaming live right now. I'm about to go best to look everyone

4480
06:19:01,540 --> 06:19:09,380
about damn time. Oh, you did amazing. Thank you for all the carries. We things we are at stage

4481
06:19:09,380 --> 06:19:20,100
front in the DLC. It's to the left stage front in front of the lion. You can't call up here.

4482
06:19:21,860 --> 06:19:22,980
Why do I hear boss music?

4483
06:19:23,860 --> 06:19:32,900
You can't summon after the boss back and summon an enemy. How am I supposed to get you guys to help me?

4484
06:19:36,100 --> 06:19:41,860
Who fucking wrote this book honestly? Right, wait, hold on. Okay, I guess we need to backtrack.

4485
06:19:41,860 --> 06:19:45,620
Refling, can I ask you to kindly leave pretty please? I'll take your name out because I didn't

4486
06:19:45,620 --> 06:19:57,140
realize. Thank you. No, no, you can't leave me. There's too many enemies. I need reflings to help me.

4487
06:19:59,220 --> 06:20:03,940
There's scorpions everywhere. I need to go, I need to go two thingies away and then the

4488
06:20:03,940 --> 06:20:12,340
refling is leaving. Are you sure? I'll trust your judgment, but if I die, it's up to you.

4489
06:20:14,340 --> 06:20:18,580
Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Thank you. I need the reflings to help me through the scorpion pit.

4490
06:20:19,540 --> 06:20:29,460
Right, so do we, is it this one? The private altar. It may be the private altar.

4491
06:20:30,420 --> 06:20:36,900
We can go for the scream and coconut as well. Oh yeah, we need to do that. Yes, we'll do that.

4492
06:20:36,900 --> 06:20:39,780
Okay, I need to get this missing one by the scorpion.

4493
06:20:48,020 --> 06:20:55,380
Can I not fucking get anyone in? And all the castles doesn't work at all. All pieces. Right,

4494
06:20:55,460 --> 06:21:00,820
we're doing the coconut then. Where's the coconut? You can only do red tier though,

4495
06:21:00,820 --> 06:21:07,140
the boss of the Legacy Dungeon is dead. Whoa, that's so silly. I can't believe they saw my

4496
06:21:07,140 --> 06:21:12,500
gameplay from a year ago and then prevented it from happening again. Yeah, I already tried

4497
06:21:12,500 --> 06:21:17,460
all that. It's the white wall preventing from coming inside. Don't you dare leave Strone

4498
06:21:17,540 --> 06:21:26,420
alone. What is the name of the coconut? A pudimmi? No, that's all right.

4499
06:21:28,180 --> 06:21:34,340
That's me. Coconut is at the very bottom of the map. We're down here. We're here

4500
06:21:35,700 --> 06:21:43,860
at the fourth church of Mersa, the moaning one. Oh, there's a boss at the Black Gate. It's

4501
06:21:43,940 --> 06:21:49,940
walking like four or five. Actually, it's a few areas that we can travel. The moaning one is in

4502
06:21:49,940 --> 06:22:00,980
the DLC map. Wimpering coconut is in DLC map? No. No, this cannot be.

4503
06:22:04,660 --> 06:22:12,180
Say you're having a giggle. Oh, right. Okay, we're going to go to High Cross and we're going to take

4504
06:22:12,180 --> 06:22:17,620
a right down to whatever this is because there's something here, okay? So High Cross

4505
06:22:19,460 --> 06:22:24,980
and then we'll take a right down the path. We'll go north and then right. North and east.

4506
06:22:28,820 --> 06:22:36,900
Billy, game. Do you talk to me now? No, sorry. Hello. Hi. Did you feel it? But while my devotions

4507
06:22:36,900 --> 06:22:43,780
are chiming by my trust, I know it. I can wield my sword to call the undeserving,

4508
06:22:44,420 --> 06:22:49,860
those unfit to bask in tenderness. This is so cult, Prathen. Be careful. I should have thought of this

4509
06:22:49,860 --> 06:22:56,580
earlier. But me? I'm allowed to be your prophecy. Oh, prophecy. Prophecy.

4510
06:22:58,580 --> 06:23:05,940
What remedy do you presume us allies even now? Don't make an aspen is newly broken. I must profess

4511
06:23:06,980 --> 06:23:13,780
the spell mattered little. Uphold his covenant, make an ashell. Then America and vilest our tree,

4512
06:23:13,780 --> 06:23:22,820
both. And surely I contended I will be. No, I don't think so, bro. I think you're going to be upset.

4513
06:23:25,060 --> 06:23:29,380
There's only one exit. Okay, thank god I can get you guys in, right? Who's not being in?

4514
06:23:30,340 --> 06:23:35,940
You were my enemy. Well, I just reset the...

4515
06:23:39,380 --> 06:23:44,980
Wait, I can't... Oh, I can't be doing it. I'm doing this all in the wrong order,

4516
06:23:44,980 --> 06:23:47,380
so I can't tell if it's like being the last one that came in or not.

4517
06:23:48,820 --> 06:23:51,460
Hey, mage. And then you become my enemy, other refling.

4518
06:23:52,020 --> 06:23:56,180
Make sure you guys can actually connect first.

4519
06:23:57,300 --> 06:24:02,740
But not connect four in the classic. There's either an ash or fragment at the tip of the lake

4520
06:24:02,740 --> 06:24:09,220
directly north of the rims along the road. I'll put my ash on your tip.

4521
06:24:10,020 --> 06:24:14,980
Right. The north of the... like here?

4522
06:24:16,580 --> 06:24:20,820
At the loop? Or do you mean at this lake? I mean, that's...

4523
06:24:23,380 --> 06:24:34,500
Who made it in? Mage made it in. Mage Reef made it in. Jess made it in. And so did M.

4524
06:24:34,900 --> 06:24:38,260
Okay, why does that not...

4525
06:24:39,700 --> 06:24:43,300
Always get worried if it doesn't lay in automatically. Right, I'm trying to drink the thingy.

4526
06:24:43,300 --> 06:24:45,140
The road that goes south of your location.

4527
06:24:56,020 --> 06:24:59,700
I'm not smart enough to swallow your directions. Do you mean something like here?

4528
06:24:59,940 --> 06:25:05,940
I'm too much of a daft. Bam.

4529
06:25:08,420 --> 06:25:13,700
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Right, we're going to go north and then there's going to be a right

4530
06:25:13,700 --> 06:25:18,100
in the road, okay? Oh, wait. Oh, do you want me to follow you? Do you know what to do?

4531
06:25:19,060 --> 06:25:25,220
You have a light, so it means I follow you? If you don't, if you have a light on, I follow.

4532
06:25:25,220 --> 06:25:29,220
If you don't have a light on, I don't follow. Oh, wait. Oh, you also have it.

4533
06:25:30,660 --> 06:25:33,940
Okay, we're just going to explore in a bit. Oh, let me put my sword on again.

4534
06:25:33,940 --> 06:25:36,820
We're just going to be exploring because I...

4535
06:25:38,980 --> 06:25:43,220
I would like to. That's my sense. I'd like to explore. Go to the castle,

4536
06:25:43,220 --> 06:25:46,420
front side of the grace, and then head south on up to get the coconut.

4537
06:25:47,220 --> 06:25:52,180
This way is long and arduous. What do you mean? It's about the journey.

4538
06:25:52,900 --> 06:25:58,420
It's about the journey and how we did it. Where the heck are we going?

4539
06:26:00,740 --> 06:26:05,780
Never been here before. It's like another settlement. There's a naughty horse.

4540
06:26:07,220 --> 06:26:10,260
We're just ignoring everything, I think. Oh, there's two naughty horses.

4541
06:26:10,260 --> 06:26:20,260
Um...

4542
06:26:23,700 --> 06:26:28,180
Just trying to make sure... Well, I'd say we're going to be out of bounds, but we're not.

4543
06:26:29,540 --> 06:26:31,540
No such thing as bounds in this game.

4544
06:26:33,940 --> 06:26:37,540
I think you get... I'm just walking some enemies around the corner. I repeat,

4545
06:26:37,540 --> 06:26:41,300
I've just walking some enemies around the corner. Oh, dear lord.

4546
06:26:42,420 --> 06:26:47,700
I'm not going to make it. This fuck is the site. There's some enemies that have been activated.

4547
06:26:47,700 --> 06:26:51,540
Please look out, Reflings.

4548
06:26:58,660 --> 06:26:59,860
You don't talk much, do you?

4549
06:27:00,180 --> 06:27:13,860
Okay, we did it. We're now fucking out.

4550
06:27:18,660 --> 06:27:21,540
Holy crap. Like, frost magic? That was cool.

4551
06:27:23,780 --> 06:27:28,180
I can't wait for the next deal seats coming, and then I'll do a full magic spec. I've never done magic before.

4552
06:27:30,340 --> 06:27:34,740
Uh, who am I following?

4553
06:27:37,060 --> 06:27:40,660
Okay, light on. I follow. Hold on, let me try and finish my tea when it's warm.

4554
06:27:44,500 --> 06:27:48,660
No, you can keep going. I've just fought... I'm playing one handed, so you need to protect me. That's the only thing.

4555
06:27:54,260 --> 06:27:56,020
Pass is going to pass me, because...

4556
06:27:56,020 --> 06:28:06,580
I see a horse. Have we aggroed him? We have. Okay, you absolutely walloped him with that magic.

4557
06:28:10,580 --> 06:28:13,460
I can dodge. Don't worry, I can dodge. I'm dodging. I'm dodging.

4558
06:28:18,580 --> 06:28:24,500
Oh, we had a critical hit. Is it critical hit or critical kill?

4559
06:28:26,820 --> 06:28:29,140
Okay, where are we heading?

4560
06:28:33,220 --> 06:28:33,860
Are we healing?

4561
06:28:35,940 --> 06:28:40,580
You look like a bird. You look like a puppy. Honestly, ready to yank that for Jen too?

4562
06:28:40,580 --> 06:28:42,820
Like a wings on the arms? I'm here for it.

4563
06:28:46,980 --> 06:28:54,020
But would she have human hands? Oh, would she have human hands? Or would she have, like...

4564
06:28:54,020 --> 06:29:01,140
We count. Would she just have, like, the wing end? Because I wonder what she would do.

4565
06:29:01,140 --> 06:29:03,700
Okay, I'm all healed up. I'm all healed.

4566
06:29:05,060 --> 06:29:09,620
Harpy, Jen too. I'm open for a fucking harpy. I don't care. I'm so open for a harpy.

4567
06:29:12,260 --> 06:29:17,620
Like, proper harpy with wings, knee hands. I'm down for it. I'm so down.

4568
06:29:18,020 --> 06:29:30,420
I don't know if she's gonna be in Jen too. I see. The Jen too concept, like, not concept art,

4569
06:29:31,060 --> 06:29:35,860
but the concept of their appeal has been created, if that makes sense. You know my little cringe

4570
06:29:35,860 --> 06:29:44,340
paragraph on the exposing stream where I was like, the paragraph about me was like, I don't

4571
06:29:44,340 --> 06:29:49,300
understand, like, that's where the rest of the story started from. If it's like, I don't understand

4572
06:29:49,300 --> 06:29:54,900
guys, sorry, but there, I don't understand guys. If only there was some way to, like,

4573
06:29:54,900 --> 06:30:03,060
truly know them, like, that cringe bit has been done. And if all the designs come out good, then...

4574
06:30:03,620 --> 06:30:15,700
Hmm. Then, uh, there's, there's no room at the end for a harp, for, for patting Jen too,

4575
06:30:15,700 --> 06:30:21,060
for harping. Where are we going this way? I'm late. I'm taking your guys' lead. Do we know where

4576
06:30:21,060 --> 06:30:30,740
we're going? Are we all confused? If we're just, if we're just going and venturing, I was just gonna

4577
06:30:30,740 --> 06:30:36,820
follow this path down to wherever this is over here. Uh, so we would need to go like south. Oh no,

4578
06:30:36,820 --> 06:30:42,980
we've got a torch. We have a torch. Boys, we have our heading. Then landing, then landing. Underground.

4579
06:30:46,260 --> 06:30:47,860
Fancy underground.

4580
06:30:51,780 --> 06:30:56,260
Harpy girl, do it. Yeah. No hands, just little wings, I think so.

4581
06:30:57,060 --> 06:31:01,780
For me, it's a harpy. That'd be dumb.

4582
06:31:04,100 --> 06:31:09,700
I like how we all agree the torch carrier leads the way. It's like the best way to do it. Just be

4583
06:31:09,700 --> 06:31:13,460
like, right, whoever gets the torch knows exactly where they're taking me. Whoever doesn't, like,

4584
06:31:13,460 --> 06:31:18,100
if you don't have one, then we're all just kind of following. I hear a cry.

4585
06:31:18,980 --> 06:31:28,020
That poor guy. Is he in torture? Oh, well, you put him out of his misery, didn't you?

4586
06:31:31,540 --> 06:31:40,740
Reefling, no! What did you do? I got a shattered stone talisman. Wait, so we're not to go that way.

4587
06:31:40,740 --> 06:31:46,180
Reefling, no! Did you just launch yourself off the map?

4588
06:31:50,180 --> 06:31:56,260
Make the harpy to chop it fly. Um, we've got a new body tape and...

4589
06:31:58,020 --> 06:31:59,780
Well, I've asked for it.

4590
06:32:04,820 --> 06:32:05,540
Are you done here?

4591
06:32:10,740 --> 06:32:17,300
Whoa. Oh. Oh. You went out of bounds so the game didn't let you.

4592
06:32:20,180 --> 06:32:20,980
All my ankles.

4593
06:32:24,980 --> 06:32:30,580
Huh? None of us can go down. Oh, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave to get me down.

4594
06:32:31,140 --> 06:32:37,940
And yeah, there's a new body tape in Gen 2 that you ain't really at.

4595
06:32:38,980 --> 06:32:43,940
Wait, so, does other refling have to leave as well? I think so.

4596
06:32:48,980 --> 06:32:51,300
Okay, other refling, sorry, you're gonna have to leave too.

4597
06:32:51,460 --> 06:32:53,460
Hmm.

4598
06:32:58,900 --> 06:33:08,820
Sorry, other refling. The game's a bit funny like that. I slipped. Okay, now I can progress.

4599
06:33:08,820 --> 06:33:13,780
Any problem? Let's see.

4600
06:33:24,580 --> 06:33:29,540
I feel like human, whatever that is. I'm not touching a dime is not worth it. I need to think.

4601
06:33:31,460 --> 06:33:32,020
I hear it.

4602
06:33:32,020 --> 06:33:41,300
I hear something looking. I'm just trying to figure out where to go. Have fun. It's a long way down.

4603
06:33:41,300 --> 06:33:43,220
Well, I hope you're ready for a freaking marathon.

4604
06:33:46,180 --> 06:33:48,900
I'm just trying to see if I can find a save station before we go down.

4605
06:33:50,740 --> 06:33:52,660
Are you squidding me right now? I...

4606
06:33:53,780 --> 06:33:58,980
Doctor just diagnosed me with a terminal case of strontism. There's no cure,

4607
06:33:58,980 --> 06:34:02,820
but I was told watching your streams will ease the pain in the meantime.

4608
06:34:03,460 --> 06:34:09,220
So really, it all works out for me. Thank you, tiny, tiny. Thank you for the tip as well.

4609
06:34:12,980 --> 06:34:16,980
First off, east, then west.

4610
06:34:25,620 --> 06:34:26,420
Enemy ahead.

4611
06:34:26,660 --> 06:34:28,660
Enemy ahead. No enemy ahead.

4612
06:34:37,060 --> 06:34:43,060
You get appraised. You are good. No enemy ahead. Good. Thank you for telling me.

4613
06:34:43,060 --> 06:34:50,900
Yeah? You get appraised. Good. What do you say? Yes, good, good, good. Everyone be nice.

4614
06:34:50,980 --> 06:34:54,100
Good, good, good. Seek behind, so to speak.

4615
06:34:55,940 --> 06:35:00,340
It's so interesting how cryptic we have to be. Oh, you can raid Torrent here.

4616
06:35:09,300 --> 06:35:13,620
We have to be quiet. No cure, but why would we want one?

4617
06:35:13,620 --> 06:35:24,660
I don't need no cure. I should stay a flicker if I can't for sure.

4618
06:35:26,340 --> 06:35:26,980
Don't you dare.

4619
06:35:27,780 --> 06:35:29,780
Oh, the good.

4620
06:35:52,340 --> 06:35:55,860
I am there, so I actually don't want to go there. I want to drop down

4621
06:35:56,980 --> 06:36:00,500
and run away like mad, and then come back.

4622
06:36:04,100 --> 06:36:08,980
Okay, I can do this. I can...

4623
06:36:11,540 --> 06:36:14,020
Yeah, talk about the AI knowing where you are.

4624
06:36:16,260 --> 06:36:21,140
If you're coming over, poke me. They look really tall as well.

4625
06:36:21,140 --> 06:36:30,180
Okay. Okay, let's do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. At least let me go. At least let me go.

4626
06:36:30,180 --> 06:36:37,460
At least let me go off. It wasn't even off. My Pintas. My Pintas. My Pintas has been jorking.

4627
06:36:38,820 --> 06:36:42,660
My Pintas is jorking. Oh, please, a safe site.

4628
06:36:43,620 --> 06:36:50,180
No. No safe site. No safe site. No safe site. Where is the safe site?

4629
06:36:50,820 --> 06:36:54,980
Oh my god, something's going to bite my ass. She's climbing up this. Oh my god.

4630
06:36:56,900 --> 06:37:01,300
Moeheart's pumping. I honestly can't play. This is literally a horror game without

4631
06:37:01,300 --> 06:37:05,620
Refling. I'm sorry. This is like, oh, why don't you play horror games? This is a horror game.

4632
06:37:05,620 --> 06:37:10,260
Whenever a Refling has to get like, freaking despawned out. Sorry, this is a horror game.

4633
06:37:11,060 --> 06:37:19,220
I can't do it on my own. I'm too scared. Oh, thank god. That's what I want to see, baby.

4634
06:37:19,220 --> 06:37:25,380
Bonnie Village. I mean, let's see, look at that Bonnie. It's a bit rundown if you ask me.

4635
06:37:26,500 --> 06:37:36,820
Poke me. Wait. I can't summon. I can't summon. I genuinely won't let me summon you.

4636
06:37:36,820 --> 06:37:43,380
Of course, I can't summon here. There must be a fucking boss fight or some fish.

4637
06:37:49,620 --> 06:37:55,140
There's gonna, there's a lot of death here. You? Is that why there's a lot of death? Because of you?

4638
06:37:55,780 --> 06:38:02,100
Yeah, you're like an actual NPC. You've been named into- The bridge is a lie. The bridge is a lie.

4639
06:38:02,900 --> 06:38:08,820
Why is the bridge a lie? Poke me. Okay, this bridge isn't a lie. Get me out here. I'm gone.

4640
06:38:09,380 --> 06:38:13,620
Then you have to ask me twice. I'm outie. I'm outie 5000 or whatever.

4641
06:38:14,580 --> 06:38:20,580
Not the clock fluff and the wood of the bridge. Then you have to ask me twice. I'm no hanging

4642
06:38:20,580 --> 06:38:25,780
a boot. I've got no business around these parts when I've no got my refunds with me. I've got

4643
06:38:25,780 --> 06:38:40,500
a knee business all. Please tell me. No, I don't want to go back in a cave. Please tell me. Please tell

4644
06:38:40,500 --> 06:38:49,300
me. Oh, please. Why would it be a cave? Because Torrent can't be in caves. Why would it be a cave?

4645
06:38:49,540 --> 06:38:57,220
Oh, for goodness' gravy. Oh, I'm sitting the fuck down so Scorpion's gonna come back. Like,

4646
06:38:57,220 --> 06:39:05,300
are they literally gonna come flying down that entrance? I see. We bam. No. Get away. Get away.

4647
06:39:05,300 --> 06:39:10,180
Let me sit down. Let me sit down. Let me reset them. Oh, the coconut's in here. Wait, I accidentally

4648
06:39:10,180 --> 06:39:14,900
came to the coconut cave? Honestly? Yeah.

4649
06:39:22,180 --> 06:39:25,460
Isn't that one footsteps right here and I keep thinking it's an enemy? Okay,

4650
06:39:25,460 --> 06:39:33,460
we flings. We're in a cave called Bonnie Goal. If you accidentally stumble upon it,

4651
06:39:33,460 --> 06:39:39,220
you do it by accidentally being in Bonnie Village and then panicking and going across the bridge.

4652
06:39:39,940 --> 06:39:44,980
And then go past the two scorpions and you get to go. Oh, the map's getting bigger.

4653
06:39:48,500 --> 06:39:50,740
Okay, I got one refling to come help me.

4654
06:39:53,460 --> 06:40:02,580
I put you on the explode. Oh, I heard a new one. Oh, wait, I didn't come. I got set. Oh,

4655
06:40:02,580 --> 06:40:07,300
no, I didn't come in there. I'm gonna sneeze. Mom, if you're gonna have to ask

4656
06:40:07,300 --> 06:40:13,380
you to fill, well, fill this. Is that? Wait, I think I'm gonna sneeze.

4657
06:40:37,380 --> 06:40:43,620
Oh, she can sleep in the garden where she can come in there and listen to me ramble

4658
06:40:43,620 --> 06:40:47,380
with a magazine. She cries and then she doesn't come in the room. Hold on.

4659
06:40:47,380 --> 06:41:15,940
Are you lying down? Are we doing the blessing even in the covering?

4660
06:41:17,460 --> 06:41:17,940
Ah.

4661
06:41:23,460 --> 06:41:28,260
I need that coconut. Wait, let me do my little ritual. Not the nine and a half second.

4662
06:41:37,300 --> 06:41:41,700
Got you whimpering. Got you quivering. Oh, did you get the pull back?

4663
06:41:42,580 --> 06:41:49,940
What? Okay, who's in? Set us in and slump and go in. And then pineapples and add...

4664
06:41:52,100 --> 06:41:57,540
Is that your, you know, your firework? And then pineapples and adversary.

4665
06:41:59,780 --> 06:42:01,540
It doesn't really count if you're an adversary.

4666
06:42:05,460 --> 06:42:10,100
Okay, let's just go exploring though. We're not gonna stop us exploring the world together again.

4667
06:42:10,340 --> 06:42:18,260
Oh, have I got my light on the hip? I do have my light on the hip. Okay, let's go. What is in here?

4668
06:42:21,940 --> 06:42:25,460
Danny across will bolt those guys so they like explode.

4669
06:42:29,620 --> 06:42:32,340
They look like exploders. Are you gonna blow off the map?

4670
06:42:32,340 --> 06:42:41,380
Holy moley. Whose item?

4671
06:42:44,980 --> 06:42:52,180
Is it too much whimpering? There's an item up there. Read message. If only I had a horse.

4672
06:42:54,580 --> 06:42:59,060
So I've just been through it. Well, Gimli's inside. That's all the mouse. I'll let her go

4673
06:42:59,060 --> 06:43:06,740
back outside again. Come push me to change the line. I spank you. Oh no, I'm sorry I let you

4674
06:43:06,740 --> 06:43:12,900
get hurt. Oh no, my replaying. Get away, you weirdo. Only I'm allowed to kiss them like that.

4675
06:43:14,100 --> 06:43:22,980
Sheesh. Open this door. I'll open this door. Oh, I got bolts though. Opening.

4676
06:43:23,780 --> 06:43:31,940
What? Oh my god, I'm getting freaking grabbed. Oh my god, they did some mad damage.

4677
06:43:36,580 --> 06:43:42,900
Oh, let me heal. Let me heal. I need to heal up a little bit. I need whimpering all through the cavern.

4678
06:43:43,620 --> 06:43:45,620
Hmm.

4679
06:43:49,860 --> 06:43:51,620
Oh, I was gonna say, I can hear that guy whimpering.

4680
06:43:55,220 --> 06:43:57,140
Here are whimpers. What's down here?

4681
06:43:58,820 --> 06:44:00,820
Hi!

4682
06:44:01,060 --> 06:44:08,180
Hey, you guys are taking me this way. I can't do anything about it.

4683
06:44:14,900 --> 06:44:21,220
I was gonna say, something's gonna drop. It just feels like a drop. Whoa, their health, they're so big.

4684
06:44:23,460 --> 06:44:25,700
Is there even a point of whack in these guys?

4685
06:44:25,860 --> 06:44:38,340
Will we just move on? Oh, sorry, replaying. Bruh, these guys are so strong. I need to put

4686
06:44:38,340 --> 06:44:49,700
bleed damage on my bleed, I think. I can't believe it. I need to level up. My weapons have been

4687
06:44:49,700 --> 06:44:51,700
proven right.

4688
06:44:56,020 --> 06:44:58,500
These things are weird looking. What are they called?

4689
06:45:02,180 --> 06:45:07,860
Will we just move on? This is terrible. Right, move on. This is taking too long. I give up.

4690
06:45:09,780 --> 06:45:16,100
I give up. They're taking too long. Oh, there's more of them. Right, turn back, turn back. Oh no!

4691
06:45:16,980 --> 06:45:28,340
Oh my god. Are you gonna make it? Are you alive? Hold on. Don't let them grab you. Whatever you do.

4692
06:45:29,540 --> 06:45:35,140
We must go back. Oh god, was it this way we came? I can't. I don't know. Oh, there's more. There's more.

4693
06:45:36,500 --> 06:45:37,940
Watch out, replaying. Watch out.

4694
06:45:38,660 --> 06:45:46,420
Uh, whoa, whoa, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow. What's this? Is this a boss fight?

4695
06:45:49,060 --> 06:45:55,700
Oh, we've lost our other two, refling. Hold on, we need them to come. There you are.

4696
06:45:55,700 --> 06:45:58,740
Oh, there's an item back there. Oh, that was the item.

4697
06:46:00,980 --> 06:46:03,300
Right, right, we're jumping down the waterfall, I think.

4698
06:46:03,460 --> 06:46:14,100
Ready, steady, uh, oh wait, am I not to go there? You're blocking me.

4699
06:46:16,260 --> 06:46:21,620
Is that a no? I don't know if it's no. If you jump down, I'll jump down.

4700
06:46:26,020 --> 06:46:28,660
All right, you moan one more time. I'm taking that coconut off you.

4701
06:46:29,620 --> 06:46:35,140
Hey, give me that coconut. I'll be careful of the things from the ceiling, I guess.

4702
06:46:36,500 --> 06:46:45,220
I don't know. I'm looking around. Okay, there's Alexander, Alexander's cousin.

4703
06:46:46,900 --> 06:46:56,020
Do we need to? Oh, they break quite easily. Low poise. There's a lot of Alexander's in this room right now.

4704
06:46:59,620 --> 06:47:02,820
There's a little baby Alexander's too.

4705
06:47:06,580 --> 06:47:08,820
Take that, you aggressive stinky.

4706
06:47:11,220 --> 06:47:17,540
Oh, we're just absolutely obliterating them, to be honest. Oh my god, I love when they have

4707
06:47:17,540 --> 06:47:25,300
little poise so I can just keep planting them. My people. What, the paw? You're a paw? Are you

4708
06:47:25,300 --> 06:47:33,060
trying to tell me you're a pottery paw? A living jar-tard. He's just really emotional around you.

4709
06:47:33,060 --> 06:47:40,900
I kind of get it though. Yeah, I kind of feel that. Okay, let me grab this. I lost Ash of War. I know what

4710
06:47:40,900 --> 06:47:42,420
that does. I don't.

4711
06:47:49,060 --> 06:47:59,060
Okay. Look in their mind. I see an I am here. I'm, oh, it's those guys. What do they do? Oh,

4712
06:47:59,060 --> 06:48:03,540
what does he do? Oh, there's a light come. There's a guy over there.

4713
06:48:04,260 --> 06:48:11,940
Is he, so he doesn't explode? He just runs at you? Oh, like, there he is there in that paw.

4714
06:48:13,780 --> 06:48:16,900
There's something in it. Well, if he's asleep, we'll leave him.

4715
06:48:20,820 --> 06:48:27,380
This is a tough day for a pension. It's a jar warrior without his jar.

4716
06:48:28,340 --> 06:48:37,860
Oh, that's what Alexander looks like on the In-Saint. That is strange. I won't kill him. He's not aggressive.

4717
06:48:41,140 --> 06:48:48,980
Oh, they torch her dumb in here. Oh, that's not very nice. He's locked up. The jar lord now gets

4718
06:48:48,980 --> 06:48:57,540
kind of gross. Yeah, there's like an actual human inside it. Wait, is that harvestable? It is.

4719
06:49:07,060 --> 06:49:16,740
Yeah. Oh, you got spanked as well. Okay. I think Alexander has a handsome, powerful warrior inside

4720
06:49:16,740 --> 06:49:25,460
him. Hey, strange. I don't get it. Oh, honestly, the lore goes so deep in Elden Ring, but it's like

4721
06:49:25,460 --> 06:49:32,900
so nice that they made the thing, like, it's just so nice to get involved in such a strange lore.

4722
06:49:32,900 --> 06:49:37,540
I would say it's probably the strangest lore I can wrap my, like, try to wrap my head around.

4723
06:49:38,500 --> 06:49:40,500
Dianne?

4724
06:49:43,780 --> 06:49:48,580
Uh, we'll take the next one. You guys go on with that one.

4725
06:49:51,620 --> 06:49:53,540
All right, are you ready to read every one?

4726
06:49:55,780 --> 06:49:57,780
Wait.

4727
06:49:58,180 --> 06:50:00,180
Uh...

4728
06:50:00,180 --> 06:50:02,180
Oh.

4729
06:50:12,580 --> 06:50:17,620
Okay. I was like, oh, we done messed up. We done...

4730
06:50:20,260 --> 06:50:24,500
I think there's three different types of jars, prisoners, warriors, and like an actual jar.

4731
06:50:26,420 --> 06:50:28,420
Hello.

4732
06:50:29,380 --> 06:50:31,380
Mr. Jar?

4733
06:50:36,580 --> 06:50:38,580
Is it the weight of jumping on it?

4734
06:50:43,460 --> 06:50:46,260
Huh? You want to jump down on it?

4735
06:50:48,660 --> 06:50:50,660
Maybe like, we as bones?

4736
06:50:53,380 --> 06:50:55,380
What?

4737
06:50:56,180 --> 06:50:58,180
Huh.

4738
06:50:58,420 --> 06:51:00,420
Let's try that again.

4739
06:51:04,900 --> 06:51:11,940
Oh, no! Reefling! I'm sorry! Okay, you need to do a big jump on it, uh, Raider Reefling, and then it'll let you on.

4740
06:51:17,860 --> 06:51:21,140
Oh, god, it goes so high when it does. I can't even see it when it goes that high.

4741
06:51:21,940 --> 06:51:23,940
I need to like, back off and like, look up.

4742
06:51:24,500 --> 06:51:27,940
Okay, Raider Reefling. Okay, it's coming back down.

4743
06:51:28,900 --> 06:51:33,060
Just do like, a big jump on it, and then your weight should carry it down. Oh, you're already on it!

4744
06:51:41,140 --> 06:51:42,660
Reefling?

4745
06:51:42,660 --> 06:51:44,660
Invader Reefling, did?

4746
06:51:44,820 --> 06:51:46,820
Did you mean that, or...

4747
06:51:47,380 --> 06:51:49,380
it forward jumped me?

4748
06:51:50,340 --> 06:51:52,900
I wonder if because your instance is an anime.

4749
06:51:54,340 --> 06:51:56,340
Oh!

4750
06:51:56,740 --> 06:52:00,500
What would be my version if I had a coconut? What would I make my coconut say?

4751
06:52:01,940 --> 06:52:03,940
If I could get one in-game?

4752
06:52:04,900 --> 06:52:06,900
I'd just look ink on me.

4753
06:52:06,980 --> 06:52:10,020
Ink for me, and everyone's like, what?

4754
06:52:12,260 --> 06:52:15,220
Wow! I'm beating them up! I'm beating them up!

4755
06:52:20,260 --> 06:52:22,260
Good, Reefling.

4756
06:52:22,500 --> 06:52:24,500
Like this?

4757
06:52:25,460 --> 06:52:28,740
Wait, we were gonna have to do this whole dungeon if we mess this up?

4758
06:52:30,500 --> 06:52:35,860
It's not exactly a fast dungeon to get back. Oh, there is. Sorry, here is. Okay, we're gonna be using this a lot.

4759
06:52:37,300 --> 06:52:39,300
Are you ready?

4760
06:52:40,100 --> 06:52:42,820
Are you steady? Do you need a kiss of courage?

4761
06:52:43,380 --> 06:52:48,100
Kiss of courage. Kiss of courage, right? I don't know what's behind us. Let's find out.

4762
06:52:48,500 --> 06:52:52,500
Okay, okay, okay.

4763
06:52:59,940 --> 06:53:01,940
Huh?

4764
06:53:02,100 --> 06:53:04,420
My auto lock doesn't auto lock onto the enemy.

4765
06:53:04,980 --> 06:53:09,700
I'm gonna start swinging. I'm gonna start swinging off in this bitch. I'm gonna start swinging! I'm swinging!

4766
06:53:10,660 --> 06:53:12,660
I'm doing it!

4767
06:53:13,380 --> 06:53:15,380
How the fuck can you see them?

4768
06:53:16,180 --> 06:53:18,180
Oh, I...

4769
06:53:22,180 --> 06:53:28,180
Am I going crazy or is it just my screen? I'm losing it. What the fuck?

4770
06:53:33,140 --> 06:53:38,500
Oh, I hit it! I actually got hit! Oh, I'm dead! I'm dead! Hold on. Sorry, I'm getting overzealous.

4771
06:53:46,100 --> 06:53:51,940
Uh, how are you guys doing this? Are you just guessing? They must be guessing.

4772
06:53:53,940 --> 06:53:58,020
They go in this... Okay, right. As long as I wasn't absolutely losing it, I was like,

4773
06:53:58,020 --> 06:54:01,460
how do you guys know where to swing? Because they were just hitting, hitting, hitting, constantly.

4774
06:54:06,740 --> 06:54:13,940
We did it! We did it! So, is there like any secret for them? Or is this just one of them bosses to do?

4775
06:54:14,740 --> 06:54:19,300
I remember some sister actually did a series where she kills all the Elden Ring bosses.

4776
06:54:19,300 --> 06:54:24,660
I'm curious if she'll do the DLC run as well. I don't know if she'll do it anytime soon, but

4777
06:54:26,180 --> 06:54:30,180
uh, that was the lamest boss, which I can even see her!

4778
06:54:31,140 --> 06:54:36,660
I'm gonna start swinging my sword around like, I can swing my sword, son! You cannot afford sword!

4779
06:54:37,620 --> 06:54:42,260
I can't call you the not Bonnie Village.

4780
06:54:42,820 --> 06:54:48,420
Did I need to kill that red NPC? Or was there something I could do?

4781
06:54:49,140 --> 06:55:00,180
Right, so that's where I've been. Let's run.

4782
06:55:07,300 --> 06:55:11,460
I do like how Torrent is so down. He's like, what? You want me to ride this house? Sure.

4783
06:55:12,420 --> 06:55:15,060
Like Torrent, you're actually like, listen to me so well.

4784
06:55:19,540 --> 06:55:27,700
Me keeping myself safe from enemies like, right. Oh, well, close enough. And of course they all get

4785
06:55:27,700 --> 06:55:34,180
activated. Wait, so can I not, is that bridge open for business or not?

4786
06:55:34,180 --> 06:55:34,900
Oh.

4787
06:55:39,060 --> 06:55:46,020
There we go. Right, now what? Oh, I'm still not over. Wait, what? Am I just taking a really obtuse

4788
06:55:46,020 --> 06:55:51,380
way to try and get Kroa? Wait, I was a little too right in there.

4789
06:55:56,260 --> 06:55:57,460
Oh, it's a dead snip.

4790
06:55:57,620 --> 06:56:10,580
Sick. There's something here. Oh, mother. Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child

4791
06:56:10,580 --> 06:56:16,500
unto me. The sins of being worthy must be cut. I look like the bridge was broken. I might be

4792
06:56:16,500 --> 06:56:23,380
fucking right. See, the bridge isn't broken and I'm just blind. Why did I think it was broken?

4793
06:56:27,540 --> 06:56:38,020
I don't know. For some reason I thought the bridge was broken. No, it's not. Wait,

4794
06:56:38,980 --> 06:56:44,100
I think I might have just like completely had a, I don't know, loss of focus then because I

4795
06:56:44,100 --> 06:56:52,900
could have sworn this was like both. Silence, my brother. Hello. I can't tell you.

4796
06:56:53,860 --> 06:57:02,980
For pity's sake, your place is in the jar. Night, sainthood itself awaits you within.

4797
06:57:02,980 --> 06:57:08,260
For shamans like you, this is your lot, life where you accorded for this alone.

4798
06:57:11,460 --> 06:57:14,420
The whipping. I can whip my refunds.

4799
06:57:14,500 --> 06:57:22,260
Which, I'm curious. It's still not a save station. Is that one over there though?

4800
06:57:23,540 --> 06:57:30,340
Oh, cheeky little summoning. The jar was made for me. You're going in the jar.

4801
06:57:31,060 --> 06:57:36,580
Oh, my freaking every market stuff is on the way. I'm so excited. I can't wait.

4802
06:57:36,580 --> 06:57:39,940
I can wait. Safety, yes.

4803
06:57:44,100 --> 06:57:47,380
Heard her getting the draw refund. Is there anything I can do to level up the line?

4804
06:57:49,300 --> 06:57:49,620
No.

4805
06:57:52,340 --> 06:57:58,580
Uh, no. Okay. There is one thing important. Again, I can't summon.

4806
06:57:58,580 --> 06:58:08,740
I'm not going to fucking make it. I'm not going to make it. Actually, not going to make it unironically.

4807
06:58:10,740 --> 06:58:15,860
Freaking plain horror game simulator out here. Okay, there's an enemy there. That's fine.

4808
06:58:16,500 --> 06:58:20,980
Keep her going. Keep her going. Hey, thank you. Great. Selfish.

4809
06:58:21,940 --> 06:58:25,540
Okay, just follow the road and I will do a natural.

4810
06:58:27,540 --> 06:58:33,300
Why? Why did it make that noise? What was that noise? Am I going crazier? Did I just hear like a squeal?

4811
06:58:38,820 --> 06:58:47,700
No, I grew. No, I grew. No, I grew. No, I grew. No, I grew. Get up, Torrin. Get up right now.

4812
06:58:51,380 --> 06:59:00,500
Torrin, what are you doing? This is just a cliff. This cliff doesn't provide safety, Torrin.

4813
06:59:01,700 --> 06:59:10,420
Torrin, you lied to me. Torrin, please. No. Oh, well, you know that's good enough.

4814
06:59:10,420 --> 06:59:12,180
Good enough. Good enough. Get up by hell. Get up by hell.

4815
06:59:13,140 --> 06:59:17,940
And heal. And get up by hell.

4816
06:59:17,940 --> 06:59:26,180
Oh, Torrin. Oh, Torrin. Oh, Torrin. Oh, you came and you gave me a ride.

4817
06:59:27,460 --> 06:59:39,540
Away from the fire demon. Oh, Torrin. Oh, please tell me I can summon you here.

4818
06:59:39,620 --> 06:59:45,540
My heart can't take much more of this. Okay, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down,

4819
06:59:45,540 --> 06:59:49,700
sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, not the fire. No, do not heal.

4820
06:59:49,700 --> 06:59:56,020
Sit down at the fire. I can see them literally in the distance approaching. Everyone reset.

4821
06:59:57,860 --> 07:00:07,460
Everyone reset. Again, no fucking summon. Okay, if I take a left, I come to this area.

4822
07:00:08,420 --> 07:00:15,780
Um, sure. If I take a left in this arch, I come to a house. Surely I can spawn the

4823
07:00:15,780 --> 07:00:29,380
reeflings in a fucking house. Why are you blue? What is wrong with you? Oh, it's gravestones.

4824
07:00:29,380 --> 07:00:39,860
Okay. Oh, no, those are those guys that do those rapid succession attacks.

4825
07:00:41,780 --> 07:00:45,300
Oh my god, it's like an actual church.

4826
07:00:46,020 --> 07:01:01,620
Why did you please for the love of god do not spawn a boss like right now? Please just let me

4827
07:01:01,620 --> 07:01:09,060
get the grace. Please just let me get the grace. Please. Okay, I don't think anything's attacking me.

4828
07:01:09,940 --> 07:01:16,580
The church doesn't allow summon again. I'm not going to make it my heart.

4829
07:01:17,620 --> 07:01:21,940
Literally not going to make it right. So what's so important about this church if there's no enemies

4830
07:01:21,940 --> 07:01:26,580
here? Is it lower? Please be a lower church. So I don't actually have to think.

4831
07:01:27,300 --> 07:01:34,340
A resource gathering church?

4832
07:01:39,300 --> 07:01:40,660
I hear an enemy that's something.

4833
07:01:42,900 --> 07:01:50,420
Put marker on the black castello. This? No. Oh, this? I'm about to do like a massive underground

4834
07:01:50,420 --> 07:01:51,460
right turn to this.

4835
07:01:57,300 --> 07:01:57,940
To the left.

4836
07:02:04,340 --> 07:02:07,540
I'm not being fucking dumb. This thing down here, you want me to go down?

4837
07:02:12,020 --> 07:02:14,020
Me listening to the enemy get closer to me.

4838
07:02:16,420 --> 07:02:20,980
Don't go right. Just go down and take a left and then whatever happens in here happens.

4839
07:02:21,540 --> 07:02:23,140
I assume just go dead ahead then.

4840
07:02:25,780 --> 07:02:27,940
No reefing for five minutes and she's Parisian.

4841
07:02:29,620 --> 07:02:32,660
I can literally hear an enemy stalking this type of thing.

4842
07:02:35,620 --> 07:02:37,700
I'm just going to go north and let the wind take me.

4843
07:02:41,620 --> 07:02:44,260
What's patrolling the church is my question.

4844
07:02:44,260 --> 07:02:58,580
Is it a turtle? Did I get scared by a turtle?

4845
07:03:00,580 --> 07:03:03,700
Honestly, probably. Dog. Behold the dog.

4846
07:03:15,220 --> 07:03:17,620
Oh, it's frogs in the water.

4847
07:03:21,460 --> 07:03:25,460
Oh, something perished. I don't know what, but no problem there.

4848
07:03:27,780 --> 07:03:34,660
Wow. Is it a downward path and everything? Oh, is it that I'm supposed to take? Like all the

4849
07:03:34,660 --> 07:03:37,140
way down here and then get up to here? I'm so dumb.

4850
07:03:38,740 --> 07:03:40,260
I am so dumb.

4851
07:03:41,220 --> 07:03:48,740
Okay, don't go down there. Okay, just go straight ahead. I go north and let the path take me.

4852
07:03:50,340 --> 07:03:51,860
Take me path. Take me.

4853
07:03:57,700 --> 07:03:59,860
Oh, Tarn, you're such a brave boy.

4854
07:04:01,540 --> 07:04:03,380
You are. You are my noble goat.

4855
07:04:04,340 --> 07:04:08,420
Turn left once you hit a wall. Hard to hit the wall, I'm afraid.

4856
07:04:11,220 --> 07:04:16,020
I'm going for it. Like a wall down here? Take a lift.

4857
07:04:23,860 --> 07:04:25,140
This buddy looks like it.

4858
07:04:30,500 --> 07:04:32,420
I'm fucking terrified.

4859
07:04:36,020 --> 07:04:38,020
I'm not going to lie. I'm shitting myself.

4860
07:04:40,660 --> 07:04:49,860
The fact that I'm actually allowed to raid Torn and then inside. Oh, it's happening.

4861
07:04:52,180 --> 07:04:57,300
Oh, thank God. Oh, please, please let this be the one.

4862
07:04:58,660 --> 07:05:06,980
Oh, thank the maker. I can't do that anymore. It's called Church District Entrance.

4863
07:05:07,460 --> 07:05:11,460
God, I feel like I need to pee myself in fear.

4864
07:05:12,820 --> 07:05:17,940
Jace, Louise, what are we looking at? I'll show you guys come in.

4865
07:05:19,300 --> 07:05:21,860
There's crabs on the roof. It's flooded.

4866
07:05:22,820 --> 07:05:36,660
I hope it's all. Oh, refunds. I've never been happier to see you in a nightmare.

4867
07:05:38,100 --> 07:05:43,380
The peeler allegations. Literally, I feel like peeing in fear. I cannot handle this game alone.

4868
07:05:43,380 --> 07:05:48,340
It's too scary. Everything coming at me at once. I can't handle it.

4869
07:05:52,580 --> 07:06:00,420
Okay, I've got my rival in already.

4870
07:06:02,740 --> 07:06:08,260
Wait, you got this? Okay, and then any con? I don't know how many reeflings are here.

4871
07:06:08,260 --> 07:06:12,100
I feel like we're getting caught with the DLC with each other.

4872
07:06:12,660 --> 07:06:17,140
I gave you a 24-hour head start. I won't hear any allegations. I didn't give you guys help.

4873
07:06:17,940 --> 07:06:21,620
She says that she has like a billion rinses her name.

4874
07:06:24,980 --> 07:06:27,380
It's not gonna be scared about except scary monsters.

4875
07:06:27,380 --> 07:06:30,340
Wait, strongy, join the peeler allegations.

4876
07:06:30,340 --> 07:06:32,900
No, the ball is in Azur's court.

4877
07:06:34,100 --> 07:06:37,540
The ball is in Azur's court. I'm actually going to go for a tenkel very quickly.

4878
07:06:37,540 --> 07:06:39,860
The toilet's right there. I'm literally going to be like a millisecond.

4879
07:08:17,140 --> 07:08:33,860
Are you squidding me right now?

4880
07:08:47,460 --> 07:09:16,500
Okay, good news is both babies are still in.

4881
07:09:16,500 --> 07:09:21,540
The bad news is I'm gonna have to leave the door open because...

4882
07:09:21,540 --> 07:09:22,900
Are you squidding me right now?

4883
07:09:24,100 --> 07:09:28,100
I think, oh my god, I tinkled all these kidney stones. It's not looking good for me.

4884
07:09:28,100 --> 07:09:29,300
Oh no, did someone time out?

4885
07:09:30,740 --> 07:09:34,420
Anya, what happened? Thank you, Dimsey Dan, and look...

4886
07:09:35,380 --> 07:09:39,380
Logo Dogo, I assume. Sorry, here's not being in.

4887
07:09:40,020 --> 07:09:42,500
Alessandro, you've just joined this area. I haven't, yeah.

4888
07:09:43,460 --> 07:09:46,580
I think Pineapple had two moments ago.

4889
07:09:47,140 --> 07:09:49,700
How did you guys disconnect? Did I do something wrong?

4890
07:09:51,060 --> 07:09:55,940
Yeah, I don't know what's gonna happen if they're gonna start screaming when they come in the room,

4891
07:09:55,940 --> 07:10:00,020
but don't be surprised if you hear some background yelling.

4892
07:10:03,060 --> 07:10:05,540
The AFG don't know who or just can't keep getting away with it.

4893
07:10:05,540 --> 07:10:07,780
I feel bad. I feel like I'm still getting exchanged.

4894
07:10:07,780 --> 07:10:12,100
I'd rather like an exchange of money and being like, ah, I've spent my money on this valuable

4895
07:10:12,500 --> 07:10:16,980
thing. Like, I get something out of it, and it's just like, oh, I went for a pee and I had to mute.

4896
07:10:16,980 --> 07:10:21,540
Like, I didn't do anything. What? I guess it was a disconnection.

4897
07:10:24,580 --> 07:10:29,140
Uh, right, what were the... Right, we've got Torchbearer, which is the good news.

4898
07:10:30,900 --> 07:10:33,220
Okay, big boy jump.

4899
07:10:37,220 --> 07:10:37,860
Big boy jump.

4900
07:10:43,220 --> 07:10:49,380
Riefling. We didn't even get started.

4901
07:10:52,740 --> 07:10:53,700
Riefling.

4902
07:10:56,180 --> 07:11:01,140
The amount of time gravity is... It's probably the lag, honestly.

4903
07:11:01,140 --> 07:11:03,700
Wait, what did I do? Jump off this bit.

4904
07:11:04,420 --> 07:11:20,580
Wow. Okay, uh, ignore enemies, I guess? Oh, do you need help? Oh, they just, like,

4905
07:11:20,580 --> 07:11:23,940
asked the load. Okay, it's fine. Wow.

4906
07:11:24,100 --> 07:11:29,700
Are they gonna explode? I'm pushing boost.

4907
07:11:31,460 --> 07:11:35,540
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. What are you doing?

4908
07:11:37,620 --> 07:11:41,860
I guess I can just ignore them. Right, I'm ignoring them. Don't grab me when I walk past you.

4909
07:11:41,860 --> 07:11:49,620
Don't make myself clear. If enemies don't get me, they just want to... Oh, God, it's one of these guys.

4910
07:11:50,500 --> 07:11:53,540
No! Enough!

4911
07:11:57,780 --> 07:12:00,100
Fuck your poise, you're a shit poise, honestly.

4912
07:12:02,820 --> 07:12:04,020
As if that hit me.

4913
07:12:12,900 --> 07:12:15,300
I'll stand here to heal very much, so here, here, here.

4914
07:12:15,860 --> 07:12:20,500
I like those enemies over there are active on us, and they're like,

4915
07:12:20,500 --> 07:12:22,500
what do we do, man? I can't reach them.

4916
07:12:24,740 --> 07:12:27,540
If the cats aren't coming in the room, I'm actually gonna force them to.

4917
07:12:27,780 --> 07:12:29,780
Okay.

4918
07:12:37,780 --> 07:12:41,780
Right, you can eat inside by cat the same.

4919
07:12:41,780 --> 07:12:43,780
Wow.

4920
07:12:43,780 --> 07:12:47,780
He looks really good, don't you look, you're moving all the way out there.

4921
07:12:47,780 --> 07:12:51,780
He looks like all the way out there, my odd-eaten.

4922
07:12:52,580 --> 07:12:54,580
Wow.

4923
07:12:54,580 --> 07:12:59,700
And if we're again, if you're still in this room and I have no idea not to get up again, you're being

4924
07:12:59,700 --> 07:13:08,820
perished. Right, gentlemen, we have our heading. Anyone been to the cat combs yet? No.

4925
07:13:11,140 --> 07:13:14,180
Uh, right, okay, we just run. There's no jump needed here.

4926
07:13:16,820 --> 07:13:18,820
There.

4927
07:13:22,500 --> 07:13:26,820
Why did the ground start shaking? We're supposed to make that jump.

4928
07:13:30,500 --> 07:13:32,580
I was gonna say, are you sure, but...

4929
07:13:36,340 --> 07:13:39,780
There's an item here. Hey, is that summoning thing?

4930
07:13:42,180 --> 07:13:46,100
It is. Wait, you guys can summon ahead like this?

4931
07:13:46,900 --> 07:13:49,620
I thought it had to be a summoning, am I being gummy?

4932
07:13:52,660 --> 07:13:57,540
I didn't know I did that. I thought it had to be like...

4933
07:14:00,020 --> 07:14:02,660
Well, I don't know.

4934
07:14:06,740 --> 07:14:11,220
The trees are shattering in the water. Why? Environmental things?

4935
07:14:17,940 --> 07:14:19,460
Is there something in the water?

4936
07:14:22,660 --> 07:14:25,060
Oh, god, am I gonna make it?

4937
07:14:26,740 --> 07:14:32,660
Oh, okay. I don't know if the leafling can spawn. I don't think you timed out.

4938
07:14:37,220 --> 07:14:46,660
What is making that noise? Is it just ambience and it just sends a bit? Oh, god. Oh, okay.

4939
07:14:52,420 --> 07:15:02,100
As long as the boss is in defeat, I can get you guys in. Man, who made the DLC? They literally,

4940
07:15:02,100 --> 07:15:04,500
whoever made that decision, made the wrong choice.

4941
07:15:11,300 --> 07:15:13,220
Wait. Oh, no, I can't get you in.

4942
07:15:16,420 --> 07:15:17,940
There is a symbol right here.

4943
07:15:18,500 --> 07:15:27,940
No head ahead. I mean, I guess. There is a symbol right here and it's gone.

4944
07:15:32,340 --> 07:15:36,420
Need you to... You need another summon thing to summon the red...

4945
07:15:36,420 --> 07:15:42,260
Oh, I keep forgetting that. Sorry. I keep going like, oh, I don't want invaded, so I'll just get

4946
07:15:43,220 --> 07:15:46,580
the invader in first, but I keep bringing out races, basically.

4947
07:15:48,900 --> 07:15:50,100
Oh, no.

4948
07:15:56,260 --> 07:16:02,900
That looks right, right? Okay, that looks right. And then jump.

4949
07:16:04,820 --> 07:16:06,820
I don't even know how we did that. I'm gonna go on a...

4950
07:16:09,140 --> 07:16:12,820
A little bit full damage. What are you? Oh, yo, we have crustacean.

4951
07:16:13,700 --> 07:16:17,220
I like how the crabs don't bother you, really. Yeah, do we want...

4952
07:16:18,420 --> 07:16:20,500
It's over there. I don't know. There's a door over there.

4953
07:16:25,460 --> 07:16:34,740
Whoa. Oh, it's one of these bams. Fuck you. Shit poise. Take that. Yeah, you ain't got no poise.

4954
07:16:37,220 --> 07:16:40,420
Me, when the enemy has absolutely no poise, I can't stand a chance against my

4955
07:16:40,980 --> 07:16:42,260
two-handed blade.

4956
07:16:44,900 --> 07:16:48,660
Me, fuck. What was that?

4957
07:17:01,300 --> 07:17:04,020
Wow. I even had jambon to light the way.

4958
07:17:04,020 --> 07:17:10,340
Okay. I almost didn't jump. I'm gonna be honest. I got so distracted.

4959
07:17:13,540 --> 07:17:14,340
I'm helping him.

4960
07:17:22,340 --> 07:17:26,980
Actually, give me them hefty bones. I think we're going up.

4961
07:17:27,300 --> 07:17:33,540
Well, not in the water, since we can't swim, apparently.

4962
07:17:34,420 --> 07:17:37,700
Oh, a lever. Do you want me... Do you want to both go on it, and then I can push it?

4963
07:17:38,820 --> 07:17:43,300
And then you can see a woman's lifted you. I'm so strong, I can lift you both.

4964
07:17:46,260 --> 07:17:48,740
You really don't want to go on it? That was a long word.

4965
07:17:48,820 --> 07:17:56,900
Okay, I had to use all my strength for that one.

4966
07:17:58,980 --> 07:17:59,700
Causing.

4967
07:18:07,460 --> 07:18:11,380
A temple rises up from the water? Oh, no, a dream. Sorry, a dream.

4968
07:18:11,620 --> 07:18:16,980
Okay.

4969
07:18:24,900 --> 07:18:34,180
Just happened in dark circles one. Kind of a draining

4970
07:18:34,180 --> 07:18:44,180
This happened in Dark Souls 1, kind of a draining burn in the city.

4971
07:18:44,180 --> 07:18:52,180
I like when it changes the environment, I have to admit.

4972
07:18:52,180 --> 07:19:03,180
The astronomical environmental changes are so good.

4973
07:19:03,180 --> 07:19:05,180
Wow!

4974
07:19:05,180 --> 07:19:09,180
Okay, so we can get this now?

4975
07:19:09,180 --> 07:19:12,180
We can go like down there.

4976
07:19:12,180 --> 07:19:19,180
Ah, it's drained, it's drained, okay.

4977
07:19:19,180 --> 07:19:28,180
It's gonna be funny if there's like a weight limit to these, and by the time the third reflin hit it, I would break and we're all like, uh...

4978
07:19:28,180 --> 07:19:30,180
It's charged!

4979
07:19:30,180 --> 07:19:33,180
Okay, we now have a church.

4980
07:19:33,180 --> 07:19:35,180
Here, yeah.

4981
07:19:35,180 --> 07:19:40,180
Yippee! We're safe, we're safe, we did it, we did it!

4982
07:19:40,180 --> 07:19:44,180
I don't know if anyone has unlocked this place.

4983
07:19:44,180 --> 07:19:49,180
Oh wait, I can't open up my menu because of the reflin, the radar reflin, hold on.

4984
07:19:49,180 --> 07:19:51,180
Ah, it really not letting me open up the menu.

4985
07:19:51,180 --> 07:19:54,180
Dude, I'm trying to show them where we are.

4986
07:19:54,180 --> 07:19:56,180
On the map.

4987
07:19:56,180 --> 07:20:01,180
Stop thinking I'm fighting, I'm not.

4988
07:20:01,180 --> 07:20:04,180
Ah, it won't let me open up the map to tell you what church I'm at.

4989
07:20:04,180 --> 07:20:07,180
Oh, but there's someone here that made it.

4990
07:20:07,180 --> 07:20:10,180
Shining!

4991
07:20:10,180 --> 07:20:15,180
It's because of Jewelfinger.

4992
07:20:15,180 --> 07:20:20,180
Had to drain a town to fight a boss called the Four Kings, and Dragonsouls won.

4993
07:20:20,180 --> 07:20:24,180
On it, Dragonsouls, Dark Souls won.

4994
07:20:24,180 --> 07:20:29,180
Honestly, I wouldn't mind watching like a lore, like someone playing the game.

4995
07:20:29,180 --> 07:20:33,180
It's definitely one of those games where I can't watch it.

4996
07:20:33,180 --> 07:20:35,180
Eh, sorry, I can't play it, but I can watch it.

4997
07:20:35,180 --> 07:20:38,180
Okay, I have two reflings now, so we're good to go again.

4998
07:20:38,180 --> 07:20:40,180
Where are we going?

4999
07:20:40,180 --> 07:20:43,180
Where are we going?

5000
07:20:43,180 --> 07:20:45,180
Let's check another one.

5001
07:20:45,180 --> 07:20:49,180
Any secrets, like big secrets or items that we've been needing?

5002
07:20:49,180 --> 07:20:52,180
I'd love to join, but I've got to prepare for work tomorrow.

5003
07:20:52,180 --> 07:20:54,180
I think this is the last spot I can access to the group.

5004
07:20:54,180 --> 07:20:56,180
Yes, no one, please don't worry.

5005
07:20:56,180 --> 07:21:00,180
If you need to rest, if you guys need to catch up on some stuff to do, please.

5006
07:21:00,180 --> 07:21:09,180
Uh, please do, sorry.

5007
07:21:09,180 --> 07:21:22,180
Please do your best to look after yourself and make sure you get your business sorted out.

5008
07:21:22,180 --> 07:21:26,180
Very good to get your business sorted out.

5009
07:21:26,180 --> 07:21:32,180
I will be streaming this tomorrow again.

5010
07:21:32,180 --> 07:21:36,180
I don't know how enjoyably we're going to make it.

5011
07:21:36,180 --> 07:21:44,180
Um, I'm starting to feel alright though, like I didn't feel the sickness I was earlier.

5012
07:21:44,180 --> 07:21:47,180
Oh, I don't know what the plan is with me.

5013
07:21:47,180 --> 07:21:49,180
Honestly, I'm falling apart.

5014
07:21:49,180 --> 07:21:53,180
The scenes and reforms you're just going to have to put me together again.

5015
07:21:53,180 --> 07:22:00,180
Fire Nate, you know, let's see what it says.

5016
07:22:00,180 --> 07:22:06,180
Um, what are you?

5017
07:22:06,180 --> 07:22:12,180
What are you?

5018
07:22:12,180 --> 07:22:16,180
Raises potency of kicking and stomping.

5019
07:22:16,180 --> 07:22:19,180
I mean, considering it being shared, that's the one point.

5020
07:22:19,180 --> 07:22:21,180
Wait, what did I just do?

5021
07:22:21,180 --> 07:22:23,180
Did I not put?

5022
07:22:23,180 --> 07:22:25,180
Is it like a, like anything?

5023
07:22:25,180 --> 07:22:27,180
Sorry, I think it's gone.

5024
07:22:27,180 --> 07:22:29,180
Sorry, it's called a regression.

5025
07:22:29,180 --> 07:22:32,180
If you pitch yourself past a safe limit, your body is all, this must be life or death.

5026
07:22:32,180 --> 07:22:34,180
You start feeling better, but I'm totally damaging your health.

5027
07:22:34,180 --> 07:22:35,180
Are you sure?

5028
07:22:35,180 --> 07:22:37,180
I mean, I'm just like fucking, oh no.

5029
07:22:37,180 --> 07:22:39,180
Does that mean there's a boss fight ahead?

5030
07:22:39,180 --> 07:22:43,180
Fight ahead if you're giving me a bolt?

5031
07:22:43,180 --> 07:22:46,180
Thank you very much though.

5032
07:22:46,180 --> 07:22:49,180
I might feel a little better.

5033
07:22:49,180 --> 07:22:52,180
We'll put you back together as many times as you need to.

5034
07:22:52,180 --> 07:22:56,180
We break each other beyond our limits, but we patch each other up after.

5035
07:22:56,180 --> 07:22:59,180
Oh my God, the medic reach of her?

5036
07:22:59,180 --> 07:23:01,180
When?

5037
07:23:01,180 --> 07:23:03,180
I guess in that door is locked down there.

5038
07:23:03,180 --> 07:23:06,180
Or is it a fake door?

5039
07:23:06,180 --> 07:23:09,180
Ooh!

5040
07:23:09,180 --> 07:23:12,180
Battlefield priest cookbook.

5041
07:23:12,180 --> 07:23:15,180
How many gems do you have?

5042
07:23:15,180 --> 07:23:17,180
You're going to make a blinding.

5043
07:23:17,180 --> 07:23:22,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

5044
07:23:22,180 --> 07:23:25,180
Are you giving my mummy a heart attack?

5045
07:23:25,180 --> 07:23:29,180
This is literally what gave my mum a heart attack age for it.

5046
07:23:29,180 --> 07:23:33,180
Okay, well, I have incredibly good news about my age.

5047
07:23:33,180 --> 07:23:39,180
I know V-triple rule is not to reveal your age, but I have fantastic news about my age.

5048
07:23:39,180 --> 07:23:45,180
Um, and...

5049
07:23:45,180 --> 07:23:48,180
Yeah, I...

5050
07:23:48,180 --> 07:23:50,180
Oh no, is everyone on? Is everyone on?

5051
07:23:50,180 --> 07:23:53,180
Okay, okay, good, huddle up, huddle up, refling.

5052
07:23:53,180 --> 07:23:56,180
I'm glad we're all close.

5053
07:23:56,180 --> 07:23:59,180
What happens in the elevator stays in the elevator.

5054
07:23:59,180 --> 07:24:02,180
Or the lift, you see the lift.

5055
07:24:02,180 --> 07:24:04,180
She's a hag, it's so over.

5056
07:24:04,180 --> 07:24:08,180
I am not actually a hag age.

5057
07:24:08,180 --> 07:24:12,180
Um, I am...

5058
07:24:12,180 --> 07:24:14,180
I'm not, so...

5059
07:24:14,180 --> 07:24:19,180
I assume hag age is fairy.

5060
07:24:19,180 --> 07:24:21,180
When he's thin, she's not over the...

5061
07:24:21,180 --> 07:24:24,180
I can't believe she's not to that 300,000.

5062
07:24:24,180 --> 07:24:28,180
I mean, Azura is four...

5063
07:24:28,180 --> 07:24:33,180
Is Azura four billion years old? I can't remember.

5064
07:24:33,180 --> 07:24:37,180
Azura is like above four billion years old or something like that.

5065
07:24:38,180 --> 07:24:42,180
Because I'm a cuttlefish, I'm technically as young as I started,

5066
07:24:42,180 --> 07:24:45,180
because cuttlefish only lasts two years normally.

5067
07:24:45,180 --> 07:24:51,180
I don't know what in captivation...

5068
07:24:51,180 --> 07:24:55,180
Focus me, I don't know what the word is, cuttlefish live to.

5069
07:24:55,180 --> 07:25:00,180
I have a feeling because you guys look after me,

5070
07:25:00,180 --> 07:25:04,180
I'll be better than two years than the average cuttlefish.

5071
07:25:04,180 --> 07:25:07,180
I'll last a bit longer than the average.

5072
07:25:07,180 --> 07:25:10,180
In captivity, oh that's a word.

5073
07:25:10,180 --> 07:25:12,180
Iris of Grace?

5074
07:25:12,180 --> 07:25:14,180
Oh, I like that one.

5075
07:25:14,180 --> 07:25:18,180
As long as the woman is older than me, I'm okay with that.

5076
07:25:18,180 --> 07:25:20,180
Yeah, you like older women?

5077
07:25:20,180 --> 07:25:22,180
Okay, hags are in, got it.

5078
07:25:22,180 --> 07:25:24,180
I'll keep that in mind for gentle.

5079
07:25:24,180 --> 07:25:26,180
Hags are in.

5080
07:25:26,180 --> 07:25:30,180
Ooh, look how the graces were discovering.

5081
07:25:30,180 --> 07:25:32,180
Marica's rune.

5082
07:25:32,180 --> 07:25:36,180
Oh my god, one of you guys gave me two of those.

5083
07:25:36,180 --> 07:25:38,180
Oh no.

5084
07:25:38,180 --> 07:25:40,180
Oh no, this can't be.

5085
07:25:40,180 --> 07:25:42,180
This looks like a boss fight.

5086
07:25:42,180 --> 07:25:45,180
This looks like a boss fight.

5087
07:25:45,180 --> 07:25:47,180
Getting my kisses out.

5088
07:25:55,180 --> 07:25:56,180
Oh, they're stuck.

5089
07:25:56,180 --> 07:25:59,180
I've not activated the cutscene, they're stuck.

5090
07:26:02,180 --> 07:26:06,180
I don't want to go that far away without them.

5091
07:26:09,180 --> 07:26:10,180
Is it the heart?

5092
07:26:10,180 --> 07:26:12,180
It looks like a witch's heart on the tree.

5093
07:26:12,180 --> 07:26:14,180
Is that what it is?

5094
07:26:14,180 --> 07:26:17,180
Touch the bloodstain.

5095
07:26:17,180 --> 07:26:19,180
Oh no, I'm getting scared.

5096
07:26:19,180 --> 07:26:22,180
Is it the heart, right?

5097
07:26:22,180 --> 07:26:24,180
It's a plant.

5098
07:26:24,180 --> 07:26:29,180
It's a plant.

5099
07:26:29,180 --> 07:26:32,180
I'm stuck on a freaking vine.

5100
07:26:32,180 --> 07:26:35,180
I saw a deadly sunflower.

5101
07:26:38,180 --> 07:26:41,180
Oh my god, an Astartian beach over wind.

5102
07:26:41,180 --> 07:26:44,180
Purely made in my image.

5103
07:26:44,180 --> 07:26:46,180
Did that do it?

5104
07:26:46,180 --> 07:26:49,180
Not only did 200...

5105
07:26:49,180 --> 07:26:59,180
Oh my...

5106
07:26:59,180 --> 07:27:02,180
Hold on, hold on, pause the tunes, pause the tunes.

5107
07:27:02,180 --> 07:27:04,180
Pause the fight lads.

5108
07:27:04,180 --> 07:27:07,180
I've not got my wee cross, so pause it.

5109
07:27:07,180 --> 07:27:11,180
Alright, I'm holding it, I'm holding it.

5110
07:27:11,180 --> 07:27:14,180
Okay, he holds in place though.

5111
07:27:14,180 --> 07:27:15,180
That's the good news.

5112
07:27:15,180 --> 07:27:17,180
Oh, I did a sick damage.

5113
07:27:17,180 --> 07:27:18,180
Oh, sick damage.

5114
07:27:18,180 --> 07:27:20,180
Oh, 29 damage.

5115
07:27:20,180 --> 07:27:25,180
Oh, I'm really showing him right now.

5116
07:27:25,180 --> 07:27:28,180
Oh, I'm showing him.

5117
07:27:28,180 --> 07:27:30,180
I'm showing him right now.

5118
07:27:30,180 --> 07:27:32,180
Don't you think I'm...

5119
07:27:32,180 --> 07:27:34,180
I have fire bolts, be honest.

5120
07:27:34,180 --> 07:27:35,180
Fire?

5121
07:27:35,180 --> 07:27:36,180
Yeah.

5122
07:27:36,180 --> 07:27:39,180
Why are you looking at me?

5123
07:27:39,180 --> 07:27:42,180
Don't look at me.

5124
07:27:42,180 --> 07:27:45,180
I'm just a little...

5125
07:27:45,180 --> 07:27:47,180
Wait, was that fire or am I being dumb?

5126
07:27:47,180 --> 07:27:50,180
Oh no, I've got a crossbow on, not a fricking...

5127
07:27:50,180 --> 07:27:53,180
How big is the AOE?

5128
07:27:53,180 --> 07:27:55,180
What is this?

5129
07:27:55,180 --> 07:27:56,180
What the heck?

5130
07:27:56,180 --> 07:27:58,180
We're against the Elden Lord again?

5131
07:27:58,180 --> 07:28:00,180
You're a sunflower, relax.

5132
07:28:00,180 --> 07:28:04,180
You cannot harness the fricking power of the sun.

5133
07:28:04,180 --> 07:28:06,180
Oh no, I can't hold it.

5134
07:28:06,180 --> 07:28:07,180
Oh, fricking sick.

5135
07:28:07,180 --> 07:28:09,180
Can I do poison damage on a flower?

5136
07:28:09,180 --> 07:28:12,180
Oh my god, that couldn't have gone any worse.

5137
07:28:12,180 --> 07:28:15,180
I'm sorry, that couldn't have gone any worse.

5138
07:28:15,180 --> 07:28:18,180
I couldn't have fucked that up harder if I tried.

5139
07:28:18,180 --> 07:28:21,180
I'm so sorry.

5140
07:28:21,180 --> 07:28:27,180
If you hit the head, it does 7 times damage on the sunflower.

5141
07:28:27,180 --> 07:28:30,180
I thought it was a witch's hat, honestly.

5142
07:28:30,180 --> 07:28:32,180
It looks like a witch's hat on the tree.

5143
07:28:32,180 --> 07:28:34,180
Fire and spiral shard.

5144
07:28:34,180 --> 07:28:36,180
Wait, fire?

5145
07:28:36,180 --> 07:28:39,180
Do I have a fire crossbow?

5146
07:28:39,180 --> 07:28:41,180
I have cold.

5147
07:28:41,180 --> 07:28:43,180
Would cold fuck up a plant?

5148
07:28:43,180 --> 07:28:46,180
I think cold should absolutely destroy a plant, to be honest.

5149
07:28:46,180 --> 07:28:49,180
Can plants take blood loss?

5150
07:28:49,180 --> 07:28:51,180
I think scarlet rot.

5151
07:28:51,180 --> 07:28:56,180
Scarlet rot and ice would really hurt a plant.

5152
07:28:56,180 --> 07:29:01,180
Are you guys here?

5153
07:29:01,180 --> 07:29:05,180
Okay, I see one here.

5154
07:29:05,180 --> 07:29:08,180
I'm just a fellow.

5155
07:29:08,180 --> 07:29:12,180
I'm just a girl in the world.

5156
07:29:12,180 --> 07:29:15,180
But yes, Azur Deli should be live still, question mark.

5157
07:29:15,180 --> 07:29:17,180
I don't know what I scooby-doo.

5158
07:29:17,180 --> 07:29:19,180
I told them.

5159
07:29:19,180 --> 07:29:22,180
I told them I said I'm playing with my refund.

5160
07:29:22,180 --> 07:29:23,180
Okay, set.

5161
07:29:23,180 --> 07:29:26,180
Unable to summon cooperator.

5162
07:29:26,180 --> 07:29:29,180
I didn't even accept.

5163
07:29:29,180 --> 07:29:31,180
Are we changing order or something?

5164
07:29:31,180 --> 07:29:34,180
Oh, there's quite a few of you guys at this stage.

5165
07:29:34,180 --> 07:29:36,180
Holy moly.

5166
07:29:36,180 --> 07:29:39,180
Thanos and set for the boss?

5167
07:29:39,180 --> 07:29:41,180
Wait, what boss is this?

5168
07:29:41,180 --> 07:29:45,180
The sunflower?

5169
07:29:45,180 --> 07:29:47,180
Who we got with this?

5170
07:29:47,180 --> 07:29:49,180
We've got...

5171
07:29:49,180 --> 07:29:53,180
Set and we've got...

5172
07:29:53,180 --> 07:29:57,180
My brain just blanked there.

5173
07:29:57,180 --> 07:29:59,180
Who did I just summon in?

5174
07:29:59,180 --> 07:30:00,180
Oh, Thanos.

5175
07:30:00,180 --> 07:30:03,180
Okay, that's why my brain blanked.

5176
07:30:03,180 --> 07:30:04,180
Oh my god.

5177
07:30:04,180 --> 07:30:07,180
There's no way you're fighting the sunflower Nikki.

5178
07:30:07,180 --> 07:30:08,180
Hi.

5179
07:30:08,180 --> 07:30:11,180
Are you actually fighting the sunflower Nikki?

5180
07:30:11,180 --> 07:30:14,180
I mean, I am not going to judge it as long as you're happy.

5181
07:30:14,180 --> 07:30:15,180
Okay, Azur is live.

5182
07:30:15,180 --> 07:30:16,180
There you go.

5183
07:30:16,180 --> 07:30:20,180
They need a holy moly coconut.

5184
07:30:20,180 --> 07:30:23,180
Okay, he comes out instantly now.

5185
07:30:26,180 --> 07:30:31,180
I wasn't even in the playable fucking battle zone.

5186
07:30:34,180 --> 07:30:39,180
Look at the distance.

5187
07:30:39,180 --> 07:30:45,180
That is just beyond reasonable.

5188
07:30:50,180 --> 07:30:53,180
Okay, the head is definitely taking damage though.

5189
07:30:56,180 --> 07:30:59,180
Okay, I don't know how I dodged that, but I'll take that.

5190
07:30:59,180 --> 07:31:04,180
Right, I can't dodge this because he's going to do something.

5191
07:31:04,180 --> 07:31:08,180
Okay, he's dropped target.

5192
07:31:08,180 --> 07:31:10,180
I'm just going to aim at the head so he's quite slow.

5193
07:31:10,180 --> 07:31:13,180
He lets me and he's quite exposed.

5194
07:31:13,180 --> 07:31:15,180
Although he does absolutely...

5195
07:31:15,180 --> 07:31:20,180
Oh, for fuck's sake, I tried to walk out of that.

5196
07:31:20,180 --> 07:31:23,180
Why me?

5197
07:31:23,180 --> 07:31:25,180
You have all the wraithlings on the hut.

5198
07:31:25,180 --> 07:31:28,180
I mean, it's probably better that he goes for me.

5199
07:31:28,180 --> 07:31:30,180
I'll just attack from afar.

5200
07:31:30,180 --> 07:31:32,180
I'll keep it up.

5201
07:31:32,180 --> 07:31:34,180
No, no, go for the head, the head, the head.

5202
07:31:34,180 --> 07:31:36,180
I don't miss though.

5203
07:31:36,180 --> 07:31:37,180
Don't waste...

5204
07:31:37,180 --> 07:31:39,180
Ah, fuck it, I'm going for the big one.

5205
07:31:43,180 --> 07:31:45,180
Hold on.

5206
07:31:45,180 --> 07:31:47,180
Did the mate do his thorns?

5207
07:31:47,180 --> 07:31:49,180
AoE thorns, possibly?

5208
07:31:49,180 --> 07:31:51,180
I don't know how he does it.

5209
07:31:51,180 --> 07:31:52,180
Or how he chooses?

5210
07:31:52,180 --> 07:31:55,180
Yeah, okay, that is what I don't know.

5211
07:31:55,180 --> 07:31:57,180
Again, I can't get out in time.

5212
07:31:57,180 --> 07:31:59,180
Holy crap, the AoE.

5213
07:31:59,180 --> 07:32:02,180
There's so much distance on it.

5214
07:32:04,180 --> 07:32:10,180
I'm too busy trying to recover from the fey in order to fucking get his arse.

5215
07:32:12,180 --> 07:32:15,180
I will say I like that his thorns do bleed damage.

5216
07:32:15,180 --> 07:32:17,180
I like that detail.

5217
07:32:21,180 --> 07:32:23,180
Oh, no.

5218
07:32:23,180 --> 07:32:26,180
Okay, I don't think we're going to struggle too much.

5219
07:32:26,180 --> 07:32:29,180
I'm not going to waste any more ammo.

5220
07:32:29,180 --> 07:32:32,180
Take me, Mr. Sunflower, take me.

5221
07:32:32,180 --> 07:32:34,180
I want to win with my...

5222
07:32:34,180 --> 07:32:35,180
Oh shit, my souls!

5223
07:32:35,180 --> 07:32:37,180
Oh shit, my souls!

5224
07:32:37,180 --> 07:32:39,180
Oh well.

5225
07:32:39,180 --> 07:32:41,180
You win some, you lose some.

5226
07:32:44,180 --> 07:32:47,180
I'm too scared to do the boss on that one.

5227
07:32:47,180 --> 07:32:48,180
I can't handle it.

5228
07:32:48,180 --> 07:32:50,180
My little heart can't handle it.

5229
07:32:51,180 --> 07:32:53,180
Okay, let's try that.

5230
07:32:56,180 --> 07:32:59,180
Time to wake up for your daily milking session.

5231
07:33:00,180 --> 07:33:01,180
Here we go.

5232
07:33:01,180 --> 07:33:03,180
We've got Shlumping, you're coming in.

5233
07:33:08,180 --> 07:33:10,180
And then we've got...

5234
07:33:15,180 --> 07:33:17,180
Okay, you have to tell me the reason.

5235
07:33:18,180 --> 07:33:21,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

5236
07:33:24,180 --> 07:33:27,180
Did I pick up anything else?

5237
07:33:27,180 --> 07:33:31,180
Right, I've not picked up anything that set our head where for what...

5238
07:33:32,180 --> 07:33:35,180
Other than if I wanted to like lighten myself.

5239
07:33:36,180 --> 07:33:37,180
Maybe...

5240
07:33:38,180 --> 07:33:40,180
Yeah, maybe this works.

5241
07:33:41,180 --> 07:33:42,180
What?

5242
07:33:42,180 --> 07:33:44,180
Tired of me?

5243
07:33:44,180 --> 07:33:45,180
Should be asleep right now.

5244
07:33:45,180 --> 07:33:46,180
What?

5245
07:33:46,180 --> 07:33:47,180
No, me?

5246
07:33:47,180 --> 07:33:48,180
No?

5247
07:33:48,180 --> 07:33:50,180
Okay, my reflings are ready.

5248
07:33:50,180 --> 07:33:51,180
Let's try it.

5249
07:33:53,180 --> 07:33:56,180
Can this Sunflower perish us?

5250
07:33:56,180 --> 07:33:57,180
Okay, no.

5251
07:34:05,180 --> 07:34:07,180
Bra, he is so...

5252
07:34:08,180 --> 07:34:11,180
Bra, he is so aggressive.

5253
07:34:12,180 --> 07:34:17,180
What do you mean this Elden Ring boss is hard and they didn't make him...

5254
07:34:17,180 --> 07:34:19,180
Oh, sorry, I just punched the mic with my headset.

5255
07:34:19,180 --> 07:34:22,180
I try to get comfy in my chair and I mess that up.

5256
07:34:28,180 --> 07:34:30,180
I'm doing a hip registration right now.

5257
07:34:33,180 --> 07:34:36,180
I'm trying to get frost damage on his head.

5258
07:34:38,180 --> 07:34:40,180
Okay, I'm actually just...

5259
07:34:40,180 --> 07:34:43,180
Excuse me, social distancing please.

5260
07:34:44,180 --> 07:34:46,180
I don't know how I avoided that.

5261
07:34:46,180 --> 07:34:47,180
Boom, headshot.

5262
07:34:48,180 --> 07:34:49,180
Boom, headshot.

5263
07:34:52,180 --> 07:34:56,180
Oh wait, there's a talisman for my crossbow efficiency.

5264
07:34:58,180 --> 07:35:01,180
Whoa, someone did massive damage.

5265
07:35:01,180 --> 07:35:04,180
Can you go bleed on a freaking Sunflower?

5266
07:35:04,180 --> 07:35:06,180
Where is he going for me?

5267
07:35:10,180 --> 07:35:12,180
Oh my god, you did it!

5268
07:35:14,180 --> 07:35:15,180
Come on, come on.

5269
07:35:17,180 --> 07:35:19,180
You did it, you did it, you did it.

5270
07:35:20,180 --> 07:35:21,180
Yes!

5271
07:35:23,180 --> 07:35:25,180
You did it, refling, you did it.

5272
07:35:25,180 --> 07:35:26,180
You did it.

5273
07:35:26,180 --> 07:35:27,180
You did it.

5274
07:35:27,180 --> 07:35:28,180
You did it.

5275
07:35:28,180 --> 07:35:29,180
You did it.

5276
07:35:29,180 --> 07:35:30,180
You did it.

5277
07:35:30,180 --> 07:35:31,180
You did it.

5278
07:35:31,180 --> 07:35:32,180
You did it.

5279
07:35:32,180 --> 07:35:34,180
You did it, refling, you did it.

5280
07:35:34,180 --> 07:35:35,180
You did it.

5281
07:35:35,180 --> 07:35:37,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, refling!

5282
07:35:37,180 --> 07:35:38,180
Refling!

5283
07:35:39,180 --> 07:35:40,180
You didn't...

5284
07:35:40,180 --> 07:35:41,180
What?

5285
07:35:41,180 --> 07:35:42,180
What?

5286
07:35:42,180 --> 07:35:43,180
What?

5287
07:35:44,180 --> 07:35:46,180
Does he perish himself?

5288
07:35:46,180 --> 07:35:47,180
Hello?

5289
07:35:50,180 --> 07:35:52,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

5290
07:35:58,180 --> 07:35:59,180
Oh my god.

5291
07:36:03,180 --> 07:36:05,180
Oh my god.

5292
07:36:05,180 --> 07:36:08,180
None of you told me I wasn't ogre.

5293
07:36:09,180 --> 07:36:10,180
Oh.

5294
07:36:12,180 --> 07:36:14,180
Oh, please let me heal.

5295
07:36:14,180 --> 07:36:17,180
Oh, I don't know if I got the right thing collected.

5296
07:36:17,180 --> 07:36:18,180
Why would I?

5297
07:36:21,180 --> 07:36:22,180
Oh.

5298
07:36:29,180 --> 07:36:30,180
Okay.

5299
07:36:32,180 --> 07:36:33,180
Okay.

5300
07:36:42,180 --> 07:36:44,180
I'm hating behind the tree.

5301
07:36:48,180 --> 07:36:50,180
Oh no, not again.

5302
07:36:51,180 --> 07:36:53,180
It didn't go for me, so I'll take it.

5303
07:36:53,180 --> 07:36:57,180
As if you changed aggro last second, you're such a liar.

5304
07:36:58,180 --> 07:37:00,180
And the duty hit.

5305
07:37:03,180 --> 07:37:05,180
I'm actually starting to get a bit...

5306
07:37:05,180 --> 07:37:07,180
Bleed filled up.

5307
07:37:15,180 --> 07:37:18,180
Oh, you're like looking at me, don't you?

5308
07:37:23,180 --> 07:37:25,180
I'm trying to take aggro.

5309
07:37:25,180 --> 07:37:27,180
I know I'm hardly doing any damage,

5310
07:37:27,180 --> 07:37:28,180
but like the...

5311
07:37:28,180 --> 07:37:30,180
If I can take aggro, like...

5312
07:37:31,180 --> 07:37:34,180
Not like that, not like that.

5313
07:37:42,180 --> 07:37:44,180
What are these?

5314
07:37:45,180 --> 07:37:47,180
Demons!

5315
07:37:47,180 --> 07:37:49,180
Absolute demons!

5316
07:37:51,180 --> 07:37:53,180
Oh no.

5317
07:37:54,180 --> 07:37:58,180
Heavy attacking him to the head

5318
07:37:58,180 --> 07:38:01,180
does three times more damage than normal.

5319
07:38:02,180 --> 07:38:04,180
I need milk three times a day.

5320
07:38:04,180 --> 07:38:06,180
The absolute contrast with some of this.

5321
07:38:06,180 --> 07:38:08,180
It's still going.

5322
07:38:08,180 --> 07:38:11,180
I'm still getting walloped and getting carried the way I like it.

5323
07:38:12,180 --> 07:38:15,180
If I have fire, I might be better than born arrow.

5324
07:38:15,180 --> 07:38:16,180
You know that.

5325
07:38:17,180 --> 07:38:18,180
I'll try fire.

5326
07:38:18,180 --> 07:38:19,180
Right, who came in?

5327
07:38:19,180 --> 07:38:21,180
Pineapple, you've not had a shot.

5328
07:38:24,180 --> 07:38:27,180
Mage, you've not had a shot at this boss either.

5329
07:38:36,180 --> 07:38:40,180
I like this guy because he's more like a traditional boss

5330
07:38:40,180 --> 07:38:43,180
compared to all the other bosses who just spam attack.

5331
07:38:43,180 --> 07:38:46,180
They actually give you a second to think and be like...

5332
07:38:46,180 --> 07:38:47,180
Oh...

5333
07:38:50,180 --> 07:38:51,180
Oh!

5334
07:38:51,180 --> 07:38:52,180
Oh, thank you!

5335
07:38:52,180 --> 07:38:54,180
Okay, yes, we're trying to fire.

5336
07:38:54,180 --> 07:38:57,180
I assume burn damages is a fricking weakness considering

5337
07:38:57,180 --> 07:39:00,180
it's literally a plant that I could put in a pot

5338
07:39:00,180 --> 07:39:02,180
and put in my window edge, you know?

5339
07:39:03,180 --> 07:39:04,180
Yeah, fire...

5340
07:39:04,180 --> 07:39:06,180
Oh, well, I just got fire bolts.

5341
07:39:06,180 --> 07:39:07,180
Hold on a minute.

5342
07:39:07,180 --> 07:39:08,180
Wait.

5343
07:39:08,180 --> 07:39:09,180
One...

5344
07:39:09,180 --> 07:39:10,180
Two...

5345
07:39:15,180 --> 07:39:17,180
I'm wondering if I do the ultimate on that.

5346
07:39:18,180 --> 07:39:19,180
And then just fire bolt.

5347
07:39:21,180 --> 07:39:22,180
See what happens.

5348
07:39:22,180 --> 07:39:23,180
See what happens.

5349
07:39:24,180 --> 07:39:26,180
Boneball, any boners?

5350
07:39:26,180 --> 07:39:27,180
Oh, sorry, sorry.

5351
07:39:30,180 --> 07:39:31,180
Black key...

5352
07:39:32,180 --> 07:39:33,180
Oh, wow!

5353
07:39:33,180 --> 07:39:35,180
Okay, talk about delivery.

5354
07:39:36,180 --> 07:39:37,180
I think I'm going to have to send a need.

5355
07:39:37,180 --> 07:39:39,180
I think I'm going to have to go into my inventory

5356
07:39:39,180 --> 07:39:41,180
in the lightning thing.

5357
07:39:44,180 --> 07:39:45,180
Okay.

5358
07:39:45,180 --> 07:39:46,180
ATR bolt.

5359
07:39:47,180 --> 07:39:48,180
How many?

5360
07:39:48,180 --> 07:39:50,180
Are you just giving me everything?

5361
07:39:51,180 --> 07:39:53,180
To keep bone...

5362
07:39:53,180 --> 07:39:54,180
bolt.

5363
07:39:54,180 --> 07:39:55,180
I literally haven't even discovered that yet.

5364
07:39:55,180 --> 07:39:57,180
You've given me something...

5365
07:39:57,180 --> 07:39:59,180
that I've not even discovered.

5366
07:39:59,180 --> 07:40:01,180
Step boneball.

5367
07:40:01,180 --> 07:40:02,180
Is that a table?

5368
07:40:02,180 --> 07:40:04,180
Holy shit.

5369
07:40:05,180 --> 07:40:06,180
Thank you, refling.

5370
07:40:06,180 --> 07:40:08,180
Okay, I think we'll stop.

5371
07:40:09,180 --> 07:40:10,180
Are you guys ready?

5372
07:40:11,180 --> 07:40:13,180
I didn't even know the plant had a second phase.

5373
07:40:13,180 --> 07:40:15,180
That's what we were going to.

5374
07:40:16,180 --> 07:40:17,180
Okay.

5375
07:40:18,180 --> 07:40:19,180
Here goes.

5376
07:40:20,180 --> 07:40:22,180
Okay, it's going to swipe for me.

5377
07:40:22,180 --> 07:40:24,180
I need to dodge right away.

5378
07:40:25,180 --> 07:40:26,180
Dodge.

5379
07:40:26,180 --> 07:40:28,180
And then another swipe could be for me.

5380
07:40:28,180 --> 07:40:31,180
Okay, I know I'm learning though

5381
07:40:31,180 --> 07:40:33,180
that it does go for me twice, which is fine.

5382
07:40:34,180 --> 07:40:36,180
I'm going to lock onto the head, not the B.

5383
07:40:38,180 --> 07:40:39,180
The head.

5384
07:40:39,180 --> 07:40:40,180
The head.

5385
07:40:40,180 --> 07:40:41,180
The head.

5386
07:40:41,180 --> 07:40:42,180
The head.

5387
07:40:44,180 --> 07:40:45,180
Okay, close enough.

5388
07:40:46,180 --> 07:40:48,180
It's not really beef in the middle.

5389
07:40:51,180 --> 07:40:53,180
Oh wait, hold on, I'm fucked up.

5390
07:41:03,180 --> 07:41:05,180
I really fucked up there.

5391
07:41:05,180 --> 07:41:06,180
Thank you.

5392
07:41:13,180 --> 07:41:15,180
If I can get his head to look at me again,

5393
07:41:15,180 --> 07:41:17,180
I can spray it down.

5394
07:41:17,180 --> 07:41:18,180
What's this?

5395
07:41:34,180 --> 07:41:37,180
I'm out of mana, so I'll try and do that bonus thing.

5396
07:41:43,180 --> 07:41:44,180
I don't have an...

5397
07:41:45,180 --> 07:41:47,180
How are we supposed to be...

5398
07:41:48,180 --> 07:41:50,180
Oh god, he's going to do that run thing.

5399
07:41:50,180 --> 07:41:51,180
You need to be careful, okay?

5400
07:41:51,180 --> 07:41:52,180
Thank you.

5401
07:41:52,180 --> 07:41:54,180
He's going to come up again.

5402
07:41:55,180 --> 07:41:57,180
I don't know where.

5403
07:41:58,180 --> 07:41:59,180
I found where.

5404
07:42:00,180 --> 07:42:02,180
I don't know who he's going to run at.

5405
07:42:02,180 --> 07:42:04,180
You, it looks like.

5406
07:42:06,180 --> 07:42:07,180
He's not having it.

5407
07:42:07,180 --> 07:42:08,180
He's reaching.

5408
07:42:09,180 --> 07:42:12,180
Okay, well, I'm too slow to even react to that.

5409
07:42:16,180 --> 07:42:19,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't just change enemy.

5410
07:42:26,180 --> 07:42:27,180
Oh my...

5411
07:42:29,180 --> 07:42:31,180
Oh, but when I do blood loss on an enemy,

5412
07:42:31,180 --> 07:42:33,180
it's a tiddly wank.

5413
07:42:38,180 --> 07:42:40,180
I'm not going to make it.

5414
07:42:40,180 --> 07:42:42,180
I'm not going to make it.

5415
07:42:45,180 --> 07:42:47,180
I'm not going to make it.

5416
07:42:52,180 --> 07:42:53,180
I think we need...

5417
07:42:53,180 --> 07:42:55,180
I think we need to replant up

5418
07:42:55,180 --> 07:42:57,180
in order to do the second phase.

5419
07:42:57,180 --> 07:42:59,180
It's so aggressive.

5420
07:42:59,180 --> 07:43:01,180
It's so aggressive, I can't keep up.

5421
07:43:03,180 --> 07:43:06,180
The distance to close as well

5422
07:43:06,180 --> 07:43:08,180
is just astronomical.

5423
07:43:12,180 --> 07:43:14,180
I'm missing everything.

5424
07:43:15,180 --> 07:43:17,180
My first replant is getting annihilated.

5425
07:43:21,180 --> 07:43:23,180
Hey, look at me, buddy.

5426
07:43:23,180 --> 07:43:24,180
There we go.

5427
07:43:29,180 --> 07:43:31,180
Nice change already.

5428
07:43:40,180 --> 07:43:42,180
I don't know how I missed that first one.

5429
07:43:48,180 --> 07:43:49,180
Fuck, Nail.

5430
07:43:49,180 --> 07:43:52,180
Even the planet, like, the sun magic?

5431
07:43:52,180 --> 07:43:54,180
I don't know.

5432
07:43:55,180 --> 07:43:58,180
That's right, I'm doing 12 damage.

5433
07:43:58,180 --> 07:44:00,180
You're welcome.

5434
07:44:00,180 --> 07:44:02,180
Ah, I haven't got it.

5435
07:44:02,180 --> 07:44:06,180
That second phase is just crazy.

5436
07:44:06,180 --> 07:44:08,180
Strony, sorry, boys.

5437
07:44:08,180 --> 07:44:10,180
I don't suppose we should do the same thing, but...

5438
07:44:10,180 --> 07:44:11,180
Yeah.

5439
07:44:11,180 --> 07:44:14,180
I'm going to pull them out of my inventory on the fire

5440
07:44:14,180 --> 07:44:16,180
because someone said I'm supposed to do that.

5441
07:44:16,180 --> 07:44:18,180
That is a brutal plan.

5442
07:44:18,180 --> 07:44:20,180
Baruto.

5443
07:44:20,180 --> 07:44:21,180
Ran out of stamina.

5444
07:44:21,180 --> 07:44:23,180
No, don't worry about it.

5445
07:44:23,180 --> 07:44:25,180
I'm off for the night. Good luck, everyone.

5446
07:44:25,180 --> 07:44:27,180
And don't forget to drink, Strony.

5447
07:44:27,180 --> 07:44:29,180
Water?

5448
07:44:31,180 --> 07:44:33,180
Let me hide you. Hold on.

5449
07:44:33,180 --> 07:44:35,180
I did get a glass of Cuda.

5450
07:44:35,180 --> 07:44:37,180
A glass of Cuda.

5451
07:44:40,180 --> 07:44:43,180
Statistically, I'm going to sleep bloody well tonight.

5452
07:44:45,180 --> 07:44:48,180
Because exhaustion has to result in a coma at some point.

5453
07:44:48,180 --> 07:44:51,180
So I might as well just keep fucking going.

5454
07:44:52,180 --> 07:44:53,180
Oh, sorry.

5455
07:44:53,180 --> 07:44:55,180
Sorry, my inventory.

5456
07:44:55,180 --> 07:44:57,180
My inventory.

5457
07:44:57,180 --> 07:44:59,180
Remember I spell...

5458
07:44:59,180 --> 07:45:00,180
Sort.

5459
07:45:00,180 --> 07:45:02,180
Chest.

5460
07:45:02,180 --> 07:45:03,180
Yes.

5461
07:45:03,180 --> 07:45:05,180
I would like to...

5462
07:45:05,180 --> 07:45:08,180
In my chest, I have rune.

5463
07:45:08,180 --> 07:45:10,180
I need vaults.

5464
07:45:10,180 --> 07:45:12,180
Can I only have 99 in a category?

5465
07:45:15,180 --> 07:45:17,180
Um...

5466
07:45:17,180 --> 07:45:19,180
Okay.

5467
07:45:19,180 --> 07:45:21,180
Store, know, the moon?

5468
07:45:21,180 --> 07:45:23,180
How do I access the chest?

5469
07:45:32,180 --> 07:45:34,180
Switch back. Switch to chest.

5470
07:45:34,180 --> 07:45:36,180
Why?

5471
07:45:36,180 --> 07:45:38,180
Take out...

5472
07:45:40,180 --> 07:45:42,180
It only took a thousand years.

5473
07:45:42,180 --> 07:45:44,180
Your inventory's full.

5474
07:45:45,180 --> 07:45:48,180
Like, if I put other shite in it, like this shite...

5475
07:45:52,180 --> 07:45:54,180
Like you, store.

5476
07:45:54,180 --> 07:45:56,180
You, store.

5477
07:45:56,180 --> 07:45:58,180
I can't even use you.

5478
07:45:58,180 --> 07:46:00,180
Like...

5479
07:46:00,180 --> 07:46:02,180
What's that?

5480
07:46:02,180 --> 07:46:04,180
You store all this to kind of use it?

5481
07:46:15,180 --> 07:46:17,180
Keep the whip.

5482
07:46:17,180 --> 07:46:19,180
And then go here.

5483
07:46:19,180 --> 07:46:21,180
And then I'll let me bring it out.

5484
07:46:21,180 --> 07:46:22,180
Ah, fuck off.

5485
07:46:22,180 --> 07:46:24,180
Right, whatever.

5486
07:46:25,180 --> 07:46:28,180
Nah, if you have 99 in both, you can't play any more music.

5487
07:46:28,180 --> 07:46:30,180
Man, that's it.

5488
07:46:30,180 --> 07:46:33,180
Rob, all the things this game lets you do, that's where they draw the line.

5489
07:46:33,180 --> 07:46:34,180
Like, yeah.

5490
07:46:34,180 --> 07:46:36,180
Say, have you had a shot of it?

5491
07:46:36,180 --> 07:46:38,180
And you have...

5492
07:46:38,180 --> 07:46:41,180
Slumping, you had a shot.

5493
07:46:42,180 --> 07:46:44,180
Just the fella...

5494
07:46:44,180 --> 07:46:47,180
Hasn't had a shot of the sunflower?

5495
07:46:50,180 --> 07:46:52,180
Alright, let me write that down.

5496
07:46:54,180 --> 07:46:57,180
Paying off what you did, have a wee shot.

5497
07:46:57,180 --> 07:47:00,180
Of net, you had a shot.

5498
07:47:00,180 --> 07:47:03,180
Can't you ever see if you've not had a shot of them?

5499
07:47:05,180 --> 07:47:06,180
Okay.

5500
07:47:07,180 --> 07:47:09,180
Mmm.

5501
07:47:09,180 --> 07:47:12,180
Netmer's ever seen collection coming to life.

5502
07:47:12,180 --> 07:47:13,180
Bro, literally.

5503
07:47:13,180 --> 07:47:15,180
I've never seen Little Shop of Horrors,

5504
07:47:15,180 --> 07:47:18,180
but apparently it's about a plant that can talk or something.

5505
07:47:18,180 --> 07:47:21,180
I've been recommended to watch it so many times.

5506
07:47:21,180 --> 07:47:24,180
They're like, oh, it's the classic, it's the classic.

5507
07:47:24,180 --> 07:47:26,180
You need to watch Little Shop of Horrors.

5508
07:47:26,180 --> 07:47:28,180
And I'm like...

5509
07:47:28,180 --> 07:47:30,180
I'm too tired.

5510
07:47:31,180 --> 07:47:33,180
Okay, are we ready?

5511
07:47:36,180 --> 07:47:38,180
Are you ready to carry me?

5512
07:47:38,180 --> 07:47:41,180
Please stay true to your emotes and carry me.

5513
07:47:41,180 --> 07:47:43,180
Carry me.

5514
07:47:44,180 --> 07:47:46,180
Oh wait, is that double-fisting?

5515
07:47:46,180 --> 07:47:48,180
Hold on, I'm here for it.

5516
07:47:48,180 --> 07:47:49,180
Hold on.

5517
07:47:49,180 --> 07:47:51,180
Hold on, I purposely put all my inventory away

5518
07:47:51,180 --> 07:47:53,180
so I can do this really quickly.

5519
07:47:57,180 --> 07:47:59,180
Alright, let me get my bow out.

5520
07:48:00,180 --> 07:48:03,180
I'll do the rapid fire, then I'll just swap

5521
07:48:03,180 --> 07:48:05,180
to the actual one that's there.

5522
07:48:05,180 --> 07:48:07,180
Are we ready?

5523
07:48:07,180 --> 07:48:09,180
I wanna help Mommy out and get a smith,

5524
07:48:09,180 --> 07:48:11,180
but I'm way too far behind.

5525
07:48:11,180 --> 07:48:13,180
Bro, I'm literally...

5526
07:48:13,180 --> 07:48:15,180
The only reason on my head is because

5527
07:48:15,180 --> 07:48:17,180
Reflins are carrying me.

5528
07:48:17,180 --> 07:48:18,180
Oh, he changed.

5529
07:48:18,180 --> 07:48:20,180
Normally he always goes through me.

5530
07:48:20,180 --> 07:48:22,180
That's the first time he has...

5531
07:48:22,180 --> 07:48:24,180
The trees are in the way.

5532
07:48:24,180 --> 07:48:26,180
Okay, let's see.

5533
07:48:26,180 --> 07:48:28,180
My ultimate, how do I move it?

5534
07:48:30,180 --> 07:48:32,180
That one, nope, that's just healing.

5535
07:48:36,180 --> 07:48:39,180
Okay, woo!

5536
07:48:40,180 --> 07:48:42,180
That happens every time.

5537
07:48:46,180 --> 07:48:47,180
Ouch.

5538
07:48:47,180 --> 07:48:50,180
Ouch, I missed both dodges.

5539
07:48:53,180 --> 07:48:55,180
Uh, I gotta do this again.

5540
07:48:56,180 --> 07:48:58,180
I keep healing by accident.

5541
07:48:58,180 --> 07:49:00,180
I'm wasting my heal, sorry.

5542
07:49:01,180 --> 07:49:03,180
You didn't even...

5543
07:49:03,180 --> 07:49:05,180
Pull it!

5544
07:49:05,180 --> 07:49:07,180
Bro, sorry, I'm getting very tired.

5545
07:49:07,180 --> 07:49:09,180
Oh, I'm so sorry.

5546
07:49:11,180 --> 07:49:13,180
I'm getting baby brains.

5547
07:49:13,180 --> 07:49:15,180
I'm getting baby brains.

5548
07:49:15,180 --> 07:49:17,180
I'm getting so tired.

5549
07:49:17,180 --> 07:49:19,180
Are you squiddin' me right now?

5550
07:49:23,180 --> 07:49:25,180
Use manual.

5551
07:49:25,180 --> 07:49:27,180
Thank you, Apple and Vox for the set.

5552
07:49:27,180 --> 07:49:29,180
Manual, baby.

5553
07:49:30,180 --> 07:49:32,180
Uh...

5554
07:49:33,180 --> 07:49:36,180
Sorry, I'm definitely starting to lag a bit.

5555
07:49:36,180 --> 07:49:38,180
I'm like, not lag in game.

5556
07:49:38,180 --> 07:49:41,180
I mean, lag fall asleep, so I do apologize.

5557
07:49:41,180 --> 07:49:44,180
It's just making you cringe out your boots.

5558
07:49:44,180 --> 07:49:48,180
Phoenix, you've not had a shot at this boss yet.

5559
07:49:52,180 --> 07:49:54,180
Maino spelling mistake.

5560
07:49:54,180 --> 07:49:56,180
You'll be obliterated for such a thing.

5561
07:49:56,180 --> 07:49:58,180
Brian, I'll let you know.

5562
07:49:59,180 --> 07:50:01,180
Uh...

5563
07:50:01,180 --> 07:50:03,180
We had a shot.

5564
07:50:03,180 --> 07:50:05,180
Who's up next?

5565
07:50:05,180 --> 07:50:07,180
Come on.

5566
07:50:07,180 --> 07:50:09,180
If we do it in order of who's come...

5567
07:50:09,180 --> 07:50:11,180
Who's up here?

5568
07:50:13,180 --> 07:50:15,180
Oh.

5569
07:50:15,180 --> 07:50:17,180
Sorry, just our cure off it.

5570
07:50:17,180 --> 07:50:19,180
I completely forgot we came that way.

5571
07:50:22,180 --> 07:50:24,180
Your favorite edgy girl.

5572
07:50:24,180 --> 07:50:26,180
Oh, is that how you...

5573
07:50:26,180 --> 07:50:28,180
Can I bend over it?

5574
07:50:30,180 --> 07:50:32,180
Mm.

5575
07:50:33,180 --> 07:50:35,180
Okay, I'm done.

5576
07:50:37,180 --> 07:50:39,180
Are we ready?

5577
07:50:39,180 --> 07:50:41,180
Ready to carry me?

5578
07:50:44,180 --> 07:50:47,180
Okay, let him lock onto me and break some trees.

5579
07:50:49,180 --> 07:50:51,180
Oh, the tree stops it?

5580
07:50:51,180 --> 07:50:53,180
I can't see the other.

5581
07:50:53,180 --> 07:50:55,180
Whoa, I just missed that no more.

5582
07:50:55,180 --> 07:50:57,180
Oh, he didn't.

5583
07:50:57,180 --> 07:51:00,180
It's very hard to see where he's looking,

5584
07:51:00,180 --> 07:51:02,180
or I'm just dumb.

5585
07:51:02,180 --> 07:51:05,180
That's a very acceptable answer.

5586
07:51:06,180 --> 07:51:08,180
Oh, my God.

5587
07:51:08,180 --> 07:51:10,180
A whole 300 damage?

5588
07:51:10,180 --> 07:51:12,180
Oh, I'm out.

5589
07:51:15,180 --> 07:51:17,180
I completely missed that one, but...

5590
07:51:18,180 --> 07:51:21,180
When he licks at me, it's so scary.

5591
07:51:27,180 --> 07:51:30,180
Actually, you know what I've just been reminded of?

5592
07:51:30,180 --> 07:51:32,180
Hold on.

5593
07:51:35,180 --> 07:51:37,180
Hold on.

5594
07:51:37,180 --> 07:51:39,180
I'm pretty sure I need to do this.

5595
07:51:40,180 --> 07:51:42,180
Someone gave me a ranger's talisman.

5596
07:51:42,180 --> 07:51:44,180
Yeah, okay.

5597
07:51:45,180 --> 07:51:47,180
That might make a difference over time.

5598
07:51:47,180 --> 07:51:49,180
You never know.

5599
07:51:51,180 --> 07:51:53,180
Aw.

5600
07:51:58,180 --> 07:52:01,180
I mean, they're kind of burning him down.

5601
07:52:05,180 --> 07:52:07,180
I wish I could take aggro.

5602
07:52:07,180 --> 07:52:09,180
I don't like that, though.

5603
07:52:11,180 --> 07:52:13,180
Okay.

5604
07:52:13,180 --> 07:52:15,180
Okay, he's gonna come back.

5605
07:52:16,180 --> 07:52:18,180
Don't want to run over.

5606
07:52:18,180 --> 07:52:20,180
You can't equip at this time.

5607
07:52:20,180 --> 07:52:22,180
Oh, that would be too...

5608
07:52:22,180 --> 07:52:25,180
Let's just fucking shove any old arrow on it.

5609
07:52:28,180 --> 07:52:30,180
What?

5610
07:52:30,180 --> 07:52:33,180
Why would you come after me?

5611
07:52:33,180 --> 07:52:36,180
I did the least damage on you.

5612
07:52:36,180 --> 07:52:39,180
And you've done the most damage on me.

5613
07:52:43,180 --> 07:52:45,180
I'm way too drunk to play the boss.

5614
07:52:45,180 --> 07:52:47,180
Are you steaming right now?

5615
07:52:47,180 --> 07:52:49,180
Try to help me win this game.

5616
07:52:53,180 --> 07:52:55,180
Oh, what is this?

5617
07:52:55,180 --> 07:52:57,180
Can you aim for the head?

5618
07:53:01,180 --> 07:53:03,180
Oh, I can...

5619
07:53:03,180 --> 07:53:05,180
Oh, I just got out of a ranger no more.

5620
07:53:12,180 --> 07:53:15,180
I'm trying not to cross over on the path of leaflings

5621
07:53:15,180 --> 07:53:18,180
in case he does a long arm against me

5622
07:53:18,180 --> 07:53:20,180
and then I end up hurting the leaflings.

5623
07:53:21,180 --> 07:53:24,180
Oh, I'm getting really out of range.

5624
07:53:24,180 --> 07:53:27,180
I don't want to get close either.

5625
07:53:27,180 --> 07:53:30,180
Holy shit, we're like 50% though.

5626
07:53:33,180 --> 07:53:35,180
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

5627
07:53:37,180 --> 07:53:39,180
No.

5628
07:53:40,180 --> 07:53:42,180
Oh, you're...

5629
07:53:42,180 --> 07:53:45,180
No, no, no, like this.

5630
07:53:45,180 --> 07:53:47,180
No, like this.

5631
07:53:48,180 --> 07:53:50,180
No, like this.

5632
07:53:50,180 --> 07:53:52,180
No, I just did.

5633
07:53:52,180 --> 07:53:55,180
I just threw so badly.

5634
07:53:55,180 --> 07:53:58,180
I just said, oh, we got 50%.

5635
07:53:58,180 --> 07:54:00,180
I think we can do it.

5636
07:54:00,180 --> 07:54:03,180
If you guys are able to get 50%,

5637
07:54:03,180 --> 07:54:05,180
I think you can do it.

5638
07:54:05,180 --> 07:54:07,180
50% on phase two.

5639
07:54:11,180 --> 07:54:15,180
I believe, I believe in the leaflings.

5640
07:54:15,180 --> 07:54:17,180
No way.

5641
07:54:28,180 --> 07:54:30,180
Didn't expect Elden Ring

5642
07:54:30,180 --> 07:54:33,180
in the hit video game, Elden Ring.

5643
07:54:33,180 --> 07:54:35,180
Okay, fan up for income.

5644
07:54:41,180 --> 07:54:43,180
That was a really good attempt though.

5645
07:54:43,180 --> 07:54:46,180
I think we'll do...

5646
07:54:46,180 --> 07:54:48,180
We'll finish this boss.

5647
07:54:48,180 --> 07:54:50,180
Oh wait, does that not work?

5648
07:54:50,180 --> 07:54:52,180
We'll finish this boss

5649
07:54:52,180 --> 07:54:54,180
and then I think I might have to go

5650
07:54:54,180 --> 07:54:56,180
and try and get a focus boost.

5651
07:54:56,180 --> 07:54:59,180
So, I'm not going to do...

5652
07:54:59,180 --> 07:55:01,180
There's just a few in.

5653
07:55:01,180 --> 07:55:02,180
I'm having them.

5654
07:55:02,180 --> 07:55:06,180
I mean, there's only one other summon in that I can have.

5655
07:55:07,180 --> 07:55:08,180
Hmm.

5656
07:55:12,180 --> 07:55:13,180
We'll defeat this boss

5657
07:55:13,180 --> 07:55:17,180
and then I think I need to try and get a big focus boost.

5658
07:55:19,180 --> 07:55:21,180
I can't believe I'm taking HP damage

5659
07:55:21,180 --> 07:55:23,180
just from existing.

5660
07:55:23,180 --> 07:55:25,180
It's often.

5661
07:55:25,180 --> 07:55:27,180
I mean, what HP damage?

5662
07:55:27,180 --> 07:55:28,180
Are you kidding me?

5663
07:55:28,180 --> 07:55:29,180
Fucking 5% debuff?

5664
07:55:29,180 --> 07:55:30,180
Are you kidding me?

5665
07:55:30,180 --> 07:55:32,180
Okay, good luck kisses.

5666
07:55:32,180 --> 07:55:35,180
Okay, let's go.

5667
07:55:36,180 --> 07:55:38,180
Just a brisk 8-hour stream today.

5668
07:55:38,180 --> 07:55:42,180
Yeah, casual stream, unfortunately.

5669
07:55:42,180 --> 07:55:44,180
I can't see the others coming in

5670
07:55:44,180 --> 07:55:47,180
but that tree just blocked them, so...

5671
07:55:47,180 --> 07:55:49,180
I'll take that.

5672
07:55:49,180 --> 07:55:53,180
Whoa, someone just cast Spell and worked them.

5673
07:55:53,180 --> 07:55:54,180
Whoa!

5674
07:55:54,180 --> 07:55:57,180
What are you casting?

5675
07:55:57,180 --> 07:55:59,180
Oh shit.

5676
07:56:06,180 --> 07:56:07,180
Okay.

5677
07:56:17,180 --> 07:56:18,180
Ipsies.

5678
07:56:18,180 --> 07:56:19,180
It's a little tired.

5679
07:56:19,180 --> 07:56:21,180
Ipsies.

5680
07:56:21,180 --> 07:56:23,180
Ipsy pipsies.

5681
07:56:25,180 --> 07:56:27,180
This can be the tired.

5682
07:56:28,180 --> 07:56:29,180
Okay.

5683
07:56:30,180 --> 07:56:31,180
Okay.

5684
07:56:31,180 --> 07:56:32,180
Origin.

5685
07:56:32,180 --> 07:56:35,180
Pretty good considering that was phase one.

5686
07:56:35,180 --> 07:56:37,180
Eight hours, I'm about to work.

5687
07:56:37,180 --> 07:56:38,180
You will be on your phone in bed

5688
07:56:38,180 --> 07:56:40,180
for two more hours, right?

5689
07:56:40,180 --> 07:56:42,180
I'm literally going to lie down

5690
07:56:42,180 --> 07:56:45,180
and put Binding of Isaac gameplay on

5691
07:56:45,180 --> 07:56:46,180
and go to sleep.

5692
07:56:46,180 --> 07:56:48,180
I'm not very well.

5693
07:56:49,180 --> 07:56:50,180
I can be...

5694
07:56:50,180 --> 07:56:51,180
Holy shit!

5695
07:56:51,180 --> 07:56:54,180
How are you doing that kind of damage?

5696
07:56:55,180 --> 07:56:57,180
I don't understand.

5697
07:57:00,180 --> 07:57:01,180
Oh, shit.

5698
07:57:01,180 --> 07:57:02,180
Ow!

5699
07:57:03,180 --> 07:57:05,180
It's spanked by a plant.

5700
07:57:08,180 --> 07:57:09,180
I want to keep my HP high.

5701
07:57:09,180 --> 07:57:10,180
I do not want to...

5702
07:57:10,180 --> 07:57:12,180
Thank you, thank you, sorry.

5703
07:57:12,180 --> 07:57:14,180
I want to keep it high.

5704
07:57:21,180 --> 07:57:22,180
Brats.

5705
07:57:22,180 --> 07:57:24,180
See, I didn't want to be in the path of another refling.

5706
07:57:24,180 --> 07:57:25,180
That's the problem.

5707
07:57:25,180 --> 07:57:28,180
We might end up accidentally hurting each other.

5708
07:57:28,180 --> 07:57:31,180
How the fuck is that Madden and Strike doing so much?

5709
07:57:33,180 --> 07:57:37,180
Oh my god, I'm doing like nothing to help at all.

5710
07:57:37,180 --> 07:57:40,180
Other than perishing, clearly.

5711
07:57:41,180 --> 07:57:42,180
Okay, that's fine.

5712
07:57:42,180 --> 07:57:43,180
I've got heals.

5713
07:57:43,180 --> 07:57:45,180
I've got plenty.

5714
07:57:45,180 --> 07:57:46,180
Okay.

5715
07:57:49,180 --> 07:57:50,180
Is it going to swipe?

5716
07:57:50,180 --> 07:57:51,180
What's he doing?

5717
07:57:51,180 --> 07:57:52,180
Is it going to swipe?

5718
07:57:52,180 --> 07:57:53,180
Okay.

5719
07:58:01,180 --> 07:58:02,180
Okay.

5720
07:58:05,180 --> 07:58:06,180
Okay.

5721
07:58:06,180 --> 07:58:08,180
Okay, I can get shot in.

5722
07:58:08,180 --> 07:58:11,180
And then he does cut in really big and annoying here.

5723
07:58:11,180 --> 07:58:13,180
That's exactly what I thought.

5724
07:58:13,180 --> 07:58:14,180
I've got a blast.

5725
07:58:14,180 --> 07:58:15,180
It's okay.

5726
07:58:15,180 --> 07:58:17,180
I'm okay, I'm okay.

5727
07:58:17,180 --> 07:58:19,180
I don't have blood loss just yet.

5728
07:58:19,180 --> 07:58:20,180
I've got a heal.

5729
07:58:20,180 --> 07:58:22,180
I've got one more heal in the tank.

5730
07:58:23,180 --> 07:58:24,180
One more heal.

5731
07:58:27,180 --> 07:58:28,180
I'm helping.

5732
07:58:29,180 --> 07:58:30,180
I'm losing.

5733
07:58:30,180 --> 07:58:31,180
I'm losing.

5734
07:58:31,180 --> 07:58:32,180
I'm going to die.

5735
07:58:32,180 --> 07:58:33,180
I get hit again.

5736
07:58:33,180 --> 07:58:34,180
I think I'm dead because I've got blood loss.

5737
07:58:35,180 --> 07:58:37,180
Oh, by a bow here.

5738
07:58:37,180 --> 07:58:38,180
By a bow here.

5739
07:58:38,180 --> 07:58:39,180
Oh my god.

5740
07:58:39,180 --> 07:58:40,180
Refling.

5741
07:58:40,180 --> 07:58:42,180
I think I need you to kill him like right now.

5742
07:58:43,180 --> 07:58:44,180
I can't do anything.

5743
07:58:44,180 --> 07:58:46,180
I'm going to suffer from blood loss.

5744
07:58:47,180 --> 07:58:48,180
Oh, no.

5745
07:58:48,180 --> 07:58:52,180
But when the fucking aim is on you, it gets worse.

5746
07:58:53,180 --> 07:58:54,180
Oh my god, did you do it?

5747
07:58:55,180 --> 07:58:56,180
You did it.

5748
07:58:57,180 --> 07:58:59,180
Oh my god, you did it.

5749
07:59:00,180 --> 07:59:01,180
Fuck me, man.

5750
07:59:02,180 --> 07:59:03,180
Oh, no, it's dead.

5751
07:59:03,180 --> 07:59:04,180
Sorry.

5752
07:59:04,180 --> 07:59:05,180
Sorry.

5753
07:59:05,180 --> 07:59:06,180
I didn't have any HP remaining.

5754
07:59:06,180 --> 07:59:07,180
Oh my god, you did it.

5755
07:59:07,180 --> 07:59:09,180
You've vanquished the beast.

5756
07:59:10,180 --> 07:59:12,180
Wait, does that mean I have to go offline now?

5757
07:59:14,180 --> 07:59:15,180
What?

5758
07:59:17,180 --> 07:59:18,180
Ah!

5759
07:59:23,180 --> 07:59:24,180
Ah!

5760
07:59:31,180 --> 07:59:32,080
Um

5761
07:59:32,180 --> 07:59:33,180
Um

5762
07:59:34,180 --> 07:59:35,180
Um-um-um.

5763
07:59:35,180 --> 07:59:36,180
Um.

5764
07:59:36,180 --> 07:59:37,180
Um-um-um-um-um.

5765
07:59:38,180 --> 07:59:39,180
Em-imm-imm?

5766
07:59:43,180 --> 07:59:43,680
Ah.

5767
07:59:46,180 --> 07:59:49,060
Why is the music so sad for the sauce fight?

5768
07:59:58,260 --> 07:59:59,060
What's this?

5769
08:00:02,020 --> 08:00:06,580
Is he- is the music sad because he's killing himself to try and win this fight?

5770
08:00:08,420 --> 08:00:09,620
Is he getting weaker?

5771
08:00:10,180 --> 08:00:12,340
I'm shooting his weak fucking face.

5772
08:00:13,540 --> 08:00:14,100
Now?

5773
08:00:16,980 --> 08:00:19,540
Embrace the shadow sunflower.

5774
08:00:20,980 --> 08:00:23,220
What on earth was that?

5775
08:00:25,780 --> 08:00:27,380
Jeez, I don't know how you did that.

5776
08:00:27,380 --> 08:00:29,380
Was he getting weaker and weaker?

5777
08:00:30,660 --> 08:00:35,620
If the music is sad and the school's saying you're either the villain or the boss of fighting for the fight.

5778
08:00:35,620 --> 08:00:40,660
If the music is sad and the school's saying you're either the villain or the boss of fighting for the long reason.

5779
08:00:40,660 --> 08:00:41,620
Oh no.

5780
08:00:41,620 --> 08:00:43,220
Literally, I heard a violin.

5781
08:00:48,660 --> 08:00:50,500
Oh yeah, totally first try.

5782
08:00:50,500 --> 08:00:52,580
Yeah, it seems like he got weaker and weaker.

5783
08:00:53,140 --> 08:00:56,020
Double madness seal for-

5784
08:00:57,940 --> 08:00:59,460
Oh, tarnished well done.

5785
08:00:59,460 --> 08:01:02,660
Double madness seal for 50% damage increase.

5786
08:01:03,540 --> 08:01:07,060
Jeez, that was insane.

5787
08:01:09,060 --> 08:01:11,540
Oh fuck, I'm actually supposed to- is this just a dead end?

5788
08:01:14,900 --> 08:01:15,400
What?

5789
08:01:16,420 --> 08:01:16,920
What?

5790
08:01:18,340 --> 08:01:19,860
I got a seal though?

5791
08:01:19,860 --> 08:01:21,380
Thank you for grabbing the aggro.

5792
08:01:22,180 --> 08:01:24,820
That strat won't work if I didn't go and get it.

5793
08:01:26,180 --> 08:01:28,500
It's my billions of gold, as I said.

5794
08:01:28,500 --> 08:01:30,100
No, it's fine, we won!

5795
08:01:31,220 --> 08:01:32,340
Where's the next boss?

5796
08:01:33,220 --> 08:01:33,720
Oh yeah.

5797
08:01:34,900 --> 08:01:36,020
Where's the next one?

5798
08:01:36,020 --> 08:01:36,740
Where do we go?

5799
08:01:39,700 --> 08:01:40,900
So I came all the way-

5800
08:01:40,900 --> 08:01:43,460
So I'm like underneath this section here.

5801
08:01:45,540 --> 08:01:49,220
Um, I don't think there's anything I can do back here.

5802
08:01:50,900 --> 08:01:54,420
So I need to sleep a little bit, but take her to Bale.

5803
08:01:56,100 --> 08:01:57,060
Dragon Mountain?

5804
08:01:58,180 --> 08:02:01,620
I thought the next boss was actually getting a good night's rest, honestly.

5805
08:02:01,620 --> 08:02:02,100
Got him.

5806
08:02:02,900 --> 08:02:05,460
We were going to bed after the boss.

5807
08:02:05,460 --> 08:02:07,380
How about- how about one more boss?

5808
08:02:08,260 --> 08:02:08,760
So...

5809
08:02:11,780 --> 08:02:15,300
I can't progress at the castle because I'm too rubbish.

5810
08:02:16,740 --> 08:02:17,700
I vote Bale.

5811
08:02:17,700 --> 08:02:19,300
Bale will humble us.

5812
08:02:19,300 --> 08:02:23,380
There's two boss- no, there's one boss, the snake boss we're stuck at.

5813
08:02:24,740 --> 08:02:26,180
But we did the sunflower.

5814
08:02:29,300 --> 08:02:29,800
Where?

5815
08:02:30,120 --> 08:02:30,840
Strony!

5816
08:02:30,840 --> 08:02:31,320
Re-flang!

5817
08:02:31,320 --> 08:02:33,240
You had 99 cookies, thank you Strony!

5818
08:02:33,240 --> 08:02:41,240
No, I'm 85, we're doing a two back-to-back endurance runescape stream, just to see if we'll get there.

5819
08:02:42,600 --> 08:02:45,080
Strony says one more boss, like it's easy peasy-

5820
08:02:45,080 --> 08:02:48,600
Oh, it's easy peasy because you guys are carrying me through it.

5821
08:02:50,520 --> 08:02:51,640
How do I get up here?

5822
08:02:51,640 --> 08:02:53,400
I don't know, I want it.

5823
08:02:53,400 --> 08:02:56,680
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

5824
08:02:56,680 --> 08:02:57,720
How do I get up here?

5825
08:02:57,720 --> 08:02:59,320
I don't know, I want it.

5826
08:03:00,200 --> 08:03:01,560
Anyway, maybe this?

5827
08:03:03,240 --> 08:03:05,160
Hmm, doesn't really look like that though.

5828
08:03:07,640 --> 08:03:12,520
I think I could probably take a horse and take it down here to this area.

5829
08:03:15,720 --> 08:03:16,520
We've got this.

5830
08:03:16,520 --> 08:03:17,400
Right, where am I heading?

5831
08:03:17,400 --> 08:03:18,360
Someone says Bale.

5832
08:03:19,640 --> 08:03:20,760
I don't know where Bale is.

5833
08:03:22,680 --> 08:03:24,520
We're on Cathedral's morning.

5834
08:03:24,760 --> 08:03:26,520
I don't think I've ever walked the Blue Cove Bale.

5835
08:03:27,720 --> 08:03:29,480
And I'm stuck in this castle.

5836
08:03:30,680 --> 08:03:36,840
I did get this here as a divine beast, but I could go up here.

5837
08:03:38,440 --> 08:03:39,640
That looks like a dead end though.

5838
08:03:41,080 --> 08:03:42,920
Unless I can go down in the water.

5839
08:03:44,200 --> 08:03:46,760
Come back down into the water and go up the water.

5840
08:03:48,600 --> 08:03:50,680
Far so for Bale, far so.

5841
08:03:51,240 --> 08:03:58,040
I've got grief, like, fleeing.

5842
08:03:59,880 --> 08:04:01,160
There's a ghost over there.

5843
08:04:02,680 --> 08:04:03,880
I thought you were going to bed.

5844
08:04:03,880 --> 08:04:05,080
Oh, I just needed more.

5845
08:04:07,400 --> 08:04:10,040
Stony, some of these bosses can take hours to go to bed.

5846
08:04:10,040 --> 08:04:12,840
Well, at least let me know what we're up against tomorrow.

5847
08:04:13,640 --> 08:04:14,520
I let me know.

5848
08:04:16,680 --> 08:04:17,720
I just need to know.

5849
08:04:18,280 --> 08:04:19,720
Right, so what if I take a...

5850
08:04:21,000 --> 08:04:23,000
I keep going this way.

5851
08:04:23,000 --> 08:04:23,320
Whoa.

5852
08:04:27,480 --> 08:04:27,880
La.

5853
08:04:30,360 --> 08:04:31,640
It's red.

5854
08:04:31,640 --> 08:04:33,400
I can see enemies down there.

5855
08:04:35,800 --> 08:04:37,880
Whoa, I see a fire giant too.

5856
08:04:40,520 --> 08:04:41,000
Whoa.

5857
08:04:43,560 --> 08:04:44,840
How did we get there?

5858
08:04:44,840 --> 08:04:46,040
It must be a cavern.

5859
08:04:47,320 --> 08:04:50,520
Oh, it must be, because that's just the freaking bomb of the map.

5860
08:04:51,560 --> 08:04:56,200
The morning coconut is by the red flower.

5861
08:05:01,560 --> 08:05:03,240
Whoa, fuck me.

5862
08:05:03,240 --> 08:05:04,440
Oh my god, that made me jump.

5863
08:05:06,360 --> 08:05:08,360
They've left that in as a body dump too.

5864
08:05:08,920 --> 08:05:09,720
It's working.

5865
08:05:10,520 --> 08:05:11,640
What is that?

5866
08:05:13,960 --> 08:05:15,880
Oh my gosh.

5867
08:05:16,760 --> 08:05:21,240
We've hardly even explored a fraction of this one.

5868
08:05:23,240 --> 08:05:24,520
Right, scour.

5869
08:05:24,520 --> 08:05:25,240
Make your noise.

5870
08:05:31,480 --> 08:05:32,840
Oh, it's a dead dragon.

5871
08:05:32,840 --> 08:05:34,360
Oh, four dragons.

5872
08:05:36,440 --> 08:05:39,400
Oh my gosh.

5873
08:05:40,280 --> 08:05:42,760
I like how the enemies are like spawned in the area

5874
08:05:42,760 --> 08:05:44,920
and they're just waiting to interact with something.

5875
08:05:45,880 --> 08:05:47,000
I find that pretty cool.

5876
08:05:52,200 --> 08:05:53,160
All right.

5877
08:05:54,920 --> 08:05:57,640
Let's just follow this path and see what happens.

5878
08:05:57,640 --> 08:05:59,240
I'm not actually sure what happens,

5879
08:06:00,040 --> 08:06:02,520
but as long as Torrent can carry me through the wind,

5880
08:06:02,520 --> 08:06:03,160
I'll be okay.

5881
08:06:04,040 --> 08:06:06,200
She says with her crossbow bolt out.

5882
08:06:08,120 --> 08:06:11,000
Oh, there's definitely some sort of bridge thing going on over here.

5883
08:06:11,000 --> 08:06:11,560
Hold on.

5884
08:06:12,440 --> 08:06:19,720
See if I can get a marker along the way I'll call you guys in.

5885
08:06:20,840 --> 08:06:22,280
You can explore and foot in.

5886
08:06:23,080 --> 08:06:25,080
There's safety in numbers, I assure you.

5887
08:06:26,600 --> 08:06:28,680
Right, so I discovered that church,

5888
08:06:28,680 --> 08:06:29,880
but I didn't go right.

5889
08:06:31,800 --> 08:06:33,160
If there even is a right.

5890
08:06:35,720 --> 08:06:37,240
Very plausible and going the wrong way.

5891
08:06:39,240 --> 08:06:40,920
But that's never stopped me before.

5892
08:06:40,920 --> 08:06:42,200
Wait, is there a fire giant there?

5893
08:06:44,360 --> 08:06:46,040
No, but there's some sort of settlement.

5894
08:06:47,880 --> 08:06:50,680
If I was a settlement on the cliff edge.

5895
08:06:52,920 --> 08:06:54,920
Oh, whoa.

5896
08:06:54,920 --> 08:06:55,240
Okay.

5897
08:06:55,960 --> 08:06:57,480
I'm definitely not down there.

5898
08:06:58,600 --> 08:06:59,400
Huh.

5899
08:06:59,400 --> 08:07:03,560
Oh, I mean that is the bridge though.

5900
08:07:03,560 --> 08:07:04,120
Is this it?

5901
08:07:04,840 --> 08:07:05,640
I don't want to lose.

5902
08:07:11,080 --> 08:07:14,040
To get down there, you need to head south east along the path.

5903
08:07:25,720 --> 08:07:27,480
I don't think I've unlocked it then.

5904
08:07:29,880 --> 08:07:31,880
Really go down into this watery bit.

5905
08:07:33,080 --> 08:07:34,600
How would I get down there?

5906
08:07:35,480 --> 08:07:38,840
I'm possibly, it looks like there's a,

5907
08:07:39,720 --> 08:07:41,080
yeah, there's a road here.

5908
08:07:42,440 --> 08:07:43,720
How do I get there?

5909
08:07:45,720 --> 08:07:49,320
If I take a right, it looks like I,

5910
08:07:49,320 --> 08:07:51,560
if I take a right and stick to the left or the right,

5911
08:07:51,560 --> 08:07:52,920
then I think it'll be fine.

5912
08:07:55,800 --> 08:07:56,760
There's dragons in.

5913
08:07:57,320 --> 08:07:58,680
Wait, let's see how wrong I am.

5914
08:07:58,680 --> 08:07:59,160
Hold on.

5915
08:07:59,880 --> 08:08:04,120
If I take, if I go this way,

5916
08:08:04,120 --> 08:08:06,120
follow the path but hug the left.

5917
08:08:07,800 --> 08:08:08,360
Let's see.

5918
08:08:09,320 --> 08:08:11,800
If I get horribly wrong, at least we can have a giggle.

5919
08:08:13,800 --> 08:08:16,760
I'm already, wait, this path?

5920
08:08:17,960 --> 08:08:21,080
Okay, that path apparently leads me somewhere.

5921
08:08:25,560 --> 08:08:26,840
They're interested in fighting.

5922
08:08:27,400 --> 08:08:30,840
You growl at someone else, you bunch of furries.

5923
08:08:36,840 --> 08:08:38,280
No way you almost hit that.

5924
08:08:41,400 --> 08:08:43,160
If I hug the left or the right.

5925
08:08:45,320 --> 08:08:47,960
Oh, oh, oh, five head.

5926
08:08:49,640 --> 08:08:52,520
I'm so smart, you could call me a cartographer.

5927
08:08:52,520 --> 08:08:56,040
We did it, we did it.

5928
08:08:56,040 --> 08:08:57,800
Okay, this is where we're supposed to go.

5929
08:09:04,840 --> 08:09:06,040
That's it, that's it.

5930
08:09:06,040 --> 08:09:06,840
Dangerously.

5931
08:09:07,480 --> 08:09:08,840
Okay, to the vats, to the vats.

5932
08:09:10,520 --> 08:09:13,000
Careful, buddies, and then you hurt yourself.

5933
08:09:14,680 --> 08:09:16,440
Don't aggro them too much now.

5934
08:09:18,680 --> 08:09:21,400
Uh, yeah, okay, I see it, I see it.

5935
08:09:22,360 --> 08:09:25,880
Gentle, gentle.

5936
08:09:28,520 --> 08:09:31,720
There, there's a big old cross station down there,

5937
08:09:31,720 --> 08:09:32,520
but that's the thing.

5938
08:09:34,120 --> 08:09:34,920
Gentle.

5939
08:09:36,840 --> 08:09:38,280
Yeah, so gentle.

5940
08:09:39,560 --> 08:09:41,160
We're all friends here.

5941
08:09:42,920 --> 08:09:43,720
Okay, so.

5942
08:09:45,720 --> 08:09:47,160
See, is that cavern?

5943
08:09:48,120 --> 08:09:49,880
There used to be some sort of cavern.

5944
08:09:51,880 --> 08:09:58,120
But if I go up here, there might be a rest spot.

5945
08:09:59,080 --> 08:10:01,880
Whoa, whoa, careful, baby, don't get poisoned.

5946
08:10:07,160 --> 08:10:08,520
Wow, I see them.

5947
08:10:08,520 --> 08:10:10,680
Wow, this is Poison Avenue.

5948
08:10:10,680 --> 08:10:11,320
Oh, dear.

5949
08:10:11,880 --> 08:10:12,920
Torrent, can you claim this?

5950
08:10:13,640 --> 08:10:14,920
Torrent, claim this cliff right now.

5951
08:10:14,920 --> 08:10:16,520
Oh, God, Torrent, you're so smart.

5952
08:10:17,320 --> 08:10:18,280
You're like a wreathling.

5953
08:10:20,120 --> 08:10:25,880
Okay, I don't see any implication of a safe site.

5954
08:10:27,000 --> 08:10:28,600
And that's how something is there.

5955
08:10:33,640 --> 08:10:34,140
Huh.

5956
08:10:38,040 --> 08:10:40,280
Ah, wait, if I keep going this way,

5957
08:10:40,280 --> 08:10:42,280
there'll be something ahead.

5958
08:10:42,280 --> 08:10:44,520
Just need to try and avoid the poison.

5959
08:10:45,160 --> 08:10:47,640
But there also is, like, there's something over here.

5960
08:10:51,240 --> 08:10:52,520
But not a safe site?

5961
08:10:55,960 --> 08:10:56,920
Maybe a cavern?

5962
08:11:00,840 --> 08:11:03,240
Okay, well, yes, we're just looking for one safe site.

5963
08:11:05,240 --> 08:11:08,600
Uh, I think that's a path up.

5964
08:11:11,880 --> 08:11:13,640
Torrent is immune to poison?

5965
08:11:14,360 --> 08:11:14,860
Oh.

5966
08:11:16,680 --> 08:11:18,680
Torrent, your shoes are green.

5967
08:11:20,440 --> 08:11:21,320
Wait, what?

5968
08:11:21,320 --> 08:11:21,800
Am I just-

5969
08:11:23,240 --> 08:11:24,840
Oh, I'm just freaking going backwards.

5970
08:11:24,840 --> 08:11:26,280
Right, sorry, pardon me, excuse me.

5971
08:11:26,840 --> 08:11:29,160
It looks like there's more than one way to get to this area.

5972
08:11:30,040 --> 08:11:31,080
My apologies.

5973
08:11:31,080 --> 08:11:35,080
But it's per hoops are green for a baby.

5974
08:11:35,080 --> 08:11:36,600
I didn't mean to paint them green.

5975
08:11:38,440 --> 08:11:39,240
Can you paint?

5976
08:11:39,240 --> 08:11:42,120
You must be able, yeah, because horses, shoes,

5977
08:11:42,760 --> 08:11:44,600
horses' nails are, like, the same thing.

5978
08:11:45,480 --> 08:11:47,720
So in theory, you can give a horse a pedicure,

5979
08:11:47,720 --> 08:11:49,640
which is hilarious if you think about it.

5980
08:11:57,640 --> 08:12:00,440
Oh, they must do it for sure, horses, actually.

5981
08:12:01,400 --> 08:12:02,840
There's a wind current.

5982
08:12:05,560 --> 08:12:06,680
I want to go up.

5983
08:12:07,080 --> 08:12:11,080
Uh, I am...

5984
08:12:12,440 --> 08:12:14,440
I can almost come back down a wind current.

5985
08:12:14,440 --> 08:12:16,680
Wait, it's not a wind current?

5986
08:12:18,920 --> 08:12:20,120
Am I being vagus?

5987
08:12:20,120 --> 08:12:20,920
It's not a wind current.

5988
08:12:22,120 --> 08:12:24,520
Why are you- I have no idea.

5989
08:12:24,520 --> 08:12:25,020
Okay.

5990
08:12:28,520 --> 08:12:30,360
You just have to care for me.

5991
08:12:30,520 --> 08:12:36,520
Because we have adapted the animals for our knee.

5992
08:12:36,520 --> 08:12:39,080
Yeah, so now they require special care.

5993
08:12:41,080 --> 08:12:42,520
Thousand of dread.

5994
08:12:42,520 --> 08:12:43,640
That sounds pretty cool.

5995
08:12:43,640 --> 08:12:44,280
Not gonna lie.

5996
08:12:51,400 --> 08:12:51,880
Then...

5997
08:12:53,160 --> 08:12:54,920
Raise this potency of magma.

5998
08:12:56,680 --> 08:12:58,200
Magma is dread, please.

5999
08:12:58,200 --> 08:12:58,680
Oh, hello.

6000
08:12:59,320 --> 08:13:00,040
Is this your house?

6001
08:13:01,000 --> 08:13:05,320
Bubble, thank you for coming, a member.

6002
08:13:06,600 --> 08:13:08,600
Enjoy this, me, the memory page.

6003
08:13:10,680 --> 08:13:12,840
Old Baal, Tyrant Drake.

6004
08:13:13,720 --> 08:13:15,240
Uh, it's a dragon.

6005
08:13:16,840 --> 08:13:19,960
Is your fury still yet to crest its zenith?

6006
08:13:20,680 --> 08:13:22,520
Hurry, hurry, and lay it all to waste.

6007
08:13:22,520 --> 08:13:25,160
Lay waste to the proud, the conceited,

6008
08:13:25,160 --> 08:13:27,640
each every last one of that arrogant law.

6009
08:13:28,600 --> 08:13:36,600
Huh, no, this is definitely a dead end crossing, right?

6010
08:13:43,480 --> 08:13:44,680
So how do we keep that?

6011
08:13:49,560 --> 08:13:50,760
Thank you for coming, a member.

6012
08:13:50,760 --> 08:13:51,240
Bubbles!

6013
08:13:53,320 --> 08:13:54,200
Are there any bubbles?

6014
08:13:55,160 --> 08:13:55,800
Who are you?

6015
08:13:56,760 --> 08:13:59,000
I didn't expect his tongue.

6016
08:14:00,360 --> 08:14:01,560
Try attacking.

6017
08:14:02,680 --> 08:14:05,160
I mean, yes.

6018
08:14:09,400 --> 08:14:09,880
Where y'all?

6019
08:14:15,480 --> 08:14:17,960
Oh, somewhere.

6020
08:14:19,640 --> 08:14:20,440
Oh, wait, sorry.

6021
08:14:22,120 --> 08:14:23,960
I don't think any of you are gonna be here by...

6022
08:14:23,960 --> 08:14:25,400
Wait, there's nothing here.

6023
08:14:26,760 --> 08:14:29,000
Okay, there's nothing here but we mushroom.

6024
08:14:30,440 --> 08:14:31,240
That's fine.

6025
08:14:31,240 --> 08:14:33,640
And then we take the skywind up.

6026
08:14:35,160 --> 08:14:36,520
Legend of Zelda style.

6027
08:14:38,280 --> 08:14:40,040
And then we go upsy-pupsy.

6028
08:14:43,160 --> 08:14:45,080
And then we go upsy-pupsy.

6029
08:14:47,560 --> 08:14:48,360
Whoa!

6030
08:14:50,200 --> 08:14:53,000
Tyrant, Tyrant, don't you get a little,

6031
08:14:53,000 --> 08:14:55,160
like, feel a little sick doing that?

6032
08:14:55,240 --> 08:14:58,200
No? No, that doesn't faze you at all.

6033
08:15:04,920 --> 08:15:06,200
Feel like anything special?

6034
08:15:06,200 --> 08:15:06,600
No.

6035
08:15:07,480 --> 08:15:08,440
Upsy-pupsy!

6036
08:15:10,360 --> 08:15:11,800
Jeez, Lois!

6037
08:15:18,840 --> 08:15:20,040
I'm in a castle.

6038
08:15:21,640 --> 08:15:22,680
I'm in a castle.

6039
08:15:23,320 --> 08:15:24,440
Oh, wait, is anyone here?

6040
08:15:25,720 --> 08:15:26,280
No.

6041
08:15:27,480 --> 08:15:31,160
We have unlocked a fort of Reprimands.

6042
08:15:32,360 --> 08:15:33,720
That's where you go when you misbehave.

6043
08:15:33,720 --> 08:15:35,720
You go into Shibi's fort of Reprimands.

6044
08:15:36,440 --> 08:15:37,720
Hydration check.

6045
08:15:37,720 --> 08:15:38,280
I'm a...

6046
08:15:39,160 --> 08:15:41,720
Tyrant just jumping entire mountains like it's nothing.

6047
08:15:42,760 --> 08:15:43,240
Mmm.

6048
08:15:48,920 --> 08:15:49,240
Okay.

6049
08:15:51,560 --> 08:15:52,920
We're in fort Reprimand

6050
08:15:52,920 --> 08:15:57,240
and the teleportation is called behind the fort of Reprimands.

6051
08:15:57,240 --> 08:15:59,640
I'm allowed to call you guys in because I've not defeated it.

6052
08:16:01,000 --> 08:16:02,840
My face turned out one leafling is here.

6053
08:16:02,840 --> 08:16:03,240
Um...

6054
08:16:04,440 --> 08:16:06,200
Oh, I just burped out of nervousness.

6055
08:16:06,200 --> 08:16:06,840
Um...

6056
08:16:06,840 --> 08:16:07,640
Oh, wait, it's because...

6057
08:16:08,360 --> 08:16:09,320
No, it's that because...

6058
08:16:10,360 --> 08:16:11,320
So it should show up.

6059
08:16:13,160 --> 08:16:14,600
Wait, Beel's not in the fort.

6060
08:16:14,600 --> 08:16:15,640
Oh, am I going the wrong way?

6061
08:16:16,760 --> 08:16:18,600
Well, we did bit of exploring that we did today.

6062
08:16:20,760 --> 08:16:21,960
We'll be there, give us a second.

6063
08:16:22,040 --> 08:16:23,480
Give us a second, let us show up.

6064
08:16:23,480 --> 08:16:24,760
Okay, there we go, there we go, there we go.

6065
08:16:25,240 --> 08:16:26,360
Uh, right, I've got...

6066
08:16:27,800 --> 08:16:30,680
I think we're all limited to have any reefing to come in.

6067
08:16:31,480 --> 08:16:32,840
Is there any enemy reefing?

6068
08:16:33,560 --> 08:16:34,520
I've got enemies.

6069
08:16:34,520 --> 08:16:35,960
Got a lot of enemies.

6070
08:16:35,960 --> 08:16:36,760
Got enemies.

6071
08:16:36,760 --> 08:16:37,880
Yeah, a lot of enemies.

6072
08:16:39,880 --> 08:16:41,560
I've been main being mummies.

6073
08:16:41,560 --> 08:16:44,760
And mummies for a reprimandation, honestly.

6074
08:16:46,200 --> 08:16:48,680
I think it's just called a panini press, to be honest.

6075
08:16:50,280 --> 08:16:51,720
The fort is cool, yeah.

6076
08:16:51,720 --> 08:16:54,920
Maybe we'll do the fort, and then I'll see if we want to keep going or not.

6077
08:16:55,560 --> 08:16:56,920
I'll gauge interest.

6078
08:16:56,920 --> 08:16:58,520
I've got an enemy reefing.

6079
08:16:58,520 --> 08:16:59,400
I've got enemies.

6080
08:17:03,400 --> 08:17:04,600
Okay, let's hope you get it again.

6081
08:17:04,600 --> 08:17:06,760
Okay, we've got one reefling.

6082
08:17:06,760 --> 08:17:08,840
We've got two reefling.

6083
08:17:08,840 --> 08:17:10,360
And for the third reefling.

6084
08:17:10,920 --> 08:17:12,120
Behold!

6085
08:17:12,120 --> 08:17:13,800
The third reefling!

6086
08:17:13,800 --> 08:17:15,080
Right now, spawn in...

6087
08:17:15,080 --> 08:17:15,560
Right now.

6088
08:17:16,520 --> 08:17:18,280
Spawning right before me.

6089
08:17:23,160 --> 08:17:25,400
Rise, ye reefling!

6090
08:17:25,400 --> 08:17:26,040
Rise!

6091
08:17:27,080 --> 08:17:28,120
Are you whimpering?

6092
08:17:29,880 --> 08:17:30,760
Goat, goat, goat, goat.

6093
08:17:32,360 --> 08:17:33,160
Goat, goat, goat.

6094
08:17:33,160 --> 08:17:34,520
When she keeps talking.

6095
08:17:37,800 --> 08:17:39,640
Okay, let's see what we're dealing with.

6096
08:17:41,560 --> 08:17:43,000
One's whimpering, one's got...

6097
08:17:43,000 --> 08:17:44,520
You are beautiful.

6098
08:17:44,520 --> 08:17:45,880
We do need to get all the coconuts.

6099
08:17:45,880 --> 08:17:47,080
We can all talk to each other.

6100
08:17:55,400 --> 08:17:56,600
You are beautiful.

6101
08:18:01,000 --> 08:18:02,120
Wah!

6102
08:18:02,120 --> 08:18:03,560
Some bell stone.

6103
08:18:05,240 --> 08:18:07,240
No, just no more sinking stone.

6104
08:18:07,800 --> 08:18:09,720
I still need to see some bell stone.

6105
08:18:14,520 --> 08:18:16,120
I like how the coconut's done so evil.

6106
08:18:16,120 --> 08:18:16,600
But he's like...

6107
08:18:18,120 --> 08:18:18,440
Eh?

6108
08:18:20,680 --> 08:18:21,320
Eh?

6109
08:18:21,320 --> 08:18:22,440
That reefling needs help?

6110
08:18:23,160 --> 08:18:23,400
Oh.

6111
08:18:25,320 --> 08:18:28,920
Can anyone catch some sort of distance thing from here?

6112
08:18:32,440 --> 08:18:32,760
Woah!

6113
08:18:34,840 --> 08:18:35,560
Yeah, yeah.

6114
08:18:37,880 --> 08:18:39,720
Oh, he's making it rain lightning.

6115
08:18:40,440 --> 08:18:41,640
He is raging.

6116
08:18:41,640 --> 08:18:42,680
Is that a giant?

6117
08:18:45,160 --> 08:18:46,600
We're in the middle of a fight.

6118
08:18:48,680 --> 08:18:49,880
He is raging.

6119
08:18:49,880 --> 08:18:50,600
Is he okay?

6120
08:18:51,960 --> 08:18:52,680
He's...

6121
08:18:52,680 --> 08:18:53,160
Woah!

6122
08:18:53,160 --> 08:18:53,640
Careful!

6123
08:18:55,080 --> 08:18:56,280
Oh, now we need to jump him!

6124
08:18:56,280 --> 08:18:57,080
Jump him!

6125
08:18:57,080 --> 08:18:58,040
Make him regret it!

6126
08:18:58,040 --> 08:18:58,920
Make him regret it!

6127
08:18:59,480 --> 08:19:00,680
Okay, we're good.

6128
08:19:00,680 --> 08:19:01,160
We're good.

6129
08:19:03,080 --> 08:19:04,200
We jumped him.

6130
08:19:04,200 --> 08:19:05,400
A broken room.

6131
08:19:07,080 --> 08:19:08,520
Okay, we managed to jump him.

6132
08:19:10,120 --> 08:19:10,680
Reeflings.

6133
08:19:12,120 --> 08:19:13,160
Spit rows that man.

6134
08:19:15,480 --> 08:19:16,520
Oh, he didn't touch me.

6135
08:19:17,800 --> 08:19:18,760
I have touched...

6136
08:19:19,560 --> 08:19:20,840
I have touched you, okay.

6137
08:19:22,680 --> 08:19:25,240
Flirting with straw and he's biting enemies right next to you.

6138
08:19:26,360 --> 08:19:26,920
What were you?

6139
08:19:26,920 --> 08:19:27,880
You see?

6140
08:19:27,880 --> 08:19:28,840
I go the wrong way.

6141
08:19:33,560 --> 08:19:35,480
You guys have only had access to this...

6142
08:19:39,320 --> 08:19:40,680
What's going on in there?

6143
08:19:42,520 --> 08:19:43,400
Oh, there's a knight!

6144
08:19:43,400 --> 08:19:44,040
There's a knight!

6145
08:19:44,040 --> 08:19:44,440
Careful!

6146
08:19:44,440 --> 08:19:45,080
There's a knight!

6147
08:19:45,080 --> 08:19:45,560
There's a knight!

6148
08:19:47,000 --> 08:19:47,240
He's...

6149
08:19:48,040 --> 08:19:48,440
Stop!

6150
08:19:48,440 --> 08:19:49,560
I'm whimpering too!

6151
08:19:49,560 --> 08:19:50,360
I'm scared!

6152
08:19:51,640 --> 08:19:52,520
Oh my god.

6153
08:19:52,520 --> 08:19:53,640
Woah!

6154
08:19:53,640 --> 08:19:54,760
Oh my god, he's got a jewel!

6155
08:19:54,760 --> 08:19:55,800
It's a freaking...

6156
08:19:55,800 --> 08:19:56,360
What's it?

6157
08:19:56,360 --> 08:19:57,480
Darth Maul?

6158
08:19:57,480 --> 08:19:59,720
When he has two sides of his lightsaber?

6159
08:20:02,040 --> 08:20:02,920
Oh my god!

6160
08:20:04,760 --> 08:20:05,640
Fuck him up!

6161
08:20:06,520 --> 08:20:08,280
Don't let him breathe!

6162
08:20:08,280 --> 08:20:09,720
He has terrible points!

6163
08:20:10,520 --> 08:20:11,720
He should be ashamed!

6164
08:20:13,480 --> 08:20:16,440
Call yourself a knight and you can't handle three on one?

6165
08:20:16,440 --> 08:20:17,080
What do you mean?

6166
08:20:17,080 --> 08:20:18,280
It's not fair!

6167
08:20:18,280 --> 08:20:20,040
I will not listen to your pleas!

6168
08:20:20,040 --> 08:20:21,640
I will not listen to your ignorance!

6169
08:20:24,520 --> 08:20:25,080
Oh shh!

6170
08:20:26,520 --> 08:20:27,560
He's a phoenix!

6171
08:20:28,280 --> 08:20:30,920
You little stinker team!

6172
08:20:30,920 --> 08:20:31,960
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

6173
08:20:31,960 --> 08:20:33,240
Hold on, mummy needs to heal.

6174
08:20:34,120 --> 08:20:35,480
And rest her stamina.

6175
08:20:36,840 --> 08:20:37,480
Okay, there we go.

6176
08:20:38,440 --> 08:20:39,800
Black knight, yeah.

6177
08:20:40,840 --> 08:20:41,400
What's it?

6178
08:20:41,400 --> 08:20:41,960
Edridge?

6179
08:20:43,480 --> 08:20:44,120
Jumping.

6180
08:20:45,640 --> 08:20:46,360
Enemy fell.

6181
08:20:46,360 --> 08:20:48,200
You guys aren't going to despawn through his enemy.

6182
08:20:48,200 --> 08:20:49,720
It wasn't a god, it was enemy.

6183
08:20:51,160 --> 08:20:52,440
Please tell me you guys don't despair.

6184
08:20:53,640 --> 08:20:54,680
Please tell me you don't despair.

6185
08:20:54,680 --> 08:20:55,240
No!

6186
08:20:55,240 --> 08:20:55,880
Wait, I'm going back.

6187
08:20:55,880 --> 08:20:57,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, don't care.

6188
08:20:57,000 --> 08:20:57,640
Don't care.

6189
08:20:57,640 --> 08:20:58,680
I actually don't care, I'm going back.

6190
08:21:00,360 --> 08:21:01,800
Oh my god, streamers too scared to play games?

6191
08:21:01,800 --> 08:21:02,040
Yeah?

6192
08:21:02,760 --> 08:21:03,560
What happens next?

6193
08:21:04,520 --> 08:21:06,760
What happens next if streamers too scared to play games?

6194
08:21:08,520 --> 08:21:09,560
That was the boss.

6195
08:21:11,320 --> 08:21:12,200
In this castle?

6196
08:21:14,360 --> 08:21:15,720
Wait, so I can't...

6197
08:21:16,840 --> 08:21:19,160
More like, black and bruised knight?

6198
08:21:19,160 --> 08:21:19,720
Am I right?

6199
08:21:25,080 --> 08:21:26,520
So what was my reward?

6200
08:21:28,440 --> 08:21:29,960
Oh, other than failing an enemy.

6201
08:21:38,600 --> 08:21:40,040
No, my ears can hear that.

6202
08:21:40,040 --> 08:21:41,720
No, sorry, I have hearing.

6203
08:21:41,720 --> 08:21:42,120
I'm not.

6204
08:21:43,080 --> 08:21:43,880
I ain't doing it.

6205
08:21:44,600 --> 08:21:46,600
I don't care what's up there, it ain't that important.

6206
08:21:47,720 --> 08:21:49,000
There's a chest up that ladder,

6207
08:21:49,000 --> 08:21:50,760
there's also something creeping around up there.

6208
08:21:50,760 --> 08:21:51,480
I'm not risking it.

6209
08:21:53,880 --> 08:21:55,960
I can feel my soul leaving my body.

6210
08:21:55,960 --> 08:21:57,160
What, because I have bad?

6211
08:21:57,160 --> 08:21:58,600
Go back to the castle front.

6212
08:22:00,520 --> 08:22:01,400
Castle front.

6213
08:22:06,280 --> 08:22:07,160
Castle front.

6214
08:22:09,960 --> 08:22:11,160
I've got a shadow key.

6215
08:22:13,000 --> 08:22:15,320
I don't have a castle for fun.

6216
08:22:15,320 --> 08:22:16,440
Am I being perfectly good?

6217
08:22:16,440 --> 08:22:18,200
The grace castle front.

6218
08:22:18,200 --> 08:22:19,720
The grace castle front.

6219
08:22:23,800 --> 08:22:25,080
Castle front.

6220
08:22:25,080 --> 08:22:26,280
Ming deep further.

6221
08:22:26,280 --> 08:22:27,640
Is this the castle front?

6222
08:22:30,040 --> 08:22:31,240
Castle you fought really?

6223
08:22:31,240 --> 08:22:32,120
That doesn't help me.

6224
08:22:32,120 --> 08:22:33,480
You need a name to say.

6225
08:22:33,480 --> 08:22:34,200
That doesn't help me.

6226
08:22:34,200 --> 08:22:34,840
I'm useless though.

6227
08:22:34,840 --> 08:22:35,320
I don't know.

6228
08:22:37,480 --> 08:22:39,960
That was the lion, so it's not this one.

6229
08:22:40,520 --> 08:22:42,680
Oh, got it.

6230
08:22:44,120 --> 08:22:45,160
I got it.

6231
08:22:45,160 --> 08:22:45,720
Sorry.

6232
08:22:45,720 --> 08:22:46,840
Take me a second there.

6233
08:22:48,760 --> 08:22:49,800
I'm bad, okay?

6234
08:22:49,800 --> 08:22:51,880
I'm tired, I'm tired.

6235
08:22:53,080 --> 08:22:53,960
I'm tired, baby.

6236
08:23:01,080 --> 08:23:03,240
You guys better be coming in and saving me.

6237
08:23:03,240 --> 08:23:04,680
Oh, sorry, sorry.

6238
08:23:05,800 --> 08:23:07,160
Go back side to sit down there.

6239
08:23:07,960 --> 08:23:09,960
In come.

6240
08:23:11,640 --> 08:23:13,160
Save me from the enemies, I guess.

6241
08:23:14,520 --> 08:23:15,960
There's an enemy, isn't it?

6242
08:23:15,960 --> 08:23:17,560
I can hear something like through the wind.

6243
08:23:20,280 --> 08:23:22,600
Faultfish in the bad direction, honestly.

6244
08:23:24,200 --> 08:23:25,000
Waman moment.

6245
08:23:26,760 --> 08:23:28,200
Good luck everybody else.

6246
08:23:28,200 --> 08:23:29,000
I'm turning left.

6247
08:23:30,920 --> 08:23:32,840
Well, there's a few more reeflings in this section.

6248
08:23:32,840 --> 08:23:34,360
Who's not had a shot to clean a bit?

6249
08:23:35,320 --> 08:23:37,400
Uh, Alessandro...

6250
08:23:37,400 --> 08:23:39,000
Oh, crap, you've not had a shot, has it?

6251
08:23:40,200 --> 08:23:40,760
And then...

6252
08:23:43,000 --> 08:23:47,160
I want to find Pineapple and...

6253
08:23:47,160 --> 08:23:49,400
I think Shalamping was last, and then Pineapple, your next.

6254
08:23:51,560 --> 08:23:53,000
It's cute when you get lost.

6255
08:23:54,040 --> 08:23:54,840
Not frustrating.

6256
08:24:00,120 --> 08:24:01,320
The rituals, okay?

6257
08:24:01,320 --> 08:24:03,320
Even though it's exploration, so I guess

6258
08:24:04,040 --> 08:24:05,160
it's not much.

6259
08:24:05,160 --> 08:24:07,400
As soon as you come in, hand me your best shot, boom.

6260
08:24:10,520 --> 08:24:13,000
Hand me your best shot, as soon as you come in, boom.

6261
08:24:14,440 --> 08:24:15,000
I kneel.

6262
08:24:16,120 --> 08:24:16,600
I kneel.

6263
08:24:16,600 --> 08:24:17,960
Allow me to carry you.

6264
08:24:17,960 --> 08:24:19,960
Yes, I give you permission to carry me.

6265
08:24:20,680 --> 08:24:21,960
Okay, where the heck are we going?

6266
08:24:24,360 --> 08:24:25,480
Do I stop that whimpering?

6267
08:24:25,480 --> 08:24:26,520
Right, we're to go west.

6268
08:24:28,040 --> 08:24:29,880
Ooh, I see it now.

6269
08:24:29,880 --> 08:24:33,080
I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it.

6270
08:24:33,080 --> 08:24:34,280
This map is getting big.

6271
08:24:35,880 --> 08:24:36,920
Okay, we have a light.

6272
08:24:36,920 --> 08:24:37,880
Follow the beacon!

6273
08:24:49,640 --> 08:24:50,840
I thought we had to go west.

6274
08:24:52,360 --> 08:24:53,240
I meant south east.

6275
08:24:53,240 --> 08:24:53,800
Ah!

6276
08:24:53,800 --> 08:24:55,240
South was the jargon.

6277
08:24:56,280 --> 08:24:58,440
Just run past any enemy.

6278
08:24:58,440 --> 08:25:00,120
Got a lot of enemies.

6279
08:25:00,120 --> 08:25:01,080
Got enemies.

6280
08:25:01,720 --> 08:25:03,400
They well fistrode at you.

6281
08:25:05,000 --> 08:25:07,080
But I just ignore them.

6282
08:25:09,480 --> 08:25:10,920
Move it ahead for me, even more.

6283
08:25:11,960 --> 08:25:13,480
Okay, keep a move on, Reefland.

6284
08:25:15,160 --> 08:25:16,200
They're jumping us!

6285
08:25:23,160 --> 08:25:23,560
Ah!

6286
08:25:26,840 --> 08:25:27,720
Oh, man, it's coming.

6287
08:25:29,480 --> 08:25:30,280
Oh, flowers.

6288
08:25:31,720 --> 08:25:32,520
Are you guys okay?

6289
08:25:32,520 --> 08:25:33,640
Yes, how much you guys are okay?

6290
08:25:34,920 --> 08:25:40,360
I need to get those glowstones that do something.

6291
08:25:42,520 --> 08:25:43,240
Are they scared?

6292
08:25:45,400 --> 08:25:46,440
Is it gonna run away?

6293
08:25:49,560 --> 08:25:50,360
I'm so fine.

6294
08:25:52,440 --> 08:25:53,880
Take her to the priest there.

6295
08:25:55,400 --> 08:25:58,040
I just want to know who the next thing...

6296
08:25:58,040 --> 08:25:58,360
Whoa!

6297
08:25:59,320 --> 08:26:00,680
Something's after me.

6298
08:26:00,680 --> 08:26:01,720
I'm not looking behind.

6299
08:26:01,720 --> 08:26:03,080
I've got enough stamina to keep going.

6300
08:26:04,360 --> 08:26:04,680
Oh, wait.

6301
08:26:04,680 --> 08:26:06,040
One of the Reeflings are half health.

6302
08:26:06,040 --> 08:26:07,560
Wait, I think the Reeflings are getting jumped.

6303
08:26:12,280 --> 08:26:14,520
Both the Reeflings are getting jumped like holy hell.

6304
08:26:15,480 --> 08:26:16,440
I think maybe...

6305
08:26:16,440 --> 08:26:17,960
I think maybe we should have teamed up.

6306
08:26:19,480 --> 08:26:20,120
And four.

6307
08:26:20,120 --> 08:26:21,320
Are you guys gonna make it?

6308
08:26:21,320 --> 08:26:21,880
I'm scared.

6309
08:26:23,960 --> 08:26:24,360
I don't know.

6310
08:26:24,360 --> 08:26:25,480
Okay, we've got one healed up.

6311
08:26:25,480 --> 08:26:28,920
Are you guys...

6312
08:26:28,920 --> 08:26:30,120
Are you not able to run past?

6313
08:26:31,880 --> 08:26:34,360
There's an enemy to your right coming up.

6314
08:26:36,440 --> 08:26:37,080
To your right.

6315
08:26:37,080 --> 08:26:38,280
Just run past if you can.

6316
08:26:41,720 --> 08:26:42,840
Wait, the worms are...

6317
08:26:42,840 --> 08:26:43,800
Have health bars?

6318
08:26:43,800 --> 08:26:44,840
Oh, don't hurt the worms.

6319
08:26:44,840 --> 08:26:45,320
They're cute.

6320
08:26:50,040 --> 08:26:50,360
Ah!

6321
08:26:51,000 --> 08:26:51,960
I hear you healing.

6322
08:26:55,480 --> 08:26:57,480
Ah!

6323
08:26:57,480 --> 08:26:59,480
Ah!

6324
08:26:59,480 --> 08:27:01,480
Ah!

6325
08:27:01,480 --> 08:27:03,480
Ah!

6326
08:27:03,480 --> 08:27:05,480
Ah!

6327
08:27:05,480 --> 08:27:07,480
Ah!

6328
08:27:07,480 --> 08:27:09,480
Ah!

6329
08:27:09,480 --> 08:27:11,480
Pain.

6330
08:27:11,480 --> 08:27:13,480
Pain.

6331
08:27:13,480 --> 08:27:15,480
My arms.

6332
08:27:15,480 --> 08:27:17,480
My legs.

6333
08:27:17,480 --> 08:27:19,480
Each light a bloody ruin.

6334
08:27:21,480 --> 08:27:23,480
Bail!

6335
08:27:23,480 --> 08:27:25,480
Bail Bail.

6336
08:27:25,480 --> 08:27:29,480
Oh, terror incarnate.

6337
08:27:29,480 --> 08:27:33,480
There is life in me yet.

6338
08:27:33,480 --> 08:27:37,480
I will soon feast upon your heart.

6339
08:27:37,480 --> 08:27:39,480
Mark my words.

6340
08:27:39,480 --> 08:27:43,480
You too shall know fear.

6341
08:27:43,480 --> 08:27:47,480
Ah!

6342
08:27:53,480 --> 08:27:57,480
Oh, the pain.

6343
08:28:01,480 --> 08:28:03,480
The exquisite pain.

6344
08:28:09,480 --> 08:28:11,480
Okay, we're in dialysis.

6345
08:28:11,480 --> 08:28:13,480
That, I was like,

6346
08:28:13,480 --> 08:28:15,480
I'm pretty sure it's not that kind of game,

6347
08:28:15,480 --> 08:28:17,480
but that's how I want you guys to win for him.

6348
08:28:19,480 --> 08:28:21,480
That's what I want to be hearing.

6349
08:28:23,480 --> 08:28:25,480
Oh!

6350
08:28:25,480 --> 08:28:27,480
Oh!

6351
08:28:27,480 --> 08:28:29,480
Oh!

6352
08:28:29,480 --> 08:28:31,480
Mommy, are you in thrall?

6353
08:28:31,480 --> 08:28:33,480
Am I allowed to be?

6354
08:28:35,480 --> 08:28:37,480
She wants us to send.

6355
08:28:37,480 --> 08:28:41,480
Other than the pain part, I don't want to cause any pain.

6356
08:28:47,480 --> 08:28:49,480
Okay.

6357
08:28:49,480 --> 08:28:51,480
It seemed rather safe.

6358
08:28:53,480 --> 08:28:55,480
It's rather dark around these parts.

6359
08:28:55,480 --> 08:28:57,480
Let me pop a wee light on,

6360
08:28:57,480 --> 08:28:59,480
just so we can see what we're doing.

6361
08:29:03,480 --> 08:29:05,480
Okay.

6362
08:29:05,480 --> 08:29:07,480
Statue's coming alive, that's fine.

6363
08:29:07,480 --> 08:29:09,480
Jump on.

6364
08:29:09,480 --> 08:29:11,480
Are you squidding me right now?

6365
08:29:11,480 --> 08:29:13,480
But stomp my face, anime woman.

6366
08:29:15,480 --> 08:29:17,480
Yes, awesome.

6367
08:29:17,480 --> 08:29:19,480
Thank you for the two.

6368
08:29:19,480 --> 08:29:21,480
Oh, butt stomp!

6369
08:29:21,480 --> 08:29:23,480
I thought you meant butt.

6370
08:29:23,480 --> 08:29:25,480
Is that like a question?

6371
08:29:25,480 --> 08:29:27,480
Yeah.

6372
08:29:27,480 --> 08:29:29,480
You're more than welcome.

6373
08:29:29,480 --> 08:29:31,480
Oh no!

6374
08:29:31,480 --> 08:29:33,480
But then you can come back.

6375
08:29:33,480 --> 08:29:35,480
That's my face!

6376
08:29:35,480 --> 08:29:37,480
Oh my god, look!

6377
08:29:37,480 --> 08:29:39,480
It's my face as player model!

6378
08:29:39,480 --> 08:29:41,480
Check it out!

6379
08:29:41,480 --> 08:29:43,480
I got eyes, but aren't eyes?

6380
08:29:43,480 --> 08:29:45,480
Oh!

6381
08:29:45,480 --> 08:29:47,480
Wow!

6382
08:29:47,480 --> 08:29:49,480
It's kind of cool to see the inside mechanics

6383
08:29:49,480 --> 08:29:51,480
that we lost in the first place.

6384
08:29:53,480 --> 08:29:55,480
Thank you for you.

6385
08:29:55,480 --> 08:29:57,480
I can't progress unless all gone.

6386
08:29:57,480 --> 08:29:59,480
If you click multiplayer and then press Duff Finger,

6387
08:29:59,480 --> 08:30:01,480
it's like multiplayer

6388
08:30:01,480 --> 08:30:03,480
and then hit the finger saber.

6389
08:30:03,480 --> 08:30:05,480
I don't want to kick, I feel like...

6390
08:30:11,480 --> 08:30:13,480
Let's see.

6391
08:30:13,480 --> 08:30:15,480
What's behind cave number one?

6392
08:30:15,480 --> 08:30:17,480
Dragon's Pit.

6393
08:30:17,480 --> 08:30:19,480
Okay.

6394
08:30:19,480 --> 08:30:21,480
I don't know if I got reason to use this one.

6395
08:30:21,480 --> 08:30:23,480
Ain't it nice?

6396
08:30:23,480 --> 08:30:25,480
Ain't it just grand?

6397
08:30:25,480 --> 08:30:27,480
I need some.

6398
08:30:29,480 --> 08:30:31,480
Wait a minute.

6399
08:30:31,480 --> 08:30:33,480
We're in a place called

6400
08:30:33,480 --> 08:30:35,480
Dragon's Pit today.

6401
08:30:35,480 --> 08:30:37,480
Norm, have you had a show?

6402
08:30:37,480 --> 08:30:39,480
I don't think...

6403
08:30:39,480 --> 08:30:41,480
I think Norm and then Oz.

6404
08:30:41,480 --> 08:30:43,480
Again, if I forget the order,

6405
08:30:43,480 --> 08:30:45,480
I'm really sorry.

6406
08:30:46,480 --> 08:30:48,480
Can't summon in there.

6407
08:30:48,480 --> 08:30:50,480
At least I couldn't.

6408
08:30:52,480 --> 08:30:54,480
They may have done some quiet

6409
08:30:54,480 --> 08:30:56,480
hot patches, possibly.

6410
08:30:56,480 --> 08:30:58,480
I don't know.

6411
08:30:58,480 --> 08:31:00,480
For like quick fixes like that.

6412
08:31:00,480 --> 08:31:02,480
I assume the area...

6413
08:31:02,480 --> 08:31:04,480
He's not the thinker!

6414
08:31:04,480 --> 08:31:06,480
Nice job, Lazer.

6415
08:31:06,480 --> 08:31:08,480
One step closer to getting a screaming coconut.

6416
08:31:08,480 --> 08:31:10,480
So I need to say she's got a bit of diamonds, so...

6417
08:31:12,480 --> 08:31:14,480
Yeah?

6418
08:31:14,480 --> 08:31:16,480
What are you gonna do? You fart?

6419
08:31:16,480 --> 08:31:18,480
I need to kiss other leaflings.

6420
08:31:22,480 --> 08:31:24,480
Wait, I'll call up to you. Get ready.

6421
08:31:24,480 --> 08:31:26,480
And then I need to kiss you.

6422
08:31:26,480 --> 08:31:28,480
No! Oh, there's enemies everywhere!

6423
08:31:28,480 --> 08:31:30,480
Hold on, I'm trying to kiss the leaflings.

6424
08:31:30,480 --> 08:31:32,480
Don't be so rude.

6425
08:31:32,480 --> 08:31:34,480
Whoa, there's one behind us!

6426
08:31:34,480 --> 08:31:36,480
Chase!

6427
08:31:39,480 --> 08:31:41,480
Are we okay?

6428
08:31:41,480 --> 08:31:43,480
Everyone okay?

6429
08:31:43,480 --> 08:31:45,480
Oh, there's a fake wall here.

6430
08:31:45,480 --> 08:31:47,480
Oh wait, that's not a fake wall.

6431
08:31:47,480 --> 08:31:49,480
Dung ahead, as in nothing ahead?

6432
08:31:51,480 --> 08:31:54,480
Okay, soothing stone level one.

6433
08:31:54,480 --> 08:31:56,480
Yeah, maybe it is dung ahead.

6434
08:31:56,480 --> 08:31:58,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! He's back?

6435
08:31:58,480 --> 08:32:00,480
Does he infinitely spawn?

6436
08:32:00,480 --> 08:32:02,480
Oh, you need to whack him again.

6437
08:32:02,480 --> 08:32:04,480
If they have the little ghost thingy,

6438
08:32:04,480 --> 08:32:06,480
you need to be whack.

6439
08:32:06,480 --> 08:32:08,480
She's allergic to rest.

6440
08:32:08,480 --> 08:32:10,480
This sounds terrible, but at this moment in time,

6441
08:32:10,480 --> 08:32:12,480
I can't sleep properly.

6442
08:32:12,480 --> 08:32:16,480
So my logic is that I might as well...

6443
08:32:16,480 --> 08:32:20,480
Because if I go lie down and I can't sleep,

6444
08:32:20,480 --> 08:32:22,480
I will be so annoyed that I went offline

6445
08:32:22,480 --> 08:32:25,480
when we could have played some more together.

6446
08:32:25,480 --> 08:32:27,480
So instead of doing that, I'm like,

6447
08:32:27,480 --> 08:32:30,480
well, I'm probably guaranteed to pass out instantly.

6448
08:32:30,480 --> 08:32:32,480
Oh shit, I missed.

6449
08:32:32,480 --> 08:32:34,480
Because if I pass out instantly,

6450
08:32:34,480 --> 08:32:37,480
then I'll get more than enough sleep.

6451
08:32:37,480 --> 08:32:38,480
Does that make sense?

6452
08:32:38,480 --> 08:32:40,480
That makes terrible sense.

6453
08:32:40,480 --> 08:32:42,480
But it's kind of the truth.

6454
08:32:43,480 --> 08:32:45,480
Have you tried ASMR?

6455
08:32:45,480 --> 08:32:48,480
I watch video games to sleep too,

6456
08:32:48,480 --> 08:32:51,480
like people playing video games that have an interest in.

6457
08:32:51,480 --> 08:32:54,480
I currently watch Binding of Isaac gameplay.

6458
08:32:54,480 --> 08:32:56,480
I'm not very good at it,

6459
08:32:56,480 --> 08:32:58,480
before anyone's like,

6460
08:32:58,480 --> 08:33:01,480
oh my god, AMLG Pro, no, I'm just...

6461
08:33:01,480 --> 08:33:03,480
I just watch, like,

6462
08:33:03,480 --> 08:33:05,480
because I've been watching Boutro to sleep,

6463
08:33:05,480 --> 08:33:07,480
I've been watching Binding of Isaac to sleep.

6464
08:33:07,480 --> 08:33:09,480
I've been watching Civ 6.

6465
08:33:09,480 --> 08:33:11,480
I can't understand it.

6466
08:33:11,480 --> 08:33:13,480
But I've been watching people play it,

6467
08:33:13,480 --> 08:33:15,480
and I think it's probably one of those games

6468
08:33:15,480 --> 08:33:19,480
that I'll play when I retire, basically.

6469
08:33:19,480 --> 08:33:23,480
Holy shit, he's putting magma everywhere.

6470
08:33:26,480 --> 08:33:28,480
Is he supposed to do that?

6471
08:33:28,480 --> 08:33:30,480
Ow, like, it burns.

6472
08:33:30,480 --> 08:33:32,480
It burns, everything burns.

6473
08:33:32,480 --> 08:33:34,480
Oh my god, this whole cave is burning.

6474
08:33:35,480 --> 08:33:38,480
Like, I don't think I could play Civ 6

6475
08:33:38,480 --> 08:33:40,480
to make it fun without having, like,

6476
08:33:40,480 --> 08:33:42,480
actual game time in it.

6477
08:33:42,480 --> 08:33:45,480
There's just some games that aren't good for strumming.

6478
08:33:47,480 --> 08:33:50,480
And I would say

6479
08:33:50,480 --> 08:33:52,480
Civ 6, when you're not

6480
08:33:52,480 --> 08:33:54,480
experienced with it at all,

6481
08:33:54,480 --> 08:33:56,480
is one of the...wait, am I being done?

6482
08:33:57,480 --> 08:33:59,480
He's still up, wait, what's his health?

6483
08:33:59,480 --> 08:34:00,480
Oh no, he's going down.

6484
08:34:00,480 --> 08:34:02,480
Wait, hold on, I need to restore my stamina.

6485
08:34:03,480 --> 08:34:05,480
I need my stamina.

6486
08:34:06,480 --> 08:34:08,480
Oh my god, he's stuck.

6487
08:34:08,480 --> 08:34:10,480
That's a cool design.

6488
08:34:10,480 --> 08:34:12,480
Honestly, I'm so down for a dragon.

6489
08:34:12,480 --> 08:34:14,480
Actually, I need to mention that

6490
08:34:14,480 --> 08:34:16,480
to the concept artist.

6491
08:34:16,480 --> 08:34:18,480
I'm really interested in developing

6492
08:34:18,480 --> 08:34:20,480
a lollipop dragon

6493
08:34:20,480 --> 08:34:23,480
with a very unique color palette.

6494
08:34:23,480 --> 08:34:26,480
Ancient dragon smithing stone, yeah.

6495
08:34:27,480 --> 08:34:29,480
I wish that worked for me,

6496
08:34:29,480 --> 08:34:31,480
even if I'm disgustingly ghosted.

6497
08:34:31,480 --> 08:34:32,480
I can still be up.

6498
08:34:32,480 --> 08:34:34,480
No, like, my brain will be like,

6499
08:34:34,480 --> 08:34:36,480
you've had enough.

6500
08:34:36,480 --> 08:34:38,480
And I think I'm going to hit it

6501
08:34:38,480 --> 08:34:40,480
if I keep going,

6502
08:34:40,480 --> 08:34:41,480
which is what I want.

6503
08:34:41,480 --> 08:34:44,480
So this is, like, tactfully streaming.

6504
08:34:44,480 --> 08:34:46,480
Like, I don't want streamers like,

6505
08:34:46,480 --> 08:34:47,480
oh, you're going to rest.

6506
08:34:47,480 --> 08:34:49,480
I'm so tired, you're going to rest.

6507
08:34:49,480 --> 08:34:53,480
Me, like, now let's push the fucking limit.

6508
08:34:53,480 --> 08:34:54,480
Like, let's push one.

6509
08:34:54,480 --> 08:34:56,480
Okay, we're going down this time.

6510
08:34:57,480 --> 08:34:59,480
Fucking hell, man.

6511
08:35:03,480 --> 08:35:06,480
But if I caught any of the vealer girls doing this,

6512
08:35:06,480 --> 08:35:08,480
no, they're getting spanked and put into bed.

6513
08:35:08,480 --> 08:35:10,480
I'm coming to their hooses.

6514
08:35:11,480 --> 08:35:12,480
I'm going to their hooses.

6515
08:35:12,480 --> 08:35:14,480
I think they can get away with this.

6516
08:35:14,480 --> 08:35:16,480
Only I'm allowed to do this.

6517
08:35:18,480 --> 08:35:19,480
Ooh, there's a bull.

6518
08:35:19,480 --> 08:35:20,480
Oh, look!

6519
08:35:20,480 --> 08:35:22,480
It's the sip bull that I kicked.

6520
08:35:22,480 --> 08:35:23,480
Oh!

6521
08:35:26,480 --> 08:35:28,480
Was I supposed to do that?

6522
08:35:28,480 --> 08:35:31,480
Oh, my God.

6523
08:35:34,480 --> 08:35:36,480
I didn't know we were supposed to do that.

6524
08:35:36,480 --> 08:35:38,480
I was so happy about the sip bull

6525
08:35:38,480 --> 08:35:42,480
that I was going to cook for everyone on the farm.

6526
08:35:42,480 --> 08:35:46,480
Oh, my God, I had a damn heart attack.

6527
08:35:46,480 --> 08:35:48,480
Right, Ian's ready.

6528
08:35:48,480 --> 08:35:49,480
Are you steady?

6529
08:35:49,480 --> 08:35:50,480
I have no idea what's behind.

6530
08:35:50,480 --> 08:35:52,480
But let's do it!

6531
08:35:52,480 --> 08:35:54,480
Oh, shit, I don't have my crossbow out.

6532
08:35:54,480 --> 08:35:55,480
Oh, shit.

6533
08:35:55,480 --> 08:35:56,480
Okay, melee.

6534
08:35:56,480 --> 08:35:57,480
Whoa, wait.

6535
08:35:57,480 --> 08:35:58,480
You're...

6536
08:36:00,480 --> 08:36:03,480
Okay, it looks like bleed damage, athletic build.

6537
08:36:03,480 --> 08:36:05,480
Super skinny Malinky.

6538
08:36:06,480 --> 08:36:08,480
Terrible poise.

6539
08:36:08,480 --> 08:36:10,480
That's what we like to see.

6540
08:36:10,480 --> 08:36:11,480
Unable to resist.

6541
08:36:11,480 --> 08:36:13,480
Hold on, I need to recharge my stamina.

6542
08:36:17,480 --> 08:36:18,480
Oh, my God.

6543
08:36:18,480 --> 08:36:20,480
This is my kind of fight.

6544
08:36:21,480 --> 08:36:22,480
Yeah!

6545
08:36:22,480 --> 08:36:23,480
That's right.

6546
08:36:23,480 --> 08:36:25,480
Get a staggered, get a staggered, get a staggered.

6547
08:36:25,480 --> 08:36:27,480
Oh, that's my kind of fight.

6548
08:36:27,480 --> 08:36:28,480
I love it here.

6549
08:36:28,480 --> 08:36:29,480
Hello.

6550
08:36:29,480 --> 08:36:30,480
Hello.

6551
08:36:30,480 --> 08:36:32,480
Dragon Hunter's great katana.

6552
08:36:32,480 --> 08:36:33,480
Yeah, definitely.

6553
08:36:33,480 --> 08:36:35,480
Me look like a samurai build type thing to that.

6554
08:36:35,480 --> 08:36:37,480
Do you guys always have to go...

6555
08:36:37,480 --> 08:36:39,480
I said, I'm installing a mod right now.

6556
08:36:39,480 --> 08:36:42,480
That means you guys get to, like, hang around after you do a boss fight with me.

6557
08:36:42,480 --> 08:36:45,480
Strony, are you telling me I need to spank you

6558
08:36:45,480 --> 08:36:47,480
when I need to look after you?

6559
08:36:47,480 --> 08:36:49,480
It's the only way I'll listen.

6560
08:36:49,480 --> 08:36:51,480
If he looks after you, Strony, then we sling.

6561
08:36:51,480 --> 08:36:53,480
And we spank me as well.

6562
08:36:54,480 --> 08:36:56,480
Three stack on it is easy.

6563
08:36:56,480 --> 08:36:58,480
Plop, plop, plop, get staggered, get staggered, get staggered.

6564
08:36:58,480 --> 08:37:00,480
There's a head coming.

6565
08:37:00,480 --> 08:37:02,480
Did I unlock a...

6566
08:37:02,480 --> 08:37:04,480
Did I unlock anything?

6567
08:37:04,480 --> 08:37:05,480
No.

6568
08:37:05,480 --> 08:37:06,480
Yeah.

6569
08:37:08,480 --> 08:37:11,480
I swear if an enemy pops out, it's one of these things.

6570
08:37:11,480 --> 08:37:13,480
Oh, thank goodness.

6571
08:37:13,480 --> 08:37:15,480
Oh, thank you.

6572
08:37:16,480 --> 08:37:17,480
Touch me.

6573
08:37:19,480 --> 08:37:22,480
Can I summon the Duman?

6574
08:37:24,480 --> 08:37:26,480
It's not a punishment if you enjoy it.

6575
08:37:26,480 --> 08:37:30,480
I don't think I can summon you guys at Dragon's Fit Termina.

6576
08:37:30,480 --> 08:37:32,480
Go outside, okay.

6577
08:37:34,480 --> 08:37:37,480
Streamer gets told to go outside and touch grass.

6578
08:37:37,480 --> 08:37:38,480
Yeah.

6579
08:37:46,480 --> 08:37:49,480
Analysing foot of the jagged peak.

6580
08:37:53,480 --> 08:37:55,480
Hmm, I wonder if there's a dragon fight ahead.

6581
08:37:55,480 --> 08:37:57,480
I don't know, I just have some weird inclination.

6582
08:37:57,480 --> 08:37:59,480
There might be a dragon fight ahead.

6583
08:37:59,480 --> 08:38:01,480
No idea why.

6584
08:38:01,480 --> 08:38:03,480
I think there might be a dragon fight ahead.

6585
08:38:07,480 --> 08:38:09,480
Oh, there's that flame guy.

6586
08:38:11,480 --> 08:38:13,480
Go to the cave's entrance, link back.

6587
08:38:16,480 --> 08:38:18,480
Can you guys put it down here?

6588
08:38:28,480 --> 08:38:31,480
Okay, if you guys go to Dragon's Fit Termina,

6589
08:38:31,480 --> 08:38:33,480
you can really come outside.

6590
08:38:33,480 --> 08:38:36,480
Why is there only 50 areas?

6591
08:38:37,480 --> 08:38:40,480
Map required ahead, therefore, water side.

6592
08:38:45,480 --> 08:38:47,480
Sorry, I didn't realize it wasn't active.

6593
08:38:47,480 --> 08:38:48,480
I thought it was the map.

6594
08:38:48,480 --> 08:38:49,480
Oh, there you are.

6595
08:38:49,480 --> 08:38:50,480
Okay.

6596
08:38:50,480 --> 08:38:52,480
There wasn't any pineapple.

6597
08:38:52,480 --> 08:38:54,480
We knew an ally.

6598
08:38:54,480 --> 08:38:57,480
Oh, my brain's getting marshed.

6599
08:38:57,480 --> 08:39:00,480
I can't remember who was who

6600
08:39:00,480 --> 08:39:02,480
and who wasn't who.

6601
08:39:02,480 --> 08:39:04,480
I'm trying my best.

6602
08:39:04,480 --> 08:39:06,480
I'm so sorry.

6603
08:39:06,480 --> 08:39:09,480
I can't remember anymore, my brain.

6604
08:39:09,480 --> 08:39:11,480
I'm trying, I'm trying.

6605
08:39:11,480 --> 08:39:13,480
I promise I'm trying.

6606
08:39:16,480 --> 08:39:19,480
Can't grab the map in this area, so it's blind.

6607
08:39:19,480 --> 08:39:21,480
Or just run past the dragon to the right.

6608
08:39:21,480 --> 08:39:22,480
Not, I need to say.

6609
08:39:22,480 --> 08:39:23,480
Okay.

6610
08:39:24,480 --> 08:39:26,480
I'm well very...

6611
08:39:26,480 --> 08:39:28,480
Oh, sorry.

6612
08:39:29,480 --> 08:39:31,480
There's so many allegations.

6613
08:39:31,480 --> 08:39:32,480
Might be found in the...

6614
08:39:32,480 --> 08:39:34,480
Oh, no, who doesn't come in?

6615
08:39:34,480 --> 08:39:36,480
Is it DC?

6616
08:39:36,480 --> 08:39:39,480
Unable to summon 4 partners.

6617
08:39:39,480 --> 08:39:40,480
Someone's got...

6618
08:39:40,480 --> 08:39:43,480
Someone's internet does not like me.

6619
08:39:51,480 --> 08:39:53,480
I like how you have a staff to point the way.

6620
08:39:53,480 --> 08:39:55,480
It's pretty good.

6621
08:39:56,480 --> 08:39:59,480
Remember that thing that Wiefling blocked me from falling?

6622
08:39:59,480 --> 08:40:00,480
Oh, no, sorry.

6623
08:40:00,480 --> 08:40:03,480
All three Wieflings blocked me from falling to my death

6624
08:40:03,480 --> 08:40:05,480
because you all knew fine well.

6625
08:40:05,480 --> 08:40:08,480
I would have kept walking because I was blabbing away talking on stream.

6626
08:40:08,480 --> 08:40:09,480
That was very cute.

6627
08:40:09,480 --> 08:40:11,480
I like that moment.

6628
08:40:11,480 --> 08:40:12,480
I'd be...

6629
08:40:12,480 --> 08:40:16,480
Maybe I should get a commemorative doodle for that as well.

6630
08:40:16,480 --> 08:40:20,480
I want a commemorative doodle of you guys carrying me through Elden Ring.

6631
08:40:20,480 --> 08:40:23,480
And then maybe I'll just get like a doodle meme.

6632
08:40:23,480 --> 08:40:25,480
One of those colored doodles in memes.

6633
08:40:25,480 --> 08:40:27,480
And it's like, stop, don't go.

6634
08:40:27,480 --> 08:40:33,480
And then like I'm saying something like some capitals ran as I usually do.

6635
08:40:33,480 --> 08:40:38,480
And like you guys are like blocking me from walking forward.

6636
08:40:38,480 --> 08:40:41,480
That would be funny.

6637
08:40:42,480 --> 08:40:44,480
Mm-hmm.

6638
08:40:51,480 --> 08:40:52,480
Wait.

6639
08:40:52,480 --> 08:40:54,480
Oh, no, the dragon is alive.

6640
08:40:54,480 --> 08:40:55,480
Hold on.

6641
08:40:55,480 --> 08:40:56,480
What do we do?

6642
08:40:56,480 --> 08:40:59,480
Are we just avoiding by going right?

6643
08:40:59,480 --> 08:41:01,480
I think we're avoiding by going right side.

6644
08:41:01,480 --> 08:41:03,480
I can do that.

6645
08:41:04,480 --> 08:41:10,480
That's a very sleepy dragon.

6646
08:41:10,480 --> 08:41:12,480
Very, very sleepy dragon.

6647
08:41:12,480 --> 08:41:13,480
Okay.

6648
08:41:13,480 --> 08:41:15,480
If he's a slumber, he doesn't have to.

6649
08:41:15,480 --> 08:41:21,480
Three Reflings carrying Strony on a palanquin.

6650
08:41:21,480 --> 08:41:25,480
Oh Reflings, what's a palanquin?

6651
08:41:25,480 --> 08:41:28,480
Is it the Egypt chair?

6652
08:41:28,480 --> 08:41:29,480
Like you...

6653
08:41:29,480 --> 08:41:30,480
Whoa.

6654
08:41:31,480 --> 08:41:32,480
Yeah, damn.

6655
08:41:32,480 --> 08:41:34,480
What are they feeding you?

6656
08:41:34,480 --> 08:41:36,480
You guys still eat GMO food?

6657
08:41:36,480 --> 08:41:38,480
This is what's happening to your GMO...

6658
08:41:38,480 --> 08:41:43,480
Yes, it's also something called a litter.

6659
08:41:43,480 --> 08:41:45,480
I'll unsummon you.

6660
08:41:45,480 --> 08:41:46,480
Fuck that.

6661
08:41:46,480 --> 08:41:47,480
Isn't it your bedtime?

6662
08:41:47,480 --> 08:41:51,480
5 p.m. is my actual bedtime, but I'm trying to flip my sleep.

6663
08:41:51,480 --> 08:41:54,480
So I fall asleep right now.

6664
08:41:54,480 --> 08:41:58,480
5 p.m. is my actual bedtime, but I'm trying to flip my sleep.

6665
08:41:58,480 --> 08:42:02,480
So I fall asleep right after stream.

6666
08:42:02,480 --> 08:42:04,480
So I can wake up at 1.

6667
08:42:04,480 --> 08:42:07,480
So if I do fall asleep right now,

6668
08:42:07,480 --> 08:42:10,480
I'm gonna be like after the end of stream.

6669
08:42:10,480 --> 08:42:12,480
If I fall asleep instantly,

6670
08:42:12,480 --> 08:42:15,480
I will have done my sleep the way I want it to be.

6671
08:42:15,480 --> 08:42:17,480
What is banging and thrashing about?

6672
08:42:17,480 --> 08:42:18,480
I can hear it.

6673
08:42:18,480 --> 08:42:23,480
Who making all that damn noise?

6674
08:42:23,480 --> 08:42:25,480
Oh, I hope he's dead.

6675
08:42:25,480 --> 08:42:29,480
I don't want his furry body to be...

6676
08:42:29,480 --> 08:42:30,480
suffering.

6677
08:42:30,480 --> 08:42:32,480
Oh, that is a flame?

6678
08:42:32,480 --> 08:42:35,480
I can see him.

6679
08:42:35,480 --> 08:42:40,480
No, I think he definitely gone, the fur guy.

6680
08:42:40,480 --> 08:42:43,480
Oh, it's the dragon's heartbeat?

6681
08:42:43,480 --> 08:42:50,480
I see a stone dragon, but his heart still pulses?

6682
08:42:50,480 --> 08:42:52,480
The noise is ugly on a farm.

6683
08:42:52,480 --> 08:42:53,480
Are you getting your stuff?

6684
08:42:53,480 --> 08:42:58,480
Did I touch it?

6685
08:42:58,480 --> 08:43:00,480
Oh, examine.

6686
08:43:00,480 --> 08:43:04,480
Communion with bail.

6687
08:43:04,480 --> 08:43:10,480
Additional items required, okay.

6688
08:43:10,480 --> 08:43:13,480
Virtual dragon communication.

6689
08:43:13,480 --> 08:43:15,480
Offering a dragon heart, ghost breath.

6690
08:43:15,480 --> 08:43:19,480
Channels, dragons, just use a flame.

6691
08:43:19,480 --> 08:43:23,480
Right, so I don't need to do any of that.

6692
08:43:23,480 --> 08:43:25,480
Okay.

6693
08:43:25,480 --> 08:43:28,480
We claimed the dragon?

6694
08:43:28,480 --> 08:43:32,480
Like in the other one?

6695
08:43:32,480 --> 08:43:33,480
Wait, what?

6696
08:43:33,480 --> 08:43:35,480
Oh, there's someone here talk to.

6697
08:43:35,480 --> 08:43:37,480
Oh.

6698
08:43:37,480 --> 08:43:39,480
Eject yourself.

6699
08:43:39,480 --> 08:43:42,480
Feasting upon a dragon's essence.

6700
08:43:42,480 --> 08:43:43,480
Yeah.

6701
08:43:43,480 --> 08:43:45,480
On the throbbing heart of the oldest,

6702
08:43:45,480 --> 08:43:49,480
violent dragon of them all.

6703
08:43:49,480 --> 08:43:53,480
It would be the purest form of communion.

6704
08:43:53,480 --> 08:43:56,480
The fullest sating of your hunger

6705
08:43:56,480 --> 08:44:00,480
and your consummation as a dragon.

6706
08:44:00,480 --> 08:44:01,480
She wants to become part dragon?

6707
08:44:01,480 --> 08:44:02,480
Oh, she is?

6708
08:44:02,480 --> 08:44:07,480
Look at her hands on the devourer?

6709
08:44:07,480 --> 08:44:13,480
Eat?

6710
08:44:13,480 --> 08:44:15,480
Eat or no eat?

6711
08:44:15,480 --> 08:44:21,480
Eat wagon or no eat wagon?

6712
08:44:21,480 --> 08:44:25,480
Hmm.

6713
08:44:25,480 --> 08:44:26,480
Oh, it's a sin.

6714
08:44:26,480 --> 08:44:27,480
Do not partake.

6715
08:44:27,480 --> 08:44:30,480
You have yet to be a true one.

6716
08:44:30,480 --> 08:44:32,480
I am patient.

6717
08:44:32,480 --> 08:44:35,480
There will come a day when hunger knocks.

6718
08:44:35,480 --> 08:44:36,480
I don't know, man.

6719
08:44:36,480 --> 08:44:38,480
You don't look like this.

6720
08:44:38,480 --> 08:44:39,480
You don't look like this.

6721
08:44:39,480 --> 08:44:40,480
You look like this.

6722
08:44:40,480 --> 08:44:46,480
Okay, let's go.

6723
08:44:46,480 --> 08:44:50,480
I wonder if it gives you like a special thing you can do.

6724
08:44:50,480 --> 08:44:53,480
Yeah, the airtree don't like when you start messing with dragons stuff.

6725
08:44:53,480 --> 08:44:56,480
Okay.

6726
08:44:56,480 --> 08:44:59,480
The sound of standing on the scales

6727
08:44:59,480 --> 08:45:07,480
almost gravel-like.

6728
08:45:07,480 --> 08:45:09,480
It sounds like cabbage, honestly.

6729
08:45:09,480 --> 08:45:11,480
I'm wondering what foley sound they use for it.

6730
08:45:11,480 --> 08:45:18,480
It sounds like cabbage.

6731
08:45:18,480 --> 08:45:21,480
Okay.

6732
08:45:21,480 --> 08:45:24,480
Oh, is this the red flowers?

6733
08:45:24,480 --> 08:45:25,480
Oh, my God.

6734
08:45:25,480 --> 08:45:29,480
No, that's putting me to sleep because of the hue.

6735
08:45:29,480 --> 08:45:32,480
I need to get out of here.

6736
08:45:32,480 --> 08:45:33,480
Oh, no.

6737
08:45:33,480 --> 08:45:37,480
New area load.

6738
08:45:37,480 --> 08:45:39,480
New area load.

6739
08:45:39,480 --> 08:45:41,480
I'm afraid we fling.

6740
08:45:41,480 --> 08:45:43,480
It's the same.

6741
08:45:43,480 --> 08:45:46,480
Where are we on the map?

6742
08:45:46,480 --> 08:45:47,480
Yeah.

6743
08:45:47,480 --> 08:45:49,480
Damn, this map just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

6744
08:45:49,480 --> 08:45:50,480
Oh, we are on the red.

6745
08:45:50,480 --> 08:45:56,480
We're about to do a big U-turn to that blue thing, I thought.

6746
08:45:56,480 --> 08:45:59,480
Is that all the blue things?

6747
08:45:59,480 --> 08:46:01,480
Oh, no.

6748
08:46:01,480 --> 08:46:05,480
Shadow is hitting three.

6749
08:46:05,480 --> 08:46:15,480
I feel blessed to show the beauty of this human coconut tunnel.

6750
08:46:15,480 --> 08:46:16,480
Lord ahead.

6751
08:46:16,480 --> 08:46:21,480
Okay, I'm not going down there, then.

6752
08:46:21,480 --> 08:46:35,480
I'll go up and pray that there's something up here.

6753
08:46:35,480 --> 08:46:37,480
Bruh.

6754
08:46:37,480 --> 08:46:39,480
You've never been mean to me before.

6755
08:46:39,480 --> 08:46:41,480
Why are you being mean to me now?

6756
08:46:41,480 --> 08:46:44,480
The moment my refunds disappear, the game's like,

6757
08:46:44,480 --> 08:46:48,480
let me just go absolutely eat on you.

6758
08:46:48,480 --> 08:46:54,480
No, I'll go to the marina.

6759
08:46:54,480 --> 08:46:55,480
Not secure anymore.

6760
08:46:55,480 --> 08:46:56,480
No, I think I'll back.

6761
08:46:56,480 --> 08:46:58,480
Honestly, try to terrify me like that.

6762
08:46:58,480 --> 08:47:00,480
It's working.

6763
08:47:00,480 --> 08:47:03,480
I don't really want to get attacked by a marina because they have distance magic,

6764
08:47:03,480 --> 08:47:05,480
but I'm just going to go for it.

6765
08:47:05,480 --> 08:47:10,480
And then get past real quick.

6766
08:47:10,480 --> 08:47:11,480
I'm here.

6767
08:47:11,480 --> 08:47:13,480
I'm casting off a little spell.

6768
08:47:13,480 --> 08:47:18,480
Sorry, can't reach me.

6769
08:47:18,480 --> 08:47:20,480
Okay, I'm happy with this.

6770
08:47:20,480 --> 08:47:21,480
I'll take this.

6771
08:47:21,480 --> 08:47:22,480
I don't know what it is.

6772
08:47:22,480 --> 08:47:23,480
What it does.

6773
08:47:23,480 --> 08:47:25,480
I don't know where it is.

6774
08:47:25,480 --> 08:47:27,480
I'll take it.

6775
08:47:27,480 --> 08:47:29,480
Give me a...

6776
08:47:29,480 --> 08:47:33,480
Okay, this is called...

6777
08:47:33,480 --> 08:47:35,480
Rest well, those who need to sleep.

6778
08:47:35,480 --> 08:47:37,480
Yes, please don't feel bad about needing to sleep.

6779
08:47:37,480 --> 08:47:39,480
I feel you.

6780
08:47:39,480 --> 08:47:41,480
I feel you.

6781
08:47:41,480 --> 08:47:42,480
This is called...

6782
08:47:42,480 --> 08:47:47,480
Shadows Hidden Grieve.

6783
08:47:47,480 --> 08:47:50,480
I think I can come here.

6784
08:47:50,480 --> 08:47:52,480
I'm pretty sure it just has cute...

6785
08:47:52,480 --> 08:47:53,480
No, my cute worm does.

6786
08:47:53,480 --> 08:47:55,480
Literally, the worms are so nice.

6787
08:47:55,480 --> 08:47:57,480
Oh my God, worm and gentoo?

6788
08:47:57,480 --> 08:47:59,480
Question mark?

6789
08:47:59,480 --> 08:48:07,480
Worm beach ever?

6790
08:48:07,480 --> 08:48:10,480
Wait, why are you smacking me?

6791
08:48:11,480 --> 08:48:14,480
I'm sure I heard it.

6792
08:48:14,480 --> 08:48:16,480
I went to do...

6793
08:48:16,480 --> 08:48:23,480
Would you still love a beach over if she was a worm?

6794
08:48:23,480 --> 08:48:24,480
Possibly.

6795
08:48:24,480 --> 08:48:32,480
I wonder where the reviews are so far so good.

6796
08:48:32,480 --> 08:48:35,480
Wait, is that the bottom of the map?

6797
08:48:35,480 --> 08:48:42,480
Or is that you can go even further down?

6798
08:48:42,480 --> 08:48:47,480
I don't see any enemies though.

6799
08:48:47,480 --> 08:48:55,480
If I spot an enemy, it means you can go down there.

6800
08:48:55,480 --> 08:48:57,480
You can go even further down?

6801
08:48:57,480 --> 08:49:02,480
Oh my God.

6802
08:49:02,480 --> 08:49:04,480
Oh, there's a statue...

6803
08:49:04,480 --> 08:49:06,480
Oh no, there's a church there.

6804
08:49:06,480 --> 08:49:09,480
I have terrible news, Reeflands.

6805
08:49:09,480 --> 08:49:14,480
I don't think...

6806
08:49:14,480 --> 08:49:19,480
I don't think you guys can come in.

6807
08:49:19,480 --> 08:49:26,480
You get there's that ravine there that I just completely avoided down the street.

6808
08:49:26,480 --> 08:49:28,480
It's a shite of heads.

6809
08:49:28,480 --> 08:49:30,480
Strong, poor heads.

6810
08:49:30,480 --> 08:49:33,480
Why can't I get Reeflands in them?

6811
08:49:33,480 --> 08:49:37,480
If I've not done it.

6812
08:49:37,480 --> 08:49:38,480
Oh, for goodness sake.

6813
08:49:38,480 --> 08:49:40,480
It's just that stupid thing where it's like, cancel.

6814
08:49:40,480 --> 08:49:41,480
Okay, that makes a lot more sense.

6815
08:49:41,480 --> 08:49:44,480
I was like, oh, you've not been in for a bit.

6816
08:49:44,480 --> 08:49:47,480
I was like, oh no, is everyone like unable to...

6817
08:49:47,480 --> 08:49:48,480
to get in?

6818
08:49:48,480 --> 08:49:51,480
But it says there's a nullify effect thing.

6819
08:49:51,480 --> 08:49:56,480
I didn't find out what you're using.

6820
08:49:56,480 --> 08:49:58,480
Thank you, gay Disney.

6821
08:49:58,480 --> 08:50:01,480
Did you not...?

6822
08:50:01,480 --> 08:50:03,480
Again, I'm so sorry.

6823
08:50:03,480 --> 08:50:04,480
I'm forgetting.

6824
08:50:04,480 --> 08:50:08,480
I'm not even able to write English anymore, seriously.

6825
08:50:08,480 --> 08:50:10,480
This list is getting out of hand.

6826
08:50:10,480 --> 08:50:11,480
Oh no, wait.

6827
08:50:11,480 --> 08:50:13,480
I did it wrong.

6828
08:50:13,480 --> 08:50:15,480
Oh no, did someone time out already?

6829
08:50:15,480 --> 08:50:18,480
How did you time out that fast?

6830
08:50:18,480 --> 08:50:20,480
Okay, we've got evil.

6831
08:50:20,480 --> 08:50:22,480
No, whoa, everyone's timing out.

6832
08:50:22,480 --> 08:50:24,480
What's going on here?

6833
08:50:24,480 --> 08:50:25,480
Can anyone...?

6834
08:50:25,480 --> 08:50:30,480
Okay, we've got one in.

6835
08:50:30,480 --> 08:50:37,480
It's like timing the fuck out.

6836
08:50:37,480 --> 08:50:40,480
I haven't done this yet, Montoya.

6837
08:50:40,480 --> 08:50:43,480
For evil reason.

6838
08:50:43,480 --> 08:50:49,480
I think it's just the neck.

6839
08:50:49,480 --> 08:50:52,480
I don't know what kind of fate we got ahead of us.

6840
08:50:52,480 --> 08:51:02,480
So we're going to do it.

6841
08:51:02,480 --> 08:51:05,480
Got hit by a connection sign or something.

6842
08:51:05,480 --> 08:51:06,480
Oh, there we go.

6843
08:51:06,480 --> 08:51:08,480
You both come in the same thing.

6844
08:51:08,480 --> 08:51:10,480
Are we ready?

6845
08:51:10,480 --> 08:51:14,480
Are we ready?

6846
08:51:14,480 --> 08:51:20,480
Wait, are you telling us to go that way?

6847
08:51:20,480 --> 08:51:21,480
I realize we're going this way.

6848
08:51:21,480 --> 08:51:22,480
My bad.

6849
08:51:22,480 --> 08:51:23,480
I thought we were going to go where?

6850
08:51:23,480 --> 08:51:30,480
Where's the other one?

6851
08:51:30,480 --> 08:51:44,480
Where is the mariner guy?

6852
08:51:44,480 --> 08:52:01,480
Oh, no, I have to fucking respawn you.

6853
08:52:01,480 --> 08:52:03,480
Oh, yeah, couldn't, right?

6854
08:52:03,480 --> 08:52:07,480
We just got together.

6855
08:52:07,480 --> 08:52:11,480
Oh, Reeflings, I ask you kindly please leave so we can move to the next bit.

6856
08:52:11,480 --> 08:52:12,480
Hold on.

6857
08:52:12,480 --> 08:52:17,480
I'm going to readjust my cosy cover.

6858
08:52:17,480 --> 08:52:19,480
I'm getting ready to sleep.

6859
08:52:19,480 --> 08:52:23,480
We're doing a sleep stream, you guys, so listen to me for it.

6860
08:52:23,480 --> 08:52:26,480
I'm literally just people cosy and moat now.

6861
08:52:26,480 --> 08:52:28,480
It's over my head and everything.

6862
08:52:28,480 --> 08:52:33,480
Oh, I'm getting nice and calm.

6863
08:52:33,480 --> 08:52:38,480
Mommy's yawn.

6864
08:52:38,480 --> 08:52:45,480
I need to put it over me so I'm all nice and cool.

6865
08:52:45,480 --> 08:52:54,480
You need to charge my controller.

6866
08:52:54,480 --> 08:52:58,480
Can you guys come down here and then I summon you here?

6867
08:52:58,480 --> 08:52:59,480
Can we be that cheeky?

6868
08:52:59,480 --> 08:53:03,480
Can we be that deviant?

6869
08:53:03,480 --> 08:53:19,480
Okay, I'll see you at the bottom.

6870
08:53:19,480 --> 08:53:22,480
She says she doesn't see a summoning site.

6871
08:53:22,480 --> 08:53:25,480
Is this a boss site?

6872
08:53:25,480 --> 08:53:27,480
There's a grass, okay.

6873
08:53:27,480 --> 08:53:29,480
Are you disabled again?

6874
08:53:29,480 --> 08:53:42,480
Ah, fuck, let's see.

6875
08:53:42,480 --> 08:53:50,480
Don't you need to be on top to get the spoon?

6876
08:53:50,480 --> 08:53:51,480
I'm like trying to look.

6877
08:53:51,480 --> 08:53:56,480
I can see an enemy at the gravestone.

6878
08:53:56,480 --> 08:53:59,480
Where did I go? Up there?

6879
08:53:59,480 --> 08:54:02,480
Oh, if I go there to head, I'll knock them out.

6880
08:54:02,480 --> 08:54:13,480
I assume there's going to be a safe community there.

6881
08:54:13,480 --> 08:54:23,480
Oh, Torrent, how you keep me so safe?

6882
08:54:23,480 --> 08:54:28,480
That's too little bit of architecture.

6883
08:54:28,480 --> 08:54:30,480
Oh, did I pass it?

6884
08:54:30,480 --> 08:54:32,480
I'll tell you what, we'll go to the next one.

6885
08:54:32,480 --> 08:54:35,480
I think there must be something over here because the map's over here.

6886
08:54:35,480 --> 08:54:39,480
And the worms are friendly again.

6887
08:54:39,480 --> 08:54:40,480
Yeah, that's right.

6888
08:54:40,480 --> 08:54:42,480
You better be friendly again.

6889
08:54:42,480 --> 08:54:43,480
You stinky stinkerkin.

6890
08:54:43,480 --> 08:54:45,480
I like how their face is red.

6891
08:54:45,480 --> 08:54:52,480
Just show that they're not friendly.

6892
08:54:52,480 --> 08:54:55,480
Okay, let's see what we're looking at.

6893
08:54:55,480 --> 08:54:58,480
Okay, okay, so we are heading to the dead end.

6894
08:54:58,480 --> 08:55:02,480
So I assume that means like, oh, there's going to be a boss.

6895
08:55:02,480 --> 08:55:05,480
Let's see if we can get a save.

6896
08:55:05,480 --> 08:55:09,480
I do want a save site at this point.

6897
08:55:09,480 --> 08:55:11,480
Okay, at least there's one right there.

6898
08:55:11,480 --> 08:55:15,480
And then there's some angry worms over there.

6899
08:55:15,480 --> 08:55:19,480
Okay, let's go to this save site.

6900
08:55:19,480 --> 08:55:24,480
I can see this crab.

6901
08:55:24,480 --> 08:55:27,480
I need to get the map so I can continue to build.

6902
08:55:27,480 --> 08:55:31,480
Wow, the game doesn't let you progress.

6903
08:55:31,480 --> 08:55:41,480
Are these nectar blood virgins?

6904
08:55:41,480 --> 08:55:46,480
Okay.

6905
08:55:46,480 --> 08:55:47,480
How do I get to level up?

6906
08:55:47,480 --> 08:55:48,480
I actually have quite a lot.

6907
08:55:48,480 --> 08:55:51,480
I've got a new lesson.

6908
08:55:51,480 --> 08:55:53,480
Right, and then level up.

6909
08:55:53,480 --> 08:55:54,480
Okay, I do.

6910
08:55:54,480 --> 08:55:56,480
There's not too many of them.

6911
08:55:56,480 --> 08:55:59,480
The first six HP is rough.

6912
08:55:59,480 --> 08:56:03,480
Does someone say...

6913
08:56:03,480 --> 08:56:09,480
Is it arcane?

6914
08:56:09,480 --> 08:56:12,480
Is it intelligence to spray my crossbow?

6915
08:56:12,480 --> 08:56:13,480
I can't remember.

6916
08:56:14,480 --> 08:56:19,480
Or is it faith to spray the crossbow?

6917
08:56:19,480 --> 08:56:20,480
I don't know.

6918
08:56:20,480 --> 08:56:24,480
I mean, maybe just endurance.

6919
08:56:24,480 --> 08:56:26,480
Okay, I'll go back to Bale.

6920
08:56:26,480 --> 08:56:30,480
I didn't know about that drop down from up top.

6921
08:56:30,480 --> 08:56:32,480
No, no, no.

6922
08:56:32,480 --> 08:56:34,480
Arcane?

6923
08:56:34,480 --> 08:56:35,480
Maybe not arcane.

6924
08:56:35,480 --> 08:56:37,480
Alright, I'll just do endurance.

6925
08:56:37,480 --> 08:56:39,480
Why not?

6926
08:56:39,480 --> 08:56:42,480
Oh, someone says intelligence.

6927
08:56:42,480 --> 08:56:44,480
Magic.

6928
08:56:44,480 --> 08:56:46,480
That's not magic, defense up.

6929
08:56:46,480 --> 08:56:47,480
That's main.

6930
08:56:47,480 --> 08:56:48,480
Main does...

6931
08:56:48,480 --> 08:56:51,480
Oh, main does just like the do-do-do-do-do-do.

6932
08:56:51,480 --> 08:56:54,480
Okay.

6933
08:56:54,480 --> 08:56:56,480
Does shove in endurance then?

6934
08:56:56,480 --> 08:56:59,480
Does it really matter at this point?

6935
08:56:59,480 --> 08:57:02,480
No, when I go my reasons to look after me.

6936
08:57:02,480 --> 08:57:03,480
Okay, sorry.

6937
08:57:03,480 --> 08:57:05,480
Someone says teleport.

6938
08:57:05,480 --> 08:57:07,480
Go to the grand altar.

6939
08:57:07,480 --> 08:57:10,480
Now that we have the map,

6940
08:57:10,480 --> 08:57:15,480
we can grand altar of dragon communication.

6941
08:57:15,480 --> 08:57:18,480
Oh, communion, sorry.

6942
08:57:18,480 --> 08:57:22,480
Main is mana, so it's good for everyone,

6943
08:57:22,480 --> 08:57:26,480
not just me, just when I do my little ultimate.

6944
08:57:26,480 --> 08:57:28,480
I have no idea where you guys are taking me,

6945
08:57:28,480 --> 08:57:32,480
but dragon altar.

6946
08:57:32,480 --> 08:57:37,480
Come, come, come.

6947
08:57:37,480 --> 08:57:40,480
I'm just gonna pretend that's a good sound

6948
08:57:40,480 --> 08:57:43,480
and not at all the most dangerous sound ever,

6949
08:57:43,480 --> 08:57:46,480
like something like stomping around that's so humongous.

6950
08:57:46,480 --> 08:57:50,480
It takes like 20 seconds to stomp its other foot.

6951
08:57:55,480 --> 08:57:57,480
Wah.

6952
08:58:03,480 --> 08:58:06,480
Wait, you disconnect?

6953
08:58:06,480 --> 08:58:08,480
Right there.

6954
08:58:08,480 --> 08:58:11,480
Put away, look, put away.

6955
08:58:11,480 --> 08:58:14,480
I've actually got quite a few new ones there.

6956
08:58:14,480 --> 08:58:15,480
Let's switch it out.

6957
08:58:15,480 --> 08:58:19,480
I want to do the new one.

6958
08:58:19,480 --> 08:58:21,480
Uh...

6959
08:58:21,480 --> 08:58:23,480
Mm-hmm.

6960
08:58:23,480 --> 08:58:28,480
Mm-hmm.

6961
08:58:28,480 --> 08:58:29,480
I want all mother.

6962
08:58:29,480 --> 08:58:32,480
What does all mother look like?

6963
08:58:32,480 --> 08:58:35,480
Oh, refling, oh, refling.

6964
08:58:35,480 --> 08:58:38,480
Please forgive me for being so bad.

6965
08:58:38,480 --> 08:58:40,480
Mm-hmm.

6966
08:58:40,480 --> 08:58:42,480
Okay, let's get enemy.

6967
08:58:42,480 --> 08:58:43,480
Shlumpling, were you in last?

6968
08:58:43,480 --> 08:58:46,480
I think Shlumpling, you came with us last time.

6969
08:58:46,480 --> 08:58:48,480
Okay, light the way.

6970
08:58:48,480 --> 08:58:51,480
Where the heck are we supposed to go?

6971
08:58:51,480 --> 08:58:54,480
But once...

6972
08:58:54,480 --> 08:58:55,480
I don't like that.

6973
08:58:55,480 --> 08:58:56,480
That sounds so ominous.

6974
08:58:56,480 --> 08:58:58,480
Wait, once the enemy refling comes in,

6975
08:58:58,480 --> 08:59:00,480
are we going up this way?

6976
08:59:00,480 --> 08:59:01,480
Okay.

6977
08:59:01,480 --> 08:59:03,480
Enemy refling's spawning in.

6978
08:59:06,480 --> 08:59:07,480
Oh, yes.

6979
08:59:07,480 --> 08:59:09,480
No way.

6980
08:59:09,480 --> 08:59:11,480
Let's go.

6981
08:59:11,480 --> 08:59:17,480
Right, follow the glowing refling in the distance.

6982
08:59:17,480 --> 08:59:19,480
Follow him.

6983
08:59:19,480 --> 08:59:21,480
Follow him.

6984
08:59:21,480 --> 08:59:26,480
For he's gonna lead us to success.

6985
08:59:26,480 --> 08:59:30,480
And he's gonna lead us to the end of me.

6986
08:59:30,480 --> 08:59:31,480
Oh.

6987
08:59:31,480 --> 08:59:33,480
That was definitely not to the song.

6988
08:59:33,480 --> 08:59:36,480
I would stay with me.

6989
08:59:36,480 --> 08:59:41,480
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

6990
08:59:41,480 --> 08:59:43,480
Oh my god, I completely forgot

6991
08:59:43,480 --> 08:59:47,480
I was gonna try and do parody songs.

6992
08:59:47,480 --> 08:59:51,480
Holy shit, I've like completely forgotten them.

6993
08:59:51,480 --> 08:59:55,480
Oh, I don't have the fail on me.

6994
08:59:55,480 --> 08:59:58,980
I'll leak my files on the members' stream, how about that?

6995
09:00:00,780 --> 09:00:03,080
I wanted to do a parody song

6996
09:00:03,780 --> 09:00:07,880
because last time we played Elden Ring, I got killed by One Thrust

6997
09:00:08,280 --> 09:00:11,780
and I was like, One Thrust is all it took

6998
09:00:12,280 --> 09:00:15,480
but you know that song is One Kiss is all it takes

6999
09:00:16,280 --> 09:00:20,580
and I was trying to write a fucking dumbass parody song of it

7000
09:00:20,580 --> 09:00:23,080
and I was like, One Thrust is all it took

7001
09:00:23,580 --> 09:00:27,980
and all the possibilities, it was so bad

7002
09:00:27,980 --> 09:00:33,980
but I came up with another one for Azura and Sheeby

7003
09:00:35,480 --> 09:00:38,180
and I don't know if it's gonna come out shit or not

7004
09:00:38,180 --> 09:00:41,080
it's like the most simple basic parody

7005
09:00:43,280 --> 09:00:44,180
but do you know the song?

7006
09:00:44,180 --> 09:00:45,380
Do You Like Waffles?

7007
09:00:45,380 --> 09:00:46,580
Do You Like Waffles?

7008
09:00:46,580 --> 09:00:47,780
Do You Like Pancakes?

7009
09:00:47,780 --> 09:00:48,980
Do You Like Pancakes?

7010
09:00:48,980 --> 09:00:50,180
Do You Like French Toast?

7011
09:00:50,180 --> 09:00:51,280
Do You Like French Toast?

7012
09:00:52,280 --> 09:00:55,380
It's Gonna Wait To Get Enough Of Waffles

7013
09:00:55,880 --> 09:00:59,680
Basically, I wrote a parody of that and it's hags

7014
09:00:59,680 --> 09:01:01,380
and it's like, Do You Like Hag Lips?

7015
09:01:01,380 --> 09:01:02,580
Do You Like Hag Lips?

7016
09:01:02,580 --> 09:01:03,880
Do You Like Hag Hips?

7017
09:01:03,880 --> 09:01:05,780
Do You Like Hag Hips?

7018
09:01:05,780 --> 09:01:06,980
Do You Like Hag Hips?

7019
09:01:06,980 --> 09:01:08,280
Do You Like Hag Hips?

7020
09:01:08,280 --> 09:01:11,380
It's Can't Wait To Get Enough Of Hags

7021
09:01:11,380 --> 09:01:14,480
basically, but I've never recorded it or none

7022
09:01:16,380 --> 09:01:18,880
and I was gonna have it

7023
09:01:18,980 --> 09:01:23,980
that the music video has Azura and Sheeby fan art in it

7024
09:01:29,280 --> 09:01:32,280
Hag Love basically is the hook

7025
09:01:32,280 --> 09:01:33,380
so I need to make that

7026
09:01:33,380 --> 09:01:39,980
so I've been secretly pervading any Sheeby and Azura fan art

7027
09:01:39,980 --> 09:01:41,780
because I want to make that

7028
09:01:41,780 --> 09:01:44,380
and like I want like all the fan art to be shown off

7029
09:01:44,380 --> 09:01:45,680
and like oh special thank you

7030
09:01:45,680 --> 09:01:48,780
like we'll put like all the credit in the video and all that

7031
09:01:48,780 --> 09:01:50,580
I thought that would be really sweet

7032
09:01:53,080 --> 09:01:54,080
that would be so cool

7033
09:01:54,080 --> 09:01:56,080
Yeah, I had another one

7034
09:01:56,080 --> 09:02:00,280
and it was like a schizophrenia parody

7035
09:02:00,280 --> 09:02:02,780
that sounds really bad saying it out loud

7036
09:02:02,780 --> 09:02:04,480
but you know how like oh you have schizophrenia

7037
09:02:04,480 --> 09:02:06,080
because da da da da da

7038
09:02:06,080 --> 09:02:08,780
and then obviously I was like okay what's

7039
09:02:08,780 --> 09:02:11,680
oh I can't remember what the song parody is

7040
09:02:13,780 --> 09:02:15,380
oh it's that it girl

7041
09:02:15,380 --> 09:02:18,080
I T G I R L

7042
09:02:19,380 --> 09:02:20,880
it's an it girl parody

7043
09:02:20,880 --> 09:02:22,580
oh what does the song go like

7044
09:02:24,480 --> 09:02:30,880
A T I G I T G I R L

7045
09:02:33,680 --> 09:02:37,480
basically the song spells out a six letters

7046
09:02:37,480 --> 09:02:40,680
and then I was going to change it to get so like yeah

7047
09:02:40,680 --> 09:02:42,980
she's get so oh fuck I can't remember it though

7048
09:02:43,880 --> 09:02:45,380
what we're gonna have to manually claim

7049
09:02:45,380 --> 09:02:46,780
or do you guys have to get out

7050
09:02:47,780 --> 09:02:51,080
so I like I'm not kidding like I plan so much stuff in advance

7051
09:02:51,080 --> 09:02:54,580
I was gonna do like one parody song per month

7052
09:02:54,580 --> 09:02:56,080
just for the shits and giggles

7053
09:02:56,080 --> 09:02:59,080
and that hag one is probably the only one

7054
09:02:59,080 --> 09:03:02,480
that's actually even plausible for me to record at this point

7055
09:03:02,480 --> 09:03:05,680
the other what the fuck are you doing

7056
09:03:05,680 --> 09:03:08,580
what did you do to the shade

7057
09:03:08,580 --> 09:03:10,580
okay I need to go up

7058
09:03:10,580 --> 09:03:12,080
okay I understand I understand

7059
09:03:12,680 --> 09:03:16,580
and so I've got like one thrust is all it took for the reef

7060
09:03:16,580 --> 09:03:19,980
line I've got a hag love song

7061
09:03:21,580 --> 09:03:25,180
and and before someone like listen to this and steals it

7062
09:03:25,180 --> 09:03:27,180
and uploads it and be like no you can't prove it

7063
09:03:28,380 --> 09:03:29,980
you have to try again try again

7064
09:03:32,380 --> 09:03:35,380
fuck it up fuck it up

7065
09:03:36,580 --> 09:03:38,880
what a fucking view that was honestly

7066
09:03:38,880 --> 09:03:40,480
where are we at bridge

7067
09:03:41,480 --> 09:03:44,680
oh my god

7068
09:03:46,180 --> 09:03:49,680
um what an earth are we like walking towards

7069
09:03:50,780 --> 09:03:53,680
I can't remember any of the other parody songs I am

7070
09:03:55,280 --> 09:03:56,680
I am I made

7071
09:03:57,980 --> 09:04:00,380
I say made is basically someone else's

7072
09:04:00,380 --> 09:04:03,380
and like the melodies all there

7073
09:04:03,380 --> 09:04:05,180
I just swap out the words to whatever I want

7074
09:04:05,180 --> 09:04:06,680
but I guess that's what a parody is

7075
09:04:06,680 --> 09:04:07,680
look at me so hard

7076
09:04:07,680 --> 09:04:09,880
wait am I wait can I call you in here

7077
09:04:11,480 --> 09:04:13,980
why is there so much death here

7078
09:04:13,980 --> 09:04:15,480
huh

7079
09:04:15,480 --> 09:04:17,480
are people jumping off the map

7080
09:04:17,480 --> 09:04:19,480
nope well

7081
09:04:29,480 --> 09:04:31,480
for what

7082
09:04:32,480 --> 09:04:34,480
I

7083
09:04:38,480 --> 09:04:40,480
know I can't call anyone

7084
09:04:40,480 --> 09:04:42,480
made me to admit

7085
09:04:43,480 --> 09:04:45,480
you're on your own here

7086
09:04:48,480 --> 09:04:49,480
just stick to Torrent

7087
09:04:49,480 --> 09:04:51,480
and there should be a cavern up ahead

7088
09:04:53,480 --> 09:04:56,480
I hear a lot of noises I don't like

7089
09:04:56,480 --> 09:04:59,480
it's fucking dragons juking it out

7090
09:05:02,480 --> 09:05:05,480
you have to be shitting me

7091
09:05:06,480 --> 09:05:08,480
of course this dragon is juking it out

7092
09:05:08,480 --> 09:05:09,480
why wouldn't it be

7093
09:05:09,480 --> 09:05:11,480
where the fuck is this cavern

7094
09:05:11,480 --> 09:05:13,480
please be around the corner

7095
09:05:13,480 --> 09:05:15,480
so I don't see any of these dragons

7096
09:05:15,480 --> 09:05:17,480
of course it's not like it's easy

7097
09:05:21,480 --> 09:05:24,480
cavern cavern cavern de devern

7098
09:05:25,480 --> 09:05:27,480
I need a cavern

7099
09:05:28,480 --> 09:05:31,480
if they're fighting each other

7100
09:05:31,480 --> 09:05:33,480
don't you love it when the video game

7101
09:05:33,480 --> 09:05:35,480
has two enemies fighting each other

7102
09:05:35,480 --> 09:05:37,480
and then they both stop to fight

7103
09:05:37,480 --> 09:05:39,480
a random person on a horse that comes on by

7104
09:05:39,480 --> 09:05:41,480
honestly at adora

7105
09:05:41,480 --> 09:05:43,480
it's my favourite thing

7106
09:05:43,480 --> 09:05:45,480
I really wish more games

7107
09:05:45,480 --> 09:05:48,480
would constantly add that into the game

7108
09:05:48,480 --> 09:05:50,480
but how the fuck do I keep doing that

7109
09:05:54,480 --> 09:05:56,480

7114
09:06:11,480 --> 09:06:13,480
I thought it was a flower

7115
09:06:13,480 --> 09:06:14,480

7122
09:06:41,480 --> 09:06:43,480

7157
09:08:48,480 --> 09:08:51,480

7158
09:08:51,480 --> 09:08:55,480

7160
09:08:57,480 --> 09:08:59,480
can go that way

7161
09:08:59,480 --> 09:09:01,480
can go up the dead dragon way

7162
09:09:03,480 --> 09:09:05,480

09:09:06,480 --> 09:09:09,480

7167
09:09:21,480 --> 09:09:23,480

7168
09:09:23,480 --> 09:09:25,480

09:09:43,480 --> 09:09:45,480
a reefling

7176
09:09:45,480 --> 09:09:47,480
another player made it down there

7177
09:09:58,480 --> 09:10:00,480
be wary of storm but still no dark end

7178
09:10:02,480 --> 09:10:04,480

7179
09:10:04,480 --> 09:10:06,480

7183
09:10:20,480 --> 09:10:22,480
here

7184
09:10:38,480 --> 09:10:40,480

I'm going to go all the way back down the mountain

7187
09:10:47,480 --> 09:10:49,480
this is making me do a big math review so I'm

7188
09:10:51,480 --> 09:10:53,480
so crazy

7189
09:10:56,480 --> 09:10:58,480

09:12:03,480 --> 09:12:05,480
my heart rate shouldn't be too elevated

7208
09:12:05,480 --> 09:12:07,480

09:13:52,480 --> 09:13:54,480
a dragon

7241
09:13:54,480 --> 09:13:56,480

7242
09:14:06,480 --> 09:14:08,480

7243
09:14:13,480 --> 09:14:15,480

7244
09:14:15,480 --> 09:14:17,480
keep tracking on

7245
09:14:18,480 --> 09:14:20,480
he's so big

7246
09:14:23,480 --> 09:14:25,480

so long to do

7250
09:14:41,480 --> 09:14:43,480
oh his wee wings are gone

7251
09:14:43,480 --> 09:14:45,480
they're just little spears now

7252
09:14:46,480 --> 09:14:48,480
oh for buddy

7253
09:14:48,480 --> 09:14:50,480

7255
09:14:55,480 --> 09:14:57,480

7256
09:15:01,480 --> 09:15:03,480
oh wow

7257
09:15:04,480 --> 09:15:06,480
oh my god

7258
09:15:10,480 --> 09:15:12,480
I think we're out of our depth

7259
09:15:12,480 --> 09:15:14,480
Brooklyn

7260
09:15:14,480 --> 09:15:16,480
oh no I think we might be out of our

7261
09:15:16,480 --> 09:15:18,480
depth I'm like

7262
09:15:22,480 --> 09:15:24,480
oh my god he's only got one leg

7263
09:15:24,480 --> 09:15:26,480
he's like a wee amputee

7264
09:15:26,480 --> 09:15:28,480
of a dragon and every

7265
09:15:28,480 --> 09:15:30,480
wait does he only have one leg

7266
09:15:30,480 --> 09:15:32,480
or am I just making it up

7267
09:15:32,480 --> 09:15:34,480
he does

7268
09:15:34,480 --> 09:15:36,480
his wee per leg

7269
09:15:41,480 --> 09:15:43,480
oh my god

7270
09:15:54,480 --> 09:15:56,480
you know I'm actually doing pretty well

7271
09:15:56,480 --> 09:15:58,480
taking a whack from a dragon outside man

7272
09:15:58,480 --> 09:16:00,480
right his tail is in my face

7273
09:16:00,480 --> 09:16:02,480
of course I'm gonna hit it

7274
09:16:02,480 --> 09:16:04,480
not miss it

7275
09:16:04,480 --> 09:16:06,480
oh my god I'm way out of my depth here

7276
09:16:06,480 --> 09:16:08,480
Reefland

7277
09:16:12,480 --> 09:16:14,480
it's like impossible

7278
09:16:14,480 --> 09:16:16,480
to predict what he's gonna do

7279
09:16:23,480 --> 09:16:25,480
okay so he gets a bit

7280
09:16:25,480 --> 09:16:27,480
stuck when he does the fire

7281
09:16:30,480 --> 09:16:32,480
I can't even reach his little

7282
09:16:32,480 --> 09:16:34,480
meaty gammy leg

7283
09:16:34,480 --> 09:16:36,480
oh my god

7284
09:16:36,480 --> 09:16:38,480
literally disabling

7285
09:16:38,480 --> 09:16:40,480
disabling

7286
09:16:40,480 --> 09:16:42,480
bullying a disabled dragon

7287
09:16:42,480 --> 09:16:44,480
that feels so bad right now

7288
09:16:44,480 --> 09:16:46,480
I'm not sure how I feel about this

7289
09:16:46,480 --> 09:16:48,480
it seems awfully ableist to me

7290
09:16:51,480 --> 09:16:53,480
oh I'm getting cornered

7291
09:16:57,480 --> 09:16:59,480
well

7292
09:16:59,480 --> 09:17:01,480
I'm not sure we're gonna get past him

7293
09:17:01,480 --> 09:17:03,480
he's a dragon that tore

7294
09:17:03,480 --> 09:17:05,480
off

7295
09:17:08,480 --> 09:17:10,480
haven't seen gammy for a long time

7296
09:17:10,480 --> 09:17:12,480
he's grown this much

7297
09:17:12,480 --> 09:17:14,480
why is she so mad at ya

7298
09:17:14,480 --> 09:17:16,480
I have terrible news

7299
09:17:16,480 --> 09:17:18,480
I think we might have to do

7300
09:17:18,480 --> 09:17:20,480
something else cause

7301
09:17:21,480 --> 09:17:23,480
there's no way my pitiful

7302
09:17:23,480 --> 09:17:25,480
crossbow ball is gonna do a thing

7303
09:17:25,480 --> 09:17:27,480
maybe if I do blood damage

7304
09:17:30,480 --> 09:17:32,480
I'll just do bleed and then

7305
09:17:32,480 --> 09:17:34,480
if it's a dragon I guess I'll use

7306
09:17:34,480 --> 09:17:36,480
ace against the dragon

7307
09:17:36,480 --> 09:17:38,480
maybe that's how it works

7308
09:17:38,480 --> 09:17:40,480
that's how it totally works right

7309
09:17:47,480 --> 09:17:49,480
we can do it are you sure

7310
09:17:51,480 --> 09:17:53,480
I don't mean to be a doer

7311
09:17:53,480 --> 09:17:55,480
but that dragon

7312
09:17:55,480 --> 09:17:57,480
are you sure

7313
09:17:57,480 --> 09:17:59,480
I think it would be easier

7314
09:17:59,480 --> 09:18:01,480
to kill the bucket fire guy

7315
09:18:01,480 --> 09:18:03,480
honestly we got

7316
09:18:03,480 --> 09:18:05,480
bucket fire face to half

7317
09:18:06,480 --> 09:18:08,480
I mean I know that was just her first attempt

7318
09:18:08,480 --> 09:18:10,480
and I did pitiful but

7319
09:18:12,480 --> 09:18:14,480
I'm a bit insimidated ok

7320
09:18:14,480 --> 09:18:16,480
I'm a bit insimidated

7321
09:18:16,480 --> 09:18:18,480
we'll see what we can do

7322
09:18:18,480 --> 09:18:20,480
we'll see what we can do

7323
09:18:23,480 --> 09:18:25,480
does anyone have spiral shard

7324
09:18:26,480 --> 09:18:28,480
what does that do

7325
09:18:29,480 --> 09:18:31,480
what does spiral shard do

7326
09:18:31,480 --> 09:18:33,480
let's see

7327
09:18:33,480 --> 09:18:35,480
I can't go in

7328
09:18:35,480 --> 09:18:37,480
we don't know if we can

7329
09:18:37,480 --> 09:18:39,480
I

7330
09:18:52,480 --> 09:18:54,480
didn't even hit him

7331
09:18:54,480 --> 09:18:56,480
nope but he's hitting me

7332
09:19:00,480 --> 09:19:02,480
ok maybe aim for his body

7333
09:19:04,480 --> 09:19:06,480
I'm not safe

7334
09:19:07,480 --> 09:19:09,480
easier just do this

7335
09:19:10,480 --> 09:19:12,480
manually aiming

7336
09:19:16,480 --> 09:19:18,480
it is I'm actually hitting him

7337
09:19:18,480 --> 09:19:20,480
more like this

7338
09:19:20,480 --> 09:19:21,480
oh for fuck's sake I'm in

7339
09:19:21,480 --> 09:19:23,480
I'm aiming for his butt

7340
09:19:23,480 --> 09:19:25,480
go to sleep go to sleep

7341
09:19:25,480 --> 09:19:27,480
tranquilizer tranquilizer

7342
09:19:27,480 --> 09:19:29,480
serpentine serpentine

7343
09:19:32,480 --> 09:19:34,480
does he even have sleep damage

7344
09:19:38,480 --> 09:19:40,480
I

7345
09:19:41,480 --> 09:19:43,480
is he going for me

7346
09:19:43,480 --> 09:19:45,480
I think he might have been

7347
09:19:48,480 --> 09:19:50,480
is that a glitch

7348
09:19:50,480 --> 09:19:52,480
what happens if I do A

7349
09:19:52,480 --> 09:19:54,480
I don't know

7350
09:19:55,480 --> 09:19:57,480
don't look at me

7351
09:20:01,480 --> 09:20:03,480
oh shit they're just doing ultimate

7352
09:20:04,480 --> 09:20:06,480
oh his wee legs

7353
09:20:08,480 --> 09:20:10,480
uh

7354
09:20:13,480 --> 09:20:15,480
ok ok hold on a minute

7355
09:20:17,480 --> 09:20:19,480
we're in the 60s

7356
09:20:25,480 --> 09:20:27,480
uhh

7357
09:20:27,480 --> 09:20:29,480
um

7358
09:20:29,480 --> 09:20:31,480
um um um um um um um um um um

7359
09:20:37,480 --> 09:20:49,320
Um, I think I've lost question mark.

7360
09:20:49,320 --> 09:21:02,920
Um, gonna be honest, we'll try it a few more times.

7361
09:21:02,920 --> 09:21:10,640
I think we're better going back to, um, little snake man.

7362
09:21:10,640 --> 09:21:13,520
I think our odds are better with snakes.

7363
09:21:13,520 --> 09:21:15,000
Everyone just exploded.

7364
09:21:15,000 --> 09:21:20,000
Yes, I definitely agree with that thing.

7365
09:21:20,000 --> 09:21:23,520
I think we're in trouble.

7366
09:21:23,520 --> 09:21:32,480
Let's see, let's see, I'll keep doing my bow and arrow bleed effect.

7367
09:21:33,480 --> 09:21:36,640
Um, I don't mind doing that.

7368
09:21:36,640 --> 09:21:39,120
Maybe do some dungeon exploring.

7369
09:21:39,120 --> 09:21:46,320
Yeah, I think if we can't do this, I wouldn't actually mind going back to, um, limb grave

7370
09:21:46,320 --> 09:21:51,080
and getting like loads of different coconuts and stuff so we can all talk.

7371
09:21:51,080 --> 09:21:55,520
I think Bailey and the 18 inches of mesmer are equal in terms of difficulty.

7372
09:21:55,520 --> 09:21:57,400
Oh, oh no.

7373
09:21:57,400 --> 09:21:59,720
Oh no, this can't be.

7374
09:21:59,720 --> 09:22:05,520
Um, if that's the case, I might be more tempted to do some like caverns and stuff.

7375
09:22:05,520 --> 09:22:07,360
Elsewhere.

7376
09:22:07,360 --> 09:22:09,840
Although, what do I need to do?

7377
09:22:09,840 --> 09:22:13,480
I just need to level up my stuff.

7378
09:22:13,480 --> 09:22:14,480
Oh, wow.

7379
09:22:23,320 --> 09:22:25,320
I need to go on fire resistance.

7380
09:22:30,720 --> 09:22:36,040
I didn't even get a moment to breathe.

7381
09:22:36,040 --> 09:22:42,920
Remember when that one guy said, really, la, na, la, was similar in difficulty, honestly.

7382
09:22:42,920 --> 09:22:45,600
How far into the DLC?

7383
09:22:45,600 --> 09:22:48,040
We've somewhat uncovered everything.

7384
09:22:48,040 --> 09:22:53,440
We're stuck at a few bosses, so don't think you're out of your depth.

7385
09:22:53,440 --> 09:22:57,600
We're currently trying to, I don't want to spoil it, so close your ears if you don't

7386
09:22:57,600 --> 09:23:11,280
want to spoiler, but, um, mesmer halt progression, bail is just optional.

7387
09:23:11,280 --> 09:23:17,560
Okay, wait, hold on, who, where or who is mesmer, where is he?

7388
09:23:17,560 --> 09:23:25,360
Where are you mesmer, you little shit.

7389
09:23:25,360 --> 09:23:27,600
Dark chamber entrance?

7390
09:23:27,600 --> 09:23:28,600
Maybe?

7391
09:23:33,800 --> 09:23:34,800
Dark chamber?

7392
09:23:34,800 --> 09:23:35,800
Okay.

7393
09:23:35,800 --> 09:23:38,440
We're going to see what we can do at dark chamber.

7394
09:23:38,440 --> 09:23:43,960
If this is like the story of like, oh, you're supposed to do this next, um, I don't even

7395
09:23:43,960 --> 09:23:50,600
know if I have the reaction time to be able to, um, move out of his way when he's the

7396
09:23:50,600 --> 09:23:57,600
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the

7397
09:23:57,600 --> 09:24:02,600
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the

7398
09:24:02,600 --> 09:24:11,600
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the

7399
09:24:11,600 --> 09:24:19,600
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the

7400
09:24:19,600 --> 09:24:29,600
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the

7401
09:24:29,600 --> 09:24:38,420
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the

7402
09:24:38,420 --> 09:24:43,300
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the

7403
09:24:43,300 --> 09:24:46,800
one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who she's

7404
09:24:46,800 --> 09:25:00,320
He is just rapid fire I'm going for bleep sorry I accidentally did ace for a bit there that's

7405
09:25:00,320 --> 09:25:27,920
I like all the arrows staying in and I was actually kind of funny.

7406
09:25:27,920 --> 09:25:37,920
I dodge. Someone got a bleed on him. I don't know who it is but it's a team effort.

7407
09:25:37,920 --> 09:25:54,760
It's a team effort. Pincushion boss one and three. Right okay okay okay. He needs a minute

7408
09:25:54,760 --> 09:26:22,080
to get back off the ground. Okay we're not watching this. Why does he hate me so much?

7409
09:26:22,080 --> 09:26:50,780
I can't even comprehend what's going on I'm sorry I genuinely can. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.

7410
09:26:50,780 --> 09:27:04,240
okay I think we can do it I think we can do it I think we can do it I have I have

7411
09:27:04,240 --> 09:27:15,200
faith I think you did go into his house and attack him I have faith I think we

7412
09:27:15,200 --> 09:27:21,720
can do it I just won't absolutely walk myself and myself right so I do have

7413
09:27:21,720 --> 09:27:24,360
the lead

7414
09:27:27,520 --> 09:27:34,680
this place is supposed to change I'm wondering

7415
09:27:35,440 --> 09:27:42,000
oh it's a dwelling arrow it's not easy oh I'll do poison and bleep

7416
09:27:44,360 --> 09:27:47,360
I'll do poison and bleep

7417
09:27:50,360 --> 09:27:54,800
we just in norm did you have a chance

7418
09:27:54,800 --> 09:27:58,840
men's room probably actually easier than bail with three people but all the

7419
09:27:58,840 --> 09:28:03,640
space one attack small space are relatively small and no area yeah I think we

7420
09:28:03,640 --> 09:28:16,520
can do it flinch files flinched flies what's this raises stamina boost fire

7421
09:28:16,520 --> 09:28:22,080
damage negation yeah I'm gonna put on that just because it's how unbelievably cruel

7422
09:28:22,080 --> 09:28:29,520
that guy is ready wow let me get out of the way so we just corner me with that

7423
09:28:29,600 --> 09:28:32,120
fireball

7424
09:28:35,240 --> 09:28:38,240
I still hit

7425
09:28:44,880 --> 09:28:51,920
wait I'll go for poison first I guess oh wait snake be poisoned I don't know if

7426
09:28:51,920 --> 09:29:01,360
snake are considered poisonable we'll find out shortly is he green

7427
09:29:04,360 --> 09:29:08,360
that is so terrifying that move

7428
09:29:14,520 --> 09:29:17,520
maybe we're to see

7429
09:29:22,920 --> 09:29:30,920
oh my god he just hammers and hammers and hammers

7430
09:29:37,920 --> 09:29:46,600
the fact I am still moving after that shows how tarnished or so OP

7431
09:29:51,920 --> 09:29:53,920
I

7432
09:30:00,640 --> 09:30:05,040
tried to bleed oh yeah you got it

7433
09:30:08,160 --> 09:30:11,560
it's not moving

7434
09:30:13,800 --> 09:30:20,200
just be careful I will skip the animation

7435
09:30:20,200 --> 09:30:24,360
okay I'm gonna skip the animation

7436
09:30:24,360 --> 09:30:33,080
oh and the attack stage of course the stage

7437
09:30:34,080 --> 09:30:39,760
hey we fling I can sure

7438
09:30:48,280 --> 09:30:53,360
there's an MCC helping us as well

7439
09:30:58,760 --> 09:31:01,960
trying to get bleak damage

7440
09:31:03,080 --> 09:31:05,080
I

7441
09:31:10,600 --> 09:31:14,840
and PC do you want to do anything

7442
09:31:21,560 --> 09:31:27,960
are the NPC no one rare which we fling had the dark moon

7443
09:31:28,700 --> 09:31:32,860
I think they may have gone asleep no

7444
09:31:34,980 --> 09:31:39,300
yeah Russian is your turn

7445
09:31:48,300 --> 09:31:50,300
I survived a party

7446
09:31:57,960 --> 09:32:01,960
He's not got a face on there, more hands to the love pick, even his mum and her despises.

7447
09:32:03,960 --> 09:32:05,960
Right, we're going for it.

7448
09:32:05,960 --> 09:32:07,960
We've got champions and stuff going on.

7449
09:32:07,960 --> 09:32:11,960
Right, let me move to the side and dodge this, should be the chart.

7450
09:32:11,960 --> 09:32:15,960
So, dodge it and then run away.

7451
09:32:17,960 --> 09:32:19,960
I can't do...

7452
09:32:19,960 --> 09:32:22,960
I actually can't do it, lol.

7453
09:32:23,960 --> 09:32:26,960
Fuckin' hell.

7454
09:32:30,960 --> 09:32:32,960
He's actually pretty...

7455
09:32:32,960 --> 09:32:36,960
Taking a decent chunk of damage from a weak book.

7456
09:32:36,960 --> 09:32:38,960
Can you not...

7457
09:32:38,960 --> 09:32:40,960
Can you not change enemy at the last second?

7458
09:32:40,960 --> 09:32:42,960
It really messes me up.

7459
09:32:44,960 --> 09:32:46,960
Sorry.

7460
09:32:53,960 --> 09:32:59,960
I think this might be the old, we need a mage type thing and then I'll try and take the aggro.

7461
09:32:59,960 --> 09:33:01,960
And then melee can try and stun.

7462
09:33:05,960 --> 09:33:08,960
Fuckin' hell, blind us in the middle of battle.

7463
09:33:08,960 --> 09:33:11,960
But in a humorous way.

7464
09:33:11,960 --> 09:33:23,960
Oh, he just changed up on that third refling.

7465
09:33:32,960 --> 09:33:34,960
Wait, am I alive?

7466
09:33:34,960 --> 09:33:37,960
Holy shit, I thought I was gone.

7467
09:33:41,960 --> 09:33:54,960
Oh, man.

7468
09:33:54,960 --> 09:33:56,960
Oh, I got crit!

7469
09:33:56,960 --> 09:33:59,960
Oh, shit, he got crit on me though.

7470
09:33:59,960 --> 09:34:03,960
Oh, no, he got me, I don't survive this.

7471
09:34:04,960 --> 09:34:07,960
Oh!

7472
09:34:07,960 --> 09:34:09,960
I think we can do it.

7473
09:34:09,960 --> 09:34:13,960
I think we can do it, we just need to compliment each other a bit more.

7474
09:34:13,960 --> 09:34:17,960
Oh, your hair's looking great today.

7475
09:34:17,960 --> 09:34:19,960
Oh, he switches so quick.

7476
09:34:19,960 --> 09:34:27,960
Literally the 5 M blow he does, he like swaps between 3 of us at one point.

7477
09:34:27,960 --> 09:34:30,960
I don't think he takes poison damage.

7478
09:34:31,960 --> 09:34:35,960
Back from my work and I say I believe in mommy and the refling.

7479
09:34:35,960 --> 09:34:38,960
I think this is the last one in me, like unironic.

7480
09:34:38,960 --> 09:34:40,960
Oh god, I can't remember, I didn't have...

7481
09:34:40,960 --> 09:34:42,960
I definitely didn't have you.

7482
09:34:45,960 --> 09:34:48,960
I feel like I had you in either, yeah.

7483
09:34:48,960 --> 09:34:50,960
This is definitely my last one.

7484
09:34:50,960 --> 09:34:54,960
My eyes are like fuckin' falling out of the sockets right now.

7485
09:34:54,960 --> 09:34:57,960
I'm sure we can bend from any direction too.

7486
09:34:57,960 --> 09:35:00,960
But I think we can do it, I think we can do it, we just do it.

7487
09:35:00,960 --> 09:35:02,960
Hiya!

7488
09:35:02,960 --> 09:35:05,960
I think we need any blessings?

7489
09:35:05,960 --> 09:35:07,960
Is that a blessing on us?

7490
09:35:07,960 --> 09:35:09,960
Any more blessings?

7491
09:35:09,960 --> 09:35:11,960
Let's do it, let's do it.

7492
09:35:11,960 --> 09:35:13,960
Let's do it, let's do it.

7493
09:35:13,960 --> 09:35:15,960
Did I just need a run this time?

7494
09:35:17,960 --> 09:35:22,960
Oh, I need to wait like a millisecond before I do the next roll.

7495
09:35:23,960 --> 09:35:25,960
Okay.

7496
09:35:26,960 --> 09:35:28,960
What are you doing?

7497
09:35:32,960 --> 09:35:35,960
I'm not focused enough for this.

7498
09:35:35,960 --> 09:35:38,960
Mommy's time.

7499
09:35:38,960 --> 09:35:40,960
Unironic then.

7500
09:35:40,960 --> 09:35:43,960
Oh frickin' just think I just healed up.

7501
09:35:43,960 --> 09:35:46,960
I need just another one and then...

7502
09:35:46,960 --> 09:35:48,960
Okay, there we go.

7503
09:35:48,960 --> 09:35:50,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

7504
09:35:53,960 --> 09:35:57,960
I'm trying to take the aggro, but it ain't happening.

7505
09:36:05,960 --> 09:36:07,960
Okay.

7506
09:36:10,960 --> 09:36:12,960
Azze, azze.

7507
09:36:15,960 --> 09:36:19,960
So I ain't gonna make it to the snake-flicking tier.

7508
09:36:19,960 --> 09:36:23,960
I don't know how I dodged that with no attempt to dodge that.

7509
09:36:23,960 --> 09:36:26,960
No, no, no, not like this.

7510
09:36:27,960 --> 09:36:30,960
Not like this, not like this.

7511
09:36:31,960 --> 09:36:36,960
I don't even think there's a Wikipedia on like, is he poison immune?

7512
09:36:40,960 --> 09:36:43,960
I don't think he's a poison immune as far as I'm aware.

7513
09:36:50,960 --> 09:36:54,960
Although I haven't seen poison go on him, so I'm gonna make a stop.

7514
09:36:55,960 --> 09:36:58,960
Maybe time for the crossbow.

7515
09:37:00,960 --> 09:37:03,960
Hopefully you aren't having nightmares of him.

7516
09:37:04,960 --> 09:37:09,960
It's interesting to see their attack pattern when you don't fight back.

7517
09:37:12,960 --> 09:37:14,960
Hopefully you aren't not.

7518
09:37:14,960 --> 09:37:16,960
Check.

7519
09:37:16,960 --> 09:37:18,960
Mm-hmm.

7520
09:37:19,960 --> 09:37:21,960
What are you saying?

7521
09:37:24,960 --> 09:37:27,960
Well, maybe use my crossbow bolt instead.

7522
09:37:28,960 --> 09:37:37,960
If I do my rapid-fire blood crossbow bolt, it causes rapid-fire crossbow, and then...

7523
09:37:38,960 --> 09:37:42,960
And I do... I can do scarlet rot, and do frost.

7524
09:37:43,960 --> 09:37:46,960
I think frost and baked shrilly.

7525
09:37:46,960 --> 09:37:51,960
I honestly thought it sounded like an alternate word, so I'm gonna be honest.

7526
09:37:52,960 --> 09:37:54,960
I didn't have you in the last fight.

7527
09:37:56,960 --> 09:37:57,960
Right.

7528
09:37:57,960 --> 09:38:02,960
I didn't have you in the last fight, and I didn't have you in the last fight, I'm pretty sure.

7529
09:38:03,960 --> 09:38:05,960
I'm a 9% sure.

7530
09:38:05,960 --> 09:38:06,960
Maybe 8%.

7531
09:38:06,960 --> 09:38:08,960
I messed up, I'm sorry.

7532
09:38:08,960 --> 09:38:09,960
No, don't be sorry.

7533
09:38:09,960 --> 09:38:11,960
We're just giving up playing him.

7534
09:38:11,960 --> 09:38:12,960
I'm having a good time.

7535
09:38:12,960 --> 09:38:13,960
I may sound tired.

7536
09:38:13,960 --> 09:38:14,960
Don't get me wrong.

7537
09:38:14,960 --> 09:38:20,960
I may sound exhausted, but it's nothing to do with the game, and it's nothing to do with these things.

7538
09:38:20,960 --> 09:38:25,960
It's just I've been having lack of a deep sleep.

7539
09:38:26,960 --> 09:38:31,960
And then I took medication to try and force myself to sleep, and it just was the nightmare.

7540
09:38:32,960 --> 09:38:35,960
Okay, dodge, wait, dodge.

7541
09:38:35,960 --> 09:38:37,960
Yeah, okay, dodge, wait, dodge.

7542
09:38:37,960 --> 09:38:38,960
There we go.

7543
09:38:39,960 --> 09:38:41,960
Okay, we're gonna use the ultimate.

7544
09:38:44,960 --> 09:38:47,960
We're gonna miss everything in the ultimate, but that's okay.

7545
09:38:49,960 --> 09:38:50,960
Okay.

7546
09:38:53,960 --> 09:38:54,960
Okay.

7547
09:38:54,960 --> 09:38:55,960
Okay.

7548
09:39:00,960 --> 09:39:05,960
I'm wondering if everyone needs to wear the fire talisman to negate more of his attack.

7549
09:39:07,960 --> 09:39:09,960
Okay, we're gonna...

7550
09:39:14,960 --> 09:39:16,960
Miss all the walls.

7551
09:39:18,960 --> 09:39:20,960
I just did the bleed.

7552
09:39:21,960 --> 09:39:22,960
Oh.

7553
09:39:23,960 --> 09:39:25,960
And just like that.

7554
09:39:25,960 --> 09:39:27,960
And then there should be another attack and another.

7555
09:39:30,960 --> 09:39:31,960
Oh.

7556
09:39:33,960 --> 09:39:34,960
Oh, shit, the NPC.

7557
09:39:34,960 --> 09:39:35,960
Maybe I should bring them in.

7558
09:39:35,960 --> 09:39:36,960
Sorry, hold on.

7559
09:39:36,960 --> 09:39:39,960
Let me bring in the NPC to take the heat off of everyone a bit.

7560
09:39:41,960 --> 09:39:42,960
It's such cold summon.

7561
09:39:42,960 --> 09:39:43,960
Oh, I can't.

7562
09:39:46,960 --> 09:39:48,960
Only when a frickin' refland is down...

7563
09:39:51,960 --> 09:39:52,960
Okay.

7564
09:40:06,960 --> 09:40:07,960
Too early.

7565
09:40:21,960 --> 09:40:22,960
I'm missing.

7566
09:40:26,960 --> 09:40:27,960
I'm actually gonna heal.

7567
09:40:28,960 --> 09:40:29,960
Did we get sneak fees?

7568
09:40:33,960 --> 09:40:35,960
I did not expect that switch.

7569
09:40:41,960 --> 09:40:43,960
Oh, no, skipping.

7570
09:40:44,960 --> 09:40:46,960
Please, thanks for not getting me.

7571
09:40:51,960 --> 09:40:52,960
Crazy.

7572
09:41:14,960 --> 09:41:15,960
Sorry, I'm trying.

7573
09:41:15,960 --> 09:41:16,960
I'm trying.

7574
09:41:19,960 --> 09:41:20,960
I'm trying.

7575
09:41:25,960 --> 09:41:28,960
I just need to apply a few bleeds, so that's all I need.

7576
09:41:33,960 --> 09:41:34,960
Yeah, they're trying me.

7577
09:41:34,960 --> 09:41:35,960
Okay.

7578
09:41:44,960 --> 09:41:47,960
It seems like the snake, when the snake goes up, you need to delay your dodging.

7579
09:41:48,960 --> 09:41:50,960
This part, I don't know about dodging.

7580
09:41:50,960 --> 09:41:51,960
Okay.

7581
09:41:56,960 --> 09:41:57,960
I need to heal.

7582
09:42:03,960 --> 09:42:06,960
We just can hardly do any damage on them.

7583
09:42:06,960 --> 09:42:07,960
That's the problem.

7584
09:42:10,960 --> 09:42:11,960
Oh, I'm out.

7585
09:42:11,960 --> 09:42:12,960
Jesus, I'm out of bleeds.

7586
09:42:13,960 --> 09:42:23,960
I'm applying cross, whether or not it's gonna achieve anything is a different story, but...

7587
09:42:26,960 --> 09:42:28,960
Fuckin' hell.

7588
09:42:30,960 --> 09:42:31,960
It's a barrage.

7589
09:42:31,960 --> 09:42:33,960
This has to be his ultimate.

7590
09:42:33,960 --> 09:42:35,960
This has to be the ultimate.

7591
09:42:36,960 --> 09:42:38,960
There is nothing more he can do.

7592
09:42:38,960 --> 09:42:40,960
That's ridiculous.

7593
09:42:43,960 --> 09:42:46,960
He cannot have another ultimate in him.

7594
09:42:46,960 --> 09:42:47,960
Oh, but he does.

7595
09:42:47,960 --> 09:42:49,960
Oh, but he does.

7596
09:42:50,960 --> 09:42:52,960
He's summoning them at will.

7597
09:42:57,960 --> 09:43:01,960
Yeah, I don't think I can apply cross to this guy.

7598
09:43:06,960 --> 09:43:09,960
Okay, let me go up and dodge.

7599
09:43:09,960 --> 09:43:11,960
Oh, wow, I thought I had that.

7600
09:43:13,960 --> 09:43:14,960
I thought I had that nailed.

7601
09:43:14,960 --> 09:43:15,960
Maybe not.

7602
09:43:15,960 --> 09:43:17,960
Oh, he's still going for me.

7603
09:43:17,960 --> 09:43:19,960
Shit, sorry, I thought he was gonna change.

7604
09:43:30,960 --> 09:43:32,960
Seems like cross damage is applied on him.

7605
09:43:32,960 --> 09:43:34,960
He's just bleeding.

7606
09:43:37,960 --> 09:43:39,960
Wait, did we tell her?

7607
09:43:40,960 --> 09:43:42,960
What, he doesn't...

7608
09:43:43,960 --> 09:43:45,960
That was a good attempt.

7609
09:43:47,960 --> 09:43:49,960
Can someone give mommy a physical shield?

7610
09:43:49,960 --> 09:43:51,960
You can do a shield and crossbow.

7611
09:43:57,960 --> 09:44:00,960
Wait, hold on, I might need to pull it some equipment.

7612
09:44:10,960 --> 09:44:13,960
It's apparently so, but I don't believe you.

7613
09:44:18,960 --> 09:44:20,960
I couldn't land full on everything.

7614
09:44:22,960 --> 09:44:23,960
No, I'm not.

7615
09:44:26,960 --> 09:44:29,960
I don't seem to think I have a stroke.

7616
09:44:34,960 --> 09:44:35,960
Mm-hmm.

7617
09:44:39,960 --> 09:44:42,960
Yeah, crossbow works one-handed down this part.

7618
09:44:43,960 --> 09:44:45,960
But the EI becomes so weird with the part.

7619
09:44:48,960 --> 09:44:50,960
Chat, what'd I get from Willy?

7620
09:44:50,960 --> 09:44:53,960
You eat an entire chicken to yourself?

7621
09:44:53,960 --> 09:44:54,960
Honestly?

7622
09:44:56,960 --> 09:44:58,960
Willy's chicken to all of us.

7623
09:44:59,960 --> 09:45:00,960
I don't think he even...

7624
09:45:00,960 --> 09:45:02,960
I've never seen him get fucking...

7625
09:45:03,960 --> 09:45:05,960
I can see him get blood loss.

7626
09:45:05,960 --> 09:45:07,960
I've never fucking seen him get bloody frostbite.

7627
09:45:07,960 --> 09:45:09,960
Well, I'll just try anyway.

7628
09:45:10,960 --> 09:45:12,960
I don't think he can get frostbite.

7629
09:45:13,960 --> 09:45:14,960
Willy's...

7630
09:45:16,960 --> 09:45:18,960
There's fire on them.

7631
09:45:20,960 --> 09:45:22,960
Meteor has...

7632
09:45:23,960 --> 09:45:24,960
Attack power magic.

7633
09:45:24,960 --> 09:45:26,960
Is he susceptible to magic?

7634
09:45:27,960 --> 09:45:29,960
He's like, skinny...

7635
09:45:29,960 --> 09:45:31,960
He's skinny mainly.

7636
09:45:32,960 --> 09:45:35,960
And he's magic himself, so why would he?

7637
09:45:38,960 --> 09:45:41,960
I'm trying my Willy Ricans, I'm trying.

7638
09:45:45,960 --> 09:45:47,960
I'll look if I have a shield to go.

7639
09:45:47,960 --> 09:45:49,960
Yeah, crossbow's gonna let the shield go down.

7640
09:45:49,960 --> 09:45:51,960
I have a shield to go down.

7641
09:45:52,960 --> 09:45:54,960
Okay, I have a shield, hold on.

7642
09:45:55,960 --> 09:45:56,960
Maybe a little bit?

7643
09:45:56,960 --> 09:45:58,960
I'll let him do that one.

7644
09:45:59,960 --> 09:46:00,960
Uh...

7645
09:46:01,960 --> 09:46:02,960
Maybe a little bit?

7646
09:46:02,960 --> 09:46:03,960
I don't know.

7647
09:46:03,960 --> 09:46:05,960
There's some dirt that we have.

7648
09:46:07,960 --> 09:46:09,960
Wait, so what happens if I shield?

7649
09:46:12,960 --> 09:46:13,960
Oh wait.

7650
09:46:13,960 --> 09:46:14,960
I don't think I'll do that, sorry.

7651
09:46:14,960 --> 09:46:16,960
I'm just gonna put that one in there.

7652
09:46:20,960 --> 09:46:22,960
What'd that do?

7653
09:46:24,960 --> 09:46:26,960
Okay, the Ricans are trying to help.

7654
09:46:26,960 --> 09:46:27,960
He's not had a shot.

7655
09:46:27,960 --> 09:46:28,960
Or is everyone...

7656
09:46:28,960 --> 09:46:30,960
Oh, you've not had a shot.

7657
09:46:32,960 --> 09:46:34,960
It boosts my damage.

7658
09:46:34,960 --> 09:46:35,960
Okay.

7659
09:46:36,960 --> 09:46:37,960
Okay.

7660
09:46:38,960 --> 09:46:40,960
Honestly, I'm tempted to...

7661
09:46:41,960 --> 09:46:43,960
Do you have to try this one?

7662
09:46:44,960 --> 09:46:46,960
I don't think it's gonna work.

7663
09:46:48,960 --> 09:46:49,960
Radar Arrow is good.

7664
09:46:49,960 --> 09:46:51,960
Radar Arrow?

7665
09:46:53,960 --> 09:46:54,960
Radar, yeah.

7666
09:46:57,960 --> 09:46:58,960
Hi!

7667
09:46:58,960 --> 09:46:59,960
This is Radar?

7668
09:47:01,960 --> 09:47:03,960
But, who read that wrong?

7669
09:47:05,960 --> 09:47:06,960
Radar Arrow is so good.

7670
09:47:06,960 --> 09:47:07,960
I'm so sorry.

7671
09:47:07,960 --> 09:47:09,960
I'm losing my ability to read and speak and think

7672
09:47:09,960 --> 09:47:11,960
and do anything pretty much at the same time.

7673
09:47:12,960 --> 09:47:14,960
Okay, are we ready?

7674
09:47:16,960 --> 09:47:17,960
I don't know about the shield.

7675
09:47:17,960 --> 09:47:18,960
Okay, like that.

7676
09:47:18,960 --> 09:47:19,960
Wow.

7677
09:47:19,960 --> 09:47:21,960
I've never used the shield before.

7678
09:47:21,960 --> 09:47:22,960
I'm gonna be honest.

7679
09:47:22,960 --> 09:47:23,960
Oh, Radar's Arrow.

7680
09:47:23,960 --> 09:47:24,960
Oh my God, sorry.

7681
09:47:24,960 --> 09:47:26,960
You're correct in yourself.

7682
09:47:26,960 --> 09:47:28,960
Right, let him come in.

7683
09:47:29,960 --> 09:47:31,960
Oh, I was fartily on the pause there.

7684
09:47:36,960 --> 09:47:37,960
Uh...

7685
09:47:39,960 --> 09:47:40,960
What the fuck?

7686
09:47:41,960 --> 09:47:44,960
Wait, I can't rapid fire over the crossbow now.

7687
09:47:45,960 --> 09:47:47,960
Uh, I mean, I guess.

7688
09:47:50,960 --> 09:47:53,960
Oh, this guy is not getting around.

7689
09:47:55,960 --> 09:47:56,960
How about I stop?

7690
09:47:59,960 --> 09:48:00,960
Another lie.

7691
09:48:00,960 --> 09:48:02,960
That kinda hurt.

7692
09:48:02,960 --> 09:48:03,960
That kinda hurt kinda.

7693
09:48:05,960 --> 09:48:07,960
Oh, I'm getting things off.

7694
09:48:07,960 --> 09:48:08,960
Oh, blue crab.

7695
09:48:12,960 --> 09:48:13,960
Yeah, I'm healed up.

7696
09:48:22,960 --> 09:48:23,960
Fuck me.

7697
09:48:23,960 --> 09:48:25,960
I don't know how to manage that one.

7698
09:48:25,960 --> 09:48:26,960
Oh, wait, sorry.

7699
09:48:29,960 --> 09:48:30,960
Flash me.

7700
09:48:35,960 --> 09:48:39,960
The only reason I'm putting that away for now is to fucking...

7701
09:48:41,960 --> 09:48:42,960
Oh, shit.

7702
09:48:45,960 --> 09:48:46,960
I missed everything.

7703
09:48:46,960 --> 09:48:47,960
Okay.

7704
09:48:54,960 --> 09:48:55,960
Ah.

7705
09:49:03,960 --> 09:49:05,960
I don't know what to do.

7706
09:49:06,960 --> 09:49:08,960
Got hurt, weaselings.

7707
09:49:10,960 --> 09:49:11,960
I think mommy's all it is.

7708
09:49:11,960 --> 09:49:12,960
Stop fucking with me.

7709
09:49:12,960 --> 09:49:14,960
She about lasted me again.

7710
09:49:16,960 --> 09:49:17,960
Oh.

7711
09:49:22,960 --> 09:49:23,960
Oh, shit.

7712
09:49:26,960 --> 09:49:27,960
Wait.

7713
09:49:30,960 --> 09:49:32,960
Wait, we tried to miss.

7714
09:49:32,960 --> 09:49:35,960
You have to buy them, but they're only good to go with.

7715
09:49:39,960 --> 09:49:42,960
Wow, is there any way we can explore, maybe?

7716
09:49:47,960 --> 09:49:49,960
Maybe we go explore instead.

7717
09:49:49,960 --> 09:49:51,960
There was that weird bit down here.

7718
09:49:51,960 --> 09:49:52,960
This!

7719
09:49:52,960 --> 09:49:53,960
I wanna...

7720
09:49:53,960 --> 09:49:56,960
I see purple on the map, so I'm gonna go down here.

7721
09:49:56,960 --> 09:49:57,960
How do I go down here?

7722
09:49:58,960 --> 09:49:59,960
I can't remember.

7723
09:49:59,960 --> 09:50:01,960
I don't think there's a safe safe here.

7724
09:50:01,960 --> 09:50:02,960
I don't know.

7725
09:50:02,960 --> 09:50:03,960
Oh.

7726
09:50:04,960 --> 09:50:05,960
I discovered all of that.

7727
09:50:05,960 --> 09:50:07,960
I think they need it.

7728
09:50:08,960 --> 09:50:09,960
Um...

7729
09:50:13,960 --> 09:50:15,960
Am I gonna go down this way?

7730
09:50:17,960 --> 09:50:18,960
It looks like there's a little path.

7731
09:50:18,960 --> 09:50:20,960
If I somehow make my way down there,

7732
09:50:20,960 --> 09:50:22,960
if I somehow go there...

7733
09:50:22,960 --> 09:50:23,960
Why not really?

7734
09:50:24,960 --> 09:50:25,960
There's some.

7735
09:50:25,960 --> 09:50:27,960
I hide in a clutch shield that needs strength.

7736
09:50:27,960 --> 09:50:28,960
Do you want it?

7737
09:50:28,960 --> 09:50:30,960
I don't know if I'm gonna use shields.

7738
09:50:30,960 --> 09:50:32,960
I'm absolutely married with them.

7739
09:50:32,960 --> 09:50:34,960
Or does it just boost my defense overall?

7740
09:50:34,960 --> 09:50:36,960
Like, I don't have to do anything special with them.

7741
09:50:37,960 --> 09:50:38,960
Or, like...

7742
09:50:38,960 --> 09:50:40,960
I've never parried an attack.

7743
09:50:40,960 --> 09:50:42,960
That's what I'm trying to say.

7744
09:50:42,960 --> 09:50:44,960
I've never parried an attack.

7745
09:50:44,960 --> 09:50:45,960
So...

7746
09:50:48,960 --> 09:50:49,960
I'll tell you what.

7747
09:50:49,960 --> 09:50:51,960
I might go here,

7748
09:50:51,960 --> 09:50:54,960
and then raid my wee horse all the way up this river,

7749
09:50:54,960 --> 09:50:56,960
and see what's going on over here.

7750
09:51:03,960 --> 09:51:05,960
There's a ladder you have to get down there.

7751
09:51:05,960 --> 09:51:07,960
It's on the bridge before the storehouse.

7752
09:51:12,960 --> 09:51:14,960
There's a secret coffin in the castle

7753
09:51:14,960 --> 09:51:16,960
that fast travels through to the desert.

7754
09:51:17,960 --> 09:51:19,960
The castle we've already cleared.

7755
09:51:21,960 --> 09:51:24,960
Go to storehouse first.

7756
09:51:26,960 --> 09:51:27,960
Do you think?

7757
09:51:27,960 --> 09:51:28,960
One second.

7758
09:51:29,960 --> 09:51:30,960
Oh, alright.

7759
09:51:33,960 --> 09:51:34,960
Wait, horse.

7760
09:51:35,960 --> 09:51:36,960
First floor.

7761
09:51:38,960 --> 09:51:39,960
Storehouse first floor.

7762
09:51:39,960 --> 09:51:41,960
I don't know if I can call you guys in there.

7763
09:51:43,960 --> 09:51:46,960
I don't know if I can tell you in there.

7764
09:51:47,960 --> 09:51:48,960
I'm sure I can.

7765
09:51:51,960 --> 09:51:53,960
Like, fucking God, I can.

7766
09:51:54,960 --> 09:51:56,960
I don't want to be undone the Samoan.

7767
09:51:56,960 --> 09:51:58,960
I don't want to be undone the Samoan.

7768
09:51:59,960 --> 09:52:03,960
Okay, we're in storehouse first floor.

7769
09:52:04,960 --> 09:52:06,960
And you guys are going to get...

7770
09:52:15,960 --> 09:52:16,960
Samoan.

7771
09:52:18,960 --> 09:52:19,960
Is that you?

7772
09:52:21,960 --> 09:52:22,960
That's you.

7773
09:52:22,960 --> 09:52:24,960
Okay, okay, it's you.

7774
09:52:24,960 --> 09:52:25,960
Hold on.

7775
09:52:25,960 --> 09:52:27,960
There's a coffin in the storehouse.

7776
09:52:30,960 --> 09:52:32,960
I think it might be your turn.

7777
09:52:33,960 --> 09:52:34,960
I don't know.

7778
09:52:36,960 --> 09:52:38,960
How are you making even more noise?

7779
09:52:42,960 --> 09:52:43,960
I think.

7780
09:52:45,960 --> 09:52:48,960
I'm so sorry, I can't remember the order anymore.

7781
09:52:54,960 --> 09:52:56,960
Puddlefish and asparagus.

7782
09:52:56,960 --> 09:52:57,960
Wait.

7783
09:52:58,960 --> 09:53:00,960
Is that a South Park?

7784
09:53:01,960 --> 09:53:02,960
What do you want me to eat?

7785
09:53:03,960 --> 09:53:06,960
Puddlefish and asparagus or something like that?

7786
09:53:10,960 --> 09:53:11,960
Are we ready?

7787
09:53:11,960 --> 09:53:13,960
Hello, thank you for coming to my service.

7788
09:53:13,960 --> 09:53:16,960
Okay, let me put my sword on.

7789
09:53:16,960 --> 09:53:20,960
Sit wet all over the house with sword if you're not sure.

7790
09:53:26,960 --> 09:53:28,960
Okay, let's go.

7791
09:53:29,960 --> 09:53:32,960
I'm on my way.

7792
09:53:32,960 --> 09:53:36,960
Sit wet all over the house with sword if you're not sure.

7793
09:53:38,960 --> 09:53:41,960
Sit wet all over the house with sword if you're not sure.

7794
09:53:41,960 --> 09:53:43,960
Why is he keeping that?

7795
09:53:44,960 --> 09:53:46,960
Okay, you perish.

7796
09:53:46,960 --> 09:53:47,960
We're not having anything.

7797
09:53:47,960 --> 09:53:49,960
Get your poise out of here.

7798
09:53:49,960 --> 09:53:51,960
Let's not pretend you didn't have any poise.

7799
09:53:52,960 --> 09:53:53,960
Break him.

7800
09:53:53,960 --> 09:53:55,960
Break this man.

7801
09:53:56,960 --> 09:53:58,960
Okay, I'm out of stamina.

7802
09:53:58,960 --> 09:54:00,960
We're going to break him now.

7803
09:54:14,960 --> 09:54:17,960
Whoa, get in jump with the reef.

7804
09:54:20,960 --> 09:54:22,960
Get in jump with the reef.

7805
09:54:22,960 --> 09:54:24,960
Get in the reef.

7806
09:54:29,960 --> 09:54:31,960
Okay, they don't have much.

7807
09:54:31,960 --> 09:54:34,960
Like hold the rope.

7808
09:54:34,960 --> 09:54:36,960
Still a rip pickle.

7809
09:54:36,960 --> 09:54:38,960
Check and see if we can move.

7810
09:54:39,960 --> 09:54:41,960
We man ready to jump me go.

7811
09:54:48,960 --> 09:54:50,960
Oh shit.

7812
09:54:50,960 --> 09:54:51,960
Whoa, why?

7813
09:54:51,960 --> 09:54:53,960
God, he's actually so small.

7814
09:54:53,960 --> 09:54:55,960
I can't even hit him.

7815
09:55:04,960 --> 09:55:06,960
I wish I had that helmet.

7816
09:55:09,960 --> 09:55:11,960
Don't fall in the water.

7817
09:55:13,960 --> 09:55:15,960
Careful when you put a light on.

7818
09:55:15,960 --> 09:55:18,960
If you darken this cistern.

7819
09:55:19,960 --> 09:55:22,960
You don't need to get that hat.

7820
09:55:25,960 --> 09:55:27,960
Oh my god, this is so fun.

7821
09:55:27,960 --> 09:55:30,960
You should make a game about going deeper into the earth.

7822
09:55:30,960 --> 09:55:32,960
And you just get to slide around and stuff.

7823
09:55:32,960 --> 09:55:34,960
Oh, picture.

7824
09:55:34,960 --> 09:55:35,960
What do you do?

7825
09:55:35,960 --> 09:55:37,960
Hello, Mr. Picture.

7826
09:55:37,960 --> 09:55:39,960
Domain of dragons painting.

7827
09:55:41,960 --> 09:55:42,960
Curious.

7828
09:55:42,960 --> 09:55:44,960
Fake wall.

7829
09:55:45,960 --> 09:55:47,960
I'm just so good at it.

7830
09:55:49,960 --> 09:55:51,960
Could you guys see that that was open?

7831
09:55:51,960 --> 09:55:53,960
Because you've already been here before?

7832
09:55:53,960 --> 09:55:56,960
I'm just checking there's nothing behind us.

7833
09:55:56,960 --> 09:55:58,960
I don't trust this game.

7834
09:55:58,960 --> 09:56:00,960
Oh, we do the coffin again.

7835
09:56:00,960 --> 09:56:03,960
Oh my god, it's the coffin of Ali, Andy and Lily.

7836
09:56:03,960 --> 09:56:05,960
The hit tool.

7837
09:56:05,960 --> 09:56:06,960
Wait.

7838
09:56:06,960 --> 09:56:09,960
Oh, it doesn't let me interact when you guys are here.

7839
09:56:10,960 --> 09:56:13,960
I was going to say let's all fit in at the same time.

7840
09:56:14,960 --> 09:56:16,960
And whatever happens, pass it.

7841
09:56:17,960 --> 09:56:19,960
But we can't open it.

7842
09:56:23,960 --> 09:56:25,960
Oh, I've got a little mantat.

7843
09:56:26,960 --> 09:56:28,960
Rest in the coffin.

7844
09:56:28,960 --> 09:56:31,960
The one bit of sleep I've had this entire journey.

7845
09:56:32,960 --> 09:56:35,960
I did enjoy it in the game though.

7846
09:56:35,960 --> 09:56:47,960
I assume the tarnish knew it was going to fall and the tarnish wasn't just like,

7847
09:56:47,960 --> 09:56:49,960
oh, I'm going for the wee nap, right?

7848
09:56:49,960 --> 09:56:50,960
Surely.

7849
09:56:52,960 --> 09:56:58,960
Surely the tarnish knew it was going to fall down and not just be like, oh, where am I?

7850
09:56:59,960 --> 09:57:02,960
I mean, I'm probably that daft, but...

7851
09:57:06,960 --> 09:57:11,960
Let's start some.

7852
09:57:11,960 --> 09:57:13,960
See him a mile off.

7853
09:57:13,960 --> 09:57:15,960
I don't exactly what the model does.

7854
09:57:19,960 --> 09:57:20,960
Yeah, I know they've returned to their world.

7855
09:57:20,960 --> 09:57:22,960
You boot them out, you twats.

7856
09:57:22,960 --> 09:57:24,960
All right, there's a suit thing here.

7857
09:57:29,960 --> 09:57:30,960
Wow.

7858
09:57:31,960 --> 09:57:33,960
Wait, I'm heavy rolling.

7859
09:57:33,960 --> 09:57:34,960
What did I change?

7860
09:57:35,960 --> 09:57:36,960
Wait, am I going crazy?

7861
09:57:36,960 --> 09:57:38,960
Why am I heavy rolling?

7862
09:57:39,960 --> 09:57:40,960
Oh, because of the shield.

7863
09:57:40,960 --> 09:57:41,960
Get that one.

7864
09:57:41,960 --> 09:57:42,960
Get that shield.

7865
09:57:43,960 --> 09:57:44,960
Okay, there we go.

7866
09:57:46,960 --> 09:57:49,960
Wait, I can't come on the new area.

7867
09:57:52,960 --> 09:57:54,960
What do you just mean to do?

7868
09:57:54,960 --> 09:57:56,960
Oh, we're right in front of the thing!

7869
09:57:58,960 --> 09:58:01,960
We try to make it if there's an enemy over there.

7870
09:58:02,960 --> 09:58:04,960
Well, let me put a finger down here.

7871
09:58:05,960 --> 09:58:10,960
Put a finger down if you sucked my boyfriend out at the back of Denny's or whatever that

7872
09:58:10,960 --> 09:58:12,960
by room was, I can't remember.

7873
09:58:16,960 --> 09:58:20,960
I have just discovered what the boss fate is here.

7874
09:58:31,960 --> 09:58:36,960
Um, this...

7875
09:58:38,960 --> 09:58:43,960
I mean, can I scoot past and get to a safe point under his crotch?

7876
09:58:56,960 --> 09:58:59,960
Oh, look, it's like that fire giant destroyed.

7877
09:59:01,960 --> 09:59:03,960
Oh, sorry, I thought that was where to go.

7878
09:59:03,960 --> 09:59:05,960
I promise I'm not just being a weirdo.

7879
09:59:05,960 --> 09:59:07,960
I genuinely thought that was where I was supposed to go.

7880
09:59:08,960 --> 09:59:12,960
A furnace visage, which means fire face.

7881
09:59:12,960 --> 09:59:14,960
A visage just means face in French.

7882
09:59:25,960 --> 09:59:27,960
I can hear a few cries.

7883
09:59:27,960 --> 09:59:32,960
I don't know why they're crying though.

7884
09:59:32,960 --> 09:59:35,960
I'll give them something to cry about.

7885
09:59:36,960 --> 09:59:38,960
Something's attacking me.

7886
09:59:44,960 --> 09:59:46,960
Something's stomping about.

7887
09:59:50,960 --> 09:59:53,960
And a cave? Oh, is it dragons up there that are fighting?

7888
09:59:57,960 --> 09:59:59,960
Oh!

7889
10:00:01,960 --> 10:00:03,960
What was that?

7890
10:00:08,960 --> 10:00:10,960
I don't know what that was.

7891
10:00:12,960 --> 10:00:16,960
Sorry, I got such afraid. I'm sorry if I scared anyone in that.

7892
10:00:16,960 --> 10:00:28,960
There's savings like that building?

7893
10:00:35,960 --> 10:00:37,960
I will give you something to cry about.

7894
10:00:37,960 --> 10:00:39,960
It's just like my mama.

7895
10:00:40,960 --> 10:00:42,960
Oh, there's another...

7896
10:00:43,960 --> 10:00:45,960
Give me that. Fuck out of this area.

7897
10:00:45,960 --> 10:00:47,960
How'd I get out? I'll just go straight down.

7898
10:00:47,960 --> 10:00:48,960
Bye!

7899
10:00:48,960 --> 10:00:51,960
It was lovely visiting. No, really, it was.

7900
10:00:51,960 --> 10:00:53,960
I had a fantastic time.

7901
10:00:53,960 --> 10:00:57,960
It was gorgeous. Scenery 10 out of 10 would recommend for a tourist spot.

7902
10:00:57,960 --> 10:00:59,960
Do not mind at all.

7903
10:00:59,960 --> 10:01:02,960
You were literally submerged in water.

7904
10:01:02,960 --> 10:01:03,960
You're not telling me.

7905
10:01:03,960 --> 10:01:08,960
You're like Charimander, sorry, but as soon as you're retail, doesn't it work?

7906
10:01:08,960 --> 10:01:10,960
You know, your clogs are popped.

7907
10:01:10,960 --> 10:01:13,960
I didn't make the rules, mate. I didn't make the rules.

7908
10:01:18,960 --> 10:01:20,960
I still can't summon you guys.

7909
10:01:23,960 --> 10:01:25,960
Me when I can't follow you.

7910
10:01:26,960 --> 10:01:30,960
And so that Ryan Gosling meme where he's got his like hand or fist or whatever.

7911
10:01:32,960 --> 10:01:36,960
And then put my wee hair on it and just feel like when...

7912
10:01:36,960 --> 10:01:41,960
...Strony can't spawn in the reefing to carry her through every single game ever.

7913
10:01:42,960 --> 10:01:44,960
Through every single game she ever plays.

7914
10:01:46,960 --> 10:01:48,960
Where are you from, okay?

7915
10:01:52,960 --> 10:01:53,960
Yeah.

7916
10:01:54,960 --> 10:01:56,960
I'm sort of a weird, creepy boo.

7917
10:01:58,960 --> 10:02:00,960
Come on. Am I just exploring the reefing?

7918
10:02:00,960 --> 10:02:03,960
What am I doing? I don't actually know if I'm achieving anything.

7919
10:02:03,960 --> 10:02:05,960
I'm mucking around here.

7920
10:02:07,960 --> 10:02:08,960
What the?

7921
10:02:10,960 --> 10:02:13,960
Mercy when she plays a fucking third-person game.

7922
10:02:13,960 --> 10:02:15,960
Right, she was such a good spot. Holy crap.

7923
10:02:15,960 --> 10:02:17,960
I'm glad she wasn't sick though.

7924
10:02:17,960 --> 10:02:21,960
If you didn't know, I played an untitled duck game.

7925
10:02:22,960 --> 10:02:24,960
A goose game with a mercy.

7926
10:02:25,960 --> 10:02:31,960
But she has severe motion sickness and the camera angle would not stop twisting.

7927
10:02:31,960 --> 10:02:32,960
It was such a shame.

7928
10:02:32,960 --> 10:02:34,960
We almost finished it.

7929
10:02:34,960 --> 10:02:39,960
But she did this burp and you could tell it was an ono kind of burp.

7930
10:02:42,960 --> 10:02:44,960
That was definitely an ono.

7931
10:02:46,960 --> 10:02:51,960
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit, sit, sit, sit.

7932
10:02:51,960 --> 10:02:53,960
I'm getting fucking...

7933
10:02:53,960 --> 10:02:56,960
I'm actually gonna die. I'm ironically gonna die.

7934
10:02:56,960 --> 10:02:58,960
Why can I not sit down?

7935
10:02:58,960 --> 10:03:01,960
Because there's fucking enemy... I'm actually gonna die.

7936
10:03:03,960 --> 10:03:06,960
I'm actually gonna die because I'm so bad at this game.

7937
10:03:06,960 --> 10:03:07,960
Sit down.

7938
10:03:07,960 --> 10:03:09,960
You have to be kidding me.

7939
10:03:10,960 --> 10:03:12,960
Oh my god.

7940
10:03:14,960 --> 10:03:16,960
Don't ever.

7941
10:03:17,960 --> 10:03:19,960
Right, what we're doing here?

7942
10:03:19,960 --> 10:03:23,960
I don't know what we're doing here, but I'm just happy you guys can come.

7943
10:03:23,960 --> 10:03:24,960
Oh my god.

7944
10:03:24,960 --> 10:03:27,960
I'm already sitting, literally.

7945
10:03:27,960 --> 10:03:32,960
Sean is gonna be at the store and get into an awkward position and try to summon some reflin to help her.

7946
10:03:32,960 --> 10:03:36,960
I'm actually not that awkward in person.

7947
10:03:39,960 --> 10:03:43,960
So because I have an accent, people actually strike up a lot of caught...

7948
10:03:43,960 --> 10:03:45,960
Wait, is this a reflin?

7949
10:03:45,960 --> 10:03:46,960
That was a reflin, right?

7950
10:03:46,960 --> 10:03:47,960
It wasn't an MPC.

7951
10:03:48,960 --> 10:03:52,960
Sorry, we're at a place called Reclusus River Dunstrin.

7952
10:03:53,960 --> 10:03:55,960
Oh there you guys are.

7953
10:03:55,960 --> 10:03:57,960
Who hasn't been in...

7954
10:03:57,960 --> 10:04:00,960
Yeah, you've only recently came on, I think.

7955
10:04:01,960 --> 10:04:02,960
I'm not sure.

7956
10:04:02,960 --> 10:04:03,960
I'm so sorry.

7957
10:04:03,960 --> 10:04:04,960
Again, I'm sorry.

7958
10:04:05,960 --> 10:04:06,960
I've had naysleep.

7959
10:04:06,960 --> 10:04:07,960
I've had about what?

7960
10:04:09,960 --> 10:04:11,960
Five hours of sleep?

7961
10:04:11,960 --> 10:04:13,960
No, not even five hours.

7962
10:04:15,960 --> 10:04:19,960
I'm being a cheeky cheekerton, doing back-to-back Elden Ring because I want to.

7963
10:04:20,960 --> 10:04:21,960
Like, I wasn't...

7964
10:04:21,960 --> 10:04:23,960
Yesterday, I was like...

7965
10:04:23,960 --> 10:04:25,960
I don't feel stressed when I stream.

7966
10:04:25,960 --> 10:04:26,960
I feel so happy.

7967
10:04:26,960 --> 10:04:28,960
I don't have to worry.

7968
10:04:28,960 --> 10:04:30,960
Or anything.

7969
10:04:30,960 --> 10:04:31,960
Or on stream.

7970
10:04:31,960 --> 10:04:33,960
As soon as I click offline, it's like...

7971
10:04:33,960 --> 10:04:35,960
Oh my god.

7972
10:04:35,960 --> 10:04:37,960
Is there any enemy reflin?

7973
10:04:37,960 --> 10:04:38,960
Oh sorry.

7974
10:04:38,960 --> 10:04:40,960
Obviously better tonight.

7975
10:04:40,960 --> 10:04:47,960
I suspect I am most likely gonna do what's called a crash.

7976
10:04:47,960 --> 10:04:49,960
And I'm gonna get all my flops in.

7977
10:04:50,960 --> 10:04:52,960
Oh, can I not get an enemy reflin here?

7978
10:04:52,960 --> 10:04:53,960
Oh, I can, I can.

7979
10:04:53,960 --> 10:04:54,960
I heard it, I heard it.

7980
10:04:54,960 --> 10:04:55,960
Who's not been in...

7981
10:04:55,960 --> 10:04:57,960
Norm, I think...

7982
10:04:57,960 --> 10:04:59,960
Is it Norm?

7983
10:05:01,960 --> 10:05:03,960
Oh no, I can't remember.

7984
10:05:03,960 --> 10:05:06,960
Norm, did I have you in recent life?

7985
10:05:06,960 --> 10:05:08,960
Oh, I can't remember.

7986
10:05:10,960 --> 10:05:12,960
I like the path in here.

7987
10:05:12,960 --> 10:05:15,960
It's fun that enemy reflin is most of the time the torch car.

7988
10:05:15,960 --> 10:05:17,960
It literally tells me where I go.

7989
10:05:17,960 --> 10:05:19,960
I'm happy when you stream.

7990
10:05:19,960 --> 10:05:20,960
Yeah, it feels good, man.

7991
10:05:20,960 --> 10:05:21,960
Five hours is no sleep.

7992
10:05:21,960 --> 10:05:23,960
I've been average 4.5.

7993
10:05:23,960 --> 10:05:26,960
That must be an insomnia diagnosis.

7994
10:05:26,960 --> 10:05:28,960
Because there's no way...

7995
10:05:28,960 --> 10:05:31,960
If you have insomnia diagnosis, that's different.

7996
10:05:31,960 --> 10:05:34,960
I normally have 10 hours sleep.

7997
10:05:34,960 --> 10:05:38,960
Unfortunately, I have not been getting that, but...

7998
10:05:38,960 --> 10:05:39,960
Let's just go.

7999
10:05:39,960 --> 10:05:41,960
Meh, weh, weh, weh.

8000
10:05:41,960 --> 10:05:42,960
Boo-hoo.

8001
10:05:42,960 --> 10:05:44,960
Can't get 10 hours sleep.

8002
10:05:44,960 --> 10:05:45,960
I'm fine.

8003
10:05:46,960 --> 10:05:47,960
Oh, wait, no.

8004
10:05:47,960 --> 10:05:50,960
I thought that was a reflin that just went flying there.

8005
10:05:53,960 --> 10:05:54,960
Okay.

8006
10:05:54,960 --> 10:05:55,960
Nice and slowly.

8007
10:05:55,960 --> 10:05:57,960
Easy does it now.

8008
10:05:57,960 --> 10:05:59,960
Easy does it.

8009
10:05:59,960 --> 10:06:01,960
No one's trying to be a hero.

8010
10:06:01,960 --> 10:06:03,960
We don't need a speedrun.

8011
10:06:03,960 --> 10:06:05,960
Nice and easy.

8012
10:06:10,960 --> 10:06:11,960
Nice and easy.

8013
10:06:11,960 --> 10:06:13,960
Hey, kiddies!

8014
10:06:13,960 --> 10:06:15,960
Man, mosquitoes.

8015
10:06:15,960 --> 10:06:18,960
I've never fricking had problems with mosquitoes.

8016
10:06:18,960 --> 10:06:22,960
Because there's no such thing as a mosquito in Scotland.

8017
10:06:22,960 --> 10:06:24,960
They don't even...

8018
10:06:24,960 --> 10:06:27,960
They can't handle the climate.

8019
10:06:27,960 --> 10:06:28,960
Alright, let's just move on.

8020
10:06:28,960 --> 10:06:30,960
This thing going fucks up.

8021
10:06:32,960 --> 10:06:34,960
I'm irresponsible sleepers,

8022
10:06:34,960 --> 10:06:37,960
so I usually get sick the most every night and weekend.

8023
10:06:37,960 --> 10:06:40,960
I'm so jealous of people that...

8024
10:06:41,960 --> 10:06:43,960
Oh, Jean, that lets them get by with two...

8025
10:06:43,960 --> 10:06:45,960
Oh, well, it's really bad for their health,

8026
10:06:45,960 --> 10:06:47,960
even if they don't feel it.

8027
10:06:49,960 --> 10:06:51,960
Dry leaf roll.

8028
10:06:51,960 --> 10:06:53,960
Oh, what does that look like?

8029
10:06:54,960 --> 10:06:57,960
I assume it's all going to be worse for me.

8030
10:06:58,960 --> 10:07:01,960
Oh, I'm going to look like Melinda.

8031
10:07:04,960 --> 10:07:07,960
Me, listening to the reflin spite in the background.

8032
10:07:10,960 --> 10:07:12,960
What got me?

8033
10:07:12,960 --> 10:07:15,960
Oh, these biggest slugs have so much HP.

8034
10:07:15,960 --> 10:07:16,960
Hold on.

8035
10:07:16,960 --> 10:07:17,960
Right, let's move on.

8036
10:07:17,960 --> 10:07:18,960
Sorry, let's move on.

8037
10:07:18,960 --> 10:07:19,960
Let's get out of here.

8038
10:07:19,960 --> 10:07:21,960
The slugs are too much.

8039
10:07:21,960 --> 10:07:22,960
The slugs are too much.

8040
10:07:22,960 --> 10:07:23,960
That's too much HP.

8041
10:07:25,960 --> 10:07:27,960
I'll change my weapon a second.

8042
10:07:28,960 --> 10:07:31,960
Oh, look like the oogie-boogie man.

8043
10:07:32,960 --> 10:07:33,960
Oh, I missed.

8044
10:07:34,960 --> 10:07:35,960
Wait, don't disappear, Mr. Beetle.

8045
10:07:35,960 --> 10:07:36,960
I need you.

8046
10:07:36,960 --> 10:07:37,960
Stop it.

8047
10:07:37,960 --> 10:07:38,960
I need you, Mr. Beetle.

8048
10:07:39,960 --> 10:07:41,960
Oh, I'm not that handy.

8049
10:07:42,960 --> 10:07:44,960
Oh, somber something.

8050
10:07:46,960 --> 10:07:47,960
Okay.

8051
10:07:47,960 --> 10:07:49,960
Once we're out of here, I'll change my outfit back,

8052
10:07:49,960 --> 10:07:53,960
because this is not quite what I'm looking for.

8053
10:07:53,960 --> 10:07:55,960
That looks pretty cool, though.

8054
10:07:56,960 --> 10:07:58,960
That looks exactly like one of them.

8055
10:08:02,960 --> 10:08:04,960
There's no such thing as a Miss Ketwin Scotland.

8056
10:08:04,960 --> 10:08:06,960
This reflin looks in Louisiana.

8057
10:08:06,960 --> 10:08:08,960
It's going to be bumped up on the list.

8058
10:08:08,960 --> 10:08:09,960
Of reflings to import?

8059
10:08:09,960 --> 10:08:11,960
That's hilarious.

8060
10:08:14,960 --> 10:08:17,960
I wonder if you've got enough bones to bump your sword to ten.

8061
10:08:17,960 --> 10:08:18,960
I probably could.

8062
10:08:18,960 --> 10:08:19,960
Oh, okay.

8063
10:08:19,960 --> 10:08:20,960
It's a boat.

8064
10:08:20,960 --> 10:08:21,960
Hold on.

8065
10:08:21,960 --> 10:08:22,960
Let me put my good stuff back on.

8066
10:08:24,960 --> 10:08:29,960
I was a lion's head with armor.

8067
10:08:29,960 --> 10:08:31,960
That scares me.

8068
10:08:32,960 --> 10:08:34,960
I don't know what's ahead.

8069
10:08:34,960 --> 10:08:35,960
You're freaking me out, right?

8070
10:08:35,960 --> 10:08:37,960
I'm doing a medium roll.

8071
10:08:37,960 --> 10:08:38,960
Let's go.

8072
10:08:38,960 --> 10:08:40,960
Oh, I can't get past her.

8073
10:08:40,960 --> 10:08:44,960
Okay, let's see what's behind door number one.

8074
10:08:44,960 --> 10:08:47,960
Okay, it's a crypt fight.

8075
10:08:47,960 --> 10:08:51,960
Okay, it's a skinny blood katana.

8076
10:08:51,960 --> 10:09:08,960
But when I'm on skinny blood katana, I do a tiddlywinker damage.

8077
10:09:15,960 --> 10:09:17,960
I do a wee tiddlywinkle.

8078
10:09:17,960 --> 10:09:21,960
Is that a button?

8079
10:09:24,960 --> 10:09:26,960
A fucking tiddlywink, honestly.

8080
10:09:26,960 --> 10:09:30,960
Right, I don't need fire resistance at the moment.

8081
10:09:30,960 --> 10:09:33,960
Just give me a stamina, I guess, one more.

8082
10:09:39,960 --> 10:09:41,960
There's a refling on standby.

8083
10:09:42,960 --> 10:09:47,960
I can't believe you would underestimate the skinny.

8084
10:09:47,960 --> 10:09:53,960
Honestly, I saw the long katana and I was like, okay, skinny bleed build, bruv.

8085
10:09:53,960 --> 10:09:58,960
They were not kidding when they were like, ah, by the way, this game's a wee bit harder.

8086
10:09:58,960 --> 10:10:01,960
Did I just have you both then?

8087
10:10:01,960 --> 10:10:02,960
Norm?

8088
10:10:05,960 --> 10:10:07,960
Look at me.

8089
10:10:08,960 --> 10:10:11,960
Sorry, I'm just going to push right now.

8090
10:10:11,960 --> 10:10:15,960
I hope the boss doesn't have poise, damn straight.

8091
10:10:15,960 --> 10:10:17,960
You better not.

8092
10:10:19,960 --> 10:10:21,960
Okay, here's the thunder.

8093
10:10:24,960 --> 10:10:26,960
Are you ready?

8094
10:10:26,960 --> 10:10:28,960
Are you steady?

8095
10:10:28,960 --> 10:10:29,960
Oh jeez.

8096
10:10:29,960 --> 10:10:30,960
Good luck.

8097
10:10:30,960 --> 10:10:34,960
See, that charm, that was actually me, that wasn't the thing.

8098
10:10:34,960 --> 10:10:38,960
Okay, let's try that again, the same as the apps again, bloateroo, the upgrade.

8099
10:10:40,960 --> 10:10:41,960
Hold on.

8100
10:10:42,960 --> 10:10:43,960
What's the plan?

8101
10:10:43,960 --> 10:10:44,960
What's the plan?

8102
10:10:44,960 --> 10:10:45,960
Abracadabra.

8103
10:10:45,960 --> 10:10:46,960
Swinging.

8104
10:10:46,960 --> 10:10:48,960
You're allowed to swing.

8105
10:10:48,960 --> 10:10:51,960
I'd rather you didn't, but that is the bit.

8106
10:10:52,960 --> 10:10:53,960
Poise.

8107
10:10:56,960 --> 10:10:58,960
Refling, no.

8108
10:11:00,960 --> 10:11:02,960
Okay, the poise is breakable.

8109
10:11:02,960 --> 10:11:05,960
I think we all need to go in heavy, but I'm out of fricking...

8110
10:11:07,960 --> 10:11:09,960
I'm out of stamina, holy crap.

8111
10:11:12,960 --> 10:11:15,960
I'm like completely out of stamina when I'm trying to...

8112
10:11:22,960 --> 10:11:23,960
Oh, at least.

8113
10:11:24,960 --> 10:11:25,960
Okay.

8114
10:11:25,960 --> 10:11:29,960
Hardly any poise, which is good, but I need to back off because I'm out.

8115
10:11:31,960 --> 10:11:33,960
I need to back off because I'm out.

8116
10:11:35,960 --> 10:11:38,960
I need to recover the stamina.

8117
10:11:42,960 --> 10:11:46,960
Alright, so when I slam down any other time, she gets close chance,

8118
10:11:46,960 --> 10:11:49,960
but when I do it that one time, she doesn't aim right, okay.

8119
10:11:49,960 --> 10:11:51,960
Better scratch her a minch and fucking take a sniff

8120
10:11:51,960 --> 10:11:54,960
because she's got bigger fish to fry than fucking me, hen.

8121
10:11:56,960 --> 10:11:57,960
Raging.

8122
10:11:57,960 --> 10:11:58,960
Actual raging.

8123
10:11:59,960 --> 10:12:02,960
I'm too tired to have my angry voice on me.

8124
10:12:03,960 --> 10:12:06,960
I'm too tired to have my angry voice on me.

8125
10:12:09,960 --> 10:12:11,960
Okay, are we got heavies?

8126
10:12:12,960 --> 10:12:14,960
Okay, I need you to back off.

8127
10:12:15,960 --> 10:12:17,960
Okay, are we got heavies?

8128
10:12:18,960 --> 10:12:20,960
Okay, I need you to be heavy.

8129
10:12:22,960 --> 10:12:25,960
That was a good try, though, now. Like, we're 100% gold.

8130
10:12:25,960 --> 10:12:27,960
I'm just fucking being straight, so...

8131
10:12:28,960 --> 10:12:31,960
We don't really have many cork brooches in most places in Scotland, either.

8132
10:12:33,960 --> 10:12:37,960
Yeah, I've never actually seen a cork brooch in Silicon to Australia.

8133
10:12:38,960 --> 10:12:39,960
Not fun.

8134
10:12:40,960 --> 10:12:43,960
That Scottish trash talk was actually kind of crazy.

8135
10:12:44,960 --> 10:12:47,960
Literally, she's got a badly packed kebab, fucking axe wound looking ass.

8136
10:12:47,960 --> 10:12:49,960
Honestly, it's trailing halfway out the door, hen.

8137
10:12:52,960 --> 10:12:55,960
If she jumps up and down, her fanny flaps clap.

8138
10:12:55,960 --> 10:12:57,960
Like, fuck off, honestly.

8139
10:13:00,960 --> 10:13:02,960
Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's do it again.

8140
10:13:02,960 --> 10:13:03,960
Let's do it.

8141
10:13:04,960 --> 10:13:05,960
Let's do it.

8142
10:13:10,960 --> 10:13:12,960
Alright, I have points. Fuck your points.

8143
10:13:12,960 --> 10:13:13,960
You're shit.

8144
10:13:13,960 --> 10:13:15,960
We're just fucking going for it.

8145
10:13:20,960 --> 10:13:21,960
No, I need...

8146
10:13:30,960 --> 10:13:34,960
And don't get me started about your family tree. It's a fucking circle, mate.

8147
10:13:35,960 --> 10:13:36,960
That doesn't make any sense.

8148
10:13:37,960 --> 10:13:38,960
Maybe it does.

8149
10:13:39,960 --> 10:13:40,960
No, wait.

8150
10:13:41,960 --> 10:13:43,960
Why is it your family tree looks like a...

8151
10:13:44,960 --> 10:13:46,960
Is it? Your family tree looks like a circle?

8152
10:13:47,960 --> 10:13:48,960
If it's all been...

8153
10:13:50,960 --> 10:13:52,960
Hey, that's what I meant. That's what I meant.

8154
10:13:53,960 --> 10:13:54,960
And...

8155
10:13:58,960 --> 10:13:59,960
And I'm...

8156
10:14:02,960 --> 10:14:05,960
Did I not just summon you, or am I getting memory loss now?

8157
10:14:06,960 --> 10:14:08,960
I think I'm starting to get memory loss.

8158
10:14:09,960 --> 10:14:11,960
Oh, your family tree is a fucking reef.

8159
10:14:11,960 --> 10:14:12,960
Ah, that's what it is.

8160
10:14:17,960 --> 10:14:18,960
Someone put some...

8161
10:14:23,960 --> 10:14:24,960
You're found.

8162
10:14:25,960 --> 10:14:26,960
I'm dead.

8163
10:14:31,960 --> 10:14:32,960
Alright, let's try it again.

8164
10:14:32,960 --> 10:14:34,960
Alright, how about we... We've got our own fucking...

8165
10:14:34,960 --> 10:14:36,960
Weakening Kitana, but we...

8166
10:14:36,960 --> 10:14:37,960
Like, don't you mind those?

8167
10:14:38,960 --> 10:14:39,960
Okay, you're blessing yourself.

8168
10:14:39,960 --> 10:14:40,960
That's fine. You're allowed to bless yourself.

8169
10:14:47,960 --> 10:14:48,960
Fuck you. No poise.

8170
10:14:48,960 --> 10:14:49,960
No talent.

8171
10:14:49,960 --> 10:14:50,960
No skill.

8172
10:14:50,960 --> 10:14:51,960
Shit.

8173
10:14:51,960 --> 10:14:52,960
Masterful blade.

8174
10:14:52,960 --> 10:14:53,960
Bastard.

8175
10:14:53,960 --> 10:14:54,960
Honestly.

8176
10:14:56,960 --> 10:14:57,960
No way!

8177
10:14:58,960 --> 10:15:01,960
Okay, I think I'm gonna try and upgrade this sword next.

8178
10:15:01,960 --> 10:15:02,960
Cause...

8179
10:15:02,960 --> 10:15:04,960
I think I have what I need for it.

8180
10:15:07,960 --> 10:15:08,960
Oh my god, I'll...

8181
10:15:10,960 --> 10:15:12,960
I literally cannot be hit twice.

8182
10:15:12,960 --> 10:15:13,960
That's insane.

8183
10:15:22,960 --> 10:15:25,960
I literally cannot be hit twice in a row, or I'm gone.

8184
10:15:27,960 --> 10:15:29,960
No way she has heals!

8185
10:15:29,960 --> 10:15:31,960
That's against the fucking rules!

8186
10:15:35,960 --> 10:15:37,960
Alright, I need back walls on boots.

8187
10:15:42,960 --> 10:15:43,960
Okay, hold on.

8188
10:15:47,960 --> 10:15:49,960
Fucking get cornered, honestly.

8189
10:15:50,960 --> 10:15:51,960
Ah!

8190
10:15:56,960 --> 10:15:58,960
Ah, as if she's healing.

8191
10:15:59,960 --> 10:16:01,960
Is that even a heal, you really?

8192
10:16:04,960 --> 10:16:06,960
Ah, I'm out of stamina. I'm gone.

8193
10:16:06,960 --> 10:16:08,960
I don't even think I can dodge.

8194
10:16:09,960 --> 10:16:12,960
I can hardly even dodge to heal!

8195
10:16:13,960 --> 10:16:14,960
Fuck me, man.

8196
10:16:16,960 --> 10:16:18,960
I need to heal!

8197
10:16:19,960 --> 10:16:20,960
I need to heal!

8198
10:16:25,960 --> 10:16:27,960
So when I jump, she hit...

8199
10:16:27,960 --> 10:16:30,960
Oh, cause she's bloody faster than me by a pixel.

8200
10:16:41,960 --> 10:16:42,960
Good news.

8201
10:16:43,960 --> 10:16:46,960
Strongly, my sister is pregnant. I'm gonna be the father.

8202
10:16:50,960 --> 10:16:52,960
No, no, you're not supposed to do that part.

8203
10:16:52,960 --> 10:16:54,960
That part isn't supposed to happen.

8204
10:16:56,960 --> 10:16:58,960
He cleaned us up with an ash of war.

8205
10:16:59,960 --> 10:17:03,960
When he does the stomp, he goes into super armor and can't be staggered.

8206
10:17:03,960 --> 10:17:04,960
Is that what it is?

8207
10:17:05,960 --> 10:17:07,960
You've not had a shot.

8208
10:17:08,960 --> 10:17:10,960
I placed my Sane, but I don't know...

8209
10:17:10,960 --> 10:17:12,960
I don't even think it's a Sane.

8210
10:17:13,960 --> 10:17:16,960
Have you had a shot? If you've not had a shot, I think...

8211
10:17:16,960 --> 10:17:18,960
Okay, these guys have had a shot.

8212
10:17:19,960 --> 10:17:22,960
I know we can do it like sauce. We can like a hundred percent do this.

8213
10:17:22,960 --> 10:17:25,960
Are you telling me like we can take down like incredibly massive bosses

8214
10:17:25,960 --> 10:17:29,960
and this wee skinny rat sitting in a fucking cat comb,

8215
10:17:29,960 --> 10:17:34,960
like a somewhat weird and festive little scurry and about.

8216
10:17:34,960 --> 10:17:37,960
We can't deal with that. No, sorry, I don't believe it.

8217
10:17:37,960 --> 10:17:38,960
I don't believe it.

8218
10:17:39,960 --> 10:17:40,960
I didn't believe it.

8219
10:17:44,960 --> 10:17:45,960
Let's try again.

8220
10:17:46,960 --> 10:17:48,960
I just have had more infinite stamina.

8221
10:17:48,960 --> 10:17:50,960
Honestly, I'm like, if I shove it all in your...

8222
10:17:50,960 --> 10:17:52,960
Do you use the light snows? Okay, we've been blessed.

8223
10:17:58,960 --> 10:18:00,960
Mate, you... fuck you.

8224
10:18:00,960 --> 10:18:01,960
I missed.

8225
10:18:04,960 --> 10:18:06,960
I missed horribly wrong.

8226
10:18:06,960 --> 10:18:08,960
I'm actually really wrong.

8227
10:18:14,960 --> 10:18:17,960
Careful of whatever her freaking Ash of War is,

8228
10:18:17,960 --> 10:18:20,960
so don't all get too close or else we're all gonna get walloped.

8229
10:18:20,960 --> 10:18:23,960
Oh, that was a good one. I like that. Do that again.

8230
10:18:33,960 --> 10:18:35,960
I'm actually gonna still heal because I don't trust it.

8231
10:18:36,960 --> 10:18:38,960
How does that man...

8232
10:18:38,960 --> 10:18:42,960
Holy shit, I don't know what you're doing, but yeah, damn.

8233
10:18:45,960 --> 10:18:47,960
I'm gonna make sure I'm full health because I do not trust.

8234
10:18:52,960 --> 10:18:54,960
Neatly...

8235
10:18:54,960 --> 10:18:55,960
I don't know about stamina.

8236
10:19:06,960 --> 10:19:07,960
I don't know.

8237
10:19:23,960 --> 10:19:26,960
Sorry, I'm very low stamina. I'm trying.

8238
10:19:28,960 --> 10:19:31,960
Fucking not regenerating because I'm jumping about the place.

8239
10:19:31,960 --> 10:19:33,960
Like a kangaroo.

8240
10:19:33,960 --> 10:19:36,960
Oh, that was bloody good timing that.

8241
10:19:38,960 --> 10:19:40,960
I'm worried about her sword art. I don't know when she does it.

8242
10:19:40,960 --> 10:19:42,960
Like, I'm getting nervous.

8243
10:19:43,960 --> 10:19:46,960
Oh my god, you're like fucking nothing at all about the thing.

8244
10:19:46,960 --> 10:19:48,960
That's actually kind of funny.

8245
10:19:48,960 --> 10:19:51,960
She's like just trying to get one looking.

8246
10:19:51,960 --> 10:19:53,960
I hope I make back off the wall.

8247
10:19:53,960 --> 10:20:06,960
Okay, she's out of heals. She's just showing us she's out of heals.

8248
10:20:12,960 --> 10:20:14,960
I don't know how I did that one, but I'll take it.

8249
10:20:14,960 --> 10:20:15,960
I'm young.

8250
10:20:23,960 --> 10:20:24,960
Nice.

8251
10:20:37,960 --> 10:20:41,960
Okay, I need to back off the wall because it's not gonna fucking hit if I'm against the wall.

8252
10:20:41,960 --> 10:20:45,960
That candlestick is unironically the candlestick is in the way.

8253
10:20:47,960 --> 10:20:51,960
Dude, I was gonna jump and attack, but who's gonna win?

8254
10:20:51,960 --> 10:20:53,960
Oh, I knew we could do it.

8255
10:20:55,960 --> 10:20:56,960
Thank you.

8256
10:21:00,960 --> 10:21:02,960
Did we even get anything to that?

8257
10:21:04,960 --> 10:21:07,960
Oh, we got armor. Holy crap. What kind of armor?

8258
10:21:08,960 --> 10:21:09,960
Check it out.

8259
10:21:10,960 --> 10:21:11,960
Shit.

8260
10:21:15,960 --> 10:21:19,960
Is it like a lay armor? It must be samurai armor, I guess.

8261
10:21:22,960 --> 10:21:24,960
I mean, I guess.

8262
10:21:25,960 --> 10:21:29,960
You took two turns to smash her? Yeah.

8263
10:21:30,960 --> 10:21:33,960
See, Kenneth is like actually mildly fair.

8264
10:21:33,960 --> 10:21:36,960
Then it's like, yeah, I'll put my time until like actually dodging and shit.

8265
10:21:36,960 --> 10:21:43,960
But Ken, when it's just like, or you need to like hack a billion diamonds, it's like, bro, you only got time for that.

8266
10:21:43,960 --> 10:21:44,960
Oh, okay.

8267
10:21:49,960 --> 10:21:51,960
I'm literally getting the more benefit than this.

8268
10:21:51,960 --> 10:21:53,960
Right, so we're done.

8269
10:21:54,960 --> 10:21:57,960
Is there more? No, wait, there's a giant out there.

8270
10:22:01,960 --> 10:22:04,960
Oh no, I have eye strain in my left eye. Are you kidding me?

8271
10:22:07,960 --> 10:22:09,960
Sorry, I'm looking around right now.

8272
10:22:09,960 --> 10:22:11,960
I have left strain in my left eye for some-

8273
10:22:11,960 --> 10:22:14,960
It left strain. I have eye strain in my left eye for something.

8274
10:22:15,960 --> 10:22:17,960
Are you joking me? Come on.

8275
10:22:17,960 --> 10:22:20,960
Where is it? Where are they? Oh, come on. We've only got one fucking hour left.

8276
10:22:20,960 --> 10:22:22,960
I'm just gonna relax.

8277
10:22:22,960 --> 10:22:24,960
I need to put a little plaster on my eye.

8278
10:22:25,960 --> 10:22:26,960
I need to do a mercy. Hold on.

8279
10:22:36,960 --> 10:22:38,960
When you soap the boss like that, it's kind of hot.

8280
10:22:39,960 --> 10:22:40,960
Okay, angry.

8281
10:22:46,960 --> 10:22:48,960
Oh, I just got all of them.

8282
10:22:49,960 --> 10:22:52,960
Right, so that was something.

8283
10:22:53,960 --> 10:22:55,960
Where else did you check in?

8284
10:22:57,960 --> 10:22:59,960
Okay, that was that, but I couldn't summon you guys in.

8285
10:22:59,960 --> 10:23:07,960
I assume if I summon you in here, there's no way the game's gonna let his wolf all the way to that giant to try and get the giant?

8286
10:23:24,960 --> 10:23:26,960
You ever wish you could like fake angry?

8287
10:23:26,960 --> 10:23:29,960
I feel like there's a word for it too, but I'm too interested in-

8288
10:23:33,960 --> 10:23:35,960
Like be an actual angry person?

8289
10:23:39,960 --> 10:23:42,960
I think it's just within your personality, I guess.

8290
10:23:45,960 --> 10:23:53,960
I always grew up like, you know, you're polite, you're quiet, you keep to yourself, like that kind of thing.

8291
10:23:53,960 --> 10:23:56,960
Can't summon us anywhere near there.

8292
10:23:56,960 --> 10:23:59,960
Oh, bro, why would they give such a big fight then?

8293
10:24:00,960 --> 10:24:01,960
The game's so rude, right?

8294
10:24:01,960 --> 10:24:06,960
I'm just gonna go here and then take my- oh no, the horse doesn't go up there, it in.

8295
10:24:11,960 --> 10:24:13,960
The best I can do is the water.

8296
10:24:14,960 --> 10:24:17,960
No, it's kind of- I think I'm stuck.

8297
10:24:18,960 --> 10:24:20,960
Recruits?

8298
10:24:21,960 --> 10:24:23,960
River downstream grade.

8299
10:24:24,960 --> 10:24:26,960
Someone take her behind the cat.

8300
10:24:28,960 --> 10:24:32,960
Well, act angry if they're actually being angry to get whole angry thoughts in.

8301
10:24:32,960 --> 10:24:33,960
Oh!

8302
10:24:34,960 --> 10:24:35,960
Act in it, yeah.

8303
10:24:36,960 --> 10:24:38,960
She says it's her voice size.

8304
10:24:39,960 --> 10:24:44,960
Um, yeah, like, no, I can like, if you want to give me a sentence, I'll try my best to say it.

8305
10:24:44,960 --> 10:24:49,960
I might be cringe because I'm exhausted right now, but yeah, I can definitely act angry.

8306
10:24:49,960 --> 10:24:51,960
Like, oh, I'm fucking reasonable.

8307
10:24:51,960 --> 10:24:59,960
It sounds so sarcastic because, like, it's not me saying it right now, but you know.

8308
10:24:59,960 --> 10:25:03,960
If you want to take the map, you have to go to the ruins of the North.

8309
10:25:09,960 --> 10:25:14,960
I'm taking what holds the benefit of low-energy angry mummy.

8310
10:25:14,960 --> 10:25:16,960
I'm at your region.

8311
10:25:17,960 --> 10:25:19,960
You will be looking after yourself.

8312
10:25:20,960 --> 10:25:25,960
I'm not even at the point of anger where I'm shouting at you, Reefling.

8313
10:25:25,960 --> 10:25:33,960
I'm at the point of disappointed anger where I have told you over and over again to look after yourself.

8314
10:25:33,960 --> 10:25:41,960
And yet, you keep coming back to me and you keep explaining to me that you don't feel well and something's not working out.

8315
10:25:41,960 --> 10:25:45,960
Like, that's probably emotionless as a tag for a reason.

8316
10:25:45,960 --> 10:25:48,960
Oh, I can definitely do emotionless right now, so I'm exhausted.

8317
10:25:48,960 --> 10:25:49,960
Sorry.

8318
10:25:49,960 --> 10:25:52,960
There's a boss in Six Sacred Fragments behind the castle.

8319
10:25:52,960 --> 10:25:54,960
This castle?

8320
10:25:54,960 --> 10:25:55,960
No, that's a room.

8321
10:25:56,960 --> 10:25:58,960
The shadowy castle?

8322
10:26:04,960 --> 10:26:05,960
Mmm.

8323
10:26:08,960 --> 10:26:11,960
Yeah, probably do emotionless right now.

8324
10:26:11,960 --> 10:26:14,960
Having someone disappointed at you is so much worse than just being angry.

8325
10:26:14,960 --> 10:26:16,960
Bro, tell me about it.

8326
10:26:16,960 --> 10:26:26,960
When I started my job at my cafe, I accidentally left a bin's out, but I didn't close them.

8327
10:26:26,960 --> 10:26:31,960
And Seagull's fucking ripped the bag open in the back door.

8328
10:26:32,960 --> 10:26:35,960
And my boss was like, strongy.

8329
10:26:35,960 --> 10:26:36,960
I'm not mad.

8330
10:26:36,960 --> 10:26:39,960
I'm just disappointed because you knew better.

8331
10:26:39,960 --> 10:26:41,960
And I was like, I'm so sorry.

8332
10:26:41,960 --> 10:26:43,960
Like, I completely forgot.

8333
10:26:43,960 --> 10:26:46,960
Somehow disappointed anger is way worse.

8334
10:26:46,960 --> 10:26:50,960
I thought I'd try my best to take you back to yourself, but when you're disappointed in me...

8335
10:26:52,960 --> 10:26:54,960
When she's not angry, she's disappointed.

8336
10:26:54,960 --> 10:26:55,960
Yeah, shadow keep.

8337
10:26:55,960 --> 10:26:57,960
There's a wall in the store room you can go through.

8338
10:26:57,960 --> 10:26:59,960
Shadow keep.

8339
10:26:59,960 --> 10:27:01,960
Shhh, shhh, shhh, shadow keep.

8340
10:27:01,960 --> 10:27:05,960
There's a wall in the store room you can go through.

8341
10:27:05,960 --> 10:27:08,960
Maybe for score, high, high, high, high, high, high, high.

8342
10:27:09,960 --> 10:27:11,960
Strongy, you just perfectly imitated my mom.

8343
10:27:11,960 --> 10:27:12,960
That was funny.

8344
10:27:12,960 --> 10:27:13,960
It's probably uncomfortable.

8345
10:27:14,960 --> 10:27:15,960
Hello, strongy.

8346
10:27:15,960 --> 10:27:16,960
Hello, cha.

8347
10:27:16,960 --> 10:27:17,960
Hello.

8348
10:27:17,960 --> 10:27:18,960
How's it going?

8349
10:27:19,960 --> 10:27:20,960
I'm very low energy.

8350
10:27:20,960 --> 10:27:24,960
We're just talking about how I can be like a scorny mother, basically.

8351
10:27:24,960 --> 10:27:28,960
But instead of being angry because I'm like low energy,

8352
10:27:28,960 --> 10:27:31,960
I just sound like a disappointed mum.

8353
10:27:31,960 --> 10:27:33,960
So how's force floor?

8354
10:27:33,960 --> 10:27:35,960
I would guide you, but I'm not.

8355
10:27:35,960 --> 10:27:36,960
Oh, I'm no home right now.

8356
10:27:36,960 --> 10:27:39,960
Oh, does anyone know what he wants me to do?

8357
10:27:42,960 --> 10:27:47,960
Maybe if we do some exploring, we'll find a way.

8358
10:27:48,960 --> 10:27:52,960
If you want to go out to get that boss, you need to go to the sun center.

8359
10:27:53,960 --> 10:27:55,960
I'll sink your church.

8360
10:27:56,960 --> 10:27:57,960
I'll be your church.

8361
10:27:57,960 --> 10:27:59,960
You can sink in my church.

8362
10:28:01,960 --> 10:28:05,960
If you want to go to that boss, you need to go to the sun center.

8363
10:28:05,960 --> 10:28:06,960
Wait, this one?

8364
10:28:06,960 --> 10:28:07,960
No, wait.

8365
10:28:07,960 --> 10:28:08,960
The ruins of...

8366
10:28:12,960 --> 10:28:13,960
I know, I'm sorry.

8367
10:28:13,960 --> 10:28:15,960
Or is this the sun center?

8368
10:28:15,960 --> 10:28:17,960
Or is this the red...

8369
10:28:17,960 --> 10:28:20,960
No, this is a fucking castle.

8370
10:28:27,960 --> 10:28:33,960
Shadooke, shadooke, shadooke, there's a shadooke,

8371
10:28:33,960 --> 10:28:39,960
There's a shadooke, shadooke, shadooke, shadooke, shadooke.

8372
10:28:39,960 --> 10:28:41,960
Shadooke Mingi.

8373
10:28:41,960 --> 10:28:50,960
Actually, would seagulls be considered our enemies or natural enemies because we're calamari?

8374
10:28:50,960 --> 10:28:52,960
Thank you.

8375
10:28:52,960 --> 10:29:01,960
Oh, is this one of them boxed with things where I kind of call you then?

8376
10:29:01,960 --> 10:29:11,960
Was it this way?

8377
10:29:11,960 --> 10:29:16,960
If I'm getting it wrong.

8378
10:29:16,960 --> 10:29:18,960
Bruh!

8379
10:29:18,960 --> 10:29:23,960
Imma wait for my reference for a freaking millisecond, please!

8380
10:29:23,960 --> 10:29:26,960
Have some mercy!

8381
10:29:27,960 --> 10:29:33,960
Go to church district entry gate.

8382
10:29:40,960 --> 10:29:43,960
I'm so sorry, I don't know this.

8383
10:29:43,960 --> 10:29:45,960
I can't believe it.

8384
10:29:45,960 --> 10:29:54,960
Go to church district entry gate.

8385
10:29:54,960 --> 10:29:58,960
Right, I'm fucking doing a complete wrong place.

8386
10:29:58,960 --> 10:30:02,960
See, this is what you have to put up with when you're a streamer.

8387
10:30:02,960 --> 10:30:07,960
Church district high road.

8388
10:30:07,960 --> 10:30:11,960
Church district entrance.

8389
10:30:11,960 --> 10:30:13,960
Sunken chapel.

8390
10:30:13,960 --> 10:30:16,960
Do you want me in the end?

8391
10:30:16,960 --> 10:30:19,960
I'm so sorry, I'm absolutely losing the floor.

8392
10:30:19,960 --> 10:30:22,960
I'm sure I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll be completely on board.

8393
10:30:22,960 --> 10:30:24,960
Exactly what to do for right now.

8394
10:30:24,960 --> 10:30:27,960
Oh, you want me to go to sunken chapel?

8395
10:30:27,960 --> 10:30:28,960
Sorry.

8396
10:30:28,960 --> 10:30:29,960
Sorry?

8397
10:30:29,960 --> 10:30:32,960
No, what are we doing in sunken chapel?

8398
10:30:32,960 --> 10:30:34,960
What will we do with sunken chapel?

8399
10:30:34,960 --> 10:30:36,960
What will we do with the sunken chapel?

8400
10:30:36,960 --> 10:30:40,960
What will we do with the sunken chapel early in the morning?

8401
10:30:40,960 --> 10:30:44,960
He won up, he rises, he won up.

8402
10:30:44,960 --> 10:30:47,960
I swear to God if you say I can't spawn anyone in.

8403
10:30:47,960 --> 10:30:51,960
Imma ask for a refund at it and I'm not actually.

8404
10:30:51,960 --> 10:30:53,960
I'll just be a big girl.

8405
10:30:53,960 --> 10:30:55,960
Oh, and you can upgrade my sword as well actually.

8406
10:30:55,960 --> 10:30:58,960
I need to thanks you for saving me.

8407
10:30:58,960 --> 10:31:01,960
Alright, now that I'm here.

8408
10:31:01,960 --> 10:31:05,960
There's some sort of exit.

8409
10:31:05,960 --> 10:31:07,960
Is it?

8410
10:31:07,960 --> 10:31:09,960
What is this?

8411
10:31:09,960 --> 10:31:11,960
I don't know what this is.

8412
10:31:11,960 --> 10:31:20,960
Wait, there's a fucking summoning thing.

8413
10:31:20,960 --> 10:31:30,960
Strony, when you're in the, if you press Y, you bring up the list of the...

8414
10:31:30,960 --> 10:31:36,960
Oh my God, that's a good spot.

8415
10:31:36,960 --> 10:31:38,960
What am I doing here?

8416
10:31:38,960 --> 10:31:42,960
I don't know.

8417
10:31:42,960 --> 10:31:49,960
Can you switch that?

8418
10:31:49,960 --> 10:31:51,960
How many DLC both of you?

8419
10:31:51,960 --> 10:31:54,960
Have you perished too far too many?

8420
10:31:54,960 --> 10:31:58,960
I'm absolutely terrified when the reflins can't help me.

8421
10:31:58,960 --> 10:32:01,960
Come on, you have to tell me there's like an enemy in here.

8422
10:32:01,960 --> 10:32:05,960
There's no way.

8423
10:32:05,960 --> 10:32:07,960
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

8424
10:32:07,960 --> 10:32:09,960
No, I don't have my reflins.

8425
10:32:09,960 --> 10:32:11,960
No.

8426
10:32:11,960 --> 10:32:12,960
Should I just grab the items?

8427
10:32:12,960 --> 10:32:14,960
You know, I'm just grabbing the items.

8428
10:32:14,960 --> 10:32:15,960
No, no, no, no.

8429
10:32:15,960 --> 10:32:17,960
Can I even grab the items?

8430
10:32:17,960 --> 10:32:25,960
I can't even grab the room! I'm pillaging the remains! Any pillagers! I'm a pillager! I'm pillaging for sombers with worms!

8431
10:32:25,960 --> 10:32:28,960
Oh, there's two psalms. Get me out of here.

8432
10:32:28,960 --> 10:32:32,960
He's too big to fit through these doors. Close the doors. Close the doors behind me.

8433
10:32:32,960 --> 10:32:34,960
Ring the guards. Ring the guards.

8434
10:32:34,960 --> 10:32:36,960
Fuck me. Is there enemy?

8435
10:32:36,960 --> 10:32:41,960
Oh, fuck me! It gets worse! It gets worse! It gets worse! It gets worse!

8436
10:32:41,960 --> 10:32:45,960
When the reeflings aren't around, it gets even worse!

8437
10:32:46,960 --> 10:32:47,960
Okay.

8438
10:32:47,960 --> 10:32:50,960
You should seek to find a safe location.

8439
10:32:53,960 --> 10:32:54,960
Safe.

8440
10:32:54,960 --> 10:32:55,960
Safe?

8441
10:32:56,960 --> 10:32:58,960
Do these doors safe?

8442
10:33:01,960 --> 10:33:05,960
Okay, safe enough. I can just hide here. Right. What am I doing?

8443
10:33:06,960 --> 10:33:10,960
In the building with the flaming zombies, there's an elevator if you hug the right.

8444
10:33:10,960 --> 10:33:11,960
This?

8445
10:33:11,960 --> 10:33:13,960
Did I find it suspiciously?

8446
10:33:13,960 --> 10:33:15,960
Did I find it by accident?

8447
10:33:17,960 --> 10:33:19,960
I think I found it by accident.

8448
10:33:19,960 --> 10:33:22,960
No, that's not it. Okay, my apologies.

8449
10:33:24,960 --> 10:33:27,960
Wrong one. It was a 50-50.

8450
10:33:34,960 --> 10:33:35,960
Woah.

8451
10:33:36,960 --> 10:33:38,960
I'm so brave. I can do it.

8452
10:33:38,960 --> 10:33:43,960
Just go dead ahead. Surely just dead ahead and I don't have to think.

8453
10:33:43,960 --> 10:33:45,960
I don't have to say anyone.

8454
10:33:46,960 --> 10:33:48,960
Excuse me, pardon me, come through.

8455
10:33:48,960 --> 10:33:50,960
Excuse me, pardon me, come through!

8456
10:33:52,960 --> 10:33:55,960
Hug the right? You're not the right. Hug the right?

8457
10:33:55,960 --> 10:33:57,960
You're a statue. Hug the right?

8458
10:33:57,960 --> 10:34:00,960
Wait, what the heck? Why are you doing it like that?

8459
10:34:01,960 --> 10:34:03,960
Hug the right?

8460
10:34:05,960 --> 10:34:07,960
If you go past them and then to your left.

8461
10:34:09,960 --> 10:34:12,960
And then there's an elevator to the right.

8462
10:34:29,960 --> 10:34:31,960
You're right! Oh my god.

8463
10:34:31,960 --> 10:34:33,960
Oh my god.

8464
10:34:35,960 --> 10:34:38,960
Safety, safety. We go there in the end.

8465
10:34:42,960 --> 10:34:44,960
Motherfucker.

8466
10:34:52,960 --> 10:34:53,960
Fuck!

8467
10:34:54,960 --> 10:34:56,960
Fuck! I'm actually gonna have to do a fight?

8468
10:34:56,960 --> 10:34:58,960
Or can I just, like...

8469
10:34:59,960 --> 10:35:02,960
Can I just run ahead and there's like a thing or something?

8470
10:35:18,960 --> 10:35:20,960
Just keep running.

8471
10:35:20,960 --> 10:35:22,960
No button.

8472
10:35:22,960 --> 10:35:24,960
Shh, shh, shh.

8473
10:35:27,960 --> 10:35:31,960
If I make a break for that. No, there's an empty wall. There's no jump.

8474
10:35:31,960 --> 10:35:33,960
There's no fucking jump.

8475
10:35:34,960 --> 10:35:36,960
You went too far.

8476
10:35:38,960 --> 10:35:40,960
Shh.

8477
10:35:42,960 --> 10:35:44,960
There is a red enemy back there.

8478
10:35:45,960 --> 10:35:47,960
I can handle it. I can handle it.

8479
10:35:52,960 --> 10:35:54,960
Fuck.

8480
10:36:12,960 --> 10:36:14,960
I hate gaming on my own.

8481
10:36:14,960 --> 10:36:16,960
Oh my god, I can't do it. Holy shit.

8482
10:36:16,960 --> 10:36:19,960
I think I did it. Please no more surprises.

8483
10:36:19,960 --> 10:36:22,960
I can't handle it. I can't handle any more of that.

8484
10:36:26,960 --> 10:36:29,960
I knew I could get a damage bonus if I sneak that.

8485
10:36:29,960 --> 10:36:31,960
Which I'm glad I got it.

8486
10:36:32,960 --> 10:36:34,960
Oh my god.

8487
10:36:34,960 --> 10:36:36,960
Is there a safe thing and you guys can come in again?

8488
10:36:36,960 --> 10:36:39,960
Holy crap, this map. Why is this game so big?

8489
10:36:39,960 --> 10:36:40,960
Seriously.

8490
10:36:40,960 --> 10:36:43,960
Normally it's like, oh, why is this game so small?

8491
10:36:43,960 --> 10:36:45,960
There's not enough content.

8492
10:36:45,960 --> 10:36:47,960
Look how high, what elevated we are.

8493
10:36:47,960 --> 10:36:50,960
I cannot imagine the elevation difference.

8494
10:36:55,960 --> 10:36:57,960
What the fuck am I doing here?

8495
10:36:57,960 --> 10:36:59,960
Okay, where now?

8496
10:37:01,960 --> 10:37:05,960
Go left, and what happens when I go left?

8497
10:37:05,960 --> 10:37:08,960
Then up the ladder. Left and up the ladder.

8498
10:37:09,960 --> 10:37:11,960
Ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder, ladder.

8499
10:37:11,960 --> 10:37:14,960
Oh, the relief.

8500
10:37:14,960 --> 10:37:19,960
The fucking relief that watches over me seeing this.

8501
10:37:19,960 --> 10:37:21,960
Oh lord.

8502
10:37:22,960 --> 10:37:25,960
Oh lord, the relief.

8503
10:37:26,960 --> 10:37:28,960
Why can't I just have that all the time?

8504
10:37:29,960 --> 10:37:32,960
Why can't you just give me that all the time?

8505
10:37:32,960 --> 10:37:35,960
Goodness, gravy. How can he handle that?

8506
10:37:35,960 --> 10:37:36,960
My wee heart.

8507
10:37:37,960 --> 10:37:39,960
Oh, literally, an assassin is creeped up here.

8508
10:37:39,960 --> 10:37:42,960
Do not be detected by any nearby enemies.

8509
10:37:44,960 --> 10:37:46,960
Is there any other reefling that has this one?

8510
10:37:46,960 --> 10:37:49,960
It's called the storehouse back section.

8511
10:37:53,960 --> 10:37:55,960
Oh, don't let it happen again.

8512
10:38:07,960 --> 10:38:09,960
Oh, there's just moustaches in there.

8513
10:38:09,960 --> 10:38:11,960
They're back together.

8514
10:38:12,960 --> 10:38:14,960
Good morning.

8515
10:38:14,960 --> 10:38:16,960
Wakey, wakey.

8516
10:38:18,960 --> 10:38:20,960
Dude, lovers.

8517
10:38:20,960 --> 10:38:22,960
We're bitten from one another.

8518
10:38:22,960 --> 10:38:26,960
Our people face them.

8519
10:38:29,960 --> 10:38:33,960
And the mountain debates them apart.

8520
10:38:33,960 --> 10:38:35,960
I said that wrong.

8521
10:38:37,960 --> 10:38:40,960
Is there no other reefling that can join in right now?

8522
10:38:40,960 --> 10:38:41,960
It's okay.

8523
10:38:41,960 --> 10:38:43,960
If not.

8524
10:38:43,960 --> 10:38:45,960
Stranny, I don't like seeing you scared,

8525
10:38:45,960 --> 10:38:47,960
but you're actually giving me one.

8526
10:38:47,960 --> 10:38:50,960
Damn, it's fucking terrifying.

8527
10:38:50,960 --> 10:38:52,960
Why is there a mark on this right here?

8528
10:38:52,960 --> 10:38:53,960
I don't know.

8529
10:38:53,960 --> 10:38:55,960
My sign is done.

8530
10:38:55,960 --> 10:38:56,960
I'm not sure where I am.

8531
10:38:56,960 --> 10:38:57,960
Have you done something?

8532
10:38:57,960 --> 10:38:59,960
Are you in New Game Plus?

8533
10:38:59,960 --> 10:39:01,960
Are you in New Game Plus?

8534
10:39:02,960 --> 10:39:06,960
And the mountain fights them apart.

8535
10:39:08,960 --> 10:39:09,960
I'll give it.

8536
10:39:09,960 --> 10:39:11,960
You have 20 more seconds, Mr. Symbol,

8537
10:39:11,960 --> 10:39:14,960
to show up, or we're claiming that ladder.

8538
10:39:16,960 --> 10:39:18,960
I'm hunting for the symbol.

8539
10:39:23,960 --> 10:39:24,960
Do you think?

8540
10:39:24,960 --> 10:39:25,960
Right, hold on.

8541
10:39:25,960 --> 10:39:26,960
Let's do this.

8542
10:39:26,960 --> 10:39:27,960
Oh.

8543
10:39:27,960 --> 10:39:32,960
You smell like you need food.

8544
10:39:32,960 --> 10:39:35,960
And I'm the only one that can give you food.

8545
10:39:40,960 --> 10:39:41,960
What?

8546
10:39:41,960 --> 10:39:42,960
I got a katana.

8547
10:39:42,960 --> 10:39:44,960
Well, I don't like her katana.

8548
10:39:48,960 --> 10:39:51,960
The lift gets a real gunner.

8549
10:39:51,960 --> 10:39:52,960
Wow.

8550
10:39:55,960 --> 10:39:58,960
Didn't you want to go to sleep like six hours ago?

8551
10:39:58,960 --> 10:39:59,960
Maybe.

8552
10:39:59,960 --> 10:40:01,960
After moaning about a coconut?

8553
10:40:01,960 --> 10:40:02,960
Oh, right.

8554
10:40:02,960 --> 10:40:03,960
The moaning coconut.

8555
10:40:03,960 --> 10:40:05,960
I don't know why I can't see.

8556
10:40:07,960 --> 10:40:08,960
Oh, is it your turn now?

8557
10:40:08,960 --> 10:40:09,960
Okay, okay.

8558
10:40:09,960 --> 10:40:10,960
Hold on.

8559
10:40:10,960 --> 10:40:11,960
Let's do the test.

8560
10:40:11,960 --> 10:40:12,960
Hold on to the test.

8561
10:40:15,960 --> 10:40:19,960
A bit sway, rather pungent, but that'll do.

8562
10:40:21,960 --> 10:40:33,960
Um, I don't know why I need the symbol to show up, but it's not having it, right?

8563
10:40:33,960 --> 10:40:37,960
Let's claim these ladders and maybe something a little better.

8564
10:40:37,960 --> 10:40:38,960
Why is it blue?

8565
10:40:38,960 --> 10:40:39,960
Why are you blue?

8566
10:40:39,960 --> 10:40:40,960
Is it any blue?

8567
10:40:40,960 --> 10:40:45,960
Right, there's one enemy there, but I think he likes it a lot.

8568
10:40:45,960 --> 10:40:48,960
Wait, do you guys want to go first?

8569
10:40:48,960 --> 10:40:50,960
Please, gentlemen, first.

8570
10:40:53,960 --> 10:40:57,960
If the others know the way they can show you that pelvis along the table, demolish.

8571
10:40:57,960 --> 10:40:59,960
How does she know?

8572
10:41:03,960 --> 10:41:05,960
Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.

8573
10:41:05,960 --> 10:41:07,960
Oh, we're still one.

8574
10:41:07,960 --> 10:41:08,960
Are we still one?

8575
10:41:08,960 --> 10:41:09,960
Yeah, we are still one.

8576
10:41:09,960 --> 10:41:15,960
Sorry, I thought it was one of those ones where it's like, it's optional to get off here if you want to grab some weird obscure item that no one knows about.

8577
10:41:15,960 --> 10:41:18,960
And it does some weird obscure thing that no one knows about.

8578
10:41:24,960 --> 10:41:26,960
Oh, something's going on up here.

8579
10:41:40,960 --> 10:41:42,960
Are you not two holding the handle?

8580
10:41:42,960 --> 10:41:43,960
Oh, it's the handle?

8581
10:41:43,960 --> 10:41:46,960
Okay, let's go.

8582
10:41:52,960 --> 10:41:53,960
Oh, stagger.

8583
10:41:54,960 --> 10:41:56,960
Low toys, don't care.

8584
10:41:56,960 --> 10:41:57,960
Don't talk to me.

8585
10:41:57,960 --> 10:41:58,960
Go home.

8586
10:41:58,960 --> 10:42:00,960
Back to the urge tree to you.

8587
10:42:00,960 --> 10:42:01,960
What's that?

8588
10:42:01,960 --> 10:42:03,960
You need a mile lower of the game?

8589
10:42:03,960 --> 10:42:04,960
Kind of.

8590
10:42:04,960 --> 10:42:06,960
Sometimes, not on the plane.

8591
10:42:08,960 --> 10:42:10,960
We can't jump up on that.

8592
10:42:10,960 --> 10:42:11,960
That's okay.

8593
10:42:12,960 --> 10:42:15,960
Are you getting ready to slap those two there and all?

8594
10:42:17,960 --> 10:42:20,960
I'm picking up fire serpent.

8595
10:42:23,960 --> 10:42:25,960
There is a window there.

8596
10:42:32,960 --> 10:42:34,960
Is this dangerous?

8597
10:42:36,960 --> 10:42:38,960
There's a window.

8598
10:42:41,960 --> 10:42:42,960
MGA?

8599
10:42:42,960 --> 10:42:43,960
What's MGA?

8600
10:42:43,960 --> 10:42:45,960
Metal Gear Solid?

8601
10:42:46,960 --> 10:42:48,960
I've actually never played this series.

8602
10:42:48,960 --> 10:42:49,960
Is it good?

8603
10:42:49,960 --> 10:42:51,960
I just thought people memed on it a lot.

8604
10:42:56,960 --> 10:42:57,960
Here.

8605
10:43:00,960 --> 10:43:02,960
Okay, I'm not jumping that way.

8606
10:43:04,960 --> 10:43:05,960
Wait, you'd love it?

8607
10:43:05,960 --> 10:43:07,960
With the politics in the game?

8608
10:43:07,960 --> 10:43:08,960
Stop!

8609
10:43:09,960 --> 10:43:11,960
Would that, actually?

8610
10:43:14,960 --> 10:43:16,960
You'd love that game, why?

8611
10:43:16,960 --> 10:43:17,960
Because of the politics.

8612
10:43:17,960 --> 10:43:18,960
Oh, okay.

8613
10:43:19,960 --> 10:43:20,960
It's nonstop tinfoil.

8614
10:43:20,960 --> 10:43:21,960
Stop!

8615
10:43:21,960 --> 10:43:23,960
Can I put tinfoil hat if you play it?

8616
10:43:24,960 --> 10:43:26,960
Is there any reefling that can come here?

8617
10:43:27,960 --> 10:43:28,960
Oh, no.

8618
10:43:28,960 --> 10:43:29,960
What?

8619
10:43:29,960 --> 10:43:30,960
Can't even open my map.

8620
10:43:32,960 --> 10:43:33,960
Oops.

8621
10:43:34,960 --> 10:43:35,960
I missed my rage.

8622
10:43:35,960 --> 10:43:36,960
Oh, no.

8623
10:43:36,960 --> 10:43:37,960
Oh, no.

8624
10:43:37,960 --> 10:43:38,960
Oh, wait.

8625
10:43:38,960 --> 10:43:40,960
My other right is there.

8626
10:43:40,960 --> 10:43:42,960
I don't know why I don't know.

8627
10:43:43,960 --> 10:43:45,960
You're lucky I caught it that time.

8628
10:43:45,960 --> 10:43:48,960
And before there's symbol appears back there.

8629
10:43:48,960 --> 10:43:50,960
I don't think there is one.

8630
10:43:51,960 --> 10:43:52,960
My lady.

8631
10:43:55,960 --> 10:43:57,960
Wow, this is big.

8632
10:43:58,960 --> 10:44:00,960
It's literally about a secret shadow.

8633
10:44:00,960 --> 10:44:02,960
Shadow government that runs the world.

8634
10:44:02,960 --> 10:44:04,960
Oh, I like that.

8635
10:44:07,960 --> 10:44:09,960
I hear something.

8636
10:44:17,960 --> 10:44:18,960
Gentle, gentle.

8637
10:44:18,960 --> 10:44:20,960
We need to be careful.

8638
10:44:22,960 --> 10:44:25,960
Call me a rabbit because I need to be near here.

8639
10:44:30,960 --> 10:44:32,960
Um, um, um, um, um.

8640
10:44:32,960 --> 10:44:34,960
Wait, isn't it like that?

8641
10:44:34,960 --> 10:44:37,960
Um, the magic place and the main map.

8642
10:44:37,960 --> 10:44:38,960
What do you mean?

8643
10:44:38,960 --> 10:44:39,960
It's a mildly the same.

8644
10:44:39,960 --> 10:44:40,960
Okay.

8645
10:44:40,960 --> 10:44:42,960
Does anyone have long range other than my shitty crossbow?

8646
10:44:42,960 --> 10:44:44,960
I don't think I count.

8647
10:44:45,960 --> 10:44:46,960
But I need these guys.

8648
10:44:46,960 --> 10:44:49,960
These guys are going to like sonic rumors off the damn thing.

8649
10:44:49,960 --> 10:44:52,960
I need, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

8650
10:44:52,960 --> 10:44:54,960
There's like, there's an enemy like right there.

8651
10:44:55,960 --> 10:44:57,960
Where are you going?

8652
10:44:59,960 --> 10:45:01,960
I don't know why the enemy did that.

8653
10:45:01,960 --> 10:45:02,960
Are we to turn back?

8654
10:45:03,960 --> 10:45:05,960
No, there's an enemy over there.

8655
10:45:05,960 --> 10:45:06,960
How did you do that?

8656
10:45:06,960 --> 10:45:07,960
Did you jump?

8657
10:45:07,960 --> 10:45:08,960
Be honest.

8658
10:45:12,960 --> 10:45:14,960
Oh, I didn't like that.

8659
10:45:14,960 --> 10:45:17,960
I don't know, but don't let me do that again.

8660
10:45:23,960 --> 10:45:27,960
Uh, uh, hold on.

8661
10:45:27,960 --> 10:45:30,960
I need to get this thing.

8662
10:45:33,960 --> 10:45:34,960
No!

8663
10:45:35,960 --> 10:45:37,960
Are you fucking serious and getting wall banged?

8664
10:45:37,960 --> 10:45:39,960
Aren't I ironically getting wall banged?

8665
10:45:41,960 --> 10:45:43,960
Aren't I ironically getting wall banged?

8666
10:45:43,960 --> 10:45:44,960
Are you joking?

8667
10:45:44,960 --> 10:45:45,960
I need...

8668
10:45:46,960 --> 10:45:47,960
Hi.

8669
10:45:50,960 --> 10:45:52,960
I'm so sorry, Reflin.

8670
10:45:53,960 --> 10:45:54,960
Oh.

8671
10:45:56,960 --> 10:45:57,960
Well, someone's mad.

8672
10:45:58,960 --> 10:46:00,960
I need to be careful.

8673
10:46:00,960 --> 10:46:02,960
Oh, they can see me from here.

8674
10:46:02,960 --> 10:46:03,960
I need to be careful.

8675
10:46:04,960 --> 10:46:06,960
Oh, Reflin, I don't...

8676
10:46:06,960 --> 10:46:08,960
That's exactly what I was worried about.

8677
10:46:09,960 --> 10:46:11,960
That's exactly what I was worried about.

8678
10:46:11,960 --> 10:46:12,960
Tell you who.

8679
10:46:13,960 --> 10:46:15,960
No, Reflin, you're in the way.

8680
10:46:15,960 --> 10:46:16,960
Oh, darling, you're in the way.

8681
10:46:16,960 --> 10:46:17,960
Careful.

8682
10:46:18,960 --> 10:46:20,960
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

8683
10:46:20,960 --> 10:46:21,960
Sorry, darling.

8684
10:46:21,960 --> 10:46:23,960
You were to just leave at once.

8685
10:46:23,960 --> 10:46:25,960
You were to just leave at once.

8686
10:46:26,960 --> 10:46:29,960
I have no idea what this item is, but yeah, damn.

8687
10:46:29,960 --> 10:46:31,960
It better be worth the heart attack.

8688
10:46:33,960 --> 10:46:35,960
I'm not sure what you are, darling.

8689
10:46:35,960 --> 10:46:36,960
What are you?

8690
10:46:37,960 --> 10:46:38,960
Oh, right.

8691
10:46:38,960 --> 10:46:39,960
Okay, I'll hold on a minute.

8692
10:46:39,960 --> 10:46:41,960
Am I still getting wall banged by that wizard?

8693
10:46:41,960 --> 10:46:42,960
Is he losing at me?

8694
10:46:43,960 --> 10:46:44,960
Wait, where'd you go?

8695
10:46:45,960 --> 10:46:46,960
Reflin?

8696
10:46:46,960 --> 10:46:48,960
Did you go down the ladder?

8697
10:46:48,960 --> 10:46:49,960
Reflin?

8698
10:46:49,960 --> 10:46:50,960
Hello?

8699
10:46:50,960 --> 10:46:51,960
Hello, gay?

8700
10:46:51,960 --> 10:46:52,960
Reflin?

8701
10:46:52,960 --> 10:46:53,960
Reflin?

8702
10:46:53,960 --> 10:46:54,960
Hello?

8703
10:46:54,960 --> 10:46:55,960
I literally cannot see you.

8704
10:46:55,960 --> 10:46:56,960
Where are you?

8705
10:46:57,960 --> 10:46:59,960
You did go down the water, didn't you?

8706
10:47:00,960 --> 10:47:01,960
What the fuck?

8707
10:47:01,960 --> 10:47:02,960
Did he despawn?

8708
10:47:03,960 --> 10:47:04,960
Am I blind?

8709
10:47:04,960 --> 10:47:05,960
Hold on.

8710
10:47:05,960 --> 10:47:06,960
I think I'm going schizophrenic.

8711
10:47:06,960 --> 10:47:09,960
Did I not have a Reflin literally gating me that entire time?

8712
10:47:09,960 --> 10:47:10,960
Where is he?

8713
10:47:19,960 --> 10:47:21,960
I can't see you.

8714
10:47:21,960 --> 10:47:22,960
Whoa!

8715
10:47:23,960 --> 10:47:24,960
They're pissed.

8716
10:47:25,960 --> 10:47:26,960
Did you see that?

8717
10:47:26,960 --> 10:47:28,960
God, they're still locked onto me.

8718
10:47:34,960 --> 10:47:36,960
Okay, I might need to be a bit quick, Reflin,

8719
10:47:36,960 --> 10:47:38,960
just because I've got that enemy target in me

8720
10:47:38,960 --> 10:47:39,960
and they can probably...

8721
10:47:39,960 --> 10:47:40,960
All right, go down.

8722
10:47:40,960 --> 10:47:41,960
Get in.

8723
10:47:41,960 --> 10:47:42,960
In, in, in.

8724
10:47:44,960 --> 10:47:45,960
No, go.

8725
10:47:47,960 --> 10:47:49,960
You've been alone this entire time.

8726
10:47:51,960 --> 10:47:53,960
I really do need to pick up my...

8727
10:47:54,960 --> 10:47:56,960
Wait, the Reflin can spawn here.

8728
10:47:58,960 --> 10:48:00,960
There must be something weird going on.

8729
10:48:00,960 --> 10:48:01,960
He was never there, mommy.

8730
10:48:01,960 --> 10:48:03,960
Don't say such things.

8731
10:48:04,960 --> 10:48:06,960
That bat, literally that bat was like,

8732
10:48:06,960 --> 10:48:08,960
now this ain't worth that amount.

8733
10:48:08,960 --> 10:48:09,960
Have respect.

8734
10:48:09,960 --> 10:48:10,960
Okay, now that we've done that,

8735
10:48:10,960 --> 10:48:12,960
what did we achieve?

8736
10:48:12,960 --> 10:48:13,960
What did we achieve?

8737
10:48:13,960 --> 10:48:14,960
Was that what I was supposed to do?

8738
10:48:14,960 --> 10:48:15,960
Did I achieve what I was supposed to do?

8739
10:48:15,960 --> 10:48:16,960
Huh?

8740
10:48:16,960 --> 10:48:17,960
Huh?

8741
10:48:17,960 --> 10:48:18,960
Huh?

8742
10:48:18,960 --> 10:48:19,960
We achieved.

8743
10:48:19,960 --> 10:48:21,960
We need to go back up again.

8744
10:48:22,960 --> 10:48:23,960
I'm beat.

8745
10:48:23,960 --> 10:48:25,960
Oh, you're getting me back up.

8746
10:48:29,960 --> 10:48:32,960
The real Reflin where the friends can go down.

8747
10:48:33,960 --> 10:48:35,960
If they are, real question mark.

8748
10:48:50,960 --> 10:48:53,960
Oh, yeah.

8749
10:48:53,960 --> 10:48:56,960
We just did a, like, massive view turn.

8750
10:48:57,960 --> 10:48:59,960
When we could have done that the whole time

8751
10:48:59,960 --> 10:49:01,960
and we didn't have to do parkour.

8752
10:49:03,960 --> 10:49:05,960
Wait, we're going back.

8753
10:49:07,960 --> 10:49:09,960
Holy shit, they're pissed.

8754
10:49:09,960 --> 10:49:11,960
They're on the same level right now.

8755
10:49:11,960 --> 10:49:12,960
The freaking...

8756
10:49:12,960 --> 10:49:15,960
The witch is literally over there.

8757
10:49:15,960 --> 10:49:16,960
I'll go.

8758
10:49:17,960 --> 10:49:20,960
Um, should I cross?

8759
10:49:20,960 --> 10:49:21,960
Hold on.

8760
10:49:21,960 --> 10:49:22,960
Hold on.

8761
10:49:22,960 --> 10:49:23,960
Let's see what happens.

8762
10:49:25,960 --> 10:49:26,960
Hold on.

8763
10:49:28,960 --> 10:49:29,960
Oh, wrong one.

8764
10:49:33,960 --> 10:49:34,960
Oh shit, you didn't...

8765
10:49:34,960 --> 10:49:35,960
Oh, my bad.

8766
10:49:35,960 --> 10:49:36,960
I'm helping.

8767
10:49:36,960 --> 10:49:37,960
I'm helping.

8768
10:49:37,960 --> 10:49:38,960
I promise I'm helping.

8769
10:49:39,960 --> 10:49:40,960
See, look, I'm...

8770
10:49:42,960 --> 10:49:43,960
I'm helping.

8771
10:49:43,960 --> 10:49:44,960
I'm helping.

8772
10:49:45,960 --> 10:49:48,960
I think absolutely nothing should use me for a reason.

8773
10:49:49,960 --> 10:49:50,960
Okay, okay, I can do this.

8774
10:49:50,960 --> 10:49:51,960
I can do this.

8775
10:49:51,960 --> 10:49:52,960
I think we'll go a little bit away.

8776
10:49:54,960 --> 10:49:55,960
Skills.

8777
10:49:55,960 --> 10:49:56,960
Skills.

8778
10:49:56,960 --> 10:49:57,960
Do you see that input skill?

8779
10:49:57,960 --> 10:49:58,960
Okay, now we go down.

8780
10:49:59,960 --> 10:50:00,960
Descent.

8781
10:50:04,960 --> 10:50:06,960
Is that not a dark go-short one?

8782
10:50:06,960 --> 10:50:07,960
We've seen it before.

8783
10:50:08,960 --> 10:50:09,960
Ha ha.

8784
10:50:13,960 --> 10:50:14,960
Oh, are we going the wrong way?

8785
10:50:16,960 --> 10:50:17,960
Oopsie doopie.

8786
10:50:17,960 --> 10:50:19,960
We may have made an itchy doopie.

8787
10:50:20,960 --> 10:50:21,960
Okay, okay.

8788
10:50:21,960 --> 10:50:22,960
Okay.

8789
10:50:38,960 --> 10:50:39,960
We're in.

8790
10:50:39,960 --> 10:50:40,960
Can we all fit?

8791
10:50:42,960 --> 10:50:43,960
Are you coming in too?

8792
10:50:43,960 --> 10:50:44,960
Oh, no, he says come this way.

8793
10:50:47,960 --> 10:50:50,960
Oops, we're getting a little turned around in this area.

8794
10:50:50,960 --> 10:50:52,960
There's a lot to be honest, so it's fine.

8795
10:50:55,960 --> 10:50:56,960
Oh, there's an item down here.

8796
10:50:59,960 --> 10:51:01,960
It's missing school and eat.

8797
10:51:02,960 --> 10:51:03,960
Come, come, come.

8798
10:51:03,960 --> 10:51:04,960
Go down, he says.

8799
10:51:05,960 --> 10:51:06,960
Down we go.

8800
10:51:07,960 --> 10:51:08,960
There's a bat down there.

8801
10:51:08,960 --> 10:51:09,960
I will destroy this bat.

8802
10:51:11,960 --> 10:51:12,960
What?

8803
10:51:12,960 --> 10:51:13,960
Yeah!

8804
10:51:14,960 --> 10:51:15,960
Next right, not happening.

8805
10:51:18,960 --> 10:51:19,960
What is this?

8806
10:51:21,960 --> 10:51:22,960
Hmm.

8807
10:51:28,960 --> 10:51:29,960
Okay, now.

8808
10:51:30,960 --> 10:51:32,960
This, like, the map just gets the ground.

8809
10:51:32,960 --> 10:51:33,960
There's only one at a time.

8810
10:51:34,960 --> 10:51:35,960
No.

8811
10:51:36,960 --> 10:51:37,960
Can you fit?

8812
10:51:37,960 --> 10:51:38,960
Okay.

8813
10:51:38,960 --> 10:51:39,960
I don't want to push you off by accident.

8814
10:51:44,960 --> 10:51:46,960
We have trained Johnny wrong as a joke.

8815
10:51:46,960 --> 10:51:47,960
Oh, I'll bite you.

8816
10:51:51,960 --> 10:51:52,960
Did you launch yourself?

8817
10:51:52,960 --> 10:51:53,960
Were you on top of that?

8818
10:51:55,960 --> 10:51:56,960
I think we're on top of that.

8819
10:52:00,960 --> 10:52:01,960
Easy, easy.

8820
10:52:01,960 --> 10:52:02,960
Wait, open this?

8821
10:52:05,960 --> 10:52:06,960
Oh, you don't have the right.

8822
10:52:06,960 --> 10:52:07,960
You don't have the right.

8823
10:52:07,960 --> 10:52:08,960
You don't have the right.

8824
10:52:08,960 --> 10:52:09,960
Okay, and then take this down.

8825
10:52:12,960 --> 10:52:13,960
Okay, we can do it.

8826
10:52:14,960 --> 10:52:15,960
I don't know what we're doing,

8827
10:52:15,960 --> 10:52:17,960
but we're doing something already.

8828
10:52:21,960 --> 10:52:23,960
We have the old mother remote.

8829
10:52:23,960 --> 10:52:24,960
Yes.

8830
10:52:24,960 --> 10:52:25,960
Old mother.

8831
10:52:31,960 --> 10:52:32,960
Old mother.

8832
10:52:37,960 --> 10:52:38,960
I might just pick it up.

8833
10:52:39,960 --> 10:52:40,960
Whoa!

8834
10:52:43,960 --> 10:52:44,960
This is new.

8835
10:52:45,960 --> 10:52:46,960
Is it?

8836
10:52:46,960 --> 10:52:47,960
I think so.

8837
10:52:48,960 --> 10:52:50,960
In the room to the right by the statue,

8838
10:52:50,960 --> 10:52:51,960
use old mother.

8839
10:52:54,960 --> 10:52:55,960
I'm curious.

8840
10:52:59,960 --> 10:53:00,960
Old mother.

8841
10:53:00,960 --> 10:53:01,960
Old mother.

8842
10:53:16,960 --> 10:53:17,960
I'm curious.

8843
10:53:19,960 --> 10:53:20,960
What does this tablet do?

8844
10:53:20,960 --> 10:53:23,960
Have mercy for the start of the game.

8845
10:53:23,960 --> 10:53:25,960
Okay, sadly you have to leave,

8846
10:53:25,960 --> 10:53:27,960
but I assume there's another one.

8847
10:53:28,960 --> 10:53:29,960
Oh, that's so cool.

8848
10:53:29,960 --> 10:53:31,960
I love when games do that thing.

8849
10:53:35,960 --> 10:53:37,960
How on earth is anyone supposed to figure this out?

8850
10:53:37,960 --> 10:53:38,960
Naturally, though,

8851
10:53:38,960 --> 10:53:39,960
without being told what to do

8852
10:53:39,960 --> 10:53:41,960
or the dev team explaining what to do.

8853
10:53:42,960 --> 10:53:44,960
Oh, flowers!

8854
10:53:45,960 --> 10:53:46,960
Oh, my God.

8855
10:53:50,960 --> 10:53:52,960
There's so many!

8856
10:53:52,960 --> 10:53:53,960
Oh, my God.

8857
10:53:53,960 --> 10:53:55,960
How do you even perish here?

8858
10:53:57,960 --> 10:53:58,960
Oh, my God.

8859
10:54:00,960 --> 10:54:01,960
How do you?

8860
10:54:01,960 --> 10:54:02,960
How do you?

8861
10:54:04,960 --> 10:54:05,960
How do you?

8862
10:54:09,960 --> 10:54:10,960
Oh, my game crashed.

8863
10:54:10,960 --> 10:54:12,960
Oh, no, it survived.

8864
10:54:22,960 --> 10:54:24,960
You have to do parallel thinking,

8865
10:54:24,960 --> 10:54:25,960
looking up games on Google.

8866
10:54:25,960 --> 10:54:27,960
Yes, I can't have you guys here,

8867
10:54:27,960 --> 10:54:28,960
because the area is here.

8868
10:54:29,960 --> 10:54:30,960
Word of mouth,

8869
10:54:30,960 --> 10:54:32,960
people try random things in the first one,

8870
10:54:32,960 --> 10:54:33,960
but how?

8871
10:54:35,960 --> 10:54:36,960
Someone saw the statue and said,

8872
10:54:36,960 --> 10:54:37,960
Mom,

8873
10:54:37,960 --> 10:54:39,960
you just nullified it again up.

8874
10:54:42,960 --> 10:54:44,960
Is there anything coming up?

8875
10:54:44,960 --> 10:54:45,960
Oh, there is.

8876
10:54:48,960 --> 10:54:50,960
I think there's only C2, so...

8877
10:54:50,960 --> 10:54:51,960
I'll put C in.

8878
10:54:52,960 --> 10:54:54,960
Following the flow,

8879
10:54:54,960 --> 10:54:55,960
where is the flow?

8880
10:54:55,960 --> 10:54:57,960
Let's see if we can identify these flowers.

8881
10:55:02,960 --> 10:55:03,960
Oh, it's a recolor.

8882
10:55:09,960 --> 10:55:10,960
I don't know any of them.

8883
10:55:10,960 --> 10:55:12,960
I feel like it's a hibiscus

8884
10:55:12,960 --> 10:55:13,960
for the purple one.

8885
10:55:15,960 --> 10:55:18,960
The orange is just a generic coffee, honestly.

8886
10:55:19,960 --> 10:55:20,960
Or is it lavender?

8887
10:55:20,960 --> 10:55:21,960
No, that's not lavender.

8888
10:55:25,960 --> 10:55:28,960
Alright, link from Legend of Zelda again.

8889
10:55:30,960 --> 10:55:32,960
Is there any evil reeflings?

8890
10:55:32,960 --> 10:55:34,960
Or are we all perished at this point?

8891
10:55:38,960 --> 10:55:39,960
Okay.

8892
10:55:39,960 --> 10:55:40,960
Well,

8893
10:55:41,960 --> 10:55:42,960
no time like the prison,

8894
10:55:42,960 --> 10:55:44,960
we get to go through all these pretty flowers.

8895
10:55:44,960 --> 10:55:45,960
I can't believe it.

8896
10:55:46,960 --> 10:55:47,960
Oh, no.

8897
10:55:49,960 --> 10:55:50,960
Why is...

8898
10:55:51,960 --> 10:55:52,960
Why is that here?

8899
10:55:53,960 --> 10:55:54,960
Isn't that the thing

8900
10:55:54,960 --> 10:55:56,960
where an enemy comes out of nowhere?

8901
10:55:58,960 --> 10:55:59,960
Hmm.

8902
10:55:59,960 --> 10:56:02,960
This area is amazing.

8903
10:56:02,960 --> 10:56:03,960
It's so pretty!

8904
10:56:03,960 --> 10:56:05,960
Like, oh my god, dark souls actually

8905
10:56:05,960 --> 10:56:06,960
make like a really pretty ear.

8906
10:56:06,960 --> 10:56:07,960
Oh, eyes are so much blood.

8907
10:56:09,960 --> 10:56:11,960
Someone's getting walloped by something.

8908
10:56:13,960 --> 10:56:14,960
Ah, well, say no more.

8909
10:56:16,960 --> 10:56:17,960
Is he going for me?

8910
10:56:17,960 --> 10:56:18,960
I think so.

8911
10:56:19,960 --> 10:56:20,960
No, he's not going for me.

8912
10:56:20,960 --> 10:56:21,960
Yeah!

8913
10:56:21,960 --> 10:56:22,960
Okay, but...

8914
10:56:24,960 --> 10:56:26,960
Whoa, I can't even get it close.

8915
10:56:26,960 --> 10:56:29,960
I think I'm going to have to do baby stabs on him.

8916
10:56:29,960 --> 10:56:31,960
I'm too slow.

8917
10:56:31,960 --> 10:56:33,960
I think we're all too slow.

8918
10:56:35,960 --> 10:56:37,960
Can the horse even get staggered?

8919
10:56:48,960 --> 10:56:49,960
Oh!

8920
10:56:49,960 --> 10:56:50,960
We did stagger him.

8921
10:56:50,960 --> 10:56:51,960
Oh, no.

8922
10:56:51,960 --> 10:56:53,960
Sorry, I think I messed up.

8923
10:57:00,960 --> 10:57:01,960
I think we're doing all right.

8924
10:57:02,960 --> 10:57:03,960
Hello.

8925
10:57:03,960 --> 10:57:04,960
Well, thanks for the replays.

8926
10:57:04,960 --> 10:57:05,960
We're doing all right.

8927
10:57:18,960 --> 10:57:21,960
Oh, that stamina.

8928
10:57:21,960 --> 10:57:22,960
Ooh!

8929
10:57:27,960 --> 10:57:29,960
Oh, I'm getting freaking...

8930
10:57:34,960 --> 10:57:36,960
I think we're going to do it.

8931
10:57:42,960 --> 10:57:44,960
Whoa, that was a big swing.

8932
10:57:44,960 --> 10:57:45,960
Big swing.

8933
10:57:48,960 --> 10:57:49,960
Oh.

8934
10:57:50,960 --> 10:57:51,960
Wow.

8935
10:57:53,960 --> 10:57:55,960
That was fantastic.

8936
10:57:56,960 --> 10:57:59,960
Blessings of Marica, be upon me.

8937
10:57:59,960 --> 10:58:01,960
Do you guys despawn?

8938
10:58:02,960 --> 10:58:05,960
Or do we get to stand because it's...

8939
10:58:06,960 --> 10:58:08,960
Are you guys despawning or saying?

8940
10:58:08,960 --> 10:58:10,960
I don't know how it works here.

8941
10:58:11,960 --> 10:58:13,960
Grab it and twist his thoughts.

8942
10:58:13,960 --> 10:58:14,960
Grab it.

8943
10:58:14,960 --> 10:58:16,960
Grab it and twist his thoughts.

8944
10:58:16,960 --> 10:58:17,960
Grab it.

8945
10:58:17,960 --> 10:58:19,960
Okay, let's see what you guys get to say.

8946
10:58:20,960 --> 10:58:21,960
Okay.

8947
10:58:21,960 --> 10:58:22,960
See?

8948
10:58:22,960 --> 10:58:23,960
Exactly.

8949
10:58:23,960 --> 10:58:24,960
This is why...

8950
10:58:24,960 --> 10:58:25,960
Whoa.

8951
10:58:25,960 --> 10:58:26,960
Who not?

8952
10:58:26,960 --> 10:58:31,960
Enemy tangles spotted on 9 o'clock.

8953
10:58:32,960 --> 10:58:34,960
But we're not going to bother them,

8954
10:58:34,960 --> 10:58:36,960
so they're not going to bother us.

8955
10:58:37,960 --> 10:58:38,960
What's the tree sent another one?

8956
10:58:38,960 --> 10:58:39,960
They said,

8957
10:58:39,960 --> 10:58:40,960
Oh, is the tree sent another one

8958
10:58:40,960 --> 10:58:42,960
not hard enough for your new area?

8959
10:58:42,960 --> 10:58:44,960
Let's just add another one and buff them up.

8960
10:58:47,960 --> 10:58:48,960
Oh, my God.

8961
10:58:48,960 --> 10:58:50,960
See, this is where we're living.

8962
10:58:50,960 --> 10:58:52,960
A shaman's village.

8963
10:58:52,960 --> 10:58:53,960
Aw.

8964
10:58:55,960 --> 10:58:57,960
Look at all the flowers.

8965
10:58:59,960 --> 10:59:01,960
We love pretty flowers in this place.

8966
10:59:01,960 --> 10:59:03,960
Oh, is there a golden seed here?

8967
10:59:03,960 --> 10:59:05,960
Or is there no such thing as golden seed here?

8968
10:59:06,960 --> 10:59:07,960
Uh...

8969
10:59:11,960 --> 10:59:12,960
Straight to jail.

8970
10:59:14,960 --> 10:59:15,960
Teasing.

8971
10:59:15,960 --> 10:59:16,960
I'm teasing.

8972
10:59:18,960 --> 10:59:19,960
Whoa.

8973
10:59:19,960 --> 10:59:20,960
Is that noise?

8974
10:59:20,960 --> 10:59:21,960
I'm getting trolled.

8975
10:59:25,960 --> 10:59:26,960
Hello?

8976
10:59:28,960 --> 10:59:29,960
I heard something.

8977
10:59:31,960 --> 10:59:32,960
Knock, knock.

8978
10:59:32,960 --> 10:59:34,960
Okay, no one's home.

8979
10:59:36,960 --> 10:59:38,960
That's where I've been.

8980
10:59:38,960 --> 10:59:40,960
Not the music being the most peaceful music

8981
10:59:40,960 --> 10:59:43,960
I've ever heard in the entire series as well.

8982
10:59:44,960 --> 10:59:48,960
Just like a very quiet, low-toned heart.

8983
10:59:48,960 --> 10:59:51,960
Not giving off any emotion of excitement or...

8984
10:59:53,960 --> 10:59:55,960
I'm fucking losing it.

8985
10:59:58,960 --> 11:00:00,960
There's something here, guys.

8986
11:00:02,960 --> 11:00:03,960
Is it me?

8987
11:00:06,960 --> 11:00:08,960
I think it might be background noise,

8988
11:00:08,960 --> 11:00:11,960
but they're, for some reason, made it...

8989
11:00:13,960 --> 11:00:14,960
Is it me?

8990
11:00:14,960 --> 11:00:15,960
I'm going...

8991
11:00:15,960 --> 11:00:16,960
Sorry, I'm losing it.

8992
11:00:16,960 --> 11:00:17,960
I'm actually losing it.

8993
11:00:17,960 --> 11:00:18,960
I need to go to bed.

8994
11:00:18,960 --> 11:00:19,960
Holy crap.

8995
11:00:19,960 --> 11:00:20,960
I'm just straight up still spinning.

8996
11:00:20,960 --> 11:00:21,960
Okay.

8997
11:00:21,960 --> 11:00:24,960
We've got a golden lock of hair.

8998
11:00:24,960 --> 11:00:27,960
We've got Galadriel's lock of hair.

8999
11:00:27,960 --> 11:00:28,960
Holy.

9000
11:00:28,960 --> 11:00:29,960
Yes.

9001
11:00:30,960 --> 11:00:31,960
Good morning, woman.

9002
11:00:31,960 --> 11:00:33,960
I hope you're feeling better.

9003
11:00:33,960 --> 11:00:35,960
I fell asleep while I was...

9004
11:00:36,960 --> 11:00:37,960
What are you talking about?

9005
11:00:37,960 --> 11:00:38,960
There's nothing here.

9006
11:00:38,960 --> 11:00:40,960
Literally, I'm going crazy.

9007
11:00:41,960 --> 11:00:43,960
There's noises being made.

9008
11:00:52,960 --> 11:00:53,960
Attuded.

9009
11:00:53,960 --> 11:00:55,960
What are you going to do about it?

9010
11:00:58,960 --> 11:00:59,960
Oh, my God.

9011
11:00:59,960 --> 11:01:02,960
And I can't believe I complained

9012
11:01:02,960 --> 11:01:05,960
for a peaceful area where things don't attack you.

9013
11:01:05,960 --> 11:01:07,960
And I actually got it.

9014
11:01:07,960 --> 11:01:12,960
I actually got a peaceful, beautiful, nature-esque area.

9015
11:01:12,960 --> 11:01:13,960
Wow.

9016
11:01:13,960 --> 11:01:15,960
10 out of 10.

9017
11:01:15,960 --> 11:01:16,960
DLC.

9018
11:01:16,960 --> 11:01:17,960
Good.

9019
11:01:17,960 --> 11:01:18,960
Very recommend.

9020
11:01:24,960 --> 11:01:26,960
You've been going for 11 hours.

9021
11:01:26,960 --> 11:01:27,960
All this craziness.

9022
11:01:27,960 --> 11:01:28,960
Oh, did we hit 11 hours?

9023
11:01:28,960 --> 11:01:29,960
Well, there we go.

9024
11:01:31,960 --> 11:01:33,960
Honestly, every time Miya starts,

9025
11:01:33,960 --> 11:01:35,960
I'm like, I'm only doing six hours.

9026
11:01:35,960 --> 11:01:36,960
It's going to be shorter.

9027
11:01:36,960 --> 11:01:37,960
Oh, I'm only doing eight hours.

9028
11:01:37,960 --> 11:01:39,960
Oh, it's going to be shorter.

9029
11:01:39,960 --> 11:01:40,960
And then it's just like...

9030
11:01:40,960 --> 11:01:41,960
But after the eight hour mark,

9031
11:01:41,960 --> 11:01:43,960
I'm pretty sure we all just accept,

9032
11:01:43,960 --> 11:01:46,960
like, yeah, we're going for another four hours.

9033
11:01:46,960 --> 11:01:48,960
Are we going for them?

9034
11:01:49,960 --> 11:01:51,960
I don't have much heels,

9035
11:01:51,960 --> 11:01:53,960
but we can go for them.

9036
11:01:59,960 --> 11:02:01,960
Okay, we're doing it.

9037
11:02:01,960 --> 11:02:02,960
Jump them.

9038
11:02:04,960 --> 11:02:06,960
Regalings, stop this man.

9039
11:02:10,960 --> 11:02:12,960
He took half my health.

9040
11:02:14,960 --> 11:02:15,960
Oh, no.

9041
11:02:29,960 --> 11:02:30,960
It's his?

9042
11:02:30,960 --> 11:02:31,960
Oh, I'm out of stamina.

9043
11:02:31,960 --> 11:02:32,960
I'm sorry.

9044
11:02:35,960 --> 11:02:37,960
Miya, why am I not whacking him?

9045
11:02:37,960 --> 11:02:39,960
I literally have no stamina left.

9046
11:02:45,960 --> 11:02:47,960
Oh, I don't want to get perished.

9047
11:02:49,960 --> 11:02:50,960
I might get perished.

9048
11:02:52,960 --> 11:02:53,960
Oh, I missed.

9049
11:02:53,960 --> 11:02:54,960
I missed.

9050
11:02:57,960 --> 11:02:59,960
I have terrible news briefings.

9051
11:02:59,960 --> 11:03:00,960
I'm out of flash.

9052
11:03:00,960 --> 11:03:03,960
I think you guys are going to have to take over.

9053
11:03:04,960 --> 11:03:05,960
Hold on.

9054
11:03:05,960 --> 11:03:06,960
Let me get my board.

9055
11:03:06,960 --> 11:03:07,960
I can help.

9056
11:03:07,960 --> 11:03:08,960
I can help.

9057
11:03:08,960 --> 11:03:09,960
I promise I can help.

9058
11:03:09,960 --> 11:03:10,960
Nope, wrong one.

9059
11:03:10,960 --> 11:03:11,960
Shit.

9060
11:03:11,960 --> 11:03:12,960
Hold on.

9061
11:03:12,960 --> 11:03:13,960
Hold on.

9062
11:03:13,960 --> 11:03:14,960
Hold the line.

9063
11:03:14,960 --> 11:03:15,960
You're doing great.

9064
11:03:15,960 --> 11:03:16,960
You're doing great.

9065
11:03:16,960 --> 11:03:17,960
Mom's proud.

9066
11:03:17,960 --> 11:03:18,960
Oh, my God.

9067
11:03:18,960 --> 11:03:20,960
Please, man, you go away so I can actually help.

9068
11:03:23,960 --> 11:03:25,960
I've done a whole 75 damage.

9069
11:03:25,960 --> 11:03:27,960
Don't you worry, Reflins.

9070
11:03:27,960 --> 11:03:28,960
I've got you.

9071
11:03:30,960 --> 11:03:32,960
Is this guy missing on purpose?

9072
11:03:37,960 --> 11:03:38,960
Oh, God.

9073
11:03:38,960 --> 11:03:39,960
Where are the-

9074
11:03:39,960 --> 11:03:40,960
Hello?

9075
11:03:40,960 --> 11:03:43,960
Did he just go invisible or did I just, like,

9076
11:03:43,960 --> 11:03:44,960
go out of bounds?

9077
11:03:44,960 --> 11:03:45,960
Because what was that?

9078
11:03:49,960 --> 11:03:51,960
I'm trying to give him bleed arrows.

9079
11:03:51,960 --> 11:03:53,960
Trying being the main freaking-

9080
11:03:54,960 --> 11:03:56,960
Yeah, forget your silly damage.

9081
11:03:57,960 --> 11:03:58,960
Whoa.

9082
11:04:04,960 --> 11:04:05,960
I'm trying.

9083
11:04:05,960 --> 11:04:06,960
I'm trying.

9084
11:04:06,960 --> 11:04:07,960
My crosshair's on him.

9085
11:04:07,960 --> 11:04:09,960
I just freaking do it, okay?

9086
11:04:10,960 --> 11:04:11,960
I'm-

9087
11:04:15,960 --> 11:04:16,960
Um...

9088
11:04:16,960 --> 11:04:17,960
Um...

9089
11:04:20,960 --> 11:04:22,960
Oh, what did he do?

9090
11:04:22,960 --> 11:04:25,960
I didn't even know he could do that.

9091
11:04:25,960 --> 11:04:27,960
You're carrying so hard.

9092
11:04:27,960 --> 11:04:29,960
Yeah, you're, like, my 75 damage.

9093
11:04:30,960 --> 11:04:31,960
Bruh.

9094
11:04:34,960 --> 11:04:36,960
How did I use this?

9095
11:04:38,960 --> 11:04:39,960
Oh, is that it?

9096
11:04:42,960 --> 11:04:44,960
Is it, like, unlimited use?

9097
11:04:44,960 --> 11:04:46,960
Trying to just, like, fire everything?

9098
11:04:47,960 --> 11:04:49,960
Oh, it's not even taking any stamina or anything.

9099
11:04:52,960 --> 11:04:54,960
Fuck it, I'm gonna try that.

9100
11:04:54,960 --> 11:04:56,960
Okay, let's try this again.

9101
11:04:57,960 --> 11:05:00,960
Rope hop to literally halfway across the map.

9102
11:05:00,960 --> 11:05:02,960
Who was an adventure?

9103
11:05:02,960 --> 11:05:03,960
Oh, you weren't an-

9104
11:05:03,960 --> 11:05:04,960
No, where-

9105
11:05:04,960 --> 11:05:06,960
You weren't an adventure.

9106
11:05:08,960 --> 11:05:10,960
You weren't an adventure.

9107
11:05:10,960 --> 11:05:12,960
Were you an adventure?

9108
11:05:13,960 --> 11:05:14,960
I'm moving up.

9109
11:05:14,960 --> 11:05:15,960
I'm- I'm gonna try the fire.

9110
11:05:15,960 --> 11:05:16,960
I don't know what the heck it is.

9111
11:05:16,960 --> 11:05:19,960
It's also dual wield if you get two.

9112
11:05:20,960 --> 11:05:21,960
Damn.

9113
11:05:25,960 --> 11:05:26,960
Oh, reflings.

9114
11:05:26,960 --> 11:05:29,960
It's time to get put to work.

9115
11:05:29,960 --> 11:05:31,960
Get back on the farm.

9116
11:05:31,960 --> 11:05:33,960
Weat those potatoes.

9117
11:05:33,960 --> 11:05:36,960
We are going to have a delicious supper tonight.

9118
11:05:38,960 --> 11:05:39,960
And...

9119
11:05:40,960 --> 11:05:42,960
No, no, no, I wouldn't do that.

9120
11:05:43,960 --> 11:05:44,960
I'm gonna try the flame.

9121
11:05:44,960 --> 11:05:45,960
I don't know.

9122
11:05:45,960 --> 11:05:46,960
I thought it was gonna do much,

9123
11:05:46,960 --> 11:05:48,960
but it's, like, literally three, so...

9124
11:05:52,960 --> 11:05:53,960
Let's get to it.

9125
11:05:53,960 --> 11:05:54,960
To it.

9126
11:05:54,960 --> 11:05:56,960
Let's get this party started.

9127
11:05:56,960 --> 11:05:59,960
You hit Y and right bumper to dual wield it.

9128
11:05:59,960 --> 11:06:00,960
Y and right bumper.

9129
11:06:02,960 --> 11:06:03,960
That was a left bumper.

9130
11:06:03,960 --> 11:06:04,960
Left bumper.

9131
11:06:08,960 --> 11:06:09,960
Oh!

9132
11:06:14,960 --> 11:06:16,960
Hi, cast pyro!

9133
11:06:20,960 --> 11:06:21,960
The fire?

9134
11:06:21,960 --> 11:06:22,960
Wait, wait, wait.

9135
11:06:22,960 --> 11:06:23,960
Set it on, set it on.

9136
11:06:25,960 --> 11:06:26,960
Please, what?

9137
11:06:26,960 --> 11:06:27,960
I'm sorry.

9138
11:06:27,960 --> 11:06:28,960
I feel like it would hurt.

9139
11:06:29,960 --> 11:06:31,960
I would, uh...

9140
11:06:31,960 --> 11:06:33,960
I am not sure...

9141
11:06:37,960 --> 11:06:39,960
Right, what happens now?

9142
11:06:39,960 --> 11:06:40,960
Achoo!

9143
11:06:40,960 --> 11:06:41,960
Achoo!

9144
11:06:41,960 --> 11:06:43,960
Oh, my God, it does nothing.

9145
11:06:43,960 --> 11:06:44,960
It does nothing.

9146
11:06:44,960 --> 11:06:45,960
I mean, I'm not surprised

9147
11:06:45,960 --> 11:06:47,960
considering it didn't specialize in it or anything,

9148
11:06:47,960 --> 11:06:48,960
but...

9149
11:06:48,960 --> 11:06:50,960
Yeah, let's just, uh...

9150
11:06:50,960 --> 11:06:51,960
Get this out.

9151
11:06:54,960 --> 11:06:55,960
What?

9152
11:06:55,960 --> 11:06:56,960
What?

9153
11:07:01,960 --> 11:07:03,960
Whoa, we are doing stuff.

9154
11:07:03,960 --> 11:07:04,960
Stuff to him.

9155
11:07:06,960 --> 11:07:08,960
Oh, I always knock him out of that.

9156
11:07:08,960 --> 11:07:09,960
I'm so sorry.

9157
11:07:09,960 --> 11:07:10,960
I knocked him out of the special attack there.

9158
11:07:10,960 --> 11:07:11,960
Am I bad?

9159
11:07:11,960 --> 11:07:12,960
Oh.

9160
11:07:12,960 --> 11:07:13,960
I moved a little to the left

9161
11:07:13,960 --> 11:07:15,960
and managed to avoid his attack.

9162
11:07:15,960 --> 11:07:16,960
That was funny.

9163
11:07:19,960 --> 11:07:20,960
Hey, leave him alone.

9164
11:07:22,960 --> 11:07:23,960
Leave him alone.

9165
11:07:23,960 --> 11:07:24,960
Jeez, change, change.

9166
11:07:24,960 --> 11:07:25,960
Look at me.

9167
11:07:26,960 --> 11:07:28,960
He does not want to change off of you.

9168
11:07:29,960 --> 11:07:30,960
Jeez.

9169
11:07:32,960 --> 11:07:34,960
Okay, have it out.

9170
11:07:34,960 --> 11:07:35,960
Shit.

9171
11:07:38,960 --> 11:07:40,960
Okay, I actually have heals this time,

9172
11:07:40,960 --> 11:07:42,960
so not too much.

9173
11:07:52,960 --> 11:07:53,960
Oh, I knocked it.

9174
11:07:55,960 --> 11:07:58,960
Okay, that horse jumped over me.

9175
11:07:58,960 --> 11:07:59,960
Oh.

9176
11:07:59,960 --> 11:08:00,960
Not good, not good, not good.

9177
11:08:00,960 --> 11:08:01,960
Give me that.

9178
11:08:02,960 --> 11:08:03,960
Give me a good chip.

9179
11:08:09,960 --> 11:08:10,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

9180
11:08:10,960 --> 11:08:11,960
I need a cheeky heal after that one.

9181
11:08:11,960 --> 11:08:12,960
Hold on.

9182
11:08:20,960 --> 11:08:21,960
Jeez.

9183
11:08:21,960 --> 11:08:23,960
Get further and further away from me.

9184
11:08:26,960 --> 11:08:27,960
I'm trying.

9185
11:08:27,960 --> 11:08:28,960
I'm trying.

9186
11:08:29,960 --> 11:08:31,960
Is there any damage to help me?

9187
11:08:31,960 --> 11:08:32,960
Oh, and of course,

9188
11:08:32,960 --> 11:08:34,960
I get a hit when I'm out of stamina.

9189
11:08:39,960 --> 11:08:40,960
We're almost there.

9190
11:08:41,960 --> 11:08:43,960
Take your days, horseman.

9191
11:08:47,960 --> 11:08:48,960
Oh.

9192
11:08:48,960 --> 11:08:49,960
Oh.

9193
11:08:49,960 --> 11:08:50,960
Oh, come on.

9194
11:08:50,960 --> 11:08:52,960
The physics were going nuts there.

9195
11:08:53,960 --> 11:08:54,960
Oh.

9196
11:08:54,960 --> 11:08:56,960
Gee is a shot, mate.

9197
11:08:56,960 --> 11:08:57,960
Gee is a shot.

9198
11:09:02,960 --> 11:09:03,960
Oh, my God.

9199
11:09:03,960 --> 11:09:05,960
He just turned to face me last second.

9200
11:09:10,960 --> 11:09:11,960
Oh, goodness me.

9201
11:09:11,960 --> 11:09:13,960
Does he do some damage?

9202
11:09:13,960 --> 11:09:15,960
He's stuck on the hill.

9203
11:09:22,960 --> 11:09:24,960
If he does that holy shield thing,

9204
11:09:24,960 --> 11:09:26,960
by the way, don't let him actually...

9205
11:09:26,960 --> 11:09:27,960
Oh, no.

9206
11:09:28,960 --> 11:09:29,960
Oh, no.

9207
11:09:31,960 --> 11:09:32,960
Hold on.

9208
11:09:33,960 --> 11:09:35,960
Oh, he took one HP in a dream.

9209
11:09:38,960 --> 11:09:40,960
Whoa, who's gonna die now?

9210
11:09:41,960 --> 11:09:42,960
Oh.

9211
11:09:43,960 --> 11:09:45,960
Whoa, the final blow.

9212
11:09:47,960 --> 11:09:49,960
I'm truly blessed that there's actually...

9213
11:09:49,960 --> 11:09:50,960
Oh, my goodness me.

9214
11:09:50,960 --> 11:09:52,960
Bro, are we where it's built?

9215
11:09:52,960 --> 11:09:56,960
I actually don't know if there's another one.

9216
11:09:56,960 --> 11:09:58,960
Right, well, we'll go back and pick up a refill

9217
11:09:58,960 --> 11:09:59,960
and really quickly.

9218
11:09:59,960 --> 11:10:00,960
Hold on.

9219
11:10:00,960 --> 11:10:01,960
I'm coming.

9220
11:10:03,960 --> 11:10:04,960
Real finger.

9221
11:10:04,960 --> 11:10:05,960
Wait, you let...

9222
11:10:05,960 --> 11:10:06,960
Oh, you...

9223
11:10:06,960 --> 11:10:07,960
Oh, because I...

9224
11:10:07,960 --> 11:10:09,960
Wait, that kind of just a boss as well.

9225
11:10:10,960 --> 11:10:11,960
It's starting to if you whip me

9226
11:10:11,960 --> 11:10:12,960
every more than half of it,

9227
11:10:12,960 --> 11:10:13,960
and I can explain.

9228
11:10:13,960 --> 11:10:14,960
Bro, but it's staying.

9229
11:10:14,960 --> 11:10:16,960
Like, whips are serious.

9230
11:10:17,960 --> 11:10:19,960
If you mean like a Raiden Crop,

9231
11:10:19,960 --> 11:10:20,960
I think that's okay,

9232
11:10:20,960 --> 11:10:21,960
but I couldn't imagine

9233
11:10:21,960 --> 11:10:23,960
like actually inflict some damage on a refund.

9234
11:10:23,960 --> 11:10:25,960
I just feel like I'm so sorry.

9235
11:10:26,960 --> 11:10:28,960
Then again, also me, like,

9236
11:10:28,960 --> 11:10:30,960
with literal acquisition.

9237
11:10:30,960 --> 11:10:31,960
Get up.

9238
11:10:31,960 --> 11:10:32,960
Wait, where is it?

9239
11:10:32,960 --> 11:10:33,960
Is there no...

9240
11:10:33,960 --> 11:10:34,960
Oh.

9241
11:10:37,960 --> 11:10:38,960
I've got one refill.

9242
11:10:39,960 --> 11:10:41,960
I've got two refill in here.

9243
11:10:42,960 --> 11:10:43,960
And let's go.

9244
11:10:44,960 --> 11:10:45,960
Follow the path then.

9245
11:10:45,960 --> 11:10:47,960
You can use part now.

9246
11:10:47,960 --> 11:10:48,960
Yeah, I've got my refunds

9247
11:10:48,960 --> 11:10:50,960
to help me follow the path then.

9248
11:10:51,960 --> 11:10:52,960
I'm the horse.

9249
11:10:52,960 --> 11:10:53,960
They can ride me.

9250
11:10:59,960 --> 11:11:00,960
That scared me.

9251
11:11:00,960 --> 11:11:01,960
Don't make that...

9252
11:11:01,960 --> 11:11:02,960
Oh, you're mean.

9253
11:11:02,960 --> 11:11:04,960
Aw, they had to put me...

9254
11:11:06,960 --> 11:11:07,960
Oh, you're healing me.

9255
11:11:07,960 --> 11:11:08,960
Thank you.

9256
11:11:10,960 --> 11:11:12,960
As long as you're trying your best.

9257
11:11:13,960 --> 11:11:14,960
Remember that time I said

9258
11:11:14,960 --> 11:11:16,960
I was gonna subtitle the mimosa video?

9259
11:11:17,960 --> 11:11:18,960
The mimosa ASMR flop?

9260
11:11:20,960 --> 11:11:22,960
She is so patient with me.

9261
11:11:28,960 --> 11:11:30,960
Wow, the boar's coming to get me.

9262
11:11:33,960 --> 11:11:35,960
It's a good thing.

9263
11:11:36,960 --> 11:11:37,960
I think there's a thing

9264
11:11:37,960 --> 11:11:39,960
and then there's like, ow.

9265
11:11:40,960 --> 11:11:42,960
I feel like that would be ow.

9266
11:11:45,960 --> 11:11:47,960
Stone bell bearing.

9267
11:11:47,960 --> 11:11:48,960
Mmm.

9268
11:11:48,960 --> 11:11:50,960
I do need to upgrade this sword.

9269
11:11:51,960 --> 11:11:53,960
I keep falling for like, exploring and like,

9270
11:11:53,960 --> 11:11:54,960
ooh, what's next, what's next?

9271
11:11:54,960 --> 11:11:55,960
Instead of like, okay,

9272
11:11:55,960 --> 11:11:56,960
maybe I should upgrade my base stuff

9273
11:11:56,960 --> 11:11:58,960
so it'll actually hit a bit harder.

9274
11:11:59,960 --> 11:12:00,960
Instead of being like, wow,

9275
11:12:00,960 --> 11:12:02,960
I'm only doing 100 damage every turn.

9276
11:12:02,960 --> 11:12:03,960
Hmm, what a surprise.

9277
11:12:03,960 --> 11:12:04,960
Does anyone even shop?

9278
11:12:06,960 --> 11:12:08,960
Is my tummy rumbling for food?

9279
11:12:09,960 --> 11:12:10,960
I ate.

9280
11:12:10,960 --> 11:12:11,960
I had a burger.

9281
11:12:11,960 --> 11:12:12,960
I'm chicken.

9282
11:12:12,960 --> 11:12:13,960
What are you eating?

9283
11:12:14,960 --> 11:12:16,960
Wow, there's a thing.

9284
11:12:16,960 --> 11:12:17,960
Oh, maybe I should have done that

9285
11:12:17,960 --> 11:12:18,960
and called you guys in

9286
11:12:18,960 --> 11:12:19,960
instead of making you go for

9287
11:12:19,960 --> 11:12:21,960
a jogging exercise routine.

9288
11:12:22,960 --> 11:12:23,960
Left foot, right foot.

9289
11:12:23,960 --> 11:12:24,960
Left foot, right foot.

9290
11:12:24,960 --> 11:12:25,960
A thing.

9291
11:12:25,960 --> 11:12:26,960
Oh, there's an enemy we've learned.

9292
11:12:28,960 --> 11:12:30,960
Oh, there's two enemy we've learned.

9293
11:12:30,960 --> 11:12:32,960
So there's not been none forever.

9294
11:12:34,960 --> 11:12:36,960
Have you been in for a while?

9295
11:12:36,960 --> 11:12:37,960
I don't think so.

9296
11:12:39,960 --> 11:12:40,960
What's that?

9297
11:12:40,960 --> 11:12:41,960
Did you just drop a turd?

9298
11:12:41,960 --> 11:12:42,960
What did you just do?

9299
11:12:44,960 --> 11:12:46,960
It's called first love students, do you know what?

9300
11:12:46,960 --> 11:12:47,960
If you upgrade your weapon,

9301
11:12:47,960 --> 11:12:48,960
you'll deal massive damage.

9302
11:12:48,960 --> 11:12:50,960
Okay, maybe we should try that tomorrow.

9303
11:12:52,960 --> 11:12:53,960
I didn't stop.

9304
11:12:54,960 --> 11:12:55,960
I didn't take forever.

9305
11:12:55,960 --> 11:12:56,960
I didn't take forever.

9306
11:12:56,960 --> 11:12:57,960
I didn't take forever.

9307
11:12:57,960 --> 11:12:59,960
That tree looks very menacing.

9308
11:13:01,960 --> 11:13:03,960
And I'm dead.

9309
11:13:04,960 --> 11:13:05,960
Whoa.

9310
11:13:07,960 --> 11:13:09,960
You're a bit too excited being spawned in.

9311
11:13:09,960 --> 11:13:10,960
What's going on here?

9312
11:13:10,960 --> 11:13:11,960
Yeah, okay.

9313
11:13:11,960 --> 11:13:12,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9314
11:13:12,960 --> 11:13:13,960
Okay, we forgive you.

9315
11:13:13,960 --> 11:13:14,960
We forgive you.

9316
11:13:14,960 --> 11:13:16,960
You don't have to exile yourself.

9317
11:13:16,960 --> 11:13:17,960
We forgive you.

9318
11:13:18,960 --> 11:13:20,960
It's got a little excited being coming back in.

9319
11:13:21,960 --> 11:13:22,960
Okay.

9320
11:13:22,960 --> 11:13:24,960
Two of the bell bearings are unfortunately

9321
11:13:26,960 --> 11:13:27,960
Azula.

9322
11:13:27,960 --> 11:13:29,960
Not to be confused with Azura.

9323
11:13:29,960 --> 11:13:31,960
Which is right before you finish the game.

9324
11:13:31,960 --> 11:13:32,960
Oh.

9325
11:13:33,960 --> 11:13:34,960
That seems a bit silly.

9326
11:13:34,960 --> 11:13:35,960
Do you know where you're taking us,

9327
11:13:35,960 --> 11:13:36,960
enemy recently?

9328
11:13:36,960 --> 11:13:37,960
Reeflings?

9329
11:13:39,960 --> 11:13:40,960
Does anyone...

9330
11:13:40,960 --> 11:13:41,960
Wait, we need a group huddle.

9331
11:13:41,960 --> 11:13:42,960
Reeflings, we need a group huddle.

9332
11:13:42,960 --> 11:13:43,960
Come.

9333
11:13:43,960 --> 11:13:44,960
Come.

9334
11:13:44,960 --> 11:13:45,960
Reefling, come down.

9335
11:13:45,960 --> 11:13:46,960
Come down.

9336
11:13:46,960 --> 11:13:47,960
We need a group huddle.

9337
11:13:47,960 --> 11:13:48,960
We need a group huddle.

9338
11:13:48,960 --> 11:13:49,960
Okay, let me just...

9339
11:13:49,960 --> 11:13:51,960
Where the fuck are we going?

9340
11:13:51,960 --> 11:13:52,960
I'm so lost right now.

9341
11:13:52,960 --> 11:13:55,960
I've never seen this place before.

9342
11:13:55,960 --> 11:13:56,960
Where are we going?

9343
11:14:01,960 --> 11:14:02,960
Okay, we have a torch.

9344
11:14:02,960 --> 11:14:03,960
We have a torch bearer.

9345
11:14:03,960 --> 11:14:04,960
Okay.

9346
11:14:04,960 --> 11:14:05,960
Okay, let's go.

9347
11:14:05,960 --> 11:14:06,960
Okay, we're ready.

9348
11:14:06,960 --> 11:14:07,960
We're going back.

9349
11:14:07,960 --> 11:14:08,960
We're going up a hill.

9350
11:14:08,960 --> 11:14:10,960
Okay, I need to go to bed and fall.

9351
11:14:10,960 --> 11:14:11,960
Let me put up my desk.

9352
11:14:11,960 --> 11:14:12,960
Rest well.

9353
11:14:12,960 --> 11:14:13,960
Sleep well.

9354
11:14:13,960 --> 11:14:14,960
Sleep dream.

9355
11:14:14,960 --> 11:14:15,960
Have dreams of Karen,

9356
11:14:15,960 --> 11:14:16,960
Mayo, and Elvin ring.

9357
11:14:16,960 --> 11:14:17,960
Thank you.

9358
11:14:18,960 --> 11:14:19,960
That's all I need.

9359
11:14:19,960 --> 11:14:20,960
That's all I ask for.

9360
11:14:20,960 --> 11:14:21,960
Oh.

9361
11:14:21,960 --> 11:14:22,960
Oops.

9362
11:14:23,960 --> 11:14:24,960
Hmm.

9363
11:14:25,960 --> 11:14:27,960
There's two sacred tears

9364
11:14:27,960 --> 11:14:28,960
in the realm of the giants.

9365
11:14:28,960 --> 11:14:29,960
We're better off.

9366
11:14:30,960 --> 11:14:31,960
Hmm.

9367
11:14:32,960 --> 11:14:33,960
Yes.

9368
11:14:33,960 --> 11:14:35,960
If anyone needs to go to sleep,

9369
11:14:35,960 --> 11:14:36,960
please don't worry.

9370
11:14:36,960 --> 11:14:37,960
You may go to sleep.

9371
11:14:37,960 --> 11:14:38,960
I...

9372
11:14:38,960 --> 11:14:39,960
Unfortunately,

9373
11:14:39,960 --> 11:14:40,960
we're actually against the clock

9374
11:14:40,960 --> 11:14:41,960
and we've got around 30 minutes

9375
11:14:41,960 --> 11:14:43,960
now before the vod explodes.

9376
11:14:44,960 --> 11:14:45,960
Right, on the classic

9377
11:14:45,960 --> 11:14:47,960
11 hours and 55 minutes.

9378
11:14:47,960 --> 11:14:48,960
Ka-blamel.

9379
11:14:50,960 --> 11:14:51,960
Wah.

9380
11:14:52,960 --> 11:14:53,960
Where are these?

9381
11:14:54,960 --> 11:14:55,960
Oh, they're alive?

9382
11:14:56,960 --> 11:14:58,960
Well, I don't like that one bit.

9383
11:14:58,960 --> 11:14:59,960
No, sorry.

9384
11:15:02,960 --> 11:15:03,960
Night night,

9385
11:15:03,960 --> 11:15:05,960
I will have dreams of just Karen.

9386
11:15:07,960 --> 11:15:08,960
Another refling

9387
11:15:08,960 --> 11:15:10,960
that couldn't last as long as a memory.

9388
11:15:10,960 --> 11:15:11,960
A tale is all this time.

9389
11:15:12,960 --> 11:15:13,960
Only 30 minutes.

9390
11:15:13,960 --> 11:15:15,960
Shoot, I'll crash after that then.

9391
11:15:15,960 --> 11:15:17,960
Oh no, if you need to go to sleep,

9392
11:15:17,960 --> 11:15:18,960
don't stay up

9393
11:15:18,960 --> 11:15:19,960
just because like,

9394
11:15:19,960 --> 11:15:21,960
we're only going to be 30 more minutes.

9395
11:15:22,960 --> 11:15:24,960
Over the fingering place.

9396
11:15:24,960 --> 11:15:25,960
Out of context.

9397
11:15:25,960 --> 11:15:26,960
Oh, right.

9398
11:15:26,960 --> 11:15:27,960
Okay, I get it.

9399
11:15:27,960 --> 11:15:28,960
I get it.

9400
11:15:28,960 --> 11:15:30,960
The creepiest enemy

9401
11:15:30,960 --> 11:15:31,960
in the game

9402
11:15:31,960 --> 11:15:32,960
had to have had its own

9403
11:15:32,960 --> 11:15:34,960
literal massive maze.

9404
11:15:34,960 --> 11:15:35,960
Oh.

9405
11:15:35,960 --> 11:15:36,960
I'm not a fan.

9406
11:15:36,960 --> 11:15:37,960
Well, we just run for it.

9407
11:15:37,960 --> 11:15:39,960
I think we can just run for it, right?

9408
11:15:42,960 --> 11:15:43,960
I'm just running.

9409
11:15:43,960 --> 11:15:45,960
I'm just running

9410
11:15:45,960 --> 11:15:47,960
faster than I ever had.

9411
11:15:48,960 --> 11:15:50,960
I've already lost the lookout.

9412
11:15:50,960 --> 11:15:52,960
Okay, I found the lookout.

9413
11:15:52,960 --> 11:15:54,960
He's over here a little to the right.

9414
11:15:54,960 --> 11:15:56,960
Head south side, refling.

9415
11:15:56,960 --> 11:15:57,960
South side.

9416
11:15:57,960 --> 11:15:59,960
We're still running.

9417
11:15:59,960 --> 11:16:01,960
Faster than we ever could.

9418
11:16:02,960 --> 11:16:04,960
Let in our little feet.

9419
11:16:04,960 --> 11:16:05,960
Run.

9420
11:16:05,960 --> 11:16:07,960
South side.

9421
11:16:07,960 --> 11:16:09,960
Our main plan.

9422
11:16:09,960 --> 11:16:11,960
We're still running.

9423
11:16:12,960 --> 11:16:14,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9424
11:16:16,960 --> 11:16:17,960
Where the heck?

9425
11:16:17,960 --> 11:16:19,960
I blink and gauge refling

9426
11:16:19,960 --> 11:16:20,960
always disappears.

9427
11:16:22,960 --> 11:16:23,960
Apparently the morning shift

9428
11:16:23,960 --> 11:16:24,960
is pretty quiet.

9429
11:16:24,960 --> 11:16:25,960
What did I miss?

9430
11:16:26,960 --> 11:16:28,960
Um, we're in a,

9431
11:16:28,960 --> 11:16:30,960
the fart zone apparently,

9432
11:16:30,960 --> 11:16:32,960
because everything's green.

9433
11:16:32,960 --> 11:16:34,960
I'm not sure if that,

9434
11:16:34,960 --> 11:16:36,960
is that supposed to happen?

9435
11:16:36,960 --> 11:16:38,960
We're now in the finger location

9436
11:16:38,960 --> 11:16:39,960
in the DLC.

9437
11:16:39,960 --> 11:16:40,960
No idea what it is.

9438
11:16:40,960 --> 11:16:42,960
There's something in the distance.

9439
11:16:42,960 --> 11:16:43,960
There is no way that is attacking us

9440
11:16:43,960 --> 11:16:45,960
from the distance.

9441
11:16:49,960 --> 11:16:50,960
Hello?

9442
11:16:54,960 --> 11:16:56,960
Reflings absolutely annihilate

9443
11:16:56,960 --> 11:16:58,960
that figure.

9444
11:16:58,960 --> 11:17:00,960
It wishes there's nothing but harm.

9445
11:17:01,960 --> 11:17:03,960
And we will punish it

9446
11:17:03,960 --> 11:17:05,960
for its transgression.

9447
11:17:05,960 --> 11:17:06,960
Oh my God, they can do it

9448
11:17:06,960 --> 11:17:08,960
all from halfway across the map.

9449
11:17:08,960 --> 11:17:09,960
Hello?

9450
11:17:09,960 --> 11:17:10,960
Oh!

9451
11:17:12,960 --> 11:17:13,960
Okay, take that.

9452
11:17:13,960 --> 11:17:14,960
No poise.

9453
11:17:14,960 --> 11:17:15,960
No stamina.

9454
11:17:15,960 --> 11:17:17,960
No nothing going through it.

9455
11:17:17,960 --> 11:17:18,960
Don't,

9456
11:17:18,960 --> 11:17:20,960
from halfway across the map.

9457
11:17:20,960 --> 11:17:21,960
Right, do be careful.

9458
11:17:21,960 --> 11:17:22,960
Be vigilant.

9459
11:17:22,960 --> 11:17:24,960
I don't know what the purple does.

9460
11:17:24,960 --> 11:17:26,960
Oh, there's two more group top over here.

9461
11:17:27,960 --> 11:17:29,960
Did we just keep running?

9462
11:17:30,960 --> 11:17:32,960
Honestly, your side step is pretty good.

9463
11:17:32,960 --> 11:17:34,960
I won't, I won't admit.

9464
11:17:34,960 --> 11:17:36,960
Your side step is pretty good.

9465
11:17:36,960 --> 11:17:38,960
Okay, it's like a purple bomb.

9466
11:17:43,960 --> 11:17:45,960
Oh my God, it's spit-file.

9467
11:17:45,960 --> 11:17:46,960
It's spit-file.

9468
11:17:46,960 --> 11:17:47,960
Of course it's spit-file.

9469
11:17:47,960 --> 11:17:48,960
Why wouldn't I spit-file?

9470
11:17:48,960 --> 11:17:50,960
Oh, I'm out of stamina.

9471
11:17:51,960 --> 11:17:54,960
Okay, thank goodness.

9472
11:17:54,960 --> 11:17:56,960
They can just get staggered beyond belief.

9473
11:17:56,960 --> 11:17:58,960
Sorry, but this DLC,

9474
11:17:58,960 --> 11:18:00,960
everything seems to be staggerable

9475
11:18:00,960 --> 11:18:01,960
for the most part,

9476
11:18:01,960 --> 11:18:03,960
which just makes it so worth it

9477
11:18:03,960 --> 11:18:06,960
to be like two-handed heavy.

9478
11:18:06,960 --> 11:18:08,960
Alright, feels like that anyway.

9479
11:18:08,960 --> 11:18:10,960
That's just me, honestly.

9480
11:18:10,960 --> 11:18:11,960
I've just made,

9481
11:18:11,960 --> 11:18:12,960
oh jeez Louise,

9482
11:18:12,960 --> 11:18:13,960
something got me good.

9483
11:18:13,960 --> 11:18:14,960
I don't know what,

9484
11:18:14,960 --> 11:18:16,960
unless it was that one.

9485
11:18:16,960 --> 11:18:19,960
My brain literally couldn't process it.

9486
11:18:19,960 --> 11:18:22,960
We've got a finger mimic.

9487
11:18:26,960 --> 11:18:28,960
But what point in the DLC are we at?

9488
11:18:28,960 --> 11:18:29,960
That's the fun part.

9489
11:18:29,960 --> 11:18:31,960
I know nothing of the DLC,

9490
11:18:31,960 --> 11:18:34,960
so I can't even accurately give anything.

9491
11:18:34,960 --> 11:18:35,960
This is what the map looks like.

9492
11:18:35,960 --> 11:18:38,960
We're now in the fingery part of the map.

9493
11:18:38,960 --> 11:18:40,960
That's the best I've got.

9494
11:18:40,960 --> 11:18:42,960
This used to be some sort of

9495
11:18:42,960 --> 11:18:45,960
totem type thing.

9496
11:18:45,960 --> 11:18:47,960
I'll touch it in a teleport maybe?

9497
11:18:49,960 --> 11:18:51,960
Read the message.

9498
11:18:51,960 --> 11:18:52,960
What did I do?

9499
11:18:52,960 --> 11:18:53,960
Read the message.

9500
11:18:53,960 --> 11:18:54,960
I did it.

9501
11:18:54,960 --> 11:18:56,960
Time to finger.

9502
11:19:02,960 --> 11:19:04,960
I'm not built like I wanted to

9503
11:19:04,960 --> 11:19:07,960
draw for like a bug or something.

9504
11:19:07,960 --> 11:19:08,960
No, you can.

9505
11:19:08,960 --> 11:19:09,960
You are free to lurk,

9506
11:19:09,960 --> 11:19:10,960
you're free to chat,

9507
11:19:10,960 --> 11:19:12,960
and whatever is your comfort level.

9508
11:19:12,960 --> 11:19:15,960
Can I not interact with you guys here?

9509
11:19:15,960 --> 11:19:18,960
Or do I need to do something?

9510
11:19:19,960 --> 11:19:21,960
Do I stick my...

9511
11:19:21,960 --> 11:19:23,960
Well, you know, what on earth?

9512
11:19:23,960 --> 11:19:25,960
But rest well for those who need to sleep.

9513
11:19:25,960 --> 11:19:28,960
You need a special item for a quest.

9514
11:19:30,960 --> 11:19:31,960
Word of warning,

9515
11:19:31,960 --> 11:19:33,960
if you ever go to the church of eclipse,

9516
11:19:33,960 --> 11:19:34,960
you will be jumpscared.

9517
11:19:34,960 --> 11:19:36,960
Okay, thank you for letting me know.

9518
11:19:40,960 --> 11:19:43,960
I need an item of some kind.

9519
11:19:44,960 --> 11:19:47,960
Is that my fingy?

9520
11:19:47,960 --> 11:19:50,960
Did you talk to the guy in a church on a throne?

9521
11:19:50,960 --> 11:19:53,960
No.

9522
11:19:53,960 --> 11:19:55,960
I don't think so.

9523
11:20:01,960 --> 11:20:03,960
Am I supposed to?

9524
11:20:12,960 --> 11:20:13,960
Go get an item.

9525
11:20:13,960 --> 11:20:14,960
I gotta go.

9526
11:20:14,960 --> 11:20:16,960
Thanks for this yappies.

9527
11:20:16,960 --> 11:20:18,960
You're more than welcome, please rest well.

9528
11:20:18,960 --> 11:20:20,960
Do what you gotta do.

9529
11:20:20,960 --> 11:20:21,960
It's a finger.

9530
11:20:21,960 --> 11:20:22,960
I think you don't stick something in it.

9531
11:20:22,960 --> 11:20:25,960
You must likely do the opposite.

9532
11:20:25,960 --> 11:20:30,960
Back to manage my tire with you.

9533
11:20:30,960 --> 11:20:31,960
Okay.

9534
11:20:44,960 --> 11:20:45,960
Oh wait, sorry.

9535
11:20:45,960 --> 11:20:46,960
Everyone taught me.

9536
11:20:46,960 --> 11:20:48,960
Was it mana?

9537
11:20:48,960 --> 11:20:49,960
Me.

9538
11:20:49,960 --> 11:20:51,960
Wait, mo?

9539
11:20:51,960 --> 11:20:54,960
Wait, I don't have it?

9540
11:20:54,960 --> 11:20:57,960
Left of where you are in blue.

9541
11:20:58,960 --> 11:21:00,960
Ah, that's right.

9542
11:21:00,960 --> 11:21:02,960
Wait, I can't.

9543
11:21:02,960 --> 11:21:03,960
Oh, sorry.

9544
11:21:03,960 --> 11:21:05,960
Reefling is okay if you leave.

9545
11:21:05,960 --> 11:21:07,960
That can go teleporting.

9546
11:21:07,960 --> 11:21:09,960
To the left, there's a...

9547
11:21:09,960 --> 11:21:11,960
I don't think I need to fight though.

9548
11:21:11,960 --> 11:21:13,960
Wait, am I gonna have to come all the way back here then?

9549
11:21:13,960 --> 11:21:15,960
Am I just gonna come back here and horseback the first time?

9550
11:21:15,960 --> 11:21:17,960
Do that then.

9551
11:21:18,960 --> 11:21:20,960
Oh, it's been a pleasure.

9552
11:21:20,960 --> 11:21:22,960
Woo-hoo!

9553
11:21:26,960 --> 11:21:27,960
No?

9554
11:21:27,960 --> 11:21:28,960
Okay.

9555
11:21:28,960 --> 11:21:30,960
There's a man in here to speak to.

9556
11:21:30,960 --> 11:21:32,960
And there's no fight in here.

9557
11:21:32,960 --> 11:21:33,960
Don't...

9558
11:21:33,960 --> 11:21:34,960
There's no fight.

9559
11:21:34,960 --> 11:21:35,960
I know the area is safe.

9560
11:21:35,960 --> 11:21:39,960
I don't have to be absolutely terrified.

9561
11:21:39,960 --> 11:21:41,960
Fucking hell it's dark in here.

9562
11:21:41,960 --> 11:21:44,960
I'm fucking breaking it.

9563
11:21:44,960 --> 11:21:45,960
Okay.

9564
11:21:46,960 --> 11:21:48,960
Please don't be a fight.

9565
11:21:48,960 --> 11:21:50,960
Please don't be a fight.

9566
11:21:50,960 --> 11:21:52,960
Please don't be a fight.

9567
11:21:52,960 --> 11:21:54,960
Please don't be a fight.

9568
11:21:54,960 --> 11:21:56,960
Please don't be a fight.

9569
11:21:56,960 --> 11:21:58,960
Oh, there's blood everywhere!

9570
11:21:58,960 --> 11:21:59,960
Reefling!

9571
11:22:02,960 --> 11:22:04,960
There's literally blood everywhere.

9572
11:22:04,960 --> 11:22:05,960
No!

9573
11:22:05,960 --> 11:22:07,960
No, you can't do this to me.

9574
11:22:07,960 --> 11:22:10,960
I'm exhausted and you want me to fight?

9575
11:22:11,960 --> 11:22:13,960
Oh, there's blood everywhere.

9576
11:22:13,960 --> 11:22:15,960
Where's the enemy?

9577
11:22:15,960 --> 11:22:19,960
It's not all a lock and onto an enemy.

9578
11:22:19,960 --> 11:22:21,960
You gotta fuck up his shit.

9579
11:22:21,960 --> 11:22:22,960
Fuck up his shit.

9580
11:22:22,960 --> 11:22:23,960
Fuck up his shit.

9581
11:22:23,960 --> 11:22:25,960
Please, let me speak to you and give me a finger or something.

9582
11:22:25,960 --> 11:22:26,960
Hello?

9583
11:22:26,960 --> 11:22:28,960
Well, we don't often receive visitors.

9584
11:22:28,960 --> 11:22:31,960
No, apparently you killed them all the way down the floor.

9585
11:22:31,960 --> 11:22:33,960
Welcome to Manus Meta.

9586
11:22:33,960 --> 11:22:35,960
It is a pleasure to have you.

9587
11:22:35,960 --> 11:22:37,960
Oh, give me your finger or whatever.

9588
11:22:37,960 --> 11:22:39,960
You are so forsaken as these.

9589
11:22:39,960 --> 11:22:42,960
Chance encounters are precious indeed.

9590
11:22:42,960 --> 11:22:45,960
Seeing that we have convened here on this day,

9591
11:22:45,960 --> 11:22:50,960
allow me to mark the occasion with a modest offering.

9592
11:22:52,960 --> 11:22:53,960
Okay.

9593
11:22:57,960 --> 11:22:59,960
Okay, get me the hell out of here.

9594
11:23:01,960 --> 11:23:03,960
Why is there death in there?

9595
11:23:05,960 --> 11:23:07,960
Why are people dying in there?

9596
11:23:07,960 --> 11:23:09,960
Did they attack him?

9597
11:23:09,960 --> 11:23:11,960
And he absolutely walloped them?

9598
11:23:11,960 --> 11:23:12,960
Right.

9599
11:23:12,960 --> 11:23:15,960
I'm just going to speed run through this area because

9600
11:23:15,960 --> 11:23:17,960
we've already checked if we're clear to that.

9601
11:23:18,960 --> 11:23:20,960
Oh, it's a mama finger and all her little...

9602
11:23:20,960 --> 11:23:22,960
Oh, and it's Papa's finger.

9603
11:23:22,960 --> 11:23:25,960
God, you guys fucking breathe like nothing on Earth.

9604
11:23:25,960 --> 11:23:26,960
You need to get our tubes shot.

9605
11:23:26,960 --> 11:23:27,960
Holy shit.

9606
11:23:28,960 --> 11:23:30,960
Do you know like after the third child,

9607
11:23:30,960 --> 11:23:32,960
it gets really irresponsible?

9608
11:23:35,960 --> 11:23:36,960
They're just going to school.

9609
11:23:36,960 --> 11:23:38,960
Okay, they're just going to school.

9610
11:23:39,960 --> 11:23:42,960
Wow, I can't see nothing.

9611
11:23:48,960 --> 11:23:51,960
I guess you could see the finger bit.

9612
11:23:53,960 --> 11:23:54,960
Oh, thank you.

9613
11:23:54,960 --> 11:23:56,960
Oh, I just dropped my piece of paper that has

9614
11:23:56,960 --> 11:23:58,960
everyone's name on it over here.

9615
11:24:08,960 --> 11:24:09,960
Okay.

9616
11:24:14,960 --> 11:24:17,960
Aw, Reflin's leave me for literally five seconds

9617
11:24:17,960 --> 11:24:20,960
and I'm in an utter, like utter disarray.

9618
11:24:20,960 --> 11:24:22,960
Utter disarray.

9619
11:24:22,960 --> 11:24:24,960
Utter dis, the fucking...

9620
11:24:32,960 --> 11:24:35,960
I will call you guys in and you can hold my hand

9621
11:24:35,960 --> 11:24:37,960
down to where I need to go.

9622
11:24:39,960 --> 11:24:41,960
Oh, of course.

9623
11:24:41,960 --> 11:24:44,960
Oh, of course, I can't just walk down.

9624
11:24:45,960 --> 11:24:47,960
Oh, I'm looking so bad at the game.

9625
11:24:49,960 --> 11:24:51,960
Oh, sorry.

9626
11:24:51,960 --> 11:24:53,960
Serves you right for your lame joke.

9627
11:24:53,960 --> 11:24:55,960
It was one of your jokes.

9628
11:24:56,960 --> 11:24:58,960
A Reflin joke.

9629
11:24:59,960 --> 11:25:02,960
Literally, the one time I don't get my hand held down,

9630
11:25:02,960 --> 11:25:05,960
I immediately get fucking...

9631
11:25:06,960 --> 11:25:09,960
And absolutely obliterated in the skyline.

9632
11:25:10,960 --> 11:25:12,960
Why do they always put something weird in these games?

9633
11:25:12,960 --> 11:25:15,960
Oh, they can't even handle it, honestly.

9634
11:25:17,960 --> 11:25:20,960
It was my joke and it was funny.

9635
11:25:20,960 --> 11:25:22,960
Yeah, that's why I stole it.

9636
11:25:25,960 --> 11:25:28,960
Is there any other Reflin that's able to guide me

9637
11:25:28,960 --> 11:25:30,960
through fingerstone hell?

9638
11:25:31,960 --> 11:25:33,960
Fingerstone hell?

9639
11:25:33,960 --> 11:25:35,960
Barely even nor.

9640
11:25:35,960 --> 11:25:37,960
Sorry, fingerstone?

9641
11:25:37,960 --> 11:25:39,960
That's hardly even.

9642
11:25:39,960 --> 11:25:41,960
Doesn't make anything.

9643
11:25:41,960 --> 11:25:43,960
God, they're so pretty.

9644
11:25:44,960 --> 11:25:46,960
Why are they getting closer to us?

9645
11:25:46,960 --> 11:25:48,960
Reflin that spawned in?

9646
11:25:48,960 --> 11:25:50,960
Just be careful, they're getting a bit close.

9647
11:25:50,960 --> 11:25:52,960
It's locked onto you, Reflin.

9648
11:25:54,960 --> 11:25:56,960
I think it's locked onto you.

9649
11:25:56,960 --> 11:25:58,960
I think we're about to get pummeled by this.

9650
11:25:58,960 --> 11:26:00,960
Okay, he's ready.

9651
11:26:00,960 --> 11:26:03,960
With the powerful aura of the Reflin,

9652
11:26:03,960 --> 11:26:06,960
they retreat for his stamina,

9653
11:26:06,960 --> 11:26:09,960
his menacing aura is just far too much

9654
11:26:09,960 --> 11:26:11,960
for the game to handle.

9655
11:26:13,960 --> 11:26:15,960
It checks out, it's checking out.

9656
11:26:15,960 --> 11:26:17,960
Look at him, he's sizing up the Reflin.

9657
11:26:17,960 --> 11:26:18,960
What does he say?

9658
11:26:18,960 --> 11:26:20,960
He's thinking about it,

9659
11:26:20,960 --> 11:26:22,960
he thinks about challenging the Reflin,

9660
11:26:22,960 --> 11:26:25,960
but is he going to make a mistake of his life?

9661
11:26:25,960 --> 11:26:27,960
He's going to make the mistake of his life,

9662
11:26:27,960 --> 11:26:29,960
he couldn't help it.

9663
11:26:29,960 --> 11:26:31,960
It's too much.

9664
11:26:31,960 --> 11:26:33,960
It's overwhelming, truly.

9665
11:26:35,960 --> 11:26:38,960
Oh, he regretted it, he regretted it.

9666
11:26:38,960 --> 11:26:41,960
He underestimated the Reflin,

9667
11:26:41,960 --> 11:26:43,960
and now he's gone.

9668
11:26:43,960 --> 11:26:45,960
Back to the urge tree with you.

9669
11:26:45,960 --> 11:26:47,960
Finger papa is dead.

9670
11:26:47,960 --> 11:26:49,960
Sorry, he was asking for it, that's for Hansy.

9671
11:26:50,960 --> 11:26:52,960
Can you have too much testosterone,

9672
11:26:52,960 --> 11:26:54,960
you think you rule the world?

9673
11:26:55,960 --> 11:26:58,960
Right, how the fuck do we get past them?

9674
11:26:58,960 --> 11:27:00,960
Oh wait, we can run past these ones, can't we?

9675
11:27:00,960 --> 11:27:02,960
They can't keep up.

9676
11:27:03,960 --> 11:27:05,960
I think we can just run past.

9677
11:27:05,960 --> 11:27:07,960
Are we just destroying the entire bloodline?

9678
11:27:07,960 --> 11:27:09,960
Okay, nah, just walk past them.

9679
11:27:09,960 --> 11:27:11,960
My weapon's too shit.

9680
11:27:12,960 --> 11:27:15,960
I need to help with the wiggly worms, really.

9681
11:27:16,960 --> 11:27:18,960
Oh shit, the Reflin's getting gang banged.

9682
11:27:18,960 --> 11:27:20,960
Oh no, he's getting Reflin run.

9683
11:27:20,960 --> 11:27:22,960
Do you have enough heals?

9684
11:27:22,960 --> 11:27:24,960
Yeah, you're good.

9685
11:27:25,960 --> 11:27:28,960
It's the worms that we need to be worried about, honestly.

9686
11:27:28,960 --> 11:27:32,960
Look at that little fire barrier.

9687
11:27:32,960 --> 11:27:35,960
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, see that hand?

9688
11:27:35,960 --> 11:27:38,960
Just run past, just run past, we have stamina.

9689
11:27:41,960 --> 11:27:43,960
Because the mummy...

9690
11:27:43,960 --> 11:27:46,960
This Reflin said nah, it's personal,

9691
11:27:46,960 --> 11:27:49,960
you don't ever do that to me, you jumping me like that?

9692
11:27:50,960 --> 11:27:53,960
Hands, F around and found out, what's going on?

9693
11:27:53,960 --> 11:27:56,960
I remember the first time I found a finger hand monster,

9694
11:27:56,960 --> 11:27:58,960
I think my neighbors also remember that.

9695
11:28:00,960 --> 11:28:03,960
Right, this is the part where I got fricking jumped

9696
11:28:03,960 --> 11:28:06,960
by like a whole gang of worms.

9697
11:28:07,960 --> 11:28:10,960
I need to be careful of those fricking pulsing bombs.

9698
11:28:10,960 --> 11:28:12,960
I wish I had like the lightning strike magic,

9699
11:28:12,960 --> 11:28:14,960
where you can like fire...

9700
11:28:14,960 --> 11:28:16,960
Is it like Zeus? I think it's Zeus.

9701
11:28:17,960 --> 11:28:19,960
Yeah, that...

9702
11:28:20,960 --> 11:28:23,960
Basically do it for like how far away?

9703
11:28:23,960 --> 11:28:25,960
That's not even for me, I'm getting nervous.

9704
11:28:27,960 --> 11:28:29,960
I don't know if I just need to do the magic one.

9705
11:28:30,960 --> 11:28:33,960
I need my Glyx one, I thought that was coming for me.

9706
11:28:33,960 --> 11:28:35,960
Really got handed to the Reflins?

9707
11:28:35,960 --> 11:28:38,960
Well, from how good they are at like holding my hand.

9708
11:28:38,960 --> 11:28:40,960
I'll get you out of there.

9709
11:28:40,960 --> 11:28:42,960
Whoa, they spawn in on you!

9710
11:28:42,960 --> 11:28:44,960
No, I'm just going to save you!

9711
11:28:47,960 --> 11:28:50,960
What happened?

9712
11:28:50,960 --> 11:28:53,960
How did we do it so perfectly last time?

9713
11:28:57,960 --> 11:29:00,960
If you get caught by that fucking pink thing,

9714
11:29:00,960 --> 11:29:03,960
these ones can just spawn over to you?

9715
11:29:04,960 --> 11:29:06,960
Oh no, I got caught!

9716
11:29:06,960 --> 11:29:08,960
Wait, I can still roll though.

9717
11:29:09,960 --> 11:29:11,960
Oh my god.

9718
11:29:12,960 --> 11:29:14,960
That's outrageous!

9719
11:29:15,960 --> 11:29:17,960
So hard for no reason.

9720
11:29:17,960 --> 11:29:19,960
No, didn't you bother me?

9721
11:29:19,960 --> 11:29:21,960
Fucking cheeky wee shit.

9722
11:29:21,960 --> 11:29:23,960
Honestly, I'm out of stamina on everyone.

9723
11:29:23,960 --> 11:29:25,960
Grab someone else you wee fucking wee.

9724
11:29:25,960 --> 11:29:27,960
Weirdo.

9725
11:29:28,960 --> 11:29:30,960
I better go right through me.

9726
11:29:30,960 --> 11:29:32,960
I'm not having that.

9727
11:29:33,960 --> 11:29:35,960
Oh, it's a Paralysm scale.

9728
11:29:35,960 --> 11:29:37,960
It's me! I'm Paralysm.

9729
11:29:37,960 --> 11:29:39,960
Oh shit, are we healing?

9730
11:29:39,960 --> 11:29:41,960
Oh no, I'm not healing.

9731
11:29:41,960 --> 11:29:43,960
Okay, let's be up these worms and then we're there.

9732
11:29:44,960 --> 11:29:47,960
I think this one's already locked on to us.

9733
11:29:47,960 --> 11:29:49,960
It is. It's just been a wee liar.

9734
11:29:49,960 --> 11:29:51,960
Yeah, they're both locked on to us.

9735
11:29:51,960 --> 11:29:54,960
It's just pretending to not be locked on.

9736
11:29:59,960 --> 11:30:01,960
There we go.

9737
11:30:01,960 --> 11:30:03,960
A liar.

9738
11:30:03,960 --> 11:30:05,960
Is that one locked on to us?

9739
11:30:05,960 --> 11:30:08,960
It looks like it. Yeah, it's locked on.

9740
11:30:08,960 --> 11:30:10,960
Time to go at nine o'clock.

9741
11:30:11,960 --> 11:30:13,960
There we go.

9742
11:30:16,960 --> 11:30:18,960
Look at my survivability percentages.

9743
11:30:18,960 --> 11:30:20,960
Go up when I've got refunds.

9744
11:30:20,960 --> 11:30:22,960
It's amazing.

9745
11:30:22,960 --> 11:30:24,960
I did this all myself.

9746
11:30:24,960 --> 11:30:26,960
Smile.

9747
11:30:26,960 --> 11:30:28,960
I've never seen them do it.

9748
11:30:28,960 --> 11:30:30,960
I love how we're doing that harder.

9749
11:30:30,960 --> 11:30:33,960
Hands in this area is a bit touchy.

9750
11:30:33,960 --> 11:30:35,960
Finger ruin is finger ruin.

9751
11:30:35,960 --> 11:30:37,960
Either way, it's getting done.

9752
11:30:37,960 --> 11:30:42,960
Okay, now I can do what I need to do at this area.

9753
11:30:42,960 --> 11:30:44,960
Can I do it while you guys are present?

9754
11:30:44,960 --> 11:30:46,960
Yes, I can.

9755
11:30:48,960 --> 11:30:50,960
Oh, it's a horn.

9756
11:30:52,960 --> 11:30:54,960
What does that do?

9757
11:30:55,960 --> 11:30:58,960
A cerulean seat talisman.

9758
11:30:58,960 --> 11:31:00,960
I don't know.

9759
11:31:05,960 --> 11:31:07,960
You don't...

9760
11:31:07,960 --> 11:31:09,960
Why am I not being told my stats?

9761
11:31:09,960 --> 11:31:11,960
What does it do?

9762
11:31:11,960 --> 11:31:13,960
I don't know.

9763
11:31:15,960 --> 11:31:17,960
These are where all the fingers that get lost go.

9764
11:31:17,960 --> 11:31:19,960
Well, at least they have a horn.

9765
11:31:19,960 --> 11:31:22,960
Wait, why is it that it's not telling what it lost?

9766
11:31:22,960 --> 11:31:24,960
How strange. Am I going crazy?

9767
11:31:24,960 --> 11:31:26,960
A little bit.

9768
11:31:26,960 --> 11:31:28,960
Greatly boost magic.

9769
11:31:28,960 --> 11:31:30,960
Oh, well...

9770
11:31:37,960 --> 11:31:39,960
Right, so we got our finger talisman.

9771
11:31:39,960 --> 11:31:42,960
We've been through the flowers.

9772
11:31:42,960 --> 11:31:47,960
We've also been through this incredibly crazy path.

9773
11:31:51,960 --> 11:31:54,960
Oh, there's another finger city?

9774
11:31:57,960 --> 11:31:59,960
Oh, I thought we did it.

9775
11:32:00,960 --> 11:32:02,960
There's more fingers?

9776
11:32:04,960 --> 11:32:06,960
Hey, when you go back to the church,

9777
11:32:06,960 --> 11:32:09,960
there's another NPC leaning up against the pillar to the right

9778
11:32:09,960 --> 11:32:11,960
that you should go back to the same church.

9779
11:32:11,960 --> 11:32:13,960
Okay, Riesling, thank you for insisting me all this way.

9780
11:32:13,960 --> 11:32:17,960
I don't know why I got so banged up, like, going on my own,

9781
11:32:17,960 --> 11:32:19,960
but honestly, just proof that I need you guys.

9782
11:32:19,960 --> 11:32:22,960
Thank you so much for helping me get here.

9783
11:32:22,960 --> 11:32:23,960
Hope that helps.

9784
11:32:23,960 --> 11:32:25,960
Dangerous again, honestly.

9785
11:32:28,960 --> 11:32:30,960
Okay, and then there's someone...

9786
11:32:30,960 --> 11:32:33,960
Go back to the church, there's an NPC leaning on the right

9787
11:32:33,960 --> 11:32:36,960
that I need to talk to in order to...

9788
11:32:36,960 --> 11:32:38,960
How much time have I got?

9789
11:32:38,960 --> 11:32:41,960
I've only got less than 5 minutes.

9790
11:32:41,960 --> 11:32:43,960
We're responding.

9791
11:32:43,960 --> 11:32:46,960
NPC to the right in this room?

9792
11:32:46,960 --> 11:32:48,960
Okay.

9793
11:32:52,960 --> 11:32:54,960
Man, I can't see shit, I need my glakes on.

9794
11:32:54,960 --> 11:32:56,960
Oh, crap.

9795
11:32:56,960 --> 11:32:57,960
Oh, there you are.

9796
11:32:57,960 --> 11:32:59,960
Sorry, couldn't see you there again.

9797
11:32:59,960 --> 11:33:00,960
Hi.

9798
11:33:17,960 --> 11:33:19,960
Anything else?

9799
11:33:22,960 --> 11:33:24,960
Are you sure?

9800
11:33:26,960 --> 11:33:29,960
Hey, I got, like, this talisman thing, do you want it back?

9801
11:33:29,960 --> 11:33:31,960
It's not really mine.

9802
11:33:47,960 --> 11:33:49,960
It's like a thing.

9803
11:34:01,960 --> 11:34:03,960
Oh, I did it the wrong way.

9804
11:34:06,960 --> 11:34:08,960
Wait, man, idiot, did I get the wrong...

9805
11:34:11,960 --> 11:34:13,960
Am I a dum-dum?

9806
11:34:14,960 --> 11:34:16,960
Ask about the name Black Armor.

9807
11:34:30,960 --> 11:34:33,960
Do they have time to do the other thing, you rune?

9808
11:34:33,960 --> 11:34:35,960
You think?

9809
11:34:35,960 --> 11:34:37,960
Okay.

9810
11:34:42,960 --> 11:34:44,960
Okay.

9811
11:34:44,960 --> 11:34:47,960
Okay, I'll move on, how do I get there?

9812
11:34:47,960 --> 11:34:49,960
This one?

9813
11:34:50,960 --> 11:34:53,960
Why would it give me a map?

9814
11:34:58,960 --> 11:35:00,960
It's not even highlighted.

9815
11:35:00,960 --> 11:35:02,960
Why go through these animals to school?

9816
11:35:02,960 --> 11:35:04,960
Ooh, enjoying it.

9817
11:35:04,960 --> 11:35:07,960
I'm exhausted, but, like, I can't get enough.

9818
11:35:07,960 --> 11:35:10,960
I was, I said, like, fucking, at the start of the stream,

9819
11:35:10,960 --> 11:35:12,960
I was like, this isn't going to be an endurance stream.

9820
11:35:12,960 --> 11:35:14,960
At six hours in, I was like, am I going to go off soon?

9821
11:35:14,960 --> 11:35:16,960
Eight hours in, am I going to go off soon?

9822
11:35:16,960 --> 11:35:18,960
We need to actually go off in 20 minutes

9823
11:35:18,960 --> 11:35:20,960
because the board's going to explode.

9824
11:35:20,960 --> 11:35:22,960
Check the papers from the inventory.

9825
11:35:35,960 --> 11:35:37,960
Examine using X.

9826
11:35:37,960 --> 11:35:39,960
Well, I can't fucking see it.

9827
11:35:39,960 --> 11:35:41,960
So, do you want to try again?

9828
11:35:41,960 --> 11:35:43,960
Switch view.

9829
11:35:45,960 --> 11:35:46,960
Switch display.

9830
11:35:46,960 --> 11:35:48,960
Are you trolling me right now?

9831
11:35:54,960 --> 11:35:55,960
Will you start a second stream?

9832
11:35:55,960 --> 11:35:57,960
No, it's my bedtime for me, sadly.

9833
11:35:58,960 --> 11:36:00,960
Um...

9834
11:36:00,960 --> 11:36:01,960
Am I being trolled?

9835
11:36:01,960 --> 11:36:03,960
No, that's fine.

9836
11:36:03,960 --> 11:36:05,960
I'm being trolled, and I'll literally not look at that figure.

9837
11:36:05,960 --> 11:36:07,960
Surely I can.

9838
11:36:07,960 --> 11:36:09,960
Select an item to interact with it.

9839
11:36:09,960 --> 11:36:12,960
A, use leave discard.

9840
11:36:12,960 --> 11:36:14,960
Okay, now make it bigger

9841
11:36:14,960 --> 11:36:16,960
so I can actually read the damn thing.

9842
11:36:18,960 --> 11:36:20,960
Are you fucking joking?

9843
11:36:20,960 --> 11:36:23,960
Like, I know it's down there, but, like, are you serious?

9844
11:36:23,960 --> 11:36:25,960
Are you trolled?

9845
11:36:27,960 --> 11:36:29,960
That's all you can see.

9846
11:36:29,960 --> 11:36:32,960
The game won't even, like, I know it's here,

9847
11:36:32,960 --> 11:36:34,960
but...

9848
11:36:34,960 --> 11:36:35,960
Wait, how do I get down there?

9849
11:36:35,960 --> 11:36:38,960
Can you just put a bridge here?

9850
11:36:38,960 --> 11:36:41,960
So, really, in close?

9851
11:36:41,960 --> 11:36:43,960
What? Go...

9852
11:36:46,960 --> 11:36:48,960
Okay.

9853
11:36:49,960 --> 11:36:52,960
We may have to explode operations, however,

9854
11:36:52,960 --> 11:36:55,960
because I don't know how much time's going to take.

9855
11:36:55,960 --> 11:36:57,960
Gee, I wonder where it's close.

9856
11:36:57,960 --> 11:36:59,960
Ah, truly a mystery.

9857
11:37:00,960 --> 11:37:02,960
I'm out on my own.

9858
11:37:02,960 --> 11:37:04,960
You'll see such things.

9859
11:37:04,960 --> 11:37:06,960
You'll see such horrible things to me.

9860
11:37:06,960 --> 11:37:08,960
Does that have to do with someone who's a big girl?

9861
11:37:08,960 --> 11:37:10,960
I assume, what, if I go around,

9862
11:37:10,960 --> 11:37:13,960
and then there's a walk, walk, and then...

9863
11:37:13,960 --> 11:37:15,960
a walk?

9864
11:37:17,960 --> 11:37:19,960
I'd have watched what I've been playing all day.

9865
11:37:19,960 --> 11:37:21,960
Honestly, me, though.

9866
11:37:21,960 --> 11:37:23,960
I've got my thing down.

9867
11:37:23,960 --> 11:37:25,960
Oh, no, I can't lose you then.

9868
11:37:25,960 --> 11:37:27,960
Tomorrow's Elden Ring, yeah, tomorrow's another Elden Ring,

9869
11:37:27,960 --> 11:37:31,960
and then I don't know what we're going to achieve tomorrow.

9870
11:37:31,960 --> 11:37:33,960
Um...

9871
11:37:33,960 --> 11:37:34,960
Oh, there's a bee weeping.

9872
11:37:34,960 --> 11:37:36,960
Uh, Rusyn...

9873
11:37:36,960 --> 11:37:38,960
Who's...

9874
11:37:38,960 --> 11:37:39,960
Who's been...

9875
11:37:39,960 --> 11:37:41,960
Who's the last time?

9876
11:37:41,960 --> 11:37:44,960
Shilinfin, did I have you in at the horror?

9877
11:37:44,960 --> 11:37:46,960
I don't know, though.

9878
11:37:47,960 --> 11:37:50,960
Um, I'm so sorry if I'm, like, avoiding...

9879
11:37:50,960 --> 11:37:52,960
by accident.

9880
11:37:52,960 --> 11:37:55,960
Rusyn, I've been seeing you at the floor.

9881
11:37:56,960 --> 11:37:58,960
I can't remember until...

9882
11:37:58,960 --> 11:38:00,960
Are you playing on PC?

9883
11:38:00,960 --> 11:38:03,960
Yes, it's PC, and then you can stream snipe, uh, technically,

9884
11:38:03,960 --> 11:38:06,960
due to, um...

9885
11:38:08,960 --> 11:38:11,960
holding my hands to the game.

9886
11:38:11,960 --> 11:38:13,960
Uh...

9887
11:38:15,960 --> 11:38:17,960
I'm itching my face.

9888
11:38:17,960 --> 11:38:19,960
I'm itching my weeping.

9889
11:38:19,960 --> 11:38:21,960
Uh, actually, I'm going to have to thank someone to redirect.

9890
11:38:21,960 --> 11:38:23,960
Thanks for the second.

9891
11:38:23,960 --> 11:38:25,960
You guys are going to take me to the worms.

9892
11:38:25,960 --> 11:38:27,960
We're going to do the worm, go back to the church,

9893
11:38:27,960 --> 11:38:29,960
and we're going to do it in under 10 minutes,

9894
11:38:29,960 --> 11:38:33,960
so I have enough time to redirect into, uh, a lovely strumming, okay?

9895
11:38:33,960 --> 11:38:35,960
Maybe someone from Yumi Plus is on right now.

9896
11:38:35,960 --> 11:38:37,960
Go ahead.

9897
11:38:37,960 --> 11:38:39,960
It's tomorrow stream, the last time you play Elden Ring.

9898
11:38:39,960 --> 11:38:42,960
I don't know when the DLC ends,

9899
11:38:42,960 --> 11:38:44,960
like, because we're...

9900
11:38:44,960 --> 11:38:47,960
I'm kind of getting my hand held through, like, everything at the moment.

9901
11:38:47,960 --> 11:38:51,960
Um, tomorrow I'm going to upgrade weaponry, um...

9902
11:38:51,960 --> 11:38:53,960
and just keep going.

9903
11:38:53,960 --> 11:38:55,960
I don't know what we're doing.

9904
11:38:55,960 --> 11:38:57,960
I've never played the DLC before.

9905
11:38:57,960 --> 11:38:59,960
But I'm just enjoying it.

9906
11:38:59,960 --> 11:39:01,960
Like, it's so pretty,

9907
11:39:01,960 --> 11:39:03,960
and it's so nice, like, being able to enjoy it

9908
11:39:03,960 --> 11:39:05,960
and not be like, ah, I can't move.

9909
11:39:05,960 --> 11:39:07,960
What the heck?

9910
11:39:10,960 --> 11:39:12,960
We'll pick you up later.

9911
11:39:12,960 --> 11:39:14,960
We'll pick you up later.

9912
11:39:14,960 --> 11:39:16,960
What the heck?

9913
11:39:17,960 --> 11:39:22,960
Hello?

9914
11:39:22,960 --> 11:39:26,960
That just electrified you alive in your metal armor.

9915
11:39:26,960 --> 11:39:28,960
Oh, my gosh.

9916
11:39:30,960 --> 11:39:34,960
Why is this game so unforgiven?

9917
11:39:34,960 --> 11:39:36,960
Oh.

9918
11:39:36,960 --> 11:39:38,960
Whoa, there's a rolling ram, by the way, by the...

9919
11:39:38,960 --> 11:39:40,960
You just got annihilated.

9920
11:39:40,960 --> 11:39:42,960
You poor thing, you.

9921
11:39:42,960 --> 11:39:44,960
Yeah?

9922
11:39:45,960 --> 11:39:47,960
Ah.

9923
11:39:47,960 --> 11:39:50,960
Okay, up in the air is fine, better than, I know.

9924
11:39:52,960 --> 11:39:53,960
I know a lot.

9925
11:39:53,960 --> 11:39:54,960
Oh, right, no.

9926
11:39:54,960 --> 11:39:55,960
Nah, I'm still playing.

9927
11:39:55,960 --> 11:39:56,960
I doubt we're gonna...

9928
11:39:56,960 --> 11:39:59,960
I don't know if we're finishing it in 12 hours, though.

9929
11:40:02,960 --> 11:40:04,960
Um, if we don't finish it,

9930
11:40:04,960 --> 11:40:06,960
but you guys tell me I'm close,

9931
11:40:06,960 --> 11:40:08,960
we'll do about, eh, we'll...

9932
11:40:08,960 --> 11:40:10,960
we'll delete.

9933
11:40:10,960 --> 11:40:12,960
Can we not go through?

9934
11:40:14,960 --> 11:40:16,960
Oh, is that a fake down?

9935
11:40:16,960 --> 11:40:18,960
Oh, it is a fake down.

9936
11:40:18,960 --> 11:40:19,960
Oh.

9937
11:40:19,960 --> 11:40:20,960
Um...

9938
11:40:20,960 --> 11:40:23,960
The Baltral stream was kind of a question mark.

9939
11:40:23,960 --> 11:40:25,960
Is this actually happening or not?

9940
11:40:25,960 --> 11:40:27,960
Cause I don't know...

9941
11:40:27,960 --> 11:40:29,960
How can you guys so...

9942
11:40:29,960 --> 11:40:30,960
How can you jump so tall?

9943
11:40:30,960 --> 11:40:32,960
Can't even get up.

9944
11:40:32,960 --> 11:40:33,960
Breath.

9945
11:40:33,960 --> 11:40:34,960
Oh.

9946
11:40:34,960 --> 11:40:36,960
Get down here.

9947
11:40:40,960 --> 11:40:42,960
Man, I love pretty...

9948
11:40:42,960 --> 11:40:43,960
Pretty...

9949
11:40:43,960 --> 11:40:45,960
They should honestly do pretty areas,

9950
11:40:45,960 --> 11:40:47,960
and I know soul games are supposed to be like,

9951
11:40:47,960 --> 11:40:50,960
depressing, like, world ending type stuff,

9952
11:40:50,960 --> 11:40:52,960
but I mean, like, come on,

9953
11:40:52,960 --> 11:40:54,960
if you're gonna put flowers and deer in the game,

9954
11:40:54,960 --> 11:40:56,960
like, you know.

9955
11:40:56,960 --> 11:40:59,960
Well, who was the last boss you fought?

9956
11:40:59,960 --> 11:41:03,960
Eh, unsuccessfully, the snake guy is the best I've got

9957
11:41:03,960 --> 11:41:05,960
for his description.

9958
11:41:05,960 --> 11:41:07,960
Eh, we defeated a sunflower,

9959
11:41:07,960 --> 11:41:09,960
and...

9960
11:41:09,960 --> 11:41:13,960
We, like, boxed the crap out of a sunflower,

9961
11:41:13,960 --> 11:41:16,960
which I actually kind of enjoyed its mechanics.

9962
11:41:16,960 --> 11:41:19,960
Whoa, sorry, did I just jump into you?

9963
11:41:21,960 --> 11:41:23,960
Wait, what?

9964
11:41:26,960 --> 11:41:28,960
Is this granny a weepling boss?

9965
11:41:29,960 --> 11:41:31,960
No?

9966
11:41:31,960 --> 11:41:33,960
Weeplings?

9967
11:41:34,960 --> 11:41:36,960
Huh?

9968
11:41:40,960 --> 11:41:43,960
Is everyone just DC, or am I really dumb,

9969
11:41:43,960 --> 11:41:45,960
and I can't follow?

9970
11:41:47,960 --> 11:41:48,960
They're done?

9971
11:41:48,960 --> 11:41:50,960
Are we not going this way?

9972
11:41:51,960 --> 11:41:52,960
There were never any weeplings.

9973
11:41:52,960 --> 11:41:54,960
Wait, did they jump down?

9974
11:41:54,960 --> 11:41:55,960
No, they couldn't.

9975
11:41:55,960 --> 11:41:57,960
Wait, they just...

9976
11:41:58,960 --> 11:42:01,960
Someone do the hey-a-mo, where are you?

9977
11:42:03,960 --> 11:42:04,960
Oh.

9978
11:42:04,960 --> 11:42:06,960
Okay, sorry, I'm here.

9979
11:42:09,960 --> 11:42:11,960
There's a hand in there.

9980
11:42:11,960 --> 11:42:13,960
Oh, we are to go down, okay.

9981
11:42:15,960 --> 11:42:17,960
Okay, sorry, sorry.

9982
11:42:20,960 --> 11:42:22,960
Don't stream and drive at the same time.

9983
11:42:22,960 --> 11:42:24,960
And by stream and drive, I mean,

9984
11:42:24,960 --> 11:42:26,960
Clay, Elden, Ring, and Co.

9985
11:42:32,960 --> 11:42:33,960
What?

9986
11:42:33,960 --> 11:42:35,960
You're halfway done, then.

9987
11:42:35,960 --> 11:42:37,960
Oh, maybe we can't finish it tomorrow.

9988
11:42:44,960 --> 11:42:46,960
Miss Mer is a halfway point.

9989
11:42:46,960 --> 11:42:48,960
Is that the guy I can't kill?

9990
11:42:48,960 --> 11:42:50,960
The one that pulls out his wee eyeball?

9991
11:42:50,960 --> 11:42:52,960
The one that pulls out his wee eyeball?

9992
11:42:54,960 --> 11:42:56,960
He's a wee rude one, if that's him.

9993
11:42:59,960 --> 11:43:02,960
I'm gonna elabel up my sword and get huge for it.

9994
11:43:07,960 --> 11:43:09,960
Come on.

9995
11:43:11,960 --> 11:43:13,960
Do we make an error? All the refills here?

9996
11:43:17,960 --> 11:43:18,960
Oh, no, one fell down.

9997
11:43:18,960 --> 11:43:20,960
That's what's wrong, one fell down.

9998
11:43:20,960 --> 11:43:22,960
One fell off and bumped his head.

9999
11:43:24,960 --> 11:43:26,960
But that's okay, we're gonna get him back.

10000
11:43:26,960 --> 11:43:28,960
Okay, we got another thing in my bowl.

10001
11:43:30,960 --> 11:43:32,960
Thank you, Mr. Boo.

10002
11:43:32,960 --> 11:43:33,960
Oh.

10003
11:43:33,960 --> 11:43:35,960
That wasn't a good thing.

10004
11:43:35,960 --> 11:43:36,960
Well.

10005
11:43:36,960 --> 11:43:38,960
Good is objective.

10006
11:43:38,960 --> 11:43:40,960
Oh, it wasn't what I thought it was.

10007
11:43:40,960 --> 11:43:42,960
I thought it was one of them figure things.

10008
11:43:42,960 --> 11:43:44,960
Oh, we did it!

10009
11:43:44,960 --> 11:43:46,960
Okay, we're in another finger's room.

10010
11:43:49,960 --> 11:43:52,960
Is there a leafling here at this grace site?

10011
11:43:53,960 --> 11:43:57,960
Oh, I can't look, check the map to tell you what grace site is.

10012
11:43:57,960 --> 11:44:00,960
Have a good night, I'm gonna wake up and listen for it.

10013
11:44:00,960 --> 11:44:02,960
Oh, you should definitely get some sleep.

10014
11:44:03,960 --> 11:44:04,960
Alright, here's the last.

10015
11:44:04,960 --> 11:44:06,960
Gav, I think I...

10016
11:44:08,960 --> 11:44:10,960
I think Gav is next.

10017
11:44:10,960 --> 11:44:12,960
And then it's gone.

10018
11:44:14,960 --> 11:44:17,960
The helmet you're wearing reduces your healing ability.

10019
11:44:17,960 --> 11:44:19,960
Why would that even be a thing?

10020
11:44:23,960 --> 11:44:25,960
Let's put this on again.

10021
11:44:26,960 --> 11:44:28,960
Oh, wait, that's the matching helmet.

10022
11:44:34,960 --> 11:44:35,960
15 minutes, no?

10023
11:44:35,960 --> 11:44:38,960
If you have 15 minutes for me to blow this horn.

10024
11:44:39,960 --> 11:44:41,960
Where is it?

10025
11:44:43,960 --> 11:44:45,960
Okay, let's try it, let's try it.

10026
11:44:45,960 --> 11:44:47,960
We're on the clock.

10027
11:44:47,960 --> 11:44:49,960
We need to perfect this.

10028
11:44:51,960 --> 11:44:53,960
Surely we can perfect this.

10029
11:44:56,960 --> 11:44:58,960
Fuck that, keep running, keep running!

10030
11:44:59,960 --> 11:45:02,960
Keep running, you're gonna get absolutely rolled.

10031
11:45:03,960 --> 11:45:05,960
If I'm in, they're spawning in.

10032
11:45:08,960 --> 11:45:10,960
Oh my god, there's more of those worm bastards.

10033
11:45:10,960 --> 11:45:13,960
We need to stick together for the worm.

10034
11:45:14,960 --> 11:45:16,960
Just in case one of us gets in trouble.

10035
11:45:17,960 --> 11:45:19,960
Is the other refling coming?

10036
11:45:20,960 --> 11:45:22,960
Just be careful.

10037
11:45:25,960 --> 11:45:28,960
Yeah, be careful, the worms are merciless.

10038
11:45:29,960 --> 11:45:31,960
Those wiggly worms, they're terrible.

10039
11:45:32,960 --> 11:45:36,960
We said this like six hours ago, but I guess you are too trashy, Gav.

10040
11:45:38,960 --> 11:45:39,960
I didn't realize I had the help.

10041
11:45:39,960 --> 11:45:42,960
I know, someone said like it had something wrong with it.

10042
11:45:42,960 --> 11:45:47,960
And I think I asked like what it was, and then of course I never read it, but like read every other message.

10043
11:45:47,960 --> 11:45:56,960
Okay, we're against the worms again, but we can charge, destroy the worms, teach them a lesson, make them regret being born.

10044
11:45:57,960 --> 11:45:59,960
What are worms?

10045
11:46:00,960 --> 11:46:02,960
What's their category?

10046
11:46:02,960 --> 11:46:14,960
Call me Ashley, because I'm Colfin of Andy and Lily.

10047
11:46:16,960 --> 11:46:17,960
Thank you, thank you.

10048
11:46:18,960 --> 11:46:20,960
I didn't have time to hit a button.

10049
11:46:26,960 --> 11:46:28,960
That's where you take it, you take it like a good worm.

10050
11:46:28,960 --> 11:46:32,960
Oh God, oh God, I'm getting jumped, they're jumping me, they're jumping me.

10051
11:46:36,960 --> 11:46:39,960
Okay, they didn't quite jump me, but whatever.

10052
11:46:41,960 --> 11:46:42,960
Okay, we did it, we did it.

10053
11:46:42,960 --> 11:46:44,960
I got saved from being jumped.

10054
11:46:46,960 --> 11:46:48,960
Worms and floods are not insects.

10055
11:46:49,960 --> 11:46:50,960
What are worms?

10056
11:46:53,960 --> 11:46:55,960
Okay, that one was alright, thank you, thank you.

10057
11:46:56,960 --> 11:46:57,960
Moment.

10058
11:47:04,960 --> 11:47:05,960
Okay, we did it.

10059
11:47:06,960 --> 11:47:11,960
We did it, we're gonna blow it, we're gonna go to the church, and then we're gonna redirect successfully because there's blood blowing up.

10060
11:47:12,960 --> 11:47:15,960
Okay, Reeflings, thank you so much, please leave, please leave, thank you.

10061
11:47:15,960 --> 11:47:16,960
Why are you naked?

10062
11:47:16,960 --> 11:47:17,960
Why are you naked?

10063
11:47:19,960 --> 11:47:20,960
What the heck?

10064
11:47:21,960 --> 11:47:22,960
Are you transforming?

10065
11:47:25,960 --> 11:47:27,960
You can become a dragon?

10066
11:47:30,960 --> 11:47:32,960
You're like half-dragon then.

10067
11:47:33,960 --> 11:47:36,960
Okay, I'll very quickly go to the church and talk to this man.

10068
11:47:37,960 --> 11:47:38,960
Wow.

10069
11:47:45,960 --> 11:47:48,960
Okay, talk to the man in the church and then I'm done.

10070
11:47:48,960 --> 11:47:50,960
Is anyone on you need me to flip on?

10071
11:47:51,960 --> 11:47:53,960
If not, be in you, you're next.

10072
11:47:53,960 --> 11:47:57,960
Unfortunately, my thoughts don't actually stream on.

10073
11:48:00,960 --> 11:48:02,960
Hello, I did what you asked for.

10074
11:48:02,960 --> 11:48:05,960
I'm not really sure what it was, but I did it anyway.

10075
11:48:05,960 --> 11:48:06,960
Hello.

10076
11:48:08,960 --> 11:48:09,960
Hi.

10077
11:48:16,960 --> 11:48:18,960
Thanks for the stream, you're more than welcome.

10078
11:48:18,960 --> 11:48:21,960
See you tomorrow, same time, same endurance.

10079
11:48:22,960 --> 11:48:23,960
Is the door still up?

10080
11:48:24,960 --> 11:48:26,960
Oh, I assume she's all flamed by now.

10081
11:48:40,960 --> 11:48:42,960
Ruins map, interesting.

10082
11:48:43,960 --> 11:48:47,960
Yeah, I don't know who's beaten up stuff in here, but it's not me.

10083
11:48:47,960 --> 11:48:48,960
Okay, we did it.

10084
11:48:48,960 --> 11:48:50,960
We did a heck of a lot of questions.

10085
11:48:50,960 --> 11:48:52,960
I hope you guys remember my progress.

10086
11:48:52,960 --> 11:48:54,960
I have no idea what I've done, what I haven't achieved, what I haven't achieved.

10087
11:48:54,960 --> 11:48:56,960
Oh, is there still up? Hold on.

10088
11:48:56,960 --> 11:48:59,960
Let me just message her real quickly.

10089
11:48:59,960 --> 11:49:03,960
And by message her, go into her live stream and ask if she's still on me.

10090
11:49:04,960 --> 11:49:07,960
But is there a stream for her?

10091
11:49:07,960 --> 11:49:10,960
Oh god, she's playing League, no wonder she's a fucking streamer.

10092
11:49:10,960 --> 11:49:11,960
Dragon?

10093
11:49:12,960 --> 11:49:13,960
Anyone?

10094
11:49:13,960 --> 11:49:17,960
Are you streaming streaming for longer?

10095
11:49:17,960 --> 11:49:21,960
This game is not fucking horrible. This game is weird.

10096
11:49:21,960 --> 11:49:22,960
Are you left?

10097
11:49:22,960 --> 11:49:24,960
Oh my god, there's almost 5k.

10098
11:49:24,960 --> 11:49:26,960
Anybody want to help me?

10099
11:49:26,960 --> 11:49:28,960
Anybody want to help me get dragon?

10100
11:49:30,960 --> 11:49:31,960
Anyone?

10101
11:49:35,960 --> 11:49:38,960
This game is not fucking horrible. This game is weird.

10102
11:49:39,960 --> 11:49:40,960
Are you left?

10103
11:49:40,960 --> 11:49:42,960
Oh, coward.

10104
11:49:43,960 --> 11:49:46,960
Coward, are you streaming for longer? Yes.

10105
11:49:46,960 --> 11:49:47,960
Okay.

10106
11:49:47,960 --> 11:49:48,960
I am.

10107
11:49:48,960 --> 11:49:49,960
You're getting a cheeky wish.

10108
11:49:49,960 --> 11:49:50,960
I am.

10109
11:49:50,960 --> 11:49:51,960
You are.

10110
11:49:52,960 --> 11:49:55,960
I am. You're sending them in here to be tortured?

10111
11:49:55,960 --> 11:49:56,960
Yeah, exactly.

10112
11:49:58,960 --> 11:50:00,960
I welcome them with open arms.

10113
11:50:00,960 --> 11:50:02,960
Are you squidding here, though?

10114
11:50:03,960 --> 11:50:07,960
Stronny, I love you and I wish I could have stayed the whole stream,

10115
11:50:07,960 --> 11:50:09,960
but my brain isn't wired to do so.

10116
11:50:09,960 --> 11:50:10,960
Oh man.

10117
11:50:10,960 --> 11:50:12,960
Keep up the grind, crazy lady.

10118
11:50:12,960 --> 11:50:14,960
Oh, I love you too, little reaper.

10119
11:50:14,960 --> 11:50:15,960
Thank you for the tip.

10120
11:50:15,960 --> 11:50:16,960
That was very kind of you to say, boy.

10121
11:50:16,960 --> 11:50:17,960
You heard it.

10122
11:50:17,960 --> 11:50:19,960
As there is a welcoming...

10123
11:50:19,960 --> 11:50:21,960
She wants to torture you, but in a nice way.

10124
11:50:21,960 --> 11:50:22,960
With League of Legends.

10125
11:50:22,960 --> 11:50:24,960
I have no idea what the game is about.

10126
11:50:24,960 --> 11:50:26,960
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.

10127
11:50:26,960 --> 11:50:28,960
She's doing fantastic.

10128
11:50:28,960 --> 11:50:30,960
I think all the girls are about to hit 5k.

10129
11:50:30,960 --> 11:50:31,960
You know that.

10130
11:50:31,960 --> 11:50:32,960
Hold on.

10131
11:50:32,960 --> 11:50:33,960
Let me check.

10132
11:50:33,960 --> 11:50:34,960
Hold on to me.

10133
11:50:34,960 --> 11:50:35,960
Check, ladies and gentlemen.

10134
11:50:35,960 --> 11:50:36,960
Are you okay?

10135
11:50:36,960 --> 11:50:37,960
Are you happy?

10136
11:50:37,960 --> 11:50:38,960
Hold on, let me...

10137
11:50:39,960 --> 11:50:40,960
Let me see.

10138
11:50:41,960 --> 11:50:44,960
Most of the ICN is 0 and 4.9k.

10139
11:50:44,960 --> 11:50:45,960
They're fantastic.

10140
11:50:45,960 --> 11:50:47,960
They're about to both hit 5k.

10141
11:50:47,960 --> 11:50:50,960
And then everyone will hit 5k in less than a freaking month.

10142
11:50:50,960 --> 11:50:52,960
The month isn't even over.

10143
11:50:53,960 --> 11:50:54,960
Oh my God.

10144
11:50:54,960 --> 11:50:56,960
Thank you so, so much, little refunds.

10145
11:50:56,960 --> 11:50:59,960
It has been an absolute pleasure to do it yet again.

10146
11:50:59,960 --> 11:51:00,960
Another endurance stream.

10147
11:51:00,960 --> 11:51:02,960
Thank you so much for carrying me.

10148
11:51:02,960 --> 11:51:05,960
Your advice, your patience through the highs and lows

10149
11:51:05,960 --> 11:51:09,960
of my energy levels going skyrocket into being quiet

10150
11:51:09,960 --> 11:51:12,960
to just going nuts and starting to sing so hard.

10151
11:51:12,960 --> 11:51:14,960
I don't know what I was doing, honestly.

10152
11:51:15,960 --> 11:51:18,960
Thank you all so much.

10153
11:51:18,960 --> 11:51:22,960
I will see you tomorrow at the same time.

10154
11:51:22,960 --> 11:51:24,960
And for more endurance,

10155
11:51:24,960 --> 11:51:27,960
we may or may not actually finish the DLC.

10156
11:51:27,960 --> 11:51:31,960
If we do, then the schedule is still confirmed

10157
11:51:31,960 --> 11:51:34,960
if I have the image of the schedule.

10158
11:51:36,960 --> 11:51:40,960
Which I will re-show you a question mark, maybe?

10159
11:51:43,960 --> 11:51:44,960
Is it successful?

10160
11:51:44,960 --> 11:51:45,960
That would be successful.

10161
11:51:45,960 --> 11:51:46,960
There we go.

10162
11:51:47,960 --> 11:51:49,960
So tomorrow is Elden Ring.

10163
11:51:49,960 --> 11:51:51,960
That counts as the Monday stream.

10164
11:51:52,960 --> 11:51:55,960
And then at 2pm, no, sorry.

10165
11:51:55,960 --> 11:51:58,960
It's not adjusted to my time zone.

10166
11:51:58,960 --> 11:52:00,960
At the normal time,

10167
11:52:00,960 --> 11:52:01,960
I stream.

10168
11:52:02,960 --> 11:52:04,960
At the normal time, I stream.

10169
11:52:04,960 --> 11:52:05,960
It's ASMR.

10170
11:52:05,960 --> 11:52:07,960
And then 2 hours of ASMR, public.

10171
11:52:07,960 --> 11:52:11,960
And then a private membership-only script write-in

10172
11:52:11,960 --> 11:52:12,960
where we do stuff.

10173
11:52:12,960 --> 11:52:14,960
And if it gets good reception,

10174
11:52:14,960 --> 11:52:15,960
I'm happy to do more.

10175
11:52:15,960 --> 11:52:17,960
If it's not really what people are looking for,

10176
11:52:17,960 --> 11:52:19,960
we'll kind of maybe just do it

10177
11:52:19,960 --> 11:52:22,960
like in an odd every one, every three weeks or something.

10178
11:52:22,960 --> 11:52:25,960
And then I have an Among Us collab with Yumi Plus,

10179
11:52:25,960 --> 11:52:26,960
Veealer versus Yumi Plus.

10180
11:52:26,960 --> 11:52:28,960
Please don't think we're actually versing each other

10181
11:52:28,960 --> 11:52:31,960
because it's not possible, because the game is randomized.

10182
11:52:33,960 --> 11:52:35,960
But if you ever wanted to hear me get angry,

10183
11:52:35,960 --> 11:52:38,960
because nothing makes me more enraged

10184
11:52:38,960 --> 11:52:39,960
when I'm telling the truth

10185
11:52:39,960 --> 11:52:42,960
and someone's like trying to pin something on me,

10186
11:52:42,960 --> 11:52:44,960
I never get so loud in my life.

10187
11:52:44,960 --> 11:52:45,960
So look out for that.

10188
11:52:45,960 --> 11:52:50,960
We are playing Mech Assault, the Xbox original game,

10189
11:52:50,960 --> 11:52:53,960
which is going to be scaled up beautifully.

10190
11:52:53,960 --> 11:52:57,960
And then there's going to be a membership ASMR stream as well.

10191
11:52:57,960 --> 11:53:03,960
Roughly eight hours later, because the estimation,

10192
11:53:03,960 --> 11:53:08,960
estimation is, is what?

10193
11:53:08,960 --> 11:53:11,960
Eight hour gameplay time.

10194
11:53:11,960 --> 11:53:13,960
A very old game.

10195
11:53:13,960 --> 11:53:15,960
Played it, I say played it.

10196
11:53:15,960 --> 11:53:16,960
I watched my dad play it.

10197
11:53:16,960 --> 11:53:19,960
I was probably too young to even fucking hold the controller

10198
11:53:19,960 --> 11:53:20,960
to be honest.

10199
11:53:20,960 --> 11:53:23,960
Boutro is a go.

10200
11:53:23,960 --> 11:53:24,960
And then RuneScape part four,

10201
11:53:24,960 --> 11:53:26,960
I'm going to release all the thumbnails,

10202
11:53:26,960 --> 11:53:28,960
which tells you what movies we're watching.

10203
11:53:28,960 --> 11:53:31,960
But RuneScape part four, we're doing a movie marathon

10204
11:53:31,960 --> 11:53:32,960
alongside it.

10205
11:53:32,960 --> 11:53:34,960
And then RuneScape part five,

10206
11:53:34,960 --> 11:53:36,960
we're doing a Veil or Marathon,

10207
11:53:36,960 --> 11:53:39,960
because there's so many streams from the girls I want to watch.

10208
11:53:39,960 --> 11:53:42,960
And what better excuse to shove them in the corner

10209
11:53:42,960 --> 11:53:47,960
whilst I make wines than doing that.

10210
11:53:47,960 --> 11:53:52,960
And then to have a wee bit of a shorter ending of the week.

10211
11:53:52,960 --> 11:53:56,960
We had two hour binding of Isaac Run.

10212
11:53:56,960 --> 11:54:03,960
And then it's normally one hour per successful run.

10213
11:54:03,960 --> 11:54:04,960
We're going to do Eden.

10214
11:54:04,960 --> 11:54:06,960
I don't know if we're going to win or not.

10215
11:54:06,960 --> 11:54:09,960
And then I actually wanted to watch the original Iron Man.

10216
11:54:09,960 --> 11:54:15,960
I've not seen it in many a year.

10217
11:54:15,960 --> 11:54:19,960
And I wanted to see if I sort of remember it being like this.

10218
11:54:19,960 --> 11:54:21,960
So we're going to watch Iron Man.

10219
11:54:21,960 --> 11:54:24,960
I don't know if it's a bad taste, but I wanted to try it out.

10220
11:54:24,960 --> 11:54:25,960
Did you figure out the movies?

10221
11:54:25,960 --> 11:54:29,960
We're going to do John Wick for the movies.

10222
11:54:29,960 --> 11:54:36,960
I couldn't find anything else that I was interested in

10223
11:54:36,960 --> 11:54:37,960
or was in the mood in.

10224
11:54:37,960 --> 11:54:40,960
I want to watch something that's pretty cool, high action.

10225
11:54:40,960 --> 11:54:46,960
I'm not really wanting to watch anything that's not really for the masses.

10226
11:54:46,960 --> 11:54:47,960
So I picked John Wick.

10227
11:54:47,960 --> 11:54:50,960
I think John Wick is the good balance of everything that I want.

10228
11:54:50,960 --> 11:54:53,960
Because at one point I was like fast and furious.

10229
11:54:53,960 --> 11:54:56,960
I'm like they're fast and furious to the moon.

10230
11:54:56,960 --> 11:54:59,960
Oh no, we're past the 11.55.
