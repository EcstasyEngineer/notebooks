0	2000	I'm gonna cry in my ankle.
3000	4000	Wah!
4000	5000	Wah!
5000	6000	It's up.
7000	8000	It's up.
8000	10000	I think it's up.
11000	13000	I've just booted this freaking game
13000	15000	and the music!
15000	17000	Oh my gosh!
23000	24000	Are you there?
24000	26000	Hopefully I'm live.
26000	29000	I know I've started like nine minutes early
29000	31000	but I'm just sitting here
31000	32000	and I'm like,
32000	34000	I don't want to wait the nine minutes
34000	37000	for when I'm supposed to start my stream time.
37000	39000	I just want to start now.
39000	41000	So I'm starting now.
41000	44000	I just need to make sure I can see I'm live
44000	46000	and then I can close my stream.
46000	48000	Okay, yeah, it says I'm live.
48000	50000	I'm so sorry I've been boozled.
50000	52000	Yes, I put in the wrong date.
52000	54000	I put in the wrong hour.
55000	57000	Shocking behavior.
57000	59000	Um...
59000	61000	I have
61000	64000	the most kind of like
64000	67000	saddest start to a stream so far.
68000	70000	Um, I got on Marshmallow
70000	72000	but sadly due to text
72000	76000	I cannot see what the tone is behind
76000	79000	and I've read that Marshmallow
79000	82000	is like a veiled threat or something
82000	84000	but I just want to say
84000	87000	to the person who sent me a cat picture link
87000	90000	like an actual picture of a cat
90000	93000	um, I don't know how to break this to you.
93000	96000	I got my payloads in March
96000	98000	after a very rough time
98000	101000	where I realized that life was too short.
101000	103000	I've not owned a pet.
103000	105000	Okay, since then
105000	108000	and my payloads came into my life in March
108000	110000	so please, like,
110000	113000	I don't know if it was like a weird threat thing going on
113000	115000	and I know for literally everyone else
115000	117000	this makes no sense
117000	120000	but I can't read tone in a text
120000	122000	and it looked like a weird veiled threat
122000	124000	and I just like
124000	127000	I got my payloads in March
127000	130000	and yeah
130000	132000	I don't know what to tell you
132000	134000	like I've visited America as a child
134000	136000	at nine years old
136000	138000	I don't live in America
138000	140000	I don't know what's going on
140000	143000	so you identified yourself as not a refling
143000	145000	so if it's all good
145000	147000	I'm just gonna, you know, stream here
147000	150000	with my reflins and we're gonna do our thing
150000	153000	um, hopefully it wasn't actually a threat
153000	155000	but if it was
155000	158000	then hey ho, I've addressed it
158000	160000	and I've negated what your
160000	162000	evidence was
162000	165000	purely on the basis that I got
165000	167000	Gimli and Vigo in March
167000	170000	and that's when I got my payloads
170000	172000	so yeah, I apologise for that
172000	174000	making absolutely no sense
174000	175000	to literally everyone else
175000	177000	but good morning, good evening
177000	178000	and good afternoon
178000	180000	it is a wild ride
180000	182000	you play two games of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
182000	186000	I'm literally not even on my third game stream
186000	188000	I've never done a second game stream variation
188000	190000	and it's like oh
190000	192000	I don't think it's a threat
192000	194000	but at the same time my brain's telling me it's a veiled threat
194000	196000	so I'm just gonna address it that way
196000	198000	if you didn't mean it, sure
198000	200000	but as I said
200000	202000	I don't live in America
202000	204000	I have two cats
204000	206000	that I got in March
206000	208000	they were adopted and
208000	211000	yeah, I don't know what else to tell you bro
211000	214000	I'd just appreciate if you left me alone
214000	216000	and I'll just
216000	218000	be having fun with my reflins
218000	219000	so thanks
219000	221000	don't do that again
222000	223000	um
223000	225000	yes, anyway
225000	227000	now that we've got that part over
227000	228000	Jesus
228000	230000	a little bit of a restless sleep
230000	232000	may or may not have had diarrhea
232000	234000	because I can't tell context
234000	235000	however
235000	237000	we're gonna be playing
237000	239000	a game
239000	242000	called Needy Streamer
242000	243000	Overload
243000	245000	I just opened it up
245000	248000	and it gave me a kind of Windows XP thing
248000	250000	Windows Vista was like
250000	252000	before me I'm like
252000	253000	99% sure
253000	255000	wait, Windows Vista
257000	259000	I don't think I even had
259000	261000	wait, when?
261000	263000	wait, this is Windows Vista
263000	265000	no, I think Windows Vista
265000	266000	when
266000	267000	released it
270000	271000	oh
271000	273000	would my dad have had that on the console?
273000	274000	well
274000	275000	let's give it a
275000	277000	Windows Vista
277000	279000	or Windows 98
279000	281000	I don't know what version of Windows, okay
283000	285000	so we're gonna have a shot at this game
285000	287000	I don't know what to expect
287000	289000	now a few reflings told me yesterday
289000	291000	that for a factoid
291000	293000	this game apparently has over
293000	295000	500 different endings
295000	297000	or I made that number up because someone said
297000	299000	the game had a ton of endings
299000	302000	now this is gonna be a shorter stream today
302000	305000	but the good news with it being a shorter stream
305000	307000	is I
307000	309000	might be able to release
309000	311000	my first ASMR
311000	313000	1k thank you audio
313000	314000	today
314000	315000	but I need to go edit it
315000	317000	but it's gonna be fun and it's clean
317000	319000	it's clean ASMR
319000	321000	it's literally me just rambling
321000	323000	and tapping away on stuff
323000	325000	and all that kind of thing
325000	326000	so it's cute
326000	328000	just a short 9 hour stream today
328000	330000	I'm sure you can strap in the lads and lasses
330000	332000	then you worry
332000	334000	only 7 hours, yeah
335000	339000	I was actually thinking Skyrim
339000	342000	I've put down Skyrim as 212 back to back
343000	346000	I don't know
346000	348000	if I should purposely wake up
348000	350000	right before stream for the Skyrim
350000	352000	and then make a second room
352000	354000	and then we'll do like 12 hours
354000	357000	and then in the second room another 4 hours
357000	359000	and then I think the following day
359000	361000	that 12 hour stream I can complete
361000	363000	the full achievements
363000	366000	I'm not 100% sure
366000	368000	I do have a honey tea with me though
368000	370000	so hopefully you have some water
370000	372000	some snackies
372000	374000	and all that jazz
374000	376000	but yes, next week
376000	379000	our endurance stream is going to be
383000	384000	Skyrim
384000	387000	and we're also doing an endurance runescape
387000	388000	old school runescape
388000	390000	I will tell you what world to be in
390000	393000	I am going to start on a fresh account
393000	395000	I am going to buy premium endurance
395000	398000	but we'll get to that when we get to that
398000	400000	you know what I mean
401000	402000	so let's stream into it
402000	404000	yeah, I'm a bit fatined
404000	405000	for streaming
405000	407000	really enjoy it
407000	408000	like some people
408000	410000	due to their circumstances
410000	412000	they can't stream every day
412000	414000	they find it a bit harder
414000	415000	and mentally it takes its toll
415000	416000	me?
416000	417000	um
417000	418000	like
418000	420000	I'm about to try out this crazy game
420000	421000	for the first time
421000	423000	I don't know much about it
423000	425000	apparently you can do implied
425000	426000	scenes in it
426000	428000	so I'm like
428000	430000	here we go
430000	432000	so I'm interested
433000	435000	I don't know if it should just get straight into it
435000	436000	you guys can hear it
436000	438000	it's not too loud
438000	440000	I was worried about the music being too loud
440000	442000	I can almost turn it off on my end
442000	443000	but yeah
443000	445000	yeah some streamers like
445000	446000	just do it circumstances
446000	448000	but I just seem to have the perfect mesh
448000	450000	of like missing brain cells here
450000	452000	a bit of a smooth brain here
452000	454000	a bit more of a complex surface area
454000	455000	of the section of my brain
455000	456000	music's actually a bit quiet
456000	457000	right okay
457000	459000	it's just loud in my headset
459000	460000	okay
460000	462000	I've turned off a bit
462000	464000	I'm a wee bit close to my mic
464000	465000	but
465000	466000	right
466000	468000	oh it's got a little love heart
468000	469000	see that
469000	471000	so Mersey was theorised
471000	473000	that her heart
473000	475000	right this is what I theorised when Mersey thingied
475000	477000	Mersey's pupils
477000	479000	are normal
479000	480000	before
480000	481000	her first
481000	483000	experience as a yandere occurred
483000	484000	and then
484000	486000	her pupils broke
486000	488000	and she can no longer love appropriately
488000	490000	like the concept doesn't exist for her
490000	492000	if you look back in
492000	493000	Amy's lore video
493000	494000	you'll notice she
494000	495000	her pupils are normal
495000	497000	until she picks up that book
498000	499000	hey little small details
499000	501000	obviously my pupils have always been
501000	503000	the little cuddle fishes
504000	505000	she's broken
506000	507000	I started to realise
507000	508000	that if someone has a feature
508000	509000	within their entire brain
509000	510000	it's just soup
510000	511000	honestly
511000	512000	I would happily join
512000	513000	the
513000	515000	the study data group thing
515000	516000	you can hook me up
516000	517000	because I can prove that
517000	519000	I'm pretty dumb
519000	520000	like yeah
522000	523000	I didn't think to pay attention
523000	524000	no there's like
524000	525000	little small details
525000	527000	like in everyone's lore like
527000	528000	you know
528000	529000	Aisy
529000	530000	has
530000	532000	scars from the polar bear
532000	534000	that she destroyed
534000	535000	and then she raised
535000	536000	feral
536000	537000	and like
537000	538000	kind of like
538000	539000	all kind of plays back into it
539000	540000	like
540000	541000	for Aisy's
541000	542000	audio work
542000	543000	she's actually
543000	545000	babe this is going to sound
545000	546000	terrible
546000	547000	I'm so sorry
547000	549000	this is going to sound terrible
549000	550000	in
550000	551000	my
551000	552000	experience
552000	555000	if there is ever an audio produced
555000	556000	where you
556000	557000	listener
557000	559000	may or may not be taking
559000	561000	have been
561000	562000	taken
562000	563000	by
563000	564000	banpage of
564000	565000	by
565000	567000	the female performer
567000	570000	it always goes down really well
570000	572000	and I consented Aisy
572000	574000	with the idea that she doesn't
574000	575000	know what
575000	576000	bincent is
576000	577000	she doesn't know what
577000	578000	bincent is
578000	580000	she just jumps on you basically
580000	582000	no prior warning
582000	584000	because she was raised feral
584000	585000	so it's not a thing like
585000	586000	if you're a bear
586000	588000	you grab what you want instantly
588000	589000	you want to eat
589000	590000	okay let's go down to the river
590000	591000	you want to claim this tree
591000	593000	heck yeah let's claim this tree
593000	594000	so yeah
594000	595000	and
595000	597000	I kind of made her like that
597000	599000	I've not made her do anything like that
599000	600000	but
600000	602000	it's just kind of like a small detail
602000	603000	because everyone's like
603000	605000	oh this brat needs correction
605000	607000	or like oji-san you can't keep up
607000	609000	and it's kind of
609000	611000	interesting to see that dynamic form
611000	613000	because the dynamic in my head was like
613000	616000	she completely has you wrapped around her
616000	618000	claw
618000	619000	type thing
619000	621000	and she does what she wants to do
621000	623000	which is so terrible
625000	627000	but look this is a fun thing about
627000	629000	like going from concept
629000	631000	to actually what's happening now like
631000	633000	as I said girls I've full control
634000	636000	type thing going on
637000	640000	my update for YouTube monetization
640000	642000	my statistics have updated
642000	644000	and we've been told
644000	646000	like I can see on my YouTube
646000	648000	that I've met the watch hour
648000	650000	when I go to apply for monetization
650000	652000	it says I've only got 88 hours watch time
652000	654000	and I'm like
654000	656000	right it's been four days
656000	658000	I would like to apply for it now
658000	660000	like I have no idea why it's taking so long
660000	662000	to update it's crazy
662000	664000	crazy
664000	666000	I'm going to take a sipping tin of my tea
666000	668000	and then we'll see what this game provides
670000	672000	yes so I am warning you
672000	674000	it is a shorter stream today
674000	676000	however I do think
676000	678000	Shibi is coming on in two hours
678000	680000	I think A.C. is having a rest day
680000	682000	Shibi
682000	684000	and me is a rest day for Azura
684000	686000	I think Azura does double back rest days
686000	688000	what kind of tea
688000	690000	it's always the same tea
690000	692000	it's a British
692000	694000	like I think it's called black tea
694000	696000	or English breakfast tea
696000	698000	either variation with honey
700000	702000	but once having a tough time sleeping
702000	704000	is a gist thing

726000	728000	like imagine listening
728000	730000	I can hear it now imagine that voice going
730000	732000	by neural ear to ear
732000	734000	and kisses
734000	736000	and I hope she hugs the mic
736000	738000	I don't tell anyone what to do
738000	740000	but if she hugs the mic
740000	742000	heartbeat Azura
742000	744000	heartbeat and kisses ASMR
744000	746000	from Azura
746000	748000	I'm already on cloud nine
748000	750000	I don't know what to tell you
750000	752000	I don't know what to tell you
752000	754000	also I may have infected
754000	756000	Azura
756000	758000	and Shibi
758000	760000	they said they might play Assassin's Creed brotherhood
760000	762000	in a later time because I've inspired them
762000	764000	and they remember playing the games
764000	766000	I'm going to be fangirling
766000	768000	so hard
768000	770000	if I get to watch them play brotherhood
770000	772000	but good morning
772000	774000	good evening
774000	776000	good afternoon or good time zone
776000	778000	like that one we fling said
778000	780000	no better feeling than chilling
780000	782000	your childhood game
782000	784000	I didn't know Azura played that game
784000	786000	because
786000	788000	she spoke a lot of watching anime
788000	790000	in her 2.0
790000	792000	so I was like okay
792000	794000	on a scale of gamer to weave
794000	796000	I'd say she was a weave type thing
796000	798000	we aren't
798000	800000	real we fling's youtube is telling on us
800000	802000	ahhh
802000	804000	evening you
804000	806000	let's spread the AC love oh yeah
806000	808000	spread my AC all over your face
808000	810000	so Johnny you maybe want to replay
810000	812000	it's so good
812000	814000	we are going to revisit in october
814000	816000	but my morning has been good
816000	818000	my pants have been chat
818000	820000	if you haven't smoked
820000	822000	aww I never got a marshmallow
822000	824000	from a fart
824000	826000	from the toilet
826000	828000	I don't think he is here anymore
828000	830000	I think he is in the national cryo chamber
830000	832000	unfortunately
832000	833600	but like
834000	836000	but iknie started her stream yesterday
836000	838000	and she was like
838000	840000	Oh and I did it this morning
840000	842000	it's got a really weird marshmallow
842000	843840	and I'm like
843840	849280	can upset or offend anyone or anything like that. I'm like I can't read context so my
849280	854560	brain's like is someone threatening me? I don't know. But yeah, bizarre. Bizarre.
857440	861600	Ripterbiel one-pants shitted. Honestly it was fucking weekend, I'm not being funny but
862800	867680	it's absolutely, you know what, you know what, it's a British word that I don't use often at all
867680	878000	but I saw it in a tiktok recently. That's Pongen. Like P-O-N-G-E-D. Pongen. Pongen. Pongen.
878000	884560	So smells. It's such a bizarre word. I don't say that, I'm just like, that's Rican. We say Rican.
884560	892000	R-E-E-K-I-N-G. Rican. Pongen. Oh I'm sorry, that sounds Dutch. Pongendjunger.
892640	900240	Hello. Mingen. Oh yeah, Mingen. Rican. I say Rican for smell. I think Mingen's like more disgust
900240	907200	but Rican is for smell. I'm British, you've never heard that. Pongen. Like when it pongs,
907200	916240	I wonder if it's an older word. My gran. My gran, I think she said, oh that's Pongen.
916240	922480	Although she made me laugh one time. She calls farts Windy Pops and I was like,
923200	928720	and I burst out laughing. I've never heard it being referred to as Windy Pops before and I'm like,
928720	934320	I don't know, okay. That's like, it's so polite and so British. Like if we end up getting a British
934320	940560	Virgin too, I'm making her say like, ooh Windy Pops, like in our wee English accent. I'll say
940560	946800	in that we could get a Welsh or Northern Irish, Irish. But sometimes Northern Irish don't really
946800	950480	want to be referred to as British, you know. And in a way, I completely respect and understand
950480	955440	like, let's not get into it. Wait until you learn. Wait until we do the history stream
955440	964080	of why the Irish famine, potato famine wasn't actually real. Thanks to the British Empire.
965040	972000	It's ridiculous. But yes, if you didn't know a lot of Irish migrated to America,
972000	976960	a lot of Irish migrated to Scotland, to different parts, to in search of working food.
978720	984320	Which is why a lot of you are like, I'm one eighth Scottish, I'm one eighth Irish type thing.
984320	992080	Heck yeah, you are. Because that's how mass migration worked. So you know that one eighth
992080	999120	Scottish in yet? That's right. I'm in you right now. I mean, I'm in your blood supply. I'm beating
999120	1005280	around there. I'm seeking things in your body because you're like one sixteenth Scott.
1008880	1015760	As a British person, a lot of things were up for. Well England, with its sanctions on Scotland.
1016080	1026800	Please don't take strunnies in me. Oh yeah. I thought it was meant to be the other way around.
1026800	1031040	Look, it works both ways here. That's all I'm saying. Look, some people, look, some people didn't
1031040	1036560	like it. I respect that. Okay. All I'm saying is that if I had some sort of sensory organ,
1037520	1040160	it would give me more of a reason to explore even more.
1040320	1048800	One fourth Scottish, let's move actually. What percent campfire will we tolerate?
1049600	1050880	I see the most common.
1053680	1056880	I have 3% strunnie in me. There we go.
1059280	1064320	The potato famine was not fun for Ireland. Well, wait until you learn even more about the issues.
1065200	1074320	Maybe we can do an education stream about it, but I don't want it to be hate because I assure you
1074320	1080000	any English twat the day did not have any bearing on the famine.
1081040	1085920	But I don't mind doing historical education streams. The reason why Ireland kinetized them
1085920	1091840	with Scotland is because there was mass migration due to that. I don't mind a cheeky education stream
1091840	1097920	once in a while. I've actually really always enjoyed academics. Sadly, the social sides of
1097920	1104480	academics, I may have failed that part, but I've always enjoyed it. I'm actually going back to
1104480	1112560	college soon, which I'm excited to talk about. Not now though. Man's trying to run a business.
1114400	1118160	Well, I say that. I'm actually passing off it. So it's everyone else's problem, but mine.
1118480	1130480	But I am thinking of doing beauty school. But listen, hear me out, beauty school dropout.
1131440	1138160	That's a grease thing. The reason why I'm doing beauty school is because I want to get a certificate
1138160	1146000	to possibly, possibly open up like a little, so you might not know this. You know in salons,
1146080	1150400	like they have like a spare room. These rooms can be rented out for whatever you want.
1151040	1156400	And I was just thinking on the idea, like when, you know, time progresses, things,
1156400	1162160	things do their thing. I might have a pop up like little ASMR shop, but it's like just a little bed
1162160	1166560	in the room and it would just be so fun. And I love it because I am like genuinely passionate
1166560	1171280	about ASMR. Like I love the stuff about it. I've like tried to research some of the psychology.
1171280	1174800	I've came up with my own theories. Not everyone like agrees with my theories, but that's because,
1174800	1179600	you know, that's just what it is. But I think it would be a lot better. V sucky salon. Right,
1179600	1186080	you're done. You're done. You're done. You're done. Honestly, the skills you've learned running a
1186080	1195040	business is worth much more than the MBA. Well, you see skills, but literally I'm at the process
1195040	1201360	where I'm about to hand everything off now. Like I'm so freaking happy. And the only thing I need
1201440	1207520	to worry about is clippers. And there's the possibility for those of you who have an Oshi
1207520	1217680	desk and editing skills of the girls, I am 100% open like once things set up, because I know it
1217680	1220960	takes a while to kind of settle on an Oshi and be like, oh yeah, shit. Yeah, I'm going to watch her
1220960	1227360	consistently. If you have the time and if you're an editor, I am very open. If you wanted to be a
1227360	1234320	dedicated clipper or highlight editor for that girl, you're welcome to email the website.
1235440	1240000	Just to tell you right now, no, you do not get a open communication with a girl.
1241120	1246640	Everything is done through IWL messages. But yeah, if you really enjoy one of the girls and you
1246640	1252400	want to clip them or do highlight streams or funny moments type thing and want to get paid for it,
1252400	1258880	hit the website up because it saves me even more time because right now I'm today after the short
1258880	1265600	stream, I'm going to edit my 1k, thank you ASMR and then upload that. And then I'm going to send
1265600	1271440	away a few more clips for editing because the second guy we've got, poor guy, I've like left
1271440	1278240	him on red for like six days now and I'm like, oops. But yeah, I'm definitely gonna have to find a few
1278240	1283280	more clippers. I probably want to try two more clippers. But yeah, you don't like Vsucky, so you
1283280	1289440	would say that Vsucky blows honestly. But yes, there's opportunities. Like please don't think
1289440	1294400	that this is like a super closed off like thing. Like I'm happy to tell you about what the process
1294400	1300560	is like when it comes to clips. Like the reason why subtitles kind of jump at you in clips is
1300560	1306320	because that's what gets the monkey side of your brain to like keep watching. The editor for Mercy's
1306320	1311760	recent clip, I forgot to put credit in the blonde one. You can edit credit in the description.
1312720	1318640	Right, I need to do that. Mercy has a new short coming out and the way the editing style is just
1320240	1327680	captures the ADHD perfectly. It has insider knowledge about VTubers and like just really happy
1327680	1334800	with it. So if you can edit what Mercy's recently published clips are like, feel free to hit the
1334800	1344480	website up. I'm needing a few more clippers. I'm needing to get Sheeby needs clips very badly. I
1344480	1352000	need to put up. However, there's like so many little notes. I'm like, so I've told the girls to
1352000	1359680	cover up your for now. Like as you can see, you can only see my deck leotage at the moment,
1359680	1363920	because I'm a bit worried about what the heck's going on with YouTube right now.
1363920	1367840	I feel like there's still policy of these going, but that's just me. But right, let me finish this
1367840	1371760	team. We'll actually jump into the game because I have been yapping for 20 minutes. I'm not even
1371760	1378560	stop. Oh, that's ridiculous. Sorry. I'm so sorry. Goodness gravy. Once I get started, I can't stop.
1378560	1387920	20 freaking two minutes. That is terrible. Are you looking for clippers? If you look on
1387920	1394240	Mercy's most recent short, if you can do clips like that, that's pre made stuff where I just send
1394240	1398960	you the model and the audio and then you do the subtitling and all the other fancy like
1401280	1407920	then yes, definitely apply. If you mean clipping highlight sections in general, I again,
1408640	1411200	I'm going to I'm going to see what happens after a girl to stream.
1411680	1419760	Okay, I finished my tea. I came for the yapping. Honestly, don't worry. There's two
1419760	1426320	point. I was like half yapping, but it's so fun. Yes. Okay. What is this game about? Good question.
1426320	1434640	I actually don't know. So all I know is it's called needy streamer overload. I believe it is one girl
1435360	1442960	and there's a ton of different endings that we can potentially get. So we're going to check it out,
1442960	1447280	see how it is. I believe it's a click simulator. So I can't get annoyed at the gameplay because
1447280	1453120	this is my kind of thing like nice chill, doing my things. Veal over the company competition is
1453120	1460080	actually just who's the biggest yapper. Honestly, 20 minute talking, no gameplay. Honestly, this
1460080	1464560	game is each of our life simulators. Actually, okay, that's good. That's good. I was going to
1464560	1474080	play YouTube simulator and then I was going to call it like well, real or fail. Okay. Okay,
1474080	1483440	so there's day progressions. Okay. Okay, you ready? Welcome day one of five.
1484400	1491200	Man the way. No. Got the stream account. Time to log in and get ready. Click on stream and

1526880	1533280	matter what happens online. Whether I die or I get arrested or I break or I get stabbed or I get
1533280	1539840	flamed or I become god or go crazy. Virginia, thank you for the tip as well. That's got to
1539840	1545280	happen. The main reason I'm here for overall, thank you for the tip. We'll be together no matter
1545280	1551840	what happens. Oh, the internet is truly the festering cesspool of heck born from modern society.
1553120	1559360	But even so, I have nowhere else to turn to. Are you squidding me right now? Dr Resurgence,
1559360	1563680	thank you for the tip. You're awesome and I love your accent. Thank you so much for the tip. I appreciate
1563680	1568400	it because I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning. I don't want to get out. I don't want
1568400	1576480	to get a proper job. No, she's a need. No. I'm scared of other people. Adults pee me off and I'm
1577280	1584480	bum bum. I'm dumb dumb. And I still want everyone to fawn over me. She wants to be an idol and
1584480	1590400	streamers get fawned over and the most over the most right now. Oh god, everyone knows I can't
1590400	1597600	read. So that's why I want to be one. Thanks for sizing up all my gear and getting my stream
1597600	1606080	software running. Pete Chan. My name's Pete. Heck yeah, my name's Pete. When I send you a DM,
1606080	1611120	you can sometimes pick your own reply. When the time comes, make sure you think long and hard
1611120	1620240	about what to say. Pete Chan. Pete Chan. Yep, you're my Pete Chan because you're so, oh,
1621040	1626640	wait, we're the manager. We're the manager. I mean, you're the only, this is the people that have
1626640	1630000	been emailed on the website. That's all I'm going to say when they're like, I want to be a talent
1630000	1633440	manager and they have no thanks. I mean, you're the only person in the world who understands and
1633440	1638560	supports me and you're my one true love and you're also like my producer so fit. Oh, that's
1638560	1644080	so freaking smart. Okay, you're super smart. No, you're super smart for naming me unlike me. So
1644080	1648800	you can guide me. You can tell me or anything and I'll do it. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do
1648800	1652720	this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Oh,
1652720	1661440	it's almost time. My makeup looks good. Got my wig. Perfect. Here we go. Here we go. It's time
1661440	1678560	for my first and go. Wait, this is late. Wait, this is good though. That would not have been cheap to
1679440	1683200	do.
1697200	1708400	Nice, cheery, cute. What? Stream is usual.
1708720	1713440	As usual. God, you're so cute. Cute. Kawaii ne. All right, so we're playing mod simulator
1713440	1719600	on ironical. Wait, YouTube mod simulator. Choosing comments. No.
1722480	1723280	Weird name.
1723440	1725440	Weird name.
1732800	1736960	Array of light illuminating the chaotic internet of today.
1740240	1744720	Bringing happiness to the nerds floating in this electronic sea.
1748720	1749760	Can I type myself?
1749840	1755920	Wait, so she gets stressed if I miss stuff? Oh boy, here come the nerds in the comment.
1758720	1768240	We're all here just to vibe. So don't be mean. We're all just here to vibe. There's no point
1768240	1771120	of just starting calling each other nerds. We're all just trying to enjoy ourselves.
1771120	1774640	A promise of future peace. I'm a little manic and moody, but that's all right.
1774640	1781440	Don't go depression on us. Is that mean? I don't know if it's mean or not. I wouldn't care.
1782560	1789360	I feel like I'm deleting all the comments. Go get therapy. No, right. No, don't be mean too hard.
1789360	1798640	The internet angel has descended. Thank you for gracing us. Cheers. Yeah, read it. Oh,
1798640	1807760	I can tell her to read it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Huh. We got a little Minecraft.
1813360	1823680	Wait, wait, wait. Get out of here. No, don't read it. Delete it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
1823680	1833280	delete it. You silly sausage. No, don't delete it. Why? Oh, what was that?
1838240	1844080	Or do I tailor to? Okay, I don't. For goodness sake. I'm a rubbish mod, honestly. So when you're
1844080	1848160	going to show it, see, I would leave that in because I've been like, I've got bikini models.
1849120	1855680	I'm the terrible mod. I feel like I don't mind. If it's a way for you to get your stuff out,
1855680	1861760	I'm sure. And while I'm at it, I'm going to be the biggest streamer on YouTube. That's a threat
1861760	1866400	and a promise. Oh, my God. Threaten is more Kangol. Is it Kangol or K-Angel? I feel like
1866400	1871920	Kangol sounds like Kigo. Right, group Kigo exercises replaying. You've got my support.
1871920	1879680	Go back or go home. So I'm going to shoot for a million. Jesus, lady. You've got my support. Yeah.
1880480	1889520	K-Angel, Kawaii Angel. Oh, Pepega. She literally, an interesting newbie has appeared. No one even
1889520	1895120	freaking types newbie like that. That's ridiculous. Show us what you've got, baby.
1895360	1901680	Hmm. Hmm. Anyway, there's still a lot I have to. Anyway, there's still a lot I have to learn,
1901680	1905840	but I'm still going to be here. I can't wait to meet you all. I think that's what she sounds like.
1905840	1910800	Nice to meet you. To meet you. Nice. Time for a challenge.
1913840	1915360	Thank you for greeting us.
1916320	1927840	I'm K-Angel. Get out of here. Oops. I don't think I was supposed to do it. You get out of here.
1930080	1934320	Oh, and if you're a backseat gamer, do me a favor and stay away please. Well,
1934320	1938640	what's wrong with freaking getting your hand held? They're games. Nice to meet you. Subscribbled.
1939200	1943680	The birth of a legend. First stream complete. At the end of the stream, I will respond to the
1943680	1951680	comments you choose. The fans love that, so aren't I so kind and generous? I guess. Twitter.
1952400	1956000	Hi, everyone. Wow, this is my first. This is my first time meeting all of you.
1956000	1959920	I'm only going to each one. You're Internet Angel. What did you guys think of my first
1959920	1970960	stream? I hope you like it. Oh, I can't read that fast. Jesus. Oh my God. Oh my God. I'm still
1970960	1975520	shaking. Did you like my performance on stream though? So when she, her voice is deep here,
1976480	1980880	K-Angel finally descended upon the world after we spent so long mulling over it. We've got a
1980880	1985280	thousand more subscribers, huh? But that's not enough. I want more people to fawn over me.
1985280	1997520	We're only just getting started. I like the bunches. Best design. I need at least one million fans to
1998160	2005040	satisfy my desperate need for approval. That's crazy dialogue. I wonder what Dev team made this.
2005040	2012000	We got to get that. We got to, we got to get to that within our month. That's the most motivation
2012000	2017680	I've got. Oh, she's done it in a month. So let's get this, let's make this month count.
2017680	2022320	Okay, we have 30 days. We can make K-Angel the biggest streamer in the world if we work together,
2022320	2033760	right? Uh, uh, yeah. Yup. I love you so much. Oh my God. I really hope we can pull this off.
2033760	2040640	I'm counting on you. We're going to make it happen. It's her dream. We have to make it happen. I might
2040640	2046400	break if you push me too hard, but when that happens, we can just destroy the internet.
2047040	2056720	And anyway, I'll be counting on you tomorrow too. Good night.
2059120	2063040	Wow. Okay, so it's a 30-day sim. Okay, okay. Day two. Day two. All right, all right.
2064000	2068320	Good morning. It's my first morning as an official streamer. Wait, it's already noon.
2069280	2071280	Uh, I'm just not a morning person at all.
2075840	2079440	I was a bit, I was a bit too slow on that. Oh, well, anyway, since we're aiming for one
2079440	2089840	million subscribers, we still need 999,000 more. But first, let's start small and go for 10k first.
2089840	2097360	We'll get there in no time. And as you know, I'm completely useless on my own.
2099280	2105200	Haha. So you need to tell me what to do every day. I know you'll make the reddit, right? Is this
2105200	2112080	terrible of me to say? But as like a manager point of view, that's actually super easy to direct
2112080	2119760	people like this. Like, just tell me what to do and I'll do it. So I'll do everything you tell me.
2119760	2125360	Really, I have complete faith in you, P-chan. I'll follow all your orders perfectly and I promise
2125360	2132240	I'll become the best streamer. Literally, I like feel so bad. But like, this is like the perfect
2132240	2141280	employee. Because if not, I think I'll break and fall apart or I could break you. I don't want to
2141280	2148240	be weak. Oh, fuck it. I'm fucking her. I could break you myself. Yeah, you could. Oh my, wait,
2148240	2157040	she reciprocates. Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my penis typed that on the keyboard.
2158320	2165680	I'm sorry, I couldn't. I'm sorry. Please don't be creeped out by a manager. Right,
2165680	2174800	how do I tell her? Are we done? Hang out. Oh, okay, okay, hang out. New idea incoming.
2174800	2182800	Sleep. New idea incoming. New... medication. Oh dear, that's not good. Oh, she feels okay.
2184480	2195040	So I'm definitely mental darkness. Wow, okay. Oh wait, what does that say? Collect ideas. Okay.
2196960	2204560	I comprehend. To collect ideas, I want you to search the internet for the current Twitter trend.
2204880	2211760	Of a VTuber model. Social media puts her stress up. Oh,
2213280	2225840	pre-streamer, vanity search. No, don't do that. Video streaming? No. What's ST? I don't know.
2226960	2232480	Dender. No, you don't need dender hen. Go follow the latest VTuber trend. I don't care what it is,
2232480	2238000	but go do it for me, darling. Someone I met for the first time today told me you looked like you
2238000	2247120	would be really into underground male idols. Do I really? The task manager will show you...
2249280	2252400	I'm learning, I'm learning. Conspiracy theories are always so interesting to read about. It's so
2252400	2258560	funny seeing people argue about whether they're real or absolute BS. I never get tired of it.
2258640	2270400	Okay, okay. You're actually so smart. I don't... Idea gone. But you know, I feel like if you go
2270400	2274480	deep enough, you'll end up buying into it sooner or later. Curiosity killed the cat kind of deal.
2274480	2279840	Well, I'm fine though. I never let that happen to me. I'm the most rational and logical girl in
2279840	2285360	the world and the only thing that drives me crazy is you. Okay, if it's reciprocated love, then I
2285360	2292880	don't feel bad about being weird. But anyway, I figured that conspiracy theories would make
2292880	2299680	for great content, so let's start this off with a banger. Okay, okay. We can only stream once with
2299680	2304800	the idea we get from commands marked with an exclamation mark. If we stream with a low-level
2304800	2311920	idea, we'll be able to find another idea on the next level up. Comprehend, yes. Go to dust.
2312480	2320800	Is that my only choice? I don't really want to cross route. Okay, it's making me go to dust.
2323600	2330240	I think I messed up your medifix recommendation because I was using your account to watch stuff.
2330240	2335280	I'm sorry. That's fine. We just... Wait, you can't stream... Do you actually need to go to bed?
2335600	2343360	Is she tired already? Do you need to sweep, little one? Or do you need to go again?
2345520	2349840	You want to do internet again? Pre-stream alert goes up. Our stress...
2350960	2359520	It will change time tonight. Okay, okay. I wanted to buy myself a super comfy couch,
2359520	2363600	but if I did that, I think I would never leave it. I think it would turn into a blob.
2364560	2369760	Go to night, and then she can stream. So she can stream at night. Can I want to dye my hair pink
2369760	2377520	something? I think even more people would love me if I did that. Pink is definitely an idle hair
2377520	2384960	colour for VTubers. Very common. I actually didn't want pink VTuber, but I think we'll
2384960	2392000	definitely have a pink one in general, let's be honest. Right, chat and chill. All hail the internet.
2392000	2398880	I think Zatsu. So this is her doing her 2.0, so we'll do Zatsu. Begin. Transform!
2405200	2411520	Honestly? I'm digging this so far. This has already blown me out of expectation out of the war.
2413120	2416480	Okay, very, very, very. Stream speed as usual.
2417200	2423840	Hi cuties! I'm the internet angel. Okay, angel. I kind of sound like, um,
2424640	2427440	what the heck, the rabbit from Sonic Heroes?
2429600	2434480	Why does she always say bless or whatever? Eh, clearly because she's...
2435440	2438720	You're blessed to have her in our life? You're so quiet. You're super cute.
2439600	2452560	I love the internet because all of the lovely people are willing to listen to you alone and
2452560	2461520	other attention whores. Parish! Why, angel? Thank you for your super chat. I love you.
2461520	2464320	I keep reading that as Kigo. I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
2464320	2468880	Oh my biggest fear is the end and then I can imagine living a life not being needed by anymore.
2471600	2479280	No, this is too real. Oh no, we're about to put on Mr. Kitty as the hours pass on the
2479280	2484800	little notes that I hear. She sure is bold for a new streamer.
2485040	2491280	Do I need to speed this up?
2499200	2504800	She says she loves me. She loves me? She loves me now. She loves me. I don't know about the rest
2504800	2510800	of you, but your face sure is cute. Okay, well, I love it. This is the true mod experience. Honestly,
2511520	2521440	can I speed this up? No, I can. I guess. No takebacks now. Chin hands. Oh, this is chin hands?
2522320	2529600	This pose? I got Mercy have chin hands toggle. Because it's all over if you get bored of me
2529600	2534720	and I don't want to die yet. Let's go! I'm going to need water so quickly if I'm
2535520	2541360	I didn't bring any more. Please don't die. Please don't die. Oh no.
2544720	2547920	I'm bored. Why would you super tip? I'm bored.
2551920	2558880	Let's have a look. See why Angel? I kind of messed up the super chats, but I've always been an Angel
2558880	2564480	since I was born because I'm just too kawaii. Please don't die.
2567600	2572160	People die and whether I live or die is all up to my bet. Whoa, stay there.
2575040	2580800	Oh, well, you are streamed. Thanks to everyone who came along to stream today. Sorry, I was
2581440	2586720	too new to this. Love you all. I never caught on days when
2588000	2592000	Kegel streams. I'm so good. I can't read it. Right, Daisy, Daisy.
2598000	2604960	Dear P-chan, this is Saito from the bit creations. As per our last phone call,
2604960	2609760	your rent is still outstanding and you will have to pay. You have until the 10th to pay for it.
2609760	2613440	Oh my god, I'm going to get kicked out. Please forward your payment to the account details below
2613440	2618480	and contact me when you've done so. Regards. Please reply to this email with any concerns.
2619600	2626800	I'm sorry. What is this? Does this mean we need to pay all our rent by day 10? We're broke as heck.
2626800	2632560	We need to be able to monetize our content ASAP. We need to get more than 10k followers first.
2632560	2637840	Easy peasy for us. Let's go. Yes, yes, yes. Oh my god, you're such a hard worker. What the heck
2637840	2648080	is that though? That little bear thing. Right, I need you to... Your stress is really high.
2649360	2661040	How do I de-stress you? Hang out. Play game. Stress goes down by five... No, that's number four. That's
2661840	2669120	Four. Affection goes up between us. I don't want her to have to... What's this? Spend time together.
2669680	2679280	Her affection goes up and her stress goes down by six units though. I think we'll do that. No,
2679280	2687680	she needs... Wait. Wait, hold on. It says dot, dot, dot. Love is in the air. Stress goes down
2687680	2692400	significantly but mental darkness... Mental darkness goes down, affection goes up and stress
2692400	2699360	goes down. This is a win-win. This is the most po- like this is the best thing to make her feel
2699360	2713600	better. Sorry, but... Is that that game where it's like 120 levels? I promised to never portray you
2713600	2725360	guys, so please keep on showing me all your love. Oh, nori. Nori Nelly. Uh, what taken? No, what?
2726000	2729120	This shows how much pressure I'm feeling. I might start acting weird if I get too high,
2729120	2737440	so watch out. I may even become more scared of the internet by the day. Uh, this displays how much
2737440	2741840	I love you. I'd be sad if I don't love you enough but if I love you too much it might be hard to
2741840	2748880	handle to try and strike a good balance. This lets you know how I'm doing mentally, how well I cope
2748880	2754000	with reality will change depending on the numbers. It might have a bigger influence over my future
2754000	2764480	rather than in your future. Uh, show me one hate. Show me one hate or who bothers to wear clothes
2764480	2769280	that fit them properly. That's the most bizarre thing I've ever read. Uh, we're definitely gonna
2769280	2780560	have to research tomorrow. Uh, we'll do conspiracies. Why are you now? Transform! Time for her voice to
2780560	2789760	go like this. Men here have each of her simulator. Is that how it goes? I know there's lots of end
2789760	2798160	ends there. The fixer of who controls them? What is that even mean? First time here.
2802320	2806640	Oh wait, no, sorry. I'm reading parts in the voice app. I'm not supposed to.
2807600	2815600	Do you guys like conspiracy theories? I know, I do. Have I read about them? But why?
2818320	2825920	Young nerds love these. That's American viewer spot. Annihilate this man.
2829120	2834480	Is this supposed to go faster than this? Oh, I love conspiracy theories. I'm excited, yes.
2835440	2845040	Okay, do you like conspiracy? So, I can... Oh, that's going too fast. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2845040	2850240	Today I'll be talking about their culture conspiracy theories. Like the freaking, is it the ET game
2850240	2856400	that's like currently, um, dug into like a ditch and it's like 40,000 worth of games or something?
2856400	2863200	Some people say that I... Oh, this is going too fast. They wanted to do the Japanese masses
2863200	2868880	into nerds to numb them. Sounds wacky, but what if it did happen? I'm not a nerd.
2871840	2875280	Uh, I think we'll do a nicer super chat. I think we could do a super chat that makes
2875280	2879040	her happier than that. But then people get mad if you don't read them out.
2880480	2885520	Everyone watching now would be dancing to the tune of Three Minds Fonds.
2887440	2890640	Feels like you're going to eventually go off the descent if you...
2891520	2894000	What? Talking about conspiracies?
2894720	2897920	But it's okay, because even if you were off this...
2901040	2907840	I can't, I can't, I couldn't even moderate it. I'm not a nerd. I just want to know this what a nerd
2907840	2912640	says and she's gone just like that. Jeez, right. I'm not clicking that speed up option. My goodness,
2912640	2916960	what was that? You upped the stream speed, but I've tried to lure it, did I not?
2917920	2925200	Wait, is this her all? I will shiitake mushroom y'all on my privilege will all and will.
2925200	2930240	As long as one finds that they can stay blissfully unaware and even if someone does find it,
2930240	2933440	it's not like I'm committing a crime, even though it does feel like we're really just...
2933440	2940720	Wait, so this is her all. Oh, and this is her main. Oh, that's a shame. She doesn't enjoy streaming.
2942160	2946080	Then you do it then. So, but you didn't have to stream if you didn't like it.
2946160	2948800	I don't know why we're... Can you write some good stuff about
2949760	2957120	thingy on ST for me? I think it'll be too obvious if I do it myself, so please.
2961440	2963200	Medication gives her an idea.
2964880	2965840	Diazipam?
2970000	2972960	One milligram Diazipam makes her floppy.
2973840	2982400	Brof. Brof. It's five milligrams that'll make you floppy, Hen. It's not one milligram.
2982400	2985760	One milligram does nothing. That's a tiddly wink of Diazipam.
2987520	2992320	It's someone who's got the anxiety maze. I assure you, it's five milligrams when you're
2992320	2998880	gonna feel it. Right, I am going to let her get a new idea by playing games. She used to play some
2998880	3005600	games. She's a lightweight, literally. All you need is a beat a blocker and you're good to go,
3005600	3011840	and if you're really not good to go, Diazipam. I hit my gacha a bunch of already. We just paid
3011840	3017360	money for that. Did you just spend money when we have to pay rent? Nothing beats a good games.
3018560	3022640	Humans were born to play, and I'm getting the hang of this streaming thing, so I want to do
3022640	3027360	a let's play. Let's do this. Yeah, that's exactly what you're supposed to do. Why are these reactions
3027360	3032800	so scuffed? You have a new idea for stream. Let's play throwback stream. Hey, that's what I did!
3033600	3041440	Go dusk, go dusk. Right, you can play again. I want you. I need you. I need you. I need you.
3041440	3050720	I love you. I love you. Atama no naka. I don't know what the tune is, but I've probably heard it
3050720	3055360	if it's that popular Japanese. I'll let her play twice so she can get two game things.
3058240	3060080	Need to grind, need to grind, need to grind, need to grind.
3062560	3067120	So I put a stress by four and affection up, but I didn't do anything. I just remember this game
3067120	3072080	I played when, where you become a big shot, who is a global influencer or whatever, I actually got
3072080	3077440	so into it, I ended up skipping it. What game is that I referenced to? I just remember this game
3077760	3087360	becomes some big shot who has global influence. What game? That must be a reference, but it's so
3087360	3092480	generic. But anyway, I know it's recently a lot of people these days like to play games where you
3092480	3099040	have to rule, power to rule the world and even reduce population and stuff. What are these references to?
3099040	3108000	They must be references to. Is the game, it's referencing itself? Oh, Pepega. That's very plausible.
3108800	3114480	And some people also truly believe that's what's happening in our world and make up these wild
3114480	3122000	boogie men to direct their rage at. Wait, is this because I looked up that conspiracy stuff she's
3122000	3126080	saying this? I don't blame them though. I think considering the times we live in, it's not so
3126080	3132800	strange that people want someone or something to be angry at. Not as, not as dissect in human
3132800	3138240	nature. Hold on, this game is, I love it already. What the heck, we're like human nature, but we
3138240	3142240	should all be working together. Please, this is my only wish as an internet angel. Wait,
3142240	3147600	Bob, I'm, I'm eating this up for breakfast. Like, I love the intricate like one human nature that
3147600	3152960	you need something to do. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, I'm going to say that and see how the
3152960	3163680	Schumer's react. They are my, girl, do not bite the hand that feeds my goodness. Oh no,
3163680	3169680	she was talking about theories. I didn't, only one cover. Wait, am I going to turn her into a
3169680	3178320	politician? Can I turn her into anti-migrant factor? Please, can I turn her into our
3178320	3188640	migrant factor? Stop, stop anti-migrant factor. Let's go. E-girl anti-migrant factor. We believe
3188640	3196320	in the public owning the fricking things and the private sector does not own or have stakes
3197120	3202960	and that the people do not buy out mistakes, buy out companies that go bust because it's not the
3202960	3209120	people's problems for the private companies. Oh my god, yes! Revolution, yes! Oh my god,
3209120	3216480	this game's amazing. Hi guys, it's Chloe Angel, the Napoleon of the Streaming Wall. Who's Napoleon?
3216480	3220240	Right, not you. That's a terrible super chat and you should be embarrassed, but we'll put it in
3220240	3229360	because we can take it out. No way we can do this. In 30 years, our world could be ruled by one body,
3229360	3233440	or so. Oh, we're too late for that. Conglomerates are screaming too cr- Wait, let's turn-
3235200	3242240	Wait, I can't turn it off. Uh, what's a conglomerate? I've done another rabbit hole. The division has
3242240	3247760	already begun. Oh, I haven't long ago. Conglomerates are scheming. They're even trying to reduce the
3247760	3253840	world population to one billion. That's scary. I want to live in an equal society. I'll put it in
3253840	3257040	because it's super chat, but we'll see if we can replace it with something else. What would the
3257040	3261600	world be like ruled by one government? I don't know how I feel about worshiping a fallen angel,
3261600	3267760	being an angel myself. Lucifer, hold that guy. You can be my fo- You can be my fallen angel. Sorry,
3267760	3274720	this is a chat. Keep fricking doing it wrong. Uh, I'm already taking action. You frown your face
3274720	3283440	is so kawaii ne. Is there any mean comments? I don't think I've seen any mean comments.
3284400	3289680	Like, literally we're playing the Biden number Isaac right now. We've got, uh, biblical references.
3293920	3298080	I'm kind of curious about that kind of world. Okay, we'll put that in.
3299520	3307840	Wow. I assume if I don't, like, if I skip this, I miss out on, like, she might get stressed.
3308560	3312960	I'll have a peek at the comments. That's scary. I want to live in an equal society. Yeah,
3312960	3316640	but then just sitting around and complaining isn't going to change anything. We must fight.
3316640	3323440	No way we're fricking starting a revolution as an e-girl, please. Yes, you can, uh, I shall be the
3323440	3332480	new, I'll be the new god of this world. Yes! Oh my god. Yes. How do I make her do more of this?
3332560	3340800	This is amazing. Oh my god. Oh no, it makes her shaky though. Oh, I don't want her to be upset.
3342720	3345760	You know what we're doing? You're always bound to end up fighting one way or another.
3345760	3349680	Those who do not fight will not survive. Look at my DM and stop ignoring me.
3350480	3357600	I'm sorry. Where's your webcam? Oh, sorry. Oh, I thought I can head pattern.
3358160	3363040	Kind of. Obviously, the first thing you gotta check that you can touch next is the section,
3363040	3369200	but hey ho. Oh, I can't head pattern. Take that. Yeah, you like that. Yeah, head pattern. Okay.
3369200	3374480	I don't think I can talk to you right now. I've just been focusing on your career, so it's fine.
3377760	3384880	Alex Jones feature for art. I want her to, like, take over the world. I'm going to make
3384880	3388800	an Amazon wishlist. What should I put in it? Bath bomb costume and expensive mic.
3388800	3395200	I'll produce that. Expensive mic. The people need to hear your words. All right. That's it. Yes.
3395200	3402240	The people need to hear you. So not Kawaii. Oh my god. You're so Kawaii. Oh, she's blushing.
3402880	3410960	So not cute. Okay. Okay.
3414080	3418080	If this is you complaining about me not interacting with you, my lady,
3418080	3422400	I have to say this is the most rubbish interaction I've ever seen before.
3423200	3428160	We are sending each other emojis and that's it. You're done. How do I make you do that thing again?
3429120	3434160	How is, what was the one that made her get that row? I want her to do that row more.
3435280	3439600	Her stress, oh, her stress is 61? Oh, that's so high.
3442080	3445040	Her mental darkness goes up on social media. I don't want that.
3449520	3454640	Daisling stops call makes you feel as a streamer's voice is a lifeline, but it'll take too many
3454640	3459120	and or stuff will happen. Okay. Everything just feels more manageable and it makes you feel kind
3459120	3468320	of floaty. Do we pop one? Fuck it. We'll pop it. What happens to her stress levels?
3472560	3479920	Madame. Madame. Madame. You did not have to post that on the main account. So her stress went,
3479920	3485040	wait, that was it. The stress went down by one. That was pathetic. Don't ever do that again. That
3485040	3494400	was rubbish. Oh my God. She's high as a kite. You are in no state. Is this this jump scare here
3494400	3503440	as well? You're in no state to stream. Yeah, you're in no straight. That was useless. You're not looking
3503440	3510080	at my DMs as quickly as you used to. Do you care about my girlfriend? We got rent to make, honey.
3510080	3516400	Get them Yurizou. I love you, but get them Yurizou. What are you talking about? Right. How did I get
3516400	3523360	her to do that? Come on, become a politician. Go on social media. Oh, wait, I think you just put
3523360	3529280	her stress up more. I'm really bad at this game. It feels like everyone is low on age. Is it because
3529280	3533920	of something they did? Also, please remember the streamer people too. Oh my God, I see that tweet
3533920	3538400	like all the time. Honestly, this game's pretty meh. I have to admit, like, I don't know, tweets like.
3539680	3545680	But then, wait, so how do I progress? I want more of this one. Take a dive into conspiracy world.
3548080	3552800	I'm not allowed to do it. Or am I allowed to do it? No, I think it regurgitates the stream,
3552800	3558880	so you can't do that. The next idea for conspiracy is on internet video streaming.
3558880	3565920	Okay, let's do a throwback to a game. I needed her stress is getting pretty bad. We're over 50%.
3566640	3573840	We're at 56% stress levels. Oh, I didn't mean to skip that, but I did. Oopsies. You got a lot more
3573840	3578080	stream ideas. Hey, cuties, I'm fine. It's time for me to come. Nice never gets old.
3580400	3586160	As usual. We're going to check out some truly ancient artifacts today. Well, like Assassin's
3586160	3592960	Creed Brotherhood. Goodness, gravy. I love games. I'm excited. What games are you playing?
3594320	3599440	The chat would like to know. Hey, I'm just doing my algebra while listening to she's back.
3600400	3606800	It's such a good adaptation. See, this is so slow, but the next thing is so fast.
3608240	3614640	Can I make her gamers? Let's go. That's right. Gamers are the most pressed and play some flash games.
3615280	3618240	Oh, I don't even remember any flash games, to be honest.
3621280	3625920	Um, fancy pants. I think it's the only flash game I remember playing.
3626800	3629520	He had like a mohawk and it was just like a 2D.
3630800	3635760	You look like you suck at games. And you look like you swallow at games,
3635760	3642800	you nasty. Thanks for the five. Going to a rent. Don't know what's going on, but I like it. Yes.
3644240	3649840	As long as you're enjoying yourself. What a lovely freaking chat she's got already.
3650640	3654400	Although her design is like, wow, this takes me back. This
3655360	3662560	site should be the one. Wait, huh? Don't TOS yourself. Don't TOS. What are you opening?
3662560	3668560	Are you all right? What's wrong? Oh, it's so old that support has ended and we can't play. Girl,
3668560	3674640	you're supposed to pre-open the game before string for this reason. Of course, literally.
3675360	3682320	That's actually in one of my rule books for the girls. I gave them a document and it said,
3682320	3687040	please open the game before stream to make sure you know it works and have backup games immediately.
3687680	3691600	Yep, there is folks. No, that was rude, I think. You're so silly. That's cute.
3693200	3696880	Lol, this is, this was more interesting actually. Okay, okay.
3698240	3701760	I literally, in the document, I'm like, please open. I'm like, don't cry.
3702240	3705360	Stop pandering to the old fucks on the internet.
3706880	3712640	Are we ages out here? Hold on a minute. I'm not. You're not reading that. That's not nice.
3716240	3720400	That's not nice. Or should I put it in there and then she'll address it?
3720400	3725280	Possibly. I'll put it in so she addresses it and she's like, we're not ages out here.
3725280	3727920	Like, we're just here having a good time, you know what I'm saying? It's okay, there's
3728080	3733760	all the same. You're lucky you're so pretty. You're lucky. No. Yeah, either you spawned in,
3733760	3737040	okay? You didn't pick the coordinates. You didn't pick what's going on. All right,
3737040	3741920	maybe I shouldn't have done that one. Oh, I don't know. Don't cry. Don't cry.
3744160	3748240	There are only three situations where it is appropriate for a woman to cry.
3750160	3755680	All right. When you get dumped, when you lose your wallet, and when your child's at Flash Games,
3755680	3761200	get discontinued. Sorry, I've got warrable if you can hear me rubbing that.
3761200	3763360	Stop entering to the old folks on the internet.
3765040	3769680	Shut up, my little lips. That's a cool way. It doesn't matter what age and gender.
3769680	3772080	Okay, yeah, she's sure I'm done. That's what I'm talking about.
3773840	3777200	So much for our first game stream. That's all for today, I guess.
3777920	3782880	Bless. Welcome to the house of Bless. Okay.
3790160	3794800	Well, that's it. What can you do? Things are only just getting started,
3794800	3799600	so I have to try even harder from now. Come on, I said stop ignoring me.
3799600	3805520	I'm 500 times more needed. Can I like like these so she knows I'm not ignoring her?
3807600	3811920	I don't know. My fiction 50. Our stress is so high.
3813760	3817520	We need to do something about that. We need to do something about our stress today.
3818560	3823760	I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky. Right. For your stress, go and...
3826080	3828000	Our stress goes way down.
3831200	3836400	And the fiction goes way up. But the thing is the stress goes down by like
3837280	3843520	what number difference is that? Eight? Whereas the stress goes down by six on that one.
3843520	3846560	I'm sorry, but a way... Oh wait, I need to talk to her. Sorry.
3846560	3849440	My new microphone's here. People have been calling about the sense, so this is really good.
3849440	3855040	Maybe I should take it with me to karaoke. Oh my god, yeah, I want to hear you sing,
3855040	3863120	baby girl. It's lovely time. Oh my god, you're so cute. I'm dead. This is so cute.
3864000	3870640	We'll be together in our next... Oh, are we doing afterlife? Yeah, yeah,
3870640	3875680	together in our afterlife. You believe in that stuff? Okay, right. To bed you go.
3875680	3880320	Go do your thing, baby girl. Let's get that stress level done, because I'm getting nervous.
3880320	3891600	I'm getting shaky. Wow, some... What's something you guys are really into these days? Minus the secret.
3891600	3897520	I love everything about... I feel like my brain's gonna leak out of my heat from
3897520	3902640	how good it feels. I'm gonna have... Right, we're at night. Wait, we're at night already?
3902640	3907360	Oh, for goodness sake. One day we'll be one of those couples that can afford to call a taxi
3907360	3914560	to go wherever we want. That is so specific. Yeah, oh my god, I would love that. Yeah.
3915280	3924480	I'm afraid you need to stream, but her stress is so high. I never even got her to get a new...
3935760	3939760	I never got... Are you sure you want to proceed? You'll miss out on streaming at night,
3939760	3945280	but I can't. I'm out of idea. Wait, she actually can't just do a zatsu off the top of her head.
3949600	3953360	Wait, what am I supposed to do? Am I to send her to bed? What's going on?
3954880	3958480	I already forgot what I told her to do. Is she doing something? Hold on, don't you?
3960160	3968320	What are you... What are you doing? Are you doing something? Is she doing something?
3969200	3972720	You can give her head parts. Okay. Oh, wow, I didn't know that.
3975360	3981920	What on earth? I'm kind of tired. Thanks for always being so nice to me. Yeah.
3983280	3989520	I should carry on your spirit and be nice to my little nerds every once in a while. Okay.
3991280	3992800	How do I reduce your stress?
3993600	4004320	Sexy stream. Her first ASMR stream. Let's go. Go to tomorrow. So we can't do anything because
4004320	4010480	we're like out of time. Can I like head pattern until like some of the stats go down?
4012080	4015760	I think she's doing something. Honestly, I was like, what's going on? Oh,
4015760	4020480	we're on day seven. Rent's due soon. Hey, what color should I paint my nails?
4020480	4027360	Light blue, purple, rainbow, black. I want to say purple because of her hair streaks and
4027360	4033680	her alternative outfit. Light blue and red for her actual natural self though.
4038560	4042080	Light blue matches her natural self more. I know black is like the thing,
4042080	4046960	but she is going to have to dress up for her stream. Oh, she's actually doing as I say.
4047920	4051920	You're actually such a good girl. You're so clever. Good girl.
4054080	4056960	I did my nails, aren't they pretty? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I was,
4056960	4058720	yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like, it kind of matches.
4059600	4062320	Gee, it's not even me that likes the color.
4064320	4068800	Well, a new black, uh, found a new girl. I like more than you. I mean, yeah,
4068800	4072320	you get new Oshis all the time. You're allowed a new Oshie. You don't have to say I've allowed
4073040	4078480	though. Um, you know, some, right, stress. Oh, forget to sleep.
4080000	4084240	If she sleeps, sleep until tomorrow. A new idea if I sleep until tomorrow.
4088480	4092560	Okay, I'm just going to send her a bed. We have an ASMR stream plan for tonight.
4092560	4098400	She's going to sleep. Okay. She's going to sleep. Let her sleep. Right. ASMR time.
4098400	4105520	Get the mic out. Get licking it, young lady. Okay. Did I make myself clear? I want to get high.
4105520	4110560	Oh, I don't think we, I don't think we're allowed to condone that. Sorry, but no,
4110560	4114640	you're about to do an ASMR stream and we need to make sure it's YouTube terms of service safe.
4114640	4120400	Okay. So no, you're not allowed. Go do ASMR right now.
4120400	4124400	Oh, hold on.
4128160	4129680	I forgot to get a new warble.
4133440	4141520	Subsquibble. Any subscribers? First time. Hi cuties. I hope all of you nerds are going through it
4141680	4152080	today too. Going through it. Like the Mr. K is the always best. I want to die. Whoa.
4154000	4158000	I don't think I can allow that. Sorry. I have put my hand over my mouth and shock
4158000	4163200	because I didn't want to, like, I'm not a nerd. But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but,
4163520	4173920	but you're so good for always trying so hard. It's okay if you're chocolate.
4175920	4179840	Honestly, actually, I'm starting to agree. We're hold on a minute. She's actually kind of starting
4179840	4184880	to make sense. Like, sorry, but you actually have been told by the capitalist COGS that you
4184880	4188560	needs to be productive for every, here comes the most job or something. What? Eh.
4189440	4192240	You have been told that you need to be productive for every second of your life,
4192240	4195360	That's not true. You try harder than any of us
4199280	4206000	But personally I hate being told that just being alive is enough. It's just such an empty ass compliment
4206480	4210660	No, sorry, I'm disagreeing. Hold on a minute. Okay, Angel
4210660	4216400	You're starting to lose it get back on the politician bandwagon. I want you to take over earth right now
4216400	4218840	I feel that tell him I feel worse now
4219800	4226680	No, I feel like that's cathart. Is it car thorntic if someone like kind of just gets to vent and chat
4226680	4229440	I feel like that'll put her stress up though
4229640	4235200	But it's like cathartic to like put it out there to be like, you know what I'm feeling it, you know
4240480	4242480	Here we go, what is it?
4242880	4244880	Yo
4245120	4249440	I'll be your team yell. I'll be your team yell
4253560	4263200	Or smooch smooch is that what I'm supposed to say? I don't know what smooch you're my real life angel
4266680	4268680	Love
4274880	4276880	May that's what keep hanged off
4279920	4282440	I need stop I need stop. Can you take it off?
4285840	4289800	Yeah, we're gonna reduce that I give it a plus with my first kiss
4291720	4295160	I'm so happy then die
4295680	4302440	Thank you for the tip, but no, I'm not gonna
4303560	4307280	This pandering feels forced. It's weird. Is that gonna stress her out?
4311560	4317840	I think I think cuz we know she's role-playing it will thank you for this. Okay. That's much nicer. I
4319640	4324740	Don't want her to get stressed out cuz I'm already like struggling with her stress at the moment
4325160	4327160	She looks like Monka
4327800	4329800	Do it again, please. Oh, you're too cute
4330960	4335840	Yes, we're actually I don't know if we're gonna make rent. I'm gonna make you my girlfriend

4378520	4380920	They're all a thank-you kiss from you more
4382360	4385260	Why did she say that at the end of the stream?
4386720	4389680	Why would you say go die at the end of a super chat?
4392600	4394520	Whoa, I
4394520	4400520	Was so confused why she randomly came over that did you see he he did you all like what you saw the date?
4401120	4407160	If you did, let's play again tomorrow. What did some basic as pandering in my stats or skyro?
4407160	4412160	Oh, wow, I actually did our stress is so high after that
4413600	4417480	But the longest we around is a short sweet home right? I can't just ignore the girls
4418880	4422360	When you Twitter, I missed it. You guys are having
4426040	4428040	Overwhelming
4432240	4434240	Is that the end you need a head part
4437360	4445520	Is there a secret to the stress level thing I think I'm not achieving whatever it is. I don't want her to break I
4447120	4452480	Reach 10s. I want to do a celebration stream, but you know 10k is a nice number, but that's about it. Yeah, go for it
4452480	4457280	It's very I was actually speaking to the girls about this and the first step
4457280	4461360	I'm taking as a legendary angel, but I'm gonna get everyone to celebrate it and it takes back
4461360	4464240	You will love me for a little bit yandere. Yes, and
4464680	4470840	You have a new idea internet angel the internet and me thanks for taking okay that happened naturally

4480880	4482880	It drops
4485600	4489280	Wait to gaming over she gets a new idea if I do this
4490120	4492120	I don't know what the thing is
4493680	4496440	Rest and touching grass like a real streamer stress management
4496560	4501040	Literally, we need to like take her out and go meet gammie. So she meets gammie things just even out, you know

5034840	5036280	Yes
5036280	5037720	Yes

5068160	5074040	Your PC's can scan the layout of your house. Yes. I remember watching a talk show once in this guy
5074040	5076160	He was talking about an urban legend and another guest
5076160	5081040	So you got microchipped into you and then the guy was like I could tell you but then I'd have to kill you was the most
5081040	5082600	They're pan-faced ever
5082600	5086960	That was what made me look into this whole microchip business in the first place
5086960	5090680	I guess I want to talk about it because of how plausible it is
5091360	5092860	Yes
5092860	5095560	Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
5095560	5098480	Yes, I was so happy I wanted to be like on conspiracy not

5113040	5118000	Right, I just gonna de-stress her because we already know what she's gonna do
5119120	5122760	Who's her stress up to post on social media, which is such a shame
5123440	5125440	Mmm
5127040	5130880	Video streaming seems like such a safe thing to make her like less stressed
5130880	5135380	I'll do that and then we'll stream conspiracy theory. Oh
5136000	5140560	Tiny spiny. Thank you for the tip. It's work time for me against Ronnie, but enjoy the game

5144200	5148320	Unfortunately as a shorter stream, but yes have fun at work and thank you so very much for the kind tip
5148880	5155040	Appreciate it. Um, I love videos where the person just talks about what they like even better if you learn something new from it
5155040	5157040	Yes, agreed. I
5157480	5163480	May be a dumb dumb with mental issues and a horrific academic record. Wait, hold on a minute

5188520	5193400	Am I darling little nerds like and to do that? I guess I'll have to start at the very beginning with nerds themselves
5193400	5196520	And I've already done plenty of research on them. Let's do it
5198600	5204120	Okay, why are these oh my god? Yeah, you're so smart for coming up with these ideas baby girls stuffy time

5237960	5245520	Right, let's do it or stress goes up so much talking about these though her mental darkness goes up
5247320	5252880	But communication and rabbit hole go up so much though take a deep dive into the conspiracy of the world
5252880	5254720	But don't go too deep
5254720	5260360	But I want her to do it right. We're definitely gonna be on stress management, but
5261080	5263840	We're doing wait. Yeah. Yeah, we're doing it

5346680	5352560	No, I don't know the game seems pretty like the game seems pretty put well together any clicker. No
5355240	5361160	Nothing's happening imagine cities of people being controlled by microchips embedded from birth
5362800	5364800	Going into the deep end. Yeah

5408640	5410640	Wait until you learn about that time
5411280	5417600	The ruling class could manipulate our brainwaves as we like we don't use our puppets. Oh my god

5724160	5726160	But that's the best part
5726640	5728640	Okay, we're doing ASMR
5729040	5732160	I never thought about doing it in my k angel outfit for proud
5732720	5733920	I wait

5767600	5769600	Nocta can't lick
5770640	5774400	Jesus lying down and it's a super comfy

5784800	5788880	I'm freaking I would think I would get a cola and a water unironically
5789520	5792080	The words start mashing together if I read for too long
5792960	5800080	Our stress goes round and round. Is there any stream that doesn't put your stress up? Like I don't feel stressed when I stream. Is that bad?
5801600	5804720	Do we have to skip honestly? Do we have to skip?
5808480	5812320	I think we skip and do ASMR tomorrow
5814560	5820240	Um, no, not the medication. I don't think that's a good route for you darling because if you start relying on it
5820800	5823040	67 to watch
5824560	5826480	something
5826480	5829520	65 to play together or

5836240	5838960	Yeah, no stream. We'll do ASMR tomorrow. No stream
5840400	5842400	Let her take a day off. Yes
5842960	5846080	Can't really I stream every single day. So I'm not really sure what this is saying
5847200	5851360	If I ever find my special someone I want to go to the amusement park with them
5851600	5856720	We can scream to scream together. I scream together right the first rule. Why would you scream?
5857520	5863760	Oh an amusement park. Sorry. I thought I meant a park park like that one in New York City or something
5863760	5865760	I was like, why would you scream there?
5867120	5874640	Uh, I made up a p-chan. I made up a p-chan and then things got a bit what wait you made up. We fell out
5877440	5880560	It's cut is she like super lovey and dovey
5885120	5889200	Monetization oh she got monetization. Congrats. That's perfect. You're amazing
5890560	5894640	Ignoring you. No, you're not. You're literally freaking sending me emojis
5895600	5898800	Uh, we won't we won't get convict
5899440	5900800	evicted because
5900800	5906400	Those online nerds can pay for our rent. Jesus dodged a bullet there. I don't want to have us
5907680	5910240	To stream out on the streets might I really need a cola
5910800	5915120	I need a freaking I'm gonna go grab a cola in a war. I'll literally be a second. I'm like
5916800	5918800	Oh my god, I can't there's so many words the word
5918880	5920400	I don't know if you guys get this
5920400	5925920	But if you read for too long, all the letters start merging together and it's like it's really hard to take a
5926480	5930480	Like a context you of one heritage the actual word is
5941760	5945120	Period I don't know how you do it. Maybe you're a bit different though
5945600	5948800	And yes, I did just keep talking once I walked out there and probably didn't even hear me
5949200	5951760	I got my cola in the war. I'm going to take a little sipping tin
5952480	5953920	um
5953920	5955920	Put my blanket around me again
5956480	5959440	I'm actually wearing underwear today. I can't believe it
5960000	5961680	It's a christmas miracle
5961680	5966640	But I'm not wearing a hoodie. I've just got my my blanket like a like a poncho like a poncho
5971200	5976160	These streams are always a blast to watch. Yeah, are you ready for the rabbit hole route ending?
5976560	5980080	I actually kind of I'm interested to see what the other
5980720	5984720	Endings are. I don't think I'm going to do the other ending
5984720	5988960	So please don't get excited for a strapped in big long stream or anything like that. Um
5989840	5994560	I think I will happily watch what the other endings look like. Um
5995680	5998720	Let's take a little water sipping tin. Um, if you are
5999360	6001840	Remaining seated, please do wiggle
6002640	6004640	Move your foot up and down
6004720	6010400	And if you feel your calf muscles flex, then that's good because that is helping the circulation in your legs
6010800	6012800	Just do a few of those and then you're good to go
6013520	6019680	See you later. Bye. Bye. Thanks for hanging. I appreciate it. Uh she be cotton bum 30 minutes
6020080	6024480	She be cotton bum 30 minutes. I will redirect into her though. So don't worry about 30 minutes

6034800	6041520	Wow, oh, I just realized I can't hear any game sound at all right now. Is it because did I tab out?
6045360	6050560	No, I guess it's the end of the day. So to symbolize it's the end of the day the music stops. I was like, where is it?
6052240	6055360	Uh, you know some things may be cliche but they're cliche for a reason like this
6055360	6058400	Welcome home darling. Would you like to have dinner first or a bath or me?
6060400	6063360	Uh, wait, is this because affection is so high?
6068080	6070080	I think so
6072000	6079280	The music is different as well and she's animated different. Okay. I like I like this kind of detail like these subtle things
6082400	6085600	Oh, wow, I'm like appreciating this game

6249200	6258320	Good stream, but that's all it was just good. Um, that's a backhanded comment. So we will remove it because that's not very pleasant
6263120	6267280	Don't you be nervous? Does this thing have scenes? Does this game have scenes that I need to be nervous about?
6270880	6272880	Does this game have scenes that need to be nervous about

6653760	6655760	But don't go too deep
6656400	6658400	No
6659920	6662800	Right, we'll do thank you for 100k because that is
6663440	6669360	Very special milestone to celebrate and it's fantastic. Just got a look around the ideals

6679920	6681920	I
6684800	6686800	Need to play that Russian song
6703920	6706880	Don't politicians usually have high stress and high mental darkness
6707680	6710960	I thought she said she wanted to become like some sort of
6713920	6715520	Uh
6715520	6717120	What socrates
6717120	6722480	I feel like a philosopher to rebuild a new world. I thought that's the kind of route that that angle took
6722480	6725840	That's what I'm trying to get. Well, that's what I think anyway. I don't I don't actually know
6726400	6728880	Because I was kind of like, oh, let's be anti Margaret Thatcher
6730240	6733200	and like public in like the resources
6733760	6735120	Of the
6735120	6738240	Nation need to be in the hands of the public and all that kind of thing

6774400	6779360	I like how she's uh, that's it's so gross down here. You should go back to heaven
6785600	6790560	The internet is oversaturated with users and content that it's hard to tell what to believe in
6791600	6798560	Yes, you should do more conspiracies whenever you whenever you feel lost. I want you to know that you can believe in me
6799840	6801840	All right

6885040	6887040	Oh, is this simple?
6887440	6889040	Uh
6889040	6891040	Obviously
6891200	6894320	I know what it feels like to have nothing and no one
6895280	6897280	La la
6897840	6902320	I skipped school a lot, so I didn't have any friends. Hold on. I don't like when she gets a bit real
6902640	6904960	Only the people online cared about what I had to
6904960	6909280	Fuck it up. I used to sit on xbox and skip school because uh, yeah, I had to have a rough time
6909600	6912240	Let's just get out of that. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute
6912560	6916720	Honestly, I feel like a lot of VTubers probably had a rough time socializing and like that's how
6917280	6920640	They've got the internet culture like be a VTuber in the first place
6921520	6923120	Or is she idle?
6923120	6925280	She's not VTubers. She she's just idle
6927440	6929600	I didn't need no angels had to go to school too
6931200	6936000	Valhalla is a great experience. How many ever big game we game endurance game
6937520	6939520	She's VTuber coded. I was gonna say
6944320	6949920	Try and stay humble and try and stay humble. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Uh, right can't relate to that part of it
6949920	6954880	Anyway, uh, I also got my son out for being socially awkward. You could have messed up in the end
6955600	6957600	Social awkward, yeah
6959360	6964960	Did I ever tell you uh at my job? I actually didn't know it was polite to say good morning to people
6965040	6968800	Like that's how so socially inept I was like I had to learn to say good morning
6968800	6972800	Which is why I like saying good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon to you guys because like I'd like to
6973360	6978480	Think that hopefully like you do get to learn things with me like overtime as long as you have faith in me
6978480	6980480	I will find you within the darkness
6980960	6982160	uh
6982160	6985440	Yeah, like I literally didn't know I was like you say good morning to your cool workers
6985440	6990400	Like a dumbass and I didn't know that that was like socializing and really common
6992560	6996160	Guess that makes you an archangel now, haha. Oh, that's strange
6998080	7000080	Or is it just to signify?
7000480	7002480	Remember you're never alone
7002480	7006400	Bless we are joining the call the bless call bless call bless call
7009440	7015200	K angel having 20 concurrent 100k falls creepy part of the game, which is oh unbelievable unrealistic
7016400	7020800	I can't promise to save everyone because that would be a lie, but if there's just one person to be saved by my person
7020800	7022800	can I would say it's worth
7022960	7024960	Oh, she got fan art
7025200	7028640	Oh, she's greeting. No, didn't cry we in
7029840	7032080	Didn't you need to cry? Why don't you draw a cry in?
7033760	7035920	Only time you're late to draw me crying is because
7036800	7038160	uh
7038160	7041280	I'm just so happy with that act we did previously
7042960	7049040	If my still if my smile can grant soul salvation, then I will keep smiling for all the viewers on the
7050480	7054320	Are we changing her personality as well to become a god?
7060480	7066480	I can't uh play a game do q&a raid a gigantic turtle around shinjuku
7067200	7070800	No, I want her to do the conspiracy theory
7073040	7075040	Uh
7075680	7080400	None of these are conspiracy theory for later. Yeah, okay, okay
7082960	7084960	I hate this wait did her stress go up there?
7091600	7095120	Her affection's still too high for us she's like doing this weird thing
7097440	7101040	How do I find do I find the idea here?
7103680	7106960	I put your stress up her affection down and mental
7108400	7114960	But maybe it'll give us the freaking I want the the freaking politician
7118640	7120640	Oh
7120640	7122640	I
7123040	7127120	Just found out an author that I've like ever since I was kid watches was strange like a dream come true
7127200	7130640	It's mostly these make me so glad but she mean I'm happy that one of my favorite was the most
7130720	7134080	When I replied he was like do you want a video called the disappointment a fellow that
7135200	7138960	I thought this is where I'll start for the mental who says that anymore, but conspiracy
7139760	7141760	conspiracy, please
7141840	7143840	Oh my god, what did you think?
7144560	7148240	You ever get curious about what crazy things people have done online in the past
7148240	7150400	I reckon I could turn my past crunch into content or something
7151440	7153440	That's like watching your debut stream
7153440	7157440	Like definitely vTubers watching their debut stream for the first time like over again
7157520	7160960	Like since after a while has passed like I do agree like that's good content
7161440	7165360	Uh, I wouldn't mind showing our mock streams if I wouldn't show the girls mock streams
7165360	7171440	But my mock stream I actually did better in my second mock stream attempt than I did in my debut
7172240	7174960	Um, and that's fact. I'm happy to show it earlier time
7175360	7178800	It's a good idea, but uh to be honest, I just don't really want to do it
7178800	7182800	Oh, I just make sure think and it makes people want to die, but the suffering is what makes it interesting
7182800	7185440	So I guess I got uh being a streamer so hard
7186080	7188080	girl
7189360	7191360	Being a streamer
7191360	7193360	I'm not putting you in any way
7195360	7198640	But then again, maybe the stars have aligned for someone like me like I know it's not
7198720	7202880	Can we not stream today day off day off day off? I need to boost off some steam. Sure
7205040	7212400	Uh, right if you're genuinely not wanting a day off, that's fine with me. Um, I'm gonna drug you up and see if that
7216080	7218080	Oh, she's gonna get so messed up
