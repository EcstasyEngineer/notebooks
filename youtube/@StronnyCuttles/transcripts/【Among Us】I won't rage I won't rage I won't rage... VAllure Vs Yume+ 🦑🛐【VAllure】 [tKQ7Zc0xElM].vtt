WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
Oh my gosh.

00:02.800 --> 00:03.960
Hello?

00:03.960 --> 00:08.360
I think, I think we, what happened?

00:08.360 --> 00:09.200
I want it.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.240
Can everyone hear my girls?

00:12.240 --> 00:13.800
Scotland forever.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.280
Oh my gosh.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.440
Hi girls, Mina-san.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.280
Hi.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.760
Hi.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.440
Mina-san, ganky disco.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.240
Ganky disco.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.560
Oh, we're starting already?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.000
Oh my God, that was so fast.

00:27.000 --> 00:27.960
That was so fast.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.280
Wait, what?

00:29.280 --> 00:30.800
My body's not ready.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.800
The lobby's going to close.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.880
Are we all here?

00:34.880 --> 00:35.880
We're here.

00:35.880 --> 00:36.880
Close.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.880
Close.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.640
We should do introductions.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.120
We should do introductions when we get in the room.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.600
We can die.

00:44.600 --> 00:45.600
We can die?

00:45.600 --> 00:46.080
OK.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.480
Let's die together.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.720
I'm very anxious.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.720
Wow.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.400
Oh my gosh, I'm imposter.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.200
That's not how this game works.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.680
Oh my God.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.400
I just thought you guys would like to know.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.200
Let's do our introductions around this round table.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
OK, OK.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Great, cool.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.480
The round table.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.160
I'm ready.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.000
Each girl, her spotlight should come up here.

01:11.000 --> 01:11.520
OK, OK.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.800
You may plus first.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.600
OK, you may plus.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.000
You may plus go.

01:16.000 --> 01:16.800
I said no.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.440
The other first.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.120
Hi, my name's the most sister, Saki.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.240
And I like strawberries.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.480
Nice to meet you all.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.640
You have a cherry on your head.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.640
Yay.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.880
Shut up, don't talk to me.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.880
Oh, oh.

01:29.880 --> 01:33.880
You could do like that something.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.880
I guess I'm next.

01:35.880 --> 01:36.360
Yeah.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.760
Hello, I'm Rhea Nevermore, and I am the goat girl

01:39.760 --> 01:42.000
of You May Plus First Generation Remedy.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Yay.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Yay.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Wow.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
You got that.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Wow.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
You're the girl.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Wait, I can't hear them.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Rain, go.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
You hear them now?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, shoot, sorry.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
I had you guys off on my desktop.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Sorry, hold on.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm so dumb.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Damn.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I can't hear them.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
We can smell it.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Okay, okay.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Hi me.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Hi me.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
I can hear myself.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Who's echoing?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Turn off the damn echo.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh my God.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh my God, that's so bad.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Hold on, don't laugh.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yeah.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Like, go.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Scuff scuff.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Scuff scuff.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Scuff scuff.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Scuff scuff.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Scuff scuff.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh my God.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
The voices.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Scuff scuff.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Scuff scuff.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Scuff scuff.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Scuff scuff.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
You're even actually just telling me.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Just get it, just get it, just get it.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Just get it, just get it.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Can you please fix it?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Like that's just crazy.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh wait, that was my laugh.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Can you still hear it?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Or is it gone?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I can hear it, yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
No, it sounds fine, sorry.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It's good, you're fine.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Girl, how loud do you have your head set?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Me?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Yes, yes.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Sorry.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Wait, I fixed it, I fixed it, I fixed it.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I did.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Oh my God, I had it turned down.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Oh my God.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
Welcome to the Via Lour and Yuma Plus Collab

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
where we are scuffed even through the beginning,

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
even though we met an hour before

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and set this all up.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It was more than an hour.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
It's giving poopy.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Speaking of poopy, let me go.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Alright poopy, take it away.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Take it away, take it away.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Hi me, I am Yuma Plus Special Generation Remedy.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm a virtual playing doctor, nice to meet you.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, nice to meet you.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Hi.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Why do I feel like I'm an alcohol synonymous?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Here we go again.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I'm rain and I'm the problem.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Oh, okay.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Okay.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But like seriously, who are you?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Now for Via Lour.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Hey, I'm Sterani, I'm Scottish.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
You can't mix my voice up with anyone in this lobby

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
and I will not tolerate otherwise, thank you.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, Sterani.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Yay.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Yay.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Okay, I'll go.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Hello, my name is Mercy MoDeece from Via Lour,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Yay, nice to meet you.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
That's it.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm a Lour Delay

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
from gen one in gold.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I'll be a lour.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Nice to meet you, mommy.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yay.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
What's up?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I'm Sheezy Cottonbum, but you can call me

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
anytime.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yay.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
That was lit.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
That was lit.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Okay.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Okay, now that introductions are done.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Wait, is introductions done?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah, can we kill each other now?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah, get out.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Bye.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Screw you guys.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
I'm off to do the freaking alien thing.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
No, I'm not.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Are you upset?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Did you hear?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Oh my god, she's good.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I need to do

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
the garbage shoot.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Hold on.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Are you guys okay?

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
You know, it's yourself, man.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
I need the garbage.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Do you want to go do the

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
cars with me?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Three, two, one,

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
go!

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Who's dead?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Can you hear them now?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
It was Amy.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It was Amy.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh my gosh.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Amy's at the garbage shoot.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Amy's at the garbage shoot.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I literally just saw her.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I just came from communication.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And Amy is

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
standing over the body of rain.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Holy crap.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Holy crap.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
No, don't even fucking lie.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I'm sorry, but you're into...

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
You didn't. Is that the best shot?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Sorry, if that's the best you've got.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
That's the best you've got.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I walked in on it.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
It's literally

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Amy.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
It's the Sonic Heroes.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Fucking Shadow Roleplayer.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah, okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
The only guilty thing I have

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
to admit is that I like Shadow,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
but I didn't. I didn't do this.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I promise.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Can Strony set you up?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Yeah, absolutely.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Set you up? Are you fucking having a laugh?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Amy, are you joking?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
I was literally at the gas canister

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
watching you as you got pulled over

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
and then fucking sniped

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
rain in half.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
It's like left behind.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm sorry, but that was a cure...

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Open up my stream.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Open up my stream right now.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I'm not being gas-lipped

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
by a Sonic...

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
a freaking Shadow the Hedgehog streamer

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
right now.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I am not being gas-lipped

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
by a Sonic the Hedgehog

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
stand.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You're getting done.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
I will say that I did see

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Amy stand over the body.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Amy immediately just being like

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
fuck you now, that's not fair.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I didn't do this.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I'm sorry, but you seem

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
suspicious.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Right now, believe me, my baby girl,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I would never, I would never

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
have to fly.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
If it's not Amy, I'm voting

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
for Strony next round.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Wait, why am I getting in trouble?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Obviously, it's going to say imposter.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
You're so passionate.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
You're actually welcome for doing half of the work.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I'll go find the other imposter while you're at it.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I'll do it. I'll try my best.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Damn, Strony, I fucking love you.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Pigeonino?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I've heard the tune, but you don't give a damn.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
See you in death, baby girl.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Wait, what?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Wait, you didn't do it!

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You didn't do it!

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Wait, she didn't do it!

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Mother.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Mother.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Wait, wait, Mercy,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Mercy said she saw it.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Mercy reported.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I walked in.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I walked in.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
I don't know about this.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
What?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
What? I just walked in.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I'm going to go do my shit.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
If somebody kills me, it was Strony.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Wait, I'm not fucking doing it.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Mercy!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Mercy, no!

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Guys, guys, I'm having a little issue.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
You're cheating nasty whore.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I didn't see anything.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Hold on.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Can you guys hear me?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah, can you use her?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
I feel so betrayed, man.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Where are you?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
My atoll.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We're so hurt by this development.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I didn't see anything.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
In my defense, Amy, what kind of defense is I didn't do it?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You had no alibi.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Yeah.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
The candlestick was in the lounge.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
The billiard room had the freaking pool queue.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And it was like, what was that alibi?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I didn't do it.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Oh, we got a play pro punt on D mode.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Clue.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Clue reference.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
That was horrible. I hated every second of that.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I love Shadow the Hedgehog.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Literally, I was like, I'm being accused

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
by a shadow the Hedgehog lover.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I don't know.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I mean, we can't let Sonic the Hedgehog

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
go down without fight.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It's not Sonic, it's Shadow!

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh my god, please, get away!

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Whatever the hell his name is, whatever the hell his name is.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
They both begin with.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Oh, thank god.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Hopefully, this time, I'll actually be imposter.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I'm coming for you, Johnny.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
If you're fucking coming for me, I'm coming up.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
You, goodbye.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh, man.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I'll be a good little girl.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I'll do my test.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Okay, let's try it now.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Wait, where's the map?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Oh, where the fuck is the map?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I need to fix the wiring.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Why are they not highlighting it?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I need to do the asteroid.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Hey, Johnny.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
You're pretty funny last round.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Ask the gun to move in that gaslight.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Right, we're playing gal.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Wait, why is the game sound so quiet?

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
Guys, I'm going to have to turn up the game sound, unfortunately.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Because that should not be making such a tiny little noise.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It's fine, it's fine.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Unlock manifolds.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
A reactor, electrical, divert power to security.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Oh god, what is that?

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Divert power?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Is he divert power?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Oh my god, I love the map.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
The map, the map, the map.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Right, we're going to admin.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
What do I report?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Oh, yes.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
What the hell?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
What the hell?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I was doing it.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
I was doing it.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
It shadowed the hedgehog.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Let me talk.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Okay, found the body.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Let the rabbit speak.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
So I was doing electrical.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
It was coming from electrical.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Actually, I don't know where the map works.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Hold on, let me look at the map.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
You can open up the map.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
I walked up near and in between reactor and security.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
If that were the body.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
I am going to vouch for Rhea in pink.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Because she was near me all the way in navigation.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I saw her go in the opposite direction.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So I think Rhea is fine.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah, yeah, he coughed at me.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
So Strony, Rhea and Mercy are vouching for one another.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Shebi is claiming she saw it.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
So Azura, Mamosa and Rain, you all look in Suss's book.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
What do you guys have to say for yourselves?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I have to say something.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I was in...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
It was not me.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Because I saw...

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
How do we know?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
How do we know it wasn't you?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Because I was with Strony.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Then I went to security and I saw what happened.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I didn't see who killed.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Well, it was in between security.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Yeah, but I...

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
It was in between security and Reactor.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
No, I did see Rain and Admin.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
So Azura and Mamosa are now the most likely suspects.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Unless Shebi, you're playing mind game.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
So Azura, Mamosa and Shebi are all Suss now.

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
Unless Ventilation was taken in Electrical.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Which, unfortunately, I don't know.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I don't believe a word you say, Azura.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Well, I'm innocent.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
I was sitting at the table.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
I was sitting at the table because I'm having audio issues.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I can balance.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I can balance.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Okay.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I don't know who to vote for then.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I'm gonna vote for Mamosa.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Sorry, Mamosa, but you're the most likely target at the moment.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Okay.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Wait, who was the person that said they walked to security?

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I'm gonna skip because I don't know who to vote for.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
It was me.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Azura and Mamosa have abstained from voting.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
How fucking curious.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm just wondering.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.000
What do you guys do?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
What do I do to you?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Right, let's find out.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Mamosa was an imposter.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Azura is the most fucking likely.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I'm keeping an eye on her.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It's impossible.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
But they're no fucking getting me in these mind games.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I know how these games work.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I'm fucking energetic.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
What happens is the lights are off and they don't work.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Wait.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Whoa.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
One, two, three, four.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Electrical.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
More like, electricate my music.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Mommy's been so aggressive.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I think it's the lights.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Okay, look. Thank you.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Unless it's Mercy, I bet.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
What?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Why?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's not me.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
It's not me.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It's not me.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
It's not me.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
She's getting nervous.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
She's getting nervous.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
It's not working.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
I think it's rain.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, it's rain.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
It's not rain.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
So it's both.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Right.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
We do kind of need to breathe oxygen.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Not going to lie.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
We need a cheeky bit of oxygen.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Very fucking curious.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
It wasn't.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Wait a moment.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Who was attacking you?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
It's fucking Mercy.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Oh my god, guys.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Mercy walked by me and disappeared into the nether.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
I do believe it might be her.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
No, I was walking too.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
What was the area on the left?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I was right next to you when you

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I was alone

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
with Rain and Rea

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
and Strawny.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I was with

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Rain. I think it was Rain.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah, it was Rain.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
It's Mercy.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
No, it's not.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
It's freaking you.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
No, it's not. I can't believe you would do such a thing to me.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Oh, is there, I'm sorry.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Oh, okay.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It would make sense

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
why Mercy would vote.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Oh.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Oh!

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Yay!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, let's go!

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh, fantastic.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Game play, fucking flow.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I actually like to approve it

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
because the pressure of being a poster is hard.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I'm sorry.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I probably could have killed.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Mercy walked right past me

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
and I'm surprised you didn't kill me then

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
because I was just talking to myself

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
with a weirdo.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I just wanted to.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
I wanted to let you all live.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I'm sorry.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Look at me being so kind as an imposter,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
letting you live.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
You're not kind.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I'm not accepted.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm red, not blue, goddamn.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Jesus.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm lying. I forgive you.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I can never be mad.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
All right.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Do my task and shake my hand.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Hi, I'm with garbage shooters.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Garbage shooters.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm sorry about last time.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Please don't kill me.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
We're doing the garbage shoot boys.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Taking out the garbage.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I don't know what any of this stuff is.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I'm going to be honest.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I'm scared.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
This is closed. I'm so scared.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh, there you go.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Why are you...

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You're fine.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
You're fine.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
I'm traumatized.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Hold on a minute.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Amy is in

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
fucking electrical

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
and who does something upon?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Who are we? Ria's dead body again.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh, no.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
She's a victim.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I literally opened the door

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
because the door just got closed in my face.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Me and...

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm fucking on the outside.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And then Amy comes out

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
and then I go in to the back of the vent section

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
and Ria's sitting dead with her retort.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
No, listen.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Amy,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
do you have to say for yourself?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Did you tell me to kill myself?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
No, what do you have to say for yourself?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Not that.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I mean, if you want to...

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I can't stop you.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I was doing electricals.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Yes, you were because that's where you killed her.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
She just admitted.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
She just admitted.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
She was...

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Strony, I think you're making money.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Strony, when you get like this...

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Strony, when you get like this...

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
No, because I know...

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Wait, no.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
When Strony came and opened the door,

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I screamed because you scared me.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
No, listen to...

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Listen to Amy.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
She literally goes.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
She literally goes.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I was in electrical.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It's like breaking her microphone.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
She literally goes.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
She literally goes.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I was in electrical.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
I tell you, I find the dead body of Rhea in electrical

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
and you go, oh, it's Strony.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm abstaining.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
All right, then.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
All right, then.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
She goes, I'm in electrical.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I like how nobody's questioning us.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I know it's Amy.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Wait, wait.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I don't know.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
If it's Amy, it also might be Mamosa

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
because Mamosa was cornering me

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
and she saw them walking together.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I was chilling with you.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
No, I have not seen Azura.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Where's her body?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Probably by the table again.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Probably by the table.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
She got the table.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I saw Azura talking.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I saw Azura talking.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I saw Azura talking.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
It was rain.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Excuse me, what was that, Marcy?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Wait, who?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Right, go do tasks if you want to win

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
or don't do tasks if you want to freaking die.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Oh, my God, Azura's we bit.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I'm voting for Marcy.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
What for me?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Na na no.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
No, Marcy's voting for me.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
So when you see me floating in space

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and I can't even play the game.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
It's Marcy.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.600
When it goes, oh, when

21:07.600 --> 21:10.000
when床y is in Poster,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
vote Marcy because she's gonna vote for me

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
last time it was Susie Baka.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
No.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Wait, no, Marcy always

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
votes for the person that accuses her

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
when she's a posture

21:23.360 --> 21:27.920
If you want to lose this crew mate have none, but I'm here at win and you guys

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
We know it's not she be

21:46.400 --> 21:48.920
Right when I float away in space and it says

21:48.920 --> 21:54.880
Ronnie was a wee crew mate everyone turned to merci and vote for her. Thank you very much. I rest my frickin case

21:56.320 --> 21:58.320
I'm no having it

22:19.920 --> 22:21.920
I

22:30.200 --> 22:36.160
Because mercy will accuse someone and vote for somebody who is who is the imposter and accusing her

22:37.160 --> 22:40.120
Back and then scrawny gets so defensive

22:41.920 --> 22:43.920
Have a midget as a pet

22:48.920 --> 22:50.920
Oh

23:18.920 --> 23:23.920
I can't wait to murder

23:27.720 --> 23:29.720
My god, why am I imposter again?

23:36.440 --> 23:38.440

24:00.720 --> 24:05.800
I'm glad we gonna for myself as well when my attitude is absolutely stinking in this game. I have to admit

24:05.800 --> 24:07.800
I'm taking nothing but the pain

24:07.960 --> 24:12.520
They legit are must be like so sick and screaming so you know what we're gonna do next then

24:13.480 --> 24:17.480
We're gonna know and we're gonna be calm and we're gonna laugh

24:25.200 --> 24:29.800
Okay, they're tickling each other behind over here they're tickling each other behind the bin

24:42.520 --> 24:44.520
I

24:47.800 --> 24:52.880
Sorry, I'm getting chased by mercy halfway across the canteen. I'm just here for a scoop of food

24:52.880 --> 24:56.160
I'm not I'm not gonna lie. I'm just here for a wee bit of food. You just leave me alone

24:56.160 --> 25:00.040
I actually you know what if you're imposter you should come for me first cuz I'm gonna figure out who the

25:00.920 --> 25:04.480
Right who's dead as there came from here. So there's a dead body in here. It's a zero

25:05.040 --> 25:07.040
Right, but there's no dead body

25:07.600 --> 25:09.600
So we can't approve we can't actually prove

25:13.400 --> 25:20.760
Right check in Azura did come from here. We're actually gonna be a cheeky we that and pop on cameras, right? Okay. Okay, we're motion

25:21.280 --> 25:25.840
Right Amy and Azura together right, but my motion here. Oh, everyone's fucking cleaned up

25:27.200 --> 25:31.800
Right Azura and Amy can get a kill on each other right now if they're feeling confident enough

25:31.800 --> 25:38.440
They're having a wee giggle. They're having a wee laugh. Azura is holding back not really doing any tasks. I don't like what I'm seeing

25:39.440 --> 25:42.760
We are going to do the last oh, sorry, I can count numbers one, two

25:44.920 --> 25:46.920
Six of them eight nine ten

25:47.520 --> 25:53.440
Okay, lovely. We're gonna go back on cameras because these imposters think they're gonna get the better of me absolutely fucking

25:53.920 --> 25:56.560
Right, we see it Azura and Amy together again

25:57.200 --> 26:00.440
Interesting interesting they two seem to be hugging one another

26:01.360 --> 26:06.080
Mamosa has come out come out rails now coming my way I repeat rea is now coming my way

26:06.080 --> 26:09.520

26:10.680 --> 26:18.360
What I'm fucking are you going for me? Be honest. I think I think I think I think you're going a little skit

26:19.240 --> 26:23.960
I'm actually gonna get done by real. She's so cute. She's gonna be done. I'm gonna say thank you by the end of it

26:25.840 --> 26:27.840

Hold on right and I'm Amy again are on their own

26:33.200 --> 26:35.360

26:41.280 --> 26:48.640

26:49.640 --> 26:51.640
She be out of med bay

26:51.760 --> 26:58.080
Incredibly quickly timing on she be coming out of med bay almost as if uninterested in any test meriskay is fucking over me

26:58.080 --> 27:00.080
I'm getting nervous

27:02.440 --> 27:04.440
Me

27:13.400 --> 27:17.800
Only rain I found rain dead in the back of electrical nobody was nearby

27:19.640 --> 27:24.640
But I have a feeling it might be rea and Azura because they like to sit what with each other

27:24.640 --> 27:26.640
They like a whole pants cuz they're go

27:30.120 --> 27:32.600
And rea together no, I saw yeah

27:37.560 --> 27:40.880
And then I was with Azura and then she became a mocked in on us

27:42.440 --> 27:45.520
Well, that doesn't mean they couldn't have vented from electrical to

27:46.360 --> 27:48.040
Mercy are very

27:48.040 --> 27:53.440
Lately I've had to do the time in order to do electrical unless Mercy vented from below

27:53.440 --> 27:59.240
But I actually wait did I see you come on cameras from I don't think that would make any sense. I think it's Azura

27:59.240 --> 28:01.240
I'm sorry

28:18.040 --> 28:20.040
I'm going

28:48.800 --> 28:54.240

Yeah, cuz I've already done on my task. They don't take that long. I mean I saw my tasks, but I'm really scared

29:02.320 --> 29:06.040
No, I don't do that. I'll stay on count. Oh, Mary's is gonna fucking wallop me

29:07.400 --> 29:10.400

29:11.760 --> 29:15.040
She was the imposter and so I was like bye

29:19.040 --> 29:21.040
Amy's actually going to save

29:22.800 --> 29:29.360
Mamosa is following Amy so whatever happens in that room Mamosa and Amy are confirmed to be together. Yeah, piss off

Did you run so slowly

30:18.040 --> 30:20.040
You know

30:26.080 --> 30:28.360
Okay, well, I guess we'll see I'll guess we'll see

30:30.160 --> 30:32.760
Mosa if it's if it's not her

30:48.040 --> 30:50.040
The person that's trying to kill you

30:53.360 --> 30:55.360
Maybe you guys are both

30:55.960 --> 30:58.400
Posters, I don't trust either one of you now

30:59.120 --> 31:01.120
Like a sassy vodka social beat

31:02.440 --> 31:04.440
Only people I trust here

31:07.480 --> 31:09.480

35:06.080 --> 35:10.800
That was such a quick fucking round like bro, but I didn't even have time to gather any information

35:15.000 --> 35:21.760
We downloaded this like proximity chat thing so we can like only hear each other when we get close

35:29.240 --> 35:33.600
Obviously it means we can like scream at each other when we're playing the game. It's just really fun

35:34.560 --> 35:39.440
Or I think it's funny. I thought it was cute

35:40.280 --> 35:44.560
Maybe yeah, I'm talking about proximity chat to the reeflings

35:52.880 --> 35:55.240
Yeah, I was gonna say the hover and around I didn't really

Yes, I freaking know I I me had every chance to kill me. We were alone so many times

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
I watched her do the oxygen

39:02.200 --> 39:04.200
Maybe

39:06.280 --> 39:10.680
Rain cannot lie. I think she's grooming you. I think it's a Zura and rain

39:11.400 --> 39:13.400

39:26.280 --> 39:30.440
A rain and no, it's not I don't think it's I think it's actually I me

39:31.640 --> 39:35.320

So we need

40:03.000 --> 40:05.880
Or we can hit the table oxygen depleted

40:07.080 --> 40:09.080
It's a Zura. It's a Zura

40:11.400 --> 40:13.400
One of them and let them know

40:15.000 --> 40:20.440
We just gotta kill one of them

40:35.400 --> 40:37.400
About her off

I really cannot hear. Oh, well, you don't need audio to play this game. Are you're sitting? Of course not

43:41.320 --> 43:43.320
Someone echoing

43:43.560 --> 43:45.560

43:45.560 --> 43:49.720
I would need it. One's game is echoing. Oh, what's my joke? What's my ta- oh, na na

43:57.240 --> 44:01.160
Oh, no, I can't see you guys. It's pretty good

44:05.400 --> 44:07.400
Do you remember

44:13.640 --> 44:15.640
I'm playing mid-summer

44:17.160 --> 44:20.040
I shouldn't do that. It's fine. What's this?

44:21.560 --> 44:23.560
Go go

44:27.080 --> 44:33.400
Right, I need to do cameras next so I can start freeing people

44:36.120 --> 44:39.800
Right, I'm on cameras. What's going on? We've got rea

44:41.960 --> 44:47.560
Hold on. There's an emergency. I'm helping with the emergency

44:48.680 --> 44:50.680
Wait, am I being dumb?

44:51.560 --> 44:54.920
Can I not interact with this? Wait, that's the pretend to interact with this?

44:55.880 --> 45:02.040
Am I being dumb? Where's the oxygen freaking help help? Where's the oxygen help?

45:03.720 --> 45:07.800
Help any oxygen breathers. Hello, how do I interact with the oxygen?

45:07.800 --> 45:09.800
No

45:21.720 --> 45:26.600
Guys, listen, she was standing right there. I walk into the card room or whatever then I am used dead body

45:26.600 --> 45:29.240
And then mercy then reports. Why are we just standing?

45:30.520 --> 45:36.040
Because I was doing I was doing the um, I was doing the downloads and I wouldn't let me go

45:36.840 --> 45:42.920
Wait, you did a freaking nervous. She saw me. You did a task before

45:45.480 --> 45:47.480
It's a self report. Wait, oh my god

45:50.440 --> 45:56.760
How do you not notice the body you did a task before reporting a body on purpose. Yes or no, that's us

45:57.240 --> 45:58.920
I think it's mercy

45:58.920 --> 46:02.120
It's the download thing. Well, you can vote for me if you want, but it's gonna say

46:03.080 --> 46:07.160
And then I'm gonna tell you told you so I'm voting for you. I'm sorry. Yeah

46:09.480 --> 46:11.480
If you vote for me if you want that sounds very

46:12.840 --> 46:14.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

46:17.000 --> 46:20.120
This is off topic when the oxygen thing comes on what do you

46:20.760 --> 46:24.280
Did I look at the wrong part of the map for the oxygen because I was trying to turn it back on

46:25.720 --> 46:28.200
Wait, why is there a crime just on the right side of the map?

46:29.160 --> 46:32.120
Hey, mercy, if it's not you, I'm sorry. I'm real sorry

46:33.880 --> 46:35.880
Wait, why are you going for me?

46:36.440 --> 46:39.880
Why should I randomly get a vote because I'm doing oxygen

46:44.280 --> 46:46.280
Why did I get a friend of both?

46:49.000 --> 46:51.640
I don't know why any of you ever trust stroney, I don't

46:58.600 --> 47:00.600
I was trying to do the oxygen

47:03.480 --> 47:06.680
No, I'm so serious. I'm so serious when I say this

47:08.200 --> 47:10.200
I was trying to do the oxygen

47:11.000 --> 47:14.840
I was doing I was trying to do the oxygen. I said I'm perfect

47:15.480 --> 47:20.040
Because then I would have an alibi to say that I'm top left when the bodies were done

47:24.120 --> 47:26.120
Right before

47:26.840 --> 47:28.840
I will choose who the imposter is

47:30.360 --> 47:36.360
Because I honestly didn't I was like looking at the map and it was flashing. I'm like, where's the f I'm not supposed to go

47:37.080 --> 47:39.080

48:46.760 --> 48:52.440
It kills all of us. Oh, okay. Uh, where do you put it on right? I'm gonna just trust someone else is dealing with it

50:13.640 --> 50:16.120
I was in wiring in front of azure

50:16.840 --> 50:22.920
She is sus though. She was laughing easily chasing me down a hallway. I ran into the open arms of mimosa

50:23.880 --> 50:25.880
It was really fun

50:26.040 --> 50:28.040
Rain, who were you with?

Okay, because I was also at the zero at one point. Azura, who are you accusing?

50:42.920 --> 50:47.240
I don't remember the truth. I didn't know what I didn't accuse you. No, I have no clue what's going on

50:48.840 --> 50:51.960
Right, right, right. Okay. Azura took a

50:53.240 --> 51:01.080
Azura took a hot second to do any type of task. She followed me from cafeteria down to storage and imparted with

51:01.960 --> 51:03.960
When you talk, I don't believe you

51:06.040 --> 51:09.480
That's also true and that's very on par for you. I won't say

51:21.640 --> 51:25.480
I didn't see anybody nearby, but the closest was ran into the lives anymore

51:26.600 --> 51:29.480
Okay, all I know is they were by oh two

Wait, who this time she's not talking that much. I literally shove up yours. I'm a little imposter. Why is

51:49.160 --> 51:51.160
She's being sassy

51:52.840 --> 51:55.320
How about you abstain from existing my only

51:55.880 --> 51:57.480
My only

51:57.480 --> 52:02.280
In my only inclination is memos. Is that your cat's food dish? Yes

52:04.200 --> 52:10.840

I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how to believe

52:28.680 --> 52:30.680
I don't know how to believe you believe me

52:32.920 --> 52:37.400
Because you know, you know when I when I'm not running and Raven that's when you know because when you know you

I'm gonna hang out with strongy. Yes. I'm I'm checking

You can see cameras when I look at cameras as well, can't you? Yeah. Yeah, we can both look at cameras

53:01.640 --> 53:07.480
All right. I strongy mom. I think we're both good. Okay. I'm happy to say we're good if you're good because you're

53:09.160 --> 53:14.280
That'd be hilarious if you killed me. Azura is literally lingering outside because she's waiting for one of us to be alone

53:15.000 --> 53:16.520
She can kill us

53:16.520 --> 53:19.640
I actually have to do a task bottom right to be honest

53:20.040 --> 53:25.240
All right, I'm gonna go with me and if I die. Oh, no, don't no, no, don't come with me bottom right

53:25.320 --> 53:28.760
I need to do. Okay. Okay. I need to do something in communication. Whoa

53:29.480 --> 53:31.480
It doesn't matter

53:33.240 --> 53:35.240
What oh, Azura it's Azura

53:35.800 --> 53:39.480
Dude, I think it's Azura too. I saw her walking into electrical

Yeah, it's Azura and mercy electrical and found a body. What the fuck

53:44.600 --> 53:49.720
What the fuck? Me and strongy are good. I was hanging out with strongy looking at cameras

53:50.040 --> 53:52.040
Yeah, Azura was lurking around

53:54.120 --> 53:57.480
How are you gonna say it's me? I think I'm trying to find someone to follow

53:58.040 --> 54:02.120
Being creepy. Uh, I'm gonna vote for this mercy because you don't trust that stuff she's looking at me

54:02.280 --> 54:04.600
Mercy, who did you see on the map? Listen to me

54:05.480 --> 54:06.360
What?

54:06.360 --> 54:09.160
Mercy, who were you with or who did you see at any point in the map?

54:11.240 --> 54:13.240
I passed by mimosa

54:14.360 --> 54:16.520
Oh, when you killed her? No, he didn't. No

54:17.640 --> 54:22.760
It's rain. It's rain. It's rain. It's literally rain. I was

Listen, I know

54:27.800 --> 54:30.200
But why where's the reasoning Azura?

54:30.840 --> 54:35.160
I said it. I was literally with you guys in I was literally with you guys in security

54:35.160 --> 54:37.720
I went to the security with you guys and then I went up

54:38.280 --> 54:41.640
I went and did my task and came back down and she said did she accuse me?

54:42.440 --> 54:44.440
She accused me

54:45.400 --> 54:47.240
Oh, I fucking heard that giggle at the end of his

54:47.240 --> 54:49.240
All right. All right. She's so pretty

Run run run run run. We're getting double teamed

55:06.520 --> 55:07.640

55:20.040 --> 55:21.240
Well, well, well, well, well, that's it.

Volt rain. Azura, you have to listen to us. Volt rain. Listen to me. It's rain. Volt rain.

And they didn't care. And they didn't care.

55:35.400 --> 55:38.840
Because her and Mercy almost doubled me in Strani.

Literally.

55:39.340 --> 55:40.800
No, we didn't man.

55:40.800 --> 55:41.740
You guys were going to double me.

55:41.740 --> 55:44.580
You guys were lining yourselves up to stab me in my bauhole.

55:44.580 --> 55:48.180
Yeah, look at Ray do a fucking heal Mary on that vote against Sheebie.

Stay away, stay away from the yandere.

56:03.620 --> 56:06.740
Oh my God, before she can get run away, run away from the circle.

Get that, get that yandere off this ship right now.

56:18.780 --> 56:20.940
She's creeping me out.

56:20.940 --> 56:23.620
You're not even talking, that's how guilty you are.

56:23.620 --> 56:27.860
You're, you're, you're running in a circle, chasing me and Strani.

56:27.860 --> 56:31.420
When I actually have the chance to actually like pay attention.

56:34.020 --> 56:35.820
What is her up to?

56:35.820 --> 56:36.620
What did I have?

56:36.620 --> 56:40.020
Cause I spent the entire game fucking with other shit.

56:40.020 --> 56:42.220
And now I get to finally play.

56:42.220 --> 56:43.020
Yeah.

56:43.020 --> 56:44.220
Yes.

56:44.220 --> 56:46.620
If Azura is in the posture, I'm really going to commit.

56:46.620 --> 56:47.620
I'm smart.

56:47.620 --> 56:49.420
I'm not a postage.

56:49.420 --> 56:50.220
No, she wasn't.

56:50.220 --> 56:51.820
You can tell by the tone of her voice.

56:54.420 --> 56:56.220
Yeah, they weren't going to double us.

56:56.220 --> 56:56.820
Yeah.

56:56.820 --> 56:58.020
They weren't going to double us.

56:58.020 --> 57:00.620
Thank God, Azura, you saved us.

57:01.620 --> 57:03.620
The gamer in six.

57:03.620 --> 57:05.620
Thank you.

57:05.620 --> 57:07.620
Let's say go brothers.

57:07.620 --> 57:08.620
That was easy.

57:08.620 --> 57:10.620
That was good.

57:10.620 --> 57:16.620
We're going to start an MLG group of among us unironically.

57:16.620 --> 57:18.620
Hell no.

57:18.620 --> 57:19.620
Hell no.

57:19.620 --> 57:20.620
We're fine.

57:20.620 --> 57:21.620
Okay.

57:21.620 --> 57:22.620
Okay.

57:22.620 --> 57:23.620
My girls hydrate.

57:23.620 --> 57:24.620
Hydration.

57:24.620 --> 57:25.620
Hydration.

57:25.620 --> 57:27.620
This coffee counts.

57:27.620 --> 57:28.620
Coffee counts.

57:28.620 --> 57:29.620
Just hydrate.

57:29.620 --> 57:31.620
Just hydrate because it's been an hour, roughly.

57:31.620 --> 57:32.620
Thank you.

57:32.620 --> 57:33.620
Thank you.

57:33.620 --> 57:34.620
I'm sorry.

57:34.620 --> 57:36.620
I've been bullying you a little too much this round.

57:36.620 --> 57:37.620
Let's go navigation.

57:41.620 --> 57:42.620
Please don't touch me.

57:42.620 --> 57:43.620
No, I'm the navigation.

57:46.620 --> 57:48.620
You don't play a game of fire truck?

57:50.620 --> 57:52.620
That's an absolutely terrible joke, too.

57:52.620 --> 57:55.620
You don't ever repeat switch tricks, do you think?

57:55.620 --> 57:57.620
It is ill-advised.

57:57.620 --> 57:58.620
I can repeat switch tricks.

58:00.620 --> 58:01.620
Okay.

58:01.620 --> 58:02.620
Nothing in the shadows.

58:02.620 --> 58:03.620
Nothing.

58:03.620 --> 58:04.620
Nothing.

58:04.620 --> 58:05.620
Are we minors?

58:05.620 --> 58:06.620
Well, minors.

58:08.620 --> 58:11.620
She wasn't actually doing a task in the Slurkin Bay as well.

58:11.620 --> 58:12.620
They're killing me again.

58:12.620 --> 58:13.620
Yeah, we are.

58:13.620 --> 58:14.620
Sorry to god.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.620
I'm supposed to get the fuck away from you.

58:16.620 --> 58:17.620
Wait.

58:17.620 --> 58:18.620
We just...

58:18.620 --> 58:19.620
They just treat me.

58:19.620 --> 58:20.620
No one.

58:20.620 --> 58:22.620
All right, it's five so there's at least a fucking witness inside.

58:22.620 --> 58:23.620
I got it.

58:23.620 --> 58:24.620
Using this room.

58:24.620 --> 58:25.620
How do I use it?

58:25.620 --> 58:26.620
No.

58:26.620 --> 58:29.500
Oh my gosh, I got it in one go.

58:29.500 --> 58:36.620

59:29.300 --> 59:34.300
So I need to do my head like this.

59:34.300 --> 59:39.300
Okay, we did it.

59:39.300 --> 59:41.300
Oh, come on.

59:41.300 --> 59:43.300
Who is laughing?

59:43.300 --> 59:44.300
What's going on here?

59:44.300 --> 59:46.300
Azura and Mercer together.

59:46.300 --> 59:49.300
The real follows.

59:49.300 --> 59:51.300
Ah, shit.

59:51.300 --> 59:53.300
She be no follows.

59:53.300 --> 59:55.300
Oh, come on.

59:57.300 --> 59:59.300
Wait, no.

59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.300
She killed me.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.300
No idea.

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.300
She killed me.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.300
The whole show was so close.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.300
She was trying to get me.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.300
She was trying to get me.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.300
She was trying to get me.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:15.300
She was trying to get me.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.300
Earlier, earlier.

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.300
My mother was chasing me.

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:28.300
I did watch, but I don't know, you broke my trust before, I mean, I don't know, I don't know what to say.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:36.300
It's I mean, I was chasing around them, I was chasing her and messing with her and she killed me.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.300
I don't know who, I don't know who it was.

01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:40.300
She beat me up.

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:41.300
I'm going to say it won't stop.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.300
She did beat me up.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.300
She did beat me up.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.300
She did beat me up.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.300
She did beat me up.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.300
She did beat me up.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:51.300
Oh, you guys are so dumb.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.300
You weren't doing any jobs, fool.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:56.300
We were no dumb.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.300
That's crazy.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:02.300
I mean, I mean, I mean, I didn't mean it.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.300
It wasn't me.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.300
What the fuck?

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:05.300
She wasn't doing any jobs.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.300
She was like jumping corners and stuff and not doing anything.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.300
Sorry, anyone thought she looked suss to me?

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.300
I don't know what to do here.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.300
Wait, what?

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.300
What?

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.300
Are we, I was going to say, are we can interact in each other?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.300
Vote it out.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.300
Oh, who got voted out?

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.300
Chibi, what is it?

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.300
I don't trust Ivy again.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300
I didn't.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.300
Okay, well, we'll just vote her off.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.300
She was so adamant.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.300
Yes, she was.

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.300
The same tears as before.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300
I don't want to get my heart broken again.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.300
We shared a kiss.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.300
I trust you, fuck it.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.300
I'll trust you.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.300
No, Missy.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.300
I mean, Blav has been a weird.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.300
I'm in a relationship.

01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.300
I'm in a relationship.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.300
Yes, me too.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.300
I'm going to abstain.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.300
I don't know.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.300
I'm going to do what I must.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.300
I'm doing what I must.

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.300
I'm doing what I must.

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.300
I don't trust you.

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.300
What about all the time?

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.300
I'm going to kill everyone now.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.300
Wait, Tronka's been very quiet.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.300
I don't trust you?

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.300
It may be rare.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.300
Okay.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.300
We only got to be the reacting out?

01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.300
Rhea go.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:37.300
Rhea has been an imposter.

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.300
It has to be.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:48.060
I'm waiting for someone on the other side hold react to normal all right I think

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:54.300
Put that on hmm I actually didn't eat

01:02:54.300 --> 01:03:05.300
I think I just saw message that she just went from I think message is bent I think she just caught the trail under there

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:19.300
Sorry I'm actually sweating and try hard and I can't actually do mercy and she vented and that's how we got to that all about to win though

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:29.300

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.300
I said I found her in Med Bay I finished my task

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:53.300
It's Trony it's Trony it's Trony wait why is it fucking me

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:58.300

Sorry I need to mute the girls so you guys know exactly

01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:03.300
I saw the tail end of mercy coming out of electrical which couldn't have made any sense due to fucking geographical shit

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:10.300
So they're all getting fucking muted right now so I could explain that I caught mercy and that's why I asked is where did you find the body in Med Bay

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:17.300
She had been venting around the map but because Azure is so gun whole

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:23.300
Anyway I still win in that case because I knew who the bad guy was

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.300
Just let him fight it out

01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.300
We've hung out the entire time

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.300
We have a cat fight

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.300
We've hung out the entire time

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.300
It's mercy

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.300
Okay I'm voting Azure

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.300

01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:34.300
No it's mercy

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.300

I can't believe it

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.300
It's always the cute ones

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:00.300
Absolutely not

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:02.300
Azure we're on

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.300
Freya vented and killed me in Med Bay

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:07.300
He's obsessed with you

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.300
I was like oh shit

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.300
You said it was mercy

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.300
You said it was mercy

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.300
You said it was mercy though

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.300
You said it was mercy

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.300
It was mercy

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.300
But you instantly went for me when I hadn't done the single thing

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:25.300
It's because you said it was mercy

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.300
You're dying

01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.300

You're dying for me

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.300
You're dying for me

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.300
So I got mucus in my throat

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.300
You're already killed me

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.300
You're getting double killed when I'm imposter you're welcome

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.300
I should go up here

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.300
To the test driven the fucking thing

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.300
Who do you think she is killing me for?

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.300
Oh it's strawnee it's strawnee

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.300
Everyone suspects it's me

That'd be great

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.300
You guys

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.300

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.300
For once

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.300
I fucking love when

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.300
Like there's four people

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:36.300
When there's two of us together

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.300

You're a hit woman

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.300
Anyways my next goal

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.300
Is to follow someone just for fun

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:52.300
Oh just to wind them up and make them

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.300
Shibbe why do you sound so far away

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:56.300
Yeah it was okay I felt like Shibbe's in my brain

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.300
Oh

01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.300
You're gonna marry me

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.300
I forgot

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.300
She has like an actual place to live

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.300
And doesn't live in her basement like me

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.300
I like how her kitchen is right next to her desk

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.300
That's cool

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.300
I want food right next to me all the time

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.300
Honestly Rhea was too good

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.300
I like believed her

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.300
I believed her

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.300
Rhea you're so freaking innocent

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.300
She's such a good liar

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.300
You're capable of anything

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.300
She doesn't even like change the tone of her voice

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.300
You're just so innocent

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:28.300
You didn't change your tone of voice at all

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.300
When lying

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.300
Oh why is my peeing dancing like that

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.300
You see that I went all the way up to 300

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:35.300
Mane's at 200 by default

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.300
Never trust Rhea

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.300
I can't tell

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:40.300
She's one of the few people I can't tell

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.300
You can tell really good mercy

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.300
You caught on to me

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.300
My mouth is dry

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:48.300
I'm sorry Rain

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.300
I just noticed your voice

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.300
Thank you Shibbe

01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.300
My mouth is dry

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.300
I believed her to the end as well

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:01.300
Get ass I believed Raina to the end

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.300
I can never tell if she's a fanatic

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.300
Is she ever lying or not

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:08.300
I can never tell if she's lying or not

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.300
I can tell because she's real defensive

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:18.300
Every time you don't let someone finish

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.300
It feels like you're being defensive

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:22.300
And not letting the person speak

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.300
So you're deflecting

01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.300
So I assume that you're the

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.300
You gotta let me

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.300
You gotta let me explain

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.300
Because you're lying

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.300
Fight fight fight

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.300
You gotta let me explain why

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.300
And then you have to tell me why I'm wrong

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.300
Honestly if you listen to what I know

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.300
I'm gonna go through it that way

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.300
Because you voted too quickly

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.300
So let me

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.300
Well yeah because you didn't let me speak

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.300
Honestly I wanted to

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.300
I wanted to

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.300
I thought scrawny was suspicious anyways

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.300
It just feels good

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.300
It's super sad

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.300
What am I gonna do?

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.300
Right, scrawny is suspicious

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.300
I see how it is

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.300
That's it, you'll get that

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.300
That's it, I'll be your member

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.300
It's funny

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:06.300
It's suspicious

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:09.300
It's a 40 days, no pain

01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:10.300
It's what they deserve

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:11.300
A 40 days

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.300
What they deserve

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:14.300
40 days, 20 nights

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.300
You make push scrawny

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.300
You're a really good guy

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.300
You're the cold suspension

01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:18.300
We're not gonna lie

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.300
You're really good at gaslighting

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.300
So I'll say one thing

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:23.300
The girls have never seen me

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.300
At any other type of motion

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.300
They're more than happy

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.300
And proud of their work

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.300
So playing among us

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:30.300
When I'm screaming down the make

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.300
Being like, it's fucking da

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.300
Is probably quite a surprise for them

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.300
It is

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.300
I was just like

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.300
Honestly, yeah

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.300
I expected it

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.300
Nice and refreshed, Daniel

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.300
Trouble from school

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.300
I wanna

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.300
I wanna see Azura and Rhea

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.300
Or scrawny and Rhea team up

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:49.300
That's what I wanna see

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:50.300
That'd be funny

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.300
Scrawny and Rhea

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:53.300
I haven't gotten imposter once

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.300
You've not been imposter?

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:56.300
Yeah, guys, let's give Azura a chance

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.300
Okay

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:58.300
Let's give Azura imposter

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.300
The statistics of Azura being imposter

01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.300
Are very high now

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:02.300
Just to keep that in mind

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.300
Yeah

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.300
Probability statistics

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.300
Just for everyone

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.300
Don't do that

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.300
See, look, she's gaslighting

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.300
I'm gonna get killed

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.300
She says things like this

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.300
See, they're funny

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.300
This is how I get killed

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.300
They're all fine to mess with

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:18.300
I'm eating goldfish

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:19.300
I'm eating goldfish

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.300
A snack that smiles best

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:22.300
That's a regular kind of goldfish

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:23.300
She says scrawny

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.300
Because she says the suss is shit ever

01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:26.300
Her names are Rhea

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.300
She's a screw

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:30.300
Oh no, my hair is thick

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.300
Again

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.300
I'm sick of being a crewmate

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.300
I'm gonna be

01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.300
Wait, wait, wait, wait

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:37.300
Who said that?

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.300
Clean the leaves out of the filter

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.300
What are you looking for

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.300
There's nothing here for you

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.300
Alright, I'm talking to my cat

01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:54.300
Nice, Ronnie

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.300
Okay, sorry

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.300
I'm like, are you doing any tests, Shuby?

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.300
Or are you just like pulling me right now?

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.300
No

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:01.300
Oh, take your time

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.300
I'll protect you

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.300
Go someplace

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.300
Wow

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:05.300
Okay, I did it

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.300
Yay

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.300
I'm a shiny safe

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.300
I did swipe card

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.300
We just did the swipe card

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.300
Yeah

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.300
Right, okay

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.300
Electrical, please

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:18.300
Excuse me, my lovely wife

01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.300
I have to go to

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.300
Electrical too

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.300
Okay, okay, be safe in here

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.300
Safety in numbers

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.300
Safety in numbers

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.300
Wait, where's the body?

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.300
Where is the other body?

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:41.300
Oh my god

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.300
Oh my god, holy shit

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.300
What happened?

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:44.300
I was about to report

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.300
Wait, where was everyone?

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.300
I was about to report

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:49.300
Wait, where's my...

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.300
Shuby, Shuby, Shuby

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.300
Where was she found the body?

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.300
Raya was literally with me

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.300
And Strani as well

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:55.300
I saw Strani

01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.300
I passed by those two

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.300
I was in electrical

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:00.300
There was a body there

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:01.300
Wait

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.300
Well

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.300
First of all

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.300
Wait

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.300
Excuse me

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.300
Secondly

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.300
I was shooting asteroids

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.300
And I walked down

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:10.300
And there was a body at oxygen

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.300
And it was Mimosa

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.300
She was probably doing like a little shoot

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.300
Is anyone being a navigation

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.300
Or to our weapons?

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:18.300
Yes or no?

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.300
No

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.300
Yes

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.300
No

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:22.300
I was in cafeteria

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.300
I was about to do electrical

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.300
Wait, who was cafeteria?

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:26.300
I know it's Strani

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.300
I just know it's Strani

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.300
I just know it's Strani

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.300
Bro, you fucking...

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.300
Wait, hold on a minute

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:32.300
Hold on a minute

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.300
I say who's been near weapons O2 navigation

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.300
Because you have reported the body

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.300
And where O2

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.300
And you automatically go to Strani

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.300
Sorry

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.300
I know you love playing these mind games

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.300
Being like, Strani, Strani, Strani

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:45.300
But get to...

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:46.300
No, no, no, no

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:47.300
You're the only one

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.300
It's Strani

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.300
It's fucking she

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.300
I mean, hold on

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:51.300
It's Strani

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.300
No, no, no, no

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.300
Hold on, hold on, hold on

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.300
Wait, hold on

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.300
Notice how I'm nice and calm

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:56.300
And she's freaking out

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.300
And that's all I'm gonna say

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.300
I'm reaching on me when you

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.300
Self-reported the body

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.300
When you're the only person

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:03.300
Who's been witnessing weapons O2 navigation

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.300
Fucking rain

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.300
Clearly because the body was there

01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:07.300
For a lot longer

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:08.300
Yeah, it could be both

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.300
The body must have been there for a while

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.300
Because no one else has been there

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:12.300
No one said anything

01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:13.300
I was feeling the cafeteria

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.300
Talking to my cat

01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:15.300
Literally all of them

01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:16.300
And then I went and shot some asteroids

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.300
It could be Imi

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:18.300
Hold on, hold on, hold on

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.300
I mean, who were you with again?

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.300
I was with Reia and Strani

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.300
Was in the room with us

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.300
When we swapped the cards

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.300
Yeah, I was with Amy

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.300
In the admin room

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.300
Yeah

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.300
Did you see Reia's body?

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.300
No, I didn't

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:29.300
No, I didn't

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.300
No, because she was alive

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.300
And then when she walked off

01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.300
And then that's...

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.300
And then I was singing a song

01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:35.300
Going somewhere else

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:36.300
Aw

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.300
And then...

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.300
I don't know

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.300
I don't know

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.300
I don't know

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.300
I don't know

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:43.300
I was walking to the med bay

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.300
And the round goes fast

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:45.300
It's Strani

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:46.300
Because Strani kills fast

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:47.300
What do you mean?

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.300
You're not...

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:49.300
Right

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:50.300
No, she could not see

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.300
I don't even know that

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:52.300
Thank you

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:53.300
Thank you

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:54.300
Thank you

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.300
Oh my god

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.300
Don't ever fucking...

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300
Anyways, we're...

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:58.300
I'm scared

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.300
I'm scared

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.300
I'm scared

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.300
Now she's shooting at us

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.300
Okay, goodbye

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.300
Imi is lost

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.300
Hi

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.300
Hi

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:08.300
What did I say?

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.300
She's a gas voter

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:10.300
She's a gas voter

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:11.300
Can we ban her, please?

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.300
She's a gas voter

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.300
Damn you

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:15.300
I thought she banned her

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.300
I'm a gas voter

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.300
I'm a gas voter

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.300
Damn, I'm a gas voter

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.300
I'm a gas voter

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:20.300
Why does it keep making me blue?

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.300
The moment she starts getting defensive and loud

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.300
She is the impostor

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.300
She's the blue nation

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.300
Sheebie, give me the benefit of the day

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.300
You're the only person in that area

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.300
Oh my god

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.300
I killed her long ago in that area

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.300
No, that's what I mean

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.300
I'm like, I had to have happened long ago

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.300
I can't believe mommy would do this

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.300
I'm sorry about that, love

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.300
I can't believe

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.300
I wasn't planning to kill you

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:43.300
I didn't know

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.300
Look, look

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.300
Listen, listen

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:46.300
Are you serious?

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.300
Are you serious?

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:48.300
Are you serious?

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:49.300
Are you serious?

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:50.300
Are you serious?

01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:51.300
Are you serious?

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:52.300
I wish you guys could see all the gesturing

01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.300
that I'm doing right now

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.300
I knew it was you twice

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:55.300
I did it

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.300
Honestly, you did

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:57.300
I will know

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:58.300
She'll eat a bowl of fish

01:19:58.300 --> 01:19:59.300
You are evil

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:00.300
No, I'll never be the next one

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.300
I didn't cover up

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:02.300
I gave you some of my chances to run away

01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:03.300
but you kept running

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.300
I mean, a gas-riding car

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.300
When the killing goes fast

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.300
and when she gets defensive

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.300
you know what's wrong

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:08.300
You said that we'd double all

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.300
You said that we'd double all

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.300
No, to be fair

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.300
you were the one

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:19.300
I'm sorry. Press the button. Thank you. Rain starts accusing her own teammates. It's rain.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:27.300
Please, I want you to feel like craved blood. I'm not fighting each other. Craved blood and death.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:35.300
I tend to accuse my teammates all the time. That's just her strass to kill her teammates.

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:43.300
I'm going to get blamed this round as well. She's hanging about over here.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:47.300
Oh no, don't die. You're so hot.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:59.300
I'm doing the card. I don't have anything here. I'm scared.

01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:03.300
Are you needing pals just to get through the game? Because it's too scary.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.300
I'm probably going to get double gold.

01:21:05.300 --> 01:21:07.300
That's terrifying.

01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:09.300
They keep targeting me.

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:23.300
It's so accusatory.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.300
Hello, press the button to start.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:29.300
Did I just close that?

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:35.300
And you've got all the way to freaking electrical mode.

01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:39.300
Who the frick is talking? I can hear someone but I don't see anyone.

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:41.300
I'm losing out.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.300
Did I not just hear someone?

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:47.300
This kid's friendly. I need my medication.

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:51.300
I literally am seeing no one.

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:59.300
It's not either of us.

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:03.300
I want everyone to tell me their location right now.

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.300
I was sniffing Shuby.

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:11.300
She was. I was doing the beds or whatever it's called.

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.300
It's not Azura. I promise you.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.300
Open up the map and tell me where you are.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:21.300
It's Mercy. I saw her run off with Rhea.

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.300
Why did you just say that right now Amy?

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.300
I just remembered because I was laughing about sniffing Shuby.

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:31.300
I saw her rain.

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:33.300
It's not me guys.

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:37.300
Are you kidding me?

01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:41.300
I'm not saying it's you. I'm saying it's rain.

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:45.300
Let me vouch for people. It's not Azura or Shuby.

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.300
I'm vouching for people right now.

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:51.300
It's definitely because Shuby was following me and then I was following Azura.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:55.300
Then Amy was sniffing my ass.

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.300
I was doing the leaves.

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.300
I don't want to ditch my gen.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.300
I don't want to accuse my gen.

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.300
You're a little bit quieter than you usually are.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.300
Johnny, why are you so quiet?

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.300
It's rain. It's rain.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.300
It's rain. It's rain.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.300
Everyone has ignored my question.

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:15.300
Everyone identify your location on the map right now.

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:19.300
I'm in storage with my fellow cafeteria.

01:23:19.300 --> 01:23:21.300
We're on our way to cafeteria.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.300
Someone's in cafeteria.

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:25.300
Me and Shuby.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.300
I was in storage with Amy.

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.300
Me, Amy.

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.300
So then Mercy and Amy then?

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:33.300
No.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.300
I was literally with Shuby.

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:39.300
I will only say that I was not with rain the entire time.

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:41.300
But then Shuby was with me the other half.

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:45.300
The other half I was not with rain.

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:49.300
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.

01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.300
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.300
I don't know if it's rain or Amy.

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.300
I don't know.

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:57.300
I think it's Mercy.

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.300
Why?

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.300
I think it's Mercy and Amy.

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.300
Trust me.

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.300
Trust me.

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:07.300
I'm voting rain.

01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.300
I don't know.

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.300
I swear to God.

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.300
It wasn't me.

01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:15.300
It wasn't me.

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.300
It wasn't me.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.300
I'm going to hold your hand the whole time.

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:21.300
I would like to also mention

01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.300
Mercy did not defend herself

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.300
once during that execution.

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:27.300
Please keep that in mind.

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.300
It's Mercy.

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.300
It's Mercy and Amy.

01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:33.300
I don't know.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.300
It's freaking Mercy and Amy.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.300
I don't know, man.

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:39.300
I don't know, man.

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.300
I don't know, man.

01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:43.300
I am not.

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.300
My mic is not picking up as normal.

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.300
Maybe I was listening to it wrong.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.300
Get to fuck you.

01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:55.300
Get to fuck you're an electrical.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:57.300
Get to fuck!

01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.300
I knew it.

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.300
Anyway, I can complete my task as a ghost.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.300
I was like, yeah, right.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:07.300
You're an electrical.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.300
I freaking doubt it.

01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.300
I'm going to defend Ezra.

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.300
Trust.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.300
Trust.

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.300
You need to pop that button.

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:19.300
Unless it's Ezra, just doing a big switch.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.300
I'm going to...

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.300
Oh, my God.

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.300
What is going on?

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.300
What is going on?

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:29.300
You can follow it.

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.300
Yeah.

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:33.300
I'm going to Mercy.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.300
I'm going to Mercy.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.300
I'm going to Mercy.

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.300
I love you a little, but I knew it was Mercy, too.

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.300
I had a feeling.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:49.300
I won't continue to gas like you!

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:55.300
When Stronny said that Mercy was quiet, that's when I knew, I was like, oh, oh, look who's low-toed now.

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:57.300
I knew it was no octave.

01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.300
I didn't get a chance to save you.

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.300
If I get changed to blue one more time.

01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.300
I saw Mercy, Mercy was the last person.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.300
About to kill.

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:08.300
Mercy, I'd like to abide my time.

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:13.300
I knew it was Mercy because Mercy was the last one with Rhea and I was trying to tell you guys that.

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:16.300
No, I know you're sipping the ass of a killer.

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:19.300
She was following me, following Azura.

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:22.300
You were following me, following Azura, makes sense now.

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:28.300
Because I was hoping that Mercy would read my mind and we would do a double, but it didn't happen.

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:32.300
Sorry, my mind play was to make my sound look more suspicious than everyone else.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.300
I don't trust the rabbit guys, man.

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.300
Well, I don't trust the, what are you, a princess?

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.300
I'm a rain cloud, man.

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:42.300
This is straight up rain cloud!

01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:49.300
What is a different rain cloud called? A cumulative member?

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.300
Oh, actually, I didn't mind that task.

01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.300
That was rather cute. I found that one rather.

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.300
No, it's hot.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.300
Okay, it's hot when I'm actually screaming and rage.

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:03.300
Oh, nothing does my, nothing really inverts my nipples.

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.300
Like being falsely accused of being impulsive.

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:07.300
I don't trust Rhea, but still.

01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:11.300
Like, it literally, oh my god, it doesn't mean so much.

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:16.300
So I was actually going to do, I'm just going to trust that everyone else goes and does that.

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:19.300
Because I think everyone's quite altruistic in the team.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:25.300
So I'm going to just focus on getting the task done like ASAP so I can get the,

01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:29.300
and before we run out of oxygen because of my lack of judgement.

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.300
She's pretending! She's pretending to do it!

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:36.300
Is no one doing oxygen or whatever the task is?

01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.300
I was trying to do oxygen!

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.300
How come no one's doing the freakin' challenge, you guys?

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:42.300
Why don't no one do the other one?

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:44.300
What? Are you shitting me?

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.300
What? Are you okay?

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.300
Reed, are you literate?

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:50.300
What are you doing?

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.300
Hello?

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.300
Are you okay?

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.300
Are you?

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:58.300
Dude.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:02.300
Legally, being legally blind is a skill issue.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.300
Yeah, sabotage. You're supposed to fix it.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.300
Dude, that was good.

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.300
Not as skill as you.

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:12.300
I just assumed everyone else was going to do it and I can't work in to be honest.

01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:14.300
Keep yourself safe!

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.300
I sabotaged nothing.

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.300
I thought you were pretending to do it.

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.300
Wait, we don't have our 8th! We don't have our 8th!

01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:23.300
Are we all here?

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.300
Are we good?

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.300
Yeah, we're here now.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.300
We got our 8th.

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.300
Oh my god.

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.300
Alright, that scared me. Sorry.

01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.300
All of it here.

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:37.300
I don't want to be a monster anymore.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:39.300
Bro, please! I want to be a monster!

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.300
Dude, I've been a monster like what five times already is crazy.

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.300
Tell me about it.

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.300
Where do you go?

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.300
Oh, Midway.

01:28:55.300 --> 01:29:00.300
Okay, Rhea now has a plausible motive because

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.300
she corrected her course.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:06.300
So, perhaps not too sassy for Latuvia.

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:09.300
That worked you.

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:11.300
You were about to vent.

01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:13.300
Swear to god.

01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:14.300
I have a scan.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:16.300
I have a scan. Who wants to watch me do a scan?

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.300
Watch you do a scan, Rhea.

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.300
Yeah, I have.

01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.300
Who wants to watch me do a scan?

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.300
You have to.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.300
Who wants to watch the scan?

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.300
I don't want to get the power.

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:27.300
Anyone want to watch a scan?

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:28.300
Only three people.

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.300
I'm doing security then.

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.300
I don't want to be mercy.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:34.300
I don't want to be any kind.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.300
I haven't seen Mercy.

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.300
I don't know if anyone's got eyes on Mercy.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.300
The serial killer of Viola.

01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:41.300
Maybe she died.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:43.300
I actually don't see her.

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.300
I've not seen her.

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.300
Okay, there's five of us. It's fine.

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.300
There's five of us. It's fine.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.300
I'm scanning.

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.300
Is she scanning?

01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.300
Okay.

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.300
Mercy just kills her.

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:05.300
She just kills her.

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.300
She just kills her.

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:09.300
Rhea, wait.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:11.300
Hold on.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.300
Rhea, why did you walk right past that?

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:15.300
Because I was coming out of the scan.

01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:17.300
I was coming out of the scan.

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:19.300
No, no, no. Rhea's fine.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.300
I watched your scan.

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:23.300
I watched Mercy kill.

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.300
After we all came out of bed.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:27.300
I was on the scan.

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:29.300
I was on the scan.

01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.300
I saw Azura coming out of the scan.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.300
I killed Strawny.

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.300
She made kills.

01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:37.300
Why would you do that?

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.300
She just made kills.

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:41.300
Where did you find Rhea?

01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:43.300
She was in Med Bake.

01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:45.300
I watched her do a scan.

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:47.300
With Strawny.

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:49.300
And then Mercy kills.

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:51.300
It's not Azura. I'm just vouching for her.

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:53.300
I saw Azura walk in that direction.

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.300
I'm gonna ask her whatever it's called.

01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.300
It's the navigation. I think she's fine.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.300
Think...

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.300
It's Mercy.

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:09.300
I'm gonna be really upset because I-

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.300
Why did you report her body?

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.300
You walked right past it Mercy.

01:31:13.300 --> 01:31:15.300
I did it.

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:17.300
Mercy you're terrible.

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:21.300
It's Mimosa and Mercy.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:27.000
I don't know. I think it's you

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:30.140
in the body. I was I was the

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:31.480
one who reported it. I wasn't

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:34.620
there. Yeah. No, Mamosa's fine.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.640
Mamosa's fine. I did it. I

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.720
did it. I did it. I did it.

01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:44.920
I did it. I ran to Mamosa in

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:48.360
fear. Yeah, you vote for

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.960
how does it fatal mating

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:56.640
girly Pop that's why she's

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:04.380
Nothing's is going on. We

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.440
don't have to worry about a

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:15.120
Are you sure I mean you were

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.620
forgive you because you didn'

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.620
your collaboration.

01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:23.620
Your collaboration to figure it out is Rhea.

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:26.620
Rhea is a you.

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.620
No, but I skinned.

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.620
Your pitch raised a little bit when you said that.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.620
If I was lying, my pitch wouldn't change.

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.620
And she'd be watching me skin.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.620
Yeah, Rhea is fine.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:41.620
Rhea is cool.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.620
I mean, Red Bay, um,

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:54.620
I have no idea who the other person is, I'm not skilled enough to know, but I'm glad everyone's enjoying my gameplay.

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.620
Yeah, I'm sorry to say I haven't sabotaged.

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:04.620
She's focused, she's locked in.

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:10.620
It's not me, I promise. I'm just sussing you out a little bit.

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:12.620
I don't know.

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.620
Hopefully.

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.620
Listen, it's one of the joes, it's Mercy Rosa, I bet.

01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.620
One of the joes.

01:33:18.620 --> 01:33:20.620
Mercy, go call and just retake me.

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:22.620
Mita!

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:24.620
It's not me!

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:26.620
It's just one of the joes.

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.620
Wait, is it rain?

01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.620
No, it's not.

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:36.620
Oh my god, no, it's not.

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:38.620
Alright, go on.

01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:40.620
Shibi, it's not.

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:42.620
Do it, do it, do it.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.620
It's not me, it's not me.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.620
It's Imi, she's gonna do it.

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:48.620
It's not!

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:50.620
Wait, what if you do it in the other person's report?

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.620
Fine, go do it rain, go on.

01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.620
No, you do it, you do it, it's you.

01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:56.620
I can't kill other people's stuff.

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.620
Go on then, show what you mean.

01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.620
I'm gonna check on Azera and Rhea then.

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:02.620
Oh my god.

01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:08.620
Oh my god.

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:10.620
I've been on fuck.

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:12.620
Just meant to kill someone.

01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.620
No, look, it's Azera or Rhea.

01:34:14.620 --> 01:34:16.620
Look, the three of us will stick together, promise.

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:18.620
Where's Azera?

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:20.620
That's what I'm saying.

01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.620
Oh, I gotta go back to Midnight, just FYI.

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:24.620
What?

01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:26.620
Whispering to yourself, Azera.

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:30.620
See it?

01:34:30.620 --> 01:34:32.620
No way.

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.620
Why were you whispering?

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.620
You sounded weird.

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:38.620
You said, where did she go?

01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.620
Where did she go?

01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.620
That's what I said.

01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:44.620
I asked Rhea, where did she go?

01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:46.620
Amy, are we killing?

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:48.620
Or did she actually go, it might be like...

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:50.620
No.

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:52.620
No.

01:34:56.620 --> 01:34:58.620
Oh, I don't need that.

01:34:58.620 --> 01:35:00.620
Hi, Mims.

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:02.620
We're not talking?

01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:04.620
We're not talking?

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:06.620
I don't know about that.

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.620
I just don't know about that.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.620
I don't know, I don't know.

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:12.620
I haven't checked Electrical in a while.

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:14.620
Maybe somebody died.

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.620
Maybe somebody died in Electrical.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.620
Let me check it out.

01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.620
Honestly, Momosa's pretty smart, though.

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.620
If anything, you're probably gonna die in there.

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:24.620
No, dude, can somebody fucking kill somebody damn?

01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:26.620
If it's you, Azera.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.620
It's ending.

01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:30.620
Probably Mims, I don't know.

01:35:30.620 --> 01:35:32.620
I'm just accusing everyone.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.620
It's a double take, but then she realized somebody was nearby.

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.620
Hmm.

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.620
You could tell somebody this information.

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:40.620
Okay, I'm gonna tell you something.

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.620
In case I die.

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.620
No.

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.620
It might be Momosa, because she did a double take,

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.620
but then she saw Rhea was nearby.

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.620
Oh, my God.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.620
It's Amy.

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:54.620
It's Amy.

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.620
Yes, Amy.

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:58.620
Oh, my God.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:00.620
Oh, my God.

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:02.620
Okay, well, it's not Momosa.

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.620
I just have an act for these sort of things.

01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:06.620
What can I say?

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.620
Because she didn't accuse me even though I was seen on the TV.

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.620
Oh, no.

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:12.620
Rain was with me.

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.620
Rain was with me.

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:16.620
Yeah, I was with everyone.

01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:18.620
Rain over to Rain to tell her that I thought it was Momosa.

01:36:18.620 --> 01:36:20.620
It's not.

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.620
Because she's dead.

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:24.620
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.

01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.620
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.

01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:28.620
Momosa did a double take, and I thought she's gonna kill me.

01:36:28.620 --> 01:36:30.620
I didn't see her.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:32.620
I didn't see her killer though.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.620
Listen, if it's not Amy, it's Rhea.

01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:36.620
Trust me.

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.620
No, it's not Rhea.

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:40.620
I saw her do a body scan.

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:42.620
But she's the one that she might not have killed that round.

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.620
Sorry, Amy.

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:46.620
It wasn't Rain.

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:48.620
It wasn't Rain.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:50.620
She accused me.

01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.620
Stop killing me.

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:54.620
Oh, no.

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:56.620
Oh, my God.

01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:58.620
Wait a second.

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:00.620
It's not me.

01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.620
Are you sure?

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:04.620
Are you sure?

01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:06.620
Listen, I can't believe it's not me.

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.620
I can't believe it's not me.

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:10.620
Rhea, we're the only ones we can trust.

01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:12.620
We have to figure out

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:14.620
if it's Azura or Rain.

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.620
I think it's Rhea.

01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:18.620
It's not Rhea.

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.620
What does Rain not understand about medbay scan?

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:22.620
What does she not understand?

01:37:22.620 --> 01:37:24.620
It's not me.

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:26.620
It's not me.

01:37:26.620 --> 01:37:28.620
It's not me.

01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:30.620
No, but that was just the first time.

01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:32.620
Old people should not be a lot of play among us.

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:34.620
Rhea, we need to

01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:36.620
in the shoot room.

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.620
We have to be good on this.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.620
We need to think about our steps.

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:42.620
Okay.

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:44.620
What if it's Sheebie?

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.620
Because Rhea said that Sheebie never scanned.

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.620
So I didn't have a scan.

01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:50.620
Sheebie could be...

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:52.620
How are we going to know that?

01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.620
Sheebie could be

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.620
marinating Rhea.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.620
Yes, it's a smelly smell.

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.620
Okay, okay.

01:38:00.620 --> 01:38:02.620
Rhea, I've been nothing but defend you.

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:04.620
I'm the most.

01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:06.620
Each one of you.

01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:08.620
It was with Rain.

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:10.620
You were at admin.

01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.620
Sheebie had like five opportunities to kill me

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.620
and she never did.

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.620
Unless she's trying to gaslight.

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.620
Yes, because if we got rid of one

01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:20.620
and my B is gaslighting you

01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.620
because if Mercy was the imposter

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.620
and it's only one

01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:26.620
imposter left.

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.620
You think me and Mercy are going to be imposter together

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.620
three times in a row?

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:32.620
Yeah.

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.620
Shroney was literally imposter like four times in a row.

01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:36.620
I wouldn't believe it.

01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:38.620
Rhea, you have to...

01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:40.620
I have to vote as Rhea.

01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:42.620
No, it's not me.

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:44.620
Who do you want to vote for?

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.620
I will vote for whoever you want to vote for.

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.620
It's over.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:50.620
Alright, love, just vote me off and win.

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.620
Is that what you want? I'm not the imposter.

01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:54.620
Okay, I'm going to vote for Rhea because

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:56.620
Rain always points to you even when she's not.

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:58.620
Oh, thank god.

01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:00.620
Yippee!

01:39:00.620 --> 01:39:02.620
Yeah?

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.620
I'm sorry, is there if it wasn't you, I apologize.

01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.620
Yippee!

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:08.620
Yes!

01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:10.620
Yes, yes!

01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:12.620
Easy, easy.

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:14.620
You did it. I told you.

01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.620
I'm sorry, is there a...

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.620
I should have let you win, damn.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.620
Bouched for you.

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.620
Yeah, I had your back.

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.620
Don't forget that.

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:26.620
Man, is there a... I'm so sorry.

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.620
Where's my story, Rain?

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.620
You keep accusing me of doing anything.

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:32.620
Okay.

01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:34.620
Listen, once you're out of the game,

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:36.620
I can...

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:38.620
I'm sorry.

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.620
I'm back. I'll just stop playing the game.

01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.620
I was getting nervous because I didn't know how to defend myself.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.620
I was running around the map, which is crazy.

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:46.620
I'm just teasing, I'm sorry.

01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:48.620
I'm sorry.

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:50.620
I'm not sorry.

01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:52.620
I'm not sorry because you were so sorry.

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.620
Where's your back from pissing?

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.620
Yeah, sorry, I...

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.620
The piss girl.

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:00.620
The piss.

01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:02.620
You'll see all by yourself.

01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.620
I'll find we've been imposter at least once now.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.620
I'm gonna stop pissing.

01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:10.620
Well, at least Azura got to be imposter.

01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.620
Yeah, one time.

01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:14.620
Well, maybe you're imposter again.

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:16.620
Right now.

01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:18.620
I need the coconut prattle and that...

01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:20.620
Oh!

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:22.620
Mercy DC?

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.620
Mercy? Why did Mercy leave?

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:26.620
I don't know. I don't know if we're gonna reset.

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.620
Hold on, I'm going in the middle.

01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:30.620
Okay.

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.620
Hang out with you.

01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:34.620
Should I just call a meeting?

01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:36.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:40.620
Oh, what?

01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:42.620
What happened?

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.620
Mercy left, so we're just concerned.

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:46.620
Oh, okay.

01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:48.620
Is her internet down?

01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:50.620
She didn't die. We didn't know what happened with her internet.

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:52.620
Oh, she just got disconnected.

01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:54.620
Oh, yeah.

01:40:54.620 --> 01:40:56.620
Rain.

01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:58.620
Is it rain?

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:00.620
It's not me. It's not, guys.

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.620
I know, but it's getting her back in.

01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:04.620
Oh, okay.

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:06.620
Alright, it's...

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:08.620
Imposters come forward.

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:12.620
Oh, my God.

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:14.620
Wait, who is it? Rain or Reo?

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.620
It was Imi?

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:18.620
Yeah, Imi and Azura.

01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:20.620
Imi and Azura?

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:22.620
Oh, I fucking knew Azura got it twice in a row.

01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:24.620
Oh, you called it.

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.620
I feel bad for her.

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:28.620
The way that she said how she denied it, how she was like,

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:30.620
yeah, imagine.

01:41:30.620 --> 01:41:32.620
I was like...

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.620
We heard that flick during your voice.

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.620
Yup, yup, yup.

01:41:36.620 --> 01:41:38.620
Wait for me.

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:40.620
Ready to stand on the side of the table?

01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:42.620
Alright, I'll press the button.

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:44.620
I like pressing buttons.

01:41:44.620 --> 01:41:46.620
Press the button, girl.

01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:48.620
Two more, and then we will...

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:50.620
We will call it.

01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:52.620
Yay!

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:54.620
It's not really much of a conclusion other than us all accusing each other

01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.620
and never talking again.

01:41:56.620 --> 01:41:58.620
I know, it's so cute.

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:00.620
Wait, is Azura calling me?

01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:04.620
Azura, what do you have to say for yourself?

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:06.620
Is that your mic?

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.620
Is that someone's mic or something?

01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:10.620
That sounds like popcorn.

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.620
I was muted for a second.

01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.620
Yeah, it sounds like popcorn.

01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:18.620
Is that me?

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:20.620
Wait, you guys hear that? No, I hear that.

01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:22.620
You guys hear that?

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:24.620
Something's crunchy.

01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:26.620
Who's kissing?

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.620
Who's frying some chicken?

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.620
Is it me?

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:32.620
Someone's frying...

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.620
I don't know.

01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:36.620
I hear static.

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:38.620
I'm going to turn my voice chat dial down.

01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:40.620
I still hear it.

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:42.620
Okay, let me turn my dial down.

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.620
Hershey's back!

01:42:44.620 --> 01:42:46.620
Yippee!

01:42:46.620 --> 01:42:48.620
Yippee!

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:50.620
Definitely not me, it's not me.

01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:52.620
Is that a game?

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:54.620
Pretty cool.

01:42:54.620 --> 01:42:56.620
Wait, we can only one at a time.

01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.620
I'm going to mute right now, hold on.

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:02.620
No, you can still hear it.

01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:04.620
Okay, it's not me then.

01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:06.620
Someone's talking to me, alright.

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.620
Someone in the middle, come to the edge if it's not...

01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.620
If you don't...

01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:12.620
I'm going to mute, hang on.

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:14.620
Wait, if you hear it all...

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.620
It's gone, it's gone.

01:43:16.620 --> 01:43:18.620
I didn't mute.

01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:20.620
We're getting a guy...

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:22.620
Who's got a Geiger counter for radiation?

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:24.620
I know, seriously.

01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:26.620
Are we ready?

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.620
Are we ready?

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.620
I'm ready.

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:32.620
I'm in a voucher, I want you to be a voucher.

01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:34.620
They're gone?

01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:36.620
Okay, thank you.

01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:38.620
I believe in other ways.

01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.620
All your problems might be me.

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:42.620
It's fine.

01:43:42.620 --> 01:43:44.620
I would like for Mimosa to be a voucher.

01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:46.620
Second last game, baby!

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.620
Make it carry.

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.620
This is the last game?

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:52.620
Second last game.

01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:54.620
And then we call plain because we're the winners.

01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.620
Gorge?

01:43:56.620 --> 01:43:58.620
For a girl's 50th grade.

01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:00.620
Sixth?

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.620
Sixth, the wiring.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.620
The ones that are like the double ones

01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:10.620
where you have to go to a second location

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.620
are the ones that like trip you up the most.

01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:14.620
Like in terms of like

01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:16.620
oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:18.620
That's sick.

01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:24.620
Two or what is going on in here?

01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:26.620
Absolutely nothing.

01:44:26.620 --> 01:44:28.620
Sacrifice material.

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.620
Oh no, there's an imposter coming my way.

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:32.620
Sure would be a shame if you

01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:34.620
absolutely callywacked me for one.

01:44:34.620 --> 01:44:36.620
Where the heck is everyone?

01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.620
This is like the main room.

01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:40.620
I don't like this one but I've got a med beta.

01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:42.620
Inspect sample.

01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:44.620
Lovely.

01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:46.620
Whoa!

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:48.620
Hold on, let me put my sample on first.

01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:50.620
Let me put my sample on first and then I'll

01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.620
then I'll do it.

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.620
Okay, report.

01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:58.620
Hey Mercy!

01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:00.620
Self report, self report.

01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:02.620
Okay, it's not Shebi or Rea.

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:06.620
Mercy's dead on the med base scanning pad.

01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.620
Oh.

01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.620
I wasn't near med bay, I was all around the perimeter.

01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.620
I saw me doing the leaves.

01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:16.620
Rain and I.

01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:18.620
And I was on cams.

01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.620
Who was on cams?

01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:24.620
Wait, sorry.

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:26.620
Hold on, hold on.

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.620
Who just said scrawny, scrawny, scrawny three times?

01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:30.620
Say it one more time for me.

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:32.620
Is it Azura's mic?

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:34.620
Yeah, it's Azura, yeah.

01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:36.620
Who said scrawny three times in a row?

01:45:36.620 --> 01:45:38.620
Do it again.

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:40.620
I dare you.

01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:42.620
Strawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny,

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.620
scrawny, scrawny, scrawny, scrawny.

01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.620
Self report, self report, self report.

01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.620
It's a self report!

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:50.620
You are fired!

01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:52.620
Let her here!

01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:54.620
Let her, let Ramosa talk.

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.620
Ramosa, where were you?

01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:58.620
It's a self report.

01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:00.620
Rain and Rea were together.

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:02.620
Shebi, Rain, Rea were together.

01:46:02.620 --> 01:46:04.620
I don't know who to pick.

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:06.620
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.

01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:08.620
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.

01:46:08.620 --> 01:46:10.620
I don't know if it's scrawny or Ramosa.

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:12.620
It's scrawny and Azura.

01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:14.620
I will make you sweat later tonight.

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.620
We'll talk about it later.

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:18.620
I think it's scrawny and Ramosa.

01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.620
Oh no!

01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:22.620
I will let you sweat later tonight.

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:24.620
I don't have anything to say.

01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.620
Goodbye.

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:28.620
I'm done, baby.

01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:30.620
You didn't hear that too?

01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:32.620
Is it me?

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:34.620
No, my turn.

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:36.620
The person who reported the dead body.

01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:38.620
Yeah, Ramosa.

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:40.620
Bye.

01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:42.620
Open your mouth!

01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:44.620
Your coochie smells like trash!

01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:46.620
Oh shit!

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.620
It's scrawny!

01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:50.620
It's not me! She fucking voted me!

01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:52.620
So I thought she was sus.

01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:54.620
Dude!

01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:56.620
It's literally not me. She fucking voted me.

01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:58.620
Shebi then. Fuck you.

01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:00.620
What the fuck? Why would she so aggrieved?

01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:02.620
Wait, no. I'm not being funny.

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:04.620
Everyone's actually ganging up on me.

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:06.620
Because they can't even believe for a second

01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:08.620
that I might be a wee bit nice in this game.

01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:10.620
Like, so they just instantly get...

01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:12.620
Oh, it's a self-report. It's a self-report.

01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:14.620
Oh, go get to fuck, man.

01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:16.620
Go get to fuck, man.

01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:18.620
It's a self-report.

01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:27.620
It's a self-report.

01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:36.620
I'm sorry. I couldn't...

01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:38.620
I just kept hearing...

01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.620
I just kept hearing Mercy's ghost.

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:42.620
I know, I heard it, too.

01:47:42.620 --> 01:47:53.620
it too because I knew if I voted I feel like I would have tied it

01:47:53.620 --> 01:48:03.000
you did the same thing to me

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:22.440
listen to people I was about to like say food I was like

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:32.080
it's not about story being nice or not it's about me being dangerous which has

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:39.640
been proven in previous rounds so now none of you you scare me yeah it's true

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:43.400
and every time every time we start you always say that it's probably always

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:45.520
gonna be someone or you say that we're gonna be someone or you say that we're

01:48:45.520 --> 01:49:14.280
I don't even know if they're gonna believe that I'm just I'm gonna fuck up the game

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:18.720
they're gonna blame me for everything whenever I'm crewmate I'm just gonna fuck

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.420
up the last game and they're gonna have to play low-main games with me and I'm

01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:38.480
gonna claim that I am a naughty naughty boy okay this is just my task I did it

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:53.600
up to them to fucking figure out excuse me every round well no it's not I was

01:49:53.600 --> 01:50:03.920
actually just with Johnny you're talking to the wall talking to your chat and

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:08.120
it was quite cute so I was just standing at you so wasn't you I was with

01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:10.440
mims and

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.440
Is that the two of you?

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:19.440
I mean, it's not me, I was trying to find my toss.

01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:20.440
Yeah, it's right, I believe.

01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.440
It's right.

01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:28.440
As soon as it's her, as soon as she blames me, I know it's right.

01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:29.440
I know it's right.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:30.440
Dude.

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:34.440
She always blames me and I haven't done anything.

01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:39.440
Dude, what the three?

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:40.440
No.

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:41.440
Hold on, hold on.

01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:42.440
Her accent.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:43.440
Yes!

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:47.440
Wait, what's the dealio?

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.440
So Mamosa found the body wear.

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.440
We found side of reactor.

01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440
It was two of them.

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:55.440
Side of reactor.

01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:56.440
I was with menzen.

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.440
I was with menzen.

01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:58.440
Rea and Mamosa.

01:50:58.440 --> 01:50:59.440
Rean, sorry.

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.440
I was bouncing for menzen.

01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.440
Wait, I was bouncing for menzen.

01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.440
I don't know why she's slipping.

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.440
I'm not bouncing for rain.

01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:07.440
I'm not bouncing for rain because I didn't see.

01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.440
I don't know.

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:10.440
I was just swiping a card.

01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.440
Yeah, to be honest.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:14.440
And I told you guys to go worry about that.

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:15.440
Is it Rean and Mamosa?

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.440
Whatever, man.

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440
Was it Pinkerton?

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.440
Yeah, it's me.

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:19.440
Vote me.

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.440
Yeah.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:23.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.440
Yeah, it's Rean's being too quiet.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:26.440
Rean's being too quiet.

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.440
Thanks for voting me.

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:28.440
You're welcome.

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.440
It was very kind of you to think about me.

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:33.440
The other one is obviously Strani.

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:37.440
What did I tell you?

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:40.440
What did I tell you?

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:41.440
Strani killed me.

01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.440
Yeah.

01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.440
No, I think Strani.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.440
Open your mouth.

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.440
I'm Strani.

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:48.440
I have to do a bad bay.

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:49.440
I have to do a scan, Strani.

01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.440
Are you doing scan?

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:51.440
Go watch.

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:52.440
I'm doing fucking 60 seconds.

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.440
Countdown, spot the difference.

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:55.440
Oh my God, look at that.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.440
Oh my God.

01:51:56.440 --> 01:51:59.440
Oh my God, you're like, you're doing your thing.

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:00.440
Huh?

01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.440
Well.

01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.440
Well, it's not us anyway.

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.440
Oh yeah, it's not me and Strani.

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:07.440
We're busy there.

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.440
What's going on, guys?

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:09.440
You already know my card swipe.

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.440
Mama's on my fifth try.

01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.440
Come on.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:13.440
No, that's true.

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:17.440
Because before Rea, was it Rea or Shibi was trying to...

01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:19.440
Well, it's between Amy and Momosa.

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.440
I already did my card swipe.

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.440
It's between Amy and Momosa.

01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.440
Yeah, because me and Strani were hanging out in Med Bay.

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.440
I believe Rea's claim on the fifth card swipe.

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:30.440
Momosa, what are you...

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:31.440
Yeah, Rea is...

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.440
Momosa, say your piece.

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.440
No.

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:35.440
Goodbye.

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:38.440
See you later, ma'ams.

01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.440
I don't...

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.440
I know who it is.

01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:42.440
You will rue this day.

01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.440
I don't...

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:45.440
Oh, I don't know who to vote for.

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:46.440
I'm with Strani.

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:47.440
Okay, yeah.

01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:48.440
I was with Strani in Med Bay.

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:52.440
It's Momosa then, because literally Shibi and Shibi have been touching each other all game.

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.440
Goodbye.

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.440
Yeah, we were touching Rea in Med Bay.

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:59.440
She was doing a full body scan of my delicious bod.

01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.440
Not Momosa.

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.440
What?

01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:03.440
Momosa!

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.440
Why would you ban them like me then?

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:06.440
Momosa!

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.440
Momosa!

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:08.440
Momosa!

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.440
Wait, when I was...

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.440
Momosa!

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.440
Wait, when I was with Momosa, she could have killed me at any time.

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:15.440
And it could have been like...

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:17.440
Well, now we can't hit them.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.440
Well, now we can't hit them.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:22.440
Rea, because she just stood still and activated the fucking thing.

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:24.440
Aw.

01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.440
Yes!

01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.440
You scared me!

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.440
Okay.

01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:34.440
Wait, what?

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.440
I'm so confused.

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:40.440
Wait, can you activate sabotage's whilst on the move?

01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:45.440
Can you activate sabotage's while moving?

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.440
I don't know.

01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.440
I honestly don't know.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:54.440
If you can activate sabotage's while moving.

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:56.440
I feel like...

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.440
Can you activate sabotage's while moving?

01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:01.440
That sabotage came on while Rea wasn't moving.

01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:02.440
Aw, are you serious?

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440
What the fuck?

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.440
Wait, wait.

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.440
No!

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.440
I was only about to hit the button!

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:07.440
Is it aim?

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:09.440
Wait, what?

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:15.440
I'm gonna hide and trigger the button if you want to do the lights.

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:18.440
Please do the lights.

01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.440
They killed a mother with a baby.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.440
Did somebody leave?

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.440
I actually pulled a clutch that's actually crazy.

01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:27.440
I'm so proud of her, oh my god.

01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.440
Wait, what happened?

01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.440
Wait, what happened to everyone?

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.440
You guys don't clear the sabotage.

01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:34.440
No one ever clears the sabotage.

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.440
Oh, it's the lights!

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.440
It's the lights, so if you don't fix it...

01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:43.440
Dude, no, not the lights.

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:45.440
The lights doesn't...

01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:47.440
Yeah, I said that we won.

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.440
It said crew won.

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.440
Okay.

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:50.440
Crew won?

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:51.440
Oh, crewmates won?

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:52.440
Yeah.

01:54:52.440 --> 01:54:53.440
Oh, I thought we won.

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.440
Oh, did you finish out your tasks?

01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.440

01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:58.440
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:00.440

01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.440

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.440

01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:03.440

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.440

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.440

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:16.440
One more!

01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:17.440
I don't know what to expect.

01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:22.440
Alright, Rhea, Rhea!

01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:25.440

I didn't even clear the tasks,

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440
so I just looked at the bar.

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:45.440
I was so close to...

01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:53.920
the other imposter was it was the other imposter it was rain oh it was rain okay she pulled a

01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:57.280

gonna be honest actually kind of wish i was imposter uh yeah it's a little tip but you know

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.600
how to say like one more for luck uh in the behind the scenes are like lord of the rings in the

01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.680
whenever he like does the scene like it obviously is the director and the actors

01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:23.200
you need multiple renditions of the scene to be recorded out um and one and he always goes one

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:29.440
more for luck one more for luck which is him asking the actor to give one more scene even though

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:37.920

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:56.080
reason couldn't hear me even though i'm loud in scots like um me got a awful thought honestly i

02:03:56.080 --> 02:04:05.600
me any time it's not any i i me like that uh got hit with a scots rage i don't think you guys

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:13.680
know i was capable of that but i warned you i warned you and and everyone climbing for one more game

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:18.880
means you can be confident that they had a lot of fun good i'm glad that was so fun and it was like

02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:23.920
i actually felt a bit nervous like starting up but i feel so comfortable with the yumi plus girls

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:28.640
like they just i don't know all of us seem to be on the same page like we were all in a group

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:34.400
called one hour before figuring it out and like i started doing like a veal or meeting like kind

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:38.320
of recapping on some stuff and i'm like oh you guys couldn't listen in as well like it's just a

02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:44.400
few notes so i was like oh everyone's reached 5000 subscribers so we've got an artwork to celebrate

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:54.080
post and all that um it was hilarious yeah i'm ready for uh the after game stress relief honestly

02:04:54.080 --> 02:05:01.120
scrawny rage was that rage in that badly i kind of remember i think my rage is basically me going

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:07.680
uh so the other person stops talking so i can say my piece i think that's what my rage is hopefully

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:15.280
it's not too bad uh might have been taking the piss a little bit the whole stream was great yeah

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:22.080
you like that i'm so glad the only you only rage on someone accuses you and you're innocent

02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:27.760
oh it annoys me like it was funny don't get me wrong it was so funny but as soon as they go it's

02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:33.840
scrawny and i'm like i literally have not done a single thing like i haven't spoken i haven't

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:40.000
claimed anything oh it's scrawny i'm like okay just because the scottish person is like get at the

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:48.400
game like come on i do i have to admit my favorite thing was the double kills um when like there was

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:54.560
four of us but two of them posture going three two one oh it was so satisfying and one oh one

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:59.520
and one of the kills rea was so slow to respond she probably could have reported the body in time

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:08.880
um but she was so slow that she got yoinked um oh honestly on the mention of five came

02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:15.680

02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:01.200
