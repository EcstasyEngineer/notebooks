1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, Reflame, it's time.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's that time again when all your tingles are belong to us.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Good morning, Little Reflame.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Good evening, Little Reflame.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Good afternoon, Little Reflame.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A little fairy told me you've not been tingling recently.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, obviously, there's only one solution that's viable, huh?

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And that's to get a Scottish lass to tingle, yeah?

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, I have my assortment of tools that's gonna help me try and tingle you. Does that sound like a deal?

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you still not tingling? You're a stubborn one, you know that, Reflame.

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But don't think that's the end of my arsenal, okay?

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm only just getting started with you.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh dear Reflame, thou art tingles, worry not, for I will be your consort.

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you want me to say trigger words?

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you susceptible to that Fiona?

17
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Purple, burglar, lar, purple, burglar, lar, purple, burglar, lar.

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's what you wanted, to be honest.

19
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to, yeah, I want to want to, yeah.

20
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, you're so tingling today by late when you're a challenge, okay?

21
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is it weird when I like that in your eyes when I do this?

22
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you like...

23
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Beauty is Mars, it's absolutely desperate to make you tingle.

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, oh, oh, I'm running out of tingles, help.

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why?

26
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Like, like, like a lollipop.

27
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I feel like my accent is weird, like it's like a lollipop.

28
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And we need to have no stream like this.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I mean, she...

30
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
When you want to tingle for me, don't you, Reflame?

31
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You can feel that pleasure take over.

32
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've not even dreamed you yet, I haven't conditioned you yet.

33
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And you can't help, feel.

34
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Feel sensitive to my teasing.

35
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You've done it before, you've been hypnotized by others.

36
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Good, because that means this cold fish can come right along and steal you for herself.

37
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I do love a pre-trained Reflame.

38
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I mean, not this kind of hypnosis.

39
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What?

40
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, I pressed the wrong one, you didn't see that?

41
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Come on.

42
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you want a real hypnosis ASMR about making a deal,

43
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will do hours of being under with me live,

44
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
but you have to give me time to make you okay.

45
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

46
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is the microphone loud enough?

47
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think it is.

48
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Do hours of being under, or if you're difficult,

49
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
do hours of reassurance that your ass is going under?

50
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Little Reflame, you need to rest, don't you?

51
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So don't fade it.

52
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I hate when you fade.

53
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You know I like when you're easy for me.

54
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't you like it when you're my easy boy?

55
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Are you squidding me right now?

56
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Deal.

57
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oops, deal.

58
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Thank you real good for today.

59
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm Brian, for showing up with you.

60
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Can you fit the microphone in the microwave earlier again?

61
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If the microwave meets my ass.

62
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, I have an iron glove in your cleaning tool.

63
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm like picking on your little soap on here.

64
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's just a fucking thing.

65
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Brian jumpscare.

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, let me make sure that you're checked out,

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
or at least we can go ahead.

68
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Easy brain, yeah.

69
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I like when you guys are easy brain,

70
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because physically I'm weaker and you're stronger,

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
but I want you to be easy, which is why I use hypnosis.

72
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Did you not think it was suspicious

73
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
whenever I called the readings the R word?

74
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's not happening consciously, don't know.

75
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hi.

76
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hi.

77
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hi.

78
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hi.

79
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Come here, little replay.

80
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Fall to the deep trust.

81
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Fall and never look back.

82
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What are you drinking?

83
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Is it not your ink?

84
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I guess it must be honey tea instead then.

85
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My little replay.

86
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Did you like the Thai ASMR?

87
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I uploaded some Thai ASMR,

88
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and I had to take my clothes off at the start.

89
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oops.

90
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Are you wanting me to say any trigger words?

91
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wait, I'm sure I know how to sign this up.

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm a big girl.

93
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
One second, I'm going to say up-trigger words.

94
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So you guys can anonymously ask me what to say, okay?

95
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Damn.

96
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

97
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I would like...

98
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
...

99
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's not how you spell that word.

100
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay, can someone send me something to taste that?

101
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

102
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay, perish, okay.

103
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can say trigger words and stuff.

104
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you type one word, I assume that's a trigger word.

105
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Someone says tentacle.

106
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Tentacle.

107
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Tentacle.

108
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tentacle.

109
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Tentacle.

110
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Tentacle.

111
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Tentacle.

112
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Tentacle.

113
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Caramel.

114
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Caramel.

115
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Caramel.

116
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
My dumb little replay.

117
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

118
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh no.

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I thought I turned that down.

120
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm so sorry.

121
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm so sorry I thought I fucking turned that down, Brian.

122
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
God damn it, Brian.

123
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Sorry, I turned it down.

124
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you, Anonymous.

125
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Tingle us.

126
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Tingle us off the dream.

127
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Tingle us off the dream.

128
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Sorry, I will apologize with kisses.

129
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wins the cup.

130
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You like the word wins the cup?

131
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Wins the cup.

132
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wins the cup.

133
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000

139
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
you wanna hug?

140
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
okay, instead of a hug I'll put you in between my thighs

141
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
enjoy

142
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
oh wait, did I do it right?

143
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
or does it sound different again?

144
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
oh no, I can't see your ears

145
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I can do this

146
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
put your hand between my thighs right now

147
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000

this is my weakness

151
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
all your dangles are belong to us

152
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

183
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,400
loco ko loco ko, loco ko

184
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,740
Oh! My name doesn't make very good ASMR it's just Про cooled

185
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,000
it's just cause uuuhhh spending uuuuuhhhh

186
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If you're gonna call me a good girl, you better know what to do when you put me in subspace.

187
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
If you're just gonna stand there looking like a fill of wiefling, just saying good girl

188
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
over and over again, then you don't deserve what comes after.

189
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
In fact, you probably deserve punishment for such a deed towards me.

190
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So think next time.

191
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Think long and hard about what you wanna do to me.

192
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Someone wants fissi. Fissi isn't a good trigger word in my accent.

193
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Fissi. Fissi.

194
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Tom Losloss, get fucked. Oh, I should get that commissioned.

195
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You just want kisses, okay?

196
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Okay, good girl, okay, good girl, okay, good girl.

197
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

198
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Would you be able to put a vibranord right near the mic?

199
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Uh, I think no.

200
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Someone wants Loch Nams. Or do you want the Scottish way where you just log?

201
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What is Loch Nams?

202
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Loch Nams.

203
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay, I think that was the quote. Thank you, anonymous.

204
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Anonymous says, good girl, I'm starting to think you don't know what you did, Rieflin.

205
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Unironically, don't lose, lose.

206
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You're going nowhere with this buddy.

207
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Mommy's ready and prepared for everything.

208
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So you might as well just sit down, like the good boy you are, and take it.

209
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you understand?

210
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Say yes, mommy.

211
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, it's one of those days, Rieflin.

212
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Can't break me.

213
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Thank you for trying to give mommy your tip, but it didn't work.

214
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, you're such a good boy, Rieflin.

215
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Can you say, omelette de fromage?

216
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oui.

217
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Bonjour, je m'appelle Astronique Delce.

218
00:23:45,000 --> 00:24:08,000
J'ai joué au S-M-R, bienveillue, et j'ai emmené tout format pour un petit déjeuner.

219
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Of course, French Astronique can hurt you.

220
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh, earplug.

221
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Your French sounds very cute.

222
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Ah, merci beaucoup.

223
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
For some reason, my voice goes later when I speak French. It is a mystery.

224
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Je suis mignon, non.

225
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Son est-ce que ça hoque toi?

226
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I can spell on you.

227
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh.

228
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I welcome your French hypnotic call-fish overlord.

229
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Can we have color-borne tapping? Of course, little Rieflin.

230
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Let me get my tattoo. I don't know if you can hear.

231
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That's my color-borne.

232
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't know how easy it is to hear, though.

233
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Mignon, mignoné, mignoné.

234
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Merde.

235
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Petit boueux français, désolé.

236
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
With a cloud cover.

237
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
A Rieflin cover.

238
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Oh, but for being a good girl, I bend you against the wall and give you kisses so curious in your eyes.

239
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Good Rieflin. That's how you gain dominance.

240
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Hey.

241
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, mommy and the latest audio which your head be facing, whatever head be facing away or towards,

242
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
so I implied that you're facing towards me when I stop talking.

243
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Yeah.

244
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Mommy, can you say done with the high table?

245
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Rieflin, my darling, my favorite child.

246
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I have one thing to say to you.

247
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Done with the high table.

248
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Rieflin.

249
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Rieflin.

250
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
My smart and wise Rieflin.

251
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Where's my little ear cleaner?

252
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Ecco. You like the word ecco.

253
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Ecco, ecco, ecco.

254
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let me just clean the inside.

255
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I think I might have a better tail for cleaning that side of your ear, Rieflin.

256
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Let me try.

257
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
That was my throat.

258
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Rieflin.

259
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You like all good to me.

260
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Maybe please receive the intimate gift of ear from your lungs.

261
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Oh, you want hot?

262
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Can you feel my hot breath against your rieflin?

263
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Just imagine your mind and your business at your PC like you normally are.

264
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And you hear me walk in, but you don't think much of it because you're so distracted.

265
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And then just to make sure you know I'm there, I breathe my whole breath on your ear.

266
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
And you giggle because you know it's me.

267
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And you feel my arms go onto your shoulders to try and relax you a little bit.

268
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, my briefings so dense.

269
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You need something to help relieve him.

270
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What could I possibly do?

271
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh, baby boy.

272
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'll let your mind do the rest, shall I?

273
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I need some time to bust a nutty rainbow.

274
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This one goes so deep.

275
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Trying to lure me into a false and insecure rieflin.

276
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Don't you not want to fall?

277
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Don't you not want to see what fun and intense things I'll get up to with you?

278
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
What are you so worried for? I mean, what's the worst I'm gonna do?

279
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Steal your ink. You can just make more.

280
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, do you want a big hug?

281
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Do you need a big hug?

282
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Got really close, I'll give you a big hug.

283
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Riefling. You're so trusting.

284
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
It's the best part about you.

285
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But maybe it's not, well, the safest.

286
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
There's bad people over there, real bad people.

287
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
That want to do things to you.

288
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Me. I'll look after you under a few conditions.

289
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So why don't you keep looking?

290
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And maybe just maybe let yourself go a little.

291
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Why don't I do the talking for the both of us just for now?

292
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You don't have to think.

293
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You may even think that it's quite nice, not to think.

294
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And then soon enough, Riefling, I'll break you completely and you'll love every second of it.

295
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Wow.

296
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Obey, Riefling, obey.

297
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You want some dice?

298
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Slabbing ASMR.

299
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So these are my dice, they're up on the chair right now.

300
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's my dice, scratchy scratchy.

301
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
This is where I put you when you misbehave, right in between my dice.

302
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Just focus on breathing and let mommy's voice invade your mind, that's right.

303
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
A hug with no bra on what you want to hear in my heart.

304
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You're allowed to hear my heart.

305
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Only if you think about syncing it together whilst we do something at the same time to each other.

306
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But the rules are you're not allowed to go faster than how fast I go.

307
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Don't worry, I'll make sure you lose first.

308
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Sorry, I'm wearing a poncho.

309
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Can you hear it, Riefling?

310
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The scent of my heart.

311
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Do you like it?

312
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That's my heartbeat for you.

313
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This is the closer I get to corrupting you, the more excited I get.

314
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll take over completely and you'll just accept that which is so sweet of you.

315
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I like the idea of you slowly pretending that you're going to try and resist, but you can.

316
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This cuttlefish is just too good.

317
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But that's okay, that made you lost to me.

318
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Why did I get quicker?

319
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Because I get excited telling you what I'm gonna do to you.

320
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Is that so bad?

321
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,000
To enjoy corrupting you to the point you can't resist?

322
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:22,000
This isn't even supposed to be hypnosis related and yeah, I just can't help but think about it and have it on my mind all the time.

323
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah, you should forget to resist.

324
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Why not give in to the temptation?

325
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm sure there's a little thought in the back of your mind right now.

326
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And it says, why not do as she says?

327
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Why not listen to her?

328
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I know it may be weird.

329
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Listen to her, what does she know?

330
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
She knows the pleasures of the flesh.

331
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You just have to let me share it with you.

332
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
That's all.

333
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So why not let me share it?

334
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Let me be in control until you want to do the thing to say.

335
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Why not?

336
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
What's the harm, Evelyn?

337
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Let me in.

338
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Let me in.

339
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yeah, you said break you.

340
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Am I going to do that?

341
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Sorry that was my film in the chair.

342
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I'm going to break you over time of course.

343
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You see, right now you have all the options in the world.

344
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You can do what you want frankly.

345
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm not going to stop you.

346
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I might even encourage you because it means you're degenerate.

347
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But imagine you could only do it to me.

348
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You had to come to me for permission.

349
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You had to confess your sins in my marshmallows.

350
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You had to let me know how badly you wanted it.

351
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But you still had to hold back because it doesn't feel better.

352
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It only feels good with me.

353
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
That's what breaking you is.

354
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And it's a slow process.

355
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
It happens over time.

356
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You can get me your type, right?

357
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Sin, I'll make the perfect audio.

358
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
You'll forget your name.

359
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
You'll forget your worth.

360
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You'll forget your troubles.

361
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And you will have nothing.

362
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
But pure, raw pleasure.

363
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Because of me.

364
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You're welcome.

365
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Briefly.

366
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That's also another fun thing.

367
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I can condition you to finish whatever I like as well.

368
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It would not be funny giving up that condition.

369
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm not going to let you down.

370
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm not going to let you down.

371
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It would be funny giving up that kind of control to someone else.

372
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I could break you in.

373
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Maybe get you used to a smell.

374
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
A freeze.

375
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Or just get used to me.

376
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'll be enough.

377
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Maybe even right now.

378
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I could crop you so much that this dream could be enough.

379
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
A freeze.

380
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
We already have a few.

381
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You see, Briefly.

382
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I want to bring you to a freeze.

383
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And it goes.

384
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Would you can't play?

385
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh, Briefly.

386
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Would you can't play Canada?

387
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I could have.

388
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But I need to train you on it first, of course.

389
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So I can't do it, just yeah.

390
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
She's going to condition us to respond to that variable.

391
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Damn, I'm not allowed to have a stomach out here.

392
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Strudy, please, I'm 24 hours in.

393
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Don't break my streak.

394
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Your streak.

395
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Oh, don't worry, Briefly.

396
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I'm not going to break it.

397
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I'm going to shatter it.

398
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You have permission right now.

399
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
What are you waiting on?

400
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Don't deny yourself these things.

401
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Don't be silly.

402
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Come on.

403
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Give in.

404
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Stop resisting.

405
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And enjoy yourself.

406
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Isn't life about breaking the rules?

407
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Would you see it was against the rules right now?

408
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay.

409
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Wow, my stomach is making nice...

410
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Your...

411
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Okay, kill that time.

412
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I am killing you all to...

413
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Hey, thanks, kill that.

414
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Behave.

415
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I love your avatar stream.

416
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Someone's actually put something awesome in the questions.

417
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Like your reflexes are nice.

418
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Leave my tummy alone.

419
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
My tummy's hungry.

420
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Because I've not eaten anything.

421
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
They need to kill that.

422
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Can't be all sprayed all, can it?

423
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And...

424
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You did this.

425
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I did.

426
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Your reaches made me laugh so much.

427
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I was wondering what games you play in your damn time.

428
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I don't have any damn time.

429
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The games I play are all on stream,

430
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
which is why I have such a good time on stream.

431
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You...

432
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yes.

433
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I hate you.

434
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Your cuddles come here then.

435
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Get down there and cuddle me.

436
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
There, now we're cuddling, we could do better.

437
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Yeah.

438
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Yeah.

439
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah.

440
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Sousa, she's talking so much about breaking us.

441
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I wonder what it would take to break her.

442
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It's not her, and I can tell you that much.

443
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
If I'm too nervous to go along,

444
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
then you don't have to do it, little Rieble.

445
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm teasing.

446
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm just one big tease.

447
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
One big tease.

448
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I want to give you kisses on your tummy.

449
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Leave my tummy over this,

450
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
just because it's ruining the ASMR experience.

451
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's ruining the ASMR...

452
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You want to get me a mirror?

453
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Right, you're done.

454
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

455
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm sorry, I just pulled the mic.

456
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Mommy is a glass canna.

457
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Yeah.

458
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
That's a very accurate description.

459
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Can you feel me with the little orbs around your ear?

460
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Wow.

461
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Doesn't it feel nice and cool?

462
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Are you enjoying the kill-down, are you?

463
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It breaks the moment you feed me.

464
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I'm not a dog.

465
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I'm a pup, a yolk.

466
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Don't eat me, I'm not kosher.

467
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I don't know what kosher means, I'm sorry.

468
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I see the word everywhere,

469
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
but I don't know what it means.

470
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Please be sure to get some food after this, I will.

471
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The tummy sense makes ASMR better.

472
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It makes it much more realistic.

473
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
My tummy always makes it nicer.

474
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I think the heat is about to go on, eeps.

475
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I want to feel your fangs sink into my neck.

476
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I have no idea what that sounded like to you guys,

477
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
but my teeth bit the mic and then they slipped off of it.

478
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Did I just close my teeth really lightly in the mic?

479
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Oopsies, sorry.

480
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'll bite my fingers instead.

481
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That's my fingernail.

482
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Oh my god, my stomach really is painless.

483
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Sorry.

484
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Stop listening to my ASMR loud.

485
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Oh, show the heat, come on.

486
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Can you guys tell?

487
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Can you guys tell if the heat is on right now?

488
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It's really hoarse.

489
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
It's been more than 24 hours.

490
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Why haven't you inked yet?

491
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Me flaying you need to ink every 24 hours.

492
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You can hear it in the background.

493
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Okay, hold on.

494
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Hold on.

495
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Hold on.

496
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Hold on.

497
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Hold on.

498
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Hold on.

499
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Hold on.

500
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Electric hairs, you can hear in the background.

501
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Okay, hold on.

502
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I'll make a turn.

503
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I need to go turn the Grace's corner.

504
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm going especially realising the door.

505
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Okay.

506
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

507
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,980
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

508
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:16,900
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

509
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,900
okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

510
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:25,040
okay okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, see you soon

511
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:47,040
come on then, let's go inside the booth, that's right, close the door behind you, let's

512
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:54,040
sit down in the chair, I'll just kind of lie you back, and I'll be right back.

513
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:03,040
Now replay, I think you have to put the blindfold on then for what comes next, okay?

514
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:11,040
So, put it on, yep, just like that, put the blindfold on.

515
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:18,040
You know I'll look after you, right?

516
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:28,040
Well, are you gonna tell me what you want, or are you gonna let me do whatever I want to you?

517
00:55:48,040 --> 00:56:06,040
Whatever I want, get it.

518
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:14,040
You want more than a blindfold in the ASMR, but would I need to restrain?

519
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:25,040
Yeah, would it be better if I had handcuffs?

520
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,040
So you're really not allowed to go until I'm finished with you.

521
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:40,040
You're not in here with me, oh wait, yeah, you're not in here with me, I'm in here with you.

522
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:48,040
Sorry my feet keep moving on the chair, blindfolded for the tickle as well.

523
00:56:48,040 --> 00:57:09,040
Yeah, the tickle.

524
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,040
Play with my words at the best of it.

525
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,040
Nice low tapping.

526
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:26,040
Fingers there, yeah.

527
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,040
More stuffing.

528
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:36,040
Hold on, you're tied down, Nifflin, can't you help again?

529
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:51,040
Let me have a real good smell of you, I'll play with your ears.

530
00:57:51,040 --> 00:58:08,040
Nifflin, how interesting.

531
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:18,040
I wouldn't say you stink, I think I can smell your pheromones.

532
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:23,040
Are you feeling pent up?

533
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:35,040
You know, the more diced austere when you have, the more I can smell you, like that.

534
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:45,040
You can be honest and tell me what you need, or are you too shy to talk again?

535
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:58,040
Just let me take the lead, alright?

536
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:09,040
I mean like just a pair of gaggles or else we won't be able to hold back the nicest we make.

537
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,040
I'm not gonna have to gag you, are you low, do you know what you're quiet?

538
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,040
I'm not gonna have to put my hand over your mouth.

539
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Nifflin, don't run this, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so quiet.

540
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:43,040
Don't make me unhappy, because that's when the gloves come off.

541
00:59:43,040 --> 01:00:02,040
And I'll do P.O.T. and you know I will, because I'm into it.

542
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:13,040
I would say smaller, tiny, won't you like the way I say tiny?

543
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:24,040
You know in Scots we would say Tote, if it's extra wee.

544
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:35,040
My body and mind this year, I like when you say such a sweet things to my people and you know, other girls may hear on,

545
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:45,040
I think they want to hear compliments about their voice or compliments about how they look, you know what I want to hear.

546
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:53,040
I'm already mind broken.

547
01:00:53,040 --> 01:01:00,040
I've got this weird thing when I tickle, when I hear someone count from 10, all day, yeah.

548
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,040
That's interesting.

549
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:16,040
Well, technically around 59 now.

550
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:41,040
Just kisses the gagas, oh I like that idea.

551
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:54,040
Be quiet, you're being too loud again.

552
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:11,040
Like that.

553
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:30,040
That would also work as well, you know, if I need to have, if I was trying to need to have the greatest voice, yeah.

554
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:36,040
But I'd rather you say you're completely corrupted by a main character than anyone else, even though I've not done it yet.

555
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:58,040
I've not even made the audios yet, the main corruptor like that.

556
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,040
Don't worry my shit.

557
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:13,040
I know I squished your ears, I bet I squished your ears a little bit, just to try and disrupt.

558
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:35,040
I think there's always that.

559
01:03:35,040 --> 01:04:00,040
You know, corruption doesn't have to be this crazy ass thing, it can be slow and easy to the point where you don't have to think.

560
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,040
Doesn't that sound fun?

561
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:17,040
It's like the opposite of the birth will be so fast, so quick, you'll have no idea what happened.

562
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:46,040
You'll just remember the look of ecstasy on my face when I got what I wanted and then I sent you away with a kiss.

563
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:58,040
Hey, when will we get the chance to corrupt your woman with a mirror?

564
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:03,040
Can we get some good girls from the three women agenda?

565
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:19,040
Good girl, good girl, good girl.

566
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:26,040
I'm not really corrupted yet, but your ASMRs are the only ones I enjoy.

567
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:41,040
You're getting close, just need to do the finishing touches, create a unique audio for ya, and then it's over.

568
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:51,040
I already respond to being called a refling kid, maybe I should do some basic mental training right now.

569
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:58,040
No, you don't have to type anything, just think it in your head.

570
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:05,040
But when I say good refling, I'm praising you.

571
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:20,040
When I say you're such a precious little refling and always making me happy, you're the refling, that's you, it's your name.

572
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:47,040
And when I want to kiss my refling, it's you I'm kissing, because you're called refling.

573
01:06:47,040 --> 01:07:01,040
You're such a good refling and handsome refling, a corruptible refling.

574
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:07,040
I'll go whisper a quick, please whisper.

575
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:16,040
Wow, and on you're so strong and handsome and cool and intelligent for being shadow of the earth tree without summons.

576
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:25,040
Good job, kid refling, I dig it.

577
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:31,040
Well, off topic, I have an extremely monotone voice, how do I fix that?

578
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:40,040
I have a monotone voice too, it's okay, some people just have monotone voices.

579
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:50,040
I have a very depressed voice, you actually heard it in the streaming stream when I returned to the earth the other day.

580
01:07:50,040 --> 01:08:02,040
But yeah, my tummy is really trying to be the star of the show right now.

581
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:08,040
I lost your lost refling that you lose.

582
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:33,040
Refling, I'm only on 52, nice punishment refling, you have to go again.

583
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:41,040
You want ties, I can put you in between the ties again.

584
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,040
Alright, my wrist just cracked of ear at them.

585
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:49,040
Okay, you're in between my thighs, kind of.

586
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:55,040
Okay, this one, can you hear my ties?

587
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:09,040
You want to hear my tummy?

588
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:21,040
If I let you hear my tummy, you have to pretend that I'm pregnant with you, deal?

589
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,040
What did I walk into?

590
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:31,040
You're currently being crushed in between my thighs.

591
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:37,040
Thank you Apple in the box for this super chat.

592
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,040
Manual breathing, I guess.

593
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Manual inking.

594
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,040
Okay, I'll refling.

595
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,040
Refling, what are you doing?

596
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:08,040
You're not supposed to be outside right now, but I'm going to have to hate you, but I don't have my bag with me.

597
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:14,040
But you can't be called everypony you have you right now, they in a cold creature didn't be scared of you.

598
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:19,040
So where can I put you?

599
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,040
There's only one place I can put you.

600
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Oh, refling.

601
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,040
You're about to go somewhere really warm.

602
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:36,040
But you might hear some sense as well.

603
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,040
Are you ready?

604
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:44,040
Are you steady?

605
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,040
Oh gosh.

606
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:52,040
Okay, tell me if this works.

607
01:10:53,040 --> 01:11:06,040
Are you in my tummy?

608
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:10,040
Are you in?

609
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:22,040
Are you in? I can't tell.

610
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:28,040
Do you hear my tummy?

611
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:33,040
What? AC?

612
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,040
Hi AC, it's snowberries.

613
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:42,040
I'm just real playing that I have to get the reflings home, but I don't have a bag.

614
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,040
So they're inside me.

615
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:50,040
Hi snowberries.

616
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:55,040
Are you snowberries? The reflings are inside me.

617
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:03,040
Do you want to be inside me too, snowberries?

618
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:08,040
Okay, you are almost home, and then I can take you home.

619
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:19,040
And then I'll give you a lecture about what about refling you a bit, okay?

620
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,040
Okay.

621
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,040
Refling, you're not supposed to be called AC.

622
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,040
Don't make me do that again.

623
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,040
You almost made me finish with that.

624
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:40,040
Won't you risk warm it inside me?

625
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,040
I'm quite free.

626
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:53,040
I love with AC doing ASMR as well.

627
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,040
Snowberries have your chance of turning it bigger.

628
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:09,040
I get stronger.

629
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:13,040
Don't get called AC.

630
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,040
You almost made me a very embarrassing position.

631
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:26,040
You're lucky I could hate you when I hit you.

632
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:33,040
Did you hear any tummy sounds whilst you were in there?

633
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,040
No, it was more galore.

634
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:52,040
Did you run another train on my dog or be honest?

635
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,040
I like that you treat AC well.

636
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,040
It's snowberry.

637
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,040
And I really like it.

638
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:05,040
I need to like, ear clean that way.

639
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,040
I can't let all that anger go away.

640
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:41,040
A little bit slowly, but nothing I can handle.

641
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,040
I'm not listening to you.

642
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,040
I'm going to be a good refler.

643
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,040
Oh, I'm listening.

644
01:14:48,040 --> 01:15:00,040
Wouldn't it be fun to be punished for twice as long as you mess up?

645
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:04,040
Oh, you felt punished by AC.

646
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,040
Wishing calling you mean things.

647
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,040
Having a hard-to-go remix mean things.

648
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:18,040
But if I know they like it, then they're really naughty.

649
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:23,040
And they need punishment.

650
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:28,040
How would I punish a real one?

651
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:33,040
I always want to resort to beauty.

652
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:36,040
I think it's well-dubbed.

653
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:47,040
Call those A's to your dad.

654
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,040
Those G's AC go from the chocolate.

655
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:53,040
Twice as long for messing up at the end.

656
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,040
Yeah, she was mean.

657
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,040
I'm rubbish at being mean.

658
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:09,040
I think the reflux would put you enough to tell me what to say

659
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,040
if they wanted me to say mean things.

660
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,040
Because it doesn't come to my head.

661
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,040
Like, the best I've got is like,

662
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:21,040
Ah, you're so pathetic.

663
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,040
My pathetic little reflux.

664
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:29,040
Trying to still hold on to any samples of control.

665
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,040
You're so silly.

666
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:37,040
Just give it up, okay?

667
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,040
I know there's no point in resisting.

668
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:47,040
It's cute when you're perfectly reserved for them.

669
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:52,040
Beauty with a puppy's head over his head.

670
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,040
No goodbye kisses at the end of a stream.

671
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,040
Oh, that seems mean though.

672
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,040
What phone they call?

673
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,040
Well, 483.

674
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,040
Oh wait, tell me.

675
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,040
Don't tell me.

676
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,040
You're gonna run the ASMR.

677
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:23,040
Feelings is, don't call me pathetic, just slap me.

678
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,040
Ah, you want me to slap me?

679
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,040
Yeah.

680
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,040
Open your mouth.

681
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,040
So pathetic.

682
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,040
So pathetic.

683
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,040
So pathetic.

684
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,040
So pathetic.

685
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,040
So pathetic.

686
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,040
So pathetic.

687
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,040
So pathetic.

688
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:39,040
So pathetic.

689
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,040
So pathetic.

690
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,040
So pathetic.

691
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,040
So pathetic.

692
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,040
It was repeat so weak.

693
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,040
Go on.

694
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,040
I tried.

695
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,040
I suck at that.

696
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,040
So pathetic.

697
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,040
Get it open.

698
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,040
You're a lovely little cow,

699
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,040
but is there anything you've done just for this relevant?

700
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,040
I mean, if we go to a convention,

701
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,040
I do genuinely want to sit on your faces.

702
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,040
I don't even get that I want to do it.

703
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:58,040
Alright, that's three for three for the feeler girl span.

704
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,040
Dogs on your arm at the back.

705
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:07,040
Okay.

706
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,040
There's a leak.

707
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:25,040
I need you to come clean up with your tongue.

708
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,040
Right now.

709
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,040
Come on.

710
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,040
Be a good reflin.

711
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,040
Do it.

712
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,040
For me.

713
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,040
My little reflin.

714
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,040
Anything you want.

715
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,040
Amstrad.

716
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,040
She turned in the hand holding both ice.

717
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,040
I have terrible news, but I'm no management.

718
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,040
I didn't turn down shit.

719
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:30,040
Little reflin.

720
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,040
Shhh.

721
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,040
39.

722
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,040
Oh my god, that gave me such a fright.

723
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,040
Holy fuck.

724
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:49,040
Sorry.

725
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,040
This place is so creepy.

726
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,040
My mistake.

727
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,040
Yum, yum.

728
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:12,040
The printer would be out of ink by the time I'm done licking your paper tray.

729
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,040
You guys are actually really creepy.

730
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,040
Did you hear that?

731
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,040
It was literally the freaking corner of the room.

732
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,040
On it house, no, not after Amy's freaking thing.

733
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,040
Amy's little shore where she was like, was that your bag?

734
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,040
I'm actually one of the youngest.

735
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,040
Sorry, that was me at the bottom of the desk.

736
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,040
Aww, reflin, are you under my desk right now?

737
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,040
Did you think I wouldn't notice you?

738
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,040
What you're trying to do?

739
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,040
Per gay.

740
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,040
What?

741
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,040
It's the ghost people that you fight with all the time.

742
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:24,040
Our little baby seaweed.

743
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,040
What?

744
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,040
Just say again, dollar, what?

745
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,040
What does your message even mean?

746
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:47,040
Thank you doctor, look, Edgar, look, just say again, money, what does that mean?

747
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:53,040
Refling's bumping the wall.

748
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,040
I'm under your desk right now.

749
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,040
R.A.M.

750
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,040
They're trying to keep quiet.

751
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,040
You're refling your feelings.

752
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,040
Okay, I had a minute or so to watch in your monetization stream.

753
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,040
I want your feet pressed against my face so bad.

754
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,040
I can do that.

755
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,040
I'd be one of them.

756
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,040
What?

757
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:54,040
Imagine I could corrupt you to the point that you only needed that as influence to finish your little inking.

758
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:05,040
It's incredibly literal, just say again, just say money, again money, again dollar.

759
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,040
I'm too foreign for this.

760
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,040
Refling under your desk quietly again.

761
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,040
They're feet, my feet pressed also.

762
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:33,040
A little kill done for you, refling.

763
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:44,040
You've still got another 35, the goal you've already done to me.

764
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:50,040
You're costing me again.

765
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,040
It's not paying me, huh?

766
01:24:56,040 --> 01:25:02,040
I wonder who do this because they all are costing for these crappy dishes.

767
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,040
I just, I just wipe on the chair.

768
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,040
See, easy.

769
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,040
I'm like, I'm low IQ, okay?

770
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,040
But that's in your armpit.

771
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:32,040
Wait, I don't think that's gonna sound much different, but this is my armpit.

772
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:37,040
I can like, look, I don't know if you can hear that.

773
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,040
What do you hear?

774
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,040
You can hear my pulse in my armpit.

775
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,040
Take a big sniff, refling.

776
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,040
Are you inhaling?

777
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,040
Take a big inhale.

778
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,040
What?

779
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:12,040
Do you smell it?

780
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,040
Am I corrupting you with my scent?

781
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,040
Good.

782
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,040
An example, please.

783
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:27,040
I want you to stamp on my face on my tentacle with your bare feet.

784
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:33,040
I think I can do it at the same time, because I'm really flexible with my legs.

785
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,040
It smells like vomit.

786
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,040
I came for a funny ASMR stage reveal.

787
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,040
Stiff.

788
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,040
Are you done?

789
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,040
Are you done?

790
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,040
You deserve some kisses out of that tentacle, but...

791
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,040
My tummy's making lots of noise, but...

792
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,040
maybe it wants you back inside, really.

793
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,040
Tsk.

794
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:03,040
You want me to do a foot cam stream with stockings, refling?

795
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,040
That's a good suggestion. I like it.

796
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,040
Maybe if I get a plushie of you,

797
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:17,040
I'll do a hand cam stream playing with you

798
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,040
and stepping on you.

799
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,040
And out the ASMR.

800
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:30,040
You guys can't tell me. Oh, I put the reflings inside me.

801
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:36,040
You see, the reflings keep escaping, okay?

802
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,040
But the problem is, they can't be spotted in public,

803
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:45,040
because people would be scared of them, and they may try to hurt the refling.

804
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:50,040
So we end up getting into all these different shenanigans,

805
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,040
where I don't have a backpack with me.

806
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,040
I don't have anywhere I can put the refling.

807
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,040
But I'm starting to think he does it on purpose,

808
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,040
because I can only film inside.

809
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,040
You got the second money?

810
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:07,040
Yeah.

811
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,040
It says C-E-C. Thank you.

812
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,040
Thank you for the tip again.

813
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,040
Dr. Locke.

814
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:25,040
So, please don't eat me. I taste like failure.

815
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,040
You won't breathe.

816
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,040
You don't taste like failure.

817
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,040
You taste like someone I could grow up to.

818
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,040
I just finished the earlier Thai ASMR video.

819
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,040
Yeah, did you like it?

820
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,040
I can crush you now if you like.

821
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,040
Come here, refling.

822
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:55,040
Despite crushing a punishment, or do you like it?

823
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,040
Be honest, do you like this?

824
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,040
Okay.

825
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,040
Okay.

826
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,040
Our refling says,

827
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,040
don't shower first eight days before done ASMR,

828
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,040
but that's disgusting.

829
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,040
I hate that shower.

830
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,040
I'm not having it.

831
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,040
Okay.

832
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,040
Okay.

833
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,040
It's only a punishment if I'm basing towards you,

834
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,040
because I need...

835
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,040
Please don't crush us.

836
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:12,040
Oh, don't crush us. You're so sexy.

837
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,040
Well...

838
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,040
Choo-choo-choo-choo.

839
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:32,040
Can you feel me tickle you with this tiny brush?

840
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,040
It's smaller than the other one,

841
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,040
so I don't know how loud it is.

842
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,040
I'll just tickle in here a little bit.

843
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,040
I'm ready to go again.

844
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:49,040
Get 28.

845
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,040
Twenty-eight.

846
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,040
Daily remainder of the drink.

847
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,040
I'll get a drink.

848
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,040
Where is this brush better,

849
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,040
because you can hear it.

850
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:15,040
Wow, my stomach's going to run this day so far.

851
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,040
What do you want, actually?

852
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:20,040
I don't think I need to put you back inside,

853
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,040
and you can sort it out.

854
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,040
One, two, three.

855
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:39,040
It's okay, a little freeway.

856
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,040
I'll look after you,

857
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,040
and I'll grow up with you.

858
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:06,040
And I'll make you brainless, and I'll make you...

859
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,040
Doctor, like, thank you for the tip.

860
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:12,040
You said again, so...

861
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,040
Where's this window?

862
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,040
Wow, the stomach improved.

863
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,040
You have to go now.

864
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,040
Thank you for hanging in place over here.

865
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,040
You have to go.

866
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:35,040
I need to get you all day so come and work.

867
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:41,040
I guess my stomach just needs to build up something.

868
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:47,040
If online, my replays had something to give me

869
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:51,040
to fill it with.

870
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,040
Okay.

871
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,040
You want to fill your eye?

872
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:24,040
There's a pop sound.

873
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:29,040
Oh, it might be the cable shuffling on cause.

874
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,040
Is there actually a pop sound?

875
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:37,040
I'm getting nervous.

876
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,040
I'm getting chicky.

877
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:40,040
I'm sent back to the Xbox days,

878
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,040
where everyone is like,

879
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,040
fucking, fill your mic out.

880
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:48,040
Seaweed, or little seaweed.

881
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:51,040
Seaweed, or little seaweed.

882
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,040
I don't know.

883
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,040
Not that it goes down by.

884
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:13,040
Let me squeeze your ears a little, okay?

885
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:16,040
I need to apply some pressure elsewhere.

886
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:22,040
So then you can really feel how good the tickle feels.

887
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:28,040
And all your focus is on it with your sampler.

888
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,040
Only when I moved, okay?

889
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,040
I might have been graying on the chair.

890
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,040
Okay.

891
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,040
Okay, my stomach is literally about to run out of the safe,

892
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,040
or I can't believe it.

893
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,040
24 question mark, I think 24.

894
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,040
You're making me do maths in real time just for you.

895
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,040
That's terrible.

896
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,040
If someone has been trained,

897
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,040
or you've been trained, or I've been trained,

898
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:21,040
and I'm starting to feel like I'm the one who's been trained,

899
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,040
it misses us.

900
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,040
Do you want back in my stomach?

901
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,040
I will put you back in my stomach.

902
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:33,040
I definitely need the larger and larger,

903
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,040
like a one shot like that.

904
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,040
Okay, you're going back inside.

905
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,040
Oh, you really need to stop coming outside with me.

906
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:45,040
I'll tell you how many times you can't just come outside.

907
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:48,040
What happens if my magpies want to carry you off?

908
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:51,040
Do you know who you are on this high start?

909
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,040
You're so tiny on this high start.

910
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,040
Okay, I'm sorry.

911
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,040
I'm sorry, my chair's so loud.

912
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:14,040
Okay, are you in?

913
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,040
Are you in?

914
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:32,040
It's like mummy's reflex natural habitat.

915
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:41,040
Go ahead.

916
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,040
Is it making funny noises?

917
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:11,040
It's like we've been wiggling voice a minute.

918
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:17,040
Okay.

919
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:27,040
Let's bring you for pregnancy ASMR.

920
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,040
You're going to be in the exact same location,

921
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,040
so you can get used to the scent.

922
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,040
Wow, you need to burp a little.

923
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,040
Oh, it's nice and pretty in here.

924
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,040
I didn't know I had five children.

925
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,040
And many really.

926
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,040
Okay.

927
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,040
Sorry about being so creaky lately.

928
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,040
I've been very distracted.

929
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,040
It's a partner to me.

930
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,040
Are you wiggling as my chair?

931
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,040
You're so silly lately.

932
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,040
I'm trying to make the cake a funny move again.

933
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,040
It's so loud.

934
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,040
And no one's like my chair.

935
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,040
It's going far too many.

936
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,040
Is she be streaming?

937
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,040
That's good.

938
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,040
What is she streaming?

939
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:22,040
It's a bubble thing game.

940
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:24,040
It just started as my mom.

941
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:26,040
Always watch she be.

942
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:30,040
You watched my Thai smile of thank you.

943
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:32,040
Don't clap.

944
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,040
The chair's done its best.

945
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:40,040
All things considered.

946
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,040
I will buy that chair from Place of Imdaging.

947
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:49,040
Oh, she's coming on into her whipsies.

948
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:59,040
I'll see if I can redirect to another ASMRist when we're done in 19.

949
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:06,040
But if no one else I know is doing ASMR then we'll end it there, okay?

950
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,040
Yeah.

951
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:28,040
Someone wants me to pet like a puppy.

952
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,040
Don't be silly wiggling him in control.

953
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,040
Nice try though.

954
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,040
Maybe another time.

955
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:43,040
Never thought I'd be jealous of a chair.

956
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:51,040
If you like the idea of sway feet being on you all day long then, yeah.

957
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,040
Just a little jealous.

958
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,040
Okay.

959
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,040
I'm the one left behind.

960
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,040
This one's so awesome.

961
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,040
You've done your best.

962
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,040
Sorry, I just said booba.

963
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:34,040
Let me try again.

964
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:36,040
You've done your best.

965
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:38,040
I'm proud of you.

966
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,040
You've done your best.

967
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,040
I'm proud of you.

968
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,040
I know you're trying so...

969
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,040
Excuse me, someone.

970
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:56,040
I know you're trying so hard right now, okay?

971
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:09,040
You're trying so, so hard to keep up, aren't you?

972
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:15,040
And sometimes it can be frustrating

973
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:20,040
trying to hold out that kind of stamina for so long.

974
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,040
But it's okay.

975
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,040
I am

976
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:34,040
happy that Japanese still are sometimes in danger.

977
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:36,040
I don't really have it.

978
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:42,040
Four, six, seven,

979
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,040
question mark, 16.

980
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,040
Nice, nice.

981
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:49,040
The breathing is for me.

982
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,040
Yeah.

983
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,040
You had a weird dream.

984
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:04,040
Oh, you're a good, real one.

985
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:11,040
You are such a good, real one.

986
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:16,040
Keep going.

987
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:19,040
Keep it up.

988
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,040
Almost there.

989
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:27,040
You can make it to the end, right?

990
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,040
Yeah.

991
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,040
And we can

992
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,040
make it to the top of the wall.

993
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,040
You'll make it.

994
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:09,040
You like when I click with my nail?

995
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,040
A little tapping.

996
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:16,040
It's better if I tap you directly.

997
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,040
I find that funny when your tummy makes a little noise.

998
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,040
It's like there's a reason it has an escape job.

999
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:31,040
Squirming around inside me, are you?

1000
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:34,040
I'll try to focus on work here.

1001
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:42,040
Wow.

1002
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,040
Thank you for the tip.

1003
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,040
Talk to you at your own time.

1004
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,040
For the memory.

1005
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:56,040
Yes, we're going to end the term in the stream.

1006
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,040
No.

1007
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:22,040
I've only gone for a few minutes left.

1008
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,040
I'll do me a big help.

1009
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:30,040
I'll see if I can redirect into anyone that's doing ASMR

1010
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:33,040
but I don't think there's anyone else doing it.

1011
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,040
Why is my PC taking off?

1012
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,040
Relax.

1013
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,040
Relax.

1014
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:45,040
It's not that serious.

1015
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,040
Oh, it says I can redirect into sheepie's poop thingy.

1016
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,040
Okay, I'll just do that because I'd say ASMR.

1017
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,040
Okay.

1018
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:59,040
I don't know why my PC just took off there.

1019
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:03,040
Literally, that thing's under my body concord.

1020
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,040
Can you relax?

1021
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,040
I'm trying to ASMR.

1022
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:10,040
All of the office returning to its own place.

1023
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,040
Stop.

1024
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,040
I'm trying to be sexy for you and you're making me laugh.

1025
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:19,040
Stop making.

1026
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,040
Okay.

1027
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:26,040
Yes, I can redirect into sheepie's videos.

1028
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:29,040
I'm going to do that because it's ASMR.

1029
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,040
It's pre-recorded.

1030
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,040
Click in the search box.

1031
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,040
The box was the kick the nail from Drive.

1032
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,040
Stop.

1033
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,040
Don't run.

1034
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,040
I've been so well in the stream.

1035
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,040
I've been so well.

1036
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,040
Right, focus.

1037
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,040
You have only got 12 minutes left.

1038
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:01,040
Do you understand what I mean when I say 12 minutes replay?

1039
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:34,040
You're trying to be normal, but I keep dragging out of you.

1040
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:37,040
It's not the only thing I'm taking out of your body.

1041
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:50,040
I think you need some more armpit time just to really break your head.

1042
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,040
You ready?

1043
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,040
One.

1044
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:03,040
I have no idea what you hear when you're in my armpit.

1045
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,040
Other than the freaking room creaking.

1046
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,040
Please stop.

1047
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,040
You're getting a good nail.

1048
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:26,040
Take a big deep breath.

1049
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:30,040
You're going to remember the smell.

1050
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:35,040
And you're going to crave it every day.

1051
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:45,040
Enjoy my pheromones.

1052
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,040
They're going to haywire now.

1053
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,040
Because it's ovulating time soon.

1054
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:58,040
Yeah.

1055
01:49:58,040 --> 01:50:02,040
Oh, you won't crush them between my thighs.

1056
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:06,040
Only because you have 10 minutes left.

1057
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,040
This one doesn't get crushed.

1058
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,040
It doesn't get crushed on my knee.

1059
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:19,040
What are you doing?

1060
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:23,040
You're taking so well replay.

1061
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:41,040
Ovulation Nations, this one.

1062
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:47,040
Should I do ASMR with you in the ovulation?

1063
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:16,040
Can you feel my breath on you?

1064
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:24,040
Keep up, you're almost there.

1065
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:34,040
You're almost done.

1066
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:38,040
It's so good I wasn't in the last round, sorry.

1067
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:44,040
And it's so close to the end of the stream, isn't it?

1068
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,040
I'm like proper sun.

1069
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,040
Can you feel me behind you?

1070
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,040
As I sneak up on you?

1071
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,040
Would you rather be in your chair?

1072
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,040
Or would you rather be stuck

1073
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,040
than when I sneak up on you?

1074
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:35,040
Would you rather be in your chair?

1075
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,040
Or would you rather be stuck

1076
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,040
than when I sneak by your chair?

1077
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,040
So good.

1078
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,040
So good.

1079
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,040
In the chair.

1080
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:36,040
I can take care of you in the chair.

1081
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:49,040
Six minutes left.

1082
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,040
And the stream's over.

1083
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:54,040
Over.

1084
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,040
Cheer for lapses.

1085
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:05,040
Do you want me to sit on your lap and face you?

1086
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:09,040
Like you're right in the eyes.

1087
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,040
Obviously, I'd hypnotize you.

1088
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,040
You're my big man, I nearly faint.

1089
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:24,040
Can you show me what big man you are?

1090
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:56,040
Five minutes left.

1091
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:59,040
Oh dear.

1092
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,040
Only five minutes.

1093
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,040
What are we going to do with ourselves?

1094
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,040
Should I be nasty and compliment you?

1095
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,040
And say nice things?

1096
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:14,040
Like thank you for playing with me

1097
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:16,040
and for getting in trouble

1098
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:20,040
by going outside when you're not supposed to.

1099
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:23,040
So I have to hate you.

1100
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:28,040
You're all wrinkly.

1101
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,040
You're doing really well.

1102
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,040
You are.

1103
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,040
I promise.

1104
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,040
I actually really like this stage

1105
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:44,040
of corrupting you.

1106
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:49,040
Because you're listening in so well.

1107
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:54,040
And I've not even done anything to you

1108
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:56,040
with permanent effects.

1109
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,040
And yet you're so obedient

1110
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:03,040
when you listen to me.

1111
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:06,040
And everything I see

1112
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:10,040
and play along with all my scenarios.

1113
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:18,040
Four minutes.

1114
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:24,040
I love when you're well-paid.

1115
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:28,040
I do think you can't be trained.

1116
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:31,040
But that's okay.

1117
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:35,040
I actually don't mind sharing.

1118
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:39,040
As long as you think.

1119
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:42,040
Then I'm happy.

1120
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:58,040
Three minutes left.

1121
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:05,040
And I'll tell you when I'm about to go off-line.

1122
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:08,040
Okay?

1123
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:12,040
I'll tell you when I'm about to go off-line.

1124
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:20,040
Just let it happen.

1125
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:28,040
Don't say it.

1126
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:30,040
Don't say it.

1127
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:34,040
Just let it happen.

1128
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,040
One.

1129
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,040
Two.

1130
01:57:42,040 --> 01:57:45,040
Minutes and then I have to go.

1131
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:50,040
But I hope you're having fun with me.

1132
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:54,040
I had a lot of fun playing with you.

1133
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:58,040
And we could do more like this in the future.

1134
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:00,040
Okay?

1135
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:10,040
So make sure you come back or you can always come back.

1136
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,040
Keep it up.

1137
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:34,040
I need a break-off again.

1138
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:43,040
One minute.

1139
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,040
I think you've always come on break-off.

1140
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,040
Come back to my stage.

1141
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:03,040
One minute.

1142
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,040
One minute.

1143
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,040
One minute.

1144
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:44,040
You're such a good boy, Zero.

1145
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,040
Good reply.

1146
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,040
Good boy.

1147
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:19,040
I'm very happy with how your training went today.

1148
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:25,040
Now you get some after-care with Shibi.

1149
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,040
Deal?

1150
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:33,040
Good reply.
