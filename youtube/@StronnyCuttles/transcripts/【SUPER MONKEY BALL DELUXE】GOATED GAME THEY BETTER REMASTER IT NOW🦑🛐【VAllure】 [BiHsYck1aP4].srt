1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
Hello? Hello? No, it's so cute. What was her name again? Straw something? It's been a

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:36,720
long time. I think we're about to be up. I have turned down the background so much. Who

3
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:44,480
was it again? I don't remember but I know she doesn't hate us. She's my darling Rieflin.

4
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
It's going to be a very strange stream because I'm on the left side for once but it's because

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,800
the map is bottom right and I don't want to intrude. Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon.

6
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm a little honey bun. Today we are not getting educated and the reason we're not getting educated

7
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:24,320
is because five hours ago I opened up my document to make the presentation for the stream. I typed

8
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,120
in how do we make bridges and my head almost exploded and I was like hmm this education

9
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,480
stream is not going to work out so it's just getting completely replaced. I kept delaying it.

10
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,160
I kept delaying it. I was like I just need one more day to sit down and get all the information.

11
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,520
One more day I'll gather the information. One more day. No, it's getting squashed. Now we're not

12
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,760
doing that education stream. I'll talk about my special interests and stuff that I want to educate

13
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,320
you in on another stream but the uh however bridges built and why the onions make its

14
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,440
prime when we cut into them. No, it's still happening. It's still happening. It's still

15
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,400
happening, son. Right. I have a very important clip you all need to see.

16
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,120
So I'm gonna peel back the curtains just like I'm gonna peel back your foreskin this afternoon

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,240
when I take those pictures. Um the girls so what happens is you clip the girls and then the girls

18
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:28,560
can see those clips and they send them to me okay and I go get them edited. AC sent me the most

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,880
redonkillous moment I think I've ever seen occur on a stream and I'm literally gonna send it to you

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,640
because I was creasing in my little gamer chair at this freaking clip that someone did of our

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,200
like midstream hours he horned so we're all gonna watch at the same time right click that and then

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,120
click pause whatever don't hit play yeah I'll tell you when to hit play we'll say three two one play

23
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,320
okay and we can just laugh at the ridiculousness what occurred on this stream I literally said to

24
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,080
AC I'm he horned right he's ready three two one go

25
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:19,840
oh

26
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,640
why was any of that in your stream it was just so fucking random

27
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:44,400
oh I didn't expect that and it's the affliction in her voice as well

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,760
oh my god like I just like when I go like when the girls submit clips you know sometimes it's

29
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,640
like a funny ha ha moment some of the clips you know can't be turned into a short just one reason

30
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,560
or another and obviously that's not getting turned into a short but I was absolutely he horned

31
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:18,560
over it I was just the way she was that's just the next back to but yeah AC got the drip rip

32
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:30,320
I assume right we're gonna see how this game goes ready ready so this is a tutorial

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:42,960
why is that not register nothing okay there we go sorry uh yeah the memory card real and true

34
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,920
yep memory card this is uh the hardware yep that's me spanking the hardware this is real

35
00:04:47,920 --> 00:05:00,000
so super monkey ball deluxe was a game that came out on xbox original many moons ago

36
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
um strutting you need to make noises like that

37
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,720
sounds like a chameleon um hi mommy how are you uh I'm very tired but I'm very happy to play this

uh fish it is yep already

43
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,560

44
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,040
oh we have campaign oh my god look at those pixels there's three of them

45

return to monkey what have I seen I don't fucking recall any of this

66
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:25,680
so this game is literally this like this is it it's like a tilt tilted thing

67
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,160
and then you just go through the bull you can collect the bananas if you want but

68
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,640
I've no idea but like they even have an action new place so yeah this is the game um I remember

69
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,880
I don't know what I remember I don't remember much to be honest I'm kind of sunlocked right now I

74
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:23,920
uh I hope no I'm trying to wake up I'm exhausted

75
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:34,240
it's so obvious I'm sorry I'm exhausted I don't want to worry anyone but I'm fucking exhaustive

76
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
um I didn't sleep well I've been having really bad sleep I've been

77
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:49,680
just being a wee warrior as always um this game will wake you up I can hardly commentate right now

78
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,480
um I'm going to do a cheeky two hour stream then we're going to redirect into sheepsters we always

79
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:04,000
worry about you no no it just so I went sorry I'm going to drink my tea sorry sorry pause the

80
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,520
absolute 10 out of 10 gameplay um just if you get bored just look at the little monkey dancing on

81
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:18,800
the screen look I'm go hey hey go go go um but yes unfortunately I'm extremely tired I'm emotionally

82
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:27,520
exhausted um I did a lot of background work only there was not one thing to show any of

83
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,360
of it yesterday I think that's probably the worst thing about delayed gratification when it comes

84
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:41,920
to work is I can do so much in the background and there is nothing to show for it for weeks or

85
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,080
months or days away type thing and it's a it's a wee bit soul crushing just a wee bit

86
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,760
just a wee bit but that's okay um but the girls are going to get loads of shorts soon

87
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,520
um I've sent away the next batch uh I'm going to start sending away their emote batches um I spoke

88
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,280
to sheepsters if you didn't know sheepsters um model actually looks like her now oh my god five

89
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:12,480
head moment um I did say to her uh I'm very sorry but it's going to take a hot second before we can

90
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,480
change your emotes to look and reflect like you that's not a sentence but try again delayed

91
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,320
gratification is that a reference to the hit game balutroll actually it's okay we know you've

92
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,440
been a good girl even if it's in the background well so I had a sleep for five hours um if that

93
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,880
but I've been having a really light sleep so I don't even wake up feeling refreshed and Jimmy

94
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:46,160
Beezus at 28.6k oh my god two months and finally someone at vealer got a fucking viral shot it took

95
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,320
long enough um I'm so happy for Emmy I'm so bloody happy for Emmy um she's actually recorded

96
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,360
two three more um that I think I'll do rather well one in particular you guys are gonna love

97
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,880
because I loved it um but I'm so happy that someone finally got a viral shot it took long enough

98
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,280
um it's so hard to figure out what the algorithm wants in that very moment but Emmy managed to

99
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,680
hit it so fucking hats off to Emmy or Jimmy Beezus you like to call her for some reason um

100
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,680
a I want to give you lots of hugs and pamper you well the plan of action is I want to play

101
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,240
super monkey balda luxe for two hours okay I'm gonna go for a nap I'm then coming back on with

102
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,480
Arissa and she's my fantastic shorts editor and she's absolutely lovely it'll be the first time

103
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,960
we've talked and interacted but you know when you know when you meet someone and you're just like

104
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:52,240
both the years are on the same wavelength that's exactly what I get from Arissa um

105
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,440
and I adore her already and I've literally never even heard her voice in a voice call yet

106
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,960
um it's very nice when you kind of come across these people um where it's just like both the

107
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,600
years are on the same wavelength you get it you're both mature you know what's up like it's just really

108
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:20,320
never meet your clippers no Arissa's lovely to work with she's fantastic two kindred spirits

109
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,120
it honestly I don't know I will find out after the freaking collab I'll be like no I don't like

110
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,440
Arissa you're fired because we couldn't pivot the furniture in this one game it two great

111
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,280
friends excited to talk for the first time it's very nice um can't wait for vermin tide two yes

112
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,960
vermin tide two is happening tomorrow 100% I'm not swapping it out um I just need to

113
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,560
basically my job is after I've pushed the foes of my derriere is quite literally I'm brushing up

114
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,760
on vermin tide two to make sure I don't embarrass myself in our group session together um it's

115
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,480
Arissa of each of her Arissa is going to be day beautying at a later date we will do a watch

116
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,280
along when she does because I adore her and I want to give her all the kisses in the world um

117
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,320
but at the moment no I don't know she's not actively being a pngtuber at the moment as she was

118
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:26,000
but then um she'd rather debut and then put her all her effort into streaming rather than being

119
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,040
split right now between like should I do png tubing should I do this should I do that uh no

120
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,040
she is a bit split and um I have to commend her for being able to analyze content like that because

121
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,280
she is she's right in her decision sorry sorry to be sorry to be an analyzer of content for a

122
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,840
moment but um no she is right if you know if you're in the stages of getting a model but you don't

123
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:54,720
want to you know stretch your time to thin will Arissa be debut and undervealer no she's Arissa

124
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,080
no she's Arissa um she's analizing Arissa replays and carry environment type as long as the game

125
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:11,200
doesn't crash mid-round I hope not I don't I don't see why it would Arissa for gen 4 gen 1.1

126
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,680
someone asked that I don't know if it was a website inquiry recently or something it was like

127
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:26,320
um I'm aware that you want three gens I was basically asking for a spin-off gen if they

128
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,520
didn't get in at any point and I and I was like I can't I can't do anything with this I can't reply

129
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:38,960
to this I was like no there's no spin-off gen I'm Rizzler Arissa yes the ballgame yes ballgame

lack of sleep is catching up to me oh well I woke up a 15 minutes before my alarm so that's a lot

it's starting to play with falls tonight I sure hope so a little refland okay I'm gonna turn it down

180
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,960
even more wait I don't know what they did so I have no expectations I want to play the orc game

181
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,960
I said it I said it we're gonna play it we're gonna play the orc game something about massage

182
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,920
in an orc or something but it turns out the orc you know it's a chick and she has an attachment

183
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,400
I don't care I don't care if it's controversial we're playing that game I have an interest in it

184
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,280
no not a bum on the orc game isn't it not like it's a chick but she has an

185
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:18,560
attachment or am I going mental orc or orc orc orc orc orc orc orc orc is that sound really

186
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,120
similar does it sound like I'm barking at you right now I thought you said orc no the orc game

187
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,120
I don't know I have no clue what game you're talking about well we're just gonna have to find out

188
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,240
together then the orc is the wait what I thought it was a chick and she had an attachment

189
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,880
meh I'm sure I'm gonna throw that game in the bin what the fuck I thought it was a chick with the

190
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,920
are you there she's obviously saying orc no the orc is wait what maybe it's a mod

191
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,680
I mean

192
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,480
or am I supposed to role play while I do it and then that's what that feels I'm

193
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:11,760
going about to sneeze in my tea okay there we go oh Markiplier played it what the what isn't it

194
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,280
wait wait hold on a minute isn't orc massage literally about

195
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:29,760
am I going mental isn't it not a chick I'm going mental I must be violently remembering

196
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,960
are we talking about Mordor uh yeah yeah yeah okay let me finish last sip

197
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:45,440
that's after the massage what he could get away with it because he was a bigger youtube

198
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,240
Markiplier a freak okay right let's get rolloid into the juicy gameplay that's right this gameplay

199
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:03,680
you are on you are gripping the edge of your seat who goes there um you're gripping the edge of your

200
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,800
seat oh my god Mercy could not play this game she'd already be violently motion sick

201
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:18,400
that was bad I don't have motion sickness but we're basically gonna go as hard as we possibly can

202
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:24,640
I don't know how far we're gonna get we seem to be in world one I have no idea how many worlds

203
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:32,800
there are but um on the topic of barely allowed games heard of only cans Thursday it's free and

204
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:43,200
quite a trip is it bannable or is it playable oh my god we're claptrap oh my god wait it actually

205
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,960
is a map where you have to go up and I was looking to see if I can find some endurance streamers that

206
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:57,040
would play oh why aren't you moving bro go up okay there we go um I was gonna see if I can find some

207
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:07,200
endurance streamers that would play uh Borderlands 2 with me um now I might be able to convince

208
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,840
she be to play it but it's it's a bit the the problem is is if I don't want to start it and then

209
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,840
we don't complete it but I don't want to bum rush the campaign either and I'm like did I just play

210
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,600
the reflands and we just played the Borderlands 2 campaign and because we I mean I could make it

211
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,640
happen to be honest once the the throw away steam account is made I can pretty much do anything I

212
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:46,640
want with you I mean that's the end goal baby but um yeah the entirety of Borderlands 2 I think

213
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,920
it'd be hard to change people out that's the thing I could do like maybe two hour sessions

214
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,880
and then after the two hour mark we swap to the next but then if your character is a low level

215
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,080
oh I don't think that would work that was a quick one you can already do whatever you want with me

216
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:17,360
um starting BL and not finishing it is a very funny thing yes I in particular don't really like

217
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:27,280
doing that so I do want um to finalize it if that means you know putting out a tweet and being like

218
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:35,280
hey I'm looking for endurance streamers um it might have to be she be can do insurance endurance but

219
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,880
I think it might also be good if the VTubers also played the game before so then it's also a

220
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,280
nostalgia pretty much a nostalgia for everyone across the board you know I'm yours to use as you

221
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:57,520
wish two hour sessions with my man I couldn't last two hours borderlands 3 has level scaling so

222
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:04,960
dropping out works much better oh maybe we'll play borderlands 3 together why do you need to do

223
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,800
antenna recession no I'm not gonna ask VTubers to do antenna recessions what I don't want is to

224
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,440
pick up borderlands 2 only to for it to be impossible for us to all come together again

225
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:26,400
and finish it I don't want to start borderlands 2 and be unable to finish it okay this game has a

226
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,160
remake this game was already remade

227
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,560

324
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,280
and it worked okay I can't hear it because this game is actually so loud it's destroyed my headset

349
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,160
what that button didn't stop it

350
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,720
what it slowed this one down though

351
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,200
it slowed this one down

352
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:52,800
okay okay okay don't write me yet don't write me yet come on come on

353

00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,040
oh my god wait we're actually progressing through the campaign

355
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,920

356
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,280
this is a bumble eating doctor that bumble is going to use this volcano to blow everything up

357
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,800

378
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:29,360

in in case it's like old media and it's like just full of viruses I'm sure

440
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,720
another ring sonic hero surely if I just send it I'll be fine

441
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,920
oh I mean it worked

442
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,880
I mean it worked I ain't complaining

443
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,360
yay

444
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,680
I love that stream so much

445
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,480
I don't think I have the the ability to even successfully do this run

446
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,480
just send it speedrun queen oh thank you thank you I've been here all week

447
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:38,640
dizzy uh so I just follow the curve

448
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,600
following the curve oh oh yeah mr perp way I've got a burp sorry I burped

449
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:53,040
okay gently gently easy easy easy easy edge it edge it nope edge it right we're good

450
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,840
good good good good good how many like level worlds are there infotations marks I'm

451
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,320
literally about to finish the campaign mode by accident I don't think I want to

452
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,840
what is even this I'm not supposed to do all of these in 60 seconds

453
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:20,320
wait that underpass bridge I'm no no way I'm doing that give it the old twisting spin

454
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,240
Am I allowed to twist and spin mirrors?

455
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,040
This one is my queen tip for the world, milledius.

456
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,040
You were there.

457
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,040
Send it, send it, send it!

458
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,040
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

459
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,040
No, no, no, I don't, I refuse, I refuse.

460
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,040
I'm gonna send it a little to the right, okay?

461
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,040
I'm sending it a little to the right.

462
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,040
I'm sending it a little to the right.

463
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,040
Okay, that was a terrible choice!

464
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,040
Okay, right, okay, what does it mean?

465
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:05,040
Can I, in theory, wait until it groups together to move again?

466
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,040
So do that, and then it moves, right, and then we'll slow down.

467
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,040
Oh, no, it's moving me about.

468
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,040
That's alright, that's alright, no, it's alright, it's alright.

469
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,040
Oh, alright, no, that's fine, then we'll move a little bit.

470
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Okay, okay, okay, easy, no!

471
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,040
Okay, hmm, I think maybe we just send it.

472
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,040
This is as far as we got as we sent it on the very fourth time.

473
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,040
A little to the right to hit people.

474
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,040
How dare you, that's mine too!

475
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,040
Right, we're just throwing it, I'm just throwing myself at the goal.

476
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:37,040
Okay, okay, let me try another one, let me try a different one.

477
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
I think we can do this.

478
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Come on, come on, come on, come on, give me that gadget phone.

479
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,040
It's called downhill.

480
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,040
Surely, all I have to do is tip forward a little bit and do nothing else.

481
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,040
Oh, no, there's blockades!

482
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,040
Oh, no!

483
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:03,040
Wait, it only gave me 30 seconds?

484
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,040
It only gives me 30 seconds to do this one?

485
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,040
Right, get back up there, sorry.

486
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,040
Why would you only give me 30 seconds?

487
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,040
Well, this was our Wien's game, what's going on here?

488
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,040
I've got to understand the laws of physics and speed and...

489
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,040
If you're playing Super Monkey Ball Deluxe and you're going 100 miles an hour on this map,

490
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,040
how long does it take you to reach the goal?

491
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,040
Gotta go fast.

492
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,040
Johnny tried to implement herself into my memories by playing all my nostalgia games.

493
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:49,040
You've discovered what that stuff, what is this?

494
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,040
We're doing it.

495
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,040
It looks like a Rubik's Cube of a map.

496
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,040
And we have 60 seconds to do this.

497
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,040
Right, we're going to cheat.

498
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,040
I think we can do this.

499
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah, okay, now what?

500
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
Huh?

501
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
What's going on here?

502
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,040
I don't know.

503
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,040
What?

504
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Whoa, wait, I'm so sorry, I don't really know where I'm heading.

505
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,040
I've run the corner?

506
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,040
Right, okay.

507
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,040
Can I just like throw myself off the whole thing?

508
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,040
Oh no, this is the end of it, hold on.

509
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,040
Hold on, this is a rather quirky map, I have to admit.

510
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,040
Oh no, he's going to give me a countdown.

511
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,040
No, don't tell me to hurry up, I'm scared.

512
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,040
Stop, you're making me scared!

513
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,040
Right, okay, okay, we can throw ourselves a little bit off.

514
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,040
Let's try that again.

515
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,040
Keep going down, hey, hey, but actually go down.

516
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,040
No, like throw, throw, actually go down, girl.

517
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,040
Okay, let's just speedrun this section.

518
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,040
I sped run too much!

519
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,040
I sped run too much!

520
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,040
I sped run too much!

521
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,040
Okay, we will do a controlled fall.

522
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,040
We will do a controlled fall.

523
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Let's be mindful of how our speed, okay?

524
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,040
Okay, we're going to go back to zero, and we're going to throw.

525
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,040
And then gently, okay?

526
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,040
Oh no, why did you do that?

527
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,040
Mr. Ma, what?

528
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,040
How?

529
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,040
No even, why?

530
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,040
No even, like, when, but how?

531
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,040
Right, let's try again.

532
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,040
Right, slow it down.

533
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,040
Okay, let's try again.

534
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,040
Right, let's try again.

535
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,040
Right, slow it down, right?

536
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,040
And then send it a little bit, right?

537
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,040
And then bonk.

538
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,040
Right, there you go, there you go.

539
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,040
No, no, now you've gone the wrong way, mate.

540
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,040
Hold on.

541
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,040
Look, I've got a speedrun to beat.

542
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,040
Right, just because you didn't want to beat it.

543
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,040
Doesn't mean I didn't.

544
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,040
Right, let's not go flying off the map either.

545
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,040
Okay, because I flew off the map last time.

546
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,040
Don't get excited just because there's bananas.

547
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,040
Easy, right, and then it's here, surely?

548
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,040
Oh, we actually did it!

549
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,040
Oh my god, we did it, we're so smart.

550
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
Will she drop this game midway as well?

551
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,040
Relax!

552
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,040
I'm like, I could get 100% the damn thing.

553
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,040
Fucking steady, I'm getting insulted here.

554
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,040
Let's just try Maby.

555
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,040
Let's just try Maby, okay?

556
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:46,040
Under, oh my god, junction?

557
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:52,040
Monkey screaming in pain as Mummy tries speedrunnin', honestly.

558
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,040
Wait, I can go backwards?

559
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,040
I saw that, why can't I go backwards?

560
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Easy.

561
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,040
Easy.

562
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:16,040
Gently, gently apply gentle pressure to your objective!

563
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:20,040
Objective, objective, objective.

564
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,040
Why did I say objection?

565
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,040
That word.

566
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,040
I think that was everything.

567
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,040
I think we're about to get a cutscene.

568
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,040
Actually doing it, question mark.

569
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,040
Oh!

570
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
What the fuck?

571
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,040
Right, hydration check, darling.

572
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,040
It's been ever since I came in here.

573
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,040
Those monkeys must have given up by now.

574
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,040
Oh, my, I'm giving up by now.

575
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,040
I'll head for my hideout to plan my revenge.

576
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,040
A hee hee hee.

577
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,040
Oh my god, he a frog.

578
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,040
Frog dance.

579
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,040
We finally found...

580
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,040
Give us back our bananas!

581
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,040
Oh my god, it's Ash.

582
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,040
You're still here.

583
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,040
I can't believe it.

584
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:10,040
What do I have to do to get you monkeys off my back?

585
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,040
Oh well, it's time I bid thee adieu.

586
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,040
Bye now!

587
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,040
So long, everyone.

588
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,040
Hee hee hee hee hee.

589
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,040
Dr. Bad Boon, I'll get you.

590
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,040
Wait, are we going further?

591
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,040
And her east attorney kick over?

592
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:41,040
I can't breathe.

593
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,040
I think I'm gonna die.

594
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,040
Sheenette.

595
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,040
My head is almost out and I'm only halfway there.

596
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,040
Wheeze.

597
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,040
Sorry.

598
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,040
Why are you so tired?

599
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,040
Anyway, it's time to give up.

600
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,040
You can't get away from us.

601
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,040
Hee hee.

602
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,040
I got you.

603
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,040
Look out behind you.

604
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,040
Behind you.

605
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,040
Come on, Dr. Bad Boon.

606
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,040
I'm not gonna fall for that trick.

607
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:20,040
You're planning on running as soon as I turn my back, aren't you?

608
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
Huh?

609
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,040
Hee.

610
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,040
Hee.

611
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,040
Oh my.

612
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,040
Wah!

613
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,040
I think I whipped myself.

614
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,040
Oh it's AC.

615
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,040
Oh hello.

616
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,040
Oh boy, it's too late now.

617
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,040
Hang on everyone!

618
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,040
Bob's joining Swallowinners tomorrow?

619
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
You mean today?

620
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,040
I think we're in...

621
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,040
Wait, it swallowed buildings?

622
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,040
We're gonna have to stay here for the rest of my life.

623
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,040
But on the bright side, it may be a good thing

624
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,040
since I'll be staying with my sweet Mimi.

625
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,040
Ew, I can't stand this.

626
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,040
Let me out, get me out of here.

627
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,040
Get me out of here, no!

628
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,040
Don't worry, we've got a way to escape.

629
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,040
All of us except for Dr. Bad Boon, that is.

630
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,040
We are starving.

631
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,040
Let us cooperate.

632
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,040
I love that, let us cooperate.

633
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,040
I just love the sentence, let us cooperate.

634
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,040
Okay, let us cooperate.

635
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,040
Any cooperators?

636
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,040
Oh!

637
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,040
Excuse me?

638
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,040
The goalpost is moving, literally in game.

639
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,040
No!

640
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,040
What does this do?

641
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,040
That was a shite job at that one.

642
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,040
Have I reset some?

643
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,040
Okay.

644
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,040
Alright, hold on.

645
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,040
Let me get on you.

646
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,040
Let me get on you.

647
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,040
Alright, let me get on you.

648
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,040
Wait, are you serious?

649
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,040
Can I honestly not do this?

650
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,040
Sorry, the camera angle is very hard to manipulate.

651
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,040
Wait, can I actually...

652
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,040
Bra!

653
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,040
It's an inch!

654
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,040
It's literally one inch!

655
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,040
Are you serious right now?

656
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,040
One inch!

657
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,040
One inch!

658
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,040
What am I supposed to do?

659
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,040
I'm...

660
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,040
Bra!

661
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,040
It's one inch!

662
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,040
How am I supposed to do anything with that?

663
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:13,040
No way!

664
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
No way.

665
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:22,040
Okay, so I have to perfectly...

666
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040
Time out.

667
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,040
What the heck?

668
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,040
Right, one...

669
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,040
Two...

670
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,040
Three?

671
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,040
Right, I was far too early.

672
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,040
What the heck?

673
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,040
It's literally in the air.

674
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,040
One inch isn't enough to you.

675
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,040
Alright, hold on.

676
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,040
One, two, three!

677
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
No!

678
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,040
Far too early.

679
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,040
Wait, we're not doing this one.

680
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,040
Bra!

681
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,040
One...

682
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,040
Two?

683
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,040
I don't know.

684
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,040
No, it's not gonna make it.

685
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,040
It's so hard to control the freaking camera angle.

686
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,040
I'm so sorry.

687
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,040
Ah, I'm too early!

688
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,040
It's not even visible.

689
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:14,040
Should I just fucking go for this one, honestly?

690
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
I'm trying.

691
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,040
I'm gonna stay right here.

692
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,040
I've got a banana though.

693
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,040
Okay, we'll do a different one.

694
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,040
This is impossible.

695
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,040
It's one inch.

696
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,040
How am I supposed to do something with that?

697
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,040
Well, how the tables turn.

698
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:31,040
Size doesn't matter, she says.

699
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,040
How dare you.

700
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,040
One inch.

701
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,040
How am I supposed to do anything with that?

702
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Did I just do SPH by accident?

703
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,040
What?

704
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:45,040
We've done block slim before.

705
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,040
We've done that.

706
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,040
We can do that.

707
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,040
Let us cooperate.

708
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,040
Cooperate with you.

709
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,040
Give Stroney an inch.

710
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,040
E E per star.

711
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,040
That's what the game is like.

712
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,040
Hi.

713
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,040
We're almost at the goal.

714
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,040
Every goal is a goal.

715
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,040
Wait, hold on.

716
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,040
One way around.

717
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,040
Every goal is a goal.

718
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,040
Okay, at least we've got one in here.

719
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,040
You saw it here, Chet.

720
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,040
She made one inch of work.

721
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,040
You need some momentum.

722
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Literally, I couldn't even get on it.

723
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,040
Wood dammit.

724
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,040
Jump ramp?

725
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,040
This looks so dangerous.

726
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:46,040
The difficulty between the maps is astronomical.

727
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,040
Ready?

728
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,040
I don't know what way I'm supposed to go yet.

729
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,040
I don't know what way I'm supposed to go.

730
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,040
Right, I don't normally get motion sick in games,

731
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,040
but I actually think I might be getting mildly motion sick right now.

732
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,040
Not like me.

733
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,040
Wait a minute.

734
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,040
Who are you?

735
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,040
Suspicious.

736
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,040
I'm like, wait a minute.

737
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,040
Is that motions like this?

738
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:35,040
I don't get motion sick in games.

739
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,040
Mummy, don't throw up, honestly.

740
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,040
Could be your sleep deprived as well.

741
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,040
I might help if you unstretch the stream.

742
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:48,040
You want me to unstretch?

743
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,040
How am I supposed to fit you?

744
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Oh my god.

745
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,040
I don't know how I got away with that one.

746
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,040
I just literally just went for it.

747
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,040
The word she can say is no take to be your build.

748
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,040
He's tighter.

749
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,040
What the beehive?

750
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,040
The bees?

751
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,040
Hi.

752
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,040
Sleep deprivation can give nausea symptoms?

753
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,040
I didn't know that.

754
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:24,040
I am pretty sleep deprived.

755
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,040
Right, wait, how or what am I supposed to do?

756
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,040
Can I just go around the edge?

757
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,040
Get me on that again.

758
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,040
Be a lure, spin off.

759
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,040
Like, vomular, spin off.

760
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
Right, let's just send it, let's just send it.

761
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,040
Oh, not that fast though.

762
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,040
Right, hold on, hold on.

763
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,040
One more time, one more time.

764
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,040
One more time for the guy in the back, okay.

765
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,040
Is this, how much is there more to campaign mode?

766
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,040
If there's like one, like if this is the last level...

767
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,040
Stop!

768
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,040
Oh my god, right, this is getting embarrassing now.

769
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:06,040
Stop it, you call yourself a gamer?

770
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,040
What is this?

771
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,040
I'm about to burp and it's not because I've drank anything.

772
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,040
I'm motion sick, what the fuck?

773
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,040
I never get...

774
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,040
Almost gagged there, hmm.

775
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,040
I don't think we can continue playing.

776
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,040
No, oh, sugar.

777
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,040
I don't know what to do.

778
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,040
We might be reading marshmallows.

779
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,040
I think I might be mildly motion sick right now.

780
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:40,040
What the heck, I don't get motion sick like that though.

781
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,040
Bra.

782
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,040
Come on.

783
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,040
I was like one centimeter off of it.

784
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,040
Oh, right, I keep doing the same thing.

785
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,040
Right, enough, enough, enough, enough.

786
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,040
I think, I think I'm actually gonna have to read marshmallows.

787
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,040
I'm not even kidding.

788
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,040
Yeah, hold on, let me...

789
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,040
I'll be getting all marshmallowed up.

790
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,040
This is when you know it's that's the time, okay?

791
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,040
I'll leave the background game music on.

792
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,040
How about that?

793
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,040
For some ambience.

794
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,040
I'm gonna need a cheeky break though.

795
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,040
I don't feel...

796
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:21,040
Mr. Stark, I don't feel very well.

797
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,040
Mr. Refling, I don't feel very good right now.

798
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,040
I ain't gonna lie.

799
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,040
Hold on, let me open up marshmallow.

800
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,040
I love marshmallow time.

801
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:34,040
I'm gonna be able to read any of these out loud.

802
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:38,040
Hold on, let me just make sure I'm gonna redirect him to sheep's throats.

803
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,040
Sorry, today...

804
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,040
Today I don't feel like doing anything.

805
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,040
Whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle.

806
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,040
Don't feel like blowing up my phone.

807
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,040
So leave a message at the tone.

808
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,040
Today I don't feel like doing anything.

809
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,040
I'm sure she'll be screaming today.

810
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:09,040
I'm like a hundred percent sure her ass is screaming.

811
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,040
No!

812
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,040
It's two hours later than she normally screams.

813
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,040
Right, everyone's getting put in the bin.

814
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,040
Everyone's getting put in the bin.

815
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,040
I've had enough.

816
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,040
I can't believe it.

817
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,040
I can't believe there's fluctuating.

818
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,040
Oh my god, right.

819
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:33,040
To the snowberry that sent me a marshmallow calling me an effing R word.

820
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:44,040
Because for the ASMR train I'm swapping time slots with AC for one stream in a month.

821
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:51,040
Snowberry, for the love of god, do you genuinely think I'm trying to sabotage AC?

822
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:57,040
Please, take a moment to think about the words I communicated in the last stream.

823
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:05,040
I said that the ASMR redirect train does not work for AC because she goes first.

824
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:22,040
So for one stream in the month, I would take her time slot and she would take mine to ensure that she gets a benefit from the redirect train for one stream.

825
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,040
Fucking relax.

826
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,040
That language you used was abysmal.

827
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,040
You really need to think stuff through.

828
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,040
You can't even be doing stuff like that.

829
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:35,040
You need to reflect because that was not on par.

830
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,040
I don't normally give people a spanking but seriously that was a bit too far, that marshmallow.

831
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:46,040
And I think deep down you know that was a bit too far as well because what even was that by any sound of logic.

832
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:56,040
Why do you genuinely think I was going to randomly swap time zones after establishing, for me personally, streaming every single day?

833
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:03,040
Why would I establish a time slot where I'm always online and then I would randomly swap it?

834
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,040
Don't be silly, please use your head and don't be so...

835
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:15,040
Don't act like that because if AC caught wind of what you even sent me in Marshmallow, imagine how she would feel knowing that I got that off of you.

836
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,040
Seriously, use your head.

837
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,040
I don't give spankings often but holy shit.

838
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,040
That was something else.

839
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:28,040
I can't wait to turn your ass into a twinkie tonight, thank you.

840
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,040
I don't think AC would approve of Billy and Mumme.

841
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,040
Shame on that particular snobbery.

842
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:41,040
I don't normally give people a spanking, I just leave it.

843
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:51,040
But because you brought it to my Marshmallows and you definitely said some things that you obviously felt in the moment,

844
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:56,040
and then when you look at reality it's like holy fuck you've literally just spewed all of this against me.

845
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:02,040
When all it was was, hey AC doesn't benefit from this thing, I'm going to swap my...

846
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:06,040
I'm going to go two hours earlier and she's going to take my time slot so she benefits from this thing.

847
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:11,040
And then I get called an array of shit, I'm like holy fucking shit bro, use your brain.

848
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,040
Five seconds, that's all I have.

849
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,040
Anyway, back to the regular scheduled H time, honestly.

850
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,040
Let me move this over so I can read it a bit better.

851
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,040
Sorry if this is a duplicated message, no please don't worry you can always duplicate.

852
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:32,040
As a budget link, I'm happy to say that Reeflings can't afford to support you so much.

853
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,040
You deserve the support you amazing giver.

854
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:38,040
I know you sometimes don't read things out loud that seem personal at least,

855
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,040
I'll just say you can share it in this case.

856
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:45,040
You put it at the end, I already read it, I read it at the start.

857
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,040
If you don't want me to read it you need to put it at the start.

858
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,040
I read it at the end of your message Reeflings.

859
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,040
You miss, you miss.

860
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,040
But yes, thank you.

861
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,040
No, please don't worry you don't have to hand over money.

862
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:07,040
You don't have to actually hand over money, I assure you.

863
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,040
Everything's going good, everything's going well.

864
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,040
I don't have any issues, I don't have any problems.

865
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:16,040
The Veiler Cup program just went up, which I need to deal with shortly.

866
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,040
A paste action on YouTube and I'm like thank you.

867
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,040
Not trying to debate but there's no way I can believe that was a real complaint.

868
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:32,040
Well, I've got the marshmallow approved but unfortunately.

869
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:39,040
I think what it is, obviously as most things are in life, one big misunderstanding.

870
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:46,040
But it was the fact that misunderstanding went so severe to just like straight up name calling,

871
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,040
claiming that I don't want the best for AC and all that jazz and it was like,

872
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:55,040
motherfucker, I was pregnant with her for one year and you think I don't want the best for her?

873
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,040
Like, who do you think gave her that ASMR script?

874
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:03,040
Who do you think edited it? Who do you think put subtitles on it so it would get as much traction as possible?

875
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,040
Like, come on, come on.

876
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:09,040
I don't know what brain worms you guys are fighting over there but holy fuck.

877
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,040
Short your shit out before you start flying shit.

878
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,040
To everyone, I love you all, this is a great place to be.

879
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,040
Maybe PS don't read that.

880
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,040
Hope you're doing okay. Today's my birthday.

881
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:55,040
He's the jolly good fellow, he's the jolly good fellow, he's the jolly good fellow.

882
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,040
That nobody can deny.

883
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,040
Happy birthday.

884
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,040
I love you so much.

885
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,040
I love you too, a little refling.

886
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,040
Thank you for coming back and spending time with us.

887
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,040
As always, Samwise was the secret hero. Feels good man.

888
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:14,040
Hey, Strani, I come to you as a humble refling with a humble request.

889
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,040
Let us analyze this request.

890
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,040
You said you had some outfits but please consider wearing a cute pair of underwear as well.

891
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,040
Sincerely, a refling.

892
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,040
Shit, okay.

893
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,040
I just might. I just might.

894
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,040
You were clapping with your hands, but yes I was, I'm sitting down.

895
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,040
This is my hands.

896
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,040
We getting copyright struck with that one, are you joking?

897
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,040
I need to see your cheeks clap strongly.

898
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:46,040
Or better I make them clap, frothing at the myth right now.

899
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,040
Thank you.

900
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:53,040
Mummy, I wrote something for you because I'm so brained right now.

901
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,040
Enjoy it.

902
01:19:54,040 --> 01:19:56,040
Hold on, are we doing a live reading?

903
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,040
There's no way we're going to get away with a live reading.

904
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,040
Oh my god, I really am motion sick.

905
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,040
I just looked down at my keyboard there, that really hurt.

906
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,040
Why is it the first sentence I read is,

907
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,040
it's a shame you're such a quick shot cuddle.

908
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,040
Why is it the first thing I read is it's a shame you're a quick shot?

909
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,040
Am I being shamed right now?

910
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,040
I love being shamed.

911
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,040
I mean you are.

912
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,040
Right, but why would that be the opening sentence?

913
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:35,040
Okay, it's a shame you're such a quick shot cuddle because I would very much like to spend as much time with you if I got the chance.

914
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,040
Perhaps we could snuggle under the blankets on a cold and rainy day.

915
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,040
I told you close to my chest and give you a little kisses on the top of your head.

916
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,040
Oh wait, this is actually wholesome.

917
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,040
What the heck?

918
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,040
Do not worry, the snowberry will be dealt with.

919
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:51,040
Special forces use Strone's Metapatreon audio as a torture tactic.

920
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,040
Scream in fear at the strome.

921
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,040
No, thank you.

922
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,040
Sorry, I've been a super chat.

923
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,040
Special forces?

924
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,040
Strone's Metapatreon as torture?

925
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,040
Scream in fear at the strome?

926
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,040
Congrats on 21k.

927
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,040
Oh stop, have it actually.

928
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,040
No way, I am so behind.

929
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,040
Oh, I'm so behind.

930
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,040
But that's okay because we're getting to it.

931
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,040
She's a dragon of fire.

932
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,040
Right, where are we continuing now?

933
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:38,040
I told you close to my chest and give you a little kisses from the top of your head down to your nose

934
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:46,040
and on to those soft lips of yours, nibbling them a little before making my way down your neck and onto your shoulder.

935
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,040
All the while my hands would explode.

936
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,040
Wait, can I?

937
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,040
Wait, what's the last thing?

938
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,040
I don't think I can...

939
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:02,040
All the while my hands would explore you down your back towards that peach of yours,

940
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:07,040
grabbing large handfuls of it, squeezing and massaging each cheek like I was kneading bread.

941
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,040
I'd run a hand along your inner thigh as well, fingers tracing circles around your...

942
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,040
Alright, no, okay, we can't say this, we can't say this, we can't say this.

943
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,040
We can't say that part out loud.

944
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,040
We can't say that part out loud.

945
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,040
Can't say that part out loud.

946
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,040
Imma read the rest, okay?

947
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:35,040
I'm back again because your Twitter post inspired me.

948
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,040
I want you to come straight to me after a ring frit stream all sweaty and out of breath.

949
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:47,040
I don't know if I can read any of the marshmallows.

950
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,040
Okay, what's going on?

951
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,040
The next one, this is how I denialate your holes.

952
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,040
We can...

953
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,040
I don't think I can read any marshmallows.

954
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:03,040
The next one, I was edging and jerking.

955
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,040
No!

956
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:08,040
I can't!

957
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:13,040
Hi, scrawny, hi, reefling, I'm conflicted.

958
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,040
On one hand, I want you to be happy and I never want to upset you.

959
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:21,040
On the other hand, I really like the idea of you being so angry that you post orgasm part to me.

960
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:23,040
I can't read any of the...

961
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,040
Oh my god.

962
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:36,040
Please don't read this out on stream, I'm dying of embarrassment.

963
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,040
Okay, I'm gonna refresh and see if there's anything that I can read.

964
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:52,040
What would you do or say to win the hearts of each of the Vealour girls?

965
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,040
Okay.

966
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,040
Okay, I can attempt this one.

967
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,040
Um...

968
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:05,040
So, Emmy, the third one, she's very independent, so...

969
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,040
I just let her do what she wants.

970
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,040
She does whatever she wants.

971
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,040
Um, to win her heart.

972
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,040
Wait, do you mean like romantically?

973
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,040
I'd just...

974
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,040
I'd go up to...

975
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,040
Sorry, let me mute the background just for a second.

976
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:26,040
I'd go up to Emmy and, you know, she's smaller than me, so I'd lean over, I'd go into her ear

977
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:29,040
and, you know, I'd, like, lift her chin up, so she's, like, looking up.

978
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:33,040
And then I'd go right next to her ear and this is how I went Emmy over.

979
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,040
I'd go like this, I'd go...

980
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,040
Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or...

981
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,040
Because she has finnaf brain rot.

982
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,040
Er, Eysical, how would Eysical?

983
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,040
What would I say in Eysical ear?

984
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,040
Er, Ginger, no, she is Ginger but...

985
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,040
a...

986
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,240
Mummy is Lid Refillings or Lidback Mummy.

987
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,240
Ah, it's because I've tried it!

988
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,240
Ehh...

989
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,240
Ehh...

990
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,240
Eysical...

991
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,240
Eysical...

992
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,240
What would I say to win the heart of Aysby?

993
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,840
I just treat her like a princess, there's really not much to it.

994
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,840
Sheebie...

995
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,640
Sheebie isn't that easy

996
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,640
because she has different layers

997
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,640
to what she likes

998
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,240
and it's very mood-orientated with Sheebie.

999
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,240
Mercy, however, is just in a pet place

1000
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,240
so she's easy as fuck to deal with.

1001
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,240
Azura...

1002
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,240
She again has layers to what she likes.

1003
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,240
So it's hard to pick on one thing.

1004
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,240
It depends on the mood of her, the situation.

1005
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:40,240
Sheebie as well.

1006
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,240
You know, Azura claims that

1007
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:47,240
she's dumb, always around women.

1008
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:50,240
So it might be the case of let her do what she wants.

1009
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,240
Sheebie has layers, onions have layers.

1010
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,240
You get it, right?

1011
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,240
You know, Sheebie's an onion star!

1012
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,240
You know what I mean!

1013
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,240
Just call her Fondaladism.

1014
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,240
Layers like an ogre.

1015
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,240
I've put that in your head too much.

1016
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,240
Sheebie caught in...

1017
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,240
Maybe...

1018
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,240
I don't know, I think Sheebie has an appreciation

1019
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,240
for none kind of stuff.

1020
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,240
So maybe I would...

1021
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,240
I would throw...

1022
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,240
I would grovel on my knees.

1023
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:24,240
I'd throw myself at her on the floor

1024
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:27,240
and basically be like, cure me of my ailments.

1025
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,240
And then that's when her nun side would come out

1026
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,240
and be like, ah, you lost little lamb.

1027
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,240
I will guide you.

1028
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,240
And I'd be like, yes, yes, guide me into that hole.

1029
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:41,240
Azura seems to like war.

1030
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,240
So maybe I'd let her eat me a little bit.

1031
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,240
Just a little bit.

1032
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,240
And...

1033
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,240
None dorm is a thing, yeah.

1034
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,240
Don't...

1035
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,240
Guide me to temptation, Sheebie.

1036
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,240
That's all I ask.

1037
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:57,240
Okay, amen.

1038
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,240
Hey, my man!

1039
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,240
Hi, reflin!

1040
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,240
I'm just a silly little reflin.

1041
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:04,240
Can I have a hug?

1042
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,240
Of course!

1043
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,240
Oh, I'm not wearing...

1044
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,240
If I was using the 3Dio,

1045
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,240
I'd be able to do the hug,

1046
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,240
but I can't do the hug.

1047
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,240
Because it's an SMB.

1048
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,240
I don't know.

1049
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:13,240
Can you tell that I'm hugging right now?

1050
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,240
I have no idea if you can tell I'm hugging it.

1051
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,240
Ah, Demo!

1052
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,240
Thank you for becoming a member.

1053
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,240
Please enjoy the emotes.

1054
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,240
I'm not sorry about the pregnant one.

1055
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,240
It is getting replaced at Lairday.

1056
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,240
Or maybe not, I don't know.

1057
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,240
None dorm, you say?

1058
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,240
Okay, but...

1059
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,240
If you aren't dorm, then do you spend me too?

1060
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:30,240
I could be a member.

1061
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,240
Let me see.

1062
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,240
Also, congrats on 20k.

1063
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,240
Thank you so much!

1064
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:37,240
I'm happy I discovered you.

1065
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:38,240
What you have done has helped me a lot.

1066
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,240
Thank you.

1067
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,240
Oh, thank you!

1068
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:41,240
I'm glad I can help you.

1069
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,240
I'm not sure what I've done to help,

1070
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:44,240
but I'm glad I could.

1071
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,240
Sometimes,

1072
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,240
sometimes maybe just knowing

1073
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,240
that there's silly billies out there in the world,

1074
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:52,240
then that's all you need deep down inside.

1075
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,240
Be careful when you're breathed into the mic.

1076
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,240
Okay, for some reason,

1077
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,240
it's ear-to-ear breathing

1078
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,240
for the 3Dio.

1079
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,240
Ah!

1080
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,240
Oh my god, wait, that emotes combo.

1081
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:07,240
Inkling lick turns into pregnant.

1082
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,240
That was so good.

1083
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,240
Not sure to say apologies

1084
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,240
or congratulations on the tight climb.

1085
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,240
Pitch of coal up there,

1086
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,240
and you'd push out a diamond.

1087
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,240
Reef, what the fuck?

1088
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,240
I'm speechless!

1089
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,240
What if I just read?

1090
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:35,240
Would make a wicked party trick.

1091
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,240
Reef blend!

1092
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,240
Reef blend!

1093
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,240
That's hilarious.

1094
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,240
That's absolutely hilarious.

1095
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,240
Don't type that ever again, though.

1096
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,240
Does that make myself clear?

1097
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,240
Don't type that ever again.

1098
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,240
What was that?

1099
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:58,240
Pressure's so intense, it could be diamonds.

1100
01:28:58,240 --> 01:28:59,240
Wait, that's...

1101
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,240
Mummy funded me a lot.

1102
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,240
Real answer.

1103
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,240
Eh...

1104
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,240
My injured toe?

1105
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,240
What you done to your toe?

1106
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:19,240
Am I about to look at some gross toes?

1107
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,240
It's okay, my toe's gross as well.

1108
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,240
We can have gross toes together.

1109
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:25,240
We could be toe cross lovers.

1110
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,240
Well, you said...

1111
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,240
Oh no, wait, hold on, I'm too dumb.

1112
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,240
I need to just remove the brackets.

1113
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:33,240
I'm a smart gal.

1114
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,240
Oh my god, you fucked up your toe.

1115
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,240
You did fuck up, it's all bruised.

1116
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,240
Hi, someone says hi.

1117
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,240
Hi, Reef blend.

1118
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,240
Who stopped her toe? When did we finish it?

1119
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,240
She did.

1120
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,240
Changes the diamond of meaning in the rough.

1121
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:49,240
I assure you, my guts are nice and smooth, baby.

1122
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:51,240
Hi, Johnny.

1123
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:53,240
Hi.

1124
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:55,240
I want to fill your cake and turn it into a cream puff.

1125
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,240
I give you my permission tonight.

1126
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:03,240
Petition to name...

1127
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,240
Rename the nether...

1128
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,240
To the diamond mains one.

1129
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,240
Instead of clam.

1130
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,240
Instead of clam.

1131
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,240
A Scottish lullaby singing stream.

1132
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,240
Is there even a Scottish lullaby?

1133
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,240
I know.

1134
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:19,240
Scottish lullaby lyrics.

1135
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,240
Let's see what comes up with this one, I reckon.

1136
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,240
The oldest known lullaby

1137
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,240
is a Babylonian lullaby found

1138
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,240
and scribed on a clay tablet

1139
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,240
about 4,000 years ago.

1140
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,240
Okay, but what's that got to do with Scottish lullabies?

1141
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:41,240
Wait.

1142
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,240
Why...is there not...

1143
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,240
There's a lullaby called Dream Angus.

1144
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,240
I don't want copyright.

1145
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,240
Dream Angus.

1146
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,240
Okay, I don't want copyright.

1147
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,240
I don't know with Scottish lullaby.

1148
01:30:59,240 --> 01:31:01,240
I wish we were so back in the mines.

1149
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,240
Just a random something.

1150
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,240
What a rare clam.

1151
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,240
Most only make perils.

1152
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,240
I'll have to investigate thoroughly.

1153
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,240
Scottish lullabies be like,

1154
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,240
If you didn't go to bed, I'll knock you upside the heat

1155
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,240
with my whiskey mug.

1156
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,240
Till you honk shoo.

1157
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,240
Oh my god.

1158
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,240
How we do it? What would the pacing of that be?

1159
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,240
There you go.

1160
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,240
There's some Scottish lullabies for you.

1161
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:39,240
Just how many special

1162
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:41,240
interests are you going to unlock me?

1163
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:43,240
Brian!

1164
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:57,240
I mean, no, that's true.

1165
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,240
That's definitely true.

1166
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,240
You have to admit, mommy,

1167
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,240
we are the biggest collection of the gems.

1168
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,240
I mean, yeah.

1169
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,240
But it's not the best part.

1170
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,240
That was my desktop appearance.

1171
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:13,240
There's comments and generous donations.

1172
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:15,240
Would you have it any other way?

1173
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:17,240
Would I have it any other way?

1174
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,240
Nah, I like how we got it.

1175
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,240
We got it.

1176
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,240
Yeah.

1177
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,240
Maybe we need to do a marshmallow-specific stream.

1178
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,240
Unlike here's subjects we should talk about.

1179
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,240
Cause, um...

1180
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:35,240
Reeflings reflect the moment.

1181
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,240
We cannot be more proud of it.

1182
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,240
Just back from sudden Elden Ring myth and error.

1183
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,240
Yeah, unfortunately I'm getting motion sick.

1184
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:43,240
I'm not very well at the moment.

1185
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:45,240
Cause of...

1186
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:47,240
I can't believe it.

1187
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,240
But there's this thing called exhaustion.

1188
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,240
I think I'm starting to hit it, you know?

1189
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,240
Forget hitting the wall.

1190
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,240
I'm not Hag V Trooper yet, okay?

1191
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,240
But apparently,

1192
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,240
exhaustion can make you more nauseous

1193
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:01,240
and motion sick.

1194
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,240
And I'm messing it up for myself.

1195
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,240
Who the fuck?

1196
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,240
I'm allergic to seafood

1197
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,240
but I definitely eat you till my throat gets sore

1198
01:33:09,240 --> 01:33:11,240
and I'm gasping for air. Please don't die.

1199
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,240
I don't have an AP pen on me.

1200
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
Does anyone have an AP pen for that one reefling?

1201
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,240
Oh my god!

1202
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,240
Imagine getting a random lick

1203
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,240
at a convention

1204
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:23,240
and then someone needs an AP pen

1205
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,240
cause they lick too.

1206
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:27,240
I hear it really happens a lot

1207
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,240
in Super Monkey Vault, okay?

1208
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,240
How did they... how did they get past that?

1209
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,240
They might be nice people.

1210
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,240
Okay, Strawny, reefling.

1211
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,240
Uh, how many

1212
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,240
special interests are you going to unlock?

1213
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:41,240
First it was backdoor, then it's feet, and now it's pits

1214
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:43,240
and sniffa. Woman, you have no idea how terrible

1215
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:45,240
you're making me. First thing I see in the morning

1216
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,240
and it's that art, I want to tie you up, lick you all over

1217
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,240
and devour you!

1218
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,240
I'm sorry.

1219
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,240
By the same time you're welcome.

1220
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,240
I'm just broadening

1221
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:57,240
your horizons, okay?

1222
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,240
What's life if you can't

1223
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,240
enjoy a few of the

1224
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,240
spaces it offers on the

1225
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,240
site? Huh?

1226
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,240
Yeah.

1227
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,240
Never let Mercy play this.

1228
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,240
She'd be in a coma. Oh no, and Mercy's not

1229
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:13,240
touching this game. If I

1230
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:15,240
literally see her put it in her schedule

1231
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,240
it's getting pulled. The first

1232
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,240
pulled schedule ever

1233
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,240
of Viola, and it's because

1234
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,240
it's a motion sick game.

1235
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:25,240
Um...

1236
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,240
You down agritus amount

1237
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,240
of water.

1238
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:31,240
Uh, I found you

1239
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,240
recently and I love your videos. You seem like

1240
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,240
fun to hang out with. Oh thank you, I'm glad.

1241
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,240
Even though

1242
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,240
you've caught me on the worst day though.

1243
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,240
Literally like the most exhausted and tired of me

1244
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,240
then.

1245
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,240
I'm gonna, what the plan

1246
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,240
is, I'll get a nap and then

1247
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,240
I'll prepare for Arisa.

1248
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,240
I'll go harass her. Arisa is

1249
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,240
Ozzy, by the way. Ozzy, Ozzy, Ozzy.

1250
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,240
Oi, oi, oi.

1251
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,240
Oi, oi, oi.

1252
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,240
So get ready for the

1253
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:01,240
Newzanker Australian accent.

1254
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:03,240
Reporting

1255
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,240
live here today,

1256
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:07,240
I'm playing with Arisa

1257
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:09,240
on a game called Living Out 2

1258
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,240
of something of that nature.

1259
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,240
Uh, turns out we both

1260
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,240
have access

1261
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,240
to Xbox Game Pass

1262
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,240
and together

1263
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,240
we are going to play the game.

1264
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,240
Whether

1265
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,240
or not we will be able

1266
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,240
to connect with our internet

1267
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,240
providers is a different question.

1268
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:31,240
However, we will

1269
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,240
try our best.

1270
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,240
Okay. I can't ignore that.

1271
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,240
I can't ignore the Ozzy

1272
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,240
Newz presenter down.

1273
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,240
I'm moving into your pants

1274
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:43,240
right now.

1275
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,240
I'm just moving into your pants, Diego.

1276
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:47,240
I can give you a bit of space for that.

1277
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,240
Um,

1278
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,240
yes, that's probably the best accent

1279
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,240
I can do for the Ozzy

1280
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:55,240
because it's fucking impossible

1281
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,240
to mimic them on a daily

1282
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,240
basis.

1283
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:01,240
Um,

1284
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,240
it's really hard to mimic an Ozzy accent.

1285
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:05,240
It's next to impossible.

1286
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,240
E.

1287
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,240
Excuse me,

1288
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:11,240
mommy. My thumb is about an inch or two

1289
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,240
long. I can definitely show you what can be

1290
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,240
done with it whilst I'm

1291
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,240
reeling it from behind.

1292
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:19,240
Oh, uh-huh.

1293
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,240
Mm-hmm.

1294
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,240
I dare you.

1295
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,240
I was going to send a smooth pickup line

1296
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,240
I heard recently, but I forgot.

1297
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,240
I'm staying awake for it. Oh, I'm staying awake.

1298
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,240
I know it's not my usual stream time

1299
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,240
aim, but

1300
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,240
it would probably be like two hours of shenanigans.

1301
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,240
Maybe less than two hours. I'll tell

1302
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,240
Arisa what's up. Arisa's not going to be like,

1303
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,240
only gets runny. Probably retired.

1304
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,240
No, Arisa's going to be like, fuck yeah,

1305
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,240
understand.

1306
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:47,240
She sees that mass is online all the time.

1307
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:49,240
Um,

1308
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,240
she's really good. She's really very attentive.

1309
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,240
You should do a Steve Irwin

1310
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,240
watch along.

1311
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:57,240
G'day.

1312
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,240
No, he doesn't say that. He does not

1313
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:01,240
say that. Sorry. He does not say

1314
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:03,240
that. That's what Ozzy's saying.

1315
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,240
Although he is a certified Ozzy.

1316
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,240
Would he say it?

1317
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,240
Maybe not on camera. Maybe not next

1318
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,240
to the crocodile. Okay.

1319
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,240
Think of what Steve Irwin would want.

1320
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,240
Okay.

1321
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,240
I'm going to get a whole two minutes sleep tonight

1322
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:19,240
for real, for real me. Crikey.

1323
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,240
Crikey, she's a beaut.

1324
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,240
I'll probably have to watch the

1325
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,240
VOD. It's 3am. Oh, yeah.

1326
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,240
No, don't, don't force yourself.

1327
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,240
As I said, it's not in my usual time

1328
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,240
slot. So please don't feel

1329
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,240
forced to show up live. You know, you can

1330
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:35,240
always watch the VOD.

1331
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,240
A cheeky, you know, special shout out

1332
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,240
to the VOD watchers or people who catch me

1333
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,240
live. You know what? Shout out to fucking

1334
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,240
everyone. Okay. That fucks with me. You fuck

1335
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,240
with me. I'll fuck with you. Okay. Getting that

1336
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:47,240
bed right now and take those boxers off.

1337
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:49,240
Okay. You fuck with me. I'll fuck with you.

1338
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,240
If it's only two hours, then I'm going to watch it

1339
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:57,240
in bed and keep it in the background.

1340
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,240
That fucking restaurant is all right in the

1341
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,240
background.

1342
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,240
Shout out to the lurkers. Literally, lurkers

1343
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:09,240
appreciate you. Liveers

1344
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:11,240
appreciate you. Voders appreciate you.

1345
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,240
Clippers appreciate you.

1346
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:15,240
Commenters appreciate you.

1347
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,240
Lakers appreciate you.

1348
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:19,240
Everyone,

1349
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,240
everyone that fucks with me, I fuck

1350
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,240
with you. Getting that bed.

1351
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:29,240
Don't straw, don't, don't straw

1352
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:31,240
me. I can't even read now. I've lost the ability

1353
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,240
to read. Don't worry, straw me.

1354
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,240
I will treat you like fine art. Now let

1355
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,240
me pin you against the wall and nail you.

1356
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,240
Okay. That was good. I'll give you that.

1357
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:43,240
That was good. I'm going to give you

1358
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,240
that one.

1359
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:49,240
Maybe, maybe I can pin you to the wall with

1360
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:51,240
my legs. Is that possible?

1361
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,240
I don't have upper body strength, but

1362
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,240
I might be able to

1363
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:57,240
really mess you up like that.

1364
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,240
I mean, I can, I can choke you out.

1365
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,240
Yeah. That makes up for it. My inability

1366
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,240
to lift you and pin you against the wall

1367
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,240
is undone because I have thighs

1368
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,240
or something. I don't know. Sorry, I'm starting

1369
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:13,240
to lose the ability to make comprehensive

1370
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,240
cohesive sentences.

1371
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:17,240
Okay.

1372
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,240
I need to go for it now.

1373
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,240
It's not happening.

1374
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,240
Just as qualify as story after dark

1375
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,240
soon, maybe, sometime.

1376
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,240
You say that, but last stream

1377
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:35,240
I didn't stay until the end and the

1378
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,240
VOD got taken away. Oh no, those streams are going back up.

1379
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,240
Nothing seems to be happening with the

1380
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:41,240
DMCA issues.

1381
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,240
So

1382
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:47,240
I am going to

1383
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:49,240
pop it up

1384
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,240
soon. I don't, there's no,

1385
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:53,240
the problem is there's

1386
01:39:53,240 --> 01:39:55,240
like one VOD that has 50 claims

1387
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,240
and if for whatever reason

1388
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,240
the studio claimed that my channel

1389
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:01,240
would be gone and it makes me nervous

1390
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,240
but I think it's fine.

1391
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,240
Okay.

1392
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,240
Get some rest.

1393
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,240
So because

1394
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,240
we played the campaign of Lord of the Rings

1395
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,240
it had the actual music

1396
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:15,240
from the movies in it

1397
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,240
and it making me

1398
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,240
a very nervous, so a private

1399
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,240
I would not risk a whole thing

1400
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,240
for it personally.

1401
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:25,240
I don't, well nothing's happened.

1402
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:27,240
Now if there was a warning

1403
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,240
or a claim

1404
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:31,240
or I had, you know, like I looked up

1405
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,240
if other people had played the game and the games are

1406
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,240
fully up so it would be very

1407
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,240
it would be

1408
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,240
an outlier if for some

1409
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,240
reason

1410
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,240
I got copyrighted

1411
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,240
but no one else did

1412
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,240
that has all of these things.

1413
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,240
Okay, so I think it's okay.

1414
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,240
Sony, let us wear her thighs

1415
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,240
like a scarf. Occasionally choking is

1416
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,240
appreciated.

1417
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,240
Whoa.

1418
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,240
I need to stretch my own bed.

1419
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,240
Token says fuck you in particular.

1420
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,240
Can you imagine?

1421
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,240
Saron with one finger on the report fund.

1422
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:11,240
I have to see.

1423
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:13,240
Too much talking. Hydration time.

1424
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,240
Fine, fine, I'll hydrate.

1425
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,240
Okay.

1426
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,240
Then it says, it goes there.

1427
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,240
I used out some images of you

1428
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,240
ready for later but I'm running out of ink

1429
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,240
so they look a bit funny.

1430
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:27,240
Wait, wait until

1431
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,240
I drop the butt pic.

1432
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,240
I'll try and do that as soon as I can.

1433
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:33,240
There's people over at the minute.

1434
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,240
Careful, don't get in trouble.

1435
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,240
Oh my god, don't

1436
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,240
print pictures at work

1437
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,240
by the way, they know what you're

1438
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,240
what you're printing.

1439
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:47,240
So you know

1440
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:49,240
your work know what you print out.

1441
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,240
They can see it.

1442
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,240
And they call it a mine, mine, mine

1443
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:55,240
mine, mine, mine, mine

1444
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:57,240
Hi momay, hi

1445
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,240
I love you, I love you too.

1446
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,240
I think that however

1447
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,240
um

1448
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,240
Oh, okay, right, that's actually just feedback.

1449
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,240
I mean, fuck it, we can discuss it.

1450
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,240
Okay, so Riflin says the

1451
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:15,240
Patreon content is too short. I'm not sure

1452
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:17,240
if it's problematical or that

1453
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:19,240
inconspicuous thing. No.

1454
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,240
So

1455
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:23,240
I am very aware that

1456
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:25,240
I cannot ask too much of the girls.

1457
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,240
Okay, so I can't

1458
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:29,240
ask them to stream and then

1459
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,240
a 30 minute audio

1460
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,240
does not take 30 minutes to produce

1461
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,240
and I know you know this and I'm not

1462
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,240
you know, I'm not saying anything. I know

1463
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:39,240
you know that it takes longer.

1464
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:41,240
If I asked the girls to produce

1465
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:43,240
a 30 minute audio

1466
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,240
it would take them probably

1467
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,240
an hour to record

1468
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,240
and now you could

1469
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:51,240
argue, hey, you know

1470
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,240
well it's their job type thing

1471
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:55,240
it's in the contract type thing

1472
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,240
I have to

1473
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:59,240
enable the girls

1474
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:01,240
to just listen to it twice if I said

1475
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:03,240
I have to enable the girls

1476
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:05,240
now I have not

1477
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:07,240
if they want to make their own

1478
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,240
scripts, if they want to go above

1479
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,240
and beyond, they can

1480
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,240
add live the scripts, they don't have to stick to the

1481
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:15,240
scripts, they can add sections if they want

1482
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,240
but I am very

1483
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,240
aware I cannot ask too much

1484
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,240
of the girls because if I ask them too

1485
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:23,240
much, they are going to be too stressed

1486
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,240
and not want to stream, they're going to be

1487
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,240
unable to do fun projects

1488
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,240
on the side that they want to pursue

1489
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,240
collabs maybe with other people

1490
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,240
all that kind of thing

1491
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,240
when

1492
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,240
you know kind of being in

1493
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,240
this position, I have to take

1494
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,240
stress into consideration

1495
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,240
especially for them who have

1496
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,240
not moved out in particular

1497
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,240
they do not have the freedom

1498
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,240
or privacy to record

1499
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,240
for such lengths

1500
01:43:51,240 --> 01:43:53,240
at this point in time

1501
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,240
now I'm more than happy to bring it up

1502
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,240
in the meeting if you want me to

1503
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:59,240
see what people's discussions and things are

1504
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:01,240
I do comprehend that they might

1505
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:03,240
be too short but there are so many

1506
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:05,240
factors that come into

1507
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,240
why the audios

1508
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,240
might be

1509
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,240
less than

1510
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,240
I am going to aim for more than

1511
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,240
10 minutes though, I have

1512
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:17,240
put in a little tidbit for the girls

1513
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:19,240
to be like try and aim for

1514
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,240
over 10 minutes

1515
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,240
I can slowly

1516
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,240
work up to

1517
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:27,240
12 minutes to 15 minutes

1518
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,240
15 minutes is probably my hard cut

1519
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,240
off because

1520
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,240
you know some of the girls

1521
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,240
already have trouble recording as it is

1522
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,240
you know

1523
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:39,240
and

1524
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,240
recording audios as well

1525
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,240
does take it out of you

1526
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,240
it's not

1527
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:47,240
you pop in the booth and you're like full energy

1528
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,240
like no you're fucking like

1529
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:51,240
especially for

1530
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,240
those

1531
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,240
who are

1532
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,240
is it method acting? No, it's not

1533
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:59,240
what is it? Live acting? Whatever

1534
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:01,240
you want to call it okay

1535
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,240
it's a lot

1536
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,240
and you know

1537
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:07,240
you're trying to do multiple

1538
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,240
things at once

1539
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,240
but yes I

1540
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,240
can definitely relay that I can ask

1541
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:15,240
the girls what they think

1542
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,240
what their stress levels are in terms

1543
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,240
of how they feel the patreon

1544
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,240
audios are going I am more than open to these

1545
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:23,240
discussions

1546
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:25,240
please don't think I'm just going to sweep

1547
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:27,240
it under the work type thing

1548
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,240
but just as a whole on the very

1549
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:31,240
surface if you just want to take it at face

1550
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,240
value there's a lot of factors

1551
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,240
why

1552
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,240
I can't actually ask the girls to do a

1553
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,240
30 minute audio however

1554
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,240
I am not stopping them from producing

1555
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,240
that they can write their own scripts if they so desire

1556
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,240
I am aware I think some of the girls

1557
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:47,240
actually are writing

1558
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,240
scripts with you in their member

1559
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:51,240
streams possibly

1560
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:55,240
but yes there's a lot

1561
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,240
of factors to why

1562
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,240
and

1563
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,240
they do their own stunts

1564
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,240
yes they do their own stunts

1565
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:05,240
and

1566
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:07,240
yeah

1567
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:09,240
yeah no I'm open to

1568
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:11,240
discuss and look kind of

1569
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,240
your climate

1570
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,240
would say it would be best for making perils

1571
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,240
yeah but the peril is

1572
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,240
slang for something else

1573
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:21,240
so

1574
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:23,240

they could ask for it yep absolutely

1582
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:43,240

I can't stop thinking about you

1660
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:47,240
you always talk about how stinky and sweaty you are

1670
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:11,240

1671
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,240

it's bad

1673
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:17,240

1674
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,240

1675
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:23,240

I don't want to take it

01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:39,240
tingling on your tentacle

is that a thing for guys

01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:47,240
I don't know

1787
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,240
