1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I did not get filtered so hard from Bioshock. I needed a piss. I didn't want you guys to throw up.

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I had to use the fucking screen because I went for a piss.

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hold on, what one's the game? Hi! Hi! This is Stronghold.

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't wind me up. Hold on, wait, hold on. Oh shit, wait, no, I was going to do a meme.

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hold on, wait, forget I came on. Wait, forget I came on.

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This guy isn't working. Fuck. It's supposed to be like this. Hold on.

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't fucking see it.

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, there we go. There it is, there's the gag.

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hold on, hold on. That was the second part.

10
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's it, that's literally the gag. That's how much I try harder than that.

11
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I went on Twitter really quickly and I was checking on the girl, seeing when they were up there because I was passed out.

12
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And someone was like, play Halo. I'm like, play Halo without me str-

13
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think fuck not. So obviously I replied and then she DM'd me and she was like, you're the first person I thought of.

14
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I'm like, oh, I'm gonna fucking cry. I literally said in her message, I was like, I keep making everyone play fucking puzzle games with me

15
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
because we were originally going to play Portal 2 together but then it got delayed because of timing issues and all that.

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And she's like, no, no, we'll still play Portal 2 and I'm like, oh god, I'm still making everyone play a random puzzle game. Fuck.

17
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But yeah, there you go. That was funny.

18
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I was mildly entertaining in my head. Wait, how have I got two of those?

19
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, and then I have a really funny marshmallow that made me hee-hee-ha. Oh, my fingers crashed.

20
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, this is, I'm so sorry to the person who sent this marshmallow. This made me laugh, okay?

21
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
More Halo while you are getting more Halo, unironically.

22
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
More Halo.

23
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hi, Brian. I actually heard you that time.

24
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
MNS188.

25
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you for the super chat. Yes, you're getting more Halo.

26
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Uh, I just want to address this marshmallow which might be the most controversial thing I will ever address in my lifetime as Stony Cuddles.

27
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Please, my good refling, my good sir.

28
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I assure you, I am about one brain wrinkle away from being room temperature IQ.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It is not your fault if I misunderstand you.

30
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I am not well-beared in these kinds of thing, of this thing called human interaction, okay?

31
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Because I can't hear your voice either. I can't see where you're putting commas.

32
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't see where you're putting tone behind things, okay?

33
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So please do not worry if I misunderstand you.

34
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I assure you, I am an absolute brainlet and the problem does not lie with you, okay?

35
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Does that make sense?

36
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Um, I know it makes you die a little.

37
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Inside, I apologise. It's not, it's just, I'm not very smart. I really am not.

38
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Um, I'm actually rather hearted.

39
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sometimes a wish is real, honestly.

40
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What have I missed? We sung a little bit of Halo.

41
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I swear you've got an amazing accent.

42
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thanks, I spawned in with it.

43
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you spawn in in Scotland too, you'll end up sounding like this.

44
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Or if you move to Scotland, you might pick up the accent, although I don't know how true that is.

45
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If later in life you move somewhere and they say, that marshmallow is my marshmallow.

46
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's a one minute ago. Well, I've caught you twice in the act.

47
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Um, but I did, I did, I thought this one gave me a little tee-hee, a little eesh-hee-hee-hee.

48
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Um, um, someone wants to just put, what, the back half of your hair into a ponytail.

49
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Someone wants me to wear a ponytail.

50
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

51
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is that because you want me to imply that I'm going to give you...

52
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That thing?

53
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're already picking up your accent via osmosis.

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
From a high concentration gradient to a low concentration gradient through a something-something barrier.

55
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I've completely forgotten.

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Um, someone just says, have a nice afternoon.

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We'll may love you so much. Love you too.

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay, who's ready for some game crashing on Bioshock to me?

59
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm ready.

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I did not realise how quickly we were about to finish the game.

61
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Turns out there's only three more missions left if you can consider me replaying Fontaine's location.

62
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We're literally about to finish the game.

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Um, she already got handlebars.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can't wait for you to see my surprise because I got my surprise soon to aim.

65
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I can rate this bake with no handlebars.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No handlebars.

67
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please don't look at my elbow. It's not attached.

68
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The accent is spreading but Sunderers don't pick up on what blend it is.

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now I declare, what are you talking about?

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm from Louisiana.

71
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's very hot right now.

72
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, now I'm going to open up the game because I've completely forgotten how on Earth I've opened this goddamn game.

73
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm just going to go for it and pray that OBS picks up the game because I didn't change no sentence on it.

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And then we'll make sure that the desktop is synchronised, synchronised to do.

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Can you complete the game in eight hours?

76
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I played like five hours of it.

77
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm in Fontaine's lair.

78
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Unfortunately, we did have a little oopsie-oopsie with a bug.

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I was going to play it off but you guys wanted me to play it on so I'll play it on your face.

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why did I just get whispered to?

81
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh my god, we have a...

82
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't remember this. Am I going mental?

83
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, it's because it's their advertisement.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Australia? Fucking Australia, can't.

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sorry.

86
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It also had a content creator reach out to me and she's like,

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm like, I just added her right before the stream and I'm like, I'm so sorry, I'm about to stream,

88
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
but what are you some more hopeful you want to do if you have a preference?

89
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And she's like, nah, no preference, just let the autism guide us.

90
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I'm like, fuck yeah, you're my kind of content creator.

91
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If that's the way we communicate with one another,

92
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
we're like, yeah, just let the autism take the wheel.

93
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What the fuck, that's so wildly inappropriate.

94
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I love it here. I love it here.

95
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I saw him saying, people, oh, v-tubers are so cat either through this or this or that.

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No, motherfucker, you have to find the fucking gems.

97
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And if the gems say, let the autism take the wheel,

98
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you know you're in good hands with that person you're interacting with.

99
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Get out.

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And remember to spend your adamantium.

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay.

102
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Also, congrats if your name's Adam.

103
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam.

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, great flings.

105
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, I didn't do all my announcements.

106
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you're a bleeding heart, you got two Patreon audio uploads, please do enjoy.

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You also got a short upload where a zero was touching something,

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
very sus, but please enjoy.

109
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you are a hair member,

110
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
she's already done all her Patreon,

111
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
so there's not much of an update.

112
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll just come out when it comes out.

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's already pre-listed in all that shit.

114
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
She also has a new short coming that is out,

115
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and it's about her being a girl failure or something.

116
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know, v-tubers really like that terminology.

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think it's an insult, but that's just me.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can watch it now.

119
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's literally on her YouTube channel if you're a hair member.

120
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, yeah, check it out.

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
ASICAL also has a new short out.

122
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes, I did a lot of work yesterday.

123
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Can you tell that I'm proud of how much work I did?

124
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
ASICAL's Patreon Perfect Fine is already available.

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
She had a short come out,

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and I've completely forgotten the nature of it.

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Now, Emmy does have a short unlisted.

128
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've given her control when she wants to upload it,

129
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
because obviously Emmy now has access to at least uploading shorts again,

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
which is fine, which is good,

131
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
because she's got three really good ones on the way,

132
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
which I think you guys are going to love.

133
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I've unlisted it.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's up to her if she wants to put it out yet,

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
or if she'd rather do some sit-along with the algorithm

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and wait for the one that I think is going to be popular.

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's up to her.

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm not forcing anyone to do anything.

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I just tag them and bag them.

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm not even kidding.

141
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I upload the shorts, and I schedule them,

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and then I unlist them for those who would rather get a little bit late.

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Emmy also got a Patreon-filled Patreon upload.

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The audio...

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think it was the roommate body swap,

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
so she fucking shags it.

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's the newest Emmy audio.

148
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Snippets!

149
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Snippets, your lovely senpai,

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
did also get an upload of a short where she was feeding people like fucking seagulls.

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
She like mashed the crisps up in her hand and then offered it to them.

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Azura's Patreon audios were giant tests.

153
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I finally did it.

154
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's a giant test, right?

155
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So, you're a regular schmugular size,

156
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and you're dating a giant test,

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but you're not really dating.

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're like a one night stand type thing,

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
but then the end of the plot implies you're going to do more.

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So depending on how much praise it gets,

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
if it's a well-liked audio,

162
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll give it a sequel.

163
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not that well-liked.

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll just leave it as it is, regular schmugular.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then another one where you tie Azura up unbelievably.

166
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
How dare you?

167
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
As for Mercy, Snippets again have a further update for you.

168
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The third editor is in play and has already edited the Mercy audio.

169
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So I'm going to make a little handshake emote with the Snippets today.

170
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My job, once I finished Bioshock 2 and had a little brain rot to myself,

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I am going to subtitle the wazoo out of that YouTube roleplay for Mercy.

172
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then I'm going to upload it.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
She also has a highlight of, I believe, Harvester is the game.

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The highlight is unlisted.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not being published yet.

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So either the highlight will come out or the ASMR will come out.

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But I think the ASMR is probably going to come out.

178
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I got caught up on a heck of a lot of work.

179
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So please do enjoy any shorts you find,

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
any Patreon audios that may have came out.

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
As for Snow Berries and Pin Pals,

182
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
your two lovely Oshideces are going to kiss...

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, not actually, sorry.

184
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I forgot how much you guys meme about kissing.

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No.

186
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You guys are going to have a collab on Icy's channel

187
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
to return the favour for when Emmers was away

188
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and they did a collab on her channel.

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
No, they're not kissing.

190
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Stop it.

191
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You're not winning.

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Fucking last time I tried to write that script.

193
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh, they're kissing.

194
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
They're kissing.

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
No, they're not.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They're not kissing.

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm not making them kiss.

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The Sheeby for the harem,

199
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
just like in all of the other Seekers at this point.

200
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Harem, fantastic news for Harem.

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sheeby is getting very close to finishing a YouTube roleplay.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's more free bonus content on top of what she already provides.

203
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Everyone is working their little tushies off

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and they're doing fantastic.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I just hope we're avoiding burnout,

206
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
making sure no one's stressed.

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I was working with Azura yesterday, fantastic.

208
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And we were getting to the bottom of her donathon.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now, I'm not going to say what's inside it,

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
but we're getting to the bottom of it.

211
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So a graphic is going to be made soon.

212
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm going to hope it's all good and Gucci and no one...

213
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean, Azura did work together on it.

214
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I suggested what I thought was a good idea

215
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
then Azura came in and helped kind of refine it

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
to a much higher quality of what she was interested in.

217
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Can I just say,

218
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
God damn, if you are a belittling heart,

219
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you are in for a fun time with her rewards, okay?

220
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
As always, I did try and focus on Mitchell Mitchell public reward.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay, is that enough rambling for now?

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think so.

223
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay, I got my cup of tea.

224
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know, maybe I should just read Marshmallows

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
so I can actually have a warm cup of tea for once, right?

226
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're a fuck it.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm looking at marshmallows.

228
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I want a warm cup of tea.

229
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't think I could possibly leak any more secrets from Villalor.

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That was the most ridiculous thing.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Honestly, I know we've moved on from feature.

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We've moved on from features.

233
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm literally one of my know or do I not count?

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Am I an honorary feature, bro?

235
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I moved on.

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Hi, hi, Eastland.

237
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay, just so it's rude since there are others.

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, no, did I miss something?

239
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh, unless they want to kiss.

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, I'm also going to try and refine my one-on-one collab,

241
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
ASMR collabs with everyone

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
because I would really love to have all my collabs with Villalor

243
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
up ASMR-wise.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And then the girls can kind of start,

245
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
what would you like to do?

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And then I can kind of get in there, you know?

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I make conversation-wise.

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh, my apologies.

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was like, yeah, damn, getting insulted at the fucking date.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Someone says, I love you, my rarted beloved.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I love you too, mate.

252
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Are you?

253
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I feel like you, as a refilling, hold more IQ than I do.

254
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So I can't really say it.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I like the giant script idea.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I think there should be more in-character themes often

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
than random ones.

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's a very difficult path to lead

259
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
because if I shoehorn them into a tight,

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
because, you know, take Azure's giantessness, for example,

261
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
you know, it's like, right, used as a figurine,

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
okay, maybe in between the cleavage, okay,

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
maybe in the mouth, okay.

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But to do, was it four times 12 is a big number?

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
48 audios.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
In one year, 48 audios will be produced.

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
For them all to contain the same tag is not possible.

268
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Now, I know you're not asking for the same tag.

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I know you're asking for a little cheeky bit more of the,

270
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
is it kayfabe?

271
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
A bit more on par with the kayfabe.

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I understand that, but you have to understand,

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I want to drown people.

274
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So I can't quite, you know, stick to it.

275
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know what you mean, but,

276
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and I know you're also giving me the benefit

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
of the doubt in the same breath.

278
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Also, speaking of role play, I'm a weirdo,

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
just like, yeah, bro, I'll do anything.

280
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Fuck yeah.

281
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
See, you're the target audience.

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're the perfect motherfucker.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I think you could sprinkle them in now and then.

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes, so, Jin was me script-wise,

285
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and I kind of put everyone on par,

286
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
except for myself, because I'm a little fucking meme lord.

287
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I like meme and writing and stuff like that.

288
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's my favorite thing to do,

289
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
literally, that membership stream move.

290
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But yes, no, I do understand you want more

291
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
kind of in character role plays.

292
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes, I comprehend.

293
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I listen.

294
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I want to drown people.

295
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Literally, cramming all this content

296
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
into his mummies, becoming a content feeder.

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Real and true.

298
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
For ASMR when?

299
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You don't want to fuck it.

300
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You don't want to fuck it.

301
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You get what you want.

302
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You get what you fucking want.

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hold on.

304
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I need the message.

305
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll message on the person that drew it.

306
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Hello.

307
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Again.

308
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Vibe, comma.

309
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I hope you are well.

310
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The pregnancy ASMR video did great,

311
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and I'd love to do its chaos.

312
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Possibly getting three variation artworks of war.

313
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Of war.

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There is this subject

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
that you are comfortable commissioning.

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Question mark.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There you go.

318
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
5% profits in the pudding.

319
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There you go.

320
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You get what you want around here.

321
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I've sent the DM.

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It is what it is.

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I wheeled too much about it.

324
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Vorkalab?

325
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How can you vorkalab?

326
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What?

327
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I fucking take your head and then they take your legs?

328
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What?

329
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How can you vorkalab?

330
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Or we kiss over you?

331
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Mummy is going to send us to the rapture,

332
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and we love it.

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Literally going to the rapture.

334
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We deserve in her society.

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You are getting bored.

336
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This business correspondence is so unprofessional,

337
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
but when it's like,

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
oh no, I have to actually communicate.

339
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Mummy, love you.

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Now drink your tea.

341
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Shit.

342
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You got my refill.

343
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
How the fuck did you time that so well?

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Scottish Vee, should we sit?

345
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
We'll be right back.

346
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Ray Queen, I followed your Patreon.

347
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I love it.

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm glad you enjoy it.

349
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
May I have your consent to enjoy it?

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes.

351
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You have all the permission in the world.

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Remember to save.

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We've not even started.

354
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm trying to frickin' drink this.

355
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The vorkalab is the fight over the most tender...

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh, the vorkalab is the fight over the most...

357
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That makes sense.

358
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Collab partner is you,

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or in your tummy.

360
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have an update.

361
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay.

362
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Your dog,

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
or should I say our dog bowl?

364
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Because we're both getting a dog.

365
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So the dog bowls are coming first.

366
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Okay?

367
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And then the collars are coming next.

368
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The collars said they're going to take next month,

369
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
but by the end of this month,

370
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
the dog bowls are here, okay?

371
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So...

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We're doing it.

373
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We're being degenerates together.

374
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Do you like soft or hard?

375
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Definitely soft.

376
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'd rather keep you alive by then,

377
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
but you know, the little regurgitation,

378
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
that's all good with me.

379
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You gave us plenty of updates about the girls,

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
so when's your next alternative Twitter audio today?

381
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm ovulating.

382
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I know I'm ovulating,

383
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
because slime is coming out of me.

384
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And it's clear,

385
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and that's when I know I'm ovulating.

386
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So you get an audio today.

387
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can finally take your voice.

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Hi, Stroni.

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If I ever become the president,

390
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'd make you the secretary of transportation.

391
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why that position you might ask?

392
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Because you have experience hauling

393
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
that massive cake around all day.

394
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Thank you.

395
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Thank you.

396
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, my God.

397
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's time for prego.

398
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, there you go.

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Inkling time.

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Inkling time.

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hi, Stroni.

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Just some bio shock lore.

403
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oh, I do love a bit of video game lore.

404
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You may have missed,

405
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
well, in the panic because you were playing.

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The scientist and raptor put a sea slug

407
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
in the head of the little girls,

408
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
turning them into little sisters.

409
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And the sea slugs,

410
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Vergey, Volna.

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Thank you for becoming a member.

412
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Enjoy the pregnancy,

413
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and all the other stuff.

414
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There's quite a few of them.

415
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Sea slug Adam in the blood.

416
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And as a result,

417
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
people ended them for the Adam.

418
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, that's why the little sisters

419
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
are in so vulnerable.

420
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So the brainwashed guys and weapons

421
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
to protect the little sister,

422
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
and the guy talking to you in this level

423
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
is unresponsive.

424
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm going to keep him alive

425
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
because I'm trying to be nice.

426
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I don't like the heat.

427
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Wait, mommy.

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Quick, let me ink in your teeth first.

429
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Honey tea.

430
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, yeah, you want to give me honey tea?

431
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
No breed, only pregnant.

432
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, wait, no, I said that wrong.

433
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Only breed, no pregnant.

434
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The multiplayer in BioShock 2 is amazing.

435
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Wait, is this the line?

436
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Can I play BioShock 2 with you guys?

437
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
How is my Pog wafter?

438
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's amazing.

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I love that.

440
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Doesn't Pog mean fat ass white girl?

441
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Broly legend.

442
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Time for us all to ink so we get a chance.

443
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You have to wait until the 10th of October.

444
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Gotta make myself clear.

445
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You must hold until the 10th of October.

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you, Broly legend.

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Ink soon.

448
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Hello, Momay, how are you?

449
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yuppers, I think it is.

450
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

451
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Have you ever eaten squid ink pasta?

452
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I've known two months for feet.

453
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, you want feet bake?

454
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I already did feet.

455
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I did a whole shroom dedicated to feet.

456
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
My ripping my tights got clipped,

457
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
but I'm probably going to turn it into a short.

458
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Arisa's probably going to like her eyes are going to roll out of her skull

459
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
when I say that she'll be like, yeah, I know what you're doing.

460
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah, yeah.

461
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
According to your slimy dude, let me be clear.

462
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There's a few days after my older pals wedding,

463
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
man, everyone's getting married.

464
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What the fuck?

465
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's it.

466
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We just need to get married to show everyone up right now.

467
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But wait a minute.

468
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Hey, Momay, as refunds can clean the aftermath of the audio if you want,

469
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
did you like my panties?

470
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I got really embarrassed to actually show that picture,

471
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
but it's kind of, it's just what happens.

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I literally unironically inked myself.

473
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What's with the 10th of October?

474
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So the 10th of October is my birthday.

475
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

476
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Two months.

477
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Zarian.

478
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So long, sir.

479
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I never said thank you so long, sir.

480
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Our Zarian, thank you.

481
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Two months.

482
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Love you, Stranny.

483
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Love you.

484
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Strong so too.

485
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
No, not my strong so.

486
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I just remembered what it means.

487
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The pic was hot.

488
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
My birthday's the 10th of October,

489
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but my doughnathon isn't related to needing to move out or new PC parts

490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
or anything of that nature.

491
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
My doughnathon is related to hiring six more people to sexually harass with no HR.

492
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, yeah.

493
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Thank you, Rockstar, for the extended membership.

494
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I become a Rockstar.

495
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But yeah.

496
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If we go get married, let's do it.

497
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We do it live.

498
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
My doughnathon is related to the confirmation of Gen2's production

499
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
because it takes quite a very long time to make

500
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and it also costs a pretty penny as well.

501
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But that's for me too, Erin.

502
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Not for you to worry about.

503
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Vealer is simply just Stranny's harem.

504
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, shit.

505
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I say harem now because it's TV.

506
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
How am I even supposed to say...

507
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Thank you for becoming the extended membership.

508
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Stranny Hogs, Stranny Love Heart.

509
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Thanks again.

510
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
For the two month extended membership.

511
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Can I invest in Gen2?

512
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Every, you know, tip membership, et cetera,

513
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
actually is technically an investment into Gen2.

514
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm not even fucking kidding.

515
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
As for the clipping program.

516
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh my God, more leaks.

517
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Thank God I was drinking this cup of tea, more leaks.

518
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The clipping program.

519
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I, if my services are correct,

520
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and by services I mean management is communicated to me,

521
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
10 people have been contacted, please do check.

522
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Although one of you, who I won't be naming names,

523
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
didn't put your correct discord down.

524
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And I'm not sure how to navigate getting you added.

525
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I hope you follow, if you follow the main Vealer account,

526
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I can maybe get them to be in there.

527
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But one of you, that clips is often,

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
they didn't put down your correct discord ad,

529
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and management are like, what do we do now?

530
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And I'm like, well, you're gonna have to deal with it.

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Whoever you are.

532
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't know if I'm allowed to name them.

533
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
They clip the girls often.

534
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
If you guys come up with a name, I'll confirm it.

535
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
How about that?

536
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Something, something, did a highlight reel of all

537
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
a ridiculous collapse.

538
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
There, do you know who it is now?

539
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
For those of you who watched all the highlight

540
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
of those who come up with this stuff.

541
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But yes, 10 people have been contacted.

542
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's gonna be trialed for a month.

543
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
We're gonna see what that, fondle a bosom.

544
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You know what, you're done.

545
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Wait, the leak.

546
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Ink vesters, if you will, true.

547
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I almost choked on my tea.

548
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
All right, who's ready to go into the rapture?

549
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Me, me, I'm ready to go into the rapture.

550
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I can't wait.

551
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Right, this game is...

552
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Oh, my controller said, hold on.

553
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I need to put my controller back online.

554
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Excuse me right now.

555
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
She's leaking information as much as she's leaking ink.

556
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Somebody plug that home.

557
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Someone said that, they really plug that home

558
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
and I'm like, excuse you.

559
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
This is literally where I leaked from.

560
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Where else am I supposed to leak from?

561
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay, we're good, we're good.

562
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Thank you, the beauty lord, for the super chat.

563
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Right, you're ready.

564
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, every 10 minutes, you must say,

565
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Shawnee, save.

566
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Okay, now I am, just for those of you who didn't

567
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
catch up with yesterday's stream, please don't worry.

568
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I have accidentally played this full section before.

569
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I bet you've forgotten it all.

570
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh, God, I feel like a noob again.

571
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh, God, it's been so long.

572
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
We did play, but unfortunately, the game crashed

573
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
right at the end of the mission

574
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and did not remember a single thing.

575
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Hold on.

576
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Right, so they're fully leveled up, that's fine.

577
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Are you squidding me right now?

578
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh, my God.

579
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm ready for Shawnee to rapture me.

580
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Rapture's all over you.

581
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Okay.

582
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Okay, unfortunately, ooh.

583
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Right, let's scavenge, scavenge him.

584
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Give me all them bullets.

585
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Give me that.

586
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Give me that tommy gun bullets.

587
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I picked up caliber rounds.

588
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Right, sorry, let me just get a little familiar again.

589
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
My apologies.

590
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh, my God, I'm ready for Shawnee to rapture me.

591
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Did I pop your cherry?

592
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Dragon Karma, thank you for your cherry.

593
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yoinkers, my no.

594
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Okay, right, let's scavenge what we can.

595
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We got armor, piercing rounds, 20.

596
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That was actually very worth it.

597
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Right, okay.

598
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, wait, hold on.

599
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
What did I say?

600
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Oh, please hurry, Daddy.

601
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Anyway, let's just grab this real quick.

602
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Are you a master of research?

603
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Get the most out of your damage while you research.

604
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh, no, I've lost all my little slots.

605
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Oh, no, I forgot.

606
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I forgot.

607
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh, right.

608
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Okay, we're being introduced to the lab.

609
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Hello.

610
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
My name is Gilbert Alexander.

611
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Hello, we received a call about a serious leaking problem.

612
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Where's the problem?

613
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Where's the Mario Brothers?

614
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Thank you, Mario Brothers, for being concerned about my leakage problem.

615
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I can't believe you lost all your slots.

616
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
What?

617
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I know.

618
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
What happened last stream?

619
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Unfortunately, the game crashed right at the end of the level.

620
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm going to look for slugs.

621
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Oh, my goodness.

622
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I didn't recall.

623
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm looking for slugs.

624
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Eat slots.

625
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
That's a really particular reference.

626
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay, we picked up 10, Adam, for grabbing that.

627
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Hi, Adam.

628
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Sorry, I just want to mess with you so badly if you're called Adam right now.

629
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Everyone's like, man, I wish the video game was my first legal name.

630
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And then everyone's like, there'll be like one refling called Isaac.

631
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And they're like, oh, do you want to play Binding of Isaac?

632
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh, I know you're so addicted to it.

633
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm sure you want to play Binding of Isaac.

634
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Isaac, Isaac, Isaac.

635
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What other games?

636
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
There's other characters called, I'm sorry.

637
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm just looking around for slugs.

638
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Okay, I got one slug.

639
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I think that's all we're getting out of this little adventure.

640
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
30 minutes lost, but 30 minutes.

641
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Well, I was worried in case you didn't want to play.

642
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I was going to play this offline, so I wasn't repeating myself,

643
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
but maybe we can do a bit better this time around.

644
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Sorry, I'm getting very scared.

645
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
We're already saving teeth.

646
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Okay, right.

647
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
So we're going to be introduced to this naughty, naughty robot.

648
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And he's so naughty.

649
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And he's getting farted on.

650
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We've got a hacked art.

651
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So anyway, do you want to look?

652
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Hi, Isaac, are you going to bind me up?

653
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Hi.

654
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Are you glitched out?

655
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Nope.

656
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You're fired.

657
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
No, I'm not.

658
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm a cute little worker.

659
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
See.

660
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Okay, there's a bit of a fight in this room, but that's okay.

661
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I'm ready.

662
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Where did she go?

663
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Where'd she go?

664
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't know how to cancel the electricity.

665
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh, there you go.

666
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It was the other bumper.

667
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No, not me.

668
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm so confused.

669
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
I have played this.

670
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Oh, my God.

671
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
My stream got copyright yesterday, by the way.

672
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Because of a 10 second fragmented audio.

673
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And I swear if it's because of that teleprompter.

674
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Whoa.

675
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Have we researched these guys?

676
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Oh, we haven't.

677
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Right.

678
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Get the rivet gun out.

679
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That telekinesis?

680
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
How the fuck do I have telekinesis?

681
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't use telekinesis.

682
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Okay, I've already researched everyone here.

683
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Okay, so I'm starting to understand the research.

684
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I've got playing games.

685
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This game audio always breaks my brain.

686
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Is it too loud?

687
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Are we all happy?

688
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Actually, I need to stop using the ice because the ice means I can't scavenge their corpses.

689
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And it's putting me at detriment.

690
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, my money.

691
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

692
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
My apologies.

693
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay, right.

694
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
We're not going to do that.

695
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
We're going to do this.

696
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Alex, the great.

697
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, hell, that has to be Gil Alexander.

698
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Same man who left that message we're following.

699
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
He sounds mad as a March Hare now.

700
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's always a gamble.

701
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Is that my foot?

702
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Oh, sorry.

703
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I thought there was a big daddy.

704
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I've got a shotgun box.

705
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I do.

706
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
We're going to muck about with shotguns a little bit.

707
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh, I forgot about this.

708
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Oh, yeah.

709
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
This is that anticlimactic fight.

710
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So they actually did make this part easy in the game.

711
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But then the rest of the game is super hard.

712
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Stranny, when you kill them while frozen,

713
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
they drop boxes with their loot in it.

714
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I never saw the boxes.

715
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I can't seem to find that box when they're frozen.

716
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It must go to Spain because I can't even find it.

717
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Wait, in infinite, there's a part where the girls love to have fun.

718
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Excuse me?

719
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
What happens in infinite?

720
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
In Bioshock Infinite?

721
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Is there a scene that we need to see?

722
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, it's the big bad man.

723
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
He's coming.

724
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
When they freeze, they drop nothing.

725
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
That's awful.

726
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Oh, I don't have any of those.

727
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm just spamming this.

728
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Ooh, increased damage.

729
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The Alpha series is vulnerable to armor-fiercing rounds.

730
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, yeah.

731
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Okay, I'm getting slightly better, dare I declare.

732
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Wait, what do you mean I'm really confident playing this section

733
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
because I've actually played it before?

734
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What? No!

735
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What do you mean I'm so cocky now because I've played this section?

736
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What?

737
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
No, that's crazy.

738
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm always the same when I play games, okay?

739
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Me or cocky now because then it comes up again.

740
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Only a room that will copyright this stream.

741
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Literally, I had a tent.

742
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The stream was six hours long and YouTube's like,

743
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
sorry, ineligible and all that.

744
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I have been exposed to a massive dose of substance addict.

745
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
By the time you hear this, I will live on.

746
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Wait, no, I don't need to take that out to hack it though.

747
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh my God, that's so skinny.

748
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Penetrate?

749
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You're actually really okay now because I know what to do.

750
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Save every 10 minutes.

751
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay, you'll need to tell me when...

752
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Hey, hey, hey, Krusty Kram.

753
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Hey, hey, hey.

754
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Okay, look at this.

755
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
She even made the same joke.

756
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That old Mayra reminded me of...

758
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Shoot to her.

759
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
What? Jesse passed away?

760
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
From Pokemon?

761
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
From what? She must have been so young.

762
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Okay, I'm going to save his reservoir head.

763
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Misty?

764
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Oh, cancer for fuck's sake, man.

765
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Jesse and Misty was the same voice actress.

766
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I didn't even know.

767
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Sorry, I'm going to scavenge while the gameplay happens.

768
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Basically, we're being locked out by him

769
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
because he won't let us talk in the same time.

770
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
So I'm just scavenging.

771
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Hi, hi, Misty.

772
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Thanks for joining.

773
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We're just assisting the passing of the Pokemon V.

774
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Cancer took both the Japanese and English views.

775
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
All I'm saying is that when they finally come out

776
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
with the microplastic reports,

777
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
it's all I'm saying.

778
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
All I'm saying is that's actually so fucking cool.

779
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Sorry, but cancer is absolutely alright.

780
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
See if you can find some way to sabotage his control

781
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
of building security.

782
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Security?

783
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I like when I'm called Delta.

784
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Damn right, I'm Big D.

785
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm Big Delta.

786
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, I'll be your daddy tonight.

787
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
55 is like incredibly young.

788
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Incredibly young.

789
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Hmm.

790
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Okay, right, we've got a bubble, so that's fine.

791
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
We're going to grab this little chickadee.

792
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We're going to make her a problem.

793
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Where are you? Up here or down here?

794
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Hi, pumpkin space.

795
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm not mean.

796
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
I'm mean there, motherfucker.

797
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Sorry, hold on. Let me get a picture real quick.

798
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Let me get a picture.

799
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Oh wait, not a rivet. The spear is better, I think.

800
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Oh, this is that fanny that puts down

801
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
all those little turret things.

802
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Okay, hold on, hold on.

803
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm getting brave. I'm getting cocky

804
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
because I've played this section before.

805
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm getting cocky.

806
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Okay, we're just going to screw him down.

807
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Whoa! Not too cocky, not too cocky.

808
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm a fucking caliber.

809
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Fucking hell.

810
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
All right, pumpkin, you know what I hate.

811
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
On you go.

812
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
There was a Japanese V that was 55 in English.

813
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
What the fuck in the hell? What's going on?

814
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't want to see the algae space.

815
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

816
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I need you to pick up some atom for me, darling.

817
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay, right.

818
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Yes, you are correct, right.

819
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You be a doll and grab that as fast as you possibly can

820
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and then I'm going to get tons of good stuff for it, okay?

821
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yes, yes, yes, angel, angel.

822
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That's great, kid, don't get cocky.

823
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Literally worse than Star Wars and out here.

824
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We actually need to watch Star Wars, you know that.

825
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Should we watch on May 4th?

826
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Oh, no, I was going to play LEGO.

827
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

828
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Star Wars?

829
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Should we watch on May 4th?

830
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Maybe we should just watch the movies on May 4th.

831
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Bob and Weave, Momay, Bob and Weave.

832
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I'm trying so hard, Miroa.

833
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Thank you for the extended membership.

834
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Literally suckin' stuff.

835
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Fucking bad.

836
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
How did I keep accidentally...

837
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Great, okay, that's one.

838
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh, what was that?

839
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, that is what I want.

840
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I need to try and get him

841
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
and then I can do more damage against him and...

842
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Oh, sorry, I'm doing a bit of rubbish.

843
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I maybe should have bought some...

844
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Animal bullets!

845
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Animal bullets!

846
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
No!

847
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Why did he just accept that?

848
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Honestly.

849
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It had literally just some...

850
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and cruise damage.

851
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's what I want to see, baby!

852
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Leave her alone.

853
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
She's main to deal with.

854
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
She's mine, not yours!

855
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Ugh!

856
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Wait, hold on.

857
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Hold on!

858
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Hold on.

859
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I'm literally...

860
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm getting all these upgrades

861
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
because I didn't understand the mechanics.

862
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But now I do.

863
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm learning.

864
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Okay, the angel's done.

865
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That's good, darling.

866
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Oh, my God!

867
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
What was that?

868
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Okay, you get on my back, darling.

869
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Nicely so.

870
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Death Jar Jar.

871
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Okay, there is one more

872
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
but we're going to scavenge a little bit.

873
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We just need to pick up more ammo.

874
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, see, those boxes do get left behind.

875
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
But the other stuff doesn't seem to like it so much.

876
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Mummy would drill well for the heavens.

877
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well, I do have a frozen...

878
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
benefit to my...

879
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
my gun.

880
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
If that's looking at me.

881
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
There we go.

882
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Oh, I've got a few bullets off of that.

883
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000

1052
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,020
How about you sir? No, he's positively rigid

1053
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,980
Make a more it is

1054
00:57:54,180 --> 00:58:00,940
So more professional than YouTube literally YouTube broke everything my redirects haven't been working my thumbnails have been bugging out

1055
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,740
my

1056
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,740
Just everything

1057
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,740
What what happened? Why did you go in the stratosphere?

1058
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,820
Why did you do that? I don't know why she did that

1059
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,340
Hold on hold on hold on

1060
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,620
Where's she going?

1061
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:52,660
Got you

1062
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,260
Oh, I'm out. Sorry. I'm out right hold on don't move

1063
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,900
Natural camouflage. What the fuck this is

1064
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:06,460
No, I don't need natural camouflage. No, I did not share with a rocket launcher. Are you joking?

1065
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,380
Oh

1066
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:17,940
What's going on, I think they're like walking on that and the physics are gonna freeze

1067
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,500
Behold physics you broke the game again you rolled ragdolter right she's supposed to tell

1068
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,140
Now

1069
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,460
Delta's gonna faint like a big daddy

1070
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,220
Physics it's more of a suggestion in this game than anything else

1071
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,740
Absolutely warped is our soul

1072
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,900
Yeah

1073
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,860
You couldn't stand when we stuck you into that get up

1074
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,420
Give me more freebies

1075
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,500
Right we did it I'm not just eat for free

1076
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:29,900
And then we'll scavenge and pick up all our loot because we got loads of loot from these guys

1077
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,020
I

1078
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,540
Don't use the first aid kit

1079
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:41,020
I'm pretty sure the week alpha is supposed to be target practice for multiplayer

1080
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,860
What was the multiplayer like did you go against the like in-game stuff for?

1081
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,740
There's it more right you're shining as soon as I do that

1082
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,740
I

1083
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,380
Just look everything I blow that up to smithereens

1084
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,260
Now just look all these people. Thank you for dying

1085
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,980
That helps me survive in my quest

1086
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:15,740
Okay, next we need to

1087
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,580
Deal with anyone that's respond

1088
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:29,620
Is it upstairs now? Okay destroy the signal the offices are off to the left of the marketing department, which I believe is upstairs. I

1089
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:35,060
Really wish they didn't have to be spawned everything

1090
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:46,820
How am I heartless bro, I'm not done anything stop it you're telling fibbers. I'm not heartless

1091
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,820
I

1092
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,740
Can show you what heartless group really looks like

1093
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,460
Save save oh shit, sorry

1094
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:03,740
Sorry, sorry. I'm getting so I'm still getting into it's cuz I know kind of what to do. I'm like, oh, yeah, I can do this

1095
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,740
Oh, yeah, mr. Cram

1096
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,940
Okay, there's a little thing to pick up here

1097
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:23,940
Have I maxed out okay, I've maxed out on the teleport people as well. Can you take your gun out please?

1098
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:38,800
Maybe this game isn't as hard as I first thought it was and it was because I'm actually just a brain lit

1099
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,260
And I just wasn't doing it right, but I'm I'm calm for handing

1100
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:51,020
Actually quite enjoy the the like photograph system makes you like stronger against the enemies. I think that's like a really nice detail

1101
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,100
Ah, I remember

1102
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,420
Mummy's learning it only took me what seven hours of playing the game and being right at the end

1103
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,420
Mm-hmm

1104
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,780
I'll let it spark again and then I'll spray it down

1105
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,940
Sinclair

1106
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,420
Fuck you bitch

1107
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,420
I

1108
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:42,300
Was Gavin Jim we get on the dollar now that your program are having learning understood the mechanic yet literally

1109
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:49,540
Oh, it took me what six hours. I don't know why like because you guys were telling me like oh, this is how it works

1110
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:55,180
But I don't know it just takes my brain like longer to comprehend something. I hope that's understandable

1111
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,180
like in a sentence

1112
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:00,180
but

1113
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:07,220
Like it does it just takes me a bit longer and I think because I slept on it like I slept on the the fact toys of

1114
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,900
Like oh, this is how this game mechanic works

1115
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,420
Yeah, you basically didn't want to understand the game rushed everything I

1116
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:27,300
Don't know if I'm supposed to mess with this. I think I really let me touch it much I

1117
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:36,260
Guess if I chase it, it'll actually give me the reward for it's like a passive teleport thing. It's my guess

1118
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,540
Oh, I just look shocked. I got scared from it. I

1119
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:49,580
Like the hand detail as well when you got like fire and you did well regardless of me being a brain

1120
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,700
You still

1121
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,700
Have a nice swap into telekinesis, I don't

1122
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,180
They hear a daddy I

1123
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,820
Don't hear the Wayne so

1124
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,260
That's me. I'm hearing my own first step. I'm like

1125
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,540
That was a bit close to think

1126
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,540
I

1127
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:28,180
Hear something jingling

1128
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:36,660
We'll keep the shotgun out for a little bit I can hear this here blow it up to smithereens go complete

1129
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,300
Okay, what can we scavenge from the death?

1130
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,220
Oh

1131
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,100
More alcohol

1132
01:05:54,180 --> 01:06:00,620
Okay, he blew up because he's super angry at me, but we can go into the others like first aid kit

1133
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:10,140
Okay, I grabbed it. Oh it's safe. Oh, there's two. There's three. Oh, no

1134
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:18,340
Okay, I'm not doing that again, so I'm not like it as a game. Okay, we did it

1135
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,500
She was on any percent speed one that takes pro skills

1136
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,140
Okay, I'm quite sad

1137
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:35,340
Maybe I'll pull out the old caliber the old ball and chain caliber since it's literally the best thing ever

1138
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:47,340
Oh, you're mistaken miss lamp, right? I'm no tire and I'm the protector of little sisters spawner

1139
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,500
Well, the purchase a few more caliber

1140
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,260
To literally spring down with that gun

1141
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,700
I'm no time. I don't even know why I'm here. You know what? I just woke up here 10 years later

1142
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,700
Be nice to me. Okay. I'm a bit disorientated

1143
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,580
F11 is quicksave if this grant

1144
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:30,220
Failed to load the quicksave your mother imagine if I got teleported back because of your fanny and about young man

1145
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,520
I fell for your prank. I trusted you

1146
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:44,820
You almost killed us you almost killed us

1147
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,460
There's a switch in here

1148
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:02,780
Okay, now we get to go to the letter our border for it really you my labor it's sorry

1149
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,020
I don't know where I'm supposed to go. I'm just following the arrow

1150
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:18,940
I'm not taking HP damage for this

1151
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,620
Help me five two five four

1152
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:55,300
What I'm not sure I want to take it but you taught vending machine well, I mean I guess

1153
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,340
What is this

1154
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,300
Five

1155
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,220
I

1156
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,100
Not a slave. I'm a big daddy

1157
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:35,860
I can be your daddy. It doesn't really work like that. I think I can be your mommy though

1158
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:49,220
That was very strange, I did appear to actually take damage from that fate that wasn't really a fate, but I'm not mattering. Oh

1159
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,740
He's trying to scare me because it's working

1160
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,860
Someone is angry at me. Oh

1161
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,380
That's right. They all kept coming down here, but they wouldn't leave me alone. Oh

1162
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
No, they're fully

1163
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:22,580
Okay, there's quite a lot of enemies that are gonna come down this corridor if I remember correctly

1164
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:26,580
You already are her description of attire appears to me. Am I the baddie?

1165
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,780
Wait, I didn't pay attention too much

1166
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,420
Do you want to be the baddie?

1167
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,100
I can make you play the bad guy

1168
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,820
Oh, no missy. What am I gonna do?

1169
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:47,860
You won't let me escape without giving you something. You need some information from me

1170
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:55,380
Why are you so close?

1171
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:01,380
You need to calm them

1172
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,220
Can I progress or am I still in trouble?

1173
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:16,260
Why does it keep going to telekinesis? I'm not telling it to wait bumblebee. Where did you come from?

1174
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,340
Are you okay?

1175
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,340
Hey

1176
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:24,340
Are you okay buddy?

1177
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:30,340
What happened? I don't even know where you went for half the map your map problem now, though

1178
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,340
I'm quite happy of it

1179
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:38,260
Stardays over using the 50 cal and the alphas is written for them. I need to swap to shotgun instead

1180
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,260
Okay, I will remember that next thing

1181
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,340
I do have frag grenades at least

1182
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,220
You

1183
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,900
They tracked you down literally only took the whole game for them to find me

1184
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,820
Yes

1185
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,540
Don't start with me woman. I have a family

1186
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:13,780
And I don't know that's my favorite thing

1187
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:20,740
It's literally my favorite thing when you guys are like I was literally about to go for like dinner or like I was literally about to

1188
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:26,500
Go shopping and I need to wait for it to go away. That's my favorite fucking thing. Sorry, but I'm so happy

1189
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,060
Bye bumblebee. Thank you for your service

1190
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:36,100
Hey, thank you the very lord for the super jet 10 minutes of time wait. Are you guys got timers on your

1191
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,660
Like and or something

1192
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:42,740
You must have a timer on your end. You're so efficient. Right. We're gonna look for some

1193
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,300
Um

1194
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:52,500
Mummy keeps her reeflings at home to keep them aroused the whole time literally I'll go outside for you

1195
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,980
You can live the perfect knee. I'll make you chicken

1196
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:59,300
Nuggets every night. Is there a slog around here?

1197
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,580
No, uh, oh maybe

1198
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,220
No, that's just coral. Um

1199
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:12,900
And I feed you and then I give you a smart every night to fall asleep too and give you body massages

1200
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,500
When you're soaring tired. I didn't okay. I actually didn't see any

1201
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:23,940
I don't think there's any slugs this time. I think I don't think they always put a slug in the outside map

1202
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:26,020
So I guess we'll just go for it

1203
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,980
Good thing it's already evening in the EU

1204
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:37,380
I can watch with a stiffy in the comfort mode home. That's amazing

1205
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:44,580
Right, is there a slug? I feel like there should be a slug. Oh, I could have scavenged him. Sorry

1206
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,460
I can like fully breathe under war, right?

1207
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,620
I'm not gonna cause any problems dilly dallying

1208
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,780
I was at me to be born to

1209
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:01,460
As I recall from my time to a business with the owners is that oxy fill station out

1210
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:09,860
There's just a front for a kind of hidden passage leading down below if lambs hide an eleno from you. That's where she'll be

1211
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:14,100
I can't eat. Sorry. I don't see any slugs this time

1212
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,540
But

1213
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:23,300
I feel like they would put it really obvious like they wouldn't want to hate it that much from you

1214
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,660
Yeah, okay. I don't think there was a sluggy one here this time, but that's okay

1215
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,620
Okay

1216
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:39,540
Asa my roleplay of you taking care of okay. Yeah, don't ask for like a nice cozy roleplay not absolutely

1217
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,980
No questions

1218
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,500
Why do I not like this I can't seem to recall

1219
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:53,940
It appears I am rather terrified of what follows

1220
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,260
Oh god, he's giving me news

1221
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,620
Wait, what happens? Okay, I think it's safe until the lights come on

1222
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:10,580
Okay, I'm afraid the lights in here sting my eyes

1223
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:16,180
It's safe until the lights come on it's safe until the lights come on it's safe until the lights come on

1224
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:24,980
I'm one of the lights for here. Okay, I can do it. I can do it. It's okay. I'm allowed to be scared

1225
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:30,820
I'm allowed to be terrified. I'm allowed to be mortified and what the fuck is going on in that chamber. It's okay

1226
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,660
Okay, there we go

1227
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,740
Okay, I'm allowed to be scared I'm allowed to be scared

1228
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:56,180
So fear and I knew up here. I didn't look at him properly. Don't touch the glass. We needed someone to be host to all that

1229
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:59,380
Just running on fun taking care of 20th anniversary

1230
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,340
Sounds like a fun time to me

1231
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,780
Can you try pressing f12?

1232
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:12,660
Oh, wow it does work. Okay f12

1233
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:18,500
Whatever you may have seen inside the tank that was indeed me

1234
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:24,100
I didn't see it. I'm afraid of Eleanor Lamb will be less physical, but no less grotesque

1235
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,380
This tank for deep sea life is the ideal way to

1236
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:34,180
Dispose of me, but first you must retrieve enough adam infused plant life to rule me out

1237
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,460
The slugs feed on the stuff and it's all

1238
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,020
Why are you thanking me? You're helping me. No crash

1239
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,740
Sample here, so you know what to look for

1240
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,940
Okay, so I need some flowers

1241
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,580
I can do that

1242
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:02,260
Oh, not good obliot obliot obliot

1243
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,500

1244
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,180
Didn't uh, I recorded him. What?

1245
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:16,020
I recorded him. I didn't even hurt him myself. Wait, they're fanning each other

1246
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,860
I don't did you mean to do that? I don't think he did

1247
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,860
Is

1248
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:34,340
I think they hurt each other and I got the benefit of it

1249
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:45,300
Okay, get to Eleanor you're gonna need one from alex the great in there first things first we got a pin down

1250
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:48,900
Find those plants he mentioned and lure him back out

1251
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:54,820
Oh

01:17:55,220 --> 01:18:00,020
Wait, these are teleport guys. No, right. I fully leveled up. I just need the other

1253
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:07,220

1254
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,940

1255
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,660
Alpha can you one

1256

Um, sorry, that was I don't know why I said that unprompted. Whoa, what do you mean? Whoa, whoa, stop

1257
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:27,140
He's fucking scaring me. Jesus. I didn't even see it

1258
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:32,100
Oh

1259
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,180
No, that was a way back up wait

1260
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,380
No, it is this way

1261
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:45,540
Sorry, I just remembered that little mean thing god. Why have I been so bad right? Okay, that's fine. I'm always gonna do that

1262
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:51,060
Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I come in here and then the game pretends that I'm allowed to leave

1263
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,060
prank

1264
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:56,740
Get pranked. I'm not allowed to leave. Oh my god. I got pranked so hard

1265
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:00,340
With the heck I must just grab it. Oh, it's shining

1266
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:06,340
Uh, it's got it's also got an audio cue and you know how it's like big and violently, you know glowing. Yeah

1267
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,380
Oh, no, I'm so surprised

1268
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:13,220
Just for those who are coming in I have played this my game unfortunately crashed

1269
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,900
So I don't know what's coming up just for this level though. I don't know what happens

1270
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,940
Does anyone need a photo taken of them, please be honest with me. I can't

1271
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,060
Yeah, nice try mate

1272
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,980
Nice try

1273
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,740
Oh, he threw a knee at me

1274
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:52,020
Give me all those supplies right now

1275
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:04,180
Poor things what a life marching around playing daddy until some splice of manage to kill off their sister

1276
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:09,380
And then if the coma doesn't take them they turn maniac just like a tourist trap

1277
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:11,860
I'm trying to take a picture and sell it to you

1278
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:15,460
We better get you to elinor on the double

1279
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,340
Crank of john begins to tear itself apart

1280
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:28,260
The compulsion to find elinor will drive you to madness or coma

1281
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:33,220
I'm sorry for what happens next little one. It's nothing personal

1282
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,780
Greatest sense

1283
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:43,620
And yet you persist. Oh, I'm persistent. All right. I'm fucking persistent. All right

1284
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,540
It's okay pumpkin spaces, okay

1285
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,300
I'm you'll feel a hell of a lot better once I'm

1286
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,980
Got you what you want

1287
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,380
All right, you do your thing. We'll go get the other body

1288
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:10,180
Yes angel, yes

1289
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:12,180
careful

1290
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,740
They are gonna come over honeypot, but just

1291
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:19,940
Set up traps. I probably should but never fall though

1292
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:24,180
Like I feel like by the time I'm finished right up

1293
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:28,900
No, they're fully done. So it's just like daddies that are attached to

1294
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,540
Little sisters that

1295
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,820
Hear them

1296
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:47,460
It's probably worse when I can directionally hear the enemy, but I don't see them like that

1297
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:53,160
Subsequently actually like worse

1298
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:01,860
Like I

1299
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,460
I think I'm going to have to upgrade to fire safe

1300
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:22,660
Unzip them just to say the last interest in terminology. I did a bit more than unzip the enemies

1301
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,540
I make them feel real different. All right

1302
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,860
I

1303
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:41,940
Nice try buddy get the fuck out of here. Oh my god, that's so disorientating when they do that

1304
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:56,180
Are you done darlin can you hurry up and chug chug your cola you're taking a fucking what saying darlin

1305
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,860
Ah

1306
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,980
I'm trying I'm trying

1307
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:10,900
Okay, maybe I should have stayed up traps. I can't whoa. Why did my aim just blew up?

1308
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:15,220
I can't believe the reeflings were right again. I should have stayed up

1309
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,260
Get out of here

1310
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:24,180
Okay, she's chugging her cola that's good

1311
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:35,220
Oh, you're a pumpkin space geez my goodness

1312
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:41,380
I hear like

1313
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,180
They hear lots of brolling that isn't

1314
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:55,380
Right I seem to have a lot of rivets so maybe I should start using this a bit more

1315
01:23:56,340 --> 01:24:02,740
Although it's kind of a pump pump pump, you know, and I'm more of a give me the route to shoot

1316
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,980
All right, where's your next body

1317
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,460
Uh, I don't but I'm glad you do because like

1318
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:20,340
All right, I was gonna say where are you taking me right? It's back in here. Okay. I will set up traps

1319
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:22,580
I

1320
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,780
Okay, let's do what here

1321
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,820
Here here

1322
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,660
Ah

1323
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:42,100
Nope, you're fine. You're safe. Uh, I really wish they didn't I probably that's the only thing

1324
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:48,500
I don't like about these kind of games is it really should be they don't respawn in the area that you've cleared out

1325
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,460
because that implies they're like climbing around or

1326
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:57,140
Doing something rather obtuse. I guess how I would describe it

1327
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,980
Right surely that's enough surely that's enough fucking pre

1328
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,860
Put down traps, right?

1329
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,660
Copium I bet you they're all gonna come the wrong way

1330
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:11,940
Hi, I see. Hi snowberries

1331
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:19,460
We're playing, um bioshock we have we're replaying a section because unfortunately my game bugged out

1332
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:25,060
Uh, we're just playing a section. We're just getting a little sister to get as much adam as she wants

1333
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,140
Um

1334
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,100
Is this the

1335
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,100
Hope you guys are doing okay

1336
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:42,340
I'm I'm fortunately I'm not very good at this game. So I'm very distracted in terms of communication

1337
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:46,820
But I hope I see had a fantastic stream. I actually don't know what she was doing today

1338
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:51,220
Uh, I saw her tweet out about the

1339
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:58,180
Something exciting which I'm not spoiling but I saw her tweet about it and she's really happy about it and she's happy

1340
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:01,060
I'm happy. So I hope you guys are looking forward to that

1341
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,700
Unless she said what it was

1342
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,100
Sorry, give me just a second

1343
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,100
God

1344
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:22,180
I'm oh, jeez

1345
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,460

1346
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:32,340
Okay, she got a cooler right time to take you back home. All right

Are we gonna be together again daddy? She was sharing her stalker story

1348
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:39,620
I see

1349
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,620

Is everything okay daddy's a messenger. Is she okay or is she like giggling at a

1351
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:54,180
She'll probably want to save after putting the losses. Yeah, in case the

1352
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:57,060
Sponsor

1353
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:07,940
Let me scavenge everything right f12 to save okay, and then away you go home

1354
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,460
He later earlier

1355
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,700
In a while crocodile

1356
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:21,060
She was mercy when she was a teenager. Okay. Oh, she was laughing. I see. I mean if you cook this

Yeah, I'll make a yander short of her

1358
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:29,460
The girls are whispering father. They've left you a present at the gatherers garden

1359
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:33,540
Take it that's full of money. I think I'm actually full of money

I'm trying to like scavenge everything, but it's like you're full. You're full

1361
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:40,660
No quiet. No quiet

Oh, you managed right you manage. Okay, she's safe. I'm satisfied

Okay, you see there's an animation here

1371
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:21,460
Ian you manage him everything arrives precisely when he needs to okay, she's safe

1372
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:33,460
Uh, I think this is why I'd rather put inferno on right if my money

1373
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:35,460
Eh

1374
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:55,140
What

1375
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:01,700
What

1376
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:09,140
I just wanted to buy some stuff from that machine, but I guess no what the fuck

1377
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:15,700
If you're a little helper keeps getting an interrupt tell him to get a move on with demanding father

1378
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:22,420
Man she gives a ton of books. What 300 Adam

1379
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,460
Real is unlocked

1380
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:29,220
We need one more and then that's fully unlocked. Okay

1381
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,940
We can do

1382
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:38,740
Incinerate, I don't know. I'm kind of I'm a bit biased towards incinerate right now, but I actually don't have enough any 300

1383
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:52,020
Every time we hack you keen stuff tiger parenting honestly though

1384
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,500
I

1385
01:29:54,820 --> 01:30:00,180
Didn't even need plastic like I hardly swap between them. I like

1386
01:30:02,980 --> 01:30:08,980
I don't know if I'm better just piling it into right. I'll do incinerate too because that does damage over time, which I really like

1387
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:12,500
I know ice is okay. I'll take off spirit man

1388
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:16,500
Um, then we'll just do even health. I guess

1389
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:24,180
If it's the wrong choice, I do apologize, but you are watching someone play the game for the first time to suck morsel

1390
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,820
I don't know what you want. I don't know what you want from me. I don't know what is going on there

1391
01:30:29,220 --> 01:30:32,500
I just want to hack this machine and buy stuff from it

1392
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:41,140
This is buyout

1393
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:50,820
Okay, I have developed a new set of behavioral constraints. Dr. Alexander will live to promote the common good

1394
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:56,260
His love and loyalty shall be spread evenly across the entire human race

1395
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:00,660
For me that is discipline at great personal cost

1396
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,380
For him at last

1397
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,860
It will be instinct

1398
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:08,100
Can we get my belt?

1399
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:13,700
Right, we have incinerate too. Let's see how we do that. I might get walloped in the back by that twat behind us, but

1400
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,060
Before you all right

1401
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,060
Okay

1402
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:30,580
I see it anti-personnel rose. Hmm. Let me save before entering this room

1403
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,300
I

1404
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,420
What is dr. Lam yapping about goddamn?

1405
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,740
I can't remember what happened

1406
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:47,940
Yeah, I do like the damage over time that

1407
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:58,580
Did she dive into the water to unfire herself?

1408
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:01,140
Sorry, that wasn't an english thing

1409
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:11,540
Oh, it's a fucking ball under here. I remember now

1410
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:23,220
An a plus for that that was bizarre she dived into the

1411
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:27,380
To go so I can't believe it. They didn't make these the most

1412
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:33,060
Easiest enemies in game. I'm so insolent right now. There's these log under here. Be honest

1413
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:36,420
Oh

1414
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,300
There's a bubbles here

1415
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:47,620
I'ma just let them clear out mr. Bubbles first

1416
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:51,540
Can I get points for them attacking him?

1417
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:57,460
Oh, wow, I can if he takes damage by them it counts as me giving them damage

1418
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,260
Oh wait, I think you guys said I was using this too much

1419
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:20,980
I can't fucking see shape don't worry if you can't see nothing else because I can't see nothing either

1420
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:23,380
I

1421
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:26,260
Can't see nothing that I pumpkin spice

1422
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,580
That big daddy has a audio diary the one back there

1423
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,620
Oh, he's well

1424
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:48,260
Two birds one

1425
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:53,780
I'll let her capture it and then I'll go in my inventory to listen to the audio log. That's how it works, right?

1426
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,140
Sorry, I can have done that

1427
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,000
It's a shit. It's a shit. Sorry

1428
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,240
Oh

1429
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:19,320
Stop going in the water. What the heck me like all fires amazing also me when they actually act like their own fire

1430
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:28,680
I love that fray unzip them just like I'll unzip your bowls

1431
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,120
She can't get put on fire right no

1432
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,800
Oh

1433
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,120
Whoa, what what?

1434
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,760
You're scaring me

1435
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:57,400
I can hear someone behind the door the violence intensified they are this one time

1436
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:02,520
No, I'm the one who controls the fire

1437
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:07,320
I'm sorry

1438
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,120
Why is the music so intense?

1439
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Well, I can hear him. Yeah

1440
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Oh

1441
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,760
Whoa, sorry, I didn't expect another

1442
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,080
Okay, I seem ow

1443
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,320
Is that everything

1444
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:48,360
I don't

1445
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,360
I

1446
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:55,240
If you shock the splicers the little sisters sometimes say that they're dancing. Oh, that's cute

1447
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,320
Is that good

1448
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,480
Are you telling them I'm the best daddy ever that's cute

1449
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,640
All right, well, let me in the food. Oh, I can hear the sunflower look can you hear the tingles?

1450
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:20,920
All right, I'm going to scavenge very quickly because that's quite a lot of enemies gala enemies

1451
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,040
But we're doing it like we're actually

1452
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:30,680
I don't I don't know where darlin back that way. Okay. We'll go get we'll grab it. We'll grab it in a minute. Give us a sec

1453
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,640
Give us a sec

1454
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,040
Um

1455
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:41,480
I hate to be cocky, but I think I think I understand the mechanics now. I can't believe it

1456
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,040
I feel confident

1457
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,120
Is that another daddy?

1458
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,920
Is he supposed to spawn there?

1459
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,720
I'm no touching them

1460
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,820
I've still got a girl on me

1461
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,720
As it happens. Okay, so

1462
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,920
Um

1463
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,400
I guess we'll just go with it. I mean sure

1464
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,600
Maybe mr. Bubbles might help

1465
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:31,960
Right, I'll let her do that. I'll get rid of her. I'll save and then I'll grab the other one too

1466
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,080
Whoa

1467
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,560
Well, there's the hiding hold it

No, no, I'm in a fight. You were the only I'm in a fight

01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:06,280
No, no, I'll uh elinor elinor hold it. Hold it elinor shut your trap what you're playing at

1472
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,120
I'm literally in the middle of a fake and you're not like telepathic. What's going on?

1473
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,800
Oh

1474
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,520
Well, actually now's not the time darlin now is not the time

1475
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,200
You don't care for the child you're just pretending

1476
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,720
You don't even fear

1477
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,120
They're such liars. They just want the atom

1478
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,040
So

1479
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,200
Are you done?

1480
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,760
Yes, there are a lot of monsters around

1481
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,320
Okay, sorry, um

1482
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,120
If you came to miss

1483
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:19,480
All right, sport time to feed the fish head on back to alexander's tank and put those plants in

1484
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,960
She was not meant to have a father delta

1485
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,880
She was to be an heir to my life's work

1486
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:33,640
And this is where they changed her

1487
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,440
Bonding her to you

1488
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:41,240
The child she was died in this room. No

1489
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,440
She loves me. She's mine

1490
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,720
Right, uh

1491
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:51,720
I'm gonna need to know upset you both. I won't pass you

1492
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,160
Okay, we're gonna save

1493
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,880
Just

1494
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:14,600
I gotta be for that right I need to stop using gallons and not giving me anything right we have saved

1495
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:20,680
We're gonna pop you away nice and safe and I'm gonna grab your sister that's right behind me right now

1496
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:25,640
Okay, I'm gonna get a little bit trouble. Yeah, we get trouble for it. There's fine. I'll deal with it

1497
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:31,000
And we'll play this diary. Oh, well, we did it

1498
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:39,960
We did it so if the game crashes we know it's because it can't handle a big daddy and a wee sister

1499
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,520
Can you attack the mpd, please?

1500
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:47,480
I

1501
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,760
Don't want to accidentally hurt him

1502
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:05,800
Oh, no, what the game can't handle a big sister coming in

1503
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:07,800
Oh

1504
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:14,920
This is a problem it seems to be a big sister is causing the game to crash

1505
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:21,400
Oh, is it just odds that she spawns in

1506
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,680
Is it just odds that she spawns in when I put a little sister away?

1507
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,640
I

1508
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:33,560
Lower the graphics. Okay. I'll lower the graphics and I'll put her in

1509
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:38,040
Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. Oh dear. We're trying we're trying we really are

1510
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,560
Right, I'll lower the graphics. I'll pop little sister away

1511
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,960

1512
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,960

Okay, just be quickly scavenger stuff that's fine and then I'll save as a pop her way

Yep, that's fine. That's fine

1515
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,560
She was not meant to have a father

1516
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,720
Okay, bad bad bad bad bad bad bad

1517
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,120
She was to be an heir to my life's work

1518
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:12,840
An heir to my life's work

1519
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,680
Bonding her to you

1520
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:21,880

1537
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,680
We have saved

1538
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,760
I'm going to

1539
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,800
Change the graphics to tiny whiny

1540
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:46,840
No, that's the same mode graphic options. Yeah, I was on the right one

1541
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:52,840
Oh, sorry graphics quality. Let's do nice and low apply

1542
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,320
Okay

1543
01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:01,480
Okay, now that we look like a pancake we are going to save again

1544
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:03,640
Okay

1545
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,640
Congrats if you didn't save it

1546
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,440
And then we're gonna pop you away darlin

1547
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,880
And there's going to be no big sister spawn. Okay, and if there is that's okay

1548
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,480
Okay

1549
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:33,640
Okay, that's okay that she's sponding because my game will not crash

1550
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:43,000
My game will not crash it's not gonna crash

1551
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:49,800
And my game is not gonna crash

1552
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:53,480
It's not gonna crash

1553
01:44:54,600 --> 01:45:01,800
I'm going to see a red big sister. Let's go. Oh wait, hold on. Hold on. Need to get need to get an action shot

1554
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,720
Oh, I miss who is she fighting because it's clearly not me

1555
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:14,680
Are you both fighting

1556
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,320
Oh, I'm having a

1557
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:23,000
Your little sister restores your health after gathering

1558
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,600
Oh, shit. I just fucking activated the wrong one. Are you serious?

1559
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:32,680
Okay, everyone's dying right now

1560
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:42,120
I do not have time to fight NPCs famed me as well. What's going on? Why are you spawning?

1561
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:54,120
Why are you fucking shooting things at me? Are you see is this game serious right now? Why are you fighting me?

1562
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,320
Stop, but what are you doing? Fight the sister

1563
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:07,560
That's absolutely annihilate in your arsehole right now. Not me. My god

1564
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:12,680
I I'm getting a blittery

1565
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:26,040
I did not realize how hard big sisters were. Holy shit. Use the flamethrower. Oh wait, this is my link

1566
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:43,560
Did she just run away from me

1567
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:49,560
Hello

1568
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:03,480
You may as well hop on my back now. Jeez. That's all that effort to get you

1569
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,680
Why is it keep

1570
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,400
You

1571
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Am I

1572
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,280
Where is she? Hello, is she here?

1573
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I think she's still here the music's still

1574
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:33,640
She's still prompted to be here

1575
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:36,600
I

1576
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,280
Is she down here

1577
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,440
Because I think she jumped down here

1578
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:51,160
Is she stuck in here?

1579
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:56,280
I think she may be stuck in the drop. Yeah, I think she's down stairs and she's stuck in the straw

1580
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,160
Hi bubbles

1581
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:13,080
Um, I think she's locked herself down here. I'm about to have a really annoying fight with her

1582
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,160
I literally can't even get out behind you you trolling

1583
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:29,480
Is she stuck down here she's not what did she get

1584
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:35,640
Oh

1585
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:51,560
This is bizarre, I don't know where she went. I mean she maybe it's useful it's plausible

1586
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:59,720
I mean the big sister music is still playing that's what my

1587
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:01,720
Uh

1588
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:14,360
How strange bioshock feel an extra wonky doodles

1589
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:24,040
Right so that's where I came out that's fine

1590
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,560
Is there anything I can look from here

1591
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:39,320
Sorry about the music being really intense when there's not much happening

1592
01:49:40,040 --> 01:49:42,040
I don't really know what I think she's

1593
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:47,720
Be spawned against something. I don't know what she must I think she's in a wall right now to be honest because

1594
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,600
Oh

1595
01:49:58,840 --> 01:50:00,840
It's just

1596
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,280
The game is having a time right now

1597
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:20,120
It was his will to die

1598
01:50:20,840 --> 01:50:24,760
To serve the majority by protecting them from his lunacy

1599
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:31,080
Your entire journey is based on your refusal to do this

1600
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:34,920
I'm just gonna put the other sister away right now because she's literally

1601
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:41,640
There's another one that I have to deal with right there. Like I don't know what the game wants from me. I'm so confused right now

1602
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:45,160
Sure, you live forever, but minus your body

1603
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:50,280
I like my body can't save right now feature the idea of my memories and

1604
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:55,400
Personality being stored in the head of some saintly child. Like just one more

1605
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:58,280
I don't know what's going on either random infighting

1606
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:08,200
Like the music is still going like she's here

1607
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:13,320
I'm just gonna save and I'm gonna put this sister away that's on my back right now because

1608
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:17,080
Yeah, there's another one waiting on me. I know I'm not

1609
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:19,880
I know I'm not doing the max amount of adam

1610
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:25,320
But literally if the game the game has just spawned another sister right behind me

1611
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:29,240
Like

1612
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:32,040
She's literally on her own green like I don't know what to do

1613
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,200
It's okay

1614
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,520
Yeah, let's just

1615
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,080
You do have to have oh you have to hack it for

1616
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:48,600
Like that music is big sister, but she's not here so

1617
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:54,600
All right, please no more music and it starts back up again

1618
01:51:56,360 --> 01:52:00,440
Okay, I'm just sorry. There's just too many little sisters right off you pop and you go

1619
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:02,440
Oh

1620
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:12,440
You're welcome

1621
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Okay

1622
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,880
And before like the sisters like over there or something

1623
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:29,240
I'll just be glad to get out of this area because I think this music is gonna permit through the whole thing

1624
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:31,800
Unless she's stuck like in this

1625
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,760
Wait

1626
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:41,640
Oh

1627
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,880
I know how to get into that room now

1628
01:52:45,720 --> 01:52:48,040
Ready gene bank. Jeez the graphics

1629
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:55,000
I will put the graphics back once we move on to the next area just because I don't wanna

1630
01:52:55,960 --> 01:53:01,000
Please music, please I'm begging. Give it a rest

1631
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:09,480
I need money. Oh, I've maxed money. Oh, sorry, didn't mean to

1632
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:21,480
Oh

1633
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
According to I confess

1634
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:38,760
Mother has destroyed dr. Alexander

1635
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:45,240
She tried to slice him into some kind of living saint who would calculate the common good

1636
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:47,640
A bit but

1637
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,960
Every time you turn your camera, she's just lurking there

1638
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:55,960
And

1639
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,280
Wow

1640
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:14,680
Okay

1641
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:22,840
Oh, we can do a pack of punch, sorry, I'm a courtier forgive me

1642
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:31,320
We put our elder sister through a new regimen of physical and mental conditioning and suited her up with

1643
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:34,920
Drill flip sides recoil

1644
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:41,000
I just want to do damage launch your damage. Yeah fucking damage all the way. Sorry

1645
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:48,360
After that the surface may be our only source

1646
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,880
The surface

1647
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:02,200
Yeah, she must have despawned and the game wants to register her

1648
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,920
I

1649
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:18,120
Would be scary if it wasn't for the fact the music is bugging out right. Hold on. Let me see because I don't think I've got this far

1650
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:20,200
I think my game broke before that

1651
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,360
I cannot recall

1652
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,560
I don't know what happens after

1653
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:34,200
I

1654
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:41,960
Oh big thing

1655
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:45,640
You have a favorite

1656
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,640
Oh

1657
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:05,160
Okay, we're all about reaching you make sure you do that's fine. Oh it bursts

1658
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:13,800
I've got wits on my side. She says that she's literally on fire

1659
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:23,240
I'm just gonna go written to make shooting if that's okay with you guys

1660
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:27,000
Oh, I did not mean to feel a waste of that but

1661
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:31,720
To complete that game motherfucker

1662
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:42,840
I guess I'm just to shoot them out until all your employees have been

1663
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,520
Spent if you will for lack of better words

1664
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:52,460
That girl is on fire

1665
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:06,040
Are you done?

1666
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:09,800
How dare you try to buy me out

1667
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:13,720
Sorry, I know you're monologuing but I need to realize

1668
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I feel like such a cheeky shit when I do that

1669
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:29,080
Goddamn you refilling just take me take me

1670
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:34,600
You reel him in now use that console there to take a gene sample

1671
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:38,040
It should print up a genetic key automatically

1672
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:41,320
Gene sample. Oh, yes. I know what button to hit

1673
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:55,960
It tickles

1674
01:57:57,880 --> 01:57:59,880
It tickles

1675
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:01,960
I

1676
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:12,360
Got a genetic you got the key to lambs had uh-huh Eleanor's down there now just head out to the oxyfill station and use it

1677
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,240
All right

1678
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,800
Okay, and then we're gonna save

1679
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,800
And we're gonna leave

1680
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:27,400
The sample disposal button on the panel in front of you would administer a massive jolt of electricity to the tank

1681
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:30,120
More than a kill me

1682
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:33,800
Whatever I may say to dissuade you do not listen

1683
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:37,400
The man whose voice you hear now is long gone

1684
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:43,800
As my mind fades I find my thoughts turn to the suffering that Eleanor will be made to endure

1685
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:46,280
And I don't kill this love

1686
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:49,080
But I can only offer my feeble prayers

1687
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,360
Perhaps after my death you can do more

1688
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:56,520
Now please I ask you to grant me peace

1689
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,880
You don't want to grant him peace

1690
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:05,480
Isn't that bad leave my boy alone. You don't want to grant him peace is like a big old

1691
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:10,440
Little thing. Did I even have any atom? Oh, I do have 400 atom. Uh, what are you?

1692
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:15,240
Oh, I'm like fully

1693
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:21,960
Kitted out for health and stuff what we doing scenery set the world on fire with this new eruption ability

1694
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:28,600
I've never not killed him. I did grant him peace please. I'm okay. I'll leave everyone. I'm not killing anyone

1695
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:32,600
I say that as if I don't mow down like literally all the splicers. Um

1696
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,800
Who didn't celerate?

1697
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,880
I want to do this anyway

1698
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,440
Oh about an achievement. I don't know what it was because it doesn't pop up

1699
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,120
Booth hand

1700
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:47,720
Careful tracker the hacking needle moves slightly so I shrub it

1701
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:51,880
Quiet footsteps on care you take no damage from electricity

1702

02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:11,720
Secret tunnel I'm doing the bioshock 2 remakes through the mountain

1755
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:23,880

1758
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,720
Swarm out of the mouth type onage. Absolutely

1759
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:42,040
Oh my god

1760
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:46,600
I'd be too scared to live in rapture. I'm too much of a baby. I don't want to be under water

1761
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:50,040
Well, wait a minute. You're a cuttlefish. Yeah, but I still breathe oxygen

1762
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:57,880
Listen up briefly and you belong to me and only wait, why are you spelling it like that feels good

1763
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:02,920
Listen up briefly and you belong to me and only me. No one else you can what I'm saying

1764
02:05:04,120 --> 02:05:08,200
That's right. You'd be a good boy. You take it like a good boy. That's right champ

1765
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:14,040
The game is stocking up

1766
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:19,560
Are you doing the dlc today? Oh, no, I don't think I have the dlc

1767
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:23,080
I just don't we'll be camping

1768
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:26,440
This is

1769
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:34,200
I'm trapped in a cage something's wrong. I end up putting you in a cage. What's going on?

1770
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:37,160
Get a little freaky

1771
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:41,320
Scaven

1772
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:46,200
No, I don't know what's up ahead. So I'm getting scared again. I wonder delta

1773
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:48,840
hydration check

1774
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:52,520
Have you any idea what my daughter has given you?

1775
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:57,480
I envy your ignorance

1776
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,960
You still believe

1777
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,360
The dlc comes with a collection. Oh, maybe I already have it

1778
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:06,920
Sorry, I don't know what's ahead. So now I'm scared again

1779
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:14,600
Oh, there's a pack of punch

1780
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:16,760
Surely it's safe if there's a pack of punch, right?

1781
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:23,640
What we're gonna do? I think I put damage on everything. So maybe shotgun clip size

1782
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:28,360
A double revolver mechanic allows six shots between this machine

1783
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Machine gun recoil or maybe you're right. I did that for that

1784
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:39,960
Okay, let's get rid of the recoil because that is a bit atrocious after that

1785
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:44,360
Daddy's

1786
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:47,960
Yeah, but I'm scared as well. So

1787
02:06:48,920 --> 02:06:50,920
I

1788
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:58,200
Terrified I don't want to go now because I'm not cocky anymore. There's a bumblebee ahead. I saw the bumblebee

1789
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:09,160
I'm gonna hack bumblebee. So he's mine. Oh my god. I'm actually fucking terrified bumblebee, please be mine

1790
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:19,080
Okay, hi mario. Hi buddy. Do you need healed or anything? No, you're good to go. Hi mario

1791
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:27,080
Oh my god, I'm actually so scared right no, it's fine. I've got the reef one. That's the main thing

1792
02:07:27,960 --> 02:07:29,960
Bumblebee is with me as well that helps

1793
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:33,240
I just remember that

1794
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,120
Three tons of steel of paternal raves. Okay. I want to see what life was like before rap

1795
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:40,200
I feel like rapture would have been so pretty

1796
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:45,720
Bro, it's too quiet. It's too quiet

1797
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:55,960

02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:04,120
One with her no, no, no, no stop

1799
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:07,880
This is so creepy

1800
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:19,560
That's her son elinor lamb no matter what you might be feeling right now. This is business. Huh that cage open. She's coming with us

1801
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:23,960

1802
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:27,480
Oh, she's not well

1803
02:08:28,520 --> 02:08:33,400
What the fuck forever in her what the fuck are you doing to her? How did I get out?

1804
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,120

02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,360
Sorry, I'm a bit of a violent beast

1807
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:45,080
I'm starting to whack in the glass

1808
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,320
Eh

1809
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:54,920
What they they're gonna mutate her into a big sister or something

1810
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:09,000
And take heart for you at least bumblebee and ninja step up right now

1811
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000

02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:33,240
Yep, yep

02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:38,040
Yeah, no, this is fine. This is fine. I don't know how the game didn't break either but

1814
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:47,320
Uh-huh, this is fine. This is fine. This is fine. No, seriously fine

1815
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:57,080
Uh-huh, uh-huh. This is fine. I can handle it. I can handle it

1816
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:02,200
Ow, okay. No, it's fine. Please don't back me into a corner

1817
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:07,080
Okay, that's good. That's my task. Thank you. Yep. Please don't back me into a corner

1818
02:10:08,040 --> 02:10:10,040
I do not consent

1819
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:23,640
Okay, now quarantine chambers waiting on you get in there. I'm fucking running I guess she's hi darlin

1820
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:36,440
Uh

1821
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:38,440
Look at her delta

1822
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,600
Am I still under hypnosis?

1823
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:45,880
Is she still in my head? Do you know why elena brought you here?

1824
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
She wanted a father

1825
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:53,900
So she found a way to restore you your body and mind

1826
02:11:07,240 --> 02:11:09,240
That rebuilt me

1827
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:16,600
And she has been watching you ever since exalting your every act of gospel

1828
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:22,440
Ah if you killed them

1829
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,200
The girl lying on that bed

1830
02:11:33,080 --> 02:11:35,080
Is no longer my child

1831
02:11:35,560 --> 02:11:42,520
Nor my work she is a monster she's my daughter alone

1832
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:48,680
Just as she has always wanted so we went bitch. Let us go

1833
02:11:49,720 --> 02:11:54,680
But there is one detail of your mutual bond. She failed your account for what?

1834
02:11:55,560 --> 02:12:00,760
Your body was designed to lapse into a coma when her heart ceases to beat

1835
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:03,480
Elena

1836
02:12:12,520 --> 02:12:15,240
Uh, I can't do anything

1837
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,400
You

1838
02:12:26,920 --> 02:12:30,680
Can you give her like a little punch in the chest just to kick start the heart that'd be great

1839
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:50,200
Until the expire I'm not dead yet just in a coma

1840
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:56,840
Father it's me

1841
02:12:56,840 --> 02:12:58,120
Eleanor

1842
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:02,520
I'm so sorry mother stopped my heart long enough to sever our bond

1843
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,480
Staying near me won't stop you from dying now

1844
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:10,040
Or worse, but I can still help you escape

1845
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:14,840
What this little sister's brought you something that will allow you to take control of her

1846
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,200
Eh

1847
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:22,200
Ah, jeez

1848
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:26,360
We fucking missed it. I find that work, but whatever that kind of hurt. I'm gonna lie

1849
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:29,400
God, that's why I look like check the drip

1850
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:37,560
Oh my god, wait what you have taken control of our wee sister. You can now use vents and gather atom

1851
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:45,800
I know this feels a bit strange father, but now you can see through her eyes and tell her where to go

1852
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:49,320
This is how I brought you back without mother catching on

1853
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:54,360
Now first, let's get you out of here. Oh my god. Everything

1854
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:58,520
Everything's beautiful because of my roost tinted glasses

1855
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:04,120
What this is amazing

1856
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,640
I hate this is so cool

1857
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:13,880
I'll save when I get out of the vent

1858
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:19,960
Oh my god, that's how they see

1859
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:28,360
There's a way to unlock these chambers she's holding us in find a way to slip in there

1860
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:31,720
Tell me save because it will break

1861
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:34,120
No

1862
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:42,120
I can't save oh well for breaks are breaks. Jeez. Okay. I won't let me save

1863
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:47,800
Oh my god, this is how they see the raptor. They see it beautiful and

1864
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:51,800
They have a shrine to daddy

1865
02:14:54,520 --> 02:14:56,520

02:15:02,840 --> 02:15:07,480
Gazillion screenshots, actually me. Why is there so many screenshots of my shop sitting in this folder?

1868
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:15,800
Office of the fear one

1869
02:15:18,520 --> 02:15:20,520
Bloodest pales

1870
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:31,240
Attention Augustus Sinclair has been cited within the facility

1871
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:33,960
He will attempt to reach

1872
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:40,760
I would do this part myself

1873
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:44,680
To save your life. I'm going to have to change

1874
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:47,480
To be like you

1875
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:54,760
From here you should be able to locate the pieces of a big sister suit. Please bring them to me

1876
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Daddy is so strong

1877
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:05,080
Not gonna I think AC would like this game if it

1878
02:16:07,160 --> 02:16:10,440
This is how we see oh my goodness

1879
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:23,400
Why aren't you that fast when I've got you

1880
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:28,200
worse

1881
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:30,200
I suspect Elena of

1882
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:33,240
direct involvement in his return

1883
02:16:34,680 --> 02:16:36,840
I fear that to separate them

1884
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:41,240
I'm ready and green to take measures for which I will be

1885
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:51,560
There's a piece of the suit in here father find the rest and bring them back to me. Oh, she's becoming a big sister

1886
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:53,560
Oh

1887
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:56,920
But is she gonna attack

1888
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:59,960
Ten years father

1889
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,680
Stuck in this this fever dream

1890
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:07,720
Mother kept me sedated in order to perfect my mind with adam

1891
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:11,640
To her the ideal child is a genius

1892
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:15,000
Serving the common good without questioning it

1893
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:18,120
You have saved me from that

1894
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:21,080
What was that

1895
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:24,440
Mr. Helmut almost

1896
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:41,480
Look everywhere AC or any AC because it's not doing well

1897
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:50,840
I

1898
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:09,640
So I don't get attacked by the ones that are nearby for some reason

1899
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:15,080
Why don't they attack me on my own? I don't understand

1900
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:20,760
The pictures and the statues changed based on your clothes

1901
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,800
If you don't attack me, I don't know why they're not attacking me

1902
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:34,520
Or do they only get ravenous when I'm talking about always safe with daddy

1903
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,880
Always stay close to a friend

1904
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:43,480
Hey, do you

1905
02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:47,320
Do

1906
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:56,360
Big sister went oh my god, I don't know how I'm gonna fight my own freaking daughter

1907
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:03,720
If you were evil this would look much different

1908
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:09,480
Mother was right about one thing

1909
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,200
I have been watching you father

1910
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:14,760
Studying the way you have treated others

1911
02:19:15,720 --> 02:19:17,880
And now I know who I am

1912
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:23,880
Choice is not cause oh, sorry

1913
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:26,120
Say

1914
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:30,280
Remember that same where I can't read and write but it's like literally my entire job to read and write

1915
02:19:30,840 --> 02:19:32,840
I am free

1916
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
After everything mother has done to me

1917
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:39,080
I am alive and sane enough to be curious about the sun

1918
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:42,120
When you rescued my new sisters

1919
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:44,520
I felt everyone

1920
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:48,200
And it gave me hope for the first time in years

1921
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:00,920
Here you go princess

1922
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:06,200
Okay, she's green

1923
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:09,640
Now I will do the same for all the others

1924
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:14,200
Starting with this one. We're saving the little sisters

1925
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:17,400
And freeing them

1926
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:27,000
Sorry, we have done it father. I'll be there soon

1927
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
She's gonna see

1928
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:40,840
Not her being mlg pro and she's been in the suit for like five seconds and it took me seven hours to understand the mechanics of the

1929
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:44,600
Fucking game these suits always did make me think of you father

1930
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:50,840
I guess I still remember you in shining armor, but now it's my turn to fight for you

1931
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:56,040
I don't know how much of a fighter I'm gonna be honey bun

Okay, I'm gonna save take this plasmid you can use it to call me to your side in a fight

1941
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:53,800
Can I reflash? I feel like we're getting right to the end of the game

1942
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:58,040
Let's try out

1943
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:05,880
I don't want to completely rely on her

1944
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:26,200
Sorry, sorry, I I can't aim I assume I can't actually hurt moan door

1945

1946
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:37,240
You have stolen my life's work

1947

And with it my only daughter

1948
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:45,080
But rapture is the house of monsters

1949
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:47,960
The surface will not have us

1950
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:52,920
In our real door have been pranked. We shall be buried as a family

1951

Side by side. I didn't shag you my mom

02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:04,440
I'm sorry. You mean the mother much. I was just going to drop this building into the trench. It's miles deep

1954
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,920
We have to find Sinclair

1955
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:10,200
Oh, it was that way

1956
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:23,800
Fucking hell elinor Jesus you're starting to scare me darlin. Yeah, yeah

Yeah, I think I'm longer. I look closer

1959
02:23:31,720 --> 02:23:33,720

Fucking slow down. You'll be ninja honestly. Why are you on that far? You even went wrong

1966
02:24:02,440 --> 02:24:07,720
This is Sinclair's life boat father out the window here. It's our only chance of escape

1967
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:12,200
From what I know of Sinclair. He wouldn't just abandon it

1968
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:17,000
Yes, delta

1969
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
What of Sinclair

1970
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:28,360
Uh, not the Naruto run. She's out for blood. She has a lot of pent-up anger. She needs a healthy way to vent. She's just venting darlin

1971
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:34,440
Uh, right

1972
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:45,320
This facility hangs over an ocean trench delta. The family has activated timed charges within its foundations

1973
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:51,320
I'm not tamed before detonation. I'm not really tamed. We shall fall and be crushed in the abyss below

1974
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:53,480
Am I really tamed to be honest?

1975
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:59,400
No, okay good. Now that has looked all of Persephone down including the gangway leading to the life boat

1976
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:03,560
I take too long to do. I'm a dilly-dally if I need to. Okay

1977
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:09,080
Uh, right, come on. Wait, what's come on? Let's write

1978
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:11,640
Sure, hint

1979
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:13,640
No hint. Okay. I'll go come on. Oh, there you go

1980
02:25:13,640 --> 02:25:18,040
The classmate if you need me father. I'm going to have a look around

1981
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:21,800
I'd rather just have you in

1982
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:35,400
I got an A plus for that. I didn't even do anything. Okay, sorry. Let me let me fucking be calibrated

1983
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:40,840
I'm legit just keeping her out. If she's freaking killin' for me, why would I not keep her out?

1984
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:45,960
You can do health upgrades

1985
02:25:53,160 --> 02:25:58,200
I'll send you a postcard from the beach. Ow, what the fuck are you?

1986
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:04,760
Wait, are these guys Philly? Oh, these guys aren't even Philly. Think I'm a Bulbert

1987
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:07,400
I

1988
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:14,520
Sorry, I didn't realize I didn't get those guys really done up

1989
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:19,320
Okay, sorry

1990
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:23,720
Because if she's with you, she's not finding something clear

1991
02:26:26,440 --> 02:26:31,880
How did I do that? Oh, excuse me, pardon me. Uh, you? You?

1992
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:39,480
I just buy it out. Just buy it out. Fuck it. I just buy it out. I've got enough money

1993
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:43,800
You can hack that for a vehicle

1994
02:26:52,120 --> 02:26:54,280
Am I gonna pop my clothes if I didn't get it in time?

1995
02:26:55,880 --> 02:27:00,840
That would have kind of something. I'm gonna lie. I'm kind of stuck if I, you know, spend all that time to get here

1996
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:03,400
and the game's like I perish

1997
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:08,520
But I hear something tingling in. I hear tingling in Eleanor. You need to help me. I'm a bit of a brain

1998
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:13,720
Oh, I was on the I was on the wall. Sorry Eleanor. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry. This suit is a bit bigger than I thought

Mommy's the princess she needs to be carried honestly

2001
02:27:28,040 --> 02:27:33,000
One final alpha series ready to die for the family

2002
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:35,640
As Persephone's former owner

2003
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:40,520
He is the ideal man to put you back in your cage

2004

Oh my god, this isn't why did I drink so much?

2022
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:35,800
I've been hard man. That's how it is down there. I'm a hard man

I know you can hear me

2031
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:26,760
I am inside Sinclair's lifeboat now. Is this an enemy delta? I know she's right, but

2032
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:32,920
What's with the Emily? She's screaming right now. She wants to jump in but I'm almost finished. I think we're at the end of the year

2033
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:36,200
We shall return to the surface together

2034
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:43,560
If you know what is this in this game, it's like the daddy's will for your duty. Remember Eleanor

2035
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:46,440
Mummy loves you

2036
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:49,400
Oh, yes

2037
02:30:49,960 --> 02:30:52,920
Mother's testing me one last game

2038
02:30:53,880 --> 02:31:01,000
Fortunately by now, I'm the world's foremost expert at breaking her rule. Eleanor. Use flamethrower as you do

2039
02:31:01,960 --> 02:31:04,680
I'd kiss Sinclair on the lip die for it

2040
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:11,080
Does she not attack if she just had enough

2041
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:17,800
Let's just leave her be then. She's already having a tough enough time

2042
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:26,680
Yeah, I can't carry anyone done

2043
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:31,320
Oh that was Sinclair

2044
02:31:31,880 --> 02:31:33,880
Ah

2045
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:46,520
Did he just run at me with fire? Yeah, let's get Sinclair and beat his ass

2046
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:50,920
It seems like this is gonna be the fight

2047
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:55,160
Defeats Sinclair

2048
02:31:55,400 --> 02:31:59,000
Kid, I'm sorry. I I've locked you in here

2049
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:03,240
Lamb's making me dance on her goddamn strings. I can't

2050
02:32:04,120 --> 02:32:05,240
Stop

2051
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:08,440
You're gonna have to break in here and put me down

2052
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:14,600
Wish there was another way but I'd rather die a man than live like this

2053
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,720
You don't want to be a big daddy. What's wrong with being a daddy?

2054
02:32:18,440 --> 02:32:20,440
God, he's right father

2055
02:32:20,680 --> 02:32:24,520
Mother's betting you'll die in here or that I'll abandon you before the bombs detonate

2056
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:28,600
We can't save Sinclair now. We need that key from him

2057
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:32,920
Find the code to the watch tower or work out a way to draw him out

2058
02:32:35,800 --> 02:32:39,400
I tell you the code to that that keypad if I could

2059
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:43,480
It's like lambs put walls up in my head

2060
02:32:44,200 --> 02:32:46,840
But the prisoners here might have walked out the number

2061
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:49,160
Check the cells

2062
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:52,840
Please hurry it hurts to keep singing out without say so

2063
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:57,160
Oh, bro, I wasn't gonna attack you but you didn't know

2064
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:00,120
The cells check the cell

2065
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:07,800
Two wait five two five four maybe

2066
02:33:11,080 --> 02:33:13,080
Do you mind

2067
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:19,080
Increase the damage, thank you

2068
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:24,280
You cheater. No, we know what it is. That was the code that we had the other time

2069
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:29,720
We came across that code on the teleportation sequence

2070
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:35,320
No

2071
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:41,880
Son, I built this place and I I did rent you out to those plasma trials up at Fontaine

2072
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:43,720
and now

2073
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:45,720
No, I'm paying for it

2074
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:48,120
Wish I had time to make amends

2075
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,240
Take the black boat. It's all yours. Just don't leave me like this

2076
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:55,800
That kill him

2077
02:33:59,480 --> 02:34:01,480
That kill him

2078
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:04,600
Can you just stop shooting each other so I can hack you

2079
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:11,720
Wait, I'm confused so let me in or not

2080
02:34:14,360 --> 02:34:16,360
I said that for most

2081
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:19,320
I

2082
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:27,720
Think I'll need to heal you though. I can't heal you told me

2083
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:31,240
Let me in

2084
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:34,360
The code is wrong. Oh, it's not the right code. My apologies. Okay

2085
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Uh, right. Let let us come in small. Um

2086
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:42,200
We'll do some exploring

2087
02:34:42,360 --> 02:34:44,360
Is this a dead end in here

2088
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:47,160
Can I have a light switch, please? Thank you

2089
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,160
This is about to me again. That's utterly terrifying. Is this a butterfly?

2090
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:59,640
Eh, mago is a porno, so that doesn't need to tell me nothing, does it?

2091
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:05,640
You got the code

2092
02:35:06,520 --> 02:35:09,640
No, no, two six seven three quick

2093
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:13,800
Don't be something with the elemental sponge you get bonus

2094
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:16,920
local

2095
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:24,120
Two six seven three two six seven three two six seven three two

2096
02:35:24,600 --> 02:35:30,040
And a six and a seven and a three and a two and six and a seven

2097
02:35:30,040 --> 02:36:00,040
And a seven, and a two, and a two, and a six, and a seven, and a eight, and a two, and a six, and a seven, and a seven, and a six, and a seven, and a seven, and a three, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven, and a seven

2098
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:19,580
and a

2099
02:36:19,580 --> 02:36:24,360
seven,

2100
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:26,400
a $19.

2101
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:29,380
The

2102
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:34,420
to her daughter, guess she figures they're irredeemable.

2103
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:38,420
Now I got guys clamoring for the next item.

2104
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:42,580
And I want teeth to squeeze any of them, good doctor.

2105
02:36:42,580 --> 02:36:43,340
Guess I'm lucky.

2106
02:36:43,340 --> 02:36:45,460
You need your parents, don't you, too?

2107
02:36:45,460 --> 02:36:46,940
Phineas, there you are.

2108
02:36:46,940 --> 02:36:52,060
Why are you telling me on fire, but you won't let me do them.

2109
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:54,540
OK, activate.

2110
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:58,060
Right engaged, ending security curfew.

2111
02:36:58,100 --> 02:36:59,780
It's time.

2112
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:00,980
Where are we going?

2113
02:37:00,980 --> 02:37:01,940
Oh, we're stuck in here?

2114
02:37:01,940 --> 02:37:03,820
What?

2115
02:37:03,820 --> 02:37:05,220
There's a few alpha.

2116
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:09,900
Sinclair died a hero of the Rapture family, Delta.

2117
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:10,460
No, he didn't.

2118
02:37:10,460 --> 02:37:13,900
Was he a friend to you, or just a tool?

2119
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:15,220
I already repaired Tommy.

2120
02:37:15,220 --> 02:37:15,720
OK.

2121
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:18,380
Can you even grasp the difference?

2122
02:37:18,380 --> 02:37:22,900
And Eleanor, you have chosen Subject Delta

2123
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:27,700
over your mother, your people, and the duty of your birth.

2124
02:37:28,660 --> 02:37:32,940
She may not be your mama, but I sure as hell am your daddy.

2125
02:37:40,940 --> 02:37:42,420
I said that wrong, didn't I?

2126
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:43,980
Curfew lifted.

2127
02:37:43,980 --> 02:37:46,700
All cell blocks open.

2128
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:49,380
No, I just shot my own freaking drone.

2129
02:37:49,380 --> 02:37:51,820
Are you serious?

2130
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:52,900
Yes, I'm special needs.

2131
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:55,060
Mother's turned her attention to the lifeboat.

2132
02:37:55,060 --> 02:37:57,300
We must go there, now.

2133
02:37:57,300 --> 02:37:58,540
I'm working on it.

2134
02:37:58,540 --> 02:38:00,020
I'm working, baby.

2135
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:00,900
Yes, I get the shot.

2136
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:02,100
I get the shot, got it.

2137
02:38:06,100 --> 02:38:07,620
All right, here.

2138
02:38:07,620 --> 02:38:09,980
I'm going to pick up some stuff, thank you.

2139
02:38:09,980 --> 02:38:11,060
Oh, wrong way, wrong way.

2140
02:38:11,060 --> 02:38:12,500
Sorry, sorry.

2141
02:38:12,500 --> 02:38:13,660
I know where I'm going.

2142
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:14,980
I know where I'm going.

2143
02:38:14,980 --> 02:38:15,980
I know where I'm going.

2144
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:17,140
You killed Tommy.

2145
02:38:17,140 --> 02:38:18,940
No, I'm sorry, Tommy.

2146
02:38:18,940 --> 02:38:21,180
I didn't mean to.

2147
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:23,740
I just have terrible accuracy.

2148
02:38:23,740 --> 02:38:25,900
It was, ow.

2149
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:27,620
It's nothing personal.

2150
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:35,980
We're making our way to the ship.

2151
02:38:35,980 --> 02:38:38,100
We're making our way to the ship.

2152
02:38:38,100 --> 02:38:40,220
We're going to the ship, and we're making our way,

2153
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:41,820
and we're making our way to the ship.

2154
02:38:45,820 --> 02:38:47,940
Oh, no.

2155
02:38:47,940 --> 02:38:51,020
Eleanor's going to have freedom.

2156
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:54,020
Oh.

2157
02:38:54,020 --> 02:38:57,980
You've got a little fart on your fringe, Mr. Lamb.

2158
02:39:04,820 --> 02:39:06,140
They're all in my way.

2159
02:39:19,140 --> 02:39:21,140
OK, that'll do, that'll do, that'll do.

2160
02:39:24,540 --> 02:39:26,540
I can help.

2161
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:28,020
I like, is this a purple to help?

2162
02:39:28,020 --> 02:39:31,500
OK, they're spawning for me to face.

2163
02:39:31,500 --> 02:39:35,420
OK, let's save before things go terrible.

2164
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:38,620
I should have created a fart on me instead.

2165
02:39:38,620 --> 02:39:40,020
You need repair yet, Tommy?

2166
02:39:40,020 --> 02:39:41,180
Oh, no, Tommy lived.

2167
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:44,900
I killed, is it fair or Finney?

2168
02:39:44,900 --> 02:39:47,820
Finney is a burp, burp, and Finney.

2169
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:49,620
Finney is a burp, burp, and burp.

2170
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:52,380
Lamb knows the way, do you know the way?

2171
02:39:54,660 --> 02:39:55,980
Are we going to make it?

2172
02:39:55,980 --> 02:40:01,260
I need a few more shotguns, but can it

2173
02:40:01,260 --> 02:40:02,740
give me them the thing?

2174
02:40:02,740 --> 02:40:04,780
I respect that.

2175
02:40:04,780 --> 02:40:05,700
Something's in my way.

2176
02:40:05,700 --> 02:40:06,700
Ooh, something's bugging out.

2177
02:40:06,700 --> 02:40:08,580
Ooh, it's all bugging out.

2178
02:40:08,580 --> 02:40:09,380
Uh.

2179
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,820
I was afraid of this.

2180
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:13,740
Mother has bombed out the ballast compressors, father.

2181
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:16,620
The lifeboat will be too heavy to launch.

2182
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:21,660
Unless, let me think, balance transfer is false.

2183
02:40:21,820 --> 02:40:24,340
Balance transfer is false.

2184
02:40:24,340 --> 02:40:26,940
Transfer, I'm afraid that I can boil the water

2185
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:28,700
and get the lifeboat to rise.

2186
02:40:28,700 --> 02:40:31,780
But I can't generate that much heat alone.

2187
02:40:31,780 --> 02:40:34,580
It's time to recruit the rest of mother's little sisters

2188
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:39,100
or taking them with us and head to the pediatric wards.

2189
02:40:39,100 --> 02:40:40,100
The pediatric?

2190
02:40:40,100 --> 02:40:41,500
Oh, infirmary, right.

2191
02:40:41,500 --> 02:40:42,900
This is exactly where we need to go.

2192
02:40:42,900 --> 02:40:44,020
Nope, no, it's not.

2193
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:44,860
What?

2194
02:40:44,860 --> 02:40:47,020
It's therapy.

2195
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:48,700
You have a multi-part goal.

2196
02:40:48,700 --> 02:40:50,620
Press back to go to the Goal tab

2197
02:40:50,620 --> 02:40:53,140
and see what part of the goal and switch which one is active.

2198
02:40:53,140 --> 02:40:56,020
The arrow on the map will guide you to the active goal.

2199
02:40:56,020 --> 02:40:57,020
Oh.

2200
02:41:01,020 --> 02:41:02,180
You can't give me two in one.

2201
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:02,780
Just tell me.

2202
02:41:02,780 --> 02:41:04,460
Just video games.

2203
02:41:04,460 --> 02:41:06,140
Just tell me to go in one direction.

2204
02:41:06,140 --> 02:41:07,060
Please, that's all I ask.

2205
02:41:07,060 --> 02:41:08,660
Just give me one objective at a time.

2206
02:41:08,660 --> 02:41:10,020
Don't give me multiple.

2207
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:12,580
Right, therapy is apparently where the little wings are.

2208
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:16,380
Right, let's go grab.

2209
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:17,300
Follow the arrow.

2210
02:41:17,300 --> 02:41:18,060
I'm going to do it.

2211
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:20,780
I thought I was going to be the other one, but it's not.

2212
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:23,140
Oh, yeah, bleh, that hurts.

2213
02:41:23,140 --> 02:41:25,780
I won't let her take you from me again, father.

2214
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:26,660
Hold on.

2215
02:41:26,660 --> 02:41:28,740
I'm trying.

2216
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:31,700
Papa's trying.

2217
02:41:31,700 --> 02:41:34,940
OK, there's a med kit so I can soup.

2218
02:41:34,940 --> 02:41:36,060
Oh, no, that was just alcohol.

2219
02:41:36,060 --> 02:41:37,260
I don't know why I keep drinking.

2220
02:41:37,260 --> 02:41:39,700
Sorry, I seem to have quite a vase with it.

2221
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:42,260
I don't know if it's because of my guy right now.

2222
02:41:42,260 --> 02:41:42,760
Actually.

2223
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:45,760
Why is this a horror game?

2224
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:47,760
What the fuck was that?

2225
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:51,760
This is not a server.

2226
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:52,760
What was that?

2227
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:54,760
No insight.

2228
02:41:54,760 --> 02:41:58,760
Every word I speak, you already know.

2229
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:05,760
We will be reborn.

2230
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:06,760
Not quite.

2231
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:08,760
Can I hear you?

2232
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:09,760
Oh, shit.

2233
02:42:09,760 --> 02:42:10,760
I don't know.

2234
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:12,760
Oh, shit.

2235
02:42:12,760 --> 02:42:14,760
I didn't know she was coming with me for a game.

2236
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:18,760
Mother's people are starting to detonate the charges.

2237
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:19,760
We don't have long.

2238
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:20,760
Oh, shit.

2239
02:42:20,760 --> 02:42:21,760
Am I actually under a timer?

2240
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:23,760
I thought I wasn't.

2241
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:25,760
OK, she's beating them up.

2242
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:29,760
I'm sorry.

2243
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,760
OK, follow the arrow.

2244
02:42:30,760 --> 02:42:31,760
I'm following the arrow.

2245
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:32,760
Follow the arrow.

2246
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:35,760
Arrow, arrow, arrow.

2247
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:36,760
Stop.

2248
02:42:36,760 --> 02:42:37,760
No.

2249
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:44,760
I'm following the arrow.

2250
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:47,760
I'm missing all my shots, which is really embarrassing.

2251
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:49,760
Don't work.

2252
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:50,760
I'm following the arrow.

2253
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:51,760
Pediatric ward.

2254
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:52,760
We're almost to the pediatric ward.

2255
02:42:52,760 --> 02:42:53,760
Yes.

2256
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:55,760
I expect we'll be fighting our way inside.

2257
02:42:55,760 --> 02:42:56,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2258
02:42:56,760 --> 02:42:57,760
I'm going to be honest.

2259
02:42:57,760 --> 02:42:59,760
I expected that too, question mark.

2260
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:01,760
When have I not fought in any part, right?

2261
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:06,760
We'll leave the mentally unwell alone.

2262
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:11,760
I hear footsteps.

2263
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:13,760
But no, baby.

2264
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:15,760
OK, I've already marked them.

2265
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:16,760
OK.

2266
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:18,760
OK.

2267
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:20,760
OK.

2268
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:29,760
Actually, my second darling.

2269
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:31,760
Push the call button on a window.

2270
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:32,760
Yes, I will.

2271
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:34,760
I will push call button on the window.

2272
02:43:34,760 --> 02:43:35,760
Yes.

2273
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:37,760
Thank you.

2274
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:40,760
Call button on window.

2275
02:43:40,760 --> 02:43:42,760
Call button on window.

2276
02:43:42,760 --> 02:43:43,760
Call button.

2277
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:44,760
This.

2278
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:46,760
It isn't safe to begin yet.

2279
02:43:46,760 --> 02:43:49,760
We must finish off the splices first.

2280
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:50,760
OK.

2281
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:51,760
Splices first.

2282
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:52,760
Splices first.

2283
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:02,760
OK.

2284
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:03,760
OK.

2285
02:44:06,760 --> 02:44:07,760
OK.

2286
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:12,760
There's a lot of noise going on.

2287
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:14,760
Oh, wait.

2288
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:15,760
Hold on.

2289
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:17,760
I haven't got these guys still yet.

2290
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:22,760
Ah.

2291
02:44:28,760 --> 02:44:29,760
Leave.

2292
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:33,760
OK.

2293
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:34,760
OK.

2294
02:44:34,760 --> 02:44:36,760
Everyone, just calm down.

2295
02:44:36,760 --> 02:44:37,760
Everyone, take a moment.

2296
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:39,760
Take a chill pill.

2297
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:42,760
Take a second to collect your thoughts.

2298
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:46,760
Is everyone OK?

2299
02:44:46,760 --> 02:44:48,760
Everyone, calm down.

2300
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:50,760
No more Adam to spend.

2301
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:51,760
OK.

2302
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:54,760
Are we satisfied with our little boss fight?

2303
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:57,760
Out you come, pumpkin splices.

2304
02:44:57,760 --> 02:44:58,760
God, that's a lot.

2305
02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:00,760
I'll wake the children up.

2306
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:02,760
They're stronger than they know.

2307
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:04,760
I should be able to boil off the water

2308
02:45:04,760 --> 02:45:06,760
and get us all out of here.

2309
02:45:06,760 --> 02:45:07,760
OK.

2310
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:09,760
She's going to deal with them this time.

2311
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:10,760
Go ahead, father.

2312
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:12,760
I'll free them as quickly as I can,

2313
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:13,760
just as you showed me.

2314
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:14,760
OK.

2315
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:15,760
OK.

2316
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:16,760
Yes.

2317
02:45:16,760 --> 02:45:17,760
Yes.

2318
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:18,760
Yes.

2319
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:19,760
Yes.

2320
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:20,760
Yes.

2321
02:45:20,760 --> 02:45:21,760
Yes.

2322
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:22,760
Yes.

2323
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:23,760
Yes.

2324
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:24,760
Yes.

2325
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:25,760
Yes.

2326
02:45:25,760 --> 02:45:26,760
Yes.

2327
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:27,760
Yes.

2328
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:28,760
Yes.

2329
02:45:28,760 --> 02:45:29,760
Yes.

2330
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:30,760
Yes.

2331
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:31,760
Yes.

2332
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:33,760
Why not let them faint out?

2333
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:39,760
Why not let them faint out instead of just faint?

2334
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:47,760
Aw, OK.

2335
02:45:47,760 --> 02:45:49,760
That's so wholesome.

2336
02:45:54,760 --> 02:45:56,760
That's actually so wholesome.

2337
02:45:56,760 --> 02:45:57,760
What the heck?

2338
02:45:57,760 --> 02:45:58,760
I didn't expect that.

2339
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:02,760
That's so sweet.

2340
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:07,760
Oh, my God.

2341
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:09,760
I didn't expect that at all.

2342
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:11,760
Like, what the heck?

2343
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:14,760
This game got me feeling stuff.

2344
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:16,760
You're literally invisible.

2345
02:46:19,760 --> 02:46:20,760
Invisibly an attack.

2346
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:30,760
I'm trying, baby cake.

2347
02:46:30,760 --> 02:46:33,760
Don't let your dad kick a little bit, OK?

2348
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:37,760
I'm trying.

2349
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:38,760
I'm trying.

2350
02:46:38,760 --> 02:46:39,760
I'm trying.

2351
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:41,760
I maybe need to buy some almonds.

2352
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:49,760
Speaking of leading boats.

2353
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:56,760
Thank you.

2354
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:04,760
That was your gift to her, Delta.

2355
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:06,760
Just as she hoped.

2356
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:08,760
You must be very proud.

2357
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:13,760
Yes, this is pro pro pro pro pro pro pro pro.

2358
02:47:16,760 --> 02:47:17,760
It hurts.

2359
02:47:18,760 --> 02:47:21,760
Steady father, don't let go now.

2360
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:22,760
I'm not let go.

2361
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:23,760
I'm not let go.

2362
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:24,760
I'm OK.

2363
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:25,760
I'm OK.

2364
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:26,760
Hold it together.

2365
02:47:26,760 --> 02:47:27,760
Hold it together.

2366
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:28,760
I'm fine.

2367
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:29,760
Water level.

2368
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:36,760
Because you're a terrible doctor and you killed him.

2369
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:41,760
Oh, something's happened.

2370
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:43,760
Hold on.

2371
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:44,760
Let me see.

2372
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:49,760
Meanwhile, people are, I think lime will be a little bit crazy.

2373
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:52,760
Wow.

2374
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:54,760
Oh, I see you.

2375
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:01,760
I literally see that guy back there.

2376
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:04,760
I see him in the quarantine area.

2377
02:48:04,760 --> 02:48:06,760
Is it going to like burst out?

2378
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:09,760
Are you going to burst out?

2379
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:10,760
Be honest.

2380
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:12,760
Are you going to burst all over me?

2381
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:13,760
What?

2382
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:15,760
No, that's even creepier.

2383
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:17,760
No, I'm not even interacting with that.

2384
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:19,760
I'm not even interacting with that.

2385
02:48:19,760 --> 02:48:21,760
That's even creepier than I could have imagined.

2386
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:23,760
Did you see that?

2387
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,760
They purposely made them disappear.

2388
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:26,760
No, fuck off.

2389
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:27,760
You're scaring me.

2390
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:30,760
Did you see that?

2391
02:48:36,760 --> 02:48:40,760
I mean, it makes sense they would have over these in the back room.

2392
02:48:52,760 --> 02:48:55,760
Hey, you're not the only one with pyro in these parts.

2393
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:56,760
Fuck off.

2394
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:00,760
Is it going to be a little...

2395
02:49:00,760 --> 02:49:01,760
Am I going the right way?

2396
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:04,760
Sorry, I'm a bit topsy-turvy right now.

2397
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:10,760
She is daughter to all of us.

2398
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:13,760
No, she's main and you can't have her.

2399
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:24,760
I'm a bit pinned right now, but I think I'll be okay.

2400
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:29,760
Okay, let's use a revolt gun now.

2401
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:31,760
I'm naughty, naughty.

2402
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:34,760
I've not been scavenging as much as I should.

2403
02:49:34,760 --> 02:49:35,760
Because I'm running out of bullets.

2404
02:49:35,760 --> 02:49:37,760
Animal bullets.

2405
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:44,760
Sorry.

2406
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:45,760
Sorry, I know you're...

2407
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:51,760
Sorry, caught your monologue and just need to buy some bullets first there for the next few fights that are coming up the whole time.

2408
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:52,760
Pack a punch?

2409
02:49:52,760 --> 02:49:53,760
No.

2410
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:01,760
I saw that.

2411
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:02,760
What?

2412
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:05,760
Wait, what?

2413
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:09,760
I saw it!

2414
02:50:12,760 --> 02:50:14,760
I saw it!

2415
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:17,760
It's fricking doing that to me.

2416
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:21,760
When you've cleared them out, I'll need a signal like before.

2417
02:50:21,760 --> 02:50:24,760
Push the call button and I'll proceed.

2418
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:30,760
I'm sorry.

2419
02:50:36,760 --> 02:50:38,760
Okay, I find the call button.

2420
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:43,760
The game got me thinking I'm going crazy.

2421
02:50:48,760 --> 02:50:53,760
Oh, I love the shotgun.

2422
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:59,760
Did I not upgrade the chambers of the restrict?

2423
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:01,760
I'm not the pickpocket.

2424
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:03,760
Why are you even up there?

2425
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:05,760
I can't even reach you.

2426
02:51:06,760 --> 02:51:08,760
How riveting.

2427
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:10,760
You are crazy, but also in denial.

2428
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:13,760
I'm going to kill you.

2429
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:18,760
Don't do that.

2430
02:51:18,760 --> 02:51:20,760
That wasn't very nice.

2431
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:34,760
I'm going to need some of these bullets.

2432
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:36,760
Animal bullets.

2433
02:51:36,760 --> 02:51:39,760
To see bullets in French, you see in bad.

2434
02:51:40,760 --> 02:51:45,760
And to see one shot, one kill in French, you see in bad, in not.

2435
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:50,760
Oh, jeez, you're already here.

2436
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:52,760
God, give me a heart attack, darling.

2437
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:54,760
You're really good at doing that.

2438
02:51:54,760 --> 02:51:55,760
You know that, right?

2439
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:56,760
Ring, ring.

2440
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:09,760
Okay, okay, okay.

2441
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:10,760
I'm going in one.

2442
02:52:12,760 --> 02:52:14,760
Animal bullets.

2443
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:17,760
Maybe this will work.

2444
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,760
Okay, we have plenty on this one.

2445
02:52:20,760 --> 02:52:21,760
Is that what'll make her...

2446
02:52:21,760 --> 02:52:22,760
Yeah, it was.

2447
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:33,760
Spread.

2448
02:52:36,760 --> 02:52:38,760
You are damning them.

2449
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:46,760
Sorry, I think I might have taken the wrong turn.

2450
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:49,760
I don't...

2451
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:50,760
It's a docking platform.

2452
02:52:50,760 --> 02:52:52,760
I don't do anything.

2453
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:54,760
Beautiful music.

2454
02:52:54,760 --> 02:52:55,760
I like my bullets.

2455
02:53:00,760 --> 02:53:02,760
I'm following the arrow like a good girl.

2456
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:05,760
I'm good at following arrows.

2457
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:08,760
I'm following the arrow.

2458
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:13,760
Why is that?

2459
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:15,760
She's like going all around my head.

2460
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:18,760
Okay, okay.

2461
02:53:18,760 --> 02:53:19,760
Is there army?

2462
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:22,760
I don't know.

2463
02:53:22,760 --> 02:53:23,760
Are they really at heat like that?

2464
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:24,760
I'm not gonna lie.

2465
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:28,760
Okay, okay.

2466
02:53:28,760 --> 02:53:29,760
You're for it.

2467
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:30,760
Move back.

2468
02:53:36,760 --> 02:53:38,760
And feed her to a world without hope.

2469
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:39,760
Yeah.

2470
02:53:39,760 --> 02:53:41,760
Though Utopia may die with her.

2471
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:43,760
I would sooner see her...

2472
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:45,760
Some Utopia raptor is he, John.

2473
02:53:46,760 --> 02:53:48,760
Mother will be waiting for you.

2474
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:52,760
Here they come, father.

2475
02:53:52,760 --> 02:53:55,760
Hold them off until I can bring it to a boil.

2476
02:53:57,760 --> 02:53:59,760
Hey, John.

2477
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:07,760
I got him.

2478
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:09,760
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

2479
02:54:12,760 --> 02:54:13,760
Animal bullets.

2480
02:54:16,760 --> 02:54:17,760
Actually, why...

2481
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:19,760
I don't know why they all act in like this place.

2482
02:54:19,760 --> 02:54:20,760
It's like all lovely and stuff.

2483
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:22,760
Aren't people stabbing each other in needles

2484
02:54:22,760 --> 02:54:24,760
to try and get a little hint of Adam?

2485
02:54:24,760 --> 02:54:25,760
Like...

2486
02:54:25,760 --> 02:54:26,760
Nearly boiling.

2487
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:28,760
I'm working on it.

2488
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:31,760
I'll hold them off.

2489
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:32,760
You just keep doing your thing, darling.

2490
02:54:32,760 --> 02:54:33,760
You're doing great.

2491
02:54:33,760 --> 02:54:34,760
Keep it up.

2492
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:36,760
You are doing fantastic.

2493
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:39,760
And I'm not male distressed at all.

2494
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:44,760
Animal bullets.

2495
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:49,760
We're doing fine.

2496
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:50,760
It's okay.

2497
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:53,760
I heard a noise behind me, but I guess that's no harm.

2498
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:56,760
Oh.

2499
02:54:56,760 --> 02:54:58,760
You don't have to tell me too much.

2500
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:00,760
I can help you fight back now.

2501
02:55:00,760 --> 02:55:02,760
Use the plasma.

2502
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:03,760
Oh.

2503
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:05,760
You don't have to tell me twice to use the plasma.

2504
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:06,760
Do you, Joakim?

2505
02:55:06,760 --> 02:55:07,760
Hold on.

2506
02:55:10,760 --> 02:55:11,760
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

2507
02:55:12,760 --> 02:55:13,760
Okay.

2508
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:14,760
Is she in?

2509
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:15,760
She's in.

2510
02:55:15,760 --> 02:55:16,760
Right, okay.

2511
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:17,760
Swap to the fire.

2512
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:19,760
Oh, it's him.

2513
02:55:24,760 --> 02:55:25,760
Increase damage.

2514
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:27,760
That's what I want to see, baby.

2515
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:28,760
Okay.

2516
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:31,760
Is there more to these guys?

2517
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:32,760
Or is that everyone?

2518
02:55:32,760 --> 02:55:33,760
No, there's more.

2519
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:34,760
Jeez.

2520
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:37,760
I really did not investigate those guys much at all.

2521
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:42,760
Ow.

2522
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:44,760
Fucking hell.

2523
02:55:44,760 --> 02:55:46,760
How many others are you?

2524
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:47,760
Relax.

2525
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:49,760
Oh, shit.

2526
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:50,760
Who did that?

2527
02:55:51,760 --> 02:55:53,760
That was a terrible attempt at an attack.

2528
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:54,760
How was that?

2529
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:56,760
Sorry.

2530
02:55:56,760 --> 02:55:59,760
I'm just trying to, like, variety how I'm killing them all.

2531
02:55:59,760 --> 02:56:03,760
Because I've not exactly got them fucking much gray.

2532
02:56:03,760 --> 02:56:05,760
I'm getting, like, A pluses for them, but...

2533
02:56:08,760 --> 02:56:09,760
Who?

2534
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:12,760
Okay, I'll just let Elinor deal with the rest.

2535
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:17,760
So, there's so many of these guys.

2536
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:19,760
How are they not fully leveled up?

2537
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:20,760
What is blue?

2538
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:24,760
Uh, I mean...

2539
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:29,760
Okay.

2540
02:56:32,760 --> 02:56:35,760
Elinor, darling, I'm gonna need you to clutch up, like, right now,

2541
02:56:35,760 --> 02:56:36,760
because I suck at it.

2542
02:56:42,760 --> 02:56:43,760
Ugh.

2543
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:46,760
I mean, at least they're dropping now.

2544
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:50,760
Please stop spraying fire at me.

2545
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:56,760
Bro, I cannot take any more photos of these guys.

2546
02:56:56,760 --> 02:56:58,760
This is getting ridiculous.

2547
02:57:06,760 --> 02:57:07,760
Okay.

2548
02:57:09,760 --> 02:57:10,760
Yes.

2549
02:57:12,760 --> 02:57:15,760
Well, you aren't escaping anytime soon if you're stuck behind that.

2550
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:17,760
I mean, release the docking mechanism.

2551
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,760
I'm docking so hard right now.

2552
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:21,760
I'm releasing the mechanism.

2553
02:57:21,760 --> 02:57:23,760
Any docking mechanism.

2554
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:35,760
This?

2555
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:36,760
This?

2556
02:57:36,760 --> 02:57:38,760
Is this what you mean?

2557
02:57:38,760 --> 02:57:39,760
What?

2558
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:41,760
What glass tubes?

2559
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:42,760
These?

2560
02:57:42,760 --> 02:57:51,880
Oh, I see it. I see it. Hold on. Hold on. Okay. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just getting

2561
02:57:51,880 --> 02:57:56,640
a blood raid. I don't know. I had the right idea. Okay. I had the right idea. I had the

2562
02:57:56,640 --> 02:58:04,200
right idea. It's fine. It's fine. I had the right idea. I got confused. Have we? Elevator

2563
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:10,640
where? Okay. Show me that. Okay. I can breathe under wars. This is fine. I don't have to fight

2564
02:58:10,640 --> 02:58:21,360
anymore. This is a good news. I'm going to the elevator. Early, early elevator. The docking

2565
02:58:21,360 --> 02:58:31,720
tunnel. Yeah, you're getting reborn again. Hi. You ready, pumpkin pie? Oh, I got a sheep in.

2566
02:58:31,720 --> 02:58:49,680
I think you're a bit more agile than I am. Oh, I just got shivers. Oh, pest. Did you get

2567
02:58:49,680 --> 02:59:19,440
out? Did she at least get out? I hope she got out. Oh. That's the end of rapture. She

2568
02:59:19,440 --> 02:59:22,200
is on my rapture in the bottom of the sea.

2569
02:59:49,440 --> 03:00:16,120
Oh, she said look at me while you die. Oh my God, Eleanor. Oh, wait. No, she gave her

2570
03:00:16,120 --> 03:00:20,440
a rebreather. My bad. Sorry. She gave her a rebreather. Apologies. I thought she said

2571
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:29,240
look at me while you die. Sorry. Eleanor, why did you save Mrs. Lam as if she didn't just

2572
03:00:29,240 --> 03:00:38,360
send them like 10,000 souls and I'm blessed. The rapture dream is over, but in waking, I

2573
03:00:38,360 --> 03:00:45,760
am reborn. This world is not ready for me, yet here I am. It would be so easy to misjudge

2574
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:56,640
them. You are my conscience, father, and I need you to guide me. Don't don't do it. Don't do it. Ow. Ow. Oh, wait. I'm

2575
03:00:56,640 --> 03:01:08,080
going to sit. I'm going to be like in the back of her mind. I put my clothes on. Shit, I did die. Fuck.

2576
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:16,080
Oh, that was worth it, though. Eleanor's life. That was worth. Real untrue. It was worth.

2577
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:23,680
You will always be with me now, father. Your memories. Your drives. And when I need you,

2578
03:01:24,320 --> 03:01:34,400
you'll be there on my shoulder whispering. Okay, that's nice. Oh.

2579
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:48,880
Oh, there we go. Oh, there's the pumpkin spaces that we saved. Oh, hi, little pumpkins.

2580
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:59,440
Yes, I'm afraid my body's a bit broken at the moment.

2581
03:02:00,320 --> 03:02:03,680
But I did try my best.

2582
03:02:07,120 --> 03:02:16,080
You put me to see. Aw. If utopia is not a place, but a people, then we must choose carefully.

2583
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:24,560
Yeah. But a world is about to change. And in our story, rapture was just the beginning.

2584
03:02:25,040 --> 03:02:30,960
Yeah. Wait, what? I mean, I guess it was infinite, but wait, there's more. There's more to the tale

2585
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:41,840
of rapture, even though in what? Is that a good ending? There's always lightest, and then we go

2586
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:50,320
into the gaspar in the sky. You didn't die once during the entire game. Did I know? I thought I

2587
03:02:50,320 --> 03:02:59,360
did. Rapture part two DLC time. Is there an after credits? You're telling me. You're telling me.

2588
03:02:59,360 --> 03:03:06,720
Good job, mommy, I'm finishing it. We did it. Plot, plot, plot, plot, plot, plot, plot, plot, plot.

2589
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:11,280
Oh, we did it. Oh, my little pumpkin spaces got to go on.

2590
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:18,080
Sometimes I don't mind games that have a greater sacrifice thing behind it. You know,

2591
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:24,720
like, what's Daddy's job? Well, Daddy's job is to protect, and we helped protect and free from

2592
03:03:24,720 --> 03:03:37,040
the curse of Adam for the girl. Math 1618, thank you for the gifted membership. Congrats to those

2593
03:03:37,040 --> 03:03:50,000
who caught them with your face. Thank you. Thank you very much. Did Daddy ever even exist though?

2594
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:54,480
Wait, what? Am I having a schizophrenic episode? Is that not what the game was about?

2595
03:03:55,920 --> 03:04:03,200
All their show and concept are. Oh, my God. They copied me because I did my exposing

2596
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:08,880
viewers stream. I'm teasing, by the way. Did you like the game? I did. I'm interested in what

2597
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:17,360
Infinite is then, because Rapture, if I follow the plot along appropriately, I didn't Rapture

2598
03:04:17,360 --> 03:04:26,160
literally just Ka'Blamo. If you play Infinite, you play the DLC on Infinite as well, you should

2599
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:33,200
watch the art books. Play the DLC. It's called Minerva's Den. How long is it? Just like my Pintas.

2600
03:04:35,200 --> 03:04:38,560
Mummy Protect, Mummy Attack, but more importantly, Mummy Stack.

2601
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:45,120
Infinite is not Bioshock 3. Oh, it doesn't work. Wait, Bioshock 2 is the end of that plot line?

2602
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:51,360
Okay. No, Rapture's still there? Wait, so she only blew up Fontaine?

2603
03:04:51,360 --> 03:04:59,840
It's the bet. My Hot Tiggs, Infinite is the bit meant to, was the best.

2604
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:07,200
What? Four to eight hours long for the DLC? That's the whole last game.

2605
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:15,600
Or did I misunderstand? No, it takes two to three hours, okay. Minerva's Den is five hours.

2606
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:24,400
Infinite wasn't like it. Infinite is another storyline, okay.

2607
03:05:30,080 --> 03:05:34,480
I'm sorry about what you gave me a hard time. Remember when old games had long DLCs or good old

2608
03:05:34,480 --> 03:05:39,600
days? It's one of the best DLCs you'll ever play though. I think the timeline is infinite.

2609
03:05:39,600 --> 03:05:41,040
Infinite is prequel?

2610
03:05:44,320 --> 03:05:46,480
Infinite is more fast-paced on play.

2611
03:05:47,280 --> 03:05:48,320
Arrap! Arrap!

2612
03:05:50,880 --> 03:05:55,200
Someone said you get help on supplies, so I don't have to scavenge too much in Infinite.

2613
03:05:55,920 --> 03:06:01,920
Don't play Infinite on max difficulty. I mean, I played this one legendary and I did fine, so I don't

2614
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:14,640
see why not. Infinite is a polarizing game. I'm going to be honest, I do not know what polarizing

2615
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:22,800
means in this context. I personally enjoyed Infinite, but you can only turn your brain off

2616
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:29,360
because the story is really nonsensical. The director from Bioshock wanted to do a thing like

2617
03:06:29,360 --> 03:06:35,840
Final Fantasy. He wanted to make everything a different game with no connection. Bioshock too

2618
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:42,560
wasn't made by him. He's a top pro gamer. And usually means it's fun to see what you think of it.

2619
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:50,880
It means you love or you hate it. Oh, I wouldn't have even used that like that. Oh, thank you.

2620
03:06:50,880 --> 03:06:58,640
I have learned a new word in the context that you've used it. It means a shit. Okay, I can see where

2621
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:06,240
I bit. Bye. Thank you for the extended membership. Good job. Well, my lovely, lovely Terry.

2622
03:07:06,720 --> 03:07:13,840
Bioshock Infinite ended the franchise. Oh, so like, there's no more IPs. They were like,

2623
03:07:13,840 --> 03:07:19,280
we're done. We don't care. We're done so. Oh my god, it's the plans.

2624
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:30,320
Feels like the gameplay was a setback from two. So do we call you father now?

2625
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:36,240
I think I prefer mummy over daddy. I'm not sure daddy is.

2626
03:07:45,920 --> 03:07:48,400
There's a rumor of another, but the studio

2627
03:07:49,280 --> 03:07:53,840
perished. They're supposed to be making it. I think one in two needs a remaster.

2628
03:07:53,920 --> 03:08:01,760
I'm going to play Infinite and we might play Bioshock one again.

2629
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:07,680
I think it's a one sitting game. I can't remember. It's been a hot click.

2630
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:13,600
Bioshock Infinite was okay, but it's pretty different tone compared to the other games.

2631
03:08:13,600 --> 03:08:20,000
So don't go into a big mummy now. Wait, why am I big? Because I'm pregnant?

2632
03:08:20,160 --> 03:08:24,080
I'm not pregnant with Gen 2 yet.

2633
03:08:26,800 --> 03:08:28,640
Broly legend. Thank you for this picture.

2634
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:37,120
Oh, big mummy instead of big daddy. Got it. Thomas. Thomas. Are you squidding me right now?

2635
03:08:38,240 --> 03:08:43,200
I'm big mummy. Yeah, big fat arse. Mummy ready to sit on your face with that.

2636
03:08:43,200 --> 03:08:48,880
Puck Puck. Thank you for the extended membership. Gigi, daddy. Oh yeah.

2637
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:52,560
There is a new Bioshock game being made right now.

2638
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:56,720
They showed photos a few months ago. It takes place in the attic.

2639
03:08:56,720 --> 03:09:00,160
Play the DLC for Bioshock 2. It's better than Infinite.

2640
03:09:01,280 --> 03:09:10,720
Okay. Okay. Thank you, Blaze. If we're going to strap in, can I go get a cooler?

2641
03:09:13,920 --> 03:09:17,200
I may need to play Infinite so I can walk you through the game. Thank you.

2642
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:25,040
Your sacrifice is unironically so appreciated because my dumb ass can't figure that stuff out.

2643
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:33,840
Bioshock Infinite DLC runs out in the story. Sipping in and strapping on.

2644
03:09:34,880 --> 03:09:42,640
Mummy had told you I am 162 centimeters tall, which I believe is 5'2 in American units.

2645
03:09:43,440 --> 03:09:48,400
Don't make fun of me. I actually thought I was a regular height. Apparently I'm not.

2646
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:55,600
Apparently I'm tiny. Why isn't the cooler in the room right now? It's a refrigerator.

2647
03:09:57,680 --> 03:10:01,200
Did she say strap in to strap on? Either way, you're getting it because

2648
03:10:02,160 --> 03:10:09,840
I might be ordering the attachment that lets me take photos with the figurine attached to me.

2649
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:16,480
Oh, you want me to get a mini fridge? Mummy is portable. Head fat.

2650
03:10:17,280 --> 03:10:21,440
Just the right size to lie on my chest. My heart beat. Oh, that was so awesome.

2651
03:10:24,320 --> 03:10:26,960
High five, three, close to five, four. Oh, okay. Okay.

2652
03:10:27,760 --> 03:10:31,520
I told you I'm 172 centimeters. Are you squiddin' me right now?

2653
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:36,160
A recon crusader. Thank you for the extended membership. Don't worry,

2654
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:40,320
strongy. You're only like four inches below regular height or a little shorty. You know what

2655
03:10:40,320 --> 03:10:49,680
else is four inches? One of these. Do you want oppies, Mummy? Do you think you could lift me?

2656
03:10:50,480 --> 03:10:54,960
Actually, I've not weighed myself. I should post a picture of myself and be like,

2657
03:10:54,960 --> 03:11:01,840
by the way, this is so much I weigh. Didn't you say you're 153? I'm like pretty sure, Mum.

2658
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:06,080
I'm not fucking with myself right now.

2659
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:19,040
Probably. I mean, I might be 160. Oh, you've got me confused now. I don't know.

2660
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:28,960
Talk, Mummy, once in a while. Tell us the weight so we can train to carry you with one arm.

2661
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:34,640
I'll need to go. You're very low. I'm not. I'm actually heavy. I'm not kidding. I'm heavy.

2662
03:11:35,760 --> 03:11:44,240
You wouldn't. So the way fat stores in my body is on the gluteus maximus and around the thigh.

2663
03:11:44,240 --> 03:11:54,480
Wait, that's a muscle. No, around the derriere and around the thighs. So when I weigh myself,

2664
03:11:54,560 --> 03:11:58,160
and I'll tell you how much I weigh, but I think everyone's going to be surprised by how heavy

2665
03:11:58,160 --> 03:12:04,480
I am. I'm like heavy. I'm not, I'm not like a, I'm not a stick. I'm heavy. I just mean there's

2666
03:12:04,480 --> 03:12:13,040
an easier center of gravity on the trunk. Um, it's because of our gap. Actually, I think I might have

2667
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:20,720
in the cupboard. Right, I'll see if there's a cutscene. If not, we're going to quickly get a

2668
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:26,720
column. We'll play the DLC if I have it. Are you squiddin' me right now? Aw.

2669
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:44,880
Thank you, Stephen. Bucknick for the super chat. He, like 200, I don't know. Wait, is it extra?

2670
03:12:46,880 --> 03:12:49,920
Downloadable content. Play downloaded content.

2671
03:12:51,280 --> 03:12:56,720
Wait, there's two? Protectors, Trials and Minerva's Den.

2672
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:03,680
I want to know. Right, hold on. Right, I'm going to go get a column. I'm going to see if I can go

2673
03:13:03,680 --> 03:13:09,360
weigh myself, but um, basically look at the alt. Tell you what, I'll make you a deal. Go on the alt

2674
03:13:09,360 --> 03:13:17,280
Twitter. Guess how much, how heavy you think I am in LBs, okay? In LBs. You have to do it in pounds.

2675
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:23,920
Because we, well, I use stones. See, we use stones as the British, the British people

2676
03:13:23,920 --> 03:13:29,440
use stone, okay? So go come up with a number you think I weigh, and I'll go weigh myself in a

2677
03:13:29,440 --> 03:13:33,840
second, okay? I'll go get a cola as well, so give me a hot, hot second.

2678
03:15:17,280 --> 03:15:21,360
Right, I'm going to go convert it, and then I'll tape it. Oh no, I can't fucking tape it,

2679
03:15:21,360 --> 03:15:29,680
shit. Because I'm not signed in. I'm like, yeah, damn. Hold on. Hold on.

2680
03:15:36,480 --> 03:15:43,360
Hold on. I need to convert it. I need to convert it. Hold on. Oh, shit. No, it must be that way.

2681
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:49,120
Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Right.

2682
03:15:51,520 --> 03:15:53,920
What are the units? And then what's that in stone?

2683
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:59,440
Sorry, I'm going to say all three units. You're fucking welcome, by the way.

2684
03:16:02,960 --> 03:16:08,800
I'm converting everything for you. Okay. Now, if you, right, let's see what you're guessing.

2685
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:15,840
Ooh, ooh. Right, you're, ooh, someone got close. Someone got really close.

2686
03:16:17,760 --> 03:16:22,160
Okay, I'm going to say all the units. You can tape it. I can't tape it to you,

2687
03:16:22,160 --> 03:16:29,920
because I'm not signed in on my YouTube account. Okay, you ready? I turn up. 56 kilograms,

2688
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:37,600
123 pounds, or 8.7 stone. And it's all in my derriere.

2689
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:47,520
So, there you go. You guessed it. You are not heavy. Oh my, I think I'm heavy for my height, though.

2690
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:55,280
I'm one off. Let's go. That's not heavy. Oh, is it? Am I being dumb?

2691
03:16:55,840 --> 03:17:02,160
It's Johnny's 9% ass. Wait, I thought for my height chart. Wait, BMI scale. Let me look into

2692
03:17:02,160 --> 03:17:10,160
that BMI scale real quick. BMI scale, NHS. Give me that obesity. I don't know if maybe because

2693
03:17:10,160 --> 03:17:15,840
of my height, it, it, like, acts like I'm, like, mega fucking obese. I was like, fucking relax,

2694
03:17:15,840 --> 03:17:22,160
she's okay. That's light? Is that? Okay, what do I need to start now?

2695
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:33,520
Yes, I'm over 18. What the fuck, right? 163 kilograms. I'm 56.5. Why is that asking kilograms

2696
03:17:33,520 --> 03:17:40,720
on the fucking NHS? Wait, it's asking if I'm weight? It says, are you Middle Eastern? Sorry.

2697
03:17:40,960 --> 03:17:49,200
Sure. Sure. I'm a white pancake. What are you going to do about it? Oh, I'm in the healthy category.

2698
03:17:49,200 --> 03:17:57,920
Okay. My BMI is 21.1. BMI is unscientific. Your weight? I'm sorry you had to find out this way,

2699
03:17:57,920 --> 03:18:01,440
that I am paler than glass of milk. Yeah, that figures. There you go.

2700
03:18:01,520 --> 03:18:06,960
We can carry you bridal style with these.

2701
03:18:06,960 --> 03:18:08,880
Are you squiddin' me right now? I was so cute.

2702
03:18:11,920 --> 03:18:16,240
Thank you, the bitty lord, and thank you, Bleeding Reflinge 75. Why would we jump

2703
03:18:16,240 --> 03:18:22,000
at the same year? BMI has usefulness for population, but not for individuals. Yeah,

2704
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:29,200
I think if you're a bodybuilder, it completely messes you up. No chocolate mummy. I was,

2705
03:18:29,200 --> 03:18:35,520
I was heehawin' watchin' Azur's, eh Azur's, watchin' Sheeby's stream. So, I spoke to Sheeby

2706
03:18:35,520 --> 03:18:43,920
about this, and I was like, we at Vila, if you will, have accidentally stumbled into the most

2707
03:18:43,920 --> 03:18:52,560
diverse fucking team imaginable. You can't make it up. You honestly can't. I promise you,

2708
03:18:52,640 --> 03:18:58,800
fucking, do I, do I give a rat's fucking arse about meeting fucking quotas of variation

2709
03:18:58,800 --> 03:19:03,520
between folk? Do I give a fuck? No I don't. And I ended up with like the most diverse, like

2710
03:19:04,160 --> 03:19:09,120
gen mates, diverse team to work with, and all that jazz, like it's quite funny. I mean, I think

2711
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:14,720
it's funny, okay? Yeah, you're like a proper kid, with that weight, you can print, so I was carrying

2712
03:19:14,720 --> 03:19:20,640
the whole day. Eh, anyone with any real muscle masters BMI at the window, no such thing as a

2713
03:19:20,640 --> 03:19:26,880
brickie with a healthy BMI? Yeah, no. A Latina for gen two? Will she better apply? I'm fucking waiting.

2714
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:33,680
I wanna hear, I wanna hear the stun, I wanna hear, I wanna hear her go stronny when she says

2715
03:19:33,680 --> 03:19:45,040
my name. Yeah, yeah? Oh, you won't. Latina, come to me. I summon you Latina. Come to Vila.

2716
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:51,520
That's terrible, but also hilarious, equally. Shibi says we need a Latino. I mean, I need a little

2717
03:19:51,520 --> 03:20:04,720
spicy girl to teach me some Espanol toast. We need that. I think accent is definitely gonna be a bit

2718
03:20:04,720 --> 03:20:14,400
more desired. We need a bit of variation, you know? We've got our, we've got our Yopnik accent,

2719
03:20:14,400 --> 03:20:19,440
we've got, well, me, but I don't count. We've got Azura's absolutely fantastic voice,

2720
03:20:19,440 --> 03:20:26,640
Mercy's fantastic, Amy's fantastic, Shibi's fantastic. So, if and when gen two do get confirmed,

2721
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:31,200
now don't shoot the messenger, I'm just here for a good time. I'm just here to fucking jerk off later

2722
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:39,520
and post it, you know? An Asian Latina and in the Middle East. I have terrible news, if you're

2723
03:20:39,520 --> 03:20:46,880
wanting an Arabic girl, what we participate in is called Haram, and she will be stoned to death

2724
03:20:46,880 --> 03:20:55,520
by her family. So, no, we are not gonna be fucking participating in any of that shit. No, if you're

2725
03:20:55,520 --> 03:21:02,240
fucking Muslim, love you, but Jesus Christ knows that this is the most Haram against your religion

2726
03:21:02,240 --> 03:21:07,520
tape shit. Please do not touch us at the 10-foot pole, okay? Because holy fuck, you're gonna get an

2727
03:21:07,520 --> 03:21:13,520
eyelid. Yeah, I ain't fucking touching that shit. I ain't touching that shit. I'm saving you. I'm

2728
03:21:13,520 --> 03:21:19,600
doing you, inshallah, I'm doing you a favor, okay? Wallah will not allow it, okay? I prefer a live

2729
03:21:19,600 --> 03:21:26,240
girl as myself, okay? I am Haram, yes you are, but I could not recruit a girl non-full while she is

2730
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:36,000
you know, really, has religious ties, in that sense. Because holy fuck, I'd rather keep you alive

2731
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:42,640
around your family, that sort of thing. The link on the alt-twitter is broken already? Oh, right, I'm

2732
03:21:42,640 --> 03:21:49,680
gonna buy members, I'm gonna buy Elon Musk, you win. I'm buying premiums, so I can upload videos,

2733
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:53,040
and I'm gonna do that thing where Emmy linked with other stuff. I don't know how she did it,

2734
03:21:53,040 --> 03:21:56,960
I'm just gonna copy and paste what she did, because she's smart, okay? Can we just get a veal

2735
03:21:56,960 --> 03:22:01,280
asset for you all then? I mean, Azur is probably the one who'd probably end up with a veal asset,

2736
03:22:01,360 --> 03:22:08,720
just debate her father, surely he'll come around, absolutely not. Wait, how much do you weigh? I

2737
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:24,240
weigh 123 pounds, 56 kilograms, or 8.7 stone. Enjoy. If you need motivation for any lifting

2738
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:32,560
bros, not yourself. After you said you're height and weight, I can confidently say putting you

2739
03:22:32,560 --> 03:22:37,600
in a standing full Nelson would be easy for me. I didn't comprehend what you were communicating

2740
03:22:37,600 --> 03:22:46,960
there, okay, I get it now. I said 125, well, you got a good guess, man. 8.7 stoneys? Why would you

2741
03:22:46,960 --> 03:22:54,320
just say like over 20 LBs in that, literally, I can lift one there? I can't believe it,

2742
03:22:54,320 --> 03:22:59,280
how does the architect end up with so many lift bros? I mean, I can motivate you though,

2743
03:22:59,280 --> 03:23:07,840
don't think I won't. Okay, so for the DLC, am I doing protectors trials? Because that just

2744
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:16,080
sounds like an endless wave type of thing, which isn't quite for me. Minerva's den, sounds good to

2745
03:23:16,080 --> 03:23:28,400
me. Bro, I just don't doubt how much. Okay, I wish I could pin it. 56 kilograms, 123 pounds,

2746
03:23:29,120 --> 03:23:38,240
or 8.7 stone. And then go on the alt Twitter and tell me where all that weight is. That's right,

2747
03:23:38,240 --> 03:23:44,240
I'm getting my ego stroked because I'm stroking myself. Stop, stop, I'm excited, okay, I'm

2748
03:23:44,240 --> 03:23:48,880
all really, and I'm having a good time, I'm having a lot of fun playing with you. Okay, I'm getting

2749
03:23:48,880 --> 03:23:59,760
a bit excited. Protector trials is not worth it. Okay, right, you heard it here first, Minerva's den,

2750
03:23:59,760 --> 03:24:11,360
and we go. Oh, DLC time, DLC time. But steel is heavier than feathers.

2751
03:24:14,800 --> 03:24:21,520
Rapture, central computing, start Minerva's den, select a difficulty, I'm new to shooters.

2752
03:24:23,360 --> 03:24:29,840
Are we getting a test at the end of the stream? Yeah, sure. 120 lb is ass and the rest is my body,

2753
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:42,240
that's funny. Please don't copyright, oh, please don't copyright. Okay, it's late, rest well, sleep

2754
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:50,400
well. Hey, apparently I'm fanboy height. Liar, you little cod gamer you. 1968 Rapture,

2755
03:24:50,400 --> 03:24:54,880
are we gonna get nice Rapture? Are we gonna finally see a knife?

2756
03:24:58,160 --> 03:25:02,160
Minerva's den. Subject to Sigma is approaching Minerva's den.

2757
03:25:02,880 --> 03:25:08,320
Oh, no. Wait, what?

2758
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:18,800
Sorry, I'm too much of a brain, what? I just see Sigma on my brain, it's like, I see Sigma.

2759
03:25:21,520 --> 03:25:30,000
Sometime later. Okay, rest well, don't sleep, goodnight kiss, sleep well. Sweet dream.

2760
03:25:33,120 --> 03:25:34,720
Uh, what the Sigma?

2761
03:25:41,360 --> 03:25:46,240
Get that starfish off of me, I gotta go take a shower, I need to shower to Agile.

2762
03:25:48,560 --> 03:25:50,880
I was like, should have put deodorant on, I'm like, now it's too late.

2763
03:25:53,440 --> 03:25:57,280
Okay, so we're a daddy.

2764
03:26:02,800 --> 03:26:03,280
Okay.

2765
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:12,400
Hello, Mr. Sigma. Oh, no, my name's actually Sigma. The name's Porter.

2766
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:19,360
Oh, Dr. Tenenbaum tells me you're here to help us get the thinker out of Rapture.

2767
03:26:19,360 --> 03:26:22,640
I'm actually called Sigma, but nothing worth doing ever is.

2768
03:26:23,600 --> 03:26:25,920
You should be able to get inside through an airlock.

2769
03:26:26,480 --> 03:26:28,000
I'm actually called Sigma.

2770
03:26:31,200 --> 03:26:32,160
Yeah, the ad.

2771
03:26:35,360 --> 03:26:37,600
Is there more secret sea slug?

2772
03:26:39,120 --> 03:26:40,320
Secret sea slug.

2773
03:26:41,520 --> 03:26:44,080
Or accurate, is it absolute Sigma grain set?

2774
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:48,240
What's that, you thought the streamer would go offline after completing the game?

2775
03:26:48,240 --> 03:26:52,400
No, I built the DLC because I'm on that Sigma grain set.

2776
03:26:52,400 --> 03:26:53,120
Amen.

2777
03:26:53,680 --> 03:26:56,640
I'm stuck. Oh, God, sorry, I'm stuck.

2778
03:26:59,680 --> 03:27:04,240
Uh, I assume it's the same mechanic. I just don't have a wean.

2779
03:27:08,560 --> 03:27:11,920
Is there anything here that I need to spot before I jump in?

2780
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:13,920
No.

2781
03:27:16,320 --> 03:27:20,160
Dr. Stony Sigma, I'm so sorry, but you've been diagnosed with Sigma.

2782
03:27:20,160 --> 03:27:21,840
I'm just gonna have to suffer this.

2783
03:27:24,080 --> 03:27:27,360
Sorry, I am very happy right now.

2784
03:27:27,360 --> 03:27:32,000
I, like, I feel accomplished. I figured out the game, I completed it,

2785
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:37,040
and we're doing the DLC together and never just get to chill out at the same time.

2786
03:27:44,720 --> 03:27:47,280
I only have telekinesis and drill.

2787
03:27:54,080 --> 03:27:58,080
Okay.

2788
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:03,280
So we're starting with nothing, which is okay. We're allowed to start with nothing.

2789
03:28:06,560 --> 03:28:07,280
What's that?

2790
03:28:12,720 --> 03:28:15,920
You've been done half a movement, half a decent.

2791
03:28:16,960 --> 03:28:21,360
I'm rather scared. I don't like the ambience. I want to feel underpowered again.

2792
03:28:23,120 --> 03:28:26,800
I congratulate you on the founding of Rapture Central Computing.

2793
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:32,640
The Great Chain only grows stronger with each pair of hands laid upon it.

2794
03:28:32,640 --> 03:28:33,680
What?

2795
03:28:33,680 --> 03:28:39,760
I trust that you and I will choose to pull Rapture in the same direction.

2796
03:28:41,920 --> 03:28:49,520
I am rather scared. I'm not. I don't feel strong anymore. I don't feel empowered.

2797
03:28:53,680 --> 03:29:05,520
I'm actually really pretty scared right now.

2798
03:29:06,640 --> 03:29:10,400
Right, so there are, right, I don't have a camera, so I can't, like, level up.

2799
03:29:11,920 --> 03:29:18,400
Oh, it's a robot. I ain't doing math. It took me long enough to...

2800
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:26,240
Uh, I guess we just go wherever.

2801
03:29:27,920 --> 03:29:30,080
What steps into Minerva's den?

2802
03:29:30,080 --> 03:29:30,400
Me?

2803
03:29:30,400 --> 03:29:31,840
Or there's no a story?

2804
03:29:31,840 --> 03:29:32,480
Yeah.

2805
03:29:32,480 --> 03:29:33,920
What's the thinker for himself?

2806
03:29:35,280 --> 03:29:39,360
But you see, old friend, the machine has chosen me.

2807
03:29:40,960 --> 03:29:43,600
Okay, I guess we can die sometimes at a save station.

2808
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:46,000
Let me just save real quick.

2809
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:55,600
property of read well main

2810
03:30:05,360 --> 03:30:06,880
So I can only melee right now?

2811
03:30:07,120 --> 03:30:10,720
He can't.

2812
03:30:13,280 --> 03:30:17,600
Read wall. He and I founded Rapture Central computing together,

2813
03:30:17,600 --> 03:30:20,400
but the greedy bastard pushed me out years ago.

2814
03:30:21,360 --> 03:30:26,960
Splicers, the security. He pulls the strings in Minerva's den now.

2815
03:30:26,960 --> 03:30:32,960
Oh.

2816
03:30:36,960 --> 03:30:43,360
Hi, Stronny. I haven't been a fan for very long, so in catching up on all your videos and Patreon

2817
03:30:43,360 --> 03:30:50,240
audios, your grooming audio has to be your best one. Never thought my tentacle would react to a

2818
03:30:50,240 --> 03:30:52,880
Scottish last term need to appear in the audience.

2819
03:30:54,080 --> 03:30:54,960
I'm not sure.

2820
03:30:57,120 --> 03:31:02,080
I'm so sorry. That sentence is so wildly inappropriate, but it's hilarious.

2821
03:31:02,880 --> 03:31:05,040
Thank you, Anon, for the tip.

2822
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:09,360
Literally, your grooming audio is the best one yet, for fuck's sake.

2823
03:31:10,480 --> 03:31:18,160
For anyone who hasn't consumed it, one, relax. It's me. Two, relax. Okay, that's absolutely hilarious.

2824
03:31:18,160 --> 03:31:21,680
Well, you like me calling you an idiot while like violently writing you?

2825
03:31:22,720 --> 03:31:26,480
I can do more of that. That is what your tentacle is going on.

2826
03:31:26,480 --> 03:31:29,360
But thank you for the tip, Anon. It's absolutely hilarious.

2827
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:32,240
A laser?

2828
03:31:35,120 --> 03:31:35,520
Okay.

2829
03:31:42,240 --> 03:31:43,280
Please, yeah.

2830
03:31:44,000 --> 03:31:46,800
You fucking idiot. Just beat me all right, fuck.

2831
03:32:02,160 --> 03:32:07,120
I don't know what I'm doing after this stream.

2832
03:32:07,840 --> 03:32:10,080
I don't know what I should say.

2833
03:32:12,160 --> 03:32:15,520
Because normally I go like super non-verbal.

2834
03:32:16,640 --> 03:32:24,640
I don't know how I managed to muster up the ability to speak at the end of the...

2835
03:32:25,920 --> 03:32:28,000
Whoa, stop, stop. You're scaring me.

2836
03:32:31,520 --> 03:32:31,840
What?

2837
03:32:32,640 --> 03:32:34,960
Ah, what the heck, man?

2838
03:32:39,440 --> 03:32:42,000
What? Wait, was that the one I was supposed to do?

2839
03:32:43,680 --> 03:32:45,600
Are you trying to bring us with you when you go?

2840
03:32:52,480 --> 03:32:56,480
I don't... Wait, is that the one with the ability to use fake gaming?

2841
03:33:02,640 --> 03:33:05,920
Are you squiddling me right now?

2842
03:33:19,920 --> 03:33:21,440
And now it's your turn.

2843
03:33:25,200 --> 03:33:27,120
That's why I keep getting save stations.

2844
03:33:27,520 --> 03:33:28,720
You're gonna make me scared.

2845
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:32,880
Thank you, tiny spainy. I'm coming for you.

2846
03:33:41,200 --> 03:33:42,720
One second, I need a fart on her.

2847
03:33:47,840 --> 03:33:52,000
That was really loud. That was going to pick up on me.

2848
03:33:53,920 --> 03:33:55,520
Sorry, I'm all scared again.

2849
03:33:58,080 --> 03:34:01,600
I'm all scared again because I'm not, um...

2850
03:34:06,400 --> 03:34:07,360
That was too early.

2851
03:34:09,280 --> 03:34:13,120
I'm all scared again because I'm not strong.

2852
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:22,000
Mr. Ryan hired me to build a computer that could keep an entire city running on time.

2853
03:34:22,640 --> 03:34:25,920
The Rapture Operational Data Interpreter Network.

2854
03:34:26,560 --> 03:34:28,800
Folks call it the thinker for sure.

2855
03:34:28,800 --> 03:34:34,080
Oh, the spear key to come R-word you. Sorry, got it, got it, got it.

2856
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:36,400
Sorry, I thought you meant actually N-game key.

2857
03:34:36,400 --> 03:34:41,680
I was like, uh, the spear key to come get you. Sorry!

2858
03:34:41,680 --> 03:34:48,880
Another reasoning processor it may finally think for itself if Duran could see me now.

2859
03:34:52,560 --> 03:34:56,720
So, there are little sisters in this room?

2860
03:34:56,720 --> 03:35:01,440
Tenning Bomb can provide you with a bonus Sonic if you complete the protector trails.

2861
03:35:01,440 --> 03:35:04,160
Complete all the trails then return to the garden.

2862
03:35:05,600 --> 03:35:06,400
Okay, so I...

2863
03:35:11,680 --> 03:35:18,240
Those vacuum bots sucked up all sorts of things before they went on the fritz.

2864
03:35:18,800 --> 03:35:21,600
Crack one open and you might find something you can use.

2865
03:35:26,400 --> 03:35:26,880
Sorry, I'm...

2866
03:35:34,320 --> 03:35:36,320
Hmm? Excuse me?

2867
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:42,560
I can hear him slamming around over there.

2868
03:35:52,080 --> 03:35:55,280
Are you squidding me right now? Sorry, this is freaking out.

2869
03:35:55,280 --> 03:35:59,040
Mama, I really liked your SPH audio the most.

2870
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:03,840
I don't want to be too selfish, but another one of those would be really nice.

2871
03:36:03,840 --> 03:36:05,360
You are really good at being mean to us briefly.

2872
03:36:05,360 --> 03:36:07,360
I don't think it's so hard to be mean.

2873
03:36:08,320 --> 03:36:10,400
No, I don't want to explore into the enemy.

2874
03:36:10,400 --> 03:36:13,200
I mean, I can definitely make another one, but I don't mean...

2875
03:36:13,200 --> 03:36:17,760
That felt really mean, but I mean, shit, if you enjoyed the mission completely.

2876
03:36:20,400 --> 03:36:23,200
What would they do if I did another PPT anyone?

2877
03:36:23,200 --> 03:36:26,480
I can hear someone walking around, unless it's my squelching feet.

2878
03:36:27,520 --> 03:36:27,760
Then...

2879
03:36:27,760 --> 03:36:31,760
No.

2880
03:36:49,760 --> 03:36:53,120
We feelings like the T's then? I did feel it was me.

2881
03:36:53,120 --> 03:36:55,120
But if you like it, then it's different, you know?

2882
03:36:55,440 --> 03:36:59,040
The thinker knows you're not the thinker.

2883
03:37:00,800 --> 03:37:03,520
I hear a squishing around, but I'm starting to think it's Mafia here.

2884
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:09,120
Okay, it's my squishing around down here.

2885
03:37:09,440 --> 03:37:10,100
Oh, my amazigh!

2886
03:37:23,100 --> 03:37:27,180
OK, I'm just curious just what the fuck I'm doing here.

2887
03:37:39,120 --> 03:37:46,960
okay that hack tool should come in handy head back up to my office head back up to

2888
03:37:46,960 --> 03:37:52,480
my office I am both of them

2889
03:37:53,320 --> 03:38:01,800
oh no our chat's frozen wait is it better not be

2890
03:38:04,960 --> 03:38:08,480

2891
03:38:09,640 --> 03:38:15,880
are we good you're making me pan do you mean audio then do aftercare

2892
03:38:15,880 --> 03:38:20,840
server and feels better yeah that's probably just on screen

2893
03:38:24,800 --> 03:38:32,040
this is my nervous day I have to agree with that last tipper

2894
03:38:32,040 --> 03:38:38,000
strony sometimes gives me sundry vibes strony gave her fans the tools to groom

2895
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:43,840
her girls but left herself out on purpose keeping her reflames guessing

2896
03:38:43,840 --> 03:38:52,360
Ali what I get satisfaction from is like fulfilling your fantasy that's what

2897
03:38:52,360 --> 03:38:57,760
gives me the ultimate satisfaction like not being weird about it but I do

2898
03:38:57,760 --> 03:39:04,640
genuinely like it thank you darling gale Tia and a anonymous for the tips I

2899

2902
03:39:28,280 --> 03:39:42,600

2903
03:39:42,600 --> 03:39:56,400
thinker what if I do the other people's fancy I just like it that way cuz it's

2904
03:39:56,400 --> 03:40:00,720

2905
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:05,640
I'd rather give you what you want you know because I get more satisfaction when

2906
03:40:05,640 --> 03:40:09,640

2907
03:40:09,640 --> 03:40:12,440
audio like that

2908
03:40:13,360 --> 03:40:16,200
that

2909
03:40:17,200 --> 03:40:21,600
well splicers haven't gotten into my office thanks to the thinker's security

2910
03:40:21,600 --> 03:40:30,000

2916
03:41:28,520 --> 03:41:32,120
circle and I'm damned proud to be a part of it

2917
03:41:32,160 --> 03:41:45,260
don't fell down that first year in London working for

2918
03:41:45,260 --> 03:41:47,260
Oh

2919
03:42:01,020 --> 03:42:03,020
Hardly

2920
03:42:09,540 --> 03:42:11,780
Sorry, I almost picked up my call-offs

2921
03:42:11,780 --> 03:42:19,100
No, leave my robot alone. Why don't you just fly up bumblebee? I have to admit

2922
03:42:21,140 --> 03:42:23,660
You're being rather silly right now bumblebee

2923
03:42:25,860 --> 03:42:27,860
He was a brilliant engineer

2924
03:42:28,580 --> 03:42:33,860
We saw eye-to-eye once long ago, but the splicing made him paranoid

2925
03:42:35,180 --> 03:42:38,660
Delusional he'd murder us both to keep the thinker here

2926
03:42:42,180 --> 03:42:47,420
All right, come on bumblebee. We've got some baddies to kill

2927
03:42:48,260 --> 03:42:50,260
Strongest really wave material

2928
03:42:51,260 --> 03:42:53,260
Shit's way

2929
03:42:56,820 --> 03:43:00,060
Unless inking makes up for it press stand up. Yeah

2930
03:43:02,620 --> 03:43:04,620
Something's going on over there

2931
03:43:04,620 --> 03:43:09,740
Puppy thinks she has all the power here well, she does it's over boys

2932
03:43:09,860 --> 03:43:14,400
I would say save yourselves, but it's probably already too late for you to

2933
03:43:16,300 --> 03:43:18,300
Thank you the very Lord oh

2934
03:43:19,700 --> 03:43:24,820
So I do have the power wait, I like that. No, no keep talking. I like that

2935
03:43:27,620 --> 03:43:31,660
Quick save quick save I'm quick saving. Why is there a fight about to happen?

2936
03:43:32,660 --> 03:43:38,340
I've got him so nervous. I don't know what comes of the head search containers for loot. I mean I'm flying

2937
03:43:38,940 --> 03:43:45,180
I'm just not very good at it. Wait, did I complete a challenge or no, sorry, I'll figure out I

2938
03:43:46,820 --> 03:43:48,820
Don't need saving. I love it here

2939
03:43:53,820 --> 03:43:58,340
Is I just here sorry my smell just go wait off my face so fast when I heard that daddy

2940
03:43:58,980 --> 03:44:00,980
I'm not really the parish daddy

2941
03:44:02,580 --> 03:44:06,980
The Lancer is the most technically advanced big daddy that rapture ever produced

2942
03:44:08,340 --> 03:44:12,260
Between you and the little sisters, and if there's anywhere that you

2943
03:44:26,700 --> 03:44:33,460
Can I just sunlock him, please so he doesn't hit me at all. I think he's even a bumblebee, you know that

2944
03:44:34,300 --> 03:44:36,300
I

2945
03:44:37,900 --> 03:44:43,980
Fucking mail in each other today. Ow. Hold on

2946
03:44:46,180 --> 03:44:48,180
Ow

2947
03:44:48,380 --> 03:44:51,940
No, no, I don't have any ammo. I don't want to waste my laser beam on them

2948
03:44:57,700 --> 03:44:59,700
A little sister can I be saved?

2949
03:45:04,340 --> 03:45:07,780
This one is my savior if I accidentally start a road

2950
03:45:10,380 --> 03:45:12,900
I don't want to play this game mechanic anymore

2951
03:45:15,020 --> 03:45:17,020
Like I

2952
03:45:18,660 --> 03:45:22,980
Know I know this is the core mechanic

2953
03:45:24,580 --> 03:45:27,780
But I'd rather produce the all audio right now

2954
03:45:33,460 --> 03:45:35,460
I

2955
03:45:51,500 --> 03:45:56,700
Don't you make an audio of you hypnotizing us into thinking we can't move our bodies

2956
03:45:56,700 --> 03:46:05,420
Kinda like sleep paralysis I would love to see what an obsessed straw me cuddles looks like I'm talking mercy levels of obsessed

2957
03:46:27,580 --> 03:46:35,060
I hold on hold on my inbox in shape, then you mind me

2958
03:46:48,140 --> 03:46:50,140
I literally

2959
03:46:51,620 --> 03:46:53,620
This is not going well

2960
03:46:54,460 --> 03:46:56,460
I

2961
03:47:08,580 --> 03:47:13,820
Never talk about expensive gasoline ever again, you still got telekinesis. Do you need to eat yet?

2962
03:47:16,300 --> 03:47:18,780
Right, all right, let me push up

2963
03:47:18,780 --> 03:47:24,260
Why don't you make an audio of you hypnotizing us to thinking we can't move our bodies like I would love to see what an

2964
03:47:24,860 --> 03:47:27,100
Obsessed Johnny Cuddles looks like with me

2965
03:47:29,580 --> 03:47:31,580
Is that

2966
03:47:32,500 --> 03:47:38,180
Is that wholesome or is that I get to do wherever I want to you type of audio

2967
03:47:38,820 --> 03:47:41,300
What one is that anonymous you didn't specify?

2968
03:47:44,180 --> 03:47:46,180
And everyone just said the money capacity

2969
03:47:48,780 --> 03:47:52,940
I'm also thinking it's the enemy watch along safe. Can she read for four hours? Oh

2970
03:47:53,860 --> 03:47:57,500
Wait Danny to oh and I've even thought about that

2971
03:47:58,180 --> 03:48:02,420
Or is it dubs or subs are we doing for the enemy watch along?

2972
03:48:08,500 --> 03:48:15,900
I never even thought that far ahead and I just remembered on that side of the community everyone goes absolutely apeshit over the

2973
03:48:16,140 --> 03:48:18,140
dubs and subs

2974
03:48:18,180 --> 03:48:23,140
It's only in Japanese. Oh, well, there you go. That's the sort then right no one can argue about it

2975
03:48:23,140 --> 03:48:25,460
We're doing some subtitles no one can argue

2976
03:48:27,660 --> 03:48:29,660
You might struggle with the subtitles

2977
03:48:32,380 --> 03:48:35,500
Yes, but is that gonna stop me

2978
03:48:38,340 --> 03:48:41,860
Sometimes I have sometimes I have an ability to read or not

2979
03:48:42,540 --> 03:48:45,900
It's up to you if you do something to stop. Okay, I think we're doing stuff. Thank goodness

2980
03:48:45,900 --> 03:48:51,980
I thought of choosing an enemy. Well, I picked another one. Oh, I've already forgotten the name of it

2981
03:48:52,780 --> 03:48:57,220
There's another enemy called like VV something I

2982
03:48:58,260 --> 03:49:02,260
I don't know if you guys will be more familiar than than it than me

2983
03:49:04,180 --> 03:49:07,340
And no one can argue it you can you underestimate this community

2984
03:49:07,340 --> 03:49:09,780
I'll be up to you if you can't find some and just think of them

2985
03:49:09,780 --> 03:49:12,300
They're called push being able to read less likely than you think

2986
03:49:12,300 --> 03:49:17,860
I don't know if you guys know what anime it is. It's like called like VV something I or something like that. It's really short

2987
03:49:18,460 --> 03:49:20,460
It's not too long. Oh

2988
03:49:21,340 --> 03:49:24,680
My god, you guys are such weebs. Yes. Oh

2989
03:49:25,340 --> 03:49:32,760
VV Florae I song that's it. That's the one that's what I picked for next month if the watch along goes well

2990
03:49:33,100 --> 03:49:39,540
You little fucking weebs. I love you. Oh shit. You guys are perfect me like VV. I you know that V tripper

2991
03:49:39,540 --> 03:49:41,540
She got her own anime

2992
03:49:41,780 --> 03:49:47,020
I got recommended. Mommy, I would submit my mind and surrender my body to you

2993
03:49:47,020 --> 03:49:50,460
I mean, if I'm gonna hit most of this audio you might not even

2994
03:49:50,980 --> 03:49:55,540
I might just take over your mind. You don't even need to submit, you know what I'm saying? Just let me in

2995
03:49:57,660 --> 03:50:02,340
Based off how often you read a comment fully correct

2996
03:50:02,340 --> 03:50:09,300
This might be difficult me like confused with the plot like what's cool? Why is the plot suddenly bearing also?

2997
03:50:09,300 --> 03:50:12,700
Me right who reads like clothes is some other word which I've already forgotten

2998
03:50:13,260 --> 03:50:20,340
My Xbox just turned itself on again Xbox turn on or turn off. I don't know. I can't remember. There used to be a big prank

2999
03:50:20,700 --> 03:50:25,220
Have no resistant bros. It's over for us. No, I want to do a break you down

3000
03:50:25,220 --> 03:50:27,220
Can I do where I break you?

3001
03:50:28,500 --> 03:50:34,220
I've got the forget your name screen coming up soon, so I'll be interested to see how that goes

3002
03:50:35,220 --> 03:50:37,820
So any can do whatever she

3003
03:50:40,100 --> 03:50:44,740
Xbox twist this much balls. No, we're not twisting bollocks out here, right?

3004
03:50:44,940 --> 03:50:49,340
Can I say something controversial and you're gonna hate me for it, okay? I

3005
03:50:51,380 --> 03:50:54,180
Thoroughly enjoy this game. I'm loving it

3006
03:50:55,300 --> 03:51:00,540
We will possibly return to the DLC in a future stream

3007
03:51:01,460 --> 03:51:02,780
and

3008
03:51:02,780 --> 03:51:08,580
Strongly fist the reflin a smart more likely than you think says one of my kings. Um, I

3009
03:51:09,060 --> 03:51:14,620
Won't do I won't make it. Okay. I won't make it. I want to do it. I wanted to do a four-part series

3010
03:51:15,540 --> 03:51:17,540
I'm not sure I'm allowed to make it

3011
03:51:18,140 --> 03:51:19,420
and

3012
03:51:19,420 --> 03:51:24,340
Yes, I didn't anticipate playing the DLC. So my brain was like over finish the game

3013
03:51:24,340 --> 03:51:30,260
You be okay, but we'll come back to the DLC because you guys recommend it. So we'll do our layer day. Okay, and I

3014
03:51:31,020 --> 03:51:37,300
Think it was a great game. I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the game. I enjoyed the story. I enjoyed the lore

3015
03:51:37,300 --> 03:51:44,060
I can't believe Eleanor actually saved her mum like her rude as if I didn't just go through hell and earth to you know

3016
03:51:44,060 --> 03:51:46,220
Grab her and save her and all that like

3017
03:51:47,140 --> 03:51:52,140
Controversial oh sugar. I don't have my password. So I can't redirect

3018
03:51:54,860 --> 03:51:59,740
Danny to go and turn my other PC on and redirect into it

3019
03:52:01,260 --> 03:52:06,420
No, is it true I might have to

3020
03:52:08,620 --> 03:52:10,860
You got the best ending so it's pretty good

3021
03:52:12,340 --> 03:52:15,820
She's not logged in literally. I can't fucking do anything

3022
03:52:23,860 --> 03:52:29,220
Since you said you wanted to know what we wanted we want a lovey-dovey breeding wife or do you really?

3023
03:52:30,620 --> 03:52:32,620
That sounds cute

3024
03:52:34,180 --> 03:52:38,600
Whoa, enjoy it whoa hate that third hate that third arm that's embarrassing

3025
03:52:38,600 --> 03:52:40,760
Get out of here. Hold on. Let me get rid of that real quick. Oh

3026
03:52:41,900 --> 03:52:43,900
my

3027
03:52:44,220 --> 03:52:46,220
Studios is crashing

3028
03:52:47,340 --> 03:52:50,740
And it's completely broke. Okay, uh gonna be honest

3029
03:52:50,740 --> 03:52:56,580
I can't actually move myself or remove the asset because my vTubing studio has crashed

3030
03:52:57,780 --> 03:52:59,780
But you can still see me. So that's the good news

3031
03:53:00,260 --> 03:53:02,580
So i'm gonna save you save

3032
03:53:03,860 --> 03:53:05,860
And then we'll come back

3033
03:53:06,100 --> 03:53:07,860
I will pause

3034
03:53:07,860 --> 03:53:13,780
And then I'll pause this in hopes that it's gonna fix my vTub studio or I may just

3035
03:53:15,380 --> 03:53:17,460
Oh that oh something's happening

3036
03:53:19,300 --> 03:53:20,660
Uh

3037
03:53:20,660 --> 03:53:25,300
Wow, are you happy to irradiate it stony honestly? It's literally a bug in there

3038
03:53:25,940 --> 03:53:26,980

Cynthia

3052
03:54:11,700 --> 03:54:13,540

3059
03:55:00,980 --> 03:55:03,620
Hold on let me let me task manager real quick

3060
03:55:03,620 --> 03:55:05,620

03:55:13,220 --> 03:55:17,860
Something's happening. Hold on. Oh, what the fuck is that on my screen?

3062
03:55:22,580 --> 03:55:28,740
Can you see that on stream as well? Oh you can what the fuck is that? What is that?

3063
03:55:30,420 --> 03:55:32,420
Hmm

3064
03:55:32,820 --> 03:55:38,580
What is that symbol on my screen? Do you know what that can you see that? Yes, you can see that. What is that?

3065
03:55:41,220 --> 03:55:47,700
Huh, I should be because I don't know. I'm concerned as well if I've been banned

3066
03:55:51,700 --> 03:55:53,060
Um

3067
03:55:53,060 --> 03:55:58,980
It's ink loading. Okay. I'm gonna just leave it and do this thing over there. Oh, is that my ooloo market asset? No

3068
03:55:58,980 --> 03:56:00,660
What can he be?

3069
03:56:00,660 --> 03:56:02,660
Is that ooloo market asset?

3070
03:56:02,980 --> 03:56:04,980
By the way, I have merch at ooloo market

3071
03:56:07,700 --> 03:56:09,700
What are you?

3072
03:56:10,260 --> 03:56:13,780
Sorry, I'm going to try and identify what it is. Oh

3073
03:56:15,300 --> 03:56:17,300
You don't know what it was. It was fuji tech

3074
03:56:17,860 --> 03:56:21,780
It was teaser for gen four. Oh my god. You've got me. It's a mountain literally

3075
03:56:22,340 --> 03:56:25,540
You're getting hacked prepare for big daddy to arrive. Uh, we're gonna

3076
03:56:25,940 --> 03:56:29,300
Should I call you big daddy in the audio? What should I say in this audio?

3077
03:56:29,620 --> 03:56:36,420
As I said, normally I get super quiet when I'm recording it like you gotta let them know use code strutty 10% I'll give you some

3078
03:56:37,540 --> 03:56:39,140
literally

3079
03:56:39,140 --> 03:56:41,140
No, the copy and paste and you got the

3080
03:56:42,180 --> 03:56:44,180
The reflans name

3081
03:56:44,180 --> 03:56:46,180
You got the reflans name in the message

3082
03:56:46,900 --> 03:56:48,740
um

3083
03:56:48,740 --> 03:56:50,340
Okay

3084
03:56:50,340 --> 03:56:53,380
Yeah, you want me to call you big daddy like unironically though

3085
03:56:56,500 --> 03:56:58,500
Put a baby in me big daddy

3086
03:56:59,380 --> 03:57:02,500
Get a bit too spicy get a bit too spicy for youtube now. Hold on a minute

3087
03:57:04,340 --> 03:57:07,780
Because so when I'm recording I'm like it's super non-verbal just because

3088
03:57:08,500 --> 03:57:13,380
You know subspace and all that I'd I very I can't really

3089
03:57:13,940 --> 03:57:16,900
Myself and be like, oh, I'm so dominant right now. Like no, no

3090
03:57:17,060 --> 03:57:19,060
Oh

3091
03:57:19,300 --> 03:57:26,900
I'm probably what I'll do is I'm gonna brain roll up calling us big daddy will fart. Oh hell. Yes the non-verbal is

3092
03:57:28,020 --> 03:57:32,740
Um, oh, I need to ask. What do you think about the recording situation?

3093
03:57:32,980 --> 03:57:40,340
So I use my 3d o and one side is pointed to me and the other side of the 3d o is pointed to the floor wink wink

3094
03:57:40,580 --> 03:57:42,580
Does that make sense?

3095
03:57:42,900 --> 03:57:48,580
Do I keep that set up or would you rather like I put the 3d o in front of me or

3096
03:57:51,060 --> 03:57:53,060
No, you're happy with the system

3097
03:57:56,180 --> 03:58:01,380
You know for someone that finds the way she says daddy cringe a little well, are you gonna breathe me daddy?

3098
03:58:03,540 --> 03:58:05,540
You're farting my eating your mother for that

3099
03:58:06,420 --> 03:58:07,540
I

3100
03:58:07,540 --> 03:58:14,500
Sounded good sounds fine. Whatever's comfy. Yeah, I basically have to lie back on my chair so it balances on my chest a little better

3101
03:58:15,860 --> 03:58:17,860
She'd be oriented

3102
03:58:18,900 --> 03:58:23,060
Please woman. I got a word clear. Oh, what's wrong daddy? You don't want to play?

3103
03:58:27,220 --> 03:58:34,420
This is why you can't give me this is why you cannot tell me the truth because I start pushing the envelope or envelope more and more

3104
03:58:36,020 --> 03:58:38,020
You

3105
03:58:39,620 --> 03:58:41,620
We can hear your heartbeat in it

3106
03:58:43,060 --> 03:58:47,700
How loud are you listening? I didn't hear that heartbeat when I went through

3107
03:58:48,980 --> 03:58:51,140
It's because it's placed on my chest, so I guess

3108
03:58:53,060 --> 03:58:58,660
Maybe it'll take forever for it. Well, I need to brain roll first. I need to like check out mentally first

3109
03:58:59,620 --> 03:59:01,620
Let me bring

3110
03:59:03,220 --> 03:59:07,780
Stony wants me to produce nothing but dust crank that volume literally prank. I'm John

3111
03:59:08,980 --> 03:59:11,700
So when do you feel send the envelope?

3112
03:59:12,500 --> 03:59:18,500
So what I normally do after stream is a brain rot for like an hour. I just clock out. I don't interact with anything

3113
03:59:19,220 --> 03:59:22,100
Just pass though. Although I do take a look at marshmallows, too

3114
03:59:22,580 --> 03:59:27,540
Um, there's nice me flins that say this stream was really nice even when it was shirt and I'm like

3115
03:59:28,660 --> 03:59:30,660
Oh

3116
03:59:30,900 --> 03:59:32,500
Um

3117
03:59:32,500 --> 03:59:34,500
Frank this little job owner you

3118
03:59:35,140 --> 03:59:37,140
I like the heartbeat

3119
03:59:37,700 --> 03:59:39,540
Not even

3120
03:59:39,540 --> 03:59:44,100
Oh, no, the Emily and Vigo come get a pet off me and all that because they miss me. Um

3121
03:59:45,060 --> 03:59:50,260
But they're very independent putters, but when when I open this door, they know that I'm not working anymore

3122
03:59:50,660 --> 03:59:56,980
You know, did you ever see that twitch clip where the guy has a dog and he's like, thank you so much everyone for liking and subscribing

3123
03:59:56,980 --> 04:00:01,940
But the dog recognized that that meant he's about to go off stream and it got all excited

3124
04:00:02,660 --> 04:00:08,500
Do you remember that clip? Basically, that's what Gimli and Vigo are like when I open the door, they know I'm not working anymore

3125
04:00:09,060 --> 04:00:11,060
So then they're all

3126
04:00:12,820 --> 04:00:13,700
Um

3127
04:00:13,700 --> 04:00:17,700
So Joe, but I'm in at this point. Just ink me dry correction

3128
04:00:18,180 --> 04:00:21,380
Bratty squid girl one of my cuttlefish

3129
04:00:22,420 --> 04:00:24,900
But yes, I'm a cephalopods. So that also looks okay

3130
04:00:27,940 --> 04:00:32,580
Go on. I like when I can hear you, but often you're very quiet. I am fucking

3131
04:00:33,380 --> 04:00:36,900
And then I get deafened by an explosion or a scream

3132
04:00:38,260 --> 04:00:40,740
And an audio or on live stream

3133
04:00:43,140 --> 04:00:47,300
Stony another smoothie clip just hit the tube. Oh, no

3134
04:00:48,900 --> 04:00:50,900
Oh, no, this can't be

3135
04:00:51,220 --> 04:00:53,220
Wonka earth

3136
04:00:54,180 --> 04:00:56,180
Hey

3137
04:00:56,580 --> 04:00:59,060
Oh for fuck's sake, it's a better body script

3138
04:01:02,580 --> 04:01:05,460
Oh my god, the thumbnail says monkey noises

3139
04:01:06,420 --> 04:01:08,420
Oh

3140
04:01:12,580 --> 04:01:14,580
I think I

3141
04:01:14,980 --> 04:01:16,980

3142
04:01:17,940 --> 04:01:23,140
Well, if you need something to do to keep you occupied between now and she be going live

3143
04:01:25,220 --> 04:01:27,220
There's monkey noises has been

3144
04:01:28,980 --> 04:01:30,980
Enough

3145
04:01:30,980 --> 04:01:34,580
I don't want to listen to it because I'll get copyright off of his thing, but

3146
04:01:35,540 --> 04:01:37,540
Oh my god

3147
04:01:38,980 --> 04:01:41,780
Oh my god, it's emmy

3148
04:01:42,660 --> 04:01:44,900
It's emmy and she be reading the script

3149
04:01:45,860 --> 04:01:49,460
That please put some puppies in me why not so hard

3150
04:01:50,020 --> 04:01:54,020
I fucking was so surprised. I even got the courage to come out with that

3151
04:01:54,260 --> 04:02:00,100
I was completely like non-verbal through that whole thing. Like normally sometimes like I'll say something

3152
04:02:00,260 --> 04:02:02,660
I'll be like, oh please or this or that or whatever

3153
04:02:03,620 --> 04:02:04,900
My ass

3154
04:02:04,900 --> 04:02:06,660
was like

3155
04:02:06,660 --> 04:02:08,660
Feeling it. Okay

3156
04:02:09,060 --> 04:02:11,060
That's

3157
04:02:11,380 --> 04:02:14,900
Another smoothie video has hit the tubes of the world. We're in solo solo

3158
04:02:18,500 --> 04:02:20,820
I'm so surprised I managed to even come out with that one

04:02:28,420 --> 04:02:34,260
Demon Slayer mit suri konoji cosplay

3163
04:02:51,140 --> 04:02:57,700

3164
04:02:57,940 --> 04:02:59,940

04:03:00,180 --> 04:03:01,300

3166
04:03:01,300 --> 04:03:02,900

So I'm gonna have to I will draw the makeup

3168
04:03:05,700 --> 04:03:10,180

3171
04:03:23,300 --> 04:03:24,900
Pause play stream

3172
04:03:24,900 --> 04:03:28,740
Wait, am I wait am I not allowed to do them because I'm a feature of her or am I allowed to do them?

3173
04:03:29,460 --> 04:03:31,460
Because I'm you know, I'm in my own mate

3174
04:03:33,060 --> 04:03:38,100
I really want to do Rebecca from cyberpunk ASMR and it would just be like neck down

3175
04:03:39,620 --> 04:03:42,900
And then everyone'd be like, oh look at your tummy and I built. Yeah, I got tummy

I got a soft little tummy and go pit-pit-pit-pit-pit and I'm gonna paint myself blue. Oh wait, should I paint myself blue?

3177
04:03:49,300 --> 04:03:53,060

04:04:02,100 --> 04:04:03,460
Thank you

3181
04:04:03,460 --> 04:04:05,460
Pre your post goomba stone. No

3182
04:04:07,780 --> 04:04:09,780
Your ass hasn't spoken

3183
04:04:10,020 --> 04:04:15,940
And how long and that's the first message you fucking give me is that Rebecca got goomba stone? You're done for wait

3184
04:04:16,020 --> 04:04:20,820
You're your tummy. Yeah, you know Rebecca. You know same Rebecca. Hold on. Let me get let me get a picture of her

3185
04:04:22,180 --> 04:04:24,180
uh, let me

3186
04:04:24,820 --> 04:04:27,060
Let me get a picture of Rebecca

3187
04:04:28,020 --> 04:04:30,020
any Rebecca's

3188
04:04:32,020 --> 04:04:34,020
Image

3189
04:04:34,580 --> 04:04:36,580
Same as

3190
04:04:38,660 --> 04:04:40,660
Why does it have a not so far?

3191
04:04:41,620 --> 04:04:45,540
She's in a bikini. Wait, that's not Rebecca. That's not her actual

3192
04:04:46,500 --> 04:04:48,500
Yeah, she's in a bikini

3193
04:04:50,020 --> 04:04:53,540
Why is it so hard to get a reference of a video game character?

3194
04:04:58,580 --> 04:05:01,300
That looks like AI because that's not even her design

3195
04:05:04,340 --> 04:05:08,260
Long story short, I'm in a bikini and a jacket for the stream. Okay

3196
04:05:09,220 --> 04:05:12,420
I'm in a bikini and a jacket for the stream. Is that acceptable?

3197
04:05:14,980 --> 04:05:18,580
Hold on. Let me grab this. Oh, no, it's a web. I'm it's a fake link

3198
04:05:20,260 --> 04:05:22,260
Fine. Fuck you. I'm screenshotting

3199
04:05:22,740 --> 04:05:27,300
That was me. That was my pc because I screenshotted it was having a hissy fit. I don't like when I screenshot

3200
04:05:31,460 --> 04:05:33,940
This is what I want to dress up as on stream

3201
04:05:33,940 --> 04:05:35,940
I

3202
04:05:36,260 --> 04:05:38,260
Like she has twin tails too

3203
04:05:42,340 --> 04:05:44,020
Sometime done

3204
04:05:44,020 --> 04:05:48,820
I want to dress up like this, but I'm not going to show my face. It's going to be neck down only. All right

3205
04:05:50,180 --> 04:05:53,620
You're going to do the body paint. So I've looked into her cosplay before

3206
04:05:54,100 --> 04:05:59,940
It comes with a stencil and you just stick it on your on you and then you wet it

3207
04:06:00,180 --> 04:06:02,180
So I'll still be able to do it

3208
04:06:02,820 --> 04:06:08,340
But yeah, so it's basically jacket and bikini and because rebecca doesn't have a big rack

3209
04:06:09,060 --> 04:06:13,700
Yeah, I kind of fit rebecca. You know what I'm saying? So it'd be pretty lower, aren't you?

3210
04:06:14,660 --> 04:06:16,900
Like a cadbury cream egg. You know what? Fuck you

3211
04:06:18,580 --> 04:06:19,780
Um

3212
04:06:19,780 --> 04:06:24,260
Yeah, I thought you meant the other girl with a bob cut. No fucking candy. I don't know

3213
04:06:24,580 --> 04:06:27,140
I don't know how anyone is going for lucy. Sorry

3214
04:06:27,860 --> 04:06:37,700
Lucy lucy from cyberpunk. You have the choice between rebecca or lucy and people are arguing over lucy

3215
04:06:38,580 --> 04:06:40,580
sorry

3216
04:06:41,540 --> 04:06:47,860
Sorry, but how is anyone genuinely arguing for lucy? Fuck it

3217
04:06:50,180 --> 04:06:56,260
I couldn't give less of a rat ass about lucy's design. It's shite. It's all right, but it's shite, you know

3218
04:06:56,660 --> 04:06:58,660
Rebecca calls. That's me

3219
04:06:59,700 --> 04:07:07,220
I think they're both okay. You don't think rebecca's a 10 out of 10. I love her though. She's just like me for real

3220
04:07:09,060 --> 04:07:12,020
She's literally perfection like this is me bouncing on her now

3221
04:07:18,420 --> 04:07:24,020
Lucy's the e-girl that literally ruined david's life. I like rebecca about her first journey. Oh, okay, that's

3222
04:07:24,820 --> 04:07:33,460
Actually canceled shipped and departed deeply departed. Uh, it's okay to be wrong reflying. Okay, it's okay to be wrong

3223
04:07:34,820 --> 04:07:36,820
You are more autism

3224
04:07:36,980 --> 04:07:38,980
Stroney

3225
04:07:38,980 --> 04:07:40,980
What was that in response to?

3226
04:07:42,100 --> 04:07:45,540
Lucy had a couple of good moments. I'll give her credit where it's due the stretcher scene

3227
04:07:46,180 --> 04:07:48,180
Eh, but rebecca goes hard

3228
04:07:49,140 --> 04:07:51,140
Glad the studio forgot to keep her

3229
04:07:52,100 --> 04:07:54,100
They should have killed lucy not rebecca

3230
04:07:56,580 --> 04:07:58,580
Real untrue

3231
04:07:59,380 --> 04:08:01,380
Um

3232
04:08:02,740 --> 04:08:08,820
I didn't see the anime but from aesthetic wise the crazy eyes on lucy hit different. Yeah. Um, so as I said, I wouldn't do

3233
04:08:09,460 --> 04:08:11,460
I won't show my face

3234
04:08:11,540 --> 04:08:14,020
I'll do like neck down ASMR stream

3235
04:08:14,900 --> 04:08:18,420
And I'll wear the wig and everything. I mean, sorry my real blue hair

3236
04:08:19,380 --> 04:08:21,380
My real blue rebecca here

3237
04:08:21,940 --> 04:08:23,220
and

3238
04:08:23,220 --> 04:08:25,380
She just had to sit to sit. She did

3239
04:08:26,020 --> 04:08:27,380
rebecca

3240
04:08:27,380 --> 04:08:31,620
Stroney, please be the e-girl that ruins my life pop up up get main broken

3241
04:08:32,260 --> 04:08:37,140
You can never ink to someone else again. I will never feel like good. It only feels good with when it's me

3242
04:08:38,500 --> 04:08:40,820
That's terrible. I shouldn't do that about the same time

3243
04:08:41,380 --> 04:08:43,380
kind of hot though

3244
04:08:43,860 --> 04:08:49,060
Blue wake over your real watermelon colored hair exactly my real green and

3245
04:08:53,940 --> 04:08:58,500
Here's the reason rebecca is flat girl confirmed. I accept your offer stroney

3246
04:08:59,700 --> 04:09:04,660
Is it gonna be for patreon member? No, just just a regular smagular stream. I like rebecca

3247
04:09:05,860 --> 04:09:07,860
I wouldn't pay all that

3248
04:09:08,820 --> 04:09:10,820
I was dressing up and painting myself

3249
04:09:10,980 --> 04:09:12,820
Blue

3250
04:09:13,300 --> 04:09:17,940
I might have to wear a body suit actually now that I think about it. There's no way I can stream with paint on me

3251
04:09:19,860 --> 04:09:21,860
Can you get paint that sets on the skin?

3252
04:09:22,980 --> 04:09:28,260
If you can get paint that can set on the skin, I will paint the fuck out of myself

3253
04:09:29,940 --> 04:09:31,780
Got it only ink to you

3254
04:09:31,780 --> 04:09:34,740
Stroney really are the perfect woman. What because I'm weak enough

3255
04:09:36,100 --> 04:09:38,340
Give us the adam smasher treatment

3256
04:09:38,420 --> 04:09:40,420
Oh

3257
04:09:40,420 --> 04:09:41,860
Oh my god

3258
04:09:41,860 --> 04:09:49,540
The same day I do the rebecca stream. I will do an alternative audio as well. Yeah, body paint this body paint

3259
04:09:51,460 --> 04:09:54,500
Does body paint stay on

3260
04:09:56,980 --> 04:10:00,180
That sounds so dumb unlike body paint is temporary

3261
04:10:00,340 --> 04:10:05,780
But like does it stay on so i'm not gonna get my 3d or covered in blue paint? That's what i'm trying to ask

3262
04:10:06,020 --> 04:10:08,020
I mean you guys might know better than me

3263
04:10:09,300 --> 04:10:13,460
Uh body suit would be easier to go with. Yes, it's on server. It's a lifestyle choice

3264
04:10:14,340 --> 04:10:18,180
We've we flings one. I hope so. I hope you always win with me

3265
04:10:20,100 --> 04:10:23,460
Rebecca's ass is like 10% of what you have on me. How can you call me?

3266
04:10:24,420 --> 04:10:26,420
Rebecca's the best

3267
04:10:26,420 --> 04:10:28,420
Wait, hold on. Rebecca

3268
04:10:33,460 --> 04:10:35,460
Rebecca voicelines

3269
04:10:36,420 --> 04:10:40,900
She's cyberpunk. I don't know if I can mimic her voice. I doubt it, but

3270
04:10:50,660 --> 04:10:52,660
I'm so clumsy. Sorry

3271
04:10:56,420 --> 04:11:04,740
Sorry about that handsome. It's no problem sweetheart make it up to you next time k make it up to you next time k

04:11:09,700 --> 04:11:11,940
Bumbo voicing that was good

3274
04:11:17,940 --> 04:11:22,580
Sensitive, you know, why are you yelling at me? I'm sensitive, you know

3275
04:11:24,420 --> 04:11:26,580

I'm Rebecca. I'm Rebecca joining up with main's crew. I hear you're joining up with main's crew

3277
04:11:33,700 --> 04:11:35,300

We've seen you around man. We've seen you around us. Buh-bye. David my man. What's going on?

3279
04:11:41,140 --> 04:11:47,780

3280
04:11:48,740 --> 04:11:52,900
I can only artificially fit the rasp. Well, I'm not gonna gonna. Yeah, you'll like that. Yeah

3281
04:11:53,460 --> 04:11:55,460
Rip Vod. No, no, no, this isn't copyright

3282
04:11:55,860 --> 04:12:01,540
It's cause it's mashed together scenes and I'm talking over it if it does get copyright you get another free audio

3283
04:12:02,500 --> 04:12:04,500
That's how we're doing it right

3284
04:12:05,140 --> 04:12:07,140
Um

3285
04:12:07,620 --> 04:12:13,860
Hi strongy. Thank you for the stream today. Yeah, but you're welcome. Thank you for also being such a good cuddle pop

3286
04:12:13,940 --> 04:12:17,540
Oh, that's such a cute combination. I think strongy likes you or dare

3287
04:12:18,820 --> 04:12:21,380
Oh, that's how i'm gonna get a natural rest or dare

3288
04:12:22,740 --> 04:12:24,260
There you go

3289
04:12:24,260 --> 04:12:26,580
Uh, what will you do today call his big daddy?

3290
04:12:26,580 --> 04:12:28,580
Oh

3291
04:12:29,380 --> 04:12:31,380
Since you're ovulating today, maybe

3292
04:12:33,700 --> 04:12:35,700
I can't read the rest of that

3293
04:12:36,420 --> 04:12:42,420
The vocal for a wild card the only vocal fry we accept around these parts is a wild card

3294
04:12:43,380 --> 04:12:45,380
Okay

3295
04:12:51,700 --> 04:12:57,940
Talking about Becca, I'm excited for the jada figure that is gonna be around jada. Who's jada?

3296
04:12:58,660 --> 04:13:02,900
Hold on. I'm like literally researching jada figure

3297
04:13:02,900 --> 04:13:04,900
What's jada?

3298
04:13:08,580 --> 04:13:10,580
Hmm

3299
04:13:10,740 --> 04:13:12,340
Oh dear

3300
04:13:12,340 --> 04:13:15,460
Marshmallows. Yeah, I'm looking at marshmallows. I'm not allowed to look at marshmallows

3301
04:13:17,700 --> 04:13:24,100
Check out Tatsumaki from One Punch. Oh, I think I watched One Punch like season one

3302
04:13:25,060 --> 04:13:27,060
I'm not even gonna watch it again

3303
04:13:27,700 --> 04:13:29,540
Got green hair

3304
04:13:29,540 --> 04:13:34,580
Ash got no titties. That's what i'm talking about. Yeah, give me more anime girls with no titties fad ourselves

3305
04:13:34,740 --> 04:13:36,740
I'll cosplay the fuck out of them

3306
04:13:36,900 --> 04:13:41,620
I'm glad to revisit raptor again with you. You did a wonderful job. Oh, thank you

3307
04:13:42,100 --> 04:13:45,940
I think I did so much better this play through like so so much better than yesterday

3308
04:13:46,020 --> 04:13:49,140
It only took a whole slate to to educate myself

3309
04:13:50,980 --> 04:13:54,660
Who's the sassy lost champ? Oh, mommy is Tatsumaki

3310
04:13:59,700 --> 04:14:01,700
Is Johnny Cosplay win?

3311
04:14:09,380 --> 04:14:11,380
Depends

3312
04:14:12,740 --> 04:14:14,740
You need to let me give me some more time

3313
04:14:15,460 --> 04:14:17,460
Give me some more time because

3314
04:14:17,860 --> 04:14:23,700
There's a few things happening behind the scenes right now. And I think uh, you might like the result of them

3315
04:14:24,820 --> 04:14:26,980
And feel support of a mummy cosplay. Yeah

3316
04:14:30,500 --> 04:14:33,700
Now again the problem with my current outfit is I have my tits so

3317
04:14:34,500 --> 04:14:36,500
Okay, uh, there you go. Um

3318
04:14:37,220 --> 04:14:43,780
Johnny cosplay the veal or girl now. I'm gonna tell you something that I have backed out of but if you guys want it

3319
04:14:43,780 --> 04:14:45,780
I'll let you have it. Okay

3320
04:14:46,180 --> 04:14:48,740
I originally was gonna

3321
04:14:49,860 --> 04:14:57,700
Now in quotation marks bikini cosplay as my gen mates and I was gonna doodle like their hair on top of me in the pictures

3322
04:14:57,700 --> 04:15:00,820
And obviously like, you know, wouldn't show my face or anything like that

3323
04:15:01,540 --> 04:15:03,300
um

3324
04:15:03,300 --> 04:15:10,820
So I was gonna like, you know get like an orange like micro bikini for me and then ac would be like tooth floss

3325
04:15:11,460 --> 04:15:14,660
Um, you know she be would kind of be a bit more. Yeah

3326
04:15:15,860 --> 04:15:21,300
I was gonna do that for a donut on reward, but then I backed out of it because I wasn't sure

3327
04:15:22,900 --> 04:15:25,300
I don't know we'll discuss it this week

3328
04:15:25,300 --> 04:15:31,060
There's a lot of things to discuss if you're a member. I do have a membership stream discussing my personal donut on stuff

3329
04:15:31,780 --> 04:15:38,500
Because there was a lot of things where I was like like a bikini cosplay. Yeah, like so far as zero for example, it would be purple

3330
04:15:39,700 --> 04:15:46,660
But like I would get one of those like see through veal wrap things to go along with me and then like I see for example

3331
04:15:46,740 --> 04:15:48,740
I would buy

3332
04:15:48,740 --> 04:15:51,220
Pause so I have bear paws like her

3333
04:15:51,940 --> 04:15:56,980
Um, and like big winter boots type thing and tooth floss bikini. Basically

3334
04:15:57,860 --> 04:15:59,860
sounds epic to me

3335
04:16:00,180 --> 04:16:02,180
um

3336
04:16:02,660 --> 04:16:07,140
Yeah, and like emmy would be like orange bikini and then like I put a womb tattoo on that

3337
04:16:07,380 --> 04:16:09,460
Like says I love my big brother or something like that

3338
04:16:09,460 --> 04:16:12,980
But I didn't want it to be too weird because obviously I need to ask the girls if they're comfortable with that

3339
04:16:13,620 --> 04:16:19,620
Bikini cause really more like yes, please and basically I would draw their hair on top of me because obviously I can't even buy wigs for

3340
04:16:20,340 --> 04:16:23,700
All of them. It's just for one and done. I'd rather you know, not

3341
04:16:24,340 --> 04:16:27,300
Amy's whole body is like smaller than your cake size

3342
04:16:27,940 --> 04:16:32,260
Back from the shower what we talking about wise second best girl on stream

3343
04:16:33,140 --> 04:16:36,020
uh, because I want to cosplay rebecca later date and

3344
04:16:37,220 --> 04:16:40,500
I've already looked over the script for the membership stream and spoiler at mommy talks about

3345
04:16:40,980 --> 04:16:42,100
I am

3346
04:16:42,100 --> 04:16:48,020
Um, this is a live stream. I'm not pre-recording these streams. They're gonna start freaking believe you the ink will flow

3347
04:16:48,500 --> 04:16:52,020
We want bikini you ask him many

3348
04:16:53,620 --> 04:16:55,380
um

3349
04:16:55,380 --> 04:16:57,380
But yeah, because like I have that

3350
04:16:57,940 --> 04:17:05,700
I was also gonna do so. I don't know if you heard about a mole flavor working with a iron mouse and

3351
04:17:06,820 --> 04:17:08,180
project melody

3352
04:17:08,180 --> 04:17:14,100
I was gonna do like a reward for that as well, but I don't we'll discuss it. It's not pre-recorded stop it

3353
04:17:14,100 --> 04:17:16,100
But put it on your eyelashes, right?

3354
04:17:16,500 --> 04:17:18,500
Um

3355
04:17:19,620 --> 04:17:24,660
So this is have you ever inked to a marshmallow before? Yes, I have. I kind of do it regularly

3356
04:17:25,300 --> 04:17:26,420
um

3357
04:17:26,420 --> 04:17:28,180
on ironically

3358
04:17:28,180 --> 04:17:32,820
Don't know if that's weird. I don't know if it's weird or not, but I do thoroughly enjoy what I get

3359
04:17:33,700 --> 04:17:41,380
Um, she who controls the ink controls the universe. We should watch dune. Oh, no, they never completed it dune too was supposed to be

3360
04:17:42,180 --> 04:17:45,540
Uh, sorry add the sneezes and then I pick up

3361
04:17:47,860 --> 04:17:50,260
And take your meds starting

3362
04:17:55,380 --> 04:17:58,820
Well, mate, can you please do an audio sometime where you teach us how to make noise?

3363
04:17:58,980 --> 04:18:03,220
I've been taught to be a ninja. Oh, you got ninja pro from black ops one

3364
04:18:03,940 --> 04:18:05,940
Uh, how'd that take? Oh

3365
04:18:06,580 --> 04:18:08,580
Oh my god, I should

3366
04:18:08,980 --> 04:18:14,980
Oh my god, I should do a joy, but you have to like

3367
04:18:16,900 --> 04:18:20,900
Do it with me and I'll teach you how to do it, you know

3368
04:18:24,260 --> 04:18:25,460
Oh

3369
04:18:25,460 --> 04:18:27,460
Oh, now you're giving me some real ideas

3370
04:18:28,180 --> 04:18:34,020
As I said, the third editor is now in place so I can start doing stuff that I want to do. You don't want to sing me

3371
04:18:34,500 --> 04:18:36,500
Um

3372
04:18:36,820 --> 04:18:38,820
Years are turning

3373
04:18:38,980 --> 04:18:41,780
Say no more you have me hook line and sinker

3374
04:18:43,060 --> 04:18:44,260
Um

3375
04:18:44,260 --> 04:18:48,500
Hi, story. Thank you for playing one of my favorite games. Oh, congrats. I played your childhood game

3376
04:18:48,740 --> 04:18:53,700
It really makes me happy seeing you enjoy the game. I hope you like infinite. It's my favorite game of all time

3377
04:18:53,860 --> 04:18:56,260
Oh, a lot of pressure on internet then

3378
04:18:56,900 --> 04:19:01,620
Uh, no, I really enjoyed that. I do apologize for me being in a little shite bag yesterday

3379
04:19:01,700 --> 04:19:07,220
But I'm much more confident today. Oh, is ninja a bad thing? No, no, no being the ninja is not a bad thing at all

3380
04:19:07,300 --> 04:19:09,620
But if you want to, you know, send me a marshmallow

3381
04:19:11,380 --> 04:19:13,380
If you're dead silent

3382
04:19:15,060 --> 04:19:16,340
You know

3383
04:19:16,340 --> 04:19:21,220
You know, I ask me who says that when my literally my all audios are

3384
04:19:22,740 --> 04:19:24,740
And then that's it. That's it. That's the end of the audio

3385
04:19:24,740 --> 04:19:26,740
Um

3386
04:19:27,620 --> 04:19:31,220
Stronio nasan. Oh, please. I love the big sister is

3387
04:19:32,580 --> 04:19:40,180
Dynamic, I don't care. I don't care cancel me. Uh, you can cancel me. It's okay. Um

3388
04:19:46,900 --> 04:19:48,900
It's right now

3389
04:19:49,940 --> 04:19:54,100
Right now my ink is pretty clear because of all the inking

3390
04:19:54,740 --> 04:19:58,180
I couldn't concide you and I don't think I had to worry about getting you pregnant

3391
04:19:59,300 --> 04:20:03,540
This stuff needs time to regenerate. Oh my god. Wait, how many times are you doing that? I do

3392
04:20:04,980 --> 04:20:09,060
Well, exactly as a marshmallow. It is the q&a that you see in the link below

3393
04:20:10,420 --> 04:20:13,300
And you can send me anonymous questions and that's how I read it

3394
04:20:14,580 --> 04:20:20,420
Like that's why I know you guys so like our marshmallows just videos are like an audio. Is there anything we can be tech?

3395
04:20:20,500 --> 04:20:25,140
You can ask me a question. You can send me an audio. You can send me a video. You can show me a picture

3396
04:20:26,340 --> 04:20:31,460
You can ask questions. You can give me feedback on stuff that you didn't like stuff that you did like

3397
04:20:32,980 --> 04:20:37,300
The day you cosplay as yourself, I will be completely dry

3398
04:20:39,060 --> 04:20:40,660
and

3399
04:20:40,660 --> 04:20:46,020
Will there ever be a day we can get the inside scoop? Um, considering what's about to happen

3400
04:20:46,980 --> 04:20:48,980
in a couple of months time

3401
04:20:49,940 --> 04:20:51,860
Not yet

3402
04:20:51,860 --> 04:20:55,300
I should send an audio and paint up of it strongy strong and all

3403
04:20:56,020 --> 04:20:58,020
It's more like strongy stroke me off

3404
04:21:02,740 --> 04:21:04,740
Thank you. Thank you. I'll be here all week

3405
04:21:09,540 --> 04:21:12,340
You'll eat that one like three two days and

3406
04:21:12,660 --> 04:21:14,660
Okay

3407
04:21:14,660 --> 04:21:18,420
Mommy if you do a bikini stream, I don't know I'll survive. No, not bikini stream

3408
04:21:20,020 --> 04:21:25,140
Rebecca technically may be bikini, but you know, I'll be wearing the big jacket that she comes with

3409
04:21:27,380 --> 04:21:29,380
Inside scoop on what?

3410
04:21:30,260 --> 04:21:32,260
Marshmallow that can't be the rest of it all

3411
04:21:39,540 --> 04:21:42,100
Continuous knee slappers. Yeah, you like that

3412
04:21:43,300 --> 04:21:48,420
Hi strongy, you should cosplay as my braids are waiting pop up up up. Are you gonna?

3413
04:21:49,060 --> 04:21:51,780
Are you gonna consummate our marriage tonight?

3414
04:21:53,780 --> 04:21:59,780
Are you gonna consummate me? Go on then show me what a husband can do

3415
04:22:06,500 --> 04:22:09,620
Strongly others who the fuck is calling me others I ain't got no kitty

3416
04:22:09,860 --> 04:22:16,020
Hi strongy, I tried to censor as much as I can so you can read this on stream

3417
04:22:16,980 --> 04:22:19,300
My cuddle pup wife is in heat. Well, then

3418
04:22:20,580 --> 04:22:22,580
There's no way I can read this

3419
04:22:22,900 --> 04:22:25,220
I want to lead you by your leash to the

3420
04:22:25,860 --> 04:22:28,740
Backyard and get you shy and nervous that we might get caught

3421
04:22:30,100 --> 04:22:34,100
To start I meant my beloved from no, I can't read I can't read that

3422
04:22:34,100 --> 04:22:36,100
That's too much that's too much

3423
04:22:37,620 --> 04:22:43,540
That's too much we will make our neighbors hear everything our honeymoon phase is gonna go wild

3424
04:22:45,540 --> 04:22:47,540
And

3425
04:22:48,340 --> 04:22:50,340
I can't read this

3426
04:22:51,780 --> 04:22:53,140
Right

3427
04:22:53,140 --> 04:22:59,220
I've stalled enough. I think I think she birds is going live and half an hour

3428
04:23:00,340 --> 04:23:02,340
So you're all getting forced to

3429
04:23:02,820 --> 04:23:04,580
Do it

3430
04:23:04,580 --> 04:23:07,080
Wild card now. I'm curious

3431
04:23:10,260 --> 04:23:12,260
Should I

3432
04:23:13,620 --> 04:23:16,260
Have no idea how many variants she has at this point

3433
04:23:18,340 --> 04:23:21,700
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna go rest. Oh, it's been such a

3434
04:23:22,420 --> 04:23:28,660
An endurance stream a whole four hours. Oh that really took the window of my sails. I'm so tired

3435
04:23:29,460 --> 04:23:31,460
Okay

3436
04:23:33,060 --> 04:23:39,140
The teaser is now getting shy. Well, if you guys if you didn't keep calling me puppy every two seconds, then I wouldn't

3437
04:23:41,860 --> 04:23:48,420
Opinions on human sacrifice. Uh, no, not necessary. It won't really work either does it?

3438
04:23:50,500 --> 04:23:52,340
Yeah

3439
04:23:52,340 --> 04:23:56,340
Wait, someone's gonna make a sheep spreadsheet. I don't know

3440
04:23:57,220 --> 04:23:58,820
No, mommy. I miss you already. I mean

3441
04:24:00,100 --> 04:24:02,100
Puppy stop it

Thanks for the stream. We'll be getting good rest. Yes, I'm gonna rest and then I'll make something

3444
04:24:14,100 --> 04:24:15,940
Um

3445
04:24:15,940 --> 04:24:18,740
Stop acting like it. We'll stop calling you

3446
04:24:20,580 --> 04:24:22,180
Stop

3447
04:24:22,180 --> 04:24:26,660
Okay, I'm gonna go and chill out and then I'll see you shortly

3448
04:24:27,940 --> 04:24:29,940
