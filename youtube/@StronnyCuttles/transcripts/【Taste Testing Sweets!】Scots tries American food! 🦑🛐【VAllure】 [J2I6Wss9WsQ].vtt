WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.520
I got the echo effect on, be honest right now. I like to sound like I got the echo effect on.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.480
Oh my god, oh that was supposed to be a censor.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.640
All right hold on, I'll down, I'll down, I'll down. I need to get my live chat.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.760
Oh I haven't even got freaking stream elements up in case someone do knows. Hold on, start

00:23.760 --> 00:36.000
that. I'm sorry, I apologize to anyone who does not like real body parts or immersion

00:36.000 --> 00:42.720
bros as you all know. Oh I can hear myself. Oh get that, close that stream right now.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.840
Hold on, hold on, let me cook, let me cook, let me cook. I'll get you up to date, I just need to.

00:48.800 --> 00:57.360
I'm so upset, I'm not. Just to see, just so you know, I couldn't get to your freaking thing to work

00:57.360 --> 01:04.720
so I had to draw it on a piece of paper. So it's literally on a piece of paper. This says,

01:06.560 --> 01:13.600
oh my god, I get it now. And then this one says, I got lotion on my tinnacle, I got lotion on my,

01:14.160 --> 01:20.800
mm-hmm. And then this one is just neutral B tier, it's a guy going, I mean, it's all right.

01:20.800 --> 01:27.440
And then this one is, it's the biggest piece of ever. And then this one says cast it into

01:27.440 --> 01:39.360
Mount Doom. And this freaking webcam doesn't, oh focus, what I told it to. So yeah, it's been,

01:39.360 --> 01:43.680
it's been a bit of a nightmare to get here but Ken, what we're here now. So let me, let me just

01:43.680 --> 01:50.400
check. Okay, I can officially see tips. So if you would like to tip, I will see it. And I can

01:50.400 --> 01:55.440
actually read it out. Oh my freaking mouth, there's an calibrated hold on, let me, let me enolize.

01:59.040 --> 02:06.080
Okay, much better calibration. Okay, the Gura sensor, true. It's big fish, look,

02:06.160 --> 02:11.200
so I got Gura. And then, and then look who I got, look who I got, you ready for this?

02:12.640 --> 02:22.400
Who's this? It's Pyro Pops. It's Cinder's plushie of Pyro Pops. And look, it, you came in a little

02:22.400 --> 02:31.520
color. Look, look at that little adorable little Pyro Pops. And look, it's even got the hurt ears

02:31.520 --> 02:37.920
and everything in the design. And then this one, are you ready? Let me reach, big reach,

02:37.920 --> 02:48.320
big heel reach. Look, it's strawberry, darling straw. You know, darling straw, this is her mascot.

02:52.480 --> 02:59.040
Got a little bowl, and got a little butt. Sorry, a bunch of the webcam's rubbish,

02:59.040 --> 03:04.720
but it's probably, oh, it's glitching. But yeah, look, I got Pyro Pops and a straw,

03:05.600 --> 03:10.880
plushie, and I got Gura, and I got a few other things on the way, but they're not here yet,

03:10.880 --> 03:15.360
it's totally not over market. Check out the link in the description for the merch down below.

03:16.800 --> 03:24.480
Your nails are so shiny, right? Right, right, before we get into the actual taste testing,

03:25.440 --> 03:33.280
do you know how they freaking destroyed my toe? So if you didn't know, when you get a manicure

03:33.280 --> 03:39.360
and a pedicure, you have to get cut around here. They like cut all your skin away here, right?

03:40.240 --> 03:47.360
They cut into me, and this one doesn't have like all this on it. So I just, yeah, I got manicure

03:47.360 --> 03:51.600
and a pedicure. I'm not beating the sweaty feet allegations because I don't know if you can hear

03:51.600 --> 03:59.760
this, but yeah, like the paper's lifting with my feet. But yeah, I got manicure and a pedicure

04:01.840 --> 04:07.600
for the monetization stream. However, it's not going to stop me. I mean, look at,

04:09.520 --> 04:15.040
I'm a real girl now, huh? I'm so feminine. I'm so feminine. You're going to be eating

04:15.040 --> 04:19.760
with your feet on the table. You sure you want to stick your feet on it? What are you talking about?

04:19.760 --> 04:28.240
Okay, let's, let's get into the first thing. We are going to be trying there.

04:31.120 --> 04:37.040
Okay. So basically, I have to manually freaking draw what tear I'm putting I am in as well. Like,

04:37.040 --> 04:45.280
it's just, it is what it is. So we're going to try a little Nerdy's. Anyone else? I don't find

04:45.280 --> 04:53.200
it nerd. It says pill tab here. I'm pulling and I'm ripping the box apart. It's not looking good.

04:53.200 --> 04:58.720
It says one and two on the side. Oh no, it's a logic puzzle we're feeling. It literally says,

04:59.520 --> 05:08.480
where's the webcam? Oh, focus on this is terrible. It says, okay, we can't even, it's a puzzle.

05:08.480 --> 05:14.160
Okay, there we go. We're in. We're in. Yep, this is how you're supposed to do it. Oh,

05:14.240 --> 05:18.960
there's two different colors. Oops. Wait, what's, okay, hold on. Let's just take

05:18.960 --> 05:26.240
our part. You know, oh my God. Okay, okay. Okay, there's two little sections. We have two

05:26.240 --> 05:30.960
clores. Choose your clore, any clore. Okay, we're gonna, we're gonna have pink.

05:35.760 --> 05:40.320
Oh, oh, that's sweet. It's purple, the same flavor.

05:44.240 --> 05:49.040
Oh, that's so sweet. It's almost sour. Oh, is this supposed to be sour?

05:49.920 --> 06:03.520
Grape and strawberry. Okay. Um, oh, uh, grape is not for me at all. I will allow, I will allow,

06:03.520 --> 06:11.360
um, uh, I'm gonna put it in a, I mean, it's all right. Hold on, we're like manually,

06:11.680 --> 06:16.560
I don't know. Now everyone knows I can't draw straight balls. Okay, what do nerds look like?

06:21.440 --> 06:26.320
I mean, it's all right. And then the packaging is pink and purple, but I don't have a pink and

06:26.320 --> 06:32.480
purple pencil. Yeah, the grape flavor is very diverse. Yeah, strawberry is my preferred over

06:32.480 --> 06:39.520
grape. Yeah, I'm definitely strawberry gang, straw, straw. Draw the little guys. Oh, they have like

06:39.520 --> 06:49.040
a schnozer. Okay, hold on. And then they're butt and then their feet. And then their eyeballs.

06:50.080 --> 06:56.400
And then their little happy face. What do we think? What do we think of my nerds?

06:56.720 --> 07:10.400
That wasn't too bad. I love it. Oh, you want to see, you want to see the, oh, right. Okay, hold on.

07:10.400 --> 07:15.680
There's like so much I wanted to show in this stream, like so, so much. I was originally gonna wear

07:15.680 --> 07:22.240
this outfit for you guys, but then I was like, oh, I can't because YouTube is reviewing my channel.

07:22.960 --> 07:29.120
But I got, so if you didn't know, the white on my outfit is pearlescent, like it's rainbow-esque.

07:29.120 --> 07:34.240
Okay, it's pearlescent. So I got that. And then this is like, this is what the white on my costume

07:34.240 --> 07:40.240
is. It's pearlescent. I don't even see it that well. I don't wear it. Be careful, American

07:40.240 --> 07:45.840
sweets are super sugary. I'm not gonna eat like, eat, eat everything. But you know what I'm gonna

07:45.840 --> 07:57.920
wash it down with? A fucking can of, oh no. Little, little ASMR moment. This is what,

08:00.240 --> 08:03.840
I'm sorry if you don't like hand sticks. I'm afraid I have hand sticks.

08:06.880 --> 08:12.320
With all my might as I shake car battery juice, the national drink of Scotland, Scotland is the

08:12.320 --> 08:22.160
only country in the whole wide world, the whole wide world that has number one sales, not cola.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.440
So cheers, come pie.

08:31.600 --> 08:36.960
Insert bagpipe noises here. That's so good. I've not had that in ages. Right, let me put it down.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.880
The reason why we're sipping into the iron brewers, I put it on the table over there because I'm

08:41.600 --> 08:50.800
gonna knock it off. We have two drinks to try from America. Oh, if you have a can on your desk,

08:50.800 --> 08:58.080
that's 355 milliliters, also known as 12 fluid ounces. This is what my hand looks like holding it.

08:59.120 --> 09:04.480
My fingies don't even get like up there. I'm getting a lot of condensation though.

09:05.440 --> 09:14.720
We're gonna try cream, soda, A and W as the condensation. Okay, ready. We're gonna try the

09:14.720 --> 09:21.840
drinks first. Oh my, oh such a girl. This is not hand sweat before anyone starts making fun.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.320
Okay, you guys, come pie.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.640
Yes, that is a drink. Okay.

09:40.160 --> 09:46.640
It's not, I mean, it's not right. It's not that, it's actually not that bad. I wouldn't reach for it.

09:46.640 --> 09:51.440
Oh, I missed tips. I'm so sorry. I'm such a bad streamer. Thank you, tiny spiny for the tip,

09:51.440 --> 09:55.120
just as a promise. I have some iron brew with me and I just had some. No idea how to describe

09:55.120 --> 09:59.520
the taste, but it tastes better than it smells. Might have to get more of this going forward.

09:59.520 --> 10:04.800
Yay, thank you for the tip. Zion, thank you for the tip. When you have to be a good Christian

10:04.800 --> 10:08.880
man on Sunday but cuddles the stream and you do what you have to do and chin in with some one

10:08.880 --> 10:15.120
earbud while Mass is going, when can the reeflings taste the Scottish sweets? Honestly, thank you

10:15.120 --> 10:20.800
for the tip. I can't believe you're in church right now. Take me to church right now. I'm putting

10:20.800 --> 10:26.000
all the drinks up on this little shelf because there's a 100% chance I'm going to knock over.

10:27.680 --> 10:32.240
Honestly, that wasn't that bad but I wouldn't go out my way to have it. I feel like everything's

10:32.240 --> 10:36.960
going to end up being neutral. Right, what was that? That was A and W and it's like on its side

10:36.960 --> 10:46.240
like this. A and W, like that. And then it's got like a little logo. It's like two circles.

10:47.040 --> 10:57.600
I mean, it's alright. Okay, now we're trying American Dr Pepper. 150 calories per serving.

10:57.600 --> 11:02.640
So not for the full can. Oh no, the serving size is a can. Some things do that where the

11:02.640 --> 11:13.360
serving size is a lie. It's a false profit. Okay. Get the aroma, that's right. Get the aroma in

11:13.360 --> 11:30.000
your palate. Yes, yes, have it. Okay. Uh-huh. Oh, oh, it's going to be, you guys drink that stuff?

11:30.880 --> 11:34.640
What is that flavor? I don't even know what the flavor is. There's something wrong with it anyway.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.560
Oh, I should see my head bobbing up and down. Oh, that's my head there. See that? That's that's

11:40.960 --> 11:45.440
the headset, Mike, but I'm going to talk to you through that, Mike. That's moody.

11:46.560 --> 11:56.560
Dr Pepper Gaming, 23 flavors. Is that why there's 20? Oh my goodness. Right. I'm sorry to my Dr

11:58.080 --> 12:04.640
Pepper fans. It's not cast it into the fires of Mint Doom. I'm more or I guess it's technically

12:04.640 --> 12:14.720
correct. What does the front look like? A Dr Pepper. And then what's got 23 flavors? Oh my

12:14.720 --> 12:24.080
god, 23. She's not the one she's talked to Pepper. Yeah, that, my brain was like nothing.

12:25.360 --> 12:32.640
Right. Y'all want a kiss? Oh, sugar. I never thought this far ahead.

12:34.960 --> 12:41.680
Oh god, I never thought this far ahead. No, the packaging. I'm getting trolled. The

12:41.680 --> 12:48.160
fucking thing came open. It's not open. I'm getting trolled. Hold on. I never brought a knife. I never

12:48.160 --> 12:57.120
thought to broaden what? No, your troll. Oh, there we go. Oh my god. These are like those kisses.

12:57.120 --> 13:04.080
I remember there were so many memes online that are like, oh, you should, you should what?

13:04.160 --> 13:09.280
It was like, oh, ask your crush if she wants a kiss. And if she says no and rejects you,

13:09.280 --> 13:14.160
just pull out a Hershey's kiss from your pocket. And then all the comments were like, oh, what?

13:15.680 --> 13:19.840
Is this a, is there a joke on the back? No, there's not. Okay, there's not a joke on the back.

13:19.840 --> 13:30.960
It's not fortune cookie. Okay, gobble, gobble. Oh, it's hard. Wait, is it hard? Oh no, I had it

13:30.960 --> 13:43.360
in the fridge. That's why it's hard. Why is it? I do have a napkin to remove food from my mouth

13:43.360 --> 13:47.280
that I no longer wish to have in my mouth. So I do apologize if people don't like that.

13:48.080 --> 13:54.960
It melts in your mouth. The cocoa percentage is a bit better.

13:55.600 --> 14:09.200
I think I can swallow it. Oh, that's better. Oh, I'm fine. I'm chewing through it.

14:10.480 --> 14:22.880
It stuck to my teeth. Okay, okay. Oh, I would not have a second one. I'm so sorry. I wouldn't.

14:23.520 --> 14:31.120
All right, we'll see how it ambidextrous. All right, let me just draw in the second box. Hold on.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.920
Easy, easy, easy.

14:41.040 --> 14:43.600
By the way, I got manicure and pedicure. Did you see?

14:47.200 --> 14:51.680
Oh, I also know the Vietnamese strats. So Boss Lady was the one,

14:52.400 --> 14:58.000
there was two ladies working on me at once. What was that? A kisses. So there was two ladies working

14:58.000 --> 15:10.400
on me at once and it turns out it was the boss and she was telling me about her visa and she was

15:10.400 --> 15:18.400
like, oh, I had two children so they can't kick me out and I was like, you're smart. And she was

15:18.480 --> 15:22.080
like, yeah, if they want to kick me out, they have to take me to family court. And I was like,

15:22.080 --> 15:26.880
she's telling me the Vietnamese strats. I'm like, you're an actual five head for that. So we're

15:26.880 --> 15:32.560
having to be giggle about that. So I definitely recommend what they call, I think they're called

15:32.560 --> 15:38.400
chop shop nail bars when it's just like a bunch of girls and all that. So there was two women working

15:38.400 --> 15:46.480
on me and the women that was kindly working on my feet, she didn't speak any English, which is fine.

15:46.480 --> 15:50.080
So we never spoke or anything, but I spoke a little bit to the owner because she was doing

15:51.040 --> 15:59.120
the manicure. And basically, so I paid and then I went away and I got some cash out so I could

15:59.120 --> 16:05.120
give them a tip. And I gave the one that didn't speak English a tip and she was like, thank you,

16:05.120 --> 16:09.840
thank you. And I'm like, yeah, you worked hard. I couldn't really use a lot of words because I

16:09.840 --> 16:15.920
knew she didn't understand what they meant. But she was so lovely. Honestly, they worked so hard

16:15.920 --> 16:20.800
in these like nail bars. And then I gave the owner a tip as well. And because I was like, just thank

16:20.800 --> 16:26.000
you for being so nice because I walked in and I was like, I need French tip manicure, pedicure. I

16:26.000 --> 16:29.040
had don't know what it is because she was like, do you want gel? Do you want this? And I'm like,

16:29.040 --> 16:34.720
I don't know what any of this means. And she was like, it's okay, I look after you and her amazing

16:34.720 --> 16:41.040
accent. And it was amazing. So I had a very good time. It was really relaxing. They started

16:41.040 --> 16:48.720
like massaging my feet. And I was trying so hard. Right, right. This is the truth. Okay. So they

16:48.720 --> 16:53.200
massaged this bottom part of the feet. All right. But with someone touches the bottom of my feet,

16:53.200 --> 16:58.880
my feet go, I start to spread my toes. So I was like, no, stop, stop. She's trying to work on my

16:58.880 --> 17:07.920
feet. But my toes were like, so I was like trying to sell my body. I was trying to tell my body,

17:07.920 --> 17:12.720
stop moving. This poor woman is trying to like massage my feet and give me a relaxed experience.

17:12.720 --> 17:19.520
And all my toes want to do is go, like, no, just relax. But anyway, it was a really good

17:19.520 --> 17:23.600
experience. It was really relaxing. The chair started vibrating. I started sweating as well in

17:23.600 --> 17:32.480
the chair. It was like vibrating me up and down. I was like, oh, right. This is all I hear about

17:32.480 --> 17:37.680
from you Americans watching right now. I don't know what summer patch kids is, but all I hear

17:37.680 --> 17:45.520
about it is how good they are. It says sour, then sweet. If it's a gummy, like chewy, I love chewy

17:45.520 --> 17:57.920
sweets. So this is actually going to go quite down well. They look adorable. These are cute ones.

17:57.920 --> 18:05.600
I like the look of these. So they're chewy. This will hurt your teeth. It is gummy. They're okay.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.600
Ready? Bottoms up.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.920
Okay, we had a good start, but...

18:22.320 --> 18:30.000
Y'all eat this shit. Where did the flavor go? One earth? Wait, there was so much flavor

18:30.000 --> 18:34.320
at the start and it's all gone. It tastes like nothing. It just like gels them.

18:36.240 --> 18:45.200
Where's your flavor? Oh, it's so plain. I don't think I want to swallow this. Hold on a minute.

18:45.200 --> 18:51.680
What the heck is even in here? Sugar, sugar, corn syrup, modified corn starch, contains less than

18:51.680 --> 18:58.480
two percent citric acid. What the heck is the flavor in? Artificial flavors, titanium,

18:59.440 --> 19:06.400
dioxide for color. There's literally nothing in it. What on earth? Wait, I'm not swallowing that.

19:06.400 --> 19:16.640
Sorry, I don't trust it. I don't trust it. It's too suspicious. It's too suspicious. I'm sorry.

19:17.360 --> 19:23.280
That tasted flavor. I'm sorry to anyone who like silver patch watermelon. You're done.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.080
Your taste buds are cooked beyond belief. Nothing happened. You get the burst of sugar at the start

19:30.080 --> 19:34.960
and then nothing happened. So I do apologize to silver patch kids. Right, we're just going to

19:34.960 --> 19:41.280
draw this little mask out here. So he's got his little head and then he's got his wee arm out to

19:41.280 --> 19:47.280
the side and he's holding the watermelon and he does this and he goes down and does this and

19:47.840 --> 19:52.640
this and then he does that and then he goes like this and then he and then back to the head

19:52.640 --> 19:59.360
and again the ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. And then he doesn't really have features. There we go.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.960
Silver patch kids, I'm so sorry but nothing happened when I bit into that which is

20:05.840 --> 20:12.240
rather strange. It's odd. Sweet taste, the carcinogenic that a bloody old knot. Oh speaking

20:12.240 --> 20:19.360
of carcinogenics, neon blue. I got access to neon blue peeps. Now I'll tell you this.

20:20.320 --> 20:27.920
What's her face? Trisha Payes is an influencer and she ate these on camera and made them look

20:27.920 --> 20:34.480
like the most delicious thing ever. Wait, why are you saying no to peeps? Are they bad? But they're

20:34.480 --> 20:41.760
gleaming and green and fat free. Fat free just means it's all in the sugar. They're like neon

20:41.760 --> 20:48.080
blue. I don't know how to explain to you how neon blue these are but these are neon. They're horrible.

20:48.080 --> 20:58.160
Oh no. They look so adorable. I'm eating sheepsters right now. Oh, well come with me. Am I gonna,

20:58.160 --> 21:02.240
all right, vote someone if I'm gonna spit this out or not. From your guys's reactions I'm getting

21:02.240 --> 21:18.320
nervous. But look how cute he is. He's very sticky. Oh my. I'm scared.

21:19.120 --> 21:34.880
I think I'm gonna gag. Am I gonna gag? I'm so sorry. I'm actually quite scared of it. I'm scared

21:34.880 --> 21:46.960
of the bunny. I'm so sorry. I think I didn't spit that out. I apologize. Okay, I got taste. I actually

21:46.960 --> 21:55.120
don't think it's that bad but I'm genuinely scared of it. I'm scared of this. Chewing on foam kind

21:55.120 --> 22:02.000
of quality. Yeah. Does it taste awful as everyone? It doesn't taste bad but I'm scared to swallow it

22:02.000 --> 22:10.480
but I never tasted anything that was bad. I'm just scared. Yeah, it didn't taste bad so it's

22:10.560 --> 22:18.560
going in. I wouldn't eat it of my own violation again. Volition, violation. So it's going into the,

22:18.560 --> 22:23.280
it's not, it didn't make it here. What does it, what does the box look like? Where's the box? Oh,

22:23.280 --> 22:30.080
peeps doesn't really have much of an icon. It's just kind of peeps. Volition, vial, of my own

22:30.080 --> 22:36.080
violin. I would not eat this again. Peeps. And then it's just got a circle. Oh, again,

22:36.080 --> 22:43.440
I messed it up and an underling. Ta-da! Oh yeah, it's all coming together. Oh, pardon me, I'm burping

22:43.440 --> 22:49.040
out. Oh, I never even thought that I could throw up this stream but it's now just occurred to me

22:49.040 --> 22:54.640
the likelihood of me throwing up is actually very high. Can I get a TWS check if throwing up on

22:54.640 --> 23:03.520
streamers allowed? Yes or no? Right, going on the back, sweeps, shriek-p-d-p-p-d's. I've got Twinkie!

23:03.520 --> 23:10.080
And there's literally a zombie movie that's all about the dang twangie. So please, we'll

23:10.080 --> 23:22.400
live up to the hype of the twinkie. Yeah, please. I mean, zombie land. Oh yeah. Okay, we're doing a

23:22.480 --> 23:28.080
twangie. Oh, it's all coming apart. Uh, itadakimasu!

23:33.520 --> 23:38.320
Okay, a sponge cake. We can manage that. What about the filling?

23:40.880 --> 23:44.880
I've stuck my tongue in the filling, as you can see by the evidence of the in-groove.

23:44.880 --> 24:00.800
Okay, I'm tasting it. It is going in the it's all right tier. Okay, it's going in the it's all

24:00.800 --> 24:05.440
right tier. That's not bad. I wouldn't say that was bad. Twinkie is just sponge cake and cream.

24:06.400 --> 24:11.280
It's going in the, well, anything. I actually don't know what the brand of Twinkie looks like.

24:11.280 --> 24:23.440
And this just says hostess on it. We will create one, and then it stands for

24:23.440 --> 24:30.080
two. There we go. New logo for Twinkie right there. And then we'll put it in.

24:32.000 --> 24:38.560
We'll just do like the actual size. There we go. Twinkie. That's the new logo for Twinkie.

24:41.280 --> 24:46.640
It'll be interesting to see how your hands keep on ticking. I've got Twizzlers, which is

24:46.640 --> 24:50.880
Eric Cartman is my only exposure to Twizzlers. I'm pretty sure he was munching them in one of the

24:50.880 --> 25:00.560
plots. Also, I got rinsed for all of this food. It cost me 53 zollas. Oh my god, they're sticky.

25:01.280 --> 25:11.040
Wait, they're not? Oh, there is an artificial scent that has just came from this. Oh my god,

25:11.040 --> 25:18.880
it's not come from fucking hell. I actually haven't used my strength, you know? Okay, hold on.

25:21.040 --> 25:25.040
Oh my god, it's so sticky. Like, oh.

25:27.760 --> 25:33.200
What is this? They're decent. It's very artificial scent has entered the room.

25:33.760 --> 25:39.520
What is it? It's artificial cherry flavour?

25:44.880 --> 25:50.720
Why does everything say a low fat snack that makes sugar turns into fat? Why is everything

25:50.720 --> 25:58.080
marketed like that? It's so dumb. Oh, I'm tasting it. I'm tasting it. In my mouth,

25:58.480 --> 26:00.560
those two little samples that were on my finger.

26:04.160 --> 26:10.240
It's like edible scentless candle. These are sea bomb sticks. They're health candy because

26:10.240 --> 26:17.280
everything in America is high fat. Big sugar. Americans believe fat is bad, but sugar is what

26:17.280 --> 26:22.320
makes fat. Fat isn't bad for you. It depends on what kind of animal fat is good for you. For

26:22.320 --> 26:28.640
example. Oh, everything is good for you in moderation. I'm still tasting that.

26:31.840 --> 26:37.200
I don't think I would eat this of my own violin. Violin again. Okay, I'll say that. Do you guys

26:37.200 --> 26:41.600
want that? I don't think I could finish it. Do you guys want to take over here and

26:41.600 --> 26:48.400
you finish it for me? Yeah? Okay, there you go. All yours go. Yeah, the focus does not work on

26:48.400 --> 26:55.520
this webcam very well. It's all yours. You can have it. I would... Oh, it's back again. I thought

26:55.520 --> 27:00.240
I wiped it on the napkin. It's already back. Oh, you spat it out too? My pretty little baby bird.

27:00.240 --> 27:06.480
I would not put that in my mouth again. No, I don't apologize to any Twizzler fans.

27:09.760 --> 27:17.280
And then it says pool. Oh, I just noticed that pool and peel. Anyone else pooling right now?

27:17.360 --> 27:24.720
Because I'll be peeling something back later. This joke doesn't work because I'm doing an American

27:24.720 --> 27:31.360
stream and you guys get something stolen from you at birth, but let's not get into that.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.480
How about some Jolly Ranchers?

27:34.640 --> 27:40.000
Any Jolly Ranchers?

27:45.120 --> 27:50.000
Oh, jeez, you need the freaking strength to open anything. My god, do you guys

27:50.000 --> 27:55.440
even get into these? Right, what clore? Choose your clore. Any clore? What are the clores? Right,

27:55.440 --> 28:01.600
we've got a red, we've got a yellow, we've got an orangue. Orangue. We've got green.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.880
So any other colors or clore colors?

28:09.440 --> 28:18.240
Okay, I think there's four colors. We've got lime green, hard candy mango,

28:19.600 --> 28:29.520
and golden pineapple and fruit punch. No way, there's no blue. Wait, I've got Jolly Ranchers

28:29.520 --> 28:36.640
tropical. Is that the wrong one? Did I mess up? Wait, hold on, hold on. No, there's definitely no

28:36.640 --> 28:47.760
blue in here. Unless my elf eyes deceive me. And the wise words of Orlando blue himself.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.760
Don't bite them. Suck them. Oh yeah, you want me to suck on the sweet? Right, well I do a pool.

28:57.760 --> 29:04.880
Hold on, let me, you guys can vote what flavor I try. Let me, for those of you participating at home,

29:04.880 --> 29:13.920
please feel free to use the starter poll. What's this called? Jolly Rancher? I've spelled that

29:13.920 --> 29:23.520
wrong, but that's fine. We've got fruit punch and it's red. We've got mango, which is orangue.

29:24.320 --> 29:36.720
We've got yellow, which is pineapple yellow. Or last but certainly not least green, green

29:36.720 --> 29:43.120
lime. For those of you playing at home, folks, feel free to go into the comment section where you

29:43.120 --> 29:51.440
will see a poll pop up on your screen. That's right, you, the viewer, can decide if what the streamer

29:51.440 --> 30:05.280
eats. Let's see. Oh, fruit punch red. Okay, okay. Je comprende. I just realized it's using my old

30:05.280 --> 30:14.160
freaking description sense or red gang raise up. Okay, so someone says don't bait it, just suckle on

30:14.160 --> 30:22.080
it. Is it suckling ASMR? I'll suckle on something in a minute. That is so red. Holy crap. That's like

30:22.080 --> 30:30.080
red of a pencil and that's the sweet red. I'm getting nervous. I'm getting shaky.

30:30.320 --> 30:40.000
Oh, very strong, very strong flavor, but let it cook, let it marinate, give it a chance.

30:48.800 --> 30:55.360
Yes. That is very strong. That is very strong flavor. I'm not even going to

30:55.360 --> 30:57.600
be getting otherwise. What the fuck? That's so fun.

31:05.840 --> 31:16.000
Is it sour? It's just overwhelming. I think my British, my British beans, I just want bread

31:16.080 --> 31:17.680
and butter and cheese and ham.

31:26.720 --> 31:36.320
How fried is America's taste buds? Are your taste buds fried at all? That is so strong.

31:36.320 --> 31:45.200
They're all fried. Yeah, I like savory flavors. This is probably the worst for me.

31:47.760 --> 31:54.960
American taste buds are 99% sweet. Okay. The British can't, yeah, the British palate

31:54.960 --> 31:58.960
definitely can't. I can't. This is very, this is too much. I can't eat this.

31:59.040 --> 32:08.480
Mm-hmm. I feel like an old lady sucking on a hard boiled sweet. Oh, you just,

32:08.480 --> 32:14.320
you just be a good wee grandson. I'm bracing myself on my chair. I'm not even going to

32:14.320 --> 32:18.400
pretend otherwise. My other hand is on my chair and I'm bracing myself for these sweets.

32:22.640 --> 32:28.240
Well, if anyone else wants to take over, you're more than welcome to. I have had adequate tasting

32:28.240 --> 32:32.640
and the aroma of the sweet has came through. So if anyone would like to take over, go.

32:35.680 --> 32:39.840
All yours, baby. All yours because I like my fingers so they're not sticky.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.200
Have a little, have a little napkin for dabbing my fingies. Meals and calls.

32:48.480 --> 32:55.520
Right. That was overwhelming and I wouldn't put it back in my mouth again. I'm sorry. A lot of

32:55.520 --> 32:59.280
things. I wouldn't say cast it into the fire. That's not like rejection, but I just wouldn't.

33:00.400 --> 33:09.040
What's the logo of jolly ranchers? It's just a big J-O-L-L-Y-O and then a Ruh and then a Ruh

33:09.040 --> 33:14.560
and then a N and then a C-H-E-R. It's so hard to like jump between the two. And then it says hard

33:14.560 --> 33:24.320
candy. Okay, that's close enough. Our list so far. Do you think anything can even become

33:24.320 --> 33:27.280
A-T here at this rate? I'm getting nervous. I don't, I don't think it's going to work.

33:28.800 --> 33:34.880
It's not looking good. I will post this in high quality after the stream under the tweet because

33:34.880 --> 33:40.400
I actually tweet for once. I just don't like Twitter. Twitter is for doing something very

33:40.400 --> 33:47.920
nefarious on and then closing it 10 minutes after. We'll go that movie. Is this not in the Goonies?

33:47.920 --> 33:52.960
That movie Babe Ruth. Right, because the guy wanted a baby roof.

33:55.440 --> 34:02.080
We need some more, some Reese's. I never got Reese's pieces, should have. Reese's pup, Reese's pup.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.760
Eat em up, eat em up, eat em up, eat em up. Reese's pup.

34:06.320 --> 34:15.520
Oh, there's a big ass peanut bar. Thank God I'm not allergic to peanut bar. I had no idea what was

34:15.520 --> 34:21.120
inside this. Thank God I don't have a nut allergy. That could have went terribly wrong.

34:22.000 --> 34:37.280
Mmm. Honestly? Not bad. I can't believe it. I think we've done it. I think we have an A-T here.

34:38.400 --> 34:44.000
I'm not bad. We're even taking a double bait ladies and gentlemen. That's right.

34:44.560 --> 34:52.320
Oh, a peanut. Just for me. We have an A-T here. Okay. I can put that on the A-T here.

34:54.800 --> 34:59.120
I hope I'm not choking. I better not be. Let's see. We've got an A-T here on...

35:00.880 --> 35:07.360
Who are you? Babe Ruth. Oh, maybe I'm choking a little bit. Hold on. I better not be freaking

35:07.360 --> 35:11.680
allergic to peanuts. Are you joking me? Hold on. Let me get iron bro. Not like I'm broken,

35:11.680 --> 35:15.760
resurrect a situation. Literally, I don't need to go to A&E. Cheers.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.240
Okay. I think the peanut was getting stuck in my throat. I'm not actually allergic.

35:25.360 --> 35:30.560
Oh, that is farted. Did you hear that fart? I didn't fart. The thing farted before

35:31.360 --> 35:42.240
reducing. We did it. We have... Iron bro doubles as an epipen. True. True. Right. We've got

35:43.760 --> 35:51.520
mate and ache. Original fruits. Chewy assorted fruit fans. I like chewy fruit. Oh, push

35:51.520 --> 35:58.880
here to open. Oh my god. Oh my goodness sake. How do you push it? Oh my... Wait. Is there like

35:58.960 --> 36:02.880
an outline or am I being pranked? Right. Am I being pranked? This is push to open. I'm...

36:03.920 --> 36:08.880
Look at the red on my finger. Tell me I'm not pushing right now. Tell me I'm not pushing right now.

36:10.560 --> 36:15.120
I'm getting freaking pranked by these. What am I supposed to do? What... Oh, I missed.

36:16.560 --> 36:22.320
What am I supposed to do? Push here to open. Well, I'm bloody trying. Right. Fuck you. Honestly.

36:22.960 --> 36:30.240
That's... Right. Anyway. Plore is true to plore. Oh, these are jelly beans. Oh, I'm gonna like these.

36:30.240 --> 36:40.240
Um, I'm trying. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. S tier. We've done it. We've done it. We've done it, ladies and

36:40.240 --> 36:48.560
gentlemen. Jelly bean. We've got fruit flavor. Come on. What more do you want? Mate and ache.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.960
Come on. I knew I was gonna like that. I looked at that and I knew I was gonna like that right

36:52.960 --> 36:56.160
away. I mean, look at that. Look at that beautiful people. Should I just leave like little sweets

36:56.160 --> 37:03.680
everywhere? Just a little chip. Oh, what's that? I'll try the green one. Okay, maybe not the green

37:03.680 --> 37:10.080
one as an ache to your... You want the green one instead? You guys can have the green one,

37:10.080 --> 37:16.320
but I'll have the other ones, okay? Mm-hmm. All right, green one didn't taste that nice.

37:19.520 --> 37:28.480
Me singing the praise. Okay, we've got milk duds not to be confused with milk ducks. Okay,

37:28.480 --> 37:34.640
don't get it twisted. It's instructions. Okay, we're going for it. Candy made with chocolate

37:34.640 --> 37:46.400
and caramelia. Any caramelians? Oh, caramel... Wait, caramel dancing. Whoa. Wait, there's no

37:46.480 --> 37:55.680
protective film? Like, at all? There's no protective film in the box or that the candy is in?

37:57.680 --> 38:05.680
Monca S? Shouldn't there be a protective film? Question mark? Question mark? Oh, I'm scared to

38:05.680 --> 38:12.000
eat this now. I'm going to take half, okay? All right, no, I can't. There's caramel.

38:22.160 --> 38:26.720
You know what the British candy called rebels is? Rebels, maybe?

38:27.120 --> 38:38.960
Mm-hmm. I don't hate it. It's not S tier, but I think it's A. I think that's the second

38:38.960 --> 38:45.360
A tier. I like that. I would eat... I would put another piece in my mouth again. See, if I wouldn't

38:45.360 --> 38:53.280
put... Or maybe it's B tier, I don't know. A or B. I've got lotion on my tentacle, or I mean it's

38:53.520 --> 38:59.280
or... I've not got lotion on my tentacle right now. Sorry. Sorry for the milk duds. Milk.

39:00.160 --> 39:04.800
It's stuck on my teeth, by the way. I just want you to know. Do you guys want any? Hold on. I got

39:04.800 --> 39:16.800
it kind of hard. There you go. It's really stuck on my teeth. Holy crap. It's really, really stuck

39:16.800 --> 39:20.800
on my teeth. I think I'm just gonna have to give up chewing and just put it on the...

39:21.760 --> 39:29.760
But that isn't that bad. Not a good look, LaLa. Oh, that's really stuck. Where's my water?

39:29.760 --> 39:34.640
I bought a water. I bought a water. I brought a water. Hold on.

39:40.560 --> 39:45.120
Need it. Oh, please don't fall on it. Please don't fall on it. Please keep it inside. It's okay.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.920
Oh no, no, don't. It's fine. It's fine. I'm okay. Wait, how fast am I getting through these? I think

39:51.920 --> 40:01.600
I've like practically already done them all. Right. Mercy told me I'm supposed to finish on...

40:02.640 --> 40:08.480
Oh, I still got the wires twisted now. Mercy told me I'm supposed to finish on one of these

40:08.480 --> 40:13.440
flavours of crisps because they're so overpowering, but I think it's the tackies.

40:15.600 --> 40:23.200
I can't remember. I think the tackies I'm to finish on, so we'll try chi-o's.

40:24.720 --> 40:31.200
Chicky bit of chi-o's. They are flavoured. Flame it. Please don't, please don't throw up.

40:33.760 --> 40:40.720
There shouldn't be this much trap wind. I'm getting nervous. Okay, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. It's

40:40.720 --> 40:46.560
fine. It's it. That was the bag farting because my hands are sweaty if you heard that. See, little

40:47.600 --> 40:57.280
my hands are nicest. Get the flavour up that nose. Big ol' sniff it a whiff. All right, hold on.

40:58.400 --> 41:08.960
Let us take... They're like red. Okay. Bottoms up, yeah.

41:10.720 --> 41:22.480
Is that cheese? Is that cheese and hot? High taste?

41:27.680 --> 41:34.960
I think... Is that cheese? Yeah, that's cheese. I need to do the spice. Hmm.

41:35.600 --> 41:43.120
Burning my tongue a wee bit. Not like flavour burn, like actual burn.

41:45.120 --> 41:52.160
What do we think? That's honestly... Would I eat it again? Maybe?

41:54.240 --> 42:01.120
All chi-o's have cheese. It's in the name. Oh, chi-o's. Am I saying them wrong? Chi-to's. Oh,

42:01.120 --> 42:08.720
no, it is chi-to's. Cheese-to's. No, yes. Okay, they all have cheese and I've got it.

42:09.920 --> 42:14.320
Honestly, that's not that bad. That's not that bad. I think I would actually eat that again. I

42:14.320 --> 42:20.320
might finish this off. Hold on. That's gonna get an A tier for me. What are they? Cheese-to's.

42:21.120 --> 42:24.240
Cheese-to's. There we go. Cheese-to's.

42:24.880 --> 42:32.960
Living out. Did I put down the other ones that I just tasted? Yeah. I'll put the crisps on the floor.

42:34.640 --> 42:38.240
Honestly, I could be that. Right, I believe this is the last

42:38.240 --> 42:42.320
sweet I have to taste test and then I could just show you stuff around my room.

42:43.280 --> 42:48.640
Because Shibi doesn't go live until two minus one hour in a little bit. Okay, are we ready?

42:49.200 --> 42:58.880
Let's, let's see what's inside. Oh, these are like red as well, like chi-to's. Oh, they've got like

42:58.880 --> 43:04.480
little tiger stripes. Are they supposed to have tiger stripes on them or is mine just carcinogenic

43:04.480 --> 43:19.600
for free? Okay, ready, steady. Oh, they're like natural rolled over.

43:34.480 --> 43:49.600
Oh, okay. Okay, my brain has decided. What the frick is even in this?

43:52.160 --> 43:56.240
Oh my gosh, it's not even in English. Ingredients.

44:04.880 --> 44:11.280
Yeah, I, I, that is so freaking, that is overwhelming. I think that might be a

44:11.280 --> 44:16.800
Mount Doom. You know that. I don't know how that's edible. I think we have two Mount Dooms.

44:19.120 --> 44:26.880
Love the Italian accent. Yep. I'm so sorry. That's a Mount Doom. I can't, that's inedible.

44:26.880 --> 44:31.600
The flavor is overwhelming. There's nothing, there's nothing. Wait, what is the front?

44:31.600 --> 44:40.000
The packet looks like, hold on. Oh, it's just a logo, geez. Has anyone got any? What does that say?

44:43.840 --> 44:45.680
I don't even know what flavor Fuego is, but.

44:49.280 --> 44:56.160
My heart, I'm so sorry. That, there's so much flavor. It's like not even pleasant.

44:56.720 --> 45:06.640
Fuego means fire in Spanish. Oh, it means hot. Okay, je comprends. Sorry to any Italian,

45:06.640 --> 45:15.120
Italian, sorry to any, uh, Espanol, you know, Viva la Mexico. Um, I think we're done. I can't see

45:15.120 --> 45:21.360
any more sweets. I don't have any more sweets. I've eaten them all. Right, what did we rate?

45:21.360 --> 45:28.720
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Okay, the only one that

45:28.720 --> 45:35.200
made it was a chewy jelly bean, and then a baby Ruth, which is a peanuts, and then the Cheetos,

45:35.200 --> 45:43.440
Cheetos, hot. Oh, I just completely skipped on doing that H. Let's see if you can see a bit better.

45:43.440 --> 45:51.040
Yeah. And then we see, is that, I think that's from the Cheetos that I was touching. Nerds is,

45:51.040 --> 45:59.520
it's all right. A and W, uh, creaming soda. Call me a soda because I'm about to make you cream.

46:00.560 --> 46:09.680
Twinkie with their new design logo, milk duds, uh, and then in the, this is the biggest piece of,

46:09.680 --> 46:16.720
it's not really, it's just I can't eat it. The Dr Pepper, Nacropeper with the 23 flavors,

46:17.520 --> 46:24.880
kisses. Yeah, that was an experience. What the heck does that even say? Peeps. Oh, it says

46:24.880 --> 46:30.720
peeps, but I hid the pee. Peeps, I was actually scared to swallow, but I didn't actually taste

46:30.720 --> 46:40.160
bad. This is Twizzlers, pool and peel. And then this is Jolly Rancher's Heart Candy, that was

46:40.160 --> 46:47.920
again overwhelming. And then the D, which is the mysterious, mysterious watermelon flavor

46:47.920 --> 46:52.160
that disappeared the moment you literally put it in your mouth. Like you taste the flavor,

46:52.160 --> 46:58.480
the moment it enters and then it's gone. And then unfortunately, Fuego, uh, Takis, uh, are just

46:58.480 --> 47:02.560
overwhelming to the point that you do not even have any taste buds by the time you've finished

47:02.560 --> 47:10.560
actually eating any of these American snacks. Did you enjoy the poison? I absolutely did. I

47:10.560 --> 47:14.960
missed half the stream, but I'm gradually making it. We've got an S tier. That's all I wanted out

47:14.960 --> 47:19.360
of this. We've got an S tier. Again, if you're wondering why I'm not using an actual tier maker,

47:19.360 --> 47:23.040
it's because I was too pepego, so we're doing it by hand. That's right, ladies and gentlemen,

47:23.040 --> 47:30.720
I'm so professional. I did this by hand. Okay. Oh, your voice seems better, by the way. It is

47:30.720 --> 47:39.200
slightly better. Um, I did have a T before stream to try and hydrate. Oh, oh wait, hold on.

47:41.040 --> 47:45.840
Oh, oh, excuse me. Sorry. I just need to get that pencil one moment, please. Just need to

47:47.360 --> 47:53.600
grab the pencil. Oh, thank you. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Yes. Okay. I've got the pencil. That's what

47:53.600 --> 47:58.480
I needed it for. Oh, did I tell you I got manicure and pedicure, by the way? Oh,

48:00.640 --> 48:06.960
I can show you my little tism. I don't know if I've told you this yet. So if you look

48:08.400 --> 48:13.200
right here, as you'll notice, these, all these red marks, and then you'll notice right here,

48:14.000 --> 48:20.080
it's because I do this all the time, all day long. I do this. I shove my feet in the ground,

48:20.080 --> 48:26.640
I sit on my feet. So I have a perma, like little indent on my, my toe bone right here.

48:27.280 --> 48:33.120
And then right here, yes, because I always do this and curl my feet up, my little, my little feet.

48:34.160 --> 48:42.480
I'm a toe curler, smiggle, literally smiggling out here. But yeah, that's all the food I have to

48:42.480 --> 48:49.280
review. But I maybe have some fun, cool things to show you. Do you want to see the ASMR that goes

48:50.320 --> 48:55.840
like it goes bloop bloop bloop? Oh my god, I didn't want to show feet. Oh, I did it

48:55.840 --> 49:00.960
stuff for free, like and subscribe, by the way. But yeah, like I go, it's so pretty. This is what's

49:00.960 --> 49:10.000
blooping in your ear when I do all my ASMRs. Like I put the, I did this, I put this on your ears

49:10.640 --> 49:15.440
as well. If I put this on your ears and go, I woke up still in bed. I love you,

49:15.440 --> 49:24.000
mummy. Your nails are so pretty. Thank you. You like that? You like that? Oh, I had a ruler. So

49:24.000 --> 49:31.280
you guys, if you guys have a ruler, I got a ruler so you can, you know, if you want to measure your

49:31.280 --> 49:40.640
hand and you can see how my hand matches up to you, you know? So if your hand from here to here,

49:40.640 --> 49:46.880
okay, is, oh god, you guys do inches, don't you? Oh no, I never thought this through. What the heck

49:46.880 --> 49:53.520
is this? That's centimeters. Oh no, this is centimeters. Oh no, I didn't think this, this part

49:53.520 --> 50:03.440
through. Okay, so what size is your hand in centimeters chat for no particular reason? What

50:03.440 --> 50:09.600
size is your hand in centimeters? Just if you ever wanted to know.

50:12.240 --> 50:17.200
What the heck is a centimeter? My pronouns are USA.

50:19.760 --> 50:27.520
Google translate centimeter. Go, go, go. Someone says 6.5 centimeters for no particular reason.

50:27.600 --> 50:37.280
Wait, 6.5. Hold on a minute. You're, if you're 6.5 centimeters, you're here. Okay, 6.5 is here

50:37.280 --> 50:49.360
and it's my hand. Maybe it looks nicer. Someone says 10. If you're 10 centimeters, you're here.

50:50.320 --> 50:57.440
If you're 10 centimeters, this is outrageous, truly. Oh, you've got such big hands. Why has

50:57.440 --> 51:03.600
everyone got such big hands? Someone says 8.5, 8.5 is here. Man, you guys got massive hands.

51:04.400 --> 51:12.080
The width of you, someone says 21. Yeah, right, 21. This entire ruler is 15 centimeters, so I doubt

51:12.080 --> 51:21.120
you're freaking 21. That's, that's a, we're hit, we're hit with a, if you are, so this is 15 centimeters

51:21.120 --> 51:30.000
long. So if you're 13, your hand, your hand is 13 centimeters. We're doing this. Okay, we're doing

51:30.000 --> 51:40.880
this if your hand's 13 centimeters. This one's it. So yeah, that's absolutely awful. Right, right.

51:43.440 --> 51:52.240
So here's zero and here's 10 centimeters. You already knew it was coming. Let's go. Look at that

51:52.240 --> 52:00.880
manicure. Look at that manicure. Wow. So there's 10 right there. Look at my toe. Oh my god. I look

52:00.880 --> 52:12.480
so feminine right now. Are those my toes? Are those my toes? What else do I have to show you?

52:12.480 --> 52:17.360
That I'm mildly interesting. I might be doing more hand cam streams in the future.

52:17.600 --> 52:21.840
Because look what I got. I got fake nails that look like me.

52:23.520 --> 52:29.840
Wow, little straw nails. Oh, look at the things. These are like, oh, hold on,

52:29.840 --> 52:33.680
hold on, aim bot. These are like little fake nails that you do this. You just put them on.

52:33.680 --> 52:39.360
Look, I'm, oh my god, I'm strawing cuttles. She's eating with her feet. I've already ate,

52:39.360 --> 52:46.880
mercy. I'll finish the tier rating. I'll quickly catch up. Make an acme, oh my god,

52:46.880 --> 52:54.400
I get it now tier. I got lotion on my tentacle is baby, Ruth and Cheetos, hot. I mean, it's all

52:54.400 --> 52:58.880
right. It's Nerds, A&W, Creaming Soda, Twinkie with the new logo and Mike Duds,

52:59.760 --> 53:09.520
Milk Duds, pardon me. It's the biggest piece that is Dr Pepper. Kisses, Peeps, Twizzlers,

53:09.520 --> 53:14.560
Pull & Peel, Jolly Ranchers, Hard Candy. That was overwhelming. And then cast it into the fires

53:14.640 --> 53:21.040
of Mount Doom itself is Watermelon Catch Kids and Tacky's Fuego.

53:23.440 --> 53:26.880
I'm sorry, that's my tier rating. I was like so freaking

53:27.920 --> 53:34.320
thingy. I feel like Peeps is rated too high, but yeah, I'm gonna, if you don't like

53:34.320 --> 53:40.640
hand cam streams, I'm sorry, but I just, I'm gonna fuck a little bit. And this is the part where you go,

53:40.640 --> 53:52.240
ooh. But yeah. So, why else do I have that's even mildly interesting? Oh, I like collecting

53:52.240 --> 53:57.520
seeds of many varieties. Would you like to see my seed collection? Oh, I don't mind showing some

53:57.520 --> 54:02.880
of it. I've not added a lot of seeds recently because I've been so busy with work, but I like

54:02.880 --> 54:09.120
collecting seeds. I think they're really cool. It's my seed collection. Though it's not finished

54:09.200 --> 54:13.920
or labeled, I need to go back and label them all. But I have loads of seeds and I like collecting

54:13.920 --> 54:22.160
seeds. You know, everyone's got a weird hobby. Mine's collecting seeds. But there you go. These are

54:22.160 --> 54:31.760
all my seeds. And there we go. All these sample sizes of my seeds. I do have other bigger ones.

54:31.760 --> 54:37.120
I don't grow plants because I have to rent, but one day maybe I will not have to rent and then I

54:37.120 --> 54:44.160
can have my CDs. But those are my seeds. And they're all super cool. So the thing about seed

54:44.160 --> 54:49.280
collecting is you have to make sure they're dry or else your specimen will actually mold because

54:49.280 --> 54:54.320
if they don't dry, then they mold. And it's not good for obviously you don't want moldy samples.

54:55.680 --> 55:03.440
But yeah, these are pepper seeds. And sorry it's not labeled. Australians call them capsicum,

55:03.440 --> 55:12.880
but these are peppers. The British call them. Like again, I can tell that these are wild Irish

55:12.880 --> 55:23.840
seeds just from I and I just collect seeds. I like them. You can see the difference in the

55:23.840 --> 55:28.240
seeds as well. It's absolutely stunning seeing what nature provides. Because look in this jar,

55:28.240 --> 55:36.800
for example, look how unbelievable. Do you see those dots? Those are entire seeds that grow into

55:36.800 --> 55:42.240
big magnificent plants. And then compare them to the size of this seed. Isn't that amazing the

55:42.240 --> 55:51.520
diversity of plant life? And the seed as well. Also, some seeds can be the vessel that they carry to

55:51.520 --> 55:57.520
the next location for the plant to spawn. So you can get these are wind seed carriers.

55:59.280 --> 56:08.480
Which is crazy because obviously in comparison, these are wind carriers. And then these aren't

56:08.480 --> 56:14.240
wind carriers at all. They have to be taken away via animals such as birds. Like when birds feast

56:14.240 --> 56:17.760
on berries and the seeds inside it and they swallow it and then they fly away and poop.

56:17.760 --> 56:23.600
That's how the new plant emerges because there's no direct competition. Whereas if you get seeds

56:23.600 --> 56:28.000
that have direct competition with one another, that's how you lower the odds of success. Like

56:28.000 --> 56:32.720
honestly, it's beautiful and fascinating when you look into the world of seeds. And yeah,

56:32.720 --> 56:37.040
I just think it's really cool. And you can get some that are so similar. See, these are both

56:37.040 --> 56:43.120
wind carrier seeds. They both get carried by the wind. They look very similar, but there is a

56:43.120 --> 56:49.920
differentiation between them. But flowers steal each other's thing. As they develop in, you know,

56:49.920 --> 56:59.040
the rising of emergence, it's really fascinating stuff in my opinion. But it might not be that

56:59.040 --> 57:05.680
interesting from a stream point of view. But yeah, these are my samples. So let me just put them back

57:05.680 --> 57:10.800
on the shelf real quick. The fact that I actually picked one up doing that, I don't know if you can

57:10.800 --> 57:19.040
see that. Wait, let's see, I picked one up. But yeah, those are my seed samples. I am planning on

57:19.040 --> 57:24.560
getting a lot more, but it's currently winter in Australia, which means my samples are very limited.

57:24.560 --> 57:30.800
I gather these naturally by going through spring or by going through walks and just doing that kind

57:30.800 --> 57:39.440
of thing. Like, for example, on one of my walks, I got a chestnut. If you didn't know this is, you

57:39.440 --> 57:43.680
know, those big chestnut or conkers, you might call these conkers if you're old school British.

57:45.360 --> 57:53.760
But I also have bigger sample sizes as well in these, where I just took an entire sample of the

57:53.760 --> 57:59.920
stem with the seed pods inside. I can actually take the sample out because my hands aren't too

57:59.920 --> 58:04.880
sweaty. I'm not going to ruin the sample. Oh, it's not even going to come out. I don't want to break it

58:04.880 --> 58:14.560
apart. Ah, well, those brown bits are the seed pod. And then you can see where the stem it grew from.

58:15.440 --> 58:22.960
And you can actually see where the flower is budded. So if you didn't know, seeds don't form

58:22.960 --> 58:29.920
until pollination occurs. And that's what flowers are for. It attracts insects to come to the flower

58:29.920 --> 58:38.000
and merge the pollen and the stem. And it's absolutely fantastic stuff. It really is. And it

58:38.000 --> 58:44.720
helps with plant variety and genetics. Like, and the fact that the seeds you can't tell, I've not

58:44.720 --> 58:51.760
labelled this one yet, but I know what it is. This turns into a big, humongous red flower. And you

58:51.760 --> 58:57.120
would never be able to guess that from the sample of the seed pods. So you have to break open these

58:57.120 --> 59:01.920
seed pods in order to get access to them. These like little bits that you see coming off, those aren't

59:01.920 --> 59:08.320
the seeds, those are the outside of the pod. But inside is the seed housed right now inside these.

59:08.320 --> 59:13.120
So I'm not going to break those open when I put them into a sample jar, because I don't need to do that.

59:14.880 --> 59:21.760
But yeah, that's one of my hobbies. So it looks like little buds. Yes, humongous. Well,

59:21.760 --> 59:28.560
education. Did he talk me plants? Yes, the ovum. And, uh, goodness me, I've forgotten the name of

59:28.560 --> 59:35.840
the stem. Oh, I've forgotten the name of it. But it's very important to have plant genetic variety,

59:37.440 --> 59:43.520
which is why pollinators do such a fantastic job, such as bees, wasps. Yes, even wasps are

59:43.520 --> 59:52.880
pollinators and tons of tiny little bugs, so many tiny little bugs. But to increase genetic diversity,

59:52.880 --> 01:00:00.320
which gives resistance to plants perishing, that's why it's really good for all these little bugs to

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:09.520
mingle amongst all the flowers and all of that. Bats to pollinators? I didn't know that. But yeah,

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.000
I guess they can be. This is the doorbell hoax sector I'm talking about. It's just in my...

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:20.320
Well, none of the food section. We've still got an hour to ramble, but I'm not even prepared

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.600
anything else. I actually thought it would take a lot longer, but I kind of steamrolled that,

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:29.680
didn't I? I don't really have anything interesting to show. Oh, this was the toy that makes the ASMR

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:37.040
noise really good. But if I go like that against the ear...

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.400
You did speed and run at it. Yeah, fun nerd now over hobbies. Just keep rambling, please.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:58.800
This is what... What could we put this as a substitute for? Huh? We wouldn't say this resembles

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:07.600
any body part. Would we... Take the... I actually don't have anything else interesting to show. I

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:12.320
showed everything at the start of the stream. I showed you the outfit I wanted to wear. I mean,

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.400
I could open it up if you want. I thought that... Oh, I should have hit there. Oh dear. I can't

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.080
believe it. I can't believe I'm not ginger. But yeah, this was the outfit I wanted to wear,

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.360
but then I realized I can't freaking do it because it's not the... Oh, we can even assemble it right now.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:43.680
Come together. Yeah. There we go. See, there's one little cuttlefish ear. It's not a cat ear. I

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:49.360
don't want to hear any allegations that it's not cat ear. I'm with the Pintis. Exactly.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:57.840
But yeah, if I can get it in. Oh, that won't fit. Oh no, the fabrics ruffled up.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:09.600
Squishy cuttlefish plushy merch when? I don't know. Soon, maybe? If the U-Woo market sales go good,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:16.080
soon. If they don't go so good, maybe not so soon. There's my cuttlefish ears. As you can see,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.280
I'm shimmering like my pearlescent outfit. And then this is the bow for the bow.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:28.480
As you can imagine, it doesn't really leave much to the imagined. I can't even figure out what way

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:34.640
this goes. Okay, that looks like I'm supposed to put... Yeah, so that's the front. And then that's

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:41.920
where I put my... Wait, is that the front? Oh. Oh, that's the front. Yeah. So as you can imagine,

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.840
there's a reason why I couldn't put this on today. But that doesn't mean we can't do it another time.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:03:00.000
I'm just doing the buttons at the gravitational area. Just do that, and I'm gonna assemble the

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:07.840
costume. Yeah. Okay, so that's the bottom of it. And this bit goes around my neck. So it's like I'm

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:13.440
collared. And then this, what is this? This is just extra fabric. Is this for my feet?

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:26.080
Is this for my feet? This can be for hands. There's no hand. It is! Hold on.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:34.240
You know what time it is. There's no way this is for my feet, but I think it is.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:45.280
Oh. Oh, that's a terror. Oh, there's no way that's for my... Yeah, that can't be for my feet because

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:52.400
they ain't non-six. But that won't look like a massive rubber. That's awful. No, that can't be

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.400
for my feet. But what would it be for? It's a dead end. It's literally a dead end inside. I think

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:04.720
it is for my feet, but obviously it's just cheap quality. Because yeah, this is not... This is my

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:11.120
hand in it, no. Oh my god, it looks like the Gryffindor. It looks like the Sorting Heart from

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:19.360
Frickin' Harry Potter. I don't know. Well, you're not twice. I'm cutting eye out. Yeah. Okay, maybe

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:25.600
it was good that I tested it out. That was not gonna work. Oh, but then I have... Oh, maybe I knew

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.640
it wasn't gonna work. Oh my god, past me. You've done amazing because this is what the other thing was.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.640
I was gonna try it. It's supposed to be

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.240
pearlescent, but I guess just the top is the pearlescent charm.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.040
Sleathering. You would have done well. Sleathering. Hold on. Let me just...

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:55.200
My feet are sweaty, so it means stuff gets stuck to them, which is not very pleasant. Hold on.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:03.760
Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.480
You can kind of see the toes done too.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.800
I don't know. I can like see the bit that made out. I'm supposed to do like that probably.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.960
Who said our god is an awesome god? Are we singing Gospels out here?

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:34.400
Okay, that's enough giddy-fitting. Giddy-fitting? That's not a word at all. I will do that another day

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.920
for this costume, although maybe it might not be a live stream and it might just have to be

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:45.840
pictures or something if you guys want to take a Donothon reward. I don't know. I still need to

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:51.680
figure out Donothon rewards. Azura is the first to have a Donothon at the other headquarters.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.160
I need to help her coming up with some stuff because we're going to be doing lots of group

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:08.160
activities. Wait, I just thought that was her hand, but it was her foot. I thought I just

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:19.760
been on a glove now. Take me to church. Have I done... I have eaten all the American food.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:25.680
I have nothing more interest in the show. Oh, maybe... Okay, so this was my concept that I had.

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:32.080
Give us a soul flash, but it would be so wrinkly because I have to like turn my foot up in order

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:41.760
to give you a soul flash. So this was my concept for an ASMR series, okay? So we could do it on

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.600
Pyro Pups. Well, I was going to do it on the girls mascots first if we managed to get plushies of

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:54.000
them. And it was going to be like this ASMRs for Pyro Pups only, for example. And it would be like

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.600
because Cinder is on fire because she's so hot type thing, I would get the microphone. So you'd

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:07.280
see the microphone. So like, hold on, I can literally give you a live example. So the microphone,

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.040
like it would be a hand cam type thing, but I wouldn't do it live. I would make like an actual

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.440
professional video out of it. And it would be like, so because Cinder's always hot, Pyro Pups need to

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:21.200
cool down because of how hot she makes them. So I would do like with a little spray bottle and I'd

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:29.040
go like ear to ear. And then like that was and then whatever was related to and like, I would say

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:34.400
some lore about Cinder like, oh, Cinder started streaming last year on this day. And since then,

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:39.440
like she's had this collection come out and she's been able to achieve this and she's done that. So

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.720
it'd be like ASMR for those who are in the fan base. And I teach you lore about the person. And

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:49.040
then like, I would relate to it as well and be like, because Pyro Pups are such good boys, they

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:53.280
also deserve head pat ASMR and like pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat pat, you know?

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:00.560
Like that. When did you do that? I've not done it, but this is my theory for like an ASMR type

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:07.920
series that I could do. And like, if a creator's come out with a plushie, so like again, this is

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:13.280
Darling Strobe's plushie. And I'd be like, oh, so Darling Strobe started her journey five years ago.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:20.400
I think it was roughly five years ago. No, I don't think hers was as long. And like, I would just

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:27.760
tell Facts about the creator and I'll be like, oh, she's been making ASMR videos since 2021 or

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.400
something like that. And like, she's really found a good groove and she uploads like that kind of

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.800
thing. And then because Strobe's so cute, we would like, I would offer it a little strawberry and

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.280
then I would double over it and go yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. And then when I get the girls

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:48.640
plushies, I'll like all do like super maxed out. And then I can tell behind the scenes stuff about them.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.520
And Mercy gave me permission to say this, but if I get the snippets plushie,

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.600
do you want to know what Mercy put on the end of her application that also helped strengthen

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.880
her application to Veiler? She put, I have autism and she went, she got in.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:12.000
She put, I have autism. At the end of that application, it says, uh, is there anything you

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.280
want Veiler to know about you? And she goes, I have autism. And I was like, oh, and you come,

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:19.280
and you come. Gotta look after the fellow artists. So then she comes.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.480
So yeah, please don't, uh, please don't think Veiler ain't gonna take a look at you because

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:32.880
you're autistic. Nah fam, the spearheads fucking got the combo of everything going on. So don't

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.280
you worry. Uh, but yeah, I was going to like do like a smart, that way everyone's plushies.

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.440
And then it also means if there's any creator that has a plushie that wants to send me it,

01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:49.440
so I do like a, like a series on them as well. I'm more than open to it. I can get a PO box.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.160
So if you are a creator without plushie that you can reach out, but obviously don't do it right

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.600
now because I'm not even started the fricking series. I was going to start the series off with

01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:01.760
the girls plushies because like I would have to do like research on others. Obviously it's really

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.160
easy. I can just bomb the dns and be like, Hey, what do you want me to say? Uh, our type thing.

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:13.600
Um, whereas like for other creators like I have to do my research. Okay, I have to do my research.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:20.640
And obviously like if it's she beats plushie, for example, this is the, this is the ASMR you're

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:25.040
getting right right on the, right on the face. I hope strobe doesn't jump in the stream. Oh my

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:33.600
goodness. She's going to be like, what are you doing to my plushie? Um, but yes, I can send you

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:43.040
but yes, um, I wanted to do it like really in character and all of that jazz. So I might do

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.720
a series like that. And I think the ASMR would be pretty Pog not going to lie. I think it would be

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:57.600
how one says a poke champ. Oh my gosh. I can't believe it. Darling strobes plushie knows how to

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:09.360
highland dance. Fogger is champed for years even. She's enjoying, I'm sure. Oh, well feel

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:18.640
strong and kill seas. Oh yeah. Not that kind of seed sample. Don't send that kind of seed sample.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:27.200
That's a bio hazard for one. Did you know that swimmers can last up to 48 hours in the,

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:38.160
the womb? Which is why you need to be careful and wrap your willy. Don't be silly. You don't want

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:44.800
to pay child support. Don't give her the opportunity to leech your income. Be a child support. Don't be

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:52.160
silly. Wrap your willy. I'm just turning this into a mascot now. Well it's not my mascot, it's not

01:11:52.160 --> 01:12:12.880
a re-film but. Was it a Mike and Ike? Just life advice, I know. Thank you for the message

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:19.120
plushie. I know Darling strobes plushie. I've completely forgotten. The fan base evades me,

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.440
the name of her fan base. Her darlings? Possibly? Very plausible, it could be her darlings.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:31.520
But yeah, I know Senders is pyro pop. I could definitely do that series once we, oh my god,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:40.080
what happens if they kissed? Oh this is boy slumber parties versus girl slumber parties.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:52.640
I've not really been such a child. I've not like had a chance to actually play with toys

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:58.000
many a year. I'm sure that's not a surprise to anyone. But yeah, this is so cute and like

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.600
how much detail. Also, I didn't know this. When you order for makeshift, it literally tells you

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:08.960
like how lucky your batch is. Like Hellhound, I don't know if you can read that, hold on.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.320
It says, oh hold on, where's camera? Hold on, find camera, find camera, come on, you can do it.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:23.360
Hellhound, Wolf plushie by Cinder. Only 697 made, but it doesn't give me my number I don't think.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:32.560
Just says it's official merch. Oh wait, what? Okay, they're called, if you're a darling strobe,

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:42.080
you are a Snickers? Like the bar? And you've only got 294. There's only 294 of these made and I have

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:49.360
one. So yeah, I was hoping to do an ASMR series like that. So it's kind of like ASMR and VTuber

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:53.200
orientated, which I thought was really cool because I don't think I've seen anyone do that before.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:07.600
That's what her mascot is called, we're learning. But yes, I am hoping to be a cheeky cheeky and

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:15.280
possibly get the girl's plushies for their birthdays and then I can start up that series.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.760
And it would be really cool because like I would literally open up a like form and other VTubers

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.880
if they wanted to be a part of the series, literally all they have to do is send me their

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.080
mascot, like a plushie of their mascot and I'll do the rest of the cooking. And I would think it

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.840
was like a cool way to get like more VTubers like involved and it's a way that I can kind of interact

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:43.920
with VTubers because I get like, not nervous, but I don't like reaching out because I'm a dirty dirty,

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:49.360
whereas I don't know if the girl is and I'd rather not like force that barrier. Like the barriers

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:56.080
being crossed between like Yumi Plus, like they're all super cool, honestly. Like I feel comfortable

01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:05.200
with Yumi Plus and all that and the VNU girls, I'm all comfy because of all that jails. But yeah,

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.960
like I don't really want to reach out to creators in case they're like, I don't want to be associated

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:18.480
with you. Yeah, that's cool. I get it. I need mascot plushies and Fumos. What's Fumos?

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:26.240
Yumi Plus has been awesome so far. They have. They have. I would like the format and it would be

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:32.400
really cute. Yeah, like kind of like just like a little rundown on your mascot and all that jazz.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:45.760
Just as a warning to the harem in T-minus 40 minutes, your supreme is live. Did you guys like

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:53.200
my hypnosis yesterday? Yeah. I didn't really expect to do any of that, but that was a very good

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:58.720
suggestion. I loved it. Oh, wait, sorry. Do you guys want to, if we're just talking, if we're just

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:04.640
talking, hold on. Let me just, if we're just talking away. Yes. Oh, yes. Kiss my feet.

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.600
You can literally see where I've been pushing in on my toe there. I do this all day, every day,

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:23.440
all day long. If I sit on my feet and all that jazz. Yes. This is my finished tier list. Let's

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:28.960
just, sorry, let me just point out the different sections of the, excuse me, excuse me, coming

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:36.480
through. So this right here, if you can point it correctly, so this is the S tier, which was

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:44.400
this is the A tier. Oh, no, it was Mike and I. Pardon me. Then the A tier, which is, I can't even

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:50.640
read my writing from here. Baby Ruth. And then the Cheerios, the Cheetos, not the Cheerios,

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:58.240
that's actually British food. And then for B tier, nerds. Do you guys, do you guys even have the

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:04.160
ability to do this with your feet or is this like, like, I literally have full ambidextory?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:09.520
Like, I can literally have full ambidextory with my, my grippers.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:22.480
Oh, shit. What happened? Oh, did something break? Oh, no, I didn't. I thought it did.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:27.120
Okay, it's all good. Yeah, you can do that. Yeah. But can you write, hold on, wait,

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.400
can I write the refling's name? Hold on. Hold on. Let's see if I can write your names.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.360
Well, I'm going to write refling, not your names in particular, but that could be a really funny

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:44.240
stream if you really wanted that. Hold on. Okay, it needs to be a bit longer. Hold on.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:48.880
If you, if you weren't here at the start, the lady cut my toe so I actually don't have any,

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.320
a little harder than I thought. Right, R. Oh, that didn't even, oh, that's not even,

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:58.640
okay, there's the start.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:08.160
And he used all my brain. Okay, hold on. It may actually be easier if I do this. Hold on. Hold

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.520
on. Hold on. I got this. Let me click. Let me click. I know you can't see the angle. Let me,

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.960
oh, it's not going down. This is terrible, honestly. Signed feet merch win, honestly.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:25.200
Right. Oh, we're getting there. Oh, that's such a good R. I'm not even kidding.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.960
Okay, that was an interesting E. That was an interesting E. Let him cook, let him cook.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.880
Okay, that's the same problem with that E, but don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:43.840
Don't worry. Up, up, and then down again. Yes, yes, and then an I.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:54.960
And then up again, up again, gently, gently. And then an N. Okay, so down and then along. Okay, so

01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:01.680
on the paper. Yep, and then up a little bit. Yep, and then along. Oh, and then down. Oh,

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:10.960
and then a G with all my might. Oh, and down. One big down, one big swoop, one big swoop.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.520
There we go. Every flu. Oh, wait, we need to do the dot on the I. Hold on. Right about here.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.360
Okay, there we go. Hey, replay.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:33.600
I don't even know how I did that, honestly. Ta-da! Look, R-E-E. Wait, I didn't do the F on the...

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:44.240
That's about your name wrong. I did. That's about retelling. Wait, R-E-E-F. I forgot the F. Hold on,

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:48.080
I forgot the F. Let me try again. Let me try again. I was getting really distracted, but okay.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:55.600
Okay, we need to just... Oh, hold on. Okay, hold on. You just hold that tight. Froggy likes that bad boy.

01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:02.080
So do the F, and then it's got to be a flick at the back. And then, and... Oh, there we go. Oh!

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:10.160
Tell me that isn't like neat. I literally just drew cursive with my feet. Please clap, seriously.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.920
I just drew cursive with my feet. Reefling. You can see that clear as day.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:22.640
It is so good. Recovered F in the chat, which was right. I can't believe I did that. There we go.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:28.240
That is amazing. I've got so much skill. I do. I've got so much skill in my little toes.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:39.120
I was actually putting insert golf clap. Yes. But yes. That's me goofing around. That's all my

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:45.440
ideas. Oh, you can see my headset again. Oh my gosh, I am a real... I can't believe it. My immersion

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.560
is gone. It's out the window. I do not... I actually think for some reason my feet will probably be

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:56.160
better right in with my right foot instead of my left. I feel like if I wrote with my left foot,

01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:00.160
you wouldn't actually be able to see any... Oh, I just dropped the pencil. Hold on. I'm just gonna

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:08.240
pick it up with my toes because I'm so... See, this is left foot right, and I'm not sure it's gonna work.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.840
Oh, no, it's not gonna... Uh-oh. I don't see. No, you're not even gonna be able to see it.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.400
Oh, jeez. No, that actually hurts to write on the left foot for some reason.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:28.560
There, that's my R on my left. It's so good. If you can do this, what else can you do?

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:35.200
I don't know. Where's the ruler? Hold on. Where's the ruler? Where'd it go? Oh, there's a

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:45.760
sample here. Let me take a little sample at why not. These are called bendies. These are...

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.000
They actually use hook seat technology. I think there's four ways of seat dispersal,

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:56.720
and these bendies are called hook. They hook to the fur of the animal who's been near the plant.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:04.560
Uh, don't be afraid to... Don't be afraid to focus in on the seed. Come on.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.600
Oh, well, I try. They've got little hooks on them. It's pretty impressive, honestly.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:18.000
Anyway, that's just me and my obsession with the seeds. What about you? What's your weird collection?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.680
Look at the mess I've made. There's just chaos on this desk, right? I'm not even kidding. Let me just...

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:38.160
Like a huckleberry. Write in a feet script with feet as well. What, you want me to type on the

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:45.040
keyboard next? I mean, I could. You guys are going to see my gamer keyboard. You want to see my

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.080
gamer keyboard? It lights up. Hold on. Let me put the book on the floor. Our tier list is out the window.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:57.200
Uh, excuse me, Giro. I'm afraid due to the nature of the medical emergency, you're gonna have to go up there.

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:04.080
Oh, no. Is the wire pulling? Okay, what do you want me to type in chat? I don't think... I can't

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:08.480
pull the wire any further, I don't think, and I can't really remove the webcam because of the way I've

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:15.760
set this up. Okay, what do you want me to type in chat? I've literally have chat open. What do you

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:23.760
want me to type? You want me to type PogChamp, right? Okay. Oh, I missed. Hold on. I think I'm

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:41.440
missing everything. Oh, shit. That did not work at all. That did not work at all. I thought I nailed

01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:50.240
that. I'm not gonna lie. I thought I nailed that. I did not at all nail that. Like, not even close.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:58.880
Not even close. Okay, give me another word that's short to try. I'll like really try hard it, okay?

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:06.080
The gripper. Literally, oh, you can't see it, but I like do this on the end of the table.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:12.560
What do you want? You want cuttles, right? Really try hard. Okay, I can't even see it. Okay.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.920
I can tell I'm like inputting so much other stuff.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.560
Did that work? Did I miss? I did it! I freaking did it! Let's go, baby.

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.160
Just like that. Honestly, give yourself some practice on something new. If you've never

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:44.720
typed with your toes before, all it takes is a second chance and you nail it, apparently.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:51.680
Oh, yeah. This is my keyboard and this is my mouse mat. Can you tell who's on the mouse mat based

01:24:51.680 --> 01:25:00.800
on the hair? I ain't clean it, but it's, it's Jinx from, from the hit TV show, Arcade,

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:07.120
or League of Legends if you play League, but I like Jinx. It is Jinx. God, you guys are really

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:13.520
good at that. What the heck? No, I don't think there's anything else I can show really. Yeah,

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:21.200
maybe although, you know, look, look, it's the, the thingy. This is, so I bought the technology

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:27.600
that lets me do all this, but I never use any of it because I'm a bad VTuber. I'm a naughty VTuber.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.560
This is what I'm supposed to do like mid-game. I'm supposed to be like,

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:40.240
let me change real quick, but yeah, it's not happening with me. Sorry, but I ain't not good,

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:46.000
but this is like how I control my hypnosis. So have you never seen like the behind the scenes

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.720
on a VTuber? This is what it looks like. This is what I'm supposed to do, but I never do it.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:59.840
I've got a bikini toggle. Well, let's not do that. Oh, that's a tipper. I will hold you in

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:03.840
my hand. What did you say? Is Brian talking? I don't think Brian's talking right now.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:13.120
There's no Brian in the stream. I don't know why. Oh, oh, I missed another tip from a random

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.960
refling, some random refling tip that said, I heart feet, narrow tip. Thank you for the tip,

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.920
said feet dexterity level 100. Just unlocked literally a little bit of a, but yeah, if you've

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.720
never like seen the behind the scenes of a VTuber before, like I'm happy to show like, I don't

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.800
mind. Like, you know how I always complain about calibration? This is why, this is why I calibrate

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:41.040
to and like, there's my spit pile. Look, this is very spit out all my stuff. Look, there's my half

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:48.000
chewed up foods, half twizzler. That's the caramel one. That's my peep. Yeah. And then that's James.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.360
Hi, James. Hi, hi. But yeah, I don't really mind showing the behind the scenes of it.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:03.120
It's just, just what it is. I don't bother me. No. So yeah, this is when I'm taken. I'm like, oh,

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:11.360
yeah. Oh, yeah, I took that. So good. Oh, my freaking, my preview of my live stream just died.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:20.160
And I thought I just died, but I didn't. Indirect kiss on the food. Do we have the same desk? I

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:27.520
built this desk myself. I needed a really wide streaming desk and it costs like $400 to get it.

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:33.760
So I bought wood and I painted it and then I attached legs. So it's an extra wide desk. It's

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:43.520
like super wide, super wide, super wide. This is literally just turning into a handcam stream,

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:46.880
right? What game, what game we playing? You know the streamers that like only show their hands?

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:57.600
Oh, also, let's play also. Oh, oh, oh, let's get it. Actually, you paint wood, that could look

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.680
but yeah, she could build as furniture with a perfect way she'd be

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.240
playing the Binding of Isaac. Oh, my gosh, should we?

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.360
Yeah, maybe, maybe I should maybe not make the focus on the keyboard of this stream.

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.520
You know, let me just move that back over there. You go over there. There you go.

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.400
Oh, it's bumping on something. It's not. Oh, I broke the legs on this keyboard.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:35.360
Do you feel in? See, funny you mentioned in a full Elden Ring placer with feet. I was actually

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.760
going to do a foot cam stream to show how much I don't have my feet on the ground. I'm currently

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:46.640
sitting on my feet yet again. And I thought it would be funny to play a game where I show feet,

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.640
because like when I get stressed, my feet also go like that with my toes. Like I have a lot of

01:28:50.640 --> 01:29:01.680
emotion in my feet. Maybe. Oh, I do have something to show you. I can do this. It's a special shoutout.

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.760
I'm allowed to do it. So the artist is, I can't freaking, I need my glasses on so badly right

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:16.400
now, is LinkedIn Art. And I can also say this before anyone cries. I also say special thank you

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:24.880
to Dapper Bucket who commissioned the artwork. But for next week's streams, I have Elden Roll,

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:31.600
Elden Roll, nice enough. No, I have Elder Scrolls, Skyrim part one and part two. There's

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.840
are two back-to-back endurance streams for full achievements. We're going to get them together.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.920
Hopefully I can do it on Xbox Game Pass and then we can get our first 1000-gamer score.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:46.880
If not, then we'll play Vanilla. Then we have our classic ASMR stream which will be short.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:56.800
And then we have the first indulge gen-mate stream. All six of us are going to be on Power

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:02.080
Watch Simulator and there's going to be a little plot line to go along with it, okay? You're not

01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:07.840
ready for what that plot line is. But there'll be a reason why we're playing that game as our first

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:16.560
gen-mate thing. And then I am jumping back on Old School Runescape to beg you guys to give me

01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:24.960
fish again. And then we're playing Crash Bandicoot Warped which is an old childhood game. I only

01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:30.240
remember playing the China Mission when you're a cocoa and you ride the tiger. I used to play

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:35.840
over and over again. And I actually don't remember finishing the game or what it's about. I just

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:42.160
remember cocoa. So we're going to be playing that. And then Buckshot Roulette is my tiny, tiny stream.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:50.080
I am aware that Buckshot Roulette is a very short game. So I might just do a foot cam stream if my

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:56.080
toes look good, if they don't. When are we getting a cavio play through? Not yet, but soon to end.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:03.760
But yes, there are three Endurance streams which are the Elden Rings and Old School Runescape.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.840
Crash Bandicoot, I believe, can be finished in eight hours. So it's technically not an

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:15.760
Endurance. That's just the average Joe's work shift. So Buckshot Roulette can be pretty fun if

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:23.440
you go for high scores. Okay, I've never played before. Someone says Veeler running out of funds

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.080
in the first month so the girls banded together to open a sexy power wash car company. You know what?

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:32.320
If you're just going to guess what the freaking plot was that I was going to make,

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:40.000
at least don't guess it correctly. You've ruined it now. You've ruined the collab. How dare you?

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.840
The whole point of that collab and the reason I picked that game first, I was going to start the

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.880
game with all of them lined up and I was going to be so serious. And I was going to be like,

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:56.640
look guys, the income that Veeler are making is not looking good. We're going to have to open up a

01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.840
side business and we're going to call ourselves like the e-girl washers or something like that.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.080
If you're going to guess it, don't you brand it. You brand the whole reason we're going to play that

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:13.920
game. How dare you? How dare you? How dare you? But only the reeflings that are in here are going

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:19.280
to know you're only you guys are going to know. You're going to know the secrets. But yeah, Buckshot

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.840
Roulette is going to be teeny tiny. I might add feet cam just to spice it up a bit and you guys

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:29.840
can tell me off every time I sit on my feet as I currently sit on my feet. Crash Bandicoot,

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:36.000
eight hour old school, endurance 12-ish roughly. My voice can keep up. Power wash, super short.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.960
I don't know if I'll do a pop-up stream. It's plausible. It's very plausible. I might do a

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:48.160
pop-up short stream. I don't, I'm not going to ask for more than two hours from the girls

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:54.160
collab wise. I don't want to like force them to, you know, do that kind of stuff because they're

01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:01.280
probably a busy one to do their own thing. Keep your feet on the ground. Literally, I can't help

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:06.240
it. Look how red my feet get. I don't know if you can tell but they're all red here because I've been

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:13.920
like doing that again. I can't, oh, oh, oh wow. Okay. All right. Just got a little sensor thing

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:17.760
going on that it do excuse me. Hold on a minute. Just, oh yeah. Yeah, you like that.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:20.960
Look at that. Empty. It's true.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:32.800
We love the story. There's a bandaid on one of them because unfortunately the nice lady that

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:39.520
was working on my feet cut it open by accident. If you didn't know, when they prepare your toes,

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:45.520
they literally take out these clippy caliber things and clip away the skin around your toe

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:51.760
and I started bleeding. So I said, it's okay, don't worry, but please don't do anything to it.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.640
There's no point in putting this on it whilst I'm bleeding out. So I just said do, no, everything

01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:02.320
else. It's fine. It's fine. Oh, it's terrifying. Well, I've heard some horror stories about people

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:10.160
like freaking losing their feet because of like chop, chop. So I'm probably not going to get this

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:16.480
done often. I do have what's called gel on it. If anyone is so inclined to know what this is called,

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:23.120
these are called gel and she literally baked my fingers. She put them under a UV light. So if I

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:30.640
get like any skin issues, it's because she baked my freaking fingers like to activate the gel.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:35.120
You're supposed to go back to the place to get it removed, but I think I'm just going to grow it

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.800
out because I don't want any more chemicals like it was the smell of the chemicals that they were

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:48.560
using on my nails was very, it was rather pungent. It was rather pungent and I really do not

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.240
feel like any more chemicals after eating all those American sweets. I do apologize. I've had

01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:59.760
enough chemicals for one day or for one week. So I'm just going to grow these out naturally. It's

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:05.520
probably going to look really bad. Oh, I've got 10 out of 10. Don't remove the gel at home. It's very

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:09.680
dangerous. Yeah, I was just going to let them grow out and cut it off. I assume it's fine to

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:14.160
let it grow out and cut it off because I'm not really going to be doing. Hopefully I'll get

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.440
monetization soon because the whole point of me getting this was to do a monetization stream

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:26.320
that's similar to this, but a bit different. That's right. I thought ahead enough to make it

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:30.720
similar, but different. Oh wait, similar, but different.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.680
But yes, I love this. Are you squiddin' me right now? Oh, I heard that. Love all the streams

01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:46.720
so far. So glad you're back. You and all your gen mates are on point. 10 tenths. I heard that.

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:54.240
Did you guys hear that as well? You did. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Eternity. What a name.

01:35:55.200 --> 01:36:02.800
Eternity. Thank you for such kind words. Yeah, me and my gen mates are amazing. Oh,

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.360
also, this is how I make jokes. Right, someone quickly give me a joke that I can steal. Quick,

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:12.880
quick, quick, because this is what I do when I steal your jokes. Okay? That's what I do when I

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:18.800
steal your jokes. Brian's back. We did miss Brian, but thank you very much for the tip again,

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:27.840
Eternity. Eternity. A man walked into a bar. You think he would have seen it?

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:30.960
Wait, did that play?

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:34.880
Wait, it didn't play?

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:51.360
Okay, I don't think it's working right now. Something's not quite right. Something's not quite

01:36:51.360 --> 01:37:00.240
set up. I'm not sure why. Okay, just imagine this one goes, and then this one, if it's a good joke,

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:08.320
then this one, if it's a bad joke, and then this one, if crickets. Okay? I don't know why. Sometimes

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:12.720
something's working. Sometimes other times it doesn't work. Oh, sugar. I'm going to make sure

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:18.880
I'm redirecting into Sheevee. Oh my god. Oh my god, you can see me typing. Oh my god, wait, hold on.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:26.320
Is it cool? Like when you can see streamers' hands. Hello, reflings. How, oh, I'm getting embarrassed.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:37.920
Is it going? And then that's right. I'm taping and streaming live. What are you going to do about it?

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:39.440
Nothing.

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.440
No, not really.

01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:58.000
You're so silly. You're so goofy. Oh, that was right. You're so goofy. Are you challenging me?

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:05.920
I don't know how you learn how to tape in school, but in primary school, you had to do this. Like,

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.280
at first as a child, you do this, but then they teach you, like each hand takes over a certain

01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:17.920
section, so you're just like, blah, blah, blah. Do you watch keyboard when typing? Right, this is me

01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:24.320
not looking. The only way I can prove it is by looking up with my Vtuber model. Like, oh, okay.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.600
Let me just get the star position. I am, oh, I pressed caps lock. Sorry. Wait, no, I didn't. Hold

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:39.440
on. Sorry. Sorry. I am not looking at the keyboard right now, but that's because I'm a dirty, dirty

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:48.240
neat that never left the house for two years. So I am kind of used to typing a lot. Sorry,

01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:54.080
but it's just the truth. Oh, wait, I spelled the truth wrong. Wait, wait. There we go.

01:38:54.560 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah. Yeah, so I can tape without having to look. I don't know what it looks like, probably.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:11.840
She's just like me. My gran always gets amazed whenever I tape in front of her without having

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:17.600
to look. She's like, hey, do you do that, strongy? I'm just like, I don't know. We grew up with

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:21.840
technology. You grew up with like coal fires. That's like as far as your technology went,

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:27.440
a little coal fire in the corner of the house. Main or grammar mistake. I went, no,

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.960
do a taping restream. Wait, I can beast you guys and taping?

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.160
How do I do a taping restream? Is there like a website for it? I was going to do, I was going

01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:54.800
to verse you guys in chess. Like 1v1 me and chess. 10 fast fingers. All right, I'll check it out.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.360
10 fast fingers. You should be taping up the dev overkill. It's hilarious. Wait, chess would be

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.000
so cool. Yeah, it would be a chill stream, a long stream, snipe day. I would love to 1v1 you guys

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:15.440
in chess. Before you're like, are you a chess champion? Oh, no, I am not. I suck.

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:20.560
But I also swallow.

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.640
But yeah, we probably 1v1 in chess would be funny.

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:39.840
I literally, I am a chess box champion. Right, let me 100% make sure I'm raiding into

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:47.840
sheepsters after this stream because I am rubbish and I'll mess it up. Hold on.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:56.720
Come on, YouTube. Give me monetization so I can do my pop-up stream. I'm waiting for it.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:09.920
Oh, she's playing vampire of masquerade bloodline. I might need to sit and count for that stream

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:17.040
on ironically. I'm doing collab study. I'm actually doing collab scripts. I keep saying, oh, I'm gonna

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:27.520
do collab scripts, collab scripts, collab scripts. And then I never do them because I get distracted.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.840
It took, and oh, there's like literally food on the back of my hand right now. Oh my god,

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.920
and I knew you told me, how embarrassing, there's just food on the back of my freaking hand. Do

01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.280
you like my, do you like my meat sticks? Do you like how you can see my meat sticks?

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.400
Some people hate that, but I don't know, it's just like, can you see your meat sticks at home?

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:48.800
YouTube, please. I want to use that most honestly. I want to use them too. I've got my

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.840
most waiting for that meat stick. What are they called? These aren't the ligaments, what are they

01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:00.080
called? What are they called? What if I'm freaking name the tendons and the ligaments? Yeah, those

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:07.120
are my meat sticks. So hot. You like meat sticks? One potato, two potato, three potato, four.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:12.400
Right, I have still not correctly redirected into she because you guys are distracting me.

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.560
Stop distracting me. This is terrible. I'm just going to start talking through my hands.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:21.920
Stop distracting me. You're so naughty. Stop it. That's your end point. You're in,

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:26.800
getting closer to you. I'm getting so, you can see the chocolate on my finger again.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:38.480
And there, this isn't even, get off me. Yes, you're right there. You're a terrible influence.

01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.040
Terrible.

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:52.240
Did you lick my finger? Refling, you just lick my finger. You're terrible.

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:58.640
But yeah, this, this is my hand. I do apologize to those who,

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:02.480
get filler, get filler, get filler. Don't enjoy when a YouTuber has hands, but

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:08.640
I don't know what to tell you. Like I also got the, got the feet toes up. Look at that spread. Look

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:15.760
at that spread. Why does, why does that toe, my pinky toe does not come out very much.

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:26.560
Spread. Whoa, my pinky toe. Hold on a minute. Whoa. Wait, wait, why does my pinky toe not spread?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.280
Whoa, wait, when I go to spread my toes, my pinky doesn't.

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:34.400
Ah, it like so crooked.

01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:40.240
There you go. I, I must ask you a question.

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.760
Why is this one like having the time of its life over here? Holy crap.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.440
Could you imagine the grip strength I would have on you? Where's the ruler?

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.320
I'll repeat my, imagine the grip strength. I'll snap it in half in between these toes.

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.760
What does that even mean? I don't know. I'm starting to lose the plot. I think the,

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:13.360
the American can die is getting to me. It's all, it's all the red numbers. It's the red 40.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:22.240
It's going, it's getting to my head. I can't stand it. I'm being taken over. Oh, who say can, who say.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:29.760
Red 40 strikes again. I can't believe it. I'm turning American.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:34.880
I'm like leaving you. I can't believe I actually thought this was a, um,

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:40.800
a fortune teller thing. I was convinced there was going to be like a joke on the other side or

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:46.640
something. You're going crazy. I like, I can't believe it. All it took was a few American sweeties

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:52.960
and I'm going, the numbers. What do they mean? Right. I don't know. I don't know what you guys

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:57.520
want me to do for like these last 10 minutes. I feel, I feel a bit out of my comfort zone,

01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:02.320
but not in a bad way. Just in a, I'm really unprepared. Like I thought we were going to be

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:05.520
at this for a very long time, but we're not. Do you want me to tell you what? I'll just,

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:13.520
I'll just caress this. There you go. Oh, little ASMR orb. Watch to do your orb, orb. I see. Yes,

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:18.800
yes. I'll just caress it. Oh wait, maybe I should get the second one so it's a bit more,

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:30.080
a bit more. Yes, we'll caress these. One week review of the company. You want me to review

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:35.520
via lure? How do I review it? Everyone's doing great. They're all having fun. I'm going to even

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:41.040
review it. Everything's going fine. We've got an exciting thing coming up, but I'm not allowed to

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:48.800
talk about it. Boom. But you know, God respect the, God respect the hustle. Spur the moment ASMR.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:55.920
Employee performance report. Bro, what do you want me to say? Oh yes, all the girls literally

01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:00.080
streamed every single day. What more could I ask for? Seriously? What more could I have asked for?

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:08.240
Visucky coming up. All right. Okay. You want the DLC expansion of Veila already? The Visucky DLC

01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:18.480
to go live? Okay. Not enough burps, honestly. Lord's milk. Nice keyboard. Thanks. Thanks. Oh my

01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:30.800
God. Wait, I can still type in chat. Thank you for being so kind about my keyboard. You're so nice.

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:41.520
Woo. I'm a real, I'm a real streamer. Totally not breaking a VTuber code of conduct.

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:48.640
I was at VTuber code of conduct 101. Don't show that you, do you see this little mark here?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:57.440
That was from the toothbrush when we brushed our teeth on stream. All of the toothpaste leaked

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:03.680
down my toothbrush. Do you want to brush our teeth? Let's, let's brush our teeth. Oh my gosh,

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.080
that's like the perfect time to do it. Hold on. We need to go brush our teeth. We're helping.

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:35.600
All right. People are wondering why I mute when I leave the room. It's because the toilet is right

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.920
there and I really don't want to hear, like, I don't want to give you a chance to hear me,

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:48.000
like, do a big old, a big old job. I am not going to lie. I actually had a tick to hear you as a part

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.720
of this stream. And obviously the Americans have been bubbling up and help out. I'm currently using

01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:59.440
my floor towel and I have a floor towel for how sweaty my feet are. Oh, has everyone got their

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:08.640
make tootie brush? Look, this is my tootie brush. It's so, so fancy. Oh, so fancy. I don't put it

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:14.480
on because it makes a really loud noise and I don't want your perspective to be, what we try and do

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.640
this thing together. I'm going to need to borrow your toothbrush. Okay.

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:28.080
Okay. Does it vibrate? Yeah, I like it vibrate. It's like, oh, that just put water everywhere. That

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:33.920
was very, oh, oh, rather silly of me about how, so I have to snap it in to put my thing into,

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.320
but we're just going to manually brush our teeth. Okay. So this is day two of 21, even though I've

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:55.360
not done it consistently. I'm brushing away the red 40. Red 40 ain't got nothing on me.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:07.200
Oh, I forgot about the moment. This thing just keeps on getting fired. What do you mean? I've

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:17.120
been sweet and then I get, I have done. You need to get behind your teeth as well, like behind your

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:26.800
front teeth and behind your broken front teeth. Just after this stream, I don't want to get up. Okay,

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:35.040
even though after this move. Oh, yeah. We're brushing our teeth right here. Sing gangsters'

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:49.440
parodies. I don't actually know the words that well.

01:49:49.760 --> 01:50:03.840
Okay, I've gotten wet everywhere.

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:16.640
What's your favorite American song? Something from Green Day, probably.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:26.240
Uh, I like the schizophrenia Green Day song. I can't remember how it goes.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:38.720
I like the holiday. What would the schizophrenia one be? He's in the scene as well, as opposed to a

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:54.960
scene as well. One, two, one, go! Lay down your arms, and through the sky, one, two, one, go!

01:50:54.960 --> 01:50:59.360
Oh, there's a new single out by Atadashi Gakko. Wait, hold on, I need to spit.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:10.240
This is my sweaty feet towel. Would you like it? Instead, it's gonna be my toothbrush. Oh,

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.040
shit, that just went everywhere, don't it? Oh, that wasn't the objective, but hey,

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:22.720
oh, it's like all over me as well. I have so much spit. I don't know if you guys like salivate a

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:29.840
lot. Oh, it's on my desk. Oh, sorry. Oh, thankfully the camera's actually out of my hairs in the way,

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:34.960
so you don't have to look at my freaking spit on the desk, clean, twat bag. Oh, well, here you go.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:43.520
Oh, yes, oh, yes, the hood reads in the first place for the... Oh, it's all over the back of

01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:49.120
my hand as well. My god, that really actually got everywhere. Jesus. Some of us salivate a lot,

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:53.520
some of us don't. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. It's even on the keyboard, is it?

01:51:55.360 --> 01:52:01.760
It actually is as well. I'm sorry. I get really salivated whenever something enters my mouth,

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:10.560
so teeth brushing with something. I've actually covered that other thing, actually. I'm sorry.

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:15.600
I just have to use my sleeve. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know I'm gross and minging, okay?

01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:19.040
Look, deodorant's optional. If I'm not going outside, I'm not wearing it.

01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:25.520
Oh, I should probably do that smelly thing, because all my gen mates did that smelly thing.

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:33.600
Okay, we are soon to read into ShoeBee in two minus seven minutes. Cease your heresy.

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:43.840
Would be disgusted. Look, I was raised in a barn. That's all I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:48.000
Hear that chat? She's self lubricating. Oh, you can't say that. You made me read that out loud.

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:58.560
The AFK bubble. Yeah, you like my AFK bubble? Any AFK? Yeah, give filler, give filler, give...

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:02.320
In a barn, is she, Jesus?

01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:04.320
She's...

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:16.320
I feel like I don't have anything else interesting to show. Like, this is it. I'm not that interesting.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:23.200
I'm sorry. Okay, out of raw interest and no more. Where's my pencil? I've already lost it.

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:30.400
Excuse me. You're gonna have to move out the way. Okay. How many?

01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:36.240
Right. What are... Right, this is four centimeters.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:47.360
Four centimeters. Okay, then we'll do the next one. This is eight centimeters for no... Oh,

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.080
you guys can't see that. Sorry, sorry. I keep forgetting the camera's like, not my eyeballs.

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.800
I know that's crazy, but the camera's not my eyeballs. This is eight centimeters long.

01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:05.040
Oh man, I think... This is 12. This is 12. That's ridiculous. I don't know why I'm...

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.760
That's 12. Oh, you can't see it. It's so freaking late.

01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:22.720
Yeah. How many pickles can you show? What's she measuring? 16.5. That's all fours.

01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:26.160
You guys are not out here for that much, holy shit.

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:38.880
16.5? Shut up. I'm sorry. What? That can't be. This... This ruler is 15. I'm sorry,

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:49.120
I refuse to believe that. What? No way. My reflins are packing. I mean, actually, hold on.

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:53.440
I don't know. The marshmallow's beg to differ.

01:54:55.120 --> 01:55:03.200
19-0-5. No, I don't believe yours. I don't believe yours. That's outrageous. That is so much blood

01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:16.560
flow. Like... I don't... That's... I'm still going. Like, I'm still going. There's no way. I refuse.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:24.720
17! No. I'm... I'm still going. I'm claiming like a monkey with hands. There's no way. I refuse.

01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:32.960
You guys cannot be that packed. How does that work? Don't you know, like, get lightheaded or something?

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.240
That is outrageous.

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:45.520
No. Why are we measuring our hands like this? Wink, wink. We're measuring our hands.

01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.320
Like that.

01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:02.160
How do you do this? 14. That seems more reasonable, but that's still a bit outrageous. I have to admit.

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:08.800
14 is that. That is still really...

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:17.520
I don't know. Hold on. I'll redo 12. I'll redo 12 so we can actually see it because I can't actually see

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:26.160
that with my eyeballs. Oh, why? What? Why did that not show up? I wonder because of the green undertone.

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:40.160
Hmm. Yeah. My goodness. Now convert that all into inches. I don't know what any of this means in inches.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:47.920
So I love to hear you pronounce different words with your accent.

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:55.920
Apparently I say dual wield quite satisfactorily and strawberry is quite satisfactory and ghetto.

01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:08.080
This girl. 2.5 centimeters is one inch. So two point... All right, hold on. Do it like this.

01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:13.120
Do it like this. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Let me kick. Let me kick. So from here,

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:22.960
one inch, 2.5 so then that makes that two inches. 2.5. So that's three. That's two. That's one.

01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.800
What does that mean? Five and then plus two is ten. It's four inches. Yeah. And then we'll

01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:36.880
halfway. That's five. Then we'll halfway again. That's six.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.080
Yeah, I'd say you're, you're, woohoo. Let's go. Woohoo.

01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:51.280
You're good to go. You start. This is, this is getting painful. This is getting,

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:57.280
we've had enough at this stage. I will, I will teach you a very fun fact. Maybe a later date.

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:08.400
But as a woman, I had to go see a woman doctor and I got diagnosed with a clam. Okay, let's just call

01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:23.520
it Tate Clam Syndrome. Okay. So this, woohoo. This, this is, oh, oh, you're hurting me. Like,

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:36.640
so, yeah, this is, so higher than this. Our lure. Yeah, I'll get to go.

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:51.120
Yeah. I mean, I don't mind. I think if we end up doing bands,

01:58:51.600 --> 01:59:02.560
streams, I'm happy to show you my, my figurines and I will show you why I have a certain type of

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:10.400
figurine from a super underground elite video game that no one's heard of. Okay. And I'll,

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:17.360
I'll show you why I have a certain type of figurine and I'll explain it in a lot more detail.

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:22.160
But apparently, none other than Shibi Cottonbump has just gone live. So we're going to end it there.

01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:26.800
Are we happy? Are we satisfied with the hand cam? Have I done enough fan services? Everyone happy?

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:30.000
Do you have any last requests? Any last requests before I go?

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:42.000
Remember a game. Yes. Today is trying to stream we learned. Yeah. Ending on a high note. It was fun.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.880
Yeah. Everyone happy. Thank you for stream. Okay. I did everything. I did everything. No

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:51.360
requests. Okay. I'm happy. Everyone happy. Peace sign and stick out your tongues model.

01:59:52.960 --> 02:00:01.920
I can do that. Flip me off. Yeah, you like that? See, some people, some people bring this in.

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:10.720
Wrong. This is wrong. It's, it's back to back L's. Okay. You need, you need to give them the L back

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:16.160
to back. That's how you do it. Okay. You want hand holding? How do I hold your hand?

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:25.520
I hold it like this. If I ever see you at a convention, it's over. This is how I'm holding

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:30.000
your hand. Oh, or like this because apparently you guys are absolutely humongous. So I'm just

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.040
going to hold onto your thumb. Do you just be walking around the convention?

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:48.560
I don't know. Got you. End with a heart. I'm, some do that, but then the fingers in the

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:55.600
background are in the way. So I'm, I'm all in like this. Okay. I'm all in some do this. Like it's

02:00:55.600 --> 02:01:00.080
supposed to be the love heart from the bomb. I don't know if you can tell, but this is supposed

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:03.200
to be the bottom of the heart. And then it goes like, Oh, well, I ran out of room there, but you

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:11.200
get the point. Is there any other way of hearts? Do your middle finger if you really wanted.

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:15.120
I'm starting to make stars and stuff up in the touch.

02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:24.720
Wait, that's a heart sign. This is a heart sign. It's the bottom of the heart here. So it's supposed

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:27.920
to be like bottom of heart and then tee tee. That's a heart sign.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:36.640
You can do the hand heart. I do feel, I feel, full stack. I think there's another way to do it,

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:46.000
but I actually don't know. I did feel stack. I thought the thumb and the finger made the heart.

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:52.640
Like that? What? Like that? The thumb and the finger make the heart?

02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:57.520
Well, no, you guys are learning how my brain is slow. It's not looking good.

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:08.720
But yeah. Isn't it because the two tips of the fingers form a heart? What? What are you smoking?

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:12.960
We've made a, we've made a, we've made a diamond.

02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:20.880
No, the one you said was a bomb. Oh, wait, this is the love heart part. And then it like crosses

02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:27.840
over obviously because that's how fingers work. Huh. Interlocked fingers. Yeah, you like that?

02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:36.560
Yeah, they really do it for you. Like Flappy Bird. Oh, wait, what's that thing where

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:42.960
you do that and then spin it? What? Wait, hold on. I'm sure there's a thing where you spin it.

02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:47.200
Oh, there it is. Diddy, diddy, diddy, diddy. You used to have a thing where it was like,

02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:54.080
oh, it's a boy. Diddy, diddy, diddy. I can't remember. Can you do a shadow pop it?

02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:58.000
Oh, wait, dogs have two eyes.

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:08.800
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:18.000
Scuff dog. How else are you supposed to do it? Very big underbate. Look, he's a, he's a pug. Oh,

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.680
wait. Oh, no, that's what a dog looks like.

02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:23.520
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:30.400
Someone says, you're Australian chat, bro, you're about to be redirected in the

02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:36.240
sheebie yeti-like. Yamest it. Hand shadow stream. I don't know. How would I do a rabbit?

02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:41.120
So those are the ears. Where's its face? I don't know, how does its face feel like?

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:53.200
Wait. That's too hard. This is too hard for my brain. Okay, I am going to let you raid into

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:59.840
sheebie's pantalones. I've had a really fun hand cam stream. That's the first time I've

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:03.360
ever done something like this. I hope you enjoyed it too. And if I get monetized,

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:10.000
then you will begin something similar, not the same. Similar, not, not the same.

02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:17.360
Similar. Okay. Similar. Yeah, you're like, I got my nails done. Did you see? You notice

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:24.880
it's showing off my nails? Got them dead. Okay, you loved it. Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I didn't

02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:28.880
know what to do, honestly. I was like, I don't really know what you guys want. Like,

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:33.120
we'll review these sweets. And now I have tons of sweets that I don't like. Do you think I could

02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:36.560
send them to the girls and pretend that they're a cure package, but really I just don't want to

02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:44.640
eat anything? Okay, that was so fun. Thank you so much. I'll see you all tomorrow for

02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:55.920
oh wait, it's Elden Ring for Foostroda. And I'll teach you all the strats on how to get 100%

02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:00.720
achievement playthrough. Whoa, is that as bad for you as it is for me when I see the preview?

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:07.120
My hand, like, just teleported. But I hope you enjoy my French tips. You know,

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:17.520
a ha ha, wee wee baguette for my, oh wait, hold on. French tips. Yeah. Thanks to the stream,

02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:22.720
Elden Ring. That keeps saying Elden Ring. It's not Elden Ring yet. Elden Ring is the motor. No,

02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:27.520
next week. It's Elden Scrolls. I keep getting Elden Ring and Scrolls messed up right now.

02:05:27.520 --> 02:05:32.880
Yeah, these are French tip nails. That's what these, this is the style. They paint the white

02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:39.120
on it, but it's like my natural nail color and everything. It's called French tip. You know why?

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:46.000
Because I'm French and I'm giving you the tip the night, boys. Right, enough, enough.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.760
Sheeby's live. Please enjoy Sheeby to your heart's content. Thank you so much for watching me rate

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:55.440
American sweeties. Where the heck did that come from? That just flew out of nowhere. I got afraid.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:06:00.240
I thought it was a spider. Thank you so, so much for stream. I will stop rambling because I'm

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:04.160
holding you up. I'm holding the line of command. Please enjoy Sheeby to all your might. I will

02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:09.120
see you tomorrow for two endurance back-to-back streams. So get ready to strap in. If not,

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:11.840
I will get strapped on. See you tomorrow.
