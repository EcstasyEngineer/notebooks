WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
I haven't really messed up the settings for this, but I'm having a stroke.

00:25.000 --> 00:54.000
I think that's the timestamp for the movie.

00:54.000 --> 01:07.000
Good morning, good evening, and good afternoon to all the Reflings from all across the world.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
I can hear myself. Stop talking a moment. Stop it.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Closing all my tabs and...

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh right, I've closed everything off.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Right.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
No.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
You may be sent yourself.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Strongly!

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Wait, my mic is delayed?

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
Is my mic delayed?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
I think...

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
I think my microphone is delayed as shit right now.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I just...

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
No?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
It's a...

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Hmm.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Could you raise the gain?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Out of sync a bit?

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah, I see that too, what the fuck?

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Why, Mr. SMB, what's wrong with you today?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
You're on the correct sentence.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Of course, like, oh my god, Mercy couldn't have spoke true words when she said,

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
everything you do, you can change not a single thing from the last thing you did yesterday.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
And the ting's having a stroke.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
And all the good time.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I don't really want to reset it because it's got filters on it.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I've had fucksack!

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Yeah, the model's looking a bit odd.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Leave my out of sync model alone, okay?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
The pilot...

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
The pilot and the mecha aren't cooperating, okay?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I can't believe it.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Testing.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
What, what the fuck?

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
The SMB's delayed by, like, a second.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I don't want to delete it because I don't know what filters are on it.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Wait, I do.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I've got de-noise and gain on it, and I'll need a read.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
How much gain?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, for fuck's sake.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Testing.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Why are you delayed?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You're stressing me out.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Why?

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
I'm literally doing ventriloquism.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm watching it be so delayed in 4K.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
What the heck?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Can you forgive me?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Can you forgive me if we...

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
Because to be honest, I'm going to be pretty quiet whilst we're watching the movie anyway.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Hi, good morning. I'm so sorry.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Right, you're just going to have to forgive me.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I think it might be clashing with everything I've got with the movie set up.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
That's my only guess.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
It's my only guess.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm not smart enough for this.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Let's see.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
I mean, technically watch the movie.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Yeah, if you guys can forgive me practicing my ventriloquistic sensibilities,

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
then I'm just going to pretend like I'm not a second out of sync for some reason,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
because SMB's delayed for a second.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Today, we are playing Grinscape.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I have a sugar ton of wine to level up.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I don't even know what world I'm in.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Probably not in a free world, so we can all hang out.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
380 blaze it, please.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Here you go.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Switch world, please.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
So me and the reflins can hang out.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
You're so cute as a vent.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Can you raise the gain?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Of end game or me?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
End game.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Assume you mean end game forever.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Hi.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Okay, my reflins are here.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Or do you mean the microphone?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Because the microphone was cool, huh?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh, wait, hold on.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm a fucking idiot.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
How's that input?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Oh, that's...

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Sorry, I'm bursting your eardrums.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
How's that for input?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh my god, my gain was set to so low.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Oh, oh no.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
My gain on the focus rate was...

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm so sorry.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I'm so sorry.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm so sorry.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Sorry.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
That's cut out.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
No, sorry.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I just realized all I had to do was turn the knob.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
You wouldn't believe how many problems in life

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
can be fixed by turning the knob.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Oh no, this can't be.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Right.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Right, right, right, right, right, right.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Let's get a cheeky update on everything

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
that's happened since I last saw you

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
in Balatro yesterday, okay?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Hear ye, hear ye.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
For those of you who are a member

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
and wrote a membership script with me,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
that audio is now live on Patreon.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
You can hear...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
So you can literally watch the script

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
being made in an hour,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
and then you can listen to how...

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
It took an hour to write the damn thing,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
took an hour to edit the damn thing,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
and it came out to less than 15 minutes.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Arrest my case.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
It literally is redonkulous

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
how long it takes to make these kind of things.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
But yes, that audio is now out on Patreon.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
So all four are technically five in my case

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
because I did have a demo reel to test my voice

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
because I was very confident.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So I technically have five audios on Patreon as well.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It looks like your model's behind the audio,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
which means your model...

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
No, the model's not out of sync.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
The SMB's out of sync.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
This fucking thing is delayed.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
I can see it not being in sync with me right now.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
It's the SMB.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
It's not the model.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
The model's in sync.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
And I don't know how to put a one-second delay

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
on the model input, so I can't do it.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It's not V2B Studio.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
It's fine.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
We're gonna watch John Wick.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
It's not gonna be that bad.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
However, however, I just don't open my model's mouth at all.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
And then it's less frustrating for everyone watching.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, you didn't think about that, did you?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
There we go.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Okay, next update.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
This is fucking awful.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Next update.

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
My 2000 celebration subscription and video is out,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
where I clean your ears.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
The video almost got limited ads

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
because of my opening sentence.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
This is the silent mouth technique, honestly.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
So, the...

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Aventure?

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
I can't believe Johnny got a mouth wipe shot, honestly.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
But it's the same when you get done for your teeth.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
My 2000 celebration is out.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
The next audio, if you're interested in ASMR or audios,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
is a collaboration with a wolf.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
That's your hint, and that's all you're gonna get.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Teeth clenching ASMR, let's go.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Literally, yay, it doesn't look like I'm out of sync

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
because my lips aren't moving at all.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Um...

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
The viewer isn't being the eventual because of my accusations.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
Oh, no, no, I don't know why it's not...

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I don't know why it's delayed.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Anyway, I just want to preference this stream by saying

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I'm gonna give up my all to watch all four John Wick's with you,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
even though there's apparently a fifth one,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
which defeats the purpose of trying to finish a series together.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Um, I just want to say the likelihood of tomorrow's

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
runescape endurance stream being swapped for something else

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
is astronomically high, okay?

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
I'm back to feeling sick, I'm back to feeling stressed,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
I am back to being constipated,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
and it happens right before the endurance stream.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
So don't think I'm not going on to you, body.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I know exactly what you're doing.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
My body is rejecting endurance streams,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
but I'm saying no, okay?

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Aren't you supposed to practice mental fortitude or whatever?

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Well, mental fortitude, these wines in Edgeville,

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
I'm gonna mental fortitude so hard all over these wines.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Um...

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
So I'm not really sure what's going on with my body.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Um...

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
But my dad is coming over very soon.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
So don't be shocked when you see streams are like

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
no more than four hours a day.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Like, I'm having to break up cameo in two streams,

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
which is crazy, because I can do it in one.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I can do it in one.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
And like, Viva Pignata's getting broken up into two streams,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
like all this kind of stuff.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
I had to delay Shadow of Mordor.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Um...

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Stress does wild things.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Literally, why the fuck does my stress manifest

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
that it clogs me full of shit?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Like, I'm sorry to be nasty with the details.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
But why does mine go...

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Oh...

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh...

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Right, we're a bit stressed, right?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Mmm...

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Okay, enema, enema, give them an enema.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Literally, like, why does mine have to go that way?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Why can't I just be the, oh, I'm exhausted kind?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Like, yeah, I'm a wee bit tired right now.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I guess, yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And I'm not sleeping properly.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Like, yeah, I guess.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
But, oh my God, don't be so selfish.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
Honestly, did you guys, like, man,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
you were short as well about, uh,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
not one in a VTuber agency?

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I will put the movie on in a second.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Uh, A.C. picked a great time to read.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Oh, please tell me you didn't, A.C.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Snowberries, I'm so sorry.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Hi, A.C. and Snowberry berries.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Um...

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm so sorry if you caught the tail end of that conversation.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Hopefully not.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Well, I'm currently having to be a ventriloquist

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
because my, uh, microphone is broken.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
We're about to enjoy John Wick together,

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
so if you want to join in, you most certainly can.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
There's a timestamp as well as you'll be able to see on screen

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
what we're doing, okay?

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Uh, I just need to make sure...

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
you guys can also hear...

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Snowberries? Snowberries?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Snowberries?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
What? Would you still love A.C. if she was Southern?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Well, how do y'all Snowberries?

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
Oh, gee, sons, what are you talking about?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
What do you mean we can't get the hand-jerking off Booth?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Yeah, that's right. I saw that tweet, A.C.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
I saw what happened.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Oh, my little old, my old, gee, sons,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
you guys are such perverts.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Yee-haw!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah, we just all love A.C. if she was...

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Oh, I'm just putting all the wings in.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Southern A.C. can't hurt you, she's not real.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Southern A.C.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
That's right, old, gee, sons.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
The other management's a man.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
So, A.C. is not allowed to jerk off station,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
but I'm allowed the ASMR booth,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
where I just straight up R-word reflins, right?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Something's not going on.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Something's not right.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I'm calling out injustice when I see it.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Something's not...

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Something's not on.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Right, I'm gonna hit play on the movie

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
because I've got a cup of tea.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I love all our daughters regardless.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Okay, understood.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
We'll hire a Southern A.F. for a Gen 2.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Okay.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
We'd love A.C. no matter what.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Alabama A.C.?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
You want Alabama A.C.?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
We got Alabama at home.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
In Canada, in particular...

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Well, she's not in Canada right now, she's on holiday,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
but yeah, we got Canada at home.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
We got Alabama at home.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Her name's Emmy.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Strongly paid-off management.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
Probably the physical contact aspect.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yee-hee.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Can we get a Mongolia?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Wow, and we are not getting a throat singer

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
for Gen 2.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Absolutely not.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Could you imagine?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
I swear to God.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Actually, you know how I've said all this stuff out loud?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
What do you think the odds are?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
There'll be one little shitposting girl

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
that's gonna tickle me f-

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
that's gonna tickle me ivories

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
and make me laugh by coming out with

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
doing Mongolian throat singing.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
What do you think the odds are of that?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I would be...

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I'd be very shocked.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
But I feel like there's one that's shitposting

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
enough to do that.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
You're telling me there's not one girl

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
shitposting enough to be like...

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
That's my impression.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
10% chance.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
AC just wants to do ASMR to another part of the body.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Oh, yeah, you want pee-pee tingles?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
I'd be glad to tell you because I'm boss.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
For coming to visit me.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Oh, gee, souls, I'm gonna tingle you myself.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I'm gonna tingle you right here.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
That's right.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Don't even need your ears for tingling.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Okay, shall we start with John Wick?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Right, are we ready?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Is everyone got John Wick open?

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
That's a lot to unpack.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Please don't listen to my crazy rambles.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
Right, and before there's like eight slime girls

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
that apply to be in Gen 2,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
but in their condition is I'm not gonna be

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
if I'm not slime.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Get your snacks.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Is it?

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
I've got one hour, 41 minutes and 13 seconds.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Everyone ready?

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
Three, two, one, go!

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Fuck, I messed it up.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I'm sorry, I was gonna do the fucking ghost thing,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
but then I fucked it up.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
There you go.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It's blinding me.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Okay, so basically I'm gonna...

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
We're gonna enjoy the movie together.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
Can you guys?

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
You guys can't hear the movie.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
They're not be able to.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I'm gonna be nervous.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh my god, we're doing roller coaster,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
a role play, Thunder Road.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.000
Wow, that was...

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
You need to update that so badly.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
I'm not being funny.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
When was that made?

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
I feel like I could do better in any of these.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Right.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I've got scrawny the only snack I need.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Thank you, Rolly Legend.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
And Brian.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
I'm so out of sync.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Okay, you can't hear it good.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh my god, it...

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Oh!

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
See, that's sometimes when you get your driver's license

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
at like 16 or something.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh!

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I take it back.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
I take it back.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Hold on, let me turn the game sound.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Are we not?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
Is this the end of the movie?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Hold on a minute.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Am I on the wrong movie?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Oh, they're kissing.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
They're kissing.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
It's been many a year.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
What the fuck?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I don't remember this.

17:25.000 --> 17:36.000
Fuckin' Elements in a mansion!

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh my god, he's a 1%.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Get him!

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
No, I'm just kidding.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
That's not what 1% looks like.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I assure you.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Eww!

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
I was the drip from the coffee cup.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
That wasn't correct.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Oh, that's actually really sad.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
What the fuck?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
POV me.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
We were nervous away for a year, Kirkin.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Oh no!

18:07.000 --> 18:13.000
She had a brain aneurysm!

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
No!

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Fuck!

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
That shit will strike.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Sorry, I might...

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Holy shit, this is why we can't watch up

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
before anyone requests up.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
No, I will start crying.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I don't want to cry.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Hold on a minute.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Oh my god.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Bro, am I going to start crying?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
What the fuck?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Why is this movie so sad?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
It's supposed to be about guns and pew pew!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
What the fuck?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I'm like literally tearing up.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
Do you mind video game movie?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Holy crap.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
No, for fuck's sake!

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
There's still short scenes.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And don't worry, it gets worse.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Stop.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Am I allowed to cry?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I'm like crying.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
But it's okay.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I'll smile in a minute when these scenes go over

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
and then we can talk about the pistols

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
and stuff that they use,

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
because I like the guns.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
They always use MPKs.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I don't know, I don't know.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
I don't know.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
I don't know.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
I don't know.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
I don't know.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
I don't know.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
I don't know.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I don't know.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I don't know.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I don't know.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
I don't know.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
I can't take the guns.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
They always use MP5 Kifs and movies

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
for some reason.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Who picked this fucking movie?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
It's been like 10 seconds.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Oh yeah, pys, it's the green Goblin!

20:20.000 --> 20:20.500
Oh.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.020
Oh, sorry.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.600
Oh my god, I'm actually waping away my tears. I can't handle this shit.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.360
Ha ha!

20:50.800 --> 20:51.800
Oh.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.280
I can't drink my tea. Now my throat's closed up.

20:55.280 --> 20:58.720
I don't know if you get it when you get teary, your throat closes up.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.760
I can't freaking drink my tea.

21:10.920 --> 21:15.680
No, wait, this is even sadder because didn't this happen to him in real life?

21:16.040 --> 21:19.240
And he never remarried or dated anyone else?

21:19.240 --> 21:23.240
Ah, where the fuck did I pick this? I'm in shambles right now.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.160
I'm snot coming over now.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.480
Oh.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.040
Oh.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.840
I can't even handle this.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.800
I'm like laughing but...

21:40.040 --> 21:43.320
Oh, I don't remember this phone being so sad.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.120
I just need to drink my tea before it gets cold.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.240
Oh.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.200
Oh my god, what is it?

22:00.760 --> 22:03.720
It better be a breather. It's good and not bad.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.240
What breed is it? If I...

22:08.040 --> 22:10.040
It better not be a pug.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.080
Oh, no.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.680
No!

22:19.480 --> 22:21.480
Oh, wait, what?

22:34.520 --> 22:39.480
What is that? I don't know. I don't know what kind of dog that is.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.680
Oh.

22:45.400 --> 22:49.400
You'll feel better once the killing starts, unironically, yes.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.400
Okay, I'm gonna start telling you about the Makarov and then the invention of the M7-11.

22:59.400 --> 23:05.400
And the utilities of the AK-47, why it's the most popular assault rifle crafted and created.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.400
Oh, hi, poppers.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.400
Oh, hi, sweet thing. Oh, it's so tiny.

23:14.920 --> 23:20.280
Oh my god. Wait, the fact that she knew that he would need something to love on.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.160
No, I can't fucking...

23:23.160 --> 23:25.160
Daisy, no!

23:26.680 --> 23:29.400
This is even worse than you could make it.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.360
Not perfect. It's called...

23:37.080 --> 23:39.080
Absolute shambles.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.960
Who picked this?

23:44.280 --> 23:48.280
Fucks sake, please tell me two isn't like this either. I can't even handle it.

23:51.880 --> 23:57.080
Oh, we popper. No, the popper goes on the bed, you daffodil. Sorry, I don't know.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.720
Yeah, let it on the bed right now. No!

24:01.480 --> 24:04.760
Exactly, that's what I thought. Oh, it's so tiny and wee.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.760
Oh.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.480
Happily ever after fans and shambles at this movie.

24:15.480 --> 24:19.160
Right, I'm gonna try and drink my tea without choking on it and he's stop crying.

24:19.880 --> 24:24.680
Oh, it's like waking in a mop and stuff. Oh, he says, don't...

24:24.680 --> 24:26.680
Daisy goes, don't rot in bed.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.400
Oh.

24:33.640 --> 24:41.960
Well, okay, my tea's called anger-resuming natural emotions reinstating.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.920
Oh, it's got a wee collar and everything.

24:56.680 --> 25:03.800
Oh, he's not got our dog food yet. Yeah. Oh my god, this movie's so real though.

25:08.600 --> 25:16.840
Oh, look at our ee. Look at our wee floppy ears around the bowl. Oh. Sweet.

25:16.840 --> 25:24.920
Oh my god, what a smart puppy for a film crew, honestly.

25:25.960 --> 25:32.920
She's like, I know my spot, I'm getting my treat, I'm gonna go right here. Oh, you're so smart.

25:33.080 --> 25:43.000
Oh, transformers. I'm fucking with you.

25:47.240 --> 25:51.880
Filling up that gas. She said, hey, mama, let me get you a number.

25:51.880 --> 26:06.840
They really said, put the most freaking... Obliette.

26:06.840 --> 26:26.040
Sorry, but Russians are as they've shown us as a bad guy. It's either Chinese or Russian.

26:27.320 --> 26:33.800
Wait, he got his willy chopped off in Game of Thrones.

26:36.840 --> 26:47.800
See you on Greyjoy.

26:53.160 --> 27:01.800
Not for sale. She, ooh, the girl's she, the car's a she. My little puppy.

27:06.920 --> 27:21.640
That guy has 83 in the 86. Close enough. Same number, honestly. They both start with an eight.

27:25.160 --> 27:31.000
Wait, is the young Greyjoy actually a previous speaker or did they just know the lines?

27:31.560 --> 27:37.720
You'll see the Italians in a second, don't worry. Oh, okay. Right, 86 cooking.

27:44.440 --> 27:48.120
Wait, is the puppy in the car when he's going this fast? That thing's sweet,

27:48.120 --> 27:49.960
ears are going to be flapping in the wind.

27:49.960 --> 28:00.920
No, look at the pup.

28:20.760 --> 28:32.520
The truck's almost kissed.

28:36.200 --> 28:40.920
He was using the driving as an emotional outlet for his emotions.

28:40.920 --> 28:50.280
Hi Daisy. No, yes, finally. Dogs belong on the bed. They're so cute and they want to be a part

28:50.280 --> 28:57.400
of the family and they want to be part of the pack. You're supposed to let dogs sleep on the bed for

28:57.400 --> 29:04.360
you because if you don't, it means they're not a part of your pack and it hurts their feelings.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.680
That's right, animals actually have feelings.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.320
Hi Daisy, weezy. Oh, bleat.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.200
Oh, fuck.

29:34.840 --> 29:47.480
I see you.

29:47.480 --> 29:54.480
Brrrr.

29:54.480 --> 30:01.320
Brrrr.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.320
Over this?

30:02.320 --> 30:09.320
Over 69 mustang?

30:09.320 --> 30:16.320
Holy shit.

30:16.320 --> 30:23.320
No.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.320
That's so sad.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
What the fuck?

30:28.320 --> 30:33.320
Did the fuck put this shit on?

30:33.320 --> 30:39.320
No, don't touch her.

30:39.320 --> 30:45.320
I hate it here.

30:45.320 --> 30:52.320
Oh, what the fuck?

30:52.320 --> 30:57.320
I can't even do that.

30:57.320 --> 31:02.320
I can't even do that for them.

31:02.320 --> 31:06.320
Those are such precious wee things.

31:06.320 --> 31:12.320
No, for fuck's sake, don't call her next to her necklace.

31:12.320 --> 31:17.320
I can't even handle this spell.

31:17.320 --> 31:28.320
Oh my god.

31:28.320 --> 31:39.320
Oh.

31:39.320 --> 31:47.320
Bro.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.320
I'm needing cuddles off your reflins after this one.

31:50.320 --> 31:54.320
What the fuck?

31:54.320 --> 32:20.320
I don't remember any of that, I just remember the guns.

32:20.320 --> 32:27.320
And then in the second movie there's like a sauna scene with cool light in it.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.320
That's all I remember.

32:30.320 --> 32:35.320
I don't remember any of this sad shit.

32:35.320 --> 32:42.320
I would have picked this if I knew how sad it was.

32:42.320 --> 33:11.320
I just make my wings like a good little RuneScape player.

33:11.320 --> 33:20.320
Hey wait, my cat.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.320
Did I read that right?

33:21.320 --> 33:23.320
My cat's son stole the car?

33:23.320 --> 33:25.320
We go?

33:53.320 --> 34:22.320
Okay, at least that guy in the suit seems to actually have some tact.

34:23.320 --> 34:28.320
Oh my god, it is my cat.

34:28.320 --> 34:51.320
Sad parts over our body, hope so.

34:51.320 --> 35:00.320
Take that drink.

35:00.320 --> 35:04.320
Shit, it's on the house.

35:04.320 --> 35:09.320
Oh my god, it's that GT map and Grand Theft Auto IV.

35:09.320 --> 35:15.320
And that little underbridge near the taxi depot.

35:15.320 --> 35:32.320
Actually we should play GT4.

35:32.320 --> 35:37.320
Oblivious.

35:37.320 --> 35:43.320
Oblivious.

35:43.320 --> 36:00.320
Ow.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.320
Holy shit.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.320
He's not happy.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.320
Oh my god, I have tears on my blanket.

36:07.320 --> 36:21.320
I can feel them.

36:21.320 --> 36:25.320
Congrats.

36:25.320 --> 36:32.320
He's got other business to attend to.

36:32.320 --> 36:38.320
Theon's been summoned by my cat.

36:38.320 --> 36:42.320
He's gonna go around.

36:42.320 --> 36:49.320
You know shit is real when it's just a singular O, honestly though.

36:49.320 --> 36:54.320
Oh pardon.

36:54.320 --> 37:00.320
Sit down son.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.320
Is he about to get glassed?

37:04.320 --> 37:22.320
No.

37:23.320 --> 37:39.320
Oh.

37:39.320 --> 38:08.320
He's not here.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.320
Per Theon, he always gets beaten up in his roles, honestly.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.320
They're like, oh you're perfect for beating up.

38:13.320 --> 38:29.320
And you're hired.

38:29.320 --> 38:47.320
He's got a punchable face.

38:47.320 --> 38:55.320
Shit.

38:55.320 --> 39:01.320
Holy fuck.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.320
Baba Yaga!

39:04.320 --> 39:25.320
I forgot they called him the boogie man.

39:25.320 --> 39:49.320
Phew.

39:49.320 --> 40:06.320
Oh my god.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.320
A hag witch, eater of men.

40:09.320 --> 40:20.320
Okay, Baba Yaga for Gen 2 confirmed.

40:20.320 --> 40:33.320
And yes.

40:50.320 --> 41:19.320
Here a dead man walking.

41:19.320 --> 41:41.320
Holy shit.

41:41.320 --> 41:44.320
He does say Gigi literally.

41:44.320 --> 42:07.320
He said, oh fuck he's about to bake him.

42:07.320 --> 42:34.320
Oh shit.

42:34.320 --> 42:59.320
He tried it's ogre for his son.

42:59.320 --> 43:06.320
I just got tattoos for this fortune.

43:06.320 --> 43:24.320
Fortuna.

43:24.320 --> 43:31.320
I don't know what his back tattoos said.

43:31.320 --> 44:00.320
Enough goes hard when he didn't say a word.

44:01.320 --> 44:17.320
Oh.

44:17.320 --> 44:34.320
What's happening?

44:34.320 --> 45:00.320
He's got home advantage.

45:00.320 --> 45:27.320
There's the layout.

45:27.320 --> 45:40.320
No his balls.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.320
Actually yes his balls.

45:42.320 --> 46:03.320
Yes everything, they deserve it.

46:03.320 --> 46:30.320
Oh my god that would be terrifying.

46:30.320 --> 46:59.320
We don't want to hurt civilians.

46:59.320 --> 47:00.320
One.

47:00.320 --> 47:17.320
Don't get him involved, it's a messy clean up.

47:17.320 --> 47:42.320
He's in on it?

47:42.320 --> 48:08.320
Police interaction to be honest.

48:08.320 --> 48:34.320
It's like the idea of an underworld currency that the people don't know about.

48:35.320 --> 48:38.320
Oh clean clean clean.

48:38.320 --> 48:43.320
Sorry waste disposals in the background.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.320
Okay okay waste disposal.

48:45.320 --> 48:47.320
I was like 8k 47 time?

48:47.320 --> 49:03.320
No no cleaners cleaners.

49:03.320 --> 49:18.320
They're just in gimp suits, it's fine it's fine.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.320
They just like being in gimp suits.

49:20.320 --> 49:42.320
What is harem?

49:42.320 --> 49:44.320
Ah.

50:13.320 --> 50:20.320
I swear that was literally me in the bag for real for real.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
Your cat also talks Russian?

50:21.320 --> 50:37.320
I know I have such a talented little cat honestly.

50:37.320 --> 50:38.320
Thank you well.

50:38.320 --> 50:47.320
I just say thank you in Russian, I don't know.

51:17.320 --> 51:43.320
You know I'm somewhat of a refling myself stop, that's such a good motto for us.

51:43.320 --> 51:53.320
Oh my god my eyes are all puffy from greeting.

51:53.320 --> 51:57.320
Is that Marlon Manson?

51:57.320 --> 52:02.320
A big nice.

52:02.320 --> 52:06.320
The food fighters.

52:06.320 --> 52:10.320
Oh right what can we identify?

52:10.320 --> 52:12.320
What's going up first?

52:12.320 --> 52:14.320
Can we identify any of the guns?

52:14.320 --> 52:17.320
We have sniper rifle.

52:17.320 --> 52:20.320
Oh I'm shit with snipers.

52:20.320 --> 52:30.320
Fuck.

52:30.320 --> 52:35.320
Bindalk Saints.

52:35.320 --> 52:39.320

52:39.320 --> 52:54.320
Oh it's that skinny building in New York.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.320
At third mate it looks pretty badass.

52:56.320 --> 53:13.320
Reflings you didn't tell me you looked so cool.

53:13.320 --> 53:35.320
Oh no.

53:35.320 --> 53:50.320
Wait a minute I'm getting a memory.

53:50.320 --> 53:55.320
Lance?

53:55.320 --> 53:57.320
Who's Lance?

53:57.320 --> 53:59.320
The gentleman behind the desk?

53:59.320 --> 54:11.320
The concierge?

54:11.320 --> 54:37.320
Oh.

54:37.320 --> 54:39.320
No I can't handle it.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.320
I'm not going to cry.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.320
I'll be big.

54:42.320 --> 54:45.320
I'm a big girl okay.

54:45.320 --> 54:51.320
I'm not going to cry.

54:51.320 --> 54:58.320
You get back in their tear.

54:58.320 --> 55:08.320
I feel like a form of fucking Rocky Horror picture show up in here.

55:08.320 --> 55:10.320
What's going on?

55:28.320 --> 55:48.320
What?

55:48.320 --> 56:14.320
What?

56:14.320 --> 56:42.320
Jonathan.

56:42.320 --> 57:11.320
Two down to the bone after dog died.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.320
Interesting choice of words Winston.

57:15.320 --> 57:20.320
Hey Winnie.

57:20.320 --> 57:23.320
Oh my god is Winnie the Pooh's name Winston the Pooh?

57:23.320 --> 57:48.320
Haha.

57:48.320 --> 58:14.320
It's not business it's personal.

58:14.320 --> 58:20.320
Ooh is that how we skirt the rules?

58:20.320 --> 58:24.320
Don't kiss me you succubus.

58:24.320 --> 58:32.320
You.

58:32.320 --> 58:34.320
Oh he's so fucking humble.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.320
I'm going to start green again stop it.

59:02.320 --> 59:24.320
Hey.

59:24.320 --> 59:28.320
That's me in the Google page.

59:28.320 --> 59:30.320
I don't even know how Google dance and work ends.

59:30.320 --> 59:41.320
I just know it's called Google dance.

59:41.320 --> 59:48.320
Again bullet proofed up.

59:48.320 --> 59:50.320
You met Keanu Reeves?

59:50.320 --> 59:53.320
A promotion?

59:53.320 --> 59:58.320
I see is literally DJing right now.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:04.320
I knew she worked at a nightclub before fucking John Wick nightclub.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.320
Oh shit wait.

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:13.320

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.320
It's me look I got a part in the show.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.320
That's not me that part isn't me.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:26.320
I'm that tall I'm really in that tall I'm tiny.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:33.320
See that can't be me because that model had 10 toenails my apologies.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:43.320
Theon.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:01:04.320
Before she was AC she was the DJ at the continental.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:17.320
She recognizes them.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:44.320
Whoa.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:02:04.320
He is scared he's pretending.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:33.320
I'm having a good time I cried my eyes out.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:43.320
I like when they give a chance for someone who isn't involved in the business to get out.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.320
I can't wait for the fifth movie.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:56.320
I don't even know what three or four consists of I think I've seen two but I thought this scene was in two but I think I'm mistaken.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:42.320
No.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:47.320
Whoa.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:54.320
Hell hath no fury like a man scorned like a husband scorned.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:41.320
No no spoilers for the future movies please because I don't know.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:56.320
Whoa.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:18.320
Shit.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:36.320
Stealth mission failed but we got close.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:59.320
Fuck.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:25.320
Fuck we missed.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:43.320
Fucking AC is good at this holy shit.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:07:12.320
I suppose because of how loud clubs are there is a possibility you wouldn't hear the bullets.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:23.320
Wow.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.320
You know if you ignore all the death the club is banging.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:56.320
They have no in the background AC and strongy DJ collab honestly I'd be so down.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:06.320
Fuck.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:17.320
No civilians remember no civilians.

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:25.320
I didn't know we're in Glasgow.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:35.320
Go again go again.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:42.320
I'm pretty sure you can get internal damage even with a bullet per vest on.

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:49.320
So if you guys are like oh get up John get up no like that shit is impactful as fuck.

01:08:49.320 --> 01:09:14.320
This club's still banging I'm glad they left the music on AC is really dedicated she said

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:26.320
I paid for my shift I don't care what happens.

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:38.320
No no no no no.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:46.320
I would be so winded a kid you're not.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:55.320
I would be me down and out not gonna lie.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:01.320
True DG let's nothing stop their set.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:10.320
Oh.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:15.320
You'll make you swallow them words and choke.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:21.320
Just like I'll make you swallow them.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.320
Oh we're so fucked up.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:28.320
Do they have health kits at the continental?

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:30.320
You have a medic?

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.320
Medic please.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:50.320
Thank you.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:59.320
All the pain.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.320
Oh that was a nasty gas.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:16.320
That takes time to heal.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.320
Oh the wee ice pack on his shoulders adorable.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:38.320
I've never seen those.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:46.320
Bourbon is alcohol that much of a pain suppressor?

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320
This cannot be true.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.320
Have you been stabbed?

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:57.320
I think I'd rather reach for a boot profan over a wee cheeky vodka.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.320
A nasty gas.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.320
Oh you want to see my nasty gas.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.320
You're making it too easy.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.320
If you're drinking off I guess if you get bit faced.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.320
Oh.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:15.320
No.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:24.320
Let this poor man rest please give him 24 hours at least.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:36.320
My boss dinner's night my boss please let me keep him.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:47.320
Wait.

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.320
That was a warning.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.320
Green Goblin's still friendly?

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.320
That was a warning.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:16.320
Can I say something really bad?

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:33.320
I like how the only way that they can go hand in hand is when he's severely damaged.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:51.320
She's only equal when he's 70% dead.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:55.320
Reflins you can't say that.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.320
I can't get a clear shot.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:04.320
Fucking hell she like doing maneuvers on him and stuff.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:10.320
I can't even imagine the pain.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:35.320
Fuck you can't see the shot at all.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.320
Oh he's going to finish the job.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:14.320
Oh you made a mistake lady.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:27.320
Leave my cat out of this.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:44.320
Oh color me surprised.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:56.320
You're just...

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.320
Oh.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:05.320
No.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:23.320
Why don't we convo?

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.320
Fuck I hope they managed to close up his body.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:33.320
He just got the damn stitches in place.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.320
Yeah the director did a great job.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.320
I kind of keep coming back to the dead in the lobby.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.320
I like his voice.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.320
Can I get you some bourbon?

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:53.320
I can't say it though I don't know how to do it but...

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:57.320
Oh!

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.320
You shot a holy man.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:08.320
Oh he's one of them.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:21.320
He really put the holes in the holy man.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:39.320
And you think he won't?

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:45.320
Wait what gun is that?

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.320
M16?

01:17:50.320 --> 01:18:01.320
It's not ACOG.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:04.320
M4.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.320
I was going to say M16 didn't quite look great.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:17.320
I blew all the fuck.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:22.320
He just helped the economy.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.320
We love casting spells.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.320
Shadow Wizard Money Gang.

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:33.320
We love burning money.

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.320
John is a refling.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.320
He understands.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:40.320
Blackrock headquarters.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:19:01.320
He understands.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:19.320
There you go free mustache wax.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:43.320
No.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:51.320
No, no, no.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:20:16.320
Oh come on.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:23.320
Why are we seeing Pina?

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.320
I'm helping.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:45.320
I'm putting down cover fire.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.320
I'd get over there too.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:21:01.320
I'm not going to pretend.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.320
He goes for headshots.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.320
Oh that was actually kind of smart.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:14.320
I wouldn't have thought that myself.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:21.320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:29.320
I think we've been captured.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:44.320
Come on, no, I don't like the look of this.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:22:12.320
We're hazy as well.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:38.320
I don't know, I feel like people change.

01:22:38.320 --> 01:23:07.320
Just one comment Vigo, sorry to interrupt.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:32.320
This is a battle rank.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:57.320
With love.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:24.320
We ain't doing the, this person died because it was in God's plan.

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:53.320
She was my wife.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:53.320
She died because it was in God's plan.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:26:21.320
Oh, I'm 87 let's go.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:40.320
Let's go John Wick for some level 87 and King.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:27:09.320
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:39.320
Oh shit.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:45.320
He's a Baba Yaggle, right?

01:27:45.320 --> 01:28:02.320
Man's tied up and still manages to, he was so pleased with himself.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:13.320
See the way he licked his finger there, like yeah, yeah, I did a good job there.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:36.320
Whoa, I don't recognize the shotgun.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:58.320
What's going on?

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:11.320
Uh-uh-uh.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:44.320
Oh, he's him.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:59.320
Is that one of the, I don't recognize it.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:23.320
Oh, he's already in.

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:50.320
He doesn't like being kept up in the safe house.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:31:01.320
That actor is so good, I don't know how my cat is so good at acting.

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:14.320
Breh.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:20.320
Can't believe I adopted a mafia cat, it all makes sense now.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:49.320
It wasn't a hoarder cat's home.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:32:19.320
I don't know how my cat is so good at acting.

01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:46.320
A car.

01:32:46.320 --> 01:33:07.320
It looks like the same as the other one.

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:08.320
It's another one!

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.320
Wait, am I being pepega?

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:14.320
Is that his car?

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.320
Am I being dumb and it's not the same car?

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:19.320
I can't tell the difference between cars.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320
No, it's the new one.

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:31.320
Okay, my apologies, my apologies.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:39.320
An ally.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:50.320
I thought he said something else there and I was like, oh, in this kind of movie?

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.320
Oh, please, give her a rest, woman.

01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:21.320
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:36.320
Oh.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.320
No!

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:57.320
No!

01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:10.320
No.

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:15.320
Oh, come on!

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:32.320
Our only fucking friend?

01:35:32.320 --> 01:36:01.320
No!

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:28.320
Oh, no.

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:49.320
No, no.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:10.320
It's...

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:37.320
Oh, you're fucking done at no.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:52.320
You've been a bad kitty.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:58.320
Yeah, you need to get out of the country fast because this man's on you.

01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.320
No!

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:04.320
Are we gonna walk in on his body?

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:23.320
No!

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:29.320
No, no, no.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:34.320
I'm crying again. Why do I cry so much? It's supposed to be like an action game.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:38.320
Why? Every friend and ally he makes.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:56.320
Why can't this man have anything?

01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:17.320
You broke the rules.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:24.320
If they were all in a diagonal, point at each other?

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.320
Anyone? Anyone? If they were all in a diagonal, point at each other?

01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:33.320
Uh, no question mark.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:46.320
I'm pretty sure you can get a double kill with one bullet.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.320
With friends like these.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:55.320
With friends like these. Come on, we've still got friends in the city.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:00.320
With friends like these. Come on.

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:15.320
We can do it, we can do it, we can do it, we can get there.

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.320
Aw.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:27.320
The contrast from earlier film where it was like almost cathartic for him to be driving the car?

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:39.320
I mean, I guess it still is.

01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:43.320
Hotel bro's coming clutch.

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:46.320
Oh, he's got his V.

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:58.320
He's paid his road tax. I saw that in the front of the car. It had the V paper. He's paid his road tax, lads.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:08.320
Oh, he's not half him.

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:23.320
He said get off the road.

01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:28.320
What is it called when a police car does a tactical takedown?

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:45.320
Like that, that, that, that, that.

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.320
A pit manoeuvre.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:42:02.320
Oh my God, his senses.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:07.320
It's always an oozy with a Russian.

01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:28.320
There'd be higher pitch.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:40.320
Baba Yaga.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:43:00.320
He's fucking around, he knows he's dead.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:26.320
Oh wait, we see the Matrix guy?

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:33.320
Ah.

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:37.320
Get the gun, get the gun. Pistole, pistole.

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:45.320
Oh, and there's Bill Perf of course there is.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:53.320
Get out, out, out, out. Yes.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:44:03.320
Oh, it wasn't water.

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:12.320
Holy shit, the thunderclap of the car. I know it's raining.

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:23.320
No, come on, aim.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:29.320
Manoeil Manoe?

01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:42.320
Ah fuck that, I'm sorry, you're getting popped.

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.320
No.

01:44:46.320 --> 01:45:10.320
He's like had so many drinks in his system.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:31.320
Now you want to talk, now you want to talk.

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:45.320
I'm fucking cheating.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:55.320
No.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:46:15.320
Ah fuck, we just took organ damage though.

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:33.320
Please be the kidney, we have to.

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:39.320
Oh my God.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:50.320
Is he gonna bleed out, did he get an artery on my cat?

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:59.320
Oh my God. He did.

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:22.320
Oh my God.

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:44.320
We did it.

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:56.320
He's not done? He did it, John, it's all good.

01:47:56.320 --> 01:48:10.320
Where are you? What more business does he have?

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:23.320
Fuck, he can't make it to the con and then offer heals, can he?

01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:29.320
Okay, med supply, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, go, go, stuff the wind, stuff the wind.

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:33.320
Pack it in, pack it in.

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:43.320
Oh that's gonna stink.

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:55.320
Oh yeah, oh my God.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.320
We don't mean to stress you out little buddies, it's okay.

01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:17.320
We're just visiting, we needed the med supplies.

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:24.320
We're going again? No. Why is this movie so sad?

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:33.320
No. Oh I can't fucking handle this movie, he's going again.

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:43.320
Even though he was so heartbroken and that's the scene where she passed away under the fucking Brooklyn bridge.

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:48.320
No, he has enough love in his heart to keep going.

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:55.320
Okay, what the fuck, these are supposed to be PMP movies.

01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:03.320
Okay, what the fuck? Why would you read this?

01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:09.320
Oh my God, he has enough love in his heart to keep going.

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:19.320
And he got a new popper.

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:25.320
I don't even know if I'm avoidable, what the fuck?

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:30.320
Okay.

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:34.320
Alright, hold on, if I've done this, if I've set it up right.

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:40.320
Is there any secret scenes in these movies? No, it's just credits.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:47.320
Alright, I'll let the main credit roll. Oh my God, he has enough love in his heart to go again.

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:53.320
The badass music play and he looks away stronty and absolutely shambles.

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:59.320
Honestly.

01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:08.320
Are you squirming me right now?

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:15.320
Sorry, I don't mean to make you greet at work, thank you fully legend for the tip.

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:20.320
Bruh, what the fuck, I don't remember any of the sad parts.

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:26.320
I just remember being like, haha, cool guns, okay, let's watch John Wick.

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:34.320
Don't I fucking regret it? Well, I don't regret it because it was a bloody good movie, but oh my God.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.320
Right, if I've done this right.

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.320
Oh shit, okay. Does it see chapter 2 now?

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:51.320
Okay, hold on, wait, I need to pause so it's at the start. Does it see 2 on my thing if I've set this up right?

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:57.320
Which along with the t- yeah, so the movie, there shouldn't be a timestamp, but it doesn't see what the movie is?

01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:01.320
Or does it only see what the movie is when I click play again?

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:06.320
Oh, I cannae handle this.

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:16.320
We're also watching, does it say John Wick too? Because I'm smart John Wick.

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:21.320
One piss. Shit, I never did that in time, hold on.

01:52:21.320 --> 01:52:25.320
Can I change it?

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:31.320
I'm, hold on, it should be text, text, text, text, text, text, where's text?

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:38.320
Show me the text foil, where's the text file? Sorry, there's like tons of files.

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:41.320
Okay, hold on.

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:47.320
We're watching John Wick too. Okay, yeah, sorry, I don't know why I thought that was going to happen.

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:53.320
Take a breather? Okay, I'll take a moment. I'm going to get, I think I'll get some food.

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:56.320
I'm going to make another cup of tea.

01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:03.320
That movie? Oh my gosh, that emotional turmoil in that movie.

01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:09.320
What the heck? I don't, I think I'm such a cry baby which doesn't help at all.

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:16.320
Cause like, anything, like, I'm fucking crying just thinking about poor wee John.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:20.320
But like, he had this happily ever after. I got yanked from him.

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:23.320
I got a puppy that gave him condolence. I got yanked from him.

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:26.320
And then he had enough love in his heart to get another puppy.

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.320
It is so sad.

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:31.320
Thank you Dim's doodam for the tip.

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:37.320
Ah, oh my god, it's a picture of a dog. I can see the tip has got a dog in it.

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:41.320
Literally, I can't watch any cry baby films.

01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:46.320
Literally, this is supposed to be an action film and I'm greeting my solo.

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:50.320
You cried the entire movie, honestly.

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:53.320
I can't handle any like, things that.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:56.320
So before anyone says, oh, strongy, watch up.

01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:02.320
No, we are not watching up. I will be distraught the entire film, okay?

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:10.320
Ah, right, if I go get some food and a cup of tea, at least my throat won't be as closed up, okay?

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.320
Dogs are kind of a cheat code to the tear duct.

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:18.320
Actually, anything with like pets or like the happily ever after gets taken away.

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:21.320
I can't handle it. It's so sad.

01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:25.320
But like, I'm okay. Like, I know I'm greeting my eyes out right now, but I'm okay.

01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.320
I promise I'm okay.

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.320
Oh, it's just going fucking there.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:33.320
Oh, right, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.320
He got a new puppy. Life is good.

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:40.320
I'm sorry if I'm making anyone upset by my crying.

01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:46.320
The feature was crying makes everyone unanimously upset. Sorry.

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:50.320
Oh, right, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:52.320
It's an action movie.

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:55.320
Didn't we not appreciate all the guns? Oh my God.

01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:00.320
And did you see the way they reloaded and there wasn't too many bullets in the magazines

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:06.320
that didn't make any sense, like some other movies, like literally every other movie that has like infinite ammo, infinite clips.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.320
So I do appreciate the detail that went into this film.

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:16.320
I have to admit, they casted Big Kenny Reeves perfectly.

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:19.320
I can't believe they casted Makat as the freaking mafia boss.

01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:26.320
Like, sorry, but Makat Vigo, his backstory was that he came from a hoarder home.

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:30.320
It wrong. He came from the Russian mafia and he has to now hide out.

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:38.320
He's now a fugitive in my house as I feed him nibbles and give him those lucky lick pouches that I like.

01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:42.320
Oh my God. But that's like such a good movie.

01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:45.320
I forgot, I completely repressed.

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:52.320
The only part I remembered was the bath house scene because of the light and was like nice neon.

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:57.320
I literally had forgotten all the other aspects of the movie.

01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:02.320
So I don't, I am now unsure if I've actually seen John Wick 2.

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:05.320
I know for a fact I haven't seen 3 and 4. I didn't know they existed.

01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:13.320
I thought I had seen 2, but I only remembered the bath house and that was in 1.

01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:17.320
So I have a sneak in suspicion. I've actually not seen 2, 3 or 4.

01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:22.320
So I have no idea what I'm going up against.

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.320
Who the new enemy is.

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:29.320
As for wines, yep, we're whining away.

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:32.320
I briefly got 95 cooking.

01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:35.320
So I was at 94. Why are you guys ahead of me?

01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:38.320
You've been playing offline without me, huh?

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:42.320
Bath house had some but literally I got hired, but then they, I went to a casting,

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:45.320
but then they denied me because I only have 9 toenails and they were like,

01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:47.320
oh we can't cater to that.

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:50.320
We can't cater to that. That's disgusting.

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.320
I'm like, oh okay I guess.

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:54.320
Like I tried, I tried.

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.320
Sorry, I did some off-screen. No, you're not in trouble. I'm teasing.

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:59.320
Anyone's welcome to level up off-screen.

01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:03.320
1 was, number 1 was 2014. 2 was 2017.

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:08.320
Oh, I don't, um, I, because of that bath scene in the colour scheme,

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:12.320
I thought that was in 2, but it wasn't.

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.320
So I actually don't know what's up ahead, I don't think.

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.320
Nothin' yell, pedicure.

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.320
Actually.

01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:23.320
Ah, astronomy's who says the continental confirmed.

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:27.320
Literally, a new business, eh, we VEGO, no havin' it.

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.320
Oh, right.

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:33.320
And I thought it was your butt because it wouldn't fit on the camera.

01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:36.320
Hey, I like that, I like that.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:40.320
Um, right, I'm gonna take a very quick pause champ.

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.320
I'm gonna get some food. I'm gonna make a cup of tea.

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:46.320
I'm gonna go my little empty teacup here.

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.320
Oh.

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:50.320
But again, it'll be the same setup.

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.320
There'll be a timestamp for anyone that comes in.

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:56.320
I do apologise to any refunds that may have joined at any point and said hi,

01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.320
and I was too busy crying.

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.320
I was too busy crying to be like, oh, I'm so glad you joined us.

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:10.320
As for who's streaming today, I don't have a singular clue.

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:14.320
I'm too busy, absolutely devastated over that movie.

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.320
VEGO is cooler than a mafia boss.

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:20.320
Literally, I'm about to commission my cat in a suit for the heck of it.

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:25.320
But yes, I'm gonna get a snack, I'm gonna heat up some leftovers.

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:31.320
I got a kebab, but I have some pasta left over.

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:34.320
I got a chicken kebab and it has, like, lettuce and onion in it

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.320
and a low lettuce and onion.

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:37.320
Red onion.

01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:40.320
Hey, mome, can you mute RuneScape music?

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.320
Oh shit, sorry.

01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:45.320
I actually left that in so it wasn't just, like, singular me talking.

01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:47.320
Okay.

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:49.320
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:52.320
Everything's muted and I've muted in-game audio capture,

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.320
so it's literally just my voice.

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:55.320
That's all you're getting in the stream.

01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:56.320
Oh, that's weird.

01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:58.320
I mean, that's what an ASMR stream is, really.

01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.320
Just give it a few more steps.

01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:03.320
Sorry, I didn't think to do that.

01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:05.320
Don't forget to blow your nose.

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:10.320
No, I'm gonna suck up all the snot to keep the nutrients inside my body.

01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.320
I need every bit of hydration I've got

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:15.320
because I have no idea what I'm up against with these next movies.

01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:22.320
And I swear to God, if that fucker that the Weeper Popper perishes,

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:27.320
I'm gonna be, I'm not even gonna be able to eat for the rest of the day

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:29.320
out of distress of this movie.

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.320
I swear.

01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:31.320
Right.

01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:34.320
Astroni can get 92 today.

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:35.320
She'll be halfway there.

01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:37.320
Wow, please don't say that thing out loud.

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:39.320
I thought this was so much faster.

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.320
I'm ready to swap to Fletchen.

01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:43.320
We could literally do Fletchen in four hours.

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:47.320
These, these wines are taking their sweet time.

01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:48.320
Honestly.

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:51.320
Astroni, I thought the point of movie streams was to save your voice.

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:53.320
No, you need to narrate through them.

01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:56.320
No, I'm not gonna be dead silent watching it.

01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:57.320
Like, I'm gonna be like,

01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:59.320
Why are this is cool?

01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.320
Um, type thing.

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.320
I don't know if it was like a movie watch along

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.320
and you don't say nothing.

02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:07.320
I feel like that's like taking the,

02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.320
Yes.

02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.320
Um, clutch out cooking.

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:14.320
You already came this far.

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.320
I asked Gimli and Vigo to help you,

02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.320
but I think you need some head pads, honestly.

02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:20.320
I wonder if Gimli's being me.

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:21.320
I don't at all.

02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:22.320
I have no idea.

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:24.320
I like messed up my fingers so badly.

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:27.320
Uh, recording my Patreon audio.

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.320
I don't know if any of you are on my Patreon,

02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:32.320
but I use my finger to do it

02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:34.320
and I've messed up so badly.

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:37.320
I've got a big nasty scab on it right now

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:39.320
because I, I use my teeth.

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:43.320
I use my teeth so, my wee fingies for.

02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:45.320
Um, the audio was good.

02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:46.320
Like, thank you.

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.320
I was, I was jamming that thing down,

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:51.320
but to be honest with you.

02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:53.320
But the problem is I have very sharp teeth.

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.320
Like, unironically,

02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:59.320
sharp teeth.

02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:00.320
Oh, sorry.

02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:01.320
I need to vent your orgasm.

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:04.320
I forgot my microphone isn't synced for some reason,

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:07.320
so I'm doing vent your orgasm right now.

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:09.320
How are you able to hurt yourself so much?

02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:10.320
Is that a kind of challenge?

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.320
It just, it just happens.

02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:13.320
Literally, kind of,

02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:14.320
Shawnee's a biter.

02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:16.320
You want to find out?

02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.320
Sharp teeth, Shawnee, honestly.

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.320
I'm a wee cuttlefish.

02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:22.320
If you've ever seen a cuttlefish's mouth before,

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.320
or like a cephalopod's mouth,

02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.320
my teeth make sense.

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.320
I, I just, I'd say finger me,

02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:31.320
but I don't need that scab there.

02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:33.320
Honestly, you'd probably take the scab off

02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:35.320
from how hard you're puckering.

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:37.320
I'm willing to lose the tentacle.

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:40.320
I mean, you need sharp teeth to dig your fangs into humans

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.320
while we're in the water.

02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.320
The cuttlefish attack?

02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.320
I don't think cuttlefish attack, really.

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.320
I think, I think cause they're so deep seed,

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:51.320
it's really hard to even come across one naturally.

02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:54.320
Remember that time that video went viral?

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:57.320
Cause someone who was visiting Australia

02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:59.320
found a blue-ringed octopus

02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:01.320
and was like touching it and playing with it.

02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:02.320
Cause they were like,

02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:04.320
oh, what a bright and colorful octopus.

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:07.320
Not knowing it's like literally 100% kill rate

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:09.320
if it wants to end you.

02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:11.320
I remember that going viral

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:13.320
and everyone was mortified.

02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:16.320
Just as a rule with human,

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.320
with human, with nature,

02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.320
the brighter the more of a warning it is

02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.320
to leave me alone.

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:26.320
You ever wondered why chickens are so bland in color?

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:29.320
Because they can hardly do a thing to you.

02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:31.320
You want to know why tiger stripes

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:33.320
are such a warning sign?

02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:35.320
Jesus.

02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:37.320
How cute parishes did he live?

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:39.320
I can't remember if it was a chick

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:41.320
and it was a tourist

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:43.320
and she recorded a video of her playing with it

02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:45.320
in the water

02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:47.320
and it was straight up a blue-ringed octopus

02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:49.320
and it never hurt her or anything

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:51.320
but if it wanted to,

02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:53.320
so I'm going to throw up from crying so much.

02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.320
I've not even had any liquid

02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:57.320
so that burp doesn't, that burp's literally

02:02:57.320 --> 02:02:59.320
just straight up I'm going to throw up

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.320
so upset watching John Wick.

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:05.320
With nature, if you don't know what it is

02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:07.320
leave it alone, pretty much.

02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:09.320
A ten out of ten?

02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:11.320
I didn't even eat or anything for that.

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:15.320
Right, I'm going to go get some food

02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:17.320
before we go again.

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.320
I'm going to get a cup of tea so I'll be four minutes.

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:21.320
I think, I don't really need to think

02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:23.320
because I completely forgot to hydrate

02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:25.320
and I'm dehydrating via my eyeballs right now.

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:27.320
I'm so...

02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:29.320
I will hydrate when we get back.

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:31.320
Please, I'm going to say the S-word.

02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:33.320
No you're not.

02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:35.320
No you're not.

02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:37.320
You want to know why cairns die their hair pink?

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:39.320
It's a warning so stop!

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:41.320
You can't say that stuff out loud

02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:43.320
but why is it so true though?

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:45.320
Wait, hold on a minute.

02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:47.320
Are you allowed to say it out loud

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:49.320
if it's the truth?

02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:51.320
Hmm?

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.320
Now I don't mean to be a weirdo

02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:55.320
but I'm allowed to say it out loud

02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:57.320
if it's the truth question mark.

02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:59.320
Yes? No?

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:01.320
I've got yes and a no.

02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:03.320
Hmm.

02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:05.320
Hmm.

02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:07.320
Sus, sus, I don't know.

02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.320
No, there's some truths that you can't speak.

02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.320
Okay.

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.320
Then we will do the...

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:15.320
we will practice the non-speaking.

02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.320
How about that?

02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.320
Always speak your truth even if the world ain't right.

02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:21.320
And they hated Strone, for she spoke the truth.

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.320
I did that meme real quick.

02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:27.320
Honestly.

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:29.320
I don't know if I should say it

02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.320
but we're already here.

02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:33.320
I remember watching the YouTube channel

02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.320
a couple of years back

02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:37.320
and it was like freak out videos

02:04:37.320 --> 02:04:39.320
of people with multi-coloured hair.

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:41.320
And the channel got taken down for hate

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.320
but it was just compilations

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:45.320
of what people had produced.

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:47.320
And someone was like in an atrium

02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:49.320
swinging their arms back and forth

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:51.320
and it looks like they were about to fly away

02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:53.320
but she was like screaming back and forth

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:55.320
with her arms. I just remember that.

02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:57.320
Don't censor yourself, my little seaweed assassin!

02:04:57.320 --> 02:04:59.320
Oh my god!

02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:01.320
Assassin!

02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:03.320
That would be my name if I was a wee assassin.

02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:05.320
I'd be no... call me C.

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:07.320
Seaweed.

02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:09.320
Why do they call you Seaweed? Oh, weed

02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.320
because I'm a bit shite, to be honest.

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:13.320
I'm not the best. And then C because

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:15.320
well, the enemy kind of sees me

02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:17.320
because I'm not very good at stealth as well.

02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.320
Yeah, call me Seaweed, the assassin.

02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:23.320
The truth is

02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.320
Black Rock can't stop us now.

02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:27.320
No, we're learning.

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.320
We're getting the information.

02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:31.320
A danger to us even.

02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:33.320
I was snotting the back of my nose.

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:35.320
You want to hear it?

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:37.320
Ew.

02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:39.320
Open your mouth. That's disgusting.

02:05:39.320 --> 02:05:41.320
I'm sorry. I just filtered one person

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.320
by doing that. I know that for a fact.

02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:45.320
Okay.

02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.320
I'm going to go make a cup of tea

02:05:47.320 --> 02:05:49.320
and get some food. I highly

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:51.320
give it the hot toe.

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:53.320
Oh my god!

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.320
Sick GF

02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.320
gives you a...

02:05:57.320 --> 02:05:59.320
Instead of doing like her spit, she goes

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:01.320
like that

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.320
and then

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:05.320
and it's all snot.

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:07.320
That's disgusting. See, this is why

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:09.320
you can't let me come up with the ideas

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:11.320
and execute them because I end up

02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:13.320
being such disgusting things.

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:15.320
Literally, I come out with stuff that no one

02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.320
would ever think.

02:06:17.320 --> 02:06:19.320
I legit gagged. I'm so sorry.

02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:21.320
Disgustingly hot.

02:06:21.320 --> 02:06:23.320
I'm so sorry. This is why you can't let

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:25.320
me like execute things I want

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:27.320
to do.

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:29.320
Try not to be disgusting challenge coming

02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:31.320
up with my... No!

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:33.320
Try and come up with one normal ASMR idea

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.320
challenge. Literally, my first opening

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:37.320
line on my most recent ASMR was

02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:39.320
the STD clinics down there.

02:06:39.320 --> 02:06:41.320
Right, okay.

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:43.320
Be normal for five seconds challenge,

02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:45.320
Ronnie. Let's go.

02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.320
Right, I will be a moment.

02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:49.320
I'll just give me a second to tingle.

02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:51.320
I highly recommend everyone, please get

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:53.320
up, please get a drink, please tingle

02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:55.320
or tingle, tingle

02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:57.320
or please

02:06:57.320 --> 02:06:59.320
at least stretch your legs so

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:01.320
you don't become absolutely clogged

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.320
like me. I think I'm already baking

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:05.320
a two day loaf of bread at the moment

02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:07.320
and it's not looking good.

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:09.320
I'm going to have to start

02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:11.320
sending

02:07:11.320 --> 02:07:13.320
reeflings up there because something's not going

02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.320
on. Where's Kaka and on when you need

02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:17.320
him? He's gone far

02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:19.320
toilet bowl and on is gone

02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:21.320
when you needed him most.

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:25.320
Yeah, that first line maybe tickle.

02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:27.320
Is this the movie marathon stream?

02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:29.320
Yes, so we're about to do

02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:31.320
chapter two.

02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:33.320
We're going to start it after I go get a wee break

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:35.320
by a break.

02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:37.320
I mean literally just get food to nourish

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:39.320
my body because I didn't eat

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.320
before stream because I don't eat before

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.320
stream because I wake up and then I stream

02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:45.320
and then I eat.

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:47.320
So I'll be literally a minute

02:07:47.320 --> 02:07:49.320
and by a minute I mean four minutes

02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.320
because the kettle takes four minutes to fricking boil. I don't know why it takes so long.

02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:53.320
I feel like my British kettle was way better

02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:55.320
but my Aussie kettle

02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:57.320
hooked to it.

02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:07.320
Thanks for watching.

02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:37.320
You

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:07.320
you

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:37.320
you

02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:45.320
Are you squidding me right now?

02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.320
you

02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:37.320
you

02:10:49.320 --> 02:10:51.320
Are you squidding me right now?

02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:07.320
Are you squidding me right now?

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.320
Are you squidding me right now?

02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.320
Are you squidding me right now?

02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:51.320
Donating just to hear her voice again

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.320
underscore cry.

02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:57.320
Are you squidding me right now?

02:12:05.320 --> 02:12:07.380
you

02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:37.380
you

02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:07.380
you

02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.380
you

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:33.660
okay now that's all out of my head I know I've muted the game sound for you

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:44.280
guys that's so loud in my head it's a it's like oh my goodness they done I

02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:10.760
This man can't have shit!

02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:14.760
Oh my god, at least he's got his pupper!

02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:17.760
Holy fuck, he's becoming a monk!

02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:20.760
He's letting go of everything he loves, fuck.

02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:23.760
I'm trying to give it a positive twist so I don't cry.

02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:25.760
He just wants to practice being a monk, okay?

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:27.760
And he's getting rid of everything he loves,

02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:31.760
because that's the monk way or something like that, I can't remember.

02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:47.760
Tell me?

02:41:47.760 --> 02:41:53.760
I can't answer him.

02:41:53.760 --> 02:41:59.760
Oh my god!

02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:05.760
He knows he's working.

02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:10.760
Oh look at the dog!

02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:12.760
Okay, I finished my thingy.

02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:13.760
Jimmy's a goat, literally.

02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:22.760
Jimmy's like, alright, alright, alright.

02:42:22.760 --> 02:42:27.760
Oh we went to the continent, oh!

02:42:27.760 --> 02:42:30.760
Oh my god, that dog is constantly looking for his cue.

02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:31.760
He's so cute!

02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:38.760
Look at it looking at his hand for a treaty when he does the right cue.

02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:41.760
Don't say no pets, I'll cry.

02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:55.760
Don't say no pets, I'll actually greet.

02:42:55.760 --> 02:42:58.760
Now the dog can come into the conversation.

02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:05.760
It needs to know too why it's who's just got blown to smithereens legs.

02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:11.760
Okay, what's this?

02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:17.760
The cement didn't even have time to dry before people started picking fight skin, literally!

02:43:17.760 --> 02:43:32.760
Okay, what's going on here?

02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:35.760
Good afternoon, hotel owner, Mr. Winston.

02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:37.760
Big Winnie-Billy.

02:43:37.760 --> 02:43:41.760
Winston!

02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:44.760
I'm having my tea, please remember to hydrate, Riflin.

02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:47.760
If you cried like me as well during the scene a little.

02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:49.760
I didn't cry, I may have cried a little.

02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:51.760
But I didn't cry though, because I'm a big girl.

02:44:15.760 --> 02:44:21.760
Dad's giving us some smack talk.

02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:23.760
Sorry dad, we messed up.

02:44:44.760 --> 02:45:13.760
But he was a different person back then, he's not the same big Johnny boy, he's different.

02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:25.760
I'm a big girl, you said later me or Asa.

02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:32.760
Okay, daddy's telling us what's up.

02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:37.760
Okay, our options have been laid out before us.

02:45:37.760 --> 02:45:44.760
What a smart pupper, honestly.

02:45:44.760 --> 02:45:50.760
Can you make an exception?

02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:53.760
Thank you! Yes, yes, yes, please!

02:45:53.760 --> 02:46:03.760
I trust him in your hands wholeheartedly.

02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:07.760
Aw, I trust him with the wee pupper.

02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:10.760
I'll be back soon, don't worry.

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:24.760
I need to go on a badass mission against the Italians.

02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:28.760
That's right, I'm just going to say random Italian phrases I picked up from Assassin's Creed.

02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:30.760
What are you going to do about it?

02:46:30.760 --> 02:46:33.760
Oh, it's the enemy lady.

02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:36.760
Don't think, oh my god, yeah, yeah, you're feeling those pecs.

02:46:36.760 --> 02:46:39.760
That's right, you like my pecs, don't you? Yes.

02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:44.760
Actually, your hair's short, this might indicate a different kind of interest.

02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:47.760
Hey, what team do you bat for? What's going on here?

02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:50.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, a little sheebie move right there, what the heck?

02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:52.760
That was my back door. Back off! Back off!

02:46:52.760 --> 02:46:54.760
You foul beast.

02:46:54.760 --> 02:46:56.760
I have a wife, you know.

02:46:56.760 --> 02:47:11.760
She's in either, but I'm going to her very soon.

02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:20.760
Fucking miscoosie, that was my arsehole chick.

02:47:20.760 --> 02:47:35.760
Accidental prostate exam whilst you're getting patted down for guns, like, or eight of them.

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:46.760
And yet you did.

02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:59.760
Yeah, probably.

02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:11.760
With a fucking pencil.

02:48:11.760 --> 02:48:15.760
Ooh.

02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:35.760
I should dance, huh?

02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:48.760
Who is it?

02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:57.760
He wants in.

02:48:57.760 --> 02:49:03.760
Never for the Italian.

02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:32.760
Oh, well, I mean, isn't there a reason that the father thought?

02:49:33.760 --> 02:49:48.760
Oh, she in Roma? I'm getting flashbacks to Assassin's Creed.

02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:58.760
To say ghost in French, you say Lufantum, repeat.

02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.760
I'll correct, say a Borgia, a big chisory Borgia going on here.

02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:12.760
Oh, she's in Rome. I love my sister, but I can't kill her.

02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:17.760
Everyone's in their own world.

02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:20.760
Everyone's doing their own thing, got their own problems, that was a good shot.

02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:28.760
I like that train shot, or subway cart shot.

02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:57.760
Mm-hmm.

02:50:57.760 --> 02:51:06.760
Man, he really likes his Balenciaga, like, he's like, no, so I can't be the boogeyman if I've no got my nice and tidy wee shirt and shoes on.

02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:10.760
He's got, look, he's got a method, all I'm saying, he's got a method and it works.

02:51:10.760 --> 02:51:23.760
Oh, okay, I take it back. I apologize. That was kind of really obvious, it wasn't just clothes, I'm sorry, I'm dumb.

02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:30.760
He doesn't want to do it, he's angry. I got scared there.

02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:35.760
It's because he's angry, he doesn't want to do it.

02:51:35.760 --> 02:51:38.760
That actually don't scare me, I'm gonna lie like this.

02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:42.760
Rome, it was not built in a day.

02:51:42.760 --> 02:51:46.760
Alright, what's the first bank we blow up?

02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:51.760
The people cannot owe debts if there's no one to owe the debts to.

02:51:51.760 --> 02:51:57.760
And remember, the banks are just entities at the end of the day, they are concepts.

02:51:57.760 --> 02:52:02.760
Is that her?

02:52:02.760 --> 02:52:06.760
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that out loud, I'm getting a bit too carried away.

02:52:06.760 --> 02:52:15.760
I'm sorry, John Wick's going through me, I shouldn't have said that.

02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:33.760
So is this...

02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:42.760
Of course it seems Julius, they didn't even try.

02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:50.760
The YouTube transcript's probably going wild, true.

02:52:50.760 --> 02:53:04.760
This stream is going to be a limited ads, I just know it.

02:53:04.760 --> 02:53:10.760
No. No. No.

02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:18.760
No, no, we're not here for the Pope.

02:53:18.760 --> 02:53:32.760
Why would there be a head on the Pope?

02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:34.760
Thank you.

02:53:34.760 --> 02:53:36.760
I wonder what's inside the room.

02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:40.760
Is there gonna be pew-pews?

02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:44.760
God, everyone freaking knows us, we're so popular, Reflins.

02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:47.760
How are you so popular?

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:09.760
You miss the word why? I mean, the Pope should be on the...

02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:18.760
I mean, if there's religious tax exemptions, why don't the people get it?

02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:20.760
Curious.

02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:22.760
Do we not believe in ourselves?

02:54:22.760 --> 02:54:28.760
Do we not have hope in ourselves? Do we not have souls?

02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:33.760
You.

02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:46.760
Thank you very much, Lady, for leading us to the...

02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:55.760
How does he speak so many lingos?

02:54:55.760 --> 02:55:14.760
Curious.

02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:19.760
I need to do a suit measuring ASMR for you guys.

02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:25.760
When I get down to the area, you already know I'm going to be hovering.

02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:40.760
Oh, inseam, that's what it's called, inseam on the suit.

02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:43.760
I need to wear wear.

02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:54.760
All the economy and monetary traffic behind that in Italy is another way to talk about the mafia.

02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:59.760
11.5 inches, how's anyone supposed to fit that?

02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:02.760
Teasing.

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:21.760
A badass sweatshop lady, hello?

02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:26.760
She's a trained assassin?

02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:36.760
Yeah.

02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:40.760
Manila and foils.

02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:47.760
Oh, I've not seen that.

02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:50.760
Am I?

02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:55.760
My hands get wet at the end of an evening too.

02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:58.760
It's just too easy, I'm sorry.

02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:01.760
Oh my god, it's Mercy Modest!

02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:14.760
I hate myself, I hate myself, why did I come up with that?

02:57:14.760 --> 02:57:17.760
Next, so we fondle abysm.

02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:20.760
Late epic joke.

02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:23.760
Oh, sorry, my wee chair clip just came off.

02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:29.760
Anyone else? Happy hunting.

02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:34.760
He has a bit more tact with it.

02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:41.760
I might need to burp a little.

02:57:41.760 --> 02:57:45.760
Fortune's Fortuna means good luck or something.

02:57:45.760 --> 02:57:49.760
Fortuna, bonafortuna is good luck.

02:57:49.760 --> 02:57:52.760
What does this back tattoo say?

02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:54.760
Someone googled it for me right now.

02:57:54.760 --> 02:57:59.760
What does John Wicks tattoo say?

02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:03.760
Type that in right now, go.

02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:06.760
Something fortune, fortune favors the bold.

02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:09.760
I knew it was fortune.

02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:11.760
I knew it, I knew it.

02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:14.760
Fortuna, Fortuna means fortune.

02:58:14.760 --> 02:58:17.760
Oh, it's Latin?

02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:20.760
Oops.

02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:24.760
I remember my mum said she took Latin in school and I was like, ain't that lingo dead?

02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:31.760
And I was like, well, dead spoken but or something, I don't know.

02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:36.760
Oh look, he's gone up the cobblestones where the horsies used to clop-a-dee-clop up.

02:58:37.760 --> 02:58:45.760
Oh, did you hear they found a new room in Pompey with blue wallpaper paint?

02:58:45.760 --> 02:58:47.760
Like blue paint on the walls.

02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:49.760
I'm so sorry if that's really boring.

02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:55.760
But Pompey is the, I don't know, Ashen site of the volcanic in Italy

02:58:55.760 --> 02:58:58.760
and they discovered a new room that used blue wall paint

02:58:58.760 --> 02:59:00.760
and there's something about the paint that's really specific

02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:04.760
because it got phased out in culture or something

02:59:04.760 --> 02:59:10.760
and they don't know what the connection is with Italy having access to this blue paint.

02:59:10.760 --> 02:59:12.760
Whoa, AC again!

02:59:12.760 --> 02:59:16.760
Come on, AC, have you got the blue going for her?

02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:23.760
Oh, come on, AC, take it away.

02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:26.760
You look nothing like AC but it's close enough, close enough.

02:59:27.760 --> 02:59:33.760
Okay, maybe AC is on the DJ stand and not the singer.

02:59:33.760 --> 02:59:34.760
Because...

02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:39.760
Il Colosseum.

02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:46.760
Oh?

02:59:47.760 --> 02:59:50.760
Target acquired.

02:59:50.760 --> 02:59:52.760
Target acquired.

02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:55.760
And the wise words of...

03:00:50.760 --> 03:01:03.760
Look how low the bass player's, the guitar guy's legs were.

03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:06.760
He was like squatting playing the guitar there.

03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:08.760
I'm so sorry.

03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:13.760
Italy taking a little, little ducky.

03:01:20.760 --> 03:01:45.760
That's a man, so that ain't AC on it.

03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:49.760
Look how low his wee legs are getting, sorry.

03:01:49.760 --> 03:01:51.760
It looks very strange.

03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:55.760
I think maybe because he's wearing skinny jeans, he looks like a little stick.

03:01:56.760 --> 03:01:59.760
He looks like a praying mantis playing the guitar.

03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:03.760
Where's wee legs going then?

03:02:05.760 --> 03:02:06.760
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:08.760
I think I'm delirious from all the crying earlier.

03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:12.760
He's literally going to end up then just playing the guitar.

03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:13.760
I'm so sorry.

03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:15.760
Honestly.

03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:26.760
I need a fur.

03:02:31.760 --> 03:02:33.760
I almost popped a blood vessel.

03:02:34.760 --> 03:02:36.760
Try and get that one out.

03:02:42.760 --> 03:02:51.760
The praying mantis confirmed absolutely not.

03:02:51.760 --> 03:03:12.760
Oh, cutthroat business women.

03:03:12.760 --> 03:03:14.760
Maven Black Briar, clearly.

03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:17.760
That's a Skyrim reference for you, if you want.

03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:30.760
Oh, I'll refresh in your makeup all right.

03:03:30.760 --> 03:03:31.760
Glup, glup, glup.

03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:33.760
Oh, wait.

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:35.760
What is this little paper?

03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:37.760
What is this little paper?

03:04:00.760 --> 03:04:02.760
Are we in here with her?

03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:07.760
No.

03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:10.760
That was so cool.

03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:32.760
I have a lot of friends.

03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:35.760
Oh, no.

03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:46.760
I like the way they've done subtitles.

03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:50.760
Your brother.

03:04:51.760 --> 03:04:53.760
You have to tell her who.

03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:56.760
Your brother.

03:05:01.760 --> 03:05:04.760
She knows, she knows, she knows, she knows.

03:05:06.760 --> 03:05:09.760
Now for a seat at this table.

03:05:09.760 --> 03:05:11.760
My way.

03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:13.760
My way.

03:05:36.760 --> 03:05:38.760
Yes.

03:05:39.760 --> 03:05:43.760
She understands, no.

03:05:52.760 --> 03:05:55.760
She's not even mad, like she understands.

03:06:09.760 --> 03:06:11.760
We can't win.

03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:20.760
She understands, she's not going to fight or anything.

03:06:20.760 --> 03:06:22.760
She accepts it with grace.

03:06:24.760 --> 03:06:26.760
Oh, my lady.

03:06:26.760 --> 03:06:28.760
My lady.

03:06:36.760 --> 03:06:38.760
My lady.

03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:40.760
My lady.

03:06:40.760 --> 03:06:42.760
My lady, I didn't even see that.

03:06:42.760 --> 03:06:44.760
My lady.

03:06:44.760 --> 03:06:46.760
Wait, I don't understand.

03:06:46.760 --> 03:06:48.760
Is she like poison up her butt or something?

03:06:48.760 --> 03:06:50.760
Is she just, I think she's accepting it.

03:06:57.760 --> 03:06:59.760
Well, considering he's maintaining eye contact,

03:06:59.760 --> 03:07:01.760
I only look at my wife.

03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:05.760
Oh, her hair clip was a weapon.

03:07:05.760 --> 03:07:07.760
But she chose not to.

03:07:10.760 --> 03:07:13.760
Oh, my God, she's actually accepting it.

03:07:21.760 --> 03:07:23.760
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:07:23.760 --> 03:07:25.760
Out on her own terms.

03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:27.760
Oh, please.

03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:29.760
Oh, please.

03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:33.760
It doesn't have to be this way.

03:07:37.760 --> 03:07:39.760
She doesn't want exploded.

03:07:42.760 --> 03:07:44.760
Oh, my God, that visual is so cool.

03:07:46.760 --> 03:07:48.760
No, darling.

03:07:54.760 --> 03:07:56.760
Oh, no.

03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:02.760
Oh, that symbolism, though.

03:08:02.760 --> 03:08:04.760
Look at the way her feet crossed over.

03:08:13.760 --> 03:08:16.760
Please don't think I didn't catch that symbolism in her pose.

03:08:16.760 --> 03:08:19.760
Please don't think I didn't catch that symbolism in her pose.

03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:25.760
No.

03:08:29.760 --> 03:08:32.760
Oh, that feels so terrible.

03:08:37.760 --> 03:08:39.760
It was your brother.

03:08:39.760 --> 03:08:41.760
Oh.

03:08:46.760 --> 03:08:48.760
It was your brother.

03:08:52.760 --> 03:08:54.760
We're here for you.

03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:56.760
Oh, I feel so sad for her.

03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:58.760
No.

03:09:02.760 --> 03:09:04.760
Oh.

03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:11.760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:09:11.760 --> 03:09:13.760
Wait.

03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:17.760
Oh, she asked to go pretty.

03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:22.760
John, she asked to go pretty.

03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:24.760
That's why she did that.

03:09:24.760 --> 03:09:27.760
She didn't want a big blast on her freaking cranium.

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:34.760
For fuck's sake, men don't understand.

03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:39.760
She wanted to be a pretty corpse on her own terms for fuck's sake, John.

03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:43.760
AC, you better turn them tunes down, I'm region.

03:09:45.760 --> 03:09:47.760
John, you dance.

03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:49.760
Oh, no.

03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:52.760
We got clocked.

03:09:52.760 --> 03:09:54.760
Ah.

03:10:07.760 --> 03:10:10.760
Oh, she didn't know.

03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:12.760
Good night.

03:10:23.760 --> 03:10:25.760
Oh.

03:10:41.760 --> 03:10:44.760
She did get to go out on her own way.

03:10:44.760 --> 03:10:47.760
I know John has to confirm the job, but...

03:10:48.760 --> 03:10:50.760
Oh, I guess team is of the essence.

03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:52.760
You can't be messing around.

03:10:53.760 --> 03:10:55.760
Fucking AC, get it.

03:11:01.760 --> 03:11:03.760
On stage?

03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:06.760
Wait, they think it's a plot?

03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:08.760
Like a...

03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:11.760
Okay, okay.

03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:15.760
Uh, high civilian casually, right?

03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:43.760
What?

03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:51.760
What?

03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:02.760
A good blood detail on the kills.

03:12:12.760 --> 03:12:14.760
Yeah.

03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:21.760
Oh, she's gone.

03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:27.760
Damn, they must have had to edit the Krammer crew out of that mirror shot.

03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:29.760
I just...

03:12:36.760 --> 03:12:38.760
Oh, it hurts.

03:12:38.760 --> 03:12:41.760
A bullet just dropped off of him, that's actually such a good detail.

03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:44.760
I wouldn't even consider that, but yeah, if a bullet gets stopped,

03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:47.760
it could just be attached to the core of him.

03:12:55.760 --> 03:12:57.760
I think we just got the patchy.

03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:01.760
I'll actually just pop him off like a bit ASMR,

03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:06.760
but like bullets like popping off of a bullet thing.

03:13:08.760 --> 03:13:12.760
Well, I can't even see shit, I don't even know about you, lads, but...

03:13:12.760 --> 03:13:15.760
Fuck it, I'll need my glicks on for this scene.

03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:17.760
It's a bit cloudy.

03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:21.760
It's the lady.

03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:34.760
He double-crossed us?

03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:42.760
We were double-crossed?

03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:49.760
Well, now we can't let him take the throne at all.

03:13:49.760 --> 03:13:52.760
He is not getting a seat at the high table.

03:13:52.760 --> 03:13:56.760
If anything, I'll take over for the Italians myself.

03:13:56.760 --> 03:13:59.760
Uh, first business, um...

03:13:59.760 --> 03:14:02.760
Uh, first business, um...

03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:05.760
First business, um...

03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:08.760
First business, um...

03:14:08.760 --> 03:14:12.760
I don't know, I don't know what business.

03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:15.760
More Italian vichaburus, yay!

03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:17.760
First business.

03:14:17.760 --> 03:14:20.760
We bring anime to Italy.

03:14:23.760 --> 03:14:27.760
All I'm saying is, hear me out, lollipop, pope.

03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:30.760
Make it a meatball.

03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:33.760
A lollipop, honestly.

03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:36.760
That's actually really good, I wish I could do that.

03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:39.760
Mmm, that's not crillage.

03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:45.760
Well, look at the way that mag went flying.

03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:50.760
U stationed, south-east.

03:14:50.760 --> 03:14:53.760
Well, we're taking a hammer-in.

03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:03.760
U don't know what to do.

03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:11.760
Well, we'll see you there later.

03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:24.200
come on reflins come on reflins you can do it

03:15:24.200 --> 03:15:48.200
yeah I'm gonna have to admit fidgety ammo reload not a fan

03:15:48.200 --> 03:15:56.800
too precise with the amount of adrenaline that would go through you too

03:15:56.800 --> 03:16:03.960
precise for a reload although John Wick's probably used it now

03:16:08.800 --> 03:16:15.960
brutal a brutal

03:16:18.200 --> 03:16:45.760
you are not winning against a showy

03:16:45.760 --> 03:17:04.520
the spread on the pellets can be just so just too much John probably forgets how

03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:07.800
to reload when he doesn't have adrenaline literally start missing in

03:17:07.800 --> 03:17:11.280
stuff he's like hey where's that where's the shaky hands he's already used to the

03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:14.560
shake

03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:22.440

03:37:05.880 --> 03:37:08.000

It all went well. How do we feel about john wick so far? I am blown away by the series

04:25:58.040 --> 04:26:02.840
I am very nervous for what's about to occur in movie number three

04:26:03.640 --> 04:26:06.920
So very quick recap if I understand correctly

04:26:07.880 --> 04:26:16.040
We have been excommunicadoed and now all assassins worldwide have a 14 million

04:26:16.920 --> 04:26:18.920
us dollar

04:26:18.920 --> 04:26:20.040
bounty

04:26:20.040 --> 04:26:26.280
On the head of beloved john wick or it also known as refling also known as me because

04:26:26.760 --> 04:26:30.440
I insert us into movies because I think it's fun to be like are we gonna get do it?

04:26:30.440 --> 04:26:33.640
Come on you can do it like I like doing that. I don't know if that's just me

04:26:34.040 --> 04:26:36.040
but yeah

04:26:36.040 --> 04:26:40.120
This is one of the many reasons why I love you because you explain in such detail

04:26:40.760 --> 04:26:47.320
Your horrendous fight in the why is it called a restroom if I'm fighting for my life in here?

04:26:49.800 --> 04:26:51.480
Okay

04:26:51.480 --> 04:26:53.320
As everyone got john

Three opened up also. Congrats. If your name's john john john johnny jonathan john

04:26:59.960 --> 04:27:03.640
I'm scaring the absolute crap out of the one person that's called john right now

04:27:04.120 --> 04:27:06.120
Apologies, um

04:27:06.920 --> 04:27:13.080
Or if your name's winston, but I think you would be an og san if you're a winston because that's kind of like a later name big johnny boy

04:27:14.520 --> 04:27:16.920
Um, I have to go to sleep now. Thank you so much for the stream

04:27:17.000 --> 04:27:24.040
No, thank you so much for the stream because I just get to fucking goof off and edge myself and edgeville with wines

04:27:24.600 --> 04:27:26.760
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that part out loud

04:27:27.160 --> 04:27:28.760
um

04:27:28.760 --> 04:27:36.200
I'm starting to lose the filter slightly. I I think because of the emotional turmoil that was the first, um

04:27:37.320 --> 04:27:42.520
Movie I have to admit. I did not recall any of those sad scenes

04:27:43.400 --> 04:27:44.520
and

04:27:44.520 --> 04:27:51.160
I only cried a little bit in the second one. So surely by the third movie. I'm not shedding any tears

04:27:51.720 --> 04:27:56.520
Surely there shall be no tears shed. I'm a big girl. Okay

04:27:57.480 --> 04:28:02.920
Um, I have two hours 10 minutes and 46 seconds. You can actually see it up top

04:28:03.000 --> 04:28:05.800
It's loaded one second in how cheeky of this

04:28:06.440 --> 04:28:08.680
No tears here. Maybe hopefully not

04:28:10.920 --> 04:28:12.920
Um

04:28:13.320 --> 04:28:16.920
Right, are we all ready? Do we have movie number three opened up?

04:28:18.840 --> 04:28:20.520
Okay

04:28:20.520 --> 04:28:26.280

Let us see what movie number three has in store for us

04:28:36.280 --> 04:28:41.880
Now that we have a 14 million bounty on our head. I don't even know what that would be in today's money

04:28:42.280 --> 04:28:46.040
I feel like it would probably have inflated to like 21 million at least

04:28:46.280 --> 04:28:48.280
Um

04:28:48.440 --> 04:28:50.440

05:19:30.680 --> 05:19:32.680
You

05:19:36.760 --> 05:19:40.480
Wait, who's he he's in Game of Thrones as well

05:19:46.920 --> 05:19:48.920
Be nice to the popper

05:20:01.040 --> 05:20:03.040
You

05:20:17.680 --> 05:20:23.000
To train these dogs I imagine they worked a lot mmm a lot accused for the dogs I

05:20:23.840 --> 05:20:25.840
I

05:20:26.160 --> 05:20:33.400
Wonder if it's hard to get a dog not to look at the camera because babies and like toddlers and like child actors always

05:20:33.400 --> 05:20:35.400
Look at the camera. They have to tell him to knock it off

05:20:53.000 --> 05:20:55.000
You

05:21:10.440 --> 05:21:12.440
Uh-huh

05:21:23.840 --> 05:21:25.840
Uh-huh

05:21:28.480 --> 05:21:30.480
Yeah

05:21:36.240 --> 05:21:38.240
Me are you sure

05:21:44.720 --> 05:21:46.720
No

05:21:53.000 --> 05:21:55.000
I

05:22:05.080 --> 05:22:07.080
Have a little sniff

05:22:16.880 --> 05:22:18.880
The elder

05:22:23.640 --> 05:22:30.760
I'm sweating I'm getting nervous. I don't like this

05:22:35.400 --> 05:22:37.400
No

05:22:49.600 --> 05:22:51.600
Yeah

05:22:54.000 --> 05:22:56.000
I

05:22:57.920 --> 05:23:02.280
Ryan's bill you can see a the constellation from Scotland

05:23:09.120 --> 05:23:11.120
Is that a joke oh

05:23:12.840 --> 05:23:16.720
Yeah, we've been trolled or are we actually supposed to shovel off into the desert

05:23:23.000 --> 05:23:25.000
You

05:23:44.240 --> 05:23:46.240
No, not her dog

05:23:47.560 --> 05:23:49.560
No

05:23:53.240 --> 05:23:55.240
Oh

05:24:13.080 --> 05:24:15.080
Oh

05:24:23.000 --> 05:24:23.840
Oh.

05:24:31.300 --> 05:24:32.140
Missed.

05:24:36.080 --> 05:24:36.920
Fuck!

05:24:39.440 --> 05:24:41.480
Deserved, deserved.

05:24:41.480 --> 05:25:01.480
Yes! Yes! Get him! Get him! Take that foreskin! Arrgh!

05:25:11.980 --> 05:25:14.980
Dog's having fun playing tug of war with this.

05:25:36.860 --> 05:25:39.100
I hope he learned his lesson.

05:25:40.100 --> 05:25:45.100
Okay, John, Wick and Sophia on the exact same page.

05:25:50.100 --> 05:25:54.100
I'm sure when John was like, don't, he meant, yeah, go ahead.

05:25:54.100 --> 05:25:55.100
Go ahead.

05:26:06.100 --> 05:26:08.100
Oh! Kidding shot!

05:26:13.100 --> 05:26:18.100
That dog mustn't have any hearing from the how loud those shots are, but...

05:26:20.100 --> 05:26:21.100
Let's go, let's go.

05:26:24.100 --> 05:26:25.100
Okay.

05:26:43.100 --> 05:26:44.100
She's accurate.

05:26:45.100 --> 05:26:47.100
Unconservative of the bullets.

05:26:48.100 --> 05:26:51.100
I think he's gone after them. I think the fourth bullet and I'm really...

05:26:52.100 --> 05:26:55.100
Whoa, you need to reload, darling. What's going on?

05:26:57.100 --> 05:26:59.100
Nah, right, nah. Hold on.

05:27:00.100 --> 05:27:03.100
You do not have that many bullets in the chamber.

05:27:04.100 --> 05:27:05.100
Hold on, John Wick 1.

05:27:06.100 --> 05:27:07.100
Writers?

05:27:22.100 --> 05:27:23.100
Oh, shit.

05:27:24.100 --> 05:27:25.100
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

05:27:51.100 --> 05:27:52.100
Hey!

05:27:59.100 --> 05:28:00.100
Hey!

05:28:02.100 --> 05:28:03.100
Hey!

05:28:05.100 --> 05:28:06.100
The drill!

05:28:14.100 --> 05:28:15.100
Whoa!

05:28:16.100 --> 05:28:18.100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:28:21.100 --> 05:28:22.100
Okay.

05:28:34.100 --> 05:28:40.100
She really trained them to go for the mints and turkeys on a man.

05:28:47.100 --> 05:28:50.100
Holy crap, how many, bro?

05:28:51.100 --> 05:28:54.100
Where's John Wick's KD? Like, be so for real.

05:28:57.100 --> 05:28:59.100
Thousands, tens of thousands?

05:29:03.100 --> 05:29:04.100
Yeah, get him!

05:29:22.100 --> 05:29:25.100
Given that he hasn't died, infinite.

05:29:29.100 --> 05:29:31.100
This feels like a time crisis.

05:29:39.100 --> 05:29:43.100
Okay, okay, okay, did... did...

05:29:43.100 --> 05:29:48.100
Poppers! Poppers!

05:30:13.100 --> 05:30:15.100
We need a puppy

05:30:23.100 --> 05:30:30.140
Okay, I don't I don't see GI but I've seen like those dogs. I get trained to do that like jump crazy. Hey

05:30:35.500 --> 05:30:37.500
Oh

05:30:43.100 --> 05:30:49.420
I pump can you did fantastic

05:31:07.180 --> 05:31:09.580
Oh my god, these dogs are crazy

05:31:14.060 --> 05:31:16.060
I

05:31:22.940 --> 05:31:27.020
Think that dog got confused it's supposed to go in the same window as the other one, but it's fine. It's fine

05:31:29.020 --> 05:31:32.700
Even up a tree can't save you from your boss getting bitten off honestly

05:31:34.300 --> 05:31:38.700
Right, so are we unironically going on a constellation quest?

05:31:43.180 --> 05:31:52.940
You tell me the elder of the high table is sitting about in the desert

05:31:57.580 --> 05:32:02.540
Just hanging around the back satellite surveillance can't even find them

05:32:05.500 --> 05:32:07.500
There you go poppers

05:32:13.260 --> 05:32:15.260
Oh

05:32:26.780 --> 05:32:28.780
Are you sure about that?

05:32:30.700 --> 05:32:34.940
Oh, what bird tonight is tetanus, sorry the other one

05:32:37.180 --> 05:32:39.180
I didn't see any Annie back on that point

05:32:39.180 --> 05:32:41.180
I

05:32:42.700 --> 05:32:46.700
Know the three fly on his suit I saw that don't think I didn't notice the fly on his suit

05:32:48.220 --> 05:32:51.180
It's sucking up all them the moisture off of you every fun

05:33:02.220 --> 05:33:04.220
Really

05:33:10.060 --> 05:33:12.060
You

05:33:15.020 --> 05:33:17.020
Really

05:33:29.180 --> 05:33:34.060
Really did we not just save her daughter and hide her and keep her safe

05:33:34.860 --> 05:33:36.860
Oh

05:33:37.420 --> 05:33:40.620
My god, we actually are just going on a random desert quest

05:33:41.260 --> 05:33:43.820
My brother you are going to perish so quickly

05:33:44.940 --> 05:33:50.460
And no drinking your pee in the desert doesn't work. You're filtering out urea, which is the

05:33:51.180 --> 05:33:54.940
Like basically the straight poison your body can't handle it is why it's a byproduct

05:33:55.980 --> 05:33:57.980
so no

05:33:58.380 --> 05:34:00.380
Better drink your own

05:34:00.700 --> 05:34:02.700
doesn't work

05:34:02.700 --> 05:34:06.060
And at night in the desert I get sub below temperatures

05:34:10.620 --> 05:34:14.540
Oh my god, there's gonna be a sandworm for dune coming out of nowhere in a minute

05:34:21.260 --> 05:34:23.260
Okay

05:34:23.980 --> 05:34:27.500
Well, this is where the quest ends clearly because we've just perished

05:34:29.260 --> 05:34:31.260
Mummy can you do that too? Oh

05:34:32.780 --> 05:34:35.180
You may spit water out and make you drink it

05:34:37.500 --> 05:34:39.500
Seven days

05:34:43.500 --> 05:34:45.500
No, no, no

05:34:45.980 --> 05:34:47.340
No

05:34:47.340 --> 05:34:53.340
Oh my god, right saws, but the yakuza is taking the mic. This is a soup kitchen

05:34:55.100 --> 05:35:00.380
We feed the homeless fur just a human right shock and behavior honestly

05:35:03.340 --> 05:35:10.540
Wait, is he is he gonna die? No, no, no, no, no, no wait, is Winston gonna die as well?

05:35:13.260 --> 05:35:15.260
Oh my gosh

05:35:18.940 --> 05:35:20.940
Oh, this cannot be

05:35:27.180 --> 05:35:29.180
Oh, this cannot be

05:35:30.060 --> 05:35:32.060
No, no, no

05:35:33.500 --> 05:35:36.140
Come on pigeons have laser beams or something

05:35:37.020 --> 05:35:44.300
Stun them stun them so we can shoot them. I don't want him to perish. Okay. Yeah, the seven bullets was mean, but

05:35:45.980 --> 05:35:47.980
Oh

05:35:48.540 --> 05:35:50.540
Oh

05:36:00.700 --> 05:36:02.700
Come on

05:36:03.900 --> 05:36:07.260
Oh, is this good or bad you're smiling is this good or bad?

05:36:11.980 --> 05:36:13.980
I'll fuck off you

05:36:18.620 --> 05:36:20.620
You

05:36:43.900 --> 05:36:45.900
Eh

05:36:48.700 --> 05:36:50.700
But he's gonna bleed out

05:37:00.460 --> 05:37:02.460
Uh

05:37:10.060 --> 05:37:12.060
But Mother Moselle got to live

05:37:12.060 --> 05:37:14.060
Oh

05:37:21.580 --> 05:37:25.580
He maybe could have survived maybe I don't know

05:37:28.380 --> 05:37:31.660
I'd cut the gene. Please help us. Oh, thank god

05:37:34.780 --> 05:37:38.940
When no one would touch Winston like that, but I didn't want him to oh

05:37:42.380 --> 05:37:44.380
You

05:37:53.900 --> 05:37:55.900
The elder

05:38:05.900 --> 05:38:09.580
The elder above the high table is a dude in a desert

05:38:12.860 --> 05:38:15.340
Uh, maybe he likes the humble life

05:38:26.300 --> 05:38:28.300
Uh

05:38:31.900 --> 05:38:35.500
It was a few things went wrong that could have gone better, okay

05:38:42.780 --> 05:38:44.780
So

05:38:50.300 --> 05:38:52.300
Oh

05:38:53.340 --> 05:38:55.340

We don't want that life elder

05:39:34.940 --> 05:39:36.940
No

05:39:42.700 --> 05:39:46.700
We want to retire

05:39:54.380 --> 05:39:56.380

05:39:59.500 --> 05:40:05.580

05:46:34.940 --> 05:46:41.500

Well

05:47:49.260 --> 05:47:52.300
I'm gonna be honest. I probably would have held onto the sword but that's just me

05:47:53.340 --> 05:47:55.820
Well the rules apply now that you're officially pardoned

05:48:00.140 --> 05:48:03.740
So now it's just the high table actors. We need to be worried about

05:48:05.180 --> 05:48:10.940
The dark night. Yeah, wear a helmet dress for the slade not for the raid

05:48:14.700 --> 05:48:18.380

Fucking picking like the one that's like three away or something

05:49:37.260 --> 05:49:40.380
The rule of the toilet is you're not supposed to sit next to someone

05:49:45.980 --> 05:49:48.460
Don't move that make myself clear

05:49:53.020 --> 05:49:55.020

05:50:45.820 --> 05:50:47.820
Surely by the end of this one we give that name

05:50:57.420 --> 05:50:59.420
We're going for five languages

05:51:13.820 --> 05:51:15.820

05:51:42.220 --> 05:51:46.940
I don't think john would kill Winston. It doesn't make sense

05:51:49.820 --> 05:51:52.060
I feel like something else has to occur

05:51:56.140 --> 05:51:58.140
Mr. Winston

05:52:09.900 --> 05:52:11.900

I

06:15:54.780 --> 06:15:56.940
Actually kind of like these

06:15:56.940 --> 06:15:58.940
fights because it's like it shows

06:15:59.580 --> 06:16:05.900
Obviously it's to show like the desperation more than like a perfectly choreographed fight type thing

06:16:05.980 --> 06:16:10.460
So I just don't like it. I don't mind it. Sorry. Not that. I don't like it. I do like it

06:16:11.740 --> 06:16:15.020
Like I like that is messy. I like we're like fucking scrambling

06:16:16.140 --> 06:16:19.900
Rather than these like perfect executions off the back every single time

06:16:23.100 --> 06:16:25.100
And we're almost there I think

06:16:32.700 --> 06:16:38.460

06:30:07.820 --> 06:30:09.820
Mm-hmm

06:30:13.660 --> 06:30:15.660
Yeah

06:30:16.940 --> 06:30:18.940
I'm gonna take a look

06:30:21.500 --> 06:30:23.500
Yeah

06:30:25.180 --> 06:30:27.180
Yeah

06:30:27.180 --> 06:30:29.500
We're doing it. We're going against the high table

06:30:31.900 --> 06:30:35.500
Oh my god, we're doing it. Yeah

06:30:39.740 --> 06:30:44.460
John's becoming a real reflin type of put down the high table wink wink

06:30:45.180 --> 06:30:48.700
Okay, that's gonna be our codename the high table

06:30:50.540 --> 06:30:52.540
I'm real

06:30:55.420 --> 06:30:59.260
Oh my goodness, ah, I'm loving this

06:31:01.580 --> 06:31:04.860
Oh my god, are you to and we in part five isn't even out

06:31:06.220 --> 06:31:08.940
But we're gonna have to watch part four. We have part four now

06:31:09.900 --> 06:31:13.900
Healyberry wait, isn't Healyberry an X-Men?

06:31:17.420 --> 06:31:20.060
John wakers against the world

06:31:22.780 --> 06:31:28.700
Oh my gosh, I'm loving this. Sorry. I completely forgot to do wines during that entire like segment

06:31:29.580 --> 06:31:34.940
Oh, she is she is she is oh my god. We're going against the high table replays

06:31:35.500 --> 06:31:39.660
Yatta, she was the Casablanca lady

06:31:42.780 --> 06:31:49.900
Oh my gosh, we're doing it. We're doing it. Oh my gosh

06:31:53.820 --> 06:31:56.380
Okay, let me change it the title to four

06:31:57.500 --> 06:31:59.500
And then we'll get a quick break

06:32:00.060 --> 06:32:02.060
So I can

06:32:03.020 --> 06:32:06.060
Uh, right pause and then go next one

06:32:07.900 --> 06:32:09.900
You know like next

06:32:10.060 --> 06:32:12.060
That's it and pause

06:32:12.940 --> 06:32:16.940
Does that display? Yep, it does. What? How long is this movie?

06:32:20.460 --> 06:32:23.660
Okay, I'm going to heavily recommend

06:32:24.300 --> 06:32:28.700
Um, everyone get a snack and a stretch and a toilet and a

06:32:29.020 --> 06:32:32.300
Yes, uh, I did not realize

06:32:33.500 --> 06:32:35.900
How long this one is

06:32:38.220 --> 06:32:43.580
So maybe chapter five doesn't play off of four because this is so long

06:32:44.780 --> 06:32:47.500
Maybe we do all of the high table in one go

06:32:48.300 --> 06:32:51.900
Because for a three-hour movie, I feel like you can take out a lot of

06:32:52.940 --> 06:32:57.740
First the lady in the cloak the cloak goes first surely surely

06:32:59.340 --> 06:33:05.100
Well, what do we do about Winston? Do we understand that Winston didn't actually want to kill us?

06:33:05.100 --> 06:33:11.260
Or was he forced to? Is he still an ally? I'm not really sure what because he wasn't like

06:33:11.260 --> 06:33:16.700
Oh, yes, I will destroy John Wick right now. So I'm a bit uh, a bit curious about

06:33:17.980 --> 06:33:23.820
What Winston's arc is I keep bringing out those gloves, but I'm not trying to do a boxing match

06:33:24.780 --> 06:33:27.740
Uh, right, we're gonna find out we're gonna find out no spoilers

06:33:27.740 --> 06:33:33.980
Please the only time I ask for no hand-holding and no spoilers is we're gonna watch John Wick 4

06:33:34.380 --> 06:33:39.660
And I've never seen it. Uh, I don't think I saw it there. I don't really recall any of that

06:33:39.980 --> 06:33:43.100
I'm so glad the concierge got a little bit of a scene

06:33:43.660 --> 06:33:47.580
Um, I wish there was a bit more badassery coming from him

06:33:47.660 --> 06:33:55.900
I feel like the concierge is like the the doting kind of gentle until it's like time to call in the arms

06:33:56.460 --> 06:33:58.460
like that kind of thing

06:33:59.260 --> 06:34:00.860
um

06:34:00.860 --> 06:34:05.180
He shot my bulletproof vest, so I don't know if he meant to keep him alive

06:34:05.740 --> 06:34:07.900
I feel like he would have known he was alive

06:34:07.980 --> 06:34:11.580
But like y'all didn't put like a little crash mat down there for him

06:34:11.980 --> 06:34:15.740
You know, you could have could have moved it away by the time she went down the elevator

06:34:15.740 --> 06:34:21.180
And that's all I'm saying. Okay, the lift takes you know, I'm not saying you've got the fastest lifts in the continental

06:34:21.260 --> 06:34:26.540
But a little crash mat wouldn't have gone amiss. Uh, definitely would have helped out. Um

06:34:28.380 --> 06:34:30.380
But hey ho

06:34:30.380 --> 06:34:35.660
We are alive reefing willing is alive and reefing has been sent into take down the high table

06:34:35.740 --> 06:34:39.660
Which I'm very curious to see how this goes. Um, I also didn't mention

06:34:40.700 --> 06:34:44.140
We're officially in the 30 thousands for our wanes

06:34:44.540 --> 06:34:46.940
um, I believe a

06:34:47.500 --> 06:34:55.100
A lovely reefing has done the maths and they said that my wanes in my bank if I do them

06:34:55.180 --> 06:34:56.780
I am 99

06:34:56.780 --> 06:35:00.220
uh, we are at 36,000 so

06:35:01.580 --> 06:35:02.620
They're

06:35:02.620 --> 06:35:04.620
Maybe if I can get it down to

06:35:05.260 --> 06:35:07.260
20,000

06:35:08.460 --> 06:35:10.620
Oh, I don't know if I have time for 20,000

06:35:11.020 --> 06:35:15.980
Maybe then tomorrow's endurance stream. We might actually do it

06:35:17.100 --> 06:35:24.620
Um, what level of cooking am I now? I am 90 um 100 xp off of 91

06:35:26.300 --> 06:35:31.500
Um, but we are cooking by gas. We're getting there. We're getting close

06:35:32.540 --> 06:35:34.380
um

06:35:34.380 --> 06:35:38.220
Right, I am going to get a cup of tea. I'm going to get some food. I'm going to get a few snacks

06:35:38.220 --> 06:35:43.740
I'll be a wee bit longer. I'm going to take a toilet break. Um, I just need to tinkle just because again

06:35:43.820 --> 06:35:46.700
I highly recommend you do it as well if you're watching john

06:35:47.500 --> 06:35:53.820
A wick four the one reefing that's called john right now is just constantly

06:35:54.380 --> 06:35:55.500
Oh

06:35:55.500 --> 06:36:00.300
In his chair john john john john john johnny jonathan big john zoe

06:36:01.340 --> 06:36:02.700
big johnny boy

06:36:03.660 --> 06:36:07.020
Everyone's like going to start once we get marshmallows back

06:36:07.100 --> 06:36:11.980
Everyone's going to start sending messages that secretly have their name in it and hopes I say like the main name

06:36:12.540 --> 06:36:15.340
I don't know if anyone was called sam, but we watched um

06:36:16.540 --> 06:36:17.660
Um

06:36:17.660 --> 06:36:22.540
Transformers and the main guy's called sam wit wiki. So I was like sam sam sam

06:36:23.260 --> 06:36:29.740
Um, but I find it fun that like I might there's a there's a chance. I might like say your name just by just by chance

06:36:30.460 --> 06:36:33.980
Yeah, that john literally mean currently legally changing my name to john

06:36:34.780 --> 06:36:40.860
Approximately 1.5 of people in the us are named john or some variation of that. Wow. That's a big number

06:36:42.140 --> 06:36:45.180
If that uh, but you guys okay, okay

06:36:45.980 --> 06:36:51.420

06:36:58.140 --> 06:37:00.140
We're getting there

06:37:00.220 --> 06:37:05.900
Honestly, I don't know if you can speedrun crafting crafting's been I was interested in crafting

06:37:06.860 --> 06:37:13.260
But I maybe would do that in my own time. I'll maybe not uh make you guys watch crafting. I think the runescape streams

06:37:13.820 --> 06:37:16.060
Um, I'm definitely happy to take a bit of a break

06:37:16.620 --> 06:37:21.420
After other than doing questing together ones. I don't mind the questing. Those are those are fun as anything

06:37:22.140 --> 06:37:23.260
um

06:37:23.260 --> 06:37:27.740
But yes, please get a snack. Please go for a tinkle. I'm going to do the exact same

06:37:27.820 --> 06:37:33.420
I'll be a couple of moments and then we'll jump straight back into the john wick. Shall we?

06:37:34.300 --> 06:37:39.900
Crafting is quickish, but it costs a lot of money. You'll never guess how much money I have in my runescape bank account

06:37:40.300 --> 06:37:46.940
Okay, give me a minute. I'll be back uh to make a cup of tea and a pee and you should definitely stretch your legs

06:44:40.300 --> 06:44:41.820
Sorry my

06:44:41.820 --> 06:44:43.820
Fuck that's so bloody loud honestly

06:44:45.020 --> 06:44:51.820
The desktop music is separate and it's so loud when you're not signed in. Oh my god. That was blaring

06:44:53.580 --> 06:44:54.620
Wow

06:44:54.620 --> 06:45:00.140
Thank you. Doomsday damn for the tip and do lay lover via lure for the five

06:45:00.780 --> 06:45:04.060
Would you do another members karaoke stream? Absolutely. Yes. Um

06:45:05.420 --> 06:45:07.420
I think I have like

06:45:08.460 --> 06:45:13.260
I actually don't think it'll be a problem all from my voice because I've already worked it to be honest

06:45:14.060 --> 06:45:16.060
the what right so

06:45:16.540 --> 06:45:20.140
I've permanently damaged my voice, which is fine. It's not a big deal

06:45:20.780 --> 06:45:22.780
but the actual

06:45:23.580 --> 06:45:25.580
The actual

06:45:25.900 --> 06:45:27.900
positive of it is that

06:45:28.700 --> 06:45:33.180
I can keep going now if that makes sense now that is damaged like I can keep going

06:45:34.540 --> 06:45:41.180
And the damage was just singing which doesn't really make much of a difference to me because I don't like I don't have an interest like

06:45:41.580 --> 06:45:48.060
Some vtubers like absolutely have like a full interest in singing for me personally. I couldn't give less about

06:45:49.020 --> 06:45:51.020
Um

06:45:51.340 --> 06:45:54.620
Mum is back. Yes. Oh no the runescape. Yeah

06:45:55.500 --> 06:45:58.060
Still down runescape. You're stuck with me

06:45:59.100 --> 06:46:04.460
Um, right. I've got a cup of sorry. You didn't see that. I've got a cup of tea

06:46:05.340 --> 06:46:11.900
Um, I actually didn't see any snacks that I was interested in so I literally have tea cola and water

06:46:12.220 --> 06:46:13.580
um

06:46:13.580 --> 06:46:18.940
To last me through these three hours. I keep forgetting to boil new eggs so I can just grab them for stream

06:46:19.020 --> 06:46:19.740
but

06:46:19.740 --> 06:46:24.060
It's fine. It's fine. Um as for tomorrow's stream

06:46:26.140 --> 06:46:29.260
It's a 50 50 if it gets changed for something else

06:46:29.340 --> 06:46:33.420
I don't know if I can do two back-to-back endurance streams without absolutely annihilating my health

06:46:33.500 --> 06:46:35.500
I'll see what kind of sleep I get

06:46:35.740 --> 06:46:42.380
But I'm just warning you now. I don't know if we're gonna be able to finish off the wines tomorrow. Um

06:46:43.260 --> 06:46:45.340
because I might be

06:46:45.900 --> 06:46:47.900
um

06:46:47.900 --> 06:46:53.740
Just doing something smaller because I've got a few things to do for the girls. Um, they've been absolutely fantastic. So the

06:46:55.020 --> 06:46:59.420
The editors that work for veal were um, they're getting put to work

06:46:59.500 --> 06:47:01.500
We're gonna see what the kind of price return

06:47:02.060 --> 06:47:04.060
Etc is and then

06:47:04.780 --> 06:47:08.380
Yeah, don't be surprised if you see a hell of a lot more consist

06:47:08.860 --> 06:47:13.100
Short consistency now that the the dust is settled. Um

06:47:13.900 --> 06:47:17.900
We currently have four clippers. I have my own personal clip editor

06:47:18.380 --> 06:47:24.700
Um, but I might hit get her to do some her names are rissa. Hi rissa. I doubt your your but

06:47:25.100 --> 06:47:30.380
Um, she's such a nerd. She plays dnd and she's like oh my dnd cancelled

06:47:30.460 --> 06:47:33.420
I can do some more editing for you and I'm like, oh, that's so adorable

06:47:33.580 --> 06:47:36.220
Are you sure you want to like not take the day off or whatever?

06:47:36.780 --> 06:47:43.340
But um, yeah, rissa's really cool. I like her. Um, and she's Australian. So it makes me even cooler. Um

06:47:44.380 --> 06:47:49.580
I might I'm gonna see if I can get one more clipper on board. Um

06:47:51.340 --> 06:47:53.340
Cause

06:47:54.060 --> 06:47:57.420
Uh, I'm starting to want to get highlight reels of the girls

06:47:58.780 --> 06:48:01.420
And shorts coming out a bit more consistently

06:48:01.660 --> 06:48:07.020
I'm gonna aim for three shorts per week and see how that works out because obviously

06:48:07.580 --> 06:48:11.820
You guys have been fantastic clipping the girls. By the way, I see sent me

06:48:12.220 --> 06:48:18.620
I like instructed the girls on how to how to show me the clips that they want turned into a short on youtube

06:48:19.100 --> 06:48:24.300
And I see came through she was like scrawny. I'm so sorry for all this

06:48:24.540 --> 06:48:28.300
I like do not be silly. You have literally like saved me so much time

06:48:28.380 --> 06:48:35.100
You've given me such high quality clips. Like don't be silly. So thank you special. Thank you to literally anyone who is

06:48:35.340 --> 06:48:37.340
mucking about clipping

06:48:37.740 --> 06:48:45.580
Like any funny ha ha's of any of the girls you help out so much with these shorts that we're gonna start making and posting and all that jazz

06:48:45.900 --> 06:48:47.900
like mercy, um

06:48:48.300 --> 06:48:52.860
Had like a hilarious short. I don't know if you've seen it. Oh, sorry. My cats are going nuts. Um

06:48:53.820 --> 06:48:56.300
I just fed them. So they're probably going to actually not

06:48:57.020 --> 06:48:59.020
Breaking my door. Um

06:48:59.260 --> 06:49:01.420
Mercy had this like hilarious short

06:49:02.220 --> 06:49:06.620
Someone asked her like, oh, are you going to do a cooking stream? And she told the story about a time

06:49:06.860 --> 06:49:12.620
She freaking was cutting upside down with a knife and I'm like, oh my god

06:49:13.660 --> 06:49:17.580
I thought like I thought we were kind of memeing that mercy is like the pawn one

06:49:17.980 --> 06:49:20.540
No, mercy is the pawn one

06:49:21.020 --> 06:49:26.140
Like it was the most it was the funniest short I've ever seen in ages. I absolutely adore it. So don't be afraid to like

06:49:26.940 --> 06:49:33.020
I think if you click subscriptions, you can like scroll down like two and then it shows like shorts of who you're subscribed to

06:49:33.100 --> 06:49:36.940
So don't be afraid to like look at whatever the girls are like posting if you've subscribed to us all

06:49:37.340 --> 06:49:41.500
Which I know you have subscribed to us all haven't you?

06:49:42.620 --> 06:49:44.620
Yes, good

06:49:45.580 --> 06:49:51.580
Let's see if you want to get 99 crafting at some point the typical trading method is minus 30 million

06:49:51.660 --> 06:49:53.660
I wonder what the time is in crafting up

06:49:54.140 --> 06:50:00.860
I'm getting addicted a little bit to runescape, but not as addicted to balochro balochro. Uh, yes. Yes. Good. That's all I'd hear

06:50:01.340 --> 06:50:02.940
I demand

06:50:02.940 --> 06:50:04.940
unification, okay

06:50:05.180 --> 06:50:08.460
That's funny. Like bro the pawn levels are so high upside down now

06:50:08.620 --> 06:50:13.740
Literally a yandere that doesn't know how to night hold a knife properly is the funniest story

06:50:13.820 --> 06:50:15.820
I think I've ever fucking heard in my life

06:50:16.060 --> 06:50:22.140
Um, and it was edited so well like that editor like was above and beyond he does fantastic. Um

06:50:23.420 --> 06:50:27.580
40 hours. Oh shit. How much is cooking? How many hours have I put into cooking?

06:50:27.980 --> 06:50:31.580
Well, the first stream didn't count because I was getting distracted mucking about with you

06:50:31.980 --> 06:50:35.580
We were doing questing so the first runescape stream doesn't actually count

06:50:36.540 --> 06:50:37.740
Um

06:50:37.740 --> 06:50:41.260
I wasn't able to clip yesterday stream. No, no, no, don't worry. Don't worry if you can't do it

06:50:41.260 --> 06:50:47.260
But like for any like literally for anyone who goes back and is like, oh that moment made me blow air out of my nose

06:50:47.260 --> 06:50:53.820
A little bit faster. Hmm. It helps out so much. It really does. Uh, azer gave me a bunch as well. I am gonna

06:50:55.420 --> 06:51:00.700
Um, see if I can get some going for sheebie. I was having problems with sheebie shorts. Um,

06:51:01.260 --> 06:51:05.820
I think I mentioned this the other day. She's so boobalicious that um

06:51:06.700 --> 06:51:12.940
YouTube basically limited pretty much everything which sucked. Um

06:51:13.740 --> 06:51:18.300
I couldn't put advertise like you can put youtube ads to like make her

06:51:19.020 --> 06:51:23.260
Like their shorts show up in the algorithm more, but because she'd be so boobalicious

06:51:23.260 --> 06:51:29.980
I wasn't having it. Although Azura's it let through and I'm like, I think we can all agree. Azura's got bigger oranges than

06:51:30.540 --> 06:51:34.700
Sheepsters, so I'm not really sure how they determine it one minute

06:51:34.700 --> 06:51:38.300
They're discriminating against Azura the next minute. They're like, ah, that's fine

06:51:38.940 --> 06:51:42.380
Cookin's 30 hours. Why am I taking so long then honestly?

06:51:43.980 --> 06:51:48.380
I find I tend to clip a lot more when watching vods. Yes, especially

06:51:48.380 --> 06:51:54.140
Thank you to any vod watchers that like go back and clip or timestamp like funny moments as well

06:51:54.220 --> 06:52:01.020
I am able to see that on my end. Um, but I have asked the girls to take on that responsibility because uh

06:52:01.580 --> 06:52:05.420
If you didn't know most VTuber agencies don't

06:52:05.980 --> 06:52:11.100
Actually create like thumbnails or they tell their girls to like make shorts

06:52:11.660 --> 06:52:16.460
Themselves or out of pocket and I'm like no if you guys just give me the clip

06:52:16.540 --> 06:52:20.300
I'll send it off to a clipper and pay for that and then I'll pay for promotion as well like

06:52:20.940 --> 06:52:22.220
um

06:52:22.220 --> 06:52:27.980
It's quite outrageous what some of these VTuber agencies ask of their talent in my opinion

06:52:28.060 --> 06:52:31.980
But and that's just how it is. So hopefully over time things can change like, um

06:52:33.180 --> 06:52:38.780
Sock VTuber agency looks like it's going to be different, which I'm very happy and excited about um

06:52:39.820 --> 06:52:41.420
I

06:52:41.420 --> 06:52:42.540
um

06:52:42.540 --> 06:52:47.660
I'm very happy to see the rise of new agencies and learn the behind the scenes. Um

06:52:48.380 --> 06:52:53.260
Obviously, we've been incredibly friendly with the yumi plus girls and the behind the scenes

06:52:53.260 --> 06:52:55.740
I got to learn a bit more about them and I am

06:52:56.300 --> 06:53:01.900
Uh, very happy with the direction they're going. So I'm happy to obviously muck about with them. Um

06:53:02.860 --> 06:53:10.540
And hopefully the girls find prosperity under prosperity prosperity prosperity not prosperity

06:53:10.620 --> 06:53:16.860
I think that's a different word. Uh prosperity, uh, pros the good one the good one live long and prosper that one

06:53:17.580 --> 06:53:24.380
I yes live long and prosper for the girls and um, I'm very excited for what the future holds for yumi plus. Um

06:53:25.020 --> 06:53:29.740
I do genuinely think these kinds of VTuber agencies, uh

06:53:30.700 --> 06:53:32.380
definitely

06:53:32.380 --> 06:53:33.980
more of a

06:53:33.980 --> 06:53:35.180
What's

06:53:35.180 --> 06:53:39.660
More of a more and poor vibe. I think is very nice

06:53:40.300 --> 06:53:46.060
Is posterity boobs or something? I don't know as there has more but there's more ropes on yeah

06:53:46.860 --> 06:53:49.500
I mean it pays for itself investment is visibility

06:53:50.300 --> 06:53:51.500
Um

06:53:51.500 --> 06:53:57.980
Yes, and no the reason I say no is because the books haven't been done for the first month of peeler yet

06:53:58.300 --> 06:54:04.780
And I don't know if I've I've spent like way much in like advertising watch along. There's a few hidden things as well

06:54:04.780 --> 06:54:06.140
That was paid for

06:54:06.140 --> 06:54:11.180
Um, the shorts are being paid for so I need to do I need the books to be done

06:54:11.260 --> 06:54:13.820
I don't do the books because obviously I'm number dyslexic

06:54:14.220 --> 06:54:19.900
Um, I'm waiting on the bookkeeper to do their part once the first of july rolls around

06:54:20.300 --> 06:54:23.580
And then I'll be able to see what the agency earned

06:54:24.300 --> 06:54:31.580
And then that means I can maybe talk about my donathon goals. We're a bit far away. We're still

06:54:32.220 --> 06:54:36.620
We're still not even clear. We're you know, october's my donathon

06:54:36.620 --> 06:54:42.140
But as I said, my donathon is related to the agency. It's not related for myself

06:54:42.460 --> 06:54:51.740
Whereas the girls donathons are related to potentially moving out or doing more content or having the availability to do certain things. Um

06:54:53.900 --> 06:54:57.820
Posterior is your rear. Wait put posterior

06:54:58.540 --> 06:55:00.380
Why is that?

06:55:00.380 --> 06:55:01.900
Why is that?

06:55:01.900 --> 06:55:05.340
Oh, we're also gonna have to watch monty python at one point

06:55:07.020 --> 06:55:10.060
And before actually we ran out of money collapse. Oh, no, I

06:55:11.020 --> 06:55:14.220
For me personally, um from what I've seen

06:55:15.100 --> 06:55:18.060
No, the company is not running out of money. Uh

06:55:19.020 --> 06:55:20.460
I

06:55:20.460 --> 06:55:27.020
When it comes to ROI, which is return on investment. Uh, yeah, let's just say I'm no worries

06:55:28.140 --> 06:55:31.980
You guys have been incredibly supportive incredibly generous

06:55:32.220 --> 06:55:39.580
Um, the patreons are popping off the merchandise. Thank you for anyone that buys from uwu market because that

06:55:40.140 --> 06:55:42.940
profit margins all go to the talent. It is the we

06:55:43.580 --> 06:55:48.620
We vealor do not get cut. We it doesn't even go through our hands. They own like the accounts and everything

06:55:49.180 --> 06:55:50.700
um

06:55:50.700 --> 06:55:53.500
And we hopefully have some very exciting news soon to him. Uh

06:55:54.700 --> 06:55:59.180
Posterior meaning behind posterity meaning past. Well, I got it completely wrong

06:55:59.260 --> 06:56:05.820
Yes, we're gonna watch the life of brian because you freaking fanies keep taunting me with fondle of bism

06:56:06.380 --> 06:56:10.700
And it's like, is there something wrong with the way I say

06:56:11.500 --> 06:56:13.500
fondle of bism

06:56:14.860 --> 06:56:17.820
She has a what she has a yandere, you know

06:56:19.100 --> 06:56:20.860
karam

06:56:20.860 --> 06:56:22.700
Karambit

06:56:22.700 --> 06:56:29.580
Basically is how that's gonna go. Um, so you guys are so done when we watch that together. Um, absolutely done

06:56:30.300 --> 06:56:33.820
Um, because Lucas is fondle of bism

06:56:33.820 --> 06:56:39.100
Look, it was a good name. It wasn't a bad name. I actually like the name

06:56:40.220 --> 06:56:43.180
I don't know. Maybe I'll I'll get her to have a halloween outfit

06:56:43.740 --> 06:56:47.500
um, and then like she has a tag on her head that says fondle of bism

06:56:48.620 --> 06:56:50.220
and

06:56:50.220 --> 06:56:53.340
Just as long as we don't watch the holy grail. Wait, what's wrong with the holy grail?

06:56:53.980 --> 06:56:55.980
Have I seen that? I think I've seen

06:56:56.860 --> 06:56:58.540
life of brian

06:56:58.540 --> 06:57:01.180
with my family at christmas actually

06:57:02.140 --> 06:57:09.020
Uh, hey, it's karambit herself. Hey, and you come and you come fondle of bism jen to strawney 365

06:57:09.340 --> 06:57:15.900
Look, it was a good concept that now I remember why the numbers the numbers are because I wanted to stream for one year in a row

06:57:17.340 --> 06:57:19.340
Barring absolute death. Okay

06:57:20.140 --> 06:57:26.220
Holy grail is fine. Is it not huge tracks of land mods kill this roofling. Wait. Oh, no, what happened?

06:57:26.860 --> 06:57:28.860
Oh, the movies were overrated

06:57:29.100 --> 06:57:31.100
Oh

06:57:32.620 --> 06:57:37.100
What wins that goes oh, oh 91 91

06:57:38.620 --> 06:57:42.540
Always look on the bright sidey life

06:57:43.260 --> 06:57:46.220
Whistle whistle whistle whistle whistle

06:57:46.940 --> 06:57:48.940
Remember that time that mercy can't whistle

07:25:10.300 --> 07:25:12.300
They have an adoptive daughter

07:25:13.260 --> 07:25:18.780
No, no, we can't sorry we have to destroy the high table. We can't be your like adoptive father, okay

07:25:25.340 --> 07:25:33.820
I think maybe we protect her and drop her in a safe house possibly it's the only way I can see them

07:25:42.300 --> 07:25:44.300
You

07:25:55.420 --> 07:25:57.420

Oh

07:26:22.220 --> 07:26:24.220
Oh

07:26:24.220 --> 07:26:26.220
Oh

07:26:50.140 --> 07:26:52.300
Are we actually gonna get beaten up by a blind man

07:26:55.180 --> 07:26:57.180
Old friend

07:27:01.180 --> 07:27:03.820
Is he a common voice actor I feel like he is

07:27:08.140 --> 07:27:11.820
He sounds like Genji and shit, but it might just be my ignorance

07:27:18.140 --> 07:27:20.140
Alive

07:27:24.220 --> 07:27:26.220
You

07:27:49.100 --> 07:27:51.100
Oh fuck off

07:27:54.220 --> 07:27:56.220
You

07:28:01.660 --> 07:28:03.660
Went already in position

07:28:10.460 --> 07:28:12.460
You leave me no choice

07:28:17.980 --> 07:28:19.980
I don't like this

07:28:24.220 --> 07:28:26.220
You

07:28:54.220 --> 07:28:56.960
Are you telling me they don't have access to guns

07:29:24.620 --> 07:29:31.020
Yeah, we playing like Civ 6 right now and Japan hasn't developed weaponry yet. They're just like on max on culture

07:29:34.220 --> 07:29:36.220
I'll come on

07:29:49.580 --> 07:29:51.580
Reinforcements

07:29:54.540 --> 07:29:56.540
You

07:30:12.300 --> 07:30:14.300
John needs the bones

07:30:24.220 --> 07:30:26.220
You

07:30:33.740 --> 07:30:36.940
We'll have the saccharin tree isn't so sweet anymore

07:30:54.220 --> 07:30:57.180
Oh

07:31:24.220 --> 07:31:26.220
Oh

07:31:32.300 --> 07:31:34.300
It was splits though

07:31:41.260 --> 07:31:47.020
Now we have the badass lady on earth say oh well we had it with a Halle Berry

07:31:54.460 --> 07:31:56.460
Oh

07:32:00.700 --> 07:32:02.700
That was a very unique

07:32:12.380 --> 07:32:14.380
Uh

07:32:17.100 --> 07:32:22.220
Honestly means fuck if I'm gonna die I want a nice bowl of chicken ramen in this belly

07:32:24.780 --> 07:32:26.780
Is

07:32:28.540 --> 07:32:35.580
Anyone remember when they the first movie was really realistic when I was not me you win some you lose some

07:32:41.980 --> 07:32:43.980
Oh my god

07:32:45.820 --> 07:32:47.820
Bro bro bro

07:32:54.860 --> 07:32:59.500
This this our arrows are Pearson

07:33:07.340 --> 07:33:09.340
Oh, it's Hennessy in the noodles

07:33:17.420 --> 07:33:19.420
Is that a blowdar

07:33:24.700 --> 07:33:26.700
You

07:33:36.220 --> 07:33:41.820
Can I say something really controversial and it's not very nice

07:33:46.380 --> 07:33:53.180
I really hope this enemy is defeated quickly because the gimmick is pretty bad

07:33:55.180 --> 07:33:58.700
I know that's not nice, but that gimmick is a bit too strong

07:34:00.140 --> 07:34:02.140
I hope he perishes quickly

07:34:03.340 --> 07:34:05.580
I swear if he makes it through the three hours

07:34:07.820 --> 07:34:09.820
Like I get it don't get me wrong

07:34:13.100 --> 07:34:14.300
But

07:34:14.300 --> 07:34:21.580
You don't like the idea of a blind man killing everyone. Yeah, and like being able to sense arrows going past. Yeah, I have dead in it

07:34:21.820 --> 07:34:23.820
I really enjoyed

07:34:25.820 --> 07:34:28.380
The other concepts they put forward, but this is a bit

07:34:31.020 --> 07:34:35.900
Like the old sensey thing she hates the school of blind fury. Wait, is that a movie or something?

07:34:36.780 --> 07:34:38.780
Bro, he's literally using the force

07:34:40.460 --> 07:34:43.580
Okay, I like the ding dong aid assists, but

07:34:43.900 --> 07:34:51.580
If you're gonna tell me there's a fight between him and John Wick like come on

07:35:08.220 --> 07:35:10.540
He's a Jedi in another life honestly

07:35:14.140 --> 07:35:16.140
No, he's just tough. Okay

07:35:18.940 --> 07:35:21.740
You see his toes out if he's tough

07:35:28.540 --> 07:35:31.420
Ouch stuntman, I hope you got paid well for that

07:35:36.780 --> 07:35:40.780
Stranny hates blind people. No, I do not hate blind people

07:35:41.740 --> 07:35:43.740
I think you're doing awesome

07:35:47.740 --> 07:35:49.660
Did you know that um

07:35:49.660 --> 07:35:53.260
blindness like it to get uh diagnosed with blindness and

07:35:53.900 --> 07:36:00.460
Over 50% of like the blindness diagnosis still have some vision. It's not like straight up like see nothing blindness

07:36:00.540 --> 07:36:03.500
like a lot of those who are diagnosed with it still have some sort of like

07:36:03.980 --> 07:36:05.660
light

07:36:05.660 --> 07:36:07.660
perspective and

07:36:07.660 --> 07:36:09.260
and

07:36:09.340 --> 07:36:14.780
Extreme prescription that kind of thing. It's not necessarily like straight up knee nothing going on at all

07:36:15.980 --> 07:36:17.980
So yeah, just thought you should know

07:36:18.860 --> 07:36:20.860
There's also degenerative um

07:36:22.300 --> 07:36:25.900
Ones where you're born with sight but over time you become blind as you go on

07:36:28.620 --> 07:36:34.380
Wait mommy japan discovered guns. Sorry. I'm getting I'm getting too much into facts about the population and stuff

07:36:39.420 --> 07:36:41.420
I

07:36:46.860 --> 07:36:48.860
Me are steaks stop it

07:36:52.540 --> 07:36:54.540
Bruh

07:36:57.260 --> 07:37:01.740
Let's see got her hair is I love that design though you yanking it

07:37:09.420 --> 07:37:18.620
Hard to hypnotize someone when they're blind. Damn you got me. She's ice-claiming this man. Oh, no

07:37:22.620 --> 07:37:24.620
Wait, they're gonna kill her

07:37:28.300 --> 07:37:32.380
It was it was just a major organ. It's fine

07:37:39.660 --> 07:37:41.660
Yes

07:37:56.780 --> 07:37:58.780
As you will it

07:38:10.060 --> 07:38:12.060
Oh

07:38:17.740 --> 07:38:21.020
Sue wait is this also mean like

07:38:21.660 --> 07:38:26.780
Because obviously that game's called also like do your best or am I being an idiot?

07:38:27.660 --> 07:38:29.660
No gambates do your best

07:38:39.580 --> 07:38:41.580
I

07:38:42.060 --> 07:38:51.020
Like how the enemy design have only masks for this region as well as like another nod to the culture and to appreciate it

07:39:05.740 --> 07:39:07.740
Gambate

07:39:09.260 --> 07:39:11.260
You

07:39:11.260 --> 07:39:13.260
You

07:39:13.260 --> 07:39:15.260
You

07:39:37.980 --> 07:39:41.980
Num I twat myself on num chucks. I just know that for a fact

07:39:44.140 --> 07:39:46.140
You

07:39:53.020 --> 07:39:55.020
The armor is amazing on the enemies

07:40:07.660 --> 07:40:09.660
I think you've gotten

07:40:13.260 --> 07:40:16.220
You

07:40:44.220 --> 07:40:46.220
You

07:40:54.460 --> 07:40:58.780
Wait, what day is it for America is it Saturday or Friday right now for America?

07:41:08.060 --> 07:41:13.180
Friday, okay good. Sorry. Okay tomorrow the highlights for debut. Okay

07:41:13.260 --> 07:41:16.620
Thank you. Thank you. I was like, oh wait a minute

07:41:16.620 --> 07:41:21.180
Wasn't I supposed to have the highlights for debut coming out on Saturday?

07:41:21.180 --> 07:41:24.220
And I was like, uh, what day is it for you guys? Smile

07:41:27.820 --> 07:41:30.540
Okay, okay tomorrow the highlights of debut come out

07:41:32.380 --> 07:41:37.420
On everyone's channel. I will do that when I wake up after my sleep

07:41:43.660 --> 07:41:45.660
You

07:41:57.900 --> 07:42:00.940
Don't do the fancy whipping around it's not that hard to not get hit

07:42:01.340 --> 07:42:03.900
I don't know. I feel like I'd be like that with a whip as well

07:42:03.980 --> 07:42:06.780
Like those kind of weapons that can horribly backfire

07:42:07.020 --> 07:42:11.740
I'd probably have like the worst scar on my face after whipping the crap out of myself

07:42:12.700 --> 07:42:14.700
And because whip scars don't heal

07:42:35.900 --> 07:42:39.180
Just a simple swinging trapping it under your arm against

07:42:39.820 --> 07:42:42.300
Requires a high dexterity score

07:42:43.340 --> 07:42:47.740
I have like the only thing I have going for me is luck

07:42:49.180 --> 07:42:54.540
And endurance these are the only two attributes if you had to like make a player card of me

07:42:55.180 --> 07:43:00.380
Luck and endurance is the only two things and it has gotten me so far. I have zero perspective

07:43:00.700 --> 07:43:06.540
Um, like I have no idea what's going on around me. No not perspective. What's the perception? That's it

07:43:07.020 --> 07:43:12.460
I have no idea what's going on around me. I've not now charisma possibly got some points in charisma

07:43:13.420 --> 07:43:15.420
and

07:43:15.820 --> 07:43:17.820
Oh

07:43:18.220 --> 07:43:21.660
Oh, please tell me this face done in like three sayings. Come on

07:43:36.540 --> 07:43:38.540
You

07:44:06.540 --> 07:44:08.540
You

07:44:27.340 --> 07:44:29.500
Wrap it up wrap it up come on

07:44:31.500 --> 07:44:34.540
I've dead man. I'm not feeling this. I'm not feeling this section

07:44:37.500 --> 07:44:39.500
A gunfight with a blind guy really

07:44:44.380 --> 07:44:49.020
In my solitude wrap it up like let's go to the next one

07:44:53.900 --> 07:44:55.900
He does what to the gun

07:44:56.460 --> 07:45:00.460
If you don't have subtitles on it says caulk's gun and it's spelt that way

07:45:01.580 --> 07:45:03.580
So that was a terrible joke

07:45:06.540 --> 07:45:08.540
I

07:45:08.780 --> 07:45:14.780
Literally just beat him by throwing something a little to the right and then one pop and game, you know gg

07:45:15.900 --> 07:45:17.900
Come on

07:45:18.540 --> 07:45:21.180
Stop talking you're giving away your eco location

07:45:22.380 --> 07:45:26.460
Oh, I'm I'm gonna start spanking the dirt is script writers for this one. I have to admit

07:45:27.500 --> 07:45:33.420
Man cling clang and on fucking stuff in the room and you're like, oh gee. I wonder where he is cling clang cling clang

07:45:37.420 --> 07:45:39.420
Oh, okay nice one John

07:45:52.780 --> 07:45:54.780
I wish Johnny would caulk my gun

07:45:59.260 --> 07:46:02.540
I'm gonna play that fucking ps4 horror game where you don't breathe

07:46:06.540 --> 07:46:08.540
You

07:46:36.860 --> 07:46:38.860
You

07:46:49.740 --> 07:46:51.740
Hey

07:46:52.700 --> 07:46:54.700
Friend or fool

07:46:56.060 --> 07:46:58.060
What

07:47:06.540 --> 07:47:08.540
You

07:47:10.060 --> 07:47:12.060
Friend or fool what

07:47:21.100 --> 07:47:23.100
Neither

07:47:36.700 --> 07:47:38.700
You

07:47:46.860 --> 07:47:48.860
20 million

07:47:51.580 --> 07:47:53.580
That was a lot of money

07:48:06.540 --> 07:48:08.540
I

07:48:15.900 --> 07:48:19.660
I'm starting to understand why this movie is three hours long. I think we've legit had no

07:48:21.900 --> 07:48:26.300
Fucking plot for like the last 30 minutes it's all been fighting

07:48:28.940 --> 07:48:30.940
Hey

07:48:32.140 --> 07:48:35.020
Hi friend, please

07:48:36.700 --> 07:48:38.700
You

07:48:44.060 --> 07:48:46.060
What are you a fan

07:48:47.900 --> 07:48:50.400
Please don't set the dog on me. I'd appreciate that

07:49:06.540 --> 07:49:15.660
I was talking about the cowboys though

07:49:20.940 --> 07:49:27.260
What he just wants the bounty until it's bigger and then he can disappear

07:49:33.980 --> 07:49:35.980
Yeah, damn

07:49:36.860 --> 07:49:38.860
It's honey

07:49:40.620 --> 07:49:47.020
So the bounty keeps growing. Oh, I want them to live

07:49:55.500 --> 07:49:57.500
Please let them live

07:49:59.260 --> 07:50:01.260
No

07:50:01.660 --> 07:50:07.180
Modes eliminate this blind man

07:50:24.860 --> 07:50:27.900
Oh, no, no, no, come on

07:50:28.300 --> 07:50:31.980
He's gonna die right in front of his freaking daughter

07:50:34.300 --> 07:50:36.300
Oh

07:50:39.020 --> 07:50:42.220
How did they make these action films so sad

07:50:51.420 --> 07:50:53.420
Modes take this man's dry row away

07:50:54.380 --> 07:50:57.900
Actually about one person probably understood that reference

07:51:00.140 --> 07:51:05.660
Dry row is the disability paycheck you get if you're legally like disabled or the the doctor

07:51:06.300 --> 07:51:09.260
Deems you unfit for work. So that was a very poor joke, but

07:51:11.820 --> 07:51:17.260
I just want this guy gone. I don't like the plot surrounding him. I don't I'm sorry. I said it

07:51:18.220 --> 07:51:20.300
Please John Wick pop out of the water and just

07:51:21.100 --> 07:51:23.100
And let it be done

07:51:24.220 --> 07:51:26.220
Oh

07:51:32.060 --> 07:51:34.060
Just let them win

07:51:42.780 --> 07:51:49.740
Like one old man, you're totally gonna win this there's your chance this old man is winning the stank fight

07:51:53.420 --> 07:51:55.420
You

07:52:23.980 --> 07:52:25.980
You

07:52:34.140 --> 07:52:36.140
All right, I was most stomach as you heard that

07:52:54.140 --> 07:52:56.140
What

07:53:01.340 --> 07:53:03.340
Is he not bleeding out

07:53:07.100 --> 07:53:09.100
What I don't understand

07:53:15.020 --> 07:53:17.020
Wait so he could have survived the injuries

07:53:17.260 --> 07:53:23.980
And he was gonna leave the daughter alone

07:53:35.660 --> 07:53:39.900
I'm not even crying from upset. I am getting frustrated now

07:53:43.820 --> 07:53:45.820
Uh

07:53:45.900 --> 07:53:50.860
Can we can can we get timestamp when blind man die dies

07:54:04.060 --> 07:54:09.180
I'm gonna say the script rewires are definitely different in this bloody movie because the

07:54:10.540 --> 07:54:13.740
The vibe and the change is

07:54:16.780 --> 07:54:18.780
So

07:54:27.180 --> 07:54:31.260
Well, it seems like she's gonna get him at least later date

07:54:38.620 --> 07:54:39.820
Wrap it up

07:54:40.460 --> 07:54:42.380
I'm not spoiling it

07:54:42.380 --> 07:54:48.060
That last indication and the shot made it seem like she will be the reason the man perishes at least

07:54:48.620 --> 07:54:55.020
So my i'm allowed to predict or is that really annoying if the person predicts a street like the how the movie's gonna go

07:54:56.220 --> 07:54:59.020
I'm uh, yes to predictions or no to predictions

07:54:59.980 --> 07:55:01.980
You

07:55:07.740 --> 07:55:09.740
Can always predict okay, just don't answer

07:55:10.300 --> 07:55:13.260
Because of that last shot being like i'll be waiting for you

07:55:14.300 --> 07:55:20.540
What's gonna happen is wait, wait, wait, they're actually becoming a jewel stop. I guess that the star

07:55:21.260 --> 07:55:23.260
I

07:55:25.020 --> 07:55:30.140
Was gonna say she'll slip in just as he's about to lose the fight and perish the blind man

07:55:34.860 --> 07:55:36.860
Kane

07:55:37.020 --> 07:55:39.020
Oh

07:55:49.980 --> 07:55:52.620
This is a very unlikely jewel it's not looking good

07:55:56.060 --> 07:56:00.860
Or I will yeah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay

07:56:40.860 --> 07:56:43.660
Oh, they never got to go on the father door date

07:56:48.860 --> 07:56:50.860

08:08:20.860 --> 08:08:22.860
Uh

08:08:35.260 --> 08:08:39.340
We either just made an ally or we just made an enemy

08:08:46.220 --> 08:08:48.220
No an enemy, okay

08:08:50.220 --> 08:08:52.220
In me

08:09:03.020 --> 08:09:07.500

You

Okay, hold on a minute, I might have been a little heasty I will admit I'm an absolute follower

08:21:26.780 --> 08:21:28.780
No, I'm not the flashbang

08:21:30.860 --> 08:21:36.860
I actually really like when the enemies become allies hold on they might redeem themselves

08:21:37.580 --> 08:21:43.180
The movie might have redeemed itself if the enemies become allies

08:21:45.580 --> 08:21:47.580
That is the only way

08:21:52.940 --> 08:21:58.700
Well, they party hard in germ- oh wait berlin raves are like known worldwide for how crazy they are

08:22:06.860 --> 08:22:08.860

Possible redemption arc I don't know I genuinely don't know how this movie is gonna swing

08:22:29.660 --> 08:22:31.660
Another rave continuing to go

08:22:37.180 --> 08:22:39.180
Oh

08:22:48.860 --> 08:22:51.980
You're gonna need a little more of that to keep it up

08:22:58.780 --> 08:23:00.780
Spine honed

08:23:07.660 --> 08:23:09.100
Wow

08:23:09.100 --> 08:23:14.540
Oh, come on. He's bled out a bit. He is not feeling good enough to be tossing me around like a rag doll

08:23:15.100 --> 08:23:17.740
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. That's my tie. That's my tie

08:23:20.060 --> 08:23:23.100

08:23:23.680 --> 08:23:25.680

No, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa

08:23:53.100 --> 08:24:05.920
What?

08:24:05.920 --> 08:24:12.440
Wow on air.

08:24:12.440 --> 08:24:20.820
You okay?

08:24:20.820 --> 08:24:48.260
Oh my god, that was me to a riflin, I may jump on you, wait is that an appropriate,

08:24:48.260 --> 08:24:50.060
can we do that convention?

08:25:18.260 --> 08:25:25.820
Like I know they said barrel and raves are crazy, but I think this is a bit more than I expected, I think we'll be honest.

08:25:25.820 --> 08:25:29.580
Stunny gets arrested for jumping on a riflin in public.

08:25:29.580 --> 08:25:36.700
Well you gonna press charges? You gonna press charges because I pressed against you huh?

08:25:48.260 --> 08:26:00.180
Let's try and end your program.

08:26:18.260 --> 08:26:30.660
God this guy has so much HP damage. Infinite health bar.

08:26:48.260 --> 08:26:55.460
So what's the deal?

08:27:18.260 --> 08:27:30.660
Bruh, meh, meh. Feels like we're going against Goliath here.

08:27:48.260 --> 08:27:50.260
Then I leave you in the hands of fate.

08:28:09.260 --> 08:28:14.260
What? Oh proof, proof of death.

08:28:19.260 --> 08:28:24.260
So what about our two non-alloy allies?

08:28:40.260 --> 08:28:44.260
There's far too much clothes being worn for an actual barrel and rave.

08:28:44.260 --> 08:28:48.260
That's all I'm gonna say, I have seen the outfits that come from these raves.

08:28:52.260 --> 08:28:54.260
No, no, no.

08:28:55.260 --> 08:28:57.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:28:59.260 --> 08:29:01.260
I forgot to say.

08:29:15.260 --> 08:29:18.260
Hmm?

08:29:20.260 --> 08:29:22.260
What?

08:29:22.260 --> 08:29:24.260
What?

08:29:38.260 --> 08:29:40.260
Bonjour.

08:29:40.260 --> 08:29:45.260
Pour-tu, Madame? Pour toi, désolé pour toi, Madame.

08:29:52.260 --> 08:29:54.260
Pour toi.

08:30:22.260 --> 08:30:34.260
Oh, 92 just popped, let's go.

08:30:36.260 --> 08:30:42.260
Yay, 92. Did they just get married? Something like that.

08:30:45.260 --> 08:30:48.260
Don't try this at home folks, no definitely not.

08:30:48.260 --> 08:30:50.260
Level 92.

08:30:53.260 --> 08:31:00.260
You're challenged.

08:31:08.260 --> 08:31:14.260
Winston is gonna be your nominee.

08:31:15.260 --> 08:31:20.260
Don't remind me, Emmy.

08:31:23.260 --> 08:31:28.260
I mean, we're at 33,000 jugs, honestly we're getting there.

08:31:28.260 --> 08:31:35.260
We really got 45,000 or something at the start, like we're gonna be in the 20s I think.

08:31:38.260 --> 08:31:40.260
You're welcome, LeMau.

08:31:41.260 --> 08:31:44.260
And game, Emmy.

08:31:46.260 --> 08:31:48.260
It's not the real Emmy.

08:31:53.260 --> 08:31:56.260
You're peeing as my daughter, are you?

08:32:03.260 --> 08:32:05.260
Hmm.

08:32:11.260 --> 08:32:13.260
Hmm.

08:32:17.260 --> 08:32:21.260
You're coping with a two week vacation.

08:32:21.260 --> 08:32:23.260
Hmm.

08:32:41.260 --> 08:32:45.260
Exactly, we have to deal with it.

08:32:52.260 --> 08:32:54.260
Hmm.

08:33:04.260 --> 08:33:06.260
Lance, who's Lance?

08:33:08.260 --> 08:33:10.260
Winston is Lance?

08:33:12.260 --> 08:33:14.260
Or Concierge is Lance?

08:33:21.260 --> 08:33:33.260
Oh, yeah, yeah, Concierge is. Sorry.

08:33:51.260 --> 08:33:53.260
Hmm.

08:34:01.260 --> 08:34:03.260
Hmm.

08:34:03.260 --> 08:34:05.260
Hmm.

08:34:17.260 --> 08:34:20.260
They're fun to the bosoms, right?

08:34:33.260 --> 08:34:35.260
Hmm.

08:34:54.260 --> 08:34:57.260
There it is, one man do it.

08:35:03.260 --> 08:35:05.260
Hmm.

08:35:16.260 --> 08:35:18.260
What?

08:35:18.260 --> 08:35:20.260
Hmm.

08:35:32.260 --> 08:35:36.260
I'll take my odds with Baba Yaga, I'm gonna be honest.

08:35:40.260 --> 08:35:42.260
Hmm.

08:35:43.260 --> 08:35:46.260
Winston is happy with the terms.

08:35:49.260 --> 08:35:51.260
Hmm.

08:35:53.260 --> 08:35:57.260
Important, Meaton, Ethel Turd in the background.

08:35:58.260 --> 08:36:01.260
I'll take those odds, yeah, I'm with you there.

08:36:07.260 --> 08:36:09.260
Nice and fresh.

08:36:10.260 --> 08:36:13.260
And I'm with the Triple Lusky.

08:36:14.260 --> 08:36:16.260
Hmm.

08:36:17.260 --> 08:36:23.260
Wait, it's a card, wait, Winston the Jewel, I thought it meant of combat, hold on a minute.

08:36:29.260 --> 08:36:32.260
It's a game of chance of chords?

08:36:33.260 --> 08:36:38.260
I thought it was physical combat, that's why I picked Baba Yaga.

08:36:43.260 --> 08:36:45.260
Hmm.

08:37:04.260 --> 08:37:06.260
What?

08:37:13.260 --> 08:37:25.260
Oh, they're picking and whoever has the highest number gets their choice.

08:37:25.260 --> 08:37:27.260
So is it combat?

08:37:37.260 --> 08:37:39.260
Blades.

08:37:44.260 --> 08:37:46.260
Pistolate.

08:37:47.260 --> 08:37:49.260
Ooh.

08:38:04.260 --> 08:38:07.260
Right, just paw of greed.

08:38:08.260 --> 08:38:14.260
Oh, cause you never change right, we get it, fourth installment.

08:38:14.260 --> 08:38:19.260
Ray, we get it, wrap it up, wrap it up, we get it, John Wick never changes, wrap it up.

08:38:19.260 --> 08:38:22.260
This is a fourth film in a row.

08:38:22.260 --> 08:38:24.260
Wrap it up.

08:38:24.260 --> 08:38:26.260
Ah.

08:38:35.260 --> 08:38:37.260
Four, why never changes?

08:38:47.260 --> 08:38:49.260
No quarter.

08:38:54.260 --> 08:38:56.260
Cain.

08:39:04.260 --> 08:39:06.260
Okay.

08:39:09.260 --> 08:39:12.260
I guess we aren't on an ally streak.

08:39:24.260 --> 08:39:26.260
Okay.

08:39:54.260 --> 08:39:56.260
Okay.

08:40:25.260 --> 08:40:27.260
Yes.

08:40:36.260 --> 08:40:40.260
He just wants to play Hotel Simulator, leave him be.

08:40:55.260 --> 08:41:00.260
Not like this.

08:41:11.260 --> 08:41:21.260
Unless, unless last minute we kill him, I don't know.

08:41:25.260 --> 08:41:30.260
In life last minute we kill him, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

08:41:32.260 --> 08:41:34.260
Oh, I don't know.

08:41:34.260 --> 08:41:37.260
I don't know how this film's gonna end.

08:41:37.260 --> 08:41:43.260
I originally thought we were literally going around the high table, getting all seven and going for it.

08:41:43.260 --> 08:41:46.260
But obviously that's not how you're supposed to do it.

08:41:46.260 --> 08:41:47.260
Pardon me.

08:41:47.260 --> 08:41:49.260
He wants to revive Havel Hotel.

08:41:49.260 --> 08:41:52.260
Apparently they came out with Old Havel Hotel.

08:41:52.260 --> 08:41:55.260
And everyone was like, yeah, you see it groomed on that website?

08:41:55.260 --> 08:41:59.260
Which is actually shot on, to be honest.

08:42:10.260 --> 08:42:14.260
Lighting a candle for our wife, Helen.

08:42:19.260 --> 08:42:21.260
Okay.

08:42:49.260 --> 08:42:51.260
Um.

08:43:00.260 --> 08:43:02.260
Kill's closed.

08:43:19.260 --> 08:43:21.260
No.

08:43:49.260 --> 08:43:51.260
Okay.

08:43:51.260 --> 08:43:53.260
Okay.

08:44:15.260 --> 08:44:18.260
I urge you to reconsider.

08:44:21.260 --> 08:44:23.260
Yeah.

08:44:34.260 --> 08:44:36.260
I miss you too, buddy.

08:44:42.260 --> 08:44:44.260
Goodbye, King.

08:44:52.260 --> 08:44:58.260
Uh, level 92.

08:45:00.260 --> 08:45:06.260
We're getting almost to 20,000 left over grapes and wine, so we're getting there.

08:45:21.260 --> 08:45:23.260
Okay.

08:45:46.260 --> 08:45:49.260
He says such ominous stuff.

08:45:49.260 --> 08:45:53.260
It's almost like that old man's not written for him, even though...

08:46:03.260 --> 08:46:05.260
Bonsoir.

08:46:05.260 --> 08:46:07.260
Salut. Bonsoir.

08:46:07.260 --> 08:46:09.260
Bonsoir.

08:46:17.260 --> 08:46:19.260
Merci.

08:46:19.260 --> 08:46:21.260
Merci. Bonsoir.

08:46:25.260 --> 08:46:27.260
Excuse-moi.

08:46:27.260 --> 08:46:31.260
Where is the man?

08:46:32.260 --> 08:46:35.260
That's how he does bro.

08:46:35.260 --> 08:46:40.260
Honestly, I feel like that old guy doesn't actually like the new kid.

08:46:40.260 --> 08:46:43.260
Like he wants the old ways.

08:46:43.260 --> 08:46:45.260
Bonsoir.

08:47:03.260 --> 08:47:05.260
Bonsoir.

08:47:07.260 --> 08:47:09.260
Salut.

08:47:14.260 --> 08:47:16.260
Salut.

08:47:29.260 --> 08:47:31.260
Where is he?

08:47:44.260 --> 08:47:47.260
Uh, any devours?

08:47:47.260 --> 08:47:49.260
Nope.

08:47:49.260 --> 08:47:52.260
He's got the glares- whoa, what's this?

08:47:54.260 --> 08:47:56.260
The math of the city?

08:48:13.260 --> 08:48:25.260
Uh, uh, he's wrong about that.

08:48:31.260 --> 08:48:38.260
Okay, maybe the blind man has more cars, but John Wick wants to kill so he can keep the memory of his wife, okay?

08:48:38.260 --> 08:48:41.260
So you're not correct, technically.

08:48:41.260 --> 08:48:43.260
Stinky Frenchman.

08:48:43.260 --> 08:48:45.260
P.E.U., go take a bath.

08:48:45.260 --> 08:48:47.260
You know?

08:48:47.260 --> 08:48:53.260
Put some odour toilet on, mate. You're absolutely giving me the book.

08:48:53.260 --> 08:48:59.260
Are we having a battle on the Eiffel Tower? On the big Eiffel Tower?

08:48:59.260 --> 08:49:02.260
Oh, inside the tower?

08:49:02.260 --> 08:49:05.260
Seek and destroy?

08:49:05.260 --> 08:49:07.260
Oh.

08:49:11.260 --> 08:49:15.260
We are making the high table sweat, holy crap.

08:49:41.260 --> 08:49:45.260
Hired for Gen 2 confirmed.

08:50:12.260 --> 08:50:14.260
P.E.U., go take a bath.

08:50:14.260 --> 08:50:40.660
That's called Psychological Warfare.

08:50:40.660 --> 08:51:06.260
Incinerate Armour?

08:51:06.260 --> 08:51:34.180
The movie's thrown me, I can't predict what's going to happen, it's all going to be over

08:51:34.180 --> 08:52:04.020
in an hour, then we're going to know.

08:52:04.740 --> 08:52:26.820
Fiberoptic internet on that thing, that thing does not hold 21 bills, I can tell you that

08:52:27.140 --> 08:52:43.300
right now, how few words does he actually say in this plot, he's using a heartbeat sensor, cheater,

08:52:43.300 --> 08:52:49.860
cheater, cheater, pumpkin ear, no we're taking a romantic stroll on the river, sea, was it

08:52:50.580 --> 08:52:55.460
sea air, sorry sea air, that's the accent on,

08:52:58.660 --> 08:53:01.300
I was a bit late for that, oh

08:53:12.100 --> 08:53:13.300
Mr. Concierge

08:53:20.820 --> 08:53:26.820
mm

08:53:43.140 --> 08:53:45.940
white right

08:53:49.860 --> 08:53:56.860
Good bye and good luck, Mr. Wick.

08:53:56.860 --> 08:54:03.860
Mon chance.

08:54:03.860 --> 08:54:14.860
No miss you.

08:54:14.860 --> 08:54:28.860
I'm not going to cry.

08:54:28.860 --> 08:54:29.860
Too frustrated.

08:54:29.860 --> 08:54:30.860
I'm not going to cry.

08:54:30.860 --> 08:54:32.860
Because I have no idea where this film is going.

08:54:32.860 --> 08:54:34.860
But I'm not going to cry.

08:54:34.860 --> 08:54:47.860
That was very sweet.

08:54:47.860 --> 08:55:10.860
No no, no cry, no cry.

08:55:10.860 --> 08:55:18.860
Wait, so how are they allowed to still go from even though he has a fight with a high table?

08:55:18.860 --> 08:55:47.860
All fades are black.

08:55:47.860 --> 08:56:12.860
I'm not going to cry.

08:56:12.860 --> 08:56:39.860
I'm not going to cry.

08:56:39.860 --> 08:57:04.860
I'm not going to cry.

08:57:04.860 --> 08:57:06.860
I'm level 96 now, strongy.

08:57:06.860 --> 08:57:12.860
Give me your account right now.

08:57:12.860 --> 08:57:23.860
Just a few more levels.

08:57:23.860 --> 08:57:27.860
Oh, they're actually thinking about shutting down the traffic because it's so bad here.

08:57:27.860 --> 08:57:29.860
Yes, mummy, here's my account.

08:57:29.860 --> 08:57:33.860
Stop.

08:57:33.860 --> 08:57:39.860
Oh my god, they wanted to shut it down because the John Wick's driving.

08:57:39.860 --> 08:57:40.860
What's that mean?

08:57:40.860 --> 08:57:51.860
I had a drink of cola.

08:57:51.860 --> 08:57:52.860
Wait, nice noise.

08:57:52.860 --> 08:57:55.860
What?

08:57:55.860 --> 08:57:59.860
Is my camp young?

08:57:59.860 --> 08:58:01.860
Did I fart and not mute?

08:58:01.860 --> 08:58:02.860
Hold on, what noise?

08:58:02.860 --> 08:58:03.860
You're making me nervous.

08:58:03.860 --> 08:58:09.860
Did I fart and not mute?

08:58:09.860 --> 08:58:11.860
You made a funny snorty noise.

08:58:11.860 --> 08:58:14.860
Did I fart?

08:58:14.860 --> 08:58:16.860
Oh my god.

08:58:16.860 --> 08:58:22.860
I did drink of cola.

08:58:22.860 --> 08:58:24.860
You made a funny noise?

08:58:24.860 --> 08:58:25.860
I don't even remember.

08:58:25.860 --> 08:58:26.860
I drank cola.

08:58:26.860 --> 08:58:29.860
Maybe it got stuck on the way down.

08:58:29.860 --> 08:58:31.860
It wasn't a breath.

08:58:31.860 --> 08:58:33.860
Close, close no cigar.

08:58:33.860 --> 08:58:35.860
I didn't even know what noise I made.

08:58:55.860 --> 08:59:16.860
If you've seen it and you've seen it and you know you want to go to Tokyo.

08:59:16.860 --> 08:59:31.860
I can't.

08:59:31.860 --> 08:59:38.860
Well, we're actually getting praised in real time.

08:59:38.860 --> 08:59:59.860
Me, mommy, me, I'm the big winner.

08:59:59.860 --> 09:00:25.860
Is this Skrillex?

09:00:25.860 --> 09:00:29.860
And maybe my stomach making a noise because I've not eaten since the past though.

09:00:29.860 --> 09:00:35.860
But I'm not really that hungry.

09:00:35.860 --> 09:01:04.860
My spine.

09:01:04.860 --> 09:01:32.860
My stomach.

09:01:33.860 --> 09:01:42.860
Are you okay, sir?

09:01:42.860 --> 09:01:43.860
Oh, then again, they have guns.

09:01:43.860 --> 09:01:49.860
I wouldn't get out of the car if someone's got guns and I ran somewhere and saws.

09:01:49.860 --> 09:02:01.860
Can't stop, won't stop.

09:02:01.860 --> 09:02:14.860
Friend or foe, question mark.

09:02:14.860 --> 09:02:16.860
I don't, I don't get the angle.

09:02:16.860 --> 09:02:19.860
I think he's going to turn into a friend.

09:02:19.860 --> 09:02:46.860
Because they don't pay him and he's pissed at his hand.

09:02:46.860 --> 09:02:51.860
You know the classic Citroen car, I've forgotten the name of it.

09:02:51.860 --> 09:03:00.860
Oh, it might have been my feet on the seat.

09:03:00.860 --> 09:03:07.860
He wants the bounty so he's going to keep him alive.

09:03:08.860 --> 09:03:12.860
There's a French saying, I actually forgot the word.

09:03:12.860 --> 09:03:20.860
Is it bullion? No, bullion soup.

09:03:20.860 --> 09:03:23.860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:03:23.860 --> 09:03:24.860
Okay, yeah, yeah, that's right.

09:03:24.860 --> 09:03:25.860
Walk off, walk off.

09:03:25.860 --> 09:03:27.860
Walk off, you're fine, you're fine.

09:03:27.860 --> 09:03:30.860
God, these movies cannot get away from like harm and animals.

09:03:30.860 --> 09:03:31.860
Like relax.

09:03:31.860 --> 09:03:34.860
I don't know who wrote the scripts, but y'all need to calm down.

09:03:34.860 --> 09:03:58.860
So someone needs their like hard drive check for like some weirds going on at John Wick headquarters.

09:03:58.860 --> 09:04:01.860
That dog literally build different for real.

09:04:01.860 --> 09:04:02.860
It's a cyborg.

09:04:02.860 --> 09:04:20.860
And that's why it's fine.

09:04:20.860 --> 09:04:21.860
Oh, I like that.

09:04:21.860 --> 09:04:22.860
That was unique.

09:04:50.860 --> 09:05:07.860
Dude, you just shot that guy in the dick, dude.

09:05:07.860 --> 09:05:09.860
Dude, what's wrong?

09:05:09.860 --> 09:05:17.860
You just shot that guy in the dick.

09:05:17.860 --> 09:05:19.860
What the fuck?

09:05:19.860 --> 09:05:20.860
What the fuck?

09:05:20.860 --> 09:05:21.860
What the fuck?

09:05:21.860 --> 09:05:22.860
What the fuck?

09:05:22.860 --> 09:05:23.860
What the fuck?

09:05:23.860 --> 09:05:24.860
What the fuck?

09:05:24.860 --> 09:05:25.860
What the fuck?

09:05:25.860 --> 09:05:26.860
What the fuck?

09:05:26.860 --> 09:05:27.860
What the fuck?

09:05:27.860 --> 09:05:28.860
What the fuck?

09:05:28.860 --> 09:05:56.860
What the fuck?

09:05:56.860 --> 09:05:57.860
Hey, Kigtmin.

09:05:57.860 --> 09:05:58.860
Is that you?

09:05:58.860 --> 09:06:00.860
Any get, dude?

09:06:00.860 --> 09:06:03.860
Oh, what's the deal?

09:06:03.860 --> 09:06:14.860
Yeah, that was before you stabbed me in the hand weirdo.

09:06:14.860 --> 09:06:29.340
Oh, it's backpack spiller proof!

09:06:29.340 --> 09:06:32.540
Ehh!

09:06:32.540 --> 09:06:39.660
Okay, that was cool.

09:06:40.620 --> 09:06:44.620
Ehh!

09:06:44.620 --> 09:06:48.620
Oh my god, it's about to background.

09:06:48.620 --> 09:06:54.620
God, I have so much brain roll with that game right now.

09:06:54.620 --> 09:07:02.620
Qua.

09:07:03.580 --> 09:07:09.580
Daco.

09:07:09.580 --> 09:07:17.580
Okay, so now he's not friend blue.

09:07:18.540 --> 09:07:34.540
I love how he now has to use a wireless old timey phone, literally.

09:07:34.540 --> 09:07:42.540
Oh, how else would they make the servant get their money's worth out of the servants?

09:07:42.540 --> 09:07:58.540
BOO! Incider amul!

09:08:02.540 --> 09:08:06.540
Wuuohhh!

09:08:06.540 --> 09:08:14.540
Oh my god visually that's insane but I guess it highlights the pellet spread

09:08:14.540 --> 09:08:17.540
against the shotgun.

09:08:23.540 --> 09:08:29.540
I'm liking this like perspective as well.

09:08:31.540 --> 09:08:35.540
This definitely feels different.

09:08:36.540 --> 09:08:54.540
You know what, uh, Hotline Miami.

09:08:59.540 --> 09:09:02.540
Hotline Miami, that's why.

09:09:06.540 --> 09:09:22.540
Even the soundtrack, hold on a minute, did they just kinda go Hotline Miami this soon?

09:09:31.540 --> 09:09:34.540
Right, no fall.

09:09:36.540 --> 09:09:38.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:38.540 --> 09:09:40.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:40.540 --> 09:09:42.540

09:09:42.540 --> 09:09:44.540

09:09:44.540 --> 09:09:46.540

09:09:46.540 --> 09:09:48.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:48.540 --> 09:09:50.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:50.540 --> 09:09:52.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:52.540 --> 09:09:54.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:54.540 --> 09:09:56.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:56.540 --> 09:09:58.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:09:58.540 --> 09:10:00.540
You know what I'm saying?

09:10:16.540 --> 09:10:18.540
Okay.

09:10:20.540 --> 09:10:22.540
Okay.

09:10:22.540 --> 09:10:47.120
What, the Doug's not hostile anymore?

09:10:47.120 --> 09:10:50.880
The Doug's occupied, alright.

09:10:50.880 --> 09:10:52.880
He's away for a wee snack, breaking a wee water.

09:11:20.880 --> 09:11:22.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:22.880 --> 09:11:24.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:24.880 --> 09:11:26.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:26.880 --> 09:11:28.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:28.880 --> 09:11:30.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:30.880 --> 09:11:32.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:32.880 --> 09:11:34.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:34.880 --> 09:11:36.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:36.880 --> 09:11:38.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:38.880 --> 09:11:40.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:40.880 --> 09:11:42.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:42.880 --> 09:11:44.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:44.880 --> 09:11:46.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:46.880 --> 09:11:48.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:48.880 --> 09:11:50.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:50.880 --> 09:11:52.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:52.880 --> 09:11:54.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:54.880 --> 09:11:56.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:56.880 --> 09:11:58.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:11:58.880 --> 09:12:00.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:00.880 --> 09:12:02.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:02.880 --> 09:12:04.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:04.880 --> 09:12:06.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:06.880 --> 09:12:08.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:08.880 --> 09:12:10.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:10.880 --> 09:12:12.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:12.880 --> 09:12:14.880
The Doug's not hostile anymore.

09:12:14.880 --> 09:12:42.540
I

09:12:42.540 --> 09:12:48.780
like the almost commentary of a foxy they actually says oh clap trap would be crying

09:12:53.580 --> 09:12:54.140
still playing

09:12:54.140 --> 09:13:08.860
oh he's so so oh now hold on a minute part wait

09:13:24.140 --> 09:13:46.620
I don't know if this is a woman moment but we've been we've been at this for a

09:13:46.620 --> 09:13:50.780
bit we get it can we get to the location to do the plot we're kind of

09:13:51.180 --> 09:13:58.540
quest continuously right now so our last side quest unlocked a secret ally that was

09:13:58.540 --> 09:14:04.300
originally wanting to get us okay I understand but can we you know get to the location I get it

09:14:04.300 --> 09:14:10.780
we're under attack but come on I was still got another half an hour that's fine because the

09:14:10.780 --> 09:14:19.900
plot I guess is gonna pick up but yeah damn I don't know if it's a woman moment but

09:14:20.860 --> 09:14:26.220
you know you gotta get me something to bite into other than pew pew I will admit the hotline

09:14:26.220 --> 09:14:43.580
Miami scene was good because they did something very different but now don't get me wrong I

09:14:43.580 --> 09:14:47.500
understand it's explaining that he's such an unstoppable force

09:14:52.300 --> 09:14:52.540
but

09:14:55.660 --> 09:14:59.500
and the henchmen ain't gonna perish themselves I know but I'm like come on

09:15:01.660 --> 09:15:05.820
if you're gonna be like oh he's under a timer let's not do a billion side quest then huh

09:15:05.820 --> 09:15:12.060
oh

09:15:35.820 --> 09:15:38.820
Uuughh.

09:15:59.820 --> 09:16:02.820
Killing my patience as well.

09:16:02.820 --> 09:16:06.820
Like, I do get the emphasis that he's like such a bad un-

09:16:06.820 --> 09:16:09.820
like, you just kinda kill him type thing.

09:16:10.820 --> 09:16:14.820
Please, get into that. Just teleport there at this point.

09:16:14.820 --> 09:16:19.820
Just no clip through the damn walls and stuff at this point. Please.

09:16:19.820 --> 09:16:23.820
I am on my knees. Give me a bit more plot. Give me a bit more of a plot.

09:16:23.820 --> 09:16:25.820
Go on, give me a plot. Yeah-

09:16:25.820 --> 09:16:29.820
Aaaaaaah! Please! Yeah!

09:16:29.820 --> 09:16:31.820
Awww.

09:16:33.820 --> 09:16:34.820
Oh, for-

09:16:38.820 --> 09:16:42.820
I am sure this is supposed to be a humorous gag, but...

09:16:59.820 --> 09:17:06.820
I get it's supposed to be a humorous gag. It would be humorous if the scenes weren't-

09:17:06.820 --> 09:17:10.820
had- the combat hadn't gone on for like a solid 40 minutes.

09:17:10.820 --> 09:17:13.820
Oh, and of course he doesn't make it in time. What a surprise.

09:17:13.820 --> 09:17:16.820
So they cheated.

09:17:16.820 --> 09:17:22.100
weren't had the combat hadn't gone on for like a solid 40 minutes oh and of

09:17:22.100 --> 09:17:25.540
course he doesn't make it in time what's prize

09:17:32.940 --> 09:17:36.060
so they cheated

09:17:36.420 --> 09:17:48.740
wait Kane isn't there either it's up but Kane

09:17:52.060 --> 09:17:57.780
wait they're both lay on he's lay on purpose or something

09:18:07.060 --> 09:18:15.780
yes mr. Kane thank you mr. Kane

09:18:22.700 --> 09:18:28.620
that stunt double I hope he got paid his weight in gold for that staircase scene

09:18:28.620 --> 09:18:33.580
because those are like so dangerous and especially with the outfit that John

09:18:33.580 --> 09:18:39.180
Wick is assigned he's so skinny Malinky in such an outfit that the padding the

09:18:39.180 --> 09:18:43.620
stunt double receives has to be

09:19:04.580 --> 09:19:10.540
I am so confused where this movie is going

09:19:12.620 --> 09:19:18.660
like aren't they about to fight each other in literally two minutes time

09:19:18.660 --> 09:19:35.060
mmm co-op mode literally they've just swapped from single-player to co-op

09:19:39.140 --> 09:19:44.620
and they're very odd friends indeed

09:19:48.720 --> 09:19:50.720
I

09:19:56.600 --> 09:19:58.600
off

09:19:58.600 --> 09:20:21.640
Kiana raced at all his own stuns?

09:20:21.640 --> 09:20:22.640
Is he crazy?

09:20:22.640 --> 09:20:29.640
Oh for fuck's sake the poker table allies are all coming together.

09:20:29.640 --> 09:20:38.640
The dog's judging him, the dog said come on he saved me.

09:20:38.640 --> 09:20:56.640
I'm not, but he can.

09:20:57.640 --> 09:21:24.640
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:21:24.640 --> 09:21:31.640
I wondered why they focused.

09:21:31.640 --> 09:21:38.640
Hi Popper.

09:21:38.640 --> 09:21:41.640
You're one of them aren't ya?

09:21:41.640 --> 09:22:10.640
I thought it was a girl puppy.

09:22:10.640 --> 09:22:15.640
Oh did he just work me?

09:22:15.640 --> 09:22:16.640
You mind?

09:22:16.640 --> 09:22:20.640
How long it took me to get here?

09:22:20.640 --> 09:22:25.640
That hurt.

09:22:25.640 --> 09:22:28.640
That was my shooting hand.

09:22:28.640 --> 09:22:41.640
You imagine a random tourist walking past being like drunk as shit, what, seeing this?

09:22:41.640 --> 09:22:49.640
Peeler, the Peeler dog honestly.

09:22:49.640 --> 09:23:02.640
We made it somehow, every just little.

09:23:02.640 --> 09:23:04.640
Aw.

09:23:32.640 --> 09:23:53.640
Ha, no way, consequences.

09:23:53.640 --> 09:24:14.640
Hey, I like that billet detail.

09:24:14.640 --> 09:24:24.640
More billets coming off of them.

09:24:24.640 --> 09:24:29.640
I thought it was a girl cause she went oh good girl like way earlier.

09:24:29.640 --> 09:24:33.640
Or she, maybe I just made that up.

09:24:33.640 --> 09:24:35.640
Me, I'm the dog all along.

09:25:03.640 --> 09:25:06.640
You

09:25:33.640 --> 09:25:35.640
You

09:26:03.640 --> 09:26:05.640
You

09:26:33.640 --> 09:26:35.640
You

09:26:47.640 --> 09:26:52.640
Everyone hates the high table.

09:26:52.640 --> 09:26:59.640
What if we agreed to shoot each other in the shoulder and no one dies?

09:26:59.640 --> 09:27:09.640
Wait what if we can't just ever do this shit?

09:27:09.640 --> 09:27:21.640
Can we can't just ever do this like really quick?

09:27:21.640 --> 09:27:23.640
Wait how many, we only have two billets.

09:27:23.640 --> 09:27:24.640
How many guards?

09:27:24.640 --> 09:27:26.640
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

09:27:26.640 --> 09:27:38.640
I have hope and then nine for the bad guy cause the old man doesn't want this.

09:27:38.640 --> 09:27:46.640
No, he missed on purpose.

09:27:46.640 --> 09:27:54.640
They both missed on purpose.

09:27:54.640 --> 09:28:00.640
Fuck.

09:28:00.640 --> 09:28:06.640
Okay, give us another cheeky billet then.

09:28:06.640 --> 09:28:09.640
Cause you only gave us one.

09:28:09.640 --> 09:28:14.640
Thank you.

09:28:14.640 --> 09:28:16.640
Please, Katniss, everything this.

09:28:16.640 --> 09:28:33.640
I'm gonna go fucking way older so you can't, Katniss, everything this.

09:28:33.640 --> 09:28:35.640
One, nine.

09:28:45.640 --> 09:28:52.640
No.

09:29:06.640 --> 09:29:10.640
Come on, King.

09:29:10.640 --> 09:29:22.640
No, he can't walk steady.

09:29:22.640 --> 09:29:29.640
Your enemy is my enemy.

09:29:29.640 --> 09:29:31.640
Your enemy is my enemy.

09:29:31.640 --> 09:29:44.640
Come on.

09:29:44.640 --> 09:29:46.640
And who is him?

09:29:46.640 --> 09:29:48.640
Come on, who is him?

09:29:59.640 --> 09:30:17.640
Come on.

09:30:17.640 --> 09:30:19.640
Oh man, please.

09:30:47.640 --> 09:31:13.640
Come on.

09:31:13.640 --> 09:31:15.640
They're finishing me with the final moves.

09:31:15.640 --> 09:31:44.640
Oh, come on.

09:31:44.640 --> 09:31:48.640
Anyone.

09:31:48.640 --> 09:31:57.640
He never saw.

09:31:57.640 --> 09:32:07.640
Wait, the guards don't care.

09:32:07.640 --> 09:32:27.640
The guards to the elder guy, I guess?

09:32:27.640 --> 09:32:29.640
All he had to do was shoot, I guess?

09:32:29.640 --> 09:32:37.640
That was in the rules of the marathons and...

09:32:37.640 --> 09:32:42.640
Oh.

09:32:42.640 --> 09:32:49.640
A still illegal move?

09:33:13.640 --> 09:33:17.640
Can we get like an ambulance or something?

09:33:17.640 --> 09:33:21.640
You know, should you give it a medical assistance here and there?

09:33:21.640 --> 09:33:27.640
A few gauze if you've got it.

09:33:27.640 --> 09:33:33.640
You know, maybe a pump of O-negative blood if anyone's got O-negative.

09:33:33.640 --> 09:33:36.640
Yeah.

09:34:12.640 --> 09:34:21.640
Again, you persist, Mr. Wick.

09:34:21.640 --> 09:34:36.640
Against all odds.

09:34:36.640 --> 09:34:39.640
Oh.

09:34:39.640 --> 09:34:43.640
He doesn't think he's gonna make it.

09:34:43.640 --> 09:34:47.640
Spoilers, there's a five in production, thank god.

09:34:47.640 --> 09:34:50.640
Oh wait, no, sorry, he just means like actually take me to New York.

09:34:50.640 --> 09:34:53.640
Sorry, sorry, forgot what country they're in.

09:34:53.640 --> 09:34:55.640
Hold on a minute, they're in France.

09:34:55.640 --> 09:34:59.640
Hold on a minute, didn't think that one through.

09:34:59.640 --> 09:35:01.640
Wait.

09:35:01.640 --> 09:35:02.640
Oh no, he does think he's dying.

09:35:02.640 --> 09:35:07.640
Hold on, I spoke too soon, but thankfully there is John Wick 5 in production.

09:35:07.640 --> 09:35:12.640
Okay, my apologies, not only did I ruin that, reversed it, then did it twice.

09:35:12.640 --> 09:35:16.640
Okay, I take it back, there's a John Wick 5 coming.

09:35:16.640 --> 09:35:19.640
But he thinks he's dying, but he can't.

09:35:19.640 --> 09:35:22.640
There's a John Wick 5.

09:35:22.640 --> 09:35:28.640
And if you're telling me that Osaka chick is John Wick 5, no, no, no, no.

09:35:28.640 --> 09:35:29.640
Not at all.

09:35:29.640 --> 09:35:30.640
Not at all.

09:35:30.640 --> 09:35:31.640
Not at all.

09:35:31.640 --> 09:35:32.640
Not at all.

09:35:32.640 --> 09:35:33.640
Not at all.

09:35:33.640 --> 09:35:34.640
Not at all.

09:35:34.640 --> 09:35:35.640
Not at all.

09:35:35.640 --> 09:35:36.640
Not at all.

09:35:36.640 --> 09:35:37.640
Not at all.

09:35:37.640 --> 09:35:38.640
Not at all.

09:35:38.640 --> 09:35:39.640
Not at all.

09:35:39.640 --> 09:35:40.640
Not at all.

09:35:40.640 --> 09:35:41.640
Not at all.

09:35:41.640 --> 09:35:42.640
Not at all.

09:35:42.640 --> 09:35:43.640
Not at all.

09:35:43.640 --> 09:35:44.640
Not at all.

09:35:44.640 --> 09:35:45.640
Not at all.

09:35:45.640 --> 09:35:46.640
Not at all.

09:35:46.640 --> 09:35:47.640
Not at all.

09:35:47.640 --> 09:35:48.640
Not at all.

09:35:48.640 --> 09:35:49.640
Not at all.

09:35:49.640 --> 09:35:50.640
Not at all.

09:35:50.640 --> 09:35:51.640
Not at all.

09:35:51.640 --> 09:35:52.640
Not at all.

09:35:52.640 --> 09:35:53.640
Not at all.

09:35:54.640 --> 09:35:55.640
Not at all.

09:36:08.640 --> 09:36:09.640
Bro, you ain't passing away.

09:36:09.640 --> 09:36:11.640
John Wick 5 is a thing.

09:36:11.640 --> 09:36:14.640
You're not him, bro!

09:36:17.640 --> 09:36:21.640
Absolutely rigged and dirty.

09:36:21.640 --> 09:36:25.640
Thank God you guys spoiled. There's a whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:36:40.920 --> 09:36:41.920
Question mark.

09:36:45.400 --> 09:36:47.480
For once in my life, question mark.

09:36:51.880 --> 09:36:52.380
Huh?

09:36:54.080 --> 09:36:54.580
Huh?

09:36:57.320 --> 09:37:00.040
Motherfucker, you said there was a five.

09:37:03.560 --> 09:37:04.060
Hello?

09:37:18.800 --> 09:37:20.000
That's fake, right?

09:37:22.240 --> 09:37:22.740
What?

09:37:25.840 --> 09:37:26.340
What?

09:37:29.440 --> 09:37:29.940
Whoa!

09:37:34.840 --> 09:37:36.240
No, he's still alive.

09:37:49.080 --> 09:37:49.580
Whoa!

09:37:51.640 --> 09:38:01.640
No, he's like, hidden behind a tree, right? And he's not really dead.

09:38:03.240 --> 09:38:06.040
You said there was a John Wick five.

09:38:08.540 --> 09:38:11.240
I know he's buried beside his way.

09:38:15.440 --> 09:38:18.240
You told me there was a John Wick five.

09:38:19.240 --> 09:38:21.840
He's like behind a tree, right?

09:38:24.840 --> 09:38:26.840
Is he not behind a tree?

09:38:31.040 --> 09:38:34.840
Wait, whoa! Why would you do that to me?

09:38:34.840 --> 09:38:37.440
There's no, like, after-sync credit.

09:38:39.840 --> 09:38:43.440
There's no evidence that he actually died!

09:38:44.440 --> 09:38:45.440
No!

09:38:45.440 --> 09:38:46.440
Whoa!

09:38:48.840 --> 09:38:49.840
Whoa!

09:38:51.040 --> 09:38:53.440
I'm, like, laughing and crying.

09:38:53.440 --> 09:38:56.440
He actually fucking died!

09:38:58.440 --> 09:38:59.640
He fucking-

09:39:00.840 --> 09:39:02.640
Wait, are you serious?

09:39:04.840 --> 09:39:08.640
Why is he actually dead after all of that?

09:39:10.840 --> 09:39:11.840
Wait, whoa!

09:39:14.640 --> 09:39:17.240
No, he's gone into the credits.

09:39:18.640 --> 09:39:21.440
I don't think there's a posting credit!

09:39:21.440 --> 09:39:22.840
Is he dead?

09:39:25.440 --> 09:39:26.840
Is he actually dead?

09:39:27.440 --> 09:39:30.440
Oh, wait, there's a posting credit! What the fuck are you doing? Stop!

09:39:30.440 --> 09:39:31.840
Skip to the end!

09:39:31.840 --> 09:39:34.640
Skip to the end! There's a posting credit!

09:39:35.440 --> 09:39:39.040
I'm gonna throw up! I'm gonna throw up!

09:39:39.040 --> 09:39:40.440
There's a posting-

09:39:40.440 --> 09:39:41.040
Wait, go-

09:39:42.840 --> 09:39:44.040
Go to the end!

09:39:45.840 --> 09:39:46.840
Stop!

09:39:48.440 --> 09:39:53.240
No, I don't think Sol is in the fact that he can see his daughter again!

09:39:53.840 --> 09:39:55.240
No!

09:39:57.240 --> 09:39:58.240
Stop!

09:39:59.840 --> 09:40:01.640
Why did you kill him?

09:40:06.040 --> 09:40:10.440
No! The fucking Osaka bitch killed him! No!

09:40:11.040 --> 09:40:12.240
Why?

09:40:12.240 --> 09:40:15.240
No, no, no, no, no, no!

09:40:16.240 --> 09:40:19.440
No, no, it makes it so much worse!

09:40:19.440 --> 09:40:21.440
No!

09:40:24.440 --> 09:40:27.440
I can't believe we're in Skip anymore!

09:40:28.840 --> 09:40:31.440
What the fuck is this?

09:40:33.440 --> 09:40:36.440
You told me there was a five!

09:40:36.440 --> 09:40:39.440
I believed you!

09:40:39.440 --> 09:40:43.440
And he doesn't get to see his daughter!

09:40:43.640 --> 09:40:45.640
I'm fucking distraught!

09:40:45.640 --> 09:40:48.640
How am I supposed to make way?

09:40:48.640 --> 09:40:50.640
An edge mill!

09:40:52.640 --> 09:40:53.640
Oh my god!

09:40:54.640 --> 09:40:56.640
What the fuck?

09:40:57.640 --> 09:41:01.640
I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm sweating, but what the fuck?

09:41:05.640 --> 09:41:07.640
He actually dies!

09:41:07.640 --> 09:41:10.640
I thought I was being so fucking cocky in this scene!

09:41:10.840 --> 09:41:15.840
He's fine, just get him some O-negative blood, he's fine!

09:41:16.840 --> 09:41:21.840
Oh yeah, just taking me back to New York, I can't be arsed driving the plane myself!

09:41:23.840 --> 09:41:30.840
And then fucking Kane McGee doesn't even get to see his daughter!

09:41:32.840 --> 09:41:35.840
Who the fuck wrote that script?

09:41:36.840 --> 09:41:40.840
What a horrible person you are to lay waste to that!

09:41:40.840 --> 09:41:43.840
Why would you create something like that?

09:41:45.840 --> 09:41:47.840
Why?

09:41:47.840 --> 09:41:50.840
Why can't we have happy endings?

09:41:50.840 --> 09:41:54.840
Is it too much to ask for happy endings?

09:41:57.840 --> 09:41:59.840
Do we know what's in John Wick 5?

09:41:59.840 --> 09:42:06.840
Please tell me they fucking cloned him, and he's the first human clone, and he's still him.

09:42:06.840 --> 09:42:09.840
And they clone his wife, and then they go on dates and stuff.

09:42:09.840 --> 09:42:16.840
I would just watch that to be honest, they catch up and do the work and stuff together.

09:42:18.840 --> 09:42:21.840
Nothing is known about fire, okay?

09:42:22.840 --> 09:42:24.840
Is that a prequel?

09:42:24.840 --> 09:42:27.840
I'm fucking cheating, hold on, I'm looking up the prequel.

09:42:27.840 --> 09:42:31.840
I'm looking up on ID, NBM, Elemental P or whatever the fuck it is.

09:42:36.840 --> 09:42:39.840
Oh my god, what one is it? What one's the game?

09:42:40.840 --> 09:42:42.840
I don't know, hold on.

09:42:42.840 --> 09:42:46.840
It's like a fucking browser source or something.

09:42:47.840 --> 09:42:49.840
Oh, I'm gonna be sick!

09:42:49.840 --> 09:42:58.840
I don't know, is John Wick in the fucking ID Elemental P website where it's like, oh this is who this actor is in this?

09:43:01.840 --> 09:43:05.840
They are thinking about how to revive him, they fucking better.

09:43:05.840 --> 09:43:08.840
Sorry, they better put a defibrillator on his corpse and dig it up and shit.

09:43:08.840 --> 09:43:13.840
But tell me he's behind a tree right now, and they just had to do that for sure.

09:43:15.840 --> 09:43:17.840
He actually dies.

09:43:18.840 --> 09:43:20.840
Why the fuck did we watch that?

09:43:20.840 --> 09:43:24.840
Why did I put that on? I thought he was, he can't be killed.

09:43:26.840 --> 09:43:38.840
Keep in mind we just saw him collapse, he was like, well, I don't know, considering the gravestone said what he wanted the gravestone to say, like, saw us, but I'm a doubter.

09:43:42.840 --> 09:43:43.840
I'm a doubter.

09:43:44.840 --> 09:43:46.840
He actually dies, what the fuck.

09:43:48.840 --> 09:43:52.840
He's not behind a tree, he's actually in a farm. That makes no sense.

09:43:54.840 --> 09:43:57.840
The ending just teases what happens with Cain.

09:43:57.840 --> 09:43:59.840
Oh, I don't care about Cain.

09:43:59.840 --> 09:44:08.840
I mean, I do that he sees his daughter, but I don't have the patience to go through another movie to be like, I finally get to see my daughter.

09:44:12.840 --> 09:44:15.840
They are keeping, yeah.

09:44:18.840 --> 09:44:21.840
And he gets to be with his wife and Daisy.

09:44:23.840 --> 09:44:28.840
I was being so fucking cocky because she told me there was a five that he couldn't die.

09:44:28.840 --> 09:44:33.840
I was like, yeah, no, he can just take all the damage because it's fine, he's coming up in five.

09:44:36.840 --> 09:44:38.840
Oh my god.

09:44:40.840 --> 09:44:42.840
All I do is cry.

09:44:43.840 --> 09:44:55.840
All I do is cry, these are supposed to be action pu pu movies, and I put them on because I'm like, oh, it's gonna be like Transformers, all cool and stuff, yeah, let's do that, they're so cool, yeah, action movies.

09:44:59.840 --> 09:45:06.840
They can't even call it John Wick 5 without Big Johnny Boy being there, so he is hiding behind a tree like a fanny, honestly.

09:45:07.840 --> 09:45:12.840
Literally, he's away grinning to himself being like, they got a wee gravestone of me.

09:45:14.840 --> 09:45:18.840
He's actually just raising an army, clearly.

09:45:19.840 --> 09:45:21.840
Can we watch Cool Family?

09:45:21.840 --> 09:45:25.840
Yeah, next time we watch something, it's gonna have to be something easy.

09:45:25.840 --> 09:45:31.840
My body's literally shaking right now because I'm so emotionally distraught after that.

09:45:32.840 --> 09:45:43.840
And before the fifth one's a prequel, I think it's probably gonna be because, yeah, I don't see why he would be hiding behind a tree, Avengers style.

09:45:47.840 --> 09:45:49.840
Bring him back like Robocop.

09:45:49.840 --> 09:45:57.840
It could be him after four, it could be a prequel about his tale of how he became, that's probably the...

09:45:58.840 --> 09:46:00.840
Because, yeah.

09:46:01.840 --> 09:46:03.840
Because why would you show a gravestone?

09:46:03.840 --> 09:46:06.840
And it literally had the words on it.

09:46:06.840 --> 09:46:10.840
And fucking Big Winston said goodbye to us and shit.

09:46:12.840 --> 09:46:16.840
Is there John Wick 5 stars and he's sitting on a bench eating a sandwich?

09:46:16.840 --> 09:46:18.840
Literally I'd sit and watch that, so I would.

09:46:19.840 --> 09:46:26.840
John Wick tries to get back into a regular 9-5 and he's working at Starbucks and he can't handle the rush orders.

09:46:26.840 --> 09:46:33.840
And he doesn't understand when someone orders 12 sugar pump how much they're killing themselves with the drink.

09:46:33.840 --> 09:46:41.840
And he gets really mad because every time someone orders a drink, that one drink alone is his one hour wage because of how bad wages are.

09:46:42.840 --> 09:46:44.840
Mm, okay, yeah, I'd watch that.

09:46:44.840 --> 09:46:51.840
Okay, I take solace in the fact that I can see him in a Starbucks apron right now in a little Starbucks hat, repping it with his long hair.

09:46:51.840 --> 09:46:53.840
Mm, yeah, okay.

09:46:53.840 --> 09:46:55.840
Copium, copium.

09:46:55.840 --> 09:46:57.840
Counterpoint Palpatine.

09:46:57.840 --> 09:47:02.840
That was rubbish in Star Wars, well, am I right?

09:47:02.840 --> 09:47:07.840
Um, I'm gonna need a big old sleep after that one.

09:47:07.840 --> 09:47:09.840
Oh, no, that's wine.

09:47:09.840 --> 09:47:11.840
Oh my god.

09:47:13.840 --> 09:47:17.840
I can't believe that, why would anyone write that?

09:47:17.840 --> 09:47:19.840
Why would anyone do that?

09:47:20.840 --> 09:47:31.840
Is the IBDM or whatever that website up for John Wick 5, if it is, can you say if the female Helen is in it?

09:47:31.840 --> 09:47:38.840
If the female Helen is proven to be in the cast, we know it's a prequel because she isn't supposed to move.

09:47:38.840 --> 09:47:43.840
She doesn't move in the picture, so she doesn't get credit for being Helen.

09:47:43.840 --> 09:47:50.840
It's, here is 6am, how am I supposed to sleep?

09:47:50.840 --> 09:47:54.840
They could do a cop out and have it be someone else's funeral.

09:47:54.840 --> 09:47:57.840
But why, what would that do?

09:47:57.840 --> 09:48:07.840
That's the worst point, is that he got completely pardoned and could go back to the life, well, he had in quotation marks.

09:48:09.840 --> 09:48:15.840
But that was the whole point, he had just achieved that life and then he perished right after it.

09:48:17.840 --> 09:48:19.840
Bro, what?

09:48:20.840 --> 09:48:27.840
Bro, I'm going to have to play Belchow tomorrow to cheer me up, because what the fuck?

09:48:27.840 --> 09:48:35.840
There's no official cast list yet, man, I hate that website, elementopimbdm.com or whatever it is.

09:48:35.840 --> 09:48:41.840
It doesn't say anything about the plot or the actors.

09:48:41.840 --> 09:48:48.840
The Continental is a series about Winston from 2023, any chance we're going to watch that?

09:48:49.840 --> 09:48:54.840
Is this after 4? Like, the Continental has been restored?

09:48:54.840 --> 09:49:01.840
Every time I say Continental, I think of Ice Age Continental Drift, I don't even think I've watched it, but yeah.

09:49:01.840 --> 09:49:05.840
And we need some Gamber to cheer up my brain again.

09:49:05.840 --> 09:49:07.840
I didn't realise he...

09:49:07.840 --> 09:49:19.840
I think 5 is a prequel because it was so successful that they want to milk it for more pennies, which is fine, because it goes to Keanu Reeves and I'll eat him, so...

09:49:22.840 --> 09:49:30.840
Next movie is called Ballerina with Keanu Reeves, sorry, I can't speak, but he's not the main character.

09:49:30.840 --> 09:49:32.840
Nah, it's from before.

09:49:38.840 --> 09:49:43.840
I'm gonna need some emotional break after that, I was not prepared for that.

09:49:43.840 --> 09:49:48.840
Oh sorry, there's a bird literally hanging out right outside my window, oh my god.

09:49:49.840 --> 09:49:51.840
I was so freaking cocky!

09:49:52.840 --> 09:49:54.840
I was like so cocky.

09:49:55.840 --> 09:49:58.840
Sorry, my voice is going...

09:50:01.840 --> 09:50:03.840
I've got a wee bit of game audio in the background for you.

09:50:13.840 --> 09:50:22.840
I had a feeling you'd have this reaction and none of you has warned me, you'll let me fall into the sensibility of main character can't die because...

09:50:23.840 --> 09:50:33.840
Because there's a fifth movie coming out, no, I'm literally sweating, I'm gonna have to get a shower before I go to bed, I'm sweating that much from my emotional distraught.

09:50:34.840 --> 09:50:36.840
Unbelievable.

09:50:36.840 --> 09:50:43.840
No, spoiler, sorry, no, thank you for not spoiling it, but at the same time, Reflins!

09:50:43.840 --> 09:50:47.840
Why did you not warn me how unbelievably sad John Wick is?

09:50:47.840 --> 09:50:51.840
I don't even remember the first one being so sad.

09:50:52.840 --> 09:50:58.840
Fucking, I'm such a cry baby, I literally just proven I'm like the cry baby out of all of us at VLOG.

09:51:00.840 --> 09:51:03.840
I hadn't seen any of them, I never expected, is it gonna be so emotional?

09:51:03.840 --> 09:51:05.840
Fucking, look at that!

09:51:05.840 --> 09:51:06.840
Pew pew!

09:51:06.840 --> 09:51:08.840
Transformers!

09:51:08.840 --> 09:51:10.840
Like, oh so fun, let's go!

09:51:10.840 --> 09:51:14.840
And then I've got Iron Man next, thank god, I don't have to watch that.

09:51:15.840 --> 09:51:24.840
We're not watching anything further than Iron Man because I cry my eyes out at freaking, how you call it as well, like Marvel series.

09:51:24.840 --> 09:51:27.840
Maybe Avengers assemble, I quite like that.

09:51:27.840 --> 09:51:29.840
Are you squiddin' me right now?

09:51:30.840 --> 09:51:32.840
To be fair, you said no spoilers.

09:51:33.840 --> 09:51:37.840
I know Brian, and Broly Legend, thank you for the tip.

09:51:37.840 --> 09:51:42.840
I know I said no spoilers and thank you for respecting it, but at the same time, oh my god,

09:51:42.840 --> 09:51:51.840
I was watching that being so, pardon me, being so cocky, like mm, mm, yeah, yeah, there's a John Wick 5, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, wrap it up, wrap it up.

09:51:52.840 --> 09:51:58.840
But then it didn't, like as it progressed, it didn't make any sense because he literally got pardoned by the guy.

09:52:01.840 --> 09:52:03.840
And just...

09:52:04.840 --> 09:52:05.840
Ugh.

09:52:08.840 --> 09:52:09.840
Ugh.

09:52:13.840 --> 09:52:18.840
I knew the first one was intensely sad, but I didn't expect that.

09:52:18.840 --> 09:52:22.840
And I always thought John Wick was just a pew-pew, literally a bamboozled.

09:52:22.840 --> 09:52:24.840
Would you have liked it if we had actually spoiled it?

09:52:24.840 --> 09:52:30.840
No, if you spoiled it, it wouldn't have been the same if I knew what was coming up.

09:52:31.840 --> 09:52:38.840
Like, literally as he walked down the flipping church, I was like, ah, he's fine, he's fine.

09:52:38.840 --> 09:52:46.840
And then the scene fades and it says gravestone and I'm like, uh, what?

09:52:47.840 --> 09:52:52.840
What? What? What?

09:52:54.840 --> 09:52:56.840
Like, it doesn't make any sense.

09:52:59.840 --> 09:53:04.840
I thank you, thank you impossible, you couldn't die made it even worse, honestly.

09:53:04.840 --> 09:53:11.840
I was like, wait, he's literally, I don't know what, it must be a Marvel film, I'm thinking of.

09:53:11.840 --> 09:53:17.840
There's one where they're all at a gravestone for someone, but they're not actually dead, they're like hiding behind a tree, watching over.

09:53:17.840 --> 09:53:24.840
Which is exactly what I thought, I was like, oh, he's behind a tree, but then the camera didn't do a big wide shot pan.

09:53:24.840 --> 09:53:29.840
I'm like, uh, hold on a minute, hold on a minute.

09:53:30.840 --> 09:53:36.840
Uh, to be fair, it was the first time I watched the movie, okay, you're not being punished.

09:53:37.840 --> 09:53:55.840
Oh my god, sorry, the next few movie choices, bruv, I'm gonna have to pick familiar movies that are like funny or ha ha, because bruv, bruv, I'm distraught, I am distraught, okay?

09:53:56.840 --> 09:54:06.840
Um, so we did good, yes he also did, Hollywood rules, no dead, no body, no death, the whole blind guy stick didn't make any sense.

09:54:06.840 --> 09:54:22.840
I have to admit, I probably would not, um, I would say the first one was my favourite, and then the second one and then the third and then the fourth is, I would, personally I would not rewatch the fourth.

09:54:22.840 --> 09:54:35.840
No, not just because of the emotional turmoil right at the end for me, but because I didn't really, stuff felt so extended and it felt very gimmicky.

09:54:35.840 --> 09:54:44.840
Um, I wish, perhaps, it was not like so, but it was at the end of the day.

09:54:44.840 --> 09:54:50.840
I wish like the enemy to allies type thing came a lot faster as well.

09:54:50.840 --> 09:55:01.840
I liked the scene when they were at the poker table in particular, and it was like, hold on a minute, we're all against this German guy and it was like, well, keep up that energy, like, keep it going.

09:55:01.840 --> 09:55:12.840
Um, because the guy with the dog doesn't, so he clearly wanted the bounty for John Wick, one big bounty and then he's done,

09:55:12.840 --> 09:55:15.840
but he's very clearly a skilled assassin.

09:55:15.840 --> 09:55:24.840
So, really, what's the dealio about him not just going for like, really simple targets other than, you know, Baba Yaga himself?

09:55:24.840 --> 09:55:34.840
Nah, I know you could say, but the money was so much for him over anything else, but like, I feel like that ally arc could have happened hell of a lot quicker.

09:55:34.840 --> 09:55:48.840
And then Kane at the end, like, just fucking going up those 222 steps, I was like, fucking hurry up, man.

09:55:48.840 --> 09:55:55.840
Like, there was a few scenes where I'm like, hmm, I wasn't exactly digging it.

09:55:55.840 --> 09:55:59.840
Klaus was funny though, I am Klaus.

09:56:00.840 --> 09:56:09.840
Yeah, I don't, I think, I think maybe, I don't know why the fighting scenes don't really seem to do it as much for me.

09:56:09.840 --> 09:56:11.840
I felt like they just went on too long.

09:56:11.840 --> 09:56:24.840
Now, I like when they're like, oh, look how cool he's doing this and that, but I don't know if maybe because I can't appreciate the choreography the way maybe someone else can, um, that it looks very seamy.

09:56:24.840 --> 09:56:37.840
I think the reason why I appreciate the, um, the bird's eye view scene, so much Hotline Miami scene, if you will, was because it looked completely different.

09:56:37.840 --> 09:56:43.840
And it gave you a perspective of like enemies from all sides and he just keeps mowing them down.

09:56:43.840 --> 09:56:52.840
Whereas like the jump cuts and the other battle scene, battle scene, well, I guess they are battles technically, just felt like, okay, okay, we get it, we get it.

09:56:52.840 --> 09:56:54.840
But as Baba Yaga, okay, we get it.

09:56:54.840 --> 09:56:57.840
Wrap it up, wrap it up.

09:56:57.840 --> 09:57:00.840
Keanu Reeves is 59?

09:57:00.840 --> 09:57:05.840
No, he needs to stop doing his own stunts like right now.

09:57:10.840 --> 09:57:13.840
He needs to stop doing stunts right now.

09:57:13.840 --> 09:57:15.840
He is, he is beyond like repair.

09:57:15.840 --> 09:57:19.840
He's probably done some serious damage during those shoots then, if that's true.

09:57:19.840 --> 09:57:21.840
Holy crap, 59.

09:57:22.840 --> 09:57:26.840
They were cool at first, but yeah, after the fourth one is starts to look a bit seamy.

09:57:26.840 --> 09:57:34.840
Yes, I'm sure if like we were choreography people, we would be able to be like, ah, this tactic and this was used and that was used.

09:57:34.840 --> 09:57:46.840
But fortunately, I do not have an eye that can appreciate that type of art, so I can only apologize through my ignorant eye that, um, it did look a bit seamy.

09:57:46.840 --> 09:57:48.840
Well, he's dead, so he doesn't need to do any more stunts.

09:57:48.840 --> 09:57:50.840
Thank you for rubbing that in, Reefling.

09:57:50.840 --> 09:57:52.840
Just for you, here's the timeout.

09:57:52.840 --> 09:57:54.840
Oh, hold on, need to open up.

09:57:54.840 --> 09:57:56.840
Oh, for fuck's sake, I can't.

09:57:56.840 --> 09:57:58.840
Wait, I need to close my...

09:57:58.840 --> 09:58:00.840
Where's the heck is my wee window?

09:58:03.840 --> 09:58:05.840
Hold on a minute.

09:58:05.840 --> 09:58:08.840
Right, put that away because we don't need it.

09:58:08.840 --> 09:58:11.840
Put that away because we don't need it and put that away because we don't need it.

09:58:11.840 --> 09:58:15.840
Okay, and then I open up YouTube.

09:58:15.840 --> 09:58:17.840
No, Mod, did you just take it?

09:58:17.840 --> 09:58:18.840
I'm supposed to do it.

09:58:18.840 --> 09:58:20.840
No, Mod, you ruined it.

09:58:20.840 --> 09:58:21.840
I'm supposed to do it.

09:58:24.840 --> 09:58:26.840
You didn't actually ruin it, Mod, by the way, I'm just teasing.

09:58:26.840 --> 09:58:32.840
Um, what was I saying before I got wildly distracted there?

09:58:32.840 --> 09:58:34.840
Uh, needing to time out anyone?

09:58:34.840 --> 09:58:35.840
Rip that one Reefling.

09:58:35.840 --> 09:58:36.840
Mod, span that, Mod.

09:58:36.840 --> 09:58:38.840
Mod, time out that, Mod.

09:58:38.840 --> 09:58:39.840
What's going on?

09:58:39.840 --> 09:58:42.840
Um, but yes.

09:58:46.840 --> 09:58:48.840
It's a, what?

09:58:48.840 --> 09:58:52.840
Wait a minute, is this a culture clash?

09:58:52.840 --> 09:58:55.840
Someone says what's half-a-living.

09:58:58.840 --> 09:59:01.840
Reeflings, what time is half-a-living?

09:59:03.840 --> 09:59:05.840
Is this a culture clash?

09:59:05.840 --> 09:59:07.840
Do you guys not use this freeze?

09:59:09.840 --> 09:59:11.840
What's half-a-living?

09:59:12.840 --> 09:59:14.840
See one.

09:59:14.840 --> 09:59:16.840
Whoa.

09:59:16.840 --> 09:59:19.840
Okay, hold on.

09:59:19.840 --> 09:59:22.840
You don't say that in America.

09:59:28.840 --> 09:59:30.840
Okay.

09:59:30.840 --> 09:59:33.840
Half-a-living means 1130.

09:59:33.840 --> 09:59:37.840
Like half past 11, half-a-living.

09:59:37.840 --> 09:59:40.840
Half past 10, half-10.

09:59:40.840 --> 09:59:41.840
Who says half-a-living?

09:59:41.840 --> 09:59:42.840
British folk apparently.

09:59:42.840 --> 09:59:46.840
Someone's just commented on my most recent ASMR roleplay.

09:59:46.840 --> 09:59:48.840
They're like, what's half-a-living?

09:59:48.840 --> 09:59:51.840
Uh, wow, I did not know that.

09:59:51.840 --> 09:59:53.840
You learn something new every day.

09:59:53.840 --> 09:59:55.840
Hmm.

10:00:05.840 --> 10:00:07.840
Whee.

10:00:07.840 --> 10:00:09.840
Yes.

10:00:09.840 --> 10:00:14.840
Someone says, I hope Stronea isn't actually a 43 foot giant squid using a voice changer.

10:00:16.840 --> 10:00:18.840
Well.

10:00:19.840 --> 10:00:21.840
Half-a-living, no.

10:00:21.840 --> 10:00:28.840
Half-of-a-living is 5.25 or something.

10:00:28.840 --> 10:00:29.840
Wait, no.

10:00:29.840 --> 10:00:30.840
5.5, yeah.

10:00:30.840 --> 10:00:32.840
Sorry, we don't speak EU.

10:00:32.840 --> 10:00:33.840
Britons are wrong.

10:00:33.840 --> 10:00:34.840
Britons are wrong.

10:00:34.840 --> 10:00:35.840
Steady on.

10:00:35.840 --> 10:00:36.840
Didn't we make the English language?

10:00:36.840 --> 10:00:38.840
And by make, I mean steel parts of the French,

10:00:38.840 --> 10:00:39.840
and then steel parts of the Germanic,

10:00:39.840 --> 10:00:41.840
and then steel parts of the Latin.

10:00:41.840 --> 10:00:43.840
She might be.

10:00:44.840 --> 10:00:46.840
If Stronea's that big, imagine how,

10:00:46.840 --> 10:00:48.840
imagine how much ink we should.

10:00:48.840 --> 10:00:52.840
Oh, wow, we're actually about to get 29,000 on the wings.

10:00:52.840 --> 10:00:54.840
Hmm.

10:01:01.840 --> 10:01:02.840
Hmm.

10:01:02.840 --> 10:01:04.840
5.25.

10:01:04.840 --> 10:01:05.840
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

10:01:05.840 --> 10:01:07.840
I've just had an emotional breakdown.

10:01:07.840 --> 10:01:09.840
Thanks to John Wick 4.

10:01:09.840 --> 10:01:13.840
I need to know, like, right now what the heck happens.

10:01:16.840 --> 10:01:18.840
Still a level 92.

10:01:18.840 --> 10:01:23.840
I, um, should we try and get 93 before I go off?

10:01:23.840 --> 10:01:26.840
Now, I know I said I was going to do an endurance stream.

10:01:26.840 --> 10:01:28.840
I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.

10:01:28.840 --> 10:01:30.840
I am emotionally distraught right now.

10:01:30.840 --> 10:01:33.840
My eyes are bulging out of the skull from how hard I was just crying there.

10:01:33.840 --> 10:01:37.840
I'm not even going to pretend like I'm a crybaby.

10:01:37.840 --> 10:01:40.840
Yeah, but we Britbongs shorten things sometimes.

10:01:40.840 --> 10:01:41.840
I get what you mean.

10:01:41.840 --> 10:01:42.840
Steal this, steal that.

10:01:42.840 --> 10:01:45.840
How about you steal back the tea we dumped a mile?

10:01:45.840 --> 10:01:47.840
Horny horny hor.

10:01:47.840 --> 10:01:48.840
Oh my god.

10:01:48.840 --> 10:01:52.840
Remember that one time the Americans revolted against British taxation

10:01:52.840 --> 10:01:54.840
by putting the D into the harbor and it worked,

10:01:54.840 --> 10:01:57.840
which is actually pretty crazy because normally,

10:01:57.840 --> 10:02:01.840
actually, I tell a lie, you don't normally get taught

10:02:01.840 --> 10:02:03.840
when revolution works.

10:02:03.840 --> 10:02:06.840
It's, um, purposely not taught that often.

10:02:07.840 --> 10:02:10.840
Unless it's done via memes, which is why everyone finds,

10:02:10.840 --> 10:02:12.840
ha ha, dumping tea in the harbor funny,

10:02:12.840 --> 10:02:15.840
but it's actually a form of revolution

10:02:15.840 --> 10:02:20.840
and you're not really, you don't get many examples of it working.

10:02:20.840 --> 10:02:25.840
Now you don't name another example of a revolution working.

10:02:25.840 --> 10:02:28.840
It's okay, you can rest and we'll continue tomorrow.

10:02:28.840 --> 10:02:30.840
What a waste of good tea.

10:02:30.840 --> 10:02:33.840
Our little cuddly seaweed.

10:02:33.840 --> 10:02:35.840
Tenors is an endurance stream.

10:02:36.840 --> 10:02:40.840
And hospital and hospital.

10:02:40.840 --> 10:02:43.840
Yeah, you get, yeah, you skip the duck

10:02:43.840 --> 10:02:47.840
because, you know, you're still at the hospital either way.

10:02:47.840 --> 10:02:49.840
Our little cry baby.

10:02:49.840 --> 10:02:50.840
Yeah, you can do that.

10:02:50.840 --> 10:02:52.840
You can make me cry again.

10:02:52.840 --> 10:02:55.840
What if I cried and then you put me on your lap

10:02:55.840 --> 10:02:57.840
and then like pet my hair and stuff

10:02:57.840 --> 10:03:00.840
and rocked me back and forth,

10:03:00.840 --> 10:03:03.840
reinsuring me that John Wick was a good man.

10:03:03.840 --> 10:03:08.840
Um, I mean, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

10:03:08.840 --> 10:03:12.840
Damn, no chance of getting you to watch my queer

10:03:12.840 --> 10:03:14.840
when the promise flower blooms

10:03:14.840 --> 10:03:17.840
then that movie will make you call your mom crying your butt.

10:03:17.840 --> 10:03:22.840
Stop, no, I'm not touching any film that has any...

10:03:22.840 --> 10:03:24.840
Someone said how to train your dragon

10:03:24.840 --> 10:03:26.840
and I'm pretty sure I got a warrant.

10:03:26.840 --> 10:03:29.840
Someone else commented as a warning being like,

10:03:29.840 --> 10:03:30.840
do not put that on.

10:03:30.840 --> 10:03:32.840
And I'm like, ew, okay.

10:03:32.840 --> 10:03:35.840
I thought it was just a cute show about a dragon.

10:03:35.840 --> 10:03:39.840
A cute movie because the first movie I did watch

10:03:39.840 --> 10:03:43.840
where he gets the dragon

10:03:43.840 --> 10:03:46.840
and they become friends and they can both fly

10:03:46.840 --> 10:03:48.840
but they need each other and stuff.

10:03:48.840 --> 10:03:53.840
Um, but yeah.

10:03:53.840 --> 10:03:56.840
You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.

10:03:56.840 --> 10:03:58.840
Mmm, I've seen that a lot.

10:03:58.840 --> 10:04:00.840
I don't know what it's from, but...

10:04:00.840 --> 10:04:01.840
But no, sorry.

10:04:01.840 --> 10:04:03.840
I know it's from how to train your dragon

10:04:03.840 --> 10:04:05.840
but I don't, like, I've not seen that.

10:04:05.840 --> 10:04:07.840
Mmm, maybe it's in the second one.

10:04:07.840 --> 10:04:11.840
I think there's three how to train your dragon.

10:04:11.840 --> 10:04:14.840
How come how to train your dragon is nice?

10:04:14.840 --> 10:04:16.840
I don't know, someone warned me saying

10:04:16.840 --> 10:04:18.840
that there's something emotionally distraught in it

10:04:18.840 --> 10:04:20.840
and I'd probably be an absolute blubber and mess.

10:04:20.840 --> 10:04:22.840
I need to recover and do some, like, funny ha ha,

10:04:22.840 --> 10:04:27.840
like, um, the Monty Python type stuff.

10:04:27.840 --> 10:04:30.840
Funny ha ha, Iron Man again, it's got good music in it

10:04:30.840 --> 10:04:33.840
and we can look at the cool weapons and stuff.

10:04:33.840 --> 10:04:37.840
Like, I need to recover from what I've experienced today.

10:04:37.840 --> 10:04:39.840
Cocky just...

10:04:39.840 --> 10:04:41.840
Oh, there's a John Wick 5.

10:04:41.840 --> 10:04:44.840
Obviously he can't perish and he perishes.

10:04:44.840 --> 10:04:47.840
Ugh, now watch the second one.

10:04:47.840 --> 10:04:49.840
The second movie, is it okay?

10:04:49.840 --> 10:04:51.840
Gotta cry every time I have to train your dragon too.

10:04:51.840 --> 10:04:53.840
Okay, so that's what's making me...

10:04:53.840 --> 10:04:54.840
I'm getting nervous.

10:04:54.840 --> 10:04:55.840
I'm getting nervous.

10:04:55.840 --> 10:04:56.840
I'm getting shaky about that movie.

10:04:56.840 --> 10:04:58.840
We'll come back, I wouldn't mind watching it

10:04:58.840 --> 10:05:01.840
because it was, like, the only book I read as a child.

10:05:01.840 --> 10:05:03.840
Um, oops.

10:05:03.840 --> 10:05:05.840
Um...

10:05:05.840 --> 10:05:07.840
But I need time, I need time to progress

10:05:07.840 --> 10:05:08.840
what I've just went through.

10:05:08.840 --> 10:05:10.840
Okay, I don't feel well.

10:05:10.840 --> 10:05:12.840
I don't feel well.

10:05:12.840 --> 10:05:14.840
I want to wrap myself up in a burrito.

10:05:14.840 --> 10:05:16.840
I want to nuke myself on TikTok.

10:05:16.840 --> 10:05:17.840
I would actually like to see more movies

10:05:17.840 --> 10:05:19.840
slash shows that would make you cry

10:05:19.840 --> 10:05:23.840
so that us leaflings can take care of you afterwards.

10:05:23.840 --> 10:05:25.840
Okay, that's different.

10:05:25.840 --> 10:05:26.840
That's different, then.

10:05:26.840 --> 10:05:27.840
I'll allow it.

10:05:27.840 --> 10:05:28.840
Um...

10:05:28.840 --> 10:05:29.840
Oh, I forgot.

10:05:29.840 --> 10:05:31.840
I'm ventriloquism right now.

10:05:31.840 --> 10:05:32.840
I completely forgot that.

10:05:32.840 --> 10:05:34.840
Is this still broken?

10:05:34.840 --> 10:05:37.840
Hold on, let me close.

10:05:37.840 --> 10:05:40.840
I don't know why it's lagging behind,

10:05:40.840 --> 10:05:42.840
but I'll just ventriloquist.

10:05:42.840 --> 10:05:44.840
Thank you for the tip, Anon.

10:05:44.840 --> 10:05:45.840
Anonymous, sorry.

10:05:45.840 --> 10:05:47.840
I need to see your full name.

10:05:47.840 --> 10:05:49.840
Anonymous, that's right.

10:05:49.840 --> 10:05:51.840
You want me to cry more?

10:05:51.840 --> 10:05:52.840
I mean, shit, let's just build up

10:05:52.840 --> 10:05:54.840
how to train your dragon tomorrow, fuck it.

10:05:55.840 --> 10:05:56.840
You want tears?

10:05:56.840 --> 10:05:58.840
I'll show you tears.

10:06:06.840 --> 10:06:08.840
Usually when I'm sad or go through

10:06:08.840 --> 10:06:10.840
is when I watch shows that are sad

10:06:10.840 --> 10:06:12.840
and jokes I knew I was already sad.

10:06:12.840 --> 10:06:14.840
No, I would never do that.

10:06:14.840 --> 10:06:17.840
When I'm sad, I try my best to like...

10:06:17.840 --> 10:06:19.840
Well, work, I guess.

10:06:19.840 --> 10:06:21.840
I just work through everything, to be honest.

10:06:21.840 --> 10:06:23.840
Hold on a minute.

10:06:23.840 --> 10:06:26.840
My own secret, I've cracked my own secret.

10:06:26.840 --> 10:06:30.840
Yes, I just work through sadness.

10:06:30.840 --> 10:06:32.840
I don't know, this sounds a bit silly,

10:06:32.840 --> 10:06:35.840
but I don't really have time to be emotionally upset.

10:06:35.840 --> 10:06:38.840
I have half work to do, sorry.

10:06:38.840 --> 10:06:43.840
Earlier when I was editing the Patreon audio,

10:06:43.840 --> 10:06:46.840
I say it earlier, it was probably 24 hours ago,

10:06:46.840 --> 10:06:49.840
I guess I was doing it, maybe, I don't know.

10:06:49.840 --> 10:06:51.840
Or 12 hours?

10:06:51.840 --> 10:06:53.840
You know what I mean.

10:06:53.840 --> 10:06:56.840
When I was editing it, I was like...

10:06:56.840 --> 10:06:59.840
I was getting really tired of editing,

10:06:59.840 --> 10:07:02.840
I feel frustrated because I have all these plans

10:07:02.840 --> 10:07:06.840
and three more VTubers have agreed to do ASMR with me

10:07:06.840 --> 10:07:09.840
and I feel like I'm letting them down type thing.

10:07:09.840 --> 10:07:11.840
And I was getting frustrated and I was like,

10:07:11.840 --> 10:07:14.840
I just want to lie down and rot, basically.

10:07:14.840 --> 10:07:19.840
But then I was like, no, the reeflings need their inking session.

10:07:22.840 --> 10:07:26.840
Yeah, but it's funny you always work too much, I don't know.

10:07:26.840 --> 10:07:29.840
But I felt frustrated, but then I was like,

10:07:29.840 --> 10:07:31.840
I don't have time to be frustrated,

10:07:31.840 --> 10:07:33.840
I need to just keep going.

10:07:33.840 --> 10:07:37.840
Who's that guy that's condemned to push that rock up the hill

10:07:37.840 --> 10:07:39.840
and it always falls down at the end?

10:07:39.840 --> 10:07:41.840
A bit dramatic of a comparison,

10:07:41.840 --> 10:07:45.840
but I'm very late.

10:07:45.840 --> 10:07:48.840
We have finished all four movies, there's no more movies.

10:07:48.840 --> 10:07:51.840
It's just me explaining how distraught I am.

10:07:51.840 --> 10:07:54.840
Please do not watch the John Wick series

10:07:54.840 --> 10:07:59.840
if you find yourself to be a crybaby like myself, okay?

10:07:59.840 --> 10:08:02.840
If you right-click the XP circle near the mini-map

10:08:02.840 --> 10:08:05.840
and do set up, what does that mean?

10:08:05.840 --> 10:08:08.840
XP, show XP drops.

10:08:08.840 --> 10:08:11.840
This? You want this?

10:08:11.840 --> 10:08:15.840
Okay, I put it on.

10:08:16.840 --> 10:08:18.840
I think we'll get to level 93.

10:08:18.840 --> 10:08:20.840
Wait, why did you go away?

10:08:20.840 --> 10:08:21.840
Is that the right thing?

10:08:21.840 --> 10:08:23.840
If you right-click, right-click.

10:08:23.840 --> 10:08:25.840
Set up.

10:08:25.840 --> 10:08:27.840
Whoa, what does it mean?

10:08:27.840 --> 10:08:29.840
Do cooking, please.

10:08:37.840 --> 10:08:40.840
Yeah, that looks right.

10:08:41.840 --> 10:08:44.840
And then this blue, what the fuck?

10:08:44.840 --> 10:08:46.840
Sorry, hold on.

10:08:46.840 --> 10:08:48.840
Hold on, I'm being Papaga.

10:08:48.840 --> 10:08:49.840
Wait, did I just level up?

10:08:49.840 --> 10:08:50.840
No, it didn't.

10:08:50.840 --> 10:08:52.840
What?

10:08:53.840 --> 10:08:54.840
What?

10:08:54.840 --> 10:08:56.840
Wait, people can see it.

10:08:56.840 --> 10:08:58.840
Hold on.

10:08:58.840 --> 10:09:00.840
Why does that not keep displaying?

10:09:00.840 --> 10:09:01.840
Right-medium default.

10:09:01.840 --> 10:09:03.840
Duration, perma.

10:09:03.840 --> 10:09:04.840
Okay.

10:09:04.840 --> 10:09:05.840
And what?

10:09:05.840 --> 10:09:06.840
It stays up?

10:09:06.840 --> 10:09:08.840
You stay up?

10:09:08.840 --> 10:09:10.840
You stay up?

10:09:10.840 --> 10:09:13.840
Okay, I think it stays up now.

10:09:14.840 --> 10:09:16.840
Eh.

10:09:17.840 --> 10:09:21.840
The reeflings need their incincision to take me out through for all.

10:09:21.840 --> 10:09:23.840
Look, I get motivated in many ways.

10:09:23.840 --> 10:09:26.840
Some ways are...

10:09:28.840 --> 10:09:32.840
What the heck happened to my inventory to achieve that?

10:09:32.840 --> 10:09:34.840
Hope you aren't getting too stressed.

10:09:34.840 --> 10:09:36.840
No, things are like definitely coming down.

10:09:36.840 --> 10:09:40.840
It's because I'm doing that thing where I give myself too much work at once.

10:09:40.840 --> 10:09:42.840
That's what stressed me out.

10:09:43.840 --> 10:09:49.840
I need to edit my Patreon audios for July.

10:09:49.840 --> 10:09:51.840
I've not done that.

10:09:51.840 --> 10:09:54.840
Because I've been focused on getting the girls set up with shorts now.

10:09:54.840 --> 10:10:00.840
That's the next thing is trying to do shorts and getting them up-tick in subscribers.

10:10:00.840 --> 10:10:04.840
Because I would love to get them play buttons at the end of the day.

10:10:04.840 --> 10:10:06.840
I'm going to try my best.

10:10:06.840 --> 10:10:08.840
I'm going to try my best.

10:10:08.840 --> 10:10:10.840
I'm going to tell them everything that I'm doing.

10:10:10.840 --> 10:10:13.840
And I hope for the best.

10:10:13.840 --> 10:10:16.840
But it would be lovely to get them a play button.

10:10:18.840 --> 10:10:20.840
Should we clip watch-alongs?

10:10:20.840 --> 10:10:25.840
What, the part with me when I'm just crying uncontrollably?

10:10:26.840 --> 10:10:27.840
Syphilis?

10:10:27.840 --> 10:10:28.840
What?

10:10:28.840 --> 10:10:30.840
Oh, Sisyphus.

10:10:30.840 --> 10:10:31.840
Sorry.

10:10:31.840 --> 10:10:35.840
I completely missed when you guys said the Rolling Stones guy name.

10:10:35.840 --> 10:10:38.840
Where he shoves a stone up the hill.

10:10:38.840 --> 10:10:42.840
I literally thought you were all seeing Syphilis and Unison at once.

10:10:42.840 --> 10:10:46.840
And I'm like, what on earth did I see to get you guys to see that at the same time?

10:10:46.840 --> 10:10:48.840
That was...

10:10:48.840 --> 10:10:50.840
That was confused there.

10:10:51.840 --> 10:10:54.840
There's GD clinics down at the left, love, honestly.

10:10:54.840 --> 10:10:55.840
Honestly.

10:10:56.840 --> 10:10:58.840
Wait, let me...

10:10:58.840 --> 10:11:00.840
What do you call it, a sheebie like that?

10:11:00.840 --> 10:11:03.840
It was a sheebie's internet that was dial-up.

10:11:04.840 --> 10:11:06.840
It was Azura's internet.

10:11:06.840 --> 10:11:10.840
I'm gonna try and get her moved out so I can buy her better internet.

10:11:12.840 --> 10:11:13.840
Sort of PC.

10:11:13.840 --> 10:11:14.840
Yeah, or PC.

10:11:14.840 --> 10:11:15.840
Internet can keep up.

10:11:15.840 --> 10:11:17.840
I clipped the part after the movie.

10:11:17.840 --> 10:11:19.840
She said a really cool line.

10:11:21.840 --> 10:11:23.840
Yeah, the leader sang into the Rolling Stones.

10:11:24.840 --> 10:11:26.840
Mom, is it like 5 a.m.?

10:11:26.840 --> 10:11:28.840
It is 2 p.m.

10:11:28.840 --> 10:11:30.840
For me.

10:11:31.840 --> 10:11:34.840
Because I run a business in Australia.

10:11:34.840 --> 10:11:36.840
That's not even a joke.

10:11:36.840 --> 10:11:38.840
There's no booms at the end of that.

10:11:38.840 --> 10:11:41.840
It's like, it's a bridge, honestly.

10:11:43.840 --> 10:11:44.840
But yes.

10:11:45.840 --> 10:11:47.840
Remaining XP.

10:11:47.840 --> 10:11:48.840
64.

10:11:48.840 --> 10:11:50.840
Wait, why isn't it showing a big bar like that?

10:11:50.840 --> 10:11:52.840
I've done that bar wrong.

10:11:52.840 --> 10:11:53.840
Hmm.

10:11:54.840 --> 10:11:55.840
Hold on.

10:11:55.840 --> 10:11:57.840
I've done this wrong.

10:11:57.840 --> 10:11:59.840
Set up.

10:12:00.840 --> 10:12:01.840
What?

10:12:04.840 --> 10:12:07.840
Just disable the current character.

10:12:14.840 --> 10:12:15.840
Like...

10:12:17.840 --> 10:12:18.840
Whoa!

10:12:18.840 --> 10:12:19.840
I am smart.

10:12:19.840 --> 10:12:20.840
I am so smart.

10:12:20.840 --> 10:12:21.840
SMRT.

10:12:23.840 --> 10:12:25.840
Is that what I was supposed to do?

10:12:25.840 --> 10:12:27.840
Set the top line?

10:12:27.840 --> 10:12:29.840
Set the top line?

10:12:29.840 --> 10:12:30.840
Oh.

10:12:30.840 --> 10:12:31.840
I mean, does this not work?

10:12:31.840 --> 10:12:33.840
Technically this works?

10:12:33.840 --> 10:12:35.840
And you can see I'm like right about to get it.

10:12:37.840 --> 10:12:39.840
7 hours of driving.

10:12:39.840 --> 10:12:40.840
Holy shit.

10:12:40.840 --> 10:12:43.840
I would be bored out of my mind, I think.

10:12:43.840 --> 10:12:45.840
I'd be a menace on the road.

10:12:45.840 --> 10:12:46.840
That works.

10:12:46.840 --> 10:12:47.840
Yeah, close enough.

10:12:47.840 --> 10:12:48.840
We got there in the end.

10:12:48.840 --> 10:12:49.840
That's the main thing.

10:12:49.840 --> 10:12:51.840
It's just showing you the next level.

10:12:51.840 --> 10:12:55.840
Yeah, we are gonna finish 47.

10:12:55.840 --> 10:12:58.840
I don't think there's any other...

10:12:58.840 --> 10:12:59.840
Brian!

10:13:08.840 --> 10:13:09.840
Oh no, I'm okay.

10:13:09.840 --> 10:13:10.840
I just...

10:13:10.840 --> 10:13:14.840
Why the frick is this not going out of my inventory?

10:13:14.840 --> 10:13:16.840
No, don't worry.

10:13:16.840 --> 10:13:17.840
I'm honestly fine.

10:13:17.840 --> 10:13:19.840
Thank you for the tip again.

10:13:19.840 --> 10:13:20.840
Thank you for the 5.

10:13:20.840 --> 10:13:21.840
Broly legend.

10:13:21.840 --> 10:13:22.840
I promise I'm okay.

10:13:22.840 --> 10:13:23.840
I'm just a cry baby.

10:13:23.840 --> 10:13:25.840
That's the problem.

10:13:28.840 --> 10:13:29.840
Yes.

10:13:29.840 --> 10:13:30.840
I should think about lunch.

10:13:30.840 --> 10:13:32.840
I have work in one hour.

10:13:32.840 --> 10:13:33.840
Monk guys.

10:13:33.840 --> 10:13:34.840
Monk guys.

10:13:34.840 --> 10:13:37.840
I don't think there's any Villarra girl on right now.

10:13:40.840 --> 10:13:42.840
So we'll be redirecting into someone.

10:13:42.840 --> 10:13:44.840
I don't know who yet.

10:13:45.840 --> 10:13:48.840
I was gonna bring my iron here and get 9-9 Kirk and Mesa.

10:13:48.840 --> 10:13:49.840
Oops.

10:13:49.840 --> 10:13:51.840
What does that mean?

10:13:51.840 --> 10:13:54.840
Right, let's see if I can find someone to redirect into them.

10:13:54.840 --> 10:13:56.840
Maybe there's a Yumi plus girl up.

10:13:56.840 --> 10:13:59.840
They kinda do it a bit later than us.

10:14:03.840 --> 10:14:05.840
Oh, they're playing Apex together.

10:14:05.840 --> 10:14:06.840
That's...

10:14:06.840 --> 10:14:07.840
Oh no, Azura's on League!

10:14:07.840 --> 10:14:08.840
Oh, hold on, hold on.

10:14:08.840 --> 10:14:13.840
Can someone bomb Azura's chat and ask her if she's going a bit further?

10:14:15.840 --> 10:14:16.840
Can someone...

10:14:16.840 --> 10:14:21.840
Any bleeding hearts want to ask if Azura is staying up a bit longer?

10:14:22.840 --> 10:14:24.840
Get yourself some good takeout.

10:14:25.840 --> 10:14:27.840
I actually need to boil my eggs.

10:14:27.840 --> 10:14:31.840
I've bought eggs and then I've wasted 2.

10:14:35.840 --> 10:14:38.840
Azura is addicted to League, sadly, yes.

10:14:38.840 --> 10:14:40.840
It's ogre for her truly.

10:14:47.840 --> 10:14:51.840
I've been stuck with lots of work and it doesn't help that outside of that

10:14:51.840 --> 10:14:54.840
I've been feeling espresso-depresso.

10:14:54.840 --> 10:14:55.840
I get you and I hope things...

10:14:55.840 --> 10:14:57.840
Oh no, things get easier for me.

10:14:57.840 --> 10:14:59.840
I like reset after I sleep.

10:14:59.840 --> 10:15:02.840
Like, if I ever have the worst day of my life, I just need to sleep

10:15:02.840 --> 10:15:04.840
and then I'll wake up and I'm like, oh, okay.

10:15:04.840 --> 10:15:06.840
Okay, let's go again.

10:15:06.840 --> 10:15:08.840
I'm like, okay, let me get it.

10:15:08.840 --> 10:15:10.840
Let's see what edits I can do.

10:15:10.840 --> 10:15:12.840
She's deep in the League minds.

10:15:12.840 --> 10:15:13.840
Is she?

10:15:13.840 --> 10:15:14.840
Direct into her then?

10:15:14.840 --> 10:15:15.840
Right, hold on, let me...

10:15:15.840 --> 10:15:17.840
Save changes.

10:15:19.840 --> 10:15:20.840
Okay.

10:15:22.840 --> 10:15:23.840
Right, we're almost there, oh my god.

10:15:23.840 --> 10:15:29.840
And we're in 50, 29,000 wains.

10:15:29.840 --> 10:15:30.840
So we're getting there.

10:15:30.840 --> 10:15:32.840
So how many did we do today?

10:15:32.840 --> 10:15:34.840
Like, over 10,000?

10:15:34.840 --> 10:15:37.840
So what, that's two more endurance streams?

10:15:37.840 --> 10:15:42.840
I just want to warn you, the odds of tomorrow's stream being changed are quite high.

10:15:42.840 --> 10:15:43.840
Okay.

10:15:43.840 --> 10:15:45.840
Do I think I'll be able to re...

10:15:45.840 --> 10:15:46.840
Oh, easily.

10:15:46.840 --> 10:15:48.840
We just need another...

10:15:48.840 --> 10:15:52.840
Tomorrow I was going to watch my gen mate's content,

10:15:52.840 --> 10:15:57.840
but I think I might be too emotionally upset for a longer stream.

10:15:57.840 --> 10:15:58.840
Me.

10:15:58.840 --> 10:16:00.840
Oh, I reset after I sleep.

10:16:00.840 --> 10:16:02.840
Also me, I'm so emotionally upset over John Wick.

10:16:02.840 --> 10:16:05.840
I cannot, like, have an endurance stream tomorrow.

10:16:05.840 --> 10:16:07.840
I need to give myself a break.

10:16:08.840 --> 10:16:12.840
Because I'm actually withering away.

10:16:12.840 --> 10:16:14.840
What does it say?

10:16:14.840 --> 10:16:19.840
You can make around 2.4k wains an hour if you're curious how long it'll be.

10:16:19.840 --> 10:16:23.840
So if I've got 29, divide by 2...

10:16:25.840 --> 10:16:28.840
Okay, let's do 20, divide by 2 instead.

10:16:28.840 --> 10:16:34.840
Another 14 hours, so technically 2 endurance streams and then I'm good to go.

10:16:34.840 --> 10:16:35.840
We did it.

10:16:38.840 --> 10:16:40.840
So, Veltro then.

10:16:40.840 --> 10:16:42.840
Possibly.

10:16:42.840 --> 10:16:46.840
I do, I'm really, I'm thoroughly enjoying Veltro.

10:16:46.840 --> 10:16:49.840
I want to see if I can get a win on every deck.

10:16:49.840 --> 10:16:51.840
Whether or not we'll get it or not,

10:16:51.840 --> 10:16:55.840
but our little trouser pants thing is just so OP.

10:16:55.840 --> 10:17:00.840
And we're unlocking new cards as well for interesting, like, combinations and stuff coming up.

10:17:00.840 --> 10:17:01.840
Combination.

10:17:01.840 --> 10:17:04.840
So 11 hours if you're perfect.

10:17:05.840 --> 10:17:08.840
No, I've got 29,000 wains.

10:17:10.840 --> 10:17:13.840
What, 2.4k? Oh no, there's no way.

10:17:13.840 --> 10:17:16.840
Didn't manage to drop my fire-making cake.

10:17:16.840 --> 10:17:18.840
Cake, not cake, sorry.

10:17:18.840 --> 10:17:21.840
Don't drop the cake, don't drop the cake, baby.

10:17:21.840 --> 10:17:25.840
If you wanna feel free to play it, I think everyone will love it anyway.

10:17:25.840 --> 10:17:30.840
Yeah, I think maybe the odds of me doing endurance runescape tomorrow are...

10:17:31.840 --> 10:17:33.840
Not quite there, not quite there.

10:17:33.840 --> 10:17:36.840
Well, not feeling like it, to be honest, not feeling like it.

10:17:36.840 --> 10:17:38.840
Where are you, 9 million xp?

10:17:38.840 --> 10:17:40.840
Well, I'm 7 million xp, get wrecked.

10:17:42.840 --> 10:17:43.840
Wah.

10:17:43.840 --> 10:17:47.840
I'm surprised there's not a faster way of doing cooking.

10:17:47.840 --> 10:17:50.840
Is there really no faster way than wine?

10:17:50.840 --> 10:17:53.840
Or is the burn rate too high on items?

10:17:53.840 --> 10:17:54.840
Must be.

10:17:55.840 --> 10:17:56.840
Mmm.

10:17:56.840 --> 10:17:57.840
Mmm.

10:17:57.840 --> 10:17:59.840
Shock and behavior.

10:17:59.840 --> 10:18:04.840
I like hearing you play Belcher on the background, it helps me finish a bit.

10:18:04.840 --> 10:18:06.840
What? It helps me finish it.

10:18:06.840 --> 10:18:10.840
No, it helped me finish that bit for you yesterday.

10:18:10.840 --> 10:18:12.840
What?

10:18:12.840 --> 10:18:19.840
I like hearing you play Belcher on the background, it helped me finish that bit for you yesterday.

10:18:19.840 --> 10:18:21.840
A meme? A meme?

10:18:24.840 --> 10:18:25.840
The...

10:18:25.840 --> 10:18:29.840
Oh, I commissioned myself pregnant, did I say that yet?

10:18:32.840 --> 10:18:34.840
There's a faster way, but it's very quick and...

10:18:34.840 --> 10:18:35.840
Oh, okay, okay.

10:18:38.840 --> 10:18:40.840
Hearing her in the background will do them work.

10:18:40.840 --> 10:18:42.840
Makes it less insufferable?

10:18:42.840 --> 10:18:44.840
Yeah, you like that little Scotch accent?

10:18:44.840 --> 10:18:48.840
Mmm, yes, you love this voice in your ears while you work away.

10:18:48.840 --> 10:18:50.840
Mmm, that's right.

10:18:50.840 --> 10:18:55.840
Do the most menial tasks while your boss makes a dollar and you make a dime

10:18:55.840 --> 10:18:58.840
and that's why you take a fat shite on company time.

10:18:58.840 --> 10:19:00.840
Oh, man.

10:19:00.840 --> 10:19:01.840
No, the art bit.

10:19:01.840 --> 10:19:03.840
Congrats on finding the game pregnant.

10:19:03.840 --> 10:19:05.840
Thank you, it was really hard.

10:19:05.840 --> 10:19:08.840
You know, the lights were off, there was a lot of reef lens,

10:19:08.840 --> 10:19:11.840
there was a lot of slippery wet tentacles.

10:19:11.840 --> 10:19:15.840
I'm going left and right, but hey, I commissioned it.

10:19:15.840 --> 10:19:20.840
It's two weeks to get here, we'll write the script together, how outrageous.

10:19:20.840 --> 10:19:25.840
The artist was actually a bit worried about me getting in trouble with YouTube for it,

10:19:25.840 --> 10:19:29.840
but I'm like, I'm pretty sure YouTube doesn't ban pregnant people.

10:19:29.840 --> 10:19:33.840
It's just me being like, oh, I can't wait to meet you little reef lens.

10:19:33.840 --> 10:19:39.840
I'm going to be like, I've named you and you're going to be my baby boy

10:19:39.840 --> 10:19:43.840
and I'm going to say all the exciting things that I...

10:19:43.840 --> 10:19:46.840
I'm going to talk to you about your grandparents.

10:19:46.840 --> 10:19:50.840
Me, Mon, Paul, I'm going to tell you that they're gamers

10:19:50.840 --> 10:19:53.840
and I'm a gamer and I hope you might be a gamer too

10:19:53.840 --> 10:19:57.840
and I'll show you all the fun things and I'll never be cruel about your hobbies.

10:19:57.840 --> 10:20:00.840
I can't wait for you to share your hobbies with me.

10:20:00.840 --> 10:20:03.840
It's now illegal to be pregnant on YouTube.

10:20:03.840 --> 10:20:05.840
It was really hard.

10:20:05.840 --> 10:20:06.840
What was us?

10:20:06.840 --> 10:20:07.840
Exactly.

10:20:07.840 --> 10:20:10.840
The baby and the father, both me for overall.

10:20:10.840 --> 10:20:12.840
Getting pregnant, sure, but how could you be pregnant?

10:20:12.840 --> 10:20:16.840
I think just because of how ridiculous YouTube is being right now,

10:20:16.840 --> 10:20:20.840
they need to come out and say that your licking isn't allowed anymore

10:20:20.840 --> 10:20:23.840
or they need to take a step back and be like,

10:20:23.840 --> 10:20:26.840
look, women can breathe again in a three-deal

10:20:26.840 --> 10:20:29.840
because it's getting a bit ridiculous.

10:20:29.840 --> 10:20:31.840
You think you'll get away with that?

10:20:31.840 --> 10:20:35.840
Well, I had a really good short made about ear licking

10:20:35.840 --> 10:20:37.840
and I think it would...

10:20:37.840 --> 10:20:39.840
Oh man, this is going to do numbers.

10:20:39.840 --> 10:20:41.840
I thought it was going to do really well

10:20:41.840 --> 10:20:42.840
but I'm too scared to upload it

10:20:42.840 --> 10:20:44.840
because I've currently got a warning on the channel

10:20:44.840 --> 10:20:47.840
and I'm like, hmm.

10:20:47.840 --> 10:20:49.840
And I want to re-upload the clapping one

10:20:49.840 --> 10:20:51.840
but like cut out the breathing section

10:20:51.840 --> 10:20:53.840
where I breathed in the ear basically

10:20:53.840 --> 10:20:57.840
because everything before the ten-minute mark was fine

10:20:57.840 --> 10:21:00.840
but after the ten-minute mark, which was the inner ear breathing,

10:21:00.840 --> 10:21:01.840
that's when they pulled it off.

10:21:01.840 --> 10:21:03.840
They're like, that's what violated the terms of service

10:21:03.840 --> 10:21:06.840
and I'm like, okay then.

10:21:07.840 --> 10:21:12.840
So I might just cut off the end and re-upload it

10:21:12.840 --> 10:21:18.840
and at a later date, like once the 90-day punishment is up.

10:21:18.840 --> 10:21:20.840
So there's like another 80 days on the punishment.

10:21:20.840 --> 10:21:22.840
They are not kidding around.

10:21:22.840 --> 10:21:25.840
Three months punishment for like...

10:21:25.840 --> 10:21:28.840
I mean, I get that they can't moderate everything all at once

10:21:28.840 --> 10:21:33.840
because they're like, how insanely busy the website is both.

10:21:33.840 --> 10:21:34.840
I was kind of worried about the same thing

10:21:34.840 --> 10:21:36.840
before I posted the fan art to Twitter.

10:21:36.840 --> 10:21:37.840
Hey, what are you trying to do?

10:21:37.840 --> 10:21:38.840
You want to meet me cry again?

10:21:38.840 --> 10:21:39.840
Yum.

10:21:41.840 --> 10:21:42.840
Stop breathing, woman.

10:21:42.840 --> 10:21:44.840
You're taking up all the MasterCard.

10:21:44.840 --> 10:21:46.840
My favorite thing is like, I consent.

10:21:46.840 --> 10:21:48.840
I consent and then it's a picture of MasterCard

10:21:48.840 --> 10:21:53.840
and it's like, but do I consent or something like that?

10:21:53.840 --> 10:21:55.840
If it works, use it as a 3K video.

10:21:55.840 --> 10:21:56.840
Oh no.

10:21:56.840 --> 10:22:01.840
So the next video upload is going to be a collab

10:22:01.840 --> 10:22:03.840
and then it's going to be the 3K

10:22:03.840 --> 10:22:06.840
and then it's going to be a collab and then it's the 4K.

10:22:06.840 --> 10:22:08.840
I'm doing it like that because I've got a few people

10:22:08.840 --> 10:22:11.840
waiting on content.

10:22:11.840 --> 10:22:13.840
They've been waiting patiently for me.

10:22:13.840 --> 10:22:15.840
And I'm taking my sweet time.

10:22:15.840 --> 10:22:17.840
Is there someone you forgot to ask?

10:22:17.840 --> 10:22:19.840
Yes, that's it.

10:22:19.840 --> 10:22:24.840
The next 3K audio I think might be...

10:22:24.840 --> 10:22:26.840
I don't know.

10:22:27.840 --> 10:22:31.840
I've edited a burping audio, which is disgusting,

10:22:31.840 --> 10:22:33.840
but I'm scared to upload it because I'm like,

10:22:33.840 --> 10:22:35.840
well, I had the audacity to burp in the ear

10:22:35.840 --> 10:22:37.840
as YouTube is going to be like,

10:22:37.840 --> 10:22:38.840
ah, that's breathing in the mic.

10:22:38.840 --> 10:22:41.840
Here's a strike and you can't stream for a week.

10:22:41.840 --> 10:22:45.840
The rules are getting so arbitrary.

10:22:45.840 --> 10:22:46.840
Arbiter.

10:22:46.840 --> 10:22:48.840
As I said, we're playing Halo right now.

10:22:48.840 --> 10:22:49.840
Arbiter.

10:22:51.840 --> 10:22:53.840
I only wanted to ease your job.

10:22:53.840 --> 10:22:55.840
I guess you like it though.

10:22:55.840 --> 10:22:56.840
What is it?

10:22:56.840 --> 10:22:58.840
It's an easy job.

10:22:58.840 --> 10:23:00.840
What is this?

10:23:02.840 --> 10:23:06.840
Stony is going to filter her audience before we do it.

10:23:06.840 --> 10:23:08.840
I already did it.

10:23:08.840 --> 10:23:10.840
I think I've told you guys this plan before,

10:23:10.840 --> 10:23:13.840
but because I'll upload ASMR role-play videos,

10:23:13.840 --> 10:23:18.840
no one is going to watch the live stream unless it's ASMR.

10:23:18.840 --> 10:23:20.840
Because I only do ASMR once a week.

10:23:20.840 --> 10:23:24.840
We're naturally more of a tight-knit community,

10:23:24.840 --> 10:23:28.840
which I prefer because I feel like I can see what I want to do.

10:23:29.840 --> 10:23:33.840
Whereas if I had a lot of eyes on me and I'm like,

10:23:33.840 --> 10:23:35.840
I'm not sure you guys are like,

10:23:35.840 --> 10:23:37.840
riefling rieflings, you know?

10:23:37.840 --> 10:23:40.840
And it makes me nervous and it makes me scared.

10:23:40.840 --> 10:23:43.840
But, you know, all as good as the,

10:23:43.840 --> 10:23:47.840
all as good for the Dutch people.

10:23:47.840 --> 10:23:49.840
Get fillered, get fillered, get fillered.

10:23:49.840 --> 10:23:52.840
And the holding it in one didn't get any flak.

10:23:52.840 --> 10:23:53.840
Nope.

10:23:53.840 --> 10:23:57.840
It was limited ads and I on a whim sent a judgement thing.

10:23:57.840 --> 10:24:00.840
And they let me put ads on, please let me hold it.

10:24:00.840 --> 10:24:03.840
And I literally say, let me hold your Pintas at one point.

10:24:03.840 --> 10:24:05.840
And they're like, yeah, that's fine.

10:24:05.840 --> 10:24:09.840
But me breathing in the mic is a violation of terms of service.

10:24:09.840 --> 10:24:13.840
So they have straight up, they have updated the terms of service.

10:24:13.840 --> 10:24:18.840
And they are not, they've not publicly said it.

10:24:18.840 --> 10:24:23.840
And it's resulted in people's entire channels like being deleted.

10:24:23.840 --> 10:24:26.840
Like ASMR people's channels is like the straight up deleted.

10:24:26.840 --> 10:24:29.840
Nay, nay warning, just a,

10:24:29.840 --> 10:24:31.840
sorry my stomach just farted if you heard that.

10:24:31.840 --> 10:24:33.840
Nay warning, nay none.

10:24:37.840 --> 10:24:38.840
I'm still a tight note,

10:24:38.840 --> 10:24:40.840
but you're already getting close to the 10K subscribers.

10:24:40.840 --> 10:24:45.840
I need to test if my iPhone can work in the bathroom then.

10:24:45.840 --> 10:24:49.840
Because I need to do my 10K special bath stream.

10:24:50.840 --> 10:24:53.840
Doing ASMR in the bath.

10:24:53.840 --> 10:24:56.840
Let's turn it into a bubble bath.

10:24:58.840 --> 10:25:01.840
You say that, but the thing I'm looking forward to the most is the hypno stuff.

10:25:01.840 --> 10:25:05.840
It's bizarre, hypno stuff is perfectly fine on YouTube.

10:25:05.840 --> 10:25:10.840
I'm literally gonna reprogram your brain temporarily to forget your name

10:25:10.840 --> 10:25:14.840
and respond to refling and YouTube's like, yeah, that's fine.

10:25:14.840 --> 10:25:17.840
But breathing in your ear every just...

10:25:20.840 --> 10:25:24.840
Even if I'm watching it two, three times speed.

10:25:24.840 --> 10:25:27.840
Oh my God, I must yap so fast on times three speed.

10:25:27.840 --> 10:25:29.840
It's not even real.

10:25:29.840 --> 10:25:30.840
It's fine, just don't breathe.

10:25:30.840 --> 10:25:31.840
Just don't breathe.

10:25:31.840 --> 10:25:33.840
Five hands, just don't breathe.

10:25:33.840 --> 10:25:36.840
I love the way I don't breathe.

10:25:36.840 --> 10:25:38.840
Yes, baby.

10:25:38.840 --> 10:25:41.840
No matter what I need, I need breath.

10:25:41.840 --> 10:25:43.840
Right, once this pops,

10:25:43.840 --> 10:25:48.840
I'm redirecting into lovely jubbly

10:25:50.840 --> 10:25:51.840
Let's see.

10:25:54.840 --> 10:25:55.840
I'm just checking everything's fine.

10:25:55.840 --> 10:25:57.840
Everything looks good to me.

10:26:01.840 --> 10:26:04.840
I got some shorts coming out soon, the girly.

10:26:04.840 --> 10:26:06.840
Which I'm excited about.

10:26:06.840 --> 10:26:07.840
I think I've already said that, sorry.

10:26:07.840 --> 10:26:09.840
I always repeat myself because I keep forgetting.

10:26:11.840 --> 10:26:15.840
I don't think the algorithm really uses what a creepling is.

10:26:15.840 --> 10:26:17.840
Just have some rest.

10:26:17.840 --> 10:26:18.840
I think you need it though.

10:26:18.840 --> 10:26:20.840
Okay, I'm going to sleep after this.

10:26:20.840 --> 10:26:22.840
I'm going to get a shower because I literally was sweating so much

10:26:22.840 --> 10:26:26.840
when I had my little cry over at John Wick.

10:26:26.840 --> 10:26:29.840
And then I'm going to go sleep.

10:26:29.840 --> 10:26:36.840
I'm going to wake up and I'm going to edit an audio of AC and Emmy together

10:26:36.840 --> 10:26:40.840
and pray that they both know what whispering is.

10:26:40.840 --> 10:26:45.840
Not naming names, but I've sent a few scripts away.

10:26:45.840 --> 10:26:47.840
And when I send a script,

10:26:47.840 --> 10:26:50.840
I put in big bold letters and highlight it in red

10:26:50.840 --> 10:26:53.840
and it says, please whisper through the whole script.

10:26:53.840 --> 10:26:57.840
And sometimes I get back soft spoken or talking.

10:26:57.840 --> 10:27:01.840
And it's actually very common.

10:27:01.840 --> 10:27:03.840
It's not just like the viewer who I'm collabing with.

10:27:03.840 --> 10:27:04.840
It's like really common.

10:27:04.840 --> 10:27:06.840
I'll put it in big letters, please whisper.

10:27:06.840 --> 10:27:10.840
And I'm like, so this is talking.

10:27:11.840 --> 10:27:13.840
This is soft spoken.

10:27:13.840 --> 10:27:18.840
You can still hear the thim in my voice while I'm speaking gentler to you.

10:27:18.840 --> 10:27:20.840
I'm whispering.

10:27:20.840 --> 10:27:22.840
Wow!

10:27:22.840 --> 10:27:24.840
We got 93.

10:27:24.840 --> 10:27:27.840
But whispering is when there's no thim to your voice at all.

10:27:27.840 --> 10:27:28.840
There's no...

10:27:28.840 --> 10:27:29.840
Uh-huh.

10:27:29.840 --> 10:27:31.840
Okay.

10:27:31.840 --> 10:27:32.840
Yes, but now you know.

10:27:32.840 --> 10:27:34.840
Okay, 93.

10:27:34.840 --> 10:27:35.840
Wait.

10:27:35.840 --> 10:27:37.840
Why are you like that?

10:27:37.840 --> 10:27:39.840
Oh fuck, there's not so much.

10:27:39.840 --> 10:27:40.840
I'll just hide it.

10:27:40.840 --> 10:27:42.840
I messed up so much.

10:27:42.840 --> 10:27:45.840
I'll fix it tomorrow.

10:27:45.840 --> 10:27:47.840
I'll fix it tomorrow.

10:27:47.840 --> 10:27:48.840
Please forgive me, right?

10:27:48.840 --> 10:27:49.840
What were we on?

10:27:49.840 --> 10:27:50.840
93.

10:27:50.840 --> 10:27:52.840
So, what is it?

10:27:52.840 --> 10:27:56.840
Next level is just shy of 8 million XP.

10:27:56.840 --> 10:27:57.840
That's quite a lot.

10:27:57.840 --> 10:27:59.840
I'm not gonna lie.

10:27:59.840 --> 10:28:00.840
I'm not going to lie.

10:28:00.840 --> 10:28:01.840
Congrats, Momay.

10:28:01.840 --> 10:28:04.840
You guys are gonna finish cooking faster than I am.

10:28:04.840 --> 10:28:05.840
Congrats.

10:28:05.840 --> 10:28:06.840
Now go to sleep.

10:28:06.840 --> 10:28:07.840
Soon, soon, soon.

10:28:07.840 --> 10:28:08.840
Like right now?

10:28:08.840 --> 10:28:09.840
Right this side?

10:28:10.840 --> 10:28:11.840
Okay.

10:28:11.840 --> 10:28:13.840
Hopefully my microphone...

10:28:13.840 --> 10:28:15.840
I'm actually gonna completely reset it tomorrow

10:28:15.840 --> 10:28:17.840
because I don't know why it's lagging, but...

10:28:17.840 --> 10:28:19.840
It is...

10:28:19.840 --> 10:28:21.840
I'm just gonna ventriloquist

10:28:21.840 --> 10:28:25.840
so my model doesn't react to my mouth at all.

10:28:25.840 --> 10:28:28.840
Actually, I don't even think I've set up my model

10:28:28.840 --> 10:28:31.840
to react to the microphone, which I should.

10:28:31.840 --> 10:28:34.840
You reach your level, so now you have to change the parameter.

10:28:34.840 --> 10:28:35.840
Exactly.

10:28:35.840 --> 10:28:37.840
That's just how it works.

10:28:37.840 --> 10:28:38.840
It just works.

10:28:38.840 --> 10:28:40.840
Call me Todd Howard, because it just works.

10:28:40.840 --> 10:28:41.840
Right.

10:28:41.840 --> 10:28:43.840
I will actually go...

10:28:43.840 --> 10:28:44.840
I'm gonna redirect into his work

10:28:44.840 --> 10:28:46.840
because I don't want to waste the opportunity

10:28:46.840 --> 10:28:48.840
in case she has had enough.

10:28:48.840 --> 10:28:49.840
Right.

10:28:49.840 --> 10:28:51.840
Thank you all so much for keeping me company

10:28:51.840 --> 10:28:54.840
through my absolute distraughtness.

10:28:54.840 --> 10:28:56.840
We're going to Night Night Cooking on this account too,

10:28:56.840 --> 10:28:58.840
but I don't want it to be my untrimmed.

10:28:58.840 --> 10:28:59.840
I have no idea what that means.

10:28:59.840 --> 10:29:00.840
But good luck.

10:29:00.840 --> 10:29:01.840
Yes.

10:29:01.840 --> 10:29:04.840
Thank you so, so much for hanging out with me.

10:29:04.840 --> 10:29:05.840
I appreciate it.

10:29:05.840 --> 10:29:07.840
Thank you for anyone that joined me in world

10:29:07.840 --> 10:29:08.840
3A free play.

10:29:08.840 --> 10:29:10.840
I do do the 3A.

10:29:10.840 --> 10:29:12.840
Unfortunately, I did recommend buying membership.

10:29:12.840 --> 10:29:15.840
I didn't understand that I didn't need membership to do cooking.

10:29:15.840 --> 10:29:16.840
That was on me.

10:29:16.840 --> 10:29:18.840
I was being a silly Billy,

10:29:18.840 --> 10:29:22.840
not thinking with my head and thinking with my willy.

10:29:22.840 --> 10:29:23.840
Thank you.

10:29:23.840 --> 10:29:28.840
Thank you so much for comforting me

10:29:28.840 --> 10:29:31.840
during the absolute pain that is drawn wick.

10:29:31.840 --> 10:29:34.840
Whoever said it is an action thing,

10:29:34.840 --> 10:29:38.840
liar, distraught, cannot comprehend.

10:29:38.840 --> 10:29:39.840
Okay.

10:29:39.840 --> 10:29:43.840
Cannot comprehend how distraught that movie has made me.

10:29:43.840 --> 10:29:45.840
How much did she cry?

10:29:45.840 --> 10:29:47.840
If you want to skip her back a little bit,

10:29:47.840 --> 10:29:51.840
feel free to listen to the moment where I realize that

10:29:51.840 --> 10:29:57.840
John Wick 5 is most likely a prequel and not a sequel

10:29:57.840 --> 10:30:01.840
because I was aware that John Wick 5 is a thing

10:30:01.840 --> 10:30:04.840
and I was like ha ha ha ha ha,

10:30:04.840 --> 10:30:08.840
but the ha ha ha ha ha part backfired horrendously.

10:30:08.840 --> 10:30:10.840
But yes, thank you so so much.

10:30:10.840 --> 10:30:12.840
I'm going to redirect into this error.

10:30:12.840 --> 10:30:13.840
She's currently playing League of Legends,

10:30:13.840 --> 10:30:15.840
so I'm sorry to expose you to that.

10:30:15.840 --> 10:30:17.840
I don't know what's so bad about League.

10:30:17.840 --> 10:30:18.840
I've never played it,

10:30:18.840 --> 10:30:21.840
but I guess it's a bad game question mark

10:30:21.840 --> 10:30:24.840
because everyone seems to complain about it question mark.

10:30:24.840 --> 10:30:25.840
I guess it's like Apex.

10:30:25.840 --> 10:30:26.840
Everyone's like,

10:30:26.840 --> 10:30:27.840
I don't want to see Apex.

10:30:27.840 --> 10:30:28.840
I don't want to see Minecraft.

10:30:28.840 --> 10:30:31.840
And I was like, well, I jumped on Microsoft for you.

10:30:31.840 --> 10:30:33.840
So how about you make a salt,

10:30:33.840 --> 10:30:35.840
let me make a salt you.

10:30:35.840 --> 10:30:37.840
That's absolutely awful.

10:30:37.840 --> 10:30:38.840
I'm going to go to sleep.

10:30:38.840 --> 10:30:40.840
No, I'm going to shower.

10:30:40.840 --> 10:30:41.840
I'm going to go to sleep.

10:30:41.840 --> 10:30:43.840
I've literally cried through all of the movies.

10:30:43.840 --> 10:30:45.840
I think the third one, what,

10:30:45.840 --> 10:30:46.840
maybe I peered up a little.

10:30:46.840 --> 10:30:48.840
Was the third one the only one I didn't really greet at?

10:30:48.840 --> 10:30:50.840
It looks like Azura's ending.

10:30:50.840 --> 10:30:52.840
Oh, well, I'm glad I caught that.

10:30:52.840 --> 10:30:54.840
Hold on.

10:30:54.840 --> 10:30:56.840
Hold on, Positunes.

10:30:56.840 --> 10:30:57.840
Hold on.

10:30:57.840 --> 10:31:02.840
We need to raid into someone.

10:31:02.840 --> 10:31:04.840
I'm going to shove you on Yumi plus.

10:31:04.840 --> 10:31:05.840
I'm going to go ask Yumi plus.

10:31:05.840 --> 10:31:07.840
Are you still playing Yumi?

10:31:07.840 --> 10:31:08.840
Yumi, are you still playing?

10:31:08.840 --> 10:31:09.840
What?

10:31:09.840 --> 10:31:13.840
Oh, my Yumi's went offline.

10:31:13.840 --> 10:31:16.840
I, me, is coming up.

10:31:16.840 --> 10:31:17.840
Right.

10:31:17.840 --> 10:31:18.840
I, me, is.

10:31:18.840 --> 10:31:19.840
If Azura's going offline.

10:31:19.840 --> 10:31:20.840
Yeah, she is.

10:31:20.840 --> 10:31:21.840
Okay.

10:31:21.840 --> 10:31:22.840
Thank you so so much for the little reeflings.

10:31:22.840 --> 10:31:23.840
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:31:23.840 --> 10:31:24.840
Please do not be surprised

10:31:24.840 --> 10:31:25.840
if I'm not doing an endurance runescape tomorrow.

10:31:25.840 --> 10:31:27.840
I will see how I feel when I wake up

10:31:27.840 --> 10:31:32.840
because emotionally distraught as I said.

10:31:32.840 --> 10:31:34.840
We might swap to Beltral

10:31:34.840 --> 10:31:35.840
because I'm absolutely addicted

10:31:35.840 --> 10:31:37.840
and I love it and I have so much fun

10:31:37.840 --> 10:31:39.840
with you guys telling me what's up.

10:31:39.840 --> 10:31:42.840
So thank you so, so much.

10:31:42.840 --> 10:31:44.840
I will talk to you tomorrow.

10:31:44.840 --> 10:31:45.840
Please look after yourself.

10:31:45.840 --> 10:31:46.840
Please hydrate.

10:31:46.840 --> 10:31:47.840
Please shower.

10:31:47.840 --> 10:31:48.840
Please do not strain

10:31:48.840 --> 10:31:50.840
when you go for a poopy

10:31:50.840 --> 10:31:51.840
or you'll hurt your butthole

10:31:51.840 --> 10:31:54.840
and hydrate and have more fiber

10:31:54.840 --> 10:31:56.840
that'll help with your little poopies.

10:31:56.840 --> 10:31:59.840
I don't know why I'm doing that.

10:31:59.840 --> 10:32:00.840
Why am I like this?

10:32:00.840 --> 10:32:02.840
But yes, I love you very much, reefling.

10:32:02.840 --> 10:32:03.840
Please do look after yourself.

10:32:03.840 --> 10:32:04.840
I will see you tomorrow

10:32:04.840 --> 10:32:07.840
and I'm going to redirect into Amy from Yumi Plus.

10:32:07.840 --> 10:32:11.840
As always, when I redirect into another strummer,

10:32:11.840 --> 10:32:14.840
they are not always at the same comfortability as me.

10:32:14.840 --> 10:32:15.840
Let's go.

10:32:15.840 --> 10:32:16.840
Okay.

10:32:16.840 --> 10:32:17.840
I will see you tomorrow

10:32:17.840 --> 10:32:19.840
for most likely Balletro, okay?

10:32:19.840 --> 10:32:20.840
I said it.

10:32:20.840 --> 10:32:21.840
I said it, okay?

10:32:21.840 --> 10:32:23.840
I mean, although we are actually

10:32:23.840 --> 10:32:26.840
like what, 11 hours away?

10:32:26.840 --> 10:32:27.840
Soon, soon.

10:32:27.840 --> 10:32:28.840
Right.

10:32:28.840 --> 10:32:29.840
I will see you at Giffy Givers tomorrow.

10:32:29.840 --> 10:32:30.840
Please hydrate.

10:32:30.840 --> 10:32:31.840
Please get snagged.

10:32:31.840 --> 10:32:32.840
Please brush your teeth before bed

10:32:32.840 --> 10:32:34.840
if you're going to sleep with me at the same time.

10:32:34.840 --> 10:32:39.840
And then we'll see what happens tomorrow, okay?

10:32:39.840 --> 10:32:40.840
Bye-bye.

10:32:40.840 --> 10:32:41.840
Bye, reeflings.

10:32:41.840 --> 10:32:43.840
Please look after yourself, okay?

10:32:43.840 --> 10:32:44.840
Bye-bye.
