1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,520
Pessing! This is how I sound over the game, in game audio of BALATRO. Not to be confused

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,680
with BALATRO because I can't read. Apparently the card in the middle is actually an A in

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,680
the game's title, so it's BALATRO, okay? BALATRO.

4
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:41,640
Ah! Jeez. The delay on when I click go live is astronomical these days, I don't know what's

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:53,200
going on. Pessing! Dear reflings, please type 1 on your keyboard to show that we're

6
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,120
synced. How was your royal flush? Terrible. I'm baking a loaf of bread because I've got

7
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,800
some issues. Okay, no see that was fast. I think it just takes a couple of minutes for

8
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:11,040
the dang thing to register. Right, so what I said when I click go live, but I don't think

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,560
you heard it, is the game isn't called BALATRO, the game is called BALATRO because it's an

10
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,100
A, the A's in the thumbnail is an A, and I've been calling it BALATRO because I've been

11
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,880
removing the A and the T because of the scots. I'm like, I'll be playing BALATRO, BALATRO,

12
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,480
any BALATRO players? That's her absolute shawls behaviour. Good morning, good evening, good

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:45,720
afternoon, I am none other than your huh, stranny cuddles. Now, originally on the agendination

14
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,400
it was Elden Ring, but unfortunately I have absolutely disastrous news, it's not disastrous,

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:01,800
it's not a big deal. I was up working after my beloved Mercy stream, if you guys did not

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,360
know, I got to stream yesterday with Mercy playing Goose game, and it was the worst type

17
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,960
or choice, or choice together if you want to say both words at the same time as I just

18
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:19,520
did there. It was the worst choice because Mercy has very severe motion sickness and

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:30,200
that camera angle would not stop spinning the entire gameplay, so poor Mercy had to

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,600
go, or I sent her off, I wasn't happy with it. But the long and short, if you missed

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,960
the Goose game with Mercy and you don't have time to watch the VOD, Mercy did a big scary

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,560
burp and both of us recognised what that burp meant and it meant her digestive tract was

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,200
getting ready to reverse due to her motion sickness, yeah like her motion sickness when

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
playing video games, but we had an absolutely fantastic time being Goose that one point

25
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,120
she was controlling me as a Goose, her controller input was moving me, so every time I tried

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,240
to move, I was pushing against Mercy's command, I was like who's hypnotising who you are?

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,640
That's not allowed, literally the reverse scrawny, that's not allowed. But it was an

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:21,040
absolutely lovely collab, I'm so happy. I also, the girls have a beautiful Uno collab

29
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,320
coming out next year, oh my god spoilers for next week's schedule, oh my god you're spoiling,

30
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,560
originally I was going to participate in the Uno, but I'm not anymore because originally

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,360
Shibi was, but then Shibi had a job, so Shibi couldn't do it, but then Shibi quit her job,

32
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,400
like an absolute boss, like a beast. So now she has time to do it and she's going balls to the

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,800
wall with streams which I'm so happy, I'm so glad for her success, special thank you to anyone who

34
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,560
has supported any of the girls, you are enabling them to level up in real life, unironically.

35
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,040
Because Shibi literally, speaking of poker, if you didn't know Balatro is about poker,

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,040
Shibi literally said I'm all in on Vehler, she's put all of her stonks in Vehler, so thank you to

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,000
anyone who is making such a risk worthwhile, whether that's clipping, whether that's interacting

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,720
with her posts, watching her vods because it generates money if you watch vods because there's

39
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,640
advertisements on them I think, I don't know, I'll need to check, I actually, so from the behind

40
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,240
the scenes, you can tell YouTube to place ads during a stream, but I say no no no no, I'll place

41
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
some YouTube, wink wink, I'll totally put ads down in the middle of a stream, I do not put ads

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,560
down in the middle of a stream, I don't like it. The VOD, I believe should play an ad at the start

43
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,840
and the end of the VOD, I don't know if it does it in the middle, I'll need to check that out

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,520
because I've been a knot in Ellie and I've not been checking. You did great with the girls,

45
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:05,600
oh stop it, stop it, did you do a royal flush, no, so I had to take, I was up working but I've got

46
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,960
two more ASMR collabs agreed upon, I sent away two scripts, I actually need to make an ASMR script

47
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,960
for Mercy because I came up with a really good YouTube ASMR roleplay script for Mercy that I

48
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,880
absolutely adore, so I need to work on that shortly. So originally it was going to be Elden Ring in a

49
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:38,880
12 hour stream but I'm like, I need to cook for these girls, I need to, I'm needing to tell them

50
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,680
there's possibility, there's a talent manager maybe coming in but I'm going to ask the girls

51
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,640
what they actually want because there's no point in getting this chicken, she's a Vtuber herself,

52
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,280
she does her own content, she has experience doing projects, that kind of thing, it's a she,

53
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:04,160
it's a she before anyone fucking says I'm in, they're replying to my email, you're not having

54
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,240
access to my daughters, okay. Kings Lupus, thank you for becoming a member, I appreciate it.

55
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,240
After two hours of Chucky Balattro, we are going to be doing membership ASMR and then I believe

56
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,880
that is my membership debt paid for the week, yarg. Originally next week I was going to watch the

57
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,640
Barbie movie, I might switch it out for something else and I need to decide on what series we're

58
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,640
watching during RuneScape which I'll be curious, I do have a cup of tea, can you hear my little

59
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:47,360
thingies against it? It might be good to delay the ER to let people enjoy the DLC first but you've

60
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
got 24 hours to enjoy because I'm doing endurance tomorrow so as the girls are on their own for the

61
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,320
next like week, I'm playing with my refunds in that opening shot case, I'm playing with my

62
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,520
refunds for a week straight, we're doing an endurance a week straight, we're joining my

63
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,080
games and you're all holding my hand, okay. I don't want to hear about anything from the girls,

64
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:14,720
sorry, yous are on your own, go speak to management, that isn't me okay, go speak to someone else

65
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,200
because I ain't me, I ain't me, I can't, that book is closed, I ain't talking to yous, I'm no interested.

66
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,080
Literally, oh you've got plans, don't care, don't care, not opening your DM, if I don't see it,

67
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:37,360
it's not a problem, kidding, I love you girls but it's been a long time coming that I could

68
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:45,840
play with my refunds again okay, so you're gonna have to, you're gonna have to give me some time

69
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,040
because the refunds have waited a very long time for me and it's been bloody nice being back so

70
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,080
do forgive me girls if any of you are lurking, I need my replin, my replin, my replin, please

71
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,280
don't die, you know like if it was like a little Sims 2 bar instead of environment because, or maybe

72
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,480
instead of hygiene actually, I've not had to shower in a couple of days, normally I shower at least

73
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,520
like every other day but recently, you know my little refill and bar is low and after endurance,

74
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,520
how you call it, endurance, Elden Ring, I will, I'll be good to go, okay, so right, I'm going to

75
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:40,640
drip drip drip, my honey tea, I have my script writing, my membership script writing stream

76
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,560
is coming up, I ask permission for the girls if they're comfortable with me writing stuff

77
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,520
live for them and I got a few thumbs up, I've got a few requests not to do everything which I said

78
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,040
no that's not, the reality isn't going to be like I'll do it all at once but that script writing

79
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:12,320
screen stream is most likely going to be roughly two hours, there'll be a bootstrip script, sorry

80
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:20,080
there'll be a boot script, there'll possibly be two ASMR collabs with other VTubers,

81
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,320
I actually need to write my one-on-one collab with the VLR girls because I've not actually done

82
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:34,160
that part yet, like I need to do my like, I want to do like, so for Emi, I want to do big sister

83
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,960
and little sister tease you with Tingles ASMR, I think that would be adorable, AC,

84
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,440
I wanted to do like, I actually want to see AC in a school uniform, that sounds really weird,

85
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,160
I'm sorry I said that out loud, that was an insane thought, I wanted to like AC to be like a weird,

86
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:05,280
not bully but maybe like some sort of like high school roleplay with me and AC together,

87
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,440
maybe like one of those like after school clubs and we were forced to come together to do it and

88
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,120
then like, AC grabs your phone and she notices that you watch ASMR and then like, well and we're

89
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,160
all just kind of like, well we either do nothing for an hour or we could just muck around and do

90
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:37,360
ASMR on each other, you want Gairu AC? Gairu? Yeah, Shibi, Shibi is my other half, I wouldn't,

91
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
what would I want to do with her if she's my other half?

92
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:54,640
What would we do? Maybe a blindfold type of roleplay would fit Shibi very well,

93
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,280
if you didn't know, I try and do the theme of the person I'm collabing with, I've actually

94
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,840
got a really good few themes, I did win with them, not to ruin it, I don't think she actually

95
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,400
streams at this time so she's not even gonna be awake, I did a hexa collab and at the end of it

96
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,040
we hypnotise you to mind break you and to only watching us and I thought that was really cute

97
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,960
but before you like, do you have to put a disclaimer, it's not it's not real like actual

98
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,200
induction or anything like that so I don't think there's going to be necessarily any induction

99
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,720
needed at all for it, sorry any disclaimer needed at all for it, also can we get one minute

100
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,320
silence for the cheek clap ASMR video, oh that's my best fucking audio, oh actually that's another

101
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:49,360
thing, I am editing my third audio that goes up like the day, I need to edit it after the ASMR

102
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,280
history, I've got like a lot of things I need to catch up on, I need to like send stuff to editors

103
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,440
and I need to do my own stuff and I need to do this and do that and look we're getting there,

104
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,400
we're getting there, per mimosa, per mimosa for one, she was the first person that accepted a

105
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:10,080
ASMR collab with me and sent me her lines and she must fucking look on her subscription list and be

106
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,520
like ah she's streaming for 12 hours again, yeah that sounds about right, per mimosa she has been

107
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,680
waiting patiently, I am going to try and finish everyone's that is on standby, today that is my

108
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:35,760
job, let me let me finish more of my tea, for Azura, I think double heartbeat would go crazy with me

109
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:46,240
and Azura and a kind of sleep aid rest between us type of audio, I think that would go incredibly

110
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:53,280
hard with Azura just from how naturally soothing her voice is, I would absolutely love to do something

111
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,160
like that and we kind of like do tingles as you, the listener fall asleep, maybe you're feeling a

112
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,040
bit rough and you're just eating some extra TLC, I think that would be good with Azura,

113
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:22,560
so me and Mercy are actually kind, we're not quite the same side of the coin with each other

114
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:32,400
so I want to hypnotize to Mind Break, she wants to break you in because you're resistant to her

115
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:42,320
so we've got a bit of a similarity, a bit of a lurking theme, I'm wondering if I could get

116
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:50,080
Mercy into a hypno, maybe Mercy comes to me because she needs help to hypnotize Senpai

117
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,320
because you're being extra resistant because resistant, if you didn't know resistant hypnosis

118
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,880
is actually quite big where it's like me the person speaking like acknowledges that you're

119
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,160
resistant so well but then you use phrases such as sooner or later you're going to break like

120
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,600
resistant, there's no point in resisting like this kind of stuff, any chance for ace marvin

121
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:29,920
yes please um yes those are my one-on-one collabs I actually used to do with girls,

122
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:36,720
Emmer's is about to go on holiday so I'm not gonna ask for that until she's over the hedge,

123
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,720
do you remember that movie?

124
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,240
Strony is a Bork confirmed, oh my god the Bork scared me so much but then they introduced Seven

125
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,240
and Nine and then oh the Bork turned the Bork turned me on so much, I love Seven of Nine

126
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,160
she my favorite, Penpal's about to suffer, Strony you using, well there's a bit of a

127
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,320
no, Strony uses a refland to demonstrate how to mind break someone so Mercy can, oh

128
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,880
see Mercy wouldn't necessarily, um actually no that's really good, fuck you I'm stealing that

129
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,560
I am literally copying paste in that and putting it in my little notes this gorge

130
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:34,880
this is for uh what's your name, Mercy Collab, Emi Collab is big, it is wee sister, oh sorry

131
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,800
little sister you can't, I don't think I could put wee sister because everyone would be like is she

132
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:49,440
passing, Emi Collab is little sister and big sister tingle you mercilessly, I see I want some

133
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:56,240
sort of like feral bratty, oh bratty school girl that makes much more sense bratty school, no it

134
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,440
doesn't make sense because it's supposed to be after school class, after school club goes wrong

135
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:16,480
and goes tingley, goes ASMR, sexual, it doesn't but you know what I mean, um Azura double heartbeat

136
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,880
sleep aid tingle layers reassurance for bad day nice and simple and then sheepsters

137
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,560
who goes there blindfolded um blindfolded tingle experience with

138
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,160
30 different tingles how about that 30 different tingles a little cheeky challenge

139
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,160
okay that is now in my notes discord so I can hold myself accountable to such dastardly acts

140
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,560
the girls are comfortable if I write certain scripts on stream and we can certainly do explore

141
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,680
those kind of things so you can quite literally get me and my VTuber companion to say what you

142
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,520
want to hear so don't be don't be afraid to um

143
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,520
mm-hmm right bilateral I don't know who the game dev is

144
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,760
shall we get into it I know how poker works I do not know how oh

145
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,920
hello there my name is Jimbo I'm here to help you learn to play

146
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,720
your goal is to earn chips and defeat the enemy blind

147
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,200
this here is a small blind you only need to score 300 chips to beat it

148
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,240
select the small blind to start the round okay thank you Jimbo

149
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,840
oh you earned chips by playing poker hands

150
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,440
each poker hand earns a base amount of chips multiplied by some multi

151
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,040
see your poker hands in the run info area along with other info what about your current turn

152
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,680
run info straight flush oh my god actually tells you how to play

153
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:20,400
what the fuck is a high card right straight flush um I understand a straight flush four of a

154
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:29,520
kind full house is three and two yeah flush is flush is five cards that share the same suit

155
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I'm gonna have to keep that in mind you know that straight straight five cards in a row consecutive

156
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:43,120
ranks but not the same three of a kind yes with two other unscorable cards that's fine

157
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,080
two pairs that's possible and you can throw away the fifth oh so you have to play five a pair

158
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,120
just simply throw away three but what the heck is if the plate hand is not any of the above hands

159
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,560
only the highest ranked card scores wow okay okay I'm not

160
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,720
okay cards also earn you some chips hover to hover over to see

161
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,600
now select now select up to five cards to play and press play hand uh we've got

162
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,360
have we even got anything we've got a double here uh can I not do anything with these trips

163
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:36,880
they're not a triple but whatever we'll learn oh shit I've just wasted them okay we're learning

164
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,000
relax I'm learning okay let's try that again you can also discard up to five selected cards

165
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,640
to try and make it an even stronger hand try it all right that's a double there eight seven six five

166
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,280
so what we need I don't know the two yous can go I guess

167
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,280
hey carefully you only have limited numbers of hands and discards per round

168
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:09,600
earn 300 chips before you run out of hands good luck okay right uh eight seven six five oh piss

169
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,240
I thought we had it uh we're doing all right we've got two pairs and then we'll throw away the three

170
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,280
I guess play hand

171
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,040
yeah don't have to play five oh you don't have to play five I'm learning oh god I've got two more

172
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:35,520
hands to play double see these are two doubles here oh I've also got that as well but kings are

173
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,360
kings are higher double than double five so just play hand play ball

174
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:52,480
oh oh oh jeez I'm almost gonna lose we have five discards

175
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,400
um honestly I'm tempted to throw like all of these away

176
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,280
and go for the oh what does this mean doubles two doubles and then just throw that in there for

177
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,720
the hell of it why no two doubles they should okay that's perfectly fine more than adequate more

178
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:23,680
than adequate that was a good throw away there we go we did it 300 I know it was very terrible

179
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,680
gameplay but uh cash out we got three dollars nicely done now that you are flush with cash

180
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,720
you can buy some new cards from the shop well but try buying this handsome devil

181
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,920
buy this is one of the 150 jokers that you can add to your run every joker does something different

182
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,120
this one adds four plus multiplier to every hand you play be picky you can only carry five joker

183
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,800
cards at a time okay now buy the other card from the show enhances two selected cards

184
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,800
oh wait ain't that not banged in the Isaac card this tired card is a consumable

186
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,600
cards at a time if you save up enough you can buy voucher voucher oh voucher vouchers passively

187
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,880

192
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:04,240
it so cartoony it's just one guy for the dev team shot up he came up with all of this that's fantastic

193
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:13,520
um select the big bind will earn some cash or tap or skip it to get a tag each tag has a unique

194
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,320
effect but keep an eye on the boss wind it has the ability you'll it has an ability you'll need

195
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,000
to plan around discard two random cards pair hand played oh wow okay and if you beat it then

196
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:38,640
the anti goes up and all blinds become harder ups the ante okay beat ante eight to win now

199
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,320
more cards remember you can rearrange the jokers trigger an order from left to right but we only

200
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,760
have one and make sure you use your consumables select after two cards in your hand and press use

201
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:14,640
on the territory to enhance them enhances two selected cards to multiply okay we have two jacks

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:28,640
already so we can use them as a pair wow they're scored now okay i mean we can submit two doubles

203
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:37,600
right off the bat why do we want to throw away though maybe just throw away the two for now

204
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:47,520
yeah shot we need four four hundred and fifty dollars okay oh that three was useless though

get to it right what are these the joker gains one multiplier pair consecutive hand played without

221
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,480
a scoring that is far too intricate for me this joker gains a multiplier for each card sold

222
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,200
that does nothing for me so what's about her permanently gain one discard each round

223
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
the um that looks good

224
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760

232
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,440
oh maybe just play every round uh are you making the clapping ASMR somewhere else

233
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,000

234
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,320
flush is the hard one that i'll never get so there's no point in doing that

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:37,040
um oh very bad hand very very bad hand indeed we've got a triple but that's it

236

239
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,800

243
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,920
because i didn't think it was possible

244
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:29,600
okay maybe i should have got that flush level three because that's actually pretty good

245

253
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,560
plus five hand size but reduces one takes away a round

254
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:41,200
wait about five extra cards in hand but reduces just by one round i feel like if i have five extra

255
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:46,800
cards i might understand in this right i will have five extra cards in my hand

256

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,760
what is a straight what's the straight uh or straight is one two three four five that's so specific

259
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,040
and it's so rare i'm like is there a point in me buying this if it's so rare and before it happens

260
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,640
in if i skip it gives a mega arcana plaque for free choose two of the five tarot caught in that

264
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,240

265
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,920
okay we're already halfway there wow um we can do a full house with twos

266
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:18,720

271
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:58,080
consecutive rank all the same straight four of a kind is higher a full house is actually higher

272
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:09,600
wow okay then a flush of the same suit a straight is wait what oh a straight flush and then a straight

273

274
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,080
four five six seven eight nine nine new terminologies that's five too many right and then it goes

275
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,160
straight and then it goes three oh no it doesn't go straight sugar because like that says 40 times

276
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:37,920
three oh wait because it upgraded pairs oh okay okay okay i'm gonna have to i can't believe it i

278
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:53,360
you mean minus oh but it reduces every round oh sugar okay i understand a bit more we got cash

279
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,520
we got six dollars i hear the cogs turning very slowly this joker gains when any booster pack

280
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,720
skipped like these

281
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,200
two plus chips for every remaining card in the deck

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:18,320
chips what's the check that two plus chips for every remaining card in the deck

283
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:30,320
a hundred chips extra that seems tiny chips are blue the blue area yeah oh this is this good then

284
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,240
multi is the red number wait that looks good then yeah that does look good hold on get that bad boy

285
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,560
in there right i i need to do this in order or something so apply four multiplier to everyone

286
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:55,680
and then add the blue so cute hearing you say oh sugar oh sugar i'm trying not to throw too much

287
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,760
because i feel like i do it like every sentence and i'm like hmm shouldn't be doing that thank you

288
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:11,760
broly legend for the tips actually wait this becomes useless it's gonna become useless so

289
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,320
uh this joker gains a multiplier when you skip booster packs and these are booster packs

290
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,360
uh i'm not really interested in tarot card choose to

291
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,040
spectral cards oh i don't even have enough is spectral cards my planetarium ones

292
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,080
right okay we can't do anything more this joker gains when you skip booster pack

293
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:46,800
hmm let me learn from my mistakes okay this is my first run choose your next uh bind up the ante

294
00:35:46,800 --> 00:36:00,720
raises all blinds refreshes blinds all diamond cards are debuffed so i can't i don't get anything

295
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:09,600
out of using them okay that's bad and not fun i have five discards

296
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,920
wow i'm a bit perplexed on what i'm supposed to do

297
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:24,000
diamond card fans see them diamond don't give points but it still holds their value

298
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,600
like if i played two pairs

299
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,160
40 times three and then what time 40 times seven

300
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,160
i don't know the two tens would be more valuable would they it's still 40 times

301
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,760
but the multiplier wouldn't apply scores no chips and all abilities are disabled on it so

302
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,680
i should do double sevens with a queen

303
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,680
i need to learn from my mistakes so i'm sorry if this is bad

304
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,800
i need to learn from my mistakes so debuff doesn't apply but the two sevens do apply

305
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:16,240
700 a thousand okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay double we did level up pairs

306
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,120
so i'm quite happy to just keep doing shout out to all my pairs god that's an old name

307
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,240
uh yeah right we all we leveled up pairs see pairs level two here and so i'm quite happy

308
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,400
to do the pairs right yeah another thousand okay we did it we did it we did it this uh i'm gonna

309
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,120
have to sell this when it doesn't give me anything because i assume it's gonna actually reduce

310
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:49,760
i made some two dollars one dollar one interest pair five bucks wait the okay okay great

311
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,160
voucher tarot cards appear no i don't

312
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:02,560
the first hand of round is if the first hand of round six destroy and create a spectral card

313
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,680
if first hand of round has only one card add a permanent copy to deck and draw it no i like the

335
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,280
i have watched people play it right if it contains a pair that seems pretty strong

336
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,280
but that is 30 chips though but that's tines eight multiplayer if i we do a pair though

337
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,520
tines eight multiplayer is big unless we sell that like right now

338
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:42,160
if we sell it to get the i think i think we're doing it i think we're selling it to get this bad

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:36,560
to put up like shorts pretty semi recently oh god this is a terrible hand if i play a pair but i only

346
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:49,200
have one pair i think we're doing a discard i don't normally discard but give us okay

347
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,920
double pair double pair i'll take a shout out to all my pairs let's try it so what happens now

348
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:02,000
eleven eleven ten ten a hundred good multi four multi sixty eight wow

349
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,400
wow okay okay that was a good choice doing whatever we did

350
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:22,960
uh once you start getting multiple mullies rather than uh addictive additive then it starts to matter

351
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,960
oh no yeah i don't think we're actually gonna win venus level up three of a kind i wouldn't mind that

352
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,880
i don't need the tarot card one and two chance to create a tarot card when a booster putting up

353
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,880
i'm happy to buy news venus i think we just need to level up like the base pair stuff

354
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,320
and then it means no matter what we do we're getting like a massive um buff basically you haven't played

355
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:04,000
three of a kind shit ah it's three of a kind not full house oh all heart cards are debuffed right

356
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,240
okay technically that's three of a kind and then that becomes full house

357
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:27,360
50 times five is 250 65 times six is lake 36 okay so it's better to play

358
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:38,560
okay it's better to do that even though it's debuffed

359
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,680
full house is there okay yes i was just confirming i was like try to do numbers

360
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,600
really quickly i'm like hmm my brain actually doesn't know how to do numbers like this

361
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,800
especially in the morning for the wee bit math don't you think okay that was good

362
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:02,480
whoa we already did it whoa i got an achievement called anti up because the ante is now four

363
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,200
joker unlocked ooh so you get to unlock more things ante off achievement unlocked

364

Saturn level up astrae voucher one plus hand size i think well three and ten

365
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:27,360
oh we have enough for both read trigger all cards and final hand over and what does that mean

366
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,280
what does that mean i don't know what that means right we'll do hand size

367
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,360
um after me measuring my hands on that one foot stream or that in real life

368
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,240
oh no was that this room no it was an american sweet stream level up straight yeah sure whatever

369
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,160
well we'll just level up basic stuff you know yeah cheeky cheeky level up is what i mean

370
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,280
i can do 1000 calculations per second and they're all wrong you need to build up your

371
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,240
interest it means if you're gonna lose it doubles the value of that hand have i got it oh i don't

372
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:12,640
have enough ah well skip explained rerolls the boss blind all club cards are debuffed 10 000 though

373
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,720
oh no i'm getting nervous i don't know if we're gonna win

374
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,640
uh i see nothing

375
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:37,040
five four three two and i don't have a one our king jack 10 98 sugar

376
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:51,040
do do i play a double right if i play this pair and then use the rest to just throw away and reset the

377
00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:01,760
oh that doesn't really seem like the best idea discard okay discard take get rid of that and get

378
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,640
rid of the nine and maybe we can either go high well okay okay okay okay all right let him get up let

379
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:16,160
him get up we've got an ace and two pairs level three that looks that looks good and then we'll

380
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:23,520
throw away one of the oh wait does someone say hearts no i don't have enough hearts okay uh i'll

381
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:32,160
throw away that in case we do end up getting hearts and um that's two pairs truly wait you have a

382
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:48,640
flush what's a flush what's a flush i do have five hearts i do i do oh i thought i didn't i checked

383
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,400
i checked if i didn't have a flush ah right king queen jack 10 9 what more could you ask for

384
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,600
oh i literally was like oh check if i have 10 eight five of the same but no i don't smile

385
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:13,200
uh exhausting to watch don't you just want to take out all your pent up frustration out on me

386
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:20,560
uh that's okay you can do it okay we got we got it we got we got it that's the main thing

387
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,960
played cards with hearts give a three multiplier hermit doubles money

388
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,720
choose one up to two joker cards

389
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,520
a joker for four bucks actually doesn't seem like a bad idea

390
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,680
a joker for two bucks doesn't seem for four bucks apologies

391
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,880
10 if the hand contains a flush the joker gains three chips per discarded club card that's so

392
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,320
specific

393
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,040
10 plus multiplier is big though

394
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:15,120
it's big but that if i discard a random club it'll give me three plus on the chip side

395
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,400
i mean

396
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,960
but that's 10 plus multiplier i pick the 10 okay thank you thank you you have influenced me right

397
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,040
all the multipliers go together multiplier multiplier multiplier and then chips and then chips okay next

398
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:42,080
round it rerolls the boss bane lane i i mean we've won with the debuff before so i don't see why

399
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,440
we would need to change it

400
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,360
trips check them

401
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,840
so throw away these

402
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,000
space space right surely that seems great fillers is much better than zero became

403
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,520
so discard

404
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,000
okay fill house let's go play hand play ball play hand

405
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:31,840
oh

406
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,320
oh i didn't make enough right okay okay okay

407
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,480
who's that six five four three two

408
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:52,320

409
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,760
yeah okay we won we won straight flush we won

410
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,240
six thousand for that okay that was good that was good i like that i like it do it again do it again

411
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,720
very winnable straight flush in hand foggy

412
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,800
is it rare oh no oh celeste deals up this joker gains a multiply every time the playing card

413
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,840
a playing card is added to your deck that's uh a curious one

414
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,560
iron two dollars pair discarded if no discards are used by the end of the

415
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:38,400
no i'm a bit bye this joker gains multiply every time a playing card is added to your deck

416
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,200
is that cute maybe

417
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,600
uh

418
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,120

udonis mercuries just appear a flush four of a kind i don't really get that lot

423
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,080
i think full house we seem to get a lot so i'm a bit biased towards earth if i'm being honest

424
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,840
yeah that's a good that's a good buff i like that do that again do that again keep going

00:53:55,840 --> 00:54:01,680
to get it okay sorry my apologies my apologies seven would have made that higher in retrospect

435
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,760
however uh we only need three thousand more so i think we've got it in the back question mark

436
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:17,360
we can do a double and a double like that and then with the added extras

437
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,600
uh let's just three four three we'll just throw away the eight while we're at it

a pair a street a four of a kind a street

450
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,240
i feel like we've got straight more than a four of a kind

451
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,680
Saturn or Mars straight or four of uh some's a Saturn

452
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:05,360
10 times in this economy exactly street is what i do a lot okay thank you we're level three on

453
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,200
straight let's go where so be right next round i've only got two dollars on my person so i'm not

455
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:27,280
i see a double bay i see a really weak double with these two that's so weak though

456
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:39,200
i think it might be a discard round one two three one two three four five you're out try again

457
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,680
no wait a minute that's not how it works is it

458
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,680
it

459
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,280
there we go there we go i thought i had to had to put up the queen there my apologies

460
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,200
i always like satin's satin's not clicking what's not clicking what's not clicking

461
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,480
okay we need 11

462
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:19,760
oh we're gonna need some multiplier jokers to come in because yeah we're not really rolling

463
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:27,920
and smoking six five four three so i don't have that have a jack double

464
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:39,600
yeah i think in two pairs well and then what try and get rid of this three down here as well

465
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:47,440
while i'm at it get rid of the three while we're at it get it out my out my face get out my way

466
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,320
i'm no i'm not playing with you you're too weak

467
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,720
i cannot do fast math in my head oh we did it okay we did it in two rounds that's not bad

468
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,240
i wouldn't mind like more multiplier jokers in place because

469
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,040
yeah i'm getting a bit going shakie oh

470
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:19,600
Uranus level up two pairs i play it so often i have enough for both i have enough for both

471
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:24,720
i love it here i love the economy in belt row that's so good i'm sorry bilateral

472
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,080
bilateral we love bilateral

473
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,800
what right a straight oh so you have a kind oh i'm thinking straight again

474
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:44,320
our flush daddy flushes often your anus is so back thank you

475
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,200
belt row goes hard it's too late for this game but generally your top row other than score in

476
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,400
the minimum points you need is a $25 for max interest your economy is super important in this

477
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:03,680
game ah you mean any hold on to my my money's and not spend at all but but i'm a woman that's

478
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:11,760
what we're supposed to do you tend to miss flushes straight would be better wait what you

479
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,880
tend i miss flushes so straight would be better right i trust you i trust you okay so i need to

480
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:26,640
hold money on my persons okay i will keep that in mind oh look it's the thing that's in Amy's

481
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,520
bedroom i remember when the bedroom creator came back with that and i was like what the

482
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,280
fuck is on the back of the room but uh it's like an actual thing next base edition shop

483
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:48,160
joker is free and becomes negative negative is one joker slot but that means i'm allowed

484
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,120
a six card is that no good

485
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:01,680
that's so powerful yeah the devil is actually ah yeah yeah uh it's like i already knew you were

486
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:07,440
going to say it like i said i'm on jokes your pair joker is negative

487
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,840
oh

488
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,320
does it mean like very very good if you're strong enough to skip

489
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,520
you already have a six joker slot oh i do and then this will give me a seventh

490
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:36,560
as long as the card is a negative but also for each okay fuck it we ball this is literally a

491
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:43,760
gamble game was gamble cards drawn face down after each hand is bro where's my hangman

492
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,560
does that mean what i think it means the cards are going to flip over on me so i'm getting a

493
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:57,760
piece of paper right now i'm not i'm not going in this blind okay the fish more like the fish

494
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,600
don't ever give me this mission again right okay

495
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,760
i see fuck all

496
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:21,680
okay i'm gonna have to ditch so we have an ace oh no pencil oh pencil please work with me

497
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:30,160
i don't have a pen oh i do have a pen i'm a weak fiver okay i'm gonna keep right we're gonna ditch

498
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:37,440
all you guys i know i do have a pair they're buying that leveled up we have an ace we have a 10

499
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,360
we have an eight and a seven surely this is gonna go well the new cards are drawn face down

500
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:54,800
i'll be shooting blind shut no way that's not even possible wait i can play this do i want to play it

501
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,400
i think you're fucked

502
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:08,000
did i just play this for points do not play the pair no no okay

503
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,440
you can use the shorthand discard good okay discard thank you thank you read thing

504
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:23,120
right we have an ace we have a jack we have a 10 an eight i have two sevens a five a three in a

505
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:33,200
two what is this hand look this is the worst i just want riddities honestly these are so weak

506
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,800
i think i want to go high and just get rid of all the low you know that

507
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,160
keep the sevens sevens are good

508
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,320
you can play less than you can play less than the five if i want to

509
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,320
you can dig for a flush i that's something throw the threes the five and twos but keep the sevens

510
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,360
okay it's not gonna be much of a shuffle that's my only

511
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,720
are you fucking fishing me i think i'm gonna have to play a double

512
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,120
i think i'm gonna have to do it so i've got an ace i've got a jack i've got a 10 i've got an eight

513
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,560
and i've got six yeah i think this is what i'm gonna throw away the six just because i don't want low

514
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:34,800
um boy thank you for the five gifted memberships congrats to the people who caught it with your

515
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:44,960
face in your face uh yegachad you've got lots of discards left i know but i get nervous i'm not

516
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:51,120
gonna do it in time look at her getting addicted to gamble i've become the very thing i swore to destroy

517
01:03:51,360 --> 01:04:00,800
i've got oh fuck it i need to earn some points fuck it ace jack 10 and eight

518
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,440
fuck it fuck it

519
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,360
oh puss that was

520
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:18,800
hello

521
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,320
is this probability

522
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:32,640
hah wouldn't it be oh i can't even get a royal flush that's not how it works

523
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:44,800
um it's sorted by rank okay so we know these are lower than eight and these are higher than

524
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:52,480
that use the sort button that's already at rank you can sort by suit

525
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,400
oh no

526
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,000
wait so that can give me a three suit no but you can't do that

527
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,760
oh man now it's a puzzle game bruv bruv

528
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,280
that was doing so well on this run but i don't think we're gonna make it you can discard the

529
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:27,600
face down cards wait they'll come back the cards will come back viewable i don't want to get rid

530
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,760
of these because they seem high discard all the face done

531
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,400
okay

532
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:52,560
it's very likely this is a king right if it's not we've got a double joker

533
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,160
is that how probability works

534
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:06,240
male's camera thank you for coming to member i appreciate it this come on

535
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:15,280
unbless we just played mega safe and do two ace and two pair that'll give me what 5k again

536
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,680
i'm needing a christmas miracle

537
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:28,800
no gamba all right gamba right what did i do ace king queen

538
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,040
oh that's not what i did at all right i can put down that card because i know for a fact either

539
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:42,160
way i've covered the thing so this has to be a king surely this is a king

540
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:55,200
oh we did it we did it gamba paid off we did it probability oh wait we only got 4k for that

541
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,560
that was so big though

542
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,160
that was so big

543
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:15,840
um i don't know if we're winning this one i think wait hold on rank if i do it by rank

544
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:23,040
these are all high again so the probability of a double riko thank you for the five gifted

545
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:30,080
memberships congrats to those who caught it with your face in your face that's totally not the

546
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:35,680
blue joker is coughing up blood at the moment is it this one

547
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:46,400
uh am i hemorrhaging the blue joker's um help yeah congrats on the memory thank you again

548
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:53,520
riko and boy for all the gifted memberships right if i do it by rank these two are whoa

549
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:01,360
what if you want to like number them out the wazoo oh then you can about this

550
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:14,960
uh i don't i'm not even looking right 10 and ace there's no way the odds are the game

551
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,560
the odds are the game actually can't give me another

552
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,520
flush

553
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:36,080
um can it give me a flush do we just gamble again but we're not making enough we're only

554
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,720
getting 5k per round i've got two more hands

555
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:48,160
oh math jumpscare honestly uh you know what we're playing a gamba game it's very unlikely

556
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,560
we're going to win this round so you we might as well go all in

557
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:58,960
how

558
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:08,880
how i'm not lucky like this i mean we're not going to make it because we don't have

559
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,280
um

560
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:20,640
math jumpscare this is impossible i think i'm just gonna have to discard

561
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:28,400
i don't want to discard the high though if i discard oh i don't want to discard the high

562
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:34,080
this is most likely a double nine here so these are useless but i don't want to take them out of

563
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:43,520
my deck clearly there's another straight there can there be there can't be oh

564
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:52,240
fuck it did we just do this and see if we get any like thingies i don't think we can win we're

565
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:59,200
we're so blind discard everything and pray yolo yolo i think just send it what we got

566
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:07,600
oh we could add a triple nine oh no i don't have enough good jokers for unfortunately

567
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:13,200
that was a good run though for that was a good run best hand that was so good

568
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:23,120
oh no were you bluffing too sometimes that is so good defeated by the fish yeah definitely

569
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:32,560
not wanting to go against the fish again that was rough right new run blue deck unlocked discover

570
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:39,680
at least 20 items from your collection one plus hand every round joker unlocked defeat a boss

571
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:50,960
blind in one hand without using any discards um i'm not sure i'm that good reach anti level

572
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:59,680
joker turret planet and spectral cards may appear multiple times um i had pretty bad luck with

573
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:12,800
jokers okay okay uh what what is this i'll just do basic red deck i don't oh seeded run i thought

574
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,720
this had speed run i was like steady on it i don't think i can do it speed thank you for making it

575
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,800
hard for me to work smile i didn't say anything bad i've never even said anything bad this stream

576
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,520
thank you really legend for the tip i've never even said anything bad this stream i've been good

577
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,480
doubles your money like that you can hold right i definitely need to hold on to my money a bit

578
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:44,080
better so gender norms you need a back off right now ace jack ten nine what two pairs i feel like

579
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,680
because it's like just the start we can kind of you know piss arse about i think

580
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,400
yeah we've got like three rounds we can we can play low games okay we can play

581
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:06,080
low games like low rounds it's not it is not um bad right nine ten jack i wouldn't mind getting a king

582
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,440
gonna be honest if we get a king

583
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:16,800
unless we get an eight then it would be a lower flush but

584
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,240
fuck it give me a hand uh uh

585
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:32,480
i'm not gonna have to play pairs shut up to all my pairs but the main thing was no economy yeah

586
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,480
you want to try and win in one hand because each time gives you an extra oh

587
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:43,840
keep an eight in case of an eight yeah i totally kept the eight what you're talking about what do

588
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:49,920
you mean you didn't see it it just walked away i know i should probably go for a king but

589
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,560
you know what it's the first round i think we win by default just because of how low the the

590
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:05,920
blind is it's so low like it's we can't really lose this famous last words famous last words we

591
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:12,800
can't lose this uh wait wait can i just keep playing pairs or am i actually gonna lose in the first

592
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,600
round please don't that's that's actually embarrassing please don't actually make me lose in the first

593
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:28,560
round okay it's fine it's fine we're here we're here um well just get rid of all these then

594
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:35,440
it's fine it's fine yeah there's see look we got a little triple oh we got a little full house

595
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:42,160
moment please see it's fine no no i i don't think i can lose on this the very first level i think

596
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:48,480
it's hard to lose there's three good weeks high straight high flush medium full house

597
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,960
yeah you guys are kind of i'm gonna lie reeflings i didn't realize your past time

598
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:00,720
was gambling gambling's quite bad didn't didn't you know gamble bad

599
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:08,080
see that hand size helps i don't want it

600
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,200
i'm gonna go and keep my economy

601
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:17,040
skip playing double your money no that's not useless for me

602
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:24,800
then save your money save your money i may quickly make a cup of tea after we lose this one

603
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,840
because there's no way i'm gonna be smart enough to actually win i refuse to believe

604
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,440
i refuse right what we got

605
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:45,280
after losing many hours to this game i found sticking to one type of hand and destroying cars

606
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,920
so don't match it with the devil arcana or other means it's a good way to help build a

607
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:56,640
consistent strategy for collector jokers are jokers locked for me thank you jobon

608
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:04,560
brian we love betting on mortgage no stroney i'll catch up later glad you liked my idea for the

609
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,240
mercy collab earlier go conquer big no we're not conquering big gang but thank you job

610
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:18,560
no go job no go job no go that sounds like an ace of martyr job

611
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:27,520
thank you for the 20 um yes thank you for your patience for watching me play this for the first

612
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,480
time i did watch another streamer play it for like two hours and i was like yeah yeah i can play

613
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:37,920
this game on stream mihu as soon as i hit go live completely forget all of the terminology

614
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,640
because you guys are like yeah flush are straight and all that and i'm like

615
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:48,880
i remember i remember that a phil house is going to do a three and a double four of a kind is well

616
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:57,360
four of a kind straight flush i need to get straight and flush flush is all the same but

617
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,880
straight flush is all the same in the same suit okay i just need to get my head right about flush

618
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,520
and straight flush the toilet because it's all the same color that's how i'm going to remember it

619
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,840
no i don't care if that's disgusting flush the toilet because it's all the same color

620
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,560
and straight numbers okay that's how i'll remember it when you guys are talking

621
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:28,720
that's how i'm going to remember it this is where i make my stand oh no keep the eight

622
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,480
people say keep the eight so i'll keep the eight

623
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:39,040
we've got a duplicate right we'll play the double oh wait i don't have a joker in place i may actually

624
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:48,240
lose this what so i just bend these i'll just bend these ones okay it's fine oh that's what i

625
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:56,640
wanted to see right what can we do we can do ten jack king queen ace let's go

626
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:05,520
flush like my whole face flushes with red when i see you okay that's probably a nicer way to see it

627
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:11,200
than a flush the toilet because it's all the same color half that man that's probably a nicer way to

628
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:23,120
put it uh wait again more on core on core on core straight on core it feels good man

629
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:32,080
okay i'll take it hopefully we can get a joker for multipliers in the shop because the the joker

630
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:41,360
cards are kind of definitely maker break the jokers are maker break one and two no don't care

631
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:48,240
um this joker gains three multi with any booster pack that skipped

632
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,760
i mean i skip booster packs or is this a booster pack even oh i guess that's a booster pack so it

633
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:05,040
doesn't count okay we'll just do celestia molest sorry um my brain just wanted to run

634
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:15,040
right a straight flush is when it's on in the same suit which is so rare three of a kind

635
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:22,240
isn't that rare four of a kind i think three of a kind oh wait but am i actually gonna do three of

636
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:27,520
a kind normally if i've got three of a kind i'm able to do a full house

637
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:35,680
intrusive thoughts are coming out i can't believe it hi stroney belcher is my favorite game hope you

638
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:42,080
like it i am so sorry for the gameplay you're about to witness i can only apologize it's my four of a

639
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:48,320
kind is also super hard three is more realistic yeah i um i'm biased towards venus because it's so

640
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:54,640
unlike straight flush is so unlikely and four of a kind i i don't think i've actually played one

641
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:00,960
four of a kind yet um so we'll just upgrade the most likely we've still got ten dollars in hand

642
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,880
so surely that means my economy is good right right all heart cards are debuffed i don't think

643
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:13,680
we're gonna do this we don't have a joker on the playing field yet we don't have one joker oh there's

644
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,040
our triple oh baby a triple we're gonna throw away these and play three of a kind

645
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,800
i'm gonna throw these away play three of a kind

646
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,200
right we're already halfway there let them get up let them get up let them get up right we've got

647
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:39,120
let's go that's how it works right we already did it okay we didn't even need a joker but i do

648
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:46,880
want a joker i do okay i really would like a joker please okay that was good that was good

649
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,760
spectral cards can shape your deck to increase the likelihood of four of a kind oh i don't know you

650
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:59,040
could do that uh the cards are in my favor and before i have a really good lucky seed then i

651
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:07,120
mess it up i went nine for that one two dollars interest for every five dollars in my thingy i

652
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:14,880
get an extra dollar that's good don't feel bad enjoy watching you learn this is a game where it gets

653
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:22,400
easier the longer you play or at least you understand it better oh thank you for your patience jubo no

654
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,400
i can't say this reptiles fast thank you for the tip again yes and thank you everyone for your

655
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:35,440
patience i really enjoy being i get full house often

656
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,920
i get full house often yankers i get full house often please

657
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:52,160
yes no i'm actually really thankful for it because like i don't get a lot of time to play well this

658
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:59,600
sense well now that i'm a vtuber i get plenty of time to play games for the first time but before i

659
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,720
didn't hardly have every time like to like just be late i don't want spectral packs we'll play

660
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:11,040
like i just never had time for it but now i have like all the time to like like look at these games

661
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:15,040
and be like you know what i'm actually interested in playing that game this game that game right i've

662
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:22,560
got eight now i want to throw a nine away that seems a bit harsh i'm a better throw at the

663
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,920
pair away but i feel like the nine's just randomly sitting there

664
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:34,160
what what do my my trusted advisors the reeflings advise

665
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,760
your hard work paid off by the way have you seen that one banana game that's trending on stream

666
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:46,960
no someone says keep the name the message after it chuck the nine wait what's the banana game

667
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:53,280
Danny to look it up you could also keep the clubs oh you're right

668
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,160
surely we will score another club

669
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,560
surely we will score another club

670
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:15,200
i'm gonna regret doing the club route you know that i'm gonna regret them can i just play that

671
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:23,520
it's only gonna give me what like less than a hundred if i play that

672
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,760
if i play the just play the two pairs okay okay okay okay we'll play the two pairs

673
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:36,400
and we will throw away the three i'm gonna try and throw away the four and whatever hand i get

674
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:43,040
next as well because it ain't whatever we tried to do any time it's no happening so might as well

675
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:51,760
try and get rid of the low so we can have a hand fuller we have a triple and we've got the freaking

676
01:22:53,040 --> 01:23:01,040
buff of it i don't have a double no yeah okay and then we'll just throw away the six and the four

677
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:09,280
yeah that seems right yeah yeah i'm getting MLG right we do need a joker though i would

678
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:17,280
very much like a joker joker joker if you'd like to show up a decent joker um we do have

679
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:26,000
three discards we have a double of a we do not have any suits coming into play i think i'm happy

680
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,400
to just throw those away wow

681
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:40,080
wow i mean might as well just throw those away because we've got a queen to follow up right after

682
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:44,720
don't mind if i do don't mind oh wait it's a full house

683
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:54,400
wait ace is standing is anything for a full house i'm oh wait all i had to do is play double queen

684
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:00,800
i'm sorry i'm but we did it we won i'm so sorry i apologize wow we got three extra dollars because

685
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:07,520
of how much money on my hand i'm sorry but we did it anyway that's the main thing oh my gosh

686
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:16,720
oh my god the game is tempting me so hard right now i'm so i'm so tempted to go out

687
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:23,280
the inner inner women was it do they call it retail therapy the retail therapy is going

688
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:28,640
hard right now please please let me cannot buy them all please please reeflings let me buy all the

689
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:35,200
four of them please for me i've been such a good streamer i've been streaming everything

690
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,560
no don't say no to me say please i said please

691
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:49,280
very concentrate on a specific hand are you serious oh come on let me go for it it's retail

692
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,480
therapy right i'm going for it i've been a good girl sorry but most removed like oh i need to

693
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,960
break streaming so stressful uh no i need to play more with the reeflings they need to hold my hand

694
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:09,440
through games fuck off move aside i need to keep streaming okay so let's still pack right full house

695
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:18,720
high card i never play high card three of a kind or full house full house if we invest in earth

696
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,760
then full house offers more than what a base three of a kind can offer anyway because you're

697
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,280
getting extra two thingies in it

698
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,280
a fucking earth card desune

699
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:46,080
oh no i've only got nine so i'm only gonna get one dollar the fact i don't even have a joker yet

700
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:55,360
is shocking create up to two jokers must have room create but does it mean use the two jokers

701
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:03,120
i might have to do that if it means it gives me two jokers i think we might have to

702
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,640
do

703
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:10,800
yeah skip skip okay right give us these jokers because we need it

704
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,760
whoa one of them's turned off are you okay

705
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:24,000
oh person 20 multiplier if the hand contains uh three of a kind okay

706
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:34,800
50 chips if the plate is a pair yeah we needed something of this nature so maybe we'll go for

707
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:44,880
trip check on boys um triple triple triple we've got a duble of a but it's two i don't want such a

708
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:51,360
low duble of a it might not be obvious but you can sell jokers if you don't want them and i'll

709
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,320
sell them once we get like better things to replace them with not three of a kind

710
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:02,000
only if you play three cards or less wouldn't that be three of a kind then i'm so sorry

711
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:11,920
contains a pair a pair contains three of a kind it's three or less cards so a pair in a single

712
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,920
card would also work to activate you

713
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:28,160
do i discard you can play a pair playing a pair of two with one of them debuffed is like

714
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:36,720
rough though i think i'm gonna throw all these away play the twos oh no you say play the twos

715
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:45,440
do it let's just play the twos see the power okay reef flings i'll see the power we're playing

716
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:58,720
three so that should activate we're debuffed on the two debuff right that was the weakest thing

717
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,240
i have ever witnessed in the game said aye that's fine

718
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,760
whoa so if i do this i win

719
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:22,880
whoa jokers are maker break holy crap jokers are maker break

720
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:31,600
okay and we get a little bonus dollar as well yes we did so we got eight payout that's good

721
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:38,640
oh my god the game is tempting me stop it what is this one consumable slot no i don't really mess

722
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:49,280
with that high card i never play a flush oh it takes me just under 15 it takes me just under

723
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:54,880
15 so i'll miss out the three dollar bonus but i want to i want to try the buffoon pack

724
01:28:56,240 --> 01:29:01,760
choose one up to two jokers oh fuck it we ballin right let me get this one and then we'll try the

725
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:13,440
buffoon as well oh my tummy hurt am i experiencing a hunger i might be adds double the rank of the

726
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:24,560
hand to multi to do jog oil change karate eat candy ruminate earn four dollars if poker hand

727
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:33,440
is a two-payer poker hand changes at the end not sure about that one add is double the value

728
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:41,040
the left one's pretty good i am inclined to also want to pick the left one the fist okay please

729
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:49,280
fist me okay thank you i'm sorry um and we will get two dollars per every round played

730
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:57,120
and just to add double the rank on the lowest so that's a multiplier so we're going to have

731
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:09,760
the multipliers together and then the chips that side um upgrade high card by three levels

732
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,400
but i don't play high card i never play high card

733
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:22,000
i feel like high card is like a hail me unless wait hold on hold on

734
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,600
that 20 multiplier would come into play if i played an ace like an ace on its own

735
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:38,480
hold on a minute hold on a minute this might actually be worth it if i'm not mistaken

736
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:48,800
this 20 multiplier as well as high card it won't help with the pair of joker as it won't scale

737
01:30:48,800 --> 01:31:04,960
very long yeah but no chips oh true right let's focus on duplicates and trips okay we'll focus on

738
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:13,440
doubles and trips thank you for your your um right we already have a double ace if i play double

739
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:23,440
ace and throw away the five with it add the double to the lowest rank held in hand to the

740
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:29,280
multiplier so it has to be a two which is fine i'll take a two uh right we'll get rid of the five

741
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,080
just to clear a few things up in the hand don't forget to check your run info why yes of course

742
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:42,160
so two pairs is what my strongest contender but the multiplier isn't actually that big

743
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:50,320
oh sorry my apologies four full house is my biggest earner we are starting to level up

744
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:59,520
quite nicely i'm enjoying it uh i think we'll throw away the five um

745
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:11,200
yeah sorry this multiplier comes in very strongly if i do the five option skipping around is very

746
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,040
impactful because not only do you lose money but you also lose your chance at seeing the shop as well

747
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:22,240
oh okay okay maybe that's why i was like hardly see any jokers um jay to the torn card do you have

748
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:30,160
a kind as your hail mary full of grace someone sent me um something on marsh mallow and it's like

749
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:41,440
hail strongy my comments with you what how we've already won that was just one goal and we get an

750
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:48,800
extra two dollars and remaining we got eight for that that's fantastic oh no i'm getting four of a

751
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:57,840
kind i'd never get a chance to play four of a kind though what are you play aces give 20 oh wow

752
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,080
four multiplier as well as 20 chips

753
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:14,320
oh i'd buy the spectral pack and nothing else are you spectral pack player i'm only celestial

754
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:19,840
him in the planet booster still leaves you at 10 so i would still get double

755
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:26,880
you're right i'm going to do celestial pack and joker this joker if he comes in correctly

756
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:32,800
so that's a multiplier so i want it to be in front of this guy

757
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,040
and then that's a little thing on top

758
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,560
wow okay okay let's let's see what we've got in here

759
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:55,280
we have a high card i don't play a straight flush i don't and a straight straight definitely straight

760
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:01,520
but a straight flush is next to impossible odds i'll take a straight though

761
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:08,400
right let's do it let's see what we're up against

762
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:16,640
3000 or gives a mega arcane pack which i am not fussed for personally three aces is the ultimate

763
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:22,160
hand for you now speaking of aces i got nothing

764
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:31,600
double nine audit is it like is it valuable enough or just throw all these away

765
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,920
would double nine be valuable enough

766
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,720
pair yeah i'm like honestly and then i'll throw away the two just so it's not in the way

767
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:49,440
let's see what let's see let's see what happens if i do just double nine what kind of monies do we get

768
01:34:51,280 --> 01:35:02,160
okay why it's so big so if i get to play an ace it also a double ace well we'll do double 10 and

769
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,840
then that's what's done already

770
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:10,240
we have made pairs so OP honestly

771
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:16,080
literally have made pairs so OP we don't even have to do anything

772
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,040
oh this is so good

773
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:27,520
oh we got extra four bucks as well four and then remaining hands

774
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:36,320
ah yes okay so that so if i'd managed to do it in one i get three max dollars and if i keep a lot more money on me i get more

775
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:45,120
okay okay okay okay i'm getting tempted though joker tarot planet and spectral cards can appear multiple times

776
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:48,160
don't care one in four chance for a holographic

777
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,920
but it can fail

778
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:05,120
if it fails i waste three bucks but i'll still be but i'll make it back naturally complete in the round

779
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:13,120
so is it really gambling is it really gamble if i don't actually lose out on the money in the next round

780
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,480
the wheel mathematically never go for the wheel but technically i make it back by default so it's not

781
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,480
really gambling it's not really gambling

782
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,320
whoa it put on the best one

783
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:40,240
it put on the best one streamer lock streamer lock streamer lock identified

784
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,480
play only one hat okay i can throw a ton of stuff away though

785
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,640
wait i make 2000 with a low pair anyway

786
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,800
okay let's throw all this i saw away i just need an ace that's it move one

787
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:11,040
move one that's it that's all we had to do even though the game said play one hand

788
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,800
easy peasy leaven squeezy

789
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,120
wow 6000 for double aces

790
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:22,800
wow

791
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:31,280
oh my goodness we got five bucks for that and we got our three bucks back so our gamble heck and

792
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:40,480
paid off on that we're now in the 23 what's this v-roll boss blind one time but it's cost

793
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:48,880
to do it right what are you hundred chips if played hand contains a three of a kind

794
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:57,200
that's actually not bad for our build but we are going for pair a pair yeah we are going for

795
01:37:57,200 --> 01:38:10,880
a pair should have upgraded the pairs i don't really go for flushes maybe there's a pair in here

796
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:18,800
gamble for the pair what's in here let me see a pair so i want to level up pair now don't i

797
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:24,800
buy or three of a kind pair or three of a kind

798
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:38,960
pair or three of a kind pairs i know the pairs are just so op you want all the mercuries got it

799
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:45,440
loud and clear loud and clear mercuries are the way it go right right right right what are you a

800
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:55,680
flush i don't even need you anymore do i know now this one does have my interest because there may

801
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:10,800
be situations where a triple will come up i'm tempted i'm tempted arcane for easy win choose

802
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:15,440
choose one of the three tarot cards to be used might as well seems good right okay

803
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:22,320
that's our five jokers which i'm happy with so if it's a pair i get 50 if it's three of a kind i

804
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,120
get 100 so these actually conflict a little bit maybe that wasn't the wisest idea

805
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,680
oh dear maybe i shouldn't have done that you know what you live in your learn let's go next

806
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:47,520
you live in your learn 5000 create creates two jokers to choose from though oh that's juicy

807
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:55,600
uh three of a kind gives you 150 because both of the jokers apply oh wait i don't want new jokers then

808
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:03,840
uh you don't have room yes i would have to sell so let's not do that let's not skip around

809
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:10,080
we'll also get three bonus for how much we won we won already did we win already

810
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:24,160
play did we get 5000 just we do because we got 6000 last time

811
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:35,680
seven thousand when we won first hand okay okay i like this game this is getting

812
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:43,280
ye this is getting jesse look we got an extra six dollars bonus i was gonna skip that as well

813
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:50,320
thank goodness i didn't choose one of the playing cards to add to your dick re-triggers all the cards

814
01:40:50,320 --> 01:41:01,840
i don't really quite comprehend at random he can apply a multi depending on what time he's putting

815
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:16,240
re-triggers good with your joker whenever the fire rises you know i feel like i would have

816
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:26,320
to sell that one though for him yes that makes sense to sell him in order of a higher molly

817
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:36,400
yeah okay get rid of him add you you crazy card you i'll pop you right there because

818
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:41,840
these are both chips and these are mullies oh wait does he need to go in front of him

819
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:50,800
because he does chips as well right what is a jumbo saleth pack i am very happy to see you

820
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:57,840
whatever you are it just means there's a lot in it mercury um i'm going for you i'm all in on mercury

821
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,480
yep all for you baby

822
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:13,280
oh i doubled it up twice that's fantastic okay order doesn't matter with these particular

823
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:21,600
jokers okay the blank gives a dollar pair unused discard this run will give 29 bucks

824
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:25,600
i get 29 dollars with a skip this

825
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:36,400
take the 29 and run that's worth it okay don't have to tell oh wait but i don't have a shop

826
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:48,720
but that's okay because cards played previously this ante are debuffed so just do aces once

827
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,480
ah wait no

828
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:09,600
my aces don't count what do i do uh it's just two aces that are due discard for pairs right

829
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,920
i'll go for high pairs i know that's one there but

830
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:17,360
discard again

831
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:26,080
discard and triangle for higher pairs up here that seems like the smartest thing i can do

832
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:28,800
yeah that

833
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,600
i want another ace to appear

834
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:40,640
not me being able to do a royal flush oh sorry that's a straight my apologies

835
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:50,320
do i get actually you know what get rid of this ace that doesn't work and then when the double ace

836
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:57,760
comes through that'll be better so this isn't a lose lose this is still a good move it gets rid

837
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,400
of all these cards and it gives me a higher chance to roll an ace that isn't affected no

838
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:13,360
no wait no yep discard the other ace just discard the ace and use a regular ace

839
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:19,840
just keep the ace level three straight is good though yeah

840
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,800
better to discard the two

841
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:34,480
oh i'm conflicted on what to do i guess straight doesn't work with your jokers though but i do have

842
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:41,840
that no there's straight is good oh fuck it sorry i don't know if i'm gonna mess this up i don't

843
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:46,320
know if i should get rid of this ace and then in hopes for an ace that isn't debuffed though

844
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:49,760
straight doesn't work with any of my jokers though

845
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,040
mm-hmm

846
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:58,720
mate i'm gonna do this to clear my hand i have three more yeah i do have three more turns i'm

847
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:08,480
doing this to clear the hand on purpose okay on purpose i am clearing the hand i got five thousand

848
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:14,000
that was decent if i can just get there see boom what do i get if i do double ace

849
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:23,360
uh-huh let them numbers keep going up baby uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh

850
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:30,480
wow okay it worked it worked it worked it worked it worked it worked and you got any

851
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:38,800
doubt or wait so if i have 45 in my pocket how much bonus that yet oh max of five which is 25

852
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:49,920
dollars still low um planet cards appear two times more frequently yes i want to upgrade this shiz

853
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:58,400
out of my uh planet cards so yes i will take you what i do with you planet merchant redeemed yes

854
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:05,920
what a okay i don't put it anymore try a death card select two cards convert the left into the

855
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:13,120
right that is confusing but i will take your word for it uh choose one up to three tarot cards

856
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:19,360
to use immediately maybe if we get the wheel of fortune because there's no point in being less

857
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:28,960
than 25 so i'm down for the wheel of fortune gamble will we try that tarot is so good let's see open

858
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,680
huh

859
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:42,320
creates up to two random playa planet cards must have room for a planet card

860
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,800
i don't think a planet card means what i think it means

861
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:53,760
compare up to three selected cards to hearts i mean i could do a straight well i don't want

862
01:46:53,840 --> 01:47:00,640
a straight flush i've got triple there use the death card now convert two cards

863
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:05,440
select two cards convert the left card into what the right card is

864
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,360
oh no planet no not yet

865
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:20,320
astronomy didn't have another stream in 10 minutes oh my god i have to do membership

866
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:26,560
somewhere right we're gonna lose anyway but it's fine use the high priestess okay

867
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:35,040
we got earth for it a full house but we don't even i mean sure use it why not

868
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:42,240
it's kind of it's not here nor there you never know i might come in clutch in case we completely

869
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:48,000
i complete i'm getting too sucked into this game so what are you pick up to three playing cards to

870
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,480
add to your deck let's just explore we've got the money to explore let's explore

871
01:47:54,400 --> 01:48:00,880
if i play the nine of hearts it gives me nine chips sure why not

872
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:10,640
enhances one selected card into a steel card sure why not get get on get on in and you come

897
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:31,840
just play this you could have enhanced and then copied yes we are learning we are learning

898
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,960
but we did it that's the main thing we got our cheeky bonus five dollars as well so

899
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:47,040
planetarium upgrades are getting pretty pretty on the house um convert increase the rank of

increase the rank of up to two selected cards by one can i put that on aces strength on

902
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:09,840
and turn kings into aces as well stop i'm gonna cream is that real

903
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:21,120
that re-roll could upgrade kings to aces okay i am learning i am tempted to re-roll honestly

904
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:29,840
if we if going below 25 doesn't count then okay plow no i don't play high cards that was rubbish

905
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:35,760
the joker gains three trips pair discarded diet that nah right okay that was always the money

906
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:45,120
we are not rolling again uh no i do not need that or do i do i need that for the fish draw

907
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:53,840
cards face down after each hand played i need that for the next round to ensure i win

908
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:05,440
shouldn't need to skip you only play pairs so no it's not worth it okay right if i have a king

909
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:14,720
i can upgrade it oh yeah if i have a king no three of a king bum bum bum

914
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:52,080

915
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:57,120

give me a second let me cook let me cook we actually might be winning this somehow

917
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:08,320
i actually don't know how the game like what the end in game is is that the ante is eight i think

918
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:15,920
eleven dollars feels good man what we got all cards are considered face cards what does that

919
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:24,880
even mean can dig for kings with the fish she's getting addicted me addicted you have to be eight

920
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:29,520
boss fights beating ante eight is the end so we're already halfway through

921
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:35,360
should be able to uh with when all the kings become aces you can one shot give me mercury

922
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,360
mercury mercury shit

923
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:44,960
maybe i'll just put it on saturn then and then a straight would be a hill mary

924
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:52,000
oh dear well we tried yeah well straight's getting pretty big um

925
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:06,320
some jokers care about face cards it's a buff face cards don't matter with my jokers though

926
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:13,440
she's hooked the fish is on the hook so if i refresh it doesn't refresh the celestia pack

927
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:20,240
i'll just use this right i'm not afraid re-rolls don't don't do anything right level up my king

928
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:29,920
level up my king as long as i roll the fucking king right increase the rank of a card

929
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:37,920
increase the rank of up to two selected cards by one so do it on the eight as well while i'm at it

930
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:49,760
you can do two kings so get rid of all this you can upgrade two kings discard from more kings yes sir

931
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:58,320
say no more right okay slight kings strength use on the kings please

932
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:13,520
oh it's a good day down in philadelphia are we looking good discard the law three aces let's go

933
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:21,520
let's go oh show me what we're getting maybe can we do it in one can we do it in one

934
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,760
oh

935
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:40,080
shit what i really don't want to lose against the fish seven aces are now in a deck though

936
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:50,080
discard for pairs i don't want to discard the high though because they could be a

937
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:54,880
are you sure discard the face up everyone saying discard for pairs

938
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:03,920
i'm worried about them being aces and like throwing that away

939
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:11,280
i don't know if i discard the lower cards right let me discard these ones

940
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:16,880
and then that pushes me to most likely have high

941
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:27,360
can i test it right i'm going to test what we get if i do tens okay because ten is safe

942
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:32,800
let me just test it out let me see how it goes what happens if i do tens

943
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:42,480

976
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:11,680
no i upgraded one king but one king acts like an ace now enhances two selected cards to lucky car

977
02:01:12,640 --> 02:01:18,720

979
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:32,880
tarot card to these aces for the hell of it and then we'll see what happens whoa they're

980

982
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:52,160
odds oh no how good your beat is

983
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:59,920
i'm gonna have to upgrade mercury if i'm wanting to keep up with how big these um

984
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:07,040
blinds are getting lucky didn't proc but next time next time okay i'll just throw the jacks i think

985
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:13,200
they're gonna be fine they are worn out that's what makes them lucky oh you got 20 plus multiplier

986
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:22,720
from them oh i did not see oh i'm gonna start lagging behind if i don't get some upgrades

987
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:27,360
that took me three three rounds to get

988
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:37,040
i'm gonna have to start spending at the shop the shop's gonna have to start giving me the goods

989
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:43,680
because that was quite a few attempts my economy is high so that's giving me the extra five every

990
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:49,280
time which is good not gonna lie it is the first girl's addicted to gamble he's the most

991
02:02:49,680 --> 02:02:54,800
i'm probably more than one free reroll in the shop yeah bloody like that wouldn't

992
02:02:54,800 --> 02:03:03,040
know i don't want to reduce my hand size but oh if i would wait hold on hear me out if i reduce

993
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:09,680
my hand size by one we still are only rolling for aces and we can still discard five at a time

994
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:17,200
and if the ante is less it means i don't need to get as much at the moment which is what i'm kind of

995
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:29,520
needing oh that's not hand side that's hands numbers that i can play oh no i don't like that then

996
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:36,480
no sorry i don't like that can i get an ace i get a cheeky ace ace ace don't be shy give me a

997
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:40,320

999
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:54,640
ten chips three dollars with the card no i don't need it like that

1000

1001
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:08,080
i don't go for one and four though my everything's on ace because of my ace card

1002
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:12,720
we're yeah here if i play aces i get insane like i'm uh i'm not gonna try and

1003
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:22,640
wait are you telling me to do math the purple jack is a tarot if discarded

1004
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:28,400
no if it's held in my hand creates a tarot as well yeah

1005
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:38,000
is it a poly what are you saying is it a polychrome glassed four are you memeing or is that real

1006
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:46,720
is that a real attribute to this game or am i being frigging it's read strawny read ten right jack

1007
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:50,960
of clubs ten plus three dollars if this card is held in your hand at the end of the round creates

1008
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:57,440
a tarot card when discarded however wait so they conflict i already have a purple seal on a jack

1009

they conflict if i hold on to it i get money if i discard it i get a tarot just take the purple

1010
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:10,960
where i'm listening to you so i'm getting i'm getting all confuggled i'm no smart enough for this

1011
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:16,960

02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:07,200
we couldn't come back from the yeah 2000 oh not even 50% jeez lol time for us to shuffle off and

04:17:44,160 --> 04:17:45,160
How about one more time?

1362
04:17:45,160 --> 04:17:46,160
How about one more time?

1363
04:17:46,160 --> 04:17:47,160
How about one more time?

1364
04:17:47,160 --> 04:17:48,160
How about one more time?

1365
04:17:48,160 --> 04:17:49,160
How about one more time?

1366
04:17:49,160 --> 04:17:50,160
How about one more time?

1367
04:17:50,160 --> 04:17:51,160
How about one more time?

1368
04:17:51,160 --> 04:17:52,160
How about one more time?

1369
04:17:52,160 --> 04:17:53,160
How about one more time?

1370
04:17:53,160 --> 04:17:54,160
How about one more time?

1371
04:17:54,160 --> 04:17:57,160
Wait, eight, seven, six, five, four.

1372
04:18:00,160 --> 04:18:01,160
Oh, it's cool.

1373
04:18:04,160 --> 04:18:06,160
Ten, nine, eight, seven, eight.

1374
04:18:09,160 --> 04:18:10,160
I see diamonds.

1375
04:18:16,160 --> 04:18:18,160
Surely I'll get another diamond.

1376
04:18:18,160 --> 04:18:19,160
No, I won't!

1377
04:18:21,160 --> 04:18:22,160
Shit, I kind of want a diamond.

1378
04:18:24,160 --> 04:18:25,160
Um...

1379
04:18:34,160 --> 04:18:36,160
These are so big, but fuck it, I want a diamond.

1380
04:18:36,160 --> 04:18:37,160
Give me one.

1381
04:18:37,160 --> 04:18:39,160
Yes, one, two, three, four, five.

1382
04:18:39,160 --> 04:18:40,160
Lovely.

1383
04:18:40,160 --> 04:18:43,160
How much we getting?

1384
04:18:43,160 --> 04:18:45,160
We're getting two free jokers out of this as well.

1385
04:18:45,160 --> 04:18:47,160
Double ace, double king.

1386
04:18:47,160 --> 04:18:48,160
Done.

1387
04:18:48,160 --> 04:18:49,160
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

1388
04:18:51,160 --> 04:18:53,160
I'm eating my chicken nipples.

1389
04:18:55,160 --> 04:18:56,160
Well, there you go.

1390
04:18:56,160 --> 04:19:00,160
We are a bit poor, but so is reals cost less.

1391
04:19:02,160 --> 04:19:03,160
Wait!

1392
04:19:04,160 --> 04:19:06,160
Oh, no!

1393
04:19:10,160 --> 04:19:11,160
Oh, no.

1394
04:19:11,160 --> 04:19:14,160
It overrids the other one we could have got.

1395
04:19:16,160 --> 04:19:19,160
I want to reset the run.

1396
04:19:20,160 --> 04:19:21,160
I'm going to reset.

1397
04:19:21,160 --> 04:19:23,160
I didn't know I did that in your run.

1398
04:19:23,160 --> 04:19:24,160
Yeah.

1399
04:19:25,160 --> 04:19:27,160
I didn't realise it did that.

1400
04:19:28,160 --> 04:19:29,160
Okay.

1401
04:19:30,160 --> 04:19:32,160
One joker slot minus a hand.

1402
04:19:32,160 --> 04:19:33,160
Oh, okay.

1403
04:19:34,160 --> 04:19:36,160
We didn't even do anything though.

1404
04:19:36,160 --> 04:19:38,160
We didn't even achieve anything.

1405
04:19:38,160 --> 04:19:39,160
Right.

1406
04:19:39,160 --> 04:19:41,160
If I skip this one,

1407
04:19:43,160 --> 04:19:45,160
and then go into this one.

1408
04:19:45,160 --> 04:19:46,160
Yes.

1409
04:19:46,160 --> 04:19:47,160
Jeez.

1410
04:19:47,160 --> 04:19:49,160
Sorry, I'm a bit slow.

1411
04:19:49,160 --> 04:19:50,160
Right.

1412
04:19:50,160 --> 04:19:53,160
We can actually do a wee baby straight right here.

1413
04:19:53,160 --> 04:19:54,160
Why not?

1414
04:20:01,160 --> 04:20:02,160
Oh, my God.

1415
04:20:02,160 --> 04:20:03,160
This is delicious.

1416
04:20:03,160 --> 04:20:05,160
Wait, I'll just go around.

1417
04:20:06,160 --> 04:20:10,160
It's very hard to lose at this stage.

1418
04:20:13,160 --> 04:20:15,160
I'll go with duple b.

1419
04:20:15,160 --> 04:20:16,160
Okay.

1420
04:20:18,160 --> 04:20:21,160
I think we're going to have to get rid of all this.

1421
04:20:22,160 --> 04:20:23,160
There we go.

1422
04:20:23,160 --> 04:20:25,160
That's what I'm looking for.

1423
04:20:25,160 --> 04:20:27,160
I can't just get rid of that.

1424
04:20:27,160 --> 04:20:28,160
Okay.

1425
04:20:28,160 --> 04:20:30,160
I'm confident in the lower rounds because I'm like,

1426
04:20:30,160 --> 04:20:32,160
it's hard to lose in the lower rounds

1427
04:20:32,160 --> 04:20:35,160
unless you have like devious luck.

1428
04:20:36,160 --> 04:20:37,160
Oh.

1429
04:20:42,160 --> 04:20:43,160
No, sorry.

1430
04:20:43,160 --> 04:20:44,160
The voucher is worth it.

1431
04:20:44,160 --> 04:20:46,160
One extra hand size.

1432
04:20:47,160 --> 04:20:48,160
Yeah.

1433
04:20:48,160 --> 04:20:49,160
Worth.

1434
04:20:49,160 --> 04:20:50,160
I'm keeping it.

1435
04:20:50,160 --> 04:20:51,160
It's mine.

1436
04:20:51,160 --> 04:20:52,160
Next round.

1437
04:20:52,160 --> 04:20:53,160
Let's go.

1438
04:20:54,160 --> 04:20:55,160
Oh.

1439
04:20:56,160 --> 04:20:58,160
The blind was actually reducing it.

1440
04:20:58,160 --> 04:21:00,160
So I've just made it neutral now.

1441
04:21:00,160 --> 04:21:02,160
Oh, my free joker.

1442
04:21:05,160 --> 04:21:07,160
Why am I like this?

1443
04:21:08,160 --> 04:21:10,160
Why was I born this way?

1444
04:21:11,160 --> 04:21:15,160
Why can I only retain one piece of information at a time?

1445
04:21:16,160 --> 04:21:17,160
Why?

1446
04:21:17,160 --> 04:21:20,160
The average human can retain like seven pieces of information

1447
04:21:20,160 --> 04:21:21,160
at any moment.

1448
04:21:21,160 --> 04:21:22,160
Me?

1449
04:21:22,160 --> 04:21:23,160
One.

1450
04:21:24,160 --> 04:21:26,160
That restart.

1451
04:21:26,160 --> 04:21:27,160
Unironically.

1452
04:21:27,160 --> 04:21:28,160
Right.

1453
04:21:28,160 --> 04:21:29,160
Fuck it.

1454
04:21:29,160 --> 04:21:30,160
We're restarting.

1455
04:21:30,160 --> 04:21:31,160
I want to win.

1456
04:21:31,160 --> 04:21:32,160
I want to win.

1457
04:21:32,160 --> 04:21:33,160
Let me reset.

1458
04:21:33,160 --> 04:21:34,160
Let's try it again.

1459
04:21:34,160 --> 04:21:35,160
Three rolls the next shot.

1460
04:21:35,160 --> 04:21:36,160
Yeah.

1461
04:21:36,160 --> 04:21:37,160
No, that's fine.

1462
04:21:37,160 --> 04:21:38,160
Let's go.

1463
04:21:39,160 --> 04:21:41,160
We need to play perfectly

1464
04:21:41,160 --> 04:21:43,160
or we might not as well play at all.

1465
04:21:43,160 --> 04:21:45,160
I'm getting rid of all that and just doing trips.

1466
04:21:50,160 --> 04:21:51,160
Oh, wow.

1467
04:21:51,160 --> 04:21:52,160
Full house.

1468
04:21:52,160 --> 04:21:53,160
Don't mind if I do.

1469
04:21:53,160 --> 04:21:54,160
Don't mind if I do.

1470
04:21:59,160 --> 04:22:00,160
Okay.

1471
04:22:00,160 --> 04:22:01,160
Good.

1472
04:22:01,160 --> 04:22:02,160
What are you doing?

1473
04:22:05,160 --> 04:22:06,160
Mm-hmm.

1474
04:22:06,160 --> 04:22:07,160
Mm-hmm.

1475
04:22:07,160 --> 04:22:08,160
Mm-hmm.

1476
04:22:10,160 --> 04:22:11,160
I'll take you.

1477
04:22:13,160 --> 04:22:15,160
That looks good to me.

1478
04:22:15,160 --> 04:22:16,160
That looks good to you.

1479
04:22:16,160 --> 04:22:17,160
Cuttlefish memory.

1480
04:22:17,160 --> 04:22:18,160
Goldfish memory.

1481
04:22:18,160 --> 04:22:19,160
Oh, I'm way worse.

1482
04:22:19,160 --> 04:22:20,160
Seriously.

1483
04:22:21,160 --> 04:22:22,160
Mm.

1484
04:22:24,160 --> 04:22:27,160
Something else must be your other sex.

1485
04:22:27,160 --> 04:22:29,160
I just think of refluence for the rest.

1486
04:22:29,160 --> 04:22:30,160
Right.

1487
04:22:30,160 --> 04:22:31,160
I'm happy with that.

1488
04:22:31,160 --> 04:22:32,160
I'm going to plan it up,

1489
04:22:32,160 --> 04:22:34,160
which will help me in later game stuff.

1490
04:22:35,160 --> 04:22:36,160
Redeem.

1491
04:22:36,160 --> 04:22:37,160
Okay, good.

1492
04:22:38,160 --> 04:22:40,160
Okay, I think I'm going to kick in again.

1493
04:22:41,160 --> 04:22:42,160
This is delicious.

1494
04:22:44,160 --> 04:22:45,160
Mm-hmm.

1495
04:22:47,160 --> 04:22:48,160
Mm-hmm.

1496
04:22:51,160 --> 04:22:52,160
Mm-hmm.

1497
04:22:54,160 --> 04:22:57,160
That won't get access to the shop until after all of this.

1498
04:22:58,160 --> 04:23:00,160
But it's a free joker.

1499
04:23:01,160 --> 04:23:04,160
Surely I won't forget about the joker.

1500
04:23:04,160 --> 04:23:07,160
Surely I won't forget about the joker.

1501
04:23:07,160 --> 04:23:10,160
All hearts are debuffed.

1502
04:23:10,160 --> 04:23:11,160
That's a lot of hearts.

1503
04:23:11,160 --> 04:23:12,160
I'm not going to lie.

1504
04:23:12,160 --> 04:23:13,160
If I had a king,

1505
04:23:13,160 --> 04:23:15,160
we actually could have done a straight flush there.

1506
04:23:16,160 --> 04:23:17,160
Mm-hmm.

1507
04:23:17,160 --> 04:23:20,160
Get rid of all of you.

1508
04:23:21,160 --> 04:23:23,160
I have three discards, which is fine.

1509
04:23:25,160 --> 04:23:26,160
Um...

1510
04:23:27,160 --> 04:23:28,160
Full house?

1511
04:23:29,160 --> 04:23:30,160
Full house.

1512
04:23:30,160 --> 04:23:31,160
Yes, full house.

1513
04:23:34,160 --> 04:23:35,160
Right.

1514
04:23:35,160 --> 04:23:36,160
Uh, doubles?

1515
04:23:37,160 --> 04:23:38,160
I'll take it.

1516
04:23:38,160 --> 04:23:39,160
I'll throw away this eight,

1517
04:23:39,160 --> 04:23:40,160
because I can't do anything with it.

1518
04:23:40,160 --> 04:23:41,160
Oh, I'm going to see...

1519
04:23:44,160 --> 04:23:45,160
Sorry.

1520
04:23:45,160 --> 04:23:46,160
Ugh.

1521
04:23:47,160 --> 04:23:48,160
Um...

1522
04:23:48,160 --> 04:23:49,160
We'll get rid of the two,

1523
04:23:49,160 --> 04:23:51,160
because it doesn't do anything for me.

1524
04:23:51,160 --> 04:23:52,160
But it's here.

1525
04:23:52,160 --> 04:23:54,160
Thank you very much, we fling.

1526
04:23:54,160 --> 04:23:55,160
Um...

1527
04:23:55,160 --> 04:23:56,160
Well, we have 400.

1528
04:23:56,160 --> 04:23:58,160
We've still got enough free runs.

1529
04:23:58,160 --> 04:23:59,160
I am...

1530
04:24:00,160 --> 04:24:03,160
Let's just clear this deck up a bit.

1531
04:24:03,160 --> 04:24:04,160
I'm not really wanting that.

1532
04:24:04,160 --> 04:24:05,160
Two joker.

1533
04:24:06,160 --> 04:24:07,160
Let's do...

1534
04:24:07,160 --> 04:24:08,160
Oh, two...

1535
04:24:08,160 --> 04:24:09,160
Oh, well.

1536
04:24:09,160 --> 04:24:11,160
That doesn't count, so it's not actually debuffed.

1537
04:24:13,160 --> 04:24:14,160
Bless you.

1538
04:24:14,160 --> 04:24:15,160
He's on high.

1539
04:24:15,160 --> 04:24:16,160
Salute.

1540
04:24:17,160 --> 04:24:18,160
Wait, you're still here?

1541
04:24:18,160 --> 04:24:19,160
Look.

1542
04:24:19,160 --> 04:24:20,160
I'm sorry.

1543
04:24:21,160 --> 04:24:22,160
I'm sorry.

1544
04:24:23,160 --> 04:24:25,160
We're redirecting into Ezra.

1545
04:24:25,160 --> 04:24:27,160
I know it was supposed to be a small stream day.

1546
04:24:27,160 --> 04:24:28,160
I'm addicted.

1547
04:24:28,160 --> 04:24:29,160
Okay, I admit it.

1548
04:24:29,160 --> 04:24:30,160
I have a problem.

1549
04:24:30,160 --> 04:24:32,160
Stage one is admitting you have a problem.

1550
04:24:32,160 --> 04:24:35,160
Does it mean you actually have to fix the problem instantly?

1551
04:24:35,160 --> 04:24:37,160
No, it does not mean that.

1552
04:24:37,160 --> 04:24:38,160
What are you?

1553
04:24:38,160 --> 04:24:39,160
Please.

1554
04:24:39,160 --> 04:24:40,160
Right.

1555
04:24:40,160 --> 04:24:42,160
Retrigger each played.

1556
04:24:42,160 --> 04:24:44,160
Yoink for free.

1557
04:24:44,160 --> 04:24:45,160
What are you?

1558
04:24:45,160 --> 04:24:46,160
Permanently gain a hand each round.

1559
04:24:48,160 --> 04:24:49,160
Mmm.

1560
04:24:51,160 --> 04:24:53,160
But my pair...

1561
04:24:54,160 --> 04:24:56,160
Multiplier is also a hollow.

1562
04:24:56,160 --> 04:24:57,160
Get in my belly.

1563
04:24:57,160 --> 04:24:58,160
Right now.

1564
04:24:58,160 --> 04:24:59,160
Let's go.

1565
04:24:59,160 --> 04:25:00,160
I'll see if I can get this.

1566
04:25:00,160 --> 04:25:02,160
That would be good to get the pick up.

1567
04:25:02,160 --> 04:25:03,160
One extra thingy.

1568
04:25:07,160 --> 04:25:08,160
It would be free.

1569
04:25:09,160 --> 04:25:11,160
It would be free and we have no economy.

1570
04:25:12,160 --> 04:25:15,160
It would be free, but we'd have no economy.

1571
04:25:17,160 --> 04:25:18,160
It's holographic.

1572
04:25:18,160 --> 04:25:21,160
Next based edition Joker is free and comes holographic.

1573
04:25:21,160 --> 04:25:22,160
It's free and comes holographic.

1574
04:25:22,160 --> 04:25:25,160
Are you addicted to Boutro or Strewn?

1575
04:25:25,160 --> 04:25:27,160
What if I said both?

1576
04:25:28,160 --> 04:25:29,160
Did you get the free Joker?

1577
04:25:29,160 --> 04:25:30,160
I did.

1578
04:25:30,160 --> 04:25:33,160
The free Joker is retriggered each played lower card.

1579
04:25:33,160 --> 04:25:35,160
And it's called hack.

1580
04:25:35,160 --> 04:25:36,160
What an interesting name.

1581
04:25:36,160 --> 04:25:40,160
And then I have Sly Joker, which is a holographic.

1582
04:25:40,160 --> 04:25:42,160
So he has 10 multi on pairs.

1583
04:25:42,160 --> 04:25:44,160
So I think we're already doing the pairs.

1584
04:25:46,160 --> 04:25:49,160
We went from gambling bad to gambling addiction in three days.

1585
04:25:49,160 --> 04:25:50,160
It's so jover.

1586
04:25:50,160 --> 04:25:51,160
It's so jover.

1587
04:25:58,160 --> 04:26:03,160
The reward is $3 plus or a holographic for free.

1588
04:26:06,160 --> 04:26:08,160
Our economy is so low.

1589
04:26:10,160 --> 04:26:12,160
I'm needing to build the economy, I think.

1590
04:26:13,160 --> 04:26:15,160
By the way, hollow is flat multi, not tied to a pair.

1591
04:26:18,160 --> 04:26:19,160
All right then.

1592
04:26:20,160 --> 04:26:21,160
All right, you've sold me.

1593
04:26:21,160 --> 04:26:22,160
You've sold me.

1594
04:26:22,160 --> 04:26:23,160
All right.

1595
04:26:23,160 --> 04:26:25,160
Oh, how much?

1596
04:26:25,160 --> 04:26:27,160
Wait, why is it so big?

1597
04:26:35,160 --> 04:26:36,160
I need a 10.

1598
04:26:37,160 --> 04:26:39,160
Let's get rid of all of you then.

1599
04:26:40,160 --> 04:26:41,160
Wait, what do you do?

1600
04:26:41,160 --> 04:26:43,160
If I play a pair, right.

1601
04:26:43,160 --> 04:26:44,160
What happens if I play a pair?

1602
04:26:44,160 --> 04:26:46,160
This is just a test to see what happens when I play a pair.

1603
04:26:46,160 --> 04:26:48,160
I'll also play these to get rid of them.

1604
04:26:48,160 --> 04:26:49,160
What happens if I do a pair?

1605
04:26:49,160 --> 04:26:50,160
What do you do?

1606
04:26:51,160 --> 04:26:52,160
Shit.

1607
04:26:52,160 --> 04:26:53,160
Oh, wait.

1608
04:26:53,160 --> 04:26:54,160
No, you do fantastic.

1609
04:26:54,160 --> 04:26:55,160
Do that again.

1610
04:26:55,160 --> 04:26:56,160
Do it again.

1611
04:26:56,160 --> 04:26:57,160
Right now.

1612
04:26:57,160 --> 04:26:58,160
Right in front of me.

1613
04:26:58,160 --> 04:26:59,160
Oh, that's what I'd like to see.

1614
04:26:59,160 --> 04:27:00,160
Okay.

1615
04:27:00,160 --> 04:27:01,160
Okay.

1616
04:27:01,160 --> 04:27:02,160
Okay.

1617
04:27:02,160 --> 04:27:03,160
That's what I'd like to see.

1618
04:27:03,160 --> 04:27:04,160
I had to make sure.

1619
04:27:04,160 --> 04:27:05,160
I wasn't sure.

1620
04:27:05,160 --> 04:27:06,160
Okay.

1621
04:27:06,160 --> 04:27:07,160
I wasn't sure.

1622
04:27:07,160 --> 04:27:08,160
Right.

1623
04:27:08,160 --> 04:27:09,160
We made $7.

1624
04:27:09,160 --> 04:27:17,160
We need one more dollar, one more doll here, and then we can grab this, which is exactly

1625
04:27:17,160 --> 04:27:18,160
what I want.

1626
04:27:19,160 --> 04:27:20,160
Oh, wait.

1627
04:27:20,160 --> 04:27:21,160
Free Joker.

1628
04:27:21,160 --> 04:27:22,160
Sorry.

1629
04:27:22,160 --> 04:27:23,160
Sorry, free Joker.

1630
04:27:23,160 --> 04:27:24,160
15 multi, one in six chance.

1631
04:27:24,160 --> 04:27:25,160
It gets destroyed though.

1632
04:27:25,160 --> 04:27:26,160
I mean, it was free.

1633
04:27:26,160 --> 04:27:27,160
So I'm not going to be mad.

1634
04:27:27,160 --> 04:27:28,160
Sorry.

1635
04:27:28,160 --> 04:27:29,160
I am so sorry.

1636
04:27:29,160 --> 04:27:32,160
I literally raise all your blood pressures when I do that.

1637
04:27:32,160 --> 04:27:33,160
I just forget.

1638
04:27:33,160 --> 04:27:34,160
I'm like, oh yeah.

1639
04:27:34,160 --> 04:27:35,160
Yeah.

1640
04:27:35,160 --> 04:27:36,160
Right.

1641
04:27:36,160 --> 04:27:37,160
Oh no.

1642
04:27:37,160 --> 04:27:39,160
We're not going to have access to this because I skipped a freaking round.

1643
04:27:39,160 --> 04:27:40,160
Did I?

1644
04:27:40,160 --> 04:27:41,160
I think so.

1645
04:27:41,160 --> 04:27:43,160
Can I sell you?

1646
04:27:44,160 --> 04:27:49,160
So there's a chance it gets destroyed.

1647
04:27:49,160 --> 04:27:53,160
And I'm like, if there's a chance for it to get destroyed, that's quite high.

1648
04:27:53,160 --> 04:27:59,160
I'm tempted to just sell it and then buy this for an extra round at a chance.

1649
04:27:59,160 --> 04:28:05,160
Because if it's going to destroy itself, wait, you guys are celebrating the card though.

1650
04:28:05,160 --> 04:28:06,160
Oh no.

1651
04:28:06,160 --> 04:28:12,160
Once it breaks, you can get another Joker called keep the banana at specials free.

1652
04:28:12,160 --> 04:28:13,160
Okay.

1653
04:28:13,160 --> 04:28:16,160
I'll keep the banana because I'm not unlocked what the banana does.

1654
04:28:16,160 --> 04:28:17,160
Okay.

1655
04:28:17,160 --> 04:28:20,160
Oh, someone says sell though.

1656
04:28:20,160 --> 04:28:27,160
Someone says sell hack.

1657
04:28:27,160 --> 04:28:28,160
You know what?

1658
04:28:28,160 --> 04:28:29,160
Sell hack.

1659
04:28:29,160 --> 04:28:30,160
And then give me this.

1660
04:28:30,160 --> 04:28:33,160
I want an extra round to increase my odds of success.

1661
04:28:33,160 --> 04:28:35,160
One in seven cards gets thrown face down.

1662
04:28:35,160 --> 04:28:36,160
That's fine.

1663
04:28:36,160 --> 04:28:37,160
I'll survive.

1664
04:28:37,160 --> 04:28:38,160
I'll survive.

1665
04:28:38,160 --> 04:28:39,160
I won't survive.

1666
04:28:39,160 --> 04:28:41,160
What the heck are you?

1667
04:28:41,160 --> 04:28:42,160
I don't know.

1668
04:28:42,160 --> 04:28:43,160
Right.

1669
04:28:43,160 --> 04:28:48,160
We'll get rid of the two.

1670
04:28:48,160 --> 04:28:50,160
And the seven and the ten I get.

1671
04:28:50,160 --> 04:28:52,160
Seven's getting a bit high.

1672
04:28:52,160 --> 04:28:53,160
You know what?

1673
04:28:53,160 --> 04:28:55,160
I'll just get rid of these playhounds now.

1674
04:28:55,160 --> 04:28:57,160
I was four.

1675
04:28:57,160 --> 04:28:58,160
Curious.

1676
04:28:58,160 --> 04:28:59,160
Whoa.

1677
04:28:59,160 --> 04:29:02,160
The molly went off.

1678
04:29:02,160 --> 04:29:04,160
The molly went off.

1679
04:29:04,160 --> 04:29:07,160
Don't mind if I do.

1680
04:29:07,160 --> 04:29:08,160
Right.

1681
04:29:08,160 --> 04:29:09,160
What are you?

1682
04:29:10,160 --> 04:29:11,160
Right.

1683
04:29:11,160 --> 04:29:13,160
Just to ask.

1684
04:29:13,160 --> 04:29:14,160
Okay.

1685
04:29:14,160 --> 04:29:15,160
Just to ask.

1686
04:29:15,160 --> 04:29:17,160
What do you do?

1687
04:29:17,160 --> 04:29:19,160
Minus the ante though.

1688
04:29:19,160 --> 04:29:22,160
What?

1689
04:29:22,160 --> 04:29:26,160
I'm tempted in the ante rewind because we unlocked the hand.

1690
04:29:26,160 --> 04:29:30,160
So we would be back to what the usual is but one less in difficulty.

1691
04:29:30,160 --> 04:29:31,160
I am tempted.

1692
04:29:31,160 --> 04:29:32,160
I'll be honest.

1693
04:29:32,160 --> 04:29:34,160
Sly Joker.

1694
04:29:34,160 --> 04:29:38,160
Does Sly Joker compliment three of a kind Joker?

1695
04:29:38,160 --> 04:29:39,160
Wait.

1696
04:29:39,160 --> 04:29:40,160
Three of a kind.

1697
04:29:40,160 --> 04:29:41,160
Yeah.

1698
04:29:41,160 --> 04:29:42,160
Three of a kind.

1699
04:29:42,160 --> 04:29:43,160
Sombra Apoc.

1700
04:29:43,160 --> 04:29:45,160
Thank you for coming to member.

1701
04:29:45,160 --> 04:29:46,160
I appreciate it.

1702
04:29:46,160 --> 04:29:49,160
I'm sorry to all members who are waiting on the membership ASMR.

1703
04:29:49,160 --> 04:29:51,160
I'm a little addicted right now.

1704
04:29:51,160 --> 04:29:52,160
Need to get economy going.

1705
04:29:52,160 --> 04:29:54,160
Oh, you're right.

1706
04:29:54,160 --> 04:30:05,160
But if this is going to reduce the aggro of trying to win, I think we're going to get

1707
04:30:05,160 --> 04:30:10,160
some easy rounds in.

1708
04:30:10,160 --> 04:30:15,160
If it reduces the aggro, I think it's the best.

1709
04:30:15,160 --> 04:30:19,160
It'll give me $9 if I don't play this game.

1710
04:30:19,160 --> 04:30:28,160
So I take it because I can't make $9 in a round right now.

1711
04:30:28,160 --> 04:30:29,160
Worth it.

1712
04:30:29,160 --> 04:30:30,160
Okay.

1713
04:30:30,160 --> 04:30:36,160
Initial cards and booster packs in the next shop are free.

1714
04:30:36,160 --> 04:30:43,160
Initial cards and booster packs are free.

1715
04:30:43,160 --> 04:30:46,160
The booster packs are free.

1716
04:30:46,160 --> 04:30:47,160
Yeah.

1717
04:30:47,160 --> 04:30:49,160
This one too.

1718
04:30:49,160 --> 04:30:50,160
Double skip.

1719
04:30:50,160 --> 04:30:52,160
I need to leave now.

1720
04:30:52,160 --> 04:30:53,160
Rest well.

1721
04:30:53,160 --> 04:30:54,160
Thank you for hanging.

1722
04:30:54,160 --> 04:30:55,160
I appreciate it.

1723
04:30:55,160 --> 04:30:56,160
Sorry for being addicted.

1724
04:30:56,160 --> 04:30:57,160
Worth as well.

1725
04:30:57,160 --> 04:30:58,160
Okay.

1726
04:30:58,160 --> 04:31:01,160
Discard two random cards pair hand plate.

1727
04:31:01,160 --> 04:31:02,160
Oh, no.

1728
04:31:02,160 --> 04:31:03,160
You mean I get to...

1729
04:31:03,160 --> 04:31:04,160
Oh, wait.

1730
04:31:04,160 --> 04:31:08,160
Discard two random cards.

1731
04:31:08,160 --> 04:31:16,160
Well, the best I can do is this.

1732
04:31:16,160 --> 04:31:18,160
Oh, wait.

1733
04:31:18,160 --> 04:31:19,160
In my hand.

1734
04:31:19,160 --> 04:31:21,160
Oh, well, we won.

1735
04:31:21,160 --> 04:31:24,160
Oh, well.

1736
04:31:24,160 --> 04:31:27,160
Thank you, I guess.

1737
04:31:27,160 --> 04:31:29,160
Everything is free.

1738
04:31:29,160 --> 04:31:33,160
Earn two bucks pair discard if no discards are used.

1739
04:31:33,160 --> 04:31:35,160
Thank you.

1740
04:31:35,160 --> 04:31:36,160
Destroy two cards.

1741
04:31:36,160 --> 04:31:39,160
I don't know if I want to destroy cards yet.

1742
04:31:39,160 --> 04:31:41,160
Use two tarot cards.

1743
04:31:41,160 --> 04:31:43,160
Choose between a joker.

1744
04:31:43,160 --> 04:31:45,160
Let's go.

1745
04:31:45,160 --> 04:31:48,160
Each played 10 or four gives 10 chips in a multi.

1746
04:31:48,160 --> 04:31:50,160
Every played card permanently...

1747
04:31:50,160 --> 04:31:51,160
Oh, we've just started.

1748
04:31:51,160 --> 04:31:53,160
So backpack man, you're in.

1749
04:31:53,160 --> 04:31:54,160
We've just started.

1750
04:31:54,160 --> 04:31:57,160
Use two tarot cards immediately.

1751
04:31:57,160 --> 04:31:59,160
We have just started.

1752
04:31:59,160 --> 04:32:00,160
Hydration check.

1753
04:32:00,160 --> 04:32:01,160
Yes, little reeflings.

1754
04:32:01,160 --> 04:32:04,160
Please do hydrate.

1755
04:32:04,160 --> 04:32:06,160
I like the lucky cards.

1756
04:32:06,160 --> 04:32:07,160
Creates a random joker.

1757
04:32:07,160 --> 04:32:08,160
Converts.

1758
04:32:08,160 --> 04:32:09,160
Nope.

1759
04:32:09,160 --> 04:32:10,160
Nope.

1760
04:32:10,160 --> 04:32:11,160
Nope.

1761
04:32:11,160 --> 04:32:12,160
Okay, it's you.

1762
04:32:12,160 --> 04:32:14,160
I think it's you.

1763
04:32:14,160 --> 04:32:16,160
And put it on the kings.

1764
04:32:16,160 --> 04:32:18,160
I think put it on the kings.

1765
04:32:18,160 --> 04:32:23,160
Yeah, two kings locked up on the magician.

1766
04:32:23,160 --> 04:32:25,160
I've got one yes.

1767
04:32:25,160 --> 04:32:27,160
I've got one yes.

1768
04:32:27,160 --> 04:32:29,160
I'm getting my hand held.

1769
04:32:29,160 --> 04:32:30,160
Yeah.

1770
04:32:30,160 --> 04:32:31,160
Sure, why not?

1771
04:32:31,160 --> 04:32:32,160
Okay.

1772
04:32:32,160 --> 04:32:33,160
Good logic then.

1773
04:32:33,160 --> 04:32:34,160
Oh, look at that.

1774
04:32:34,160 --> 04:32:35,160
Old tassie.

1775
04:32:35,160 --> 04:32:36,160
Joker.

1776
04:32:36,160 --> 04:32:38,160
Convert up to three.

1777
04:32:38,160 --> 04:32:39,160
Nope.

1778
04:32:39,160 --> 04:32:40,160
Hot.

1779
04:32:40,160 --> 04:32:41,160
What does this do?

1780
04:32:41,160 --> 04:32:43,160
Converts a random joker card.

1781
04:32:43,160 --> 04:32:44,160
Creates.

1782
04:32:44,160 --> 04:32:46,160
Sorry, not converts.

1783
04:32:46,160 --> 04:32:47,160
Creates.

1784
04:32:47,160 --> 04:32:48,160
I am not going to go like this one.

1785
04:32:48,160 --> 04:32:51,160
This joker gains a multiplier pair consecutive hand played

1786
04:32:51,160 --> 04:32:54,160
without playing your most played poker hand.

1787
04:32:54,160 --> 04:32:56,160
The obelisk.

1788
04:32:56,160 --> 04:32:57,160
Sure.

1789
04:32:57,160 --> 04:33:01,160
If we want to destroy...

1790
04:33:01,160 --> 04:33:07,160
I mean, it's free, so...

1791
04:33:07,160 --> 04:33:09,160
Maybe we'll hold on to it for now

1792
04:33:09,160 --> 04:33:11,160
because I don't know if we're going to try and go

1793
04:33:11,160 --> 04:33:13,160
for certain numbers or whatever.

1794
04:33:13,160 --> 04:33:15,160
That's a hard...

1795
04:33:15,160 --> 04:33:16,160
I hope for a good joker.

1796
04:33:16,160 --> 04:33:17,160
It's kind of hard.

1797
04:33:17,160 --> 04:33:19,160
I mean, it's just going to happen naturally.

1798
04:33:19,160 --> 04:33:23,160
Raise the cap on interest earned.

1799
04:33:23,160 --> 04:33:24,160
Yes.

1800
04:33:24,160 --> 04:33:27,160
This is good for our economy now.

1801
04:33:27,160 --> 04:33:30,160
We're only going to be able to get one extra dollar back,

1802
04:33:30,160 --> 04:33:32,160
but over time, it's going to add up.

1803
04:33:32,160 --> 04:33:34,160
So let's not beat around the bush.

1804
04:33:34,160 --> 04:33:35,160
Gives...

1805
04:33:35,160 --> 04:33:36,160
Nope.

1806
04:33:36,160 --> 04:33:37,160
I don't know what that means.

1807
04:33:37,160 --> 04:33:38,160
So we're not playing it.

1808
04:33:38,160 --> 04:33:39,160
I don't know what it means.

1809
04:33:39,160 --> 04:33:40,160
Ooh!

1810
04:33:40,160 --> 04:33:44,160
We've already got double a vase

1811
04:33:44,160 --> 04:33:47,160
and I'll throw the four away.

1812
04:33:47,160 --> 04:33:54,160
Play hands.

1813
04:33:54,160 --> 04:33:57,160
I don't mind if I do.

1814
04:33:57,160 --> 04:33:59,160
Delayed gratification.

1815
04:33:59,160 --> 04:34:01,160
Six dollars?

1816
04:34:01,160 --> 04:34:03,160
Wait, what's delayed gratification?

1817
04:34:03,160 --> 04:34:06,160
You earn two bucks per discard

1818
04:34:06,160 --> 04:34:08,160
if no discards are used.

1819
04:34:08,160 --> 04:34:13,160
That's not delayed gratification.

1820
04:34:13,160 --> 04:34:15,160
That's faster than I normally finish.

1821
04:34:15,160 --> 04:34:18,160
What are you on about?

1822
04:34:18,160 --> 04:34:21,160
Choose one out of four spectra.

1823
04:34:21,160 --> 04:34:23,160
A bit of a bank card again.

1824
04:34:23,160 --> 04:34:25,160
Is that when I can enhance a card?

1825
04:34:25,160 --> 04:34:26,160
Oh, wow.

1826
04:34:26,160 --> 04:34:27,160
Delayed gratification.

1827
04:34:27,160 --> 04:34:31,160
We'll get you 50 on Mac interest so fast, yeah.

1828
04:34:31,160 --> 04:34:35,160
Playing card to add to your deck.

1829
04:34:35,160 --> 04:34:38,160
We're kind of a straight flush.

1830
04:34:38,160 --> 04:34:41,160
No, I don't even want to waste my money on a straight flush.

1831
04:34:41,160 --> 04:34:43,160
Choose...

1832
04:34:44,160 --> 04:34:46,160
I think I want a max economy.

1833
04:34:46,160 --> 04:34:48,160
Let's do a max economy right away.

1834
04:34:48,160 --> 04:34:50,160
One more round and we'll be good to go.

1835
04:34:50,160 --> 04:34:55,160
I'm needing some joker cards to shape the way I play the game though.

1836
04:34:55,160 --> 04:34:57,160
I think once this gets destroyed we can pick up.

1837
04:34:57,160 --> 04:35:01,160
I have a pair joker card.

1838
04:35:01,160 --> 04:35:04,160
No, let's do a economy please.

1839
04:35:04,160 --> 04:35:08,160
I do 50 chips if played hand contains a pair.

1840
04:35:08,160 --> 04:35:10,160
Two pairs, let's go.

1841
04:35:10,160 --> 04:35:14,160
Get rid of the nine I guess because I've already got a little cheeky pair right here.

1842
04:35:14,160 --> 04:35:18,160
Joker gains for a hand that's not played.

1843
04:35:18,160 --> 04:35:22,160
Hanged man on the twos maybe.

1844
04:35:22,160 --> 04:35:26,160
Just to get them out of the way.

1845
04:35:26,160 --> 04:35:29,160
See, if Fibonacci comes into play...

1846
04:35:29,160 --> 04:35:31,160
Full 18!

1847
04:35:31,160 --> 04:35:34,160
Delayed gratification is nuts.

1848
04:35:34,160 --> 04:35:36,160
Holy crap.

1849
04:35:36,160 --> 04:35:38,160
We do have...

1850
04:35:38,160 --> 04:35:40,160
This is just straight up for multiplayer.

1851
04:35:40,160 --> 04:35:42,160
My banana's gone!

1852
04:35:42,160 --> 04:35:44,160
Who took my banana?

1853
04:35:44,160 --> 04:35:46,160
Give it back right now.

1854
04:35:46,160 --> 04:35:48,160
Give me my banana back.

1855
04:35:48,160 --> 04:35:50,160
Great, we're going to get that because that's fantastic.

1856
04:35:50,160 --> 04:35:52,160
Right multiplayer, do I need to put it in a certain order?

1857
04:35:52,160 --> 04:35:54,160
Maybe after the obelisk?

1858
04:35:54,160 --> 04:35:58,160
You don't want to play your best hand every round to scale obelisk.

1859
04:35:58,160 --> 04:36:00,160
Ooh.

1860
04:36:00,160 --> 04:36:04,160
Okay, maybe we're probably going to swap out obelisk at some point.

1861
04:36:04,160 --> 04:36:06,160
Can I get pairs?

1862
04:36:06,160 --> 04:36:08,160
Pair love, contains a pair.

1863
04:36:08,160 --> 04:36:10,160
Yes, let's level up Mercury.

1864
04:36:10,160 --> 04:36:12,160
Nice and simple, we've already got Mercury getting on the thing.

1865
04:36:12,160 --> 04:36:14,160
Choose one of three playing cards to add to the deck.

1866
04:36:14,160 --> 04:36:18,160
See, I don't have anything that's shaped in a deck right now.

1867
04:36:18,160 --> 04:36:22,160
Creates up to two random tarot cards.

1868
04:36:22,160 --> 04:36:24,160
I mean, we could get the Wheel of Fortune, you know what?

1869
04:36:24,160 --> 04:36:26,160
We could get the Wheel.

1870
04:36:26,160 --> 04:36:28,160
Oh.

1871
04:36:28,160 --> 04:36:32,160
I will sell you, I don't want to use you.

1872
04:36:32,160 --> 04:36:34,160
You destroy up to two selected.

1873
04:36:34,160 --> 04:36:38,160
I need some.

1874
04:36:38,160 --> 04:36:42,160
Maybe just...

1875
04:36:42,160 --> 04:36:44,160
I don't know.

1876
04:36:44,160 --> 04:36:48,160
Well, whatever this does, we can buy it because we have 25.

1877
04:36:48,160 --> 04:36:50,160
Ooh, I want luck.

1878
04:36:50,160 --> 04:36:52,160
Yeah, I want luck, give me lucky.

1879
04:36:52,160 --> 04:36:54,160
Lucky, lucky four.

1880
04:36:54,160 --> 04:36:56,160
Wait, why did you sell what you just bought?

1881
04:36:56,160 --> 04:36:58,160
I'm not going to use it.

1882
04:36:58,160 --> 04:37:00,160
I don't like it.

1883
04:37:00,160 --> 04:37:02,160
I don't like glass cards.

1884
04:37:02,160 --> 04:37:06,160
Um, your interest cap is no 50.

1885
04:37:06,160 --> 04:37:08,160
Scam Emperor's Edge, fair enough.

1886
04:37:08,160 --> 04:37:10,160
Yeah, I don't like the idea of breaking a card.

1887
04:37:10,160 --> 04:37:14,160
Cards played previously, this auntie, or debuff.

1888
04:37:14,160 --> 04:37:18,160
That's fain.

1889
04:37:18,160 --> 04:37:24,160
That's fain, that doesn't hurt me at all.

1890
04:37:24,160 --> 04:37:28,160
Right, I'm just going to play all this to get rid of it.

1891
04:37:28,160 --> 04:37:30,160
I think.

1892
04:37:32,160 --> 04:37:38,160
Okay, what did that do?

1893
04:37:38,160 --> 04:37:42,160
If I get an ace, I have a straight flush.

1894
04:37:42,160 --> 04:37:44,160
So just play all of that.

1895
04:37:44,160 --> 04:37:46,160
I have so many cards I can play.

1896
04:37:46,160 --> 04:37:48,160
I don't like depending on glass though.

1897
04:37:48,160 --> 04:37:50,160
Just translate to half a hind man.

1898
04:37:50,160 --> 04:37:52,160
I make bad cards, glass.

1899
04:37:52,160 --> 04:37:54,160
Yeah, I think I can...

1900
04:37:54,160 --> 04:37:56,160
Oh, I do have a straight, you're right.

1901
04:37:56,160 --> 04:37:58,160
Oh my god, one, two, three, four.

1902
04:37:58,160 --> 04:38:00,160
Just like that.

1903
04:38:00,160 --> 04:38:02,160
I forget this straight doesn't have to be an ace.

1904
04:38:02,160 --> 04:38:04,160
Like a dumb dumb.

1905
04:38:04,160 --> 04:38:06,160
Oh no.

1906
04:38:06,160 --> 04:38:08,160
That banana was working overtime.

1907
04:38:08,160 --> 04:38:10,160
Not going to lie.

1908
04:38:12,160 --> 04:38:16,160
9, 8, 7, 6, 5.

1909
04:38:16,160 --> 04:38:18,160
Or 10 maybe.

1910
04:38:18,160 --> 04:38:20,160
10, 9, 8, 7, 6.

1911
04:38:20,160 --> 04:38:22,160
Is that just going to do it again?

1912
04:38:22,160 --> 04:38:24,160
Is that enough?

1913
04:38:24,160 --> 04:38:26,160
Oh, this isn't looking so good.

1914
04:38:26,160 --> 04:38:28,160
I think I'll be doing ace more quickly than I thought.

1915
04:38:28,160 --> 04:38:30,160
Delayed gratification still gave me...

1916
04:38:30,160 --> 04:38:32,160
What, six dollars?

1917
04:38:32,160 --> 04:38:34,160
But I didn't do it right.

1918
04:38:34,160 --> 04:38:38,160
Earn two dollars per discard if no discards are used by the end of the round.

1919
04:38:38,160 --> 04:38:42,160
Oh, whatever's remaining at times it by two.

1920
04:38:42,160 --> 04:38:44,160
Okay, so three times two is six.

1921
04:38:44,160 --> 04:38:46,160
Okay, okay.

1922
04:38:46,160 --> 04:38:48,160
Big economy, let's go.

1923
04:38:50,160 --> 04:38:52,160
Joker, turret, planet and spectral cards may appear multiple times.

1924
04:38:52,160 --> 04:38:54,160
What's that mean?

1925
04:38:54,160 --> 04:38:56,160
Foil, holographics are more likely.

1926
04:38:56,160 --> 04:38:58,160
But that's just for a chance.

1927
04:38:58,160 --> 04:39:00,160
Oh, we've got two celestials though.

1928
04:39:00,160 --> 04:39:04,160
Hold on, let's do mega, cheeky mega celestials.

1929
04:39:04,160 --> 04:39:08,160
We've got Mercury, straight on Mercury.

1930
04:39:08,160 --> 04:39:10,160
Pairs, let's go. Shout out to all my pairs.

1931
04:39:12,160 --> 04:39:14,160
Three of a kind contains a pair.

1932
04:39:14,160 --> 04:39:20,160
So I am tempted to do three of a kind because it's more likely to occur.

1933
04:39:20,160 --> 04:39:22,160
And then we'll do jumbo.

1934
04:39:22,160 --> 04:39:26,160
Udinus, two pairs.

1935
04:39:26,160 --> 04:39:28,160
Yeah, two pairs.

1936
04:39:28,160 --> 04:39:30,160
Let's try that.

1937
04:39:30,160 --> 04:39:32,160
Let's even out the kind of pairing match up setup.

1938
04:39:34,160 --> 04:39:36,160
Should I do that?

1939
04:39:38,160 --> 04:39:40,160
I don't know, I would put my economy below but...

1940
04:39:42,160 --> 04:39:44,160
But...

1941
04:39:44,160 --> 04:39:48,160
The economy is going very well with delayed gratification.

1942
04:39:48,160 --> 04:39:50,160
Going the all render.

1943
04:39:50,160 --> 04:39:54,160
Showman is tricky but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have lots of money.

1944
04:39:56,160 --> 04:39:58,160
Remember that max economy is 50.

1945
04:39:58,160 --> 04:40:00,160
Oh, it stays 50?

1946
04:40:02,160 --> 04:40:04,160
So I'm burning through my max economy.

1947
04:40:12,160 --> 04:40:16,160
Delayed gratifications giving us like 50 bucks around.

1948
04:40:20,160 --> 04:40:36,160
I know I shouldn't be greedy but can create two common jokers.

1949
04:40:36,160 --> 04:40:38,160
I don't even have room.

1950
04:40:38,160 --> 04:40:40,160
I don't even have room.

1951
04:40:40,160 --> 04:40:42,160
You can be a little greedy.

1952
04:40:44,160 --> 04:40:48,160
We've got a triple and nothing else actually.

1953
04:40:50,160 --> 04:40:52,160
Just use these up.

1954
04:40:52,160 --> 04:40:54,160
Let's see if we can get our double four.

1955
04:40:56,160 --> 04:40:58,160
Don't forget to hydrate.

1956
04:41:02,160 --> 04:41:04,160
98765.

1957
04:41:06,160 --> 04:41:08,160
Just like that.

1958
04:41:08,160 --> 04:41:10,160
All done.

1959
04:41:12,160 --> 04:41:14,160
Good luck on the straight.

1960
04:41:16,160 --> 04:41:18,160
Cash out to 15.

1961
04:41:18,160 --> 04:41:20,160
Getting this game was a mistake.

1962
04:41:20,160 --> 04:41:22,160
I'm fucking addicted.

1963
04:41:22,160 --> 04:41:24,160
Celestial pack jumbo.

1964
04:41:28,160 --> 04:41:30,160
Oh, I love streamer luck.

1965
04:41:30,160 --> 04:41:34,160
It's real and unfathomable with a base.

1966
04:41:36,160 --> 04:41:38,160
What joker was that?

1967
04:41:38,160 --> 04:41:40,160
Sorry, I keep burning through.

1968
04:41:40,160 --> 04:41:42,160
One discard each round.

1969
04:41:42,160 --> 04:41:44,160
Wait, are you...

1970
04:41:44,160 --> 04:41:46,160
You thing you play into this one?

1971
04:41:46,160 --> 04:41:48,160
I'm wondering if I should get rid of the obelisk.

1972
04:41:50,160 --> 04:41:58,160
I technically am going to make $2 extra every time this guy is hanging out with the obelisk.

1973
04:41:58,160 --> 04:42:00,160
You still have a slot?

1974
04:42:00,160 --> 04:42:02,160
What did you call me?

1975
04:42:02,160 --> 04:42:04,160
What did you call me, Riffin?

1976
04:42:04,160 --> 04:42:06,160
Tarot card. Choose one tarot card.

1977
04:42:06,160 --> 04:42:08,160
No, let's...

1978
04:42:08,160 --> 04:42:10,160
Hold on to some economy.

1979
04:42:10,160 --> 04:42:12,160
It gives us a spectral function.

1980
04:42:12,160 --> 04:42:14,160
I...

1981
04:42:14,160 --> 04:42:16,160
Exactly, that's what I thought.

1982
04:42:16,160 --> 04:42:18,160
$2 double Vs.

1983
04:42:26,160 --> 04:42:28,160
Five chips every time.

1984
04:42:28,160 --> 04:42:30,160
It's plead. And the same round.

1985
04:42:32,160 --> 04:42:34,160
Forever.

1986
04:42:34,160 --> 04:42:36,160
Oh yeah, yeah, upgrade.

1987
04:42:36,160 --> 04:42:38,160
Oh wow, okay, holy crap.

1988
04:42:38,160 --> 04:42:40,160
I'm starting to...

1989
04:42:40,160 --> 04:42:42,160
Get it. Mildly.

1990
04:42:42,160 --> 04:42:44,160
I'm starting to get it.

1991
04:42:44,160 --> 04:42:46,160
I want to upgrade all my...

1992
04:42:46,160 --> 04:42:48,160
Everything then, I guess.

1993
04:42:48,160 --> 04:42:50,160
Oh wait, the four didn't count.

1994
04:42:50,160 --> 04:42:52,160
Sorry, I'm not paying attention.

1995
04:42:52,160 --> 04:42:54,160
I'm just having fun putting it together.

1996
04:42:54,160 --> 04:42:56,160
I think they've got me. I'm sorry.

1997
04:42:56,160 --> 04:42:58,160
I think I've been hook, lain, and sinkered.

1998
04:42:58,160 --> 04:43:00,160
Hook, lain, and sink...

1999
04:43:00,160 --> 04:43:02,160
What? Hook, lain, and sinker!

2000
04:43:02,160 --> 04:43:04,160
There.

2001
04:43:04,160 --> 04:43:06,160
Okay, there we go.

2002
04:43:06,160 --> 04:43:08,160
I'm not like paying attention because we don't have to sweat just yet.

2003
04:43:08,160 --> 04:43:10,160
But when we have to start sweating,

2004
04:43:10,160 --> 04:43:12,160
don't think I won't be looking at you as reference

2005
04:43:12,160 --> 04:43:14,160
for advice, because I don't know what I'm doing.

2006
04:43:14,160 --> 04:43:16,160
Delayed gratification gave us...

2007
04:43:16,160 --> 04:43:18,160
Fuah. See? We've already made it back.

2008
04:43:22,160 --> 04:43:24,160
Played cards with clubs gives a molly.

2009
04:43:24,160 --> 04:43:26,160
One molly per tarot card used.

2010
04:43:26,160 --> 04:43:28,160
This run?

2011
04:43:28,160 --> 04:43:30,160
Wait!

2012
04:43:32,160 --> 04:43:34,160
I'ma start flying left and right with tarot cards.

2013
04:43:34,160 --> 04:43:36,160
If that... If I comprehend this correctly...

2014
04:43:40,160 --> 04:43:42,160
If I comprehend this correctly,

2015
04:43:42,160 --> 04:43:44,160
throw that out

2016
04:43:44,160 --> 04:43:46,160
and then put that in

2017
04:43:46,160 --> 04:43:48,160
and then go nuts buying stuff.

2018
04:43:48,160 --> 04:43:50,160
Sell your red joker?

2019
04:43:50,160 --> 04:43:52,160
This guy?

2020
04:43:52,160 --> 04:43:54,160
I think sell the obelisk

2021
04:43:54,160 --> 04:43:56,160
because I'm only going to want to do pairs.

2022
04:43:58,160 --> 04:44:00,160
Yeah, I want to sell the obelisk.

2023
04:44:00,160 --> 04:44:02,160
It works. I'm using it right now.

2024
04:44:02,160 --> 04:44:04,160
Are you playing? Are you playing?

2025
04:44:04,160 --> 04:44:06,160
At the same time as me?

2026
04:44:06,160 --> 04:44:08,160
You're supposed to give me advice!

2027
04:44:08,160 --> 04:44:10,160
You're supposed to tell me how to win.

2028
04:44:10,160 --> 04:44:12,160
You've got to play it on your own.

2029
04:44:12,160 --> 04:44:14,160
Right, sell the obelisk because the obelisk

2030
04:44:14,160 --> 04:44:16,160
is going to start getting a bit useless.

2031
04:44:18,160 --> 04:44:20,160
Tarot card buy.

2032
04:44:20,160 --> 04:44:22,160
So you'll multiply.

2033
04:44:22,160 --> 04:44:24,160
I'm going to start dropping tarot cards

2034
04:44:24,160 --> 04:44:26,160
left and right. That's all I'm saying.

2035
04:44:26,160 --> 04:44:28,160
Celestial pack? Let's go.

2036
04:44:28,160 --> 04:44:30,160
Oh!

2037
04:44:30,160 --> 04:44:32,160
Mercury.

2038
04:44:32,160 --> 04:44:34,160
Oh, we love to see it mercury.

2039
04:44:34,160 --> 04:44:36,160
We do. And then use two

2040
04:44:36,160 --> 04:44:38,160
two Tarots. Right, let's go.

2041
04:44:38,160 --> 04:44:40,160
The Wheel of Fortune.

2042
04:44:40,160 --> 04:44:42,160
Oh, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

2043
04:44:42,160 --> 04:44:44,160
Don't get... Hold on. Hold on. Pause. Pause. Pause.

2044
04:44:44,160 --> 04:44:46,160
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

2045
04:44:46,160 --> 04:44:48,160
I still need to read because I don't know what to do.

2046
04:44:48,160 --> 04:44:50,160
Left card comes to right.

2047
04:44:50,160 --> 04:44:52,160
Create two planetary cards.

2048
04:44:52,160 --> 04:44:54,160
Curious. Create the last Tarot card.

2049
04:44:54,160 --> 04:44:56,160
Oop!

2050
04:44:58,160 --> 04:45:00,160
Create the last Tarot card or Planet card

2051
04:45:00,160 --> 04:45:02,160
used during this run.

2052
04:45:02,160 --> 04:45:04,160
The full is excluded. Mercury.

2053
04:45:04,160 --> 04:45:06,160
I can level up pairs again with a full.

2054
04:45:10,160 --> 04:45:12,160
Use the full.

2055
04:45:12,160 --> 04:45:14,160
We're using the full.

2056
04:45:14,160 --> 04:45:16,160
We're going to use that now.

2057
04:45:16,160 --> 04:45:18,160
We're also going to delete some cards.

2058
04:45:18,160 --> 04:45:20,160
No, we're not. We have to use it in-game apparently.

2059
04:45:20,160 --> 04:45:22,160
Rude. And then it's my little guy.

2060
04:45:22,160 --> 04:45:24,160
Oh my god, he's up at four!

2061
04:45:24,160 --> 04:45:26,160
Right. And then imagine

2062
04:45:26,160 --> 04:45:28,160
he gets hit with the Wheel of Fortune though.

2063
04:45:32,160 --> 04:45:34,160
It's hard to use the Wheel.

2064
04:45:34,160 --> 04:45:36,160
You can use the Hanged Mana.

2065
04:45:36,160 --> 04:45:38,160
I just need to select.

2066
04:45:38,160 --> 04:45:40,160
Oh, my apologies. Okay.

2067
04:45:40,160 --> 04:45:42,160
Let's just get rid of the lower ones then.

2068
04:45:44,160 --> 04:45:46,160
Okay. Do we get rid of the lower ones?

2069
04:45:46,160 --> 04:45:48,160
Right. Hydration. Sorry.

2070
04:45:48,160 --> 04:45:50,160
My tea's getting cold again.

2071
04:45:52,160 --> 04:45:54,160
I cannae stream and drink tea at the same time.

2072
04:45:54,160 --> 04:45:56,160
All the cheese, honestly.

2073
04:45:58,160 --> 04:46:00,160
My Apocrates.

2074
04:46:00,160 --> 04:46:02,160
Yeah, I don't have anything that is telling me

2075
04:46:02,160 --> 04:46:04,160
unless the Fibonacci comes up

2076
04:46:04,160 --> 04:46:06,160
instantly after this.

2077
04:46:06,160 --> 04:46:08,160
Then four and six.

2078
04:46:08,160 --> 04:46:10,160
I mean, we could bet the Fibonacci shows up.

2079
04:46:10,160 --> 04:46:12,160
If we do four and six then...

2080
04:46:12,160 --> 04:46:14,160
Yeah.

2081
04:46:18,160 --> 04:46:20,160
Fuck it. We're going to see.

2082
04:46:20,160 --> 04:46:22,160
He's up at five now.

2083
04:46:22,160 --> 04:46:24,160
Multi-Cards.

2084
04:46:24,160 --> 04:46:26,160
Planet.

2085
04:46:26,160 --> 04:46:28,160
Possibly.

2086
04:46:28,160 --> 04:46:30,160
Planet Earth.

2087
04:46:30,160 --> 04:46:32,160
Risk it.

2088
04:46:32,160 --> 04:46:34,160
I ain't risk it.

2089
04:46:34,160 --> 04:46:36,160
No!

2090
04:46:36,160 --> 04:46:38,160
But it went up though.

2091
04:46:38,160 --> 04:46:40,160
It went up though. That's all I care about.

2092
04:46:40,160 --> 04:46:42,160
Money go up. First hand is drawn face down.

2093
04:46:44,160 --> 04:46:46,160
Thanks, I guess.

2094
04:46:48,160 --> 04:46:50,160
We have five turns. Four discards.

2095
04:46:52,160 --> 04:46:54,160
Hear me out.

2096
04:46:54,160 --> 04:46:56,160
Just go for it.

2097
04:46:58,160 --> 04:47:00,160
Yeah.

2098
04:47:00,160 --> 04:47:02,160
Just go for it.

2099
04:47:04,160 --> 04:47:06,160
Yeah. Okay.

2100
04:47:06,160 --> 04:47:08,160
We got a double ten!

2101
04:47:10,160 --> 04:47:12,160
We got four thousand for that little cheeky move there.

2102
04:47:12,160 --> 04:47:14,160
We'll do the eights and then we'll

2103
04:47:14,160 --> 04:47:16,160
unflip all of these guys as well.

2104
04:47:16,160 --> 04:47:18,160
I know it's not going to be a thing

2105
04:47:18,160 --> 04:47:20,160
but we'll unflip them.

2106
04:47:22,160 --> 04:47:24,160
Beautiful. Stunning.

2107
04:47:24,160 --> 04:47:26,160
Gorgeous.

2108
04:47:26,160 --> 04:47:28,160
You just love this game.

2109
04:47:28,160 --> 04:47:30,160
It goes there. Identify yourself.

2110
04:47:30,160 --> 04:47:32,160
We're actually going to have to do a discard

2111
04:47:32,160 --> 04:47:34,160
because there's nothing we can do.

2112
04:47:34,160 --> 04:47:36,160
That's actually really rare.

2113
04:47:36,160 --> 04:47:38,160
Normally we can always do something every round.

2114
04:47:40,160 --> 04:47:42,160
One, two, three, four, five.

2115
04:47:42,160 --> 04:47:44,160
I know I should keep that but we're literally a thousand off

2116
04:47:44,160 --> 04:47:46,160
so just do a discard.

2117
04:47:46,160 --> 04:47:48,160
If I play it, I get to keep a dollar.

2118
04:47:48,160 --> 04:47:50,160
I get to keep two dollars

2119
04:47:50,160 --> 04:47:52,160
if I don't use the discard

2120
04:47:52,160 --> 04:47:54,160
so I'm just going to play nothing.

2121
04:47:56,160 --> 04:47:58,160
Lucky can give you cash.

2122
04:47:58,160 --> 04:48:00,160
So we're just going to play nothing

2123
04:48:00,160 --> 04:48:02,160
and do a high card or whatever you call it.

2124
04:48:02,160 --> 04:48:04,160
Alright, there we go.

2125
04:48:04,160 --> 04:48:06,160
We got troops.

2126
04:48:06,160 --> 04:48:08,160
Well, then that's it.

2127
04:48:08,160 --> 04:48:10,160
Okay.

2128
04:48:12,160 --> 04:48:14,160
Yay!

2129
04:48:16,160 --> 04:48:18,160
I'll try to finish my tea.

2130
04:48:18,160 --> 04:48:20,160
There we go. 18 for that one round.

2131
04:48:20,160 --> 04:48:22,160
Fantastic.

2132
04:48:22,160 --> 04:48:24,160
Reroll boss blind one time per anti.

2133
04:48:24,160 --> 04:48:26,160
10 bucks though

2134
04:48:26,160 --> 04:48:28,160
to do that.

2135
04:48:28,160 --> 04:48:30,160
If we get a really...

2136
04:48:30,160 --> 04:48:32,160
Choose one of four joker cards.

2137
04:48:32,160 --> 04:48:34,160
No!

2138
04:48:34,160 --> 04:48:36,160
Of course when I pick up tarot cards

2139
04:48:36,160 --> 04:48:38,160
it doesn't give me tarot cards.

2140
04:48:40,160 --> 04:48:42,160
Use run info to check the boss blind.

2141
04:48:42,160 --> 04:48:44,160
Run info?

2142
04:48:44,160 --> 04:48:46,160
Blinds. Wait, can I see what's up ahead?

2143
04:48:48,160 --> 04:48:50,160
Play only one type.

2144
04:48:50,160 --> 04:48:52,160
This is upcoming.

2145
04:48:52,160 --> 04:48:54,160
What's vouchers?

2146
04:48:54,160 --> 04:48:56,160
Oh, this is what I have.

2147
04:48:56,160 --> 04:48:58,160
Vouchers redeem this run.

2148
04:48:58,160 --> 04:49:00,160
Okay.

2149
04:49:00,160 --> 04:49:02,160
I completely forgot I got all these.

2150
04:49:02,160 --> 04:49:04,160
I'm not very smart, I mean.

2151
04:49:04,160 --> 04:49:06,160
No, only one hand, yeah.

2152
04:49:06,160 --> 04:49:08,160
Only one type.

2153
04:49:08,160 --> 04:49:10,160
Play only one hand type this round.

2154
04:49:10,160 --> 04:49:12,160
How does that work?

2155
04:49:12,160 --> 04:49:14,160
How the heck is that supposed to work?

2156
04:49:14,160 --> 04:49:16,160
All flushes?

2157
04:49:20,160 --> 04:49:22,160
One...

2158
04:49:22,160 --> 04:49:24,160
One kind of hand.

2159
04:49:24,160 --> 04:49:26,160
Only for peers.

2160
04:49:26,160 --> 04:49:28,160
Well, better be peers.

2161
04:49:28,160 --> 04:49:30,160
Choose two of up to five playing cards

2162
04:49:30,160 --> 04:49:32,160
to add to the deck.

2163
04:49:32,160 --> 04:49:34,160
I'm not even wanting that, if I'm being honest.

2164
04:49:34,160 --> 04:49:36,160
I'm wanting tarot.

2165
04:49:36,160 --> 04:49:44,160
Do I want this in my back pocket?

2166
04:49:48,160 --> 04:49:50,160
Decisions, decisions.

2167
04:49:50,160 --> 04:49:52,160
Yeah, have it in my back pocket?

2168
04:49:52,160 --> 04:49:54,160
Okay.

2169
04:49:54,160 --> 04:49:56,160
I don't know how to utilize it,

2170
04:49:56,160 --> 04:49:58,160
but I'm not wanting anything else for this.

2171
04:49:58,160 --> 04:50:00,160
Gives a spectral pattern.

2172
04:50:00,160 --> 04:50:02,160
No, I need tarot cards.

2173
04:50:07,160 --> 04:50:10,160
The game's pleasing me dry a little bit here.

2174
04:50:10,160 --> 04:50:12,160
You're not really giving me much to work with.

2175
04:50:12,160 --> 04:50:14,160
Literally a double, and that's it.

2176
04:50:16,160 --> 04:50:18,160
Just play that and get rid of it all.

2177
04:50:18,160 --> 04:50:20,160
Like, the game has not been nice to me.

2178
04:50:20,160 --> 04:50:22,160
Unless I'm missing something obvious,

2179
04:50:22,160 --> 04:50:24,160
that was not a nice pull.

2180
04:50:24,160 --> 04:50:26,160
Heart flush?

2181
04:50:26,160 --> 04:50:28,160
Shit.

2182
04:50:28,160 --> 04:50:30,160
For...

2183
04:50:30,160 --> 04:50:32,160
King, Queen Jack 10.

2184
04:50:32,160 --> 04:50:34,160
So I need an Ace or a Nine.

2185
04:50:36,160 --> 04:50:38,160
I'm so sorry.

2186
04:50:38,160 --> 04:50:40,160
I don't see things the way you see it.

2187
04:50:40,160 --> 04:50:42,160
I could do...

2188
04:50:42,160 --> 04:50:44,160
I could do Jacks, I can't.

2189
04:50:44,160 --> 04:50:46,160
King like that.

2190
04:50:46,160 --> 04:50:48,160
And get rid of the...

2191
04:50:48,160 --> 04:50:50,160
Oh, but four is like a good bonus.

2192
04:50:50,160 --> 04:50:52,160
Like, ever do these, maybe?

2193
04:50:54,160 --> 04:50:56,160
Aren't her pairs worth more than flushes anyway?

2194
04:50:56,160 --> 04:50:58,160
Very plausible.

2195
04:51:00,160 --> 04:51:02,160
My pair is level six right now, so...

2196
04:51:02,160 --> 04:51:04,160
RNG gods?

2197
04:51:04,160 --> 04:51:06,160
Thank you.

2198
04:51:14,160 --> 04:51:16,160
Oh yeah, my pairs are worth way more.

2199
04:51:16,160 --> 04:51:18,160
Shout out to all my pairs.

2200
04:51:18,160 --> 04:51:20,160
Cash out.

2201
04:51:20,160 --> 04:51:22,160
Ooh, what are you?

2202
04:51:22,160 --> 04:51:24,160
Allow straights to be played with gaps in them.

2203
04:51:24,160 --> 04:51:26,160
Well, I'm actually doubled out.

2204
04:51:26,160 --> 04:51:28,160
You're too late to show up.

2205
04:51:28,160 --> 04:51:30,160
I'm already down on doubles.

2206
04:51:30,160 --> 04:51:32,160
Give 20 more chips and a multiplier.

2207
04:51:36,160 --> 04:51:38,160
Well, we're going to get our tarot card multiplier up.

2208
04:51:38,160 --> 04:51:40,160
So...

2209
04:51:40,160 --> 04:51:42,160
It's a hollow joker though.

2210
04:51:42,160 --> 04:51:44,160
Is that what I'm looking at?

2211
04:51:44,160 --> 04:51:46,160
Actually sell the four plus joker and buy the straight cards.

2212
04:51:48,160 --> 04:51:50,160
And buy this one?

2213
04:51:52,160 --> 04:51:54,160
Not the scholar, buy the...

2214
04:51:54,160 --> 04:51:56,160
straight cards.

2215
04:51:56,160 --> 04:51:58,160
The straight card is 10 multiplier.

2216
04:51:58,160 --> 04:52:00,160
Okay, I trust you, Reeflings.

2217
04:52:00,160 --> 04:52:02,160
You're gating me.

2218
04:52:02,160 --> 04:52:04,160
Okay, that's a 10 multiplier.

2219
04:52:04,160 --> 04:52:06,160
Okay, and then we'll do our tarot cards

2220
04:52:06,160 --> 04:52:08,160
because we can get...

2221
04:52:08,160 --> 04:52:10,160
this will go up.

2222
04:52:10,160 --> 04:52:12,160
Enhance to two lucky cards.

2223
04:52:12,160 --> 04:52:14,160
Enhance us to the bonus cards

2224
04:52:14,160 --> 04:52:16,160
or create a random joker.

2225
04:52:16,160 --> 04:52:18,160
I think...

2226
04:52:18,160 --> 04:52:20,160
we'll do lucky cards.

2227
04:52:22,160 --> 04:52:24,160
Yeah, let's make these two lucky.

2228
04:52:24,160 --> 04:52:26,160
Let's make these two lucky.

2229
04:52:28,160 --> 04:52:30,160
It could be good, but you probably have to sell the drunk jack.

2230
04:52:32,160 --> 04:52:34,160
This game is actually insane

2231
04:52:34,160 --> 04:52:36,160
with how deep it goes.

2232
04:52:36,160 --> 04:52:38,160
It's fantastic.

2233
04:52:38,160 --> 04:52:40,160
It's honestly fantastic.

2234
04:52:40,160 --> 04:52:42,160
I'm loving it.

2235
04:52:42,160 --> 04:52:44,160
So I can get 19 bucks back.

2236
04:52:44,160 --> 04:52:46,160
I can get a planet.

2237
04:52:46,160 --> 04:52:48,160
I can do the lucky card again.

2238
04:52:48,160 --> 04:52:50,160
I'm tempted to do the lucky card.

2239
04:52:50,160 --> 04:52:52,160
I really enjoy the luck.

2240
04:52:52,160 --> 04:52:54,160
I really enjoy the luck factor

2241
04:52:54,160 --> 04:52:56,160
because

2242
04:52:56,160 --> 04:52:58,160
a 20 multiplier is insane.

2243
04:53:00,160 --> 04:53:02,160
Priestess gives you two planets though.

2244
04:53:10,160 --> 04:53:12,160
I love the luck factor,

2245
04:53:12,160 --> 04:53:14,160
but you're right.

2246
04:53:14,160 --> 04:53:16,160
Two planets, I could upgrade everything.

2247
04:53:16,160 --> 04:53:18,160
Well, not everything.

2248
04:53:18,160 --> 04:53:20,160
I could upgrade

2249
04:53:20,160 --> 04:53:22,160
and play.

2250
04:53:22,160 --> 04:53:24,160
Priestess might actually be better in this situation.

2251
04:53:26,160 --> 04:53:28,160
Okay, okay.

2252
04:53:28,160 --> 04:53:30,160
What we got? We've got four of a kind

2253
04:53:30,160 --> 04:53:32,160
and a full house. I mean, we're just going to utilize them.

2254
04:53:32,160 --> 04:53:34,160
I don't have a problem with utilizing them.

2255
04:53:36,160 --> 04:53:38,160
Right, and then we'll go next.

2256
04:53:38,160 --> 04:53:40,160
I am not interested in you.

2257
04:53:42,160 --> 04:53:44,160
Every played card permanently gains five chips.

2258
04:53:44,160 --> 04:53:46,160
I'm already on that.

2259
04:53:46,160 --> 04:53:48,160
So what are you? Allow straights to be played

2260
04:53:48,160 --> 04:53:50,160
in a gap.

2261
04:53:52,160 --> 04:53:54,160
Wait.

2262
04:53:54,160 --> 04:53:56,160
That example works?

2263
04:53:56,160 --> 04:53:58,160
Wait, it's not like five, four, three,

2264
04:53:58,160 --> 04:54:00,160
one and...

2265
04:54:04,160 --> 04:54:06,160
Wait, I'm just going to be doing straights

2266
04:54:06,160 --> 04:54:08,160
all day long then.

2267
04:54:08,160 --> 04:54:10,160
Am I misunderstanding?

2268
04:54:10,160 --> 04:54:12,160
We rose in the next shop for zero.

2269
04:54:14,160 --> 04:54:16,160
And a 10 plus multiplier on top.

2270
04:54:16,160 --> 04:54:18,160
Oh, is it the 10 multi?

2271
04:54:18,160 --> 04:54:20,160
That is what we're wanting it for.

2272
04:54:22,160 --> 04:54:24,160
So you can play very weird straights now.

2273
04:54:24,160 --> 04:54:26,160
My brain can hardly

2274
04:54:26,160 --> 04:54:28,160
like, comprehend. So what?

2275
04:54:28,160 --> 04:54:30,160
One, two,

2276
04:54:30,160 --> 04:54:32,160
skip a few.

2277
04:54:32,160 --> 04:54:34,160
Ten, skip eight.

2278
04:54:34,160 --> 04:54:36,160
No way!

2279
04:54:38,160 --> 04:54:40,160
That's redonkulous.

2280
04:54:40,160 --> 04:54:42,160
That doesn't make sense,

2281
04:54:42,160 --> 04:54:44,160
but it does!

2282
04:54:46,160 --> 04:54:48,160
It just works!

2283
04:54:48,160 --> 04:54:50,160
All right, Todd Howard.

2284
04:54:50,160 --> 04:54:52,160
You can't down there, good sir.

2285
04:54:52,160 --> 04:54:54,160
Hurry up with my Skyrim six already.

2286
04:54:54,160 --> 04:54:56,160
I'm winning.

2287
04:54:56,160 --> 04:54:58,160
Whoa, that's mean-blowing!

2288
04:55:00,160 --> 04:55:02,160
Eleven, ten.

2289
04:55:02,160 --> 04:55:04,160
Eight.

2290
04:55:04,160 --> 04:55:06,160
Well, that's ten, technically.

2291
04:55:06,160 --> 04:55:08,160
Nine and eight. Wow!

2292
04:55:08,160 --> 04:55:10,160
How bizarre!

2293
04:55:10,160 --> 04:55:12,160
I'm like twiddling

2294
04:55:12,160 --> 04:55:14,160
my hair right now

2295
04:55:14,160 --> 04:55:16,160
in between my fingers.

2296
04:55:16,160 --> 04:55:18,160
Like, what?

2297
04:55:18,160 --> 04:55:20,160
How strange.

2298
04:55:20,160 --> 04:55:22,160
So king, queen,

2299
04:55:22,160 --> 04:55:24,160
jack, ten, nine,

2300
04:55:24,160 --> 04:55:26,160
seven.

2301
04:55:26,160 --> 04:55:28,160
And what? And then we need a five

2302
04:55:28,160 --> 04:55:30,160
or six?

2303
04:55:30,160 --> 04:55:32,160
What?

2304
04:55:34,160 --> 04:55:36,160
All right, okay, okay, hold on.

2305
04:55:36,160 --> 04:55:38,160
What have we got? We've got doubles.

2306
04:55:38,160 --> 04:55:40,160
Let's do doubles.

2307
04:55:40,160 --> 04:55:42,160
That's blowing my mind.

2308
04:55:42,160 --> 04:55:44,160
Wait, have I got straight again?

2309
04:55:44,160 --> 04:55:46,160
No. Wait, no.

2310
04:55:46,160 --> 04:55:48,160
Have I?

2311
04:55:48,160 --> 04:55:50,160
King, queen, jack, ten, nine,

2312
04:55:50,160 --> 04:55:52,160
eight, seven. No!

2313
04:55:52,160 --> 04:55:54,160
Wait, that's so hard!

2314
04:55:54,160 --> 04:55:56,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2315
04:55:56,160 --> 04:55:58,160
That's like so weird!

2316
04:55:58,160 --> 04:56:00,160
How common is that card?

2317
04:56:00,160 --> 04:56:02,160
How common is that card?

2318
04:56:14,160 --> 04:56:16,160
Okay, so there's

2319
04:56:16,160 --> 04:56:18,160
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2320
04:56:20,160 --> 04:56:22,160
It worked!

2321
04:56:22,160 --> 04:56:24,160
Why does it work?

2322
04:56:24,160 --> 04:56:26,160
Wait, this card is so OP.

2323
04:56:26,160 --> 04:56:28,160
Danny, you put my stonks in the streets?

2324
04:56:28,160 --> 04:56:30,160
I think Danny, you put my stonks in the streets.

2325
04:56:32,160 --> 04:56:34,160
King, queen, jack,

2326
04:56:34,160 --> 04:56:36,160
ten, nine.

2327
04:56:36,160 --> 04:56:38,160
Okay, I don't have that.

2328
04:56:38,160 --> 04:56:40,160
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,

2329
04:56:40,160 --> 04:56:42,160
ten. Okay, so I don't have it that way.

2330
04:56:44,160 --> 04:56:46,160
Go in all in on streets.

2331
04:56:46,160 --> 04:56:48,160
I think so.

2332
04:56:48,160 --> 04:56:50,160
I think we need to maybe swap off

2333
04:56:50,160 --> 04:56:52,160
repair. Oh no, but that's got a ten plus on it.

2334
04:56:54,160 --> 04:56:56,160
Does that activate in general?

2335
04:56:56,160 --> 04:56:58,160
Okay, I'm going to get rid of all the...

2336
04:56:58,160 --> 04:57:00,160
Oh wait, no, I don't want to get rid of them.

2337
04:57:00,160 --> 04:57:02,160
I don't think so. I just want to get rid of the kings.

2338
04:57:02,160 --> 04:57:04,160
Because we're like so close to another street.

2339
04:57:04,160 --> 04:57:06,160
Oh, it's the end of the round.

2340
04:57:06,160 --> 04:57:08,160
Oh.

2341
04:57:08,160 --> 04:57:10,160
How bizarre, right?

2342
04:57:10,160 --> 04:57:12,160
Let me finish this game.

2343
04:57:12,160 --> 04:57:14,160
It's cold!

2344
04:57:14,160 --> 04:57:16,160
I can't help it.

2345
04:57:16,160 --> 04:57:18,160
Remaining hand, money, interest.

2346
04:57:18,160 --> 04:57:20,160
Oh, I got rid of my...

2347
04:57:20,160 --> 04:57:22,160
No.

2348
04:57:22,160 --> 04:57:24,160
Why did that not...

2349
04:57:24,160 --> 04:57:26,160
Why did you not activate?

2350
04:57:26,160 --> 04:57:28,160
Earn two bucks

2351
04:57:28,160 --> 04:57:30,160
per discard if no discards are used.

2352
04:57:30,160 --> 04:57:32,160
Oh, if none of them are used.

2353
04:57:32,160 --> 04:57:34,160
Okay, at all.

2354
04:57:34,160 --> 04:57:36,160
Right, what's going on here?

2355
04:57:38,160 --> 04:57:40,160
I've already had you, so

2356
04:57:40,160 --> 04:57:42,160
I don't want you.

2357
04:57:42,160 --> 04:57:44,160
There is another to make it that you only need floor cards

2358
04:57:44,160 --> 04:57:46,160
to make flushes and streets.

2359
04:57:46,160 --> 04:57:48,160
The Joker has literally changed the entire game.

2360
04:57:50,160 --> 04:57:52,160
We have...we've got a turret card

2361
04:57:52,160 --> 04:57:54,160
so we can increase our multiplier at

2362
04:57:54,160 --> 04:57:56,160
8 to 9.

2363
04:57:56,160 --> 04:57:58,160
Yes, please, sir.

2364
04:57:58,160 --> 04:58:00,160
What have we got? Planets.

2365
04:58:00,160 --> 04:58:02,160
Joker, we don't need.

2366
04:58:02,160 --> 04:58:04,160
Double's money.

2367
04:58:04,160 --> 04:58:06,160
That gives us 20.

2368
04:58:06,160 --> 04:58:08,160
That would give us full economy.

2369
04:58:10,160 --> 04:58:12,160
Wait, that gives us two more turret cards?

2370
04:58:12,160 --> 04:58:14,160
Which gives us even more of a multiplier.

2371
04:58:14,160 --> 04:58:16,160
Emperor.

2372
04:58:16,160 --> 04:58:18,160
Emperor?

2373
04:58:18,160 --> 04:58:20,160
Emperor.

2374
04:58:20,160 --> 04:58:22,160
Yeah, okay.

2375
04:58:22,160 --> 04:58:24,160
That turns us to what?

2376
04:58:24,160 --> 04:58:26,160
10?

2377
04:58:26,160 --> 04:58:28,160
Wait, that turns us to 11?

2378
04:58:28,160 --> 04:58:30,160
Enhance something into a wealth card.

2379
04:58:30,160 --> 04:58:32,160
Use the wheel.

2380
04:58:32,160 --> 04:58:34,160
I never got it.

2381
04:58:34,160 --> 04:58:36,160
But is that 10 now? Enhances one selected card

2382
04:58:36,160 --> 04:58:38,160
into a wild card.

2383
04:58:38,160 --> 04:58:40,160
I don't know what a wild card is.

2384
04:58:40,160 --> 04:58:42,160
But in Binding of Isaac,

2385
04:58:42,160 --> 04:58:44,160
we've got a wild card.

2386
04:58:44,160 --> 04:58:46,160
You hear an audio cue and the guy goes wild card.

2387
04:58:46,160 --> 04:58:48,160
I just thought you should know that.

2388
04:58:50,160 --> 04:58:52,160
Right, we will pick a planet to upgrade as well

2389
04:58:52,160 --> 04:58:54,160
because

2390
04:58:54,160 --> 04:58:56,160
I guess we want straight.

2391
04:58:56,160 --> 04:58:58,160
Not straight flush.

2392
04:58:58,160 --> 04:59:00,160
That's very unlikely

2393
04:59:00,160 --> 04:59:02,160
but a straight wild card.

2394
04:59:02,160 --> 04:59:04,160
Sorry, I'm stuck in my head now.

2395
04:59:04,160 --> 04:59:06,160
Saturn.

2396
04:59:06,160 --> 04:59:08,160
Cumberboard Saturn.

2397
04:59:08,160 --> 04:59:10,160
Right, you...

2398
04:59:10,160 --> 04:59:12,160
You don't have a multiplier with your foil.

2399
04:59:12,160 --> 04:59:14,160
You have 50 chips

2400
04:59:14,160 --> 04:59:16,160
which I'm not really sure.

2401
04:59:16,160 --> 04:59:18,160
Saturn.

2402
04:59:18,160 --> 04:59:20,160
Sell the drunk Joker.

2403
04:59:20,160 --> 04:59:22,160
The drunk Joker.

2404
04:59:22,160 --> 04:59:24,160
I have

2405
04:59:24,160 --> 04:59:26,160
the drunk card.

2406
04:59:26,160 --> 04:59:28,160
Sell the drunk card.

2407
04:59:30,160 --> 04:59:32,160
I would pick the foil Joker

2408
04:59:32,160 --> 04:59:34,160
and switch it for the discard.

2409
04:59:34,160 --> 04:59:36,160
Okay, thank you.

2410
04:59:36,160 --> 04:59:38,160
You and you come.

2411
04:59:38,160 --> 04:59:40,160
God ranks give chips when...

2412
04:59:40,160 --> 04:59:42,160
Okay, okay.

2413
04:59:42,160 --> 04:59:44,160
I comprehend interesting.

2414
04:59:44,160 --> 04:59:46,160
I like it. I'll use the lover's card

2415
04:59:46,160 --> 04:59:48,160
and then our multiplier will go to what?

2416
04:59:48,160 --> 04:59:50,160
Ten.

2417
04:59:50,160 --> 04:59:52,160
Fantastic.

2418
04:59:52,160 --> 04:59:54,160
Fan.

2419
04:59:54,160 --> 04:59:56,160
Chips.

2420
04:59:56,160 --> 04:59:58,160
That's kind of scary.

2421
04:59:58,160 --> 05:00:00,160
Play only one hand this round.

2422
05:00:00,160 --> 05:00:02,160
I'm a bit nervous.

2423
05:00:02,160 --> 05:00:04,160
Alright.

2424
05:00:08,160 --> 05:00:10,160
Enhance one into a wild card.

2425
05:00:10,160 --> 05:00:12,160
One hand type.

2426
05:00:12,160 --> 05:00:14,160
So...

2427
05:00:14,160 --> 05:00:16,160
Go with either pairs or straights.

2428
05:00:16,160 --> 05:00:18,160
Play only straight.

2429
05:00:20,160 --> 05:00:22,160
I don't have a straight.

2430
05:00:22,160 --> 05:00:24,160
No ASMR.

2431
05:00:24,160 --> 05:00:26,160
No, it's coming. Once we redirect into Azure

2432
05:00:26,160 --> 05:00:28,160
I'm doing my ASMR.

2433
05:00:28,160 --> 05:00:30,160
You might hear the birds outside though.

2434
05:00:30,160 --> 05:00:32,160
That's only...

2435
05:00:32,160 --> 05:00:34,160
That's only done so I didn't ASMR a bit later.

2436
05:00:34,160 --> 05:00:36,160
Hand type.

2437
05:00:36,160 --> 05:00:38,160
You can just play straights.

2438
05:00:38,160 --> 05:00:40,160
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

2439
05:00:40,160 --> 05:00:42,160
six, five, four.

2440
05:00:42,160 --> 05:00:44,160
Right, so I need to get rid of

2441
05:00:44,160 --> 05:00:46,160
all of these.

2442
05:00:46,160 --> 05:00:48,160
Even the four?

2443
05:00:48,160 --> 05:00:50,160
Wild card.

2444
05:00:50,160 --> 05:00:52,160
Sorry, that's really stuck in my head.

2445
05:00:52,160 --> 05:00:54,160
I'll discard these

2446
05:00:54,160 --> 05:00:56,160
and we'll go for a flush.

2447
05:00:56,160 --> 05:00:58,160
Discard some sevens.

2448
05:00:58,160 --> 05:01:02,160
Ten, nine, eight, sevens.

2449
05:01:02,160 --> 05:01:04,160
Help.

2450
05:01:04,160 --> 05:01:06,160
Jeez, I'm a waste. Do you guys not want me

2451
05:01:06,160 --> 05:01:08,160
to win or something? What's going on here?

2452
05:01:08,160 --> 05:01:10,160
King is very far away from ten.

2453
05:01:12,160 --> 05:01:14,160
Wait, I got a straight. Stop. Stop.

2454
05:01:14,160 --> 05:01:16,160
Where?

2455
05:01:16,160 --> 05:01:18,160
I don't have a straight.

2456
05:01:18,160 --> 05:01:20,160
King.

2457
05:01:20,160 --> 05:01:22,160
Queen. Jack.

2458
05:01:24,160 --> 05:01:26,160
Ace, king, ten.

2459
05:01:29,160 --> 05:01:32,160
Wait, queen and joker.

2460
05:01:32,160 --> 05:01:34,160
Queen and jack get skipped

2461
05:01:34,160 --> 05:01:36,160
between these two?

2462
05:01:36,160 --> 05:01:38,160
No, you said a flush.

2463
05:01:38,160 --> 05:01:40,160
Wait, never mind. Yeah.

2464
05:01:40,160 --> 05:01:42,160
Toss one of the nine and keep a ten.

2465
05:01:42,160 --> 05:01:44,160
She wants straights,

2466
05:01:44,160 --> 05:01:46,160
not flushes. No, you can't make a straight.

2467
05:01:46,160 --> 05:01:48,160
I didn't think so.

2468
05:01:50,160 --> 05:01:52,160
So ditch this nine and these two.

2469
05:01:52,160 --> 05:01:54,160
Discard nine of hearts, discard four.

2470
05:01:54,160 --> 05:01:56,160
But not three? Why not three?

2471
05:01:56,160 --> 05:01:58,160
Why not three?

2472
05:01:58,160 --> 05:02:00,160
Wait a minute, why did you not mention the three?

2473
05:02:04,160 --> 05:02:06,160
I don't know.

2474
05:02:08,160 --> 05:02:10,160
I'm going to need to make a play.

2475
05:02:10,160 --> 05:02:12,160
My discards are getting off.

2476
05:02:12,160 --> 05:02:14,160
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

2477
05:02:16,160 --> 05:02:18,160
Yeah, okay, right.

2478
05:02:18,160 --> 05:02:20,160
Lovers, what's a wild card though?

2479
05:02:20,160 --> 05:02:22,160
That I put ten on?

2480
05:02:22,160 --> 05:02:24,160
That I just randomly put the ace on a wild card?

2481
05:02:24,160 --> 05:02:26,160
Sure, what does it do? I don't know.

2482
05:02:28,160 --> 05:02:30,160
Can be used as any suit.

2483
05:02:30,160 --> 05:02:32,160
Sure.

2484
05:02:32,160 --> 05:02:34,160
Play.

2485
05:02:40,160 --> 05:02:42,160
Nine, eight, seven.

2486
05:02:42,160 --> 05:02:44,160
Shit.

2487
05:02:44,160 --> 05:02:46,160
We've, oh no, we've fucked it.

2488
05:02:46,160 --> 05:02:48,160
We've fucked it.

2489
05:02:52,160 --> 05:02:54,160
We've ballsed it up.

2490
05:02:56,160 --> 05:02:58,160
I've ballsed it up because I used so many discards.

2491
05:02:58,160 --> 05:03:00,160
Used the last discard.

2492
05:03:00,160 --> 05:03:02,160
Reroll a three and a two.

2493
05:03:02,160 --> 05:03:04,160
Man, you're actually getting awful draws.

2494
05:03:04,160 --> 05:03:06,160
Streamer Luck can only lead stretch so far.

2495
05:03:08,160 --> 05:03:10,160
Discard all the threes and twos.

2496
05:03:10,160 --> 05:03:12,160
And the four?

2497
05:03:12,160 --> 05:03:14,160
Or not the four?

2498
05:03:14,160 --> 05:03:16,160
Jobu Nogo.

2499
05:03:16,160 --> 05:03:18,160
Thank you for the membership.

2500
05:03:18,160 --> 05:03:20,160
I appreciate it.

2501
05:03:20,160 --> 05:03:22,160
You have a good basis though.

2502
05:03:22,160 --> 05:03:24,160
For a lot of straights.

2503
05:03:24,160 --> 05:03:26,160
So get rid of this side. Leave the four.

2504
05:03:26,160 --> 05:03:28,160
I'd keep the four, not the four.

2505
05:03:28,160 --> 05:03:30,160
Just the threes and the twos.

2506
05:03:30,160 --> 05:03:32,160
Last discard.

2507
05:03:32,160 --> 05:03:34,160
It's either make or break.

2508
05:03:34,160 --> 05:03:36,160
Um...

2509
05:03:42,160 --> 05:03:44,160
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four!

2510
05:03:50,160 --> 05:03:52,160
Ok, ok let them get up, let them get up, let them get up!

2511
05:03:52,160 --> 05:03:54,160
Hold on.

2512
05:03:54,160 --> 05:03:56,160
Oh, thank goodness, that was not fun.

2513
05:03:56,160 --> 05:03:58,160
I didn't enjoy that.

2514
05:03:58,160 --> 05:04:00,160
Don't do that to me again.

2515
05:04:00,160 --> 05:04:08,800
absolutely we'll muck around with tarot cards no problem wait what's this one

2516
05:04:08,800 --> 05:04:18,060
consumable slot so I can have even more tarot cards mega arcane use two

2517
05:04:18,060 --> 05:04:22,980
tarots right we're gonna buy and use the planets right now got a bit of

2518
05:04:22,980 --> 05:04:28,540
Uranus please use and a bit of Venus please use for three of a kind

2519
05:04:28,540 --> 05:04:32,740
unfortunately didn't roll Saturn which is what we were wanting but that's fine

2520
05:04:32,740 --> 05:04:41,740
tarot open up please come to me right ladies and gentlemen we can double money

2521
05:04:41,740 --> 05:04:47,700
for a max of 20 which we can achieve create a card destroy two cards increase

2522
05:04:47,700 --> 05:04:55,440
the rank and mid game or enhance one selected card into a stone card when

2523
05:04:55,440 --> 05:05:02,520
can you use vouchers mid game I mean no vouchers always occur oh actually yeah I

2524
05:05:02,520 --> 05:05:10,200
don't know when the director's cut could be activated 20 is 20 you're you are

2525
05:05:10,200 --> 05:05:14,160
factually correct I am inclined to agree actually don't want to destroy

2526
05:05:14,160 --> 05:05:19,160
anything because if we've now got this weird suit thing going on destroying is

2527
05:05:19,160 --> 05:05:23,160
bad we don't want Joker that's useless we don't really need to change anything

2528
05:05:23,320 --> 05:05:27,440
into the same thing because we're going for a weird flush so yeah hermit is our

2529
05:05:27,440 --> 05:05:34,200
only option there we go 20 bucks right not you not you again don't want to

2530
05:05:34,200 --> 05:05:41,280
destroy cards or create a Joker wow okay this is useless is this a skip all

2531
05:05:41,280 --> 05:05:49,520
but but our multiplier you know what I can take it I don't want to actually use

2532
05:05:49,560 --> 05:05:54,320
it I thought it was gonna let me take it and then I could just sell it yeah I

2533
05:05:54,320 --> 05:06:04,960
thought I could take it I destroy high and low no the problem is we have what's

2534
05:06:04,960 --> 05:06:11,240
called shortcut it allows straights to be inaccurate you could bump the three and

2535
05:06:11,240 --> 05:06:18,160
fours to four and five centering the value you know what you like beyond a

2536
05:06:18,160 --> 05:06:24,440
certain what do you want me to do you can bump the three and fours wait so

2537
05:06:24,440 --> 05:06:32,800
should I make the three or four and then that would raise the bar

2538
05:06:32,800 --> 05:06:43,720
increase the strip the rank increases rank of the two cards selected by one

2539
05:06:43,720 --> 05:06:53,000
card okay okay that was good we are now 14 multiply which is fantastic we don't

2540
05:06:53,000 --> 05:06:57,920
need a Joker we don't need a consumable slot we're actually about to hit max

2541
05:06:57,960 --> 05:07:03,320
economy which is fantastic for us because our little discards this one

2542
05:07:03,320 --> 05:07:11,360
really isn't hitting it isn't hitting as hard anymore so I might want to

2543
05:07:11,360 --> 05:07:17,960
replace but gives us a negative Joker slot on the domestic is an extra slot so

2544
05:07:17,960 --> 05:07:25,760
I can't get rid of it right next round delayed gratifications and I am

2545
05:07:25,800 --> 05:07:33,280
learning and make a standard pack no I want that rocked cards right we can

2546
05:07:33,280 --> 05:07:37,800
still do our little Duble V at the moment was at nine wait hold on five six

2547
05:07:37,800 --> 05:07:48,840
seven eight nine ten oh wait that's a flush I think I'm better doing my pairs

2548
05:07:48,840 --> 05:07:56,400
yeah pairs are better right now so just throw them away and go for a little

2549
05:07:56,400 --> 05:08:01,640
flush I don't know maybe it's terrible sorry for folk that sorry for folk that

2550
05:08:01,640 --> 05:08:08,560
but I'm trying well I got 13k for that yeah seven six five four three two one

2551
05:08:08,560 --> 05:08:12,480
of course I'm not gonna card that would be too easy let's just do doubles I think

2552
05:08:12,480 --> 05:08:17,840
we've got all we can do a full house and yeah because a single pair is heavily

2553
05:08:17,840 --> 05:08:23,000
boosted single pair please better than two pairs wait

2554
05:08:23,160 --> 05:08:37,400
single pair who says single pair please better who says run info how do you do

2555
05:08:37,400 --> 05:08:44,640
the mass straight flush two pair is 60 times four

2556
05:08:47,840 --> 05:08:53,600
oh wow wait it was 85 times seven that's a big number

2557
05:08:53,600 --> 05:08:59,560
wait oh no don't maybe the math oh no you're right a single pair is far

2558
05:08:59,560 --> 05:09:08,240
stronger wow okay and what are you odd numbers so a double seven is stronger

2559
05:09:08,240 --> 05:09:15,160
than a Wow this game wait wait wait let me I know give me I need to some

2560
05:09:15,160 --> 05:09:22,840
freaking math in my head I'm like that's a bigger number you're right 11,000

2561
05:09:22,840 --> 05:09:28,680
for two singular pair wow we need that half cut off card again and we're laughing

2562
05:09:28,680 --> 05:09:40,280
to the bank hmm right we've got 69 bucks play played face card gives 30 right

2563
05:09:40,280 --> 05:09:44,840
I'm gonna buy this because our economy is good and we've got two tarot cards

2564
05:09:45,120 --> 05:09:50,920
let's do you thank you redeemed thank you right jumbo what see what we're

2565
05:09:50,920 --> 05:09:57,760
dealing with give us a suit right no to the glass card and the last thing we

2566
05:09:57,760 --> 05:10:01,280
used was strength which I've already forgotten what does it in this game I

2567
05:10:01,280 --> 05:10:07,680
think strength increases your health by one in Isaac as well as a speed and

2568
05:10:07,680 --> 05:10:16,640
possibly damage 69 nice big bank of our it says there oh increases rank of

2569
05:10:16,640 --> 05:10:26,640
two selected cards ah so we are officially created a five and four so

2570
05:10:26,640 --> 05:10:32,560
can we just do it again anyway two selected car no enhance one into a

2571
05:10:32,560 --> 05:10:38,720
wild card sorry convert no right actually yeah the fool is the best thing

2572
05:10:38,720 --> 05:10:44,800
we can probably do right here so we made an artificial five that isn't really a

2573
05:10:44,800 --> 05:11:00,800
five but we can bump up to a six so there should be a double five okay hearts

2574
05:11:00,800 --> 05:11:09,760
have a double five which is fine so you have more fives than normal and less

2575
05:11:09,760 --> 05:11:17,160
threes so I don't want to read you don't have to worry too much if you use the

2576
05:11:17,160 --> 05:11:30,560
fuel it will go back to the shop yeah and spades doesn't have a three I'm not

2577
05:11:30,560 --> 05:11:34,840
smart enough to do it

2578
05:11:34,840 --> 05:11:47,760
huh my dumb very dumb very dumb it's okay I'm allowed to be dumb make two lucky

2579
05:11:47,760 --> 05:11:57,640
cards hearts or a steel card chariot oh this is hard because I'm trying to do

2580
05:11:58,360 --> 05:12:04,880
what a straight so having a chariot on standby I don't know if I'm better because

2581
05:12:04,880 --> 05:12:09,360
I'm going to be going through so many cards it might be better to have two

2582
05:12:09,360 --> 05:12:21,000
lucky cards steal the three really and then hope the other cards are straight

2583
05:12:21,000 --> 05:12:23,560
when I get them

2584
05:12:26,120 --> 05:12:33,480
not do this now oh I can do that now hold on right what my two strengths use

2585
05:12:33,480 --> 05:12:37,880
strength here first yes sorry I noticed I was gonna do that and what is steel

2586
05:12:37,880 --> 05:12:43,960
steel is a 1.5 multiplier if it just sits in your hand like you don't utilize it

2587
05:12:43,960 --> 05:12:52,120
it gives a big thing use strength on three and four I guess since they're low

2588
05:12:52,120 --> 05:12:57,640
numbers we want to bump everything upwards of five so we can always push

2589
05:12:57,640 --> 05:13:04,040
towards and you can save strength using as an emergency the multiplier though

2590
05:13:04,040 --> 05:13:10,520
we're at 15 multiplier just on fortune teller so I'm just gonna go balls to the

2591
05:13:10,520 --> 05:13:18,240
wall with it we're now at 16 multiplier right and then we'll lose oh someone

2592
05:13:18,240 --> 05:13:25,000
wants me to steal you can save now well I've already used it now strength on five

2593
05:13:25,000 --> 05:13:34,960
and four what about multi steal the four okay I'm doing it I'm doing as a

2594
05:13:34,960 --> 05:13:40,320
reflander man we're now 17 multiply which is fantastic four of a kind I'm not

2595
05:13:40,320 --> 05:13:48,280
even going for you let's go next please nah I don't need free jokers I've got

2596
05:13:48,280 --> 05:13:53,920
quite an interesting joker right King Queen Jack 1098 well there you go

2597
05:13:53,920 --> 05:14:07,880
straight already yes yes 13,000 for that what we already got a little baby

2598
05:14:07,880 --> 05:14:14,920
straight over here oh no we don't close to no cigar and these Kings are gonna

2599
05:14:14,920 --> 05:14:21,000
give insanely good stuff but the I'm so close to getting something here I'm

2600
05:14:21,000 --> 05:14:25,800
wondering if I should just throw that away and go for like a low straight I do

2601
05:14:25,800 --> 05:14:29,520
have a pair of Kings oh wait yeah that's right I have a pair shut up tell my

2602
05:14:29,520 --> 05:14:34,360
pairs I still have a pair boom because I'd leveled up pairs so much going all

2603
05:14:34,360 --> 05:14:43,680
in with them right King Queen Jack 10 I don't have a baby pair I have three

2604
05:14:43,680 --> 05:14:53,720
rounds so I'm not very stressed out about it I'm just gonna play this pair here

2605
05:14:53,720 --> 05:14:57,680
and kind of clear out the inventory and try and go high for a bit because I did

2606
05:14:57,680 --> 05:15:03,520
put my money into high like making other cards at a higher value so yes not

2607
05:15:03,560 --> 05:15:07,120
problem not problem we're getting there delayed gratification 21 bucks don't

2608
05:15:07,120 --> 05:15:12,800
mind if I do oh this joker gains two Maltese of hand played contains two

2609
05:15:12,800 --> 05:15:26,800
pair brah we're trying to swap straight I need tarot cars give me tarot yes I

2610
05:15:26,800 --> 05:15:38,840
can buy diamonds the chariot oh wait enhance one slighted card into a steel

2611
05:15:38,840 --> 05:15:43,960
card I wouldn't mind doing that again honestly creates up to two random well

2612
05:15:43,960 --> 05:15:48,280
that's even more the Emperor's just infinite glitch seven yeah what's it

2613
05:15:48,280 --> 05:15:54,000
okay glass car and don't actually want to use it on a wild car oh wait oh no I'm

2614
05:15:54,080 --> 05:16:00,080
inventory I actually don't want to make a glass card enhance one selected card

2615
05:16:00,080 --> 05:16:11,120
into a gold card if I buy this oh oh wait I can hold three oh my gosh I'm so

2616
05:16:11,120 --> 05:16:16,280
smart choose up to one of three playing cards add to the deck let's give it a

2617
05:16:17,240 --> 05:16:27,120
peach create a planet card for final played poker hand around if held in hand

2618
05:16:27,120 --> 05:16:34,640
must have room I mean a 10 is high and either way it's like good if we get any

2619
05:16:34,640 --> 05:16:39,160
more cards that are in the higher end of things that's just a free Saturn got it

2620
05:16:39,480 --> 05:16:46,600
say less say less are we considering this Joker I don't think so it says two

2621
05:16:46,600 --> 05:16:52,160
pairs but we're doing straights from around here so no thank you we're going

2622
05:16:52,160 --> 05:16:56,240
to go ham using all of these and then we are going to get a 20 multiplier from

2623
05:16:56,240 --> 05:17:04,440
fortune teller alone the pants might be better than your right most Joker this

2624
05:17:04,600 --> 05:17:11,600
good this gives chips but not multiplayer I mean you might be right this

2625
05:17:11,600 --> 05:17:18,720
just gives chips but the multiplayer is so much better I wouldn't I wouldn't give

2626
05:17:18,720 --> 05:17:24,800
odd Todd I if anything I'd actually sell hiker isn't hiker not adding so much to

2627
05:17:24,800 --> 05:17:32,840
the game because I got him at the start that gives one point five on the multi

2628
05:17:32,840 --> 05:17:39,440
to hikers add in a lot of chips in the background hikers still very valuable I

2629
05:17:39,440 --> 05:17:42,680
think because I had him at the start is valuable if he showed up late game

2630
05:17:42,680 --> 05:17:48,280
completely agree with you like no and that's the 10 multiplayer not getting

2631
05:17:48,280 --> 05:17:52,120
rid of that definitely not getting rid of that so really it is as odd Todd is

2632
05:17:52,120 --> 05:18:02,040
goner and but hiker doesn't add much now slide joker is probably the worst

2633
05:18:02,040 --> 05:18:11,000
what I've got right now but he's a 10 holographic 10 multiplier but you could

2634
05:18:11,000 --> 05:18:15,240
survive without him right now hiker added the value already doesn't go away

2635
05:18:15,240 --> 05:18:25,400
right even after you sell it 1.5 versus 10 chips okay I think you're right it's

2636
05:18:25,400 --> 05:18:34,120
either hiker or odd Todd too this is a situation where any of the choices might

2637
05:18:34,120 --> 05:18:40,800
be good because I am doing so much straight stuff like with straights it

2638
05:18:40,800 --> 05:18:45,320
might be better to keep odd Todd and get rid of the hiker since he's just he's

2639
05:18:45,320 --> 05:18:52,840
very he's doing increasing very slowly so I am gonna make a mistake and pick

2640
05:18:52,840 --> 05:18:56,680
hiker but that's my gut is telling me hiker doesn't make sense at this point

2641
05:18:56,680 --> 05:19:02,520
in time the Joker games to a multiplier of played hands contain two pairs so

2642
05:19:02,520 --> 05:19:09,960
we're gonna do a few pairs on purpose on poor pause and we will also utilize all

2643
05:19:09,960 --> 05:19:21,400
these cards and so we oh it's the last run base chips and multis are halved the

2644
05:19:21,400 --> 05:19:36,760
flint okay I want to keep you nine eight seven good thing you have a lot of

2645
05:19:36,760 --> 05:19:47,560
bonuses yes all right what's going on we're here well okay I am just gonna use

2646
05:19:47,560 --> 05:19:58,120
these like no but is it lovers because what do you do can be used as a any suit

2647
05:19:58,120 --> 05:20:03,520
it enhance the card into a golden one I'm just using it on random there's not

2648
05:20:03,560 --> 05:20:11,360
really a logic to it and you're you 20 now and a glass card I really don't like

2649
05:20:11,360 --> 05:20:18,000
the idea surely the first glass card I ever use will not actually destroy the

2650
05:20:18,000 --> 05:20:28,120
card well we added an artificial 10 so really we should destroy a 10 right I'll

2651
05:20:28,120 --> 05:20:32,240
do five twos and then if an attend shows up with added an artificial one that

2652
05:20:32,240 --> 05:20:50,160
doesn't oh let's see what we look for round one right King Queen Jack skip eight

2653
05:20:50,160 --> 05:20:57,760
nine that's a straight I'm gonna destroy the three right now so it doesn't matter

2654
05:20:57,760 --> 05:21:06,400
if it gets destroyed oh wow actually stayed oh I didn't understand what that

2655
05:21:06,400 --> 05:21:10,880
was gonna do like the nine chips three bucks if you get to keep it in your hand

2656
05:21:10,880 --> 05:21:14,580
though I wanted to keep this in my hand creates the planet card for the final

2657
05:21:14,580 --> 05:21:27,860
plate poker hand all around if held in hand play if held in hand

2658
05:21:27,860 --> 05:21:42,700
two pairs play and then we can upgrade sat and it was a net Saturn Saturn oh it's

2659
05:21:42,700 --> 05:21:51,020
Uranus shoot oh that's two pair multiplier though that's not bad at all yeah sure thank

2660
05:21:51,020 --> 05:21:56,700
you right what's this all card impacts are cheaper yes please let's redeem that

2661
05:21:56,700 --> 05:22:05,500
now so we can fire sale oh that's a good one hand size goes up by one if poker

2662
05:22:05,500 --> 05:22:11,500
hand is a straight flush no that's too rare even I've never done that but we're

2663
05:22:11,500 --> 05:22:22,180
tarot carded out the wazoo what we got increase ranked destroy convert I guess

2664
05:22:22,180 --> 05:22:32,620
increase rank and keep everything increase rank oh wait sorry I'll try and

2665
05:22:32,620 --> 05:22:37,540
push everything up on the other side of the board and then we can use two tarot

2666
05:22:37,540 --> 05:22:44,740
cards which again is gonna make this guy go out the wazoo Joker stone parts

2667
05:22:44,740 --> 05:22:56,740
planet our 16 bucks back I want to say planet yeah planet come on give me what

2668
05:22:56,740 --> 05:23:07,900
I need four of a kind sure and then airs full house sure right well got 16 bucks

2669
05:23:07,900 --> 05:23:15,420
Joker don't need stone don't want don't want right fit 16 boxes 16 bucks what we

2670
05:23:15,420 --> 05:23:23,860
are 24 multiplier it's going up we're not gonna oh we can't re-roll we're above

2671
05:23:23,860 --> 05:23:31,860
50 one re-roll I don't want to use it though

2672
05:23:32,860 --> 05:23:37,540
we're just gonna upgrade everything right one more one more re-roll

2673
05:23:37,540 --> 05:23:46,940
goodness goodness to pair yes okay next round we're at 50 we're at the top next

2674
05:23:46,940 --> 05:23:53,460
no we're cuz the economy is good we don't need it you know we don't need it I'd buy

2675
05:23:53,460 --> 05:23:59,740
the stars just above fortune teller I think I have to use it but I don't want

2676
05:23:59,740 --> 05:24:03,100
to oh wait does it make a difference if I shuffle decks it doesn't make a

2677
05:24:03,100 --> 05:24:09,620
difference I don't go for straight flushes all right we're gonna keep that

2678
05:24:09,620 --> 05:24:15,100
juicy tens sitting high and dry wait if I do I think I actually need to

2679
05:24:15,100 --> 05:24:21,460
purposely do two pairs two pair yes and then odd is gonna activate on the five

2680
05:24:21,460 --> 05:24:28,420
is Jack considered an odd I guess so I love straight that fine now to do right

2681
05:24:28,420 --> 05:24:34,020
if it okay so this gun yeah okay okay I'm happy with the two pairs let's go

2682
05:24:39,220 --> 05:24:46,020
lovely jubb leaving we love to see it right you get to stay in my hand so does

2683
05:24:46,020 --> 05:24:51,260
the 10 everything else honestly can be shoved out the window question mark

2684
05:24:51,460 --> 05:24:59,060
nothing else is complimenting so I could probably go for she's gorilla in nearly

2685
05:24:59,060 --> 05:25:03,740
one shot that yeah I can't believe them right so I'm gonna leave you on purpose

2686
05:25:03,740 --> 05:25:08,300
everything else I'm just gonna go for some sort of high double cuz my cards are

2687
05:25:08,300 --> 05:25:16,820
higher right you and wait maybe a single pair will do it shout out to all my

2688
05:25:16,820 --> 05:25:27,860
pairs a single pair might do it a single pair did it absolutely use mercury

2689
05:25:27,860 --> 05:25:35,420
holy crap that's two cars we got we got 16 bucks for that feels good man a

2690
05:25:35,420 --> 05:25:44,300
straight absolutely yes please celestial planet and turret but we're

2691
05:25:44,300 --> 05:25:53,220
gonna get both so it's not problem Saturn again oh feels freakin good man I

2692
05:25:53,220 --> 05:26:01,740
think we may actually win this choose one of the turret cards yet strength 16

2693
05:26:01,740 --> 05:26:07,140
bucks something into a gold card if you hold it you get money I don't really

2694
05:26:07,140 --> 05:26:13,980
need money like that and a glass part no I think just money again and real increase

2695
05:26:13,980 --> 05:26:17,060
the rank of a car

2696
05:26:20,820 --> 05:26:31,260
do I do it that increase these not money money money money money money money

2697
05:26:31,260 --> 05:26:38,500
strength strength on the twos okay strength on the twos let's do that we

2698
05:26:38,500 --> 05:26:43,020
still get a multiplayer up for doing it so we're gonna re-roll no we're not

2699
05:26:43,060 --> 05:26:48,420
we're too poor we're in 59 okay let's play it safe we're not gonna don't need

2700
05:26:48,420 --> 05:26:52,060
to re-roll anything else how are you doing you're six multiplier right now

2701
05:26:52,060 --> 05:26:55,860
so we're gonna try and get a few more twos and that's so cool on the eyes I

2702
05:26:55,860 --> 05:26:59,460
don't know how well it translates on stream but that's so cool on the eyes

2703
05:26:59,460 --> 05:27:05,540
that's exactly how it looks when you get like a card like that and really no I

2704
05:27:05,540 --> 05:27:11,540
don't need to skip 52 lose a dollar per card that's fine I do not mind the tooth

2705
05:27:11,580 --> 05:27:21,540
give me the tooth every round I'll take it right we could do two doubles again

2706
05:27:21,540 --> 05:27:28,140
and get this guy leveled up again further and I think that's probably the

2707
05:27:28,140 --> 05:27:31,500
wisest delayed gratification I don't know how much we're actually needing you

2708
05:27:31,500 --> 05:27:36,740
hang about now I'm gonna do two dubs I know I should probably can go for

2709
05:27:36,740 --> 05:27:39,900
straights because we're putting all our money into it but it looks pretty good

2710
05:27:39,900 --> 05:27:45,700
to me oh the card didn't break

2711
05:27:47,700 --> 05:27:56,300
um thank you I'll take it so now currently on 8 multi oh my god this is

2712
05:27:56,300 --> 05:28:01,860
so satisfying so satisfying like oh yeah it's all coming together you only care

2713
05:28:01,860 --> 05:28:05,140
about delayed gratification because it's a negative okay so it's not going

2714
05:28:05,140 --> 05:28:15,220
anywhere but and we just have one pair hanging out you know that we have four

2715
05:28:15,220 --> 05:28:22,180
rounds it's not really a big deal if we do like a lore thing like this on it the

2716
05:28:22,180 --> 05:28:30,860
singular pair the singular pair one is whoa oh my god and we got fricking to

2717
05:28:31,140 --> 05:28:38,580
yes use it now oh my god what are you enhance the steel card yes justice

2718
05:28:38,580 --> 05:28:44,340
enhance one selected and I got sure knock yourself out one planet card to use

2719
05:28:44,340 --> 05:28:48,660
come on give a Saturn baby oh close enough high card full house for the kind

2720
05:28:48,660 --> 05:29:01,660
I never get for a full house is three and two and and the two will compliment

2721
05:29:01,660 --> 05:29:06,540
pair I think airs earth is the best choice yes I agree with you sorry after I

2722
05:29:06,540 --> 05:29:10,540
did the effect after I did the math in my head I agree with you that that is the

2723
05:29:10,540 --> 05:29:15,580
best choice full house contains a pair isn't two and two better at this point

2724
05:29:15,700 --> 05:29:21,620
and I let's see let's see what it actually claims I wish I would do the

2725
05:29:21,620 --> 05:29:26,020
number math for me instead of giving me percentage like times I understand it

2726
05:29:26,020 --> 05:29:35,140
can't do it but a singular pair is 800 two pairs of 600 okay I need to remember

2727
05:29:35,140 --> 05:29:41,900
a singular pair truly is stronger but a straight is insanely strong four of a

2728
05:29:41,900 --> 05:29:47,900
kind honestly isn't lagging behind too much nor is the full house so who's

2729
05:29:47,900 --> 05:29:57,420
stronger a straight and then a pair not two pairs stop playing two pairs and we

2730
05:29:57,420 --> 05:30:02,060
don't need a new Joker Joker card and we're gonna use these right

2731
05:30:02,060 --> 05:30:07,380
eeps okay I lose a buck every time a player brown that's fine it doesn't

2732
05:30:08,140 --> 05:30:12,900
convert three cards into diamonds that doesn't make a difference because we're

2733
05:30:12,900 --> 05:30:20,460
not we're not doing suits or anything like that so it doesn't matter two pairs

2734
05:30:20,460 --> 05:30:26,460
add a permanent multiplier ah yes I forgot about that part go for straight

2735
05:30:26,460 --> 05:30:33,900
flush yeah two pairs just make a bunch of diamonds like a diamond in the sky right

2736
05:30:33,940 --> 05:30:43,900
so never on 27 enhances something into a steel card sure let's just make you a

2737
05:30:43,900 --> 05:30:51,420
steel car may steal the three sorry sorry alright steel three just say and

2738
05:30:51,420 --> 05:30:59,340
then a chance to destroy a car sure I'm just gonna use that wine now we are now

2739
05:30:59,380 --> 05:31:07,420
49 multi-pliers just getting juicy I'm here for it right just do a singular

2740
05:31:07,420 --> 05:31:14,220
pair a singular pair is stronger than a double kind of not quite nine eight

2741
05:31:14,220 --> 05:31:23,260
seven six five four three up nine eight seven six five four three oh no I want to

2742

2774
05:35:32,040 --> 05:35:41,760
seven for the straight yep right let me do some math 100 times 8 is 800 100 times

2775
05:35:41,760 --> 05:35:54,560
7 700 and then add 5 which makes it 840 so two pairs are now stronger close

2776
05:35:54,560 --> 05:35:59,440
enough close enough I know that the two pairs are stronger it's close enough

2777
05:35:59,480 --> 05:36:05,560
okay I don't know how to do math I'm just happy to be here I'm at the big

2778
05:36:05,560 --> 05:36:10,200
number good she knows her math sometimes I have to do it in like segments I have

2779
05:36:10,200 --> 05:36:13,720
to always do stuff times by five and then or times by ten and like trying to

2780
05:36:13,720 --> 05:36:17,080
the other way around two pairs orders we don't even have to tell you anything

2781
05:36:17,080 --> 05:36:22,120

2786
05:37:05,800 --> 05:37:10,680

2787
05:37:10,680 --> 05:37:14,440
flush I'm just gonna buy these because I can I've got the money I've got the

2788
05:37:14,440 --> 05:37:19,240
disposable income please use your disposable income don't need a joker card

2789
05:37:19,400 --> 05:37:26,440
I didn't eat a reroll I said I need a reroll when small blind or big blind is

2790
05:37:26,440 --> 05:37:46,400
like to gain one more give me it okay I am satisfied steal that ten we rule

2791
05:37:46,400 --> 05:38:08,800
your jokers are perfect I don't want to skip the shop shit the odds of us getting

2792
05:38:08,800 --> 05:38:14,840
straights are very high if we increase our hand size by three but if we increase

2793
05:38:15,000 --> 05:38:26,160
if we skip the shop we might miss out on something big don't skip boss reroll what

2794
05:38:26,160 --> 05:38:32,120
what what have can I tell what it's gonna reroll into it just is very large blind

2795
05:38:32,120 --> 05:38:42,040
I assume there's no reroll in the final boss it's random it might make it worse

2796
05:38:42,080 --> 05:38:50,480
like if it turns around and says you can't play whatever no we're making sorry

2797
05:38:50,480 --> 05:39:00,600
we're making like 60,000 per hand I think I'm better playing and trying to get

2798
05:39:00,600 --> 05:39:08,000
another multiplier I think play to beat three you need to hit straights like

2799
05:39:08,080 --> 05:39:12,640
crazy reroll I am all then you have like six rerolls on the boss

2800
05:39:20,160 --> 05:39:26,400
my brain is telling me play this go to the shop I can upgrade I can play these two and upgrade

2801
05:39:26,400 --> 05:39:32,720
this by like 32 as well max procs thank you for coming a member during such a stressful time

2802
05:39:33,360 --> 05:39:38,320
we're gonna do it I think I'd risk the boss reroll as it stands you have to hit

2803
05:39:38,320 --> 05:39:44,320
straights every single and that's rough go with your boss normal number is much lower than

2804
05:39:44,320 --> 05:40:01,760
that runes or streaks fuck

2805
05:40:01,760 --> 05:40:24,640
cerulean bell means it's it's fine I won wait so does skip to have three more in my hand

2806
05:40:24,640 --> 05:40:32,640
and then I can play these like as I get in because it'll add to the multiplier yeah you can do it or

2807
05:40:32,640 --> 05:40:48,080
fuck oh fuck I'll show this right what's going on a wild card or do you do 10 queen okay I can't go

2808
05:40:48,080 --> 05:40:56,240
that way queen has to be played so what wild card a king and just do a double single king

2809
05:40:56,240 --> 05:41:02,480
oh wait no hold on two pair is stronger than a pair a flush is way stronger though

2810
05:41:04,400 --> 05:41:11,760
you can also just discard it or discard it has to be played or discarded wait hold on let the

2811
05:41:11,760 --> 05:41:17,760
reeflings think right let me just add a load of shit because this is going to add to our multiplier

2812
05:41:17,760 --> 05:41:25,600
enhance two selected cards to multi cards whoa that's actually really big 10% messing around

2813
05:41:27,360 --> 05:41:32,720
I can do well this turn it to a pair is not going to turn it to a pair

2814
05:41:33,440 --> 05:41:42,480
king king queen six six do you want king let me activate the lover's card on this

2815
05:41:43,040 --> 05:41:50,240
wait why do you know what enhance one selected card into a wild card why did that not work

2816
05:41:51,600 --> 05:41:54,480
wait oh wait it was going to do it to the queen

2817
05:41:55,440 --> 05:42:01,360
oh I mean it's going to put my multiplier up anyway

2818
05:42:04,000 --> 05:42:06,720
yeah so that didn't really do anything that's fine

2819
05:42:07,680 --> 05:42:14,880
your queen is forced to be selected empress will affect it okay we don't want that then so king king

2820
05:42:15,440 --> 05:42:26,320
nine nine because I've got an odd number king king nine nine double will activate spear trousers

2821
05:42:26,320 --> 05:42:35,120
odd will activate on the nine um nodders yeah yeah okay we've got agreements let's see what number

2822
05:42:35,120 --> 05:42:40,880
are we gonna pull are we gonna win oh my god we might win

2823
05:42:44,640 --> 05:42:51,120
six five wait six seven eight nine five

2824
05:42:53,840 --> 05:43:00,480
and I can shove some mullies on it too while I'm at it why not why not why not I think we've won

2825
05:43:01,360 --> 05:43:12,960
I think we've won nine eight seven six five I think we've done it we won virtual we actually did it

2828
05:43:38,000 --> 05:43:42,080

2864
05:47:53,760 --> 05:48:03,680
dollars as well right we're gonna do a reroll oh come on come on give it no right okay we're at 35

2865
05:48:03,680 --> 05:48:15,600
though wheel of fortune let's go no what we use it three times technically right one more reroll

2866
05:48:17,040 --> 05:48:22,560
what we got net chin one and two card to create a tarot when a booster pack is open

2867
05:48:23,680 --> 05:48:29,280
I've tried it three times create a tarot card if the poker hand contains an ace or a straight

2868
05:48:29,280 --> 05:48:33,040
brah we'd be tarotting out the wazoo but I don't know what I would give up for that

2869
05:48:33,040 --> 05:48:37,280
things about I mean hold on

2870
05:48:41,120 --> 05:48:47,840
hold on odd Todd in exchange for create a tarot card which is going to constantly bounce off

2871
05:48:47,840 --> 05:48:56,320
of fortune tellers cheeks huh it's something to consider

2872
05:49:01,200 --> 05:49:07,680
it's too late for polarity you think it's too late it's too late and an abstract one okay okay

2873
05:49:08,640 --> 05:49:12,560
I do not have enough for another reroll I want to maximize that income okay it's too late I will

2874
05:49:12,560 --> 05:49:17,760
okay thank you thank you thank you I am I am learning give us one dollar played hand I get 54

2875
05:49:17,760 --> 05:49:26,640
bucks for skipping this wait that's worth it then but it skips the shop but it's 54 bucks

2876
05:49:28,400 --> 05:49:30,960
playing a two pair sets money to zero

2877
05:49:34,080 --> 05:49:36,320
all face cards are drawn face down

2878
05:49:36,400 --> 05:49:41,920
yeah we definitely didn't oh no

2879
05:49:45,360 --> 05:49:47,360
is that a mistake possibly

2880
05:49:49,760 --> 05:49:52,720
54 bucks to skip but I need to buy stuff

2881
05:49:53,440 --> 05:49:57,280
polarity is cool when you delete your middle cards and just get tarts over hand

2882
05:49:58,960 --> 05:50:05,040
I think I'd do it for 54 bucks but we don't get access to the shop so if we mess up like this is it

2883
05:50:05,600 --> 05:50:09,360
strongy you're endless every round we'll get higher and higher until you break

2884
05:50:09,360 --> 05:50:16,800
until I break we're here to break the game if I get if I can mess around with 54 bucks so that's so big

2885
05:50:20,080 --> 05:50:22,720
enough fuck it

2886
05:50:24,560 --> 05:50:30,080
fuck it 103 have we even had 103 on our persons before

2887
05:50:30,240 --> 05:50:35,200
right face down face cards are drawn down

2888
05:50:37,680 --> 05:50:39,680
hmm

2889
05:50:41,760 --> 05:50:45,680
10 9 10 9 8 7 6 5

2890
05:50:51,200 --> 05:50:53,440
this will be a flush guaranteed but we will

2891
05:50:54,240 --> 05:50:59,040
subs we will forfeit a tarot card if I do it

2892
05:51:10,000 --> 05:51:15,200
not bad not bad oh this is getting a bit tricky though

2893
05:51:17,200 --> 05:51:22,480
so these are all high so really I'm just going for a double up here high

2894
05:51:24,000 --> 05:51:27,040
I don't really have a choice in the matter

2895
05:51:29,200 --> 05:51:36,560
I don't really want to I want to keep you yeah this is the best I can do considering discard

2896
05:51:36,560 --> 05:51:44,800
the face cards maybe dig for straights maybe just delete them it's just because we know they're high

2897
05:51:44,800 --> 05:51:48,960
so there's the odds are there's likely a singular pair in here

2898
05:51:49,360 --> 05:51:59,120
hmm but you're right though I could maybe get a straight low straight

2899
05:52:02,240 --> 05:52:09,120
how many how many rounds I've already done one fourth of it but I have four hands left if I

2900
05:52:09,120 --> 05:52:15,360
fuck this up it's just the likelihood of these being high or a pair is pretty decent

2901
05:52:16,240 --> 05:52:24,480
and oh shit wait maybe not no wait you guys are right holy shit you're right

2902
05:52:26,960 --> 05:52:30,000
10 9 8 7 6 5

2903
05:52:31,920 --> 05:52:34,880
yeah and then there'll be a multiplier because of what's on my hand

2904
05:52:35,840 --> 05:52:40,320
no that was the correct choice thank you guys thank you for letting me think a little bit there

2905
05:52:40,320 --> 05:52:46,080
uh ace

2906
05:52:50,720 --> 05:52:55,120
if there's not a queen in here we can't do a straight from here

2907
05:52:57,440 --> 05:52:59,040
we might be able to do a straight

2908
05:53:02,960 --> 05:53:08,960
or do we just play a singular ace what happens if it's a king

2909
05:53:10,320 --> 05:53:15,120
we don't make it what happens if it's a queen then we make it

2910
05:53:17,120 --> 05:53:18,800
it's a jack a queen or a king

2911
05:53:21,280 --> 05:53:22,800
you still have three hands

2912
05:53:25,920 --> 05:53:33,360
fuck it I'm here for the gamble we already won we already won so we can gamble like crazy

2913
05:53:34,320 --> 05:53:40,080
we already won so we can do these silly silly actions that no one should do at home

2914
05:53:40,880 --> 05:53:46,960
uh well a double four clear it I think it will yeah a double four will clear it no problem

2915
05:53:49,760 --> 05:53:53,280
oh I fish my smart smart smart fish smart fish

2916
05:53:55,680 --> 05:53:58,160
16 bucks the money's getting lesser

2917
05:53:58,400 --> 05:54:01,760
oh don't mind if I do

2918
05:54:04,560 --> 05:54:09,920
uh urinus also levels up what's this permanently add a discard for each one

2919
05:54:10,480 --> 05:54:14,560
it's pretty good I'll add a permanent discount

2920
05:54:15,360 --> 05:54:20,240
because that'll help out I've got a voucher unlocked even more I must be like steam sale

2921
05:54:20,240 --> 05:54:25,680
tarot cards let's go I'm over 100 gold I'm just that good right

2922
05:54:26,240 --> 05:54:33,680
planet glass stone planet planet no doubt four of a kind and a high card I mean

2923
05:54:37,200 --> 05:54:42,960
I'm just level everything up high card a joker card I don't need so we're gonna do a re-roll

2924
05:54:44,560 --> 05:54:50,320
a full house and a flush sure I'm quite happy there are only two dollars as well to buy like

2925
05:54:50,400 --> 05:54:54,080
upgrade the base of everything so I honestly don't mind

2926
05:54:55,280 --> 05:55:00,880
uh currently 18 joker well you are not gonna out oh you might outplay Todd

2927
05:55:05,040 --> 05:55:09,520
uh odd Todd your time is starting to look up I'm not gonna lie

2928
05:55:11,680 --> 05:55:20,240
50 chips 31 chips or 18 multiplier uh yeah I think it's time odd Todd

2929
05:55:20,400 --> 05:55:26,320
you have done fantastic we are appreciative of your services but you simply have just been

2930
05:55:26,320 --> 05:55:32,000
outplayed uh we will have you at the back I don't think it matters if you're at the back

2931
05:55:32,000 --> 05:55:36,560
thank you odd Todd for your service abstract joker welcome in we've not had you before so please

2932
05:55:36,560 --> 05:55:45,440

2933
05:55:45,440 --> 05:55:51,120
the back how do you know where to put it in the bank I hope I didn't miss mess up there right when

2934
05:55:51,120 --> 05:56:01,600
we roll whoa why did you make that played face cards add odd Todd helps a lot rip run and before

2935
05:56:01,600 --> 05:56:09,120
we lose this because I got rid of we odd Todd 80 chips if hand contains a flush not that good

2936
05:56:09,200 --> 05:56:12,000
adds the number of times poker hands has been played

2937
05:56:14,480 --> 05:56:20,080
adds the number of times poker hands has been played to this run to the multi

2938
05:56:27,280 --> 05:56:31,200
that's fine a million

2939
05:56:31,440 --> 05:56:35,280
a million

2940
05:56:44,240 --> 05:56:48,640
endless is that yeah that's just I mean I knew we weren't gonna like infinitely win

2941
05:56:50,160 --> 05:56:53,520
well re-roll sure I'll take a full swing

2942
05:56:55,200 --> 05:57:00,720
Zach thank you for coming to member I appreciate it we are about to jump into the ASMR member

2943
05:57:00,720 --> 05:57:05,280
stream slightly late for it don't worry about it guys and we are about to redirect into none other

2944
05:57:05,280 --> 05:57:14,400
than a Zeridule who is doing ASMR so please do enjoy her uh to your full capacity straight flush

2945
05:57:14,400 --> 05:57:20,080
I don't want to go straight flushed off me little all right we can do one more

2946
05:57:24,240 --> 05:57:34,960
uh yes and yes to use well because we will utilize you okay next round

2947
05:57:37,120 --> 05:57:41,920
let's go all right what do you do select two cards give out the left card into the right

2948
05:57:42,880 --> 05:57:46,960
I would like to actually upgrade our doubles

2949
05:57:54,160 --> 05:57:57,360
because we're not really doing it

2950
05:58:02,640 --> 05:58:03,200
oh no

2951
05:58:06,400 --> 05:58:09,680
that may have been a mistake I'm gonna be honest that may have been a mistake

2952
05:58:10,560 --> 05:58:13,600
queen jack 10 no I don't have to flush at all

2953
05:58:16,000 --> 05:58:24,240
ooh I might mess up there make another steal ooh I like that idea select two cards that convert

2954
05:58:24,240 --> 05:58:36,880
the left card into the right one so two steals okay now I have to get riddles

2955
05:58:39,760 --> 05:58:47,120
I couldn't theory if we're going for a flush get rid of the jewel jack because we can jump over him

2956
05:58:47,840 --> 05:58:48,800
and vice versa

2957
05:58:51,760 --> 05:58:57,520
uh we can jump over the jack at any point so he's not really necessarily needed

2958
05:59:00,240 --> 05:59:04,720
or I could just get a steel jack you know your choice

2959
05:59:04,720 --> 05:59:11,360
oh no this is oh no this can't be I'm doing shit

2960
05:59:17,360 --> 05:59:22,720
wait am I a freaking idiot can I not jump allow straights to be made with gaps in one rank yeah

2961
05:59:22,720 --> 05:59:29,120
so I can still do the jump ace marison yes I'm about to lose this round I'm not even joking and I

2962
05:59:29,120 --> 05:59:34,640
I don't have any shred of hope I've completely balls this up and yeah I can still jump

2963
05:59:36,000 --> 05:59:39,120
yeah I knew I could still jump I've got a shortcut and 10

2964
05:59:44,480 --> 05:59:46,800
losing not good no not good at all but

2965
05:59:49,120 --> 05:59:53,920
we'll survive ish I don't even know what to play

2966
05:59:53,920 --> 06:00:00,320
hey the multiplier is so good but I have like nothing I can play

2967
06:00:02,400 --> 06:00:05,680
king queen 10 and then nothing

2968
06:00:07,760 --> 06:00:17,120
oh what do I do what do you recommend discard and fish for something better I'm gonna have to

2969
06:00:17,840 --> 06:00:19,360
right queen I can discard

2970
06:00:22,000 --> 06:00:26,800
I don't want to discard like these guys because they all give me a multiplier

2971
06:00:28,240 --> 06:00:32,560
oh but I'm gonna have to wait that plays a pair apparently oh yeah it does

2972
06:00:34,800 --> 06:00:40,560
I mean I only have four I can't throw it away

2973
06:00:42,000 --> 06:00:44,880
well I can't throw away that's what I'm gonna do I need to go for a flush

2974
06:00:44,880 --> 06:00:46,880
oh

2975
06:00:51,760 --> 06:00:55,120
king queen jack 10 9 8 oh

2976
06:00:58,240 --> 06:01:03,840
all right we're gonna have to just go for double vase 2 9

2977
06:01:04,560 --> 06:01:04,960
I mean

2978
06:01:09,440 --> 06:01:15,120
my luck is perishing guys I've used all my luck the game really said go redirect into

2979
06:01:15,120 --> 06:01:21,040
a zero right now I mean it's not too bad you're right it's not too bad let's give a shot what's

2980
06:01:21,040 --> 06:01:21,680
going on here

2981
06:01:25,040 --> 06:01:26,000
no I've not got it

2982
06:01:26,240 --> 06:01:35,760
I mean I can do a full house here but I've not got it

2983
06:01:39,280 --> 06:01:45,040
oh I think it's ogre won't be a lose if you redirect or should I just redirect

2984
06:01:45,040 --> 06:01:47,600
and end the stream and be like oh I won by the way wink wink

2985
06:01:50,240 --> 06:01:52,960
this scaling and endless most is insane

2986
06:01:53,920 --> 06:01:56,400
ah well we'll just play what we've got I know

2987
06:01:59,920 --> 06:02:05,760
yeah now we've already lost the first endless holy crap right six five four three and I can't

2988
06:02:05,760 --> 06:02:12,880
do anything wow that got like hard out in nowhere like so hard right we're just gonna

2989
06:02:12,880 --> 06:02:18,800
we're not gonna win so there's no point in like trying to freaking go nuts with the math behind

2990
06:02:18,800 --> 06:02:26,480
the game we don't have it right king jack 10 9 8 okay well don't have an 8 so we'll roll for an 8

2991
06:02:31,760 --> 06:02:40,960
we'll roll for an 8 yeah king jack 10 9 8 that's the best we can do with both clubs

2992
06:02:41,520 --> 06:02:49,440
no biggie we tried we tried our besties that wasn't bad that got insanely hard though like

2993
06:02:49,440 --> 06:02:54,480
instantly insanely hard I am very interested in trying to win with all the other decks though

2994
06:02:56,880 --> 06:03:02,880
pardon me sorry oh we unlocked a few things when I run without playing four of a kind oops

2995
06:03:04,960 --> 06:03:09,920
well considering I didn't get it why would you give me that as a card when I run without playing a

2996
06:03:09,920 --> 06:03:17,280
flush I mean that's really not that hard and then when I run copies the ability of the joker to the

2997
06:03:17,280 --> 06:03:26,320
right oh that would be a very interesting card nebula deck unlocked when um start run with the

2998
06:03:26,320 --> 06:03:35,120
telescope voucher and one consumable slot tell celestial pack always contain a planet card for

2999
06:03:35,120 --> 06:03:43,840
your most played poker hand wow that's an interesting element redeem at least 10 voucher cards in one

3000
06:03:43,840 --> 06:03:50,000
run all cards and packs are 50 off I thought that when I saw that I popped up on the side

3001
06:03:50,000 --> 06:04:01,840
um planet cards in your consumable area give 1.5 multi for this one

3002
06:04:03,920 --> 06:04:08,480
use a total of 25 planet cards from any pack I use 33 in that run flow

3003
06:04:10,560 --> 06:04:18,160
use a total of 25 tarot cards from any arena spectral cards may appear in any of the oh so

3004
06:04:18,160 --> 06:04:25,200
it's like bonus cards now I like that I love games that like level up and get easier or unlock more

3005
06:04:25,200 --> 06:04:30,320
unique stuff as time goes on like that's why I really like binding of Isaac three times multi on

3006
06:04:30,320 --> 06:04:41,920
final hand of a round play 200 hands well there it is balatro not to be diffused with more pro

wait what bit of battle did you enjoy the most since the experience is fresh what did I enjoy the most

3024
06:06:53,760 --> 06:07:03,520
I think I enjoy discovering new cards and seeing how they all interact like that that new

3025
06:07:03,520 --> 06:07:08,800
straight mechanic being like oh you can skip a straight I'm like what do you mean you can skip

3026
06:07:08,800 --> 06:07:15,600
that's crazy like that was very fun to discover and you guys like telling me like what you think

3027
06:07:15,600 --> 06:07:21,600
is the best play and then like I'll say like oh actually I felt like that Joker card you know

3028
06:07:21,600 --> 06:07:26,560
we can do this we can do that and I quite like that I like the input I can do in this kind of game

3029
06:07:26,560 --> 06:07:31,200
as well like I like when you guys can like tell me what to do and be like right we're in this

3030
06:07:31,200 --> 06:07:35,520
together like it's us against the game you know it's not like it's not just me playing the game

3031
06:07:35,520 --> 06:07:40,640
it's like all of us are like come on like as I said we would definitely be kicked out the casino

3032
06:07:40,640 --> 06:07:44,560
by now because it's just me holding cards and then looking you all in the eyes like yeah

3033
06:07:44,560 --> 06:07:49,040
does everyone agree and then everyone gives me a nod and then I play it like we'd be kicked out so

3034
06:07:49,120 --> 06:07:50,160

vtuber showcase look at this video and tell me this isn't that shit insane is this video was so

3045
06:09:04,480 --> 06:09:11,040
impactful I have yet to forget about it um some of you might recognize it because they got recommended

3046
06:09:11,360 --> 06:09:15,840
actually that reminds me nari wanted me to do a model showcase and she hasn't told me what she

3047
06:09:15,840 --> 06:09:23,120
wants me to make of the models which I should have a wee look at that I put a link in chat right now

haha four hours no way it's been six hours oh my god I was supposed to like be finished my eighth

3049
06:09:32,560 --> 06:09:44,320
of ASMR by now um yes you might recognize that showcase because it did not leave my head

3050
06:09:44,960 --> 06:09:51,200
we could see mama's brain expanding in real time yeah her hypnosis powers only grow stronger with

3051
06:09:51,200 --> 06:09:55,040
time oh thank you phoenix for the tip I'm getting so big brains

3052
06:09:55,440 --> 06:10:01,440
that can you tell in my voice when I'm thinking but yes if anyone's

3053
06:10:01,440 --> 06:10:08,560
wanting a casino girl honestly I quite like moxie's design from what's her what's that

3054
06:10:08,560 --> 06:10:12,880
franchise called oh my god we're claptrap and everything borderlands moxie borderlands

3055
06:10:13,760 --> 06:10:23,680
I preferred moxie's borderlands what design was it moxie borderlands three design question mark

3056
06:10:23,760 --> 06:10:25,120
was that the one I like the most

3057
06:10:29,440 --> 06:10:33,040
I honestly wouldn't mind a cute hat on someone

3058
06:10:35,040 --> 06:10:39,040
I'm down for a cute hat on someone I don't know who but someone

3059
06:10:40,720 --> 06:10:45,200
my delay is bad enough I watched the whole video before she mentioned it in the video oh no

3060
06:10:47,280 --> 06:10:52,240
I don't know why some of my streams have been on lowly uh on high normal latency and I've had to

3061
06:10:52,240 --> 06:10:55,040
manually put it back to low latency so there isn't a delay

3062
06:10:58,000 --> 06:11:04,160
right now I'm playing borderlands three I'm gonna uh for my birthday in October

3063
06:11:05,040 --> 06:11:09,280
I'm gonna see if I can wrangle some v-tubers to play borderlands two campaign with me

3064
06:11:10,000 --> 06:11:18,320
uh I'd like to do that for me birthday um problem is endurance streamers although saying that she

3065
06:11:18,320 --> 06:11:23,040
be done an endurance stream and so has Azura um

3066
06:11:26,720 --> 06:11:31,440
uh I might have made a new a new friend a new um

3067
06:11:34,080 --> 06:11:37,920
what do you call it when it's a professional relationship like because we both work in the

3068
06:11:37,920 --> 06:11:44,400
same job is that the terminology I may have made a new thingy it might be interesting possibly I

3069
06:11:44,400 --> 06:11:50,800
could grab one chick from a v-tuber agency in different agencies and do a borderlands thing

3070
06:11:50,800 --> 06:11:56,560
and it'll be like a four-way agency collab oh wow but you know only with people I vibe with because

3071
06:11:56,560 --> 06:12:02,400
yeah uh business part yeah business relationship yeah that's pretty much my man and

3072
06:12:04,160 --> 06:12:08,960
my main fact in the girls are endurance streaming we are so back literally I was so surprised Azura

3073
06:12:08,960 --> 06:12:18,240
did like insane on a stardew valley apparently she has like thousands of hours in it and I'm like

3074
06:12:20,240 --> 06:12:26,880
the game I have the most hours in is black ops one and then black ops two and then probably

3075
06:12:26,880 --> 06:12:34,240
overwatch and then dead by daylight and then it just kind of gets scattered around the place from

3076
06:12:34,800 --> 06:12:40,960
the 4k on stardew is she like a hundred percent of that stuff I think Isaac has most I think I

3077
06:12:40,960 --> 06:12:47,840
uh I cleared like I think I'm just shy of 500 hours in Isaac how many hours in dead by daylight

3078
06:12:47,840 --> 06:12:55,840
I was a very early player of dead by daylight I've probably got 1.5 thousand hours in dead by

3079
06:12:55,840 --> 06:13:00,880
daylight I was an early dead by daylight player I am not familiar with anything do not ask me the

3080
06:13:00,960 --> 06:13:08,320
question of anything uh in the recent updates I was gone a long time ago in that game um

3081
06:13:10,160 --> 06:13:17,600
wait did I say the number right yeah I probably got like 4,000 in cards and then overwatch would be

3082
06:13:17,600 --> 06:13:27,760
like 2,000 dead by daylight 1,000.5 like oh when I get into a game I get into a game like I'm only

3083
06:13:27,760 --> 06:13:32,320
at 700 just watch vods in two times speed yeah that's how you keep up with my content I was like

3084
06:13:32,320 --> 06:13:37,760
how am I supposed to keep up with your content if Azura has done a stardew stream into the 12 hour

3085
06:13:37,760 --> 06:13:43,440
mark of the day she she would actually have you beaten off well if youtube would fix their

3086
06:13:43,440 --> 06:13:52,480
vod issue then I'd be streaming a heck of a lot longer 4k and black ops one uh yeah most likely

3087
06:13:52,480 --> 06:14:01,280
on that one alone um I was very isolated as a child and played black ops one all day long

3088
06:14:01,920 --> 06:14:08,640
and I was having problems like going to school and all that had issues oh boo I'm gonna eat my

3089
06:14:08,640 --> 06:14:13,680
my protein ball so my stomach isn't rumbling too much during the ASMR um

3090
06:14:15,840 --> 06:14:20,960
2k and rims world ooh what's your guys' biggest game I have a next two weeks off of vacation

3091
06:14:20,960 --> 06:14:23,920
might be able to catch up with Tony's vods by then good luck

3092
06:14:28,400 --> 06:14:32,720
pretty strong you feel hot oh well we're in the good times now we flin don't worry about

3093
06:14:34,080 --> 06:14:40,800
yeah I'm basically used to sit and play xbox all day because um my parents were like super

3094
06:14:40,800 --> 06:14:49,040
understanding with the whole school situation um and having issues so I just kind of got left

3095
06:14:49,440 --> 06:14:59,360
to my xbox and that's why I play a lot of xbox games dominions what's dominions five dominions

3096
06:14:59,360 --> 06:15:04,640
five I haven't even heard of dominions one what kind of underground games are you guys playing

3097
06:15:07,600 --> 06:15:10,400
mama and papa cuttles are best yeah

3098
06:15:11,280 --> 06:15:15,120

3099
06:15:17,600 --> 06:15:24,160
this protein peanut butter ball is shit I cast mend but crack it's that bad

3100
06:15:25,520 --> 06:15:29,040
probably dead by daylight with 3000 black ops mentioned one on five

3101
06:15:31,760 --> 06:15:32,800
oh no that's not one with five

3102
06:15:33,760 --> 06:15:35,600
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

3103
06:15:35,600 --> 06:15:39,280
not one 7k and destiny

3104
06:15:40,880 --> 06:15:47,840
yeah damn did you play kod zombie no I was terrified of kod zombies I still am I find it terrifying

3105
06:15:49,760 --> 06:15:58,560
I wish there was an end the reason why I thoroughly enjoyed college or a ghost alien mode is because

3106
06:15:58,560 --> 06:16:03,660
there was an end you can you can either win the game mode or you can die to the

3107
06:16:03,660 --> 06:16:08,360
aliens in the game mode which is why I adored it had an end games that are like

3108
06:16:08,360 --> 06:16:12,720
infinite replayability but doesn't give you some sort of closure or ending I

3109
06:16:12,720 --> 06:16:18,040
didn't like it so when like cod zombies keeps going that's not really for me

3110
06:16:18,040 --> 06:16:23,600
although I'm sure there's a new zombie game out that's supposed to rival cod

3111
06:16:23,600 --> 06:16:31,040
zombies kind of game mode completely forgotten the name of the game though

3112
06:16:31,040 --> 06:16:36,360
20k hours in world of warcraft yeah damn your ERP and in Goldshire a little

3113
06:16:36,360 --> 06:16:42,680

3116
06:16:55,720 --> 06:17:01,320

3117
06:17:01,320 --> 06:17:05,760
everyone heels and you go yeah that's me because it was like you use your voice

3118
06:17:05,760 --> 06:17:15,720
