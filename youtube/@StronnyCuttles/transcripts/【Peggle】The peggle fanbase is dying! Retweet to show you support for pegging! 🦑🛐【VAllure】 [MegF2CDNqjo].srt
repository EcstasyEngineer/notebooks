1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,780
I move it a little bit, do it a little bit, no stop, no we've just got nausea, we're

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,780
doing good.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,980
Just nausea, literally shaking right now mommy please hold the line, it's when he was here

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:37,980
no she has abandoned, reflin, reflin food, my burp, my chunder, oh now he's a perplexed

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,540
man I'm getting, I'm getting shaky I'm getting nervous, what, I don't understand that last

6
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:51,940
remark, I don't get it, I've never felt such sadness, no you're fine, it's fine, good morning

7
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:58,900
good evening, good afternoon, can you hear me? Hi mommy, hi reflin, you're okay, everything's

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,900
fine, okay.

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:08,700
Turns out Peggle is a stupidly old game that I had no concept of, the dang thing was they

10
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:18,060
tried to load the neverhin, put it this way, the game that you see on stream is bigger

11
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,700
than what I can actually see, it's locked into this tiny little fucking box that I can't

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,340
see anything with, so I'm gonna be playing through OBS pretty much is what's gonna happen

13
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,620
and this game is so old, it didn't even let you touch the main menu options, it just threw

14
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,860
me into tutorial mode and I'm like no, I haven't even started streaming yet, it literally

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:52,020
threw me in, the lego lord of the rings vods got fucking annihilated by copyright, like

16
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:01,340
if nothing happens I'm happy to put them up later, when I say annihilated you say huh,

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,380
like no it's fine, my 17 hours of streams, I didn't want them up anyway, absolutely everything

18
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:18,220
has been, any song from the franchise has been decimated, like the two of them had been

19
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,820
completely blocked from a ton of countries and I'm like oh my god is this gonna affect

20
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,660
my channel, so what I've done, I've privated them, if nothing seems to happen I will put

21
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,940
them back up at a later date but right now I'm a bit cautious cause like that's the worst

22
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:44,580
I've ever seen anything on my channel so far, no don't vomit, those are good streams, yeah

23
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:52,700
like I think I ended streaming and it looked fine, it all looked fine and then I think

24
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,140
I refreshed the page or whatever cause I was just checking the comments cause we were

25
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,540
improving the burp comments cause they're the big nasty burp in the middle of one of

26
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:05,940
the streams and all I get is notification notification notification, I'm like oh my god what's

27
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,140
going on and then like that's when it all registered that like everything had been annihilated

28
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,020
to Kingdom coming back so yeah thanks YouTube, didn't want my 17 hours of stream up anyway,

29
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:23,140
no, five minutes ago I thought staying up to 8am was a bad idea, irresponsible, take

30
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,300
a minute for the audio jungle cause I'm worried about being nuked up where I need to get coffee

31
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:40,180
right bro, hopefully, but yes today's stream is peggle, please don't forget to leave a

32
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:48,300
like for the pegging community is dying, this game is old, I didn't realise how old

33
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,860
it was, I don't remember, I just remember playing the trial on xbox and cause I didn't

34
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,540
I used to play the trials cause I didn't have any money and I had to ask my dad for the

35
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:12,700
game so I got to play trials of things all the time and as I said if nothing happens

36
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,260
with the Lord of the Rings boards like nothing seems to be imperative then I'm happy to just

37
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,180
fart them back up again but I'm a bit nervous at this point in time cause the sea of red

38
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:32,500
on it is crazy, yeah but all enter will fill screen the game for you, ah I mean as long

39
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,060
as you can see that's the main thing, it doesn't really matter if I can see bro, I just need

40
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,300
my light to rubber up at them, but yes we're gonna play peggle, we're just gonna muck

41
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,340
around, I don't know how loud the game's gonna be so do forgive me, if it's not that good

42
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,660
and then afterwards I'm gonna need about 5 minutes to set up my hand cam membership

43
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:00,900
ASMR, um yeah and he said the webcam up for that and my desk is a mess as always, actually

44
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:11,940
you know what, no no no all F4s, oh yeah sure, I believe ya, I believe ya, um yeah I've got

45
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,900
um, I know I said the next membership ASMR was gonna be 1000 kisses before I can talk

46
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,060
but I can't do it for the current one that I'm planning because I need to show you the

47
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,220
item and we're gonna test it and if you guys think it's good then we'll do a public stream

48
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,180
with it and if it's rubbish then it'll be forever or, honestly I'm gonna get peh, hi

49
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,180
momay, hi son, hi replay, good morning, good evening, good afternoon, sorry if I sound

50
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:48,820
tired, yeah it turns out tryharding on lego lord of the rings for 13 hours in one day,

51
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,460
I don't know, it's a little bit, I hate to say, I hate to be that streamer that's like

52
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,340
you know what that took it out of me, but again be some credit, that was a 13 hour stream

53
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,460
it took it out of me, I couldn't sleep and I've been having a dull tummy ache and I'm

54
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,940
like how did I get rid of this and before anyone goes ketchup season, I'm sure you

55
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,940
have had many a ketchup in many a season, I know the difference between the pain of

56
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:22,740
ketchup season and a dull tummy ache, 13 hours, so we broke the board and then I had to make

57
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,900
another like 30 minute private thing, so I technically did go over the 12 hour mark

58
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:36,780
into the 13 if you can read the name, hello hi replay, I've never played half life, no

59
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,820
everyone was mental for it though so maybe I should, for those of you who weren't able

60
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:50,420
to see the vlog, again it was copyright issues, but I finished it and I got a sugar ton of

61
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,820
gifted memberships so you can already see there's a new emoteslot unlocked before I've

62
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,060
even ordered the next batch, technically people get it, sometimes sitting for a long time

63
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,020
does give a bit of a tiny time to be seen, yeah I'm not really sure, ketchup season took

64
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:13,140
me a second, well I see this was one of the things you guys taught me, I didn't know if

65
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,260
a VTuber says they have a slow tummy, sometimes that's codeword for ketchup season and I

66
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,260
said it many months ago, I was like oh my stomach kinda hurts and like folk were like

67
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,980
oh my god it's her ketchup season, I'm like no I've never talked about that, no relax,

68
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:41,380
and then I got taught about that and I was like oh that's not any of that mean, a little

69
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:49,060
ketchup fact, no she's pregnant, no that's October, such a broad term it could mean anything,

70
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,500
but literally what we're saying, don't worry guys she says this is when she is ketchup season

71
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,860
and no need to hit, shark wait, now I'm a cuttlefish, I don't like sharks, they eat me,

72
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:08,820
nine minutes it's over, the tea got her, my tea is actually warm, I strategically made the tea

73
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,660
later than I usually do, so you're just, I'm sorry you're just forced to talk to me, oh I can't

74
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:22,260
believe it, I'm gonna open up Marshmallow, they're just forced to talk to me, regarding the void,

75
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,980
Archive Brewers managed to grab the first, you need me to unprivate the last one,

76
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,020
mommy wait wait eight minutes ago, mommy where are you, I'm gonna throw up, I must have literally

77
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:46,740
been clicking go live as you typed that, you good boy, I'm Ethan, I can do 120 push-ups,

78
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:54,020
yeah you know what I can do, sleep like a cat for eight hours, bagel hardly even know her, okay,

79
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:02,820
apologies if I sent this so I saw you fine, um table top stimulator, yes I'm afraid I don't know

80
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,060
how to use it though, but I think I have it, but it's a good six man game, yeah, um,

81
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,980
Johnny I just want to say as a fan I think you did a good job, oh well I'm not allowed to upgrade

82
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:25,620
you to refund status, no, I've got mild tummy, it could be a baguette, ketchup wheat, a bastard,

83
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,620
oh no I managed to bake a loaf of bread, I repeat a loaf of bread has been baked so I feel fine in

84
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:43,300
that department again, um, some banjo feedback, no considering I've not even streamed on it yet,

85
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,460
you're a bit too early on the feedback for me Reefland, what the fuck I ain't even streamed yet,

86
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,380
that's funny, sorry I couldn't say it for the last time, don't worry about it Reefland, those

87
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,500
streams are ridiculous, love you, I love you too Reefland, please don't worry, again my voice is

88
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,820
probably just I'm very tired, I promise I'm here and I'm happy and I'm bintzining, hot pen streamers

89
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:19,140
who shitted, what is the agendation for tomorrow, I know I have a collab coming up, I need to make sure,

90
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:26,100
oh it's tomorrow, bleat I need to learn how to play dead by daylight, bleat it's tomorrow,

91
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:37,700
can't let the girls down, okay, how can we know when you'll stream on the other site, um, I,

92
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,700
you are better putting your stonks into the other girls right now, I am fucking swapping so many

93
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:51,460
hats right now, like right now my job is to catch up on my own work and open up the established

94
00:10:51,460 --> 00:11:00,340
clipper program for vealer, um, I'm afraid I don't even have the ability to feel anything when I,

95
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,300
when the bean has stopped, there's no other way to say it, I have like no, I have negative

96
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:15,700
riz against it right now, um, it's just awful, it's like the gate, it's like the great stories

97
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:22,100
Mr Frodo, the ones that really mattered, full of darkness and danger they were, and sometimes you

98
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,540
didn't want to know the end because how could the end be happy, how could the world go back

99
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,940
to the way it was when so much bad has happened, but in the end it was only a passing thing this

100
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:41,220
shadow, even darkness must pass, a new day will come and when the sun shines it'll shine out the

101
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:48,740
clear, I know now folks in these stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't,

102
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,620
we kept going because we were holding on to something that there's some good in this world,

103
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:04,180
Mr Frodo, and it's worth fighting, so thank you, I like that one very much, the vault, the timer on

104
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,260
the vault door is ticking with the fuck we're playing Fallout 1 need to get that fucking water

105
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:14,020
chip or something, please tell me this is from memory, you hilarious, no I was reading, no chance,

106
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,500
right will we pegglers, oh wait no I've not had my tea yet that's why I'm talking,

107
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,380
sorry this is why I do a pre-yap, it's to drink the tea while it's warm, okay let's test it out,

108
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,540
oh I got a review on my Patreon audio, are you ready?

109
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,820
fucking hell cuttles, that grooving audio is too good, you really let loose through the sass,

110
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:44,420
the sarcasm and the anger, then with a mix of sections where you're enjoying yourself just,

111
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:53,060
I was desperately holding back the urge to grab my torch and jackhammer that whole,

112
00:12:53,060 --> 00:13:00,820
like how I think about jackhammering yours, why didn't you? I hear you say, it's because it's late

113
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,260
and the neighbours are all up and they'd hear me pounding it as a grunt moaning panter name

114
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:14,660
while recording an audio for you, pregnant via your rear, you didn't even know how much of an ink dump

115
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,900
I'd turn you into by trying, I gave me something wet mess on holy juices dripping on every muscle

116
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,820
twitch, wet every muscle twitch and aftermath that would be make a demon to blush as they walked in,

117
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,700
damn women why do you drive me so fucking barrel at times, why the accent, oh this

118
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,380
because the AI can't pick up my heavy Scottish accent so I can see what I want when I'm a heavy

119
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:47,460
Scottish and when I'm really heavy Scottish you should check out the closed captions, it doesn't

120
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:54,260
have a fucking clue what I'm on about half the time, but until the Scottish patch comes to AI

121
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:03,540
I'm gonna abuse the fuck out of that, thank you for the audio reviews if you guys ever send me

122
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,420
them, I fucking love them especially like when it comes to the me or Mimsa, that is the most

123
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,220
change in my life Scottish buffy, five head play, are you'll be pegging, yeah we're gonna peg in

124
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:23,220
two minutes once I finish my tea, can you unlock comments on Patreon, because I do not have the

125
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,740
time, resources nor want to spend money on a team that would remove negative comments for myself

126
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:36,420
or any of the girls so the only way to give feedback is via Marshmallows, on the topic of

127
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:44,900
Patreon feedback you're always welcome to message me if there's some things going on with your girl

128
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,340
because I tell the script master, like myself and the script master in communication the girls

129
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,580
just fill the scripts okay so don't if you're like really not vibing what the pic was this month

130
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:06,980
you're more than happy to give feedback we try to do what we do is a we cast the net okay

131
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,980
now it's impossible that everything produced by one single content creator you're gonna love

132
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,940
you're gonna adore it's gonna be perfect you're gonna eat it up that's not possible so let's

133
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,820
you know just start with that in the conversation and two again the girls do the scripts they are

134
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:32,260
provided them unless the girls um I did see some of them potentially right in their some scripts even

135
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:41,700
if it was a one-off here and there with their respective um mascot name um so you might have

136
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:49,780
more personal things like that but as as a overall thing um is Halo CE live going to be story mode

137
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:56,820
or the multiplayer um the story mode the one where the and he like crash lands and he's the only

138
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:05,300
survivor because he's like me it was so good it made me and the beginning was really happening for

139
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,620

146
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,780
on the same wavelength about everything so fucking you'd stream with one of us one day

147
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,060
and then the night and the other one would be offline like ed and asmr and shiz nice and easy

148
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:13,700
and retweet how big is your cup oh it's just a regular size cup not the skinny ones for like

older people you know how like the elderly kind of have like a weak appetite uh no mine's like a

150
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,100

151
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,980
the strongy one and strongy two

152
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,540
we'd be like right i i don't know how loud this is gonna be

153
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:45,620
oh you mean we could have had background ambience this entire time oh my god listen to that smooth

154
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,620
jazz i'm gonna turn it down to weave it this game is rather loud

155
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,140

156
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,500

174
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,580
and it gets stuck oh i guess removed okay

175
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,500
i guess if the thing goes in the hole i get another one

176
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:34,020

179
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:00,980
gonna do it no way no i don't know how to like trick shot it i'm just letting the game do it honestly

180
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,500
yeah like the i got a free ball i got a free ball

181
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,140

182
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:27,060

183
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,820
wow fever score high score

184
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:45,940
total score half a million went on first try so i can lose green pegs activate magic powers

185
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:53,620
the first magic power is super gate it lasts for the next three turns what the heck is super gate

186
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,780
double guide no i don't know if i wanted that i'm gonna be honest i don't know if i wanted to

187
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,500
double up on it in the better time that thing the game isn't cheating for it it's just pego

188
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,340
it's for the what is super guide it's is that it it shows you where that stuff's gonna go

189
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,020
i have to admit i do like the ai taking over like yes please i suck thank you

190
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:28,340
i guess that's why the game's like so highly rated and satisfying because it does all the thinking for you

191
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:38,660
uh it shows you where the next bounce will go that's right i like i mean i think i could guess

192
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:46,420
in general where we might have gone oh we got a free shot from that right we've got seven left

193
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,900
okay let's do this one

194
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,060
okay we're getting a bit rough not gonna lie getting a bit rough

195
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,300
how am i oh right how am i supposed to get that one when all of these are in my way

196
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,460
i don't know maybe just okay there we go we got like rid of all of them in the way

197
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:19,780
okay i get it now i'm i understand i understand why this game is so highly rated

198
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:27,780
i understand i get it now oh my god i get it now

199
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:38,900
we gave in the purple pick is worth big points score over 25 000 points on a shot to get a free

200
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:39,860
ball

201
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,300
did i do it i don't know

202
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,940
free ball right oh i got double free ball right let's get that one

203
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,140
i love the way it just like pops off the map it's like okay i'm done

204
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,620
you miss this game straight into 100k again easy peasy streamer luck if that if that's not like

205
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,140
common right let's do that okay close enough i'll take it

206
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:20,900
oh no oh it keeps changing as well the the bonus ball like the purple one

207
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,820
we save and peggle with this one so it's technically a pinball derived game i think so

208
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:34,740
there's like a peggle too i like thought this was on xbox game pass peggle one and it was me

209
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,340
um

210
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:47,220
it was me at all to buy this on steam and then think i don't know if peggle two is good or not

211
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:54,260
but i mean honestly this is rather satisfying don't have to think you know oh my god controversial

212
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:01,060
take i don't know if i'm allowed to say this out loud i think it reminds me of like the suica

213
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:07,060
game where you can kind of just tune out not really care about the gameplay that much it's that bad

214
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:14,340
of me i don't know it feels like i have one fucking ball left yeah peace off mate okay let's try again

215
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:22,420
clear blue pegs out of the way um excuse me what the actual fuck are you really mad you'll learn

216
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:31,060
peggle two is the same but with tower ups extra aside oh yeah and we'll come on ei let me win

217
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:39,860
no it just like falls off the map it does absolutely nothing like oh thanks mate i guess

218
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:48,820

219
00:25:51,620 --> 00:26:00,820

220
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:09,540

227
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:08,340
the ball will head where you click okay you can fine-tune your shot with a mouse wheel and arrow

228
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,820
isn't haven't we already like established that or

00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,820
what's this multiple madness master jimmy leighton all right a fresh student are you ready for

240
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,900
multiple it's pretty extreme but you look like you can handle it use it early for mad points for

241
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:59,620
hit both green pegs in one shot for some massive multiple come on let's do it wait what there's

242
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,580
like a proper campaign my multiple pop an extra out when you hit a green peg

243
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,340
oh my god wait this game has like different

244
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:19,940
oh my gosh oh i missed sorry oh well i hit something on the way down

245
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:28,020
that's insane oh what the heck there's like a character literally a character select and like

246
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,260
pegle of all game

247
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,140
okay i'm trying to get like

248
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:45,380
no stop doing that the game hates me i need the ai to take over the pegle more like pachinko it

249
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,820
does remind me a little bit pachinko i don't know if you guys have ever watched this um like how

250
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,180
it's called well how about casino worker oh that was a really bad move it's like how a casino worker

251
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:04,980
like works in japan um and like he works in this pachinko thing which is um a really loud

252
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:11,940
like play area like it's so freaking loud but everyone's like addicted to it okay i don't know

253
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,180
right ai please ai please take over okay thank you okay

254
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,980
oh i missed oh that would have been so cool okay let's try that again

255
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,740
i like that it is inspired by pachinko oh is it

256
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:48,340
um only in this game is the mythical physics engine well i love the physics engine because

257
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,220
i'm actually i have a chance to win you see if it takes over have a chance to win but if it

258
00:30:53,220 --> 00:31:05,460
doesn't take over it's over let's go gambling in japan oh we've got one orange too we only got

259
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,020
two orange that really wasn't worth it that much

260
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,060
there's like so many blue in the okay that's what's like killing the run

261
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,900
it's what's killing the run because of all these blues in the way

262
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,100
i can't believe it

263
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,620
is this chat also crazy about magic what does that mean

264
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,620
if you get the it will you'll experience true ai do we have enough time to get there

265
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,140
i'm actually losing though uh and before it takes me like five hours to do this one level

266
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,580
um i'm just gonna go for the the old uh there's no way in heck where we're gonna get all that

267
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:09,700
somehow right drop it with your ai advice go one orange two orange three four

268
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,940
okay

269
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,900
they're clearing it out over there get to work get to work okay

270
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:33,460
no stop bouncing the only thing that should be bouncing is you on my peggle gameplay

271
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:41,860
okay i think that bouncing jump you can get there but you can also get stuck wait the game

272
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:48,900
can actually get hard doesn't the game take pity on me ai you can tell this is my third round

273
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,700
get in there lucky bounce damn right lucky bounce

274
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,300
i'm sure there's probably a better tactic to the way i'm doing it but

275
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:06,340
come on ai you know what you want to do give it to me baby

276
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,380
get clear these ones yeah that's what we want i've got a random free ball i'll take it

277
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,380
can we do it i don't know like this

278
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,940
i'm gonna mess up

279
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:31,620
the ai is you rimshot rimshot is that what we're calling it

280
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:41,860
the difficulty goes up i can't believe it oh my god i go hit the green peg on the left

281
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,500
side to make the multi ball pop on the right side

282
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:52,020
what i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna just send it i'm gonna just let them have fun

283
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,940
uh sure you

284
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:10,500
i love all the random hit has anyone raged at peggle i wouldn't say i've raged this game

285
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,660
you want me to i can make it happen

286
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,940
imagine not having the curse to tell you where the ball would go

287
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:28,900
well is there like a mod or something our setting is like aim assist

288
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,860
oh that wasn't a good one i'm a bit weak

289
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,980

292
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:59,460
okay you and then i do have enough if i don't mess up the shots basically i could just hit one at a

embers as well it would it looked very difficult oh the only thing i know about the lore of that

359
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,980
game hype and foul um is that uh

360
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:16,740
that um willow is apparently the easiest hype and felt high snow berries

361
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:24,580
uh we're playing bagel uh and i just realized the screen is horribly out of sync

362
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:31,700
you can't see the top of the screen what the heck is going on sorry this game is so old that i had

363
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:38,020
to like capture it awkwardly and nope that's my layout hold on a minute you're gonna have to do

364
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,540
i don't know why all of a sudden it's like zoomed out i didn't realize

365
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:53,380
you see and hello what hello lollipops not the other term where the heck is this game

366
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:01,620

367
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:10,740
right now hold on i know it's terrible scuff i promise okay why is it so cut off

368
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:21,460
puzzle capture nope that's me stop stop puzzle capture uh-huh

369
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:31,300

370
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:37,060
hold i've literally just what have i been streaming like that the whole time with the

371
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:44,260
thing cut off at the top is i've been cut off the whole time

372
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:53,380

374
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,940
literally notice that scuff streamer but i'm so glad i mean i enjoyed the game um

375
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,860
the only thing i know about don't starve is that willow is like op or something because she doesn't

376
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:21,780
get sanity in the darkness i believe and our fire restores her sanity and forest fires and stuff

377
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:29,140
or something like that i can't even remember uh last ball well we're not gonna get it so

378
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:35,140
just scuffle her how dare you your allegations and accusations

let's try yeah but this time actually try okay wait can i

380
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,780
that's unfortunate the green was there because it just gets shut down straight down

381
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:56,740
don't worry about it just focus on the pegging real and true but i'm so glad i mean i enjoyed

382
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:04,420
the little collab together i'm sure it was adorable i uh have a very cute thumbnail next week

god i'm robert i'm i'm like i'm sure there's something i'm missing

385
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:26,500

388
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:50,820
i don't

389
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,980
is there even a clear shot

390
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,180
is there i don't think there's a clear is there a clear shot that okay fuck off

391
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:12,180
all right i messed up but it's fine there isn't a clear shot right let's try that again

392
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:17,460
why stop putting the green one there that's such rubbish like spawn because it's just gonna fall

393
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:23,060
straight down the side i can't believe those were the words that introduced me your agency

394
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:30,260
would she be like oh welcome to be sucky right the rails

395
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,860
brah who knew pegging could be so hard literally why is it so difficult

396
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:45,060
point boosts i'm not here for your points i'm here for the win i want to unlock that it will

397
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:52,340
apparently it's op give me the owl you are mine you are mine

398
00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:02,740
so i'm having a rubbish luck on this one oh i missed also me who's doing like just terrible

399
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:09,700
am i really that bad am i supposed to be strategizing or something

400
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:16,740
because i'm starting i'm starting to feel personally attacked by this game why is it

401
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:25,780
given me such a random like terrible randomized luck i'm a feel personal attack this is not a

402
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:32,820
brainless game don't say such the horrible things to me what do you mean i have to use my brain

403
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:40,820
what do you mean i have to think that's outrageous these accusations these allegations they're unfounded

404
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:51,940
and i will be uh uh uh uh uh uh sucking at the game but not to be confused with the sucking at

405
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:57,140
the game which is a different thing it's meant for a patient i don't know my pago teachers life

406
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:02,820
lessons like patients i think but it does you have to think it's over literally any IQ game and i'm

407
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:08,660
done so absolutely done so munk munk

408
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,740
how many i've got three balls

409
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,980
like i suck i suck

410
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:31,780
this game gets a lot harder if you don't use your brain right thank goodness it's a two hour

411
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:38,980
stream then thank goodness over honestly i think the number of pegs we're assuming you're catching

412
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:45,300
many at the bottom of the three bar see that green one is always there which is useless

413
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:54,420
it doesn't do anything for me i assume the ai is going to get nicer the more you lose in a roll

414
00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:00,980
sure that's just straight copium but like why wouldn't the ai get nicer the more it realizes

415
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,860
i'm losing like come on come on

416
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:16,580
just get in the hole just get in the hole seriously cat we are actually we are doing tactical

417
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:24,900
pegging in real time we're getting a redonkulous i'm not even got into the eyes yet right let's get

418
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,420
more as if that didn't ping off the one that was strategically aiming for

419
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:37,300
okay let's get inside this okay there we go that's what i want inside

420
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:49,220
i'm ready getting that whole okay so we need to get rid of that one because it's the only one on

421
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:59,620
that side really i think we should just send it for this green one and then okay okay no maybe i have

422
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,540
oh it's not going to work

423
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:13,300
uh oh i think we did it no no no

424
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,380
how am i supposed to trick shot this

425
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:26,580
it's getting out to me how am i supposed to trick shot that how have i got this

426
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,340
blue on the left and bound cut

427
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,700
mods time out that wifling

428
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:41,860
time out that wifling that any wifling that says aim for that left one

429
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:50,420
get i'm out of here for 10 seconds get i'm out of here don't ever be spitting that again

430
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:59,300
and my general direction yeah absolute spanking for that one it should have been there

431
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:06,340
to be fair i was probably gonna lose anywhere i was gonna lose anyway it's fine it's fine

432
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,780
um ye don't worry if you never saw but i i've been having tummy pain

433
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:23,220
um i think due to stress no don't don't don't only come um but the reason why i'm bringing it up

434
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:30,500
is because i literally have no tummy ache right now so if that doesn't tell you the state of um

435
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:38,260
the the the environment on how happy i am to be with you to stream and stuff

436
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,900

440
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:09,780
correlation on why i don't have a sore tum tum right now i wonder what it oh we did it

444
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:46,180
the faces of the pyramid master cat's top meow i like yarn but not as much as i like my pyramid

445
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:53,940
it extends the edges of the free ball bucket for extra bounces and last second reprieve

446
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:01,940
it's subtle but it can really help you out graze with me into the pyramid and all

447
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,260
oh gaze not graze sorry if it's on my mind clearly graze with me

448
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:11,620
oh my god my magic ball turns the free ball bucket in our pyramid

449
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,140
what does that mean

450
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:24,900
huh oh to like bounce it back up okay okay i see it i respect it

451
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:33,060
i've hit like and retweet because the pegging community is dying uh can i even hit that one

452
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:46,260
mummy just this is a lot she doesn't seem to find her body it's withdrawal symptoms i mean

453
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:55,540
i mean you're not wrong because i i i'm definitely getting some relief

454
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:02,500
as i said my stomach doesn't hurt but like hurting last night and i didn't know if i should

455
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,740
take painkillers or not but i was convincing myself i'm like oh my god oh my god i'm turning

456
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:14,500
into peter jackson i've got a stomach ulcer oh like i was looking up symptoms and stuff i thought

457
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,300
um

458
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,860
radical free ball i think we did it on the first one

459
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,740
lack of sleep cousins though i've never had the cane just tell me eat before it's way different

460
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:43,140
than anything i've had before we game in my pyramid power last five turns

461
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,900
that's a lot of turns

462
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:59,860
oh oh tell him how it is pagle tell him how it is tell him how it is let them know pagle let them

463
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:04,740

464
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,660
okay well i need to get rid of that blue one anyway it's literally in the way so

465
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,660
yeah maybe it just the the after effects in the stress relief

466
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:25,300
probably as i said i'll give me give me one week and you know i'll probably just

467
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,740
i love putting a free ball in my damn street you're giving me more help

468
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:48,100

00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:17,460

casual cute game is this for children be honest am i losing that child's game right now i've already

492
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:28,820
lost once this week to a child's game or what i thought was a child's game i don't even know i'm

493
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:36,020
gonna have to look up who the the customers were because it wasn't me it's more cat it's a baby

494
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:42,660
game not even child it's a newborn baby game you know what your accusations are on

495
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,860
it wasn't out you rude thing you

496
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:58,340
you okay i need to wait for it to go away don't do that again

497
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,580
how am i supposed to time the other ones like all the way over here i'm just gonna

498
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:14,900
oh the blue one was in the way haha i had tunnel vision it's a boomer casual phone game like candy

499
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:21,220
oh my god i'm i've never been more insulted in my life sorry but it's a good game it's a

500
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,260
good game i'm i'm addicted and i can't quit

501
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:43,460
bonk i've got am i gonna make it oh my god we might make it hold on we might make it

502
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:52,660
oh i didn't have to do anything great this is stage three i don't know if we're going to be able

503
01:00:52,660 --> 01:01:00,500
to unlock all the characters in time but i ain't gonna stop me i'm addicted to not the child i'm

504
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:07,940
addicted oh i've got a fever and the only cure is extreme fever haha get it get it not really

505
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,900
it's ironic because the cure for my fever is actually more fever

506
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:21,540
okay this one actually looks uh this one's got a little a little space to it

507
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,500
they're 55 levels okay this might need a part two

508
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:35,060
not gonna lie i actually didn't expect and not that i didn't i think i was gonna hate it i didn't

509
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:40,260
expect to actually enjoy the casual nature i think because like obviously yesterday's stream was

510
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:49,460
very long um it's kind of nice just to tune out and watch ball go and do things you know

511
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,820
it's a good just hand game absolutely agreed wholeheartedly

512
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:55,540
okay

513
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,060
i spell a game and you can just you Japanese in the background

514
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,900
whoo although this one

515
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:18,500
got a little i don't really that confident unless it keeps giving me free balls i'm literally not

516
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:23,220
gonna argue i'm not gonna argue i'm not

517
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,180
yeah i think the pyramid is like a pretty good bonus as i said it's like hitting stuff that

518
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,500
might be in our way even though the ball should like you know perish on the

519
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:41,540
the wheel thing we need a yap game tierless honestly so does that mean strong as big enough

520
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:49,220
i mean in this stream yeah such a good game

521
01:02:51,780 --> 01:03:02,180
okay i think we're gonna do it not to jinx ourselves not to jinx from the hit video game

522
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:08,180
legal legends which turned into the hit show arcane which apparently the next season's coming out

523
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:13,700

524
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:16,500

547
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:29,540
but mentally it's too hard for me to write right now to love that face blast gotta blast

548
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:36,740
i'm jimmy neutron okay i can't even reach the one over there okay it has to do with the

549
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:37,540
thing

550
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:46,020
that's what i said sodium chloride jimmy what you even on a

551
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:54,340
what is that sodium chloride it's just salt it's a thick do you think you're superior

552
01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:02,580
the crowdsourced it i knew such an innocent game could have a pegging and edging real

553
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:08,580
uh this one is

554
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:15,220
you didn't see that that was embarrassing okay that was genuinely embarrassing

555
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,260
genuinely didn't expect to just

556
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,060
okay uh i'm gonna see

557
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,860
i'm gonna go for no i'm not i'm gonna go for this one because it's

558
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:39,940
and that one will get picked up on the way down because of the way there

559
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:47,460
oh i did it i did it

560
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:58,820
we i saw good at this the game looks so old the game is so old um i am the what you see on

561
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:05,060
stream is actually bigger than what i'm playing on that makes sense the screen is so small i

562
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:09,460
couldn't get it to work in full screen at all it just was not happening and we also surpassed

563
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:19,540
5000 total score uh great something sometimes blue pegs block a good shot to orange hit the blue

564
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:25,940
we still in tutorial mode after all this time that was the worst way you could have fallen

565
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:31,860
and you know exactly what you did video i was clearly supposed to go on the green one

566
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,900
right see you gotta blast

567
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:41,460
oh wait maybe it i don't know if i should have kept that i actually

568
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:49,460
gotta blast oh my god point first when i get literally no pegs oh my god thank you for the point

569
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,540
oh a long shot bonk

570
01:08:55,620 --> 01:09:01,140
how much did this franchise make if they made a peg or two i can definitely see the easy addictive

571
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:06,180
nature i played somewhere still on the xbox that's literally how i know about this game

572
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,660
i thought it was on game pass but only two is on game pass so

573
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:18,980
it maybe we'll finish so i've got a sonic hero stream coming up maybe we'll continue to play this after

574
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:26,580
sugar i don't think i can hit that either of them

575
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,140
oh

576
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,140
what i was gonna do is hit it off of that so it like bounces onto that do you know what i mean

577
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:46,580
oh right that was far one that was far too much

578
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,100
i can't yeah i can't do it oh that's so annoying

579
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,540
let's play oh let's try that game

580
01:09:57,540 --> 01:10:02,980
mummies really enjoying the peg i think this is a good game like i don't remember playing it i just

581
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:11,220
remember like mucking about but like this is enjoyable this is like perfect that's the material

582
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:18,580
as well like especially for streamers that like are really sure are too deep into games i mean

583
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:24,100
f**k just put this up this is like so easy i am currently brainless i think to me and just

584
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:29,380
yapping it in i think this is a fantastic game for streamers and i heavily recommend it for

585
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:39,780
oh we got a free ball okay what am i looking at can i destroy look at that green one oh i definitely

586
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:45,940
have very bad tunnel vision in these kind of games please work with me game oh my gosh

587
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:53,300
does that have enough if the game doesn't hate me i might have enough oh no the game hates me it's okay

588
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:55,300
come on

589
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:05,860

592
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:29,380
bonus on him i feel like it's a guilty pleasure by hardcore gamers is why chat knows all the lore

593
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:38,580
exactly pegels are just thunder game damn straight gloar purple pegs change place after every show

594
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,020
points are plenty if you catch the purple pig

595
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:51,380
i'm already i can't believe i'm saying it but literally i'm already reading it 10 out of 10

596
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:58,660
it's so good okay let's get right into the oh i was gonna put it in the ball but i guess not

597
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:06,580
i will definitely take the free ball stop going to the right side where there's a

598
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,820
how am i doing that i don't know

599
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:17,940
literally i don't see any creditables where violet gets her ultra reshield out and dash is like

600
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:22,580
how are you doing that and she's like i don't know literally that's what's happening to me right

601
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:29,060
now i'm like uh how are we winning i'm putting zero strategy into this oh god that's right in the

602
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:37,620
way of that one okay oh okay that's what i mean with tunnel vision

603
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:45,140
i did a trick shot i'm so smart okay can i do it with these two

604
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,500
oh i think i won again

605
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:55,940
okay we're gonna be done with the alien real quick real real quick

606
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:04,340
absolute mlg hours 360 no scope get me on the speedrun record get me on the accolades

607
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:09,460

608
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:18,500
just amazing everyone like ah you're welcome the lorp a glit clear more orange pegs early

609
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:25,780
or focus on single tricky glass sure you don't have to tell me twice

610
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,900
oh this one looks actually a wee bit difficult

611
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:32,260
but i did get the left side

612
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:46,420
i was hoping it was gonna bounce on that orange okay i did it did hit the orange one there

613
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:51,860
let's get up wait no why did i go for the bonus point there's no point then go for the bonus point

614
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:56,580
strongly beating the pain what about you the speedruns like five seconds or something

615
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,300
they'll be like skipping the the

616
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,620
because they're just so good at the game

617
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:13,060
mmm this one's a tricky map all right especially if the ai's just like beating me up stop pinging

618
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:18,660
to the left stop pinging to the left do you understand me get in the middle right now

619
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:26,180
no get the orange ones you're missing everything on purpose video game i know exactly what shenanigans

620
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:34,180
you're up to this last ball right well nothing's happening so the adventure mode speedrun is

621
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:41,860
four to eight minutes i yapped longer than the speedrun of this game

622
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:48,420
how can someone play 45 eight 48 minutes what i don't get it

623
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:55,460
well we're okay we maybe maybe maybe aren't making the the history of this as if i missed it

624
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,780
okay okay this is actually pretty rough not gonna lie

625
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,380
hmm i'm penalizing i'm penalizing

626
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:10,900
i'm strategizing i'm strategizing i'm pinging i'm pinging gotta blast

627
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:21,620
okay can i hit that one get everything out my way thank you because it's literally all in the

628
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,940
way of each other and i only have five left

629
01:15:37,940 --> 01:15:42,820
clearly she needs more experience with pegging i for one volunteer's tribute thank you refling

630
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,140
exactly that's what i want to see so we actually technically

631
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:51,460
oh but everything's in the way of that one

632
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,740
there's nothing we can do it's all yeah

633
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:07,700

a jet my magic power is flippies after hitting the green pig click anywhere to slip them

643
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:11,140

644
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:18,820
oh my god that's kind of OP wait so the ball just never drops

645

898
01:48:18,260 --> 01:48:24,500
smallest chest of everyone in violor um so yeah the best you're gonna get is maybe a clap a round
