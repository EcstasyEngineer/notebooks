0	2000	Hold on hold on hold on
7000	11000	There's not a lot of chance, I will chance my life
14000	16000	I hope I'm on the right thing
16000	17000	And then
18000	19000	They're not messed up
20000	22000	Who's driving this booze?
22000	24000	Come on boys is so messed up
27000	28000	Valor
30000	35000	Am I streaming? I don't see it.
35000	41000	It'll be live for 40 seconds. I can't even see myself.
41000	44000	Oh, there we go. Hey, I can hear myself.
44000	47000	Ah, I totally lost my voice. Testing.
47000	49000	Ah, freaking scary.
49000	54000	Broke my damn voice on that bloody stream.
54000	58000	Didn't that be alert? Did you like that smoke? Did you like it?
59000	63000	Right, from here on out, it's nothing but scuffing memes.
63000	66000	If you're looking for professionals, go elsewhere, buddy.
66000	69000	Go to Shibi's stream. There's no happening here.
69000	74000	I promise you, mate. My voice is so strange right now.
74000	76000	Oh, my goodness. Just the way we were like,
76000	78000	Oh, it's been a bloody while since we've been together.
78000	82000	Fuck me, man. That took me a year to spawn this.
82000	84000	Oh, my God.
84000	88000	I did it, though. Holy shit, we did it.
88000	90000	Feet sniffer. I didn't mean to imply greed.
90000	92000	No, you didn't. I know you didn't. Please don't worry.
92000	94000	Please don't worry. It's fine.
94000	99000	The only reason I say greed is because of the perspective thing.
99000	105000	Oh, fucking mischief, reflins. My fucking God.
105000	109000	What a year it's been. Holy crap.
109000	111000	I know I'm supposed to talk about my debut,
111000	115000	but let's be honest, we're all reflins here.
115000	117000	Oh, fucking mischiefs.
117000	120000	Of course, your names were going to be refling.
120000	122000	Oh, my God.
122000	125000	What do you mean you became a squid vtuber
125000	129000	just so your name may only reflect you in another life?
129000	131000	Oh, come on. Refling.
131000	135000	Come on. If I'm on a reef, get it?
135000	139000	Great barrier. Reef. Reef.
139000	144000	Oh, I'm so excited to play Assassin's Creed Brotherhood with you.
144000	149000	When this stream ends, I'm going to unlist all my streams.
149000	154000	Any reefers on the track? Are reefers cannabis?
154000	156000	I can't say that.
158000	160000	Does reeflings mean something different?
160000	163000	In another life, I had a fan base called Reeflings,
163000	166000	but it was spelled slightly different.
166000	172000	And I made it pronounced the same, but spelled differently.
172000	174000	Yeah.
174000	175000	Don't worry.
175000	176000	Don't worry.
176000	178000	If you're not really familiar with me from the past,
178000	180000	don't worry about it.
180000	182000	Okay, don't worry about it.
182000	185000	I'm just strong at cuttles. Let's keep it that way.
185000	187000	Thank you very much.
187000	190000	Okay, am I actually going through my 2.0
190000	194000	or are we just squidding around?
195000	198000	My bottle.
198000	201000	I have my reefing mail.
201000	202000	Skullfish.
202000	204000	Oh, Skullfish is so good.
204000	207000	Oh, that's actually really small.
207000	209000	Okay.
209000	210000	Thank you.
210000	212000	Right, I'll actually go through my slides,
212000	215000	but I'm not really sure if there's much of a point,
215000	219000	because, well,
219000	224000	that's Johnny's 365 from Beast's Suck It.
224000	225000	Moment.
225000	226000	Product or moment.
226000	227000	Right, let me drink my cola.
227000	228000	Let me drink my cola.
228000	230000	Yeah, I was supposed to say 5.3.
230000	233000	Also, someone doubted that Scots is a recognized language.
233000	234000	It is.
234000	237000	So, you know how it sounds like I'm speaking English here all the time?
237000	239000	I'm going to give you a sentence, okay?
239000	242000	I'm going to type it in chat so you can read it.
249000	253000	So, that is a sentence in Scots that I've just typed, okay?
253000	255000	And it says,
255000	257000	Are you coming to my bit tonight?
257000	260000	That means, are you coming to my house tonight?
260000	262000	That's Scots.
262000	263000	He has a bit different.
263000	264000	It's not in the best sense,
264000	267000	but it's what I can think of on the top of my head, but yeah.
267000	268000	Are you coming to my bit tonight?
268000	270000	It means, are you coming to my house?
270000	274000	And I purposely don't really speak with a lot of slang
274000	277000	or mumble the way I naturally do,
277000	280000	because I'm quite naturally monotone and mumbley,
280000	282000	because the problem is,
282000	287000	you guys don't understand me because I'm Scots.
287000	295000	But if you are British or you're familiar with the Scottish accent,
295000	297000	then I probably actually don't sound from Scots indeed,
297000	300000	but it is what it is.
300000	302000	And also, I've been very, like,
302000	305000	when you're on the internet, you're very Americanised
305000	307000	with what you consume.
307000	310000	Does it take all your efforts to pronounce every syllable
310000	311000	and not speak Scots?
311000	315000	No, my mother dearest,
315000	318000	she actually taught me,
318000	325000	she discouraged me from speaking in slang,
325000	328000	so I doesn't always naturally come out,
328000	330000	but here's what it is.
331000	334000	Here's how it was at the beginning.
334000	337000	I said, fucking cheers to that mate, cheers to that.
337000	340000	But yeah, technically, legally, on paper,
340000	342000	because I was born in Scotland,
342000	345000	I could speak two languages, thank you.
345000	349000	I don't need any help from Joe Lingo, let's go.
349000	354000	But yeah, so I'm a siren that can't sing.
354000	356000	Gee willikers, I wonder why.
356000	357000	I just don't have a voice.
357000	359000	I'm also tone deaf, by the way,
359000	362000	so I hope you're ready for drunk karaoke streams.
362000	365000	That stuff's gonna be intense.
365000	368000	Let's see where these slides are.
368000	371000	So both of your parents are Scots, eh?
377000	380000	Yeah, the band-aids hold up, still top tier.
380000	383000	Yep, very top tier.
383000	385000	Mongolian throat singing.
385000	387000	The reason I don't like Mongolian throat singing
387000	389000	is because cats don't like Mongolian throat singing,
389000	391000	because of the vibration.
391000	393000	It's an unpleasant sound.
393000	396000	I have learned many traits of cats, so I don't like it.
396000	398000	Drunk karaoke.
398000	401000	Shibi's doing drunk ASMR this week.
401000	403000	If that's your...
403000	405000	Is that your thing?
405000	407000	To say, is that your thing?
407000	409000	And Scots, you go, is that your thing?
409000	410000	Is that I?
410000	411000	Is that your thing?
411000	414000	Oh, it is him and I.
414000	416000	And...
416000	418000	There you go.
418000	421000	Yeah, I did some basic stuff.
421000	424000	Oh, my lore's being retconned, by the way.
424000	426000	Thanks to you guys.
426000	428000	Apparently, my weaknesses are mirrors,
428000	431000	which I really fucking like.
433000	435000	I'm definitely gonna do something with that,
435000	437000	because I think it's such a cool thing.
437000	439000	I should have done it like a fucking character reference,
439000	441000	like strengths, weaknesses,
441000	443000	because that would have been so much cooler to do the havel.
443000	445000	I actually have started reading this year.
445000	447000	I had a really rough year last year.
447000	449000	Gee, I wonder.
449000	451000	And I started...
451000	452000	I picked up reading.
452000	454000	I have never read in my life.
454000	456000	And...
456000	459000	Turns out, I really like the stopian novels.
459000	461000	Like George Orwell was so good.
461000	463000	Like Animal Farm in 1984.
463000	465000	I absolutely love 1984.
465000	467000	Fahrenheit was good.
467000	468000	I've read the classics.
468000	470000	I'm not read that much, but...
471000	473000	I see you're readin' right?
473000	475000	Yeah.
475000	477000	The Women in the Dunes, as well,
477000	480000	is like the perfect, like, book,
480000	486000	because it, like, encapsulates, like, human nature.
486000	488000	And...
488000	491000	I just love, like, depressing books.
491000	493000	I love being depressed at the end and being like,
493000	495000	no, humanity didn't prevail.
495000	497000	No, not humanity, what's the word?
497000	500000	Human nature didn't prevail against the odds.
500000	502000	I've got the Hobbit.
502000	506000	I've not read it yet, but I have the physical copy of the Hobbit.
506000	508000	And I'm so excited.
508000	510000	Um...
510000	512000	Yeah, I'm not much of a...
512000	514000	The girls, by far, are more weebs than me.
514000	516000	I am, by far, the gamer.
516000	518000	Like, I played the most games.
518000	520000	Doesn't mean I'm good before anyone fucking complains.
520000	522000	Every time you mention you play games,
522000	526000	what do you mean you're not top 500 in this game?
526000	529000	You suck, like, no, I play video games.
529000	532000	Fucking relax, I bet you're shit at them, too.
532000	534000	Like, my god, can you hear yourself?
534000	537000	You're actually, like, so fucking negative.
537000	540000	Anyway, I'll help you get more positive.
540000	542000	Actually, the reason why you're negative
542000	544000	is because you're KD's negative,
544000	546000	because you're scrubbing the game.
546000	548000	That's why you just project.
548000	550000	Anyway, that's just me.
550000	552000	Uh, music, I'm really generic with music.
552000	555000	I don't listen to music much, okay?
555000	558000	Uh, movies, Lord of the Rings, we're at hell, yeah?
558000	561000	Uh, if you don't know, uh, I have plans for on Christmas
561000	565000	and Boxing Day, uh, to watch Lord of the Rings
565000	568000	and The Hobbit, Phil Marathon, absolutely adore it.
568000	570000	Uh, that would be public stream,
570000	573000	no gate keeping, no membership, none of that jazz.
573000	578000	Oh, special thank you to everyone who watched the debut.
578000	582000	I already meet the requirements for monetization on YouTube.
582000	587000	The problem is the stats don't update for, like, 48 hours.
587000	590000	So I can technically, like, I already meet the requirements.
590000	592000	I just need to submit myself to YouTube.
592000	595000	And then I can do my monetization stream!
595000	599000	And I'm so excited, because my idea is so cursed.
599000	602000	But I just want to say, for anyone who's watching me right now,
602000	606000	if you don't like VTubers doing webcam streams,
606000	609000	showing their hands or their feet,
609000	613000	I'm not a VTuber for you, however FILR Girls, absolutely.
613000	615000	Check them out in the description.
615000	617000	You can hit subscribe!
617000	618000	Uhm...
619000	623000	But, yes, absolutely no hints to what my monetization stream's going to be.
623000	624000	Uhuhuhuh!
624000	625000	Mmmhmm?
626000	627000	Mmmhmmmmmm!
627000	631000	You ain't ready, I literally need to go to a nail parlor.
631000	636000	I've been growing my nails for three weeks
636000	638000	for the monetization stream.
638000	645000	of having long nails. I hate it, I hate it, but I'm doing it for you.
645000	654000	Animes, uh, um, Kaki-Guri, still one of my top. Kaki-Guri, Kaga-Guri, Kaga-Guri, still
654000	659000	one of my top. It's probably one of my top. I don't, I can't think of anything that.
659000	664000	Actually, fun fact, do you want to know the very first anime I got tricked into watching?
664000	671000	Fucking Boku no Pico, or whatever the frickin' Dilla, Piccadilla sauce, whatever the frickin' thing is.
671000	678000	That is the first exposure to anime I ever had, and I was mortified. Mortified!
678000	683000	I had no concept, a little innocent me, tick-tackin' on the keyboard.
683000	687000	Ooh, this anime's being recommended! I should watch it!
687000	692000	And then, so I was really dumb, do you know how it has a warning at the start?
692000	697000	I didn't know what that word meant, like, and I watched it.
697000	701000	I was like, where is this ice cube going?
701000	707000	And, like, and actually, I want to use my notice.
707000	715000	My first ever exposure to, uh, uh, like an anime that wasn't Boku no Pico, it related, was a brother in...
715000	719000	Oh my god, ooh! Sorry, I thought there was a spider on me, holy crap.
719000	722000	It wasn't. It was my cover.
722000	728000	My first anime exposure, it was either...
728000	733000	It must have been an anime based on a manga that got popular, because that's how most anime's turned out, Ida.
733000	738000	It was a brother and sister. Hold on! Hold on!
738000	740000	Hold the frickin' phone for y'all circle men.
740000	744000	It was brother and sister, and then it was...
745000	750000	The sister is a flesh eater, and the guy's like, oh, it's fine.
750000	755000	And he has, like, regenerative powers or something?
755000	758000	I'm sure one of you guys know what it is.
758000	765000	It was either a manga I read or a thingy, but she had to, like, eat him for some reason,
765000	768000	and she was like, oh, I'm so sorry for eating you, hum hum hum hum hum.
768000	770000	And I was like, oh!
770000	777000	Yeah, that was the first of her anime exposure that, like, I got into, and I was like, oh, this shit's crazy.
777000	781000	And then I discovered what Pururin is.
781000	784000	Many a day on Pururin.
784000	787000	And then they shut down the website, Rippin' Piss.
787000	790000	You will be missed, actually. Sorry, my voice is absolutely short.
790000	794000	I promise this isn't my default voice, it's because I'm so excited to talk to you.
794000	797000	I've broken my voice already.
798000	801000	I came back.
801000	804000	Shut up, Pururin did not come. Hold on.
804000	806000	Hold on, we're doing research like Pururin.
806000	808000	Pururin.
808000	811000	Oh my god, no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
813000	817000	I have, I may have a bikini toggle.
819000	824000	I may have a bikini toggle for water ASMR streams.
825000	827000	I am so sorry.
829000	833000	I will unbind the keys for an X-treme.
833000	837000	I will take your word chat that Pururin is back.
838000	841000	I apologize for that.
843000	845000	My deepest condolence.
849000	851000	Okay, no.
852000	854000	Okay, I don't even know what to say to that.
854000	857000	Right, move it on, swiftly.
857000	859000	And, swiftly, swiftly.
859000	862000	We'll take another drink of me, Nikola.
865000	868000	I don't even know what key did that.
868000	870000	Was it you, maybe?
872000	875000	Literally, I look over at my screen and I'm like, where's my Yucata?
875000	878000	Where did it go? Why is it through the window?
878000	880000	Anyway, next, next thing.
880000	882000	Yes, Childhood Games!
882000	885000	Oh my god, I am so happy that Xbox Game Pass is a thing.
885000	888000	I need to create an account, I don't know what to call it yet.
890000	893000	I want to make it something like Mimi or Funny.
896000	898000	But yeah, anyway, I'm an Xbox kid
898000	902000	and if you were able to catch the group stream,
902000	906000	it's actually true that I had to present games to my dad to buy for me.
907000	910000	Or he would just buy it for me because he was like,
910000	912000	oh, that's good for response-o.
913000	915000	Inherit your dad's account.
919000	924000	So, these are the majority of the games that I remember.
924000	927000	I'm going to do tons of Xbox games.
927000	929000	I'm an Xbox kid.
929000	932000	I never had a PlayStation at all.
933000	936000	So I didn't have access.
936000	938000	I had a PlayStation.
938000	940000	My dad got a PlayStation 1.
940000	945000	I didn't know how to read, like, no.
949000	952000	So I'm just trying to think, like, the timeline.
952000	955000	A lot of these games I've played, I didn't even have the ability to read yet.
958000	961000	Like, I used to watch my dad play the games because I was so small.
963000	966000	But yeah, basically.
966000	968000	Sonic Generations.
971000	974000	Is Sonic Generations the one that was made after Sonic Heroes?
975000	977000	I've not played BioShock 2.
977000	979000	No, I played BioShock 1.
979000	981000	Well, you had bees.
981000	983000	Bees?
984000	986000	My sweet little bumblebee.
986000	988000	I know what you want from me.
993000	996000	Hypnosis-themed feature where I really like hypnosis.
996000	1000000	I've never done it before, but I'm going to participate in it and try and get it for you.
1000000	1002000	I never played Sonic Generations then.
1002000	1006000	No, I played Sonic Heroes and then there was a bit of a skip.
1006000	1009000	I played Sonic Unleashed where he's like that werewolf.
1009000	1012000	But I got stuck in the game because I was, like, too young.
1014000	1017000	Not very smart. I'm not a very smart gamer, okay?
1017000	1021000	Which is why I am perfectly happy with
1021000	1023000	hand-holding through games.
1023000	1026000	Some streamers really don't like backseat gaming.
1026000	1028000	For me, absolutely do not mind it.
1028000	1030000	I'm daft, okay?
1030000	1032000	I'm completely daft.
1032000	1034000	I have no clue what's going on.
1036000	1039000	Would we be hypnotised to vote for you as president?
1039000	1041000	Oh my god.
1043000	1046000	But yeah, so definitely going to replay a lot of Xbox games
1046000	1050000	as my childhood dream was that 100k thingy.
1051000	1055000	I only had the opportunity to play Fable 3.
1055000	1057000	Wait, let me see what's behind me.
1057000	1059000	Hold on. What's behind me?
1059000	1062000	Oh, Viva Pinata, Trials Evolution.
1062000	1068000	Right now my game of choice is The Binding of Isaac.
1068000	1071000	It's an absolutely fantastic game.
1071000	1074000	It becomes multiplayer in November.
1074000	1078000	Multiplayer in November.
1078000	1081000	Just a warning for anyone who is out there
1081000	1083000	binding their Isaac.
1083000	1086000	November games, multiplayer games
1086000	1089000	are most likely going to be Isaac.
1089000	1092000	I apologise. I too.
1094000	1096000	The best Halo game in your opinion.
1096000	1099000	I'm biased and can say combat evolved
1099000	1101000	because my dad used to play it over and over
1101000	1104000	and I used to hide behind the couch.
1104000	1107000	I was so scared from the grunty oneies.
1107000	1109000	They were so scary.
1109000	1111000	You actually finished Meat Boy.
1111000	1113000	Damn it, like I finished Meat Boy.
1113000	1115000	No, I played it. These games don't necessarily mean
1115000	1117000	I'm finished them, but yeah.
1117000	1119000	Hamster's Lifestream win.
1119000	1122000	Yeah, you want to play a hamster game together.
1122000	1124000	Yeah.
1125000	1127000	Is combat evolved the first one?
1127000	1131000	Yeah, sorry. Halo combat evolved is the first one.
1132000	1136000	You're like Crash Land and everyone dies, but you...
1136000	1138000	It's just scary.
1140000	1142000	They're straight up.
1142000	1144000	What in the strip club, straight up binding it
1144000	1147000	and by it, let's just say my Isaac.
1147000	1149000	Oh my god, my favourite meme right now
1149000	1152000	is like, replace the A with a F
1152000	1155000	and then it says fart, relax, snowflake.
1155000	1158000	It's called Dark Humour. It's my favourite meme right now.
1159000	1166000	I've also got those old games
1166000	1168000	from the Xbox original days.
1168000	1171000	Definitely going to give them a shot again.
1171000	1174000	AC actually mentioned that she played
1174000	1176000	American McGee's Alice
1176000	1180000	and I've played Alice in Madness Returns
1180000	1182000	and I thought she was going to say
1182000	1185000	she played American McGee's Alice, but...
1186000	1188000	Yeah.
1188000	1190000	God of War
1193000	1195000	enjoyed that, that was good.
1195000	1199000	I need to play Shadow of Mordor properly.
1199000	1201000	I actually want to play the Golem game
1201000	1204000	that got absolutely review bombed.
1204000	1207000	Everyone hated it, but I feel like I'm like
1207000	1210000	Tismo enough because it's Lord of the Rings
1210000	1212000	Lord of the Rings related
1212000	1214000	to play it and the entire time
1214000	1216000	I want to do Golem's voice
1216000	1218000	and I'm like, thank you.
1218000	1220000	I like absolutely wrecked my voice
1220000	1222000	to like roleplay as Golem.
1222000	1225000	I mean, you know, we started again.
1225000	1228000	I'd love to do that.
1228000	1230000	My face when I didn't realise Madness Returns
1230000	1231000	in the sequel.
1231000	1234000	Oh, mercy, I'm about to ruin your day.
1234000	1237000	There was a third instalment called
1237000	1241000	Alice Asylum and EA rejected it.
1242000	1244000	The game has been fully conceptualised,
1244000	1247000	EA rejected it and now it's gathering dust.
1247000	1250000	So that's just to ruin your day.
1250000	1252000	There was to be a third instalment
1252000	1255000	of Alice in Wonderland and EA, yeah, again, ruined it.
1255000	1257000	Yay, yay, yay.
1259000	1261000	Do we hey, yeah? Yeah, we hey, yeah.
1261000	1264000	Sorry to ruin your day, but that's true.
1265000	1267000	What other games?
1267000	1269000	Dishonoured was good.
1269000	1272000	Stealth was a bit funny at times,
1272000	1274000	but definitely happy to play that again.
1276000	1278000	I'm gonna burp, I'm so sorry.
1278000	1279000	Oh, no, I'm not.
1279000	1281000	I don't have to be professional anymore.
1287000	1288000	It's Karambit.
1288000	1290000	Oh, my God, what a terrible man.
1292000	1294000	I heard Monster Hunter.
1294000	1296000	Oh, hi, Dempah again.
1296000	1298000	How's it going, Dempah?
1299000	1302000	I've heard Monster Hunter has bagpipes in it,
1302000	1306000	like as a weapon, but it's the most, like, hardest thing to play
1306000	1308000	instead of, like, a sword.
1311000	1313000	Dishonoured, good, yeah, good.
1313000	1315000	I'm drawing while watching you.
1316000	1318000	Did you guys know that Dempah
1318000	1321000	created her own VTuber art model?
1321000	1322000	Isn't that amazing?
1322000	1324000	That's, like, literally so talented.
1325000	1329000	Talented as in terms of all her hard-working effort
1329000	1331000	and blood, sweat and tears that she's put into
1331000	1333000	honing her craft and art.
1333000	1336000	I read this thing ages ago about artists being, like,
1336000	1338000	we don't really like it when you say it's, like,
1338000	1340000	overnight talent, because it's not.
1340000	1342000	It's, like, you honed your craft
1342000	1344000	and, like, you should be proud of honing your craft.
1344000	1346000	You didn't just spawn in as an artist, you know?
1346000	1349000	Gifted, that's it, you're not gifted.
1349000	1351000	You honed your craft, you spent years on it.
1351000	1353000	You got your XP bar raised.
1354000	1357000	Anyway, that's just my small rant about being nice to artists.
1357000	1360000	They aren't gifted, they have spent years
1360000	1364000	specialising into a skill bar, okay?
1364000	1365000	Thank you.
1367000	1369000	More VTuber babies.
1377000	1379000	Oh, you know what game I really liked?
1379000	1385000	I say this every time is, um, what is it called?
1386000	1389000	College or a ghost alien mode was so good.
1389000	1391000	I don't care what anyone says.
1391000	1392000	It's so very good.
1392000	1394000	I could for you any young.
1394000	1396000	We in boys with Denver.
1396000	1397000	Denver, Denver.
1397000	1399000	Sorry, I said it from my voice.
1399000	1401000	Yeah, notice there's no Halo 2,
1401000	1404000	because I never got a chance to play it.
1404000	1406000	No, there is, is Halo not there?
1406000	1407000	Wait, Halo 2 should be there.
1407000	1408000	I played all the Halo's.
1408000	1410000	Hold on, Analyze, Analyze them in.
1411000	1413000	Zoom in. Analyzing.
1413000	1415000	Oh wait, okay, I can grab it.
1415000	1416000	Where is it?
1417000	1418000	It's a place for debut.
1418000	1419000	There we go.
1419000	1426000	Analyzing where Halo 2, Halo 2, Halo 2 unidentified.
1426000	1427000	Okay, I guess.
1427000	1429000	I have played all the Halo's.
1429000	1432000	I wanted to, I've not played the new Red Dead Redemption.
1432000	1433000	Oh my God.
1433000	1434000	Well, it's not new.
1434000	1436000	It's been out for years now by this point,
1436000	1439000	but definitely do Assassin's Creed.
1439000	1443000	We're 100% doing Ezio's storyline.
1443000	1445000	I'm going to be really controversial.
1445000	1448000	Couldn't be a shite once they killed Ezio off.
1448000	1449000	I mean, he had three installments.
1449000	1451000	It's not like he was killed off.
1451000	1452000	Wait, what?
1452000	1453000	I didn't know it fit.
1453000	1454000	Does that not fit you?
1455000	1456000	What?
1457000	1458000	You should be there.
1458000	1459000	Okay, I did it, I did it.
1460000	1462000	Alien isolation, get to fuck.
1462000	1463000	I'm not playing that game.
1463000	1464000	That's a terrible game.
1464000	1465000	Wait, what is?
1466000	1467000	That's chat.
1469000	1470000	That's not background music.
1472000	1473000	Halo?
1473000	1474000	You need to be above?
1475000	1476000	Yeah, jeez.
1476000	1477000	Wait, no, chat.
1477000	1478000	Oh my God, sorry.
1478000	1479000	I'm having a stroke.
1479000	1480000	And not the good kind.
1480000	1482000	Best Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.
1482000	1485000	Assassin's Creed Brotherhood is the best Assassin's Creed
1485000	1486000	installment of all time.
1486000	1488000	I am not taking any questions, statements,
1488000	1491000	arguments, or bomb threats to Veiler headquarters.
1491000	1492000	I'm sorry.
1492000	1493000	It's just a bit.
1493000	1494000	I will explain.
1494000	1495000	We're playing it tomorrow.
1495000	1499000	I will explain to you chapter by chapter,
1499000	1502000	step by step on why it's just the most perfect
1502000	1507000	thought out, like, optimized game for, like,
1507000	1508000	gameplay.
1508000	1511000	Just every, I will, I will explain it all.
1511000	1514000	I'm actually making a video essay about Assassin's
1514000	1515000	Creed Brotherhood.
1515000	1517000	It's going to be one of my donuts on rewards.
1517000	1519000	I've already recorded the footage to do it.
1519000	1522000	I just need to write the script and everything.
1522000	1525000	But, like, I kid you not, I'm doing, like, a video essay
1525000	1526000	40 minutes long.
1526000	1527000	I don't care.
1527000	1529000	I'm, like, going to fill Tizmo and Lush.
1529000	1532000	Okay, we've been on games for quite a while now.
1532000	1535000	I'm, like, you guys are probably sick of staring at these
1535000	1536000	games.
1536000	1538000	Um, how did that not?
1538000	1541000	I don't think I've done this wrong.
1541000	1543000	Hey, hello.
1543000	1546000	Uh, I think I've said all the games.
1546000	1547000	Yeah.
1547000	1550000	Oh, we're playing old-school Rinske.
1551000	1553000	Eight hour Assassin's Creed Brotherhood lore coming in.
1553000	1555000	What have I done?
1555000	1558000	Probably, like, less than an hour.
1558000	1564000	Um, yes, probably, uh, old-school Rinscape is our weekend
1564000	1565000	game.
1565000	1567000	It's going to be mostly a multiplayer game for this month
1567000	1574000	until June 19th when the Eldon...
1574000	1578000	Wait, why the fuck is there two?
1578000	1580000	Oh, I must have missed one.
1580000	1583000	Um, you've never played RuneScape.
1583000	1585000	Don't worry, we're doing questing.
1585000	1590000	My only problem with old-school RuneScape is I think you have
1590000	1594000	to pay the premium experience for premium or we're all just
1594000	1597000	going to get shafted playing that game, like, not in a good
1597000	1598000	way.
1598000	1603000	Um, but yes, Eldon Ring DLC comes out on the 19th and then
1603000	1605000	the multiplayer game for, like, four days in a row.
1605000	1607000	I'm doing multiplayer games.
1607000	1609000	You need to teach me old-school RuneScape.
1609000	1612000	Literally, I just go fishing at the back of Lumbridge.
1612000	1613000	Lummi Castle.
1613000	1618000	Not the back, next to the main bit south of the castle.
1618000	1622000	Um, but I, uh, what was the single word?
1622000	1626000	Oh, probably four days of multiplayer Eldon Ring.
1626000	1630000	And then I have a very unique stream come in with the first
1630000	1634000	collab outside of Vealor at the end of the month with a
1634000	1637000	feature called Sin Sister.
1637000	1641000	And we may or may not have both purchased shock collars,
1641000	1644000	which we will give each other control of the shock collars.
1644000	1648000	And we are going to play multiplayer Eldon Ring and whoever
1648000	1652000	causes us to die, whichever one causes us to die, gets to
1652000	1654000	shock them, basically.
1654000	1657000	Yep, we are, we're doing that.
1657000	1661000	Um, I believe Sheeby is also getting a shock collar, so I
1661000	1664000	might have some sort of stream with her relating to that.
1664000	1670000	Uh, I use the shock collar for FaDempa.
1670000	1676000	Um, but yeah, my goals are pretty much.
1676000	1678000	I want to do a hundred days of my collabs with VTubers.
1678000	1680000	It's like a challenge for myself.
1680000	1683000	I like forcing myself to go talk to people.
1683000	1686000	Like, I was scared of Dempa, okay, but I DMed her first
1686000	1690000	because I'm a big girl and I was like, hi, I'm 20.
1690000	1694000	Uh, would you like to say, I was like, oh yeah, would you like to
1694000	1695000	collab with me?
1695000	1697000	She's like, fuck yeah, oh my god, that was so good.
1697000	1699000	So yeah, Dempa based.
1699000	1703000	Uh, yes, I'm going to put myself out there, talk to VTubers,
1703000	1707000	mingle a bit more because, um, I say my voice is cracked.
1707000	1710000	I said, well, actually you died zap, true.
1710000	1715000	Uh, everything else is explanatory.
1715000	1718000	Uh, I need to actually purchase the Lord of the Ring book,
1718000	1720000	we'll get there, we'll get there.
1720000	1723000	Okay, this I need help with.
1723000	1725000	Um, I actually genuinely need help.
1725000	1727000	I literally have, I don't know if you can hear that.
1727000	1731000	I have pen and paper to write down what you guys think.
1731000	1733000	I don't know what I'm doing.
1733000	1736000	Do I look like, do I look like I'm not smart?
1736000	1738000	Wait, hold on, let me write it down.
1738000	1741000	General, like, sorry, I'm going to look down every time I do this.
1741000	1744000	Art.
1744000	1747000	Old art.
1747000	1748000	Mean.
1748000	1752000	And obviously you flings or waflings.
1752000	1756000	Dempa is intimidating until you realize our tentacles can go.
1756000	1758000	Hmm.
1758000	1764000	You're so, so, so.
1764000	1766000	Keeping, keep them all as help.
1766000	1768000	Okay.
1768000	1770000	Strawing.
1770000	1772000	Oh, that's actually kind of cute.
1772000	1774000	Strawing.
1774000	1780000	Yeah, um, cuddle time.
1780000	1782000	Yeah, I'm, I'll Dempa, I'm with you.
1782000	1784000	Like, I just like straightforward stuff.
1784000	1789000	Gen, like, strong gen, strong gen, strong live, strong clip,
1789000	1796000	strong art, strong old art, strong meme.
1796000	1798000	Straw notes.
1798000	1803000	Straw notes would make sense.
1803000	1805000	Snort.
1805000	1809000	Snort, snort, snort, snort.
1809000	1812000	It's not like what, uh,
1812000	1815000	it's not like what a swan would say.
1815000	1817000	Snort.
1817000	1822000	Uh, general refers to, um, if you just want to say something,
1822000	1824000	like on Twitter, you use that,
1824000	1827000	and then, like, I'll read it with my eyeballs.
1827000	1828000	Straw live.
1828000	1829000	Straw live.
1829000	1832000	Honestly, my voice is cracking now.
1832000	1834000	I'm not gonna make it.
1834000	1835000	I can't believe it.
1835000	1837000	If I can debut and already did,
1837000	1840000	not even 24 hours later.
1840000	1843000	Strong lure.
1843000	1844000	I guess I said.
1844000	1845000	Ink time.
1845000	1846000	Oh my god, ink time.
1846000	1848000	Sorry, ink time for art.
1848000	1850000	That has to be, that's so good.
1850000	1851000	Ink time.
1851000	1852000	Ink time.
1852000	1854000	I like ink time.
1854000	1857000	Yeah, like a reaction tag.
1857000	1859000	Strong sea.
1859000	1860000	Oh!
1860000	1862000	Strong seas?
1862000	1864000	Like I see.
1864000	1866000	Strong leaks.
1866000	1867000	I think ink time is good.
1867000	1870000	Because ink myself is my,
1870000	1874000	my, my other catchphrase.
1874000	1876000	It's not catchphrase at all.
1876000	1879000	Strong memes.
1879000	1881000	Strong memes.
1881000	1882000	Stronetized.
1882000	1885000	Oh, let's do that.
1885000	1887000	The inking.
1887000	1888000	Anything.
1888000	1889000	Oh.
1889000	1891000	Sorry, I'm itching my eyeball.
1891000	1892000	Strong bad.
1892000	1894000	Oh god, I'm so bad at this.
1894000	1895000	Strong close.
1895000	1896000	I mean, just do what DEMPA said,
1896000	1897000	and just, like, strong gen,
1897000	1901000	strong live, strong this, strong that.
1901000	1903000	Ink time was used by a tattoo artist.
1903000	1905000	Man, tattoo artist out here,
1905000	1908000	ruining it for all of us.
1908000	1911000	We dafty, we dafty.
1911000	1912000	I inked myself.
1912000	1914000	Strong Sina.
1914000	1915000	Oh, that's actually really good.
1915000	1916000	Hold on.
1916000	1920000	General text, strong Sina.
1920000	1923000	I'll just do one N.
1923000	1924000	That's so good.
1924000	1925000	I've seen you.
1925000	1927000	Strong Sina.
1927000	1928000	Strong sake.
1928000	1929000	No!
1929000	1930000	No, Vsake.
1930000	1932000	I'll never beat the Vsake allegation.
1932000	1934000	Be for yourself.
1934000	1941000	I think Street 4 would meet fans soon.
1941000	1942000	Mimire.
1942000	1943000	Mimire.
1943000	1946000	It sounds like Namorize.
1946000	1949000	And I have the memory of a goldfish.
1949000	1950000	Incredible.
1950000	1953000	I'll turn out funny.
1953000	1954000	Gen can be strong.
1954000	1956000	You know what?
1956000	1961000	Any mention of my absolutely horrific
1961000	1962000	Strawfish.
1962000	1963000	Stratustive.
1963000	1964000	Strawfish.
1968000	1969000	God, I'm so bad at this.
1969000	1970000	I'll think.
1970000	1972000	I'll need to freaking cook on it more.
1972000	1973000	I don't want to be stuck.
1973000	1974000	Smallfish.
1974000	1977000	Oh, smallfish is really good for all art.
1977000	1978000	Oh, yeah.
1978000	1979000	Smallfish.
1979000	1980000	I'm putting that down.
1980000	1986000	I hate when you have to like TTL.
1986000	1987000	E?
1987000	1990000	Oh, I did too many of them.
1990000	1991000	What's that?
1991000	1993000	I can't read it right properly.
1993000	1996000	Yet my entire career is based on it.
1996000	1998000	Hell yeah.
2000000	2002000	Okay, we'll move on.
2002000	2003000	I'll come back to it.
2003000	2005000	I'll cook a little on my own.
2005000	2008000	Obviously, Squishy Gold pretty much.
2008000	2012000	He did designs, lores.
2012000	2015000	There's actually full lores, Will.
2015000	2019000	I can't read it right now because my voice is perishing.
2019000	2023000	Um, what else?
2023000	2025000	Mascots.
2025000	2027000	All the mascots were made.
2027000	2031000	If you didn't know the reason,
2031000	2034000	I'll heal your throat with your tentacles, please.
2034000	2042000	The reason why reeflings have a patch on their head
2042000	2047000	is a nicotine patch to help you with your addiction.
2047000	2051000	We have an addiction to each other.
2057000	2059000	So that's why you have a nicotine patch.
2059000	2061000	And you have lovely tentacles.
2061000	2064000	I've already got lots of suspicious artwork of us together,
2064000	2066000	but it's for November, so I can't post that.
2066000	2069000	Yeah, Tamachi absolutely cooked on the lores.
2069000	2072000	Background, yeah, I love my room.
2072000	2075000	Odd's Top was such a good sport.
2075000	2077000	I literally sent them a DM.
2077000	2080000	I'm like, hey, can you base it off of Sonic OST?
2080000	2083000	And he's like, yeah, sure.
2083000	2084000	Waltz with me.
2084000	2086000	He did my little banner that's on Twitter,
2086000	2088000	which is really good, absolutely.
2088000	2094000	Azura could help you all with her healing properties.
2100000	2101000	Oh really?
2101000	2103000	Yeah, Small Sushi, she did great.
2103000	2105000	Small Sushi actually, she did fantastic
2105000	2108000	because the girls weren't fully conceptualized
2108000	2110000	when she created them.
2110000	2112000	I basically just gave descriptions,
2112000	2114000	which was really rough.
2114000	2116000	I know you haven't seen my stingers
2116000	2119000	for my scene transitions.
2119000	2121000	I hate stingers.
2121000	2123000	I spent like $200,
2123000	2127000	and I don't even want to use them.
2127000	2130000	I bought it, obviously I bought it for everyone else,
2130000	2133000	but I'm like, why did I spend that money on me?
2133000	2135000	I don't like using stingers.
2135000	2137000	I just went straight into it.
2137000	2140000	And my loading screen was so expensive.
2140000	2144000	Actually, Umi cooked with the loading screen.
2144000	2148000	She's actually making another alternative version
2148000	2150000	because I had to do that cover-up thing.
2150000	2154000	But that was very expensive as well.
2154000	2156000	I just want to get in there.
2156000	2159000	And then obviously why I picked my gen.
2159000	2162000	That was so fun to do.
2162000	2166000	Everyone's like, oh, this is my first impression.
2166000	2168000	No, motherfucker.
2168000	2170000	I picked them.
2170000	2171000	Oh, so fun.
2171000	2174000	It was so fun being able to say that
2174000	2178000	and being like, yeah, yeah.
2178000	2180000	Absolutely adored it.
2183000	2185000	Evil strongy be like, I always use stingers.
2185000	2187000	I love stingers.
2187000	2190000	I love when VTubers have 10 minutes of stream starting soon
2190000	2192000	at the start of their streams.
2192000	2193000	Perish, absolutely perish.
2193000	2194000	Nonsense.
2194000	2198000	I'm starting up on a brotherhood at the menu tomorrow.
2198000	2200000	Mark my words.
2202000	2203000	But yes.
2205000	2207000	It was just fantastic.
2207000	2211000	The girls, it's hard to judge people when they apply
2211000	2215000	because it just felt really...
2217000	2219000	weird.
2219000	2221000	Hold on.
2223000	2225000	Hold on.
2225000	2229000	Yeah, it felt weird trying to put them on
2229000	2232000	because some of them said put me on any model.
2232000	2235000	Some of them said I wanted a specific model.
2235000	2238000	I think Azura got who she wanted.
2241000	2243000	She be...
2244000	2246000	Hmm.
2246000	2249000	Mercy wanted AC.
2249000	2252000	AC wanted AC, so AC got AC.
2252000	2255000	Amy, did Amy say anyone?
2258000	2261000	Anyway, it's impossible to give people the outline
2261000	2264000	that they wanted because they couldn't even see it.
2264000	2266000	They couldn't even see it.
2266000	2268000	It was just an outline.
2269000	2273000	Did you have any awkward or weird applications?
2275000	2279000	Someone's intro video was 30 seconds.
2279000	2282000	For anyone watching, if you're serious about joining
2282000	2287000	a VTuber agency, what you're supposed to roughly do
2287000	2291000	in an application introduction video
2291000	2293000	is to say your accolades,
2293000	2295000	whatever you achieved as a streamer
2295000	2297000	prior to what you're doing now.
2297000	2300000	So you mention how often you stream.
2300000	2302000	Do you stream three times a week consistently?
2302000	2304000	Good thing to mention.
2305000	2307000	30 seconds.
2307000	2310000	It was like, hi, I'm...
2310000	2312000	and I stream on and that was it.
2312000	2315000	And I was like, bro, what am I supposed to do with that?
2317000	2319000	But yeah, you're supposed to say your accolades,
2319000	2321000	what you want to achieve within the agency,
2321000	2323000	is a good thing to mention.
2324000	2327000	You're also supposed to pass the test
2327000	2330000	where you say hi, Valor, at the start
2330000	2333000	because that means you read the instructions properly.
2333000	2336000	If you didn't start with hi, Valor,
2336000	2339000	I didn't close your application right away.
2339000	2343000	I gave you a chance, but it's kind of one of those tests
2343000	2347000	where those who did it, I know you read.
2347000	2350000	Those who didn't, either, you forgot.
2350000	2352000	Although I say that,
2352000	2355000	I mean, the girls have given me permission
2355000	2358000	to kind of talk about the thing.
2358000	2361000	Azura's application was unprofessional.
2361000	2365000	Fuck, I'm not even going to be around the bush with Azura.
2365000	2368000	She gave me permission to talk about it.
2368000	2373000	In her introduction, she was like, hey, I'm Azura.
2373000	2376000	And she was like, I really don't like pickles
2376000	2378000	and I don't like mustard.
2379000	2382000	And I was like, Azura, this is your introduction video.
2382000	2385000	You're supposed to tell me things you've achieved.
2385000	2388000	She's like, yeah, I don't like the taste of these certain foods.
2388000	2391000	And I was like, you're perfect for the hag, and you come.
2391000	2394000	You're perfect for the doting hag
2394000	2397000	that we've got no competition.
2400000	2405000	I say, doesn't even, English isn't even her first language.
2405000	2411000	She had the most professional application.
2411000	2416000	She had these massive paragraphs, serious answers.
2416000	2419000	Amy was a dafty.
2419000	2423000	She freaking forgot to edit one part of her application.
2423000	2426000	And in one of the answers,
2426000	2429000	she was like, I want to diddle the other girls.
2429000	2431000	And I'm like, I knew it was an oversight
2431000	2433000	because everything else was professional.
2433000	2436000	I'm like, any one earth have you put.
2438000	2442000	She failed the high vealure.
2444000	2449000	Mercy must have watched her introduction video
2449000	2452000	like 30 times over.
2452000	2455000	She was so like, she went above and beyond.
2455000	2458000	She actually created Icy.
2458000	2462000	Like recreated her outline and named her and all of that.
2463000	2466000	Pocha, Amy left that on purpose.
2466000	2468000	Yeah.
2468000	2472000	The introduction video gives me a very good hint
2472000	2474000	to what kind of beach over you are.
2474000	2476000	No, what kind of person you are
2476000	2478000	because there's one thing to stream,
2478000	2482000	but when you're talking directly to someone who's assessing you,
2482000	2484000	you act a bit different.
2486000	2489000	And yes, it was very interesting.
2489000	2490000	It was very interesting.
2490000	2492000	I got serenaded so much.
2492000	2494000	So I don't know why I'm frog blinking.
2494000	2497000	Let me just give me one second.
2497000	2500000	She's going to totally not recalibrate in the old mech.
2500000	2502000	Hold on.
2507000	2509000	That's very calibration.
2511000	2513000	Yeah, I got serenaded.
2513000	2514000	So many people were singing.
2514000	2516000	I'm like, you don't have to sing to be in this agency.
2516000	2519000	You just need to do one cover song of it.
2519000	2521000	I'm not going to force you to sing.
2524000	2530000	Probably one of the most frustrating things
2530000	2534000	was we asked to have streaming history
2534000	2537000	and people's evidence of being a streamer
2537000	2540000	was like a link to their Twitter and no other thing.
2540000	2541000	Oh no, content creator.
2541000	2542000	That was the terminology used.
2542000	2544000	You have to be a content creator.
2544000	2547000	And it was like, are you okay?
2547000	2548000	Why are you linking your Twitter?
2548000	2550000	Twitter isn't content.
2550000	2552000	There weren't even a v-tweet or anything like that.
2552000	2554000	And it was just like...
2556000	2557000	Are the girls doing more songs?
2557000	2558000	Yes, 100%.
2558000	2560000	If the girls want to pursue more singing,
2560000	2562000	they just come to me and tell me what they want to do.
2562000	2565000	And I get that she don't.
2568000	2570000	Well, other things.
2570000	2573000	Obviously, I'm not going to say anything private.
2574000	2575000	I'm very flattered.
2575000	2578000	There were some very big names that applied,
2578000	2580000	but they just weren't a good fit.
2580000	2582000	Or they already had a pre-established brand
2582000	2585000	and it was like, is this really what you want?
2585000	2587000	I think you just want to...
2587000	2592000	I think some people that were very high notoriety
2592000	2595000	were interested more in the manager side of things
2595000	2599000	than actually being at the other.
2599000	2602000	We had like one person who was fricking massive
2602000	2605000	and they were like, can I keep my IP and join you?
2605000	2608000	And I'm like, sorry.
2608000	2611000	I need to own the rights to the models
2611000	2613000	in order to do what we need to do.
2613000	2614000	Okay.
2616000	2617000	It was a shame,
2617000	2619000	because I'm sure that person would have done just fine,
2619000	2625000	but it's not possible to not have the IP
2625000	2628000	and utilize the girls.
2629000	2632000	Yes, it was in the facts on the page.
2634000	2637000	The website got so many fucking questions
2637000	2639000	that were answered on the website,
2639000	2644000	so they had to ignore the tab that had all the information
2644000	2648000	to go to the contact part of the website
2648000	2651000	to then ask the question,
2651000	2654000	that was already on the website.
2655000	2660000	Literally, I tried so hard to make that ship
2660000	2663000	be as comprehensible as possible.
2667000	2672000	Yes, I think the applicants definitely read through it all.
2675000	2676000	Reef time.
2676000	2677000	Oh, I can't say that.
2677000	2678000	Sorry, I'm not...
2678000	2680000	That's the code name.
2680000	2681000	I did not say that word.
2681000	2683000	Please don't get on me.
2685000	2689000	I'm just trying to think back
2689000	2693000	because there's anything notable on the applications.
2693000	2695000	Oh my God!
2695000	2697000	There was one application.
2697000	2700000	She was outrageous.
2700000	2702000	Outrageous.
2703000	2705000	If you apply to an agency,
2705000	2707000	that agency watches your content.
2707000	2710000	This girl, my goodness,
2710000	2712000	she applied.
2712000	2716000	I went on her Twitch to listen to her live
2716000	2718000	to check her out and all of that.
2718000	2723000	She admitted in the next live stream,
2723000	2726000	oh, I'd only do Vialure for one year
2726000	2730000	and then bring my audience over to this account.
2730000	2733000	Why would you admit that out loud?
2733000	2735000	I'm very happy to see it.
2735000	2737000	I never even considered her,
2737000	2740000	but oh my God, how could you be so...
2740000	2743000	I don't even know what the word is.
2743000	2745000	I was gobsmacked.
2745000	2747000	I sent it to other members of the team
2747000	2751000	to make sure I heard what I heard was correct.
2751000	2753000	But they outright said,
2753000	2756000	yeah, I would just do it for one year
2756000	2758000	and then bring my audience over.
2761000	2762000	Dog.
2762000	2765000	Thank God I didn't waste.
2765000	2768000	Waste a slot for you.
2768000	2772000	I am very happy to say that all current talents
2772000	2775000	have given very high indications
2775000	2777000	of staying at the agency, you know,
2777000	2781000	as long as income is all good and dandy.
2781000	2783000	So please do support them via Patreon
2783000	2786000	or monetization streams when the girls get monetized.
2786000	2789000	But yes, I was absolutely gobsmacked.
2789000	2792000	One to even apply to do it in the first place
2792000	2794000	knowing you have no commitment,
2794000	2797000	knowing that we're like 80, 20 split,
2797000	2799000	everything's in your favor, 100% merch,
2799000	2804000	and saying that you're not even going to be, like, dedicated.
2804000	2805000	Oh my God.
2805000	2808000	And then to admit it,
2808000	2810000	to admit it,
2810000	2812000	knowing you submitted yourself and the agency
2812000	2814000	is watching over you.
2814000	2818000	Oh my God.
2818000	2820000	Absolutely gobsmacked.
2822000	2824000	Oh.
2824000	2826000	Anyway,
2826000	2828000	I will repeat again,
2828000	2830000	I am very happy to say that all girls
2830000	2833000	have given indications of long-term commitment,
2833000	2835000	if you will.
2835000	2837000	And as well as,
2837000	2839000	if they sign on for one more year,
2839000	2841000	like another year,
2841000	2844000	the split goes 85 to them,
2844000	2846000	15 to the agency,
2846000	2849000	and they also get an alternative outfit on us.
2849000	2852000	They do not pay for it, we pay for it.
2852000	2855000	I'm glad she was honest, I didn't waste her time.
2855000	2857000	She was honest in her stream,
2857000	2860000	she was not honest on her application form,
2860000	2863000	to fill all of that out in mislead and be like,
2863000	2865000	I'm just going to quit after a year,
2865000	2867000	just go,
2867000	2869000	I actually spat in real life
2869000	2871000	and that landed on my phone.
2871000	2874000	Don't do that, don't fuck with me.
2874000	2877000	I put a lot of love into this.
2877000	2880000	Women lie, I can't believe it, that's terrible.
2880000	2882000	You know you can't say that,
2882000	2884000	that's the concept artist by the way,
2884000	2886000	don't believe the thing that comes out of his mouth.
2886000	2888000	I'm jealous of the phone.
2888000	2891000	I didn't know she was going to do that bit
2891000	2894000	on her debut, where she was like,
2894000	2897000	I gasped, I was like, oh my god.
2897000	2899000	Just so you guys know,
2899000	2901000	I didn't have anything to do with her debuts,
2901000	2903000	they all did it themselves.
2903000	2906000	I was like, oh my god.
2906000	2908000	Anyway,
2908000	2910000	oh,
2910000	2913000	2.0's over, right, show's over folks.
2914000	2916000	Um,
2916000	2919000	I'm a bit jealous.
2919000	2921000	Right, I'm going to open up Marshmallow
2921000	2923000	because this time I can answer a question.
2923000	2925000	Please keep my UKatha on.
2925000	2927000	I don't know what letter did it,
2927000	2929000	but I can actually answer Marshmallows that are,
2929000	2931000	um,
2931000	2933000	why are you so cute? Stop it,
2933000	2935000	my voice is so freaking broken.
2937000	2940000	Have you considered streaming elsewhere?
2940000	2945000	Yes, the girls are allowed to stream on an alternative website
2945000	2946000	at a later date.
2946000	2947000	Please understand,
2947000	2949000	we are trying to establish yourself on YouTube at first,
2949000	2951000	and we have monetization on YouTube,
2951000	2953000	and the girls' income is all sorted.
2953000	2955000	But yes, there are plans.
2955000	2958000	I will make it free access.
2962000	2965000	I do not believe in charging any further
2965000	2967000	than, um,
2968000	2971000	YouTube membership and Patreons all together
2971000	2975000	at $9.99 for your OSHI desk to support,
2975000	2979000	because it is $1.99 for emotes
2979000	2982000	to make sure no one gets gifted membership.
2982000	2985000	And then is it $4.99, or is it $3.99?
2988000	2990000	My voice is broken.
2990000	2993000	Is it $4.99 for membership?
2994000	2996000	Usually.
2996000	2999000	Is $4.99, yeah, $4.99 seen agreeable.
2999000	3001000	Okay, $1.99 for tier one, $4.99.
3001000	3003000	Yeah, that sounds right, that sounds right.
3003000	3005000	Um, as long as you guys don't think it's outrageous,
3005000	3007000	like in this day and age.
3007000	3010000	Um, as I've said in the Veil or Smoothstream,
3010000	3013000	we are undercutting the market.
3013000	3016000	Um, I'm not even going to pretend otherwise.
3016000	3018000	On the VA side of things,
3018000	3022000	most VA's start at $10 for two exclusive audios.
3022000	3024000	We are undercutting the market by doing
3024000	3026000	four audios for $5.
3026000	3029000	And no price increase at all is planned.
3029000	3031000	And if you feel ever so inclined,
3031000	3034000	you can donate more via, donate.
3034000	3036000	You can support more via Patreon.
3036000	3042000	There is a secondary tier that is $20, I believe.
3042000	3045000	I haven't put anything else in place.
3046000	3048000	Um, yes.
3049000	3051000	What's your history with hypnosis?
3051000	3053000	I'm learning, I'm a new baby.
3053000	3056000	Um, but I'm going to give it my best shot.
3056000	3059000	I have a very deep interest in it.
3059000	3063000	I've just never actually made content about it, like, straight up.
3063000	3066000	It's not expensive, yes, I...
3074000	3076000	Oh, I really, I've heard some stories
3076000	3081000	around that it was going to be $5 for standard and $20.
3081000	3084000	Oh, no, no, we're undercutting the market.
3084000	3089000	$5 and you get four, four audios per month.
3089000	3093000	Um, are you concerned undercutting could cause a scene?
3093000	3095000	Wide price shift downwards?
3095000	3099000	No, because prices are going up everywhere.
3099000	3105000	Um, following the voice actress trends
3105000	3109000	and the ASMR side of things and the role play side of things,
3109000	3112000	prices are only going up and I believe in the opposite.
3112000	3116000	I believe in delivering both quality and quantity.
3116000	3119000	Um, without overworking the girls, please understand
3119000	3125000	that management have dictated the scripts for a couple of months.
3125000	3129000	However, there's few girls interested in writing their scripts.
3129000	3132000	I'm also very open to writing scripts live.
3132000	3134000	Unfortunately, there will be a membership stream.
3134000	3138000	For me, content-wise, to give you guys exactly what you're looking for.
3138000	3142000	Um, but please understand, I cannot pigeonhole the girls
3142000	3145000	into doing the same thing over and over again.
3145000	3149000	Just rehashed, that's not, that's not, um,
3149000	3153000	that is no way for them to be set up for success.
3153000	3157000	That is, they will be set up for failure, sadly, if I did that
3157000	3159000	and I really hope, uh, yeah.
3159000	3161000	Have you written any scripts yet?
3161000	3163000	Yeah, you listened to them.
3163000	3167000	Everything that's out right now on Patreon is done by me.
3167000	3173000	The two other script writers kick in, I want to say roughly in three months
3173000	3179000	and then the manager for the scripts is about to kick in.
3179000	3185000	I don't know quite what's happening yet, if they'll write the majority.
3185000	3191000	Um, this is just my humble opinion, but because I don't have...
3192000	3199000	My scripts do not come out as best as if a man had written it.
3199000	3201000	That's just my opinion.
3201000	3206000	Um, the Emmy has shown interest in a script,
3206000	3209000	Shibi has shown interest in writing.
3209000	3212000	I think Azura prefers the help.
3212000	3217000	Azura, um, I think she needs reassurance.
3217000	3222000	AC is good at improv.
3222000	3226000	Uh, I think she may do some improv scripts in the future.
3226000	3228000	Uh, yes.
3230000	3233000	What is the adult aspect to the agency?
3233000	3239000	Uh, the alternate, alt-twitters and, uh, Patreon.
3239000	3241000	Yeah.
3241000	3243000	Azura did good.
3243000	3245000	She did.
3245000	3250000	I eventually want to be a member for all the girls who girls deserve their fans.
3250000	3253000	Uh, yeah, I'll kind of repeat this.
3253000	3257000	If you, like, are in a position where you can support, like, one girl,
3257000	3262000	please think about supporting the other girls over me.
3262000	3267000	Um, I am living a very good life, um, and things are going very well.
3267000	3270000	Please don't worry about me, okay?
3271000	3276000	How do you find the alternate of twitters?
3276000	3279000	Check who they're following?
3279000	3282000	Yeah, check who they're following.
3282000	3284000	Question about your design.
3284000	3286000	How did you come up with the twin tails?
3286000	3288000	And the candy piece is seashells!
3288000	3291000	I'm a cuttlefish, I'm a sea beacherber.
3291000	3296000	Uh, these are cuttlefish, uh, sorry, these are seashells.
3296000	3299000	Uh, and then I got double bunches.
3299000	3304000	Um, I love symmetrical hair, and I love bunches, so I got double bunches.
3309000	3314000	Um, would you be open to accepting script submissions?
3314000	3317000	Absolutely, I don't know how to set it up, I don't know how to do it,
3317000	3321000	and I don't know, I need, I would need to, like, give a guide,
3321000	3331000	because it's quite hard behind the scenes to get it all efficient and good to go, but yeah.
3331000	3333000	Definitely open to it.
3333000	3337000	Please do let us cook though, like, literally the dust is settling,
3337000	3341000	the girls are about to start doing game streams after these 2.0s.
3341000	3348000	Um, the first week I did request the girls to stream as much as they're physically able to
3348000	3353000	without cancelling streams, I have emphasised to them that cancelling streams,
3353000	3361000	try your best to not over promise, it's better to take a day off than it is to
3361000	3366000	um, plan a stream that you think you can do and then you get too tired and cancel it,
3366000	3373000	because cancelling streams is very, people plan, people plan their time and their days
3373000	3376000	and their energy around a stream if they know what time it's coming on,
3376000	3381000	and it's very valuable to respect people's time.
3381000	3386000	So, like, for reeflings, for example, you guys know that I don't stop streaming,
3386000	3392000	like, at all, and I'm always there, and I literally have never cancelled a stream, so.
3392000	3395000	And that's true, I haven't cancelled a stream.
3397000	3398000	Mm-mm.
3398000	3402000	Um, sorry to tie it, just to bring the topic back.
3402000	3405000	Gifted membership is the one that's closest to $5, yeah.
3405000	3407000	You may have to go higher.
3409000	3410000	Eh, eto?
3411000	3416000	I thought gifted membership went to the lowest tier, tier one was gonna be emotes only,
3416000	3419000	and then tier two was gonna be $4.99.
3419000	3422000	Ah, I really don't wanna overcharge.
3423000	3424000	So there is gonna...
3430000	3432000	Well, wait, more streams?
3432000	3434000	Yeah, I stream all day every day, baby.
3436000	3437000	Just make it an extra dollar.
3437000	3440000	Eh, it's expensive though, it's expensive.
3441000	3442000	Eh, who goes there?
3443000	3444000	By the Pope.
3444000	3445000	Identify yourself.
3447000	3448000	Um...
3462000	3472000	I literally said in the interview, you're not gonna get in trouble, I'm not your mum.
3472000	3474000	I couldn't give less than two shits what you do.
3474000	3480000	I basically said the only thing I ask you not to do is release any NDA content,
3480000	3486000	and, you know, don't say the N word.
3486000	3488000	You know, basic adult stuff.
3488000	3490000	It's pretty much it.
3490000	3493000	I mean, I don't know what else to tell you.
3493000	3496000	When you treat adults like adults, they act like adults.
3496000	3497000	It's crazy.
3502000	3505000	Did you hypnotize the girls to become the characters?
3508000	3510000	Eh, I hope you're drinking a lot of soda.
3510000	3511000	Ah, I'm going cola.
3511000	3513000	It's fizzy juice, actually.
3513000	3514000	Sorry, you're turning Scots.
3514000	3517000	It's not soda, it's fizzy juice.
3518000	3520000	Um, yes.
3523000	3528000	As for repercussions, like I said, we don't do suspensions.
3528000	3530000	However, I did warn them.
3530000	3532000	I said, doesn't mean you're allowed free reign.
3533000	3535000	Like, we can cut, we can terminate.
3535000	3537000	Obviously, we don't want to do that.
3537000	3540000	And no girl has given any indication of any of that shit.
3540000	3542000	Thank God.
3542000	3544000	I have full faith in these girls.
3544000	3545000	I've known them for two months now.
3545000	3546000	No issues.
3546000	3548000	Not one issue has popped up.
3552000	3555000	Oh, yeah, fizzy juice is how you say it in Scotland.
3556000	3558000	Are you a hire up in the agency?
3558000	3559000	No.
3559000	3561000	I said, don't call me boss.
3562000	3568000	I basically got their script started,
3568000	3570000	but it's going to a script manager.
3570000	3572000	And I don't have to do any work.
3572000	3574000	I get to stream all day long.
3576000	3577000	Um...
3581000	3583000	Yeah, someone kind of asked about Gentoo.
3584000	3585000	A year away, bro.
3585000	3586000	A year away.
3586000	3588000	Do you plan on doing movie watch alongs?
3588000	3590000	Absolutely.
3590000	3592000	Well, you ever do a deep sea creature list?
3592000	3594000	Oh my God, yeah, that's so good.
3594000	3595000	That's a good idea.
3595000	3596000	I like that.
3596000	3598000	I was going to...
3598000	3600000	So this is a failed stream idea.
3600000	3603000	I was actually going to order, like, a cuttlefish.
3603000	3605000	It wouldn't be alive,
3605000	3607000	but I wanted to explore the biology of it
3607000	3609000	because I think they're pretty cool.
3609000	3611000	Like cephalopods are pretty cool.
3611000	3613000	And I wanted to, like, show you guys, like,
3613000	3614000	there's a thing.
3614000	3616000	If I was a cuttlefish, I'd say, look, looks good.
3616000	3618000	But I think people would find it a bit more
3618000	3620000	that I'm, like, essentially playing with a dead body.
3620000	3621000	So...
3621000	3623000	Yeah, probably can do that.
3624000	3626000	I've not played Subnautica.
3626000	3628000	I don't have a memory of playing it.
3629000	3632000	Could give it a good shot.
3632000	3634000	I could recommend it.
3637000	3639000	But it's for science.
3640000	3642000	Cephalopog!
3642000	3644000	For memes?
3644000	3646000	For memes?
3646000	3647000	Cephalopog.
3647000	3648000	Sorry.
3648000	3649000	My tag now,
3649000	3651000	as long as no one's yoinked it.
3651000	3652000	Hold on, hold on.
3652000	3654000	Let me scroll up so I can see the spelling.
3655000	3658000	Thank you!
3658000	3660000	Yoinkers!
3660000	3662000	My tag now!
3662000	3664000	Which tags are missing?
3664000	3666000	I've got strong Sina for general.
3666000	3668000	I've got smuttlefish for all
3668000	3670000	and cephalopog for memes.
3670000	3673000	So I need live clips and art.
3677000	3678000	Cracked it.
3678000	3681000	Literally didn't even have to come up with it myself.
3681000	3683000	What a genius.
3684000	3686000	Hee hee.
3687000	3689000	Let me refresh my...
3689000	3691000	I scroll down a bit, actually.
3703000	3704000	As long as they're respectful,
3704000	3706000	I'll actually use it for educational content.
3706000	3708000	Yeah, I like biology,
3708000	3711000	but I think people find it quite morbid sometimes.
3712000	3715000	I don't want to upset anyone.
3715000	3718000	I can't believe you're already taking advantage of me.
3718000	3719000	True.
3719000	3721000	You like it, really?
3721000	3724000	I've missed taking advantage of you.
3724000	3726000	What a refund.
3730000	3732000	Tentacles.
3732000	3734000	I don't have any tentacles.
3736000	3738000	I may get tentacles another time,
3738000	3740000	but I don't have tentacles.
3740000	3742000	I feel like if I had tentacles,
3742000	3744000	they would come out with my...
3746000	3747000	I'll be honest,
3747000	3749000	I don't think they would be tailbone attached.
3749000	3752000	I think they would come out with my other end.
3760000	3761000	Out of all the girls,
3761000	3764000	who do you think is going to overwork themselves for Sheebie?
3764000	3767000	Sheebie's already done so much work in advance,
3767000	3769000	so she can focus on streams.
3770000	3771000	Um...
3779000	3782000	The tentacles not be around you.
3788000	3792000	Oh my god, someone took the Scottish coffee pasta.
3792000	3795000	What do you think of that, Mr. Pajama wearing
3795000	3798000	basket face, slipper wielding...
3798000	3799000	I hate...
3799000	3802000	The only thing I don't like about Marshmallow
3802000	3805000	is that it cuts words in the middle.
3805000	3806000	Like...
3808000	3809000	Tentacles.
3809000	3811000	Ooh, that became cool.
3812000	3814000	Do any of the girls have any talents,
3814000	3816000	which is a surprise to you?
3816000	3818000	Emmy, please, piano for real, for real.
3818000	3820000	Um...
3821000	3823000	Mercy...
3823000	3825000	has acting.
3825000	3827000	Um...
3829000	3831000	Is there a draw?
3831000	3833000	Sheebie actually draws as well,
3833000	3835000	and Mercy and Emmy,
3835000	3837000	and A.C. Doodle.
3837000	3839000	Um...
3839000	3841000	I think they all draw,
3841000	3843000	and I'm like, fuck Nella.
3843000	3845000	These are all talents, and what do I do?
3845000	3847000	I just sound like a backpipe.
3849000	3851000	Hipstone, like, that's good.
3852000	3853000	Um...
3853000	3856000	Will the talents keep their silver playbots?
3856000	3858000	Of course, Jesus, why would I keep that?
3858000	3860000	That's disgusting.
3860000	3862000	Absolute disgusting behaviour.
3862000	3864000	All their hard work, and I keep the playbutton.
3864000	3866000	Absolutely not.
3871000	3873000	Oh my God, someone said an hour ago,
3873000	3875000	when will auditions be open for Gen 2?
3875000	3877000	I am hot and ready like a little
3877000	3879000	Caesar's Pizza.
3879000	3882000	Come and scoop me up before a rich man does.
3883000	3885000	I've spotted an American...
3885000	3887000	Bevin' on.
3887000	3889000	Um...
3889000	3891000	Mimi on reflex.
3891000	3893000	Oh my God, I need to make a reflex...
3893000	3895000	post...
3895000	3897000	on my alternate arm.
3897000	3899000	My voice is so loud.
3899000	3902000	Mummy, thank you for giving me a little sister.
3902000	3905000	You talked prior during the selection process
3905000	3907000	about keeping a list...
3907000	3910000	a list of possible candidates,
3910000	3913000	so I got my first choice for everyone.
3913000	3915000	I don't know how,
3915000	3917000	but everyone was like first choice pick.
3917000	3919000	I wanted them in the agency, they came in the agency.
3919000	3921000	There were...
3921000	3923000	I would say like...
3923000	3925000	eight people...
3925000	3927000	that were like...
3927000	3929000	all back.
3929000	3931000	Obviously Azura didn't have one,
3931000	3933000	that was a problem.
3933000	3935000	Emmy, I was actually really worried
3935000	3937000	she wouldn't accept her board.
3939000	3941000	She likes it.
3943000	3946000	I was worried that she wouldn't accept the board.
3946000	3949000	And she was like, yeah, that's fine, I don't care.
3949000	3951000	I was like, okay, then jeez, jeez.
3951000	3953000	I was worried she wouldn't accept that.
3957000	3959000	Have any Japanese carpo's influenced
3959000	3961000	your decision making?
3961000	3963000	Why do you believe there was
3963000	3965000	no lid one before?
3967000	3969000	No idea.
3969000	3971000	Probably because
3971000	3973000	you need someone who's done it
3973000	3975000	before to even understand
3975000	3977000	what to do.
3977000	3979000	A lot of guy owned corporations
3979000	3981000	in the nicest way,
3981000	3983000	most likely haven't been streamers before
3983000	3985000	and don't comprehend what you're asking
3985000	3987000	people to do.
3987000	3989000	I kind of spoke about this a wee bit
3989000	3991000	in the last stream.
3991000	3993000	That 80-20 split,
3993000	3995000	in order to motivate people,
3995000	3997000	you have to let them earn what they're worth.
3997000	3999000	If you turn around and say to them,
3999000	4001000	for every $100
4001000	4003000	you're getting
4003000	4005000	20 bucks out of it, you're getting 50 bucks out of it,
4005000	4007000	all that girl
4007000	4009000	is going to be doing is sitting there
4009000	4011000	saying, oh wow,
4011000	4013000	I could have made the full 100 on my alt account.
4013000	4015000	Oh wow, I could have done this on my previous life.
4015000	4017000	That's all that they're going to sit there
4017000	4019000	and think.
4021000	4023000	We're talking pure business, baby.
4023000	4025000	I'm happy to talk pure business if you want.
4028000	4030000	Well, the monthly audio releases
4030000	4032000	be revealed before the month starts.
4032000	4034000	Yes, we need to
4034000	4036000	get on top of that.
4036000	4038000	Sadly, there was a few issues
4038000	4040000	production wise
4040000	4042000	with a few things.
4042000	4044000	Surprise, surprise, turns out,
4044000	4046000	takes a lot of time to make these things happen.
4046000	4048000	Love artists, but my fucking god,
4048000	4050000	can you not go over deadlines?
4050000	4052000	That'd be great.
4053000	4055000	But yes, we
4055000	4057000	will be posting monthly
4057000	4059000	what the tags are,
4059000	4061000	what the title is.
4061000	4063000	We just need to catch up.
4063000	4065000	You need to give us time to breathe.
4065000	4067000	I'm so sorry, all I can ask is your patience.
4067000	4069000	Unironically, bow emoji
4069000	4071000	because
4071000	4073000	we need time.
4073000	4075000	It was absolutely hectic
4075000	4077000	on debut.
4077000	4079000	We were exhausted in that group collab
4079000	4081000	and
4081000	4083000	I don't know if you recognise
4083000	4085000	how fast we ended.
4085000	4087000	I was like, right, say bye to chat, bye.
4087000	4089000	We all
4089000	4091000	disappeared out of that voice call so quickly.
4091000	4093000	I was like, thank you guys so much.
4093000	4095000	I'm going to wait a pass out.
4095000	4097000	And then I ended up being really sick after it.
4097000	4099000	But yes,
4099000	4101000	we just need things to calm down.
4101000	4103000	We're going to ease into the first week.
4103000	4105000	Everyone's got their games. You get to see their personalities
4105000	4107000	more, enjoy them more, which is fantastic.
4107000	4109000	We know that.
4109000	4111000	And
4111000	4113000	octopus.
4113000	4115000	I'm not an octopus.
4115000	4117000	I'm a cod-o-fish.
4117000	4119000	No call me octopus.
4119000	4121000	No call me squid.
4121000	4123000	I'm a cephalopod
4123000	4125000	or a cod-o-fish.
4125000	4127000	Better take your yourselves.
4127000	4129000	And now the things have calmed down.
4129000	4131000	The lead up to debut is very nerve-wracking.
4131000	4133000	Like, very, very nerve-wracking.
4135000	4137000	I have finished my cola.
4137000	4139000	I will now start on
4139000	4141000	my warble.
4147000	4149000	Astronaut, you're so friggin...
4149000	4151000	Hey, you like my teeth?
4151000	4153000	Is that what I was doing it for you?
4157000	4159000	I think I've caught up a little bit.
4159000	4161000	I don't know.
4161000	4163000	I lied.
4163000	4165000	Is there a reason you went with YouTube over Twitch?
4165000	4167000	Yes, I can manage the girls' accounts from YouTube.
4167000	4169000	I cannot manage the girls' accounts from Twitch.
4169000	4171000	I can't do a thing on Twitch,
4171000	4173000	management-wise.
4173000	4175000	And
4175000	4177000	Twitch, unfortunately,
4177000	4179000	are very sparse and arbitrary
4179000	4181000	when they
4181000	4183000	throw the old ban hammer down
4183000	4185000	or suspension hammer down.
4185000	4187000	Really not a fan of Twitch doing that.
4187000	4189000	Every week you see
4189000	4191000	a girl being like, Twitch with a heck.
4191000	4193000	I'm literally doing everything
4193000	4195000	that everyone...
4195000	4197000	I'm doing stuff that everyone else does.
4197000	4199000	Like, it just...
4199000	4201000	At least with YouTube,
4201000	4203000	you can beg them on Twitter
4203000	4205000	for help or whatever.
4205000	4207000	Twitch is inconsistent, yeah.
4207000	4209000	Let's see.
4209000	4211000	Would you dominate
4211000	4213000	Inkling?
4213000	4215000	I've never played Splatoon.
4215000	4217000	Isn't it actually good?
4217000	4219000	It's probably the most lore-friendly
4219000	4221000	game for me to play.
4223000	4225000	How does managing accounts...
4225000	4227000	Yeah, so I have a...
4227000	4229000	It sounds really bad, but I don't do anything
4229000	4231000	on their accounts, but
4231000	4233000	I can basically go on their accounts
4233000	4235000	and set up streams for them
4235000	4237000	or approve comments for them.
4239000	4241000	Anything they want to help out, really.
4241000	4243000	Now that
4243000	4245000	debuts have happened, the girls are
4245000	4247000	going to be controlling all that stuff.
4247000	4249000	They'll be doing their live streams and stuff,
4249000	4251000	but in order to reduce as much
4251000	4253000	stress as possible on the girls,
4253000	4255000	I pretty much try to do every single
4255000	4257000	little thing, but
4257000	4259000	now that we're past the debut stage,
4259000	4261000	they're going to have to be big girls
4261000	4263000	now and, you know,
4263000	4265000	put up their little games,
4265000	4267000	put up their streams
4267000	4269000	and all that and update their description.
4269000	4271000	Like, I was the one doing
4271000	4273000	all that behind the scenes.
4275000	4277000	Have you played Pokémon? Yeah, Pokémon Ruby.
4277000	4279000	My childhood game.
4279000	4281000	Um...
4281000	4283000	Mudkip was my starter.
4283000	4285000	They have to spread their big girl wings.
4285000	4287000	Yes, I like putting a message in the
4287000	4289000	Discord. I'm like, I'm so sorry girls,
4289000	4291000	but the hand holding kind of
4291000	4293000	slows down now.
4293000	4295000	Um...
4295000	4297000	Oh yeah.
4297000	4299000	Say hello out.
4299000	4301000	It was torturing.
4301000	4303000	Blaziken is so strong
4303000	4305000	and so is Mudkip. Mudkip's really strong
4305000	4307000	as well.
4307000	4309000	Mudkip's always used in speedruns
4309000	4311000	for Pokémon Ruby or Emerald.
4311000	4313000	She doesn't know
4313000	4315000	I want to collect her ink. Oh my god.
4315000	4317000	Inks on you.
4317000	4319000	Strony is mum a bird, but it's time for them to flee the nest.
4319000	4321000	Honestly, like,
4321000	4323000	um, I hope
4323000	4325000	overall they feel like less stressed.
4325000	4327000	Like, um...
4327000	4329000	They didn't have to think
4329000	4331000	about the lures or what they wanted to say.
4331000	4333000	Everything was edited on their behalf.
4333000	4335000	Like, they had to give the audios over,
4335000	4337000	everything was done on their behalf.
4337000	4339000	Because like, I've heard stories
4339000	4341000	of, like, other
4341000	4343000	agencies, like,
4343000	4345000	go to the talent, right, make up your lure.
4345000	4347000	We've ordered all the art, but you make up the lure, by the way.
4347000	4349000	And it's like, what?
4349000	4351000	You literally are handing me the model. What do you mean you've not
4351000	4353000	thought this stuff? And it was like, quick
4353000	4355000	come up with a description of your character really quickly,
4355000	4357000	quickly, quick, quick!
4357000	4359000	And it's like, what?
4359000	4361000	You're giving me the model.
4361000	4363000	What do you mean I come up with this stuff?
4363000	4365000	Like, that's the whole point of the model, unless it would be customized?
4365000	4367000	Like, it's just like, fuck.
4367000	4369000	Um...
4369000	4371000	How did you
4371000	4373000	end up managing them? Or are you new to the agency?
4373000	4375000	Well, I'm new to being a manager. I'm not even their manager.
4375000	4377000	I'm just a streamer that does it alongside them.
4377000	4379000	I just picked them!
4379000	4381000	But, but me?
4381000	4383000	Me? Nah, I'm on Assassin's Creed.
4383000	4385000	I'm fucking being a boss. I ain't doing
4385000	4387000	shit.
4387000	4389000	Um...
4389000	4391000	Yeah.
4391000	4393000	Um...
4393000	4395000	I know this isn't...
4395000	4397000	Someone said it! Someone said say
4397000	4399000	Purple Burglar Alarm! Got it!
4399000	4401000	I knew someone was going to say it. I always
4401000	4403000	get asked this. Right.
4403000	4405000	So in my, like, clear accent,
4405000	4407000	I say Purple Burglar Alarm.
4407000	4409000	But if I say it in a harsh Scottish accent,
4409000	4411000	Purple Burglar Alarm?
4411000	4413000	Like, my tongue gets caught
4413000	4415000	on the top of the roof of my mouth. Wait, I'll mute
4415000	4417000	my background music so you can really hear it.
4417000	4419000	My tongue gets caught.
4419000	4421000	Purple Burglar Alarm?
4421000	4423000	Like, ooh!
4423000	4425000	Purple Burglar Alarm?
4425000	4427000	You can hear my tongue getting caught.
4427000	4429000	Say it, huh?
4429000	4431000	Hmm...
4431000	4433000	Uh-uh...
4435000	4437000	Sorry, Paul.
4439000	4441000	Uh...
4443000	4445000	What did you miss? Nothing.
4445000	4447000	It's just me memein' about...
4447000	4449000	Are you all trying to keep non-conflicting
4449000	4451000	schedules? Sadly, it's not
4451000	4453000	possible when someone like me is on the team.
4453000	4455000	Um, so whenever
4455000	4457000	a gen mate of mine goes
4457000	4459000	live, I will highly recommend
4459000	4461000	you go watch them. Cause right now, for example,
4461000	4463000	Shiba Cottenbom is live doing her 2.0.
4463000	4465000	Uh, Azura is coming
4465000	4467000	on in roughly three hours.
4467000	4469000	Um, but sadly
4469000	4471000	I am an endurance streamer
4471000	4473000	and the best time slot that I have selected
4473000	4475000	means that I can go to doctors' appointments
4475000	4477000	even if I do. Um... No, I'm not dying!
4477000	4479000	Before anyone freaking types that
4479000	4481000	I'm fine, my health is good.
4481000	4483000	Um...
4483000	4485000	Uh, it's all good. Don't worry.
4485000	4487000	Um, but the time slot
4487000	4489000	I have chosen means that I can still go out
4489000	4491000	to do things like go shoppin
4491000	4493000	or to a doctor's appointment
4493000	4495000	or, um,
4495000	4497000	you know, go feed gammy, you know how it is.
4497000	4499000	I'm not dying!
4499000	4501000	Stop! My health is so much better.
4501000	4503000	Although I do have a sad story.
4503000	4505000	I mean, I won't say it in 2.0
4505000	4507000	even though it's just
4507000	4509000	our wealth.
4509000	4511000	Nah, nah, I'll keep it to myself cause it's a bit sad
4511000	4513000	and I don't want to make you guys sad.
4513000	4515000	Like, this is such a good happy time. Like, holy fuck, we're back.
4515000	4517000	Um, after a year
4517000	4519000	goddamn, that took so long to cook!
4519000	4521000	But we're here!
4521000	4523000	Strongly cut.
4523000	4525000	Me, that's just my name.
4525000	4527000	Admitted, that's just my name.
4527000	4529000	Um...
4529000	4531000	But yeah, sadly I am an
4531000	4533000	Endurance streamer which means
4533000	4535000	weekly I will most likely have very long streams
4535000	4537000	that are not
4537000	4539000	friendly to the majority of viewers.
4539000	4541000	Please understand, do not feel
4541000	4543000	bad.
4543000	4545000	If you are unable to watch me
4545000	4547000	live.
4547000	4549000	The other girls
4549000	4551000	might be much more accessible to you
4551000	4553000	time zone wise or stream wise.
4553000	4555000	I can still hear her
4555000	4557000	fuck!
4557000	4559000	But I play, I absolutely
4559000	4561000	do not feel insulted at all
4561000	4563000	if you cannot
4563000	4565000	you know, keep up with me.
4565000	4567000	I'm not very friendly, my time zone
4567000	4569000	isn't friendly, I am aware of that.
4569000	4571000	And cause I'm an Endurance streamer, like, tomorrow's stream
4571000	4573000	is literally
4573000	4575000	8 hours long.
4575000	4577000	I'm not even kidding. We're doing the full play
4577000	4579000	through of Assassin's Creed Brotherhood
4579000	4581000	and then we're going back to 100% it
4581000	4583000	cause I've never 100%
4583000	4585000	in the DNA sequence since Assassin's
4585000	4587000	Creed Brotherhood before. Like, that's what
4587000	4589000	we're doing the next day.
4589000	4591000	What do you mean? I thought you were just debuting.
4595000	4597000	So yeah,
4597000	4599000	that's why
4599000	4601000	whenever a gen mate
4601000	4603000	goes live, please, you are more than welcome
4603000	4605000	to tell me. I will direct
4605000	4607000	you guys to the gen mate cause I can't
4607000	4609000	redirect cause my stream, my gate
4609000	4611000	if my stream isn't over.
4611000	4613000	So full play through
4613000	4615000	first day is planned, yes, and then 100%
4615000	4617000	the next day, I don't know how long it's
4617000	4619000	gonna take, but yeah.
4619000	4621000	8 hours isn't
4621000	4623000	gonna be the norm every single stream
4623000	4625000	so like, for example,
4625000	4627000	for example
4631000	4633000	needy streamer overload
4633000	4635000	is
4635000	4637000	2 hours long, I think.
4637000	4639000	I've never played the game before
4639000	4641000	I think it's just a click simulator
4641000	4643000	type thing. I'm not sure.
4643000	4645000	I've also got
4645000	4647000	however, actually
4647000	4649000	James Cameron's
4649000	4651000	avatars an 8 hour
4651000	4653000	stream, sorry.
4653000	4655000	Old school
4655000	4657000	RuneScape is like 12 hours, oh god.
4659000	4661000	These are all so long.
4661000	4663000	I need to make up for lost time.
4663000	4665000	I need to make up for lost time.
4667000	4669000	Not to mention, once I get
4669000	4671000	membership, once I get monetized
4671000	4673000	I'm also doing membership streams
4673000	4675000	on top of all of this.
4677000	4679000	8 hour stream on Saturday
4679000	4681000	and then
4681000	4683000	I'm trying foreign sweets.
4683000	4685000	It is gonna be like a
4685000	4687000	like a desk
4687000	4689000	camp. Oh, yeah.
4689000	4691000	Oh, you get to see my desk, man.
4691000	4693000	When do you
4693000	4695000	rest?
4695000	4697000	I will rest until I'm dead.
4697000	4699000	I've waited a year to be here.
4699000	4701000	I have lost time to make up for.
4701000	4703000	People have waited
4703000	4705000	in cryo freeze for me for a very long time.
4705000	4707000	And the way I say
4707000	4709000	thank you is
4709000	4711000	rather than saying thank you
4711000	4713000	is like doing it through content, through ASMR,
4713000	4715000	through collabs, through everything.
4715000	4717000	So, yeah.
4717000	4719000	I'm
4719000	4721000	making up for it. Oh, no.
4721000	4723000	Someone says
4723000	4725000	don't burn out, please.
4725000	4727000	I have a secret for you.
4727000	4729000	I have this thing, your honor.
4729000	4731000	It's called rautism.
4731000	4733000	And it means I actually don't
4733000	4735000	experience burnout.
4735000	4737000	I don't experience it.
4737000	4739000	I basically
4739000	4741000	go to sleep and wake up the next day
4741000	4743000	and I'm ready to take on the world again.
4743000	4745000	I've never really felt
4745000	4747000	what burnout is, the way people describe it.
4749000	4751000	I think
4751000	4753000	my autism has given me a buff
4753000	4755000	and
4755000	4757000	means I don't get burnout.
4757000	4759000	And I'm very excited to stream every single day.
4759000	4761000	It's a superpower.
4763000	4765000	Yes, for the foreign sweet stream,
4765000	4767000	again, that's hand cam.
4767000	4769000	You'll see my hands. So, if you don't like VTubers
4769000	4771000	that can show
4771000	4773000	a wee bit of the flesh. Do apologize.
4773000	4775000	I might not be for you. However, do have
4775000	4777000	gen mates that are a little shy
4777000	4779000	and I don't think they'll show themselves.
4779000	4781000	So, please be patient.
4781000	4783000	I'm autistic.
4783000	4785000	Don't send me a picture of my face
4785000	4787000	with the hat right now.
4787000	4789000	So, I can make it my twitter
4789000	4791000	profile picture right now.
4793000	4795000	I need to make it my twitter profile picture.
4797000	4799000	Strontism.
4799000	4801000	Strontism is...
4801000	4803000	Oh, should that be my life tag?
4803000	4805000	Because I don't get burnout.
4805000	4807000	Strontism.
4807000	4809000	Oh, that's really bad though. I feel like
4809000	4811000	you're making fun of autism. I'm like
4811000	4813000	one shut the fuck up. I literally
4813000	4815000	have sweaty hands and feet all day long.
4815000	4817000	Like, fuck you.
4821000	4823000	You gotta throw a swirl at them.
4823000	4825000	Swirl at them.
4825000	4827000	I like that hypnosis swirls. It's like this thing
4827000	4829000	you swirl on a desk and then you're like
4829000	4831000	strontism.
4831000	4833000	Life tag strontism.
4833000	4835000	Okay, okay, okay.
4835000	4837000	I can blame you guys if someone's like
4837000	4839000	oh my god, you're making fun of autism.
4839000	4841000	Shut the fuck up.
4841000	4843000	Anyway, I don't think anyone's
4843000	4845000	going to watch me that's like that anyway, so.
4847000	4849000	Never seen a work horse.
4849000	4851000	Ooh.
4851000	4853000	I guess it's even better than this
4853000	4855000	when the memberships come out.
4857000	4859000	Strontism is...
4859000	4861000	shit in Dutch.
4861000	4863000	Ain't no way.
4863000	4865000	Ain't no way I name
4865000	4867000	myself Kaka in Netherlands.
4867000	4869000	Netherlands.
4869000	4871000	Netherlands Praten.
4871000	4873000	Nee jong.
4873000	4875000	Ik snap het niet.
4875000	4877000	Ik snap het niet.
4877000	4879000	Ik heb namen.
4879000	4881000	Wait, I forgot all the Dutch in the world.
4881000	4883000	My name
4883000	4885000	is
4885000	4887000	Merda. That's terrible.
4887000	4889000	I have autism too. Oh my god, autism gang.
4889000	4891000	Gang gang gang gang.
4891000	4893000	Got the Patreon.
4893000	4895000	Yeah.
4895000	4897000	Did you like my Patreon audio? Did you like the demo?
4897000	4899000	It was so weird.
4899000	4901000	Like hearing
4901000	4903000	hearing the
4903000	4905000	the Scots.
4905000	4907000	You know what I'm saying.
4907000	4909000	The demo audio was good.
4909000	4911000	Aw, thank you.
4913000	4915000	Eh.
4915000	4917000	You didn't tell us you could speak Dutch.
4917000	4919000	Nee, ik kan niet.
4919000	4921000	Was it
4921000	4923000	Ik leer Netherlands
4923000	4925000	on dat
4925000	4927000	Ik heb
4927000	4929000	I had
4929000	4931000	Netherlands
4931000	4933000	Mensen, Vrenden,
4933000	4935000	Vrijden. That's German.
4935000	4939000	I basically used to play Call of Duty with some Dutch folk.

5142640	5147080	That's right ladies and gentlemen, I was the one who
5147960	5154000	Judged you if you're a beach over worthy enough to get in the agency, and I've literally streamed for less than two months myself
5154720	5156720	I
5157120	5164000	Absolutely terrible. I shouldn't talk about that. I'm sure there's some people really really pissed that didn't pick them. Sorry. I was your barrier
5164800	5167120	But please understand we also took into
5168160	5170160	Someone can have the perfect voice
5171040	5173040	Okay, I'm fine. Ah
5174200	5178840	Go away. I get scared. I get scared when management show up. I'm like
5179000	5181000	Oh
5181320	5186680	Leave me alone. Oh, my voice is cracking. Oh crap so much professional
5187320	5189800	Big well, right? Let me refresh your questions
5193000	5196240	I want you to strong my cuddles until I
5197360	5200600	That's such a good sentence. Oh my god
5204240	5206240	What do you think of sunken gallery
5208840	5210840	Not convinced
5214120	5216920	Such operation I know I know I know I know
5217960	5220200	Was that the melody of legend of zelda?
5232520	5234120	Um
5234120	5240040	Will you get multiple endings there's multiple endings I've never played I actually don't know much about the game
5240280	5242680	I thought it was like you click buttons. That's all I know
5245000	5249720	That you click buttons you'll never get I'm really good at clicking buttons, you know what I'm saying
5251320	5253320	They're all bad endings. Oh, no
5254280	5257240	They're multiple. There's tons of endings. I thought it was like one of them quick games
5257400	5259400	I
5262200	5267880	How did you end up getting to pick the talent when you're just new to the agency is there
5269880	5271880	Because I'm the creative director
5275240	5277240	I'm the creative director
5280600	5284600	Good ending is when you get your meds. No, oh, maybe take your meds
5287480	5291080	And the voices go away, no
5292920	5296440	I don't want to play elton ring and then take my meds because then you guys all disappear
5298680	5303000	Oh my god, do you remember that time we played elton ring and we all like
5303560	5308200	We're mimicking something and then someone came in and went bang bang and blew us all up
5312360	5316600	How big is the vealer team, I mean it depends if you want to count contractors as well
5317960	5321080	It gets pretty juicy if you want to count contractors
5321560	5325880	Like we've literally got like four more technical clippers coming in. No
5327400	5336440	One person's about to be on trial two are like we want them full-time basically. Um, so that adds more people to the website
5338360	5342200	Do you count the talents as well? That's another six then technically
5342920	5349880	If we disappear who will stream side. Oh, oh, yeah, one of you guys have to come in as the baddie. Wait, what's happening with my arm?
5350680	5352680	Oh, what's happening with my arm?
5354200	5356040	Oh
5356040	5359960	No, I'm gonna have to know you about that a little bit. It's a bit too aggressive
5362520	5365240	Are there any big group projects? Yes. Oh my god
5366760	5369720	There's such big group projects. I'm so tired
5370600	5376360	I planned ahead I planned every month. There's gonna be some sort of event going on at the allure
5377960	5379960	Um
5380280	5382520	Leave my noodle on. I don't know why my arm breaking
5383960	5389080	I'll annoy nari about it. Nari was absolutely fantastic when she came to construct in me. She's fantastic
5389320	5390200	Um
5390200	5391640	You plan on getting 3d models
5391640	5394680	Yes, but you're gonna have to put your money where your mouth is if you want to see the girls 3d
5394680	5398520	Put your money where your mouth is give them memberships. Go on the patrons because
5401080	5404760	It's expensive because I we would have to buy them the trackers as well
5405240	5408600	I actually don't know much about 3d in yet, but I'm pretty sure like you can
5409320	5413800	Be our chat model and we can all like touch each other and stuff in there
5414520	5416520	And we put you
5419800	5423320	Will there be group audios yes, there will be group audios and
5424280	5427080	There's already one-on-one audios planned with each other
5427240	5434200	But I didn't know the comfortability level of the girls when we were like at that stage of development
5434520	5437560	So so far it's azura and sheepsters
5438680	5440680	me and mersey and
5441000	5443000	emmers and icers
5443320	5446280	I've not done anything further. I think donathan rewards
5447000	5450680	Will most likely be targeted at that stuff and it'll be access
5451480	5453160	free to access
5454040	5461240	Because I think public donathan rewards are much more satisfactory. Obviously we will have to do the classic
5462360	5465240	like first place second place third place and because
5465880	5467880	We do need to incentivize and
5469000	5471000	Azura and
5472440	5476040	Might be in the position to move out if all goes well and she gets the support
5477160	5479560	Like monetary like gets monetized and
5480200	5484280	All that jazz and if she can move out she can definitely increase her like stream times for you and
5485400	5487400	Just find a easier tang
5487960	5492040	That's why I'm kind of like support the others because like they're in positions where like oh if I could move out
5492040	5495640	I could definitely meet more content stream for longer do this. Do that be more like, you know
5496520	5498520	So definitely support that okay
5499720	5502360	Can I drill it in your head anymore to support them or?
5504200	5506200	Then you like hypnotize you
5509880	5513400	Oh, my picture's on twerp right, okay, I'll get that. I'll update it
5521240	5523240	Oh, no the
5524280	5526280	A veal or house would be awesome, actually
5526360	5531320	And no the girls are like some of them are like still living with family or
5532200	5537720	And so they can't really be like oh like, you know all the time so
5538680	5540680	Yeah
5541720	5547080	We obey we support the girls, but you kindly support the girl. So yeah, um
5550520	5552360	That is why
5552360	5553880	um, so
5553880	5557880	Azura's up first for donathan rewards to kind of give you an idea and
5559320	5565480	I'm opening to you know farting about and being open to like kind of the stuff you guys would like to see
5566360	5568360	Perfectly fine with me no problem
5571000	5573000	Um
5574040	5578280	Are the audios on patreon already done do you mean like edit?
5580120	5581240	Um
5581240	5582840	Only one month
5582840	5585000	It's been done. So like june is done
5585800	5592120	So the girls responsibilities like contract wise is three streams a week if health permitted. Oh my god
5592680	5595240	If health permitted I got asked by one of the girls
5596120	5601880	I'll just Azura was like, do I need to give you a doctor's note if I'm sick? I'm like, no
5603000	5604200	Go rest
5604200	5606440	My goodness, if you're not well, you're not well
5607240	5608120	um
5608120	5614840	So if they're in good health, they are to stream a minimum of three times a week and monthly four audios
5616120	5620200	I definitely do not want to overwork anyone. I do not want them to feel stressed
5620280	5622280	I want them to have good times good vibes
5623160	5625160	happy ending
5625800	5627400	Yeah
5627400	5629400	And they've been like super
5629800	5632920	Patient and like the behind the scenes stuff going on
5640440	5644760	Do you talk often with one each other? Yeah, we're in a we're in a discord. We talk every day
5646520	5649080	For two months we've like literally talked every day. Um
5650200	5651800	You know some
5651800	5654520	Some girls like might feel like awkward around each other
5655080	5659080	We had like a couple of gaming sessions leading up to it. We had mock streams together
5659480	5663080	I like wholeheartedly feel 100 comfortable around these girls. Um
5663720	5668200	Like when it comes to collabing with other vtubers outside the agency, unfortunately
5668760	5671320	For me personally, I'm quite inappropriate and
5672040	5676360	If I don't know the person and I don't know their comfort level. I'm not really interested in like
5677000	5680840	Asking for like, oh, you want to do a vtuber club type thing? Um
5682600	5688120	So, uh, I'm probably not going to do too many clubs out with the agency unless like the girls vouch for me
5688600	5691880	Or something like I'm I'm happy to make friends with their friends
5692360	5696920	But um, it's probably going to be solo content majority on this channel
5697720	5701800	And such like content featuring the reeflings when we play our multiplayer games
5702760	5704040	um
5704040	5706040	Yeah, I
5707320	5709320	Um, there is a
5709720	5716040	Notification discord if you go on the other's twitter. It's notification only the talents are not inside it
5716760	5718760	the talents
5720920	5723960	Sorry, my voice is like proper feeling it right now
5724920	5726680	um
5726680	5731320	Yeah, management don't have access. Sorry contractors don't have access to the talent
5732280	5738040	Talents aren't in the notification discord. There's no way you can groom us. We groom you
5740440	5742920	Why am I freaking frog blinking?
5746680	5748680	It's me has probably not set up my parameters
5753400	5758760	One thing get more stable with the group discord for watchers to be joined on the table
5759480	5762840	What are you saying? I don't have no idea what you just said to me
5764840	5769640	Will you hang out say together outside of the collapse? I don't even know if we're gonna have time
5771000	5776040	Like collabs are probably just going to be us meman and like catching up unironically. Um,
5776680	5778680	Amy's very pumped for
5779080	5784680	Minecraft server in july is when that comes out my uh group minecraft server
5785480	5787240	and
5787240	5791160	I the last time I really properly prolified minecraft
5791720	5794280	And this is going to set a few views back. Um
5795640	5803880	The last update was the plant pots were released and I think witches were released and I like never even play that
5804200	5806200	properly beyond that
5806200	5808200	So that'll be interesting
5809400	5812040	Um, I don't really understand anything beyond it
5813720	5815720	um
5818200	5823640	I think I had to stroke right in that the way I'm stroking right now, baby. Oh stop. Oh my god. Oh
5826200	5828200	That's for later, okay
5828440	5830840	I'm gonna look in this direction because I think maybe my
5832280	5834280	arm doesn't bend that way
5835240	5837000	um
5837000	5841160	Yeah, Amy's like really excited for me. I don't really know what you're supposed to do in the minecraft game
5842120	5846120	Yeah, because according to the cycle video. Oh wait, should I be on?
5846840	5848840	Uh chats on the wrong side if I'm looking this way
5850360	5853000	Fang on this ring. Maybe a lord friendly
5854840	5858280	Oh, sorry, I actually didn't mean that for once. Sorry
5859640	5864600	Hold on. I'm looking chat. Excuse me. Oh my hair's in the way. Right. Well, let me put chat

5925720	5929320	You don't pick the wait, you don't pick the oh she the oh she picks you
5930360	5934120	Because it's like you never you don't know like you you can give so many v-tubers a try
5934600	5937720	And then it's just like one you latch on to and you can't get away from them
5940440	5943160	Where the things they're not hard for seashells
5943480	5949960	Isn't it obvious they're seashells like they're transpiring you can see my little hair through them as well if you like look really hard
5951880	5955320	Why am I not feels hold on a minute got talk this girl
5955720	5963240	Oh, but I'm still cut off. Stop. I'm not being bullied. I'm being bullied by the youtube studio right now. You know what?

5965160	5970600	Kind of can you like kind of see the back of my hair through the sea like it's transpired their shells
5971720	5977880	They're pearlescent shells in my hair. I still have bunches behind it. Like I have I have hair bubbles

6002600	6007000	I love when models do that neck thing where they only like disappears
6007800	6013880	It's like the best part like when there is like so much that goes into like picking a model and stuff

6534200	6537800	10 minutes fly by what about infinite time? True
6538760	6546280	Um, I'm like, um, can I leak my like other stream plans for the rest of the week for the month?
6546280	6548520	And I'm like, I'm trying to remember what games I've put down
6549400	6552200	And I've already forgotten them all but they're good games
6552440	6558760	So we're gonna do old-school runescape consistently for a little bit because I want to get 99 fishing
6560360	6563560	Uh, no, not fishing wrong one 99 cooking because I'm a whammin
6567880	6570120	Do do do do do do do do do do do do
6571400	6573560	And that's actually real
6573560	6574360	true
6574360	6575160	um
6575160	6579240	So I'm gonna try my best horror games. I have a bad heart
6580040	6583800	I don't do pause my heart is fine. I got it checked
6584360	6586360	I have to go in if there's any issues. Um
6587640	6593560	I I can play horror games. It's just ill advised. I would probably do it as like a
6594120	6596120	a reward
6596120	6602280	without giving the game away oh I know a game I'm playing next week are you guys
6602280	6610560	ready I'm playing Skyrim full achievements next week because I know
6610560	6613160	how to get full achievements in that game because I've done it a few times
6613160	6621400	before and obviously Skyrim belongs to the North thank you very much I'll be
6622360	6630080	Stormcloaks yep don't care what they say you know I'm all for Talos
6630080	6638520	praise be to Talos so that's my duration game for next week is Skyrim
6638520	6646080	first I believe it takes me just over 24 hours to do full achievements and we
6646080	6649880	kind of you kind of cheat at the start because you do if you do the
6649880	6654200	companion's quest line first and then go back to the save before it so you're
6654200	6661520	not a werewolf and then do the vampire quest the problem I don't know if it's
6661520	6672880	gonna be a problem if I use an Xbox pass for it because because my Xbox would
6672880	6683120	break so many times trying to play Skyrim because the save file issues and I
6683120	6687840	if it's gonna be the same way then there's a strategical way to get full
6687840	6691600	achievements via the Xbox I already know how to do it I've done it a few times so
6691600	6694880	don't worry I'll lay it all out for you baby I'll show you how to get full
6694880	6698880	achievements in Skyrim and under 24 hours that'll be my challenge in under 24
6698880	6704040	hours I'm sure you can do it under way less but I don't know the strats I'm not
6704040	6706360	a speedrunner
6708360	6714920	yes I had a girl ghost me because I told her you picked stormcloth what why
6714920	6718960	would anyone pick the legion sorry but the elves can perish you're no coming
6718960	6723040	into my home country being like no you're not allowed to praise Talos
6723360	6733360	excuse me you can get a little bit of casual fantasy or racism don't mind me
6733360	6739960	absolutely I'm stormcloth all the way don't care don't care don't care I know
6739960	6742400	I'm right
6742400	6755600	being team instinct and Pokemon go because if you always follow your
6755600	6760640	instincts you'll get there in the end and ironically I'm team instinct oops I
6760640	6765240	don't know what you guys are in Pokemon go but I'm team instinct and then the
6765240	6768840	mom was like if you always if you follow your instincts you'll always win
6768840	6773520	because it doesn't mean you have to win or lose just follow how you feel and
6773520	6781400	life is good because team mystic is for like wise people and then team red I
6781400	6789240	forgotten their name is like for for like like I must win people I'm like now
6789240	6793400	I'm just here for the journey I'm just here for the good time thank you
6793760	6798120	whoa instinct was the only one that seemed to lack a stick up their bum
6798120	6809200	excuse me where are we placing sticks team ball of valor oh my god be a lure
6809200	6818240	and Pokemon go collab let's go wait did I read it wrong if I read it wrong
