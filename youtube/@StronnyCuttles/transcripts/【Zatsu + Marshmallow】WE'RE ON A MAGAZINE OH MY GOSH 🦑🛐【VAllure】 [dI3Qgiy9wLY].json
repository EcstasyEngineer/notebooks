reason at all oh my god I she tired I had a nightmare and it was awful I woke up covered in sweat that was quite the sleeping session let's not happen let's not do that again okay body do I make myself clear okay vealor is the first agency of its kind horn dogs on me what did you why did you choose vealor instead of remaining independent Azura and Azura said I saw a great opportunity and vealor entrusted in our vision the support a company can give its talent is a great starting point oh thank you Azura really you're far too kind but how important was the amount of freedom with content creation being open to discussing pls etc for you I don't really want to discuss my pl but I'm happy that I get the freedom to talk about some aspects of life even when wanting to create new memories and the future for myself oh sure that's so kind of you I'm glad that you enjoyed that uh we're an agency that doesn't acknowledge your fucking brand new out the out the out the package okay thank you Azura I appreciate that and what platform did you want to make content on prior to being a part of vealor Azura since I originally streamed on Twitch I wanted to make the move to youtube and continue making content there including shorts and I actually speaking of shorts Azura sorry to interrupt you I've just ordered four shorts of you right now okay I'm just waiting on an asset and there's four shorts coming they're quite humorous okay okay strong thank you yes actually she calls me stroney as in minna stroney like she didn't go stroney she was stroney and it's fucking amazing love you Azura oh I'll keep calling you stroney then since you love yeah yeah thanks Azura okay sorry to interrupt you back to the question uh as content there doesn't entirely get removed after a few days like twitch box okay thank you Azura okay but what inspired you to create content or content in general for that matter Azura I've always had a feel for voice acting and always wanted to take part in some kind of way the many voices that approached me were compliment towards my voice and how I should pursue it which piqued my curiosity in the air however the many voices claimed my voice is extremely erotic oh so when the opportunity appeared it felt like it was meant to be oh wow I agree with that I am sure people did compliment you I have no doubts about that Azura I absolutely no doubts at all um is there any content you're particularly interested in making well that would be the awesome raw place oh Azura all right I also look forward to being in other opportunity oh is that a hint to the video game Azura Azura is that a hint to the video game I don't know by the way before anyone's like oh new viewer here I thought stroney was a mix of strong and funny oh um for anyone who's like uh did you look over the girls answers and stuff uh I think I fixed one sentence and it was in mercies that's it I've not changed any all these answers are what they actually said I fixed one sentence in mercies which I actually didn't tell her about sorry mercy yeah fuck you stroney that's not what you sound like anyway well double fuck you then right whoa whoa whoa sit down sit down whoa I'm fighting myself here okay stop stop okay uh do you have any uh other content creators advice on how to navigate uh creating uh alternative content on the internet especially when it comes safely navigating it because I miss the word safely there if it's a view tubing related and you wish to keep your identity private try not to share too much information that could put you at risk for but it's perfectly okay to be honest and do things that make what don't oh don't force your side I fucking can't read in my own interview yeah is there are you okay do you need glasses you know you're the fucking I'm putting my glasses on okay hold on right glasses are on right everything's enlarged I can actually see no Azura just I'm fucking made that up hold on me fucking neglects Azura I'll let her it this is the lore oh it steady on right uh don't force yourself to do things that make you uncomfortable and the rather open up slowly okay I'll open you up slowly Azura thank you uh right what was the next question uh what do you hope to bring or change in the view tubing landscape Azura I don't think I can change much of anything but I would hope that people can see more person of color talent in the image oh I like that thank you thank you for fucking ego stroking the other I didn't even have to ask for that oh this cup of tea you know what reflens sometimes I make a mead cup of tea all I'm saying is that when we do the meet up I'm making everyone a cup of tea I'm gonna be I'm gonna have a little trolley and I'll be like coffee or tea and there's only one real answer honey tea I know she's like literally all the girls were stroking the bealer I'm like god damn I didn't even have to prompt them oh thank you very much AC did you enjoy your your gorilla guild wars two stream I wonder why she wanted round two of that stream hmm yeah I wonder that the only thing I know about AC's previous guild war stream is she got a train ran on her uh hmm I wonder why she wanted to play it again with the snowberries truly a mystery hmm yes yes that's right dad as we did it again I knew you fucking did it I knew it I knew it haunted deep thank you for becoming a member I knew you did it again there is no way you guys weren't gonna do it again you know what she's gonna do that innocent little feral polar bear is gonna go offline and do you know exactly what I know exactly what she's doing right now I'm sorry but she fucking enjoys that too much someone clipped her and I saw it and she's like burst out laugh and when you'll start jumping on her and I was like yeah die okay innocent honestly look she's my baby girl okay she my she my doll face she my doll face mm-hmm okay we're currently reading Azur's interview from a acapella media look at them I just revealed a bit of secret lore about um the uh design uh the promotional artwork this was ordered before the designs were finalized because look Azur doesn't have her nails painted and one of the biggest giveaways is her headband if it has floating jewellery that's actually uh that's actually a massive giveaway on if uh the artwork was completed or not at that point um they forgot about the jewellery on their toes oh yeah actually yeah that was another big thing so you can tell what stage of panic in production we were at depending on what the thing was but now everything's made correctly um oh oh my god the tea is steaming up my glasses I forget glasses steam up okay I've had my tea right back to the questions uh Azur can I keep question yet of course Stroney okay thank you Azur um right what's one thing you want people to remember about you individually or as a generation I may not be the first but I started with almost nothing I did the best I could and achieved very little I just want to show others that it's very possible and you shouldn't give up I still have a long way to go yes um I I think me and Azura are completely on the exact same page when I say this um I see a lot of potential in Azura which is why she's Azura um you know I I see myself and the girls to different degrees and Azura was definitely and I don't think this is an insult in any way I think she completely 100% gets what why I say this I think Azura is the the version of me that I see that I needed a helping hand or a gating hand and once you know things settle down and everything I'm going to try and get her moved out with her donathon that's coming up next month which is actually really exciting it comes up in August I'm going to try and get her moved out and then things can kind of I think it's upwards and onwards for Azura after that the underdog yes I I I'm a sucker for my underdog I always root for them and I think Azura has insane potential she just needs a few things to occur and then I I think she's got it she's absolutely she's got nothing to worry about um but we just need to first get her moved out and then I can just nuke her brain on all the secrets and behind the scenes stuff okay my little pad of one yes uh right um what do you want to represent in the v-tube sphere Azura I'm not I just I know I'm just another voice but I want to do so much more with that voice I always thought my voice was very no it's not I Azura I picked you because you said I need more gold in your goddamn voice I was about to cross off your damn stream you're a league player you but maybe I can find something that can truly represent in the beach on the sphere yes um Azura humble max and literally I everyone knows why I picked them I told them I said it on debut and I told them like one on one like hey this is why you got picked or type thing um now you have to remember this is the first time Azura has ever been in any kind of spotlight kind of had this attention so please don't be afraid if the girls may have said something that wasn't the kindest to themselves they're not all confident you know they can't all be just absolutely arrogant like myself um so if you see if you see a reply and you're like oh that's a wee shame just remember these some of these girls have never achieved anything close to what they've achieved in the very first month of the very first month at Vilaura they have not achieved that and they're at their time as a content creator so very yes we will grow and blossom their confidence just as the beautiful nasturtiums blossom you know stroney you're just being truthful to yourself as an arrogant okay one more question for Azura and we have finalized Azura's interview mm-hmm uh Azura is there any event in VTubing history that is incredibly significant to you there isn't one that particularly stood out to me but I suppose seeing the rise of Vilaura already coming out with the person of color talent right off the bat was incredibly nice as well as management being open to more person of color designs behind the scenes and developments was very reassuring it wasn't a publicity stunt now I have a oh boy do I have some information about gen 2 to leak to you motherfuckers uh yeah you're not ready for what occurred yesterday with the development team oh boy right that is uh beautiful Azura Dooley please do uh find her youtube channel in the link in the description below you can subscribe check out her shorts I will be getting her new short she's the next batch of shorts and then it goes to Sheebie and then we're rotating all over again because a few of the shorts editors uh have exams etc so I'm having to rotate gracefully between each girl to try and give them a fair amount of shorts um but we're not quite there yet but thank you so much for that interview Azura that was fantastic you may go and rest for your stream today which is probably League of Legends because you're fucking addicted uh okay uh oh thank you Strony Minestrone soup oh thank you no Azura you're so thank you for being my mummy quite literally my mummy well thank you for being my mummy hey hey Azura stop it you got me blushing i'm reading stuff right out you go out you go right thank you thank you right who's next oh icy snow paws speaking of the snowberries who do we have up next she's not streaming the day oh yeah piss right that's not good icy snow paws our the feral polar bear of the allure uh again the do you want to know how you can tell this art wasn't finalized notice how icy doesn't have any fluff coming off of her hips design there's no fluff coming off of her little hips uh this was made again before the designs were like fully fleshed out and finalized and it was utter chaos trying to get this dang right okay says you strong but how do you how do you okay uh icy and you come and you come oh thank you for having me on stream i just finished a fucking hell icy you're really rushing the day i don't know what happened to my accent what the fuck okay well anyway and never mind that right let's ask you some questions sorry okay um okay dada is thank you for running a trade i see no interview today okay interview vealor is the first agency of its kind why did you my little icicle choose it instead of remaining independent um i already had a previously good experience with them and from that day why does it sound like a zero i always for fuck hold on let me pull up ac right now hold on let me pull up ac stream so i can fucking mimic tear her right now hold on pause pause the interview you'd be quiet just for a week second ac okay my darling what the fuck yeah no it's fine it's fine it's fine right debut highlights hello everybody hi it's so good to see you hello i already have a pretty a previously good experience with the investor and from that day i always had a good impression of her so when i heard of the plans she was making i wanted to take part of it so much because i knew i'd feel safer under her wing and the concept of vealor i'm trying just to appeal the last to me being an indie was also very lonely to be in a group of girls that are degenerates like me i'm not right though like working all together to reach her dream sounded like the perfect place for me oh that's so lovely ac i'm so glad that you feel comfortable around us all being degenerates okay for the next question my little icicle how important was the amount of freedom that content creation being open with your pl etc was for you it was pretty important it was it make me nervous and overwhelmed if i had to rethink everything i say in fear of getting in trouble for it okay i just like to be comfy and to talk about whatever without worrying about that stuff oh i'm yeah no it honestly it's fine i'm not gonna pretend that you've never streamed before ever in your life okay i'm losing it's almost like i'm losing my mind hearing all these voices um okay uh what platforms did you want to make content on prior being on vealor my little icicle pretty much all of them are the known ones like twitch and youtube and twitter and patreon et cetera all right okay okay what inspired you to create content or just content in general for that matter hold on i need to refresh oh my name is icicle i have always done things on the creative side or have many ideas i wanted to bring to life seeing the things that people would create or do puts a fire in me you know what else is in her today the fucking dad does stop running a train oh my god thank you back to you ac that's far wait hold on what's your voice again it's no pause that's far to want to try and create those things myself everything expires me from music to art to poems to movies to animation god damn ac you pull from a love inspiration um are we sure stroney is a cut official not apparent do you have any advice for other content creators to navigate the field safety be careful with how much you share of your identity it sometimes makes you feel off or uncomfortable oh if something makes you feel off or comfortable don't engage with it and in general just don't do the 18 plus content if you think you might regret it later uh she really said if you're born a slag be a slag ac oh my god right okay uh you might regret later once it's on the internet it's there forever i would only advise going into it if it's something you're very passionate about and should enjoy want to do it long term oh my god ac you're hilarious oh my god right what do you hope to bring or to change in the v-trip and landscape well we've all seen 3d concerts like the big ones where people can watch in person it is my dream to achieve something similar but in a form of a 3d 3d dj party with all of the violor oh that's fucking adorable she actually did say this in her application to us um i'd make for such a cool thing to experience with more interaction dancing and lots of fun oh she's so cute she put this in her application i really made it stand out because now if anyone's lurking that just happens to have applied you know there's a lot of reasons obviously again it was like 64 candidates the one model so it wasn't easy but um 3d dj party madness no no no no no no no every strongy streamer's like i'll have a viola reading it now um what was this one oh yeah um like some people didn't really have much goals or aspirations etc they're just like i'm just happy to do my thing and i was like that's good and all but it was good to have like a someone come in with like a really strong goal like this is what i want to achieve like she's got something to work towards which is quite nice uh but i say i'm not finished uh asking you the question so what do you want to represent in the v-tribe sphere and just for those of us at home how does your voice go in? tarot polar bear from tarot polar bear it's a bit tough for me to think of that because i don't think there's anything i really represent besides myself oh you're so humble the closest thing i can think of is to represent is being yourself the most authentic version of you is the ideal version the right people will see that in you even if you take some years i had i'm losing it i had many nights where i cry oh hey so what the fuck i had many nights where i cried or was worried that i'm not it's not going to happen but it did and now i'm here and i'm the most fulfilled i've ever been yeah after that stream don't give up yes i see you're very fulfilled right now thanks for that dad as i see you there what's one thing you want people to remember about you individually or as a generation i think what i'd like people to remember about us as a generation is that even if we are a whore all of the girls have a lot of personality they are talented they're sweet they're incredible people that deserve to achieve their dream and i also think that it'd be sweet and a bit funny that the corpo with the horse is the one who ended up being the most wholesome and entertaining what oh my god i see i can't believe you said that i lied her pushers win honestly v sucky dub honestly okay last question for you i see and then you can retire for the evening after your very uh exciting gaming session early okay last question for you my my darling is there an event in vitra being that is incredibly significant to you hmm i can't see oh wait that's that's my voice i can't say that there is i kind of just always focused on the things i am doing and what i wanted to but i wouldn't say any of them because a huge significant part for me what the fuck oh it's more like did i skip a sentence it's more like reading the news and being updated about what's going on in the vitra being world oh icicle that's fantastic i think i skipped a line there i wanted to achieve but there's a lot of big things that happen but okay thank you so much icicle you may go rest i'm sure you're uh absolutely aching in a certain location of your body but that's fine it's fine okay who's up next on the chopping block thank you for that interview thank you bunny go good night uh yeah yeah that's virginia wherever as you see thanks uh let me hold on let me get let me fill up and make so i can pretend i can do her voice holy crap she's impossible for me she is genuinely impossible for me what is this is this a wanted poster for me and she's not wanted oh i'm so sorry and then hold on and it's so close to my cabin too it's so close to my cabin too what the heck what the heck i'm so sorry emmy this is the best i got this is the best i got i'm sorry the masochistic little sis i'm so sorry emmy this is this is all i got as for her artwork i think she was actually correct design wise yeah she was actually correct design wise at this point emmy was the first to be produced and nailed basically uh oh the hammer no yeah no she's got a hammer and all that and then that's her bit colder on the other side yep uh looks good to me i think uh emmy's uh came out was like right okay right hold on yeah we nailed emmy first okay well you know i guess i can use this to problem oh gosh that's such a lame voice uh vealor is the first agency was came why did you choose instead of remaining independent some of the jupy companies have a track record of being unreliable wink wink if you know you know and i knew i'm so sorry i can't do your voice and i knew this wasn't gonna happen here stop i need some like creams for fucking sonic heroes so uh obviously my name is emmy bezu so my parents name me bezu some feature for companies have a track record of being unreliable wink wink if you know you know and i knew that wasn't gonna happen here so sorry this is awful so it was either i was joining this company or none at all it's fucking cream it's actually cream from sonic heroes i'm so sorry emmy i can't do it i was i was doing okay independently i was just lonely and struggled to keep up with my friends and now i'm forced to keep up with them i can't hang i love the girls and she literally put xd oh my god i shouldn't hang out to save her the cringe but it's fine i'll a little bit emmy eh i'll a little bit ac without the accent works top priority i wouldn't top priority i wouldn't no what the fuck why can't i emmy after the japanese word for emoto after the japanese word for emoto how important was oh for goodness sake i'm sorry i think i'm gonna have to make emmy scottish i'm just gonna make emmy like scottish i think how important was the amount of freedom emmy uh about content creation about being open up to discussing pl's top priority i wouldn't be here if they didn't allow me to be open about my pl it is not her voice at all um right like scottish also wait that's deep also have a lot of rules sound stressful always worrying if you did something wrong i'm just doing creams from sonic here i'm sorry emmy emmy rose team rose always worrying if you did something wrong or said something against the rules uh yeah uh pretty much hi i'm new here i'm currently mimicking my gen mates and i literally can't do anything you want timo is timo the one with the accent i just accepted yeah literally emmy went to scotland on her break oh my god confirmed eh what platform do you want to make content or what can't what platform did you want to make content on prior revealer um i made content on twitch and tiktok and instagram and twitter and youtube and patreon prior fucking hell you've got you're stacked out of the wazoo obviously most of it was just reposting stuff from one platform to the other to reach a brighter audience okay thank you emmy um but what inspired you to create that kind of content okay what is pl means previous life so um other kind of personas you might have made content under etc like again when you join veal or you get a whole new persona given to you eh what made you inspire inspire to make that kind of content they listened to a lot of blue dot i mean did you actually put on an interview you did well this is published okay i also consumed a lot of erotic literature so i had a lot of fun creating my own scripts too okay that's actually the same i never thought i'd actually be creating it because i naturally sound like the erm actually about t which is the least sexy thing imaginable but that's where the voice acting comes into play i know i i didn't know you voice acted for krema sonic heroes so i mean here we are um is there any content you're particularly interested in making i want to make more art i just have to find the time and energy and some inspiration you heard your pen pals you heard your big bros gi or some inspiration off you pop scotch accent brought you here and this stream is all about not being scotch well i'm just reading their interviews and then i'm like doing my default voice do you have any advice for other content creators i want to safely navigate the 18 plus field just hide your identity and don't become close personal friends with the people that consume your content it just gets too dangerous okay so keep yourself safe please wow you really do sound like krema i know how tempting it is to get close but you're playing with fire what do you hope to change or bring in the v-tubing landscape i mean okay i don't really hope to bring or change anything right out here with the goal to be a transistor to travel with thank god you're so humble that's too much pressure okay i felt a lot to be honest i just want to make my audience smile laugh and and me you didn't even substitute the word like put ink oh my god hey me i had no wait i'm like i'm like 90% sure i read over their stuff i must have approved this what the fuck i read because i remember i changed one sentence of mercies because she was a bit harsh on herself um i must have approved this oh my god i mean shout out to acapella media for like straight up put what the girls said i have to admit they could have like silently edited this stuff but they didn't so shout out again to acapella media for this opportunity um what's one thing you want people to remember you about you and me individually or as a generation uh like indulges or a generation as a generation oh as a generation these girls are all so nice and they deserve the best treat them kindly please they're more than just silly me oh thank you and me what what kind words truly what do you want to represent in the vtuber sphere in megers my little embers i want to represent myself i want the boys to have fun and be cute and i also want to represent honesty even if it makes people want to drop with me for the things i'm honest about yes i agree with that i agree i agree i agree um i'm like i'm like properly reading it for the first time like yeah yeah i put base answers yeah uh is there event in vtuber history that was pretty uh particularly significant for you embers there is but i won't say what it was but it made me realize that i'm worth what i'm worth and that i can get where i want myself i'm still working on getting to where i want but at least i know i can do huh i don't know what that's about not gonna lie i'm new to vtuber stuff well you have picked the fucking worst agency to get started on we are the most like non-traditional vtuber agency but i'm glad you can enjoy the veal or talons we basically do nothing the way you're supposed to do it but thank you again for checking us out you mean a bit welcome to the best agency well in terms of a traditional agency we do everything wrong you know like paying them their worth uh it's terrible anyway thank you so much emmy for that interview i'm not really sure what happened to your voice think you're partying too hard with your family or something like that i don't know yeah that's why it sounds like this okay that's good mercy moddy's up you come mercy moddy's let's listen to your voice and see if i can mimic it and the answer is gonna be no because i know for a fact i can't mimic

vacation our connection is breaking up clearly that that's why yes no no yachts for the owners oh no oh truly a tear is in my eye thinking about uh me bragging about the return on investment yesterday oh yeah that's right sorry we estimate return on investment after six months um talk about over estimation anyway veal uh dear mercy veal lure is the first agency of its kind why did you choose instead of remaining independent now let's just try one more time up an atom bomb i heard you wanted to get to know me better while the allure may be uh agency first of its kind in the end i auditioned due to detail's dream resonating with me there are many factors at play as well i was reaching my dreams with my friends those who made it into other corporations so that i could stamp aside them i'm happy to be here oh mercy i'm glad you accepted you could have said no to me you could have said no in the interview and you still said yes thank you mercy how important was the amount of freedom with with content creation being open to discussing private lives and stuff so i brought my special love diary for me i don't want it i'm so sorry mercy for me i don't want to talk why have you for a say go away mercy and you come for me i don't want to talk why am i going to a say by default what the heck with all the information about me that you need to know so we can be together

american specialized i can't do it i can't do it right hold on hold on all right what voice are we gonna give mercy instead right let's give her the mickey mouse voice let's go for me i don't want to talk about my pl in particular but being given the choice is great my peers do not have to hide who they were and their old fans don't have to go to on hunt i'm a bit of a traditionalist so i still want to keep it on the down low with veal or the freedom with content creation is more lenient and i get to play the games i want and everything is more streamlined for more crucial things don't get it twisted though i still get told no sometimes and that's a little good for me because sometimes my ideas are bad or would be a brand risk oh wait no a bad risk that's why management is there oh thank you mercy for answering that yes i can't believe it you actually got told no when did he tell you no the fuck did we tell you no for i don't even know what platform did you want to make content on prior to this mercy oh oh twitch youtube and fensley that's all i had in mind prior to veal or fensley oh man uh once fired you to create that kind of content or that content in general mercy i used to be an actor i actress whoops i've been unlucky for a lack of better words for a while now i'm probably the most inexperienced of the group as this is my first time really creating that kind of content to me it's a return to form while still exploring my more sensual side haha it's been great fun also a roguet i play a roguet yeah oh wow mercy what the heck is going on in your voice this is making me very gentle um while we're at it mercy do you have any advice for a content careers safely navigating the 18 plus field remember internet safety you learned in high school and i mean it that's really important i cannot stress enough about how important it is to do your new diligence to keep yourself safe also if you do want to do some if you don't want to do something say no yes that is very true please bring up any issues with any things you might not want to do in an audio with us and make you finding his central side children what do you hope to bring or change in the vtube and landscape mercy i hope feel or shows that we are just like any other vtuber agency just with spicier content on the side that content is by choice and if you want to interact with it i hope the taboo of being a not safe or vtuber goes away because in the end like all other vtubers we just want to make you smile and entertain you whoa steady on mercy steady on again you're really getting into the character there um so can you read mario maros in mickey moise's voice as well you want that that's terrible is there anything is there any alt content you're particularly interested in making in mercy mouse mercy mouse i'm still discovering what i like and don't like so i'm exploring all facets of the alternative content i'd like to try experimenting with the medium a little more but we're all we're still in the beginning stages so taking it slow is okay okay but what do you want to represent in the vtuber sphere mercy let us know let us know your thoughts this is a thought-provoking question i suppose that i want to be at least someone who is seen as safe to work with even though i make that kind of content as well i it doesn't define me and means i'm some what it doesn't define me and means i'm some sort of rabid animal that cannot control my urges hot i've losing it i'm actually going schizophrenic right now it was one thing that you want people to remember about you mercy individually or as a generation my laughter and my personality but for indulge i'm just i'm still a newcomer that's learning just i'll do you know shebe's getting jesse from pokemon deal deal shebe's getting x already know i can't do shebe's voice for shit shebe's getting jesse from pokemon ask you little twerp um is there a significant event in vtuber history uh to you as a whole i suppose that the debut of hololive english really brought out about the forefront of vtuber into an international audience as a whole it's no longer a medium that is pretty niche it's becoming more and more acceptable i agree with that there was very interesting discourse discord discourse around a year ago that was like vtuber's dying i don't know if people still say that but i don't think people under oh my hands just farted if you because they're sweaty um there was a bit of internet discord sorry mercy thank you so much for your interview i really do appreciate it haha you're welcome thank you thank you um yeah there's a lot of internet discourse doing that vtuber's dying v tripping is dying and it's like no you don't understand this medium is perfect for a hell of a lot of people a lot of people don't want to like pop their face out or be like basically abused for their looks when obviously you then he's spawning knowing what you've done for your looks um agreed every day we stray further what there's hundreds of beaches it's just more fragmented yeah strongy sway imagine the smell thank you mousy modis oh thank you for having me i really appreciate that okay who's up next on the chopping block she be condom her tail isn't present and you can tell that this is her older design because she actually has lace on the top of her thigh house um her lines her ropes are lines

thank you thank you that's perfect okay she be cotton bomb up you comey come come i'm gonna give sorry i'm gonna give you a shot but let's be honest it's not happening because her voices aren't hello hi there hello sweetheart hello my name is she be cotton bomb i'm my name is she be cotton bomb you're mistress i'm the mistress i guess it's right jesse from pokemon let's go as you twerk the bum dominatrix of via lures the first agency of oh i've just noticed the misprint oops um that's my bad my bad chief um via lures the first oh wait that's the question asked me asking it to her via lures the first agency of this kind she be why did you choose it instead of being an independent as you twerk it's nice having the freedom of being an independent reach over but i longed for a group of people that i could see as sisters and have a a consistent collab partners with similar likes i'd also follow the roadmap of via lures for over a year and shared a lot of the same aspirations as the creative mind behind it all strut stop you're making me blush the fuck the fuck you're making me blush what the heck i also wanted to grow as a creator and learn more about the industry and i couldn't do that without a little bit of help now i have the resources amazing gen mates new knowledge and still manage to have talent freedom i'll stop it you're blowing art you're blowing air up my arse like that i'm gonna get an eagle stroke could these girls have stroke the agency anymore i didn't even direct them they did this themselves okay how in she be was reading the question to herself because uh because good dogs don't speak hey whoa i'm a dog what's going on here are you starting to insinuate so your sponsor ash that's that's how that's how i do a prompt get into the voice okay how important was the amount of freedom on content creation being open to pl etc for you i was ash who twerk i was extremely attracted to the fact that feel lower broke a lot of standard reach over roles but pl discussion wasn't a deal breaker for me also if i went in to sign the contract and felt like my rights as a creator were being taken away um in any fashion i would never have signed on yeah they all say that it's the most pathetic contract i've ever seen uh no matter the agency i do have to say ash out of professionalism i still double checked with my management to ask permissions because it's always good to make sure i mean that's pretty much melted away at this point that was probably right at the start when the girls were unsure how much they're allowed to do but i had to keep reminding the girls like hey you don't need permission go go don't need permission go there can i tweet this go send it as long as it's on the right twitter account send it you don't need permission but this was written a bit earlier so some of the stuff is about me how can you not stroke the agency when instead of working for the agency the agency works for them honestly sorry my glakes have got a fucking me mark on them right ash from pallet time come on no no no ash uh jesse from pokemon come on i can do this i can do this okay and then no more accents okay um ash would work it's really refreshing however to still feel like an indie you'd have a team that has my back and supports me with whatever creative endeavor i've put my silly mind to oh she be stop it my little sheepster's room oh sorry i'm covering up chat sorry sorry sorry chat sorry i'm dumb oh hold on a bit uh what platforms did you want to make content prior to join in v alert so when you were just doing your thing i was always the casual twitch streamer oh not twitch andy and i hoped someday i could go full time adjusting to youtube has been interesting but i don't mind it it's probably funny for me to say but i was never going to do anything my pl like i'm doing now what's that corruption arc yeah you're welcome ash i wasn't going to make a patreon or even consider fansly i see this reincarnation and my previous version of myself as almost two sides of the same coin i can be your angel or your devil it's very cool to learn how other platforms function and how you can develop and expand your audience alongside your main platform oh wait did she see the angle oh my god is that why it was spelled weird i can be your angle or your devil bro i thought i was like why the f*** did she spell it like that but everything else was spelled correctly my dumb ass didn't read it right uh so she stares what inspired just make that kind of content or that content in general just content in general okay it is the meme it's definitely the i can be your angel or your devil uh i've always wanted to be a content creator since watching youtubers like jenna marbles markiplier i'm not even saying that i wanted to have the same positive effect on viewers that watching my favorite content creator had on me and still do as for the erotic content i've always been indifferent about it i have dabbled extremely briefly in the past in the raw and erotic content what it really got nowhere so i never continued with it ash and now i have to learn and improve from the best of the best i'm not uh is there any other content you're particularly interested in making i'm not saying that name though i'm not saying the name of the content creator because i just know with my accent it's gonna be 10 times worse if someone just cropped the first like me saying the first part of that person's name it's over it's over for me in german is it over for mesh yeah yeah it's over for mesh okay it's over um uh is there any how did i do that to the batman theme okay anyway is there any content you're particularly interested in making it i really want an opportunity to voice and uh loot animation are you joking me someone contacted the website about that and i didn't reply i don't know if it's too late to reply hold on hold on i need to write a note in the discord hold on i didn't realize she wanted to do that and someone contacted the website and i was like oh the girls don't have enough time for that well i didn't reply but uh i need to write a note like right now and hopefully we can grab that freaking thing um um uh um um uh what do i do she be uh fucking animation voice over offer email somewhere find it asap uh in case time expired because she actually wanted to pursue that whoopsies sorry she be i might have a job for you very shortly sorry sheeps sorry sheepsters that was my bad my bad but we got we got we got it now we got it now we got that we okay right hold on wait back back back back um yeah a little ash from pal ash twerp when i get a 3d model i would like to take up poll lessons and share my progress with viewers damn sheepsters going all out do you have any advice for people who want to create 18 plus content yes advice advice any advisors any advisors did you literally write that yep i have a note on my discord and i just spam there and whatever um the most ash twerp the most important thing is please do not let the hate or negativity get to you it's not worth the stress you little twerp there is something out there that will not gel with there what there is someone out there that will always not gel with you or your content and that's okay you do not have to cater to everyone do what you're comfortable with and do not feel pressured if you need to limit interaction with people who get pushy don't be afraid to hit that mute or block button damn sheepsters she for the thorough how do you always start with ash twerp so in the va say the things in order to get into a character's voice you can give yourself a prompt that is my prompt to do jesse from pokemon i can't do it naturally and what do you hope to bring or change in v tubing landscape i hope that companies consider the transparency of our splits and make adjustments accordingly in favor of the talents if they have the profit v tubing is an ever-growing industry and towns deserve a bit more for the work that they oh my god preachy be are we taking down the high table together and i i'll take them the high table with you any day okay what's one thing you want people to remember about you sheepsters individually or as a generation of dealer as a company we're breaking the status quo of what it means to be a corporate vtuber you can allow and manage alternative content you can talk about your pl if you want and you can have a human relationship with your talents instead of treating them like far oh oh tell her is she be like fodder and still be a successful company as a generation a group of girls that just want to have a group of girls that just want to have fun make you happy and we appeal to all if not many in some way shape or form and then you can hire unknown oh that's so cute and and sorry and that you can hire unknown talent there's a few gems out there oh my god i'm gonna agree a few of us were complete nobodies but someone saw our potential no it gave us a chance what the fuck i'm saying no that's so sweet i'm thankful for that as myself your favorite girl failure scuff dorky scuff dorky dog always root for the underdog i'm not kidding always root for the underdog hold on let me let me recalibrate my model i'm looking a bit funny i'm looking a bit skew if okay there we go recalibrate oh oh blow and smoke up your butt is supposed to be our job literally let me repeat that last bit uh you can hire unknown talent there's a few gems no there's lots of gems out there it just ain't easy the problem it's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy unhidden gem thinks they're not good enough to apply to vtuber agency don't apply don't get shown off type thing it really can be as simple as that there's like a lot of like i remember we got emailed on the website after closing applications and someone was like i'm so sorry i've missed the window because i didn't feel like worthy enough to apply and it was like bro you missed your deadline if we can't we can't make exceptions but it's like don't hold yourself back seriously the talent pool is massive it is like it's beyond comprehension how many little hidden gems are out there and they just need a running start they just need like that exposure they need someone you know with the money that can be like okay here's shorts right upload them right here's a bit of advertisement money in this here's in that yeah it's a self-propagating issue where the lack of confidence is your work yeah the imposter syndrome yeah and fear of rejection as well as absolutely humongous barrier for some people it really is um you know i'm not gonna sit here and be like oh i don't experience that so i'm not gonna you know be say xyz about it um it is this is a big thing anyway uh sorry she be to ramble over it's fine um thank you uh what do you want to represent in the vtuber and spear sheepsters um i think i've represented in my content enough already oh man oh we love a confident dump but that you can still make 18 plus content and still be a normal streamer on common part horrors some have the idea that lute tubers are coomed brain 24 7 and flick their beads on stream and do nothing else haha wait wait would that be like a milk laugh i got uh haha no that's not what the fuck is a milk laugh hold on hold on i'm gonna literally tape in milk laugh on youtube and see if anything comes up uh nope nothing came up well i tried um and what is a milk laugh oh i don't know something like that uh i still act like my dorky self play games and create other content like everyone else i'm just an added what it's just an added bonus i moan in your ear on patreon wink wink please support the girls on patreon we're undercutting the fucking mark yet please i'm begging i'm on my knees but i'm begging begging you okay as they're an event in v tripping history that is significant to you my dear sheepsters yes or no the creation of project melody a melody was the catalyst in my opinion of the boom of lute tubers she pushed the boundaries of 18 plus content but still displayed herself as a cute and talented streamer a normal human being but also a friendly vtuber with a unique approach to 3d i can safely say she is a pioneer in not only on say so content creation but audience interaction and streaming and in general thanks thank you melody fantastic thank you so much sheebie for your fantastic okay um right i'm gonna thank you i'm gonna let you go rest because you don't have a stream today question mark i really need to download everyone's things all at once so i can start pulling up and be like right who this is who's coming on the day thank you so much sheepsters up next who we got right i'm interviewing myself let's go right let's go let's go let's get hype hype man look at that look at that design so my design was actually finalized at this stage um kind of as you can see i've got pearlescent if you didn't know i shimmer i don't actually have white on my outfit i'm pearlescent check out wait hold on check out this oh hold on that's my stream deck oh hold on that's the wrong one see i'm all wiggly and pearly essencey okay that's what i look like but i'm scrawny cut oh it's a hypnotic cut of fish that has been streaming for a month and has yet to put out one piece of hypno content other than a live stream uh and i did it for like 40 minutes and never did it any longer so obviously the first question did not apply to me vealour is the first agency why did you choose it nope man man's was pre-selected so that question does not apply to me so i had to get creative and give myself an alternative question and i've already lost the damn magazine hold on i have found the magazine okay how did you attract independent v-tubers to vealour is the only question substituted for me okay so first getting our name out there was a challenge but we got incredibly lucky on youtube and the algorithm tapped into the reveal trailer the announcement of vealours all the way back at new years is just shy of 100 000 views on youtube okay and i'm going to discuss that in a short because there's a reason why i got picked up in the algorithm then the vealour website stated what we wanted i cooked on that website okay i set it straight up i said this is the cut this is the expectations there was no oh i don't know what i'm signing up for oh i don't know i don't know no we set it off the bat so the people that did apply knew what they were getting into okay so there really wasn't a struggle like as i said the talent pool was pretty big considering new vtuber agency founding members uh quite a few different rules most vtuber agencies are like eh you didn't have to make content prior to applying yeah they shove your shit in the bin if you don't have any evidence so okay and yet there's people still asking questions honestly that's not i'm wearing marathon runners why yes of course you don't sound like strawny how dare you what you want to make my accent harsher okay so how important was the amount of freedom content discussing pls etc although i confess it's not traditional and may lead to a few people not enjoying what vealour have to offer he'll offer probably i'm no here to pretend that gen one indulges made up of people who have never streamed before is this what you want yeah actually all of the girls had more streaming experience than me this is true so it was quite funny going through applications in that sense it was rather humorous it was humorous okay uh thank you strawny for the next question what platform did you want to make content prior to vealour right youtube has always been a staple for many eyes and i have found overall that their rules are mostly fair bad the bloody uh this this age terribly this age terribly we all have warnings for breathing in an ear anyway twitch however seems to have issues with using rules to punish some but not others it is more of a pick the lesser of two evil situation twitter or x is much more for an overall promotion and connecting with other vtubers for collaborations i'm afraid personally i'm just no suited for twitter outside of that and i'm just i'm shy on twitter what inspired you to create alternative content or content in general i never personally okay had any issues where it's just another media source you either wish to consume it and seek it out or you just deny at all i suppose in my case due to how comfortable i am where i find it quite fascinating to learn about what people enjoy and challenge myself to give them what they want and that's true i like i like when you guys tell me something outrageous and i'm like bet all right let's do it let's do it let's do it we need a scotland forever okay i'll make scrawny say scotland forever at the end of the interview okay um is there any content you're particularly interested in making it in the all alternative version i have always had a secret fascination about hypnosis but i am well aware of the safety concerns that come first it is with this new breath of life that the allure has offered me that i can finally go down this rabbit hole and see what happens this is actually true um i've always enjoyed hypnosis but being absolutely terrified to make it do you have any advice for people who might want to come into safely creating a content of an alternate variety delete everything related to your legal name and social media under it that is rule one okay chase louise from there be on the side of caution now sadly you are an adult and you are responsible for your actions no matter how foolish they may have been in the moment please do not think however you will be the only numpty on planet earth to make a mistake that is only natural so do not be harsh on yourself you will say and do stupid things that is life okay relax no that's serious all right okay thank you started streaming 69 minutes ago i am oh yeah what do you hope to bring to or change in the vtubing landscape on the surface on the surface the answer would be that the western vtuber agencies are those agencies that wish to appeal to these western agencies also understand that comes with culture changes for example more freedoms of course the scottish person says more freedoms you can take my life but i can't take my freedom honestly most freedoms less restrictions as a whole on vtuber agencies stop being greedy gifts and pay your talents what they earned you did not earn that wake up you didn't earn it you weren't the one streaming you weren't the one putting the hours in pay your talents higher than 50 percent that's all i'm fucking asking stop doing less than 50 percent it's disgusting thank you anyway that's me um anyway now that i've passed that along uh oh you got a bit passionate there strony i do apologize okay okay let's go next um what's one thing that you want people to remember about you individually or a generation individually it is uh is to be yourself unironically and unapologetically as a generation well who better to indulge in than us oh thank you get it because our uh our gen name is indulge oh oh sorry was i not to explain it oh i'm sorry okay sorry sorry uh i'll see myself out oh well oh well i'll try my best uh what do you want to represent in the vtuber sphere stronzo uh that you do not have to know everything to be accepted into the vtuber community okay i could have easily uh what's going on here pan up fishing what you said i have absolutely terrible news i do not speak whatever language that is uh let's open up google docs thank you for the 20 pan optician uh let's sorry google translate i'll take the google translate hold on hold on come on google translate come on you can do it you can do it it's a russian national anthem no all right okay russia our great power russia our beloved country the mighty world a great glory your property for all time your property for all time no it's it's not communism communism doesn't work because of greedy our souls but we can get close to it natibia oh and of course sister fucking pops up as soon as russians mentioned okay dude and okay that's it that's it that's it you're done we got freedom okay do you see that cute cuttlefish do you see the cute cuttle fishery flings that's my kami off you cola oh narrow thank you for the tip and the compliment and pan option thank you for the ridiculous tip okay this then comes in as soon as the russians are mentioned we got freedoms around here partner uh what do you want to represent oh i was halfway saying to that sorry okay uh that you didn't have to know everything to be accepted by the vtubing community i could have easily have been chewed up and spat back out but instead was welcomed with open arms for my curiosity and wanting to learn more it has led to various uh humorous moments such as tisker which is short for tisker it now is being called tisker in my community because i didn't know what it meant and again i didn't know what that so meant and you guys were just so nice and taught me everything um and i think it's because like you know you can uh yeah did you take yeah and fucking okay you're done i still say tisker though literally tisker mentioned any tisker yeah um we say instead of tisker or tskr tisker um is there any significant event in vtubing that is incredibly important to you um the uprising of creator-owned vtuber agencies is upon us now okay um socks agencies a fantastic example yumi plus i think is technically an example um having someone at the helm that has had experience of what and knows what it's like um to produce content and uh knows what to expect is very exciting i can't wait to see more agencies come out that are like that and you never know viola might just collaborate with them i sure it is i hope you're okay yes we are uh it should wink wink but yes um i think creator-owned vtuber agencies are fantastic because they're realistic and like they know what's up they're like i've made content before i know what like kind of strange you're under um kind of like is a split hollow live collab no what i don't have you think i have contacts for hollow live the fuck the fuck as if we as if they'd even let us collab they'd be like oh those are darties no having it anyway thank you so much uh strong zoo for your uh interview skull and forever okay well that was very weak um yeah i'm still feeling a bit tired i'm gonna be honest i'm not sure i can just go skull and forever yeah i'm not really got it and before hollow live mentions you guys there is zero chance of a hollow live even noticing as far as i'm aware unless one of the girls just like fucking exponentially blows up ma ma ma um although that would be outrageous because of her lore wow we did it we read through oh wait hold on actually let me put this back up but i'm gonna make it smaller i wish it was a little bit smaller i wish it was a baller i wish i had a rabbit in a hat with a bat in a baseball bat or something like that do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do right and then i'm gonna put myself over here oh my god i actually did it i didn't ramble for like seven hours we actually got through the magazine check us out i have been indulged indulges all over you never has a high change i shall contact the gods to rearrange it honestly um yes we're on a magazine uh and it wasn't the magazine that you have to pull out and open and then like an extra page drops there no it's like an actual magazine yay get it it's not one of those

all-knowing being um but yeah uh i am going to take a drink of water i i urge everyone to have a hydration a little hydration um i love it i love it water's so good the way it hydrates my throat and stops me from having a coffin fit delicious 10 out 10 every question what is the meaning of life page very base scottish person indeed but you talk like an old wise god do i super chat yourself to give yourself money so we uh veal or mod what's going on here what have you done what have you done veal or mod we saw that she isn't all-knowing that's a months loving honestly do you prefer your water cold or room temperature a wee bit too late a wee bit too late right hold on let me refresh the marshmallows um i am going to be reading them off my monitor i'm not gonna have them displayed what was the removed mercy line if you're at liberty to say um she said something about self-deprecating and it was a bit it was a bit on the severe side so i rephrased the sentence to be nicer to herself um she used a phrase that wasn't very friendly but uh i'm not gonna say the exact phrase because that's not very nice but uh yeah i think she'll i'm i'm sure she'll be fine with it um wait what top bottom switch views are bosoms bosoms female female male male male female what the heck you've just blasted right into it uh wait is that what i am i just blasted into it uh it was maybe we'll come you know we'll come back to come back to it okay uh moment i love you replaying i love you did you like me doing all the impressions it's a very deep question what are oh hold on right hold on hold on what are some ways companies can companies set up right whoever sent this question one using spell check and two i can't read properly what are some ways companies can set up stuff so the company itself can protect their talents fun set aside for legal concerns taxes content eight screenshots platform liaisons anti anti stuff teaching the ropes um i think just being realistic like if you have been a content creator and then you're behind the scenes you know what the girls are up against like um obviously we shut down the marshmallows for quite a bit because like a few of the talents were having issues and like i guess that was like a measure to basically we took on we got the girls feedback and we were like nah forget this you're done so um and we were like right everyone off marshmallow right now don't reply don't do nothing we're fucked up we made a mistake sure do love when the xbox servers are done have the servers down okay if another idiot comes up with mirrors i'm gonna play doom in real nah ah barely audible oh did i do a tiny little burp there i wasn't paying attention um taxes again don't actually spend the money until you paid the tax you should always hold 30 percent back uh i guess if you want tax uh content aid so uh that's like collaborations with people outside of the agency um that's like putting advertisement money in shorts for example so we do something that i don't think any other agency really offers we pay for the shorts to be made for the talents we make the thumbnails for them their schedules all that we try and give them at least stuff possible they're obviously the only overwhelming problem is like i took a while to find the editors and get settled with the editors like um a few of them couldn't do it a few of them uh now currently have ongoing in real life obligations which caused a massive backlog like that's why irisa is my personal clipper because um i was just having so many issues and at the rate the shorts were being made it was like at one point one person was making all the shorts and it was like no that's just not viable at all um but azura is next to get shorts and then shebe's getting a batch and then i think by that point we will have four people who can make clips on at the same time but a lot of in real life stuff happened in their lives which caused a massive backlog and it's caused an issue because i would have wanted a lot more shorts out by now i don't know for me it's a respect thing there are people at least try to treat them as proper human beings and not circus freaks uh communication is key um what are you saying stroney my muse my flame my 16th chapel my 5th sympathy symphony oh god you're making me say big words my cute and adorable seaweed first happy one month

there's a wee mistake in the background okay relax if you can hear a bump because they bumped their desk while they're recording relax okay relax goodness great some of you some of yous are running a muck i can tell you that mad or red thank you for becoming a member i appreciate it there is a membership stream after the stream 20m to shake your spear it's time i write a four page review on a literal analysis oh god honestly um the shadows harassing moment honestly i haven't bought the shadow can their girls use their live team or models for video content on patreon nope it is strictly audio nothing else is getting posted on it for the safety and the security of the girls' income sources i do apologize if that's this appointing news um easter egg in emi's interview is there shut up hold on stop wait a minute is there actually where is it there's an easter egg in emi's interview hold on a minute how do you spot the interview and i don't spot it where's hold on hold on easter egg in emi's interview she used the phrase keep yourself safe kiss your sister where keep yourself safe on the internet safety part don't compare some friends of people consume quite a certain keep yourself safe please i don't i don't actually think that's an easter egg i think that's actually just uh what she meant like genuinely keep yourself safe i don't actually think that's an easter egg because she said please if it was an easter egg it would be keep yourself safe no i think she may or may not have actually actually i don't think that's an easter egg this month was fantastic thank you for everything you did and that you're doing seeing how excited and happy you are makes me feel so good and honestly inspires me oh yeah can you say how can you keep up with everything i think i would die in two seconds um so i basically don't experience what people explain burnout to be and the reason i don't experience it is thanks to autism i don't know how i got lucky with that kind of autism but i did um i basically now don't get me wrong i can get frustrated and fatigued but when i go to bed and then when i wake up it's like a fresh new day like let's go again and one of the best things that i am able to do is i say to myself as long as i do one thing a day so after i finish stream i say to myself i'll do one thing a day if that's editing an audio collab if that's you know writing a script collab or something like that um as long as i do that then you know we're on the up and up that's all i need to do um just one thing a day um maybe i can impart that wisdom to you with that phrase and just say one thing a day doesn't matter how big or small it is like if you are a bed rotting max or that one thing a day can literally be brushing your teeth and then roll back in a bed one thing a day that's it all you got to do one thing a day um that's uh the reason why i can do it to end others might not be able to uh can we send save for work bibbutes on marshmallow yeah how does catbox work also um it's like a website you put your link in it and then you send me the link here what's the news on a new set of emotes uh any og sands is there any og sands that noticed ic

philosophy for a long time then you have fantastic philosophy unironically it is a bed rotting max or yeah like you can get pheromone max or see that's myself not beating the high wisdom allegations

just starting i want to know where would you like to time travel the past or the future unfortunately i'm a woman so the past probably isn't that good but the future seems pretty gloom so i'll stick right here in this timeline uh uh you know born too late to see something born too early to see the future born in the same timeline the strony calls a hungry jacks or mackers uh i get the absolute a screaming shite so if i get mackers for some reason so hungry jacks it is for some reason mcdonald's uh breakfast i can eat but if i eat anything else off the menu it makes me have a lava flow yeah rip this is the best time future means i get to see all strone's vids but i won't be able to join the streams oh that's like really sad though gregs is oh gregs is bad don't say such things reflings next time you go to gregs you order cheese and hamburger well you don't order it you pick up from the west side bit um and then you get uh sausage and cheese and bean pastry and you get the apple juice that's what i used to get from gregs i don't like any other their bakery stuff like the sweet stuff it's always rubbish we die on this hill no i don't i don't like the grill i like the sausage and beans i really like beans though beans what is the wildest fantasy you've ever had um so there's this concept called the asmr booth and it's it's growing arms legs it has hair it's probably got brain cells at this point um basically i get to tingle you in person and put a mask on you and like uh the joke is like you buy the premium pass at like a convention and then like i put you in the soundproof booth with me and then things get out of hand really quickly okay um i've already wrote a plot about that and i've already recorded it at the stage and hi cuddles i love you hi riefling i love you thank you for the love here's your all-time celebrity crash bayonetta this bayonetta account is a crash what would i do if i only had 24 hours to live is this a threat riefling what's going

instructed to use it for his early retirement so he doesn't work himself into an early grave uh what other stuff gimley and vego gimley and vego sadly i don't want to stress them out and send them to scotland thank you zarian for the tip brian why did you say it like that booth are you squiddin me right now asmr booth premium pause booth asmr be okay i like that sorry dang i would be i would say

hmm right well let's uh let's not die uh let's not die uh rather they don't go to a shelter because the poor things were in a shelter for long enough uh what is the most embarrassing moment in all your childhood a projectile vomited in public but it actually humbled me to the point where like i don't feel embarrassed going in public like about anything if you have ever been so humbled to projectile vomit right with no privacy then uh yeah it turns out you don't really get scared of going outside have i ever been arrested oh just because i'm scotish i and i didn't sound posh you think i've been arrested and in trouble with the polis well i don't know i've never been arrested uh but the polis are right arseholes honestly um hello what's going on we're doing what's called a q&a on marshmallow and you can ask anonymous questions hitting the bed hitting a bit what hitting a bed yen is something like that would be a yes no i've been arrested are you joking uh can you give chat a smooch a smooch pack her up did you like that have the talents discussed uh in uh alternative collab audios yes uh next month is when the first alternative collabs come out um it is a tip please understand that some of the girls have only just started doing solo audios so to already jump into a collab audio is quite a high stretch so please don't be weird and like this is so disappointing you think that's gonna be the only one they'll ever make please i'm gonna i'm gonna throw up an anger shadow box and over here okay rip i'm on speakers i'm so sorry please lower your volume of me that was uncalled for i think my heart beat went up all of a sudden why is it that round pizzas come in square boxes for transport mains um if you have a square box sitting on a car seat for example um it is more likely to stay put and stay steady so transport much easier yes yes but if it was a circle imagine that thing rolling around in the back seat get in that thing would be trashed by the time it got delivered um or you took it back home if you go and pick up your what the fuck is that noise oh it's my chair sorry my chair sorry i'm fucking out of my heart attack there we need good boys we need good um sorry this one's i need to read it first before i say it i'll go that's so specific i don't think i can answer that because it's related to the girls tea did you guys ever decide whether you're gonna use bansley or not uh the girls can stream on it this month uh if they want to smile um i'm not stopping them i need to give them their login details uh but i have never i don't have any i don't know i'll let them figure it out and then i'll call for what they do because i actually have never used the streaming service uh vealer has made me think about getting into v-tube and what advice would you give someone delete all that shit delete every lick of your legal name online delete every lick of a photo that you are not putting out delete delete everything uh don't tell your parents that you're earning money um or your family that you're earning money uh just in case they turn on you i've had so many horror stories of um girls telling me they told their family they earned money and now they're in a horror situation where like they're the breadwinner the family type thing a it's different if you want to offer the money but get in delete yourself you literally made a short um did i make a short what do you think your last words will be um um to be honest i'm probably gonna be dementia shitting myself in a care home uh so i'm not really gonna i'm probably a mumbling mess i'll probably be like ah back to scotland i go well wait no i'll die in scotland so i'll already be on it uh it'd probably be like oh that was fun if i if i was coherent it would be that was fun like do you know how ridiculous it is and how people would kill to be in my position to like mess around and have fun um and like literally i got to play my childhood game yesterday and i got enraged by a piece of fruit uh like and i got gamerscore and stuff um mumble something about the high table did i did i do it did i destroy it and then the we care home workers like yeah yeah sure

that wait she has not that good of a memory we love you nonetheless the last group hey strunzo quick question uh which way of the neton gets the least cut of um that would be stream element yes i

baltro i'm sorry it's such a good it's such a good game it really is um uh do you have any productivity or time management tips beside one thing a day um i am a write it down kind of gal i write everything down that i need to do and like so i can cross off and remind myself what i need to do that might work for you if you need visual stimuli to tell you what to do next but basically you need to actually this is one of the really big tips if you want to work hard and get a lot of stuff done okay um do you is you need to feel your body this sounds ridiculous but it's true if you're using your brain and you're thinking and your strategic doing strategies and all that you genuinely need to feel your brain in order to do all these things it is not possible without eating so don't starve yourself don't forget to eat it is so important for electrical brain activity to do it bang okay um hey stroney love your scotch accent what accent in the world sounds the most attractive to me to me oh that's a hard question i don't know if i want to be like stereotypical and haha to to baguettes but it's pretty stereotypical um i can't even say that um that was the accent in bad the german accent german guys sound so aggressive but their words are so gentle like you know i don't think i could pick that um excuse me after 21 days i've created a new nightly habit what a collage of

endurance streams planned when my dad goes home ps i made a bibu pick but i think i'll make a better one for you to enjoy while sending tiggy also sorry for being forward uh um i don't i don't know how to even censor that word uh unique merchandise uh that violor might get uh in the future um once all the girls hit 10 000 subscribers i'm going to contact a company and see if they will entertain it the problem with trying to get uh a collaboration is they need we need to provide evidence of sales for them to even bother with what we're gonna ask for so i'm gonna wait until we're all 10 000 subscribers i don't know if we're gonna get a shared one that might be the only way where all our faces are on the same package um but if we do get it the girls will be releasing a free public audio that would complement this unique merchandise we may or may not get uh but you will be eating good either way okay a shared one for sharing well no really but yeah they need to see a potential return yes so i think it's a bit too premature for lack of better words to contact the company um but yes if uh don't be shy to subscribe to the other girls as well not just me uh because everyone this is a a rising tide no a high tide rises all ships or whatever the heck the saying is always forget it ideas for gender three a girl who is totally not your government agent trying to get you to pay taxes
