00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Good morning sleepyhead!

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Good morning good evening good afternoon!

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Good morning sleepyhead!

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Good morning sleepyhead!

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
Good morning sleepyhead!

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Good morning good evening good afternoon!

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
Are you ready to play puzzle game with me?

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
You can already see the first one.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Okay, so in order to link to it,

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I'm going to have to constantly close the game,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
well close it from stream, so actually close.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
Okay, but I will link you this website.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
It should have a little insert, so you can name yourself if you like.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
You can do something humorous.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
But we're just doing a test.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
This is testing 250 pieces an image.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
We'll just take a moment...

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Yeah, that's not even names!

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
You're just spamming!

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
That was so quick!

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
So we're just testing if you guys are able to

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
figure out the 250 pieces.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I've got some cam music on in the background.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
It's just a chill day today.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
I've got a few funny images, but this is just the start,

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
so I just wanted to see how you guys do.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm going to put Azura together,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
because Azura's got teal in her hair.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
I can see AC's got blue over here,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
so I'm just going to drag her over here.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Hello! Good morning good evening good afternoon!

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I'm having to play Super Dipper safe.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
My dad has fully come down with a cold.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Not me in the middle with my little scored eyes!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Um...

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Mumme!

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Um...

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
My...

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, my dad's unfortunately come down with a flu.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
I actually had to go to the pharmacy yesterday for him.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And like I explained what's wrong,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
and they were like if he's not...

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
If he still...

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
He felt dizzy,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
but he took some strong sleeping medication

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
that he got from the pharmacy,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
and they warned him like they don't use too much of it.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
But I don't know, he like phoned me after stream,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
like I was only in the other room,

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
but he was too weak to like come out.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Um...

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And he was like I feel dizzy,

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
so like I ran,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I got ready, went to the pharmacy,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
and the lady behind the counter was like

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
unfortunately we can't do anything for that kind of thing,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
if it's not better in 24 hours,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
like go with the doctor.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
So I'm currently quarantining myself from my dad,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
but the problem is we're sharing a space

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and I really don't want to get sick.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Um...

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
So I had take away,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
and he's had subway.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Just to fill his tongue.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Oh, there's the top of my peril.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
My head, please.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I can see that's my shell,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
but it's not fitting anywhere.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Wait, that's my shell, is it not?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh no, that's my hair piece.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
These are my two shells.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Where did I go?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I had my eyes here so I couldn't go.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh, there's me.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay, my shell goes here somewhere.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
And then this is my other shell over here.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I'm gonna move these out of the room.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm not sure that they are.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm stealing pieces from people's hands.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
I'm sorry.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
Right, this is a zero sleep,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
because I can see that purple from anywhere.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
But it's just a really chill day.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Um, nice and easy.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Um, I am...

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh, you can't see,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
because I'm a big hair, hold on.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Above, because I want to redact it,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
you're redacted, redacted.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Thank you for censoring yourselves, Reeflings.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You guys are very smart when it comes to streaming.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
You guys don't give yourself enough credit

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
for how smart or cool you are.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Um, I can see Mercy's head is being formed up here.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Right, someone has gone for the old top method.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
So if we can drag a zero up here and Mercy up here,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
we might be in somewhere.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Right, I can see that's a part of my shell.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Someone popped that up here.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh wait, I'll move a little bit.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I'm the dumbest Reefing love mummy.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Wait, maybe I should go this side today.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I don't normally go this side.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Or did I just need to be a wee bit smaller today?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, you can talk in game 2 if you want.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
But yeah, I think he's going to get better soon.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
He says he feels better, but he coughed up like phlegm

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
or something.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I can't remember what it's called.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Surprised we didn't have a mate,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
a mate hunt or a mate ox, huh?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
I don't know, you guys play so well in games together.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I think someone said a way of the go,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
they were like, normally like whenever a streamer

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
does something multiplayer that could be easily ruined,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
like the autism gets a bit of a chat,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
but someone said something along the lines of

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
like, oh mummy's just so happy to play

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
and see us that it never comes out.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I feel very loved when we can do goofy things like this together.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Why is my eye out of alignment?

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
Oh you guys forget, it's 250,

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
it's 250 pieces too easy.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
The next unlock is going to be my schedule for next week.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
So you have to figure out what my schedule is.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Let me get really clear.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah, you can see the goods.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
I can't wait for the 10k stream.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Strony's bathtub, yeah, yeah, yeah, but

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I'm done with the re-

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
message deleted by Strony's followers.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Family portrait, oh, oh dear.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Someone accidentally did it.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
This is emi's hair, oh sorry.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
We have a few issues, we have a few technical errors,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
don't worry we're getting there in the end.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
It's so efficient.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
But yeah, the next one you're going to unlock,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I'm going to have to hide the screen,

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
because you're going to unlock my schedule for next week.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
But should I make it 500 pieces?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't know.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
It keeps moving the puzzle your mum's just like.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Okay I'll do 500 for my schedule

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
and then I will talk over what we're playing next week together.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Are doing next week.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Why is this music so emotional for no reason?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
I just typed in copyright free Zelda.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Whoever's moving the puzzle please stop doing that.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
You're making it a bit harder to complete

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
and we've got quite a few images to get through.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
I have behind the scenes images

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
that have never seen the light of day before.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So I'm very excited to show that.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
So I don't know what you guys are going to react to.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Use control to lock it in please gang.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
What?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
What and then release?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Why you did it?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Okay so this was just an easy one to get you started.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
These are the emotes of eyes.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
You guys have put in the worst thing.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm in the way of it.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I just made it nice and easy.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I can't join because I'm on phone.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I'm sorry.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
It's just a casual stream snipe.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
This isn't intense or anything.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
We're literally sitting making puzzles.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Right let's replay.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
What's the replay going to look like?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
Okay so this is me when I load it in.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I'm not jumping away from us.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Oh that was so fast.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Okay I think you guys are going to need like 500 pieces.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Because that was far too easy for you.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I don't want to sit on chat.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Sorry I'm sitting on chat if I'm over here.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Sorry.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Excuse me.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Just coming through.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Okay you want a thousand pieces?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Oh I'm not sure about that.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
Hold on.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I think I need to...

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh no.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Do I need to do a new room every time?

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
I think I need to give a new room every time.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Room settings.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh dear.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh dear oh dear.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
I think I need to create a new room darlings.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I'm so sorry.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Next one is my schedule.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
And we can do a thousand pieces?

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Are you sure you want a thousand pieces?

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
I don't think we can because of the background on it.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I'm going to do 750 pieces.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Okay 700 pieces a schedule test.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
I think...

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
Oh it's already just made the thing.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh this looks difficult.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm not sure.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
50 pieces might be too much for us reeflings.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I know.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Look I'm really testing.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Pet pie says 750 pieces puzzle.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Puzzle and it's my schedule.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Rollie legend.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
Thank you for becoming a member for over a month.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
I was able to...

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Did that work?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I swear if it does.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
He's not.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
This one's not the easiest.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I'll just make sure you guys are joining me.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Or did I link the wrong thing?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I think I linked the right thing.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Yeah this one's 750 pieces.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
I'll wait until you guys are in in.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Or is it not working?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't see you guys able to join the list.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
If we all work together it'll be fine.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
I'm in?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
That doesn't display anyone.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It just says me the big fish.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
We're in?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Is mine broken?

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Is it moving?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Is it moving for anyone?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
We're dragging pieces.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Refresh?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Oh.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Huh.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Oh are you in?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
You're here.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Yay!

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Okay good luck figuring out my thing.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I will give you a hint.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
The ginger goes to the left of the schedule because that's what the photo is.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Any skin colour goes to the left because again that's what the photo is.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't know why they didn't like that.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
God my joke wasn't seen.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I'm sorry wait what was your joke?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
We're in let's go.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh wait hold on let me get out of the way of the chat.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I'm always in the way I think I'm gonna have to...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I can't believe it but I'm standing to the side.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Are you guys okay if I cover up chat a little bit?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
We're in let's go.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
End the stream straight up.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
And it...

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Well let's just see.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
My pintas.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
My saw.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
That's actually really good.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Oh I wish that was the tail.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I don't know what the tail is.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Let's go.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
This puzzle is long like a reflexant.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Oh why am I getting smaller?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Don't be shy.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh my god how have you put together an eye already?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
That's insane.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
You guys are too good at this.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Like unironically you guys are too good.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And then you get to figure...

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Oh!

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
Not you guys already figuring out plop plop plop.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Is it in my schedule?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
All I see is plop plop plop yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Oh hold on I've not got live chat on.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
It's horrible.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Quality mate viewers are discussing a game idea

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
where multiple people collaboratively solve

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
a very large jigsaw puzzle.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
That is the most accurate one I've seen so far.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
No?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Look how efficient you guys are.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Really color coding down here.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
What color coordination of the purple?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
The edge pieces?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Someone's going to absolutely ham on the edge pieces.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Of course that's the first discernible thing

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
that comes together.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh!

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And more of the words are coming together.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
What do you think it says?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It says get educated.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Get educated.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Plop plop plop.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Refling's the master of edge truly.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
We live in a society.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I can see my belt coming together.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Am I supposed to be doing this with you guys?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Or am I allowed to like commentate

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
as if this is like a super MLG game?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And the reflings are coming in clutch.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
We have the border of the south.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
We have a border north and left.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Oh, okay.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Hold on a minute.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
We've got a whole quadrant.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
We have the shape over here.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
And of course I'm covering it up.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I'll go in the middle.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
As we can see to my right.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Well, it's my right.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Your left, I guess.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Look at me.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
It's in there.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
And we're getting...

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
It's all coming together.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
There's like no good area to go.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Isn't that amazing?

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I hate navigating.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
I'll just be all the way down here.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Thank you for all your hard work.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Refling.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Hi.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Hi, Johnny.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
Hi, Refling.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Good morning.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
We're playing a ridiculous game

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
where we put puzzles together.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
But the reward for doing the puzzle,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
you'll never guess what it is.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
As you get to see what my schedule is.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
For this week.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, I see it.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I see one.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Epic Gamer, thank you for coming

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
to member and to support.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Oh, no.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
My freaking stream elements isn't up.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
So I can't see the history.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh, and I'm just really big.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It's one of those streams where things

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
aren't working the way they ought to be.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Thank you, Gamberly Legends.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I made the month membership today.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Congratulations.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Thank you.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And then Epic Gamer, thank you for coming to member.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
I appreciate it.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
All membership streams resume on the last week.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
And I will make up for any missed streams.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
I promise.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Oh, it's all coming together.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Oh, sorry.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Wait, how to...

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Check it out.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You can see it coming together.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
We've got weekly here.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Oh, someone had it.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It was like that.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
I don't want to interfere too much.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I feel like I'm going to sabotage it.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, no.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Oh, no.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Is this game what I think it is?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Is this game what I think it is?

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Hold on a minute.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Oh, no.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Okay.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
We've got the games together.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Oh, the games are coming together.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh, we've got get educated, get educated,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
get educated, get educated.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Plop, plop, plop.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
We've got a supermarket simulator.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
What remains of Edith Finch?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
That was a recommended game.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Kent Quispy.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I'm blue, diva, diva, diva.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Wait, why'd I forget the tune of that?

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm blue, abadi, abadi, and I'm blue.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I would die if I would beat off a guy.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Thank you for the membership extended.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
I have no idea.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I still want to say

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
about that.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I'm like, yes, membership extended.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Oh, what do I see?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Ring for adventure with a heart rate monitor.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
Well, I've got a collab with someone.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Who have I got a collab with?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Oh, I'm sorry, Refling.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, down here.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah, yeah, chase each other.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Chase each other.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Yay, you did it.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
You did it.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Thanks for subscribing again.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And subscriptions all over you.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
If I were green, I would die.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
If I were green, I would die.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Hey, Stony, we can see the finished puzzle

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
in the top left corner.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Oh, no.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
No, don't cheat.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
It's supposed to be a surprise.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh, no.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Oh, no, it's a cheat sheet at all.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Oh, no.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
It's supposed to be a surprise.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
No.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Wait, you guys hear the whole time?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
You just let me be happy in my ignorance?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Okay, I'll be happy in my ignorance.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Like it's me.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
And I'm going with my little heart pose.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
I love that pose.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
I might unironically ready to commission that pose.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
Like with my hand forward and then the other one like...

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
The only problem is this bit here,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
it gets impossible.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
That's why I was worried about doing a thousand pieces.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Because in it, it's just darkness.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
There's literally no logic to this section whatsoever.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I mean, the best I can do is like just try and force it.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Oh, sorry.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I don't know who that was, but sorry.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Wait, what, Mummy?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
You will play Sukiya?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Maybe?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
So every beat you were hit,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
like remember when Sukiya came out

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
and everyone was going fucking...

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Oh, oh, ah, ah, ape shit over it?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
And I was like, you know what?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I want to see what the big deal is.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And apparently it's just a short and sweet game.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
There's nothing too hard about it or nothing.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Whoa, Sukiya?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Isn't that Sukiya?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Suka?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Se'u?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Eka?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Um...

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Mods...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Saw his...

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Jiggle his soul.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Suika!

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Se'u...

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
What did I say?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Se'u-kiya.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Sukiya.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Danlos by the Ring Fit...

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
The Ring Fit Adventure Squad record?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You know it, boo-boo!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I don't know what the endurance thing is, but...

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Right, we do have a lot of...

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
No, this is where it gets difficult.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Right, we have a date.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
We've got the 18th, so...

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Uh, what's the day's date?

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
15...

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So it'd be 16, 17, 18.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
Um...

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
So...

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Uh, oh no, it says Wednesday.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Okay, so we need to find Monday.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
That's Tuesday.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Alright, we've got Monday here.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
Um, so we can start with Monday and Tuesday,

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
and then we can start putting the games in the order...

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
that they...

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
start in.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I've got a date with Momaya, later, Virgin.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Are you holding on to a date?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
No, you know.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
No, there it is.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Look, it's on the move.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
So Monday needs to go, like...

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
somewhere here.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I don't know where, but somewhere here.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Sorry, Strontium.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
My pre-order can't handle the puzzle website,

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
so I can't play along without your stream lag and heavy.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
I'll have to spectate.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I'm so sorry.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Aw, don't worry.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I'm sorry that, um...

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I thought this would be a relatively easy one

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
to, like, stream snipe on.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
But I know not all PCs are built equally.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
That's okay.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
Now this one, the time and then the dates

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
is gonna be a really hard section

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
because I always stream at the same time.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm not sure how easy it's gonna be.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
I'm just trying to see if there's anything obvious.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Now there is a bit of pink text.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Ooh, sorry.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
There is a bit of pink text.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
Where do I need some sort of purple hue on this side?

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
Is there anything with a purple hue?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Oh, here!

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
This is the very piece I've been needing.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Ta-da!

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm just so smart.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
See, I helped!

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I did one!

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Turn off GPU rendering.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Stony please.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Suki again.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Call it Suika.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Suika.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Oh!

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Aw.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
You found it out now.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Drawing gen 2 suggestions.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
I kept my word.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Oh no!

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Did I just take my meds?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Hello?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Hello, reflings?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Did I just take my meds?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Oh no!

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Hold on.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Did I need a refresh?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Refresh?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
There's no refresh.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
Oh no, we're back.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
We're back.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
I was like,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
still there.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Okay, we weren't real.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
No, don't say that.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
I think it's sad enough in Elden Ring when we finished our boss

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
and then you guys despawned instantly.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
A repopulation.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Whoa, did I just take my meds?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
I don't take my meds for you.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Right, we've got Monday.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So Monday has to go.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Okay, I guess not.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh, there's a Wednesday.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Well, we can bring Wednesday under Tuesday.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, sorry.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
No?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I'm trying to help,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
but I think I'm making a worse refling.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Right, where's Tuesday?

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Tuesday's here.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
I'm gonna bring...

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I think the lag isn't helping.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Oh no, wait, what?

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Where's Wednesday?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Where's Wednesday not just here?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
I'm gonna go crazy.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Oh, there's Wednesday.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.000
No?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
No, there's more wait now.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
There's Friday if I'm Friday.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I'm helping, I'm helping.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Right, where's the rest of Friday though?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
He took my piece and left.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
No, I'm here, I'm here.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Where's my thigh?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Look for a really...

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Oh, there's Friday.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
I found Friday.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Oh, so wait, someone's doing something down here with it.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Where's my thigh?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
There's like a big chunk of my thigh missing.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I'm gonna go look for it.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Hold on.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Look for a really pale piece.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
I don't see it.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Oh no.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
I lost it.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Someone's holding on to my thigh piece.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
I'm eating the thigh.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I'm sucking on it right now.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Right.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Hold on, what's going on here?

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Oh, this is a bottom section of one of these.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I can see it.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Where is that thigh?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I genuinely can't find that thigh piece.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
It would be so bright compared to all the others.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Eclan.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
What?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Hold it.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Who's holding that in red?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
You know I can kick whoever is trolling.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
If you just trolling, I am going to kick you.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm not.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
I'm not here for the troll.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I just want to have fun and play puzzle.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
They chopped too hard.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
It's not missing.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
What, you guys saw it?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
I can't see it.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
One second.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I don't know what it's going to come up with when I block someone.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Sorry, but please don't troll, darling.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
We're just here to have fun.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
I am blocked.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
I will kick from games.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
Please don't troll.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
I'm just trying to have fun, goobers.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Oh, someone found the thigh piece.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Wow, look at my juicy thighs.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
And look at this.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
I've got like a little armpit here.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
And I've got my eyes and my little shells.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
And my little spikes here.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
I love my little spikes.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
I love my spikes that come like here because it's very, very cuttlefish-esque.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
And then my little spikes here, which is also cuttlefish-esque.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Is it that?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Hmm.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Sorry, I think I keep accidentally moving it.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
I'm not sure.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I see the shells.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I see all the-

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
It's going to be so hard to do these ones.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
They're like impossible to decipher from one another.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm so sorry.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I just heard my dad blow his nose.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Sorry, I just heard my dad blow his nose.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
He's not very well.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Mummy's left ball?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
What are your names?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Stronny's armpit?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
You guys are ridiculous.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Stronny's building?

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
Building what?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
What am I making?

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Building what?

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
It's my question.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Hi, everyone.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Hi, replay.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Good morning.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Oh, well, you guys are doing it.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
You put together my schedule.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
Yeah, these color pieces are going to be a bit more difficult.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Oh, I did it.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
I helped a little bit.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh, hold on.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
I'm just going to try it in all this space.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh, I just connected two pieces together.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Oh, I think I saw where it matched.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
Yes.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
We're doing it.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Reflings, we're doing it.

28:38.000 --> 28:43.000
If we just force it, then it works.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
It just works.

28:45.000 --> 28:50.000
I know you shouldn't really force things in a tight small hole,

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
but yeah, I think it works.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Reflings strong together.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
I'm excited to get slapped this week.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Best part of the art is the drawing being out, yeah.

29:09.000 --> 29:13.000
Let's see what I was doing.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
Maybe one up here.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Yeah, I ain't got that.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
I don't have the reaction time to see who's doing that to ban them.

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
I feel like you guys are all getting frustrated with one another.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Mod's a precious man still.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Right, we do have like one...

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Oh, no, I lost it.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Oh, I found it.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
I was worried about that.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Oh, sorry.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
I'm touching the same piece as someone else's.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Sorry, refling, I just...

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Me and this refling just held hands.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Later.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Later.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
Here?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
No, not there.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
Maybe that one?

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
I'm starting to feel that we might be getting frustrated at one another

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
and shaking the puzzle a little bit.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm just getting that slight indication.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
I'm not sure if my theory is founded at all.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
But I think, perhaps...

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
I've locked this thing seven times.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I can't focus.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Oh, my connection!

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
No!

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
My connection's gone again!

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
I think if you move around too much, it's killing the thingy.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Hydration checked.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
We are so cool.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I mean, you can tell what I'm doing, right?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I think we know what we're doing.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
What should I...

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Maybe, wait, next time I'll make it, I'll see if I can like lock it or something.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I don't know.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Oh, no, my connection.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
It's trying its best, refling.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Oh!

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Oh, it's back.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Ta-da!

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Oh, look out.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I'm helping, I'm helping.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Did you do it?

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Oh, sorry.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Well, guys.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Yay!

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
It's my schedule for the week!

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
That's right, I put you to work for it.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
When other VTubers hand it to you so willingly,

31:25.000 --> 31:29.000
I raised your IQ levels by doing the puzzle.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
Yatta!

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
Okay, so for next week's schedule,

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
I'm drawing your nasty Gen 2 suggestions.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
I already know I'm going to get a slim girl.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
I'm going to have to sit and actually develop her.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.000
And we get to name them as well.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
I asked Mercy.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I'm going to give her a sister.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I had five hours sleep,

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
but speaking of less sleep,

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
is her still awake, I think?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
Hm.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Monk is.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Or maybe she's asleep, I don't know.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
She might be asleep and it was an old message I read, but...

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
Yes, we are going to draw Gen 2 together.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
I have to do your suggestions.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
Mercy was very kind.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.000
I asked her,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Oh no, we got kicked!

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Okay, we got kicked, that's fine.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Scores!

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
Oh my God, let's see who does the most.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
Hostrooms can't be kicked now.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
Force anonymous restrictions, game mode.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
How autistic are you?

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Pieces will be neatly arranged,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
appeasing the autists?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
We got kicked, that's rude.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I think I did self destruct,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
that's why I just in case.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Oh wait,

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
now I need to actually put up my schedule on screen

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
to talk about, hold on.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Wait, I need to put my schedule up one second,

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
I'm sorry.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
One moment,

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
okay, I need to talk about my schedule.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Boom!

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Oh, well, yeah.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
It's a bit bigger than I was anticipating.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Okay, there we go.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
This is my schedule for next week.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
So yes,

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
tomorrow,

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Mercy gave me the basis of what she used

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
on her alternative design and stuff.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
And then the day after,

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
I am making a PowerPoint presentation

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
on my special interests,

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
and you're getting educated along the way.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.000
Okay?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
Yes,

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
I'm going to teach you things

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
and stuff that I like,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
so you're being forced to get educated.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
And then we're going to try Supermarket Simulator.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
It seems like a small two hour game.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
I'm going to watch Azura play it

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
because I don't know what the game is about.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
I've never played it,

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
but I've seen a lot of Etubers play it.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
If it's not short,

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
it might get substituted for this like road

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
game where you have to try and get the car

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
to go as long as possible.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
But,

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
you're like,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Strongly Restrictions Disabled Image Preview,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
so it's a surprise.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Yes, sir.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Okay.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
It might be the long drive.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Yeah, I don't know if Supermarket Simulator

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
can kind of infinitely go on,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
and I need to wrap it up.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
I've got Ring Fit Adventure

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
with my heart rate monitor.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
My heart rate monitor is here.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
So I wanted to give it a shot.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
See how I do in my fitness levels.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Probably shite, let's be honest.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
And then we're playing

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
If that's how you guys want me to pronounce it.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Oh, Supermarket Sim can be easy endurance.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
A lot of clapping in that stream.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
I mean, if you want it to be, yes.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
Oh, it's an infinite game, Supermarket Simulator.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
You won't overdo it on this time on Ring Fit.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
No, it's like two hours and done,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
maybe even an hour and done.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Like, I don't want to be too loud for my dad.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
He really does not feel well right now.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
After stream, I'm going to check on him,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
and I think I'm making him food.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
I don't know if I'm about to do the old chicken soup.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Chicken noodle soup for him, I don't know.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
But we're playing Ring Fit for two hours,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
and then the next thing we're playing,

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I'm not going to say it right, ever.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
It says,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
for two hours,

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
and then I'm going to go offline for a little bit,

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
and then at Azura's usual stream time,

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
me and Azura are going to play We Were Here.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
It's like a free puzzle game,

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
so I'll be curious to see if we can get through it or not.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
I have played it once before,

36:25.000 --> 36:29.000
but I don't really remember too much of the details.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Wow, thank you for becoming a member.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Like, Lux, you get me educated, get me educated,

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
get me educated, blah blah blah.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
The goats.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Suica.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Suica.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Then the stream snipe game is Mario Kart 8.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
Now, before you're like,

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
oh, I can't wait to ruin you in the video game.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
I promise you, I have absolutely nothing to offer in the video game.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
You will win.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
I will be pleading with you to wait at the finish line.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Fiendish, thank you for the extended membership.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Mummy up...

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
Mummy Square 2? Up 2?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Mummy Up 2.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
What does that mean, Mummy Up 2? What are you up to?

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
But Mario Kart is a stream game,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
and I picked it on a weekend.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I was very dumb and didn't pick a weekend

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
for the Jelly Bean game,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
but we do it on weekends.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Mario Kart's subspace game, then no!

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Stop the press!

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Oh, God, we got a score.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
The Sunday Driver, honestly.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
My dad's asking me.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
He's like, are you going to learn to drive?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I'm like, no, I like my bike.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
And then a game that was recommended to me by you,

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
The Reeflings, is What Remains of Edith Finch.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Apparently, it's like,

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
super-sure two-hour game type thing.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
So everything is planned for two hours this week,

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
except for the We Were Here collab,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
because that's like a go-off,

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
and then a comeback on again.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Didn't Amy play that?

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
I couldn't tell you if she played Edith Finch.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I'm not sure.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
Okay, let me get rid of the schedule.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
And then let me do the next puzzle.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
What do I make you do?

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
Would you rather Strony and Mercy, AC or Amy,

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
or, wait, sorry, Strony and Mercy,

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
or AC and me, or Azur and Sheeby.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
What would you prefer for this forbidden artwork

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
that has never seen the late a day?

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Strony and Mercy, okay.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
I can't believe it.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
Okay, Strony and Mercy.

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
I'll do 450 pieces, I think.

39:03.000 --> 39:15.000
I think this is what I was supposed to do.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
Now, I have hidden the artwork.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
So before you're like,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
oh, I don't know what it is.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
You ain't supposed to.

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
You're not supposed to know what the artwork is.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
So it's an actual challenge.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
And I thought you were going to be a challenge.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
Good luck.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
So there isn't a background,

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
so I had to add a green and purple hue into the background

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
to make it even more challenging for you.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Now, I don't think any of these artworks were posted.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
As far as I'm aware, they've not been posted.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
For one reason or another,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
we'll not go around to it.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
It's not really been a moment to annoy each other with it.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
I must go stay strong for the plot-plot-plot roofling.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Oh, thank you for hanging.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Please don't worry.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
Is there an option for two pieces only?

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
A wee bit of a cheat sheet at all.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
Take the edge pieces to the respective edges.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
Oh, we've got the tactics coming in.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
There is no way.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
You already have a corner of green.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
That's insane.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
I think they've already figured out that I'm on the left side.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
I don't know. I'm getting the indication the rooflings have figured out

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
I'm on the left side. I repeat.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
I'm a professional edging. Don't worry.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
Oh yeah, it's edging time.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Well, you post the artwork there.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
Of course, I'll maybe get Mercy to post it

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
so she can get the Twitter interactions for it.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Because I'm not fussed for Twitter.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Honestly, on Twitter, I'm like,

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
I'm making prego ASMR. Here's the picture.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
And then like, oh my god, thank you for 10,000 subscribers.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
We got in a debut highlight

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
from a previously established clip channel.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
And oh my god, everyone's blown ahead in subscribers.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
I actually do have good news about anyone who does clipping

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
and has an established channel.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
We, on August 1st, the Allure

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
are going to...

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
the Allure.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Alluring.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Are going to release a clipping program

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
where you get paid for posting clips

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
if it, you know, like $1 per 1000 views type thing.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
Oh my god, why is it so tiny?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Hold on.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Is that the bottom of it already?

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
Well, you can kind of see Mercy and me coming together, huh?

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It was such a well put together cut.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Did you see it?

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
It literally propelled us ahead so much.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
And I'm so thankful.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
So I'm very ha...

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
Oh my god, the puzzle's tiny compared to how many pieces are on the damn thing.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Hmm.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Maybe I've made this too easy?

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
I mean, you can see me here.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Excuse me, you're doing what together?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
I don't know, you're going to have to do the puzzle.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
You're going to have to do the puzzle to figure out what we're doing.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
But yes, thank you for $10,000.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
I'm very excited to see how the ASMR stream's going to go.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I feel like I'm going to, like, rub the bathtub

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
and everyone's going to be like,

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
oh, my ears!

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
And I'll be like, yep, that's kind of what happens when you're in a bathtub.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
Could you imagine it's an alternative puzzle?

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
As much as I would adore to do that?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
No.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Oh, look at me!

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Hi, me.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
Oh, you can see one of my side details and stuff.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Oh, there's my abdomen.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
I can see Mercy's belt here.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
This is like Mercy's belt.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Oh, my God, Mercy has a belt, yes.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
I know you're normally looking at her bowl area.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
Oh, look, see, this is Mercy's collar here.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
They do such a casual thing.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
They are holding hands!

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I showed that video with the clips on my friends

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
and he subscribed all together.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
Literally, when we finished the AC collab,

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
she hit 6,000 subscribers.

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
And I think, like, she's blown past that.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I mean, I celebrated 10k.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
It says I'm at 10.7.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
I'm like, oh, my God, the ASMR debt increases.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
I'm like, hmm.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I think the scoring might be skewed

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
because the points are going to the slotted thingy.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Oh, yeah.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Okay, see, Mercy's...

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Oh, I apologize for y'all, I'm high.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I got five hours of sleep today,

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
but I'm going back to...

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I'm going back to bed.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Oh, no, I've got the Yumi watch along.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
Yumi plus have a concert today.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
I could maybe get a nap before it.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
I mean, what happens if I had a nap on you, Refland?

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
You're just so hot and warm to lie on.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
And then you pet my hair and I fall asleep

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and then you can violently wake me up

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
for the Yumi plus concert watch along.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I think that would do quite...

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Oh, what are me and...

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Oh, what's going on?

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
Me and Mercy, what's going on here?

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Hmm.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
There's a finger being pointed at Mercy.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
Wait a minute, there's a finger being pointed at me.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
What is this artwork all about?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
A concert of what?

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Is it heavy metal?

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
I don't think they've done heavy metal.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I don't know what they've done.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
But...

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
That's a cosy tube.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
Is cosy tube fucking stream sniping right now?

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
Is someone ERPing is cosy tube?

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Be honest right now.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
What?

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
Key signal.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
Thank you for the 50 gifted memberships.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
What the heck?

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Are you serious?

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
We're playing a puzzle game.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Thank you for the 50 bomb.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Holy moly!

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
What?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Thank you.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
Congrats to those who caught it with your face.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Thank you for the 50 bomb.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Big massive balls doesn't say anything.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
Key signal, absolute Chad.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Thank you.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Congrats to those who got it.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Have you seen the Shibi stream?

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
I saw the start where they read the first script

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
to say that the script master got an absolute bollocking

45:58.000 --> 46:02.000
as an understatement.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah, he got an absolute bollocking.

46:06.000 --> 46:15.000
Don't get me wrong, it was funny and it made good, hilarious clips.

46:15.000 --> 46:24.000
But I paid, you know, substantial money.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.000
I don't, yeah, so don't worry, don't worry.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Glorps your giggles.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
No, don't start it off again.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
I don't even want to know.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
I listened to Emi and Shibi do it, like,

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
and then it's the thing.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Oh, Stronys chair.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
That was so good.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Mummy's left ball.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
I don't.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Stronys gaggle stick.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Are you serious?

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
I just read that.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
No.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Oh my God.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Congrats on everyone who's catching the membership, by the way.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
You have emotes.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
The more emotes are coming.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
I repeat, more emotes are coming.

47:02.000 --> 47:07.000
Shibi, I had to go on her account and Shibi has, like,

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
20 missing emotes slots right now.

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
She's got so many emotes she can commission.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Hi.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Hi.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Thank you for joining.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
We're playing a puzzle game.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
If you click the link below, not only do I get your IP address

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
so I can come to your house late at night

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
when I need to take my frustrations out on you

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
after losing Valtro,

47:26.000 --> 47:32.000
but you guys have done it.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
What do your elf eyes see, little reeflings?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
Real.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
No.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Okay, you may just get access to the puzzle game.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
Oh, sorry.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Wait a minute.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
Why are me and Mercy fighting?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Do you want to know why we're fighting?

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
Because I want to kill you because I'm a siren

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
and she wants to kill you because she's a yandere

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
and we're both fighting over who gets to kill you.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
That's why I commissioned this artwork.

48:04.000 --> 48:11.000
Because we're fighting over who gets to kill you.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
I'm not even kidding.

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
That's the context of why I commissioned this.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I'm like, no, I want to drown him.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
And she's like, no, I'm a yandere.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
I have the right to perish him.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Oh, my God.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
So that is that one.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Did you like it?

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
It's us together.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
This was very early access.

48:32.000 --> 48:38.000
Before we had nail polish and bandaid designs and such.

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
But yeah, no, no, no, it's true.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
That's true.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
Very kawaii ne.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Reconnecting.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Okay.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Next one.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
You're not allowed.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
No peeking.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
No peeking.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Right.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
You can have AC and Emmy or you can have Azura and Chibi.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
What's your choice, darlings?

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Do not giggle sticker puzzle thing.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Honestly.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Kawaii Disney or something.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Yes, exactly.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Kawaii Disney.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Thank you again for the 50 gifted memberships.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
That was an incredibly kind key signal.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
You absolute Chad comes in, gives memberships, doesn't say a thing, walks away.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
You want to do who...

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Oh, you guys are actually split.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Oh, but I've got Azura.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Okay, okay, okay.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
No.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
You guys are going to like this one.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I'll do 450 because I don't want to...

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
I don't want to take up all your room, you know,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
blaze it and all that jazz.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Because we've actually...

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
It's already been an hour and we've done two puzzles.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Wait.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Have we only done two puzzles?

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Are you squidding me right now?

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Bubba the Great, thank you for the extended membership.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
We survived the first month.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Let's go.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
Yay.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Thank you.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
Okay, new puzzle, puzzle time.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Boom.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
I want to double boom.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
And you come.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
And you come.

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
So this is a sheebie and Azura artwork together.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
The preview has been disabled.

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
So please have fun with what happens next.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Oh my God, look at you go...

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
Oh my God.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Actually, can I say something really weird?

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
I really like watching ant videos.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
You know those people that have ant videos

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
and show the colonies going to work

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
and how well in that they do?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I think it's really fascinating.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
And I really enjoy it.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
And I'm kind of getting those vibes.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Oh my God, you guys are doing really well.

50:42.000 --> 50:48.000
I wanted for my doughnathon to maybe have an ant habitarium.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
But I don't think I can do it.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
Let's start edging, bros.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
Ant eater girl for Gen 2.

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
Well, tomorrow is when I do all my goofy Gen 2 streams, okay?

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
If you guys want to continue to do puzzles

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
after my planned ones are done,

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
I can do the thumbnails if you want.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
They're not the most exciting thumbnails.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Can't win them all.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Also, hey, I just got here.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Hi, hi.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
Don't worry, don't worry.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
We're just ants.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
No, reflings, that's not what I meant.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
I mean, just look how efficient you are.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
This is actually really pleasing to my brain to watch.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
Literally, they're so well coordinated.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
It's proof that you share a brain.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
Oh, we've got Azura in Shibi's face.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
I was going to say, I'm going to give you a hint.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Azura is on the, I've colored, the background is colored

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
to what their color is.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
So yeah, Shibi's on the red and Azura's on the purple.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
Purples.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
I like the taffy sounds a lot.

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
I have to go for now, but I'll try and come back later for now.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Bye bye.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
Thank you for hanging.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
Please don't worry.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
I can't believe she hates us and wants to be a parent.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Oh, it's my lore.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
You forgot my lore.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
I want to end all of humanity via hypnosis.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
No, that's me who has yet to freaking upload a serious hypnosis video, bruh.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I need to do it.

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
I'm not beating the accusations of how rubbish a hypnosis is,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
but I said, like, when my dad goes home,

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
I am going to be glued to that recording booth.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
I'm not even kidding.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
I have so much to catch up on.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I have so many...

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Sorry, I'm just putting this back to the start.

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
I have so many ASMR collabs to finalize

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
because I do not want to accept any more.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Oh, it's coming together.

53:02.000 --> 53:06.000
But what is Azura and Shibi doing?

53:06.000 --> 53:09.000
What are they doing in this picture?

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
I just remembered the hypnosis in the bagpipe short, honestly.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
We're going to be under a spell.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
It's inevitable.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
They're hugging something.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
What are they hugging?

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
What are they hugging?

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
They're going to figure it out.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Who knows?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
The reeflings are working hard and diligently.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
Well, I just realized how awkward it is to do Shibi's hair in a puzzle

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
because it's just like the wippy lanes.

53:42.000 --> 53:48.000
The look they're giving me making my jiggle song.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Shibi, you're done.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
I'm not reading any more of that.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Whoopsies.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I mean, you guys are getting there.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
I think you're going to be able to figure out what happens next.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
You're getting close.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Now, to give you a help in the background,

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
the Veiler logo is in the background.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Just to give you a helping hand.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
So there's a text in the background that says Veiler,

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
just to make it a bit easier.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
It is, yes, copyright free Zelda music.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
How dare you identify my peaceful.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
My peaceful.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
Oh, it's stalled.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
I don't know why.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Oh, there we go.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
That was strange.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
I don't know why that broke.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Okay, it's back.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
I'm sorry.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
I'm sorry.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Your peaceful music is back.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
I apologize.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
She thinks she still needs to spell it and chance me.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Oh.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
Is it supposed to be us?

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't know.

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
I don't have to come on in and help the puzzle.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
I see a lot of blue for his hair.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Yes.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
When feet.

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
I didn't have a feet picture in mind.

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
I was going to show a heavily censored artwork I got on myself,

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
but it was pretty outrageous.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
I have to admit.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
There's three brief ones were jumping me.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Let's just say that's what the artwork was.

55:03.000 --> 55:08.000
They were jumping me.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
Both their hair is a puzzle on their own.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
Honestly.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
So when are you going to release puzzles?

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
Oh, you went like an actual physical puzzle.

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
Honestly, a micro puzzle would be adorable.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
I don't care what anyone says.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
I think a micro puzzle would be adorable.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Jumping you affectionately.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Yes.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Very affectionately.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
Very, very, very engaging, if you will.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
A word by that marriage.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I think it would be cute.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
Maybe I can order custom puzzles and be like, hey, I have like 100.

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
I mean, you guys are getting there.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
You're getting very close.

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
Now, a remainder that Azura has weight on her ears.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
She has gooped ears.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
So maybe that's a bit of a hinge.

56:04.000 --> 56:11.000
As always, Madame has her lovely suit.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
Throughout Heaven and Earth, we are the jumping ones.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
The reeflings are me, myself and I.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
I cannot wait to write that pregnancy script.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It's going to be the most wild thing.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
And before I get so passionate about it,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
it's like a one hour long like sleep aid audio,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
but like I talk for the first 30 minutes.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
And then like we have a nap together whilst you're in my tummy.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
I can just see me getting so passionate when I write about it.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
I'm not even kidding.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
I'm so happy I get to fucking make pregnant with you ASMR.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
Like, ah, this is exactly what I want to do.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
I don't want to be serious.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I don't want to be trihard.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Double heartbeat ASMR.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Boom, boom.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
A bit too affectionate maybe.

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
Hydration check reeflings.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
I'm having to drink water.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
No tea.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
I'm having no tea today because I need to...

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Oh!

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Oh, reeflings.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
What do you see?

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
We're getting edged with the last piece.

57:15.000 --> 57:22.000
Any Azura and Shibi fans?

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
Is that you?

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Be honest, reeflings.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
Is that you in the middle and enjoying the embrace?

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
The big embraces?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Yeah?

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Yeah, you enjoying the embrace?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I'm glad.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
That's me.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Hmm.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Where's Azura's hand reaching to?

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
You don't worry about that part.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Okay, that part comes later.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I'm being hugged by the wrong woman.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
The outline makes me think it's throwing me.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Hmm.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Four big personalities collide.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
Being spoiled by Madam and Mama is the best.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Yeah.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
Okay, now last but certainly not least.

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
Once this expired is a Emmy and AC together.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Being so adorable.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
Let me just hide my screen so you guys don't get any spoilers to what's ahead.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
But here is AC and Emmons.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
Again, we'll just do 450 please.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Because it's a good...

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Or I think it's a good number.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
It's not too difficult.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
It didn't take too long.

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
And the room can be found.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
Pe-A-Z-Z-L-A.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Ta-da!

58:53.000 --> 58:56.000
Now this is a Emmy and AC.

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
So orange and blue.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Yeah.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
Let's get...

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
On your marks.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Get set.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Spoiler, there's a screen.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
I must unfortunately decline the offer of that embrace.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
You can be hugged by any member of your luring.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Cheeky young.

59:29.000 --> 59:34.000
Okay, I think I might be really cheeky and after the stream go for a nap before the Yumi Plus stream.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Is that bad of me?

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Is that naughty?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I think it is naughty.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
I'm a sleepy baby.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I got five hours.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
Orange and blue.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Florida colours.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
No, movie poster colours.

59:49.000 --> 59:55.000
Remember that post that broke down that all movie posters are blue and orange hue?

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
It's only not if you don't wake up in time.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
We gotta quickly fin...

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
We gotta finish quickly to get her rims.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Oh no, don't worry about it like that.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It's not like that.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Oh, I see Emmy.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Emmy's being made.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But where's AC's face?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
I don't see AC.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Oh, there she is.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
She's starting to form over here.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
You guys are doing it.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Okay, we've got a border on AC's side.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
It's coming over.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I'm just gonna plop it down there, but Emmy is thoroughly...

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Well, I can see AC's cold in here.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Is that AC's belt, maybe?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Oh, I see Emmy's belt.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
See, Emmy has a belt like this.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
This is the wee piece here.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Oh god, I misunderstood me.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Said Emmy's being made.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
No, I have to...

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
That's an ASMR booth.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
No, in theory, the girls were conceptualised...

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
with us all together.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
No, you'll be full of energy.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So you can cheer as loud and proud for Yume Plus, honestly.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I'm so excited to see there.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Me asking them for notes like, hey, how did you do this?

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
By the way, not asking for no particular reason.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Like, hey, what did it cost?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
How did you do it?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I just need to know so I can do it for my girls.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
That'd be great if you can give me some insider knowledge.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I'd appreciate it.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Okay, what's going on?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Emmy, Emmy's coming together.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I see Emmy's tummy.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And she's got her hands together.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I know what's happening here, but I can see...

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Oh, look at the smugness on AC.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
What's going on here?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Veiler concert win?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I don't know, it depends.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But look at the...

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Emmy's brought to tears.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Why would my daughter...

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Why would my darling daughter be brought to tears?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
What is going on in this image?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
What is going on in this image?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Emmy with brown hair?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
No, she's ginger, I promise you.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
She's ginger.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I was so confused why she thought she was blonde.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I'm like, in what universe, my damn?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You are not blonde, my dearest.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
AC stealing her big bro?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
No.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
But you're putting the image together.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I think you'll be able to tell shortly.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I think you'll be able to tell shortly.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
What do you mean again, AC's big bro?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Emmy fake cries all the time, I'm not filled.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
She's probably on his pack.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
She still insists she's dirty blonde.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
She's ginger.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
If she wants to say she's dirty blonde, I'm not arguing.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
As long as she's happy, I'm happy.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But the concept is that she's a ginger.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
She's in denial, that's what she is.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Someone just guessed it.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
AC being taller.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
So if you didn't know,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Emmy is 140 centimetres.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But AC is 142 centimetres.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So what is this artwork portraying?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Hi, Elf.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Elf Jeff, what kind of profile picture is that?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Is that Doctor House is like a telly tubby?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
What is your profile picture?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Elf Jeff, thank you for becoming a member.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
But oh my god, is that Doctor House

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000
is a telly tubby?

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Yeah, oh my god, that was off.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Emmy Burley, no.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Emmy's not the Burley in this one.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
This is very...

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Thank you for becoming a member, I do appreciate that though.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Thank you for the support.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Hugh, Larry as Tinky Winky.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
House, I get.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
But I don't see the telly tubby.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
That means they don't look...

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Do not look like Tinky Winky nor Dipsy.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
What if it's AC with heels?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I don't know, I think AC is taller.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
What's this?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I was gonna say, I recognise this.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Right, this is AC's tummy, I can tell.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Oh sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Oh no, no, no, no, the meds, not the meds, not the meds.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Don't get digested yet.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Slow release capsules, slow release capsules.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Do not digest the meds, okay?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Do not digest the meds.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Old hair colour.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
She was sponding as a junior.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
My ex would say 2cm mirrors isn't that much.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Do we laugh?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Or is this kind of like a therapy confession?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Wait, what do we do in response to that refling?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Hello Bobbi, I apologise.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
No, no, don't apologise for being late, don't worry.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Point and empathise.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Oh boy.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
We pour one out for the whole year.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
No, don't worry about being late, we're literally just like giffing off doing some puzzles.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Point and cry.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Head pat the refling, head pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Okay, we're putting AC together, we've managed to do ME,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
but I guess because AC's face is sideways, you guys are struggling a wee bit.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Oh is someone trolling?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Hold on, I think someone's trolling.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
One second.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Oh, that's not very nice.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Here we go.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Ta-da!

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Ooh, pat, pat, pat, pat, put AC together.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Pat, pat, pat, pat, put other pieces together.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That is terrible.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Tiny, spiny, that is terrible.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Thank you for the tip.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
No, we're not doing that.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Oh, okay, I'll put the last one on myself then.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I think everyone disconnected, so technically I put the last piece on myself.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Ta-da! Look!

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So this artwork, now this was before I had the girls.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Again, this was before I knew who the girls were and how they're enjoying themselves.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But AC is two centimeters taller than me.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And AC has very wide hips and thigh ratio, whereas Emmy's quite plank-like.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
But I don't mean that as an insult, I mean like true to Patan.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Like she's not very curvy, whereas AC is rather curvy.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And she does have a little bit of something.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Ta-da!

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Very important detail for future collaboration.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
The two little babies arguing over who's taller, even though they're both totally, honestly.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
It gave me one moment.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Right, what have I got next?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Right, this one's going to be a super fast one because it's not the most exciting.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:50.000
This originally was going to be an artwork used for an ASMR video, but I can't use it because...

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Because ASMR on YouTube is rather odd at the moment.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I'm not really sure.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I'm not really sure.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Um...

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Wait, hold on, let me pin it.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Okay, there we go.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Patreon won't lay- oh no, Patreon will, but um...

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Yes, good luck with the artwork.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Now the artwork, I will give you a hint, is very awkward for the background.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Because the background is a spiral.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
So I've made this 240 pieces, so I've made it a lot less.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Image of lungs breathing?

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Yeah, breathing, basically.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
You'll see it once you put it together.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Oh, you've already got my face, hold on.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
No way, you're that fast.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
You've never even seen the image before.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
How are you so fast?

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Hello, it's me Anonymous.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Hmm.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
How are you so fast at making it?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
There's a 3D art.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
No way, you guys are that fast.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.000
As high as the background is really difficult because it's like...

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Everything's no mummy.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Oh, mummy's looking at the video.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
No, you can't prove it, no.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
There's no proof.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
There's only proof once you've finished the image.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
That Anon me, everyone in this lobby is me, I am Anon.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Wait, hold on, let me get out of the way, I'm in the way.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's strong in time, I love strong calls.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Hello, it's me Anonymous, there's the 3D art.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Anon me, everyone in this lobby is me, mummy.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Your tongue is...

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I can do it twice.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
I made this pose.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Hypnotizing as if you're licking.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I don't know, you're gonna have to find out, you're just gonna have to do the puzzle.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Anon, we are replaying.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I'm gonna see if I can lurk here so you can still see the in-game chat if you wanted to.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
You're licking us.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
This.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Okay.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I never got a custom 3D or asset.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I'm not really that fuss for like custom assets.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I hope the girls aren't disappointed with me because I never really did that.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Like some feature agencies like, oh here's a custom, like game and set up, custom microphone, custom...

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Like, nail asset and I'm just like, I can't really be arsed with that.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
If the girls want it, they can get it in their donor thoughts.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Which sounds terrible, but I'm like, I've never been fussed for it.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
It's terrible, I really shouldn't do it that way, but...

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
If I'm no fussed for it, the girls then they get it.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
What's this?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Oh, you cut my hair together.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I don't know how I did that on the first go, but I did it.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So this is called a jigsaw, yeah.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
And you can join in and have fun.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000
We'd let you hypnotise us and destroy humanity.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Yeah, I don't know if maybe my hearts have been softened by the reeflings

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
and I have been redeemed, if you will.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
And that I no longer wish to perish humanity.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I'm starting to think that I definitely am having a change of heart to my lore.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
So the reeflings have changed me for the better.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Their tentacles made all the difference and now I don't want to kill everyone anymore.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
All thanks to your tentacle reefling.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Yeah, I don't want to perish humanity anymore.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Maybe just hold us like cow.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Right, now this is where this gets really awkward because there's so many hues.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So many hues and my hair really doesn't help either.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
My hair makes this so awkward.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Pen up frustrations and wanting the world to end a timeless combo.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Stop, I will make that canon.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Stop, that's such a good lore edit.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Thank you tiny spiny.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I don't know how you guys feel about that, but maybe the reeflings softened my hearts

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and I realised the problem wasn't humanity.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
The problem was the high table.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
I am so down.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And instead of using my hypnosis to take them down,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I hypnotise you to take them down for me.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I would abs strongly wick.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Honestly, down with that, yes, update your lore.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
I just got timed out.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I think, I don't know if it's like breaking a bit.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Not all of humanity, just a handful of people.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Yeah, you use us.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Well, after you've taken down the high table,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I have all the time in the world to our word yet.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Oh my lord, it's like a dosion where the hero smashes the villainess into not being evil anymore.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Yeah, basically, I will commission that.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Please do not think I will commission that.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Maybe I could get like a proper dosion spread.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I don't know how much they cost though.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.000
So one shot dosions I think can run like, depending on how many panels you have,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
shy of a thousand, but like a full on spread.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
I don't even know where you'd commission that honestly.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Did I see that?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Is it moving your positions?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Is it actually telling me who's picking up and dropping out?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Okay.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Is it our word?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
If we like it, who knows?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
We don't know yet.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I know an artist who does 50 per page with four panels a page.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Yes, I think when it comes to Donothon.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
So, oh, I can't say that yet.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I can say it tomorrow.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I think I could say it tomorrow.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Right, I can't say it just yet, but I'll say it tomorrow.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
A screenshot when someone keeps moving it.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Oh my God, what is that?

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
This is giving me a stroke and not a good count.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
That's me.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
That's my thing.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I think it's lagging out, unfortunately.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
How do you even move the puzzle?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
It's not moving.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Let me just fix over here.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I'll take the high score off because I don't even see the score.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
The mods turned that wifling into Tokoyaki.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I came back to Crazy Talk.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
It's not Crazy Talk if it's my lore, okay?

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I'm allowed to have lore.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
No, that doesn't sit there.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Oh, I dropped my piece.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Oops.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Oh.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Yeah, we're lagging a little bit.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Mods, deep fry that wifling.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
We're breaking the site.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
It's taming out.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
It's the site taming out.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Oh, something about our wording.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It was a mis-

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
It was a mis-input.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
It was a mis-input.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
We're breaking the website stop.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
That's actually so funny.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I feel so bad, though.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Website owners.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
We're just having fun making puzzles.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
That's all.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
They're going to be like,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
who on earth is this weirdo licking the mic?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Because they can see the images as it's getting made.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
They'll be like, what is going on here?

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
So, originally, this artwork was going to be a subscriber milestone,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
but all of them are going to have to go on Twitter instead for free

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.000
because YouTube is stinky and it sucks.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Hello, I'm back.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Oh, my.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Yeah, look.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
So, I was originally going to use it,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
and the artist was really good

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000
because I was like,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
oh, can you just like make-

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
can you do something with a microphone

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
just so it's a bit more unique than a default?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Don't hold it.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
So, it was going to go on YouTube,

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
but it failed because YouTube is stinky.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
But that's my artwork, and it's me.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
And I'm so cute.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And then I asked for like some custom stuff on it,

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and they just like put me sticker on it.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I'm like, yeah, I'll take it.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
I don't think I had your model yet.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I don't think I had your model yet.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I don't think I had your model yet.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
I don't think I had your model yet,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
but if I do get a custom 3DO asset,

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I'm going to get you on it,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
and I'll be like,

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I'll get a little sticker here,

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
and then a little speech,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
and it says, I was R-worded,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
and you're all happy about it.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
There's something like that.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
I don't know what.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And then that's me with my little squiggly,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
wiggly eye.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I like the way it does.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Okay.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Now I do have...

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Hold on, I'm from my dad's birth.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I'm so weird.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Okay, let me hide it,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
and then we'll make a new puzzle, okay?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
It's so cute.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
It's so cute.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Thank you.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Okay, what's the image?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Okay, you have a choice of a meme or a comic strip.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Both involve all the girls.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Meme?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Or comic strip?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Your choice.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Dayler's choice.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Comic strip, meme, comic, meme, meme, meme.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Oh, meme one.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Okay, meme one.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Meme one.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Hold on.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I am going to do 450 pieces for this one,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
because it's got all of us in it, okay?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So don't be shy.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Do some more.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Let's see.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Generating puzzle.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
You ready?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I know it looks confusing.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Hold on, I'm putting the puzzle in chat right now.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Puzzle.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
This one slightly more difficult,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
but have a show?

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Have a show?

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Have a goal?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Have a show?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Have a show?

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Have a show?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Have a show?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Have a show?

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Have a show?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Have a goal?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I like that idea of being hypnotized is me to feel it.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Good luck with this one.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
This is not an easy one.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
My fingers is hard.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I love Johnny Cuddles.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I love Reefling.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Are you Reefling Cuddles?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Is that your full legal name?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Reefling Cuddles?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Yeah, Reefling Cuddles would be your full name.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Yeah.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
By the Pope.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Now remember, this is a meme.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
This is not an easy one.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Oh, some's already got the bottom corner credit for the artist.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
We'll take on your last name if you want us to.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Yeah.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Are we taking your last name?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Reefling Cuddles?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Pipe Jim, we could get a comic for the girls.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
That would be rad.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Yeah, of course.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I would never say no to that.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
If the girls want comics, I'll make them.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Someone out there is going to get a legal name change to Reefling Cuddles now.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
That would be pretty badass, sorry,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
but they would get my used panties in the mail or something,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
because that's so badass.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
No, do not actually legalize me for your name.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
We'd be taking your last name.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
We have no full name.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
We have the title, though.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Reefling the Ink Supplier!

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Reefling the Plentiful,

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Reefling the Bountiful,

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Reefling the Unending Ink...

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Ink...

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Reveal her dosion.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Let's go.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I would never say no to that.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Never say no.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Making a fake person a name in a mania?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
It's too late.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I've set it in stone.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
You've already contacted...

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Oh!

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I see Azura forming.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I see Emmy.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I see I see I see Azura on me.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Sorry, I'm punching the mic right now.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
My apologies.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Oh, the bottom.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
The bottom is starting to show hints.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Emmy.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I will very quickly move over

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
just so you can see the bottom is showing hints

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
of what this content is.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Punch again.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I'm not punching the mic.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Fade the mic.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Boom, boom, boom.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Resisting the urge to change the name change.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The name change...

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
No!

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Elden Ring Boss Drop.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Reefling the Bountiful.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
All the Vela girls have their own pills.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Nice.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Oh!

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
But wait, there's more.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
There's more to this meme.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Oh.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Oh wait, why does it...

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Well, I got bigger.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Yeah.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Again there.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Oh, what's this?

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Oh!

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Oh!

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Reeflings cracked the case on Azura.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I repeat, the Reeflings have cracked the case on Azura.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
What is this artwork all about?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Oh!

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Reeflings are doing it.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
They're doing it.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
They're doing it.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
They're cracking the case wide open.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
What is this meme all about?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
So is it for Gotham?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Alright, we got Azura packing up.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Rep it up.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Stream idea for fstreams?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Literally this, except...

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Yeah, no, I'd be done for that, that's hilarious.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Oh my god, we should do a puzzle on Bansley.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And then we have to all squeeze one out to it.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And then we wait 15 minutes and then we have to go next!

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
I'd be so down for that, that's hilarious.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Would you change your legal name for a Reefling snack?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I have to do it?

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
We have to like force ourselves?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
By the third one all of us are like, we can't go on.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Go on without us.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
There'll be one Reefling that's like, you guys are struggling?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Different kind of endurance stream.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Oh, the case is getting cracked wide open.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Oh wow, completely just sealed off the lower section of this meme.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I'm loving this, I'm so sorry if it's like low entertainment.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
I am adoring this, like revealing artwork via making you do logic puzzles.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
It is hilarious, I'm sorry, but it is.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Like, you will be rewarded with new artwork that you haven't seen before,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
but first you must do this puzzle.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
That's absolutely ridiculous.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Guys, can you solve a little sorority of rest, honestly?

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
It's like why old wizard riddles?

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Astority, this one needs to be poster wall art.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Oh my god.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
No.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Which one of these pills is piagra?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Stop!

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Why do they ask for which one?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
I think piagra's blue.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Surely.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I mean, you guys have done so well, that was not an easy one.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
You guys keep doing so well, I can't believe it.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
This is peak iPad entertainment.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Stop is actually.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
I'm taking the strony fell.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Yes, so this meme concept.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
So I ordered artwork of everyone stepping on the viewer.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Now, this was before Azura was finalized with her reference sheet.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Azura is a lot more chocolate in her concept art, and this is what the artist had to use.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And she's a lot, and she's not even got her markings and stuff.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
You know, this is older.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
But yeah.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And you can tell this one's older for me, because I have brown, like, apparel things that come out the back.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
That's when you know it's not my design.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Again, Shibi has lines instead of ropes, the classic.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Mercy, no nail polish.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:27.000
No one has nail polish at this stage of development when I ordered this,

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
but I was like, yeah, I want to step on new artwork.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I'm so red-pilled.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Skinny Azura jumpscare.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
I cannot tell you how many times I have to go to an artist and be like,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
make her plump.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
She's a mummy.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Literally, she has birthed all of humanity.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
She got them birth in hips.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
She got a tummy.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000
You know?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
What are you doing?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
AC censored me live in a society.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
It was very, there we go.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
You did it.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
You unlocked the meme.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Check it out.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Steps on you.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Okay, I believe I have one more artwork.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
But yeah, it was like, pick your pill.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
The purple, the green, the red, the purple.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Oh, we didn't think that.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Wait, what?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
The light purple, the lilac, I guess.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
And then the purple, the orange, or the blue.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Purple and purple.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Hmm.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Yes.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Maybe we should have done pink,

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
because Mercy does have a bit of pink in her design.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
That probably would have been wiser, but hey-ho.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Pink, but yeah, I would say pink as well.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
I'll take all six.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Are you going to half them all?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
An ironically great advertisement?

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Oh, really?

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
You like that?

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Wait, I'll get this changed to pink,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
and then we'll put it on the main viewer, kind of, or that.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000
And we're done.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Wait, hold on.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Let me just double check my files.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Oh, no, there's...

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Okay, there's an ASMR collab artwork with all of us together.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
It could have made you pink in her teal.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yes.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Hi, Fua.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
There's an ASMR collab artwork,

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
or there is a meme comic strip.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000
ASMR or meme comic strip.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I didn't see the other image that I had lurking in the shadows.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Hi.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
We need to see the art collab.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000
ASMR, ASMR.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Meme, comic, comic, comic, ASMR.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Oh, you guys are like 50-50 split, ASMR.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
All right, we'll do the ASMR,

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
but I'll do 250 pieces.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
250 blazes.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Great.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
This one has the Veiler logo in the background,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
just for simplicity's sake,

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
because again, it's one of those ones where it's rather on the odd side.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Puzzle.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Oh, I like this game where you put it in your own image.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Yes.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I highly recommend it for streams.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I'm currently leaking artwork that's never been seen before via puzzles.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I'm making them do logic puzzles in order to access it.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000
It's the most bizarre thing Fua.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
So you should consider it.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Rustic, thank you for the gen...

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Try again.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Thank you, Rustic, for the gentifted mentorship.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
What?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Hello, Rustic.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Thank you so much for the gifted 10 memberships to the channel.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Thank you.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I really appreciate that.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
And congrats to those who caught it with your face.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
What was that?

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I'm taking a drink of water right now.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Oh my gosh.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I'm taking a drink of water right now.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Oh my gosh.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I'm taking water.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
I need to...

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I think I'm having a nap after this one.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Thank you for the gifted memberships.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Oh my god.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I think I need a good sleep.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
But I'm okay.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I could not get that out there.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Gentifted memberfish?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
That's not what I said.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Nice.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
It's only just having a stroke.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I'm thinking about the bands these streams a little too much.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
But yes, Fua, I highly recommend leaking artwork

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
via making puzzle streams.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
It's absolutely hilarious.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Because I'm showing stuff that's not been shown yet.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
And it's just so fun.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Oh, we already have our canvas.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Now, it did make it a wee bit easier.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I didn't do too much.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Oh yeah?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Okay, I'm having the time of her life.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
The gentifted member.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.000
How did you jumble those words in perfect sequence?

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I do it quite often.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I can accidentally swat.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I take the first letter.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Oh god, I'm supposed to say that.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Knee die, Julie.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Thank you for the 20 gifted memberships.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
That's right.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
I said it right this time.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
What are you going to do about it, huh?

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Are you disappointed?

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Knee die, Julie.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
That I said it correctly.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
20 gifted memberships.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Okay.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Thank you so much.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I appreciate that.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
You guys are going to end up getting me another emoji slot.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You know that, right?

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm like, people are so fast.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I'm trying to get a single piece.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
That reflins are on it like a blood type.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
I did pick out 250 pieces for this one

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
because I didn't know.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Strongly struggling.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Strongly is struggling.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.000
But congrats to those who caught it with their face.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And you have access to all the emotes.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
There's more emotes on the way.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I promise.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I have 13 more emotes.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And give Mercy some room.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Please excuse me.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Mommy, the reflins are hogging the shared brain cell.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Oh, it's okay.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Sleepy Phoenix.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Thank you.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Thank you for the tip.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But yes.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I don't know what happened there.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I took a drink of water

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
and now I can speak all over again.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
So that's good.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
That's good.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000
We should make a thousand.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
It only goes up to 700, I think.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So this is the next group.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
ASMR collab.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
What do you think it is, reflins?

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
What do you think is happening in this collab?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I got one!

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Yippee!

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Are you squidding me right now?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Wait, that is so delayed.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
That is so delayed.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Thank you again, Sleepy Phoenix.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Are you okay, YouTube?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
You took a sec.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
I read that quite a moment before.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Do 1,000 rotated pieces

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
blowing air into our ears?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Not air.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Not blowing.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
A different kind of ASMR.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.000
A group kiss?

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
We're sniffing you ASMR.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
All six of us are sniffing you going

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
but it's binaural sniffing.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
So six binaural layered sniffing

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
and you're going to be pheromone maxing for us, okay?

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000
So that's what the next group ASMR collab is with us.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000
It's all about pheromone maxing.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I hope you're ready for it.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
The full sniffing experience.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
That's 12 nostrils to smell every little piece of you.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
No shower for a month, God, at the big sniff.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:29.000
God, I hope she likes my pheromone stink.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
With me, everything will be ready for it.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
But yeah, look, are you humping?

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Are you? Why are you gyrating the image?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Why are you doing this sexually?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Briefly.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Fucking steady.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
I need a bit of fire play.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Okay, yeah.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Oh, there is 1,000 pieces.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Okay, I don't think I'm going to do it on this image.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
There's images too difficult to do 1,000 pieces on.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
We'll do 450 pieces.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Let's see, 450 blaze it.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Great room.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Comic time.

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:19.000
So originally, I was going to release a monthly comic on Villalour.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Like, for the pro, I'm going to sneeze.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
That was really weird.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Puzzle.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Sorry, that was a weird one.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Bless you.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Thank you, Bill.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Aggressive sneeze, yeah.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I'm afraid I'm not.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Get out of my nose kind of sneeze.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Okay, now, originally, I was going to do a comic

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
every month kind of Villalour.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Fun.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Damn, she busted me sneezes.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Apparently, it's one-tenth of it.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Be aggressive on me however you prefer.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Yes, but the plan kind of failed through

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000
because it wasn't going to work out.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I need like a specific artist type for it

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
and I couldn't get a hold of one.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And then I got so busy with all the other issues.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Like I've kind of said, like debut was,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
the month of May was absolutely horrific.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Everyone went past deadlines.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Everyone, like when, even when I was getting sent stuff

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
that was complete, it was like,

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
it was like a joke because there was so many obvious edits

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
and fixes and subtitle issues or whatever

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
and it was just horrible.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000
So yeah, this plan got put on the back burner.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I'm not really sure.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I want to do unspeakable things with Strony Cuttles

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
or do you want me to do unspeakable things to you?

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.000
What one is it?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Quick.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
The Wheel of King.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
What?

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
There's no way you can see that.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.000
What?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Have I shown this before?

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
How could you have guessed that?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Amy, is that you on and all?

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Is that one of you guys?

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
How could you have guessed that?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
It's been a tough year at Commission Art.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It's not their fault.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I think everyone has taken a lot of work

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
because things are getting more expensive.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Well, yes.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Some artists unfortunately do over-promise on deadlines.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000
How could you have fricking guessed that?

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I don't know. Zoom in.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
We can read Mummy.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Oh, okay.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Yes.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
No, there was a lot of developmental issues

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.000
with Veilor behind the scenes.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I commissioned stuff well in advance

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000
and then it was announced that Veilor's debut was on June 1

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
and collectively, I kid you not,

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
every single artist that we were working with

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
saw that and then all of a sudden,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:01.000
my commission that was on track was getting delayed

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
past the deadline I had given

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
and it just became an absolute nightmare.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So don't be surprised that Gen 2

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
don't have an announcement date

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
until it's actually all ready to go

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
because I am not going through that stress again.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I literally almost developed a stomach ulcer.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
It was that bad.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I like Sheeby's chest has been put together.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Have you put her?

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:32.000
You've put together Sheeby's booba.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
But yes, this was just kind of like a test sample

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000
for the comics.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000
This was a draft, a sample, if you will.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I will give you a hint.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Mercy is talking to me in the first panel at the top.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
That is your hint for this puzzle.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Mercy and I are having a conversation.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I'm sorry it was so stressful.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I'm still amazed at the amount of what you did

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
to prepare for debuting yourself.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Yes!

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Everything got put on the back burner for me

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
to make sure the girls and everything was correct.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Oh, you've already done it.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Holy shit, you've already got a little scared.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Well, there you go.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
You got the comic outline.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Ta-da!

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Oh, it's gone.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
But I worked it in the end.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
That's the most important thing.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I am absolutely not telling any artists.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I'm just giving deadlines that are fair.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Anyway, lessons learned.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
It was a massive learning curve.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Honestly, anything new you do in life

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
is a massive learning curve.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So I'm glad that I had the opportunity to do it.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
It was a hoot and a holler.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
If curiosity, which of the girls can draw,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.000
all of them have some sort of drawing experience but me.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I am the only one that has zero skills.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Literally, my only skill is licking a microphone

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
and I stand by that proudly.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
That's all I got going for me.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
That and my addiction to reeflings.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That's what I got going for me.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Life's good.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
That's all I need.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
That's all I need.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Life is good.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
All her skill points went to specific games

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
and her tongue game, honestly.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
You're a great entertainer.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Oh, you stop.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Yeah, you're gonna make me blue.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Oh, that's not gonna stop you.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Your voice is hoot too.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
My actual voice?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I don't know.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I feel it in my eyes.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
That's what I feel like I sound like.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
That's what I sound like in my head.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Who said Farky?

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Oh, it's in the comic strip.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Sorry, it's in the comic strip.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
A master assassin.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
I am a master assassin in Assassin's Creed.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
The best game of all time, which we get to play

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
on December...

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.000
December, October 10th.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
That's your actual voice?

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Voice, I can't believe it dropped through.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
October 10th, we're playing Assassin's Creed

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
all over again and I'm so excited.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I'm so excited.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I just can't hide.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
And on October 8th, we're playing Assassin's Creed 2

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000
and then the next day, we're doing 100% feather run

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
and then we're playing Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
on my birthday, which I'm so excited about

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
when I get two days.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Well, it's gonna be a 40-hour event.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
It's crashing again.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Oh my god.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Am I allowed to fart? Excuse me.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Actually, I just want you all to know

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
that...

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Amy...

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I'm gonna out her right now.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Amy sent me two clips of her farting

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000
to be highlighted into a short.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
I did not go seek them out.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
She sent them because she was like,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
oh, this is kind of funny.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
I had to send a...

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
a new person that is working with Veal

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
or two clips of Amy farting.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I'm like, you know, I had to type up a message.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I'm like, hi.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Thank you so much for waiting on your first batch of work.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Here's a link to the clips

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
that the talent Amy has requested to be made into shorts.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
You have full editing rights.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
We're not gonna dictate it.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And the last two clips were her farting.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Did they think you were joking?

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
She took it on stream.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Oh, she took it. She took it twice.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
She forced it out.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I had to sit and review the clip

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
to send away to make sure it was acceptable

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
to be turned into a short.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
So I had to listen to Amy go...

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
and then a little took came out.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And then she's like, did you hear it?

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Did you hear it?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I did it!

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Like, she was so proud of herself.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Expelling that air from her guts, honestly.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
That editor, happy as Larry.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
No, the editor came back and was like,

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
crass humor like that doesn't normally land.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Amy not beating the allegations.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
That's so funny.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
She even made a face to...

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Where did you even find these girls?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
The girls found me!

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
That's the best part.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I'll be here.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
They were crazy enough to be like,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
yeah, I want to be a part of that.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And I'm like, oh, don't mind if I do.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
So anyway, again, as I said,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
this is just a draft concept of a comic strip

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
that we may or may not do.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
That's so funny.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
She's giving us a real girlfriend experience.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I feel sorry for the guy,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
but I love my little sister that, honestly.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
It's a crass noise, alright.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I don't have my...

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
I don't have my set on board open.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I'm just gonna have to do it myself.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Eh...

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Shawnee is a master reefling wrangler?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Oh yeah.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Ooh boo, tomato, tomato.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
How about speaking out?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Why am I all too ill all of a sudden?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Oh, that one was a whistle note.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Her LLE came out with me there.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
No one noticed yesterday,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Azura's horns and shebe's chest

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
with the little paper on top

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
give birth to the seventh...

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
What?

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
No one noticed, but yesterday,

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Azura's horns and shebe's chest

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
with the little paper on top

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
give birth to the seventh secret member of your...

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
What are you saying?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
I don't know what you're saying.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
What does that mean?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Now we just need a Shawnee to enclet...

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
No!

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Well, for my doughnut song, yes!

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
But in general, no!

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
During the VTuber review collab or something?

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Am I going crazy?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
The paper above a head?

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And there might be ways.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Who is...

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
You don't need to move the thing anymore,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Reefland.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Or is it just lagging out completely?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:38.000
It may be lagging out as well, so...

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Someone keeps shaking it.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I think it's definitely lagging out

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
because we've overloaded their wee servers.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
The lag makes me feel like...

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Ooh, so this is the first comic.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
I don't know if it's entertaining enough.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Maybe I'll get it professionally ironed out.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000
But this was, again, before I knew the girls

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
and the designs and all that jazz.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
American Idol.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Ta-da!

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
So the comic goes,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
So, if Vila doesn't do suspensions,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
how do you punish us?

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
And I say, oh, I just spin the wheel.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
The wheel?

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
If you misbehave,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
I commission artwork on whatever lands the wheel lands on.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And it's like all these, like, stuff

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
that you don't normally do.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
And everyone goes,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Well, babe!

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Because we don't do suspensions at Vila.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I have absolutely no desire to do it.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I think it's disgusting.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
So, yeah, that was my meme on, like,

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
this is what happened.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.000
This is what I do.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
And then that's my face all serious.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
That was my first draft of a meme.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I thought it was rather humorous,

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
but, yeah.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Oh, StrayPube.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Bro, when I figured out what StrayPube was,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
I was like, is this for real?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
But it's a real tag.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
It's funny.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Um, yeah.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Serious?

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
More like psychotic reaction image of StrayPube.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
If you misbehave, Reeflings.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Um, I think that's all the images I had to share.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Now, I could do my thumbnails.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
If you want, very quickly,

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
we could do my thumbnails for the week.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
They're not too exciting.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Um, would you like to do that before I go offline, yeah?

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
That's the one in the corner of the mouth, right?

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
I hate it.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
It depends.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I'm in the corner.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Yes, you want to do my thumbnails.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Okay, one second.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I'm just pulling them up now.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Shimmy, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, yeah.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Drank.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
How many thumbnails have I got?

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Now, I will make these smaller.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I think I'm actually going to go back on the Mario Kart one before.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Anyone's like, I'm really disappointed in that.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
That was my PC.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
That wasn't you.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.000
My PC takes like a whole five seconds to comprehend that it's just downloaded an image.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
It has such a hissy fit over it.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I'm definitely going to go back in the Mario Kart one and add you guys in it because...

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Right.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I'll try.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I'll test what 50 pieces looks like.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
I don't know, 50 is like far too easy though.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Okay.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
No, I feel like 50 is just...

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Fuck it, fuck it.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
We'll try 50.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Okay, we'll try 50.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
It's not a big deal because we have other ones to go through if we want, if we so desire.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Oh my God, this is far too easy.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
No, sorry, this is what I see.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Just so you know, this is what I see.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
That's far too easy.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
No, we're not doing that.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
We'll do 250, believe it.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
My apologies.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I thank you guys.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
My PC hates putting input.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Oh my God, it hates me.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Just so you know.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Only 50...

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
The wiefling is drowning.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Everyone does one piece each.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
We have to be organized like that.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Okay, these are the last...

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000
There's seven more to go, but these are the last puzzles.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
And then we're done!

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
We did it!

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
We did all the puzzles.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So you can see a little bit of text.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
You can see there's a red stop sign.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Maybe some sort of red stop sign.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I'm glad Mummy did this to me.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
She likes to do puzzles for other reasons.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Are you enjoying it?

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
I'm glad.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
I feel like it's so fun doing little insider stuff.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I definitely want to do this in the future

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.000
when I get more artworks for the girls and stuff.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Me leaking gen 2 via puzzles!

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Stop!

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Stop!

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
The reason I'm saying stop is because I'm dumb enough

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
to want to try and do that.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
No, I'm not leaking gen 2 designs.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Via a fucking puzzle game.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
So this is my first stream tomorrow,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
which is

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
drawing

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
your gen 2 suggestions.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000
So what would I put inside the big red sign?

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Alright, I'm lurking for the rest.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Kisses!

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Thank you for hanging and be playing.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Yes, I will wrap up the stream,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
and we will redirect into Shibu!

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Cotton bomb!

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Sorry, I'm having a big stretch.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
But this was so fun.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
This was such a little goofy stream.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Bye-bye!

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Bye-poo-ah!

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Thanks for being chinny,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
thanks for hanging.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Alright, I'll zoom in a little bit more.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
She hates slime girls.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Yeah, the sign says no slime girls.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
But I already know I'm going to have to draw one.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I already know I'm going to have to draw one.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Oh yeah, has anyone said Shibu

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
said she wants to try a G-mod?

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Oh my god, I need to buy the thing.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
I need to buy the game for real, for real.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Bye-bye-poo-ah!

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Thanks for hanging.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Thanks for completing the puzzle with this as well.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:18.000
It was fun.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Please do a puzzle stream

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
and link inside your art of your stuff.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Your content is so fun.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
I so recommend it.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Oh yeah, I really want to see the beat of a prop one.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I already,

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
I hate the feeling of being chased,

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
and I already know I'm going to be screaming

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
and excitement being chased,

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
but if I'm like hating as a prop

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
and like one of them susses me out,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
thank you for always being so nice and comfy to watch.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Oh thank you for, what the heck, that's so kind.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I've returned the compliments to you.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
You're always a cozy streamer too.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
I saw your post on Twitter

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
with all your nickel variations and that,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
and I was like, damn, you got some,

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
some alternatives.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
You got loads of stuff that you can do, which is fantastic.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Mum is screaming because of us.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
No, I'm not screaming.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
But the feeling of being chased

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
gets me like so excited and giddy,

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
and if one of the girls was chasing me in Gmodor,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
they know I'll be like,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
like I'll be like burst out laughing

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000
because I get nervous laughter with chasing as well.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I don't know,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
there's just something like primal in me

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
that gets activated.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Sorry, the red hue,

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I just realized how awkward the red hue is making this.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
There's so much red hue.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Actually, for an ASMR I'm working on,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
it's gonna be interesting.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
ASMR, you say?

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
3DO, you say?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Is that a collab on the horizon?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
No one will know.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
Teasing, teasing.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Mummy, you should look into primal play.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Wait, is that a thing?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Stop, hold on.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Am I about to get educated?

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Primal play.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Primal play centers around the raw feeling

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
and actions and natural impulses,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
especially urges.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
And while I understand you are the sub in...

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
What?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Oh, this is like an article.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Some people who do primal play switch roles

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
and chase them instead.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
What the fuck?

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Mummy's a primal play girl.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Stop, is that what I am?

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I just want something new.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
What do you think?

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Drawing Gen 2 suggestions.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
No slime girls!

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
No, who said 3DO, that's gonna...

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I mean, you know, I could just teach me how to do it professionally.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Oh no!

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Alright, I'll hit you up in the DMs boob and grill them

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
where I got you.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
And Neko this.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Neko needs...

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Neko needs pamper you to sleep.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Gotta make it rain.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Over like a window.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Viscous liquids girl.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
She smells fresh meat.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Article trying to call it.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Literally, I typed in primal prey.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Can I speak here anymore?

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Insight girl and goblin girls?

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
There's a lot of bang girls.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
You can ask for what you want.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
I will actually force myself to draw it.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
You're welcome.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Yeah, the DVD screensaver.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Artificial sea war girl, what does it mean?

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Right, I'm hiding it, I'm hiding it.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Right, next thumbnail.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
After slime girls, I've completely forgotten.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Oh, I'm educating you in my special interests.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Which you're not ready for.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Which I'm gonna have so much fun making.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Like I need to do like a big powerpoint presentation.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
That stream is gonna be so long.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
If I get carried away, that stream's gonna be so long.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Okay, next one.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Making her successors in Gen 2.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:49.000
The goblino reefling girl.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000
A reefling girl version?

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I feel like you guys are a reflection of me though.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I was gonna get a model update so I can lift up my bangs,

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000
my fringe, and then reveal the nicotine patch on my head as well.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
I love strony calls, I love strony calls.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Thank you, I love reefling.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Cuddles.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Cause that's your surname.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Strony, what kind of...

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
No, my autistic special interests.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Not those kind, not those kind of special interests.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
The autism kind.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
I'm gonna talk about seat dispersal.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I'm gonna talk about digestive tract.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I'm gonna talk about

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
socialization.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I'm going to talk about what life was like before capitalism.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I'm gonna talk about region locked capitalism,

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
which is feudalism.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
I can never say it right.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000
I'm also gonna talk about Freud.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
You know, because he was kind of right

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000
and people shunned him.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I'm gonna talk about what mother's special interests are.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
The other special kinds are in a different stream.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Feudalism, that's a feudalism.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
What kind of seats?

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
I'm gonna teach you about seats in general,

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
so you can learn.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I'm gonna teach you about how farming works

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
and agriculture and that kind of thing.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Freud was ahead of his time, honestly.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.000
That man was onto something and they shunned him

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
all because he had a cocaine addiction, okay?

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
What else are we gonna talk about?

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Probably

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
world war accounts.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Some information that you might not have known.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I'm gonna talk about the farming.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:44.000
How farming at home has disappeared.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Planting at home and growing your own veggies

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000
at home has disappeared.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
More like Sigma Freud.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Sigma, I mean.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Freud had a big speech on how he took coke before

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
and then the only thing that mattered was he seemed smart.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Well, cocaine gives...

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Oh, I really like drugs as well.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
No, I don't take them.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I'm interested in the effects they have in the addiction

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000
and the social perception of addicts.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Now, this is a conversation for the stream,

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
but I will touch on it now.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
So, you know when someone says,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
oh, that person's so addicted

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000
that they couldn't give up the drugs for their kids

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000
and then they're like, oh, that's disgusting, XYZ.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
No, motherfucker.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.000
That shows you how unbelievably,

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:41.000
like, the grip that the narcotics has on that person,

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
it shows you they have...

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
They are unable to reason.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000
It shows you how strong and dependent their body is

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
on this substance, motherfucker.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Listen up!

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
That's not how it works.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Literally, people be like, oh, she couldn't beat...

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Like, you know, when you hear stories like, oh, he couldn't beat the addiction.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
She couldn't beat the addiction for, like, his son, her son or whatever.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Oh, they're weaker-weaver.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
No!

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:12.000
That shows how un-the-vice-like grip

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000
that does not even give them an inch to breathe

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
that the narcotics has on them.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000
But anyway, I'm gonna get into that conversation

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
in my special interests.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
So yeah, you're getting galaxy brain

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
because you're getting educated in my special interests.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
What if we're addicted to you?

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Um, hopefully I'm not detrimental to your health.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I hope anyway.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
But look, it's me!

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Hey, listen!

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Listen to my special interests.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
You will get to hear them all.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Where are you going?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000
You're wiggling away like a little worm.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Mmm.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
But yes, I also talk about how to reverse, like, the effects of addiction

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
and how it should actually work and, like, how you do it.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Good night, mommy.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Gonna ink and go to sleep.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
I love your honesty, Reefling.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Have an amazing inking session.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Please remember to say my name when you ink, okay?

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Just a little stronger.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Okay, that'll do me.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Thank you.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Thank you. Good night.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Okay.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.000
How many...

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Wait, have I spelled it wrong?

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Get educated in my special interests.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Oh.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Oops.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Should I leave it in?

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Should I leave it in?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Because it makes it more like me?

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Me.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Okay.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Next thumbnail.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Right.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
So then after you've been educated in my special interests, Reefling,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
next, we are...

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I actually don't know what we're playing.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Hold on.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Let me pull up my whole thing.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
We're playing supermarket simulator.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
That might get exchanged if I am dumb.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
And it's apparently a long game, which I had no idea about.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Oopsies.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000
That was a mistake.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Genuine mistake.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
It was a mistake.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
It was a mis-input.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Mis-input.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Puzzle.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Secret puzzle.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Secret puzzle.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Revealing my thumbnail.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Secret, secret, secret, secret puzzle.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Wait.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Where are you doing a collab with Azura?

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I am.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:23.000
But you're not seeing the thumbnail yet.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
It's a secret.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:28.000
So this is my supermarket thumbnail.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
No, you guys honing in on the text.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
You guys are so smart.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
They're like going straight for the text first.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
That's so wise.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
This is a really cool way to post your schedule.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Yeah.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000
I think I'll do a puzzle stream again maybe once I've got more behind the scenes art

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000
work and stuff to show off because I think it's quite exciting doing it that way.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
So I'll need to get ordering.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Chop, chop, scrawny.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Get ordering some more things.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
So I gave my lecture to date.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Despite my lack of preparation, I spoke well and I ascribed to the cocaine I had taken

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
before and I told.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.000
So cocaine is really interesting because it gives you an ego.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:13.000
I know that sounds crazy because you know, you know people that are unconfident, you

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
know, we've all experienced something like that.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
A mis-input.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
I'm going to, I'm going to put something in this mess.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
All right.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Okay.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
That's actually really good.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000
You get, you have been awarded the comment of the day.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Congrats.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
That was actually a really good comment.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
I know I sound so sarcastic.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
It's so funny that I can't laugh.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
It's that good.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Okay.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.000
What was I saying?

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Oh cocaine.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.000
It gives you an ego.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So when you're unconfident, often you will hear things such as, oh, you know, fake it

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
until you make it.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Say positive affirmations to yourself.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
The substance cocaine gives you an ego.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
It is the most bizarre side effect.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Truly.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Sam, thank you for the rose.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Why is your profile picture a pan?

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Wait, that's not even a pan.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.000
That's a walk.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Why is your profile picture a walk?

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:06.000
That's so specific.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Thank you, Sam, for the rose.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
You're giving me flowers.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:14.000
I appreciate.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Are we super chats?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I won't call it super chat.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.000
There we go.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
The booger sugar, honestly.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Freud was kind of cute, but it was a bit too much.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.000
It was a bit much.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:24.000
He did.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I think he did a really messed up experiment with someone's kids at one point.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
And I was like, oh, Freud, steady on.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
It's a skillet.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Isn't that a walk?

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Oh, sorry.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:47.000
He did.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
And a lot of times the thing's not really scientific.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of things with Freud.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
I'll do a deep dive.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I might also talk about Guy Fox because on the 5th of November, a guy called Guy Fox.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Yeah, his name was literally Guy.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:11.000
He planned to blow up parliament on the 5th of November, but his plot got foiled.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:19.000
So on the 5th of November, the UK set of fireworks for it.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But England celebrate it because his plot got foiled, but Scotland celebrate it because they...

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Yeah, you know what I'm trying to say, right?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
So fireworks on the 5th of November in Scotland.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Yeah, we were rooting for him.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000
He had the right idea.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
It's a memorial day in Scotland that day for funny reasons.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
For me, it ends up being microbiology and diseases.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Ooh, I could talk about diagnoses.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
I quite like them too.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:06.000
The only problem when you talk about diagnoses, especially when it's genetic disorders or whatever,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I don't want to use actual pictures of people because that's not very nice.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Maybe I can get medical drawings to be respectful to the identity.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I can at least forget Freud because he was the one of the early researchers in the field that was prey.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
This is my supermarket simulator.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
I say, bag your own shite.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000
So, I'm going to tell you one thing I don't like about you Aussies.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Ooh, that's right, Australians.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I'm calling you out at 6am in the morning.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.000
No, the Australian etiquette is you do not bag your own items.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
In Scotland, you bag your...

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Put scrawny in the bag.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000
In Scotland, you bag your own items.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.000
When I came to Australia and saw that people do not bag their own items,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I was mortified.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
I watched the most impatient woman ever get her stuff bagged.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
And I'm like...

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
And she was like, can you hurry up?

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I'm on a time crunch.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000
And I'm like, just if you...

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:19.000
If you bagged it yourself, you would already be in your car driving away to your house.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Okay?

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Are you squinting me right now?

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Reflin for a month.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Thank you, little kawakami for the extended membership.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I appreciate it.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
You're doing it.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Right, what comes after?

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Keep forgetting my schedule.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
As if I'm not the one who freaking made it.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
And...

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I'm doing ring fit.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Right, ring fit next.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Okay, this is a bit of a...

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:48.000
It's rather familiar, so don't be too surprised if you recognize it.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
It's not much of a different layout, okay?

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I confess.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
I must confess.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I still believe.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Still believe.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Right, one more, one more, one more.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Oh.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Oh, okay, that was a little bit...

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000
One more.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Thank you for the extended membership again.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Ritto!

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I probably said your name horrifically wrong.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Bro, that was one thing about that collab stream with the girls.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I was saying everyone's name wrong.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Like horrifically wrong.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Bags are cashier exclusive where I live.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
The bag, the stuff, I'll scan it.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Yeah.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.000
It's a different everywhere, but I bag my own stuff.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Thank you, ladrian.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
You sound like an elf from Lord of the Rings.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Ladrian.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Thank you for becoming a member.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I appreciate it.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Yeah, I bring a backpack, so I pack my own stuff.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:51.000
And whenever I say to the person that's attending me,

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I'm always like, oh, good morning.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
I'm just going to pack it myself.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
They're always like, oh, thank you so much, dear.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
And I'm like, ooh.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000
And then I always explain, yeah, in Scotland you do it yourself.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Now, you can't ask for help in Scotland.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Don't get me wrong.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
But if you want to be in and out of that shop,

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
as quick as can be, then I want more of the collab stream.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
It was so funny and cute.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Well, let's review another girl.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I think we're probably going to do a tier list,

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
like an actual tier list at some point.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Now, and before fucking VTubers get their feelings hurt

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
because we're actually ranking them,

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I'll do a meme-y to you, a bit of a meme side, OK?

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
And it would be like, would slap in between your thighs,

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
would lick them or something like that,

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:42.000
would put like chocolate cake on them or something.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I just want all the girls together.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Aw, you like when we hang out together?

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000
I find it so fun.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I already know what the collab is in August,

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
but I'm not going to tell you because it's inside your secrets.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000
You're not allowed to know what the collab is in August.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Howdy.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Hi, Evelyn.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
We're currently doing puzzles

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
and I'm making you unlock my thumbnails for the week via puzzles.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I love Stony Cuddles.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I love, I love Evelyn Cuddles.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Alright, keep your secrets, honestly.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Alright, then keep your secrets.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Was actually my night elf, George's name and wow.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Ah, and I told you it was Elvin.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
And the USA.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I don't know.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Brian.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
In the USA, if you want to bag your own stuff,

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
you just use self-checkout machine.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Same if you have social anxiety.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Ah, that's cool.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I like that sound.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Are you squinting me right now?

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Uh,

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Maurizio.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Did you forget to send a message?

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
You could have typed in that super chat.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Thank you for giving me your super chat, Cherry.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Right now.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
How did I say that?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Maurizio Rosetti.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Okay, I can say that part good.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Thank you for the super chat.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I appreciate it.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
And Sam too.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
You know, there's self-checkout,

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
and if you want to do your own thing,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
you can use self-checkout,

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
but it depends how much I've got,

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
but I put everything in my backpack,

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
because I rate a bake.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.000
What are you doing?

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Alright, this is the first time I think USA

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
have a good thing going,

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
sweaty mummy.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
I hope you're ready for it,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000
because I'm going to be a load of anything.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
I'm digging the background music.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:35.000
It is a Lo-Fi Elden Ring?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
No.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Legend of Zelda non-copyright.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Ta-da!

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Ring Fito Avento de...

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Where did it go?

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Where did it go?

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I didn't find myself.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
But that's it.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
And look at my heart rate.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
It's 1,380.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Oh no, it's 138 beats per minute.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I'm at the last.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000
I was like, how, 1,388?

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
No, 138.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I have no idea what my heart rate max

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
is going to be on the stream,

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.000
but we'll find out together.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.000
Mummy in those thighs makes me want to ink.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Steady on.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Copyright Lo-Fi Zelda beats to make puzzles.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
No, not copyright.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Non-copyright.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Non-copyright.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Non-copyright.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
No copyright, okay?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Please don't perish from the heart rate.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
No, I will look after myself.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Gamer chop.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
My resting heart rate is like 90 and 100.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Damn, are you me?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000
But yeah.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Mummy looks cute in that outfit.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000
You like it?

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
You like my little headband?

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
I need to stick on her.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I like the way you do.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I'm like, there, there.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
There's thighs though.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Okay, how many more thumbnails do we got?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Will it do a fit?

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Right.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.000
I will challenge you to 150 to see how unbelievably easy it is.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Eh, who is next?

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Sakura game.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Okay.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Oh, this is ridiculous.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
This is going to take like no time at all.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.000
As long as you guys are having fun though, that's all that matters.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Right.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I need to lake.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I don't even think I'm going to have time to pin this.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Are you ready?

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Okay, boom.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
I don't even think I have time to pin it before you guys finish it.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
There we go.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Replace pin.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Yeah, this is what 50 pieces is.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:23.000
This is Suika and not Tsukiyo.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:31.000
No, this is too quick.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I am Watamera.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Mummy's Melons.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Would you play with Mummy's Melons?

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
There you say.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000
You did it.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Replay.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Oh, almost.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:48.000
Oh, we're getting edged.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000
We're getting edged with an edge piece.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Coco Melon.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
No.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
There you go.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Tsukiyo.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
One big stretch.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Tsukiyo.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Wow.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Okay.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
I switched.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
I'm jumping up and down.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Boing.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I'm up on the top corner.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I'm down on the top corner.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I'm up again.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I'm down.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I'm hovering over gently in the middle.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Oh, I'm in the other corner.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
What am I going to do?

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Oh.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Oh.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Oh, I'm jumping in them.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I am diagonal out here.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Call me Diagon because I'm Diagon Alley Moving.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
That's absolutely awful.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
You won the last one to be a thousand pieces.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
I don't even think something else is that good.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000
If you want it to be a thousand pieces, sure.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I'll do as you command my refling.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Your wish is my command, truly.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Okay.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Next we have Azura collab.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Okay.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Thumbnail.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
A thousand pieces and random rotation.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Are you mad?

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Okay.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
How about next time?

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
No.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Maybe we wouldn't do it this time.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
How about next time we do...

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
What does that say?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Azura.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Azura.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Azura.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Azura.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:11.000
The servers are like pleased for the love of God.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Oh, Azura.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000
What the heck?

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Oh, we're doing a call.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I'm making the reflings see the thumbnails via puzzles on stream.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
I'm putting them to work.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Hi, Azura.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Azura, you have not slept.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I have not slept, so I know for a fact you have not slept.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Bad gateway.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Is this the wrong link?

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I was secretly doing the two other puzzles, were you?

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Azura, you have not slept at all.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
You did such a long stream.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I don't even know when you went to bed.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000
I went to bed and I think you still kept going.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:52.000
It worked, but we overloaded it for a second.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I love refling cuddles.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000
16 hours of league.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000
You broke the vod and then some.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Jesus.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
I took a three hour nap.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:06.000
You are going to be perishing during the Yumi Plus concert.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
You know that, right?

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.000
You're going to be a piddle, a little piddle on the floor.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
You're not going to make it.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
This is me and Azura's thumbnail.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Azura and I, sorry.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
It's not me and person.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Person and I is the proper English.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Sorry, I know it bothers some people.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I apologize.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I was raised in a barn, okay?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I don't know your customs and your ways.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Can I drink her?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Well, if she melted into a puddle.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
I mean, if you want.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
The pot's kind of calling the kettle black, here's the lures.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
No!

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
I don't get sleep because...

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Well, yeah.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Okay.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
You know what?

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Sometimes you're right, Riflin.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Sometimes you're maybe on to something.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
I want scrawny curls to R word me so I can cry in the shower afterwards.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Hang on.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I don't think you can say that.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Before anyone says where did I spawn that from?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
It's in the chat.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
It's right there.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Before anyone says where did that spawn from?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Hang on.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
You can say that, I lied.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Real?

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
No, you're not supposed to agree.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Why?

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000
No.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Why would you cry?

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.000
He did, so it must be legal.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Twilight Princess music?

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Yeah, you have good ears.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
That Riflin speaks the truth.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Cry?

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Cry because it's over?

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
So, baby?

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
When it comes to using me or I,

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
you just have to remove the other person from the sentence

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000
and whichever one sounds natural is correct.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000
I don't know.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
What?

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Tiny Spiny?

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
What?

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Thank you for the tip.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Are you sure?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000
No, because it's like Azura and I are playing...

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
We were here.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I...

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Hmm.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000
What?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
We only cry because we stopped.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
You think the devs read this at any point?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.000
They're currently looking up what Strony Cuddles is

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.000
and they're being introduced to the world of V-Tubing.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Love my cuddlefish wife.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Aww, such a cute nickname.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I just want Strony Cuddles hugs her peak.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Yeah, so this is the thumbnail.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I've colour-coordinated it.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.000
It looks green, orange, like my hair,

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
and then blue and purple.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Someone said Azura's hair is green,

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000
but it's like a teal blue, is it not?

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
That Strony lover?

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Me, for real, for real.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Why are you booing him?

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
He's right.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
They probably have a bunch of resource usage

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
and they'll check later and wonder.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
It's Meku colour.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
So it's blue, right?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
It looks cyan to me.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Is cyan blue?

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
It's definitely not teal.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Well, people were saying her hair was green

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000
and I'm like, no, my hair is green.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Closer to green than blue?

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
I don't...

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
I see blue.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I see blue.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
I see blue.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
I see blue.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
That was my old account, by the way.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.000
All of that, me, for real.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Oh, shit.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
I think we're timing it.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I think I broke the servers.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I think I broke the servers.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Hold on.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Wait, no.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Is it still...

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Am I going crazy?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I thought this one.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
It's like a sea foam green.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Sea foam blue?

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Yeah, I thought it was blue.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I don't know.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Maybe it's my eyes.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
But like, if you look at me, you can be like,

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
yeah, Strony's got green in her hair.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
But if you look at Azura, it's like,

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.000
she's a kind of a blue-purple palette.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000
I want the Vealer Girls...

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
The R word, me.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Reflames!

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
You want us to run a train on you?

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
One by one.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Or we'll just take a plop at a time.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
That's terrible.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.000
I shouldn't encourage it.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.000
I'm encouraging it.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
I shouldn't.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
I shouldn't.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
It looks close to Aquamarine.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Aquamines blue water.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
So, surely.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Surely.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Okay, and then after we've done Azura's stream,

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000
we have Drumroll, please.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Mario Kart, which I am going to add you guys into it

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
because it's not got you in it,

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
which I don't like.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
I want you in it.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Nope.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.000
That didn't work.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.000
That did work, however.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Puddle!

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
This is the second-last one,

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
and then I'm going off and redirecting.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
I'm slightly blue-colorblind,

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
so I don't know, a fuck room.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
We're as bad as each other right now, god damn!

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Now, this is Mario Kart.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Are you squidding me right now?

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Broly legend.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
So, Strongly does the carpet match the drapes.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
No, there's no carpet.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Oh, here.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Oh, wait, no.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000
It's carpet in my head.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:15.000
No.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Yeah.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Wait, I get so confused.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
This is an American term.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000
What does it mean again?

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Carpet is below because curtains are above.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Right.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
No, it doesn't.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I don't have anything.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Carpet's other one.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Sorry.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
It's like an American sentence,

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.000
and I'd never hear it until I entered the internet.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Shocking, baby.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Are you posting it again, Anon in the chat?

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I can see it right above me.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Orange Anon will call you because your text name is orange.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Love, Strongly cuttles, do I?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I do.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Love me, cuttles.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Love me, cuttlefish.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Love me.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Love me, Momay.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Love me, Dominatrix.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Love me, Yandere.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.000
Love me, little sister.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
And love me.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000
What was it?

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Mezugaki.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Kuzugaki.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
My Bratipolar mirror.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000
My Bratiprincess.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Is she your princess?

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Is that that?

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I see princess now.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Instead of Brat.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Thank you for the tip, frilly legend.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Well, speaking of wax,

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000
you'll never guess what one of my Donathon rewards are.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Wahoo!

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Himagaki.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:47.000
No, kuzugaki means like shit-talking brat.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
No way.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Yeah.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
I was going to go to a parlor.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:58.000
That would wax me and give me permission to record the audio.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I'm obviously going to tip the girl because not only does she have to look at my clam,

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:13.000
if you didn't know, when you get a Brazilian wax, you also have to present your derriere as well.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:16.000
They do your derriere.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
So I think I have to literally bend over on this table.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
I don't know what's going to happen,

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.000
but I'm going to ask permission to record it for a Donathon reward if we reach it.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
So that would be a very interesting audio to put out there.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Once again, I misunderstood when you said record.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
It's going to be great.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I'd literally be like, wah!

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
I have no idea what it's going to be like.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Apparently it's super painful though, like the first time.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
No, I'm not going to bring the 3D.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Oh, I'm going to freak her out with that thing.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:54.000
The audio, not the visuals.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:57.000
The audio.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Good thing I can do this puzzle one-handed.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Stop! No!

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
How can it not be painful?

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Well, they say if you do it over time, it's not as painful like it isn't sore as sore.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
The audio is more than enough.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Stop! That's terrible.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:27.000
They say the more you do it, the easier it is for the hairs to be pulled out from the root,

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
because that's what you're doing when you wax.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
You're pulling it from the root.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.000
But the first time you do it will always be the most painful.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.000
So I'm rather nervous, I'm going to be honest,

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:45.000
but I was going to get like a full wax like my legs, my armpits,

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.000
and then my clam and all that.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
So I don't know how long the audio is going to be,

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
but I think it's literally going to be me going like...

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.000
So over time, you get an iron clam.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:06.000
No! You're upgrading my clam.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Also, can you post pictures afterwards?

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:15.000
What? You want to see my hairy armpit before and then after?

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I don't think that's very cheeky.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I maybe do a cheeky armpit picture, I don't know.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I'd be kind of down for that.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:32.000
I was going to do a foot photo shoot where I do every interest for imaginable,

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:39.000
like wrinkly foot, oiled up, dirt outside, spread toes.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Like I was going to do a mega collage of everything and anything you could have wanted.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Like of, I don't know, more about the taco and the peach for me.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
No! I'm putting them in a picture of a peach.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Well the more you do it the rarer it gets.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Imagine an adamantium clam.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:00.000
It's so op.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
It's a bit, don't ask them that.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
They're going to say yeah.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
My poor reflex.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Can that be considered a tazadivel?

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Waxing speaks to me because it ingrown hairs.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Post pics of the wax strips.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I feel it.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Oh, I'm not sure about that one, Chief.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I mean, if you want to, I guess it's natural but I'm not sure about it.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
The clam will be strong and tight enough to snap tentacles.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Oh, just inked his pants somewhere.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Praise be to Talos.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
You'd be surprised how many, like the pheromone pet.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Let me go snap.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Right, I'm going to edit this so that's you and that's you and that's you.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Okay, deal.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.000
So this one's you and this one's you and this one's you.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
And then my accord with you.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Cute face.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Yeah, you're like my...

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:07.000
I can't get around the bend because I still don't know how to drift in that game.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I'm probably going to have to look up a tutorial unironically on how to do that game.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Can you also run me over?

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Why would I run you over?

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:18.000
I'll run a train on you but I will not run over with you in an automobile.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
All those racers, me.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Literally me.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.000
That'll be me.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Blue shell coming at you.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:29.000
No!

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
You want me to edit a blue shell?

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Reflink coming at me?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
That would actually be really funny.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Hold on.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Hold on, you're giving me oil up.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Who said oil up?

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
I've just caught that.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I want her to outward me.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:47.000
No, don't use the interactive chat in a puzzle game to state your claims.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Okay, last thumbnail if I'm not mistaken.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
It's not the most exciting.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:56.000
I don't know what this game contains but you guys were like,

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Oh, it's a sad game.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Okay, so you'll never guess what I did with the thumbnail.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:11.000
At last but not least, please can I buy the wax strip?

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Funny you mentioned that because I could have sworn I saw a tech talk about a girl that

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:18.000
made a hundred dollars because she used to sell her wax strips.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
I don't think you're joking.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I don't think that Reflink's joking.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
I'm getting nervous, okay?

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I'm getting shaky.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
The intimidation music shift.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Oh no, sorry, I'm not showing the screen.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Whoopsies.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Next thing you know, people are asking about Johnny's bathwater.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I wish I could do that but I feel like I'm like so nasty.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
I want her to outward me.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
No, don't use the alternative chat as well.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
You both can't be started on both sides.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
That's terrible, Reflink.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
So I have to enter a puzzle chat to save by all things.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:57.000
No!

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:01.000
This is terrible.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Alright, we're going to meet them while you're at it.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Alright, enough, enough, enough, we're getting too far.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
I'm going to get this going to be limited ads.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
I'm going to end up being demonetised.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Johnny being nasty and more like tasty.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I love this woman.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Love you, Terry Reflink.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Hi!

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Join the queue for...

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Okay, you're done.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Cutie.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Now you're in cutie.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
What I need to do for mom...

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
No!

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
No, no more.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Filling the database with all these comments.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Honestly, they're going to be like one error that's going on.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Gennlain.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Johnny could probably make bank sale and use...

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Used what?

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Absolutely not.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Use pads.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Are you serious?

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Are you guys vampires or something?

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Absolutely not.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Reflink's kind of freaky.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Chat restraints.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Reflects the streamer through and through.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
That's terrible.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Fine, no R wording.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Just go to town, though.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I'm going to hug this woman until she falls asleep and go flying.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Funny you mentioned vampires.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Is that going to be a teabag?

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Is that going to be a teabag?

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
What?

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Funny you mentioned vampire.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Is that going to be a teabag?

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:25.000
The pad is going to be a teabag for a vampire?

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Ewww!

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Stop!

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Right, you've won the gross comment of the day, Reflink.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Congrats.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Don't...

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Queeflings?

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000
No.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
No.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Absolutely not.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
You guys are not referring to yourselves as fucking queeflings.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Do I make myself abundantly clear?

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Listen to the tone of my voice.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:55.000
You are not referring to yourselves as queeflings.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Absolutely not.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Absolutely not.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Why not?

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Why not?

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:09.000
It is so cursed.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Don't worry, mummy.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
We will always be your queeflings.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
We love you.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000
I'm a queefling now.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Azura, don't encourage them!

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Azura, no!

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Azura, you're going to encourage them!

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000
How many subs for a queefling meme ASMR?

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.000
I don't know how to queef.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
I don't know how to do it.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Mods, panasura, mods, timasura.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Kidding.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Mummy being staring gets us going.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Call ourselves worst things?

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
No.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Queeflings...

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000
No!

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Right, I'm not reading that word.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000
If I see that word, I'm not reading it.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Do you understand?

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Start practicing.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I don't have a word.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Yeah.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Name of...

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Oh, that game.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Yeah, it's a tearjerker.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Absolutely not.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Oh, I'm jerking all right.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Sort of way.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I don't know what's in it.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
You guys just told me it was really sad.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
So I was like, okay.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Mods, panasura, Azura.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
She has the wrench.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Only you and your admins can.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Oh.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000
She's immune.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Oh, you guys are fucking...

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Oh, that...

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Azura created the mods.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.000
You can't ban her.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
I'll literally...

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Azura is your mummy.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
How are you going to stop us?

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Going to pin us down and force it out of us?

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Okay, we're back to our word.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000
And that's more like it.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
That's more like it.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.000
If Strani became a muscle mummy, would we switch to beeflings?

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:30.000
That's actually kind of humorous.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
I'll give you that one.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Strani after running a train on the reeflings.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.000
She's a queer...

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
We're queeflings now.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Shut the fuck up.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Sorry.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Beeflings?

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Wait, what else is going to mean?

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Meaf...

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Meaflings?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Beeflings?

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.000
When the reeflings are thrown pests on each other,

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
they become beeflings.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Because it's beeflinging.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Oh my god, what other words?

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Eaflings?

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Weeflings?

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000
See, I'm looking at my keyboard to go through the alphabet.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Eaflings?

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:17.000
C-flings?

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.000
C-flings?

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.000
C-fling you across...

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
I see you and I fling you across the room.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
D-flings?

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Beeflings?

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
G-flings?

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000
G-flings?

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:32.000
He-flings?

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:34.000
G-flings?

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:36.000
G-flings?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:38.000
Sneeflings?

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.000
When the reeflings are sick,

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:40.000
I talk them in the bed

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
because they're my little sneeflings.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Oh, that's so cute.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.000
With mummy numbs my ears,

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
I become a tingling.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Wait, isn't a tingling the things in Legend of Zelda?

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Aren't they called tinglings?

02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.000
If we get too cheesy,

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
are we called brieflings?

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Oh my god, that's so good.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Fun reeflings go wee flings.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Sorry, that one was bad.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
They hold short, they hold swords.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
We call them sheathlings.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
When reeflings are upset,

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
they're grieflings.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
I'm loving this, sorry.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
When the reeflings are gassy,

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
we become que-

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:22.000
No!

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.000
No!

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
No, not that one.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Everyone else, everything good.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Not that one.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
GG.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Your tight climb syndrome

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:30.000
made me queefing.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Yeah, I've never,

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I don't know how to do it.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
So, I'll look up a tutorial.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I'll look up a tutorial

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
and I'll do it.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Oh my god.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Oh my god.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
That was so good to end on.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Holy crap.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
That's all my thumbnails for the week.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I hope you enjoyed that.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000
That was hilarious.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Oh.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.000
That was so good.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Alright.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000
When mommy post audios,

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
we become stifflings.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Oh no, I have to edit the audios too.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
I need to edit one of my audios

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
and one of Azuras today.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
I forgot about that.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Right.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
First, nap.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Second,

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Umi plus.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Third,

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
maybe nap again

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
depending on how tired I am.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
No, I got signed out on my YouTube.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Are you serious?

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Oh, for god's sake.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Hold on.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:33.000
I don't know why.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I seem to get signed out on my YouTube so much.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Hold on.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Hold on.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I need to look into the old.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I need to look into it.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
No way.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Why does it keep signing me out?

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
I'm not doing anything against the law here.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Oh my god.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
I don't think I can redirect.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
I think I'm going to have to go on my other PC

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000
because I have two PCs.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000
That's right, baby.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
And redirect via the other PC

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
then come back here and wrap up stream.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Does that make sense?

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Or should I wrap up now and disappear?

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000
No.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Because I need to be on in order to do the redirect.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Man, this is fun.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
I don't know why I get signed out on YouTube so much.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.000
I don't know.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
It's bizarre.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
We are reeflings in strontiae.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Our words are...

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:27.000
No, no, no.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
That's not why I called you reeflings.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:33.000
I called you them because of the halflings

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000
from Lord of the Rings.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.000
You're not called reeflings

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
because I are a word you on a daily basis.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
When in doubt, just assume YouTube hates me.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Yeah, honestly.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Oh my god.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
I don't even think I have my outro asset.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I'm not even kidding.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I do have an ending screen.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Do I dare to use it?

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
I actually have an ending screen.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:33:59.000
I think we're going to use it

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:00.000
for the first time ever.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Wait, so we're all our word halflings?

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
No, that's not why I called you.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Well, okay, ending screen it is then.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
I've literally not used it.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
I think I used it once for debut and never again.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
A once in a lifetime event, I dare you.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Okay.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Thank you so so much

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
for having such a carry on with me.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
I hope you enjoyed the artwork reveals

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.000
and the fun things that I did have behind the scenes

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000
as well as my thumbnails and my schedule.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
I thought that was really fun.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Please don't be.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
I might do that again in the future

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
because it was like no download, no hassle,

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
no fuss, no nothing.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Thank you for puzzling with the puzzles all over you.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
My puzzle league flings, I tried.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:47.000
I'm sorry.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I love Winston.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:50.000
I love you.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Love you.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Thank you for enjoying stream.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
I might do that again.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
If I get more behind the scenes stuff

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
that I can kind of leak via a puzzle

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
because I find that absolutely hilarious.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I don't know why.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
It's tickling my pickle in a very good way.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Okay.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000
That was so fun.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Thank you for hanging out.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Next week's stream snipe game is Mario Kart.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:13.000
I am going to be going live again today.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
To watch the Yumi Plus concert.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I'm just going to make sure.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I'm just going to make sure what time it's at.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Okay.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.000
It's at 10 a.m.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
So if I go to bed right now,

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I can get a cheeky two hour sleep.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Can I tickle your pickle and push the naughty over?

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000
No.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Two weeks.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Give me two weeks.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
And then all the thought already begins again.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000
You give me two weeks and I'll start cooking all over again.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
But yes, that was so fun.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Thank you for hanging.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Thank you for lurking.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Thank you for doing puzzles.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Again, Azura came in and did puzzles at one point as well.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:56.000
I'm going to use my ending screen.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:57.000
I cannot believe it.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
And then I'm going to run and boot up my PC

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
and then actually redirect into someone.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Is she be live right now?

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
She better be.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000
She be cotton bum.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
You better be live right now.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
I'm going to spank you.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Is there no VR lure girl live?

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Oh no.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
This can't be.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Oh.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Well, if there's no VR lure girl live,

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I'll just...

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:32.000
I'll go live.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Are you going live?

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.000
What are you going to play?

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Don't say legal legends.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I've redirected into legal legends too many times Azura.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000
You're getting spanked for it.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:41.000
What are you going live with?

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000
You want that too?

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000
DEMPA's doing a...

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:47.000
I can't...

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Don't do it.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:50.000
She's going to play League again.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Azura, you were showing off your skins at one point

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.000
and you were telling us about your favourite character.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
I've forgotten their name.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
But they kind of looked like you.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.000
And I was like...

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Oh.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Because they had like big blue hair.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:06.000
DEMPA's live right now?

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:07.000
One, two inches.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000
One, two inches.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000
DEM...

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:10.000
I went to bed this morning.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Azura's still going.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
She is addicted.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Coming for my endurance title.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
How dare you Azura.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Are you actually going live?

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Or will I redirect into DEMPA?

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000
If it's DEMPA's birthday, I'll go redirect into DEMPA.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Azura's legalings?

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Honestly.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.000
No, no, I was joking.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.000
No live.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I was going to say,

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
you need rest before this little watch long.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Right, I'm going to go redirect into DEMPA

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000
because it's her doughnathon.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
You'll need to give me like two minutes to run

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
and put up my computer and get it set up.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Is this fucking...

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I have no idea.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I have...

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Oh, wait, hold on.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Hold on, we have a...

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
Oh, pause, pause.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
We might not need the ending screen at all.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
I repeat, ladies and gentlemen,

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
we might not need that ending screen at all.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
It will remain a mystery.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:03.000
You have even...

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
You have yet to see...

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
You have yet to actually see

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
my stingers as well.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
I was accessing my files yesterday

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:15.000
because I was having to send stuff to my editors,

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Arisa, and I was looking at the files

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000
and I saw my stinger and I'm like,

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
I have yet to show my actual stingers.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
I have credit on the website

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
for the people who made my stingers,

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
but the actual stingers...

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Are you trolling me?

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Did you say DEMPA is live?

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
When she...

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
No one is live!

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
Upcoming, upcoming.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
I don't see one live person

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:40.000
that I'm subscribed to.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I think they said DEMPA was live.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Is she live on Twitch?

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Did you think I could redirect on Twitch?

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Are you trolling me?

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Oh, she is live.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
What the fuck?

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Why did that not show up?

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:53.000
That's so dumb.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Sorry, it never showed up for some reason.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.000
You were telling the truth.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I'm so sorry.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Okay, do you actually want to see

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
the ending screen, to be honest?

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Okay, I'll show you the end.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:05.000
She is though.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Sorry, it wasn't displayed.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000
I don't know.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
There are a lot of things displayed at once.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
You think we're that dumb?

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Well, I'm dumb

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
and sometimes chat's the reflection

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
of this dreamer,

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
so what does that make two of us, huh?

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Okay, I'll show it.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Thank you so much for hanging out

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.000
with me, Reeflings.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Tomorrow, we will be drawing

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
your stinky gen 2 suggestions.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
So please keep that in the back of your mind.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.000
You're welcome to submit it via Marshmallow,

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
or you can do it live in the chat.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.000
But if you do Marshmallow,

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
I can probably mentally prepare a bit better

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.000
for what I'm going to draw.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.000
So don't be afraid to use Marshmallows.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Thank you so, so much.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
I'll see you good for givers tomorrow

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
and I'll put up all my wait rooms and all that.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:49.000
No, I'll see you in Yumi Plus Concert.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Give me two...

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Three hours.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Three hours, I'll see you in Yumi Plus Concert.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Okay, I'll be singing and stuff, okay?

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
And then we're going to take notes

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
and then I'm going to ask Yumi Plus and be like,

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:00.000
hey, how the fuck did you do that concert?

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Because I want to do it for my girls.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Okay, thank you so, so much.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
I'll see you later today, Reefling.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:08.000
But please enjoy Dampock

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
because it's her little birthday.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Even just lurking in the shadows is helpful, okay?

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Bye-bye!

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Time to use my end screens.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Oh, who goes there?

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:17.000
I need to...

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Alright, can you hear me?

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Okay, you can.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000
This is my actual streamer's ending scene.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Ta-da!

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000
I did it.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
I had to censor it because...

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Yeah, it's very...

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
It's very OP.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Now, let's meet and look at you on my head

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000
with your nicotine patch

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
and we both have hypnosis toggles

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:50.000
because you can technically hypnotise me too, Reefling.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Did you not know that about your lore?

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:55.000
That you're naughty and you hypnotise me sometime?

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Hmm?

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Yeah.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Yes, I have Butt Fangs and I have Booba

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
and I had to cover it.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Don't forget to like and subscribe

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:10.000
for the other industry.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.000
She's actually...

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000
It's true, it's real.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Okay, I'll test out the stingers

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
at another date, okay?

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Need to give us a hypno-ending streamer.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Yeah, you like it?

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Well, we're listening to...

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Lea Jean de Zelda, but yeah.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:29.000
We usually don't have to

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
since you prefer the backfire scenario.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Honestly, I love it.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Shove a mirror in my face.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
I'm going to be right back

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
writing a new marrow right now.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Okay.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I don't want to go yet.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
I'm really enjoying today's stream.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000
That was really fun.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I enjoyed that.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000
I don't know.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
I like when we do stuff together.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Does that make me a weirdo?

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.000
No.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000
It makes me in love with you.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Thank you.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:58.000
That was a really pleasant...

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
I know you can't see my model right now,

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
so I'm just trying.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
That was an incredibly fun stream.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
I thoroughly enjoyed that.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000
I really like when we can hang out like that.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
And I look forward to doing it more.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Yes, I'll get going.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
I'm going to go for a little chicken nap.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Maybe squeeze out a little chicken,

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
a little for bread while I'm at it.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
And then we can watch Yumi Plus together

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
and take notes.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Love you too, dismembered voice.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Literally, you can't even see my wee model.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Spends like a ridiculous amount of money on model.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Doesn't even use it and just chats on the end and screen.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
But yeah, it's a really good loop.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:36.000
The loading screens were made by YumiYumiWorks.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.000
They were fantastic.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:40.000
They were such a good sport about everything.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000
I was like, it is paramount that reeflings are with me.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
Because at first I was going to be the only one

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
that had their mascot in their loading screen.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:53.000
You're not giving me money because I used my...

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I will send you...

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
I will do the stingers tomorrow, okay?

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000
I will do them tomorrow.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000
I need to send them to this PC because they're on my other PC.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:06.000
I will show you what my stingers look like tomorrow.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Don't give me money for that though.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Thank you, Murizyo for the five.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Don't give me money for doing stuff that an average streamer does.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:22.000
What's that letter in the middle?

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:23.000
An O?

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Strong E?

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Stip, writ, awe, knit, net, eh?

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Unless I'm not understanding.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.000
It feels like I can still hear her voice.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Pepe hands.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
No, that was really fun.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.000
We'll try Mario Kart.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000
See what's going on.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
We'll know the world is truly ending when a stream starts

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
and she's using the starting.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
That's when you know, literally,

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.000
censor hate is always hypnotizing us.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Stranny.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
I wonder what's behind the veal or what.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000
My butt fangs.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
You're not really supposed to be showing butt fangs,

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000
but I have butt fangs.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
So does Mercy actually.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
She's broken as I hear her in my head.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Stranny.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Stranny.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Stranny.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Stranny.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Stranny.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Stranny Gonzalez.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Forget speedy Gonzalez.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Stranny Gonzalez.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:13.000
One minute fifty-six beat my record right now.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000
Hello.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Hello.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.000
I'm about to go.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Stream's ending.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
I'm just trying to shake.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Bansley give butt fangs, yes.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.000
I'm gonna see, maybe Nari might work on a nude model for me.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:29.000
I'm not sure.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
I haven't been drawn nude.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
But maybe Nari'll entertain me.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Entertain me.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Stay with me.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
La la la la la la la la…

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.000
feeling.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
And those are not the words at all,

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
I have no idea what the words are.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Um, actually funny you mention stay with me

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
that song by the way?

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000
That, I'm making a short about that song.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
The, I don't know how you did that,

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
but anyway.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
The thought of that making me unwhysed.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Yes.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.000
And we're probably at the karaoke where Dad goes away too.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.020
I think I'll do ASMR, bathtub is my first stream.

02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:11.760
And then I'll do membership karaoke

02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:14.360
just to really give my voice the wham bam

02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:16.040
so I have no voice at all.

02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:17.000
You have butt fangs?

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:17.840
What coincidence?

02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:20.120
I also have fangs and they should meet your butt.

02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:23.200
Congrats again on 10k, thank you.

02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:26.240
That video propelled us ahead.

02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:29.480
That person, that clip, did that highlight reel?

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:30.720
Like fucking threw us ahead.

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:31.880
I'm not listening, right?

02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:34.720
I'm going offline, I'm going offline.

02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:39.640
Thank you for the very kind and super chat

02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:42.120
if it's on YouTube or still a tip, okay?

02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:43.800
Thank you for your tip.

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:47.920
Maurizio, I'm absolutely butchering your name, Maurizio.

02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:50.120
Okay, I'm going to go for a nap.

02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:51.540
I will see you in three hours, okay?

02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:53.080
Too many is three hours, okay?

02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:53.920
Enjoy your nap.

02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:56.360
If you want to nap with me, you can nap with me.

02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:57.680
I'm not going to say no.

02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:02.800
Bye-bye, strongy, bye, reef flings.

02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:04.960
I read that, but I'm not saying that.

02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:06.640
He's distracted by something.

02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:08.120
Mods, get that man.

02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:11.080
Okay, good night, I, no, no, good night.

02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:13.280
Later, three hours, for goodness sake, woman.

02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:15.080
Three hours, enjoy denpa.

02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:16.200
Right, give me a big kiss.

02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:17.040
Mm.

02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:20.400
Three hours, see you in three hours.

02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:22.480
No, good night, stop it, you're confusing me.

02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:24.800
But I'm going to bed for a nap, but see you in three hours.

02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:26.120
Okay, bye.

02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:26.960
Bye-bye, bye.
