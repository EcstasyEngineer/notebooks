{"text": " Being a VTuber and having to do taxes can be very interesting. By definition, anything you have to purchase in order to run your business may be eligible for a tax write-off. Meaning that things such as a live 2D model, artworks, editors, advertisements, script writers, heck, even songwriters can give you a cheeky reduction in your overall tax bill. But wait, there's more. Your internet and your electricity bill, even the rent if you live somewhere where you have a separate room to work in. It's also the exact same experience for loot VTuber activities as well.
