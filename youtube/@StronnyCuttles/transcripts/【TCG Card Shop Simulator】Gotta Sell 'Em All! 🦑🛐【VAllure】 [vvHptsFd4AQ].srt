1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,440
What is that song? It must have been a part B O. Is it a part B O? That movie? Is it Isate? Isate? Isate? Whatever.

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:26,240
Isate. That's absolutely. I'm sorry Vod. My Vodry flings. My Voi flings? Vodlings. Oh Vodlings just

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
right you probably shouldn't hear anything about that audio.

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,040
Oh I hear myself. Good morning, good evening, good afternoon. I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh my god,

5
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:04,400
nine minutes late. Mummy fucking despise of us. What in the fuck? I'm not. I don't. I love you.

6
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm sorry for being late. I have a bit of an update about the V-Lore game.

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,360
Hello? Yeah. I have a bit of an update about the V-Lore game. I got sent the beta? No, it's not a beta.

8
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,400
I got sent the part where it's before it gets shipped and we want to put notes in.

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:31,360
That's what I got sent. I played it. It's got progression. All I'm going to say is goddamn.

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,920
It's got progression. So there is a gameplay mechanic and it worked. It pulled itself off.

11
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,240
I obviously cannot say too much. But yes, the V-Lore video game, the estimated date to,

12
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,000
the estimated date, the producer, Samadess, I don't know what you want to call him. Oh my god,

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,960
it's the male that's producing the video game, male mansion. Yes, I'm sorry you had to find out

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,720
this one. It's a guy who produced the game. I'm sorry I had to beat you. He said that the

15
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,720
ninth? He said it's possible for a launch on the sixth. I'm going to send over my thoughts on my

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:29,040
notes. I'm going to see how long it takes to implement what my thoughts are. I'm going to send it to

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,280
a few other team members. I've got four. No, I've got three other team members I'm going to send it

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,120
to. The fourth one, not right now, that are going to play it as well. They're going to have access

19
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,040
to it and they're going to tell me what their thoughts are. Male on game. No, you're the male

20
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:58,000
end game. You're the one doing that with all my daughters. So you're welcome. You're welcome

21
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:09,520
that I paid for you to cuck me with my own daughters. You're welcome. And I hope you do come well.

22
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,960
Did you do your own route first? No. I'm just my fellow Americans. I'm going to just say this,

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,200
my route isn't perfect, but everyone else's came out the way. It was

24
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,480
Nintendo. Okay, Nintendo. Got it. Intended. But this ain't a game for kids.

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,520
More like Yahoo. The daughter and mummy and the mummy. You mean domain expansion, malevolent

26
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,880
bank show. It's so, so good. I will be doing it over and over again. Yes, unfortunately,

27
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,240
it didn't come out the way. However, if there was to be a video game in the future.

28
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,320
What's that? Oh, you heard it. Wait, do you go back to the start of the

29
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:03,440
VOD to get the Vodlings treat? How did you do that? Crazy Jesse, thank you for the tip.

30
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,320
And okay, no, you have to discover the lore for yourself if you don't know what the Vodlings get

31
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,400
just to discover yourself. How long does the game take for one route? It is linear,

32
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,640
but you can make different choices along that linear path, but your start and end will always

33
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,960
be the same. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? So the start and end will always be, well,

34
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,320
granted you fucking win, the start and end will be the same. If you lose, you have to click retry

35
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,480
because you suck. And if you want the good suck, you're going to have to unsuck to get sucked.

36
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay, so yeah. So it doesn't matter what we do. So you can get extra voice lines,

37
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:57,920
but basically my recommendation going into playing the game is pick your Oshi first.

38
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:08,240
That pick your order of preference first because you will be rewarded instantly. Or if you're a

39
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:16,560
bit of a long gratification person, pick your not least favorite. That's not, maybe that's not

40
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,920
the phrasing we want to say around these parts for Veiler. Your least watched girl. Pick her first

41
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:32,160
and then build up to your Oshi desu Veiler and then you might be able to enjoy it. So yeah,

42
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,880
suck, unsuck to get sucked. All right, I'm picking it. Pick your order. No, I'm not doing the vocal

43
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:50,400
for him. So again, sorry I took so long. I'm gonna keep it above 50. I don't feel very good right

44
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,440
now. I feel very sick, but that's just because, you know,

45
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,720
we're playing a knockoff game called TCG Card Jump Simulator Prologue.

46
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,120
How is your voice after all though? It's very sore to do. The microphone completely

47
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,040
heights how messed up my voice is. It really does. So we're playing a game called,

48
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,840
we're playing a game called Card Shop Simulator Prologue. Okay, but this isn't the full game.

49
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,480
It comes out in November. Who goes there? Also, I absolutely love the latest ASMR video. Oh did you?

50
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:52,560
Oh no, the next one's not talking. The next one is just not talking. Wait, should I check out the

51
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,360
comments on YouTube? Hold on, I can check out the comments on YouTube. Oh no. Yeah, I feel like when

52
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:14,800
I do unscripted rambling ASMR, I kind of, I kind of, oh people are timestamping when they came in

53
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:25,120
the game on Overwatch. That's okay. I had so much fun in that Overwatch. Yes, right, the next one's

54
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:37,120
not talking, but I hope that, what's the word? Oh no, what's the word? What do I hope?

55
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,840
Well, I've lost it anyway. Anyone else got a train of thought? Oh, I got it. I came back.

56
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:55,120
I've got about five more-ish recorded ASMRs that I can put on YouTube for the milestones,

57
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,960
and then, I'm gonna,

58
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,840
This is a refling from the future. Stronny turns into an Overwatch streamer from here on out.

59
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,880
No, it don't. With weekly Overwatch endurance streams. We're reaching GM with Mama.

60
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,000
I suck at Overwatch. Are you true?

61
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Oh, you think- Oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh. Hold on, I'm gonna go back to all these.

62
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,160
The game is available on a website that I personally like to dub. It's free to play.

63
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,960
Free to play one-handed.

64
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,760
But it is free to play unironically. I ate the cost, you're welcome.

65
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,920
I ate the cost, I also fucked it up so that's why no one could be mad when they play it and

66
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,200
they'll be like, oh this game is shit, fuck you. I ate the cost. Right, Future Reefblade.

67
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,880
No, I'm not going to be an Overwatch streamer. Yes, I'll play Overwatch with you again at

68
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,000
a later date, however, because I actually really enjoyed that. I got really lightheaded though.

69
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,680
But yes, right, Future Reefblade. No, I'm not Grandmaster, I suck at the game.

70
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,160
Grimmed by Vealor, I can't believe I have to say that out loud, thank you.

71
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,960
Why do I feel like Vealor, some of Vealor, we're harder to rid than others.

72
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:39,200
You think I put my money into a boring, a boring resident sleeper VN click thing?

73
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,080
No, there's gameplay. Okay, my fellow Americans. There's gameplay, that's why it cost a pretty

74
00:09:46,080 --> 00:10:00,400
penny because there's gameplay. So boring, snoozefest, resident sleeper. No, we play video games in

75
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,120
this house. You have to air in those cutscenes. Okay, I like VNs though. Oh.

76
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
You want a wholesome VN from us? I might be able to do that

77
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:26,000
because I have a contact for a wholesome Vealor VN if you want it. I can make it happen.

78
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,440
The game will be harder than Elzin Ring. No, there's a few balancing issues, but

79
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,200
I can't believe I'm, yes, there's balancing needed in the game. I'm not kidding.

80
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,480
But it's one of those games where you get a quite, quite fast gratification for progressing

81
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,520
because it's like, unlock, you unlock this, you unlock that, you unlock this.

82
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,480
And then things get, because then it gets easy. That's what I like in my video games. I like when

83
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,640
it's hard at the start and then you start unlocking stuff and then you start being able to

84
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,920
and because it's a shorter game, you're going to get that hit of serotonin all through it.

85
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
I mean, you're probably going to get hit of serotonin every cutscene as well if you've got a

86
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:20,560
few in the tank. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, M&S 188. Do you know if the game will be available?

87
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, it's you. It's not going on Steam, however, it's not going on Steam.

88
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,680
Anonymous? Oh, unless Brian and Dr.

89
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,280
Never said it would be boring. I just think someone would be more of a challenge than others.

90
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,160
I'm teasing. But I like a challenge actually.

91
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,600
A challenge? I'd say if you want a challenge, pick your Oshi first because it's just you and her.

92
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:52,480
What could I be hinting to? I feel like you guys already know.

93
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,680
I feel like you already know what the base game's about or what it was based on. I don't think it's

94
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,040
a thing. Anonymous, my mummy's money and blessings, I will gladly sacrifice to my record and plop every

95
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,440
girl equally in the game. Yes, you. So before anyone's like, I am exclusive to one girl at VLR,

96
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,120
well, you're going to be shutting the game down after one segment, if you will, because

97
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,920
yeah, pick your Oshi and then you get one segment. Congrats, like fucking. It's not like the others

98
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:29,440
didn't put effort into Jesus Christ. But obviously because it was the first time I've ever kind of

99
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,400
put a game together of that scale, I fucked up. I've told the girls I fucked up and I said to them,

100
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,280
look, there might be more options down the lane. Like if you guys want a wholesome VN,

101
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,280
that's actually rather plausible. That will be available on Steam. Now, unfortunately,

102
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,680
that would have to cost money. I wouldn't make it cost much because I'd make a deal with the

103
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,600
developer because I have a developer that I know for that. Just wait till mumma trolls the

104
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:05,520
reeflings. There is no corn, no riz, no gratification, just brain rot. Just wait till mummy trolls the

105
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:12,640
reeflings. Wait, when would I troll you? In game? I was actually... Oh no, I can't say that yet

106
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,480
because it's a treat for years. Oh, there's a treat coming up and I was going to ask my

107
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,360
treaty McBeaty if they wanted to...

108
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,720
Oh right, okay, no, that's a treat that comes later.

109
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,920
I think I got six hours again, which was really good. I didn't get my post-stream nap. I couldn't

110
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,040
nap. I was raging. I was like, excuse me, I genuinely think you guys made me so excited on

111
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,280
Overwatch. I couldn't freaking nap. I got so excited playing games with you, okay? That I

112
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:10,560
couldn't sleep because normally my nap time's like two hours before I would finish that stream

113
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:18,080
usually and I think because I blew past that I was like... Too bad for me. I don't have an ocean

114
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,040
wheel or I like all of you for different reasons. Too bad? No, I mean that's good. I mean you play

115
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,840
the whole game and I appreciate everyone's attempts and efforts because everyone tried really hard.

116
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:34,960
It is a new medium. I said to the girls like, I'm opening to doing another thing as well. That VN

117
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,960
thing. If you actually want to hold some VN, I'll shut you up. I could probably make that happen

118
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,920
a couple of months down the line. Holy fuck, hold on. Hold on. Oh, let me be clear. You need

119
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
to give me any time to cook on that one because you can't just smack out a video game skill.

120
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,080
Great. Looking for it. I was asking because my country loves censorship. I'm so sorry you're in

121
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,520
North Korea, refund. Thank you MNS188 for the super chat. I'm fighting and I was like,

122
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,680
can you even joke about that? What, fucking King Jong-un's fucking watching this stream right now?

123
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,080
What the fuck now? The fuck? The book? Uh, debate it, Laura. Thank you for the super chat.

124
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,880
No, you're not trolling me. That King. King Jong-un. Um, dude. Each of the girls appealed to me

125
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,400
at least in some capacity. Oh, that's cute. Wouldn't mind to hold some VN. I actually

126
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,320
would play the fuck out of it. I'm South Korean. I might get targeted.

127
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,480
Thank you.

128
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,760
Strongly in

129
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,880
today run. TCG card shop simulator prologue. That's the best. I ain't got nothing else

130
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,640
in the tank for you. Sorry. I ain't got nothing else. I ain't got nothing else.

131
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,000
Jai jacazae. Thank you for the extended membership. Itchio has a donation option

132
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,480
before download. Would that go to you all? No, it would go to the developer. Um,

133
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,280
if you want to tip because you felt ever so inclined, because I ate, I can't believe I'm,

134
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,880
oh my God, I'm not a good mother. I'm going to say something so real. Because I ate the cost,

135
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,200
if you want to tip, then feel free to tip me. But don't actually feel inclined. Like as I said,

136
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,480
I ate the cost because I worked for it. Please don't worry. I worked my little,

137
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,680
I worked my strong zoo off as I found out my nickname means strong zoo. My nickname means

138
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,440
something, something like that. Right. Anyways, can I have my cup of tea? Right. Once I finish

139
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
my cup of tea, we'll play this game. It's a knockoff of supermarket simulator. Apparently,

140
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,360
it's not by the same dev team. Um, it looks so much like it's by the same dev team. They've

141
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,280
just put it under a different freaking name. Okay. I enter chat and then I leave. No,

142
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,840
oh, she's just a mutual fan. But I really like stronti's model here. We heard your chat,

143
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,440
recuperate investment costs. No, no, we're going to have to go through my donuts on stuff all over

144
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,880
again. I need to really start it from the start. This game is pretty neat. I can't wait until it

145
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,720
actually fully comes out. It looks so cute. I want to see if we can collect all the yards.

146
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,400
And so this is basically Pokemon pack cell and simulator. If you know what Pokemon packs are,

147
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:35,040
um, just the heads up stronti Aussie's harsh on lollipop content. Oh, you'll never guess who's

148
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:45,440
hosting the game. No, no, we're not hosting the game. I'm not the game. I'm not the publisher.

149
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,880
Well, I'm not publishing it. I'm, I'm, I'm show mommy. Sometimes I can rub my brain cells together

150
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,400
just a little bit. What game? I got here late. The vealer game. Vealer is going to have a game.

151
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,640
Here's my tip. Thank you. Crazy. Jesse for the tip. I mean, you're not wrong.

152
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,640
Stronti, please don't pay for refunds. No, I think I will. No, honestly, because I was like,

153
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,960
oh, you don't have to do it. Right. Let me finish his tea first.

154
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,400
Here's a smart girl. You are. I'm going to train you guys to like my panting. I don't care.

155
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,560
Mommy's always two step forward. Wait, what was that? Nica Caddo avocado thingy? I'm always two

156
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:45,680
steps ahead of you. Wait, Nica Caddo. You're just here in the background. I'm always two steps ahead

157
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:58,240
of you. That's so cute. Are you ready? Oh my God, male voices. Two steps ahead. I am always two

158
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,320
steps ahead. Meet me at the Australian government. That's not funny because I could get kicked out

159
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,080
of this country at any minute. That's not funny. I have business to conduct in this country. Please

160
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:20,240
grant me. Please grant me my visa. I don't think I can watch that. Oh, a little bit too on the news

161
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,840
there. Thanks again for the extended membership. Jackie as well. What happens if you get kicked

162
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,680
out? So if I get kicked out, I might be moving in with a VTuber.

163
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,560
What is that melody? The universe. It sings for my...

164
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,960
And who is that VTuber? I think you already know who I would be moving in with.

165
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:02,640
Yes. Oh my God, be a VTuber host when? I can't even conduct my own business in there.

166
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,880
I discussed with Syn and obviously in private about the whole situation that's going on with me.

167
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:19,520
And literally, as I was explaining it, she taped, I'll just come live with me and I'm like, oh,

168
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,120
I mean, that would solve a lot of problems. Could you imagine two fucking streamers in the same

169
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:34,800
like fucking velar gated community? Oh my God, bro. Oh God, I don't know what the neighbors would

170
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,280
think though. I mean, the way I was screaming yesterday, I'm surprised the polis didn't come

171
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,000
at my door. I was only getting trouble. Be like, sorry guys, the polis are at the door.

172
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,120
He literally gatekeeper and one streamer and one discord kitten sends. Oh my God,

173
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,280
did I groom Syn to let me live with her? Syn and Strony and Codd in the same room. No,

174
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:10,400
we can even stream that. I'd be over. I'd be over. I'll let me in. Strony versus then Overwatch

175
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:21,280
too. Well, might be a thing. Yes. Yeah. Soon. How soon?

176
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm not allowed to say I don't like it.

177
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:40,080
Okay. Never beaten the Grumman allegation. Grimmed. Oh my God, Black Ops to split screen

178
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,920
one by one. Oh my God. Well, Reflens be locked in the basement in the streamer house. No, that's

179
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:55,040
where the imps go. The Reflens are under my bed. Reflens are used as my relief at the end of stream.

180
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:05,520
I finish streaming, you're all like cowering under the bed and I'm like, Refleng. Oh, Refleng.

181
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,840
I played the Black Ops 6b, I was actually pretty good. Is that real Andrew?

182
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,480
Competitive game sheets are just going to be continuous makeshift. Bro, I watched back when

183
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,960
she joined the Overwatch stream yesterday. We get so hyper around each other. Like,

184
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:33,360
genuinely so hyper. I was screaming my head off. Like, I was screaming my head off for the... I

185
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,000
was like screaming in general and then as soon as she joined, we started moaning down the mic to

186
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,160
each other like, mmm, baby girls. No, mommy, don't grape us for the 10th hour. Covering is the joke

187
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,280
I was born ready. Oh, are you sitting on top of the pillow already? You know what's coming next?

188
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:59,600
Between you and Sin, who has the pincers in your relationship? Oh, I don't mean to be mean,

189
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:07,440
but I think I have the pincers. I love Sin, but I kind of, I kind of dogged on her,

190
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,680
not dogged on her, sorry, that's the wrong terminology. I kind of told a wee thingy about her.

191
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,400
Sin can't look me in the eyes. She really struggles to look me in the eyes.

192
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,800
She just can't do it. She looks everywhere but in my eyes. And I don't know if that's just her

193
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,200
predisposition or she's shy. I don't know if she struggles with it in general or it's just me,

194
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,040
but we always have the best conversations, like looking at the floor next to each other.

195
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Ha ha ha ha, who says I'm going to be running away, mama? I'm the refling who is the danger.

196
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,160
Oh, that's good. I am the danger. Thank you, the veiler. That's actually a good one. That's a

197
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:00,320
freaking bad. So Sin is a bomb. Of course she gets hit. Sin knew that she couldn't look me in the

198
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,440
eyes because, ah, you haven't seen me in how many years she kept, well, put it this way. I'm going

199
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,800
to be surprised if all of a sudden you start looking me in the eyes. Look, that's all I'm saying.

200
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:19,200
I was saying to the reflins if my visa gets denied, I'm living way up. I'm literally your problem now.

201
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:26,960
I'm literally your child, baby. Ya cow? Ah, ya cow. Hold on. Let me finish this.

202
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,680
You leave my true autism alone. I know, but it's cute and endearing Sin. They love it. It's

203
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,080
because no one else can tell that these kind of cute things about you. Only I can see these cute

204
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:48,800
things. Sin on stream. I'm trying to think if there's any other quirky things you have that are

205
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:57,200
adorable. That, you know, obviously isn't. This is why I'm housebound. No, don't say I'm fucking

206
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,600
giving it. I'm don't say I'm turning you into a freaking housebounder. That's terrible. Right,

207
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:08,800
hopefully I'm not too big, but my watermelon in here going to that place. Oh my god, you heard it

208
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:17,280
here first. Vila remember gives a indie VTuber agriphobia via internet bullying. Oh my god,

209
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm cancelled. Oh, I'm cancelled. Oh my god, you heard it here first. I'm now paranoid that when

210
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,160
I talk to folk, I'm not looking in their eyes. Wait, what are you? Are you not aware? How did

211
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:33,040
it take you? But I think you must look your family in the eyes, surely. Maybe it's just because I'm

212
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:41,440
not a family member. Copium. Like, you must look your mum in the eyes. There's no way. There's an

213
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:54,160
ewe. She also, she also makes sin never. I mean, maybe it's the hate difference. Wait, have you

214
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:02,480
said to the imps how tall you are? I can't remember if we're told, if you've told the imps how tall

215
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:12,400
you are and really. Yeah, I'm told as fuck. Okay, okay, yeah. That's where all her confidence is.

216
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,000
As I drown myself in my tea there, did you hear that? Stronny isn't beating the house pet. Oh my

217
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,400
god, that's, I'm fucking writing that down. Oh my god, that's such a good idea. Sorry, I know it's

218
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:38,320
your idea. Yoink! Hypno house pet. Oh my god, it's in my notes. Thank you, General Therrit,

219
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,040
for the content, the extended membership. Not only did you just pay me, I just paid myself

220
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:51,360
with your idea. Thank you. Hypno house pet. Oh my god, I'm gonna cream. I have a, oh my god,

221
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,840
I had a hypnosis role play coming up and I didn't know how to do it and you have just given me the

222
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,400
fucking answer. Okay, thank you. I'm leaving now because it's roast o'clock. I'm getting bullied

223
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:11,280
guys. Oh my god, she's been pissed. VR chat says I'm smaller than Shy Lily. Nice work,

224
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,880
you've been on me. Right, we love you, Sen. Thank you for hanging. Right, no more bullying Sen because

225
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,160
you know, if I do get my visa denied, I do need somewhere to live. So let's put our stonks into

226
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,160
visa. Okay, so we are playing a game called Card Shop TCG Prologue. Now, this is not the

227
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:35,120
finished version, it is early access, but you are going to know so many simularities between

228
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:44,720
this game, this game and supermarket simulare. However, they are not by the same game dev.

229
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,160
Now, I believe that for a second. Are you kidding me right now? I believe that.

230
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:57,200
Cardi Rob, you didn't put a message. Thank you for your tip, but you didn't put a message. Cardi

231
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,760
Rob, you goofy goober. But thank you, that was very kind. Bye Sen, we love you. The scripts just

232
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,760
write themselves. It's like same assets, same layouts, same everything, but it's not by the

233
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,400
same publishers and I'm like, aha. So there's actually, I don't know if you've seen some of it,

234
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:36,720
there's been a bit of a steam brian. Oh. I can't even deny it. I'm not being funny,

235
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,920
I think Sen would actually be done. If marriage would help whatever thing that we needed, I legit

236
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:49,920
think that Sen would be done. I ain't being allegations anytime, Sen tiny spiny, thank you.

237
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:59,440
I think Sen would be done with that. I quit my day job to open my own card store. This is it.

238
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,320
Let's get down to business. Are we invited to the wedding?

239
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:14,400
I, right, this is going to be called Strony's card input. I'm sure there's,

240
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:27,600
wait, why can't I do it capital? Oh my god. And then this, no. Okay, I'm out, right. I'll just do

241
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,080
it. We'll do it as an ode to Sen since you started at the start of the stream. Strony's

242
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:40,880
card input. Wait, is that an extra space? It is. It's done. Okay, task, open phone

243
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:57,840
tab and stock up on card pack, stock order. All right. Oh, be strong. Okay, be strong.

244
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:05,200
It's very self-explanatory, so you press, it like literally is the exact same.

245
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
It's literally the exact same.

246
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,880
Like, tell me this is, how is this not, the assets are the same, like you can walk around

247
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,480
if you randomly want to walk around and there's, oh, well, you can't go as far, but like, do you

248
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:31,440
know what I mean? It's this, and it's not the same dev team. And, and I'm like, hmm, curious,

249
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:39,120
it's not the same, the sound is good. That's the sound you make when, and like the bin is out here

250
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,440
to put your, like, I don't know what to say. Is this not the same game?

251
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Sexy card seller, I am going into battle and I want your cutest cards. Yeah. Seller,

252
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,320
I tell you, I am going into battle and I want only your cutest cards. Oh, that's so cute.

253
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,600
Potion seller, I love potion seller. Oh my God, I need to do that short. That's like,

254
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,960
I keep stalling. I need to do that short. That's like, here's memes, but Scottish

255
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,560
potion seller, I'm going into battle and I need your strongest potions. Like,

256
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,960
I just need to sit down and actually do them. I keep saying, I'm going to do behind the scenes

257
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,640
stuff on ASMR as well, like shorts about it, because Emmy, oh my God, Emmy is like, inspiring me.

258
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:36,480
She's such a fucking hard worker. And she's so adorable. And I've actually been given

259
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,600
the opportunity. I hope she doesn't mind me talking about this. But I asked Emmy,

260
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,000
like, oh, are you worried to help or anything? And she said she's struggling with writing a script.

261
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,240
And I'm like, please, please let me write the script. Please, please. Please, I love you. Please

262
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,400
let me write the script. So I have the opportunity. I hope it goes well. If I fuck it up, that's on

263
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,520
me though. If I fuck it up, that's on me. Right. I need another shelf already. What is this?

264
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:14,160
Accessories shop cleanser. Shop level nine. Oh my God, you can sell plushie. Oh my God,

265
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,400
I want to make an e-girl version of this game. Right meow. Right meow. Right. How do I get...

266
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,960
Oh, it's locked. Oh, okay. Right. What do these packs sell for? The market is too...

267
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:35,520
Well, let's snipe the market. I make 90p, right? That's fine. Interact. And then this is it.

268
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,800
Man the cashier by standing behind the counter and interact. Yeah, sorry. This is the exact same

269
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:51,200
game. VTuber Shop Simulator. Her ASMR history was fun. Oh, did... You don't... That was an ASMR.

270
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,320
Are you talking to me right now? Didn't she not, you know...

271
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:16,000
No! Thank you, Groomed by Vila. It's not here yet. The collar's coming first. The dog bowl.

272
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,160
It says it's going to all arrive this month though. Because we're...

273
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,200
Danny turned on the... Sorry, that's rather loud in my head, so...

274
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,440
I'm going to need you to kindly shut the fuck up a little bit.

275
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,600
I think that's fine. What would you like? A card? 24.

276
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,640
Bro, this is the exact same game. This is Supermarket Simulator. How is it from the

277
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:56,640
different... It has to be the dev... Changes... How much? 18. 10. 15. 16. 17. 18.

278
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,440
One, two, three, four.

279
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:10,240
Take it. Hold. To give. Give. Done. Okay, it was the space bar. Sorry, jeez.

280
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,640
This is literally the exact same game. It's the same game, but with cards.

281
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,160
I'm sure there were still tingles happening. No, I don't know. I get like really

282
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,840
...preniquity when I'm like not feeling well. You know what I'm saying? Like, wait, wait, that's

283
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,040
right. Definitely looking forward to the Tour of Pricks for the Dog Call. I'm going to,

284
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,120
honestly, I'm going to hold it in my hand and then I'm going to be like, don't you want it?

285
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,560
I need to upload all the artworks I got of us because it was originally going to be an event,

286
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,600
but I don't need to do it for the event anymore because there's a new event.

287
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,720
Stand aside, old event. So, yeah, I'm going to be...

288
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,720
$2.00. You know, dose. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, my God, I'm so good at math.

289
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,600
I literally... Oh, just look at it. I like how everyone enjoys my shop. If I was walking in

290
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:18,080
the street and it was just a guy at the cashier and all I see is that it's not even flushed to the

291
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,080
wall. Bro, I ain't stuck. I'm not going in there. I'm not getting jumped. Oh, my God,

292
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:32,400
good luck with your pack. Please enjoy. Change. Giving... Oh, no, sorry. One, two, three, four,

293
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:43,200
and then 50. Hello. Hello. Good morning. Would you like a receipt with your

294
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:53,600
orger? Yeah, it looks like the front for some illegal... Literally, how did they mess it up to

295
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,360
it not being flushed with the wall? I'll change it tomorrow because I don't want to stop the

296
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,640
grab packs on the shelf and open them to get cards. Oh, my God. How did I do that?

297
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:14,800
Get away from me. Did you see that? Hold on. I ain't man the till. I saw his teethies,

298
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:24,560
but I'm not a dentist. I'm not a dentist. Right, how did it... Hold, take item.

299
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:32,800
Open pack. Oh, my God. Is this the gacha part?

300
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:46,880
What does it mean? Seedant, guppy, flammy, esmer... That flammy looks like Cinder's

301
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,280
thing around her tail. Claw. Bro. Are these AI Pokemon?

302
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:04,240
But we got all new cards. Oh, no. Oh, no, there's customers. There's customers waiting. Oh, we got

303
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:16,080
Kitsune, Baring, Helio. Oh, that's cute. Like a seeder. Are these like AI Pokemon that got drawn?

304
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,600
These are actually like genuinely look like they could be Pokemon's. Am I good mental?

305
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,200
They don't look drawn AI, but the designs are like really good. These look like Pokemon. Am I

306
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:42,160
going mental? They're so cute. Nocti, Sun, Floor, Shiloh, Hanya, Klopp. Bro, these are so cute.

307
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,040
It's like Power World. She doesn't know I can't get enough of her and left for Chid and leave.

308
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:55,360
Oh, my God. It's a fauna mansion. The hippie trooper from Hollow Life fauna, the ASMRist.

309
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:07,200
It's one of our saplings. Oh, that's so cute. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry to the customers in the

310
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:16,400
background. I'm too busy. Oh, those are so cute. Come on in. Right. Okay. Are we finished with the

311
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,520
opening? They're customers. Would someone please, like that Helio is not, it's like 3D compared to

312
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,440
the artwork. That's 3D, but then that is drawn, but that looks trace. Are you squidding me right now?

313
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,920
I'd be very curious to see the, that's look, that's look cute or whatever it's called,

314
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:41,280
Lucario or the blue fighting one. I'll look hard PhD. Thank you for becoming a member.

315
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,880
That is the blue fighting one. Come on from Pokemon. That's the blue fighting one. I like,

316
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:59,280
that's the orange one. Cloister. Come on. Nimbless. That's the blue swalloop mixed with the

317
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:08,000
balloon from Gen 5. Come on. No, these are morphed Pokemon. Oh, my God. The customers are being so

318
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,760
patient. Are you squidding me right now? The blue swalloop. I'm going to open everything and only

319
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,760
sell opened cards as a gimmick, naming my shop hot singles in your area. Oh, that's so smart.

320
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,160
A disco man's room with the volume. So it's like a really good business plan.

321
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,040
Okay, they hit each other with the big fat tits from. Oh, sorry. Oh, no, she doesn't like when

322
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:39,280
you mention them anymore. Sorry. Sorry. Desole, that was my bad. I got the memo. I was there for the

323
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:48,320
memo. See, Dan? Nanome. Oh, they're so cute. How am I getting you? I've seen you before.

324
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,240
Like that's Neubat. That's literally Neubat reskin. I'd be very curious to see what the behind

325
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,520
the scene dev notes are on this one. But I'm a sucker. I'm getting, I have to admit, when I hear

326
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,840
the little biding, when I hear the little biding, yeah, when I hear that, I'm getting a wee bit.

327
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:10,160
I'm getting a wee, a few dopamine hits inside my, that's Tor, that's what, not Torchik. The other

328
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:18,880
one. The thing in the egg. Togopee. That's Togopee. Come on. I don't know who that's supposed to be.

329
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,400
That's the, it's like Dan Manu thingy, the fire ground type in gen five where you find in the

330
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,680
desert. That's who he is. He's just a reskin. Who are you? The wee purple goblino one?

331
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,040
Oh God. I cannot remember Pokemon names. That's just Pikachu's face on a star.

332
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,000
That's just Pikachu's face on a star. Right. Uh, my apologies. Thank you everyone for waiting.

333
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,320
Why did you wait so long? As the owner of the shop just like stands opening packs. You're

334
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,560
rather p- Fucking hell. I know you're, geez, you guys are more addicted to opening these packs than

335
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,560
I am. Oh, I mean, oh my gosh, is it because she's a gamer that she stinks?

336
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,120
Honestly, me when I fire Mon-Max, you do you, darling.

337
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,680
Hi Riplin, thank you for supporting my independent business. How do I do the two? No, zero? What?

338
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,200
No. Two? All right. Sorry. Uh, take me a second there. Oh, I'm going to be such a good shop owner.

339
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,360
Let me open this box. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

340
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,880
Average card shop page and a little sniffle of Fermone Maxing.

341
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,120
Oh no, it's getting dark already. My shop's level three. How is it level three? I've never done

342
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:49,280
anything. They really said, nah, you're getting faster progress in this game. They said it takes

343
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,840
too long in supermarket simulator gift. What have I got? 30, 21 on that one? Okay, I'm going to open

344
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:03,520
up a new box until, buy a play table and put it in the shop. Tab, DIY, play table. Customers can

345
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:13,200
play card games here. Good ways to earn extra income. Extra cunts. So many of us. That's terrible.

346
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,080
Uh, right. No, we don't, we want to hide the customers. Like, if you want to enable the

347
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,800
funk sway of a shop, you need to like do it this way. How are we getting so many stinky?

348
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,320
Oh wait, is this the Yu-Gi-Oh! fan? Do you guys remember the Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament thing? They

349
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:41,920
like, they, you can ban a player for Fermone Maxing. Oh no, she's going to stink out my shop.

350
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:51,120
I can't believe it. It's a VTuber in the wild. Oh my gosh, you're real. I didn't think you guys were

351
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,520
real. Let 10 customers play in the card shop. Okay, I'll get another table then.

352
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,800
And then I'll buy another shelf. What was that other thing? I don't know.

353
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,200
Uh, right, let's get right into opening this box. Yeah, right. How about,

354
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:19,200
so the customers can see? Yeah? Yeah, like, look at the dots on the floor as well. This is,

355
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,480
this is just the same. Okay, we need to think about the funk, the funk sway of the shop. Okay,

356
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,200
how about we just put the tables at the back? So if you want a game, there's like a little section

357
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,800
for it. Oh god, the lights, the lights as well. Don't come on. Bro, this is the same dev team. I

358
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,560
don't know who they're fooling. I'm wondering if they got blocked because they have too many early

359
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,920
access games from uploading. I mean, if you have cartoon and green gas coming from you,

360
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,640
surely it's the sign you need to stop. Oh, they're actually playing against each other.

361
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,800
Oh, that's so cool. Oh, I hope you're having fun. I hope you're having fun.

362
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,800
All right, let me restock this other shelf. Or let's just put those things down.

363
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,200
Any convention is going to have smelly people? I wonder if it's just, but

364
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:19,280
thank you for your business. I wonder if it's just because people didn't get taught like how to

365
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,920
wash themselves and stuff. And like, you need to do it. Like, at least when a pheromone max,

366
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,160
a pheromone max in the comfort of me on home, like I don't need to think out the place.

367
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:35,360
For anyone else. But is that mummy in the far right corner? Are you saying I'm pheromone

368
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,360
maxing? I'm trying to like mix up the shelves, you know? I feel like if you're picking at random

369
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,680
for booster packs, you know, you want a good... I heard you can play as well. You know what,

370
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,160
you're done. Get put in the bin, crazy Jessie. You're getting put in the bin.

371
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:55,440
Right, how do I order more stuff? Order. Stop, stop. Oh, something new. We can already...

372
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
Bro, the progress in this game is so quick.

373
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,560
They literally are like, uh, yeah, we're not gonna make you wait around to play this game. Do

374
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,240
we go on? If you're gonna go out in public, please for the love of all that is wholly take a damn shower.

375
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Okay, yeah, real, true. I'm gonna sign that one off to head out. Okay, let me put the price on

376
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:28,400
these. See, like we've already got new item stuff. Right, the market price is 17. 17. 38. I'm like,

377
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,760
hey, what's up? No. Sit your pretty girl. Right, we will stream snipe the market. Wow, so cheap.

378
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,240
Okay, basic car pack. What bargain? Yeah, we don't really like, um, when we do things.

379
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:52,080
Thank you, the booty lord. We just do take showers, take off a cloth and soap bar,

380
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,760
and a scrubby-dwee-dwee-dwee-dwee all the way down. I'm doing the shower stream next week,

381
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,560
so I'll just talk through myself. I don't know if it's gonna be too loud for the microphone though.

382
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,600
That's not only worry. Do you do TCG in real life? Okay, I have a confession.

383
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:18,880
Um, and you're not gonna like it. Who is dissatisfied? I'm under, I'm under charging myself.

384
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:26,240
Um, I have a confession. I want to get into Magic the Gathering, but I don't have time to do it right

385
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,400
now, so when, you know, all is said and done, I might be getting into it. Thank you, Life's

386
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,680
Spiral Reaction for coming a member! Oh, I never checked! Hold on, pause this game. Right, the

387
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,160
game's gonna run in the background, I think. I'm like 99% sure. Did that unlock in your

388
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,200
emoteslot yesterday? Because I was getting, I was getting gifted out the wazoo. I need to check

389
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:55,840
if I've got another emoteslot. More like emoteslips. Whoa, you can't say that. Oh, right, okay, okay,

390
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,520
it was the Midsma draw one. Okay, right, no, I don't have any emoteslot. Unlock. Hello,

391
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,920
thank you for waiting, even though no one came. Oh, yes, we're open, I'm sorry! Oh my god, I'm

392
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,160
sorry, please come in, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, please come in. I'm gonna slack more, like,

393
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,440
she's only, I'm only, yeah, I'm only doing this for a tit. I'm only running this shop for player

394
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,400
attention. I'm legally retired to try and get you to play Yu-Gi-Oh. There is that Yu-Gi-Oh video

395
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:32,560
game. Eh, everyone's on Xbox. Bruh, the, the fucking AI did have, it did not care if you

396
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,400
wanted to win. The AI was like, nah, you have to earn it, bitch. I'm like, okay, Jesus. Like,

397
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,640
what role am I playing the fucking victim? Right, so I need to wait. My task is to let

398
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,720
10 customers play. Oh wait, they get animated as well?

399
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,920
You, you have animations while you play? They're thinking, they're thinking. Uh-huh.

400
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:11,120
They seem to have like a tamed anime. Oh, no, no, it's your turn. Oh shucks, you got me.

401
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:18,560
Yeah, there's online magic the gathering. Oh, there's a new player as well. Oh, no,

402
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,040
he was just curious, that's all. He just wanted to see how the game was going. You're not the

403
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,200
thinker. We're obligated to keep you away from cards, like, we keep you away from league and wow.

404
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,720
Wait, they gave me money because they played a game? Why would I get money if it's not done?

405
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,400
Wow, so cheap. Wait, what do you mean? Yeah, it's just under market price.

406
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,480
We're not, we're not a billion dollar industry. I don't have to give myself a CEO bonus at the end

407
00:48:50,480 --> 00:49:01,200
of the day. One, two, three, four. Oh my god, I'm so good at getting change. Is my hair covering up the

408
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,400
price on the register? Oops, never thought of that. A MTG waifu tier list would be something.

409
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:20,640
I read that before Brian did, thank you. KEE? It's got an E at the end of it. Is it KEE or KEE? Oh

410
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,000
my god, no, you must get KEE all the time. It has to be KEE, surely, copy them. Thank you for the

411
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:33,680
super chat. Thank you for letting me pop your super chat, Cherry. I'm gonna do

412
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:41,200
Tamiyo for Jen too. Fuck it, I'll look it up. Tamiyo? What's Tamiyo?

413
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:54,400
Sex! Oh, she's actually really... Wait, what? No, I don't know. I'm not sure about the hair like that.

414
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,280
Why? I think you're the one who's causing dissatisfied customers.

415
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,480
How is it that it's your twin and your twin doesn't have anything to say? What's going on here?

416
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,760
Is no one buying the booster boxes? Are you kidding me right now?

417
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,640
Are you scaring me? I've played MTG for decades. Yeah? The game is currently in Tatters and Hasbro

418
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:29,520
sucks. I hope you can find some enjoyment out of it. Oh, I'm so sorry. That sucks. It sucks when

419
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:37,600
stuff like that happens. When like something that you love gets like wrecked out of your

420
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:44,960
overwatch one. Disco Mansor. I'm so sorry to hear that about Magic Together. I thought it did rather

421
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,880
well. Yeah, I do have animations. They're just hiding them from me. Okay, maybe I should restock

422
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:58,800
the shelves a bit instead of a rambling away. What's this? Yeah, see, you just need to like...

423
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,480
Oh, I don't have enough money for whatever this is. Sure, a purchase and then... What are you?

424
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,800
Oh, it's just like our big ass box. Oh yeah, we restocking with these bad boys.

425
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,360
Tatters is an exaggeration, but big company bad. Is it just like they keep coming out with stuff that

426
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:27,040
anyone's really, you know, fussed for? Actually, I do have a Pokemon... Oh, I do have a Pokemon

427
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:36,800
card opening stream planned. I don't know if that's cringe though. I just like always wanted to get

428
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:44,400
like a Pokemon card box and open them and see what was inside. Money ruins everything. Look,

429
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,640
when they said that money is the root of all evil, I took that person like...

430
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,320
Oh no, it's the cause of all evil? Or is it the root of all evil? Why aren't these selling? Is anyone

431
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,720
bought in? Oh no, they have kind of bought them. Oh, we get much more profit on the actual box sales

432
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,720
though. Buy a card shelf and put it in the shop. I mean, I'll buy another one. I don't have enough

433
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:19,360
money. Oh no, he's waiting for someone to play with. I'll sit with you. I'll play with a game with

434
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:24,320
you. I'm sorry. I don't know how to sit in the chair. Oh, I feel so bad. The refunds just wanted to

435
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:30,080
play with someone. No, my darling. I promise someone's going to come play with you in a minute. I'm sure

436
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:37,760
the AI code did someone to come play with you. Money is the root of all evil. Fine, I'll do it

437
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:45,280
myself. I only got into Magic the Gathering for the Doctor Who collab. What? Right, I'm going to be

438
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,520
honest. The reason why I know about Magic the Gathering, apparently there's really sexy waifu

439
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,400
cards and there's like these pic talks about it and it's like when someone has the Magic the

440
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,600
Gathering deck is like only sexy waifus and stuff and I was like, I mean, not going to lie, that

441
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,120
probably be me with the deck because that's how I pick like my Pokemon as well. Like if the Pokemon

442
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,920
looks nice, I'll pick it. If it's an ugly Pokemon, I didn't win it in my deck. I'm tired of having

443
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:20,400
cute adorable evolution stage one Pokemon and then by stage three, it's like this big ugly,

444
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:28,720
bubbly thing. I'm talking about you Mudkip. You are so precious and you're stage one evolution

445
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:37,120
Mudkip. Who the fuck approved of Swamper? Swamper with the little beady eyes, little pixelated beady

446
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:46,960
eyes at the end of the fin flap? Who, who did that? Bro, Mudkip is adorable. I love Mudkip.

447
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:57,920
Exactly. That's why you guys are allowed to ink for free around these parts.

448
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,840
But you got merit though. Thank you the Veil Lord. You got merit though. Agriculture is a

449
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:13,600
root of all evil. Agriculture is in food supply? Little puny, guardie-vower? Oh my god. I'm getting

450
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:27,600
sh- god damn we got a baller. Was it payday mister? Geez. Uh and cash? And exact change?

451
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:35,440
Thank you Reefling. Now go play to your heart's content. Go. No, okay. Just,

452
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,200
you just want to check out the match, how the match was going. Yeah damn he wanted those packs.

453
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,680
Thank you. Right, I am to buy a shelf. Are you squidding me right now? I think, wait no,

454
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,920
what am I to buy? Buy a card shelf. They say greed is the root of all evil, but I think the seed

455
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,440
that started the roots is scarcity itself. Without scarcity how can someone be greedy?

456
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,720
Are you squidding me right now? Artificial scarcity. Oh I'm going to say look up Balan,

457
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:10,160
wandering night jumpstart 2022. There's anime altar versions of waifu cards too. Are you squidding

458
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:18,080
me right now? Don't slander the swampert. Right, no. If I, if it was like oh what would you rather

459
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:25,920
hug? Uh a big ass swampert that's like a fucking, like I don't know with his wee beady eyes or an

460
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:32,480
adorable little mudkip that goes. If you think mudkip to swampert is bad, don't ever look up

461
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:40,320
it into incineroar. That's much, much, much, much, much, much worse. Incineroar?

462
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:49,600
Now hold on a minute, hold on a minute. General Theric, I'm going to say is look up Balan,

463
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:59,440
wandering night. Balan, wandering night. There's a main altar, wondering night?

464
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,880
A wolf?

465
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:14,240
It's a wolf? One, one is a girl and one is a wolf. I assume I'm supposed to look at the waifu.

466
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:20,800
Hey wait, what? The one version's a fucking furry and then one version's a chick.

467
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:27,920
Oh, thank you for your, uh, your support. Sorry, hold on. I'm, I'm looking up

468
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,800
sexy magic to gathering cards. Please forgive me. Sorry, let me, let me pop them lights on there

469
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:41,520
to excuse me. M and A, one, eight, eight. Don't slander the swampert. Maybe I will. Maybe I will.

470
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:49,360
Tiny spiny. If you think thingy, look up Litten, Litten. Okay, let's do it, let's do it. Everybody,

471
00:56:49,360 --> 00:57:04,000
let's get Litten. Is that a joke? I'm going to put it on screen. No, I'm not because it's not a

472
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:13,280
fucking PNG. Give me a PNG, you bitch. Don't be scared. Uh, my fellow Americans. Don't be scared. Hold

473
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,800
on. I'm gonna just drag it into VTuber Studio. Remember that time that person said don't drag

474
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,880
stuff into VTuber Studio or your dogs yourself? Oh, there's no customers, by the way. I'm not paying

475
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:32,320
attention. Where's the, I download a file and it never shows up. Come on. VTuber Studio? Hello?

476
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:45,200
Hello? Is the image too big? Hello? VTuber Studio? Hello? Okay, I guess we'll do it this way.

477
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:51,120
Maybe the image is too big like your peepee. Why would it be too big?

478
00:57:51,120 --> 00:58:04,240
Oh, there it is. Sorry, that took me a whole second. Okay, maybe too big for VTuber Studio.

479
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,440
Oh my God, it's humongous. Customers, please don't come to the desk. I'm so sorry, I'm not paying

480
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:18,000
attention. Right, so how do you start with something so kawaii-ny? It's on fours. That's

481
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
cute. I like the wee whiskers coming off of it. And then, yeah, I can see it form like it's getting

482
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,640
stronger, it's leveling up. It's got claws now, yeah. And then, where the fuck is that?

483
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:42,720
No, I do not accept. Sorry, customer, I was on the phone looking at

484
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:51,840
the fucking Pokemon we hate. Yeah, that's not it. I don't know, literally just turns into a furry.

485
00:58:52,560 --> 00:59:01,360
That's the champ. Is it a good thing? Put cards, put 10 cards on card shelves, set a price for them.

486
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,640
R to open album? Oh no, do I not have any? I must have to have some duplicates.

487
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:20,480
Am I on? Yeah, okay, I'll sell duplicates. How do I sell it? Close album?

488
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:28,320
Okay, we'll get rid of some duplicates, because I don't, I actually want to try and collect all

489
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:35,040
the cards. I don't know how to, I assume we get like more premium, or because we start to get

490
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:44,800
duplicates really quickly. Okay, uh-huh. I know they only sell for like a penny or whatever, but I'm

491
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:55,280
not really wanting to go mental on them. I'll just get rid of the duplicates. Either they want them or

492
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:03,600
they don't. Right, how does the price on them, market price? Oh, I think I'm going to upsell

493
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,640
in the single cards. You know how it is. You know how it is, we're going to upsell in the,

494
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:16,480
are you squiddin' me right now? If you want to see wild evolution charts, you've got to check out

495
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:24,800
some Digimon evolution lines, smiley face. Digimon's mental though, they like, it'll start out really

496
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,520
cute. I've seen the meme examples, like something starts off really cute, and then all of a sudden

497
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:37,760
it just has an AK-47 attached, and everyone's like, um, that escalated quickly. Um, let's see,

498
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:47,520
0.8, what an upcharge. I'm really, I'm really busting the customers' balls over this price range,

499
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:56,800
unfortunately. I think they do sell like, single cards like this for more. I don't even touch

500
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:09,200
smogon anymore. What's smogon? Smogon. I don't, if that's all these nut strokes, I think I didn't

501
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:19,760
work because I'm foreign. Because of my accent. I would hug both if it is funny. Oh, it is so cute.

502
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,840
Oh, smogon is sweaty compared to pokon. Yeah, literally, I genuinely thought it was like smogon

503
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:36,560
with all my balls. I was like, oh, okay. Um, get rekt. Vol, vol, tuh, kin, if you, oh, maybe we

504
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:45,840
should. I saw Shiby did like, the pokemon smasher pass, so I'm familiar, I'm familiar. Now don't

505
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:49,840
be like, oh my god, you must have infinite knowledge because you said you're familiar, relax.

506
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:57,360
I've played or I'm aware of generation one to five in pokemon. Pokemon black, I believe,

507
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:07,120
is generation five. And then that is where my knowledge stops. I tried to play, um, what's that

508
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:16,720
game? Oh, I'm gonna get more boxes actually. I tried to play the, did I even have enough money?

509
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,520
I have enough money for one. I tried to play the generation that came after. It was like,

510
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:33,040
was it aloha or something? And I kid you not, the dialogue killed me. I literally was like, I could

511
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:42,000
not play the game. I think I got to like the first gym and it was still going. It was going and going

512
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:48,480
and going and going. And I was like, wrap it up and I just gave up. It just would not stop. The

513
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:57,280
dialogue would not stop. And so, I'm very familiar with pokemon emerald ruby, you know, your version

514
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:06,080
of it. Three dollars, one, two, three. One, two, one. Thank you for buying the cards though.

515
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:16,800
You don't have 20 cents on you, sir. You're making me do math. You're making me do math first thing

516
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:26,320
in the morning. Gen seven, the Hawaii. What was gen six then? How did I mess up so badly?

517
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,320
This is very comfy cozy. I've had a long week, so something cozy helped.

518
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,000
Thanks for being awesome, cozy. I'm glad you like it. No, it's definitely chilly. Unfortunately,

519
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,880
tomorrow's cold alarm is also getting swapped out for something shorter. I don't know what,

520
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,520
but I'll start. I'll feel better the day after tomorrow. I'll be me again.

521
01:03:52,720 --> 01:04:01,760
So, gen six was France. Encontre mes yeux. I summon my pokemon from Zybol.

522
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,760
Yeah, I don't. Gen six was X and Y. Did I play X?

523
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:25,280
Change. I don't know if I played pokemon. Right, we're gonna have to start putting a sign up.

524
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,560
Look, I don't judge anyone for their habits at home, but in public, if you're making me inhale

525
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:38,400
your fucking scent, no, you're done. I can't afford to make more accounts for your simulator's

526
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:47,760
streams. Stop questioning me. So just take my birthday. It's your birthday. I don't know if you

527
01:04:47,760 --> 01:05:00,240
guys saw it. So this is the inspector for roller coaster tycoon. This is also Gary. It was Gary

528
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:06,080
the inspector. And then this is also Dennis that was spray painting the side of my gas station

529
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:13,840
simulator. And like the mum as well. And like Elon Musk even in the mix at one point as well.

530
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:24,160
Coconut bombs all thank you so much and happy birthday. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday.

531
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:34,640
I don't know if you saw the Twitter interaction. I don't know if you've deleted it or not,

532
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:43,680
but like I go on Twitter and it's like role playing is me opening up my gas station simulator

533
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:49,280
and it's like, oh, I'm so happy. It's my first thing you feel. I have seven day alternative

534
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:55,680
accounts, honestly. Actual official rule in Yugu. You can't stink too bad. Yes. I love that rule.

535
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,960
I remember seeing an online thing. I don't know if it was a magic the gathering meme where it was

536
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:08,480
like someone's butt crack was out. Oh, painting one. Thank you for the 10 gifted memberships.

537
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:15,520
Congrats to those who caught it with their face. Thank you. I love how you use the

538
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:24,240
zero thing is so cute. I don't care. I'm sorry. I demand unity. I just love my door so much.

539
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,080
It's just so nice. Like I don't know if anyone like please don't ever get so

540
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,960
give me that back. How'd that take it back?

541
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:42,000
I don't fuck it. Just take it. Just take it. It's 5 cent. I think I think the business will

542
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:50,400
survive. I'm too lazy. Right. 19.2. Thank you again. Pentium one for the extent of membership.

543
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,600
Although please don't ever at the extent no for the 10 gifted memberships and congrats to those

544
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,880
who caught it and please enjoy the emotes. I promise I promise I'm getting actual emotes soon.

545
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,920
All right. They're going to be real emotes soon. Right. I'm just going to do this.

546
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,240
Until the screen goes green. Wow. I got to get me one of these.

547
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,880
Can you guys please buy my duplicates?

548
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:23,120
Yes. I would like to put it. I literally can't put it down. I can't. Okay. That's cool. Can you

549
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:30,880
put it down on? I can't. Okay. Something's not. I'm glitching. Oh. Can you go away please?

550
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:39,600
Okay. Let's. Let's. I don't know why. Yeah. Okay. It just bugged out a little bit.

551
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:48,240
Okay. I need to try and sell these cards for my next mission. It says sell 10 cards.

552
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:54,880
Ooh. Feeling lucky today. Are you? Yes. Of course. Anything for you.

553
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,520
See. I love when the reflins support my independent business. Okay.

554
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,880
Yeah. They're so supportive. Real and true. Okay. And you give me the exact change as well.

555
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:16,000
Damn. That's a lot of reflins coming in. All yours. Yay. Did you get animated? Oh, no.

556
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:23,200
Right. Okay. Let's put my duplicates. Bonk. All right. And then let's price this one.

557
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:31,280
I'm really breaking the, breaking the balls. You know me. A little ball breaker I am.

558
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,440
Anyone else want to identify as a ball breaker? We just need to sell five more cards.

559
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:50,080
Strangely, I want to lick you. What? A plastic chipper shirt. Oh my god. I used to get those

560
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:56,160
from the corner shop when I was wee. Oh. I don't even know how I'm alive right now

561
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:04,400
after consuming that. God, this place is. It makes me sick thinking about them.

562
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:10,400
Sherbert is so good, but I'm going to say the most obvious and dumb thing, but I so sugary.

563
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,280
Like, I don't know how I was like, my tiny little body when I was like, what, five-year-old?

564
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:21,920
Down in an entire Sherbert line. Bruv. Bruv. I don't know what I was thinking.

565
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:29,520
May I go membership? Yeah. Maybe. Maybe I hypnotize you into doing it.

566
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,360
A lane. Oh listen, it is in a lane.

567
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:42,880
Sugar overdose in a single litm. An American equivalent sounds like a go-kart.

568
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:53,440
Why can't I buy dice? I can sell dice? Hold on a minute. Hold on, I need a new shelf then, don't

569
01:09:53,440 --> 01:10:02,160
know. Oh, this shelf goes both ways. Check out counter? Yeah, available in full version.

570
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,320
All right, so there is more unlockable stuff. So I can hire a refland in this game.

571
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:12,160
On the other side of the game is the exact same. Like, you're not really feeling anyone.

572
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:21,600
They want dice. I need, I'm gonna need more shelves. Oh my god, the figures are so cute.

573
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:28,000
Right, I need more shelves. Let's get, we'll do two. Two more shelves and then we'll do the dice.

574
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:37,120
Uh, lit. Can I rotate? Rotate with R. E-E-E-E-E. Oh, no, I've done it too far. Can you rotate the other

575
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:44,000
way? Okay, well, we're just gonna do a little 360. Hold on. Okay, we'll go to that time.

576
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,880
Oh shit, they have code in the window that they don't like.

577
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:56,400
Uh, I feel like this shop isn't laid out very well, but hey ho.

578
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,440
I'll try, I'll just stick that there. Hi, thank you for waiting.

579
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:09,600
Well, I'll play a rearrange furniture simulator. No, nothing. Uh, you would like a whole 80 cents.

580
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:16,960
Oh yeah. Are those the things that is eatable paper? Those are spaceships. Alien spaceships is

581
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:28,000
what we call them. Um, I, I could put it, hold, hold on. Can I move you a little like over here?

582
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:33,440
Yeah, that would be gorgeous. That would be stunning. And then I'm going to move a third one

583
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,600
here and then I'll get the double ones like here so it's like a wee ale that you can go down.

584
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:46,320
Uh, Roy. And then I can buy dice. What's the dice?

585
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,680
Oh, good. How much?

586
01:11:52,080 --> 01:12:00,560
And cleanser? Storm. What the hook? Oh, flying saucers. That's what we alien discs.

587
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,400
Flying saucers. Yeah, they got a sherbet on the inside. New business idea, convention.

588
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,840
There should be a booth where someone sprays you with deodorant while VTuber berates you for being

589
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:15,680
stinky. I always thought that idol, like the Japanese idol, like meat ingredients are so

590
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:23,280
cute because they like hold your hand and stuff. And they like look you in your eyeballs and that.

591
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:29,280
Sorry, I keep losing five cents every time I do that, but I'm not familiar with your funny American

592
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:35,200
money. Right, fifth day and then one, two. Okay, that's it. Fifth day and one, two. I'm just over

593
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:41,760
complicating it. Um, I think I might be a woman. I sit with my legs crossed without popping them.

594
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:50,400
Is that popping your legs? I'll say it again. Those ladies are too attractive for this show.

595
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:58,160
Lining. Hydration check. Oh my God. No, don't pay me money to. Yes, I will drink, but don't give me

596
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:12,880
money for them. Thank you crazy, Jesse. And thank you. Don't give me money. Just say hydration.

597
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:20,400
You can just type hydration check. You can just type hydration check. Okay. If you hit the wrong

598
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:34,560
angle, pop. You're winky. Oh, you pop your balls. Oh, is that what you mean when when guys say like,

599
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:40,240
oh, if I sat like that, I'd sit on my wee balls. Um,

600
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:45,600
um, Linnie's engineering. Do you prefer cola with or without?

601
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,840
Not only are you stinking up my shop, you're stinking up my counter.

602
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,800
Um, I'm going to have to restock soon, but no one's buying anything. So I can't restock it.

603
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:06,560
Um, I prefer cola from the fridge with no ice. I wouldn't put ice in it normally. I just drink

604
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,840
straight from the can. Oh, for some reason, glass cola tastes better. Glass cola tastes better,

605
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:19,280
right? I need to fill up these shelves. My goodness. Can you buy it? Okay. They're bought the card,

606
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:29,520
so we unlock the next task. The task is in the top left. Thank you very much. You are the little

607
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:37,280
man. Okay, I'm getting there. Successfully complete 100 checkout. Well, people aren't

608
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:43,520
even buying, so is anybody looking at me? Oh, live spiral reaction. Thank you for the 10

609
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:52,640
gifted memberships. Congrats to those who cut them with your face. Please enjoy your emotes.

610
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:59,600
Yes, there's a pregnancy mode. No, I will not explain further. I listened to my pregnancy,

611
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:07,120
ASMR. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have looked up the codes. Like, I looked up a very unique, um,

612
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:16,160
ooh, big spender. I looked up an incredibly unique plot the other day. And now,

613
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:24,160
I don't think I was, I kind of want to be pregnant with you again. I don't know how to say it.

614
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:32,800
Insert minecraft bot. Oh, again, all that XP. Hi, Riflin. Would you like to buy anything else?

615
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,400
I'm so sorry. There's nothing on that shelf. I am so sorry. It's just a, it's a misinput.

616
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,880
I think maybe I'll put the card thing there and then I'll put the shelves over there.

617
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:52,720
See, if I start as the next day, I'd be missing out on these sales. A dollar, 20. Right, you come over

618
01:15:52,720 --> 01:16:00,240
here and then you, you don't, yeah, you don't really need like, okay, not to cost of the door though.

619
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:07,680
I guess we'll do an ale. Oh, sorry. Wait, queue to move it, then rotate.

620
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:16,480
I kind of want to like separate the playing area. Are you squiddin' me right now?

621
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,720
So you have a bit of privacy, like at the playing area. So it's like,

622
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:24,880
you're not on display, like you have your own little bit here and then we can open up like a

623
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:34,160
little self-serve ramen bit in it as well. We love staring into the void. It's such a

624
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:39,280
comfort. I really like it. I don't know, like I'm so tempted to do it again. I want to do it again.

625
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:45,840
Right, can I order? Thank you. Messed up BrainSpeak for the membership

626
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,480
and thank you again, Live Spiral Reaction for the gift.

627
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:03,120
I seem to make way, oh no, I was going to buy days, wasn't I? I still didn't have enough for days.

628
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:08,800
What's this, then? 150? Brov booster packs is.

629
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:16,080
I'm too poor. My fellow Americans, I shouldn't have done that.

630
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,760
All I can do is buy one.

631
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:30,240
And the delivery, wait, what? I'm not going to make it. Only guy she mass, I'm not going to make it.

632
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:36,480
It was so comforting, would love a sequel. Oh, I'm so good. No, I definitely, like I was

633
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:41,600
listening to my ASMR yesterday, like my newest video that came out. I was getting nice comments.

634
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,640
Actually, someone sent a really nice marshmallow about it. You know who you are.

635
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:52,240
They were like, I know you don't, I know you worry like about, oh my god, thank you for

636
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:58,400
letting me pop your super cherry as well. Live Spiral Reaction. Someone left the marshmallow.

637
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,560
I didn't expect it. They were just like, I know you get worried that you're not doing real ASMR

638
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:08,640
when you do your ramble stuff, but it literally quietens my brain so much when I listen to it,

639
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:14,640
because you're like very clearly passionate about whatever you're rambling about, even though like

640
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:20,400
you're supposed to be like whispering and quiet and relaxing, but you get so excited you speed up

641
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:27,520
type thing. And it was really nice. And I'm like, oh, I'm like, shit, if you want more rambling ASMR,

642
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:34,080
like one, I don't have to prepare a script. The only thing, please don't come behind the

643
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:42,400
counter, sir. The only thing I would say about it is it takes longer to subtitle. Like if you

644
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:50,720
look at the subtitles in that video that just came out, you can tell it took a hot second to

645
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:57,920
like get anywhere with it, to get anywhere with it. Because I was putting like we notes in it.

646
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:03,280
We like things that are hidden. So like if you didn't watch the video, there's like a few things

647
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,480
with the subtitles like me making little jokes and all that. Honestly, you're laughing make your

648
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:24,720
yapping makes EP. But thank you again, live spectrum. I'm just smashing your name together.

649
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:33,840
Live sparrow reaction for the bra. I cannot do math and talk at the same time.

650
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,200
For the gifted memberships and the tip on top as well. I really love to listen to it. It feels

651
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:44,160
like I'm just chilling with my friend and my license company. Yeah, it's really nice because

652
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:50,240
I love to prepare and like, I don't have to retake things either. Like when I do a roleplay,

653
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:56,240
I'll do a few retakes on sentences. Like I don't know if maybe I should. Oh no, I've shown

654
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:03,040
one example. I don't know in what ASMR roleplay it was. I started at the start, but I purposely

655
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:09,920
left it in just to show you like what it's kind of like for me. A wee bit. Like it's a little very

656
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,840
boring. I listened to it on repeat for a couple hours sitting at my desk and then I fell asleep

657
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:19,520
to it when went bed two. It didn't work. I would say I'm worried if you listen to ASMR at work,

658
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,400
it'll put you, bro, no one's buying in. Everyone get the fuck off the tables and buy shit. I'm like

659
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:32,960
stuck on this task. No one's buying. Thank you crazy Jesse. Please stop going behind the

660
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:45,920
counter. Do I need to move the counter? For the super chat. Yeah. The, oh my God, please,

661
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:52,080
can I come out with a sentence and do math at the same time? Right there. Take it. And I

662
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,800
never even got to the end. I just fall asleep before every time. See, that's the kind of ASMR

663
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:03,600
roleplays I like making where you never even find out what the ending is. Some people have asked for

664
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:12,160
like a one hour roleplay where I do talk through the whole thing and I'm like, it's intimidating,

665
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:18,480
but I'm not being funny. I will do anything you ask for because I'm getting really excited to finish

666
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:24,960
up like editing the recorded ASMRs. So then we can come up with plots that you want for the reward

667
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:31,840
system. Because I would like, how am I shop level five? I feel like I'm doing this just standing here.

668
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:37,120
Yeah, he's just watching over. He's conveying them. He's a conveyance though.

669
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:47,200
Anything? Anything? I don't know. I just like making content you guys actually want to see

670
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:54,320
versus just taking a shot in the dark. Because the next, the next,

671
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:07,280
the next one's just ear brushing, no talking. Like I got, it's like, I'm moving in it visually,

672
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:11,760
but there's nothing said in it. And it's like, I'd rather make stuff that you guys genuinely

673
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:18,240
want to hear and see. And it makes me happier doing it that way. Sometimes I listen to ASMR

674
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,800
when I need to go shopping and my social anxiety acts up. It's so embarrassing if people could hear.

675
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:29,920
I think it's just, whatever makes life easier for you, like, I hope like you don't actually

676
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,320
feel like ashamed or anything for it. Like whatever makes life easier because life is tough enough

677
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:41,200
of it. I'm sorry about that actually. See you later. Who would that make? Checkmate. Who would that

678
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:47,040
make ASMR? Did he fart? Wait, what did that just hear? Did someone just, did I hear an infarct?

679
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,280
No, I think it's the music. Sorry. Sorry. I think there's some sort of music thing going on.

680
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:01,760
It sounded like Brian farted at the end of that text to speech. I'm so sorry. I was like, who's

681
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:09,680
farting? Xerion, thank you for the tip. I don't know how I would do the,

682
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:18,720
I don't know how would you do, I could do a wedding night. ASMR, but I'd be getting off

683
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:25,520
the load would be peeking the audio. It would ever smelt at Delta. Oh my god, I've not heard that in

684
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:36,240
years. Whoever rhymed it, climbed it. This is tempting. Inspires me that you take feedback

685
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:42,720
because it just says you're still willing to grow. Yeah, I'd like, so I prepared some content before

686
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:53,040
debut, but I wrote in membership streams, I write what the refillings want on Patreon, and it just

687
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:58,480
feels so much more fulfilling when like that audio comes together because I'm like, oh my god, they,

688
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:04,960
they wanted it. Plop, plop, plop. Okay, we can buy dice. Tab, right, escape the counter. Tab,

689
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:18,160
stock order. Dice, one please, even though it's, I'm a, what's 21 take away seven? 14 cent short

690
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:26,560
because of the delivery fee. Okay, I will wait until someone does something. Order, stop. I'm

691
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:33,840
trying so hard, okay. Whoever pointed the finger, did the zinger? I've never heard that. Reverse

692
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:39,360
comfort roleplays are probably my favorite, where the listener helps ASMR. Oh, that's cute.

693
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,760
I don't know how I would do that though. I just come to you when I'm really bummed out,

694
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,440
and then you just play with my hair, and I get to put my head on your chest,

695
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:54,880
or maybe your tummy, because your tummy all nice and squishy. All I need is

696
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:01,280
Moments company, the rest is all just bonus. Mommy, I want my dice. I'm trying so hard. I literally

697
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,960
need someone to buy like, oh, there you go. There you go. There you go. I got your dice. Look, I got

698
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:11,120
your dice. I got your dice. Jingle, jingle, jingle. Okay, let's see what's going on here.

699
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,360
Uh, let's pop them here. Actually, I probably should have put them there. No, can I put you

700
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:28,560
back in the box? Okay, the dice and miscellaneous items are going to go on this one. Oh, wait,

701
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,760
there's more in here. Is there more? The box has no item in it. Okay, there's no more. Right,

702
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:42,800
let's see what the dice, what are you? Market price is 18 while we're undercut slightly.

703
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:51,200
Oh, they are the 20 die. Good afternoon. Thank you for waiting. Sorry,

704
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,480
I was just restocking the shelves. You know what it's like one man army.

705
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:02,560
Hardly working or working hard. Yeah. All yours. All yours. Thank you.

706
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,320
Mm hmm. Examples are re, rescuing a cat girl or something.

707
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,520
Scottish onomatopoeia, ASMR. What's onomatopoeia?

708
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:31,600
Where is the room? See, it even has the break room. This is the same developers. It even has

709
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:39,520
the break room. Like, come on, this is literally where let me in. Let me in. I need door. I don't

710
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:50,880
have door handle jiggle.mp3. How about we just play an ego sound? Let me in. Let me in. Or how about that?

711
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:51,860
Yeah.

712
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,760
Me when I can't open the door to the reef lens.

713
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:11,200
One, two, one, one. Thank you for waiting. Good luck in your booster pack. I wish you

714
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:19,040
all the pools that you could ever ask for. Okay, the shelves are like fucking embarrassing. Holy

715
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:25,840
crap, I need to. Now, I'm going to suggest something. If you move a little to the left,

716
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:30,560
or you move a little to the right. Mm. Oh no, you both need to go left because you're facing the

717
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:44,240
same way. Sorry. Right, tab or, or dare. And then, how is that 91? Am I going mental?

718
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:54,560
Oh, no, I have 91 bucks. Bro, my shelves are barren. Vampire's squid girl needs a blood

719
01:27:54,560 --> 01:28:03,680
feeding. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Maybe. Right, what was that other thing we could buy? Accessories?

720
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:22,640
Oh, 159, aren't you? A deck box, red, more 20s. Shop level seven required. A collector's book?

721
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:28,000
Oh, I guess if you're pulling cards, that makes sense. So this is as much cards as we can pull.

722
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:37,760
Okay, je comprends. Figures are 500. It's a bit of an investment, right? I think cleanser's probably

723
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:45,360
next and then like the different dice types. I'm going to be honest, I'm struggling to pay my bills.

724
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:52,640
My bills are paying. Do I need more tables? I don't know. I don't, I'd rather they spend money on that.

725
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:57,040
I mean, look, I get it. The shelves are a bit barren. Okay, they're a bit barren, but I'd rather

726
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:03,120
they spend money so I can invest it in more products. Like, what was my, I make six, almost

727
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:13,440
seven dollars profit. Profit is six dollars and then on the weans, it's just under a dollar. Yeah,

728
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:20,160
I just need, I just need someone. Yeah, like I need you. I need you. You, you, you. You guys

729
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:31,040
seen Blues Brothers? It's a really good one. I need you. Yeah, yeah. I need you. Okay, that's good.

730
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,760
We can, no, we still can't stock the freaking cleanser thing.

731
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,640
Right, how much is the cleanser? I just want to get it so there's like a variety.

732
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:51,680
159. Oh, the goose drank wine. I wonder when it cost her on a car shop. It's a shame because

733
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:57,600
they're all shutting down. Like these independent things are all shutting down. I remember the,

734
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:07,120
I think three shut down that I knew of from my whereabouts. And like they did, they had the

735
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:11,520
tables and everything for people to come in and play. Is it this, I think the stink maybe puts

736
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:19,200
off a new customer? No, she doesn't seem to care. Um, God, I'd be the first. Literally,

737
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:24,320
this is the storage room that's behind the shop and then I guess you extend into the next building.

738
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:30,000
Please don't walk behind the counters. Thank you. Don't do that again.

739
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:37,440
Maybe I'm supposed to be selling booster packs. I don't, I'll put it, can I move it?

740
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:47,120
Oh, I can. Right, everyone stop coming behind the counter, okay? Because I'll be coming around

741
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:54,960
the counter when I come. Right, no, hold on. It has to be this, like this, okay? Okay, thank you for

742
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:00,960
waiting. I think once the shop expands as well, it'll probably look a lot better.

743
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:14,800
Makima cosplay? When? Taking us for walkies? Oh, is she the one with the yellow eyes?

744
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,840
That always gets drawn with the werewolves.

745
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:26,880
I like it. That's the only way I know about certain characters. I'm like, yeah, are you

746
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:35,200
going to come in? No, end of the day. Okay, we have 225, so I'm going to order the smelly stuff. I

747
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:41,680
don't know what it is. It just says cleansing. Oh wait, I didn't order it. I put it in my car,

748
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:49,280
but I didn't order it. The werewolves from chainsaw man. Sure, I'll just put it here.

749
01:31:50,800 --> 01:32:01,680
Oh my god, that's so satisfying. Okay, let's make some profit on these bad boys. 16A, let's

750
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:07,680
undercut the market. Yeah, we make $8.00, $7.00. Everything we make good profit on,

751
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:12,320
I just need people to come flying in and do it more. I am sold. Yeah, only $21.00.

752
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:17,680
Played at worse. Revenue income, profit.

753
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:26,720
I am card earnings. Yeah, well, I don't really sell cards because I wanted to collect them myself,

754
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:34,000
but I need to make money in order to keep going. Right, this looks like all the little stuff going.

755
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:40,400
Mommy, are we wimps? Wimpling? Only when I scare you.

756
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:45,200
Stoney has the perfect assets. Where am I cute? Cosely.

757
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:54,000
She's the red-haired girl in the business attire. Yeah, yeah, I know her.

758
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:01,920
Yeah, I'm familiar with her work. Yeah. Okay, hydration check. That's right. I'm

759
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:06,240
remembered to tell you at Hydra. What the fuck? It's already been an hour 30.

760
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:20,160
Have I yapped for an hour 30 already? Oh my god. Time flies when you get to yap about the things you love.

761
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:25,600
I almost charged you a dollar for that. I almost got myself in trouble there.

762
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:33,280
Geez. I don't know how I do that, honestly. I be time traveling when I stream. I don't know

763
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:39,920
about you, but I be time traveling. Okay, thank you very much. I would like to give you this, please.

764
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:47,440
My water out. Oh yeah, your water out. Her work. Oh yes, I'm working, wink, wink.

765
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,080
I'm working. Whoa, we made 50. Oh my god, this place stinks.

766
01:33:54,960 --> 01:34:01,760
Where? I don't see how to clean stuff up. We made 50 on these though. Hold on a minute.

767
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,760
I guess the more expensive the item, the more profit to be made.

768
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,680
Did we do another dice then? I don't have enough though. Maybe.

769
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:21,920
I'm going to get, I'm going to get one of these. Oh my goodness. Hold on. I'm going to get one of

770
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:31,120
these because, oh, there's more. I didn't even, oh, oh, bad. Oh, sorry. I just walked into that.

771
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,640
I'm embarrassing that customer. Sorry.

772
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:41,360
Take a can and use it. Huh? This?

773
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:53,200
Raffelin. Raffelin, you need to shower more. Don't come to my shop stinky.

774
01:34:54,480 --> 01:35:00,560
Do you understand? That's right. Look down in shame. Don't come in stinky. Wait, I sell the

775
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:07,440
product again? But it's a used product. Don't I have to put it in the bin?

776
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:15,040
No, don't say you're pheromone max and naughty boy. Only amelie to pheromone max.

777
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:24,560
You can solely use cans at full price. That doesn't seem, that seems disingenuous.

778
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:40,080
Oh my, no, I'm typing it down. Fuck you. I'm typing it down. Girlfriend forces you to stop

779
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:46,080
pheromone maxing ASMR and I'm just like violently scrubbing you. Bubble sounds. I've literally

780
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:51,440
wrote that in my notes. Get fucked. My ASMR idea now. Get fucked. Copyright of strong calls

781
01:35:51,520 --> 01:36:00,400
at velour. Gen one indulge. Subscribe to my gen mates. Actually, I'm making that. I don't care.

782
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:05,920
I'm making that. I'm going to get a commission artwork of me looking angry with a fucking soap

783
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:12,480
in one hand and a scrub in the other. Girlfriend ends your pheromone max streak real. The power

784
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:20,320
of Febreze compels you. Honestly. No, I'm making that. See, this is this stuff. This is what I mean.

785
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:28,560
This is what gives me life when I'm like when I'm mucking about we is and we come up with memes

786
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:35,840
stuff together. When's the sigma ASMR? Sigma affirmations. I don't know enough about that meme type.

787
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:44,000
Bye. Whenever I think of sigma, I think of a vermin type too now. Bye sigma. I am compelled.

788
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:52,720
A great idea. A sigma ASMR rule play would go hard. Wait, what is it though? Hold on.

789
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,240
I'm just going to type in sigma brain rot memes. Sigma brain rot memes and see what happens.

790
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,960
Um, what the sigma?

791
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:10,320
What's up my 11 year old skibbity riz, brother? Am I right? We actually don't talk like that,

792
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:19,360
this is brain rot. What? What was this? Did I just repeat what the sigma over and over again

793
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:26,880
in the ear? Is that what you want? I can do that tomorrow. I just repeat what the sigma.

794
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,440
But I do it like in different ways.

795
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:37,920
You're a beta, I'm a sigma, roar, growl, growl.

796
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:47,360
That's what you want. You want me to go in the mic. You're being so skibbity Ohio right now.

797
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:52,560
You're being such a saucy baka. Then at the end, what is that melody?

798
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,920
The middle card in your hand is triggering me so hard.

799
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:07,840
The middle card? I don't have card. I don't have card. Are you stream delayed? I don't have card

800
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:13,600
in hand. Oh, I'm a vtuber model. Oh, you don't like it? It's the one I'm going to pick. It's like

801
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:20,480
the anime thing where I'm like, I pick a card, any card, any card is your, I'm so sorry. I was

802
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:26,880
like, what in game? I don't see kind. God, we're still to do 100 checkouts.

803
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,080
Can you guys stop playing with each other?

804
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:37,440
Like, no, there's no card. You can see there's no cards at the, okay, this is what I want.

805
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,200
How much? Exact change, $77. I'll take it. Thank you.

806
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:53,760
Wow, so cheap. Okay, so take it all, please. Take it all. Take it all. Thank you, replaying.

807
01:38:53,760 --> 01:39:02,640
Oh, I like you a little mustache. But imagine him with a little taper of faith though.

808
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:13,600
Thank you. Thank you for your business. One, two, three, one, two, all yours. Oh my God,

809
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:18,240
gorgeous business. Thank you. You must be Scottish. Thank you. Or Irish, one of the others.

810
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:24,160
Because you're a ginger. Like, in me.

811
01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:33,680
I can't bite the card. The card isn't my thing. I can't push it down.

812
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:42,480
Hi, strongy. I'm late, but have you had troves of people come in at once and steal your cards

813
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:47,680
and trash in place? That's what happens in real life. What, they steal boosters? I heard that.

814
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:54,720
Oh, I can't remember. I can't remember, but it's like, some places open up.

815
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:03,120
Some places can open up the cards and then make it look like they've not been open.

816
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:13,360
Do you know what I'm on about? Like, it's really bad. I've forgotten the terminology for it. It's

817
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:21,200
not splicing. I can't remember the name of it. All right. This is going to be like a little

818
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:27,280
booster pack shelf. Okay. And then the other one's going to, no, no, sorry. That's a major booster

819
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,360
pack. This one's going to be the booster pack shelf. So I'm going to fill it up. I just want it

820
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:36,960
to look more full than it is. Okay. And then this will be all Busturi Worstries. And then the next

821
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:42,560
one will be all Dacey Wacies. Like this one will be all the Dacey Wacies. And then, I guess,

822
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:49,600
smelly stuff and something else. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. It's a bit of a tight squeeze in the

823
01:40:49,600 --> 01:41:00,480
shop, is it? I'll expand soon. I promise I will. I'll expand soon. 47. Right. One, two, one,

824
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:07,200
one, one. Sorry. I cannot do maths out loud. So I have to like basically just say one over and over

825
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:16,400
again. Thank you very much. Here's your two dollars and 60 cent change. Thank you for your

826
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:24,400
produce. Your produce? Yeah. Your support of my business. Right. We'll get more smelly can.

827
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:31,200
Maybe this will just be a smelly can rack. Yeah. There's like so many dice though.

828
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:40,480
Fine. We'll get one of these. No, I'm too poor. Okay. I can't afford it. I tried. I tried. I tried.

829
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:48,240
But we'll make this accessible. Big boxes. And then these are individual booster packs.

830
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:54,800
And then the dice. I guess they're coded to check out the cards. And maybe that's why we're not

831
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:02,240
getting as much sales. But I want to like genuinely try and get all the cards. I don't want to sell

832
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:12,640
my collection. Like no, I like it. Like look how cool these are. You have like some reverse

833
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:22,880
hollows and shinies and stuff. I don't want that. I'll just, sorry. Let's not play in the dark.

834
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:30,320
How does it not just come on automatically? Do a pack opening live? Well, I want to do a Pokemon

835
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:39,440
pack opening and putting it away in like the sleeves and stuff. I need to order. Stop. Enough

836
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:49,040
with the brain rot. I need to purchase the book thing that it goes in. You know how there's like

837
01:42:49,120 --> 01:43:01,600
sleeved book decks to protect it? I know. I know. I want to do it. So then we'll open all the cards

838
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:07,600
and then we'll numeric them. So we put them in the right section in the book as well. I think that

839
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,640
would be really nice. It would be a very long hand cam stream though. And I'd need to definitely

840
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:22,240
make sure you can see what I see because when I did the pop and cooking stream, I did all right

841
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:30,080
trying to keep most of it in frame. But it's really difficult because I can't see what you see. I'm

842
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:35,200
looking down and I'm not looking up at the monitor type thing because I was on the floor during that

843
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:40,480
stream. And if we do a Pokemon pack opening, I think we'd probably be on the floor again.

844
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:48,560
Make sure the pages do not reflect your face though. Oh no. You're gonna see what I really

845
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:54,480
look like. Oh no. Oh, it's getting late. I don't know if someone's gonna be able to play with you.

846
01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:02,160
Right. Stop pheromone maxing this poor lady. No, no, don't move it. Sorry. I mean, take this.

847
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:08,640
Take this. Take this. Relate. There you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're gonna batter it away,

848
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:14,080
but you know I'm right. You're well. I'm doing you a favor. I'm doing you a favor. Okay.

849
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,680
A stinkling? Oh, that's so cute. Are you my little stinkling?

850
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:26,400
Danny, give you a wishy-washy in the bathtub. There's more me need to scrub you all over.

851
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:35,360
Refresher's doing work. Okay, wear a balaclava and strap a GoPro to your forehead then.

852
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:42,480
What? What was that response to? You could probably put tape around the area that your camera can't see.

853
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:53,440
Imagine wearing a balaclava of recling. No. By the way, Momay, you did something to

854
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,800
blow my mind to my brain every time you hear someone say Fortnite and I whisper, Fortnite,

855
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:04,080
soon. You're gonna know why it's been stuck in my head. I mean, I've already leaked to that. I'm

856
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:09,120
pretty sure Amy's already spoken about it as well. Girlfriend ties you up and cures your brain raw

857
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:18,320
ASMR. Lobot me. You guys are on fire today. What the fuck? What the fuck? You guys are on fire.

858
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:23,040
I've literally just straight copied and pasted that in a minute. Fuck you. My idea now. I'm

859
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:30,720
profiting off of your hard work. You guys are on fire. I don't know what's going on. I want

860
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:37,040
Lobot me ASMR. You're getting it. I'm going to do all the brain mashing sounds. I have an idea on

861
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:46,320
how to make them. How can Strony cure your brain raw? She caused it. How dare you speak the truth

862
01:45:46,320 --> 01:46:00,160
that they hated him for he spoke the truth out loud. Girlfriend ties you up and gives you brain

863
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:07,120
raw and then afterwards it's like it backfired. This isn't skibbity. I'm so sorry Reefling but

864
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:18,960
I know what I have to do. This isn't skibbity. Okay, I can finally afford a new dice set. Hello

865
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:28,080
little package. Are you squinting right now? No, I would never beat you. Mama beats the piss

866
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:35,360
out of you. No, I don't beat you. I love you. You're my little baby. Let's undercut the market.

867
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:43,600
Okay, we make seven on that. We make seven on that. Yeah. Five on you. 90. Okay, the price

868
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:50,240
seems to fluctuate. Let's just say we do make good profit on whatever people do buy. It's just

869
01:46:51,200 --> 01:47:07,920
not to be confused with Dubai. I'm not beating Reefling. The only version of beating you I'll do.

870
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:15,920
You know those funny video ASMR memes that are beating you unconscious? I would do that.

871
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:26,080
Oh, I forgot to order the microphone for my stomach sounds ASMR. Hold on. I need to write that

872
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:33,040
in my notes. Fucking hell, I have more notes in one day than I've had in weeks. Headphone make order

873
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:40,560
now because I said I was going to do that ages ago. As I said, I do like eventually get around to

874
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:48,400
doing what I need to do. It's just because it takes time. I want to unlock the figures before I go.

875
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:59,280
A red deck. I'm wondering if we just skip to a red deck.

876
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:09,200
So we've got two variations of dice because if I got more dice I would actually need another shelf.

877
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:15,680
You know that. This is tempting.

878
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:24,560
Girlfriend buys your favorite packs for $100 a month. No, you didn't like the dice. I'm sorry.

879
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:31,120
I thought you would have went for it. Okay, no change. Thank you. I feel like 33. Not bad. I'll take it.

880
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:39,040
I just need you to... I'm needing you to, you know, start. This is tempting, yeah.

881
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:47,360
No, stop. Danny packs this away. I will. Can I like sell you? Box up. Right, and then place it down.

882
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,400
I like... I don't want to sell the cards. I want them for myself.

883
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:59,520
I'll sell duplicates, but if the duplicates are like literally $0.10, I'm not...

884
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:07,280
I'm not giving... I suppose once they're priced, actually. You know what? Don't be...

885
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:15,440
Don't be lazy. You run a card shop. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry for being lazy sometimes. I just...

886
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:23,760
Oh, you know. I don't want to open up packs either. Like, I want to invest. I want to invest in my junk.

887
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:31,360
Right, we're going to try you. What are you? The hose is going to love this. It's me on the hose.

888
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:40,000
Chicky tablet screen? What? Screen? What does this mean?

889
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,680
Right.

890
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:54,400
Tablet? Winkwink 9000? Tablet screen? Do you mean like brainwalt? Like a... 18...

891
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:58,240
No, no. Yeah. Only four quid profit?

892
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,760
That's worse than the cans.

893
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:09,360
This is worse than the cans.

894
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,920
Bro, I'm going to just put my stocks into the cans. How is that so bad?

895
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:22,640
I don't want to upsell. No, I like being under market value. I want people to shop

896
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:27,600
independent and when they realize that corporations and all that are bad...

897
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:35,600
Oh, this changed in price. No, I don't want to have to adjust it every day as well. I'm lazy.

898
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:42,720
I noticed that in supermarket simulator, it like notified you what items went up and down in price

899
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:48,160
and I'm like, ah, I'm too lazy to like constantly change it. I'd rather just undersell. I'm sure

900
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:53,840
that's probably what I'm doing wrong. I'm sure everyone's like going above like the recommended

901
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:59,200
market price or something and then then here's me like, I just can't seem to get enough money to

902
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:05,040
invest. What's going on? A reef link here. I don't know.

903
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:11,840
Scrolling for five hours. So it's just silent breathing. Almost $20,000. There's an only making

904
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:17,200
four profit. Girlfriend whispers subliminal messages in your ear while you sleep and make

905
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:28,080
you addicted to her ASMR. Oh, that's a cute one. I'm not sure. I really like plots where you're shy

906
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:34,960
to introduce that you like ASMR, but then like, I would be super accepting and like, oh, come on then,

907
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,720
let's have a fun night together type. Fuck it. I'm writing that down as well. Fuck it. Fuck you,

908
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:46,640
bitch. I'm writing it down. Okay, reef link confesses he likes ASMR. Instead of rejection,

909
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:54,240
I'm super duper awesome and accepting and then plan one hour ASMR

910
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:03,920
pampering session and then by the end, I ask how I've done and you're asleep. So we cuddle and

911
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:15,600
sleep together and I give a forehead kiss and then there's a soft breathing section at the end to

912
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:22,880
sleep to me. Well I sleep with you. That's really cute. I like that. Okay, we're going to do that.

913
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:29,600
That'll be my first like proper strong collapse with the lure and it definitely isn't her just

914
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:36,960
mimicking the other girls while she gas lights you into thinking it's not just no, I cannot. I can't

915
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:43,040
do like I actually really hurts to do my Azura mimic actually really hurts.

916
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:51,680
Um, it's not anything to do or hurt just, well obviously my voice is a bit sore after my chaos

917
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:58,560
that ensued and the thingy and yesterday's stream. Um, it actually really hurts to mimic a voice.

918
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:06,160
Um, like my wee voice box just can't, can't handle it, you know, right? No, come. Yes. And then

919
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:11,920
what the sigma? Let's just spread them out a little bit.

920
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:24,800
I have an odd one out. That's okay. Right, speaking us to get you. Come. No. You. Take. Our. Spray.

921
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,440
Put it back and pretend like we never used that.

922
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:36,720
He he he. That must be one. I love pampering and checking after care. I want to be loved.

923
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:42,640
That's good. Yeah. I like it. It's a thing of someone holding a tablet at their waist in

924
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:51,680
bed with the tubers face on screen. Monka. Oh my God. I think I know what you're talking about.

925
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:57,680
That trend. I know what you're talking about. The rambling ASMR last night and while I couldn't

926
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:03,680
fall asleep to it, I did find myself zoning out as if I was going in and out. There was

927
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:08,960
something hypnotic about the fast rambling in one ear and the random tacks moving around.

928
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:15,680
Oh, you like that. Thank you, Sleepy Phoenix for the tip. Wink, wink, 9000. I know exactly what

929
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:21,840
you're talking about. Holy moly. Someone did it to pretend to do the gloop, gloop, 9000. And then

930
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:31,120
she had to delete all her content. I know exactly what VTuber asset you're on about.

931
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:36,000
It's like you're POV, you're holding a tablet, like your legs are inframing that,

932
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,000
and I would be on the tablet, but because the face would get cut off possibly.

933
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:49,520
Unless I did like a creepy meta roleplay ASMR where I'm like,

934
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:58,560
I know you're watching me, Riefling. It's okay. And then like, I just realised,

935
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:04,560
why did no one tell me the hand is hanging off of me? You've been...

936
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:11,840
Brett. Is that me? I think I did that. I did not realise my hand was very clearly,

937
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,480
obviously, holding off on the asset like that. You didn't notice? Oh, you just turned it.

938
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:23,280
Are you two into my eyes? Yes, yes you are. You are into my eyes. 35, gone in.

939
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,560
Right, so we've got Smelly Stuff, Booster Packs, Boxes, we're getting a wee bit small.

940
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:35,680
That was a waste of freaking money. The dices are selling, but like,

941
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:42,640
I feel like I'm missing a core mechanic. It must be the cards. I don't want to open and sell cards.

942
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,800
Maybe more dice?

943
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:57,280
What are you? Level 8? I want to try and unlock this book, I assume,

944
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,840
or should we just try and save up for figures?

945
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:08,000
$500 for figures. I mean, if I don't spend anything and just completely sell...

946
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,200
Wait, hold on, what does this say? Open phone.

947
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,800
Renault. Shop expansion.

948
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:20,640
Would that increase the number of customers? Manage event.

949
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:27,280
Strony's Card Emporium. Standard fee.

950
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:35,440
Nearby Store Shurch 10, so we'll charge $8. Random Rarity Pack. Confirm event.

951
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:42,080
Did I do it? Bells!

952
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,320
Bells.

953
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,800
Bells. Okay.

954
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:06,400
Can you open the box? Possibly. Take item.

955
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:13,120
Okay, they don't count. It has to be the booster packs only. I mean, I guess that makes sense,

956
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:20,000
because that's what the fun is. Right, we're gonna save up $500 and we're gonna try and sell plushies.

957
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:27,520
I'm wondering if I had more tables and chairs. Would more customers be assigned to the shop?

958
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:33,920
Oh, decisions. Decisions. We're guessing about how the AI is set up in this thing.

959
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:37,280
Decisions. Decisions.

960
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:42,560
All right, we're gonna sort by amount. Do I have any duplicates?

961
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:53,680
No, I sold them all. Okay, Momie Yandere ASMR. You dox the streamer, so she breaks in and lives with you.

962
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:01,760
Many refling heights. He loves being pampered by Momie. He controls and opens them up.

963
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:08,560
Oh, I'll open you up on it. Sorry. Sorry. Ed stop. Let me pop the lights on,

964
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:11,040
because we're still playing. Can't even read the name of the cards.

965
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:20,720
Girlfriend comforts you after a thing, after a scary movie. ASMR roleplay,

966
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:27,040
comforting your stalker, looking through your webcam. Comforting your stalker? No, your stalker

967
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:31,040
comforts you. I would have to be your stalker. No, I'll open you up. I mean, what?

968
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:38,480
Bro, that's literally me. I'm like, yeah, after I'm done, you how? More tables and chairs would get

969
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:46,080
more pays per hour. It is. Okay, we're learning the AI. Okay, how much is the table and chair?

970
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:49,600
I think it's like 30, 300 though. No, wrong one. Sorry, that one.

971
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:56,160
That's fucking blinding. I just want you to know my eyes didn't even know.

972
01:58:56,160 --> 01:59:05,840
Right, so we're gonna get more folk in. I mean, definitely. Oh, no, I wanted the plushie. Oh,

973
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:14,160
I've already forgot. I want $500 for the plushie. Look, we're gonna expand the shop soon. I promise,

974
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:19,520
we're gonna expand the shop soon. I need, I just want $500 so I can get the plushie. I just want

975
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:28,000
to see the plushie. We got $30 just from them sitting playing games. Are they tipping? Is that

976
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,160
what you do in cart? I've never played in a card shop before. Do you tip for being there? I thought

977
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:41,520
like when you buy card packs or when you buy food items, like I assume they have dry snacks there.

978
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:48,240
Boss teases you while at work ASMR. I don't think that's for YouTube if I'm writing that one.

979
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:53,680
They pay $8 for playing. Oh, did I do the event?

980
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:02,640
Current game event. Is it on? I'll find out when it's shot. When it closes.

981
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:10,880
Yeah, little dice set. Good choice. $1.50, sir. I'm gonna keep it a Costco hotdog.

982
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:16,160
They probably have gamer subs there. Yeah, you need, where's my gamer subs? I don't see it.

983
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:23,040
Use code SRANI for 10% out. All right, anyone. There is a new flavor, new

984
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:32,800
variation of anime thighs and guess who's thighs are on it? Shibis. I keep doing that. I would like

985
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:42,720
to pick up the product and then stop it. You're stinking at this place. Yeah, I got the behind

986
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:48,320
the scenes opportunity. And I was very surprised. I was like, oh, damn, you want to see it? Because

987
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:57,280
we had only just got signed on. And forks agency was like, I have this opportunity. And I'm like,

988
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:01,200
Oh God, whose thighs do I give it to? Because I had to pick it up. Everyone's thighs. And I said,

989
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:08,800
you know, they told me what the packaging was like. And I was like, right, so we need sex. So

990
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:16,880
thighs. And it was between Mercy's thighs and Shibis. But because Shibis has Shabari rope on it.

991
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,040
And I ended up picking her. But obviously, Shibis wasn't tan at that point. I'm going to let them

992
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:30,160
finish playing because I'll get money for it. But kinklings rise up. Gotta let them know use code

993
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:38,560
SRANI. Yes, this is before Sheepsters was tan. It takes a while for that line of production

994
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,160
stuff to come through like that. Obviously, I don't know anything about it. But that stuff

995
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:46,160
that you got to do a couple of months in advance. So Sheepsters wasn't tan yet.

996
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:56,080
But yeah, because she had the Shabari ropes on her legs, I picked her. It was between her and

997
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:09,520
Mercy. And the song design on Mercy was too much to ask for. Obviously, I didn't put myself forward

998
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:16,560
because, you know, I want the girls to have the opportunity, not me. But no, Gamersops have

999
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:23,520
been fantastic. I need to message them because I've got a PR package from them and all that.

1000
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:26,640
I'm just going to ask them, you know, how much am I allowed to say in there? Oh,

1001
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:32,800
he's done. He's buying anything or he's gone home? Not he's gone home, right? I'm so sorry,

1002
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:39,600
but no one's available to play. I can't play either. Right, we've got a new table. So

1003
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:47,680
total visits 15. Keep that in mind. 15 is the magic number. We're bought a new table. So

1004
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:56,480
if all of a sudden we start getting thingy, Azur's thighs wouldn't fit. No, it had to be

1005
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:06,080
Azur, although Azur's, everyone's, no, don't get it twisted. Everyone's is gorgeous, lovely

1006
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:15,360
10 out of 10 design, all of that. It just, someone had to be picked. And it was between either

1007
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:21,520
Mercer or Shibi. And Shibi got it because of the Shibari ropes, just due to the nature of the

1008
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:26,080
design. Like, it's just how it went. Stop looking at the cards. I'm not saying, stop shaking your

1009
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:32,000
head at it. You can see it's empty. I'm not selling cards. I want to collect them myself,

1010
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:37,120
you fannies. Honestly, like, did I need to rip packs open and just sell the duplicates?

1011
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:42,160
I don't even think I'm going to make a profit that way. I need someone to man the till.

1012
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:47,040
But I can't hire a reflin yet. How did I make 16 bucks on 110?

1013
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:51,440
They want to buy cards. Oh, I'm going to have to rip cards open.

1014
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:57,120
Strony and Dairy Hacks, your speaker system and toxies are electronic, so you sleep to get

1015
02:03:57,120 --> 02:04:04,800
Stockholm Syndrome. You want me, you want more of me, you need me. And she like,

1016
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:08,720
literally, she's like, distinctly, one distinct please. I'm like, uh, sure.

1017
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:13,440
Sure. Just buy one box for yourself. I think I'm going to have to, literally,

1018
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,360
they're getting a sign to buy cards. I think that's what the problem is. That's what the,

1019
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:21,200
the hold up, what's the whole, whoa, no, that's a big overcharge.

1020
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:27,360
Point eight. You can like, type it on the number pad. I'm pretty happy with that.

1021
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:33,680
A dollar, 50. Right, that's it. We're doing it. I don't care if everyone's going to be

1022
02:04:34,640 --> 02:04:41,360
staring at me. I'm going to be opening them right in front of everyone. Right, let's go.

1023
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:49,440
Let's go. Okay. Hit him with a new one. Hit him with a, ooh, ooh.

1024
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:56,240
Why are we getting like, so many, sounds like a Lillipop, that one actually. It looks like

1025
02:04:56,320 --> 02:05:03,600
Lillipop and Lucari put together. Oh my God, that's exactly what the, looking thing is.

1026
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:07,920
Are we baby? Are we star? What's a star?

1027
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:19,200
Is that Houdini's eyes mixed with the legendary feral bird? It's not feral. It's the other one.

1028
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:27,440
These are fucking fucking mashed together. I, I find it hard to, I don't know. I don't know about

1029
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:32,080
you chief. Like that was supposed to, the last one was supposed to be the orange fish that only

1030
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:41,040
knows splash. I'm going to sneeze. No, that's literally, like it's that bear that has the

1031
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:49,280
circle on its belly and then Azuba. Like, come on. Am I, am I going mental? I can't even,

1032
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:57,120
well I could be going mental, but Magikarp, that's him. Guppy. Oh my God, we got one of three for

1033
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:06,640
Guppy. Yay, we can fly soon. That's a reference to the hit video game. Yeah, it's like telling me

1034
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:12,000
the cards total are like more than the base price of the packet, but I don't know.

1035
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:19,200
I'm not getting anything. If there's like a billion cut, I'll need to open up the thing

1036
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:25,760
you can see how many cards there are, but like, I ain't getting any cut. These are the same over

1037
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:33,760
and over again. It must be because it's the, it's not the full game on launch. Oh, we got a shiny

1038
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:42,240
sapling. Your new Tetron, I don't know what you're based after. But yeah, I'm so sorry,

1039
02:06:42,240 --> 02:06:46,080
that customer just staring me in the background whilst I'm like holding up the cards physically,

1040
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:54,240
like like two centimeters away from her face. Nimbless. Yeah, like, how is that new? I've seen

1041
02:06:54,240 --> 02:07:01,360
that. It must be variations, like shinies and reverse hollows and all that jazz and backflips

1042
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:10,160
in 360s. And thank you for waiting. Thank you for just thanking yourself.

1043
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:18,480
It's a variant with better skills. She's getting our free show.

1044
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,720
Well, my girlfriend, Pamper June forces you to take your meds, but she disappears. Oh,

1045
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:30,800
no, that's so sad. I feel like that's a mean one. I don't want to actually, I don't want to make one

1046
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:42,320
that could be interpreted as mean when I'm, I don't, whoa. Wait, what? Right, give me that.

1047
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:50,960
And close album. Yeah, since you're all crying about how I've never sellin' cards,

1048
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:58,240
I don't know why everyone's so interested in these like, we shake cards, but sure, knock yourself out.

1049
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:07,120
I don't know, like, literally the rubbish. Oh my god, can you pheromone max somewhere else, please?

1050
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:12,160
I'm trying so hard right now to put the shop together. And the first thing you do is come

1051
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:19,280
right next to me. Stink up the joint. Right. I don't know, maybe I can put a higher premium on

1052
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:26,640
cards because they're like supposed to be like, that's what they do when you're missing a card,

1053
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:33,440
right? You like, go to a shop that sells that individual card. Oh, I'm like, some profit,

1054
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:39,280
60 for contents. Like, I'll just put a premium on them. If people start complaining, like,

1055
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:44,560
bro, that's on you. I don't know why you want to buy single. Yeah, I'm making money when they

1056
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:51,360
sit down. Right, we're almost at 500. Do not buy anything. I must only buy. Oh my god,

1057
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:55,600
she be sick and is doing a nap with your six girlfriend to our space? Is she gonna fart?

1058
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:03,520
Is she gonna toot? You don't understand. I hope she feels well soon. Yeah,

1059
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:09,760
due to her sheepster, she's even struggling. We're getting AC sick as well. Emmy was sick.

1060
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:17,680
I think she's still sick. Mercy was sick the other day. Oh my gosh. Everyone's dying. Right,

1061
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:24,240
no, don't stink up the joint. You already know. You already know. Give me that. Stop it.

1062
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:32,240
Stop pheromone maxing. Get out of here. All the girls are sick. Literally,

1063
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:37,280
everyone's getting sick. Is that real? Do you have to pay to play cards at a card shop? I don't

1064
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:43,920
think so. I thought you kind of like paid by, yeah, really breaking the bank there. Like,

1065
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:50,080
nine fucking pens. Do I just need to roll a double of like a card that's valuable, maybe?

1066
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:57,920
It must be because like, bro. We ain't making much profits with this one. That's all I'm saying.

1067
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:07,520
A whole dollar. I don't know. It depends on the shop. Also, your shop has an event going on.

1068
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:13,920
Does it constantly just keep rolling? Bro, I want...

1069
02:10:23,120 --> 02:10:27,200
I want the plushie. I'm not paying my bills. I want the plushie. Sorry.

1070
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:33,600
Give me the plushie. I'mma just watch them play. I want the plushie. That's all I want. That's all

1071
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:37,520
I ask for. It's the ability to buy the plushies and sell them. Where are they?

1072
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:44,640
Level six required, so we're gonna get it. Yeah, I just need people to pay a few more things.

1073
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:50,240
MTG often have draft events. Thought just a lot of the issues of people coming in with

1074
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:56,320
$1,000 decks and being unbeatable. You can... Wait, I thought the whole point of like that

1075
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,560
kind of stuff is you can't like pay to win.

1076
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:06,880
Did they do like exclusive cards that only a limited set amount of people can have access to?

1077
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:15,760
That can't be right. That doesn't sound right. No plushies until the bills are paid. No, plushies first.

1078
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:22,000
Look, I'm a girl, okay? Scottish bully pins you against the wall with your wrist above your head

1079
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:28,320
and kisses you. If only YouTube allowed it, I would do that, but YouTube has been so freaky.

1080
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:43,440
Bonnie from Globy got a warning on her ASMR. Yeah, YouTube just do not f-ing like ASMR at all

1081
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:50,160
at the minute and they're just no saying a thing. Sorry. I know I keep repeating myself.

1082
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:56,160
It's just really frustrating. It's a frustrating topic, okay? I want to do all these fun plots.

1083
02:11:56,160 --> 02:12:01,920
I want to do all these outrageous things. For talking about tea, she posted the clip.

1084
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:08,240
They flagged her for... Yeah, every timestamp is like something ridiculous. The AI is no having it.

1085
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:19,040
The AI is not having it. I do not know why. As I said, obviously, Amy got done for rat sniffing

1086
02:12:19,040 --> 02:12:26,320
the mic and you know what they say when YouTube are like, and we take into consideration all the

1087
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:30,160
content on the channel and they're like, you're telling me, Amy's sitting and playing five nights

1088
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:37,840
at Freddy's and it's like... Oh, that's like, you're sick and I look after you and I'd be like,

1089
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:41,440
and then you hear like chopping in the background because I'm chopping up the veggies,

1090
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:46,080
but like you're fading in and out of sleep because you don't feel well. The way that stood erect,

1091
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:52,400
that was impressive. Like you're fading in and out of sleep and I like put little notes on the screen

1092
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:58,160
and it's like, oh, you're... Please don't... I thought she's going to do what I think she's going to do.

1093
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:07,040
Stap it. Stop it. Yeah, I'm targeting you specifically. I think start cleaning.

1094
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,920
Thank you, CrazyJC, for the super chat. That would be really sweet and

1095
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:20,560
beaten YouTube to ask this somewhere. What is your opinion on emotionally some of our strong

1096
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:25,040
emotions like sadness that are happy about like getting saved or saving an accident? Oh,

1097
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:33,520
I get wary of touching anything that's too real or maybe too deep because

1098
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:41,520
I just like to focus on like the fun, the happy, the meanie, or you get something out of it type

1099
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:47,040
stuff. Oh my god, I'm like four dollars away from the plushies. I get nervous about actually touching

1100
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:55,040
hard-hitting subjects because I just fear that like someone might take it the wrong way or think

1101
02:13:55,040 --> 02:14:00,720
I'm making fun of it because it's like, if I did a super serious video and then they subscribe and

1102
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:06,560
they click on my channel, what did they see? Pregnancy ASMR. And they're going to be like,

1103
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:09,840
oh my god, this person's just like taking the piss and they're like, no, I'm just,

1104
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:11,920
I'm just like being super duper serious.

1105
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,280
Right, we'll go... Give me it. Give...

1106
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:27,120
I'm not level six yet. Okay, so what do I do instead?

1107
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:29,840
If I'm not level six,

1108
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:39,760
I don't want to pay my bills. I don't want to pay my bills.

1109
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:43,200
You could also record the sounds from actually cooking you soup.

1110
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:51,840
I was going to do my sweaty feet on kitchen floor tiles ASMR because like mine go like...

1111
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:57,520
Because I got sweaty feet. Did I mention I'm sweaty feet at any point?

1112
02:14:57,520 --> 02:14:59,680
Did I mention them? Yeah, you know that that, yeah.

1113
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,960
Right, so I can't get any more from that.

1114
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:08,640
I can get more cleanser. I might as well... Oh my god.

1115
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:19,920
I mean, what's that? 500? Right, I'll buy all of that. Oh, well, there you go. I just popped.

1116
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:21,360
It just popped.

1117
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:30,240
Why not? Let's see what I'm looking at. Right, booster packs. Let's get them all up.

1118
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:32,800
Foot bro's winning question mark.

1119
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,720
Mommy, I'm so sleepy. Thank you for today's stream.

1120
02:15:34,720 --> 02:15:39,920
He's gonna keep... Yeah, this is just a very casual and relaxed kind of day.

1121
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:47,360
We're taking it easy. Why? No, I don't want to randomly take out that in the middle of this.

1122
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:54,080
The box has no items. Oh, that was a perfect resource then.

1123
02:15:56,240 --> 02:16:00,240
Yeah, no. Today, very casual and easy and EP. I'm going to be...

1124
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:10,720
Wait, I guess I'm gonna have to put them here? Oh, fine. Well, then give me that then.

1125
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:19,280
Yeah, we're just taking it easy because I don't know what tomorrow's stream is though.

1126
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:26,240
What was that master quote from that one kung fu panda?

1127
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:33,120
Tomorrow's a mystery. Today is a present because it's a gift or something like that.

1128
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:41,920
Wait, so that's $10 profits. In theory, the higher price, like the higher tier is better,

1129
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:53,360
but I'll let them finish playing. Get a better shop, literally. I don't know, maybe extend...

1130
02:16:53,360 --> 02:16:58,720
I'm gonna expand it. That's what I'll do next. I'll expand the shop size and put more tables down.

1131
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:03,760
How about that? That seems logically what we're supposed to do next.

1132
02:17:04,880 --> 02:17:10,080
Cult of the Lamb. It wasn't tomorrow given the reflands no gamertag. No, everything's

1133
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:21,280
being shifted around. I'm having a particularly hard thing right now. I'm shuffling things around.

1134
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:25,760
I think Cult of the Lamb's getting swapped out. The membership streams are getting delayed as well.

1135
02:17:27,600 --> 02:17:32,080
Tomorrow is a mystery. Yesterday is history, but today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.

1136
02:17:32,960 --> 02:17:34,800
That's the other god you remembered.

1137
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:45,120
You understood the reference I was making. So I have my random seven board up right now

1138
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:52,960
for all the things. Master Oogly. Sorry, my... I wouldn't have. I have Viral's Curse, Fortnite,

1139
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:54,320
Chug Jog. I have the cough.

1140
02:17:59,440 --> 02:18:03,120
Reflings when I tell them that I want to spawn the high table.

1141
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:11,840
Oh no, reflings when they realise I wasn't joking about taking down the high table.

1142
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:20,960
Horses are gonna fix the economy. Trust. Trust. Have faith. If I ever win the lottery,

1143
02:18:20,960 --> 02:18:23,760
just know that I ain't depressed and I'm never gonna kill myself.

1144
02:18:25,040 --> 02:18:26,160
Okay, day eight.

1145
02:18:28,400 --> 02:18:32,080
Does any pay am I late for rent? Is the shop gonna expire?

1146
02:18:34,400 --> 02:18:41,520
The rent... I owe 421 bucks. No.

1147
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:48,720
Each day on light usage in the shop. So what, just leave it off?

1148
02:18:49,680 --> 02:18:54,480
I can't even hire you yet. I don't have much experience but I'm willing to learn and do

1149
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:59,920
anything. Oh, you are a reflin. Please hire me because I need the money to pay for art school.

1150
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:09,440
You're creative? You are creative. Did you come up with ASMRs and tell me what to do?

1151
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:14,480
Two bucks for this. It's fair, isn't it not astoundingly good? Yeah.

1152
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:24,080
Right, we're gonna expand. I don't know what's gonna happen when we need to pay rent but I'm gonna

1153
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:30,480
just pretend we don't. We're gonna expand and then surely we're gonna get tons of more customers

1154
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:36,720
frequently because I don't get it. I don't get it. Obviously this isn't the finished version of the

1155
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:46,240
game as well. It comes out next. Is it November it comes? I think so. It comes out in November.

1156
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:54,320
It's when it comes out so good. I'm absolutely sorry. I keep typing to get the fucking change.

1157
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:59,760
You didn't hear that? Have you heard that on my keyboard? No, you didn't. I typed in the change to

1158
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:09,120
give. A stinkling spotted? Okay. You only have depression and female illness because with nurse

1159
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:17,920
you'd be taken over the world. I don't have depression. I got the other one. I got the A bomb

1160
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:24,640
but we don't say we don't say we have A bomb. Okay, the stinkling has been fixed.

1161
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:34,160
You look stinky. I can fix that. You look like an honorable card player.

1162
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:41,040
Oh no, you look like an honest card player. I fixed it.

1163
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:52,240
As the hours pass I will let you know that I need to look for me for I'm alone.

1164
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:55,040
Wait, I'm saying the lyrics wrong.

1165
02:21:13,440 --> 02:21:21,280
I finally listened to that album by Mr. Kitty the other day when I was all up in my feels and I

1166
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:27,040
was like no, that was definitely the best banger from it. Girlfriend begs for forgiveness after

1167
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:32,160
gambling. Your belongings a smart car go by in the background because you're on the street.

1168
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:37,760
No, don't start singing the song that video instead. All right, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,

1169
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:40,880
sorry, sorry. Happy song. Happy, happy, happy.

1170
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:49,760
We feeling asleep deprived so mummy cuddles and whispers to him until he sleeps. Oh, it's cute.

1171
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:55,840
I like drag you away from work and because you're so sleep deprived that's cute. I'm copying

1172
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:00,960
that as well. That's a really sweet plot. God, there's so many notes today. Do I know how many

1173
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:11,920
notes that the last notes I had were from seven days ago and today I have one, two, three, four,

1174
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:20,720
five, six, seven, eight notes today alone. You guys are on fire. I don't know what you snorted.

1175
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:23,360
Was it my game or something?

1176
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:32,720
But yeah, I love sad music. I need to be careful if I listen to sad music because I can make myself

1177
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:37,840
sad, listen to it. But if I'm already sad while I listen to it, I'll just cry when I listen.

1178
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:45,680
Like I was crying listening to the Mr. Kitty album and I was like, yes, I feel very...

1179
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:51,040
Like what's the word when you get it out your system? Like that. That's what I felt like I was

1180
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:58,160
getting. Right, we're going to open up the shop. How big is a kid? What the fuck is...

1181
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,680
Are you trolling me?

1182
02:23:04,400 --> 02:23:05,040
A cube.

1183
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:16,560
$300 for a cube expansion. I've got bills to pay. Are you trolling?

1184
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:26,080
A cube? Thank goodness I didn't put my stonks into a...

1185
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:45,040
I mean, I guess I'll work with a Leo, but seriously. Oh my god, I can't even fit.

1186
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:53,840
What? Well, I put the thing here instead.

1187
02:23:58,560 --> 02:23:59,280
Is that it?

1188
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:03,840
I'm being trolled.

1189
02:24:07,440 --> 02:24:12,880
$300 per square foot? I literally have never been played so hard. What?

1190
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:15,840
What? No, don't look at that.

1191
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:23,920
Oh my god, this rotate. Why have you done only rotate one way?

1192
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:28,800
Oh, I can scroll. Oh my god, I can scroll. I don't have to hit R, dammit.

1193
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:33,600
I don't know what to say.

1194
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:40,240
I tried so hard. Not enough change given.

1195
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:42,800
Oh, 19 bucks on top. Sorry.

1196
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:49,440
I'm afraid I might be taking the L on this game.

1197
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:55,920
I mean, we'll probably play again. No, you know what? We'll get the plushie.

1198
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,160
I refuse to get off until I get the plushie.

1199
02:24:59,440 --> 02:25:02,640
Right, we're about to be level six, so we just need... Right, stop buying.

1200
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:08,880
Stop it. Right, I'm level six, so I just need $500 to reduce.

1201
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:15,440
Is there, like, do a mount, right, and then do next page,

1202
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:24,320
and then whatever looks most... A whole $16, $0.16, you shouldn't have.

1203
02:25:24,320 --> 02:25:27,040
No, seriously, you shouldn't have. Knock off.

1204
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:30,560
Right, we're just... Oh, a whole dollar.

1205
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:34,800
Wait, so I have to price it, I guess?

1206
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:38,000
Oh god, the value of these cards is different as well.

1207
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:42,640
I'm not selling my expensive pools either. I want a full deck.

1208
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:48,560
Look, I'm just... I'm just trying my best, okay?

1209
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:51,840
Right, we're doing an upcharge on the cards because these...

1210
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:56,480
These prices are killer. We're doing upcharging.

1211
02:25:56,480 --> 02:26:01,600
You can all be mad that I'm upcharging, but literally I'm making nothing.

1212
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,200
Don't complain or I'll fart on you.

1213
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:10,080
Stop it. I'll make you sniff my armpits after a good game.

1214
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,000
And actually, I never said this yesterday.

1215
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
You know when I went for a pee during the overwatch stream?

1216
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,080
I sat down and got a waft of myself, like, my armpits, and I was like,

1217
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:24,800
Hey, you! I never said it because I was like,

1218
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:26,320
Oh, did anyone know that I'm sinking?

1219
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:29,200
Don't worry, I've had a shower since, but literally I was like,

1220
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:30,560
Oh, is that me? Jeez.

1221
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:34,000
Um, they really stink.

1222
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:35,120
Don't try and answer a good thing.

1223
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:35,680
It'll literally...

1224
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:38,560
Firm on Biomax.

1225
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:40,560
Right, what is this event thing?

1226
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:42,720
I think I need to do... what?

1227
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:45,920
That event?

1228
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:48,320
Confirm event.

1229
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:49,920
Sure, go nuts everyone.

1230
02:26:51,360 --> 02:26:53,120
I think I'm... the phone's only half charged.

1231
02:26:56,320 --> 02:27:00,000
It's due in one day, so does the shop shut down?

1232
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,440
If I try and go for a push?

1233
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:04,320
I'm not turning the lights on.

1234
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:05,600
Sorry, I ain't got the money.

1235
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:10,080
Literally, we seem to have like four or five customers at a time.

1236
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:18,720
Oh, they're more common, but they don't really seem to be going nuts for it, you know?

1237
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:21,520
Oh, I keep taping in to give the...

1238
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:22,960
Stop it.

1239
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:25,040
It's making a mockery of me.

1240
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:28,320
I need 500.

1241
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:31,200
One of my favorite sad songs is Paralyzed by N.F.

1242
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:31,840
I'm not heard of.

1243
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:34,640
Pet Bro's winning so hard right now.

1244
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:36,640
Yeah, I need to start up in my insult game.

1245
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:41,280
It's no longer farting, it's you have to lick my like armpits after a good gaming session.

1246
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:45,520
Go in Mr. Krabbs mode for the plushie.

1247
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:48,480
SpongeBob me, boy.

1248
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:54,000
Soon, Mummy will have her own green aura appropriate.

1249
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:56,560
It's like I'm a ward.

1250
02:27:57,520 --> 02:27:58,560
Strongie, please.

1251
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,520
Well, I keep saying I'm going to fart on your eyelashes.

1252
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:02,880
Need to mix it up a bit, okay?

1253
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:04,800
That's fable, Mummy.

1254
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:05,200
Thank you.

1255
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:07,200
That's what I'm saying.

1256
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:10,400
I need to actually give you something to be fear of, okay?

1257
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:13,280
And a big sweaty, be all lick.

1258
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:16,240
All 9,000 taste buds taken in the aura.

1259
02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:22,160
Taken in the scent, the musk, the pheromones.

1260
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:25,760
Mr. Krabbs is right, SpongeBob me, boy.

1261
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:27,120
Tingle, tingle, tingle.

1262
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:31,120
Every time you tingle me, boy, you'll have to give me a dollar.

1263
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:34,960
Yes, that's how Mr. Krabbs is my friend.

1264
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:39,760
Okay, now you're waiting to play.

1265
02:28:39,760 --> 02:28:40,960
You guys are waiting to play.

1266
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:44,160
Like them so hard they'll be smooth for years.

1267
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:45,360
No, take these back, please.

1268
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:46,960
Don't tease us like that.

1269
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:48,960
Girl's smell is real and reeflings need it.

1270
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:52,960
Yeah, why is, I need to do the reefling,

1271
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:54,800
I need to do the boy smell copy faster,

1272
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:56,640
but I need to edit it so it's like reefling.

1273
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:00,320
Is that your tentacle I smell?

1274
02:29:03,920 --> 02:29:05,600
Reefling, I smell it.

1275
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:06,880
Don't try and hide it from me.

1276
02:29:09,120 --> 02:29:11,600
Yeah, basically I need to do my version of boy smell,

1277
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:12,880
but it's tentacle eyes.

1278
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:18,320
My tentacle always is so hard.

1279
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:22,480
Wow, thank God that didn't go through.

1280
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:23,360
Almost scammed you there.

1281
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:24,720
Sorry, reefling.

1282
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,400
It's like, it's supposed to be the end of my shift.

1283
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:28,960
What's going on?

1284
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:31,280
Okay, that worked.

1285
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,760
Before anyone complains about the lights being off,

1286
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:34,720
look, I'm just trying to get,

1287
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:36,240
I'm just trying to plushy max right now.

1288
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:38,080
I'm halfway there.

1289
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:39,120
Come on.

1290
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:42,080
I know, I know it's hard to read.

1291
02:29:42,080 --> 02:29:44,800
Right, we made $18 off this.

1292
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:48,160
No, see, when the AI does that where they don't kiss,

1293
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:50,880
right, no one complain about the lights.

1294
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:52,320
I know it looks so shady.

1295
02:29:53,440 --> 02:29:56,320
You know you want to come into the back of my shop, okay?

1296
02:29:57,360 --> 02:29:58,160
Yes, you do.

1297
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,480
Yes, look, your window shopping.

1298
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:02,160
Look at the cards that you can get.

1299
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:04,320
And then you peek back

1300
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:06,560
and you see people in the dark playing cards together.

1301
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,400
Yes, you see all the booster packs as well at the top shelf.

1302
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:11,920
Yes, we are opening up.

1303
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:15,680
I'm like sliding across the glass.

1304
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:16,960
All you hear is like,

1305
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:21,040
as I'm sliding across the glass checking out my shop.

1306
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:24,160
Are you gonna sit with that guy?

1307
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:24,640
Nope.

1308
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,320
Nope, you're shaking your head at that.

1309
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:27,120
I don't know why.

1310
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:32,240
You gonna buy a nice $0.20?

1311
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:33,680
Thanks, I really appreciate it.

1312
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,560
In the back of the shop?

1313
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:37,840
Why yes, of course.

1314
02:30:37,840 --> 02:30:39,120
Tried by Mummy in the car shop,

1315
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:39,920
but he's for when?

1316
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:44,800
No, bro, you are glowing.

1317
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:52,080
you are glowing! stop it! there is no way you're glowing that much in my shop

1318
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:57,680
can they even finish the game in the dark? i feel really bad right now that they're having to play

1319
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:04,000
in the dark. he's radioactive. glass squeaking in den of the vise. oh literally glowing.

1320
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:11,840

1321
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:18,240
we have f- this is the first time we've had three tables play at the same time

1322
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:21,360
this will never happen again in history

1323
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:24,960
this will never happen again

1324
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:34,720
can they not- i don't think they can finish if the lights are off you know that

1325
02:31:42,800 --> 02:31:46,160

1326
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,600

it's public right now for everyone

1389
02:35:24,400 --> 02:35:29,440
just in case it's meant for members only it will love you

1390
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:34,560
done and done

1391
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:40,640
wait you talk to the girls like that yes yes we see i love you to each other

1392
02:35:40,640 --> 02:35:43,840
surprise me the girls are very nice to me

1393
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:46,320
and they're like oh i love you and i'm like no i love you

1394
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:54,880
yeah fun little detail that i didn't expect they all call me mummy

1395
02:35:56,320 --> 02:36:02,160
i never expected that um i think shevi was the first one to call me mummy

1396
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:06,960
like mume like a riflin mummy and they all just kind of call me mummy now and i'm like

1397
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,160
i don't know how to feel about this

1398
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:10,720
but it's very cute

1399
02:36:12,640 --> 02:36:14,960
probably can't watch it's five in the morning

1400
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:17,440
hey it's a new model yeah that's what i was thinking

1401
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:23,840
like if your shop increases in level do they spawn new people

1402
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:30,480
three dollars not a very good session they already reached quite and they're out

1403
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:32,160
they're like nine buying none of this stuff

1404
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:36,480
she be yeah how surprising that she calls your mummy too

1405
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:40,320
you've been calling them your daughter since the view it's probably natural

1406
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:48,080
no but they call me mummy like m-u-m-m-e-h that's what probably surprised me when we started

1407
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:52,800
interacting with other v-tubers as they were calling me mummy like that too and i'm like

1408
02:36:53,600 --> 02:37:01,520
how do you know about that i'm like uh how are we how are you doing that

1409
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:10,320
you know because how do you how do you what's going on what's going on here

1410
02:37:14,720 --> 02:37:19,920
how do they know worldwide mummy which i'm like what's going on here how do you know that

1411
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:26,560
i think what it is is maybe for the v-tubers that you know don't know the previous or they

1412
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:32,400
probably don't realize what that i came from there and it's just like why can't i get a

1413
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:38,320
want in the store brah you made the comment so passively that i couldn't even read it in time

1414
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:47,440
and in comes a fair a fair one maxi i need to buy more booster packs actually

1415
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:56,160
i need 200 in order to sell the plushies but i unironically might need to invest in stock before

1416
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,880
it none of change given

1417
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:08,960
what is there what the fuck am i okay you know right that's six day make it six day give it a

1418
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:18,560

female players sir sir please don't please don't stink over the girls that are playing i i get it

1420
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:32,240
i get it it's rare girl card gamer's rare but sir please don't stink over their table

1421
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:40,400
mummy has been officially trademarked by sharoni literally what makes this funnier is you're

1422
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:48,400
probably younger than most i can't see cannot confirm nor deny

1423
02:38:48,400 --> 02:38:51,440
me

1424
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:55,040
to stop it it's literally me oh but i like you watching me

1425
02:38:57,120 --> 02:39:03,200
hi refling yeah you like watching yeah you like watching yeah

1426
02:39:08,400 --> 02:39:12,880
no don't go away from my kisses you don't want more can i crouch in this game

1427
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:16,480
oh i was gonna crouch but i can't crouch

1428
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:30,800
i need 200 stop see this is why i this is why i didn't want to sell cards because it seems like

1429
02:39:30,800 --> 02:39:37,600
such a waste of time he's a shyling i'm going up in them nostrils it's not the only hole i'm going

1430
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:45,440
thank you i was very delayed on that reaction

1431
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:53,040
right uh i guess well

1432
02:39:57,280 --> 02:40:00,720
like i could be making a markup i'm not making a mockery of me

1433
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:06,560
that profit was so small on that average cost is 14

1434
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:13,680
is that what the the bigger box thing is is the bigger box you make more money on the bigger

1435
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:22,160
hold on let me analyze stock order so if i buy two units it's

1436
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:30,800
96.55 right 96.55 it's the exact same

1437
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:40,720
okay so then what's the benefit of buying that thing you'd think you'd get a bit of a better

1438
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:47,520
deal on the bulk and then that's kind of the point in buying bulk i'm giving that fucking

1439
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:54,960
plus i'm shoving it i put it in the cart all right i need 206 dollars me millionth dollar

1440
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:00,560
okay we have six people in

1441
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:07,680
what we'll do we'll buy the plus and then i'll wrap it up maybe

1442
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:15,520
can you come back in the shop and order something excuse me sir sir sir sir

1443
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:21,520
fake clean clearly fake clean yeah but as i said this is like literally supermarket simulator

1444
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:27,360
i i don't know if these are like the the reused assets that you can purchase from

1445
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:35,920
um i don't know if you've ever seen those like behind the scenes game dev stuff where you can

1446
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:41,120
use assets like on unity or these kind of things and and it's not an issue and all that

1447
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:46,000
and i'm sure there was a game that came out that had a load of reused assets and everyone was like

1448
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:52,000
don't support this game but and then i was like no actually that's what assets were for you barely

1449
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:56,800
have six hours left to pay your rent i swear if it's game over because i've not paid attention to

1516
02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:59,280
that is so much money for that i don't know maybe we should try and get one of the youth

1517
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:06,720
the green deck or maybe another table i don't know i don't know

1518

1525
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:57,200
correlate with my last sense i assure you there's no correlation whatsoever no correlation

1532
02:51:55,040 --> 02:52:01,280
i didn't really see it doesn't i think if i was upcharging more sure but i maybe put more tables

1533
02:52:01,280 --> 02:52:11,760
than let's see what you are do you have a better pricing than freaking the red one because the red

1534
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:20,720
one's rubbish the red one gives me four bucks can you at least give me something okay that one gives

1535
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:31,920
me much more money oh my god people are actually buying items the game's speeding up all of a

1536
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:37,760
sudden the game wants to be nice to me get out of here get out of here i already know what

1537
02:52:38,480 --> 02:52:44,080
it's i like how they waft it away as if i'm like not helping them de-stink

1538
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:51,920
so how much is it for another table and cheers then 200 what that gets more destiny

1539
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:58,560
can you sell individual cards i can but i can't be arsed setting them up

1540
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:06,240
i didn't care for it i didn't care for the mechanic because it's like um literally pennies

1541
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:10,560
like 35 cents like i'd rather

1542
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:20,240
the link three two two thank you for the extended membership hi strongy hi link

1543
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:28,080

1544
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:35,520
well if you're gonna oh what are you gonna do with that vaporeon plushy sir should i be concerned

1545
02:53:36,480 --> 02:53:43,440
i don't know hold on no sorry the controls are a bit funny you wouldn't think they are what they are

1546
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:45,840
and then put that back

1547
02:53:51,840 --> 02:53:53,360
someone technical crazy

1548
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:04,160
like a vampire mommy the various mechanics in this game can be optimized by mean you're not aware of

1549
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:12,400
is it selling cards that are open that are more expensive did you know that in terms of

1550
02:54:12,400 --> 02:54:14,800
this trying to have the same properties as the vaporeon

1551
02:54:18,480 --> 02:54:25,040
i might be a cuttlefish but i still go on the junk start a youtube channel and open your packs

1552
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:33,680
loud yeah that'll do it that'll maximize actually why isn't oh wait actually that makes

1553
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:39,280
i was about to say why isn't there a youtuber that opens card packs and has a store that they

1554
02:54:39,280 --> 02:54:48,480
endorse but people would just say like rigged like packets because you can like open them

1555
02:54:48,480 --> 02:54:55,760
there was something about like i could have sworn i heard about this it was like um if you weighed

1556
02:54:56,400 --> 02:55:05,120
the pokemon booster pack or whatever it was with a nano scale you would know if it was a reflective

1557
02:55:05,120 --> 02:55:11,360
shiny hollow elemental peon side because it was a it was like a little bit heavier than the other

1558
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:19,840
packets and i remember learning about i'm like oh my god they people take take it very seriously

1559
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:25,360
very seriously i would be glad to watch a hand cam opening pack streams oh boy do i have a treat

1560
02:55:25,360 --> 02:55:33,120
for you coming soon then or if the game let you collab with experts in the meadow there's some

02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:10,960

1566
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:20,960

1571
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:54,480
confused i was like what i was like uh why am i doing controller support and a cloud save what

1572
02:56:54,480 --> 02:57:01,280
does that mean i was like i'm not qualified for this i'm just i'm just the player what the heck

1573
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:08,000
you want me to start coding in the middle of my card shop right customers trade cards difficulty

1574
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:17,840
mode shop decoration playable tcg oh that's curious i'm not gonna be i don't want to be a

1575
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:29,600
syskeptical that's not a word sceptical andy but i would be very interested if they did complete

1576
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:36,080
that roadmap so this is early access i assume the way they're gonna play it is like oh we'll

1577
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:43,360
a have updates as the game comes out but like i don't know i don't want to be a meanie boweenie

1578
02:57:43,360 --> 02:57:48,480
because i'm sure they put their love in it and their soul into it and everything syskeptical i'm

1579
02:57:48,480 --> 02:57:55,600
sorry some packs of special cards have specific weights yes where some buyers and scammers literally

1580
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:59,920
came with an industrial weight scanner yeah like it was like a nano scale like down to like a

1581
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:08,080
boh here why is hypnotizing customers to spend more money not on the roadmap exactly like i just i

1582
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:12,880
don't understand right i assume i'm supposed to deal with the stinky customers are they like

1583
02:58:12,880 --> 02:58:22,000
make the other ones not feel good or something no i just got rid i just dealt with one of you

1584
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:29,040
i'm jumping i'm i'm jumping you that's right inner psh oh my god did i ever tell you right this is

1585
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:35,840
right before anyone starts laughing this is a mildly humorous story before anyone starts slapping

1586
02:58:35,840 --> 02:58:41,200
their knees saying this is the funniest thing they've ever heard it's amusing at most it's not that

1587
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:49,680
exciting okay it's not that exciting stop letting out don't laugh so i didn't know that their automatic

1588
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:58,480
air fresheners were a thing so when i visited my friend's house um we entered the room and

1589
02:58:58,480 --> 02:59:06,160
automatically went off because it it detected us and like i burst out laughing because i was like

1590
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:12,640
what is that um and she was like oh it's just a smelly thing like smell it it makes the smell

1591
02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:19,040
and i was like it detects if you're stinky when you enter the room and sprays you and i was like

1592
02:59:19,120 --> 02:59:25,840
rolling on the floor i was like because um it detected that it was stinky when i entered the

1593
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:31,280
room like i just found it the funniest thing ever and she was like surrounding it literally is just

1594
02:59:31,280 --> 02:59:36,080
automatic it senses you when you enter and i'm just i just found it the funniest thing because i

1595
02:59:36,080 --> 02:59:41,440
didn't even know it was like technology like that i'm like if it's stinky you're like a candle that's

1596
02:59:41,440 --> 02:59:46,160
where i come from you know these are there's where i'm from but uh yeah enter in the thing and it was

1597
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:52,720
i was like what is that why is it on yourself geez

1598
02:59:54,480 --> 02:59:59,760
um you can sell the valuable cards to make a profit over selling boosters

1599
03:00:00,640 --> 03:00:05,760
i know but i want to complete my deck i don't know what it looks like i mean i'm not exactly

1600
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:12,560
being open there's 106 pages but that's because there's hollows and like reverse shinies and stuff

1601
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:21,520
card collection 59 out of 1272 uh dev team i think you cooked a little too hard maybe

1602
03:00:21,520 --> 03:00:26,080
consider the hollow and reverses just put a little checklist in front because that's a

1603
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:31,680
bit you're cooking a bit too hard with that one that would be my honest feedback is don't count

1604
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:40,560
the hollows the shinies the reverses as a new card thing because i know for a fact that that

1605
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:46,160
does not seem right you're so damn cute do you know that well because i didn't know what's

1606
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:52,480
like automatic fucking shit detectors were oh no that was another point it was like

1607
03:00:52,480 --> 03:00:58,800
oh there's one in the toilet as well and i'm like imagine not even like finishing your job

1608
03:00:58,800 --> 03:01:05,280
being a squirt see on the back no because it's like no this is fucking reek and

1609
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:13,600
like this just this is just such a funny concept like i detect your stinky

1610
03:01:16,480 --> 03:01:22,400
i'm entertained easily okay i'm entertained easily it's the it's the simple things in life

1611
03:01:23,360 --> 03:01:29,600
it's the simple things no the beat no it's not even a bidet like imagine you stuck it to the

1612
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:34,000
wall behind your toilet and you're just like minding your own business and then you get like

1613
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:40,080
a wet spritz of perfume on your back and mid job but you're like excuse you and the machines

1614
03:01:40,080 --> 03:01:46,720
just staring back at you and not doing anything just blast the whole perfume and screams reloading

1615
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:53,040
that's that oh my god you you have an indian and then you go to the toilet and all you hear is

1616
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:58,320
the machine going because it's getting ready to like absolutely get ass blasted with perfume

1617
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:06,960
uh oh stinky imagine a voice yelling foul beast i need to do a voice pack oh my gosh i'll do a

1618
03:02:06,960 --> 03:02:15,760
voice pack okay for your your automatic spritzer machine i'm just doing my job there are more than

1633
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:12,960

1657
03:07:08,320 --> 03:07:21,680
i am mabzu is reviewing the worst iphone is that the next stream for vealer actually we're on

1658
03:07:21,680 --> 03:07:28,240
holodeck i need to message management to do the holodeck's tweet because we should have done that

1659
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:35,920
yep stream it means 45 minutes okay right i don't feel bad about redirecting you if it's only

1660
03:07:35,920 --> 03:07:44,320
45 minutes away it's the worst iphone games games that's a short moment right there

1661
03:07:45,280 --> 03:07:52,080
you better clip it so i can ship it uh yeah i've got i think i've got two more shorts coming

1662
03:07:52,960 --> 03:07:58,960
and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming but i'm gonna start doing uh i am so inspired

1663
03:07:58,960 --> 03:08:04,160
by eme and shebe i've seen some look i'm not leaking it okay but shebe's been working hard too

1664
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:10,800
i'm gonna do some shorts about making asmr content or like how much it earn or how it works

1665
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:16,800
blah blah blah so obviously asmr to me because i'm so used to it it doesn't like i don't think

1666
03:08:16,800 --> 03:08:20,560
anyone finds it interesting to learn about the behind the scenes but then i have to remember

1667
03:08:21,360 --> 03:08:27,840
that like because i've been doing it it seems mundane to me like when it comes to that stuff

1668
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:38,160
mommy's shorts um ac got a subscriber jump i wonder why i wonder what stream ac did that

1669
03:08:38,160 --> 03:08:45,760
might have caused her to have an increase in subscribers truly truly a mystery i just i

1734
03:17:03,920 --> 03:17:08,000
the baby pink collab went up if you didn't see it i'm gonna make a community post about it because

1735
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:16,400
i forgot to do that um and then i'm going to uh there's gonna be a peaches asmr collab next

1736
03:17:16,400 --> 03:17:25,680
and then the next kind of large scale type thing that might be happening at the allure is for the

1737
03:17:25,680 --> 03:17:34,480
talents that have more than 10 asmr roleplays um let's just say you might be watching you know

1738
03:17:34,480 --> 03:17:43,840
your local asmr's in a roleplay and then one of my girls might pop up and whisper and say that they

1739
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:51,760
also do asmr i'm gonna do a little ad campaign inside asmr videos for asmrists of my girls

1740
03:17:51,760 --> 03:17:56,640
it's gonna be ridiculous we're gonna try like because it might just be like absolutely hated

1741
03:17:57,440 --> 03:18:05,120
um but it's gonna be like a really quick clip insert um and obviously i'm gonna pay asmr

1742
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:12,960
is for it because uh vas asmrists love them lovely people um sponsorship opportunities

1743
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:20,320
come so few and far between and uh they try so hard the community try so hard they're fantastic um

1744
03:18:20,880 --> 03:18:29,280
and it's another way of being like hey do you want to make money whilst helping my girls guess what

1745
03:18:30,400 --> 03:18:38,240
um so yes the the only catch what not the shilling i know the only catch was the girls

1746
03:18:39,280 --> 03:18:45,200
that get in that ad campaign they do need to have like 10 asmr roleplays up because there's

1747
03:18:45,200 --> 03:18:52,400
no point in saying hey i do asmr and it's like like all livestreams or whatever um as always no

1748
03:18:52,400 --> 03:18:57,120
i'm not advertising myself in it because no uh not for me but i'll advertise them i'll put money

believe in us and now you only believe in us because you saw the success now don't get me wrong i

1820
03:27:53,440 --> 03:27:57,920
thing is is why didn't you apply for gen one and now you want to apply to gen two because you saw

1821
03:27:57,920 --> 03:28:03,920
the money you saw the success and it's like did you not believe in us it you know it has a bit of

1822
03:28:03,920 --> 03:28:14,160
like je ne sais quoi about it um and there's so many attributes as well because obviously of

1823
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:20,400
course people are gonna see this he says and be like i went in on that money i want whole bags

1824
03:28:20,400 --> 03:28:25,360
affectionately that yes you want money at the end of the day we're not a greedy company but you

1825
03:28:25,360 --> 03:28:31,120

1828
03:28:47,840 --> 03:28:51,840
i mean you know you know you guys are wet right to the touch

1829
03:28:53,200 --> 03:28:58,160
you guys are slimy right you know that thank you the bit of lord but you are slimy you can't

1830
03:28:58,160 --> 03:29:04,160
really touch electronics as well um it's a different spirit to the ones that take the

1831
03:29:04,240 --> 03:29:09,280
risks and the ones that are a bit more optimistic and seeing the results yes that's also very fair

1832
03:29:09,280 --> 03:29:13,280
to say obviously i'm not gonna be like oh my god i'm not accepting anyone because you didn't play

1833
03:29:13,280 --> 03:29:20,400
for gen one what i'm trying to say is to give it another perspective is the founding members and

1834
03:29:20,400 --> 03:29:30,640
obviously everyone else that respectfully applied um saw something in the company right before it even

1835
03:29:30,640 --> 03:29:38,960
launched right but gen two you can argue that they saw the success and want that type thing

1836
03:29:38,960 --> 03:29:43,440
anyway look we're gonna do our aspects i'm gonna fucking pull all the strings as always reeflands

1842
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:25,920
point there uh you would have to remember who applied for gen one uh let's just say my autism is
