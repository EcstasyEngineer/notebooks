1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Heh.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,920
Why you bully me liquid one sooner? Why you bully me?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,720
Look, I figured out how to lift the chair, okay?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,400
Just because I didn't do my hands doesn't mean that I couldn't do my leg.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Mommy's been pinned! No, I'm pinning the fucking chair!

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,440
Good morning!

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,160
Good morning!

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,680
Good evening! Good afternoon sleepyheads!

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,480
How are ya?

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,520
Hi hi! Momette is here.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,360
I put the little background music on.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,640
Look how cute that is!

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,840
That's so peaceful!

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,960
Now, there's some forbidden lore that I'm actually gonna message the concept that it's about.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,920
In another life, you looked very similar to the main character in the game

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,520
because you were a turnip in another beautiful life that I got you.

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,160
And you were still called reflin.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,040
Spelling was a wee bit different, but you were still called my little reflin and you were a

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,400
adorable little turnip.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,480
And you look very similar in this game.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,040
And I'm actually gonna contact your concept artist because you look incredibly familiar

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,600
in this game.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,600
And I'm like, why does everyone call her mummy?

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,680
Because in my Scottish accent, mummy is spelled phonetically as mummy.

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,120
I thought we were a radish.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,280
You are, but you look eerily similar to turnip.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
So I'm gonna see if the concept artist had that in mind.

28
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,760
Or if it was just by chance.

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,200
If it was just by chance, no big deal.

30
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
But in either case, both ways you're adorable, but I have to admit you're more

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,040
a little bit more arwardable in this.

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,000
So now yes, I understand you clicked on the stream and it looked like that.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
So I apologise.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,640
I woke up with very bad separation anxiety this morning and I do not feel I have the

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,960
vocabulary to present to you my little darlings and my heart rate was a bit above the

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
what my personal normal threshold is for my heart rate.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,360
So I've had to take my heart medication.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,600
But don't worry, it's not a big deal.

39
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,800
But instead, I thought we would play turnip boy commits tax evasion, which is such a freaking

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
cute thing.

41
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
Is turnip boy a leaked mascot from a gen two or perhaps?

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,040
Oh no.

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,400
Production takes a very long time.

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
I'm happy to say no.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
Fuck you, turnip boy.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
We're here now, mummy.

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,200
Get loved, get loved, get loved.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,160
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

49
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
But yes, we're going through this game.

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
Apparently this game takes two hours to play.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
Whether or not it's going to take me two hours to play is a whole different.

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
I don't even know what we're looking at for this gameplay.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,880
All I know is that it's cute and apparently it's accessible to new gamers.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
And that's all I need to know.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,360
That's all I need to know.

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
As long as I can finish it, that's all I need to know.

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,960
A turnip girl for gen two.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,520
You guys have far too much faith in me.

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
Endurance stream.

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,520
Tax bill.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,080
You owe a ton of property tax for your greenhouse.

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,720
You have until like yesterday to pay it.

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,400
Failure to pay will give Mayor Onion the deed to your house.

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,360
Total owed 143,753 and plus 50% interest.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
Sincerely the government.

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,560
Mayor Onion's official seal of approval.

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
Department of taxation.

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
Rip up or read what word of red is.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
So let's rip it up.

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,480
Nice Johnny.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,040
Hi, Riefling.

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
Oh, I got an achievement for ripping up.

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
Oh, turnip boy.

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,320
You really screwed yourself.

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,960
What do you mean what?

76
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,720
You committed tax evasion.

77
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,600
I did not talk.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,840
Uh, yes.

79
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Tax evasion is a real thing.

80
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,560
Anyway, you owe me a lot of money and you obviously have none.

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,200
So consider yourself my personal assistant.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,320
First, head over to the bustling barn through Leia Lane.

83
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm trying to set up a town hall there.

84
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,200
But there's a bunch of animals I need to take care of.

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,880
Oh, you don't talk.

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
You're non-verbal.

87
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Bring me back a bag of fertilizers, proof or you'll be sleeping with a rotten man.

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
Is the game volumes too loud, too quiet?

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,080
Indentured servitude.

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,120
That's illegal.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,600
It is.

92
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,480
Oh my God.

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,240
Look at the little chickadees.

94
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
Oh, Old Man Lemon's house.

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,760
Home of the extremely convenient watering can.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
I found a wort.

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,640
Use this to grow plants.

98
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
Used to be Old Man Lemon's.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,960
I need to talk to him.

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,600
Hello chat.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
Have you seen me old watering can?

102
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,480
Uh, my eyes aren't what they used to be.

103
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,080
I haven't seen for days.

104
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,040
That watering can means so much to me.

105
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,960
I really hope no one's stolen it.

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
The only thing I've left for the old lady.

107
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Oh, no.

108
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
Can we give it back?

109
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
I don't think we can.

110
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
Uh, hold on.

111
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,680
Me, me old trackers right in the way of the screen.

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,040
Hold on.

113
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
Let me, let me just recalibrate.

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,640
Let me run that immersion for five things.

115
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,080
The fucking things in the water screen.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,560
Okay, there we go.

117
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,200
Give it back.

118
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
It has social anxiety.

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Oh my God.

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,080
We have a watering can there.

121
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
Bravo to use.

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:07,920
Okay.

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,840
That's so cute.

124
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,160
Hello.

125
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,960
Hello there.

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
Just since the weather is lovely.

127
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Just as lovely as that strawberry down the screen.

128
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,840
She's so nice.

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,360
Oh, don't get me.

130
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,840
Don't get me.

131
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,320
Thanks for the super chat.

132
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Don't judge me.

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,440
I'm enjoying my little watering can game.

134
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,200
Thank you.

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,480
619 school.

136
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,360
Am I supposed to say old school?

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
Or did I literally go 619 school?

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,240
619.

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,200
Thank you for the super chat.

140
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,440
Oh, it's you going.

141
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,840
Oh wait.

142
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
It's you saying the dialogue in game.

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,400
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm not very.

146
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,600
Hold on.

147
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,000
I got it.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,320
Okay.

149
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,600
She's so lovely.

150
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
Say, could you water this plant for me?

151
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,320
I ran out of water and want to give this special flower to that special strawberry.

152
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,800
What?

153
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,440
I found this.

154
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,000
A flower.

155
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,880
A token of affection from the flowers to the strawberry.

156
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,960
A strawberry.

157
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh, literally right there.

158
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:08,880
Hi.

159
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,920
Turnip boy.

160
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,440
Thanks for the flower.

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,480
But I don't feel the same.

162
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,120
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,200
Oh, it's not from you.

164
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
Oh, thank the mushrooms.

165
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,320
The florist sent you this way.

166
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,040
How sweet are you?

167
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Do you think you can take this letter over to her from me?

168
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
Dear florist.

169
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,040
Thank you for the pretty flower.

170
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
Would you like to go on a date?

171
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,280
Some day we can even get married and pay our taxes together like strawberries.

172
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
I don't want the cage put on me for tax evasion.

173
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
So here's my straw me tax.

174
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,440
I don't want a cage put on me for tax evasion.

175
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
So here's my straw me tax.

176
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
So it stays there.

177
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,960
Thank you for the five.

178
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
Are you getting a cage put on you either way?

179
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,440
Heartless.

180
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
You tore up a love letter.

181
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
Wait, because it mentions taxes.

182
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,200
Hi.

183
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm a blooper.

184
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,000
You're a turnip.

185
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
Goodbye.

186
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,280
Okay.

187
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
Are these the bad guys?

188
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,200
Excuse me.

189
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,320
Wait, hold on.

190
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,120
I need another voice other than like Brineal from Skyrim.

191
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,080
A male voice.

192
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,560
Anyone.

193
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,560
Any male voice.

194
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
Any region.

195
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,440
Excuse me.

196
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,160
Ragaabao.

197
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,720
Add the lessons.

198
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,320
Please step away from the premises.

199
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,840
This is an IRS operation.

200
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,400
We need to secure the area before you pass.

201
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,680
This is not even a voice.

202
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,000
We've got our eyes on you.

203
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,760
Everyone's becoming French.

204
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,560
That's all I can do.

205
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:42,800
Right.

206
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,000
We got lemon.

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
He said it had to grow up to a lane.

208
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,400
Hold on.

209
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
Does this tell me what we believe in?

210
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,080
Layers lane is left.

211
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,400
Okay.

212
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:51,760
Okay.

213
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
We're going to layers lane.

214
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,760
Wait.

215
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,400
Westmore.

216
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Oh my God.

217
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,680
You can fall over.

218
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,320
Oh my God.

219
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,800
So I guess this is all my way to single.

220
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,840
Watch out for the snails.

221
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,960
They're vegetarians.

222
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,280
Oh.

223
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,800
Okay.

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
Hello, Mr. Blueberry.

225
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:15,760
Bro.

226
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,360
Bro.

227
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
You ain't going to believe this.

228
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,000
Jerry's been crashing at my place for a week

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,960
and he hasn't paid a single cent of rent.

230
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,400
We're on good terms, bro.

231
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Trust me.

232
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,280
But I don't speak much snail.

233
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
I don't really know what to do about it, bro.

234
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
Well, I can't touch them.

235
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm a turnip.

236
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm literally getting my health yanked off me.

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
Stony's ink tech.

238
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Snail.

239
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,720
Soil.

240
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Sword.

241
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,080
Patch ahead.

242
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,280
Bring a watering can.

243
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,840
Oh.

244
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,280
You'll never guess what I have.

245
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,480
I can see a person there.

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,480
Hello.

247
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,000
Hey, turnip boy.

248
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,520
I've been traveling around the farmland

249
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,440
and exploring the forest around it.

250
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,880
And I found something cool.

251
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,200
Up ahead is a rare plastic sordicus.

252
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,000
If you...

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Oh, planticus sordicus.

254
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
If you have a second, check it out.

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,200
Okay.

256
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
You don't have to tell me more.

257
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,920
Oh, it's snake paint.

258
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,320
Hello.

259
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,200
Thursday, launch patch.

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Someone please war this boy.

261
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Okay.

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Whoa, I found this.

263
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,840
The soil sword.

264
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,280
It's dangerous to grow alone.

265
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:29,680
Take this.

266
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,880
It's a legend to sell the reference.

267
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,200
Wait.

268
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,240
Oh.

269
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
You can only have one item at a time.

270
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,440
Okay.

271
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,120
Okay.

272
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll keep that in mind.

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
And then if I want to swap, I just...

274
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
It seems to pause the in-game time

276
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,400
if I do that, let's say.

277
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
We getting strapped.

278
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,840
We strapped.

279
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,360
Is that...

280
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,560
Winning for tax evasion.

281
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
No, I'm not.

282
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,280
Stop it.

283
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm not evading taxes at all.

284
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,800
I'm in...

285
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,000
Cerebritude.

286
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,640
That's different.

287
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:00,960
Hello.

288
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,720
Oh, heck.

289
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
I lost the baby.

290
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,760
I was told the baby said a little carrot.

291
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,360
I sat over him with the stool,

292
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
but he escaped my sight.

293
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,520
Maybe the stool needs to sit on me.

294
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,240
Either way, you can keep your eye whole peeled.

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,960
What?

296
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,640
I swear that's how the phrase goes.

297
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,400
You've lost a carrot?

298
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,160
How do you lose a carrot?

299
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Oh, I'm not arguing.

300
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,720
I don't know where the baby...

301
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,440
If the baby...

302
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,360
Are you got the baby and saved you?

303
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,160
Open up right now.

304
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,080
What did you give me?

305
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,080
Whoa, I found this rent money.

306
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,160
Jerry was going to pee his rent.

307
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,400
Oh, no.

308
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,040
We slid...

309
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,480
Oh, we...

310
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,640
Bro, why did you kill Jerry?

311
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
He was defenseless.

312
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,960
Why?

313
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,680
Oh, wait.

314
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,600
He had his rent money?

315
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
Oh, cool beans, man.

316
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,200
Mm-mm.

317
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,480
Bro, since he's dead,

318
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
take his check for the remainder.

319
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,760
I need that cash.

320
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Quarter of that in tax.

321
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,040
I hate tax.

322
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,320
How could you kill him?

323
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:22,800
Oh, sorry.

324
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,920
I just walloped into that.

325
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,880
I've just hurt myself.

326
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,360
Oopsie.

327
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,120
Reefling you, burp!

328
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,240
You can burp!

329
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,400
You can burp, darling!

330
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,760
10 out of 10 game, my Reefling can burp.

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,520
You're so lore-accurate.

332
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,960
Okay, now we go this way

333
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,360
because we have access, almost.

334
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,840
Oh, there's like little nickel cat farm.

335
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,800
Mummy's the greatest murderer.

336
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,760
Layer lane.

337
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
Oh, you're a carrot.

338
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,120
Oh, no, you're not.

339
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,320
You're something else.

340
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,520
You'll need a haircut, desperately.

341
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,880
Oh, but who's the great Edgar?

342
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,320
Best father and all of Edgy Vinn are my kidney.

343
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,440
A famous client of mine wants me,

344
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,280
the great Edgar, to dye their hair.

345
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,520
But alas, I do not have the dye to do it.

346
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,120
Obviously, this client is higher priority

347
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
than your dumb hair.

348
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,080
I urge you to come back another day.

349
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
See what I think about your property.

350
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,800
I take that.

351
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
That's what I think about your property.

352
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,760
You'd reshape the business.

353
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, my God.

354
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,360
Wait, this is a food show.

355
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,200
We can go on a date.

356
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,120
Welcome to Wee Sanguit, home of the tier three sub.

357
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,920
Is that supposed to be a Twitch Reference?

358
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,200
Can I take your order?

359
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,880
Oh, you don't want anything of yours.

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,000
Mm-mm.

361
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,880
Business has been really slow.

362
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,680
I wish I could get someone famous to eat our subways.

363
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
So, say, a live stream or something.

364
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,320
Wait, what?

365
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,560
This is a Twitch Reference.

366
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,120
What the fuck?

367
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
That would really bring up into the business.

368
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,120
Is that supposed to be if someone plays this game live,

369
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,040
then the chat starts gifting stuff?

370
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,760
Oh, there's a bin.

371
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,320
Or do I say, have you done your taxes?

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,840
Save 3%?

373
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,080
No!

374
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,520
How dare you?

375
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,040
I'm not doing my taxes.

376
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
Strongly can have my footlong sub.

377
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,200
It's not a footlong.

378
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,320
You know what?

379
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,280
It's a footlong.

380
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,160
Three of these.

381
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,560
How many inches is a footlong?

382
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm curious.

383
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,400
Help wanted.

384
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,360
Hiring exterminators to get rid of unwanted livestock.

385
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,320
What a cute little game.

386
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,280
Sorry, this game is absolutely perfect.

387
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,080
Ah, I'm loving it so far.

388
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,840
Are you okay if I have a quick tea break?

389
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,480
12 inches.

390
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Fuck it, hell.

391
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,760
12 inches is a footlong?

392
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,680
Who the fuck's walking around with 12 inches?

393
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,920
Subgamer, I'm...

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,400
Wait, is this Slay Queen?

395
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
That would be an eager voice.

396
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,560
How does the California voice again?

397
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
Number one.

398
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
Subgamer, I'm Mayor Unus's assistant.

399
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,760
But you've called me by my gamer tag, Slay Queen32.

400
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Huh?

401
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
Wait, I'm the best for...

402
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,840
Wait, what the fuck?

403
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,640
What's the vocal fry in California go like again?

404
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,280
I swear, Shibi did a fantastic emanation.

405
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,160
Emination?

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,680
Intimidation.

407
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,320
Valley girl.

408
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
What is a valley girl?

409
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
Oh my god, why can't I think of what a valley girl sounds like?

410
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,240
Holy shit.

411
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,000
Valley girl.

412
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,400
Um, I'm the best varculent player in Bendyville.

413
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,960
I want to tell you to check out my streams

414
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,240
that I haven't been able to go live since the pigs in here

415
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
make so much noise.

416
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
Oh, you want to get into the bustling barn?

417
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Well, I have some bad news for you.

418
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,280
Access is exclusive to my true fans,

419
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,520
so give me a tear thingy sub.

420
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,760
It wouldn't be fair to let you go in for free.

421
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,200
Be sure to like and subscribe, though.

422
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
What the fuck are you on about?

423
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
Mental mental.

424
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Yeah, I'm not subscribing to your ass.

425
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,760
What the fuck?

426
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,200
Unless I get a tax rebate.

427
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,400
Right.

428
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:29,840
Interact.

429
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,800
Kido, this is an active construction site.

430
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Stop, no, don't gift memberships

431
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
because the game is prompting it.

432
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,840
Thank you, boy, for the gifted membership.

433
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

434
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
We're not doing this.

435
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,680
Thank you, D-Man0302 for the gifted memberships.

436
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,160
Let me in.

437
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,400
Why am I no one?

438
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,120
I'm on break.

439
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,200
Brother, I work here.

440
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,120
See the documents to prove it real.

441
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,760
They're clearly...

442
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,520
Rip it up.

443
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,200
Where does it mention tax?

444
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,680
I don't know.

445
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,400
It's getting ripped up.

446
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,360
You tore up someone's 10.99.

447
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Oh, I see it.

448
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,560
I see the wee trophy.

449
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,560
Hello.

450
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,800
Trophy, reward the player so they stay engaged.

451
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,320
You obtained a chunk of gold that makes you feel good.

452
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, why is this game so good?

453
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
Hey, hello, turnip over here.

454
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,560
I have short-term memory loss.

455
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,920
I'm just trying to get a veggie bill.

456
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960
Please tell me where I am.

457
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
Oh, thank you.

458
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,840
I now know where I am.

459
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,960
I never said anything.

460
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
Pay taxes, of course, right.

461
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,360
Wait, does anyone go this way?

462
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,640
Trust me, you do not want to go down this alleyway.

463
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,480
There's some shady stuff down there.

464
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,120
Trust me, boy.

465
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,360
Right, well, no.

466
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
Oh, I literally can't go down.

467
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
Right, something's supposed to happen.

468
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,480
Hello.

469
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,600
Oh, hi there.

470
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,160
Are you looking to purchase some real estate?

471
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,040
Oh, turnip boy, I'm sorry about that.

472
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,440
I hope you get your greenhouse back soon.

473
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,960
I've been so busy lately.

474
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
Mayor Onion has been trying to raise property tax.

475
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,240
Mm-hmm.

476
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,560
It's been really hard to find new clients.

477
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,760
Yeah, I imagine so.

478
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,920
Oh, imagine so.

479
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,280
Right, hold on.

480
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,920
Let me drink my tea,

481
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,520
because it's going to get absolutely cold.

482
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,720
That shady stuff, my favorite.

483
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,280
Game is honestly pretty good and meta, is it?

484
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
I had no idea what to expect,

485
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,120
but from the opening alone, I'm happy.

486
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,520
So if I get filtered by a boss fight, that's on me,

487
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,480
because this is really good.

488
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,920
Wow.

489
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
Respect to the gifters.

490
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Literally role-playing, how dare you.

491
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,360
Thank you again to the gifters.

492
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,240
I appreciate that.

493
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Oh my God, you're asleep on screen,

494
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,600
because you're so sleepy.

495
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,360
Let me finish my tea.

496
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,760
No, the boss fights are pretty simple.

497
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
You're going to love this.

498
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,480
Oh, fuck yeah, this is my kind of game.

499
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,640
I'm about to recommend this game to all the girls.

500
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,800
I don't know if that's it.

501
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,080
I have like a little chat.

502
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,800
For the girls, and I put in two-hour games,

503
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,360
and I'm like, hey, here's a little game

504
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,000
that only took me two hours to only take you two hours.

505
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,440
Sleeping on the job, turnip boy.

506
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,080
Look, he had a big long night with me.

507
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,600
I didn't hear a refund, huh?

508
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
Oh yeah, I got some motherfucking work done.

509
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm so happy.

510
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,480
The VTuber Establishment Program is now up.

511
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,040
You can apply for it if you have an Establishment Program channel.

512
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,640
Just because you apply doesn't mean you get in,

513
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,680
but fucking, you never know.

514
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,160
Just apply.

515
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,560
I have fun.

516
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,040
Go for it.

517
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,160
I managed to edit AC's role play.

518
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,640
I managed to subtitle it up for her.

519
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,680
So that's out right now.

520
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,120
If you're in the business for ASMR,

521
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,520
AC has an ASMR role play out right now.

522
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,720
She was streaming earlier.

523
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,680
I don't know if she's finished.

524
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,880
Hi, Trani.

525
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,600
Hi, Evelyn.

526
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,160
Merci has sent me a role play.

527
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,400
I need to record me cutting my hair.

528
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I didn't do it yet, but I'm going to do it tonight.

529
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,080
And I am also editing the side collab.

530
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,320
I finally got to it in per side.

531
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,600
I felt so bad.

532
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,600
I had to send her a message,

533
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,240
and I was like,

534
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,080
you've accidentally sent me your voiceline sped up,

535
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
because I'm whispering and I'm really soft,

536
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,000
and I'm like, are you sure we should be doing this?

537
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
And then Said comes on and she's like,

538
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,880
yeah, I think it's literally really good.

539
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
I just did it in the middle of the day.

540
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,440
So I'm like, I'm so sorry Said.

541
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,280
You've accidentally sped up the voicelines

542
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,200
underneath the original, if you can.

543
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,520
So when she's ready, then that'll be done.

544
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,520
It was a cute mistake.

545
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,760
She's like, I don't know how I even managed that.

546
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,960
And I'm like, honestly, don't worry.

547
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,240
It happens all the time.

548
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
It happens all the time.

549
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,520
Because I was really slow.

550
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,080
And then she's like,

551
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,000
and I'm like, okay, I'm so sorry Said.

552
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm going to have to ask you to redo that.

553
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,960
Or resend me the original.

554
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,880
And I made a start on the baby pink viola collab.

555
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Yes, I know it's supposed to be a surprise,

556
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
but at this point,

557
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,640
bro, it's taken me so long to do any of the surprises.

558
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,400
I'm hoping Mercy, Said, and baby pink are all done tonight.

559
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,800
Now, baby pink is the way on hiatus right now.

560
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,600
She is going for a break,

561
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
her first time breaking a couple of years,

562
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,160
which I'm really happy about.

563
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,920
Her prove proper wasn't very well,

564
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,280
but the collab goes on baby pink's channel.

565
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,080
The artwork has been animated and all that.

566
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,680
They finally came to it took quite a while.

567
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,400
And then after that is peaches,

568
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,360
dream of peaches.

569
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,120
But don't be surprised if I'm going to try and arrange a collab.

570
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
This is just straight up what I plan to do.

571
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm going to see if I can arrange a collab between myself,

572
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
since it's their dream of peaches or peaches VTuber.

573
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,440
And baby pink, it'll be all four of us together,

574
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
which I think will be very nice.

575
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,040
I'm going to see if I can arrange that, get that done.

576
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
I've got a few more collabs on the way.

577
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
I'm trying to be quite social this month.

578
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
And then after that,

579
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,480
I'm literally just diving straight into being solo dolo.

580
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,920
I absolutely adore arranging collabs,

581
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,720
but I don't feel as uncomfortable with them anymore.

582
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,960
I felt very uncomfortable with them in another life,

583
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,720
but this time it feels, for things feel different for me.

584
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,080
In terms of yo, what peaches tell ya?

585
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,640
Well, peaches is like, you should say,

586
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,680
peaches was such a supporter of Vila when it first popped up.

587
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,720
She was like so nice.

588
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,920
I didn't expect her to like even give a rat's arse about it.

589
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,640
And she was like screaming from the rooftops about it.

590
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
She was like interacting and under all the posts.

591
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,440
And she's like so polite to the girls and that.

592
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Peaches is super, oh, she was just lovely.

593
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
So yeah, peaches and baby pink,

594
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
let me call in a favor with them.

595
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
And I'm really thankful for the opportunity

596
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,680
that they provided for the girls.

597
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,840
Yo, you will be able to reap the rewards.

598
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
Again, it's free access content.

599
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,160
It's not anything.

600
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,840
Peaches has short feature and she be saying,

601
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
but yeah, that's amazing.

602
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,880
I've not seen that on these click-ups.

603
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,360
But yeah, we, we've got fun things in the works.

604
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,680
But thank you for like our conversation yesterday.

605
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,960
Like just letting me talk about kind of like what work I have to do.

606
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,040
Because it helps me compartmentalize

607
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,480
and it made me realize that if I work every single day this week,

608
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,840
I will have cleared my entire work schedule.

609
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
I need to stop being afraid of working,

610
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,960
installing and just, just do it.

611
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Because unironically at the rate I'm going,

612
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,560
I will be done in three days if I keep up the stamina.

613
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,040
I'm not even kidding, three days and I'm done

614
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,320
and I can do all the fun.

615
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
Like literally I have a piece of paper right here

616
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,680
with all these ideas.

617
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,640
I've got, if I can even read them.

618
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,920
I've got a Twitter audio that ends in dumb loss for you.

619
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,440
I've got, I'll let you use a mirror on me

620
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,480
because I did a Baltrow wager.

621
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,560
I've got hypnotizing you to like pineapple pizza.

622
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,560
Girlfriend munches on your crusty socks ASMR.

623
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,360
Like all these fun goofy things we came up together.

624
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,920
I can do that once I have cleared my schedule.

625
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,080
Like, like it's happening.

626
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,960
It's hot.

627
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,840
Right, don't say no.

628
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,600
I know that other one was pretty gross.

629
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
But it's like, it's happening.

630
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,320
Don't let your dreams, literally all the memes are coming back.

631
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,400
All the fun stuff I want to do is coming back.

632
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,440
The girls that want to engage in YouTube role plays,

633
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
like they've got my full support.

634
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,920
Like Aisie is, she's going full steam ahead.

635
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,360
She's so excited to do it.

636
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,960
And yeah, she did fantastic in that role play.

637
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,040
And I'm not being funny, right?

638
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,520
So I was the one that edited Aisie's role play.

639
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,840
Like I wrote the script for her and that just to,

640
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,000
it was just a start to get her started type thing.

641
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
And then I think she's going to do stuff off the top of her head.

642
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,240
So obviously I wrote the end of it.

643
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,920
And I have to admit, you can hear her voice perk up

644
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,280
because in the script, I wrote, like Goodnight kisses you.

645
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,880
I love you, Dada.

646
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
I wrote that in the script for her to say,

647
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,680
and you can hear the infliction in her voice

648
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,960
at the end of that role play go up because she goes,

649
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,760
I love you, Dada.

650
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,680
And I thought that was a cute little thing,

651
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,480
like a little detail, a little cherry on top of that role play.

652
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,600
I thought it was very sweet.

653
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
Not the pineapple pizza, the crusty sock is fine though, you.

654
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,800
The crusty, wait, I just clogged that.

655
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,640
The pineapple pizza is the wrong one,

656
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,800
but the crusty sock role play where I'm munching on it.

657
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,320
It's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

658
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,560
I finished me tea.

659
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,760
I'm going to have some water as well

660
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,960
and you keep my hydration up.

661
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
Hey, since the schedule's changed,

662
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,000
how about you finish blanks?

663
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,640
You know what?

664
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,000
How about I put it in a cage right now?

665
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,560
How about that?

666
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
How about I put it in a cage and I swallow the key?

667
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,080
And the, no, no, we're not good with it.

668
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,600
Do you need some fans to donate some pre-crusted socks?

669
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
I wonder if that would make the noise more authentic.

670
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
I was just going to chew on some hard stuff.

671
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,640
I don't know if maybe I should do gag in ASMR.

672
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,400
Like I should purposely gag while I do it.

673
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,840
So I'm like, speaking of gagging.

674
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,880
Okay, indirect.

675
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,480
Oh, pardon me.

676
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,920
Right, what would an orange sound like?

677
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,160
The real estate agent sold me the studio apartment.

678
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,240
It's smaller, the most, the more expensive.

679
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm hoping the alleyway scenery pumps me full of creative juices.

680
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,120
Oh, yeah.

681
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,000
Right, we've spoken to everyone in this area.

682
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
Yeah, this is like locked off.

683
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,720
This place is off limits.

684
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Come back later when you beat the game.

685
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,760
Orders from the boss.

686
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,040
I don't know what it means either.

687
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,080
That's hilarious.

688
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,680
So there's post-game content.

689
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,040
Right, let's go back into town

690
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,880
because I clearly missed something.

691
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,360
Oh, sorry.

692
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
I made you twat, you mean thing.

693
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,520
I'll get the key back.

694
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,600
Uh, grim, I guess this is too early.

695
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,240
Interact.

696
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,240
What do you want, kids?

697
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
Listen, I'm getting ready to rob this.

698
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,480
Rob the rotten, I need complete focus.

699
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,000
And you seem like the annoying type.

700
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,400
Get out of my sight, kid.

701
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,360
How do you?

702
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,920
Right, so weapons wood with east.

703
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,440
We can't go down.

704
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,000
We've already, maybe we were to help the carrot person.

705
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
Oh, I keep doing that.

706
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,000
Sorry.

707
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,520
I keep rolling into the enemy.

708
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,120
I've slayed the beast.

709
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
Right, we're going to see if we can find the carrot over here

710
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
because I think that's what we're supposed to do.

711
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,120
But maybe if we slay all the enemies, we find the carrot.

712
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,400
Is there any up here?

713
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,440
Oh, wait, no.

714
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,920
What?

715
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,480
Oh, wait, no.

716
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,720
What?

717
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,320
Oops, I didn't even saw this.

718
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,640
What's up, dude?

719
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,080
Got any spray paint?

720
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,960
Yeah, I'm itching to vandalize some public property, you feel?

721
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,000
Wait.

722
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,120
But that's illegal.

723
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,320
You can't do that.

724
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,160
I guess I don't get any money, like in-game currency.

725
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,320
I might actually pay my taxes first or...

726
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,760
Okay, these keep respawning.

727
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,600
So I don't think that's what we're supposed to do, carrot.

728
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,400
I like your burps.

729
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,520
Oh, you just wait until the next emmy short comes out.

730
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,520
Someone has been very dedicated to clipping

731
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
emmy's burps in particular.

732
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,560
So I was just going to put a compilation together a little bit.

733
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,640
What?

734
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:08,800
I swear that's...

735
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,800
I don't know where the baby is.

736
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
I don't know if I'm supposed to actually help.

737
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,600
Is the baby in here and I need to jump in here?

738
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,680
No, I can't see if he is.

739
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,320
Least arranged pimple.

740
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,680
Base pimple, keep it up.

741
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,080
Big bro, literally.

742
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,040
Big bro knows what he wants.

743
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,600
Bruh.

744
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,280
Oh my god, right.

745
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,800
So I've posted emmy's short on Reddit

746
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,920
about her being really informative as a content creator.

747
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,560
Sorry, I can't for the life of me figure out what I'm supposed to do right now.

748
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,760
I feel like I'm missing something.

749
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,400
You really screwed yourself over.

750
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,960
Right, go head over to the bustling barn.

751
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,320
Okay, right.

752
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
There must be something at the barn that I missed.

753
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,160
And it was like a really informative thing about what AvTuber is.

754
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,800
Because some people think that we're loot tubers,

755
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,160
but there's a differentiation.

756
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,080
AvTuber is like you straight up do popcorn and we do audio popcorn.

757
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,000
Okay, I definitely missed something.

758
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,880
It must be in here.

759
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,000
Did she just let me go?

760
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,040
Did I need to like break her PC tail?

761
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,560
Did I need to water her?

762
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,160
Oh wait, did she want this?

763
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,120
No.

764
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,840
I'm gonna have to water her.

765
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,240
I'll show her you in love.

766
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
Yeah, you like that.

767
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,000
And fuck it, I'll break your PC while I'm on it.

768
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm definitely missing something.

769
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,560
Sorry, the brain cells.

770
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,480
You got to pay with your sub.

771
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,280
You got to pay for a sandwich.

772
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,600
Hi.

773
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,560
I would like food, please.

774
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,920
Welcome to waste sandwich home of the...

775
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,720
Oh, it's you again.

776
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,280
Wait, this is like Queen 30 tier...

777
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,440
32 wants a tier three sub?

778
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,280
Here, it's on the house.

779
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,320
Just make sure she eats it on stream so I can get that cloud.

780
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,120
Okay.

781
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,920
Sorry, this game is like a 10 out of 10.

782
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,280
It's so fucking cute.

783
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,360
And it's got all these things.

784
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,720
Oh god, I've forgotten how to do the AliExon.

785
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,320
The California.

786
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,040
California.

787
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,800
Oh my god.

788
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,280
I'll turn it, boy.

789
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,360
Thank you for the tier three sub.

790
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,080
As a tier three sub, you gain access to the bustling burn.

791
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,680
As well as my autograph.

792
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,960
Here you go.

793
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,200
Now, if only someone would do something about all those piggies making noises.

794
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,360
I'm just being able to actually stream.

795
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,400
Thank you for the tier sub.

796
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,160
Be sure to pay your taxes next time.

797
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,640
Like fuck I will.

798
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,160
Fuck you, bitch.

799
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,800
What are you?

800
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,840
Warning, active bombsite.

801
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,800
Water twice.

802
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,160
Hello, bomba?

803
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,840
Hello, bomba?

804
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,080
There's fucking nuclear bombs in this game.

805
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,560
Legalized nuclear bombs.

806
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,720
Oh my god, that's so good.

807
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,560
Thank you for the tier three sub.

808
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,360
Fuck you!

809
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,480
Okay, if I was from California, that's how I would do it.

810
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,640
Okay, we're clearing out the barn so she can stream.

811
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh, we have boots.

812
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,240
Whoa, I found this.

813
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,280
Boom boots.

814
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,160
Use these to kick boom blooms.

815
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,240
Run into them to send them flying.

816
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,320
Did I need to actually equip one?

817
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,320
It doesn't look like it.

818
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,640
Okay, what's this?

819
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,920
Hello, boom.

820
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,880
Oh wait, no, sorry.

821
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,320
Bravo, bravo.

822
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:10,720
Boom!

823
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,440
Oh my god, that's such a cool mechanic.

824
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,400
Boom, boom.

825
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,880
Oh wait, why did I do that?

826
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,480
Oh, all right, let's try that again.

827
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,280
Hold on, hold on.

828
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,680
That is...

829
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,240
I don't know.

830
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,320
I don't know.

831
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,880
I don't know.

832
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,440
I don't know.

833
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,400
Blah!

834
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,440
Boom.

835
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,640
Uh, owl.

836
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,920
Okay, there we go.

837
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,560
Bees make hun.

838
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,520
Uh, Racy, thank goodness you're not from California.

839
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,800
What are you talking about?

840
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,360
You don't like my vocal fry.

841
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,880
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

842
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,240
I don't mean I like that.

843
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,960
A little bit.

844
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,080
A little bit, I mean, but...

845
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,120
You don't like my vocal fry?

846
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,360
How did you tax my William?

847
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,520
Jo, I'm fucked your taxes!

848
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,800
Sick of them!

849
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,680
Okay, Mayor, Offices, Onion, okay.

850
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,840
Um, is that what I was supposed to do?

851
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:18,960
Wow.

852
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,080
Sorry, the controls are a bit...

853
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,440
Not what you expect them to be.

854
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,560
Wait, is that explorative reason?

855
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,040
Oh, a key!

856
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,920
Okay, okay, hello.

857
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,360
Okay, um, now back to the warren can.

858
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,480
And then kick them down.

859
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

860
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,520
I just want to keep being on the sword in case like...

861
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,000
Fuck you, beach!

862
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
Fuck you, beach!

863
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,000
Yickens!

864
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,960
I don't know if I'm supposed to kill the yickens.

865
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,480
I don't know, that seemed to rather mean...

866
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,840
I'm gonna just leave the chickens.

867
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,560
I think they're okay.

868
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,320
Oh my god!

869
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,120
Collateral damage on Ironically, sorry!

870
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,840
Didn't mean it.

871
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,280
Didn't mean it!

872
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,320
Collateral damage.

873
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,920
Let's let go!

874
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,200
Right, I've got one great...

875
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,880
Turnip boy is a vegetable of focus, commitment,

876
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,080
sheer will, something you know very little about.

877
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,120
I once saw him kill three snails in a barn

878
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,480
with a soil sword, an FKN soil sword.

879
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,320
Fucking soil sword, man!

880
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,280
Thank you, reluctantly seen for the...

881
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,720
The tip, fuck!

882
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
Thanks for your tip.

883
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,080
Um, hello, mummy.

884
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,280
He's to...

885
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
He's to root vegetable at and not filling a guvernant.

886
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,600
Imposed levees.

887
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,680
Boss fight!

888
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,520
King pay!

889
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,600
Uh, what?

890
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

891
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,880
Let's start watering shit.

892
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,640
I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm kicking him.

893
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,200
Nope, okay.

894
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,640
Hold on, you're too quick for my buddy.

895
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,320
Bunk!

896
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
Okay, let's try that again.

897
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,680
And then bunk.

898
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,760
Oh my God!

899
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,000
Not the game mode actually being accessible.

900
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,600
If the...

901
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,040
Oh my God, 10 out of 10 game.

902
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,600
If these are the boss fights, 10 out of 10 game.

903
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,560
You mean games that are actually fucking nice?

904
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,040
What?

905
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,920
Is that bacon?

906
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,080
Oh no, he turned into crispy bacon.

907
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,760
I would like to take that.

908
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
Whoa, you found a heart fruit.

909
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,080
This fruit gives you another heart.

910
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,560
Nifty!

911
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,320
Oh my God!

912
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
First try, zero death.

913
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,320
Bro, I'm sorry.

914
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,040
If the game's like this, this is an instant 10 out of 10.

915
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,320
Well, you found the fertilizer.

916
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,920
Makes things grow like crazy.

917
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,440
Why does he want that?

918
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
I don't know, let's break some stuff.

919
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,000
It seems that those who consume

920
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,560
fertilizer display mysterious properties,

921
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,080
such as rapid growths.

922
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,400
Yeah!

923
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,000
Did you know that some fertilizer,

924
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,560
some...

925
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,480
What is it?

926
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,480
It's not pesticides, some cropicides?

927
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
The ones that kill the crops.

928
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,440
Actually, instead of poisoning the plant,

929
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,360
they make the plant grow so rapidly

930
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,560
it can't sustain itself.

931
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,360
And the plant basically kills itself by accident.

932
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,320
Can you stream now?

933
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,320
Oh my God, thank you.

934
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,480
Some peace and quiet.

935
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
Turn it, boys.

936
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,480
Get this, thank you.

937
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,080
However, you have personally crowned

938
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,160
you as slay king, thank you.

939
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,400
Oh, I actually did get crowned.

940
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,720
Aw.

941
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,560
Heads up, you can view and equip

942
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,080
all the hats in the pause menu.

943
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,760
Oh my God, refling, you have a crown!

944
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,440
Cause you're my king!

945
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,680
Okay, I'mma put my sword on

946
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,120
cause I don't trust myself to not be out

947
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,000
without a sword.

948
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,160
Fertiliser is this world's steroids fan pretty much.

949
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,200
Did we just get hooked up with an arrow?

950
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,760
I thought so.

951
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,040
You're a kingling!

952
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,400
Keep your head up, kingling.

953
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,040
One...

954
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,760
Wait.

955
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,640
I'm glad those animals are at the picture.

956
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,120
This fertilizer will come in handy too.

957
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,680
All right, so your next task with my assistant

958
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,320
is to get me a four pronged spear.

959
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
In ancient times, it was known as a fork.

960
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,840
Assistants don't ask questions.

961
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
Word on the grapevine

962
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,920
is that there's one in the forsaken farmhouse

963
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,640
that's supposedly south of here.

964
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,320
I've heard horror stories

965
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,120
about a bunch of moldy sweets in that place.

966
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,520
You're in no place to complain.

967
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,680
Go and get my fork.

968
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,440
Okay.

969
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,160
Geez.

970
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,960
Right.

971
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,600
Okay, yeah.

972
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,640
So these are moved out of the way.

973
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
So this is definitely correct direction.

974
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,760
Hello.

975
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,080
What do you see?

976
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
You like to learn new dances

977
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,160
and post them on flip-flop.

978
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,400
Oh my god, this game's so cute.

979
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Sometimes I'll even do karaoke.

980
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,920
Oh, karaoke.

981
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,280
Did I say karate or karaoke?

982
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,080
Hi there.

983
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
I'm a teacher from a nearby patch.

984
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,800
Nice to meet you.

985
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,880
I would love to stop and talk

986
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,240
but I have to attend to my class.

987
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,280
We're on a field trip.

988
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,120
This place is pretty cool.

989
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,560
There is an interesting cave.

990
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,280
I want to have the kids check out later.

991
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
I bet you were doing a rescue mission.

992
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,920
Oh, give me that manual.

993
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,280
I want to rip it up.

994
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,880
Okay, so the pupper.

995
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,600
All tangerine dogs will cease to exist

996
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,640
when the game is being.

997
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,840
Whatever that means.

998
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,680
So there is a ton of post game content.

999
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,440
That's the second post game content.

1000
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:05,920
Wallop.

1001
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,960
Wallop.

1002
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,360
Wallop.

1003
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,720
Wallop.

1004
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,600
I'm walloping everywhere.

1005
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,160
I must go.

1006
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,640
Hope you enjoy evading those dine taxes.

1007
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,440
Thank you.

1008
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:15,840
I must go.

1009
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,080
Hope you enjoy evading those dine taxes.

1010
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,640
Thank you, Lord of Storms,

1011
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,600
to the Super Chat.

1012
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,480
I appreciate it.

1013
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,360
Fertilizer.

1014
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,400
Hardly even know her.

1015
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,400
Oh, come on.

1016
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,880
Stand aboard.

1017
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,680
Don't be shy on me now.

1018
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,240
Hold on.

1019
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,800
Hold on.

1020
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,280
Hold on.

1021
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,920
Let me get up.

1022
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,240
It's just shy.

1023
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,800
Hold on.

1024
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,840
Fertilizer.

1025
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:40,640
Hardly even know her.

1026
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,520
Thank you.

1027
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,560
Thank you.

1028
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,760
I don't know why I'm so shy there.

1029
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,400
Yeah, we live pretty far down from town.

1030
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,840
It's scary to go over there.

1031
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,520
So we just vibe here.

1032
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,440
Just swinging back and forth as one does.

1033
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,120
So the carrots don't want to move.

1034
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,320
I can't get into the house.

1035
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,200
I bet the view from that deck would be amazing.

1036
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,000
Too bad the stairs are broken.

1037
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,800
Maybe we could use a stool.

1038
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,720
Wait, is that a JoJo reference?

1039
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,240
Oh, come on.

1040
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,320
Come on.

1041
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,040
What is that?

1042
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
Was that a Rero?

1043
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,680
Am I supposed to read that Rero, Rero, Rero, Rero, Rero, Rero, Rero?

1044
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,640
Like, come on.

1045
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,240
Okay, come on.

1046
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,560
Sorry.

1047
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,760
This game is so good.

1048
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,400
I don't care.

1049
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,360
Do you like my specifically placed collection?

1050
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,920
They're totally not keeping you in the level or anything.

1051
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,040
That would be work.

1052
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,360
Sorry.

1053
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,520
I love games that acknowledge how frustrating that is.

1054
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Okay, you found this was carrot baby.

1055
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,280
The babysitter must be looking for it, right?

1056
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,560
Let's go give the carrot back to the babysitter or I'm going to forgo.

1057
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,760
Oh, wait, can I?

1058
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,840
I just saw something I couldn't.

1059
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,720
Child acquired.

1060
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,400
I literally have a child in my inventory.

1061
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,880
Stop it.

1062
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,800
You, you're getting ripped up.

1063
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
12.3% tax.

1064
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,640
Not on my watch.

1065
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,000
Imagine if I accidentally got 100% collection.

1066
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,360
Okay, I'm going to go back to the babysitter

1067
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,160
because I'm going to forget that I even have this child on hand.

1068
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,560
So, well, it's got dark.

1069
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,120
Literally.

1070
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,840
Wait.

1071
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,320
Oh my God.

1072
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,600
It's a dumpster baby.

1073
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,920
I was like, what do you mean it just got dark?

1074
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,800
But you're right.

1075
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,160
It's a dumpster baby.

1076
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,240
Oh, I never put you in the dumpster refund.

1077
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,200
Um, no.

1078
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,560
Oh my God.

1079
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,400
Sorry.

1080
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,600
I need to invest in the game.

1081
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,960
This dev team.

1082
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,400
You found him.

1083
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,720
Thank you so much.

1084
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,600
Take my soul.

1085
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,600
He can't get away this time if he's on my head.

1086
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,400
Oh, right.

1087
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,640
Okay.

1088
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:08,960
Okay.

1089
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,720
That's literally what we were supposed to do.

1090
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,000
We were supposed to backtrack.

1091
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,240
Okay.

1092
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,880
We have a still.

1093
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,160
So now we can go on the deck.

1094
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,720
You wouldn't mind me being on your deck, right?

1095
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,520
You know, a bit of height advantage.

1096
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,000
Sorry.

1097
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,040
It's too easy.

1098
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,920
It's too easy.

1099
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,480
Stop it.

1100
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,400
I need to look in the dev team of this game.

1101
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,720
Sorry.

1102
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,640
This is just absolutely fantastic.

1103
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,560
Thoroughly enjoying this.

1104
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,320
This is a very gamer, accessible, very friendly,

1105
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,360
very, um, kawaii desune.

1106
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,280
It's getting all the points.

1107
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,840
All the points.

1108
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,880
You can wax my deck.

1109
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,160
You want me to wax it?

1110
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,400
I mean, I could if you...

1111
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,080
Dear Joe, mom and dad grounded me for breaking the front window.

1112
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,640
But Matt was the one who did it.

1113
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,920
I ain't no snitch, but I wish he'd bested her.

1114
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,200
What is these funky tunes?

1115
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,720
Oh my God.

1116
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,200
Ow!

1117
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,560
Why is it farting at me?

1118
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,520
Stop it!

1119
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,720
Stop farting at me.

1120
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,360
Right now.

1121
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,280
Thank you for burping, Lucy.

1122
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,240
What's this?

1123
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,760
A doctor's mask.

1124
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,680
Stay six feet away, right?

1125
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,280
What does that do?

1126
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,280
I don't know.

1127
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,160
You're in a haunted house anyway.

1128
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,480
Bomba.

1129
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,280
Okay.

1130
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,880
New mechanics.

1131
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,320
Hmm.

1132
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,000
There's definitely something...

1133
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,840
Dear Joe, I went to Matt's baseball game today.

1134
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,120
I was so weird since everyone was wearing masks.

1135
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,680
And we set fire from all the other problems.

1136
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,840
Matt hit a ton of home runs though.

1137
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,680
However, there's definitely something new.

1138
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,480
I don't know.

1139
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:08,960
I don't know.

1140
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,680
I don't know.

1141
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,240
I don't know.

1142
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:10,880
I don't know.

1143
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,440
I don't know.

1144
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,080
I don't know.

1145
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,640
I don't know.

1146
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,280
I don't know.

1147
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,080
I don't know.

1148
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,000
Definitely something I'm supposed to do.

1149
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,120
And it's not clicking what I'm supposed to do.

1150
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,280
You push it into the hole once you get an item.

1151
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,920
Oh, but I will continue to explore.

1152
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,800
Oh, I don't like it.

1153
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,160
I don't like sorry that I don't like things that touch me.

1154
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,360
Like that's really far away.

1155
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,400
That's cheating.

1156
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,240
That wasn't very pleasant.

1157
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,680
Please don't do that again.

1158
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,240
I didn't actually expect to get a little bit

1159
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,200
scared in this game.

1160
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,600
Sorry.

1161
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,320
I know I'm a big baby, but I don't like things that grab

1162
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,280
and that have long arms.

1163
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:53,840
Hello.

1164
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,320
Ho, ho, ye horses there partner.

1165
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,240
Did you really just destroy our 40 vocations?

1166
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,520
Well, you better be willing to help out to cover the costs.

1167
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,160
I'm a little bit in debt.

1168
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,440
I'm a bit short on change.

1169
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,440
Go over yonder to the mission board.

1170
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
Some folks got some work that needs to be done.

1171
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,640
Now don't look so down.

1172
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,920
It's the least you can do.

1173
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,600
Take this key.

1174
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,240
You should be able to explore the farmhouse some more

1175
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,760
and get some work done.

1176
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,840
Now just be careful.

1177
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,200
There's rotten food.

1178
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,000
If you wanted to be the real doll,

1179
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,840
you could start up that generator.

1180
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,440
And does these actually have missions?

1181
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,360
Supplies needed.

1182
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,320
We need bandages and pills.

1183
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,680
We need an archery.

1184
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay.

1185
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,640
Okay.

1186
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:48,960
Oh my God.

1187
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,000
It literally goes okay.

1188
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:52,960
Oh my God.

1189
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,360
Sorry.

1190
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,640
I really don't like that.

1191
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,600
I don't like that.

1192
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,880
Please don't do that again.

1193
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,680
Do you understand?

1194
00:46:59,520 --> 00:46:59,840
Okay.

1195
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,560
We got medicine.

1196
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,840
The chair of proof the cap.

1197
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,320
Oh my God.

1198
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,040
That's our candy handle things that do that to me.

1199
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,960
All right.

1200
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,760
We need one more thing and then we're okay.

1201
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,080
Please.

1202
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,360
No more grabbing things.

1203
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,080
I will cry.

1204
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,800
Oh my God.

1205
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:15,840
You there.

1206
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,440
Yeah.

1207
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,640
You turnip head.

1208
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,200
Don't be alarmed.

1209
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,400
I too can hold weapons with no hands.

1210
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,440
That's how I know you have mafia blood.

1211
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,760
Are you related to Don Ternopachino?

1212
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,600
If you are, you're lucky I'm in this jar.

1213
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,720
If I weren't, you'd be sleeping with a rhyme.

1214
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,880
That mobster family decided to step on our turf.

1215
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,720
Who do they think they are?

1216
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,000
Holding their meetings in that stupid greenhouse.

1217
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,520
What?

1218
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,160
Okay.

1219
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,840
She's lost her babies.

1220
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,600
Well, hello there, hot stuff.

1221
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:02,640
Hm?

1222
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,040
Those leaves on top of your hut are so blah.

1223
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,520
Say, cutie, could you pick up some medicinal supplies for me?

1224
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,160
I'll eat bandages, medicine, and a mouse.

1225
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,120
Think you can handle it?

1226
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,440
Uh, yeah.

1227
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,480
Can I have the key though?

1228
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,520
Can I have the key?

1229
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,320
You know, give key?

1230
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,040
It was only two seconds.

1231
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,240
I turned away for two seconds and my baby sister wandered off.

1232
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,320
I'm supposed to be the adult here.

1233
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,120
After the rot took her parents.

1234
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,880
I've been taking care of the family.

1235
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,480
Now my little sister is gone.

1236
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,840
Oh wait, you'll help?

1237
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,280
Thank you so much.

1238
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,760
A place for you for the cupcake monsters.

1239
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,640
Really, like, don't you?

1240
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,520
Don't you?

1241
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,600
Right, well, if you give me a fucking key then...

1242
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,360
I have a secret stash of brownies hidden in the icebox.

1243
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,880
Max keeps eating them and then once we can't find them...

1244
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,360
Give me them!

1245
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,000
Hello there, sunny Jim.

1246
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,440
I thought that the newcomer might be my son,

1247
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,640
but there's a new face.

1248
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,640
It's definitely a sight for sore eyes.

1249
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,120
I don't think I'll ever be able to leave this icebox,

1250
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,360
but I hope someday I get to see my son again.

1251
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,720
Ah, right.

1252
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,160
So no one's given me a key?

1253
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,280
Every time.

1254
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,800
So no one's given me a key?

1255
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,720
Right, I know he's in here.

1256
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,680
Stop it.

1257
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,720
Fuck off, you're bad.

1258
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,240
How or what am I supposed to do?

1259
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,320
Have I?

1260
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,640
So no one's given me a key?

1261
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:02,880
Oh.

1262
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,160
Dumbass.

1263
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,240
Monk.

1264
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,320
Okay.

1265
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,400
Toilet sound.

1266
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,640
Oh.

1267
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,040
Wait, what?

1268
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,720
That didn't make it a watermelon?

1269
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,440
Okay, there you go.

1270
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,400
Okay, okay, okay.

1271
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,000
So we can do the medical supply one.

1272
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,320
Got it.

1273
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:28,720
Monk.

1274
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,800
And then we take the sword out because that thing's going to be bandaged.

1275
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,480
And he's a medical strip.

1276
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,400
Okay, we get to talk to the sexy lollipop.

1277
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,960
Whoa, hold on a minute.

1278
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,560
That's the best code word for something else around these parts.

1279
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,360
And no, I'm not having dinner with you.

1280
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:47,840
Stop it.

1281
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,920
You're terrifying, honestly.

1282
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,080
What is this game?

1283
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,360
It's like a cute little thing.

1284
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:00,720
I don't know.

1285
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,560
My knight in shining armor.

1286
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,400
Oh, thank you, darling.

1287
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,000
Here's a key sugar.

1288
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,760
Darling, come and see me if you need something.

1289
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,000
And he came to me.

1290
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,640
I'll shock you.

1291
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,360
Don't think I won't.

1292
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,280
Right.

1293
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,040
Let's get right right.

1294
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,000
Time to attack.

1295
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,880
Every time you respawn and you give me a heart attack, stop it.

1296
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,160
Roleplay is the character when you want me to roleplay as that.

1297
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,800
That's funny.

1298
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,080
But right, you need to stop because he literally gets free hits in because I can't

1299
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,120
he like reach him.

1300
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,680
What would the watermelon do?

1301
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,120
Oh, gloves.

1302
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,480
What?

1303
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,200
I found this.

1304
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,320
The movement and use these to push move melons.

1305
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:52,640
Wait.

1306
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,320
Do you have hands?

1307
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,880
Not me.

1308
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,960
And he's going to drop that.

1309
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,200
And it just drops as a heart.

1310
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,560
Oh, there's nothing in particular here.

1311
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:08,800
Okay.

1312
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,800
I guess I just teach you the mechanics.

1313
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,680
Jojo.

1314
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,600
Mom got me some new mittens that look like slices of watermelon at the flea market today.

1315
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,680
Oh.

1316
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,000
You make a little fart noise.

1317
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,120
Fart night more like fart night.

1318
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:29,760
What?

1319
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,120
I can do this to avoid the boat.

1320
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,680
Oh, okay.

1321
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:31,920
Okay.

1322
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,080
Okay.

1323
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,240
Okay.

1324
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,600
I always forget you.

1325
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,560
I'm going to be honest.

1326
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,120
Stop it.

1327
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,640
You freak me out so much.

1328
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,280
Stop it.

1329
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,520
You terrify me.

1330
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,840
And push.

1331
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,520
And we need key.

1332
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,400
We could just bomb it all the way down.

1333
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,480
Move what melon?

1334
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,160
You don't want me Flynn.

1335
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,120
I'm actually coming.

1336
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,520
Why am I getting dragged?

1337
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,520
I'm just playing a kill of pigs with you.

1338
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,520
I do indeed have hands.

1339
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,560
I'm going to see what they can do.

1340
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,320
My fucking HP.

1341
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,680
I lost your baby.

1342
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,960
Carly's looking for you.

1343
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,440
Okay.

1344
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,280
Bruh.

1345
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,320
I'm so bad against them.

1346
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,760
Oh my God.

1347
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,920
I got Zach Dream to sign my gigasword poster.

1348
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,400
Why we do?

1349
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,200
Don't say gigabit in front of a French person.

1350
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,080
I'm literally going to die.

1351
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,880
Oh my God.

1352
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,240
I think the fuck not.

1353
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,880
Draft Dodger.

1354
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,160
You tore up the draft letter.

1355
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,640
Damn right.

1356
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:46,960
I did.

1357
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,520
He's going to buy into that.

1358
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:51,760
Oh my God.

1359
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,040
Is that a legend of Zelda?

1360
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,120
Monk.

1361
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:55,760
Is that you?

1362
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,560
Right.

1363
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,600
We have a key down there.

1364
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:57,840
Right.

1365
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,480
There's a fight.

1366
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,360
You need to stop it.

1367
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,040
You're giving me a heart attack every time I see you.

1368
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,200
Gigabits.

1369
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,520
What does gigabit mean?

1370
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,440
It means massive Willy.

1371
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,400
To say Willy in French, you say bits.

1372
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,320
And then to say big giga.

1373
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,800
So basically, if you say, oh, I've got gigabit internet.

1374
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,360
All they hear is big cock internet.

1375
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,240
Ha.

1376
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,520
Thank you.

1377
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,160
Mushroom.

1378
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,120
Thank the mushrooms.

1379
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,720
My little sister is all right.

1380
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,760
Thank you for getting her back.

1381
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,480
Thankfully, you're the key for your troubles.

1382
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,200
Thank you.

1383
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,960
I too have big cock internet.

1384
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,520
Let's look.

1385
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,880
Remember.

1386
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,960
Popo.

1387
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,600
What?

1388
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,480
Poo poo pee.

1389
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,600
No draft for me.

1390
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,320
Real and true.

1391
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,800
I like your little burp when you heal up.

1392
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,800
Sounds like something.

1393
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,360
OK.

1394
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,600
Let's see what's behind door number.

1395
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,560
Oh, there's a note on the bed.

1396
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,440
We deeply regret to inform you that Captain

1397
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,720
has been missing in action.

1398
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,320
Upon receiving further information,

1399
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,600
you'll be advised immediately.

1400
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,160
Oh my God.

1401
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:08,640
What?

1402
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,280
Missing in action?

1403
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,640
Oh, no, that's fine.

1404
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,600
We don't want them to be.

1405
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,080
Pidders.

1406
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,520
Gimli, I'm sorry.

1407
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,160
I don't pet you.

1408
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:20,640
I'm sorry.

1409
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,560
Oh, Gimli.

1410
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,280
What the heck?

1411
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,080
She's spinning.

1412
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,200
Gimli spinning.

1413
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:31,680
Gimli.

1414
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,760
No, stop it, Gimli.

1415
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,160
Oh, Gimli.

1416
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:36,800
Wait, wait, hold on.

1417
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,400
If I wait, so I need to.

1418
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,040
OK, hold on.

1419
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,920
I can do this.

1420
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,840
Gimli, stop it.

1421
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,640
Stop spinning.

1422
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,760
You're making me nervous.

1423
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,520
No, don't cough up another worm.

1424
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,480
I told you to stop eating worms

1425
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,920
in the garden and you well may stop.

1426
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,640
Did I tell you?

1427
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,320
Gimli brought me a cockroach

1428
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,920
and I don't know what cockroaches are

1429
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,600
because I've never seen them before

1430
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,240
and Gimli brought one into the freaking house.

1431
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,800
That was nice.

1432
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,200
And you know what the worst part was?

1433
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,120
She brought it in.

1434
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,920
Wait, what's going on?

1435
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,600
She brought it in and she ate it right in front of me

1436
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,640
and I'm like, you know what?

1437
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,080
Thank you for not making me clean up

1438
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,680
but at the same time, Gimli, no.

1439
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,760
No, we do not eat worms.

1440
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:23,360
Sorry, not worms.

1441
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,400
We do not eat freaking.

1442
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,920
And we don't bring them into the house either.

1443
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,600
They upset me.

1444
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,640
OK, they upset me.

1445
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,600
OK, you, bonk.

1446
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,120
Take that.

1447
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:34,480
Bonk.

1448
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:35,840
Oh my God.

1449
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,960
Wait, you can like spam.

1450
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,960
Stop.

1451
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,320
Wait, this is like such a...

1452
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,920
Oh, I can't reach them that way.

1453
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,640
That's OK though.

1454
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,720
I don't know.

1455
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,920
I'll just put the bomb there.

1456
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,480
Oh, she almost got me.

1457
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,560
Oh, you eat cheekies.

1458
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,120
Get you.

1459
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,880
Oh my God, I think we've done it.

1460
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,280
Oh, no, we've not.

1461
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,240
Oh my God, I'm so skinny.

1462
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:58,960
Did you see that?

1463
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,920
Did you see those moves?

1464
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,440
Sorry, I'm going to have to defeat my little...

1465
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1466
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,040
Can someone drop a wee heart?

1467
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,680
Oh, thank you.

1468
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,080
Thank you.

1469
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:06,400
OK.

1470
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:07,920
Oh, thank you.

1471
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,560
Wait, go on then.

1472
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,600
You could have gone your own life

1473
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,360
without seeing a cockroach, honestly.

1474
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,000
Honestly, she brings it in.

1475
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh, what's this?

1476
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:19,920
What?

1477
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,760
I found this lost cat apple.

1478
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,360
Cran-cran's little red munchkin.

1479
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,760
What a naughty munchkin.

1480
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,680
Oh my God, stop.

1481
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,720
This game is so fair.

1482
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,400
I found a heart for it.

1483
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,320
It gives you another bit of heart.

1484
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,800
Thank you.

1485
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,920
Maybe a little secret note here.

1486
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,240
Maybe a secret note down here?

1487
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,280
Is that everything in the boss room?

1488
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,120
Uh, this is not going to work.

1489
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:48,560
Sorry, this game's already a 10 out of 10.

1490
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,200
It's suspended.

1491
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,520
Machine go.

1492
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,480
Oh, big machine goes.

1493
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,480
OK.

1494
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,480
Oh, what are you?

1495
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,240
You found spray paint.

1496
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,520
Oh, I know where to go.

1497
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,960
We know where to go next.

1498
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,120
Interact.

1499
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,960
Oh, we put the light on.

1500
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,640
Oh, now the place is all not on.

1501
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,320
Well, is it still haunted?

1502
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,560
Not haunted, you know?

1503
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,400
I remember when.

1504
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,800
Hey, eternal boy.

1505
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,760
It was nice studying this place,

1506
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,240
but I got to go take my notes back to the research lab

1507
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:24,720
in a bit.

1508
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,880
Side note, did you see the pickled gang?

1509
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,360
Yeah.

1510
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,920
There are some tourist gang around these parts.

1511
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,440
I'm surprised they haven't enlisted anyone

1512
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,880
to try and help them break out yet.

1513
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,040
Please do not help them.

1514
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,320
Oh, well, good thing you told me that

1515
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,440
because I probably...

1516
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,600
That looks horrific.

1517
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,720
The heck did you freaking say about me,

1518
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,440
you little turnip?

1519
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,520
I'll have you know I graduated top of my class

1520
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,720
in the past of seals.

1521
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,360
I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the bar

1522
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,440
and I've over 300 confirmed kills.

1523
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,120
I'm a trained in guerrilla warfare

1524
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,840
and I'm a top sniper in the entire pasta armed forces.

1525
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,000
You're nothing to me but another target.

1526
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,880
I will wipe you the freak out with my precision.

1527
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,840
The likes of which has never been seen before on this earth

1528
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,440
mark my freaking words.

1529
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,760
You think you could just get away with saying that crap to me

1530
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,880
over the grapevine?

1531
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,080
Think again, turnip.

1532
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,960
As we speak, I am contacting my secret network of spies

1533
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,080
across the farmland

1534
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,080
and your leaves are being traced right now

1535
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,560
so you better prepare yourself from the storm, maggot.

1536
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,480
The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing

1537
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,520
you call your life.

1538
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,920
You're a freaking dead kid.

1539
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,760
I can be anywhere, anytime.

1540
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,560
I could kill you in over 700 ways.

1541
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,520
And that's just with my bare hands.

1542
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,320
Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat

1543
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,600
but have access to the entire arsenal over the past of corpse

1544
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,440
and I will use it to its full extent

1545
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,160
to wipe your miserable butt off the face of this continent,

1546
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,280
you little crap.

1547
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,640
If only you could know what unholy retribution

1548
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,720
your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you.

1549
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,040
Maybe you would have held your freaking tongue

1550
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,720
but you couldn't, you didn't

1551
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,200
and now you're paying the price, you dang idiot.

1552
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,360
I will crap fury all over you

1553
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,480
and you're drowning it.

1554
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,840
You're freaking dead, kiddo.

1555
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,360
I didn't even say anything, geez.

1556
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,160
Darn, too, and you started the generator.

1557
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,240
Well, can't stay mad at you after that.

1558
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,480
This ain't much but this is what we'll go.

1559
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,400
We got a four, the four pronged spear.

1560
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,480
Sadly, I have to give it to that onion.

1561
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,160
So am I supposed to whack him out or not?

1562
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,920
I don't think I want to.

1563
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,400
Ah, geez.

1564
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,800
I wish I could guard the main door.

1565
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,560
It seems like everything cool happens there.

1566
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,800
Someone just burst through the door.

1567
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,600
That's so cool.

1568
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,920
Maybe I'm just not good enough with the guard.

1569
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,600
That explains why they have me in the prison.

1570
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,360
I feel like a good guard.

1571
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,800
I wish they would give me a shot.

1572
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,360
Am I actually to help them?

1573
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,920
Well, I can't even get them out.

1574
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,120
Me and the boys are trying to break out.

1575
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,640
I can't even get them out anyway.

1576
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,040
So he's on his own.

1577
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,280
Once I kick them out, no.

1578
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,320
I can't even get them out.

1579
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,120
This is mad.

1580
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,280
Intrusive parts are winning.

1581
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,800
Me like, thank you for telling me not to do that.

1582
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,400
Also me, hee hee.

1583
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,360
Oh, let me try and get them out.

1584
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,520
Probably later, yeah.

1585
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,200
I'll come back to the mafia.

1586
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,360
Maybe we need to recruit the pickle mafia.

1587
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:33,920
Um.

1588
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,880
Maybe post game.

1589
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,960
This game is very kitted out for post game.

1590
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,000
Lately, it's known about how many fish there are in the pond,

1591
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,800
but it seems we can only observe one at a time.

1592
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,480
Hello.

1593
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,040
Ow, what?

1594
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,760
I was going to be nice.

1595
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,840
We can shove up your arse, honestly.

1596
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,560
What's this way?

1597
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,200
Rocks.

1598
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,600
Okay, looks like we can destroy rocks at a later point.

1599
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,240
Okay, okay.

1600
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,320
Okay, we got the, we got the fork.

1601
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,120
So we're going to give it to the mayor,

1602
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,160
and then we're going to go to the spray paint guy,

1603
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,480
which is like left, right, basically.

1604
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,040
Or is it right, right?

1605
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,320
I think it may be right, right, right.

1606
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,280
Here's your fork.

1607
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,480
Oh, sorry, just...

1608
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,320
Right, four pronged spear will come in handy,

1609
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,600
all according to plan.

1610
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,160
Anyway, Annie has been telling me about this

1611
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,520
goop with strange property over in the forgotten forest.

1612
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,400
I want it.

1613
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,840
No, you can't eat it.

1614
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,120
Go get me some of that goop.

1615
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,920
I don't care what you have to do to get it.

1616
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,640
Okay, I guess, right, I guess.

1617
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,400
That's where the spray paint guy is.

1618
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:58,800
The bonk.

1619
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,280
Oh, sorry.

1620
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,320
Oh, frickin' dude.

1621
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,600
My only thing is, by default,

1622
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,920
I would say that X should be the action,

1623
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,240
but X is the menu change.

1624
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,680
That's why I keep rolling into the snails

1625
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,720
thinking I'm whacking them.

1626
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,400
But honestly, no, not big deal.

1627
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,080
Okay, right, you spray paint, let's go.

1628
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,000
Thanks, dude.

1629
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,640
Take this.

1630
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,480
Come back later if you want to see my work.

1631
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,480
I got to get in the zone.

1632
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:26,800
Oh.

1633
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,560
So you just give me extra heart.

1634
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,600
You don't give me...

1635
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,560
Is this the deep four?

1636
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,720
Is it the, oh, maybe that hatch.

1637
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,280
You know that?

1638
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,160
I guess the hatch.

1639
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,840
I think it's the hatch.

1640
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,080
Shove the fish where?

1641
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,080
I am the fish.

1642
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,800
Wait a minute, I am the fish.

1643
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,920
Okay, I can't go in here.

1644
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,680
Can you get me in there?

1645
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,440
I think the new method of babysitting is working.

1646
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,200
Oh, I feel like the mirror is setting up for something illegal.

1647
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,120
It's the mirror, the baddie.

1648
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,160
I think the mirror is actually technically the baddie

1649
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,920
in that video game that everyone plays.

1650
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,720
Starter Valley.

1651
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,480
And he told me to go to the forest, didn't he?

1652
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,800
Northwest.

1653
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,200
Wait, where am I?

1654
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,120
Oh, whoops.

1655
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,240
I just discovered, I was just trying to enter it.

1656
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,280
I waited a month for this update and all I got was this loosey hat.

1657
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,600
Oh my, oh my God.

1658
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:38,080
Reefling you with a freaking green hat is adorable.

1659
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,680
Oh my God, just cute.

1660
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:40,960
You're so cute.

1661
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:42,880
Come in handy.

1662
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,200
Anyway, Annie's been telling me about the strange properties

1663
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,480
in the Forgotten Forest.

1664
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,320
Was that not in the Forgotten Forest?

1665
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,880
North, weapons, woods, right.

1666
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,080
Forgotten Forest is somewhere else.

1667
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:54,640
Hold on.

1668
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,000
I think it might be below.

1669
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,000
It was like blocked off down the yard.

1670
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,040
It was blocked off.

1671
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,320
Yeah, there, there, like down there.

1672
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,160
Surely, copy them.

1673
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,040
Surely, copy them.

1674
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,360
No, no, the JoJo market, guys, that.

1675
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,800
Forgotten Forest is west.

1676
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,520
Okay, okay.

1677
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,360
I do love a good signpost, honestly.

1678
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,760
So I guess this guy's not here.

1679
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,800
No, he's still here.

1680
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,040
Icicle.

1681
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,040
No berries.

1682
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:22,160
Hi.

1683
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,240
Hi readers.

1684
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,520
Hi snowberries.

1685
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,080
Have you watched ACC's Samar yet?

1686
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,520
Did you get time to watch it?

1687
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,600
Did you like ACC's new ASMR?

1688
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,440
Didn't she do fantastic?

1689
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,240
I think she did fantastic.

1690
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,800
Hello, turnip boy.

1691
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,440
Mm-hmm.

1692
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,280
Welcome to the Forgotten Forest,

1693
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,200
and as I like to call it home.

1694
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,680
Hi snowberries.

1695
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,880
Hi, I'm Rated.

1696
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,560
Hi, I'm Rated.

1697
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,640
Thank you for the reader.

1698
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,560
AC and hi snowberries.

1699
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,240
Please enjoy AC's newest ASMR

1700
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:59,600
if you haven't had a chance to look at it yet.

1701
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:06,480
Because I think AC did amazing in the roleplay.

1702
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,680
Okay, okay.

1703
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,560
Just because I edited it and put subtitles on it,

1704
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,600
AC did an amazing job, okay?

1705
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,560
I'm a simp for AC.

1706
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,440
What can I say?

1707
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,600
Not a ton of folk come over.

1708
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,000
Not a ton of folk come over here,

1709
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,520
but I've been studying this place

1710
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,520
for as long as I can remember.

1711
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,480
I've seen some very strange things in these woods.

1712
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,840
It might be dangerous,

1713
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,600
but there's a ton of clues.

1714
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,960
But who could it be?

1715
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,040
Meet me off ahead in my research facility.

1716
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,600
I can help you with the woofer mirror.

1717
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,360
Oh yeah.

1718
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,720
You love the scratches,

1719
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,000
doesn't she do an amazing job?

1720
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,720
I was subtitling it and I was like, oh yeah.

1721
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,480
Oh my God, there's like, oh!

1722
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,160
The bunnies are absurd.

1723
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,920
Sheebie, naughty sheebie.

1724
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,360
Spank sheebie.

1725
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,800
Bad sheebie.

1726
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,760
Bad sheebie.

1727
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,360
We are playing the tax evasion game,

1728
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,640
and it is the cutest thing ever,

1729
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,600
and I'm in love with it.

1730
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,600
The sheebie's getting...

1731
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,160
Oh, and we take HP damage going into the water,

1732
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,200
which kind of looks obvious.

1733
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,840
I was literally getting boxed out of my wazoo.

1734
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,640
You found Holly's phone.

1735
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,800
I changed the password.

1736
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,160
Lol, no.

1737
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,440
Right, I don't know who Holly is,

1738
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,480
but hopefully we'll find...

1739
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:21,920
Sheebie!

1740
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,880
Sheebie, naughty sheebie.

1741
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,600
Don't do that again.

1742
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,480
You're hurting me.

1743
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,840
I'm excited about the new ASMR.

1744
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,520
I'm going to listen to it before bed.

1745
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,800
Yes, it's very cute.

1746
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,680
It's very sweet.

1747
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,000
And I think you'll enjoy her last little sentence.

1748
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,360
It's the most adorable.

1749
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,480
I was, right, for any snowberries

1750
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,840
that don't want it spoiled,

1751
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,480
close your ears for, like, 50 seconds, okay?

1752
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,680
Close your little ear holes.

1753
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,960
So I wrote the script for AC,

1754
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,800
but you can literally hear her voice

1755
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,560
perk up right at the very end

1756
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,760
when she says her last sentence.

1757
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:58,720
That's all I'm going to say, right?

1758
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,160
Okay, you can open your ear holes again.

1759
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:00,560
Hello!

1760
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,880
Hi, eternal boy!

1761
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,960
Oh, welcome to my research facility.

1762
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,760
I've been studying the forest around here

1763
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,080
to try and learn more about our path.

1764
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,560
Not a ton is known about where we even live.

1765
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,280
And came from.

1766
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,000
It's insane.

1767
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,080
This is great, though.

1768
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,240
First in a year, Onion finds my research,

1769
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,720
and now he sends a new assistant.

1770
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,000
I need to perform some field research for him.

1771
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,720
Can you go up north from here?

1772
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,360
There's a mural I've been trying to get to,

1773
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,080
but I can't figure out how to get past the fence.

1774
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,760
I might be an explorer,

1775
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,920
but I don't like getting my hands dirty.

1776
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,120
I'm like, you dirty, dirty boy.

1777
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,920
If I can get there, can you doodle it for me?

1778
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,880
Uh, sure.

1779
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,400
Right, you're not going to hand me the key?

1780
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,320
You're going to hand me the key after, right?

1781
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,440
Okay, I'll see you later.

1782
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,800
She's watching your notes.

1783
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,560
I'm using Onion's funding.

1784
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,040
I was able to build a lab in this structure.

1785
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,760
What secret does this doop in the forest hold?

1786
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,880
It's radioactive?

1787
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,520
Reefling skull?

1788
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,160
That was a quick...

1789
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,600
La, la, la, la, la, la, I can't hear you.

1790
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,400
Okay, good, good, good.

1791
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,560
Oh, that's Dundoo.

1792
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,680
We're safe.

1793
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,480
Are you safe?

1794
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,240
Right, we're full health, so we don't need to do that.

1795
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,240
Get out of here!

1796
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,080
I went up, wanted for tax evasion, petty theft,

1797
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,720
indecent exposure, simping murder,

1798
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,560
disorderly conduct, trespassing,

1799
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,320
destruction of property, et cetera.

1800
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,640
Turn it, boy, $2 reward caution.

1801
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,320
He's armed and dangerous?

1802
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,000
No, I'm not.

1803
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:35,680
Stop it.

1804
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,840
Stop telling fibbers about me.

1805
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,520
I'm a hard-working turnip.

1806
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:41,680
My work...

1807
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,480
Oh, gamertip.

1808
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,400
Did you know you can water through fences?

1809
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,600
Now you're a pro gamer.

1810
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,120
Is this teleport?

1811
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,040
Oh my God, it's portal!

1812
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,560
Right, sheebie, you're getting a spank.

1813
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,600
Stop it, sheebie.

1814
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,640
Stop being so angry.

1815
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,280
I must spank you, sheebie.

1816
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,640
Don't think I won't do it.

1817
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,760
Bad sheebie.

1818
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,040
Bad sheebie, get spanked.

1819
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:06,640
Okay.

1820
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,920
I thought it would be at least worth

1821
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,960
five dollars.

1822
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,840
Not at the rate of fucking...

1823
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,680
Are you seeing the clipping program?

1824
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,760
Wait, why haven't they put a teleport?

1825
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,840
Oh, I...

1826
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,720
Je comprende.

1827
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,160
Je comprende.

1828
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:22,960
Je comprende.

1829
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,520
Désolé.

1830
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:24,320
Je comprende.

1831
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,080
And this one?

1832
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,200
And this one?

1833
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,640
Wait, no, idiot.

1834
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,600
Sorry, you didn't see that.

1835
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,000
How embarrassing.

1836
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,640
Oh my God.

1837
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,600
Okay, we have to do a little bit of thinking.

1838
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,320
Okay, I'm going to take the sword out

1839
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,360
because I don't trust this.

1840
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,320
I'm scared.

1841
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,560
No, dear girl.

1842
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,400
No, dear girl for gen two.

1843
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,440
Back off.

1844
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,200
I'm getting my ass kicked right now.

1845
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:03,920
Back off.

1846
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:05,600
Back off.

1847
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,320
No, dear girl.

1848
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,040
Bad.

1849
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,360
Bad.

1850
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,200
Don't do that again.

1851
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,160
Almost perished.

1852
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,160
Sorry, I need a scavenge for health.

1853
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,800
Okay, there we go.

1854
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,360
We're better.

1855
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,560
Oh, I squiddled.

1856
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,120
Whoa, I found this.

1857
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,320
A mural doodle.

1858
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,440
Someone drew a giant...

1859
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:24,480
A mushroom giant.

1860
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,080
So handsome.

1861
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:26,720
So cute.

1862
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,440
Okay, that's the deer.

1863
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,720
Right, the deer doesn't respawn.

1864
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,200
We're safe.

1865
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,120
Apparently I never subbed to you.

1866
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,400
Just want to say A.C. A.S.M.I.R.

1867
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,520
Uploaded at the perfect time.

1868
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,640
Okay, oh, I'm so glad.

1869
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:37,840
I thought...

1870
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,880
Right, so obviously I don't want to stress her out.

1871
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:41,920
You know, she recorded it.

1872
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,120
I, you know, did it.

1873
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,360
I decided that I would put it up two hours

1874
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,480
before she streams.

1875
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,520
So for the snowberries that are kind of

1876
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,480
just waiting for her to stream,

1877
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,000
it would pass the time a bit more.

1878
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,360
You can listen into the background

1879
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,960
or you can wait for it to be a later

1880
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,800
and you can listen to that night type thing.

1881
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,240
But especially if you're European

1882
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,400
because A.C. streams quite late for Europeans.

1883
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,880
Like she goes to sleep

1884
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,560
pretty close after the end of streaming

1885
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,200
all that jazz.

1886
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,520
I had a lot of fun editing that

1887
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,880
and she had a lot of fun recording it

1888
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,600
as far as I'm aware.

1889
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,200
I mean, she sounded like she was having fun.

1890
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,200
No, dear girl, just fell to my knees in Walmart.

1891
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,640
No, you didn't.

1892
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,160
We're not having a fucking,

1893
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,160
a fucking four-legged Beecherbird.

1894
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,760
Get out of here.

1895
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,640
I'm not having a four-legged Beecherbird.

1896
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,200
You're dear fucking arses and shit.

1897
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,320
Yeah, it was past time working on stuff

1898
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,760
and these are made out a bit less than I am.

1899
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,520
Yeah, that's the thing.

1900
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,120
A.C. is very excited to do more role-play ASMRs,

1901
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,560
which is fantastic because,

1902
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,840
you know, she's a hard-working bean.

1903
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,000
You got it.

1904
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,080
I forgot what voice I've given.

1905
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,000
I think I've given her like three billion voices

1906
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,880
at this point.

1907
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,360
Fuck it.

1908
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,200
She's Jessie from Pokemon.

1909
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,240
You got it.

1910
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,160
Great work, my trusty field research assistant.

1911
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,600
This is very intriguing.

1912
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,640
I've known about the legends of the mushroom giants.

1913
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,600
It seems kind of hocus pocus at first,

1914
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,640
but I gather that they've been a part of our history

1915
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,720
for a very long time.

1916
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,480
I'm going to need more information

1917
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,720
before I jump to conclusions, though,

1918
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,560
but I will jump on that fucking cock of yours.

1919
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,240
And that's where you come in.

1920
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:39,120
Take this key and head south.

1921
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,720
I've heard there's an ancient turnip patch down that way

1922
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,960
that I haven't been able to find.

1923
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,400
See what you can gather from the locals there

1924
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,680
if you can find it.

1925
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,520
You're a very smart and well-behaved boy.

1926
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,960
I do love when they follow instructions.

1927
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,280
Wow.

1928
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,080
Can you give me the key, please?

1929
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,000
Well, you didn't give me it.

1930
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,200
You're just holding on to it.

1931
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,040
Give me the goddamn key.

1932
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,840
Okay, let's just take our time to explore.

1933
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:13,440
A few more enemies.

1934
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,400
Shabby, stop it.

1935
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,280
Stop being annoyed.

1936
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,000
Stop it, Shabby.

1937
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,440
Damn it.

1938
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,240
You're getting spanked.

1939
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,880
I thought Stronny has been far in this whole time,

1940
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,240
but it was the text.

1941
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,240
You thought I was brapping my arse cheeks

1942
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,320
for an hour and 14 minutes straight.

1943
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,200
A reflin.

1944
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,360
You thought I was brapping away.

1945
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:44,720
A reflin.

1946
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,600
You're getting an absolute spanking for that one.

1947
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,400
Bend over.

1948
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,440
I thought I was like proudly brapping away.

1949
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,760
You're so done.

1950
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,800
You're actually so done.

1951
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,720
You're in so much trouble after a comment like that.

1952
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,080
Oh, I do like that.

1953
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:03,920
Frostina.

1954
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,560
On the note of waiting for your streamer going online,

1955
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,320
I finally got around to watch the giveaway, SMR.

1956
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,080
All I can say is thank you.

1957
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,160
And you liked it?

1958
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,880
Oh my god, I had so much fun making it.

1959
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,960
I'm so glad you liked it.

1960
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,080
It was so freaking fun.

1961
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,040
I enjoyed it.

1962
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,440
I'm so glad you enjoyed it, Frostina.

1963
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,000
Thank you for the tip as well.

1964
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,160
I had a lot of fun making it.

1965
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,040
I know the concept seems like a shitpost,

1966
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,960
but I thoroughly enjoyed doing, like, creating it.

1967
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,360
I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do right now.

1968
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,880
Oh, it's supposed to be.

1969
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,200
No way I did that in one.

1970
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:55,920
I'm so smart.

1971
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,040
Sorry, but I'm actually so smart.

1972
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,040
I'm actually so smart.

1973
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,720
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

1974
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,760
I have like 100 IQ.

1975
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,960
Sorry, I don't know why.

1976
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:05,440
I just do.

1977
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:07,600
So scary though.

1978
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,560
I'm getting my weapon out.

1979
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,280
I thought it was super wholesome.

1980
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,560
Bruh, I'm so excited.

1981
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,600
Whoa, I found this.

1982
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,560
A turnip.

1983
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,520
Where's its face?

1984
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,720
Why isn't it moving?

1985
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,480
Oh no.

1986
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,600
Shibby, stop it.

1987
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,720
You scared me.

1988
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,680
I didn't see you.

1989
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,400
All right, is this like a...

1990
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,880
I don't know if I'm supposed to do that later.

1991
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,440
I'll come back.

1992
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:31,920
I'll come back.

1993
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,840
This needs to be some sort of access point here.

1994
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,280
Let's just access that.

1995
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,320
There's an IQ mummy.

1996
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,240
Literally, sorry, this game's a 10 out of 10.

1997
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:38,720
Just like...

1998
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,760
Um, no?

1999
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:51,360
What?

2000
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,520
Okay, what?

2001
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,760
How am I supposed to get any wax in?

2002
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:02,400
Go home.

2003
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:05,840
Go home.

2004
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,400
Go home.

2005
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,080
Stop it.

2006
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:10,960
Oh my god, I'm actually...

2007
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,280
Why is it so big?

2008
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,480
Why was it so big?

2009
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:28,400
Okay, well, I found this.

2010
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,800
A potted petal portal.

2011
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,200
Use it to spawn a petal portal.

2012
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:33,600
Okay.

2013
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,080
Okay.

2014
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,440
Please no more big deer.

2015
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,800
That's what she said.

2016
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,440
It is so big for no reason.

2017
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,360
Okay, so we can now spawn her.

2018
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,280
Well, like this?

2019
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:57,920
Okay.

2020
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,160
Right.

2021
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:58,560
Okay.

2022
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:58,720
Okay.

2023
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:58,800
Okay.

2024
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,040
Okay.

2025
01:17:59,040 --> 01:17:59,200
Okay.

2026
01:17:59,200 --> 01:17:59,360
Okay.

2027
01:17:59,360 --> 01:17:59,760
Okay.

2028
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:00,960
Sheebie!

2029
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,200
You're scaring me, sheepsters.

2030
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,520
Right.

2031
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,240
If we need to...

2032
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:19,280
I need to put it here to here to get the water in can.

2033
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:20,480
And kick it to the lift.

2034
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,280
Oh my god, I'm so smart.

2035
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,240
I'm such a smart girl.

2036
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,120
What the fuck?

2037
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,640
I'm creaming.

2038
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,560
I actually feel like I have some IQ right now.

2039
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,040
Did we finish everything I had to do there?

2040
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,080
I don't know.

2041
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:37,440
Hi.

2042
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:37,920
Did...

2043
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,560
Have we finished?

2044
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,560
Oh, Mush, I don't understand.

2045
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,960
It's like you, but not aware.

2046
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,240
I'm so sorry, Turner.

2047
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,920
Boy, these adventures have become a bit more morbid than I anticipated.

2048
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,160
We really need to get to the bottom of this.

2049
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,480
We need to see how this all connects.

2050
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,080
Here's my last key.

2051
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,520
Take it and go west.

2052
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,680
I feel our answers will lie there.

2053
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,640
Right, hold on.

2054
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,960
We need to get rid of these in the way.

2055
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,760
And then I need to put a portal down.

2056
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,320
And then I need to sprinkle some water.

2057
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,920
Then I need to come up...

2058
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,040
No, shit.

2059
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,600
And then I need to do this so I can come back and then open this.

2060
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,600
And we'll take my weapon out because I don't trust it.

2061
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,640
They found an unsentient Turner.

2062
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:29,920
They're killing me.

2063
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,520
Oh no, Refling, you threw up.

2064
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,320
Refling, no, you threw up.

2065
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,200
It's fine.

2066
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,240
I'm live.

2067
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,520
It's not pre-recorded.

2068
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,800
I promise, Refling.

2069
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,920
Don't throw up.

2070
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,600
No, don't throw up.

2071
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,040
Mommy.

2072
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,040
Oh, where?

2073
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,440
What am I?

2074
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,160
What is this gift into you?

2075
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,120
Oh no, my babies are throwing up.

2076
01:19:58,720 --> 01:19:59,840
I think I fell.

2077
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:03,920
I crawled out of that goop, but I don't know nothing now.

2078
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:04,880
Goop.

2079
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,000
Okay.

2080
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:07,440
What about you?

2081
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:09,680
My head hurts.

2082
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,000
There's a lot of noise past me.

2083
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,760
Right.

2084
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,200
It seems dangerous.

2085
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,040
Okay.

2086
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,080
I've got my sword.

2087
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,520
I think I know what our next boss fight is.

2088
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,400
Stag, accrual.

2089
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,480
Why is it so big?

2090
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,240
Can I spank it?

2091
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:33,120
Fuck you, bitch.

2092
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:33,920
Oh, I can.

2093
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,440
Right, we're just going for the spank method.

2094
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,160
Sorry, but we're doing...

2095
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,120
Oh, sheebies!

2096
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,360
Don't get attacked, teamed by sheebies!

2097
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,080
I can't.

2098
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,720
Okay, okay.

2099
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:45,280
It's fine.

2100
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:45,840
It's fine.

2101
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,200
Okay, there's a heart here.

2102
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,960
You get back here so I can reach you.

2103
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,480
Bad sheevee.

2104
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:51,280
Spank sheevee.

2105
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,520
I didn't know I could freaking throw stuff on me.

2106
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:04,320
I'm guessing the bombs are a hell of a lot more effective than this.

2107
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,040
I don't really know what we're supposed to do.

2108
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,040
Well, there's more sheebies.

2109
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,640
Stop!

2110
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,480
Oh, my God, I'm getting tagged, teamed.

2111
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,440
I'm actually getting shagged.

2112
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,240
I'm actually getting shagged.

2113
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,840
I think I need to spank it when it comes across,

2114
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,800
so it's like all I can do.

2115
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,440
Unless I sacrifice HP on purpose.

2116
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,040
Yeah, okay, maybe let's not do that.

2117
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,280
Nice try, but let's not do that.

2118
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:26,480
Ow!

2119
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,440
Are you squidding me right now?

2120
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,400
Okay, spank?

2121
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,040
No, I missed.

2122
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,440
Do a flip on stream or it's prerecorded.

2123
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,800
Do a flip on stream if it's prerecorded.

2124
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,200
I'm in a boss fight, tiny spany.

2125
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,240
What do you mean?

2126
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,720
I don't have fucking...

2127
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,760
I mean, I think this is like the best I can do.

2128
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,720
I just wallop it with my wee sword.

2129
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,120
Oh, then when it respawns sheevees, they'll drop me HP.

2130
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,440
Yeah, okay, I think that's it.

2131
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,040
I'm just gonna wallop it with my sword.

2132
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,320
Okay, no, stop.

2133
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,080
Stop.

2134
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,360
No, don't charge.

2135
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,160
I'll be mad.

2136
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,720
Not mad.

2137
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,280
I'm raging.

2138
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,040
Right, stand there and just take it like a good,

2139
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,320
good little deer girl for gen four.

2140
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,800
Take it like a good little deer girl.

2141
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,000
That's right.

2142
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,960
Get an absolute spanking you.

2143
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:23,520
Yeah, that's right.

2144
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,560
I'm spanking you.

2145
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,360
So, I know.

2146
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,080
Okay, don't do that.

2147
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,600
Ow, she...

2148
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,920
Oh my god, sheevees actually really good at this game.

2149
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,120
A little burpee.

2150
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,480
Right, come here.

2151
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,800
I need it to let...

2152
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah, okay, stand there and take it like a good little deer.

2153
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,480
That's right.

2154
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,400
I'm sacrificing my HP to beat you up.

2155
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,400
That's right.

2156
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,680
Oh my god, I love this game.

2157
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,440
Deer four.

2158
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,640
Wait, Stronny didn't flip.

2159
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,920
It's so pre-recorded.

2160
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:50,320
Stand.

2161
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,520
Because people are gonna believe you.

2162
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,160
That's the...

2163
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:55,680
That's the dangerous part.

2164
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:56,960
Fruit heart.

2165
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,320
This fruit gives you another heart.

2166
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:58,960
Nifty.

2167
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,400
Okay.

2168
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,400
Okay, now what?

2169
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,040
I guess we done though?

2170
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,920
Bold move, first try.

2171
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,040
We have seven heart containers.

2172
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:11,360
Oh!

2173
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,840
Whoa, I found this green goop.

2174
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,440
It feels kind of strange touching this.

2175
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,040
Why does Mayor Onion want it?

2176
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:18,640
I don't know.

2177
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,480
If it stops me from having to pay taxes,

2178
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,000
he can get what he wants.

2179
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:26,080
Because I...

2180
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,840
I don't care who the IRS sends.

2181
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,440
I am not paying the taxes.

2182
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,880
Mummy is pre-recorded.

2183
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:33,600
It's true of it.

2184
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,200
Oh, I got a little in a thief.

2185
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,040
Now she's radioactive.

2186
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,040
Double the horn dog.

2187
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,520
Oh, he's on a little...

2188
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,800
Why are you being sacrificed?

2189
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,600
Oh, sorry.

2190
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,280
I must own real estate.

2191
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,520
I have leaf.

2192
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,600
Please get me real estate, turnip.

2193
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:53,120
What?

2194
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,080
I found a form of payment for the real estate agent.

2195
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,320
What?

2196
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,720
I guess I need to go talk to the real estate agent.

2197
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:03,520
Wow, turnip.

2198
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,640
Boy, you're glowing.

2199
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,280
No, not in the beautiful way.

2200
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,120
More in the concerning way.

2201
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,760
It seems like everything around you is coming to life.

2202
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,240
Also, the goop has a face?

2203
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,400
Is it a veggie or an animal?

2204
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,920
It doesn't look like either.

2205
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:24,000
What?

2206
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,400
You met a bunch of talking acorns?

2207
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,920
I thought acorns were just tree seeds.

2208
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,720
The goop, the turnip, the mushroom giant?

2209
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,920
Maybe this is the key to our evolution.

2210
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,320
Maybe the mushroom giants made this goop to give us life.

2211
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,400
I need to prepare a report on our findings to Mayor Onion.

2212
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,320
This is groundbreaking information.

2213
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,120
Thank you for all your help, turnip boy.

2214
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,920
I wanted you to have this.

2215
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,480
You're a true field researcher now.

2216
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,360
Explorers, huh?

2217
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,440
I'm a real field researcher now.

2218
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,560
Ah, yeah.

2219
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,200
Let's go.

2220
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,440
Okay, let's go back to the mayor

2221
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,600
because I think we need to talk to the real estate agent now.

2222
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,080
Wait, is this the way I came?

2223
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,320
No, it kind of is.

2224
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,640
I like this reward real true.

2225
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,680
Is this the way I came?

2226
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,760
Oh, I'm getting a bit confuzzled now, but that's okay.

2227
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:27,840
Okay, yeah, okay.

2228
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:28,720
This is the way to go.

2229
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,800
Right, go to the mayor, give him the goop.

2230
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,200
Go to the real estate agent.

2231
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,560
Give her a leaf, see what happens.

2232
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,000
And then he'll claim his little acorn.

2233
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,240
Nice joining, hi chat.

2234
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:42,800
Hi, people.

2235
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,720
You're currently committing to Activation,

2236
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,600
just like you should know.

2237
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,520
We're avoiding all responsibilities.

2238
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,240
So does Mummy want more goop from this huge mushroom?

2239
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,680
Oh my God, that's so good.

2240
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,200
Wait, it's only trying to make me attach to the avocado.

2241
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,200
What, you want to run an avocado?

2242
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,240
It'll give you the good stuff.

2243
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,240
Oh yes, it's all coming together.

2244
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,280
FYI, glowing isn't covered in your health insurance.

2245
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,160
It's weird though.

2246
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,400
It feels like you're creating life around you.

2247
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,440
Next, we need a contraption

2248
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,000
that your pea-sized brain couldn't even comprehend.

2249
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,440
It's a machine that shoots a red laser.

2250
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,960
It's some high-tech stuff.

2251
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,440
It's called a laser pointer for short.

2252
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,560
There's a strange hatch in weapons,

2253
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,800
which I feel like you could find one in there.

2254
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,680
Yeah.

2255
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,200
I sent the IRS to investigate.

2256
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,160
Hopefully those dinkuses came up with a solution

2257
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,240
when I get inside.

2258
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,040
But while I'm at it, I'm going to the real estate agent

2259
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,800
because this acorn wants a hoose.

2260
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:53,920
Hello.

2261
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,560
No, wait, you're another real estate agent.

2262
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,480
Hi, real estate agent.

2263
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,760
Hello, you found me a client.

2264
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,560
All they had for a budget is elite.

2265
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,440
That's not exactly currency.

2266
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,800
Well, the economy really has sunk, hasn't it?

2267
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,080
Here, do you mind taking this then?

2268
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,280
Do you mind taking them then?

2269
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,320
I can sell them a thought they're standing on.

2270
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,520
Real estate letter.

2271
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,760
It's a leaf worth of land.

2272
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,360
Okay, yeah, sure, and I'll give them my house.

2273
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:32,640
Right, we're going to...

2274
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,000
Oh, I literally, I'm glowing.

2275
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:34,800
I just noticed that.

2276
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,480
I thought they were all just saying that for funsies.

2277
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,560
No, I'm literally irradiated right now.

2278
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,160
Ipsy, oh wait.

2279
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,200
Am I supposed to put the cat here?

2280
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,680
You found a sword.

2281
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,920
Either way, we shouldn't be the ones doing this weird.

2282
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,520
Is there tax money even going?

2283
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:50,720
Politicians, am I right?

2284
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,800
Wait until I tell you about what an abyssalman is.

2285
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,840
Are you ready?

2286
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:02,320
Remember how there's that contract for a one single lane to be opened up in America?

2287
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:07,280
And the contract was priced at 310 million US dollars?

2288
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:13,520
Are those dollars going to the workers that are put in the roads and the road

2289
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,200
are put in the tarmac then?

2290
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:17,760
Of course not.

2291
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,840
That's what an abyssalman is called.

2292
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,240
People are giving contracts to each other all the time.

2293
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,800
It literally happened with COVID in the UK.

2294
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:31,120
Richie Snack and all his wee pals got all these billions of fucking contracts and fucking

2295
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,120
great British pounds.

2296
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,280
And then everyone was like, that's not worth it.

2297
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,640
That's not this, that's not that.

2298
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,080
Yeah, it's called abyssalman.

2299
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,840
Okay, thank Tarnett.

2300
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,600
Can you read for me?

2301
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:42,080
I cannot.

2302
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,840
You own real estate.

2303
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,120
You also own property tax.

2304
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,240
No property tax for you.

2305
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,120
Is that how you read?

2306
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,960
Sometimes.

2307
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,280
Nice.

2308
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,000
Now get off my property.

2309
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:54,960
Sorry.

2310
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,000
Gosh, she's so smart and hot.

2311
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:05,200
I came across a TikTok that was talking about it and everyone was like, the road

2312
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,800
isn't worth that much.

2313
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,840
What's going on?

2314
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,560
And I'm like, you guys don't know what an abyssalman is?

2315
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:16,000
Like, there was so many comments that had no comprehension about what an abyssalman is.

2316
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,800
I was already farting everyone's eyelashes.

2317
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,960
Like, how can you not know what an abyssalman is?

2318
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:25,520
So I'm going to do a tinfoil hat stream because I need to, I need, I need to teach

2319
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,920
the masses what the fuck goes on in, you know, because it's not clicking.

2320
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,400
Okay.

2321
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,360
I know you don't get taught it on purpose, but holy fuck.

2322
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,640
Holy fuck, holy fuck.

2323
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,200
Right, okay.

2324
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,160
Let's go to the, we, the hat, okay.

2325
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:41,760
We're playing dead by daylight right now.

2326
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,640
We're going to the hat.

2327
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:44,800
Can we get in?

2328
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:45,120
Okay.

2329
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,320
Hi guys.

2330
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,040
What's the deal?

2331
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,840
Hello, Tarnett boy.

2332
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,080
Bunker closed tight.

2333
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,280
I used my muscles.

2334
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:55,920
No success.

2335
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,120
We call touch at grim graveyard.

2336
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,560
Maybe he has tool.

2337
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,040
Goodbye.

2338
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:02,320
Goodbye.

2339
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:02,560
Okay.

2340
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,600
We go to the graveyard.

2341
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,040
Thanks for the listen.

2342
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:07,760
She's so smart.

2343
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,120
I want to drown in her clams.

2344
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:09,760
Stop.

2345
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,280
Should I order or work it out?

2346
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,800
You guys send me memes and marshmallow to like keep me up to date with everything because

2347
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,560
I'm not, I don't, I don't always have time to keep up the date with everything.

2348
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,880
And one of them was like, oh, she's so smart.

2349
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:23,920
I want to drown in her.

2350
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,280
Okay.

2351
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:25,760
Hello.

2352
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,280
I think I'm doing your quest next.

2353
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:29,760
All right, kid.

2354
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,120
What do you want from me?

2355
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,280
The IRS called and told me to help boy Tarnett.

2356
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,600
And I'm going to assume that's you.

2357
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:40,880
My shovel.

2358
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,640
Why I make a living with this darn thing.

2359
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,200
All right.

2360
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:47,600
Fine.

2361
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,240
If you want it so bad, you're going to have to work for it.

2362
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,120
There's some rich folk buried deep in this graveyard.

2363
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,120
Help me find them and I'll give you my shovel.

2364
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,960
I never said I made a living with a strong set of weight with grave robin.

2365
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,480
If you're set in, let's get going.

2366
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,600
Let's get going because no one's.

2367
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,120
Oh my God.

2368
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,400
It's Emmy.

2369
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,360
Hi, Emmy.

2370
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,640
I can't do any boys.

2371
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,880
Go to where the trees rot or you'll return to the pot.

2372
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,360
What?

2373
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,520
Go to where the trees rot or you'll return to the bottom.

2374
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,320
Like you'll leave.

2375
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:24,880
It's a riddle.

2376
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,360
Okay.

2377
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,480
The trees rot.

2378
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,840
Well, there's rotten trees at that archway.

2379
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:36,480
What?

2380
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:43,040
Kid, why are you looking at me with that confused look on your dumb face?

2381
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,520
When in doubt, just start digging.

2382
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,680
You won't believe what these idiots are buried.

2383
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,040
You don't need the shovel for that.

2384
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,720
You have a perfectly good sword.

2385
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,760
I think we're, I think we're grave robin.

2386
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,040
An ironic.

2387
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,120
Whoa.

2388
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:01,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2389
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:07,680
Stop it.

2390
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,640
Okay.

2391
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,120
Yeah.

2392
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,280
I'm not surprised we're getting haunted for grave robin.

2393
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:13,840
Going to be honest.

2394
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:20,000
Uh, am I the only one that gets a song of storm waves from this background?

2395
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:25,680
Okay.

2396
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,400
What's your advice?

2397
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:31,600
The direction to go that's the best will reigns with best.

2398
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,000
Listen, man.

2399
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,760
It's hard to come up with good riddles.

2400
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:36,080
Where?

2401
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:41,680
North, east, west, surely it's west.

2402
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:42,880
Sure.

2403
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:43,840
Okay.

2404
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,640
So I just, I had a little bit of doubt.

2405
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:46,880
Okay.

2406
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:47,840
I had a little bit of doubt.

2407
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:48,800
I had a bit of doubt.

2408
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,840
I'm, I'm special.

2409
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:50,080
Okay.

2410
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,040
I was like, does east reign with best?

2411
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,240
But does it?

2412
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,200
Or is it like an American accent thing?

2413
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:03,680
Maybe I'm just overthinking it.

2414
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,160
I'm sorry.

2415
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:05,440
I'm sorry.

2416
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,160
Please forgive me.

2417
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:10,080
Oh, hi.

2418
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:16,000
Unless you want to join me below, seek the truth where it's yellow.

2419
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:17,920
Bug off, dude.

2420
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,640
It almost rhymes.

2421
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:23,120
I rip it up.

2422
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,000
Hey, mom and dad.

2423
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I don't know why I'm writing when you're six feet under,

2424
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,560
but I just want to say thanks for leaving the farmland to me.

2425
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,000
It's a great place to raise kids.

2426
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,320
Is that real?

2427
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,360
Honestly though, couldn't have paid the debt off before you passed the taxes are insane.

2428
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,680
I guess those are just developers because there's no way to put like actual wings in it.

2429
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,760
That's rather strange.

2430
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,600
I assume yellow is below, right?

2431
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,640
Seek the truth where, if you want me to join below.

2432
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,520
Oh, I thought you said weas.

2433
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,680
It's so funny.

2434
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,320
What?

2435
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:03,680
All right.

2436
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,720
Dead trees.

2437
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,080
West.

2438
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:10,000
It's the yellow flowers.

2439
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,720
Oh, okay.

2440
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:13,200
Sorry.

2441
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,760
Sorry.

2442
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,160
Sorry.

2443
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:17,280
It's the yellow flower.

2444
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,000
Sorry.

2445
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,800
This area seems to have the remains of humans.

2446
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,320
Everything that's left behind warps our technology and ability.

2447
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,880
So the shoo, I'm so sorry.

2448
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,280
If you want to be right, you better get out of my sight.

2449
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,240
I'm not trying to be mean.

2450
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,880
It's the riddle.

2451
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,560
Okay.

2452
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:38,000
I guess we use the teleport one.

2453
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,560
But that teleport hardly laugh.

2454
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,000
If you want to be right, get out of my sight.

2455
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:47,680
Wait.

2456
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,800
Oh, I'm going to have to push Sun through here.

2457
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,200
Hold on.

2458
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:54,640
Okay.

2459
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:00,800
Okay.

2460
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:01,280
Hold on.

2461
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:01,600
Hold on.

2462
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,000
I actually have to use my brain mildly for this one.

2463
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,200
Oh, shit.

2464
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:06,720
No.

2465
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:10,960
Hold on.

2466
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:11,520
Hold on.

2467
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,000
Hold on.

2468
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:13,760
I'm not very smart.

2469
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:15,600
Hold on.

2470
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,240
Hold on.

2471
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,800
If the portal could last like five seconds longer, that would genuinely be appreciated.

2472
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,240
Okay.

2473
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,000
I assume it's going to be right because...

2474
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,680
Because why wouldn't it be?

2475
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,320
Okay.

2476
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,600
This is a good one.

2477
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,640
I think only one of these pumpkins is completely honest.

2478
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:38,160
The rest seem like they're lying about the duration and who they believe is a liar.

2479
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:40,720
My brain hurts.

2480
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:41,600
Just figure it out.

2481
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,080
Oh, no.

2482
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,800
You should go west.

2483
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,880
All the pumpkins on my right are lying.

2484
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,280
You should go north.

2485
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,200
All the pumpkins on my right is lying.

2486
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,560
You should go east.

2487
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:55,360
All the pumpkins.

2488
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:55,840
Follow me.

2489
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:56,800
I'm telling the truth.

2490
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,560
You should go south.

2491
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,920
All the pumpkins.

2492
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:02,480
Follow me.

2493
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,440
I'm telling the truth.

2494
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,040
What?

2495
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:07,760
You should go south.

2496
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,760
Oh, no.

2497
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,640
That's not happening.

2498
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,120
We flinch.

2499
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,000
What's the answer?

2500
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:12,640
That's not...

2501
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,800
It's 5 a.m.

2502
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,400
5 a.m.

2503
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,200
What one is it?

2504
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,920
It's all...

2505
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,400
Oh, sorry.

2506
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,200
I didn't see the ghost.

2507
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:23,600
That's right.

2508
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,320
I'm Grave Robyn.

2509
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,040
What are you going to do about it?

2510
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,760
Don't tell her.

2511
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,400
Don't make me...

2512
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,480
I will just fucking...

2513
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,760
I will stun Locke right now.

2514
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,320
It's 8 p.m.

2515
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,240
You need to do the last one.

2516
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,360
Talk to the last one?

2517
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,880
The one that's face...

2518
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:41,200
Oh.

2519
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,200
You should go south.

2520
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,680
Also, the pumpkin above me is telling the truth.

2521
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,360
You should go east.

2522
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:53,520
What?

2523
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,000
I don't...

2524
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,920
Can't do it without the last pumpkin.

2525
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,280
There's a pumpkin you haven't talked to.

2526
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,120
You should go west.

2527
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,640
Also, the pumpkin above me is lying.

2528
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:11,120
I don't know how you're supposed to do the process of elimination thing with these.

2529
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,280
You should go...

2530
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:15,760
If only one is telling the truth,

2531
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,720
then any statement claiming that the other is telling the truth cannot be...

2532
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:20,480
The only...

2533
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,360
So, the one that says...

2534
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,040
Truth.

2535
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:25,440
Truth.

2536
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,920
So, there's only one that says lying.

2537
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,480
So, the bot middle is the correct one.

2538
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,320
Oh no, he says lying too.

2539
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,760
The pumpkin on my right is lying.

2540
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,360
The pumpkin above me is lying.

2541
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,640
You should go south.

2542
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,440
Also, the reefling above me is telling the truth.

2543
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,400
Stop.

2544
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,120
I swear, if I'm doing a maze because of you guys.

2545
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,680
Reefling!

2546
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,120
Mods!

2547
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,080
Mods, time out that reefling.

2548
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,920
I fucking believed you!

2549
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,920
I believed you!

2550
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,040
Reefling!

2551
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,040
I've already forgotten which way is which!

2552
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:11,440
Reefling!

2553
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,160
You know I'm not smart enough for this stuff!

2554
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,280
Stop teasing me!

2555
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,520
You're fucking teasing me!

2556
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,720
Right, we went south.

2557
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:25,680
It's not south.

2558
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,920
So, we're just gonna go north.

2559
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:28,960
The pumpkin is it.

2560
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:30,080
Another one is telling the truth.

2561
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,120
Mine is south and east.

2562
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,400
So, I think you're meant to go north.

2563
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:36,000
Okay, you're lucky.

2564
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,320
You're lucky.

2565
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,000
I got a shovel.

2566
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,720
Can I pick up?

2567
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,560
Oh snap, kiddo!

2568
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,920
We've struck the mother load!

2569
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,480
Now that I have a brand new shiny shovel,

2570
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,000
I guess you don't need this honka-junk.

2571
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,400
Take this.

2572
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:54,480
I'll get rid of the gross soil for you for your charge.

2573
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,840
I found the shovel!

2574
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,600
A mighty weapon, hints harder,

2575
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,200
and can pry open bunkers.

2576
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,280
Are you gonna be fine, okay?

2577
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:01,920
Are you okay?

2578
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:02,560
No secrets?

2579
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,400
No little cheeky secrets?

2580
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:05,440
No?

2581
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,240
Okay.

2582
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,520
All right, I'll see you later, I'll get you.

2583
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,360
You should go east.

2584
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,600
Also, the reefling who said south is right.

2585
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,240
So, I guess I'll just push me back to the start.

2586
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,320
Okay, I've got the shovel.

2587
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,920
We can pry open the bunker now.

2588
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,160
Check the graves for secrets.

2589
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:22,960
SHIT!

2590
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,520
Fuck!

2591
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,440
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2592
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,560
Hold on, right.

2593
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,240
Um, what was it?

2594
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:33,120
Dead trees.

2595
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,040
A little to the left.

2596
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,240
And then the flowers.

2597
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,040
And then the teleport.

2598
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,160
And then, was it north?

2599
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,720
I think it was north.

2600
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,040
Okay, and then we're gonna beat up the graves.

2601
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,720
Oh, a little heart, some stuff.

2602
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,920
I'm digging a grave.

2603
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,200
Diggy diggy grave.

2604
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:09,360
I'm being a grave.

2605
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,840
Oh my god, the shovel's so much stronger than the sword.

2606
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,720
It only takes...

2607
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:13,520
Oh, I never saw him.

2608
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,240
Oh, I never saw him.

2609
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,040
I'm getting walloped by a freaking phantom.

2610
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:17,760
The phantom.

2611
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,680
To say ghost in French, you say phantom.

2612
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:23,520
Bunk.

2613
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:23,920
Bunk.

2614
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:24,880
Bunk.

2615
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:26,320
Bunk.

2616
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:28,560
Oh, there's no bonus.

2617
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:30,320
Bunk.

2618
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,800
Oh, I got my hearts back.

2619
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:34,720
Sure you don't want to give me that shovel?

2620
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,200
Didn't check the graves in the first area.

2621
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:44,800
And I just...

2622
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,200
All reflings are liars.

2623
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,200
Also, any statement I say is false.

2624
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,360
Stop, because I literally can't do that stuff.

2625
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,000
Wait, I very quickly checked the graves here.

2626
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,200
And just build it.

2627
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:55,840
I'm just...

2628
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,480
I'm just doing dead bodies, right?

2629
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,360
Let's not...

2630
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:00,640
We'll leave the dead bodies alone.

2631
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,480
Forget about the graves.

2632
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,440
Forgot about the graves in the second area.

2633
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,000
A mint phantom.

2634
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,520
I hear the phantom in French means ghost.

2635
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:16,080
Right, fine.

2636
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,600
We'll do the second area.

2637
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,160
And if nothing happens, you're all getting bent over many...

2638
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,360
Right, no, dead trees.

2639
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:25,360
Okay.

2640
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,440
I'm getting trolled by you guys.

2641
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,160
I'm just digging up dead bodies.

2642
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,240
I have no respect for the dead right now.

2643
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,560
You know, it's like really bad.

2644
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,080
Now, you guys are trolls!

2645
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,440
Why are you trolling me?

2646
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,400
There's nothing here.

2647
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,440
It's the one you did first.

2648
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,440
Slam Girl for Gen 2 also to tell in the truth.

2649
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2650
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,040
It's the one you did first.

2651
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,240
World domination is going great.

2652
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,040
It's the one on the right, trust.

2653
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:11,840
Please spank it.

2654
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,640
Are you trolled?

2655
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,840
Am I getting trolled or not?

2656
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,480
I can't tell.

2657
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,400
Have you guys played this game before?

2658
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,120
I feel like I'm getting mildly trolled right now.

2659
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,120
The second zone was the first one you dug.

2660
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:24,080
It's time to leave.

2661
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,440
Right, yous are getting spanked.

2662
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,440
Just just bent over.

2663
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,040
Are you squiddin' me right now?

2664
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,120
Mini carrot?

2665
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,120
Uh, is that a paradox?

2666
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,480
The Pinocchio paradox?

2667
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,120
Thank you for the super chat.

2668
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,120
Um, I don't know what you're talking about.

2669
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

2670
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

2671
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,120
I don't know what you're talking about.

2672
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

2673
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:50,720
I don't...

2674
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:54,720
I think that's a paradoxical one, is it not?

2675
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,720
What the?

2676
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,720
Right, head against side.

2677
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:00,720
Okay.

2678
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,720
Really, he would explode?

2679
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,720
Interact.

2680
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,720
What should you do in a radio-stain form?

2681
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,720
Stay prepared. Bunker up, stand side.

2682
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,720
Stay tuned. Why would I rip that up?

2683
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,720
Fuck it!

2684
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:14,720
Doomsday, you tore up a nuclear hazard and from...

2685
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,720
Humans?

2686
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:20,720
Humans?

2687
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,720
Humans?

2688
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:30,720
There's humans in this game?

2689
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,720
Humans.

2690
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,720
I'm just a little reefling.

2691
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,720
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

2692
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:44,720
Ow!

2693
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,720
Can I ward myself? Jesus.

2694
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:50,720
Human, come back!

2695
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:52,720
Human, no, don't lock yourself away!

2696
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,720
Human, please.

2697
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,720
I'm a nice person.

2698
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,720
Interact.

2699
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,720
Bombs drop. We're gonna stop the virus.

2700
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,720
Tax day postpone.

2701
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:04,720
Fuck this!

2702
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,720
News boy, you ripped up an old newspaper.

2703
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:08,720
News boy.

2704
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
Okay.

2705
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:20,720
We have a key.

2706
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:22,720
Are we actually gonna see?

2707
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:24,720
I'm not gonna hurt you. Burn the house down, honestly.

2708
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,720
I see it.

2709
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,720
I'm spanking it.

2710
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:30,720
I'm spanking it.

2711
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,720
Whoa! My controls are inverted!

2712
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,720
Oh my god, my controls are inverted.

2713
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,720
What the heck?

2714
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:40,720
I'm not... I do not have the brain capacity for that.

2715
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:42,720
So, what's this?

2716
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,720
I've been so bored down here.

2717
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:46,720
We stocked up on everything about entertainment.

2718
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:48,720
So, we've been watching the same few movies on repeat forever.

2719
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,720
Ooh, that would be rough.

2720
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,720
That would be rough.

2721
01:44:54,720 --> 01:44:56,720
Right, we need to make a fire.

2722
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,720
Oops, sorry.

2723
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:00,720
We go like this, this, this,

2724
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,720
and then we burn it

2725
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,720
and we take a step back because I don't want to get hurt.

2726
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,720
And I'll let him burn it.

2727
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,720
Okay.

2728
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:12,720
Whoa!

2729
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:14,720
Stop it, I saw that!

2730
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,720
I brought the cupboard.

2731
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,720
Oh, I'm bringing things to life, dumbass!

2732
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:20,720
I'm bringing things to life.

2733
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,720
Your diary, what's profit?

2734
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:24,720
It's Liz again!

2735
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,720
It's what, day 1000?

2736
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:28,720
What, four years?

2737
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,720
I thought we would be back home.

2738
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,720
My family's driving me crazy.

2739
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:34,720
I feel like you're the only one I can open up to.

2740
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,720
I really miss Matt. I was hoping when all this over gets home,

2741
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:38,720
he'd come back to normal.

2742
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:40,720
See you tomorrow, diary.

2743
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,720
Whoa! This is like getting a bit real, I think.

2744
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:44,720
Honestly, I don't know.

2745
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,720
Right, well, water it, but I don't know if it's going to catch.

2746
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:48,720
Ow! Oh my God, I have to...

2747
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,720
Ow, ow, ow!

2748
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:52,720
Stop.

2749
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,720
Did I have to catch myself on fire for this?

2750
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,720
Oh my God, I do!

2751
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:58,720
Ow, ow, ow! Stop!

2752
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,720
How's Matt's suit?

2753
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,720
Can't protect me from many things, including fire.

2754
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,720
Okay.

2755
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,720
Thank you because I'm getting wrecked and decked

2756
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,720
and shh, wrecked.

2757
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,720
Did I need to ward this?

2758
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,720
Turn away.

2759
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,720
Hopefully we'll get some health soon,

2760
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,720
but apparently I'm not going to be on fire all the time.

2761
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:22,720
Oh my God, it's doing the reverse thing.

2762
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,720
Stop with your hypnosis. I'm the hypnosis.

2763
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,720
One, okay.

2764
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:28,720
Stop it!

2765
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,720
I'm the hypnosis one.

2766
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:32,720
Oh my God, I'm actually going to die in this game.

2767
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,720
I think I'm going to have to back it.

2768
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:36,720
Stop!

2769
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,720
It keeps putting me backwards.

2770
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,720
I think I'm going to have to keep coming back in and out

2771
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,720
to spawn the health.

2772
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,720
No!

2773
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,720
No, no, no, no, no!

2774
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,720
Why did you put the fucking backwards one

2775
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,720
right next to it, bro?

2776
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,720
I swear if I lost all that progress.

2777
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,720
No, I didn't. Okay, it's fine.

2778
01:46:56,720 --> 01:46:58,720
First death, honestly.

2779
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,720
I hate this game. Sorry.

2780
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:02,720
It's going to zero out ten.

2781
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,720
Virginia, that's to me. I'm so embarrassed.

2782
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:06,720
Wait, I thought I had a hazmat suit on.

2783
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:08,720
What the fuck?

2784
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,720
Okay.

2785
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,720
Wait, hold on. Let me check my inventory.

2786
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,720
No, I do have the hazmat suit.

2787
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,720
So things shouldn't be

2788
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,720
freaking doing that. Stop it.

2789
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,720
Wait, hold on, hold on. I got this.

2790
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,720
Oh no, I need to destroy them.

2791
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,720
Oh my God, please. He's right there.

2792
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:40,720
Please.

2793
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,720
Right there.

2794
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,720
I can handle this one. That's fine.

2795
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,720
Okay.

2796
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:50,720
Is it easier

2797
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,720
just to burn myself?

2798
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,720
I know that sounds crazy, but...

2799
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,720
I think that's what the game wants me to do.

2800
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:02,720
Oh, wait. I can burn myself without...

2801
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:04,720
Okay, okay. I can burn myself

2802
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,720
without taking damage. Got it.

2803
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,720
Got it. Got it.

2804
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,720
I understand.

2805
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,720
Okay, sorry, I love this game again.

2806
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:18,720
Sorry, I love this game.

2807
01:48:20,720 --> 01:48:22,720
Then you set myself on fire.

2808
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,720
I don't think I've ever had the puzzle

2809
01:48:24,720 --> 01:48:26,720
be like, yeah, nuke yourself.

2810
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,720
Okay.

2811
01:48:28,720 --> 01:48:30,720
Quit the suit. You haven't put it on.

2812
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,720
The suit is on.

2813
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,720
Like, it doesn't display.

2814
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,720
Dad left the bunker last week

2815
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,720
to scout what's been happening above.

2816
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,720
I don't know what he saw, but he hasn't been the same since.

2817
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,720
He saw fruit?

2818
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,720
We're in a radioactive world, look.

2819
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,720
Stop!

2820
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,720
Eh?

2821
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:00,720
Um...

2822
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,720
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2823
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:04,720
no, no, no, this stuff creeps me out.

2824
01:49:04,720 --> 01:49:06,720
This stuff creeps me out. Nope, nope, nope.

2825
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:08,720
We're not doing this.

2826
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:10,720
Burn me!

2827
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,720
Burn me!

2828
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,720
No!

2829
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:16,720
Um...

2830
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:18,720
Oh my god, I can't do the long-arm stuff.

2831
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,720
Oh my god, it freaks me out.

2832
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,720
It freaks me out. I can't...

2833
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:24,720
Put me on fire. Put me on fire.

2834
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,720
Is it working? Her HP is going down,

2835
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,720
but my HP is going down too.

2836
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,720
Stop touching me.

2837
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,720
Stop touching me.

2838
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,720
Stop it.

2839
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,720
I don't want...

2840
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,720
Oh god, no.

2841
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,720
Ow, no, I'm dead. Holy crap, I don't know what to do.

2842
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,720
The best second is

2843
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:46,720
literally just keep myself on fire.

2844
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,720
No, can you maybe put me on fire?

2845
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,720
What the fuck is this boss fight?

2846
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,720
And there's no...

2847
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,720
Okay, so it is to like

2848
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,720
put her on fire. Hold on.

2849
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,720
I don't... Sorry, I wasn't quite

2850
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,720
comprehending what I was supposed to do. Let's try that again.

2851
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,720
Shouldn't the suit protect you from radiation?

2852
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,720
Mutated girl for Gen 2.

2853
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,720
Right, let's try that again.

2854
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,720
Maybe avoid getting hit by the fifth?

2855
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,720
So I just lighter on fire?

2856
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,720
I think... Right.

2857
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,720
There. Okay, she's on fire.

2858
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,720
And... Okay, that's fine.

2859
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,720
No, that's not fine.

2860
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,720
Can you put me on fire please?

2861
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,720
And then hit her with the fire. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2862
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:46,720
I just needed a bit of

2863
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,720
a bit of like, uh, what does the game want

2864
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,720
for me, you know?

2865
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,720
There we go. Okay, she did.

2866
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,720
She walloped me. She got me good there.

2867
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,720
I'll admit it, you got me good.

2868
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,720
Right, so when she pukes, I can't actually

2869
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:00,720
really, you know, do anything with it.

2870
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:02,720
I can put on fire.

2871
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,720
Okay.

2872
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,720
Right, okay.

2873
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:14,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2874
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:16,720
That was a much better attempt. I'm not really sure

2875
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:18,720
how you do that hit list, but sure.

2876
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,720
No, I'll pick up. I'll pick up.

2877
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,720
Heart fruit. Very happy with that.

2878
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,720
Not gonna complain.

2879
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,720
Hey.

2880
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,720
What can I like, pry their bunker open?

2881
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,720
I guess not.

2882
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:36,720
He's done it hit list.

2883
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:38,720
Strony irradiated and kills the child, but she's

2884
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:40,720
a laser pointer.

2885
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,720
She shoots a red laser beam.

2886
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,720
Fancy stuff.

2887
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:46,720
I miss Grom. He was the best cat I've ever had.

2888
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,720
I can't stand to look at his little toys.

2889
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,720
The laser pointer was his favorite. Aw, is it me

2890
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,720
putters this toy?

2891
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:54,720
Right.

2892
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,720
So I guess we can go in there?

2893
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:04,720
No, I guess not.

2894
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:06,720
Hmm.

2895
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,720
Ha.

2896
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,720
Ha, ha, ha.

2897
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,720
Okay, that was a

2898
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:16,720
interesting little tidbit.

2899
01:52:16,720 --> 01:52:18,720
So humans

2900
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:20,720
actually live in this world and exist in

2901
01:52:20,720 --> 01:52:22,720
this world.

2902
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,720
It definitely

2903
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:28,720
changed the tone a bit.

2904
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,720
I'm starting it for bud.

2905
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,720
Trying to pry the door open.

2906
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,720
I'm just like, excuse me, I would like to talk.

2907
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,720
I'm just a little turnip.

2908
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,720
Hello.

2909
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,720
Dear Dyr, after being in this bunker

2910
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:46,720
so long, I've gotten so clear. I can't wait to see the sun again.

2911
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:48,720
You found hair dye.

2912
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:50,720
Can make leaves blue, a hot commodity

2913
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,720
amongst barbers.

2914
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,720
I know who to give that to.

2915
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,720
I know who to give that to.

2916
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,720
Do da, do da.

2917
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:02,720
I know who to give that to.

2918
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:08,720
Okay, that was a very

2919
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,720
interesting

2920
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,720
story.

2921
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,720
Now I'm a sucker

2922
01:53:16,720 --> 01:53:18,720
for a radiation and fallout

2923
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,720
story. So I have to admit, I'm very sucked

2924
01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:22,720
into the plot right now.

2925
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,720
Okay, I've got your laser pointer.

2926
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,720
Yes, the laser pointer. The final piece

2927
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,720
of my master plan.

2928
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,720
You really thought I was going to give you the D to your green?

2929
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:34,720
Yes.

2930
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,720
I don't know how to laugh like that.

2931
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,720
You really are an idiot just like father.

2932
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,720
Do you even know what's even under

2933
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:46,720
your own home?

2934
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:48,720
This is pathetic.

2935
01:53:52,720 --> 01:53:54,720
Get on my side, I bet the

2936
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:56,720
infamous old man lemon won't help you there.

2937
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:58,720
Go to my house, you bam.

2938
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,720
Go to my house.

2939
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,720
Right, I'm giving the barber

2940
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,720
his dye, okay.

2941
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,720
The evil mirror was evil.

2942
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,720
Interact.

2943
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:12,720
Ooh, you with that intrusive hair cut.

2944
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:14,720
Do you have a hair dye?

2945
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:16,720
Thank you, fine sir.

2946
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:18,720
I must repair your good deed.

2947
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:20,720
Do not worry, the great Edgar

2948
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:22,720
shall fix that monstrosity

2949
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,720
of a Jew.

2950
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,720
He's oars, just cut it all off.

2951
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:28,720
Oh my god, mercy's in the game.

2952
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,720
Oh no, I think...

2953
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,720
I mean, I can still...

2954
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:40,720
Yeah, I can work with that.

2955
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,720
Can you hear me right now?

2956
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,720
Oh, did it?

2957
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,720
I completely like glossed over that.

2958
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,720
Stash power, thank you for the super chat.

2959
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,720
I completely like didn't

2960
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,720
think either.

2961
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,720
Hello chat.

2962
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,720
Well, yes, it's time to tell you the truth.

2963
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,720
Your father,

2964
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:08,720
Daunton,

2965
01:55:08,720 --> 01:55:10,720
Mayor Onion and I go way back.

2966
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:12,720
We used to run

2967
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:14,720
in the same crime family.

2968
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,720
We were all mobsters.

2969
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:18,720
Your father was the boss.

2970
01:55:18,720 --> 01:55:20,720
I was hit, man.

2971
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:22,720
Mayor Onion was the consigliary.

2972
01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:24,720
Consigliary.

2973
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:26,720
What?

2974
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,720
Consigliary.

2975
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:30,720
Well, that's some French piss I've never seen in my life.

2976
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:32,720
Emmy, translate please.

2977
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:34,720
Consigliary.

2978
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36,720
It sounds like a piece of pasta.

2979
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:38,720
Alright.

2980
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:40,720
Our society

2981
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,720
is chaotic.

2982
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,720
We have no laws.

2983
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,720
No one in charge.

2984
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:48,720
It was a perfect time to take control,

2985
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:50,720
but we had our disagreements.

2986
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:52,720
Mayor Onion got filled with greed.

2987
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:54,720
He had his own beliefs on how

2988
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,720
the town should be ran.

2989
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:58,720
We thought he was just a bit

2990
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:00,720
of a quack. We didn't think

2991
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,720
he would take it this far.

2992
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,720
We formed a government, turning

2993
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,720
us and dragging our names in the dirt.

2994
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,720
Huh?

2995
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:10,720
He wanted what we have

2996
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:12,720
in our base.

2997
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,720
Hello. Weapons.

2998
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,720
Wealth. You name it. We had it.

2999
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,720
Huh?

3000
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,720
I believed that

3001
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:22,720
he would go to great lengths.

3002
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:24,720
I always thought your father's death was

3003
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,720
suspicious.

3004
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,720
Hmm.

3005
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,720
You thought this was about your greenhouse?

3006
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:32,720
Sonny, there's a massive base

3007
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:34,720
underneath it.

3008
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:36,720
Hmm.

3009
01:56:36,720 --> 01:56:38,720
You must go now. Sneaking

3010
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,720
and defeat Mayor Onion.

3011
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,720
There's not much time.

3012
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,720
Ehhh.

3013
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:46,720
You can use my secret hatch behind this tree.

3014
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,720
But be quick.

3015
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:50,720
We are pissed. There's a time.

3016
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:52,720
Hold on. I need a hydration check.

3017
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,720
The voices are killing me a bit. Hydration

3018
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,720
replays. I think we're about to do the

3019
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:58,720
boss fight.

3020
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,720
Uh, how badly am I

3021
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,720
going to mess up this boss fight?

3022
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:08,720
Be honest.

3023
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:10,720
I'm coming at them while

3024
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,720
my bowl is headed in.

3025
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:14,720
Mysterious

3026
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:16,720
Mafia base.

3027
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,720
Ooh.

3028
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,720
Oh, there's trash.

3029
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:22,720
I mean, it makes sense that we

3030
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:24,720
use it trash.

3031
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:26,720
Right, why doesn't it be on fire?

3032
01:57:26,720 --> 01:57:28,720
What?

3033
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:30,720
I can't get there in time.

3034
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,720
Maybe another time.

3035
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,720
Basic English for big dum-dum

3036
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:38,720
tax addition.

3037
01:57:38,720 --> 01:57:40,720
You destroyed the book that taught

3038
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:42,720
everyone how to speak.

3039
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,720
Oops.

3040
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:48,720
Us veggies learn right, we big brain.

3041
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,720
Ah, no!

3042
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,720
Is that our first word?

3043
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:54,720
Oopsies.

3044
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,720
I'm not sure if we still got that.

3045
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,720
Oh, I need to

3046
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,720
I need to teleport.

3047
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,720
Oh my god, I need to teleport.

3048
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,720
I don't know if I can do this in time.

3049
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,720
Oh my god, I can, right.

3050
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,720
I have to admit, they really do not

3051
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:12,720
give you much time for those portals.

3052
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,720
Right.

3053
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:26,720
Sorry, my brain's kind of

3054
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:28,720
short circuiting right now.

3055
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,720
I'm like, oh, sorry.

3056
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,720
If I do that, okay, that'll do.

3057
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,720
Right, and then

3058
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,720
I get into the teleport thing.

3059
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:38,720
Bonk.

3060
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:40,720
And then

3061
01:58:40,720 --> 01:58:42,720
bonk.

3062
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:44,720
And then bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

3063
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:46,720
All done.

3064
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:50,720
Oh shit, it's all puzzles.

3065
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:52,720
What was in the other room?

3066
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,720
Hold on, hold on.

3067
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,720
Let me try the other room first.

3068
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,720
Cause...

3069
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:04,720
Interact.

3070
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:06,720
B2.

3071
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:12,720
Interact.

3072
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,720
The layers to the onion.

3073
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:16,720
The mirror onion manifest.

3074
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,720
Get it out of here.

3075
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,720
What even is the point of the mafia?

3076
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:22,720
I want wealth and these deadbeats

3077
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:24,720
aren't going to get me. I've been learning

3078
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,720
about the humans and their government.

3079
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,720
Perhaps I will make more or maybe I can convince Dawn.

3080
01:59:28,720 --> 01:59:30,720
Wait, it's all puzzles always has been.

3081
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,720
I accidentally played the puzzle game.

3082
01:59:32,720 --> 01:59:34,720
He's lost the headless, charred,

3083
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,720
pickled gang.

3084
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,720
Great. General grapefruit.

3085
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:40,720
My wife, J.K. Lowell.

3086
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:42,720
What? My wife.

3087
01:59:42,720 --> 01:59:44,720
My wife.

3088
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,720
Okay, let's go down again.

3089
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,720
Where is this? I think maybe we need to wait.

3090
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:58,720
According to her research, whatever

3091
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:00,720
being lived on the planet before us were destroyed

3092
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,720
by these devices, we need to dismantle this

3093
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:04,720
if we want to protect our future.

3094
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:06,720
I'll have onion do it, Dawn.

3095
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:08,720
That's how my daddy died.

3096
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:12,720
Oh my god.

3097
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:14,720
It was all

3098
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:16,720
mirror onion's fault.

3099
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,720
We have learned the lore.

3100
02:00:18,720 --> 02:00:20,720
We must explore now.

3101
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:24,720
They weren't lying about having weapons

3102
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,720
under the damn house.

3103
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:28,720
Okay, let's see

3104
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:30,720
what I'm supposed to do over here.

3105
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:34,720
That looks like a nuke.

3106
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:44,720
Great.

3107
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:46,720
Let's just

3108
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,720
fucking go where we can.

3109
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:50,720
Oh, interact.

3110
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:52,720
My survival. Oh no!

3111
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:54,720
My surviving son.

3112
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:56,720
If you read this, I've probably been rotten for a while now.

3113
02:00:56,720 --> 02:00:58,720
I've lest this state to you, but I fear

3114
02:00:58,720 --> 02:01:00,720
mirror onion's retaliation. Please do protect yourself.

3115
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,720
And the

3116
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,720
Ternichino

3117
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,720
land is all up to you now. I'm sorry

3118
02:01:06,720 --> 02:01:08,720
that I couldn't be there to witness your second leaf.

3119
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,720
Oh!

3120
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:12,720
Or for when you held your first watering can,

3121
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,720
I'll miss you, son. You'll be the biggest gangster

3122
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,720
of us all. I know you'll make the

3123
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:18,720
Ternichino name proud.

3124
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:20,720
P.S., destroy this letter. I don't want the IRS

3125
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:22,720
to see this. Love you, Dawn.

3126
02:01:22,720 --> 02:01:24,720
Oh my dad.

3127
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,720
Thank you for the letter, dad.

3128
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,720
I now have closure.

3129
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:30,720
You ripped up a letter from your dad.

3130
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:32,720
Bruh, this is...

3131
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,720
Wait, is that my family?

3132
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,720
Stop! Oh my god, it's me!

3133
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,720
That's so funny that they've pixelated

3134
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,720
the pictures on it.

3135
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,720
Right, I have closure from my dad now.

3136
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,720
I understand.

3137
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:50,720
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

3138
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,720
No, I don't understand.

3139
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:56,720
Right. Hold on.

3140
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:58,720
Wait, hold on. I need to kick the bomb

3141
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,720
upwards.

3142
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,720
So, I need to do this.

3143
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:04,720
Then I need to do this.

3144
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:06,720
And then quickly jump down.

3145
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,720
Do that. And then up!

3146
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:10,720
Okay.

3147
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:12,720
And then do it again.

3148
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,720
Oh my god. Up, up, up, up, up, up!

3149
02:02:16,720 --> 02:02:18,720
Quick, quick! Okay.

3150
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:20,720
Oh shit. Wait, what?

3151
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,720
Ugh!

3152
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,720
Oh shit.

3153
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,720
Oh, I need to destroy it.

3154
02:02:28,720 --> 02:02:30,720
You're meant to destroy the Sith,

3155
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:32,720
not join it!

3156
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,720
You underestimated my power.

3157
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,720
Don't try it, anything.

3158
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:42,720
Anyway, that's my recap of Star Wars.

3159
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:44,720
If you want that to know.

3160
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:48,720
Why does it keep shoving it there?

3161
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:52,720
Oh my god, I'm going to fart in its mouth!

3162
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,720
Alright, I'm going to let the portal

3163
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,720
time out, okay?

3164
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:58,720
No, this is pod racing.

3165
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:00,720
I want to do it.

3166
02:03:00,720 --> 02:03:02,720
Right, I guess I'll put it here.

3167
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:06,720
You almost got it.

3168
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:08,720
Unironically...

3169
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:10,720
Oh wait, I need to destroy it.

3170
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,720
Unironically, a little to the left.

3171
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,720
And then go up.

3172
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:18,720
Let me come up too.

3173
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:22,720
You're such a liar!

3174
02:03:22,720 --> 02:03:24,720
Out my way!

3175
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:26,720
No, you're such a liar, honestly.

3176
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:30,720
Not here.

3177
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,720
Yeah, do that.

3178
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,720
Oh wait, I don't need to destroy it.

3179
02:03:36,720 --> 02:03:38,720
Oh my god, we did it!

3180
02:03:38,720 --> 02:03:40,720
Oh hell yeah!

3181
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:42,720
You can't hold me back.

3182
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,720
I'm coming to avenge my father.

3183
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:48,720
You think you're a wise guy, huh?

3184
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:52,720
Did you get any success?

3185
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:54,720
Wackum, you idiot radishes!

3186
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:56,720
No, leave me alone!

3187
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:58,720
Sorry, I just walked into them.

3188
02:03:58,720 --> 02:04:00,720
Enough!

3189
02:04:00,720 --> 02:04:02,720
What the...

3190
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:04,720
You stupid baba ganoush!

3191
02:04:04,720 --> 02:04:06,720
That's just so one battery yet is!

3192
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:10,720
That's it, I'm sick of your garbage.

3193
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:12,720
You'll be sleeping with a rot in the night.

3194
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:16,720
Corrupt political powers.

3195
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,720
Transform!

3196
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:22,720
Eh?

3197
02:04:22,720 --> 02:04:24,720
Corruption onion.

3198
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:32,720
I can't even hit him.

3199
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:34,720
Okay, one hit.

3200
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,720
Ow!

3201
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:38,720
How did I drop bombs on him?

3202
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:40,720
Did I not even have access to any bombs or anything?

3203
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:44,720
Every time he does a...

3204
02:04:48,720 --> 02:04:50,720
I got stuck in the corner!

3205
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:52,720
Ow!

3206
02:04:58,720 --> 02:05:00,720
I don't know if I should just go for a whack

3207
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:02,720
every time he does an attack.

3208
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:06,720
I don't know.

3209
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:08,720
Okay, we can hit two whacks.

3210
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,720
Oh no no no!

3211
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,720
We can get two whacks in when he does a move.

3212
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,720
One, two.

3213
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,720
Run away.

3214
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:18,720
And then...

3215
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:20,720
Two...

3216
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,720
Oh!

3217
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:24,720
He threw up, he did.

3218
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,720
Okay, okay, okay.

3219
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:28,720
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

3220
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:30,720
Let's try that again, let's try that again.

3221
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:32,720
Elden Ring boss, right?

3222
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:34,720
You think...

3223
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:36,720
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.

3224
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:38,720
Yes, yes, yes.

3225
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:40,720
Red storm!

3226
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:42,720
Okay, let's try again, let's try again, let's try again.

3227
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:44,720
Roll, use those...

3228
02:05:44,720 --> 02:05:46,720
Use those eye frames real untrue.

3229
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:48,720
Corruption, onion.

3230
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:50,720
Okay, let him...

3231
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:52,720
Whack.

3232
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,720
Oh for fuck's sake!

3233
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:56,720
I'm stuck in...

3234
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:58,720
That wouldn't have happened

3235
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,720
if their controls weren't B for interact.

3236
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:02,720
I wouldn't have got stuck there.

3237
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:06,720
I can't believe that I'm losing to a pixel game.

3238
02:06:10,720 --> 02:06:12,720
Can I hit him? Oh I can!

3239
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:14,720
You can get a few extra whacks

3240
02:06:14,720 --> 02:06:16,720
and get lucky with the leader.

3241
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:18,720
One, and two.

3242
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,720
Okay, close enough.

3243
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:22,720
Unfortunate stealth, one.

3244
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:24,720
Oh shit, that was really obvious, I shouldn't have done that.

3245
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:26,720
Sorry.

3246
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,720
One, two, three.

3247
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,720
And four, and then he attacks.

3248
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:32,720
Ow, he hit me.

3249
02:06:32,720 --> 02:06:34,720
Stop it, I'm supposed to hit you.

3250
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:36,720
Stop it.

3251
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:40,720
Okay, and one, two.

3252
02:06:40,720 --> 02:06:42,720
Close enough.

3253
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:44,720
One, ow.

3254
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:46,720
One, two, three.

3255
02:06:46,720 --> 02:06:48,720
How could this happen?

3256
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,720
How was I bestowed by the...

3257
02:06:52,720 --> 02:06:54,720
How was I bested? Sorry.

3258
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,720
How was I bested by the son of my rival?

3259
02:06:56,720 --> 02:06:58,720
He might have defeated me,

3260
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:00,720
but the government will live on

3261
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:02,720
through the documentary mess.

3262
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:04,720
Oh shit, really?

3263
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,720
Oh!

3264
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:14,720
How many ha-has are there?

3265
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:16,720
Right, we did it.

3266
02:07:16,720 --> 02:07:18,720
Shit.

3267
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,720
You committed tax evasion, achievement unlocked.

3268
02:07:20,720 --> 02:07:22,720
I cannot laugh for that long.

3269
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,720
How did I miss any documents?

3270
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,720
I've got everything.

3271
02:07:28,720 --> 02:07:30,720
Property deed, the greenhouse owned by Turnip Boy.

3272
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:32,720
Enough!

3273
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:34,720
You ripped up your own deed of homeowner.

3274
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:38,720
That was so cute.

3275
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:40,720
Amazing voice acting, did you like it?

3276
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,720
With us.

3277
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:44,720
We gathered here to say farewell.

3278
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:46,720
We'll go next along.

3279
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,720
So, sing along.

3280
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:50,720
Or don't.

3281
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:52,720
Do you?

3282
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,720
Sing along.

3283
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:12,720
Little adventure through the land.

3284
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:14,720
Take down mayor onion.

3285
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,720
Always leave your plans.

3286
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:18,720
We won't pay our taxes.

3287
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:20,720
We've got rent and we've got bills.

3288
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:22,720
Those layers...

3289
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:24,720
I wish they gave you lyrics.

3290
02:08:24,720 --> 02:08:26,720
I could have sang along.

3291
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:30,720
Little adventure through the land.

3292
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,720
Take down mayor onion.

3293
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:34,720
Always leave your plans.

3294
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:36,720
Spend some time peeling back

3295
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:38,720
those skins in your finder.

3296
02:08:38,720 --> 02:08:40,720
Soon there are seeds with

3297
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:42,720
and we'll sing

3298
02:08:42,720 --> 02:08:44,720
our hearts out loud.

3299
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:46,720
We'll spin because the worst

3300
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,720
parts pass

3301
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:50,720
we're breathing still.

3302
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:52,720
So we'll fight

3303
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:54,720
through the woods.

3304
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:56,720
The violence of history

3305
02:08:56,720 --> 02:08:58,720
we're speaking in ethos.

3306
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:00,720
The secret is to try

3307
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,720
doing good.

3308
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:04,720
People snails alone.

3309
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,720
They got problems of their own.

3310
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:08,720
Make your mark.

3311
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,720
Cause it's time.

3312
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:12,720
Always lose.

3313
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:14,720
Wasted for a paste of

3314
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:16,720
friends and family make up.

3315
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,720
Fertile or that heart.

3316
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:20,720
Fertile or that heart.

3317
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:22,720
Fertile or that heart.

3318
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,720
Fertile or that heart.

3319
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:26,720
You need to sing this in the next track, ok?

3320
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:28,720
You played the sequel?

3321
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:30,720
There's a sequel?

3322
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:32,720
I would definitely play the sequel.

3323
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,720
Fertile or that heart.

3324
02:09:34,720 --> 02:10:03,720
We rob a bank, do we?

3325
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:07,720
Oh my god, that's so good.

3326
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:27,720
Oh, what a nice ending message to the family.

3327
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:36,720
There was a big dev team, but I guess it was one guy.

3328
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:38,720
There's more to the game.

3329
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:39,720
I think the end?

3330
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:40,720
Question mark?

3331
02:10:40,720 --> 02:10:41,720
I don't know.

3332
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:45,720
Well, we go explore those areas that were stuck.

3333
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:48,720
I took a dinner break and it's the end credit.

3334
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:50,720
No, no, there's more.

3335
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:56,720
Okay, let me turn it down again because I have to turn it up for that singing section.

3336
02:10:56,720 --> 02:11:00,720
Wait, turn it down for the actual gameplay section.

3337
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:01,720
All aboard!

3338
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:03,720
Sunset station has finally been constructed.

3339
02:11:03,720 --> 02:11:05,720
Check your mailbox.

3340
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:09,720
Dimensional disruptions have been occurring in a cave in Rocky Brant.

3341
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:11,720
Maybe go check it out.

3342
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:12,720
Limitless line.

3343
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:14,720
I'm a serious train checker.

3344
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:16,720
I wonder where I can use it.

3345
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:21,720
Is this DLC?

3346
02:11:22,720 --> 02:11:26,720
The 100% speedrun for this game is 24 minutes.

3347
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:27,720
Eh!

3348
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:34,720
Is this DLC?

3349
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:36,720
Because I was hoping for...

3350
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:40,720
Is this a 2 over DLC mission thing?

3351
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:45,720
Or is this the true ending?

3352
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:46,720
How long is it?

3353
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:51,720
Because I purposely picked shorter games so I can get the background work.

3354
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:53,720
She didn't get the true ending.

3355
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:55,720
Should we come back to it then?

3356
02:11:55,720 --> 02:11:56,720
No, it's pretty short.

3357
02:11:56,720 --> 02:11:57,720
Okay, I'll come here.

3358
02:11:57,720 --> 02:11:59,720
Daily challenge.

3359
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:03,720
Hi, random people who are playing this game.

3360
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:04,720
It's short.

3361
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:05,720
Okay, okay, okay.

3362
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:06,720
I trust, I trust.

3363
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:07,720
Oh, sorry.

3364
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:09,720
All aboard!

3365
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:11,720
Depart and sunset station.

3366
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:12,720
Tickets, please.

3367
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:15,720
Oh, turn it, boys.

3368
02:12:15,720 --> 02:12:19,720
See, you got complimentary sunset station ticket in the mail.

3369
02:12:19,720 --> 02:12:24,720
It's named this because of the odd way this area always looks like the sun is setting.

3370
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:25,720
Ah.

3371
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:27,720
No loitering at the station now.

3372
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:29,720
It's time to get aboard.

3373
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:32,720
Get your stubs moving and let's get the show on the road.

3374
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:33,720
Okay.

3375
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:37,720
The limitless line.

3376
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:41,720
Oh, I'm supposed to spank everything.

3377
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:42,720
Okay.

3378
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,720
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3379
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:46,720
It's like a fighter.

3380
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:47,720
Oh, there's sheep.

3381
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:50,720
Oh my God, it's the Binding of Isaac.

3382
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:56,720
Can I make it to the end, is the question.

3383
02:12:56,720 --> 02:13:01,720
Even though the song literally said leave the snails alone, they've got problems of their own.

3384
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:03,720
The Binding of Turnips.

3385
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,720
Eat a ton of ferret.

3386
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:06,720
Wait, again?

3387
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:08,720
No.

3388
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:10,720
Spank, spank, spank.

3389
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:12,720
Turn into bacon right now.

3390
02:13:12,720 --> 02:13:14,720
Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon.

3391
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,720
Okay.

3392
02:13:15,720 --> 02:13:16,720
Bacon.

3393
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:18,720
We have bacon.

3394
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,720
You beat stuff up until you lose.

3395
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:22,720
It's basically Bostra.

3396
02:13:22,720 --> 02:13:23,720
Is it endless?

3397
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:25,720
So it doesn't matter.

3398
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,720
Good show.

3399
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:27,720
Eh?

3400
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:30,720
I'm sure you've noticed, but this is no ordinary train, buckle.

3401
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:31,720
Eh?

3402
02:13:31,720 --> 02:13:36,720
It's time for you to tap deep into your mafioso blood.

3403
02:13:36,720 --> 02:13:38,720
A mafioso must be resourceful.

3404
02:13:38,720 --> 02:13:39,720
They must be cunning.

3405
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:41,720
They must be charming.

3406
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:42,720
Hm?

3407
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,720
All things you don't possess.

3408
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:45,720
Excuse me.

3409
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:47,720
So we're here to work on it.

3410
02:13:47,720 --> 02:13:48,720
Hm.

3411
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:50,720
Here are some train-exclusive trinkets.

3412
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,720
Choose wisely.

3413
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:54,720
They could make or break your time on the limitless line.

3414
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:56,720
Increases your trip range.

3415
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:58,720
Makes you go zoom.

3416
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:01,720
Chances for enemies to explode on death.

3417
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:04,720
Is that dangerous to me?

3418
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:07,720
Fuck it, we'll take the explosion.

3419
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:10,720
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3420
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:11,720
Breta.

3421
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:12,720
Bre.

3422
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:14,720
Breta.

3423
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:15,720
Breta.

3424
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:17,720
Don't touch me like that.

3425
02:14:17,720 --> 02:14:20,720
I really cannot handle the long arm thing.

3426
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:23,720
Stop, and then give me another one.

3427
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:24,720
Stop it.

3428
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:26,720
Stop it.

3429
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,720
Okay, the explosion one definitely seems to be helping.

3430
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:32,720
It's just bending of Isaac's turnip.

3431
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:33,720
Stop.

3432
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:35,720
You stop it.

3433
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:36,720
Ow.

3434
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:38,720
Okay.

3435
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:44,720
Rotten cat apple has buttered toast.

3436
02:14:44,720 --> 02:14:46,720
No, you stop spinning right now.

3437
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:47,720
You're scaring me.

3438
02:14:47,720 --> 02:14:48,720
Stop it.

3439
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:49,720
You're scaring me.

3440
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:50,720
Spank.

3441
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:51,720
Spank.

3442
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:52,720
Spank.

3443
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:53,720
Spank.

3444
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:54,720
No.

3445
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,720
No.

3446
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:56,720
Stop it.

3447
02:14:56,720 --> 02:14:57,720
No.

3448
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:58,720
Naughty.

3449
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:00,720
You're not getting any catnip after dinner tonight.

3450
02:15:00,720 --> 02:15:01,720
Bad kitty.

3451
02:15:01,720 --> 02:15:02,720
Bad kitty.

3452
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:03,720
Bad kitty.

3453
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:04,720
Spank.

3454
02:15:04,720 --> 02:15:06,720
Spank, spank, spank, spank.

3455
02:15:07,720 --> 02:15:09,720
And I have two tickets.

3456
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:11,720
So, do I not need to do this bit?

3457
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:13,720
Is it a different bit I need to do?

3458
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:16,720
Good show.

3459
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:20,720
They say cats just have nine lines, but that's not necessarily true.

3460
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:21,720
Eh?

3461
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:22,720
Okay.

3462
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:24,720
Chance to not take damage.

3463
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:25,720
Increase trip.

3464
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:28,720
Chance for enemies to catch on fire when hit.

3465
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:35,720
Why would you need defensive everything's dying around you?

3466
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:38,720
Stop it.

3467
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:40,720
No, dear girl for Gen 4.

3468
02:15:40,720 --> 02:15:41,720
Stop it, Sheebie.

3469
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:44,720
I don't care if you want to slime girl, Sheebie.

3470
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:45,720
It's not happening.

3471
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:48,720
Stop.

3472
02:15:48,720 --> 02:15:49,720
Stop.

3473
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:50,720
Stop.

3474
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:51,720
Okay.

3475
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:52,720
Maybe I should have done the defense one.

3476
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:53,720
I don't know.

3477
02:15:53,720 --> 02:15:54,720
Okay.

3478
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:55,720
He caught on fire.

3479
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:56,720
Okay.

3480
02:15:56,720 --> 02:15:57,720
Okay.

3481
02:15:57,720 --> 02:15:58,720
Okay.

3482
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,720
Okay.

3483
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:00,720
Okay.

3484
02:16:00,720 --> 02:16:01,720
Okay.

3485
02:16:01,720 --> 02:16:02,720
Okay.

3486
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:03,720
Okay.

3487
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:04,720
Okay.

3488
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:05,720
Okay.

3489
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:06,720
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

3490
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:08,720
Fucking radiation.

3491
02:16:11,720 --> 02:16:13,720
A crew member of nature.

3492
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:14,720
Spank.

3493
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:16,720
Oh my God, the fire's so OP.

3494
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:19,720
Whoa, it's so OP.

3495
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:21,720
It's literally so OP.

3496
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:26,720
It's so OP.

3497
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:28,720
Why no deer girl?

3498
02:16:28,720 --> 02:16:29,720
I thought you had good tape?

3499
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,720
Good show for Gen 4.

3500
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:38,280
Wanklin. Speedrun strat. Just like the deer and headlights, but the headlights are just

3501
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:46,080
your lifeless BDIs. Alright, on the next car you go. Don't take damage, zoom, or no,

3502
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:49,920
don't take damage, so we're going full defense often. Oh wait, there was a person I could

3503
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:55,560
have spoke to. I see the enemy! You have overcome the challenges of the dream and now you face

3504
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:59,920
the face with the conductor and the final boss, or perhaps I'm just the beginning. Let's

3505
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:07,280
put on a good show. Show me what you're made of. Oh, get away from me, you bum! Get away

3506
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:19,360
from me. No, go on fire, go on fire right now. No. His teleportation literally cheats

3507
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:34,720
he diddles him from the burn. You're such a cheater. Fuck you, bitch. Ow, you're hurting

3508
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:44,640
me. Stop it, get on fire right now. No. Oh my god, I don't have the fricking, I don't

3509
02:17:44,640 --> 02:17:55,400
have the framerate to respond to this. Please catch on fire. I'm just avoiding these ones.

3510
02:17:55,400 --> 02:18:01,800
Okay, just three stars. Oh my god, I don't have enough reaction time for this, I genuinely

3511
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:07,400
don't. This is why I like Isaac, because as soon as they give me the fricking leaf one,

3512
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:14,200
I'm good to go. Oh, well, I blocked that, I was lucky. Stop! Right, two, and then the

3513
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:20,360
third one, and then attack. Fuck you. Okay, see, see the fire is like literally keeping

3514
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:27,600
me alive. Fuck you, bitch. Do you think we'll do it? We're both on one HP, can I do it?

3515
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:35,120
Without fucking it up. Oh my god, I got an achievement. Defeat the conductor. One HP

3516
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:39,640
and a dream. Good show, turnip boy. You still aren't cunning enough for charming, but you

3517
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:44,920
got Matthew also blood in you. I don't think I can continue, bro. I ain't feeling so good.

3518
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:49,480
Good show. Now it's time to pick your last trinket. What, you thought you were done?

3519
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:52,760
Yeah, going through the train once is not enough to prepare you for what comes. Whether

3520
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:58,360
it's fighting the likes of my brother or dodging the IRS, you'll be doing this forever. Always

3521
02:18:58,360 --> 02:19:04,960
bashing baddies, always moving, always facing me. Car to car it goes, for this is limit

3522
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:12,960
list. It only gets harder. Chance to heal on enemy death. Well, yeah, I'm gonna, what

3523
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:18,160
do you do? You know this train is really killing all but I just wish it had Wi-Fi so I could

3524
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:23,880
play Ocean of Stealing. Infinite train, now give me that infinite bandwidth. Real untrue.

3525
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:29,200
Oh, you're not off. Oh yeah, it appears to run a train and it's infinite, right? Okay,

3526
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:32,520
okay, okay, we get it. Wrap it up, wrap it up, we get it, we get it, we get it. Okay,

3527
02:19:32,560 --> 02:19:39,840
the train's infinite, thank you. I am dead, okay. Faint on limits line. I got an achievement

3528
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:47,600
for that. Continue? Okay, that was interesting. Woo, what are you? Allows you to participate

3529
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:53,000
in the daily challenge run. Cowboy hat and sandwich ring. Okay, that wasn't, we'll go

3530
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:00,360
with the mains. The children yearn for the mains. You can see a teaser reference. I'm

3531
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:09,440
sure it was this one. At the, my turn. Luckily, that wasn't what you had to do for the extra

3532
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:14,960
stuff. I don't understand, was this train an infinite? Sadly, yeah. Okay, we're gonna

3533
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:19,640
go into the mains because we've unlocked it now. Assume that's what the post game stuff

3534
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:35,280
is. I'm digging a hole. Woo! Hi. Meow. Hello, living rutter bagger. Meow. I can see all the

3535
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:39,840
artifacts you have missed in the past across the dimensional plane. Let's speak further

3536
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:48,080
if you wish to embark. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Seek some software from a bell tepher. Oh my

3537
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:59,000
God, so it helps me. What the fuck does that mean? A bell pepper? Have I even spoken to

3538
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:05,680
a bell pepper? Show us what you missed for the true ending. I don't even recall interacting

3539
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:12,440
with a bell pepper. The barber? He already cut my shit off. How can he fuck me up even

3540
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:17,920
more? You must be, it was me that fixed your hair. It seems like your hair was the biggest,

3541
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:24,920
ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, anymore. Are you a bell pepper? Thank you for delivering it. Since

3542
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:28,400
you helped me in my business, the only thing I can do is help you. Here's a copy of five

3543
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:36,400
books you can figure out how to do taxes. Ah, rip it up. Okay, okay, okay, okay. And then we go

3544
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:43,120
back to the cat. Bell pepper? Wait, what are you? What? How do you say bell pepper? Well,

3545
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:53,080
excuse me fucking. Um, can I have some bell pepper on my subway sandwich? Yeah, so how

3546
02:21:53,080 --> 02:22:01,360
do you say that? Yeah, you go bell pepper. Bell pepper. A bell pepper. Hello. I can see that

3547
02:22:01,440 --> 02:22:09,440
you missed. Speak to me if you want to embark. Seek some fan art from a cranberry. Who is a

3548
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:21,640
cranberry? Bell pepper? Bell pepper? Hardly even know it. Who is a cranberry? Does anyone

3549
02:22:21,640 --> 02:22:28,600
know where the cranberry is? Any cranberry lovers? You want to spray cranberry? Yeah,

3550
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:36,280
remember that me? Remember that ancient fucking me? I don't know where the cranberry is. I don't

3551
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:43,440
know. Here blueberry. I love cranberries. That's right. I'm being up. Where's this cranberry?

3552
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:52,320
Oh, the graveyarder. Isn't a cranberry guy? Wait, you're still in my house, you bum. I phoned

3553
02:22:52,320 --> 02:23:00,040
a valve. Open your mind. Open your eyes. I knave her. Oh, I'm just like getting props to

3554
02:23:00,040 --> 02:23:12,120
stick on my head. Gobble, gobble. The band. We're going to cram your berry, you bear. Oh,

3555
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:16,760
you got a little chicken on your head. A little chickadiddy. We've got cranberries over here. Are

3556
02:23:16,760 --> 02:23:25,480
you a cranberry or are you just an orange? I don't remember talking to a cranberry. She's in

3557
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:31,240
Veggieville. An old lady. You have to find her cat. You've got to find an old lady's puss puss.

3558
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:44,040
Blueberry. Hey, dude, scram. You don't know me. Yeah, well, you help when the pick up. Dang,

3559
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:47,400
you seem a bit young for this, but hey, I don't think there was just like this through the

3560
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:57,720
top of their jar and they can handle it from there. Oh, I do help them escape. Okay, let's

3561
02:23:57,720 --> 02:24:09,200
start blowing stuff up. She's in the south. The other wieflings are right. Okay, she's south.

3562
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:21,160
We've got free heart this whole time. Shocking behavior. I can't believe we're 100% in this game.

3563
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:28,680
We're such gamers. Time to bust the boys out. Me and the boys. Right, let's get the old ladies one

3564
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:42,520
wherever she is. Hello. Wait, what? Are she like south, south? You're a strawberry.

3565
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:50,120
Well, that was rude. Sorry. I don't remember where the pickle gang is either.

3566
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:52,600
So you're a watermelon.

3567
02:24:56,440 --> 02:25:06,120
I don't remember. Shadow, shadow was your money game. Wait, try talking to the red cat in the garden.

3568
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:19,080
The secret ending is when you're too high. We go on LSD. I'm just a little turn it.

3569
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:21,960
Mind in his business. Let's talk to the red key.

3570
02:25:25,640 --> 02:25:32,120
Oh, it's my little apple munchkin. I found this thing called mango in the forest and tried to

3571
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:40,440
replicate the art style. Hope you like it. What? Wait, I'm a girl. You're a girl, riefling.

3572
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:46,280
Waifu. You destroyed a waifu.

3573
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:56,440
Girl this whole time. Well, bend over. I'm clapping you. No, the devs were just high. Oh,

3574
02:25:56,440 --> 02:26:03,400
the devs were high. Oh, okay. Hello, Mr. Kitty. Yes, yes, yes, yes, please tell me.

3575
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:05,640
Seek a document about an app on a phone.

3576
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:12,120
I can't do anything with that. Literally called turn it, boy. Also law-abiding citizen in

3577
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:17,960
pain types is real untrue. You had a hairpin in the family photo. My god, I'm a girl.

3578
02:26:18,040 --> 02:26:28,200
My pintas. Are you okay? These carrots have accepted acorn as their own. I know carrot. Okay.

3579
02:26:29,880 --> 02:26:36,920
Oh, you're a cranberry. Right. Are you a cherry? I'm going to just leave it to you, do you think?

3580
02:26:38,280 --> 02:26:39,080
Something in here.

3581
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:53,240
The forsake in house doesn't have the pickles in it. Does it? Oh, no, it does. Okay.

3582
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:59,480
Right here. Thanks, we owe you one here. Try this out. Your father used to wear one

3583
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:04,600
back in the day. Every good mafia still needs to lose their part. Oh, you got fedora. My lady.

3584
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:08,360
Oh my god, look at handsome you look.

3585
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:20,920
A very flavored kiss should heal you right up. Oh my god, we got a kiss. Oh my god, she heals us

3586
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:26,280
for free. Right, are you getting out or what? Well, this is goodbye. You won't see us around these

3587
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:30,760
parts. I mean, trying to get pinched. Good luck with that tax evasion, I remember. I didn't like

3588
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:38,360
your father, but he would have been proud. I turned myself into a pickle sorority.

3589
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,720
Right, I don't know where this app thing, I think you guys are going to have to,

3590
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:45,400
you need to go to the Forgotten Forest for the next one. Okay, thank you. Let's just Cheesy Doodle,

3591
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:54,280
because I do have to edit Mercy's ASMR next. She should have a role play up tomorrow.

3592
02:27:55,240 --> 02:28:01,160
I'll do the same thing where two hours before her stream time, it goes up. I think that,

3593
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:06,680
I'm sorry, I accidentally just, but I'm doing bad at doing this.

3594
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:17,640
And then, if the site is giving me her lines, I'll have an ASMR up as well. It's in the second

3595
02:28:18,600 --> 02:28:24,280
area. You said ga ga gigi, and when turning into the lollipop, it should be

3596
02:28:26,200 --> 02:28:29,080
What are you on about? What are you smoking?

3597
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:34,600
Can't believe it, Riflin, you're smoking without me.

3598
02:28:36,920 --> 02:28:42,520
Kering, I actually have never done any recreational drugs, because it's not safe for me.

3599
02:28:42,520 --> 02:28:47,720
Okay, there's something in the forest. Oh my god, that's it. Thanks again, you're welcome.

3600
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:55,080
I completely forgot where the prompt from the cat was.

3601
02:28:59,640 --> 02:29:02,760
I completely, you smoke? Oh, I never might know.

3602
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:08,360
If it became legal, I'd try it for the first time on stream. Why not? Let's see what happens.

3603
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:12,600
What? Can I war again?

3604
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:22,440
Rifling, smoking, rifle. So go back and then go north instead.

3605
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:28,120
Like here? No?

3606
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:40,200
I did buy some, they're pretty good. You did grab a phone, it was by Holly.

3607
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:48,200
The fuck's Holly? You're smoking that turnip, boys. Give me the leaves on your head right now.

3608
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:54,120
The next one is on the upper part of the warm up on the north-east train.

3609
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:01,960
Am I going the wrong way? I'm not supposed to be wrong?

3610
02:30:06,360 --> 02:30:14,120
This next one is on the upper part of the lower, you're in the wrong forest. You know what?

3611
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:18,600
Check your inventory for the phone. I just made.

3612
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:26,200
Okay, I need to go to the bottom forest. This is the woods.

3613
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:36,200
She's in the rocky camp, the rocky map. Are you, not your...

3614
02:30:38,280 --> 02:30:43,800
Are you Holly? Nope, you're Ellie. Holly, are you Holly? Healy, close enough.

3615
02:30:45,160 --> 02:30:48,600
Holly, oh my, you got my phone. Since you obviously care a ton about that in your

3616
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:53,400
webs, can you sign the petition to thought from banning flip-flops? It's one of my favorite

3617
02:30:53,560 --> 02:31:01,080
so I have no idea. Get that out of here. You destroyed every single tax document. Now that

3618
02:31:01,080 --> 02:31:06,840
you've destroyed all the tax documents, maybe go try and fight the mayor again? Okay, okay.

3619
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:12,920
We honestly didn't miss like that much at all. Right, let's go wallop his arsehole.

3620
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:19,560
Please tell me this is all unblocked. I'm not doing it again. Okay, thank God, because I was,

3621
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:24,040
I'm not doing all that again. Wrap it up. Wrap it up. It's good to be above.

3622
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:28,440
It's time for the true ending.

3623
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:35,400
Oh my God, sorry. It's really messing me up that the action button is to swap.

3624
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:39,480
Oh, I thought I was going to make me do that again. I was like, do you fucking dare, mate? Do

3625
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:47,960
you fucking dare? Right, wallop him and then run away. Okay, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk. Okay,

3626
02:31:48,680 --> 02:31:53,480
now go big. Okay, boss fight again, but then we get the true ending.

3627
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:07,480
Went mad with power. Right, let them wallop. One, two, and then one, two, and we can actually

3628
02:32:07,480 --> 02:32:15,720
get three with a laser. One, two. Oh my God, can we do a hit list? Can we do a hit list? Come on,

3629
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:24,280
do a hit list. One, two. I can't unfortunately get my wallops in. One, two.

3630
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:34,040
One, two. No, me getting hit lists. Come on. I'm just so MLG like that. Come on, baby. One, two.

3631
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:43,240
I can't hit them because of the gunk. No, I'm doing hit lists, sorry. One, two.

3632
02:32:43,400 --> 02:32:51,480
Can I get away with a hit list? No, I jinxed it. Sorry, I jinxed it. Whoops.

3633
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:59,800
One, two, three, four, five. Okay, that's close enough. Right, let's see. Let us see what happens.

3634
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:07,320
Did you think you won? Did you think you'd beat this little game we had going on here?

3635
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:11,720
You think I didn't notice that you destroyed every single government document?

3636
02:33:12,600 --> 02:33:19,080
I have one last trick up my sleeve. Did you notice in my basement below? The fucking nuclear bomb?

3637
02:33:20,280 --> 02:33:27,800
Yes, it's the nuke. The same nuke your father wanted me to deactivate. Your father was a dead

3638
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:33,320
beat. He thought it was too dangerous to keep around so he wanted me to prevent it from ever

3639
02:33:33,320 --> 02:33:41,320
being used. But now that he's not in the picture, guess what? Get nuked, kiddo.

3640
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:49,320
Hello?

3641
02:33:49,720 --> 02:34:01,320
What the? What?

3642
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:13,320
Durned boy, Durned boy, are you with us? Wake up. Wake up, Durned boy. I think we've left the atmosphere.

3643
02:34:19,640 --> 02:34:26,120
Ridley, how the fuck am I supposed to win against that? Oh, last Durned Boy, I've ascended. I've become

3644
02:34:26,120 --> 02:34:32,440
in an unstoppable foe's greater than the mushroom giants in the past. I will bring taxation to the

3645
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:42,760
world. No, to the universe. There will be taxation without representation through the galaxies. Goodbye,

3646
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:56,200
Durned boy. It's time for you to die. Oh, Mars, what is that thing? Durned boy, go find the rest of

3647
02:34:56,200 --> 02:35:10,920
the IRS. I'm stuck in here and they're our best bits. Oh, Mars, Durned boy, what do we do? You

3648
02:35:11,480 --> 02:35:16,440
become that thing? I need to do something. Something really cash money. Click the

3649
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:23,400
balloon at me. I can try and dunk on him. Remember, don't be the turnip that believes in

3650
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:28,760
Chad. Be the turnip that believes in Durned boy. What? Sorry, that came out suddenly in 2007.

3651
02:35:30,440 --> 02:35:37,480
What the fuck? Ray Flinch, you never told me this was part of the game. Oh, shit, I did that wrong.

3652
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:42,120
It's not fucking handsome, Mika. I'm going to cream.

3653
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:03,640
Oh, my God, you're a burpee boy. Burpee boy.

3654
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:07,400
Yeah. Very burpee boy.

3655
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:19,240
Ice ogre, what the fuck? Sorry, I'm trying to try hard, but it's not happening.

3656
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,600
What are you doing here? Go find the IRS. Bruh, I'm true.

3657
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:31,160
I'm panicking. Sorry, I'm just trying to see what the math has given me.

3658
02:36:33,640 --> 02:36:41,320
You've never warned me about none of this. I can tell you that much. One user in trouble.

3659
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:45,000
I'll fuck off, honestly.

3660
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:51,480
I just need to get the three of them, right?

3661
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:58,680
Is that honestly how to make it? I'm going to cream a bit of this. It sounds like her a little bit.

3662
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:11,560
Oh, sorry. Oh, no, it's all fucking crumbling. What do you do? Hello? I saw what Chad did,

3663
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:17,080
very brief. I will do the same. Give me a bomb. What do you mean, give you a- What are you? You want

3664
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:31,720
me to kick the bomb at you? He fucking sacrifices himself.

3665
02:37:35,560 --> 02:37:43,800
What the fuck is going on in this game? Oh, my God.

3666
02:37:44,600 --> 02:37:53,960
No, what? I nuked myself? Okay, what's going on with you? Oh, my God, right? Oh, my God, I sacrifice

3667
02:37:53,960 --> 02:38:06,920
them all. Oh, he says, dude, what the heck? What was that?

3668
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:14,920
What?

3669
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:21,960
It ain't even appropriate. Oh, my God. What?

3670
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:27,560
Okay, we did it. The real ending.

3671
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:33,880
The high table has been defeated. Oh, fuck yeah. When you put it like that, hold on a minute.

3672
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:42,520
We won. People are allowed to exist without being fucking money funnels.

3673
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:44,280
Oh, okay. Hold on a minute. We did it.

3674
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:57,720
Oh, we did it. What the heck? That was such a bizarre, bizarre game. I 100%

3675
02:38:57,720 --> 02:39:04,040
am definitely playing their other game. 100%. There's no way I'm not. Hold on. Let me make myself

3676
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:07,800
big. Big straight.

3677
02:39:13,240 --> 02:39:21,480
Okay, big straight. Bizarre. Strony went all the way. No. English folks say that, I don't know.

3678
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:30,920
Oh, British people. It's Shabby up. That was a really good game. Sorry. That was like a 10 out of 10

3679
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:36,440
game. I'm recommending the girls to play that as well. That was fantastic. I will obviously change

3680
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:42,520
the rooms around. Tomorrow, I will do the question thing. If you guys have any funny things that you

3681
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:49,640
don't know about, you're more than welcome. Oh, God, Shabby's doing ASMR. That's perfect.

3682
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:54,280
You guys get me screaming like, what the fuck? We're going to get typed in so that you can die,

3683
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,920
and then you're just going to a peaceful Shabby.

3684
02:40:00,280 --> 02:40:04,120
Azura's live too. Oh, that's fantastic. Oh my God, there's so many options today.

3685
02:40:05,080 --> 02:40:09,720
I appreciate they made possible to get the secret ending even at the end. Yeah,

3686
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:16,600
we can chill with ASMR like that onion there. Yeah. That was a fantastic wee game.

3687
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:25,400
Um, so the plan of action is my little rufflings. Um, that I've got a brave question.

3688
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:29,960
When's the second play? You are pushing your boundary. You're pushing your luck, son. That's

3689
02:40:29,960 --> 02:40:36,520
what we see. If you're, um, if you're like a going too far, not in a joking way, you say,

3690
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:43,240
oh, you're pushing your luck. That's what we say. Um, that was fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed that.

3691
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:47,080
Please do not be surprised when we do turn it boy commits tax evasion.

3692
02:40:48,040 --> 02:40:55,000
No, we just played that one. Um, we do the prison one. I think we go, no, we rob a bank. We rob

3693
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:01,320
a bank. Don't be surprised when we rob a bank. It's like perfect stream length. It's fun. It's

3694
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:08,360
engaging all of, well, oh my God, elite gamer jokes in it. Um, so we're definitely going to be doing

3695
02:41:08,360 --> 02:41:13,400
that. Um, that was hell of fun. That was a 10 at 10. I'm going to recommend it to the girls. So

3696
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:19,400
if you see them playing it, watch their playthrough as well. Cause that was so fun. Um, yeah, sorry

3697
02:41:19,400 --> 02:41:24,360
for the kind of shorter streams this week. However, as I said, there's a lot of content being done in

3698
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:30,760
the background. Uh, we just launched the VTuber Clipping Program. Um, for us in particular, um,

3699
02:41:30,760 --> 02:41:35,160
obviously you can clip anyone while you're in it. Um, but you only get paid for clips of

3700
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:39,720
Vila or type thing. It was a lot of fun watching Wometh X Fresh Women. Ah, you're more than welcome.

3701
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:45,320
Um, it was a really good game. Thank you. Thank you. Well, glad you enjoyed it. Um, yes, I will

3702
02:41:45,320 --> 02:41:51,000
redirect into Love, Strongly, Getting the Girls to Play Puzzle Games again. It literally is never

3703
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:56,680
ending, but that wasn't hard. Like if I, I figured it out when entering the room for the first time,

3704
02:41:56,680 --> 02:42:03,240
I'm sure, then they're a lot smarter than me. All the girls are 100% no doubt, um, in heck,

3705
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:08,920
like way smarter than me. Fun game with a cute and lovely moment. Oh, you're gonna make me blush.

3706
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:15,000
Any amount of time we get, we use amazing. Oh, thank you. Uh, thank you for the stream moment.

3707
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:20,120
Strongly is the puzzle game master. No, thank you for the stream and all the love. I feel,

3708
02:42:20,120 --> 02:42:25,400
I feel very reassured yesterday when you guys were like, oh, it's okay if it's a shorter stream,

3709
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:31,000
like if that helps you out. So tomorrow I'm going to be answering the questions. Um,

3710
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:35,480
the meme-y ones, the funny ones, all that jazz. So if you have any funny questions about life or

3711
02:42:35,480 --> 02:42:40,520
whatever, you can just throw them in my marshmallow, have a little peek at them. Um, but yeah, tomorrow

3712
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:46,840
is a Zatsu stream, just a two hour experience. The game was almost as cute as, uh, you, jump,

3713
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:50,840
that you're going, hold on a minute, let me fucking actually put my toggles on for one.

3714
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:59,480
You're gonna make me blush. Oh my God, Reefland. Stop it. Imagine if I was actually a skilled

3715
02:42:59,480 --> 02:43:05,880
reachable like that. One day, one day, not today though. Um, the game is fun. I'm glad you get

3716
02:43:05,880 --> 02:43:10,600
to enjoy. Oh, it's so gay. We said to a good day off, but you don't want to end the streaming

3717
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:16,120
streak real and true. And as I said, when I stream, I don't feel stressed. I feel nice and relaxed.

3718
02:43:16,120 --> 02:43:21,800
I'm having a good time. Um, as soon as I hit end broadcast, all the despair comes back, especially

3719
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:33,480
the, like I said, I woke up with separation anxiety. I had to take my little heart medication

3720
02:43:33,480 --> 02:43:36,760
because my heart was like thump, thump, thump, thump, and I'm like, I'm streaming soon. It's

3721
02:43:36,760 --> 02:43:42,040
fine. It's fine. I don't want to lead the stream. Oh, but you're going to get tingled by Sheebie

3722
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:47,400
though. And little sheepsters. Although my redirects haven't been working very well,

3723
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:53,160
YouTube updated recently. And I think that's why my redirects have been messing up horrifically.

3724
02:43:53,160 --> 02:43:59,160
Because it literally says right now that, yep, 100%, I am redirecting into her and I don't

3725
02:43:59,160 --> 02:44:07,960
even get what's going on. Um, but yes, please thoroughly enjoy Sheebie Cottonbums tangles.

3726
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:11,720
Don't be afraid to like, subscribe her content. Or like and subscribe this stream. Shit.

3727
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:16,600
Just subscribe to Oliveela. That'd be great. So I can post the artwork because it's so cute.

3728
02:44:17,240 --> 02:44:19,000
There's such a cute artwork coming.

3729
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:24,840
Open an old video and shrink the windows. The chat is just rolling by. Thanks to this

3730
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:29,160
stream. No, thank you for this stream. That was so fun. Literally 10 out of 10 game. Thoroughly

3731
02:44:29,160 --> 02:44:35,000
enjoyed it. I will swap the titles and the thumbnails very shortly. Please thoroughly

3732
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:39,240
enjoy Sheebie. I will talk to you very soon. Would you ever do a Twitter space?

3733
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:43,960
Went off stream. I don't like Twitter spaces. Twitter is for opening up,

3734
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:48,600
using one handed and then closing again. That's why I never use the damn thing. Although if you

3735
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:52,600
do follow me on Twitter, you might have seen the fucking cringy memes I made of the girls,

3736
02:44:52,600 --> 02:44:59,640
okay? I said what I said. I said what I said. I made memes of the girls. I said memes of the girls.

3737
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:05,880
I made memes of them before I knew them and I posted them. So if you do want to go on my Twitter,

3738
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:10,120
it is linked in the description below, but I don't really use it that much outside of that

3739
02:45:10,200 --> 02:45:16,200
cringy fire. The Aminia Zero memes were on point. Yeah, so I didn't know the girls when I made them.

3740
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:22,920
We didn't know their personalities or anything. So thank you for the stream. Anytime spent always

3741
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:32,920
makes my day better. No, thank you. The big step one has to be the best one. Okay, I'm going to

3742
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:38,920
give you loads of kisses. Thank you for letting me play this game with you for the first time. I

3743
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:43,080
thoroughly enjoyed that. That's 10 out of 10 experience. That was lovely. Absolutely lovely.

3744
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:50,040
And I will see you tomorrow at the regular Schmaggler time, okay? Not to be confused with Schmaggler.

3745
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:55,480
Regular Schmaggler time. I'll see you. It'll be that soon. Experience tomorrow. So please

3746
02:45:55,480 --> 02:46:00,840
do it. If you're expecting me, be like surprise. No, I'm just I'm ranting in the void, ranting

3747
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:06,760
about any subject that I like and what's meant to me, okay? Stronny standard time. Exactly. Stronny

3748
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:12,600
standard time. No puking. Sheeby's got you. Azura's got you. Azura's up with a Apollo right now.

3749
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:19,960
No, thank you. And Keanu Reeves points. Okay, I'll give you loads of kisses. Thank you. I see you

3750
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:26,680
tomorrow and you never know. I might just have a new ASMR video up as well as Mercy. Thank you,

3751
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:36,760
Reefling. Love you. Say hi to Sheeby for me.
