1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Testing, testing. Attention, please. Attention, attention. Hear you, hear you.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:17,000
Skyrim belongs to the North. That's my hear you, hear you. Why are you saying I

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,840
hate you? I'm not even fricking spawning yet! Let me spawn in! You know, I learned

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,000
something new yesterday thanks to TikTok so I can't wait to talk about it.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,920
Right, testing. This is Ambroker. See this fricking, you fricking freaks? Oh my God! Oh my

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,200
God! I'm YouTube, I got accepted from YouTube monetization like right now. No

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,520
way! I just got accepted for YouTube monetization right fricking now. No way!

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,560
Wait, but I need to do my stream then. Wait! Oh my God! I literally just opened up

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:12,360
YouTube studio. I've been accepted. No way! Wait, do I need to go offline and do my...

10
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,920
No, I'll do it tomorrow. Oh my God! We did it! What the frick? What the frick frack

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,920
tiddly-tack-tick-tack-patty-work? Oh my God! Wait, and hopefully this doesn't say anything.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,120
Wow! Wow! I just fricking checked. Right, right. We're still going to do Skyrim

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,680
today because you know, Skyrim belongs to the Norths. But tomorrow I'll get to do my

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,360
monetization celebration stream! And my toe is like amazing for it so I'm excited.

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,680
Oh my God! That's amazing. Right, if you're fricking watching right now, don't

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,720
worry about how you call it. The memberships aren't activated because I

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,720
need to go in and tell it what to call the tiers and stuff. But I'm 100%

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,240
sure tier one is $1.99 USD. This is to prevent anyone gaining access via

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,320
gift to membership streams. And then I believe the membership price, like the

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:27,360
actual price, is $4.99 USD. Does that sound right? I need to ask you guys. I need to ask you guys what sounds right.

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,280
You guys call the shots. Yeah, if it's $4.99 USD and then Patreon's $5 USD then it's $9.99 total to

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,240
support your Oshii at Veiler. You're okay. That seems right. Okay, that sounds

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,480
okay. Everyone's going to give me the thumbs up.

24
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,480
Congrats on the monetization. Doesn't mean we won't support you in other ways anymore though.

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,480
Oh, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Why are you giving me money for getting more money?

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:08,840
What the fuck? It's an infinite money glitch. Oh my God. Also, there was an offline donation

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,840
by Shank. Shank says, thank you for the tip, by the way. He says, I'm over here squidding

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,920
my dick. I got ink on my dick right now. Which is so good. Thank you, Tim Shuttle. Congrats

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,120
on the monetization. Thank you. And Bajinga as well. Thank you again for the tip, for

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,720
the 20. That was a big tip. Thank you. Okay, to prevent gifts, you need to set the membership

32
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,640
quote above five bucks. Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wasn't it not membership

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,480
can only be gifted? Stop giving me! Why are you giving me money for being able to make

34
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Oh my God. No, I have to end my ASMR series now. I have four ASMR videos. I owe you. Oh,

35
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,480
and I'm doing an endurance stream today. It's over. Reluctantly saying thank you for the

36
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:11,020
tip. Wait, I could have sworn you can only gift the lowest tier membership on YouTube

37
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,320
or has that been updated since? I won't say who so they can announce it themselves, but

38
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,600
someone else has also gotten monetized. Oh my God, we're all done are monetized. No way.

39
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,960
Like, okay, so the only reason we didn't like monetize faster in quotation marks is because

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:36,520
you stop it. Don't give me money for getting money. Preordering my search. Thank you. Don't

41
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,320
stay down for the tip. That's crazy. That's freaking crazy. Gifts go to the most expensive

42
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,480
tier under five bucks. So I need to set it as 501. That looks terrible though. That looks

43
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:56,160
so greedy, but I can't have any outsiders in the membership streams because I need to

44
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,240
use a lot of euphemisms. Are you squid me right now? Shank. Oh, it's offline. I'm all

45
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,920
about stron of the bath. Thanks, Shank, for the tip. You guys will get the Blackwater

46
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:18,920
reference very shortly. Super training up. Virginia. Stop. Actually, one cent greed law.

47
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,240
Actually, it's two cent greed because I wanted it $4.99 as fat. Said it to sit. No, $6 is

48
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,320
too much. This is too much money to ask for, like, for membership stuff. Oh, right, that's

49
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,120
it. When I said we're making an agency together, we flinched. I wasn't kidding. Oh, I see.

50
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,040
And our snowberries are here. They just did an ASMR stream. We all have to keep our voices

51
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:51,200
down, okay? The snowberries are asleep. Fine, you've got it. Set it to 999. I would start

52
00:05:51,280 --> 00:06:02,280
at $60 just to be sure. Post up. Hi, icy raiders. Hi, snowberries. I just unlocked monetization.

53
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,920
I didn't know until I freaking went on my channel. It just happened right now. I'm not

54
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,000
going to do my monetization celebration today. I'm going to do it tomorrow and then it gives

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,680
me less time to do endurance skyrim unless we come back to maybe switch up the thingy.

56
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:24,480
But that's okay. It's actually a perfect transition from icy stream. Hi, hi, little icicle.

57
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:34,640
But yes, we are all getting monetized very slowly, which is fantastic. Oh my gosh, you can get

58
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,800
support via email or chat. Don't worry, that chat support thing does absolutely nothing.

59
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,800
I assure you, it doesn't do a single thing, okay? I actually, I tell a lie, they did help me one

60
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,920
time, so I'll give it up. Amy, thank you, Amy, for your clap, clap, clap. Apparently, there's

61
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,800
one other person that has been processed. When we applied, it was like, yeah, it takes a month

62
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,360
for them to review your chat. A month! A month to review James Cameron's avatar, excuse me.

63
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,440
A month to freaking review Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, excuse me. Oh no, no, oh you guys

64
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:22,800
so much ASMR video. But I do have some good news about VTuber Collabs. I finally, I finally

65
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,960
sent away. So now I'm waiting on the girls. The ball is now in the girls court that I'm collabing

66
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:44,720
with. Yeah, yesterday, I was listening to a music creator called Yoast. He's a Dutch and he was in

67
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Eurovision and he said, welcome to Europe. Life is till the end, Europe, Europe, Europe. Turns out he has

68
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:03,680
a song where it goes, suck my, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. So just imagine me playing the song and

69
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:14,080
repeat in the dark, taping up four ASMR collabs in one go. A month review time sounds realistic,

70
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,960
given the fact that your streams are all above 10 hours. Like I also thank you for the tip again,

71
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,720
but you're giving a lot of money. You need to be careful. Are you screaming me right now?

72
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,200
Thank you for the tip. Oh my God. Damn, I almost got that song out of my head. Yeah, so basically

73
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:46,000
just imagine me in a dark room. Just, I had this song on repeat. I'm like, yeah, okay. Right,

74
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,080
Wolf Mums, Pamper You to Sleep, right? Okay, what's next? Okay, Jealous VTubers drag you in an

75
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,240
alleyway for tangos. Okay, but what's next? What's next? Right, next script now. Like I was on it.

76
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:05,440
I was on it. Anonymous. It's the silent and on his back. He's giving money, but he's not saying

77
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,960
anything. He's not getting Brian to say anything. Thank you for the tip. But yeah, anyway, that's

78
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,160
how I work. I don't know how you work, but I work like a madman. Had to take a shower. So I've got

79
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,320
to listen at 1.5 speed for the next 15 minutes. I was not prepared for the super speed beat up.

80
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,400
So I was as strong as I forgot to live tweet or tweet. If you mean tweet, I have absolutely

81
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,120
horrific news. I am the worst VTuber to ever spawn. I never use my emotes. I spent like so much on

82
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,240
all these emotes. I never use them. I never tweet out when I'm live, because I start at the same

83
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,960
time every single day and I'm like, you want to be here, you're gonna be here. Somebody,

84
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,640
absolutely. Next script. YouTube to monetize you one day after you get approved. I mean,

85
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,840
depending on how the monetization celebration goes tomorrow, that's quite plausible. But hey,

86
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:06,320
at least a little bit YouTube history. Don't mind if I make the headlines for Veal Ur. So

87
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,040
you guys go and support my gen mates. That's right. There are five other lovely girls in the

88
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,920
description below for you to check out. If you cannot stand, Todd winning yet again with the

89
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,160
Death Grip, the Skyrim has over female VTubers. Okay. So if you've had enough of that,

90
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,080
Denny, you worry. I've got you sorted out. Sheepsters is going live in two minus two hours.

91
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,600
I believe Emma and Azura, my goodness Azura, and is coming for my Endurance Stream title.

92
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:45,360
For Goodness Gravy, she was up on a farm. No, it's not called Farmville. The farming star,

93
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,760
Jew Valley, for goodness sake. And then she beady popped out of 10 of her Endurance Stream. I'm

94
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,200
like, damn, they're coming from my title. I'm gonna show them how it's done. Okay, I'm gonna show

95
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,400
them how it's done. I woke up feeling sick and I was like, oh, maybe I would do an Endurance Stream.

96
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,840
But the moment I hit go live, it feels like I have been given a second burst of energy,

97
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,800
a second wind, if you will. It's like that cinematic moment in like the video game

98
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,280
thing. We're like, oh, Brian.

99
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,440
Congrats on monetization. Does the meet and greet VIP pass come with the highest membership tier

100
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:30,720
pre-order? Zarian. Dapper. Why would you give 100? That's so much. You never even said anything,

101
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:39,920
Dapper bucket. Oh my God. Thank you for the 100. Iron Reaper 100. Why are you? Why are you giving me

102
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:47,120
money for being able to earn more money? What's going on? What's going on? Have I missed something

103
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,000
in the VTuber etiquette book? Iron Reaper, thank you for the 100. Dapper, thank you for the 100.

104
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,640
Zarian, congrats on monetization. Meet and greet for anyone who goes over $20 on the donut.

105
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,200
That's terrible. You can't say that part out loud. Literally, everyone is giving your,

106
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,680
yeah, please make sure you are fully sorted before you give any money. Please understand,

107
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:22,240
I adore what I do. I have been welcomed with open arms into the VTuber community as someone who

108
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,760
could definitely have been described as an outsider. And instead of being shunned,

109
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,000
I was welcomed and taught the ropes, which I'm so thankful for. But please understand,

110
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,160
like, I can stream for free. I love what I do, okay? Anonymous with a 20 with no message again.

111
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,640
Brian, you look, you need to put Brian to work, guys, okay? You need to put Brian to work. Oh,

112
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:57,760
Anonymous gave me 20 because I said the 20 thing. That is terrible. But we've done it. We

113
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:06,000
officially have finished our first week at Bueller headquarters. Literally, everyone has done

114
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,800
fantastic streaming. I am very happy to see some of the girls taking a break.

115
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,840
Orvon Biscay. Brian. We don't like giving YouTube a cut.

116
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,880
Wait, oh, that's why you just stream elements. Okay, I understand. I read about that. Thank you,

117
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,200
Orvon Biscay. Brian! Don't knows will continue until morale improves. Congratulations. Wait,

118
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,240
why did I know that? Quote. Do you guys hear Brian at all when he talks? Yeah, you do. Surely you do.

119
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:44,800
Oh my god. Wait, you said I said your name yesterday correctly. Rilke? Rilke? Cadmus?

120
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,880
Thank you for the tip. Why did I know that quote? Yeah, we hear him. Okay, thank god.

121
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,920
God, it feels like so much longer. You've always been here. I think because, like,

122
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,640
my average streamed week is probably what a VTuber achieves in an entire month. So it feels like

123
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,680
I've been here for a very long time. I was like, nope, this is officially my first, like,

124
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,320
strong, you know, first second week of streaming. Ancient joke. The beatings will continue until

125
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:25,120
the more. Okay, that's okay. Okay, okay, okay. Guys, do you know a perfect way to party the

126
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,880
achievement? A really big storm of bad joke. What did you even say? Was that supposed to be a joke?

127
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,560
I don't get it. I don't get the joke if that was supposed to be a joke. So you're getting crickets.

128
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,600
Who's ready? Who's ready for bi-zura, bi-zura, bi-zura. Now, I know that's not in this game,

129
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,200
but bi-zura. Remember that time I accident... Wait, can you hear the game?

130
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
Can you hear any of that? You can't hear any of that.

131
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh, oh, oh, wait, get monetization off the screen right now.

132
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,560
Oh, my freaking mouse won't hover over... Right, there we go.

133
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,280
Oh, my voice is cracking already. I've never even started.

134
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Oh, oh, oh.

135
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,360
Don't begin. Don't begin. Don't begin of Skyrim. Don't know the words. One of them was like,

136
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
all glass for a meme fucking cover.

137
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Bite pulp, Bryan. This is our attempt at normalizing corporate green-free donations fanning.

138
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,680

eh grembo thank you for the congrats and the tip we are Nord build okay we are

182
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:56,300
Nord we are Stormcloak we are enjoying the game as the resistance or the

183
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:02,900
opposition to what the Legion is trying to put on the upon Skyrim as a whole

184
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,340
okay so Skyrim is the current region that we're in there's different regions

185
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,380
such as Hammerfell for example oh Brian you'd rather go to the woods with a

186
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:20,140
high elf or a grizzly bear um I don't know could that take on a high elf I

187
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,580
feel like I'm really weak apparently polar bears are actually the most

188
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,820
aggressive breed of bear if you didn't know that grizzly bears actually avoid

189
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,900
human intervention apparently right so we are Nordic a citizens of Skyrim they

190
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,260
are tall and fair-haired people strong and hardy Nord are famous for the

191
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,200
resistance to cold and their talent as warriors they can use a battle cry to

192
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:56,460
make opponents flee fantastic and are we gonna be a man or a woman oh um okay

193
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,460

210

211
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,420
it I'll need to listen to it more and right we're gonna be young and pretty

and so we'll use that face we're gonna be white as possible because you'll never

213
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,700
guess what color I am and the reason why you don't do skinny is because a skinny

214
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,620
is possible is because the clothes texture on the shoulders can you see

215
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,820
that you actually are better if you want less clothes a mashing to put the

216
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,980
weight up just a wee tiny wee bit and for the complexion again we're wanting

335
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:37,380
yes yes a key a key um take all I'm definitely gonna equip these because they're a lot better than

336
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:44,020
right I know I'm dressing up as the enemy okay but that's heavy armor uh we're gonna wait where the

337
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:51,540
frick is the key or he gets the key okay storm coke and drip in the same sentences oxymoronic

338
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,660
how do they're both bad but storm cooks are just worse the high king was leader of the good factions

339
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,660
the sky room and he surrendered to the empire because they were the less bad option I didn't

340
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,060
know that I thought it was like the thalmor embassy came in and they were like you can he

341
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:09,220
worship talus anymore and I was like eh you can't he come into my company and tell me what I can do

342
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:15,460
and can he do so eh I'll pick this guy storm cooks like you can't he just go and be doing that like

343
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:22,180
that's a region right where's the enemies oh oh yeah that's right look at that come oh my god it's

344
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:32,660
so bad on pc like when we analogue stick oh wow kill cam stealth goes from input I don't know

345
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,420
I'm normally like a two-handed player I always try to be an archer and I always end up two-handed

346
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:45,460
because there's a really good freaking um there's a really good um

347
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:59,380
enchantment which you can get from uh the yeah sorry torturer yeah yeah you're trying to tell me

348
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:12,420
that uh oh oh she getting it she annihilated him no I haven't seen him uh you can lock pick these for

349
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:19,380
like ah I guess we'll try it so there's eh you can literally smurf this if you leave and then

350
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:31,220
shuggle it hear that hear that if you do super gently see so we now know it's left side

351
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:40,500
oh I'm not getting pranked there you can literally smurf like all this stuff if you want it to be

352
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,300
made you can pick up this stuff but we are actually going to sell it because it's good

353
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,020
money I don't think I think there's a shield behind here if you wanted to do yeah if you want a shield

354
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:55,060
then uh there is one here but I don't really bother with shield that I do two-handed so we're

355
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:00,260
going to get a warhammer very shortly eh there should be coins down here and one of these if I'm

356
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:07,380
not mistaken I guess 300 no 300 coins seems a bit extreme maybe 30 coins in there and we are just

357
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:17,540
going to blast through it um try two-handing mage mage is my fave no two-handed warrior two-handed

358
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,620
lightweight warrior and you can muck around with a bow and an arrow like if you do the nightingale

359
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:29,540
quest you get light armor that's pretty sneaky but the thief-skilled armor especially for this

360
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:37,860
stamina and like item increase is so good um as for how we're going to tackle what we do first

361
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:45,460
um I'm going to purposefully do the companion's quest line and then load a previous save because

362
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,460
I don't like oh sorry sorry hold on I was out of stamina I was trying to reach up um that

363
00:41:51,860 --> 00:42:04,580
I see it just posted a very watery tweet no way the the piss corp uh accusations

364
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,860
we ain't beating them today and we ain't beating them tomorrow and the nightingales yeah pure mage

365
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:16,820
is hard mode I there should be something up here if I remember correctly on the right side of these

366
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:24,420
rocks what was it oh it's just a weak coin purse I got 14 gold honestly per scaley boy he's he's

367
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,380
gone you he couldn't get out but the bars are broken now I love the jewel wheels nightingale

368
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:42,100
peeler no not peeler that's awful but that's hilarious at the same time um right there are

369
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:51,700
spiders so if any of you are arachnophobic wow um don't worry they are getting absolutely yeah I've

370
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,620
been poisoned I think they give stamina of frostbite but yeah please look away if you're arachnophobic

371
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:06,420
we are just gonna blast through this area uh did I come from here uh um I think there's something

372
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:14,580
to look up there maybe I don't know I can't there is a bear ahead I say look away but you're too busy

373
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,380
doing something on your alternative twitter so it's okay

374
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:26,180
she doesn't have to know and we are going to take this for some really quick money I believe

375
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:33,620
there is an achievement for holding 100 000 gold at one stage the best way to make gold I have found

376
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:42,180
is by enchanting and selling that jewelry um there is a bit of a mild strat that I devised

377
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:49,060
myself I don't know if it's the strat uh survival mode survival adds the need absolutely not what

378
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:54,740
is this survival adds the need to eat sleep and stay warm it also adds challenges such as no no

379
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:01,220
and no I'm a vanilla skyrim oh my god is that is that pc option

380
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:11,700
um there he goes I just realized am I not am I not getting achievements on xbox for this

381
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:19,780
I don't think I am I'm not aww I named the stream zero to one thousand oops well that's a very accurate

382
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:27,060
run are you playing anniversary um it's an additional challenge oh well we should have

383
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:32,660
gotten an achievement there but we're not playing xbox some dumb imagine having to eat

384
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:39,380
eat 10 cheese wheels um so there is a really easy mine you can clear I think it will give us two

385
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,300
handed um that's just dead ahead it's like right in your oh wait actually sorry the standing stones

386
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:52,180
first uh standing stones I believe there are 12 standing stones which give you a certain boost

387
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,780
such as a faster leveling exp uh under certain things so there's a mage stone there's a thief

388
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:03,540
stone and there is a warrior stone but there's different ones as well one uh I believe is

389
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:09,380
like a mule stone where you just straight up can carry more items uh on your persons uh yeah literally

390
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:17,540
activate thief activate mage activate warrior uh we are gonna do thief um are we gonna do thief

391
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:24,180
what's warrior I've forgotten right we'll do warrior normally I do thief but we will we're

392
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,980
gonna clear out this mine very quickly we're just gonna pick up uh ingredients as we go along

393
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,580
the way of the stones the way war yeah this should be an achievement to find them all yes um

394
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:42,580
um well so they're just not have achievements at all because I'm not I'm playing on xbox game

395
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:51,300
pass but it's not like instance to uh xbox uh don't be too afraid of the wolves on the

396
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:59,460
they are too hip they can give you rock join oh I've gone past the mine already they can give you

397
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:10,660
is it no is it rock join or is it lockjaw I think it's rock join oh my memory of me

398
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:16,180
I've gone so past this mineshaft yeah here we go right there should be a baddie out here hello

399
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:24,980
yeah yeah yeah you're playing a novice no I'm not these accusations are unfound

400
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:33,700
it is rock join I thought that but strony where is the blarney and yes I know the blarney stone

401
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:39,620
what are you trying to make a balamori joke there's a tripwire here in this mine but don't

402
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:46,100
worry about it as I said you can please carry them up whatever level you want I like blasting through

403
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:53,380
and just absolutely annihilate and take this like it's so good there are some later stages

404
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,780
were even being on easy mode isn't that bad although I have to admit I guess this is registering as

405
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:07,780
PC Skyrim and it's quite different oh this is so sad they made this person mine themselves to death

406
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:13,620
they've had me working down here for days now it's not the time that's getting to me though it's

407
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:18,020
these tunnels I've told this countless times now to add extra support to the weak sections of the

408
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:22,740
tunnel if only we had more of these wooden beams that were we reinforced with bronze

409
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,380
honestly if I hear the earth shift one more time above my head I'm so stressed I may stop

410
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,300
drinking for good I mean what's a Nord without his mead and he died because of a collapsing

411
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:42,500
so my granddad was a miner and he used to tell me really rough stories about

412
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:51,780
um the he is like being in the mineshaft and all of that uh and they had a mine collapse and

413
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,500
within two minutes they had already killed the guy out and he was gone like he just perished it was

414
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:08,420
a main a minor yes um they did I think bandits normally have like a lock pick and coin but

415
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:16,260
that's not really the best um you can't just like straight up grab this shit but there is a big

416
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:22,660
chest in here so we're just gonna clear out the wait unless we oh I was gonna say unless we sneak

417
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:31,380
but the guys right there um yeah but like my granddad used to talk so openly about the um we just

418
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:39,540
got it to stick oh call is oh no hold on everyone knows I'm bad at log picking now um okay we've got

419
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:50,820
our first what are you 20 damage right 20 damage um he like spoke so openly about it and I'm like

420
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:58,100
granddad granddad that's just straight up like stuff that's like man-made like horrors beyond

421
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,780
comprehension type stuff uh this chest

422
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:11,860
okay we're definitely on pc because amber does not look like that what the heck

423
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:19,300
what the heck I've never seen that in Skyrim before am I going crazy or I don't know

424
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,500
I'm losing it right don't get ready to swing

425
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:36,660
that's so good oh um if the book is valued at 50 coins or more you will level up reading that book

426
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,940
if you are ever in a section and you're like what the heck are all these books if that book is valued

427
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:50,740
at 50 uh septum or more then it is actually a skill book oh oh my god that's so satisfying

428
00:49:51,460 --> 00:50:00,180
that's so freaking satisfying hold on a minute yeah that's a yeah bone archer

429
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:08,100
um I think there's a tiny little chest on the edge here I think there's a little bug with a

430
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:15,780
difficulty no not at all I'm playing on oh wait it's just in a vein if you didn't know um these

431
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,300
are called veins when you can see the ore sticking out from the wall it's quite interesting honestly

432
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:27,460
maybe I should talk about mining because my granddad spoke to me in big detail about it all um

433
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,180
and like how they used to come out and like their eyes really bloodshot red and everything

434
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,980
have I missed that chest back there I think I have but it's not a big deal

435
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:47,220
yeah I thought that and I just like I was like I've missed that chest haven't I but it's fine

436
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,780
if you run with your weapon out your stamina will decrease but that's okay you don't really need it

437
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,780
especially when you're just so good at the game like playing legendary mode like as I'm playing

438
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:02,660
right now if you didn't know I'm playing legendary mode like just because I'm such a pro everything

439
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:08,340
becomes really easy and you just have to like understand the strats as long as you like swing

440
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:17,380
first basically you win every fight and the reason why they hardly do any damage to me is because I

441
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:23,380
have such high defense of course and not any other reason if you're looking for work go see

442
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:32,100
um Rayloff said you could help me Rayloff of course you're he's a friend he promised you could

443
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:40,180
help we escaped from the amperials together she lied as easily as she breathes what are you talking

444
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:49,220
about this is legendary mode literally like I know it's hard to believe that a vtuber is just so

445
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:55,540
good at skyrim that they can play legendary mode as casually as I can but it's just it's just the way

446
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:06,980
it is okay so the area is now just discovering that dragons are coming back I don't know why

447
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:12,260
but I actually believe you you've got the look of someone who's just seen the dragon legendary easy

448
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:18,420

I'll still leave the the light armor on I know why are you doing two-handed with light armor

563
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,220

582
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:43,620
or yeah actually maybe um maybe we just do the main campaigns I wouldn't actually I would be quite

583
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:50,420
happy and satisfied with Skyrim again if the book is worth more than 50 gold if we do the main quest

584
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:57,620
lines instead then I would actually be happy with what we've achieved with Skyrim and we can

585
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:03,140
oh my god I forgot there's rats here hold on oh I'm getting bit to death oh my gosh oh my god the

596
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:28,900

597
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,900

600
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:55,540
you feel I'm not sharing it with anyone is he about to get rolled by a drogger

601
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,540

602
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,420

604
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:19,300
saw mudcrabs the other day horrible creatures wait yeah so it's on his person should we read his

605
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:26,500
journal left trigger read my fingers are trembling the golden claws finally in my hands and with it

606
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:32,100
the power of the ancient nordic heroes that fool lucian valerius has no idea that his favorite

607
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:38,580
store decoration was actually the key to bleak falls thorough now I just need to get to the

608
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,860
hall of stories and unlock the door the legends say there is a test that the nord's put in place

609
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:49,940
to keep the unworthy way but that when you have the golden claw the solution is in the palm of your

610
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:57,220
hand oh shit okay I saw that coming I'm so sorry I saw that coming I stood right on that trap

611
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:05,300
oh shit why when I use a stamina move stop holding the freaking stamina bar holy crap when I do a

612
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:10,180
stamina move it like makes me go to the side literally the only thing that's going to hurt me

613
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:16,500
in this game is um is uh traps nothing else

614
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,860
spider girl for jen too

615
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:31,460
so there's one I don't want to talk about it too much just for my baby girls like

616
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:38,340
bro we are only a weekend wait is there a drogger here I'm gonna crazy no and obviously I don't

617
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:46,340
want to disrespect the baby girls um I was talking to them about like how development works behind

618
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:52,900
the scenes um and unfortunately I used my words pretty poorly and it made some of them a bit

619
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:58,340
uncomfortable so I don't really like talking about it too much um but it's due to my poor

620
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:06,900
communication it's not due to the the girls in any way um but I what I can see is that

621
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:19,460
development takes a year at least for a generation like an entire generation if you will um and like

622
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:25,460
I don't want to say too much to make the girls feel like oh I'm just like casting them aside

623
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:30,900
because like oh shiny gen two like you know that's absolutely not the case like I have said this from

624
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:38,420
the start um if there is going to be a gen two it will be at least a year away like I am I am not

625
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:43,460
rushing gens out just for the sake of doing it that's that's so unbelievably disrespectful

626
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:50,580
to the girls who have placed faith in me um and like I still have a load of plans like now that

627
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:56,900
the girls are in the stage of being monetized um there's a lot of plans we can now execute um like

628
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:01,620
shorts as well there's a lot of shorts that need to be made um we have a fantastic uh

629
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:09,460
shorts editor who did a hail mary to the website and applied themselves um and he's he's been a

630
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:14,420
fantastic shorts editor he's pretty much done the majority of the work we have a a second one

631
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:18,980
who's quite busy at the moment but we are gonna you know test if it's all good and if it's all good

632
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:26,020
then you know we've got a lot of shorts play coming up um confirmed not a black company I I hope

633
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:31,540
not I I said to the girls wholeheartedly and hopefully they will voucher they remember I said

634
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:38,020
something along the lines I oh I wasn't paying attention sorry um I said if I ever do anything to

635
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:46,820
you that is like absolutely hurting you that hurts you in any way that is a completely negative

636
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:53,700
experience with me in any way take me out back and shoot me um like it was it's why I was very

637
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:58,580
serious in the interview uh they they are welcome to talk about the interview if they like um am I

638
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:06,260
gonna am I going back the way I came no I'm not um I said to them do not ever refer to me as your

639
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:12,340
boss do not ever think of me as like a superior or something like that um that's definitely not

640
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:18,020
ever how I want you to think like I am literally like in this with you we're we're memeing about

641
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:24,820
we're figuring out what we want to do like um definitely take me out back and shoot me I'm

642
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:34,020
so serious do not ever ever let me like oh that's it does more damage um like do not ever take me

643
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:39,140
like you know what's that saying you live long enough to become the villain don't ever let me live

644
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:42,900
become don't ever let me live long enough to become the villain take me out back and shoot me

645
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:48,020
like oh it's why from the get go like if the girls sign on their contract for another year

646
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:56,420
we the company um we offer an alternative outfit on the house for them as well as their pay increase

647
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:01,860
goes sorry I'm fucking trying to like remember the the attack pattern and where the droggers

648
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:07,300
spawn in this uh we'll talk about this but um like uh we definitely wanted to raise their

649
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:13,060
income and the split goes uh 85 15 again kind of showing that we're not really here for grade

650
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:19,380
we're kind of here for alternative reasons um so is there an actual say oh I don't own the company

651
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:29,780
like I genuinely wholeheartedly my my name I'm basically my role is what is a creative director

652
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:34,260
I already if you look on the thingy it'll tell you what the code is but you just need to move

653
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:40,820
these twice and then you've got the correct code uh unless it's different on pc uh but basically I'm

654
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:46,820
I was the creative director because I did used to have the scripts like I used to be the script

655
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:55,380
maker I no longer have that there's no a manager all I do right now is stream as strone as me um

656
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:02,420
and I send away shorts like I literally went into the girls DMs uh last night like after stream

657
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:07,300
and I was like hey um can I get an audio of you saying this and they're like yeah I'll do it in

658
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:14,180
the morning like that's that's all I do uh you're a cco I don't know what a cco is you're already

659
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:22,980
like the opposite of a black company I mean you're ready to be dragonborn word of power

660
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:34,100
learned force unrelenting force force um there's always an overlord or um some sort of um

661
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:41,780
protector of the words of power which you know makes sense all things considered

662
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,060
uh oh we're gonna break that down break it down now

663
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:56,500
uh chief creative officer um no I've uh we're just gonna break everything down and

664
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:03,220
I think there's a hidden chest by this waterfall although I could be completely wrong oh well no

665
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,260
damn my memory coming through it's been how many years since I played this game and I'm like

666
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,940
yeah there's a we hidden chest here then there's a there and then you can pick this up and then

667
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:22,180
do that oh my god so mlg pro honestly um wow you executed that based on honestly foos sounds like

668
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:28,820
the german word foo which means foot oh did you like my foos last night huh did did you like them

669
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:36,740
streams tell me I don't have I feel so feminine right now I'm like the most feminine I might get

670
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:42,660
more pedicures gonna say that that was so fun I enjoyed it the women was so like both the women

671
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:48,580
were so lovely I felt so flustered in that stream though I hope it didn't come across too badly but

672
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:56,820
I was like so out of my element like when I saw the time was an hour until uh sheepsters was up I

673
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:01,940
was like oh my god what have I done like how did I speedrun it it's like so quickly

674
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:12,420
have you got back the tool um it's still unfortunately very uh cut up so I've still

675
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:20,420
got a wee band-aid on it I washed it uh in the bath uh she got me good all I'm gonna say is she

676
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:25,700
got me good like it was deep you know like the side the smaller side part of your tool cut straight

677
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:32,580
into that she was really sorry though but it's fine like stuff happens honestly and I believe she

678
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:37,780
was new I believe she was new to the establishment so it's better to it's better for her to make a

679
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:41,940
mistake on me because like hopefully I'm nice and understand and they're like I didn't say anything

680
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:46,740
mean I was like oh you're fine like don't worry about it um and like the other women was like

681
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:50,580
translating for her because she didn't speak English and I was like it's fine so I'm kind of

682
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:55,220
glad she made that mistake on me rather than someone else who would have been like a Karen

683
01:19:55,220 --> 01:20:03,460
basically like I'm not gonna say anything about Australia but um I have I have heard some unique

684
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:09,220

705
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:29,460
I can't do that I can like hyper I say they call it hyper focused I don't think it's even hyper

706
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:36,500
focused it I'm not focused at all I'm just having a really good time um but yeah I'm very lucky that

707
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:42,900
I don't experience like burnout or anything I'm like yeah I can't really oh sorry oh I'm so sorry

708
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:49,700
to hear that you're having such a tough time oh yeah um right hold on I'm gonna unlock this

709
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:58,580
little windmill as a landmarker when you pepega farm that's terrible when you discover a landmark

710
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:06,020
you can fast travel to it which gets you around a lot faster um

711
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:14,020
did you know that with frostbills you can make dragons land I did not know that I always use that

712
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:22,340
shout um to get them to land oh it's so pretty look at the butterfly oh my god catch the butterfly

713
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:31,860
rip its wings off for alchemy yes oh purple butterfly he didn't serve it okay now we need

714
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:37,380
to wait for the game to hurry up with the npc so we're just gonna wait an hour oh there we go boom

715
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:46,180
just like that no burnout lucky you I just don't experience it I like I've never experienced

716
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:53,540
issues with that I don't feel it like I can feel tired like I can be like oh I need to go get some

717
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:58,740
like tea and some food and then we'll play like for a couple of more hours I can do that no problem

718
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:06,020
like at all I think the only time I feel I just feel frustrated that I don't have more time like

719
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:12,100
when I was doing all the ASMR collabs like writing all the scripts back to back and actually I knew

720
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:16,580
girl uh I'm used to tell a new girl and I was like hey you want to do some more and she was like

721
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:21,060
fuck you want to do some more and she's like I know a lot about you and I was like oh that's

722
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:26,020
embarrassing um but if you know a lot about me then you know how easy this collab is gonna be

723
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:32,180
because I'll do all the work um but like I don't mind doing all the work if anyone's lurking

724
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:38,260
I don't mind doing the work I actually prefer it um because it makes things a lot easier

725
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:44,420
and make every arrow count I used to not experience burnout playing games but now I do which is a

726
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:51,380
shame no so if you can't play video games that's like life burnout like if you would rather watch

727
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:57,780
someone else play video games then like play it yourself livestreaming doesn't count because you're

728
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:03,860
you're being tortured to watch me play Skyrim via uh my controller where the heck is this dragon

729
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:13,540
is he on the floor oh it is okay oh let's spank his butt uh whoa it's actually kind of hurt me a

730
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:23,700
little bit no you're stinking you're so stinking um see I've been on top here stamina bar is

731
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:34,100
greed out only HP oh it's landed again oh you're hurting me stop it you're hurting me

732
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:40,180
oh look at that two-handed 32 I should probably level that up we are gonna pick up the dragon

733
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:47,060
bones these are like why on earth oh he must eat a weight ring guard um dovahki no

734
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:53,220
uh so now this is where the NPCs get really weird around you I don't know what he's fighting

735
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:59,140
right now he's locked on something a mud crab maybe nearby there's mud crabs over that way

736
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:08,260
today I learned from a Scottish cuttlefish I may have burned out yes so if you'd rather um if you

737
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:11,220
would rather um

738
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:23,460
he's supposed to come up to me is it you

739
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:36,420
normally an NPC walks up to you and goes oh my god you are the dragon born in a really

740
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,340
poor like Swedish accent

741
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:46,740
what type of two-handed we specialize in in hammer, axe, sword those there's

742
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:54,340
aren't those one-handed yeah I'm just gonna pick up with the apocrity apocrity something like that

743
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:59,700
did he die I guess they may have perished yeah I've been uninspired by the games to play recent

744
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:05,220
so I'd prefer watching others like yes I think that is a symptom of burnout because of

745
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:09,060
the

746
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:16,100
I think the gray beards have summoned us

747
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:24,100
oh it's Khajiit who's a good boy hey push push push

748
01:27:24,820 --> 01:27:31,460
do you seek to make a purchase uh uh what have you got for sale I'm gonna just sell some of my stuff

749
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:35,940

750
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:44,500
I'm gonna break all this stuff down it's just so we're not too heavy and I can break those down

751
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:52,980
take red did that red did that we're gonna break it down I've got a brook bass and a Nord meat

752
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:59,940
resurrect and restore my energy would I do amber I'll just sell it I don't I don't really know

753
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:06,740
oh I definitely want to sell this I like how my speech gets better just selling stuff in general

754
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:13,620
like you always want to hold on to soul gems they're very important may the road lead to oh

755
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:18,020
that's why I always say safe travels land strider because of this game I think is really cute just

756
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:27,860
safe travels land strider khajiit roleplay stream uh I actually don't know how to pur you know how

759
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:49,060

760
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:55,780
khajiit has squares if you have coins I told you y'all not alone we're not causing trouble

761
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:02,180
so they're looking for uh someone but we're not doing that quest right now because we're

762
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:10,820
trying to zoom past this so we can go and do the main quest of the dragonborn I'm wearing a hat with

763
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:20,740
badass horns I'm the dover king known globally you're nobody at home he was so English in those

764
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:26,660
songs for no reason I'm just kidding it is his accent he's allowed to have an accent

765
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:34,900
if it's gosh I'm dover king known globally you're nobody at all like it yeah I think the English

766
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:43,620
rapping accent is a bit better than the scots was the dragon there uh the watch tower was

767
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:48,900
destroyed but we killed the dragon let's just skip a few dialogue and see it turns out I might be

768
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:58,340
dragonborn dragonborn what do you know about the dragonborn when the dragon died I absorbed some

769
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:05,620
kind of power so it's true the gray beards really were summoning you the vampire DLC I don't even

770
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:11,540
think I saw that one the gray beards okay okay okay we get blah blah blah blah wait

774
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:36,980
mis-input mis-input please don't fight me I didn't mean to do that I was uh the wrong

775
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:43,620
wrong button there uh axe of white run target dies within three second fills a soul gem

776
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:48,660
that's perfect because it's exactly the enchantment we want we're gonna break break it down now

777
01:30:50,660 --> 01:30:57,860
just breaking down everything um and we're gonna see if we can enchant our Nordic battle axe

778
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:01,700
although I even have soul gem I have the world's weakest soul gem

779
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:06,740
I'm gonna have to refill it so much if I end up using it

780
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:14,820
uh this is the best I can do

781
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:23,060
uh we're just gonna oh we're completely out of soul gems anyway

782
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:33,060
I'm sorry it was a mis-input it was a mis-input I'm so sorry look I'm the I'm the thing anyway

783
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:38,500
I'm the I'm a thing oh Lydia do you want to come with us so you can be filled with dragon bones

01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:56,740

787
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:07,140

01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:21,620
subconsciously made her this that shirt is making people nervous on it I'm still winning

790
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:28,980
Lydia cuttles for real for real right we now need to go all the way up this mount well we need to

791
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:33,060
go to Rorik's stead I versus it oh my god I'm such a fake gamer honestly I don't even know why you

792
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:42,020
guys listen to me half the time uh 20's copied my whole flow word for word bar for bar it's a

793
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:47,860
highland coup excuse me little gate let me just close that let me just close that oh it's the wee

794
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:56,820
highland coup look at this no uh whoa whoa whoa look at yidwi horns fun uh I mentioned this other

795
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:03,700
day actually uh I had a relative that owned one and uh the they they're actually super gentle

796
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:11,060
uh but it made my relative blind in one eye lamal uh because the horn poked his eyeball um that was

797
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:18,420
funny uh but he wasn't even mad at her it was a female highland coup I can't even remember what

798
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:22,340
he named there but honestly it sounds like the most Scottish you know I don't care about your

799
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:30,500
question the fuck up um literally I honestly must sound so Scottish a stream like oh my grandad

800
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:35,700
used to work in the mines uh had a family that family member that literally owned a highland coup

801
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:39,540
like oh my god that's where like no wonder I was raised in a bar and literally don't have manners

802
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:47,460
like I just I never had it from the start a wee coup a wee highland coup my favorite part of a

803
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:55,300
strong stream is our unofficial catchphrase did you know oh did you know did you know uh right I

804
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:00,180
think we're gonna manually walk there there are gonna be wolves ahead but because we're playing

805
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:07,220
legendary differently and I'm such an MLG pro at this game um it's honestly not problem and

806
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:12,260
we might even see Cicero on the way it's unlikely we'll meet Cicero on the way there just because

807
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:19,540
he spawns I find the Cicero spawns more northern west of the map and we are her and like going

808
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:29,780
southern east which is the opposite um Lydia no hello this was as stupid as a feud with clan

809
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:38,500
need something no oh oh she's got a bit of them oh what was that shadow freaking the honeybearing

810
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:44,340
meadery ah yes a bit of a bit of meadery oh wait will we open a veal or a meadery why not

811
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:51,620
that seems to be the way of like um content creators when they get in their end game they

812
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:59,780
like come out with a product I'm like I think my end game would be video games like uh like paying

813
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:06,340
to get them made like what what my my rubbish ideas are um I think that's probably my end game whoa

814
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:14,260
okay that was that was a lot going on the screen for one for one soul that was quite a lot there is

815
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:20,980
a waste on up ahead I don't think it's a good one Haggis and nips and ties

816
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,740
do you also live in a lone terror up on some hill are you

817
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:32,740
wait oh no is this an enemy dog no it's a nice dog hello I've been hunting and fishing in these parts

818
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:40,020
for years I've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years are you telling me my lore story

819
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:45,780
is shrek right now you can buy dragon scale you've not got the money for it all right

820
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:54,740
veal or drinks it may or may not contain something unique to the girls I see that

821
01:35:54,740 --> 01:36:01,780
skiver on the road don't think I can't see you oh so captured that that is the noise I like to

822
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:08,980
hear honestly I believe there's a few skeletons up on this hill but again nothing we can't handle

823
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:15,700
nothing you can't handle at all um as I said we're gonna do the main quest we're gonna do

824
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:25,060
the thieves um and then hello are you you are definitely an enemy oh I do beg your pardon but

825
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:32,340
it's all the way absolutely nothing around these parts and another soul capture do you have soul

826
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:42,740
gem spark white cat um we'll destroy those oh oh oh how dare you do you oh wait I think that

827
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:50,420
ancient that ancient bow is stronger than what we have for our bow um right we're skeleton scare

828
01:36:50,420 --> 01:37:00,420
ooh scary are you squid me right by the pope I don't like my family history every time I read my

829
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:07,780
family history I always have to ask myself are we the bad guys thank you for the tip

830
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:18,740
I think my family history is like really boring it's just like yeah Scottish and Irish

831
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:27,460
I know that you can do like 23 and me tests to like really see where you come from but I actually

832
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:34,660
don't uh I don't believe it's safe at all to like willingly hand over your DNA like that look

833
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:38,900
I know I'm starting to send like needy streamer overload where we're doing like that god speed

834
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:44,100
run where she you know she got into like all the conspiracy theories and stuff but it's not really

835
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:50,260
a conspiracy theory right I like maybe I should do a stream like that unironically I'll like yeah

836
01:37:50,260 --> 01:37:55,140
um wait what are you attacking you're not attacking me no you're not okay that's strange

837
01:37:55,220 --> 01:38:02,740
uh the scaly sounded like an oblivion scaly at least you got a cool accent out of the deal yeah

838
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:08,420
and we are just running our way over to mvark said I believe is the town name of where

839
01:38:08,420 --> 01:38:15,220
you kind of forgot the pronunciation um nah I don't think it's safe either type your DNA

840
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:25,220
on fail the company yeah like um I took like ethics class um and we were discussing like

841
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:30,820
how good like emerging technology is like if you haven't heard about crisper is DNA fixing

842
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:36,660
technology essentially DNA fixing um it's going through a lot of lab studies and trials and all

843
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:43,460
that but it's found very effective against like um you know things that were previously incurable

844
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:51,940
essentially or diseases that are uh untreatable that kind of thing um and the technology that

845
01:38:51,940 --> 01:39:01,620
can be raised from it um to help people is outstanding however do we do we trust such

846
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:09,460
do we trust your DNA sequence to be handled with care or would in theory insurance help

847
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:16,180
I'm sorry I'm literally hell yeah I'm up for scotland conspiracy theory stream thank you so much

848
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:22,500
totally not Virginia um like I could definitely get into it but we were like talking about like

849
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:28,420
uh didn't see one of the industry companies get caught selling all the data they said they

850
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:36,340
wouldn't is that yes uh not to mention um there's like a whole rabbit hole about what data leaks are

851
01:39:36,820 --> 01:39:45,540
um because um I don't know I don't know if you guys care but um there's actually a whole other

852
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:52,900
conspiracy um that data leaks aren't actually like that it's kind of more like government demands

853
01:39:53,860 --> 01:39:57,700
to have access but they already kind of have access so a lot of things especially with the

854
01:39:57,700 --> 01:40:02,100
technology in the state age but uh maybe I shouldn't go too far down the rabbit hole don't want to

855
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:06,820
deter anyone where the heck am I supposed to go I think there's a path ahead I'll just follow this

856
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:13,940
path um I thought we were going down the designer baby route oh well that already happened one of

857
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:20,420
the biggest examples of the designer baby route was victoria beckham's children you're telling me

858
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:27,460
that brown eyed lady has a 25 percent of uh blue eyed offspring and she just happened to pop out

859
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:36,260
to blue eyed children uh no she did what is called ivf and then the dna tested and checked if the

860
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:44,260
children and in the egg in the egg yes in the egg uh were able to uh had the recessive blue eyes

861
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:48,820
it has already been done in this day and age and that was back in 2005 or something crazy it's one

862
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:53,620
of the biggest public uh things that are right in the faces of people that you wouldn't know about

863
01:40:53,620 --> 01:41:00,260
it's already occurring today this also occurs with the fox p12 gene I believe I'm so sorry if no one

864
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:04,900
cares about this but I'll try and get through it really quickly there's also a gene that's been identified

865
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:10,020
called the fox p12 I believe um and if you have it it means you're actually a lot smarter and able

866
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:15,700
to pick up things a lot easier than someone who is without this gene and it's been called into question

867
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:20,340
that IVF babies may also be getting tested for this so you have a child or offspring that may be a

868
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:26,660
bit smarter than the average girl but that's just on me okay uh I'll just leave it I'll leave it there

869
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:33,780
but there there's a lot there's a lot okay um it's really interesting to continue the

870
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:38,820
happen yes so a lot of people think it hasn't already occurred or the first human hasn't been

871
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:44,740
cloned and dolly the first sheep was cloned in 1964 I believe uh the no no no no no that's when

872
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:51,380
we first were publicly allowed to be learned and to be taught about the cloning um it's already

873
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:58,500
happened long ago you just don't get to know about it because ethnically it's messed ethnically

874
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:04,820
ethically it's messed up and the public shouldn't really be allowed to access this knowledge because

875
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:10,340
well it brings up a lot of questions such as if you clone a person do they have one soul do they

876
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:14,740
share soul and then it brings religion into question if you didn't know religion also helps bring in

877
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:19,460
a lot of order into people's and communities lives and the rabbit hole goes incredibly deep but we

878
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:23,140
can't touch on that subject too much because I'm just a vtuber playing skyrim right now and we're

879
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:27,460
just trying to get to everything so we can talk to the greybeards to learn about our true powers

880
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:37,380
the dragonborn as we play this game so yes please don't mind me uh oh there's a saber cat after me

881
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:45,620
my goodness um but yes uh please uh please let us enjoy skyrim for what it is but anyway that's

882
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:52,340
why I don't really start talking about these subjects uh because uh yeah it's uh it's a bit

883
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:58,820
scary it's a bit scary when you look into it yeah right uh yeah gamers for genetically engineered

884
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:04,180
cat girls represent absolutely I'm 100% there with you the fact that nickel girls aren't real

885
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:07,940
I used to right this sounds really bad I used to actually fantasize about owning a nickel girl

886
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:14,340
I don't know why I just I used to fantasize about like treating her really well and like

887
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:18,340
she would have had a previous owner before me or something but I'll be like I'll treat you right

888
01:43:18,340 --> 01:43:24,820
baby I don't know why I give me like some sort of like superior like saving complex or something

889
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:30,340
I don't know why but like I just oh I used to fantasize about all of that like especially

890
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:41,940
after watching monster monster um I used to like really uh there should be a quest

891
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:49,380
where you deliver something for someone is it you here for work get an axe and bring me all the

892
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:56,980
wood you can chop oh okay right sorry jeez um if this dream doesn't demonstrate that the

893
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:01,860
Tism is strong and veiler literally tiffin box there's someone that gives you a quest

894
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:14,980
oh the graybeards 10 not well it's trouble is my legs aren't okay we're gonna yet if you talk to

895
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:24,740
this guy you can do a quest for him um there's also a hidden thing if you read all of these on the

896
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:28,420
way up something happens but I've completely forgotten what happens because I've never done it

1156
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:33,140
trying to steal a piece of the action who are the black briars have ripped it in their pocket

1157

my persuasion check failed eat eat i'm really getting tired of your excuses yeah like everyone

1161
02:17:04,660 --> 02:17:10,180
uh it's like okay this is the start of honest day's working in life for all that but everyone

1162
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:14,340
wants to talk to you at once when you enter rift and i have to admit it's a bit of a sensory

1163
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:19,540
bit of a cheeky sensory overload entering in your city and skyrim everyone wants to talk to you

1164
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:29,220
right uh how could you possibly know that i'm a thief right i'm gonna tell you something you

1165
02:17:29,220 --> 02:17:36,020

1166
02:17:36,020 --> 02:17:44,100
this person and it locks him up in jail and removes um a seller from rifting don't do it

02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:58,820
can't get from selling stuff these symbols you see around the city um these are thieves guild

1169
02:17:58,820 --> 02:18:04,260
symbols you'll see them everywhere it means this place has been marked or there's something of value

1170
02:18:04,260 --> 02:18:09,220
inside like you'll see the symbols everywhere and you always want to fail this quest it doesn't matter

1171
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:12,820
if you feel that you still get to become a part of the thieves guild um

Did you really make myself clear?

1329
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:32,040
Backwards

1330
02:36:33,560 --> 02:36:35,340
expertise

1331
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:40,000
and your not talking about golden glow

1332
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:43,160
this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work

1333
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:51,160
So let her prove it. Let her prove it. Let her prove it.

1334
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:57,160
However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands and shut us out.

1335
02:36:57,160 --> 02:37:00,160
He needs to be taught a lesson.

1336
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:03,160
A lesson?

1337
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:08,160
Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?

1338
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:11,160
My outfit!

1339
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:14,160
Oh, I get my outfit. Okay, look at the drip.

1340
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:19,160
Zero minus aura, zero risk, no gift.

1341
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:22,160
I'm expecting you to make us a lot of coin.

1342
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:25,160
Wait, don't I get my outfit yet?

1343
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:28,160
Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade.

1344
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:30,160
Outfit? Outfit check?

1345
02:37:30,160 --> 02:37:32,160
Outfit check? Outfit check?

1346
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:40,160
Minus 100 drip, honestly.

1347
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:45,160
Tonelia, Tonelia, Tonelia.

1348
02:37:45,160 --> 02:37:47,160
Alright, tell me about the job.

1349
02:37:53,160 --> 02:37:54,160
Makes sense.

1350
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:56,160
Right, we're just beginning our first Thieves Guild assignment.

1351
02:37:56,160 --> 02:37:59,160
Basically, we're destroying beehives.

1352
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:03,160
We literally said, yeah, we see the problems with environment, not our problem.

1353
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:05,160
We are going to go talk to...

1354
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:11,160
I've already forgotten her name, but she's in here and she's going to give us...

1355
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:15,160
Has my OBS just died?

1356
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:20,160
Am I still streaming?

1357
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:23,160
Has my connection just died? Please don't.

1358
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:26,160
Please don't do this right now, to me, connection.

1359
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:27,160
Hold on.

1360
02:38:27,160 --> 02:38:28,160
I think my...

1361
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:29,160
Oh, dear.

1362
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:30,160
Oh, dear.

1363
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:31,160
Oh, dear.

1364
02:38:31,160 --> 02:38:34,160
It's not looking bloody good for us, is it?

1365
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:42,160
I just got an error message saying I'm not on VTIP Studio for some reason.

1366
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:44,160
But you guys were saying you see me.

1367
02:38:48,160 --> 02:38:49,160
Oh, dear.

1368
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:54,160
Oh, dear.

1369
02:38:54,160 --> 02:38:55,160
Right.

1370
02:38:55,160 --> 02:38:58,160
I'm still here.

1371
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:01,160
I'm still here for some reason.

1372
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:03,160
It thinks I'm offline.

1373
02:39:03,160 --> 02:39:06,160
That's mildly concerning.

1374
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:07,160
Right.

1375
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:08,160
It's mildly concerning.

1376
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:09,160
But it's fine.

1377
02:39:09,160 --> 02:39:10,160
It's fine.

1378
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:11,160
Right.

1379
02:39:11,160 --> 02:39:12,160
We're Tonya.

1380
02:39:12,160 --> 02:39:13,160
Up in the donya.

1381
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:14,160
We're Tonya.

1382
02:39:14,160 --> 02:39:15,160
Up in the donya.

1383
02:39:15,160 --> 02:39:16,160
Tonya.

1384
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:17,160
Tonya.

1385
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:18,160
Tonya.

1386
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:19,160
Tonya.

1387
02:39:19,160 --> 02:39:20,160
Tonya.

1388
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:21,160
Tonya.

1389
02:39:21,160 --> 02:39:22,160
Tonya.

1390
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:23,160
Tonya.

1391
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:25,160
I remember her saying that.

1392
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:35,160
Two lovers.

1393
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:37,160
Forbidden from one another.

1394
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:41,160
One who stormfuls the other legions.

1395
02:39:42,160 --> 02:39:44,160
Bye.

1396
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:48,160
Yes.

1397
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:49,160
Right.

1398
02:39:49,160 --> 02:39:50,160
Zero negative versus negative drip.

1399
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:51,160
You know how it is.

1400
02:39:51,160 --> 02:39:52,160
Right.

1401
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:53,160
Right.

1402
02:39:53,160 --> 02:39:55,160
And do this one, they're items.

1403
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:57,160
And then April.

1404
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:06,160
Look.

02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:09,160
Oh, we, too.

1406
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:10,160
Oh, wait.

1407
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:12,160
Where did my weapon tree go?

1408
02:40:12,160 --> 02:40:13,160
Hold on.

1409
02:40:13,160 --> 02:40:14,160
Pop that back.

1410
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,160
Back.

1411
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:16,160
Back.

1412
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:17,160
Home again.

1413
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:18,160
Oh, actually.

1414
02:40:18,160 --> 02:40:20,160

02:51:14,440 --> 02:51:22,040
look for malice mark yes um which is quite a unique one because of what goes on inside the quest

quick question is our way to get into the these girl treasury not that i know of

1497
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:37,640

1507
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:55,480
it's pretty pretty yeah it's pretty deep plot i have to admit the plot is so deep like it's

1508
02:52:55,480 --> 02:53:05,880
probably i'd say an average of five inches deep of this plot um shut up just shut up um i will make

1509
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:09,720
a tea and get some food in me because i think i'm starting to go slightly delirious because i've not

1510
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:15,320
had anything i'm supposed to be holding a tasting of the new hunting so if he sees the meadery in this

1511
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:24,520
state there's currently skeevers and at his meadery and we're gonna offer some well that's not how i

1513
02:53:34,680 --> 02:53:41,800

1517
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:13,160
when i stream i just get so distracted because it's like such a good time i've always been like

1518
02:54:13,160 --> 02:54:28,280
oh my gosh oh all right i'm on the red oh you can't even see my health bar

1520
02:54:34,520 --> 02:54:41,080
right now that's how bad it oh maybe i need to adjust my chat so it doesn't go over the screen

1521
02:54:43,160 --> 02:54:47,720
especially for video games like this i might get that change

1522
02:54:50,360 --> 02:54:56,440
uh spaking the honeybrew mead with emmy needs honestly emmy needs delightfully

1523
02:54:56,440 --> 02:55:03,080

okay hold on lidia you lidia

1525
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:18,040
lidia you literally went around the room what do you mean by over the screen so you see how like

1526
02:55:18,040 --> 02:55:24,600
next to me is that little cuttlefish to my to your left i guess from your pop see how the chat is

1527
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:30,120
like going up on screen from that chat box i might change it so it doesn't so the video game isn't

1528
02:55:30,280 --> 02:55:35,400
um like encroached in any way because i just noticed now that you can't see my health bar

1529
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:43,160
um you can see my stamina constantly but my big hairs oh oh sorry there's traps sorry sorry

1530
02:55:43,160 --> 02:55:49,560
oh sorry sorry oh oh lidia lidia there's traps like did you not just hear me jump over them lidia

1531
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:58,840
oh right this fight always scares me because this guy is actually super OP for no reason

1532
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:04,760
there's a man in here oh we need to we need to get him first because i have like no magic

1533
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:11,960
oh bruv bruv hold on all right i'll get the rats first he is like so strong for no reason

1534
02:56:13,080 --> 02:56:18,360
and he freaking does that where he fucking backs off i hate when you back off when you're

1535
02:56:18,360 --> 02:56:21,800
fighting them like i know that's normal to back off when someone's like coming at you

1536
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:27,400
but it's so annoying just stand still and let me parachute it's like not that big a deal

1537
02:56:27,400 --> 02:56:35,160
yeah so that man was currently living with the the skevers um you know as long as he's happy

1538
02:56:35,160 --> 02:56:43,800
and thriving that's the main thing but uh no a little to the right no no a little to the left

1539
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:48,280
a bit more no a little bit more to the left

1540
02:56:49,240 --> 02:56:54,680
oh he's a mage yeah we hate mages honestly there's so annoying

1541
02:56:58,120 --> 02:57:05,320
male version of ime oh i mean ow i keep getting wrecked by these traps like i've like forgotten

1542
02:57:05,320 --> 02:57:11,000
them all right we'll finish this quest and then i will get some food in me because i'm probably

1543
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:15,160
moments from perishing uh you can just grab this key but here by the way super easy um

1544
02:57:15,400 --> 02:57:20,440
um i totally didn't know that on my first playthrough and walked all the way back uh

1545
02:57:21,240 --> 02:57:27,160
like a dumb dumb no i don't want to steal from it it's honestly kind of picking up stolen items

1546
02:57:27,160 --> 02:57:33,240
is really annoying if the guards end up picking you up right we've done it we've done the quest

1547
02:57:33,240 --> 02:57:38,120
once we finish we'll take a look if you need to sample some of the finest mead in skyline

1548
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:44,920
that your shift hasn't even started yet when i'm hello well it's about time

1549
02:57:45,960 --> 02:57:50,040
you'll just have to wait until after the camp right we're gonna watch it all we're gonna

1550
02:57:50,040 --> 02:57:58,280
watch it all in furl lydia go take a seat there lydia go sit lydia sit

02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:13,720
now that you've taken care of your i said go sit you're ruining the view lydia even though you

1553
02:58:13,720 --> 02:58:20,920
look just like me it's my finest room yet i call it the hate game from 2011 are you planning on

1556
02:58:34,280 --> 02:58:39,800
ring so i do apologize to anyone who hates elton ring i will probably have like a shorter stream

1557
02:58:39,800 --> 02:58:48,520
and maybe do like a membership stream as well and switch it up maybe she doesn't like to be told

1558
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:51,400
sit she's not a good girl bad girl

1559
02:58:51,400 --> 02:59:01,480
i don't understand silence idiot i should have known that actually well i'm here can we maybe

1560
02:59:02,840 --> 02:59:10,280
just turn the music down a tiny bit yeah it's a bit overwhelming you're like in fights and stuff

1561
02:59:11,560 --> 02:59:16,840
this is not what it seems but bouncing are we actually doing but bouncing i don't know

1562
02:59:17,800 --> 02:59:23,240
have you done it i feel like i want to like race to get us to do the dlc i don't i assume you get

1563
02:59:23,240 --> 02:59:29,000
the dlc once you've finished the game slamming our way through the lines in between with me to

1564

dragons reach we'll see how quickly your memory clears in the city's prisons now move look i assure

1566
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:56,600
oh oh dear what is it now we have a tasting to attend to nothing you're supposed to go with him

1567
02:59:58,360 --> 03:00:04,920
bad girls are incredibly good girls are the future i don't think that could have gone

1568
03:00:04,920 --> 03:00:14,040

1596
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:42,840
gullama not to be confused with golem a don't get me wrong you could scam a beggar

1597
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:49,240
how about i recite the work even more and oh i reduced the work even more and chew it for me

1598
03:03:49,240 --> 03:03:55,800
do you know that's how um used to food babies back in the day um it's actually really common for the

1599
03:03:55,800 --> 03:04:05,800
mums to chew the food and then give it to the um sorry um yeah so like before baby formula was a

1600
03:04:05,800 --> 03:04:12,040
thing and like solid food training or whatever like before the again a capitalism market kind of

1601
03:04:12,040 --> 03:04:18,280
exploded went to hear about what nesli did um yeah it was like really common your mom

1602
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:22,520
chose the food for you and then gives it to you in your mouth it's like a little baby bird moment

1603
03:04:22,520 --> 03:04:27,400
and everyone's like that's so gross and i was like bro that's the way it is it's just like how how

1604
03:04:27,400 --> 03:04:32,520
it be you know it's very interesting i actually could probably write an entire video i say about it

1605
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:36,920
and then present that video i say live on stream and just to show everyone how natural things are

1606
03:04:36,920 --> 03:04:41,320
but everything's been so like oh they're so weird but it's only weird because we've not been exposed

1607
03:04:41,400 --> 03:04:45,720
and we no longer even talk about it because it's like literally unironically being bred out of us

1608
03:04:45,720 --> 03:04:52,360
over a few generations because capitalism is away um what one fun world stroney did you consider

1609
03:04:52,360 --> 03:05:01,720
getting mana as backup food yeah mummy bird and literally i didn't know that was a thing it is so

1610
03:05:02,280 --> 03:05:10,040
um uh babies newborns should start on breast milk because it's full of colostrum um and it's

1611
03:05:10,040 --> 03:05:14,840
also because a baby doesn't actually have an immune system until six months old um so it's

1612
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:19,880
very important to have breast milk however um it was very common to have what's called a wet nurse

1613
03:05:19,880 --> 03:05:25,800
which is when um a woman who had recently had a child uh would share um because it's very common

1614
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:31,720
for some women to experience a surplus and it's very common for some women to experience uh

1615
03:05:31,720 --> 03:05:36,600
problems producing milk it's just kind of random doesn't really there's a lot of factors that come

1616
03:05:36,600 --> 03:05:42,040
into play um obviously stress is a major one stress on any human body for a long period do you

1617
03:05:42,040 --> 03:05:51,080
mind i'm telling a story about tiddy milk leave me alone um but yes uh i'm sure as a lot of you

1618
03:05:51,080 --> 03:05:57,160
can imagine being stressed for a very long time is very bad for your health um guys uh guys uh

1619
03:05:57,160 --> 03:06:03,960
stress manifests in a lot of mental health issues and a lot of loneliness um

1620
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:13,240
um oh are we gonna make it you know what we're gonna send it send it right hold on hold on

1621
03:06:13,240 --> 03:06:16,520
let them fake them out a little fake them out fake them out fake them out it's fine

1622
03:06:17,800 --> 03:06:25,560
wow wait wrong one oh shit i'm out of stamina and he's like right next to me this is rather

1623
03:06:25,560 --> 03:06:31,720
embarrassing i have to admit uh i didn't really think this far through yeah stress got me pretty good

1624
03:06:31,720 --> 03:06:37,800
yeah i like it here because i learned so much information okay there we go we can get away

1625
03:06:39,080 --> 03:06:44,760
worse i hear it i don't see it i think that's good that i don't see it though because it means it's

1626
03:06:44,760 --> 03:06:50,280
not near me don't call me out like that yeah it's very um interest in the way it physically

1627
03:06:50,280 --> 03:06:54,760
manifests in the way like obviously i think the majority of us have been like raised in a western

1628
03:06:54,760 --> 03:07:00,120
society which obviously comes with a lot of socialization and socialization plays so much

1629
03:07:00,120 --> 03:07:06,680
into the how you can deal with stress factors and like it's just kind of a sad fact that like

1630
03:07:06,680 --> 03:07:12,520
homeboys uh kind of get told to suck it up um like i can literally go greeting to the girls

1631
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:17,560
right now and it's like nothing nothing's wrong with it or anything um but it's very interesting

1632
03:07:17,560 --> 03:07:21,000
how you tackle it i don't even know how you tackle it i wouldn't even have a clue where you start

1633
03:07:21,800 --> 03:07:26,600
like the only thing i guess you could hope for is pockets of communities and over time ideas get

1634
03:07:26,600 --> 03:07:33,720
popular like um when the general consensus of society changes that's when the real change comes

1635
03:07:33,720 --> 03:07:39,320
through but the problem is you have to basically go out with the old and how do you go out with the

1636
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:46,360
old well the the old passes away the old doesn't bring down it bring down the old doesn't pass on

1637
03:07:46,360 --> 03:07:52,840
its teachings like for example um i like my grandparents talked about how they got hit by

1638
03:07:52,840 --> 03:07:57,880
their parents um it was a very common place to be hit if you didn't know it's actually illegal

1639
03:07:57,880 --> 03:08:04,360
to punish your child via a corporal punishment yes your own child in scotland is legal and you

1640
03:08:04,360 --> 03:08:09,160
will be prosecuted for hitting them no it is not punishment no it is not spanking no it is

1641
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:13,720
literally against the law you're welcome to go up and it's very bad for the child

1642
03:08:13,800 --> 03:08:23,640
there's a lot of things done around it um but it's very fascinating um how quickly things can

1643
03:08:23,640 --> 03:08:28,200
change within a generation so my grandparents told me stories about them getting hit by their parents

1644
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:34,840
they did not hit my parents like they didn't hit mom and dad and then you know opposites i didn't

1645
03:08:34,840 --> 03:08:42,760
hit mom and dad and mom or dad so my mom spanked me so my dad never hit me he doesn't like it he

1646
03:08:42,760 --> 03:08:50,680
doesn't believe in it and he absolutely despises it my mom so there was this orange slipper

1647
03:08:50,680 --> 03:08:55,480
and she used to hit me with it all the time because it was such a low child um

1648
03:08:57,160 --> 03:09:05,800
but it's very interesting because um within a couple of generations in scotland it's a big

1649
03:09:05,800 --> 03:09:11,640
no no to discipline your children via punishment like that physical punishment um and it's just

1650
03:09:11,640 --> 03:09:16,360
like interesting to see as the generations come and go like some people might not like the emphasis

1651
03:09:16,360 --> 03:09:21,720
like oh if you're in this age range you're gen x if you're in this you're a zoomer you're this you're

1652
03:09:21,720 --> 03:09:29,240
that but the reason it is so purposeful and so important to have these names for generations

1653
03:09:29,240 --> 03:09:40,120
is because there's also a lot of societal behaviors that emerge i hear nin root i hear it yes um and

1654
03:09:41,080 --> 03:09:48,120
uh so like you who are listening to me right now odds are we were not raised in the exact same

1655
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:57,320
society with the expectations and whatever's however we are crazy enough to have the ability

1656
03:09:57,320 --> 03:10:06,520
to set up a community like main where we may agree on how things like should go and how things

1657
03:10:06,520 --> 03:10:18,440
shouldn't go and we have created a pocket a pocket of a collective that can provide secondary

1658
03:10:18,440 --> 03:10:25,080
socialization which is crazy because primary socialization is your parents but secondary is

1659
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:30,520
like outside outside influence and i could influence you to see the world differently

1660
03:10:30,520 --> 03:10:36,920
through my words which is like insane um even we might not even be in the same generation and it's

1661
03:10:36,920 --> 03:10:42,120
just as freaking socialization is fantastic stuff i will also probably write a massive stream essay

1662
03:10:42,120 --> 03:10:47,320
i would love to talk about all this stuff in higher detail but right now we're about to do the thieves

1663
03:10:47,320 --> 03:10:53,320
quest and i've forgotten again to get food but that's okay we're just gonna sneak on in

1683
03:12:54,200 --> 03:13:00,200

1684
03:13:13,400 --> 03:13:16,200
so

1685
03:22:43,400 --> 03:23:08,520
What shenanigans did you get up to whilst I took a big fat Joby?

1686
03:23:08,520 --> 03:23:16,920
Okay, I've got food, lads she's been gone for 84 years, I've not, I've not, I've been

1687
03:23:16,920 --> 03:23:17,920
good.

1688
03:23:17,920 --> 03:23:20,360
Like, none of it's true.

1689
03:23:20,360 --> 03:23:24,280
I got cola, I got a tea and I got food, I'm so happy.

1690
03:23:24,280 --> 03:23:25,280
A what now?

1691
03:23:25,280 --> 03:23:34,960
Like, all I'm saying is the kettle was boiled and the microwave had microwaved, okay.

1692
03:23:34,960 --> 03:23:37,640
We talked about the happening.

1693
03:23:37,640 --> 03:23:39,480
She's back, I am back.

1694
03:23:39,480 --> 03:23:45,040
And I have food, a nice tab out and look at marshmallows or is this gonna break the

1695
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:46,040
game?

1696
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:50,880
Wouldn't that be hilarious if it broke the game and I had to redo it all over it then?

1697
03:23:50,880 --> 03:23:54,560
Oh my god that would be so funny, please don't do that.

1698
03:23:54,560 --> 03:23:58,560
Where's my mouse?

1699
03:23:58,560 --> 03:23:59,560
Got this?

1700
03:23:59,560 --> 03:24:00,560
Okay, we're back.

1701
03:24:00,560 --> 03:24:02,560
How do I open up marshmallow?

1702
03:24:02,560 --> 03:24:15,400
We're just gonna be stuffing our faces for a couple of minutes so I'll read marshmallow.

1703
03:24:15,400 --> 03:24:21,640
The toes, the toes from the stream the other day hit all the right spots, thank you so

1704
03:24:21,640 --> 03:24:25,640
much for caring to your people's desires.

1705
03:24:25,640 --> 03:24:31,960
I had quite a bit of spicy time, can't wait to see more of those toesies, oh you'll be

1706
03:24:31,960 --> 03:24:44,760
excited for tomorrow's stream, oh my god, oh that's funny as anything.

1707
03:24:44,760 --> 03:24:51,760
I want to him in your curls, my curls, my curled toes?

1708
03:24:51,760 --> 03:24:59,960
Wow, when you tape you keep your hand on the WASD keys, you're a true gamer, typical

1709
03:24:59,960 --> 03:25:03,960
people keep it ASDF, do they have that WASD?

1710
03:25:03,960 --> 03:25:11,120
Oh my god, I can't believe it, I'm a nerd, you've caught me.

1711
03:25:11,120 --> 03:25:15,360
You have the most beautiful tiny hands in the world, yeah some people said my hands

1712
03:25:15,360 --> 03:25:22,840
were small, I'm not, I don't actually, I think my hands are the average size for a

1713
03:25:22,840 --> 03:25:27,520
Whammon, I thought, I don't even think funny, I actually thought I was like bang on average

1714
03:25:27,520 --> 03:25:34,720
for everything, but I guess I'm not and I'm actually on the smaller side, they are tiny,

1715
03:25:34,720 --> 03:25:40,000
oh okay, like when I got the ruler out, oh sorry I just punched the microphone, when

1716
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:46,880
I got the ruler out I thought that was really fun because everyone can kinda, WASD is natural

1717
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:57,120
hand position, yeah I definitely agree with that, mm-hmm, God you have no idea how badly

1718
03:25:57,120 --> 03:26:03,560
I want to hold my hand, I should come to a convention then, I'll have, I'll get a body

1719
03:26:03,560 --> 03:26:12,320
guard just to make sure everything's all above ground, but yeah I can bring all damn things,

1720
03:26:12,320 --> 03:26:16,720
I don't know, I feel like if someone comes to a convention to come see you, I like the

1721
03:26:16,720 --> 03:26:21,160
idol meetings, like the Japanese idol meetings where they hold your hand and you can talk

1722
03:26:21,160 --> 03:26:25,360
and look at each other over the table type thing, I think that's really sweet and cute,

1723
03:26:25,440 --> 03:26:32,960
but I don't know, I don't know, it just seems like something, I dunno, it's just me, mm-hmm,

1724
03:26:35,520 --> 03:26:40,640
the ASMR booth if only, I wish a convention would entertain me to do that, that's honestly

1725
03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:51,520
ridiculous, make sure everything's above the table honestly, who would get in trouble first,

1726
03:26:51,520 --> 03:27:00,480
me or you, me or everyone, let me analyze this one,

1727
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:06,560
hey Strony, is there any chance for a hypnosis with helping the listener with addiction

1728
03:27:07,520 --> 03:27:12,160
or focusing desires upon yourself from distractions, um,

1729
03:27:12,320 --> 03:27:19,680
oh I'm not sure I can do stuff like that, mine is always of an alternative nature

1730
03:27:20,880 --> 03:27:33,760
for grat of the defying nature, I absolutely am not qualified or capable or doing anything that

1731
03:27:34,400 --> 03:27:45,600
kind of has like a, I don't know what the word is, but like I, therapeutic, yeah I would say

1732
03:27:46,320 --> 03:27:53,440
any therapeutic hypnosis I can't participate in because I don't actually have the knowledge

1733
03:27:53,440 --> 03:28:00,080
on who goes there, how to do it safely, so safety first I will admit this is out of my

1734
03:28:00,960 --> 03:28:05,840
league, I am definitely not there and I don't think I ever will be there, um 10 out of 10,

1735
03:28:05,840 --> 03:28:11,040
9 out of 10, holy moly, oh yeah, oh did you forget when I eat I burp even more, that's right,

1736
03:28:11,040 --> 03:28:19,600
the air gets trapped in these lungs, eh lungs in this stomach, I gave you my tribute cherry

1737
03:28:19,600 --> 03:28:26,320
and no one else, you're the only woman to ever, ah

1738
03:28:32,720 --> 03:28:36,000
these are supposed to be special, I have a mindset in the first place, oh I don't

1739
03:28:36,000 --> 03:28:41,200
ever feel like forced to or anything, but I do like that, I took your cherry,

1740
03:28:44,240 --> 03:28:48,240
hi Strony, just finished watching your sweet stream and I have to say those sweets are not

1741
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:54,640
as sweet as you, those sweets aren't as sweet as you, hey, oh okay we'll give you that one,

1742
03:28:54,640 --> 03:29:00,720
that was cute, okay that was cute, every journal joke I know though, also did you know that the

1743
03:29:00,720 --> 03:29:05,840
bumps on the F and J keys on your keyboard are there so you can correctly place your hands

1744
03:29:05,840 --> 03:29:13,920
fingers on them without looking or touching, I thought the WASD was funny, I didn't know that,

1745
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:18,960
you have taught me knowledge, everyone please finger the F key and notice the bump on the F

1746
03:29:18,960 --> 03:29:29,360
that is for positioning reasons, and in light of recent events the girls have made it clear

1747
03:29:29,360 --> 03:29:37,040
they don't want our unfaithful scene, even with your permission if they are reciprocal

1748
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:45,440
and dedication, I am happy for them and happy to oblige their wishes, however this means your

1749
03:29:46,880 --> 03:29:55,840
king will be ignored, my sharing, I'm trying to navigate this in a particular way, I think we

1750
03:29:55,840 --> 03:30:06,960
all know, I'm trying to get around it, I will just have to, I will have to, I can't say anything,

1751
03:30:07,520 --> 03:30:14,240
my tentacle is no once again for your exquisite news, oh I love that and only,

1752
03:30:20,080 --> 03:30:23,840
I can't read anything else over that, there we go finger in the F, yes

1753
03:30:37,520 --> 03:30:50,000
mmm yes, my sea queen, my sea queen yes, they can entertain my sea queen due to the girls

1754
03:30:51,520 --> 03:30:54,160
preference, yes

1755
03:30:59,200 --> 03:31:03,600
oh my god my pc, I don't know if it's because it's on standby but it's making the room

1756
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:11,120
unbelievably hot, hi cuddles, during this stream this morning you ask what a fumu was

1757
03:31:11,120 --> 03:31:15,120
in response to my comment about some plushies, they're basically smug plushies of popular

1758
03:31:15,120 --> 03:31:21,440
characters from the two whole series, however they have developed a bit of a cult following

1759
03:31:21,440 --> 03:31:25,520
due to memes and such and ended up with people making their own similar plushies like the

1760
03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:30,640
Neurosam and Evil Neurosam, oh okay okay from Makership, ah yeah yeah yes I see, I see thank you,

1761
03:31:32,960 --> 03:31:39,920
am I too big for you, oh that's that's a link, that's a link, we'll investigate that later on,

1762
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:46,240
hi Strony, thanks for the fun stream today, a lot of the American sweets did not look safe to eat

1763
03:31:46,240 --> 03:31:52,400
well but I'm glad you found a new thing you'd like, yeah Makin' Eggs, orange flavor, I'm all about that,

1764
03:31:53,360 --> 03:31:59,600
I'm all about the Makin' Eggs, I've always had a keen interest in hypno content, I'm very very curious

1765
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:05,200
to experience what you have to offer and even more intrigued by the idea of permanent info and

1766
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:11,840
I do have a reverse audio that will be publicly accessible, please don't worry, I've always thought

1767
03:32:11,840 --> 03:32:17,840
that hypnosis would never work on me and I'd like to give it a try, literally you, if it's not for you

1768
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:23,600
that's more than okay, I do offer like alternative like audios and stuff that aren't that theme but

1769
03:32:23,600 --> 03:32:28,560
if it's not for you please don't ever feel forced to like go along with it if that makes sense,

1770
03:32:28,560 --> 03:32:33,200
like either it's for you, you can give it a try, if you're open minded you'll see,

1771
03:32:38,480 --> 03:32:42,400
will you give us your best sometime, also you're quite, oh my god I'm choking on my lasagna,

1772
03:32:42,400 --> 03:32:47,360
you can hear it slide down my throat, also you're quite literally the cutest cop fish I've ever

1773
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:53,600
seen, thank you, you make me feel a certain kind of way with that voice of yours, oh yeah yeah,

1774
03:32:53,600 --> 03:32:59,600
like this, top, why do I say top of the morning, is this one not scott's, good morning, good evening,

1775
03:32:59,600 --> 03:33:04,800
good afternoon, right today we're playing Skyrim, that's right, Skyrim belongs to the north,

1776
03:33:05,200 --> 03:33:12,720
oh someone says it, someone says I never thought I'd be too big for my beloved,

1777
03:33:12,720 --> 03:33:19,680
I don't know how to handle this information, pick the other hole, it's really not that,

1778
03:33:19,680 --> 03:33:26,320
it's not that hard, actually I encourage you very much, please don't worry,

1779
03:33:28,560 --> 03:33:31,600
I will, I will teach you the ways in the membership stream,

1780
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:45,120
I love your content, hope to see more, I'm in the process of making a short story for you,

1781
03:33:45,120 --> 03:33:49,360
but now that I'm halfway done with it, I'm on the verge of scrapping it, no, pure shame, no,

1782
03:33:51,120 --> 03:33:55,280
if you ever, if ever saw the late day, I would need a new identity, it's not even explicit,

1783
03:33:55,280 --> 03:34:00,480
I use very loose words, but yeah maybe I shouldn't have brought it up, oh don't be scared to put your

1784
03:34:00,480 --> 03:34:05,360
creations into the, are you joking me, you know all the scripts that you've heard from the girls

1785
03:34:05,360 --> 03:34:11,680
so far, I wrote that, do you think I was proud of the first thing I ever wrote, no, don't scrap it,

1786
03:34:11,680 --> 03:34:26,320
let me read it, I want to read, I'm eating cauliflower that's coated in flavour,

1787
03:34:30,640 --> 03:34:39,520
hmm, um, I'm so sorry, hi scrawny ass in the stream, but looks like it's in past chat,

1788
03:34:39,520 --> 03:34:46,720
what's the model of your keyboard, uh, uh, Corsair, something, I think it's the,

1789
03:34:48,400 --> 03:34:55,280
it's the Australian version because the number two is the at key, which is actually the wrong key

1790
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:56,720
in the UK,

1791
03:35:02,960 --> 03:35:07,760
this is delicious, this is exactly what I need to stream for 12 hours,

1792
03:35:13,760 --> 03:35:16,320
hey scrawny, just want to say I'm glad that Vealer is up and running,

1793
03:35:17,520 --> 03:35:22,800
um, I've been following since another life and really enjoyed her refresh and your content is,

1794
03:35:22,880 --> 03:35:29,520
that's because I'm unprofessional, so happy to see your dreams come into life and bring in the

1795
03:35:29,520 --> 03:35:34,720
V-trip and, flash-trip and re-re-e together, I feel like what you're doing is really breaking

1796
03:35:34,720 --> 03:35:40,800
out in your character, oh shucks, you stop that, you're, you're, you're blowing,

1797
03:35:41,520 --> 03:35:45,600
smoke up my arse, I am getting my ego stroke so hard, what's going on here,

1798
03:35:46,640 --> 03:35:48,960
um, new character, I'd love to see it, can't wait to watch you all in the rest of the

1799
03:35:49,520 --> 03:35:55,520
years to come, you stop that, I hope they all continue to achieve their dreams, I do too,

1800
03:35:55,520 --> 03:36:03,360
my next goal, once everyone, who goes there, once everyone is monetized, um, we will get,

1801
03:36:04,720 --> 03:36:11,200
um, my next goal is to get them all to 5k subscribers because we have a celebratory artwork

1802
03:36:11,200 --> 03:36:19,440
for that when everyone achieves it, so I'm very excited, oh, it has to be there forever,

1803
03:36:20,640 --> 03:36:23,920
me who has to think of the second, uh, video game for Gen2,

1804
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:27,920
MonkaS, I don't even know if anyone's going to like my idea, but here we go,

1812
03:37:16,960 --> 03:37:23,440
hey, hey, and under this color, I know you like whimpering, there you are, who told you that,

1813
03:37:24,080 --> 03:37:30,240
but what should you take on talking during gifts, example calling you a good,

1814
03:37:30,800 --> 03:37:38,640
be sucky, the best little, if you want to do that, go for it, yeah,

1815
03:37:41,760 --> 03:37:49,600
oh my, yeah, if you want to say that stuff, go for it, I ain't gonna say no,

1816
03:37:50,560 --> 03:38:03,760
hey, strongy, I'm a skit, so refling, oh, bless your heart, are you okay, son,

1817
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:10,000
is there any way to retract my mod application, oh, if you get picked for a mod, don't worry,

1818
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:16,400
you can just reject it at any point, if you get that offer, oh, bless, yeah, I hope you're okay,

1819
03:38:16,400 --> 03:38:21,280
but I don't trust myself with that kind of power, that's really good on you to, uh, be able to see

1820
03:38:21,280 --> 03:38:27,600
that maybe it's not the best idea for you, good on you, skit, so refling, god, the way, it's just,

1821
03:38:27,600 --> 03:38:34,560
it's how direct you identified yourself that was kind of humorous, sorry, I do apologize,

1822
03:38:34,560 --> 03:38:38,880
I'm not laughing at you, I actually just found it, just like, hey, I'm skit, so refling, like, you just,

1823
03:38:38,880 --> 03:38:43,520
you just, like, slammed your boars on the desk because of the, just like, yeah, let's get straight

1824
03:38:43,520 --> 03:38:49,120
to the point, um, so sorry, that was rather humorous the way you wrote that, yes, please just reject

1825
03:38:49,120 --> 03:38:57,040
the offer, if you do get messaged about it, I actually have no idea, uh, mommy, please, I wanna,

1826
03:38:57,040 --> 03:39:07,840
hmm, while listening to you, hmm, hi, Strani, I just wanna say thank you, thank you so much,

1827
03:39:07,840 --> 03:39:11,680
Reeler, I'm really, really happy you're back, but I'm also happy for the other girls too, I am too,

1828
03:39:11,680 --> 03:39:17,040
they're also sweet and talented, oh, I know they are, absolutely adore them,

1829
03:39:19,680 --> 03:39:26,080
I can't read that one out loud because that's very, that's very, uh, maybe in a membership

1830
03:39:26,080 --> 03:39:33,840
room, I tried suggesting another man to make you his new Oshi because he was an old-school

1831
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:41,840
runescape addict, when he's out of the picture, I'll swoop in on his wife, not that I'm trying,

1832
03:39:41,840 --> 03:39:48,880
well, what, what are you saying, you're trying to get, what, you're trying to get me an old-school

1833
03:39:48,880 --> 03:39:53,440
runescape sugar daddy, I've, none of you have seen the runescape series so far, there's just one

1834
03:39:53,440 --> 03:40:04,160
installment, oh, shit, management just showed up, everyone front and center, I, I, I'm serious,

1835
03:40:04,160 --> 03:40:07,840
you can also contact the website and mention the email you used in the mod application to get it

1836
03:40:07,840 --> 03:40:15,120
removed, okay, yeah, that seems fair, um, uh, what was I saying, oh yeah, I literally have like 22

1837
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:18,400
million gp and all I did was show up in freaking fish,

1838
03:40:24,160 --> 03:40:27,760
hi cuddles, I'm currently watching the mod of today's ace marstream since I missed it while

1839
03:40:27,760 --> 03:40:35,520
sleeping, I'm someone who has never been able to go under despite having a, having a flavor for it,

1840
03:40:35,920 --> 03:40:40,160
so, one issue I have that I become,

1841
03:40:42,720 --> 03:40:48,960
hysterical, I can't read that, um, uh,

1842
03:40:53,520 --> 03:40:55,760
uh-huh, okay,

1843
03:40:59,120 --> 03:41:03,360
okay, we have quite an effect on this replay, that's adorable, I like that,

1844
03:41:04,240 --> 03:41:06,560
I'm managing with quick hands above desk honestly,

1845
03:41:08,320 --> 03:41:15,920
hi, I love you mom, I love you to everything, the stream was incredible, I'm really glad that

1846
03:41:15,920 --> 03:41:19,600
I interest you and I can't wait to see what you do next, also I'm still here and she'd be streamed

1847
03:41:19,600 --> 03:41:26,160
for you, I'm devoted to you, I really want to send you something, but I haven't had the inspiration

1848
03:41:26,160 --> 03:41:32,800
been really in my, my emotions lately and it's really slammed my libido, do I know a sad fact,

1849
03:41:32,800 --> 03:41:40,720
my alternative picture is the last time, rip in the chat, I've been so freaking stressed like

1850
03:41:40,720 --> 03:41:49,120
all the time and I can't like unstress myself, I think it'll calm down like once the thing

1851
03:41:49,840 --> 03:41:52,640
but like I'm so freaking stressed and it's such a shame,

1852
03:42:00,160 --> 03:42:07,040
but I'm sure I will get inspiration soon, I think maybe, I'll tell you what, I think maybe once

1853
03:42:07,040 --> 03:42:13,280
the monetization for everyone has been achieved, I'll start to feel relaxed because like then truly

1854
03:42:13,280 --> 03:42:16,960
is up to the girls, whatever they want to do and I can just get fun shorts ordered of them,

1855
03:42:17,760 --> 03:42:23,120
but like right now I'm like, oh my god there's four out of six, why is the other two not come

1856
03:42:23,120 --> 03:42:26,960
through because we applied for them all at the same time, like oh no weapons of one of the girls

1857
03:42:26,960 --> 03:42:32,000
don't get YouTube monetization, oh no that's like a whole month and uh just like oh I don't,

1858
03:42:32,000 --> 03:42:36,400
oh I would be sick if I think about it, we pretend we do not see,

1859
03:42:36,720 --> 03:42:48,640
but yeah, the, what did I just say, there's a line of volunteers is extremely long, thank,

1860
03:42:49,680 --> 03:42:51,520
yeah you guys want to make gentry right now?

1861
03:42:58,400 --> 03:43:03,600
I've almost finished eating and then I will slurp my honey tea and then we'll get back into

1862
03:43:03,600 --> 03:43:22,000
the thieves guild, Skyrim's going good, we're at um Gollum from the thieves guild quest,

1863
03:43:22,880 --> 03:43:29,520
we're about to be meeting the big naughty on who's trying to take down the thieves guild

1864
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:38,480
soon to him and then once we do the thieves guild we are going to do the dark brotherhood

1865
03:43:38,480 --> 03:43:42,960
because I actually really enjoy it, it's quite, I think the dark brotherhood is actually relatively

1866
03:43:42,960 --> 03:43:50,560
quick um and then we're going to do the vampires and then if we still have time we're going to do

1867
03:43:51,360 --> 03:43:57,840
um the actual dragonborn quest line which I hate doing because it breaks the game

1868
03:43:58,400 --> 03:44:02,720
and if you ever like seriously want to do like a hundred percent speed run,

1869
03:44:02,720 --> 03:44:06,560
eh speed run, not speed run, just a hundred percent achievements, always leave it last

1870
03:44:06,560 --> 03:44:13,680
because it breaks the game so much when you have to like say like oh we'll give white run up or we'll

1871
03:44:13,680 --> 03:44:19,840
give this uh rifting up or we'll do this or we'll do that, every detail of how much it breaks the

1872
03:44:19,840 --> 03:44:32,400
game, but I finished my my bowl of lasagna, um now I've got my cup of tea and my cola, I do, I do,

1873
03:44:32,400 --> 03:44:38,240
I've got my cola, no need to read this during a stream, oh yeah what happens if I do it right now

1874
03:44:39,200 --> 03:44:46,960
the ASMR stream was amazing strongy, I was putting your hands during it, ah that's so cute

1875
03:44:47,760 --> 03:44:49,760
hmm

1876
03:44:52,640 --> 03:44:59,440
I'm giving you, oh whoa someone is giving me a step by step

1877
03:45:01,200 --> 03:45:05,440
gate on how to do haptic feedback

1878
03:45:05,440 --> 03:45:16,000
inalize, inalizing, okay that's the law links, um how down bad do you think is too down bad for

1879
03:45:16,000 --> 03:45:19,440
you, for me, oh no I like, I like main corruption

1880
03:45:22,240 --> 03:45:31,040
so there's not really a down too bad, I think corruption's really um up there um oh my first

1881
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:35,920
membership stream can be about that, no about ranking everything

1882
03:45:41,920 --> 03:45:52,480
inalize, yes, oh strongy, I just want to thank you for giving all the girls a home and a family,

1883
03:45:52,480 --> 03:45:56,960
Vila are such a positive part of the environment already and I'm happy to watch along with all

1884
03:45:57,040 --> 03:46:02,880
the other reflins, oh reflin, I said also the latest patreon post is incredible,

1885
03:46:03,760 --> 03:46:09,040
did you like it, I thought it was good, would you let me pick on your party

1886
03:46:11,680 --> 03:46:18,080
yes if you are a patreon member um another audio has gone up so there's a total of three audios

1887
03:46:18,080 --> 03:46:24,720
up, um it is spaced out for the other girls so because all the audios were uploaded on the first

1888
03:46:24,800 --> 03:46:29,760
that did mean there's a bit of a break between the next one that comes up but as it stands

1889
03:46:29,760 --> 03:46:42,320
everyone has a day, if I can remember correctly Azura, Monday, Mercy, Tuesday, um Emmy, Weddin's Day,

1890
03:46:42,320 --> 03:46:56,400
Shebe, Thursday, AC, Friday, strongy, Saturday, I'm not quite sure but just so you understand

1891
03:46:56,400 --> 03:47:08,080
they are purposefully spaced out who goes there and um they will be like every Tuesday

1892
03:47:08,080 --> 03:47:14,480
all of X's will go out on every Tuesday all of like for me every Saturday an audio will come out

1893
03:47:14,480 --> 03:47:22,160
like that kind of thing um we I'm going to get the girls to post on what's inside like with the

1894
03:47:22,160 --> 03:47:29,840
tags and everything I just need catch up time um she says as she's sitting on Skyrim for an

1895
03:47:29,840 --> 03:47:35,040
endurance stream I've got nothing but the cheek I really do I've got nothing but the cheek but

1896
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:44,000
I do need catch up time to get into the floor things then next month um 100% will be like you

1897
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:49,920
will see what's inside if you want to subscribe for that month or not and if not then you know you

1898
03:47:49,920 --> 03:47:55,280
can take a look at whoever else is posting maybe they've got something a bit more up to your style

1899
03:47:55,280 --> 03:48:00,080
again I would like to repeat when it comes to the audios I have not shoehorned anyone into the

1900
03:48:00,080 --> 03:48:08,160
same type of plot if you will because that will not financially enable them to be the

1901
03:48:08,160 --> 03:48:13,440
content creator they'd like to be um a lot of the girls are looking at moving out possibly if

1902
03:48:13,440 --> 03:48:18,000
they're able to receive enough support so that's why I do say if you only have enough money to

1903
03:48:18,000 --> 03:48:26,640
support one girl please do pick a daughter of mine because um they are gunning to move out um

1904
03:48:27,360 --> 03:48:35,520
and it means they would provide more content and yeah it's just a very positive cycle occurs um

1905
03:48:36,880 --> 03:48:44,960
yes uh yeah I'm both meanies like not bad just to kill it by emoji if you subscribe to everyone

1906
03:48:44,960 --> 03:48:51,040
you get an audio every day I mean technically you're very close you get a rest day no one uploads

1907
03:48:51,040 --> 03:48:59,120
on a sunday also they deserve it yes the girls work incredibly hard um AC was like am I allowed

1908
03:48:59,120 --> 03:49:04,240
someone asked a question to AC on marshmallow like uh how do your recordings work and she was like

1909
03:49:04,240 --> 03:49:09,360
am I allowed to talk about this and I'm like yeah you can as long as you don't see anything that's

1910
03:49:09,360 --> 03:49:15,600
like NDA obvious then yeah you can talk about how I I burst into your DMs and hand you a script and

1911
03:49:15,600 --> 03:49:20,960
all the spelling is wrong and the grammar's whack yeah you can talk about that all you like I say

1912
03:49:23,920 --> 03:49:32,960
actual day of rest honestly um but yes thank you for thanking me for giving the girls a home

1913
03:49:32,960 --> 03:49:40,000
but please understand the girls did it themselves they reached out to vealer they applied um they

1914
03:49:40,000 --> 03:49:43,920
went to an interview and they were happy with everything some of them did the very thorough

1915
03:49:43,920 --> 03:49:51,120
research uh Emmy actually was the most inquisitive and had the most questions Azura I think she was

1916
03:49:51,120 --> 03:49:56,160
just like is any of this real I think she thought she was dreaming because she never asked a single

1917
03:49:56,160 --> 03:50:04,160
question after the interview um yeah Azura was absolutely adorable Emmy asked a ton of questions

1918
03:50:04,160 --> 03:50:08,720
which made me think she wasn't actually gonna accept the character because I told her what the

1919
03:50:08,720 --> 03:50:16,480
character's theme was and I saw people were being weird but yeah Azura was like fuck it we ball

1920
03:50:16,480 --> 03:50:23,520
NDA and the dogs did not withstand and they have carte blanche what carte blanche

1921
03:50:24,240 --> 03:50:33,760
but what uh in English what in English English that's so Azura honestly yeah this one's like

1922
03:50:34,720 --> 03:50:45,440
big mommy we ball honestly a free pass or it means like free reign oh carte blanche a blank menu

1923
03:50:46,080 --> 03:50:53,200
is what the translation is that makes sense a free pass a blank menu oh my god I can't believe it

1924
03:50:53,200 --> 03:50:58,080
sorry I translated it literally versus uh metaphor good uh

1925
03:50:58,560 --> 03:51:05,120
hi sending messages scares me but I want I watched your ASMR stream and it was amazing

1926
03:51:05,120 --> 03:51:09,520
I can't wait to see more of your stuff both ASMR and other videos they're so fantastic I'm watching you

1927
03:51:10,560 --> 03:51:16,800
do what you love and making ASMR making via lure has me thinking I should start and follow my

1928
03:51:16,800 --> 03:51:21,680
you should follow your own dreams you've only got one shot I keep snail blinking please Paul

1929
03:51:21,680 --> 03:51:25,760
please don't notice me snail blinking you do you've only got one shot if you've got a dream

1930
03:51:25,760 --> 03:51:31,040
or something you want to achieve where can go for it like if I win the lottery already know what I'm

1931
03:51:31,040 --> 03:51:37,600
doing all I'm saying is if I win the lottery the girls are getting stacked out so I'm saying um

1932
03:51:38,560 --> 03:51:44,400
you know the split going even higher you know oh it's always fun to try and reach for a new goal

1933
03:51:44,400 --> 03:51:49,280
like for example hypnosis is my new goal I've always enjoyed it and always liked it but I've

1934
03:51:49,280 --> 03:51:53,920
never made it myself because like I'm just like not skilled and I need to make sure it's safe

1935
03:51:53,920 --> 03:51:59,200
and all that sorry I'm trying to wait there's a fucking cat hair on my face and it's one of

1936
03:51:59,200 --> 03:52:04,160
those cat hairs where you wipe it away and then it does a 360 look back on wherever it's freaking

1937
03:52:04,160 --> 03:52:14,480
a caption I'm so sorry that'll be gimley honestly um but you honestly you placed everyone in their

1938
03:52:14,480 --> 03:52:20,960
spots so well I wouldn't picture anyone else yes there is right no I'm not gonna say it because

1939
03:52:21,040 --> 03:52:26,880
I might start up some shitters um and we ain't stirring the pot from these parts we tap the

1940
03:52:26,880 --> 03:52:36,640
sign from these parts um let's see hi strongy could you give us a hearing test like hearing

1941
03:52:36,640 --> 03:52:46,080
test ASMR of course I can do something like that for ya you do a 360 and walk away wait a minute

1942
03:52:46,160 --> 03:52:54,880
a 180 oops wait no 360 is the circle 180 is the opposite right okay um I could absolutely

1943
03:52:54,880 --> 03:53:02,320
do a hearing test I did a ear cleaning where I'm like muffled until as the audio progresses I'm less

1944
03:53:02,320 --> 03:53:06,480
muffled I thought it was pretty cool I need to edit it actually it might be one of my one and four

1945
03:53:06,480 --> 03:53:12,320
because I owe you four this whole Skyrim stream actually kind of went perfect because tomorrow

1946
03:53:12,320 --> 03:53:19,200
I will do my monetization celebration stream where everyone can absolutely laugh in I'm pretty

1947
03:53:19,200 --> 03:53:24,080
sure someone's probably already guessed what I've got planned for it there's no way after yesterday's

1948
03:53:24,080 --> 03:53:28,640
stream someone hasn't put two and two together and knows why I got a pedicure in particular

1949
03:53:29,520 --> 03:53:36,880
I refuse I refuse she fell for the oldest these eggs box joke honestly do a 540 believe it

1950
03:53:37,840 --> 03:53:44,000
um my body prevented me from my dreams so I come about have you ever had an actual medical

1951
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:51,120
ear cleaning I've not had a medical ear cleaning but I did get my hearing checked as a child um

1952
03:53:51,120 --> 03:53:57,680
because I was ignoring my mum where I was undiagnosed it was my idea actually um

1953
03:54:00,320 --> 03:54:02,720
I'm going to sip my tea before it gets too cold okay

1954
03:54:03,680 --> 03:54:12,080
eh yeah my mum got me uh sent her a hearing test because she was sitting on my dash she was like

1955
03:54:12,080 --> 03:54:17,520
scrawny doesn't he listen to me like scrawny scrawny never hears me and I used to do this thing

1956
03:54:17,520 --> 03:54:23,680
where I sat right in front of the tv so the tv was on a stand but I would sit directly under it so

1957
03:54:23,680 --> 03:54:28,720
my neck was looking directly upward sorry I just hit the mic there by yeah I know you can't see my

1958
03:54:28,720 --> 03:54:35,440
hands but my mic was at my mic my neck was directly upwards looking at the tv like pure pure in a

1959
03:54:35,440 --> 03:54:43,440
trance like straight up like Tism a doctor walked in and Tism was the diagnosis type thing and obviously

1960
03:54:43,440 --> 03:54:49,040
my mum didn't know what it was all about at the time so I got sent for a hearing test and she was

1961
03:54:49,040 --> 03:54:55,760
like the wife that did the hearing test on me she was like oh no pet you're here in Spain I don't know

1962
03:54:55,760 --> 03:55:03,040
what's going on with you um and yeah basically that was that's when the signs start to show

1963
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:08,880
and then now here I am someone who has to read and write for a living and goodness gravy is it

1964
03:55:08,880 --> 03:55:15,600
freaking hard I'm slurping is she okay nah she's just fucking hell autistic

1965
03:55:18,640 --> 03:55:25,360
a kid with autism how close were you to the tv oh I'm not being funny when I'm like I was

1966
03:55:25,360 --> 03:55:33,520
directly below the tv I like I was sitting crisscross looking directly up at the tv and my

1967
03:55:33,520 --> 03:55:43,600
neck was up in the air like and I and my mum ascertained that it was hearing issues rather than

1968
03:55:43,600 --> 03:55:49,280
something else what might be going on she had a case of strong autism honestly the strong

1969
03:55:49,760 --> 03:55:50,320
too strong

1970
03:55:53,360 --> 03:55:58,640
and that's not good for your eyes oh well I do actually need to be wearing my glicks but

1971
03:56:00,400 --> 03:56:06,000
I'm making it work okay I was right in the vtuber collab scripts and I was like this is too small

1972
03:56:06,000 --> 03:56:11,200
this takes so I zoomed in and I'm like oh my god I'm gonna be a blind as a fish like really soon

1973
03:56:11,200 --> 03:56:13,840
wait that's literally me as a kid literally

1974
03:56:13,840 --> 03:56:26,320
do you reckon cuttlefish have actual autism um as an uncertified marine biologist anything

1975
03:56:26,320 --> 03:56:31,600
is possible if you didn't know down syndrome is possible in animals as well um I believe

1976
03:56:31,600 --> 03:56:42,240
down syndrome is the deletion of chrome zone oh god was it in humans uh not 32 that's not right

1977
03:56:42,240 --> 03:56:46,160
I can't remember which deletion it is but it can happen in gorillas seriously I'm not even

1978
03:56:46,160 --> 03:56:51,280
kidding look up down soon down syndrome gorilla and like it's fucking creepy oh it's an extra

1979
03:56:51,280 --> 03:56:57,840
addition of 21 sorry yeah I'm thinking of the deletion one what is the deletion one called

1980
03:56:58,800 --> 03:57:06,960
that I always watch documentaries about it happens when life deletes 32 yes um actually

1981
03:57:07,040 --> 03:57:15,520
spindle fiber failure um uh which is I um I find it really interesting oh god yeah I feel like

1982
03:57:15,520 --> 03:57:20,960
every time I'm like I find this so interesting and fascinating it leads to me rambling about

1983
03:57:20,960 --> 03:57:26,240
something that you guys couldn't give less of a shit about I feel really bad but at the same

1984
03:57:26,240 --> 03:57:31,520
time I really like blabbing away so I'm like that just do it that just tell you about um

1985
03:57:31,520 --> 03:57:38,240
fertilization so the reason why the rate of down syndrome goes up dramatically the older

1986
03:57:38,240 --> 03:57:46,880
the woman is beyond the age of 25 yes the age of 25 um you're you're already hitting the wall at 25 rip

1987
03:57:46,880 --> 03:57:54,000
um the reason it goes up exponentially is because the failure of the spindle fibers that's what pulls

1988
03:57:54,000 --> 03:58:03,440
apart um that's what pulls it apart and then results in a the an additional chromosome wiggling

1989
03:58:03,440 --> 03:58:10,880
about which is the rise of down syndrome which is why women who um are having children later in life

1990
03:58:10,880 --> 03:58:20,160
are often advised to do what is referred to as a DNA test which I've completely forgotten the name of

1991
03:58:20,160 --> 03:58:26,000
but basically they pierce the amniotic sac and take a tiny cell sample of the baby and then check

1992
03:58:26,000 --> 03:58:31,600
its DNA sequence under um you know get it because to see if the child has done syndrome or not and

1993
03:58:31,600 --> 03:58:35,440
then either they're advised would you like to terminate or not or bring to term whatever

1994
03:58:36,000 --> 03:58:42,240
type thing goes on but um it definitely is a risk and uh like also being obese with the child as well

1995
03:58:42,240 --> 03:58:47,200
results in gestational diabetes which is very dangerous for the child very dangerous for the mom

1996
03:58:47,920 --> 03:58:56,560
um there's also um if depending on the blood type of the mother and the blood type of the child

1997
03:58:56,560 --> 03:59:04,800
the mother during the entire pregnancy her body can be attacking the baby until it has a natural

1998
03:59:05,440 --> 03:59:11,680
abortion if you didn't know abortion is the natural term but you can also get a medical abortion

1999
03:59:12,240 --> 03:59:15,440
but abortion is the natural term for it just happening

2000
03:59:16,400 --> 03:59:21,040
there are many reasons why it can never come to term how do you know all this stuff is fascinating

2001
03:59:21,040 --> 03:59:27,840
no I don't go to school I like watching youtube videos about um biology related things I have a

2002
03:59:27,840 --> 03:59:37,680
fascination in uh diagnoses in particular like why the reason it occurs for example um like uh

2003
03:59:37,680 --> 03:59:44,560
there's this syndrome uh of course it evades my mind I think it's called like William Hunter's

2004
03:59:44,560 --> 03:59:51,200
syndrome where the child or the well the child that can become an adult um because you you do not pass

2005
03:59:51,200 --> 03:59:56,640
away uh unless you have complications with other diseases for example um you will never experience

2006
03:59:56,640 --> 04:00:03,360
the sensation of being full uh you will constantly eat um there's like hereditary syndromes as well

2007
04:00:03,440 --> 04:00:11,840
like hunter syndrome which is pretty uh devastating and um there's interesting one such as dwarfism

2008
04:00:11,840 --> 04:00:19,360
dwarfism can actually be passed on by two individuals who visually do not have any um display of any

2009
04:00:19,360 --> 04:00:28,960
dwarf uh ism genetics um but it is a recessive gene and if the two people come together um yep

2010
04:00:28,960 --> 04:00:31,680
we can have it how do you know all this riefling that obviously has not got the

2011
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:43,840
angel man syndrome is that angel man syndrome is that the one where the child is locked in the

2012
04:00:43,840 --> 04:00:53,520
child like stay I believe so mentally they can't develop any further um uh yes uh Harley Quinn

2013
04:00:53,520 --> 04:00:58,240
syndrome um doesn't sound like what it is it's where your skin constantly your skin regenerates

2014
04:00:58,240 --> 04:01:04,640
so fast that you flake and you break and it's just absolute it is a living heck for those poor

2015
04:01:05,520 --> 04:01:12,880
like children that are born but you can make it to adulthood um there's a lot of sad um

2016
04:01:12,880 --> 04:01:18,560
diagnoses that you can get like you can get childhood dementia those are quite crushing ones um

2017
04:01:20,480 --> 04:01:26,160
stroneys institute for the gift to take that angel man is the eaten one is it Harley Quinn

2018
04:01:26,160 --> 04:01:34,560
it she was this year is dwarf ism classified only as being short there are a redonkulous

2019
04:01:34,560 --> 04:01:42,560
amount of dwarfism classifications um some can be like no stunted growth on the abdomen uh other

2020
04:01:42,560 --> 04:01:50,880
versions are no stunted growth on the arms and the legs but the um organ holder area if you will

2021
04:01:50,880 --> 04:01:56,000
for lack of better words abdomen all the interest in that like there's so many different classifications

2022
04:01:56,000 --> 04:02:02,960
is quite um it's quite fascinating stuff when she uh get into torso yeah torso will do just

2023
04:02:02,960 --> 04:02:08,160
nicely uh I remember when the photos of those babies were used as shock for yeah unfortunately um

2024
04:02:10,160 --> 04:02:17,120
kind of if you use older like if you look up like Freud's stuff for example you get quite a few

2025
04:02:17,120 --> 04:02:23,440
older photos that are like Freud Freud you didn't have to photograph that mate like you know do you

2026
04:02:23,440 --> 04:02:29,040
know about prisons yeah like the stanley prison experiment and how people play roles that they

2027
04:02:29,040 --> 04:02:37,040
perceive to be superior uh absolutely fascinating stuff I do enjoy the psychology I has to offer um

2028
04:02:38,320 --> 04:02:48,960
I think humans and our everyday socialization were always kind of it's always insinuated that

2029
04:02:48,960 --> 04:02:57,200
there's someone to look up to but I am a big believer in the three um three perspective

2030
04:02:57,200 --> 04:03:02,400
talk and it's like parent to parent child to child adult to parent or something like that

2031
04:03:02,960 --> 04:03:09,200
and it's like the three ways you can communicate with someone he said prions oh not prisons my

2032
04:03:09,200 --> 04:03:16,640
apology I was talking about the the stanley prison experiment prions uh no a little bit

2033
04:03:16,640 --> 04:03:22,240
about prions not not not too much sorry I just read what I wanted to read prudder's william's

2034
04:03:22,240 --> 04:03:27,920
syndrome oh prudder willie syndrome that sounds like um I was mixing them up yes prions diseases

2035
04:03:27,920 --> 04:03:35,600
are horrifying um did you know about the family of blue people from generations of I know there's

2036
04:03:35,600 --> 04:03:43,120
a family that's like on youtube because someone goes and films them and they um communicate via

2037
04:03:43,120 --> 04:03:47,280
barks because they have so many issues it's such a shame

2038
04:03:50,640 --> 04:03:54,480
I want this woman to yank me for the rest of my life honestly

2039
04:03:56,560 --> 04:04:03,120
uh well that speaking of prions um what is it rabid racoon bites you what's that called

2040
04:04:04,080 --> 04:04:13,520
as soon as you develop um water phobia water phobia hydrophobia water phobia once you develop

2041
04:04:13,520 --> 04:04:18,400
hydrophobia rabies that's it once you develop hydrophobia you have a hundred percent um

2042
04:04:20,000 --> 04:04:27,360
loss rate uh you can't win it is it is some scary stuff and and to think that we are very

2043
04:04:27,440 --> 04:04:33,520
lucky to avoid this by getting a simple tetanus shot um it turns out in test was not wincent

2044

2067
04:07:21,520 --> 04:07:27,040
for free by liking their streams and hanging out even if you're lurking it's perfectly fine

2091
04:10:19,280 --> 04:10:21,760
oh I heard that that plot

2092
04:10:24,400 --> 04:10:29,680
Babylon is the whole horror Babylon thing uh I've been playing too much I

2093
04:10:32,880 --> 04:10:38,720
oh my gosh right that's it oh I like that

2094
04:10:42,480 --> 04:10:48,480
okay she can beat him up it's fine I like that he's just dodging and then I just do one big

2095
04:10:48,480 --> 04:10:55,760
oh that's a steal oh no wait a minute that's against the law I'm a good fantasy role player

2096
04:10:56,320 --> 04:11:04,240
I broke her stance you know what else I'll break her hi man okay you're done where is it

2097
04:11:04,240 --> 04:11:10,400
where's the enemy oh he's uh oh I never even saw that man I really do need my glasses on that's

2098
04:11:10,400 --> 04:11:17,440
terrible legit I thought you were talking about Skyrim's Azura Azura isn't even in the other Skyrim

2099
04:11:18,000 --> 04:11:21,040
didn't have Azura maybe Azura's star

2100
04:11:22,960 --> 04:11:24,080
the kind of thing which is

2101
04:11:30,800 --> 04:11:31,600
wait is this not it

2102
04:11:33,840 --> 04:11:38,720
hey wait what how come crazy is this not it

2103
04:11:38,720 --> 04:11:54,560
oh my god I've gone way too far ahead of the plot I've gone way too far ahead of the plot

2104
04:11:54,560 --> 04:12:01,120
I've not even spoken to the guy to get him to move I was so confused why the trap door wasn't open up

2105
04:12:01,840 --> 04:12:07,520
oh Azura gets you to clean out her star right you're done I'm not not you're done

2106
04:12:08,560 --> 04:12:13,520
didn't even get to the the first message I read in chat after like a couple of minutes of combat

2107
04:12:13,520 --> 04:12:22,880
that's terrible yeah Azura's star is I thought it was on I'm literally speed run the plot I've

2108
04:12:22,880 --> 04:12:30,080
gone like 10 leagues ahead I do apologize Babel is where humanity teamed up to build a tower

2109
04:12:31,200 --> 04:12:41,040
to heaven and knocked it down and honestly it's quite interesting how

2110
04:12:43,280 --> 04:12:48,400
no I can't say that unfortunately um base I'm speed running the plot

2111
04:12:48,960 --> 04:12:57,360
uh yeah I've been playing too much Binding of Isaac oh my god wait have I said I'm I'm like

2112
04:12:57,360 --> 04:13:03,280
nine-name percent sure I've actually already said this but some of the girls are into tarot cards

2113
04:13:03,280 --> 04:13:10,560
they're called um and it's the funniest thing ever and the reason why it's funny is my only

2114
04:13:10,560 --> 04:13:16,560
exposure to tarot cards is the Binding of Isaac okay which means whenever they're talking about

2115
04:13:17,040 --> 04:13:23,200
pooling cards or whatever they're like the tower card and I'm like yes yes six bombs six bombs you

2116
04:13:23,200 --> 04:13:29,040
can probably unlock like a secret um like a tinted rock and get like a soul heart from it yes and

2117
04:13:29,040 --> 04:13:33,760
like the lovers yes you can get two hearts if you can find a donation machine maybe you can get some

2118
04:13:33,760 --> 04:13:39,440
coins out of it I'm like oh goodness sake like all of them must be rolling their eyes that my only

2119
04:13:39,440 --> 04:13:48,000
experience like the friggin the hanged man uh oh yeah um that's fantastic I can uh I can fly in the

2120
04:13:48,000 --> 04:13:54,960
room like or the full card oh yeah it takes me back to the starting of the the map oh that's amazing

2121
04:13:54,960 --> 04:14:00,080
that's amazing uh hey I'm just gonna skip this part because I don't really need to see it um

2122
04:14:02,480 --> 04:14:06,880
can you speak a little bit about your plans for membership no bother you shoot before

2123
04:14:06,880 --> 04:14:12,720
but you're honestly worth it oh my god stop you're gonna make me blush um I will most likely do two

2124
04:14:12,720 --> 04:14:20,480
memberships uh streams a week um most likely ASMR membership is probably the most requested I also

2125
04:14:20,480 --> 04:14:29,280
like doing watch alongs um some stream snap games maybe for more closed things um

2126
04:14:37,440 --> 04:14:42,640
well oh if you can speak okay it looks like only bribery works on him um

2127
04:14:44,000 --> 04:14:50,080
two I mean yeah I want to make it worth your money like the way I try to think of it in my head

2128
04:14:50,080 --> 04:14:57,680
is how much do you pay for like a movie ticket for like one and a half hours entertainment

2129
04:14:57,680 --> 04:15:04,080
okay I'ma take that and then double it and then double it again so I'm like okay I'll try to stream

2130
04:15:04,160 --> 04:15:10,800
every single day I'll also try to offer membership streams at least twice a week that seems fair

2131
04:15:10,800 --> 04:15:15,920
that means in total for the membership not only do you directly support me and future projects

2132
04:15:15,920 --> 04:15:22,160
gentle and the projects the girls want to pursue soon but we can't talk about any of it yet um

2133
04:15:24,240 --> 04:15:32,000
and it means like also get like a more I suppose like a more intimate stream experience of people

2134
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:39,040
like that um like 17 dollars for a movie ticket that's outrageous um

2135
04:15:40,480 --> 04:15:45,600
gen two confirmed live on the stream stocks I remember the first time I did this quest I was

2136
04:15:45,600 --> 04:15:50,800
so nervous about like all the guards coming at me but they don't even care hanged man

2137
04:15:51,360 --> 04:15:58,080
to we we can go well you do watch together streams for members I absolutely would love to do that

2138
04:15:58,080 --> 04:16:04,320
yes we can a hundred percent do that gen two spoiled live no clickbait oh you just wait until

2139
04:16:04,320 --> 04:16:12,800
there's don't a thumb for that if you want to see one of the concepts but not all

2140
04:16:15,600 --> 04:16:20,640
I don't really talk about it in the server with the girls out of respect because of a

2141
04:16:21,520 --> 04:16:26,640
a miscommunication on my part and honestly it's kind of easier it's much easier to go

2142
04:16:27,440 --> 04:16:32,160
you know oh shit my bad you're right then to like explain in mass detail like what the most

2143
04:16:32,160 --> 04:16:39,200
communication was you know like it is what it is gen two is just she be with a different voice

2144
04:16:39,200 --> 04:16:47,920
in a real color mm-hmm I'm actually getting her take this a charcoal skin at some point

2145
04:16:47,920 --> 04:16:52,960
I'm probably do it within the next one I brought in the coin and what not at all we're just skipping

2146
04:16:53,040 --> 04:17:00,160
through the dialogue that can I be our skin into this look now since our transaction I love

2147
04:17:00,160 --> 04:17:09,200
the gen two memes but gen one 3d though mm-hmm the girls are all very interested in 3d the problem is

2148
04:17:09,200 --> 04:17:20,000
I don't know I don't have a heart no sure what can I do for you no

2149
04:17:23,920 --> 04:17:29,600
you should think about staying the night oh wait I know one of those songs but she

2150
04:17:29,600 --> 04:17:35,120
doesn't sing it it's Roderick Roderick there's nothing like a good song to lift the spirit sure

2151
04:17:35,680 --> 04:17:43,360
what can I do for you no there once was a hero named ragnar the rest who came riding to white

2152
04:17:43,360 --> 04:17:53,760
run from old Roderick then all this ragged and ragged and brandish his blade as he told the

2153
04:17:53,760 --> 04:18:06,560
vault stories and gold that he made oh I can't remember the rest I need the rest of it it's in

2154
04:18:06,560 --> 04:18:14,080
another in I said another in she doesn't she doesn't go here right we're just gonna if you

2155
04:18:14,080 --> 04:18:18,560
want to skip this quest literally just time sink and he will teleport because it's just such a

2156
04:18:19,760 --> 04:18:24,240
whatever way you go about it you know the 3d will be lit yeah I don't have a clue like

2157
04:18:24,240 --> 04:18:31,600
they baby had like such a gorgeous 3d model but I'm like 9 in percent sure that shitting vr chat

2158
04:18:32,000 --> 04:18:39,760
um but I don't know what it is and I'm not sure any of the girls have 3d experience either to

2159
04:18:39,760 --> 04:18:45,760
help me out the best I can do is like 3d vr chat but I don't know if that's disappointing for them

2160
04:18:46,720 --> 04:18:56,560
um well maybe ask sin sin is vr chat I asked her and I was quite happy with her model like

2161
04:18:56,720 --> 04:19:03,920
um and I think that's like what the girls are if they're one 3d like that's all of God you know

2162
04:19:06,320 --> 04:19:09,760
um I'll be a learning experience for all vr chat streams being created with you know

2163
04:19:09,760 --> 04:19:17,680
could you imagine aces dg sessions in for your chat yeah it's it's not necessarily a lot of work

2164
04:19:17,680 --> 04:19:25,040
because I just oh you can't wait in this location damn game forces you east empire company warehouse

2165
04:19:25,760 --> 04:19:30,400
I wonder if that was by the British Empire British um

2166
04:19:33,120 --> 04:19:36,960
so this level you're supposed to like alert from this guy but

2167
04:19:38,960 --> 04:19:51,120
uh yeah I need to offer the girls um what are they called all the trackers but I myself don't

2168
04:19:51,120 --> 04:19:56,000
actually know what trackers they need and I don't know what the full price point is like I've

2169
04:19:56,000 --> 04:20:01,280
been really open and honest with the girls and been like obviously once everyone's monetized we

2170
04:20:01,280 --> 04:20:06,160
can see what kind of money you're earning and if it's good it's bad like because obviously if the

2171
04:20:06,160 --> 04:20:12,480
girls money's low they're not going to want to stick around are they um so I do have some kind of like

2172
04:20:12,640 --> 04:20:18,720
um mildly boosting efforts but it's not really

2173
04:20:20,720 --> 04:20:27,200
yeah you know it's kind of when you're on the managing side it's kind of like I can only

2174
04:20:27,200 --> 04:20:31,840
do so much with what the girls give me very thankfully the girls are giving me they're all

2175
04:20:31,840 --> 04:20:36,160
like literally everyone streamed every single day which was insane within reason of course

2176
04:20:36,720 --> 04:20:41,760
um and like they're taking it a bit more easy this week which I'm very glad to see we do

2177
04:20:43,280 --> 04:20:49,040
almost I'm a sneak increase yeah or do you think he notices me at all yeah no

2178
04:20:50,800 --> 04:20:58,080
uh there are some really nice uh things you can do in VR chat I have seen something I didn't

2179
04:20:58,080 --> 04:21:05,280
what detected me oh oh no he's discovering all the dead bodies along the way but he

2180
04:21:05,280 --> 04:21:07,440
doesn't find that suspicious like at all

2181
04:21:10,960 --> 04:21:16,480
I don't know if my my poor heart can take stronti in 3d it would be so fun because you can see how

2182
04:21:16,480 --> 04:21:23,840
like animated I um I thought about doing a dance 3d stream where like I play music

2183
04:21:23,840 --> 04:21:28,320
that you guys suggest and like we just dance and drink and stuff I don't know is that weird

2184
04:21:35,600 --> 04:21:45,440
um just a body nothing so so legit oh well it mustn't be anything um I thought that would

2185
04:21:45,440 --> 04:21:50,160
be cute like rating your songs and stuff but I don't know how good the tracking is like because I

2186
04:21:50,160 --> 04:21:58,320
want I want to see my butt jiggle I won't be twerking and stuff I know the year is transparent

2187
04:21:58,320 --> 04:22:02,080
and it's really endearing how come I draw to making sure everyone eats good both the talents and

2188
04:22:02,080 --> 04:22:11,200
fun it's right here in my favorite I just uh is he gonna just check to me I mean clearly he just

2189
04:22:11,200 --> 04:22:23,840
doesn't care if someone go oh um 3d stronti hypnotizes you that'll be interesting like I just don't

2190
04:22:23,840 --> 04:22:30,080
know how 3d works at all I think vain or like sony notes are the default for most tracking I've seen

2191
04:22:30,080 --> 04:22:36,560
VR avatars of pendulum and spiral tall everyone just the exception stronti

2192
04:22:43,040 --> 04:22:47,760
okay so he does a little uh jabate where he actually comes walking back which is why I'm

2193
04:22:47,760 --> 04:22:56,720
hanging back right now because he's a wee liar um but yeah 3d definitely on the cards we're just

2194
04:22:57,680 --> 04:23:04,800
obviously we're kind of in the recoup funds stage um and kind of seeing where everyone is of

2195
04:23:04,800 --> 04:23:08,880
everyone happy like I sent the girls all a message I was like is there anything I can do to make your

2196
04:23:08,880 --> 04:23:13,280
experience better like how do you feel after your first week and I got like a lot of good feedback so

2197
04:23:14,560 --> 04:23:21,200
um I'm just gonna be getting ready to get the girls shorts more consistently

2198
04:23:22,160 --> 04:23:28,880
because it's taking me a hot second to get shorts out I was hoping to at least get them

2199
04:23:28,880 --> 04:23:34,160
like two a week out right now it's like a one-wing oops and that's just because I suck

2200
04:23:36,080 --> 04:23:40,960
and I'm gonna fall in the water stronti but don't jiggle jiggle it falls

2201
04:23:43,040 --> 04:23:48,160
my money don't jiggle jiggle it falls I like to see you wiggle wiggle for sure

2202
04:23:48,880 --> 04:23:55,680
by the way when our membership expected to become available on tomorrow's stream um

2203
04:23:56,320 --> 04:24:04,160
I'm gonna get it all set up um and all of that so tomorrow's stream isn't gonna be Skyrim

2204
04:24:04,720 --> 04:24:08,160
we're not gonna do full achievements because I don't know why my achievements aren't working

2205
04:24:10,240 --> 04:24:12,720
there are enemies all over here but you can just go swinging

2206
04:24:13,040 --> 04:24:16,960
you picked a bad time to get lost I think if

2207
04:24:21,040 --> 04:24:27,440
this is no there is a health potion stacked over there somewhere I remember correctly

2208
04:24:30,560 --> 04:24:37,040
oh I thought there was a health potion here I guess no it's just Wayne close enough

2209
04:24:37,920 --> 04:24:42,720
we can sell these potion restraints so there's just spiders in there I don't know if there's

2210
04:24:42,720 --> 04:24:48,960
anything else you can just go willy nilly through this it's not really um no magic I hate magic

2211
04:24:50,400 --> 04:24:55,280
I don't want to go I can literally hear that spider in that cave it's membership gonna stream

2212
04:24:55,280 --> 04:25:00,800
yeah it's tomorrow so the the Skyrim part two is getting steam rolled over to make way for the

2213
04:25:00,800 --> 04:25:07,680
monetization stream and then I'm like 100% sure you guys know exactly what I'm doing tomorrow

2214
04:25:07,680 --> 04:25:17,200
it's not even gonna be a surprise at this point um but just yeah this is just gonna be a one

2215
04:25:17,200 --> 04:25:23,440
off Skyrim because if the achievements were working then yeah but I don't know why they're not so we

2216
04:25:23,440 --> 04:25:30,880
might actually do calming a bit earlier than expected she be as live again yes she be cotton boom

2217
04:25:30,880 --> 04:25:45,760
any any cotton boom um oh my god oh he's armored up who's next archer oh

2218
04:25:45,760 --> 04:25:57,680
I have no idea I'm just stupid to figure out are you wait do you know do you guys wait just

2219
04:25:57,680 --> 04:26:03,520
take a guess at what you think my monetization stream tomorrow is take a guess and I'll see if

2220
04:26:03,520 --> 04:26:11,760
you guys know I'll tell you if you got it right or not right where's the guy he should be here

2221
04:26:12,480 --> 04:26:13,040
oh there is

2222
04:26:15,280 --> 04:26:21,360
right yeah feet yeah okay feet stream it's feet ASMR I'm gonna have the camera

2223
04:26:22,560 --> 04:26:27,680
on my feet and because I have decks there in my toes I'm literally gonna hold the ASMR

2224
04:26:27,760 --> 04:26:37,200
tools with my toes and do like ASMR feet stream that's me yeah feet yeah I like to

2225
04:26:37,200 --> 04:26:46,640
it's ridiculous I know yeah I know it's ridiculous but I thought it was funny as anything and

2226
04:26:46,640 --> 04:26:53,360
because my model has like french tip toes I thought like yeah it's perfect I don't think my other

2227
04:26:53,440 --> 04:26:58,400
toes are gonna heal in time for it though unfortunately it's pretty mangled I don't

2228
04:26:59,600 --> 04:27:03,600
I don't think I have to go to the doctor I think I have to go to the doctor if it starts getting

2229
04:27:03,600 --> 04:27:10,960
inflamed you needed to know more now tell you what consider me your new friend in the north

2230
04:27:10,960 --> 04:27:15,920
I'm keeping the deed any objections consider it again Carlisle didn't even want it why did

2231
04:27:16,000 --> 04:27:22,880
card like a purchase golden thing now that I know who she maven if if I was maven okay

2232
04:27:22,880 --> 04:27:28,720
blah blah blah blah blah wait I must have spent a lot of time and resources would be

2233
04:27:31,680 --> 04:27:38,080
demonetized I mean can you get demonetized it's literally just fee like uh if you kind of take

2234
04:27:38,080 --> 04:27:44,160
away the ha ha funny from it it's literally just a body part and ASMR and like me is that dog

2235
04:27:44,400 --> 04:27:46,480
what um I heard that

2236
04:27:49,520 --> 04:27:54,640
okay gods could you get any more perfect that's the only concept I came up for like my monetization

2237
04:27:54,640 --> 04:28:03,360
celebration um people walk on their feet all the time yeah like I just think it's more like funny

2238
04:28:03,360 --> 04:28:09,120
ha ha than it is like anything else but like I this time so I don't keep repeating it but I

2239
04:28:09,120 --> 04:28:14,240
genuinely like feel so feminine now that I've got like my little manicure pedicure like I felt

2240
04:28:14,240 --> 04:28:20,000
so pampered like I was completely uncomfortable with the entire situation but I did feel really

2241
04:28:20,000 --> 04:28:26,480
pampered and I was like oh this is actually kind of nice hold on a minute hold on a minute these

2242
04:28:26,480 --> 04:28:33,200
gender norms have hands god damn it not again I've fallen for another one it's too difficult

2243
04:28:33,920 --> 04:28:39,840
it's too difficult I can't resist I thought I could can you really not jump this oh fine

2244
04:28:41,280 --> 04:28:46,000
you are very feminine literally like apparently my hands are super small as well like oh

2245
04:28:47,200 --> 04:28:49,040
these gender norms have hands

2246
04:28:50,640 --> 04:28:58,240
foot rubs though I will admit the foot rub that felt like heavenly oh my god like my like brain

2247
04:28:58,240 --> 04:29:03,600
was like a wire and funny I was like hold on this is like super relaxing I can't believe it all the

2248
04:29:03,600 --> 04:29:10,000
freaking stereotypes about whamming like in foot rubs are true it's awful I felt I felt so good

2249
04:29:10,000 --> 04:29:16,400
though I was like damn I need a need a reflin right now I need a need a sacrificial a sacrificial

2250
04:29:16,400 --> 04:29:22,160
reef one right now oh can I do that at the convention if we do a convention oh my god I'm

2251
04:29:22,160 --> 04:29:25,760
literally going through all the Skyrim right now just to get to the other side of the map

2252
04:29:26,320 --> 04:29:32,720
is strong he's a girl I can't believe it I'm more impressed with her dexterity how much dexterity

2256
04:29:55,440 --> 04:29:59,600
let yous do that the reason why the women could do it is because I had to put my feet in like this

2257
04:29:59,600 --> 04:30:04,960
little water bath so she had no clue that she was dealing with the sweaty feet in the west

2258
04:30:07,040 --> 04:30:12,000
so we're now learning that Carlaya is this evil evil trying to take down the thieves guild so we're

gonna meet and mercer free or sorry mercer free and I if you want the correct english are going to

2263
04:30:38,480 --> 04:30:45,600
volunteer and to be sacrificial refund my poor refunds what have I done he is honestly uh no

2264
04:30:45,680 --> 04:30:48,000
way this is like the closest landmark

2265
04:30:51,200 --> 04:30:55,360
it's gonna be a bit of a wonk I feel like I'm still level one why do I refuse to level up

2266
04:30:56,480 --> 04:30:57,360
level up

2267
04:30:59,760 --> 04:31:05,440
it doesn't matter what you're sitting on we cry because it's not us right there's someone on I

2268
04:31:05,440 --> 04:31:10,560
don't know if you guys like you swear too much but there's someone on twitter literally called like

2269
04:31:10,560 --> 04:31:15,920
mummy's chair and a freaking hee-haw every time I see them I'm like that name's hilarious like

2270
04:31:15,920 --> 04:31:21,840
your guys's names on runescape were hilarious as well um but it's actually so funny

2271
04:31:25,040 --> 04:31:30,880
just travel to white rune stable and buy a carry oh you are actually so correct however we might

2272
04:31:30,880 --> 04:31:40,000
meet Cicero on the road so there is a chance I have faith let's run that guy literally we

2273
04:31:40,000 --> 04:31:48,560

2275
04:31:57,440 --> 04:32:01,840
didn't know the kaji have a a really bad habit with skimmer

2276
04:32:02,560 --> 04:32:08,320
you found him I knew I recognized I was like is that the liar

2277
04:32:09,440 --> 04:32:14,560
of course he's a skimmer literally got nothing on his persons but three skimmer he is set for life

2278
04:32:16,960 --> 04:32:19,280
oh my god we flings we have reform

2279
04:32:20,960 --> 04:32:28,640
look at that chicken butt chicken butt chicken butt what oh Lydia no way she dances with me

2280
04:32:28,720 --> 04:32:31,760

2283
04:32:51,520 --> 04:32:58,080
chicken head covers just like that's amazing oh my god I would absolutely love to do a stream

2284
04:32:58,080 --> 04:33:04,720
about the domestication of animals as well think of how many endless animal species we have

2285
04:33:04,720 --> 04:33:11,680
and there's only I think 11 domesticated species isn't that amazing although there was one russian

2286
04:33:11,680 --> 04:33:16,880
guy who tried to domesticate foxes and he actually got really far but it does take years and years

2287
04:33:18,800 --> 04:33:21,520
you can hypnotize a chicken by drawing the line and dirt in front of them

2288
04:33:22,320 --> 04:33:27,680
oh oh oh I was a little moaned to head there please email them thank you

2289
04:33:29,280 --> 04:33:30,960
uh there's a little shack down here

2290
04:33:35,280 --> 04:33:42,400
domesticated foxes would be adorable they would oh there's a bear in this shack I recognize this

2291
04:33:42,400 --> 04:33:51,200
place from many I totally I've never heard a wolf how old like that before but

2292
04:33:51,600 --> 04:33:56,080
Lydia can you deal with them so I don't have to slow down I'm trying to make it to the

2293
04:33:57,280 --> 04:34:04,240
uh location there is probably bandits here actually that's one thing I do have to complain

2294
04:34:04,240 --> 04:34:11,200
about Skyrim there's like bandits in every freaking place ever literally I've not even approached

2295
04:34:11,200 --> 04:34:17,120
this landmark and it's like yeah bandits by the way it's like bro I didn't even get a freaking chance

2296
04:34:17,200 --> 04:34:22,080
to breathe there's always a bear foxes are difficult the worst part is they pee on everything

2297
04:34:23,200 --> 04:34:31,840
fox girl gen two confirmed made it into pee allure confirmed right there's a stable over here so

2298
04:34:31,840 --> 04:34:43,680
we're gonna head for it what's the difference between taming and domesticating taming is temp

2299
04:34:43,680 --> 04:34:48,320
horary friendship whereas domestication anyone can take over with it I think

2300
04:34:49,040 --> 04:34:59,440
because you can tame a wild hedgehog but you can't domesticate it yeah no that kind of sounds like

2301
04:34:59,440 --> 04:35:04,720
I'm on the right tracks but I did just I don't actually know the real can you please discover

2302
04:35:04,720 --> 04:35:14,960
that thank you just sweet time peeler my beloved peeler confirmed by stroney fox girl for peeler

2303
04:35:14,960 --> 04:35:23,840
lmao let the only reason they're in is because of the the content the girls like to put up

2304
04:35:25,520 --> 04:35:30,320
domestication is an extremely long process of taming yes I would agree with that statement

2305
04:35:30,960 --> 04:35:35,040
well they put fast travel on so they had to compensate for people who'd fast travel instead

2306
04:35:35,040 --> 04:35:40,400
of walk and they need more bandits oh bro every time you want to walk like two centimeters the

2307
04:35:40,400 --> 04:35:45,840
game's like enemy enemy enemy enemy taming is when you train a wild animal to be friendly around

2308
04:35:45,840 --> 04:35:50,880
humans domestications when you breed an animal over multiple generations to benefit a human yes

2309
04:35:50,880 --> 04:36:01,440
so a lot of people don't know that sheep um infinitely grow will that's because of human

2310
04:36:01,440 --> 04:36:07,120
selective breeding that they produce so much will and they've now required to be shaved

2311
04:36:07,120 --> 04:36:11,840
like you ever hear those stories that make the news that's like this sheep evaded the farmer for

2312
04:36:11,840 --> 04:36:19,200
five years and he has five years of like mats on him and the only reason that's actually even mildly

2313
04:36:19,200 --> 04:36:24,960
possible is because he was bred that way he was bred to produce like copious amounts of wool

2314
04:36:25,760 --> 04:36:31,200
and and it's like the same for horses you know how horses need little clippy cloppy horses

2315
04:36:31,200 --> 04:36:37,680
the reason for that is because of selective breeding and and the horse in the wild will

2316
04:36:37,680 --> 04:36:46,400
naturally wear down its rocks its hooves on rocks and stuff like that and what is going on here who's

2317
04:36:46,960 --> 04:36:49,520
our key um

2318
04:36:51,840 --> 04:36:58,400
like yeah silkworms we use for silk can't survive in the wild yeah i would really love to do a

2319
04:36:58,400 --> 04:37:07,120
domestication thing um i'd love to do a history one i just saw that on a perforx that wolf garden

2320
04:37:08,720 --> 04:37:13,760
huh i don't think i've ever seen a sheep on the news yeah when you come from scotland sometimes

2321
04:37:13,760 --> 04:37:21,840
the news is rather bland um you know not a lot going on in scotland if you watch the scottish news

2322
04:37:21,840 --> 04:37:32,400
oh no he didn't mate why why does the horse who's horse is that hello i'm sorry i'm late

2323
04:37:32,960 --> 04:37:40,320
good we're finally hydration check i've scouted the ruins and i'm certain carliah is still inside

2324
04:37:40,480 --> 04:37:44,080
you saw her no i found her horse

2325
04:37:45,280 --> 04:37:52,320
don't take care of it that horse didn't need to perish let's get moving i want to catch her

2326
04:37:52,320 --> 04:37:58,880
inside while she's distracted take the lead you want me to lead understood just make certain

2327
04:37:58,880 --> 04:38:05,360
you keep your eyes open carliah is selectively breeding wiflings to four you can't say that

2328
04:38:05,360 --> 04:38:14,160
that's hilarious you can't say that oh my god that's so true what the fuck that's so funny i'm

2329
04:38:14,160 --> 04:38:27,840
sorry i can't even laugh at that that's so funny um i'd rather the news be bland than hyperpolarizing

2330
04:38:27,840 --> 04:38:34,240
oh i don't even consume the news anymore where where are you bro i can hear your armor what are you

2331
04:38:34,960 --> 04:38:40,880
okay there you are jeez is everyone because she's growing so much will have actually become a

2332
04:38:40,880 --> 04:38:45,440
deficient sheep farmers don't make any money from willson synthetic fibers if a police will

2333
04:38:46,160 --> 04:38:56,560
we have to go back we need to go back please please no more plastic i'd like same i hate watching

2334
04:38:56,560 --> 04:39:04,640
yeah like it's just unwatchable it just you you'll finish a news broadcast um and you're just like

2335
04:39:04,640 --> 04:39:10,240
wow i hate life and it was like don't if if you consume things that like genuinely make you

2336
04:39:10,240 --> 04:39:16,080
more upset at the end of them it's it can be quite addictive and comforting to like watch it in the

2337
04:39:16,080 --> 04:39:22,880
moment but when you realize it's bad for you like you can just kind of posthump on it you know come

2338
04:39:22,880 --> 04:39:29,040
back another time uh there are droggers up ahead but it's not anything we can't

2339
04:39:34,880 --> 04:39:41,200
uh the droggers i'm actually gonna loot them the reason because a lot of droggers drop um

2340
04:39:41,200 --> 04:39:45,760
um soul gems which i'm needing a heck of a lot more of

2341
04:39:48,960 --> 04:39:53,440
i said they drop soul gems

2342
04:39:56,640 --> 04:40:07,040
soul gems se oh ah oh gems i can see that but i don't mean whoa okay sorry i'm sorry please

2343
04:40:07,040 --> 04:40:10,800
forgive me for pill in the lever i didn't mean i promise i won't do it again we all

2344
04:40:15,440 --> 04:40:18,160
okay they're just dropping gems i couldn't freaking

2345
04:40:20,960 --> 04:40:23,040
uh i didn't even get a chance to wiggle it

2346
04:40:27,200 --> 04:40:29,200
no no

2347
04:40:29,600 --> 04:40:31,600

sorry i was looking at the corner of my eye oh ah

2350
04:40:48,800 --> 04:40:55,280
i can so ends the lesson uh doggers don't usually have soul gems wait who do i think

2351
04:40:55,280 --> 04:41:02,480
have soul gems on them oh the the centaurians have um the the good golden guys no

2352
04:41:06,400 --> 04:41:14,400
i'm like going left side i'm like okay there we go so many soul gems okay they just have gold

2353
04:41:14,480 --> 04:41:16,400
on them apparently we

2354
04:41:19,680 --> 04:41:25,360
get it your feeble attempts he's like so

2355
04:41:29,280 --> 04:41:35,280
nope don't ask me how long it took me to find the opening to this so my first playthrough

2356
04:41:35,280 --> 04:41:44,160
it's so painful this was my first ever um skyrim game actually my dad played morrow and um

2357
04:41:45,360 --> 04:41:50,800
but my my favorite thing about morrowind is that you can just jump on the spot um

2358
04:41:52,960 --> 04:41:55,520
and then like you level up your stamina it's quite interesting

2359
04:41:58,320 --> 04:42:03,520
oh i can do this you mean elder school's game yeah wait what did i say my first skyrim game

2360
04:42:04,240 --> 04:42:07,520
sad oh my dumb dumb

2361
04:42:11,040 --> 04:42:18,400
and he i was gonna say it's even oh no not me right now ryan hey stroney i wanted to ask you

2362
04:42:18,400 --> 04:42:23,440
something yeah i know you can speak scott but i was curious to know if you knew gaelic as well

2363
04:42:23,440 --> 04:42:28,560
cause if i remember correctly there's not that many people left in scotland that can speak it

2364
04:42:28,560 --> 04:42:33,680
no they don't teach us that uh if you come from the mainland you don't learn gaelic at all

2365
04:42:34,240 --> 04:42:41,200
um it's basically a dying language because they refuse to teach it to the next generation

2366
04:42:41,920 --> 04:42:47,760
i don't know if it's gonna change i hope it'll change in the future but sadly no i do not speak

2367
04:42:47,760 --> 04:42:54,800
gaelic which is just how it is they do not teach it and oh pretty shit

2368
04:42:55,040 --> 04:43:04,640
um but thank you for the tip narrow yes uh very sadly the they don't teach it uh if you're from

2369
04:43:04,640 --> 04:43:10,400
the mainland of scotland and i am from the mainland of scotland if you didn't know lovely little uh

2370
04:43:10,400 --> 04:43:22,560
scot wait no did i mean to do that i don't think i meant to do that did i um if i didn't come from

2371
04:43:22,560 --> 04:43:28,080
the mainland and i came from the shetland for example which is at the north some it's okay

2372
04:43:28,080 --> 04:43:33,680
if you don't really know scotland that well um where the heck is this red on the map that i get

2373
04:43:34,320 --> 04:43:35,280
am i going the right way

2374
04:43:38,240 --> 04:43:41,520
yel skeever okay i'm going the right way i don't know how to do that

2375
04:43:42,640 --> 04:43:46,640
that's so sad gaelic is one of the very few Celtic languages out left yeah like um

2376
04:43:47,200 --> 04:43:51,200
uh something's here scotland and ireland and all that were like pagan

2377
04:43:51,840 --> 04:43:58,560
fucking hell this is a lot of enemies got enemies got a lot of enemies i'm just swanging

2378
04:44:00,240 --> 04:44:06,720
i'm just swinging around my new ones business honestly me if i was a guy i'd be elephant and

2379
04:44:06,720 --> 04:44:10,960
that stuff up

2380
04:44:15,280 --> 04:44:20,240
i'm 42 i'm leveling up faster than my fishing and runescape

2381
04:44:22,000 --> 04:44:26,560
although you still need a trans a translator for glass region yes the scots is the

2382
04:44:27,280 --> 04:44:34,800
he just like went flying uh you really wanted that um

2383
04:44:37,200 --> 04:44:42,880
there's poison darts if i remember correctly yeah i'm just too good i just remember everything

2384
04:44:42,880 --> 04:44:51,360
honestly um yes i am very lucky that i do have scots at least which is recognized as its own

2385
04:44:51,360 --> 04:44:57,680
language which is really cool and i know it sounds like i'm like speaking that's because

2386
04:44:57,680 --> 04:45:04,480
i don't use slang at all like at all um oh we're almost there uh we're almost there

2387
04:45:08,160 --> 04:45:08,480
um

2388
04:45:12,560 --> 04:45:17,760
uh i'm completely forgotten what was happening about i hate these guys because they can yeah

2389
04:45:17,760 --> 04:45:26,000
they can disarm you which i don't like wait he he has special

2390
04:45:29,200 --> 04:45:37,200
eh i've never seen this before this is not freaking xbox certified flawed barla stone

2391
04:45:37,200 --> 04:45:47,120
what the heck is that why why did why did pc yell these cool things what the heck is a wireless stone

2392
04:45:48,240 --> 04:45:55,360
can you do a fool on scottish dream uh i mean if you mean slang i can only really do it for

2393
04:45:55,360 --> 04:46:02,400
like a couple of minutes because it's just like i get more mumbly and like oh good morning good

2394
04:46:02,400 --> 04:46:08,640
evening good afternoon and all that who's it going like it just doesn't really sound that good and

2395
04:46:08,640 --> 04:46:15,120
i don't think it's that relaxing either like and i kind of hate to put it on because my mom was like

2396
04:46:15,120 --> 04:46:21,840
no then he speaks slang in the house so i didn't and then obviously being an online creator

2397
04:46:22,560 --> 04:46:26,720
it's the complete opposite everyone wants to hear you with a slang in every hand and it's like oh

2398
04:46:26,720 --> 04:46:33,520
right then i guess it's a bit uh it's a bit forced because i was discouraged from speaking

2399
04:46:33,520 --> 04:46:42,000
words these doors have a weakness pc got updates xbox charges per update plus pc got lots of content

2400
04:46:42,960 --> 04:46:45,360
xbox charges per update i don't know

2401
04:46:48,960 --> 04:46:52,720
it's just a bit pointless learning gaelic when english is so common yeah like oh

2402
04:46:54,640 --> 04:47:01,040
i ain't looking good i ain't looking good i'm gonna take a nap right here

2403
04:47:01,040 --> 04:47:08,800
can you talk dirty scott's if you want

2404
04:47:11,520 --> 04:47:17,120
and a member stream sure yeah i remember liby saying some scott's can't pronounce for yeah

2405
04:47:18,080 --> 04:47:23,680
so if i say how i normally annunciate purple burglar alarm like i can't do it but if i put on

2406
04:47:23,680 --> 04:47:30,160
a harsh accent my tongue gets caught at the back of my mouth like a purple burglar alarm

gallas had his wealth and he had you all he had to do was look the other way

04:47:52,240 --> 04:47:57,760

2503
04:59:00,480 --> 04:59:05,680
three made um because they were they it was like cheap and it was like i might as well lost them

2504
04:59:05,680 --> 04:59:11,200
out because i already know what i'm gonna call them i'm just gonna discover this location i don't

2505
04:59:11,200 --> 04:59:15,600
know if we're gonna start going against the force one shortly there are another type of bandits

2506
04:59:15,600 --> 04:59:25,040
essentially uh right how do i get around i guess i get around oh no robbs corpses look

2507
04:59:25,760 --> 04:59:29,760
they're not gonna need it let's be honest they're not gonna need that those nine coins

2508
04:59:29,760 --> 04:59:34,640
gen three spoiled no there's absolutely nothing planned of gen three i don't even know what concepts

2509
04:59:34,640 --> 04:59:41,680
i want and stroney did you see what you want yes what i want i submit what i want and then i

2510
04:59:41,680 --> 04:59:44,560
get back something and then i keep going to the drawing board that's how it works

2511
04:59:47,120 --> 04:59:58,480
so you're at my mercy shoulda picked mercy you can't purchase in the afterlife gen six

2512
04:59:59,040 --> 05:00:07,920
absolutely no i am done birthing any children after gen three i mean it's also like uh there's a

2513
05:00:07,920 --> 05:00:14,320
whole other thing to it there's actually a whole other trust factor as well like gen one i completely

2514
05:00:14,320 --> 05:00:19,200
trust wholeheartedly um like i did my thorough research on the girls and like when i when i

2515
05:00:19,200 --> 05:00:25,920
did the interview like i never got any bad vibes or whatever um which sounds terrible like oh you

2516
05:00:25,920 --> 05:00:30,960
did an interview like an informal interview and went off of was there bad vibes or not and the

2517
05:00:30,960 --> 05:00:38,960
answer is yeah i did actually um because and when you hear people talk you can get a sense of like

2518
05:00:38,960 --> 05:00:45,280
especially when they expect it like a super um like a super professional thing and you're just

2519
05:00:45,280 --> 05:00:50,640
like oh surprise it's actually just me me man uh here's here's the rules type thing um mercy's

2520
05:00:50,720 --> 05:00:54,720
patreon just went live oh she got an update i can't even remember what her update was

2521
05:00:57,040 --> 05:01:02,480
i i don't know i don't know what the tags are even though i was the one who put that up there for

2522
05:01:02,480 --> 05:01:08,080
her sounds like you got a trust you got yeah like i i get described as naive a lot which i

2523
05:01:08,080 --> 05:01:12,960
honestly don't mind i actually genuinely agree with that and kind of assessment sorry i'm just

2524
05:01:12,960 --> 05:01:18,560
trying to hit loads of markers along the way so we can just backtrack like this super easily

2525
05:01:19,520 --> 05:01:25,920
um oh is this like a little hunter's lodge thing going on oh it's like a little campsite oh

2526
05:01:30,800 --> 05:01:37,040
anyway we eating good tonight after three generations there's a real a real risk of bad

2527
05:01:37,040 --> 05:01:46,400
actors trying to get in that software yeah so because um i need to choose my words carefully

2528
05:01:47,120 --> 05:01:56,480
but i hope you can agree with um my my my thought process but it may not be reality because it's

2529
05:01:56,480 --> 05:02:06,320
just my thought process um it is very plausible that there were vtubers who were interested but

2530
05:02:06,320 --> 05:02:13,200
didn't apply because they wanted the guaranteed success of gen 2 like to see what gen 1 achieved

2531
05:02:13,200 --> 05:02:22,000
to see what gen 2 achieved because not that they didn't put their faith in the plan

2532
05:02:24,800 --> 05:02:28,560
it's not so obviously you want to you want to be a part something that's successful let's

2533
05:02:28,560 --> 05:02:36,560
wait am i on the right way or am i on the wrong way no i'm gonna write um i need to try and think

2534
05:02:36,560 --> 05:02:47,920
of my sense just like i'm really happy with gen 1 and everyone is good basically however the rate

2535
05:02:47,920 --> 05:02:55,120
as you said the rate of a bad actor coming into play does get higher um

2536
05:02:58,080 --> 05:03:03,760
but hopefully you know there's girls like with you know plenty of experience and i can just

2537
05:03:03,760 --> 05:03:11,760
see and assess them you don't want to risk the gamble yes it's like i don't know how to say that

2538
05:03:11,760 --> 05:03:17,840
i just knew all the girls i'm trying to have a really nice moment talking about my girls okay um

2539
05:03:20,000 --> 05:03:27,040
the risk does get higher when new people are introduced that may not have previous history

2540
05:03:27,040 --> 05:03:32,480
like um what the heck what am i trying to do where the heck am i trying to go

2541
05:03:34,480 --> 05:03:37,680
you can't see me um

2542
05:03:41,280 --> 05:03:43,680
i think you're doing the right thing you don't want to feel like you're even

2543
05:03:43,680 --> 05:03:50,960
messed up in the wrong thing yes that like um i did speak of someone who applied and then i went

2544
05:03:50,960 --> 05:03:56,080
on their twitch just to check them out in general and they spoke about how they only want to hang

2545
05:03:56,080 --> 05:04:03,040
around for one year and then send their audience to their old account and the quote was like because

2546
05:04:03,040 --> 05:04:11,200
the creator seems so chill or something and i got an in route um and it was just like kind of shocking

2547
05:04:12,160 --> 05:04:18,080
and it does like kind of slap me back to reality that like people who apply they might not actually

2548
05:04:18,080 --> 05:04:24,000
want to hang around and achieve like loads of goals they might just do it to go do their own thing

2549
05:04:24,960 --> 05:04:31,360
the lover stone this always feels the comforts of love all skills improve faster

2550
05:04:32,720 --> 05:04:36,560
if all skills improve faster then sure call me the lover stone

2551
05:04:38,560 --> 05:04:45,520
uh who would put that on social me out what wow you know that really happened um

2552
05:04:46,720 --> 05:04:51,920
they uh applied their application and i pretty much checked out everyone's stream

2553
05:04:52,720 --> 05:04:58,560
um uh after they applied just to see what they were putting out there because um there was a

2554
05:04:58,560 --> 05:05:05,680
very notable trend of people applying and then all of a sudden their stream uh consistency ramped up

2555
05:05:05,680 --> 05:05:10,080
because they were getting assessed and they were aware they were getting assessed uh i don't think

2556
05:05:10,080 --> 05:05:17,360
i didn't notice that if you were one of those girls um uh there was also stream variety came

2557
05:05:17,360 --> 05:05:26,400
out of nowhere some people were very glued to one type of game um and all of a sudden uh they

2558
05:05:26,400 --> 05:05:41,520
start doing a variety of games uh kind of showing that they can play a different um but yes um i did

2559
05:05:41,520 --> 05:05:49,120
get to experience someone who openly admitted that they basically applied but couldn't care less

2560
05:05:49,120 --> 05:05:56,160
about the actual longevity of violour and it is quite scary to think that there's a possibility

2561
05:05:56,960 --> 05:06:04,080
that even through my vetting process um there is a team who also assessed uh the girls that get in

2562
05:06:04,800 --> 05:06:16,160
as well um and maybe at a later date i can maybe speak a bit more about i think now is a bit too

2563
05:06:16,160 --> 05:06:25,120
sensitive of a time because obviously it's only been uh one week excuse me sorry just dealing with

2570
05:07:08,160 --> 05:07:15,040
up shit creek because everyone who applied i was not satisfied with their fit for the voice i did

2571
05:07:15,200 --> 05:07:22,240

i think i'm i might have

2637
05:15:08,000 --> 05:15:11,360
i think i went completely wrong way pardon me

2638
05:15:16,880 --> 05:15:20,240
it's barred from another site so i was going the right freaking way

2639
05:15:21,440 --> 05:15:23,200
ah right okay let's try again

2640
05:15:26,000 --> 05:15:32,800
i'm sure i can figure it out when i get there i feel like a some secret offer is it no these are

2641
05:15:33,200 --> 05:15:39,680
living quarters you're the stealthiest thief ever strong and no one will see you if they're dead

2642
05:15:39,680 --> 05:15:47,120
exactly i don't know why that's still going because i pulled a lever uh i think i did it on the other

2643
05:15:47,120 --> 05:15:54,240
side of the poison uh i guess if you wanted to be stealth you could just go through the poison

2644
05:15:54,240 --> 05:15:55,600
but we'll just go for it

2645
05:15:55,760 --> 05:16:01,280
we're going we're going we're going

2646
05:16:04,560 --> 05:16:08,800
i'm being a dome dome okay turn the off

2647
05:16:11,760 --> 05:16:15,760
right there so it's quiet and then up the stairs literally they were right there

2648
05:16:15,760 --> 05:16:20,720
and i walked away from them it's just feeling quirky okay just feeling misunderstood

2649
05:16:21,280 --> 05:16:22,720
mmm

2650
05:16:24,800 --> 05:16:30,400
just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen just let it happen it's okay

2651
05:16:31,280 --> 05:16:32,640
just let it happen

2652
05:16:37,680 --> 05:16:38,960
just let it happen

2653
05:16:42,080 --> 05:16:46,400
just let it happen it's okay it's okay just let it happen

2654
05:16:46,400 --> 05:16:51,400
Mm, big potatoes.

2655
05:16:51,400 --> 05:16:56,400
Just, oh, 20, 20, go, enchanting.

2656
05:16:56,400 --> 05:17:00,400
That's good, that'll be like enchanting up in here.

2657
05:17:00,400 --> 05:17:02,400
Just let it out.

2658
05:17:02,400 --> 05:17:05,400
Okay, we don't really need to, oh, the box, we need that.

2659
05:17:05,400 --> 05:17:10,400
Mm, is this the barred door?

2660
05:17:10,400 --> 05:17:13,400
It was!

2661
05:17:13,400 --> 05:17:16,400
Okay, we've now got the shortcut.

2662
05:17:16,400 --> 05:17:18,400
So what's this?

2663
05:17:18,400 --> 05:17:20,400
It's a chest.

2664
05:17:20,400 --> 05:17:22,400
And then what's that?

2665
05:17:22,400 --> 05:17:24,400
That's just the other side of the map.

2666
05:17:24,400 --> 05:17:25,400
Oh my god, we did it.

2667
05:17:25,400 --> 05:17:27,400
It's not war crime if it's a cute girl.

2668
05:17:27,400 --> 05:17:31,400
Me committing war crimes?

2669
05:17:31,400 --> 05:17:34,400
Stop, you're making me laugh.

2670
05:17:34,400 --> 05:17:36,400
Oh my gosh, I'm so turned around.

2671
05:17:36,400 --> 05:17:40,400
It's been so long since I've done this.

2672
05:17:40,400 --> 05:17:43,400
It's called barbarian stealth, honestly?

2673
05:17:43,400 --> 05:17:46,400
I actually really like that description for my thingy.

2674
05:17:46,400 --> 05:17:49,400
Like, I've always tried to do...

2675
05:17:49,400 --> 05:17:52,400
What the heck?

2676
05:17:52,400 --> 05:17:53,400
Jump shot.

2677
05:17:53,400 --> 05:17:55,400
Oh, right, wait, what?

2678
05:17:55,400 --> 05:17:58,400
There's a tic-tac to leave there.

2679
05:17:58,400 --> 05:18:02,400
I don't think there's any enemies until they come in.

2680
05:18:02,400 --> 05:18:05,400
We just need to pick up some charcoal and a piece of paper,

2681
05:18:05,400 --> 05:18:08,400
steal the paper, steal the charcoal.

2682
05:18:08,400 --> 05:18:12,400
It took me so long to figure out this area.

2683
05:18:12,400 --> 05:18:14,400
Heavy armor increased to 16.

2684
05:18:14,400 --> 05:18:16,400
Well, it wasn't really worth the level up.

2685
05:18:16,400 --> 05:18:17,400
But hey, we did it.

2686
05:18:17,400 --> 05:18:18,400
I'm gonna break some...

2687
05:18:18,400 --> 05:18:20,400
Break it down now.

2688
05:18:24,400 --> 05:18:25,400
Oh, look at that.

2689
05:18:25,400 --> 05:18:27,400
Look at that.

2690
05:18:27,400 --> 05:18:29,400
We do have a bow and arrow.

2691
05:18:29,400 --> 05:18:30,400
Fire damage?

2692
05:18:30,400 --> 05:18:31,400
Soul trap?

2693
05:18:31,400 --> 05:18:32,400
Maybe...

2694
05:18:32,400 --> 05:18:36,400
No, maybe not a soul trap on us.

2695
05:18:36,400 --> 05:18:38,400
I would say fire damage.

2696
05:18:38,400 --> 05:18:40,400
Take a little burn.

2697
05:18:40,400 --> 05:18:41,400
Now, what?

2698
05:18:41,400 --> 05:18:43,400
Petty or...

2699
05:18:43,400 --> 05:18:45,400
Bubbish.

2700
05:18:45,400 --> 05:18:46,400
You know, Seagrog.

2701
05:18:46,400 --> 05:18:49,400
Method of stealth, honestly.

2702
05:18:49,400 --> 05:18:52,400
Look, if it works, is there...

2703
05:18:52,400 --> 05:18:54,400
Is there truly a point?

2704
05:18:54,400 --> 05:18:55,400
Is there truly a point?

2705
05:18:55,400 --> 05:18:58,400
Right, so the enemies do come in here.

2706
05:18:58,400 --> 05:19:01,400
Obviously, because we are playing on legendary mode

2707
05:19:01,400 --> 05:19:03,400
and I'm just so MLG pro.

2708
05:19:03,400 --> 05:19:04,400
Yeah, excuse me.

2709
05:19:04,400 --> 05:19:07,400
We're just gonna one-shot them, confidently.

2710
05:19:07,400 --> 05:19:10,400
We are just going to one-shot them, confidently.

2711
05:19:10,400 --> 05:19:13,400
We are just gonna one-shot them.

2712
05:19:13,400 --> 05:19:15,400
Nice and confidently.

2713
05:19:15,400 --> 05:19:17,400
No problems.

2714
05:19:20,400 --> 05:19:23,400
CUTELY commits crimes against humanity, honestly.

2715
05:19:25,400 --> 05:19:28,400
Have you played Ghost of Toshima?

2716
05:19:28,400 --> 05:19:29,400
I haven't.

2717
05:19:29,400 --> 05:19:30,400
One-shot, 100%.

2718
05:19:30,400 --> 05:19:31,400
Return to the guy.

2719
05:19:31,400 --> 05:19:32,400
Where's the guy?

2720
05:19:32,400 --> 05:19:34,400
Is he in here?

2721
05:19:34,400 --> 05:19:37,400
Oh, return to the guy, guy.

2722
05:19:37,400 --> 05:19:40,400
Return to the guy.

2723
05:19:40,400 --> 05:19:45,400
Walk on fire.

2724
05:19:45,400 --> 05:19:49,400
Why the heck does it make me go backwards?

2725
05:19:53,400 --> 05:19:54,400
I'm just...

2726
05:19:54,400 --> 05:19:58,400
The map in is a bit rough.

2727
05:19:59,400 --> 05:20:02,400
Can I loot this?

2728
05:20:02,400 --> 05:20:04,400
I can't.

2729
05:20:04,400 --> 05:20:05,400
They're so good.

2730
05:20:05,400 --> 05:20:08,400
Wait, are the guards gonna attack me?

2731
05:20:08,400 --> 05:20:10,400
Are the marker of guards gonna attack me?

2732
05:20:10,400 --> 05:20:12,400
I think they might.

2733
05:20:13,400 --> 05:20:15,400
I come back and see you're still in...

2734
05:20:15,400 --> 05:20:17,400
Eh, no.

2735
05:20:17,400 --> 05:20:20,400
I'm sorry, but these accusations are unfounded.

2736
05:20:20,400 --> 05:20:21,400
I'm not a novice.

2737
05:20:21,400 --> 05:20:24,400
I'm on legendary, clearly.

2738
05:20:24,400 --> 05:20:26,400
Look, I'm sorry to your untrained eye,

2739
05:20:26,400 --> 05:20:28,400
but when you get really good at the game,

2740
05:20:28,400 --> 05:20:30,400
it just makes things...

2741
05:20:30,400 --> 05:20:32,400
Why did it do that?

2742
05:20:32,400 --> 05:20:34,400
Why did you do that?

2743
05:20:34,400 --> 05:20:36,400
Why does the game do that?

2744
05:20:36,400 --> 05:20:38,400
Honestly, I could fart on it something.

2745
05:20:40,400 --> 05:20:42,400
Yeah, just because I'm such a high-skilled level,

2746
05:20:42,400 --> 05:20:46,400
it makes it appear to be a very easy level.

2747
05:20:46,400 --> 05:20:49,400
So please don't worry about it.

2748
05:20:49,400 --> 05:20:51,400
No, okay.

2749
05:21:00,400 --> 05:21:02,400
I've played this game for two...

2750
05:21:02,400 --> 05:21:04,400
How dare you?

2751
05:21:04,400 --> 05:21:06,400
Why is the child in the basement?

2752
05:21:07,400 --> 05:21:09,400
Alright, here's the translation, bro.

2753
05:21:11,400 --> 05:21:13,400
I'm rubbing.

2754
05:21:15,400 --> 05:21:17,400
When you're amazing, you make everything look easy.

2755
05:21:17,400 --> 05:21:19,400
Yeah, legendary.

2756
05:21:21,400 --> 05:21:23,400
See how that's not valued at 50?

2757
05:21:23,400 --> 05:21:25,400
It's not going to teach you nothing.

2758
05:21:25,400 --> 05:21:27,400
Don't open that book.

2759
05:21:29,400 --> 05:21:32,400
Maybe sometime you should judge a book by cover.

2760
05:21:37,400 --> 05:21:40,400
Mercer Frey is the baddie.

2761
05:21:41,400 --> 05:21:43,400
Dun-dun-dun!

2762
05:21:46,400 --> 05:21:48,400
He's trying to once you rub him.

2763
05:21:50,400 --> 05:21:52,400
That's actually my specialty.

2764
05:22:06,400 --> 05:22:08,400
The Nightingales!

2765
05:22:10,400 --> 05:22:13,400
It seems to describe the failure of the Nightingales,

2766
05:22:13,400 --> 05:22:16,400
although it doesn't go into great detail.

2767
05:22:16,400 --> 05:22:18,400
Gallus also repeatedly mentions

2768
05:22:18,400 --> 05:22:20,400
his strong belief that Mercer desecrated

2769
05:22:20,400 --> 05:22:23,400
something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.

2770
05:22:27,400 --> 05:22:30,400
She bawled under that hood.

2771
05:22:31,400 --> 05:22:33,400
Baw headed in.

2772
05:22:36,400 --> 05:22:38,400
The annoying hint is actually the bad guy.

2773
05:22:38,400 --> 05:22:40,400
I'm shocked, colouring me surprised.

2774
05:22:42,400 --> 05:22:45,400
Golden writing standards by the dev team.

2775
05:22:47,400 --> 05:22:48,400
Bald!

2776
05:22:48,400 --> 05:22:50,400
It always annoyed me when you put on a hood,

2777
05:22:50,400 --> 05:22:53,400
your hair gets removed

2778
05:22:53,400 --> 05:22:55,400
and annoys me so much.

2779
05:22:57,400 --> 05:22:59,400
It's just such a...

2780
05:23:01,400 --> 05:23:03,400
Excuse you, anyone talking to you?

2781
05:23:03,400 --> 05:23:07,400
Listen, all I want is the truth to be revealed to the guild.

2782
05:23:07,400 --> 05:23:10,400
They respected Carlaya and she deserves better.

2783
05:23:10,400 --> 05:23:13,400
Do whatever you can and I'd consider it a personal favour.

2784
05:23:13,400 --> 05:23:15,400
Sure, thank you.

2785
05:23:15,400 --> 05:23:17,400
If you ever manage to gain entry to the college

2786
05:23:17,400 --> 05:23:20,400
and you find trying to rid yourself of stolen goods...

2787
05:23:20,400 --> 05:23:22,400
He's a fan!

2788
05:23:22,400 --> 05:23:25,400
I've been known to handle items of questionable interest

2789
05:23:25,400 --> 05:23:27,400
from time to time.

2790
05:23:27,400 --> 05:23:29,400
Questionable interest, I like that.

2791
05:23:29,400 --> 05:23:31,400
We must hasten to rift in before Mercer can do any more...

2792
05:23:31,400 --> 05:23:33,400
We must hasten to rift in!

2793
05:23:38,400 --> 05:23:40,400
Bald gent who member confirmed...

2794
05:23:40,400 --> 05:23:42,400
No! No!

2795
05:23:42,400 --> 05:23:44,400
Say it ain't so.

2796
05:23:44,400 --> 05:23:46,400
I will not go.

2797
05:23:46,400 --> 05:23:47,400
Turn the lights off.

2798
05:23:47,400 --> 05:23:49,400
Carry me home.

2799
05:23:52,400 --> 05:23:54,400
Oh my god, members carry okay.

2800
05:23:54,400 --> 05:23:56,400
I can absolutely wreck my voice on that.

2801
05:23:57,400 --> 05:23:59,400
I can get beer.

2802
05:23:59,400 --> 05:24:01,400
I can get beer!

2803
05:24:01,400 --> 05:24:04,400
And we can do membership karaoke.

2804
05:24:05,400 --> 05:24:07,400
And I can do song requests.

2805
05:24:07,400 --> 05:24:09,400
You guys put it together.

2806
05:24:09,400 --> 05:24:11,400
I'll be pretty good.

2807
05:24:26,400 --> 05:24:28,400
I'll drink till you spew.

2808
05:24:36,400 --> 05:24:40,400
Carla currently and kindly explaining the Nightingale lore

2809
05:24:40,400 --> 05:24:42,400
and her relationship to Gallus

2810
05:24:42,400 --> 05:24:45,400
whilst I sing that one beer parody song

2811
05:24:45,400 --> 05:24:48,400
that had that Lego animation.

2812
05:24:48,400 --> 05:24:50,400
Why are you in the basement child?

2813
05:24:50,400 --> 05:24:53,400
I'm getting weirded out.

2814
05:24:53,400 --> 05:24:55,400
Leave me alone!

2815
05:24:55,400 --> 05:24:57,400
Get away!

2816
05:24:57,400 --> 05:24:59,400
Creepy wee thing, honestly.

2817
05:25:03,400 --> 05:25:05,400
And you sing Flare of Scotland?

2818
05:25:05,400 --> 05:25:07,400
No, I have to be hate music.

2819
05:25:07,400 --> 05:25:09,400
I'm not singing, I'm getting drunk and going

2820
05:25:09,400 --> 05:25:13,400
Oh, Flare of Scotland

2821
05:25:13,400 --> 05:25:20,400
When will we see our life again?

2822
05:25:25,400 --> 05:25:30,400
I don't know why national songs insist on going so high.

2823
05:25:30,400 --> 05:25:34,400
Can't you just give me one song

2824
05:25:34,400 --> 05:25:38,400
where the decibels, the notes in it

2825
05:25:38,400 --> 05:25:40,400
are just really common

2826
05:25:40,400 --> 05:25:42,400
and everyone can sing it.

2827
05:25:42,400 --> 05:25:45,400
Donald, where are your choosers?

2828
05:25:45,400 --> 05:25:46,400
What's that song?

2829
05:25:46,400 --> 05:25:48,400
I think I've ever heard of it.

2830
05:25:48,400 --> 05:25:50,400
I missed beer whilst I was grabbing a drink.

2831
05:25:50,400 --> 05:25:53,400
No, no, no, we're going to do drunk membership thingy.

2832
05:25:56,400 --> 05:25:58,400
Back to where I am.

2833
05:25:58,400 --> 05:26:01,400
I'll take my poops in.

2834
05:26:01,400 --> 05:26:04,400
I'm ready, let's go.

2835
05:26:04,400 --> 05:26:09,400
I was going to force us to sing Christmas carols on Christmas.

2836
05:26:09,400 --> 05:26:13,400
I like a wee and a manger.

2837
05:26:13,400 --> 05:26:17,400
A wee and a manger.

2838
05:26:17,400 --> 05:26:20,400
No crib for a pit.

2839
05:26:20,400 --> 05:26:22,400
Why does it go so high pitch?

2840
05:26:22,400 --> 05:26:24,400
Why can't they not just have a song

2841
05:26:24,400 --> 05:26:25,400
down here?

2842
05:26:25,400 --> 05:26:28,400
No crib for a bed.

2843
05:26:28,400 --> 05:26:35,400
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.

2844
05:26:35,400 --> 05:26:42,400
The cattle are lowing.

2845
05:26:42,400 --> 05:26:45,400
I was going to force you guys to do

2846
05:26:45,400 --> 05:26:47,400
freaking Christmas songs with me

2847
05:26:47,400 --> 05:26:50,400
and then we watch Lord of the Rings on Christmas.

2848
05:26:51,400 --> 05:26:54,400
Where the winds blow high,

2849
05:26:54,400 --> 05:26:56,400
where the winds blow to the streets

2850
05:26:56,400 --> 05:26:58,400
and my cattle go.

2851
05:26:58,400 --> 05:27:00,400
Although as you say hello Donald,

2852
05:27:00,400 --> 05:27:02,400
what the freak, I've never heard that.

2853
05:27:02,400 --> 05:27:04,400
Do you have titsangles?

2854
05:27:04,400 --> 05:27:06,400
Do they wobble to the floor?

2855
05:27:08,400 --> 05:27:11,400
I can't say that, I'm sorry.

2856
05:27:11,400 --> 05:27:14,400
I'm getting a bit delirious, hold on a minute.

2857
05:27:16,400 --> 05:27:18,400
You've never heard that song before.

2858
05:27:19,400 --> 05:27:25,400
Do they go to and fro?

2859
05:27:25,400 --> 05:27:27,400
She's not even drunk yet.

2860
05:27:27,400 --> 05:27:29,400
Just talking about alcohol is getting me steaming.

2861
05:27:29,400 --> 05:27:31,400
It's making me lose the plot.

2862
05:27:31,400 --> 05:27:33,400
No, it can't be.

2863
05:27:33,400 --> 05:27:35,400
No, it can't be.

2864
05:27:35,400 --> 05:27:37,400
What's that mean?

2865
05:27:37,400 --> 05:27:39,400
He quoted the main.

2866
05:27:39,400 --> 05:27:41,400
The floor?

2867
05:27:41,400 --> 05:27:43,400
Yeah, it's a bit dirty, we're currently in the sewers.

2868
05:27:45,400 --> 05:27:47,400
Do they wobble to the floor?

2869
05:27:48,400 --> 05:27:50,400
Can you tie them in the knot?

2870
05:27:50,400 --> 05:27:52,400
Can you tie them in a bow?

2871
05:27:54,400 --> 05:27:57,400
My kami oshi hates Mongolian throat singing.

2872
05:27:57,400 --> 05:28:00,400
It's because cats don't like the sound of the vibration

2873
05:28:00,400 --> 05:28:02,400
that Mongolian throat singing provides.

2874
05:28:02,400 --> 05:28:06,400
So thus I don't like it, I don't like vibrations.

2875
05:28:06,400 --> 05:28:08,400
That rrrrrrr.

2876
05:28:08,400 --> 05:28:09,400
No, bad.

2877
05:28:09,400 --> 05:28:12,400
Cats don't like it, it makes their ears go back.

2878
05:28:12,400 --> 05:28:14,400
So it makes my ears go back.

2879
05:28:15,400 --> 05:28:18,400
World's greatest thieves live in a sewer.

2880
05:28:18,400 --> 05:28:20,400
Down in the sewer.

2881
05:28:22,400 --> 05:28:25,400
Ever listen to the nasty shrank, please?

2882
05:28:28,400 --> 05:28:30,400
Let's go.

2883
05:28:30,400 --> 05:28:32,400
The memer is starting to break free.

2884
05:28:32,400 --> 05:28:35,400
I want to break free.

2885
05:28:36,400 --> 05:28:38,400
My cat likes it.

2886
05:28:38,400 --> 05:28:41,400
Your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing

2887
05:28:41,400 --> 05:28:43,400
and I will not be taking any further statements.

2888
05:28:43,400 --> 05:28:47,400
I assure you, your cat does not like Mongolian throat singing.

2889
05:28:48,400 --> 05:28:51,400
Beast cat, absolutely not.

2890
05:28:51,400 --> 05:28:53,400
Are you sure about that?

2891
05:28:53,400 --> 05:28:57,400
Rip project women OST fans and shambles due to the Mongolian throat singing.

2892
05:29:03,400 --> 05:29:05,400
I was so hard to sing that.

2893
05:29:05,400 --> 05:29:08,400
Any song is hard to sing, my voice is so frazzled.

2894
05:29:13,400 --> 05:29:18,400
Can I meet my life away?

2895
05:29:18,400 --> 05:29:21,400
Sorry, the thieves gold are now just revealing

2896
05:29:21,400 --> 05:29:23,400
that Mercer has betrayed them for many years

2897
05:29:23,400 --> 05:29:26,400
and there's not a penny left for them.

2898
05:29:26,400 --> 05:29:34,400
Meet my life away.

2899
05:29:34,400 --> 05:29:37,400
Why is Caravans a frog in the stream?

2900
05:29:37,400 --> 05:29:39,400
Caravans a frog here.

2901
05:29:39,400 --> 05:29:42,400
I would like to do some karaoke.

2902
05:29:43,400 --> 05:29:45,400
Sing your cover live.

2903
05:29:45,400 --> 05:29:48,400
He also like rock music.

2904
05:29:48,400 --> 05:29:51,400
We doubt you don't like vibrations.

2905
05:29:51,400 --> 05:29:53,400
I've got an even funner fact.

2906
05:29:55,400 --> 05:29:57,400
I only like it.

2907
05:29:57,400 --> 05:29:59,400
Before I help you track Mercer now,

2908
05:29:59,400 --> 05:30:02,400
I need to know what you learned from Carlya.

2909
05:30:02,400 --> 05:30:06,400
Mercer killed Gallus, not Carlya.

2910
05:30:06,400 --> 05:30:09,400
Gallus, Carlya and Mercer were nightingales.

2911
05:30:09,400 --> 05:30:11,400
Was there anything else she told you?

2912
05:30:11,400 --> 05:30:13,400
I was behind Golden Glow and Honeybrew.

2913
05:30:13,400 --> 05:30:15,400
Was there anything else?

2914
05:30:15,400 --> 05:30:16,400
Say it.

2915
05:30:16,400 --> 05:30:18,400
I need you to break into my...

2916
05:30:18,400 --> 05:30:21,400
The magic button cannot handle the vibration.

2917
05:30:21,400 --> 05:30:23,400
Be careful, just find a way in.

2918
05:30:23,400 --> 05:30:25,400
But the dark road home can.

2919
05:30:25,400 --> 05:30:28,400
You have permission to kill anyone that stands in your way.

2920
05:30:28,400 --> 05:30:29,400
Oh, I have permission.

2921
05:30:29,400 --> 05:30:31,400
Okay, infiltrate Mercer's home.

2922
05:30:31,400 --> 05:30:33,400
Oh, everyone's on alert.

2923
05:30:33,400 --> 05:30:36,400
Alert, alert, Mercer.

2924
05:30:36,400 --> 05:30:38,400
Alert, alert.

2925
05:30:38,400 --> 05:30:40,400
All are welcome at the Temple of Mora.

2926
05:30:40,400 --> 05:30:42,400
Ah, there we are, but you shouldn't be here.

2927
05:30:44,400 --> 05:30:46,400
I don't doubt for one second.

2928
05:30:46,400 --> 05:30:48,400
I won't remember that.

2929
05:30:48,400 --> 05:30:50,400
Please continue.

2930
05:30:50,400 --> 05:30:52,400
Information stored and saved.

2931
05:30:52,400 --> 05:30:53,400
Yee...

2932
05:30:53,400 --> 05:30:55,400
Literally...

2933
05:30:55,400 --> 05:30:57,400
There's no doubt about it.

2934
05:30:57,400 --> 05:30:59,400
The tales gilded back.

2935
05:30:59,400 --> 05:31:01,400
I didn't realize how...

2936
05:31:01,400 --> 05:31:05,400
Fake speedish that all the voice actors' accents try to mimic.

2937
05:31:05,400 --> 05:31:07,400
It's actually quite jarring.

2938
05:31:07,400 --> 05:31:09,400
Be careful.

2939
05:31:09,400 --> 05:31:11,400
What are you talking about?

2940
05:31:11,400 --> 05:31:12,400
Hello?

2941
05:31:12,400 --> 05:31:13,400
Hello?

2942
05:31:13,400 --> 05:31:16,400
This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors.

2943
05:31:16,400 --> 05:31:17,400
Now go away.

2944
05:31:17,400 --> 05:31:19,400
I need to get inside Mercer's house, please.

2945
05:31:19,400 --> 05:31:21,400
No visitors, no way.

2946
05:31:21,400 --> 05:31:23,400
Now piss off before you make me mad.

2947
05:31:24,400 --> 05:31:27,400
I'll make it worth your while.

2948
05:31:27,400 --> 05:31:30,400
You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away.

2949
05:31:30,400 --> 05:31:33,400
Unless you can talk to Maven Blackbriar and to let me out of my debt.

2950
05:31:33,400 --> 05:31:34,400
Okay.

2951
05:31:34,400 --> 05:31:37,400
You try and set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.

2952
05:31:37,400 --> 05:31:38,400
Fine.

2953
05:31:38,400 --> 05:31:40,400
I'll go talk to Maven about big...

2954
05:31:40,400 --> 05:31:42,400
Big...

2955
05:31:42,400 --> 05:31:43,400
Big stinky...

2956
05:31:43,400 --> 05:31:44,400
What's your name?

2957
05:31:44,400 --> 05:31:45,400
Bald?

2958
05:31:45,400 --> 05:31:46,400
More like...

2959
05:31:49,400 --> 05:31:50,400
Cold.

2960
05:31:50,400 --> 05:31:53,400
Because it's freezing outside and you're not wearing any outfit.

2961
05:31:53,400 --> 05:31:54,400
Oh!

2962
05:31:54,400 --> 05:31:56,400
Absolutely rolled and decked.

2963
05:31:56,400 --> 05:31:57,400
Hello?

2964
05:31:57,400 --> 05:31:59,400
America, hiya.

2965
05:32:00,400 --> 05:32:01,400
No, no, no.

2966
05:32:01,400 --> 05:32:02,400
American?

2967
05:32:03,400 --> 05:32:05,400
When's Azura's birthday?

2968
05:32:05,400 --> 05:32:08,400
I believe it's the 23rd of August if I'm not mistaken.

2969
05:32:15,400 --> 05:32:16,400
Is she not up?

2970
05:32:16,400 --> 05:32:17,400
Where is she?

2971
05:32:21,400 --> 05:32:22,400
He less of a shite.

2972
05:32:22,400 --> 05:32:24,400
Where's Maria?

2973
05:32:24,400 --> 05:32:25,400
Big Maria.

2974
05:32:27,400 --> 05:32:28,400
Okay, hold on.

2975
05:32:28,400 --> 05:32:30,400
If I put that on, it should show me where she is.

2976
05:32:30,400 --> 05:32:31,400
Oh, she is here.

2977
05:32:31,400 --> 05:32:33,400
You were there all along.

2978
05:32:43,400 --> 05:32:46,400
Sam, if you don't want any of it, I'll take a bell for you.

2979
05:32:47,400 --> 05:32:48,400
What did he do?

2980
05:32:53,400 --> 05:32:55,400
Do you think Mercer...

2981
05:32:55,400 --> 05:32:56,400
Is a cl-

2982
05:32:56,400 --> 05:32:57,400
What?

2983
05:33:00,400 --> 05:33:02,400
He's in debt because of a quill?

2984
05:33:14,400 --> 05:33:17,400
Is this his quill that's in the freaking lake?

2985
05:33:18,400 --> 05:33:20,400
I believe it.

2986
05:33:25,400 --> 05:33:26,400
Oh, no.

2987
05:33:28,400 --> 05:33:31,400
I think it might just be easier to perish this man.

2988
05:33:33,400 --> 05:33:35,400
I think it's in a boat.

2989
05:33:35,400 --> 05:33:38,400
Oh, goodness me, it's been many a year.

2990
05:33:38,400 --> 05:33:40,400
I think it's in a boat.

2991
05:33:40,400 --> 05:33:42,400
I'm gonna have to look at it on the HUD.

2992
05:33:42,400 --> 05:33:43,400
Hold on.

2993
05:33:43,400 --> 05:33:49,400
I want to say it's like somewhere here to the left.

2994
05:33:51,400 --> 05:33:55,400
Oh, I could be terribly wrong though, but there should be a boat.

2995
05:33:56,400 --> 05:33:57,400
It started.

2996
05:34:08,400 --> 05:34:10,400
It's at the bottom of the lake somewhere.

2997
05:34:10,400 --> 05:34:11,400
Thank you for your help.

2998
05:34:11,400 --> 05:34:13,400
I really appreciate that.

2999
05:34:13,400 --> 05:34:16,400
I am somewhere at the bottom of the lake.

3000
05:34:16,400 --> 05:34:18,400
I don't even have water breathing either.

3001
05:34:18,400 --> 05:34:19,400
I can't believe you.

3002
05:34:19,400 --> 05:34:21,400
You had the audacity to take that out.

3003
05:34:21,400 --> 05:34:23,400
You're just trying to upset me.

3004
05:34:23,400 --> 05:34:25,400
What's this?

3005
05:34:25,400 --> 05:34:27,400
What's that barnacles?

3006
05:34:34,400 --> 05:34:35,400
Wait, wait, wait.

3007
05:34:35,400 --> 05:34:36,400
Is this a hint?

3008
05:34:36,400 --> 05:34:37,400
Hold on, let me breathe.

3009
05:34:37,400 --> 05:34:40,400
Is this a hint that maybe you're around here somewhere?

3010
05:34:42,400 --> 05:34:43,400
Hold on.

3011
05:34:43,400 --> 05:34:44,400
Right, should we?

3012
05:34:44,400 --> 05:34:45,400
Oh, no.

3013
05:34:45,400 --> 05:34:48,400
Right, well, there was a box, but I guess not.

3014
05:34:48,400 --> 05:34:49,400
There's rocks here.

3015
05:34:49,400 --> 05:34:52,400
Is that telling me it's here somewhere?

3016
05:34:52,400 --> 05:34:54,400
But the barnacles, there's more barnacles.

3017
05:34:54,400 --> 05:34:57,400
Oh, can you say render distance, please?

3018
05:34:57,400 --> 05:34:58,400
Stronius, under the water.

3019
05:34:58,400 --> 05:35:00,400
You don't want reflins.

3020
05:35:02,400 --> 05:35:04,400
Ah, let me breathe.

3021
05:35:05,400 --> 05:35:07,400
I seem to think it's like the left side.

3022
05:35:07,400 --> 05:35:09,400
I saw that storage box.

3023
05:35:09,400 --> 05:35:11,400
I think that's the game being like hint.

3024
05:35:11,400 --> 05:35:12,400
It's over here.

3025
05:35:14,400 --> 05:35:15,400
Okay, hold on.

3026
05:35:15,400 --> 05:35:17,400
Let me just check again.

3027
05:35:17,400 --> 05:35:20,400
I think it's in a broken boat.

3028
05:35:20,400 --> 05:35:23,400
Um, it's on the map somewhere.

3029
05:35:23,400 --> 05:35:25,400
Right, I'm not reading chat for the next minute.

3030
05:35:25,400 --> 05:35:27,400
You're on time out.

3031
05:35:27,400 --> 05:35:29,400
You're done.

3032
05:35:29,400 --> 05:35:32,400
I seem to think it's close to the edge of the water.

3033
05:35:32,400 --> 05:35:34,400
Wait, this is a bit too close, clearly.

3034
05:35:34,400 --> 05:35:35,400
By the bridge?

3035
05:35:35,400 --> 05:35:38,400
I don't recall it being by a bridge, to be honest.

3036
05:35:42,400 --> 05:35:44,400
You know what, reflin?

3037
05:35:44,400 --> 05:35:45,400
What?

3038
05:35:47,400 --> 05:35:48,400
A strong name.

3039
05:35:48,400 --> 05:35:50,400
What do you think of the Indiana Jones game?

3040
05:35:50,400 --> 05:35:52,400
I didn't know there was a new one.

3041
05:35:54,400 --> 05:35:55,400
Oh, for goodness' sake.

3042
05:35:55,400 --> 05:35:57,400
I think I'm off the mark.

3043
05:35:57,400 --> 05:35:58,400
Where am I?

3044
05:35:59,400 --> 05:36:03,400
Maybe it's like down here a bit.

3045
05:36:03,400 --> 05:36:05,400
This is the entire area.

3046
05:36:05,400 --> 05:36:08,400
Okay, I'm just going to do one big loop around the island.

3047
05:36:08,400 --> 05:36:10,400
Why is there so many salmon?

3048
05:36:10,400 --> 05:36:12,400
Shoney, I love you.

3049
05:36:12,400 --> 05:36:13,400
Don't hate my friends.

3050
05:36:13,400 --> 05:36:15,400
Wait, why would I hate your friends?

3051
05:36:15,400 --> 05:36:17,400
I thought you weren't looking at us.

3052
05:36:17,400 --> 05:36:19,400
Look, I forgive really easily.

3053
05:36:19,400 --> 05:36:20,400
Oh, no, get up!

3054
05:36:20,400 --> 05:36:22,400
Shabee, what are you doing?

3055
05:36:22,400 --> 05:36:24,400
Underwater burning.

3056
05:36:24,400 --> 05:36:27,400
Okay, I don't...

3057
05:36:27,400 --> 05:36:29,400
think it's up this way.

3058
05:36:29,400 --> 05:36:32,400
But we're going to just do a big circle

3059
05:36:32,400 --> 05:36:35,400
for the sake of satisfying myself.

3060
05:36:39,400 --> 05:36:42,400
Come up for water often.

3061
05:36:44,400 --> 05:36:46,400
Reflins, remember that Shoney's much of an...

3062
05:36:46,400 --> 05:36:49,400
as much of an addict as we are.

3063
05:36:50,400 --> 05:36:52,400
Scuba, Shabee.

3064
05:36:54,400 --> 05:36:56,400
Shabee, making me nervous.

3065
05:36:58,400 --> 05:36:59,400
Oh, wait.

3066
05:36:59,400 --> 05:37:00,400
Maybe I'm on one of these islands.

3067
05:37:00,400 --> 05:37:02,400
I may be rocked up on a baby island.

3068
05:37:02,400 --> 05:37:03,400
Do you know that?

3069
05:37:03,400 --> 05:37:04,400
What the heck was that?

3070
05:37:04,400 --> 05:37:05,400
I'm rabbit.

3071
05:37:07,400 --> 05:37:08,400
Hold on.

3072
05:37:08,400 --> 05:37:10,400
Let's just check the hut again.

3073
05:37:10,400 --> 05:37:12,400
We're kind of at the furthest point

3074
05:37:12,400 --> 05:37:14,400
of this section of the lake.

3075
05:37:14,400 --> 05:37:17,400
I'm not really wanting to go too much further.

3076
05:37:18,400 --> 05:37:20,400
It's near the box you found before.

3077
05:37:20,400 --> 05:37:22,400
Oh, my God, I'm actually getting my hand held.

3078
05:37:22,400 --> 05:37:23,400
See, thank you, refling.

3079
05:37:23,400 --> 05:37:24,400
I actually get my hand held.

3080
05:37:24,400 --> 05:37:26,400
And you're just freaking back there.

3081
05:37:27,400 --> 05:37:29,400
I've gone way off course.

3082
05:37:31,400 --> 05:37:33,400
Oh, my God, forgive me.

3083
05:37:33,400 --> 05:37:35,400
Fucking nonchalant.

3084
05:37:37,400 --> 05:37:40,400
It's between the big island and Riften.

3085
05:37:40,400 --> 05:37:41,400
That's it.

3086
05:37:41,400 --> 05:37:42,400
I'm giving in.

3087
05:37:42,400 --> 05:37:43,400
Skyrimmer's been installed.

3088
05:37:43,400 --> 05:37:44,400
Are you happy now?

3089
05:37:44,400 --> 05:37:46,400
Oh, have I put you in the Skyrim mid?

3090
05:37:46,400 --> 05:37:47,400
Yippee!

3091
05:37:48,400 --> 05:37:49,400
I can't help the sarcasm.

3092
05:37:49,400 --> 05:37:50,400
I forget where the thing is every time.

3093
05:37:50,400 --> 05:37:52,400
In waste half an hour looking also.

3094
05:37:52,400 --> 05:37:54,400
It's underwater, not on an island.

3095
05:37:55,400 --> 05:37:57,400
Yeah, it's like crashed off of it.

3096
05:37:58,400 --> 05:38:00,400
My eyes are currently burning,

3097
05:38:00,400 --> 05:38:02,400
opening under the salt water.

3098
05:38:04,400 --> 05:38:05,400
Right.

3099
05:38:06,400 --> 05:38:07,400
That's not it.

3100
05:38:07,400 --> 05:38:09,400
These are just textures.

3101
05:38:10,400 --> 05:38:11,400
It's not like this.

3102
05:38:11,400 --> 05:38:13,400
I can't even swim in.

3103
05:38:14,400 --> 05:38:16,400
So there's no point.

3104
05:38:17,400 --> 05:38:19,400
I'm gonna go buy that box again.

3105
05:38:19,400 --> 05:38:21,400
If I could find the box again.

3106
05:38:23,400 --> 05:38:25,400
We'll float to the right this time,

3107
05:38:25,400 --> 05:38:28,400
not to be confused with the hit TV game.

3108
05:38:28,400 --> 05:38:29,400
A little to the left.

3109
05:38:29,400 --> 05:38:31,400
I don't know why I said TV game.

3110
05:38:32,400 --> 05:38:33,400
Steam game.

3111
05:38:37,400 --> 05:38:39,400
So those are the barnacles.

3112
05:38:42,400 --> 05:38:43,400
I'm getting swept up.

3113
05:38:44,400 --> 05:38:46,400
We're trying to find the quill.

3114
05:38:47,400 --> 05:38:48,400
That maven.

3115
05:38:50,400 --> 05:38:53,400
I did not realise how rubbish this game is.

3116
05:38:54,400 --> 05:38:55,400
Is this for real?

3117
05:38:55,400 --> 05:38:58,400
There's like two floating foxes under the cave.

3118
05:38:59,400 --> 05:39:00,400
What's going on here?

3119
05:39:02,400 --> 05:39:04,400
I can see loads of broken stuff.

3120
05:39:05,400 --> 05:39:07,400
Hold on, let me breathe again.

3121
05:39:10,400 --> 05:39:11,400
Right.

3122
05:39:12,400 --> 05:39:14,400
Definitely not searchable.

3123
05:39:15,400 --> 05:39:19,400
There's loads of boxes just hanging off the dock.

3124
05:39:22,400 --> 05:39:23,400
It just works.

3125
05:39:23,400 --> 05:39:26,400
I think you may have floated over it.

3126
05:39:26,400 --> 05:39:28,400
It's not by the docks.

3127
05:39:30,400 --> 05:39:32,400
I like the detail though,

3128
05:39:32,400 --> 05:39:34,400
the concept that it fell off the boat

3129
05:39:34,400 --> 05:39:36,400
and they can't retrieve it.

3130
05:39:36,400 --> 05:39:37,400
That's quite smart.

3131
05:39:45,400 --> 05:39:47,400
This is where I'm on the map.

3132
05:39:48,400 --> 05:39:50,400
I'm like messing around here.

3133
05:39:52,400 --> 05:39:54,400
Isn't this rock formation maybe?

3134
05:39:56,400 --> 05:39:57,400
What the barnacles?

3135
05:39:58,400 --> 05:40:00,400
Hold on, let me breathe.

3136
05:40:00,400 --> 05:40:03,400
I'm like right, I'm like freaking, I'm here.

3137
05:40:03,400 --> 05:40:05,400
I doubt it got dropped here.

3138
05:40:05,400 --> 05:40:07,400
It just seems so unlikely.

3139
05:40:07,400 --> 05:40:10,400
Go straight from the docks towards the island.

3140
05:40:12,400 --> 05:40:13,400
Okay.

3141
05:40:15,400 --> 05:40:16,400
Hmm.

3142
05:40:22,400 --> 05:40:24,400
I'm searching, I'm searching.

3143
05:40:24,400 --> 05:40:26,400
There's salmon, there's salmon,

3144
05:40:26,400 --> 05:40:28,400
there's bulks, there's bulks,

3145
05:40:28,400 --> 05:40:31,400
but it's more towards here.

3146
05:40:33,400 --> 05:40:35,400
Don't need to breathe, hold on.

3147
05:40:37,400 --> 05:40:38,400
Okay.

3148
05:40:41,400 --> 05:40:42,400
Okay, this is new.

3149
05:40:42,400 --> 05:40:44,400
I don't think I've investigated this.

3150
05:40:45,400 --> 05:40:46,400
Maybe we have.

3151
05:40:50,400 --> 05:40:52,400
They have a freaking potion of water breathing

3152
05:40:52,400 --> 05:40:54,400
that would make this a lot either.

3153
05:40:56,400 --> 05:40:57,400
Water breathing where?

3154
05:40:57,400 --> 05:40:59,400
Water breathing.

3155
05:40:59,400 --> 05:41:01,400
Oh, a whole 15 seconds.

3156
05:41:01,400 --> 05:41:03,400
Oh, you're too kind, you're too kind.

3157
05:41:07,400 --> 05:41:08,400
Oh!

3158
05:41:08,400 --> 05:41:10,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3159
05:41:10,400 --> 05:41:13,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, fucking.

3160
05:41:17,400 --> 05:41:19,400
Oh, oh, oh, I'm getting current.

3161
05:41:19,400 --> 05:41:21,400
I'm getting drafted away by the current.

3162
05:41:21,400 --> 05:41:23,400
Okay, fuck that.

3163
05:41:23,400 --> 05:41:24,400
Alright, I was doing the new one.

3164
05:41:24,400 --> 05:41:26,400
Stop, current, stop, I can't breathe.

3165
05:41:31,400 --> 05:41:32,400
Oh.

3166
05:41:40,400 --> 05:41:41,400
Ah!

3167
05:41:41,400 --> 05:41:44,400
I've only got 10 lock picks.

3168
05:41:44,400 --> 05:41:45,400
Going to be easy on me.

3169
05:41:45,400 --> 05:41:47,400
I'm going to need to bow some more.

3170
05:41:48,400 --> 05:41:49,400
No!

3171
05:41:50,400 --> 05:41:51,400
Less?

3172
05:41:54,400 --> 05:41:55,400
I'm like...

3173
05:41:58,400 --> 05:42:00,400
Is that less or is that more?

3174
05:42:03,400 --> 05:42:04,400
Oh.

3175
05:42:05,400 --> 05:42:06,400
Give me that.

3176
05:42:06,400 --> 05:42:08,400
Stupid bastard.

3177
05:42:08,400 --> 05:42:09,400
Bastard, you're a quill.

3178
05:42:09,400 --> 05:42:10,400
Right.

3179
05:42:10,400 --> 05:42:11,400
We did it.

3180
05:42:11,400 --> 05:42:12,400
Oh my god, that took well.

3181
05:42:14,400 --> 05:42:17,400
Just get Vol-song and forget about that.

3182
05:42:17,400 --> 05:42:19,400
What's Vol-song?

3183
05:42:20,400 --> 05:42:21,400
She's got it.

3184
05:42:21,400 --> 05:42:23,400
If she can open the box, literally.

3185
05:42:23,400 --> 05:42:24,400
What's inside the box?

3186
05:42:24,400 --> 05:42:26,400
That's a freaking quill.

3187
05:42:27,400 --> 05:42:28,400
You did it.

3188
05:42:28,400 --> 05:42:30,400
You're the first person in history to buy lock picks.

3189
05:42:30,400 --> 05:42:31,400
They're so common.

3190
05:42:31,400 --> 05:42:33,400
I know, I keep forgetting to feel like glue.

3191
05:42:33,400 --> 05:42:34,400
Hi, do you want a quill?

3192
05:42:34,400 --> 05:42:37,400
I presume you're bothering me for a good reason.

3193
05:42:37,400 --> 05:42:38,400
I've found the quill.

3194
05:42:38,400 --> 05:42:39,400
Really?

3195
05:42:39,400 --> 05:42:41,400
I wrote that off a long time ago.

3196
05:42:41,400 --> 05:42:45,400
Well, I suppose I need to fulfill my end of the bargain.

3197
05:42:45,400 --> 05:42:46,400
Yes.

3198
05:42:46,400 --> 05:42:47,400
Give this document to Vol.

3199
05:42:47,400 --> 05:42:48,400
It frees him from the debt.

3200
05:42:48,400 --> 05:42:50,400
But I never want to see him in Rifton again.

3201
05:42:50,400 --> 05:42:51,400
Oh, okay.

3202
05:42:51,400 --> 05:42:52,400
Oh, that's Exile.

3203
05:42:52,400 --> 05:42:53,400
That's not very nice.

3204
05:42:53,400 --> 05:42:55,400
He's made his pals here.

3205
05:42:55,400 --> 05:42:57,400
Do you want to reconsider Exile on someone?

3206
05:42:57,400 --> 05:42:59,400
That's not very nice.

3207
05:42:59,400 --> 05:43:00,400
Have you heard of that?

3208
05:43:00,400 --> 05:43:03,400
Have you heard how damaging that can be to someone's social life?

3209
05:43:04,400 --> 05:43:06,400
Makes him feel like they're not a part of the community.

3210
05:43:06,400 --> 05:43:08,400
You have to, you know, uproot and go elsewhere.

3211
05:43:08,400 --> 05:43:09,400
Not nice.

3212
05:43:09,400 --> 05:43:10,400
He's trying to suck it at Skyrim.

3213
05:43:10,400 --> 05:43:11,400
I know.

3214
05:43:13,400 --> 05:43:15,400
You, come here.

3215
05:43:15,400 --> 05:43:17,400
I can't talk to him yet or he'll be aggressive.

3216
05:43:17,400 --> 05:43:19,400
Like, you.

3217
05:43:23,400 --> 05:43:25,400
Here, over here.

3218
05:43:25,400 --> 05:43:26,400
What?

3219
05:43:26,400 --> 05:43:27,400
What?

3220
05:43:28,400 --> 05:43:29,400
Or Big Vault.

3221
05:43:29,400 --> 05:43:30,400
Sorry, Big Vault.

3222
05:43:30,400 --> 05:43:31,400
Oh, oh, he's going to that gate.

3223
05:43:31,400 --> 05:43:32,400
Hold on.

3224
05:43:32,400 --> 05:43:34,400
If we're fast enough, if we're fast enough, we can go.

3225
05:43:34,400 --> 05:43:37,400
We can go talk to him on the other side of that gate.

3226
05:43:37,400 --> 05:43:38,400
Vault.

3227
05:43:38,400 --> 05:43:39,400
Vault, hold on.

3228
05:43:39,400 --> 05:43:40,400
Vault.

3229
05:43:40,400 --> 05:43:41,400
Vault, it's me.

3230
05:43:41,400 --> 05:43:42,400
It's me.

3231
05:43:42,400 --> 05:43:43,400
No, no, no.

3232
05:43:43,400 --> 05:43:44,400
He's come back to the original position.

3233
05:43:44,400 --> 05:43:46,400
No, Vault, no.

3234
05:43:46,400 --> 05:43:47,400
Wait, Vault, wait.

3235
05:43:47,400 --> 05:43:48,400
Let me talk to you.

3236
05:43:48,400 --> 05:43:49,400
I just want to talk to you.

3237
05:43:49,400 --> 05:43:50,400
I just want to talk to you.

3238
05:43:50,400 --> 05:43:51,400
I just want to talk to you.

3239
05:43:51,400 --> 05:43:52,400
I just want to talk to you.

3240
05:43:52,400 --> 05:43:53,400
I just want to talk to you.

3241
05:43:53,400 --> 05:43:54,400
Vault.

3242
05:43:54,400 --> 05:43:55,400
Vault.

3243
05:43:55,400 --> 05:43:56,400
Oh.

3244
05:43:56,400 --> 05:43:57,400
I have something for you.

3245
05:43:58,400 --> 05:44:00,400
Here, it's your debt with Maven.

3246
05:44:00,400 --> 05:44:01,400
You're free.

3247
05:44:13,400 --> 05:44:14,400
What are you doing?

3248
05:44:14,400 --> 05:44:15,400
How's he added?

3249
05:44:15,400 --> 05:44:17,400
Are you just coming out now?

3250
05:44:17,400 --> 05:44:19,400
Oh, he is.

3251
05:44:19,400 --> 05:44:20,400
Oh.

3252
05:44:22,400 --> 05:44:23,400
Okay, thank you.

3253
05:44:23,400 --> 05:44:25,400
Thank you very much.

3254
05:44:25,400 --> 05:44:27,400
Can I just come in this way?

3255
05:44:27,400 --> 05:44:28,400
Oh, it's barred.

3256
05:44:28,400 --> 05:44:29,400
Wait.

3257
05:44:29,400 --> 05:44:31,400
I need a bow and arrow.

3258
05:44:31,400 --> 05:44:33,400
Or can I just hit this?

3259
05:44:35,400 --> 05:44:36,400
Okay.

3260
05:44:36,400 --> 05:44:38,400
No, you need a bow and arrow.

3261
05:44:38,400 --> 05:44:40,400
I was being a bit...

3262
05:44:40,400 --> 05:44:42,400
Let me just...

3263
05:44:46,400 --> 05:44:47,400
Tada.

3264
05:44:48,400 --> 05:44:50,400
That's how you get the ramp down.

3265
05:44:50,400 --> 05:44:51,400
Super fuss.

3266
05:44:51,400 --> 05:44:53,400
He's skipping town, no reason.

3267
05:44:56,400 --> 05:44:57,400
Hmm.

3268
05:44:59,400 --> 05:45:02,400
I just subbed to all the girls account.

3269
05:45:02,400 --> 05:45:03,400
Heck, you did.

3270
05:45:03,400 --> 05:45:06,400
We love supporting genmates out here.

3271
05:45:09,400 --> 05:45:12,400
Oh, Delinia, you animal.

3272
05:45:12,400 --> 05:45:14,400
Literally finishing off the kill.

3273
05:45:14,400 --> 05:45:17,400
She said, nah, I want to be the reason

3274
05:45:17,400 --> 05:45:20,400
for death on the death certificate.

3275
05:45:20,400 --> 05:45:22,400
Jeez, Louise girl.

3276
05:45:23,400 --> 05:45:26,400
The bar is locked in place and cannot be opened.

3277
05:45:26,400 --> 05:45:27,400
Okay.

3278
05:45:27,400 --> 05:45:29,400
Uh, any money?

3279
05:45:29,400 --> 05:45:31,400
Garnet, I'll take you.

3280
05:45:31,400 --> 05:45:33,400
I can sell it for...

3281
05:45:33,400 --> 05:45:34,400
some money.

3282
05:45:34,400 --> 05:45:36,400
Statue of Debala, how about that?

3283
05:45:36,400 --> 05:45:37,400
Can I move that one?

3284
05:45:37,400 --> 05:45:38,400
Nope, can't move that one either.

3285
05:45:38,400 --> 05:45:40,400
Okay, um, I'll just stop touching things

3286
05:45:40,400 --> 05:45:42,400
in this house then, I guess.

3287
05:45:42,400 --> 05:45:44,400
I guess I'll go F myself.

3288
05:45:44,400 --> 05:45:45,400
Wait.

3289
05:45:45,400 --> 05:45:46,400
What?

3290
05:45:46,400 --> 05:45:48,400
This isn't the end.

3291
05:45:48,400 --> 05:45:49,400
Hold on.

3292
05:45:53,400 --> 05:45:55,400
Right here?

3293
05:45:55,400 --> 05:45:57,400
Ah, um, yeah.

3294
05:45:57,400 --> 05:45:59,400
Wait, I'm not touching anything else.

3295
05:45:59,400 --> 05:46:02,400
Suspicious clothes.

3296
05:46:02,400 --> 05:46:04,400
Honestly, I wouldn't have figured that out more.

3297
05:46:04,400 --> 05:46:06,400
Ah, if the game didn't help.

3298
05:46:06,400 --> 05:46:08,400
Little cheeky alien potion.

3299
05:46:08,400 --> 05:46:09,400
Oh.

3300
05:46:09,400 --> 05:46:11,400
Oh, what's this?

3301
05:46:11,400 --> 05:46:13,400
Oh, I have no idea what this is.

3302
05:46:13,400 --> 05:46:14,400
That looks like a trap.

3303
05:46:14,400 --> 05:46:17,400
Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, stop standing on stuff, Lydia.

3304
05:46:17,400 --> 05:46:19,400
Lydia, Lydia.

3305
05:46:20,400 --> 05:46:22,400
Oh, I'm getting sliced in days.

3306
05:46:22,400 --> 05:46:23,400
Hold on.

3307
05:46:23,400 --> 05:46:24,400
Oh.

3308
05:46:24,400 --> 05:46:28,400
I'm getting absolutely chopped up.

3309
05:46:28,400 --> 05:46:30,400
Oh, and there's poison darts.

3310
05:46:30,400 --> 05:46:31,400
Mine.

3311
05:46:31,400 --> 05:46:32,400
Goodness.

3312
05:46:32,400 --> 05:46:34,400
You need to relax.

3313
05:46:34,400 --> 05:46:35,400
Oh, my God.

3314
05:46:35,400 --> 05:46:36,400
Mine.

3315
05:46:37,400 --> 05:46:38,400
Okay, I've got that.

3316
05:46:38,400 --> 05:46:39,400
What's this?

3317
05:46:39,400 --> 05:46:40,400
Eh.

3318
05:46:41,400 --> 05:46:43,400
What even?

3319
05:46:43,400 --> 05:46:44,400
Why is this book?

3320
05:46:44,400 --> 05:46:45,400
I have curiosity.

3321
05:46:45,400 --> 05:46:47,400
What's the contents of this book?

3322
05:46:47,400 --> 05:46:49,400
I've never actually read it.

3323
05:46:53,400 --> 05:46:55,400
Lift her tail.

3324
05:46:55,400 --> 05:46:56,400
Certainly not, kind sir.

3325
05:46:56,400 --> 05:46:58,400
I am here to clean your chambers.

3326
05:46:58,400 --> 05:47:00,400
Is that all you have come...

3327
05:47:00,400 --> 05:47:02,400
Is that all you have come here for?

3328
05:47:02,400 --> 05:47:04,400
Little one, my chambers.

3329
05:47:04,400 --> 05:47:06,400
I have no idea what is you, implying master.

3330
05:47:06,400 --> 05:47:08,400
I am but a poor Argonian maid.

3331
05:47:08,400 --> 05:47:09,400
Bro, what?

3332
05:47:09,400 --> 05:47:11,400
So you are my dumpling.

3333
05:47:11,400 --> 05:47:12,400
And a good one at that.

3334
05:47:12,400 --> 05:47:14,400
Such strong legs and shapely tail.

3335
05:47:14,400 --> 05:47:15,400
You embarrass me, sir.

3336
05:47:15,400 --> 05:47:17,400
Fear not, you are safe with me.

3337
05:47:17,400 --> 05:47:19,400
I must finish my cleaning, sir.

3338
05:47:19,400 --> 05:47:21,400
The mistress will have my head if I do not.

3339
05:47:21,400 --> 05:47:22,400
Cleaning, eh?

3340
05:47:22,400 --> 05:47:24,400
I have something for you right here.

3341
05:47:24,400 --> 05:47:27,400
Polish my spear.

3342
05:47:27,400 --> 05:47:28,400
But it is huge.

3343
05:47:28,400 --> 05:47:30,400
It could take me all night.

3344
05:47:30,400 --> 05:47:31,400
Plenty of time.

3345
05:47:31,400 --> 05:47:33,400
My sweet plenty.

3346
05:47:34,400 --> 05:47:37,400
I've never fricking read that.

3347
05:47:38,400 --> 05:47:39,400
Oh, my God.

3348
05:47:39,400 --> 05:47:41,400
That's hilarious.

3349
05:47:42,400 --> 05:47:43,400
Many thanks.

3350
05:47:43,400 --> 05:47:47,400
Not certain how you managed to get your hands on this item we discussed,

3351
05:47:47,400 --> 05:47:48,400
but I'm more than pleased.

3352
05:47:48,400 --> 05:47:52,400
I thought you'd simply wait until transported to Castle Devorah

3353
05:47:52,400 --> 05:47:53,400
to its final destination,

3354
05:47:53,400 --> 05:47:54,400
but according to what I've heard,

3355
05:47:54,400 --> 05:47:56,400
it vanished right from their armory.

3356
05:47:56,400 --> 05:47:58,400
I wish I knew how you were able to slip by the guards,

3357
05:47:58,400 --> 05:48:01,400
bypass the porticolas,

3358
05:48:01,400 --> 05:48:05,400
unlock the armory door and break in at the door of a puzzle locked chest.

3359
05:48:05,400 --> 05:48:07,400
You need to teach me that little trick sometime.

3360
05:48:07,400 --> 05:48:09,400
I've left your cut in the usual drop spot

3361
05:48:09,400 --> 05:48:11,400
and might have another drop where you soon are.

3362
05:48:13,400 --> 05:48:15,400
There's three more books of it.

3363
05:48:15,400 --> 05:48:16,400
Oh, my God.

3364
05:48:16,400 --> 05:48:18,400
I knew the books existed.

3365
05:48:18,400 --> 05:48:19,400
Wait, what am I doing?

3366
05:48:20,400 --> 05:48:22,400
Egg spare.

3367
05:48:24,400 --> 05:48:26,400
Can we do it?

3368
05:48:30,400 --> 05:48:31,400
Okay.

3369
05:48:32,400 --> 05:48:35,400
But we have it.

3370
05:48:36,400 --> 05:48:38,400
Easy.

3371
05:48:39,400 --> 05:48:40,400
Easy.

3372
05:48:40,400 --> 05:48:42,400
Okay, a bit more, I think.

3373
05:48:42,400 --> 05:48:44,400
Or maybe it was left, I don't know.

3374
05:48:46,400 --> 05:48:47,400
Okay, maybe it's left.

3375
05:48:47,400 --> 05:48:48,400
Do you know that?

3376
05:48:49,400 --> 05:48:50,400
Easy.

3377
05:48:53,400 --> 05:48:54,400
Easy.

3378
05:48:54,400 --> 05:48:55,400
I'm getting nervous.

3379
05:48:56,400 --> 05:48:57,400
Easy.

3380
05:49:03,400 --> 05:49:04,400
Alright, we got children.

3381
05:49:04,400 --> 05:49:05,400
I'll take children.

3382
05:49:05,400 --> 05:49:07,400
Not a bother at all.

3383
05:49:07,400 --> 05:49:09,400
Not a bother at all.

3384
05:49:13,400 --> 05:49:14,400
The rat wave.

3385
05:49:16,400 --> 05:49:17,400
Let's go.

3386
05:49:23,400 --> 05:49:27,400
I don't remember what way to go.

3387
05:49:27,400 --> 05:49:28,400
Is it this one?

3388
05:49:31,400 --> 05:49:33,400
Oh, no, this is if you want Dragonborn.

3389
05:49:33,400 --> 05:49:34,400
Oops.

3390
05:49:35,400 --> 05:49:37,400
Can you stop attacking me?

3391
05:49:37,400 --> 05:49:39,400
Whoa, your bull.

3392
05:49:39,400 --> 05:49:41,400
It's an imperial bull.

3393
05:49:41,400 --> 05:49:46,400
I think an imperial bull is better than what I've got right now.

3394
05:49:46,400 --> 05:49:50,400
Although mine does have burn damage, so...

3395
05:49:50,400 --> 05:49:52,400
I wish YouTube had other emotes.

3396
05:49:52,400 --> 05:49:53,400
I know.

3397
05:49:54,400 --> 05:49:59,400
YouTube is like very slowly catching up to the appeal of...

3398
05:50:01,400 --> 05:50:03,400
I'm not doing any more lock picking on that now.

3399
05:50:03,400 --> 05:50:07,400
YouTube is very slowly catching up to what the appeal of Twitch is.

3400
05:50:07,400 --> 05:50:10,400
To the point where it is going to take over Twitch.

3401
05:50:10,400 --> 05:50:11,400
I'm sorry.

3402
05:50:11,400 --> 05:50:12,400
It just is.

3403
05:50:13,400 --> 05:50:15,400
Why did I jump down?

3404
05:50:15,400 --> 05:50:18,400
I've just added so much time to this travel.

3405
05:50:20,400 --> 05:50:28,400
I did not recall how long it takes to place Skyrim.

3406
05:50:29,400 --> 05:50:32,400
We're literally not even finished one questline yet.

3407
05:50:33,400 --> 05:50:38,400
Tear him up, Lydia.

3408
05:50:40,400 --> 05:50:42,400
Okay, there we go.

3409
05:50:44,400 --> 05:50:45,400
Emmy's Rats.

3410
05:50:46,400 --> 05:50:48,400
I'm so confused. Where did that come from?

3411
05:50:48,400 --> 05:50:50,400
I dropped down there.

3412
05:50:52,400 --> 05:50:53,400
Okay.

3413
05:50:54,400 --> 05:50:55,400
There you go.

3414
05:50:55,400 --> 05:50:56,400
Channel emotes soon.

3415
05:50:56,400 --> 05:51:00,400
Channel emotes literally less than 24 hours. Have fun.

3416
05:51:00,400 --> 05:51:03,400
Am I supposed to speak to Brineo?

3417
05:51:03,400 --> 05:51:04,400
Okay.

3418
05:51:04,400 --> 05:51:05,400
You know what?

3419
05:51:05,400 --> 05:51:09,400
If I had that selected, that probably would have gone a lot faster than what I just did there.

3420
05:51:11,400 --> 05:51:13,400
Underestimating the 1000 plus hours game.

3421
05:51:13,400 --> 05:51:16,400
Literally, I was like, right, we'll do the Thieves Guild.

3422
05:51:16,400 --> 05:51:17,400
We'll do Dark Brotherhood.

3423
05:51:17,400 --> 05:51:20,400
We're literally six hours into this stream.

3424
05:51:20,400 --> 05:51:24,400
I've less than six hours and I've not even finished Thieves.

3425
05:51:24,400 --> 05:51:25,400
Oh, sorry.

3426
05:51:25,400 --> 05:51:26,400
Sorry.

3427
05:51:26,400 --> 05:51:27,400
I got a bit excited there.

3428
05:51:27,400 --> 05:51:28,400
I apologize.

3429
05:51:31,400 --> 05:51:32,400
Okay.

3430
05:51:32,400 --> 05:51:33,400
Let's do that.

3431
05:51:33,400 --> 05:51:34,400
How much?

3432
05:51:35,400 --> 05:51:36,400
How many?

3433
05:51:36,400 --> 05:51:37,400
How much heavy am I?

3434
05:51:37,400 --> 05:51:38,400
Curry?

3435
05:51:38,400 --> 05:51:40,400
Wait, it's 2.18 out of 3.30.

3436
05:51:40,400 --> 05:51:41,400
That'll do.

3437
05:51:41,400 --> 05:51:43,400
I need like a hundred stuff.

3438
05:51:43,400 --> 05:51:44,400
Hi, Carlaya.

3439
05:51:46,400 --> 05:51:47,400
How long do we have?

3440
05:51:47,400 --> 05:51:49,400
Yeah, less than six hours because of this.

3441
05:51:49,400 --> 05:51:50,400
Oops.

3442
05:51:51,400 --> 05:51:52,400
I'm sorry.

3443
05:51:52,400 --> 05:51:53,400
I'm sorry.

3444
05:51:54,400 --> 05:51:55,400
Oops.

3445
05:51:55,400 --> 05:51:56,400
I'm sorry.

3446
05:51:56,400 --> 05:51:57,400
I'm sorry.

3447
05:52:00,400 --> 05:52:01,400
No.

3448
05:52:01,400 --> 05:52:03,400
Why is two people inviting me to talk?

3449
05:52:03,400 --> 05:52:04,400
There's too many people.

3450
05:52:07,400 --> 05:52:08,400
Wait.

3451
05:52:08,400 --> 05:52:10,400
So do you do every sequel?

3452
05:52:10,400 --> 05:52:11,400
No.

3453
05:52:11,400 --> 05:52:14,400
I was just going to do Thieves Guild.

3454
05:52:14,400 --> 05:52:15,400
Black.

3455
05:52:17,400 --> 05:52:19,400
Assassins.

3456
05:52:19,400 --> 05:52:20,400
What?

3457
05:52:20,400 --> 05:52:21,400
That's not what they're called.

3458
05:52:22,400 --> 05:52:24,400
The Dark Brotherhood.

3459
05:52:25,400 --> 05:52:26,400
And then The Vampire.

3460
05:52:26,400 --> 05:52:27,400
And then The Mean Quest.

3461
05:52:27,400 --> 05:52:29,400
And I've done nothing yet.

3462
05:52:29,400 --> 05:52:31,400
So I don't think it's happening.

3463
05:52:33,400 --> 05:52:34,400
Dark Brotherhood.

3464
05:52:34,400 --> 05:52:35,400
Yes.

3465
05:52:37,400 --> 05:52:39,400
Hybrony of Smashes Into Wall.

3466
05:52:44,400 --> 05:52:46,400
The Trinity of Streams on YouTube.

3467
05:52:46,400 --> 05:52:50,400
YouTube Shorts of Recycles Clips with 10 Minutes Highlights on the same platform.

3468
05:52:51,400 --> 05:52:54,400
And also just a cheat for exposure.

3469
05:52:54,400 --> 05:52:56,400
Yeah, like Twitch is exposed.

3470
05:52:56,400 --> 05:53:00,400
It's very interesting to see breakdowns on either website.

3471
05:53:00,400 --> 05:53:03,400
Like, I've just...

3472
05:53:03,400 --> 05:53:05,400
Meet Karlai at the Sanding Zone.

3473
05:53:05,400 --> 05:53:07,400
Okay, we're about to become a Nightingale.

3474
05:53:07,400 --> 05:53:09,400
I know I've literally skipped through all the dialogue.

3475
05:53:09,400 --> 05:53:13,400
So for anyone who hasn't consumed Skyrim and is listening in at home,

3476
05:53:13,400 --> 05:53:15,400
I apologize greatly.

3477
05:53:15,400 --> 05:53:19,400
I can just give you the TLDR.

3478
05:53:19,400 --> 05:53:24,400
I'm more than happy to provide such a thing for you.

3479
05:53:24,400 --> 05:53:26,400
How the heck do I get out of this area?

3480
05:53:30,400 --> 05:53:32,400
I'll just go out of the docks.

3481
05:53:32,400 --> 05:53:33,400
How about that?

3482
05:53:34,400 --> 05:53:36,400
I don't think you can jump over.

3483
05:53:37,400 --> 05:53:40,400
If you haven't played Skyrim, go play Skyrim.

3484
05:53:41,400 --> 05:53:42,400
Mind yourself.

3485
05:53:42,400 --> 05:53:43,400
Mind yourself.

3486
05:53:44,400 --> 05:53:45,400
I'd be a Rifting Guard.

3487
05:53:45,400 --> 05:53:46,400
I'd be like, yeah.

3488
05:53:47,400 --> 05:53:48,400
You stink.

3489
05:53:48,400 --> 05:53:50,400
Don't be causing trouble.

3490
05:53:53,400 --> 05:53:54,400
Ooh.

3491
05:53:54,400 --> 05:53:55,400
Hi, Maul.

3492
05:53:59,400 --> 05:54:01,400
Any news involving the Dark Brotherhood?

3493
05:54:05,400 --> 05:54:06,400
Oh!

3494
05:54:06,400 --> 05:54:07,400
That's the other...

3495
05:54:07,400 --> 05:54:09,400
That's the Brotherhood Quest.

3496
05:54:09,400 --> 05:54:11,400
Well, that was lucky we talked to him to get that,

3497
05:54:11,400 --> 05:54:15,400
because we probably just have to kill Grelok the kind.

3498
05:54:15,400 --> 05:54:18,400
And she's actually not very keen.

3499
05:54:18,400 --> 05:54:19,400
What's this?

3500
05:54:19,400 --> 05:54:20,400
Oh, it's a clay deposit.

3501
05:54:23,400 --> 05:54:25,400
The Thieves Guild quest line is mostly yapping at this point.

3502
05:54:25,400 --> 05:54:27,400
Honestly, we're about to become Nightingales,

3503
05:54:27,400 --> 05:54:30,400
and it's about to be yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

3504
05:54:30,400 --> 05:54:31,400
I thought I was a good yapper.

3505
05:54:31,400 --> 05:54:32,400
Mm-mm.

3506
05:54:32,400 --> 05:54:34,400
Yap-yap-yap-yap-yap-yap.

3507
05:54:34,400 --> 05:54:35,400
Hello.

3508
05:54:35,400 --> 05:54:36,400
Hiya!

3509
05:54:37,400 --> 05:54:38,400
I'm glad you're here.

3510
05:54:38,400 --> 05:54:39,400
I'm glad you're here.

3511
05:54:39,400 --> 05:54:42,400
What's the significance of this place?

3512
05:54:42,400 --> 05:54:45,400
This is the headquarters of the Nightingales.

3513
05:54:45,400 --> 05:54:48,400
Cut into the mountainside by the first of our kind.

3514
05:54:48,400 --> 05:54:49,400
See?

3515
05:54:49,400 --> 05:54:52,400
We've come to seek the edge we need to defeat Mercer Frey.

3516
05:54:52,400 --> 05:54:53,400
Okay, yeah.

3517
05:54:53,400 --> 05:54:55,400
What kind of an edge?

3518
05:54:57,400 --> 05:54:59,400
What kind of an edge?

3519
05:54:59,400 --> 05:55:03,400
If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.

3520
05:55:03,400 --> 05:55:04,400
Yeah.

3521
05:55:04,400 --> 05:55:06,400
This way, please.

3522
05:55:07,400 --> 05:55:10,400
Yeah, let's edge this way, please.

3523
05:55:11,400 --> 05:55:13,400
Oh, look at them steps.

3524
05:55:13,400 --> 05:55:15,400
Mm, look at that bow, though.

3525
05:55:15,400 --> 05:55:17,400
Actually, one level.

3526
05:55:17,400 --> 05:55:22,400
Look at the satchel that the arrow's going.

3527
05:55:22,400 --> 05:55:26,400
I like how they're coded to look like what the arrow is.

3528
05:55:26,400 --> 05:55:27,400
Very nice.

3529
05:55:27,400 --> 05:55:29,400
Very, very nice.

3530
05:55:35,400 --> 05:55:38,400
I never believed that it existed.

3531
05:55:38,400 --> 05:55:40,400
I took enough and I'm back.

3532
05:55:40,400 --> 05:55:42,400
Are you surprised I'm still on?

3533
05:55:44,400 --> 05:55:46,400
Is Emi streaming today?

3534
05:55:46,400 --> 05:55:47,400
Emi?

3535
05:55:47,400 --> 05:55:48,400
Or is it?

3536
05:55:48,400 --> 05:55:51,400
No, Emi should already be on.

3537
05:55:51,400 --> 05:55:56,400
Azur should be coming online in two minutes.

3538
05:55:56,400 --> 05:55:59,400
If I have my times correct.

3539
05:56:02,400 --> 05:56:04,400
Emi's off today.

3540
05:56:05,400 --> 05:56:08,400
Just Sheevie and Mercy, so Mercy's on at one.

3541
05:56:08,400 --> 05:56:11,400
Right, we'll redirect into Mercy.

3542
05:56:11,400 --> 05:56:12,400
Deal?

3543
05:56:12,400 --> 05:56:13,400
I'll make you a deal.

3544
05:56:13,400 --> 05:56:15,400
We'll redirect into Mercy.

3545
05:56:19,400 --> 05:56:23,400
Yeah, but we're in the Nightingale like Robin Hood or something?

3546
05:56:23,400 --> 05:56:30,400
I, the first time I did this, like the Nightingale quest,

3547
05:56:30,400 --> 05:56:33,400
I was in love with Lady Luck.

3548
05:56:33,400 --> 05:56:35,400
I absolutely just...

3549
05:56:36,400 --> 05:56:38,400
Ow, I was very loud in my ear.

3550
05:56:38,400 --> 05:56:40,400
Hopefully that wasn't too loud in your ear.

3551
05:56:40,400 --> 05:56:48,400
I just absolutely and truly adored the little plot.

3552
05:56:50,400 --> 05:56:53,400
I like so cool.

3553
05:56:53,400 --> 05:56:57,400
I just look so amazing and awesome.

3554
05:56:57,400 --> 05:57:00,400
Everything, I am ready for the oath.

3555
05:57:00,400 --> 05:57:02,400
Now you go get changed.

3556
05:57:03,400 --> 05:57:05,400
Best looking armor in the game.

3557
05:57:05,400 --> 05:57:09,400
Honestly, this armor and Dark Brotherhood armor, yeah.

3558
05:57:09,400 --> 05:57:11,400
That's awesome.

3559
05:57:15,400 --> 05:57:19,400
I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.

3560
05:57:19,400 --> 05:57:23,400
I may have misheard you, but Mercy is in three hours.

3561
05:57:23,400 --> 05:57:24,400
No one.

3562
05:57:24,400 --> 05:57:28,400
Yeah, no, Mercy comes online at one o'clock for me.

3563
05:57:28,400 --> 05:57:30,400
One o'clock in the afternoon, yeah?

3564
05:57:30,400 --> 05:57:32,400
That's when Mercy comes online for me.

3565
05:57:32,400 --> 05:57:35,400
So, Mercy's actually perfect for us.

3566
05:57:54,400 --> 05:57:56,400
An arrangement must be struck.

3567
05:57:56,400 --> 05:57:58,400
So dramatic.

3568
05:58:00,400 --> 05:58:03,400
What time did I start streaming?

3569
05:58:03,400 --> 05:58:06,400
Oh, you started streaming, yeah?

3570
05:58:06,400 --> 05:58:09,400
At 4 a.m., yeah?

3571
05:58:09,400 --> 05:58:11,400
I started at 4 a.m.

3572
05:58:13,400 --> 05:58:17,400
You never wondered why everyone's schedule has a cheeky time zone

3573
05:58:17,400 --> 05:58:19,400
that no one uses,

3574
05:58:19,400 --> 05:58:21,400
because that's my time zone.

3575
05:58:24,400 --> 05:58:27,400
Straining on those night hours, yeah?

3576
05:58:28,400 --> 05:58:31,400
Yes, I will become Nightingale.

3577
05:58:31,400 --> 05:58:33,400
Yes, I'm ready.

3578
05:58:35,400 --> 05:58:38,400
Please stand on the western circle.

3579
05:58:38,400 --> 05:58:41,400
Holy crap, 4 a.m., yeah?

3580
05:58:41,400 --> 05:58:44,400
The reason why I stream so early

3581
05:58:44,400 --> 05:58:48,400
is in case I need to do stuff during the day.

3582
05:58:48,400 --> 05:58:53,400
Originally, it was either I stream at 4 a.m. or I stream at 10 a.m.

3583
05:58:53,400 --> 05:58:56,400
But the problem is, if I stream at 10 a.m.,

3584
05:58:56,400 --> 05:59:00,400
the day is over by the time I finish my endurance streams.

3585
05:59:00,400 --> 05:59:05,400
So, I wouldn't be able to do doctor's appointments if I need to make it.

3586
05:59:05,400 --> 05:59:08,400
Lydia, you're going to ruin this so much.

3587
05:59:08,400 --> 05:59:11,400
Please stand elsewhere.

3588
05:59:11,400 --> 05:59:13,400
Or just go...

3589
05:59:13,400 --> 05:59:16,400
Lydia, you're going to ruin this scene so much.

3590
05:59:16,400 --> 05:59:18,400
I'm not being funny.

3591
05:59:18,400 --> 05:59:22,400
Come here, Lydia. You're going to ruin the awesomeness of this scene.

3592
05:59:22,400 --> 05:59:24,400
Lydia.

3593
05:59:24,400 --> 05:59:26,400
Wait here.

3594
05:59:26,400 --> 05:59:29,400
Thank you. There's such a beautiful cinematic coming up

3595
05:59:29,400 --> 05:59:31,400
and they don't know what it is yet.

3596
05:59:31,400 --> 05:59:34,400
Just let it happen.

3597
05:59:34,400 --> 05:59:36,400
Oh, not Lydia standing in the corner, right?

3598
05:59:36,400 --> 05:59:38,400
Just don't look at her. Don't acknowledge her, okay?

3599
05:59:38,400 --> 05:59:41,400
She's like a dinosaur.

3600
05:59:41,400 --> 05:59:44,400
Alright, let's enjoy this because this is actually pretty cool.

3601
05:59:52,400 --> 05:59:55,400
I've come before you to throw myself upon your mercy

3602
05:59:55,400 --> 05:59:58,400
and to accept responsibility for my failure.

3603
05:59:58,400 --> 06:00:01,400
You're already mine, Carlisle.

3604
06:00:01,400 --> 06:00:04,400
Your terms were struck long ago.

3605
06:00:04,400 --> 06:00:08,400
What could you possibly offer me now?

3606
06:00:08,400 --> 06:00:11,400
I have two others that wish to transact the oath

3607
06:00:11,400 --> 06:00:14,400
to serve you both in life and in death.

3608
06:00:14,400 --> 06:00:17,400
You surprise me, Carlisle.

3609
06:00:17,400 --> 06:00:20,400
This offer is definitely weighted in my favor.

3610
06:00:20,400 --> 06:00:22,400
In my favor.

3611
06:00:42,400 --> 06:00:44,400
I ain't saying none of this.

3612
06:00:50,400 --> 06:00:52,400
What's the next?

3613
06:01:06,400 --> 06:01:08,400
Monka.

3614
06:01:12,400 --> 06:01:14,400
Wait, we don't get to see her?

3615
06:01:16,400 --> 06:01:18,400
I didn't see her.

3616
06:01:18,400 --> 06:01:20,400
Norm, I thought we got to see her.

3617
06:01:20,400 --> 06:01:22,400
I guess it's with the next cinematic.

3618
06:01:22,400 --> 06:01:24,400
What do you mean, we?

3619
06:01:27,400 --> 06:01:29,400
Yes, it's true, Crane.

3620
06:01:30,400 --> 06:01:32,400
He's done more.

3621
06:01:36,400 --> 06:01:38,400
The Scaly Key.

3622
06:01:40,400 --> 06:01:42,400
Big Scaly.

3623
06:01:43,400 --> 06:01:46,400
So the key doesn't lock any doors.

3624
06:02:06,400 --> 06:02:09,400
The three sounds like no one should possess it.

3625
06:02:12,400 --> 06:02:15,400
It's too much power for one human to have.

3626
06:02:19,400 --> 06:02:21,400
We see her when we return the key.

3627
06:02:21,400 --> 06:02:23,400
Yes, we will do that.

3628
06:02:33,400 --> 06:02:36,400
First time I've ever set out to return something?

3629
06:02:43,400 --> 06:02:45,400
Let's go then.

3630
06:02:48,400 --> 06:02:51,400
Alright, Big Brinny, what's up?

3631
06:02:58,400 --> 06:03:00,400
Oh my God, he's tapping his feet.

3632
06:03:00,400 --> 06:03:02,400
Oh, he's doing the Irish dance for us.

3633
06:03:12,400 --> 06:03:14,400
After we deal with him,

3634
06:03:14,400 --> 06:03:17,400
all that remains is restoring the guild to its full strength.

3635
06:03:17,400 --> 06:03:21,400
As a result, there won't be anything that you have attention to.

3636
06:03:27,400 --> 06:03:30,400
I've been at this game a long time, my friend.

3637
06:03:30,400 --> 06:03:32,400
A long time. I've stolen trinkets from nobles,

3638
06:03:32,400 --> 06:03:34,400
and turned priests for murder.

3639
06:03:34,400 --> 06:03:36,400
I'm good at what I do.

3640
06:03:36,400 --> 06:03:38,400
Maybe even one of the best,

3641
06:03:38,400 --> 06:03:40,400
but it's all I know.

3642
06:03:40,400 --> 06:03:42,400
It's on your words, but your foot is moving

3643
06:03:42,400 --> 06:03:44,400
and it's making me laugh.

3644
06:03:47,400 --> 06:03:49,400
It's about time. No, it's not right.

3645
06:03:49,400 --> 06:03:51,400
I don't know what to say.

3646
06:03:55,400 --> 06:03:58,400
So don't get sentimental on me now, I accept.

3647
06:04:03,400 --> 06:04:05,400
We'll handle the details.

3648
06:04:05,400 --> 06:04:09,400
Oh, we have quite the task ahead.

3649
06:04:09,400 --> 06:04:11,400
Then let's get to it.

3650
06:04:14,400 --> 06:04:17,400
What if we try to use the key on strongy?

3651
06:04:17,400 --> 06:04:20,400
And in playing, you don't have free reign of me?

3652
06:04:21,400 --> 06:04:24,400
Reef playing, you know me better than that.

3653
06:04:30,400 --> 06:04:33,400
Lydia, I'm sorry that I put you in exile.

3654
06:04:33,400 --> 06:04:35,400
Yes, follow me.

3655
06:04:35,400 --> 06:04:37,400
My thing.

3656
06:04:38,400 --> 06:04:41,400
I can't believe I made myself Lydia 2.0.

3657
06:04:41,400 --> 06:04:44,400
Strongy using the key on reefing?

3658
06:04:46,400 --> 06:04:49,400
It's funny, you think you have any resistance against me.

3659
06:04:59,400 --> 06:05:02,400
Roy is regaining his own foot in the way he tap him.

3660
06:05:03,400 --> 06:05:05,400
Here.

3661
06:05:08,400 --> 06:05:11,400
Oh yeah, becoming the guild master is bugged

3662
06:05:11,400 --> 06:05:13,400
if you don't do the radiant quest first.

3663
06:05:13,400 --> 06:05:16,400
Oh, I've always managed to do them after.

3664
06:05:17,400 --> 06:05:19,400
I don't even know how they...

3665
06:05:19,400 --> 06:05:23,400
Where the heck do you expect me to go?

3666
06:05:24,400 --> 06:05:26,400
Eh, let's do that then.

3667
06:05:26,400 --> 06:05:29,400
Strongy, considering you don't have many lockpicks,

3668
06:05:29,400 --> 06:05:32,400
it may be beneficial just to hold on to it for a while.

3669
06:05:32,400 --> 06:05:34,400
Honestly though.

3670
06:05:34,400 --> 06:05:36,400
Right, I need to go a little to the left.

3671
06:05:36,400 --> 06:05:39,400
Not to be confused with the hit steam game.

3672
06:05:39,400 --> 06:05:41,400
A little to the left.

3673
06:05:42,400 --> 06:05:44,400
Let's get to it.

3674
06:05:44,400 --> 06:05:47,400
If I can get up this hill, then the enemies in that building

3675
06:05:47,400 --> 06:05:49,400
won't be able to annoy me.

3676
06:05:49,400 --> 06:05:51,400
Why would I resist strongy?

3677
06:05:51,400 --> 06:05:53,400
Exactly, why would you?

3678
06:05:53,400 --> 06:05:55,400
Anyone who puts up with me?

3679
06:05:55,400 --> 06:05:57,400
Anyone who puts up a fight gets...

3680
06:05:58,400 --> 06:06:00,400
Twice as hard.

3681
06:06:02,400 --> 06:06:05,400
Hopefully you can figure out what the substitute was for that word.

3682
06:06:06,400 --> 06:06:07,400
That's terrible.

3683
06:06:07,400 --> 06:06:08,400
Wait, that's north.

3684
06:06:08,400 --> 06:06:09,400
I'm going the wrong way.

3685
06:06:09,400 --> 06:06:11,400
No, it's like along the waterfront.

3686
06:06:14,400 --> 06:06:16,400
And just what?

3687
06:06:16,400 --> 06:06:18,400
Sounds good.

3688
06:06:18,400 --> 06:06:19,400
Hi, strongy.

3689
06:06:19,400 --> 06:06:21,400
Dang, you're going hard into this game.

3690
06:06:21,400 --> 06:06:23,400
We haven't even finished one quest lane yet.

3691
06:06:23,400 --> 06:06:25,400
It's officially been six hours

3692
06:06:25,400 --> 06:06:27,400
and I haven't finished one quest lane.

3693
06:06:27,400 --> 06:06:29,400
I completely forgot how

3694
06:06:29,400 --> 06:06:32,400
just humongous what this game is.

3695
06:06:32,400 --> 06:06:34,400
It's extraordinary

3696
06:06:36,400 --> 06:06:38,400
that I haven't actually...

3697
06:06:38,400 --> 06:06:40,400
I'm about to get close to finishing the thieves.

3698
06:06:40,400 --> 06:06:42,400
But even then, I'm not even going to truly finish them

3699
06:06:42,400 --> 06:06:44,400
due to the reason

3700
06:06:44,400 --> 06:06:46,400
of...

3701
06:06:47,400 --> 06:06:49,400
of what?

3702
06:06:50,400 --> 06:06:52,400
Of...

3703
06:06:52,400 --> 06:06:54,400
Because we're not even going to do

3704
06:06:54,400 --> 06:06:56,400
those miscellaneous quests for the Thief's Guild

3705
06:06:56,400 --> 06:06:58,400
to restore it to its final glory.

3706
06:06:59,400 --> 06:07:01,400
Cause...

3707
06:07:01,400 --> 06:07:03,400
Do I take the lift here?

3708
06:07:03,400 --> 06:07:05,400
No, I still don't take the lift.

3709
06:07:06,400 --> 06:07:08,400
Keep the skeleton key for yourself.

3710
06:07:08,400 --> 06:07:10,400
No, I'll be a good girl

3711
06:07:10,400 --> 06:07:12,400
because I want to see a mummy nocturnal.

3712
06:07:12,400 --> 06:07:14,400
I really like her design.

3713
06:07:16,400 --> 06:07:18,400
I wouldn't mind

3714
06:07:18,400 --> 06:07:20,400
incorporating...

3715
06:07:20,400 --> 06:07:22,400
I wouldn't mind.

3716
06:07:22,400 --> 06:07:24,400
It's a very good design.

3717
06:07:24,400 --> 06:07:26,400
Now the heck did I get where I'm going?

3718
06:07:26,400 --> 06:07:28,400
Literally every time I have to go somewhere

3719
06:07:28,400 --> 06:07:30,400
I just start spamming E on a hill

3720
06:07:30,400 --> 06:07:32,400
and I'm like, is this where I'm supposed to go?

3721
06:07:33,400 --> 06:07:35,400
No, I don't really have to walk up the hill yet.

3722
06:07:35,400 --> 06:07:37,400
No, I don't have to walk up the hill.

3723
06:07:37,400 --> 06:07:39,400
It's fine. It's fine.

3724
06:07:39,400 --> 06:07:41,400
I saw that orbing.

3725
06:07:42,400 --> 06:07:44,400
I'm not sure if I should resist or not.

3726
06:07:44,400 --> 06:07:47,400
Either way, the outcome is clear.

3727
06:07:48,400 --> 06:07:50,400
The hard...

3728
06:07:50,400 --> 06:07:52,400
Oh, I thought it was the wind.

3729
06:07:52,400 --> 06:07:54,400
It was rules.

3730
06:07:54,400 --> 06:07:56,400
You don't need the key when you get a log pick into a hundred.

3731
06:07:56,400 --> 06:07:58,400
Oh, I didn't mean that.

3732
06:07:58,400 --> 06:08:01,400
Does everything just become easy piece of lemon squeezy?

3733
06:08:01,400 --> 06:08:04,400
Or do the log picks not break on a hundred or something?

3734
06:08:04,400 --> 06:08:06,400
We're getting there.

3735
06:08:06,400 --> 06:08:08,400
We can do it. I believe in us.

3736
06:08:08,400 --> 06:08:10,400
We're just a little exhausted.

3737
06:08:12,400 --> 06:08:14,400
I'm scarous.

3738
06:08:14,400 --> 06:08:16,400
I thought for some reason

3739
06:08:16,400 --> 06:08:18,400
you said I'm scouse

3740
06:08:18,400 --> 06:08:20,400
and I was like, right?

3741
06:08:20,400 --> 06:08:22,400
Now what?

3742
06:08:22,400 --> 06:08:24,400
Oh yeah, by the way, I'm scouse.

3743
06:08:24,400 --> 06:08:26,400
I like the way you talk, Scottish lass.

3744
06:08:28,400 --> 06:08:30,400
You know, right?

3745
06:08:30,400 --> 06:08:32,400
Can I buy a cheeky Maccas?

3746
06:08:32,400 --> 06:08:34,400
Wait, Maccas is Australian term.

3747
06:08:34,400 --> 06:08:36,400
I can't believe it.

3748
06:08:36,400 --> 06:08:38,400
We're boarding live here today.

3749
06:08:38,400 --> 06:08:40,400
Today, we are going to...

3750
06:08:40,400 --> 06:08:44,400
This place is actually covered in bandits.

3751
06:08:44,400 --> 06:08:46,400
I cannot for the life of me doing Australian accent.

3752
06:08:50,400 --> 06:08:52,400
Right, what's this?

3753
06:08:52,400 --> 06:08:54,400
A gate. Open the gate. Why not?

3754
06:08:54,400 --> 06:08:56,400
That might come and help me

3755
06:08:56,400 --> 06:08:58,400
with future...

3756
06:08:58,400 --> 06:09:00,400
Go on a Maccas run, yeah?

3757
06:09:00,400 --> 06:09:02,400
Get in void with me, yeah?

3758
06:09:02,400 --> 06:09:04,400
Oh, I thought I was going to one-shot you.

3759
06:09:04,400 --> 06:09:06,400
I'm going to be honest.

3760
06:09:06,400 --> 06:09:08,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can beg for mercy

3761
06:09:08,400 --> 06:09:10,400
when you're dead.

3762
06:09:14,400 --> 06:09:16,400
P-pop-pop...

3763
06:09:26,400 --> 06:09:28,400
Oh, I bonked him. Right, give me that.

3764
06:09:28,400 --> 06:09:30,400
I will destroy that.

3765
06:09:30,400 --> 06:09:32,400
What is this? Can someone look this up?

3766
06:09:32,400 --> 06:09:34,400
What am I supposed to do with this?

3767
06:09:34,400 --> 06:09:36,400
Flawed Var-la Stone.

3768
06:09:36,400 --> 06:09:38,400
I don't know what it is.

3769
06:09:38,400 --> 06:09:40,400
Flawed Var-la Stone.

3770
06:09:40,400 --> 06:09:42,400
I've never seen them before.

3771
06:09:42,400 --> 06:09:47,400
before PC seems to have them, Xbox doesn't seem to have them.

3772
06:09:47,400 --> 06:09:49,200
But Mercedes in three hours!

3773
06:09:49,200 --> 06:09:50,800
Say a shout out to Mercedes!

3774
06:09:50,800 --> 06:09:52,600
Sorry, I got a lot of gold itch on my head.

3775
06:09:52,600 --> 06:09:55,000
I like to see them.

3776
06:09:55,000 --> 06:09:58,700
Speak to Carlaya.

3777
06:09:58,700 --> 06:10:02,800
Ooh, they got a good look.

3778
06:10:02,800 --> 06:10:07,800
Expert is about much, I've done that for souls.

3779
06:10:07,800 --> 06:10:10,500
Right, the machines drop.

3780
06:10:10,500 --> 06:10:14,700
Where's Lydia?

3781
06:10:14,700 --> 06:10:17,000
Lydia, you do this all the time.

3782
06:10:17,000 --> 06:10:20,300
There should be an enemy that pops out of here, yeah.

3783
06:10:20,300 --> 06:10:21,400
Oh, that's right, I remember.

3784
06:10:21,400 --> 06:10:24,600
These guys used to treat me out.

3785
06:10:24,600 --> 06:10:27,600
I'm actually, I'll tell you what, that was like really loud.

3786
06:10:27,600 --> 06:10:31,200
I'm going to...

3787
06:10:31,200 --> 06:10:35,800
...settings, audio.

3788
06:10:35,800 --> 06:10:37,600
Is that a bit better on your ears?

3789
06:10:37,600 --> 06:10:43,500
I feel like whenever that happens, it's so loud.

3790
06:10:43,500 --> 06:10:46,800
A new hand has touched the beacon.

3791
06:10:46,800 --> 06:10:48,200
Now, these do drop, yeah.

3792
06:10:48,200 --> 06:10:53,300
That's exactly what I'm wanting, like tons of these soul gems.

3793
06:10:53,300 --> 06:10:54,000
Where's the enemy?

3794
06:10:54,000 --> 06:10:55,500
I love the enemy.

3795
06:10:55,500 --> 06:10:57,400
Just got an enemy.

3796
06:10:57,400 --> 06:10:59,300
Ooh, hold on.

3797
06:10:59,300 --> 06:11:00,900
My two hands is 46.

3798
06:11:00,900 --> 06:11:04,600
We're getting there, we're getting there.

3799
06:11:04,600 --> 06:11:06,200
Yes, oh my goodness.

3800
06:11:06,200 --> 06:11:09,800
This is what we want, like massive amounts of these soul gems.

3801
06:11:09,800 --> 06:11:13,300
And then we can put like really good stuff on.

3802
06:11:13,300 --> 06:11:17,600
There should be one that pops out of here.

3803
06:11:17,600 --> 06:11:18,600
Yeah.

3804
06:11:18,600 --> 06:11:19,900
Oh, I'm getting too good.

3805
06:11:19,900 --> 06:11:23,400
I'm genuinely too good at this game, I'm sorry.

3806
06:11:23,400 --> 06:11:26,200
The fact that I remember from childhood,

3807
06:11:26,200 --> 06:11:28,900
where the enemies like come out.

3808
06:11:28,900 --> 06:11:35,000
I'm not sure how scared I was with the enemies.

3809
06:11:35,000 --> 06:11:35,900
Come here.

3810
06:11:35,900 --> 06:11:37,500
Okay, there we go.

3811
06:11:37,500 --> 06:11:39,500
What was that, three to scavenge?

3812
06:11:39,500 --> 06:11:42,800
Oh, I'll take it, I'll take it.

3813
06:11:42,800 --> 06:11:44,200
I'll take it, I'll take anything.

3814
06:11:44,200 --> 06:11:48,200
I'm happy with anything, any offerings I'll take.

3815
06:11:48,200 --> 06:11:52,100
Oh, yeah.

3816
06:11:52,100 --> 06:11:55,000
Is the enemy from here?

3817
06:11:55,000 --> 06:11:57,000
Here.

3818
06:11:57,000 --> 06:11:58,900
Oh, I heard that.

3819
06:11:58,900 --> 06:12:07,100
I heard them like spidering up here.

3820
06:12:07,100 --> 06:12:13,300
I can hear enemy.

3821
06:12:13,300 --> 06:12:19,600
Oh, I heard two just one in there, but I need to go here.

3822
06:12:19,600 --> 06:12:22,900
They're so tiny.

3823
06:12:22,900 --> 06:12:26,500
They're so tiny.

3824
06:12:26,500 --> 06:12:28,800
Oh, we are getting so many soldiers.

3825
06:12:28,800 --> 06:12:32,100
This is exactly what I was needing, one of the runs in here.

3826
06:12:32,100 --> 06:12:38,400
That spawn sneak is actually impressive.

3827
06:12:38,400 --> 06:12:44,800
Ah.

3828
06:12:44,800 --> 06:12:47,900
There, them.

3829
06:12:47,900 --> 06:12:49,400
Okay, we can destroy that.

3830
06:12:49,400 --> 06:12:54,600
Yeah, let's go.

3831
06:12:54,700 --> 06:12:58,200
Alchemy, Arvin.

3832
06:12:58,200 --> 06:13:01,800
Yeah, yeah, I'll take the potions, let's go.

3833
06:13:01,800 --> 06:13:07,400
Oh my god, I just jumped in real life because of that noise of that latch.

3834
06:13:07,400 --> 06:13:09,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3835
06:13:09,600 --> 06:13:12,900
Oh, hello.

3836
06:13:12,900 --> 06:13:14,500
I hope you aren't too late.

3837
06:13:14,500 --> 06:13:18,100
Oh, those bandits back there.

3838
06:13:18,100 --> 06:13:20,900
Dot, dot, dot.

3839
06:13:25,200 --> 06:13:26,500
Mm-hmm.

3840
06:13:26,500 --> 06:13:29,400
I had the brap lever literally jump scare of me.

3841
06:13:37,400 --> 06:13:40,300
Oh, he really got me there, didn't he?

3842
06:13:40,300 --> 06:13:42,700
Oh, soul gems.

3843
06:13:42,700 --> 06:13:47,400
We love soul gems, soul gems, soul gems, soul gems.

3844
06:13:47,400 --> 06:13:48,900
Oh, wait, is this the thing?

3845
06:13:48,900 --> 06:13:50,100
I'm supposed to watch him.

3846
06:13:50,100 --> 06:13:51,600
Look, there he is.

3847
06:13:51,600 --> 06:13:53,500
Look through the bars.

3848
06:13:53,500 --> 06:13:55,700
I'm trying to, where is he?

3849
06:13:55,700 --> 06:13:59,400
I'm pretty sure he pops out somewhere here.

3850
06:13:59,400 --> 06:14:02,500
And this is a, this is an instance report.

3851
06:14:02,500 --> 06:14:04,600
I've returned to continue watching.

3852
06:14:04,600 --> 06:14:07,500
Where?

3853
06:14:07,500 --> 06:14:09,200
Oh, there he is, there he is.

3854
06:14:09,200 --> 06:14:10,000
That's Mercer.

3855
06:14:10,000 --> 06:14:11,700
Look, I'm crawling over.

3856
06:14:11,700 --> 06:14:14,800
Look at this little cinematic.

3857
06:14:14,800 --> 06:14:16,800
I like how they just expire right now.

3858
06:14:17,300 --> 06:14:27,800
Oh, they didn't even move a sword.

3859
06:14:27,800 --> 06:14:32,000
Eyelash, and we'll be ready for him.

3860
06:14:32,000 --> 06:14:34,200
Man, the FOV is so low.

3861
06:14:34,200 --> 06:14:35,500
Do you get motion sickness?

3862
06:14:35,500 --> 06:14:38,600
No.

3863
06:14:38,600 --> 06:14:41,000
I'm very lucky, Mercy says she gets motion sickness

3864
06:14:41,000 --> 06:14:42,900
playing video games.

3865
06:14:42,900 --> 06:14:45,800
Not to be dramatic, but I think I would end it.

3866
06:14:45,800 --> 06:14:50,800
Oh, God, I think there's a farmer around here.

3867
06:14:50,800 --> 06:14:52,100
What's this?

3868
06:14:52,100 --> 06:14:54,000
Potions.

3869
06:14:54,000 --> 06:14:55,200
Lutions and potions.

3870
06:14:55,200 --> 06:14:58,000
I do love a good, I do love a good collection.

3871
06:14:58,000 --> 06:14:59,500
Isn't there a farmer here?

3872
06:14:59,500 --> 06:15:00,600
No?

3873
06:15:00,600 --> 06:15:02,100
Empty?

3874
06:15:02,100 --> 06:15:03,600
Oh, found him.

3875
06:15:03,600 --> 06:15:05,900
Found him.

3876
06:15:05,900 --> 06:15:08,700
And I have course of poison.

3877
06:15:08,700 --> 06:15:12,500
What does he draw?

3878
06:15:12,500 --> 06:15:14,500
Skibertail, nah, you're good.

3879
06:15:14,500 --> 06:15:18,800
You, I want your soul gems.

3880
06:15:18,800 --> 06:15:21,100
Who am I perishing?

3881
06:15:21,100 --> 06:15:23,600
Why is Mercer such a poofy poofy?

3882
06:15:23,600 --> 06:15:25,100
Oh!

3883
06:15:35,200 --> 06:15:38,900
I just smacked myself into a wall at low health.

3884
06:15:38,900 --> 06:15:40,500
Okay, that'll do.

3885
06:15:40,500 --> 06:15:43,100
I think I'll be okay now.

3886
06:15:43,100 --> 06:15:48,700
That was a jump scare and a half.

3887
06:15:48,700 --> 06:15:50,000
Okay, we're fine.

3888
06:15:50,000 --> 06:15:50,700
We're fine.

3889
06:15:50,700 --> 06:15:51,400
We're fine.

3890
06:15:51,400 --> 06:15:54,900
Actually, it's probably really good that I have that on a panic

3891
06:15:54,900 --> 06:15:58,900
because it gets me away from the enemy really quickly.

3892
06:15:58,900 --> 06:15:59,900
The heck is this?

3893
06:15:59,900 --> 06:16:03,800
Let's just stop.

3894
06:16:03,800 --> 06:16:07,000
Oh, I need to go up.

3895
06:16:07,000 --> 06:16:11,400
Excuse me.

3896
06:16:11,400 --> 06:16:17,000
The freaking blades on the ground took all my eggspear.

3897
06:16:17,000 --> 06:16:22,400
Are we having a troll?

3898
06:16:22,400 --> 06:16:26,600
That's, eh?

3899
06:16:26,600 --> 06:16:29,700
And where's the other lever?

3900
06:16:29,700 --> 06:16:32,900
Excuse me, Brynjolf, you're just smacked me in the...

3901
06:16:32,900 --> 06:16:35,700
That's the other lever there?

3902
06:16:35,700 --> 06:16:38,400
Behind an eggspear?

3903
06:16:38,400 --> 06:16:40,700
That can't be right.

3904
06:16:40,700 --> 06:16:42,700
Surely not.

3905
06:16:42,700 --> 06:16:49,000
But it is.

3906
06:16:49,000 --> 06:16:50,400
That can't be right.

3907
06:16:50,400 --> 06:16:51,600
Don't you have the skeleton key?

3908
06:16:51,600 --> 06:16:57,900
No, we've not done that part.

3909
06:16:57,900 --> 06:17:03,600
But that is it.

3910
06:17:03,600 --> 06:17:06,900
Well, good thing I don't have a smurf it, but what?

3911
06:17:06,900 --> 06:17:07,600
Wait.

3912
06:17:07,600 --> 06:17:11,400
Oh, that's not the lever at all.

3913
06:17:11,400 --> 06:17:16,600
Where the heck's the first lever?

3914
06:17:16,600 --> 06:17:20,300
Is it here?

3915
06:17:20,300 --> 06:17:21,800
Where's the second lever?

3916
06:17:21,800 --> 06:17:26,400
Reveal yourself.

3917
06:17:26,400 --> 06:17:27,800
What?

3918
06:17:27,800 --> 06:17:29,000
Oh, there it is.

3919
06:17:29,000 --> 06:17:31,700
Oh, it's adjacent to the other lever.

3920
06:17:31,700 --> 06:17:33,800
Oh my god.

3921
06:17:33,800 --> 06:17:36,300
Then you can go all the way back again.

3922
06:17:36,300 --> 06:17:38,600
Out my way, out my way, out my way, out my way.

3923
06:17:38,600 --> 06:17:40,000
I'm not that fast.

3924
06:17:40,000 --> 06:17:41,600
I'm not that fast.

3925
06:17:41,600 --> 06:17:43,200
Hold on, hold on, I need to cheat.

3926
06:17:43,200 --> 06:17:44,400
I'm not that fast.

3927
06:17:44,400 --> 06:17:54,000
I was gonna say, putting something behind an eggspear level thing is wild.

3928
06:17:54,000 --> 06:17:54,800
That wasn't it?

3929
06:17:54,800 --> 06:17:57,200
Okay, I was gonna say that has to be it.

3930
06:17:57,200 --> 06:18:00,800
I refuse.

3931
06:18:00,800 --> 06:18:04,400
A little cheeky chess.

3932
06:18:04,400 --> 06:18:11,700
I'm being trolled by this game.

3933
06:18:11,700 --> 06:18:15,500
I'm being trolled.

3934
06:18:15,500 --> 06:18:19,300
I'll destroy that, and then I can get more thingy.

3935
06:18:19,300 --> 06:18:20,500
Are we there yet, bruv?

3936
06:18:20,500 --> 06:18:21,200
I feel the same.

3937
06:18:21,200 --> 06:18:23,600
We've literally not even finished one quest line.

3938
06:18:23,600 --> 06:18:26,300
I'm ready to make another cup of tea.

3939
06:18:26,300 --> 06:18:30,800
All right, you can stealth this area, but I'd rather just go for it.

3940
06:18:30,800 --> 06:18:33,800
I'd rather just go for it.

3941
06:18:33,800 --> 06:18:41,700
Earthquake, cheeky bit of an earthquake.

3942
06:18:41,700 --> 06:18:43,000
By the Pope, who's there?

3943
06:18:43,000 --> 06:18:45,200
Identify yourself.

3944
06:18:45,200 --> 06:18:49,600
There is a chess down below, but I'm not really fast right now.

3945
06:18:49,600 --> 06:18:53,800
I want to finish one quest line.

3946
06:18:53,800 --> 06:18:57,100
One quest line is all I ask.

3947
06:18:57,100 --> 06:18:58,100
Stop it.

3948
06:18:58,100 --> 06:19:01,800
You're so stinky.

3949
06:19:01,800 --> 06:19:02,400
Okay, hold on.

3950
06:19:02,400 --> 06:19:03,200
You got something.

3951
06:19:03,300 --> 06:19:04,500
Shaman's key.

3952
06:19:04,500 --> 06:19:05,000
What was this?

3953
06:19:05,000 --> 06:19:08,000
The shaman's key, dude.

3954
06:19:08,000 --> 06:19:09,500
Oh, is it for that?

3955
06:19:09,500 --> 06:19:09,800
You know what?

3956
06:19:09,800 --> 06:19:12,600
I might be the chest.

3957
06:19:12,600 --> 06:19:13,400
No, it's not.

3958
06:19:13,400 --> 06:19:14,800
Well, I'm not looting it then.

3959
06:19:14,800 --> 06:19:15,800
Go away.

3960
06:19:15,800 --> 06:19:19,100
I don't know what the heck the shaman's key is for.

3961
06:19:19,100 --> 06:19:21,200
Clapham stinky lining, honestly.

3962
06:19:21,200 --> 06:19:22,500
I mean, how do you come back from that?

3963
06:19:22,500 --> 06:19:23,600
Someone calls you stinky.

3964
06:19:23,600 --> 06:19:25,800
You have no way of coming back, truly.

3965
06:19:25,800 --> 06:19:26,600
It's over for you.

3966
06:19:26,600 --> 06:19:28,400
Just admit it.

3967
06:19:28,400 --> 06:19:30,800
There's traps everywhere.

3968
06:19:30,800 --> 06:19:33,800
Isn't there a massive Centaurian coming up?

3969
06:19:33,800 --> 06:19:40,400
My brains just reminded me that there's like a big enemy coming soon.

3970
06:19:40,400 --> 06:19:43,200
What does that say?

3971
06:19:43,200 --> 06:19:45,400
Bruv, the game thinks I can read that?

3972
06:19:45,400 --> 06:19:47,700
Mercer, it's backwards.

3973
06:19:47,700 --> 06:19:52,400
Mercer is on the bottom.

3974
06:19:52,400 --> 06:19:57,100
One, two.

3975
06:19:57,100 --> 06:19:58,400
Why is that backwards?

3976
06:19:58,400 --> 06:20:00,200
I can read Mercer as backwards.

3977
06:20:00,200 --> 06:20:02,600
I don't mind the stinky.

3978
06:20:02,600 --> 06:20:04,400
I don't mind the wise.

3979
06:20:04,400 --> 06:20:05,700
What, an air?

3980
06:20:05,700 --> 06:20:10,200
Why is it backwards?

3981
06:20:10,200 --> 06:20:12,600
I'll take these scrolls because I can sell them for money.

3982
06:20:23,600 --> 06:20:25,800
This is very real.

3983
06:20:26,800 --> 06:20:31,700
Oh, dear.

3984
06:20:31,700 --> 06:20:36,600
Right, can you jump the Centaurian and not me, maybe?

3985
06:20:36,600 --> 06:20:39,600
Oh, goodness, gravy.

3986
06:20:39,600 --> 06:20:42,400
Some of these enemies.

3987
06:20:42,400 --> 06:20:44,800
Am I right, fellas?

3988
06:20:44,800 --> 06:20:48,200
Oh, my fellas.

3989
06:20:48,200 --> 06:20:49,900
Oh.

3990
06:20:49,900 --> 06:20:52,200
Oh, hold on.

3991
06:20:52,200 --> 06:20:56,200
Hold on, right, there you go.

3992
06:20:56,200 --> 06:20:57,300
All right, I should probably go to sleep.

3993
06:20:57,300 --> 06:20:58,200
See you next time.

3994
06:20:58,200 --> 06:20:59,700
Rest well, those who sleep.

3995
06:20:59,700 --> 06:21:02,800
Please don't worry if you do need to go to sleep again.

3996
06:21:02,800 --> 06:21:04,600
Bit of a cheeky endurance stream.

3997
06:21:04,600 --> 06:21:08,200
Mercer is going live in T-minus less than three hours.

3998
06:21:08,200 --> 06:21:14,300
We are going to raid Dinter because my Skyrim escapades got cut short

3999
06:21:14,300 --> 06:21:18,900
due to the fact that, oh, I am moving so fast.

4000
06:21:18,900 --> 06:21:21,700
I am successfully avoiding all the traps laid out.

4001
06:21:21,700 --> 06:21:27,000
Yes, I don't know why achievements aren't popping up.

4002
06:21:27,000 --> 06:21:33,200
I'm literally using Xbox Game Pass right now, so it's kind of the...

4003
06:21:33,200 --> 06:21:39,800
I'm not sure what the dealio is, but I'm quite happy just to play through the...

4004
06:21:39,800 --> 06:21:46,700
Thingamabobber and tomorrow's monetization celebration.

4005
06:21:46,700 --> 06:21:51,800
So I guess I can enjoy like a more relaxed for my boys.

4006
06:21:51,800 --> 06:21:54,800
Oh, come on.

4007
06:21:54,800 --> 06:21:56,900
Oh, come on.

4008
06:21:56,900 --> 06:21:59,500
Get a rest.

4009
06:21:59,500 --> 06:22:00,400
Oh, I'm low health.

4010
06:22:00,400 --> 06:22:01,000
Oh, I'm low health.

4011
06:22:01,000 --> 06:22:02,500
I'm about to get altered by a spider.

4012
06:22:02,500 --> 06:22:04,400
Hold on.

4013
06:22:04,400 --> 06:22:08,100
Okay, there we go.

4014
06:22:08,100 --> 06:22:11,000
Go around to read it.

4015
06:22:11,000 --> 06:22:12,700
Go around it to read it.

4016
06:22:12,700 --> 06:22:15,900
Oh, is there like another room that makes a lot more sense

4017
06:22:15,900 --> 06:22:18,200
if there was like something behind it?

4018
06:22:18,200 --> 06:22:23,300
Me here just ignored it and chose to be confused.

4019
06:22:23,300 --> 06:22:24,200
Oh, give me that.

4020
06:22:24,200 --> 06:22:25,700
Oh, orcishbowl and ice.

4021
06:22:25,700 --> 06:22:27,800
Oh, and alchemy.

4022
06:22:27,800 --> 06:22:32,600
Resurrect and restore my energy.

4023
06:22:32,600 --> 06:22:36,000
Mmm.

4024
06:22:36,000 --> 06:22:40,600
Alchemyxing like a DJ.

4025
06:22:40,600 --> 06:22:43,800
Give me them juicy soul gems.

4026
06:22:43,800 --> 06:22:45,000
That's all I want.

4027
06:22:45,000 --> 06:22:46,100
That's all I crave.

4028
06:22:46,100 --> 06:22:49,800
I just want soul gems.

4029
06:22:49,800 --> 06:22:51,700
Oh, I might get one of you.

4030
06:22:51,700 --> 06:22:53,900
No.

4031
06:22:53,900 --> 06:22:55,400
Okay, okay.

4032
06:22:55,400 --> 06:22:57,300
You guys don't need to perfectly follow me.

4033
06:22:57,300 --> 06:22:58,600
You do realize that, right?

4034
06:22:58,600 --> 06:23:00,900
But we can do this.

4035
06:23:00,900 --> 06:23:08,500
And we completely missed them because we alerted the enemies to our location.

4036
06:23:08,500 --> 06:23:09,800
Okay, there we go.

4037
06:23:09,800 --> 06:23:10,500
Oh, my God, he's beat.

4038
06:23:10,500 --> 06:23:14,300
He jumped in me.

4039
06:23:14,300 --> 06:23:15,300
I'm actually beating that.

4040
06:23:15,300 --> 06:23:16,400
I wasn't beating him.

4041
06:23:16,400 --> 06:23:20,200
God, they have so much venom.

4042
06:23:20,200 --> 06:23:23,900
So much venom.

4043
06:23:23,900 --> 06:23:24,600
Don't mind if I do it.

4044
06:23:24,600 --> 06:23:26,700
What on earth were they doing?

4045
06:23:26,700 --> 06:23:30,200
Sheebie, what have you been doing in your dungeon?

4046
06:23:30,200 --> 06:23:32,000
These last words?

4047
06:23:32,000 --> 06:23:33,100
Oh, my God, that's brutal.

4048
06:23:33,100 --> 06:23:35,300
Hold on.

4049
06:23:35,300 --> 06:23:37,900
These last words.

4050
06:23:37,900 --> 06:23:39,400
Nobody thought they were real,

4051
06:23:39,400 --> 06:23:42,000
but I've seen them in the eyes of the snow elves.

4052
06:23:42,000 --> 06:23:46,800
The dwarves thought they took them from the Thawmer,

4053
06:23:46,800 --> 06:23:48,100
but they themselves were fooled.

4054
06:23:48,100 --> 06:23:50,600
A statue built in secrecy by the slaves.

4055
06:23:50,600 --> 06:23:51,800
The eyes burn into you,

4056
06:23:51,800 --> 06:23:53,700
and I see them even now.

4057
06:23:53,700 --> 06:23:56,200
Sarafa escaped through the collapsing tunnel,

4058
06:23:56,200 --> 06:23:58,000
but he'll never escape what we've seen.

4059
06:23:58,000 --> 06:23:59,300
Men will never believe him,

4060
06:23:59,300 --> 06:24:02,700
and he'll be driven mad by the knowledge that he'll never see them again.

4061
06:24:02,700 --> 06:24:08,600
But I may yet see them again before I die.

4062
06:24:08,600 --> 06:24:11,800
Wow, that was strange.

4063
06:24:11,800 --> 06:24:13,400
Johnny's a soul gem addict.

4064
06:24:13,400 --> 06:24:16,700
Literally, they're like the most OP leveling up system.

4065
06:24:16,700 --> 06:24:18,200
I'm just going to blast through this area

4066
06:24:18,200 --> 06:24:26,700
because there's a massive flamethrower, I think, or something.

4067
06:24:26,700 --> 06:24:29,200
How am I detected if I'm around the corner?

4068
06:24:29,200 --> 06:24:31,100
Why are you going for me?

4069
06:24:31,100 --> 06:24:35,500
He's right there.

4070
06:24:35,500 --> 06:24:37,500
Literally, right.

4071
06:24:37,500 --> 06:24:40,900
Actually, I just remembered Mercer drops are really good.

4072
06:24:40,900 --> 06:24:45,300
Two-handed sword, and we already got children.

4073
06:24:45,300 --> 06:24:49,000
Yeah, that's right. Spank that rat on the fire.

4074
06:24:49,000 --> 06:24:52,600
Oh.

4075
06:24:52,600 --> 06:24:56,500
Oh, let's go.

4076
06:24:56,500 --> 06:24:59,200
Oh, my fellows.

4077
06:24:59,200 --> 06:25:00,300
Oh, I'm getting...

4078
06:25:00,300 --> 06:25:04,700
Yeah, okay. I was the same kind of blasted by this.

4079
06:25:04,700 --> 06:25:10,500
We may yet to see Johnny's eyes before we die.

4080
06:25:10,500 --> 06:25:15,100
I might need to heal.

4081
06:25:15,100 --> 06:25:21,100
Or I might get a wave of thought.

4082
06:25:21,100 --> 06:25:22,300
Ooh, we've been...

4083
06:25:22,300 --> 06:25:23,200
Oh, I got detected.

4084
06:25:23,200 --> 06:25:24,800
I keep going, like, all right.

4085
06:25:24,800 --> 06:25:27,100
I'll finally go sneak, and then I get detected

4086
06:25:27,100 --> 06:25:32,500
because I'm not paying attention.

4087
06:25:32,500 --> 06:25:34,100
Touch this.

4088
06:25:34,100 --> 06:25:36,100
Eat this.

4089
06:25:36,100 --> 06:25:38,400
Fun fact, the Dwemer and Elden Scrolls are not doors,

4090
06:25:38,400 --> 06:25:40,100
but actually, a type of elf.

4091
06:25:40,100 --> 06:25:41,100
Two-handed.

4092
06:25:41,100 --> 06:25:43,100
He isn't a drill wielder.

4093
06:25:43,100 --> 06:25:44,900
Exactly.

4094
06:25:44,900 --> 06:25:46,400
Imagine not being a drill wielder.

4095
06:25:46,400 --> 06:25:49,300
I can't relate.

4096
06:25:49,300 --> 06:25:51,700
I've tried so many times to be an archer,

4097
06:25:51,700 --> 06:25:53,800
but I just can't do it.

4098
06:25:53,800 --> 06:25:56,300
Like, especially when the enemy come up in your face

4099
06:25:56,300 --> 06:25:57,700
and you've got a bow and arrow,

4100
06:25:57,700 --> 06:26:02,400
it's like, bro, wouldn't actually be so furofuro.

4101
06:26:03,000 --> 06:26:07,500
I think that actually does more damage to the mother.

4102
06:26:07,500 --> 06:26:10,800
Wait, can I get them to deal with the enemies?

4103
06:26:10,800 --> 06:26:13,100
Oh, my God, that's so cool.

4104
06:26:13,100 --> 06:26:15,600
I can, like, go through here.

4105
06:26:15,600 --> 06:26:19,400
Is there, like, a treasure chest or something?

4106
06:26:19,400 --> 06:26:22,400
Or is this just, like, a hurry up?

4107
06:26:22,400 --> 06:26:24,800
Oh, wait, that symbol.

4108
06:26:24,800 --> 06:26:26,700
That means there's loot here?

4109
06:26:26,700 --> 06:26:29,200
I don't see no loot.

4110
06:26:29,200 --> 06:26:33,000
Or does it just mean that the thieves' guild was here?

4111
06:26:36,200 --> 06:26:38,100
Huh?

4112
06:26:38,100 --> 06:26:40,900
I'm so confused.

4113
06:26:40,900 --> 06:26:43,700
I feel like there may have been something I missed,

4114
06:26:43,700 --> 06:26:45,500
but hey-ho.

4115
06:26:47,200 --> 06:26:48,100
All right, let's get to it.

4116
06:26:48,100 --> 06:26:49,100
Everybody get to it.

4117
06:26:49,100 --> 06:26:50,100
To it.

4118
06:26:50,100 --> 06:26:51,100
Let's get this part.

4119
06:26:51,100 --> 06:26:52,100
It started.

4120
06:26:52,100 --> 06:26:54,500
Let's get the foam.

4121
06:26:54,500 --> 06:26:56,600
Departed.

4122
06:26:56,600 --> 06:26:58,000
Mercer was here.

4123
06:26:58,000 --> 06:26:59,800
Shield one-handed is perfectly viable.

4124
06:26:59,800 --> 06:27:00,600
Thank you very much.

4125
06:27:00,600 --> 06:27:02,900
Probably.

4126
06:27:02,900 --> 06:27:03,500
What do they hold?

4127
06:27:03,500 --> 06:27:06,700
So they just kind of hold a lot of, like, mix and stuff.

4128
06:27:06,700 --> 06:27:07,600
That's interesting.

4129
06:27:07,600 --> 06:27:12,000
I guess a few were more into, like, the alchemy side of things.

4130
06:27:12,000 --> 06:27:13,100
Oh, master a lot.

4131
06:27:13,100 --> 06:27:15,700
Right, I'm not bothering.

4132
06:27:15,700 --> 06:27:16,800
Saw his bot on your bike.

4133
06:27:16,800 --> 06:27:18,100
Mm-hmm.

4134
06:27:20,500 --> 06:27:22,100
Hydration check.

4135
06:27:28,600 --> 06:27:29,900
Oh.

4136
06:27:36,500 --> 06:27:38,000
Wow!

4137
06:27:47,100 --> 06:27:48,900
Such a ship.

4138
06:27:51,900 --> 06:27:52,800
Mm-hmm.

4139
06:27:52,800 --> 06:27:55,100
Yeah, give me the key, Mercer.

4140
06:27:59,000 --> 06:28:03,000
The water's rising.

4141
06:28:12,000 --> 06:28:13,500
Uh...

4142
06:28:15,500 --> 06:28:16,600
I don't believe you, no.

4143
06:28:16,600 --> 06:28:18,000
Turtle gates me.

4144
06:28:18,000 --> 06:28:20,000
My new friend leaking.

4145
06:28:29,000 --> 06:28:31,300
Both of us lie, cheat, and steal.

4146
06:28:31,300 --> 06:28:32,800
Oh!

4147
06:28:32,800 --> 06:28:34,000
Dun, dun, dun.

4148
06:28:34,000 --> 06:28:38,000
The difference is, I still have honor.

4149
06:28:50,400 --> 06:28:54,800
If anyone falls, it'll be you, Mercer.

4150
06:28:59,000 --> 06:29:02,000
Nightingale.

4151
06:29:04,000 --> 06:29:09,000
Uh, I can't remember if this is hard or not.

4152
06:29:09,000 --> 06:29:11,000
Oh, no, he got wallets.

4153
06:29:11,000 --> 06:29:13,000
Oh, he's got blood drain.

4154
06:29:15,000 --> 06:29:17,000
Oh, my God.

4155
06:29:20,000 --> 06:29:21,000
Oh, where is he?

4156
06:29:21,000 --> 06:29:22,000
I can just see the red doll.

4157
06:29:22,000 --> 06:29:24,000
I'm chasing the red doll.

4158
06:29:24,000 --> 06:29:25,000
I'm not even...

4159
06:29:25,000 --> 06:29:26,000
There he is!

4160
06:29:26,000 --> 06:29:27,000
I found him!

4161
06:29:28,000 --> 06:29:29,000
Hello!

4162
06:29:29,000 --> 06:29:30,000
Hello!

4163
06:29:30,000 --> 06:29:32,000
I got him.

4164
06:29:32,000 --> 06:29:33,000
He's got...

4165
06:29:33,000 --> 06:29:34,000
Whoa, he's got like...

4166
06:29:34,000 --> 06:29:35,000
Yeah, I'll take all that.

4167
06:29:35,000 --> 06:29:37,000
Shit, give me everything.

4168
06:29:37,000 --> 06:29:40,000
Oh, I'm carrying too much to be able to run.

4169
06:29:40,000 --> 06:29:41,000
Uh...

4170
06:29:41,000 --> 06:29:43,000
Oh, sorry, hold on.

4171
06:29:43,000 --> 06:29:44,000
Sorry, excuse me.

4172
06:29:44,000 --> 06:29:47,000
Just need to drop a few things that I don't need.

4173
06:29:47,000 --> 06:29:49,000
I don't need an embalming tool.

4174
06:29:49,000 --> 06:29:51,000
I can show you that much.

4175
06:29:51,000 --> 06:29:54,000
Uh, don't need random chunks of ore.

4176
06:29:54,000 --> 06:29:55,000
That's fine.

4177
06:29:56,000 --> 06:29:57,000
A wall?

4178
06:29:57,000 --> 06:29:58,000
It looks like a ship.

4179
06:29:58,000 --> 06:30:00,000
Is that a tap?

4180
06:30:01,000 --> 06:30:04,000
Yeah, don't need all these random miscellaneous things.

4181
06:30:04,000 --> 06:30:05,000
That's fine.

4182
06:30:05,000 --> 06:30:08,000
Ingredients that could probably eat all the little ones

4183
06:30:08,000 --> 06:30:12,000
and clear up some side space stuff, I guess?

4184
06:30:13,000 --> 06:30:15,000
Unknown, unknown.

4185
06:30:15,000 --> 06:30:16,000
Sorry, guys.

4186
06:30:16,000 --> 06:30:18,000
I know the cave is collapsing.

4187
06:30:18,000 --> 06:30:20,000
It's very important I have a little taste test

4188
06:30:20,000 --> 06:30:21,000
of all these ingredients.

4189
06:30:21,000 --> 06:30:22,000
I assure you.

4190
06:30:22,000 --> 06:30:23,000
Food?

4191
06:30:23,000 --> 06:30:24,000
Yeah, sure.

4192
06:30:24,000 --> 06:30:26,000
I'm just freaking loaded up.

4193
06:30:26,000 --> 06:30:28,000
Am I light yet?

4194
06:30:28,000 --> 06:30:29,000
No, I'm not light yet.

4195
06:30:29,000 --> 06:30:30,000
Holy crap.

4196
06:30:30,000 --> 06:30:31,000
Okay, uh, right.

4197
06:30:31,000 --> 06:30:34,000
What do we not need?

4198
06:30:34,000 --> 06:30:36,000
That does say 26, not gonna lie.

4199
06:30:36,000 --> 06:30:39,000
Oh, I forgot to...

4200
06:30:39,000 --> 06:30:41,000
That one's better.

4201
06:30:41,000 --> 06:30:43,000
I don't want to, like, drop it, though.

4202
06:30:43,000 --> 06:30:47,000
I feel like I can sell it for, like, decent money, honestly.

4203
06:30:47,000 --> 06:30:49,000
Um...

4204
06:30:49,000 --> 06:30:52,000
I guess we'll just drop that shit.

4205
06:30:52,000 --> 06:30:55,000
Orcishbowl, 11, playing...

4206
06:30:55,000 --> 06:30:57,000
These don't really give me much money.

4207
06:30:58,000 --> 06:30:59,000
Okay.

4208
06:30:59,000 --> 06:31:00,000
So don't panic.

4209
06:31:00,000 --> 06:31:03,000
I know the cave is literally...

4210
06:31:03,000 --> 06:31:04,000
Why is it...

4211
06:31:04,000 --> 06:31:07,000
Oh, I know the cave is, like, perishing

4212
06:31:07,000 --> 06:31:09,000
and it's falling with war.

4213
06:31:09,000 --> 06:31:10,000
But don't panic, guys.

4214
06:31:10,000 --> 06:31:12,000
Everything is okay, alright?

4215
06:31:12,000 --> 06:31:14,000
You just have to let it fill.

4216
06:31:14,000 --> 06:31:15,000
Oh.

4217
06:31:15,000 --> 06:31:16,000
Oh, he...

4218
06:31:16,000 --> 06:31:18,000
Oh, he hit the quad.

4219
06:31:18,000 --> 06:31:19,000
The quad.

4220
06:31:19,000 --> 06:31:20,000
Oh, are you guys okay?

4221
06:31:20,000 --> 06:31:21,000
Do you guys need to breathe?

4222
06:31:21,000 --> 06:31:22,000
No?

4223
06:31:22,000 --> 06:31:23,000
No, you don't need to breathe?

4224
06:31:23,000 --> 06:31:24,000
Okay.

4225
06:31:24,000 --> 06:31:25,000
You don't have to.

4226
06:31:25,000 --> 06:31:30,000
If you look above the head of the elf,

4227
06:31:30,000 --> 06:31:36,000
you'll notice those rocks look very suspiciously movable.

4228
06:31:36,000 --> 06:31:37,000
That's because they are.

4229
06:31:37,000 --> 06:31:38,000
You have a keen eye.

4230
06:31:38,000 --> 06:31:40,000
Refling, you have a keen eye.

4231
06:31:42,000 --> 06:31:47,000
Strongly to taste test all the new alchemy ingredients.

4232
06:31:47,000 --> 06:31:49,000
Literally, like, trying to, like, release.

4233
06:31:49,000 --> 06:31:51,000
Some of the weight in my inventory.

4234
06:31:51,000 --> 06:31:53,000
And I'm like, hmm, yes, hmm.

4235
06:31:53,000 --> 06:31:55,000
This moth wing is the whole...

4236
06:31:55,000 --> 06:31:57,000
What a delicacy.

4237
06:31:57,000 --> 06:31:59,000
You just have to wait.

4238
06:31:59,000 --> 06:32:01,000
Unfortunately, you can't, like, swim upwards.

4239
06:32:01,000 --> 06:32:04,000
It doesn't do it the way you want it to.

4240
06:32:04,000 --> 06:32:06,000
So it's a bit awkward.

4241
06:32:06,000 --> 06:32:08,000
But yeah.

4242
06:32:08,000 --> 06:32:11,000
I remember the first place where I was trying to, like,

4243
06:32:11,000 --> 06:32:12,000
swim through these pipes.

4244
06:32:12,000 --> 06:32:16,000
I was like, yes, the pipes, the pipes will save me.

4245
06:32:16,000 --> 06:32:20,000
But it should do one big collapse.

4246
06:32:20,000 --> 06:32:22,000
There you go.

4247
06:32:22,000 --> 06:32:25,000
Take it long enough, honestly.

4248
06:32:25,000 --> 06:32:31,000
And then you just gotta wait until it gets high enough to get up there.

4249
06:32:31,000 --> 06:32:35,000
To shift the weight in my body eats 50 cheese wheels.

4250
06:32:35,000 --> 06:32:36,000
We are aquatic.

4251
06:32:36,000 --> 06:32:38,000
Let me eat some too.

4252
06:32:38,000 --> 06:32:41,000
Stopping to release, yes, there.

4253
06:32:41,000 --> 06:32:42,000
Hmm.

4254
06:32:42,000 --> 06:32:44,000
But it's faster you get out of that cave

4255
06:32:44,000 --> 06:32:46,000
the easier the game.

4256
06:32:50,000 --> 06:32:51,000
Briff.

4257
06:32:51,000 --> 06:32:52,000
Briff.

4258
06:32:52,000 --> 06:32:55,000
I have completely forgotten how much the NPCs

4259
06:32:55,000 --> 06:32:58,000
love to talk to you.

4260
06:32:58,000 --> 06:33:00,000
Five, eight, nine.

4261
06:33:02,000 --> 06:33:03,000
No!

4262
06:33:03,000 --> 06:33:05,000
Carlisle!

4263
06:33:09,000 --> 06:33:11,000
It's not simple.

4264
06:33:15,000 --> 06:33:16,000
Sepucar.

4265
06:33:16,000 --> 06:33:18,000
I've never said sepucar.

4266
06:33:21,000 --> 06:33:24,000
Are you ready to take a pilgrimage together?

4267
06:33:34,000 --> 06:33:37,000
Then we'd best get started.

4268
06:33:44,000 --> 06:33:46,000
You need to protect the king.

4269
06:33:46,000 --> 06:33:49,000
I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your journey alone.

4270
06:33:52,000 --> 06:33:53,000
Take this with you.

4271
06:33:53,000 --> 06:33:56,000
I'm not certain if it will help within the walls of the sepucar.

4272
06:33:56,000 --> 06:33:58,000
I've had this for the most time.

4273
06:33:59,000 --> 06:34:01,000
And I haven't let me down.

4274
06:34:01,000 --> 06:34:03,000
I hope it brings you the same path.

4275
06:34:14,000 --> 06:34:16,000
I'll literally yank the HP off him.

4276
06:34:17,000 --> 06:34:20,000
Can we serve Strony in other ways?

4277
06:34:20,000 --> 06:34:21,000
Absolutely.

4278
06:34:23,000 --> 06:34:26,000
It depends what your offering is to me.

4279
06:34:28,000 --> 06:34:31,000
Aw, I've not even been a folk wreath yet!

4280
06:34:34,000 --> 06:34:36,000
Actually, you know what?

4281
06:34:36,000 --> 06:34:40,000
I need to destroy and enchant a few things to sell on.

4282
06:34:40,000 --> 06:34:43,000
So I'm gonna go do that now and it will free up a lot of inventory.

4283
06:34:44,000 --> 06:34:46,000
Is Carlaya the same VA as Shadowheart?

4284
06:34:46,000 --> 06:34:47,000
I cannot tell you that.

4285
06:34:47,000 --> 06:34:48,000
I don't know.

4286
06:34:49,000 --> 06:34:51,000
Baldur's Gate is such a good review, though,

4287
06:34:51,000 --> 06:34:54,000
that I'm really tempted to play it for the first time on stream.

4288
06:34:55,000 --> 06:34:58,000
I'm worried in case I'm so dumb I can't figure it out,

4289
06:34:58,000 --> 06:35:00,000
but hopefully it's a full-proof game.

4290
06:35:00,000 --> 06:35:02,000
Anyone can just jump in on the fun.

4291
06:35:02,000 --> 06:35:04,000
This is what I want.

4292
06:35:05,000 --> 06:35:08,000
Devouring, archery, and potions.

4293
06:35:08,000 --> 06:35:10,000
Everything else can be sold.

4294
06:35:10,000 --> 06:35:12,000
You heard it here first.

4295
06:35:15,000 --> 06:35:17,000
Did I even have a big gem?

4296
06:35:18,000 --> 06:35:19,000
I do!

4297
06:35:20,000 --> 06:35:21,000
Yes!

4298
06:35:22,000 --> 06:35:23,000
Did I make it craft?

4299
06:35:23,000 --> 06:35:24,000
Yes!

4300
06:35:25,000 --> 06:35:27,000
That was bloody good shoo.

4301
06:35:27,000 --> 06:35:29,000
That bloody good shoo.

4302
06:35:29,000 --> 06:35:30,000
Right, where's that?

4303
06:35:30,000 --> 06:35:31,000
Okay.

4304
06:35:32,000 --> 06:35:36,000
So what? Just enchant random stuff now for the XP, I guess?

4305
06:35:37,000 --> 06:35:38,000
Turn Undead.

4306
06:35:38,000 --> 06:35:40,000
Frost Damage, here, why not?

4307
06:35:40,000 --> 06:35:41,000
Petty Soul Gem.

4308
06:35:41,000 --> 06:35:44,000
Yeah, I'm just going to put Petty Soul Gem stuff on it.

4309
06:35:47,000 --> 06:35:51,000
And then I know I can sell everything in my inventory.

4310
06:35:51,000 --> 06:35:54,000
God, look at the level up is so fast.

4311
06:35:55,000 --> 06:35:57,000
This game is so forgiving.

4312
06:36:02,000 --> 06:36:03,000
Just the noise.

4313
06:36:05,000 --> 06:36:07,000
It's just constantly like...

4314
06:36:08,000 --> 06:36:11,000
We'll put all of this stuff on.

4315
06:36:11,000 --> 06:36:13,000
And then we can get a pretty penny.

4316
06:36:13,000 --> 06:36:15,000
Oh, we might be able to buy the home.

4317
06:36:15,000 --> 06:36:18,000
We might be able to buy our home in Riften.

4318
06:36:19,000 --> 06:36:23,000
And then we can have our little flower garden out in front.

4319
06:36:24,000 --> 06:36:26,000
We can't get chickens though.

4320
06:36:26,000 --> 06:36:27,000
Not yet.

4321
06:36:27,000 --> 06:36:30,000
Baldur's Gate 3 is good and you can do whatever you want.

4322
06:36:30,000 --> 06:36:32,000
It's not really wrong way of playing it.

4323
06:36:32,000 --> 06:36:34,000
Baldur's Gate is really open and rewarding.

4324
06:36:34,000 --> 06:36:35,000
I'm glad.

4325
06:36:38,000 --> 06:36:39,000
Um...

4326
06:36:42,000 --> 06:36:43,000
I can't figure it out.

4327
06:36:43,000 --> 06:36:46,000
Also, it tells us, please backseat me.

4328
06:36:46,000 --> 06:36:47,000
You'll be fine.

4329
06:36:48,000 --> 06:36:52,000
Yeah, some folk really are so strongly like a little bit backseat gaming.

4330
06:36:52,000 --> 06:36:56,000
I'm actually going to travel to Riften just to sell some stuff

4331
06:36:56,000 --> 06:36:58,000
because my inventory is getting a bit too full.

4332
06:36:59,000 --> 06:37:04,000
Now, as much as I like being full and, you know, a bandaid slapped on top.

4333
06:37:04,000 --> 06:37:05,000
Not like this.

4334
06:37:05,000 --> 06:37:06,000
What is this?

4335
06:37:11,000 --> 06:37:12,000
You!

4336
06:37:14,000 --> 06:37:18,000
I would like to sell some weapons that are very heavy.

4337
06:37:21,000 --> 06:37:22,000
I will keep children.

4338
06:37:22,000 --> 06:37:24,000
I'll put it elsewhere.

4339
06:37:28,000 --> 06:37:30,000
I don't want to sell that stuff.

4340
06:37:30,000 --> 06:37:33,000
I'd rather keep it in the prowl.

4341
06:37:33,000 --> 06:37:36,000
I can sell, like, all of it right here at Money's.

4342
06:37:39,000 --> 06:37:40,000
I will remember that.

4343
06:37:43,000 --> 06:37:45,000
You can marry the butcher.

4344
06:37:45,000 --> 06:37:46,000
He's not butcher.

4345
06:37:46,000 --> 06:37:48,000
He's a blacksmith making all that.

4346
06:37:48,000 --> 06:37:50,000
Those wires are really crossed on me.

4347
06:37:50,000 --> 06:37:51,000
Please take...

4348
06:37:53,000 --> 06:37:56,000
Please take some of my stuff that I don't need.

4349
06:37:57,000 --> 06:37:58,000
Thanks. Appreciate it.

4350
06:37:59,000 --> 06:38:02,000
Created potions are 1% more per...

4351
06:38:02,000 --> 06:38:06,000
Wait, no, actually, I'm going to keep the diamonds and stuff on me.

4352
06:38:06,000 --> 06:38:10,000
The reason for that is because you can get, like,

4353
06:38:10,000 --> 06:38:12,000
Miscellaneous Quest to ask for that basic stuff.

4354
06:38:12,000 --> 06:38:13,000
How about you?

4355
06:38:16,000 --> 06:38:18,000
Everything I've got on display, really.

4356
06:38:19,000 --> 06:38:20,000
We're going to get rid of all this.

4357
06:38:20,000 --> 06:38:22,000
This should really lighten the load.

4358
06:38:24,000 --> 06:38:26,000
I don't want to sell that thing.

4359
06:38:26,000 --> 06:38:29,000
Oh, I completely forgot I had, like, all those...

4360
06:38:32,000 --> 06:38:33,000
That must...

4361
06:38:33,000 --> 06:38:35,000
Oh, he's not going to go left.

4362
06:38:35,000 --> 06:38:36,000
Oops.

4363
06:38:36,000 --> 06:38:37,000
Oops, I'm giving away things for free.

4364
06:38:37,000 --> 06:38:38,000
Oopsies.

4365
06:38:38,000 --> 06:38:39,000
Oopsies.

4366
06:38:39,000 --> 06:38:40,000
Teehee.

4367
06:38:40,000 --> 06:38:41,000
Little teehee moment.

4368
06:38:41,000 --> 06:38:44,000
Right, we'll go Falkreath and then we'll hit up Twilight's...

4369
06:38:44,000 --> 06:38:45,000
La-la-la-la-la.

4370
06:38:46,000 --> 06:38:48,000
Strangely, I will remember everything you said.

4371
06:38:48,000 --> 06:38:49,000
Bear, no.

4372
06:38:49,000 --> 06:38:51,000
I even don't want to say half the time.

4373
06:38:51,000 --> 06:38:52,000
I'm just here for a good time.

4374
06:38:52,000 --> 06:38:55,000
Do you remember when we almost got our head chopped off?

4375
06:38:55,000 --> 06:38:58,000
Yeah, and I was taken over by bandits and burnt to a crisp.

4376
06:38:58,000 --> 06:38:59,000
Teehee, not my problem.

4377
06:38:59,000 --> 06:39:00,000
Teehee.

4378
06:39:02,000 --> 06:39:07,000
Strangely, Ever dropped a bunch of jewelry in the shopping centre in Riften.

4379
06:39:07,000 --> 06:39:10,000
Everyone starts fighting over stuff you drop,

4380
06:39:10,000 --> 06:39:13,000
and, like, it literally terminates NPCs,

4381
06:39:13,000 --> 06:39:14,000
and it's, like, the proof.

4382
06:39:14,000 --> 06:39:16,000
I've need them for quests.

4383
06:39:16,000 --> 06:39:20,000
That's the one thing I could absolutely obliterate Skyrim for,

4384
06:39:20,000 --> 06:39:24,000
is if a quest requires an NPC,

4385
06:39:24,000 --> 06:39:27,000
do not let them be perishable.

4386
06:39:27,000 --> 06:39:29,000
Do not let them expire.

4387
06:39:29,000 --> 06:39:31,000
I am so sad.

4388
06:39:31,000 --> 06:39:33,000
What the heck is...

4389
06:39:33,000 --> 06:39:36,000
Oh, no!

4390
06:39:38,000 --> 06:39:41,000
The wolves jump these poor people,

4391
06:39:41,000 --> 06:39:44,000
and the one wolf perished them both.

4392
06:39:48,000 --> 06:39:51,000
That's what you get for trying to execute an innocent dragonborn.

4393
06:39:52,000 --> 06:39:54,000
Some of them are marchers.

4394
06:39:54,000 --> 06:39:57,000
Yeah, like, some NPCs can't be perishable,

4395
06:39:57,000 --> 06:39:59,000
but if they have a quest,

4396
06:39:59,000 --> 06:40:01,000
I feel like they shouldn't be able to expire at all,

4397
06:40:01,000 --> 06:40:04,000
because it's so annoying when you're, like, trying to do it,

4398
06:40:04,000 --> 06:40:06,000
and then it's, like, all surprised, by the way.

4399
06:40:06,000 --> 06:40:07,000
Oh, who are you?

4400
06:40:07,000 --> 06:40:08,000
Hello.

4401
06:40:13,000 --> 06:40:15,000
Mummy, Goo Goo Gaga Azura.

4402
06:40:16,000 --> 06:40:17,000
Mummy.

4403
06:40:17,000 --> 06:40:19,000
Any mummies.

4404
06:40:20,000 --> 06:40:22,000
We'll make it a little tea break.

4405
06:40:22,000 --> 06:40:23,000
A little tea break?

4406
06:40:23,000 --> 06:40:24,000
Is that allowed?

4407
06:40:24,000 --> 06:40:26,000
Is that permitted?

4408
06:40:28,000 --> 06:40:32,000
And then I'm going to get a wee snack as well.

4409
06:40:34,000 --> 06:40:37,000
A bit of a little cup of tea, a little bit of water.

4410
06:40:39,000 --> 06:40:44,000
Yeah, I'm starting to think we're getting, like, absolutely nothing done.

4411
06:40:44,000 --> 06:40:47,000
We're pretty much looking at T-minus two hours.

4412
06:40:47,000 --> 06:40:49,000
I've been live for almost seven hours.

4413
06:40:49,000 --> 06:40:51,000
I've yet to finish the quest.

4414
06:40:52,000 --> 06:40:54,000
Right, fault creases here.

4415
06:40:56,000 --> 06:40:58,000
What the heck is that?

4416
06:41:00,000 --> 06:41:03,000
Bro, you cannot drop rocks on people's heads.

4417
06:41:03,000 --> 06:41:06,000
I cannot tell you how inappropriate that is.

4418
06:41:09,000 --> 06:41:12,000
I am home with my mummy.

4419
06:41:12,000 --> 06:41:15,000
We drink milk and tea up in this place, of course.

4420
06:41:18,000 --> 06:41:21,000
Literally, how have I been at this for seven hours?

4421
06:41:21,000 --> 06:41:22,000
I'm not completed one quest.

4422
06:41:22,000 --> 06:41:23,000
Something's not adding up.

4423
06:41:23,000 --> 06:41:24,000
I don't know.

4424
06:41:24,000 --> 06:41:29,000
Like, I'm pretty sure the Skyrim World record is, like, two hours.

4425
06:41:29,000 --> 06:41:32,000
Like, one hour and 52 minutes or something.

4426
06:41:32,000 --> 06:41:33,000
Ridiculous like that.

4427
06:41:33,000 --> 06:41:40,000
And you're telling me in seven hours, near seven hours, I couldn't finish one quest line.

4428
06:41:42,000 --> 06:41:43,000
Well, I need sleep.

4429
06:41:43,000 --> 06:41:44,000
Good night.

4430
06:41:44,000 --> 06:41:45,000
Thank you for hanging.

4431
06:41:45,000 --> 06:41:46,000
No promises.

4432
06:41:46,000 --> 06:41:47,000
I won't see you in my dreams.

4433
06:41:47,000 --> 06:41:48,000
That's right.

4434
06:41:48,000 --> 06:41:49,000
Get Scottish.

4435
06:41:49,000 --> 06:41:50,000
Get Scottish.

4436
06:41:50,000 --> 06:41:51,000
Get Scottish.

4437
06:41:51,000 --> 06:41:54,000
Your only dream of a Scottish.

4438
06:41:54,000 --> 06:41:56,000
The Highland Cows call you.

4439
06:41:59,000 --> 06:42:02,000
Ooh, I don't want to walk over a grave.

4440
06:42:02,000 --> 06:42:04,000
That's bad luck.

4441
06:42:04,000 --> 06:42:05,000
There's a lot of graves.

4442
06:42:05,000 --> 06:42:07,000
What's going on in fault grief?

4443
06:42:07,000 --> 06:42:11,000
I feel like that's probably a quest, because that's a lot.

4444
06:42:11,000 --> 06:42:14,000
Scotland, forever.

4445
06:42:16,000 --> 06:42:18,000
A little tricky thing.

4446
06:42:18,000 --> 06:42:19,000
Get Scottish.

4447
06:42:19,000 --> 06:42:20,000
Get Scottish.

4448
06:42:20,000 --> 06:42:21,000
Get Scottish.

4449
06:42:21,000 --> 06:42:22,000
I think I need to do that.

4450
06:42:22,000 --> 06:42:24,000
Someone did that where it was like, get pregnant, get pregnant, get pregnant.

4451
06:42:24,000 --> 06:42:26,000
And it's like, do you didn't see it?

4452
06:42:26,000 --> 06:42:27,000
Like, really intense music.

4453
06:42:27,000 --> 06:42:29,000
I want to do that, but like, get Scottish.

4454
06:42:29,000 --> 06:42:30,000
Get Scottish.

4455
06:42:30,000 --> 06:42:31,000
Get Scottish.

4456
06:42:34,000 --> 06:42:35,000
We're almost there.

4457
06:42:35,000 --> 06:42:36,000
We're almost there.

4458
06:42:36,000 --> 06:42:37,000
We're almost there.

4459
06:42:37,000 --> 06:42:40,000
We're just going to run a little bit longer.

4460
06:42:41,000 --> 06:42:45,000
Oh, there's castles and ruins.

4461
06:42:45,000 --> 06:42:49,000
Did you know you can just straight up buy castles in Scotland?

4462
06:42:49,000 --> 06:42:51,000
Fun fact, you can literally look up them online.

4463
06:42:51,000 --> 06:42:53,000
Just type in Castle for sale in Scotland.

4464
06:42:53,000 --> 06:42:56,000
I'm not even kidding.

4465
06:42:56,000 --> 06:42:59,000
It's pretty intense and cool.

4466
06:42:59,000 --> 06:43:01,000
And you can buy churches.

4467
06:43:01,000 --> 06:43:05,000
It's a lot cheaper to live in a church, an ex-church, by the way.

4468
06:43:05,000 --> 06:43:08,000
You can literally, it's like churches for sale in Scotland.

4469
06:43:08,000 --> 06:43:09,000
Yeah.

4470
06:43:09,000 --> 06:43:10,000
Just have a look.

4471
06:43:10,000 --> 06:43:11,000
It's like way cheaper.

4472
06:43:14,000 --> 06:43:18,000
Shawnee, have you heard of the Scott Wikipedia vandalism story?

4473
06:43:18,000 --> 06:43:19,000
Yes.

4474
06:43:19,000 --> 06:43:21,000
Oh, we should talk about it.

4475
06:43:21,000 --> 06:43:26,000
Like, if you didn't know, so Scots is basically slang.

4476
06:43:26,000 --> 06:43:29,000
And we say things very phonetically.

4477
06:43:29,000 --> 06:43:35,000
And someone, whoa, I didn't realize you were a bandit.

4478
06:43:35,000 --> 06:43:36,000
Sorry.

4479
06:43:36,000 --> 06:43:39,000
Time to go, buddy.

4480
06:43:39,000 --> 06:43:40,000
Okay.

4481
06:43:40,000 --> 06:43:46,000
And someone basically went, oh, I'll just rewrite this in Scots.

4482
06:43:46,000 --> 06:43:49,000
But he, like, wasn't Scottish.

4483
06:43:49,000 --> 06:43:53,000
So he just wrote what he thought, like, Scottish folks said.

4484
06:43:53,000 --> 06:43:55,000
And it was just complete gibberish.

4485
06:43:55,000 --> 06:43:59,000
And he'd been doing it for ages and no one, like, caught him.

4486
06:43:59,000 --> 06:44:01,000
Wasn't that it?

4487
06:44:01,000 --> 06:44:07,000
He said in Zillow, Scotland to find an affordable hoose, honestly.

4488
06:44:07,000 --> 06:44:09,000
It's Gallus.

4489
06:44:09,000 --> 06:44:10,000
Hello.

4490
06:44:10,000 --> 06:44:12,000
Hello, Gallus.

4491
06:44:19,000 --> 06:44:20,000
I visited Edinburgh.

4492
06:44:20,000 --> 06:44:21,000
Let's go.

4493
06:44:21,000 --> 06:44:24,000
I'd ask the same question with you.

4494
06:44:24,000 --> 06:44:26,000
It's really funny.

4495
06:44:26,000 --> 06:44:29,000
Shawnee's going to buy a castle, move the wheel or team into it,

4496
06:44:29,000 --> 06:44:31,000
reference to serve them there.

4497
06:44:31,000 --> 06:44:33,000
But could you imagine, though?

4498
06:44:33,000 --> 06:44:37,000
Like, oh, you know what, you get out of this exchange?

4499
06:44:37,000 --> 06:44:39,000
I servited.

4500
06:44:42,000 --> 06:44:45,000
How are you to blame?

4501
06:44:51,000 --> 06:44:53,000
Where can I say not?

4502
06:44:56,000 --> 06:44:58,000
Wait a minute, you're Gallus.

4503
06:44:59,000 --> 06:45:03,000
I've heard that name in a long, long time.

4504
06:45:03,000 --> 06:45:05,000
How do you know of me?

4505
06:45:05,000 --> 06:45:08,000
I'm best pals with your girlfriend.

4506
06:45:08,000 --> 06:45:09,000
The key.

4507
06:45:09,000 --> 06:45:11,000
You have the skeleton key.

4508
06:45:11,000 --> 06:45:14,000
I never thought I'd see it again.

4509
06:45:14,000 --> 06:45:16,000
How do you say I love you in Scottish?

4510
06:45:16,000 --> 06:45:19,000
It's just I love you.

4511
06:45:19,000 --> 06:45:24,000
Like, I love you, and then I love you.

4512
06:45:24,000 --> 06:45:27,000
It's kind of, like, shoved together in fast.

4513
06:45:27,000 --> 06:45:29,000
He's that adoring fan.

4514
06:45:29,000 --> 06:45:31,000
Is he?

4515
06:45:31,000 --> 06:45:33,000
Biazura, Biazura, Biazura.

4516
06:45:33,000 --> 06:45:34,000
I did this for Nektoro.

4517
06:45:34,000 --> 06:45:36,000
I did this for the owner of the guild.

4518
06:45:42,000 --> 06:45:44,000
Carlaya helped me.

4519
06:45:46,000 --> 06:45:48,000
Yes, your girlfriend's alive.

4520
06:45:54,000 --> 06:45:56,000
Well, then she would have appeared here.

4521
06:45:56,000 --> 06:45:58,000
Then take the key and right all the wrongs.

4522
06:46:04,000 --> 06:46:06,000
When we put the strongens or cult leader,

4523
06:46:06,000 --> 06:46:08,000
we could cut taxes and save money.

4524
06:46:08,000 --> 06:46:09,000
Yay!

4525
06:46:11,000 --> 06:46:13,000
We can be tax exempt together.

4526
06:46:13,000 --> 06:46:14,000
Yippee!

4527
06:46:15,000 --> 06:46:17,000
How can I, how can a spirit die?

4528
06:46:17,000 --> 06:46:19,000
The sepulchre isn't nearly a temple

4529
06:46:19,000 --> 06:46:21,000
or a vault to house the key.

4530
06:46:21,000 --> 06:46:25,000
Within these walls is the ebony.

4531
06:46:25,000 --> 06:46:26,000
The ebony?

4532
06:46:26,000 --> 06:46:28,000
A bit of an ebony.

4533
06:46:30,000 --> 06:46:32,000
When Mercer stole the key,

4534
06:46:32,000 --> 06:46:34,000
that conduit closed,

4535
06:46:34,000 --> 06:46:35,000
severely limiting our...

4536
06:46:35,000 --> 06:46:37,000
Maintaining a historical site

4537
06:46:37,000 --> 06:46:39,000
for tax breaks and profit?

4538
06:46:39,000 --> 06:46:40,000
Yeah!

4539
06:46:40,000 --> 06:46:42,000
And then we run, like, a massive B&B over.

4540
06:46:42,000 --> 06:46:43,000
Oh, my God.

4541
06:46:43,000 --> 06:46:44,000
Oh!

4542
06:46:44,000 --> 06:46:46,000
I'm afraid so.

4543
06:46:46,000 --> 06:46:47,000
I'm weakening.

4544
06:46:47,000 --> 06:46:50,000
And I can feel myself slipping away.

4545
06:46:50,000 --> 06:46:52,000
The years without restoration of my power

4546
06:46:52,000 --> 06:46:54,000
I had taken their toll.

4547
06:46:54,000 --> 06:46:56,000
You really want to mess with the IRS?

4548
06:46:56,000 --> 06:46:58,000
That should be a song.

4549
06:46:58,000 --> 06:47:00,000
You really want to mess with the IRS?

4550
06:47:02,000 --> 06:47:05,000
I fought the law in the law one.

4551
06:47:06,000 --> 06:47:07,000
Ray.

4552
06:47:07,000 --> 06:47:08,000
I will go.

4553
06:47:09,000 --> 06:47:10,000
Good luck, Gallus.

4554
06:47:10,000 --> 06:47:12,000
Even if you don't have to do anything,

4555
06:47:12,000 --> 06:47:13,000
that's okay, I'll do it all.

4556
06:47:13,000 --> 06:47:15,000
I don't mind doing the hard work, right?

4557
06:47:15,000 --> 06:47:16,000
Who needs a bastion?

4558
06:47:17,000 --> 06:47:18,000
Who needs a bastion?

4559
06:47:18,000 --> 06:47:19,000
Who's begging for the pagan?

4560
06:47:19,000 --> 06:47:21,000
Because it's all happening at once.

4561
06:47:21,000 --> 06:47:22,000
Let's go!

4562
06:47:22,000 --> 06:47:23,000
I bet he do.

4563
06:47:23,000 --> 06:47:25,000
Beat him up, beat him up, beat him up!

4564
06:47:25,000 --> 06:47:26,000
Beat him up!

4565
06:47:26,000 --> 06:47:27,000
Ay! Ay! Ay!

4566
06:47:27,000 --> 06:47:28,000
Oh, wow.

4567
06:47:28,000 --> 06:47:30,000
They're actually kind of beef.

4568
06:47:30,000 --> 06:47:32,000
They're actually a bit stronger

4569
06:47:32,000 --> 06:47:33,000
than your average enemy.

4570
06:47:33,000 --> 06:47:34,000
Hold on a minute.

4571
06:47:34,000 --> 06:47:35,000
I don't like that.

4572
06:47:35,000 --> 06:47:36,000
Where's...

4573
06:47:36,000 --> 06:47:37,000
You, come here.

4574
06:47:37,000 --> 06:47:38,000
No.

4575
06:47:38,000 --> 06:47:39,000
I'm stuck on the stairs.

4576
06:47:39,000 --> 06:47:40,000
Hold on.

4577
06:47:41,000 --> 06:47:42,000
I'm stuck on...

4578
06:47:42,000 --> 06:47:43,000
Ow! Ow!

4579
06:47:43,000 --> 06:47:44,000
Stop!

4580
06:47:44,000 --> 06:47:45,000
Swap to weapon, Ray!

4581
06:47:45,000 --> 06:47:46,000
Stop to melee!

4582
06:47:46,000 --> 06:47:47,000
Yes, there you go.

4583
06:47:47,000 --> 06:47:48,000
Okay, there we go.

4584
06:47:49,000 --> 06:47:50,000
Jeez, I lose.

4585
06:47:51,000 --> 06:47:52,000
What is in you?

4586
06:47:53,000 --> 06:47:54,000
Arrows?

4587
06:47:55,000 --> 06:47:56,000
So, Gem!

4588
06:47:57,000 --> 06:47:58,000
Alchemy!

4589
06:48:00,000 --> 06:48:02,000
Totally not secret,

4590
06:48:02,000 --> 06:48:03,000
backtracking.

4591
06:48:04,000 --> 06:48:05,000
I do love Skyrim for that.

4592
06:48:05,000 --> 06:48:06,000
It's quite...

4593
06:48:06,000 --> 06:48:07,000
It's quite rather entertaining.

4594
06:48:08,000 --> 06:48:09,000
Okay, they've got elven arrows

4595
06:48:09,000 --> 06:48:10,000
on their persons,

4596
06:48:10,000 --> 06:48:11,000
which is pretty...

4597
06:48:11,000 --> 06:48:12,000
Ugh.

4598
06:48:15,000 --> 06:48:17,000
Whoa, why are you so scary?

4599
06:48:20,000 --> 06:48:21,000
I'm not gonna lie.

4600
06:48:21,000 --> 06:48:23,000
Like, they're kind of messing me up now.

4601
06:48:24,000 --> 06:48:26,000
Open our own velar colony?

4602
06:48:27,000 --> 06:48:28,000
What?

4603
06:48:28,000 --> 06:48:30,000
In the Scottish countryside with crops

4604
06:48:30,000 --> 06:48:32,000
and feudal lordship for the growth?

4605
06:48:33,000 --> 06:48:34,000
Bruh.

4606
06:48:36,000 --> 06:48:37,000
Look, sometimes a sense of community

4607
06:48:37,000 --> 06:48:38,000
is all you need.

4608
06:48:38,000 --> 06:48:40,000
Wait, I'm to stay in the dark.

4609
06:48:42,000 --> 06:48:44,000
Right, if you stay in the dark,

4610
06:48:44,000 --> 06:48:45,000
your health doesn't get...

4611
06:48:48,000 --> 06:48:50,000
Well, wasn't paying attention to that.

4612
06:48:50,000 --> 06:48:51,000
Was I?

4613
06:48:51,000 --> 06:48:52,000
Clearly, no?

4614
06:48:53,000 --> 06:48:55,000
Uh, yeah, you just need to stay in the dark

4615
06:48:55,000 --> 06:48:56,000
so you don't get hurt in this section.

4616
06:48:56,000 --> 06:48:58,000
It's not really too bad at all.

4617
06:48:58,000 --> 06:49:00,000
I just can't see nothing in it at all.

4618
06:49:01,000 --> 06:49:02,000
Oh!

4619
06:49:02,000 --> 06:49:04,000
It's just a wee bit of poison.

4620
06:49:04,000 --> 06:49:05,000
Just a few darts in my eyeballs.

4621
06:49:05,000 --> 06:49:06,000
It's fine, it's fine.

4622
06:49:06,000 --> 06:49:08,000
I can still see for the most part.

4623
06:49:08,000 --> 06:49:09,000
Hee hee.

4624
06:49:09,000 --> 06:49:11,000
I wish I wore my glasses.

4625
06:49:12,000 --> 06:49:13,000
Ah, we did it!

4626
06:49:13,000 --> 06:49:14,000
Hey!

4627
06:49:14,000 --> 06:49:15,000
Woo!

4628
06:49:15,000 --> 06:49:16,000
Let's go.

4629
06:49:16,000 --> 06:49:17,000
What's this?

4630
06:49:17,000 --> 06:49:18,000
Ah!

4631
06:49:18,000 --> 06:49:20,000
My lady!

4632
06:49:20,000 --> 06:49:21,000
Hello!

4633
06:49:23,000 --> 06:49:24,000
Oh!

4634
06:49:24,000 --> 06:49:26,000
A bandit got all the way here.

4635
06:49:27,000 --> 06:49:28,000
Hello, my lady.

4636
06:49:28,000 --> 06:49:30,000
Please ignore the fact that I'm taking your offering.

4637
06:49:30,000 --> 06:49:32,000
So fragmented, I don't need that.

4638
06:49:33,000 --> 06:49:36,000
Uh, uh, behind here is two chains to pull.

4639
06:49:37,000 --> 06:49:38,000
Gammy!

4640
06:49:40,000 --> 06:49:41,000
Atlas!

4641
06:49:42,000 --> 06:49:43,000
Where's Blossom?

4642
06:49:44,000 --> 06:49:45,000
Where's Gammy?

4643
06:49:45,000 --> 06:49:47,000
That's Gammy, the girl.

4644
06:49:47,000 --> 06:49:49,000
And that's her dad, Atlas.

4645
06:49:49,000 --> 06:49:51,000
And Blossom's her mummy.

4646
06:49:53,000 --> 06:49:54,000
Hmm.

4647
06:49:54,000 --> 06:49:56,000
Is it true if you buy Landon Scott, you become a lord?

4648
06:49:56,000 --> 06:49:58,000
No, that is completely false.

4649
06:49:58,000 --> 06:50:02,000
Um, if you take that in, by the way,

4650
06:50:02,000 --> 06:50:03,000
you'll actually...

4651
06:50:03,000 --> 06:50:04,000
What on earth?

4652
06:50:05,000 --> 06:50:06,000
Um...

4653
06:50:09,000 --> 06:50:10,000
Hello!

4654
06:50:11,000 --> 06:50:12,000
Ow!

4655
06:50:12,000 --> 06:50:14,000
Oh my god, I just got reeled by a log.

4656
06:50:14,000 --> 06:50:16,000
That wasn't really that fun, I'm gonna be honest.

4657
06:50:18,000 --> 06:50:19,000
Right, we did it.

4658
06:50:19,000 --> 06:50:20,000
We did it.

4659
06:50:20,000 --> 06:50:21,000
We're here, we're here.

4660
06:50:21,000 --> 06:50:23,000
Snowberry's waiting on Aces every need.

4661
06:50:23,000 --> 06:50:25,000
Penpal's being picked for a set of me.

4662
06:50:28,000 --> 06:50:31,000
Oh, it's all spooky, it's all spooky and purple.

4663
06:50:32,000 --> 06:50:35,000
Oh, I love the color scheme.

4664
06:50:37,000 --> 06:50:39,000
Oh, I remember this.

4665
06:50:42,000 --> 06:50:44,000
Oh no, I'm stuck.

4666
06:50:46,000 --> 06:50:47,000
I should read his note.

4667
06:50:48,000 --> 06:50:50,000
Anderson's, Andrew's message.

4668
06:50:50,000 --> 06:50:52,000
I can't believe it, I came all this way,

4669
06:50:52,000 --> 06:50:54,000
solved all of those ridiculous riddles,

4670
06:50:54,000 --> 06:50:55,000
just to end up here.

4671
06:50:55,000 --> 06:50:58,000
After I memorized Nystrom's clues,

4672
06:50:58,000 --> 06:51:00,000
he'd collected from Letheus,

4673
06:51:00,000 --> 06:51:01,000
isolate his throat.

4674
06:51:01,000 --> 06:51:02,000
Now I guess the joke's on me,

4675
06:51:02,000 --> 06:51:04,000
because I'm stuck here and I don't see a way out.

4676
06:51:04,000 --> 06:51:06,000
Hope someone comes by soon, I'm getting hungry.

4677
06:51:06,000 --> 06:51:08,000
I don't think he made it, chief.

4678
06:51:08,000 --> 06:51:10,000
I don't think he made it.

4679
06:51:10,000 --> 06:51:11,000
Yeah.

4680
06:51:14,000 --> 06:51:16,000
If only we had some sort of...

4681
06:51:17,000 --> 06:51:18,000
key?

4682
06:51:19,000 --> 06:51:22,000
Some sort of skeleton...

4683
06:51:22,000 --> 06:51:23,000
key?

4684
06:51:24,000 --> 06:51:25,000
Yep.

4685
06:51:28,000 --> 06:51:29,000
Oh.

4686
06:51:39,000 --> 06:51:40,000
Oh, I'm stuck.

4687
06:51:40,000 --> 06:51:41,000
What have we got?

4688
06:51:46,000 --> 06:51:47,000
Oh, yes.

4689
06:51:48,000 --> 06:51:49,000
Gammys!

4690
06:51:49,000 --> 06:51:50,000
Look at all Gammys babies!

4691
06:51:50,000 --> 06:51:52,000
Oh, I'm the wrong way, sorry Hen.

4692
06:51:58,000 --> 06:52:00,000
Tell me that ain't good design.

4693
06:52:02,000 --> 06:52:04,000
Excuse me, will Stylical around?

4694
06:52:06,000 --> 06:52:07,000
Oh, yeah.

4695
06:52:09,000 --> 06:52:10,000
Oh, yeah.

4696
06:52:17,000 --> 06:52:18,000
Oh, yeah.

4697
06:52:29,000 --> 06:52:32,000
Nothing more than the fulfillment of your agreement.

4698
06:52:34,000 --> 06:52:36,000
We must stay focused, Reeflings.

4699
06:52:36,000 --> 06:52:38,000
We must stay focused.

4700
06:52:59,000 --> 06:53:04,000
I wish you to drink deeply from the Evermere mortal.

4701
06:53:04,000 --> 06:53:08,000
Or this is where the agent of Nocturnal is born.

4702
06:53:09,000 --> 06:53:10,000
Drink?

4703
06:53:10,000 --> 06:53:12,000
The oath has been strong.

4704
06:53:12,000 --> 06:53:14,000
The die has been cast.

4705
06:53:14,000 --> 06:53:17,000
And your fate awaits you in the Everglow.

4706
06:53:20,000 --> 06:53:22,000
Bye-bye, Mommy!

4707
06:53:28,000 --> 06:53:30,000
What? Where did you come from?

4708
06:53:30,000 --> 06:53:31,000
Hello?

4709
06:53:32,000 --> 06:53:33,000
Sorry.

4710
06:53:33,000 --> 06:53:34,000
Oh, sorry.

4711
06:53:35,000 --> 06:53:36,000
Oh, sorry.

4712
06:53:36,000 --> 06:53:37,000
Can I talk to you now?

4713
06:53:40,000 --> 06:53:41,000
Yes.

4714
06:53:44,000 --> 06:53:46,000
Uh, please, she sounded indifferent.

4715
06:53:59,000 --> 06:54:02,000
I assure you that she'd been displeased with you.

4716
06:54:02,000 --> 06:54:04,000
We wouldn't be having this conversation.

4717
06:54:06,000 --> 06:54:09,000
What's this about becoming an agent and a Nocturnal?

4718
06:54:14,000 --> 06:54:17,000
The crescent moon represents the agent of shadow.

4719
06:54:17,000 --> 06:54:20,000
The crescent moon, I think, is what we want.

4720
06:54:20,000 --> 06:54:23,000
In the full moon, for the agent of strife.

4721
06:54:24,000 --> 06:54:27,000
This is Nocturnal's role in maintaining balance.

4722
06:54:28,000 --> 06:54:32,000
How is this goddess of stealth when it's clear?

4723
06:54:33,000 --> 06:54:35,000
With the clap of her cheeks,

4724
06:54:35,000 --> 06:54:38,000
we'd alarm the guards on a 500 meter radius.

4725
06:54:40,000 --> 06:54:41,000
It's unfamiliar.

4726
06:54:41,000 --> 06:54:43,000
Her hotness is so powerful.

4727
06:54:48,000 --> 06:54:49,000
And you?

4728
06:54:52,000 --> 06:54:53,000
Aww.

4729
06:54:53,000 --> 06:54:54,000
Aww.

4730
06:54:56,000 --> 06:54:57,000
The beginning of what?

4731
06:55:05,000 --> 06:55:06,000
Wow.

4732
06:55:11,000 --> 06:55:13,000
We're down good at what we do.

4733
06:55:15,000 --> 06:55:16,000
Uh, I think stealth.

4734
06:55:16,000 --> 06:55:18,000
Tell me where the crescent moon.

4735
06:55:18,000 --> 06:55:20,000
Is the most on moonlit nights.

4736
06:55:21,000 --> 06:55:22,000
Yeah, okay.

4737
06:55:22,000 --> 06:55:24,000
Well, you do the agent of...

4738
06:55:25,000 --> 06:55:27,000
Are you a crescent moon?

4739
06:55:27,000 --> 06:55:28,000
You're a full moon.

4740
06:55:29,000 --> 06:55:30,000
And you're a half moon.

4741
06:55:30,000 --> 06:55:31,000
Okay, crescent moon.

4742
06:55:33,000 --> 06:55:34,000
Okay, now what?

4743
06:55:35,000 --> 06:55:37,000
Oh no, Gallus is about to come.

4744
06:55:40,000 --> 06:55:43,000
Ooh, look, it's Gallus and Carnaia.

4745
06:55:44,000 --> 06:55:45,000
They're gonna kiss.

4746
06:55:49,000 --> 06:55:51,000
I was afraid she'd become like the others.

4747
06:55:52,000 --> 06:55:55,000
If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale,

4748
06:55:55,000 --> 06:55:57,000
she and his would have come true.

4749
06:55:58,000 --> 06:56:00,000
She would have lost all hope.

4750
06:56:04,000 --> 06:56:06,000
Nocturnal calls me to the Everglow.

4751
06:56:07,000 --> 06:56:09,000
My contract has been fulfilled.

4752
06:56:11,000 --> 06:56:13,000
Will I ever see you again?

4753
06:56:13,000 --> 06:56:16,000
When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid,

4754
06:56:17,000 --> 06:56:19,000
we'll embrace what's ahead.

4755
06:56:20,000 --> 06:56:22,000
How well, Gallus.

4756
06:56:23,000 --> 06:56:24,000
Eyes open.

4757
06:56:25,000 --> 06:56:26,000
Walk with the shadows.

4758
06:56:26,000 --> 06:56:28,000
I've been 25 years since you've seen each other,

4759
06:56:28,000 --> 06:56:29,000
and this is it.

4760
06:56:29,000 --> 06:56:30,000
This is what they muster.

4761
06:56:31,000 --> 06:56:33,000
Are you alright, Carla?

4762
06:56:33,000 --> 06:56:34,000
Maybe it's just not...

4763
06:56:34,000 --> 06:56:35,000
She doesn't understand.

4764
06:56:37,000 --> 06:56:39,000
Oh, he's going to disappear into the bowl of soup.

4765
06:56:39,000 --> 06:56:40,000
Oh, he's in the bowl of soup, lads.

4766
06:56:41,000 --> 06:56:43,000
Sorry, I'm sure it's really emotional.

4767
06:56:44,000 --> 06:56:45,000
What is it?

4768
06:56:45,000 --> 06:56:47,000
He appeared at Gallus' school in our bowl of soup.

4769
06:56:50,000 --> 06:56:52,000
The spirit becomes one with the Everglow.

4770
06:56:56,000 --> 06:56:57,000
Ah.

4771
06:56:57,000 --> 06:56:58,000
So he's gone.

4772
06:57:02,000 --> 06:57:03,000
Okay.

4773
06:57:06,000 --> 06:57:08,000
You drank the ghost soup, honestly.

4774
06:57:12,000 --> 06:57:14,000
They're a part of the darkness around us.

4775
06:57:15,000 --> 06:57:17,000
When we say, walk with the shadows,

4776
06:57:18,000 --> 06:57:21,000
we are asking those nightingales who have passed on to protect us,

4777
06:57:21,000 --> 06:57:25,000
to believe that they are literally what guides our uncanny luck,

4778
06:57:26,000 --> 06:57:28,000
by placing their hands in ours.

4779
06:57:29,000 --> 06:57:31,000
That's why the Evermere needed to be reopened.

4780
06:57:32,000 --> 06:57:34,000
Without it, there's no way Nocturnal was able to...

4781
06:57:35,000 --> 06:57:37,000
I'm getting it now.

4782
06:57:38,000 --> 06:57:39,000
How will I know if I'm needed here?

4783
06:57:39,000 --> 06:57:41,000
If this place is in danger ever again,

4784
06:57:42,000 --> 06:57:43,000
the shadows will call.

4785
06:57:43,000 --> 06:57:44,000
Okay.

4786
06:57:44,000 --> 06:57:45,000
Where should the need arise?

4787
06:57:45,000 --> 06:57:48,000
A portal connects the Sepulchre and Nightingale Hall.

4788
06:57:48,000 --> 06:57:50,000
Use it whenever you wish.

4789
06:57:51,000 --> 06:57:52,000
Okay.

4790
06:57:54,000 --> 06:57:55,000
Where will you be?

4791
06:57:55,000 --> 06:57:58,000
I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall.

4792
06:57:59,000 --> 06:58:00,000
Since it's your home as well.

4793
06:58:01,000 --> 06:58:03,000
I hope to see you and bring you out there.

4794
06:58:04,000 --> 06:58:07,000
Of course, I may visit some of Skyrim's cities too.

4795
06:58:07,000 --> 06:58:09,000
Quiet things from time to time.

4796
06:58:09,000 --> 06:58:11,000
Can't afford to get rusty now, can we?

4797
06:58:12,000 --> 06:58:14,000
Well, I'm...

4798
06:58:14,000 --> 06:58:15,000
I'm satisfied.

4799
06:58:16,000 --> 06:58:17,000
Yeah, yeah, bye-bye.

4800
06:58:17,000 --> 06:58:18,000
Okay, thank you.

4801
06:58:19,000 --> 06:58:20,000
Thank you, hubby-bee.

4802
06:58:20,000 --> 06:58:22,000
Is this your home now?

4803
06:58:23,000 --> 06:58:24,000
It is!

4804
06:58:24,000 --> 06:58:26,000
Okay, so she just hangs out here now.

4805
06:58:26,000 --> 06:58:27,000
Girl, that's a bit depressive.

4806
06:58:27,000 --> 06:58:29,000
But anyway, that's all for now.

4807
06:58:29,000 --> 06:58:31,000
As long as you're having a good time and all that.

4808
06:58:31,000 --> 06:58:35,000
Thanks for the experience of being in Nightingale.

4809
06:58:36,000 --> 06:58:38,000
Alright, have a good night and good luck.

4810
06:58:38,000 --> 06:58:39,000
Thank you!

4811
06:58:39,000 --> 06:58:42,000
For those of you who need to go rest, please do rest.

4812
06:58:42,000 --> 06:58:44,000
I am literally farting about...

4813
06:58:46,000 --> 06:58:47,000
Cause...

4814
06:58:48,000 --> 06:58:51,000
Mercy is going live in two hours.

4815
06:58:51,000 --> 06:58:54,000
I'm gonna redirect into her and then it means I can...

4816
06:58:55,000 --> 06:58:56,000
Do a little bit of...

4817
06:58:56,000 --> 06:59:00,000
A little bit of preparation for my monetization stream tomorrow.

4818
06:59:00,000 --> 06:59:02,000
I'll need to actually make the thumbnail.

4819
06:59:02,000 --> 06:59:04,000
And you get a picture of my frickin' feet for the thumbnail.

4820
06:59:04,000 --> 06:59:05,000
Omega at low.

4821
06:59:05,000 --> 06:59:06,000
And...

4822
06:59:07,000 --> 06:59:09,000
Oh no, what did I do now?

4823
06:59:11,000 --> 06:59:12,000
Well, we do...

4824
06:59:12,000 --> 06:59:13,000
Night...

4825
06:59:13,000 --> 06:59:16,000
Night mother, night mother, send your child unto me for...

4826
06:59:16,000 --> 06:59:17,000
Oh no, sweet mother.

4827
06:59:17,000 --> 06:59:18,000
I keep saying night mother.

4828
06:59:19,000 --> 06:59:20,000
Apparently...

4829
06:59:21,000 --> 06:59:22,000
It's sweet mother.

4830
06:59:23,000 --> 06:59:26,000
I could've sworn I turned that on.

4831
06:59:26,000 --> 06:59:27,000
Man, there we go.

4832
06:59:27,000 --> 06:59:28,000
Yeah.

4833
06:59:29,000 --> 06:59:32,000
Group brushing, T minus 90 minutes.

4834
06:59:32,000 --> 06:59:33,000
Yes.

4835
06:59:33,000 --> 06:59:34,000
Right.

4836
06:59:34,000 --> 06:59:36,000
I am going to make a cup of tea.

4837
06:59:36,000 --> 06:59:38,000
If we would all like to get something to hydrate.

4838
06:59:38,000 --> 06:59:40,000
Gotta go to Winterhold for that one.

4839
06:59:40,000 --> 06:59:41,000
Yes.

4840
06:59:41,000 --> 06:59:43,000
I'm gonna make a cup of tea.

4841
06:59:44,000 --> 06:59:45,000
And then...

4842
06:59:46,000 --> 06:59:47,000
We will...

4843
06:59:47,000 --> 06:59:50,000
See how far we can get on the dark, brotherhood.

4844
06:59:50,000 --> 06:59:54,000
There's absolutely no way in heck we are getting anywhere close to it.

4845
06:59:57,000 --> 06:59:58,000
But...

4846
06:59:58,000 --> 07:00:00,000
It doesn't mean we can't start it, okay?

4847
07:00:00,000 --> 07:00:03,000
Man, I'll arrive late for tomorrow's stream cause I'll be at work.

4848
07:00:04,000 --> 07:00:06,000
It's a very short stream tomorrow.

4849
07:00:06,000 --> 07:00:09,000
It's not Skyrim part two, just...

4850
07:00:10,000 --> 07:00:14,000
For those of you who may be lurking, there is not a Skyrim part two tomorrow

4851
07:00:14,000 --> 07:00:16,000
cause I've completely messed up the achievements

4852
07:00:16,000 --> 07:00:19,000
and the whole point was to do the achievements.

4853
07:00:20,000 --> 07:00:25,000
And for some reason they're not working even though I am on Xbox Game Pass.

4854
07:00:25,000 --> 07:00:27,000
But we do have plenty of time in the future.

4855
07:00:27,000 --> 07:00:31,000
I will definitely come back to Skyrim once I've fixed whatever's going on.

4856
07:00:31,000 --> 07:00:35,000
Cause honestly, I'm like, should've just played cameo.

4857
07:00:40,000 --> 07:00:43,000
Sorry, we need to break in here so we can go talk to this kid.

4858
07:00:44,000 --> 07:00:48,000
Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me for this soon.

4859
07:00:50,000 --> 07:00:51,000
Very tired.

4860
07:00:51,000 --> 07:00:52,000
Oh no.

4861
07:00:54,000 --> 07:00:57,000
Sweet mother, send your child unto me.

4862
07:01:01,000 --> 07:01:03,000
So you come in.

4863
07:01:08,000 --> 07:01:09,000
Munkah.

4864
07:01:09,000 --> 07:01:10,000
S.

4865
07:01:13,000 --> 07:01:14,000
Are you alright?

4866
07:01:22,000 --> 07:01:23,000
The body?

4867
07:01:23,000 --> 07:01:24,000
She came.

4868
07:01:24,000 --> 07:01:26,000
An assassin from a dark brotherhood.

4869
07:01:29,000 --> 07:01:31,000
Ah yes, the black sacrum.

4870
07:01:31,000 --> 07:01:33,000
A Wang of course.

4871
07:01:33,000 --> 07:01:34,000
So long.

4872
07:01:34,000 --> 07:01:36,000
So very long.

4873
07:01:36,000 --> 07:01:38,000
But now that you're here, you can accept my contract.

4874
07:01:39,000 --> 07:01:40,000
Your contract?

4875
07:01:41,000 --> 07:01:43,000
My mother, she...

4876
07:01:43,000 --> 07:01:44,000
She died.

4877
07:01:44,000 --> 07:01:46,000
I'm all alone now.

4878
07:01:47,000 --> 07:01:51,000
So they sent me to the terrible orphanage in Riften on her hall.

4879
07:01:51,000 --> 07:01:54,000
The headmistress is an evil cruel woman.

4880
07:01:54,000 --> 07:01:56,000
They call her Grelad the kind.

4881
07:01:56,000 --> 07:01:57,000
But she's not kind.

4882
07:01:57,000 --> 07:01:59,000
She's terrible to all of us.

4883
07:02:00,000 --> 07:02:03,000
So I ran away and came home.

4884
07:02:03,000 --> 07:02:05,000
And performed the black sacrament.

4885
07:02:05,000 --> 07:02:06,000
Now we're here.

4886
07:02:06,000 --> 07:02:08,000
And you can kill Grelad the kind.

4887
07:02:11,000 --> 07:02:13,000
Sure, buddy.

4888
07:02:16,000 --> 07:02:18,000
A kiss by the sweet mother.

4889
07:02:18,000 --> 07:02:19,000
What does the book say?

4890
07:02:19,000 --> 07:02:20,000
Hand that book over.

4891
07:02:21,000 --> 07:02:23,000
So you wish to summon the dark brotherhood.

4892
07:02:23,000 --> 07:02:25,000
You wish to see someone dead.

4893
07:02:25,000 --> 07:02:29,000
Pray, child, pray, and let the night mother hear your plea.

4894
07:02:29,000 --> 07:02:34,000
You must perform that most profane of rituals, the black sacrament.

4895
07:02:34,000 --> 07:02:40,000
Create an effigy of the intended victim assembled from actual body parts,

4896
07:02:40,000 --> 07:02:43,000
including a heart, skull, bones, and flesh.

4897
07:02:43,000 --> 07:02:45,000
And circle that effigy with candles.

4898
07:02:45,000 --> 07:02:48,000
The ritual itself must then commence.

4899
07:02:49,000 --> 07:02:52,000
Proceed to stab the effigy repeatedly with a dagger,

4900
07:02:52,000 --> 07:02:57,000
rubbed with the petals of a nightshade plant while whispering this plea.

4901
07:02:57,000 --> 07:03:00,000
Sweet mother, sweet mother, send your child unto me

4902
07:03:00,000 --> 07:03:03,000
for the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear.

4903
07:03:03,000 --> 07:03:09,000
Then wait, child, for the dread father sitheth rewards the patient.

4904
07:03:09,000 --> 07:03:14,000
You will be visited by a representative of the dark brotherhood.

4905
07:03:14,000 --> 07:03:17,000
So begins a contract bound in blood.

4906
07:03:17,000 --> 07:03:19,000
That's actually really cool.

4907
07:03:19,000 --> 07:03:21,000
Oh, I'm quite happy with that.

4908
07:03:21,000 --> 07:03:24,000
I quite like that kind of back behind the scenes,

4909
07:03:24,000 --> 07:03:26,000
not behind the scenes because it's like hidden in a book,

4910
07:03:26,000 --> 07:03:28,000
so it's not behind the scenes.

4911
07:03:28,000 --> 07:03:33,000
But I like seeing how the game like tried to explain it.

4912
07:03:33,000 --> 07:03:34,000
It's quite thingy.

4913
07:03:34,000 --> 07:03:36,000
Where did he find the body part?

4914
07:03:36,000 --> 07:03:38,000
Oh, he tried his best, okay.

4915
07:03:38,000 --> 07:03:41,000
Probably went into the crypt or something like that.

4916
07:03:41,000 --> 07:03:44,000
So this is probably the only instance

4917
07:03:44,000 --> 07:03:48,000
when you can perish someone in front of a whole group of people.

4918
07:03:50,000 --> 07:03:51,000
Sorry, Hen.

4919
07:03:55,000 --> 07:03:58,000
Yeah, you do not get in trouble for doing that.

4920
07:03:58,000 --> 07:03:59,000
And all the kids...

4921
07:04:02,000 --> 07:04:05,000
And they're all like laughing at our own stuff.

4922
07:04:06,000 --> 07:04:07,000
Wait, oh, I've gone the wrong way.

4923
07:04:07,000 --> 07:04:09,000
Sorry, I've gone the wrong way.

4924
07:04:11,000 --> 07:04:12,000
We're saved.

4925
07:04:14,000 --> 07:04:17,000
Yeah, literally one of the only instances

4926
07:04:17,000 --> 07:04:19,000
you can walk in and perish someone

4927
07:04:19,000 --> 07:04:21,000
and then come straight back out again.

4928
07:04:21,000 --> 07:04:23,000
They don't care.

4929
07:04:23,000 --> 07:04:24,000
No one cares.

4930
07:04:24,000 --> 07:04:25,000
The Rift and Guards don't even care.

4931
07:04:25,000 --> 07:04:27,000
They must have known as well.

4932
07:04:27,000 --> 07:04:29,000
Now, the actual nice lady takes over.

4933
07:04:29,000 --> 07:04:30,000
Yay!

4934
07:04:31,000 --> 07:04:34,000
So really, we just did everyone a big ol' favour.

4935
07:04:37,000 --> 07:04:39,000
I was like finding different fun ways.

4936
07:04:39,000 --> 07:04:42,000
Apparently you can cast Friendsly in the Children Parish Gray look.

4937
07:04:42,000 --> 07:04:44,000
I'm not sure if that's true or not.

4938
07:04:46,000 --> 07:04:47,000
Is she...

4939
07:04:47,000 --> 07:04:48,000
You know?

4940
07:04:48,000 --> 07:04:50,000
Like, kinda sounds like Midoriya.

4941
07:05:03,000 --> 07:05:05,000
What did you give me?

4942
07:05:05,000 --> 07:05:06,000
You're a child.

4943
07:05:06,000 --> 07:05:08,000
Completed Innocence Loss.

4944
07:05:09,000 --> 07:05:11,000
Family heirloom?

4945
07:05:11,000 --> 07:05:13,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

4946
07:05:13,000 --> 07:05:14,000
My bad.

4947
07:05:14,000 --> 07:05:15,000
I got a little...

4948
07:05:15,000 --> 07:05:18,000
I just needed to check what your family heirloom was.

4949
07:05:20,000 --> 07:05:21,000
Is there any?

4950
07:05:21,000 --> 07:05:22,000
Oh, there is.

4951
07:05:23,000 --> 07:05:24,000
A plate?

4952
07:05:24,000 --> 07:05:25,000
A plate.

4953
07:05:25,000 --> 07:05:28,000
I mean, you are a child, so I guess that makes sense.

4954
07:05:29,000 --> 07:05:31,000
Now, if I remember correctly,

4955
07:05:31,000 --> 07:05:33,000
we need to go sleep in a bed.

4956
07:05:34,000 --> 07:05:37,000
The first sleep the poor dragonborn has had

4957
07:05:37,000 --> 07:05:39,000
since I started my adventures,

4958
07:05:39,000 --> 07:05:41,000
so we'll just rent a little bed in here.

4959
07:05:43,000 --> 07:05:46,000
You ever just accidentally dash across the house, honestly?

4960
07:05:48,000 --> 07:05:49,000
Oh, you.

4961
07:05:49,000 --> 07:05:50,000
Hello!

4962
07:05:50,000 --> 07:05:51,000
Hello!

4963
07:05:51,000 --> 07:05:53,000
Can you come a bit closer?

4964
07:05:53,000 --> 07:05:54,000
Okay, I guess not.

4965
07:05:55,000 --> 07:05:56,000
Yeah, I'd like to rent a room.

4966
07:05:58,000 --> 07:05:59,000
Thanks, darling.

4967
07:06:00,000 --> 07:06:01,000
Oh, okay.

4968
07:06:01,000 --> 07:06:02,000
Oh, 10...

4969
07:06:02,000 --> 07:06:03,000
10 stars!

4970
07:06:03,000 --> 07:06:04,000
Whoa!

4971
07:06:06,000 --> 07:06:07,000
Hello?

4972
07:06:07,000 --> 07:06:08,000
My lady?

4973
07:06:08,000 --> 07:06:09,000
You want to join me?

4974
07:06:16,000 --> 07:06:17,000
Okay.

4975
07:06:19,000 --> 07:06:21,000
Right, please stop talking to me.

4976
07:06:21,000 --> 07:06:22,000
I'm trying to be sure in my room,

4977
07:06:22,000 --> 07:06:23,000
but I'm having to help the NPC.

4978
07:06:23,000 --> 07:06:24,000
Okay, there we go.

4979
07:06:24,000 --> 07:06:26,000
Thank you for showing me my room.

4980
07:06:27,000 --> 07:06:28,000
If you want the tip,

4981
07:06:28,000 --> 07:06:29,000
just stay in the room, right?

4982
07:06:29,000 --> 07:06:30,000
Get in that bed.

4983
07:06:30,000 --> 07:06:31,000
Don't be ill.

4984
07:06:31,000 --> 07:06:32,000
It's all right.

4985
07:06:33,000 --> 07:06:34,000
Absolutely shocking behavior.

4986
07:06:34,000 --> 07:06:35,000
Please stop.

4987
07:06:35,000 --> 07:06:36,000
12 hours.

4988
07:06:36,000 --> 07:06:38,000
We won't make a cup of tea very shortly.

4989
07:06:38,000 --> 07:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

4990
07:06:39,000 --> 07:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

4991
07:06:40,000 --> 07:06:41,000
I'm getting delirious.

4992
07:06:41,000 --> 07:06:42,000
Miss Johnny,

4993
07:06:42,000 --> 07:06:44,000
can I be excused from the history of the Nordic class

4994
07:06:44,000 --> 07:06:45,000
to use the bathroom?

4995
07:06:45,000 --> 07:06:47,000
Yes, you're allowed to use the toilet.

4996
07:06:47,000 --> 07:06:51,000
Right, I am going to go make a cup of tea.

4997
07:06:55,000 --> 07:06:56,000
What?

4998
07:06:56,000 --> 07:06:58,000
Was that not supposed to be kidnapped?

4999
07:06:58,000 --> 07:07:00,000
After you perish?

5000
07:07:02,000 --> 07:07:04,000
Does it have to be about the island?

5001
07:07:08,000 --> 07:07:09,000
Huh.

5002
07:07:12,000 --> 07:07:14,000
Give her to her, kid.

5003
07:07:14,000 --> 07:07:16,000
It's after you receive a courier's lair.

5004
07:07:16,000 --> 07:07:17,000
Ah!

5005
07:07:17,000 --> 07:07:18,000
How are you streaming now?

5006
07:07:18,000 --> 07:07:20,000
How are you so powerful?

5007
07:07:20,000 --> 07:07:21,000
I'm not sure.

5008
07:07:21,000 --> 07:07:22,000
I don't know.

5009
07:07:22,000 --> 07:07:23,000
I don't know.

5010
07:07:23,000 --> 07:07:24,000
I don't know.

5011
07:07:24,000 --> 07:07:25,000
I don't know.

5012
07:07:25,000 --> 07:07:26,000
I don't know.

5013
07:07:26,000 --> 07:07:27,000
What are you streaming now?

5014
07:07:27,000 --> 07:07:28,000
How are you so powerful?

5015
07:07:28,000 --> 07:07:31,000
That is called autism.

5016
07:07:31,000 --> 07:07:33,000
And I love my games.

5017
07:07:33,000 --> 07:07:35,000
Right, I'm waiting on the courier.

5018
07:07:35,000 --> 07:07:37,000
Courier, courier.

5019
07:07:37,000 --> 07:07:39,000
Courier, courier.

5020
07:07:39,000 --> 07:07:40,000
Give me a letter.

5021
07:07:40,000 --> 07:07:42,000
Courier, my boss.

5022
07:07:42,000 --> 07:07:43,000
Right, ah, sorry.

5023
07:07:43,000 --> 07:07:45,000
I'm going to go get a cup of tea to recalibrate

5024
07:07:45,000 --> 07:07:48,000
because I have been playing for a hot second.

5025
07:07:48,000 --> 07:07:50,000
I'm going to have to pause the game sadly

5026
07:07:50,000 --> 07:07:52,000
because there can be NPC events

5027
07:07:52,000 --> 07:07:54,000
such as cultists entering the town

5028
07:07:54,000 --> 07:07:56,000
which can kill NPCs.

5029
07:07:56,000 --> 07:07:57,000
So I will have it paused

5030
07:07:57,000 --> 07:07:59,000
whilst I go quickly make a cup of tea.

5031
07:07:59,000 --> 07:08:04,000
Please do stretch your legs

5032
07:08:04,000 --> 07:08:06,000
and get yourself a wee water

5033
07:08:06,000 --> 07:08:09,000
and have a pee.

5034
07:08:09,000 --> 07:08:11,000
You've got to sleep.

5035
07:08:11,000 --> 07:08:12,000
No.

5036
07:08:12,000 --> 07:08:14,000
All right, sorry, man.

5037
07:08:14,000 --> 07:08:16,000
Yeah, I thought you had to sleep right away

5038
07:08:16,000 --> 07:08:18,000
but I need to receive the letter

5039
07:08:18,000 --> 07:08:19,000
with a hand that says we know

5040
07:08:19,000 --> 07:08:22,000
and then go to sleep, okay?

5041
07:08:22,000 --> 07:08:24,000
So go for a tinkle.

5042
07:08:24,000 --> 07:08:25,000
Go get some water.

5043
07:08:25,000 --> 07:08:27,000
I'm going to get a cup of tea

5044
07:08:27,000 --> 07:08:28,000
and we're going to recalibrate

5045
07:08:28,000 --> 07:08:30,000
and come back and meet in the middle.

5046
07:08:30,000 --> 07:08:32,000
It will be a couple of minutes, okay?

5047
07:08:32,000 --> 07:08:35,000
I think I can get a wee snack.

5048
07:08:35,000 --> 07:08:38,000
Right, I'll be right back.

5049
07:09:22,000 --> 07:09:24,000
Good night.

5050
07:09:52,000 --> 07:09:55,000
Good night.

5051
07:10:22,000 --> 07:10:25,000
Good night.

5052
07:10:52,000 --> 07:10:55,000
Good night.

5053
07:11:22,000 --> 07:11:24,000
Good night.

5054
07:11:52,000 --> 07:11:55,000
Good night.

5055
07:12:22,000 --> 07:12:24,000
Good night.

5056
07:12:52,000 --> 07:12:54,000
Good night.

5057
07:13:22,000 --> 07:13:25,000
Good night.

5058
07:13:52,000 --> 07:13:54,000
Good night.

5059
07:14:22,000 --> 07:14:24,000
Good night.

5060
07:14:52,000 --> 07:15:05,000
Welcome to Europe.

5061
07:15:05,000 --> 07:15:07,000
Oh, wait, I said that wrong.

5062
07:15:07,000 --> 07:15:10,000
Welcome to Europe, young man.

5063
07:15:10,000 --> 07:15:15,000
Remember that 10-year-old vision?

5064
07:15:15,000 --> 07:15:18,000
Remember that 10-year-old vision?

5065
07:15:18,000 --> 07:15:20,000
Oh.

5066
07:15:20,000 --> 07:15:23,000
Sorry, that was the worst Dutch I think I've ever done so far.

5067
07:15:23,000 --> 07:15:25,000
I do apologize to any...

5068
07:15:25,000 --> 07:15:28,000
...Nederland-Mensen who are listening in.

5069
07:15:28,000 --> 07:15:30,000
But everyone else is just like,

5070
07:15:30,000 --> 07:15:32,000
what on earth are you even on about?

5071
07:15:32,000 --> 07:15:34,000
Hi.

5072
07:15:34,000 --> 07:15:36,000
Welcome back.

5073
07:15:36,000 --> 07:15:38,000
What, you thought I was gone forever?

5074
07:15:38,000 --> 07:15:40,000
I've got me a cup of tea,

5075
07:15:40,000 --> 07:15:42,000
and I've actually got strupewafel.

5076
07:15:42,000 --> 07:15:43,000
I'm not even kidding.

5077
07:15:43,000 --> 07:15:45,000
I have actual strupewafel.

5078
07:15:45,000 --> 07:15:48,000
I was supposed to eat it on the rating stream,

5079
07:15:48,000 --> 07:15:53,000
but I couldn't find any more European snacks.

5080
07:15:53,000 --> 07:15:58,000
So I'm just literally going to eat a little strupewafel.

5081
07:15:58,000 --> 07:16:01,000
Welcome back.

5082
07:16:01,000 --> 07:16:02,000
I love...

5083
07:16:02,000 --> 07:16:04,000
Strupewafel is like crack cocaine.

5084
07:16:04,000 --> 07:16:06,000
Sorry, but it's not.

5085
07:16:06,000 --> 07:16:08,000
Strupewafel is like crack cocaine.

5086
07:16:08,000 --> 07:16:10,000
Sorry, but it's so good.

5087
07:16:10,000 --> 07:16:12,000
Um...

5088
07:16:12,000 --> 07:16:16,000
Yes, mercy for the snippets who are lurking.

5089
07:16:16,000 --> 07:16:19,000
I appreciate you, even if I'm not your flavor.

5090
07:16:19,000 --> 07:16:20,000
Um...

5091
07:16:20,000 --> 07:16:26,000
Tea minus one hour and 40 minutes until your...

5092
07:16:26,000 --> 07:16:31,000
Kohai is ready to say hi-hi.

5093
07:16:31,000 --> 07:16:33,000
And prove that she can't whistle.

5094
07:16:33,000 --> 07:16:35,000
Which is adorable.

5095
07:16:35,000 --> 07:16:38,000
I can't believe I hired her on the basis she can't whistle.

5096
07:16:38,000 --> 07:16:39,000
Stop leaving a...

5097
07:16:39,000 --> 07:16:42,000
What? I'm not allowed to go get a cup of tea?

5098
07:16:42,000 --> 07:16:44,000
For my boys?

5099
07:16:44,000 --> 07:16:45,000
What do you mean?

5100
07:16:45,000 --> 07:16:47,000
You like hearing my words?

5101
07:16:47,000 --> 07:16:48,000
Like all cranky?

5102
07:16:48,000 --> 07:16:49,000
Yeah.

5103
07:16:49,000 --> 07:16:51,000
Are you ending when mercy comes on?

5104
07:16:51,000 --> 07:16:54,000
Yes, I'm going to redirect into her on purpose

5105
07:16:54,000 --> 07:16:59,000
because I didn't know I was getting monetization today.

5106
07:16:59,000 --> 07:17:02,000
So tomorrow we're doing the monetization celebration.

5107
07:17:02,000 --> 07:17:05,000
So I need to set up like all the emotes

5108
07:17:05,000 --> 07:17:08,000
and I need to set up on the price.

5109
07:17:08,000 --> 07:17:12,000
And I think very sadly I have to freaking charge more than 4.99

5110
07:17:12,000 --> 07:17:19,000
and I really don't want to charge more than 4.99 US dollars.

5111
07:17:19,000 --> 07:17:24,000
But I think I might have to because of this YouTube gifting stuff.

5112
07:17:24,000 --> 07:17:29,000
Can any of yous confirm that YouTube gifting thing is a nightmare or a hassle?

5113
07:17:29,000 --> 07:17:31,000
I'm going to take a bite of my waffle.

5114
07:17:41,000 --> 07:17:44,000
I know it's only like 2 cents difference.

5115
07:17:44,000 --> 07:17:46,000
I just don't like that.

5116
07:17:46,000 --> 07:17:47,000
Hold on.

5117
07:17:47,000 --> 07:17:53,000
I'm going to check out marshmallows.

5118
07:17:53,000 --> 07:17:55,000
If you'd like to send me any marshmallows,

5119
07:17:55,000 --> 07:18:00,000
I'm just going to take a quick pause champ on top of everything.

5120
07:18:00,000 --> 07:18:01,000
Jesus Christ.

5121
07:18:01,000 --> 07:18:03,000
Why do I have so many DMs?

5122
07:18:06,000 --> 07:18:07,000
Okay.

5123
07:18:07,000 --> 07:18:08,000
I don't know.

5124
07:18:09,000 --> 07:18:10,000
Oh good.

5125
07:18:10,000 --> 07:18:11,000
For the most part.

5126
07:18:12,000 --> 07:18:14,000
Oh, and now I can't see my mouse again.

5127
07:18:16,000 --> 07:18:17,000
Okay, marshmallow refresh.

5128
07:18:17,000 --> 07:18:18,000
Let's go.

5129
07:18:19,000 --> 07:18:28,000
A lot of follow girls have 1.99 tier and then 4.99 and the gift goes to the 4.99.

5130
07:18:32,000 --> 07:18:34,000
Would exactly 5 dollars work?

5131
07:18:34,000 --> 07:18:35,000
I possibly.

5132
07:18:46,000 --> 07:18:47,000
Hello mummy.

5133
07:18:47,000 --> 07:18:50,000
You're asking what software baby uses for 3D.

5134
07:18:50,000 --> 07:18:54,000
It's called Warudo for full body tracking.

5135
07:18:54,000 --> 07:18:56,000
There's a lot of videos about it.

5136
07:18:56,000 --> 07:18:59,000
But I think most YouTubers use Sony MoCopy,

5137
07:18:59,000 --> 07:19:03,000
SlimeVR or Vine trackers.

5138
07:19:03,000 --> 07:19:04,000
Okay, okay.

5139
07:19:07,000 --> 07:19:08,000
It's okay mummy.

5140
07:19:08,000 --> 07:19:10,000
I know you can't open my last Mario link on stream.

5141
07:19:10,000 --> 07:19:13,000
Don't forget to check later.

5142
07:19:13,000 --> 07:19:15,000
Is it bad that I check?

5143
07:19:15,000 --> 07:19:17,000
Like as soon as I go offline,

5144
07:19:17,000 --> 07:19:20,000
I just spend like another 30 minutes and I'm like, yeah.

5145
07:19:26,000 --> 07:19:27,000
What's the problem with gifting?

5146
07:19:27,000 --> 07:19:32,000
So the issue is if someone is very kind to gift,

5147
07:19:32,000 --> 07:19:35,000
but they can't dictate what type of tier to give,

5148
07:19:35,000 --> 07:19:40,000
it means outsiders isn't a nice term to use.

5149
07:19:40,000 --> 07:19:41,000
That's not the correct term.

5150
07:19:41,000 --> 07:19:45,000
But someone who maybe...

5151
07:19:47,000 --> 07:19:48,000
What's the word?

5152
07:19:48,000 --> 07:19:50,000
I'm trying to think.

5153
07:19:51,000 --> 07:19:57,000
Someone who gets access to membership streams

5154
07:19:57,000 --> 07:19:59,000
that should name.

5155
07:19:59,000 --> 07:20:04,000
You know, like someone who's just going to be rude about it

5156
07:20:04,000 --> 07:20:05,000
or whatever.

5157
07:20:06,000 --> 07:20:07,000
I don't know.

5158
07:20:08,000 --> 07:20:11,000
Yeah, use whatever.

5159
07:20:11,000 --> 07:20:15,000
It's better to have people watching the membership streams

5160
07:20:15,000 --> 07:20:17,000
that are actually interested

5161
07:20:17,000 --> 07:20:20,000
because someone might get a message

5162
07:20:20,000 --> 07:20:23,000
and it's like, oh right, okay.

5163
07:20:29,000 --> 07:20:32,000
You might be able to turn on gifting entirely.

5164
07:20:32,000 --> 07:20:34,000
Well, the problem is gifting is a massive money source

5165
07:20:34,000 --> 07:20:35,000
for the girls.

5166
07:20:38,000 --> 07:20:43,000
If someone's going to be a shitter in members' content,

5167
07:20:43,000 --> 07:20:45,000
they better be paying out their own pocket.

5168
07:20:45,000 --> 07:20:47,000
Ah, that's so funny.

5169
07:20:47,000 --> 07:20:49,000
I'm sorry, but that's actually such a funny statement.

5170
07:20:51,000 --> 07:20:53,000
Okay, Strani and fellow reeflings.

5171
07:20:53,000 --> 07:20:58,000
I'm going to have a fun rest of the stream.

5172
07:20:58,000 --> 07:20:59,000
Oh, now I need to go.

5173
07:20:59,000 --> 07:21:01,000
Sorry, fucking words are blending together.

5174
07:21:01,000 --> 07:21:03,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

5175
07:21:03,000 --> 07:21:06,000
Yes, I think it'll be roughly two hours.

5176
07:21:07,000 --> 07:21:09,000
It's a short stream tomorrow, do apologize,

5177
07:21:09,000 --> 07:21:11,000
but I'm needing overall vocal rest.

5178
07:21:11,000 --> 07:21:14,000
I've got quite a few VTuber ASMR collabs coming up,

5179
07:21:14,000 --> 07:21:18,000
so I'm needing to be a good girl and rest and try my best.

5180
07:21:21,000 --> 07:21:24,000
I am a Spanish reefling and I've been very...

5181
07:21:25,000 --> 07:21:26,000
No, you've not.

5182
07:21:28,000 --> 07:21:29,000
Hold on.

5183
07:21:30,000 --> 07:21:32,000
You've helped me pass some hard times,

5184
07:21:32,000 --> 07:21:35,000
so I just want to know that if you're really proud of you

5185
07:21:35,000 --> 07:21:37,000
your streams go...

5186
07:21:37,000 --> 07:21:42,000
Also, I like how you act on stream about gapping

5187
07:21:42,000 --> 07:21:44,000
and ranking burps is fun.

5188
07:21:44,000 --> 07:21:46,000
Se te quiera.

5189
07:21:46,000 --> 07:21:53,000
What is se te quiera in español in English for me,

5190
07:21:53,000 --> 07:21:56,000
because I don't know what se te quiera means.

5191
07:21:57,000 --> 07:21:58,000
I think it means.

5192
07:22:00,000 --> 07:22:01,000
I don't even know.

5193
07:22:05,000 --> 07:22:07,000
You are truly an anomaly.

5194
07:22:07,000 --> 07:22:11,000
I've never seen someone who is so intensely thoughtful

5195
07:22:11,000 --> 07:22:15,000
in caring about both your daughters and reefillings.

5196
07:22:15,000 --> 07:22:17,000
Yeah, also shameless.

5197
07:22:17,000 --> 07:22:18,000
Hold on.

5198
07:22:18,000 --> 07:22:19,000
What am I getting?

5199
07:22:19,000 --> 07:22:21,000
What am I getting spanked by?

5200
07:22:22,000 --> 07:22:24,000
It's a level of authenticity.

5201
07:22:24,000 --> 07:22:26,000
I would never...

5202
07:22:26,000 --> 07:22:29,000
I would never even see in a person,

5203
07:22:29,000 --> 07:22:30,000
let alone a VTuber.

5204
07:22:30,000 --> 07:22:32,000
I wish you all the success in the world.

5205
07:22:32,000 --> 07:22:33,000
Wow.

5206
07:22:33,000 --> 07:22:35,000
You did an absolutely fantastic job

5207
07:22:35,000 --> 07:22:37,000
on the tryharding in the ASMR stream.

5208
07:22:37,000 --> 07:22:39,000
I can only assume you have a really good coach

5209
07:22:39,000 --> 07:22:42,000
since it took me over a year to study to get to that level.

5210
07:22:43,000 --> 07:22:44,000
A coach?

5211
07:22:44,000 --> 07:22:46,000
Like a hypno coach?

5212
07:22:46,000 --> 07:22:47,000
No.

5213
07:22:47,000 --> 07:22:49,000
That's just called autism.

5214
07:22:49,000 --> 07:22:51,000
In general interest.

5215
07:22:51,000 --> 07:22:54,000
I just apply what I like to whatever

5216
07:22:54,000 --> 07:22:56,000
and I do it my way.

5217
07:22:56,000 --> 07:22:58,000
Also, it's something I would never do otherwise,

5218
07:22:58,000 --> 07:22:59,000
but my...

5219
07:23:00,000 --> 07:23:03,000
But my girlfriend has convinced me

5220
07:23:03,000 --> 07:23:04,000
I should do...

5221
07:23:04,000 --> 07:23:05,000
Bibbius?

5222
07:23:05,000 --> 07:23:07,000
So I've printed out 21 pages

5223
07:23:07,000 --> 07:23:10,000
so I can build some additional cognitive habits.

5224
07:23:10,000 --> 07:23:12,000
I made a collage by the end of the month.

5225
07:23:13,000 --> 07:23:14,000
What?

5226
07:23:14,000 --> 07:23:16,000
What is this?

5227
07:23:23,000 --> 07:23:24,000
What?

5228
07:23:24,000 --> 07:23:25,000
Well...

5229
07:23:26,000 --> 07:23:27,000
What is this?

5230
07:23:28,000 --> 07:23:31,000
What are these additional cognitive habits?

5231
07:23:32,000 --> 07:23:33,000
What is this?

5232
07:23:36,000 --> 07:23:37,000
21 Bibbius?

5233
07:23:37,000 --> 07:23:38,000
For me?

5234
07:23:38,000 --> 07:23:39,000
For me?

5235
07:23:39,000 --> 07:23:40,000
You have that in you?

5236
07:23:40,000 --> 07:23:41,000
Right now?

5237
07:23:43,000 --> 07:23:44,000
It's almost 5 am.

5238
07:23:44,000 --> 07:23:45,000
Yes, please rest well.

5239
07:23:45,000 --> 07:23:48,000
For those of you who are hanging on by a thread,

5240
07:23:48,000 --> 07:23:52,000
we're just going to start off the Dark Brotherhood

5241
07:23:52,000 --> 07:23:53,000
at this point.

5242
07:23:53,000 --> 07:23:55,000
I'm going to see if I can fix achievements

5243
07:23:55,000 --> 07:23:57,000
and possibly we can come back to Skyrim,

5244
07:23:57,000 --> 07:23:59,000
but tomorrow is being steamrolled

5245
07:23:59,000 --> 07:24:01,000
by monetization celebration stream.

5246
07:24:03,000 --> 07:24:06,000
Gotta get those micro plastics out of you somehow, honestly.

5247
07:24:11,000 --> 07:24:14,000
Hey Lassie, would you kindly raise the model up

5248
07:24:14,000 --> 07:24:16,000
so you can see more of the girlies?

5249
07:24:16,000 --> 07:24:17,000
You could zoom out a bit too

5250
07:24:17,000 --> 07:24:19,000
if you don't want to block too much of the game.

5251
07:24:20,000 --> 07:24:22,000
Someone said they don't like it.

5252
07:24:23,000 --> 07:24:24,000
Where is it?

5253
07:24:25,000 --> 07:24:27,000
I would have to go like this.

5254
07:24:31,000 --> 07:24:32,000
Does this work?

5255
07:24:32,000 --> 07:24:33,000
Hold on.

5256
07:24:34,000 --> 07:24:35,000
Does that work?

5257
07:24:36,000 --> 07:24:37,000
It does work.

5258
07:24:41,000 --> 07:24:42,000
That's terrible.

5259
07:24:45,000 --> 07:24:47,000
I can't really get away with it too much.

5260
07:24:48,000 --> 07:24:49,000
Let's behave.

5261
07:24:49,000 --> 07:24:54,000
A tomato a day keeps the other boys okay.

5262
07:24:54,000 --> 07:24:57,000
Yes, that is our new slogan, ladies and gentlemen.

5263
07:24:58,000 --> 07:25:01,000
Tomato a day keeps the other boy else okay.

5264
07:25:02,000 --> 07:25:04,000
I'm still trying to eat the same strip waffle.

5265
07:25:04,000 --> 07:25:05,000
I'm getting so distracted.

5266
07:25:06,000 --> 07:25:08,000
So when's the audio of you rambling about assassin's greed

5267
07:25:08,000 --> 07:25:10,000
or something while getting your...

5268
07:25:13,000 --> 07:25:15,000
Oh my god, you guys are getting our while.

5269
07:25:16,000 --> 07:25:18,000
I'm actually doing a review.

5270
07:25:19,000 --> 07:25:24,000
On Assassin's Creed Brotherhood

5271
07:25:24,000 --> 07:25:26,000
which should come out around November.

5272
07:25:26,000 --> 07:25:28,000
Like I'm doing an actual game review footage.

5273
07:25:28,000 --> 07:25:30,000
Like I'm being so serious on it.

5274
07:25:30,000 --> 07:25:33,000
So if you like hearing my accent putting you to sleep

5275
07:25:33,000 --> 07:25:35,000
well I can tell you about Assassin's Creed

5276
07:25:35,000 --> 07:25:36,000
and how amazing it is.

5277
07:25:39,000 --> 07:25:41,000
Sometimes I wish we could see the film.

5278
07:25:41,000 --> 07:25:43,000
They're pretty outrageous.

5279
07:25:43,000 --> 07:25:46,000
I'm trying my best to like dart around them.

5280
07:25:46,000 --> 07:25:48,000
But good night rest well those who need to rest.

5281
07:25:49,000 --> 07:25:51,000
I love Strauner's The Cuttlefish in this hoose.

5282
07:25:55,000 --> 07:25:59,000
Strauny, if you like V&N games, kind of reckon Valhalla is such a good game

5283
07:25:59,000 --> 07:26:00,000
and I think you'll like it.

5284
07:26:00,000 --> 07:26:02,000
I most certainly will check that out.

5285
07:26:02,000 --> 07:26:04,000
I may have in another life thought I was about to play it

5286
07:26:04,000 --> 07:26:06,000
and then play the complete wrong game

5287
07:26:06,000 --> 07:26:08,000
which was called Helltaker I believe.

5288
07:26:08,000 --> 07:26:09,000
And it was also a puzzle game

5289
07:26:09,000 --> 07:26:12,000
and I was so confused on why the game looked so different

5290
07:26:12,000 --> 07:26:14,000
to what I was playing

5291
07:26:14,000 --> 07:26:16,000
and it turns out I was playing the completely wrong game.

5292
07:26:16,000 --> 07:26:19,000
But yes, I would love to give Valhalla a try.

5293
07:26:21,000 --> 07:26:24,000
Hi cuttles, are Mondays and Tuesdays always going to be endurance?

5294
07:26:27,000 --> 07:26:29,000
No, they are not.

5295
07:26:29,000 --> 07:26:33,000
It's just a Quinky Dink really that I put on Monday and Tuesday.

5296
07:26:33,000 --> 07:26:36,000
But no, they're not always going to be the endurance on those days.

5297
07:26:38,000 --> 07:26:39,000
Yes.

5298
07:26:46,000 --> 07:26:47,000
Having you laugh about to...

5299
07:26:47,000 --> 07:26:48,000
Are you squiddin' me right now?

5300
07:26:48,000 --> 07:26:49,000
By the Pope!

5301
07:27:02,000 --> 07:27:03,000
I'm going to be so honest.

5302
07:27:03,000 --> 07:27:06,000
Brian did not help with my confusion

5303
07:27:06,000 --> 07:27:09,000
on the pronunciation of your name, tiny spainy.

5304
07:27:10,000 --> 07:27:11,000
What?

5305
07:27:11,000 --> 07:27:13,000
And you had it right.

5306
07:27:13,000 --> 07:27:17,000
As spainy is pronounced like a spainy anteater.

5307
07:27:17,000 --> 07:27:23,000
A spainy anteater or a spiny anteater.

5308
07:27:24,000 --> 07:27:26,000
Brian just made that ten times worse

5309
07:27:26,000 --> 07:27:29,000
and I do apologize if I'm now officially butchering it

5310
07:27:29,000 --> 07:27:30,000
but thank you for the tip.

5311
07:27:31,000 --> 07:27:33,000
Do it phonetically in chat.

5312
07:27:34,000 --> 07:27:37,000
Right, so it's either spainy

5313
07:27:37,000 --> 07:27:41,000
or did I even spainy?

5314
07:27:41,000 --> 07:27:42,000
So, you know.

5315
07:27:45,000 --> 07:27:46,000
Spainy.

5316
07:27:46,000 --> 07:27:47,000
Okay.

5317
07:27:47,000 --> 07:27:48,000
Spainy.

5318
07:27:49,000 --> 07:27:50,000
We got there in the end.

5319
07:27:50,000 --> 07:27:55,000
Literally, I'm renaming everyone who just doesn't have an easy to rename for me.

5320
07:27:58,000 --> 07:27:59,000
Spiny.

5321
07:27:59,000 --> 07:28:04,000
There are Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday endurance streams.

5322
07:28:04,000 --> 07:28:05,000
Yes.

5323
07:28:06,000 --> 07:28:07,000
Mostly the stream stipend.

5324
07:28:07,000 --> 07:28:10,000
I'll try and do for like a big amount of time

5325
07:28:10,000 --> 07:28:12,000
because I know not everyone's available

5326
07:28:12,000 --> 07:28:15,000
at the one time zone, if you will.

5327
07:28:22,000 --> 07:28:24,000
Having you up about developmental psychology

5328
07:28:24,000 --> 07:28:30,000
and socially inculcated reactions to stress

5329
07:28:30,000 --> 07:28:32,000
made me realize I really wish that physical touch and affection

5330
07:28:32,000 --> 07:28:33,000
was more normalised in society.

5331
07:28:33,000 --> 07:28:35,000
Especially for men, male socialised people.

5332
07:28:35,000 --> 07:28:36,000
People need more hugs these days.

5333
07:28:36,000 --> 07:28:38,000
Also, I'm curious how you deal with the stress

5334
07:28:38,000 --> 07:28:41,000
and she mentioned you don't know how we do it.

5335
07:28:44,000 --> 07:28:48,000
I always have a goal or something to work towards

5336
07:28:48,000 --> 07:28:51,000
which helps distract me from what I'm feeling in the moment

5337
07:28:51,000 --> 07:28:55,000
and essentially makes me numb and work through it

5338
07:28:55,000 --> 07:28:59,000
so right now my goal is to help the girls achieve what they want.

5339
07:29:00,000 --> 07:29:03,000
So I'm like, even though I'm stressed

5340
07:29:03,000 --> 07:29:06,000
and I'm worried and I'm this and I'm that

5341
07:29:06,000 --> 07:29:11,000
because they are a much more important focus on my life

5342
07:29:11,000 --> 07:29:15,000
it's kind of one of those things where I can just put it to the side for now

5343
07:29:15,000 --> 07:29:18,000
and right, okay, what's next?

5344
07:29:18,000 --> 07:29:21,000
Once I get offline, I have some lovely VTubers

5345
07:29:21,000 --> 07:29:23,000
who are waiting on an ASMR collab from me.

5346
07:29:23,000 --> 07:29:26,000
I have to send away shorts for the girls.

5347
07:29:26,000 --> 07:29:28,000
I need to record that for them.

5348
07:29:29,000 --> 07:29:31,000
I need to do...

5349
07:29:38,000 --> 07:29:40,000
Every word is hard to pronounce.

5350
07:29:40,000 --> 07:29:44,000
If you're bad enough, for example, I pronounce spatula, spatula.

5351
07:29:44,000 --> 07:29:50,000
Honestly, I think having a purpose is really useful in general.

5352
07:29:50,000 --> 07:29:53,000
Yes, I agree with that, I also do it that way.

5353
07:29:53,000 --> 07:29:57,000
It's so tough to tackle men's socialisation

5354
07:29:57,000 --> 07:30:01,000
because where does it start?

5355
07:30:01,000 --> 07:30:05,000
It starts in the home, but then where does it get affected?

5356
07:30:05,000 --> 07:30:07,000
Secondary socialisation at school.

5357
07:30:07,000 --> 07:30:11,000
I don't know if you guys had this, but in Scotland

5358
07:30:14,000 --> 07:30:18,000
it became so quickly, oh that's gay, to show any affection

5359
07:30:18,000 --> 07:30:23,000
in any sense, in a basic hug, a basic handshake

5360
07:30:23,000 --> 07:30:26,000
rubbing shoulders against each other.

5361
07:30:26,000 --> 07:30:30,000
If you're both gay, you get, you get, and it starts from there

5362
07:30:30,000 --> 07:30:34,000
and then that isolation progresses further and further

5363
07:30:34,000 --> 07:30:38,000
to the point where the most natural thing,

5364
07:30:38,000 --> 07:30:42,000
which is a reassuring hug or embrace when you meet someone you know

5365
07:30:42,000 --> 07:30:49,000
becomes this almost taboo, unfamiliar territory.

5366
07:30:49,000 --> 07:30:53,000
And it is such a shame that you even have to experience that

5367
07:30:53,000 --> 07:30:57,000
because of the secondary socialisation, because your primary socialisation

5368
07:30:57,000 --> 07:31:01,000
which is your family, you know about your dad came home

5369
07:31:01,000 --> 07:31:05,000
and you gave him a big hug, like oh dad, and when you went and visited

5370
07:31:05,000 --> 07:31:08,000
your grandparents, oh granddad, grand, and gave him a wee kiss

5371
07:31:08,000 --> 07:31:12,000
and a wee hug and all that, and it all goes out the window

5372
07:31:12,000 --> 07:31:16,000
because of secondary socialisation.

5373
07:31:16,000 --> 07:31:20,000
Yet behind closed doors, behind closed doors, behind families

5374
07:31:20,000 --> 07:31:24,000
perfectly normal, absolutely normal behaviour

5375
07:31:24,000 --> 07:31:30,000
and it's very frustrating because to even think of how to tackle it

5376
07:31:30,000 --> 07:31:33,000
where do you even start?

5377
07:31:33,000 --> 07:31:38,000
Because the way it's set up is it's your fault

5378
07:31:38,000 --> 07:31:42,000
on an individual level that you can't do these things

5379
07:31:42,000 --> 07:31:46,000
that you can't hug your bro that you meet up with once a month

5380
07:31:46,000 --> 07:31:50,000
and you can, it's your fault because

5381
07:31:50,000 --> 07:31:54,000
you didn't keep up with that societal norm, you didn't break the moat

5382
07:31:54,000 --> 07:31:59,000
you, like see how it's so hard to break from society's grasp at that point?

5383
07:31:59,000 --> 07:32:04,000
Someone says how's the game going? I'm so sorry, I'm currently in a rant about

5384
07:32:04,000 --> 07:32:10,000
the social education that you get after, I'm freaking going on a rant again

5385
07:32:10,000 --> 07:32:14,000
I can't stop, I can't stop myself, it's fascinating stuff

5386
07:32:14,000 --> 07:32:18,000
when you start to really break it down, it becomes almost

5387
07:32:18,000 --> 07:32:22,000
frustrating when you realise how bare bones and simplistic humans

5388
07:32:22,000 --> 07:32:26,000
are in nature and yet we are, pardon me, sorry, I'm burping away

5389
07:32:26,000 --> 07:32:29,000
we are our own biggest enemies

5390
07:32:29,000 --> 07:32:34,000
we live in a society, literally, I'm typing that too

5391
07:32:34,000 --> 07:32:39,000
we live in a society

5392
07:32:39,000 --> 07:32:43,000
that's it, I'm typing that in chat, that's me getting it out there

5393
07:32:43,000 --> 07:32:47,000
we live in a society, get that out, get that off your chest

5394
07:32:47,000 --> 07:32:51,000
you're welcome to type we live in a society as well in chat to get it off your chest

5395
07:32:51,000 --> 07:32:55,000
because we do live in a society

5396
07:32:55,000 --> 07:32:59,000
we live in a society, therapy stream when?

5397
07:32:59,000 --> 07:33:03,000
oh I'm not sure I can do that, Mercy's actually doing

5398
07:33:03,000 --> 07:33:07,000
a terrible therapy advice stream

5399
07:33:07,000 --> 07:33:11,000
we live in a society

5400
07:33:11,000 --> 07:33:15,000
wait, yes

5401
07:33:15,000 --> 07:33:19,000
wait, yes, that, sorry, I just read that

5402
07:33:19,000 --> 07:33:23,000
refling that was like your toes did everything for me, you're welcome

5403
07:33:23,000 --> 07:33:27,000
after this stream

5404
07:33:27,000 --> 07:33:31,000
tonight, with all the conspiracy talk, I need you to do

5405
07:33:31,000 --> 07:33:35,000
conspiracy theory talking stream with Pippa, it would be incredible, love your yapping

5406
07:33:35,000 --> 07:33:39,000
I just can't wait to get enough of the adorable cut of it, oh I don't know if I would go too far

5407
07:33:39,000 --> 07:33:43,000
I've not had a chance to watch Pippa's content in a very long time

5408
07:33:43,000 --> 07:33:47,000
but I don't know if I would go too far and I'm like

5409
07:33:47,000 --> 07:33:51,000
I, my ideas are quite

5410
07:33:51,000 --> 07:33:55,000
alienating, like as much as we were meming on needy streamer overload

5411
07:33:55,000 --> 07:33:59,000
my

5412
07:33:59,000 --> 07:34:03,000
I know you're not really supposed to talk about any of that, you're supposed to be a tee hee

5413
07:34:03,000 --> 07:34:07,000
but yeah, I'm thinking you never know

5414
07:34:07,000 --> 07:34:11,000
I plan on writing a fairly long fantasy of mine

5415
07:34:11,000 --> 07:34:15,000
I've had of you, it's still cringe, I want to write it though as it was extremely

5416
07:34:15,000 --> 07:34:19,000
pent up after you did it, is pace been fine for this

5417
07:34:19,000 --> 07:34:23,000
yes, I recommend it

5418
07:34:23,000 --> 07:34:27,000
oh no, strong is a moon truth, oh god what's that, I don't even know what that is

5419
07:34:27,000 --> 07:34:31,000
I don't know if I'd go too far, she says when talking about the yabba

5420
07:34:31,000 --> 07:34:35,000
it would be a race to see who will go too far, you're a Pippa

5421
07:34:35,000 --> 07:34:39,000
I'm like, I'm probably

5422
07:34:39,000 --> 07:34:43,000
1984 dystopian type

5423
07:34:43,000 --> 07:34:47,000
allegations, I don't know what

5424
07:34:47,000 --> 07:34:51,000
Pippa's field is in particular

5425
07:34:51,000 --> 07:34:55,000
but I am dystopian based, whatever horrors of man made comprehension you

5426
07:34:55,000 --> 07:34:59,000
can think of, have occurred, you know, I'm like that

5427
07:34:59,000 --> 07:35:03,000
kind of side of things, can you please say in the thickest

5428
07:35:03,000 --> 07:35:07,000
Thailand accent

5429
07:35:07,000 --> 07:35:11,000
I cast tongue positional

5430
07:35:11,000 --> 07:35:15,000
awareness, sorry that was a really rough accent but there you go

5431
07:35:15,000 --> 07:35:19,000
what's your favourite, Pringles favour

5432
07:35:19,000 --> 07:35:23,000
paprika, I love Pappangles, Pippa is there

5433
07:35:23,000 --> 07:35:27,000
and lizards are in government, literally 1984, Shawnee Calls

5434
07:35:27,000 --> 07:35:31,000
Pippa is just

5435
07:35:31,000 --> 07:35:35,000
psycho, she'll go way too far quicker

5436
07:35:35,000 --> 07:35:39,000
well we shouldn't egg her on, how about we just leave this as

5437
07:35:39,000 --> 07:35:43,000
moon truth or believes the moon is a hologram

5438
07:35:43,000 --> 07:35:47,000
is a conspiracy theory made up to clown on

5439
07:35:47,000 --> 07:35:51,000
that people actually started, well

5440
07:35:51,000 --> 07:35:55,000
I have terrible news, I'm afraid I don't meet much of the requirements of a conspiracy

5441
07:35:55,000 --> 07:35:59,000
theory, I'm afraid that yes, our planet is in fact

5442
07:35:59,000 --> 07:36:03,000
very controversial, I know

5443
07:36:03,000 --> 07:36:07,000
it's okay, it's okay, you can unsubscribe

5444
07:36:07,000 --> 07:36:11,000
at least it's not Fahrenheit 451 yet

5445
07:36:11,000 --> 07:36:15,000
right?

5446
07:36:15,000 --> 07:36:19,000
yeah, Fahrenheit 451

5447
07:36:19,000 --> 07:36:23,000
yeah

5448
07:36:23,000 --> 07:36:27,000
I guess if the reason why

5449
07:36:27,000 --> 07:36:31,000
a lot of media before

5450
07:36:31,000 --> 07:36:35,000
a certain year was kind of scrubbed on a mass level, so people realise

5451
07:36:35,000 --> 07:36:39,000
people don't know that in every 100 years

5452
07:36:39,000 --> 07:36:43,000
I try to get a sense of that

5453
07:36:43,000 --> 07:36:51,000
true, Iron Reaver true

5454
07:36:51,000 --> 07:36:55,000
right, imagine burning books

5455
07:36:55,000 --> 07:36:59,000
you're a round airther unsubbed, I can't believe it

5456
07:36:59,000 --> 07:37:03,000
the moon round, the sun round

5457
07:37:03,000 --> 07:37:07,000
the earth on a turtle's back and world of warcraft

5458
07:37:07,000 --> 07:37:11,000
that's all I'm saying

5459
07:37:11,000 --> 07:37:15,000
the earth is round, oh wait isn't it not like a, there's like a certain name

5460
07:37:15,000 --> 07:37:19,000
because it's like a wonky round and not a perfect round

5461
07:37:19,000 --> 07:37:23,000
something like that

5462
07:37:23,000 --> 07:37:27,000
have I shared any bibboots?

5463
07:37:27,000 --> 07:37:31,000
I actually don't share them with the girls

5464
07:37:31,000 --> 07:37:35,000
just because

5465
07:37:35,000 --> 07:37:39,000
I don't know I just, it's never really occurred to me to do such a thing

5466
07:37:39,000 --> 07:37:43,000
an oval lumpy ball, yeah a lumpy ball

5467
07:37:43,000 --> 07:37:47,000
remember to check your balls regularly

5468
07:37:47,000 --> 07:37:51,000
find a lump, get it checked out ladies and gentlemen

5469
07:37:51,000 --> 07:37:55,000
and before you go, it's embarrassing

5470
07:37:55,000 --> 07:37:59,000
I assure you the person who is doing the ultrasound on your boss act

5471
07:37:59,000 --> 07:38:03,000
has already looked at about 10 sacks that day already

5472
07:38:03,000 --> 07:38:07,000
and within that week has probably seen over 100

5473
07:38:07,000 --> 07:38:11,000
I assure you your wristicles raggy are not that unique

5474
07:38:11,000 --> 07:38:15,000
get yourself checked out if you are worried

5475
07:38:15,000 --> 07:38:19,000
an ultrasound, yeah that's what they do against your

5476
07:38:19,000 --> 07:38:23,000
if you have a bump you get an ultrasound on your

5477
07:38:23,000 --> 07:38:27,000
wristicle, raggy

5478
07:38:27,000 --> 07:38:31,000
that's not the thing, isn't that an ultrasound? I checked I'm clear

5479
07:38:31,000 --> 07:38:35,000
I mean we could check live if you want

5480
07:38:35,000 --> 07:38:39,000
wow I zoomed through the backlog at 2x speed after hearing

5481
07:38:39,000 --> 07:38:43,000
back where you read my marrow

5482
07:38:43,000 --> 07:38:47,000
I found a lump and they have no idea what it is

5483
07:38:47,000 --> 07:38:51,000
some things can be completely benign

5484
07:38:51,000 --> 07:38:55,000
like you know we all come out a bit wonky

5485
07:38:55,000 --> 07:38:59,000
can you come out 100% a perfect specimen now

5486
07:38:59,000 --> 07:39:03,000
it's definitely thing had me balls all just sounded clear

5487
07:39:03,000 --> 07:39:07,000
if you really want to, yeah right okay everyone follow my

5488
07:39:07,000 --> 07:39:11,000
do your hands have calluses, rougher smooth feet question mark

5489
07:39:11,000 --> 07:39:15,000
I have what's called hyper hydrosis

5490
07:39:15,000 --> 07:39:19,000
especially in my feet and I do have it in my hands

5491
07:39:19,000 --> 07:39:23,000
which means my hands are always very

5492
07:39:23,000 --> 07:39:27,000
smooth I have no dryness because I am constantly

5493
07:39:27,000 --> 07:39:31,000
wet really

5494
07:39:31,000 --> 07:39:35,000
there's nothing else to go off by but yes I always have like

5495
07:39:35,000 --> 07:39:39,000
kind of moist hands so they're always soft

5496
07:39:39,000 --> 07:39:43,000
my feet are incredibly soft so yeah

5497
07:39:43,000 --> 07:39:47,000
there you go now you know I was actually going to do a donathon reward

5498
07:39:47,000 --> 07:39:51,000
where I give the like for a second and third place

5499
07:39:51,000 --> 07:39:55,000
like thigh highs that I've worn but obviously with my sweaty feet

5500
07:39:55,000 --> 07:39:59,000
constantly they're not like dripping not dripping I don't need

5501
07:39:59,000 --> 07:40:03,000
Botox if you didn't know Botox will paralyze the

5502
07:40:03,000 --> 07:40:07,000
sweat cells but they are constantly

5503
07:40:07,000 --> 07:40:11,000
having like a

5504
07:40:11,000 --> 07:40:15,000
they're not dry put it that way most guys hands are like

5505
07:40:15,000 --> 07:40:19,000
dry so when you go like when you rub your hands together it's like

5506
07:40:19,000 --> 07:40:23,000
but when I rub my hands well when I put my hands together I can fart

5507
07:40:23,000 --> 07:40:27,000
with my hands because they're always clammy and wet and

5508
07:40:27,000 --> 07:40:31,000
yeah that's very true I can always do that

5509
07:40:31,000 --> 07:40:35,000
do it on command I can never find this

5510
07:40:35,000 --> 07:40:39,000
most called flushed that most called flushed

5511
07:40:39,000 --> 07:40:43,000
I can do that breathe it in lads and lasses well you are a cuttlefish

5512
07:40:43,000 --> 07:40:47,000
I'd be concerned if you were tonight you're so talented sweaty hands aren't fun

5513
07:40:47,000 --> 07:40:51,000
yes but it's a little bit annoying especially gaming with a

5514
07:40:51,000 --> 07:40:55,000
controller because of the heat transfer it reflects straight

5515
07:40:55,000 --> 07:40:59,000
back and my hands get very sweaty when I'm using a controller

5516
07:40:59,000 --> 07:41:03,000
fart hands game when your hands are dry just hold Chinese

5517
07:41:03,000 --> 07:41:07,000
I have enough sweat to make your hands nice and soft as well

5518
07:41:07,000 --> 07:41:11,000
okay there's enough to go around I assure you

5519
07:41:21,000 --> 07:41:25,000
don't read this out loud

5520
07:41:27,000 --> 07:41:31,000
oh my god I'm getting intel I'm getting intel

5521
07:41:31,000 --> 07:41:35,000
I know you said you wouldn't ever approach other

5522
07:41:35,000 --> 07:41:39,000
v-tubers but considering the similarity of line of work would you ever consider a collab

5523
07:41:39,000 --> 07:41:43,000
with project melody both of you seem very knowledgeable and passionate about

5524
07:41:43,000 --> 07:41:47,000
positive A in education mental health I feel like you would be great for us

5525
07:41:47,000 --> 07:41:51,000
I would never say no

5526
07:41:51,000 --> 07:41:55,000
but at this point in time you know

5527
07:41:55,000 --> 07:41:59,000
I'm just gonna focus on getting the girls like their achievement stuff

5528
07:41:59,000 --> 07:42:03,000
I would never say no but like to reach out is quite

5529
07:42:03,000 --> 07:42:07,000
you know daunting I'm sure anyone can kind of relate to that kind of

5530
07:42:07,000 --> 07:42:11,000
thing

5531
07:42:11,000 --> 07:42:15,000
yeah I would never say no a lot of people said that

5532
07:42:15,000 --> 07:42:19,000
me and project melody seem to be like

5533
07:42:19,000 --> 07:42:23,000
opposites and yet the same type thing with their kind of care and all that jazz

5534
07:42:23,000 --> 07:42:27,000
reefing intelligent agency since you have hyper hydrolysis

5535
07:42:27,000 --> 07:42:31,000
do you keep yourself well hydrated the way that I can tell

5536
07:42:31,000 --> 07:42:35,000
I'm actually severely dehydrated as my hands go dry

5537
07:42:35,000 --> 07:42:39,000
that's when I know I'm like up

5538
07:42:39,000 --> 07:42:43,000
creek basically as if my hands stop my feet will never

5539
07:42:43,000 --> 07:42:47,000
stop I have never been aware of my feet stopping

5540
07:42:47,000 --> 07:42:51,000

5542
07:42:55,000 --> 07:42:59,000

5544
07:43:03,000 --> 07:43:07,000
day felt like I was doing it on purpose like oh boy

5545

5550
07:43:27,000 --> 07:43:31,000
I've never been to a school dance oh I guess maybe

5551
07:43:31,000 --> 07:43:35,000
not every country does it but we had to learn like

5552
07:43:35,000 --> 07:43:39,000
Scottish traditional dance like the gay garden did you say the gay garden

5553
07:43:39,000 --> 07:43:43,000
yes gay isn't happy ha ha ha we get it we're

5554
07:43:43,000 --> 07:43:47,000
called gay garden which means happy dance

5555
07:43:47,000 --> 07:43:51,000
never been to a school dance can't relate

5556
07:43:51,000 --> 07:43:55,000
I have hyperdologists too so I'm constantly dehydrated

5557
07:43:55,000 --> 07:43:59,000
had school dance here in New Zealand it was similar

5558
07:43:59,000 --> 07:44:03,000

5559
07:44:03,000 --> 07:44:07,000

I

5563
07:44:19,000 --> 07:44:23,000
what would I hate to receive

5564
07:44:23,000 --> 07:44:27,000
I don't know nothing really

5565
07:44:27,000 --> 07:44:31,000
I don't know nothing really

5566
07:44:31,000 --> 07:44:35,000

5567
07:44:35,000 --> 07:44:39,000
I don't know maybe like ask me to finish a game I didn't finish or something

5568
07:44:39,000 --> 07:44:43,000

5571
07:44:51,000 --> 07:44:55,000
me I think the force this is

5572
07:44:55,000 --> 07:44:59,000
some sad dances at some point in primary middle I went to a school

5573
07:44:59,000 --> 07:45:03,000
dance but there was not a specific dance I had to learn ah never went

5574
07:45:03,000 --> 07:45:07,000
to a dance but always to the after party ooh ballin

5575
07:45:07,000 --> 07:45:11,000
everyone quick tried to get under her skin why would you want under my skin

5576
07:45:11,000 --> 07:45:15,000
you'd rather be

5577
07:45:15,000 --> 07:45:19,000
I would say in it but hold on a minute that doesn't sound right

5578
07:45:19,000 --> 07:45:23,000
well hold on a minute there

5579
07:45:23,000 --> 07:45:27,000
you suck at Skyrim

5580
07:45:27,000 --> 07:45:31,000
when you're gonna finish it oh oh you've got me

5581
07:45:31,000 --> 07:45:35,000
oh tell me how bad I am at the RDA side oh

5582
07:45:35,000 --> 07:45:39,000
oh you've got me I can't believe it right I should probably drink my tea and then we'll jump back

5583
07:45:39,000 --> 07:45:43,000
into Skyrim that's right the tunes are on tunes are on

5584
07:45:43,000 --> 07:45:47,000
mm okay I'm hydrating I'm hydrating

5585
07:45:47,000 --> 07:45:51,000
mm-hmm

5586
07:45:51,000 --> 07:45:55,000
mm-hmm

5587
07:45:55,000 --> 07:45:59,000
she doesn't even know how to chase the RDA oh you've got me I didn't know to put the

5588
07:45:59,000 --> 07:46:03,000
grenade launcher on oh who would have thought

5589
07:46:03,000 --> 07:46:07,000
a grenade launcher

5590
07:46:07,000 --> 07:46:11,000
I can't believe it I'm being I'm being dunked on

5591
07:46:11,000 --> 07:46:15,000
ah

5592
07:46:15,000 --> 07:46:19,000
I would probably say the thing that would genuinely upset me the most

5593
07:46:19,000 --> 07:46:23,000
is if someone sent me something nasty about the daughters

5594
07:46:23,000 --> 07:46:27,000
and obviously if that starts appearing in the inbox

5595
07:46:27,000 --> 07:46:31,000
I know it's like not to pay heed but it's probably the worst thing I can

5596
07:46:31,000 --> 07:46:35,000
imagine but I would then again it was like well you're subjecting me to

5597
07:46:35,000 --> 07:46:39,000
not them so yeah

5598
07:46:39,000 --> 07:46:43,000
that's what it is

5599
07:46:43,000 --> 07:46:47,000
I like how she goes idle she hitting my eyes

5600
07:46:47,000 --> 07:46:51,000
well it's actually for hunting

5601
07:46:51,000 --> 07:46:55,000
but I think it can be used for a distraction

5602
07:46:55,000 --> 07:46:59,000
as well before I ink on you I just ink on you and run away like what you're gonna do

5603
07:46:59,000 --> 07:47:03,000
about it literally before you can even react I'm already gone

5604
07:47:03,000 --> 07:47:07,000
eh

5605
07:47:07,000 --> 07:47:11,000
do you ever play a follow game do you go for stats or stay list oh stats

5606
07:47:11,000 --> 07:47:15,000
I absolutely cannot for the life of me

5607
07:47:15,000 --> 07:47:19,000

5613
07:47:39,000 --> 07:47:43,000

5633
07:48:59,000 --> 07:49:03,000

5634
07:49:03,000 --> 07:49:07,000
alright just use my sleeve she certainly started my thing

5635
07:49:07,000 --> 07:49:11,000
I lost my twin sister a while back

5636
07:49:11,000 --> 07:49:15,000
how did you manage to finish that early

5637
07:49:15,000 --> 07:49:19,000
mmm you know

5638
07:49:19,000 --> 07:49:23,000
guys aren't the only one that might have a bit of the

5639
07:49:23,000 --> 07:49:27,000
preem

5640
07:49:27,000 --> 07:49:31,000
I'm a bit of a fiend for it

5641
07:49:31,000 --> 07:49:35,000
so

5642
07:49:35,000 --> 07:49:39,000
it is what it is I can't get this quest started

5643
07:49:39,000 --> 07:49:43,000
don't want to do that one retrieve the

5644
07:49:43,000 --> 07:49:47,000
sure we can do that we'll go retrieve the glove whilst we get the courier to

5645
07:49:47,000 --> 07:49:51,000
do his thing the glove the horn

5646
07:49:51,000 --> 07:49:55,000
how much would you guys pay for that hoodie

5647
07:49:55,000 --> 07:49:59,000
the convention I'll snot on it for free just bring grass pollen

5648
07:49:59,000 --> 07:50:03,000
or flowers and I'll be sneezing away I'm like really allergic

5649
07:50:03,000 --> 07:50:07,000
to that stuff can't go outside

5650
07:50:07,000 --> 07:50:11,000
which is funny because I have like a seed collection

5651
07:50:11,000 --> 07:50:15,000
which I really enjoy but of course seeds don't have pollen issues on them

5652
07:50:15,000 --> 07:50:19,000
although collecting them sometimes can have traces of pollen but it's not really a big deal

5653
07:50:19,000 --> 07:50:23,000
like if you know what you're doing

5654
07:50:23,000 --> 07:50:27,000
okay okay okay our first dragon

5655
07:50:27,000 --> 07:50:31,000
come land okay it's just a basic dragon

5656
07:50:31,000 --> 07:50:35,000
please land please land

5657
07:50:35,000 --> 07:50:39,000
oh

5658
07:50:39,000 --> 07:50:43,000
of course it resisted soul trap it's a dragon

5659
07:50:43,000 --> 07:50:47,000
I'm the freaking soul gem for the dragon

5660
07:50:47,000 --> 07:50:51,000
I don't know why we're pretending otherwise

5661
07:50:51,000 --> 07:50:55,000
hold on

5662
07:50:55,000 --> 07:50:59,000
I had just emptied like all of my inventory only to pick

5663
07:50:59,000 --> 07:51:03,000
all of that up again

5664
07:51:03,000 --> 07:51:07,000
that was quite a reaction wait what did I do

5665
07:51:07,000 --> 07:51:11,000
did I make a funny seed collection yeah you didn't see my

5666
07:51:11,000 --> 07:51:15,000
stream yesterday I showed off my seed collection I like when I

5667
07:51:15,000 --> 07:51:19,000
were in mud crab down

5668
07:51:19,000 --> 07:51:23,000
I obliterated that dragon's one ankle I know

5669
07:51:23,000 --> 07:51:27,000
I smashed it into dust and he was like okay I'm done I'm done here

5670
07:51:27,000 --> 07:51:31,000
hmm

5671
07:51:31,000 --> 07:51:35,000
wow that was really easy what a bad dragon

07:51:55,000 --> 07:51:59,000
air, hook, berry

5711
07:54:11,000 --> 07:54:15,000
so captured that is a

5712
07:54:15,000 --> 07:54:19,000
okay I never made it in time but that's okay

5713
07:54:19,000 --> 07:54:23,000
you can just go this way if you really don't want to do the fight

5714
07:54:23,000 --> 07:54:27,000
Lydia should actually clean up any enemies

5715
07:54:27,000 --> 07:54:31,000
oh I'm getting so many soul gems

5716
07:54:31,000 --> 07:54:35,000
we're gonna make so much money selling all the enchanted jewellery

5717
07:54:35,000 --> 07:54:39,000
what's going on in here

5718
07:54:39,000 --> 07:54:43,000
I can never remember I think there's something back there

5719
07:54:43,000 --> 07:54:47,000
I hit

5720
07:54:47,000 --> 07:54:51,000
oh my god I'm getting so many fricking soul

5721
07:54:51,000 --> 07:54:55,000
might as well call this game Jart please

5722
07:54:55,000 --> 07:54:59,000
what's that one do

5723
07:54:59,000 --> 07:55:03,000
I don't even remember the odds literally the very thing that I'm here for

5724
07:55:03,000 --> 07:55:07,000
well not here for because I'm actually doing a quest but

5725
07:55:07,000 --> 07:55:11,000
sure take the darker

5726
07:55:11,000 --> 07:55:15,000
200 feels so good literally

5727
07:55:15,000 --> 07:55:19,000
right so I can enchant this possibly

5728
07:55:19,000 --> 07:55:23,000
with soul trap and then give it a

5729
07:55:23,000 --> 07:55:27,000
greater soul gem greater

5730
07:55:27,000 --> 07:55:31,000
and then the other stuff will just shove anything on it

5731
07:55:31,000 --> 07:55:35,000
doesn't really matter as long as we just get some

5732
07:55:35,000 --> 07:55:39,000
XP yeah we're at 44 already

5733
07:55:39,000 --> 07:55:43,000
which is fantastic

5734
07:55:43,000 --> 07:55:47,000
just shoving anything on it

5735
07:55:47,000 --> 07:55:51,000
and these are worth a lot so as our

5736
07:55:51,000 --> 07:55:55,000
speech goes up we get even more money as time goes on

5737
07:55:55,000 --> 07:55:59,000
okay

5738
07:55:59,000 --> 07:56:03,000

5739
07:56:03,000 --> 07:56:07,000

5849
08:03:23,000 --> 08:03:27,000
one once was a hero named ragnar the red

5850
08:03:27,000 --> 08:03:31,000
who came riding to white run from horde warwick said

5851
08:03:31,000 --> 08:03:35,000
oh for goodness sakes shush

there is no possible goal that he made

5853
08:03:39,000 --> 08:03:43,000
but when he went quiet did ragnar the red

5854
08:03:43,000 --> 08:03:47,000
shield maiden Matilda who said

5855
08:03:47,000 --> 08:03:51,000
oh you talk and you lie and you drink or meet

5856
08:03:51,000 --> 08:03:55,000

5857
08:03:55,000 --> 08:03:59,000
slashing of steel is the brave last Matilda

5858
08:03:59,000 --> 08:04:03,000

he yanked it and then submitted it as his own

5873
08:04:59,000 --> 08:05:03,000

5882
08:05:35,000 --> 08:05:39,000

5883
08:05:39,000 --> 08:05:43,000

5884
08:05:43,000 --> 08:05:47,000

we're to perish one of them to fulfill a contract

5927
08:08:35,000 --> 08:08:39,000

5929
08:08:43,000 --> 08:08:47,000
it's alright just tell me what I need to know

5930
08:08:47,000 --> 08:08:51,000
I'm a woman living in Skyrim with six children and no husband

5931
08:08:51,000 --> 08:08:55,000
I don't have the time of the patience to be nine

5932
08:08:55,000 --> 08:08:59,000

5933
08:08:59,000 --> 08:09:03,000

we're currently doing the dark brotherhood quest

5937
08:09:15,000 --> 08:09:19,000
maybe you are your own child

5938
08:09:19,000 --> 08:09:23,000
obtainer of goods

5939
08:09:23,000 --> 08:09:27,000
why would you admit that

5940
08:09:27,000 --> 08:09:31,000
and would someone pay to

5941
08:09:31,000 --> 08:09:35,000
have you killed vasha

5942
08:09:35,000 --> 08:09:39,000
come on you can tell me

5943
08:09:39,000 --> 08:09:43,000
we're all friends here

5944
08:09:43,000 --> 08:09:47,000
the real question is would someone pay to have me killed

5945
08:09:47,000 --> 08:09:51,000
again

5946
08:09:51,000 --> 08:09:55,000
8 day goes by without someone trying

5947
08:09:55,000 --> 08:09:59,000
this reminds me of my dungeon

5948
08:09:59,000 --> 08:10:03,000
this place reminds me of the dungeon the blood everywhere and all the cages and things

5949
08:10:03,000 --> 08:10:07,000
right if you don't know who to

5950
08:10:07,000 --> 08:10:11,000
perish I'm gonna show you a trick

5951
08:10:11,000 --> 08:10:15,000

5952
08:10:15,000 --> 08:10:19,000

5953
08:10:19,000 --> 08:10:23,000
am I going crazy

5954
08:10:23,000 --> 08:10:27,000
does that not

5955
08:10:27,000 --> 08:10:31,000

5956
08:10:31,000 --> 08:10:35,000
did that it leads to the guy

5957
08:10:35,000 --> 08:10:39,000

08:10:43,000 --> 08:10:47,000

phone hold it right now in your hand hold it in your hand right now

5961
08:10:51,000 --> 08:10:55,000
hold pause

5962
08:10:55,000 --> 08:10:59,000
there that's how you know who you're supposed to kill

5963
08:10:59,000 --> 08:11:03,000
now it doesn't actually matter who you kill as long as someone

5964
08:11:03,000 --> 08:11:07,000
perishes but there you go

5965
08:11:07,000 --> 08:11:11,000
that's how you know who you're

5966
08:11:11,000 --> 08:11:15,000
supposed to perish

5967
08:11:15,000 --> 08:11:19,000
that was sure to have enemies

5968
08:11:19,000 --> 08:11:23,000
remain silent we know we did right

5969
08:11:23,000 --> 08:11:27,000
when most would speak you listen

5970
08:11:27,000 --> 08:11:31,000
you understand that the only thing that matters is you following my orders

5971
08:11:31,000 --> 08:11:35,000
to kill

5972
08:11:35,000 --> 08:11:39,000
you could perish Astrid oh no so I'm free to go

5973
08:11:39,000 --> 08:11:43,000

5974
08:11:43,000 --> 08:11:47,000

5976
08:11:51,000 --> 08:11:55,000
I would like to officially extend to you

5977
08:11:55,000 --> 08:11:59,000
an invitation to join my family

5978
08:11:59,000 --> 08:12:03,000
in the southwest reaches of Skyrim

5979
08:12:03,000 --> 08:12:07,000
in the pine forest you'll find the entrance to our sanctuary

5980
08:12:07,000 --> 08:12:11,000

5981
08:12:11,000 --> 08:12:15,000

08:12:15,000 --> 08:12:19,000

6030
08:15:27,000 --> 08:15:31,000
the armor of the dark brotherhood

6031
08:15:31,000 --> 08:15:35,000

6032
08:15:35,000 --> 08:15:39,000

my mom and papa left me all alone

6040
08:16:07,000 --> 08:16:11,000
and I'm so very hungry

6041
08:16:11,000 --> 08:16:15,000
I know a shortcut to the candy shop through the valley

6042
08:16:15,000 --> 08:16:19,000

6043
08:16:19,000 --> 08:16:23,000

6045
08:16:27,000 --> 08:16:31,000
I'm not that tall I'm not that short

6046
08:16:31,000 --> 08:16:35,000
you think I'm that small compared to everyone

6047
08:16:35,000 --> 08:16:39,000
oh yes please old man

6048
08:16:39,000 --> 08:16:43,000
let me see the dark brotherhood can help me

6049
08:16:43,000 --> 08:16:47,000
always mocking the experience

6050
08:16:47,000 --> 08:16:51,000
my contract went very well

6051
08:16:51,000 --> 08:16:55,000
wait I was either the wrong way around

6052
08:16:55,000 --> 08:16:59,000
this close to turning that priest inside out

6053
08:16:59,000 --> 08:17:03,000
damn messy

6054
08:17:03,000 --> 08:17:07,000
what of your latest armbion

6055
08:17:07,000 --> 08:17:11,000
something about a khajiit merchant

6056
08:17:11,000 --> 08:17:15,000
oh a big dog you say something I'm not kidding

6057
08:17:15,000 --> 08:17:19,000
how adorable

6058
08:17:19,000 --> 08:17:23,000
he's even in the workplace

6059
08:17:23,000 --> 08:17:27,000
he wasn't a merchant he was a khajiit monk

6060
08:17:27,000 --> 08:17:31,000
a master of the whispering fang style

6061
08:17:31,000 --> 08:17:35,000
I think it may not be on scale

6062
08:17:35,000 --> 08:17:39,000
workplace bullying

6063
08:17:39,000 --> 08:17:43,000
can't wait to have to go to HR and report all of that

6064
08:17:43,000 --> 08:17:47,000
we learned

6065
08:17:47,000 --> 08:17:51,000
per kill mark of death

6066
08:17:51,000 --> 08:17:55,000
swindling dysfunction

6067
08:17:55,000 --> 08:17:59,000
a little family

6068
08:17:59,000 --> 08:18:03,000
toxic work environment love

6069
08:18:03,000 --> 08:18:07,000
you will hear even more I assure you

6070
08:18:07,000 --> 08:18:11,000
I wish I had one I'm sorry

6071
08:18:11,000 --> 08:18:15,000
I like to unize you

6072
08:18:15,000 --> 08:18:19,000
but who knows I've been proven wrong before

6073
08:18:19,000 --> 08:18:23,000
Astra said you've got some work for me

6074
08:18:23,000 --> 08:18:27,000
nah?

6075
08:18:27,000 --> 08:18:31,000
loin cloth sniff

6076
08:18:31,000 --> 08:18:35,000
dribbling in from time to time

6077
08:18:35,000 --> 08:18:39,000
wait what you don't have one wait you have one

6078
08:18:39,000 --> 08:18:43,000
since simple enough

6079
08:18:43,000 --> 08:18:47,000
these aren't particularly glamorous assassinations I'll be honest

6080
08:18:47,000 --> 08:18:51,000
don't pay much either but they'll keep you busy

6081
08:18:51,000 --> 08:18:55,000
just do them as you're able there's no real time limit

6082
08:18:55,000 --> 08:18:59,000
the targets aren't going anywhere

6083
08:18:59,000 --> 08:19:03,000
the targets aren't going anywhere

6084
08:19:03,000 --> 08:19:07,000
okay

6085
08:19:07,000 --> 08:19:11,000
okay

6086
08:19:11,000 --> 08:19:15,000

6091
08:19:31,000 --> 08:19:35,000
probably gonna miss the end of the stream goodnight

6092
08:19:35,000 --> 08:19:39,000
I am just doing

6093
08:19:39,000 --> 08:19:43,000
be the brotherhood yeah

6094
08:19:43,000 --> 08:19:47,000
and then

6095
08:19:47,000 --> 08:19:51,000
where are you just gonna go to freaking dawn star

6096
08:19:51,000 --> 08:19:55,000
yeah we're not really doing anything

6097
08:19:55,000 --> 08:19:59,000
so please don't worry about going to sleep

6098
08:19:59,000 --> 08:20:03,000
what

6099
08:20:03,000 --> 08:20:07,000
okay

6100
08:20:07,000 --> 08:20:11,000
okay

6101
08:20:11,000 --> 08:20:15,000
wait what does it say

6102
08:20:15,000 --> 08:20:19,000
oh consider adoption wanted a good home

6103
08:20:19,000 --> 08:20:23,000
in these days of born strife the orphans of skyrim are the true victims many have no one left

6104
08:20:23,000 --> 08:20:27,000
to turn to and face the life of hard labour poverty and misery

6105
08:20:27,000 --> 08:20:31,000
if you could provide a stable home from one of these innocent children please consider adoption

6106
08:20:31,000 --> 08:20:35,000
so adopt from us or take in someone closer to home

6107
08:20:35,000 --> 08:20:39,000
you can make a difference in a child's life for more information inquire within

6108
08:20:39,000 --> 08:20:43,000
Constance Michelle Honorary Hall Riften

6109
08:20:43,000 --> 08:20:47,000
okay that is a very nice note she definitely is taking

6110
08:20:47,000 --> 08:20:51,000
care of those children a bit more

6111
08:20:51,000 --> 08:20:55,000
yes we are just going for a cheeky stab

6112
08:20:55,000 --> 08:20:59,000
there should be someone in a tent over here

6113
08:20:59,000 --> 08:21:03,000
um

6114
08:21:03,000 --> 08:21:07,000
I don't know if we could

6115
08:21:07,000 --> 08:21:11,000
I could have sworn you can speak to this person and they recognize you as someone from the dark brotherhood

6116
08:21:11,000 --> 08:21:15,000
but they don't do anything about it I'm like 99% sure

6117
08:21:15,000 --> 08:21:19,000
why are you here get away from me

6118
08:21:19,000 --> 08:21:23,000
you are right to be paranoid

6119
08:21:23,000 --> 08:21:27,000
oh

6120
08:21:27,000 --> 08:21:31,000
oh shit I missed

6121
08:21:31,000 --> 08:21:35,000
wait hold on

6122
08:21:35,000 --> 08:21:39,000
okay maybe I thought he didn't run away

6123
08:21:39,000 --> 08:21:43,000
but I guess he did right how do I get to

6124
08:21:43,000 --> 08:21:47,000
I'll just take I'll just go westward from here

6125
08:21:47,000 --> 08:21:51,000
time to adopt six children for gender oops

6126
08:21:51,000 --> 08:21:55,000
let's not talk about gender

6127
08:21:55,000 --> 08:21:59,000
oh no

6128
08:21:59,000 --> 08:22:03,000
I love that actively

6129
08:22:03,000 --> 08:22:07,000
I love that actively when you talk like when you do stuff in Skyrim

6130
08:22:07,000 --> 08:22:11,000
like the NPCs kind of discuss it I think that's such

6131
08:22:11,000 --> 08:22:15,000
a cool little detail I have to admit for a game for a game

6132
08:22:15,000 --> 08:22:19,000
that came out in 2011 and was produced like before that

6133
08:22:19,000 --> 08:22:23,000
that's pretty that's pretty decent you know

6134
08:22:23,000 --> 08:22:27,000
are you gonna give it to them sometimes can't can't give them all the credit

6135
08:22:27,000 --> 08:22:31,000
but you gotta give it to them sometimes unfortunately I believe we

6136
08:22:31,000 --> 08:22:35,000
do we have to go south no we don't I'm just taking

6137
08:22:35,000 --> 08:22:39,000
super long obnoxious way so I'm going to teleport back

6138
08:22:39,000 --> 08:22:43,000
and then I'm basically just gonna go along the war's edge to get to this dawn star

6139
08:22:43,000 --> 08:22:47,000
death is highly over here

6140
08:22:47,000 --> 08:22:51,000
infamous last words

6141
08:22:51,000 --> 08:22:55,000
so warhammer stuff literally oh you didn't see it coming

6142
08:22:55,000 --> 08:22:59,000
just imagine how cool Skyrim 2 will be

6143
08:22:59,000 --> 08:23:03,000
um did they even

6144
08:23:03,000 --> 08:23:07,000

6145
08:23:07,000 --> 08:23:11,000
get down oh I've not just done that have I

6146
08:23:11,000 --> 08:23:15,000
that'll be fine that'll be fine on the old ankles right

6147
08:23:15,000 --> 08:23:19,000
maybe this will do yeah easy easy just edge it a little bit

6148
08:23:19,000 --> 08:23:23,000
nice and slow slowly

6149
08:23:23,000 --> 08:23:27,000
slower good boy

6150
08:23:27,000 --> 08:23:31,000

08:23:31,000 --> 08:23:35,000
you shouldn't ache me on either

6152
08:23:35,000 --> 08:23:39,000
Elder Scrolls 6 is in development

they hardly freaking talk about the damn thing I can't

6155
08:23:47,000 --> 08:23:51,000
oh my god literally it's too easy the problem is you give me too

6156
08:23:51,000 --> 08:23:55,000
much power and then I get high on it and I just do it all the time

6157
08:23:55,000 --> 08:23:59,000
I'm not being funny that girl gave me far too much power

6158
08:23:59,000 --> 08:24:03,000

6159
08:24:03,000 --> 08:24:07,000

6168
08:24:39,000 --> 08:24:43,000
sorry I am I am going to redirect into

6169
08:24:43,000 --> 08:24:47,000
mercy because unfortunately my achievements bugged out so

6170
08:24:47,000 --> 08:24:51,000
it kind of may or may not have defeated the whole purpose of this achievement

6171
08:24:51,000 --> 08:24:55,000
uh run uh man we keep running into Talos

6172
08:24:55,000 --> 08:24:59,000

08:25:23,000 --> 08:25:27,000
what do you mean the Scottish accent is not making you cringe at your boots

6180
08:25:27,000 --> 08:25:31,000
what do you mean truly truly too much power

6181
08:25:31,000 --> 08:25:35,000
Talos no see I'm literally I'm walking into Talos

6182
08:25:35,000 --> 08:25:39,000
with north west so I can't even

6183
08:25:39,000 --> 08:25:43,000
talk I'm getting flustered thinking there's a girl watching me with a

6184
08:25:43,000 --> 08:25:47,000
fuck okay right I'm just going to converse this straight off the bat

6185
08:25:47,000 --> 08:25:51,000
so I used to play Call of Duty and whenever there was like a girl on my team I used to get really

6186
08:25:51,000 --> 08:25:55,000
flustered and I couldn't even talk properly I don't know why I just like completely

6187
08:25:55,000 --> 08:25:59,000
clam up and I'm just like uh uh uh and I just get really like freaking terrible

6188
08:25:59,000 --> 08:26:03,000
about it so it's really I don't know why I still haven't come over

6189
08:26:03,000 --> 08:26:07,000
yet because I played a few rounds of valorant and it happened there was a girl on my team and I

6190
08:26:07,000 --> 08:26:11,000
couldn't speak at all and voice chat and I don't know what it is

6191
08:26:11,000 --> 08:26:15,000
and it's not even like I'm trying to like impress her or anything I just like get all weird

6192
08:26:15,000 --> 08:26:19,000
and like I don't want to bother her you know I'm being weirdo

6193
08:26:19,000 --> 08:26:23,000
I'm like it's not like I'm trying to like

6194
08:26:23,000 --> 08:26:27,000
pick someone up or anything and I'm like freaking Call of Duty I don't know why I get all clammed up

6195
08:26:27,000 --> 08:26:31,000
and it's happening it's literally happening right now in live stream and I'm like oh my god now everyone knows I'm a weirdo

6196
08:26:31,000 --> 08:26:35,000
and I'm like uh I'm freaking talking to wham this hard

6197
08:26:35,000 --> 08:26:39,000
better not better not speaking and starting

6198
08:26:39,000 --> 08:26:43,000
to say bad jokes she's just like the majority of guys

6199
08:26:43,000 --> 08:26:47,000
clamming up like basically every other

6200
08:26:47,000 --> 08:26:51,000
cod player of honestly

6201
08:26:51,000 --> 08:26:55,000
girls are steering

6202
08:26:55,000 --> 08:26:59,000
wait until she really so the reason

6203
08:26:59,000 --> 08:27:03,000
why it feels like it's different for valorant girls is because

6204
08:27:03,000 --> 08:27:07,000
like I'm not trying to

6205
08:27:07,000 --> 08:27:11,000
I'm not like trying to

6206
08:27:11,000 --> 08:27:15,000
you know get anything out of them no that sounds really odd that makes it sound like

6207
08:27:15,000 --> 08:27:19,000
I'm freaking honing in that sounds really odd hold on

6208
08:27:19,000 --> 08:27:23,000
hold on let me think anything

6209
08:27:23,000 --> 08:27:27,000
I can't imagine anything bad happening if we give one person all the power

6210
08:27:27,000 --> 08:27:31,000
thank you for the don't know iron reaper

6213
08:27:39,000 --> 08:27:43,000

6214
08:27:43,000 --> 08:27:47,000
scrawny clamming up

6215
08:27:47,000 --> 08:27:51,000
if speaking to women is hard then you sure are very talented at it

6216
08:27:51,000 --> 08:27:55,000
well I'm like freaking my hands are sweating now and I'm getting my

6217
08:27:55,000 --> 08:27:59,000
faces all red it's burning off I can feel it and I'm like oh my god I need to like

6225
08:28:33,000 --> 08:28:37,000
based off of yesterday's stream most of us can probably give you the tip

6226
08:28:37,000 --> 08:28:41,000
honestly didn't you say that your hands are always sweating

6227
08:28:41,000 --> 08:28:45,000
yes but I am I do have physical reactions

6228
08:28:45,000 --> 08:28:49,000
to like stressors and it can make them sweat even more my left hand is currently

6229
08:28:49,000 --> 08:28:53,000
soaked and my right hand I'm like touching my face

6230
08:28:53,000 --> 08:28:57,000

6234
08:29:09,000 --> 08:29:13,000
yes right what was I saying

6235
08:29:13,000 --> 08:29:17,000
right cause the violour girls are like

6236
08:29:17,000 --> 08:29:21,000
it doesn't I don't have any it's not like I'm trying to do anything

6237
08:29:21,000 --> 08:29:25,000
I don't want to sound like I'm prederen

6238
08:29:25,000 --> 08:29:29,000
I can't freaking say a sentence anyway this is Skyrim it's a really good game it came out in 20

6239
08:29:29,000 --> 08:29:33,000
actually came out on November the 11th 2011

6240
08:29:33,000 --> 08:29:37,000
which is release date was 11 11 11 11

6241
08:29:37,000 --> 08:29:41,000
which was really cool little tidbit if you didn't know

6242
08:29:41,000 --> 08:29:45,000
I'm getting absolutely trolled right now

6243
08:29:45,000 --> 08:29:49,000
anyway

6244
08:29:49,000 --> 08:29:53,000
hi what do you want nothing I don't want anything

6245
08:29:57,000 --> 08:30:01,000
wait oh I got bounty added to me that's not good

6246
08:30:01,000 --> 08:30:05,000
that means the guards are always going to come up to me unless I clear the bounty

6247
08:30:05,000 --> 08:30:09,000
could you imagine you could start short

6248
08:30:09,000 --> 08:30:13,000
well that's why the plastic on like the controller in that is really good

6249
08:30:13,000 --> 08:30:17,000
for that issue I got seen

6250
08:30:17,000 --> 08:30:21,000
I fear for the girl refuelling

6251
08:30:21,000 --> 08:30:25,000
oh I see I didn't know you were there

6252
08:30:25,000 --> 08:30:29,000
oh my gosh I see that was terrifying

6253
08:30:29,000 --> 08:30:33,000
weee

6254
08:30:33,000 --> 08:30:37,000
this is the riskiest thing I've ever done do not go down a waterfall

6255
08:30:37,000 --> 08:30:41,000
whatever you do by the way that's a terrible choice right

6256
08:30:41,000 --> 08:30:45,000
can I teleport back to Mazeem

6257
08:30:45,000 --> 08:30:49,000
I can are you still playing on legendary yes I am

6258
08:30:49,000 --> 08:30:53,000
I never was not playing legendary at any point

6259
08:30:53,000 --> 08:30:57,000
I can show you again if you want

6260
08:30:57,000 --> 08:31:01,000
look a little to the left okay it's really cute that you're getting flustered

6261
08:31:01,000 --> 08:31:05,000
over this when every time you speak makes me flustered

6262
08:31:05,000 --> 08:31:09,000
what was I saying

6263
08:31:09,000 --> 08:31:13,000
thank you for the tip Miss Morgan I appreciate it

6264
08:31:13,000 --> 08:31:17,000
what was I showing oh yeah I'm on legendary

6265
08:31:17,000 --> 08:31:21,000
look a little to the left see look see legendary

6266
08:31:21,000 --> 08:31:25,000
I've been on it the entire time

6267
08:31:25,000 --> 08:31:29,000
I don't know why anyone thinks I'm not on legendary for some reason the proof is right on screen right now

6268
08:31:29,000 --> 08:31:33,000
so it's rather odd

6269
08:31:33,000 --> 08:31:37,000
yeah see fair enough yeah

6270
08:31:37,000 --> 08:31:41,000
oh wait hold on oh look a little to the right again

6271
08:31:41,000 --> 08:31:45,000
where am I

6272
08:31:45,000 --> 08:31:49,000
oh I'm still running away from the guards the guards aren't chasing me

6273
08:31:49,000 --> 08:31:53,000
they can be I'm in the middle of a waterfall

6274
08:31:53,000 --> 08:31:57,000
the guards are chasing me

6275
08:31:57,000 --> 08:32:01,000
oh there's an in route let's go get the in route

6276
08:32:01,000 --> 08:32:05,000
thank you for the tip again Miss Morgan

6277
08:32:05,000 --> 08:32:09,000
I never doubt scrawny what you mean me

6278
08:32:09,000 --> 08:32:13,000
they have made legendary for scrawny specifically because the game was too easy

6279
08:32:13,000 --> 08:32:17,000
true true Andrea am I being

6280
08:32:17,000 --> 08:32:21,000
can I just teleport to my location

6281
08:32:21,000 --> 08:32:25,000
so I can progress with my campaign what is shooting bone

6282
08:32:25,000 --> 08:32:29,000
arrows at me is that Lydia is Lydia turned against me too

6283
08:32:29,000 --> 08:32:33,000
get me down the stream I'm a fish I'm actually a fish

6284
08:32:33,000 --> 08:32:37,000
get me this is literally what it looks like from the outside POV

6285
08:32:37,000 --> 08:32:41,000
you're just zooming down the rocks

6286
08:32:41,000 --> 08:32:45,000
can we teleport now

6287
08:32:45,000 --> 08:32:49,000
yes we can

6288
08:32:49,000 --> 08:32:53,000
she's just so good guys honestly

6289
08:32:53,000 --> 08:32:57,000
well I was going nope not at all

6290
08:32:57,000 --> 08:33:01,000
definitely a MLG gamer

6291
08:33:01,000 --> 08:33:05,000
and she tells you her problems because I'm so good literally I don't know why people seem to struggle

6292
08:33:05,000 --> 08:33:09,000
playing on legendary oh Cicero

6293
08:33:35,000 --> 08:33:39,000
are you squidding me right now

6294
08:33:39,000 --> 08:33:43,000
listen scrawny our Scots accent if one of few benefits of being Scottish

6295
08:33:43,000 --> 08:33:47,000
so use it to your advantage as much as you can

6296
08:33:47,000 --> 08:33:51,000
thank you for the tip Kitsune

6297
08:33:51,000 --> 08:33:55,000
use my Scottish accent to my advantage

6298
08:33:55,000 --> 08:33:59,000
even the night mother are of course welcome here Cicero

6299
08:33:59,000 --> 08:34:03,000
and you will be afforded the respect deserving of your position as keeper

6300
08:34:03,000 --> 08:34:07,000
understood

6301
08:34:07,000 --> 08:34:11,000
I think I may or may not be

6302
08:34:11,000 --> 08:34:15,000
rather submissive at the moment so I can't take a much to say

6303
08:34:15,000 --> 08:34:19,000
oh pardon me

6304
08:34:19,000 --> 08:34:23,000
putting out my weapon in the middle of a cutscene

6305
08:34:23,000 --> 08:34:27,000
I'll be clear on that point

6306
08:34:27,000 --> 08:34:31,000
oh yes mistress perfectly you're the boss

6307
08:34:31,000 --> 08:34:35,000
oh there you are

6308
08:34:35,000 --> 08:34:39,000
I was done speaking with that muttering fool anyway

6309
08:34:39,000 --> 08:34:43,000
we've got business to discuss do you have a contract for me

6310
08:34:43,000 --> 08:34:47,000
is this over for mash

6311
08:34:47,000 --> 08:34:51,000
and speak with the apothecaries assistant

6312
08:34:51,000 --> 08:34:55,000
you'll probably find her in the hags cure when the shoppers

6313
08:34:55,000 --> 08:34:59,000
why does Cicero sound like junk oh why would you say something like that

6314
08:34:59,000 --> 08:35:03,000
my name is Moeery

6315
08:35:03,000 --> 08:35:07,000
rip tie is ready to roll

6316
08:35:07,000 --> 08:35:11,000
I'll let you keep whatever Moeery pays

6317
08:35:11,000 --> 08:35:15,000
ah there you are

6318
08:35:15,000 --> 08:35:19,000
I was done speaking with that muttering fool

6319
08:35:19,000 --> 08:35:23,000
hello hello

6320
08:35:23,000 --> 08:35:27,000
it's good to meet you Cicero

6321
08:35:27,000 --> 08:35:31,000
just keep your distance Jester and we'll get along just fine it's good to meet you

6322
08:35:31,000 --> 08:35:35,000
so polite so nice Cicero likes you

6323
08:35:35,000 --> 08:35:39,000
the night mother is sure to like you too

6324
08:35:39,000 --> 08:35:43,000
oh we're going to be fast friends

6325
08:35:43,000 --> 08:35:47,000
why did you come to the sanctuary Cicero

6326
08:35:47,000 --> 08:35:51,000
the night mother's crypt in Bravil was

6327
08:35:51,000 --> 08:35:55,000
desecrated

6328
08:35:55,000 --> 08:35:59,000
my stripe nowhere there is safe at present

6329
08:35:59,000 --> 08:36:03,000
so Cicero brought our lady to her home

6330
08:36:03,000 --> 08:36:07,000
this is the only sanctuary left in all of Skye River

6331
08:36:07,000 --> 08:36:11,000
you see such was my

6332
08:36:11,000 --> 08:36:15,000
honour as keeper as keeper

6333
08:36:15,000 --> 08:36:19,000
how much did they spend on this freaking voice actor who's he nailed it

6334
08:36:19,000 --> 08:36:23,000
what are your duties of a keeper

6335
08:36:23,000 --> 08:36:27,000
look at yourself Cicero not about the night mother

6336
08:36:27,000 --> 08:36:31,000
or feeling submissive

6337
08:36:31,000 --> 08:36:35,000
you're such a good girl

6338
08:36:35,000 --> 08:36:39,000
thank you

6339
08:36:39,000 --> 08:36:43,000
oh Cicero was just the keeper

6340
08:36:43,000 --> 08:36:47,000
I look at love me

6341
08:36:47,000 --> 08:36:51,000
are you squidding me right now

6342
08:36:51,000 --> 08:36:55,000
would you like me more if I transitioned to a woman

6343
08:36:55,000 --> 08:36:59,000
have you got a pole

6344
08:36:59,000 --> 08:37:03,000
I want the pole if you've got a hole I want the hole

6345
08:37:03,000 --> 08:37:07,000
don't swap

6346
08:37:07,000 --> 08:37:11,000
you don't need a swap

6347
08:37:11,000 --> 08:37:15,000
the words

6348
08:37:19,000 --> 08:37:23,000
the listener what's a listener Cicero

6349
08:37:23,000 --> 08:37:27,000
the listener is the only person the night mother speaks to

6350
08:37:27,000 --> 08:37:31,000
Stroney's an equal opportunist are you squidding me right now

6351
08:37:31,000 --> 08:37:35,000
you dislike Cicero

6352
08:37:35,000 --> 08:37:39,000
oh you don't like his character

6353
08:37:39,000 --> 08:37:43,000
but inside the listener's head

6354
08:37:43,000 --> 08:37:47,000
I hear da but there has not been a listener in years and years

6355
08:37:47,000 --> 08:37:51,000
a lady has not chosen

6356
08:37:51,000 --> 08:37:55,000
I like to dislike Cicero

6357
08:37:55,000 --> 08:37:59,000
but Cicero's like trying to

6358
08:37:59,000 --> 08:38:03,000
stroney's such a good right you're done

6359
08:38:03,000 --> 08:38:07,000
collectively you're done

6360
08:38:07,000 --> 08:38:11,000
I was supposed to hand in the contract so I wasn't paying attention

6361
08:38:11,000 --> 08:38:15,000
thank you for the tip anonymous but no you got a pole keep the pole

6362
08:38:15,000 --> 08:38:19,000
don't be swapping stuff around

6363
08:38:19,000 --> 08:38:23,000
there's a whole other conversation that can come out of that

6364
08:38:23,000 --> 08:38:27,000
but we can't even get into that

6365
08:38:27,000 --> 08:38:31,000
we're going to very slowly hand over

6366
08:38:31,000 --> 08:38:35,000
all the freaking things

6367
08:38:35,000 --> 08:38:39,000
I love watching your long gaming sessions

6368
08:38:39,000 --> 08:38:43,000
that was lovely to be backdrop thank you for the tip I appreciate that

6369
08:38:43,000 --> 08:38:47,000
I'm glad I was worthy

6370
08:38:47,000 --> 08:38:51,000
to wait for after all this time

6371
08:38:51,000 --> 08:38:55,000
it had been a while

6372
08:38:55,000 --> 08:38:59,000
I have to make up for lost time

6373
08:38:59,000 --> 08:39:03,000
why do you want to eat me

6374
08:39:03,000 --> 08:39:07,000
I don't even thought about that

6375
08:39:07,000 --> 08:39:11,000
oh yeah I want to eat calamari

6376
08:39:11,000 --> 08:39:15,000
no you're not supposed to want to eat it

6377
08:39:15,000 --> 08:39:19,000
thank you for the tip pick one

6378
08:39:19,000 --> 08:39:23,000
I like how Lydia just respectfully hangs out

6379
08:39:23,000 --> 08:39:27,000
she's like yeah I'm not going to come in and solve my problem

6380
08:39:27,000 --> 08:39:31,000
thank you I appreciate it

6381
08:39:31,000 --> 08:39:35,000
there was a lot of

6382
08:39:35,000 --> 08:39:39,000
I don't know what the word is

6383
08:39:39,000 --> 08:39:43,000
I suppose emotional turmoil is a bit of a dramatic

6384
08:39:43,000 --> 08:39:47,000
lower

6385
08:39:47,000 --> 08:39:51,000
yeah I'm fine

6386
08:39:51,000 --> 08:39:55,000
he was shouting about the foreign swore

6387
08:39:55,000 --> 08:39:59,000
I think you dropped this

6388
08:39:59,000 --> 08:40:03,000
do you know anything

6389
08:40:03,000 --> 08:40:07,000
hello

6390
08:40:07,000 --> 08:40:11,000
the dark brother has come

6391
08:40:11,000 --> 08:40:15,000
we're here

6392
08:40:15,000 --> 08:40:19,000
I'd prefer it raw like sushi

6393
08:40:19,000 --> 08:40:23,000
we're not supposed to want to eat it

6394
08:40:23,000 --> 08:40:27,000
I'm glad because there was like

6395
08:40:27,000 --> 08:40:31,000
the emotional turmoil and a lot of bad memories came back to the surface

6396
08:40:31,000 --> 08:40:35,000
but they got completely manually overrated

6397
08:40:35,000 --> 08:40:39,000
just because of the love

6398
08:40:39,000 --> 08:40:43,000
and everything that we did

6399
08:40:43,000 --> 08:40:47,000
the girls and I couldn't have predicted anything at all

6400
08:40:47,000 --> 08:40:51,000
it was impossible to predict and we were dealing with

6401
08:40:51,000 --> 08:40:55,000
a major calling at the time which was really messing

6402
08:40:55,000 --> 08:40:59,000
with like how to predict anything at all

6403
08:40:59,000 --> 08:41:03,000
okay but what were we supposed to do with the fish

6404
08:41:03,000 --> 08:41:07,000
I can give explicit detail

6405
08:41:07,000 --> 08:41:11,000

wait did I read the map wrong

6413
08:41:39,000 --> 08:41:43,000
I think I might have read the map wrong

6414
08:41:43,000 --> 08:41:47,000
you hear about the story of a dude who put a fish in his pants

6415
08:41:47,000 --> 08:41:51,000
no I did not is this bad

6416
08:41:55,000 --> 08:41:59,000
am I supposed to perish her

6417
08:42:03,000 --> 08:42:07,000
she's so messed up are you okay

6418
08:42:07,000 --> 08:42:11,000
wait so why does

6419
08:42:11,000 --> 08:42:15,000
why does she have to be

6420
08:42:15,000 --> 08:42:19,000
cherished if it's optional I'm not actually going to do it because that's really mean

6421
08:42:23,000 --> 08:42:25,000
I have a perfect mean for the situation

6422
08:42:25,000 --> 08:42:29,000
cherish the fish worship the fish for all mortal positions

6423
08:42:29,000 --> 08:42:33,000
no that is nothing

6424
08:42:33,000 --> 08:42:37,000
why are you shooting

6425
08:42:37,000 --> 08:42:41,000
you've just attacked those bandits no wonder they're shooting

6426
08:42:41,000 --> 08:42:45,000
a little to the right

6427
08:42:45,000 --> 08:42:49,000
but I can forfeit the fish best I can forfeit to fish

6428
08:42:49,000 --> 08:42:53,000
no keep it

6429
08:42:53,000 --> 08:42:57,000
no give money to fish unless

6430
08:42:57,000 --> 08:43:01,000
is there even an unless

6431
08:43:01,000 --> 08:43:05,000
I don't even think there's really an unless in that scenario

6432
08:43:05,000 --> 08:43:09,000
it's not that one no it's up here

6433
08:43:09,000 --> 08:43:13,000
I'm not really sure if I'm going to be able to make it to this checkpoint

6434
08:43:13,000 --> 08:43:17,000
because I'm definitely not supposed to be coming up the sheer cliff face

6435
08:43:17,000 --> 08:43:21,000
of a mountain only give money if you can afford it

6436
08:43:21,000 --> 08:43:25,000
but even then I feel like there's so many attachments to it

6437
08:43:25,000 --> 08:43:29,000
and it's like only give it if you're financially stable only give it if you

6438
08:43:29,000 --> 08:43:33,000
are genuinely enjoying the content only give it if

6439
08:43:33,000 --> 08:43:37,000
you know you've treated yourself and

6440
08:43:37,000 --> 08:43:41,000
you've got savings and all that and you're looking after yourself like if you're

6441
08:43:41,000 --> 08:43:45,000

08:43:53,000 --> 08:43:57,000

think it's very important to consider

6470
08:45:37,000 --> 08:45:41,000
life experience as an XP bar and when you talk to people and when

6471
08:45:41,000 --> 08:45:45,000
you get to hear other perspectives you are very slowly filling up that bar

6472
08:45:45,000 --> 08:45:49,000
and one a very big life lesson

6473
08:45:49,000 --> 08:45:53,000
can be hold on

6474
08:45:53,000 --> 08:45:57,000

6479
08:46:13,000 --> 08:46:17,000

6481
08:46:21,000 --> 08:46:25,000

6483
08:46:29,000 --> 08:46:33,000
I can teach you guys about debt and how it works and how credit cards work

6484
08:46:33,000 --> 08:46:37,000
I genuinely believe credit cards are the absolute spawn of

6485
08:46:37,000 --> 08:46:41,000
Satan for lack of better words I absolutely

6486
08:46:41,000 --> 08:46:45,000

6491
08:47:01,000 --> 08:47:05,000
gee it's almost like the world runs if people are on debt because of the way

6492
08:47:05,000 --> 08:47:09,000

6581
08:53:01,000 --> 08:53:05,000

6582
08:53:05,000 --> 08:53:09,000
ah that's the roof

6583
08:53:09,000 --> 08:53:13,000
defiler

6584
08:53:13,000 --> 08:53:17,000
defiler

6585
08:53:17,000 --> 08:53:21,000
it's so good

6586
08:53:21,000 --> 08:53:25,000
speak worm

6587
08:53:25,000 --> 08:53:29,000
I feel like that doesn't speak worm

6588
08:53:29,000 --> 08:53:33,000
in my accent could you imagine I like catch you doing something

6589
08:53:33,000 --> 08:53:37,000

6591
08:53:41,000 --> 08:53:45,000
she said I am the one I am the one the only one don't need a gun

6592
08:53:45,000 --> 08:53:49,000
to get respect up off the streets

6593
08:53:49,000 --> 08:53:53,000
lie

6594
08:53:53,000 --> 08:53:57,000

6595
08:53:57,000 --> 08:54:01,000

08:54:01,000 --> 08:54:05,000

6597
08:54:09,000 --> 08:54:13,000
my worm simply inks why is he jelly

6598
08:54:13,000 --> 08:54:17,000
wait she said to tell you darkness rises when silence falls

6599
08:54:17,000 --> 08:54:21,000
darkness rises when silence dies

6600
08:54:21,000 --> 08:54:25,000
she said those words

6601
08:54:25,000 --> 08:54:29,000
darkness rises when silence dies

6602
08:54:29,000 --> 08:54:33,000
but those are the words

6603
08:54:33,000 --> 08:54:37,000
German walls are

6604
08:54:37,000 --> 08:54:41,000
25 to 30 centimeters thick

6605
08:54:41,000 --> 08:54:45,000

08:54:53,000 --> 08:54:57,000
she has chosen her listener

6609
08:54:57,000 --> 08:55:01,000
she has chosen you

6610
08:55:01,000 --> 08:55:05,000
why did that humming mumbling sound remain me of sea bat

6611
08:55:05,000 --> 08:55:09,000
I'm so sorry I hum it

6612
08:55:09,000 --> 08:55:13,000
tornado alley is a conspiracy theory it's just UFOs stealing houses

6613
08:55:13,000 --> 08:55:17,000
and the night for insurance

6614
08:55:17,000 --> 08:55:21,000
whatever you've been planning is over

6615
08:55:21,000 --> 08:55:25,000
are you alright I heard the commotion who is Cicero talking to

6616
08:55:25,000 --> 08:55:29,000
reveal yourself traitor

6617
08:55:29,000 --> 08:55:33,000
I spoke only to the night mother

6618
08:55:33,000 --> 08:55:37,000
I spoke to the night mother but she didn't speak to me

6619
08:55:37,000 --> 08:55:41,000
she's in a little jake he's adorable

6620
08:55:41,000 --> 08:55:45,000
what the listener

6621
08:55:45,000 --> 08:55:49,000
it's true

6622
08:55:49,000 --> 08:55:53,000
the night mother has spoken

6623
08:55:53,000 --> 08:55:57,000
the listener has been chosen

6624
08:55:57,000 --> 08:56:01,000
Cicero's infectious with how happy he is

6625
08:56:01,000 --> 08:56:05,000
Reflings it's chosen it's chosen

6626
08:56:05,000 --> 08:56:09,000
I feel the worst are you alright

6627
08:56:09,000 --> 08:56:13,000
yes I'm fine I don't know what happened so fast yet the band

6628
08:56:13,000 --> 08:56:17,000
Cicero spoke to the night mother but she spoke to you

6629
08:56:17,000 --> 08:56:21,000
is this just more of the fools rambling

6630
08:56:21,000 --> 08:56:25,000
it's true the night Miller spoke to me she said I was the one the only one don't need

6631
08:56:25,000 --> 08:56:29,000
a gun to get respect up off the streets my enemies your enemies

6632
08:56:29,000 --> 08:56:33,000
we wet them off like a canteen

6633
08:56:33,000 --> 08:56:37,000
sorry Cicero wasn't talking to anyone else just the night mother's body

6634
08:56:37,000 --> 08:56:41,000
no to night mother

6635
08:56:41,000 --> 08:56:45,000
I like the scottish version

6636
08:56:45,000 --> 08:56:49,000
I'm the one the only one don't need a gun to get respect up off the streets

6637
08:56:49,000 --> 08:56:53,000
my enemies your enemies we wet them off like a canteen

6638
08:56:53,000 --> 08:56:57,000
yeah you like that

6639
08:56:57,000 --> 08:57:01,000
I hope nothing bad happens to Cicero

6640
08:57:01,000 --> 08:57:05,000
I must speak to someone named Armand

6641
08:57:05,000 --> 08:57:09,000
Motieri

6642
08:57:09,000 --> 08:57:13,000
I have no idea who that is

6643
08:57:13,000 --> 08:57:17,000
that I have heard of and I know where it is

6644
08:57:17,000 --> 08:57:21,000
should I go should I talk to the man

6645
08:57:21,000 --> 08:57:25,000
no no listen

6646
08:57:25,000 --> 08:57:29,000
I don't know what's going on here but you take your orders from me

6647
08:57:29,000 --> 08:57:33,000
I'll be clear on that

6648
08:57:33,000 --> 08:57:37,000
I am still the leader of this family

6649
08:57:37,000 --> 08:57:41,000
you're so easily dismissed

6650
08:57:41,000 --> 08:57:45,000
I need time to think about all this

6651
08:57:45,000 --> 08:57:49,000
go see Nazir do some work for him

6652
08:57:49,000 --> 08:57:53,000
I'll find you when I'm ready to discuss the matter

6653
08:57:53,000 --> 08:57:57,000
oh you are the one who served mother well

6654
08:57:57,000 --> 08:58:01,000
I have

6655
08:58:01,000 --> 08:58:05,000

6658
08:58:13,000 --> 08:58:17,000
Astrid feels the power slipping away

6659
08:58:17,000 --> 08:58:21,000
yeah

6660
08:58:21,000 --> 08:58:25,000

6661
08:58:25,000 --> 08:58:29,000
but that was then this is now you're the listener and the night mother

6662
08:58:29,000 --> 08:58:33,000
chose you for a reason I'm sure Cicero will remain

6663
08:58:33,000 --> 08:58:37,000
aww

6664
08:58:37,000 --> 08:58:41,000

6665
08:58:41,000 --> 08:58:45,000

6666
08:58:45,000 --> 08:58:49,000
wait the listener is serious

6667
08:58:49,000 --> 08:58:53,000
sorry Cicero

6668
08:58:53,000 --> 08:58:57,000
well of course the night mother will speak to you again

6669
08:58:57,000 --> 08:59:01,000
she might speak now or later or I don't know

6670
08:59:01,000 --> 08:59:05,000
the night mother is part of you now

6671
08:59:05,000 --> 08:59:09,000
I'm not taking my man

6672
08:59:09,000 --> 08:59:13,000

6673
08:59:13,000 --> 08:59:17,000

you do be talking a lot those sisters

6680
08:59:41,000 --> 08:59:45,000
I think you're a bigger yapper than me and that's a hard title to

6681
08:59:45,000 --> 08:59:49,000
join off of me hi Nazir

6682
08:59:49,000 --> 08:59:53,000
sorry

6683
08:59:53,000 --> 08:59:57,000
Astrid wanted me to see you about some more work

6684
08:59:57,000 --> 09:00:01,000
what time is it

6685
09:00:01,000 --> 09:00:05,000
oh mercy's on

6686
09:00:05,000 --> 09:00:09,000
positive tunes

6687
09:00:09,000 --> 09:00:13,000

6688
09:00:13,000 --> 09:00:17,000
out with it woman

6689
09:00:17,000 --> 09:00:21,000
I'm going to see if I can fix these achievements

6690
09:00:21,000 --> 09:00:25,000
because there's really not a reason why they shouldn't be working

6691
09:00:25,000 --> 09:00:29,000
whatever tomorrow's stream is going to be

6692
09:00:29,000 --> 09:00:33,000
oh I can hear myself twice go away

6693
09:00:33,000 --> 09:00:37,000
is she live

6694
09:00:37,000 --> 09:00:41,000
what's she doing advice giving give me your troubles and I'll make them worse

6695
09:00:41,000 --> 09:00:45,000
that's honestly a hilarious concept

6696
09:00:45,000 --> 09:00:49,000
I might be doing that later down the line

6697
09:00:49,000 --> 09:00:53,000
I'm going to see if I can fix my achievements

6698
09:00:53,000 --> 09:00:57,000
that's not really the biggest thing issue ever

6699
09:00:57,000 --> 09:01:01,000
I will be

6700
09:01:01,000 --> 09:01:05,000
tomorrow I will be doing my monetization celebration stream

6701
09:01:05,000 --> 09:01:09,000
do I really have to make it $5

6702
09:01:09,000 --> 09:01:13,000
on the nose I really like the idea

6703
09:01:13,000 --> 09:01:17,000
it was $9.99 to support your wishy-dice but

6704
09:01:17,000 --> 09:01:21,000
why

6705
09:01:21,000 --> 09:01:25,000
oh my god no

6706
09:01:25,000 --> 09:01:29,000
true Seaf Guild master

6707
09:01:29,000 --> 09:01:33,000
thank you for the stream you're more than welcome thank you for hanging and I will redirect

6708
09:01:33,000 --> 09:01:37,000
into mercy

6709
09:01:37,000 --> 09:01:41,000
oh can you do a collab with the girls where you do a

6710
09:01:41,000 --> 09:01:45,000
round of terrible advice that would actually be quite funny I wouldn't mind

6711
09:01:45,000 --> 09:01:49,000
doing that

6712
09:01:49,000 --> 09:01:53,000
my collab is actually power washer sim where you get to see us all together

6713
09:01:53,000 --> 09:01:57,000
because someone not naming names, refling

6714
09:01:57,000 --> 09:02:01,000
guessed the entire reason why we're playing power washer first

6715
09:02:01,000 --> 09:02:05,000
out of all the games of course you had to figure out what the freaking plot was

6716
09:02:05,000 --> 09:02:09,000
but yes

6717
09:02:09,000 --> 09:02:13,000
I will see you giffy givers tomorrow brushing your teeth

6718
09:02:13,000 --> 09:02:17,000
oh I don't have my toothbrush here

6719
09:02:17,000 --> 09:02:21,000
I might like to do it tomorrow

6720
09:02:21,000 --> 09:02:25,000
I'll still work Matty's but we'll do it on stream tomorrow like after the

6721
09:02:25,000 --> 09:02:29,000
the foot part

6722
09:02:29,000 --> 09:02:33,000
but thank you so much for having me thank you for letting me do another

6723
09:02:33,000 --> 09:02:37,000
well it wasn't a fool endurance but it was almost a fool endurance it wasn't too bad

6724
09:02:37,000 --> 09:02:41,000
tomorrow is getting bulldozed

6725
09:02:41,000 --> 09:02:45,000
for monetization celebration so be there or be a square

6726
09:02:45,000 --> 09:02:49,000
I won't be up for too long definitely not an endurance stream

6727
09:02:49,000 --> 09:02:53,000
but please don't worry if you can't make it the void will remain up I will be

6728
09:02:53,000 --> 09:02:57,000
a good girl

6729
09:02:57,000 --> 09:03:01,000
just like you you'll be a good boy won't you

6730
09:03:01,000 --> 09:03:05,000
or a good girl

6731
09:03:05,000 --> 09:03:09,000
yeah only nine over a stream yeah just a little bit

6732
09:03:09,000 --> 09:03:13,000
but yes we will be good together and we don't need to worry

6733
09:03:13,000 --> 09:03:17,000
it should remain up

6734
09:03:17,000 --> 09:03:21,000
and I think that's everything I have to say

6735
09:03:21,000 --> 09:03:25,000
it's possible do we have to stagger our monetization

6736
09:03:25,000 --> 09:03:29,000
celebration days

6737
09:03:29,000 --> 09:03:33,000
or can I if I did two if I did two hours and then perfectly read into

6738
09:03:33,000 --> 09:03:37,000
she be yeah that's fine if she decides to do hers

6739
09:03:37,000 --> 09:03:41,000
as well because I'm not going to tell her not to do it you know

6740
09:03:41,000 --> 09:03:45,000
I'm not going to say no six hours shaking my head I'm such a fake

6741
09:03:45,000 --> 09:03:49,000
gamer I'm such a rubbish streamer nine hours

6742
09:03:49,000 --> 09:03:53,000
she said again okay I have to learn that being called a good boys

6743
09:03:53,000 --> 09:03:57,000
okay I've learned that being called a good boys move well it's supposed to make you weak in the

6744
09:03:57,000 --> 09:04:01,000
knees

6745
09:04:01,000 --> 09:04:05,000
for me it's simple okay you

6746
09:04:05,000 --> 09:04:09,000
behave you get rewarded

6747
09:04:09,000 --> 09:04:13,000
fair and simple exchange

6748
09:04:13,000 --> 09:04:17,000
oh you do have to go to 599 to avoid gifting

6749
09:04:17,000 --> 09:04:21,000
you're joking please tell me you're trolling me

6750
09:04:21,000 --> 09:04:25,000
and it's not 599

6751
09:04:25,000 --> 09:04:29,000
is it actually 599

6752
09:04:29,000 --> 09:04:33,000
I don't think I can charge that much that's not fair

6753
09:04:33,000 --> 09:04:37,000
mmm

6754
09:04:37,000 --> 09:04:41,000
mmm

6755
09:04:41,000 --> 09:04:45,000
why did gifting change does gifting not go to the lowest here

6756
09:04:45,000 --> 09:04:49,000
are we sure gifting doesn't do the lowest here

6757
09:04:49,000 --> 09:04:53,000
what's gifting so when someone is monetized

6758
09:04:53,000 --> 09:04:57,000
you can gift membership to other people and

6759
09:04:57,000 --> 09:05:01,000
um

6760
09:05:01,000 --> 09:05:05,000
I specifically am having you know what

6761
09:05:05,000 --> 09:05:09,000
we could test it on me

6762
09:05:09,000 --> 09:05:13,000
we could test it on me tomorrow

6763
09:05:13,000 --> 09:05:17,000
I know how to um dance the line

6764
09:05:17,000 --> 09:05:21,000
okay we'll test it on me tomorrow we'll see

6765
09:05:21,000 --> 09:05:25,000
what happens strongy street spot oh English strongy

6766
09:05:25,000 --> 09:05:29,000
speaks and my heart becomes weak 100% sure it doesn't

6767
09:05:29,000 --> 09:05:33,000
seen tons of channels with 199 split

6768
09:05:33,000 --> 09:05:37,000
let me let me cook

6769
09:05:37,000 --> 09:05:41,000
and I'll put the price that I want and I think it's fair and we'll see what happens

6770
09:05:41,000 --> 09:05:45,000
and if it's just an absolute cluster minuster then

6771
09:05:45,000 --> 09:05:49,000
we'll deal with a fallout on me at least and then the girls are unaffected

6772
09:05:49,000 --> 09:05:53,000
by any fallout

6773
09:05:53,000 --> 09:05:57,000
the fear of a thingy but I've never seen it happen

6774
09:05:57,000 --> 09:06:01,000
nah and it's like

6775
09:06:01,000 --> 09:06:05,000
I have to turn on being able to be gifted yes I would put it on because it's a big

6776
09:06:05,000 --> 09:06:09,000
income source and I have terrible news

6777
09:06:09,000 --> 09:06:13,000
I spent a lot of money

6778
09:06:13,000 --> 09:06:17,000
yeah failure wasn't cheap let's put it that way

6779
09:06:17,000 --> 09:06:21,000
yes not even fallout in new vegas

6780
09:06:21,000 --> 09:06:25,000
what about fallout in new vegas

6781
09:06:25,000 --> 09:06:29,000
I've seen 399 and 799 that's rubbish

6782
09:06:29,000 --> 09:06:33,000
if they use it they have to turn on being able to receive gifts

6783
09:06:33,000 --> 09:06:37,000
ok ok well that's a team effort

6784
09:06:37,000 --> 09:06:41,000
just a wee bit of money just a wee bit of pocket money

6785
09:06:41,000 --> 09:06:45,000
if so well

6786
09:06:45,000 --> 09:06:49,000
I will let you be carried away

6787
09:06:49,000 --> 09:06:53,000

6788
09:06:53,000 --> 09:06:57,000
