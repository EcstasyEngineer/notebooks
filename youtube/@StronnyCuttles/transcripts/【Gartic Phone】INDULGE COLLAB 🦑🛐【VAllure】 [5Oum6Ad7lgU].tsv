24000	26000	You two have been kind of lagging in terms of like moving alive.
26000	28000	Yeah, it takes like a hot second for me to even
28000	30000	appear.
30000	32000	Like when I hit.
32000	34000	Guys, guys, guys, it killed my broadcast room.
34000	36000	What?
36000	38000	You killed your broadcast room?

40000	42000	Like it suddenly like stopped streaming and then

56000	58000	My chat is laughing at us.
58000	60000	Chat, I'm so sorry.
60000	62000	Hello, everybody.
62000	64000	We're so professional.
64000	66000	It's been awful.
66000	68000	How many VLR members
68000	70000	do you need
70000	72000	to do a collab to properly
72000	74000	do a collab to properly.
74000	76000	Merci. Well, I'll meet you in your room.
78000	80000	Yay, she might need a new room.
80000	82000	Hold on.
82000	84000	I'm just eating arrows called
84000	86000	leche live in life.
86000	88000	Sip in a ahoritos.
88000	90000	Hello, everybody.
90000	92000	I'm gonna go make myself some tea while we're living.
92000	94000	No.
94000	96000	Should I die?
96000	98000	Why?
98000	100000	Why?
100000	102000	No, you're okay. You can go make some tea.
102000	104000	She's like, I'm busy.
104000	106000	No, you can fuck this straight.
106000	108000	I'm gonna go make some tea.
108000	110000	You can go make tea.
110000	112000	That's fine.
112000	114000	Oh, we need to help Merci.
114000	116000	Why did this get first stream on?
116000	118000	Guys, we have been at this
118000	120000	for 26 minutes.
120000	122000	We were on Powerwasher
122000	124000	for one hour.
124000	126000	And every time we went past
126000	128000	four of the girls connecting,
128000	130000	the connection
130000	132000	started timing out for some reason.
132000	134000	But if for some reason
134000	136000	in Powerwasher,
136000	138000	if you haven't played the entire campaign,
138000	140000	it doesn't allow you to have
140000	142000	six persons in your lobby.
142000	144000	And I'm the only one with a finished save file.
144000	146000	And it was too late to
146000	148000	ship all the coding information
148000	150000	to send it on
150000	152000	on your stream.
152000	154000	Yeah.
154000	156000	And so basically,
156000	158000	Shebe rescued.
158000	160000	Shebe was like, right, I'll set this one out.
160000	162000	You guys just do it and we're like, no, we can't do it.
162000	164000	The whole point of this is that we're all together in this.
164000	166000	So then we're like, right, who's got Gmod, right?
166000	168000	I don't have it, right? Who's got RAF, right?
168000	170000	Who's got this game? I don't have it.
170000	172000	I was trying my best.
172000	174000	Shebe was like going through the list.
174000	176000	She was flicking them pages like, next page,
176000	178000	next page, next game, next game.
178000	180000	Jackbox. Okay, that won't work.
180000	182000	Literally.
182000	184000	We went, all right, we'll do Jackbox.
184000	186000	And then wait, that requires us
186000	188000	to screen record the discord.
188000	190000	I'm like, we can't have that. We see outrageous things
190000	192000	in the discord. We don't even have a HR department.
192000	194000	So we can't share.
194000	196000	So then,
196000	198000	we have a static phone,
198000	200000	which I've never played before.
200000	202000	It's coming in clutch right now.
202000	204000	Amy's currently making a cup of tea.
204000	206000	Merci
206000	208000	is just
208000	210000	getting
210000	212000	a room set up for her
212000	214000	because
214000	216000	she accidentally nuked her bot
216000	218000	of her
218000	220000	the collab stream.
220000	222000	It was a disaster.
222000	224000	This could have gone
224000	226000	any worse.
226000	228000	So just
228000	230000	I think that's like, pretty on character.
230000	232000	Yeah, if someone can insert
232000	234000	that meme and put all of her hairs on it
234000	236000	and be like, oh, aren't vTubers cute
236000	238000	when they're almost
238000	240000	or a little
242000	244000	That's all I'm going to say. Well, you guys
244000	246000	can finish the sentence after that.
246000	248000	But that was
248000	250000	I can't? No.
250000	252000	Not like that.
252000	254000	The three flings, the snowberries,
254000	256000	the billion hearts,
256000	258000	the harem, I remember I was like, okay,
258000	260000	I'm going to be honest when
260000	262000	the harem told me they were called harem,
262000	264000	I read it as harem and I was like, that makes
264000	266000	no sense for Shiby's character design.
266000	268000	I did too.
268000	270000	I was like, what?
270000	272000	I have a harem
272000	274000	of so many people
274000	276000	that are my little, you know, play things
276000	278000	and clients and they're my harem
278000	280000	and that's hair, which is a rabbit.
280000	282000	But it's not a rabbit. Hair and rabbit are different.
282000	284000	But you know what I mean?
284000	286000	It's a good pun.
286000	288000	It's a pun, exactly.
288000	290000	And they're also called harlets.
290000	292000	Individuals are harlets or harlets.
292000	294000	I thought you said hairless.
294000	296000	They're hairless.
296000	298000	Some of them aren't. I can tell you that.
298000	300000	Maryse, do you still have that
300000	302000	thumbnail, Maryse?
302000	304000	Are we good now?
304000	306000	Almost.
306000	308000	Maryse, do you still have
308000	310000	that thumbnail?
310000	312000	If you just throw up
312000	314000	on the stream.
314000	316000	Is she going to throw up on the stream?
316000	318000	Is it the are you and what are you streaming?
318000	320000	Yeah, it should default to that.
320000	322000	If you just change to the thumbnail
322000	324000	and put garlic on,
324000	326000	I'm literally telling
326000	328000	herself to stream whilst she's streaming.
328000	330000	I'm
330000	332000	dying.
332000	334000	I cannot read that.
334000	336000	Oh.
336000	338000	My goodness gracious.
338000	340000	When are they too loud?
340000	342000	Yeah, how's the volume?
342000	344000	Yeah, it's my volume.
344000	346000	Can you hear everyone else?
346000	348000	Who said the harlets
348000	350000	are waxed in my chat?
350000	352000	What does that even mean?
352000	354000	The harlets are waxed.
354000	356000	I need them to be clean and proper.
356000	358000	Volume good?
358000	360000	I see it.
360000	362000	How do I change the
362000	364000	garlic phone?
364000	366000	On managed broadcast
366000	368000	on OBS?
368000	370000	We're doing so bad.
370000	372000	They called.
372000	374000	We have the column.
374000	376000	Thank you for the 10
376000	378000	members.
378000	380000	10 gifts.
380000	382000	Don't gift right now.
382000	384000	This is awful.
384000	386000	Any gift?
386000	388000	Any gift?
388000	390000	2 o'clock.
390000	392000	Yeah, any gifters for my
392000	394000	non-monetized?
394000	396000	Oh, no.
396000	398000	She, me, and Azur aren't monetized yet.
398000	400000	Oh, my God.
400000	402000	I'm muted.
402000	404000	I was muted the entire time.
404000	406000	Oh, my gosh.
406000	408000	I can mute with her.
408000	410000	We heard you.
410000	412000	No, what is happening?
412000	414000	Oh, what is this?
414000	416000	What is this stream?
416000	418000	This is awful.
418000	420000	This is a
420000	422000	fever dream, guys.
422000	424000	This isn't real.
424000	426000	We're all in bed.
426000	428000	I don't have a garlic phone thing.
428000	430000	I guess I should change my stuff now.
430000	432000	What?
432000	434000	Why do we need to change?
434000	436000	No, you don't have to change anything.
436000	438000	As long as the game is on stream, you can change it after stream.
438000	440000	No one gives a shit what the stream is called.
440000	442000	As long as we're online right now.
442000	444000	Okay.
444000	446000	I'm just doing it.
446000	448000	The girl's running around
448000	450000	like everything's on fire and I'm like,
450000	452000	it'll be fine. We're good.
452000	454000	We're going to play some garlic phone.
454000	456000	We're going to have a great time.
456000	458000	I think the world is going to end.
458000	460000	Don't forget to like and subscribe on this stream
460000	462000	if you're enjoying your experience as a viewer.
462000	464000	Absolutely not.
468000	470000	Smash that bell to get notifications
470000	472000	of when you go live.

486000	488000	Yeah, I am.
488000	490000	Not literally.
490000	492000	I can't help myself.

516000	518000	we at Veilure have done the holistic approach
518000	520000	where none of us will mute
520000	522000	so you're just gonna hear
522000	524000	everything all at once
524000	526000	yeah

1270000	1272000	Do you think he's funny?
1274000	1277000	Because he loves me. And he's daggers and slicker with all the love he has for me.
1277000	1293080	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. Man, it's so cheesy. Faster than feet.
1293080	1301080	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
1302080	1309080	I like that poem. I like that poem. I never was stinky Pete's.
1309080	1313080	Which is Pete's feet. Oh, may I say it to George?
1313080	1317080	And then she drew pits.
1317080	1322080	I can't see. I can't see. Oh my god. That's too good.
1322080	1328080	Pete's. She's cutting out. Yeah, she's cutting out from you.
1328080	1333080	He's screaming so loud. Oh, no, not this one.
1333080	1342080	Okay, I got it from AC now. I got it from fucking AC. Thank you.
1342080	1347080	What does that even mean?
1347080	1352080	When your job is a poo, so when your poo hits your prostate on the way out, it feels good.
1352080	1356080	I love hot pees too.
1356080	1360080	What is this?
1360080	1363080	Is Amy's stocking?
1363080	1367080	Every sucker on them hot toes.
1367080	1370080	Oh wait, is she giving a blow job?
1370080	1372080	That's what it looks like.
1372080	1375080	Percy, what did you draw?
1375080	1377080	Oh, oh, oh.
1377080	1381080	Oh my god.
1381080	1384080	I love the drills. This is so fucking good.
1384080	1386080	The drills are so good.
1386080	1392080	Oh boy. We are over some pie.
1392080	1396080	Okay. That's cute.
1396080	1399080	I love that. That's a really cute toy.
1399080	1403080	Is that a cat?
1404080	1407080	Meow.
1407080	1409080	Meow winky face.
1409080	1412080	Okay, it's a winky face. I was like, what is meow us?
1412080	1415080	I was like, who? No one speaks Spanish. I shouldn't hire anyone.
1415080	1418080	Speak Spanish?
1418080	1422080	You're so fucking cute.
1422080	1426080	Oh, that's good. That's good.
1426080	1429080	That's good. I love that.
1430080	1433080	Oh.
1433080	1436080	Okay, this makes sense.
1436080	1439080	This makes sense of what on earth we were drawing.
1439080	1442080	That's a check out and that's items on the shelves.
1442080	1445080	I worked really hard.
1445080	1448080	I didn't get that.
1448080	1451080	This is like a diaper.
1451080	1454080	I see you understood me.
1454080	1457080	Oh my god.
1457080	1460080	Oh, I love the details.
1460080	1463080	Shut up.
1463080	1466080	Seriously.
1466080	1469080	I was coming out of his back.
1469080	1472080	I was going everywhere.
1472080	1475080	I can't.
1475080	1478080	I had to do the toilet stall gap.
1478080	1481080	That's all I see about when I see American memes.
1481080	1484080	Oh, the toilet is taller.
1484080	1487080	The toilet is so big you can literally look at people's eyes.
1487080	1490080	Is it a different version?
1490080	1493080	We have them closed because it's a private time
1493080	1496080	and you're very vulnerable taking a big job.
1496080	1499080	It's actually closed everywhere else in the planet.
1499080	1502080	Oh, you're so lucky.
1502080	1505080	I had people peeking at me in high school through the stalls
1505080	1508080	and I'm like, can I help you?
1508080	1511080	Me too.
1511080	1514080	Is there a check?
1514080	1517080	Is there a DC check?
1517080	1520080	Are you in the lobby?
1520080	1523080	It's going to do it on its own usually.
1523080	1526080	No, I'm gone.
1526080	1529080	The link should be in the discord.
1529080	1532080	Don't show your fucking screen on the discord.
1532080	1535080	They'll see all of our naughty photos
1535080	1538080	we just sent to each other.
1538080	1541080	It's mostly memes.
1541080	1544080	I mean, to be fair, we did share...
1544080	1547080	We did share some funny memes.
1547080	1550080	We did share some lucky nudes of ours.
1550080	1553080	They see my titties.
1553080	1556080	I started roleplaying as the girls with my nudes.
1556080	1559080	I was like, this is what Emmy would do.
1559080	1562080	This is what AC would do.
1562080	1565080	The discord is so chaotic.
1566080	1569080	Also, I did snort out my tea.
1569080	1572080	It went down the wrong hole and went up my nose.
1572080	1575080	Wow, Marcy, I hear you snort in tea.
1575080	1578080	This is what you hear.
1578080	1581080	Gotta lay off that testosterone.
1581080	1584080	It hurts so much.
1584080	1587080	Are you in game?
1587080	1590080	I posted the link in the chat.
1590080	1593080	That's why you guys were in my arms.
1593080	1596080	I'm getting another heart beat right now.
1596080	1599080	Every time she talks.
1599080	1602080	Avatar nudes are eye around nudes.
1602080	1605080	What do you think?
1605080	1608080	Oopsie.
1608080	1611080	Oopsie.
1611080	1614080	I feel like Azura could do a really good
1614080	1617080	Jennifer Coolidge impression.
1617080	1620080	Me too.
1620080	1623080	You don't know Jennifer Coolidge?
1623080	1626080	Jennifer Coolidge.
1626080	1629080	You don't know Jennifer Coolidge?
1629080	1632080	Jennifer Coolidge.
1632080	1635080	I'm such a big titty.
1635080	1638080	Oh my God.
1638080	1641080	Oh my God.
1641080	1644080	Jennifer Coolidge.
1644080	1647080	That's so good.
1647080	1649080	Why are we opening our God for the left way?
1649080	1651080	You're a G-boy, they're Razzlers.
1651080	1652080	Azura!
1652080	1653080	Drop the base!
1653080	1654080	Blah, blah!
1654080	1659080	Azura, click that link in the general discord to re-add.
1659080	1661080	Is it not letting you back in?
1661080	1663080	Are you being re-gained?
1663080	1664080	No!
1664080	1665080	I'm not!
1665080	1666080	I'm not!
1666080	1667080	I'm not!
1667080	1668080	Eh?
1668080	1670080	What is happening?!
1670080	1672080	You're making...
1672080	1675080	Your make cuts out when you do that Azura, so it just goes
1675080	1676080	EW!
1676080	1677080	EW!
1677080	1678080	EW!
1678080	1679080	EW!
1679080	1680080	What's happening?
1680080	1683080	I don't even know what's happening anymore.
1683080	1685080	It's constantly loading, it says...
1685080	1686080	Did you?
1686080	1687080	No.
1687080	1688080	Right.
1688080	1689080	It's literally...
1689080	1692080	Let me do another invite and members.
1692080	1693080	I'm sorry.
1693080	1694080	I'm sorry.
1694080	1695080	Will you guys see the discord if I open it?
1695080	1696080	Okay, you guys can't see it.
1696080	1697080	No, if you do window capture...
1697080	1698080	I'm sorry.
1698080	1699080	It's open.
1699080	1701080	I shouldn't see anything else.
1701080	1705080	I would close the window capture in the OBS just in case.
1705080	1707080	Yes, you can open it off.
1707080	1709080	Are we starting a new lobby?
1709080	1711080	A new lobby?
1711080	1714080	I think we should all invite to this lobby.
1714080	1715080	A bit of a...
1715080	1717080	Lights are too heavy.
1717080	1719080	Are we going to a different room?
1719080	1720080	I don't know.
1720080	1721080	Lights are too heavy.
1721080	1722080	What is happening?
1722080	1724080	I only see one of you.
1724080	1726080	No, I'm on my end, sorry.
1726080	1727080	A new one?
1727080	1728080	Ah, there's...
1728080	1730080	Wait, my voice is in.
1730080	1731080	Where is it?
1731080	1732080	Where is it?
1732080	1733080	Where is it?
1733080	1735080	Okay, which one should we play?
1735080	1736080	Which one?
1736080	1737080	Normal.
1737080	1738080	Which we just did.

2042080	2046080	In a galaxy far far away there was a goat with big titties
2046080	2050080	She had so much milkers and started raining milk
2051080	2055080	Azara then went home to make an empire being milked daily
2056080	2060080	It was so successful the neighboring kingdoms became champions
2060080	2063080	They also wanted so much juicy

2073080	2074080	Oh boy
2074080	2077080	Okay, long time ago in a chemical farm
2077080	2078080	Yeah
2079080	2082080	There was a polar bear princess who was trying to fit into
2087080	2090080	Their love was stronger than any foreign addiction
2090080	2093080	They couldn't stop chewing on themselves from drinking
2093080	2096080	They drink so high in my fucking stomach
2101080	2103080	I didn't know I would finish it
2103080	2105080	I was like, this agency, okay
2106080	2107080	Ding ding

2118080	2120080	I typed Azara, I'm sorry
2122080	2125080	There was a beach of agency that was lit
2126080	2130080	They all couldn't control their urges to pass
2131080	2134080	So they danced the pee-pee dance until they could
2135080	2138080	And then finally they peed everywhere on the
2140080	2143080	Floor, the walls, the bed, the kite
2145080	2148080	We're all full of piss everywhere, but he loved it
2148080	2152080	The fact that there was not even a piss prompt before AC came out with that
2152080	2156080	Literally there was only AC came out with one
2156080	2158080	AC came out with one
2158080	2160080	AC came out with one
2161080	2164080	That character added
2164080	2165080	This is so good
2165080	2166080	Okay
2166080	2167080	Okay
2167080	2170080	Once upon a time there were whores
2170080	2172080	They were the eliters of whores
2172080	2174080	A cow from the wild west
2174080	2176080	All the really cute cowgirl

2179080	2181080	So pussywarm
2181080	2186080	Big bang theory, more like bang bang your mom last time

2190080	2192080	I'm sorry
2192080	2194080	10 out of 10
2196080	2198080	Once upon a time there was a pig

2238080	2240080	Why?
2240080	2242080	Because we had a zero vote of each other
2242080	2247080	You were sad because you realized you didn't have a prostate
2250080	2253080	Why do I keep talking about shit all the time?

3939080	3941080	Things what the fuck do I need to draw next
3941080	3943080	A bleeding heart
3943080	3945080	Yeah we're more
3945080	3947080	So like building upon the characters
3947080	3949080	Rather than
3949080	3951080	Changing everything
3951080	3953080	Cause in
3953080	3955080	Someone rated the vtuber
3955080	3957080	They were like the only thing that would have been it better
3957080	3959080	Is if you let them design their models
3959080	3961080	Like from the start I'm like
3961080	3963080	Bro it took me a fucking year to get here
3963080	3965080	Like oh my god give me a fucking
3965080	3967080	I don't think so
3967080	3969080	It's never ever to

3971080	3973080	A vtuber model
3973080	3975080	You can ask Amy
3975080	3977080	She knows how to do it
3977080	3979080	It's a lot of work
3979080	3981080	Oh my god
3983080	3985080	Yeah there's only a select few corpos
3985080	3987080	That will let you do that
3987080	3989080	Oh shit
3989080	3991080	Man this is rough
3991080	3993080	Usually ones that have like artists in house

3995080	3997080	We just
3997080	3999080	This is so bad
3999080	4001080	Most companies

4015080	4017080	Yeah
4017080	4019080	That's why it's usually like cast for the roles
4019080	4021080	You have to fit the character
4021080	4023080	To the thing more
4023080	4025080	Oh
4025080	4027080	It's magic

5740520	5745800	take a take a like into me and tolerate the old accent and do apologize quite harsh sometimes
5746680	5752280	uh hope to hear more golem ASMR uh probably on twitter I have quite a few good ear licking
5752280	5758040	videos that'll go on twitter because youtube's terms of service is sadly updated or being stealth
5758040	5766360	updated and something is going on with ear licking and breathing in particular I have a sniffing
5767560	5775560	video coming out soon and it may or may not be limited uh something rather odd going on a
5775560	5780920	youtube headquarters but they don't want to publicly say it because ASMR is a one of the most
5781000	5786440	I think it's like they're in their top 10 searches so I'll be curious to see what uh transforms
5786440	5791240	accent isn't too harsh it's buttery smooth I tolerate I can hear pops did you hear that pop
5791800	5796040	is it garthik phone is that what that pop is oh it's garthik that's what it is
5797560	5804920	literally I'm like what what is that pop it's garthik um yeah you should be in dumb stop breathing
5804920	5809720	your heart let yeah I knew there was a pop I thought it was going freaking mental there I was like what's
5809720	5817320	going on oh my god the girls recovered that so well thank goodness she be uh had played garthik
5817320	5823960	phone before that's the first time I've ever played it that was so fun freaking icy seems to
5823960	5831640	be our muse we were like drawing icy icy icy I wonder if it's because because she's so recognizable
5831640	5836520	with the blue ears and short blue hair that just makes her like so easily recognizable
5837160	5841800	and then that's why we kept drawing her over and over again og suns kept getting mentioned
5843080	5851720	I did get a marshmallow from an og sun that was like thank god for thank you for giving me icy
5853000	5858760	like I'm so happy and I'm like oh I told her about it and so whoever og sun sent me that I do
5859400	5866840	I do relay messages to the girls um you know I told them I've been getting quite a few marshmallows
5866840	5873320	recently of people thanking me for picking them and it's like no no no no no it's all their work
5873320	5879640	it's their hard efforts it's their enthusiasm um and they applied do you know how many people
5880520	5886360	lurked and didn't apply because they didn't want to be the first in gen one basically um
5886600	5892040	um so yeah give up give up for the girls for doing it because they they were doing
5892040	5902440	fucking amazing um yeah blue small girl equal w it's because icy is canton hey stroney how can
5902440	5907960	I join your membership there should be a join button and if there's not then I think you need
5907960	5917880	to be on pc that's my only thing um I do have big stream tomorrow I just have wee streams today
5917880	5922680	the reason I have wee streams is because I'm trying to catch up mersey's done her monetization
5922680	5927400	so she can now upload her meme ace oh well I'll upload it on her channel she can unlist it at
5927400	5942920	any time um that's not a problem uh um what was that I thought I've just distracted myself
5942920	5946600	oh uh my streams yes I think I'm doing runescape tomorrow
5948920	5954040	yes okay we have an endurance stream tomorrow so if you've not had enough of mom our mommy
5954120	5959480	uh freaking other v-tubers are calling me mommy too I'm like yeah damn my influence is spread just
5959480	5970840	like my in the ASMR booth huh man in the ASMR booth uh stroney I am actually supposed to be blonde
5970840	5981000	or I'm a ginger because I'm Scottish in me you'd be called a ginger because your your hair's orange
5981000	5987480	so you're a ginger and to Scottish people but I don't think other nationalities like really say
5987480	5994040	ginger you thought you were blonde you're supposed to be orange like a pumpkin emi you're a pumpkin
5995240	6003160	you're my you're my little pumpkin emi but she is so blonde wait is she actually but my hair is
6003160	6011320	blonde wait am I going crazy am I colorblind but emi's ginger that's not blonde you've got a little
6011320	6018680	pumpkin hair I've shown you your concept though I mean I guess you could say like your hair is
6018680	6027480	top of your head is quite blondish I'd say your ginger ginger people have red hair don't they
6028360	6034200	gin that's what ginger people are ginger people have orange hair like you that's what ginger
6034200	6042920	voice you're a ginger emi you're a ginger emi yeah you know maybe maybe this is like cultural
6042920	6047320	different thing but you're ginger in the Scottish eyes it's kind of a strawberry blonde her hair
6047320	6052120	strawberry blonde the way I see it I thought it was orange myself yeah red hair it really is just
6052120	6057880	orange yeah I was gonna say you're not like dyed box dyed red hair I think I'm giving emi a complex
6057880	6066440	over this oops because my hair's got more reddish tint to it um to differentiate me from you
6066440	6072280	because obviously we we both didn't want ginger hair I've got like a watermelon let's say someone
6072280	6080040	explained it and there's that watermelon me strawberry has lost the plot once again honestly
6080040	6085560	I didn't concept you the with your color scheme I just went with it but your orange you're definitely
6085560	6092040	orange slash ginger in your concept or if you want to take a peek at it again um I don't have it on me
6092040	6100920	at this point in time oops um I prefer emi she's just discovered she's a yinya oh my wee emi oh dear

6107800	6112120	are you colorblind or am I colorblind one of us is colorblind in this conversation emi
6112760	6118040	because it looks too toned I am well the top half is blonde and then it blends into orange

6350120	6358200	subscribes or enjoys the content or whatever um the girls were getting ahead of me which I was
6358200	6366760	really happy about because I really didn't want to be ahead of everyone um uh but it's freaking
6366760	6371560	happened and I'm like oh go subscribe to my daughters everyone look in the description right now and
6371560	6377960	go subscribe but she be just went live I will redirect into Azura because I've actually yet
6377960	6384360	to redirect into Azura once um so I'm going to make sure I do that I'm just gonna check if there's
6384360	6391400	any marshmallows um yeah just thank you so much for your patience again as I said for some reason
6391400	6397000	power washer simulator does allow six people to conglomerate that's not the correct word
6397000	6403080	to come together to con congregate into one server however the requirements are you have
6403080	6409640	had to have completed the campaign mode so I was the only one that had done that so I was trying to
6409640	6421160	get everyone in at once it did not work um and we were like literally at the 20 minute mark and I
6421160	6425720	was like oh my god we're just gonna have to cancel this and do like guerrilla streams and come back
6425720	6433560	to this a later time but then she be she be kept me me head on me shoulders and um she said let's
6433560	6441160	do garlic phone and we could do it because originally we were gonna do that other browser based
6441160	6447960	one which I can't remember the name of oh but it was like we would have to screen record the discord
6447960	6453800	and like absolutely fucking not with the absolute shit we take jackbox that's it we would have had to
6453800	6460840	screen record at that I'm like don't don't even think about sharing that discord the amount of
6460840	6471800	inappropriate stuff we send to one another do not dare even hover over displaying discord
6472920	6479240	strani you can stream anything and we'd love every second of it thank you I'm glad I'm glad you agree
6479240	6485320	we're doing uh I think we're doing endurance uh runescape tomorrow I want to try and get level
6485320	6494040	70 cooking um we're not gonna do movies tomorrow I was actually gonna do marshmallows tomorrow
6494040	6499240	whilst we stream for a bit and then do the classic I'll start rambling about anything and everything
6499240	6504200	and then how we should be able to take over the capitalistic society and hopefully capitalism
6504200	6510680	eats itself and births a much more yeah you know what I'm saying um I will do that tomorrow so my
6510680	6516920	voice is gonna be fried my voice is actually fried from the ASMR yesterday um when I was like
6516920	6521960	roleplaying as AC I don't think AC knows that I was roleplaying as her because she didn't mention
6521960	6528520	anything of it but I was like like all of that like she didn't none of them knew I roleplayed
6528520	6533160	and I'm like yeah I should probably stay under the radar because they're like why do you think I sound
6533160	6539400	like that or something like that the revolution honestly need to see the discord chat it's just
6539400	6545000	inappropriate it's like I want artwork of me like this I want artwork of me like that oh I want to
6545000	6550200	do this with the you know the bleeding hearts I want to do this with the pin pals and I'm like
6550200	6559880	bruv it's pretty weird so much like break free reflin conspiracy stream tomorrow let's go not
6559880	6566360	exactly but uh someone said they would actually like to do like a full stream so I would have to
6566360	6572440	plan for it there's quite a few streams I want to do that require preparation time which sucks
6572440	6579160	because I have hardly any time I do have a collaboration of the girls coming out soon
6580200	6587560	one big audio which should hopefully boost everyone past 5k I was checking the statistics
6587560	6594600	and I was like why is AC and Azura not paying out the same levels and it's not because of like
6594920	6603560	this or that I looked at how badly YouTube was culling everyone it was going for AC's jugular
6603560	6610200	and Azura's throat like seriously the culling was so harsh I got culled 700 subs one day and AC
6610200	6617240	got 1500 subs culled on one day which explains why um like because the viewership between us
6617240	6626600	all is pretty much the same reef anarchy oh I quite like that Rafa Rafa and I see yeah AC and
6626600	6633800	Azura got hit hard the worst um when we were doing that culling but it's over now the culling has
6633800	6640840	stopped praise uh the lord because that was just getting so rough honestly um
6645000	6654760	uh it's really cute that you keep the bibutes to yourself why would I share that
6655720	6661880	I like it strongy silver hand is absolutely genius you would love to play
6663080	6669160	2077 I'm certain of it okay okay we'll definitely play it I'm like 99 percent sure
6669160	6674200	Rebecca's gun is in that game as well somewhere I don't know where but Rebecca's gun is somewhere
6674200	6681640	in that game snowberries are strong yeah college at world at war zombie mode was like that back in
6681640	6688520	the day we're not getting culled anymore now that we have content out we're monetized yada yada
6688520	6695800	yada we're not getting culled anymore so thank goodness for that um because that was getting
6695800	6700760	pretty rough but tomorrow endurance stream with runescape the day after we're playing crash
6700760	6708440	bandicoot warped um I'm pretty sure they remastered the game but I think that's eight hours long to
6708520	6714600	complete it so that's a nice uh it's a longer stream not endurance I think endurance is 10 hours
6714600	6719160	that's what I consider an endurance stream anything less than 10 hours and I'm like meh
6720040	6725160	that wasn't really wasn't really uh feeling it the only thing the only thing I don't like about
6725160	6730120	doing endurance streams is that I have to walk away to go tinkle or get a cup of tea or get some
6730120	6735720	food like I wish I could somehow do it all in this room so I didn't have to go away and like
6735720	6743400	me or whatever the icy train joked sladia and they were good um that disappearing game mode
6743400	6749080	was so fun trying to guess like where to draw next did you like the premium passes around the
6749080	6755640	og suns next I there I was getting bullied and he was bullying me for my scotch accent I can't I
6755640	6762600	said a word I think it was og suns because of the way it said I was oh no it was a hegeo or whatever
6762600	6769560	and she was like oh the way you're saying it I'm like surprise surprise I'm freaking scot but
6769560	6775160	the girls are such fun like mercy was a while ago like when we kind of just first got started
6775160	6780280	mercy was like am I allowed to make fun of your accent I'm like yes mercy I sound absolutely
6780280	6786680	ridiculous I know I sound bizarre it's perfectly fine mercy you can make fun of me you you do not
6786680	6791880	have to be scared that I'm gonna be like oh my god you said something that's it you're getting a
6791880	6800840	stealth suspension or something I don't know Scotland whatever it's okay have fun listening
6800840	6806360	to your accent and pronouncing stuff yeah you're like the way I see things differently yeah I'll
6806360	6817000	bet you do surprise surprise what the fuck is that ASMR video going well that I uploaded
6817320	6822840	I've just refreshed and I've gone up a hundred subscribers am I missing something
6827640	6831720	is someone posted that ASMR video somewhere
6834120	6840040	or is it just because it's like a complete meme so the way I've recorded that audio I
6840040	6843800	don't know if you guys have seen that a girlfriend begs you to let her hold the ASMR
6844280	6851320	and it probably sounds a bit different because I've purposely left in mistakes normally I like
6851320	6860680	super edit everything as much as possible but why is it picked up so much traction it should
6860680	6869320	have only got like 1k views you hit the algorithm the vid is close to 4k views you say 4k on my
6869320	6875480	end it says it's 5.4k views wait hold on I'll screenshot and show you what I see
6875480	6878840	okay I need to refresh the page so I can get the confetti
6881080	6886920	whoa that is screen recording please do not screen record that's not nice
6887640	6889640	um
6892760	6893640	does that not save
6899080	6903320	this is what I see so if you've never seen like the behind the scenes of a
6903320	6909880	an ooo to the video type thing uh this if I can redo this really quickly
6910200	6917240	did that not save it did uh this is what it looks like when you upload a video
6919560	6925720	uh it literally says like oh in four hours you've ranked by like your viewers if you have a one
6925720	6932840	out of ten you get like confetti um an impression click through rate percentage you get like
6932840	6938920	duration of how long they listen so yeah don't mind if I do I've got quite a few comments to
6938920	6949160	approve on it though I have them comments uh on approval as you can imagine because I knew
6949160	6959960	I cannot have an an agency that was a bit uh disoriented no that's not right at all um a bit um
6964520	6968520	on alternative side you know I knew the girls were gonna get harassment and stuff so everything
6968520	6973640	for us it shows 3.90 that's very cute
6976200	6981640	up next someone commented up next girlfriend begs you to let her put donuts on it honestly that's
6981640	6991320	probably the sequel um that's probably the very valid sequel don't think my comment got approved
6991480	6994120	yeah the comments are really bugged out
7002360	7005800	yeah the comments are like super bugged out for some reason when it comes to like needing to
7005800	7016120	approve them oh my god I'm not used to seeing my my uh extremities I'm not used to seeing my my
7016120	7023080	personality oh wait no that one wrong one sorry I'm not used to seeing my personality that's so
7023080	7036760	weird um I just admire in the art for the art honestly um but yes that collab was fantastic
7036760	7041720	um I did kind of do a little spoiler you know but next week the girls are doing one-on-one
7041720	7047160	collabs do you want to know who I'm taking on have a guess who you think I'm collabing with next
7047160	7054200	week from vealer from vealer take again have a gander
7057960	7063560	me and mersey oh my cat's at the door um I don't know if you can hear it it's good
7064520	7070120	um I'm playing with mersey and we're gonna be playing a game where we can go
7072520	7077800	we're gonna be playing goose game together and I'm so excited I have no idea what it's gonna go
7077800	7085720	like but I freaking love mersey um I was showing my co-worker while I'm watching brov me who just
7085800	7094600	took off my you cat oh oh so that's what you're seeing is you picked mersey I should have picked
7094600	7104920	any kind of door we ended up playing in goose game and honking out all the people I've never
7104920	7113160	played goose game before but I think I think um it's like a puzzler timing type thing so hopefully
7113160	7117400	I don't get too region as long as mersey can carry me hopefully she's played it before if she's not
7117400	7124040	played it before then we'll be looking at the snippets and the reef links to help us up through the
7124040	7137320	game um oh my god goose game yeah you split the first collab by size didn't you yes I did um that's
7137320	7143240	also how the collab or alternative audios are split for the first time I don't know if people
7143240	7150440	are gonna like isra and shabby's collab audio there will be some people who are like gonna
7151240	7156040	levitate but I know it's not for the masses please don't be mad at them be mad at me because it's
7156040	7165400	what I came up with and I quite like the idea um vealer and yumi plus um soon I can't really
7165400	7169160	say when but soon um I don't know when we can say when
7171800	7178440	it's good chaotic okay oh lord the old overwatch meme song is in psd well I was worried about name
7178440	7184120	and mercy mercy because she had a uh I think I told you I did tell you guys um she was originally
7184120	7190920	called karam beats uh in few all the way up to development about a month then I was like
7191000	7198200	I need to rename her this isn't gonna work um I knew it was a bad name but there were so many
7198200	7205800	developmental issues behind the scenes that kind of left me a bit helpless like I only had myself
7205800	7213640	to rely on for certain sections and the naming kind of ended up with me um which I can like look back
7213640	7218840	and laugh at now like that's why like I'm like oh fondle of bosom that's funny or like she be caught
7218840	7226040	in bottom oh that's funny type thing but at the time like I could cry thinking about like the stress
7226040	7231640	I was under and I felt like I couldn't like reach out to anyone in the development team side of things
7231640	7237400	because I was having a really difficult time so karam beat made it all the way through until we
7237400	7243800	got modest which means is frenched for your dressmaker and mercy if you didn't know her lore
7243800	7248760	is she's actually a fashion designer which is why her outfit is so out there and is so unique
7249320	7256360	um because it's handcrafted all that jazz um and um
7259400	7264920	mercy obviously mercy is a very big overwatch character but there's no vtuber called mercy
7264920	7271560	and I'm like mm mercy modest sounds so good and especially the yandere element of like the last
7271560	7277400	thing you'll be screaming for is mercy I think I came up with that in the development team and
7278120	7283480	like everyone just unanimously agreed there is another sentence we really like for mercy which is
7284040	7291800	um fear is a top shelf aphrodisiac that came up by largely came up by one of the audio editors so
7291800	7298280	shout out um to them they just came out with it and I was like yep we're gonna take that thank you
7298280	7303640	and I think it's in her trailer um because it was such a good sentence uh you nailed the names in
7303640	7310600	the end oh well I'm glad you agree thank god I'm not naming gen 2 or gen 3 um I don't have to do any
7310600	7318120	of that gen 2 is getting named uh for me how many people are on the development team so they're not
7318120	7324840	all listed on the website um I think uh we had a lot of comments like that they were like oh the
7324840	7330600	the team's so small the team's so this the girls don't have access to the full development team for
7330600	7338040	safety reasons and the development team do not have access to them um there's quite a lot of um
7339880	7348600	advisors I guess is the best way to call them um and it's kind of just information fetching think
7348600	7354600	of it like a fetch quest and uh like a video game just like here can you go tell this person this
7354600	7360040	deliver this letter it's kind of like that um there's a lot of people who give influence in
7360040	7368840	overall advice uh some of them are content creators some of them are long-term artists some of them
7370200	7377400	um are editor the editors give a bit of feedback which is decent the audio editors they're
7378120	7385880	um but yeah there there's a lot there's no um employees it's all contract based um
7386760	7390280	and that was one of the feedbacks like oh the company's gonna go under because
7390280	7397320	how are they gonna pay all these employees don't be so fucking stupid and that was that was probably
7397320	7404520	one of my most used phrases when violor hadn't started up yet was that phrase whenever I read
7404520	7409080	something it was like how are you how are you gonna pay all these salaries and all these
7409080	7418120	medical expenses because you'll have to offer healthcare don't be so fucking stupid seriously
7418120	7427400	don't be so daft in the head to to genuinely think that it's employee based when it is an
7427400	7432680	international company dealing with international talents like none of us have fucking met in
7432680	7439480	real life that's not how it works um like honestly some of the stuff it was like how
7439480	7449560	are they gonna pay into their pensions don't be so fucking stupid it's obviously contract
7449560	7456440	based work it's self employment contract based work like oh how are they gonna pay for all the
7456440	7465320	editors uh when we go to them and commission the job like you think we have editors on on
7465320	7473080	employee employee salary what so if they if I only give them three audios for an entire month
7473080	7483880	I'm I'm still gonna give them a full salary don't be so fucking stupid honestly some of the
7483960	7490520	feedback some of some of the feedback or that would be like the negative feedback do not even
7490520	7500920	have a fraction of a clue on how to like run stuff and it's the confidence that like to even type
7500920	7510520	such messages honestly unionize not like 401k benefit yeah like it's like it's an international
7510520	7518040	company uh what do you mean you expect us to have private healthcare for our employees it's
7518040	7528200	contract self employment based work oh my goodness oh my goodness like it's okay not to know about
7528200	7534360	this stuff that's perfectly fine that's different but to wrongly announce and criticize the company
7534360	7541480	before it had even launched and just to be so blatantly wrong oh it was my favorite
7541480	7547240	phrase in development just just take a screenshot and like show the development team and be like
7548840	7556200	oh some of this stuff was ridiculous um so it's been I have to admit it's been bloody satisfying
7556760	7562680	it's been very satisfying being like yeah we're one weekend 5k subs oh yeah one weekend monetized
7562680	7567880	oh yeah I have to admit that's been satisfying just to be like because everyone was like oh
7570120	7575400	one of the biggest feedbacks actually was that uh the girls are gonna get harassed by the development
7575400	7583320	team or something like that and I'm like don't be so stupid it's so easy not to give any developmental
7583320	7588600	staff access to the talents and what to do I've done it and it's super easy turns out all you have
7588600	7594680	to do is be an owl that's it you just have to relay messages to one team to another it's that easy
7594680	7603320	like honestly some of the feedback was like oh then it'd be so stupid me anyway that's my rant
7603960	7609240	over and done with thank you for living me to rant for one day what do you mean your
7609240	7614200	Vtuber agency doesn't have a retirement plan oh literally it was like stuff like that like
7614200	7618920	I can set the girls up long term and tell them what to do and like this is how I did it and this
7618920	7628280	is how you should do it type thing um but yeah only one man can harass them exactly like um
7630200	7636360	I spoke to like another agency owner and they were like oh everyone in their development team
7636360	7641480	like had to go through um HR training as well as the talents and I was like
7643880	7649800	I was who literally just like sexually harass each other and the discord and like send in
7649800	7653640	the front like I was like straight up sending pictures of myself and I'm like this is what I
7653640	7662760	literally like smile um so yeah the moment you called me a big girl literally I was like how
7662760	7665880	that was really creepy I'm like why did those words slip past my mouth
7667320	7672200	going to sleep right at rest well I'm gonna redirect into Azura very shortly um I'm
7673160	7679880	I'm just yapping for a little bit a little recap um why would the dev team even want to
7679880	7687240	well it happened in other high profile agencies let's just say um one agency in particular came
7687240	7694280	out and were like her talent was uh had misconduct with a team member and I was like wait you mean
7694280	7699720	your team member preyed upon your talent like the way they twisted that I was like oh that's
7699720	7703880	our that's rough to try and navigate that one mate honestly just shut up and let them go
7705400	7710360	uh stop apologizing that graphic collab is one of the best tunes I've had in five years
7710360	7716280	awww strongy love ac love emmy love shebe love azura love velia via lura love but best of all
7716280	7723400	mommy love free fling love uh hi strongy have you seen the kagaguri one six sale that's out
7723400	7730360	for pre-order can you put it on throne oh that's very kind of you but I don't think I would get
7730360	7737480	much use out of it I can't hot glue it unfortunately and I said what I said I want to hear strongy
7737480	7745000	look at her there's also that popular streamer her editor admitted to jork into yeah that kind of stuff
7745000	7752040	literally you know how you prevent all of that from happening in an agency have one person
7752040	7759560	be an owl that's it have one person relay back and forth from the talents to the development team
7759560	7764440	and that's it that's all you have to do it's super simple and easy but no one seemed to have
7764440	7770200	figured it out before me so I actually feel pretty proud of myself for just knowing off the bat how
7770200	7778920	to do that uh huh whenever something bad ish happens you should post a white paper note
7778920	7783720	some vealers official twitter the tweets wording should be ambiguous and the right on the paper
7783720	7788600	should be formal looking but tiny so people can't make out what it says from the preview but then
7788600	7793080	they open it full screen it says nobody's getting suspended and you forgive the girls for whatever
7793080	7803240	she did bro the girls cannae do any wrong like I'm sorry but like I don't know like ooh they did
7803240	7810840	a kink that's frowned upon ooh so bad ooh like oh go and just let them play video games and shut
7810840	7820440	the fuck up honestly anyway um something else to call that is a singular point failure a singular
7820440	7832360	point of failure just one okay um but they did know how to be an owl but they were too lazy to do that
7833560	7842840	uh it it it deboggles my mind um how there's not owls in other agencies all you need is a really
7842840	7849400	basic owl did you know that in magic the gathering there was a creature type called cephalid referring
7849480	7856440	to humanoid cephalopods I mentioned this because of the because tomorrow on June 14th wizards of the
7856440	7861720	coasters officially removing them from the game albeit without a public announcement only through
7861720	7866840	you know funny you mentioned magic the gathering I wanted to get into that when um
7868760	7872280	I'm no longer busy but I'm not allowed to say it
7872760	7879640	but they complained about sheebie to whom huh
7883160	7888280	oh no it's something I don't like better light the beacons honestly it's like
7888280	7894600	why don't you shut up like I feel like we're all just like on the same page where it's like
7894600	7900600	just shut up and walk away if you don't enjoy the content it's really no that hard
7901880	7907880	like I will continue to engage in the content that makes me upset and outraged and then you wonder
7907880	7913720	why like you've got anxiety you've got depression you've got a fucking array of a list and then you
7913720	7917800	keep participating in the shit that puts your body into fight or flight because you feel so
7917800	7931320	passionate about the thing that upsets you like brav just fuck off and see what who what a message is
7931320	7946040	this and I enjoyed your girlfriend begs you to let it hold it is the mom oh
7948760	7956920	is someone who's writing poetry and my freaking marshmallow my hygiene is better than a frenchie
7964360	7967880	is the one manager enough for six talents
7969320	7975800	well let me reverse the question if you have an agency where the girls do not need to come to you
7975800	7980200	for approval for streams approval on what they need to do approval for this approval for that
7980840	7988600	what do you need to manage is my question the only thing was audios was my job but it's no longer
7988600	7995160	my job because I have an audio manager in place so I don't even have to do that now so my question is
7995160	8000360	what do the girls need help with because Azura's got her donut on coming up so I'm gonna work with
8000520	8006040	her one-on-one on that and it's like you don't need a full-time person to come in and manage you
8006040	8011480	know I don't mean that in a mean way I don't mean to be like I just mean like like seriously if you
8011480	8017800	are genuinely curious like if you run an agency where the girls need permission for you every single
8017800	8022120	week when they submit their games to you or like what they want to do that week yeah of course you're
8022120	8027000	going to need a manager because you've forced that you've forced the hand of needing a manager
8027000	8035000	running your agency like that if you say you know what girls you are adults I'm going to treat you
8035000	8040360	like an adult you can decide on whatever you want to do if you need advice you come to me I'll tell
8040360	8049000	you what I did or what I think would work well for you and yeah it completely negates the need of a
8049800	8058040	a general manager now if the girls ever came to me and said I cannot think for myself I don't
8058040	8065800	I want to stream but I can't think that's when I would create schedules for them and notes about
8065800	8073000	what game I've selected or what zatsu or what theme I can do that you know it's very hands-off the more
8073000	8077720	controlling you are the more the more headache you're causing for everyone the talents become
8077800	8082280	insecure in their choices if you're rejecting their schedules and
8085640	8091480	management itself will start to feel burned out and tired because they're having to abide by these
8091480	8095800	rules of saying like oh this girl isn't allowed to play this game because of this reason but that
8095800	8100840	girl that girl's fine she's allowed to do that because of this reason no you're just causing
8101560	8108600	headache and heartache for no reason these girls that have applied for your agency they
8108600	8115800	have saw a vision they have saw success in your plan for you to turn around and not let them cook
8115800	8124680	as the as the saying is is just ridiculous you're just causing upset among all the ranks like if
8124680	8129560	the girl if the girls ever came to me and said look I'm struggling to pick games guess what I've
8129560	8134440	already wrote them a guide with loads of listed out games and if that's not enough then guess what
8134440	8137960	I'll work one on one with them and pick out their schedule and pick games out that I think are
8137960	8142040	accessible to them or what they'll enjoy I'll do my research like it's really not that hard to
8142040	8152440	enable your talents it's really not that hard um potentially tech upgrades yes so that's up to
8152440	8158360	the girl with the 80 20 split so it's just just turning into agency stream again I'd like to I
8158360	8163160	like talking about the behind the scenes though because I don't mind yes when it comes to technology
8163960	8171000	so some agencies will take a percentage out of their earnings to put back into technology
8171000	8177960	we have said to the girls look the split is 80 20 whatever you do with your 80 percent is up to you
8178600	8184600	and you know if you choose not to upgrade your equipment if you're not satisfied with it
8185080	8191160	honestly that's not on us you know that's not on us at that point um like I'll say it to their feet
8191160	8196040	like they already know like the girls are all on the same page if you're getting an 80 split 100
8196040	8203080	merch sales um and a few other things coming up um yeah if if their technology's bugging out or
8203080	8211320	they need something new and they don't pay for it themselves look brov brov we did offer a streaming
8211320	8218200	kit so if the girls needed like basic iPhones for track in or microphones or a pc in someone's case
8218760	8224600	um yeah we did purchase it on their behalf type thing but yeah mommy is doing so great and good
8224600	8229800	job as you can hear so glad she caps about all literally I don't know why like any of it should
8229800	8235800	be a secret it's just like this is how the agencies run I'm sure no one is surprised um
8236200	8242520	um I love listening to you talk about these things really love getting to see your passion
8242520	8250360	um it's um like literally like I'm giggling away being like oh I've just turned the ic stream off um
8256280	8262680	that's wrong but uh sorry there's a ic just added me on timing um
8263000	8268920	um yeah no I honestly don't mind talking about it oh obviously development took a year and I've
8268920	8275080	kind of said like one of the criticisms we got was that the girls weren't allowed to pick their designs
8275960	8282120	it took a year for the models to get here it took a year for the concept or it took a year like
8282840	8289080	brov in the nicest way I am very aware that idol in lets their talents pick designs and that I can
8289080	8296360	hear Gimli meowing um pics or designs and all of that we do not have a development team like that
8296360	8302920	I do not have six model artists and six model rigors on standby at this time at this schedule
8302920	8309880	that's just not possible for me especially with the way the cut works like if if I were to even
8309880	8315960	offer that the cut would not be 80 20 that's just not possible in such a budget we would have to pay
8316040	8323240	special rate Gimli I'm almost finished do you want in the room right right you'll get in the room
8323800	8330040	sorry let me let Gimli in Gimli in you come
8331720	8335960	then don't be surprised when I'm talking to myself like a crazy person in the room okay
8336920	8343400	and don't go in the cupboard right Gimli has pika where she chews plastic you want on my lap
8343480	8347160	where are you you want on my lap or do you just want to be in the room

8353960	8359320	ah since you're meowing your head off look that's them there look there's reeflings there do you see that
8361320	8365320	they like that I called you Gimli after lord of the rings because you're ginger
8365320	8370280	and you're a girl are you squid me are you a girl cat Gimli sorry
8372520	8379720	main and your pet have the exact same name literally she had ginger on her I don't even

8385800	8393160	a hoarder home weren't you yes you were you had she was in a cat a
8395720	8399880	you just walked out the room no that's right that's right come here come back on my lap

8407400	8413000	man hearing you talk about this girl expertly and passionately so great because I can feel my
8413000	8418040	tism going off like spider said she's just like me for real for real or I can thank you for the 10
8418040	8426360	um yeah like I honestly don't mind like uh some of the other feedback we got was like oh no males
8426360	8431880	absolutely nothing's stopping you for opening up a male agency mate good fucking luck for that the
8431880	8437720	only reason I can do chicks is because I have chick experience isn't isn't that crazy man blowing
8437720	8442440	concept Gimli isn't it she's currently rubbing my chair right now it's absolute mind blowing
8442440	8448840	concept where I can't manage guys because I've never made content as a guy my staggering beyond
8448840	8456040	belief absolutely earth shattering information revealed yeah the only reason I can hire chicks
8456040	8460920	is because I've got experiences of chick like my god what am I gonna say I did oh yeah just
8460920	8468680	fucking I don't know what do what games the guys play that girls don't play um oh yeah go play
8468680	8474120	Tarkov for eight hours like what am I supposed to do I don't I don't what do you want from me
8474120	8481720	go make your own freaking VTuber agency then like go divided have fun just remember to plan
8481720	8485480	like double the money whatever money you think it'll cost double it and then add some more because
8485480	8494760	that's exactly what happened to me um wait strong is a girl oh my god she knows what we're doing no
8495640	8502600	oh no Tarkov players and shambles I've never played Tarkov but I or like rust but I think
8502600	8509240	those are very very guy games we'll make her own refling agency with men in black jackets
8511080	8517640	this is all there was like such random feedback sorry I think oh no she's not she's still in the
8517640	8524520	room are you okay so my cats are neutered but it looks like she's peeping and she when she
8524520	8530120	shakes her tail and she just did it there because she thought I was getting up to feed her you've
8530120	8536200	got dry nibbles down Gimli don't don't make the reeflings think I starve you they're gonna burst
8536200	8542040	into the house Gimli and it's all your fault and then again I could just burst into the reeflings
8542040	8548520	house so do you wanna come with me Gimli on an adventure we can go to a reefling and she's now
8548520	8553880	clawing my chair for attention because she knows that's how it gets me off my chair because I always
8553880	8563080	work suddenly sleeping strongy yes when I look away my model descents and why is because it's
